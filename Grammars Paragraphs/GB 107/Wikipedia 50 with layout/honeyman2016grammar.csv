ive reply to a polar question (§10.3.2.1, §10.3.2.2). Clause-initially, it can
indicate that one disagrees with with someone else’s assertion, or to invert
the assertion of a prior utterance, as in (b). If the polarity of the clause
is already negative, though, the negative does not invert the assertion of a
prior clause, but rather reiterates it, as in (c).(12.44) (a) M: An=ti        Buafo=ti=fa?       A: Momu.

Momu also functions as a two-place predicate for “not having” (§11.10).
   In notes by Baron (1984, p25) on Western Momu, the verb is nominalised
(or linked according to his glossing). This appears to indicate that origin-
ally, or independently for Western Momu, negation was or is treated as a
complement-taking predicate with a deverbal complement.

      ‘I did not go’12.2.2    onfa Modal negative
As a complement-taking predicate (§16) onfa takes a sentence-like comple-
ment with a broader range of inflectional possibilities than the negative
particle momu (§12.2.1). Sentential complements to the predicate are usually
marked by the oblique, functioning as a complementiser.
   Onfa is used with non-verbal predicates (§11.9).         Depending on the
class of predicate of the sentential complement, combined they can express
non-equivalence (§11.9.1), negative attribution (§11.9.2) or negative location
(§11.9.3). Negative possession is expressed by the negative particle momu
functioning as a two place predicate (§11.10).
   Momu lacks a means of negating specific entities within a clause such as
adverbs, quantifiers, or constituents (Payne, 1985). Nor are there lexical neg-
atives to achieve this. Instead, this is usually achieved over multiple clauses,
with the relevant entity expressed as a predicate, and it is the predicate that
is negated.
   So, for instance, a single clause translation of (roughly, as this is not
possible in English either) “I will tell a non-big story” or similar, is not
possible in Momu. Instead, such information must be spread over multiple
clauses, as in (12.49).

12.2.3        Other sites of negation
Negatives are rarely expressed lexically in Momu. There are a handful of
complement-taking predicate that incorporate negation into their semantics
(§16.1.10). For instance, efiyeni ‘not want’ (§16.1.4.2), kwobo ‘not know /
be ignorant of’ (§16.1.7), and titwer ‘forget’ (§16.1.7) all lexicalise negations
of positive counterparts (and bear no resemblance to them) .
   The prohibitive inflection (§12.1.1.5) is used to indicate disallowed ac-
tions.
   Three modal adverbs code negation. Biom ‘inability’ (§9.6.3) and bie
‘non-permission’ (§9.6.4) code negated modal values. A negated reciprocal
clause can be coded by a specially marked form of akfu ‘reciprocation’.
The directional and restrictive combine to form akfu=ti=s ‘unreciprocated’
(§10.2.2.3).","[441, 442, 443, 444]"

As these are the only examples of such TAM marking, and because there
are non-grammaticalised readings of the inanimate existential, further work
is necessary to clarify if these are actual examples of variation in the stance
predicate.12.1.2.2      =m onfa Modal negative predicateThe modal negative is a fixed form which takes no inflection.18 Variation
in the form of the sentential complement to the modal negative contributes
to the modal value. The complement to onfa may be a non-verbal predic-
ate, in which case the predicate type determines the nature of the negation
(§11.9).19 The complement may also be a verbal predicate, in which case it
can be inflected for the imperfective, perfective, realis progressive, or voli-
tional future (§12.1.2.3).
       A plain unmarked (perfective) verbal stem with onfa conveys a meaning
roughly equivalent to a negation of the stance predicate (§12.1.2.1).20 That
is, the speaker uses the construction to indicate their stance on the matter as
being opposite (or diﬀerent) to the sentential predicate. Thus, the diﬀerence
between the form in (12.37) and a negative particle equivalent (fienu momu
‘It is not a lie’) is that the particle version is a statement of fact: it is not a
lie. The speaker knows or believes nothing of alternative possibilities. The
utterance in (12.37) is a response to disbelief.21(12.37) Mony=e wob            na-pwen                        eru.

  18
     The shape of onfa does not obviously indicate a verbal past but the marking of the
complement with the oblique =m does. Onfa may be related to the verb on ‘see’ with
the polar question marker =fa, but there is no compelling evidence for this.
  19
     In fact, for non-verbal predicates, onfa is the main form of negation.
  20
     In §12.1.2.1, I tentatively conclude that the stance predicate has a negated form
wu=momu ‘it is not the case that....’ The subtle meaning diﬀerence between this con-
struction and use of onfa is certainly in need of further investigation, especially because
of the complementary stance qualities of onfa.

"16.1.9     Phasal predicates

16.1.10     Negative predicates
Negation via a CTP is a rare strategy amongst the world’s languages (Noonan,
2007, p144). Momu is a language where synchronically, one of the two neg-
ation strategies (onfa ‘modal negative’) is clearly a CTP.11 This predicate
codes propositional attitude (§16.1.2) and deontic modal predicates (§16.1.3)
depending on the form of the (verbally predicated) complement.
    For non-verbal predicates in complements, the CTP onfa is the only
strategy for negative equation, attribution (shown in (16.32) below) and
location (§11.9). The other negator momu also functions as a two place
predicate to code negative possession (§11.10). Issues of scope and other
features related specifically to negation are discussed in §12.2.
  11
     There is some evidence that the second negation strategy (via the particle momu)
used to operate on a nominal clause as well (§12.2.1).",[573]

11.9      Negative equation, attribution and location
Negation is performed by two diﬀerent negators in Momu regardless of
whether the predicate is verbal or otherwise. The “modal negative” 12 onfa
is verb-like in that it takes a single oblique-marked complement. The other
negator is the two-place predicate momu (§12.2). Because the modal negat-
ive takes a clause as its complement, the range of possible clause types that
can be negated using it is broader. The negative predicate momu, on the
other hand, only expresses negative possession.",[405]

11.1     Structural overview
Before examining each construction type individually, I discuss features com-
mon to them all.
   A number of constructions in this section involve the combination of a
single noun phrase (the subject), and a predicating element drawn from a
word class outside of verbs, or a phrasal element. The word class or form
of the phrasal element determines the nature of the predication, be it equa-
tional, attributive, possessive, locational or purposive. Negation involves
either a complement-taking predicate that takes an entire clause as its com-
plement, a final negative particle, or a lexical negative.
   Common to all are a subject NP (§11.1.1). In §11.1.1.1 I discuss discourse
pragmatic factors that can make identifying the subject problematic. Also
common to all is the manner in which adverbs modify the predicate. In
§11.1.3 I discuss the position and nature of adverbial modification of non-
verbal predicates.","[387, 388]"

3.5.5.3     Negative particle momuThe negative particle momu functions as a sentential negator (§12.2.1),27
as a negative possessive predicate (§11.10), and as negative response to a
question (§10.3.2).",[140]
"
11.11         Other negatives
The two negation strategies discussed above (§11.9, §11.10) do not form neg-
ative counterparts to all positive strategies. Here I briefly examine additional
negating strategies and areas where negation is unclear or unavailable.
       The status of negated purposive predicates is unclear, but (11.45) may
be an example.13(11.45) God=u           fekob fei-monwu momu. Fei momu.

      ‘God’s place is not for anger. There are no fights.’                         rich-fool  13
    The singular genitive can at times be hard to distinguish on lexemes with a final
/u/, as it will often come down to a subtle diﬀerence in vowel length. The translation is
ambiguous in tp as well: bilong is both a marker of possession and purpose.",[407]

postposed ones can often be taken to be paratactic (§16.6).(12.42) (a) Bufo       wobu           emse,      a-bufwar

12.2     Negation
As noted in the opening of this chapter, negation can be thought of in terms
of alternatives as the ultimate alternative: the opposite. Negation is a univer-
sal feature of language, with coding being via a verb (or predicate), particle
or adverb (Payne, 1985). In Momu, negation is primarily coded via a particle
momu (§12.2.1) or a negating predicate onfa (§12.2.2). There are few altern-
atives available for coding negation in Momu (§12.2.3).12.2.1    momu Negative
Momu is a simple negator when applied to verbal predicates. The form of
the negated verb is limited to perfective (unmarked) or imperfective-marked
stems. No additional modal marking can occur. Momu cannot be used with
progressive-marked forms or non-verbal predicates.","[440, 441]"

bined with the modal negative. Given that negation describes a “non real”
situation, the usual expectation might be that an irrealis or subjunctive
should be used (Payne, 1985), especially in the context of a formally sub-
ordinate clause (Palmer, 2001).22 Palmer (2001) argues that the role of the
subjunctive in a negated context is of expressing doubt on the part of the
speaker. It may be that because the speaker is asserting a stance or position
counter to another, the realis here indicates surety on the part of the speaker.
If the speaker instead wanted to express doubt, the irrealis progressive form
of the stance predicate would be used instead (§12.1.2.1).",[438]
"11.9.1     Negative equation
Negative equation is expressed by embedding an equational clause (§11.2) as
the complement to the modal negative onfa.(11.40) (a) Anu bofu=m           onfa,       anu=ne       ebsi ma.

with the modal negative onfa. Attributive clauses as expressed by the pro-

interaction with other modal markers. This is only the case with verbally predicated
complements, however.",[405]

people of Mori village, Sandaun Province, PNG. Many Mori people helped
me—more than I can name—but I especially have to single out Bernard and
Monica. Bernard, your often poetic descriptions breathed life into complex
problems. Sometimes, banging my head against the wall, a quick aside from
you was the inspiration for a lengthy detour through a hidden grammatical
side-path that I didn’t realise was right in front of my eyes. Monica, your
levelheaded explanations kept me on task. Your stamina in plodding through
some of the more tedious aspects of gathering texts and paradigms is awe
inspiring. And your ability to bridge the gap as my Tok Pisin developed and
intuit what on earth I was talking about was astounding. I honestly don’t
think I would have got this far without your patient guidance.
    In Mori, thanks also to Antonia, Simon, and Peter Yefiye for your as-
sistance with stories and with elicitation. Thanks Flerwick, Kaspar, Julie,
Luke, Peter and Angela, and Agnela for your contributions to the stories
we collected. To Steven Arame, thanks for your assistance both in matters
linguistic and logistic. I hope in my own small ways I was able to repay some
of your kindness.
    In terms of staying alive in Mori, it was really thanks to the generosity of
some key people who Fiona and I will always be indebted to. In 2005, thanks
to Flerwick, Yasu and your lovely family—Osi, Slupi and liklik Luk —for
hosting Fiona and I, but thanks also to Monica and to Julie for helping out
with food. To Primus, thanks for hosting me in 2008. There’s nothing like
lengthy late night conversations about the meaning of life to hone one’s Tok
Pisin, let alone sort out one’s priorities! In 2010, thanks to Kaspar and Keti,
and your wonderful family (Mambe, Andrew, Rachel, Mina, Larry, Maiklin,
Irene, Karl, Glenda, Ann and Ian) for hosting Fiona and me. You were truly
generous with us, and we really enjoyed being part of your family. Thanks
again for looking after me in 2012 as well.
    In Savamui village, thanks to Ferdi and Yarin for your frequently hilari-
ous tales. I really enjoyed working with you both, but also just chatting.
You both have a wicked sense of humour! Thanks also for your hospitality.
Thanks also to Denis, and to little John. Thanks to Dianne and Andrew
Solmo for hosting Fiona and I during walks to Savamui in 2005.
    Thanks to the people of Mumuru village for hosting Fiona and I for those
two weeks in 2010, and to Antonia and Francis for putting us up. After a
rough patch in our fieldwork, we truly felt welcomed. I only wish that I had
planned to spend more time in your lovely village.
    Thanks to all those many people who contributed to the big singsing
at Mori, Savamui and Mumuru. Thanks also to the very many people who
shared their food with me, and helped in other ways. Sitting on so many
balconies and shooting the breeze with so many warm and welcoming people
was to me the best part of working in PNG. Lewa bilong mi i stap wantaim

to my mother, Ann Tout, for helping out with Neve in the final stages.
   Finally special thanks to my partner Fiona. This turned out to be quite
the journey, from those heady early days adventuring around PNG to where
we are now. Honestly I couldn’t have done it without you. Thanks for your
support, emotional and practical, your (not insignificant) patience and, well,
for everything!
AbstractThis thesis is a description of the grammar of Eastern Momu, a language
spoken in Papua New Guinea in the north-western province of Sandaun.
This is a region with a fair amount of diversity, with several isolates or small
language families, and few detailed descriptions. Momu, or Fas as it is more
commonly known in the literature, together with the virtually undocumented
Baibai language, forms one of these small language families.
   The thesis is structured such that after a general introduction to the
people, language, and region, I give chapters covering: phonology, phonot-
actics and morphophonemics (Ch. 2), word classes (Ch. 3), nominals (Ch.
4), noun phrases (Ch. 5), verbs (Ch. 6), aspect (ch. 7), grammatical re-
lations (Ch. 8), adverbs (Ch. 9), clauses (Ch. 10), non-verbal predicates
(Ch. 11), modality and negation (Ch. 12), serial verb constructions (Ch.
13), compounds and coordination (Ch. 14), subordination (Ch. 15) and
complementation (Ch. 16).
   At first glance, Momu has a relatively uncomplicated five vowel phon-
ology, or ten vowels if one includes length. Glides hold a special position
within the phonology, phonotactics and morphophonology, as I have ana-
lysed it. Glides interact heavily with adjacent segments including metathesis
with adjacent consonants in a predictable fashion. Additional phonetic long
high vowels arise from some glide-vowel combinations. Amongst the conson-
ants, there is a bilabial trill. This is an areal feature that is rare amongst
the world’s languages.
   A marked feature of the verbal system, but also areally, is a relatively high
count of verbs coding verbal number. Verbal number in Momu is conservat-
ively estimated to occupy 30% of the verbal lexicon, placing it at the upper
end of the typological space. The theme of verbal number runs throughout
the thesis as its relatively high frequency makes for contrastive behaviour in
certain domains.
   Momu has some classically ""Papuan"" features such as serial verb con-
structions and verb-final ordering (albeit not strictly so). This thesis aims
to position Momu within the growing body of work describing the incredible
features, number and variety of languages of Papua New Guinea, but also to
focus on a region within Papua New Guinea with perhaps a higher degree of
diversity and lower total count of documentation overall.

Chapter 1Introduction1.1    The Momu language and its speakers
The Bewani Ranges are in the north-western corner of Papua New Guinea, in
Sandaun Province. They stretch from the border with West Papua eastward
to the Torricelli Ranges. At the eastern end of the Bewani ranges, there are
two strings of villages—one each on the northern and southern slopes. Momu
is spoken in these villages. An intricate web of tributaries flowing from the
ranges has created vast deltas on either side. Some maps indicate that the
language spreads north to the coast, but this is not the case. The villages are
spread out over a large area, with as little as an hour’s walk, but sometimes
up to two day’s walk between them. With so much distance, intermarriage
or other direct contact between the eastern-most and western-most villages
is unheard of.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"

10.3.3     Imperative
Imperatives in Momu are coded by inflection on verbs. I restrict the present
analysis of imperatives to the traditional conception of the imperative as
a category only applying to second person referents (König and Siemund,
2007). I do, however, briefly mention some other strategies at the end of this
section (§10.3.3.2) for imperative-like meanings (many of which extend bey-
ond second person referents). The negative imperative is treated separately
in the context of modality and negation (§12.1.1.5).","[383, 384]"

Chapter 12Modality and Negation      “Modality is about alternatives—how we come to know and speak
      about the world, how the world came to be as it is, whether it
      might be other than it is, what needs to be done to the world to
      make it what we want.” Timberlake (2007)This chapter is about the grammatical means of expression of alternatives.
In this spirit, it includes the expression of negation (§12.2)—what Timber-
lake (2007, p316) characterises in a footnote as “a pure operator of modality”.
Modality marking hints at alternatives, and by inverting a proposition, neg-
ation presents a possibility but asserts its opposite. While modality and
negation are grouped together here in the one chapter, I do however treat
them as separate topics, with significant points of overlap.
   Modal categories relating to sentence types such as the imperative (§10.3.3)
are treated separately in §10.3. A subset of adverbs indicate modal categor-
ies; these are briefly reviewed in §9.6. Some construction types involving
these adverbs overlap in function with the modal categories discussed in this
chapter.","[416, 417]"

momu with a predicate adjective. The speaker (Flerwick) is middle aged,
but is one of the younger speakers that I worked with. I include this here as
a possible extension of the verbal negator momu as an attributive negator.
But more conservative speakers would not consider this grammatical.(11.42) (a) yeko eru, ukumos             to-r         anow momu.

11.9.3    Negative location
Negative location is coded by embedding a locational clause (§11.6) without
a copula as the complement to the modal negative onfa.","[405, 406]"

The perfective and volitional future forms of the stance predicate are far less
common across my corpus. Further investigation is necessary to understand
possible variation in the form of the complement to these forms, as not all
of the combinations otherwise seen with the irrealis progressive form of the
CTP (wuta) have been observed.16.1.2.3   =m onfa Modal negative predicateThe negated counterpart to the stance predicate is the ‘modal negative’
onfa. As with the positive counterparts, only the oblique is used as a com-
plementiser. Viewpoint aspect can be marked on the complement. If the
complement is in the progressive then only the realis form is used.","[562, 563]"
"16.1.2       Propositional attitude predicates
Propositional attitude predicates are similar to utterance predicates in that
there is a transference of information. In addition to this, the speakers
attitude towards the veracity of that information is expressed.
      In Momu, the attitude towards the information can be coded as neutral
or negative, on the basis of the form of the complementiser. A neutral or
favourable attitude by the speaker towards the proposition is coded by the
oblique complementiser case =m, and a skeptical attitude is coded by the
restrictive complementiser =s.
      All complements to propositional attitude predicates precede the CTP,
indicating that these are more syntactically integrated than complements to
utterance predicates.
      The complements are sentence-like (§16.6), and allow for the marking of
viewpoint aspect (§7.1). Modal marking is not allowed, except for some com-
plements which can be marked with the volitional future, usually marking
asserted desire, intention or obligation.4 Some complements discussed here
can be non-verbally predicated.16.1.2.1       =m/s yeni ‘I say (assert/think)’The personally held belief of the speaker is commonly asserted with the
speech verb yeni with a pre-predicative complement. The oblique =m as
a complementiser indicates a neutral attitude by the speaker, as in (16.9a),
and the restrictive =s indicates a skeptical attitude, as in (b). Nominally
predicated and volitional-future-marked complements are possible. The pro-
gressive matches the complementiser: the realis form couples with comple-
ments marked by the oblique and the irrealis form couples with complements
marked by the restrictive.

      See also §16.1.3 for deontic modal predicates.",[561]
"12.1.2.3     Negative permission or potentialThe sentential complement to the modal negative onfa can only be marked
for the volitional future. No other modal inflection can be used. The meaning
conveyed by this combination is one of (12.39a) negative permission or (b)
lack of potential.(12.39) (a) Ne a-naakni

    The context for the utterance in (12.38) is of Bernard describing a woman who in
the course of a video clip enters from outside the frame. The video plays, and stops, and
freezes on the first frame with the woman out of frame. Bernard then makes the utterance
(12.38). The woman is known to both of us, and in a sense is “present”—just not visible.",[438]

For verbal predicates, there is a contrast between simple negation as ex-
pressed by the stance coding onfa, and simple negation by momu, as shown
below.

Complements marked by the volitional future code a propositional attitude
layered over a deontic modal (§16.1.3). Non-verbal predicates of comple-
ments to onfa code simple negation (§11.9) rather than negated stance.
       Both stance and its negated counterpart only allow realis progressive
complements. This strikes at the heart of the modal nature of these con-
structions in the terms that I defined for modality in §12 (i.e., that Modality
is a consideration of alternatives). While it may seem odd that a realis form
applies to a negated proposition (i.e., to something that isn’t so), it is in
the diﬀerence between the negation types that the reason for this becomes
clear. In the examples above, the perfective complement to onfa in (16.12a)
indicates that speaker asserts that a past state of aﬀairs did not hold, and
hints or implies the alternative: that this state of aﬀairs holds presently, or
perhaps in the future. The plain negated form in (16.12b) is less nuanced.
A past or present state of aﬀairs doesn’t hold, and no implication is made
about the present or future. Given such an explanation of onfa, employing
a realis progressive within the complement makes sense.
       A realis progressive complement to onfa indicates that a state that the
speakers know to be relevant doesn’t hold at the moment of utterance. Such
an utterance implies, however, that it shortly will be so. In the example
below, the speaker is anticipating that what isn’t initially true at the time
will become so when the video he is describing progresses.7(16.13) Bernard describes a video where he knows that the first referent in
         this example is initially out of frame.","[563, 564]"

10.2.2.2       Lexical reciprocalsThere is a nominal form akfu glossed as ‘reciprocate’ or ‘reciprocation’ in the
examples below. Akfu is likely the combination of the reciprocal-emphatic
particle ak and -fu, an inflection found in some kin nouns, and for indicating
sister exchange marriage referents (§4.7).
       Akfu is used to construct “weak”, “negated” and “non-simultaneous” re-
ciprocal meanings (König and Gast, 2008). In particular, akfu is used in con-
structing multi-clausal reciprocal constructions (Evans, 2008), as discussed
in the section following this one.
       Some basic negative-reciprocal uses of akfu are given in (10.21). There
are three negating strategies involving akfu. In (a) the lack-of-possession
predicate momu (§4.6.2) is used.14 In (b) the modal predicate onfa (§11.9)
is used to negate an identificational use of akfu.15 In (c) restrictive marking
on akfu indicates that an action performed was done without reciprocation.(10.21) (a) Akfu=ne            momu.
             reciprocate=foc neg
           ‘There was no reciprocation. (lit. as for reciprocation, he didn’t
           have it)’                                                yarin-tumbuna
         (b) Akfu=m             onfa.
             reciprocate=obl neg.mod
             ‘That is not reciprocation.’                                          2008.338
         (c) Akfu=ti=s                te    on.
             reciprocate=dir=rstr 1sg see[1|3sgS]
             ‘I saw him, but he in turn did not see me.’                           2008.470       I have yet to discover other forms which lexicalise specific acts of recip-
rocation (e.g., English kiss or marry). The verb seyen ‘exchange marriage’
does appear to lexicalise a reciprocal event (or an event with the strong
cultural expectation of reciprocation). Examples are discussed in the next
section.
       A curious example is given in (10.22) which roughly describes a reciprocal
act, without the use of any of the markers described above. The verb soi
‘deal out / distribute’ is used to describe the (normally) non-reciprocal act
  14
     A positive counterpart to (10.21a) using a proprietive strategy (§11.5) would be te
akfu=bu ‘I have reciprocation’.
  15
     A positive counterpart to (10.21b) using an identificational strategy (§11.2.1) would
be anu akfu ‘this is reciprocation.’

of a subject dealing out food or other items to a group of people. A simple
example is given in (10.22a). The verb does not index T or G arguments,
but I have analysed it as transitive where the O is the theme, given that the
verb does not take object prefixes. In (b) the verb is transitivised to add a
recipient (G), and the meaning shifts to that of exchange.(10.22) (a) Esy         eru so-si.

           ‘They dealt out the sago jelly.’                          ferdi-tumbuna
      (b) Spears are marked with a unique pattern that indicates their
           owners and are used to identify who shot the prey in hunting.
           The shooter has rights over the prime cuts of meat. Exchanging
           spears before a hunt is a gesture of good will, as it might result in
           handing over these rights.

10.2.2.3   Multi-clausal reciprocalsAkfu can also signal a reciprocal action with looser temporal structure. Here
I survey several uses of the form in multi-clausal constructions. Akfu means
‘in reciprocation, in turn’ in these constructions, and accompanies a one-way
action embedded in a larger discourse containing reciprocation.
   (10.23) starts by describing a basic event without reciprocation: yime eru
mu erum memam sakyetuw ‘The man wipes the woman’s cheek.’ Subsequent
reciprocal actions are then marked by akfu either clause-initially or preceding
the predicate.","[367, 368, 369]"
"16.3.1    Valence and CTPs
For Momu, few CTPs fill a core argument with a complement. Arguably the
most syntactically integrated complements fill the sole argument position for
the CTP. Most propositional attitude predicates (§16.1.2) (and associated
deontic interpretations, §16.1.3) are one-place predicates; namely the stance
predicate (§16.1.2.2), the modal negative (§16.1.2.3) and the ‘seems’ CTP
(§16.1.2.4). Commentatives coding judgements, as expressed by attributive
predicates, are also one-place predicates (§16.1.6.2). Such CTPs tend to
show the greatest degree of grammaticalisation.",[575]
"10.3.1       Declarative
Declarative clauses are used to assert or report states of aﬀairs. These include
complaints, bragging, predicting and promising (König and Siemund, 2007).
       Declaratives in Momu are the default, unmarked sentence type. There
is no specific marking, however the emphatic markers -e and -a are pos-
sibly a component of certain sub-types of declarative speech-acts. Further
investigation is necessary.
       Declaratives generally take an (unmarked) rising-falling intonation con-
tour over a simple clause type. However, as with every generalisation, there
are exceptions. Complex clause types such as coordinated structures have
more complex intonation patterns. In §10.3.2.4 I briefly review declaratives
with parenthetical questions mixed in. There is also a marked post-posed
participant strategy where the predicate has a terminal contour, and the
post-posed element has a marked rising contour (§8.1.3).1610.3.2       Interrogative
Interrogative sentences are sentences typically intended as a request for in-
formation from an interlocutor. Interrogative sentences in Momu include
polar questions, where the veracity of an assertion is being sought, and con-
stituent questions where content relating to constituents are being sought.
A reply to a polar question might be yo ‘yes’ or momu ‘no’, or something
in between.17 A constituent question (§10.3.2.3) involves a question word
(§3.5.3). A reply to such a question might minimally be the sought-after
constituent, or may mirror portions of the question as well. The example
below includes both a constituent and polar question. The first sentence
  16
      There are definitely extra-clausal post-posed participants (topical afterthought), but
the pattern described is in addition to this. Further investigation is necessary to confirm
it however.
   17
      Between the absolute poles of true and false, replies can be epistemic in nature (e.g.,
aisena ‘who knows? / maybe’, or a form of the epistemic stance marker (§12.1.2.1)), or
even a question in return.",[377]

neither reduced nor subjunctive in Momu. Instead it is an unreduced form
of the complement, and specifically, the marking of the volitional future that
signals a deontic meaning. In Momu such a meaning cannot be achieved
without being embedded within a propositional attitude predicate. The
deontic component is not being coded by the CTP, and so this should be
considered a variation from a propositional attitude predicate, not a separate
CTP type.","[565, 566]"

irrealis progressive construction, the distinction across the progressive is ac-
tually three-way. By locating the participants in an event, the speaker (or
asserted knowledge holder) is indicating that in knowing where they are,
they have reason to hold that knowledge as real. In situations where this is
not the case, the speaker must use the irrealis form of the progressive.
       Making an inflectional deictic distinction on verbs is unusual but not
unheard of. More commonly aﬃxal deictic distinctions might be considered
cliticised adverbial form, for instance, a rich system of spatial distinctions
including proximity which in some way aﬃx to the verb is not uncommon
in North American languages. For example, in Kwakwala, amongst a large
inventory of suﬃxes which “reflect the natural environment in which the
language is spoken” there is a suﬃx -em̀ ‘nearby’ which indicates proximity
(Mithun, 2001, p149). However, unlike the distinction required in the Momu
progressive, these are not obligatory categories. The Papuan language Berik
makes a two way distinction on verbs between an unmarked activity and
verbs marked with -tet to indicate that the activity occurred at some distance
(Westrum, 1988, p153).10
       Diachronically, the Momu distinction is possibly closer to a grammat-
icalisation of motion verbs (§C.4). In the North American language Nez
  10
       Berik also marks the spatial distinction of relative height (Westrum, 1988).","[284, 285]"

C.2        The modal inflection -mamu
There is an inflection -mamu which I presume to be some kind of modal
marking. It clearly exists in older texts but is longer in use in the area where
I conducted fieldwork. Here I simply compile all the information that is
available on the form.
       I suspect that this form was formerly the interrogative or subjunctive
counterpart to the volitional future. I presume that the volitional future has
subsumed this function (in combination with interrogative marking, §10.3.2),
which has rendered -mamu redundant. In the absence of any further data,
I base this hypothesis on the (former) parallel relationship between the epi-
stemic future (in the declarative) and hypothetical future (in the interrogat-
ive) (see §12.1.1, and especially Table 12.1 on page 392).
       This form appears sporadically throughout the older Global Recordings
Network texts (§1.5, §2.6.2) from 1973. While not expanding upon it, or
giving any examples, Baron (1984) also lists the form amongst the others
discussed here in his unpublished grammar notes.9
       In the instances from the Global Recordings Network text “rich-fool”, uses
include setting up unreal possibilities like that in (C.15a). Synchronically,
speakers of eastern Momu use the hypothetical future -me (§12.1.1.3) for such
a construction. In (b) the utterances have a roughly subjunctive flavour, but
the translation of this section of the text was diﬃcult for my informants.10
(c) shows that -mamu could be used with the modal negative onfa (§12.1.2.2,
§12.2.2), which heavily restricts modal marking otherwise.11 In this way it
is similarly as flexible as the volitional future -mu (§12.1.1.1).","[655, 656]"

These uses indicate that there is an additional use of the prohibitive which
is more like a hypothetical (non-negative) exhortative. Further investigation
is needed to confirm this pattern, however.(12.28) (a) Watch eru yey-en=be,

12.1.2    Modal predicates
Modal predicates express a variety of modal qualities that operate over
the entire clause. All forms are more or less complement-taking predicates
(Noonan, 2007), some of which have fused or reduced. All show a degree of
                                      402
grammaticalisation (§16.3.2), either by a reduction in form or a reduction in
inflectional possibilities.
       The components of these constructions in Momu are a sentence-like com-
plement, a complementiser, and a complement-taking predicate (henceforth
the modal predicate). All three have variable forms across the construction
types discussed below.12.1.2.1       =m wu Stance predicateThe inanimate existential verb wu has grammaticalised as a form of epistemic
stance marking which I label (and gloss) the ‘stance predicate.’ The form
encodes the speaker’s subjective assessment of the state-of-aﬀairs described
by the complement, relative to a temporal oﬀset established by inflection on
the predicate.
       Stance is a broad and varied topic across the literature (see Engelbretson
(2007) for an overview of diﬀerent approaches), but here I am singling out
just one component of stance. Following Engelbretson (2007) I take stance
to be a subjective, observable, interactional, indexical and consequential
phenomenon. As such, many examples of the stance predicate occur in
dialogic, natural and unscripted interactions between speakers, especially in
tasks like the social cognition picture task (San Roque et al., 2012), where
the speakers in one phase of the task are jointly attending to constructing
a narrative based on a series of images. Amongst possible instantiations of
stance, here the stance predicate codes mainly epistemic stance. Stance can
also code emotional attitudes and judgements of a given proposition. Such
meanings are coded by other complement-taking predicates in Momu, and
are examined elsewhere (§16.1).
       In the simple exchange below, two speakers are working towards identi-
fying the unknown elements in an image.13 Monica signals her tentative
position with the stance predicate in (d).
(12.29) Monica and Antonia identify objects in a
      picture                                                     picture-task-part1:image-3         (a) M: Yeko anu, oton    n-o-wo
                true this put.one px-[impf]inan:there.be-3sgS:nzr
  13
    In the exchange in (12.29) Monica first signals that she is guessing at identifying
the object in (a), using a parenthetical question kwus o? (§10.3.2.4). Antonia responds
without progressing the identification by simply parroting it back in (b) and (c).","[430, 431]"

taking predicate (§12.2.2).
       Most lexemes have low semantic density. In terms of exponence, typically
only one or two categories are encoded in a single morpheme. Subject or
object are always combined with number. The multipart progressive (§7.4.2)
includes a deictic distinction in the realis form (§7.4.2). As part of the
progressive, and other constructions, nominalisation and subject marking
are fused into portmanteau morphs (§16.5.1.1). On nominals, the genitive is
combined with number (4.8.5).
       Like many non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea, the basic word
order of a simple clause in Momu is S(O)V (Dryer, 2007b, 2011) or simply
verb-final (Foley, 1986, p10). In Momu, all participants in a clause typically
occur before the verb and observe a fixed ordering (§8.1.3).35 Nominal heads
are post-modified (§5.1) excepting nouns modifying other nouns (§14.1.2),
adpositions are postpositive (§3.5.1, §9.1) and relational and adnominal case
marking is post-positive, upon dependents (§4.8.1). This is in line with
the general expectation for S(O)V languages. Possession is variably marked
(§4.8.5): small closed nominal classes include genitive- (pronouns, §3.5.2) or
possessive-marking (possessed kin, §4.6.2). Genitive phrases can freely occur
before or after the head that they modify (§4.8.5.2). Inalienable possession
(relating to body parts and houses) can be unmarked (§14.1.2.4), and is often
externally possessed (§10.2.1).
       In “tight” verb or verb phrase coordination (i.e., serial verb constructions,
§13), the final verb is usually the prominent host of inflectional categories.
In looser coordinative structures, each predicating verb may host inflectional
categories. Manner is most commonly indicated by serial verbs (§13.2.1), but
small sets of adverbial forms also occur in a similar (preverbal) position in
the clause (§9.4, §9.3.1, §9.3.1).
       All adverbial subordinators occur on the right edge of the clause (§15),
some both pre-modify and post-modify main clauses (often with a diﬀer-
ence in meaning), while others are fixed on one or the other order. Nominal
modifying subordinate clauses occur in the same position as other lexical
modifiers, after the head (§15.1, §15.8). Complementisers also occur after
the dependent clause (§16.2). Depending on the complement-taking predic-
  35
    Verb-final order is not strictly so, like in languages like Ku Waru (Merlan and Rumsey,
1991). There is a (seemingly increasingly common) pattern of postposing a single non-
subject participant after the verb which should not be considered topical afterthought
(§8.1.3). Certainly though, the dominant word order is clearly S(O)V.","[55, 56]"
"10.3.3.2   Related formsHere I briefly survey some imperative-like meanings in Momu. I consider
these as non-imperative as they can apply to more than second person ref-
erents.
   In (10.52a), the main-clause use of a deverbal clause (§16.5.1) can be
used alone to express deontic modality. In (b), the second dual subject form
was given in elicitation for imperatives restricted to dual number. In some
circumstances, the subject-inflected root is used for commands.(10.52) (a) Wakeb          ai-u.

in elicitation for granting permission or exhortation directed at third person
referents. In (10.53b), the combination of the volitional future with a first
person plural or dual subject expresses a jussive. In (10.53c), second person
(impersonal) subjunctive subordinate clauses can be deontic (§15.5.3).(10.53) (a) Wok      fe=ina-se!

Chapter 11Non-Verbal PredicatesIn this section, I examine diﬀerent types of non-verbal predications. This
includes lexical non-verbal forms like nominals and adverbs and phrasal ele-
ments like noun phrases and adverbial clauses, all of which function as pre-
dicates of clauses in Momu.
   The major classes of non-verbal predications common cross-linguistically
include those that express equation, attribution, location and possession
(Dryer, 2007a; Payne, 1997; Stassen, 1997). All are expressed via non-
verbal predicates in Momu, but attribution and location also have verbally
predicated counterparts or can be linked by a copula (§11.12).
   The juxtaposition of noun phrases is used to express equational meanings
(§11.2.1). There are also a number of juxtapositions where the function of the
predicate is indicated by adnominal case marking. There are two negating
strategies (§11.9): a general negating strategy for negated equation (§11.9),
attribution (§11.9.2) and location (§11.9.3), and another strategy for lack of
possession (§11.10). Lexical negatives, verbal or non-verbal, are not common
in Momu.
   While the title of this chapter implies a division between verbal and
non-verbal predicates, the reality is somewhat more of a cline. In the final
subsection (§11.12), I look at instances where the predicate sits between
nominal and verbal form. In this section I note where non-verbal predicates
have verbal counterparts, and where there is no verbal counterpart.","[385, 386, 387]"

      ‘Go put the little stone there.’                   space-game   A -mu marked clause is future-oriented with respect to a certain tem-
poral origo, which is understood to be the time of utterance by default,
though other readings are possible in context. There are no grammaticalised
means in Momu for explicitly indicating the time of the predicated event or
state relative to the moment of speech. Instead, that time is constructed,
understood or inferred by the speaker from the context of the utterance. As
such, in the right circumstances, the matrix-level clause marked with the
volitional future can be understood to be indicating a past desire (fulfilled
or otherwise).
   In the exchange (constructed in elicitation) below, two people discuss
shooting a captive pig. Speaker A establishes that someone has already
done this. In their response, speaker B uses Teb niymu ‘I wanted to shoot
it.’ In the context, that is understood as a non-future reference time.

           ‘Did/does he want to shoot it? I wanted to shoot it.’The volitional future is not generally used with non-human agents. Inferred
future events triggered by non-human causes are generally expressed via the
epistemic future -meta. The one exception to this is meteorological events.
These are sometimes marked as volitional acts, particularly in those cases
where the outcome is unfortunate for someone.
   (12.10) is drawn from a text where Antonia talks about how the river is
constantly changing its path (to the point of causing mischief for the users
                                     394
of the river). At times, Antonia tells this from the perspective of the river
itself. Sometimes she uses the volitional future -mu for the whims of the
personified river.7 At other times the epistemic future -meta is used. In the
example, Antonia reverts to -meta after first using -mu.

So far, all examples have been in the declarative mood (§10.3.1). The voli-
tional future can also occur in the interrogative mood, in both (a) polar and
(b) constituent questions:
(12.11) (a) Maky oto-ti-mu=fa?
             middle put.one-come.down[1sgS]-vol.fut=ynq

       Where sentential complements to complement-taking predicates permit a
limited amount of modal inflection, the volitional future is the most common
inflection allowed. Amongst predicates taking sentential complements, the
modal complement-taking predicates are of particular interest when com-
bined with the volitional future. The combination of the modal negative
and volitional future expresses inability (§12.1.2.2). The combination of the
stance predicate and volitional future expresses desire or necessity, while the
stance predicate provides the overall modal and temporal frame (§12.1.2.1).12.1.1.2      -meta Epistemic futureThe “epistemic future” marker -meta indicates possible events, outside the
control or intention of the agent, and outside the knowledge or control of the
speaker. This includes events where something accidental might happen as
in (12.12a), or where the outcome is out of the speaker’s hands (b).8
   7
     The river in this text is also marked as animate by the form of the existential verb.
The river watches the people washing in one location and then moves so that they have
to move again to collect fresh water and wash.

     In this example, the speakers have just finished a task, and one asks the other if they
have performed the task correctly. (b) is the response.","[422, 423]"

Imperfective marking is possible with the stance predicate as well. The
realis–irrealis distinction in the progressive (§7.4) is layered with the pro-
gressive form of the stance predicate. Only the realis form can be used for
the sentential complement, and only the irrealis form is used for the stance
predicate.
   The realis progressive form in the complement in (12.34a) is used when
the speaker subjectively asserts a current and ongoing state of aﬀairs as
probable. The imperfective in (b) expresses past imperfective, and this is
given a modal flavour by the irrealis form of the stance predicate. The irrealis
progressive (ai- V -ta) and the stative form ( V -ta) cannot be used in the
complement.

Core aspectual distinctions like directional inflection appear to be unrestric-
ted in the complement, but further investigation is needed.16
       Finally, I tentatively include some additional examples here that may fall
under stance.
       A negated form of the stance predicate is shown in (12.35). Further
investigation is necessary, including comparison to an extremely similar use
of the modal negative (§12.1.2.2). The repetition of momu in (12.35b) is
clearer as a stance-like usage. The speaker weakens his conviction as the two
participants argue over identifying elements in a picture they are looking at.(12.35) (a) Mo kub=ti          erenu         wu=momu.

the rare apprehensive marker -ma (12.36a).17 (12.36b) demonstrates a po-
tential stance predicate in the realis progressive, but this is possibly just a
non-grammaticalised use of the inanimate existential. If it is stance, then
this is a confident assertion on the part of the speaker, but one that is being
put forward as an opinion nonetheless.(12.36) (a) Wob          yeb kuw                  wu-ma.

     Natural occurrences of the stance predicate are rare across my corpus as there is
a limited amount of natural discourse. Elicitation of variation in form has so far been
problematic as it can be diﬃcult to set up the right context for some forms. Again, further
investigation is necessary. The social cognition picture task was especially helpful in
unearthing identificational examples of stance as the pictures are deliberately inconsistent
so as to force negotiation of identity between speakers (San Roque et al., 2012).

also mentioned above the influence of the “etic grid” approach of stimuli kits
developed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. These became
an invaluable source of exploration while on fieldwork.
       While back at the ANU, a weekly “grammar group” became a platform
for a group of junior and senior grammar writers to discuss the grammar
of a broad range of languages and a broad range of topics. This group was
particularly formative for me, both in the exposure to other ways of looking
at the same problems that had developed in localised traditions of gram-
mar writing,25 and in presenting arguments about grammatical structures
in Momu and in other grammars and typological papers in an environment
where they could be dissected by many interested minds. It was a fascinating
insight into typological variation, thanks to the many languages represented.
It was also an excellent avenue for discussion of just what a “grammar of a
language” could or should be.
       When it comes to situating Momu in the linguistic world, I have tried my
best to describe the language in its own terms. In particular, I have tried to
strike a balance between the use of abstract representations of structure, and
long form prose as two tools that aid in modelling structure and expounding
meaning. My approach to grammar writing is, I think, unconsciously influ-
enced by R. M. W. Dixon, who in turn had an influence on the generation
of grammar writing linguists in Australia by whom I was taught. Dixon
himself has named his approach as “Basic Linguistic Theory”, however, I am
reluctant to use the term. I believe that theoretical frameworks are models
that more or less fit a problem at hand. I very much agree with Dryer (2006)
that I am engaging with descriptive theory, rather than explanatory theory.
It is enough for me to attempt to answer the question of “what languages
are like” without being caught up in why.
       There is very little literature or data available for languages putatively re-
lated to Momu, and so a diachronic consideration of Momu cannot incorpor-
ate a thorough application of the comparative method until some substantial
work has been done on the languages spoken around Momu. However, I tend
  25
     For instance, the Oceanic tradition of grammar writing is very much grounded in
or perhaps served by the reconstruction of Proto-Oceanic. But also, the terminology,
distinctions and assumptions around broadly evident features of Oceanic languages are
assumed by insiders but at times opaque to outsiders. I don’t mean to single out Oceanic
languages here—discussing other languages and language families with other grammar
writers in the grammar group made it clear that this was very broadly the case for other
language families as well.","[49, 50]"

       2sg be.hungry-2sgS-appr/-epi.fut
      ‘You might get hungry.’The form -mene is mostly used for prohibition, but appears to extend to
other situations discussed in §12.1.1.5. It is not limited to second person
referents, however, and so I do not consider it a negative imperative.
    The form -mamu (§C.2) is very rare. On the basis of older texts for which
I do not have reliable translations, it appears to apply within subjunctive-like
contexts.6

ficantly with the person of the subject (Lehmann, 2009). The modal inflec-
tions are also heavily restricted in subordinating contexts. A restricted set
of modal markers can combine with modal predicates. These are considered
separately in the context of modal predicates (§12.1.2).12.1.1.1     -mu Volitional futureThe most commonly occurring modal inflection is -mu ‘volitional future.’

     Given that the volitional future occurs in both declarative and non-declarative con-
texts, but the epistemic future and hypothetical future are instead limited to declarative
and non-declarative contexts respectively, it is possible that -mamu is a remnant of a
former contrast between the volitional future and -mamu, such that -mamu was used in
non-declarative contexts, and the volitional future was formerly restricted to declarative
contexts. Further investigation is necessary, but for this reason, -mamu is placed in the
non-declarative section of Table 12.1.","[419, 420]"

9.6      Modal adverbs
There are a handful of modal or modal-like meanings expressed by adverbial
forms.
   Activities that persist counter to expectation are marked with the ad-
verb mo ‘ yet/still’ (9.6.1). Attempts and inability are expressed by modal
adverbs. Common to these modal adverbs is oblique (=m) marking, fused
into the form of (fe)sim ‘attempt to’ (§9.6.2) but synchronically separable
from bio(m) ‘inability’ (§9.6.3). Negative permission is coded by the adverb
bie (§9.6.4).
   In some cases these modal adverbs are the only way of expressing such
means, in other case they are complementary to existing modal marking
which is primarily achieved via marking on the verb (§12.1.1), or via “modal
predicates” (§12.1.2).9.6.1    mo ‘yet/still’
Mo is a shortening of mory ‘wait.’ This is possibly a recent innovation as I
have not found it in older (and particularly Western Momu) texts. Mo signals
that the activity described by the clause is not yet complete or fulfilled, it
also has a secondary function as an “emotional” element (De Roeck, 1994),
especially in direct reported speech and thought (§16.1.1).
   Most commonly the form is used in non-future oriented clauses, and
especially negated or interrogative clauses. As such it can occur with the
irrealis progressive (9.23c). In the right context, it can occur with a perfect
clause, as in (d), where the prior utterance by Monica sets up a proposition
counter to expectations, which Bernard maintains with mo.(9.23) (a) Mo abo ai-momu-ya.

          ‘Place it in the spot coming from downriver!’   space-gameMo has a secondary function as an emotive element. It is very common on
the left edge of reported speech with or without a quotative verb. While not
formally a quotative marker, the emotive element, alongside changes in vocal
quality (i.e., shifting into character), flag the utterance as an instance of dir-
ect reported speech or thought. Within her typology of reported speech, De
Roeck (1994) called such elements expressive or emotive elements. In com-
bination with shifter elements and other categories, such elements variably
combine to mark direct or indirect reported speech or thought.
    4
      The use of mo with the volitional future in (9.24b) is possibly enabled by the reading
of the clause as hortative.","[345, 346, 347]"

glides. Mid-high vowels are pulled higher by a neighbouring glide (§2.1.4.2),
resulting in a diphthong or phonetic long high vowel. There are no non-
complex high vowels in Momu.
       The glides are fragile. In the absence of an adjacent vowel, they are either
devoiced or deleted. Glides aﬀect the surface realisation of both consonants
and vowels (§2.1.3) by palatalising or labialising consonants and raising or
rounding vowels. Glides occupy a special position in the phonotactics of
Momu as well. The ideal basic syllable (§2.4) has a preferred linear order-
ing of consonant-glide-vowel. In some combinations of morphology where a
final glide meets an initial consonant, this preference triggers metathesis to
generate the preferred ordering of segments (§2.5.1.1). More generally, non-
meaningful metathesis of consonants is a reasonably common occurrence in
Momu, so much so that it initially obscured a genetic aﬃliation with Baibai
(§1.1.1).
       Momu is somewhat analytic, with concatenative morphology mostly oc-
curring in the domain of verbs (§6).29 There is a single nonlinear formative
indicating third person singular subjects via ablaut: a rounding operation
of the right edge of a stem (§2.5.1.3). This leads to phonologically driven
syncretism when there is no suitable candidate for rounding,30 as first per-
son singular subjects are the unmarked form of verbs (i.e., zero-marked).
Multiple morphological processes form verbs (§6.3). Diﬀerent sets contain
diﬀerent patterns of syncretism (§6.4). Some transitive verb-forming sets in-
corporate object marking (§6.3.3.1) and some form transitive verbs without
object marking (§6.3.3.2, §6.3.3.3). Although verb formation is common,
there are also many monomorphemic verbs (i.e., free roots).
       Word forming strategies create verbs with selectional properties that pat-
tern on an absolutive basis (i.e., the aﬀected participant). Reasonably com-
mon amongst verbs is a pattern of stem alternation such that two diﬀerent
verbs select for the number of an argument along absolutive lines (i.e., verbal
number, §6.6).31 In fact, the ratio of verbal number pairs to other verbs in
  29
      The average verb is very commonly unmarked (usually indicating first singular subject
and perfective categories), but most commonly will be marked for subject cross-reference,
aspectual and or modal categories via a single morpheme in a single slot for each of these
three.
   30
      Syncretism of first and third person singular subjects is essentially driven by the lack
of a rounding candidate on consonant-final roots. In glossing, these are readily identifiable
in examples throughout this thesis as they have an inferred gloss of “either first or third
person singular subject” ([1|3sgS]).
   31
      In grammar writing, this pattern is very commonly referred to as “suppletive number”
                                             26
Momu exists at the upper end of what is typologically evident at this point
in time (Corbett, 2000). As such, most commonly the stems are regularly
derived (§6.5, §6.6.2.3), while a minority are represented by completely diﬀer-
ent (§6.6.2.1) or partially recognisable forms (§6.6.2.1). Some word-forming
“aspectual suﬃxes” (§7.5.2) also pattern on an absolutive basis. A directional
suﬃx indicates the location or path of an aﬀected participant (§7.5.2.1), and
the incompletive suﬃx indicates the state of completeness of the aﬀected
participant (§7.5.2.4).32
    Momu has large open classes of verbs and nominals, with small closed
subclasses within them. Nominals have minimal inflectional categories, mostly
of the dependent marking kind (§4.8), outside of small closed classes like
pronouns (§3.5.2), or possessed kin terms (§4.6.2). The verbs are really the
powerhouse of the language, especially in the context of extremely common
elision of topical referents. As such, it is not uncommon for clauses to almost
entirely consist of sequences of verbs (§13).
    Momu has a nominative-accusative system of agreement. A basic rela-
tional case system diﬀerentiates subjects from non-subject arguments via
an oblique case marker, which also marks most other kinds of non-subject
(§4.8.2, §8.1.2). Subjects are nearly always cross-indexed on verbs (§6.2.1,
§8.2.1), objects less so (§8.2.2).33 Predicates can be verbal or non-verbal,
with many intransitive predicates coded by non-verbal forms (§11). Trans-
itive predicates are almost exclusively coded by verbs. There is a single pair
of ditransitive verbs: no/tu ‘give one/many’ (§3.1.2.3). Momu employs ex-
istential verbs as copulas (§11.12.3) and only in this very restricted case does
one find irregular word orders, and a diﬀerently coded subject (§8.2.1).34
    Considering the other inflectional categories of verbs, Momu possesses a
classic viewpoint aspect system of the kind where perfectives are unmarked
(§7.2) and imperfectives are marked (§7.3). Modal categories are suﬃxed on
verbs (§12.1.1), and there also exists a small set of “modal predicates”, the
majority of which concern epistemic stance (§12.1.2). Negation is marked on
clauses via a final particle (§12.2.1) or typologically uncommon complement-
or “number suppletion”. For the reasons I lay out in §6.6, I will not be continuing this
tradition here.
  32
     Aspectual suﬃxes are primarily concerned with the internal structure of the event.
  33
     Variation in the treatment of objects is both common and clear enough in Momu to
be treated as a split (8.2.2).
  34
     The split in the coding of subjects is not significant enough to justify labelling it as a
“split subject”, however.","[53, 54, 55]"
"11.2.1      Equation and proper inclusion
Both equation and proper inclusion are expressed by the juxtaposition of
two noun phrases. Equation is where both NPs refer to the same entity
while proper inclusion (or what Dryer (2007a) refers to as “true nominal
predicates”) is where the reference of one can be thought of as being a member
of the set expressed by the other (Payne, 1997, p114).5 In English the two
    5
      Stassen (1997) refers to equational construction types as “identificational”. In doing
so, he points out that assigning notions of argument and predicate to this sentence type is
problematic. Grouping equation and proper inclusion together here is a decision based on
equivalence of basic form. I recognise, however, that there are good grounds to treat them
separately. A structural point of diﬀerence that is noted in this section is that juxtaposed
elements in an identificational or equational construction in Momu can commute without
altering the overall meaning, while the juxtaposed NPs expressing proper inclusion cannot.",[392]

              ‘Those feathers cannot grow quickly.’                           kaspar-kokomoThe modal adverb biom ‘inability’ conveys a similar meaning, and can either
mark it independently, or occur alongside the volitional future and modal
negative combination (§9.6.3).12.1.2.4       =meni Inceptive, DesiderativeMeni is at best a marginal predicate, sitting part way between a free form
and a modal inflection. The form originates from a fusion of the oblique =m
(functioning as a complementiser) with yeni ‘say to’.23
       Meni retains some verb-like features in that it still inflects for agreement
with the shared subject of the sentential complement. It cannot inflect for
aspectual or modal categories, however, and nor can the complement itself.
In the absence of any further modal marking either on the final verb of the
complement or on =meni itself, the form is in complementary distribution
with the other modal inflections (§12.1.1).24 However, unlike other modal in-
flections, the inceptive can occur in subordinate clauses that require deverbal
complements, and in this case are the host of the nominaliser.
       The examples below demonstrate the inceptive sense of =meni. All these
examples involve some form of connection with a subsequent clause which
details the completion of the full event. In (12.40a) two clauses are linked by
a sequential adverb yeb ‘then’, while in (b) and (c), the inceptive is embedded
within a temporal adverbial clause. In all examples, subject marking occurs
on both the inceptive marker =meni and the verb to which it is attached.(12.40) (a) Fisbu         peru ney=meni                           yeb,

             and
  23
    The older and separate form =m yeni is recorded by Baron (1984).
  24
    The distribution of =meni with respect to other modal inflections can be taken as
an indicator both of the direction of grammaticalisation of the inceptive, but also of the
development of other modal inflections in Momu (§16.3.2).","[438, 439]"

       It is reasonably common for the speaker to question the reference of a
participant in the middle of a declarative sentence. Both forms of polar inter-
rogative are used parenthetically in Momu. In this use, a regular declarative
clause is interrupted by a questioning of the identity of a given reference.
The queried quantity is marked either with the polar interrogative =fa or
a combination of the restrictive =s and disjunctive o. These are delivered,
often without pause or change in regular declarative intonation. As such,
the explicit marking of elements makes it clear that the overall statement is
asserted, but specific sub-elements are still in question.21(10.49) (a) ¿Anu=efa? pwen-e.

In Kwomtari the form used for polar questions can appear finally or in second
position (Honsberger et al., 2008, p168). This appears to be a diﬀerent us
however to that given here for Momu, but similar to the way in which the
restrictive is used for subjunctive-like clauses. The Kwomtari form pe as
given is used for polar questions, hortatives, and more generally epistemic
modality.
  21
    I have tried to represent this mixed sentence type in translation by placing a paren-
thesised question mark after the questionable element. Alternatively, a fully expanded
translation for (10.49a) might be “This one—is it this?—came.” This doesn’t represent
the degree of integration into the main clause, however.","[382, 383]"

14.4       Adversative coordination
Adversative coordination is an interpreted meaning of intonational coordin-
ation (§14.2). The adversative meaning is not overtly marked as such, but is
rather interpreted from the lack of cohesion of the events in the coordinated
clauses.
   In (14.54), the adversative reading is clear from the semantic incompat-
ibility of the coordinated clauses. In (a), the desires are conflicting and in
(b) one cannot be ruined by someone else, and ruin oneself. More or less
common to all is that the subjects contrast between coordinated clauses.(14.54) (a) Ni wakf-a-si           ... ni   pana-si-mu,              te

Specific adverbs in the second clause, or combinations of modal or aspectual
marking across clauses can signal particular adversative meanings. The ad-
verb fesis ‘again’ signals a concessive meaning in (14.55a). In (b), the second
clause specifically indicates negative reciprocation, in contrast to the first
clause. This is one use of the adverb akfu ‘reciprocally’ (§10.2.2.3). In
(c), an inceptive-marked clause (§12.1.2.4) frequently sets up an adversative
reading when the following clause is in some way incompatible.22 Use of
the adverb yesy ‘just’ in the second clause in such adversatives leads to a
substitutive (in the sense used by Thompson, Longacre and Hwang (2007,
pp263–264) for adverbial clauses).(14.55) (a) Pwe=a=m                  oton,             fesis esyu

Oﬀers to an interlocutor where the interlocutor can determine the outcome
are typically marked with the epistemic future. In this case, the outcome is
outside the speaker’s control, and the speaker is applying no force by making
the oﬀer.

Indeterminate future events controlled by inanimate forces (typically met-

             ground rain come.down\3sgS-epi.fut
             ‘Rain might fall.’       The heterosemous free form meta(i) functions as a verb.9 Unlike the
bound inflection, this form takes inflectional categories, and it can be used
in serialisation, as in (12.15a).10 In this preverbal position it is often proclitic.
It can also stand alone as an inflected verb, as in (b) and (c).(12.15) (a) Te metai           pi-mu=a?
             1sg what.do[1sgS] one.goes[1|3sgS]-vol.fut=q
           ‘How will I go?’                             picture-task-part1   9
     Diachronically, the form most likely comes from the fusion of the prefixing form of the
hypothetical future marker -me (§12.1.1.3) in combination with the verb ta(i) ‘do.’ In fact,
this may be a valid synchronic treatment of the free verb form. In Baron’s unpublished
grammar notes he records -meta as being optionally inflected for subjects (Baron, 1984).

     A nominalised form of the verb is also used as an interrogative pronoun (§3.5.3)

As a serial verb, it appears non-finally, which means that the combination
of a verb plus the inflection cannot be mistaken for serial verbs.12.1.1.3     -me Hypothetical futureThe modal inflection -me indicates a possible or potential future action in the
interrogative mood. I have tentatively labelled it the ‘hypothetical future.’
The analysis here is correspondingly tentative, in the absence of enough
examples to provide a proper analysis.
    The form is quite rare. I found it either in the context of meteorolo-
gical events, or in questions of ability or potential. The hypothetical future
occurs only in interrogative mood and is the natural interrogative partner
to declarative uses of the epistemic future -meta (§12.1.1.2). Specifically, it
occurs in polar interrogative combinations. Most commonly this is the polar
question marker =fa (§10.3.2.1), but it also occurs in a few constructions
with subordinating uses of the restrictive marker =s (which in such contexts
often creates conditional clauses (§16.6.2)). For instance, it can occur with
the disjunctive o to create a kind of unfulfilled tag question ‘might it be or...
(not)’ (§10.3.2.2), or with the modal predicate =s on ‘might it seem that...’
(§16.1).11
    When in a question–answer pair the corresponding positive answer is
marked with the epistemic future -meta.

   11
      The hypothetical future can also be used in sentential complements to a small range
of complement-taking predicates that accept irrealis or interrogative complements (§16.1).","[423, 424, 425]"

15.7        Absolutive clauses
The term “absolutive clause” comes from Thompson, Longacre and Hwang
(2007) and refers to a subordinate clause lacking an overt marker of the rela-
tionship between it and the main clause. In Momu, this is the subordinating
use of a deverbal clause, with none of the marking otherwise described in
this section. The adverbial role of such a clause is determined from con-
text, in much the same fashion as otherwise unmarked clausal coordination
(§14.2.1.3).
       A thorough analysis of the (quite broad) range of possibilities within this
type is beyond the scope of the present work.14 Instead, I present a sample of
the kinds of meanings expressed via absolutive clauses. Interpreted functions
are given in the translation in parentheses. In the majority of cases, the
interpretation is of consequences.
(15.50) (a) Ay nua-f-mu                te=m

           sing-1|2sgO:vtr-come.up-nzr

    Briefly, an avenue of future exploration would be the insubordinative uses of deverbal
clauses (Heine, Kaltenböck and Kuteva, 2016). While I am aware of such uses in Momu,
they were rare enough that more data gathering would be necessary to give a proper
explication.","[543, 544]"
