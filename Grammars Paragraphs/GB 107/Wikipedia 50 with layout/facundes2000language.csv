6.7.2       Subordinator Particle         There is also one clear case of a subordinator particle, which is kotxi (or kota, dependingon speech variety) ‘because’, as the example in (35) illustrates. The syntactic properties of thissubordinator are presented in chapter 9, in subsection 9.1.3.1.
 35. nu-su-pe-ka-ko                  kotxi nu-sãpaka
     1SG-go-PFTV-PRED-FUT because 1SG-be.tired
     ‘I’ll get going because I’m tired.’6.7.3 Polarity Particles: Negative, Positive         The polarity particles are simply the word forms used to answer polar questions. Theyare kona ‘not, no’ and aru1 ‘yes’. As suggested by the gloss, the negative particle kona can beused as the answer to polar questions and, also, it can negate phrasal expressions. This, however,is only part of the syntactic functions of polarity particles. The negative particle can be usedmore than as an answer to polar questions, and its functions and scope are described in detail inthe context of simplex clauses in the chapter 8, in 8.7.",[402]
"       As the examples in (109a-b) indicate, the periphrastic negation particle kona(introduced in 6.7.3 as a negative polarity particle) can precede or follow a pre-verbalconstituent:
        S NEG V-o
 109a. nota kona sa-ru
      1SG not go-3M.O
      ‘I’m not going there.’                                                 531
          NEG S         V-o
       b. kona nota sa-ru
          not 1SG go-3M.O
          ‘I’m not going there.’          NEG V-o
       c. kona hareka-ru
          not be.good
          ‘It’s not good’           NEG V-o
       d. ??hareka-ru kona
           be.good      not
           ??‘It’s not good’
As can be seen from (109c), kona is also the form used in sentences with descriptivepredicates. The example given in (109d), is preceded by question markers to illustratethe fact that I have no attested instance of a negative particle occurring post-verbally.","[562, 563]"

8.7. Negation       Two basic types of negative forms can be found in the language, namelyperiphrastic negation and morphological negation. These types of negation arepresented here in terms of forms rather than scope because it is not the aim of this section                                                530
to present an in-depth description of negation in terms of its scope. Also, for the mostpart, the sentence versus constituent scope of negation (Keenan 1964, Payne 1985)follows from their periphrastic and morphological form, respectively. In Pickering 1978the author presents a description specifically on negation in Apurinã, where he applies thetraditional tests for determining the scope of negation and the classification therebyreached. Morphological negation is marked with the negative attributive marker m(a)-(described in 5.3.2), yielding an objective descriptive verb. The example in (108)illustrates m(a)- in a verb that also takes the negative relative marker -katu in a relativeclause (described in detail in the next chapter, in the subsection 9.1.1.1.4):
        O            NEG-V-REL.NEG.o             V
 108. kuki-nhi        m-areka-kati-nhi       upũpe
     man-AFFECT NEG-be.good-REL.NEG.M-AFFECT die
     ‘The man who is bad died.’
     Lit.: ‘The man who is “non-good” died.’
       Thus, the Apurinã negative morphological marker is comparable to the Englishnegative prefixes un- (as in undo, uneasy, unborn etc.), iC- (as in impossible, illogicaletc.), and non- (as in non-existent, non-sense, etc.), except that m(a)- is restricted to thesubclass of objective descriptive intransitive verbs. See 5.3.2 for more on m(a)-.","[561, 562]"
"9.1.1.1.1      The Relative Pronominal Markers       The relative pronominal markers/forms correspond, morphologically, to therelativizing markers mentioned in 4.4.6, and they attach to the verb in a ClREL. Thewhole set of relativizers (to be revised in 9.1.1.5) was given in chapter 4, under 4.4.6, andis repeated for convenience in Table 1:

       The question marks in Table 1 are used to mark the forms whose existence I amstill uncertain of, as will be made explicit in the subsections where they are respectivelydescribed. Except for the forms having a question mark, all other relative pronominalmarkers in the language have been clearly attested. As suggested by the informationsummarized in Table 1, the relative pronominal markers form a rich system for codingvarious piece of information about the relative clause and its components: i.e. thegrammatical relation of the headREL in the relative clause, as well as its gender andnumber; the (positive/negative) polarity of the verb; the “actorlessness” of the verb; and asort of hierarchical role of the participants when expressed as pronominal forms.",[595]
"8.8.2.1          Polar (Yes/No) Questions            Polar questions are used to seek “a comment on the degree of truth of thequestioned proposition” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:179), normally elicit as answers thepositive or negative polarity particles aru ‘yes’ or kona ‘no’ (described in 6.7.3), and areonly marked prosodically by the rising intonation. This conventionalized use of risingintonation to mark polar questions can, nevertheless, be characterized as agrammaticalized property of interrogative sentences. In (112), the first two examples(112a-b) illustrate polar questions for clauses with transitive verbs, and the two lastexamples (112c-d) illustrate polar questions for clauses with intransitive verbs. In all ofthese examples, the only element that distinguishes the interrogative clauses from theirdeclarative counterpart is the rising intonation:22          s-V-o                     O
     112a. p-oka-pe-ru            ãkiti?
          2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
          ‘Have you killed the jaguar yet?’

           2SG-shoot-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
           ‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’
22
     I have only recently attested that the speech variety of the Fortaleza village has the morphema –ta, used in the verb
     base to mark polar questions. The equivalent of the sentence in (112b) in this speech community will be
     pi-keta-ta-ru ãkiti ‘Did you shoot the jaguar?’. This same morpheme is not present in the speech of the Japiim
     village.",[567]

        One particularity about the positive polarity marker, aru1 ‘yes’, which must be noticed isthat it is the only one (among all particles) that can take the suffix -te ‘really, indeed’, as inaru1-te ‘yes indeed; of course’. Thus, in this respect, aru1 differs from other particles. Polarityparticles are treated here separately from the discourse particles described next because, althoughthey may be used under particular discourse contexts with functions that can only be described interms of discourse-pragmatic factors, they have a well established prototypical function, namelyto mark the polarity of an event/state or of one of its parts. Aside from that, there is at least onehomophonous form, aru2, whose specific function is to serve as a sort of discourse link, thuswithout the meaning associated with a polarity particle.","[402, 403]"
"       The relativizing markers constitute the most complex grammatical category foundin the language as far as their morphological, syntactic and functional properties areconcerned. Table 33 summarizes (preliminarily) the whole system, ignoring for themoment their breaking down into smaller meaningful units: (PRON=independentpronoun, BPRO=Bound Pronominal Marker)                                                 245

       As seen in Table 33, the use of this relativizing system is determined by(morpho)syntactic properties such as grammatical relations, polarity, number, gender,and, perhaps, person hierarchy. A full description of the relativizing markers cannot bepresented before the sentence structure is described; for this reason, the detailed analysisof relativizing markers will be delayed until chapter 9, where complex sentences are alsodescribed. I can, however, already anticipate that, different from the other nominal formspresented above, the forms taking relativizing markers cannot be straightforwardlydefined as nouns (and, as we will see in chapter 9, they cannot be straightforwardlydefined as verbs either). One sort of morphological evidence for arguing that the formstaking relativizing markers are nouns is that they can take oblique markers (describedlater under 7.1.2 as a property of (pro)nouns). So, in (89) the form taking the feminineobject relative marker -kuto is followed by the goal oblique marker -mokaru (describedlater under 7.1.2.4):
 89. anhi-kuto-mokaru                                                ‘to the one taken away
     take.out-REL.SG.F.O-GOAL                                        (e.g. kidnapped one)’
However, as we will see in the discussion on relative clauses in chapter 9, there are goodreasons to argue that relativized forms share both a subset of nominal as well as a subset
                                                   246
of verbal properties. Under an analysis of the forms taking relativizing marker as nouns,the simplest word formation rules for these relativized forms would be as follows:
90. NSt → V + RELZ
       As happens to V+iko and, perhaps, to noun forms containing -muna, V+RELZforms are NOT sensitive to the alienable-inalienable distinction insofar as no formalmarking is required for them to occur possessed or unpossessed. Detailed illustrations ofconstrunctions with V+RELZ will be reserved for chapter 9.","[276, 277, 278]"

       When these tripartite morphemic clusters are contrasted to the way languagesgenerally mark ClRELs, they are found to be somewhat comparable to the relativepronouns commonly found in European languages (Keenan 1985:149-152, Comrie1989: 149-150, Givón 1990:656-658). Similar to relative pronouns, relative pronominalmarkers in Apurinã occur inside the ClREL indicating the role of the headREL, andfunctioning as subordinators. So, for example, the pairs -k-a-r-u/r-o vs. -k-u-t-u/t-o, inApurinã, and who vs. whom, in English, are both relative pronominal forms that occurinside the ClREL, marking the headREL as subject and object respectively. The differences
                                                 592
between these two pairs are in their phonological status (as bound vs. free forms), in thenumber of functional properties they encode (i.e. grammatical relation, voice, polarity,number and gender in Apurinã vs. grammatical relation and animacy in English), in theirposition inside the ClREL (i.e. following the verb in Apurinã vs. initial in the ClREL inEnglish), and, finally, in that only the Apurinã forms can also mark headless ClRELs.","[623, 624]"
"      Finally, some of the verb forms listed in the Table 2 are the positive values of aproperty; for these verbs, their negative values (i.e. their antonyms) are expressed as anegation of the positive value. So, for example, the opposite of the verb hareka ‘begood’ is kona hareka ‘be bad (not be good)’.",[315]
"
5.3.2 Negative Attributive (or Privative) Markers: m(a)-…and …-tu/-to          The negative attributive (hereafter privative) markers, i.e. m(a)-… and…-tu/-to, are morphemes that attach to nominal or descriptive verb bases to indicate thatthe notional subject of the resulting descriptive verb lacks the property borne by thelexical base the affix attaches to. A privative marker, thus, has the oppositefunction/meaning of the (positive) attributive markers. The privative marker is realizedas ma- before a consonant and as m- before a vowel.14 The presence of the privativemarker m(a)- triggers a morphologically conditioned allomorphy on third person objectmarkers, such that the third person masculine and feminine object markers, i.e. -ru and-ro, change into -tu and -to respectively. In the next examples, m(a)- attaches todescriptive verb bases in (84a-b), and to inalienable noun bases in (84c-d), and in all
   out that the same roots illustrated here are treated as free roots in the speech variety of the Fortaleza village (Marahã
   area); that is, the examples in (82) are all grammatical for speakers of the Fortaleza village.
14
   I have, however, found at least one speaker in the Japiim village who only produces the ma- form as the privative
   marker.",[368]

9.1.1.1.4      Relative Clauses and the Polarity of the Verb       In order to illustrate the polarity agreement, we can compare the examples in (7)and (10) with the following examples in (15). The first difference to note is the additionof the privative marker ma- to the verb. As shown in 5.3.1, ma- is a negation marker thatforms descriptive verbs. When the example in (15a) is compared with (7), it becomesclear that the relative pronominal marker changes its form to agree with the negativemarker ma-. The comparison can also be made between (10) and (15b) to produce the
                                               570
same analytical result. The way the relative pronominal marker changes is by alternatingbetween the polarity markers -r and -t, where the first marks positive and the latter marksnegative polarities:
      S/S      [neg-V-rel.s           ]                  V

    ‘The man who does not snore woke up.’
    Lit.: ‘The man who is a non-snorer woke up.’
       Notice that, although polarity markers are restricted to descriptive verbs (i.e.intransitive verbs that take object rather than subject pronominal markers), subject but notobject relative pronominal markers inflect for polarity. This is unexpected, sincedescriptive verbs take object rather than subject pronominal markers.","[601, 602]"
"
8.1.1 The Structure of Noun Phrases       Noun phrases are nominal constructions that can be structurally motivated on thebasis of negative/positive evidence from both the replacement and movement tests. NPscan be divided into oblique or caseless noun phrases on the basis of whether they take anoblique marker or not. The oblique markers were morphologically described in the                                                448
previous chapter, in 7.1.1 (and the syntactic function of the (pro)nominal expressionswhere they occur will be further discussed in the next chapter, in 8.2-3). The firstsubsection, below will describe caseless nouns phrases, whereas the second subsectionwill describe oblique noun phrases.","[479, 480]"
"
       The following example is given to show that the relative pronominal marker ofactorless passive ClRELs also inflects for gender. In (22) the headREL is serepi-txi ‘arrow’,an inherently feminine noun, and, as a result, the masculine relative pronominal marker-koru gives place to -koro in the verb. And, the example in (23) shows that this samerelative pronominal marker inflects for (negative/positive) polarity as well. In (23) thenegative marker is attached to the verb and, as result, the positive relative marker -korogives place to -koto:
      s-V-o              O/S            [ V-rel.pass ]ClREL

       In addition to the attested forms, Table 1 also gives the putative form for theplural form of the actorless passive relative pronominal marker, ??-konu, that could bearrived at by internal reconstruction, on the basis of its singular counterparts. This formhas not been attested in modern Apurinã and, thus, may never have existed at all.",[608]
"            As already mentioned in 6.7.3, kona is also the form normally used as the shortest(linguistic) answer to a polar question, in the role of counterpart of the positive polarityparticle aru. Furthermore, in some speech varieties (for example, the one spoken in thenorthern-most village, i.e. Jatuarana) the negative can undergo extreme phonologicalshortening. As shown in (110), kona can be shortened to /a/ before a consonant-initialword or to /n/ before a vowel-initial word:20
      NEG#s-V
 110a. a#n-ayata-panhi
      NEG#hunt-IMPFTV
      ‘I’m not going to go hunt.’
20
     In these speech varieties, sometimes kona is reduced to just nasalization in fast speech rates.",[563]
"There are reasons to say that the latter alternative better describes iye. That is, it would appearthat the discourse particle iye is already a lexically distinct word. The main evidence for this isthe fact that iye but not *oye (the feminine demonstrative counterpart) can be used as a discourseparticle. Similar reasoning applies to aru2 in relation to the positive polarity marker aru1.",[404]
"            Finally, I should note that further investigation needs to be done with respect tothe details of the scope properties of this periphrastic negative form and its place in thesentence structure.",[564]

5.3.3 Privative Reversal Marker: wẽ-        The privative reversal wẽ- is a morpheme that with a somewhat elusive function,especially because it is rarely used. The few examples so far attested suggest that itcancels/reverses the negative meaning of the descriptive verb forms it attaches to. This isillustrated in (85), where in (a-b) the morpheme cancels the negative meaning of thedeprivative marker, and in (c-d) where it cancels the meaning of the independent negativeparticle:

The structure of a descriptiveverb can be represented as in (86), although certain combinations do not occur due tosemantic incompatibility:
86. ATTR/PRIV-REV-Rt
5.4. General Syntactic Properties of Verbs       A verb in Apurinã can be distinguished from nouns as well as from other parts ofspeech in terms of various syntactic and morphological properties which are specific toverbs. The morphological distinctions between nouns and verbs, for example, consist ofthe inherently nominal or verbal morphological structures described in chapter 4 (fornouns) and in the previous sections for verbs. The remaining morphological structures ofverbs and nouns (not described in this or in the previous chapter) are the special boundformatives that either are NOT inherently verbal or nominal, respectively, or they interactin special ways with clausal or phrasal structures. These special bound formatives will bedescribed in detail in the next chapter.","[369, 370]"

       The example in (32) is illustrative of a headless ClREL where the negative form ofthe subject relative pronominal marker is used. The headless ClREL is ma-ãreka-kat-inhi‘the one who is not bad’, and the subject is encoded solely by the negative relativesubject pronominal marker -katu:

       First and foremost I wish to thank all of the Popũkaruwakoru people who adoptedand cared for me while I was in the field, and who taught me their language. Amongthem I thank most especially to the two Mipa Xirĩkaya, to Itaruru, Mainharu, Tokatxi,Kasãtomaro, Mokato, Koyoru, Matu, Kaneepa, Oyaka, Xirikoyaro, Powami,Bernaldinho, Artur, Pedrinho, Conceição, Chico Preto, Catuta, Antonio Apurinã, and somany others. Special thanks go also to Matthew Dryer for guiding me through theprocess of writing the dissertation, helping me to learn what I knew and what I stillneeded to know about Apurinã and about linguistics. My thanks also to the other readersof the dissertation, Karin Michelson and Wolfgang Wölck for all of their comments,suggestions and critiques, and to Sasha (Alexandra Aikhenvald) for making me come toterms with other Arawak languages. Most special thanks to my parents and to Kade fortheir love, care and trust. I thank all the professors of the linguistic departments ofSUNY-Buffalo and of the University of Oregon who in different times taught medifferent ways of doing linguistics; among them I thank especially Colette Grinevald,who first taught me how to go about writing a grammatical description. Late thanks go toSarah Lichtenstein, who for some years shared with me certain critical views that need tobe taken into account no matter what. Thanks to Denny Moore, who supported my earlywork in important ways. Finally I thank the friends and colleagues who made graduateschool easier and pleasant, and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico eTecnológico (CNPq), Inter-American Foundation, World Wildlife Fund, and Wenner-Gren Foundation for the financial support during part of my graduate studies.

            AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF       Sidney da S. Facundes     for the degree of     Doctor of Philosophy       in the Department of Linguistics to be taken January 2000               Title: THE LANGUAGE OF THE APURINÃ PEOPLE OF BRAZIL       (MAIPURE/ARAWAK)       A somewhat typologically informed grammatical description of the Apurinãlanguage is provided, including historical, socio-cultural, demographic and geographicinformation about the Apurinã society. The Apurinã communities spread alongtributaries of the Purus River, in western Brazilian Amazon. The grammatical analysisconsists of the phonology, morphology and syntax, with appendixes on languagevariation and the design of the Apurinã ortography, a text sample, a vocabulary list, and apreliminary reconstruction of Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari. The grammatical analysis isbased on language internal factors, though with some typological observations on majoraspects. The segmental phonology is simple; morphophonemic alternations are restrictedto pronominal subject/possessor markers and a few other bound morphemes. Stress ispredictably penultimate, though with exceptions that need further investigation.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"        Some meanings that are associated with adverbs in European languages (insofar as theyrefer to the intensity of an event/state, the degree to which or the manner in which it takes place)are expressed by bound forms in the verb in Apurinã. Examples of these are –ka‘INTENSIFIER’, -wari ‘almost’, and -ãpo ‘RANDOM’ (described under 5.2.1.1). Otheradverb-like meanings are expressed as verbal constructions, such that, in terms of theirtranslation equivalents, instead of saying ‘He runs rapidly.’ one would say ‘He’s fast.’        Other semantically adverb-like particles include a pair of spatial forms used with deicticfunctions. Analogous to the demonstratives, these spatial adverbial forms can be distal, i.e. farfrom the speaker (or other deictic center), or proximate, i.e. close to the speaker/hearer (or otherdeictic center), as listed in the following Table 7:
                                Table 7: Adverbial Spatial Particles                                    Forms                    Gloss
                                     wai                     ‘here’
                                     werã                    ‘there’                                                       369
The examples in (33) illustrate the use of distal and proximate adverbial particles:
 33a. n-awa-ru       wai
     1SG-exist-3M.O here
     ‘I live here.’    b. nu-sa-ru        werã
      1SG-go-3M.O there
      ‘He went there.’
       One important information related to the approximate adverbial particle wai is that thereis a phonologically identical form that can be used as a descriptive verb. So, the conventionalway to greet a person when visiting an Apurinã village is by uttering (34a), for which (34b) is theconventional answer:
 34a. wai-ka-i             pite
     be.here-PRED-2O 2SG
     ‘Hi there…!’
     Lit.: ‘Are you here?’    b. wai-ka-ra-no                 nota
       be.here-PRED-FOC-2O 1SG
       ‘Hi, I’m here!’
       Lit.: ‘It’s here that I am!’
Both in (34a) and (34b) the form wai is used as a descriptive objective verb which takes theobject pronominal marker to express its notional subject. There are two possible analyses ofthese examples as far as the form wai is concerned. The basic question is whether the proximateadverbial particle and the object descriptive verb are different words or whether they actually arethe same word, namely a proximate adverbial particle that can be used (as other words can) asthe predicate of a “verbless” clause. In this work I will treat wai used in an object descriptivepredicate as a descriptive objective verb, and wai used with an adverbial-like function as an                                                    370
adverbial particle. It is conceivable, however, that this is ultimately a purely terminologicalissue.","[400, 401, 402]"
"Conceivably, in discontinuous dependencies two forms may work together to encode alexical meaning or grammatical function without necessarily constituting a singlemorpheme. (E.g., the verb plus particle combinations in English, as in call him up.)
3.5.2      Other Special Types of Bound Formatives        Apart from the forms that behave as typical affixes in the language, there are variousbound formatives that show a behavior distinct from typical affixes in the following ways:They occur outside of typical affixes, some of them “float” in the clause, and they tend tointeract in special ways with syntactic phenomena. The special bound formatives that occurwith different word classes can be illustrated by the associative oblique marker -kata, as innota-kata ‘with me’, ata-kata ‘with us’, unawa-kata ‘with them’ etc.",[169]
"Moreover, such a definition of the Apurinã sentence will partly match the (perhaps) mostoften cited general definitions of “sentence” found in the linguistic literature, such as theones represented by (3-8):
3. “The sentence is considered here not as a unit consisting of a predicate and nounsrelated to it (a simple clause), but rather as a combination of such units (clauses) into stilllarger structures of a sort here summarized.” (Longacre 1985:235)4. “The sentence is the largest unit of grammatical description.” (Bloomfield, aspresented in Lyons 1968:172)5. “As a grammatical unit, the sentence is an abstract entity in terms of which the linguistaccounts for the distributional relations holding within utterances.” (1968:176)6. “[T]he sentence in turn can be defined as the maximal unit of syntax, or the largestunit over which constructional relations hold.” (Matthews 1981:29)7. The sentence is “[t]he largest unit in terms of which the grammar of a language isorganized.” (Crystal 1992:349)
                                                 445
8. “In generative grammar, [the sentence is] the syntactic category which is taken as thelargest category capable of syntactic characterization, all of its component parts beingbound together by rules of syntax and its entire structure being well-formed.” (Trask1992:250-251)
            However, one should also bear in mind that there are perhaps as many putativecrosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” as the number of different syntactic theories.","[476, 477]"
"Although a preliminary analysis of prosodic structures is suggested, more work isrequired in this area. The morphology is complex and includes special bound formswhich are partially distinguishable from typical affixes. Nouns and verbs are clearly
                                               xxvii
distinct syntactic categories; however, property-referring words are describable as asubclass of intransitive verbs. Classificatory nouns are used as part of productive nouncompounding and a subset of them can be verb-incorporated and refer back to physicaland shape properties of participants previously mentioned in the discourse —in this wayresembling verb incorporated classifiers of North American languages. The descriptionof the syntactic organization of the language involves, to a great extent, examining thefunctions and behavior of bound morphemes, and reaches its highest complexity in thesystem of relative clauses. A subset of property-referring words, called objectivedescriptive verbs, presents a morphologically marked split intransitivity system which ispartly based on the semantic class of these verbs. Such a system is typical of Arawaklanguages. The constituent order is semi-free; the VO order is the most frequent in texts,but the patterns of word order correlations point to OV. Overal, the Apurinã languageconstitutes a laboratory for examining the interplay between morphological forms andsyntactic structure and functions, providing certain grammatical and semantic categoriesand structures that resemble only in part those attested in other languages.

Finally, the fourth column (and sub-columns under Gender) liststhe morphemes for masculine and feminine. Notice also that, as is made explicit in thetable below, the major distinctions in the types of ClRELs can be described in terms ofdistinctions of GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, and Gender, thus producing tripartitemorphemic clusters. That is, at the same time that relative pronominal markers aresegmentable into three morphological markers (GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, andGender), they also cluster together to function as relativizers.","[622, 623]"

7.1.14.     Future Marking: -ko        The future marker -ko refers to the non-immediate future tense of the verb, but itcan, however, occur attached to noun bases, pronoun bases, numeral bases, and particlebases, in addition to verb bases, thus constituting another example of a formative whosescope is not necessarily the word it attaches to. I will return to discuss this marker inchapter 8, in 8.6.1.1, where tense will be described in clausal context. The followingexamples in (42) are illustrative of it:
 42a. katarokuru-nanu-ra-ko
       manioc.flour-RESTR-FOC-FUT
       ‘(It’s) only manioc flour (that) will...’    b. maku-putu-ka4-ra-ko
       Brazil.nut-EMPH-PRED-FUT
       ‘(It’s) broken buckets (that) will...’    c. kopiti-ka4-ra-ko               o-kama
        bucket-PRED-FOC-FUT 3F-make
        ‘(It’s) the bucket that she’ll make.’    d. nota-ko suka-ru

        ‘I won’t give you banana.’
(42a-c) show the future marker attached to noun bases; (42d) shows the future markerwith a pronoun base; (42e) shows the future marker with a numeral base; and, (42f)shows the marker with a negative particle.","[440, 441]"

"The fact that this bound morpheme has been only found in elicited speech may suggestthat it is being left out of the language in more contemporaneous speech varieties. -pokawas described by Pickering as marking a “polite command”. The way they are used nowis more as commands, as the following examples illustrate:
 123a. ĩporãã p-apa-poka     watxa
       water 2SG-fetch-IMPER now
      ‘Go get water now.’    b. p-umaka-poka
       2SG-sleep-IMPER
       ‘Go sleep.’
       Other than examples such as these above, commands, orders etc. take noadditional marking forms. Instead, they lack a subject expressed by an independent NP;their subject is expressed solely by the bound pronominal form for the second personsingular subject. In the following examples in (124), the sentences can be uttered ascommand in (124a), a request in (124b) (repeated from (74)), and a warning in (124c):
                                               542
 124a. xamuna pu-taka xãã-poki-ã
      firewood 2SG-put flame-border-INSTR
      ‘Put firewood in the fire.’    b. ĩporãã pu-suka-no
       water 2SG-give-1SG.O
       ‘Bring me water.’    c. tsora! pu-muteka!
       Tsora 2SG-run
       ‘Tsora! Run!’
8.8.3.1      Hortative Speech Act          Hortative sentences can be considered the subtype of imperative speech actwhere “the speaker is encouraging or inciting someone to action” (Bybee et al 1994:179),thus different from commands, orders, instructions and the like. Hortative sentences aremarked with the clause-initial (h)amo ‘HORTATIVE’ particle already mentioned inchapter 6. (h)amo is found in clauses about inviting someone to go somewhere, dosomething (e.g. eat, dance, etc.) and so on. Aside from occurring only clause initially,another restriction of this hortative marker is that it can only be used with first personplural, as the following examples illustrate:
 125a. hamo a-su-pe
      HORT 1PL-go-PFTV
      ‘Let’ get going.’    b. hamo a-nhipoko-ta
       HORT 1PL-eat-VBLZ
       ‘Let’s eat.’
                                                 543

       HORT 1PL-dance
       ‘Let’s eat.’       HORT [s-V-o              O ]
    d. hamo [a-kama-ro         ããta ]
       HORT 1Pl-make-3M.O canoe
       ‘Let’s build a canoe”.’8.9. Summary: Evidence for Subject-ObjectDistinctions       The notions of grammatical subject and grammatical object can be motivated onthe basis of various ways that the syntactic expressions of notional subject and notionalobject behave in the clause, as summarized in Table 1. The distinct marking orbehavioral properties that the syntactic expressions of subject and object have in the sameset of clauses characterize a syntactic distinction between the two.","[573, 574, 575]"

Masculine and feminine gender can be marked morphologicallyor they can be morphologically unmarked. Unmarked masculine/feminine gender is theone for which no formal grammatical marker is added to the verb. There are variousways to tell the gender of an unmarked noun form in natural discourse, all involving acoreferential formative found in the modifier, determiner or in the predicate. This isillustrated in the following examples in (64a) and (64b), where in the first clause tata‘“umari”’ cross-references the feminine pronominal object form in the verb, whereas inthe second clause yowata ‘knife’ cross-references the masculine pronominal object formin the verb:
                                                218
64a. ata nhika-ro tata
     we eat-3F.O umari
     ‘We eat “umari”.’     b. nota atama-ru      yowata
        I     look-3M.O knife
        ‘I saw the knife.’
           Different from languages such as Portuguese and French, Apurinã does not showcross-referencing between the elements inside nominal phrases, as the possessiveconstructions in (65) illustrate:20
65a. uwa       yowata-ne
     3SG.M knife-POSSED
     ‘his knife’     b. owa      yowata-ne
        3SG.F knife-POSSED
        ‘her knife’
           Nouns that are morphologically unmarked for gender constitute the majority ofthe Apurinã nominal lexicon. They include sex-non-differentiable nouns such as thoselisted in Table 27. As can be gathered from Table 27, the great majority ofmorphologically unmarked noun stems referring to sex-non-differentiable elements isassigned to the masculine gender.","[248, 249, 250]"
"The definition used here follows from the properties of the Apurinã grammar as well as(partly) from what implicitly or explicitly is found in some of those putativecrosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” (such as the ones given in 3-8). In the wayconceived here, the notion of “sentence”, as unit of syntax, is an abstract construct in away analogous to the way in which “phoneme”, as a unit of phonology, and “morpheme”,as unit of morphology, also are abstract constructs.1
8.1. The Structure of Phrases            The goal of this section is to motivate and describe the constituent structure ofclauses. In providing evidence for parts of speech as units involved in the organization ofclauses, by implication, I have also provided motivation for treating words as constituentsof the clause. What needs to be examined now is the extent to which words can combineinto larger constituents within a clause. There is no question that words constituteindividual constituents within the clause. So, for example, in the first of the three clausesin (9a), suto ‘woman’ occurs preceding the verb apo-pe ‘arrive-PFTV’. As shown by the1
    I have found particular useful the discussions in Lyons 1968:172-180 and Matthews 1981:ch.2 on the various
     definitions of “sentence”, where detailed references on the subject are also provided.",[477]

6.6 Interjections       Interjections are the word forms that are used with particular exclamatory purposes, likecalling somebody, screaming, expressing pain, surprise, or other sort of feelings. A systematicsurvey of exclamatory words in Apurinã still needs to be carried out, since gender and age(among other) factors seem to play a role in determining the use of such words. The examples in(29) illustrate some of these exclamatory words. As shown by (27c), some particles can also beused with exclamatory functions:
 29a. hei!                             ‘man answering a call’    b. oh!                             ‘woman answering a call’    c. ha!                             ‘initiating story-telling’    d. ateeneka!                       ‘Right!’    e. ne-putu-ka-ru!                  ‘True, indeed!’

                                 Complex Sentences
9.0. Introduction        The purpose of this chapter is to describe the ways that two or more clauses cancombine to form a complex sentence, that is, a sentence with more than one predicate,and the way that sentences can be juxtaposed. The following diagram summarizes thetypes of complex sentences and sentence juxtaposition described in this chapter:                                          Complex Sentences1.

9.1. Subordination        Subordination is here defined as the process by which a complex sentence isformed out of two (or more) clauses, wherein one of the clauses (the subordinate one)                                                  560
“function[s] as noun phrases, as modifiers of nouns, and as modifiers of verb phrases orentire propositions.” (Longacre 1985:237). Three types of subordination can bedistinguished: relatives, complements and adverbials.","[590, 591, 592]"

8.1.2 Verb and the Object NP       Now that the structure of NP(obl)s have been motivated and their structuredescribed, it is worth inquiring whether there is any way that the verb plus the object NPconstitute a separate phrasal constituent, different from NP(obl)s. At the present time thereis no convincing positive evidence to argue that a verb plus the object NP form a phrasalunit similar to, for example, the verb phrase (hereafter VP) in English or in otherlanguages where such a constituent can be motivated. The closest thing we can find to areplacement test would consist of the replacement of the verb plus the NP objectconstruction by the verbal form txa described under 5.11.4. So, in (37a) suto ‘woman’ isa NP subject of the clause, and nhika-ru nhipoko-ru1 ‘ate food’ is the predication aboutthe subject. In (37b) we see that the whole predication about the subject can be replacedwith the form txa-ru ‘do-3M.O’:
 37a. suto   [nhika-ru [nhipoko-ru]NP ]?
      woman eat-3M.O food-UNPOSS
     ‘The woman ate food.’   b. o-[txa-ru]
      3F-do-3M.O
      ‘She did it.’
The use of txa-ru to replace an intransitive verb or a transitive verb plus its NP object iscommon in the language. This particular use of txa-ru may be what led Aberdour(1985:46) to label txa a “summary verb”, since in a way it sort of “summarizes” themeaning of a predication previously expressed in the discourse. To the extent that txa is                                                 462
used anaphorically to express the meaning of a previous predicate, it could be argued toserve as evidence, on the basis of the replacement test, for treating the verb plus NPobject construction as a VP. In the next example in (38), however, we see that the NPexpressing the notional object nhipokoru, that seemed to be internal to the predication in(37a), occurs clause initially, without the addition of any phonological pause:
 38. [nhipoko-ru]NP suto   nhika
     food-UNPOSS woman eat
     ‘The woman ate food.’
The fact that the verb and the NP object can be separated by the NP subject needs to beexplained in order to maintain a VP analysis. It is possible that the clause initial NPobject illustrated in (38) is restricted to clauses that are somehow marked (structurallyand/or pragmatically) and derivable from clausal structures such as that represented by(37a). However, such a markedness would still need to be established in the language.","[493, 494]"
"       Perhaps to compensate for the simplicity of the phonological system of thelanguage, its morphology is extremely rich. Bound morphemes abound in the language,especially in the verb, with a great variety of functions. Due to this typologicalcharacteristic of this language with respect to its morphological system, five chapters (3-                                                 613
7) were spent describing, respectively, a general introduction to morphology, the nounmorphology, verb morphology, closed word class morphology, and special boundmorphology. It is this richness in morphological forms and their specific functions thatgive Apurinã characteristics associated with so-called polysynthetic languages. Nounsand verbs can be independently motivated as distinct parts-of-speech on morphological aswell as syntactic grounds. Adverbial and adjectival meanings, on the other hand, havetheir typical functions expressed by means of bound morphemes or particles, in the firstcase, and, in the second case, by bound morphemes, classificatory nouns and descriptiveverbs. Special bound morphemes are less than typical affix forms that can be classifiedas floating, quasi-floating, or non-floating in terms of whether they occur with differentword categories or not. Aside from the floating characteristics of bound morphemes theyshow the common property of occurring as the “outer”-most layers of bound morphemesin their word bases. Moreover, some of them interact in special ways with syntacticphenomena as, for example, the complementary distribution that is found betweensubject/object pronominal markers and coreferential pre-verbal subject/objectexpressions, or subject/possessor markers and free coreferential possessor expressions.","[644, 645]"
"Finally, I will return to some of the closed classes or words in chapters 8-9, where the syntax ofsimplex sentences is described. As happens in various other places in this work, certain wordproperties can be better described within the specific domains of the grammar that theseproperties are most relevant to. This applies most clearly to the interrogative words and to themajority of the particles introduced above. In fact, even more than syntactic structures, discourseparticles require information about the organization of the Apurinã discourse structure in order tobe properly described. Since this work does not include a description of discourse structures,discourse particles cannot (unfortunately) be satisfactorily described here.",[406]
"Payne, John. 1985. Negation. In Shopen 1985.2:197-242.",[702]
"            Functions usually associated with adverbs in other languages are accomplished inApurinã either by adverbial particles (as will be shown in 6.3.1) or bound markers in theverb. As we see in the next chapter, there are good reasons to treat these independentwords with adverbial functions as a subclass of particles rather than as an independentclass of adverbs. Not only is the case that the class of independent words used withadverbial functions is rather small but, also, there is no morphological way to derive aword with an adverbial function from another word.",[375]
"
6.7.4 Discourse Particles        Discourse particles are various word forms that are normally used to link differentdiscourse chunks. The precise function of these forms cannot be described without a detailedunderstanding of the language discourse structures, which is beyond the scope of the presentwork. In Table 8 a sample of the discourse particles is listed:

"5.1.1.2.2      Potentially Ditransitive Verbs       Verbs that translate as ditransitive (i.e. trivalent) verbs in other languages behavelike regular transitive verbs in Apurinã insofar as only the subject and one object arestructurally required to occur, and the third argument is structurally optional (i.e. the thirdargument can be omitted without making the clause ungrammatical). The examples in(17) illustrate the general case, namely that verbs that translate as ditransitive verbs insome other languages, in this case as ‘to teach’ and as ‘to tell’ in English, behave asregular transitive verbs in Apurinã (parentheses indicate that the expression is structurallyoptional in the clause in which it occurs):
 17a. mipake owara-pira-ta-ru          u-sãkire (pita-monhi)
      Mipake teach-language-3M.O 3M-language.of 2SG-GOAL
      ‘Mipake taught his language (to you).’   b. nota sãpire-ta-ru           tsora sãkire (youkake-monhi)
      1SG tell-VBLZ-3M.O Tsora language.of Youkake-GOAL
      ‘I told the Tsora story (to Youkake).’As shown in (17), the argument expressing the “theme” is obligatory and occurs as theobject of the verb, expressed by a “caseless” noun phrase, while the recipient argument isoptionally expressed by an “oblique” noun phrase. For the present purposes of thissection, a “caseless” noun phrase can be informally defined as a noun phrase without anymorphological case marker, whereas an “oblique” noun phrase can be described (alsoinformally) as a noun phrase marked with an oblique (case) marker. The description ofnoun phrases will take place under 9.3.",[318]
"        The second special property of suka is that, while regular transitive verbs take asingle caseless object noun phrase, with suka either the “theme” argument, represented bya “caseless” noun phrase, or the recipient argument, expressed by an oblique noun phrase,can bear the object grammatical relation, as indicated by what the object pronominalmarker agrees with, as the examples in (19) illustrate:
 19a. o-suka-ro     uwa-mokaru    nu-serepi
      3F-give-3F.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
      ‘She gave my arrow to him.’
                                                  288
   b. nota suka-ru      uwa-mokaru nu-serepi
      1SG give-3M.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
     ‘I gave my arrow to him.’
In (19a), the verb bears a feminine object pronominal marker, agreeing with the caselessnoun phrase representing the “theme” argument nu-serepi ‘my arrow’. In (19b), incontrast, the verb bears a masculine pronominal marker, agreeing with the recipientobject, which is expressed by the oblique noun phrase uwa-mokaru ‘to him’(morphologically described in chapter 7, 7.1.2.4). That is, insofar as pronominal objectmarkers can be considered to be the major formal marking property of the objectgrammatical relation in Apurinã, the object of the ditransitive verb suka can be expressedeither by the caseless noun phrase representing the “theme” or by the oblique (orcaseless) noun phrase expressing the recipient. In the interest of focusing here on theproperties that regular transitive and ditransitive verbs share or do not share, I willpostpone to chapter 8 (in subsection 8.1.1.2, where the relevant type of grammaticalrelations will be presented) further discussion on what it means for the recipient or the“theme” semantic role to be marked as object in the language. General constraints on thestructure of clauses with potentially ditransitive verbs will be discussed in 8.3.","[319, 320]"

8.3.1 Core Grammatical Relations       Core grammatical relations have been defined above both in terms of generallytaking the form of a NP to express arguments of a verb, as well as in terms of expressingarguments that are required by the lexical meaning of the verb. The latter part of thedefinition can be considered of greater importance, since, as will be seen later (8.3.1.2,8.3.2.4 and 8.3.2.5), there are two subclasses of oblique grammatical relations that can beencoded as NPs. There are two types of core grammatical relations that can bedistinguished on the basis of a cluster of properties associated with one but not the otherNPs expressing argument functions. These are referred to by the traditional labels(grammatical) subject and (grammatical) object. As will be seen later, in section 8.9,the distribution of clausal constituents in a sentence cannot be used as a defining criterionfor subject- and objecthood, since the position of such clausal constituents may vary inways that cannot be predicted on the basis of specific grammatical factors. That is, thereis enough variation in the order of clausal constituents so as to make it impossible to tellwhether a NP bears subject or object grammatical relation to the verb purely on the basisof its position in a sentence. The data on clausal constituent order variation will besystematically described in 8.9.","[501, 502]"
"        Finally, the distribution of subject and object NPs in simplex sentences cannot bepredicted on grammatical grounds. Further research is necessary in order to establishwhether/which specific discourse-pragmatic factors play any significant role in the“decision” of Apurinã speakers to use one or another of the clausal constituent ordersfound in the language. Nevertheless, it would appear that none of the clausal constituentorder types in the language can be argued to be more basic/neutral/unmarked than theother in any way other than in terms of rather theory-specific assumptions or principles,as will be shown in the next section.",[576]

8.6.1 Tense            The tense grammatical category can be understood as “[t]he grammaticalexpression of the time of a situation described in a proposition, relative to some othertime” (Crystal 1992:386). In a general sense, tense “locates the event in time” (Chungand Timberlake 1985:202). It is this deitic/indexical nature inherent to tense that isabsent in the aspect category (described in 8.6.2 below). On the basis of its formalmarking properties, tense can described in terms to two types in Apurinã: future andnon-future. These two types of tenses have as reference center the speech locus (i.e. themoment in which speech takes place).158.6.1.1          Future            The future tense in Apurinã refers to a non-immediate time frame in the future(in relation to the speech locus), and is marked with the class3 bound form -ko(morphologically described in 7.1.14). In (89a) the sentence expresses an imperativespeech act (described and defined in 8.8.3) where an advice is being given about thebehavior of the addressee in the time to come. In (89b) the sentence (extracted from afolk Apurinã story) is uttered in a context where the speaker just realizes he is beingfollowed by hunters after his kidnapping of a woman; in this case future is used to refer15
     The description of tense presented here is restricted to its use in simple sentences. Tense resolution in complex
     sentences is not included here.",[544]
"Rather, there was a stage when the word meant both A and B, and the earlier meaning ofA eventually was lost” (1991:9). In that view, -muna could be, conceivably, treated as aninstance of polysemy. Now, does this help us answer question I or II posited above?
                                                189
How can we show that each instance of -muna in words like ãã-muna ‘tree,’ aiko-muna‘house beam,’ kiri-muna ‘animal nose’ etc... corresponds to different word meanings thathappen to be expressed in the language by the same phonological form? If we followed astrict version of the polysemy view, we would end up having to accept a lexiconconsisting of lexical entries such as -muna1, -muna2, -muna3, -muna4, -muna5 etc... whichwhen applied to the other CN2s of the language would generate a close to infinite numberof lexical meanings the language learner would need to memorize. This certainly is not adesirable result. If on the other, we assume that there is enough similarities among thevarious uses of -muna that justifies to treat them as semantically related in some way, wefind ourselves in the position of having to show which “similarities” those are.","[220, 221]"

6.7 Particles        In addition to the pronominal and demonstrative forms presented above, there are otherclosed classes of words with various functions. These other forms are described in this sectionunder the umbrella particles. In a sense, particles are word classes that do not fit in any of theother word categories already established. In this sense the category “particles” does function asa sort of “wastebasket”. But, also, particles do pattern similarly insofar as they generally neitherhave any inherent morphology nor take any inherent nominal or inherent verbal morphology.","[397, 398]"
"       The language has characteristics of a head-marking type language in having, forinstance, cross-referencing markings on verbs and possession markers on the headpossessed noun. The rich morphology of this language does not at all imply the lack ofsyntactic operations; instead, it simply means that many grammatical functions areformally encoded in the morphosyntax, i.e. they are expressed by forms that partiallyobey morphological rules as to their distribution, but syntactic conventions as to their useand allocation in the clause. As to clausal constituent order, the language is
                                                52
predominantly OV in terms of its word order corelations, although the most frequentorder in text is VO. The language also has a gender system based on thefeminine-masculine grammatical distinction, a morphologically marked noun classsystem based on alienable versus inalienable possession, and an incipient nounclassification system consisting of nouns with classificatory functions that recur as part ofa productive noun compounding system.","[83, 84]"
"       To a great extent, the syntax of Apurinã consists of the functional or distributionalbehavior expressed by bound formatives. The notions of a grammatical subject and agrammatical object can be established partly on the basis of two paradigms of boundpronominal forms, one used for subject and the other for object grammatical relations,and the way these grammatical relations pattern in causative, reciprocal, reflexive andrelative constructions. Oblique grammatical relations are generally marked with oblique                                                615
markers that attach to (pro)nominal forms. A VP constituent cannot be easily motivatedon the basis of language internal evidence and empirical grounds. Inter-clausal relationscan be marked with a few subordinator forms, but such relations are more often (in termsof token as well as type sentences) expressed by juxtaposition —as is the case of sentenceconjoining.","[646, 647]"
"
7.1.7.      Predicate Marking: -ka4         The predicate marker -ka4 occurs attached to word bases that are used aspredicators. Such word bases include (at least) verb bases, noun bases, pronoun bases,numeral bases, and particle bases. With nouns, pronouns or particles, -ka4 functions asnon-verbal predicate marker, attaching to the head of such a non-verbal predicate                                               397
construction. The examples in (24) illustrate -ka4 with non-verbal predicateconstructions:
 24a. popũka-ru-ka4-ra-no
      Apurinã-F-PRED-FOC-1SG.O
      ‘I (really) am Apurinã.’   b. watxa-ka4-ra-ko
      ADV.PTC-PRED-FOC-FUT
      ‘(It) will really be today/now.’   c. hãt-u-ka4-ra-ko

      ‘(It) will be one.’   d. uwa-putu-ka4-ma-ra-ko
      3SG.M-EMPH-PRED-FRUSTR-FOC-FUT
      ‘(It) would be him but….’
       When attached to verb bases, -ka4 has no apparent grammatical meaning orfunction, working simply as an optional “filler” or empty formative. I call it “predicate”marker because it occurs with non-verbal bases when these are in predicate position.","[428, 429]"
"
1.6. Apurinã and Linguistic Typology       Apurinã has typical properties of a polysynthetic language insofar as it has a richsystem of grammatical functions expressed by means of bound morphemes —not onlythe functions typologically expressed by grammatical morphemes across many languagesbut also functions typologically expressed by lexical morphemes. Different, however,from many of the polysynthetic languages of North America, Apurinã is more of anagglutinative (rather than fusional) type language; the language has a (C)(V)V syllablestructure, and morphophonological alternations are basically restricted to proclitic-likepronominal markers and to a few other verb bound forms.",[83]
