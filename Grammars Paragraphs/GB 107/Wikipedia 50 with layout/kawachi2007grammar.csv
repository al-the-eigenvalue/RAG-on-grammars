"4.2.2.3.7 Negative Suffixes          Unlike the negative proclitic di= (Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.4), which occurs at thebeginning of a constituent in the focus position and is used to negate various types ofconstituents, the negative suffix -kki is always attached to the verb of a subordinateclause. Conversely, any subordinate clause has to be negated with this suffix.",[453]

   When used with hanni, such a verb can also be accompanied by the negative imperative suffix to
express the negative command, as in (i).(i)       hanni wajj-i-tooti.

"          The negative suffix -kki is used to negate the verb of a relative clause, as in(4.236) and (4.237). It immediately follows the verb and precedes the head of the relativeclause.(4.236)          hiito    c’oomm-i-t-anno-kki                           saale

          The suffix -kki is also used to negate the verb in a complement clause, as in(4.238) and (4.239). It occurs between the verb stem and the complementizer.(4.238)          mine-se                       hir-t-anno-kki=ta

          The negative suffix -kki also negates the verb in an adverbial clause, as in (4.240)-(4.244). This suffix is followed by the noun-phrase clitic =wa ‘place’ in (4.240), thesuffix -ro ‘if’ in (4.241), the suffix -ede ‘so that’ in (4.242), the suffix -wote ‘when’ in(4.243), and the suffix -daafira/-hura ‘because’ in (4.244).","[453, 454]"

specifically, at the beginning of y-/ass-. Examples are in (iii) and (iv).(iii)     tassi  di=ass-ø-ino-’e.

          to mean, ‘I am not satisfied.’Nevertheless, there are a few y- and ass- expressions where the preceding element and y-/ass- can be
contracted (e.g., sikk’i y- ~ sikk’- ‘to approach’, hayye ass- ~ hayyeess- ‘to sing a baby a lullaby’). The
negative proclitic di= precedes such contracted forms, as in (v), though it intervenes between their two

As in the above examples, expressions with y- and ass- areoften paired with each other and show contrast in causativity (y-versions: non-causativevs. ass-versions: causative), though there are a small number of y- expressions that haveno ass- counterparts (e.g., araji y- ‘to become bored’, leessi y- ‘to become dusk’). Thepreceding form usually ends in i, as in (3.191), and there are some expressions thatcontain reduplicated forms, as in (3.192). There are various meanings that such idiomaticexpressions with y- and ass- tend to convey: posture change, self-contained motion,emotion, etc., though such meanings do not necessarily require expressions with y- andass- to be used.","[195, 196, 197]"
Hetzron (1980) also suggests a possibility of the negative proclitic di= and the locationalnoun-phrase clitic =wa in the HEC languages as instances of the influence from Omoticlanguages.,[31]

          There are two idiomatic expressions in which a verb with -kki may be followed bya nominal suffix (V-PERSON-INF-kki-ra and V-S.PRF-kki-nni). First, when -kkinegates a verb with a combination of the person suffix and the infinitive suffix that isfollowed by the dative suffix -ra (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.4), the suffix occursimmediately before -ra, as in (4.247).

                 ‘She swore not to come.’
          Second, the suffix -kki can occur right before the ablative-instrumental suffix-nni. The verb is always in the simple perfect before -kki-nni, and the negative suffix-kki seems to nominalize the verb. An adverbial of this structure may be used with a verbof prevention as in (4.248), or may express manner as in (4.249).(4.248)          ub-b-u-kki-nni

          There is another negative suffix, -nke, which only attaches to a verb in the first-person plural imperative or the optative (section 4.2.2.3.5).(4.250)          i-n-t-o-nke

4.2.2.3.8 Subordinating Suffixes          There are several suffixes that can attach to a verb at the end of a subordinateclause. All of them except -ro ‘if’ and -hura ‘because’ can be preceded by parts ofspeech other than verbs to form adverbials.","[454, 455, 456, 457, 458]"
"       The framing event, which is the main event of a macro-event, constitutes theschematic core of the macro-event, and has a framing function relative to the macro-event. It “provides for the whole macro-event the overarching conceptual framework orreference frame within which the other included activities are conceived of as takingplace”, and represents “the upshot – relative to the whole macro-event” in the sense that“it is the framing event that is asserted in a positive declarative sentence, that is deniedunder negation, that is demanded in an imperative, and that is asked about in aninterrogative”; moreover, it determines the overall temporal and spatial frameworks, theargument structure, and the syntactic complement structure (Talmy 2000b: 219).",[711]

3.1.4 Adverbs           The class of lexical adverbs in Sidaama is small in size compared to other openclasses. Like adjectives, lexical adverbs that are not derived from other parts of speechare small in number. Examples are shown in (3.163). Many of them are time adverbs,which refer to temporal relations or points in time relative to the time of utterance or aparticular reference point.

                                    Cha pter 4 Morp hology         Sidaama is an agglutinative language, where almost all derivational morphologyand all inflectional morphology involves affixation. Most affixes are suffixes, thoughthere are case suprafixes (specifically, the accusative, oblique, and genitive casesuprafixes). There are no prefixes in this language (though the negative proclitic di=(Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.4) is often treated as a verb prefix rather than a clitic in theliterature; e.g., Teferra 2000). Reduplication is not uncommon in Sidaama, though notproductive.","[331, 332]"

       The negation test reveals the ambiguity of a sentence like (6.29) (repeated belowas (6.36)), which could be taken as an instance of the manner/concomitance constructionor the temporal inclusion construction. The main verb of (6.29) (e’- ‘to enter’) is negatedin (6.37). When (6.37) is interpreted as an instance of the manner/concomitanceconstruction, as in (6.37-1), the occurrences of the event components expressed by thetwo verbs are both negated. On the other hand, when (6.37) is interpreted as an instanceof the temporal inclusion construction, as in (6.37-2), only the occurrence of the eventcomponent expressed by V2 is negated.(6.36) kaase       min-i          iddo-ra

Nevertheless, a difference usually emerges in an alternative interpretationdepending on whether or not the V1 of this construction is a Manner verb. When V1expresses a Manner of the translational motion of the V2 in this construction, thenegation of V2 can often also be interpreted as resulting in the negation of only theManner, as shown in (6.38-2) and (6.39-2).10 On the other hand, when the V1 of the

However, it is not clear how the difference of the alternative interpretations due to thescope of negation is related to the single-clause-hood of the construction. Furthermore,there are cases where the above generalization does not work. For example, there arecases like (6.45) where the negation of V2 in a temporal sequence construction using amanner verb as V1 can have a scope over both verbs, or otherwise over V2, rather thanover V1.

"          The negation test, which is often employed in the literature (e.g., Noonan 1985,Kelly and Melinger eds. 2001: 86-97, Bohnemeyer et al. in press) to examine clause-hood, seems to be able to serve as a reliable diagnostic test for distinguishing themanner/concomitance and extended causation constructions from the temporal inclusionconstruction in Sidaama. The negation test determines whether two verbs in a multi-verbconstruction constitute a single clause or two clauses on the basis of the scope ofnegation, specifically, whether or not the negation of the main verb has scope over theoccurrence of both of the event components that the two verbs express.",[732]

                  i.       RC=hu di=...=ti          Predicates in Sidaama can be either verb predicates, as in (3.436a) and (3.436b),or NP predicates (with noun-phrase clitics), as in (3.436c)-(3.436i). The clitic di=attaches to clause-final constituents, as in (3.436a), (3.436c), and (3.436e)-(3.436i), or topreverbal constituents, as in (3.436b) and (3.436d). Each type is discussed with examplesbelow. In this language, focus is placed on a preverbal constituent. As indicated in theglosses for some of the examples of (3.436b) and (3.436d), when di= attaches to apreverbal constituent, the constituent is contrasted to other constituents that (potentially)stand in a paradigmatic relation with it.• di=verb: (3.436a)          When used as a predicate, any verb in the present perfect, imperfect, progressive,or continuous aspect, can be negated by di=, which immediately precedes it, as in(3.437)-(3.442).7878
   When this clitic is attached to a verb, the verb has to be in the present perfect, imperfect, progressive, or
continuous aspect, and cannot be in the simple perfect. When the progressive form of a verb, “V-PERS-
INF-INST exist” (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.1), is negated with the clitic di=, it occurs immediately before
the content verb, as in (ia), rather than immediately before the existential verb, as in (ib).","[304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"
          The negation of V2 in the manner/concomitance construction has scope over boththe manner/concomitance and the event component expressed by V2. An example of amanner/concomitance construction whose V2 is negated is shown in (6.33) (this isnormally not interpreted as the temporal inclusion construction); the negation of V2results in negating both of the event components.,[732]

          The locative suffix -nni can also follow genitive-case marked temporal nouns. Asdiscussed in Chapter 3 (section 3.1.4), instead of the genitive noun followed by thissuffix, the citation form of the noun may serve as a bare-NP adverbial.(4.133)          sood-u-nni ‘in the morning’ (soodo ‘morning’)

                 hawad-u-nni ‘in the rainy season’ (hawado ‘rainy season’)
          The use of -nni for the locative notion is basically limited to locational nouns,temporal nouns, demonstrative pronouns, and common nouns for events, and when -nnioccurs with other types of nominals, it normally serves as either the ablative suffix or theinstrumental suffix, as discussed below.20
20
  There are a few exceptions to this. Nafara ‘compound’, ate ‘backyard’, and ama ‘river bank’ can take
-nni as well as the locative suffix (-ho/-te/-ra). Mine ‘house’, hadiro ‘[animal section in a house]’, and                                                 - 379 -

         There are two other uses of the suffix -nni, which cannot be classified into any ofthe above. In the first case, the suffix -nni can be used in three constructions that havethe form “V1-PERSON-INF-nni V2”. One construction expresses the temporal inclusionof V2 in V1, ‘(while) doing V1, V2’, as in (4.134), and another construction expressesthe manner/concomitance in V1 of the action of V2, ‘V2 with the manner/concomitanceof V1’, as in (4.135) (Chapter 3 section 3.1.4, Chapter 6 section 6.2.2). Note that neitherof these constructions have causal meanings. In both of these constructions, the subject
ama ‘river bank’ can also take -nni, but not the locative suffix (though it can take -ho as the dative suffix).

previous nouns, they have to be in the genitive case when used with -nni. Examples are shown in (ii).(ii)     (a)                                  k’oonc-u-nni

The negative versions of the manner/concomitance construction and the extendedcausation constructions use the simple perfect and the negative suffix, rather than theperson suffix and the infinitive suffix, before the suffix -nni.21

                 ‘May your house be empty!’ (a cuse used by a begger who asks for
                 money)
The negative form of the optative is formed by adding the suffix -nke to the optativesuffix, as in (4.229).(4.229)          min-i-kki                           mulla ikk-o-nke !

                 ‘May your house not be deprived!’ (a praise for the addressee)
          There is another use of the optative suffix. It is often used in an interrogativeclause that asks about ability or for permission, with very high pitch placed on thepenultimate vowel of the verb. When used this way, the subject can be the first-personplural as well as the first-person singular and the third person, but cannot be the secondperson, as shown in Table 4.15.","[449, 450]"
"It investigates how the schematic and the non-schematic components of the five types ofevents (motion, state change, realization, temporal contouring, and action correlating)appear morphosyntactically in this language.

Nevertheless, even when multipleconsultants on a language are employed, it would be difficult to ask all of them exactlythe same set of questions to write a grammar of the language; a bias toward the judgmentof even a small number of linguistic forms by a certain speaker or speakers out of a groupof consultants would be inevitable. The consultation with a single speaker makes it easyto obtain consistent data.

"       If Sidaama is compared with the most studied East Cushitic language, Somali(e.g., Saeed 1993[1986]), there seem to be many clear differences between these twolanguages. First, Somali has what are called “indicator particles” (Tucker 1966: 541,Andrzejewski 1975, Livnat 1983), while Sidaama lacks them. Second, Somali hasdefinite articles, interrogatives, and demonstratives that are suffixed to nouns (Saeed1993[1986]: 120-122, 160-165), whereas Sidaama has adnominal demonstratives, which

"        Talmy (1985, 1991, 2000b, etc.) investigated event integration patterns acrosslanguages, and found that languages fall into one of two typological types depending onhow components of the macro-event are syntactically expressed, particularly, (i) whetherthe core schema of the framing event is expressed in the verb (the framing verb) or in thesatellite (the framing satellite) (e.g., ‘down’ in (6.3) when the hill is not expressed),which is “the grammatical category of any constituent other than a nominal orprepositional-phrase complement that is in a sister relation to the verb root” (Talmy2000b: 102, 222), and (ii) whether the co-event appears in the satellite or adjunct, or inthe verb.1 Those languages that usually express the core schema of the framing event in averb and the co-event with a satellite or adjunct are called “verb-framed languages” (“V-languages”, henceforth), whereas those languages that characteristically express the coreschema of the framing event in the satellite (sometimes, a satellite plus an adposition, oran adposition alone) and the co-event with a verb are called “satellite-framed languages”(“S-languages”, henceforth).           V-languages include: Romance languages, Semiticlanguages, Korean, Japanese, Tamil, Polynesian languages, Bantu, some branches ofMayan, Nez Perce, and Caddo. On the other hand, S-languages include: most Indo-European languages minus the Romance languages, Finno-Ugric languages, Chinese,

                  to mean, ‘She is that tall man’s sister.’          It should be noted that the use of adjectives like nouns is different from the use ofadjectives as nouns. In Sidaama, the noun modified by an adjective can sometimes beomitted.33 In this case, the adjective modifying the omitted noun looks as if it wereserving as an argument. This happens when the referent of the omitted noun isunderstood by the conversation participants to be a particular entity. It also happenswhen the referent is compared to another entity that belongs to the category of theomitted noun that has a property different from the one expressed by the adjective. For
33
   Dryer (2004) points out that there are two types of cases where noun phrases without nouns (or
pronouns) (i.e., those consisting of elements that would otherwise be optional modifiers of “head” nouns)
are likely to be used: (i) “when the speaker does not know what kind of thing the thing that they are
referring to is” and (ii) “when the kind will be so obvious to the hearer that it can be left out” (p.70). Dryer
argues that in the case of (i), nouns do not have a privileged status in noun phrases, and proposes that all
noun phrases are headless; he questions the ‘head’ of an NP as a universal notion. On the other hand,
according to him, in the case of (ii), ellipsis of the noun is likely to be involved.
          The use of noun phrases in Sidaama that do not contain nouns, as in (3.145) and (3.146), is an
example of the latter case. Such noun phrases in Sidaama can occur only when the hearer knows what the
ellipsed noun is.","[175, 176]"
A Sidaama sentence normally ends in a suffixed verb or the predicating noun-phraseclitic (=ho/=te or =ti). Non-WH-questions are usually only indicated by an intonationpattern in the final or semi-final word of a sentence different from that in its declarativecounterpart (Greenberg 1963: universal 8).,[92]
"For example, the direct object of the active construction (5.51) (wot’e ‘money’) can be8
  When the subject NP whose head is =hu has a masculine singular referent, it can be the subject of the
relative clause that it heads, even when the sentence is identical in structure to the “RC=hu ...=ti”
construction. For example, (i) and (ii) appear to be used in the form of the “RC=hu ...=ti” construction, but
are not. The NP headed by the clitic =hu has a masculine singular referent, and has to be the subject or
direct object of the relative clause.(i)      lat’o          an-ø-ino=hu                          danura=ti.

  (5.50) would be grammatical if =hu were replaced by the feminine noun-phrase clitic =ti to form a
perfectly grammatical sentence, as in (i). However, the sentence is not an instance of the cleft construction;
the first =ti is the nominative form of the noun-phrase clitic (Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.1, section 5.4.2.1),
which is the head of the relative clause (see also footnote 6).(i)      lat’o           an-t-ino=ti                          bule=ti.

   In Sidaama, a constituent in the preverbal position is generally focused. As discussed in Chapter 3

2.3.4 Pause       Sidaama often uses pauses to indicate constituent boundaries. When the sentencehas SOV word order, a pause usually occurs between the constituent boundaries (Teferra2000: 16-17), as in (2.73). (In the examples in this section, pauses are indicated with //.)

       ‘Bule kissed Dangura.’In a sentence of OSV order such as (2.74), a long pause can generally occur after the firstconstituent.

       ‘Bule kissed Dangura.’The constituent structure of a transcribed sentence can differ depending on the location ofa pause, especially because some case forms are morphologically identical (specifically,the nominative and the accusative of a feminine noun, the genitive and dative/locative ofan unmodified feminine common noun, and the genitive and nominative of a masculinenoun) and the person/number/gender of the subject can be indicated by the verb suffixalone, rather than the subject being expressed as independent nouns or pronouns. Forexample, each pair of sentences in (2.75) and (2.76), which look morphologicallyidentical, differ in the locations where pauses as well as high pitch accents are placed.","[95, 96]"

"3.2.2.1 Noun-Phrase Clitic: =ta/=ha/=re          Sidaama has two types of clitics that form NPs with constituents that modify them(in other words, that might be analyzed as the heads of NPs). One type is discussed inthis section, and the other type is discussed in the next section.57          The type of noun-phrase clitic (NPC) dealt with here has the following accusativeforms: =ta (F)/=ha (M)/=re (PL) (its other case forms are discussed shortly). It has threeuses (i)-(iii) in Table 3.17, each of which are illustrated with the examples in (3.336)-
57
   An alternative analysis of the first type of NPC may be that it is a nominalizer that turns an open
sentence into an NP and a sentence into a CP. However, when it attaches to an adjective or a non-genitive
NP, it cannot form an argument NP, though it can form a predicate.",[260]

          An NP made up of a genitive NP and the clitic =wa can also be followed by theablative suffix, -nni, to express the source of a motion. When used this way, =wa is inthe genitive form =wi, and is immediately followed by -nni (this suffix can be omitted;e.g., isi=wi in (3.389), min-i=wi in (3.390), hakk’icco-te=wi in (3.391)). When thereferent of a genitive NP that =wi follows is animate and not a location, this clitic makesit more location-like. For example, in (3.389), the movement of the book does notoriginate from the inside of his body, but starts from his hands, around him, or histerritory. Thus, =wi has to follow isi ‘[3SG.M.GEN]’ to locationalize it.

                   ‘Bring the book to me from him.’74When the source of a movement is expressed by a noun whose referent is inanimate andcan be interpreted as a location, the noun can be followed by either =wi-nni or theablative suffix -nni alone. In the former case, the starting point of the motion has a widerrange of area than in the latter case. For example, in (3.390) and (3.391), (a) can have the

to express the same content as a genitive noun followed by =wa.","[285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291]"
