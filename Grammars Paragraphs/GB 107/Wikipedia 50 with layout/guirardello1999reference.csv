Let us first realign them strictly on the basis of word order:affirmative:                Adj     Subj (Cop)                  Subj Adj
negative:                   Adj tak Subj (Cop)                  Subj Adj anuk        Looking at the negative modality, we observe that when the order is nominal, thenegator is verbal, and conversely, when the order is verbal, the negator is nominal. Inother words, the negator has always opposite “polarity” in relation to the word order.","[230, 231]"
"Hahak does not modify the adverb directly; the adverb is presented, followed by a pause,and then hahak comes, negating apparently a presupposed question that includes theadverb: [ (Am I going to sleep) here? No.]. In the case of a verb, we have the Negationparticle tak, modifying the verb (example 72). It is also possible to have the whole clauserepeated, but now in the negative modality (73).e      Adverb

Other negative words (‘nobody’, ‘nothing’, ‘never’)          As Givon (1984:323-328) points out, negative sentences normally are not used bythe speaker to convey new information about the verb or its arguments, but rather to denyinformation that the speaker thinks the listener has in mind. Any negative act has apresupposed (or backgrounded) portion and an asserted (or foregrounded) portion. Thebackground portion means that there is some shared knowledge between speaker andlistener, who have a kind of communication contract. The negation denies the assertedportion of the corresponding affirmative sentence, but the presupposed portion is notdenied. So, when a speaker negates an event involving an entity, he may deny that theevent happened, or that the entity was involved in the event, but he does not deny theexistence of the entity, which is assumed by the speaker. As Givén says, the negation ofthe referentiality of the entity is coded by other forms, such as the negative words nobodyand nothing.","[274, 275]"
"        First, there is a short section on declarative clauses; a general view of this kind ofclauses will allow us to see better the differences between them and the clauses in othermodalities. Next, we have sections on interrogative clauses (with polar and non-polarquestions), followed by a section on negative clauses, exploring negation in verbal andnon-verbal predicates. The negation of single elements, and negative words such as‘nobody’ or ‘nothing’, will also be addressed. Finally, we have a section on imperativeconstructions in the affirmative and negative modalities.",[256]
"        In the case of Transitive verbs, there is no parallel form to wanach (something likewakich). The only difference between negative and affirmative Imperative for Transitiveverbs is that in the negative modality the particle waki follows the verb rather thanprecedes it:°(89)    mapa         tak   waki.
        break Neg Imp
        ‘Do not break it!’(90)        a.kiti   tak      waki.
              give Neg Imp
              ‘Do not give (it).’            b. *kiti tak wakich.",[139]
"
            With regard to wanach, it is interesting to observe that this particle can also befound in an Imperative construction with a noun that is a predicate,’ but the construction
8 Unfortunately, there is no data with wa, the Imperative particle for animate O.
° With regard to the Imperative construction with adjectives as predicate, it can use both wana and wanach,
as already mentioned in chapter 2 (cf. section 2.2.4).
                                                                                                            114in this case is affirmative, not negative:'°(91)     di             wanach
         woman          Imp
         ‘Be a woman’ (behave like a woman)                                [di here is a nominal word]         If the same nominal root behaves as verbal word (as already described in chapter2, section 2.2.1), it is then requires the particle wana:(92)     wana di
         Imp    have.woman
         ‘Marry!’ (lit: Have a woman)                            [di here is a verbal word]
         As we can see in the examples above, the Imperative construction with a negatedIntransitive verb (88) and the Imperative with a nominal predicate (91) pattern togetherwith regard to their preferred Imperative particle (wanach). It is interesting to observe thatsuch alignment is observed in other parts of Trumai grammar as well; for example, whenthe word order of a negative clause is “reversed” and the verb modified by the Negationparticle appears in first position, the configuration of the clause is nominal rather thanverbal: [V Neg ka_in Subj Cop]. The configuration of negative clauses is discussed
'0 The consultants had difficulties in giving the negative version of example (91), i.e., ‘do not be a woman’.
The example they offered is the same as the negative version of (92):
(i)      di       tak    wanach
         woman Neg Imp
         ‘Do not marry.’ or ‘Do not be a woman (do not behave as a woman).’We expected the nominal predicate to be negated by anuk, but the consultants insisted on the data above. It
might be that the use of di here is more adjective-like than noun-like, because negative Imperative
constructions with adjectives are also negated by tak:
(ii)     tsi-xerere tak       wanach
         TSI-wet Neg Imp
         ‘Do not become wet!”","[139, 140]"

Again, clauses with verbs showthe syntax of nominal predicates, but the Negation particle used is the one that typicallymodifies verbs, tak.

19 This is observed with Transitive verbs too:

           ‘I did not call you.’
20 In affirmative answers, the order [V ke ka_in S Cop (DAT)] or [V ke ka_in A O Cop (DAT)] is used
when the verb refers to an habitual event (e.g. I work). In negative answers, this order occurs for non-
habitual events (e.g. I am not working, I did not work). When the negative answer refers to a habitual event
(e.g. I do not work), the morpheme t(a)ke ‘Privative’ is used (cf. chapter 4, section 4.3).

        (same as example (65-b)        Looking at these two last examples, we can see that the morpheme ke is notpresent in the clauses. When the Negation particle tak is used, the presence of themorpheme ke is not obligatory (so far, we have not identified a difference in meaning):

          ‘He does not have long arms.’        Then a question arises: can the order between ke and tak be reversed, in order tonegate not only the verb, but the whole predicate? The answer is no. The negator tak isused if we negate the verb itself, that is, if we want to negate the nucleus of the predicate.","[223, 224, 225]"
"         In the case of attributive predicates, the possibility of choosing a nominal or averbal Imperative particle, observed in the affirmative modality, is lost in the negativeconstruction, where only wanach - the same particle used for nominal predicates - isobserved. Therefore, the Imperative construction in the negative modality has anasymmetrical system, with the boundaries between the different kinds of predicatesbecoming a little fuzzier.",[280]
"          Back to the negation of pieces of information, what about when the piece beingnegated involves an adverb or a verb? In the case of an adverb, the negative word used ishahak, which means ‘no’ and which can be the answer to a yes/no question (example 71).",[274]
"          In Trumai, there are no special words like English ‘nobody’ or ‘nothing’, but thereare ways of expressing the same idea. Let’s see how the negation of referentiality isexpressed in Trumai.e      nobody
          The idea of ‘nobody’ is expressed through the negation of the verb plus the use ofthe noun yaw, which literally means ‘people’, but when in a negative clause, has theopposite meaning: ‘no people’. For example:(74)       hu’tsa tak   chi_in    hachi   yaw-as.
          see      Neg Foc/Tens |    Cop human.being-Dat
          ‘I did not see anybody.’
                                                                                                            248(75)        midoxostak       ka_in          hai-ts     yaw   chi.
           call       Neg Foc/Tens          1-Erg      people Cop
           ‘I did not call anybody.’(76)       hu’tsatak       yaw        chi         ine-tl.
           see   Neg people people 3-Dat
           ‘Noboby saw him.’           In existential clauses, the idea of ‘nobody’ is expressed through the use of thepostposition nik ‘without’, which modifies the noun yaw:(77)      yaw       nik            ka_in.
          people without Foc/Tens
          ‘There is nobody.’¢      nothing
          The idea of ‘nothing’ is implied by the negative modality of the clause, plus thefact that there is no “patient” mark in the clause: in the case of an Extended Intransitiveverb, the complement is completely omitted (example (78)); in the case of a Transitive orExtended Transitive verb, there is no 3Abs enclitic in the clause (example (79)).","[275, 276]"
"         Finally, there is one alternative way for the expression of the negative Imperativewith verbs. Actually, this alternative way is not really an imperative construction, butrather a simple clause, with the [Verb + Negator] in first position, followed by the adverbnuk ‘then’.® This alternative way of expressing negative commands is possible both withIntransitive and Transitive verbs. As example, we have:(86)     ofa      tak nuk hi chi kasoro-s
         hit/kill Neg then 2 Cop dog-Dat
         “You do not beat the dogs!’(87)     mapa tak nuk atlat chi.
         break Neg then pan Cop
         ‘(You) do not break the pan.’
7 However, as already mentioned in chapter 3, this point needs to be rechecked with other Trumai
consultants.
8 Despite the similarity in the phonological form, the adverb and the negator anuk are not the same
morpheme. Their syntactic behaviors are different.
                                                                                                         253         It is interesting to observe that the Imperative constructions with verbs can alsoemploy the adverb nuk, as well as the adverb hen, translated as ‘then’ too (the semanticdifferences between hen and nuk are explained in chapter 3, footnote 12). The adverb henis usually used in the affirmative modality (88-89), while nuk is more often used in thenegative (examples (90-91). However, this is just a tendency, not a rule, since nuk canalso be found in affirmative imperative constructions (92).(88)     wanama        hen
         Imp eat       then                                                ‘Then, eat!”°(89)      waki kuhmu hen                                                   ‘Then, throw it!”
         Imp throw then(90)     sone    tak     nuk    wanach.                                    ‘Then, do not drink!”
         drink Neg then        Imper(91)     kiti tak nuk waki.                                                ‘Then, do not give (it)!
         give Neg then Imper(92)     wana fa’tsa nuk ik       ha ami-ki      hi-tl.
         Imp listen then first 1 speak-Dat 2-Dat
         ‘Then, first listen to what I say to you!’
9 Tn this context, the adverb ken ‘then’ seems to have a exasperation sense (“Then, eat!’) rather than
temporal sense (‘Eat then!’, as opposed to ‘Eat now!’).

                             and Grammatical Relations        In this chapter, the case system of Trumai is described. The alignments observedin the data show that this language has an Ergative-Absolutive system, and that there arefour verb classes in Trumai. This language has three kinds of obligatory arguments(Ergative, Absolutive, Dative) and these argument types are very important in describingthe system of the language. The traditional grammatical relations (Subject, Object,Indirect Object) do not play a central role in Trumai grammar. There are no syntacticbehaviors that support establishing a cross-cutting category of either ‘Subject’ (groupingA and S) or ‘Object’ (grouping O and DAT). It seems that this language works on thebasis of another principle: ‘Core’ versus ‘Peripheral’ arguments, with different degrees ofcore/peripheriality.","[280, 281, 282]"
"        If the clause has nominal-predicate configuration, and the clause is not in thenegative modality, the predicate can indicate a temporary state if the predicate containsonly an adjective, or a permanent attribute if the adjective is modified by ke, probably therelativizer morpheme. If the clause is in the negative modality, it indicates permanentattributes (ke can also appear, but its use is optional in this case).
                                                                                                             203         If the clause has a verbal-predicate configuration, the predicate always indicatestemporary states, in both negative and affirmative modalities. However, in the negativemodality, the use of the verbal negator tak is allowed only with the word order [Adj takSubj Cop]. As already explained in the previous section, verbal predicates can alsopresent this word order when in the negative modality, but this construction is not thetypical one, since it is a “blend” of nominal and verbal predicates (it has the Copula andnominal word order, but the verbal negator). However, that is the only order allowed withattributive predicates if the negator is tak.                                              permanent                                 temporary

         ‘J will not give the knife.’        In relation to other possible ways of expressing negation of verbs (actually,negation of roots that can be considered verbal), we have the use of the word t(a)ke‘Privative’. Actually, the clause is not really in the negative modality, since no negationparticle is employed, but there is a sense of negative condition due to the semantics oft(a)ke. When contrasted with negative clauses that have tak, clauses with t(a)ke actuallypresent a semantic difference: the negative condition indicated by t(a)ke is permanent. Forexample:(29)    ami   tak   ka_in       chi-n.

         ‘He does not speak (he never speaks, he is mute).’
        [ lit: He is deprived of speaking.]        The use of the ‘Privative’ t(a)ke is the only alternative way of expressing negationfor verbal roots. The occurrence of the negator n(i)kik, whose use is observed in nominalpredicates (cf. section 6.3.2.1), is not possible with verbal roots:(31)    a.sonetak ka_in        hachi.

Negating other elements of the verbal predicate             For the negation of a S or O argument, we have clefts® in the negative modality,with S/O in first position, followed by the Copula and the negator anuk:e S:
(32)         hachi anuk chi         katnon ke.
             1 Cop Neg Foc/Tens work Rlzr
             ‘It was not me who worked.”e O:

             2 sister Cop Neg 1-Erg call             Rlzr
             ‘It was not your sister that I called.’             To negate the A argument, the negator anuk is also employed, directly followingA, which is naturally in first position.:e      6A:
(34)         hai-ts anuk     hi adifle midoxos.
             l-Erg Neg       2   sister call
             ‘(It was) not me (who) called you sister.’
             The negation of the DAT argument and other kinds of NPs usually employs thenegator tak. The constituent being negated comes at the end of the clause; additionally,there is a pause between the end of the clause and the negated element:
3 The construction in example (32) is a cleft. Observe the occurrence of the Relativizer ke and the presence
of two morphemes chiin the construction: one is the Copula, negated by anuk; the other one is the
Focus/Tense particle. The negator anuk is never observed modifying the Focus/Tense particles (in simple
clauses, anuk and the Focus/Tense particles cannot co-occur; cf. section 6.3.2.1).
*As mentioned, the negator anuk and the Focus/Tense particles cannot co-occur in the same clause. The
exception is negative clefts, like the example above, where anuk and the particle co-occur. However, notice
that here the Focus/Tense particle is in its reduced form (i.e. chi). The occurrence of the full form (i.e.
chi_in) is not accepted by the Trumai consultants:
(i)          * ha chi anuk chi_in katnon ke.
             (It was not me whe worked.)The construction above needs further investigation, in order to be better understood.
                                                                                            238e DAT:

      l-Erg     1 hand cut   knife YI Instr Neg
        ‘I cut my hand, (but) not with a knife.’        Apparently, there are other possible strategies for negating the DAT argument,like the examples below. However, in example (38), one can wonder if what is beingnegated is really a DAT or rather a phrase that is the nominal predicate of a non-presentsubject. That is, perhaps in example (38) we do not have ‘I saw somebody, (but it was)not your sister’, but rather ‘I saw somebody. (Whom I saw) was not your sister’. Thepresence of the negator n(i)kik, used for negating nominal predicates (cf. section 6.3.2.1)suggests the second interpretation. See the discussion presented in section 6.3.5 withregard to this issue (and also with regard to the use of hahak).(37)    inatl-ekkafe    yi kiti Kumaru-tl.    hai, hahak.
        3-Dat coffee YI give Kumaru-Dat 1          no

        ‘I saw somebody, (but) it was not your sister.’6.3.2. Negation in non-verbal predicates        In the next section, we have an overall view of how negation is expressed innominal, equative, locative, and existential predicates.
                                                                                         239
6.3.2.1. Negation in nominal and equative predicates       Nominal predicates are negated via the Negation particle anuk. Since one of thepossible orders for nominal predicates is [Pred Subj (Cop)], no special strategies arenecessary to narrow the scope of anuk. The Focus/Tense particles cannot co-occur withanuk. Examples:(39)    axos   anuk    ha chi.
       child Neg     1 Cop
       ‘Tam not a child.’(40)   paye         anuk     hi chi.

       “You are not a shaman.’(41)   a.t-eche               anuk     ha chi.

          ‘I am not her husband.”       b. *t-eche anuk ka_in ha chi.
          (I am not her husband.)
       There is an alternative way to express the idea of negation in nominal predicates,involving use of the morpheme n(i)kik (probably another kind of nominal negator).","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"
"When modified by the Negation particle tak, Intransitive verbs align with nominalpredicates (both use the particle wanach). On the other hand, nominal predicates alignwith verbs when the Negation particle tak is employed in the negative Imperative
                                                                                                      252construction.’ Even the Transitive verbs show certain alignment with to nominalpredicates, if we take into account the fact that the Imperative particle follows the negatedTransitive verb, like it does with nominal predicates.","[279, 280]"
"       We also have in this section a discussion with regard to scope, based on the ideasof Givon (1984). As he explains, sometimes the scope of negation can be narrowed down,with only one constituent being negated (the verb, a NP, etc.). By narrowing the scope, aspeaker can make the grounds of denial more precise. When scope is not narrowed, wehave a neutral negation, that is, the event as a whole is denied. According to Givon,different strategies can be used for the negation of a single constituent. Some languagesfront the constituent to be negated; other languages move the constituent to the clausefinal position. Trumai has both strategies, but fronting is more common.

6.3.1.1. Negating the verb         As already mentioned in chapters 3 and 5, to negate verbal predicates, theNegation particle tak follows the verb, or the verb plus other elements, such asauxiliaries. Negative clauses can present different word orders, depending on whether theclause is a simple statement or an answer to a question. When it is the second case (i.e.answer), the clause has a nominal-predicate configuration (cf. chapter 5, section 5.2.3 onthis issue). For instance:              A                                    V     Neg

           ‘There are no people in the house.’(lit: People are without people in the house.)        Observe that in (109) the order of the physical location piken ‘in the house’changes, but the structure of the rest of the clause is the same: Pred Subj. Example (109)is typologically uncommon, since existential constructions in most languages do not havethe entity expressed twice in the clause. Perhaps (109) could be better understood if weconsider the relationship between locative and possessive or existential predicates. Clark(1978) points out that there is a locative basis for both existential and locative
                                                                                                                213constructions, and that the possessive construction could be analyzed as a more abstractkind of location. So, when we say The book is Mary’s, we could say that the book can belocalized in relation to Mary, in the same way that the book can be localized in relation tothe box if we say The book is in the box. The same would be true for a clause such as Thebook is with Mary.","[238, 239]"
"        The characteristics of the affirmative Imperative constructions in Trumai aresummarized below:Verbal Predicate:
(Extended) Intransitive                                wana     V
(Extended) Transitive - animate O                      wa       Vv
(Extended)Transitive - inanimate O                     waki     VNominal Predicate:                                     Pred wanachAttributive Predicate:                                 wana Pred
                                                       Pred wanach
        In some examples we observe that a DAT argument can be included in theimperative construction, coming before the Imperative particle or after the verb. O canalso be included, but notice that this occurs more often with body part terms; we believethat the body part term occurs in the imperative construction because it is actuallyincorporated into the verb (cf. chapter 9, section 9.1.2.2). The S and A arguments arenever attested in the imperative construction. Examples:(83)     ine-tl waki kiti
        3-Dat Imp give                                           ‘Give (it) to him.’(84)    wana     waimi hai-tl
        Imp      tell    1-Dat                                   ‘Tell me.’(85)    wa     kud       tete.

                                                                                          251        The imperative constructions in the negative modality present a more complexscenario. The construction with Intransitive verbs involves the use of the Negationparticle tak modifying the verb, followed by the Imperative particle wanach. Theconstruction with Transitive verbs employs the same particle used in the affirmativemodality, waki, with the difference that now the particle follows the verb modified by theNegation particle tak.","[278, 279]"
"Unlike the Causative, Intensity and Negative particles, the Imperative particles precedethe verb:(26)      a. wana sone                   ‘Drink!’
          b. waki husa                   ‘Tie it (thing)!
          c. wa husa                     ‘Tie him (animal, people)!’
          There is one more Imperative particle, wanach, which follows the verb. However,it only occurs with a verb already modified by the Negation particle tak:
                                                                                            95(27)   sone tak wanach                       ‘Do not drink!”
        drink Neg Imp
3.1.3. The 3Absolutive enclitic -n/-e       The enclitic -n/-e occurs on the last element of the VP, usually the verb. If theverb is modified by an auxiliary, the Causative or Intensity particle, or an adverb, theenclitic attaches to the verb modifier (cf. chapter 4; cf. sections 3.3 and 3.4).","[120, 121]"
"           Existential predicates have word order Loc Subj (or Pred Subj), but no alternativeorder is possible.* The Copula in general is not used, while the presence of theFocus/Tense particle is highly frequent. As we can see, there are many overlaps betweenthe characteristics of existential predicates and the locative/nominal ones. Thus,sometimes it is hard to tell if a clause in the affirmative modality is an existential or alocative/nominal predicate. The existential reading is preferred depending on theconversational context. For example:*4 This actually confirms a tendency already observed by Clark (1978): existential predicates tend to present
the order Loc Noun.

         use this clause with an existential reading when talking about strangers in the
        woods]

        ‘There are many fish.’
        [this clause could also be interpreted as: The fish are many. Speakers use this
         clause with existential sense when pointing to fish in the river]
        The negative modality can be expressed through the use of a construction with thepostposition nik ‘without’:(100)   misu_ nik        ka_in        iyi.
        water without    Foc/Tens IYI
        ‘There is no water.’ (lit: (It) is without water.)(101)   yaw             nik        ka_in           (iyi).

        This postposition is also found as an alternative way to express predicativealienable possession (cf section 5.2.6):(103)    sapaun nik           ka_in    ha chi.

Inexample (104) the lexical zero is due to discursive reasons, but the enclitic codifies the3rd person subject. As we will see in chapter 9, in several cases the absence of the encliticcan give to the clause a generic or existential sense (cf. section 9.1.1).","[235, 236, 237]"

         The negator anuk and the morpheme n(i)kik can alternate, but it is not clear whatthe semantic difference between them is:(46)    paye    anuk hachi.

         Equative predicates present the same scenario observed with nominal predicates;the only difference is that consultants seem to prefer the use of n(i)kik over anuk:(48)     Aria che       anuk Tawapi’ yi.
         Ariahusband Neg Tawapi YI
         Tawapi is not Aria’s husband.’nik is a postposition that modifies NPs in simple clauses:

5 If we want to say ‘I have the shaman (because I kidnapped him)’, the clause will be:

        As already mentioned in chapter 5, locative predicates are negated with the verbalnegation particle tak. Apparently, there is no alternative way to negate locatives. Asexamples, we have:(51)    pike-n        tak   ka_in       ha chi.
        house-Loc Neg Foc/Tens 1           Cop

        child YI    Foc/Tens    hammock-Loc        Neg
        ‘The child is not in the hammock.’6.3.2.3. Negation in existential predicates        Negation in existential predicates involves a construction with the postposition nik‘without’. This construction is also observed with alienable possession predicates (cf.section 6.3.3). The use of the negation particle anuk is not possible for existential clauses(if anuk is used in the same context, it changes the semantics of the clause). Examples:(54)   = misu_ nik      ka_in        iyi.
         water without Foc/Tens IyvI
          ‘There is no water.’ (lit: (It) is without water)

        ‘It (something) is not water’                    {not existential meaning]6.3.3. Negation in possessive predicates
        The Negation particle tak is used for both inalienable and alienable possessivepredicates, negating the verb. In the case of alienable possession, the negator modifiesk’ad ‘to have’. In the case of inalienable possession, the negator tak modifies thenominal root that indicates the possessed entity (and that behaves as the verb of theclause; cf. section 5.2.6). For instance:(56)     sapaun     ka_in    k’ad      tak   ke hachi.
        soap        Foc/Tens have      Neg   KE | Cop
        ‘I do not have soap.’                                   [alienable](57)    ato tak          ka_in    hachi.
        arm Neg          Foc/Tens 1 Cop
        ‘I do not have arms.’                                   [inalienable]
        The alienable possessive predicate has an alternative way of expressing negativesense, through the use of the postposition nik:(58)     yakir nik     ka_in = hachi.
        salt without Foc/Tens 1 Cop
        ‘I do not have salt.’        The inalienable possessive predicate also has an alternative way of expressingnegative sense, through the use of the word t(a)ke ‘Privative’. Although it is not clear asyet, the use of t(a)ke here seems to imply that the subject has never possessed the objectin question. For instance, (60) probably means that the speaker has never had a sister, as
                                                                                                  243opposed to a person who does not have a sister because she died. We raise this hypothesison the basis of other occurrences of t(a)ke, where the sense of ‘never’ is evoked.","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271]"

                                        PREFACE        This dissertation is a study of Trumai, an indigenous language spoken in thecentral area of Brazil, in the Xingu Reserve (see map, appendix 2). The current work isthe first attempt at organizing a reference grammar of this language, providing a generaldescription of how the system of Trumai is organized .","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"
"        An alternative analysis would explain the morphosyntax of a cleft as indicatingthe historical source of the modern construction, but would argue that, as in the case ofthe clefts for old obliques/NP Possessors that became main clauses (as argued in section5.1.3), the construction has been reanalyzed into a standard clause type. Thus, thepresence of the Copula, the morpheme ke relativizing the verb, and the Negation particleanuk would be explained. However, both the construction and the morpheme ke wouldhave changed their status as the construction was used more and more. Finally, it wouldhave been reanalyzed as a regular clause, with the difference that the verb comes in firstposition. The morpheme ke does not indicate relativization anymore; the fact that ke isoptional in the negative clauses would be evidence for reanalysis. The question is toidentify the function of ke in the examples (68-69b), (74), and (75) above.",[227]

5.4.2. Interjections           The Trumai interjections constitute a class by themselves. They are a closed set ofexpressions that occur independently, as a whole clause (especially in dialogues). TheTrumai interjections are:°?* ho’kela          ‘Really?!         (showing surprise because of some interesting news)
                   ‘Oh, OK.’          giving the idea that: ‘OK, I heard what you said’)
* tan              “Wow!”            (showing surprise)
¢ hukele           ‘True!’ or
                   ‘That’s right!’ (confirming some news that was just mentioned)
°a’tsi             ‘Ugh!’            (expression of repugnance)
* pl               ‘Oh, man!’       (showing surprise in a slightly bad way. It can be a
                                     complaint too)

                                         Modality        In this chapter, issues related to modality will be presented. Some of the issuestreated here were already mentioned in previous chapters; for this reason, some pointswill be treated briefly in this chapter, leaving more room for the issues that are new, suchas the alternative ways for expressing the negative modality in verbal and non-verbalpredicates.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256]"
"        It is not clear if this analysis is desirable; that is, if it is really necessary todistinguish every single instance of ke as being a different case, or if it would not bebetter to unify them. It is hard to make a decision. An additional fact that deservesattention is that a verb negated by tak patterns together with nominal elements in othercontexts, for example, in imperative constructions (cf. chapter 3, section 3.3.4, andchapter 6, section 6.4). Thus, perhaps the presence of morpheme ke in negative answershas to do with the negative modality itself rather than to the “answering question”construction. In the moment, what it is visible is that ke here interacts with both focus andnegation.",[228]
"            The construction for inalienably possessed entities does not involve a specialverb meaning ‘to have’. Rather, the nominal root referring to the possessed entity behavesas the verb of the clause, receiving verbal morphology           (as already exemplified in section2.2.1). In this context, the root no longer means anymore ‘an X’, but ‘to have an X’. Forexample:(116)       a. t-adifle       ka_in      = hachi.

                                                                                                           217         The possession of alienable entities involves a special kind of clause: the wordk’ad, which literally means ‘hand’, behaves as the verb of the clause (and probably means‘to have’ here), and both the NP-possessor and the NP-possessed occur in the Absolutivecase, which is a pattern completely different from those observed elsewhere in thelanguage.’ In a verbal predicate, when one of the NPs is in the absolutive case, the othersare in the ergative, dative or remaining cases. However, here two NPs are both in theAbsolutive; case marking is not allowed in the NP-possessed (examples 123b-c). In thiscase, how do we distinguish the possessor from the possessed? The possessor is the NPthat comes right before the verb k’ad (120), or right before the copula when there arechanges in the word order (121). When the possessor is not lexically realized, the 3Absenclitic occurs on the verb k’ad (example 122). As we can see, the possessor has thesyntactic attributes of an S argument (cf. chapter 7). Examples:(120)    tahu ka_in      ha k’ad.
         knife Foc/Tens 1 have
         ‘I have knife.’                               [possessor: ha, right before k’ad](121)    tahu    ka_in       k’ad   ke hachi.
         knife Foc/Tens have KE          1 Cop
         ‘T have a knife.’                             [possessor: ha, right before the copula](122)    [iyi] k’ad-e           tahu.
           IYI   have-3Abs      knife
         ‘He has a knife.’                             [possessor marked in the verb k’ad]
27 Given that the verb k’ad probably came from the noun k’ad ‘hand’, we could imagine that the
construction perhaps has evolved from something like [my hand is in/with a knife] to [I hold a knife] and
finally [I have a knife]. Later, the possessive pronoun for ‘my’ was probably reanalyzed as a subject
personal pronoun ‘I’, and the word for ‘hand’ was reanalyzed as verb (probably following the path:
grasp/hold> have; the common evolution observed in some languages is hand>grasp>hold>have, like in
French). This is merely speculation, since there is no direct evidence for this hypothesis, but the evolution
grasp>have is widely attested cross-linguistically, and the connection between ‘hand’ and ‘grasp’ should be
uncontroversial.

           1 have Foc/Tens          soap    YI
            ‘T have soap.”         b. *ha sapaun ka_in.
            (I have soap)         The construction with k’ad can be used for expression other kinds of“possession”, such as the example below:(125)   paye        ka_de_in                 ha k’ad.
         shaman Foc/Tens-already       1 have
         ‘I “have” the shaman (I kidnapped him).’         In relation to the expression of negation in predicative possessive constructions,we observe that the negation particle tak is required in all cases: in the case of alienablepossession, it modifies the word k’ad, which is the verb of the clause; in the case ofinalienable possession, it negates the nominal root that behaves as the verb:”8
?8 Notice that the construction in these examples is of the same kind as the ones discussed in section 5.2.3
Consultants consistently offer this word order (i.e. V Neg ka_in Subj Cop) when the possessive predicate is
in the negative modality.
                                                                                           219(126)   icha    tak     ka_in            hachi.

        knife Foc/Tens have Neg                    KE    1   Cop
        ‘I do not have a knife.’
        The same is observed with regard to the expression of the desiderative mood: theauxiliary t(a)ke modifies the word k’ad in the case of alienable possession, and thenominal root that behaves as the verb in the case of inalienable possession:(128)   ha icha-tke.
        1 tooth-Des
        ‘I want to have teeth.’(129)   tahu    ka_in           ha k’ad take.
        knife   Tens/Foc        1      have Des
        ‘I want a knife.’        Finally, as mentioned in section 5.2.1., besides the construction above, predicativealienable possession can present an alternative way of expressing negation, through theuse of the postposition mik:(130)   asuka   nik         ka_in              ha chi.
        sugar   without Foc/Tens 1                Cop
        ‘I do not have sugar.’ (lit: ‘I am without sugar.’)5.3. Expression of tense and aspect/modality in non-verbal predicates
        As said before, in verbal predicates tense or aspect/modality differences can beexpressed via the use of adverbs, the Focus/Tense particles ka_in and chi_in, andauxiliaries. Aspect differences are expressed by the use of auxiliaries, as shown in chapter3. Tense differences can be expressed in the following ways:
                                                                                                220Present:          use of the Focus/Tense particle ka_inPast:             use of the Focus/Tense particle         ka_in          for recent past
                  use of the Focus/Tense particle         chi_in         for more distant past
                  use of the adverb                       kaksu          ‘in.past’Future:           use of the adverb   hat’ke                             ‘in.future   (for sure)’
                  use of the adverb   ifke                               ‘in.future   (not sure)’
           The question is how time and aspect/modality differences are expressed in non-verbal predicates, given that they do not have a verb to be modified by an auxiliary. Aswe will see in the next subsections, the Trumai speakers have strategies for expressing thevariations in tense and aspect. We will start with the more simple cases (Existentialpredicates), moving later to the more complex ones (nominal predicates).","[242, 243, 244, 245, 246]"
"           In the affirmative modality, the imperative construction requires the use of theparticles wana, wa or waki, which precede the verb. The particles are selected dependingon the kind of verb being modified - Transitive (wa, waki) or Intransitive (wa) - and forTransitive verbs, depending on the semantic characteristics of the patient: animate (wa) orinanimate (waki); cf 3.4.4 for examples.
                                                                                          250
        For nominal predicates, the imperative construction uses the particle wanach,which follows the predicate (cf 3.4.4). Attributive predicates can use both wana,preceding the predicate, or wanach, following it (cf. 2.2.4).","[277, 278]"
"If we want to negate the predicate as a whole, then the Negation particle used is anuk,which typically negates nominal predicates, as illustrated above:        Vv           Neg S       Cop     DAT
(75)   ofa ke anuk ha            chi     fe’de-s.
       kill         Neg 1        Cop jaguar-Dat
        ‘I do not kill jaguars (habitually).’
                                                                                                200         In all of the examples given above, the clauses have the structure of a cleftconstruction: the verb is isolated in first position in order to be highlighted, it undergoesrelativization, and the Copula is present.”! So, example (68a), which is an answer to thequestion ‘Do you work?’, could be interpreted as: ‘Yes, I am one who works’. The use ofthe negator anuk in example (75) suggests that the verb is relativized. Therefore, onepossible analysis would be to say that all the examples above are instances of cleftconstructions with focus on the verb/predicate.","[225, 226]"
"        Other interesting facts observed in Trumai: (i) when a Transitive verb iscausativized, both the causer and the causee are marked as Ergative; (11) the main strategyfor voice manipulation is argument suppression; (iii) there is a construction that could beclassified as an instance of “possessor ascension”; (iv) the verb of a complement clausebehaves as an inalienably possessed noun (more specifically, as a body part term); (v)there are multiple types of negative clauses in Trumai.

"        It is also possible to have the Imperative construction with a verb modified by theCausative particle. Again, we will have wa or waki, depending on whether the entityaffected by the event is animate or inanimate:(87)    a. wa wapta ka.                                       ‘Make him fall.’
          Imp fall      Caus        b. waki wapta ka.                                     ‘Make it fall’
           Imp fall   Caus
                                                                                                        113        For the expression of the negative Imperative, there is the particle wanach. Thisparticle follows the verb rather than preceding it, and it is found with (Extended)
                                                                               verb is not
Intransitive verbs modified by tak. The use of wana preceding or following thepossible:(88)    a.sone         tak wanach.                            ‘Do not drink!’

"            The morpheme in sometimes can be found in affirmative clauses, such as inexamples (14-16) below. However, the occurrence of in in non-interrogative clauses israre. We hardly find examples like the ones above, while the number of affirmativeclause with ka_in and chi_in in is high.(14)     ni         in        ha chi.

The unit ka in is used to indicate events in the presenttime or recent past (i.e. the event happened just a short time ago and it is still alive in thespeaker’s mind), while chiin indicates events in a more distant past. The use of chiin ismore precise - it indicates only past events - while the use of ka in can generate someambiguity in the interpretation of the clause. Extralinguistic information, plus the use ofthe adverbs, help to solve the ambiguity.(17)     a. ha    ami      ka_in.

        Another way of expressing intensity is via reduplication. Actually, reduplicationin Trumai can be used to express several things: actions performed with intensity, withextra energy or extra speed, and actions performed several times. It also can be used foremphatic speech. The Trumai reduplication confirms a tendency already observed in
                                                                                             105other languages, in which reduplication is used for similar reasons (Kemmer 1993describes some of the functions of reduplication observed in languages of the world).","[130, 131]"
"        The morpheme ke of the third type is parallel to the enclitic of 3rd person -n/-ewith respect to the argument involved in their use (both are related to the Absolutive NP),but they are not of the same kind, since ke is not pronominal and it is not restricted to thethird person. Also, the enclitic occurs in complementary distribution with the lexical itemor pronoun which is the head of the Absolutive NP (cf. section 3.1.3), while ke occursmerely when the Absolutive NP is not adjacent to the verb (the NP is not in its “normal”position, but it is still present in the clause).

                               Nouns and Noun Phrases
        One of the main characteristics of Trumai is that it is basically an isolatinglanguage. There are not many inflectional morphemes and in general words consist of asingle morpheme. The Trumai word classes are: nouns (including pronouns anddemonstratives), verbs, adjectives, adverbs, auxiliaries, postpositions, interrogativewords, words of quantification (numerals and quantifiers), pluralizers (dual and plural),particles (such as negation, causation, imperative particles, etc.), subordinators andinterjections. Nouns and verbs are the two main open classes and the distinction betweenthem is clear. The case of adjectives is a little more complicated, because they share someof the characteristics of both nouns and verbs, but at the same time they presentcharacteristics that are unique to them; section 2.2.4. of this chapter will explore thecharacteristics of adjectives. As we will see later, pronouns and demonstratives can beanalyzed as a subclass of nouns, given the similarities in their behaviors.","[40, 41, 42]"
"        However, a problem remains: what are the semantic differences between the twoways of expressing temporary states? So far, the only difference that could be detectedwas due to pragmatic factors: the Subj Adj or Adj Subj (Cop) order is selected dependingon which information the speaker wants to highlight:(83)    kafe      yi     supi.
        coffee    YI      bitter
        ‘The coffee is bitter.” (comment)(84)    supi     ka_in         kafe   yi.
       bitter Foc/Tens coffee YI
       ‘The coffee is bitter (new info).’ (answer to the question: Is the coffee sweet?)        In sum, it seems that the more adequate way of understanding attributivepredicates in Trumai is to take into account whether the attribute being expressed ispermanent or temporary. If permanent, we have a nominalized adjective in a nominalpredicate and no further complications. If temporary, we have a “hybrid” predicate, withtwo possibilities: (i) nominal syntax but not-nominal nucleus (and consequently, not-nominal Negation particle); (ii) verbal syntax but not-verbal nucleus and not-verbal
                                                                                           206Negation particle. We could go deeper into this issue and explore the nature of adjectivesin general. As some scholars point out, adjectives refer to entities that are more time-stable than verbs, but less than nouns (Givén 1984). This being so, it is not surprising thatin some languages adjectives shows properties of both nouns and verbs, since theyconstitute an in-between category. Perhaps the temporal attributive predicates in Trumaiplay along with this in-between nature, oscillating between nominal (permanent) or verbal(temporary) characteristics. Could we say that an attributive temporal predicate withnominal syntax indicates a slightly less temporary attribute than one with verbal syntax?","[231, 232]"

3.2. Verbs        There is little verbal morphology in Trumai: the verb frequently bears the enclitic-nl-e ‘3Abs’, but as already said before this enclitic can also occur with other elements(cf. section 3.1.3). Some verbs may bear the prefix wa-, which seems to be a mark ofmiddle voice (cf. chapter 9 for details). There are no tense-aspect-mood affixes. Tense isexpressed through the use of adverbs or the two Focus/Tense particles ka in and chi in,whose primary function is to highlight important information: ka in highlightsinformation in events happening now or in the recent past, chi in in events that happenedin the past (cf. chapter 5). When a clause has neither adverbs nor the Focus/Tenseparticles, tense is understood from context. Aspect and mood are expressed via auxiliaries
                                                                                                          99(cf. chapter 4). Finally, postverbal particles indicate negation, intensity, and causation (cf.section 3.3).","[124, 125]"
"3.3. Particles        The elements that we call particles in Trumai do not form an internally coherentclass, being rather defined by exclusion from the other internally coherent categories.

Adverbs can occur in several positions,while particles have very specific scope, occurring only after the verb (+ auxiliaries) theymodify. In the case of Imperative particles, they occur before the verb. Auxiliaries modifyonly verbs (actually, predicates), while the Intensity and Negation particles can modifyalso adverbs and quantifiers. The imperative particles modify only verbs (or predicates),but precede them, while auxiliaries only follow the verb. The causative particle is themost complex of the Trumai particles, and perhaps could be analyzed as an auxiliary, butgiven that it has specific behaviors not exhibited by auxiliaries, it is more adequate totreat it as a particle too.","[127, 128]"
"         As a final remark, we would like to point out that the construction observed inexamples (100-101) - that is, lexical zero in the subject position and no presence of 3Absenclitic - can be found in the affirmative modality for the expression of naturalphenomena:(114)    tsi-xu’tsa    ka_in       iyi.

         ‘It is very hot.’ (the weather)5.2.6. Predicates for expressing Possession         The predicative possession constructions (i.e. ‘I have an X”) present the alienable-inalienable distinction already observed in the attributive possession construction (i.e.‘my X”). The possession of material objects requires a construction that is different fromthe one used for kinship terms and body parts. The alienable construction represents a
                                                                                                 216unique kind of clause, because it contains a verb with two Absolutive NPs. Theinalienable possession construction could have been treated as a part of the section onverbal predicates, but we preferred to analyze it here in order to give to the reader a wholepicture of predicative possession in Trumai.","[241, 242]"
"        The distinction between the auxiliaries and the verbal particles (i.e. Imperative,Negation, Intensity, and Causation particles) is somewhat more complicated because theyare very Similar: both auxiliaries and the particles are postverbal, internal to the VP, andthey have abstract content. Thus, we considered the possibility of eliminating the categoryof auxiliaries and treating them as being verbal particles too. We also considered thepossibility of doing the reverse, that is, including the particles into the auxiliary category.",[156]
"Below, we have some Trumai data where the idea of intensity or repeated action isinvolved:a. intensity:

Negation Particle        Like the Intensity particle , the negator tak can be considered a particle because itsposition of occurrence is restricted (therefore, it is not an adverb) and it can modifyseveral kinds of elements: verbs (plus auxiliary or intensity/causative particle), adjectivalpredicates, adverbs and quantifiers. Unlike auxiliaries, the Negation particle does notreceive the 3Abs enclitic, as already pointed in the section on this enclitic.

For example:(71)    a.mayumane tak            ka_in         ha chi.                          [V + Intens + Neg]

Causative Particle        The causative construction, which will be discussed in depht in chapter 8 (section8.1), involves the use of the morpheme ka, which occurs after the verb or predicate.(72)    hai-ts Yakair       sa          ka.
        1-Erg Yakairu dance Caus
        ‘I made Yakairu dance.’
(73)    hai-ts   ka_in           misu     yi   ofae ka.
        1-Erg Foc/Tens water YI hot                   Caus
        ‘Iam making the water hot.’        This morpheme is best analyzed as a particle because it cannot be considered amain verb, and auxiliary, or an adverb. Ka cannot be classified as a verb meaning‘to.make’ or ‘to.cause’, because it is never is found as the main verb of a clause. TheTrumai verbs meaning ‘to.make’ are the Extended Intransitive chuda and the Transitivekapan. We can speculate that ka is historically a reduced form of kapan, but even if this isreally the case, we must observe that there are differences between them, besides thedifference in form: (i) as already mentioned, ka is not found as the main verb of a clause,while kapan is; (ii) Kapan        is used to express ‘to make’ in the sense of producing amaterial object, not in the causative sense; on the other hand, ka is specialized in the moreabstract sense of ‘Causation’:(74)    hai-ts   ka_in       pike        tox kapan.
        1-Erg Foc/Tens house ?                 make
        ‘I made the house.’(75)    a. hai-ts chi_in          Yaka-k         so    (o)pi   ka,
          1-Erg Foc/Tens Yaka-Erg fire extinguish Caus
          ‘I made Yaka extinguish the fire.’        b. *haits chi_in Yaka-k so (o)pi kapan.
                                                                                                                108
         Therefore, if ka really came historically from kapan, its status is already differentfrom the source, both in terms of semantic and formal properties, which is exactly thescenario observed in the development of auxiliaries described by Heine (1993). Then thequestion is: could we say that ka is now an auxiliary for the expression of causation? It issimilar to auxiliaries in that it is not possible to have the morpheme (i)yi between the verband ka (cf. chapter 4, section 4.2.1.1):(76)      *hai-ts ka_in   Atawaka pa                   yi    ka.
           1-Erg Foc/Tens Atawaka marry                 YI   Caus
          (I made Atawaka marry.)         Also, ka can alternate word order with auxiliaries (V Aux Caus or V Caus Aux), a
fact not observed with the Negation and Intensity particles (cf. examples in section 3.1.2.,and in chapter 4, section 4.2.1.3). However, ka can alternate position with the Intensityparticle too, while the auxiliaries have not been observed doing this.° Besides this fact,there are other important differences between ka and auxiliaries:(i) the configuration of the causative construction with Transitive verbs is different fromthe configuration of clauses with Transitive verbs + auxiliaries. To consider themorpheme ka an auxiliary is not advantageous (cf. chapter 4, section 4.1. for discussionof this issue);
5 The alternations of ka with auxiliaries and the Intensity particle probably has to do with its origins from
the main verb, kapan ‘make’:

Thecleft construction in Trumai is used to indicate contrastive focus (cf. chapter 5, section5.1.2. for discussion of focus constructions). In the cleft, the Copula and the Focus/Tenseparticle are present, and the verb is modified by the relativizer ke, which follows the verb.","[131, 132, 133, 134, 135]"

These elements are the auxiliaries of aspect-mood, direction,and body posture (cf. chapter 4), the particles of Intensity (yumane), Causation (ka) andNegation (tak), and adverbs. All these elements occur inside the VP, following the verb(only adverbs also have the possibility of occurring outside; cf. section 3.4). Adverbs orthe Negation particle occur in the final position of the VP, preceded by the verb or verb+auxiliaries and/or other particles. The final element of the VP receives the 3Abs enclitic,helping distinguish between adverbs which are inside versus those which are outside theVP. Apparently there is an incompatibility between the enclitic and the Negation particle,since they never co-occur (cf. 3.1.3).","[118, 119]"

verbs, since the presence of only one argument makes it easier to analyze the organization of the clause. We
use Intransitive clauses as the basis for the comparison, but the facts presented here (i.e. position of enclitic;
word for negation) are also valid for Extended Intransitive and (Extended) Transitive clauses. When
necessary, we present information on these kinds of clauses too.
'S Nominal predicates can also present an alternative order (Subj Cop Pred), depending on pragmatic
factors:
(i)       a. tsi-tle         ka_in   ha chi.
             3Poss-mother Foc/Tens 1 Cop
             ‘I am his mother.’          b. ha chi   ka_in      tsi-tle.
             1 Cop    Foc/Tens   3Poss-mother.
             ‘His mother is me.’ (lit: I am (new info) his mother) (Q: Who is his mother?)
'6 As already mentioned in chapter 3 (section on Copula), there are actually two possibilities for the
nominal predicate:
(i) Occurrence of Copula:                        dika_in   chi-n.    ‘She is a woman.’
(ii) Occurrence of morpheme iyi:                 dika_in iyi-n.      ‘She is a woman.’The morpheme iyi/yi and the Copula cannot co-occur. Usually, the Copula is used, but when it does not
occur, the presence of iyi seems to be obligatory if the 3Abs enclitic -n/-e is used (iyi is the site where the
enclitic attaches).
""” Besides the use of anuk, which is more usual, there is an alternative way of expressing negation in
nominal predicates: the use of n(i)kik. See chapter 6, section 6.3.2.1.

5.2.2. Nominal roots as verb
          In chapter 2, we saw that a nominal root can function as a nominal word (‘an X’)or as a verbal word (‘to have an X’). If it functions as a verb, occurring in a verbalpredicate, it shows the behaviors observed with this kind of predicate (examples (b)below):Nominal vs. verbal, first person:
             Pred                  Subj Cop
(66)      adi            (ka_in)   ha       chi.                 ‘Tam a woman.’             Ss     V
          b. ha di ka_in.                                        ‘T am married.’ (said by man)
                                                                 (lit: I have a woman)Nominal versus verbal, third person:
            Pred                   Cop-subj
(67)      a.di     = (ka_in)       chi-n.                         ‘She is a woman.’             S_         V-subj
          b. iyi        di-n ka_in.                              ‘He is married’
                                                                 (lit: He has a woman).’5.2.3. Verbal predicate becomes similar to nominal predicate
          Sometimes both nominal and verbal predicates can become very similar in form,and that represents a problem of analysis. Basically, when the clause is an answer to aspecific question, and the verb codifies the new information or the information that needsto be confirmed, the clause has the structure of a cleft construction with the verb in focus.","[220, 221, 222]"
"        For clauses with Intransitive or Extended Intransitive verbs, when there is nolexical subject and the 3rd. person enclitic is omitted, the clause has a generic sense, withthe idea that some event is happening, but we cannot tell which entity is performing it(the event is described in a very vague way):         NPaps           Vv
(5)     iyi             ami   ka_in.
        ly!      speak Foc/Tens
        ‘There is something speaking.’ or ‘(It, something not identified) is speaking.’        NPats            V
(6)     iyi             ora    ka_in.
       IyI       crying Foc/Tens
        ‘There is something crying.’ or ‘(It) is crying.’         NPaps           V
(7)     iyi             sone ka_in.
        TY]             drink Foc/Tens
        ‘There is something drinking.’ or ‘(It) is drinking.’        The examples above could be analyzed as producing an effect similar to thepassivization that demotes Intransitive subjects, observed in some languages of the world
                                                                                          339
(such as Sanskrit or Dutch, which allow passivization of Intransitive verbs); that is,instead of describing that an entity is performing an event (‘something is speaking’), theclause would rather be a statement that an event exists: ‘there is speaking (by someindefinite entity)’. Notice that clauses that express natural phenomena or negativeexistential clauses also do not present a lexical subject nor the 3Abs enclitic:(8)     tsi-xu'tsa    ka_in         iyi.
        TsI-cold      _Foc/tens IYI
        ‘It is cold.’ (the weather)(9)     misu—   nik         ka_in          iyi.
        water without       Foc/Tens IYI
        ‘There is no water.’
        [if the clause had the Abs enclitic, its semantics would be different: “He does not
        have water.’]
        So, in some sense, examples (05-07) above are similar to negative existentialclauses or natural phenomena clauses in that neither has S morphology. However, theyare not the same; examples (05-07) cannot present the same word order as negativeexistential clauses (i.e. Pred Foc/Tens iyi):(10)    *ami ka_in iyi.
        (There is something speaking.)(11)     *sone ka_in iyi.
        (there is something drinking.)
        We still need to understand better the relationship between existential clauses andexamples such as (05-07). At the moment, what we can say with regard to the suppressionof the Absolutive argument in clauses with (Extended) Intransitive verbs is that this kind
                                                                                                              340of suppression produces a clause that has a generic sense, not providing informationabout the agent of the event that is described.’         The suppression of the Absolutive in clauses with Transitive or ExtendedTransitive verbs has a different semantic effect: antipassivization. Sometimes the verbdoes not present any sign of the Absolutive argument (i.e. no lexical Abs NP, no 3rd.person enclitic in the verb). This omission is observed when the patient/secondparticipant is not relevant for the main discourse, not definite, unimportant; therefore, itdoes not need to be mentioned. Examples:(12)     wan sa-tke-n-es,                  wan tete-n                         hen.
         PL dance-Des-3Abs-ES      PL make.beautiful-3Abs                      then
         ‘When they want to dance, they get painted.’         -ma       nuk hen!      -ina     hen, midoxos midoxos hen.
          let’s.go so then       - there then call         call       then
          “Let’s go!” - then, in  this occasion, they call  (other people, not defined here).’If the patient was definite or important, the clause would be:(13)     ina    hen,    wan midoxos midoxos-e hen.
         there then     PL call        call-3Abs then
         ‘Then, then, in this occasion, they call them.’                   [3p Absolutive enclitic is present]
' Another possible way of not expressing who is exactly the agent - giving the clause a generic/indefinite
sense - is to use the expression [yaw paine], which literally means ‘group of people’. A clause with [yaw
paine] can be translated as ‘they (indefinite) do X’:
(i)      yaw            paine sone wirix-ki.
         human.being group drink manioc.porridge-Dat
         ‘They (indefinite) drank the manioc porridge.’ or
         ‘The porridge was drunk (by somebody we do not know or do not want to say).”","[366, 367, 368]"
"
25 “Given the first term, we find here the property of the fundamental primitive operation, that of being
located by two identifications:
    - the first indicates that an occurrence is located with respect to its predicate:
           x is x= is what it is
    - the second, that an occurrence is located with respect to an abstract, spatial localization: is in the spot
where it is, which enables the construction of the predication of existence...” (Culioli 1995:150)
6 Actually, this is just a simplified version of the ideas of Culioli. His theory is much more complex.
                                                                                             214        In a clause like There is a book in the box / with Mary, the physical location - e.g.the box, Mary - could be considered a further refinement of the localization, making itmore specific, but the “main” localization, which asserts the existence of the entity, isabsolute. In other words, the existence would be the abstract and permanent localization;the localization in the box would be the physical and temporary location. After assertingthe existence of the entity in the universe (general localization), we would refine it, sayingwhere is its localization in the moment (specific localization).","[239, 240]"

4.1. Definition of the notion “Auxiliary” and the linguistic literature        As Heine (1993:4-5) points out, the term ‘auxiliary’ is not very well defined in thelinguistic literature: “in many languages, experts will disagree with one another indefining the term auxiliary, or in determining the range of entities that should besubsumed under this label, or in deciding whether there is a need for such a label in thefirst place”. The relationship between auxiliaries and verbs is also a subject of intensediscussion: some authors treat them as different categories; others refer to auxiliaries assubsets of verbs; there are authors that mention that some auxiliaries can have “main verbuses” too. Heine also observes that auxiliaries have an “amphibian nature”, being neitherclearly lexical nor clearly grammatical entities.
                                                                                             129        For Heine, the use of the term ‘auxiliary’ is “...primarily associated with a limitedrange of notional domains, most of all with the domain of tense, aspect, and modality”,although he says that auxiliaries are not restricted only to these domains. Heine analyzesauxiliaries using a diachronic/grammaticalization perspective, and he describes theschematic concepts employed in the evolution of auxiliaries from verbs (the form inevolution from one kind of meaning, more concrete, to another one, more abstract). Withthis approach, the behaviors exhibited by auxiliaries and their relationship with verbsbecome more clear. The basic idea is that “..an auxiliary is no longer a full verb but notyet a grammatical inflection either...” (Heine: 86). That is, auxiliaries are a kind ofintermediate form, which gives account in some degree for their behaviors.","[154, 155]"
"        Nominal and attributive predicates also employ the Imperative particle wanach,which follows the negated predicate. The predicate is modified by the Negation particletak, not anuk, as we would expect for nominal predicates.",[279]
