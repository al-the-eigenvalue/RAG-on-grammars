"8.3.1    Quasi-independent use
The negative circumfix can occur as the only marker on a final verb. In such in-
stances, I do not regard the circumfix as a true final primary inflection, but rather as
forming a derived stem that can function as the predicate of a final clause if there is
sufficient contextual support.34 The time reference of the predicate event is under-
stood to be current with the ‘now’ of either the speech event or the narrated world.
Examples are shown in (721) and (722). See also §11.1.3.4 concerning the use of
negated verbs in alternative interrogatives.(721)    ho=pi-na            inu    rindi-ta na-ra-ya.

The negative circumfix also occurs in combination with TAM inflections, in which
case it is added before the inflectional suffix. A verb root plus na- -ya forms a
negative stem that takes the same inflections as a regular verb (regardless of whether
or not the base root is regular or otherwise).
    Examples (723) to (726) show negative stems occurring with some of the final
TAM markers described in this chapter.(723)    ima      -yatia rekuma, no na-ke-ya-o.

    Verbs that are inflected with medial rather than final morphemes can sometimes be used in a
similar way. For example in conversation it can be acceptable to use a medial form such as hoa-ya
(come-DEP), ‘...coming...’, as a complete utterance, as long as more typically ‘finite’ values such as
time reference can be easily understood from context.

possible to express prohibition using the negative stem and the imperative suffix, as

     It is worth noting that during a conversation between myself, Kenny Kendoli, and Kirsty
Gillespie, Kenny reported that there is a strong metaphorical connection between fluid and emo-
tion in the Duna world. For example, people may describe strong emotion as a building up of fluid
that needs to be drained. See also Haley (2002) concerning the importance of water-flow in Duna
cosmology.
Chapter 8Final verb morphology: time, event
modality, and negation
8.1     Introduction
This chapter and the three that follow treat final predicate morphology in Duna,
looking in detail at certain bound morphemes that attach to the predicate element of
an independent clause.
     This introductory section includes a general overview of final predicate mor-
phology that is discussed in this thesis, with a particular focus on bound forms that
occur as inflections on verbal predicates. Section 8.1.2 lists the form variations of
the consonantal and wa-class verbs (introduced in §3.3.1) that are relevant to par-
tially suppletive verbal inflection and stem formation.
   The remainder of this chapter treats TAM markers that encode features of time
and event modality (§8.2), and indicators of negative polarity (§8.3).","[295, 296]"
"8.3.3    Negation with neya
An alternative negating form to the negative circumfix is the lexical negator neya
(‘NOT’).35 The lexical negator is not a verbal inflection, and functions like a complement-
taking predicate rather than a bound inflectional form. I include a brief description
of neya here because it is functionally related to the negative circumfix, and to aid
understanding of example sentences in which it occurs.36
    Unlike the negative circumfix, neya can occur as a negator in non-verbal clauses
expressing equation or proper inclusion, and can occur independently as a com-
plete utterance. As intimated by (Giles MSa:L5, L22), neya has features of a verbal
predicate, for example, it occurs in clause-final position and can take verbal inflec-
tions. It is unlike ordinary verbs in that it does not REQUIRE inflection and does not
subcategorise for NP arguments.
  35
      The sequence [nj3@] is also used as a negator. As it does not appear to differ from neya in
either meaning or distribution, and as there are obvious phonetic similarities, I assume that this is a
contracted form.
   36
      It seems likely that neya is also historically related to the negative circumfix. For example, one
possibility is that the lexical negator derives from an (unknown) verb negated with na- -ya, which
coalesced as a new word neya.
8.3. The negative circumfix                                                               303
    In a simple verbal clause negated with neya the final verb occurs in its root form
(regular verbs), imperfective stem form (consonantal verbs) or i-base form (wa-class
verbs). The verb ra- ‘be/sit’ occurs in its o-base form rao-.
    Neya can occur clause-finally without any predicate morphology, as in (729) -
(731).(729)   no waki neya.

        ‘I didn’t hear.’ (ED/V:62)(730)   no pikono kone       ri neya.

        ‘I am not telling a real pikono story.’ (P/AM:NH03T12A)(731)   no ngoya neya.
        1SG go.IPFV NOT
        ‘I didn’t go.’ (ED/V:62)   Neya can can also carry verbal inflection, as shown in (732) and (733).(732)   poranda-ta                  no riya neya-nda.
        cannibal.settlement-LOC 1SG return NOT-INT

        (T/RS:221203iii)    Examples (734) - (736) show neya occurring as a negator in a clause headed by
a verb series (7.3), verb adjunct (§7.4) and object-verb predication (§7.5.3), respect-
ively.(734)   antia khane       -ra-tia     pi, ame-khane            -ra-tia   pi   ruwa ngi

304             Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
   Neya can negate non-verbal clauses, describing the absence of a relationship of
proper inclusion or equation between two noun phrases, as in (737) and (738).(737)      ho-na       nane kete neya.
           here-SPEC boy little NOT
           ‘This one was not a little boy.’ (T/JS:KG05V5.40)(738)      ha-na        Ambo neya=nia.
           there-SPEC PSN       NOT= ASSERT
           ‘That one surely isn’t Ambo.’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).1)    Neya can also constitute an entire utterance. In my conversational experience
‘yes-no’ and ‘alternative’ interrogatives (§11.1.3) are most commonly answered
with the verb of the clause (negated for a ‘no’ answer and inflected appropriately
for a ‘yes’ answer), but may also be answered with ẽ ‘yes/I agree’ and neya ‘no/not
that’. Neya can also be used to negate a proposition more generally; see example
(542) in which the speaker refutes a command.
    In reported conversations in narratives it is quite common for neya to be spoken
once or twice at the beginning of a response to a question word interrogative, as
exemplified in (739). I do not know what factors determine appropriate use of
neya in this situation or how its meaning should be defined, beyond saying that it
functions as a kind of prelude to the answer.37 Perhaps this also assists in indicating
turn-taking when there is no overt marking of reported speech.(739)       a. Ogre: ka         ha-ra         peya-na        aki.

                ‘(Well you see), my mother and father died...’ (T/KP:070104iii)

       The use of a ‘no’-like word to introduce utterance also occurs in Kalam (Pawley pers. comm.).
Chapter 9Evidential and information status
markers
9.1    Introduction
In this chapter I introduce the use on final verbs of two groups of bound forms that
I term ‘evidential markers’ and ‘information status markers’. These markers are
broadly concerned with the overt indication of a speaker’s assessment of a proposi-
tion in terms of the way it is known or may be known.
    Duna evidential markers (§9.2) comprise a set of systematically contrastive and
mutually exclusive bound forms that mark information source, “the way in which
information is acquired” (Aikhenvald 2004:3) as a primary meaning; for example,
encoding the fact that the speaker visually witnessed the activity described by the
verb on which they occur. Duna information status markers (§9.3) have meanings
that relate in some way to ‘information status’; that is, they typically indicate some-
thing about the kind of information (for example, shared, surprising, certain) that
the proposition represents. Information status markers are mutually exclusive (with
one exception, see §10.2.4.4), but do not form a coherent paradigmatic set. Certain
evidential markers can co-occur with certain information status markers on a single
predicate (see Chapter 10).
    I describe the evidential and information status markers, as well as the epistemic
particles treated in§10.4, as formally encoding the semantic domain of ‘epistemic
assessment’, that is, how the proposition is known and what kind of knowledge it
represents. Epistemic assessment is concerned with the treatment of propositions as
subjectively informed mental artefacts or intentions.
    It is important to note that under this broad definition, epistemic assessment is
not specifically concerned with a speaker’s evaluation as to the reliability of know-
ledge and/or the commitment to a proposition as being ‘true’. Thus, I do not see it as
a synonym or subcategory of epistemic modality (or Palmer’s ‘propositional modal-                                         305
306                                 Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
ity’), which is typically defined as having to do with the speaker’s commitment to or
judgment of a proposition as being factual, likely, uncertain, etc. (see, for example,
Frawley 1992; van der Auwera and Plungian 1998; Palmer 2001; De Haan 1999).
In the case of some bound forms (for example, the uncertainty marker, §9.3.3.2) the
factual status of a proposition is a fairly central aspect of their meaning and func-
tion. However, it is not necessary to identify the encoding of a truth-value judgment
as the single most important meaning and function of the Duna forms that I describe
in this and the following chapter.1
    As outlined in §8.1.1.1, most evidential markers and some information status
markers can occur as either primary inflections, or as ancillary markers. In this
chapter I describe their occurrence as primary inflections, that is as markers that
attach directly to a bare verb root, or a particular base form of a consonantal or
wa-class verb, with no intervening inflectional morphology.2 When an eviden-
   1
      Many other terms exist in the literature concerning concepts that are similar to epistemic as-
sessment. For example: Chafe’s (1986) broadly interpreted definition of ‘evidentiality’ as involving
“attitudes to knowledge” (1986:262); Lazard’s identification of the grammatical category of ‘me-
diativity’, concerning the expression of facts “through their [i.e., speakers’] acknowledgment of
the event” (1999:95); Weber’s (1986) ‘information perspective’, discussed in regard to Quecha val-
idational and evidential markers; and Mushin’s (2001) ‘epistemological stance’, defined as “the
speaker’s conceptualisation of information based on their construal of the nature and status of their
knowledge in the context of language use” (2001:81). I did not find an established term that was
entirely suitable to my description of Duna. For example, a problem with adopting Chafe’s broad
definition of ‘evidentiality’ is that it would cause some terminological confusion, as I use ‘eviden-
tiality’ in a (now more generally recognised) narrower sense, in reference to a particular group of
markers that encode information source as a primary meaning. Lazard’s ‘mediativity’ relates more
strictly to grammaticised rather than semantic categories, and in his discussion he is interested in dis-
tinguishing evidentiality from mediativity, which does not accord well with the Duna data. Weber’s
definition of ‘information perspective’ is tied quite specifically to Quechua morphology, and is not
easily transferred to another context. Mushin’s ‘epistmological stance’ is too multi-layered to be
articulated as a primary category in this preliminary descriptive work, which is most concerned
with identifying the meanings of individual morphemes, their relationships to each other, and their
formal and functional contexts of use. This thesis thus describes some of the linguistic resources
that a speaker has available for the expression of epistemological stance, including morphemes that
encode epistemic assessment.
    2
      Given the potential ancillary function of evidential and some information status markers
(Chapter 10), there is justification for analysing the consonantal or wa-class verb form to which
some evidential or information status markers attach as a productively inflected perfective stem,
rather than a predictably selected o-base (or u-base) form that does not independently contribute
aspectual meaning to the predication.
   For example, the information status marker -ra ‘SHRD’ attaches to the o-base of consonantal
verbs. The meaning of ‘SHRD’ is entirely compatible with perfective aspect, as it marks completed
past-time events. Thus, the form ngora, composed of the consonantal verb nga- ‘go’ and -ra ‘SHRD’
can be analysed in two ways. Under one analysis, -ra is an ancillary marker in a complex inflection,
being added to a verb that is inflected: ngo-ra is ‘go.PFV-SHRD’. Under another analysis, -ra is
a primary inflection that attaches to a predictable base form of consonantal verbs: ngo-ra is ‘go-
SHRD ’. I adopt the latter (‘primary inflection’) analysis when a certain (conventionalised) condition
is met. When an evidential or information status marker attaches to the o-base of a consonantal
verb to produce the same time, aspect, and epistemic assessment features as when it (or its formal
equivalent) attaches to a regular verb root or the i-base of a wa-class verb (and/or when the i-base
and u-base of a wa-class verb vary with no change in meaning) I do not treat this as a productively
9.2. Evidential markers                                                                             307
tial marker or information status marker occurs in a primary inflectional capacity,
it determines temporal features of the predicated activity in relation to the time
of utterance, indicating for example that the two are contemporaneous. As such,
these markers occupy the same formal slot and to some extent the same semantic-
functional domain of the TAM markers described in the previous chapter. Like
most TAM markers, evidential and information status markers do not grammaticise
‘tense’ as such, but supply an absolute time value as a derivative of other features;
for example, the interpretation of a predicated event as belonging to past time may
be a consequence of the kind of evidence a speaker has for it (see for example
§9.2.5).","[331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"

ally constructionally diverse but semantically coherent) system of immediate versus
deferred directives is well-attested in languages of the wider region. See: Franklin
(1971:39) on Kewa; Lang (1973:xxxvi) on Enga; May and Loeweke (1980:72) on
Fasu; Madden (MS:16) on Angal (Mendi); Rule (1977:55-8) on Huli, Foe, and Pole;
and Schieffelin (1986:567) on Kaluli.33 Pairs of immediate (‘strong’) and deferred
(‘weak’) command forms are found in Nambikuara (Mamainde), Brazil (Kroeker
2001:30-2), a language which is discussed in §9.2.2.2 in regard to its evidential sys-
tem. See also Shapiro (1989:88-90) concerning the deferred imperative in Hindi and
Bybee (1985:17-3) concerning languages with inflectional ‘delayed’ imperatives.
  33
     Interestingly this feature appears to coincide with evidential verbal morphology, and in at least
one case (Fasu) is analysed by the describers as representing an ‘in sight’ versus ‘out of sight’
distinction (May and Loeweke 1980:72). Time appears to be a more important feature than visibility
in the Duna case, but this issue warrants further investigation.

8.3     The negative circumfix
The negative circumfix na- -ya (NEG - - NEG) expresses negation on verbal predic-
ates. It is added to the a-base of consonantal verbs and the i-base of wa-class verbs.
Some uses of the negative circumfix were discussed in the previous chapter, which
describes how it is used differently in different kinds of complex predication. This
section describes this morpheme as it occurs both quasi-independently and in com-
bination with some of the TAM markers described in §8.2.","[327, 328, 329, 330]"

Interrogatives in Duna that do not contain an interrogative pro-form are commonly
structured as ‘alternative’ interrogatives which “provide a list from which, the speaker
suggests, the right answer might be drawn” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:179). Two
(or more) alternative scenarios are presented in the sentence. =Pe indicates there
is a choice to be made between these scenarios, and is felicitously represented in
English translation as ‘or’. Examples (1030) - (1032) show interrogatives in which
two alternatives of differing polarity are suggested. In (1030) - (1032) the positive
iteration of the predicate is placed first, inflected and further marked with =pe. The
negative iteration that follows is derived with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3),
and is not marked with =pe. This is typical of ‘alternative polarity’ interrogatives
in Duna (see also Giles MSa:L5). An appropriate answer (as shown in the b lines
of (1031) and (1032)) usually repeats part of the original question.

            ‘My father would tell pikono.’ (IV/KK-KY:KG05V3(2).7)    Alternative polarity interrogatives such as those shown in (1030) - (1032) are
functionally akin to ‘yes/no questions’ in that they ask, is something the case? How-
ever, the scenario of this something not being the case is made lexically explicit in
the utterance; these examples are thus similar to ‘disjunctive-negative’ structures
(König and Siemund 2007:297) that occur in languages such as Mandarin.
    Examples (1033) - (1035) show some further alternative interrogatives. These
do not offer two alternatives of differing polarity, but detail possible propositions
that ‘sketch’ (either more or less exhaustively) the semantic domain of the required
information. Answers are shown in the ‘b’ lines.(1033)    a. kei=pe,              ngoya?

tions. The form =pe is repeated as a semi-independent form in between the altern-
atives, functioning like a coordinating conjunction. This repeated semi-independent
use of =pe is common if the alternatives are contrasted but not really ‘parallel’ pro-
positions (that is, they differ according to several parameters, as in (1036)), or if
more than two alternatives are listed. See also (603) in §7.5.5.2.(1036)     oke, imanoa mbatia or say Kristian mbatia-ka, ha-me-ka                  ka

Interrogatives may alternatively be ‘question word’ interrogatives (Payne 1997) that
contain an interrogative pro-form (§3.9). The pro-form stands for information that is
missing from the speaker’s knowledge of the proposition, and which the addressee
is asked to supply (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:185). Some examples are shown in
(1037) - (1041). Interrogatives that contain pro-forms may be marked with =pe,
as in (1038) and (1039), or not, as in (1037), (1040), and (1041). I do not know
what factors motivate this alternation, but the presence of an interrogative pro-form
means the sentences are formally interrogative and inherently question-like in either
case.6(1037)     ko ai.

   6
     König and Siemund (2007:300) note that, although the application of an interrogative particle
would seem to be superfluous in constituent (question-word) interrogatives, it was nevertheless the
case that in approximately half of the languages they sampled, interrogative particles could option-
ally be added to constituent interrogatives.

           there-SPEC PSN=Q        there-SPEC who
         ‘Is that one Ambu, or who?’ (P/KY:KG05V3(2).2)11.1.3.6    Speculative sentences
Speculative sentences are those that are marked with -rape (UNC, §9.3.3.2), =koae
or =nokoae (HYP, §10.4.3). Speculative sentences are like interrogatives in that they
are always either include (a reflex of) the interrogative marker =pe and/or include an
interrogative pronoun. However, the interrogative marker is not really productively
applied. Removing pe (or replacing the interrogative pronoun with a noun) does
not result in a corresponding declarative or optative sentence. A speaker typically
uses speculative sentences as an invitation to an addressee to assess a proposition,
without necessarily expecting the addressee to be able to resolve the speaker’s ig-
norance or uncertainty concerning it. An example is shown in (1043).(1043)      a. Speaker A: Lepani Mospi ngo=koae=pe. Lepani hundi-ranua.
                            PSN      PLN      go.PFV=HYP=Q PSN   disappear-SNS . IMPL

              ‘He’s probably gone to Moresby.’ (CED/XIV:94)    Examples (1044) and (1045) show speculative sentences that follow the struc-
ture of alternative interrogatives.

         do not know.’ (T/PK:020104)11.1.4    Imperative and optative
The imperative sentence type generally “indicates the speaker’s desire to influence
future events” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:160) and the optative represents “an ex-
pression of the speaker’s wishes” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:164). I define imperat-
ive sentences in Duna as those headed by a predicate that is inflected as imperative
(§8.2.4.1), and optative sentences as those headed by a predicate that is inflected
as desiderative7 (§8.2.2.4), prohibitive (§8.2.4.2) or hortative (§8.2.4.3). Examples
of imperative and optative sentences are shown in the sections in Chapter 8 that
introduce the relevant morphemes.
    Imperative and optative sentences in Duna share a formal feature that unlike
(most) declaratives they cannot be marked with -na (SPEC) or =nia (ASSERT). Both
sentence types are typically directive in function, being used as requests or com-
mands to get other people to do (or not do) something. They are two distinct sen-
tence types in that optative sentences can be recast as interrogative sentences,8 but
imperatives cannot. Interrogatives formed from optative sentences typically func-
tion as a request for guidance from the addressee concerning the undertaking of a
predicate activity, and are exemplified in §11.2.4.2.
    There remain two TAM markers that, on a semantic and functional basis, are
included here as belonging to the larger notional imperative/optative group: the
‘warning against’ marker -wayeni (§8.2.4.4) and the ‘suggestion’ construction with
kone (§8.2.4.5). At present it is not possible to identify these as comprising distinct
types within the imperative/optative group or otherwise, but from a functional per-
spective sentences that are marked with these forms are directive, and thus more
like imperative and optative sentences than they are like any other kind of sentence.
I have found no examples of them being used in interrogative sentences, or being
marked with =nia or -na, and these possibilities have not been tested.
   7
      That is, when it occurs utterance finally as the only, and terminal, inflection, not when it is
followed by further ancillary morphology (§10.2.2.3) or is part of a complement structure.
    8
      I was first alerted to this possibility by Giles (MSa:L9).
11.1. Overview of sentence types                                                                 421
11.1.5    Assumptive
Assumptive sentences include those with predicates that are marked with certain in-
formation status markers: the shared standpoint morpheme -ra (§9.3.3.1), dramatic
markers (§9.3.3.3), and the provocative inflections (§9.3.4). I call sentences that
are marked with these morphemes ‘assumptive’ because they signal an assumption
the speaker is making concerning the addressee’s state of mind, and express the
speaker’s ‘take’ on the addressee’s epistemic relationship to this proposition.9 For
example, use of the expective marker (§9.3.4.2) signals a speaker’s assumption that
the addressee has failed to consider the situation denoted by the proposition.
    The illocutionary force of an assumptive sentence is complex. They function
somewhat like statements, in that they present the proposition as information that
is known to the speaker. However, each morpheme has further particular functional
characteristics. For example, the expective marker is typically used in obliquely
advising the addressee concerning a course of action, which relates to the function
of directive speech acts. The potential observation marker is typically used in trying
to extract information from the addressee, which relates to the function of questions.
    In keeping with this inherent functional multiplicity, the way certain assumptive
sentences fit in with an overall formal classification of sentence types is problematic.
As can be noted from Table 11.1, assumptive sentences are basically defined neg-
atively as those that do not show features typical of other identified sentence types.
They are grouped together as a collection of misfits that share some formal, func-
tional, and semantic commonalities, but it is not clear that they represent a unified
category of their own, and in some cases there is evidence to support classification
as belonging to another major sentence type.
    For example, the shared viewpoint marker -ra marks a proposition as somehow
familiar to both speaker and hearer. Such utterances are not typically informative,
as the speaker intimates that the addressee already has a pretty good idea of what
he or she is talking about, but they are assertive, and in this respect are similar to
declarative sentences. The shared viewpoint marker also appears to have a formal
property that is typical of declarative markers, the ability to be marked with the SPEC
marker -na. However, it is difficult to assess whether -ra shares the core property of
declarative markers, which is the ability to occur in interrogative sentences.
    The marker -ra does not occur productively with =pe in interrogative sentences,
but this combination is represented in the fused form -rape that occurs in speculative
sentences (§11.1.3.6), so there is not really a clear answer to this question. Further,
   9
     This is not to say that the use of other sentence types does not also involve making assumptions
about the addressee’s state of mind: this is a fairly essential tenet of talking to other people. How-
ever, assumptive sentences necessarily signify something quite particular about the nature of this
assumption, which is not generally the case for other sentence types.
422                                      Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
it is possible to use -ra in a question word interrogative that is not a real question,
but more of a (musing) attempt to recover once known but subsequently forgotten
information. For example, PK explained that the constructed sentence (1046) is
the sort of thing one might say to oneself having momentarily forgotten Kipu’s
destination, and that sentence (1047) would be used if the speaker had forgotten the
date of the addressee’s mother’s arrival and was asking to be reminded of it.","[445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451]"

7.3     Verb serialisation
7.3.1   Introduction
A prototypical serial verb construction (SVC) is generally defined as a clause that
includes two or more verb roots that describe closely connected (and sometimes
inseparable) events, occur in sequence as a mono-clausal unit with no overt marking
of dependency or conjunction, and match the intonation pattern of a single-verb
   6
     The kind of rhyming jingle that employs reduplication and vowel alternation (for example, Eng-
lish ‘criss-cross’) is classified by Pawley as ‘Type B’, in contrast to ‘Type A’ which employs con-
sonant alternation (for example, ‘helter-skelter’).
7.3. Verb serialisation                                                                       227
clause. The serialised verbs prototypically have at least one argument in common,
and share tense, aspect and polarity values (Foley and Olson 1985; Givón 1990;
Durie 1997; Pawley and Lane 1998; Kratochvil 2007).
    For Duna, I use the term ‘verb series’ (and related terms) to refer to sequences of
verb roots for which the final verb in the sequence (Vlast ) is inflected, bearing medial
or final verb morphology, and the other verbs in the sequence (Vn ) are uninflected.7
Regular Vn verbs are in bare root form, consonantal Vn verbs in their i-base form,
and wa-class Vn verbs may occur in either a-base or i-base form (§8.1.2).8 A basic
template for an SVC is represented in Figure 7.2. The ‘x’ designation is here used
to mean ‘number of subcategorised arguments’. That is, the template indicates that
the verbs together determine the argument structure of the clause, because the num-
ber of possible argument NPs matches the number of arguments that the complex
predicate (surrounded by angled brackets) specifies. The presence of the plus sign
indicates that the elements of the predicate are treated as comprising a single root,
for example in negation with the negative circumfix (§7.3.2.3).

    Some examples of two-verb serialisations are shown in text excerpt (482), the
relevant verbs shown in bold type. I have found series of up to three verb roots in
the textual data (§7.3.2.1). There is continuity of at least one argument (usually the
subject) across serialised verbs, and in all examples noted in natural text, serialised
verbs are immediately contiguous (§7.3.2.2). Serialised verbs can be negated with
the negative circumfix as a single unit, and circumfixal negation of only one verb in
the series is strongly dispreferred (§7.3.2.3).(482)     a. heka pi      koro        kuwa-rua.

   7
      Some sequences of verbs in which Vn are marked with the non-final inflections -ya ‘DEP’ or
-ta ‘SEQ’ can also be considered as comprising serialising constructions. I do not discuss these
constructions as they belong to the larger topic of dependent clause morphology and structures and
are outside the scope of this thesis.
    8
      Giles (MSa) describes most of the constructions that I term verb serialisation (and also verb
adjunct+verb combinations, see §7.4) as ‘compounding’. This is in many ways a sensible alternative
term, but I do not use it as the term ‘compound verb’ commonly implies a verb that is formed from
a verb root in combination with a defective verb or non-verb morpheme; see, for example, Trask
(1993), Aikhenvald (1999).

in sequence. These sentences are examples of time iconic SVCs as the activity that
happens first is presented first in the series. Other examples of this type, including
serialised verbs that describe overlapping as well as sequential activities, are shown
in §7.3.3.1. The subsequent sections also exemplify serialised verbs that: describe
events that have a purposive relationship (i.e., Vlast occurs in order that Vn may
take place) (§7.3.3.2); denote integrated activities or a single activity (§7.3.3.3); and
contribute aspectual or directional meaning to the predicate (§7.3.3.4).","[255, 256, 257]"

3.3    Verbs
Words that are members of a ‘verb’ class typically express actions, processes, and
states (Schachter and Shopen 2007:9; Evans 2000:712). A Duna verb typically
functions as the head of a clausal predicate, in which case the verb root must be
inflected (either medially or finally). The ordering of bound verbal morphology is
represented in Figure 3.1. Derivational affixes and directional demonstrative roots

occur in the ‘modifier’ position following the verb root (§7.2). The negative cir-
cumfix (§8.3) is applied to the (modified) stem, deriving a negative stem that can be
used as a medial or final verb or have inflectional morphology added to it (that is,
once the negative circumfix has been applied to a verb, further inflectional mark-
ing is possible but not strictly obligatory). With respect to final verbs, ‘inflectional
morphology’ includes tense, aspect, and event modality markers (§8.2), evidential
markers (§9.2), and information status markers (§9.3). Duna also has a range of
medial inflectional morphemes (not described in this thesis) that typically indicate a
time or aspect value with respect the following clause (for example if the predicated
activity is completed before the activity predicated in the following clause begins)
as well as signaling features concerning ‘cohesion’ (for example, if the identity of
the controlling argument changes from one clause to the next). In complex predic-
ations up to three verb roots can occur in series, with only the last verb of the series
bearing inflectional morphology (§7.3).

    Predicating verbs determine the argument structure of a clause (although see
also Chapter 7 concerning complex predication). I describe verbal roots in Duna
as monovalent (taking one argument), bivalent (taking two arguments) or trivalent
(taking three arguments). Monovalent, bivalent, and trivalent clause types are de-
scribed and exemplified in §4.1. Some verbal roots can take either one argument or
two arguments and I refer to these as ambivalent verbs (§4.2.3.4).
    There are three (partly cross-cutting) closed verb classes within the class of
verbs. Two of these are defined on the basis of shared morphological and distri-
butional characteristics. The third group, existential verbs, is defined through a
combination of formal and functional features.","[103, 104]"
"1.4    Thesis overview
This thesis describes certain structures of Duna grammar that are used in building
simple sentences, and looks in detail at some semantic themes that are encoded in
the bound morphemes of the language, particularly those that are to do with ex-
pressing attitudes to knowledge. It is an introduction to the language, and does not
present a comprehensive inventory of Duna grammatical morphemes and opera-
tions, or deal with complex sentence structures (for example, those involving clause
embedding or coordination).
    Chapter 2 provides an overview of Duna phonology, including a description of
the phonemic inventory and the major allophones of these phonemes, and a prelim-
inary statement concerning lexical tone in monomorphemic words. In Chapter 3, I
define Duna word classes as referred to in this thesis, and list the known members
of small closed classes. Chapter 4 presents an overview of major clause types and
features of basic clause structure.
    In Chapters 5 and 6, I examine the structure of nouns, nominal phrases (NPs),
place phrases (PlcPs), and postpositional phrases (PP), constituents that typically
occur to represent participants in the clause. This includes an account of morpholo-
1.4. Thesis overview                                                                27
gically complex nouns and the lexical structure of NPs (Ch. 5), and itemisation and
illustration of bound morphemes that indicate the epistemic positioning, number,
definiteness, grammatical function, semantic role, and/or prominence of the phrase
to which they are added (Ch. 6).
    In Chapters 7 to 11, I look in more detail at predicating constituents. Chapter
7 provides examples and discussion of certain complex predicate constructions, in-
cluding complex verbs, serialised verbs, and predicates that are composed of a verb
in combination with a free lexeme such as a noun or adjective.
    Chapter 8 begins my exploration of bound forms that occur on ‘final’ predicates.
Final predicates head an independent clause that constitutes a complete sentence
in itself, or occurs last in a chain of dependent clauses. Chapter 8 is concerned
with inflectional forms that occur on verbs, and indicate time, event modality, and
polarity features of the predicated activity, for example whether it is complete or
ongoing, or whether the speaker desires it to occur.
    In Chapter 9 I describe two groups of bound forms (evidential and information
status markers) that a speaker can use as final verb inflections to supply an epistemic
assessment of the proposition that is encoded in the utterance, as well as to supply
temporal information. Evidential markers typically indicate a source of information
(for example, whether the predicated activity was seen to occur), and information
status markers encode other kinds of attitudes towards the proposition (for example
as knowledge that is new or familiar).
    In Chapter 10, I illustrate complex final morphology constructions in which
evidential and information status markers are added following inflected verb forms
rather than bare roots, discuss the use of these forms in non-verbal clauses, and
introduce some further bound forms and constructions that are concerned in the
expression of epistemic assessment.
    Chapter 11 examines final predicate markers as described in Chapters 8 to 10
with respect to the sentence types of Duna, focussing on the way that certain forms
make different predictions about the relationship of the speaker to the proposition
in interrogative as opposed to non-interrogative sentences. In this last chapter I also
provide an overview of epistemic assessment and the final predicate in Duna.
Chapter 2Phonology
This chapter itemises the segmental phonemes of Duna and their major allophones,
and outlines some generalised phonological processes (§2.1). In §2.2 I describe
some aspects of contrastive lexical pitch, and §2.3 provides a key to the orthography
used in this thesis.","[55, 56, 57]"
"8.2.4.2    Prohibitive
The prohibitive suffix -wei occurs on regular verbs to tell an addressee to stop
doing something, or not begin an activity that it appears they are about to do.26 Two
examples are shown in (695) and (696).(695)     ka      no-ta       ke-wei.

          1SG 2SG.CS suppress-SEQ leave-PROHIB
          ‘Do not suppress and then abandon me.’ (T/SN:101203i)    The prohibitive suffix attaches to the o-base of consonantal verbs as shown
in (697) and (698).27 The semi-consonantal ra- ‘sit’ also uses the o-base for this
inflection, as shown in (699).
  25
      Comrie (2003) discusses the fact that full or partial suppletion of a verb ‘give’ with respect to
the person of the recipient is quite a widespread phenomenon in the world’s languages, even in those
languages that (like Duna) do not generally show any object or indirect object agreement on verb.
   26
      König and Siemund (2007:308-311) note that the presence of a prohibitive marker, that is, a
morpheme that is specific to negative directives and occurs on sentences that are not otherwise
marked as negative, is a comparatively infrequent phenomena cross-linguistically. Out of their
sample of 70 languages only four had special prohibitive morphology of this kind.
   27
      There is probably a phonological basis for this: Several inflections outlined in this section are
marked on regular verbs by suffixes that are not consonant-intial but start with a labialised and/or
rounded glide or vowel, probably derived from the initial bilabial of the verb wa- ‘do’. These suffixes
attach to the o-base of consonantal verbs, or alternatively appear in the surface form to be directly
affixed to the base consonant. The exception to this is the suffix wayeni, see §8.2.4.4, for which the
base form varies.

apparently with no difference in meaning. Giles (MSa:L2) reports similar variation.
An example of a wa-class verb with -wei attached to the u-base form is shown in

"7.3.2     Some general features of verb serialisation
7.3.2.1    Number of verbs in series
Duna verb serialisations typically include only two verb roots, and I have not found
more than three verbs occurring in series in the textual data. Two examples of three-
verb serialisations are shown in (483) and in the first clause of (484). These both
show a sequential followed by an overlapping temporal relationship: the subject
does something to an object and then relocates it. This is a typical pattern for three-
verb sequences in Duna.(483)     anene sa-ta      sei si      nga-ya...

          (WT/KK:060305)7.3.2.2    Contiguity
Serialised verbs as noted in the textual data are always contiguous. Interposing
an NP between the verbs was judged to be unacceptable, as shown in (485). This
contrasts with verbs that head medial clauses.
7.3. Verb serialisation                                                                        229

          I dug out peanuts and carried them below (CD/LSRVIII:180)    Interpolation of the time/manner terms ala ‘first’ and ha ‘hastily, immediately’
was also typically judged as unacceptable, as shown in (486) and (487). This con-
trasts with medial clauses and other complex predications such as verb adjunct con-
structions (with respect to ha only, see §7.4.2.1).(486)     a. no puri ala rei          nganda.

               * [I] will go straight away and eat (CD/VIII:155)7.3.2.3    Negation
It is a feature of serialised verbs (as opposed to most other complex predicate con-
structions) that they are typically negated as a single constituent, the negative cir-
cumfix na- -ya (NEG–NEG, §8.3) surrounding the verb roots as in (488).9 Example
(489) shows a three-verb serialisation that is negated in this way. Example (490)
shows a negated purposive serialisation and (491) a negated ‘integrated activity’
serialisation. (See also §8.3.3 concerning an alternative negation strategy that can
be used with serialised verbs.)(488)     na      na-si      nga-ya.

     (Giles MSa:L2)) also makes a point of noting that serial verbs are generally negated as a unit,
not individually.

This sentence was considered interpretable but odd, and I have not found any tex-
tual examples that follow this pattern so it is clearly dispreferred. The meaning is
apparently the same as for unitary negation, that is, negation still applies to both
verbs.","[257, 258, 259]"

structures laid out in Table 7.1. However, many also show particular non-predictable
characteristics, relating for example to morphological composition, argument struc-
ture, or degree of lexicalisation. Some complex predications (particularly examples
of those structures that include a nominal) are idiomatic, comprising a convential-
ised expression the meaning of which cannot be predicted from knowledge of the                                           218
7.1. Introduction                                                                  219
constiutents as they occur in isolation from each other (Nunberg et al. 1994:492).
    In the first four sections of this chapter I proceed from complex predicates in
which the morphemic components are highly bound (for example, as a unitary stem
that cannot be separated) to those more idiomatic constructions in which the com-
ponents are free lexemes or phrases that are semantically rather than formally inter-
dependent.
    Section 7.2 describes the derivation of complex verbs through the addition of
a directional demonstrative root, bound aspectual/adverbial form, or participant-
adding morpheme. Sections 7.3 - 7.5 define three major types of complex predicate
construction with reference to the word class of the constituent that occurs in addi-
tion to a clause-final verb.
    In §7.3, I examine predicates that are composed of two or three verbs in series,
with an uninflected verb (or verbs) preceding an inflected verb. Typically verbs in
series must be contiguous, and the preferred method of negation with the negative
circumfix (§8.3) is ‘unitary’, that is, with the circumfix surrounding the whole series
as a single stem. Some verbs in series describe distinct activities; some are lexic-
alised to refer to a single activity that is not necessarily predictable from the mean-
ing of the individual verb roots; and some occur in ‘asymmetrical’ constructions
(Aikhenvald 2006) in which the last verb in the series aspectually or directionally
modifies the preceding verb.
    Section 7.4 concerns predicates that are composed of a verb in combination
with a ‘verb adjunct’ (§3.4). Both constituents can contribute to the meaning and
argument structure of the predicate. A verb adjunct typically immediately precedes
its host verb, and interposed constituents are generally dispreferred. The negative
circumfix can be applied either to the verb only, or to the verb adjunct + verb com-
bination as a whole.
    Complex predicates where a verb combines with a noun or NP are examined in
§7.5. The negative circumfix is not applied to the expression as a whole, but occurs
on the verb root only. The nominal element may be introduced into a clause in which
there is no argument slot for it to occupy (occurring as an ‘adjunct noun’), or occur
with a multivalent verb for which it can be posited as an object NP in what I term
an ‘object-verb predication’. Typically the nominal element is a non-referential and
unmodified common noun, and subject to an ordering restriction that it must follow
other NPs, PPs, or PlcPs in the clause, but some variation in regard to these features
is allowable.
    Section 7.5 describes some further families of minor constructions that consist
of an NP or adjective in combination with the existential verb ka- ‘be/stand’. It also
discusses some special predicating structures that include existential verbs and are

concerned with the expression of possession and proper inclusion.
    Section 7.6 looks at complex predicates that describe involuntary experience.
These represent a variety of construction types that are related but not identical
to some of those described in §7.3 - §7.5, and are grouped together on a largely
semantic basis.","[247, 248, 249]"

7.4.2     General features of verb adjunct constructions
7.4.2.1    Contiguity
As with serialised verbs (§7.3.2.2), there is a strong preference for contiguity of
the predicate constituents in verb adjunct constructions. In the textual data verb
adjuncts typically immediately precede their host verb. However, in constructed
sentences verb adjunct constructions are somewhat less restricted than serialised
verbs with regard to the acceptability of interposed constituents.
   As with serialised verbs, the insertion of the modifier ala ‘first’ between the
predicate constituents was generally judged to be unacceptable, as shown in (518)
and (519).(518)     a. ko mbuku ala iri             ma.
              2SG book      first fetch go.IMP

                1SG.CS finish first be/put.PFV
              * First I finished it (CD/XIV:76)     However, the pre-verbal modifier ha ‘already, quickly’ was generally judged
acceptable preceding either the verb adjunct or the host verbs as illustrated in (520)
and (521). This contrasts with verb serialisation, in which ha should precede the
first predicating element.(520)     a. ha     iri    ma.

          b. iri    ha     ma.

Verb adjunct constructions can be negated by applying the negative circumfix na-

applying the negative circumfix to the verb only, as in (523a) (see also (531)).","[265, 266, 267]"

“making announcements, stating conclusions, making claims, relating stories, and
so on” (1985:160). The declarative sentence type is most typically associated with
utterances that are statements, having propositional content that the speaker com-
municates to the addressee.
    As shown in Table 11.2, final predicate markers that I define as occurring in
declarative sentences1 include: TAM markers as described in §8.2.2.1 to 8.2.2.3,
§8.2.3 and §8.3; evidential markers (§9.2); the individual standpoint marker -pa;
specificity marker -na; and the epistemic particles =pi and =pakapi. Most of the
examples shown in the sections that introduce the relevant morphemes are declar-
ative sentences. Sentences headed by non-verbal predicates (either unmarked or
marked with one of the morphemes listed) are also declaratives.
    It is a core property of Duna declarative sentences that they can be derived as
interrogatives, for example, through the addition of the interrogative marker =pe;
sentences which typically function to communicate substantive content can be trans-
formed into sentences that seek (part of) the same content from somebody else.
    A further typical (but not universal) property of predicate morphemes that occur
in declarative sentences is that in situations of emphasis they are compatible with
either the SPEC marker -na (§10.2.2, §10.2.4) or the assertion marker =nia. This is
true of all of the relevant TAM markers, the personal evidential markers, and the
relevant epistemic particles.211.1.2.1     Assertion marker =nia
The bound form =nia (ASSERT) occurs finally on declarative sentences and marks
an utterance as an assertion.
   Examples (1016) and (1017) show the assertion marker occurring on non-verbal
predicates.(1016)     no ima=nia.
           1SG woman=ASSERT
         ‘I am a woman.’ (T/YS:270205)
   1
      Note that with regard to complex predicate morphology, it is the last morpheme in the sequence
that is relevant to this definition.
    2
      In the case of the individual standpoint marker -pa the situation in regard to this feature is not
clear (§10.2.4.4). Concerning the quasi-inflectional occurrence of the SPEC marker on independent
verbal clauses (§9.3.2.2), such verb forms are not further marked with =nia, and the question of
whether they are ‘compatible with SPEC’ is problematic; this would amount to asking if a morpheme
can be applied twice, something which has not been observed as allowable in any other area of the
grammar. Finally, the impersonal evidentials: these forms have something of a semantic/functional
incompatibility with either -na or =nia. The SPEC marker implies that the predicate refers to a highly
specific and individuated occasion, which clashes somewhat with the generalised and unanchored
perception denoted by the personal evidentials. Similarly, the assertion marker =nia basically marks
the speaker as an epistemic authority, and this is also at odds with the non-specific perceiver evoked
by the impersonal markers.

         ‘Your body decoration is very good.’ (CD/VIII:118)    Examples (1018) - (1022) show the assertion marker occurring on verbal pre-
dicates. The assertion marker can be added to a limited subset of predicate markers,
including the perfective, intentive, prophetic, habitual, abilitative and promissive
TAM markers. It does not occur following evidential or information status markers,
or on the stative or imperfective inflections.3(1018) ta ha-na               ruka-tia-ni,                no na-riya-ya-nda=nia.

     The distribution of =nia on final verbs is thus nearly complementary with that of the specificity
marker -na. The nature of this distribution suggests the emergence (or subsidence) of a grammat-
icised realis/irrealis mood opposition in declarative sentences whereby emphatic assertion is indic-
ated with -na in the realis category and =nia in the irrealis category.

stemic authority in regard to the proposition. The marker is not strictly obligatory,
but there are certain circumstances in which it is expected. For example, in elicited
or constructed answers to questions (in which the predicate was inflected with a
compatible morpheme), speakers consistently judged that a sentence sounded bet-
ter with =nia than without.","[439, 440, 441, 442, 443]"
"8.1.1     Overview of final predicate morphology
8.1.1.1    The basic morphological template
My approach to the broad topic of final predicate morphology in Duna assumes the
general template shown in Figure 8.1.1 Two positions are specified, the primary
inflectional position (which is only relevant to verbal clauses), and the ancillary
position (which is relevant to both verbal and non-verbal clauses).
    A primary inflection is an obligatory component of a final verbal predicate, and
establishes certain features of the predicated event in regard to its actualisation and
temporal status, for example, whether it is potential, completed, or ongoing. This
and the following chapter are concerned with morphemes that are used as primary
inflections.

     ‘Adjv ’ refers to those adjectival roots that typically show distributional properties of verbs, and
can occur with TAM markers and the negative circumfix (§3.5). ‘Adjn ’ refers to those adjectival roots
that are more nominal in nature, and do not occur with TAM markers or the negative circumfix.",[296]
"8.2.4.3    Hortative
The hortative inflection is used for exhortations concerning activities the speaker
wants to start immediately and in company with the addressee(s).
   With regular verbs, the suffix -wae (often realised as [we]) is added to the root.
Two examples are shown in (701) and (702).(701)     kena-ka iwake          kali-wae.

          1/2PL all     eat-EXHAUST-HORT
          ‘Let’s all eat it all.’ (ED/V:102)    Consonantal verbs have a hortative form that corresponds to their base con-
sonant followed by wae, (which orthographic convention generally converts to the
standard representation oae). As seen in (703), these are glossed as unsegment-
able forms. The hortative form of wa- ‘have, do’ is wae, that is, it is not possible
to distinguish ‘consonant base’ from ‘suffix’ at all, as the adjacent glide segments
apparently simplify to a single glide.28
  28
    This form suggests an origin for the regular suffix, and relates to analysis of the imperative -pa
as being derived from the imperative form of ‘do, have’.

         ‘ Let’s us two break off sticks [he] said.’ (T/KP:070104iii)    The hortative inflection can also be used with non speaker/addressee subjects,
as in (706) - (708).(706)    ipa roro-wae.

clauses (see for example (500)) are homophonous with the hortative final inflec-
tion.30 The hortative can also be used with the interrogative =pe (and a speaker
subject) as a request for permission, see §11.2.4.
  29
     The hortative form could reflect a concatenation of a (now non-productive) sequence ...(w)a-
wae.

8.2.4.4    Warning against
On regular verbs, the form wayeni (WARN) occurs following the root to express
a warning against the predicate activity, intimating that there will be bad con-
sequences if the event occurs. As pointed out by Giles (MSa:L4), this functions
like a negative command for non-immediate actions (see §8.2.4.6). Two examples
are shown in (709) and (710).(709)     hiwa-na=nia,                ko ke-wayeni ru     ri-na.

          ‘That one only, you must not dig out.’ (T/JK:KG05V5.27)     For consonantal verbs, there is variation as to whether: -yeni follows the a-
base, as in (711) and (712b); -wayeni occurs following the imperfective stem, as in
(712a); or -wayeni is added to the o-base, as in (712c). In some cases wayeni is
reduced to [waj ni] or [waE ni]. Further data and analysis are needed to determine the
contrastive structural relationships, semantics, and/or functions of these possibilit-
ies.(711)     para ka-yeni.

the i-base, as in (713).(713)     ayu mbitini-ka     ri-ya,    rama eke si-wayeni.

    The WARN marker can also used as a more polite alternative to the prohibitive
inflection.
    Wayeni can be used to mark a sentence in a (paratactically) coordinate structure
that expresses negative purpose.31 The activity described by the one sentence is
performed so that the situation described by the wayeni sentence does not arise, as
in (714) - (716). In such cases the subject of the wayeni clause may be third person.(714)     ko wei-ta        khene-wayeni, ke-ta          ka-no.

          ‘Look after [the pig] well, lest it should die.’ (ED/XIV:144)8.2.4.5    Suggestions with kone
The form kone occurs on final predications following verbs that are marked with the
intentive or hortative inflections. This construction (V-INT / HORT + KONE) marks
utterances that suggest what can, should, or may be done.32 The intentive is used
with inclusive or addressee subjects, and the hortative with third person subjects.
The morpheme kone is as yet poorly understood (for example, its precise distribu-
tion is not known), and it seems to be a lone player rather than belonging to a set
of contrastive forms. This construction is included here on functional grounds even
though it is not strictly inflectional. Some examples are shown in (717)-(719).(717)     inu     sopa Tomas kei-ta                     Mamsa-nda nga-nda kone.

  31
     This was brought to my attention by Giles (MSa:L30)
  32
     I have used ‘should’ in translating all of the examples here for the sake of consistency but as far
as I know ‘can’, ‘could’, ‘shall’, ‘may’ etc would be equally appropriate.
298             Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
    Giles (MSa) observes that kone also occurs with -nda and -wae in purpose
clauses. An example is shown in (720). I found only a few occurrences of this
structure in the 2003-7 data (one example can be seen in (362)).","[323, 324, 325, 326, 327]"

    TAM markers encode features of the predicated event in relation to time and
event modality. Time features include those that are related to the category of as-
pect (“the internal temporal constituency of a situation”, Comrie (1976:3)) and to
the category of tense (relating the time of the event with respect to the time of utter-
ance.6 ‘Event modality’ is defined by Palmer (2001:8) as the modal category which
refers to “events that are not actualised, events that have not taken place but are
merely potential”.7 Inflections that encode event modality meanings are concerned
in expressing an attitude towards the actualisation of a potential event; for example,
saying that it can or should (or shouldn’t) take place. Palmer divides event modal-
ity into two main types, the ‘dynamic’ and ‘deontic’. Dynamic mode is typically
concerned with ‘internal’ properties (generally properties of the subject) such as
ability and intention, and deontic mode is more to do with ‘external’ conditioning
factors such as obligation and permission (Palmer 2001:9). This distinction relates
somewhat to the division of ‘participant-internal modality’ and ‘participant-external
   6
      Some of the inflections have additional meanings and functions that are relevant to broader topic
of ‘epistemic assessment’, discussed in the following three chapters. These meanings are stated here,
but discussion of them is kept to a minimum until the relevant features have been presented in more
detail with regard to other predicate morphology.
    7
      Palmer contrasts event modality with propositional modality, which is to some extent the do-
main of the Duna bound morphemes described in Chapters 9 and 10.
278            Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
modality’ proposed by van der Auwera and Plungian (1998).8
    Semi-finite inflections (§8.2.2), comprise a set of four morphological operations,
two of which encode aspect values and two of which encode event modality values.
These can occur as the only inflection of an independent clause, or derive stems that
can be combined with ancillary predicate morphology, including evidential markers,
information status markers, and epistemic particles; see Chapter 10.9
    Sections 8.2.3 and 8.2.4 describe finite final verb inflections, those that derive
a bounded proposition in terms of actualisation, temporal features, and/or the il-
locutionary force of the utterance, marking “structural independence at the highest
possible level of sentencehood” (Bisang 2007:137). Section 8.2.3 details inflections
that occur in declarative (or, by extension, interrogative) sentences. Two of these
inflections, the habitual and stative, are used in reference to an actual situation, and
mark time features of these situations. The other three inflections are used in ref-
erence to non-actual events. These have quite specific or complex meanings, for
example the promissive inflection -wei indicates that the speaker makes a promise
or accepts an obligation regarding a future action. At least some finite declarat-
ive inflections can be used in limited combination with certain ancillary markers,
although this is uncommon (§10.2.3.3).
    In §8.2.4 I describe a group of final verb markers that occur in non-declarative
sentences (marking imperative, optative, and some other minor sentence types, see
§11.1). Some of these are not strictly inflectional forms as they are constructional, or
are added to derived verb stems rather than bare root forms; I include such markers
in this section on functional/semantic grounds. The markers described in §8.2.4
usually occur in directive speech acts (for example, commands, prohibitions) where
the speaker tries to get other people to do (or not do) things. The core meanings
of these forms are deontic, expressing “the imposition of an expressed world on
a reference world” (Frawley 1992:420).10 Time reference (immediate or deferred
time, see §8.2.4.6) is also either encoded or implied as part of their meaning. Finite
non-declarative TAM markers do not occur in combination with ancillary markers
   8
      The match is not exact. For one thing, the essential definition of modality in van der Auwera
and Plungian (1998) concerns the opposition of necessity and possibility; thus, participant-internal
modality has to do with internal possibility (for example, ability) or internal necessity (need), and
does not incorporate intention. Additionally, participant-external modality is treated as a domain
that contains deontic modality, rather than as a way to define it. However, van der Auwera and
Plungian’s and Palmer’s ‘deontic’ categories do end up being roughly equivalent, as under both
models the major concerns of deontic modality are obligation (deontic necessity) and permission
(deontic possibility).
    9
      I call these inflections semi-finite because they do not necessarily determine temporal and actu-
alisation features of the predicated event in absolute terms; if they are followed by an ancillary, their
meanings are typically construed as relative to the ancillary, rather than independently.
   10
      We can say that in contrast to this, markers that are typically used in statements are concerned
in the exposition of the reference world as an expressed world.
8.2. Tense, aspect and event modality (TAM)                                              279
and are thus ‘terminal’ inflections.
    TAM markers can be grouped together in a number of alternative ways which
cut across the three groups as presented in §8.2.2 - §8.2.4. Different semantic, func-
tional, and formal features of the morphemes compel different articulations of how
they relate to each other. For example, it makes sense to identify TAM markers
that are used in the description of actualised rather than potential events as a dis-
crete group that encodes aspect as the primary organisational parameter, and this is
outlined in §8.2.3.7.
    Duna verbs are not marked with pronominal agreement affixes,11 and TAM
markers do not mark person as such (that is, they do not alternate strictly according
to the number and person of certain clausal arguments). However, certain (declarat-
ive) TAM markers have a distributional pattern that correlates with subject identity,
and this pattern generally follows ‘conjunct/disjunct’ alignment (§11.2.1.1). The
Duna intentive inflection (§8.2.2.3), promissive inflection (§8.2.3.5), and the special
present inflection of the verb nga- ‘go’ (§8.2.3.6) typically occur with speaker sub-
jects in declarative sentences and addressee subjects in questions (show conjunct
distribution). The prophetic inflection (§8.2.3.3) typically occurs with non-speaker
subjects in declarative sentences and non-addressee subjects in interrogative sen-
tences (shows disjunct distribution).
    The conjunct/disjunct pattern is generally concerned with the relationship between
a participant (most commonly S or A) of a verbal clause and the person in the ut-
terance situation who is the epistemic source (Hargreaves 2005) with regard to the
proposition. For example, it is typically sensitive to whether the person in the speech
situation who has (best access to) knowledge of the described event also figures as
an agentive participant in it. The nature and implications of this distributional pat-
tern in Duna are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11. For the time-being I focus
in the main on the basic meanings of these TAM markers in declarative sentences,
although a few interrogative examples are also introduced.
    Because of the significance of the conjunct/disjunct distributional pattern to
Duna grammar, it is useful to have a quasi-‘person’ term (additional to and cut-
ting across the grammatical categories of first, second, and third person encoded in
the Duna personal pronouns) that refers to the speaker of a declarative sentence, and
the addressee of an interrogative sentence. I use the term ‘informant’ for this kind
of person, following Bickel (2001) (as reported in Bickel and Nichols 2007). Note,
however, that my use of the term informant is not identical to that of Bickel, who
defines informant functionally as “the person whom the speaker supposes or claims  11
   Foley (2000:377) notes that a lack of such affixes is “relatively uncommon” in languages of
New Guinea.
280            Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation
to be the immediate supplier of the information” (Bickel and Nichols 2007:223), and
with respect to different kinds of speech acts (that is, the informant is the speaker
in statements, the addressee in questions, Bickel 2007:2). My definition is tied to
formal sentence types of Duna (at this stage, declarative and interrogative) rather
than being completely functional.
    One other obvious way in which subject identity is relevant to verbal inflection
is in the context of directive inflections. For example, verbs that are inflected as
imperative have an addressee subject by pragmatic necessity. Imperative sentences
usually occur as commands, and the imperative inflection is not used in interrogative
sentences, so a conjunct/disjunct pattern is not observable. However, the desider-
ative (§8.2.2.4), prohibitive (§8.2.4.2), and hortative (§8.2.4.3) inflections occur in
optative sentences (§11.1), which can be transformed into interrogatives (for ex-
ample, with the addition of the interrogative marker =pe, §11.1.3.2). In these cases
we again see an alternation in correlations concerning subject identity that are de-
pendent on sentence type, with the markers generally showing disjunct-like distri-
bution. This is illustrated in §11.2.4; in this chapter I only discuss the use of these
markers in directive utterances and do not exemplify their use in questions.","[306, 307, 308, 309]"

336                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
9.2.9    The perfective TAM marker revisitedAs can be seen in Table 9.4, the majority of evidential markers are used as primary
inflections in declarative (or interrogative) sentences that describe past time events.
In this respect, they are in contrast with the perfective TAM inflection described
in §8.2.2.1. This raises the question of whether the perfective inflection, like the
morphemes to which it is opposed, itself encodes an information source value; is it
really just marking a temporal feature, or does it also say something in particular
about evidence?
    Two additional information source types that are of particular relevance to this
issue are the ‘participatory’ (also termed ‘performative’) and ‘factual’, because
these are the kinds of evidence that the perfective might reasonably encode.31 Par-
ticipatory information source relates to situations in which the speaker is actively
involved in the event described, and knows of it as a participant.32 Factual inform-
ation source relates to “actions or states which have been observed enough by the
speaker for him to generalize them as true and [...] which are simply common
knowledge” (Oswalt 1986:36).
    The construal of factual and participatory semantics as a distinct category or
categories within an evidential system is a feature of languages such as Kashaya
(Oswalt 1986) and Central Pomo (Mithun 1999) of the Pomo family, northern Cali-
fornia, and, closer to home, Oksapmin (Loughnane 2007; forthcoming) and Foe
(Rule 1977). In Central Pomo for example, one of a set of seven enclitics is nor-
mally added to an inflected verb to indicate information source. Categories distin-
guished in this evidential system include ‘general knowledge’ (factual) and ‘per-
sonal experience of one’s own action’ (participatory), as well as those that encode
more canonical information source types such as hearsay, inference, and auditory
evidence (Mithun 1999:181).
    In Foe and Oksapmin evidentiality is an obligatory verbal inflectional category
in at least some areas of the grammar (for example, indicative past tense forms). By
this, I mean that the encoding of information source can be identified as a requisite
component in the grammatical system: in certain kinds of sentences, a speaker must
choose not whether, but which kind of, evidence is specified. In Foe and Oksapmin,
verbal inflections that make reference to features such as visual or other sensory ob-
servation are formally contrasted with an inflection that makes reference to factual
and participatory meaning; participatory/factual semantics are grammaticised as an  31
      Aikhenvald (2004) and Willett (1988) do not generally recognise participatory or factual mean-
ing as being relevant to evidential systems cross-linguistically.
   32
      Compare Oswalt’s definition of the performative in Kashaya: “the speaker knows of what he
speaks because he is performing the action himself or has just performed it” (1986:34).
9.2. Evidential markers                                                                               337
evidential category.33
     The kinds of evidential systems outlined above thus suggest a particular ques-
tion concerning the Duna perfective inflection, namely, whether it is a semantic-
ally complex form that specifies both time and information source, and represents
a participatory and/or factual evidential category.34 If it were, this would allow an
analysis that evidentiality is an obligatorily marked category within a certain area of
Duna grammar (declarative sentences that denote past time events). However, while
it seems very likely that the perfective inflection at least implies participatory/factual
semantics as a consequence of contrast with other possible primary inflections, at
this stage there is insufficient evidence to claim that it actively encodes information
source and is itself an evidential marker.
    In languages in which participatory and/or factual evidential markers occur, they
are members of a closed set of mutually exclusive morphemes that have information
source as a primary meaning. That is, there are compelling categorical reasons, as
well as semantic and functional motivations, to treat the markers in question as
evidential.
    This is not so in the Duna case, as there are clear indications that while the per-
fective inflection contrasts with each evidential marker, it is not part of the same
formal set. As has already been mentioned, the perfective inflection has much more
restricted distribution than evidential markers, as it only occurs as a primary in-
flection on verbal predicates, whereas evidentials can occur as ancillary markers
with verbs (§10.2.3), and most can mark nominal predicates (§10.3). The evidential
markers as identified in §9.2 comprise a mutually exclusive set of forms that cannot
co-occur; however, many of them are attested occurring in combination with the per-
fective inflection (§10.2.2.5). Verbs that are inflected as perfective are commonly
further marked with epistemic particles (§10.4), whereas verbs that are inflected
with evidential markers typically are not, and in some cases are barred from doing
so (§10.4.2). A further significant point concerns the application of the assertion
  33
      In the Oksapmin case, as described by Loughnane (2007), the participatory/factual evidential
is zero-marked in some person/aspect categories, and is also the inflection that can be most widely
used in more complex morphological structures. For example, a preverbal particle that encodes
inference can be used with a verb that bears a participatory/factual inflection, in which case the
information source meaning of this inflection is bleached. Thus, the participatory/factual forms are
the functionally unmarked way of expressing past tense in the grammar. Nevertheless, as argued by
Loughnane (2007), in view of the paradigmatic formal opposition displayed and contexts in which
the independent inflection is appropriate, the most sensible interpretation is that verbal markers
comprise a distinct evidential category—the participatory/factual—in these languages.
   34
      One alternative analysis would be to posit a ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential marker. How-
ever this would not add anything to the present discussion, which is concerned with markers that can
occur as primary inflections. Such a morpheme would have to be defined as a marker that can only
occur in an ancillary capacity (Chapter 10), as it is not the case that a verb can occur as a final predic-
ate in (apparent) bare root form, inflected with the postulated ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential
only.
338                                 Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
marker =nia (§11.1.2.1), which marks certain kinds of declarative sentences. This
form is not applied to verbal clauses following evidential markers, but is commonly
added following the perfective inflection.
    Additionally, there are some problems with saying that the perfective TAM
inflection contrasts exclusively with evidential markers, because certain informa-
tion status markers are also available for use as primary inflections in describing
past time events (§9.3.3, §9.3.4.3). These morphemes are also (at least margin-
ally) present in the overall ‘past time’ group as contrastive forms (Table 8.2), and
this makes the proposal that the perfective inflection marks a specifically evidential
value less compelling.
    We must therefore look mainly at contexts of use to examine whether the per-
fective inflection encodes participatory/factual semantics, and at the current time it
is not clear that this is the case. Further analysis and data are required to investigate
a) the presence and strength of a correlation between use of the perfective inflection
and participatory/factual meaning; and b) whether any such meanings can be con-
vincingly distinguished from those that might arise through a situation of ‘default’
use, where the perfective inflection is an unspecified form that implies epistemic
assessment values by dint of contrast only, rather than positive specification.35
    In sum, I find that there is not a strong case for defining the perfective TAM
marker as a morpheme that actively encodes information source. However, because
most of the morphemes to which it is opposed specify particular kinds of non-
participatory information source, this inflection is likely to at least imply a speaker’s
involvement with the event that is so described, and/or their understanding of it as
  35
     For example, it is possible to make a general observation that verbs in the textual data which
denote events in which the speaker was personally involved as an active participant (for example, in
clauses with a speaker subject) are usually inflected as perfective (and are not followed by further
markers of epistemic assessment). However, this could just as easily be a consequence of the fact
that evidential markers are rarely appropriate to speaker subjects in statements (§11.2.2), rather than
reflecting the fact that the perfective inflection is inherently participatory in meaning.
   Similarly, while the perfective inflection is quite commonly used in those histories which can be
posited as representing as general ‘facts’ or common knowledge (for example, the narrative concern-
ing the origin of Lake Kopiago), there are also myriad examples in the textual data of the perfective
occurring as an independent inflection on sentences describing events that the speaker would not
claim to have been directly involved in, and would not claim to be general factual knowledge (for
example one-off ‘made up’ stories with imaginary characters). There are several competing conclu-
sions that could reasonably be drawn from such use. One is to say that the perfective inflection is
completely neutral in regard to epistemic assessment features and anybody can use it anytime about
anything, with no concomittant evidential or validational (etc.) effects. Another is to say that it does
specify a participatory/factual evidential value, but that this is construed from the point of view of
characters within the narrative, as other evidentials are. A further option is to say that the perfective
inflection, although not positively specified, typically implies factualness, participation, etc, but that
this can be construed within the larger frame of the narrative (cf. Lidz 2007). That is, it is not spe-
cifically encoding a personal viewpoint, but can be understood to be functionally unmarked in the
context of the story-world, rather than in the actual world. This latter interpretation seems the most
convincing to me.

§9.2.8. Some of these forms can occur in combination with certain TAM markers
and/or evidential markers; see Chapter 10.","[363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368]"

Abstract
This thesis is an introduction to Duna, a language spoken by approximately 25,000
people living in Southern Highlands Province in Papua New Guinea. Duna (also
known as Yuna) is classified as a member of the Duna-Bogaya subgroup of the Trans
New Guinea family. This study is primarily based on work with Duna speakers of
the Lake Kopiago region.
     The thesis provides a basic treatment of phonology, describes the structure of
simple sentences, and examines in detail the expression of epistemic assessment
(the treatment of a proposition as representing knowledge), a semantic domain that
is richly encoded by bound morphemes in the language.
     Chapter 1 gives background information concerning the Duna lands, people,
and language situation. It also describes previous work that has been done on the
language, and the nature and sources of the data used in this study.
     Chapter 2 includes an overview of Duna segmental phonology and gives an
account of citation tone contrasts in monomorphemic words.
     Chapter 3 outlines Duna word classes, including large open lexical classes such
as nouns, and smaller closed grammatical classes such as demonstratives.
     Chapter 4 deals with the structure of the basic clause, describing the different
clause types and outlining dominant and pragmatically marked word orders.
     Nouns and NP structure are treated in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 details NP marking
that encodes epistemic positioning, specificity, pairhood, grouphood, semantic role,
grammatical relation, and discourse or pragmatic prominence.
     Chapter 7 analyses complex predicates, for example, those that are composed
of a verb and a verb adjunct, or of several verbs in series.
     The remainder of the thesis focusses on bound morphemes that are added to
the predicate of a final clause. Chapter 8 treats markers which specify features
of the denoted situation in terms of time or event modality. Chapters 9 and 10
describe evidential markers, information status markers, and epistemic particles,
morphemes which attach to a final predicate to express an epistemic assessment of
the proposition.
     Chapter 11 describes the formal and functional features of Duna sentence types
and discusses typical implications that certain predicate markers have concerning a
speaker’s or addressee’s relationship to the denoted situation.

Acknowledgements
Many Duna people in the Lake Kopiago area and in Mount Hagen (Western High-
lands Province) have contributed language material and discussion to this work. I
thank them wholeheartedly for their essential part in this study, as well as their ex-
cellent company. Kenny Kendoli, Petros Kilapa, Kipu Piero and Richard Alo in
particular translated and discussed their language with humour, patience, tenacity,
thoughtfulness, and insight. Richard, you were taken from us too soon, and I con-
tinue to honour your great courage, intelligence, and compassion.
    Whilst at Lake Kopiago I was very lucky to be able to record texts from the late
Sane Noma and Raki Patako, and from Pastor Hagini Yami, three senior Duna men
of extraordinary wisdom and spirit. Special thanks also to Kipu, Metai Heri, Haya
Suku, Monica Kenny and Metina Kali for the hard work they put into conversing
with a learner of their language.
    In the field I was based at an ANU research house in Rewapi (Hirane parish),
next door to Kenny and Kipu and their family members. Many thanks to them
for putting up with the extra disruption and responsibilities that this entailed, and
to other members of the Rewapi/Hirane and wider Lake Kopiago community who
were so welcoming and kind. I hope to find some way to repay you.
    In writing this thesis I have been privileged to be under the tutelage of my su-
pervisors Andrew Pawley and Alan Rumsey of the Research School of Pacific and
Asian Studies. Andy whipped the bulk of my early chapter drafts into shape, and de-
voted much time and effort to his careful reading of a near-final draft of the thesis.
His stringent and perspicuous advice has been of immense value to me at every
stage of the writing process. Alan Rumsey has conscientiously read even my most
off-the-rail writings, and consistently offered wise and sensitive feedback. He has
helped me to battle with some difficult organisational problems, and been encour-
aging and engaged throughout.
    My advisor Malcolm Ross contributed significantly to a reworking of Chapters
1-7 with his thoughtful, precise, and clear-sighted comments. Nicholas Evans got
stuck into Chapters 8-11 with enthusiasm and incisiveness. I enjoyed our discus-
sions and arguments very much, and they were very important in helping me revise
the thesis.
    I began my studies at the ANU in 2003 as a member of an interdisciplinary
project ‘Chanted Tales from Highland New Guinea’ (funded by the Australian Re-
search Council), of which Alan Rumsey was the lead Chief Investigator. Being
a member of this project provided me with some additional funds for fieldwork
and translation, and gave me the opportunity to take part in some very stimulat-
ing workshops and collaborations. Thanks to Alan and also to Don Niles (Partner                                         iii

Investigator on the project) for all their hard work in this regard.
    The anthropologist Nicole Haley has been working with Duna people since
1994, and was a postdoctoral fellow on the Chanted Tales project. She was in-
strumental in making this language study happen, and I have benefited greatly from
her experience and hard work. Nicole organised the establishment of the ANU re-
search base at Rewapi, introduced me to the people who were pivotal to my study
of Duna, and facilitated Kenny Kendoli and Richard Alo’s trips from PNG to Can-
berra. I was able to use some recordings that Nicole made in 2003 as part of my
data set, and am grateful for this important contribution to my work.
    The ethnomusicologist Kirsty Gillespie also joined the Chanted Tales project
in 2003, and was awarded her doctorate this year for her research into creativity
and change in Duna song. She has been an inspiring colleague and a warm and
supportive friend. Kirsty made a number of excellent recordings of spoken Duna
texts in 2005 (listed in Appendix 1) and made these available for my use. These
have greatly added to the richness and quality of data I had available for analysis,
and include some of my favourite stories. There are also several language structures
and subtleties that I would have missed entirely were it not for Kirsty’s study of song
texts while we were in the field. It was great to work together and I look forward to
doing so again.
    I am grateful to my fellow students in the linguistics department at RSPAS, in
particular Carol Priestley and Antoinette Schapper, for their reading recommenda-
tions, problem-solving suggestions, thought-provoking discussions, and comrade-
ship. I only hope I can be half as enlivening and encouraging in Antoinette’s final
thesis months as she has been in mine. Extra thanks also to Bevan Barrett for always
answering my sudden random questions with poise and acuity, and to Susan Love
and Doug Marmion for their technical help.
    Many other scholars contributed to my research through their advice, discussion,
and encouragement at various times during my candidature. I am indebted to Alex-
andra Aikhenvald, Avery Andrews, Chris Ballard, Tom Ernst, Glenda Giles, Rachel
Hendery, Darja Hoenigman, Pascale Jacq, Gabriel Lomas, Elizabeth Minchin, Nick
Modjeska, Don Niles, Stephen Pattemore, Hans Reithofer, Bambi Schieffelin and
Dan Seeland. Discussing issues of evidentiality with Robyn Loughnane was es-
pecially stimulating and helpful for me, and I thank her for her insights and sug-
gestions. The attendees at the Monday morning Research Roundtable meetings at
ANU helped to get me through some dark thesis days.
    I am indebted to Kevin Murphy, Esther Fasnacht, and Esther’s late husband
Pierre, for their kindness and openheartedness in looking after me while I was in
Mt. Hagen, sending treats to the field, and taking care of my family members who
were able to visit. Kevin’s generosity in sharing his home made it possible for me
to stay and work in Hagen for an extended period when access to Lake Kopiago
was difficult, and I don’t know what I would have done without him. Pierre gave so
much in his life, and I am lucky to have known him and his family. Thanks also to
the other pilots, ground crew and office staff of the Missionary Aviation Fellowship,
and the staff at the Mt Hagen Missionary Home. These dedicated and hard-working
people solved a lot of problems for me, not to mention keeping me cheerful. Like
so many other PNG researchers, I also thank Jim Robins of the National Research
Institute in Port Moresby.

     My interest in New Guinea languages was sparked and developed by two caring,
energetic, and inspiring teachers, Bill Foley and Mark Donohue. I am profoundly
grateful to Bill and Mark for fostering the will and providing the opportunity for my
first trip to Papua New Guinea in 2000, which I undertook with Mark and another
great companion, Melissa Crowther. It was also around this time that I met Miriam
Corris, who has been a leading light for me throughout the writing of this thesis.
Warm thanks to Mim for her understanding and encouragement, and also for the
generosity and patience of her and her partner Phil Hayman in helping me with
formatting.
     My dear friends Anna Lockwood and Jessica Kemp were resident in Hewa and
Bogaia communities, neighbouring Duna country, on my first field trip in 2003-4.
Heartfelt thanks to both of them for all their stalwart and loving support, not to
mention providing me with a home at various times. Other people whom I wish to
thank for especially helping to make Canberra home and for urging me on with this
thesis are Matilda Thomas, Steph Garling, Yuri Cath, Ben Jeffares, Brett Calcott,
James Berrell, Maggie and Sweep, and my indomitable grandmother Ma’adi Miller.
     My family have been extremely supportive throughout my doctoral research,
as ever. My parents Craig and Georgina and sister Mehera undoubtedly planted
the seeds that gave me the confidence and curiosity to begin language study in
an unfamiliar country. Thanks also to their respective partners Jude Prichard, John
Diamond and Tim Edmond, and to my brother Matthew Hall and sister-in-law Anita
Bulan. Having my mum and John visit in the field was a wonderful experience, and I
am so glad they could come. Finally, there is my husband Chris Haskett, a powerful
sustaining force in my life since we met in 2004. Thank you, darling, for sticking

Other glossing conventionsIn example sentences I use a hyphen (-) to represent ligature between two morphemes where
(at least one) of the morphemes does not occur as a freestanding form. I use the equals sign
(=) to represent ligature for: bound morphemes that attach to the final predicate, but do not
occur in a primary inflectional capacity (§8.1.1.1), that is, epistemic particles (§10.4) and
the sentence-final markers =nia ASSERT and =pe ‘Q’ (§11.1); and dependent third person
pronouns (§6.6.3). I do not use ‘-’ versus ‘=’ to represent an overall distinction between
affixes and a clitics. A large number of the bound forms that I describe in this thesis are
arguably clitics on the basis of their distributional flexibility. However, a more developed
understanding of Duna phonology is necessary to explore the validity and applicability of
a clear clitic/affix distinction, and I use ‘=’ for morphemes which are anomalous in other
ways.
     Where a single Duna morpheme requires glossing with more than one English word,
these are separated by a full stop. In certain cases where a given morpheme encodes more
than one category or meaning I use a forward slash (/) to separate these two meanings.
     Words in example sentences that are clearly related to Tok Pisin and/or English words
are annotated ‘lw’ (for ‘loan word’) in the gloss. Some of the examples in this thesis in-
clude Duna words that belong to a “special esoteric vocabulary” (Haley 2002:132) called
kẽyaka. Kẽyaka terms are used extensively in song, but are not typically used in everyday
conversation or spoken narratives. Kẽyaka terms are indicated in example sentence glosses
with ‘k.’ preceding the approximate import of the word.
     In Chapters 9 to 11 approximations of perception events that are entailed by evidential
markers (§9.2) are shown in curly brackets in the English translation.
Chapter 1Introduction
1.1     The Duna community
1.1.1    Duna lands and people
Introduction    The Duna language is spoken by approximately 25,000 people liv-
ing in the north-west corner of Southern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea
(Figure 1.1).1 The word ‘Duna’ refers to both a language and a people. This term
(derived from a Huli designation, see §1.1.2) was adopted by the Australian admin-
istration and is now conventionally accepted as standard reference in English and
Tok Pisin; see Haley (2002:14). The indigenous self-designating term is Yuna. The
language is classified as a member of the Duna-Bogaya subgroup of the Trans New
Guinea family (Wurm 1975; Ross 2005a).2
    Duna lands extend from the headwaters of the Pori and Tumbudu Rivers in
the south-east, through the river valleys to the Strickland River in the north-west
(Figure 1.2), and lie within the Koroba-Lake Kopiago district of the province. The
information that I provide in this section predominantly applies to the north-western
Duna region (§1.2.1), particularly the Lake Kopiago area. This is where several
researchers who have contributed significantly to the available literature on Duna
were based, and is also where I conducted my own fieldwork (§1.3.1).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"
"11.2.1.2     Relevance to Duna
As mentioned previously, standard implications concerning subject identity that are
generated by predicate markers in Duna typically follow a conjunct/disjunct pat-
tern.14 In particular, these implications show an alternation in declaratives and inter-
rogatives as to whether the speaker or addressee is targeted as the most or least likely
candidate for the subject slot, and are sensitive to whether or not a subject is voli-
tional. Evidential markers (§9.2) and the prophetic inflection (§8.2.3.3) align with
the disjunct category. The intentive (§8.2.2.3) and promissive inflections (§8.2.3.5)
align with the conjunct category. Other declarative inflections are (as far as the
current data indicate) basically neutral forms.15
    The conjunct/disjunct distribution of forms is not strongly grammaticised as
subject agreement in Duna: it is not true to say that the morphemes under dis-
cussion encode informant (and non-informant) as person categories, and index the
coidentity of instantiations of these categories and clausal arguments. Rather, this
distinctive distribution is largely a consequence of the individual semantics of the
morphemes, the way an informant is typically linked to the perceiver entailed by
certain morphemes, and logical and/or conventionalised expectations of how people
experience events. This is discussed as relevant throughout the following sections.
  14
      As regards the evidential markers (§11.2.2), certain morphemes tend not to be used with predic-
ates that have informant P arguments. For example, it would sound strange under normal circum-
stances for someone to describe something that had been done to them using the notional evidential
category. We can generally regard deployment of Duna results and notional evidential markers with
predicates that have an informant as one of the core arguments as unexpected, and potentially unac-
ceptable on logical grounds. Nevertheless, P argument identity does not impose any such restrictions
on the use of the visual or sensory evidential markers in the way that subject identity does, and can-
not be regarded as a clear predictive factor in predicate morphology except in a negative sense for
a small number of morphemes, and in a correlative sense as a function of subject identity implica-
tions. With respect to alternation between the intentive and prophetic inflections (§11.2.3), and the
applicability of certain deontic modality inflections (§11.2.4) the identity of the P argument has no
direct bearing on what forms are used.
   15
      However, the fact that verbs with informant subjects draw their inflections from a smaller pool of
morphemes, coupled with the semantic contrasts expressed in the inflectional system, also means that
there is a markedly increased likelihood for certain morphemes to occur in clauses with informant
subjects. This is a tendency rather than a clearly predictive relationship, but is nevertheless notable.

11.2.2     Evidential markers
In this section I outline the distribution of evidential markers in declarative and
interrogative sentences, with respect to the variable of subject identity. I focus on
the personal rather than impersonal evidentials, for reasons that are explained in
§11.2.2.1.
    Evidential markers (§9.2) reference different kinds of information sources as
primary meanings. They are generally incompatible with speaker subjects in de-
claratives as it is unexpected (and in some cases incomprehensible) for someone
to describe their own actions through explicit reference to external evidence. Our
knowledge of our own activities is more substantially derived from performing them
rather than seeing or hearing about them. Evidential markers typically suggest that
an event is experienced by the informant (that is, speaker in declaratives, addressee
in interrogatives) as an observer rather than a willing participant, and this is illus-
trated in §11.2.2.2 and §11.2.2.3. Sections 11.2.2.4 -§11.2.2.6 describe some other
extended uses and implications of evidential markers.","[454, 455]"

    Verbs in Duna VACs are drawn from the consonantal and wa-class verb sets.15
The verb adjunct adds semantic content and may contribute to the argument struc-
ture of the clause, for example, forming a bivalent predicate with a monovalent
‘host’ verb (see for example §7.4.3.1). Typically the verb adjunct immediately pre-
cedes the host verb and the construction can be negated as a unit with the negative
circumfix na- -ya (§7.4.2.2). Most verb adjuncts occur with only one host verb, but
some may occur with several different verbs, contributing recognisably constant
semantics in each case (§7.4.2.3).",[265]

I have recorded four forms that are typically used in combination with the verb ke-

these forms, shown in Table 7.13, as involuntary perception expressions.",[291]
"
Multiple instantiations of the predicate  Duna has two formally distinct but appar-
ently functionally equivalent morphological operations that indicate multiple in-
stantiations of the activity denoted by the predicate.5 These Duna operations re-
late to Lichtenberk’s (2000b) discussion of morphology that marks reciprocal but
not reflexive situations, broadly encoding ‘plurality of relations’. Functions of such
markers identified by Lichtenberk that have particular relevance to the Duna data are
the encoding of reciprocal, distributed, and repetitive situations. The Duna marking
may be used where a single subject does one activity several times or for a sustained
   4
      This morpheme is homophonous with the ‘exhaustive’ modifier -ku- described earlier in this
section. I treat them as separate morphemes, distinguishable from context, as there is no indication
that they are semantically related.
    5
      This functional equivalence was brought to my attention by Giles (MSa).

    For regular verbs, the verb root is (partially or completely) reduplicated. Con-
sonantal and wa-class verbs may undergo reduplication or use a special ‘MULTI’
form composed of the consonant base and the sequence uri. These alternatives do
not appear to encode any difference in meaning. Examples are shown in (466)-

Causative    A morpheme with the regular form -wae (homophonous with the final
hortative TAM marker, §8.2.4.3) is added prior to the application of verbal inflection
to indicate that the predicate activity is either allowed or caused to happen. It thus
adds an additional actor participant to the clause. Examples are shown in (474)-

"9.3.3     Past time events
9.3.3.1    Recent past, shared standpoint
The bound form -ra (SHRD) occurs as a verbal inflection on predications that repres-
ent very recent activities, and indicates that the speaker assesses the proposition as
representing collective knowledge that is shared by both speaker and hearer.48 The
  47
      This kind of firsthand/non-firsthand semantic split is not uncommon in evidential systems of the
world (see Aikhenvald 2004; Johansen and Utas 2000), and there is some indication that it is the
way the (relatively) nearby Angal system operates in the denotation of present time events (Madden

      As for the individual standpoint marker -pa (§9.3.2.1), -ra occurs very rarely as a final inflection
in monologic narrative text, and my analysis of this form is provisional. Looking on the bright side,
the low frequency of the ‘standpoint’ markers -pa and -ra in narrative data is itself interesting, as
it contrasts markedly with the distribution of most other verbal inflections. TAM inflections and
evidential markers are readily deployed in narrative to index features of the narrative-internal world,
350                                Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
predicated activity is typically something that the speaker and hearer did and/or
witnessed in each other’s company, and/or something they have conversed about,
each having contributed to the other’s understanding of the event. This morpheme
is similar to the ‘referential’ marker in Pole (Engan Family), as described by Rule
(1977).
     The shared standpoint marker -ra is added to the o-base of consonantal verbs
(including the semi-irregular verb ra- ‘sit’), the i-base of wa-class verbs, and the
i-base or a-base of partial wa-class verbs. Giles (MSa) describes -ra as the ‘perfect’
or ‘general perfect’ past tense.
     Some examples of -ra are shown in (834) - (837). These illustrate that -ra
is commonly used in describing events that have just happened in the immediate
sphere of the speech situation. The predicated activity is something that the speaker
assumes has already been introduced into the ‘knowledge store’ (Vallduvı́ 1992) of
the speaker and hearer, either through the fact of it happening, or through reference
to it in conversation, or both. KK suggested that the sentence shown in (835) would
be suitable as a response if Person A had just thrown something over to Person B
and then asked them if they had caught it. In (836) ra occurs following the negative
circumfix na- -ya (§8.3).(834)    ayu ho-ra.

         ‘That man is deaf and didn’t hear.’ (Giles MSa:L27)    Example (837) is from a conversation in which the speaker and I were taking
turns looking through binoculars. The speaker was using the binoculars and I asked
her something about what she could see. She was surprised at my question, as I had
just had a turn a few moments previously; her response is something of a rebuke.(837)    ko ke-ra.

         ‘You just looked!’ (LC)
either through the adoption of a main character’s viewpoint, or within reported speech (that may
or may not be overtly marked as such). This difference in distribution suggests that as inflectional
forms the standpoint markers are very closely tied to the actual speech situation and the identities of
speaker and hearer, and that this reference is not readily transferable to the narrated world.
9.3. Information status markers                                                              351
    The current data suggest that -ra is not generally used on final clauses in refer-
ence to events that happened anything more than a couple of days before the time of
utterance. Example (838) shows a sentence for which marking with -ra was judged
unacceptable, referring to an event of more than a year ago.49(838)    * alala no ho-nga          ko-ra-ngi,             Hirandareke mali

         dance-DEP be/stand-SHRD
         When I was first here, [they] danced a mali at Hirandareke. (CED/VIII:95)     The question and answer pairs (839) and (840) illustrate that -ra is only suitable
if the predicated activity is to some extent already established as something that the
speaker and hearer know about. An answer to a fairly open question such as that
shown at (ko aki pope?) ‘what did you do?’ is likely to introduce an event that
the questioner does not know about, in which case it cannot be marked with -ra.
PK stated that a sentence such as (839b) would be unacceptable to answer (839a).
Example (839c), in which the verb is inflected as perfective, would be the suitable
response. However, PK suggested that (840b) would be a good response in the event
that Person A had previously asked Person B to plant some corn seeds, and seeing
them later in the day finds out from them whether they have in fact done so (see
§9.3.3.2 concerning the form -rape in this example).(839)     a. A: ko sirakura aki po=pe.

              ‘Yes, I planted your corn seeds.’ (ED/VIII:134)
  49
     This example also shows -ra SHRD occurring as part of an adverbial clause marked by -ngi
‘TIME’ (§6.4.4.2). This morpheme attaches to nominal or demonstrative roots, and in this construc-
tion -ra is employed with demonstrative function. Note also that in this function the form is not
restricted to marking recent events.
352                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
    As we have seen in §6.2, -ra SHRD can also function as a demonstrative in
nominal and place phrases, in which case it is followed by an NP or PlP marker, and
used in denoting items that are known to the speaker and addressee(s) because they
have already been referred to in the discourse and/or experienced by both parties in
the real world.
    Example (841) shows a use of -ra that is unusual in the textual data. Having
just voiced the words used by a character in a story in a directly reported speech
construction, the storyteller marks the complement-taking verb ruwa- ‘say’ with the
shared standpoint marker. In this case, the storyteller appears to treat the utterance
of the story character as something that is not only part of a world that is shared by
the story-internal interlocutors, but also that which is known to the audience through
his enactment of it. This somewhat resembles the discourse demonstrative use of
epistemic demonstrative forms.(841)     ima-na-ka          ri-ya,    yawi ndu-ka khã-ya ka-yanua,                    anoa-na

The uncertainty marker -rape (UNC) signifies that the factual status of a proposition
is not known by the speaker, and that he or she does not identify anyone else in
particular as having knowledge concerning it.50
    The marker -rape typically occurs as an ancillary form, following an inflected
verb (Chapter 10). However, there are a few instances in the data where it appears
to have primary inflectional function and occurs on an otherwise uninflected verb
root, so I define it as an information status marker rather than an epistemic particle
(§10.4). When the uncertainty marker -rape occurs as a primary inflection, it marks
a speculation concerning a past event, indicating that the speaker thinks the pre-
dicated activity may have occurred prior to the time of speaking. The uncertainty
marker occurs on the o-base form of consonantal verbs and the i-base form of wa-
class verbs. Examples are shown in (842) - (844).","[378, 379, 380, 381]"
"11.1     Overview of sentence types
11.1.1   Introduction
Sadock and Zwicky (1985:155) define the term ‘sentence type’ as referring to “a
coincidence of grammatical structure and conventional conversational use”. Defin-
itions of sentence types are based on a correlation between typical functions (for
example asking a question or making an assertion) and the contrasting structures
of utterances that achieve (or are intended to achieve) these functions. König and
Siemund (2007:277) remind us that the illocutionary force (function) of a partic-
ular utterance is something that is negotiated between speech act participants in a                                        409
410                                    Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
particular context, and cannot be precisely determined through reference to formal
properties only. However, structures that index sentence type do provide one kind of
signal of what the speaker wants the addressee to ‘do’ with the proposition encoded
in the utterance (cf. Weber 1986), for example, understand it as information that the
speaker has and is communicating to them (a statement), assess the proposition in
terms of his or her own knowledge and respond accordingly (a question), or bring
the denoted situation about (a directive).
    I define Duna sentences as being one of six types: declarative (§11.1.2), inter-
rogative, speculative, imperative, optative, or assumptive. Interrogatives are grouped
with speculatives (§11.1.3) and imperatives are grouped with optatives (§11.1.4), as
these sentence types have some formal and functional similarities and it is useful to
be able to discuss them together. The positive identification of assumptive sentences
as a unitary discrete type is somewhat problematic, and this is discussed in §11.1.5.
   Four diagnostics that are used in defining the six sentence types are:      i whether the sentence includes an interrogative word (§3.9) and/or the question marker
        =pe (§11.1.3.2). This is a feature of interrogative and speculative sentences.   ii whether the final marker on the predicate can be followed by either -na ‘SPEC’ or
        =nia ‘ASSERT’ (§11.1.2.1). This is a feature that is typically associated with declar-
        atives.   iii whether there is an assumption that the sentence has an addressee subject. This is a
        feature of optative and imperative sentences.   iv whether the sentence can be (notionally) reframed as a sensible ‘twin’ counterpart
        that has a different value with respect to being interrogative. For example, a declar-
        ative sentence can usually have the marker =pe attached to it, resulting in a corres-
        ponding interrogative sentence. This feature is characteristic of declarative, optative,
        and interrogative sentences.","[438, 439]"

Chapter 4Basic clause structure
4.1     Clause types
I define four basic clause types in Duna with reference to the word class and valency
of the predicate. Section 4.1.1 describes non-verbal clauses, that is, those that are
headed by a non-verb (for example, a nominal or adjective) and are not marked
with inflectional TAM or polarity morphology (Chapter 8). Non-verbal clauses
typically describe timeless relationships of equation and attribution rather than tem-
porally specified events or states. Sections 4.1.2 - 4.1.4 describe verbal clauses,
which are headed by an inflected verb. Verbal clauses can be monovalent (§4.1.2),
bivalent (§4.1.3), or trivalent (§4.1.4). Some adjectival roots can also head mono-
valent verbal clauses (§4.1.2.4).","[124, 125]"

           PSN   query-SPEC go.PFV=Q
         ‘Where has Kipu gone?’ (ED/VIII:134)(1024) ko-ya=pe.
           2Sg-BEN=Q
         ‘Is [that] yours?’ (LC/III:60)   The assertion marker =nia (§11.1.2.1) and question marker do not co-occur, as
shown by (1025).(1025) * ko na-nda=nia=pe
             2SG eat-INT=ASSERT=Q
         * Will you eat? (CD/XIV:21)    The question marker may also occur as a phonologically free form, see (1036),
and can constitute an entire utterance. In the latter case, the interrogative marker
refers back to what has just been said, typically expressing the speaker’s interest in
and/or wonder at what the addressee is telling them.5
    König and Siemund (2007:294-5) comment that, where interrogative sentences
are derived from the application of an interrogative particle or clitic to a declarative
sentence, this marker is typically positioned sentence finally (especially in verb-final

    I observed this ‘feedback interrogative’ in conversation, but unfortunately have not found any
occurrence of it in the transcribed data so am unable to provide a suitable example.

languages). This is basically the case in Duna, albeit somewhat complicated by the
alternative interrogative pattern, in which the interrogative marker links alternate
propositions and is not necessarily reiterated sentence-finally.","[444, 445]"
"7.5.2   Adjunct noun constructions
In an adjunct noun construction the predicate consists of a noun (N) and an con-
sonantal or wa-class verb. The noun cannot be analysed as denoting a participant
that is subcategorised for by the verb (it is not an argument), is non-referential, and
is typically not modified either lexically (for example, by a postposed adjective)
or morphologically (for example, by an NP marker). The noun is placed after all
other referring expressions that occur in the clause and usually immediately pre-
cedes the verb. The noun contributes to the semantics of the predicate in a way that
is semi-transparent, but is not predictable or productive.
    The general template for a typical adjunct noun construction is shown in Figure
7.4. This template resembles the structure of a verb adjunct construction in that a
non-verb element immediately precedes the verb, contributing to the meaning of the
predicate. However, unlike a verb adjunct construction, the argument structure of
the predication is entirely predictable from the verb, and the noun and verb cannot
be treated as comprising a unitary stem for the purposes of negation.

                      Figure 7.4 Typical ‘adjunct noun’ construction     An example of an adjunct noun construction is shown in (547a). The predicate
consists of the bivalent verb suwa- ‘hold’ in combination with the common noun re
‘eye’ and means ‘watch closely, guard’. The clause includes both a subject NP (no,
‘I’) and object NP (anda ‘house’), and as the verb is bivalent there is no subcatgor-
ised participant slot left that re could be occupying as an argument. In all elicited
and textual examples of this construction, the noun re ‘eye’ immediately precedes
the verb. However, in constructed sentences placing the day-term hata between the
adjunct noun and the verb as in (547b) was judged acceptable, showing that the
noun is not formally bound to the verb root. Another example that includes the
expression re suwa- is shown in (548).

noun with suwa- ‘hold’. This expression means ‘count time periods’, and relates
to the traditional practice of marking time periods by tying knots in a cord (KK
pers. comm.). Example (550) shows sia ‘foot/leg’ occurring as an adjunct noun in
construction with the verb ka- ‘be/stand’ in an expression that means ‘step, place
one’s foot’.(549)    mali            paneki suwa=pe ke-nda khana pongo suwa-no.

a monovalent predicate that means ‘marry (with a man)’.21 Example (553) shows
that the adjunct noun cannot precede the subject NP no ‘I’. Example (554) shows
that when it occurs in construction with nga- the noun anoa ‘man’ is not a suit-
able candidate to head a full NP; further information concerning the nature of the
marrying partner is expressed through the addition of a pair-marked NP (§5.4.1).22(552)    no phukao-ya no anoa nga-ya...

     The bivalent verb rou- is used to describe a man marrying a woman.

     When using a referential NP that denotes a particular husband (‘X’), it is more usual to use an

        ‘One day you will marry with a good man.’ (CED/XIV:135)    Unlike serialised verbs and predicates that include verb adjuncts, adjunct noun
constructions such as those shown in (547a) to (552) are not usually negated as a
unit, as shown by the unacceptability of (555a). Negation can be expressed through
applying the negative circumfix to the verb only, as shown in (555b). Example
(555b) shows that in an alternative interrogative (§11.1.3.4) the nominal may be
omitted at the second iteration of the predicate.(555)   a. * Juli anoa ngo=pe na-anoa nga-ya

                   Figure 7.5 Template of an ‘object-verb predication’
    Object-verb predications are predications that involve an NP and a verb. They
do not really represent a single formally distinct construction type, as the major
defining criterion is semantic and gradient rather than structural and categorically
discrete. Clauses that include object-verb predications show some characteristics
of ordinary bivalent clauses with subject and object NPs. They also share similar-
ities with adjunct noun constructions in that word order is typically restricted, and
the meaning of the predication is substantially derived from a nominal constituent.
Object-verb predications are similar to ‘restricted collocations’ (Cowie 1998), com-
binations of words where the meaning of one element is “governed by its association
with another word or phrase” (Pawley 2007:7), for example, the expression ‘meet
demands’ in English. They are also idiomatic under Nunberg et al.’s (1994) defini-
tion in that the meaning cannot be predicted from the sum of its parts, and a literal

        ‘cord, fibre ’            ‘eat’
interpretation of the phrase is cases possible, albeit rather odd. Some examples of
object-verb predications are shown in Table 7.10.
    It can be seen in Table 7.10 that some object-verb predications are part of a
family of expressions which follow a generalised semantic structure, rather than
being one-off expressions. For example, the existential verb (e)ra- ‘be/put’ occurs
in construction with nouns that denote bodily substances in clauses that describe
extrusion or excretion. The more members there are of the family, the more tenable
it becomes to say that what we are dealing with here is (constructional) polysemy
of the verb (see also §7.5.4.2).
   Examples (556) - (560) illustrate some of the expressions shown in Table 7.10.
The apparent ‘object’ noun is unmodified and immediately precedes the verb.(556)   khia ra-nda          ma   ru.

        ‘I will hang myself.’ (lit. eat rope) (ED)    As with adjunct nominal constructions, placing the ‘object’ noun before the sub-
ject argument usually doesn’t work; see (561) and (562). This kind of inflexibility
argues against treating the expression as a typical bivalent clause (as subject and
object NPs can normally appear in either SO or OS order, the latter being pragmat-
ically marked).(561)   * heka imane su
          bird girl      hold.PFV
        * A woman transformed into a bird (CD/XIV:76)

          cord 1SG eat-INT
        * I will hang myself (CD/XIV:156)
        (Could mean: ‘I will eat cord’)    However, for at least some expressions, the nominal appears to be the head of a
full NP that references a P argument. In (563) the noun is modified by an adjective.
In (564) the noun is marked as specific (that is, is clearly referential) and does not
occur in the same clause as its host verb but in the preceding clause, that is, the
item is referenced through zero anaphora. In (564), there is no reason to analyse
mbalutana ‘the plane’ as anything other than an object NP, beyond the fact that it
collocates with a particular specialised meaning of the verb suwa- ‘hold’. This is
not in itself sufficient grounds to propose a distinct structural relationship.(563)   ho-na         nane kete si-tia        ri-na.

        (T/JP:KG05V7.11)    Individual object-verb predications show some differences concerning whether
or not the nominal element and the verb in the construction must be immediately
contiguous. For example, for the phrase khiau suwa- ‘use fire-making kit’, it is
possible for the time/manner word ala to occur in between the constituents (565),
and a locative NP can occur between hapa ‘egg’ and era- ‘put’ in the expression
‘lay eggs’ (566). See also the phrase mali suwa- ‘hold a mali dance’ in (549), in
which an (interrogative) temporal occurs in between the noun and the verb.(565)   no hawa na-nda            khiau ala suwa-nda...

        ‘Now the kango bird lays its eggs in trees [they] say.’ (T/HS:080305ib)     However, RA and KK judged that the phrase heka suwa- ‘transform into a bird’
does not allow a temporal to be interposed, as shown in (567) and (568). The expres-
sion is fixed, and the special meaning it has cannot be maintained if arrangement of
its elements is disrupted.(567)   imane ndu (ala) heka (*ala) su.

        ‘A young woman (yesterday) turned into (*yesterday) a bird.’ (CD/XIV:76)    Like adjunct noun constructions, object-verb predications do not undergo unit-
ary negation. If the negative circumfix is used it will be applied to the verb only. An
example is shown in (569). However, the lexical negator neya (§8.3.3) is preferred
for object-verb predications.(569)   imane-na heka su=pe, na-si-ya.

7.5.4     Inceptive/factitive uses of ka- ‘be/stand’
7.5.4.1    Adjunct noun type
The verb ka- ‘be/stand’ can occurs in construction with a noun that cannot be iden-
tified as denoting an argument, is unmodified, and immediately precedes the verb,
that is, resembles an adjunct noun. However, the derived predication may be either
ambivalent or bivalent. This goes against the usual pattern of adjunct noun con-
structions, in that the argument structure of the complex predication is different
from that of the verb when it occurs alone as a simple predicate. A general template
for constructions that use employ ka- in this way is shown in Figure 7.6.

means ‘begin’. This can head a monovalent clause, as in (570), or a bivalent clause
as in (571).(570)     hata       ka-ta         arene      se     kutia.

occur like adjunct nouns with ka- ‘be/stand’ to describe saturation or staining, as
shown in (572) and (573). Example (573) shows that adverbial modifiers such as
peli ‘well, thoroughly’ can either precede the nominal or be interposed between the
nominal and the verb (but not both at the same time).(572)     no slipas iwa-ta         nga-yaroko, khiapo ndola-ya, haka khiapo

Other complex predicates with ka- ‘be/stand’ are more like object-verb predications.
In combination with certain nouns, ka- appears to have the bivalent sense ‘make’,
as shown in (576) - (578). The nominal occurs in an NP that refers to the ‘made’
item. A general template for a clause in which ka- has this ‘make’ sense is shown
in Figure 7.7.23

    This construction relates to possessive expansion of existential clauses (§7.5.5.1), in that a
monovalent existential verb is used as a quasi-bivalent predicate to describe a relationship between
two items.

Some adjectives can be marked with verbal inflections and head verbal clauses.
Verbal clauses headed by an adjective are monovalent and generally atelic, describ-
ing a constant state rather than a changing process. Alternatively, adjectival roots
may occur as part of a complex predicate preceding the verb ka- ‘be/stand’. The
general pattern of this construction is represented in Figure 7.8. As can be seen
from a comparison of this structure with that shown in Figure 7.3, the adjectival
root is somewhat equivalent to a verb adjunct in a verb adjunct construction.

    Complex predicates composed of an adjective + ka- show similar properties to
verb adjunct constructions in that ka- supplies an inceptive/factitive frame but little
semantic content. They are also similar in that they may be negated by the negative
circumfix as a single unit, as shown in (585a). In this case both RA and KK felt that
negating the verb only as in (585b) was equally acceptable.(585)     a. ka ipa roro ko=pe,                  na-roro ka-ya.

7.5.5.1    Expressing possession
In many non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea existential clauses can be ‘ex-
panded’ to express possession (Rumsey 2002). In this section I provide examples of
the three major Duna existential verbs ka- ‘be/stand’, ra- ‘be/sit’ and era- ‘be/put’
as they occur in this kind of possessive clause.
    The relationship between an existential clause (examples (586) - (588)) and an
expanded existential possessive clause (examples (589) - (593)) is summarised in
Figure 7.9. The grammatical status of the NPs in expanded existential clauses is
discussed further at the close of this section.

    In monovalent use, existential verbs describe the existence or location of someone
or something as shown in (586) - (588). The nature of the S argument (for example,
as a large upright vs small squat animal) determines which existential verb is selec-
ted (§3.3.2).(586)     ita teng    raki       khou-ra       kei.

possessive relationship. Examples are shown in (589) - (593).(589)   no ita phukao ndu kei.

subject argument properties. It may be formally marked as a contrasted subject, as
in (594) and (595), and its identity can restrict the application of evidential markers

    Example (596) shows the evidentially-marked verb karua heading a monovalent
existential clause, and example (597) shows the same verb form in an expanded
possessive clause with a third person possessor. This verb form is not acceptable
with a speaker subject in a declarative sentence (598), nor is it appropriate to a
speaker possessor (599).(596)     guapa rowa ndu ka-rua.

            1SG pig two be/stand-STAT.VIS . P
          ? I have two pigs {I saw} (ED/XV:19)    The oddness of the use of the visual evidential in (599) could also be because
this morpheme has a distancing effect (§11.2.2.6). It sounds strange to describe
one’s own possessive relationship with something using a morpheme that implies
one has nothing to do with the predicated state. Nevertheless, there remains some
justification for regarding the possessor as a subject in this situation. The structure
of an expanded existential clause under this reading is represented as in Figure 7.10.
The possessor is a subject, and the possessed item—which continues to control the
existential verb that is selected—is like an object NP in an object-verb predication.

7.5.5.2    Existential verb as copula
As described in §4.1.1.1, nominal phrases can occur as non-verbal predicates in
clauses that express relationships of equation and attribution. These are generally
understood to describe relationships that are currently observable. Alternatively, the
time-frame of a relationship of proper inclusion can be made explicit through the
addition of an existential verb. This verb serves as a copula, forming a complex

This section describes a range of constructions that are grouped together on the
semantic basis that they describe involuntary experience (cf. Pawley et al. 2000).
As the subject argument in clauses headed by involuntary experience predications
in non-volitional, some morphological operations (for example, CS-marking of the
subject argument, see §6.6.1) and typical structural restrictions (for example, the
dispreference for evidential marking in a clause with an informant subject, see
§11.2.2) are not maintained as typical correlates of subject identity.
    The different kinds of complex predicates that describe involuntary experience
can generally be identified as structurally analogous (to at least some extent) with
one of the constructions described in §7.4 or §7.5. Sections §7.6.1.1 and §7.6.1.2
describe two kinds of predications that are composed of a noun in combination with
a verb, and show some similarities to the adjunct noun and object-verb predications
described in §7.5.2 and §7.5.3, respectively. In §7.6.2.1 I look at four ‘involuntary
experience expressions’ which are perhaps derived from verb adjunct predications,
but show features suggestive of lexicalisation as nominal/verbal roots in at least two
cases. Section 7.6.2.2 examines clauses that include ‘emotion words’, which can
function as either verbal roots, or as nominal roots in construction with a verb.","[274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287]"
"3.5     Adjectives
I refer to a group of Duna words that have formal features of both nominal and
verbal roots and generally describe properties of things as adjectives. Like nom-
inals and unlike verbs, adjectives can occur as clausal predicates in bare root form
(§4.1.1.2). They may also occur as modifiers in nominal phrases (§5.2.2). Adjectival
roots can be inflected with some morphology that is not available to nominal roots,
for example the habitual inflection -na (see, for example, (50)). Certain adjectives
can occur in a complex predicate construction with the verb ka- ‘be/stand’, describ-
ing the inception or achievement of a change of state (§7.5.4.3).15
    Some examples of Duna adjectives are shown in Table 3.7. I have grouped to-
gether adjectives that have some semantic features in common (for example, dealing
with dimension), but I do not propose that each group represents a distinct category.
The forms in Table 3.7 represent the four ‘core semantic types’ that are typically as-
sociated with the word class adjective (dimension, age, value and colour), as well as
the ‘peripheral semantic types’ of physical property and human propensity (Dixon
2004).
    As can be seen in Table 3.7, many adjectival words finish with a sequence Vo. In
Duna as spoken in the Kopiago area, the final o is subject to deletion in some lexical
items with no clear change in meaning or function.16 It is highly likely that this
final o is a semi-fossilised reflex of the perfective verbal inflection, -o (§8.2.2.1).17
  13
      Note that I designate these forms as members of a particular word class rather than as con-
stituents that are occupying a particular structural/functional position in construction with a verb.
This Duna word class could also be termed that of ‘coverbs’, following the use of this term in the
Australianist literature.
   14
      As a general rule, if the root is not attested occurring with final verb morphology (or has been
judged unacceptable in combination with it), typically occurs in bare root form, and immediately
precedes a consonantal or wa-class verb in all known examples, I interpret it as a verb adjunct, not a
verb.
   15
      The root kete ‘small’ can additionally be used in adverbial expressions (see, for example, (425)).
However this is not a general characteristic of adjectival roots.
   16
      Results of the orthography survey carried out with Duna speakers from the Kelabo area suggest
that deletion of the o is not acceptable for speakers of the south-west Duna variety.
   17

                    epo         ‘tasty’
                    ndeo        ‘hard’ (GG)This analysis would suggest that the roots in question originally had a more clearly
inceptive or progressive meaning (e.g., ‘become big’, ‘become yellow’) and that the
perfective inflection was added to indicate complete achievement of the specified
change. This can also be argued for those adjectival roots that end in u, as the
perfective inflection has an allomorph -u.
    Some adjectival roots, such as kete ‘small’, typically occur in nominal phrases
whereas others such as rakare ‘cold’ typically occur as predicates of verbal clauses.
The latter term can be negated with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3), whereas
the former cannot. The behaviour of all adjectival roots with respect to this property
is not known. However, it is likely that further study will provide formal evidence
for the existence of different noun-like and verb-like classes within the proposed
group of adjectival roots, primarily relating to a distinction between properties that
are more time-stable, and those that are more dynamic.","[109, 110]"
"9.3.2     Present time events
9.3.2.1     Individual standpoint -pa
The bound form -pa (INDV)38 functions as a verbal inflection on predications that
represent activities that are ongoing at the time of speaking. It occurs in this capacity
on regular verbs only; the semi-finite imperfective inflection (§8.2.2.2) provides an
approximate functional equivalent for consonantal and wa-class verbs.
    The available data39 suggest that use of this form relates to the encoding of a
knowledge and/or evidence differential between speaker and hearer.40 That is, it is
used in situations where the speaker thinks that the speaker and addressee do not
necessarily both have access to the information; the stated proposition is treated as
representing the speaker’s ‘individual’ knowledge. Typically the predicated activity
cannot be seen by the addressee (and may or may not be seen by the speaker).41
       Examples (820) - (822) show -pa being used in situations where the predicate
  38
      The individual standpoint marker and imperative TAM marker (§8.2.4.1) are segmentally the
same but contrast in pitch. For example, inflecting the verb kuru- ‘dance’ as imperative results in
a word with the sharp fall contour [h.m.l]. Marking the same verb with the individual standpoint
marker results in the level-fall contour [m.m.l].
   39
      The form -pa hardly ever occurs as a verbal inflection in narrative text (see also §9.3.3.1), and
as such is very rare in the available ‘natural’ language data (§1.3.3.1). Further contrastive conversa-
tional data are required to more clearly delimit its meaning and function.
   40
      The individual standpoint marker -pa is probably related in some wise to the interrogative form
pa- (§3.9). This demonstrative-like root relates to the indication of a ‘knowledge differential’, as it
identifies something the speaker does not know, and thinks the addressee does know.
   41
      The Duna marker -pa thus shows functional similarities with the ‘unseen present’ inflectional
category described for Angal (Madden MS and Reithofer pers. comm.).

activity was not in full view of the addressee. Sentence (820) was spoken to me
in describing the activity of someone whom I couldn’t see, as my line of sight
was blocked by the verandah posts and railing. Hearing someone making noises, I
‘looked a question’ at my companion (who did have a clear view) and she ‘replied’
using (820). Example (821b) shows the reply to a question I asked of somebody I
couldn’t see at the time. Example (822) shows a statement concerning something
the speaker (presumably) couldn’t expect the addressee to be able to independently
observe.(820)   imane Juli-na-ka        ndu yoko nguri-pa.

        head pain-INDV
        ‘[My] head is hurting.’ (OH/VIII:32)    The sentences shown in (823) illustrate a contrast between inflectional use of
the specificity marker -na (§9.3.2.2) and individual standpoint marker -pa. These
sentences were spoken to me in succession while I was sitting on the verandah
(under cover), and the speaker was passing by outside. Speaking sentence (823a),
the speaker pointed to where light rainfall could be seen sparkling in sunshine.
Speaking (823b), the speaker brushed the tiny drops of water alighting on her arms.
In the first instance, the speaker was pointing something out to me that I could
observe for myself. In the second instance, the speaker adds additional information
from her own individual standpoint, as someone who feels and assesses the rain.(823)   a. ipa ralua mia-mia-na.
               water rain   drizzle-drizzle-SPEC
               ‘The rain is drizzling.’ (pointing out to me)
        b. ketele yiao        mia-mia-pa.
               little nothing drizzle-drizzle-INDV
               ‘[It is] drizzling just a little bit.’ (brushing arms) (LC/VIII:32)   In (823), the differential use of -pa and -na shows a similarity to the contrast
expressed by certain ‘engagement markers’ in Andoke (Colombia) as described by
342                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
Evans (2005), citing Landaburu (2007). Use of the individual standpoint marker
-pa is comparable to use of the Andoke engagement marker kẽ-, which “directs the
interlocutor to an experience that is hidden from them” (Landaburu 2007, Evans’
translation). The Andoke engagement marker b- contrasts with kẽ- and is com-
parable in function to the Duna marker -na, as it directs the interlocutor “to an
experience that is in principle tangible” (Landaburu 2007, Evans’ translation).
    In making statements about present events -pa is a probably the functionally
unmarked inflection for regular verbs, as it is quite a neutral way to present a pro-
position in contrast to other options (for example, specificity marking or sensory
evidential marking, §9.2.4.2; see also §9.3.2.3). The information is offered without
making an assertive claim about evidence or noteworthiness. In elicited sentences
that described hypothetical present activities (as opposed to things that were actu-
ally happening at the time), speakers I worked with would commonly choose -pa as
a verbal inflection, as in (824) and (825).42 Example (826) shows -pa following the
negative circumfix na–ya (§8.3).(824)     imanoa-ka mali            kuru-pa.

          ‘One boy isn’t coming.’ (Giles MSa:L5)9.3.2.2    Specificity marking on final verbs
In this section I introduce a Duna structure which is arguably quite distinct from
final verb inflection, but is in a relationship of functional contrast with all of the in-
flectional operations described in this and the preceding chapter, and is thus highly
pertinent to a description of verbal morphology. This comprises the use of the
specificity marker -na (§6.3.2.1) on verbs in lieu of final verbal inflection in main
clauses. As noted in §6.3.2.1, Haspelmath (1997:38) defines an expression as spe-
cific where “the speaker presupposes the existence and unique identifiability of its
referents”. In this Duna construction, the referent of the expression that is formally
marked as specific is an existing and uniquely identifiable situation (rather than, for
example, a concrete object). I first present examples that illustrate this structure,
  42
    This is particularly true of elicitation conducted early in my fieldwork, when I was focussing on
basic vocabulary collection without any accompanying ‘scenario’.
9.3. Information status markers                                                           343
and comment further on the status of -na as an ‘information status marker’ at the
close of this section.
    The specificity marker -na can be added to a verb root and derive a finite final
predicate. It occurs in this way only on regular verbs; the equivalent construction
for consonantal and wa-class verbs (adding -na to the imperfective stem) is exem-
plified in §10.2.2.4. Such sentences are used in describing a present-time activity
that is happening in the immediate perceptual sphere of the speaker and is especially
noteworthy (for example it may be surprising, or be pertinent to the resolution of
a queried issue). Typically the activity that is described is dynamic. The utter-
ance is attention-drawing and emphatically assertive. Examples that illustrate these
qualities are shown in (827) - (832), with relevant context provided following the
translation line.(827)   no nu       ita   ra-nda      ruwa-ta ware-na.

atives are shown in (1026) - (1029), in which the interrogative marker =pe occur
on an otherwise declarative sentences. In Duna yes-no interrogatives typically have
a ‘positive bias’ effect, that is, anticipate a ‘yes’ answer that confirms the proposi-
tion. This is in contrast to alternative interrogatives (§11.1.3.4) which are typically
‘unbiased’.",[445]

ritia can have the grammatical status of an epistemic particle, rather than being
part of a construction that has comparable semantics to epistemic marking, but is
structurally distinct from it. However as described in regard to (1005) this not the
case for all speakers, and more data are required to examine the viability of this
structure in natural language.
10.5.3   Some constructions with ke- ‘see’
The verb ke- ‘see’ can also be used in constructions that expand the evidence-
marking repertoire. In these cases, the perception event (the experience of informa-
tion source) that is entailed by evidential markers is in a sense overtly expressed as
a complement-taking verb.
10.5. Examples of complex information source description                           403
    As described in §9.2.2.3, evidential markers express a contrast as to whether the
perception event is current or previous with respect to the time of utterance. Ex-
amples (1010) and (1011) show that through complementation with ke- it is also
possible to make reference to future perception events. In (1010) and (1011), the
final verb of the complement clause is marked with the current results inflection,
preceding the verb ke-. This verb is inflected as intentive, positioning the perception
of evidence as desired rather than actual; the current information source specifica-
tion refers to a time that is contemporaneous with the intended seeing rather than
the time of utterance (as is signified in independent clauses).(1010) koro-na            pa-ka       po-ri    ke-nda ruwa-ta nga-ya-roko...

         (P/KY:KG05V3(2).2)    Example (1011) shows an utterance from the end of an interview, just before
the speaker asked to have the tape rewound so that he could listen to the recording.
The speaker anticipates that he will infer from evidence (that is, by listening to
the audio recording) whether or not he has said everything necessary in the text
he has just recorded. As the speaker is talking about assessing aural (rather than
visual) material, it is clear that the semantics of ke- are extended beyond literal
physiological seeing in this example, just as -rei is extended to index more than
purely visible evidence.(1011)    ayu ka na      sopa ri-na       eke ndu-ra    ri neya=pe piriri

-tia is marked as subordinate with the morpheme -ko and occurs as a complement
of ke- ‘see’. The verb ke- is inflected with the habitual aspect marker -na. This
structure in effect combines a visual specification with habitual aspect, a complex
semantic specification that is not represented in the evidential or TAM paradigms.
The examples shown in (1012) - (1014) are taken from personal narrative texts in

         (T/HS:61103iii)    The construction exemplified in (1012) - (1014) is one of a family of different
structures that can be used to express habitual events. The simplest way this is
achieved is through use of the habitual TAM marker -na HAB as the sole inflection
on a final verb (§8.2.3.2). Reference to the information source by which the habitual
event is known can be achieved through a complex final inflection using an evid-
ential marker, as exemplified in (909) - (912), or an extra evidence construction, as
exemplified in (930). Habitual situations can also be presented as a matter of opin-
ion with the application of an epistemic particle (974), or as reported information by
the conventialised use of the perfective visual form of the complement-taking verb
ruwa- ‘say’ (1004). Finally, where a complement-taking perception verb is overt
in the sentence and is marked as a habitual occurrence, this aspectual specification
takes scope over the seen situation expressed in the complement clause.","[431, 432, 433]"
"6.4.3   Multiple areas -kuru
The place phrase marker -kuru marks a phrase that refers to multiple areas, describ-
ing a group of like settings.27 Examples are shown in (366) - (368).(366)    hina khei [anda manda manda -ra-kuru]                      ke-ya-roko...

      I assume that in this example Sipiki is a separate object NP (the P argument of mbite- ‘cross
river’), not part of the place phrase.
   27
      Unlike -ka, -kuru does not occur following ndu. I assume this is because their semantic spe-
cifications are at odds, that is, ndu is semantically singular and -kuru is non-singular.

    There are no examples in my data of -kuru combining with the interrogative pa-
‘query’ to form an interrogative meaning ‘what places?’ (or similar). However,
the form pa-kuru does occur in the textual data in a specialised construction that
is used to describe mysterious or extraordinary places, typically those that are the
realm of pikono narrative (§1.3.3.1) and can never be known by people in ordinary,
everyday way. Pakuru follows a verbal clause (predication ‘X’) in a phrase that
means something like ‘places where X happens’. Two examples are shown in (369)
and (370).28 In (369), the speaker describes how a woman in a story (who has
wandered off, flouting the express orders of her brother) is charmed by a water spirit
and led down into his mysterious world of underground rivers (see Haley 2002). In
(370), the hero of a pikono story takes leave of his beautiful female companion,
going off on a journey of his own into distant regions of the pikono world.(369)    siri ndu kho hoa-ta           ho-na        salo      ka-ta           si-ya-ta         ipa

         (P/KY:KG05)6.4.4    Other ways of denoting locations
In this section I describe some further kinds of referring expressions that denote
times and places, in order to give a fuller picture of how description of spatial and
temporal locations can be included in a clause.
  28
     I find this construction difficult to analyse, and to do so would require a more comprehensive
analysis of Duna (including further examination of complex sentences) than is attempted in this
thesis. However, I believe it is suggestive of a relationship between the interrogative root pa and
the ‘individual standpoint’ marker pa that occurs as a verbal inflection (§9.3.2.1). Briefly, it makes
sense to interpret the interrogative root ‘query’ and the predicate marker ‘INDV’ as (deriving from)
a single form pa which is concerned with not knowing. This is commensurate with the occurrence
of forms such as -ra ‘SHRD’ as both an epistemic demonstrative and a predicate marker. The inter-
rogative function of pa (‘query’) relates to the epistemic demonstrative function of forms such as
-ra, and indicates that the referent of a phrase is not known (specifically, not known to the speaker
but assumed to be known to the addressee). When it marks a final predicate, pa (INDV) indicates
that the speaker knows about the predicated activity, but assumes that this is individual knowledge,
not necessarily shared by the addressee. Examples such as (369) and (370) give a window into a
situation where pa is exploited as: a form that is demonstrative-like, as it is followed by the place
phrase marker -kuru in a referring expression; and a marker that affixes to a verb root in a clause that
describes an ‘unknown’ situation.

6.4.4.1    Locational demonstratives and -nga ‘EXCV’
The bound form -nga occurs on personal pronouns (§6.6.2) and the locational demon-
strative roots ho ‘here’ and ha ‘there’. Its generalised meaning concerns emphatic
and exclusive identification of a referent.
    Locational demonstratives that are marked with -nga reference locations that
are exclusively identified as ‘exactly here’ (honga) or ‘exactly there’ (hanga). Ex-
amples are shown in (371) and (372).(371)     inu   ho-nga       waki-ya ra-o.

          ‘You have brought something to the house right here.’ (T/YS:270205)6.4.4.2    Time marker -ngi
The bound morpheme -ngi (TIME) occurs on words or phrases that describe the tem-
poral setting of the predicate. This marker can be viewed as somewhat equivalent
to a PlcP marker, used in the formation of a special kind of phrase (a ‘time phrase’)
that occurs only as an adjunct expression in the clause. However there is insufficient
data at present to be able to describe a general template for such a phrase.
    The time marker is attested occurring on common nouns, adjectives, and loca-
tional or class II epistemic demonstratives (examples shown in (374) - (377)), and
(rarely) on two-word phrases as in (378) (see also (389)). In some combinations -ngi
appears to be only minimally productive, occurring in fixed idiomatic expressions.(374)     ho-yarua-ngi       elekota ruwa-ta ndu se             neya-o.

  29
     Note that anda ‘house’ is not marked as locative so cannot be interpreted as a separate NP that
references a goal or location. Rather, it is part of phrase that finishes with honga.

probably represents a conventionalised use of the temporal marker rather than pro-
ductive application of it.
    There is one example in the data (379) of the temporal marker -ngi occurring
in combination with the interrogative pa-. Pa-ngi seems to express an indefinite
time (‘sometime’), but further data are required to test this. Example (379) is taken
from a pikono narrative; at this point in the story the hero is teasing a host of young
women who are keen to come and spend time with him. He has told them that he
can’t be with them now, but that one day in the future they will see signs that a big
party is about to happen and they should come then.(379)    ha     pa-ngi        warama pana-ta            wa-no        ri-tia-e

(380). The temporal interrogative is not productively compositional, although it
bears a clear relation to the productive interrogative root pa (as well as having a
final syllable that is suggestively similar to -ngi).(380)    ko antia paneki hutia.

    ‘Sweet potato time’ is contrasted with specific periods that are defined by the availability of wild

6.4.4.3    Territory marker -li
The bound form -li (TERR) occurs on locational and directional demonstratives,
forming a word that refers to a place. In all noted examples the place is a region that
is occupied by a distinct cultural/linguistic group, suggesting that -li is a ‘country’
or ‘territory’ designator.31 However, -li is rare in the textual data and the scope of
its application (both formally and semantically) is not known. Two examples are
shown in (381) and (382).

(382)     no ndulu ho-li            ka-ta,           ngei yoko nga-ya, Koro-nda ngo.

          ‘Once from here [i.e., Duna territory], I went without stopping, I went to
          Oksapmin.’ (T/PK:201003ii)
    Some other occurrences of -li include use of roma-li (‘above-TERR’) to refer
to the Mt Hagen area, and sopa-li (‘below-TERR’) to refer to the low-altitude Bo-
gaia/Yeru region (§1.1.2).32
    The morpheme -li is akin to the place phrase markers -ka and -kuru as it forms a
place-referent expression based on a demonstrative root. However, it is unlike these
markers in that it has only ever been observed to mark a single lexeme, never a
phrasal constituent, and does not precisely share PlcP marker distributional restric-
tions, as it does not occur on Class II epistemic demonstratives, and can occur on
locational demonstratives.
    According to a conversation I had with PK, it is perfectly sensible to add -li
‘TERR’ to the interrogative pa- ‘query’. Unfortunately I did not record the meaning
of pali, and there are no examples of this word in the textual data. I assume that it
means something like ‘which territory/country?’.
6.4.4.4    Morphologically unmarked oblique NPs
Certain kinds of NPs can occur as place-referent adjuncts in a clause without overt
marking as to their semantic role and oblique relation. These include NPs that con-
sist of: a placename only; a word formed with -(a)nda ‘enclosure, shelter, dwelling’
  31
      The Huli-English Dictionary (Rule and unknown collaborators 1971) records a Huli suffix -ali
‘tribe’ and this is perhaps a related form.
   32
      KK and RA suggested that, based upon observing latitude relationships on maps of the world,
sopa-li could also be used to refer to Australia, and eto-li to refer to the USA. I do not know if this is
common practice. The sequence li also occurs in some placenames (e.g., Ekali (Ekali/Agali, SHP),
previously Yeru territory and now occupied by Bogaia people), and this may be a related form.
200                                               Chapter 6. NP, PP, and PlcP morphology
or -yaki ‘side’ (§5.2.1.2); or a locational or directional demonstrative that is marked
with -na ‘SPEC’ and functions as a pro-form for a particular (endophorically or
exophorically identifiable) place.
    Examples (383) - (386) show NPs that consist of a placename. A nominal phrase
headed by a common noun would be overtly marked as a location or goal-like entity
in clauses predicated by existential or motion verbs; see, for example, (314) and
(319) in §6.3.4.2. However, an NP that consists of a placename typically is not.
Such words are inherently place-referent and their relationship to the predicate can
be assumed.33(383)    inu    Kalipopo ra-o.

  33
      In some cases it is alternatively possible to argue that unmarked NPs are arguments that are
semantically required by the predicate, and that this is the reason they are realised as unmarked.
Whilst it is certainly true that NPs that I analyse as unmarked obliques typically occur with motion
and existential verbs (i.e., those verbs for which it would be quite sensible to argue for subcategor-
ised location or goal-like arguments), the ‘core argument’ interpretation does not account for the
acceptability of sentences such as (385) and (386). In these examples the placenames Hakene and
Yerikuru are unmarked NPs, but there is no obvious reason why the predicates in these clauses would
‘require’ a place-like argument.
   34
      This place name appears to include the ‘place group’ marker -kuru as a fossilised form.
6.5. Role-marking postpositions                                                    201
    Example (389) shows two unmarked oblique NPs that consist of a demonstrative
marked with -na ‘SPEC’. Context makes their place-referent function clear because
the sentence is about two known individuals who live at different places and thus
are not able to meet easily; sopa-na ‘the below one’ is understood to refer to the
place Ekali (the low-altitude Bogaia settlement in the Strickland Gorge), and hona
‘the here one’ is understood to refer to Rewapi-Hirane (where the sentence is being
spoken).(389)   ko pi     sopa-na      ra-ya,      no pi   ho-na    rei-na,

to Aluni, a Duna area that is lower than Hirane (but higher and closer than Ekali,
referred to in 389). This example is the answer to a question as to where the speaker
(met on the road) is coming from. In this case other relevant context is that the
speaker has close land and family ties in Aluni and travels there often; Aluni is thus
the most salient ‘below one’ in this conversational situation.(390)   sopa-na     ko            hoa-ya.

hata ‘yesterday’ in (404)) can also be understood as unmarked ‘circumstantial’ ob-
lique NPs (§4.2.2.2). Referential temporals are nominal-like, but are almost entirely
constrained by their meaning to occur as adjunct expressions in the clause; the ma-
jor function of a word that denotes a period of time will be to describe the temporal
setting of a predicated activity.","[224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230]"

     Ancillary markers follow inflected verbs or non-verbal predicates, and provide
further information concerning someone’s (typically the speaker’s) assessment of
the proposition encoded in the clause to which it attaches, for example, as some-
thing that is certainly the case, or as something that has been learnt thought a cer-
tain kind of evidence. In certain cases with verbal predicates the ancillary marker
combines with the primary inflection to form what I term a complex finite inflec-
tion. Otherwise, ancillary markers are optional extra forms that can be removed
with no consequences as to the grammatically independent status of the clause. The
occurrence of ancillary markers on final predicates is described in Chapter 10.
     I identify four groups of bound forms that can be employed as primary inflec-
tions and/or ancillary markers on final predicates. These are: TAM markers, eviden-
tial markers, information status markers and epistemic particles. These groups are
primarily identified on a formal basis, with some input from semantic features. The
possible functions of TAM markers, evidential markers, information status markers
and epistemic particles with respect to the primary inflection vs ancillary marker
distinction are shown in Table 8.1.","[296, 297]"

11.1.3.1    Introduction
Sadock and Zwicky distinguish the interrogative sentence type generally as that
which “signal[s] the desire of the speaker to gain information from the addressee”
(1985:156). I define Duna interrogative sentences as those that contain an interrog-
ative word (§3.9)4 and/or the interrogative marker =pe (§11.1.3.2). They are derived
from declarative or optative sentences; in this section I exemplify interrogatives that
are derived from declarative sentences only, including three basic structures: yes-no
interrogatives (§11.1.3.3), alternative interrogatives (§11.1.3.4), and question word
interrogatives (§11.1.3.5).
    Interrogative sentences typically function as questions. In prototypical question
situations the speaker: does not know something (or does not know it for sure),
expects the addressee does know it, and asks the addressee to tell them this inform-
ation (or to confirm it). In some situations an interrogative sentence can be used
as a ‘rhetorical’ question, for which an answer is not expected. The speaker does
not ask the addressee to fill a gap in his or her knowledge, but may use an inter-
rogative to convey an attitude (for example, surprise, criticism) towards a situation,
and/or draw the addressee’s attention to something (see, for example, (222)-(224)
in §5.3.3.2).
   This section also describes a further minor sentence type, the ‘speculative’ (§11.1.3.6).
This type is defined on the basis of final predicate morphology, comprising those
   4
     A possible exception to this is where interrogative words appear to be used in construction with
other morphemes as indefinite pronominals (see example (360)). Too few examples exist in the data
to pursue this issue further.

sentences that are marked with the uncertainty maker -rape (§9.3.3.2), or the epi-
stemic particles =koae and =nokoae (§10.4.3). In these cases the marker =pe also
occurs, but is not really productively applied, as in the case of -rape it is represented
as a frozen component of the morpheme, and in the case of (no)koae is basically a
required element of independent use of these forms (unless an interrogative word
is present in the sentence). Speculative sentences are like interrogative sentences
in that the speaker expresses ignorance of the proposition, and encourages the ad-
dressee to have a look at what they know about it. However, unlike typical contexts
of interrogative sentences there is little expectation that the addressee knows the
answer and will be able to respond definitively.","[443, 444]"
"9.3.3.3    Dramatic markers
The morphemes -raka and -rakunu/-rakuru (‘DRAMA’) are added to final verb pre-
dicates that describe past events and indicate that this event was (or is) surprising,
impressive, or contrary to expectations. I do not know what contrasts the three dif-
ferent forms express. The dramatic markers are added to the o-base of consonantal
verbs and, according to the very limited data available, to the i-base of wa-class
verbs and the a-base of partial members of the wa-class group. There is no evid-
ence that the dramatic markers can occur as ancillary markers; in my data they are
only used as inflectional forms. Further data and analysis are required to better un-
derstand the meanings of the dramatic markers and the range of structures they may
occur in.
    An example of -raka is shown in (845), taken from a story in which two women
are busy eating and are unaware that two men are approaching until they are sud-
denly upon them. The final verb kundu- refers to a loud noise. It is noticeable that
-raka and rakur(/n)u often mark noisy events.(845)     ho-na     ruka-ta        na-ya ka-roko,         anene roma-ra-ka

light a fire, and flings him over a cliff.

gested an additional theme of marking a situation in which something unusual that
had been speculated about is incontrovertibly confirmed. For example, PK sugges-
ted the sentence shown in (847) might be used by someone who had heard about
the way kangaroos jump and then actually seen it for the first time. Using -raka
is emphatic, an assertion that ‘it really happened!’, even though it initially seemed
unlikely.(847)    kangaru-na-ka            phoko-raka.
         kangaroo.lw-SPEC-CS jump-DRAMA
         ‘Wow, the kangaroo really jumped!’ (CED/VIII:144)    Example (848) shows an overheard sentence concerning a man’s death by drown-
ing. This news had circulated as a rumour earlier in the day, and the speaker had
then been out and returned with confirmation of the incident.(848)    anoa-na ene kone          khene-raka.
         man-SPEC true INTENS die-DRAMA
         ‘The man really died!’ (OH/VIII:127)     In the case of -rakur(/n)u, some Duna speakers have explicitly said that it is
used to make a story sound better and more exciting. In the textual data this form
rarely occurs in texts from younger speakers.51 Some more examples of -raka and
rakur/nu are shown in text excerpts (849) and (850). These describe points of high
drama in stories, situations where the true nature of a wicked protagonist is suddenly
revealed to a main sympathetic character. In (849), a cannibal woman had pretended
to be dead in order to lure a man to his death; now she rises from her grave. In the
story from which (850) is taken, a cannibal tricks and traps men by pretending to be
a little boy who needs help reaching grubs inside a split piece of wood; at the vital
moment he lets the halves of the piece of wood spring shut, catching his victim.(849)     a. sopa kaki-ra          ro-na-ka               kilikulu kilikulu kilikulu-raka.

    In sixteen noted examples in the textual data, only one of these is from a younger speaker, and
fourteen of them are from speakers (thought to be) over 50 years old.

9.3.4.1    Introduction
The ‘expective’ (§9.3.4.2) and ‘potential observation’ (§9.3.4.3) markers occur with
inflectional function only. These forms are rare in the textual data; I first became
aware of their existence from Giles (MSa).52 I collectively term these inflections the
‘provocative’ markers because they are used when the speaker wishes to provoke the
addressee’s attention towards the predicated activity in a particular way.
    The expective and potential observation inflections both allude to potential events.
In the case of the expective inflection, a clause that is so marked describes a potential
event that the speaker thinks the addressee should think about before taking a course
of action. In the case of the potential observation inflection, the potential event is
not the activity denoted by the verb itself, but the addressee’s potential witnessing
of this activity. I find it illuminating to think of these forms as being to do with a
kind of event modality (§8.2.1) that is oriented toward the addressee’s awareness of
the predicate event. The speaker expresses a modal attitude towards the addressee’s
knowledge store, indicating that the addressee either should know or could have
seen something, thus showing some commonality with impersonal evidentials.53 In
using these markers the speaker urges the addressee to take epistemic responsibility
for the predicated activity by either recognising it as a pertinent piece of informa-
tion that should inform their actions (expective), or considering the evidence of the
predicated activity that could be available to them (potential observation).54
  52
      Giles (MSa) terms the forms I label expective and potential observation as ‘general experience’
and ‘past known to speaker’, respectively. The latter term is transparent. She defines the use of the
‘general experience’ forms as being used “when a statement is based on the speaker’s knowledge
from his general experience of what has or will happen in a certain situation” (MSa:37).
   53
      Molochieva’s (2006) Chechen data, as presented in Bickel (2007), intimates that the special
addressee-directed construction evidential/mirative in this language has overtones of a (deontic)
modal attitude to the addressee’s knowledge, and expresses the speaker’s opinion that the addressee
‘must know’ or ‘must have noticed’ the predicated event.
   54
      A possibility remains that the provocative inflections evoke an impersonal viewpoint, rather
than specifically targeting epistemic features in regard to the addressee. That is, they may be more
appropriately paraphrased as something like ‘it could have been seen’ rather than ‘you could have
356                               Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
    The provocative inflections are commonly associated with two kinds of speech
acts, giving directives and eliciting information (see also §11.1). A verb inflected
as expective or potential observation rarely occurs utterance-finally in my data, as
in most cases the provocative clause is immediately followed by an instruction or
question for the addressee. These markers have somewhat intermediate status as
final verb inflections, and could alternatively be interpreted as a medial inflections.
Under either analysis it is necessary to make some additional stipulations concern-
ing their uses.559.3.4.2    Expective marker
The expective inflection marks events that the speaker thinks likely to happen or
likely to have happened. It additionally implies something of a warning or reproach
to the addressee, as it marks a situation that the speaker thinks the addressee should
already have paid attention to or considered. A warning implication (‘look out,
this bad thing could happen’ ) is particularly common, so that the expective usually
functions similarly to an ‘admonitive’ (for example, in Maidu Shipley 1964), or ‘ap-
prehensive’ (for example, in Australian languages.). However, the implication that
the marked clause represents a specifically negative consequence is not a necessary
feature (see (853) and (854)).
    With regular verbs, the marker -nanoko is added to the root. For consonantal
verbs, the form -nako is added to the a-base, and for wa-class verbs -nako is added
to the a-base form, or -nanako to the u-base.56
    Clauses that are marked with the expective inflection are commonly accom-
panied by an instruction, as in (851) - (854). The speaker immediately supplies
direction on how the addressee should act on the information they are being given.(851)     sapulu-na        sa-nako,      kua peli-pa.

          Context: The addressee is teasing a dog.
seen’. Further data are needed to explore this issue, for example concerning the acceptability of
second person subject with these forms.
   55
      It is significant that the provocative markers end in the sequence ko; the form -ko occurs as a
productive marker of subordination, following a final inflection (see, for example, (1012)). However,
in the case of the expective and potential observation markers it is not helpful to say that ko is
occurring as a marker of subordination, as it is not possible to coherently identify the sequences to
which it is added as productive inflectional forms.
   56
      Further data are needed to establish whether the two possibilities for wa-class verbs are con-
trastive. Giles’ data include only the a-base + nako option.

     The expective marker appears to be particularly suitable for when the speaker
is additionally somewhat frustrated with or surprised at the addressee for missing
some information that is obvious and/or highly pertinent to a current situation. This
is illustrated by examples (853) and (854). KK and RA were quite specific about
the situations that these utterances were appropriate to. They suggested that (853)
was suitable if I was running around looking for my pen and repeatedly asking
them where it was and if they had it, rather than asking another obvious person (my
partner Chris) if he had it. They agreed that (854) would be used if KK and RA had
asked me to fetch something they wanted from another person’s room, but I had
said that I couldn’t because the door might be locked.","[382, 383, 384, 385, 386]"
"10.4.2   Indicating ‘opinion’ with =pi
The bound form =pi (OPIN) occurs following a final predicate to indicate that the
sentence proposition represents personal knowledge, opinion, or judgement (typic-
10.4. Epistemic particles                                                                   393
ally that of the informant).21 This form also occurs as an epistemic demonstrative
in referring expression such as NPs, see §6.2.
     The opinion marker =pi has no corresponding function as an inflectional form
that can supply time values to a verbal predication, but it serves a similar func-
tion to information status and evidential markers in that it makes claims about the
kind of knowledge that the proposition of the utterance represents. Like eviden-
tial markers, =pi is commonly followed by the specificity marker -na, and shows
a ‘viewpoint shift’ in declarative and interrogative sentences. In translation lines
I represent the import of =pi in curly brackets, as for evidential markers. The
verb I use for this is typically ‘opine’, which is I find a suitable approximation
of the meaning that =pi provides in most cases. The marker =pi can be con-
ceptually interpreted as a verb-like complement-taking predicate that has the in-
formant as a ‘opining/thinking/judging’ argument, and the marked sentence as a
‘opinion/thought/judgement’ argument. However =pi cannot be defined as a typ-
ical verbal root as it cannot occur as an independent predicate and does not bear
verbal inflection. Futher, the putative ‘thinker’ is not independently referenced in
the clause as a subject argument NP (although he or she may be coidentified with
the subject of the verbal predication, as in (971)).
    As an ancillary marker that follows a final predicate, the opinion marker =pi
typically implies that the speaker has a reasoned basis for their opinion; it does
not necessarily have any connotation of uncertainty. Using =pi appears to be most
appropriate to situations where the speaker personally regards the proposition as
quite ‘self-evident’, but does not anticipate that the addressee has arrived at the same
opinion (perhaps because he or she does not have access to the same information
that the speaker does, or has failed to notice something). However, further work
is needed to establish the range of circumstances that =pi fits, and how it contrasts
with evidential and information status markers.
    Some examples of =pi following verbal predicates are shown in (970) - (973). In
these examples =pi is structurally analogous to an evidential or information status
marker in a complex final inflection construction as described in §10.2.2; for ex-
ample, preceding =pi the desiderative inflection -no refers to a need/desire of the
speaker concerning his or her own activities (see §10.2.2.3).(970)    ko hikĩ na-ka-ya,              phaka neya-nda=pi-na           ruwa-ta...

  21
     Fasu (Namo Me) has a post-verbal particle with the form /pi/ that has similar meaning to the
Duna =pi (May and Loeweke 1980). In both cases it seems plausible that the particle is related to
the Engan subgroup word /pi(i)/ ‘language’ (Lang 1973; Rule 1977; Lomas 1988), building on the
idea of thought as internal utterance.

"4.2.4.2     Fronting
An object or oblique may be fronted and occur first in the clause.26 Fronting typical-
ly indicates that a referring expression is pragmatically prominent and focussed in
some way. For example, the phrase may constitute information that fills a perceived
gap in the hearer’s knowledge; the fronted phrase is in ‘new’ (or ‘completive’) fo-
cus (Dik 1989:392). This is seen in examples (90) - (93) which show first a situ-
ation described in unmarked word order, and then three question and answer pairs
in which a missing participant is placed at the beginning of the answer sentence.
These sentences show fronting of an object NP (91), a PP headed by the instrument
postposition -ka ‘INSTR’ (92), and an NP marked with -ra ‘CNCL’ (93). PK judged
that these sentences would only be acceptable utterances as answers to the relevant
question.27 (90)     na       anda khou-ra            phuya ndu rowa-ka            so.

               2SG.CS what kill.PFV
               ‘What did you kill?’  24
      The definition of left dislocation is confined by some scholars (see e.g., Foley 2007:443) to
describing constructions that involve copying. Left movement (and typically also broken intonation)
that does not involve copying may be referred to as ‘topicalisation’. However I do not use the latter
term for this as I use the word ‘topical’ elsewhere in a somewhat different sense, and because it seems
appropriate to use a single term for both construction types in Duna as they function similarly.
   25
      Thus, my use of this term is broad, and does not refer specifically to situations in which the
constituent in question is is represented by a pronominal element (or zero anaphora) in the clause,
and by an NP in the right dislocated phrase.
   26
      This is of course only observable if a constituent that would be predicted to occur before the
fronted constituent is present in the clause. For example, an object that is the only NP in a clause
will be clause-initial but is not ‘fronted’.
   27
      In this ‘answer to a question’ situation, there is a preference for fronted participants to be overtly
marked as indefinite with the quantifier ndu (see also §5.2.3.3). For example, when I first suggested
the constituent arrangement shown in (92), I did not have ndu within the instrument-referent NP, and
this was corrected by PK who thought that the sentence sounded much better with ndu included.

tuted’ for another (Vallduvı́ 1992:71-2).28 In (94), the object NPs of a negative and
a positive clause are fronted and contrasted. The hypothetical context is that two
people are talking over who went to the market that day. (94) ko no na-ke-ya,              Manari no ke-o.

         ‘You I didn’t see, Manari I saw.’ (CED/VIII:171)    In textual data it is noticeable that fronting occurs within clauses that itemise
a set of parallel events, as in (95) and (96). In the examples the fronted NP is
underlined. Fronting maintains parallel structure across the clauses as the contrast
argument always occurs first, building up a set of items. (95) ndulu kone, ho-ra-me                   ra-ya,      ita yopo        ho-ra-me           yaki

         (T/YS:270205)
  28
     From the available data this kind of ‘contrastive’ fronting in Duna seems to correspond closely
to ‘parallel’ and ‘replacing’ contrastive focus within Dik’s (1989) typology. However, this is a
preliminary observation only as I do not know the full range of situations in which fronting may

Subjects, objects, possessors, and obliques may be left dislocated.29 In such con-
structions, it is typical for the left dislocated element to be something the speaker
assumes the hearer already knows about (but cannot otherwise identify), while the
remainder of the clause provides new information. A left dislocated constituent in
Duna thus corresponds to Foley’s (2007:404) definition of a topic, “the link which
ties the information communicated in this sentence with what has preceded”.30
    In (101) and (102),31 the left dislocated ‘links’ (shown in bold type) correspond
to things that have recently been introduced into the text. Morphological marking on
the left dislocated NP reflects the participant’s clause-internal semantic role and/or
  29
      In examples in the textual data, obliques are fronted with broken intonation, but are not copied.
I have not tested whether copying is possible for all kinds of oblique constituents.
   30
      Compare also Vallduvi’s ‘link’ elements in information structure that are necessarily sentence-
initial (1992:48), and “point toward the address in the hearer’s knowledge store under which the
information of the sentence must be entered” (1992:62).
   31
      In some instances letters are substituted for proper names because the names represent special-
ised knowledge and it is not appropriate for me to reproduce them.

salient item in the speech environment.(103)    hina, Laila ndu ngua.
         sw.pot PSN one give.IMP
         ‘Sweet potato, give Lila one.’ (OH/VII:23)    Left dislocation is also used in marking a topical participant that has not been
referenced (overtly or covertly) for several clauses and is being “revived or re-
established” as a “resumed topic” (Dik 1989:277).
  32
     In (102c), the speaker reiterates more precisely the meaning of no ame as used in the previous
sentences; that is, that the relationship goes back several generations. This sentence is not spoken
fluently but broken by several pauses. The status of these units as either left dislocated material or
afterthought expansions, or a combination of both, is not clear to me.
4.2. Participant reference in verbal clauses                                         125
   Example (104) shows an NP that is left dislocated when its referent is already
known but has not been mentioned for several clauses. The mother (antia) has not
been referenced (either overtly or through zero anaphora) for nine clauses.(104)     sei si-ya-ta         kho koro-ya-ta.         antia =kho, mondo-nda

          ‘[The father] took [the boy] and cooked him. The mother, planning to
          garden,...’ (T/RP:270405ia)    Example (105) is taken from a story that appears to be based on Jack and the
Beanstalk. The bean seed (mbatano eke) has been introduced into the narrative
previously and referred to several times when the main character (a boy) sees and
buys the bean at a market. It has not been referenced for six clauses which detail
the boy’s return home and his attempt to conceal his activities from his watchful
mother.(105)     kho ha      hoa-ta     ka-ta           mbatano eke-na    anda hane

          ‘He came quickly and the bean seed [he] planted it by the lower side of the
          house.’ (T/PK:080605ii)    The linking and reactivating functions of left dislocation are not distinct, as re-
activation builds on the fact that a participant is already known, that is, is a potential
link.","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154]"
"(833)     Monika =kho nu            ware-na.
          PSN       =3SG netbag weave-SPEC
          ‘(I see) Monica is weaving a bilum.’ (CD/III:25)     The association of na-marking with sight raises the issue of whether specificity
marking on final verbs should be construed as part of the visual evidential category
(§9.2.3).43 It is unproblematic to say that -na in some ways ‘fills a gap’ in the evid-
ential paradigm, which does not include a ‘current visual’ category morpheme (that
is, lacks a form that describes seeing as contemporaneous with utterance). How-
ever, it is important to recognise that -na does not treat the semantics of ‘sight’ in
the same way that visual evidential markers do. With evidential markers, there is
a strong implication that the subject argument is someone other than the informant
(see, for example, (1062)). A visual evidential implies observation rather than par-
ticipation. However, with na-marking there is no such implication, and this marker
occurs freely in declarative sentences with first person subjects; see examples (827)
and (830).
     I turn now to an issue of analysis that I do not explore in detail in this thesis,
but which is significant to the development of a more comprehensive description
of the Duna language. In examples (827) - (833) I identify the form -na that is
added to an uninflected verb root as the specificity marker, that is, the same form
  43
    One argument that can be brought against this is that being able to physically see the predicated
event is not an absolute prerequisite of the morpheme’s deployment, as shown by its use with the
predicate khou ‘pain’ in (828), for which there is no clear visual manifestation, or in (832) where
-na occuring on a ‘sound’ verb that represents a birdcall. However, this latter example at least is, if
anything, supportive of an evidential interpretation as it is redolent of the use of the perfective visual
evidential marker in indexing the witnessing of sonic events (see example (756) in §9.2.3.2).
9.3. Information status markers                                                                345
that is used to indicate that the referent of a nominal phrase is a specific (and typic-
ally definite) individual (§6.3.2.1). As is shown in the following chapter, -na SPEC
can also be added following an inflected final verb in a main clause, with similar
‘attention-drawing’ implications. There are also a number of complex constructions
in Duna in which the specificity marker -na is added to a verb (inflected or other-
wise). These include for example: relative clauses (see (682), (394)); background
reason/cause clauses (in which case the clause is overtly marked with either =nia,
-ka, or -ta, see (704), (574)); nominalised purpose clauses (often on verbs that are
marked with -noi, see (800)); complement clauses headed by the verb wa- ‘do’ (see
(345), (448)); and other reified propositions, where the activity described by the
clause is nominalised as a named situation (994) or process (30). In these cases the
verb to which -na is added can generally be regarded as heading an embedded, sub-
ordinate, and/or nominalised clause rather than an independent verbal clause. The
additional use of a SPEC-marked clause as an independent utterance seems to be an
example of ‘insubordination’ (Evans 2007).
    It can be noted in examples (827) to (833) (and elsewhere) that I typically
treat definite-marked final verbs that are sentence-final as heads of ordinary verbal
clauses. However it follows that if -na is an NP marker, its use in final clauses could
be more appropriately described as a nominalisation construction that is function-
ally related to information status, rather than an example of a potentially inflectional
information status marker. A sentence such as (830) could be analysed as a ‘non-
embedded nominalization’ (Matisoff 1972) and rendered as ‘(It is the case that) I
am spinning yarn!’, or as a cleft construction, ‘It is I who am spinning yarn!’. A
comprehensive assessment of this issue demands a thorough description of com-
plex constructions, as well as an explicit account of information structure in Duna
conversation and extended discourse, areas that I do not embark upon in this thesis
owing to time and data constraints. As a practical measure, I treat -na SPEC as it
occurs in main clauses as a morpheme that is functionally equivalent to an informa-
tion status marker, as it can: derive a finite predicate, ascribe temporal value (present
time) to the clause in which it occurs, and convey an attitude (a judgement/assertion
of ‘noteworthiness’) to the information that is encoded in the utterance.44 I translate
final verbs that are marked with the specificity marker as if they are heads of main
verbal clauses unless there is uncontroversial indication that the clause is not inde-
  44
      cf. Woodbury (1985): In examining ‘participle constructions’ in Yup’ik Eskimo that can occur
either as noun phrases or as independent clauses, Woodbury says that: “When participle construc-
tions function as clauses [...] the participle suffixes act as mood markers. Rather than convert the
verb base to which they attach into adjectival nouns, they become part of their inflection as verbs.
[...] In addition to looking like mood markers, participle suffixes have mood meaning. They signal
vividness and sometimes exclamatory force in main clauses, forming a paradigm set with the other
main clause moods” (1985:76).

pendent but is part of a larger complex sentence structure; for example if the marked
clause bears a specific function in a matrix clause (cf. Bickel 1999:3), or is overtly
marked as a clause of purpose or reason (etc.). This is not entirely satisfactory, but
is adequate for my basic descriptive purposes.
    It is of interest to note that the Duna use of the specificity marker on final
verbs in independent clauses shows some structural and functional similarity to
non-embedded nominalisations in several Tibeto-Burman language subgroups (for
example, Kiranti and Bodic), in which a morpheme that is used in nominalisa-
tion operations (and in some cases also functions as a singular definite article in
noun phrases) marks main clauses in attention-drawing, emphatic and/or ‘constat-
ive’ (“it’s a fact”) utterances.45 More generally, these ‘nominalisations’ are probably
examples of insubordination, the independent use of an apparently (or erstwhile)
subordinate structure (Evans 2007). Two functions of insubordination identified by
Evans that are of particular relevance to the Duna and Bodic examples are the ex-
pression of epistemic and evidential meanings, and the signalling of presupposed
material.","[373, 374, 375]"
"11.2.4.2     Prohibitive, hortative, and desiderative
The prohibitive, hortative, and desiderative morphemes occur as final inflections in
optative sentences (§11.1.4), exemplified in §8.2.2.4 and §8.2.4. These inflections
also occur in interrogatives that function as requests for permission or queries as to
what it would be best to do. Typically, the speaker asks the addressee whether he
or she supports an activity that the speaker intends to carry out. This is exemplified
in (1126) and (1127a) (with the hortative inflection) and (1128) and (1129) (with
the prohibitive inflection).29 An assent to a hortative imperative request is typic-
ally couched as an imperative (§8.2.4.1) as shown in (1127b). The prohibitive and
hortative only occur in yes-no interrogatives in the current data.(1126)     na       ke-wae=pe.
           1SG.CS see-HORT=Q
         ‘May I see?’ (SD/III:60)
  29
     Giles suggests that these two constructions maintain the immediate/deferred contrast as for dir-
ective utterances (§8.2.4.6), the hortative being an immediate request for permission and the pro-
hibitive a deferred request (that is, for something that the speaker would like to do later rather than
straight away). This seems a sensible analysis and is not contradicted by the 2003-7 data, but I have
no contrastive examples that clearly confirm it.

         ‘May I not cut your pandanus?’ (ED/VII:14)    In (1126) - (1129) the subject is the speaker. This contrasts with non-interrogative
use of these inflections, in which the subject is the addressee (in the case of the pro-
hibitive) and typically the speaker + the addressee (in the case of the hortative). The
hortative/interrogative can also be used in suggestions regarding group activities, as
in (1130).(1130) hina piriri koro-wae=pe.
          food all    steambake-HORT=Q
         ‘Shall [we] cook all the food?’ (ED/V:102)    There are also a few examples in the data of the desiderative marker -no oc-
curring in an (question word) interrogative utterance, in which case the subject is
the speaker, as shown in (1131) and (1132). This does not appear to be a common
construction, and all but one of the recorded examples come from a rather special
situation, a mourning song where the singer (Kipu Piero) directly addresses the
deceased, a close female friend (see Gillespie 2007b:Chapter 4).(1131) no pa-ka           nga-no=pe.

         ‘Who is there as a friend that I may go to (now that you, my dearest friend,
         are dead)?’ (Gillespie 2007b:261, gloss added)    Of these three inflections, the prohibitive and desiderative can be identified as
bearing some relationship to disjunct distribution, as there is a predictable alterna-
tion between a non-speaker subject (in optative sentences) and a speaker subject (in
450                               Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
interrogative sentences). For the hortative, the situation is muddied; the hortative
typically has an inclusive speaker + addressee subject in optative sentences and a
speaker subject in interrogative sentences, but these are not the only options (see,
for example, (706)). However, the fact that there is ‘something going on’ in rela-
tion to a non-speaker/speaker subject switch in all cases suggests that someone who
supplies (or is asked to supply) deontic attitudinal rather than propositional inform-
ation is included as a kind of informant. As with the evidential markers (§11.2.2)
and the prophetic inflection (§11.2.3), the prohibitive, hortative and desiderative
morphemes, broadly speaking, imply a non-informant subject.

11.3     Epistemic assessment and the final predicate: an overview
In this thesis I have described a range of bound forms that express epistemic as-
sessment meanings, including evidential markers, information status markers, and
epistemic particles. These are used by a speaker in indicating how they and others
are positioned in relation to the propositional content of an utterance as knowledge.
They frame the utterance with respect to such questions as: does it represent know-
ledge that was gained through a particular kind of perceptual experience? Is the
proposition a state or event that other people can independently observe and know?
    In this concluding section I summarise certain formal, semantic, and functional
characteristics of these forms, consider the issue of whether these groups should be
gathered together as members of a superordinate formal-functional category, and
comment on the nature of epistemic assessment as an obligatory or optional com-
ponent of final predicate morphology.
    Bound evidential markers (§9.2) target ‘information source’ as their primary
semantic domain. Evidential markers do not co-occur and can be arranged as a
paradigmatic set that encodes a set of contrasts with respect to three parameters:
the evidence category (one of four possibilities derived from the features ‘seen’
and ‘direct’), personal vs impersonal evidence and current vs previous evidence.
The forms of the morphemes typically show some relationship to each other, for
example, the sequence nua recurs in the impersonal evidential forms for each cat-
egory (and does not occur as a component of other inflectional forms). Evidential
markers can typically function as both primary inflectional and ancillary forms.30
    Information status markers (§9.3) indicate features that relate to the incor-
poration of information into the presumed ‘knowledge store(s)’ of the discourse
participants speaker and addressee. They are typically used by a speaker to advise
an addressee on how they should treat the proposition encoded in the utterance, for
example as something that is familiar to them or as something that is particularly
noteworthy. Information status markers do not represent a category of formally
equivalent morphemes, although they are functionally comparable. They all oc-
cur as primary verbal inflections and some may also function as ancillary markers.
Some information status markers can occur in combination with some evidential
markers.
   Epistemic particles (§10.4) indicate features that are relevant to the semantic
domains of information source and/or information status, for example, that a pro-
position is a reasoned judgment of the speaker, or is something hypothetical that
cannot be directly verified. Epistemic particles do not occur as verbal inflections,
  30
     Note however that, excepting for the sensory category marker, impersonal evidentials are not
attested as ancillary markers.

"9.2.3.3    Visual (stative previous)
The stative visual previous morpheme -rua marks states that the perceiver observed
to be the case before the time of utterance. In conversational use, the stative visual
shows something of a temporal split between the predicate activity and the evidence
for it, as the former is generally understood to be ‘present’ (still continuing at the
time of utterance, as far as the speaker knows), but the visual evidence itself is no
longer within the perceptual sphere of the discourse participants. The marker typic-
ally only occurs as a primary inflection on the three major existential verbs (Table
3.6), but is, albeit rarely, used on other verbs that have an inherently stative sense
(for example, kuwa- ‘carry’, see (482), and see also (762), following). It attaches to
the a-base of consonantal, semi-consonantal, and wa-class verbs.15 Examples are
shown in (758) and (759).(758)     guapa rowa ndu ka-rua.
          guava.lw tree one stand-STAT.VIS . P
          ‘There is a guava tree {I saw}.’ (CC/VIII:59)(759)     phekeriti-tia, [...] khao rindi-ta           ra-rua.
          factory.lw-PL         redskin ground-LOC be/put-STAT.VIS . P
          ‘Factories, [...] they exist in European places {I saw}.’ (T/SN:101203i)    In (758) and (759) the speaker is reporting having seen something that is not
present at the time of utterance, but is assumed to still exist. Example (760) is
taken from a narrative. The use of the stative visual previous marker reflects the
evidential category that is appropriate to a central protagonist in the story (a young
woman), but the evidence time specification of ‘previous’ reflects narrative-external
time; that is, this perception event, the young woman seeing the boy sitting there,
happened before the telling of the story.
  15
     The issue of whether -rua can ever be used as a final inflection on verbs that have more inher-
ently progressive meanings requires further testing. I do recall attempting to combine -rua with the
a-base of the verb nga- ‘go’ in conversation (i.e., nga-rua) and this being categorically rejected as
incorrect by my interlocutor, but unfortunately I did not record this incident while it was still fresh
in my mind.

"9.2.4.2    Sensory (current)
The sensory current morpheme -yarua indicates that an event is experienced as
sensory evidence at the time of utterance. It is added to the a-base of consonantal
and semi-consonantal verbs, the i-base of wa-class verbs, and the i-base or a-base
of partial members of the wa-class group.
    Examples (763) and (764) show two uses of the sensory (current) with auditory
evidence.18(763)     Alo antia-ka Alo ya-yarua.
          PSN mother- CS PSN call- SNS . C          ‘Alo’s mother is calling Alo {I hear}.’ (T/HS:080305ii)(764)     rũ   okoko angu         waki-pa. nga-yarua.

          (ED/VIII:130)    Examples (765) - (767) show the sensory current morpheme being used in pre-
dications that describe physical and/or emotional sensations. In (768) the negative
circumfix (§8.3) is also present, applied prior to the evidential marker.(765)     ima     ndu-ka no yaka ri-rape, no khonane õ-yarua.

    Note that in (763) the speaker uses auditory evidence (the faintness of sound of the plane’s
engine) to make an inference — that the plane is flying past rather than coming in to land.

    Example (769) shows a situation in which the sensory evidence morpheme
marks a thought or surmise of the speaker about a current activity. PK used this
sentence in the (real life) context of seeing a particular kind of smoke in the dis-
tance, from which he inferred that someone was burning a particular kind of tree.(769)     nane ndu alupati khira-yarua.

          ‘A boy is burning alupati foliage {I infer}.’ (LC/IX:28)9.2.4.3    Sensory (perfective previous)
The perfective sensory previous morpheme -yaritia is added to the a-base of con-
sonantal and semi-consonantal verbs, the i-base of wa-class verbs, and the i-base or
a-base of partial members of the wa-class group. The perfective sensory previous
is generally used in a narrower range of situations than the sensory current marker.
For example it is rarely used to express ‘inferential’ meaning, as for past events
inference is primarily marked by other morphemes (§9.2.5). Some examples which
involve auditory evidence are shown in (770)-(773).(770)     ka-roko,      ya phuka ndu hoa-yaritia.

-yaritia was wholly suitable for describing past states without such time reference,
as these are otherwise more appropriately described using the imperfective sensory
previous evidential, see the following section.
    In the recorded sung pikono performances in the 2003-5 data (§1.3.3.1), per-
formers make extensive use of set ‘narrative refrains’ that are generally placed
at the end of a grammatical unit such as a clause, and reiterate that the text is
a performed story. Each performer uses slightly different narrative refrains, and
RA reported to me that these are a kind of ‘performer signature’ (see also Fleck
(2007:605) concerning a similar phenomena in Matses stroytelling). Two of the
recorded performers include the form yaritia as component of one or all of their
narrative refrains, but in these cases the morpheme functions as an ancillary or even
quasi-independent form rather than a verbal inflection.","[348, 349, 350]"

As seen in the example sentences of sections §9.2.3 - §9.2.6, the perceiver of evid-
ence as encoded by evidential markers in statements is typically identified as the
speaker, or as a central character in a narrative. Each evidential category also has
a special form whereby the evidence is designated as ‘impersonal’ and generally
perceived (or perceivable) rather than specifically perceived by a particular person.
In most predicates marked as having impersonal evidence the speaker is understood
to share in this perception, but it is most appropriate to think of these markers as
  29
     Cf. Wilkins’ (1986) discussion of the Mparntwe Arrernte particle/clitics -itanye and kwele, and
how these are used in making criticisms of someone’s behaviour. The Arrernte clitics have some
semantic and functional commonality with the Duna notional previous, in that they can mark a
situation as surprising (-itanye), or as a distant report (kwele), and can be used in pointing out and
disparaging someone’s failure to behave in a certain appropriate way.
332                                Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers
expressing the perception as simply having a non-specified agent. This shift is con-
ceptually akin to paraphrasing the entailed perception event as passive and potential
rather than active and actualised. There is no time distinction of current versus
previous within the impersonal evidential markers, as it is problematic to contrast
the time reference of evidence unless it is being perceived at a particular time by a
particular person.
    The impersonal evidential forms are shown again in Table 9.3. Each form cor-
responds to one of the evidential markers of the same evidence category as described
in §9.2.3 - §9.2.6, the sequence rua in the personal form corresponding to nua in
the impersonal form.30 The impersonal evidence morphemes are added to the same
base forms of consonantal and wa-class verbs as described for the corresponding
personal forms described in the previous sections.","[360, 361]"
"8.2.3.3    Prophetic future
The prophetic inflection -na20 (terminology after Giles (MSa)) occurs on verbs that
describe predicted future events (typically those for which the informant is not re-
sponsible). This suffix is applied to the a-base of all consonantal and wa-class
verbs, including partial members. Some examples are shown in (669) - (671). The
sentence-final assertion marker =nia that occurs in these examples is described in
§11.1.2.1.(669)     no eya-na         pingipongo-na=nia, ha-me-wei.

          2SG once man good one-PR man go-PROPH=ASSERT
          ‘One day you will marry [lit. man go] with a good man.’ (CED/XIV:135)    At least some Duna speakers identify the prophetic inflection as marking events
that will specifically be seen in the future. In our work together it was common for
KK, PK, and RA (among others) to translate predicates marked with this morpheme
as see-complements in Tok Pisin and English. For example, the sentence shown in
(670) would be translated as ‘You will see he will travel around in the sky.’
    The prophetic inflection is normally only appropriate with non-informant sub-
jects (non-speaker in declaratives and non-addressee in interrogatives). That is, it is

     The habitual and prophetic inflections are segmentally identical but contrast in pitch. For ex-
ample, with a monosyllabic root that is specified for rising pitch (i.e., shows an [lm] contour in the
perfective inflection): application of the habitual inflection results in the contour [mh.ml], with a
mid-high rise on the verb root, and a mid-low fall on the final na; application of the prophetic in-
flection results in the contour [m.m(l)], with level pitch on the verb root and level or mid-low falling
pitch on na.

     It remains difficult to propose derivations for the evidential markers that work
well throughout the set and for all verb classes. For example, although replacing rua
with tia results in a change of temporal specification (from current to imperfective
previous) in the sensory evidentials (Table 10.5), this is not a consistent alternation
that is observable elsewhere: the forms rua and tia also contrast within the visual
category, but the meaning of this alternation (stative previous versus perfective pre-
vious) is different to that which is found in the sensory category markers, and in the
results and notional evidence categories there is no comparable alternation at all.
Additionally, there are complications concerning the fact that markers within the
same evidential category show irregularities. For example, the hypothetical devel-
opment of the results marker outlined in (1015) is perhaps plausible for consonantal
verbs, but not for regular or wa-class verbs, which receive the form rei (rather then
ri), and do not show any expression of perfective aspect on the verb stem, as rei
is directly attached to the uninflected verb root or the i-base form. The origin of
the regular/wa-class resultative inflection suggests a different derivation from that
of consonantal verbs.29
     Overall, the forms of the evidential markers suggest that the paradigm as presen-
ted in Table 9.1 is developing piecemeal, put together from a collection of inflec-
tional and complex structures that are drawn into relationships of opposition (for
example, previous versus current time) that are reasonably constant throughout the
set. However, some of the oppositional relationships are aberrant, as forms that be-
long to the same evidential category may encode a distinction that is not sustained
throughout the paradigm, or skip one of the paradigmatic contrasts. For example, as
inflectional forms the visual category evidentials encode an aspectual distinction as
regards the predicate event, but do not express the previous/current contrast. This
  28
      Beyond noting that this is homophonous with the general predicating medial inflection -ya
‘DEP’, I am not able to suggest an original meaning for this form.
   29
      In the case of the regular forms, a likely source is an erstwhile serialisation construction (§7.3)
that indicated perfect aspect, in which a form of the existential verb era- ‘be/put’ occurred as Vlast ,
following a regular or wa-class verb. Recall that, although it is not attested as a final verb form
(being supplanted by the special stative form iri), ‘be/put’ has the i-base form (e)rei.

kind of lopsidedness is perhaps partly what drives the incorporation of construc-
tions into the system as (quasi-)inflectional forms. Such a process would probably
be recursive, as incorporation may create a new semantic gap even as it fills another.
Chapter 11Final morphology and sentence type
In this chapter I explore the meanings and functions of certain bound morphemes
(TAM markers, evidential markers, information status markers, and epistemic particles)
with respect to the illocutionary type of the sentence in which they occur. In par-
ticular, I look at differences in meanings and extended implications of predicate
markers that are associated with interrogative as opposed to non-interrogative sen-
tences. The category of ‘interrogative’ is particularly significant to a discussion of
epistemic assessment (Chapters 9 and 10), because the typical speech act function
of an interrogative sentence is that of a question, and couching a proposition as a
question is expressive of certain ideas about knowledge and how it is differentially
distributed between speaker and addressee.
    Section 11.1 gives an overview of sentence types in Duna, and introduces two
further sentence-final bound forms that are associated with declarative and interrog-
ative sentences. In §11.2 I examine and exemplify particular features of predicate
morphology that shift according to whether a sentence is interrogative or not, fo-
cussing on the implications of certain final predicate markers as concerns subject
identity and volition. In §11.3 I provide an overview of issues concerning epistemic
assessment and the final predicate, drawing together material presented in this and
preceding chapters.","[436, 437, 438]"
"9.3.2.3    Overview of the expression of present time events
We have now looked at the full range of known Duna morphemes that can occur as
primary inflections on final verbs in the expression of (non-habitual) present time
events, first introduced in Table 8.3 and reproduced here as Table 9.6.46 The group
includes three TAM forms (one of which is applicable to wa-class and consonantal
verbs only), four visual and non-visual sensory evidential markers, the individual
standpoint information status marker -pa, and specificity marker -na (the last two
being applicable only to regular verbs). The morphemes are formally and semantic-
ally disparate, but also functionally contrastive, and can be though of as providing
a speaker with a finite set of choices in regard to the (maximally simple) expression
of a situation that holds at the time of utterance.
  45
      For example, in detailing the functions of nominalising morphology in Bodic languages (a pos-
tulated genetic grouping within Tibeto-Burman), Noonan (2008) notes that: “when nominalizations
[i.e., constructions headed by nominalisations or forms morpholgically identical to them] appear as
main clauses, the typical effect is one of mirativity, i.e. the sense that the predication so expressed
is in some sense surprising, contrary to expectation, or in some way exasperating”. In discussing
Kiranti languages (Tibeto-Burman), Bickel (1999) argues that the use of nominalisation markers on
non-embedded clauses represents a focus construction. Such constructions may be used in Belhare,
for example: “to instantiate a controversial discourse variable” (for example, in an utterance that
emphatically rejects a suggestion or insinuation made by an interlocutor); in the instantiation of an
open variable (completive focus) where “a speaker claims her proposition to be the definite answer
to the question”; or to re-instantiate a variable in narrative in order to “ascertain that the audience is
fully aware of the proposition and does not doubt it any further” (Bickel 1999).
   46
      The special present form of nga- ‘go’ (ngui) is not included in the array, as it is only applicable
to one verb. However, in relation to later discussion in this section, the fact that this inflection only
occurs in sentences with volitional informant subjects means there is a good argument to be made
that it encodes participatory semantics.

    Figure 9.1 shows one way that these forms can be arranged as a system of in-
flectional options, albeit one that draws its components from diverse sources (des-
ignations in parentheses are explained and discussed subsequently).
    As a first choice, a verb that denotes a present-time event can be inflected with a
form that makes reference to unseen information source (a SNS category evidential
marker) or one that does not. If a SNS marker is selected, a further distinction
between personal and impersonal evidence (§9.2.2.2) is possible. Otherwise, further
selection is made between other TAM, evidential, and information status markers.
    If the event described is a state, this can be expressed as something that was
visually witnessed prior to the time of utterance, in which case the choice between
personal and impersonal evidence is again brought into play. Otherwise, the stative
TAM marker can be used (§8.2.3.1). If the event is non-stative, it becomes import-
ant to identify the class of the verb that denotes this event. If the verb is regular, it
may be marked as representing individual knowledge (§9.3.2.1), or as expressing a
situation that is specific and noteworthy. Typically this is something that the speaker
thinks can or should be immediately observed by the interlocutor (§9.3.2.2). Altern-
atively, if the verb is a member of the consonantal or wa-class verbs, it is simply
marked as denoting an imperfective event through use of the imperfective stem
(§8.2.2.2).

    In addressing the status of the ‘other’ designations within Figure 9.1, the pos-
sibility of treating information source as an obligatorily expressed domain in verbal
inflection becomes relevant, as discussed with respect to past time events in §9.2.9.
The choice between SNS markers and other forms can be expressed as a selec-
tion between two kinds of information source: that which is ‘firsthand’, compris-
ing visuo-perceptive, participatory, and factual information source; and that which
is ‘non-firsthand’, comprising non-visuo-perception, and being extended to certain
kinds of inference concerning ongoing events (as illustrated in (769) in §9.2.4.2).47
Under the ‘stative’ node the distinction can again be characterised as one that is
entirely to do with information source, ‘visual’ versus ‘participatory/factual’.
    Under this reading, inflectional options that relate to present-time situations
comprise a functional paradigm within which evidentiality is an obligatory gram-
matical category: a speaker has a finite set of morphological options, all of which
encode information source. As for the perfective inflection, whether or not TAM
markers such as a the stative and imperfective inflections do indeed encode inform-
ation source is something of a moot point, and further data are needed to examine
this issue. There is some evidence to support the view that these forms are ‘pos-
itively’ evidential (for example, the fact that they can, like evidential markers, be
followed by -na SPEC, see §10.2) and some evidence against it (for example, the
fact that IPFV can occur in combination with evidential markers, and that the stative
inflection can be followed by epistemic particles).
    Regardless of whether or not these forms are identified as necessarily evidential
morphemes, it can be seen that the parameter of information source (like that of
aspect as outlined in §8.2.3.7) has quite a profound effect concerning the possible
articulation of possible primary inflections as a system or group of subsystems, and
is a particularly important factor within the inflectional inventory.","[375, 376, 377, 378]"
"11.2.3.4     ‘Impossible proposition’ interrogatives
Hale (1980) says that in rhetorical questions in Newar, conjunct and disjunct verb
forms follow the declarative rather than typical interrogative distributional pattern.
This is seen in (1115a), in which an addressee subject occurs with a disjunct verb
form, and (1115b), in which a speaker subject occurs with a conjunct verb form,
despite the fact that these examples are interrogative (as indicated by the marker
la). These sentences are not ‘true questions’ because they are not genuine requests
for information; rather, the speaker asserts that the proposition is not the case.(1115)      a. cha ana wala                lā?
               you there come.DISJUNCT INTER .
              ‘Did you come?’ (i.e., most certainly not!)
           b. ji ana wanā              lā?
              I there went.CONJUNCT INTER .
              ‘Did I go there?’ (i.e., I most certainly did not!) (NEWAR: Hale (1980),
              gloss added)    Duna appears to function similarly to Newar, disrupting the usual distributional
pattern of the intentive and prophetic inflections in interrogatives for rhetorical ef-
fect. Interrogatives formed in this way express strong doubt (yes-no interrogatives),
and/or suggest that there is no possible candidate to fill the ‘missing participant’ slot
(question word interrogatives). That is, the proposition is implied to be impossible.
For example, the (constructed) interrogative (1116) combines an addressee subject
with the prophetic inflection. My Duna consultant Timon Kangapu thought that
this could only be used in a situation where there speaker wished to imply that the

    The issue of ‘privileged access’ with relation to Newar conjunct verb forms is discussed in
Hargreaves (2005).
11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity                     445
addressee would certainly not be able to go; for example, as an implied threat when
the addressee is planning to leave home in order to avoid legal action brought by the
speaker. Example (1117) shows a rhetorical interrogative with a speaker subject.(1116) ko Mospi nga-na=pe.
           2SG PLN      go-PROPH=Q
        ‘You’re going to Moresby??!’ (i.e., you certainly aren’t!) (CD/XIV:85)(1117) ngoya pa-na            wa-nda=pe.
           go.IPFV query-SPEC do-INT=Q       say-DEP
        ‘Where will I go?’ (i.e., there is nowhere) (P/AM:NH0312A)    As seen in the preceding section, interrogatives with third person and questioned
subjects do not conform to the typical conjunct/disjunct distributional pattern. Rhet-
orical interrogatives are not formally distinguished as they are with speaker and ad-
dressee subjects, but are interpreted as such from context. Example (1118) is taken
from a text in which the speaker describes how she, her siblings, and her mother
were abandoned by her father and lived without the support of adult male relatives;
there is no man to butcher their pigs.(1118) ayu ita ha-tia anoa ai-ka           paka-nda=pe ha-me        ri-ya...
           now pig there-GP man who-CS butcher-INT=Q there-MNR say-DEP
        ‘Now what man will butcher those pigs? she says...’ (i.e., there is no-one)
        (T/KP:061103)11.2.3.5    Further comments on intentive declaratives
My data include some examples of declarative sentences in which the intentive in-
flection does not reflect typical distribution with respect to subject identity, that is,
it occurs with non-speaker subjects. Some of these are reproduced and discussed in
this section.
    One situation in which it may be appropriate for the intentive inflection to occur
in a declarative with a non-speaker subject is in the description of a situation that is
desired by the speaker, as in (1119) and (1120).(1119) inu      hapia aru       ka-na-ra-me               ayu memba
           1/2PL before take.care be/stand-HAB-SHRD-MNR now member.lw

        after us the way we were looked after previously.’ (T/SN:101203i)(1120) ko nga-nda.
           2SG go-INT
        ‘(I want that) you will go.’ (CD/XIV:181)
446                                   Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence type
         (RA translated this constructed sentence as shown, commenting that it could be
         used in a situation where the speaker has to choose somebody to send as a messen-
         ger.)    Some other examples suggest that a speaker can use the intentive inflection to
reflect the fact that they are an authoritative informant by virtue of a close asso-
ciation with a third person subject. This is illustrated by the constructed example
shown in (1121). Line (1121a) shows the typical declarative pattern of third person
subject and a predicate that is inflected as prophetic. On being asked whether the
intentive inflection (1121b) might also be suitable, PK reflected that it could be used
“if you live with those people” whereas (1121a) would be used “if you haven’t seen
them”.(1121)     a. anita =khunu yapenengi pi         itupanengi pi   Mospi nga-na.
              gang =3PL         Tuesday    LNK Wednesday LNK PLN       go-PROPH
            ‘They will go to Moresby on Tuesday or Wednesday.’ (I haven’t been
            with these people)
         b. anita =khunu yapenengi pi itupanengi pi Mospi nga-nda.
             gang =3PL         Tuesday    LNK Wednesday LNK PLN       go-INT
             ‘They will go to Moresby on Tuesday or Wednesday.’ (I live with these
             people) (CD/III:60)    Similarly, example (1122) shows a fragment of conversation (between myself
and two others) about whether or not a toddler would eat some food that I had
prepared. The toddler’s mother, Speaker B, replies to my question (1122a) using the
intentive inflection in (1122b). The other person, no relation to the child, repeats
the substance of the mother’s answer using the prophetic inflection as shown in
(1122c). I speculate that this reflects an understanding that the mother can ‘speak
for’ the child, whereas the other person does not claim this right. However, more
evidence is needed to test this hypothesis.(1122)     a. LSR: na-nda=pe, na-na-ya-nda.
                     eat-INT=Q     NEG -eat- NEG - INT
             Will [he] eat, or not?
         b. Spr A: na-nda.
                     eat-INT
             ‘[He] will eat.’
         c. Spr B: na-na=nia,             ngua.
                    eat-PROPH=ASSERT give.IMP
             ‘[He] will eat, give [it].’ (LC/VIII:33)   The use of the intentive inflection in examples such as (1121b) and (1122b) can
additionally be interpreted as relayed utterance, in which the speaker reproduces the
11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity                    447
speech or intention of a close associate with an assumed rather than overt ‘report’
frame.2811.2.3.6       Summary
Overall, the intentive inflection implies that an informant personally experiences an
event as an unrealised plan and is closely associated with the described situation.
Having a plan of something presupposes control (the informant is a volitional sub-
ject argument), desire (the informant wants the event to happen) and authority (the
informant has best access to knowledge of it). These features typically (and in some
cases necessarily) coincide, but may each be sufficient to independently motivate in-
tentive marking in some circumstances. It is most usual (and always grammatical)
for intentive marking to occur in declaratives with volitional speaker subjects and
interrogatives with volitional addressee subjects.
    The prophetic inflection alternatively draws attention to the actual manifesta-
tion of the event as something that will be perceivable in the future, and implies
disassociation from the described situation. The informant does not exert conscious
control over the event, and does not assert a relationship with the people involved.
This shows similarities to the disassociative implications of evidentials as described
in §11.2.2.6. It is most usual for prophetic marking to occur with third person sub-
jects in declaratives, but it may also occur (without rhetorical effect) with addressee
subjects in declaratives and speaker and third person subjects in interrogatives.","[473, 474, 475, 476]"

7.4     Verb adjuncts
7.4.1   Introduction
A verb adjunct construction (VAC) in Duna is a clause in which the predicate is
composed of a verb adjunct (§3.4) preceding a verb. The composition of a VAC
is represented in Figure 7.3. As in Figure 7.2, the ‘x’ symbol is used to mean
‘number of arguments’. Its placement here indicates that the argument structure of
the predicate is determined by the verb and verb adjunct in combination. The verb
adjunct and verb can be treated as a single root for the purposes of negation, or not,
as indicated by the fact that the plus sign in between the two is in brackets.",[265]
