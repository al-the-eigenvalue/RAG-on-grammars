need of marking them with respect to their discourse information

  “With a production time of almost seven years, this book would have
   taken too long had it been a script for a Hollywood movie. Fortunately,
  my field is that of Ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages studies,
  which,     —though   equally vibrant and glamorous    as the visual arts-,
   idevelops at a more relaxed pace. This leaves open the possibility of
   exploring new paths and approaching old problems from a different
   angle. The present book approaches Sahidic Coptic, the classical
  “dialect of Coptic Egyptian, from a modern linguistic perspective.
   Writing a comprehensive grammar of Sahidic Coptic that is of interest
      to both a broad linguistic and Egyptological readership is a rewarding
   though difficult task, given our incomplete knowledge of this language
   where many issues are far from resolved. Although there is still a long
   way to go, it has been my ambition to provide a well-balanced and
   coherent description of Sahidic Coptic that does justice to the complex
   design of the language system.
    “The humble beginnings of this book date back to Fall 1997, when I
   started working on a concise grammar of Sahidic Coptic that included
   up-to-date teaching material. The project with the cryptic name
    Coptogram’ was part of an interdepartmental program ‘renewal of
   teaching material’ of the Faculty of Arts of Leiden University, The
   Netherlands. I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the
   Faculty of Arts of my university.         ,

This book offers     a comprehensive    grammar     of Sahidic    Coptic, the
   main reference dialect of Coptic Egyptian. Coptic Egyptian (not to be
- confused with Egyptian Arabic) is the vernacular of late-antique and
‘ medieval Christian Egypt (from about the third to the eleventh century
  CE) and represents the final developmental stage of Ancient Egyptian.
   With its rich literary sources, Coptic is an ancient language of great
 ‘cultural importance. It also provides an interesting case of the
 ‘ emergence of a language through intensive contact (Egyptian-Greek)
 ‘in a bilingual speech community, For this reason, the study of the
 | Coptic language is of central interest for scientific disciplines as
 diverse   as Egyptology,   Ancient   History,   comparative     religion,   and
 various fields of linguistics (e.g. comparative Afroasiatic linguistics,
 language typology, historical syntax). This study therefore has a dual
 purpose: on the one hand, it serves as a teaching grammar for the
 language learner by providing an introduction to Sahidic Coptic. On
 the other hand, it contains the synthesis of extensive research on
 Coptic clause structure, which makes it a suitable reference tool for
 philologists and linguists alike.
   This introduction sets the stage ‘for the following description of
 Sahidic grammar by supplying some background information on the
 language, its historical development and its literary documentation. It

 same formal system, Coptic has not only an Imperative, but also a
 formally     distinct Jussive,        Conditional,            and Inferential mood.          These
 basic moods express the speaker’s attitude or belief concerning the
 likelihood, desirability, or necessity for some situation to occur.
  UNIT 9 examines the negative counterparts of the various verbal
 tenses, aspects and moods discussed in the preceding two units. The
 negative conjugation system shows a variety of patterns by means of
 which negative polarity is expressed. Such negative: markers may
 negate     an entire   clause,        but        may   also    be   more    limited    in scope,

              ‘This Unit addresses two interrelated topics: one concerns the Copto-
              Greek alphabet, i.e. the notation system in which Coptic texts have
             ‘been codified, and the other concems its sound system, or phonology.
cane         ‘Section 1.1 discusses the main aspects of Coptic orthography, while
             ‘section 1.2 presents several types of evidence for the pronunciation of a
       Nn,   4particular letter or gtapheme. There is not always a one-to-one
              correspondence between graphemes and phonemes, since some
              ‘phonemes may be expressed by more than one grapheme and, vice
              ‘versa, some graphemes may have more than one phonological

               particular attention for vowel length, syllable structure, and stress
             -|placement.
                . Section 1.4 addresses the question of language contact and linguistic
               borrowing. The Coptic word stock has a considerable Greek
             {jcomponent. The transfer of Greek lexical material was not confined to
             {content words, such as nouns, verbs and adjectives, but also mvolved a
             ‘tconsiderable amount of function words, such as sentence conjunctions,
              discourse markers, manner      and time adverbials,     and even    some
              prepositions. The variant spelling of Copto-Greek loan words not only
              reflects ongoing sound changes in the source language Koine Greek,
              but also the absence of certain phonological oppositions in the
              borrowing language Coptic Egyptian.

the matrix clause by means of a relative antecedent or pivot. The pivot

Tense                  Tense is a deictic category which §7.1, §8.1

                       time. Absolute tenses relate an event
                       with respect to a fixed temporal
                       reference    point     (the    present
                       moinent), while relative tenses relate
                       an event with respect to another
                       event.

Nominal sentences
This Unit completes our survey of the nominal domain by taking <
closer look at the Coptic equivalents of sentences like John is a
physician, where the indefinite noun phrase a physician does not refer
to any particular individual, but rather predicates something about the
subject John, namely his profession as a medical doctor. Such
sentences are called nominal sentences, since they contain a noun
phrase that is used predicatively.
   Coptic nominal sentences are peculiar in two ways. First, they are
verbless constructions in the present tense, i.e. they lack a verbal
copula corresponding to English be. Thus, one class of nominal
sentences is formed by juxtaposition of a personal pronoun and an
indefinite noun phrase in predicative function, e.g. anr oyna ‘]
(anr) (am) a ghost (oy-mNa)’ (Onnophr. 206:19). The syntax and
semantics of such bipartite nominal sentences are the topic of section
5.1. Second, there is another type of nominal sentences, which contain
an extra pronominal element besides the subject and the nominal
predicate, e.g. aNOK Ne NwHpe mmNOyTe ‘I (aNoR) (am) the son
(n-wupe) of God (u-n-NoyTe)’ (Abbatén 240:13). As will be shown
in section 5.2, the added pronoun ne in such tripartite nominal
sentences has no anaphoric role (i.e. it does not refer to previously
mentioned discourse participants), but rather fulfils a purely
grammatical function as an agreement clitic, which links the subject to
the nominal predicate.
   Nominal sentences have a relatively transparent syntax with only a
limited degree of word order variation. Yet, a broad spectrum of
                                                                                                                                       so be found

Hypothetical free relatives are semantically interpreted as the protasis
(iF-)clause of a conditional construction, with the surrounding main
clause functioning as the apodosis. Syntactically, such hypothetical
free relatives are encoded as left-dislocated topics. They are
particularly common in prescriptive and didactic contexts, often with a
promissive connotation, e.g. Nal THpoy MeTNaaMeEXrEet Epooy

Verbal morphology
Verbs and nouns are the basic building blocks for sentences. Nouns are
referring expressions that name individuals, objects or locations, while
verbs are typically used as predicates that designate relations between
entities: events they participated in or states that were obtained. The
present Unit is the first of four units on the Coptic verbal-inflectional
system. Its focus is on verbal morphology and the syntactic encoding
of nominal arguments that refer to the event’s participants. Unit 7 deals
with the morpho-syntax of verbal tense and aspect and the contrastive
behaviour of the various present, past and future tenses. This leads to
Unit 8, which is about relative tenses and moods. Unit 9 completes the
survey of the inflectional domain by examining the negative
counterparts of the various verbal tenses, aspects and moods.
  The Coptic verbal system is organized around relatively abstract
lexical representations (foots) and fully specified surface forms
(stems), which are associated with a particular morpho-semantic
pattern. Take, for instance, the pair xwT ‘to build’ and Kut ‘to be (in a)
built (state)’, both of which are derived from the biliteral root /k-t/,
meaning something like “constructing, shaping”. Section 6.1 provides
an introduction to Coptic root-and-pattern morphology.
  Derivationally related stems like kw7 and kHT contain two layers of
meaning that interact in complex ways. On the one hand, there is the
basic lexical value of the underlying verbal root. On the other hand,
there is the inherent dynamic or static meaning of the stem pattern with
which the underlying root is associated. Thus, while the verb stem kwT
‘to build’ designates the structure-building event itself, the

The previous unit was largely concerned with the aspectual underpinning
of Coptic verb derivation. The various formal classes of verbs or stem
patterns were shown to express basic aspectual oppositions, such as the
contrast between events and states. We now turn to the grammatical
expression of another basic category of verbal semantics, which is tense.
Tense is a deictic category, which grammaticalises the location of a
situation on the time axis. The concern here is with absolute tenses,
which are tense categories that take the present moment as their main
temporal reference point or deictic centre. The linear ordering of events
with respect to the present moment furnishes three absolute tenses, the
present, the past and the future, which locate the time of the event at,
prior to or after this temporal reference point.
  In Coptic, present, past and future time reference is accomplished via
morphemes in the inflectional system. Such time-indicating morphemes
often come in pairs, whose members share the same temporal value, but
differ from one another with respect to other categories of verbal
meaning, such as aspect and mood. Thus, both the Perfect marker a and
the Preterit auxiliary Ne refer to past events. But while the Perfect
indicates the past location of accomplished events, the temporal auxiliary
Ne is specifically used to describe past states. Compare: a Nepwne Ae
