                    14.5.3 The negator -ma:r- in independent clausesThe negator -ma:r- can negate a fully inﬂected predicate of an independent clause, albeit rarely,
and under marked circumstances. The fully inﬂected verb takes -ma:r- immediately after the
stem (see the structure of the inﬂected verb in §11.1.2) and remains fully inﬂected.
   The most frequent context in which a predicate of an independent clause negated with
-ma:r- may occur involves focusing a negated clause. This is shown in 14.134. That the verb is
in highlighting focus is corroborated by the presence of the nominal cross-referencing enclitics
which provide an additional overtone of ‘it is the case that’; this is reﬂected in the translation.14.134 yanu t@-ma:r-na-a:l
       magic have/be-neg.sub-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
       ‘It is the case that she did not possess the magic’  The presence of the negator may be the only indicator that the absence of the action of the
verb is in focus, as in 14.135.

   Typologically speaking, focus constructions are often expressed via cleft clauses which, in
their turn, involve marking part of a clause as dependent. That a dependent clause negator is
used in focused clauses conﬁrms that such clauses may be considered underlyingly dependent.
However, there are no other overt indicators that the clause is desubordinated.
   Desubordinated clauses containing fully inﬂected verbs are also negated with the dependent
clause negator -ma:r-. In 14.136, the elliptical answer to the question contains a desubordinated
relative clause:
14.136 ak@          s@k@r nana:u        vya-l@-l?                      ñ@n

       ya-ma:r-ñ@n
       come-neg.sub-2fem.sgbas.p
       ‘When (lit. what time) did the earthquake strike? (Time when) you had not come’
   In 14.137, what could have been phrased as a causal clause, just like 14.116 and the ﬁrst
clause of 14.55, was phrased as an independent clause negated with -ma:r- followed by the
conjunction al@k ‘this is why’ as an afterthought. This was Gemaj’s answer to an unstated
question why my sandals were getting loose.
14.137 m@y-a kamna:gw k@-ma:r-ñ@na                                   [pause] al@k

       ‘You do not eat real food, this is why’
   We will see, in §19.9, that same-subject completive forms of the verb t@- ‘be, have’ are
developing into conjunctions which introduce what are treated as dependent clauses containing
fully inﬂected verbs. That this is really the case is corroborated by the fact that such newly
developed dependent clauses are negated with the dependent negator -ma:r-, as shown in
14.138. This is a comment on why a neighbouring group does not have any traditional masks
left:
14.138 sana:k            karab@          ja:p kui-taka-dana-di

       ‘They gave away the things from men’s house for money, this is why they do not have
       (them any more)’
  Independent clauses can be negated with -ma:r- if they express wishes and regrets. Dameli-
way and myself developed a mutual liking for each other from the very ﬁrst meeting, at the end
of which she exclaimed:
14.139 oh, walba:b kwa-ma:r-na-dian
       oh near         stay-neg.sub-act.foc-1plbas.vt
       ‘Oh (it is a pity that) we do not live close!’
332      14 Negation  Similarly, an exclamation at 14.140 expresses a wish that:
14.140 wan@b yi-ma:r-na
       noise go/say-neg.sub-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘May she not make noise! (meaning I wish she did not make noise)’
  Along similar lines, 14.141 expresses a regret concerning the ﬁshing grounds spoilt forever.
14.141 aw k@ta k@                    kamap-ma:r-da                                      k@ta

       ‘Now this (a variety of ﬁsh) does not appear, now we regretfully do not see this! Before
       this lake was not like that’
  An independent clause negated with -ma:r- may also have an irrealis meaning if it occurs
with future marking; this is always mixed with a wish for the thing not to happen:
14.142 [gu    k@-ku]       kiya-k-na-wun                  [wun-a-d@     naka-d@-m@y-a

       child see-neg.sub-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘Having drowned (lit. eaten water), I will die, oh dear I might not see my only son’
If such a negated form follows a command, it may have an apprehensive meaning ‘or else’:
14.143 k@-di        plet ajan           a                 kamna:gw
       dem.prox-pl plate impv+wash dem.dist+fem.sg food
       k@-ma:r@-k@-na-ñ@n
       eat-neg.sub-fut-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Wash these plates, or else you may not get the food’
   The ways in which independent negative clauses marked with -ma:r- are used to express
meanings covering wishes, regrets, negative irrealis, and undesirable consequences can be
ultimately traced back to the negative focused clauses (as illustrated in 14.134–5): all of these
involve focusing on the non-activity.
   The marker -ma:r- appears to be cognate to the negative imperative -mar-ék in Wosera
(Wilson 1980: 164–5). The use of the morpheme -ma:r- to express wishes is a link between
otherwise hardly comparable meanings of Manambu -ma:r- and Wosera -marék.
      14.6 i n h e r e n t ly ne gat i v e l e x e m e s a n d n e gat i v e p ro-c laus e sManambu has a number of inherently negative forms. These cannot be negated, and occur in
a negative context only.
   The adverb s@m@rab, s@ma:b, sama:b or s@ms@ma:b ‘never ever’ is typically used in negated
clauses as an emphatic negator. It occurs both in declarative clauses which already have the
negator ma: as in 14.144 and T3.43, or ak@s, as in 14.50, and in commands, as in 14.95 and
14.145. The four forms appear fully synonymous.
                                                         14.6 Inherently negative lexemes      33314.144 wun ma: la:kw        s@ms@ma:b

       never.ever 3du-obl-com say-ep-proh.extra
       ‘Do not ever talk to them two!’
  Just occasionally, this adverb can be used as the only negative word in a clause, making the
whole clause negative, as in 14.146 (with the predicate in desiderative mood), and in 14.147.

  A development of an emphatic form in a negative construction into a negation marker is
typologically well attested. In Manambu, there is no doubt that this is an innovation. Whether
the root sam- is etymologically linked to the quantiﬁer samasa:m ‘many’ (§10.5) is an open
question.
  A number of inherently negative forms are used as pro-clauses, that is, as negative responses.
An inherently negative adverb kapi sapi ‘no way’ is used as a negative response and a negative
pro-clause. This could well be an alliterative compound based on the root kapi cognate to the
negator kupu(k) found in numerous Ndu languages. Its variants are sapi kapi or just kapi. I
was told that sapi can also be used this way, but never found an example.
  A proximate demonstrative k@ in highlighting focus (ka, kal (dem.prox+3fem.sgnom) or kad
(dem.prox+3masc.sgnom) ) can be used as an emphatic negator, as in 10.24, 18.26, 14.41, and
14.148:
14.148 vyau           wa-l@-k                 ka!
       hit+1sgimpv say-3fem.sg-compl.ss dem.prox+3fem.sgnom
       ‘ “Can I hit (it)?”, said (the younger sister), “No!” (said the elder sister)’
  This looks like a demonstrative—however, we cannot rule out that this form is in fact a
remnant of a Proto-Ndu negator with the velar ﬁrst syllable, ultimately cognate with kapi.
  The negator most frequently used as a negative pro-clause is ma: ‘no’. It is used as a negative
reaction to a command, as in 14.42, or just to contradict a statement, as in 14.86. It is also used
as a negative response to positive questions, as in 14.149, where it is often accompanied by a
negated verb:
14.149 s@r         ya-k-na-d?                      ma:, yæy  ma:
       tomorrow come-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt No, come.neg neg
       ‘ “Will he come tomorrow?” “No, he won’t come” ’
  To provide a conﬁrmation to a negative question, ayey ‘yes’ is used, as in 14.150 (also see
§4.5.5 and 4.83). This can optionally be accompanied by a negated verb:
334     14 Negation14.150 ñ@n      ga:n s@        kwa-ma:r-ñ@na?                                  ayey
       you.fem night sleep stay-neg.sub-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt Yes
       ‘ “You didn’t sleep (last) night, did you?” “No, I didn’t (lit. yes)” ’
   To refute a negative suggestion, ma: ‘general negator’ or ak@s ‘habitual negator’ is used, as
in 14.151 and 14.51.
14.151 ñ@n      ma: ya:g? ma:! samasa:m yaga-lwun                wun

       ‘ “You were not scared (of a plane crash)?” “No, I was scared a lot” ’
  The desiderative negator ata is not used this way. The negator ma: is often used to negate
a clause as a whole. It is then postposed to the clause and preceded by a short pause, as in
14.66–8 and 14.152–4.
14.152 [ [wun yi-ku]       [v@-tua                       ja:p] v@-tua]

       ‘Having gone I looked at the thing I saw (before)—nothing!’
14.153 m@yir laku-n      [pause] ma:
       really know-seq [pause] neg
       ‘They do not really know’ (lit. really knowing—no)’
  An interjection may precede the negator, showing that it constitutes a separate clause:
14.154 [æya vyak@t-a sa:d-ad]                       [pause] a      ma:
       always good-lk fashion-3masc.sg.nom [pause] conn neg
       ‘It was not always good way of life’ (lit. it is always good way—this was not the case)
  The negator ma: is often used elliptically in any clause type, as in 14.155–6. The habitual
negator ak@s but not the desiderative negator ata can also be used this way—see 14.50 and
14.157.
14.155 [ah, ya:     ma:], [ñ@n   ma:] [adakw] [ñanugw m@wi

                                                       14.6 Inherently negative lexemes      335   We saw in §14.1.3 that if a constituent is to be negated separately, it has to form a negative
clause with the negator ma:; see 14.41. The general negator ma: can occur as a complement of
the verb wa- ‘say’, in the meaning of ‘refuse, say no’, as shown in 9.5, 13.78, and 14.42.
Like most languages of the world, Manambu has numerous other expressions with negative
meanings, such as wa-t@p- (say-be.closed) ‘forbid’ and wuk@-t@p- (hear/think-close) ‘forget’.
However, such terms are not inherently negative because they can be negated just like any
other verb (see §15.3, on their structure).
  A recently introduced inherently negative term tabu ‘taboo, forbidden’, from Tok Pisin, is
often used by those speakers who tend to code-switch. It tends to be accompanied by a negative
command in Manambu, as in 14.158 (partly repeated from 14.74).
14.158 [tabu] [war-tukwa]
       taboo go.up-proh.gen
       ‘It is forbidden, don’t go up’
The dependent clause negator -ma:r appears to participate in the formation of two verbs,
wuk@-mar- ‘forget’ (lit. remember/think-neg.sub) and ya:p s@-mar- (breath plant-neg.sub) ‘be
dead’. Both verbs can be negated, and thus are not inherently negative. There is evidence,
however, that -mar- in ‘forget’ and the negator -ma:r- may be lookalikes and not cognates.
First, the component -mar- in the verb ‘forget’ does not have a long vowel. Secondly, as we
saw in 12.71 (§12.8.2), this component undergoes partial reduplication quite diﬀerent from the
reduplication of the negator -ma:r-. Another example of such partial reduplication meaning
‘fully’ is at 14.159:
14.159 k@k@t@p kui-ku,                   d@-k@-m     atawa sa:d
       K@k@t@p give.to.third.p-compl.ss he-obl-loc thus way

       ‘Having given (him) the K@k@t@p feast (mortuary feast), this way we have forgotten all
       about him’
  We saw in §14.5.1 that the negator -ma:r- can undergo reduplication of a diﬀerent sort: an
example of the reduplicated negator used to negate ‘in case’ conditional clauses is at 14.126. A
similar example is at 14.160, where the verb wuk@- ‘hear, listen, think’ is negated this way. The
form wuk@-marmar-@k can mean ‘unless/lest I forget’, or ‘for me not to forget’.
14.160 suku              (k@pa:b) wuk@-marmar-@k
       write+1sg.impv in.case think-neg.sub.red-dat
       ‘Let me write it down lest I might not think (of it)’
  That the negator -ma:r- and the component -mar- in what look like verbs with negative
meanings are reduplicated diﬀerently shows that, at least synchronically, they are diﬀerent
forms.
  Despite the wealth of negative constructions in Manambu, additional negative strategies
may be employed. As shown in 14.73, questions are often used in negative meanings. In 14.161,
a question implies a negative command: the girl was not supposed to drink too much water
because there was no place for her to go to the toilet:
14.161 toilet yi-k-ñ@na                                 tami: ak@m-a?

       ‘Did we cook for you, eh?’ (meaning: we did not cook for you)
   These negative strategies conﬁrm the connection between questions and negation in Man-
ambu, corroborating an etymological link between the negative and the interrogative ata
(§14.3).
                                         14.7 s ummaryManambu has a complex system of expressing negation. Only predicates can be negated; and if
a non-predicate constituent has to be negated, this is achieved by making it into an independent
predicate head. A limited variability of the scope of negation is found with the general negator
ma: in non-future declarative clauses only. A summary is in Tables 14.2–3.
   Numerous categories are neutralized under negation. These include the following.
(i) Dependent clause types: in positive polarity Manambu has seven types of medial depen-
dent clauses (see §18.1), juxtaposed dependent clauses, and relative clauses; of these, one
(‘unlikely condition’) cannot be negated, and all the rest except for one (the ‘in case’ conditional
clause) are negated in the same way, with the dependent negator -ma:r-.","[357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363]"
"
                           14.5.1 Negating dependent clausesA verbal predicate of a dependent clause of any of the types described in Chapters 18–19 is
negated with the suﬃx -ma:r-. There are two exceptions: a repetitive clause marked with the
suﬃx -k@k@b is never negated; the corresponding meaning is partly conveyed by using habitual
negative in a juxtaposed clause, as in 14.124. An irrealis conditional clause marked with -ga:y
is never negated, and has no simple negative counterpart (see §18.8).
   A manner sequential clause whose predicate is marked with the suﬃx -@n is illustrated at
14.109. We will see, in §18.1, that -(@)n-marked clauses have a wide range of meanings, covering
time (‘while’), as in 14.109, and reason (‘as, because’), as in 14.110. The resulting form is
uninﬂected. An -n clause can either precede or follow the main clause.

   A complex predicate consisting of a verb marked with -@n and an auxiliary t@- (see §17.1.1)
can be negated in two ways, with diﬀerent meanings. If the auxiliary is negated, as in 14.32–3,
this implies anterior reading—implying that something has or has not happened in the past
and this is relevant for the moment of speech. Alternatively, the -@n form of the verb can be
negated, e.g. s@kul@k yarakara yi-y@ laku-mar-@n ta:l (cooking well go-red know-neg:sub-seq
stay+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘She did not know how to cook properly’. The implication is that of a
complete lack of experience whose general relevance goes beyond the moment of speech.
   A desubordinated manner sequential clause occurs in questions (in 14.132)—we return to
this in §14.5.3.
   A negated same-subject completive clause is illustrated in 14.111. A desubordinated same-
subject completive clause can be used in a question (at 14.133)—see §14.5.3.

   We will see in Chapter 19 that Manambu employs ‘tail-head’, or bridging, linkage as a
device for maintaining discourse coherence. This involves repeating the last verb in a main
clause within a dependent completive clause of the following sentence. If the repeated verb
is negative, it takes the dependent negator when used in a dependent clause. An example of
tail-head linkage involving negation is at 14.113.

in a main clause—see 14.70–1. We can recall, from §9.2, that a clause can take the suﬃx -p@k
‘like’; when negated, the verb takes the subordinate negator -ma:r- which conﬁrms the status
of such clauses as dependent, as in 14.117.

   Relative clauses share all the categories with positive main clauses; in fact a positive relative
clause can only be distinguished from a main clause by the lack of intonation break between
the clause and the common argument. Examples of relative clauses—whose predicates are fully
inﬂected verbs—are in curly brackets in 14.113. There are no restrictions on the function of a
common argument in either the main or the relative clause. The only type of relative clause
whose surface realization diﬀers from a main clause involves relativization of the possessor—
see the full discussion in §19.2.
   Relative clauses reveal their true nature when they are negated: they require the negator
-ma:r-, just like any dependent clause. As expected, the action focus does not occur in negative
relative clauses, but the habitual -kwa- does. A positive relative clause is given at 14.118a and its
negative equivalent at 14.118b. Further examples of negated relative clauses are at 14.119–21,
and 19.23a–b.

  Any relative clause can be used headlessly, and it is negated in the same way. In 14.122, a
headless relative clause is used in A function:
328      14 Negation14.122 yawi kur-ma:r-dana-di                 luku moa yet kur-kwa-dana-di

       ‘Those who do not work steal even more’
  Juxtaposed clauses which express condition of diﬀerent kinds (see Chapters 18 and 19)
are another dependent clause type which is segmentally indistinguishable from main clauses
unless negated. (Even if not negated, they have a particular intonation contour which indicates
their dependency—see Chapter 19.) When negated, they require the dependent negator -ma:r-
and thus behave just as dependent clauses are expected to. An example is 14.123—a positive
juxtaposed clause is contrasted to a negative one. The man is telling his wife what to expect of
his trip. Juxtaposed clauses are in curly brackets, and a relative clause is in square brackets.

       which I follow (lit. which I go) is not real, then I won’t come back’
   The distinction between negative future and negative irrealis is neutralized in dependent
clauses: the marking -ma:r-k@- (neg.sub-fut/irr) is used for both. As we saw in 14.56–8,
whether the condition is counterfactual or not can only be decided in the context of a whole
sentence, and by the form of the verb in a main clause.
   As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the habitual or repetitive negative meaning in
a dependent clause can be expressed with a negative habitual juxtaposed clause—see 14.124.
In positive polarity, a dependent clause would have been likely to be marked with the suﬃx
-k@b/k@k@b ‘as soon as’ (see §18.6).
14.124 {jan-ma:r-kwa-tua}                               samasa:m t@-k-na-di
       wash-neg.sub-hab-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt many              be-fut-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘If I do not keep washing (dishes) there will be many (dirty ones)’
  That is, any dependent clause is likely to be negated with -ma:r-. Conﬁrmation of this
principle comes from spontaneously introduced innovations, which arise through adopting
code-switches in Tok Pisin to the Manambu system. Consider 14.125. Manambu does not
have a one-word equivalent to the Tok Pisin nogut ‘it is no good that, lest’, and the clausal
complement of this nonce code-switch was reinterpreted as a dependent clause—which can be
seen from the way ‘(that) you will not see’ is negated.
14.125 nogut      [v@-ma:r-k-ñ@na                           Kabla:m]
       no.good see-neg.sub-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt Screw.River+lk+acc
       ‘It is no good that you won’t see the Screw River’
   There is just one exception. As mentioned in §13.7, the predicate of the dependent condi-
tional clause introduced by the adverb k@pa:b ‘in case’ is negated with -ma:r-, just as expected.
However, the negator is reduplicated: we can recall that in 13.88 and other positive counterparts
of examples like 14.126 the verbal root, and not any other morpheme, is reduplicated. The
verbal root occurs in its negative form ra:p (the positive form is r@p ‘be enough, ﬁt’) (but note
                                                   14.5 Negation of dependent clauses      329that in 14.160 and 18.52 positive forms of the verbal root are used in similar constructions).
When reduplicated, the negator loses its long vowel.

       put-up+seq impv+see in.case ﬁt.neg-neg.sub:red-dat
       ‘Try it on, in case it is not good’
  A similar example is at 14.160 below. That is, judging by the way in which they are negated,
the ‘in case’ clauses stand apart from dependent clauses of all other types.","[352, 353, 354, 355, 356]"
"                        14.1.2 Negation of non-verbal predicatesNon-verbal predicates do not distinguish tenses or aspects characteristic of verbs. To negate a
non-verbal predicate, the negator ma: is postposed to the non-verb stripped of nominal cross-
referencing markers. Person, gender, and number distinctions are neutralized under negation—
just as in negative forms of verbal predicates. A negated non-verbal predicate does not distin-
guish tense (just like its positive counterpart). And the negator can only occur postposed to the
predicate head—this is unlike verbal negative structures where the position of the negator (and
the form of the verb) distinguish non-future and future constructions. That is, postposition
of the negator to the negated predicate has diﬀerent meanings depending on whether we are
dealing with a verb or with a non-verbal predicate head. Scheme 14.2 shows how all person,
number, and gender distinctions are neutralized once a non-verbal predicate is negated.
   Consider 14.7. In the negative structure, the head of predicate ‘man’ does not take any
nominal cross-referencing markers, while in the positive structure it takes the nominal cross-
referencing for third person singular masculine. The positive and the negative forms are
underlined. Both the negative and the positive non-verbal predicates are tense neutral. Similar
examples are at 10.2, 10.16, and 10.31.14.7 [a-d             k@-d@            t@p-a-k@-d@             du ma:]

     ‘That is (was, will be) not a man from this village; that is a man who had grown up across
     there, on the mountain called Turu, and had come across’
  The same negative structure is used for negating existence of something, as in 14.8 and 10.58,
or lack of possession, as in 8.20, 10.6, and 14.9.
14.8 n@k@           s@    ma:
     other+fem.sg name neg
     ‘There is no other name (for this bird)’14.9 b@r      yawi-kur-tami: ma:
     you.two work-do-area neg
     ‘You have no area to do work’
   An alternative to a non-verbal negative possessive structure is a negative version of a clause
containing a positional verb kwa- ‘stay’, as in 7.8 (‘there are no women like this (in) this village’)
and 7.30 (‘I have no betelnut’). The implication is of negating ‘living’, or ‘staying’, or ‘being on
someone’—that is, implying a temporary lack of possession. This is in contrast to structures
like the one in 14.9 which imply permanent lack of possession, or of existence.
Negative attributive verbless clauses have the same structure, as in 13.87, 14.7, and 14.10–12.

      ‘This is not your lake, this is not your sago ﬁeld’
   We can recall, from §11.2, that when agreeing adjectives (‘small’ or ‘big’) or any other
agreeing modiﬁers from closed classes occur in the predicate slot, they mark agreement with
the subject. In positive clauses, this results in what can be seen as redundant double agreement
in gender with the same constituent. In negative clauses the verbal cross-referencing is omitted
so that only one agreement marker remains—see 14.11–12 (an example of a positive clause
with ‘double’ agreement is at 11.7).

      ‘You (man) are not small, you are big’
   In 14.13, a reduplicated adjective s@mi ‘far’ heads the negative attributive clause. The redu-
plicated form has the same meaning in a positive and in a negative clause. This is unlike
reduplicated verbs—we will see in §14.3.3 that negating a reduplicated verb root results in a
modal meaning.
14.13 k@                  t@p     s@mi-s@mi ma:
      dem.prox.fem.sg village far-far       neg
      ‘This village is not very far’
302      14 NegationAll non-verbal predicates are negated in the same way, no matter whether they take nominal
cross-referencing or not in positive polarity. The predicate marker is obligatory with manner
demonstratives—which do not take nominal cross-referencing—when they appear in the pred-
icate slot of a positive clause (see §10.2.2); it is omitted from negative clauses:
14.14 ak@tawa ma:
      like.this neg
      ‘It is not like this’
Diﬀerent types of verbless clauses with non-verbal forms as predicate heads are neutralized
under negation (see §20.1.3 on clause types). This agrees with the spirit of dependencies
between grammatical systems: we expect fewer distinctions in negative clauses than in cor-
responding positive clauses.
  The variant ma:n of the general negator appears to be required under one condition: if a
negated clause with a non-verbal predicate is in highlighting focus and the predicate takes
nominal cross-referencing. (It is possible that ma:n is morphologically complex and consists of
ma: followed by the predicative marker -n.) This is illustrated with 14.15, from a story about a
grandmother desperately looking for her grandchildren who were nowhere to be found.
14.15 [k@-l@-m                  ma:n-a]           [k@-l@-m          ma:n-a]
      dem.prox-fem.sg-loc neg-3fem.sgnom dem.prox-fem.sg-loc neg-3fem.sgnom
      ‘It is the case that they were not here, they were not there’
  This construction has only occurred in one traditional story. I recorded it three times, with
diﬀerent speakers. Each stretch in square brackets in 14.15 was pronounced as one word, and
repeated twice with a ﬁxed singing intonation. I suspect that focusing clauses with non-verbal
negative predicates is not a productive process, and that 14.15 is a one-oﬀ, archaic structure.
We will see, in §14.5, that focus structures in negative clauses with verbal predicates involve
dependent negation.
  Tense, or aspect, can be expressed in a negative clause headed by a non-verb. The non-verbal
form has to be used as the complement of the copula t@- ‘be’ (this form retains its root form t@
when negated). In 14.16, the speaker says that she was not a big girl when the Second World
War came. The non-verbal component, ‘big girl’, is a copula complement of t@- which forms a
non-future negative construction:14.16 [wun a                   ñ@          numa      ñan ma: t@],   [war
      I      dem.dist.fem.sg time/sun big.fem.sg child neg be.neg war
      ya-d@-l]
      come-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘At that time I was not a big girl, (time when) the war came’
  In 14.17, a negated copula clause with the adjective kuprap ‘bad’ as the copula complement
forms a future negative construction:
14.17 kamna:gw kuprap t@         ma:
      food       bad      be.neg neg
      ‘Food won’t be (or become) bad’
  A similar example is in T3.43. Copula constructions with the copula t@- and an adjective
as copula complements are ambiguous: they may mean either ‘be adjective’ or ‘become
adjective’; this ambiguity is resolved only through context. For instance, while in 14.17 either
                                                 14.1 Declarative non-habitual clauses     303reading is acceptable, in 14.18 only the ‘be’ reading makes sense: the speaker was trying to

   To be used in a negative dependent clause, a non-verbal predicate has to be transformed into
a copula complement of the same copula t@-, which is marked with a dependent clause negator,
as shown in 14.19. We return to the negation of dependent clauses in §14.5.

  We will see, in §14.1.3, that there is a certain amount of freedom in word order within non-
future negative constructions, including those involving copulas.","[327, 328, 329, 330]"

polarity operates in the language.
(ii) Person, number, and gender are neutralized in declarative non-habitual negative clauses.
   Negation is instrumental in providing a distinction between relative clauses, juxtaposed
clauses, and main clauses. In positive polarity, these types are distinguished by intonation only.
   Negation distinguishes future from irrealis forms. The existing link between questions
(conceived as underlyingly dependent structures) and dependent clauses surfaces only under
negation.
   Three prohibitives diﬀer in their strength, and in a number of morphosyntactic properties
(see Table 14.1). These correspond to just one positive imperative, and a variety of imperative
strategies.
   The negation of desiderative involves a marker which is possibly of an interrogative origin.
This may have its basis in a tendency to use questions in lieu of negative structures throughout
the language.
        15        Verb Compounding
                                    15.1 a n ov e rv i ewManambu has a wide variety of compound verbs which can consist of two or three roots. Their
meanings include cause-eﬀect, sequence of sub-events, and aktionsart. One or two components
can undergo full reduplication (see §12.8.2). Verb compounds form one grammatical and one
phonological word. Their components are strictly contiguous: no other element can intervene
between them.
   The components cannot have separate value of tense, aspect, mood, action focus, modality,
or polarity. A compound is marked just once for each of the appropriate categories. All
compounds have fused argument structure: that is, they share all the core and peripheral
arguments. Two identical verbs cannot occur in one compound.
   Compounds account for about 20 per cent of verbs in texts and conversations. The pro-
ductivity of compounds varies, depending on their type. Components of a compound always
occur in a ﬁxed order. The only exception in the corpus is the pair taka-t@p- (put-close) ‘prevent
(from seeing), block’ and t@p@-taka- (close-put) ‘cover (the surface of something); prevent from
seeing’: these only partly overlap in their meanings (see §15.3 (A7 and A8) ).
   All these properties are typical of one-word serial verb constructions, of a kind similar to
those found in other languages of the Sepik area (e.g. Yimas and Alamblak), and elsewhere
(e.g. Olutec in Central America and Dâw in Amazonia: a comprehensive typological account
is in Aikhenvald 2006a). What sets the Manambu verb compounds apart from canonical one-
word serial verbs is their composition, and their semantics.
   A number of components in verb compounds provide manner, aspect, and other speciﬁ-
cations to the major component, but are not used in the language on their own (e.g. -jika-
‘do properly’, -maki- in gra- ‘cry’, gra-maki- (cry-do.a.lot) ‘cry a lot’). These nonce roots are
treated as verb roots rather than as derivational suﬃxes only for the sake of a uniﬁed analysis of
verb compounding structures. When more information on the lexicon of other Ndu languages
becomes available, we may be able to conﬁrm, or refute, our assumptions about their verbal
origins.
   The semantic link between the independent verb and the same form in a compound is often
obscure. For instance, the verb yak@- means ‘throw’, and the compounded root -yak@- means
‘do fully’—the formal match is perfect, but the semantic link is not. The verb ya- means
‘come’. The form -ya- in compounds has two meanings. One, ‘coming; (do) while coming’,
is transparently related to the verb ‘come’, and the other, ‘carry on doing’, is not. We are faced
with the problem of diﬀerentiating polysemous stems from homonyms—a pervasive puzzle
throughout Manambu.
   All these features are atypical for serial verbs (see an exhaustive account in Aikhenvald
2006a). The meanings of many compounds are idiomatic and do not follow any straight-
forward semantic rules. Even those compounds which can be considered productive display
restrictions on one or both components. Some verbs hardly ever occur in compounds. One
verb, ‘see’, has a suppletive form when it occurs as second component in compounding. This
                                                          15.2 Symmetrical compounds          339feature is reminiscent of ‘combining forms’ described in derivational morphology (Aikhenvald
2007), and is atypical of serial verbs. This is why I prefer to analyse Manambu verb sequences
as lexicalized compounds rather than as bona ﬁde serial verbs.
  In terms of their composition, Manambu compounds divide into symmetrical and asym-
metrical (cross-linguistically, this distinction is encountered in serial verbs, and other multi-
verb constructions: see Aikhenvald 2006a; Amha and Dimmendaal 2006).
   (i) Symmetrical compounds consist of two components, from large open classes, whose
       semantic relationship is that of sequence of sub-actions, manner, or cause-eﬀect. Each
       has restrictions on the nature and/or the transitivity of one of the components. See §15.2.
  (ii) Asymmetrical compounds consist of a verb from a largish open class (‘major’ verb)
       followed by a root from a closed class (‘minor’ verb) which provides a meaning to do
       with aspect, aktionsart, extent of action, and valency increase, as in k@-kus@- (eat-ﬁnish)
       ‘ﬁnish eating, eat up’, k@-k@ta- (eat-try) ‘try eating’. See §15.3.
  An alternative structure, whereby a ‘minor’ verb from a closed class precedes the ‘major’
verb, is restricted to two ‘minor’ verbs—wa- ‘say’ and yi- ‘go’. Given the restrictions on these
constructions, we cannot exclude the option of their alternative analysis as preﬁxes.
  Asymmetrical compounds whose second component is the verb -yi- ‘go’ or -ya- ‘come’ which
provides aspectual speciﬁcation do not occur in the imperative. To be used in a command, they
have to be rephrased with a biclausal structure.
Verb compounds may consist of a symmetrical compound within an asymmetrical one; or of
two asymmetrical compounds. They can never contain more than three verb roots. See §15.4.
The eﬀects of verb root reduplication in compounds are summarized in §15.5 (also see §12.8.2).
  Some directionals can be analysed as a subtype of verb compounds—see §16.1.
  Verb compounds diﬀer from complex predicates consisting of an uninﬂected form of the
major verb and an inﬂectable auxiliary. Unlike compounds, complex predicates form one
grammatical construction (with one tense, aspect, modality and polarity value), but consist
of two grammatical and phonological words—this is the topic of Chapter 17.
                           15.2 s ymmetrical comp oundsSymmetrical compounds belong to three broad types: sequencing (§15.2.1), manner (§15.2.2),
and cause-eﬀect (§15.2.3). Semantically non-compositional idiomatic compounds, including
those with nonce roots, are discussed in §15.2.4.","[363, 364, 365, 366]"
"
            14.3.2 Negation of same-subject purposive and of desiderativeThe same-subject purposive in main clauses and the desiderative are negated with the particle
ata which obligatorily precedes the modal form, and forms an independent phonological and
grammatical word. The negator ata is not used on its own as a pro-clause or a negative
response. The constituent order is ﬁxed: the negator always precedes the verb.
  Examples of the negative desiderative are 14.61–2, and the ﬁrst line of 14.65. The negative
desiderative is an uninﬂected verb (just like the positive desiderative), so person, number, and
gender of the subject are not expressed on the verb. If necessary for disambiguation, a personal
pronoun can be supplied, as in 14.61.
14.61 wun day-a-wa        ata       k@-k@r
      I     they-lk-com neg.des eat-des
      ‘I do not want to eat with them’
  Example 14.62 is ambiguous: it is a suggestion to a second person, and at the same time a
generic statement:
14.62 ñam          yawi kur-tukwa           s@p kuprap ata          t@-k@r
      sun+lk+loc work do/get-proh.gen skin bad            neg.des become-des
      ‘Do not work in the sun, you don’t want your skin to get bad’
  The same negator is used with the same-subject purposive in main clauses:
14.63 ñ@n      ata      væk@r-@k
      you.fem neg.des fall-purp.ss
      ‘You are not going to fall down’
  The negator ata does not have to be contiguous with the desiderative or the purposive. A
part of a complex predicate, as in 14.64–5, or a copula complement, as in 7.75, can intervene
between the negator and the verb, if focused. This is similar to the behaviour of the negators
ma: ‘general non-habitual negator’ and ak@s ‘habitual negator’.
14.64 wun ata        s@     kwa-k@r
      I     neg.des sleep stay-des
      ‘I don’t want to sleep’
                                             14.3 Negation of non-indicative modalities      313  Example 14.65, from the same story as 14.35 above, contains a complex predicate:
14.65 [ [ [an skul    ata     r@-k@r] [an      ata        j@b@ kur-@k] ]         wa-ku]
      we.two school neg.des sit-des we.two neg.des image do/get-purp.ss say-compl.ss
      abra                    tabu-na-b@r
      dem.dist.react.top+du run.away-act.foc-3dubas.vt
      ‘Having said, “We do not want to study (lit. sit school), we do not want to learn (lit. get
      image)”, the two ran away (from school)’
   Neither the negative desiderative nor the negative same-subject purposive occur in non-
main clauses. Neither can be negated if used other than as main clause predicates—a diﬀerent
structure has to be used instead.
   For instance, neither of the complex predicates involving the auxiliary kur- ‘do/get’ (illus-
trated in 13.62 and §17.1.2) can be negated using ata. The predicates are negated using ma:
‘general non-habitual negator’ as a separate pro-clause, as illustrated in 14.66–7. There is an
intonation break and a short pause before ma: which is indicative of a clause boundary.
14.66 kamna:gw k@-k@r kur-d@-l                               k@-k@r
      food        eat-des do/get-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p eat-des
      kur-d@-l                            [pause] ma:
      do/get-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p [pause] neg
      ‘He was about to eat food, was about to eat—nothing’ (meaning: he could not get
      himself to eat)
14.67 kaja-k       kur-d@-l                           [pause] ma:
      open-purp.ss do/get-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p [pause] neg
      ‘He was about to open (the basket)—nothing’ (meaning: he could not open it)
  The negative pro-clause negates the whole clause—that is, the desiderative or the same-
subject purposive component of the complex predicate cannot be negated separately.
  Same-subject purposive in non-main clauses cannot be negated either. The only way of
expressing negative same-subject purpose is by using the general non-habitual negator ma:
as a separate pro-clause.
14.68 [an-a:k      vya:k]     (war-na-d)                [pause] ma:
      1du-lk+dat hit+purp.ss say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt [pause] neg
      ‘He came up to hit us—no’
   A same-subject purposive used in a main clause can be negated with a pro-clause ma:
following the verb form, in an admonitive sense, as in 14.69 where a mother berates her
daughter for not looking after others.
14.69 kur-takak        ma:!
      do-put+purp.ss neg
      ‘You are not going to look after others (you ought to)’
  Just as in 14.67–8, the whole clause is within the scope of ma:. There is no other straight-
forward way of negating the same-subject purposive without negating the whole clause. To
achieve this eﬀect, the clause has to be rephrased.
  In contrast, the diﬀerent-subject purposive can be negated, using the dependent clause
negator -ma:r-, in both main and non-main clauses. We can recall, from §13.4.2, that diﬀerent-
subject purposive in a main clause implies that something is to be done following the speaker’s
order. The same holds for the negative diﬀerent-subject purposive, as shown in 14.70.
314       14 Negation14.70 m@n        laku-ma:r-m@n-k@k@k
      you.masc know-neg:sub-2masc.sg-purp.ds
      ‘I don’t want you to know’ (lit. You are not to know on speaker’s order)
  An example of a diﬀerent-subject purposive in a non-main clause is at 14.71.
14.71 [m@n        laku-ma:r-m@n-k@k]                 m@n-a:k wa:      ma:
      you.masc know-neg:sub-2masc.sg-purp.ds you.masc-lk+dat tell.neg neg
      ‘I will not tell you so that you shouldn’t know’
It is possible that the negator ata used to be able to occur with diﬀerent-subject purposive.
Such examples appear in Harrison’s (1983) collection of archaic songs about foiled marriages,
e.g. ata can also be used, apparently, without an implication of another participant (song 8,
p. 48): 1
14.72 gra-k@-tua-di                  ata       wuk@-ñ@n-k@k
      cry-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt neg.des hear-2fem.sg-purp.ds
      ‘I will cry about these, you won’t hear’
The negator ata is homophonous with the interrogative ata ‘how’ (§10.4) and the manner
demonstrative ata ‘thus, then’ (§10.2.2). We saw in §10.4 that the manner demonstrative and
the manner interrogatives are likely to be related. But is the negator ata related to these, and if
we assume that it is, how can a negative and a manner/interrogative meaning be connected to
each other?
   On the surface, the negative meaning and usage of ata appear to be pretty independent from
the interrogative and manner use of the same form, and its derivatives, such as atawa ‘thus’,
ata ata, at@ta ‘how’. However, a certain amount of evidence in favour of a link between these
lies in the ways in which interrogative clauses are used with a negative meaning. Examples are
10.104 (ma:j at@ta wuk@-k (talk how hear-purp.ss) ‘How (am I to) hear the story (if children
are screaming)’ meaning ‘I am not going to hear the story’), and 14.73:
14.73 [ [wan@b yi-da:-k]       s@      kwa-kw@ ma:] [s@     kwa-k@r ata ata]
      noise    go-3pl-compl.ds sleep lie-red neg sleep lie-des how how
      ‘When they make noise, there is no sleeping, how am I going to sleep’ (meaning: I am
      not going to sleep)
We will see in §14.6 below that questions are often used in lieu of negative statements and
commands. We can hypothesize that ata developed a meaning of negative intention out of its
interrogative use. No Ndu language appears to have an interrogative or a negator of this shape,
or function.","[339, 340, 341]"

        PrefaceThis is a grammar of Manambu, a language of the Ndu family, which is, in terms of numbers of
speakers, the largest language family of the Sepik area of New Guinea. Manambu is spoken by
about 2,500 people in ﬁve villages—three of which, Avatip, Malu, and Yambon, are suﬃciently
big to appear on most maps of Papua New Guinea. I started studying the language in 1995,
as part of my work on classiﬁers, genders, and noun classes. I was interested in learning a
language with shape-based genders. Alan Rumsey was teaching a ﬁeld methods course at
the ANU, with Pauline Agnes Luma Laki as a consultant. I came along to the course, and
then carried on working with Pauline for more than ten years afterwards—this is how my
voyage of discovery started. I have since worked with several dozen speakers of Manambu,
mostly in Avatip. Pauline Agnes Luma Laki and myself are currently engaged in preparing a
comprehensive dictionary of the language.
   This grammar contains an analysis of the Manambu language, starting from a brief charac-
terization of the language and its speakers, then going on to phonology, morphology, syntax,
discourse organization, and semantics. The analysis is cast in terms of a cumulative typological
framework of linguistic analysis—which employs ‘the fundamental theoretical concepts that
underlie all work in language description and change’ (Dixon 1997: 128) and in terms of which
signiﬁcant typological generalizations are postulated; this has come to be called ‘basic linguistic
theory’. I have avoided employing any transient formalisms. This grammar is part of genuine
documentation of the Manambu language in its varied facets.
   Every chapter of the grammar includes a presentation of the facts of the language interwoven
with arguments for their analysis within a typological framework. No attempt has been made
to separate pure ‘description’ from theoretical interpretation—which would not be a productive
task. A typological perspective for each phenomenon is crucial for the analysis given here.
   Detailed exempliﬁcation is provided for every grammatical point. Most examples come
from texts, and a few from spontaneous—or carefully directed—conversation. An additional
objective was to convey as much of the Manambu culture as possible through using naturally
occurring examples. I avoid using elicited sentences; elicitation was limited to lexicon and to
paradigms.
   English glosses are kept as close as possible to the glosses and explanations oﬀered by
my consultants. Readers should be warned against trying to draw conclusions concerning
Manambu grammar and semantics from study of the translations.
   Examples, tables, diagrams, ﬁgures, charts, and footnotes are numbered separately within
each chapter. Footnotes are also numbered separately for each chapter. The orthography used
in the examples from languages other than Manambu, and language names, follows that of the
sources (unless indicated otherwise).
   This grammar can be used as a sourcebook for further typological studies, and as a model
for further grammars of languages of the Ndu and of other families of the New Guinea area.
It is far from being the last word on Manambu—the grammar is intended to provide a sound
systematic foundation for further studies, reanalyses, and reinterpretations.
   It is my hope that this book will encourage linguists to go out into the ﬁeld and document
languages threatened by extinction (before it is too late to do so). Nothing can compare with
the intellectual excitement of working out the grammatical system of a previously undescribed
language.
        AcknowledgementsI never planned to work on a Papuan language—until I decided I needed to know more about
shape-based genders for my work on classiﬁers, genders, and noun classes. I am grateful to
Alan Rumsey for introducing me to Pauline Agnes Luma Laki in 1995. Pauline adopted me as
her younger sister, and has since been my closest collaborator. My warmest thanks go to her.
   This grammar would not have been written without the self-sacriﬁcing help, and wonderful
linguistic insights, of Jacklyn Yuamali Benji Ala—whom Pauline lovingly called ‘angel without
wings’ ( p@ p t@-ma:r-na angel). She spent hours helping me with transcriptions, translations,
explanations, and at the same time cooking, cleaning, looking after her children, and telling the
most wonderful and sophisticated stories. Her help and dedication could never be suﬃciently
acknowledged.
   I owe an eternal debt of gratitude to my Manambu friends and family. I am grateful to
James S@su Laki, Joel Yuakalu Luma, David Yagenmas Takendu, Leo Luma Yambwi, John
Sepaywus, Jamis Katalu Angi Balangawi, K@mbwiyat, and Kulanawi Yuakaw, for sharing their
insights and histories with me. Paul Kat Badaybæg and John Sepaywus were my main teachers
of the Manambu history and lore. Catie Teketa:y, Jennie Kudapa:kw, Lowai, the late Wimali
Yabukwi, Gemaj, Yuawalup, Maguniway, Yipawal, Sawsepali, Tagwatakw, Gaiawalimæg,
Walinum, Ester Yuaya:b, and Ñatabi did not just tell stories and sing women’s songs to me—
they shared their warmth and friendship, and made me feel part of the village.
   Piurkaramb, Leo Kalangas, and Waliaundemi, of Malu, and Aulapan, Seplawan, and Yuk-
waygab, of Yawabak, shared with us stories of the Manambu past. In Malu I was privileged
to meet Duamakwa:y—the oldest man in the Manambu community. Jennie Kudapa:kw,
Yuawalup, and Catie Teketa:y spent hours helping me with transcriptions and translations.
Kawidu (or Rex) was a most patient and insightful teacher, who never tired of correcting my
mistakes. And he was also the greatest canoe guide I ever had—he took us everywhere and
patiently explained what was what. Ken Nayau shared with me his linguistic observations
about Manambu. The late Eric Yuamalen, and his wife Martha Pambwi, taught me things
no one else could. The intuitions of these natural linguists helped put the grammar into shape.
   I learnt a lot—both as a linguist, and as a person—from so many more people. Dameliway,
or simply Damel, has been the warmest friend I have had for years, as was her sister Motuway.
Gemaj—my classiﬁcatory mother—told us the most remarkable stories, and looked after me
as only a mother could. And Karkamb’s (Nelly’s) smile would always make the whole house
joyful. Nelma’s energy and wit brightened our days. Dora and Janet, my classiﬁcatory sisters,
were towers of strength in every way—always full of love and friendship, as was their mother,
Lowai. I greatly enjoyed the company of so many more—not least, Lucy Leo and Ludi (Leo
Yambwi’s wives) with whom I could only communicate in Tok Pisin. Luke Ala (Jager), Jacklyn
Yuamali’s husband, was a remarkable host, and a warm friend.
   Some of my best friends, and dedicated teachers, were children. During my two stays in
Avatip, I learnt more from Jacklyn Yuamali’s Tanina (8 in 2001–2, and 11 in 2004) than from
many adults. Her wit, energy, intelligence, and linguistic intuitions are unsurpassable. By the
time she was 11, she could tell stories almost as well as her grandmother Gemaj. Her little
sister Kerryanne, whom I ﬁrst knew as a 3- and then as a 5-year-old, was a great help—as a
non-stop talker, and also as an ‘assistant nurse’ (one of the duties I assigned her: helping me
perform ﬁrst-aid on other people). Celestin and Stevie (Karkamb’s children) were always at
                                                                    Acknowledgements        xviihand if I had a question to ask. Jennie Kudapa:kw’s son Ryan, Damel’s son Alonso, Gaia’s
daughter Sylvia, and, of course, ever-smiling Simona, the daughter of Teketa:y and Kawidu,
were a source of joy, and most patient and thorough teachers. Janet’s daughter Joana (Zoana)
and Jacklyn’s baby Jemima taught me a lot about how children acquire Manambu and Tok
Pisin. I will always miss my Manambu family.
   Pauline Laki, Albert Yuamuk, Damel, Patrick, Kawindu, Iraman, Leo Yambwi, Maguniwai,
and especially Piurkaramb were instrumental for our trip to Swakap (Swagup). Thanks to
Piurkaramb, we were immediately adopted into Martin Kumwau’s family. I am immensely
grateful for Martin’s and his wife’s hospitality, and for endless hours of patient work on the
Gala language he spent with me, together with Peter, Luke, and Bukakoinben.
   I greatly enjoyed talking to all the Manambu people I met outside the village, in Port
Moresby, Wewak, and Canberra—especially Ruth (Nebekaru), Joel Apikuñ Luma (Pauline
Laki’s elder brother), Mejikay, Jibudam, Ñidewi, Kila, Elizabeth, Paul, and so many more.
And, of course, always cheerful Wanita, Ruth’s and Joel Yuakalu Luma’s daughter! Pauline
Laki’s children, Cassie, Salome, and Kelvin, will always be special to me, just like children of
my own.
   Thanks are also due to Pius Bonjui, himself a Iatmul (from Korogo), the head of the Papua
New Guinea branch of ABC radio in Melbourne. Pius organized an interview for Pauline Laki
on the program Lingua Franca—as a result, many people could hear a Manambu mourning
song and her explanations of the Manambu name ownership. And thank you to Martin
Lawrence, the creator of Lingua Franca, for introducing me to Pius in the ﬁrst place.
   Having a respected anthropologist—Simon Harrison—disentangle the intricacies of the
Manambu culture was a great advantage for me, as a linguist. I am very grateful to him. I was
also fortunate to be in touch with Ross Bowden, an expert on the Kwoma culture, with Colin
Filer, an expert on the Sepik cultures in general, and with Angela Mandie Filer, a sociologist
and herself a Kwoma. Contact with Laurie Bragge, an ex-District Oﬃcer in the Ambunti
area—whose knowledge of the ethnohistories of the Sepik people is truly unsurpassable,—
was precious. Paul Roscoe, an expert on Ndu cultures, and Ulrike Claas, an expert on the
Sepik area, provided valuable references and feedback. I would like to acknowledge my debt
to them.
   Various people read through drafts of various chapters and commented on them. I am
particularly grateful to Matthew Dryer, Nicholas Evans, Bill Foley, Spike Gildea, John Hajek,
Darja Hoenigman, Gerd Jendraschek, Edit Moravcsik, Andrew Pawley, Vera Podlesskaya,
Alan Rumsey, Hilário de Sousa, and Tonya Stebbins. Gerrit Dimmendaal’s expertise in
phonology and phonetics was instrumental in helping Pauline Laki and myself work out the
Manambu vowel system. I greatly proﬁted from frequent interaction with Andrew Pawley,
on various problems in Papuan and Oceanic linguistics. The information on dogs in New
Guinea provided by Jack Golson was invaluable. I also beneﬁted from animated discussions
and information on Iatmul, from Gerd Jendraschek, and from other members of RCLT—Seino
van Breugel, Oliver Iggesen, Mark Post, and Sheena Van Der Mark.
   I would like to acknowledge help and advice from experts in Papuan languages—Alan
Rumsey, Lise Dobrin, Eva Lindström, Karl Franklin, Les Bruce, Darja Hoenigman, and also
Lila San Roque, Ngawae Mitio, Carol Priestley, John Roberts, Tida Syuntaro, Borut Telban,
Ken Sumbuk, and Lourens de Vries. The late Otto Nekitel supported this work, and we still
mourn him.
   I will always be grateful to Tom Dutton—a remarkable teacher of Tok Pisin, and a friend.
I owe a special debt of gratitude to my friends and colleagues in the Summer Institute of
Linguistics at Ukarumpa and Wewak, for their hospitality and their willingness to share
xviii    Acknowledgementsinformation and ideas—René van den Berg, Steve Parker (with whom I could also share ideas
about the Arawak family), Bob and Selma Bugenhagen, as well as Ken Nayau and Robin and
Marva Farnsworth. Cindi and Jim Farr are and will always remain my very special friends—
words will never be enough to express my gratitude to them.
   Invaluable comments on almost every page came from R. M. W. Dixon, without whose
constant encouragement, enthusiasm, criticisms, and support this grammar would never have
eventuated.
   A debt which can never be over-estimated is to Professor Michael Osborne, who welcomed
the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology to La Trobe University and, while he was Vice-
Chancellor, inspired us to create an intellectual atmosphere of the highest quality, commencing
in 2000 and continuing until 2007. This grammar was written within that stimulating ambience.

        Organization and Cross-referencesThis grammar has been written as an integrated whole. To understand what follows one needs
to have digested what precedes. Chapter 1 provides a quick overview of the main points of the
Manambu grammar. Later chapters deal with a particular grammatical topic each.
   Chapter 3 discusses the ways in which grammatical relations are expressed. This chapter
is basic for understanding the rest of the grammar. Chapter 2 contains a detailed discussion
of phonology; it is not necessary to read to understand the rest of the grammar. Chapter 4
gives an overview of all the word classes, and Chapter 11 concentrates on the organization
of verbal morphology, giving a preview of Chapters 12–17. Chapters 18 and 19 deal with
complex clauses. Chapter 20 draws together the structure of clausal constituents, clauses, and
sentences, and discusses the principles and functions of constituent order and of order of
grammatical words within each constituent. Issues in semantics are addressed in Chapter 21.
Those interested in cultural background and historical and comparative problems are advised
to focus on Chapters 1 and 22.
   Examples are numbered separately for each chapter. Examples from texts at the end of the
grammar are referred to with the letter T followed by the number of the text and the sentence
(that is, T2.40 refers to sentence 40 of Text 2).
   All the examples and texts are supplied with an interlinear morpheme gloss, and then trans-
lated into English. Homophonous morphemes are diﬀerentiated by their glosses. The symbol
‘+’ is used to indicate fused morphemes, e.g. taba- is glossed as ‘hand+lk’, its underlying form
being ta:b ‘hand’ (with the long vowel shortened when the linker is added) and -a- ‘linker’.
Portmanteau morphemes are glossed with ‘:’, for instance, mæy ‘come:impv’. All grammatical
morphemes are glossed in small caps while lexical morphemes are in lower case. Pronominal
preﬁxes are shown as 1sg, 3pl, in lower case. For polysemous morphemes, diﬀerent translations
in glosses correspond to diﬀerent meanings.
   Cross-references are of two kinds:
  r Those preceded by § refer to chapter and section number: for instance, §11.1 refers to
    section 1 of Chapter 11;
  r Those beginning with a number refer to examples in the grammar: for instance, 11.1 refers
    to example 1 in Chapter 11.
        Abbreviations and ConventionsHere and passim ‘-’ stands for any morpheme boundary, that is, a boundary between a root
and an aﬃx, or between two roots. The symbol ‘=’ indicates a boundary between a root and a
clitic, or an aﬃx and a clitic, or two clitics (see Chapter 2). The symbol ´ indicates a primary
stress, and ` a secondary stress (obligatory on enclitics). Stress is marked on each example in
Chapter 2 (‘Phonology’) and in other chapters only if relevant to the discussion.
   Manambu has a certain amount of variation between allophones (discussed in Chapter 2).
Many variants depend on the age of the speaker. Examples reﬂect the recurrent individual
variants which also appear in the Vocabulary at the end of the grammar (e.g. kamna:gw, kamna:
‘food’, numa, n@ma ‘big’). Examples throughout the grammar are given in their phonological
representation. Conventions of transcription are addressed in Chapter 2. Loans and code-
switches from Tok Pisin and English are italicized in each example throughout the grammar
(in Chapter 22, Tok Pisin words are italicized and English words are underlined).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"
"                           14.1.1 Negation of verbal predicatesThe general negator ma: negates a verbal predicate of a declarative non-habitual clause. All
person, number, and gender distinctions are neutralized on the verb. We recall, from Chapters
11 and 12, that positive clauses distinguish the past and the versatile tense (which covers near
future, present, and recent past), and also action focus and future. Of these, only future and
non-future are expressed in non-habitual negative clauses. This is shown in Scheme 14.1.
  In negative clauses, person cross-referencing suﬃxes which distinguish tense, and the action
focus marker, are omitted. The non-future tense in negative clauses is expressed by preposing
the negator to a special negative form. This form is often the same as the verb’s root, as in wali-
‘go round’, ma: wali ‘does not/did not go round’. About 50 per cent of verbs undergo vowel
changes described in §11.3.2. These changes are only partially predictable, e.g. gra- ‘cry’, ma:
ga:r ‘does not/did not cry’; g@r- ‘scratch’, ma: ga:r ‘does not/did not scratch’; kur- ‘do/get’, ma:
kwa:r ‘does not/did not do/get’. The origin of these alternations requires further investigation.
  Future tense in negative clauses is marked by postposing the negator ma: to the verb root,
as in gra ma: ‘will not cry’, kur ma: ‘will not work’. Neutralization of person, number, and
gender in negative clauses is not unusual: similar examples can be found, for instance, in some
Balto-Finnic languages (see Aikhenvald and Dixon 1998). That positive and negative clauses
have diﬀerent tense distinctions is rather unusual.
                                                   14.1 Declarative non-habitual clauses       299                      POSITIVE VERB                         NEGATIVE VERB                      versatile tense ± action focus        non-future

ble with negation.
  Examples of a negative non-future are at 14.1–2 (also see 7.5, 7.8, 7.12a, 7.30, 7.57a, and
T3.31). The past versus non-past reference can be disambiguated with a temporal adverb.
14.1 k@ta ma: t@

     ‘Now this (custom) does not exist’
14.2 aw d@ l@-k@-k         ma: s@ma:k     a           l@-k@

     m@d-a         s@p
     cassowary-lk skin
     ‘Then he did not show her cassowary skin to her’
   Non-future negative structures form two phonological and grammatical words. The negator
and the verb do not have to be contiguous—see §14.1.3, on the types and functions of discon-
tinuous non-future negatives.
   Future negation is illustrated in 14.3–4; the future and the non-future negation of the same
verb are contrasted in 14.3. (Further examples are at 7.15 and T3.43.) Unlike in non-future
negation, no constituent can intervene between the verb and the negator. The two form one
phonological word (they remain two grammatical words, and neither is a clitic), and this is
why a linking @ is required in 14.3:
14.3 [ma: ra:p]                 [r@p@             ma:]
     neg be.enough/ﬁt.neg be.enough/ﬁt.neg.fut neg

14.4 [walimaudi-ad]          [wa:l ja         ma:]
     rainbow-3masc.sgnom rain fall.neg neg
     ‘There is rainbow, there will be no rain’
Grammatical relations in negative clauses are marked in the same way as in positive clauses. If
the referent of the subject is not clear from the context, it can be expressed with an overt NP, as
in 7.5. The uninﬂected customary aspect (§12.7) can occur in negative clauses as a complement
of the copula t@-. This is illustrated in 14.5.

                       14.4.1 Non-ﬁrst person negative imperativesThere are three forms with negative imperative meaning, used predominantly with second per-
son reference, and also sometimes with third person reference: the general negative imperative
marked with the suﬃx -tukwa, and two strong prohibitives, -way ‘strong’ and -wayik ‘extra-
strong’.
A. The general prohibitive is marked with the suﬃx -tukwa forming one phonological word
with the root (and therefore requires an automatic @ after a verb root ending in a consonant
to avoid non-authorized consonant clusters). It always bears a secondary stress on its ﬁnal
syllable, e.g. wuk´@-tukwà (hear/listen-proh.gen) ‘do not listen’, bas s´@-tukwà ‘don’t ask’.
   Unlike any other verbal aﬃx, -tukwa can be used with the free form jau ‘let it drop, let it
be’, as in jau tukwa, lit. ‘don’t let it drop’, in the meaning of ‘there is no reason to drop this;
this is important; there is no reason to say jau’ (see §4.5). Such structures are not frequent, and
may be analysed as ‘echo constructions’, because they appear as a reaction to someone saying
jau in the ﬁrst place. The form jau, frequent with positive imperatives, is otherwise not used in
prohibitions.
   Just occasionally, tukwa may be used as a prohibitive ‘don’t’ on its own. This is found in
abrupt elliptical speech. These usages may well be an innovation, due to the fact that -tukwa
is disyllabic and requires secondary stress. Alternatively, they may reﬂect an older usage, and
perhaps even provide justiﬁcation for tracing -tukwa to an independent verb—see the end of
this section. No other prohibitive can be used this way.
   The general negative imperative typically refers to second person, as shown in 14.84–6, and
also 4.58, 13.16, 14.18, and 14.62.
14.84 wali       kudi     yi-tukwa
      white.men language go/say-proh.gen
      ‘Do not speak white man’s language!’
  Since the negative imperative does not encode person distinctions, a pronoun can be added
for disambiguation, as in 14.85, and 14.86.
14.85 m@n        kayk@t@-tukwa
      you.masc. hang.on/touch-proh.gen
      ‘Don’t you touch (my bow and arrow)’
  The personal pronoun can follow the verb, if contrastive, as in T3.7. A general prohibitive is
often accompanied either by an instruction on what to do instead of what is being prohibited
(as in 14.93), or by a statement of the consequences, as in T3.7 and 14.86 (a continuation of
318     14 Negation14.6). This is similar to the situation described for Dyirbal and other Australian languages by
Dixon (1972: 112).
14.86 m@n           al@k         mawul wuk@-tukwa,      aka                        b@

      ‘This is why don’t you worry (lit. you inside don’t worry), having said “She has died
      already”, no, she will get up’
   A prohibitive can be formed on complex predicates, including physical and mental
state constructions (discussed in Chapter 17), as in 14.86 and 14.87a. The corresponding
declarative constructions are at 14.87b and 14.87c: the diﬀerence between these two is in the
focus on the experiencer in 14.87c.

       I       inside/mind go.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘(I) am excited’ (lit. my inside goes up)’
14.87c (wun) mawul            war-na-wun
       I      inside/mind go.up-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am excited’ (lit. I go up (with respect to) my inside)’
   The prohibitive in 14.87a may be interpreted as having third person reference, with a literal
translation ‘may the inside not get excited’, or as having second person reference, ‘may you
not get excited with respect to your inside’. Such constructions are hardly ever used in positive
imperatives. They cannot form second person imperatives, because non-volitional verbs and
states are mutually exclusive with second person imperative (see §13.2.1–2). Theoretically,
they could form third person imperatives—that is, a construction like 14.87d would be gram-
matically acceptable, but culturally questionable. It is in fact not culturally appropriate to
be in a state describable as ‘inside goes up’: this state covers excitement, anger, and further
uncontrollable strong feelings which are considered improper:
14.87d mawul war-kwa
       inside go.up-impv.3p+fem.sg
       ‘May (second/third person) be excited’—?
  We will see in §20.1.4 that mawul here is not a direct object: under no circumstances can it
be cross-referenced on the verb. We return to the concept of mawul in §21.4.
  A general prohibitive can be directed at humans and high animates. In Mali’s family, it is not
uncommon to address inanimate objects with a general prohibitive. In 14.88, Mali was berating
her cooking pots for being lazy and not getting the food cooked quickly enough:
14.88 kwas-@k       yi-tukwa
      small-lk+dat go/say-proh.gen
      ‘Don’t be unwilling!’
  And Tanina, her eldest daughter, instructed a piece of watermelon which was rolling oﬀ the
edge of the ﬂoor:
                                                                14.4 Negative imperative        31914.89 piñu-tukwa
      slide-proh.gen
      ‘Don’t slide!’
  No positive imperative was used this way. Neither can any other prohibitive be addressed to
an inanimate object.
  Unlike the other two non-ﬁrst person negative imperatives, the general -tukwa hardly ever
has obviously non-second person reference. The interpretation of examples in 14.86–87a as
having a third person addressee is possible, but unlikely: they are obviously addressed to
a person, and not to their inside. A prohibition marked with -tukwa can occasionally be
addressed at a third person—an inanimate force, as in 14.90:
14.90 wa:l ja-tukwa         an     yi-ya:k
      rain rain-proh.gen we.du go-red+dat
      ‘May the rain not fall, we two would like to go’ (to a ceremony)
  When used in the direct speech report slot, a -tukwa prohibitive is a way of marking
negative purpose, with non-ﬁrst subject reference. This is a usage not attested with any other
prohibitives:
14.91 [wuk@mar-wuk@mar-tukwa] wa-na-wun
      forget-red-proh.gen               say-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I am telling (you) so that this should not be forgotten (or: so that you should not fully
      forget)’ (lit. I say ‘do not fully forget’)
  As mentioned in §13.2.2, the general prohibitive of wa- ‘say’, wa-tukwa, has an additional
meaning of ‘say it again, I couldn’t agree more’. This is an idiomatic usage which is not shared
with any of the other prohibitives.
B. The strong prohibitives are marked with the suﬃxes -way and -wayik which form one
phonological word with the verb stem to which they attach. Neither suﬃx can be used on its
own, or accompany jau ‘let it drop, let it be’ on its own, unlike the general prohibitive -tukwa.
All monosyllabic verbs and a few other verbs require a formative -k- in the strong prohibitive
(see §11.3.2), e.g. wa-k-wayik ‘do not ever say’, k@-k-wayik ‘do not ever eat’.
   The two strong prohibitives diﬀer from the general prohibitive in their illocutionary force.
For instance, if a mischievous child is told 14.92a, it is likely that she will pay no attention and
wait and see what happens next.
14.92a kur-tukwa         ñ@n-a-k@-l          ma:
       do/get-proh.gen you.fem-lk-obl-fem.sg neg
       ‘Do not take (this), it is not yours’
   A parent who is really annoyed and does not want the child to keep on reaching out for what
is not hers is likely to shout:
14.92b kur-way!
       neg-proh.str
       ‘Do not take (this)!!’
  On saying this, a parent is likely to get hold of something heavy to throw at the child. The
child gets a bit edgy, preparing to start running away; and she is likely to stop what she was
doing. If she does not, or the parent is not satisﬁed with the eﬀect, 14.92c follows:
320     14 Negation14.92c kur-wayik!
       neg-proh.extra
       ‘Do not take (this)!!!’
   On hearing this, the child is oﬀ in a ﬂash—she knows for a fact that the parent is well and
truly annoyed, and will hit her if she does not disappear.
   The two strong prohibitives are similar in their behaviour. We saw above that the general
prohibitive is very often accompanied by a statement of what may happen otherwise, as shown
in 14.86 and 14.93 (partly repeated from 7.21):
14.93 [ [a               w@pak-a:m]            v@-ku]         a-d@               yab@m
      dem.dist+fem.sg type.of.tree-lk+loc see-compl.ss dem.dist-masc.sg road+lk+loc
      yi-tukwa      k@-d@                 mapa-taba       yab@-r@b         ma:y
      go-proh.gen dem.prox-masc.sg right-hand+lk road+lk-fully go.impv
      ‘Having seen the tree (whose leaf I put on the ground), do not go on that road, go straight
      onto the road on the right-hand side’
   In contrast, a strong prohibitive often occurs unaccompanied by such statements. Strong and
extra-strong prohibitions are likely to occur on their own—they are so strong that the addressee
is supposed to be aware of the consequences anyway. Or the consequences of disobedience may
be such that the speaker does not want to stress them. Example 14.94 is a strongish prohibition:
a bush boy has to wear a grass skirt at all times.
14.94 ak@tawa kwa:r         l@pa-way
      like.this grass.skirt break-proh.str
      ‘Don’t you ever undo (break) your grass skirt’
  In 14.95, the spirit instructs the woman to never ever look inside her stringbag. She disobeys
and the consequences are disastrous—her little son becomes a monster:
14.95 k@-d@              wur@m                s@m@rab k@ta-d
      dem.prox-masc.sg string.bag+lk+loc never.ever look.dir-down
      v@-k-wayik          d@-k@-m       kaja-saki-n-a:b                v@-k-wayik
      look-ep-proh.extra he-obl-loc open.up-across.away-seq-too look-ep-proh.extra
      ‘Never ever look down into this stringbag, do not ever look by opening it sideways’
  A reason for the prohibition, but not the consequence, can be stated; however, this has only
been attested with the strong, but not the extra-strong, prohibitive:
14.96 [k@                mi: v@l-way]          [wun-a       ta:kw k@-na-wur
      dem.prox.fem.sg tree cut-proh.str I-lk+fem.sg woman dem.prox-curr.rel-up
      ñan kur-@n         r@-na]
      child do/get-seq sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Do not cut this tree, my wife is sitting up there having a baby’
  Either of the strong prohibitives can be accompanied by an inherently negative form
s@m@rab, s@ma:b, or s@ms@ma:b ‘never ever’, as in 14.95 (see §14.6). Neither can have an
inanimate addressee, in contrast to the general prohibitive. Strong prohibitives are not used
with verbs of mental states—the general prohibitive is preferred in such contexts (14.86–7).
  Either of the strong prohibitives may refer to a third person, much more frequently so than
the general prohibitive -tukwa. We also saw, at 14.90, that -tukwa may be used with a non-
human third person agent. In contrast, a third person with either of the strong prohibitives
                                                                14.4 Negative imperative       321always has a human referent. In 14.97, the third person is explicitly stated, and in 14.98 it
was understood from the context. A taboo stated with a negated nominalization in 14.97 is
reinforced with the prohibitive, to make sure the audience understands the strength of the ban.
14.97 [du-a-ñanugw       v@-v@      ma:] [du-a-ñanugw         v@-k-wayik]
      man-lk-children see-red neg man-lk-children see-ep-proh.extra
      ‘Boys are not to see (girls in seclusion at the time of their ﬁrst menstruation), boys should
      not see (them) under any circumstances’
14.98 ya-k-wayik
      come-ep-proh.extra
      ‘He should not come in’ (accompanied with a sign reference to an unwanted guest)
  A strong prohibitive can be used as an apprehensive—meaning ‘lest’, ‘or else’, as in 14.99.
This expresses the prohibition not to cook the manioc and the white hairy yam together:
14.99 a-di        ñan     kamkaw          nakalib kwata-ku       kiya-way
      dem.dist-pl manioc white.hairy.yam together cook-compl.ss die-proh.str
      ‘Do not cook manioc and white hairy yam together lest you die’ (lit. Having cooked
      manioc and white hairy yam together may you not die!)
  A similar example with an extra-strong prohibitive -wayik is at 14.100.
14.100 d@b-a:m         ata kwa-l                  [wali         kamna:gw

       eat-3fem.sg-compl.ds bad          stay-ep-proh.extra
       ‘She sat inside the fence (that is, in a ritual enclosure, having her ﬁrst menstruation),
       having eaten white people’s food, she might be sick’
  Apprehensive usages of the strong prohibitives express a highly undesirable consequence of
a previously ﬁnalized action described with a dependent clause.
  Either of the two strong prohibitives can be used as a causative strategy, mirroring the similar
usages typical of the positive imperatives (see §13.2.2, examples 13.23–5):
14.101 wun-a:k [k@-l@-m                  s@kul@k ay]       wa-k-wayik
       I-lk+dat dem.prox-fem.sg-loc cooking impv+do say-ep-proh.extra
       ‘Do not you tell me to cook here!’ or ‘Don’t make me cook there!’
   The properties of the two strong prohibitives and of the general prohibitive are contrasted
in Table 14.1.
   Table 14.1 shows that, besides the diﬀerences in the strength of a prohibition (illustrated in
14.92a–c), the three prohibitives diﬀer in their morphosyntactic properties, and in actual usage.
   Languages of the world tend to have fewer prohibitives than they have positive imperatives
(Aikhenvald forthcoming a); there are, however, a few languages where more distinctions are
expressed in negative than in positive commands. Manambu is one such example: there are
three prohibitives, with just one positive counterpart. The positive imperative is richer than
the negative imperatives in just one respect: ﬁrst person imperative only exists in the positive
polarity. However, the seeming scarcity of positive imperative forms is compensated for by a
large array of command strategies—see Table 19.5 in §19.9.
The etymology of the three prohibitives is unknown—there are no clear cognates of any of
these in any of the Ndu languages. We hypothesize that the form -tukwa may be derived

from a third person imperative of the verb t@- ‘be, have, stand’, t@-kwa (stand/be/have-
impv.3p+3fem.sg) ‘let it stand/be/have’. (Note that, as shown in §2.1.2, t@kwa is an alter-
native realization of tukwa.) This etymology is corroborated by typological analogy—non-
infrequently, prohibitives come from expressions like ‘stop, let it be, leave it’ (Heine and Kuteva
2002; Aikhenvald forthcoming a; and similar developments suggested in Dixon 1972: 112).
   The strong prohibitive marker -way- is homonymous with the inherently reduplicated form
wayway ‘maybe, posssibly’. The component way- also occurs in the interjection wayay, wayey
‘oh dear’; but any etymological connection with the prohibitive is dubious.
   The formative -ik in -wayik may well be related to the conﬁrmation marker -@k (see §12.5;
and note that @ is pronounced as [i] in the context of a palatal glide y: see §2.1.2), given that the
strong negative imperative -way diﬀers from -wayik in the degree of strength, or ‘assertiveness’.","[344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349]"

                          14.3.1 Negation of irrealis and optativeWe mentioned in §13.3 and in §12.2 that future and irrealis modality (both marked with the
suﬃx -k@-) are formally distinguished by the way in which they are negated. While the negative
future consists of a verb root followed by the negator ma: (see §14.1.1), the negative irrealis
310      14 Negationis formed with the negator ak@s (same as the habitual negator discussed in §14.2) followed
by a fully inﬂected verb. The negative irrealis consists of two independent grammatical and
phonological words.
   The negative irrealis can be used in main clauses without an overtly stated condition, and
in main clauses (also known as apodosis) in conditional sentences. Examples in main clauses
include 13.35, and 14.52–3. The negative irrealis typically refers to something that could have
happened but did not.
14.52 aka                        k@p ak@s      ras@-k-na
      dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg just neg.irr get.up-irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Then (the war) would not have arisen by itself (without provocation)’
  In 14.53 a positive future form is contrasted to a negative irrealis. The future reading of ‘I
will do’ is determined by the context: an irrealis meaning is not appropriate here since this is
what the man is determined to do.
14.53 a-r@b-a:b                    ata r@ka:r@k kur-k@-tua

      neg.irr in.sloppy.way do/get-irr-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Then in a straight way too I will treat (lit. do) her correctly, I would never treat her in a
      sloppy way’
  A negative irrealis form in a main clause can express mild commands and wishes, as in
13.37–8. The irrealis in 14.54 expresses a strong wish:
14.54 ak@s    kus t@-k@-k-na-ñ@na!
      neg.irr cold have-irr-irr-act.foc-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘May you well and truly not get a cold!’
  A negative irrealis in a conditional sentence expresses a counterfactual event—something
that could have happened under a counterfactual condition expressed with a verb marked for
future or irrealis. A clause expressing condition (also known as protasis) is juxtaposed to the
main clause (see §19.1 on juxtaposed clauses).
  Examples with a positive clause expressing counterfactual condition with irrealis are at 13.36
and 14.55. In 13.36, we know that the man did not behave as a good uncle ought to have
behaved; hence the irrealis reading of the juxtaposed conditional clause. Similarly, in 14.55, we
know from the story that the magic woman did not give us her magic—if she had, we would
have had a lot of money (which we do not have).
14.55 [ [la                 yanu kway-ma:r-l@-l@k]                           yawi suan

      ‘Since she did not give magic, we work hard. Had she given magic, money too would
      have never ﬁnished, money, money too, never’
  We will see, in §14.5, that the distinction between negative future and negative irrealis is
neutralized in dependent clauses: the marking -ma:r-k@- (neg.sub-fut/irr) is used for both.
                                             14.3 Negation of non-indicative modalities      311That is, whether the condition is counterfactual or not can only be decided in the context of a
whole sentence. The form of the verb in a main clause may provide additional clues.
   For example, 14.56 is ambiguous as to whether the condition is counterfactual or not: the
main clause form is ambiguous between irrealis and future. Inserting a time word—such as s@r
‘tomorrow’ or nal ‘yesterday’—would have disambiguated this sentence.
14.56 [væki-ma:r-k-la]
      go.across-neg.sub-fut/irr-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [da-k-na-wun]
      go.down-fut/irr-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
      ‘If she does not go across, I will go down (to meet her)’ or
      ‘If she had not gone across, I would have gone down (to meet her)’
  In contrast, 14.57 can only have a counterfactual reading because of the negative irrealis
form in the main clause.
14.57 [væki-ma:r-k-la]                                          [ak@s

      da-k-na-wun]
      go.down-fut/irr-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
      ‘If she had not gone across, I would not have gone down (to meet her)’
  And 14.58 is not counterfactual since the main clause contains a non-irrealis form:
14.58 [gan@b s@         kwa-ma:r-k@-tua,]
      morning sleep lie-neg.sub-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [sik t@-kwa-na-wun]
      sick be-hab-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
      ‘If I do not sleep (the next) morning, I usually am sick’
  An adverb, a copula complement, or the object of ‘have’ can intervene between the irrealis
negator and the inﬂected verb, as shown in 14.54 and 14.59. In contrast to the habitual negator
ak@s (see, for example, 14.48) inserting more than one-word constituents between the irrealis
negator and the verb results in unnatural expressions.
14.59 Simon Harrison d@-k@-d@         buk ak@s        kuprap

      be/become-irr-irr-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Simon Harrison’s book would not have got bad (if we had proper storage space)’
Just as with discontinuous constructions involving the habitual negator ak@s, the eﬀect is that
of focusing on the constituent which is placed after the negator.
   Just like the habitual negator ak@s in 14.50, the irrealis negator can be used elliptically if
the irrealis value is immediately recoverable from the context—this was illustrated in 14.55.
However, it cannot be used as a negative response (unlike the habitual negator in 14.51).
   The irrealis negator ak@s is also used to negate the optative modality formed on irrealis, as
in 13.40. Another example is at 14.60: this is a very strong wish for the unwanted guest not to
turn up:
14.60 ak@s    ya-k@-na-d-@u
      neg.irr come-irr-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-opt
      ‘May he not come!!!’
312     14 Negation   Negative optative constructions are rare in discourse. They cannot be discontinuous, and do
not occur in non-main clauses (we recall, from §13.2.3 and §13.3, that the positive optative does
not occur in non-main clauses either). The optative modality formed on ﬁrst and third person
imperatives cannot be negated (see §14.4 for negative imperatives).
   Are the two morphemes with the same shape—ak@s ‘habitual negative’ and ak@s ‘irrealis
negator’—the same morpheme or diﬀerent morphemes? Synchronically speaking, they are
better considered as distinct, given that the conditions of their use, their meanings, and
syntactic properties are diﬀerent. Diachronically speaking, the question remains open. It is not
uncommon for irrealis and habitual to be expressed with the same morpheme—as, for instance,
English would. However, since analogy is not a proof, the question concerning any etymological
link between the two forms with the shape ak@s remains open until more comparative data
become available.","[336, 337, 338, 339]"

                         20.1.3 Clause types and their propertiesThe major clause types in Manambu are (A) declarative, (B) imperative, and (C) interrogative.
Exclamatory clauses have the same structure as declarative clauses; they diﬀer from them
in their sharply falling intonation (§2.7). The imperative is only used in imperative main, or
independent, clauses. Other clauses can be either dependent or independent.
A. Declarative clauses. The major distinguishing features of independent, or main, clauses
and dependent clauses of various types were summarized in Table 19.1. The most prominent
features include:
  r Constituent order is not necessarily ﬁxed in main clauses (see §20.2) but is almost always
      ﬁxed in dependent clauses;
  r Any word class can head a predicate of main clause, while only verbs can head the predi-
    cate of a dependent clause; non-verbs have to occur as copula complements in dependent
    clauses;
  r The use of uninﬂected modal and aspectual forms is allowed only in main clauses; these
    same forms require support verbs when used in dependent clauses;
  r Main clauses distinguish future negation, past negation, habitual negation (and also see
    Chapter 14), while all the dependent clauses are negated with -ma:r- ‘dependent clause
    negator’.
That uninﬂected modal and aspectual forms require support verbs when used in dependent
clauses indicates that they are less ‘verbal’ and more noun-like than inﬂected verbs. This is a
property they share with non-verbs as predicate heads: in order to be used in dependent clauses,
non-verbs have to occur as copula complements of the verb t@- which is also used as the most
frequent support verb (see §17.2)—an example is at 20.26.
                                                                 20.1 Major constituents        519  The ﬁrst clause is an independent clause with a non-agreeing adjective in the predicate slot.
This is an example of a non-verbal clause. The second clause is a medial dependent clause
which contains a copula t@- and the same adjective in the copula complement slot. There is
no other way in which an adjective can appear in the predicate slot in a dependent clause (a
similar example is at T3.23). The third clause is a main clause, of the verbless type.20.26 [vyakat-ad]          [vyakat t@-ku]            [ya:kya]
      good-3masc.sgnom good         stand-compl.ss OK
      ‘It (masculine) was/is good. As it was good, (this was) OK’   As expected, main declarative clauses distinguish more grammatical categories than depen-
dent clauses. However, as we will see shortly, not all main clauses distinguish all categories.
   Main declarative clauses divide into three types: verbal, non-verbal, and verbless. Verbal
clauses can be headed by a fully inﬂected, a partially inﬂected, or an uninﬂected verb (see
§11.1.1). The number of inﬂectional positions depends on the category—for instance, positive
indicative verbs are always fully inﬂected, while imperatives (see B below) are partially inﬂected,
and negative indicative verbs are uninﬂected (unless they are in the habitual aspect)—see
Table 11.1. Verbal clauses express the full set of tense, aspect, mood, and modality distinc-
tions (detailed in Chapters 13–14), and can be headed by intransitive, transitive, ambitran-
sitive, and ditransitive verbs—see §4.2.1. Or they can be headed by a copula—see under
B §4.2.2.
   Copula clauses in Manambu contain polyfunctional verbs in their predicate slot. There
are ten such verbs, and they can each be used as copula verbs, as support verbs, and also as
auxiliaries. In addition, ﬁve of them are also used as lexical verbs. A summary of these verbs
and their functions is in Table 4.1.
   When used as copula verbs, they head the predicate of copula clauses which involve
two arguments but cannot be considered transitive or intransitive (see Dixon 2002b for a
typological overview of copulas; also see §17.1).
   The relationship between the two arguments of a copula clause—the copula subject and
the copula complement—covers identity, attribution, location, and possession. Their choice
depends on (a) the meaning of the copula construction, and (b) the semantic type of copula
complement.
   We saw, both in Table 4.1 and examples 4.16–19, that copula clauses containing copulas t@-
‘be, stand’, r @- ‘sit’, and kwa- ‘stay’ are used to express location and existence (also see T1.32,
T2.67, and T3.43, for t@-; T2.4 and T2.7 for r @-; and T1.11 and T1.14 for kwa-). A similar
example is at 20.30.
   The copula t@- —the most versatile in terms of its semantics—can also imply ‘coming into
existence’. The stative existential meaning and the more dynamic meaning of ‘appearing’ can
only be distinguished by context.
   Consider 20.27. Its ﬁrst clause (which is a relative clause) contains the existential copula
r @- ‘sit (overtone of horizontal position)’. This copula never has any overtone of ‘coming into
existence’. It is used here because living or staying in an area is typically associated with a
horizontal location and treated as ‘sitting’. This is reminiscent of classiﬁcatory verbs found in
some New Guinea languages—we saw, in §17.1.1, that despite some classiﬁcatory overtones,
positional verbs in Manambu cannot really be considered classiﬁcatory.
   The second clause of 20.27 contains the copula t@- meaning ‘become, come into being’. This
same clause may also mean ‘a lake was (there)’, but this is not the reading implied by the
context of the story.

      before sit-1plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p area then lake become+3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘In the area where we used to be (lit. sit) a lake came into being’
  The copula t@- is also used in the meaning of ‘become’, as in 3.8–9 and 20.28–9. These exam-
ples show that the copula complement of ‘become’ can be a noun (as in 20.28 and T2.42), or
an adjective (as in 20.29). In T1.8, the copula complement is a deictic adverb, atawa ‘like that’.

      dem.prox-masc.sg village that.is.why big-masc.sg become-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘That is why this village has become big’
  It is also used in the meaning of ‘have’ with any kind of possessum, as in 4.18, 8.16, and
14.33. In T1.4 a clause with t@- can be interpreted either as existential (‘the sickness which
exists on/to us-our village women’) or as possessive (‘the sickness we-our village women have’).
  The verb t@- is not used to express identity or equation; neither are the two other postural
verbs. The verb kwa- ‘stay’ can be used in the meaning of ‘become and remain’, as shown in
the last clause in 20.30:
20.30 [ [ta:y waku-na-di]                   yibunmi-a:b a:li t@-na-di]              [samasa:m

      kwa-bana-l@k]
      stay-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-because
      ‘There are also four chiefs (lit. chiefs who go out ﬁrst), because we remain numerous’
  This is consistent with its lexical meaning of ‘staying’ and the way it is used in aspectual
complex predicates to express prolonged durative meaning.
  Other polyfunctional verbs used as copulas express identity and attribution. Their choice
depends on the copula complement and in fact is only partly predictable.
  As mentioned at B in §4.2.2, the copula verbs na- ‘be (of physical states; natural phenom-
ena)’, tay -‘be (of climatic states)’, yasa-/yas@- ‘be (of physical states, e.g. hunger, thirst)’, and
say- ‘be (of some states, e.g. shame or pins and needles)’ allow an additional option. They
can take third person feminine cross-referencing, with the experiencer optionally added if
appropriate. Examples are at 20.31a–34a. Or the experiencer can be cross-referenced on the
copula verb. Examples are at 20.31b–34b. There are no restrictions on the person of the
experiencer.
  Each of the examples at (a) in 20.31–2 allows for two interpretations, no matter whether the
overt experiencer is present or not (see §20.4.3 on ellipsis): they either refer to a general state
of aﬀairs, or to the feelings or state of an experiencer participant. Examples at (b) only refer
to the state of the experiencer. As always in Manambu, the overt NP can be omitted. The two
readings (i) and (ii) are equally frequent, and only context provides the clue. The person does
not have to be ‘I’—there are no restrictions on the person choice.

       (I)    cold be:clim-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am cold’
The preferential reading for example 20.33a is (i)—that is, these sentences refer to the feelings
of a particular experiencer (not necessarily ﬁrst person).
20.33a (wun) bag                    say-na
       (I)       pins.and.needles be:feel-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       (i) ‘I feel pins and needles’
       (ii) ‘It gives one a feeling of “pins and needles”; there is a feeling of “pins and needles” ’
20.33b (wun) bag                 say-na-wun
       I        pins.and.needles be:feel-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I feel pins and needles’
   And example 20.34a has only one reading—it can only refer to hunger (or other physical
feelings: see 4.26a–d):
20.34a (wun) ka:m yasa-na
       I      hunger be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am hungry’
20.34b (wun) ka:m yasa-na-wun
       I      hunger be:desire-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am hungry’
   In contrast, the meaning of the (b) examples at 20.31–4 is pretty uniform: ﬁrst, they always
imply the presence of an experiencer—cross-referenced on the verb—and secondly, the speaker
is focusing on the state of the experiencer—who is also topical. This is why it is underlined in
the translations.
   This is very similar to the alternations in cross-referencing we already saw in ‘body part
constructions’ many of which use the copula or polyfunctional verbs discussed here—see §17.4,
and especially examples 17.57–9. A similar example, with the word mawul ‘insides; feelings’,
appears in 14.87. Along similar lines, a normal way of saying ‘I am angry’ is 20.35a. This is
another example of a body part construction.
20.35a (wun) ya:l gra-na
       (I)    belly cry-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am angry’
  If I want to focus on my anger, to make sure people understand that I am well and truly
angry, I would say:
20.35b (wun) ya:l gra-na-wun
       (I)    belly cry-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am angry’
522      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices  In each of these cases, the choice of a pattern—whether to cross-reference an experiencer or
not—has repercussions on the use of switch-reference in clause chaining. We recall, from §18.3,
that body part constructions and copula clauses with these four verbs usually trigger diﬀerent
subject medial markers even if the experiencer is the same as the subject of a subsequent clause,
as in 18.24 and 20.36a:
20.36a [wus yasa-l@-k]                      [a-wa-j@wi]
       urine be:desire-3fem.sg-compl.ds impv-say-be.awake
       ‘If you feel like peeing wake (me up)’
  The independent clause alternative for the ﬁrst clause in 20.36a is 20.36b, where the experi-
encer is not cross-referenced on the copula verb.
20.36b (ñ@n)     wus yasa-na
       you.fem urine be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘You feel like peeing’
This clause was used as a juxtaposed dependent clause in (i), a version of 20.36a:
20.36c [wus yasa-na]                          [a-wa-j@wi]
       urine be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt impv-say-be.awake
       ‘If you feel like peeing wake (me up)’
  However, as we saw in §18.3 (18.25–6), if the subject is topical, it can be treated as ‘same’ with
respect to switch-reference even within a body part construction. Such examples also occur
with copula verb structures illustrated in 20.31–4 above, but they are less frequent. Another
example is in 20.37.
20.37 [abakapi ata ka:m yasa-d]                           [ka:m yasa-ku,]    [ya:k]
      hawk     then hunger be:desire-3masc.sgbas.p hunger be:desire-compl.ss OK
      ‘The hawk then felt hunger, after he felt hunger, it was OK’
As we saw in 17.60, even if the experiencer is cross-referenced on the polyfunctional copula verb
yas@-/yasa- ‘be (of desires)’ in a main clause, it may not be cross-referenced on an adjacent
dependent clause. Another rare example of the experiencer cross-referenced on copula verb
within a dependent clause is at 20.63. We return to this phenomenon—rather pervasive in
Papuan languages—in §20.1.4.
   Unlike the four copula verbs discussed above, the verb yæy- ‘be: of smell’ does not refer to a
feeling by any particular experiencer; typical examples are at 4.28 and 20.38.
20.38 du-a-jig@r@pa            ya:m yæy-na
      man-lk-bodysmell+lk smell be:smell-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘There is a smell of human body’
      ∗
        ‘I smell human body’, ∗ ‘I emit a smell’
  We already mentioned in §4.5 that the copula subject behaves like any other subject. In
contrast, the copula complement of any copula verb is diﬀerent from any other type of
argument. It can never be cross-referenced on the copula verb. A copula complement cannot
be case marked, or independently focused in a highlighting focus construction (§20.3).
  None of the copula clauses can form an imperative. The verbs t@-, r @-, and kwa- do form
imperatives when used in their positional senses (‘stand’, ‘sit’, and ‘stay’ respectively). The
copula na- ‘be: of physical states, natural phenomena’ can occur in a command phrased as a
                                                                20.1 Major constituents        523sequencing clause chain only if used as a support verb (see §17.2.3 and example 17.36a). Other
than that, copula clauses have all the properties of verbal clauses.
   We now turn to non-verbal clauses, that is, clauses which have a member of a word class
other than a verb in their predicate slot. We saw in §3.1 that non-verbs in the predicate slot
require nominal cross-referencing enclitics cross-referencing their subject (see Table 3.4). This
cross-referencing is not tense sensitive—that is, the tense distinctions expressed in verbs are not
marked for non-verbal predicates.
   As mentioned in §12.1, to express tense, aspect, or any other further categories, non-verbs
have to be used as complements of a support verb (most frequently, t@- ‘be, have, stand’). Also,
if a non-verbal clause is to be used in a depedent clause, the non-verbal predicate has to occur
with the support verb—see further discussion in §17.2.3.
   Non-verbal predicates are negated diﬀerently from verbs—see §14.1.2, and especially
Scheme 14.2. The negator ma: is postposed to the non-verb, and the person, number, and
gender cross-referencing enclitics are suppressed. We can recall that, to negate a non-future
declarative non-habitual verb, the same negator is preposed to a special negative verb form
stripped of any cross-referencing. And to negate a future declarative non-habitual verb, the
negator is postposed to the verb root (which is often diﬀerent from the negative non-future
form: see §14.1.1). These tense distinctions in negative declarative verbs are irrelevant for
negative non-verbs. Example 20.39 recapitulates these correlations: 20.39a is an example of
a non-future declarative negative verbal clause; 20.39b is the same example cast in the future;
and 20.39c is a non-verbal negative clause. The only feature declarative negative verbal and
non-verbal clauses share is the lack of personal cross-referencing.
20.39a ñan ma: t@
       child neg have+neg
       ‘(I/you/we/they etc.) do not/did not have a child’
20.39b ñan t@            ma:
       child have+neg neg
       ‘(I/you/we/they etc.) will not have a child’
20.39c vyak@t ma:
       good neg
       ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) is not/was not/will not be good’
  In 20.39d–e, vyak@t occurs with t@- as a support verb or as a copula (with the meaning of
‘become’)—and this support verb behaves as a normal verb, with all the appropriate tense and
other distinctions:
20.39d vyakat ma: t@
       good neg sup.vb+neg
       (a) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) is not/was not good’—support verb
       (b) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) does not/did not become good’—copula clause
20.39e vyakat t@              ma:
       good sup.vb+neg neg
       (a) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) will not be good’—support verb
       (b) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) will not become good’—copula clause
  We can recall, from §14.1.2 (also see the discussion above), that 20.39d–e are ambiguous in
yet another way: the verb t@- with a non-verb may also be understood as a copula, ‘become’.
524     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesHence the reading (b) for each of 20.39d–e. Nothing but context can help us decide. Just like
copula clauses, non-verbal clauses are not used in commands.
  The subject of both copula and non-verbal clauses can occur in the highlighting focus
construction, just like any subject of an intransitive clause (S)—see §20.3.
  Cross-linguistically speaking, the meanings expressed with non-verbal clauses in Manambu
are, in the majority, associated with copula clauses—see Dixon (2002). We discuss them one by
one.
I. Identity and equation are illustrated in 20.40, and in T1.6, T1.16, T2.8, T2.24, and the
second clause of T2.27.
20.40 k@-di         du-adi
      dem.prox-pl man-3plnom
      ‘These (ones) were/are people’
  The subject can be omitted, as in 20.41.
20.41 wagi-adi
      eel-3plnom
      ‘They are eels’
  We can recall from §8.2 that an alternative to a construction with ‘have’ is what can be called
identiﬁcation construction whereby the possessor is the subject of a non-verbal clause, and
the possessed noun occupies the predicate slot. These constructions tend to be employed if the
possessive relationship is conceived of as a permanent one, as, for instance, belonging to a clan,
as in 8.21–5, clauses 6 and 7 of T2.27, and 20.42. In the last clause of T2.26 an ‘identiﬁcation
construction’ is cast as a question.
20.42 wun gabak-ad@wun-@k
      (I) Gabak.clan-1masc.sgnom-conf
      ‘I am a member of Gabak clan’
This is akin to predicative possession, further illustrated at 20.43–4.
II. Predicative possession and purpose are illustrated in 20.43–5. In 20.43, a headless posses-
sive marked with -k@- (see §8.1) heads the predicate; a similar example is at 8.14. The ‘double’
gender marking is discussed in §8.1.
20.43 d@-k@-l-al
      he-poss-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom
      ‘She is his (wife)’
  A predicative possessive construction can be used as an alternative to a clan-identiﬁcation
construction, with little semantic diﬀerence. The only diﬀerence is pragmatic: in 20.42 the
speaker fully identiﬁes with the clan, while 20.44 simply states the fact of the clan membership.
20.44 yabun kwalgud@mi d@ sablap gwalugw-@-k@-d-ad
      (name) (name)      he Sablap clan-lk-poss-masc.sg-3masc.sgnom
      ‘Yabun Kwalgud@mi, he is of Sablap clan’
  We recall, from 8.24, that the identiﬁcation construction is a preferred rhetorical device in a
name debate, where clan membership and the ensuing name ownership are of vital importance.
  In 20.45, a dative form, ‘for you’, heads the predicate:
                                                                20.1 Major constituents        52520.45 k@                  na:gw m@n-a:k-al
      dem.prox+fem.sg sago you.masc-lk+dat-3fem.sgnom
      ‘This sago is for you/yours’III. Naming illustrated in 20.46 can also be expressed with a non-verbal clause:
20.46 wun-a-d@     s@      ma: Sepaywus-ad
      I-lk-masc.sg name again Sepaywus-3masc.sgnom
      ‘My name, again, is Sepaywus’
  Agreement is with the ‘owner’ of the name. Unlike possessive noun phrases (§8.1.1), posses-
sor and not the possessee can be considered ‘head’ here.
IV. Attribution is consistently expressed through non-verbal clauses with an adjective, a
number or a quantiﬁer in the predicate slot, as in 20.47, 20.26, and 20.39c above.
20.47 du viti-ab@r
      man two-3dunom
      ‘Men were/are two’V. Similarity is also expressed with non-verbal clauses. Any word class marked with the suﬃx
-p@k ‘like’ or -r@b ‘fully like’ (see §9.2) or a noun followed by the postposition k@t@k ‘like, as’
(§4.5.2) can occupy the predicate slot, as in T1.5 and 20.48.
20.48 l@-k@              amæy-p@k-al
      she-poss+fem.sg mother-like-3fem.sgnom
      ‘She is like her mother’
  The suﬃx -r@b does not necessarily require nominal cross-referencing: as shown in 9.29, a
noun with -r@b can occupy the predicate slot without any marking. Consider 20.49a and b
which are almost synonymous. The diﬀerence is slight: 20.49a was used as a general statement
pronounced after a lengthy discussion of what the Gala language is like. In contrast, 20.49b
was an immediate reaction to a few rather striking cognates between Gala and Manambu:
20.49a ñan-a kudi-r@b-a
       we-lk language-fully-3fem.sgnom
       ‘This is fully like our language’ (a general statement based on a lengthy discussion)
20.49b ñan-a kudi-r@b
       we-lk language-fully
       ‘This is fully like our language’ (a spontaneous statement based on a couple of cog-
       nates)
   These two examples represent diﬀerent structures: 20.49b and 9.29 are verbless clauses—see
below.
   Non-verbal clauses can also be used for pointing, as in T1.14, bap ka (moon
dem.prox+3fem.sgnom) ‘This is the moon’. This is only possible if a nominal demonstrative
is in the predicate slot. Otherwise a verbless clause is the preferred option.
   Non-verbal clauses feature prominently in highlighting focus constructions—see §20.3.
   A special subtype of non-verbal clauses is clauses whose predicate is a manner adver-
bial demonstrative or a reactivated topic demonstrative. As we saw in §§10.2.2–3, each
of these takes the predicative marker -n(-). The adverbial demonstrative takes -n- accom-
panied by third person feminine singular nominal cross-referencing, as in akatawa-n-a
526      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices(like.this.anaph-pred-3fem.sgnom) ‘this is it, this is how it is’. And a reactivated topic demon-
strative takes -n accompanied with its copy marked for number and gender, e.g. aka-n-aka
(dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘that is it’. Another example is at 20.52b.
   If a clause with an adverbial demonstrative is negated, the predicative marker is omitted, e.g.
akatawa ma: ( (like.this.anaph neg) ‘this is not like this’). To negate a clause with a reactivated
topic in its predicate slot one uses a biclausal structure, with the pro-clause ma: ‘it is not
the case’, as a separate clause, e.g. aka-n-aka [pause] ma: (react.top.dem.dist.fem.sg-pred-
react.top.fem.sg neg) ‘that is it—no’, meaning ‘this is not at all the case’. This is very similar
to how ma: was used in 14.152–4 (§14.6), also to negate clauses.
   Neither the adverbial demonstratives nor the reactivated topic demonstratives can occur
with a support verb. Nor can they occur in any dependent clause; or be used in the highlighting
focus construction (§20.3). These properties are similar to those of verbless clauses—our next
topic.
   Verbless clauses contain no verb and no cross-referencing. No tense-aspect distinctions can
be expressed; these clauses cannot be employed in clause chaining, or as complement clauses.
They are negated in the same way as non-verbal clauses: with postposed negator ma:. Unlike
copula clauses, no constituent can be in highlighting focus.
   The word classes employed in verbless clause are rather limited. The semantic types covered
include:
i. Naming and identity can be expressed with a verbless clause, as in 20.50a–b, and T2.1.
20.50a wun Walin@m
       I     Walinum
       ‘I am Walinum’
20.50b wun-a       s@    Walin@m
       I-lk+fem.sg name Walinum
       ‘My name is Walinum’
Identity expressed with a verbless clause involves a clan name (or associated totems) or a
kinship name in the second position (as in the ﬁrst clause of T2.1 and the third clause of
T2.27, and 20.51). Using any other word class there would be awkward.
20.51 wun d@makau       kanukaraki
      I    brown.snake death.adder
      ‘I am brown snake, death adder’ (that is, I belong to a clan whose totems are brown
      snake and death adder)
   We saw in 20.46 above that a non-verbal clause can be used for naming. In fact, 20.46 (‘my
name, again, is Sepaywus’) and the ﬁrst clause of T2.1 (‘I am father’s brother, Sepay’) were
used by the same person, for diﬀerent stories. Another possibility would be to use a non-verbal
clause in the meaning of identity: wun S@paywus-ad@wun (I Sepaywus-1masc.sgnom) ‘I am
Sepaywus’. Verbless clauses are statistically the most frequent choice for people introducing
themselves as story tellers—a slightly unusual situation in itself, given that all the listeners nor-
mally already know who the people are. A non-verbal clause appears to be more appropriate
if one says one’s name to an unfamiliar audience. But this is hardly a steadfast rule.
ii. Pointing is expressed with non-verbal clauses only if a reactivated topic demonstrative
appears in the predicate slot, to bring back a topical participant. The context is always that
of an immediate reaction—this is it, here and now, as in T2.25 and 20.52a. In conversations the
object is pointed at with a hand.
                                                                20.1 Major constituents     52720.52a ñ@n-a                 kamna:gw k@ka
       you.fem-lk+fem.sg food            dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg
       ‘Here is your food’ (pointing) (I have just put it here; it is here right now)
An alternative would be a predicative form of a reactivated topic demonstrative, as in 20.52b.
The implication is that the food has been here for some time, and its place is here.
20.52b ñ@n-a                 kamna:gw k@ka-n-aka
       you.fem-lk+fem.sg food         dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg
       ‘Here is your food’ (pointing)
  We have already seen (20.49b) that a verbless clause may have an overtone of spontaneity. It
appears to be also the case in instances like 20.52a.
iii. Summarizing a preceding stretch of discourse can be achieved through using an adverbial
demonstrative on its own, in a verbless clause (and without a predicative marker), as in 20.53a.
An alternative is to use the word ‘manner’ in a similar structure—another verbless clause:
20.53a akatawa
       thus
       ‘This is how it is’
20.53b akatawa sa:d
       thus     way
       ‘This way (it is)’
   An alternative for each of these would be either a predicative form of adverbial demonstra-
tive (akatawa-n-a for 20.53a), or a non-verbal clause (akatawa sa:d-a for 20.53b). The verbless
versions sound more spontaneous and informal.
iv. Verbless clauses are used in a presentational function, as in T1.2.
v. Verbless clauses are used in questions (see C below) which involve manner and are marked
with the question words ata ata ‘how how’, as in 10.100, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’,
as in 10.98. Verbless clauses are also employed in questions involving naming, as in 10.102 and
20.54:
20.54 ata maway s@?
      how ﬂower name
      ‘What’s the name of the ﬂower?’
  Verbless clauses are also used in short questions used to enquire after someone: 20.55 is the
way of asking a child about his or her mother and father—that is, where they are, are they OK,
and so on:
20.55 amæy? asa:y?
      mother father
      ‘(What about) mother? Father?’
  A similar example is at 20.58—this is a question addressed to unknown beings in order to
ﬁnd out what food they would be capable of eating.
  The interrogative pronoun ak@- ‘where’ (as in Table 10.7, example 10.90) is used in non-
verbal clauses, since it requires non-verbal cross-referencing.
  If negated, verbless clauses are indistinguishable from non-verbal ones: 20.56 is a negative
version of both a non-verbal clause l@ T@k@ta:y-a (she Teketay-3fem.sgnom) ‘she is Teketay’
and a verbless clause l@ T@k@ta:y ‘she is Teketay’:
528     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices20.56 l@ T@k@ta:y ma:
      she Teketay neg
      ‘She is not Teketay’
   Table 20.1 summarizes the properties which diﬀerentiate between copula clauses, verbless
clauses, and two types of clauses with non-verbal predicates—those involving demonstratives
with the predicative marker -n- and the rest.
   The arguments in favour of considering non-verbal clauses as a separate type of clauses
headed by non-verbs are: (a) kind of cross-referencing markers used, or lack thereof; (b)
negation; (c) tense distinctions expressed with cross-referencing; (d) occurrence in subordinate
clauses and in non-indicative moods; (e) semantics; (f) use in highlighting focus constructions;
and (g) constituent order.
   Unlike copula clauses—which are similar to normal verbal clauses in all but their (lack of)
capacity to form commands—they are negated in the same, non-verbal, way, and have a strictly
subject-predicate order (see §20.2). Clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic demonstratives
in the predicate slot share more properties with verbless clauses than they do with non-verbal
clauses.
   But how do we identify grammatical relations, especially in verbless clauses? This is to be
taken up in §20.1.4.
B. Imperative clauses are always independent, and contain partially inﬂected imperative-
permissive forms discussed in §13.2. Copula clauses, clauses with non-verbal predicates, and
verbless clauses cannot occur in imperative clauses. Some verbs—such as perception verbs—
have a telic meaning when used in commands; that is, 20.57 can only mean ‘you listen’ rather
than ‘you hear’ or ‘you understand’. (A loan verb understand was used in a command urging a
child to understand what the mother was saying and to act accordingly, in 17.26b.) We return
to the ways in which ‘see’ and ‘hear’ are used in commands in §21.1.2.
   The ways in which imperatives can be negated were addressed in §14.4. An imperative
strategy can be used in lieu of an imperative-permissive form—see Table 19.5, to express
additional overtones to do with strength of the command.
   The constituent order in imperative clauses follows the same principles as that in declarative
clauses (see §20.2): it is predominantly verb ﬁnal, but a constituent can be postposed to the
verb for disambiguation or if the participant is unexpected (see T1.16).
   Imperative clauses have a rising intonation on the verb, if they imply a command, and even
if used as a turn-taking device, as in 20.57.
20.57 b@r     awuk
      you.du impv+listen
      ‘You (two) listen!’
Permissive forms (see §13.2.2), which are often used in turn taking, tend to be pronounced with
an interrogative rising intonation—see C below.
C. Interrogative clauses correspond to either polar or content questions. We mentioned in
§10.4 that content questions are marked with a question word and slightly rising intonation,
while polar questions are marked by intonation only. There is no structural diﬀerence between
a positive polar question and a corresponding statement. Only the intonation and the context
decides. Some examples are at 10.79 and further examples in §10.4, 20.14–15, the last clauses of
T1.4 and T1.18, and the ﬁrst clause of T1.14. The last clause of T2.26 contains an ‘identiﬁcation
construction’ cast as a question.

530     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices  The only instances of positive clauses with exclusively interrogative reading are short one-
noun-phrase-long questions cast as verbless clauses. These are used to enquire after someone,
as in 20.55 and 20.58 (which contains a relative clause).
20.58 [ [b@r n@b@ k@-k@-bra]                           [k@k@pa:t] ]
      you.du able eat-fut-2dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt food
      ‘(What about) food you two will be able to eat?’
   These clauses would not make sense as declarative verbless clauses, since—as we saw in A
above—verbless declarative clauses contain at least two independent NPs.
   Polar questions display the same patterns of constituent order as do declarative clauses: 13.56
is an example of an oblique, ‘with them’, placed after the verb (see §20.2). Content questions
also display the same patterns.
   A question word does not have a ﬁxed position in a clause. It tends to gravitate towards the
beginning of the clause or to appear immediately before the verb, as in 10.87–8, T1.5, T1.30,
and T3.8. The only exceptions are verbless clauses involving the question word ata ata ‘how
how’ as in 10.100–2, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’ (10.98): here the constituent order is
ﬁxed.
   The pronoun s@ ‘who?’ is unlike other interrogative words in that it takes the linker -k@- in
order to combine with case markers. It is obligatorily marked for highlighting focus if in the
subject position. And if it is used as predicate head, as in 10.82, or is marked for focus, as in
10.83, and 20.59, its form is reminiscent of a headless associative NP (as illustrated in 8.14):
it takes gender-number markers -l- ‘feminine’, -d- ‘masculine’, -bra- ‘dual’, and -di- ‘plural’,
followed by a nominal predicate cross-referencing enclitic.
20.59 s@-k@-l-al                m@n-a:k    kwatiya-l
      who-obl-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom you-lk+dat give.to.nonthird.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Who gave it to you?’
Examples like 20.59–60 can be interpreted as instances of obligatory grammaticalized focus,
not infrequent in content interrogatives worldwide. We will see, at §20.3 below, that a focused
constituent can only rarely be in the A function.
   The interrogative ‘who’ can be marked for double focus; then the nominal cross-referencing
is repeated. The meaning is highly contrastive: ‘who is it really?’ (see §20.3). In 20.60, the
speaker is wondering whether the mysterious person who had entered his house is a man or a
woman.
20.60 [s@-k@-d-ad-ad                                 k@-d@              wun-a-d@

      ‘Who is it really, you (man) (who) are staying in this house of mine? Or you (woman)
      who are staying?’
A clause may consist just of a question word, as in the last clause of T1.23. And any verbal
form, including the permissive (13.10), can occur in a question.
  When negated, both content and polar questions take the negative dependent clause marker
-ma:r- if they contain a verb—see 14.127–30. However, as we saw in §14.5.2, this is not the only
option. Many speakers (and especially young and innovative ones) use negative declarative
forms in negative questions, as in 14.131 and 14.151. If a negative question contains a non-
verbal or a verbless clause, it has the same structure as its positive counterpart:
                                                                   20.1 Major constituents         53120.61 k@                 kamna:gw vyakat ma:

      ‘Is this food not good?’  Further issues, including the patterns of response to negative questions, were discussed in
§14.5.2.","[545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558]"

                                          4.5.5 ‘Pro-sentences’Pro-sentences are a closed class of forms each of which can form a sentence on its own. The
pro-clause ay@y ‘yes’ is used as conﬁrmation of a previous statement; or to provide a positive
answer to a question. For instance, if I ask 4.82:
  8 While in the village in 2001–2, I spontaneously used two Russian interjections—br1s"", to shoo a cat, and k1S to
shoo birds. The members of Yuamali’s household liked them so much that when I came back in 2004, I was told that
the best way to get rid of a cat is to shout [m br@s""] at the top of your voice.
110     4 Word Classes4.82 gu    b@ta:y yaku-na-ñ@n?
     water already wash-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘Have you washed yet?’
the answer ay@y would mean ‘yes, I have’. If I ask 4.83:
4.83 ñ@n         s@      ma: ku?
     you.fem.sg sleep neg sleep:neg
     ‘You didn’t sleep?’
an answer ay@y would mean ‘no, I didn’t’. 9 This form can be replaced with an interjection
ah accompanied with a characteristic facial gesture consisting of a slight raise of eyebrows,
half-closed eyes, and an optional backward head tilt.
  The pro-sentence ya:k, or ya:kya (which probably consists of ya:k and the emphatic particle
ya) means ‘OK, ﬁne’ and is a marker of the end of a discourse paragraph, and a pause ﬁller.
A combination of ya:kya as direct speech report slot of the verb wa- ‘say’ and the verb ‘say’
means ‘agree; ﬁnish doing something’ (see §19.5). Speakers who frequently code-switch with
Tok Pisin or English replace ya:kya with orait.
  The two declarative negators ma: ‘non-habitual’ and ak@s ‘negative habitual’ can be used as
pro-sentences, that is, as negative answers to questions. A negative can be replaced with a facial
gesture, consisting in a side-to-side head movement. In terms of the verbal form they occur
with, each may be considered a class on its own (see §§14.1–2). The desiderative-purposive
negator ata (see §14.3) is not used as a pro-sentence.
  The greeting k@ p@ya:y is a class on its own (see §21.5.3). Syntactically, this is used only as
a greeting, that is a vocative form. It may be related to the address form k@ p, plural k@pugw,
discussed in §4.1.2 above.","[136, 137]"
"Scheme 14.2 Negation of a non-verbal predicate: an illustration
  A verb marked with a derivational suﬃx -r@b ‘fully’ (§12.8.1) can occur in a negative clause
only if accompanied by the negative form of the same root (see examples of such structures in
positive polarity in 12.42–3). An example is at 14.6. One character is trying to convince another
to cut oﬀ his wife’s breast and put it into a yam soup to make it taste better, assuring him that:14.6 [kiya-saki-ku]         [kwasa r@-ku]           [rap@-k-na]

in negative clauses.",[327]
"Scheme 11.1 The structure of a verb stem
                                      11.1.2 The structure of verbal predicateAll verbal markers occur on a verb stem. The structure of the verbal stem is in Scheme 11.1.
   The verb stem must include (ii), that is, there has to be at least one verbal root (which
can undergo reduplication: see §12.8.3). Manambu has numerous types of verb compound-
ing, covering sequences of subactions, valency changing, and aspectual meanings, such as
‘incomplete action’, ‘action to perfection’, and ‘completion’. The aspect markers which have
grammaticalized from compounded verbal roots can be reduplicated (see §15.2 for a discussion
of their meanings). This is unlike aspect markers discussed in Chapter 12.
   Positions (i) and (iii) are optional. A verbal stem can also contain one, or maximally two,
directional markers, whose form varies somewhat depending on the verb (see §16.1).
   We saw, in §3.1, that if a verb takes the action focus -na-, no constituent other than
the subject can be cross-referenced on it. The structure of a fully inﬂected verb with and
without the action focus marker is given in Scheme 11.2. Numbers of sections of Chapter
12 dealing with every speciﬁc category are in brackets. Verbal stem and subject (A/S) cross-
referencing are the only obligatory components of a fully inﬂected verb—in the sense that a
verb form could not exist without them. Others can be added if a particular meaning is to be
expressed.
   An example of a longish fully inﬂected verb is in 11.1. The verb stem here contains a
causative-manipulative preﬁx kay-, two compounded verb roots (see §15.3.2), and two direc-
tionals (§16.1.4). This is followed by the habitual, the future, the action focus marker, the non-
A/S ‘basic’ cross-referencing marker, and the conﬁrmation marker. Numbers above example
11.1 correspond to the positions in the stem structure and the verb structure:
    1. Verbal stem
    2. -kwa- ‘habitual aspect’ (§12.3)a or -tu- ‘complete involvement of S/O’ (§12.4)
    3. -k@- ‘future’ (§12.2)b        either
4a. A/S marked with the subject set of tense-sensitive cross-referencing markers (§12.1.1)

    or

   A partially inﬂected verb is much simpler. There is a basic diﬀerence between imperatives
as partially inﬂected verbal forms, and all other uninﬂected verbs. The imperative obligatorily
takes either the preﬁx a- which triggers changes in the verb stem, or a special set of imperative-
only suﬃxes (see §13.2). A second person imperative is in 11.2, and a third person imperative is
in 11.3:
11.2 atak
     impv+put
     ‘put (it down)!’
11.3 taka-kwa-d
     put-impv.3p-masc.sg
     ‘may he put (it down)!’
A non-imperative partially inﬂected verb has just three positions, as shown in Scheme 11.3. All
of these are obligatory, if the given meaning is to be expressed.
  An example is under 11.4:
     1     1 311.4 taka-tu-k@k
     put-1sg-purp.ds
     ‘so that I put (it down)’
   Non-tensed and tense-sensitive subject cross-referencing markers are listed in Table 11.2
(repeated from Table 3.2). They are in part identical. The main diﬀerence lies in the absence
of ﬁnal vowel in ﬁrst and second person singular non-tensed forms. In dual and plural, the
non-tensed cross-referencing markers are identical with those denoting remote past tense.
   The structure of an uninﬂected verb is straightforward: a suﬃx marking a category of an
uninﬂected verb attaches directly to the stem. In 11.5, the desiderative suﬃx -k@r attaches to a
verbal stem with positions (i) and (ii) ﬁlled:
11.5 [kay-kwa-taka]stem -k@r
     manip-stay-put-des
     ‘(I/you/(s)he/we/they want to pour’
  The negative declarative non-habitual stands apart from other verb forms in the language.
For some verbs it coincides with the verb’s root, e.g. k@- ‘eat’, ma: k@ (neg eat+neg) ‘do(es) not

eat’. For other verbs, it is marked with root alternation, e.g. wa- ‘say’, ma: w@ (neg say+neg)
‘do(es) not say’ (see §11.3). The corresponding negative future coincides with the verb root, e.g.
k@ ma: ‘will not eat’, wa ma: ‘will not say’. (But note that the negator is placed after the verb
root—see §14.1.1.)
   Uninﬂected verbs used in main clauses—with the exception of the negatives and the
prohibitives—require a support verb if they head the predicate of a non-main clause, or
if additional tense, aspect, or mood/modality speciﬁcations are to be provided. Such forms
include completive aspect (§12.6), customary aspect (§12.7), same-subject purposive (§13.4.1),
desiderative (§13.5), frustrative (§13.6), and also verbs marked with suﬃxes -r@b ‘fully’ and
-d@ka ‘only’ (§9.2; §12.8.1).The support is normally t@- ‘be, have, stand’. The only exception
is the completive aspect which requires na- ‘copula for abstract states’. This is a feature
uninﬂected verbs share with nominals, and with deverbal nominalizations (see §9.1.1, and
§17.2.1). Reduplicated verbs and forms of the customary aspect (see 4.47–8, and §12.7, §12.8.2)
can be used either as inﬂected or as uninﬂected verbs.
   Manambu presents a clear example of dependencies between various grammatical cate-
gories. Gender, number, and person distinctions are neutralized in negative declarative and
prohibitive clauses; so are all aspect and modality meanings—just as predicted by Aikhenvald
and Dixon (1998). All the modalities, aspects, and tenses are distinguished in positive declara-
tive main clauses.
   Habitual forms behave diﬀerently from non-habitual ones: when they are negated, there
is no neutralization of person, number, and gender. And there is no habitual imperative—
the habitual meaning (and marking) does not occur in commands. Along similar lines, a verb
marked with the suﬃx -tu- ‘complete involvement of S/O’ does not occur in imperatives, or in
any uninﬂected verbs. In contrast to the habitual, a verb marked with -tu- cannot be negated.
   No aspect or modality categories can be marked in imperative clauses—this is typologi-
cally quite common. Non-indicative moods and modalities, and aspectual meanings—such as
habitual, customary, or completive—are mutually exclusive. This may reﬂect the fact that the
choice of aspect depends on mood, and on modality. This type of dependency requires further
investigation.
                                                          11.2 Non-verbal predicate heads     249  We will see in §14.5 and in Chapter 18 that relative clauses and juxtaposed sequencing clauses
can be distinguished from main clauses only by the ways in which they are negated. That
more formal distinctions in clause types are made in negative than in positive polarity appears
to contradict the general spirit of dependencies between grammatical systems. In addition,
Manambu has one imperative construction, and three ways of marking prohibitive. These
features are typologically unusual.
            11.2 t h e s t ru c t u r e o f no n-v e r ba l p r e d i c at e h e a d sNon-verbal predicate heads are simpler in structure than verbs: they can only take nominal
cross-referencing enclitics (listed in Table 3.4), and the conﬁrmation marker. This is shown in
Scheme 11.4.
   Non-verbal predicate heads include nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and members of most closed
classes. In addition, there are a few special cases.
   First, reactivated topic demonstratives, and manner demonstratives and interrogatives
(§10.2.2, §10.2.3, and §10.4), take the predicative marker -n, and do not occur with any person
markers. Of these, only manner demonstratives can take the conﬁrmation marker, e.g. 11.6:11.6 ak@tawa-n-@k
     like.this-pred-conf
     ‘It is really like this (as far as the speaker is concerned)’   And secondly, we can recall, from §10.2.3, that reactivated topic demonstratives contain a
predicate marker -n- when focused or when used as predicate heads. Again, no person enclitics
can be used.
   When an agreeing adjective (‘small’ or ‘big’—see §4.3.1) or any other agreeing modiﬁers
from closed classes occur in the predicate slot, they also take subject agreement marking. This
results in what can be seen as redundant double agreement in gender with the same constituent,
as shown in 11.7:11.7 numa-d-ad@wun
     big-masc.sg-1masc.sgnom
     ‘I (man) am big’  The agreeing adjective yara ‘ﬁne’ is not used as a predicate head. Further examples of non-
verbal predicates are in 3.12–13; also see T3.8 (‘I am Oselo’).
  Just like a fully inﬂected verb, a non-verbal predicate can be within the scope of highlighting
focus. Then, the non-verbal predicate head is marked—for the second time—with non-verbal
person markers. An example is under 11.8. Square brackets mark the boundaries of a clause
with a non-verbal predicate as its head, ‘it is a man’. Curly brackets indicate that the clause is
within the scope of highlighting focus—see §20.3.","[273, 274, 275, 276]"
"
 14.1.3 Contiguity in non-future negative constructions, and the scope of negationIn future negative constructions, the verb and the negator are always contiguous, and form one
phonological word. In non-future negative constructions, contiguity is not required. Then the
order of the negator and the verb cannot be reversed: the negator has to precede the negative
verb.
  The only form which obligatorily intervenes between the negator and the negated verb is the
adverb n@bay ‘yet, already’, as in 14.20. Any other order is ungrammatical (see 14.20a).
14.20 d@ ma: n@bay yæy
      he neg yet     come.neg
      ‘He has not come yet’
14.20a?? ∗ d@ n@bay ma: yæy
         he yet     neg come.neg
         ‘He has not come yet’—???
  The following types of constituents may intervene between the negator and the negative verb
form. The eﬀect is focusing on the intervening constituent. As mentioned in §20.3, individual
constituents hardly ever occur in highlighting focus in negative constructions. Changing their
position in a clause is one way of focusing them.
1. The adjective yara ‘well, ﬁne’ used adverbially can intervene between the negator and the
negated verb, as in 14.21a where ‘well’ is in focus.
14.21a wun ma: yara la:kw
       I     neg well know.neg
       ‘I do not know (this) well (contrary to what you may expect)’
304     14 Negation  In 14.21b, ‘well’ is not in focus:
14.21b wun yara ma: la:kw
       I     well neg know.neg
       ‘I do not know (this) well’2. The object can intervene between the negator and the negated verb, as in 14.22–3, with the
object in highlighting focus:
14.22 man-ta:b ma: ap             t@
      foot-hand neg bone/force have.neg
      ‘(His) hands and feet had no strength’
14.23 k@ta wun ma: br@-k@-m          wuk@mar
      now I     neg 3du-obl-acc forget.neg
      ‘Now I haven’t forgotten these two (white people) (despite the fact that we lost touch)’
3. The copula complement can intervene between the negator and the negated verb. In 14.24,
the narrator stresses that people and apawul spirits are not friendly because of a number of
misunderstandings—in contrast, they fear each other:
14.24 al@k        ñan-awa       ma: kapawi t@
      this.is.why we-lk+com neg friend be.neg
      ‘This is why (they) are not friends with us (they are scared of us)
4. The subject can intervene between the negator and the verb. An example of the A of t@-
‘have’ is at 14.25—this is what a speaker said about her siblings:
14.25 takwa-d@ka        du-a-ma:gw       ma: ñan t@
      woman+lk-only man-lk-’thing’ neg we have.neg
      ‘(We are) just women, we (in contrast to others) do not have brothers’
  In 14.26, gu ‘water’, in the S function, intervenes between the negator and the verb:
14.26 ma: gu     r@
      neg water sit.neg
      ‘There was no water (in contrast to what was expected)’
5. An oblique in a locative, or an allative case, can intervene between the negator and the verb,
as in 14.27–8, and T3.14:
14.27 [yæj         k@-na-wur               t@n@b-a:m          r@-na]
      frying.pan dem.prox-curr.rel-up ﬁreplace-lk+loc sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [ma: wiya:m             r@]
      neg house+lk+loc sit.neg
      ‘The frying pan is up there (in previously mentioned location) on the ﬁreplace, it was
      sitting in the house (contrary to what the character expected)’
14.28 ma: ña:r           krakw
      neg sun+lk+all take+outside
      ‘(The two brothers) did not take (their new sister) out into the sun’ (contrary to what
      would be expected)
6. A part of complex predicate marked with the sequential -n (see §17.1.1 and §16.2.3) can
intervene between the negator and a posture verb, as a means of focusing on the lexical verb:
                                                  14.1 Declarative non-habitual clauses       30514.29 ñan [Malu kwa-na                          nagw@m]         ma: væn       r@
      we Malu stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt sago+lk+acc neg see+seq sit+neg
      ‘We did not sit watching the sago that was staying at the Malu village’
   Examples like 14.21–9 are common to all generations of speakers of all levels of proﬁciency.
In most such cases, the intervening word does not exceed two syllables. An exception is at
14.24—but note that it comes from a story by an elderly man who was trying his best to be as
elaborate as possible.
   Only highly elaborate speakers allow a whole clause to intervene between the negator and
the verb. Examples are at 14.30 and 14.31.
14.30 a-d@               a:s ma: [ya:n        br@-k@-k      ma:k] ta:k
      dem.dist-masc.sg dog neg come+seq 3du-obl-dat face put.neg
      ‘That dog did not show his face by coming to them two’ (contrary to what they expected)
  In 14.31, two constituents intervene between the negator and the negated verb—the adverb
n@bay (for which this is the only possible position) is placed close to the negator, and followed
by a dependent clause ‘like I stay’. The spirit of a dead woman refuses to give her living husband
the food she eats in the world of the dead:
14.31 m@n-a:k            k@-di         kami: a-di        kwa:y kwatiya              ma:,
      2masc.sg-lk+dat dem.prox-pl ﬁsh dem.dist-pl shrimp give.to.nonthird.p neg
      m@n        [ma: n@bay [wun kwa-tua-p@k]                          ku]
      you.masc neg yet        I     stay-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-like stay.neg
      ‘I won’t give you these ﬁsh, those shrimp, you are not yet in the same state as I am
      (contrary to what you may think)’
   There is an intonation break between ma: n@bay ‘not yet’ and the rest. This is not surprising:
ma: n@bay behaves like a ﬁxed expression.
   If a multiword complex predicate consists of an inﬂected auxiliary and an uninﬂected part
(see Chapter 17), the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate intervenes between the negator
and the inﬂected part. This is shown in 14.32.
14.32 d@ væy ma: warya-n            t@
      he spear neg quarrel/ﬁght-seq have+neg
      ‘He hadn’t fought with spear’
   To focus the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate, this has to be preposed to the negator.
Note that the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate cannot follow the negative form of the
auxiliary—this is in contrast to uninﬂected verbs which are not part of complex predicates
(§17.1–2). In 14.33, the speaker focuses on the fact that she had never ever seen European-type
long hair (she had heard of this, but this was her ﬁrst-time visual experience):
14.33 wun tala:b væ-n ma: t@                 nab [ñ@n-a
      I     before see-seq neg have.neg hair you.fem-3fem.sgnom
      t@-na-p@k]
      have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt-like
      ‘I have never before seen hair like you have’
  Complex predicates consisting of a nominal and a verb are negated just like other complex
predicates in 14.32: the whole complex predicate follows the negator, as in 14.34–5:
306     14 Negation14.34 wun ma: s@kul@k y@
      I     neg cooking do/go
      ‘I didn’t do the cooking’
14.35 wun k@            t@pa:m              ma: j@b@ kwa:r
      I     dem.prox village+lk+loc neg image do/get+neg
      ‘I didn’t learn to write (lit. get image) in this village’
   The position of negator and the eﬀect of reversing the order of the nominal, or the
dependent-marked verb, and the negated verb help diﬀerentiate superﬁcially similar complex
verbs containing auxiliaries (as in 14.33–5) and sequencing structures (as in 14.29).
   In none of the examples discussed above does the change in the position of the negator
aﬀect the scope: the negator consistently has the whole clause within its scope. There is just
one exception. The adverb m@yir appears to be unique in that the scope of negation diﬀers
depending on its position in a clause. In 14.36, m@yir ‘really’ precedes the negator, and the verb
is within the scope of negation.
14.36 a-di        ma:j n@k@-di du-ta:kw         m@yir ma: la:kw
      dem.dist-pl story other-pl man-woman really neg know.neg
      ‘Other people really do not know those stories’
  In 14.37, this same adverb intervenes between the negator and the verb. Either the verb or
the adverb can be understood as being within the negator’s scope. The ambiguity is resolved
by context.
14.37 a-di          ma:j n@k@-di du-ta:kw     ma: m@yir la:kw
      dem.dist-pl story other-pl man-woman neg really know.neg
      ‘Other people do not really know those stories’ or ‘Other people really do not know
      those stories’
  Manambu has no negative pronouns. The numeral ‘one’ in its indeﬁnite meaning is used in
negative clauses, meaning ‘not one’, as in 12.7 (nak-a:b@ ma: y@ (one-too neg go) ‘not one
escapes’), and T3.14 where the form nakam@y ‘single one (feminine)’ is used.
  If a constituent other than the predicate is to be negated, it has to form an independent non-
verbal clause negated by ma:. To say ‘not only in Avatip’ one literally says ‘only in Avatip—no’,
as in 14.38. The non-verbal negative clause is in square brackets.
14.38 n@b@l wun-a-d@        t@p-a:m        Apat@p-a:m         [wun-a-d@        t@p-a-d@ka

      ‘Now in my village, Avatip, not only in my village, (lit. only in my village—no), in our
      three or four Manambu villages, there are two roads by which we keep going round’
  A negative non-verbal clause can occupy the same position as a noun phrase. For instance,
the word for ‘bald’ is nab ma: t@- (hair neg have). How this term was used is shown in 14.39
(an example of the argument elaboration construction: §6.2.3). That ma: ‘negator’ forms one
constituent with nab ‘hair’ and not with the verb t@- ‘have’ is evident from the form of the
                                                      14.2 Negation of habitual clauses       307verb: it is inﬂected as a positive, and not as a negative verb. A negative form of t@- is shown
in 14.40—this sentence was used to describe a girl who is not bald, but whose hair had been
shaved because of lice. (Constituency is indicated with square brackets.)
14.39 [an    Bob wuk@n] [nab ma:] t@-na-bran
      we.two Bob together hair neg have-act.foc-1dubas.vt
      ‘We two, Bob and I, are bald’ (lit. we have there-is-no hair)
14.40 nab [ma: t@]
      hair neg have.neg
      ‘She has no hair’
  Negating one constituent as a separate non-verbal clause produces the eﬀect of strong
contrast. One sister is saying to the other: ‘We two will eat that sago with coconut’, and the
younger sister replies 14.41:
14.41 ka!                    t@p-a:wa           ma:, bal-awa
      dem.prox+3fem.sgnom coconut-lk+com neg pig-lk+com
      k@-k@-ta
      eat-fut-1dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘ “That? (meaning: no way!), not with coconut, we will eat (sago) with pork!” ’
   A similar example is at 10.145 (‘few, not many, few people went down (river)’).
   As we will see in §14.6, the negator ma:—unlike any other negator—can be used as a
complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ with the meaning of ‘forbid, negate, refuse’. This is illustrated
in 9.5, 13.78, and 14.42. In such constructions the verb wa- remains inﬂected as required. The
second occurrence of ‘say no’ is negated in the last line of 14.42.
14.42 alaku                          [ma: wa-k-na-b@r],               wun-a:k
      dem.dist+fem.sg+outwards neg say-fut-act.foc-3dubas.vt I-lk+dat
      jama-jama-k       ma: awakw          b@r      [ [ma:] wa]     ma:!
      get.ﬁre-red-dat no, impv+go.out they.two neg say.neg neg
      ‘ “Across there they will refuse (say no) to me getting ﬁre.” “No, go out, they won’t
      refuse” ’
 This example also illustrates another usage of ma:—that of a general negative pro-clause.
We return to this in §14.6. Inherently negative lexemes (see §14.6) co-occur with clausal negator
ma:. They do not have the same scope eﬀects as does ma:. Neither do other negators.
                        14.2 ne gat i o n o f h a b i t ua l c lau s e sHabitual clauses (which require the verb in habitual aspect marked with the suﬃx -kwa-
‘present’, -yikwa- ‘past’: see §12.3) are negated with the negator ak@s which occurs with the
verb in habitual aspect (marked with the suﬃx -kwa-). Unlike the general negator, ak@s co-
occurs with fully inﬂected verbs, as in 14.43–4, 10.5, and 10.60. The negative habitual refers to
what is typically not done.
14.43 ñ@n      ak@s       k@-kus@-kwa-na-ñ@n
      you.fem neg.hab eat-ﬁnish-hab-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘You never eat (things) up’
308     14 NegationThe copula t@- is obligatorily used to express a habitual non-occurrence involving a non-verbal
predicate head:
14.44 yabi:b ak@s      kuprap t@-kwa-na-di
      quickly neg.hab bad      stay-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘They do not become bad quickly’
  We can recall, from §4.2.2, that the verb kui- ‘give to third person’ is quite unusual in that it
has two alternative forms of the negative habitual. Unlike other verbs in the language, it does
not have to take the suﬃx -yikwa- ‘past habitual’ in the past negative form. Two options are
thus available for ‘give’ in past habitual; there is no semantic diﬀerence between the two. The
regular form, kui-kwa- ‘(not) give habitually’, is shown in 4.37 and 14.45:
14.45 ak@s     kui-yikwa-l                           d@-k@        ta:kw
      neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab.past-3fem.sgbas.p he-obl+fem.sg wife
      ‘She never used to give (them food), his wife’
   The alternative non-habitual declarative form, kui-, with the habitual negator ak@s, is shown
in 4.38 and 14.46. Within the same story, 14.45 and 14.46 follow each other.
14.46 ñaj             ta:kw kuprap-al          ak@s       kui-d
      paternal.uncle wife bad-3fem.sgnom neg.hab give.to.third.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Paternal uncle’s wife was bad, she never gave (children food)’
   A negative construction containing the negator ak@s and an inﬂected verb forms two gram-
matical and two phonological words. A habitual negative construction with ak@s does not have
to be contiguous. In 9.21 the copula complement precedes the construction of ak@s followed
by an inﬂected verb, and in 14.44 the copula complement is positioned between the negator
and the inﬂected verb. The eﬀect of inserting a constituent between ak@s and the inﬂected
verb is essentially the same as that in constructions with the non-future negative structures
involving the declarative non-habitual negator ma: (see §14.1.3 above): the inserted constituent
is in highlighting focus.
   In fact, any constituent, except for subject or object, can intervene between ak@s and the
inﬂected verb. In 14.47 gus ‘paddle’ is part of a complex predicate involving a typical instrument
(see §7.2).
14.47 wun ak@s        gus  ka-kwa-na-wun
      I     neg.hab paddle paddle/row-hab-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I never paddle’
In 14.48, a series of dependent clauses intervenes between the negator and the inﬂected verb:
these clauses contain information which is contrary to what is expected of the river-dwellers:
14.48 aday                      a                 yabwiyim

      ‘This is why being afraid of the white-breasted eagle over there sitting on that soft wood
      tree we never get ﬁsh and eat it, never wash going out to the lake and carrying (things)’
                                              14.3 Negation of non-indicative modalities         309   In contrast to ma: ‘declarative non-habitual negator’, the habitual negator ak@s does not
occur with n@bay ‘yet’. An anterior complex predicate involving the habitual form copula t@-
and a sequential form of a verb is preceded by ak@s as shown in 14.49 (a non-habitual negated
anterior complex predicate is at 14.32). Any alternative ordering of ak@s and the inﬂected verb
in such structures appears contrived.
14.49 antibiotic ak@s      kur-@n      t@-kwa-na-wun
      antibiotic neg.hab do/get-seq have-hab-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
      ‘I have never been taking antibiotics’
   The negators ma: and ak@s share some similarities in terms of contiguity in negative con-
structions; but are not identical in their properties. Unlike ma:, the negator ak@s is not used
to negate non-verbs on their own—that is, without a copula (see 14.44). Consequently, it is
not used to negate a nominal constituent in the way ma: is employed (see 14.41). Neither is it
used as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’. The negator ak@s can be used elliptically, meaning
‘never’: in its second occurrence in 14.50, ‘never’ is an elliptic clause recapitulating the previous
clause:
14.50 [l@ ñan-a-k@               kwa:s ak@s     yak@-sada-kwa-na-b@r]
      she we-lk-poss+fem.sg salt neg.hab throw-down-hab-act.foc-3dubas.vt
      [ak@s], [sama:b ak@s         yak@-sada-kwa-na-b@r]
      neg.hab no.way neg.hab throw-down-hab-act.foc-3dubas.vt
      ‘This salt of ours they would never throw (into their food), never, never ever would they
      throw (salt in their food)’
   The general non-habitual negator ma: and the habitual negator ak@s are both used as pro-
clauses in elliptical replies—see 14.51 and 14.42.
14.51 ñ@n      yaki k@-kwa-na-ñ@n?                ak@s
      you.fem smoke eat-hab-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt neg.hab
      ‘ “Do you usually smoke?” “Never!” ’
  Further similarities and diﬀerences between ma: and ak@s are addressed in §14.6.
  The same negator, ak@s, is used to negate irrealis in main clauses, and in counterfactual
conditional clauses, and to negate the optative mood—this is the topic of the next section.
                 14.3 ne gat i o n o f n o n- i n d i c at i v e m o da l i t i e sAll of the non-indicative modalities discussed in Chapter 13 can be negated, with the exception
of the frustrative. Irrealis and optative, on the one hand, and same-subject purposive and
desiderative, on the other, are negated in the same way (§§14.3.1–2). Diﬀerent-subject purposive
is negated in the same way as any verbal predicate in a non-main clause—see §14.3.2 and §14.5.
The negation of nominalizations as predicate heads is addressed in §14.3.3.","[330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"
"
                                14.5.2 Negating questionsNegation of questions, content and polar, follows essentially the same pattern as that of
dependent clauses: the verb is marked with the dependent negation -ma:r-. As expected, a non-
verbal predicate has to be used as a copula complement of t@- which is then negated with -ma:r-
in order to be able to occur in negative questions. Just as with any instances of the dependent
negator -ma:r-, the marker usually goes onto a non-future negative stem (see §11.3.2), as shown
in 14.130. However, this is only a tendency (cf. 14.133).
   The diﬀerence between negated questions and negated dependent clauses lies in the presence
of interrogative morphemes in content questions (see §10.4) and also in the intonation contour.
Questions have a rising intonation, while dependent clauses have intonation contours of their
own (we return to these in Chapter 20).
   In 14.127, a negative content question is followed by a positive one. Other examples of a
negated content question are at 14.128, and 10.107 (‘How come you didn’t see her?’).
14.127 [agwa jap@k           yi-ma:r-na-d],                         k@-d@

       what+dat marry-neg.sub-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
       ‘For what reason didn’t he marry her?’
  Polar questions are negated in the same way, as shown in 14.129–30.
14.129 ka                                  am@y kwa:y

       kwa-ma:r-na?
       stay-neg.sub-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Are there no shrimp in this very basket?’
  In 14.130, a negative polar question contains a negated dependent clause. The two are
negated in the same way.
14.130 [al-ay                ta:kw væn         ku-ma:r-@n]           a-di          a:s

       ‘As that woman far away was staying without looking, you did not look after the dogs
       properly?’
330     14 Negation  However, there are two additional ways of asking a negative polar question. First, many
speakers, in particular young and innovative ones, use negative declarative forms, as in 14.131.
A similar example is at 14.151 below.14.131 l@ du-a:k          ma: r@?
       she man-lk+dat neg sit.neg
       ‘She didn’t get married, did she?’  And secondly, a desubordinated dependent clause can be used as a polar question. Such
questions frequently have overtones of counterexpectation. At the name debating ceremony
(held on 8 October 2004) I was allowed to sit with the men, record, and take pictures.
Dameliway was keeping an eye on me from the women’s quarters; she was worried that I could
have lost my stringbag, and, at ﬁrst opportunity, rushed to me with a worried question:14.132 ñ@n      kwasabi ku-su-ma:r-@n?
       you.fem stringbag put-up-neg.sub-seq
       ‘How is it that you are not wearing a stringbag (as I expected you would because you
       always do)?’  The speaker who said 14.133 was surprised that there was water left in the bucket:14.133 aw gu       ata         kus@-ma:r-ku?
       then water thus/then ﬁnish-neg.sub-compl.ss
       ‘Then the water is not ﬁnished (or you haven’t ﬁnished the water)?’   Only some same-subject and non-switch-reference-sensitive sequencing clauses undergo
desubordination. We return to this in §19.9. Positive desubordinated clauses are often used
in commands, and in statements, rather than in questions.
   That there is a formal connection between questions and dependent clauses comes as no
surprise to a typologist. It is well known that in many languages questions, both negative and
positive, involve clefts with the surface structure of dependent clauses. That this connection in
Manambu reveals itself only under negation is unusual.","[356, 357]"

                                14.3.3 Negation of nominalizationsDeverbal nominalizations which consist of a reduplicated verbal root are negated like any
non-verb, with a postposed negator ma:. However, as shown in §9.1.1 (see (VI) ), negated
nominalizations most often imply negative obligation, or a taboo, as in 9.19, 13.19, 14.74, and
14.97.
   1 Farnsworth and Farnsworth (1966) suggest that the negation of d@ yi-k@r (he come-des) ‘he wants to come’ is
d@ kwas@k yi-na-d (he small+dat come-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘he does not want to come’. However, these are
clearly diﬀerent construction types, and the structure with kwas@k is simply a lexical expression of ‘not wanting to
do something’.
                                              14.3 Negation of non-indicative modalities     31514.74 Apat@p-a-wa warya-k            k@-d@               bæyib-@r         [war-war ma:]

      ‘There is a prohibition against going up this stream to ﬁght with the Avatip people’
  Negated nominalizations can be used in lieu of negative commands, and as a means of
berating someone who has done something they should not have done, as in 9.20 and 14.75:
14.75 atawa kur-kur ma:
      thus do-red neg
      ‘You shouldn’t have acted like this’ (lit. there is no doing that way)
  A negated nominalization may also be used to straightforwardly negate an action no matter
whether good or bad. This is shown in 14.76, a description of what happened to a Gala man
who had survived the attack of the Avatip people, and hid in a hollow of a sago tree (the
continuation of this is 14.22). He was so weak that:
14.76 yi:n    b@        ya     m@l kuprap man-ta:b b@            kap        [yi-y@ ma:]
      go+seq already emph eye bad           leg-hand already on.its.own go-red neg
      ‘By and by (his) eye (became) bad, (with) his body (lit. legs and hands), he already could
      not walk on his own’ (lit. there was no walking on his own)
   A similar example is the ﬁrst clause of 14.73—the speaker was complaining that there is no
sleeping while children are making noise, not that one should not sleep when there is noise.
   The meaning of a nominalization under negation is determined entirely by the context. The
meaning of ‘negative obligation’ is the most frequent one. And this is the reason why the
negation of nominalizations is considered within this section. However, this reading makes
little sense in a context like that in 14.76—then the meaning is ‘lack of action’.
   And, as we saw in §9.1.1 (at VI), an additional problem may arise. The negative form of
the reduplicated intensive aspect of a verb may coincide with the reduplicated verb stem,
that is, a nominalization. In negative future, the negator is postposed to the negative form
of an inﬂected verb, making constructions like 9.20 and T1.15 inherently ambiguous between
(a) negated nominalization as a means of negative obligation; and (b) negative future of the
intensive aspect. Just as in 9.20, both readings make sense in the given context of a comic story
about a newly wed young man who had no idea that women menstruate, literally, ‘see moon’,
once a month. He decides to stop the moon from seeing his wife by going and ﬁghting her (cf.
3.15 and 7.76). T1.15 is what his relatives tell him: it is your own moon, and there is no point
in ﬁghting her.
   However, such negative constructions are only ambiguous if the subject is second person
(the addressee), or a generic ‘one’, or a third person. Example 14.77 is not ambiguous—this
can only refer to the future. As shown in §12.2, future often has the meaning of ‘being able to’.
In this example, the man is not refusing to pay the bride price, he has no means of paying it.
The story from which 14.77 comes was told by a traditional speaker, and this explains the use
of negator ma:n; the form ma: would have been equally acceptable:
14.77 wun-a-d@ka [yapi-yapi ma:n]
      I-lk-only buy-red neg
      ‘I by myself won’t pay the bride price’ (lit. ‘buy (wife)’)
   A potential ambiguity in the context of non-ﬁrst person may be resolved by context: in the
ﬁrst clause of 14.73 the negated reduplicated verb cannot have a future intensive meaning,
because there is no future reference: the speaker was complaining about what was happening
in the house in general and the night before in particular.
316      14 Negation  Deverbal nominalizations marked with the dative-aversive case whose modal meanings are
discussed in §13.7 are negated just like any other nominalizations, or non-verbal predicate
heads, by postposing the general negator ma:. This is shown in 14.78–9:
14.78 wun k@-l@-m                  [kwa-kwak       ma:]
      I     dem.prox-fem.sg-loc stay-red+dat neg
      ‘I am not going to stay here; there is no probability that I will stay here’
14.79 du-ta:kw      d@y-a:m         [v@-væk          ma:]
      man-woman they-lk+loc see-red+dat neg
      ‘People are not to see them’ (spirits) (since the spirits live in a totemic haze after a conﬂict
      with people)
  Example 14.80 is a conﬁrmation question: the mother wanted to make sure her baby
daughter was not interested in eating any more food:
14.80 ñ@n      [k@-ka:k      ma:]?
      you.fem eat-red+dat neg
      ‘You are not going to eat, are you?’
  Monosyllabic verbs have homonymous forms for dative-aversive-marked nominalizations
and same-subject purposive—this is discussed in §13.7. The two are negated diﬀerently: a
nominalization is negated as in 14.80, and the same-subject purposive is negated with the
marker ata (as shown in §14.3.2).
  Negated dative-aversive nominalizations can be used in an admonitive sense, as in 14.81–2.
This is quite unlike the negated nominalizations illustrated in 14.74–5.
14.81 kamna:gw æm s@-sa:k             ma:
      food       share plant-red+dat neg
      ‘Why don’t you share food among yourselves, you ought to share food’
  A similar construction can be used ironically:
14.82 kad                        kiya-kiya:k ma:
      dem.prox+3masc.sgnom die-red+dat neg
      ‘This one, he is not going to die’ (said about a selﬁsh man who knows how to look after
      himself)
   Instances of modal uses for the dative-aversive nominalizations (see 13.74–86) can be negated
in a somewhat diﬀerent way: the negator ma: is postposed to the nominalization but there is
a pause which indicates that ma: is a negative pro-clause negating the clause as a whole. A
dative-aversive nominalization in the apprehensive sense of ‘lest’ (13.86) is likely to be negated:
14.83 kiya-kiya-k [pause] ma:
      die-red-dat          neg
      ‘Beware lest you die—no (you won’t die)’ (there is nothing to fear)
   This is similar to how any clause can be negated; the meaning is that of an emphatic
statement or command (see 14.152–4 in §14.6 below). We return to further functions of the
pro-clause ma: in §14.6.
   As mentioned in §13.7, the predicate of the conditional ‘in case’ clause looks exactly like a
dative-aversive-marked nominalization. But, being a part of a non-main clause, it is negated
diﬀerently. This is the topic of §14.5.1.
                                                               14.4 Negative imperative        317                               14.4 ne gat i v e i m p e rat i v eManambu has several negative imperatives (or prohibitives) whose use correlates with person,
and with the strength of a prohibition. There is no ﬁrst person prohibitive—in other words,
there is no negative equivalent of ﬁrst person imperative (§13.2). The negative imperatives fall
into two broad classes: (i) non-ﬁrst person negative imperatives which can refer to second or
third person (§14.4.1) and (ii) speciﬁcally third person negative imperatives (§14.4.2). We discuss
these one at a time. Unlike negative non-future forms, the formation of negative imperatives
always involves simple (that is, positive) verb stem (§11.1.2).","[341, 342, 343, 344]"
"                           14.4.2 Third person negative imperativesManambu has two speciﬁcally third person negative imperatives. One of these is well estab-
lished in the language, and the other appears to be a recent innovation. Unlike the negative
imperatives discussed in §14.4.1, which may be addressed to either second or third person
but bear no gender or number markers, the third person negative imperatives cross-reference
gender and number of the third person.
   The third person imperative used by all generations is marked with the suﬃx -ba which
follows the third person personal cross-referencing markers, e.g. ya-d@-ba (come-3masc.sg-
3pproh) ‘he should not come’; ya-b@r-ba (come-3du-3pproh) ‘they two should not come’; ya-
da-ba (come-3pl-3pproh) ‘they should not come’. Its meaning is that of strong prohibition and
negative obligation directed at third person. The referent of third person is always human, just
as with the strong prohibitives discussed in §14.4.1. In its illocutionary force it is comparable
to the extra-strong prohibitive -wayik, with an additional overtone of negative obligation. This
is illustrated in 14.102–3.
                                                                14.4 Negative imperative        32314.102 yabi:b kamna:gw k@-l@-ba                     ta:y marasin k@-ku           kamna:gw

       Ambunti+loc stay+seq work do-3pl-3pproh
       ‘While in Ambunti they should not work’
   Unlike any other command, negative or positive, a third person negative imperative can
occur marked as highlighting focus. A girl strongly prohibits her paternal uncle and his children
from coming into the house, since they had mistreated herself and her brother when they were
little. Her statement contrasts with what her brother has to say.
14.104 [k@                wun-a           wiya:r-ab            war ma:] [du nak-ab

       side+lk-house+lk+all-too go-3masc.sg-3pproh-3fem.sgnom
       ‘He is not going to go up to this house of mine, it is the case that not even one man is
       to come up (into the house). It is the case that he must not go to this side of the house
       close to you’ (said the girl to her brother)
  An alternative form of the -ba- third person negative imperative contains an additional sylla-
ble -k@- between the person-gender-number marker and the suﬃx -ba-. An example is in 14.105:
the bush baby (referred to in 14.94) is not to take oﬀ his grass skirt, under any circumstances.
The negative imperative is in highlighting focus: what he is not to do is contrasted to what
other boys do—that is, wash naked.
14.105 [kwa:r       rali:n       da:n          gu     yaku-d@-k@-ba-l]

       grass.skirt+lk-com wash-impv.3p-masc.sg
       ‘It is the case that he is not to wash having untied the grass skirt, he should wash with
       grass skirt (on)’
   The two alternatives, with and without -k@-, appear to be identical in meaning and use. The
absence of -k@- in forms quoted in 14.102–4 can be explained as a result of intervocalic -k-
lenition (see A3 in §2.6). The only problem with this explanation is that in all clear cases of
intervocalic -k- lenition, k is invariably supplied in careful speech register. In contrast, the two
alternative forms of the third person negative imperative occur in all speech registers. The third
person negative imperative is rare in discourse. Young and innovative speakers know the forms,
but hardly ever use them.
   What they use instead is an innovative third person imperative construction consisting of the
verb stem followed by the dependent clause negator -ma:r- and then by third person imperative
markers (listed in Table 13.1). Such commands do not have a strong overtone of negative
obligation—their meaning is that of a negative command to third person. A mother told her
eldest daughter not to let a younger daughter wear dirty trousers to church:
324      14 Negation14.106 kusu-ma:r-kwa
       wear-neg.sub-impv.3p+fem.sg
       ‘May she not wear (this)’
  A wish that an unwanted guest should not come was spontaneously phrased as:
14.107 ya-ma:r-kwa-d
       come-neg.sub-impv.3p-masc.sg
       ‘May he not come!’
  Such forms can also be used to express indirect causation, as in 14.108. This was said as an
explanation of why I had to use a hairclip:
14.108 l@-k@             nab kay-gwaj-@n          t@-na-d
       she-obl+fem.sg hair manip-wrap-seq stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
       væker-ma:r-kwa-d
       fall-neg.sub-impv.3p-masc.sg
       ‘It (hairclip) wraps her hair, so that (the hair) should not fall down’
   These forms are used in everyday speech by speakers of all ages—but they are condemned
by some speakers, especially those puristically oriented, as ‘non-existent’ and ‘wrong’. Given
that older and traditional speakers consider them wrong, I hypothesize that they constitute a
recent innovation. We will see, in §14.5.3 below, that the subordinate negator -ma:r- can be used
in main declarative clauses if they refer to a wish, or if the clause is in focus. The meaning of
‘wish’ is consistent with the third person command; and it is likely that third person imperative
markers were added to the -ma:r- form by analogy.
   One cannot exclude, however, that this seemingly innovative negative imperative is in fact an
archaic form. We will also see, at the end of §14.5, that the negator -mar-ék marks negative
commands in Wosera (Wilson 1980: 164–5). If the markers in Manambu and Wosera are
related, the negative imperative use of Manambu -ma:r- may be a retention rather than an
innovation.
         14.5 ne gat i o n o f d e p e n d e n t c laus e s, q u e s t i o n s,
                             a n d f o c u s s t ru c t u r e sDependent clauses are negated with the negator -ma:r- which follows the verb stem. If the
verb stem undergoes vowel changes in a non-future negative form (as outlined in §11.3.2), the
non-future negative form is preferred, e.g. kur- ‘do/get’, negative ma: kwa:r ‘do(es) not/did not
do/get’, dependent negative kwa:r-ma:r-, k@l- ‘dry (of water)’, ma: ka:l ‘do(es) not/did not dry’,
negative dependent ka:l-ma:r- (also see the ﬁrst line of 14.55, with the form kwa:y- ‘negative
non-future give.to.third.person’). There is a tendency to reduce either the root vowel, or the
aﬃx vowel, so as to avoid having two long vowels in one phonological word (in agreement
with §2.5.1). That is, variants kwar-ma:r- (rather than kwa:r-ma:r-) and ka:l-mar- (rather than
ka:l-ma:r) are not uncommon.
   However, many speakers use a non-negative form, as is the case in a headless relative clause
in 14.122. Those who prefer the negative form are typically innovative ‘big men’; while women,
who are more traditional speakers, tend to use the non-negative form.
   The negative dependent marker -ma:r- is used in three basic contexts: to negate the predicate
of a variety of types of dependent clause (§14.5.1), to negate the predicate of questions (§14.5.2),
                                                   14.5 Negation of dependent clauses       325and in independent clauses, among them the ones expressing wishes and laments (§14.5.3). That
the three clause types are negated in the same way indicates similarities in their underlying
structure.
   The marker -ma:r- is compatible with the future and the non-past habitual -kwa- (see 14.58,
14.118, and 14.124) in juxtaposed clauses, causal clauses, and relative clauses. (The action-
focus -na-, the future, or the optative modality are not used in any of these.) In all other
clauses, -ma:r- occurs with whatever clause-chaining aﬃxes are appropriate. The negative
clauses preserve the same speciﬁcations as the corresponding non-negative clauses. That is,
diﬀerent-subject clauses keep their subject cross-referencing in positive and in negative forms
(see 14.19, 14.112, and 14.113), and same-subject clauses have none in either (as in 14.111).
A non-negative uninﬂected predicate remains uninﬂected if negated, as does the manner
sequential form (14.109), the cotemporaneous form (14.114), and the immediate sequencing
form (14.115).","[349, 350, 351, 352]"

  18 The variant n@ ‘one’ as in n@ . . . n@ ‘one . . . another’ of the number ‘one’ (whose form is nak) could be a shortened
form of the indeﬁnite pronoun n@k@ ‘another, other’ which is semantically very similar (see §10.3).
58     2 PhonologyB. Phonological Processes on Clitic Boundaries Within a Phonological Word
B1. Reduction of sequences of identical consonants. A sequence of identical consonants
on the boundary between a clitic and its host is reduced to a single consonant, e.g. kl@m
‘here (feminine singular)’ = ma:n ‘negative’ → kl@má:n ‘here not’ (§2.5.3, II). A complex verb
consisting of an adverb and a verb undergoes similar simpliﬁcation: what is bás s@tuá ‘I ask’
in very slow speech register becomes bas@tuá in normal speech register. Cf. A6, for a similar
process on suﬃx boundary.
B2. Vowel elision on clitic boundary. A sequence of -@ = -a becomes -a, e.g. l@ ata → lata
‘she then’, s@ ab@r → sab@r ‘these are two names’ etc. A similar rule applies on a suﬃx
boundary (see A4). However, the diﬀerence between A4 and B2 is that B2 is optional: a proclitic
like l@ can be pronounced as a separate word, and then vowel elision will not take place (as
shown in 2.1b, 2.1c). There is no such option for a suﬃx boundary where vowel elision is
always obligatory.
   The vowel elision does not apply with the cliticizable a ‘third singular feminine’ which occurs
on non-verbal predicate heads, e.g. s´@=á (name=3fem.sg.nom) ‘it is a name’ (not ∗ sa).
B3. Vowel fusion and simplification on clitic boundary. A sequence of two identical
vowels across a clitic boundary undergoes fusion and subsequent simpliﬁcation, e.g. a = a →
a, as in kus@dá=aká → [kus@dákà] ‘he ﬁnished thus’. This process is very frequent in
rapid speech, e.g. d@-k@-d@=a-d@ ra:w (he-obl-masc.sg=dem.dist-masc.sg maternal.nephew)
‘that maternal nephew of his’ is pronounced as [d@-k@-da-d@ ra:w]. A sequence ata=adakw
(then=stay) ‘stay then’ becomes [atadakw].
B4. Further fast speech phenomena. A posture verb preceded by another verb in a sequenc-
ing form -n ‘doing at the same time as’ (§18.2) can be pronounced together as one phonological
word, and then the ﬁnal -n of the ﬁrst verb is elided: wuk´@-n r@-na-wún (listen-seq sit-act.foc-
1sgbas.vt) ‘I am sitting listening; I am listening’ is pronounced, in fast speech, as [wuk´@r@na-
wun]; and wapá-n napa-kú (leave-seq compl.vb-compl.ss) ‘having left for good, having fully
completed leaving’ becomes [wapànapakú]. A sequence of two verbs one of which is monosyl-
labic may also result, as in dá:-n adá (sit-seq stay.impv) ‘sit down’ pronounced as [dá:n-dà]. (A
year-old baby repeatedly reproduced this command as dandá, which for her was a way to refer
to a chair: see §13.2.2.)
C1. Epenthetic glide y is inserted on any boundary, breaking a sequence of i and a, as in saki-
ab ‘name debate-too’ > [saki-y-ab]; tami=ad (area=3masc.sg.nom) ‘it is an area’ > [tami-y-ad],
and aki=ata ‘news then’ > [aki-y-ata].
                               2.7 i n t o nat i o n patt e r n sFalling intonation is characteristic of the end of a declarative clause. Interrogative intonation
contour involves rising intonation on the last word of a clause (marked with Ű) with high pitch
on the clause as a whole and an additional rising pitch on the last syllable, as in:
2.3 ak@         s@k@r waku-k@-na-d@m@nŰ?
    what.fem.sg time go.out-fut-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
    ‘What time will you go out?’
  In a rhetorical question, the sharp rise can be preceded by a falling intonation on the ﬁrst
word (marked with Ů):
                                                                  2.7 Intonation patterns       592.4 ñ@nŮ        agulaŰ?
    you.fem.sg why
    ‘What are you here for?
  Commands have a slightly rising intonation, as in 2.5–6:
2.5 p@s@pa:m            atakŰ
    rubbish+lk+loc impv+put
    ‘Put (this) into the rubbish!’
2.6 da-n        adaŰ
    go.down-seq sit.impv
    ‘Sit down!’
   A combination of falling and rising intonation is characteristic of ﬁrst person imperative
clauses, often used as a marker of turn taking in discourse:
2.7 waŮuŰ
    speak+1sgimpv
    ‘May I talk?’
   Vocative intonation involves slight rise on the last syllable of the vocative and simultaneous
lengthening of vowel in the last syllable of the vocative forms (restricted to kinship terms and
personal names).
2.8 Maliye:::Ű
    ‘Mali!’
   Farewelling intonation is similar, with the proviso that it involves slight rise and then slight
fall on the last syllable (note that its vowel is often lengthened):
2.9 yaradákw@::: ŰŮ
    well+stay.impv
    ‘Stay well’ (said by someone who is leaving as a farewell formula)
   Exclamatory clauses involve a sharply falling intonation contour, especially if they include
interjections expressing surprise, e.g. waŮ ‘Wow, oh dear’.
   A further pattern in complex sentences which involve sequences of clauses involves rising
intonation on the completive medial verb (see Chapter 18). The ﬁnal verb of the ﬁrst clause is
repeated in the subsequent medial clause. A diﬀerent-subject medial clause is shown in 2.10.
Clause-ﬁnal falling intonation in 2.10 is shown with Ů.
2.10 adiya                 y@-na-diŮ        [short pause] y@-da-kŰ        ata

     wa-dŮ
     say-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘They went. Them having gone, he said’
  A short pause only appears if some time is supposed to have elapsed between the time of the
ﬁrst sentence, and of the second one. A medial verb may form one phonological phrase with
the ﬁnal verb in the preceding main clause if no time is understood to have elapsed between
the two sentences. In 2.11, this is signalled with square brackets around the sequence of two
verbs:y@-dì y@-kú. The last (stressed) syllable of y@-kú is pronouncd with more intensity than
the last (stressed) syllable of y@-dì.
60     2 Phonology2.11 adiya                 [y@-dì      y@-kú]Ű      ata wa-diŮ
     dem.dist.react.top.pl go-3plbas.p go-compl.ss then say-3plbas.pŰ
     ‘They went. They went, having gone, they said’
   This same intonation pattern also appears in Tok Pisin when spoken by the Manambu.
This pattern has been observed with medial verbs marked with some sequencing morphemes
(e.g. cotemporaneous sequencing -ta:y), but not others (the immediate sequencing -taka, the
temporal overlap -(k@)k@b, and the sequencing -@n). Juxtaposed dependent clauses have a
distinctive intonation contour with the pitch going high up on the last syllable of the predicate
(see §19.1).
        3        Grammatical Relations
Understanding grammatical relations in Manambu is pivotal for understanding its grammar.
A member of any major word class can head an intransitive predicate, or be a modiﬁer in an
NP. A verb as head of either transitive or intransitive predicate takes tense- and topicality-
sensitive verbal cross-referencing suﬃxes, to mark subject (A/S) and non-subject. In contrast,
if a member of most other classes is head in an intransitive predicate, it takes person-marking
enclitics (§3.1). Grammatical relations are also marked by cases on nouns, on subject-non-
subject basis (§3.2), and through a set of demonstratives, on an absolutive basis (§3.3).
                                3.1 c ro s s -referencingNouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and most closed subclasses (see Chapter 10) can head an
intransitive predicate. Only a verb can be head of a transitive predicate. In the indicative mood,
all Manambu verbs can cross-reference one or two arguments. One of these has to be the
subject—A or S. A non-subject argument can also be cross-referenced if it is more topical than
the subject, independently of the verb’s transitivity.
   This is how it works. In 3.1, the S=A ambitransitive verb ‘know’ is used intransitively. The
suﬃx -na- ‘action focus’ indicates that the focus is on the fact of knowing, and not on what
is known. The subject (S), ‘I’, is cross-referenced on the verb. The cross-referencing suﬃxes
employed are in Table 3.1.
3.1 b@      laku-na-wun
    already know/understand-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘I know (already), I am knowledgeable’
  This same verb can be used transitively, with an object. The object in 3.2 is not topical—
that is, it is not something to be further deployed in the discourse. The subject (A) is the only
participant cross-referenced on the verb:
3.2 (wun) a                  yar@k b@    laku-na-wun
    I       dem.dist+fem.sg news already know/understand-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘I already know that news’
   If a constituent other than the subject is more topical than the subject, both are cross-
referenced on the verb. In 3.3–4 the object is topical, and it is cross-referenced in the second
position on the verb, with the same markers as the ones used for the S/A in 3.1–2 (Table 3.1).
The subject is also cross-referenced, but with a diﬀerent set of markers (Table 3.2). Person
marking on the verb can occur together with a full NP. Since the NP is optional, it is in
parentheses.
3.3 (d@ wun-a:m) laku-da-wun
    he i-lk+obj know-3masc.sgsubj.vt-1fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘He knows me’

    dem.dist-masc.sg story I         know-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
    ‘I have understood it (e.g. a long story)’
  An oblique can be cross-referenced on the verb, if topical. The destination, ‘road’, is the
topic of 3.5, and is cross-referenced in the second position on the intransitive verb ‘go’. The
road is in the allative case (§7.5).
3.5 (wun) a-d@                yaba:r           yi-tua-d
    I      dem.dist-masc.sg road+lk+all go-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
    ‘I went towards that road’ (that we are talking about)
   The choice of an argument or an oblique to be cross-referenced on a verb depends on the
topicality of this argument (or oblique), and also on the verb’s semantics. Out of context,
3.6 could be understood as ‘I ﬁnished that work (we were talking about)’ (then, the object
‘work’ would be cross-referenced), or as ‘I ﬁnished that work at that (topical) time’ (then,
‘time’ would be cross-referenced), or as ‘I ﬁnished that work in that (topical) way’ (then
‘way, manner’, of feminine gender (§5.2.1), would be cross-referenced). The cross-referenced
constituent can be overtly expressed, but does not have to, inasmuch as it is retrievable from the
context:
3.6 a                 yawi kus@-tu@-l
    dem.dist+fem.sg work ﬁnish-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
    ‘I ﬁnished that work (we were talking about)’
    ‘I ﬁnished that work at that (topical) time’
    ‘I ﬁnished that work in that (topical) way’
  Example 3.7 also has two meanings—diﬀerentiated only by the context.
3.7 ñap-a-ta:kw                Dora kui-la-b@r
    mother’s.sister-lk-woman Dora give.to.third.p-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
    ‘Aunt Dora gave (us) these two (Malay apples)’
    ‘Aunt Dora gave (Malay apples) to the two (girls)’
  Topical constituents which can be cross-referenced in the second position include time,
location, destination, and manner. The following can never be cross-referenced:
  (a) A copula complement—see 3.8 and 3.9. The copula subject is always cross-referenced;
      the second position can be occupied by location, manner or time.
3.8 a-b@r        ñ@di        kwakuli t@-b@r

    dem.dist-du children:du orphan become/be/stand-3dusubj.p-3plbas.p
    ‘They became orphans at those times, or in those ways, or in those places’
  (b) The second argument of verbs of ‘becoming’ or ‘turning into’:
3.10 l@ aka b@          m@d        patiaku-l
     she here already cassowary turn-3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘She has then already turned into a cassowary’

      bathe’; m@l ‘eye’ in m@l v@- (eye see) ‘see with eyes’; or wapruku- ‘be overfull’, as 3.11.
      Here, ‘house’ (of masculine gender) is the subject:
3.11 br@-k@-d@        wi     miyawa sa:n-a-d@ka    wapruku-d
     3du-obl-masc.sg house all       money-lk-only overﬁll-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘Their whole house was overﬂowing with money’
  (d) A constituent marked with a transportative, substitutive, or comitative case—see
      §§7.7–9.
  (e) A speech report—see §19.5.
   Ellipsis of noun phrases, frequent in speech, makes the exact reference of cross-referenced
participants highly context dependent. Statistically, some participants tend to be cross-
referenced more often than others. For instance, the addressee of the verb wa- ‘say’ is more
often cross-referenced than the message. This has to do with the fact that wa- is frequently
used to frame direct speech reports which can never be cross-referenced. A form wa-k@-tua-di
(say-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt) can mean ‘I will tell (something) to them’, or ‘I will tell them,
e.g. stories’, depending on the context.
   A form kur-m@na-d@wun (do/make-2sgsubj.vt-1masc.sgbas.vt) is more likely to mean ‘you
did (something) to me’, than ‘you created or made me’, if the story from which this example
comes is not a creation myth. With the verb ‘give’, the overall frequency of cross-referencing
either the ‘recipient’ or the ‘gift’ is the same (this goes against the frequently discussed pref-
erence, among the languages of the world, to mark the recipient rather than the ‘gift’ of
‘give’).
   In contrast to verbs, non-verbal predicates cross-reference just the subject, with cross-
referencing enclitics listed in Table 3.4.
   Table 3.1 features the ‘basic’ set of cross-referencing markers used for
   (i) the subject, if no other, more topical, constituent is to be cross-referenced—as in 3.1–2;
  (ii) the more topical constituent other than the subject—as in 3.3–5.
   In situation (ii), the subject is cross-referenced with a special set of cross-referencing suﬃxes
as listed in Table 3.2. A marker from this set is always followed by a marker from the ‘basic’ set.
The relevant verbal cross-referencing sets distinguish what we call ‘versatile tense’ (employed
for present, recent past, and in future contexts—see §12.2). The tense distinction is neutralized
in dual and plural of the basic set. The non-tense-sensitive suﬃxes in the subject set are the
ones used in partially inﬂected verbal forms (where only the subject is expressed: see §11.1.1).
   The two sets of personal markers are similar, but not identical. The versatile tense basic set
diﬀers from its past counterpart only in the feminine singular forms. The versatile tense subject
markers diﬀer from their past tense counterpart in the quality of the ﬁnal vowel in all the forms
except for ﬁrst and third person plural where the present–recent past set has an extra syllable
-na.
   The basic sets diﬀer from the subject sets in ﬁrst person (all numbers). The subject set has no
gender distinctions in ﬁrst person. The basic sets are easily segmentable: they contain gender-
number markers -d- ‘masculine’, -l/ø- ‘feminine’ in the singular, and number markers -b@r -
‘dual’ and -di- ‘plural’, in dual and plural forms respectively.
   All other forms are similar to personal pronouns featured in Table 3.3. The basic set shows
more similarities with the personal pronouns than the subject set. The ﬁrst person markers in
the subject sets are not related to the personal pronouns at all.

with a non-verb as a predicate head are given in Table 3.4. The segmental make-up of the
markers is almost identical with the basic cross-referencing set in Table 3.1.
  The diﬀerence lies (a) in that the markers in Table 3.4 are enclitics and the ones in Table 3.1
are suﬃxes (see §§2.5–6 on the diﬀerences between these), and (b) in the existence of free
variants of ﬁrst and third person singular feminine forms. The vowel a in the forms in Table
3.4 can be considered a kind of linker; note its absence with the suﬃxes.
  Example 3.12 illustrates an adjective, and 3.13 an adverb as head of intransitive predicates.
3.12 a-di         ja:p kuprap=adi
     dem.dist-pl thing bad=3plnom
     ‘These things are bad’
3.13 yabi:b-yabi:b=ad
     quickly-quickly=3masc.sgnom
     ‘It (the way he is moving) is very quickly’
In 2.1–2 nouns were used as predicate heads. These same enclitics mark focused constituents,
in highlighting focus constructions (see §20.3).
   The choice between cross-referencing just the subject or also an additional participant on a
Manambu verb is largely independent of the verb’s transitivity: both transitive and intransitive
verbs can cross-reference one or two arguments.
   Importantly, the number of arguments cross-referenced correlates with the grammatical
categories of the verb. The option of either one or two cross-referencing positions is available
for independent positive indicative declarative and interrogative clauses, positive and nega-
tive habitual declarative and interrogative clauses, relative clauses, and dependent juxtaposed
clauses (both negative and positive). See examples 3.1–10 above. Such forms are fully inﬂected
for person (see §11.1.1; Table 11.1). Only one cross-referencing position is available for all these
clauses if the verb contains the action focus marker -na-. Causal clauses and all diﬀerent-subject
medial clauses also cross-reference just the subject (with the non-tensed suﬃxes in Table 3.2).
The imperative has its own paradigm of subject cross-referencing (see §13.2). All these forms
are partially inﬂected.

   No cross-referencing is found in negative declarative non-habitual clauses, in positive com-
pletive and customary aspects and in a variety of non-declarative forms including prohibitive,
desiderative, and frustrative, and all same-subject medial clauses. These forms are uninﬂected.
See a summary in Table 11.1.
   The number of cross-referencing positions on the verb only marginally relates to mood,
modality, polarity, and aspect. Most of the verbal forms which accept one cross-referencing
position or take no cross-referencing are non-declarative. Most negative forms take no cross-
referencing at all.
   The number of cross-referencing positions is independent of the verb’s transitivity. It
depends on the pragmatic properties of the non-subject constituent, and not so much the
lexical properties of the verb itself. This is partly reminiscent of Ugric and Samoyedic
languages.
   There, a special verbal conjugation (called ‘objective’) is used for transitive verbs if the
object is deﬁnite or topical. A transitive verb with an indeﬁnite object appears in the ‘sub-
jective’ conjugation (see, for instance, Moravcsik 1983 on Hungarian and Nikolaeva 1999 on
Northern Khanty). Diﬀerent sets of cross-referencing suﬃxes in Menya, an Angan language
from Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea (Whitehead 1991), mark more topical, and less
topical, subjects. However, in neither case is there a complete analogy with the Manambu
system.
   The marking of A/S as the only cross-referenced constituent (‘basic’ marking set) is the same
as the marking of the second argument if it is more topical than the subject. This may seem
reminiscent of split ergativity whereby, under certain conditions, the S constituent (the only       Table 3.4 Person marking on non-verbs as heads of predicate                                 Sg                         Du                   Pl         1 fem    =awun, =al-wun as free variants

a transitive verb). 1 However, the Manambu pattern is only superﬁcially similar to this, since:
  (a) the basic cross-referencing set marks A/S and also O, a locative, a manner, or a time
      constituent, that is, it is hardly comparable with a ‘real’ ergative/absolutive system, with
      an opposition between S/O and A; and
  (b) the occurrence of the marking is conditioned by the topicality of the participant and
      only partly by its grammatical function (we can recall that some relations, such as copula
      complement, or comitative, are never cross-referenced).
The closest analogy to the Manambu system comes from Alamblak (Sepik Hill: Bruce 1984:
184–8, 216–30). Here, an argument additional to the subject can be cross-referenced on the
verb ‘if it can be thought of as a crucial participant in the situation’ (219). Just as in Manambu,
the second argument marker follows the marker of the subject. However, unlike Manambu,
the same set of markers cross-references both arguments, and there are no special sets for non-
verbal predicates. It is not clear whether there are any types of arguments which can never be
cross-referenced. Sare (or Kapriman), also from the Sepik Hill family, does not have this feature
(Sumbuk 1999). Is this similarity between Manambu and Alamblak a simple coincidence? Or,
given that some Manambu subclans claim their origins to be in the area of Chambri lake—
to the south of which Alamblak is spoken (see §1.5.3)—could this be an areal feature? The
question remains open. Also see §§22.2–3, where we return to the issue of areal diﬀusion.
We conclude that, though marking the pragmatic status of constituents through variation in
cross-referencing patterns on the verb is not unprecedented, no other system we know of is
fully comparable with the way Manambu verbs mark their participants.
             3.2 gramm atical relat ions marked on noun phrasesCases in Manambu mark grammatical relations on a basic nominative-accusative principle.
Only deﬁnite and completely aﬀected objects are marked with the -Vm case ‘accusative/
locative’ (see §7.3 for a hypothesis concerning the motivation for this case syncretism). Table
3.5 summarizes the principles of dependent marking on nouns, and how these correlate with
the marking on verbs as heads of predicates.
   Table 3.5 shows that grammatical functions covered by the second-position cross-referencing
suﬃxes only somewhat overlap with the ones covered by cases. The case syncretism does not
fully coincide with the syncretism of meanings available for the basic cross-referencing set
when it refers to a non-subject constituent. We can recall that this may refer to location (for
which three cases are available: a location can be unmarked, marked with a locative case or
the terminative case); to an object (one case available), or to an instrument or manner (one
case available). This illustrates one-to-many correspondences in the relationship between cross-
referencing on the verb and case marking on nouns. Case meanings below the thick line in
Table 3.5 do not have a cross-referencing correlate: these constituents are not cross-referenced.
   An object marked with the accusative/locative case is likely to be a topic, and is cross-
referenced more often than an unmarked O, in terms of textual frequency. However, this is not a
   1 Instances whereby a language has an ergative pattern of marking grammatical relations depending on the topical
continuity of S/O include Asheninca Campa (an Arawak language from Peru: Payne and Payne (2005) showed how
a split intransitive pattern marks the main story line, or foregrounded actions). In Yagua (Peba-Yagua) and Pajonal
Campa (Arawak), S is marked like O to highlight some new information (but not a new participant) (Dixon 1994:
211).

steadfast rule: if another constituent is more topical than the O, then it will be cross-referenced.
We saw in 3.7 above that, with the verb ‘give’, either the gift or the recipient can be cross-
referenced, depending on their topicality. Only the ‘gift’ can be marked with accusative/locative,
while the recipient is always marked with dative.
   In 3.14, the place which is the topic of the stretch of discourse is cross-referenced on the verb
(with the feminine gender form). The indeﬁnite direct object, unmarked for case, is not.

     ‘I shoot that garﬁsh (in this place we are in now)’
   Alternatively, a completely aﬀected O marked with the accusative/locative case may be less
topical than the subject, especially if the verb is marked with the action focus -na-. In 3.15,
the angry man is determined to exterminate the moon who, as he thinks, is responsible for his
wife’s menstruation. The moon is marked for case and is the topic of the story, but is not cross-
referenced: the action focus -na- shows that the focus is on the action and it is more important
than the O.

referencing of O.
   We conclude that cross-referencing on verbs and case marking on nouns follow diﬀerent
principles. Verbs distinguish between subject and (topical) non-subject, while nouns operate on
a principle reminiscent of nominative-accusative. In addition, nouns distinguish a rather large
number of forms for non-core participants. We return to the discussion of cases in Chapter 7.
                    3.3 ‘ r e ac t i vat e d t o pi c’ d e m o n s t rat i v e sThere are three series of demonstratives marking ‘reactivated topic’—k@- series ‘proximal to
the speaker’, wa- series ‘proximal to the hearer’, and a- series ‘distant from both’ (discussed in
detail in §10.2.3). These always agree in gender and number with the S/O argument. They are
employed to bring an already established topic ‘back to action’, if it has not been mentioned
for some time. Consider 3.16, said to 5-year-old Kerryanne who was running around at a
local market, to remind her of the existence of her mother and myself (whom she ought to
be following):
3.16 abra                       yi-na-b@r
     dem.dist.react.top+dual go-act.foc-3dubas.vt
     ‘Those two are going!’ (I am reminding you of them; or else you will be left behind)
  If an O constituent is a reactivated topic, it is obligatorily cross-referenced on the verb (using
the basic set in the second cross-referencing position). In 3.17, the bundle of sago established
as a topic in the previous stretch of discourse is mentioned again. Since it is topical, it is also
cross-referenced on the verb:
3.17 na:gw ada                            ka-war-la-d
     sago dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg carry-go.up-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘She has carried up that previously mentioned sago’
   With the ditransitive verb ‘give’, a reactivated topic marker refers to the recipient rather
than the gift if it is more animate than the gift, unless the gift is more topical. Example 3.18
comes from a story about a man (the topic of the whole story) who was considered dead by
his relatives. In the previous stretch of text the ﬂying fox who had been looking after the man
tells him that his relatives were arranging a mortuary feast for him. The man has not been
mentioned for a paragraph or so. Then, it turns out that the preparations for the mortuary
feast for the man are under way at the man’s house. The man is thus ‘brought back’ into the
text as the reactivated topic. The mortuary feast, in the O function in 3.18, is the gift; the
‘reactivated topic demonstrative’, and the cross-referencing on the verb, refer to the man:
70     3 Grammatical Relations3.18 maja:n          ada                            kui-da-d
     mortuary.feast dem.dist.react.top+3masc.sg give.to.third.p-3plsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘They were giving mortuary feast to him (the reactivated topic)’
   We will see, in §10.2.3, that a reactivated topic demonstrative can refer to the S of an
ambitransitive verb used intransitively. It can also refer to a location, as in 10.68. The content
of a direct speech report is never referred to with such a demonstrative. The problem of whether
the reactivated topic demonstrative forms one NP with a noun it refers to or not is discussed
in §10.2.3.
   The predominantly absolutive (S/O) basis for the reactivated topic markers agrees with a
cross-linguistic tendency for a correlation between the S/O function and topicality (Du Bois
1987). That a demonstrative should operate on an absolutive basis is hardly surprising—in
Dyirbal and a few other languages, an NP including a nominal demonstrative may only occur
in S or O function (Dixon 2003: 83, 94–99; Aikhenvald and Dixon forthcoming). Reactivated
topic demonstratives provide a strong criterion for S (see, for instance, the discussion of
polyfunctional verbs and their argument structure in §4.2.2). The subject of a verbless clause or
head of non-verbal predicate is hardly ever referred to with the reactivated topic demonstrative
(the implication of this is that it is not treated on a par with S arguments).
            3.4 gra m m at i c a l r e lat i o n s i n m a na m bu: a s ummaryCross-referencing on the verb and case marking on nouns in Manambu operate on diﬀerent
principles. The choice of cross-referencing depends on the tense-aspect-mood and polarity, and
on the presence of a participant more topical than the subject. Case marking is reminiscent
of a nominative-accusative system, with the occurrence of the object case depending on the
deﬁniteness and the degree of involvement of the O. Systems of this kind are cross-linguistically
attested (see Aikhenvald 1994 for a brief survey).
   Cross-referencing on the verb is more unusual. It follows a subject-non-subject principle. The
subject of a verb, be it A or S, always has to be cross-referenced. Any non-subject constituent—
with the exception of copula complement, transportative, comitative, and substitutive con-
stituents, and speech reports—can be cross-referenced. (This is reminiscent of Alamblak, from
the Sepik Hill family.) The same, ‘basic’, marking is used for cross-referencing the subject (A/S)
with no other topical constituent; and for cross-referencing a topical non-subject. In addition,
all of the A/S of all verbs are marked in the same way. The subject of a non-verbal predicate
head acquires a somewhat diﬀerent marking, and does not distinguish tense.
   In addition, three series of demonstratives marking ‘reactivated topic’ operate on an absolu-
tive basis, marking gender and number agreement with the topical S/O argument which is then
highly likely to be cross-referenced on the verb.
   The three ways of marking grammatical relations allow for a highly elaborate way of speci-
fying the topicality of participants and the involvement and deﬁniteness of the object.
   A historical note is in order. The dependent marking on nouns appears older than the
unusual system of verbal cross-referencing. Cases for core arguments are a shared feature
of Ndu languages, while the personal marking of two arguments on verbs appears to be a
Manambu innovation also shared with Gala. Iatmul has only subject cross-referencing which
appears to be a relatively recent innovation.
        4        Word Classes
Open word classes in Manambu are nouns (§4.1) and verbs (§4.2) Two subclasses of adjectives
are discussed in §4.3, and §4.4 focuses on the semi-closed class of adverbs. A brief overview of
closed classes is in §4.5.
                                           4.1 nounsAll nouns have grammatical categories of gender (Chapter 5), number (Chapter 6), and case
(Chapter 7). Syntactically, a noun can be both head and dependent in possessive constructions
(Chapter 8), head and modiﬁer in an NP, and head of predicate (see §4.3 and §4.4). Derivation
and compounding are discussed in Chapter 9. The types of noun phrases and their features
(including word order) are addressed in Chapter 20, within the context of other multiword
constituents.
   Nouns divide into a number of subclasses, in terms of their morphophonological properties
(§,4.1.1) and in terms of semantics and correlating grammatical properties of their referents
(§4.1.2).","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"

       the village’ (lit. going going out in the village)
  Manambu does not have a morphological resultative derivation—desubordinated medial
sequencing clauses play the part of ‘resultative’ strategies.
  Medial completive clauses, typically same-subject ones, can be used on their own, with a
completive meaning. A speaker came into the house and showed us a ﬁsh, commenting on
how she had obtained it:
19.112 [sa:n yapi-ku]
       money buy/pay-compl.ss
       ‘I have paid money (for it)’ (lit. having paid money (for it)
  This completive use is semantically close to the meaning of the anterior complex predicate
with the auxiliary t@- discussed at §17.1.1. Yet, it is diﬀerent inasmuch as the focus is on the
completion of the action and the result achieved.
  Desubordination has its roots in ellipsis. Yet the two are diﬀerent. Consider 19.113b, an
answer to the question in 19.113a:
19.113a ak@         s@k@r væra-k-ñ@na
        what.fem.sg time come.back-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgsubj.vt
        ‘What time will you come back?’
19.113b [na:gw yapi-ku]
        sago buy-compl.ss
        ‘After I had bought sago’ (lit. having bought sago)
  This has a clear overtone of sequencing and of relative tense: ‘I will come back after I’ve
bought sago’. Not so with 19.112 which simply focuses on the completion of an action. (An
additional way of focusing on the completion of one action before the start of another is
through using ya:kya ‘OK’ or its Tok Pisin equivalent orait in lieu of a main clause. We return
to this in §20.4.2.)
  Along similar lines, a cotemporaneous clause can be used on its own, to express prolonged
action that started before the moment of speech and goes on and on. An example is at
19.114—a mother was exhausted by her baby daughter’s drinking and peeing non-stop. Similar
examples are at 4.33 and 18.35.
19.114 [gu     k@-ta:y]           [wus yi-ta:y]
       water consume-cotemp pee go-cotemp
       ‘All she does is drink and pee’ (lit. having drunk water having peed)
  Desubordinated cotemporaneous clauses typically occur in pairs, as in 19.114, 4.33, and
18.35, referring to continuous alternate or simultaneous actions. Since Manambu does not
have a dedicated verbal form to cover this meaning, once again a desubordinated verb can be
said to ﬁll in a gap.
  Desubordination of the three dependent clause types discussed here goes hand in hand with
grammaticalizing the most frequent desubordinated forms into connectives. We saw in §18.3
that the form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a conjunction ‘thus, and so’ (18.28).
506     19 Other Dependent ClausesThis form is indeed in the process of grammaticalization as part of a complex connective:
al@k t@-ku (dem.dist.fem.sg+dat stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so,
as a result’ (§19.6 and 19.78). Fixed combinations [ak@m t@-ku] (where+loc stay-compl.ss)
or [ak@b t@-ku] (where+term stay-compl.ss) meaning ‘where from?’ (as in 7.29 and 7.55) are
frequently used as an interrogative on their own: we can recall, from §10.4, that Manambu does
not have a dedicated interrogative form meaning ‘where from’ (there is one meaning ‘where to’,
and another one meaning ‘where (location)’). A desubordinated verb is again used to ﬁll a gap:
ak@m t@-ku can be considered a new interrogative form. Desubordinated sequencing forms
containing -n are on the way towards being reinterpreted as adverbs; see 18.7–8 in §18.2 (also
see §4.4). Unlike corresponding verbal forms, they cannot be negated separately.
   We can recall, from 18.8, that s@b@n@-n (return-seq) can be used as a verbal modiﬁer meaning
‘back’, and can also be used as a medial verb ‘returning’. The two usages can be distinguished:
the verb in a dependent clause can have its own arguments and obliques and can be negated,
and the verbal modiﬁer cannot.
   The dependent clause verb s@b@n-@n in its negative and positive form is illustrated in 19.115.
The relevant forms are underlined.
19.115 [l@ wiya:r            s@b@n-@n] [ñan-ugw-a:k        kamna:gw

       give.to.3p-fut-3fem.sgsubj return-neg.dep-seq give.to.third.pneg neg
       ‘On returning to the house (or: by returning to the house) she will give children food,
       on not returning (or: by not returning) she won’t give (it to them)’
The same form s@b@n@n reanalysed as a verbal modiﬁer in 18.8 cannot be negated, since
negation is a clausal category in Manambu, and a verbal modiﬁer cannot be negated.
  A cotemporaneous form of wa- ‘say’ in the form ata-wa-ta:y (then-say-cotemp) has devel-
oped into a connective ‘and so then, in summary, this is why’—see §19.6 (especially example
19.80). And the verb yi- with a sequencing medial clause marker -n is often employed as a
marker of continuing action, as in 18.9 and 19.116.
19.116 [kwasa-kwasa-di sa:s           yin]    [numa-di kuyak t@-na-di]
       small-small-pl     boil/bubble go+seq big-pl    wound be/stand-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘Tiny tiny boils gradually become big wounds’
   In 19.116, little boils or bubble-like spots on the skin do not go anywhere: as they develop
on and on, they grow into big wounds. It is this process of gradually and continually changing
state that is captured by yi:n ‘going’.
   In summary: desubordination of dependent clauses and subsequent grammaticalization of
the most frequently used desubordinated forms is an ongoing process in Manambu.
        20        Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices
We now turn to further issues in Manambu syntax, starting with a discussion of the structure
of major constituents and order of words within them. We then summarize the properties of
clause types and criteria for determining core grammatical relations (§20.1). We then discuss the
pragmatic motivations behind the ordering of constituents within clauses (§20.2). Highlighting
focus constructions are discussed in §20.3. The devices used for linking sentences in discourse,
including turn taking, and marking of topicality, are addressed in §20.4. There we also deal
with the principles of ellipsis—a prominent feature of Manambu discourse.                 20.1 m a j o r c o n s t i t u e n t s, c laus e ty p e s, and
                              grammatical relat ions                          20.1.1 The structure of noun phrasesA noun phrase in Manambu is composed of a head—usually, a noun—and one or more
modiﬁers. If the noun head is omitted, a modiﬁer can be used in headless noun phrases. Closed
classes diﬀer in terms of whether they can occur as NP heads—this is summarized in Table
10.11 in §10.7. If a noun phrase is headed by a pronoun, no further modiﬁers can be used.
   Inﬂected verbs within relative clauses, nouns, adjectives, and a number of closed classes
(personal pronouns, indeﬁnite pronoun n@k@- ‘other, another’, quantiﬁers, and numbers) can
all be modiﬁers in a noun phrase. We recall (§4.1.1) that prehead modiﬁers take a linker which
is only partially predictable. The most frequent order of modiﬁers in a noun phrase is in
Scheme 20.1.
   As shown in §10.2.1, a spatio-temporal demonstrative and a ‘current relevance’ demon-
strative can occur together in one NP, as in 10.40–1. The current relevance demonstrative
with no gender or number speciﬁcation occurs ﬁrst and the spatio-temporal one follows,
providing further speciﬁcation. The two complement each other, since the ‘current relevance’
demonstrative does not convey information about the gender of the noun or its additional
distance from either the speaker or the addressee. And a spatio-temporal demonstrative can
provide supplementary directional speciﬁcation.
   Consider 20.1. Combining two demonstratives in one noun phrase allows the speaker to be
speciﬁc about the location of the village which is both upstream and inland, that is, away from
the river from where he is. The location ‘away from the river’ is expressed with a demonstrative
which follows the one stating the location ‘upstream’:20.1 k@-na-wur                 k@-d@-wul                   t@p-ad
     dem.prox-curr.rel-up dem.prox-masc.sg-inland village-3masc.sgnom
     ‘It is this-previously mentioned village upstream, this-away from the river big village’  That the village is big is clear from the masculine gender assignment (§5.2.1).

"                                     12.1.2 Action focusThe action focus marker -na- indicates that the activity itself rather than any of the participants
is in focus; in clauses which contain the action focus marker there are no participants more
salient or topical than the subject. In fact, other participants are often backgrounded.
   The action focus is often used in clauses describing actions which take place one after
another, as in 12.5 (the forms are underlined). All the actions are happening at the same time
as the speech act itself, with the exception of the last clause where the action is immediately
preceding the time of speech act.

     ‘This (topical) water of yours is ﬂowing. My son and I we are drinking the water we
     brought, this is how it is, I have no place to sleep, this is why I have come in here’
  The recent past reference is often emphasized by the adverb b@ ‘already’, as in 12.6.
12.6 kamna:gw b@         k@-na-d?
     food        already eat-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘Has he eaten yet?’
  As mentioned above, traditional stories are usually cast in past tense. However, vivid
accounts of actual events are often cast in the versatile tense, with the action-focus marker
employed to focus the audience’s attention on the event itself.
256      12 Verbal Categories   This is illustrated in 12.7, from a story about how the Avatip men had killed the Japanese
invaders during the Second World War. At the very beginning, the speaker establishes the past
time frame. As soon as he starts talking about the action itself, he switches to versatile tense
(ﬁrst line of 12.7).
   This was followed by a sequence of actions which describe the attack, each marked with
action focus. The sequence was interrupted once (lines 6–7), by the speaker bringing the
audience back to the time frame of the narrative, and saying: ‘this was the time when we the
fathers were also young’. Here, the verb form is in bold. It is also in highlighting focus, and this
is why it is marked with an additional set of nominal enclitics. (The feminine cross-referencing
here refers to the time of event: ‘time’ in Manambu is inherently feminine.) After this insertion,
the speaker goes back to his lively narration using action-focused terms:

     All right’
   Taken out of context, a form marked with action focus can have a wide range of temporal
references, from present to recent past to near future, just like any versatile tense. So, a form
r @-na-wun (sit-act.foc-1sgbas.vt) may mean ‘I am sitting down’, or ‘I have just sat down’, or
‘I am about to sit down’. Action focus does not make the verb intransitive and is thus not a
valency-changing device: as shown in examples 3.2 and 12.8, a verb marked with action focus
can take an object. Example 12.8 describes the event which triggers the developments in the
rest of this story:
12.8 [a-d@               d@-k@-d@          last ñan] ada                   ta:kw

     ‘That last son of his got married’ (lit. took a wife)
                                                                              12.2 Future       257   As we saw under D in §7.2. the object of a verb marked with action focus is likely to be
unmarked for case. Such objects have either a generic reference, or their full involvement in the
activity is irrelevant, as in 3.2, 7.4, and 12.8. This agrees with the general meaning of the action
focus.
   The action focus marker occurs with versatile tense cross-referencing markers. We can recall,
from Scheme 11.2 and §3.1, that it can only occur with basic A/S cross-referencing. It is thus
mutually exclusive with a non-subject constituent more topical than the subject. This follows
from the meaning of action focus: the action itself is more important than the participants, and
the topicality of participants is not an issue. Action focus is incompatible with the highlighting
focus marking (see §20.3).
                                         12.2 f ut ur eThe future in Manambu is marked with the suﬃx -k@-, followed by versatile tense cross-
referencing markers. The future marker can occur with the action focus marker provided
the action—rather than the participants—is focused on. Past markers do not occur with the
future. The future marker may be etymologically connected with the same-subject purposive
-k, diﬀerent-subject purposive -k@k, or the dative-aversive case -Vk (see §7.4, §13.4).
   The future form usually refers to an action or state subsequent to the speech act, as in 12.9.
Here, the object (‘key’) is the topic of a stretch of a story about how the hen and the hawk do
not get along because of a key the hen had lost. The key is masculine because it is long and
thin, and the house is feminine, because it is small.12.9 k@                  wiya-k@-d@                 ki ada

     give.to.nonthird.p-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘I will give you that (topical) key of this house’  In 12.10, the action focus marker is used, since the important point is what the participants
are going to do:12.10 an     kwa-k@-na-bran,               s@kul@k yi-ku,          a    m@n-a-p@k

      the.day.after.tomorrow coming-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
      ‘We two will stay, having cooked, then, like you, we will come the day after tomorrow’  As shown in §2.4.2, light monosyllabic verb roots have an option of marking future with the
reduplicated -k@-k@- (Table 2.4). The existence of two allomorphs depending on the syllable
weight of the verb root was discussed in §2.4.2. An example is at 12.11.12.11 na:gw sau-n yi-k@-k@-bana
      sago fry-seq go-fut-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘We will go straight away after having fried sago’   However, the marker -k@- can occasionally occur with a light verb root. The two options are
in free variation, as shown in 12.12.

      ‘I will tell another story straight away. So it is (life story) I will tell, I will tell (it)’
The reduplicated -k@- is never used with the verb k@- ‘consume (eat, drink, smoke)’: so, a form
like ∗ k@-k@-k@-bana (eat-fut-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) is ungrammatical, and k@-k@-bana
would always be used instead in the meaning of ‘we will eat (it)’. This may also be due to a rule
of loss of a voiceless velar stop discussed at A3 in §2.6.
   The future is homophonous with irrealis (§13.3). In positive clauses, the two meanings are
distinguished solely by context. But, as we will see in §13.3, the future and the epistemic, or
irrealis, meanings are formally distinguished under negation: ku-sada ma: means ‘she won’t
put’, and ak@s ku-sada-k-la means ‘she might not have put; she would not have put’ (§14.1.1
and §14.3.1). This suggests that synchronically there are two morphemes -k@-: one is marking
future, and the other one marking irrealis (§13.3).
   An example of an irrealis form is at 12.13. This was said as an explanation for why the little
girl woke up in tears. A future interpretation would not make sense here.
12.13 yig@n v@-k@-na
      dream see-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She must have seen a (bad) dream’; ∗ ‘She will see a bad dream’
   A future and an irrealis in a main clause can be ambiguous: for instance, 12.14 can mean
‘she will put (the purse) inside the bag’, or ‘she might have put (the purse) inside the bag’:
12.14 b@gam           ku-sada-k-la
      bag+lk+loc put-down-fut-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      (a) ‘She will put (the purse) inside the bag’
      (b) ‘She might have put (the purse) inside the bag’
  The overtones of future and irrealis in juxtaposed clauses are discussed in §19.1.
                                     12.3 ha b i t ua l a s p e c tThe habitual aspect is the only aspect which consistently combines with a fully inﬂected
verb. It can co-occur only with the versatile tense cross-referencing, and has the following
properties:
   r It has two forms: non-past tense marked with the suﬃx -kwa, and past marked with -yi-
     kwa-. The semantic distinction is that of non-past versus past—this is in contrast to the
     diﬀerence between the past tense and ‘versatile’ tense in non-habitual clauses which covers
     recent past, recent future, and present, and is also used in vivid narratives.
   r The non-past habitual can occur with the action focus marker, as shown in 12.17.
   r The habitual is negated with the particle ak@s which, unlike the non-habitual declarative
     negator, occurs with a fully inﬂected verb. The same categories can be expressed in positive
     and in negative habitual clauses. In contrast, negative declarative non-habitual clauses
                                                                    12.3 Habitual aspect        259     require the negator ma: accompanied by a non-inﬂected form of the verb with no person,
     gender, or number distinctions (§§14.1–2).
   r The habitual aspect does not combine with future: a future habitual meaning can only be
     expressed with a complex predicate involving the verb kwa- ‘stay’ (12.20–1).
   The habitual marker could be etymologically related to the polyfunctional verb kwa- ‘stay’
(see §17.1.1 on its use as auxiliary in aspectual complex predicates with the meaning of
prolonged durative). Synchronically, however, the habitual diﬀers from verb compounding
structures since (i) it is negated in a unique way, (ii) its past form involves an additional marker
-yi-, and (iii) it only takes the versatile tense cross-referencing markers.
   The past habitual marker could be related to the verb yi- ‘go’ or the copula verb yi- (the two
are distinguished in the ways they form imperative: see §4.2.2), or to neither of these.
   Unlike the verb kwa-, the habitual does not form an imperative, or combine with any further
modality speciﬁcations. The irregular negative habitual form of the verb ‘give’ was illustrated
in 4.38 (also see 4.37, for a regular one).
   The habitual aspect describes usual activities, as in 12.15. The versatile tense form refers to
activities not restricted to any time frame, and is frequent in generic statements, with or without
the action focus marker:
12.15 mi:ya-b@r        yap-@-m        ji-ku         ñan-ugw ata

      play-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt swings+lk+loc
      ‘Having tied two logs on the rope, children play on the swings’
  Along similar lines, 12.16 states what the snake used to do. Fish are the topic, and this is why
they have to be cross-referenced on the verb:
12.16 kami: d@ k@-kwa-da-di
      ﬁsh he eat-hab-3masc.sgsubj.p-3plbas.p
      ‘He (the snake) used to eat ﬁsh’
  In a vivid narrative about her experience living with an Australian couple, the speaker used
the non-past habitual marked with action focus, so as to highlight what her foster parents used
to do:
12.17 Harold, d@ kamna:gw-a:b k@-j@b@r t@-kwa-na-d                             a-di

      ‘Harold, he always used to eat food, too, those sugarcane, pineapple, banana, he used
      to eat things like fruit, together with his wife Kay. They then treated me correctly, like
      (their) child’
The past habitual refers to usual activities restricted to the time before the speech act, which
are no longer relevant for the present. The usual activities described in 12.18 ended just after
Australians occupied the Sepik area:
260     12 Verbal Categories12.18 aw kr@l                      da-yi-kwa-di
      then dem.prox+fem.sg+all go.down-hab.past-hab-3plbas.p/vt
      ‘They then used to go down the river here’   In 12.19 the past habitual—used in a relative clause—refers to something that is no longer
there (we will see in §14.5 and §19.2 that relative clauses have all the speciﬁcations of a main
clause, unless negated; in cases like this one they can be distinguished from juxtaposed main
clauses by intonation only).12.19 ata [kwa-yi-kwa-da-di                       kara:b]

      ‘Those (reactivated topic) men’s houses in which they used to stay were like this. Now
      they are no longer there’  A negated form of the habitual aspect is illustrated in 7.16 (also see §14.2). A future habitual
meaning can be expressed by a complex predicate consisting of the lexical verb marked with
the sequencing manner suﬃx -n and the verb kwa- ‘stay’ marked for future, as in 12.20. Such
examples may have an additional connotation of ‘staying in a place’ (rather than moving), due
to the primary meaning of the verb ‘stay’.12.20 ñ@n         a-k@s,    wun [kur@n             kwa-k@-tua]
      you.fem.sg impv-get I        take.care+seq stay-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘You get (shrimp), I will keep taking care (of the baby)’ or
      ‘You get (shrimp), I will stay taking care (of the baby) (rather than move)’   If the context excludes the connotation of ‘staying in a place’, the reading of such construc-
tions is habitual. In 12.21, the sorceress is expected to keep going back and lighting a ﬁre. There
is no connotation of ‘staying’—the verb kwa- has a purely habitual meaning.12.21 yi [taka-n kwa-k@-na]
      ﬁre put-seq stay-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She will keep lighting a ﬁre’   The habitual marker can occur with the root kwa- ‘stay’ in one grammatical word,
e.g. walim@udi waku-n kwa-kwa-da s@k@r (rainbow go.out-seq stay-hab-3masc.sgsubj.vt+
3fem.sgbas.vt time) ‘the time when the rainbow usually stays having come out’. Without a
future marker, the verb kwa- in combination with a verb marked with a sequencing -n describes
a sequence of actions—see §18.2.
   Etymologically, the habitual could well be related to the Wosera -kwa ‘vivid present’ (Wilson
1980: 68). No other Ndu language appears to use a habitual aspect marker of this shape.
                         12.4 c o m p l e t e i n vo lv e m e n t o f s / oThe suﬃx -tu- ‘all’ indicates complete involvement of S or O. That an aﬃx referring to plurality
or complete coverage of participants operates on an absolutive basis is not uncommon cross-
linguistically (Dixon 1994: 55). This suﬃx does not occur together with the habitual.
                                                              12.5 Conﬁrmation marker          261  In 12.22 and 12.72, the suﬃx marks complete involvement of numerous S.
12.22 a-di         kwasa-kwasa                    j@pis paba:n       m@di ata

      væk@r-tu-na-di
      fall-many-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Those tiny ants, black ants, centipedes all fell (into the ﬁre)’
  In 12.23, -tu- indicates that all the O were involved:
12.23 na:gw vya-wuta-tu-l@-di
      sago hit-break.in.two-many-3fem.sgsubj.p-3plbas.p
      ‘She broke all the (branches) of sago palm’
  The suﬃx -tu- refers to S of an ambitransitive verb, thus showing that it is used intransitively,
as in 12.24. We can recall, from §7.2, that gu in examples like 12.24 is part of a complex
ambitransitive verb and not its object. Not surprisingly, -tu- in 12.24 refers to people who
washed themselves fully, and not to the water:
12.24 gu    ata yaku-tu-di
      water then wash-many-3plbas.vt/p
      ‘Then they washed (fully)’
   The suﬃx -tu- is often used with verbs of aﬀect. It is likely to be cognate to the Wosera suﬃx
-to- ‘all’ (Wilson 1980: 63).
                              12.5 c o n f i r m at i o n m a r k e rThe conﬁrmation marker -@k stresses that the action or state has taken place or is happening.
This marker occupies the very last place within an inﬂected verb (see Scheme 11.2) and occurs
on verbs, and on non-verbal predicates (see Scheme 11.3), provided these have a ﬁrst or second
person subject (as in 12.25–7), or ﬁrst or second person object (as in T3.8). That is, this suﬃx
can only be used with speech act participants. In 12.25, the conﬁrmation marker goes onto a
nominal head of predicate and onto the verb in a following clause.
12.25 [takw-a-ñ@n-@k ]              [wiya:m          r@-na-ñ@n-@k ]

  When we arrived at Yuanab and asked an old lady whether she had been to church yet, she
answered:
12.26 b@ta:y-@k
      already-conf
      ‘Already indeed! (that is, I have already!)’
  In 12.5 (‘I have come’), the conﬁrmation marker co-occurs with the action focus, and in
10.60 it occurs on a verb marked with habitual aspect.
  The conﬁrmation marker can occur with future, provided the point in time is deﬁned, as in
T3.7 and T3.40 (‘today you will die’). The conﬁrmation marker occurs in rhetorical questions,
as in 12.27, but not in information questions:
262      12 Verbal Categories12.27 ñ@n        ata ata kur-ñ@n-@k?
      you.fem.sg how how do-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
      ‘What (on earth) have you done!’
  The conﬁrmation marker is not compatible with negation.
                                 12.6 c o m p l e t i v e a s p e c tCompletive aspect is marked with the suﬃx -Vm, the same as the locative case (see the
discussion at §7.11). Its meaning conveys completion of an action or total achievement of a
state. As was shown in §7.11, this marker can attach to a verbal root, as in 7.85, 12.7 (second
line), and 12.28.
12.28 a-d@                 t@p    ada                     b@

      ﬁnish-everything+compl
      ‘In this village everything was completely over’
  This same marker occurs on adjectives in the predicate slot, as in 12.29:
12.29 kuprap-@-m
      bad-lk-compl
      ‘It is irredeemably bad’
   To be used in dependent clauses or to take further person or modality expressions, the
completive form requires the support verb na- ‘copula for abstract states’. This is in contrast to
other uninﬂected verbs, which are used with the functionally unmarked support verb t@- ‘be,
stand’. The support verb occurs in main clauses if the tense and person, number and gender
speciﬁcations are required:
12.30 sa:l     yi: ma:, kwasa-kwasa                   ja:p r@p@m

      be:nat-2masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘You won’t be short (of anything), you are ﬁne as far as small things are concerned’
  The support verb is obligatory in subordinate clauses—see the second clause in 12.31. In the
ﬁrst clause of 12.31 the copula is omitted, since this is a main clause, and no extra speciﬁcations
are required: they are clear from the context.

      kind of earth away?” ’   Some nominal-like forms containing formative -Vm which cannot be omitted occur as
complements of the copula na- ‘be: natural phenomena or abstract state’. These could be
instances of fossilized completive, e.g. katelam na- ‘be light (of daylight)’, karyam na- ‘be almost
light’ (of daylight), tugwam na- ‘be clear, have clear vision’.
   The completive aspect cannot be used in commands; nor is there any form which can be
used instead. One reason for this gap is semantic: it focuses on the full completion of the
action, and commands in Manambu do not convey such meanings. The other reason is formal:
the completive aspect is an uninﬂected verb used as copula complement of the ‘abstract state’
copula na-. This copula does not have an imperative, and hardly ever occurs in commands of
any sort.
                                 12.7 c u s t o m a ry a s p e c tThe customary aspect is marked with the suﬃx -j@b@r , and means ‘usually, always or contin-
uously do’. It can head the predicate of an independent clause without a copula, if person,
number, gender, or additional aspect meanings do not have to be speciﬁed, as in 12.32 and
6.39.12.32 d@        m@r@wa          wa:l ada                        ja-j@b@r
      3masc.sg wind+lk+com rain dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg rain-cust
      ‘Rain with wind was falling customarily and continuously’In 12.17, ‘he always used to eat’, the customary form appears in the copula complement slot.
As expected, the copula, t@-, carries all the grammatical markers. A similar example is at 12.33.12.33 l@ tapwuk wuka                                   kaw r@pa-j@b@r

      t@-na
      be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘The hen is always scraping a hole (in the ground, looking for a key she’d lost)’  Unlike the habitual and the completive aspects, the customary aspect can occur in negative
and prohibitive constructions. In all such cases it has to occur with the copula t@-.12.34 yaki k@-j@b@r t@-tukwa
      smoke eat-cust be-proh.gen
      ‘Don’t keep smoking!’  A verb marked with the customary aspect can be used as a modiﬁer to an inﬂected verb:12.35 a-d@             ka:gw kur-j@b@r war@-d
      dem.dist-masc.sg drum get-cust go.up-3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘He went up always clinging (lit. getting) to the drum’If a verb carrying the marker of the customary aspect heads the predicate of a dependent clause,
the copula t@- is used—this is a typical property of an uninﬂected verb:
264       12 Verbal Categories12.36 [d@ ata k@tay          v@-j@b@r t@-ta:y]     ka:gw ata

      produce.sound+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘Then he, keeping looking around, sounded the drum’
  However, unlike any other uninﬂected verb, verbs marked with customary aspect oﬀer an
option of taking a medial clause marker directly. Examples 12.37–8 illustrate a number of
medial clause markers used this way:
12.37 v@-j@b@r-ta:y     laku-k@-tua-di
      see-cust-cotemp understand-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘Having seen (these words) all the time, I will understand them’

      k@-kwa-na-di
      eat-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt/p
      ‘After her having always ﬁnished the job (building the house), they eat food later’
  Examples like 12.37–8 are characteristic of speakers of all generations. It is unlikely that they
are a recent innovation. In male songs about foiled marriages, verbal forms marked with -j@b@r
function as fully inﬂected verbs, taking person, number, and gender marking. Example 12.39
comes from Harrison (1983: 62).
12.39 Magad@mi r@-j@brad                      p@taka:u
      (name)      sit-always+3masc.sgbas.vt/p ladder
      ‘The ladder Magad@mi is there’
  Such examples are not found in everyday speech. We can hypothesize that, in the past, verbs
with the marker -j@b@r could have been fully inﬂected, similarly to the compound verbs with
aspectual meanings discussed in §15.3.
      12.8 e x p r e s s i n g i n t e n s i v e , continuous, a n d r e p e at e d ac t i o n sIntensive and continuous actions can be marked in a variety of ways, including
    (i) one of the derivational suﬃxes discussed in §9.2—see §12.8.1;
   (ii) reduplication of the verb root—see §12.8.2, and
  (iii) repetition of the verb—see §12.8.3.","[282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291]"

          13.4.3 Same-subject and diﬀerent-subject purposive: a comparisonThroughout this section, we saw that same-subject and diﬀerent-subject purposive share a
number of properties. The two are marked with suﬃxes which could well be etymologically
related. They diﬀer in form depending on the syllable weight of the root (Table 2.4).
   In terms of their semantics, same-subject purposive and diﬀerent-subject purposive parallel
each other. We will see, in §14.3, that they are negated somewhat diﬀerently. Diﬀerent-subject
purposive is more often used in non-main clauses than the same-subject purposive. The process
of desubordination is likely to account for the uses of both same-subject and diﬀerent-subject
purposive in main clauses.
   The two forms diﬀer in a number of ways. A diﬀerent-subject purposive can only occur
in purposive complements, while same-subject purposive can occur in any dependent clause
as a copula complement (as illustrated at 13.44). Only the same-subject purposive takes part
in forming complex predicates (§17.1.2). This is a feature it shares with the desiderative -k@r,
discussed in the next section.
                                    13.5 de s i d e rat i v eDesiderative is an uninﬂected verb form marked with the suﬃx -k@r. The major meaning of
desiderative in main clauses is the desire to perform an activity, as in 13.56.
                                                                        13.5 Desiderative   29113.56 ñ@n     yi-k@r d@yawa?
      you.fem go-des they+lk+com
      ‘Do you want to go with them?’
  A similar example is at 11.9, said ironically by a woman; other examples are in T1.30, T2.12,
and T3.45. A clause containing a direct speech report with a desiderative-marked verb is a
conventional way of reporting other people’s desires and intentions. An example is at 13.57—
this was said about a 15-month-old child who could not yet talk:
13.57 di yi-k@r wa-na
      shit go-des say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She wants to shit’ (lit. she says (I) want to shit)
  In 13.58, from a letter, the same construction ‘say Verb-desiderative’ is used to refer to the
wishes of a second person:
13.58 [t@p-a:r        Apat@p-a:r       yi-k@r a
      village-lk+all Avatip-lk+all go-des dem.dist+fem.sg

      ‘(Suppose) you want to go to Avatip (lit. you say go-desiderative), if you really want to
      go this (coming) August, tell me quickly’
  Desiderative in a main clause with non-volitional predicates implies that something is to
happen, as in 13.59–60. A purposive would be inappropriate in either of these instances,
because—unlike desiderative—it implies controlled and volitional activity.
13.59 t@b g@l        war-na                             wa:l ja-k@r

      ‘It is almost one o’clock’ (lit. it is almost staying going to become one o’clock)
   Desiderative can be used to express purpose, as in 12.62 (‘They (men) surrounded (the men’s
house) fully, looking-desiderative for women’), and in 13.61. The same-subject purposive would
have been possible here, but with a diﬀerence in meaning: purposive implies deﬁnite intention
very likely to succeed, while the desiderative indicates that there is no reason to believe that
the intention will be successful. In both 12.62 and 13.61 the intended action had indeed failed:
the villagers were unable to get sago because they were attacked. That is, desiderative may have
slightly frustrative overtones.
13.61 d@y a-d@                 t@p-a     du ta:kw nagw-@k           yi-k@r aban

      put-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘These people (lit. man woman) of that village made arrangements to go get sago’
  Desiderative also occurs in complex predicates consisting of an inﬂected form of the verb
kur- ‘do, get’ preceding the desiderative, with the meaning of impending intention. This is very
292     13 Mood and Modalitysimilar to a complex predicate consisting of kur- and same-subject purposive, as in 17.15–
16. The diﬀerence in meaning is consistent with the diﬀerence between the purposive and
the desiderative: the woman’s death in 17.16 is imminent and cannot be prevented; while the
intended actions (of cats) in 13.62 can. Once again, the desiderative in a dependent clause
implies that the intention is not bound to be realized. (Also see §17.1.2.)13.62 [pusi k@-k@r kur-da-l@k]        væga-tua-di
      cat eat-des do/get-3pl-because put.inside.bag-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘Because cats might be about to eat (the foodstuﬀs) I put (the foodstuﬀs inside the
      basket)’   Just like the same-subject purposive, the desiderative can head a dependent clause; then
it has to take the polyfunctional verb t@- as support verb, as is typical for any uninﬂected
verb. Examples are at 13.63–4—semantically similar but not identical with 13.44. The speaker
said 13.63 on Friday—this is an example of future projection, corroborated by the future and
potential meaning of n@b@ ‘able, can’ (see §4.5).13.63 [fonde yi-k@r tu-ku]          n@b@ va:l                sa:n
      Monday go-des be-compl.ss able see+3fem.sgbas.p money
      ‘On Monday, after (you) are about to go, one can see about money’   This example has an overtone of indeterminacy to do with something that might, or might
not, happen in the future. (The hesitation and indeterminacy is also characteristic of the
attitude of the people to any mention of money: they do not mind accepting it as a present, but
feel shy discussing anything to do with it.)
   Example 13.64 was said to describe a picture from the same album as 13.44. The diﬀerence
was that in 13.44 the uncle was shown as embarking on a canoe, while the picture described by
13.64 only showed us preparing for an impending trip.13.64 [yi-k@r t@-da-l]                    ñ@-a
      go-des be-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p day-3fem.sgnom
      ‘This is the day they were about to go’   In summary, same-subject purposive implies controlled activity and intention which is
bound to come to fruition. In contrast, the desiderative expresses non-controlled activities
(such as time and weather) and activities which are desirable but may or may not take place.
   A clause with a desiderative can be used as a complementation strategy, as in 13.65. This
describes a prohibition on marrying women from the same clan as oneself:13.65 [awarwa    ta:kw kra-k@r] a                     n@ma         apaw
      each.other woman take-des dem.dist+fem.sg big.fem.sg old.fem.sg
      va:l-a
      taboo-3fem.sgnom
      ‘Wanting to marry each other’s women is a big strong (lit. old) taboo’   The desiderative marker may, or may not, be related to the purposive. Its most likely cognate
is the Iatmul marker -k1t, which functions as an indirect object case on nouns and as a verbal
purposive (Brugnowi dialect: Staalsen n.d.a).
                                                                         13.6 Frustrative      293                                     13.6 f rus t rat i v eFrustrative indicates that the action was done to no avail—that is, the desired result was not
achieved. Frustrative is an uninﬂected verb, but, unlike other uninﬂected verbs, frustrative
makes a distinction between durative and non-durative action. Durative frustrative is marked
with the suﬃx -p on the verb stem and repetition of the frustrative form. This indicates that the
action which failed to achieve the result took place over a lengthy period of time—as in 13.66.
The form can be repeated from two to ﬁve times, but hardly ever more than that. The more
times the form is repeated, the lengthier the failed attempt is supposed to be. The repeated
frustrative-marked verbs form one intonation unit, and no other constituent can intervene
between them.
   A clause containing a frustrative form is typically accompanied by another clause indicating
either why the action failed, as in 13.66, or what was done after it failed, as in 13.67 and T3.31.13.66 lagu-p lagu-p lagu-p suan         yi-na
      pull-fr pull-fr pull-fr diﬃcult go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘(He) pulled and pulled and pulled (the canoe out of mud) in vain, it was hard’  Like any uninﬂected verb, the durative frustrative can only occur in a dependent clause as a
copula complement of t@-, as in 13.67 and T3.29. Then there is only one copula no matter how
many times the durative frustrative form is repeated—this is an argument in favour of treating
the durative frustrative as one predicate, and not as repetition of several predicates:13.67 [d@ asa:y war-d@-l                             wiya:r]          [kap@-n r@-p r@-p

      ‘The father went up into the house, having sat and sat and sat and sat waiting in vain,
      having said, “oh”, he went down’   The non-durative frustrative is marked with -yak@p. This form contains no indication as to
how long the frustrated attempt had lasted. The form is usually not repeated. We can recall,
from §2.4.2, that -yak@p is syllable-weight sensitive. If a verb root has a CV(C)V, a CVC, or a
CCV/CVC structure, the form of the marker is -yak@p, as in kwak@-yak@p (look.for-fr) ‘look
for in vain’, kayket@-yak@p ‘hold onto something in vain’, gra-yak@p ‘cry in vain’. If a verb
consists of a CV, the frustrative suﬃx undergoes initial CVCV reduplication, as in ya-yak@-
yak@p (come-red-fr) ‘come in vain’, v@-yak@-yak@p ‘look in vain; be unable to see’. The verb
v@- ‘see’ is unusual in that it has an alternative non-durative frustrative form v@-k@tak@p—this
is illustrated below. This alternative form ﬁts in with the iambic stress pattern characteristic of
weight-sensitive suﬃxes—see §2.4.2.13.68 v@-yak@-yak@p væ:n      r@-da-l

done twice.

  If a verb contains -ya ‘come’ as the last syllable, the frustrative -yak@p is ‘shortened’ to -k@p,
as in 13.71. Such haplology is unusual.

  Like any uninﬂected verb, a frustrative -yak@p can only be used in a dependent clause as a
copula complement:

      ‘Having looked for me in vain, having packed my things, by entering (inside the bush)
      they hid them together with their things’
  The two frustrative markers may well be etymologically related: they share the formative -p.
We can hypothesize that -yak@- in -yak@p could be related to -yak@- ‘do fully’ (see §15.3.1), and
that -k@ta- in v@-k@tak@p could be linked to -k@ta- ‘try’, as in k@-k@ta ‘try eating’. However,
these hypotheses require further substantiation.
  Unlike the other modal forms discussed so far, neither of the frustratives can be negated.
        13.7 no m i na l i zat i o n s m a r k e d w i t h dat i v e -av e r s i v e c a s eWe saw in §9.1.1 (under II) that deverbal nominalizations marked with the dative-aversive case
-Vk express a variety of modal meanings to do with future projection, unrealized wishes, weak
probability, or events to be prevented from happening. When used in the predicate slot, these
nominalizations behave like any uninﬂected verb; examples are at 13.73–5.

   In 13.74, the ﬁrst occurrence of dative-aversive-marked nominalization expresses a wish. This
is a typical meaning of the dative-aversive case (see §7.4). The second occurrence of dative-
aversive-marked nominalization is ambiguous: we recall, from §13.4.1, that these forms are

(as in T3.40, third line, and 13.74) can be interpreted either as a dative-aversive nominalization,
meaning ‘might stay’, or as same-subject purposive, meaning ‘going to stay’. The ambiguity
can be resolved by the context, and under negation (see §14.3).

   Dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations may express weak probability, both in ques-
tions and in statements. In 13.75, a grandmother is desperately looking for her two grandchil-
dren, asking in every men’s house in Avatip village:

  Nominalizations are also used in rhetorical questions:

      then now who give.to.third.p-red-dat eh?
      ‘Then now (after everything bad he did to us), who is going to give him (things), eh?’
   Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used as clausal complements in contexts which
would require the dative-aversive case on a noun phrase. These include verbs with a negative
meaning, e.g. ‘feel shame’, as in 9.6, ‘say no’, or ‘forbid, refuse’, as in 9.5 and 13.78 (cf. also
10.35), ‘forget’, as in 13.79, ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 9.9 and 13.80, and ‘be unwilling’ (lit. go for
little), as in 13.81.

can precede or follow the main (inﬂected) verb.

      ‘If one has a garden close (to the village), they might steal (vegetables from it)’  A dative-aversive nominalization on its own may have an apprehensive meaning, just like
dative-aversive case forms (see §7.4):13.86 kiya-kiya-k
      die-red-dat
      ‘(Do not go there) lest you die!’  The aversive use of dative-aversive-marked nominalizations in main clauses is another
instance of desubordination of verb forms which are predominantly used in dependent clauses.
  In all the cases discussed above, dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations occupy the
second argument slot of a verb. They can also occupy the S slot of a non-verbal predicate
with a negative meaning, as shown in 13.87. This sentence states a convention concerning
men’s road and women’s road in Avatip. (A corresponding positive statement would require a
ø-marked nominalization: see §9.1.1.) A noun phrase marked with dative-aversive case cannot
be used this way. Examples like 13.87 oﬀer an argument in favour of considering fully redupli-
cated verbs marked with the suﬃx -k as separate modal forms which are homonymous, rather
than polysemous, with a dative-aversive (-Vk) case form of a deverbal action nominalization.
                                                                        13.8 Summary        29713.87 k@ta-n-ab         [ñan-a-d@      t@p    ta:kw du-a-yab@r                 yi-ya:k]

   What I call dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are obligatorily used in an additional
type of dependent conditional clause introduced by the adverb k@pa:b ‘in case’ (most probably,
terminative case of k@p ‘just’). The meaning of such clauses is ‘in case VERB’ as in 13.88.
Unlike the examples above (especially 13.84–5), the verb does not have to have any negative
connotations.
13.88 kusu-n ap              k@pa:b r@p@-r@p-@k
      wear-seq impv+see in.case be.enough-red-dat
      ‘Try it (dress) on, just in case it ﬁts’ or ‘to see if it ﬁts’
   Such forms are identical to dative-aversive nominalizations. However, like any non-main
clause forms they require a suﬃxed negator -ma:r-, albeit in a somewhat diﬀerent form (see
§14.3 and §14.5.1). The ways in which nominalizations are negated are discussed in §14.3.3.
This is an argument in favour of the reduplicated verbs marked with -k in ‘in case’ clauses
being special modal forms, homonymous with other, seemingly identical, forms.
                                           13.8 s ummaryManambu is rich in modal forms. The imperative mood has three person sub-paradigms which
diﬀer from each other in their form, function, and semantics. The optative modality can be
formed on imperative, and on the irrealis.
   The pervasive problem in distinguishing tenses and modalities in Manambu is that of
polysemy versus homophony. We have already discussed similar problems with cases, and will
return to the same problem in the lexicon, in Chapter 21. The irrealis forms are homophonous
with future, and can only be formally distinguished under negation. Same-subject purposive is
homophonous with dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations of light monosyllabic verbs;
again, the two are negated diﬀerently.
   Dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations are used in main clauses, and as clausal com-
plements. Their lookalikes express condition in dependent clauses meaning ‘in case (something
happens)’—that these are diﬀerent forms can only be seen in the ways they are negated.
   The use of same- and diﬀerent-subject purposives in main clauses involves the process of
desubordination. The same process appears to be at work with dative-aversive case-marked
nominalizations used in an apprehensive meaning, that is, as warnings.
   The desiderative modality is relatively unproblematic in terms of its semantics. In contrast,
frustrative oﬀers a choice between durative and non-durative, absent from any other modality.
Frustrative is the only modality which cannot be negated.
         14         Negation
Manambu has a highly complicated system of negation. The choice of a negative form cor-
relates with the tense, aspect, mood, and modality value of the clause, and with clause type.
We saw above that negation is often the only means of distinguishing otherwise homophonous
verb forms, and clause types.           14.1 ne gat i o n o f d e c la rat i v e n o n- h a b i t ua l c laus e sAll declarative non-habitual clauses are negated with the negator ma:. Just as in positive
clauses, verbal predicates diﬀer from non-verbal predicates in what tense distinctions are
expressed under negation (see §12.1). Negation of verbal predicates (including copulas) is
discussed in §14.1.1. In §14.1.2 we look at how non-verbal predicates are negated.
   The verbal negator ma: (variants: ma:n, ma""an, ma""a) has clausal scope, and is also used as
a pro-clause meaning ‘no’. The forms ma: and ma""a are in free variation; and so are ma:n and
ma""an (see §2.1.2). The variants ma: and ma:n are in free distribution in most instances, with
the variant ma:n found only with traditional and older speakers. The only noted diﬀerence
between the two is discussed under §14.1.2 (example 14.15). Additional uses of the negator ma:
are discussed in §14.6. See the discussion in §14.1.3.","[317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325]"

                                 13.2.3 Optative modalityThe optative modality is used to express wishes, hoped for and often diﬃcult to accomplish.
Optative can be formed on ﬁrst and third person imperative with the marker -@u. This same
marker can occur on the irrealis forms discussed in §13.3 with a similar meaning (examples
13.29–40). Second person irrealis accompanied with the marker -@u is used to ﬁll in the gap in
the optative paradigm formed on the imperative. The marker -@u triggers the allomorph -l of
the third person feminine form (see §5.1.2). The ﬁrst person singular imperative marker -u is
realized as -@w before the optative -@u, as in 13.30.
  The optative refers to actions in present and in future, but not in the past. On a particularly
hot and windless day Mali expressed a wish that:13.29 ma:r vya-kwa-l-@u
      wind hit-impv.3p-fem.sg-opt
      ‘I wish the wind could blow’
284     13 Mood and ModalityThe optative can be accompanied by an interjection: Žsa ‘attention getter; oh dear’ or Žsay ‘oh
dear’, as in 13.30–1.
13.30 Žsay pap@r vyakat-a ma:j wuk@w-@u
       oh later good-lk story hear+1sgimpv-opt
       ‘I wish I could hear good news later’
  In 13.31, Gemaj, fed up with waiting for a plane to come, exclaimed:
13.31 Žsa a                  balus yabi:b da-kwa-l-@u
       oh dem.dist.fem.sg plane quickly go.down-impv.3p-fem.sg-opt
       ‘Oh, I wish the plane could descend quickly!’
  The optative can be used in maledictions, without implying an actual wish. A mother,
exasperated by annoying behaviour of a child, may exclaim 13.32, without actually wishing
the child dead. This is a more expressive version of 13.28.
13.32 m@y-a-m@yab             kiya-kwa-l-@u
      real-lk-real+lk+term die-impv.3p-fem.sg-opt
      ‘May she well and truly die!’
  Optative cannot be negated; a negative form of the irrealis (§13.3) is used instead. That is,
the subtle distinction between optative and irrealis is neutralized in negative constructions.
This agrees with the principle of dependencies between grammatical systems whereby fewer
categories may be distinguished in negative than in positive clauses (Aikhenvald and Dixon
1998).
                                       13.3 i r r e a l i sIn our discussion of the future in §12.2, we pointed out that, in non-negative main clauses, it
is homophonous with a form termed irrealis. As shown in 12.13–14, a verb form marked with
future -k@- can have a wide array of epistemic meanings, referring to something that is probably
happening, or might happen, or might have happened. Whether a form marked with -k@- has
an irrealis or a future meaning is often determined by the context (they are diﬀerentiated under
negation). In 13.33, a future meaning is highly unlikely: on hearing a cry, a woman suspects it
could be her baby daughter crying:
13.33 wun kwasa           ñan gra-k-na
      I    small.fem.sg child cry-irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Perhaps my little daughter is crying’
The irrealis form is used in warnings, as in 13.34. I was told not to go and bathe in the ﬂooded
and muddy Sepik River, because:
13.34 piñu-k-ñ@na                           karki
      slip-irr-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt mud
      ‘You might slip in the mud’
   The irrealis form is often used in juxtaposed clauses with counterfactual meanings (see §19.1,
and further examples there). An example of a counterfactual use of irrealis in an independent
clause is at 13.35 (continuation of 10.124). Kukelyabau is talking about a ﬁre during the Second
World War when a plane (the ﬁrst one she’d ever seen) crashed into the village: as soon as the

      stay-irr-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Since it (plane) went down, this is why we left our houses. OK. We left our houses, this
      is why there is a line (of descendants) in this village. We are multiplying, we men and
      women of this village. This is why we stay creating descendants (lit. putting line). Before
      we would have ﬁnished, we would have died, we would never have been here’
  In positive clauses, the future and the irrealis meanings are distinguished solely by context.
Under negation, however, the future and the epistemic meanings are distinguished formally:
future negation involves the negator ma: postposed to the uninﬂected root, while irrealis
negation involves ak@s with a fully inﬂected verb, as shown in the last two lines of 13.35 (see
further discussion in §§14.2–3). Another example is at 13.36, where irrealis forms appear in a
counterfactual conditional construction, both in the dependent clause and in the main clause:
13.36 [m@n       an-a-d@          ñaj             t@-k@-m@na]
      you.masc 1du-lk-masc.sg father’s.brother be-irr-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [an-a:k         atawa    ak@s     kur@-k-m@na-bran]
      we.du-lk+dat like.that neg.irr do/get-irr-2masc.sgsubj.vt-1dubas.vt
      ‘If you had been our uncle, you would not have acted like this to us’
  Irrealis forms can be used as command strategies. Their illocutionary force is milder than
that of prohibitives—they sound more like a strong wish than a proper order, as in 13.37–8:
13.37 kap ak@s      da-k-na-ñ@n
      alone neg.irr go.down-fut-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘May you not go down alone (to the toilet at night)’
13.38 wa:l s@r         ak@s    ja-k-na
      rain tomorrow neg.irr fall-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘May it not rain tomorrow!’
   To express a desire for something hardly attainable, the optative marker -@u is attached to the
irrealis form. Such forms only occur in main clauses. Third person feminine marker preceding
-@u is -l, just like with the optative discussed in §13.2.3. In 13.39, the speaker wished the frog
could frighten her naughty daughter and keep her quiet for a few minutes:
13.39 kra kra kra wa-k-na-l-@u
      kra kra kra say-fut-act.foc-3fem.sgbas.vt-opt
      ‘(I wish) (the frog) could say kra kra kra’
286     13 Mood and Modality  Optative irrealis forms are negated with ak@s, just like the irrealis forms in 13.35–6. In 13.40,
Mali wished that it should not rain on us when we go to Swakap, notwithstanding black clouds
gathering on the horizon:
13.40 wa:l ak@s       ja-k-na-l-@u
      rain neg.irr fall-fut-act.foc-3fem.sgbas.vt-opt
      ‘I wish it did not rain!’
The diﬀerence in meaning between 13.38 and 13.40 is subtle: the desire in 13.40 is likely to be
less attainable than that in 13.38. This agrees with general overtones of the optative marker in
Manambu.
                                      13.4 p ur p o s i v eThe purposive modality is used in main and in dependent clauses to express intention and
purpose. It distinguishes same-subject (§13.4.1) and diﬀerent-subject forms (§13.4.1). Same-
subject forms are uninﬂected verbs, and diﬀerent-subject forms are partially inﬂected. This
accords with the general principle operating throughout the language: that same-subject verbs
are not marked for subject, and diﬀerent-subject verbs are (see Table 11.1, and Chapter 18). In
§13.4.3, we compare the ‘same-subject’ and ‘diﬀerent-subject’ purposive in terms of how they
are used.","[310, 311, 312, 313]"

                          19.5.5 Syntactic role of speech reportsThe role of direct and of indirect speech report in multiclausal speech report constructions
depends on the transitivity of the reporting verb. A reporting verb may be intransitive, transi-
tive, or even ditransitive (see Munro 1982: 304–5, and discussion in Aikhenvald 2008).
   The verb wa- ‘say’ is the only verb in Manambu consistently used to introduce and frame
speech reports. This verb is rather unusual in its transitivity patterns. Unlike any other verb
(including the other two verbs of speech, bla- and yi-, discussed in §21.1.3) it appears in a
variety of frames.
                                                                   19.5 Speech reports       489A. wa- ‘say’ as a ditransitive verb can appear in two frames.
  First, the verb wa- can take two NP objects meaning ‘telling someone something’, or ‘telling
someone about something’. Its second argument is an addressee. The object (as in 19.1) or the
addressee (as in 19.59) can be cross-referenced in the second position if appropriate.
19.59 ñan-a             t@p-a-ma:j       wa-k@-tua-digur-@k
      we-lk+fem.sg village-lk-story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt-2plbas.vt-conf
      ‘I will tell you (many) our village tale’
   A similar example is in T2.67. We will see, in §19.8, that wa- in this usage can occur with
a headless relative clause in the O slot used as a complementation strategy. The object is
questioned with agwa ja:p ‘what?’ (see §10.4) used to question direct objects of any kind
(cf. example 10.84). The verb wa- can also mean ‘promise’, and is then used ditransitively.
The thing ‘promised’ is the object, which can also be questioned with agwa ja:p ‘what?’
19.60 [l@-k@-k      wa-tu-di               ja:p]
      she-obl-dat say-1sgsubj.p-3plbas.p thing
      k@dika-n-adika
      dem.prox.react.top+pl-pred-react.top+pl
      ‘Here are the things I promised her’
   Secondly, the verb wa- as ditransitive verb can occur with a name in what looks like an object
slot, and the object or person named as a second argument, as in T2.3 (‘those whom we call
Gala’) and in T2.18 (this (man) by that name of Kamkudi), 19.12, and 19.76. In 19.61, it is
used with a reciprocal awarwa in the meaning of ‘address each other as (name)’.
19.61 ñamus           ma:m          awarwa wa-na-b@r
      younger.sibling elder.sibling rec     say-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘They two address each other as siblings’ (lit. say younger sibling elder sibling to each
      other)
  The object or person named can be cross-referenced on the verb, and questioned either with
agwa ja:p ‘what?’, or s@ ‘who?’ (see §10.4). In contrast, the name is never cross-referenced on
the verb. It is questioned with ata ‘how?’, just like NP objects in the examples discussed at B
below, and direct speech reports.
B. wa- ‘say’ as a transitive verb can take an NP object if the NP is something being said, e.g.
‘verse’ in 10.113, or a wrong word in 19.62a. A young girl instructed an older speaker not to
use a Tok Pisin word:
19.62a lukautim wa-tukwa
       lukautim say-proh.gen
       ‘Do not say lukautim!’
  It can also be used in describing ways of pronouncing a word, as in 19.62b:
19.62b [n@k@-di ta:kw sajagalavi wa-kwa-na-di]             [n@k@-di ta:kw sag@lawi
       other-pl woman sajagalawi say-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt other-pl woman sag@lawi
       wa-kwa-na-di]             wun saw@ngalawi wa-kwa-na-un
       say-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt I   saw@ngalawi say-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘Other women pronounce (lit. say) sajagalawi, other women say sag@lawi, I say
       saw@galawi’
490      19 Other Dependent ClausesThe word for language, kudi, as the object of wa- refers to a typical sound made
by a non-human, e.g. kudi aka wa-na (language dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg speak-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she (the pot with water boiling) is making a sound’, or t@b kudi wa-na
(sky language speak-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘thunder is sounding’ (lit. sky speaks language).
Alternatively, the sound itself can be reproduced, as in 19.63:
19.63 tapwuk [p@kaka:u]          ada                            wa:d
      rooster cockadoodledoo dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg say+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘The rooster said: “cock-a-doodle-doo” ’, or ‘The rooster sang’
In this use, the verb wa- allows for cross-referencing the addressee, or the time, or the manner
as appropriate, and also the object NP referring to what’s being said. What is being said can be
questioned with ata ‘how’. This is similar to direct speech reports—see C below.
  The verb wa- forms a number of idiomatic collocations with interjections and adverbs, e.g.
ay wa- (ay say-) ‘let know’, ya:k wa- or ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree, accept; say OK’. The
combination vyak@ta wa- (good say) means ‘approve’, and ma: wa- means ‘refuse; reject’. These
are lexicalized: the meaning of the whole is not easily deducible from the meanings of the parts.
And the component in the speech report slot cannot be questioned.
  A reported command cast as purposive indirect speech report is a purposive clause, of
the type discussed in §19.4 above (see 19.54). It occupies the object slot of the verb wa- as
a transitive verb. If the content of a reported command has to be questioned, ata is used.
Alternatively, a constituent within a purposive clause can be questioned as appropriate (see
§10.4). The ﬁrst person imperative-permissive wa:u ‘may I talk?’ is used intransitively, as a
turn-taking device.
C. wa- ‘say’ with a direct speech report: transitive or ditransitive?
  A direct speech report cannot be considered a direct object of the verb wa- since it can never
be cross-referenced on this verb, and has to be questioned with the adverbial interrogative ata
‘how’ or its reduplicated version ata ata. The question at 19.64 can be answered with 19.61,
19.62a–b, or 19.53:
19.64 ata (ata) wa-na?
      how       say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘What did she say?’
  The same question word can be used to question the sound made by a rooster in 19.63.
  An adverbial demonstrative ‘thus’ is used to anaphorically refer to a speech report:
19.65 [mæy, mæy] k@tawa wa-na
      come, come like.this say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘ “Come, come”, this is what she said’ (lit. like this she said)
Addressee, time, manner can be cross-referenced on the verb of speech accompanied by a direct
speech report, as in T1.23, T2.7, and T1.26 (see §3.1, for the discussion of cross-referencing).
The speech report can never be cross-referenced.
   We can thus conclude that direct speech report is not a prototypical object. However, it
is obligatory, and therefore is to be considered a core argument of the verb ‘say’. It is best
considered a special grammatical relation.
   The transitivity patterns described in this section only apply to the underived verb wa-. When
accompanied by directionals, or when used as ﬁrst component in verb compounds, wa- can be
used either transitively or ditransitively, like any other verb which displays this transitivity
alternation (see §4.2.2 and Chapters 15 and 16).
                                                                   19.5 Speech reports       491                      19.5.6 Polysemous patterns in speech reportsIn many languages, especially in the New Guinea area, speech reports express a variety of
meanings beyond mere reporting of what someone else had actually said (see the survey in
Aikhenvald 2008). The following meanings are expressed by direct speech reports.
I. Internal speech and thought are cast as direct speech reports, as in T3.28 (‘think, hope’).
An alternative is to use the expression maw@la:m wa- (inside+lk+loc say) ‘think, say to
oneself’. The semantics of mawul is discussed in §21.4.
19.66 [k@                ta:kw kra-k@-tua]
      dem.prox+fem.sg woman marry/bring-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [m@wulam        ada                    wa-na-d]
      inside+lk+loc dem.top+masc.sg say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘He said to himself (lit. in his mind/inside), “I will marry this woman” ’
II. Desires and intentions of non-first person are expressed as direct speech reports. A
speech report typically contains a same-subject purposive, as in 19.67, or a desiderative, as in
13.57–8 (also see 19.58a).
19.67 [kayik         kur@k]           [wa-na]
      picture/image do/get+purp.ss say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She wants or intends to take pictures’
  If intention is expressed with a loan from Tok Pisin (pait ‘hit’), it appears uninﬂected, as in
19.68—a threat to a naughty baby to make her stop crying lest Tedison whom she was thought
to be afraid of might hit her.
19.68 Tedison [pait] [wa-k-na-d]
      Tedison hit    say-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘(Calm down), Tedison intends to hit you’
  An alternative is employing an inﬂected clause as a speech report, as in 19.69, or a noun in
the dative case as in 19.70.
19.69 pusi væn        t@-na-d                        [pap@r
      cat see+seq stand-act.foc-3masc.sg.bas.vt later
      k@-k@-tua]                          wa-na-d
      eat-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘The cat is and has been looking (at the duckling), he wants to eat her later (lit. he says
      “I will eat her later” ’
19.70 diya:k        wa-na
      shit+lk+dat say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She wants to have a shit’ (said about a 1-year-old baby who could not talk yet, but
      whose intentions were clear)
None of these examples involves an actual speech act. As I was coming downstairs with a
loaded camera (without saying anything), 19.67 was said by a speaker to make sure the girls
whose pictures I was to take were ready. Tedison (mentioned in 19.68) had no idea that his
name had been used to cajole the little baby into behaving herself. The baby mentioned in
13.67 could not talk yet—so her desire to have a poo could not have been expressed verbally.
492     19 Other Dependent ClausesAnd cats do not talk—the cat’s intentions in 19.69 were clear from the way it looked at the
duckling.
III. Reason, cause, and purpose are expressed as direct speech reports. Example 19.71 did not
involve any speech acts. This was an answer to a child’s question about why her mother had
gone out:19.71 [wus-a:k     wa-ku]        [aka
      pee-lk+dat say-compl:ss dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
      waku-na]
      go.out-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She has gone out because of (desire to) pee’ (lit. ‘saying “because of pee” she went out’)  And 16.81 explains the intentions of 9-month-old baby who could not yet talk.
  We saw, at §16.2.2, that speech reports are one of the biclausal causative strategies; examples
are at 16.84, 13.24–5, and T2.34.
IV. Apprehensives can be expressed as direct speech reports. In 19.72 a speech report with an
apprehensive meaning contains an irrealis form meaning ‘might’ (see §13.3):19.72 [aw yaga-di]             [a-di          du-aba:b aw [a-di             a:s
      then be.scared-3plbas.p dem.dist-pl man-too then dem.dist-pl dog
      vya-k@-dana-dian]             wa-ku]
      hit-irr-3plsubj.vt-1plbas.vt say-compl:ss
      ‘So they were afraid, men too, lest the dogs might hit them (lit. having said “Those dogs
      might hit us” )’V. The end result of counting is usually expressed as direct speech report, as in 19.73 and
T2.21. Neither of these contains an actual speech report: the child we were talking about in
19.73 did not speak Manambu and was too shy to speak in the presence of a white woman
anyway.19.73 nabi a:li wa:d
      year four say+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘He is 4’ (lit. ‘he says four’)We have seen that speech reports do not have to imply a speech act. However, there are two
major diﬀerences between speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act and those
reports that do.
   First, a direct speech report can precede or follow the reporting verb (as we saw in §19.5.1
above) only if the actual speaking took place. If a speech report is used to express any of
the meanings detailed in I–V in this section, it always has to precede the verb ‘say’. Reported
commands as indirect speech reports also have to precede the verb of speech.
   Secondly, speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act tend not to be introduced
by a speech introducer ata ‘then’ (see Aikhenvald 2008).
   An additional way of making clear that a speech act has actually taken place is by using a
‘framing’ construction illustrated in 19.51. Then, if a speech report follows the framing clause,
another framing clause is often added at the end of the speech report of the kind ‘they said
[Speech Report] having said’. A typical example is at 19.74:
                                                19.6 Clause linking involving connectives       49319.74 [wa:l ja-k-na-d]                             [wa-tu@-l]                    [wa-ku],
      rain rain-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt say-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p say-compl:ss
      [ata wa:d],                   [ma:] [j@ ma:] [wa-ku]
      then say+3masc.sgbas.p no           rain neg say-compl:ss
      ‘ “It will rain”, I said saying, then he said, “No, it won’t rain”, having said’
   A speech report which does not imply a speech act cannot be used in such a ‘framing’
construction. Neither can the verb wa- in any of its ditransitive or transitive usages without
a direct speech report; nor if it is used in one of the lexicalized collocations, such as ma: wa-
‘refuse, reject’ or ya:kya wa- ‘agree’.
   Framing constructions are very frequent. They also appear in speech reports in the local
Tok Pisin: one frequently hears a dialogue being reported using a quote frame na em i tok
olsem na em i tok (and he said thus and he said). This apparent redundancy serves a purpose:
it distinguishes speech acts as speech acts from their metaphorical extensions.
                  19.6 c lause linking involving connectivesConnectives involved in linking clauses occupy clause-initial position. Connectives do not
occur in any of the medial clauses discussed in Chapter 18, or dependent clauses in this chapter.
The connective a-l@-k ‘because; this is why’ is an exception: it can occur in a causal clause (as in
19.75). This connective derives from that-fem.sg-DAT ‘for that’ and is employed only if explicit
statement of reason is appropriate:
19.75 [l@ wuk@mar-la]                              [al@k        ma:
      she forget-3fem.sgsubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p this.is.why again
      wa-tua,                           a                    ma:j]
      say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt dem.dist+fem.sg story
      ‘She forgot (it), this is why I am telling it again, the story’
   A similar example is at 4.16. Alternatively, the connective al@k can be used within a causal
clause, as in 19.76. This is an explanation as to why there is no men’s road and women’s road
in Malu village.
19.76 [al@k m@ya numa-di k@p            r@-ma:r-da-l@k]         [ [du-a-ya:b
      so     real big-pl      ground sit-neg.sub-3pl-because man-lk-road

      woman+lk-road say-seq small+fem.sg stay-compl.ss already hard

      go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘So since they do not occupy really big territory, since what is called men’s and women’s
      road is small, it is diﬃcult (to have them)’
In T1.16 al@k occurs after the subject wun ‘I’, since the subject is fronted as part of a topical-
ization strategy (see §20.2). This connective can link sentences as well as clauses as in 18.25,
and T1.22. It often occurs in a main clause preceded by a medial causal clause, as in 18.49 and
19.77, or by another medial clause, as in 18.52.
19.77 [d@ da-d@-l@k],                   [(al@k)      wi     waku-dian]
      he go.down-3masc.sg-because this.is.why house go.out-1plbas.p
      ‘Since it (plane) went down, [this is why] we left our houses’
494      19 Other Dependent Clauses   We recall, from §18.7, that the connective al@k and the causal medial clause marker -l@k share
their etymology: both come from a dative-marked feminine form of the functionally unmarked
distal demonstrative a-.
   We saw in §18.3 that the medial clause form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a
conjunction ‘thus, and so’ when it follows another medial clause (see 18.28). This form is indeed
in the process of grammaticalization as part of a conjunction: al@k t@-ku (dem.dist.fem.sg+dat
stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so, as a result’. It is pronounced as one
phonological word. This connective does not occur with causal clauses. An example is in 19.78:
19.78 [sana:k           karab@         ja:p kui-taka-dana-di]
      money+lk+dat men’s.house+lk thing give.to.third.p-put-3plsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      [al@k       t@-ku        ma: t@]
      this.is.why be-compl.ss neg have.neg
      ‘They (the neighbouring group) gave away the things from men’s house for money, this
      is why they do not have (them anymore)’
  The connective aw ‘and then; so; but’ links clauses and sentences. Its meaning may involve
contrast, as in 19.79:
19.79 [vyak@ta-d],         [aw          wun ñan ma: t@],          [a-d@-r@b

      ‘He (the foundling) is nice, and (surprise, surprise: unlike any normal woman) I don’t
      have a child, (so) let’s look right after this one’
   It occurs as a sentence linker in T2.5–6, and T2.8–9. Also see 19.72 for its sequential
meaning. When repeated, it refers to alternating actions, as in aw yi-n aw ya-n (and.then
go-seq and.then come-seq) ‘on the one hand coming, on the other hand going’ (T3.18). A
similar example, aw war-@n aw da-n (then go.up-seq then go.down-seq) ‘alternately going up
and coming down’ is in T2.8. This same form can link noun phrases, e.g. aw kami: aw lau-lap
(then ﬁsh then ripe-banana) ‘(we eat) sometimes ﬁsh sometimes banana’ (or both).
   The connective a ‘then, as a result’ has a sequential meaning, as in T2.3 and 19.4. It can link
dependent clauses, as in T3.18 where it is similar to aw. It may have an adversative meaning,
roughly translatable as ‘but’, as in 10.22b. The form a probably comes from the feminine distal
demonstrative ‘that’.
   Connectives which link sentences within a paragraph are ata ‘then’, and atawata:y (from ata
wa-ta:y ‘then say-cotemp’) ‘and so then, in summary, this is why’. The latter is a result of a
recent grammaticalization of ata and a medial clause form of ‘say’. The semantic development
is congruent with the use of wa- ‘say’ to express reason (see §19.5.6). The connective atawata:y is
often used without reference to an actual speech act, as in 18.33 where the speaker talks about
how the Avatip people lived during the Second World War when they had to hide from the
Japanese invaders. Or it may refer cataphorically or anaphorically to an actual speech report,
as in 19.80:

      say-3plsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Thus/this way they lied to him about women (lit. put woman-lie to him), “You will
      marry a woman, we will give you a young woman”, thus they said to him’   The connective ata often introduces speech reports which imply actual speech, as can be
seen throughout the texts at the end of this grammar. It typically precedes the verb and never
occurs on the ﬁrst sentence in a text (see examples 4.12 and T1.1, T1.8, T1.10, and T1.12). In
the third clause of T1.12 the connective ata is placed after the imperative verb ‘go’; this adds
to the urgency of the command.
   Ata can intervene between parts of numerous multiword constituents involving verbs (for
instance, complex predicates: see §17.1–5, and negative constructions: see Chapter 14).
   The question of whether the form ata meaning ‘how; thus’ and ata as a negator of desider-
ative and same-subject purposive (see §14.3.2) are related to each other and to the connective
ata remains open. Several instances of ata in its diﬀerent meanings do not occur; we can recall,
from §10.4, that a repeated form ata ata has just the interrogative meaning ‘how?’
   When used in the predicate slot or as part of predicate focus, ata ‘connective’ and ata ‘thus,
how’ take the predicate marker -n (see §10.2.3 on its occurrence with reactivated topic-marking
demonstratives), as in 4.79 and 10.103. No other connective can be focused or head a predicate.
   The connective k@pa:b ‘in case’ introduces dependent conditional clauses discussed at §13.7
and §18.8 (examples 13.88, and 18.52). This connective is most probably a terminative case form
of k@ p ‘just’ (§21.2.2). Just like any other connective, k@pa:b occupies a clause-initial position.                        19.7 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f m a i n c laus e sSeveral main clauses can be juxtaposed to one another. Such juxtaposed main clauses do
not have a special rising intonation contour characteristic of dependent juxtaposed clauses
discussed at §19.1. There is usually a short pause between the clauses. Juxtaposition of clauses
has the following semantic eﬀects.
I. A subsequent clause oﬀers a comment or a clariﬁcation to the preceding clause, elaborating
on it. Examples include 19.79, and also 19.9, 19.29, 14.11, 14.12, 14.53, 14.95, 14.97, 14.104, and
T1.9, T1.19–20, T1.22, and T1.28. A similar example is at 19.81: Kuk@lyabau was explaining
that she was a little girl when the Second World War broke out. The fourth clause provides
additional information to the third clause.19.81 [wun a                   taim numa         ñan ma: t@]         [war

      ‘I was not a big child that time, (time when) the war came. I was not a big child, I was a
      small child, then the war came’
496     19 Other Dependent Clauses   A subsequent clause often rephrases the preceding clause, as in 14.50. This serves as a
rhetorical device, to make sure the hearer understands the point made. Similar examples come
from beginnings and endings of stories—this can be seen in T1.35, T2.68, and T3.1.
II. A subsequent clause oﬀers an alternative, or a correction, to the preceding clause, as in
14.102 and 14.105. If the subsequent clause is cast in irrealis (see §13.3), it acquires an appre-
hensive meaning—that is, is understood as a warning against something negative. Examples
are at 13.43 and 19.82.
19.82 [a                plet akayblak]              [sa:r
      dem.dist.fem.sg plate impv+caus+overturn ﬂy
      r@-k@-k-la]
      sit-irr-irr+3fem.sgsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Turn that plate upside down, or else a ﬂy would sit (on it)’
   A juxtaposed irrealis clause can be negated with the dependent negator -ma:r-, as shown
in 19.83 (the meaning is that of possible negative consequence). This is unlike irrealis in main
clauses which is negated with the particle ak@s (see §14.3.1); also see 13.35. This suggests that
juxtaposed irrealis clauses could well be treated as a subtype of dependent clauses.
19.83 [k@-di       plet ajan]           [a                  kamna:gw
      dem.prox-pl plate impv+wash dem.dist+fem.sg food
      k@-mar-k-na-ñ@n]
      eat-neg.sub-irr-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Wash these plates, (or else) you will not eat the food’
III. If one of the clauses is negated, the relationship between juxtaposed clauses is that of
contrast, as in 14.41, 14.135, and 14.156. Juxtaposition of a positive and a negative clause can
be used as a means of clausal disjunction, as in 7.23.
IV. The subsequent clause marks consequence or reason if it contains an imperative or a
desiderative, as in 13.12, 13.20, 13.23–4, 13.58, 14.31, 14.90, 14.108, and 19.48. Both clauses
can contain either an imperative or a desiderative, as in 19.84.
19.84 [væk akrawul]               [s@kul@k yi-k@r]
      pot impv+bring+inside cooking do-des
      ‘Bring the pot inside (the house), (because) I want to cook’
V. A clause juxtaposed to another clause has a simultaneous temporal meaning if the verb
cross-references time in the second position. This is the case in 19.81 (second clause: ‘(time
when) the war came’) and 9.33. This illustrates the anaphoric or cataphoric function of cross-
referencing time in the second position on the verb, which acts as an additional clause-linking
device.
VI. Juxtaposition of clauses may also reﬂect a sequence of actions, as in T1.27. Juxtaposition
of two clauses with positional verbs has a similar eﬀect, e.g. 19.85:
19.85 [wun-a-d@    warag     nagw@m         war-@n      kwa:d]
      I-lk-masc.sg ancestor sago+lk+loc go.up-seq stay+3masc.sgbas.p
      [ra:d]
      sit+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘My ancestor kept going up the sago (ﬁelds) (and) settled down (lit. sat) (there)’
                                                        19.8 Complementation strategies         497We will see in §20.1.4 that there are no pivot restrictions on coreferential deletion of arguments
in clause juxtaposition, with just one exception: if juxtaposition of clauses reﬂects a sequence
of actions the subjects are always shared.
                         19.8 c o m p l e m e n tat i o n s t rat e g i e sManambu has no complement clauses as a separate clause type. Existing clause types are
used in lieu of complement clauses depending on verb type, the semantics of complement
clause (whether fact or activity, or potential), and the relative tense of the complement clause
(see Dixon 2006, for the basic principles for a typological approach to complementation). A
clausal complement can be in S or O function (but never in A function). These correlations are
summarized in Table 19.4.
   We discuss the existing complementation strategies one by one.
I. Completive medial clauses (discussed at §18.3) are used as clausal complements exclusively
in O function, with the verbs of perception such as ‘see/look’ and ‘hear/listen/obey’ (and
compounds and directional forms involving these: see Chapters 15 and 16). They indicate that
the action of the clausal complement precedes that of the main clause. The semantics of clausal
complement is activity or fact. If the subject of the main clause and of the clausal complement
are diﬀerent, diﬀerent subject forms are employed. Examples are at 19.86–7; also see T2.4,
T3.20, and T3.48.
19.86 [amæy wa-l@-k]                 [awuk]
      mother see-3fem.sg-compl.ds impv+hear/listen/obey
      ‘Listen to/obey what mother said’ (lit. mother having said, listen/obey)

      t@-ku]
      stand-compl.ss
      ‘After he’d seen that she’d done this because of the eel (her husband killed this eel)’
II. Juxtaposition of main clauses (also see §19.7) is used for a clausal complement in O func-
tion with the same verbs of perception. Juxtaposition is used if the action of the complement
is either simultaneous or subsequent to the main clause—in contrast to the completive medial
clauses in I above. Examples of simultaneous action are at 19.48, 19.88–9, 19.93a–b, 19.94, and
also T1.11 and T3.16.

      say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt impv+hear/listen/obey
      ‘Listen to/obey what I am saying’ (lit. having said, listen/obey)
19.89 [a       takwa-ñan       k@tu     v@-l@-l]                         [du

      ‘That young woman looked up and saw: the up-there-man was sitting there’
  If the action of the clausal complement is subsequent to that of the main clause, it can be
cast in future tense, as in 19.90. Such constructions are polysemous, in that they can denote

this is morphological—we can recall, from §13.3, that future morphology is homophonous
with irrealis.19.90 [kamapu-k-na]                                 [v@-k@-tua]
      appear-fut/irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt see-fut/irr-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      (a) ‘I will see her appear’ (lit, she will appear I will see)
      (b) ‘I will see if she appears’   The sentence in 19.90 could also be understood as consisting of a juxtaposed dependent
clause and a main clause (see §19.1), if it had a characteristic intonation contour with sharp
rise on the last word of the juxtaposed clause. Then the reading would have been ‘If she had
appeared I would have seen her/it’. This highlights the importance of intonation.
   A juxtaposed main clause can be used in lieu of a clausal complement of verbs ma: wa-
(no say) ‘refuse’ and ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree’, when they refer to a fact or activity and
involve diﬀerent subjects. We will see, at IV below, that if their subjects are the same, the
same-subject purposive or dative-aversive-marked nominalization will be preferred. Poten-
tial meaning entails the use of either diﬀerent-subject purposive or a dative-aversive-marked
nominalization. In 19.91, a fact complement expressed with a juxtaposed clause (clause 1) is
contrasted to a potential complement expressed with a dative-aversive-marked nominalization.19.91 [yi-tua]                        [ma: wa-na-di]            [k@-di       t@p-a

      ‘They objected to the fact that I went (hunting), these village men refused me (the
      permission) to cut sago in the sago ﬁeld’   Juxtaposition is also used if the clausal complement is in S function of the verb kus@- ‘ﬁnish’.
The clause which corresponds to the complement often cross-references time or manner in
second position. The main clause takes feminine singular cross-referencing as a default option
(see §5.2.3).19.92 [warya-n         t@-ya-da-l]                           [aka

      ‘Their ﬁghting was already over’ (lit. they kept ﬁghting (it) was already over)  Juxtaposition of a main clause can also be used in lieu of a clausal argument in the O slot of
mental processes: knowing, as in 19.93a–b, and forgetting, as in 19.94. The juxtaposed clause
as a complementation strategy can be preposed or postposed to the clause containing the verb
of mental process:19.93a [bar@k         wa-m@n@-l]                            [wun ma: la:kw]

marking an activity in the S function in a verbless clause, as in 19.95.
19.95 [vyak@t-a]         [væra-m@na]
      good-3fem.sgnom come.toward-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘It is good you came/are coming’ (lit. it is good—you came/are coming)
In each case, the clause boundary is signalled by an intonation break (less than a second
duration).
III. A relative clause with or without an overtly stated head noun can be used to express
clausal complement referring to a fact, as in 19.96a–b. The way of saying ‘tell me why you
came’ is ‘tell me the reason for which you came’.
19.96a [ya-m@na                                  maw]
       come-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt reason/base
       [wa-m@na]                              [wuk@u]
       say-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt listen+1sgimpv
       ‘You tell why you came, so that I listen’
  Another way of saying essentially the same thing is 19.96b. The diﬀerence is that in 19.96a
the speaker is requesting the full story concerning the reason of the other person’s coming,
while 19.96b presupposes a simpler statement—a ‘thing’ fought about:
19.96b [warya-bra                             ja:p] [ma: la:kw]
       ﬁght+come-3dusubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p thing neg know:neg
       ‘I do not know why (lit. thing) they fought about’
  Headless relative clauses, like the one at 19.25 (and 19.23a), can also be interpreted as
complementation strategies. They can express fact or activity. The syntactic context in 19.25
makes it clear that we are dealing with a headless relative clause: the common argument has
been omitted, but the adjective referring to it remains in its position in the noun phrase.
However, we saw above that a headless relative clause can be almost indistinguishable from
a main clause (cf. 19.26). And clause juxtaposition as a complementation strategy may also
be homonymous with a headless relative clause. So, 19.97a is inherently ambiguous between
reading (a), with a juxtaposed clause as a complementation strategy, and reading (b) as a
headless relative clause.
19.97a [k@layir                        r@-na]
       dem.prox.fem.sg+dist+all sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       [v@-ñ@na]
       see-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       (a) ‘Do you see that she is sitting here further away?’
       (b) ‘Do you see the one (female) sitting here further away?’
                                                        19.8 Complementation strategies          501   The ambiguity disappears if the second clause is negated: a relative clause would take the
dependent clause negator -ma:r-, and the juxtaposed clause would be negated like any main
clause (§14.5). The negated relative clause is at 19.97b, and a juxtaposed main clause at 19.97c:
19.97b [k@layir                     r@-ma:r-na]
       dem.prox.fem.sg+dist+all sit-neg.sub-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       [v@-ñ@na]
       see-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       (a) ‘Do you see the one (female) not sitting here further away?’
19.97c [k@layir                       ma: r@]        [v@-ñ@na]
       dem.prox.fem.sg+dist+all neg neg:sit see-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       (a) ‘Do you see that (she) is not sitting here further away?’
A similar example, with a verb of knowledge and understanding, is at 19.98, an angry shout at
a naughty and disobedient child:
19.98 [laku-ñ@na]                                       [wa-tua]
      know/understand-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-1fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      (a) ‘Did you understand that I was telling you (what to do)?’
      (b) ‘Did you understand what I was telling you?’
IV. Same-subject purposive marks a purpose complement of any verb if semantically appro-
priate, as shown in 7.76 and 19.43 (see §19.4.1). Same-subject purposive can also be used as a
complementation strategy with the verb ‘say’ if the subject of the verb expressing purpose or
intention is coreferential with the subject of ‘say’—see 13.45, 19.57 (§19.5.4), and 19.99:
19.99 [kwasa        ñan t@-tu@-k]             [wun-a:k krak
      small+fem.sg child stay-1sg-compl.ds I-lk+dat take+purp.ss
      wa-m@n@-l]
      say-2masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘When I was a small girl you spoke of marrying me’
V. Different-subject purposive clauses can mark a purpose complement of any verb (see
§19.4.1 and §13.4.2, and 13.54–5). This is also used in indirect commands, as in 19.54 and
13.49. A purposive clause as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ is the only way of forming a
diﬀerent-subject complement clause for the concept of ‘wanting’: 19.100 is ambiguous between
‘we told them to go to the house’ and ‘we wanted them to go to the house’. This ambiguity can
only be resolved by context.
19.100 [wiya:r          yi-b@r-k@k@k]    [wa-bana-b@r]
       house+lk+all go-3du-purp.ds say-1plsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
       (a) ‘We told them two to go to the house’
       (b) ‘We wanted them two to go to the house’
  In 13.51, only the ‘wanting’ reading is appropriate, since there was no speech act involved.
  In diﬀerent subject ‘wanting’ constructions, the verb ‘say’ can be omitted, as in 19.101. Then,
there is no ambiguity between ‘telling someone to do something’ and ‘wanting someone to do
something’. Similar examples are at 13.55, and 14.70.
19.101 wun-aba:b k@-d@                      ñan k@ta-b@         t@-d@-k@k@k
       I-too          dem.prox-masc.sg child now-already stand/be-3masc.sg-purp.ds
       ‘I too want this child to be like this now’ (lit. I too so that this child be like this now)
       ∗
         I too tell this child to be like this’
502     19 Other Dependent Clauses  The subject of the matrix clause can also be omitted—and then a sentence k@-d@ ñan k@ta-
b@ t@-d@-k@k@k means ‘(speaker wants) this child to be like this now’. This use of the diﬀerent-
subject purposive may be interpreted as an instance of desubordination—whereby the erstwhile
dependent clause becomes a main clause. Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are also used as
complementation strategies with verbs of asking, as in 13.52. An alternative is a direct speech
report, or a reported question, in VI below.
VI. Desiderative clause can mark a purposive complement of any verb—see §19.4.2 and §13.5
and 19.47. Desideratives in dependent clauses in O function can be used as complementation
strategies with potential meaning involving verbs of negative desire, such as ‘be unwilling’ in
19.102:
19.102 [wun tapwuk ba:d k@-k@r] [kwas@k yi-na-d@wun-@k]
       I     chicken egg eat-des unwilling go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
       ‘I am unwilling to eat chicken egg’
   A desiderative clause in the direct speech report slot of the verb wa- is the only way of
reporting non-ﬁrst person’s desire—see 19.58 and 13.57. A desiderative clause can be in the
S slot of a verbless clause—see 13.65.
VII. Direct speech reports framed by the verb wa- ‘say’ can be used as complementation
strategies. We saw in §19.5 above that a direct speech report is a special grammatical relation.
The meanings of direct speech reports range from fact/activity to potential, and can involve
statements, questions, and commands.
VIII. Reported questions can be used as complementation strategies in the O slot of the verb
of knowledge/understanding:
19.103 [wun-aba:b ma: la:kw]        [agwa-mi d@-k@-di t@k@-mi-a-di]
       I-too         neg know:neg what-tree he-obl-pl seed-tree-lk-3plnom
       ‘I, too, do not know what tree they are seeds of’
19.104 [wun ma: la:kw]     [kas        du-ta:kw      t@-na-di]
       I      neg know:neg how.many man-woman be/have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘I do not know how many people they have (in Malu)’
In 19.104, the interrogative quantiﬁer kas is postposed to the noun ‘people’ which is its normal
position (see 10.109–10 in §10.4). Reported questions typically refer to fact or activity. They
are rather rare in discourse of any sort, and may have been calqued from Tok Pisin or even
English.
IX. Nominalizations are widely used as complementation strategies. We can recall, from
§9.1.1, that deverbal nominalizations with Ø-case marking in O function are employed as
complementation strategies, with the verb ‘know’, as in 9.2, and ‘ﬁnish’, as in 4.8. A deverbal
nominalization in S function can also serve as a complementation strategy, as in 9.3. A
nominalization can be a complement of a verb ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 4.7, 9.9, 19.43, and T3.20,
T3.33, and T3.35. An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in T3.34 (where
it is negated). These nominalizations always refer to activity or fact.
    Deverbal nominalizations marked with dative-aversive case -Vk are used in the O slot of
verbs to do with not wanting, refusing, forbidding, feeling shame, as in 9.5–6, 13.78, and 13.81,
waiting as in 9.4, forgetting as in 13.79, being afraid of doing something, as in 13.82, and in the
sense of ‘for fear of’, as in 9.7 and 13.83, or ordering not to do something, as in 15.111.
                                                     19.8 Complementation strategies        503   There are no restrictions on subject coreferentiality—in 19.105a the subjects of the matrix
clause and of the complementation strategy are the same, and in 19.105b they are diﬀerent:19.105a [bar@k         kwa-kwa-k] [ma: wa-na-wun]
        sick+lk+dat stay-red-dat neg say-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
        ‘I don’t want to become sick’ (lit. to becoming sick I say no)19.105b [ñ@n      bar@k         kwa-kwa-k] [ma: wa-na-wun]
        you.fem sick+lk+dat stay-red-dat neg say-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
        ‘I don’t want you to become sick’ (lit. to you becoming sick I say no)  In all these cases a dative-aversive nominalization used as a clausal complement has a
‘potential’ meaning, that of future projection, similarly to 9.8. This is in contrast to a zero-
marked nominalization—see 4.7 and 9.9. A dative-aversive nominalization can never occupy
the S slot of any verb, except for verbs of diﬃculty.
X. Sequencing medial clauses can mark clausal complements of a transitive verb (as in 18.12
and 19.106–7) or of a ditransitive verb (18.13), as complementation strategies. The meaning is
that of an accomplished fact rather than a prolonged activity. They have been attested with the
verb wa- ‘speak’ (18.12 and 19.106), ‘teaching’ as in 18.13, and perception, as in 19.107.19.106 [na:gw ka:n          rap@-n]       [wa-k@k@-tua]
       sago eat+seq grow.up-seq say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I will tell of (their) eating sago (and) growing up’19.107 [ [a-b@r       ñidi      waku-n]  v@-ku]        [ [ak@tawa r@-na-b@r]
       dem.dist-du child:du go.out-seq see-compl.ss like.this sit-act.foc-3dubas.vt
       wa-ku]          [vya-d@-b@r]
       say-compl.ss hit-3masc.sgsubj.p-3dubas.p
       ‘Having seen the fact that the two children went out, having said, “This is how they
       are”, he hit them two’They can also be used with a verb denoting ‘diﬃculty’, in the S function (see 20.65).
XI. Medial clauses marked with -k@b ‘as soon as’ can be occasionally used as clausal
complements in the O slot of verbs of perception, if the speaker wishes to emphasize the
temporal overlap between the perception and the activity (see §18.6).19.108 [atawa sa:d t@-d@-k@k@b]                  [ak@s
       thus way stand-3masc.sg-as.soon.as neg.hab
       v@-kwa-bana-d]
       see-hab-1plsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘We usually do not see it (the rainbow) standing like this’   The meaning of the clausal complement is always that of activity simultaneous with percep-
tion; however, such examples are rare.
Table 19.4 shows that, of all the complementation strategies, the juxtaposition strategy and
deverbal nominalization are the most versatile in terms of verb types they occur with. The
verbs of perception and knowledge allow the greatest number of options in terms of types of
complementation strategies they occur with.
504     19 Other Dependent Clauses                 19.9 de s u b o r d i nat i o n o f d e p e n d e n t c laus e sWhat is an essentially dependent clause can come to be used as a main clause through regular
ellipsis of the erstwhile main clause. This phenomenon known as ‘desubordination’ has been
described for numerous languages, including English (see Stirling 1998). Desubordination and
the change of status of clauses can result in the creation of new tense-aspect-mood paradigms
(as in Australian languages: Dixon 2002a: 148–9), or evidentiality (as in Estonian: Aikhenvald
2004a: 281–3).
   Just three of the medial dependent clause types in Manambu are used on their own (see
§18.2–4). In each case, this can be considered ellipsis; however, each use has its own semantic
overtones and can be analysed as a new clause type ‘in the making’.
   Sequencing medial clauses with the verb marked with -n (§18.2) appear as strong commands,
as shown in 16.96, and 19.109—an annoyed order to a naughty child to be seated:19.109 jupwi     taka-n
       backside put.down-seq
       ‘Put your backside down!’ (lit. putting your backside down!)  A medial completive same-subject form on its own can also be used as a command, an
even stronger one. The illocutionary force is comparable to German participle commands, e.g.
hingesessen! ‘sitting here!’ An example is at 19.110—the mother was even more annoyed than
when she shouted 19.109:19.110 t@k@r-@-m     da-ku
       chair-lk-loc sit-compl:ss
       ‘Sit down on the chair immediately!’ (lit. Having sat on the chair!)  These command strategies ﬁll what can be conceived of as a ‘gap’ in the system. We saw
in §14.4.1 that Manambu has three prohibitive forms: a general prohibitive and two strong
prohibitives. But there is only one positive imperative (§13.2). The diﬀerent degrees of strength
of command corresponding to the degree of strength of prohibition are expressed through
command strategies employing desubordinated clauses. Rough correspondences, with numbers
of example sentences, are in Table 19.5.
  A medial sequencing clause can be used as a complete sentence if it states the result of an
activity, as in 19.111. A pause of less than a second’s duration signals a sentence boundary.
There is no pause between the two sequential verb forms in the second sentence.","[515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531]"
"
      2.5.3 When two or three grammatical words form one phonological wordThis includes noun phrases and complex predicates which may form one phonological word
(I) and phonological words containing clitics (II).
(I) A modiﬁer-head noun phrase consists of two grammatical words, since other adjectives
can intervene between the two, and the adjective can take gender and number agreement,
e.g. kw asá ñán (small+fem.sg child) ‘small female child’, kwasa-d´@ ñán (small-masc.sg child)
‘small male child’. Yet, if such an NP consists of two or three syllables, it is pronounced as
one phonological word, with the stress on the last component, as in [kula ""ma:dZ] (new word)
‘new word’, [kw asa-""ñan] ‘small child’, [k@-""ñan] (this.fem.sg child) ‘this female child’. In slow
deliberate register these can be pronounced as two words, e.g. [kw a’sa ""ñan], [k""@ ""ñan]. If an
NP consists of more than three syllables, each component receives an independent stress and
forms a phonological word on its own. The stress falls on the same syllable as it would if
each word were pronounced in isolation, e.g. kulá kamná:gw (new food) ‘raw food’, ñáura kudí
‘Iatmul language’, kw asá g@rg´@r ñán (small+fem.sg tiny child) ‘a tiny little child’, adawúr dú
(dem.dist+masc.sg+up man) ‘man up there; God’. This agrees with the preferred length of a
phonological word in Manambu.
   A complex predicate consisting of a monosyllabic nominal and a support verb (see §17.2)
can be pronounced as one phonological word, or as two. The compound bas s@ ‘ask’ (lit. ﬁrst
plant/put) is a typical example. In slow deliberate speech it can be stressed on the second,
inﬂected, component, or on both, that is, bás s@tuá ‘I ask’ in slow speech register and bass@tuá
or bas@tuá in normal speech register (see A6 in §2.6 on the reduction of a sequence of identical
consonants). The two components are distinct grammatical words, since the connector ata
‘then’ can intervene between the two and the imperative preﬁx a- occurs on the second
component, as in bás ás! ‘ask!’
(II) Two or even three grammatical words form one phonological word if at least one of them is
cliticizable. All such clitics can be either added to a host, or occur as independent phonological
words in slow register. They vary in the choice of hosts, and whether they are procliticized
or encliticized to it. All enclitics may acquire a secondary stress (independently of the length
of the phonological word they are in) and potentially may be pronounced as independent
words in very slow register. They also undergo phonological processes discussed under B
in §2.6.
(a) Encliticizable pronominal subject markers occur with non-verbal words in the predicate slot
(see §§3.1–2; Table 3.4). Some are monosyllabic, and some disyllabic. In slow speech they may
be stressed and separated by a short pause; some speakers optionally insert the glottal fricative
h in front of these clitics. (These enclitics and the cliticizable morphemes ata and aka discussed
under (e) below are the only instances where this phonetic h occurs.) Very slow register is
illustrated in 2.1a.
54     2 Phonology2.1a á:s (h)adi
     dog 3plnom
     ‘They are dogs; dogs are’
   Normal register is shown in 2.1b: note the secondary stress on the enclitic. The pronunciation
in 2.1c reﬂects normal to rapid speech—note the absence of the secondary stress.
2.1b á:s=adì
     dog=3plnom
     ‘They are dogs; dogs are’
2.1c á:s=adi
     dog=3plnom
     ‘They are dogs; dogs are’
   In normal to rapid speech, a stressed vowel sequence @-a on a clitic boundary results in
vowel fusion: @ + a → a: (see B2 in §2.6). Pronunciation in slow register (without vowel fusion)
is shown in 2.2a; in 2.2b, the same example is pronounced with normal speed, and the vowel
fusion takes place:
2.2a ñ@n-a-k´@         s´@=al
     you.fem-lk-obl name=3fem.sgnom
     ‘It is your name’
2.2b ñ@n-a-k´@         sá:l
     you.fem-lk-obl name+3fem.sgnom
     ‘It is your name’
(b) A few particles consisting of CV where V is either a short vowel or a schwa tend to cliticize
to the preceding phonological word. The emphatic particle ya (see §4.5.3) has low selectivity
and can be encliticized to any constituent. It always has a secondary stress, e.g. yawí=yà
‘work really’, akúr=yà ‘do get!’ This particle is more frequent in the speech of those who
frequently code-switch into Tok Pisin, and could well be a loan from Tok Pisin ya ‘exclamatory
or emphatic particle’. The adverb b@ ‘already’ is either procliticized to the following verb, as
in b`@ =yanád ‘he has already left’, or encliticized to the preceding adverbial or demonstrative,
e.g. atá=b`@ ‘then-already’, or to a sequence of procliticized personal pronoun, an adverbial
or a demonstrative, e.g. lakáb`@ (l@=aka=b@ ‘she=fem.sg.dist.dem.reactivated.topic=already)
‘she the one here already’. This is an instance of one phonological word consisting of three
grammatical words. In each case, b@ takes a secondary stress. A non-clitic equivalent of b@ is
b@ta:y ‘already’.
(c) Pronouns l@ ‘she’ and d@ ‘he’ (see §10.1) are optionally procliticized to the following stressed
word in normal to rapid speech, e.g. l@-atá ‘she then’ becomes latá (see B2 in §2.6), l@-a (she-
dem.dist.fem) ‘she that one’ becomes la(:), and d@-ada (he-dem.dist.masc.react.topic) ‘he
new topic S/O’ becomes dadá. The few extant nouns of C@ structure procliticize to the verb
in complex verbs (see §4.2), e.g. s@=kwá- (sleep=lie) ‘sleep, be asleep’ is pronounced as one
phonological word. We saw, in §2.1.2, that @ is pronounced as u if preceded or followed by
a labial consonant within a phonological word. That s@=kwá- can be pronounced as su=kwá-
shows that this sequence is treated as one word in its stress placement and also in the allophonic
variation. If this same construction is discontinuous (for instance, to express an afterthought),
s@ acquires its own stress, as in b@ta:y kwa-na, s@ (already lie-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt, sleep)
‘she is already lying, asleep’ (see (I) in §7.2).
                                                               2.6 Phonological processes        55(d) A monosyllabic negative form of the verb (see §14.1) cliticizes to the negator ma: in normal
to rapid speech register if the negation and the verb are contiguous, e.g. má: r@ ‘not sit’, má:
t@ ‘not have/be/stand’. The construction má: kw@ ‘not stay’ can be alternatively pronounced
either as má: kw, or as má: ku. If the sequence is interrupted, the verb forms an independent
phonological word, as in ma: n@bay t@ (not yet have:neg) ‘I/you/he/she/etc. do not have (it) yet’.
(e) Two disyllabic words tend to procliticize to the following verb, or encliticize to
the preceding verb: (h)aká ‘here (feminine singular); reactivated topic’, (h)atá ‘then’.
When cliticized, they retain a secondary stress on their ﬁnal syllable, as in atà=wá:d
‘then he said’, kus@lál=akà ‘it (feminine) is ﬁnished here’. The sequence aká-n-akà
(dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘this topical; here it is, this is how it is’
can occur on its own; at the end of a story it cliticizes to the ﬁnal verb, e.g. kus´@-l=akànaka
(ﬁnish-3fem.sgbas.vt=dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘it is now ﬁnished’.
This is an instance of three grammatical words realized as one phonological word. The form
ata procliticizes to a second person imperative with a subsequent fusion of identical vowels
(see B3 in §2.6), as in ata ada (then sit.impv) ‘sit, stay, wait’ which is pronounced as [ata:""n dá]
or [ata""n da], ata-n aw (thus-pred impv+speak) ‘speak thus’ which is pronounced as [ata""naw].
(f) The demonstrative kl@m ‘here (feminine singular)’ can procliticize to ma:n ‘negation’,
forming one word kl@má:n ‘here not; it is not here’ (the consonant reduction of sequence of
identical consonants is addressed in B1 in §2.6 below).
(g) Monosyllabic adverbial modiﬁers encliticize to an adjective or a verb they modify, e.g.
vyákata=m@y (good=very) ‘very good’, máya=k@ p (go=just) ‘just go!’ Very occasionally, a
monosyllabic object gets procliticized to the verb, e.g. áy yi-kná-d (impv+‘do’ go/say-fut-
3masc.sgbas.vt) becomes [ayikn""an d] ‘he will say: “do!” (e.g. the cooking)’. In the two farewell
formulae, the manner adverb yara ‘well’ procliticizes to the imperative verb, as in yara=má:y
(well=go.impv) ‘goodbye’ (literally, go well: said by the person who is staying). In the response
by the person who is going, yara procliticizes to the imperative of the verb ‘stay’ and the two
identical vowels undergo vowel fusion (B3 under §2.6 below), as in yaradákw (from yara=adákw
well=stay.impv) ‘stay well’ (§21.5).
   Special phonological processes apply on the boundary of cliticizeable morphemes. If a clitic
forms a phonological word with a root, the main stress does not shift, and long vowels do
not undergo reduction: compare tá:kw=a ‘it is a woman’ and takwá:k ‘to a woman’. This
constitutes evidence in favour of special status of clitic-containing words in Manambu (see
Aikhenvald 2002c, for a cross-linguistic perspective).
                             2.6 ph o n o lo g i c a l p ro c e s s e sPhonological processes occur on (A) aﬃx boundaries within a phonological word and on (B)
clitic boundaries within a sequence of clitics, or between a cliticized morpheme and its host.
The epenthetic glide insertion (C1) occurs on any boundary, be it a suﬃx boundary or a clitic
boundary.","[80, 81, 82]"

        1        Introduction: The Language and its Speakers
Manambu belongs to the Ndu language family, and is spoken by about 2,500 people in
ﬁve villages: Avatip, Yawabak, Malu, Apa:n, and Yambon (Yuanab) in East Sepik Province,
Ambunti district. About 200–400 speakers live in the cities of Port Moresby, Wewak, Lae, and
Madang; a few people live in Kokopo and Mount Hagen.                                   1.1 l i n g u i s t i c ty p eManambu is synthetic, with elements of fusion, and predominantly suﬃxing. The imperative
marker a- is the only fully productive preﬁx (§13.2.1), while the causative-manipulative preﬁx
kay- occurs with a limited number of verbs (§16.2.1). The inﬁx -ka- marks intensive forms of
non-agreeing adjectives (§4.3).
   Manambu has twenty consonants and nine vowels. There is a series of simple voiced and
voiceless bilabial, apico-dental, and dorso-velar stops (just like in other Ndu languages). Voiced
and voiceless bilabial and dorso-velar stops also have a labialized counterpart. All the voiced
stops and the voiced fricative j are prenasalized in word-initial, intervocalic, and word-ﬁnal
positions. Vowel length is contrastive. Long vowels a: and æ: are a recent innovation: older
speakers still pronounce these as sequences of identical short vowels interrupted by a glottal
stop. Syllable structure is (C)(C)V(C). Stress is movable and contrastive. Long vowels tend to
be stressed (Chapter 2).
   Open classes are nouns and verbs. Nominal categories include case, three numbers, and two
genders in the singular. Grammatical relations are expressed with verbal cross-referencing and
with nominal case marking. Manambu has nine case forms, more than any other Ndu lan-
guage. The subject case is formally unmarked. The same form marks locative and a deﬁnite and
fully involved object. Another form expresses direction and instrument. The dative case marks
beneﬁciary and maleﬁciary, and also has an aversive meaning, ‘for fear of’. The terminative
case means ‘on the very edge of’, and ‘up until’. Two cases mark ‘means of transportation’.
The substitutive case means ‘instead of’. The comitative case meaning ‘together with’ is
a major device for coordinating noun phrases. Its additional meanings are locative ‘along
(e.g. a road)’ and temporal ‘while’. Case markers may attach to verbal roots: the objective-
locative case marks completive aspect, dative case marks purpose, instrumental case derives
deverbal adverbs, and substitutive case marks dependent clauses meaning ‘instead of doing
something’.
   Verbal categories include personal cross-referencing fused with tense, aspect, mood
(imperative-permissive, and irrealis), and modalities (optative, purposive, desiderative, and two
frustratives). The subject (A/S) is always cross-referenced on the verb. A second argument—
direct object, beneﬁciary, location, time, manner, or instrument—can be cross-referenced if
it is more topical than the subject. A copula complement, a speech report, and a comita-
tive constituent are never cross-referenced. Members of word classes other than verbs take
2     1 Introductioncross-referencing enclitics when they occupy the predicate slot (Chapters 3–4). This is unlike
most other Ndu languages which cross-reference only the subject.
   A small closed class of agreeing adjectives has three members, ‘big’, ‘small’, and ‘ﬁne’; these
agree in gender and number with the head noun. About sixteen non-agreeing adjectives—
which cover semantic types such as value, dimension, colour, and age—share a number of
properties with nouns. Adverbs and time words are semi-closed classes which share a few
properties with nouns. Word class-changing derivations are limited.
   A striking property of Manambu is its gender system. Two genders, masculine and feminine,
are assigned to nouns according to their referents’ sex and also shape and size. That is, a
large house is masculine, and a small house feminine. Genders are covert in the sense that,
rather than being marked on the noun itself, they appear on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and adverbial demonstratives, and in possessive constructions. The feminine gender is both
formally and functionally unmarked (Chapter 5).
   Three numbers—singular, dual, and plural—are marked on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and in possessive constructions. Plural and dual are marked on most kinship terms and on
a few nouns with a human referent. Associative non-singular (X and his/her associates) is
restricted to just personal names (Chapter 6). The choice between ﬁve types of possessive
construction depends on the type of possessive relationship, of possessee, and of possessor
(Chapter 8).
   The system of demonstratives is unusually intricate. Three demonstrative roots, k@-
‘proximate demonstrative: near speaker’, wa- ‘proximate demonstrative: near addressee’, and
a- ‘distal demonstrative’, are used in nominal demonstratives, in manner adverbial demonstra-
tives, and in reactivated topic demonstratives. Nominal demonstratives express either spatio-
temporal deixis or ‘current relevance’. The latter are derived from the former with the suﬃx
-na- ‘current relevance’, indicating that the object of pointing is being talked about, or is of
immediate or ongoing importance to the speakers. Spatio-temporal demonstratives distinguish
gender and number, and may also distinguish either three additional degrees of distance, or
ﬁve directions. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives distinguish ﬁve directions, and two addi-
tional degrees of distance, but no number or gender. Reactivated topic demonstratives refer
predominantly to an S/O constituent (Chapter 10).
   Negation is marked diﬀerently depending on aspect, tense, mood, and modality. Non-
habitual negative indicative clauses have no person marking. All dependent clauses are negated
diﬀerently from main clauses. Three prohibitives diﬀer in their illocutionary force.
   Manambu has a productive system of verbal compounds (they can be alternatively analysed
as one-word serial verbs: Chapter 15). They express manner, aspectual and sequential mean-
ings, and function as valency-changing devices. Many are lexicalized and have idiomatic
meanings.
   Verbs divide into several subclasses depending on whether they can occur with directional
markers, and which directional markers they occur with. Inherently directional verbs
include the six basic verbs war- ‘go upwards’, da- ‘go downwards’, væki- ‘go across (away from
the speaker)’, væra- ‘go across (towards speaker)’, wula- ‘enter, come in, come in a direction
from the Sepik River’, and waku- ‘go out (including motion in direction away from the Sepik
River)’. These do not take any further directional speciﬁcations. Their roots are the base
for directional markers on other verbs, and on demonstratives. Intrinsically directional
verbs include four roots which must take directional suﬃxes, each of which corresponds
to an inherently directional verb. The majority of verbs are optionally directional. They
combine with bound forms consisting of s@- followed by a directional marker. Copula verbs,
                                                                         1.1 Linguistic type      3the general motion verbs yi- ‘go’ and ya- ‘come’, and ingestive and stative verbs do not combine
with any directionals. Directionals also have a valency-increasing eﬀect. Directionals on verbs
and on demonstratives have similar origins, but display subtle diﬀerences in their semantics
(Chapter 16).
   Manambu has a semi-productive causative-manipulative preﬁx kay- which causativizes a
limited set of intransitive verbs. When applied to transitive verbs, it indicates a special physical
eﬀort and the intensity of action. There is no passive. Instead, Manambu employs transitivity-
neutralizing constructions which involve clause chaining, and are ambiguous as to their status
as biclausal or as monoclausal. A reciprocal marker awarwa has an associative meaning
‘together with’. Reﬂexive meanings are expressed with a variety of means none of which
involves a verbal derivation (§16.2).
   Ten polyfunctional verbs can each be used as an auxiliary or as a support verb, and also
as a copula verb (Table 4.1, and Chapter 17). Auxiliary verb constructions express aspectual,
positional, and modal meanings. There are also a variety of idiomatic complex predicates. Body
part constructions—expressing emotional, mental, and physical states—are a special subtype
thereof.
   Clause linking in Manambu is achieved through a variety of means. The major strategy is
clause chaining via medial dependent clauses. In most cases this involves switch-reference (that
is, marking of dependent clauses may be sensitive to whether their subject (A/S) is the same as
that of the following clause or not). The tense and extent of action expressed in a medial clause
is determined by its relationship to the action of a subsequent dependent clause or a main
clause. There are also causal clauses, and ‘unlikely condition’ clauses. Other clause-linking
devices include juxtaposition of a dependent clause and a main clause (this is a preferred
manner of indicating conditional meanings); clause linking via a case marker ‘instead’ and
a suﬃx ‘like’, and clause linking involving connectives.
   Relative clauses are similar to main clauses in most properties; they are negated like depen-
dent clauses. Speech reports—direct, indirect, and ‘semi-direct’—are highly frequent. They
express a wide variety of meanings, including desire, fear, and reason. Manambu has no
complement clauses as a special clause type; instead, medial and other dependent clauses are
co-opted as complementation strategies (Chapters 18 and 19).
   Constituent order in Manambu tends to be verb ﬁnal. It is often motivated by discourse
pragmatics. Word order within constituents depends on their type. For instance, quantiﬁers
can precede the noun head or follow it depending on the referent’s topicality. Chapter 20
oﬀers a comprehensive analysis of the principles of ordering words and constituents, and also
of the structure of constituents, and of clauses. An argument, or the predicate, can occur
in a highlighting focus construction. A focused constituent appears marked as a non-verbal
predicate head with the appropriate person markers, and the rest of the clause remains as it
was. Highlighting focus constructions may appear biclausal. A focused noun phrase has the
makings of a full verbless clause, since it contains the non-verbal cross-referencing markers.
However, it is not a full clause because it cannot be negated separately. Highlighting focus
constructions are an instance of grammar-in-the-making, similar to transitivity-neutralizing
constructions involving clause chaining (§19.9 and §20.3).
   Manambu has a highly elaborate verbal and nominal lexicon. Typologically unusual seman-
tic groups of verbs cover eating, drinking, and chewing, perception, and speech. Highly speciﬁc
terms coexist with highly generalized ones. A general noun ma:gw ‘whatever, whatchamacallit’
and a general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever’ are an option, if one cannot think of the right term, or
prefers to be non-speciﬁc. In the Manambu tradition, knowledge—tantamount to monetary
4      1 Introductionriches—is viewed in terms of lexicon, especially the totemic names (which are nouns). The
issue of name ownership acquires particular importance at name debates (saki). Multiple
‘names’—each belonging to a diﬀerent clan—result in multiple synonymy. The totemic names
are used as address terms, as an integral part of Manambu speech etiquette, where the tradi-
tional patterns coexist with newly acquired Western imports.
   In terms of the etymological make-up of its lexicon and grammar, Manambu is a central
member of the Ndu family. There are a number of loans from other languages of the area,
mostly Western Iatmul. Similarities between Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma are
contact induced. All the speakers of Manambu are proﬁcient in Tok Pisin and many also
in English, and code-switching is pervasive. Signs of incipient language obsolescence look
ominous—however, a strong opposition to language loss gives room to hope that the language
will live.
                     1.2 t he manambu: t h e p r e s e n t a n d t h e pa s tThe Manambu occupy ﬁve villages in the Ambunti District in the East Sepik Province
of Papua New Guinea (see Map). They live mostly on the Sepik River (Manambu ñab,
cf. Kwoma nabagey 1 ), and more precisely, on its section between the Hunstein Mountain range
and the Washkuk Hills. Avatip is the major village in terms of population, of physical size, of
ceremonial signiﬁcance, and of military exploits. We return to this in §1.2.2 and §1.4.
   The Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma have been fortunate, in terms of attracting
high-quality anthropological research. Useful and highly informative accounts of the Man-
ambu culture in Newton (1971), Bragge (1990), and especially Harrison (1983, 1985a–b, 1987,
1990a–b, 1993) contain anthropological analysis and innumerable insights into the cultural
and cognitive patterns of Manambu ritual and everyday life over the years. This is why this and
the following sections are limited to a very brief sketch of cultural background, with just the
information necessary for understanding the grammar which follows.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

                             13.2.1 Formal aspects of imperativeThe second person form of imperative is by far the most frequent in conversations. Second
person imperative is the only form marked with a productive preﬁx in Manambu (the other
preﬁx, kay- ‘transitivizer; manipulative’, is not productive). This is accompanied by the loss of
root-ﬁnal vowel in many disyllabic verbs (except for those ending in a vowel other than a or @)
and in all monosyllabic verbs, e.g. k@- ‘eat’, ka- ‘paddle’, imperative ak; taka- ‘put’, imperative
a-tak; wuk@- ‘hear, understand’, imperative a-wuk; but rali- ‘untie’, imperative a-rali; kusu-
‘put on’, imperative a-kusu; kisi-yi- (get-go) ‘keep getting’, a-kisi-yi! ‘keep getting’ (see §11.3.2).
The stress in the second person imperative falls on the root. There is a certain amount of
inter-speaker variation: innovative speakers occasionally omit the root-ﬁnal i in imperatives of
disyllabic verbs, while traditional speakers do not do this. For instance, an imperative of væki-
‘go across’ would be a-væk ‘go across!’ for an innovative speaker, and a-væki for a traditional
speaker.
   Verbs of the structure CCV undergo ﬁnal vowel deletion. A schwa is inserted between the
two consonants to avoid unauthorized clusters, as in gra- ‘cry’, a-g@r ‘cry!’, bla- ‘speak’, a-b@l
‘speak!’; kra- ‘get; marry’, a-k@r ‘marry!’ (as in 13.4).

                          3fem                  -kwa   The second person imperative of wa- ‘say’ is áu or áw—that is, after the ﬁnal vowel dele-
tion w can be vocalized as u. The imperative of kui- ‘give to third person’ is a-kwí, with
the stress on the second vowel, and the ﬁrst vowel becoming a glide. The imperative of
kwatiyá- ‘give to non-third person’ is a-kwatáy, with an irregular vowel change in the last
syllable.
   Suppletive second person imperative (mentioned in §11.3.2) is found with frequently used
verbs of stance and motion (some of which also occur as copulas in copula clauses). The second
person imperative of r@- ‘sit’ and of t@- ‘stand; have’ is ada. The second person of kwa- ‘stay’
is adakw. Other forms from the imperative paradigm of all these verbs are regular, e.g. rau ‘let
me sit, may I sit’, r @-kwa-d ‘let him sit’; tau ‘let me stand, let me have’, t@-kwa-d ‘let him stand,
let him have’. A list of these verbs is in Table 13.2.
   The two stance verbs also used as copulas, r @- and t@-, share one second person imperative
form, as shown in 13.1 and 13.2. The two are distinguished in all other forms.13.1 da:n        ada

278     13 Mood and ModalityThe verb yi- has a suppletive imperative ma:y in its meaning ‘go’. When the same form is used
as a copula and in the meaning ‘say’, the imperative is ay (see §4.2.2).
   Verbs with stative meanings, e.g. r@p- ‘be enough’, warsam(a)- ‘be angry’, cannot form a
second person imperative; neither can such copulas as na- ‘be (of abstract states)’, tay- ‘be (of
climate states)’, yasa/@- ‘be (of physical states)’, say- ‘be (of some states, e.g. shame, pins and
needles)’, and yæy- ‘be (of smells)’. Verb compounds with the second component ya- ‘come’ do
not form second person imperatives.
   Unlike the second person imperative, the corresponding ﬁrst and third person forms can be
formed on any verb, including statives.
   The formation of ﬁrst person imperatives is straightforward (see §11.3.2 under A, on the
vowel lengthening in monosyllabic roots): the markers listed in Table 13.1 attach to the stem.
These do not appear to be etymologically related to each other. Third person imperatives
contain the suﬃx -kwa accompanied by gender and number markers employed throughout the
language—the masculine singular -d, dual -b@r, and plural -di. Feminine singular form is ø. It
is realized as -l if followed by the optative suﬃx -@u (§13.2.3). This distribution of the feminine
singular allomorphs—whereby ø occurs at the end of a word, and -l occurs if followed by a
vowel—is consistent with §5.1.2 and Table 5.2.
   The distinction between three subsets of imperatives—ﬁrst, second, and third person—is
neutralized under negation. We discuss the prohibitives (or negative imperatives), and their
correlations with person, in §14.4.
   The second person imperative preﬁx a- has cognates in Iatmul and in Boiken (Freudenburg
1970: 79). The origin of ﬁrst person imperative markers is obscure. The marker of ﬁrst person
dual, -t@k, may be etymologically related to the ﬁrst person dual subject marker of the subject
series, -ta or -t@. The ﬁrst person plural suﬃx -nak does not seem to have any correlates
elsewhere in the language (n could be cognate to -n in ﬁrst person plural pronoun ña-n).
The etymology of the third person imperative marker -kwa may be related to the jussive
-ku in Ambulas and/or to the formative -kwa- in yékwak, an additional marker of third person
imperative in Ambulas (Wilson 1980: 168–9). Another potential cognate is -kwa in just one
second person imperative form in Iatmul: ya-kwa (come-impv) ‘come!’                              13.2.2 Semantics of imperativeIn addition to formal diﬀerences, the three person forms of imperative diﬀer in their semantics.
Second person imperatives are typically used for orders (A); ﬁrst person imperatives often have
permissive overtones (B); and third person imperatives tend to combine these two meanings
(C). These diﬀerences are likely to be due to universal correlations between person value
and the meaning of a command with it. The three persons share just one non-command
function (D).
A. Second person imperatives are typically used for commands and orders. They are extremely
frequent in Manambu discourse. Commands are addressed to people of any age, and especially
to children. Such was the frequency with which the baby Jemima (15 months) kept hearing 13.1
that she started using this construction as a name for chair and bench, in a slightly reduced
form dandá.
   If the speaker deems it necessary, the gender and the number for the addressee of second
person imperative can be supplied by a personal pronoun, as in 13.3–4. In 13.3 the imperative
is formed on a complex predicate (in square brackets) consisting of the main verb marked with
the manner suﬃx -n and the auxiliary kwa- ‘stay’ (which has a suppletive imperative adakw).
                                                                       13.2 Imperative     27913.3 ñ@n      [kur@-n        adakw]
     you.fem take.care-seq stay.impv
     ‘You (feminine) stay looking after (the baby)’
   Constituent order in imperative clauses is similar to that in declarative clauses. The O can
follow the verb if it is an established topic, as in 13.4:
13.4 m@n      ak@r         k@            ta:kw Kamkudi
     you.masc impv+marry dem.prox.fem.sg woman Kamkudi
     ‘You marry this woman, Kamkudi!
  A topically established subject can occasionally follow the verb, as in 13.5:
13.5 adakw     b@r
     stay.impv you.du
     ‘You two stay!’
Two second person imperatives can follow each other in one sentence, expressing two concomi-
tant actions, as in 13.6:
13.6 ma:y    gur      awakw
     go.impv you.pl impv+go.out
     ‘Go, you (plural) go out’
   Any imperative form can be accompanied by the hortative jau ‘don’t worry; you may do it’
(see §4.5), as in 4.78 and 13.7, with the meaning of letting something happen:
13.7 jau          a-war
     don’t.worry impv-go.up
     ‘Go up (into the house) without any restraint’
  Similar examples, with other persons, are at 13.17 and 13.23. Just like any other command,
second person imperative often occurs followed by the emphatic particle ya, to make a com-
mand sound more urgent (see §4.5, and also 13.14).
B. First person imperatives have slightly diﬀerent meaning overtones depending on the
number value. First person singular imperative has permissive meaning, and is often used for
mild requests.
13.8 kwasa          wiya:r            yau
     small+fem.sg house+lk+all go+1sgimpv
     ‘May I go to the toilet; let me go to the toilet’
13.9 bas sau
     ﬁrst plant+1sgimpv
     ‘May I ask’ (lit. ‘ﬁrst plant’)
The ﬁrst person imperative has a permissive meaning when used in content questions implying
ﬁrst person’s intention, as in 13.10.
13.10 t@p-a      kudir          ‘marasin’ at@ta wau
      village-lk language+all ‘medicine’ how say+1sgimpv
      ‘How shall I say “medicine” in Manambu (lit. the village language)?’
  In yes-no questions, the implication is that of the speaker’s intention to be conﬁrmed by the
addressee. After we came back from a tiring trip to Yawabak, Dora took a limbum leaf and
asked me:
280     13 Mood and Modality13.11 yabru
      fan+1sgimpv
      ‘Shall I fan (you) (to cool you oﬀ)?’
  This same form occurs in general statements of intention without any implication of per-
mission, as in 13.12. Note the person marker -m@n rather than the expected -d@m@n: this may
indicate an emergent new non-declarative form.
13.12 mæy-a           ata wun-a:m kayk@t@-m@n                    krayu
      come.impv-voc then I-lk+loc hold.onto-2masc.sgbas.vt take+1sgimpv
      ‘You come (said the hawk to the man), you hold on to me, and I shall take you (there)’
  A command to a second person can be echoed by a command to a ﬁrst person, as in 13.13.
Here, the tree kangaroo is telling his mate and himself who is going to occupy what seat on a
canoe. The tree kangaroo is not asking for permission—he is stating what he is going to do.
13.13 [m@n     ya:n         mal@m                ada]            [wun ya:n
      you.masc come+seq side/stern+lk+loc sit/stand.impv I              come+seq
      tama:b         ta:u]
      nose+lk+term stand+1sgimpv
      ‘You come and sit/stand at the stern; let me stand at the nose (of a canoe)’
  The two positional verbs used here (‘sit’ and ‘stand’) share one second person imperative;
but have diﬀerent forms in other persons.
  First person non-singular (dual and plural) forms of imperative are usually employed as
hortatives (‘let’s do something’) as in 13.14. The emphatic particle ya makes the command
sound truly urgent.
13.14 [ [am@y taka-n] wapa-ñ@n]              [yi-t@k       ya]
      basket put-seq leave-2fem.sgbas.vt go-1duimpv emph
      ‘You put the basket (to collect shrimp) and leave it, and (then) let’s two of us go’
  As illustrated in 13.13, ﬁrst person singular imperative can occur with ﬁrst person singular
pronoun if it is contrastive: the tree kangaroo contrasts himself to his companion on the canoe.
Non-singular ﬁrst person pronouns can be used in a similar way. We can recall that with
second person imperatives, second person pronouns have a somewhat diﬀerent function of
disambiguating number and gender of the addressee.
C. Third person imperative is used for commands and instructions with reference to a third
person, as shown in 13.15. There are no semantic diﬀerences between singular and non-singular
numbers; and an overt subject NP can be supplied, if necessary.
13.15 adaku                          t@pwi:m       t@-na-d-@

      ‘Tomorrow may the elder sister climb up the betelnut tree standing there in the outward
      direction in the opening, having picked (the nuts), may she go down, then may the
      younger sister climb up’
  Third person imperative can have permissive overtones, of letting something happen by itself,
as in 13.16—an instruction on how to take sore throat lozenges.
                                                                          13.2 Imperative       28113.16 k@marki-tukwa       dayim         kur@-n kwa:n

      go-around?-around?-impv.3p+fem.sg
      ‘Do not swallow (it), having got (it in your mouth) with it staying (there) let it dissolve’
  In 13.17, the elder sister was urged not to bother the baby while the baby was eating: the
overtone of ‘letting her be’ is emphasized by the use of jau ‘don’t worry; let it be’:
13.17 kamna:gw jau             k@-kwa
      food         don’t.worry eat-impv.3p+fem.sg
      ‘Let her eat food!’
  Or a third person imperative can express permission, as in 13.18:
13.18 k@-d@               nabi-d@ka ñan-a-wa da-n              yawi kur-kwa
      dem.prox-masc.sg year-only we-lk-com go.down-seq work do/get-impv.3p+fem.sg
      ‘Let her be allowed to work with us down there for only this year!’
  Descriptions of what was traditionally allowed are also cast in third person imperative. In
13.19, Saosepali tells her audience that, traditionally, only initiated men were allowed to sit on a
bench. This is cast in third person imperative. In the last line, a negative obligation is expressed
using a nominalization—see §9.1.1 and §14.3.3.

      ‘Only he (the initiated man) could sit on the bench, he used to sit on the bench, as for
      woman, she was not to sit on the bench, or else her blood would clot like a haemorrhoid’
   A traditional blessing (performed by blowing lightly on the person, the process called
wur@basaw@l-) is accompanied by asking the blesser’s spirit to ensure the addressee is cured
if they are sick. This also involves a third person imperative (also see Harrison 1993: 108):
13.20 wun-a-d@      kayik          ba:r kus@-kwa                yara kwa-kwa-d
      I-lk-masc.sg spirit/image illness end-impv.3p+fem.sg well stay-impv.3p-masc.sg
      ‘My spirit, may the illness end, may he (the patient) be well’
  Third person imperative occurs with modal words discussed at §4.5.1 with an overtone of
‘ought to’, or ‘must’, as in 13.21:
13.21 a     n@b@ asa:y-a:b wuk@-kwa-d
      then able father-too understand/know-impv.3p-masc.sg
      ‘(I will tell the father that a man wanted to marry you two), then the father too must
      know’
   The Tok Pisin borrowing mas ‘must’ can occur with third person imperative in the meaning
of strong obligation. Paul Kat said 13.22 to Sepaywus, explaining why he had to tell me the
story of the Gala wars:
282     13 Mood and Modality13.22 l@ mas laku-kwa
      she must know-impv.3p+fem.sg
      ‘She must know’
  Third person imperatives diﬀer from ﬁrst and second person imperatives in some of their
non-command meanings—we discuss these in the next subsection.
D. The non-command meaning of imperatives—shared by forms of all persons—is that
of consequence and indirect causation. The ﬁrst clause expresses the cause, and the second
clause—cast in imperative—expresses the result. The ﬁrst clause can also contain an
imperative, as in 13.23. Such a combination of two clauses is the only natural way of expressing
the notion of ‘feeding someone’:
13.23 jau,         k@-di        r@k-a-kija:p-@-r@b              kwatiyau
      don’t.worry dem.prox-pl dry-lk-protein.food-lk-fully give.to.nonthird+1sgimpv
      ak
      impv+eat
      ‘Don’t worry, let me give you these real pieces of dry meat/ﬁsh, (so that) you eat’
      (meaning ‘let me feed you with these pieces of dry meat/ﬁsh’)
  A sentence consisting of several clauses the last of which contains an imperative—as in
13.24—is the most natural way of saying ‘get her to come’:
13.24 [wun-a ta:kw al@m                      kwa-l@-k]
      I-lk    wife dem.dist+fem.sg+loc stay-3fem.sg-compl.ds
      [wa-yak@-gur-@k]        ya-kwa
      say-throw-2pl-compl.ds come-impv.3p+fem.sg
      ‘Get my wife to come from there’ (lit. My wife having stayed there, you order (lit. say-
      throw) her: may she come)
  Third and second person imperative in direct speech reports is a widespread means of
expressing causation. ‘ “May his throat be wet”, he said (and) gave him water’ in T2.34 is a
functional equivalent of ‘he made (or let) him drink water’. Along similar lines, 13.25 is the
most natural way of rendering the meaning of ‘tell your wife to bring sago’:
13.25 m@n-a                  takwa:k        wa-m@n-@k                na:gw

      kapra-kwa

      ‘Tell your wife to bring sago across to me’ (lit. After you have told your wife, may she
      bring sago across to speaker)
Manambu has a morphological causative with limited productivity, and a syntactic causative
which is infrequent and has strong implications of forceful causation—see §16.2.2. Marking
causation with the help of imperative, as illustrated in 13.25, helps ﬁll an existing gap.
   A sequence of a non-imperative and an imperative form is a way of expressing one action
following another as its consequence, without any forceful causation, as in 13.26.

13.27: the girl who has been abducted against her will leaves kitchen ashes behind on the path
so that her brothers could come to her rescue by following the ashes (see §19.5).13.27 waku-l@-l,                          ya:b bau yak@-n        mæn væs@-n,

      I-lk+fem.sg footprint+lk+loc come-impv.3p-du see+seq see+seq say-compl.ss
      ‘She went (out of the house), throwing ashes on the road, (every time) she made a step,
      so that her two brothers could come following her footprints (lit. having said, may they
      two come (following) my footprints)’  Unlike any other imperative form, third person imperative can be used in maledictions: the
exasperated mother who said 13.28 did not wish her daughter dead. A third person imperative
here expresses her anger at the recalcitrant child:13.28 kiya-kwa             kwasa-kwasa wula-ma:r-@n
      die-impv.3p+fem.sg little-little   enter-neg.sub-seq
      ‘May she die, having nearly missed (being hit by a lid)’This usage is similar to that of third person imperative forms in optatives discussed in §13.2.3.
  As is the case in many languages, second person imperative forms occur in leave-taking
formulae (see §21.5.2). The second person general prohibitive of wa- ‘say’, wa-tukwa, has an
additional meaning of ‘say it again, I couldn’t agree more’ (§21.1.3). Note that the strong
prohibitives, -way and -wayik, with this same verb do not have such overtones—see §14.4.
  First person singular imperative of the verb wa- ‘say, speak’ (wa:u ‘may I say; let me say’)
and also of bla- ‘talk’ mark turn-taking in public speaking, and in story telling. The second
person imperative of the verb wuk@- ‘hear, listen’ (awuk ‘hear, listen!’) is used as an attention-
getting device in public speaking, including the name-debating ceremonies, and oratories
during funerary ceremonies.
  A number of devices can be used instead of commands, with weaker or stronger illocutionary
force. These command strategies are discussed in §19.9.","[303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310]"
"                     11.3.2 Other root-speciﬁc alternations in verbsNon-automatic root alternations occur in verbs of a variety of types listed below.
A. Monosyllabic verbs consist of CV, with the root vowel either @ or a. (The few verbs with a
root vowel u do not occur without directionals, e.g. ku- as in ku-su- ‘put on; dress’; ku-sada ‘put
downwards’.) Examples are ka- ‘paddle’, ra- ‘cut’, wa- ‘speak, say’, k@- ‘eat, drink’, j @- ‘chew’,
r@- ‘sit; copula’. When these verbs take a suﬃx and the resulting form is monosyllabic, the root
vowel is lengthened, as in wa:d (say+3masc.sgbas.p) ‘he said’; ja:l (chew+3fem.sgbas.p) ‘she
chewed’. Note that the verbs with vowel a and with @ are then regularly homophonous: ra:l
(sit/cut+3fem.sg.bas.p) means ‘she sat’ and ‘she cut’.
   The verbs yi- ‘go’ and ya- ‘come’ also become homonymous when the resulting form is
monosyllabic, as in ya:l (go/come+3fem.sg.bas.p) ‘she went’; ‘she came’. These are not ambigu-
ous if the form is not monosyllabic, e.g. r@-na (sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.np) ‘she is sitting’
and ra-na (cut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.np) ‘she is cutting’, yi-na (typically pronounced as y@-na)
(go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.np) ‘she is going’ and ya-na (come-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.np) ‘she is
coming’.
   When such verbs take the second person imperative preﬁx a-, the root vowel is deleted, as in
aw ‘speak, say!’, aj ‘chew!’ This often creates homonymy between verbs with vowel a and @, so
ak means ‘paddle!’ and ‘eat!’ But in fact such homonymy is not all that pervasive, since many
monosyllabic verbs of posture and motion have suppletive imperatives. For example, ar can
only mean ‘cut!’, because the positional verb r @- ‘sit’ (also used as a copula: see Chapter 17)
has a suppletive second person imperative ada which it shares with another monosyllabic verb,
t@- ‘be, have, stand’. Examples of monosyllabic verbs with suppletive second person imperatives
(see §13.2) are kwa- ‘stay/lie’, imperative adakw; yi- ‘go’, imperative ma:y; ya- ‘come’, imperative
mæy; da- ‘go down’, imperative adi:d. The verb yi- is used as a copula and in the meaning ‘say’
forms a regular imperative ay ‘say!’
   When the permissive (ﬁrst person imperative) suﬃx -u (see §13.2) is added to a monosyllabic
verb with a root vowel @, this vowel becomes a,as in k@- ‘eat, drink’, kau ‘may I eat, drink’.
Permissive forms of monosyllabic verbs with root vowels @ and a are consistently homopho-
nous, and have to be distinguished by the context, e.g. kau ‘may I paddle/drink’; similarly, yau
(go/come+1sgimpv) ‘may I come/go’.
   Negative declarative non-future forms of these verbs involve reduction of the root vowel,
that is, a to @, e.g. da- ‘go down’, ma: d@ ‘did not/do not go down’. Such forms of verbs of CV
252      11 Predicate Structure and Verb Root Typesstructure distinguishable only by their vowel become homophonous: ma: k@ means both ‘did
not/do not paddle’ and ‘did not/do not eat’.
   The verbs ‘go’ and ‘come’ have the same negative form in the Malu variety (ma: y@ ‘did
not/do not go/come’), but are distinguished in the Avatip variety: ma: y@ ‘did not/do not go’
and ma: yæy ‘did not/do not come’.
   The monosyllabic verb kwa- ‘stay, lie’ has a somewhat irregular negative form: ma: ku or
ma: kw(@), depending on the speaker (meaning ‘did not/do not stay/lie’). Declarative non-
future negative constructions do not form one phonological or grammatical word: they can be
discontinuous, e.g. ma: n@bay k@ (neg yet eat:neg) ‘has/have not eaten yet’ (see §14.1.1).
   When a monosyllabic verb with a vowel a undergoes reduplication, the second reduplicand
contains @, as in wa- ‘say’, wa-w@ ‘saying’, ya- ‘come’, ya-y@ ‘coming’.
   Monosyllabic verbs require a formative -k- in the strong prohibitive (§14.4.1 and D below),
e.g. wa-k-wayik ‘do not ever say’, k@-k-wayik ‘do not ever eat’.
   We saw, in §2.2.3, that monosyllabic roots of CV structure are ‘light’ in terms of their syllable
weight; consequently, they require an additional syllable when combined with the syllable-
weight-sensitive suﬃxes -taka ‘immediate sequencing’ and -yak@p ‘frustrative’ (also see §15.2.5
for similar phenomena in the choice of the allomorphs for the incompletive -p@sa).
B. Numerous disyllabic verbs of CVCV structure and verbs of CVC structure have
vowel alternations in the negative non-future form. Their negative non-future form also
involves dropping the verb-ﬁnal vowel, e.g. waku- ‘go out’, ma: wa:kw ‘did not/do not go out’.
The ﬁrst syllable vowel a undergoes compensatory lengthening, as in waj@- ‘laugh’, ma: wa:j
‘did not/do not laugh’, gaji- ‘rub’, ma: ga:j ‘did not/do not rub’.
   A syllabic vowel @ or i becomes a:, for example g@r - ‘scratch’, ma: ga:r ‘did not/do not
scratch’; kwatiy- ‘give to non-third person’, ma: kwata:y ‘did not/do not give to non-third
person’. The ﬁrst syllable vowel u becomes a:, as in suku- ‘write, carve’, ma: sa:kw ‘did not/do
not write/carve’, wuk@- ‘hear, understand’, ma: wa:k ‘did not/do not hear/understand’; or wa:,
as in kus@- ‘ﬁnish’, ma: kwa:s ‘did not/do not ﬁnish’, kur- ‘get, do’, ma: kwa:r ‘did not/do not
get/do’. A sequence ui becomes wa:, as in kui- ‘give to third person’, ma: kwa:y ‘did not/do not
give to third person’.
   All these verbs also drop their ﬁnal root vowel in forming second person imperative, e.g.
a-wakw ‘go out!’, unless they contain the vowel -i or -u in their second syllable, e.g. wali- ‘go
round’, a-wali ‘go round!’, ma: wali ‘did not/do not go round’, ku-su- (put-up) ‘put on; dress’,
a-ku-su ‘put (clothing) on’, ma: ku-su ‘did not/do(es) not put on’.
   Negative declarative non-future forms may appear in negated subordinate clauses, e.g. kui-
‘give to third person’, kwa:y-mar-@n (give.to.third.p.neg-neg.sub-seq) ‘by not giving to third
person’ (see §14.1). This shows that the vocalic alternations in negative non-future forms cannot
be accounted for by the fact that the resulting form is monosyllabic.
   Verbs of the structure CVC and CCV form second person imperatives of the form
a-C@C, and if their consonants are the same, the imperatives are homophonous, e.g. gra- ‘cry’,
imperative ag@r ‘cry!’; g@r ‘scratch’, imperative ag@r ‘scratch!’ Note that their negative forms
are diﬀerent: ma: g@r ‘did not/do not cry’ versus ma: ga:r ‘did not/do not scratch’.
C. Verbs which contain a final syllable -ya drop it in second person imperative and in
negative declarative non-future. The vowel i is lengthened in the negative form, e.g. kiya-
‘die’, aki ‘die!’, ma: ki: ‘did not/do not die’, vya- ‘hit, kill’, avi ‘hit/kill!’, ma: vi: ‘did not/do
not hit/kill’. The vowel u is realized as wi in the imperative and in the negative form, e.g.
guya- ‘vomit’, agwi ‘vomit!’, ma: gwi: ‘did not/do not vomit’. When reduplicated, the second
                                                         11.3 Root alternations in verbs       253reduplicand has the shape Ci or Cwi, as in vya-vi (hit/kill-red) ‘hitting, killing’ and guya-gwi
‘vomiting’.
D. A number of verbs take the formative -k- in combination with the marker of the
strong prohibitive -way and wayik (§14.5). These include monosyllabic verbs (A above) and
a few verbs of CVC structure, e.g. gaj-@-k-wayik ‘do not ever rub’, but@-k-wayik ‘do not ever
fold’. The origin of this formative requires further etymological analysis.
In addition, a number of disyllabic roots may undergo optional reduction of their second
syllable, e.g. yasa- and yas@- ‘be: of feelings’, and -t@ka and -t@k@- ‘do incompletely’ (see 15.38
and discussion there).
In summary: monosyllabic (CV) verbs form one consistent class in terms of root alternations.
The information on whether any of the other verbs belongs to an alternating class or not needs
to be given in a dictionary.
        12        Verbal Categories in Positive Declarative
        and Interrogative ClausesIn this chapter we discuss verbal categories of positive declarative and interrogative clauses
shared with relative and juxtaposed sequencing clauses (see §§19.1–2). None of these categories,
except root reduplication (§12.8) and the customary aspect (§12.7), can be expressed in most
medial clauses (Chapter 18). Forms discussed in §§12.6–7 and §12.8.1 are uninﬂected (unlike
the rest of the forms discussed here). Further aspectual meanings are expressed with verb
compounding (§15.3) and complex predicates (§17.1.1).
                  12.1 no n- f ut u r e t e n s e s a n d ac t i o n f o c u s                                 12.1.1 Non-future tensesFully inﬂected verbs can occur with cross-referencing suﬃxes which also mark either past or
the ‘versatile’ tense. The latter has a wide range of meanings covering recent past (yesterday or
a couple of days ago), near future, and present. The past refers to what happened a few days
ago or earlier than that. These suﬃxes are listed in Tables 3.1–2 (see also Table 11.2).
   Past tense is typically used in stories and accounts of the past. An example is under 12.1. The
verb in the ﬁrst main clause cross-references two arguments (the second argument is O which
is highly animate and topical). The verb in the second clause cross-references one argument:
there is no argument more topical than the A/S.
12.1 [wa-ku],       [Kuimagan Lai ata yata-d@-d]                                [yata-n
     say-compl.ss Kuimagan Lai then carry-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p carry-seq
     t@-d@-k],                 [Sirunki aka                          wula-l]
     have-3masc.sg-compl.ds Sirunki dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg go.inland-3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘Having said (this), Kuimagan then carried Lai, as he was carrying him, Sirunki went into
     the bush away from the river’
  A reactivated topic demonstrative may combine reference to an S/O and to the action itself,
as in 10.69. It supplies an aspectual overtone of ‘here and now; ongoing action’ to a verb
marked with action focus. Similar examples are under 10.56 and 10.78.
  The versatile tense may refer to an ongoing event, as in 12.2; or to an event that took place
just recently, as in 12.3.
12.2 wun-a           yi-n   yi-tua
     I-3fem.sgnom go-seq come-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt

     bad-lk       road-3masc.sgnom be.closed-fully-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is a bad road, I have closed it oﬀ’
                                                12.1 Non-future tenses and action focus        255The recent past reference of the versatile tense can be highlighted by the temporal adverb b@
‘already’:
12.4 [wun ka:m yasa-l@-k],                  [d@-k@-di kamna:gw-a:b b@
     I     hunger feel-3fem.sg-compl.ds he-poss-pl food-too        already
     k@-tua-di]
     eat-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
     ‘Having felt hunger, I have already eaten his foodstuﬀs’
   The versatile tense can also refer to immediate future, as in T3.8 where Os@lo is about to
kill all the snakes. Versatile tense forms are also used in generic statements, for example, about
psychological states. These involve the polysemous word mawul ‘the inside; spirit’ (see §21.4),
e.g. mawul samasa:m t@-na (inside much be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she frets, worries, feels
sorrow or concern’ (lit. she has much inside).
   The versatile tense cross-referencing, and not the past tense cross-referencing, is used with
the future and with the habitual aspect (which has an additional past tense marking). In terms
of functional markedness, the versatile tense can be considered the unmarked choice. Formally
speaking, both past and versatile tense are marked.","[278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"
"   Such ﬁne-grained distinctions in temporal relationships between clauses are characteristic
of other Ndu languages, such as Iatmul (see Staalsen 1972) and Ambulas (Wilson 1980: 72–4;
also see Roberts 1988, 1997).
   The only switch-reference-sensitive medial markers which form a same-subject/diﬀerent-
subject pair are the completive markers -ku and -k. Other markers do not have paired forms,
similarly to Iatmul and to Ambulas. The cotemporaneous and the immediate sequence marker
require that the subject of the clause they mark be the same as that of the subsequent clause.
This requirement may be understood as a consequence of topical continuity of same-subject
participants in such situations.
   In contrast, the markers with the meaning ‘as soon as (little temporal overlap)’ and ‘same
time as: consecutive overlap’ do not have the topical continuity requirement. Consequently,
their subjects do not have to be the same as those of a following clause.
   We will now discuss the semantics and the properties of each of the medial clause types one
at a time. Medial clauses can be embedded within one another and form a clause chain—this
is addressed in §18.10. In each section, dependent verb forms under discussion are underlined.                                   18.2 s equencing -nThe sequencing medial clause marker -n is the most general of all medial clause markers,
in terms of its semantics and usage. It indicates that the action of the dependent clause is
simultaneous with that of an adjacent or a main clause, or shows a signiﬁcant degree of
temporal overlap with it. In 18.1, the event of the clause marked with -n is simultaneous with
the main clause: as one road goes oﬀ to the left, another comes in on the right.
                                                                   18.2 Sequencing -n       44918.1 [nak aki-taba:r          væki:n]       [nak mapa-taba:r

     værad]
     come.in+3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘One (road) going oﬀ to the left, one comes in on the right’  In 18.2, the actions of the clauses marked with -n are simultaneous; they signiﬁcantly overlap
with the action of a subsequent clause, marked with the completive -k:18.2 [yi-ku],       [a-d@               na:gw {yaku-n yaku-n yaku-n}] [karya-n]
     go-compl.ss dem.dist-masc.sg sago wash-seq wash-seq wash-seq bring-seq
     [væk-a:m       væs@-br@-k]            [t@-d@-k],             [ata

     wa-br@-d]
     say-3dusubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘Having gone, as they washed-washed-washed that sago, as they brought (it), having
     stored it in a pot, it having stayed, then they said to him’   Repetition of the verb yaku- ‘wash’ marked with -n in 18.2 iconically reﬂects repetition of
the action (see §12.8.3, and examples there). The three occurrences of yaku-n are pronounced
as one intonation unit and belong to the same clause—this is why they are in curly brackets
(similar examples are at 12.77–9). No other medial verb form can undergo such repetition.
   In 18.2, the subject of the simultaneous clause marked with -n is the same as that of the
subsequent clause (marked with the completive -k). Not so in 18.3. In the third clause, the
sequential form with -n is repeated four times. There is an intonation break between the second
and the third clause which is indicative of a clause boundary. The vowel of the verb in the
second clause is lengthened, iconically reﬂecting the distance to be travelled:18.3 [an     yi-k@-ta                           aka],                      [yi:n], [yi-n

     go-seq go-seq go-seq middle-lk-road+lk+loc road+lk-3dunom+lk two
     ‘This is how we two will go, as (we) go, as (we) go-go-go-go, in the middle of the road
     there are two roads’   As can be seen from 18.3 and numerous other examples, ‘simultaneity’ of the dependent
clause is only one of the meanings of the sequencing suﬃx -n. Its general implication is that
the event was concomitant to some other event—as in 18.3 where the characters were not
necessarily walking simultaneously with the two roads appearing in front of them. Similar
examples of concomitant events are at 14.105 and 14.109 (where the dependent clause follows
the main clause), and T1.33. In 14.110, the second clause marked with -n has additional
overtones of reason (‘since/as/while you did not come or were not coming’).
   Clauses marked with -n often reﬂect sequence of actions, as in 18.4—a suggestion by Tanina
that she should, as always, take my microphone down the stairs and put it down in the sun, so
that its solar panel could be recharged:18.4 [kar-da-n]         [taka-u]
     bring-down-seq put.down-1sgimpv
     ‘Shall I take it down(stairs) and put it down?’
450     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses  Here, the action of the dependent clause clearly has to precede that of the main clause. The
two form a closely knit sequence. A dependent clause marked with -n can refer to a process
which leads up to the result stated in the main clause, as in 18.5:
18.5 [wun war@-n] ñ@n-a-p@k                  t@-k-na-wun
     I       go.up-seq you.fem-lk-like become-fut-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I will grow to be like you’ (lit. I going up will be like you)
  Similar examples are 16.22, 18.6, and 16.19. All of these have an additional implication of
manner. Example 16.22 was an instruction to the little girl to drink water from a cup, and
not straight from the bucket where the water was stored. Example 18.6 refers to the way of
obtaining food.
18.6 [kamna:gw yapi:n] [k@-kwa-d]
     food        buy+seq eat-impv.3p-masc.sg
     ‘May he eat having bought/buying food’ or ‘May he eat through buying food (rather than
     growing his own)’
   A one-word clause marked with -n is akin to an adverbial modiﬁer. In 18.7, the dependent
clause can be translated as ‘being hidden’, or ‘in a secret way’.
18.7 [d@ pakw@-n]       k@-k@r
     he be.hidden-seq eat-des
     ‘He wanted to eat (stolen food) being hidden (himself)’ (or ‘in a secret way’)
  The -n marked forms of positional and motion verbs are often used to modify other verbs in
adjacent clauses, as in 18.8: here, the sequencing form of the verb s@b@n- ‘return, come back’
means ‘back’. A similar example is in the penultimate line of T2.40.
18.8 s@b@n@-n        ak@s       kui-kwa-na
     come.back-seq neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She never gives (things) back’
  Along similar lines, yi:n (go+seq) in 18.9 does not involve going anywhere—the meaning of
this form is ‘on and on’, and it is used to describe continuous crying for the drowned boy.
18.9 [gra-n gra-n napa-ku]                  [ga:m      s@-d@ka     s@-d@ka],
     cry-seq cry-seq compl.vb-compl.ss shouting plant-only plant-only

     ‘(We) having cried and cried, calling only, that Thursday. (As we went crying and calling)
     on and on, the night ﬁnished’
   These forms are being reinterpreted as adverbs; we return to the grammaticalization and
reinterpretation of medial verbs in §19.9.
   Speakers of Manambu tend to oﬀer sequencing forms marked with -n as citation forms of
verbs, e.g. væs@-n (step-seq) ‘to step’, væs kap@-n (grass cut-seq) ‘to cut grass’. These forms can
be used as S in verbless clauses, as in 18.10a–b, and 15.20:
18.10a [gu    tu:n            s@kul@k yi:n]      samasama yawi-a

       ‘Fetching water and cooking is a lot of work’
                                                                     18.2 Sequencing -n       45118.10b [wiyugw saku-n]             aka-n-aka

       ‘This is how is (done) opening (lit. pushing outside) a (traditional) door’
   Or they can head the predicate of a verbless clause, and take the appropriate nominal cross-
referencing:
18.11a væs kap@-n-a
       grass cut-seq-3fem.sgnom
       ‘This (activity) is cutting grass’
  A similar example in negative polarity is at 18.11b:
18.11b na:gw kur@n k@                      tami: ma:
       sago get+seq dem.prox.fem.sg area neg
       ‘There is no place to get sago in this area’
  They can also mark clausal complements of a transitive verb (as in 18.12) or of a ditransitive
verb (18.13) (see §19.8):
18.12 [ [a             ja:p kur@-n] ma: wa-k@-bra]                             [aw agwa
      dem.dist.fem.sg thing do-seq no say-fut-3dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt then which
      jap     k@-b@r-k@k@k]
      (thing) eat-3du-purp.ds
      ‘Then if they would refuse doing this thing, then what are they to eat?’
18.13 [family kulapu-n]      [vyakanaku-n] atawa skul
      family keep.tidy-seq improve-seq       thus school
      kui-yikwa-lwun
      give.to.third.p-hab.p-1fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Keeping the family tidy, improving (things), thus I taught (them to do)’ (lit. gave school)
  Sequencing forms marked with -n can be used on a par with noun phrases, similarly to action
nominalization. An example is at 18.14.
18.14 [kur-ma:r-k@-bra-di                  yawi adiya]                     [ñapwi
      do-neg-fut-3dusubj.vt-3plbas.vt work dem.dist.react.top+pl ﬁrewood
      m@wi             yi-n    kur-@n karya-n] [gu        m@wi              tu:n
      things.like.that go-seq get-seq bring-seq water things.like.that fetch.water+seq
      wiya:r            kawar@-n]    [k@ jap atawa akw@r]
      house+lk+all carry.up-seq this thing thus impv+do
      ‘The work they won’t do, things like going getting carrying ﬁrewood and things like that,
      fetching water (and) carrying it up to the house and things like that, do these things! (she
      usually kept telling them)’
  The sequencing forms are not really noun-like in any other way. Unlike action nomi-
nalizations (see §9.1.1), the sequencing forms cannot take any cases, be part of an NP, or
occur with modiﬁers. And we can recall, from §17.1.1, that the sequential form -n is also
used in aspectual complex predicates. This is also the citation form (cf. 16.108). There is no
doubt that it is a verbal form, and the most polyfunctional of all medial verb forms in the
language. As it occurs in a wide variety of contexts, it can be considered the least functionally
marked.
452     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses       18.3 c o m p l e t i v e - k u ‘ s a m e s u b j e c t ’/ -k ‘ different subject ’The completive medial markers -ku/k indicate that the action of the dependent clause was fully
completed before the start of the action of an adjacent or a main clause. An example of same
subject in the dependent and the main clause is at 18.15, and of diﬀerent subject at 18.16.
18.15 [vya-ku]      [k@-k@-bana-b@r]
      kill-compl.ss eat-fut-1plsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
      ‘Having killed (them) we will eat them two’
18.16 [ata wa-tu@-k]             [k@-di         ñan-ugw asa:y ata wa:d]
      thus say-1sg-compl.ds dem.prox-pl child-pl father thus say+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘After I’d said thus, the father of these children said thus’
   The use of same or diﬀerent subject is frequently triggered by an adjacent clause which may
itself be a dependent clause. An example is at 18.17. Switch-reference in clause chaining helps
keep track of who did what to whom—this is especially important in the case of third person
participants. The subject of the ﬁrst clause in 18.17 is the same as that of the second clause. But
the subject of the main clause is diﬀerent from that of the following clause which happens to
be the main clause.
18.17 [d@-k@-d@        ñan gu       k@-ku]              [kiya-d@-k]            [ata
      he-poss-masc.sg child water consume-compl.ss die-3masc.sg-compl.ds then
      gra:d]
      cry+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘After/because hisi sonj had died after/because hej drowned (lit. consumed water) hei
      (father) cried’
  This example highlights the inherent ambiguity of the completive medial clauses—they may
express temporal sequence and also reason. The completive verb construction is used as a
means of disambiguation—see §18.9.
  A chain of clauses with subject change is often much longer than this. Example 18.18 is a
rather typical lengthy clause chain. Further examples include T2.4–5 and T2.13–17.
18.18 [ata a-di          m@d        day-a-di m@d-a             sap kay-puti-ku]
      then dem.dist-pl cassowary they-lk-pl cassowary-lk skin caus-take.oﬀ-compl.ss

      m@y-a ta:kw patiaku-ku]               [t@-di]
      real-lk woman turn.into-compl.ss stay-3plbas.p
      ‘Then after those cassowaries took oﬀ their cassowary skins, after they put them down,
      they (the skins) stayed (there), after they (cassowaries) then having turned into real
      women, they (cassowaries) stood (there)’
   A dependent medial clause can be postposed to the main clause, as is the second clause in
18.19. This clause has the same subject as the main clause, and forms one intonation unit with
it. We return to this later on in this section. A pause separates second and third clause. Note
that the subject of the third clause is the same as that of the subsequent, fourth, clause.
18.19 [abra                  da-b@r]         [da-ku]           [pause]
      dem.dist.react.top+du go.down-3dubas.p go.down-compl.ss [pause]
      [ka-war-taka     wiya:m],      [ñ@g         ka-sapwi-d@-k]

                                18.3 Completive -ku ‘same subject’/-k ‘diﬀerent subject’        453      ‘The two went down, having gone down; immediately on carrying them up (into the
      house), after he opened the mosquito net [after they went inside the net, the other two
      then sewed the net across with a needle, having sewn it across, having put (the needle)
      on top of the bench, he sat (there)]’
  That is, switch-reference is a powerful means for tracking referents (see Roberts 1988, 1997).
Further examples of diﬀerent-subject completive are at 7.1, 7.72, 17.31, and 19.31, and of
same-subject completive are at 7.18, 7.21, 7.28, 14.111, 14.142, 17.28, and 19.3. Examples 17.4,
T2.4–5, and T2.13–18 illustrate lengthy clause chains where the subject change is marked with
switch-reference-sensitive suﬃxes.
  If a clause marked as same subject is followed by another clause also marked as same subject
this implies that there is no subject change, as in 18.20.
18.20 [ [s@r     yi-k@-bana]                       wa-ku]         [val  kur-ku]
      tomorrow go-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-compl.ss canoe get-compl.ss
      [adiya                  yi-di]
      dem.dist.react.top+pl go-3plbas.p
      ‘Having said: “We will go tomorrow”, having got the canoe, they went’
  In contrast, if two clauses—each carrying diﬀerent-subject completive marker and identical
person markers—are consecutive, the subject does not have to change. This is in fact a means
of linking two dependent completive clauses. Consider 18.18 above: second clause ‘after they
put’ and third clause ‘after they’d stayed (that way)’ are both marked for diﬀerent subject
because their subjects are diﬀerent from that of the following clause ‘having changed into’.
This is particularly obvious if the same clause is repeated, either slightly rephrased, as in 18.21,
or verbatim, as in T3.37.
18.21 [kar-da-n]         [taka-d@-k               ya:m],         [numa-d@      ya:m
      bring-down-seq put-3masc.sg-compl.ds ﬁre+lk+loc big-masc.sg ﬁre+lk+loc
      taka-d@-k],               [t@p-a      du-ta:kw      ata wa-di]
      put-3masc.sg-compl.ds village-lk man-woman then say-3plbas.p
      ‘After he’d put (the snake) into the ﬁre bringing it down, after he put (it) into a big ﬁre,
      village people then said (“What a big snake!”)’
   The second clause of 18.21 is an infrequent example of a non-verb-ﬁnal order in a medial
dependent clause.
   In contrast, a sequence of two clauses each marked for diﬀerent person of diﬀerent subjects
implies that the subjects are indeed diﬀerent, as in 17.4 (second and third clauses). Alterna-
tively, if the cross-referencing is the same, but participants are diﬀerent, at least one of them
tends to be stated with an overt NP. In T3.37, the main character, a woman, is the subject
of the ﬁrst clause—hence the feminine singular cross-referencing. The subject of the third
clause is diﬀerent from that of the ﬁrst clause, but, since night is feminine (see §5.2), it also
requires feminine cross-referencing. To indicate that the two ‘feminine’ participants—‘night’
and ‘woman’—are diﬀerent, ‘night’ is overtly stated.
   We will see, in §20.4.2, that a clause chain can be interrupted by ya:kya or ya:k ‘all right,
OK’ whose major function is to indicate that a certain time has elapsed between the actions of
the two adjacent clauses. Such interruption also allows the speaker to regain their breath.
   Just as in many languages with switch-reference, establishing what counts as same and as
diﬀerent subject is not always straightforward. If the subject of the ﬁrst clause is part of a
(non-singular) subject of the subsequent clause, the two subjects tend to be treated as same. In
454     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses18.22, the subject of the ﬁrst clause is the son, and the subject of the third, ﬁnal clause is the
son and his mother. The medial dependent clauses are marked for same subject.
18.22 [d@-a:b-a             kamna:gw k@-ku]                 [d@-ab-a             gu

      k@-ku]               [ata r@-b@r]
      consume-compl.ss then stay-3dubas.p
      ‘After he (son: not anyone else) too had eaten food, after he (son: not anyone else) too
      had drunk water, they two (son and mother) then stayed (there)’
   Not so in T2.13: Sesawi who had struck the slit gong was among those Avatip men who got
together and went oﬀ to ﬁght the Gala hiding on top of a tree. Yet his association with his
fellow villagers was not as close as that of a mother and a son; hence diﬀerent-subject marking.
   Two quite diﬀerent referents may acquire same-subject marking if they take part in a closely
knit event (see Reesink 1983, on similar phenomena in other Papuan languages). In 18.23, the
subjects of the second and the third clause are diﬀerent—yet they are marked as if they were
the same since the sub-events happened almost simultaneously, and the second clause was the
direct reason for the third clause: the narrator looked around scared as she had heard the sound
of something exploding:
18.23 [ar waku-n]       [pou                na-ku],          [wun
      lake go.out-seq sound.of.explosion be:nat-compl.ss I

      dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg look.across.away see-compl.ss then say-1fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Going out to the lake, noise of explosion having occurred, I having looked across away
      (to see what’s happening), then said’
   We can recall, from §17.4 (especially example 17.60) that body part constructions expressing
feelings or states within dependent clauses require diﬀerent-subject cross-referencing even
though the experiencer is the same person. Once in a dependent clause, the experiencer is
backgrounded, and not cross-referenced on the verb of feeling. A diﬀerent-subject sequencing
marker is then required. A typical example is at 18.24—the same people felt thirsty, went down
to the lake, and drank water:
18.24 [gu    yasa-l@-k],                      [a-d@              gu    ata da-ku]
      water be:desire-3fem.sg-compl.ds dem.dist-masc.sg water then go.down-compl.ss
      [t@-ku],         [ra:n       k@-br@-d]
      stand-compl.ss sit+seq consume-3dusubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Having felt thirsty (lit. after water felt), having descended onto water, having done so,
      they two drank it sitting’
  However, body part constructions can be treated as containing the same subject in terms of
switch-reference, if the subject is highly topical, as is the pronominal subject wun in 18.25:
18.25 [wun ya-tua-l-a]                                      [wun-a       ta:kw atawa bap

      [ya-na-d@wun-@k]
      come-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
      ‘It is the case that I have come, because my wife saw the moon (that is, menstruated),
      this is why having become angry (lit. belly having cried), I am coming’
                                18.3 Completive -ku ‘same subject’/-k ‘diﬀerent subject’         455   In 18.26, m@l ‘eye’ appears in a body part construction with puk@-puk puk@-puk ‘bulge and
bulge’ (see §12.8.3, on the function and meaning of repetition here). The character, who had
been hiding in a hollow sago tree, is the topic of this stretch of discourse: he had just been
found by an enemy, and is asking the enemy to kill him straight away (this is from a diﬀerent
version of Text 2, told by another speaker). The reactivated topic marker ad@ka in the third
clause refers to the topical participant, the subject of ‘say’:
18.26 [m@l puk@-puk puk@-puk na-ku]                     [wa-ku],
      eye bulge-red bulge-red be:nat-compl.ss say-compl.ss
      [ad@ka                          wa:d],                 [wun-a:m        avi        ya],
      dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg say+3masc.sgbas.p I-lk+acc/loc impv+kill emph

      ‘His eyes bulging out, (he) saying, he (topical) said: “Kill me, after you’d hit me to death
      may I die”. He, “that?” ’ (meaning: no way)’
   The completive dependent clause has here an additional, recapitulative, function. The same-
subject completive form of the dependent verb appears after the main verb, forming one
intonation unit with it, indicating the completion of the action of the main verb. Such com-
pletive dependent forms never express causal meanings. An example is at 18.27. Curly brackets
indicate that the inﬂected verb in the main clause forms one intonation unit with the verb in
the following same-subject dependent clause.
18.27 [t@-d@-k],                  [kula:r a-d@              na:gw ata
      stand-3masc.sg-compl.ds axe         dem.dist-masc.sg sago then
      {vya-pravi-d@-d],                             [vya-pravi-ku]},
      hit-be.hollow-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p hit-be.hollow-compl.ss
      [waku-d@-l]
      go.out-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘After he (Kamkudi) had been (there), after he (Sesawi) completed splitting that sago
      (tree) open (lit. hit open—having hit open), he (Kamkudi) went out (of the sago tree) at
      that (time)’
   A similar example is at the penultimate clause of T2.40 (kur-ku yi-ku get-compl.ss go-
compl.ss). We will see, at §19.5, that such recapitulating constructions are particularly frequent
with speech reports, e.g. wa-tua wa-ku (say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-compl.ss) ‘I said’ (lit.
I said saying) (e.g. 19.74). One additional function of this repetition is to stress that a speech
act actually took place: speech reports in Manambu are used in a wide variety of meanings not
all of which involve a speech act.
   Alternatively, the same-subject form of the verb t@- ‘stand, be’ can be used in the meaning
of ‘after that’, literally, ‘having been (like that)’. This form often follows a dependent clause, as
in second and third clauses in 18.24—note that the sequence of verbs {da-ku t@-ku} (go.down-
compl.ss stand-compl.ss) are pronounced as one intonation group. A similar example is at
18.28: the recapitulating t@-ku occurs twice:
18.28 [atawa war@-d                yawi] [a-di       yawi {war-ku]

      concerned, these people from the Maliau clan cut and carried (sago) down up until
      here’
   The form t@-ku operates almost like a connective ‘thus, and so’. We will see, in §19.6, that
this form is indeed in the process of grammaticalizing as part of a connective: al@k t@-ku
(dem.dist.fem.sg+dat stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so, as a result’.
It is pronounced as one phonological word.
              18.4 c o t e m p o ra n e o u s c lau s e m a r k e d w i t h -ta:yCotemporaneous clauses indicate the action of the dependent clause which started before that
of an adjacent or a main clause and overlaps with it. The suﬃx -ta:y could be related to the
adverb ta:y ‘before’ (§4.4).
  A dependent clause marked with -ta:y in 18.29 describes an action which started before that
of the main clause, and continued after the action of the main clause had started, overlapping
with it:
18.29 [k@-ta:y]   [wa-na-b@r]

      ‘They two talk while eating’ (they started eating before they started talking)
  Yuaneng instructed Benji to put on a shirt we’d just given him as a present, and to come

   The ancestors of the Makem clan have been killing ﬁsh and eating it on their own without
telling their relatives from Avatip. The killing of the ﬁsh has obviously started prior to them
not telling the other lot about it (ﬁrst clause of 18.31a). In 18.31b (which follows 18.31a in the
same story), killing ﬁsh had started before ‘eating on their own’; the eﬀect of -ta:y in the ﬁrst
clause is that they kept killing and eating the ﬁsh:
18.31a [k@-di        Mak@m           d@y-a-d@        warag-a-du

It is instructive to compare the three medial clause types we have discussed so far, in terms of
their semantics—which is not always easy to render in a translation into English (let alone Tok
Pisin).
   We can recall, from 18.7, that [d@ pakw@-n] k@-k@r (he be.hidden-seq eat-des) means ‘He
wanted to eat (stolen food) being hidden (himself)’ (or ‘in a secret way’). If a completive form
is used, [d@ pakw@-ku] k@-k@r (he be.hidden-compl.ss eat-des) would mean ‘He wanted to eat
(stolen food) after having hidden (himself)’. With a cotemporaneous form, the meaning would
be subtly diﬀerent again: [d@ pakw@-ta:y] k@-k@r (he be.hidden-cotemp eat-des) means ‘He
wanted to eat (stolen food) having been hidden (before he ate, or before he expressed his desire)
and staying hidden while eating’.
   With an example like 18.32a–b, the diﬀerence is rather more illustrative (compare 18.8):
18.32a s@b@n-ku            ak@s       kui-kwa-na
       come.back-compl.ss neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Having come back she never gives (things)’
18.32b s@b@n-ta:y      ak@s      kui-kwa-na
       come.back-seq neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘As she is coming back, she never gives (things)’
  The cotemporaneous -ta:y has an overtone of action or state stretching over time, as in
14.114, 12.37, and T3.43. Two clauses marked with -ta:y can be juxtaposed, with a sequential
eﬀect, as in 18.33. This is a description of the way of life of the Manambu people hiding in the
bush during the Japanese occupation of Avatip:
18.33 [m@y-a s@      ma: ku]           [amay-b@r      s@kul@k yi-da-k@r@b]

      ‘(We) did not really sleep. As mothers were cooking, every night going down taking us
      they would take us to the bush (to hide)’
  The verb or a sequence of verbs each marked with -ta:y can be repeated to describe an
action that goes on and on, as in 18.34, and T1.29. This is congruent with the general meaning
of repetition (see §12.8.3).
18.34 [ñ@n-a-di       ñan-ugw aw wun k@d@ka                                    {vya-ta:y]

      ‘Your children I will eat, killing-eating killing-eating’ (said the man taunting a snake)
  A sequence of verbs marked with -ta:y in 18.34 is pronounced as one intonation group
(marked with curly brackets). This is reﬂected in the English translation with a dash
458     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses(killing-eating) These verbs share not only the subject, but other arguments as well. Such
juxtaposed clauses form a clause union, similarly to above.
  Repeated cotemporaneous forms are often used as the only predicates in a clause (see §19.9
on desubordination). The semantic eﬀect is that of an action which keeps repeating itself, as in
4.33—a comment on me getting things and giving them away. Similarly, Celestin commented
on my habit of washing my teeth every time I ate anything:
18.35 {k@-ta:y    jan-ta:y}           {k@-ta:y jan-ta:y}
      eat-cotemp wash(part)-cotemp eat-cotemp wash(part)-cotemp
      ‘Eating-washing eating-washing’
   This is an example of a desubordinated clause—a dependent clause used on its own.
   Just like the same-subject completive form, the cotemporaneous form may have a recapitu-
lating function, adding the meaning of ‘keeping on and on’ to the main clause. Then, the same
verb as that of the main clause occurs in the cotemporaneous form postposed to it, forming
one intonation group with it (as in 4.33 ‘getting and giving’).
   Cotemporaneous forms can, just occasionally, head the predicate, taking the nominal cross-
referencing—just like a sequential -n (example 18.11a). The meaning is that of repetitive action.
18.36 gu    tu-ta:y-ad
      water fetch-cotemp-3masc.sgnom
      ‘He kept fetching water’
   Alternatively, one or several cotemporaneous dependent verbs can be used with t@- ‘stand’
as support verb. The meaning is that of an action that started before the moment of speech
and keeps going on and on. In 18.37, such a construction with four dependent verbs occurs
in a main clause, and in 18.38 it is used in a dependent completive medial clause. They
share all arguments. In terms of their intonation, they do not diﬀer from other -ta:y-marked
clauses.

      sago wash-cotemp stand-compl.ss look.across.away see-1sgsubj.p-3plbas.p
      ‘As I had been washing sago on and on across there on an island, I looked across here’
   As mentioned in §17.5, such structures can be analysed as complex predicates with a repet-
itive meaning whose action had started before the speech act. Their meaning is much more
straightforward than that of aspectual complex predicates (§17.1.1): the anterior, durative, or
prolonged durative meaning of the aspectual complex predicates arises from putting together
the -n-marked verb form accompanied by the appropriate auxiliary. In contrast, the repetitive
meaning of 18.37–8 is inherent to the cotemporaneous form.
   If the position, or duration of action, is to be speciﬁed, another positional verb can be used
as a support verb with a cotemporaneous form, e.g. r @- ‘sit’ as in 18.39 where the character is
in a sitting position.
                                    18.5 Immediate sequence clause marked with -taka          45918.39 [na:gw sau-ta:y]       [r@-na]
      sago fry-cotemp sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She is sitting frying sago on and on’ (she had started frying sago before the moment of
      the narrative)
   Examples 18.37–9 illustrate dependent verb forms heading a predicate and requiring a
support verb—just like any uninﬂected verb form would, if used in a dependent clause, or
if person, number, gender, and tense speciﬁcations are required.
   Similarly to the same-subject completive forms, cotemporaneous forms may become gram-
maticalized. The form wa-ta:y (say-cotemp) ‘that way; lit. having been saying’ is a case in point.
In 18.40, wa-ta:y has nothing to do with any speech act; just like t@ku ‘thus’ discussed at the
end of §18.3, it operates as a connective:
18.40 [ata r@-ta:y]          [k@-ta:y]   [ata wa-ta:y       tabu-dian]
      then sit/live-cotemp eat-cotemp then say-cotemp escape-1plbas.p
      ‘Then living (and) eating, that way we escaped (the Japanese)’
  Similar examples are at 12.59 and 18.33. The form ata wa-ta:y is often pronounced as one
word—see §19.6. This grammaticalization path is not surprising given the frequency and the
breadth of meaning of the verb wa- ‘say’—we return to this in §19.5.
            18.5 i m m e d i at e s e q u e n c e c laus e m a r k e d w i t h -takaThe medial clause suﬃx -taka is one of the four suﬃxes which are sensitive to the syllable
weight of the root and trigger iambic stress pattern (§2.4.2). The suﬃx has two allomorphs:
-taka with heavy roots and -ta-taka with light (CV) roots. This suﬃx requires the same subject
as the main clause. It indicates that the action of the dependent clause has been completed
and is immediately followed by that of an adjacent clause. In 18.41, the sorcerer opened the
stringbag with the baby in it the very moment he got hold of the bag. This idea of the ‘very
moment’ is captured by -taka:
18.41 [d@ a-d@              du yata-taka]         [wa:r      ada
      he dem.dist-masc.sg man carry-imm.seq string.bag dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg

      v@-d@-d]
      look-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘The man opened the stringbag he had carried and looked down into it’ (lit. ‘he that man
      immediately on carrying (the stringbag) having opened the stringbag by moving the sides
      apart, looked down (into the bag) (and put a spell onto the baby that was inside)’
Other examples are at 18.19, 16.19, and 16.29. A clause marked with -taka can be postposed to
the main clause, as in 14.115.
   Just as with the completive same-subject clauses (e.g. 18.20), a sequence of -taka clauses
share their subjects. An example is in T1.3.
   A -taka clause which is postposed to the main clause and contains the same verb as the main
clause has a recapitulative function, as in 18.42. The two verbs form one intonation unit, and
there is no intonation break between them. This is similar to the behaviour of a same-subject
completive clause (see 18.27).
460     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses18.42 [yi-n, yi-n, yi-n, ñ@d-@-yab@r                 ata {waku-di],

      go.out-imm.seq
      ‘Going going going onto the middle of the road they went out immediately on going
      out’
Unlike cotemporaneous clauses and sequencing clauses marked with -n, -taka clauses cannot
head a predicate. They hardly ever occur desubordinated (that is, without a main clause), and
are much less frequent in texts and conversations than medial clauses of other types.
          18.6 t e m p o ra l ov e r la p m a r k e d w i t h - k@b ‘ a s s o o n a s’The medial clause suﬃx -k@b is sensitive to the syllable weight of the root, and triggers the
iambic stress pattern (§2.4.2). The suﬃx has two allomorphs: -k@b with heavy roots and -k@-
k@b with light (CV) roots. A variant of -k@-k@b is -k@r@b (see A3 at §2.6). This suﬃx requires
diﬀerent subject; consequently the resulting verb is partially inﬂected. It indicates that the
action of the dependent clause is immediately followed by that of an adjacent or a main clause,
with a possible short temporal overlap between the two. In 18.43, as the Gala people were
eating ﬁsh (ﬁrst clause), as soon as the Avatip people had approached them (second clause,
marked with -k@b), the Gala started carefully putting together pieces of limbum palm leaves
(to hide the ﬁsh), and gave the Avatip people just coconuts to eat:
18.43 [k@-ta:y],    [Apat@p du væki-da-k@b],                [r@ka:r@k bæy

      ‘As they were eating, as soon as the Avatip men came across, they having carefully joined
      (pieces) of limbum (to hide the ﬁsh), gave them nothing but coconuts’
  A similar example is at T2.15: after the Avatip people had come (to ﬁght the Gala fugitives
hiding on top of the tree), as soon as the Avatip people cut the tree (marked with -k@k@b), while
the Gala people were throwing spears down from the tree, they (the Gala people) hit the shields
of the Avatip men. Further examples are at 10.59, 12.80, and 16.78.
  Adjacent clauses marked with -k@b may have diﬀerent subjects, if the verbs are next to each
other as in 18.44 (clauses 4 and 5), or same subjects (as in clauses 5 and 6) if they are not.

      usually play (with these seeds)’
  Only if adjacent clauses contain the same verb, as in 18.44, are the subjects the same. Note
that they have to be diﬀerent from those of the next clause. The constituent in slashes / / in the
ﬁrst clause in 18.45 is a complex predicate with a prolonged durative meaning (§17.1.1).
18.45 [ñan-a t@p-a:m           walimaudi /waku-n        kwa-d@-k@k@b/]

      fall-time
      ‘In our village as soon as the Rainbow keeps coming out and stays in the sky, that is the
      time of rain’
   This is similar to the behaviour of the diﬀerent-subject completive -k in adjacent clauses:
18.43 is similar to 18.18, and 18.44 is reminiscent of 18.21.
   Unlike other medial clause markers, -k@b can combine with -ta:y ‘cotemporaneous’. The
sequence -ta:y-k@b and its variant -ta:y-k@r@b (always in this order) has the same subject as the
following clause, and refers to the action that started before the action of the following clause
and overlaps with it. The subject is the same, because -ta:y is the same-subject marker:
18.46 [abakapi wuka                                da-ta:y-k@r@b]             [ñan-ugw

      ‘The hawk as soon as she has descended here (close to you: she’d started descending
      before the moment of narrative), ate up the children (of the chicken)’
  A similar example is in T3.8. The medial verb forms marked with -k@b can head a predicate,
as shown in 18.47.
18.47 n@k@            k@k@pa:t n@k@           k@k@pa:t

      ‘(This was) as soon as he’d given (them) various sorts of foodstuﬀ’
  This is the only circumstance when it occurs desubordinated.
                     18.7 c aus a l c lau s e s m a r k e d w i t h -l@kThe predicate of causal clauses takes the suﬃx -l@k which is not switch-reference sensitive.
This suﬃx is a product of recent grammaticalization of the (functionally unmarked) distal
demonstrative feminine dative a-l-@k ‘for that feminine’. We can recall, from §7.4, that causal
meaning is congruent with the meaning of the dative case. The form al@k ‘this is why’ is also
used as a clausal connective (see §19.6).
  The causal medial forms diﬀer from all other medial forms. They can be considered fully
inﬂected, because they occur with main clause tensed subject cross-referencing for A/S (see
462     18 Clause Linking and Dependent ClausesTable 11.2). However, unlike the inﬂected verbs in main clauses, no second argument can be
cross-referenced. Alternatively, the lack of second argument cross-referencing can be under-
stood as Ø-cross-referencing which corresponds to feminine singular basic non-subject. This
agrees with the functionally unmarked character of the feminine singular choice.
   This is understandable, from a historical perspective: the second position after the tensed
subject cross-referencing is ‘occupied’ by the ‘reason’ marking. We can conceive of the Ø-cross-
referencing as reﬂecting the ‘reason’.
   Unlike other medial clauses, dependent causal clauses can contain verbs marked with the
habitual aspect (as in T1.24), and with the action focus, as in 18.48.
18.48 [wañ wuli-yi-n         kwa-na-l@k]                             [wun-a

  Some speakers use non-tensed subject markers—rather than tensed ones—in causal clauses,
thus making them more similar to other dependent clauses. An example is at 14.116—Kulanawi
said kwar-ma:r-tu-l@k (get.neg-neg.dep-1sg-‘because) ‘because I did not get (a letter)’ using
the non-tensed form -tu- rather than -tua (subj.vt) or -tu@ (subj.p). This is in contrast to 18.49
where a more frequent tensed form is used.

      (said the ﬂying fox)
Uninﬂected verbs in causal clauses require a support verb. Causal clauses are negated with
the suﬃx -ma:r, just like all other dependent clauses—see 14.55 and 14.116 (this example
contains a causal clause postposed to the main clause). Desubordinated causal clauses are
ungrammatical.
   A causal medial clause is compatible with the connective al@k ‘this is why’ in the main
clause—as shown in 18.49. We return to clause linking involving connectives in §19.6.
                           18.8 u n l i k e ly c o n d i t i o n -ga:yA medial clause marker -ga:y, with the meaning of unlikely condition, ‘if, in an (unlikely) case’,
requires the same subject as that of the following clause and forms an uninﬂected verb. Medial
clauses marked with -ga:y take part in a construction involving the root form of the verb with
the suﬃx -ga:y followed by the same verb in whatever form is appropriate. In 18.50, it is rather
unlikely that we might have to go away; the -ga:y form is followed by future. The ﬁrst clause is
a juxtaposed dependent clause, and is marked with intonation (see §19.1):

by a dependent completive medial verb marked for diﬀerent subject:18.51 [wa-su-ga:y wa-su-da-k]                [yabi:b wuk@-nak]

      ‘Just in case they call up (to the house where we are), let’s quickly listen’  In 13.84, the -ga:y form is followed by a dative-aversive-marked nominalization. No other
constituent can intervene between the verb marked with -ga:y and the other verb. A -ga:y form
cannot be negated. It can be used in a negative construction: 18.52 is an example of the ‘unlikely
condition’ marker occurring in the same clause as a dependent conditional clause introduced
by the adverb k@pa:b ‘in case’ (see §13.7 and §14.5.1). We can recall, from §14.5.1 (especially
example 14.126), that such dependent conditional clauses are negated with a reduplicated
dependent clause negator -marmar-. This same negator appears in 18.52:18.52 [k@pa:b ya-ga:y         ya-marmar-@k]           al@k       samasama kamn:agw

      s@kul@k yi-tukwa
      cook      go-proh.gen
      ‘Just in case if they do not come, this is why do not cook a lot of food’   ‘Unlikely condition’ clauses are rare in all genres of texts, and in conversations. We will see
in §19.1 how other conditional meanings are expressed.                        18.9 ge n e r i c c o m p l e t i v e v e r b napa-The completive auxiliary napa- forms a complex predicate with a verb marked with the
sequencing suﬃx -n. No other constituent, including ata ‘then’, can intervene between the two
components. The order can never be reversed: clauses containing napa- are strictly verb ﬁnal.
They cannot be negated. A clause containing napa- can be postposed to the main clause (see
17.25b).
   Using the completive auxiliary is a way of emphasizing that the activity or part of it has been
ﬁnished. This strong overtone of ‘over and done with’ associated with napa- was corroborated
by the paraphrases by some consultants. When helping me transcribe a variety of Manambu
narratives, Jennie Kudapa:kw consistently rephrased all the occurrences of napa- with wapa-
‘leave, stop’. In her own speech, she used napa- and wapa- as synonyms. (A cognate could be
naap in Wosera/Ambulas, meaning ‘fall’.)
   Medial clauses containing complex predicates with the completive verb napa- have only
temporal meaning. This is in contrast to completive-marked dependent clauses (§18.3) which
may have a causal meaning: 18.53 refers to temporal sequence, and not to cause-eﬀect, while
18.17 is ambiguous. Complex predicates are in slashes.18.53 [d@-k@-d@         ñan /kiya-n napa-d@-k/]                      [s@b@n-@n

      ‘After/∗ because hisi sonj had died, after/∗ because hei came back, hei (father) sat in

464     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses   A vast majority of clauses containing napa- are marked with the completive medial clause
suﬃxes -ku (SS)/-k (DS). Further examples are at 12.81, 16.11, 16.39, 17.48, 18.9, and T2.13,
33, 35, and 37.
   Other medial clause aﬃxes—with the exception of the unlikely condition marker -ga:y
and the causal -l@k—also occur, but less frequently. In 18.54, a complex predicate with the
completive verb napa- appears in an immediate sequence clause marked with -taka: the focus
is on the completion of the action of eating food followed by washing:18.54 [a-di        kur-da-di             kamna:gw-adi] /kan            napa-taka/
      dem.dist-pl get-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p food-3plnom consume+seq compl.vb-imm.seq

      go-fut-act.foc-3plbas.p
      ‘As for those foods they brought on just having eaten them, after they’d entered the
      water, OK, they went oﬀ’   In 18.55 (a version of the story of the Gala war, similar to that in Text 2), napa- is used with
-ta:y ‘cotemporaneous’. The Gala people who were hiding on top of a tree would have got food
and eaten it down below; this process would be started and completed with some temporal
overlap with the action of climbing back up the tree, to hide:18.55 [kamna: m@wi              /kur@-n kan            napa-ta:y/]

      go.up-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p
      ‘As they have been getting food and things like that (and) eating they climbed up (the
      tree where they were hiding)’   Just like aspectual complex predicates (see the end of §17.1.1), a complex predicate with a
completive verb can contain two lexical verbs if they describe aspects of the same action, as
in 18.54. Alternatively, the lexical verb can be repeated as in 18.9. A complex predicate with
a completive verb cannot contain complex predicates of any other sort. A whole napa- clause
can never be repeated.               18.10 c laus e c h a i n i n g a n d s e n t e n c e s t ru c t u r eIn a language with extensive clause chaining a sentence contains one main clause and a series
of dependent medial clauses each of which speciﬁes relative tense with respect to the main
clause or to the adjacent clause. The resulting structure can be dauntingly lengthy and complex.
The head-tail linkage between sentences ensures coherence of the text itself, and enables the
listener to keep track of the sequence of subevents. Thus, the sub-events are presented as a
chain structure—each one connected to the next. T2.3–7 are a prime example of such a chain.
The average number of medial clauses per sentence is two to three, as in Texts 1–3. An unusually
long sentence with ﬁve medial clauses (all same subject) is in 18.56, from one of the numerous
versions of the story of Gala wars told by Walinum, a highly proﬁcient story teller.

      completely and fully), having cleaned the rubbish out of his teeth (lit. which was staying
      in his teeth), ears, and the inside of the nose, he cleaned him completely’
  A lengthy chain is often interrupted by ya:kya, or its variant ya:k ‘OK, all right’, or Tok
Pisin orait, as in T2.17. We return to the use of ya:kya in §20.4.2.
        19        Other Dependent Clauses and Further
        Features of Clause LinkingWe will now discuss clause-linking devices other than clause chaining via medial dependent
clauses (see Aikhenvald forthcoming g, on their semantics). These include: juxtaposition of a
dependent clause and a main clause (§19.1); relative clauses (§19.2); clause linking via a case
marker ‘instead’ and a suﬃx ‘like’ (§19.3); purposive and desiderative clauses (§19.4); speech
reports (§19.5); clause linking involving connectives (§19.6); and juxtaposition of main clauses
(§19.7).
   Manambu does not have complement clauses as a type on their own. Some types of medial
dependent clauses, juxtaposed clauses, purposives, desideratives, speech reports, and nominal-
izations can be used as complementation strategies—see §19.8. Dependent clauses can be used
as main clauses. This phenomenon, known as desubordination, is addressed in §19.9, together
with grammaticalization and reinterpretation of ‘medial’ verbal forms.
   Table 19.1 features a comparison of dependent medial clauses, juxtaposed dependent clauses,
relative clauses, and main clauses in terms of their constituent order, predicate head possibil-
ities, and tense, aspect, and moods expressed. Relative clauses are more similar to juxtaposed
clauses than to clauses of the other two types.
   A constituent in a medial completive clause can be questioned, as in 10.80 and 9.33. This is
a special property of these clauses which sets them apart from all other dependent clause types,
especially relative and conditional clauses (see §10.4).     19.1 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f a de p e n d e n t c laus e a n d a m a i n c laus eJuxtaposed clauses are a type of dependent clause with no segmental marking. Juxtaposed
clauses are preposed to a main clause. They mark absolute tense (unlike medial dependent
clauses whose tense is relative to that of the main clause). All aspect and tense distinctions
of main clauses can be expressed. Similarly to dependent clauses in general, and unlike main
clauses, juxtaposed clauses are negated with the subordinate negator -ma:r-. Uninﬂected aspec-
tual and modal forms require a support verb to be able to be used in juxtaposed clauses.
   A striking feature of juxtaposed clauses is their rising intonation contour with the pitch
going up on the last syllable of the predicate. This intonation contour may be the only
feature that distinguishes positive juxtaposed dependent clauses from juxtaposed main clauses
discussed at §19.7. Juxtaposed clauses are strictly verb ﬁnal.
   Juxtaposed clauses often express condition. Examples with a positive clause expressing
counterfactual condition via irrealis marking are at 13.35–6 and 14.55–7 (also see §13.3 and
§14.3.1 on irrealis in positive and in negative clauses). Examples expressing real condition are
14.58, 14.123–4, and 18.12. As shown in 14.56, whether the condition is counterfactual or not
may depend on the context, given the inherent ambiguity between irrealis and future. Example
19.1 may have either of three meanings: ‘if I had gone, I would have told you (the secret)’,

468      19 Other Dependent Clauses‘if I go, I will tell you (the secret)’, or ‘when I go, I will tell you (the secret)’. In the actual
context, the second reading was the most appropriate: the speaker had not yet gone, was not
sure if she was going, and telling the secret depended on her going to another village and
learning the details:
19.1 [wun yi-k@-tua]                         [ñ@n-a:k
     I       go-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt you.fem-lk+dat
     wa-k@-tua]
     say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘If I go, I will tell you (the secret)’
   That is, a real-condition reading is appropriate in 19.1. This is in contrast to -ga:y ‘unlikely
condition’ (§18.8) which always has a conditional reading. Similar examples are at T3.23 and
T3.25.
   Alternatively, a juxtaposed clause may have a purely temporal meaning. An example is at
19.2: we know that it is not conditional because of the context of the story: the man is bound
to hit the road to go back home. This example shows that a juxtaposed clause can be postposed
to the main clause, just like most other dependent clauses.

     ‘Having put (the mangoes together), do not ever half-open the stringbag as you go onto
     the road’
  A similar example is in the ﬁrst clause of T3.43. Here, the juxtaposed clause cannot possibly
have a conditional reading.
  A juxtaposed clause does not have to be contiguous with the main clause: in 19.3 a cotempo-
raneous clause intervenes between a juxtaposed clause and a main clause. This same example
shows that a juxtaposed dependent clause can itself contain a medial clause. The ‘relative tense’
of the medial clause is determined by the absolute tense of the juxtaposed clause.

   Juxtaposed clauses are similar to main clauses in most ways, except negation. No such
clauses have been documented in related languages. This clause type may constitute a recent
innovation.
                                  19.2 r e lat i v e c lau s e sRelative clauses (see Table 19.1) involve an inﬂected verb—see §19.2.1. An alternative relativiza-
tion strategy is verb-noun compounding—see §19.2.2. The two are compared in §19.2.3.
                                                                    19.2 Relative clauses       469                       19.2.1 Relative clauses with an inﬂected verbRelative clauses in Manambu are restrictive. The main clause and the relative clause must have
an argument in common. The shared argument can be stated in the main clause, but does
not have to be. It is not stated in the relative clause. Headless relative clauses are treated on
a par with any other constituents of the main clause. A relative clause typically follows the
demonstrative and precedes an adjective within an NP (see §20.1.1).
   Relative clauses share properties with a main clause: the predicate can be an inﬂected or a
partially inﬂected verb. Similarly to other dependent clauses, no predicate head other than a
verb can be used in a relative clause. Uninﬂected verbal forms and non-verbal predicate heads
require a support verb (typically, t@- ‘stand/be’) (see §17.2).
   Relative clauses are strictly verb ﬁnal. All tenses, aspects, and modalities can be expressed.
Unlike medial dependent clauses, but similarly to juxtaposed dependent clauses, no constituent
within a relative clause can be independently focused. The predicate of a relative clause can have
one or two cross-referencing positions (following the same principles as in the main clauses: see
Chapter 3). It always requires the linker -@ after a word-ﬁnal stop. The last cross-referencing
position agrees with the common argument. Relative clauses are negated with the dependent
clause negator -ma:r-, just like other dependent clauses.
   Relative clauses have no special segmental marking. Monosyllabic verbs have a somewhat
special form in relative clauses. We can recall, from §11.3.2, that when monosyllabic verbs
consisting of CV, with a root vowel either @ or a, take a suﬃx and the resulting form is
monosyllabic, the root vowel is lengthened. And the verbs with vowel a and with @ are then
homophonous, e.g. r @- ‘sit’, ra- ‘cut’, and ra:d (sit/cut+3masc.sgbas.p) ‘he sat/cut’. When
such verbs appear in relative clauses, they do not undergo vowel lengthening and there is no
homophony, e.g. r @-d-@ du (sit-3masc.sgbas.vt/p-lk man) ‘man who sits/sat’, ra-d-@ du (cut-
3masc.sgbas.vt/p-lk man) ‘man who cut(s)’. The reason lies in the syllabic structure: since a
relative clause is in the modiﬁer slot to a noun, it requires a linker (see §4.1.1), and this linker
adds an extra syllable to a monosyllabic verb. Consequently, its root vowel remains unaltered.
   As we saw in Table 19.1, relative clauses are similar to juxtaposed dependent clauses. How-
ever, they lack a special rising intonation contour; instead they tend to form one phonological
phrase with the common argument. If used headlessly (as in 14.122 and T2.67) they have the
same phonological properties as any headless NP.
   Any core or peripheral argument, including locative, temporal, instruments, associated
arguments, and possessors, can appear as a common argument (CA) in a relative clause.
There are very few restrictions on the function of the common argument in a main clause.
Only the argument of the three postpositions k@t@k ‘like; similarly’, wuk@n ‘together with’, and
kuk@- ‘behind’ cannot be relativized on. This appears to go against the hierarchy established
by Keenan and Comrie (1977): according to the hierarchy, if a language can relativize on a
possessor, it is expected to relativize on the argument of an adposition. A tentative explanation
is oﬀered at the end of this section.
   The CA in A function in a relative clause and the S function in the main clause is shown
in 19.4. A similar example is at 14.122 (where a headless relative clause contains the CA in A
function, which is also in the A function in the main clause).19.4 a     [br@-k@-m   yaku-ya-l               ta:kw-a:b] [a

470      19 Other Dependent Clauses  In 19.5 the CA is in S function in the relative clause, and S in the main clause. A similar
example is in T1.31: the CA is the S of the relative clause, and the A of the main clause (‘(We)-
the people who stay on the earth see the moon’).19.5 [d@y-a-d@            ta:y waku-d-@                    yibun-mi] [tayir

in T1.26 (‘this is the moon who keeps shining all over this earth’), and at 14.118a–b.19.6 [væra-d-@                                   du]-ad

     ‘It is a man who is coming across towards (us)’  In 19.7 the common argument is an O in the relative clause and S in the controlling clause.
Note that the relative clause occurs together with an adjective ‘small’ in the same NP preceding
the adjective:19.7 [ [kwatiya-tua                                    kwasa        lapa-ñ@g]

relative clause and main clause. In 19.45, it is the O of the relative clause and a location in a
main clause. In 18.56 (‘having cleaned [ . . . ] the rubbish which was staying in his teeth’), the CA
is the S of the relative clause and the O of the main clause. This is also an example of a relative
clause within a dependent clause. A similar example is at 19.8: the CA is S of the relative clause
(with an aspectual complex predicate which has a transitivity-neutralizing eﬀect: §16.2.3 and
§17.1.1), and O of the main clause:19.8 [a-d@             t@p@-taka-n         r@-d-@                  kaw] ma: v@

     ‘He (the human child) did not see the hole which had been covered up’ (lit. ‘stayed closed’)   The ﬁrst line of T1.4 illustrates relativization on the addressee. The CA is in A function in the
main clause. A CA can be a nominal component of a lexicalized complex predicate noun-dat

ple is the Manambu term for stock exchange sa:n warapwi-dana tami: (money exchange-

§15.3.1. Also see the penultimate line of 16.40, and T3.19.

   In 19.11, the CA is an oblique with a temporal meaning in both relative clause and the main
clause.
19.11 ñ@n-a-d@              asa:y [Tani ma:k kwa-la-d-@                         nabi]

      ‘Your father died the year (when) Tanina was born (lit. person stayed)’
   The CA can be the second argument of the extended intransitive verb ‘say’ (see §19.5.5 on
its argument structure):

      ‘The village called Asiti is down there’
  In 14.119 the CA is an oblique with a causal meaning, and in 19.13 it is an oblique indicating
‘manner’:

      ‘I know the essence (lit. base) of their staying, the way in which those two women’s road

   And 19.14 illustrates the possessee, ‘dog’, as a common argument; it is the S of the main
clause:
472     19 Other Dependent Clauses19.14 [a-d@              wiya:m          s@     kwa-na-d-@                du]

      ‘The dog of that man who is sleeping in the house has already died’
   The argument structure and the marking of arguments in relative clauses is the same as
that in main clauses, unless the CA is the possessor closely associated with the possessee. Such
possessees include kinship relations, as in 19.15, body parts, as in 19.16, and physical states, as
in 19.17a–b. Then, the possessee is zero marked and preposed to the predicate of the relative
clause followed by the CA. That is, ‘men whose wives died’ are literally ‘wife they-died men’,
‘man whose hand you shook’ is ‘hand you-shook man’, and ‘boy whose fever goes up’ is ‘fever
he-goes up boy’:
19.15 [ta:kw kiya-di      du] [du kiya-di      ta:kw] [sarmabap-adi]

       asthma/breath go.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt woman+lk-child-3fem.sgnom
       ‘She is a girl with asthma’ (lit. asthma she-goes up girl)
  A similar relative clause construction occurs whenever a connection between the possessor
and the possessee can be conceived as close enough and culturally acceptable. That is, 19.18a
was judged possible, but 19.18b was treated as contrived, the reason being that children do not
really own mice or rats:
19.18a a:s kiya-d-@                 ñan
       dog die-3masc.sgbas.p-lk child
       ‘a child whose dog died’ (lit. dog he-died child, or child dead with respect to dog)
19.18b ?wakuli    kiya-d-@            ñan
       mouse/rat die-3masc.sgbas.p-lk child
       ‘a child whose mouse died’?
   The possessor in 19.15–18 can be in any function in a main clause. Its function in a relative
clause is the subject (S, as in 19.15, 19.17–18) or the object (as in 19.16): this function is
indicated by the person, number, gender, and tense markers on the predicate of the relative
clause. The possessees in the relative clauses in 19.15–18 are ambiguous as to their syntactic
functions: they can be considered part of the S in 19.15, 19.17–18, and part of O in 19.16.
                                                                   19.2 Relative clauses      473This creates an unusual clause type, only found in relative clauses involving relativization of
possessor.
   From a semantic point of view, the phenomenon of ‘extraction’ of an inalienably possessed
noun and change in its argument status is akin to the phenomenon known as double object
construction. For instance, in Tariana (Arawak: Aikhenvald 2003: 156–7) if a possessive con-
struction containing a body part or any inalienably possessed item is in a non-subject function
in a clause, both possessor and the possessee acquire the non-subject case marking and are
treated as objects. In constructions known as ‘external possession’, the possessor is coded as a
‘core grammatical relation of the verb and in a constituent separate from that which contains’
the possessee (see Payne and Barshi 1999: 3).
   We have just seen that in Manambu, relative clauses involving possession with a close
link between the possessor and the possessee have the surface structure of either double
subject or double object. And the relativization in Manambu appears to go against the NP
accessibility hierarchy proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977): the hierarchy predicts that if a
language allows relativization on possessors, it should also allow relativization on arguments
of adpositions. However, the analysis above suggests that in Manambu possessors need to be
transformed into either a subject or an object (depending on the function of the possessive
construction in the main clause), before they can be relativized. Possessors as such cannot
be relativized on. That is, relativization in Manambu does in fact conform to the hierarchy
suggested by Keenan and Comrie.
   If there is a close association between the process and the result, the ‘associated result’ can
also be relativized on. This is illustrated in 19.19: the man looked into the house and saw the
ﬁre lit by the woman (CA is O in the relative clause and in the main clause), and also saw what
literally translates as ‘the smoke that she was cooking’—that is, the smoke associated with, or
coming from, her cooking:19.19 [a                apaw       ta:kw aka
      dem.dist.fem.sg old.fem.sg woman dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg

      [a    k@tawul      v@-da]
      then look.inside see-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘He saw inside (the house) the ﬁre lit by that old woman, the smoke of her cooking (lit.
      cooking she-do smoke, or the smoke associated with her doing cooking)’  Along similar lines, 19.20 literally translates as ‘these are the pictures which they spoke at
a name debate called “saki” ’, meaning ‘these are the pictures to do with (that is, taken at the
time of) a name debate “saki” ’:19.20 [saki         bla-dana                         kayik]-adi
      name.debate speak-3plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt picture-3plnom
      ‘These are the pictures of them speaking at the name debate “saki” ’ (lit. name debate
      they-speak pictures)   There are no grammatical restrictions on the nature of an associated participant.
   Since any core argument can be relativized on, ambiguity may arise: 19.21 allows for two
interpretations—since both participants, the man and his companion, are marked with the
same third person singular masculine cross-referencing:
474      19 Other Dependent Clauses19.21 k@-d@             d@-k@-d@           poroman    [a-d@              vya-k

      say-3masc.sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt I       you-lk+acc/loc hit:fut neg
      ‘This companion of his said to that man who was about to hit him: “I won’t hit you” ’ or
      ‘This companion of his said to that man whom he was about to hit: “I won’t hit you” ’
  In the context of the story, only the second reading is appropriate. If the common argument
and the core argument(s) of the main clause require diﬀerent gender and number marking, no
ambiguity arises—see 19.28.
  Overt expression of participants in a relative clause is an alternative way of disambiguating
the role of the CA. A clause kwa-na-d-@ wi (stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house) is ambigu-
ous: adding an additional argument allows us to disambiguate between ‘a house that stays (is
located) on a hill’ and ‘a house where someone stays’:
19.22a [n@b@k@m        kwa-na-d-@                        wi]-ad
       hill+lk+loc stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house-3masc.sgnom

       man stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house-3masc.sgnom
       ‘It is a house where a man stays (lives)’
Any relative clause can be used without a head. If the head is omitted, the verb takes the
case marking which the common argument would have taken had it been there. In 14.122 the
headless relative clause, ‘(people) who do not work’, is in the A function of a main clause,
and in T2.67 (‘those we were talking about’) it is in S function. A dative case-marked headless
relative clause is illustrated in 19.23a. The omitted common argument is in the O function in
the relative clause, and in the function of second argument of the complex verb ‘ask’ which
requires dative marking:
19.23a g@ñ@r bas s@-k@-tua-di                         [a-di
       later ﬁrst plant-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt dem.dist-pl
       laku-mar-tua-di:k]
       understand-neg.sub-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt+dat
       ‘I will ask later about (the ones) I do not understand’
  If the CA had not been omitted, it would have taken the dative case:
19.23b g@ñ@r bas s@-k@-tua-di                        [a-di
       later ﬁrst plant-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt dem.dist-pl
       laku-ma:r-tua-di                            maj@k]
       understand-neg.sub-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt word+lk+dat
       ‘I will ask later about words I do not understand’
  And in 19.24a the omitted CA is an S in the relative clause. In the main clause it is a location,
marked with the comitative case (see §7.9). Since the CA is omitted, the case marking goes onto
the verb.
19.24a [a              væk r@-lawa]                             mæy
       dem.dist.fem.sg pot sit-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt+com come.impv
       ‘Come by the (area) where that pot sits’
                                                                    19.2 Relative clauses      475  If the CA had not been omitted, the sentence would be:
19.24b [a              væk r@-la                            tamiya-wa]  mæy
       dem.dist.fem.sg pot sit-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt area+lk-com come.impv
       ‘Come by the area where that pot sits’
   This is how what looks like a fully inﬂected verb can take a case marker (see §7.11, for
the discussion of case marking on verbs). A similar example is in T3.43, with a headless
relative clause ata wa-tua-di-a-wa (then say-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt-lk-com) ‘with those (the
words) which I was saying’.
   We can recall, from 19.7–8, that a relative clause follows a demonstrative and precedes an
adjective modifying a common argument. This same order holds if the CA is omitted, as in
19.25. The CA is the O function in both relative and main clause:
19.25 [a                    wuk@mar-tua]                        kwasa
      dem.dist.fem.sg forget-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt little+fem.sg

      dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg tell-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I will tell that little (bit of a story) which I forgot’
  A headless relative clause in an elliptical sentence looks exactly like a main clause would
look. A speaker heard a woman shout from the next-door house, and asked S@-k@-l-al? (who-
obl-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom) ‘Who is this?’ Gemaj answered 19.26:
19.26 anaki                            wiya:m          r@-na
      dem.curr.rel+across.away house+lk+loc sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘(It is the one who) lives in previously mentioned the house across from us (meaning our
      next-door neighbour Esther-Yuaya:b)’
   An alternative interpretation for this clause could have been ‘She lives in previously men-
tioned the house across from us’; but this interpretation would not have made sense under
the circumstances. That is, a headless relative clause—if it is not negated—can sometimes be
distinguished from a main clause by context only. If it is negated, it takes the dependent clause
negator -ma:r- which a normal main clause does not take (except under special circumstances:
§14.5.3). In addition, all relative clauses, including headless ones, can be used as complementa-
tion strategies—see §19.8.
   Relative clauses are very common in every genre of Manambu. An alternative strategy is
verb-noun compounds.","[475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502]"

              9.1.2 Other nominalizations and an adjectivizing derivationNon-productive action nominalizations involve the syllable-weight-sensitive suﬃx -ka:u ‘action
nominalization’: it requires that the root it combines with should contain at least one light and
one heavy syllable (in the sense of §2.4.2). This suﬃx has been attested with one disyllabic root
kak@l ‘surpass, exceed’; the resulting form kak@l-ka:u (surpass-nom.act) means ‘races, compe-
tition’ (as in 9.22). All other roots this suﬃx occurs with consist just of one heavy syllable (of
CVC structure); they have to undergo full reduplication. The resulting forms are g@p-@-g@p-@-
ka:u (run-lk-run-lk-nom.act) ‘running around’, t@p-@-t@p-@-ka:u (dive-lk-dive-lk-der) ‘div-
ing up and down’, and pakw-@-pakw-@-ka:u (hide(intr)-lk-hide(intr)-lk-nom.act) ‘hiding; hide
and seek’. A possible exception is rali-rali-ka:u (untie-untie-der) ‘game of untying (grass skirt)’,
as in kwa:r rali-rali-ka:u nayi-di (grass.skirt untie-untie-nom.act play-3plbas.p) ‘they played

186      9 Derivation and Compoundingat untying grass skirts’. The formative -ka:u in p@t@ka:u ‘ladder’ may also be related to this
morpheme. All the -ka:u derivations refer to a kind of game, or process. These nominalizations
cannot take case marking (see 7.14). They are freely used as heads of predicates as in 9.22, and
express unmarked purpose, as in 7.14. With the verb ‘play’ they refer to the game played, as in
9.23.

     ‘They played at running around (and) diving up and down’
   Unlike any other object it can never be cross-referenced on the verb. In these properties, it is
reminiscent of the nominal component of complex verbs.
   The suﬃx -kay derives an object nominalization from one root, yab@r- ‘fan (somebody)’,
producing yabr@kay ‘fan’. Two suﬃxes occurring with one root each derive adverbs: -sap as
in yanu-sap (magic-der) ‘by magic’ (this suﬃx is homophonous with one of the transportative
case markers: §7.7) and -naral as in takwanaral (woman+der) ‘(row or sit in a canoe) in a
woman’s fashion (for a man)’.
   The inﬁx -ka- ‘intensive’ accompanied by root reduplication is partly a word class-changing
derivation (see Table 4.2, and §4.3.2). It derives non-agreeing adjectives with intensive meaning
from numerous non-agreeing adjectives, e.g. s@mi ‘long’, s@mi-ka-s@mi ‘very long’. A few nouns
take this inﬁx, and the result is, in many cases, a non-agreeing adjective, e.g. laki ‘ginger’, laki-
ka-laki ‘green; ginger colour’. Some nouns refer to colours when used as modiﬁers, e.g. wa:m
‘white cockatoo; white colour’. When used with the inﬁx -ka-, these are used only as non-
agreeing adjectives, e.g. wama-ka-wa:m (white+lk-int-white) ‘very white’. Further examples
are in §4.3.2.
   The inﬁx -ka- when applied to nouns does not always derive an adjective: as mentioned in
§4.3.2, this derivation with ya:l ‘stomach’ results in yala-ka-ya:l (stomach+lk-int-stomach)
‘empty stomach’, as in 4.58.
                  9.2 no n-wo r d c la s s -changing derivationsManambu has a few adverb-speciﬁc derivational suﬃxes (§4.4) and derivational formatives
occurring on personal names (§5.3). Verbal formatives whose status is ambiguous between
derivational suﬃxes and parts of compounds are discussed in §15.2.4.
   Manambu has one non-word class-changing derivational suﬃx, a collective marker -ja:y
which applies just to nouns. This suﬃx has a fairly speciﬁc meaning: it deﬁnes a peer group
or a generation-based group of people, e.g. n@b@-takwa-ja:y (marriageable-woman+lk-coll)
‘young marriageable women’, naubadi-ja:y (young.man-coll) ‘young men’, du-a-ñanugw-a-
ja:y (man-lk-children-lk-coll) ‘a peer group of little boys’, takw-a-ñanugw-a-ja:y (woman-
lk-children-lk-coll) ‘a peer group of little girls’. This suﬃx is also used with kinship terms,
e.g. amay-br@-ja:y (mother-pl-coll) ‘peer group of classiﬁcatory mothers’, asay-br@-ja:y ‘peer
group of classiﬁcatory fathers’, jukwar-ugw@-ja:y ‘peer group of siblings’, ñaju-gwu-ja:y ‘peer
group of paternal uncles’, away-bra-ja:y ‘peer group of maternal uncles’.
   To refer to an exclusive group, the suﬃx -ja:y appears inﬁxed in between the reduplicated
parts of a fully reduplicated noun, as in takwa-ja:y-ta:kw (woman+lk-coll-woman) ‘a group
                                              9.2 Non-word class-changing derivations        187of women only’, ñanugw-a-ja:y-ñanugw ‘a group of children only’, and du-a-ja:y-du (man-lk-
coll-man) ‘a group of men only’.
    Forms containing this suﬃx have plural reference and require plural agreement. The suﬃx
itself requires a plural form of a noun it occurs with (if the noun has one). If the plural form
of a noun is archaic and restricted in usage, it cannot occur with -ja:y, e.g. tid@-takwa-ja:y
(co.wife+lk-woman+lk-coll) ‘peer group of co-wives’ (i.e. women of the same clan who are
either married to the same man, or are eligible to marry men from the same clan), but neither
∗
  tid-igw-ja:y nor ∗ takwagwa-ja:y (though the archaic forms tidi:gw ‘co-wives’ and takwa:gw
‘wives’ exist and occur in songs).
    Note that -ja:y- follows the plural marking in the forms above. This may be considered as
an exception to an oft-quoted tendency to place inﬂectional markers (such as plural) after
derivational markers. However, as shown in §6.1, number marking on nouns themselves in
Manambu is highly restricted and quite irregular. It can be argued that plural on nouns is a
derivation, and not an inﬂection.
    A collective form marked with -ja:y can modify a personal pronoun, as in 9.24; or occur in
S and in an oblique function, as in 9.25.9.24 [ñan kwasa-ñanugw-a-ja:y]               nay-@k      waku-dian

     men.house+lk-loc man-lk-coll-man stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt
     ‘A group of only men stay in men’s house’   A suﬃx of the same segmental form occurs on the command marker jau ‘let it drop’ (Tok
Pisin maski) resulting in the adverb jau-ja:y ‘any old way, carelessly’. It appears impossible to
decide whether the two ja:y are indeed instances of the same aﬃx, or diﬀerent aﬃxes.
   The unstressed non-productive derivational suﬃx -kara occurs with yara ‘all right’; the
resulting form is yara-kara ‘well’.
   Four further suﬃxes appear to form one morphological system. They can combine with
any word class (that is, they are low in selectivity), displaying somewhat diﬀerent properties
depending on the word class they occur with. Their properties are summarized in Table 9.2.
   All these suﬃxes require a linker (see §4.1.1). Third person singular and dual pronouns
require the linker -k@-, just as with case markers. One grammatical word cannot take more
than one of these suﬃxes—this is an argument in favour of them forming one morphological
system. However, they can occur on diﬀerent words within one NP, as shown in 9.34 below
(similarly to the way in which one noun phrase can contain two cases which occur on diﬀerent
words within one noun phrase, as in 7.71, where one is comitative and the other dative). We
discuss them one by one.
1. The suﬃx -d@ka ‘only, just, exactly’ can occur with members of any word class, with the
basic meaning ‘only, just’, e.g. takwa-d@ka t@p (woman+lk-only village) ‘village of women
only’, m@n-a-d@ka (you.masc-lk-only) ‘you only, just you’. A noun marked with -d@ka can
occur in any function. In 9.26, -d@ka occurs on an O and on a deictic adverb ‘like that’. The
suﬃx is pronounced as -da in rapid register (see §2.6).
   The suﬃx -d@ka ‘only’ is unstressed. When it is added to a noun or a verb, the stress moves
to the antepenultimate position, e.g. a:s ‘dog’, asá-d@ka t@p (dog+lk-only+lk village) ‘village
of only dogs’.

     ‘Just like that, silent, after she was carrying just her son on her breast . . . ’
   The form taba-d@ka (hand+lk-only) ‘hands only, carrying nothing’ can be used in any
function, including a manner modiﬁer, or even as an elliptical greeting, in the meaning of ‘give
me your hand to shake, let’s shake hands’ (a more conventional way of saying the same thing
is ta:b kuru (hand get+1sgimpv) ‘may I take (your) hand’—see §13.2). Only occasionally can
this suﬃx appear on a case-marked noun, as in gan@r-d@ka (night+lk+instr-only) ‘only/just
by night’.
   The suﬃx -d@ka can occur on the ﬁrst of a sequence of nouns repeated for expressive
purposes (§9.3), e.g. gan@-d@ka ga:n (night+lk-only night) ‘only night after night (and never in
daytime)’. This suﬃx occurs on the indicative positive form of the verb root, with the meaning
of ‘do just this’, e.g. waji-d@ka (laugh-only) ‘(he is) just laughing’ (§12.8.1).
   It can also occur on a nominal component of a complex verb, especially if its verbal compo-
nent is clear from the context, e.g. sa:-d@ka (sleep+lk-only) ‘(we will) only (do) sleeping’.
2. The suﬃx -r@ b ‘fully, totally’ occurs on uninﬂected forms of nouns and verbs and is not
compatible with any other inﬂections. A noun marked with -r@ b can occur in any function
except A. In 9.27, it occurs on a noun in an oblique function; in 9.28 it appears on a pronoun
(‘right there’).
9.27 ñ@d-@-ñ@d-@-r@b             adi:d
     middle-lk-middle-lk-fully go.down.impv
     ‘Go down right in the middle (of a ladder)’
  The suﬃx -r@ b is used in lieu of a superlative, e.g. kwasa-r@ b in 9.28. An elder sister is
teaching her younger sister how to shoot birds, and she is telling her to hit the really small
one.
9.28 ata [k@                    kwasa-r@b]NP           a-r@b                      avi
     then dem.prox+fem.sg small+fem.sg-fully dem.dist+fem.sg-fully impv+hit
     ‘(Can I hit it, said (the younger sister), no! (said the elder sister), that is a big one), you
     hit this the smallest one (or: a really small one), right there’
Along similar lines, n@ma kudi-r@ b (big+fem.sg language/voice-fully) means ‘in a really loud
voice’. A headless adjective n@ma-r@ b (big+fem.sg-fully) ‘really big one’ was used to refer to
a very big teacup.
   This same suﬃx is also used to express full identity with another entity. Yuamali’s reaction
to a list of cognates between Manambu and Gala was ñan-a kudi-r@b (we-lk language-fully)
‘(this is) our language fully!’ Similarly, Kulanawi said to me that his son’s name was Michael,
and added 9.29. A similar example is in 9.31.
9.29 ñ@n-a-d@                ñan sa:-r@b
     you.fem-lk-masc.sg child name+lk-fully
     ‘It is exactly like your son’s name’
  Just like -d@ka, -r@b attaches only to the indicative positive stem of a verb (see §12.8.1).
  With personal pronouns, -r@ b may be used somewhat idiomatically to refer to a person’s
wishes. This is the only instance where a form with -r@ b takes nominal cross-referencing in a
190      9 Derivation and Compoundingnon-verbal clause, as in ñ@n-a-r@b-a (you.fem-lk-fully-3fem.sgnom) ‘it is up to you (lit. it is
fully you)’.
3. The suﬃxes -aba:b, -a:b ‘also’ are used with members of any word class, and can attach to
an inﬂected noun or a verb. There are no restrictions on the syntactic function of a noun. In
9.30, -aba:b goes onto the inﬂected verb in the form of predicate focus. That is, -aba:b can have
a whole clause in its scope:9.30 kar-da-k@-m@na:l-aba:b
     carry-down-fut-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt+3fem.sgnom-too
     ‘It is the case that you took her down, too’   Within a clause, -aba:b and -a:b more often attach to a constituent than to the inﬂected verb.
The diﬀerence between the two suﬃxes is subtle: -a:b is preferred when numerous additional
possibilities are enumerated, that is, when there is more than one additional participant in the
clause. In contrast, -aba:b tends to be used when there is just one additional participant. In
9.31 -a:b (underlined) occurs with enumerated body parts, and -aba:b (bold and underlined)
adds one extra body part (line 3) or participant (line 5):9.31 [a-b@r        l@-k@-b@r       ñ@di      abakapi m@la:b         ma: t@]          [abakapi

     ‘Her two children did not have hawk’s eyes either, they did not have hawk’s nose either,
     they did not have hawk’s feathers either. This, too, the beak, too, is fully like a chicken’s
     beak, both (for) boy and (for) girl; their beards too are fully like chicken’s beards. She,
     too, got the head like (that) of a chicken.’   This example also shows that the linker -k@- can occasionally be omitted (as in l@-aba:b in
the third line). These are the only suﬃxes with long vowels. Given that they do not trigger vowel
shortening in nouns with a long vowel as would be expected for suﬃxes, such as ta:m ‘nose’,
it is possible that these are better treated as clitics (note that they do not acquire secondary
stress).
   The suﬃx -aba:b ‘also’ is probably etymologically related to the quantiﬁer aba:b ‘all’ (see
4.63 and §10.5).
4. The suﬃx -p@k has somewhat diﬀerent meanings depending on the class of word it attaches
to. As shown in Table 4.2 (§4.3.2), it means ‘like’ when used with verbs, ‘more or less; like’ when
used with nouns and other nominals, and is a comparative marker when used with adjectives.
The standard of comparison is not stated; a comparison is implied, as in 4.51 and 9.32
(a continuation of 9.28):

   One grammatical word can contain only one suﬃx of the four suﬃxes contrasted in Table 9.2;
but in a noun phrase, one suﬃx can go onto its head and another one can attach to its end, as
in 9.34. The suﬃx -p@k typically attaches to the end of an NP, or a clause, as we will see below.
9.34 t@b-@-d@ka kudi-p@k                 wa-kwa-na
     sky-lk-only language/voice-like say-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It (earthquake) sounds just like the language/voice of thunder’
With the connective atan ‘then’, -p@k means ‘like this, this is how’ (§10.2.2). With a numeral,
-p@k means ‘more or less, approximately’, as in 9.35:
9.35 akwur      l@-k@-k     vitiya-p@k
     impv+get she-obl-dat two+lk-approx
     ‘Give her two (Malay apples) or so’
  A noun or a pronoun accompanied by -p@k can occur in the predicate slot and take personal
cross-referencing, as in 9.36.
9.36 wun aw m@n-a-p@k-awun-@k
     I    then you.masc-lk-like-1fem.sgbas.vt-conf
     ‘Then I am like you’
   A noun with the suﬃx -p@k can take further case suﬃxes, e.g. Malu-p@ka:r yi-di (Malu-
like+lk+all go-3plbas.vt) ‘they went a distance like (the one) from here to the Malu village’.
   When used with a verb, the suﬃx -p@k implies comparison of activity. It then has a whole
clause in its scope—see 14.117, §19.3, and examples there. The suﬃx -p@k does not qualify
as a case marker: it can occur with cases and also, unlike any case-marked forms, a form
marked with -p@k can head a predicate. Unlike other derivational suﬃxes described here, it
is polyfunctional, being used as a derivational suﬃx ‘like’, as a means of clause combining,
and as a comparative marker on adjectives.
   Further non-word class-changing derivations include reduplication of nouns. Full reduplica-
tion of nouns has distributive meaning (also see §4.3, and Table 4.2), as in ña-ñ@ (day+lk-day)
‘every day, day in day out’, bap-a-bap (moon-lk-moon) ‘month after month’, t@p-a-t@p ‘every
village’, gwalugw@ gwalugw@ ma:j (clan+lk clan+lk story) ‘story which goes from one clan to
another’, tamiy-a-tamiy (area-lk-area) ‘every area, every place’, wi(y)-a-wi (house-lk-house)
192      9 Derivation and Compounding‘every house’, and n@b-a-n@b ‘various strangers’. Such nouns can be used in any function, and
take case markers.
   The reduplicated form of ga:n ‘night’ is irregular: ganap-ganap ‘every night’. The time noun
ganbab ‘early in the morning’ undergoes repetition rather than reduplication, in order to
acquire a distributive meaning, as in ganbab ganbab ‘every early morning’. The noun gra:b
is repeated in the locative case form: grab@m grab@m ‘every afternoon’. Time nouns denoting
relative time (tomorrow, yesterday, etc.) cannot be reduplicated.
   The noun s@ ‘name’ has an irregular reduplication pattern: say-si ‘(call) each (person or
house) by name’. This pattern is reminiscent of that discussed in §12.8 (also see §16.1, on k@tay-
k@ti ‘look around and around’). In both k@tay k@tí and say-si, reduplication involves repeating
all the syllables of the form after its main occurrence, with the vowel of the last syllable lost
and y changed to i .
   If a noun has a unique referent, it acquires an intensive meaning when reduplicated, as does
ñ@d ‘middle’ in ñ@d-@-ñ@d ‘the very middle’ (see 9.27 and 7.34). As shown in §4.3.2, reduplicated
adjectives also have intensive meaning, e.g. kwam ‘crazy’, kwam-a-kwam ‘very crazy’; yara
‘ﬁne’, yara-yara ‘very good’.
   The reduplication of closed word classes produces intensive or distributive meaning, e.g.
adverbs m@ya-m@ya:b ‘really really; indeed’; s@ms@ma:b ‘well and truly (not) at all’ (s@ma:b
‘not at all’: see §14.6); k@p ‘just’, k@p-a-k@p-a ma:j (just-lk-just-lk talk) ‘words for nothing,
useless talk’. When the number ‘one’ is reduplicated, its meaning is idiosyncratic: nak-a-nak
(one-lk-one) ‘not many; each individually’ (also see §10.6.1; cf. Iatmul kita ‘that one’, kita kita
‘one each; each per unit’: Gerd Jendraschek, p.c.). The indeﬁnite determiner ka:p ‘on its own;
alone’ can be reduplicated in the intensive meaning ‘all alone’ (kap@-ka:p).
   Inherently reduplicated roots are found in every word class except for verbs, e.g. ñauñau (t@)
‘smash’, l@kil@ki ‘soft’, n@mn@m ‘tired’, m@km@k, karkar ‘quietly’ (noun-like complements);
adverbs r @ka:r@k ‘properly’, apar apar ‘not properly’, mad@k mad@k ‘especially, namely’, and
r @ka:r@k ‘properly’; and quantiﬁers samasa:m ‘a lot’, and aba:b ‘all’.
   Among one-oﬀ derivational formatives is the formative -b which derives the lexeme gan@b
‘morning’ from ga:n ‘night’, and -ab which derives the time noun ganba:b ‘early in the morning’
from gan@b ‘morning’. (This noun undergoes repetition rather than reduplication, to acquire a
distributive meaning, as in ganbab ganbab ‘every early morning’.) The formative -b may well be
cognate with the terminative case -Vb which is used as a derivational device on adverbs (§4.4).
                                    9.3 comp oundingManambu has a number of patterns of nominal compounding. Some noun phrases can be
realized as one or more than one phonological word depending on their syllable length. They
diﬀer from compounds in the number of grammatical words they form, and their semantic
compositionality. A compound always forms one grammatical word and tends to be seman-
tically non-compositional. We saw in §2.5, that a modiﬁer-head noun phrase or a possessive
noun phrase (types A and C in §8.1.1) consisting of two or three syllables is pronounced as one
phonological word. Examples are: kula-má:j (new-word) ‘new word’, kwasa-ñán ‘small child’,
yala-wí (belly+lk-house) ‘the inside of a house’, m@w-mí ‘base of a tree’, taba-yí (hand+lk-ﬁre)
‘wrist watch’. They can be pronounced as two phonological words in slow deliberate register.
Similar structures are pronounced as several phonological words if more than three syllables
long.
                                                                      9.3 Compounding         193  Possessive noun phrases and adjective-noun noun phrases which start their life as phono-
logical compounds become true morphological compounds once (i) their meaning becomes
non-compositional (that is, the meaning of the whole is no longer a simple combination of
the meanings of the parts), and (ii) they form one grammatical word. This is the case with
possessive NPs of type A: these include personal names, e.g. Ñ@d-@-wi (middle-lk-house)
‘middle of the house’, and of type C, e.g. ab-a-wapwi (head-lk-dress) ‘hat’ and ap-a-t@p (bone-
lk-village) ‘Avatip’. These are discussed under types (1) and (2) below.
  In terms of morphological relationship between components and their word class, com-
pounds are of the following types:
1. ‘Genitive’ compounds consist of two nouns, one in a genitive, possessive, or associative
relationship to the other. Structurally, these correspond to possessive constructions of types A
and C in §8.1.1. The meaning is non-compositional to a varying extent. Examples include m@w-
t@p (base-village) ‘main village; an alternative name for Avatip’, ap-a-na:gw (bone/remainder-
lk sago) ‘sago ﬁbre left over from washing sago; sago pith’; nagw@-gar (sago+lk-ﬁeld) ‘ﬁeld
or grove of sago; where sago palms are’; t@p-a-kudi (village-lk-language) ‘village language,
Manambu’, n@b-@-du (dry.land-lk-man) ‘people of the jungle, strangers (a general term for
those who do not traditionally live on the Sepik River and are thus potential enemies: see
Harrison 1993 for a discussion of this notion)’. Place names are often compounds of this kind,
e.g. Yawa-bak (tree.species+lk-ﬁeld) ‘ﬁeld of tree.species’.
   Ad hoc expressions, like n@b@l-a-ga:n (today-lk-night) ‘tonight, the night of today’, nagw@-
ya:b (sago+lk-road) ‘road to sago or with sago’, or m@gw@-ñan (whatever+lk-child) ‘child to
do with whatever we were talking about previously’, straddle the boundary between NPs and
compounds and are inherently ambiguous, given the immense productivity of N-N structures
described in §8.1.1.
   Fixed collocations can be problematic as to whether they are compounds or noun phrases.
Examples like t@p-a-ja:p (village-lk-thing) ‘village thing, to refer to sorcery’; gu-jab@r (water-
ship) ‘water-raft’; t@n@b-@-baw (ﬁreplace-lk-ash) ‘ashes from a ﬁreplace’; and yar@g-a-du
(household-lk-man) ‘man of (the same) household’ can each be described as referring to a
unitary culturally signiﬁcant concept, and hence better treated as compounds. The latter two
instances are more than three syllables long and are often pronounced either with a secondary
stress, or as two phonological words.
   A particular N-N combination can be fully semantically transparent and be on the way
towards developing into a term. For instance, t@k-@-mi (seed-lk-tree) ‘fruit or seed of a tree’ is
the preferred way of referring to any kind of pill. Similarly, t@p-a-s@ (village-lk-name) ‘village
name’ is a term for traditional name, and wali-s@ (white.person-name) means ‘Christian or
given name’ (referring to name given at baptism and diﬀerent from the traditional, or ‘village’,
name and not just ‘name of/for a white person’).
   A component of a compound can develop a special meaning limited to just this context:
ap-a- (bone-lk) has the meaning of ‘main, true’, as in the name of apa-t@p, that is, Avatip, the
main village; and other expressions, such as ap-a-nagudaw (bone-lk-Nagudaw) ‘a true member
of Nagudaw clan’.
2. Adjective-noun compounds are fairly productive, e.g. kula-t@p (new-village) ‘new village;
term referring to the new location of Avatip and the villages which are relatively recent
compared to Avatip’; r@k-a-s@p (dry-lk-skin) ‘dry skin; a person with dry skin; term referring
to any old person’. Just as with type 1 compounds, some are ambiguous with noun phrases,
e.g. kula-kamna:gw (new/fresh-food) ‘fresh food’ as opposed to dry food.
194     9 Derivation and Compounding   Adjective-noun compounds often contain m@ya- ‘real’ whose exact meaning depends on the
second component of a compound: m@y-a-m@y-a-kayik (real-lk-real-lk-image/ghost) means
‘carving; picture (or any man-made image of a human or animal)’; m@y-a-na:gw (real-lk-
sago) refers to cultivated sago; m@y-a-kamna:gw (real-lk-food) refers to protein foods and
also traditional foods considered ‘strong’, such as sago (see §21.2.4).
   The noun wali used as a modiﬁer frequently occurs in compounds to refer to white peo-
ple’s imports, e.g. wali-kamna:gw (white.person-food) ‘non-traditional food stuﬀ’, wali-yaki
(white.person-smoke) ‘store-bought tobacco’, wali-na:gw (white.person-sago) ‘biscuit’, wali-s@
‘Christian name’ (see above). This term is often extended to refer to any object acquired after
contact, e.g. wali-kami: (white.person-ﬁsh), to refer to a type of ﬁsh reportedly from Indonesian
waters which has been invading the waters of the Sepik for the last twenty-ﬁve years. Some of
these compounds develop very speciﬁc meanings, e.g. wali-kudi (white.person/east-language)
used to refer to any ‘white man’s language’, that is, both Tok Pisin and English, but now
mostly used to refer to Tok Pisin (Inglis kudi being the term for English). The compound
wali-n@b (white.person-dry.land) ‘dry-land-dweller of white person type; white person’ is a way
of referring to white people. (This has a morpheme-per-morpheme cognate in Iatmul (Gerd
Jendraschek, p.c.), and could have been calqued from Iatmul.)
   The status of a compound as type 1 or type 2 may be indeterminate if the ﬁrst component
can be used as either a noun or an adjective. This is the case with compounds containing wali
‘white person; something to do with white person; eastern (wind); something coming from the
east’, and a few others, e.g. kaykwap-a ta:b (lazy-lk hand) ‘left hand’, literally, ‘lazy-hand or
hand of a lazy one’.
3. Coordinate compounds consist of two nouns typically without the linker referring to a
new referent which can be deﬁned by the two conjoined referents as its major representa-
tives, e.g. du-ta:kw (man-woman) ‘people’, mæn-ta:b (leg-hand) ‘arms and legs’, amæy-asa:y
(mother-father) ‘parents’, væy-ka:d (spear-shield) ‘arms’. If the ﬁrst component contains a
long vowel, it gets shortened, e.g. awa:y ‘mother’s brother’, away-mamæy (lit ‘maternal.uncle-
mother.and.her.sisters’) ‘relatives responsible for bringing up a child’. The ﬁrst component of
some coordinate compounds can take the comitative marker, e.g. am-a-wa n@bi (bow-lk-com
arrow) (as in 7.71) or am-n@bi ‘bow and arrow’. Possibly, du-ta:kw (man-woman) ‘people’,
mæn-ta:b (leg-hand) ‘arms and legs’ were inﬂuenced by Tok Pisin man-meri ‘people’ and lek-
han ‘arms and legs’. (However, compounds of similar structure have been attested both in
related Ndu languages and in the neighbouring Kwoma and Yessan-Mayo.) The compound
kami-kamna:gw (ﬁsh-food) ‘foodstuﬀ’ has a generic noun as its second component.
4. Synonymous compounds are structurally and semantically similar to coordinate com-
pounds. They consist of two near-synonyms, or nouns from the same semantic ﬁeld, both
with non-human referents. The compound describes either a group of linked referents, or
one referent with pronounced features of both components. The linker is obligatory, e.g.
kamkaw-a-ñan (hairy.yam-lk-smooth.white.yam) ‘yams as a group’; ar-a-ñab (lake-lk-river)
‘lake’; apwi-m@d (cassowary.vocative.term-cassowary) ‘mature female cassowary’; d@g-a-ta:m
(beak-lk-nose) ‘nose’.
5. Generic-specific compounds are somewhat similar to constructions with noun classiﬁers
in Australian and in Mayan languages. They consist of a noun ‘woman’ or ‘man’ followed
by a speciﬁc noun. With hybrid nouns, they serve to disambiguate the sex of a referent (see
§5.3), as in takwa-ñan (woman+lk-child) ‘girl’, du-a-ñan (man-lk-child) ‘boy’, gwa:s ‘turtle’,
du-a gwa:s ‘male turtle’, takwa gwa:s ‘female turtle’. They can also combine with some speciﬁc
                                                                                      9.3 Compounding               195nouns whose referents are inanimate, or non-human; then they indicate species, as in du-a-mæj
(man-lk-thread) ‘strong natural ﬁbre for making stringbags’ and du-a-kabay (man-lk-snake)
‘type of dangerous snake’. The term du-a-ma:gw (man-lk-generic.noun) ‘brother’ also belongs
to this type. These are similar to gender-identifying compounds containing nouns ‘man’
and ‘woman’ as their second component, as in babay-du ‘maternal grandfather’, babay-ta:kw
‘maternal grandmother’, yanan-ta:kw ‘daughter’s daughter’, yanan-du ‘daughter’s son’, and
bap-a-ta:kw (moon-lk-woman) ‘lady moon’ (note that moon is always feminine: see §5.2.1).
6. Order and size compounds contain asa:y ‘father’ and amæy ‘mother’ as their ﬁrst compo-
nent. The term ‘father’ denotes large size, as in numa-d@ asa:y wuk (big-masc.sg father tooth)
‘very big tooth’, or asa:y wuk ‘huge tooth’, numa-d@ asa:y na:b ‘very long hair’ and so on (also
see §5.2.1 and 5.14). The term amæy refers to order in the compound amæy ta:kw (mother wife)
‘ﬁrst wife’, and perhaps also to prominence, as in amæy ta:b (mother hand) ‘thumb’. There is
no linker between the components.
7. Echo compounds involve nouns with non-human referents, and have the meaning of ‘things
of the same nature as the component which serves as base of echo alliteration’ (cf. Yip 1998:
237–8, for an outline of this phenomenon), e.g. ar-sar (lake-echo.reduplication) ‘lake and so
on; lake and waterways’; mij-ma:j (echo.reduplication-talk) ‘all kinds of small talk’. Echo
compounds of adverbs and one adjective have intensive meaning, e.g. kuprap ‘bad’, kuprap@-
saprap ‘really bad’, walba:b ‘near, close’, walba:b kalba:b ‘very close’ (or wal@b ‘close’, wal@b
kal@b ‘very close’), and sakw@r ‘happy’, makw@r sakw@r ‘very happy’, and so do noun-like
complements, such as wayg@r (with auxiliary) ‘complain’, wayg@r sayg@r ‘complain a lot’;
kayg@n ‘(be) silent’, kayg@n sayg@n ‘be really silent’. The only example of an inherently echo
compound is the noun-like complement saul@y paul@y ‘be in great numbers’, as in 9.37:
9.37 du-ta:kw      saul@y.paul@y      yi-di
     man-woman in.great.numbers go-3plbas.vt
     ‘People were in great numbers’. 18. Compounds involving closed word classes include a Postposition-Noun combination
kuk@-m@l (at.back-eye) ‘(look) sideways’, and a Numeral-Noun combination viti-kisa-ñ@di
(two-?-child:du) ‘twins’.
9. Verb-noun compounds consist of a verb root plus a noun. The structure of the compounds
is similar to that of relative clauses (see §§19.2.2–3): the noun can be S, O, oblique, or A (the
latter is not so frequent), r @-tami: (sit-area) ‘area where one lives; living area’, kiya-du (die-man)
‘dead man’, bra-t@p (scrape-coconut) ‘coconut for scraping’, bla-ma:j (speak-speech) ‘talk’. A
compound can consist of a subject of a weather verb + the weather verb’s root + noun root, as
in [wa:l ja]-s@k@r (rain fall-time) ‘time of rainfall’.
   This compounding type is extremely productive and is widely used to coin terms, such as
kusu-ja:p (wear-thing) ‘clothing’, gra-kudi (cry-language) ‘mourning, crying; term for mourn-
ing songs’, kiya-du ‘dead man; used as name of a Manambu football team in Avatip’. The term
s@kwa-mawul (carve-state.of.mind/inside) ‘state of mind of a carver’ was suggested by David
Takendu as a term meaning ‘patience’. The ﬁrst component of such compounds can consist of
  1 Echo compounds are attested in other Ndu languages; the examples given by Wendel (1993: 92) from Hanga
Kundi (Wosera), involve verbs, unlike Manambu where verbs do not follow this pattern. Similar examples are given by
Staalsen and Staalsen (1975) in their dictionary of Iatmul, e.g. walanga salanga ‘relatives’. Gerd Jendraschek discovered
further echo compounds, e.g. wapuk sapuk ‘stories’ (pronounced as wapuchapuk). The number of echo compounds in
Manambu is too restricted to warrant any meaningful generalizations.
196     9 Derivation and Compoundinga complex verb in its root form and a noun, as in s@-kwa-ja:p (sleep-hab-thing) ‘sleeping gear’,
s@-kwa-wi (sleep-hab-house) ‘house for sleeping’.
   In just one instance, the verb root in a Verb-Noun compound appears with a formative
unique to this compound: bla-ja-ya-ma:j (speak-?-come?-talk/story) ‘story; something to tell’
(see §15.3). This compound is not functionally equivalent to a relative clause.
A morphological type of a compound is hard to determine if part of it is not used anywhere else.
Examples include saw-na:gw (?-sago) ‘wild sago’, s@p-a-tabi (body-lk-?) ‘clothes; body cover’,
as@-kami: (?-ﬁsh) ‘catﬁsh’, and ñ@g-a-ñam (leaf-lk-?) ‘leafy vegetable’. Sometimes a part of a
compound is no longer used in Manambu itself, and comparison with related languages may
provide a clue. This is the case with gab-@-ma:j (?-lk-story) ‘traditional story; teacher’, often
pronounced as gama:j. The ﬁrst component is cognate to Iatmul gabu- ‘talk, discuss’ (Staalsen
n.d.b; Jendraschek, p.c.); that is, originally this form must have been a type 9 compound.
Along similar lines, the term gai-na:gw (?-sago) ‘sago starch’ probably contains the element gai
cognate to the term for ‘house, household’ throughout the Ndu family. Terms gai-du (Gai-man)
and gai-ta:kw (Gai-woman) are used to refer to the Wosera, and especially the Abelam in whose
language gai is a term for ‘house, village’.
   The modiﬁer nawi ‘mate, one of the same kind, peer group’, as in nawi-du (mate-man) ‘man
of the same age; mate’ and nawi-ta:kw ‘woman of the same age, peer group’, never occurs on
its own; as a result, the structural type of compound is diﬃcult to determine. Unlike other
components of compounds, nawi can be reduplicated without reduplicating the noun. The
reduplication imparts collective meaning, as in nawi-nawi-du ‘all male peer group’, nawi-nawi-
ta:kw ‘all female peer group’. In combination with ‘child’, the reduplicated form nawi-nawi
requires the plural ñanugw ‘children’, as in nawi-nawi-ñanugw ‘all children peer group’. The
agreement on the verb is also plural:
9.38 [nawi-nawi-ta:kw] ata aban taka-di
     peer-peer-woman then pact put.down-3plbas.vt
     ‘All peer group women then conspired together’
  Compounds can have a complex internal structure. Attested combinations involve type 2
and type 9, e.g. gla-[kusu-wapwi] (black+lk-wear-clothes) ‘black clothes’ (for instance, as a
type of clothing worn under mourning); type 2 and type 5, as in [ñiki-s@p-]a-du (red-skin-lk-
man) ‘white man’; or type 2 and type 3, e.g. n@b-@-[du-ta:kw] (inland-lk-man-woman) ‘people
who live inland’ (a term used to refer to those who do not traditionally live on the Sepik River:
§1.4.1).
        10        Closed Classes
Closed word classes are personal pronouns (§10.1), demonstratives (§10.2), indeﬁnites (§10.3),
interrogatives (§10.4), quantiﬁers (§10.5), and numerals (§10.6). Most of them share some prop-
erties with nouns but do not take the full range of noun morphology discussed in Chapters 4–9.
This justiﬁes their recognition as separate classes. An overview of their morphological and
syntactic features is in §10.7.                               10.1 p e r s o na l p ro n o u n sPersonal pronouns are given in Table 3.3 (repeated here). They distinguish three numbers—
singular, dual, and plural—and two genders in second and in third person singular. There is a
clear etymological connection between independent pronouns, the two sets of tense-sensitive
verbal cross-referencing markers, and cross-referencing enclitics employed with non-verbal
predicates (listed in Tables 3.1–2 and 3.4). Grammaticalization of personal pronouns as cross-
referencing markers appears to be relatively recent.
   Personal pronouns share most properties with nouns. Just like nouns, they take the approx-
imative suﬃx -p@k in the meaning ‘like’, e.g. wun-a-p@k (I-lk-approx) ‘more or less like me’.
A pronoun can occur in apposition with a noun or a noun phrase, e.g. wun ñ@n-a ñam@s (I
you.fem-lk+fem.sg younger.sibling) ‘me, your younger sister’. However, it cannot be modiﬁed
by adjectives or relative clauses, or head a possessive NP (see type D2 in §8.1.1, for possessive
constructions employed with a pronominal possessor).
   All non-singular personal pronouns participate in argument elaboration (‘inclusory’) con-
structions (see §6.2.3; examples 6.32–3) as cover terms. A direct object expressed with a
personal pronoun tends to be case marked, unless the grammatical relations are fully clear
from the context (as in 7.5, in §7.2).
   Non-third person pronouns stand apart from third person pronouns in the following ways:
(i) First and second person pronouns always have an animate (preferably human) referent, as
a speech act participant. Third person pronouns may refer to any entity.
(ii) Third person non-plural pronouns take the oblique marker -k@- (see §4.1.1; this form is
homophonous with the possessive marker -k@- discussed in §8.2) to form cases expressed with
a non-ø suﬃx, e.g. d@-k@-k (he-obl-dat) ‘to him’, d@-k@-wa (he-obl-com) ‘with him’, and to
combine with each of four suﬃxes discussed in §9.2. The linker is also obligatory if a pronoun
is used as an argument of a postposition (see §4.5), e.g. d@-k@ kuk@r (he-obl after) ‘after him’.
(iii) Third person pronouns take all case markers, while ﬁrst and second person pronouns do
not occur with transportative cases.
(iv) First and second person pronouns occur in identiﬁcation constructions (see §8.2.2) whereby
the notional possessor is the subject of a verbless clause, and the possessed noun occupies the
predicate slot. Such constructions with personal pronouns imply full ownership and complete

names belonging to their clan, and then summarize his speech by saying 8.24 or 10.1:
10.1 ñan-adiyan
     we-1plnom
     ‘These are ours’ (lit. ‘(these) are us’)
(v) Only third person pronouns are used as pronominal possessive markers in possessive noun
phrases of type D2, used if possessor is a noun with a speciﬁc referent (§8.1.1).
(vi) Only a third person pronoun can be used as a modiﬁer in noun phrases which contain a
functionally unmarked distal demonstrative. The agreement in gender and number with the
head noun is obligatory. The meaning of these combinations is akin to that of a deﬁnite article
with emphatic overtones, ‘that very one’ (see §20.1.1 on NP structure). This is a way of referring
to a previously mentioned important participant. Example 10.2 comes from a story about a
man who encountered a woman in the jungle.10.2 [la                  ta:kw] vyak@t-a ta:kw ma:, kuprap-@ ta:kw-al
     she+dem.dist.fem.sg woman good-lk woman neg bad-lk woman-3fem.sgnom
     ‘That previously mentioned woman is not a good woman, she is a bad woman (she is an
     evil spirit)’
Three clauses later, the woman is mentioned again; she is an important participant—the one
who is going to bring misfortune to the man. A noun phrase which contains a personal
pronoun in an article-like function, a distal demonstrative, and an indeﬁnite pronoun is in
10.3:
10.3 [d@ a-d@               n@k@-d@       du] ata ya:d                 kwarba:r
     he dem.dist-masc.sg other-masc.sg man then go+3masc.sgbas bush+lk+all
     ‘That very one (previously mentioned important participant) other man then went to the
     bush’
  Such sequences of a personal pronoun and a demonstrative do not belong to two separate
NPs, because there is no pause between them, and the two are often pronounced as one
phonological word.
  These six features point towards the existence of subtle grammatical distinctions between
ﬁrst and second person pronouns (that is, speech act participants) and third person pronouns
(non-speech act participants). We return to this distinction in §19.5.4, on speech report tech-
niques.
                                                                 10.1 Personal Pronouns        199A fully reduplicated pronoun has an emphatic meaning roughly translatable as ‘oneself’, e.g.
ñ@n-a-ñ@n ‘you (feminine) yourself, really you, as for you’, wun-a-wun ‘I myself; really me, as for
me’. A fully reduplicated singular third person pronoun requires the oblique marker -k@-, as in
d@-k@-d@-k@ (he-obl-he-obl) ‘he himself’. As is typical for VkV syllables (process A3 in §2.6),
the middle syllable -k@- is elided in normal to fast speech, and one frequently hears d@-d@-k@
‘he himself’ (as in 10.10, 10.11, and 10.15). Interestingly, the oblique -k@- does not occur on
third person dual pronouns (10.4)—we can recall that the linker -k@- is obligatorily used with
any non-plural non-reduplicated third person pronoun.
   This emphatic meaning of full reduplication is a speciﬁc feature of pronouns as a word
class. An emphatic pronoun can occur in any function in a clause. In 10.4, it is used to mark
possessor, and in 10.5 it marks addressee.
10.4 b@r-br@-k@            ñan kayt@k wuna:k       kur-kwa-na-b@r
     3du-3du-obl+fem.sg child like        I+lk+dat do-hab-act.foc-3dubas.vt
     ‘They used to treat me like their own child’

     I-lk-I+lk+dat neg.hab speak/tell-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘He never talks to me myself’
In 10.15, it marks the A and the O. The two meanings of an emphatic reduplicated personal
pronoun—that of emphasis and that of ownership—may not be distinguishable, as in 10.6:
10.6 d@-k@-d@-ka                      ta:kw ma:
     he-lk-he-lk+dem.dist+fem.sg wife neg
     ‘He himself had no wife’ (lit. ‘His own wife did not (exist)’, or ‘As for him, there was no
     wife’)
  When a reduplicated pronoun appears in the predicate slot, it does not take any personal
cross-referencing. As shown in 10.7, it can take the conﬁrmation marker -@k:
10.7 wun-a-wun-@k k@ka                          r@-tua
     I-lk-I-conf      dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg sit-1sgsubj.p+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is me myself, I am here sitting’
Reduplicated personal pronouns translate into Tok Pisin with a particle yet (as in em yet ‘he
himself’, yu yet ‘you yourself’). Speakers who frequently code-switch into Tok Pisin employ
the particle yet (underlined), as in 10.8. This was corrected as 10.9, by another speaker:
10.8 ñ@n yet væn        r@-ñ@n-@k
     you yet see+seq sit-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
     ‘You yourself are sitting looking’
10.9 ñ@n-a-ñ                væn      r@-ñ@n-@k
     you.fem-lk-you.fem see+seq sit-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
     ‘You yourself are sitting looking’
  Some speakers from Malu village employ both a reduplicated personal pronoun and the Tok
Pisin particle yet:
10.10 d@d@-k@            yet m@y-a-m@y-a ap-a-nagudaw-ad
      he(+lk)+he-obl yet real-lk-real-lk bone-lk-nagudaw-3masc.sgnom
      ‘He himself is a very true member of real Nagudaw clan’
200     10 Closed ClassesThis phenomenon whereby native and borrowed grammatical forms appear together is known
as lexical/grammatical parallelism (see Hajek 2006 for Tetun Dili; Aikhenvald forthcoming c).
This is how foreign forms make their way into the language, in a situation which appears to
disfavour a downright replacement of native forms with foreign insertions.
  The semantic analogy between the reduplicated personal pronouns must have contributed to
an extension of reduplicated pronouns to mark reﬂexive, as in 10.11 which describes a suicide.
Such examples are rare.
10.11 d@d@-k@          vya-s@pa-ku         ada
      he(+lk)+he-obl hit-hit.body-compl.ss dem.dist.react.top.masc.sg
      kiya:d
      die+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Having hit himself, he died’
  An alternative to emphatic personal pronouns as markers of co-referential possession is the
adverb ka:p ‘own’, as in kapa kagr@s (own+lknephew) ‘one’s own nephew’. Further ways of
expressing reﬂexive meanings are discussed in §16.2.4.                                  10.2 de m o n s t rat i v e sManambu has three demonstrative roots, k@- ‘proximate demonstrative: near speaker’, wa-
‘proximate demonstrative: near addressee’, and a- ‘distal demonstrative (far from both)’. These
roots occur in nominal demonstratives also used as spatio-temporal demonstratives (§10.2.1),
in manner adverbial demonstratives (§10.2.2), and in reactivated topic demonstratives (§10.2.3).
Of all demonstratives, only nominal demonstratives distinguish additional distance (as shown
in Table 10.1 below) and directions.","[211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227]"

        4.2.2 Semantically and grammatically determined subclasses of verbsVerbs fall into several transitivity classes—see A below. Polyfunctional verbs are a special
subclass—see B. The verb ‘give’ forms a class on its own—see C. A small class of weather
verbs is discussed under D, and complex verbs consisting of a verbal root and a non-verbal
component are under E.
  A few other verbs display unusual grammatical and semantic features. These include
ingestive verbs k@- ‘consume (eat, drink, smoke)’ and j @- ‘chew’; verbs of speech; generic
verbs; and verbs of perception. These are discussed in §§21.1–3. Verbs can be classiﬁed
with respect to how they combine with directional markers—see §16.1.1. Further, minor
                                                                                    4.2 Verbs       79properties of various semantic subclasses of verbs will be discussed throughout the grammar as
appropriate.
A. In terms of Transitivity Classes, Manambu has strictly intransitive, transitive, and ditran-
sitive verbs. Strictly intransitive verbs include motion verbs, e.g. yi- ‘go’, ya- ‘come’, g@ p- ‘run’,
tabu- ‘escape’, posture verbs, e.g. kwa- ‘stay’, r @- ‘sit’, and a few others, such as gra- ‘cry’,
warsam(a)- ‘be angry’, and kawi- ‘come ashore’.
   Over 80 per cent of verbs are S=A ambitransitives, e.g. laku- ‘know, understand’, used
intransitively in 3.1 and transitively in 3.2; other such verbs include k@- ‘consume (food, drink,
smoke)’, j @- ‘chew’, and wuk@- ‘hear, understand’. A few verbs can be used only transitively,
e.g. yi- ‘say, speak’ and kur- ‘do, make, get’.
   As shown in §3.1, an O can be either unmarked for case, or marked with the accusative-
locative -(V)m. The direct object of verbs with somewhat negative overtones takes the dative
marking. This agrees with one of the meanings of the dative case as a ‘maleﬁciary’ marker
(§7.4). For instance, the S=A ambitransitive verb yaga- ‘be scared’ takes the O in dative case,
e.g. kaykak yaga-na (ghost+dat be.scared-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she is scared of a ghost’.
In its meaning ‘be worried about someone’, the polysemous verb wuk@- ‘hear, obey, feel, worry’
takes the object in dative, as in 4.11 and 21.19.
4.11 d@-k@-k           wuk@-na-wun
     3masc.sg-obl-dat worry-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am worried about him’
The verb ‘see’ is unusual in the case marking for its O constituent. It is unmarked if the object
seen is indeﬁnite or not completely seen. If the verb has an atelic meaning, ‘see’ (by chance),
the object is in the dative case, as in the ﬁrst line of 4.12. And it is marked with the accusative-
locative if the object is fully seen and the action is telic, rather than atelic—that is, if the verb
v@- means ‘look’, as in the second line of 4.12. (The accusative-locative case marks the object
of this verb in its newly acquired meaning ‘read’: see §21.1.2.)
4.12 [br@-k@-k      v@-tu@-k]          [wun-a:m       v@-ku]         [ata wa-b@r]
     3du-obl-dat see-1sg-compl.ds I-lk+acc/loc see-compl.ss thus say-3dubas.p
     ‘After I’d seen the two of them, having looked on and on (lit. going) at me, they said thus’
   Strictly transitive and ambitransitive verbs diﬀer from intransitive verbs in their derivational
possibilities. Intransitive verbs can form causative compounds with the verb taka- ‘put’ as V2
(see §15.3.1 on its applicative-like meaning). The preﬁx kay- (limited in productivity) derives a
strictly transitive verb from an intransitive verb, e.g. wiy- ‘be broken’, kay-wiy- ‘break by hand,
e.g. nuts’. If used with an ambitransitive verb, kay- has a diﬀerent eﬀect—for instance, it may
imply a special eﬀort or an unusually large object, e.g. tapu- ‘hold, carry’, kay-tapu- ‘hold, carry
(an unusually large bundle)’ (see §16.2). Most verbs derived with the preﬁx kay-, or causatives
with wa- ‘say’ as V1 are strictly transitive, e.g. kay-napwi- ‘unwrap (e.g. a parcel)’, kay-puti-
‘take oﬀ’ (see §15.3.2 and §16.2.1 for further discussion).
   Verbs of speech, perception, and giving, and most intransitive verbs (e.g. ‘die’ or ‘stand up’),
diﬀer from other verbs in terms of (a) whether they combine with directional markers at all,
and (b) what the semantic eﬀects are—see §16.1.
   Verbs which are both S=A and S=O ambitransitives include all the generic verbs (§§21.1–3),
t@ p- ‘close’, kaykwa- ‘spill something intentionally (transitive); capsize (intransitive)’, wuka-
‘drop or spill unintentionally; fall’, wula- ‘enter; make enter’, s@luku- ‘forget something; be
forgotten’, gwaj- ‘turn (the handle); turn (by itself)’, rali- ‘untie something; untie (by itself)’,
kus@- ‘ﬁnish’ (4.13–14).
80      4 Word Classes4.13 [wun-a        gabu-ma:j]       bu      kus@-na

     dem.dist.react.top.masc.sg ﬁnish-1dusubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘We have ﬁnished it (a long story)’The verb kus@- is used intransitively as a euphemism in lieu of ‘die’, with a human subject.
   An ambitransitive verb may have somewhat diﬀerent meanings when used transitively and
when used intransitively: transitive kaja- means ‘open by moving apart (legs, book), move (e.g.
ﬁngers)’; the same verb used intransitively means ‘disperse’. The transitive verb wapa- means
‘leave, abandon’; the same verb used intransitively means ‘be full, not want any more’, as in
ya:l wapa-na (belly leave/be.full-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘he was full’.
   The class of S=O ambitransitives appears to be expanding. Transitive verbs such as kasapwi-
‘open ‘ and yi-pa:kw- ‘hide’ are used intransitively by innovative speakers, much to the annoy-
ance of the traditionalists. A form yi-pa:kw@-d (go-hide-3masc.sgbas.p) normally means ‘he
hid (something)’; whereas for innovative speakers it can also mean ‘he became hidden’. An
intransitive verb can occasionally be used transitively: kiya- ‘die’ was used to mean ‘kill’ in an
angry outcry at a misbehaving child:4.15 ka-l                              kiya-kiya-k@-tua-ñ@n-@k
     dem.prox+fem.sg-3fem.sgnom die-die-fut-1sgsubj.vt-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
     ‘This one! I will well and truly kill you!’   Extended intransitives form a small subclass of intransitive verbs. These have an obligatory
second argument which is unmarked for case and cannot be cross-referenced on the verb. One
such verb, patiaku- ‘turn into (something)’, was illustrated in 3.10. The second argument can
be obligatory; for instance, yaku- ‘wash’ is typically used with the unmarked instrumental
argument gu ‘water’, as in gu yaku-na-wun (water wash-act.foc-1sgbas.vt) ‘I wash, bathe’ (lit.
‘I wash (with water)’). Or it can be optional, as is the case with wapruku- ‘be overﬂowing’:
this verb can be used intransitively, as in ya:l bu wapruku-na (belly already be.overﬂowing-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘(I am) very full, lit. belly is already overﬂowing’; or with an unmarked
instrument, as in 3.11 (‘overﬂowing with money’).
   Ditransitive verbs are a small class which includes wa- ‘say, tell’, s@maka- ‘show’, yapi- ‘buy,
sell, pay’, kalipa- ‘learn, teach’, and a loan verb sali- ‘send’ (from Tok Pisin salim ‘send’), the
third argument being recipient. The verb taka- ‘put’ has a location as a third argument. All of
these except ‘show’ and ‘put’ can be used as transitives and as A=S ambitransitives. The verb
wa- ‘say’ has the speech content (as object) and the recipient as its arguments. It can be used
transitively, with just the recipient as the second argument. If the speech content is a direct
speech report, it cannot be cross-referenced. Direct speech report constructions are discussed
in §19.5. The verb ‘give’ is a class of its own, both in terms of form and of semantics. See C
below.
   Transitivity of verbs is neutralized in what look like complex sentences consisting of a verb
in the completive, cotemporaneous, or manner sequencing form and one of the three polyfunc-
tional verbs (t@- ‘stand’, r @- ‘sit’, kwa- ‘stay’, also used as positional verbs); see §17.5. Pervasive
use of sequencing constructions with a copula where the verb’s transitivity is neutralized may
be one of the reasons why the class of S=O ambitransitives is currently expanding.
                                                                                   4.2 Verbs       81B. Polyfunctional Verbs: copula verbs, support verbs, and auxiliaries
Manambu has ten verbs which can each be used in two or three of the following functions—as
copula verbs, as support verbs, and also as auxiliaries. Five of them are also used as lexical
verbs. A summary of these verbs and their functions is in Table 4.1.
   When used as copula verbs, they head the predicate of copula clauses which involve two
arguments but cannot be considered either transitive or intransitive (see Dixon 2002b for
a typological overview of copulas, and §20.1.3). In Manambu, the relationship between the
two arguments of a copula clause—the copula subject and the copula complement—covers
identity, attribution, location, and possession. Their choice depends (a) on the meaning of the
copula construction, and (b) on the semantic type of copula complement. Further meanings
typically associated with copula clauses can also be expressed with verbless clauses or non-
verbal predicate heads—we return to this in §20.1.3.
   When these polyfunctional verbs occur as auxiliaries in complex predicates, they impart
an aspect or modality speciﬁcation to the whole construction, and take further tense, aspect,
mood, and modality inﬂections (see §§17.1–4).
   Some also occur as support verbs with uninﬂected verbs, carrying tense, aspect, mood,
and modality inﬂections. Such uninﬂected verbs include completive, completive-intensive, and
customary aspects, desiderative and frustrative modality, and a few other categories detailed in
Table 11.1. Loan verbs typically require a support verb, e.g. stati t@- (start support.verb) ‘start’.
Support verbs are similar to the so-called ‘light verbs’ (see a deﬁnition in Matthews 1997), used
to construct verbal expressions with accompanying nouns or with borrowed verbal roots (see
Haig 2001: 213 on similar use of ‘do’ in Kurmanjî and Zazaki, both Iranian). See §17.2 for
details. In addition, some polyfunctional verbs appear in lexicalized complex predicates—see
§17.3.
   Five of the polyfunctional verbs can also be used as independent lexical verbs. These are
positional verbs ‘stand’, ‘sit’, and ‘stay’, and the verbs kur- ‘do, take, get’ and yi- ‘say; go’.
These have a full range of grammatical forms including imperatives. The other ﬁve verbs do
not have a full range of grammatical forms—for instance, they cannot form imperatives.
   Each of the ten verbs featured in Table 4.1 can be considered polysemous and multifunc-
tional. The regularity of their multiple functions points towards the appropriateness of a
polysemy, rather than a homonymy, analysis. But can we decide which of the uses is primary?
We address this issue in §17.2.
   When these verbs are employed as copula verbs, their copula subject shares all syntactic and
morphological properties with subjects (A/S) of other sorts, including cross-referencing on the
verb and case marking. It behaves like an S in terms of its ability to control agreement with the
‘reactivated topic’ deictic marker (operating on an S/O basis)—see §3.3. Copula complements
are diﬀerent from any other argument in that they (i) never take any case marking and (ii)
are never cross-referenced on the verb (see §7.2). All copula clauses show the expected rela-
tional meanings—identity, attribution, and location. One copula (t@-) is also used to express
possession and ‘becoming’. See discussion below.
   The verbs na- ‘be (of physical states; natural phenomena)’, tay- ‘be (of climatic states)’, yasa-/
yas@- ‘be (of physical states, e.g. hunger, thirst)’, say- ‘be (of some states, e.g. shame)’, and yæy-
‘be (of smells)’ occur with a restricted set of formally unmarked nouns or nominals, and can be
interpreted in either of two ways. They may be viewed either as copula existential verbs with the
corresponding nouns and nominals in the copula complement (CC) slot, or as support verbs
for such nouns and nominals. We can recall, from §4.1.2, that many nominals can only occur
as CC of such verbs. The copulas na-, tay-, and yasa-/yas@- allow the option of having a zero

to these in §17.2.
   A nominal part of the predicate containing a support verb shares morphological and syn-
tactic properties with copula complements. Both are formally unmarked, cannot be negated or
questioned separately from the verb they precede, and have a ﬁxed position in a clause (they
can only be separated from it by the connective ata or the reactivated topic demonstratives).
   The major diﬀerence is semantic: when used as copula verbs, the multifunctional verbs listed
in Table 4.1 reﬂect one or more of the relational meanings typically associated with copula
clauses (see §20.1.3 and Dixon 2002b). When used as support verbs, they are eﬀectively mere
‘placeholders’ for the inﬂectional categories which cannot be expressed otherwise.
   The verbs listed under 6–10 can be seen as primarily support verbs with a strong semantic
and partially syntactic similarity to existential copulas. A broken line separating columns 2 and
3 for these verbs in Table 4.1 reﬂects this indeterminacy in their status.
   We will now discuss the polyfunctional verbs in Table 4.1 one by one.
1. The copula t@- in the meaning of ‘become’ was illustrated in 3.8–9. It is used as a support
verb with uninﬂected frustratives in 4.9–10. It can also be used as an existential verb as
illustrated in 4.16–17; then it occurs with either a locative, or a reactivated topic demonstrative.
4.16 al@k        apaw@l k@ta b@um          t@-na-di
     this.is.why spirit now haze+loc stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt
     ‘This is why spirits are now staying in a haze’ (and are invisible to us)
4.17 kayik        ada                              t@-na-d
     ghost/spirit dem.dist.react.top.masc.sg stand-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘The ghost is (there)!’ (said, in fear, by Tanina, then 8 years of age)
   The verb t@- can also be used in the meaning of ‘have’, as in 4.18. Its second argument is
similar to the copula complement in that it is not cross-referenced on the verb. If a reactivated
topic demonstrative occurs in such a construction, it agrees in gender and number with the
subject of t@- and not with the possessed entity. This indicates that the subject of t@- behaves
like an intransitive subject (S) no matter whether the verb is used with one argument, or with
two.
4.18 n@ma       kabak            adika                     t@-na-di
     big+fem.sg money(lit.stone) dem.dist.react.top+plural have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
     ‘Now they (mentioned again) have a lot of money’
  The verb t@- also occurs in idiomatic collocations. When preceded by a body part noun in
dative case it refers to something wrong with this particular body part, e.g. ab-a:k t@- (head-
lk+dat be/stand/have) ‘be not quite right in one’s head’ (see §17.2.3).
2. The copula r @- ‘sit’ can be used as an existential verb; then it requires either a locative or a
reactivated topic demonstrative (just like the copula t@-), as in 4.19.
4.19 mak@n      r@-na                       væk aka
     mourning sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt pan dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
     r@-na
     sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘The pan “in mourning” (that is, a pan with a string of black wool on it) is (here)!’
This same verb also means ‘sit’, e.g. t@k@r -@-m r @-k-na-wun (stool-lk-loc sit-fut-act.foc-
1fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I will sit on a stool’.
84     4 Word Classes   The choice between t@- and r @- as existential verbs is partly determined by the nature of
the copula subject. Similarly to many languages of Papua New Guinea (see Aikhenvald 2000:
166–9 for an overview), the verb t@- ‘stand’ is used with referents which are prototypically
vertical—humans, spirits, animate beings, and trees. The verb r @- ‘sit’ is used with large, squat,
inanimate referents, such as ‘pan’ in 4.19. This is reminiscent of classiﬁcatory verbs—see §17.2.3
for arguments against the analysis of Manambu copula as purely classiﬁcatory. The verb t@-
can optionally replace r @- as an existential. Both t@- and r @- have one suppletive imperative
ada.
   The copula r@- ‘sit’ can take the adjective yara ‘well’ as its copula complement, e.g. yara r@-
na-wun ‘I am ﬁne’; as well as a number of nouns marked with the locative case, e.g. stua-m r@-
(store-loc sit) ‘be for sale in a store’ (see §17.2.3).
3. The copula kwa- ‘stay’ is used with some adjectives and nouns as copula complement, e.g.
yara ‘well’, as in 4.20, an answer to a conventional question ‘are you ﬁne’? The use of kwa- as
an auxiliary is discussed in §17.2.1; its use in lexicalized complex verbs is addressed in §17.3.
4.20 yara kwa-na-wun
     well stay-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am ﬁne’
4. The copula yi- occurs with a few abstract nouns, such as suan ‘diﬃcult’ in 4.7 and 13.80,
and some onomatopoeic-like expressions, e.g. kr@sakr@s (scratchy) in 4.21. Similarly to the
polyfunctional verbs discussed so far, yi- can be interpreted as a support verb as well as an
existential copula. Unlike the verbs under 6–10 below, yi-can also be used as an open-class
verb.
4.21 wun-a kwa:l kr@sakr@s yi-na
     I-lk throat ‘scratchy’ be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘My throat is scratchy’
   This same verb is used with the nominal s@kul@k ‘cooking’ to mean ‘cook’. This construction
can be used without a second argument (‘do the cooking’) or with a second argument (‘cook
something’). However, just as with the verb t@- in the meaning ‘have’, this second argument is
not an object: it cannot be cross-referenced or referred to with the reactivated topic demon-
strative.
   The verb yi- in combination with kwas@k (possibly, a dative case form of the adjective kwasa
‘small’) means ‘be unwilling to do something, or be tired of someone or something’ (kwas@k
can be replaced by Tok Pisin les, as in 22.35). It takes an additional, non-O, NP argument in
the dative case, as in 4.22. Or it can occur with a postposed irrealis complement clause, as in
13.81. This behaviour is somewhat unusual in Manambu (where the matrix verb tends to be
sentence ﬁnal: see §20.2 on discourse motivations for the constituent order).
4.22 l@-k@-k           kwas@k yi-na-wun
     3fem.sg-obl-dat unwilling be-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am fed up with her’
   The copula yi- has the same form as the intransitive verb yi- ‘go’ and the transitive verb yi-
‘say, speak’ (see §21.1.3 on the syntactic diﬀerences between speech verbs in Manambu). These
three verbs share all forms, except the imperative: as we will see in §13.1, the verb ‘go’ has a
suppletive imperative ma:y, while the verb ‘say’ and the copula share a regular imperative a-y.
Given that, cross-linguistically, the verb ‘say’ often becomes a copula, we hypothesize that the
                                                                                 4.2 Verbs       85two could be linked in Manambu. The component yi- as V1 in a few compound verbs (§15.2.3),
e.g. yi-pa:kw- ‘hide something’ (where pa:kw- means ‘be hidden’), is also likely to be connected
to the verb ‘say’.
5. The verb kur- occurs as a copula verb in the meaning of ‘become fully, reach, arrive to be
something’, as in 4.23. Its copula complement is always a noun.
4.23 du-a-ñan      ata kur@-d
     man-lk-child then become.fully-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘He then reached the stage of being a boy’
This verb is also used as a transitive lexical verb meaning ‘do, make, get, take, procure’, e.g.
yawi kur- (work do-) ‘work, do a job’. With a same-subject purposive lexical verb, it forms an
imminent construction, ‘be about to’ (§17.1.2), as in kiya-k kur- (die-purp.ss do/get-) ‘be about
to die’.
As mentioned above, the remaining ﬁve verbs are inherently ambiguous in their status: they
can be equally well interpreted either as existential verbs, or as support verbs each used with a
limited number of nominals. For each of these, the ‘experiencer’ can be optionally added; this
is why it is in brackets. Without the overt subject, 4.24 means ‘it is hot’ (in general); 4.25 means
‘it is cold’ (in general), and examples at 4.26 refer to an unspeciﬁed experiencer (also see §17.2).
6. The copula or support verb na- takes physical states, natural phenomena, ideophones, and
expressives as its complements (also see 4.81).
4.24 (wun) bwiyabwi na-na
     (I)      hot        be:nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is hot’, ‘I am hot’
7. The copula or support verb tay- occurs with nouns which refer to climatic states:
4.25 (wun) n@k@r tay-na
     (I)      cold be:clim-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is cold’, ‘I am cold’
8. The copula or support verb yas@-/yasa- occurs with nouns referring to physical states and
desires. These include ka:m ‘hunger’, gu ‘water’, and kwa:l ‘neck’ (Yuanab dialect) meaning
‘feel thirsty’, s@ ‘sleep’, wus ‘urine’, di ‘shit’, and ñiki ‘blood’ (for ‘feeling reckless’).
4.26a (wun) ka:m yas@-na
      (I)    hunger be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I am hungry’
  Unlike any other polyfunctional verb, it can occur with purposive and desiderative verbs:
4.26b (wun) yaki      k@-k@r     yas@-na
      (I)    tobacco consume-des be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I want to smoke’
4.26c (l@) kur@-k        yas@-na
      (she) do-purp.ss be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She is displaying signs of having sexual desire’
4.26d kiyak        ñiki yas@-na
      die+purp.ss blood be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Do you feel reckless enough to be going to die?’
86        4 Word Classes     The subject properties of experiencer in such constructions are discussed in §20.1.4.
9. The copula or support verb say- occurs with nouns referring to two mental and physical
states—‘shame’ and ‘pins and needles’:
4.27 wap      say-na-wun
     shame be:feel-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I feel ashamed’
10. The copula or support verb yæy- occurs with ‘smell’. The source of smell (e.g. ﬂower) can
be optionally speciﬁed; otherwise the construction can have a generic reference: ‘there is a
smell’.
4.28 (maway) ya:m yæy-na
     (ﬂower) smell be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘There is a smell (of a ﬂower)’
  The polyfunctionality of the copula, support, and auxiliary verbs is in line with a few
other verbs with generic and abstract meanings (but without copular functions). These include
s@- ‘call, make’, ka- ‘take’, ku- ‘put, do’, and also the general ‘replacement’ verb m@gi- ‘do
whatever’. Many of these take part in forming lexicalized complex predicates—see §17.3.
C. The Verb ‘Give’ forms a subclass on its own. This strictly ditransitive verb has two stem
forms whose choice depends on the person of the recipient. A few languages across the world,
including some from Papua New Guinea (mostly, but not exclusively, the Highlands: Comrie
2003), display a similar pattern.
   If the recipient is ﬁrst or second person (any number or gender), the form is kwatiya-, e.g.
m@n-a:k kwatiya-k@-tua (you.masc-lk+dat give.to.nonthird.p-fut-2sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt)
‘I will give you this (thing)’. The stem alternant in the imperative and the non-future negative
is kwata:y or kw@ta:y, e.g. wun-a:k a-kwata:y! (I-lk+dat impv-give.to.nonthird.p) ‘give (some-
thing) to me’ (see §11.3.2). A ﬁrst person dual recipient is illustrated in 4.29:
4.29 [ña-n@       k@-kwa-gura-di                 bal] an-a:k
     day+lk-day eat-hab-2plsubj.vt-3plbas.vt pig 1du-lk+dat
     kwatiya-kwa-na-digwur-@k?
     give.to.nonthird.p-hab-act.foc-2plbas.vt-conf
     ‘The pigs you eat day in day out, do you give (them) to the two of us?’
   If the recipient is third person, the form is kui-, e.g. l@-k@-k a-kui! (3fem.sg-obl-dat impv-
give.to.third.p) ‘give to her’, and 4.30. The stem alternant in the non-future negative is kwa:y,
e.g. ma: kwa:y ‘did not give’ (see §11.3.2).
4.30 adiya                   s@b@n@-n kui-da-di                          a-di
     dem.dist.react.top+pl return-seq give.to.third.p-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p dem.dist-pl
     kamna:gw
     food
     ‘They gave these types of food back (to them)’
  The form kui- ‘give to third person recipient’ can be considered functionally unmarked,
for the following reasons. First, it is consistently used in reciprocal constructions, no matter
what the person of recipient is. In 4.31, the speaker is talking about us giving, or oﬀering, the
mortuary feast to each other; yet, the third person recipient form is used.
                                                                                 4.2 Verbs       874.31 k@k@t@p        awarwa kui-na-bran
     mortuary.feast rec      give.to.third.p-act.foc-1dubas.vt
     ‘We give the mortuary feast to each other’
   Secondly, the third person recipient form is used for recipients in general, in the meaning of
‘giving away’, as in 4.32.
4.32 a-b@r        marasin kui-kwa-na-b@r                           kui-ta:y
     dem.dist-du medicine give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc-3dubas.vt give.to.third.p-cotemp
     ‘They used to give medicine (to people), giving (and giving)’
  A third person recipient form is used in generic statements, even if these obviously include a
non-third person. Eight-year-old Tanina was worried about me not eating the banana I was
given, and giving everything away instead. She was sitting next to me, and I had oﬀered
the banana to her. That is, by using kui- in 4.33, she had subsumed herself (ﬁrst person)
under a generic set of recipients covered by this form. (Syntactically, this is an example of a
desubordinated cotemporaneous clause: see §19.9.) A similar example is in T2.1.
4.33 Sasa kur-ta:y       kui-ta:y               kur-ta:y   kui-ta:y
     Sasha get-cotemp give.to.third.p-cotemp get-cotemp give.to.third.p-cotemp
     ‘Sasha (keeps) getting (things) (and) giving (them away), getting (things) (and) giving
     (them away)’
Thirdly, the form kui- is the one that occurs in verb compounded structures whose meaning
is only partially predictable, e.g. kui-taka- (give.to.third.p-put-) ‘send, give away (e.g. money)’,
kui-tay-taya-n (give.to.third.p-to.side-to.side-seq) ‘give back and forth (e.g. in a situation of
exchange)’. This same form also occurs in idiomatic collocations, e.g. mawul n@ma kui- (inside
big+fem.sg give.to.third.p-) ‘be happy’, and s@p kui- (skin give.to.third.p-) ‘get used to’.
   In spontaneous speech, many speakers employ kui- for a non-third person recipient, where
one would expect kwatiya-. Teketay is a very lively story teller and a gifted natural linguist. She
used kui- and kwatiya- for non-third person interchangeably, as shown in 4.34. The ‘aberrant’
use of kui- is underlined.
4.34 ka-di t@p          a-di       jap@-wa         kur-ku       ya-ku,
     sow-pl coconut dem.dist-pl thing+lk-com get-compl.ss come-compl.ss
     ñan-a-k         kui-ku,               k@                 ñan ata
     we.pl-lk-dat give.to.third.p-compl.ss dem.prox+fem.sg child then
     kur-k-ñ@na
     get-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘Having got these coconuts with those things, having come, having given to us, then you
     will get this child’
  Later in the same story, she used kwatiya- for a ﬁrst person recipient (4.35), and then, a few
sentences later in the same story, she used kui-, for the same recipient (4.36):
4.35 wun kwatiya                      ma: [Pause] k@              ñan
     I    give.to.nonthird.p:neg neg              dem.prox+fem.sg child
     ‘I won’t give (you), this child’
4.36 ñan k@                   ñan, kui            ma:, ñ@n-a:k
     we dem.prox+fem.sg child give.to.third.p:neg neg, you.fem-lk+dat
     ‘We won’t give this child, to you’
88        4 Word Classes   Similar examples are not infrequent (see, e.g. 13.50). However, it is notable that the form
kwatiya- is hardly ever used instead of kui-. We can hypothesize that a tendency to replace the
restricted and functionally marked form kwatiya- ‘give to non-third person’ with a more widely
used and functionally unmarked form kui- ‘give to third person’ is indicative of the incipient
breakdown of the system, ultimately increasing the overall frequency of the functionally
unmarked kui- over kwatiya-, which is more restricted in the contexts in which it occurs.
   Comparative evidence, from other languages of the Ndu family, does not fully support this.
The only other language in the family with a distinction between ‘give to third person’ and ‘give
to non-third person’ is the Abelam-Wosera dialect complex. 4 The Proto-Ndu form for ‘give’ is
∗
  kwa(:)y/kw@y.
   The two forms in Abelam-Wosera are: tiyaa ‘give to non-third person’ and kwayee ‘give to
third person’. The Manambu kui- (negative kwa:y) and the Abelam kwayé ‘give to third person’
are reﬂexes of the Proto-Ndu ‘give’, while the Manambu kwatiya- (negative and imperative
(-)kwata:y) can be interpreted as a combination of kwa(y) ‘give’ and the cognate of Abelam
tiyaa ‘give to non-third person’. That is, the Manambu ‘give to non-third person’ goes back
to a compound verb. The component -tiya in kwatiya- is likely to be an archaic cognate
between Manambu and Abelam-Wosera, lost from other Ndu languages. Sound correspon-
dences between Manambu and Abelam-Wosera support this, making it unlikely for this form
to be a borrowing. (We saw in Chapter 1 that there is a certain amount of trade contact between
the Manambu and the Wosera people through barter markets; there is hardly any bilingualism,
or any substantial linguistic contact.) However, the compound itself can be interpreted as a
Manambu innovation. That some people still prefer to replace the new formation kwatiya-
with the old form kui- may reﬂect the fact that this innovation is not yet fully established in
the language. An additional complicating factor in the ‘acceptance’ of this innovation is the
lack of support from neighbouring languages with which Manambu is, or has been, in trade
or other contact in recent times: neither Iatmul (also Ndu) nor Kwoma-Washkuk (which is
not demonstrably related to Ndu languages) distinguish the third–non-third recipient forms of
‘give’. Iatmul has one form kwi- ‘give’ (Staalsen and Staalsen 1973), which is a direct reﬂex of
Proto-Ndu ∗ kw@y, while Kwoma has a form ha (Bowden 1997).
   The form kui- is unusual and perhaps archaic in one additional way. Unlike other verbs
in the language, it does not have to take the suﬃx -kwa- ‘habitual’ in the negative form. As
we will see in §12.3, the habitual aspect marked with -kwa- is likely to be the result of recent
grammaticalization of the verb kwa- ‘stay’. Two options are thus available for ‘give’ in past
habitual; there is no semantic diﬀerence between the two. The regular form, kui-kwa- ‘(not)
give habitually’, is shown in 4.37.4.37 d@-k@-k     sa:n     ak@s    kui-kwa-na-d
     he-obl-dat money neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘He never used to give him money; he never gave him money’     The non-habitual declarative form, kui-, with the habitual negator ak@s is shown in 4.38:4.38 ak@s     kui-l                         ka:b yiyi        ta:l
     neg.hab give.to.third.p-3fem.sgbas.p selﬁsh aux:red stay+3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘(She was bad), she never gave (children anything), she was selﬁsh’   4 Laycock (1965: 166) did not register the distinction of the two forms for ‘give’ in Manambu. The Abelam-Wosera
tiya form is erroneously interpreted as ‘give to me’, while the form kway is said to be used with second person recipient.
This goes against all other sources for Abelam-Wosera (e.g. Kundama, Wilson, and Sapai 1987).
                                                                                   4.2 Verbs       89  The other verb, kwatiya- ‘give to non-third person’, is always marked with -kwa- in habitual
negative constructions, as in:
4.39 brak       ak@s     kwatiya-kwa-na-d@wun
     2du+dat neg.hab give.to.nonthird.p-hab-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘I never give you two (anything)’
  If indeed the original compound form kwatiya- is a recent innovation, its grammatical
regularity in the formation of the negative habitual (in itself, a recent form) conﬁrms its recent
origin.
D. Meteorological Verbs are a small subclass. They take one obligatory argument—the
weather or time condition in the subject slot. Two verbs unequivocally belong to this class:
ja- ‘rain’, used exclusively with the subject wa:l ‘rain’, and va- ‘fall (night)’, used only with ga:n
‘night’, as in 4.40–1:
4.40 wa:l ja-na
     rain be.rain-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is raining’
4.41 ga:n aka                        va-na
     night dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg fall:night-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It was getting dark’
The subject ga:n ‘night’ controls gender agreement with the reactivated topic demonstrative in
4.41; this shows that it behaves like an intransitive subject (S). We will see in §5.2.1 that nouns
referring to time are normally feminine. These verbs cannot take any cross-referencing other
than third person; neither can they occur in imperative, form part of any verbal compound, or
take a directional suﬃx.
   They can cross-reference time, location, or manner if it is topical, in the second cross-
referencing position, as in 4.42:
4.42 n@ma        wa:l ja-la                                  s@k@r
     big+fem.sg rain be.rain-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt+lk time
     ‘time when big rain fell’
  The verb ja- is not used in any other context; unlike va- which also occurs in an idiomatic
collocation agur va- ‘snore’. Whether or not it is the same va- is an open question.
  The verb kus@- meaning ‘ﬁnish, end’ is an S=A and S=O ambitransitive (see 4.13–14, and
4.8). When used with ga:n ‘night’ in the subject slot, it means ‘completely fall (of night)’:
4.43 ga:n b@          kus@-na
     night already ﬁnish-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is dark, the night has completely fallen’
   In some ways it behaves similarly to the two meteorological verbs when used in this context—
it cannot form an imperative, or be used with a non-third person subject. Unlike meteorological
verbs, it can combine with the verb -ya- ‘come’ in V2 slot, conveying the meaning of a prolonged
gradual process, as in 4.44:
4.44 ga:n b@          kus@-ya-na
     night already ﬁnish-come-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is slowly and gradually getting dark’
90        4 Word Classes  This is a slightly unusual meaning of a -ya- compound (see §15.3.1): these typically refer
to durative action. It is not clear whether the two meanings of the verb kus@- are an instance
of polysemy or of homonymy. Only comparative evidence (hitherto unavailable) may help us
make an informed decision.
E. Complex Verbs consist of a non-verbal component (typically, a noun referring to a body
part or a state) and a lexical verb. Many such verbs describe a physical condition, e.g. 4.45:
4.45 s@p ji-na
     skin be.tired-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘(I, or another person) am/is/are tired’
   Some complex verbs contain an adverb. e.g. bas s@- (ﬁrst plant-) ‘ask’, or a component not
used anywhere else, e.g. luku kur- (? do-) ‘steal’. Some of the verbs in such constructions are not
used anywhere else, e.g. ji- ‘be tired’. Others are, e.g. s@ ‘plant’ in bas s@ ‘ask’, ga:m s@ ‘serenade,
shout’, or kwa- ‘stay’ in s@ kwa- (sleep stay) ‘be asleep, sleep’. See §17.3. Complex verbs which
involve body parts allow variation in their cross-referencing. An alternative to 4.45, ‘skin is
tired’, is 4.46:
4.46 s@p ji-na-wun
     skin be.tired-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am tired’ (lit. skin I-am-tired)
The semantic motivation for this is similar to that in copula clauses involving physical states
like cold or hunger (§17.4): the subject is likelier to be cross-referenced if it is focused—if I am
really insistent about the fact that I am fed up and can’t take any of it any longer, I am likelier
to use the second construction. No such option is available for complex verbs which do not
contain a body part term, e.g. s@ kwa- ‘sleep’ (see §17.4 and §20.1.4).
The last issue to be addressed in this section is the multiple class membership for two types
of derived verbal forms: reduplicated forms and customary activity forms with the suﬃx
-j@b@r . These can occur either as copula complements, or nominal parts of complex predicates
with support verbs, or as inﬂected verbs. (We can recall, from B above, that a non-verbal part
of a predicate with a support verb is morphologically and syntactically similar to a copula
complement.) The reduplicated form r@p@r@p ‘equal, identical’ (reduplicated form of r@p ‘be
enough’) is a copula complement in 4.47 (see §6.2.3 on this construction type called ‘argument
elaboration construction’, or ‘inclusory construction’).
4.47 Yuakalu-wa nabi r@p@r@p               t@-na-bran
     Yuakalu-com year be.enough:red have/be-act.foc-1dubas.vt
     ‘Yuakalu and I are the same age’ (lit: ‘with Yuakalu we two are same age’)
     In 4.48, r@p@r@p ‘equal, identical’ is an inﬂected verb:
4.48 mutam r@p@r@p-na-b@rb@r
     face    be.enough:red-act.foc-2dubas.vt
     ‘You two look the same’ (lit. ‘you are same face-wise’)
 In addition, reduplicated forms of stative verbs can modify a nominal in the copula comple-
ment slot, as in 4.49.
4.49 r@p@r@p         kwa:m t@-na-b@r
     be.enough:red crazy have/be-act.foc-3dubas.vt
     ‘They two are equally crazy’ (talking about two children shouting like mad)
                                                                             4.3 Adjectives      91   In 12.17 and 12.33–4, a verb inﬂected with -j@b@r ‘customary aspect’ requires a support verb
t@-, while in 12.37–9 it is an inﬂected verb. There is no meaning diﬀerence between these two.
It appears, however, that innovative speakers are more likely to treat these forms as inﬂecting
verbs than traditional speakers. As the language evolves, this may result in the expansion of the
class of inﬂecting verbs. Interestingly, this development does not aﬀect modal forms (the two
frustratives and the desiderative) which never take any verbal cross-referencing markers and
always occur as copula complements if tense needs to be expressed (see the end of §4.1.2).
                                       4.3 a d j e c t i v e sAdjectives fall into two classes: a small class of three underived ‘agreeing’ adjectives, two of
which refer to dimension, and one to value; and a smallish semi-open class of about sixteen
‘non-agreeing’ adjectives some of which are derived. These cover value, dimension, age, and
colour.","[105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"

100      4 Word Classes   Verbs are used to express some dimension concepts, e.g. kau- ‘be deep’ and v@rv@r - ‘be
shallow’; value, such as perfect or strange; physical properties, human propensity, qualiﬁcation,
e.g. r @ p- ‘be enough’, and position. Adverbs are used for speed, while diﬃculty is covered
with nominals. Similarity is expressed with postpositional structures (see §4.5.2 on k@t@k ‘like’).
Quantiﬁcation is marked with quantiﬁers (§10.5). Ordinal and cardinal numbers are a special
class (§10.6.1). An exception is ta:y ‘ﬁrst’ which is an adverb.
                                          4.4 a dv e r b sAdverbs form a semi-open heterogeneous class of over forty members. They do not have any
grammatical categories characteristic of other word classes. Their major syntactic function
is to modify verbs. Unlike manner arguments, adverbs are never cross-referenced on the
verb.
   Many underived adverbs are monosyllabic, e.g. k@ p ‘just’, ma:k ‘personally, in person’, b@
‘already’, ma: ‘again’, ta:y ‘ﬁrst, preceding’, the reﬂexive-emphatic ka:p ‘oneself, by oneself’
(4.63; §16.2.4). Some are disyllabic, e.g. (ma:) n@bay ‘not yet’, walba:b ‘close’, wayway ‘maybe’,
jaujay ‘in a sloppy, incorrect way’, and arguably also the reciprocal marker awarwa (in itself, the
comitative case form of the noun awar ‘side, sideways direction’: see §16.2.4). A few adverbs
come from nouns, e.g. s@k ‘far’, from s@k ‘long distance’; ma:k ‘in person’, from ma:k ‘face,
person’ (as in 4.69), or gañ ‘last’, related to g@ñ ‘tail’ (4.60–2).
4.60 S@sawi ta:y, d@ gañ ata yi-b@r
     Sesawi ﬁrst he last then go-3dubas.p
     ‘Sesawi went ﬁrst, he (Kamkudi) last’
   The alternative form of the same adverb is g@ñ ‘last’ which coincides with the noun ‘tail’,
and could be a back formation from the noun in its use as modiﬁer, where it also means ‘last’,
e.g. g@ñ-a ta:kw (tail-lk woman) ‘last/non-ﬁrst wife’.
   Adverbs may contain derivational suﬃxes which have the same segmental make-up as case
markers. The suﬃx -Vb is similar to the terminative case -Vb and is used to derive adverbs
from some nominals (which are typically used as copula complements), e.g. kwam-a:b (crazy-
lk+term) ‘by mistake, not thinking’, s@k-a:b (far-lk+term) ‘far, from afar, to a far point’,
from noun phrases, e.g. kwasa-m@y-a-b (little+fem.sg-very-lk-term) ‘little by little; a little bit’,
from nouns, e.g. ta:l ‘past’, tal-a:b ‘long time ago’, and from other adverbs, e.g. k@ p ‘still, yet,
just’ (see §21.2.2), k@pa:b ‘in case’, awar ‘one-sidedly’, awar-@-b ‘in turn’.
   This same formative occurs in some adverbs which do not appear to be derived (synchron-
ically), e.g. waya:b ‘in very recent past; just now’; s@ms@ma:b ‘no way’. This formative also
occurs in nakamib ‘together’, from nak, nakam@y ‘one’. The meaning of this suﬃx is hardly
predictable; similarly to the terminative case, it is stressed.
   The suﬃx -Vr is similar to the allative-instrumental case -Vr. Unlike the case suﬃx, it is not
stressed. It is used to derive adverbs from nouns, e.g. g´@ñ@r ‘later’ (cf. g@ñ ‘tail’; g@ñ´@r ‘to tail;
with tail’), from some non-agreeing adjectives, e.g. s@mir ‘along’ (from s@mi ‘long’) and páp@r
‘a little later’ (from pa:p ‘short’) and from underived adverbs, e.g. ta:y ‘before, in front, ahead’,
tá:yir ‘previously; towards the front’; m@y ‘very’, m´@yir ‘really’.
   This same formative appears in a few other adverbs, such as japwár ‘conveniently’, yapwur
‘quickly’. Note that the allative-instrumental case forms are reminiscent of adverbs in their
semantics and usage, especially if repeated, as in ab-á-r ab-á-r (head-lk-all head-lk-all)
                                                                          4.4 Adverbs       101‘head ﬁrst’. The adverb kuk´@r ‘after, later’ is also used as a postposition (see §4.5.2). A
few inherently repeated adverbs are derived from verb roots, e.g. pakwúr pakwúr (hide+all
hide+all) ‘in a secretive way’ (from pa:kw- ‘be hidden’).
   A formative -Vk, similar to the dative case marker -Vk, appears in mad@k mad@k ‘especially,
namely’. The comitative -wa appears to derive adverbs with the meaning of ‘all the referents’
from a few nouns, e.g. mi: ‘tree; high’, miy-awa ‘together; whole’, t@ p ‘village’, t@p-awa ‘the
whole village’ (see §7.9). A few derivational formatives occur on numbers (see §10.6.1) deriving
adverbs, e.g. -k@r@b ‘together’, as in v@ti-k@r@b ‘two together’. The formative -ta:y in b@ta:y
‘already’ may be cognate to the verbal cotemporaneous sequencing suﬃx -ta:y (§18.4). This
adverb is unusual in that it can occur with the verbal conﬁrmation marker -@k, beta:y@k ‘right
now, already’ (see §12.5). A few adverbs typically occur repeated, e.g. yapwur yapwur ‘quickly’,
or reduplicated, e.g. s@ms@ma:b ‘no way’, wayway, w@yw@yau ‘maybe’, and r @ka:r@k ‘properly’.
The adverbial derivational suﬃxes (none of which is productive, or semantically predictable)
are the only adverb-speciﬁc morphological property.
   A few frequently used forms containing the suﬃx -@n ‘manner sequencing’ are on the
way towards becoming grammaticalized as adverbial manner modiﬁers (see §19.9). Exam-
ples include yi:n (go+seq) ‘all along’, as in ñikiñiki yi:n k@l@b say-na-di (red go+seq
dem.prox+fem.sg+term ﬁnish-act.foc-3plbas.vt) ‘red (colour) all along (the sheet) ﬁnishes
here’, kray-in (bring-seq) ‘up until’, and s@b@n-@n (return-seq) ‘back’, as in s@b@n-@n a-kray
(return-seq impv-take) ‘take (it) back!’ However, they have hardly any of the morphological
properties of the adverbs outlined in Table 4.4. They cannot be considered bona ﬁde members
of the class of adverbs despite their meanings and can be treated on a par with verbal forms,
with one proviso: they cannot be negated independently.
   All three agreeing adjectives can be used adverbially (that is, to modify a verb, or an
adjective)—see 4.53 above. The agreeing value adjective yara ‘ﬁne’ forms part of a derived
adverb yara-kara (which contains a formative not found anywhere else in the language).
   Just like verbs, nouns, and adjectives, all adverbs can be heads of intransitive predicates.
Most adverbs can be modiﬁers in noun phrases. They do not require a linker, e.g. bas wari
(ﬁrst ﬁght) ‘ﬁghting for the ﬁrst time’, ta:yir ñaj (early+adv father’s.brother) ‘the father’s
brother (who was here) earlier’, ta:y ta:kw (early/precedingly woman) ‘ﬁrst wife’ (also see
4.77, ‘previous hole’), miya-wa du (tree+lk-com man) ‘all the men; all men together’ (also
see 15.100).
   Table 4.4 features a comparison of morphological properties and syntactic functions of
adverbs with the three other major word classes—nouns, verbs, and adjectives (see Table 4.2).
1. Negation. If an adverb is the head of an intransitive predicate, it is negated just like a
noun or an adjective in the same function: the negator ma: is placed after the predicate head
(which has no person markers); and no tense distinctions are made, e.g. s@k ma: (far neg) ‘it
is not far’—as a general statement which can refer to present, past, or future. If tense has to
be expressed, then a verbal negative construction with the copula (most often t@-) is used. See
§§14.1.1–2.
2. Compounding is typically not found with adverbs—a property they share with agreeing
adjectives. Just occasionally does an adverb form a compound, e.g. ab-a-gañ (head-lk-last)
‘very last’.
3. Reduplication of adverbs has an ‘intensive’ meaning, e.g. ka:p ‘alone, by oneself’ (also used
as a reﬂexive marker: §16.2.4), kap@-ka:p ‘really alone’, and also as in 4.61:

     d@ tay-tay
     he ﬁrst-ﬁrst
     ‘Thus stepping she went, right after (behind) him, she the very last, he the very ﬁrst’
4. Semantics of -p@k ‘like’ when it occurs with adverbs is similar to that with nouns and verbs,
e.g. miy-a-wa-p@k (tree-lk-com-like) ‘as if all, like it were all’, yabib-a-p@k (quickly-lk-like)
‘as if it were quick’. This suﬃx is not used with most monosyllabic and disyllabic adverbs.
5. The infix -ka- ‘intensive’ is used with just two adverbs: ka:p ‘on one’s own’, kap@-ka-ka:p
‘absolutely on one’s own’, and k@ p ‘just; for nothing’, k@ p-@-ka-k@ p ‘well and truly for nothing’.
6–7. An adverb can modify a verb, as shown in 4.63; this is a function adverbs share with
adjectives. An adverb can modify a nominal copula complement, but not an adjective.
8. An adverb can be a copula complement, e.g. k@p kwa-na-d (just stay-act.foc-
3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘he just stays, stays for nothing’. Some such constructions have idiomatic
meanings, e.g. ma:k kwa- (in.person stay) ‘be born’.
9–10. Just like a verb, an adverb cannot be head of an NP or an argument. An adverb can
be modiﬁed by m@yir—just like a verb, e.g. m@yir yapwur yapwur ma:j bla-kwa-na (real+adv
                                                                       4.5 Closed classes       103quickly quickly talk speak-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she speaks really fast’. This is the
only instance of an adverb modifying another adverb. One adverb, gañ ‘last’, can be modiﬁed
by m@y- ‘real, very’, just like a noun or an adjective, as in 4.62:
4.62 ada                            gañ kwa:d                 m@y-a-gañ
     dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg last stay+3masc.sgbas.p real-lk-last
     ‘Then he stayed there last, really last (the very last)’
  As shown in Table 4.4, adverbs share some properties with nouns and adjectives, and some
with verbs. Adverbs can be positioned anywhere in a clause (unless they modify a noun, in
which case they precede that noun). A clause can contain up to three adverbs in the corpus
collected, as shown in 4.63 (adverbs are in bold):
4.63 a-di         t@p      ka:p aba:b b@          kiya-di
     dem.dist-pl village alone all        already die-3plbas.p
     ‘Those (of) the village already all died by themselves’
  This is a unique syntactic property of adverbs: a clause or an NP cannot contain more than
two modiﬁers of other sorts. Some connectives are connected with demonstratives (see §4.5.3).
                                    4.5 c lo s e d c la s s e sClosed classes in Manambu include (a) personal pronouns (Table 3.3 and §10.1); (b) demon-
stratives (§10.2); (c) indeﬁnites (§10.3); (d) interrogatives (§10.4); (d) quantiﬁers, e.g, sama:sam
‘many, much’ (§10.5); and (e) numerals (§10.6). All of these, with the exception of demonstrative
and interrogative adverbs, are similar to nominals in most properties. They diﬀer in the
amount of nominal morphology they take; in their position within a noun phrase; and in their
syntactic functions (whether they can be heads of intransitive predicates, copula complements,
or modiﬁers). Demonstrative and interrogative adverbs do not take nominal cross-referencing
sets when they head a predicate.

  A generic statement concerning the cassowary’s son’s living habits involves verb-noun
compounds—he never stays in closed-up areas preferring clearings in the jungle.

      ‘Before he never used to stay in closed area. Having looked around, he would stay in an

   In contrast, in 19.34, the central character stayed on a speciﬁc clearing he had just found:
19.34 [tugwam na-l@-l                            tamia:m]    ata

      ra:d
      stay+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘He then stayed in the clearing’
  The generic meaning of a noun in a compound structure agrees with a general princi-
ple: nouns in compounds are typically non-referential and non-speciﬁc (see Mithun 1984;
Aikhenvald 2007).
  As mentioned in §9.3, verb-noun compounds are productive, and new ones are always being
coined spontaneously. Scolding her daughter for being clumsy, a mother exclaimed 19.35:
19.35 gu      kaykwa-tami:-al          a
      water spill-area-3fem.sgnom eh
      ‘Is this the area for spilling water?’
   In addition, they often get lexicalized, and acquire somewhat unpredictable meanings. So,
gra-kudi (cry-language) is not just ‘language with which people cry’; it is a term for ‘mourning
songs’, and wa-saki-ma:j (say-across.away-talk) refers to traditional stories which are trans-
mitted across generations. Similarly, ku-su-ja:p (put-up-thing) is a generic term for ‘clothing’,
ku-su-mæ:n (put-up-leg) is a generic term for ‘footwear’, and s@-kwa-ja:p (sleep-stay-thing)
is used for ‘sleeping gear’. Such compounds frequently become names. For instance, kiya-du
‘dead man’ is used as the name of a Manambu football team in Avatip whose members live not
too far from a local cemetery. 1
   In contrast, relative clauses do not undergo lexicalization. This does not mean that they
cannot give rise to names—for instance, we used to refer to the blind Ñatabi as m@l kus@-na
yawus (eye close/ﬁnish-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt father’s.sister) ‘blind father’s sister’, lit. ‘father’s
  1 A reduplicated verb used in a verb-noun compound developed a somewhat idiosyncratic meaning in vya-vya ta:b
(hit+lk-red+lk hand) ‘right hand, lit. hitting hand’. This can be alternatively interpreted as a deverbal nominalization
used as a modiﬁer to another noun (§9.1.1).
480      19 Other Dependent Clausessister whose eyes ﬁnished’, and to a sickly girl in the village as 19.17b. Each of these coinages
is, however, more of an occasionalism than a ﬁxed expression, as is the case with verb-noun
compounds.
   19.3 c lau s e l i n k i n g v i a c a s e m a r k e r ‘ i n s t e a d ’ and suffix ‘ like ’Of all case markers which can attach to verbs only the substitutive case -yæy ‘instead, rather
than, in exchange for’ is uncontroversially used to link clauses. There are two options. If the
case marker attaches to the verbal root, the subject of the dependent clause is the same as that
of a main clause, as in 19.36.
19.36 [m@y-a-mæja:r           yati-yæy] [wali-mæja:r                  wa:r

      knit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Instead of knitting with real thread (made of tree bark), she has knitted a stringbag with
      wool (lit. white people’s string)’
If the subjects are diﬀerent, the substitutive case marker attaches to the verb inﬂected with
main clause subject marker (in versatile tense). The case marker occupies the second cross-
referencing position. Examples are 19.37 and T3.40.
19.37 [ñ@n       kiya-ñ@na-yæy]                      [d@-k@-m

      kill-hit-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘Instead of you dying, you will kill him’
   In T3.40, the substitutive clause has the meaning ‘in exchange for’ (wun-a-di ñan-ugw vya-
m@na-yæy wun-aba:b aka ya-na-wun-@k (I-lk-pl child-pl kill-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-
subst I-too dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg come-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt-conf) ‘in exchange for
you killing my children, I too have come here (to kill you)’. Examples of the substitutive case
-yæy as a clause-linking device are rare in texts and in conversations. I have never heard a
negated substitutive clause used; nor are there any examples of negated substitutive clauses in
the corpus.
   Clauses linked with -p@k ‘like’ are not that scarce. We saw in §9.2 that the suﬃx -p@k ‘like’
can be used with most word classes, with somewhat diﬀerent meanings. It is used on a fully
inﬂected verb if one activity or state is compared to another. Examples are at 14.31, 14.33,
19.5, and 19.38–42. In 9.38 and 14.117, -p@k is used on a negated clause, in a slightly diﬀerent
meaning ‘as if’. The use of the dependent clause negator -ma:r- conﬁrms the dependent clause
status of the -p@k clause. There are no restrictions on tense and aspects, or the occurrence of any
main clause complex predicate, in clauses marked with -p@k. Just as in any dependent clause,
uninﬂected verbs require a support verb.

      space be/have-neg.sub-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt-like sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She sits (over there) as if there were no space’
A clause marked with -p@k can occur with t@- ‘stand/be/have’ as a support verb, as in 19.39.

      ‘It is this girl (who) is as if she had a child’  In 19.40, a -p@k clause follows an NP argument also marked with -p@k. This shows a
similarity between the -p@k clause and any oblique argument marked with -p@k ‘like’. The
-p@k clause itself occurs in a chain with a completive same-subject clause:19.40 [wun-a-p@k] [a      yi-tua-p@k]                     [r@ka:r@k yu-ku]      ma:y
      I-lk-like     then go-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-like carefully go-compl.ss go.impv
      ‘Like me, like I went, go having gone carefully’  A -p@k clause can itself be complex: in 19.41 it contains a same-subject completive clause.
In his story about how he and his mates ran away from school when they were little, David
Takendu compared this event to the ﬂight of Jews from Egypt:19.41 [a-di        ju igipt wapa-ku,          tabu-da-l-p@k]

      ‘Like Jews escaping (from) Egypt having left (it), that is how it was’  In contrast to juxtaposed clauses, a clause marked with -p@k can head a predicate of a
verbless clause:19.42 wa-kwa-bana-p@k-al
      say-hab-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-like-3fem.sgnom
      ‘(This is) like the way we usually speak’
                  19.4 p u r p o s i v e a n d d e s i d e rat i v e c lau s e s                                 19.4.1 Purposive clausesThe predicate of a purposive clause takes purposive modality, distinguishing same-subject
purposive (uninﬂected) and diﬀerent-subject purposive (partially inﬂected)—see §13.4. The
marker of same-subject purposive -Vk and the marker of diﬀerent-subject purposive -k@k (or
-k@k@k, with light verb roots) are similar to the dative case marker -Vk on nouns. The markers
may well be related. However, synchronically speaking, -Vk on nouns behaves diﬀerently from
-Vk on verbs: seemingly the same marker can attach directly to a monosyllabic noun+linker,
while to be used with a monosyllabic verb it requires the root to be reduplicated. So, the
noun s@ ‘name’ and the verb s@- ‘put, plant’ combine with -Vk yielding diﬀerent forms: sa:k
(name+lk+dat) ‘for name’ and s@sa:k (put/plant+red+purp) ‘so that (same subject) puts or
plants’ (also see §2.4).
  Same-subject purposive forms of monosyllabic verbs are homophonous with dative-aversive-
marked nominalization (§9.1.2 and §13.7). They can be easily distinguished by the ways in
which they are negated (see §14.3).
482     19 Other Dependent Clauses  The same-subject purposive marks a purpose complement of any verb if this is semantically
appropriate, indicating that the subject of the matrix verb and that of the purpose-marked verb
are identical—see 7.76, 16.75, T1.8, T1.12, and T1.14. Another example is at 19.43:19.43 [kamna:gw k@ka:k]               [hat t@-na-d]
      food         eat+red+purp.ss hard have/be-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘It was hard for him to eat food’  Same-subject purposive clauses cannot be negated: the negative pro-clause ma: has to be
used, as in 14.67 and 14.68.
  A purposive clause can precede the main clause, as in 19.43, or follow it, as in 19.44. The
order of constituents depends on pragmatics (see Chapter 20). The second line of 19.44 shows
that a purpose clause can appear with a completive clause as its matrix clause. Their subjects
are the same. And the subject of the completive clause is, in its turn, the same as that of the
main, fully inﬂected clause:19.44 [a-di        ñ@ ab@ti kus@-l@-k]                   [nagw@k
      dem.dist-pl day seven ﬁnish-3fem.sg-compl.ds sago+lk+dat

      vya-ku]        [k@ka:k]
      kill-compl.ss eat+red+purp.ss
      ‘After those seven days ﬁnished, we will go (to fetch) sago, to wash sago, having killed
      one (pig) again, for (us) to eat’  The matrix clause for a purposive clause can be a relative clause, as in 19.45. The common
argument is the O of the relative clause and a location in the main clause.19.45 [ [wi kur@-k]       kulapu-tua]                       [tami: mi

      dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg already go.up-3plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘(In) the area which I cleaned to make a house trees have already grown’  Diﬀerent-subject purposive forms are partially inﬂected, exactly like other diﬀerent-subject
forms. A diﬀerent-subject purposive clause can precede or follow the main clause—see 13.51,
13.55, and 19.46.19.46 [l@ k@ka-n-aka                                       ga:m

      plant-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt eel come-3fem.sg-purp.ds
      ‘She here is calling, so that the eel should come’  A matrix clause for a diﬀerent-subject purposive clause can be a dependent clause, as in
13.49 where it is employed as a complementation strategy. We return to this in §19.8.
  Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are negated with a dependent clause negator -ma:r- (see
14.71), unlike same-subject purposive clauses. This is a crucial diﬀerence between same-subject
and diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses (see §13.4.3).
                                                19.4 Purposive and desiderative clauses        483                                19.4.2 Desiderative clausesA desiderative form in a dependent clause always requires the same subject as that of the main
clause. Similarly to the same-subject purposive, desiderative is an uninﬂected verb. Desiderative
can express purpose, as in 12.62, 13.57–8, 19.47, 19.102, and T3.45. While the same-subject
purposive would have implied deﬁnite intention, the desiderative indicates a certain insecurity.
The desire expressed in 19.47 does not mean that the expedition will eventuate:19.47 [kapayawi-k      yi-k@r] [war-na]
      sweet.potato-dat go-des go.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She has come up (into the house) wanting to go and get sweet potatoes’   We will see in §19.8 that desiderative clauses are used as complementation strategies with
verbs of negative desire, such as ‘be unwilling’ (in 19.102). Manambu has no verb meaning
‘want’. The idea of wanting something is most frequently expressed as a speech report (using
the verb wa- ‘say’) accompanied with a desiderative clause (this is also the case in many
other languages of New Guinea and Australia: see Aikhenvald 2008, for discussion and
references).
   Unlike purposive clauses, desiderative clauses always have to be preposed to the main clause.
If they appear postposed, they typically form an independent clause juxtaposed to another
main clause. A short pause indicates a clause boundary in 19.48:19.48 [mæy        yi-t@k]        [pause] [ka:m        k@-k@r] [v@-tua]
      come.impv go-1duimpv pause breadfruit eat-des see-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [ka:m       samasa:m ra:d]
      breadfruit a.lot        sit+3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘Come, let’s go, (I) want to eat breadfruit, I saw there is a lot of breadfruit’  Just like purposive clauses, desideratives can be used within dependent clauses, as in T3.45.
Neither purposives nor desideratives can head the predicate of a verbless clause. Desiderative
in dependent clauses cannot be negated—if they have to be, a desiderative clause has to be
rephrased as a main clause, which may be cast as a speech report.
  A comparison of purposive and desiderative clauses is given in Table 19.3.
  Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations can also be used to express purpose and have the
implications of same subject (see, for instance, T2.8: ‘to wash sago’). Their syntactic and
semantic properties are considered in §13.7. Similarly to purposive and desiderative clauses,Table 19.3 Purposive and desiderative clauses Properties                Purposive (DS)           Purposive (SS)           Desiderative (SS) 1.

the basic meanings of the dative-aversive case—see §19.8.
                                  19.5 s p e e c h r e p o rt s                19.5.1 Speech report constructions and their propertiesSpeech reports are by far the most frequent clause type in Manambu discourse, and especially
in conversations. Even the small textual sample at the end of this grammar contains speech
reports in just about every third sentence.
   Speech reports are extremely versatile: besides reporting actual speech events, they are
employed to express internal speech and thought, desire and intention of third person, reason
and purpose, and a few other related meanings. Multifunctional speech reports are a feature
Manambu shares with a number of Papuan languages: speech reports often express thinking,
desire, intention, and cognition. See Aikhenvald (2008) for an overview, and a summary of
typological parameters relevant for the analysis of speech reports.
   Manambu has three verbs of speech—bla- (allomorph b@l-) ‘say/tell (something)’, yi- ‘say X,
speak (a language)’, and wa- ‘say, tell’. Of these, only the verb wa- occurs with speech reports
of any kind. The verb yi- occurs with just a few interjections as speech reports, as in ay yi-da-d
(interj say-3plsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘they shouted’ (lit. they said ay) (T1.29). A comparison
of the three verbs of speech in terms of their further properties is in §21.1.3 (Table 21.1).
   Speech reports in Manambu are multiclausal (Manambu has no reported evidentials).
Speech reports can be coextensive with a clause, or a sentence. They may be less than a clause,
containing just a vocative, as in 19.49, or an interjection, as in 19.50:
19.49 [gra-n] [ata wa-na]                    [wun-a      ñan-eee]
      cry-seq then say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt I-lk+fem.sg child-voc
      ‘She said crying: ‘Oh my chiiiild!’
19.50 [ [mm] wa-ku]       [ada                          ya:d]
      interj say-compl:ss dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Having said “mm” (an “up-to-no-good” interjection), he went oﬀ’
   Or they may consist of several sentences, as in T2.40, and T3.22–5. Speech reports can be
discontinuous—as in T1.33. Discontinuity only occurs on clause boundaries.
   Speech reports do not have any special segmental markers other than the verb of speech itself
in a framing clause. There is an optional pause between the speech report and the preceding
framing clause. Speech reports do not have the falling intonation contour of medial clauses, or
the rising contour of juxtaposed clauses.
   Speech reports can precede or follow the framing clause containing the speech verb, with a
slight preference for the former. Clear examples of speech reports preceding the framing clause
are at T1.4, T1.11, T1.12, T1.16, T1.22, T1.24, T1.28, T2.5, T2.27, T3.8, T3.13, T3.16, T3.37,
T3.40–1, T3.44, T3.47, and T3.50. Clear examples of speech reports following the framing
clause are at T1.8, T1.13, T1.18, T1.19, T1.21, T1.23, T1.24, T1.26, T1.28, T2.40, T2.57, T2.58,
T3.22, and T3.41. If a speech report follows the framing clause, another framing clause is often
added at the end of the speech report. This is frequently cast as a medial clause—as in T1.33
and T2.7. This results in what looks like a speech framing construction: ‘they said [Speech
Report] having said’. A similar example is at 19.51. The speech report is in curly brackets, and

  A speech report can itself contain a speech report. Examples are at T1.33 (where the main
character is quoting what he himself had said prior to going oﬀ to ﬁght the moon), and T3.43.
  We will now discuss further properties of speech reports in Manambu, including direct
speech reports (§19.5.2), reported commands as indirect speech reports (§19.5.3), and semi-
direct speech reports (§19.5.4). The syntactic role of speech reports is addressed at §19.5.5.
Polysemous patterns in speech reports are analysed in §19.5.6.","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512]"

        ‘At night she having gone straight on the road ﬁrst entered the house’
The temporal noun ga:n in the ﬁrst clause is unmarked for case (as expected: §7.2). An unusually long
vowel in the sequential form yi::n iconically reﬂects the distance travelled. In the last clause the oblique
appears after the verb—see §20.2.

        ‘Having gone to another house, she sat on the big post listening to what was above’
An unusually long vowel in the sequential form yi::n iconically reﬂects the distance. The directional form
of the verb ‘hear’ is used adverbially, just as in 16.59 (see the discussion there).

        ‘She sat listening for that name, thinking (lit. having said), “They will call the name of Oselo” ’
The argument of the verb ‘listen’, a noun phrase ‘for that name’ is split oﬀ from the verb by a completive
medial clause expressing internal speech or thinking of the snake (with the verb of speech: see §19.5.6).
  T3.29 [r@-p r@-p r@-p r@-p t@-ku]               [n@k@          wiya:r          ma: ata

        ‘Having sat and sat and sat and sat in vain, she then went again to another house’
The ﬁrst clause contains a durative frustrative (§13.6). Repetition of the frustrative form reﬂects the length
of ‘sitting’.

        ‘Having gone to another house, she sat on the big post listening to what was above’
The directional form of the verb ‘hear’ is used adverbially, just as in 16.59 (see the discussion there) and
in T3.27.
  T3.31 [wuk@-su:n] [r@-l@-l]                            [r@-p r@-p r@-p r@-p] [ma: s@ki]

        ‘She sat listening in the upward direction (that time), she sat and sat and sat and sat, (they) did
        not call the name’
The ﬁrst clause contains a sequencing form of the verb ‘listen’ accompanied by a directional (in contrast
to an adverbial use of the same form in T3.27, and T3.30). Time is cross-referenced in the second position
of the predicate of the second clause. The next clause contains a durative frustrative (§13.6).

        diﬃcult go+3fem.sgbas.p
        ‘She went that time, but his smell too was very diﬃcult to smell’
Time is cross-referenced in the second position of the predicate of the ﬁrst clause. The next clause is linked
to the preceding one with the connective aw (see §19.6) which has a contrastive meaning. The last clause
contains a nominalization (wuk@wuk ‘smelling’) as a complementation strategy with the verb ‘be diﬃcult’.
  T3.34 [ [a:bab-a du ta:kw] d@y-a-k@                   ya:m] [d@-k@-wa ras@gwa-d@-l@k]

        smell:red neg
        ‘Since the smell of all the people mixed up with him, there was no possibility of smelling (it)’
The ﬁrst clause is a causal clause (see §18.7). It contains a complex possessive noun phrase (see §20.1.1).
The second clause contains a negated nominalization (§14.3.3) in the meaning of ‘absolute’ negation.
  T3.35 [ya-n]    [wuk@wuk suan        yi-l@-k]               [aka                          k@p

        ‘Having come, as it was diﬃcult to smell, having gone just like that she went to a third house’
The second clause cross-references third person which could well be the mother snake. However, the
predicate of this clause is cross-referenced for diﬀerent subject; and the snake is the main character and
the subject of this whole sentence. This indicates that the second clause contains a ‘body part construction’
or that the nominalization is in the S function (see §17.4 and §20.1.4). In the next clause, k@ p ‘just’ has an
overtone of ‘for nothing’—see Chapter 21 on its other meanings. The form mugul-a-wi could also mean
‘three houses’ (see §20.1.1); here it means ‘number three house’.

        aka]
        dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
        ‘She went (that time) to a third house’
The constituent in brackets in the ﬁrst clause is a noun phrase with two modiﬁers (see §20.1.1). The
reactivated topic demonstrative referring to time (cross-referenced in the second position on the verb) is
postposed to the verb—see §20.2.
  T3.37 [r@-l@-k                r@-l@-k                r@-l@-k]             [yi::n]        [ga:n

        ‘As she sat, as she sat, as she sat, on and on, the night had completely fallen, she having said,
        “Oh, no (or nothing)”, went to another house’
The three occurrences of r@-l@-k are pronounced as one intonation unit (without a break). The repetition
iconically reﬂects the length of the action. The next clause consists of yi:n, literally, ‘going’, used adver-
bially in the meaning ‘on and on’ (see §18.2), and lengthened to reﬂect the amount of time the snake
spent sitting. The speech report consists of just an interjection and a negative pro-clause which can be
translated as ‘no’ or as ‘nothing’.

The ﬁrst word in the ﬁrst clause of the speech report is in a vocative form (marked by lengthening the
vowel of the last syllable: §2.1.3). In the next clause, a very dark night is referred to as a big-masculine
night: see §5.2.1. The next clause contains an inclusory construction (‘we with children’ meaning ‘children
and I’). The dative-aversive nominalization in this clause refers to an intention—see §13.7. The next speech
report is by the snake. It starts with the interjection mm (see §2.1.3)—a marker of ‘warning’, indicating
that the speaker is up to no good. The constituent in brackets is a lengthy noun phrase—see §20.1.1.
The next clause contains a threat which sounds almost like a prediction, due to the conﬁrmation marker:
‘today you will die’. The use of substitutive case as a clause-linking device was discussed in §19.3. And see
§20.4.2, for the functions of ya:kya clauses.

and this constituent shows that this is an afterthought (see §20.2). The second clause contains a vocative
form of the ﬁnal verb (§2.1.3). The dependent medial clause following the clause with the verb of speech

the third clause are appositional noun phrases—see §20.1.1. The next clause contains a headless relative
clause with comitative marking on it (see §19.2.1). Clause 11 contains the generic verb m@gi- ‘do whatever’
used as a cover term for a variety of possible verbs of hitting and killing (see §21.3.2). The next two clauses
are juxtaposed to this clause, providing further speciﬁcation of the action. In the last clause of the speech
report the oblique ‘with a white man’s knife’ follows the verb (see §20.2).

The bracketed clause within the ﬁrst clause is elliptical—see §20.4.3. This is an example of a discontinuous
speech report; note that the speech verb wa- intervenes between clausal constituents. The ﬁrst clause after
662      Textsthe speech verb wa- contains an instance of the predicate in a contrastive focus construction (see §20.3).
The last clause consists just of ya:k—see §20.4.2 on the function of ya:k(ya) clauses.
  Oselo’s children are now saying that it is safe for them to go to the bush now that there are no more
snakes there.

        ‘Having eaten food, after children (and) wife went inside (their mosquito nets) to sleep, Oselo,

The ﬁrst clause contains the generic completive verb napa- (see §18.9) denoting that the process of
eating food was completed. The ﬁrst word in this clause, kamna:, is a variant of kamna:gw (see A3
in §2.6). The second clause has a complex structure: it consists of a matrix clause and a desiderative
clause indicating the intention (‘to sleep’). A desiderative rather than same-subject purposive is used here
because presumably neither the wife nor the children got much sleep that night—see below. The verb
wula- in this context means ‘go inside the mosquito net’.
  T3.46 [Os@lo ñ@g-a:r                 wula-d@-l]                            [agur ata

Time is cross-referenced on the predicate of the ﬁrst clause. The second clause contains a lexicalized
complex predicate agur væ- ‘snore’ (see §17.3). The last word in this clause is an expressive imitating the
sound of the man snoring.

        said (this), OK, she climbed up straight on top of the big post, going up and up’
In her speech introduced by the verb wa-, the mother snake makes a prediction which sounds like a threat.
The verb of speech is used twice, as is typical for a speech report framing construction (see §19.5.1). Time
is cross-referenced on the predicate of the next clause. The sequencing medial clause is postposed to it
(see §20.2). The prolonged ﬁnal vowel iconically reﬂects slow and lengthy movement by the snake.

The constituent in brackets in the third clause is a complex predicate with anterior meaning—see §17.1.1.
In the last clause, the form miyawa (which contains a comitative marker -wa in its derivational meaning:

The second clause contains a negated nominalization in its predicate slot. The fourth clause contains a
complex predicate with the meaning of imminent modality, ‘be about to’ (§17.1.2). The next two clauses
contain vocative forms of the predicate (see §2.1.3). The last clause contains a negated nominalization in
the predicate slot.

The predicate of the second clause cross-references the object (snake) in the second position; the object
is also expressed with the pronoun ‘she’ (which is not marked for object case because case marking is not
compatible with non-word class-changing suﬃxes, such as -aba:b ‘too’ (see §9.2)).

This last clause of the story contains a typical ending: when a story ﬁnishes it is understood as ‘going back
to where it came from’. Note a slight diﬀerence in the form of the verb and constituent order (whereby
the reactivated topic demonstrative is postposed to the verb: see §20.2) between this ending and T2.69:
here the speaker had felt that his story had gone on for too long, and in this sentence the fact of its ﬁnally
coming to an end is in the sentence-ﬁnal position marking its ‘unexpectedness’ (see §20.2). Not so in
T2.69 which was a traditional story and, according to the speaker, ﬁnished in due course.
           VocabularyOnly words occurring in the examples and texts above are listed here. Each root is speciﬁed for its word
class, and transitivity (in the case of verbs). Roots which require suﬃxes (that is, verbs) have a hyphen (-)
at the end. Verb roots are given in their positive declarative root form (e.g. wuk@- ‘hear, listen’ or wa- ‘say,
speak’). For nominal components of complex verbs, we include the support verb used (in brackets). A
morphologically complex word is divided into morphemes. Diﬀerent meanings of homophonous lexemes
are separated with a semicolon (;), as in kap@- ‘cut grass; wait’. Diﬀerent meanings of polysemous lexemes
are separated with a comma, as in ñan ‘child, youngster (in terms of age and status group), child of
someone (n)’. The following abbreviations are used:
adj        adjective
adv        adverb (including time words)
conn       connective
cp         complex predicate
interj     interjection
n          noun

vtr        transitive and ambitransitive verb
I have not included here grammatical markers and members of closed classes discussed elsewhere in
the grammar, such as pronouns or postpositions. Neither have productive or semi-productive derivations
(such as nominalizations or causatives) been included. Aﬃxes are included in the list of aﬃxes. Loanwords
and code-switches in Tok Pisin and English have not been included. A list of kinship terms is in Table 6.1.
   Entries are translated with one or two English words that give some indication of the most central

                       8.2.3 Possessor cross-referencing on the verbSince the possessed noun, and not the possessor, is the head of any possessive noun phrase in
that it controls agreement on the modiﬁers and on the predicate, the possessor cannot normally
be cross-referenced on the verb. It can be cross-referenced occasionally, if in contrastive focus,
178     8 Possessionas in 8.26 (the possessive construction here is of D2 type). The cross-referenced possessor is
underlined.

     ‘They used to eat my ﬂesh’ (lit. they used to eat me (on) my ﬂesh) (said the turtle)
   As shown in §7.3, under (iv), the locative-accusative -Vm case can mark a third argument
of ditransitive verbs, if the beneﬁciary or recipient is fully aﬀected, or the gift is permanent
(as in 7.27). Examples like 7.26 (‘The Gala married women from/of Washkuk’, or ‘belonging
to Washkuk’) and 8.27 can be considered instances of possessor raising since the possessor is
treated as the object:
8.27 [k@              a:b] vya-l@pa-d@-l                          [a

     takwa:m]
     woman+lk+acc/loc
     ‘He smashed the woman’s head’ (lit. he head-smashed that woman)
  In 7.26 and in 8.27, the possessor (‘Washkuk’ and ‘woman’ respectively) does not form one
noun phrase with the possessed (‘woman’ and ‘head’, respectively). The possessive relation-
ship is understood from the context; and the locative-accusative case indicates the complete
aﬀectedness of the possessor in each case. This ‘possessor raising’ is available for body part
possession only.
        9        Derivation and Compounding
Manambu has a few derivational mechanisms which change word class (§9.1) and a number of
those which do not (§9.2). Nominal compounding is discussed in §9.3.                     9.1 wo r d c la s s -changing derivationsFully productive action nominalizations are derived through full reduplication of the verb’s
root. These are discussed in §9.1.1, in the light of other functions of reduplicated verbal root.
Non-productive deverbal nominalizations and a partially productive adjectivizing derivation
are addressed in §9.1.2. There are no morphological means for deriving a verb from a noun.
One adjective, vyak@t ‘good, beautiful’, is related to a verb vyakanaku- ‘correct, improve’ via a
unique process. (Neither has cognates in other Ndu languages.)                9.1.1 Full reduplication of verbal root and its functionsFull reduplication of verbal root is a productive means of deriving action nominalizations, e.g.
war- ‘go up’, warwar ‘going up’; nas(@)- ‘count’, nas@nas ‘counting’ (see §2.2.1 on the insertion
of @ to break an unauthorized consonant cluster); kawar- ‘take up’, kawar-kawar- ‘carrying
and going up’; yawi kur- (work do) ‘work (verb)’, yawi kur-kur ‘doing work (noun)’.
   If a root ends in -u and undergoes full reduplication, the ﬁnal vowel is reduced to -w and,
if it follows a stop, is realized as labialization of the last consonant, as in waku ‘go out’,
wakuwakw ‘going out’. If a verb root has a structure CVC1 C2 V, and C2 is y, the ﬁnal vowel
is dropped and y becomes i , as in warya- ‘ﬁght’, warya-wari ‘ﬁghting’. Monosyllabic roots with
the vowel a acquire the shape CaC@ when reduplicated, e.g. da- ‘go down’, da-d@ ‘going down’,
ra- ‘cut’, ra-r@ ‘cutting’. Nominalizations are stressed on the last syllable; whether they form
one phonological word depends on the syllable count (see §2.5). Nominalizations can occur
in S or O function, as obliques and as part of complex predicates (see §4.1.2). They cannot
be part of a possessive NP or be modiﬁed. All nominalizations have the verb’s argument
structure and argument marking (their A/S is Ø marked, as in 9.1 and 9.4, and their O can
be unmarked, as in 9.2–3, or marked with accusative-locative case following the principles in
§7.2, e.g. 4.7).
   But is every reduplicated verb a nominalization? We will see below that the reduplicated
forms diﬀer in their semantics and in their syntactic possibilities depending on their function
and the type of additional marking they take. The broad meaning ‘action nominalization’
appears to be fully applicable to some combinations of form and function of reduplicated verb
root, and only partly so to others. We will use this term here for convenience. At the end of this
section we return to the problem of whether all these can be analysed as one category.
180      9 Derivation and CompoundingI. Nominalizations unmarked for case are used as S in 4.7–8 and 9.1; and as O in 9.2. They
cannot be used as A.
9.1 [kasan war-war] vyak@t-a
    peanut go.up-red good-3fem.sgnom
    ‘Peanuts are coming up ﬁne’ (lit. Peanuts going up is ﬁne)
  Deverbal nominalizations in O function are employed as complementation strategies, with
the verb ‘know’, as in 9.2, and ‘ﬁnish’, as in 4.8.
9.2 [na:gw k@-k@] b@r b@ta:y laku-bra
    sago eat-red 3du already know-3dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘They were eating sago, they already knew how to eat sago’ (lit. they already knew sago
    eating)
   ‘Peanuts coming up’ in 9.1 and ‘sago eating’ in 9.2 are diﬀerent from possessive constructions
of type B (§8.1.1), for two reasons. First, given the right pragmatic circumstances, another
possessive construction (types C–E) can replace a B-type possessive construction. In contrast,
no possessive construction can be used instead of an action-nominalization structure. Secondly,
an object of a nominalization can take the accusative-locative case if fully aﬀected, as in 4.7. In
all of 9.1–2 and 4.7–8 nominalizations are employed as complementation strategies (see IX in
§19.8).
   An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in 9.3 (predicate is focused: see
§20.3).
9.3 k@                  lap       kwa:j    k@-k@-l-a
    dem.prox+fem.sg banana ﬂying.fox eat-red-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
    ‘This is the way of eating of bananas by ﬂying fox’
  As can be seen from these examples, nominalizations are assigned feminine gender, in
accordance with its functionally unmarked character (see §5.2.3).
  Nominalizations are frequently used as modiﬁers to nouns, e.g. vya-vy-a ta:b (hit+lk-red-
lk hand) ‘right hand, lit. hitting hand’, wusau-wusau s@p (itch-red skin) ‘itchy skin’, væt-@-
væt-@j @pis (bite-lk-red-lk ant) ‘an ant that bites a lot’. An alternative interpretation for these
constructions as analogous to relative clauses is in §19.2.2.
II. Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used to mark a purpose, or a goal expressed
with what translates as a clausal complement. These are used where one expects the dative-
aversive case, as in 9.4 and 13.81–2.
9.4 kap@-n kwa-na                             [n@k@-di ñanugw ya-ya:k]
    wait-seq stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt other-pl children come-red+dat
    ‘She is waiting for the other children to come’ (lit. she is waiting for other children coming)
  The dative-aversive marked nominalizations are used with a variety of expressions with
negative meaning, such as ‘forbid, refuse’, literally, ‘say no’, as in 9.5, or ‘feel shame’, as in 9.6.
9.5 [m@n        kap@-ka:p da-da:k]             ma: wa-na-wun

in a more clearly aversive, ‘for fear of’, sense, as in 9.7:9.7 [ank@l s@p kag@l yi-ya:k]         marasin-al
    nettle skin sore go-red+dat medicine-3fem.sgnom
    ‘Nettle is a medicine against sore skin’ (lit. nettle is a medicine for fear of skin going sore)Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used in yet another sense—that of future projec-
tion, as in 9.8.9.8 [l@-k@-d@         ñan kiya-kiya:k] atawa kur@-d

    ‘It (the cat) was acting like this (as a premonition) for her little boy dying’We saw that a nominalization unmarked for case can be used with the expression ‘be hard’ in
4.7 where the diﬃculty is not limited to the future. If a future diﬃculty is implied, a dative-
aversive-marked nominalization is employed:9.9 [apaw@l b@u-m         t@-na]                           [ [al@k      suan
    spirit    haze-loc stay-act.foc+3fem.sg.bas.vt this.is.why hard
    yi-na-wun]                      [apaw@l-a:m v@-væk] ]
    go-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt spirit-lk+acc see-red+dat
    ‘A spirit is in a haze, this is why it is hard for me to (try and) see the spirit (in future)’   The dative-aversive nominalization can be considered a type of complementation strategy
(§19.8). Unlike other complementation strategies, they often follow the inﬂected verb. This
same form is also used in clauses introduced with k@pa:b ‘in case’—see §13.7.
   Dative-aversive nominalizations can be derived from any verb, with the exception of verbs
of C@l/r structure. So, the verb b@l-/bla- ‘talk’ forms a nominalization blab@l ‘talking’; but
not ∗ blabl@k; the same-subject purposive bla:k is used instead (see §13.4). Such gaps in the
paradigm of dative-aversive nominalizations show that their morphological possibilities do not
fully coincide with those of nominalizations discussed at I above. This could be an argument
in favour of analysing them as a separate category.
III. Terminative case-marked nominalizations marked with Vb can only be used with the
polyfunctional verb t@- as support verb. The meaning of the construction is ‘to be on the brink
of doing something; to do just so’:9.10 ñ@n-a-d@             majan          kui-kuib         t@-na-dian
     you.fem-lk-masc.sg funerary.ritual give-red+term have/be-act.foc-1plbas.vt
     ‘We are about to oﬀer you a funerary rite (because we thought you were dead)’The support verb can be omitted, if its subject is coreferential with that of a juxtaposed
clause:9.11 [kuprap-@ du taba:m               r@-ku]      [ya:n]        [r@-tua
     bad-lk       man hand+lk+loc sit-compl.ss come+seq sit-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     aka                         kiya-kiya:b]
     dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg die-red+term
     ‘Sitting in the bad man’s hands, having come, here I sit, on the brink of dying’
182     9 Derivation and CompoundingThe meanings of -Vb with nominalizations agree with the general semantics of the terminative
case (see §7.6). Noun phrases marked with terminative case are typically used as obliques,
unlike nominalizations with the same marking.
IV. Nominalizations as parts of complex predicates with the verb t@- ‘be, stand, have’ as
a support verb have an intensive and habitual meaning, as in 9.12. Compare 9.12a, with an
inﬂected verb, and 9.12b, with a nominalization as part of a complex predicate.9.12a day-a:k       warsamad
      they-lk+dat be.angry+3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘He is angry at them’9.12b day-a:k       warsam-warsam t@-na-d
      they-lk+dat be.angry-red    be-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘He is very angry at them’   The verb bla means ‘speak; say magic spells’; a person who keeps saying magic spells is called
yanu bla-b@l t@-kwa-na-d-@ du (spell say-red stand/have-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk man).
Similarly, wuk@mar means ‘forget’, wuk@mar wuk@mar t@- means ‘be forgetful’.
   The meaning of a reduplicated nominalization may be only partially predictable: for
instance, reduplicated r@p ‘be full, satisﬁed’ within a complex predicate means ‘equal, same
as’, as in 4.47.
   An analytical problem arises here. At the end of §4.2.2 we mentioned multiple word class
membership of fully reduplicated verbal roots. Most of them can be used as inﬂected verbs
(in which case they are interpreted as intensive aspect forms: see §12.8), and also as parts of
complex predicates. This was illustrated with examples 4.47–8; also see 9.13a–b:9.13a a-di        pato wali-wali        t@-na-di
      dem.dist-pl duck walk.around-red be-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Those ducks keep wandering around’9.13b a-di        pato wali-wali-na-di
      dem.dist-pl duck walk.around-red-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Those ducks are wandering around all the time’   For dynamic verbs, like wali- ‘wander around’, there appears to be a subtle diﬀerence:
nominalizations as parts of complex predicates refer to an atemporal action that keeps repeat-
ing, while inﬂected verbs describe something that is happening either right now or at some
particular time (this is why the action focus marker is preferred in examples like 9.13a–b). For
stative verbs there is no such diﬀerence.
   In addition, a reduplicated verb root can occur as part of a complex predicate with support
verbs other than t@- ‘be, stand’, with the basic meaning of action nominalization. The noise
of rolling is described in 9.14, and this warrants the use of the polyfunctional verb na- ‘be (of
natural phenomena, including noise)’:9.14 t@m@l-t@m@l ata na:l
     roll-red     then be:nat+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘There was a noise of (him) rolling and rolling’
                                                      9.1 Word class-changing derivations     183   The reduplicated root triggers feminine agreement, like any nominalization in S function.
Examples like 9.14 are infrequent; nevertheless, they point towards a diﬀerent nature of redu-
plicated verb roots with a support verb and verbal nominalizations.
V. Emphatic nominalizations are used as manner modiﬁers to a semantically similar (or the
same) verb, as in 9.15.
9.15 wuk@-wuk wuk@-tua
     hear-red hear-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am just listening’ (not saying anything; lit. listening I listen)
  The emphatic nominalization constructions often have a frustrative connotation: in 9.16
there is an overt contrast between ‘just hearing’ and ‘really talking’.
9.16 wuk@-wuk wuk@-na                       yi-yi      suan yi-na
     hear-red hear-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt talk-red hard go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She does hear (understand) (the language), talking is diﬃcult’ (lit. hearing she hears,
     talking is diﬃcult)
  A nominalization containing a diﬀerent, but semantically similar, root can modify a verb,
denoting a manner in which the action is performed, as in 9.17:
9.17 væs@-væs ma:y
     step-red go.impv
     ‘Go by stepping carefully’
  Just occasionally can a reduplicated verb root be used to modify a verb of a diﬀerent
semantic group, as in 9.18:
9.18 wiya:m          aw       t@m@l-t@m@l aw         t@m@l-t@m@l ata gra:l
     house+lk+loc in.turn roll-red          in.turn roll-red      then cry+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘At home she then cried in turn rolling and rolling (lamenting her drowned son)’
VI. Nominalizations in negative constructions as predicate heads are a means of expressing
negative obligation. This is consistent with a typologically widely attested pattern whereby
non-verbal forms are used to express curt commands and strong prohibitions (Aikhenvald
forthcoming a). In 9.19, the mother was trying to explain to her baby daughter that one does
not breastfeed while walking along the road:
9.19 yab@-wa       m@ñ k@-k@ ma:
     road+lk-com breast eat-red neg
     ‘One does not breastfeed while walking’ (lit. There is no breastfeeding along the road)
  Such negative statements can refer to something that has not happened yet (as in 9.19 said
before the girl had started breastfeeding—see 7.80), or to something that has already occurred.
  The position of the negator is congruent with its position in clauses with a non-verbal
predicate (see §14.1.2). However, an additional problem arises here. We will see in §14.3.3 that
the negative form of the reduplicated intensive aspect of a verb coincides with the reduplicated
verb stem, that is, a nominalization. In negative future, the negator is postposed to the negative
form of an inﬂected verb, making a construction like 9.20 (and in T1.7) inherently ambiguous
between (a) a negated nominalization as a means of expressing negative obligation; and (b) a
negative future of the intensive aspect.
184      9 Derivation and Compounding9.20 l@ wun-a          takwa:m              v@-v@     ma:.
     she I-lk+fem.sg wife+lk+acc/loc see-red neg
     (a) ‘She (the moon) is not to see my wife’
     (b) ‘She (the moon) will not be intensively staring at my wife’
  This ambiguity can be resolved by the context. Interestingly, both readings are possible in
the humorous story from which the example 9.20 is taken. The story is about a naive newly
wed young man who had no idea that women menstruate, literally, ‘see moon’, once a month.
He decides to stop the moon from seeing his wife by killing the moon (cf. 3.15), and says 9.20.
  The reduplicated forms discussed in I–V cannot be negated independently (see §14.1.3). For
instance, a reduplicated deverbal nominalization as part of a complex predicate (IV above) is
negated in the same way as any other clause containing the support verb t@- ‘stand, be, have’.
9.21 wuk@mar-wuk@mar ak@s          t@-kwa-na-wun
     forget-red            neg.hab stand-hab-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am never forgetful’
The diﬀerences in semantics and functions of reduplicated verb root discussed in I–VI are
summarized in Table 9.1.
   Just like with cases (§7.10), one may wish to follow a ‘lumper’ approach, and consider all
instances of reduplicated verbs in Manambu as essentially one category with six diﬀerent
functions. The fact that six diﬀerent functions are in a complementary distribution as to the
additional marking and syntactic functions of the reduplicated root is a strong argument in
favour of this approach.
   Alternatively, one can follow a ‘splitter’ approach, and distinguish several semantic and
functional categories expressed with homophonous forms: (i) deverbal action nominalization:
structures I–III and VI; and (ii) non-inﬂected verb with intensive-habitual meanings: IV and
V. Once used as head of predicates, deverbal action nominalizations are reinterpreted as a
modality (§13.7).
   The meaning diﬀerences between reduplicated verb root in constructions I–III and in IV are
substantial. In addition, the reduplicated verb root as part of a complex predicate in IV can be
replaced with an inﬂected verb form containing the same reduplicated verbal root, as shown
in 9.13a–b. Reduplicated verb roots as parts of complex predicates may well be considered
a special grammatical form of a verb, which is only superﬁcially similar to nominalizations
discussed under I–III. The two analytic alternatives are equally valid.","[204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211]"

                        16.2.4 Reciprocal-associative, and reﬂexivesNeither reciprocals nor reﬂexives are expressed with a valency-changing verbal derivation. The
reciprocal and associative marker awar-wa is the comitative of the inherently locational noun
awar ‘side; sideways direction’ (see §4.4). Both reciprocal and associative uses are consistent
with the meaning of the comitative. We saw in §7.9 that the comitative marks a participant
                                                          16.2 Valency-changing devices      419in an inherently reciprocal action, such as ‘mixing, putting together’ in T3.20 and ‘ﬁghting’
in 7.71. A comitative can mark a participant involved in a reciprocal activity, with the overt
awarwa as in 16.93a, or without it, as in 7.78.
16.93a ñan gur-a-wa         awarwa v@          ma:
       we you.pl-lk-com rec            see.neg fut
       ‘We won’t see each other’ (lit. we with you plural will not see each other)
   An alternative may involve double comitative on both participants, to stress that the action
is mutual, as in 16.93b and 7.79. Both 16.93a and 16.93b are statements made by the spirit
apawul about how they are to become invisible to humans.
16.93b ñan gur-a-wa         ñan-a-wa awarwa v@      ma:
       we you.pl-lk-com we-lk-com rec       see.neg fut
       ‘We won’t see each other at all’
   In 7.79, the two comitatives are also conjoined with the noun phrase linker wa. In terms of
its behaviour and position in a clause, awarwa is identical to any adverb or oblique constituent.
Its position is preferably before the inﬂected verb, but can vary, depending on its pragmatic
status (see §20.2). The reciprocal awarwa is never used with singular A/S.
   When used in a clause containing a transitive or ditransitive verb, a reciprocal may indicate
that A is identical to O and the action is symmetrical, as in 16.93a–b, and 16.94. Once
mentioned in one clause, the reciprocal can be omitted in subsequent clauses:
16.94 [awarwa warapwi-taka-ta:y]      [na:gw warapwi-ta:y]  [yapi-ta:y] [ata
      rec        exchange-put-cotemp sago exchange-cotemp buy-cotemp then
      da-di]
      go.down-3plbas.p
      ‘Having exchanged (goods) with each other, having exchanged sago, having bought
      (things), they went downstream’
  Or it may indicate that A is identical to addressee, as in 16.95. Here, the Avatip people swore
each other to secrecy.
16.95 awarwa wa-sapwi-wa-sapwi-k              wa-sapwi-tukwa
      rec       say-be.open-say-be.open-dat say-be.open-proh.gen
      ‘As for disclosing (information) to each other, (he said): “do not disclose it” ’
  A similar example is at 16.96—‘be good to each other, treat each other well’. This is an
example of a sequencing form used as a command strategy: this is an instruction to siblings to
look after each other properly (which was particularly important since their youngest brother
had recently died by drowning):
16.96 awarwa r@ka:r@k kur@-n
      rec    properly make/do-seq
      ‘You must be good to each other’ (lit. ‘Doing properly to each other!’)
  The reciprocal may also state the identity between A and a beneﬁciary, as in 16.97a–b:
16.97a [awarwa gwar       taka-ku]      [ata adakw] [wa-b@r]
       rec      ointment put-compl.ss then stay:impv say-3dubas.p
       ‘Having applied ointment to each other, they said “Good bye (lit. stay!)” ’
420     16 Directionals and Valency-Changing Devices16.97b [ban [ñiki da-na-di               ba:n] awarwa væg@t@-ta:y] gwar       atak
       back blood go.down-act.foc-3pl back rec         wipe-cotemp ointment impv+put
       ‘Apply ointment (on) the back, the back on which blood is streaming down, to each
       other’
   A similar example is in 4.31, ‘giving mortuary feast to each other’.
   The reciprocal with an intransitive verb has an implication of multiple participants, and may
imply symmetrical action, as in 16.98. The reciprocal itself does not have to be stated, as in
7.78: the comitative marking makes the reciprocal meaning of ‘quarrelling’ obvious:
16.98 awarwa karanki          t@-na-di
      rec      angry/annoyed have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘They are annoyed with each other’
I was warned not to go out at night by myself, since I would be in danger because:
16.99 t@p-a-k@-di         du-ta:kw     awarwa kuprap t@-na-di
      village-lk-poss-pl man-woman rec          bad      be/stand-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Village people are bad to each other (and I could be aﬀected by sorcery)’
  The reciprocal may just state a general symmetrical relationship, ‘between themselves’, as
16.100 (cf. 7.26). These examples involve a transitive verb, ‘take wife; marry’:
16.100 Waskuk Gala awarwa ta:kw kra-di
       Washkuk Gala rec         wife get-3plbas.p
       ‘The Washkuk (and) the Gala intermarried between themselves’ (lit. took wives
       (from/between) each other)
   A similar example is 4.56. This is an explanation of the joking relationship with one’s
brother’s wives. The distributive noun phrase, kajal kajal (sister.in.law (brother’s wife) sis-
ter.in.law), reinforces the reciprocal meaning. The clause refers to a woman making jokes when
face to face with a brother’s wife (as in 5.16) who is a woman of the opposite clan group, and
is not a potential co-wife.
   That is, the reciprocal awarwa can mark any kind of symmetrical relationship independently
of the verb’s transitivity or the semantic roles involved. However, the semantic expectations are
somewhat diﬀerent, depending on the verb’s transitivity.
   The other meaning of awarwa is ‘associative; together’. This meaning is in line with the main
meaning of the comitative (see §7.9). This meaning is attested both with transitive and with
intransitive verbs. Example 16.101 comes from the same story as 16.100—if the Gala had not
been nasty to the Washkuk, they would have carried on marrying each other (16.100), and
building their ‘line’ of descendants together (16.101):
16.101 [k@ta-n-a:b     b@ta:y awarwa wañ ba:p taka-n] [ata kur@-n
       now-pred-too already rec          line row put-seq then do/get-seq
       kwak@-k-na-di]
       seek-fut/irr-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘Now, too, having established (lit. put down) a line, a row (of descendants) together
       already, they would have been seeking to act’
  An intransitive verb with awarwa as an associative marker is shown at 16.102.
16.102 awarwa atawa       r@-di
       rec      like.that sit-3plbas.p
       ‘Like that they stayed all together’
                                                          16.2 Valency-changing devices        421   The two meanings—reciprocal and associative—are not readily distinguishable—in 16.103
either reciprocal or associative sounds plausible. Both readings are given at 16.103.
16.103 br@-k@-b@r ta:b wula:n          awarwa kaña-b@r
       3du-poss-du hand enter+seq rec          be.stuck-3dubas.vt
       ‘Holding hands (lit. having entered their hands), (a) the two were walking stuck
       together or (b) were walking stuck to each other’
  Often only the context determines if the meaning of awarwa is reciprocal or associative.
An example is at 16.104. A man was attacked by a crocodile and was saved by another man,
Kainu, and a few others. Out of context, awarwa lagu- could have meant ‘pull each other’. In
this context, this can only mean ‘pull together’: there was no reciprocality involved, just a joint
eﬀort:
16.104 [awarwa lagu-ma:r-k@-da]                               [k@-d@            Kainu

       break-go-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt neg.irr go.up-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘If they had not pulled all together, after this Kainu brought him away from the Sepik
       River by his thigh, it (the bone) would have broken, he would have never come ashore
       again’
  In 16.105, awarwa lagu- has both associative and reciprocal meanings. It describes a dispute
between two boys: they were both pulling the coveted bow and arrow, away from each other:
16.105 a-b@r       am-a-wa       nebiya:m       k@bra                  lagu-b@r

       awarwa
       rec
       ‘Those two pulled these two (topical) bow and arrow together each away from the
       other’
   In its associative meaning, awarwa is partly synonymous with nakamib ‘together’ (see
§10.6.1), and in fact can even be replaced with it. Example 16.106 was used as a synonym
of 16.100, in an additional explanation of the relationship between the Washkuk and the Gala:
16.106 nakamib ta:kw kra-di
       together wife get-3plbas.p
       ‘They intermarried among themselves (that is, took wives (from/between) each other)’
   Examples like 16.106 bear a distinct similarity to the way wantaim ‘together, with each other’
is used in Tok Pisin. And note that the speaker who said 16.106 as a comment to 16.100 was
judged by others as speaking very ‘carelessly’: his Manambu was peppered with Tok Pisin
code-switches.
   To express a reciprocal and an associative meaning simultaneously, both awarwa and
nakamib are used. Example 16.107 described us taking a picture of each other all together—the
whole big family and neighbours were involved:
16.107 awarwa nakamib kayik kur-k@-bana
       rec      together picture get-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘We will take a picture of each other all together’
422     16 Directionals and Valency-Changing Devices   The associative has a strong overtone of ‘togetherness; being next to each other’, especially
in the case of inanimate objects, as in 16.108:
16.108 awarwa kwa-di            kamna:gw ka:n
       rec       stay-3plbas.vt food        eat+seq
       ‘eating foods (which are) next to each other (lying on a smoking grid)’
  The reciprocal/associative awarwa does not occur with singular subjects. And just like most
other adverbs, it can modify a noun. Then, the meaning tends to be associative, with the
overtone of ‘something shared, joint’, as in 16.109–10:
16.109 [awarwa         ma:j] aka                           wa-tua
       rec/together story dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am telling (topical) joint story’ (shared by all Manambu groups)

       see-carry.across-see-carry.across-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘What it (the story) is is a noticeable sign (symbol) of (our) joint clans’
   However, even here the exact meaning entirely depends on the context. So, awarwa wa:r
(rec boundary/mark) means ‘joint boundary; shared boundary’. But k@-di d@ya-di awarwa
ta:kw (dem.prox-pl they+lk-pl rec woman) means ‘these women who are in a peer group
relationship to each other’, and not ‘women to each other’, or ‘women together’.
   In 16.111, the job of building a house is described as a joint enterprise. Pauline Laki, the
author of this story, translated awarwa ja:p as ‘joint work’ and also as ‘give and take process’.
This indicates the close link between reciprocal and associative meanings of which speakers are
acutely aware.

       ‘The work on the house is big, it is a thing one does together (or: to each other’)
       Pauline Laki’s literal translation: ‘enormous task of building is also a give and take
       process’
  All these examples show that associative and reciprocal meanings are intertwined, and not
so easy to tease apart. And this is where the reciprocal strategies come into play.
  We can recall, from §16.1.4, that two directionals on one verb, -saki-sala- (outward-‘inward’)
can have a reciprocal overtone (see 16.68). So can the reduplicated directional -tay- ‘sideways
away from speaker’ (see 12.67). Their major meanings have nothing to do with reciprocality.
But they are used as reciprocal strategies (with or without awarwa) as means of avoiding the
associative/reciprocal ambiguity of awarwa.
A further note on awarwa. The noun awar ‘side, sideways direction’ is an inherently locational
noun, and is most often used to indicate location (note that it does not take locative case, which
is natural for a locational noun), as in 16.112:
16.112 awar-d@ka yi:n        v@-k@-tua-d
       side-only go+seq see-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘I will go and look sideways’ (also: in a hidden way)
                                                         16.2 Valency-changing devices        423  The expression awar m@la:r (side eye+lk+instr) means ‘out of the corner of one’s eye, in a
secretive way’. When reduplicated, awar means ‘between (two similar things)’, as in 16.113:
16.113 awar awar ñ@gawa                      r@-na
       side side mosquito.net+lk+com sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘It (bag) is sitting between the mosquito nets’
  An alternative to awar in 16.113 is the connective aw ‘then, or’ (see §4.5) used when some-
thing is located between two diﬀerent objects, as in 16.114. Senapian was not on the map, but
Mali suggested that it should be between Swakap and Ambunti:
16.114 aw Swakap aw Ambunti, aw ñ@d@m
       then Swakap then Ambunti then middle+lk+loc
       r@-k-na
       sit-fut/irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘It (Senapian) should be between Swakap and Ambunti, in the middle’
   An etymological connection between awar and aw is possible, but tenuous. Had aw been
anything other than a connective, one could have hypothesized that awar is formed of aw plus
the instrumental -(a)r .
   In contrast to the reciprocal-associative, there is no dedicated reﬂexive. The reﬂexive-
emphatic ka:p ‘alone, by itself’ is used as a reﬂexive strategy. The emphatic meaning (by oneself)
and the reﬂexive meaning are diﬃcult to tease apart—see 16.69a and 16.70a. Both occur in
clauses with animate and with inanimate subjects.
   Another way of expressing a reﬂexive-emphatic meaning is with a reduplicated personal
pronoun—see §10.1, and especially example 10.11.
   An additional emphatic strategy involves the adverb ma:k ‘in person; face to face; oneself’:
16.115 n@n-a:m             ma:k   v@-k@-tua
       you.fem-lk+acc in.person see-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I will see you in person’
  This form can co-occur with a reciprocal-associative, as shown in 16.116. The referent of
ma:k can be coreferential with the subject. So far, ma:k has not been attested in a purely
reﬂexive meaning.
16.116 awarwa ma:k         ma: v@
       rec      in.person neg see:neg
       ‘(We) haven’t seen each other in person/ourselves’
         17         Complex Predicates
Manambu has a variety of complex predicates which consist of more than one grammatical
and phonological word. These include:
    (i) complex predicates containing auxiliaries—see §17.1;
   (ii) complex predicates containing support verbs—see §17.2; and
  (iii) lexicalized complex predicates—see §17.3.
  Body part and part–whole clausal constructions (referred to as ‘body part constructions’ and
‘part–whole constructions’ for short) share similarities with complex predicates—see §17.4.
Transitivity-neutralizing constructions which involve clause-chaining markers (§16.2.3) are
semantically akin to aspectual complex predicates; see §17.5. Complex predicates involving
repetition of the verb were discussed in §12.8.3. A comparison of complex predicates is in
§17.6.
  We can recall, from B under §4.2.2, that Manambu has ten polyfunctional verbs used as an
auxiliary or as a support verb, and as copulas (see Table 4.1). The bulk of this chapter focuses
on discussion of these verbs.
  Polyfunctional verbs in (i) and (ii) have a grammatical role to play. Auxiliaries impart
aspectual or modal meanings to the whole construction, and also serve as carriers for various
inﬂections. Support verbs simply serve as inﬂection carriers. A complex predicate can contain
not more than one occurrence of the same polyfunctional verb in a grammatical function,
and only one non-inﬂected component. That is, an auxiliary is usually incompatible with
a construction already containing the same verb as a support verb. Two support verbs can
occasionally occur together (as in 17.36a–b). A nominal component of a complex predicate can
never be focused. Some can be questioned—see §§17.2–3. Components of complex predicates
are underlined throughout this chapter.
              17.1 c o m p l e x p r e d i c at e s c o n ta i n i n g au x i l i a r i e sAuxiliaries are deﬁned as a closed subclass of verbs which (a) form part of one complex
predicate in combination with an uninﬂected verb from a large open class; (b) take all the
person, number, gender, aspect, tense, mood, and modality speciﬁcations required; and (c)
impart a modal or aspectual meaning to the construction. There are no restrictions on the
transitivity of the lexical verb.
   Complex predicates containing auxiliaries cannot contain stative verbs or non-verbal pred-
icate heads. As we can recall from Table 4.1, four of the polyfunctional verbs are used as
auxiliaries. The positional verbs t@- ‘stand’, r@- ‘sit’, and kwa- ‘stay’ mark anterior and durative
aspects in complex predicates. (They are glossed as ‘stand’, ‘sit’, and ‘stay’ in their auxiliary and
support verb functions throughout this chapter.) Aspectual complex predicates consist of a
lexical verb marked with the manner sequencing suﬃx -n and an auxiliary. Aspectual complex
predicates are discussed in §17.1.1. The verb kur- ‘do, get, become (fully)’ marks imminent

verb (§17.1.2).
   Complex predicates discussed in this section can be used in a main and in a dependent clause.
An additional type of complex predicate with temporal meaning is restricted to dependent
clauses. It consists of a verb marked with the sequential -n and the generic completive verb
napa- accompanied by the appropriate clause-chaining markers (as in 17.25b)—see §18.9.
Modal complex predicates of yet another type consist of one of the two modal verbs both
meaning ‘be able to, can’ followed by an inﬂected verb. These complex predicates cannot be
negated, questioned, or occur in a command; neither can they take any of the modalities
discussed in Chapter 13. (See §4.5.1.)                   17.1.1 Aspectual and positional complex predicatesAspectual complex predicates express (A) anterior aspect, (B) durative aspect, and (C) pro-
longed durative aspect. The polyfunctional verbs which occur in all three aspectual complex
predicates are also used as positional verbs. In these constructions, they tend to be bleached
of their positional meanings. We will see, under (B), that this bleaching is incomplete, and that
positional verbs sometimes retain their meanings to do with ‘standing’ and ‘sitting’. Since their
choice does not correlate with the shape or any other inherent property of the referent, they
cannot be considered classiﬁcatory (see Aikhenvald 2000: 159–66, on classiﬁcatory verbs in
New Guinea languages).
A. An anterior complex predicate consists of the auxiliary t@- preceded by the verb from
an open class marked with the sequential -@n. It refers to an action which may be completed
by the time of speech act, and remains relevant for the present. The focus is on the result of
an action, as is the case with other aspectual complex predicates. The action itself may, or may
not, extend to the present; it is its result that has to be relevant for the present (as in 12.71, ‘I
have completely forgotten (it)’).
   This is illustrated in 17.1, with the verb v@- ‘see/look’. The action of ‘seeing/looking’ started
prior to the timing of the main line of the story, and continues to be relevant for the rest of the
story because the people keep looking at what is happening.17.1 [a-d@             v@-s@mul-d@-k]                      [day du ta:kw ata væn

     dem.dist-masc.sg key+lk+dat look.for-seq stand-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She (the hen) has been looking for that key ever since’  An anterior complex predicate can appear in a dependent clause, as in 17.3. Kuimagan keeps
holding the baby in his arms while his wife Sirunki goes oﬀ into the bush. The action expressed
with a complex predicate (yata-n t@- (carry-seq stand-) ‘to have been carrying’) started before
Sirunki had gone oﬀ to the bush, and is continuing while she is in the bush.
426     17 Complex Predicates17.3 [Kuimagan Lai ata yata-d@-d],                                   [yata-n

     ‘Then Kuimagan held Lai (in his arms), as he was carrying him, Sirunki went inside (the
     bush)’
   The auxiliary in an aspectual complex predicate can be marked for future and for desidera-
tive modality, as illustrated in 17.4.
   In the second line, the form t@-d@-k (stand-3masc.sg-compl.ds) is an example of a head-tail
linkage whereby only the inﬂected, auxiliary, part of the complex predicate gets repeated (see
§20.4.1):
17.4 [g@ñ@r yi-ku         k@d@ka                          væn       ta:d]

     ‘Having gone oﬀ later, he had been looking (at the woman), having been looking (at her),
     “I will come with an intention of keeping on looking at her”, the man said’
The ways in which the anterior complex predicate is negated, and the issues of contiguity
in non-habitual negative anterior, were discussed in §14.1.3. Examples 14.32–3 illustrate the
semantic diﬀerence between negative anterior constructions with the declarative non-habitual
negator ma: preceding the whole construction, or just the auxiliary. If the negator precedes the
auxiliary, this implies negative anterior reading: something has not happened in the past, and
this remains relevant for the moment of speech. If the negator precedes the whole construction,
the implication is a complete lack of experience.
   A negative habitual anterior is shown in 14.49—here the habitual negator ak@s obligatorily
precedes the whole complex predicate. The meaning is ‘I have never been taking antibiotics’.
An example of positive habitual anterior is at 12.67.
   The intensive (marked via a full reduplication of the verb root) can occur in a complex
predicate with auxiliary (see §12.8.2 and §17.1.2). No modality other than the desiderative has
been attested with any of the aspectual complex predicates. Neither can the customary aspect
discussed in Chapter 12 co-occur with an aspectual complex predicate. The reasons for this are
purely formal. We can recall, from §12.7, that the customary aspect requires t@- as a support
verb to carry the necessary person-number-gender inﬂections (see §12.7 and §17.2), since it is
an uninﬂected verb. And the same verb used as a support verb and an auxiliary cannot occur
in one complex predicate.
   A complex predicate with an auxiliary can occur in a command, albeit rarely. There are no
instances of anterior commands in the corpus. We can recall, from §13.2.1, that the polyfunc-
tional verbs t@- and r@- share the suppletive imperative ada. However, all the examples with ada
as part of a complex predicate have a distinct durative meaning, and thus reﬂect the auxiliary
r@- —see B below.
B. A durative complex predicate consists of the auxiliary r@- preceded by the verb from an
open class marked with the sequential -@n. The focus is on the result of an action, as is the case
with other aspectual complex predicates. A durative complex predicate can have past, non-past,
and future reference—see 17.5–6. Further examples are at 16.88 and 16.91–2.

     I      maternal.uncle-pl house+lk+loc go.up-seq sit-fut-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘I will keep going up to the house of my maternal uncles’
  A durative complex predicate can combine with a construction containing the suﬃx -d@ka
‘only’. We can recall, from §12.8.1, that an uninﬂected verb marked with -d@ka can be accompa-
nied by an inﬂected form of the same root, to express persistence and continuity of an activity,
as in 12.50 and 17.7:
17.7 mikuli     wa-d@ka wa-n      r@-na
     complaint say-only say-seq sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She keeps only complaining all the time’
  A durative complex predicate occurs in commands, as shown in 17.8 (continuation of 17.1:
the younger brother commands the people to keep looking). Note the suppletive imperative
ada which could belong to either t@- or r@- (§13.2.1). The durative semantics of the construction
indicates that ada is a form of r@-:
17.8 [væn     ada]
     see+seq stand:impv
     ‘Keep looking’
   In the instances discussed so far, the positional verbs t@- and r@- employed as auxiliaries
appear to be bleached of their meanings ‘stand’ and ‘sit’ respectively. However, this is not
always the case. Some actions have a typical position associated with them. For instance, the
verb kap@- ‘wait’ is associated with sitting position, and as a result a durative complex predicate
in 17.9 receives an alternative interpretation as ‘she is sitting (for a long time) waiting’:
17.9 l@-k@              du-a:k         kap@-n r@-na
     she-obl+fem.sg man-lk+dat wait-seq sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She is sitting waiting for her husband’ or ‘She is waiting for her husband’
  The two positional verbs ‘stand’ and ‘sit’ preceded by a verb referring to a position in
space—such as ‘be standing’ and ‘go down’—each marked with the sequential -@n, form
complex predicates with positional, rather than aspectual, meanings. As shown in 13.1, da:n
r@- (go.down+seq sit) means ‘sit down, be seated’—also see 17.10.
17.10 ada                           da:n           r@-na-d
      dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go.down+seq sit-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      sayi:m
      boy’s.house+lk+loc
      ‘He (topical) sat down (or was sitting down) in boy’s house’
   A complex predicate ras@-n t@- (stand.up-seq stand) often means ‘stand up, be standing’ (as
in 13.2), rather than having an expected anterior reading. The verb ras@- often has an anterior
reading in its other meanings, ‘get up’ and ‘grow up’. An anterior complex predicate da:n t@-
(go.down+seq stand-) would mean ‘have gone down’; in contrast, ∗ ras@-n r@- (stand.up-seq sit)
does not make sense since, as I was told, ‘one cannot stand up and sit down at the same time’.
428     17 Complex Predicates  The positional semantics of ‘sit’ and ‘stand’ appears to be maintained in complex predicates
by analogy with copula clauses and constructions with a support verb—see §17.2 (especially
examples 17.39–40).
C. A prolonged durative complex predicate consists of the verb kwa- ‘stay’ preceded by a
verb from an open class marked with the sequential -@n. It describes an action which goes on
for a long time, longer than the one described with the durative complex predicate. In 17.11, a
prolonged durative complex predicate describes a situation that persisted for a long time.
17.11 day tayir k@-d@                    t@p      warya-n kwa-di
      they before dem.prox-masc.sg village ﬁght-seq stay-3plbas.vt/p
      ‘Before they, (the inhabitants of) this village, kept on and on ﬁghting’
  A speciﬁc time frame is stated in T2.41: a prolonged action which involved looking after
a captured Gala man took the Manambu man two weeks. Like other aspectual complex
predicates, the prolonged durative predicate can occur with future, as in 17.12:
17.12 [ñ@n a-k@s],     [wun kur@-n                 kwa-k@-tua]
      you impv-catch I        take.care.of/do-seq stay-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘You catch (shrimp), I will keep looking (after the baby)’
  It is instructive to compare the aspectual complex predicate with prolonged durative mean-
ing with the habitual aspect (§12.3 and examples 12.20–1). We can recall that the marker
of the habitual is likely to be etymologically related to the polyfunctional verb kwa- ‘stay’;
however, synchronically habitual is quite diﬀerent from other aspects, and from any of the verb
compounding structures. The habitual aspect does not combine with the durative complex
predicates. The habitual aspect does not combine with future: a future habitual meaning can
only be expressed with a complex predicate involving the verb kwa- ‘stay’. That is, 17.12 has an
additional meaning ‘I will habitually look after the baby’ (cf. 12.20). Here, the habitual and the
durative meanings can only be disambiguated by context.
  An aspectual complex predicate can contain two lexical verbs if they describe aspects of the
same action, as in 17.13a, b:
17.13a da:n          war@-n    ta:d
       go.down+seq go.up-seq stand+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
       ‘He has been going up and down’
17.13b da:n          war@-n    kwa:d
       go.down+seq go.up-seq stay+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
       ‘He keeps going up and down’
This is similar to complex predicates with the completive verb napa- (§18.9), but not to any
other complex predicate, including the imminent modality described in §17.1.2.","[445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455]"
"   Meanings (ii)–(iv) can be linked together: in these three instances the marker ata can be
seen as having a general sequential marker which acquires a special overtone when used in
diﬀerent constructions. However, ata can be in predicative focus (and then take the predicative
marker -n) only when used as (ii) and (iv)—this may be indicative of synchronically diﬀerent
form–function correlations.
   When used as a manner adverbial demonstrative, ata appears to contain the distal demon-
strative a- and is in paradigmatic opposition to similar adverbial formations containing the
proximal demonstrative k@- (see Table 10.6). This is indicative of the special status of ata in its
meaning (ii).
   Whether ata ‘how’ (meaning (i) ) and ata ‘thus’ (meaning (ii) ) are connected or not is an open
question: a link between a manner interrogative and a manner demonstrative is tempting, but
hard to prove.
   And ﬁnally, can a plausible connection between functions (i)–(iv) and function (v) be estab-
lished? Perhaps it can if a typologist allows their imagination to run wild. But this is hardly
scientiﬁc. Unfortunately, comparative evidence from other Ndu languages provides little help.
                                               22.2 The Kwoma–Manambu relationship             595A potential cognate for ata ‘negator for purposives and desideratives’ is Gala woda; however,
this requires further study. We are thus left with a problem for which no adequate solution can
at present be provided.
   Negation in Manambu is particularly problematic for morphological reconstruction. The
marking and wealth of forms are quite unusual for a Ndu language (see Chapter 14). In
particular, the negator ma: (or its variant ma:n) has few easily identiﬁable cognates in other
languages. One of these is -man in Iatmul subordinate negator -lapman; cf. also Gala map
‘negative imperative’.
   Most Ndu languages other than Manambu employ the formative -ka- as a negator (e.g.
Gala kafá ‘not, there is not’; Abelam kaapuk ‘no, not’, and Iatmul kay ‘no’). We can recall,
from §14.6, that Manambu has an inherently negative adverb kapi sapi ‘no way’ used as a
negative response and a negative pro-clause. This could well be an alliterative compound based
on the root kapi cognate to these negators (its variants are sapi kapi or just kapi). In addition,
a proximate demonstrative k@ in contrastive focus (ka, kal (dem.prox+3fem.sgnom) or kad
(dem.prox+3masc.sgnom) ) can be used as an emphatic negator, as in 10.24, 18.26, 14.41, and
14.148. Speakers consistently translate this as a demonstrative, but we cannot rule out that this
form is in fact a remnant of a Proto-Ndu negator with a velar in the ﬁrst syllable, ultimately
cognate with kapi. Once again, we are faced with a puzzle.
   As in most language families of the world, some parts of the lexicon and grammar are more
stable than others. A particularly stable feature of Ndu languages is numbers: a form na(k)
attested in Manambu and Gala n@/na- ‘one’ reconstructs to Proto-Ndu (see §10.6.1). So does
number ‘two’. Reﬂexes of Proto-Ndu ∗ v@t- ‘two’ are found in every Ndu language.
   In all the Ndu languages, number ﬁve contains the root for ‘hand’, ∗ ta:ba, accompanied by
‘one’, e.g. Abelam nak-taba, Wosera na-tamba, Iatmul taba nak (Gerd Jendraschek, p.c.), and
Gala n@ wajan ‘one hand’. Manambu displays a slightly diﬀerent pattern: the form taba:b ‘ﬁve’
consists of taba- ‘hand+lk’ accompanied by the formative -a:b, which could be cognate to -ab
‘too’, or to -a:bab ‘all’. In the neighbouring Kwoma (Bowden 1997) numbers from ﬁve upwards
contain a body part followed by abo ‘all’ (the number ‘ﬁve’ yatii abo in Kwoma translates as ‘leg
all’). The structure of ‘ﬁve’ in Manambu is likely to have been inﬂuenced by Kwoma. This takes
us to areal diﬀusion patterns, and the question of the nature of similarities between Kwoma and
Manambu.

numerous families interspersed with isolates, remains a puzzle for comparative linguists. Lan-
guages of New Guinea have suﬀered—perhaps, more than any other area in the world—at the
hands of ‘lumpers’, with their attempts to put languages together into ‘stocks’, ‘macro-stocks’,
‘micro-phyla’, and ‘macro-phyla’ based on just a few lookalikes. Laycock and Z""graggen (1975)
postulated their ‘Sepik-Ramu phylum’ based on a number of typological similarities, and a few
dubious lexical similarities (including terms for ‘child’ and ‘pig’), for which ‘cognate’ sets were
not provided.
  The Sepik River Basin (which includes East Sepik and Sandaun Provinces) is the most
complex linguistic area within New Guinea. It contains about 200 languages, an extreme
596       22 Genetic and Areal Relationshipslanguage density unparalleled anywhere else in the world. The Sepik River Basin displays
cultural as well as linguistic diversity and fragmentation, perhaps more so than any other area
of New Guinea. Reasons for this include geographic diversity, inaccessible terrains, patterns
of language contact, and language attitudes (see Foley 1986, 1988: 167–8; Aikhenvald 2004b;
Aikhenvald and Stebbins 2007), and also frequent migrations in search of further hunting and
ﬁshing grounds and sago ﬁelds (Paul Roscoe, p.c.). The average size of language communities
is signiﬁcantly lower than in the New Guinea Highlands.
   Established families in the Sepik area include the Lower Sepik family, the Lower Ramu
family, the Ndu family, the Sepik Hill family, the Ram family, and the Tama family (Aikhenvald
and Stebbins 2007). An attempt has been made to establish genetic links between the latter
four families, and other languages of the Sepik area, such as Wogamusin, Chenapian, Kwoma-
Nukuma, Kwanga, and Abau (Foley 2000, 2005a), grouping them into a larger Sepik family.
Though some similarities (including some in pronouns) appear suggestive, there are hardly
any shared paradigms, or any regular correspondences. 1 Much more comparative analysis
is required, including low-level reconstructions for individual language families, before any
deﬁnitive conclusion can be reached.
   A major problem with comparative linguistics in the New Guinea area is the misguided idea
that any linguistic similarity should be indicative of a genetic link. This is not the case.","[621, 622, 623]"

     ‘If it is the second one (second child), this is no good (ﬁrst child is more important)’  The language-internal motivation behind this is that the few connectives Manambu has
occupy exactly the same position. The same applies to nau ‘then’ which occurs in the same
place in Manambu clauses as it does in the Tok Pisin spoken by the Manambu. This clause-
chaining insert accompanies the sequencing marker, and nau forms one phonological word
with the verb:22.9 [Ya-tataka-nau]    ata wa-di
     come-imm.seq-then then say-3plbas.p
     ‘On having come, they then said’  Within a noun phrase, non-agreeing adjectives of Tok Pisin extraction occupy the same place

Pisin adjective, as would its Manambu equivalent n@k@- ‘(an)other, some’; it also precedes a
Manambu adjective, as in 22.11:
610      22 Genetic and Areal Relationships22.11 narapela ma:j wa-k@-tua                                   sampela kwasa         ma:j

      ‘I will tell another story, some little story (or other)’
   A quantiﬁer planti ‘many’ precedes the noun, just like its Manambu equivalent samasa:m
(see 22.36); and a quantiﬁer olgeta ‘all’ follows the noun, just like Manambu aba:b ‘all’; 22.12b
was the speaker’s correction of his spontaneous code-switch in 22.12a.

       ‘We all stay like this’
   In all the instances so far, the linear position of a Tok Pisin item was the same as that of its
Manambu counterpart. Not so for the numerals. We can recall, from §10.6.1, that numerals in
Manambu follow the head noun. In Tok Pisin, they precede it. When Tok Pisin wanpela ‘one, a’
appears in Manambu speech, it precedes the noun, following Moravcsik’s predictions that if a
term is borrowed, so is its linear order. Wanpela is quite frequent (and uniformly condemned as
‘bad language’). It appears with Tok Pisin nouns, as in 22.13–14, and with Manambu nouns, as
in 22.15–16 and 21.42 (where wanpela ta:kw (one:tp woman) is repeated as ta:kw nak (woman
one) ).

  The Tok Pisin form wanpela precedes any adjective in a noun phrase; it is more often found
with Tok Pisin adjectives than with those from Manambu:
22.17 wanpela liklik ma:j aka                            wa-k@-tua
      one/a       little story dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I will tell one little story’
   Occasionally, wanpela and nak ‘one’ occur in one noun phrase, reinforcing each other (as
in 21.42). We return to this in § 22.5.4. In all these instances, wanpela has nothing to do with
counting; it is an indeﬁnite introducer for a new referent. A story in Tok Pisin would start with
                                                22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English        611wanpela plus a participant—so this use of wanpela in Tok Pisin is an obvious consequence of a
tendency to ‘match genres’ in languages in contact (see Aikhenvald 2006b: 27), that is, sharing
pragmatic patterns and the ways of organizing discourse structures.
  Other borrowed numerals do not behave this way. They always precede foreign nouns, as in
T2.21 and T2.40 tu wik ‘two weeks’ (from English). Code-switching in numbers is considered a
mistake—in T2.40 the speaker corrected himself by saying wik (tp, e) viti ‘two weeks’; in T2.41
he used sande viti ‘two weeks’, lit. ‘two Sundays’.
  If used with a Manambu noun, Tok Pisin numerals typically follow them, just as a Manambu
numeral would, thus going against Moravcsik’s prediction. These numbers are used for count-
ing, and often occur accompanied by Manambu terms, in ‘parallel’ structures:22.18 n@k@-di t@n@b        foa faiv a:li taba:b kwa-na-di
      other-PL household four ﬁve four ﬁve          stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Other (clan) households are four (or) ﬁve, four (or) ﬁve’  English and Tok Pisin terms are often used for numbers bigger than ten (as in T2.65)—see
§22.4.3 below, on the motivation for this.
  The Tok Pisin preposition and adverb wantaim occurs in Manambu as a postposition, replac-
ing the postposition wuk@n ‘together, with’ (see §4.5, and 4.68–9). The postposition wantaim is
used by younger speakers, and is considered highly substandard. An example spontaneously
produced is in 22.19:22.19 m@n-a         wantaim yi-k-na-bran
      you.masc-lk with        go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
      ‘We will go together with you; you and I will go together’  Other numerous code-switches involve pro-clauses, e.g. orait ‘OK’ often used similarly to
Manambu ya:kya ‘OK’ (see §20.4.2) (also see T2.50, T2.60, T2.65), em nau ‘this is it’, and em
tasol ‘this is it, just this’. They are not morphologically or syntactically integrated. The question
about whether they can be assigned to a Manambu word class remains open.
  As we saw at the end of §4.5, the word class assignment for a number of Tok Pisin inserts is
problematic (this may justify considering them as code-switches rather than borrowings). One
such problematic word is the modal mas ‘must’ (from Tok Pisin mas) which—unlike any other
modal—can occur with an imperative-marked verb as in 13.22. Another one is tabu, from Tok
Pisin tambu, ‘be prohibited’. This form never occurs inﬂected. It can head a predicate, as in
22.20:22.20 Apat@pa-wa        g@ñ@r warya-wari tabu
      Avatip+lk-com later ﬁght-red forbidden
      ‘Later on it was forbidden to ﬁght with Avatip’Or it may form one constituent with an inﬂected verb in non-future or in future, in what
superﬁcially looks like a complement clause construction, as in 22.21–2:22.21 abra-wur              b@yib ñan tabu              r@-bana

      ‘There is no hitting them, it is forbidden for me to hit (them)’ (lit. I am forbidden I will
      hit)
  In terms of its synchronic status, tabu forms a subclass of its own.
  The Tok Pisin completive marker pinis also behaves in an unusual way when it occurs in
Manambu speech. It can head a predicate (and be modiﬁed by olgeta ‘altogether’, also from
Tok Pisin), as in 22.23, or form a whole clause, as in 22.24 (where it is preceded by a pause):
22.23 ata S@ruali pinis olgeta            ata kus@-taka-d
      then Seruali compl altogether then ﬁnish-put-3masc.sgbas.p
      adiya

      eat-seq compl.vb-compl.ss get.up-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p       compl
      ‘After they had eaten they got up, and it was all over’
If accompanied by an inﬂected verb, as in 22.25, it may be interpreted as an aspect marker: its
position is the same as that of the Tok Pisin pinis.
22.25 vya-da-k         olgeta         pinis
      hit-3pl-compl.ds altogether compl
      ‘Having completely killed all . . . ’
Mas, tabu, and pinis may be interpreted as tokens of incipient ‘loan’ morphology in Manambu
(see §4.5.6).
   Syntactic and morphological calques from Tok Pisin are diﬃcult to identify because of the
nature of Tok Pisin as a Creole language. Any structural similarity between Tok Pisin and
Manambu may well be due to the indigenous substratum in Tok Pisin itself rather than its
inﬂuence on Manambu. Such similarities include some compounds, e.g. Manambu mæn-ta:b
(leg-hand), Tok Pisin lekhan ‘hands and feet’, the polysemy of Manambu vya- ‘hit, kill’ and
Tok Pisin kilim, and numerous others.
   If the Manambu patterns used by frequent code-switchers into Tok Pisin (most, but not
all, of whom are younger than 40–50) diﬀer from those employed by traditional speakers and
display striking structural similarity to Tok Pisin, we can suspect that calquing is at work. For
instance, code-switchers tend to use the postposition wuk@n in many contexts where a comita-
tive would be expected (see §7.9), and even replace it with wantaim (see above). This reﬂects a
tendency towards analytic constructions possibly developed under Tok Pisin inﬂuence. Code-
switchers display more frequent verb-medial order than traditional speakers, which may again
be due to the Tok Pisin inﬂuence (traditional speakers have a pronounced verb-ﬁnal tendency
in their constituent order).
   The more Tok Pisin the person uses, the more impoverished their Manambu sounds—such
speakers would prefer series of juxtaposed clauses to clause chains (see Chapters 18–19), and
would rarely use certain clause-chaining markers, such as -taka ‘immediate sequence’. This
takes us to the issue of incipient language obsolescence—taken up in §22.6.1.
                                              22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English         613                   22.4.3 Functions of code-switches and borrowingsWhen children and teenagers speak among themselves, they use hardly any Manambu. Some
use Manambu to talk to their parents, and some to talk to their grandparents. In actual fact,
however, a lot of parent–child communication involves Tok Pisin, or even English. Typical
examples include 21.22 and 17.26b. Similar examples are 22.26–8. In these cases, the most
topical NP is in Tok Pisin—this goes together with Tok Pisin used as a way of getting the child
to do things. Tok Pisin inserts are in italics both in Manambu and in the English translations:
22.26 nem bilong yu aw
      name of      you impv+speak
      ‘Say your name!’
22.27 dan             ada   long graun
      go.down+seq sit.impv on ground
      ‘Sit, on the ground!’
22.28 wara bilong yæy                      kus@-k-ñ@na
      water of     paternal.grandmother ﬁnish-irr-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘You might ﬁnish oﬀ granny’s water!’ (a warning not to drink too much)
  All these examples involve commands. This takes us to a major function of Tok Pisin, as a
language of authority. This is also known as ‘directive’ function.
  Consider the following interaction. The mother was getting more and more annoyed with
the little girl trying to pull bits oﬀ the stringbag the mother was knitting. She starts telling her
oﬀ in Manambu (22.29a), and then switches to a mixture of English and Tok Pisin (22.29b):
this makes the threat real and immediate.
22.29a kur-tukwa       da-n      ada
       do-proh.gen go.down-seq sit.impv
       ‘Don’t do (it), sit down’
22.29b naughty yu stupid idiot bai mi pait-im             yu nogut tru
       naughty you stupid idiot fut i hit-trans you bad/strong really
       ‘Naughty, stupid idiot, I will hit you really strongly’
  And the threat was fulﬁlled, too: the mother hit the girl, the girl cried, and the mother
soothed her saying—in Tok Pisin—sori, mi sori. The incident was over. An alternative would
have been for the child to run away; and this was indeed her reaction to her mother’s shouting
the following:
22.30 kal                           kiya-kiya-k@-tua-ñ@n-@k                      nogut mi

      break leg hand of               you
      ‘It is this one, I will kill you, beware I might break your legs and hands’
  The ﬁrst clause is an interesting example of the verb kiya- ‘die’ used transitively meaning
‘make die, kill’. I was told that this usage is not quite grammatical.
  This kind of language socialization is strongly reminiscent of the situation in Gapun village
analysed by Kulick (1987). In both cases, code-switching and language mixing varies depending
on speech genre, and has a special illocutionary force. We will see in §22.6.1 that the sheer
614     22 Genetic and Areal Relationshipsnumber of Tok Pisin inserts may be indicative of the fact that language shift from Manambu
to Tok Pisin and English is imminent.
   English is also in the process of becoming an even stronger ‘power-talk’, especially for
those for whom Tok Pisin is the major language anyway. A group of young boys gathered
around Yuakalu’s house were obviously up to no good. Yuamali went up to them to enquire
about their intentions, and addressed them as ‘Hello boys, what are you doing here?’ The
boys muttered something unintelligible and disappeared. Using English was Yuamali’s way
of asserting her authority over the wayward youngsters. This is very similar to the ways in
which the majority languages—be it Spanish, or Portuguese, or English—are used throughout
the world by minority speakers to claim power over others (see discussion, and references, in
Aikhenvald 2002a: 187–211 and Hill and Hill 1986: 364–86). The motivation for this is fairly
straightforward: speakers of the majority language are the ones in the position of authority,
and so those who speak minority languages employ these same languages to acquire the air of
authority; this may happen consciously, or not.
   Children also code-switch when they talk to adults. A girl was trying to tell a story, and
forgot the name of the main character. In the question addressed to her mother, the possessor
(and the topic) was referred to in Tok Pisin. This agrees with the pattern illustrated in 22.26–8
above—the central, topical constituent, appears in Tok Pisin:22.31 ta:kw-al              l@-k@          t@p-a      s@      Maimwi-al
      woman-3fem.sgnom she-obl+fem.sg village-lk name Maimwi-3fem.sgnom
      du-ad                mama t@p-a      s@    bilong dispela man?
      man-3masc.sgnom mama village-lk name of            this    man
      ‘There is a woman, her village name is Maimwi, there is a man . . . Mummy, what’s the
      village name of this man?’   But, more often than not, a child would spontaneously address an adult in Tok Pisin. One
girl (11 years of age), herself a highly sophisticated speaker of Manambu, was told to get her
mother’s towel (22.32a), using the Tok Pisin word taul. Her spontaneous reaction was 22.32b;
the mother answered 22.32c (note the English loan beg rather than the Tok Pisin bek):
Mother:
22.32a wun-a        taul akray
       I-lk+fem.sg towel impv+bring
       ‘Bring my towel!’
Daughter:
22.32b i    stap we?
       pred stay where
       ’Where is it?’
Mother:
22.32c wuka                                 bega:m kwa-na
       dem.prox.addr.react.top.fem.sg bag+lk+loc stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘This here (next to you) is in the bag’   The trigger for the code-switch in this case could be the fact that the mother herself used
a Tok Pisin word (see Clyne 1987, on potential triggers for code-switching). This type of
interaction is highly frequent—and there is always enough Tok Pisin around to provide a
trigger.
                                               22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English         615  ‘Power-talk’ is not the only function of Tok Pisin: it can be used as a sort of baby talk. All
the children address their mothers and fathers in Tok Pisin (see mama as in 22.31). A speaker
lovingly said to her little niece: sindaun na kaikai ‘sit and eat’. This is also reﬂected in frequent
parallel Manambu–Tok Pisin structures, as shown in 22.33. Here, the mother was trying to
placate a crying baby, and said the same thing twice—in Manambu and in Tok Pisin:
22.33 yata-u          mama i       karim yu
      carry-1sgimpv mama pred carry you
      ‘Shall I carry you? Shall Mummy carry you?’
  In 22.34, another mother was trying to convince her baby to go and wash hands together
with her other children:
22.34 yi-nak       mipela i     was han
      go-1plimpv we        pred wash hand
      ‘Let’s go, we wash hands’
   Speakers have an explanation for this function of Tok Pisin, saying that it is easier than
Manambu for small children. And indeed, the fact is that most children acquire Tok Pisin ﬁrst.
Little Joana (about 3 in 2004) was quite good at Tok Pisin, and did not speak any Manambu
at all. And no wonder: her carers talked to her almost exclusively in Tok Pisin. Her mother
was not concerned about this in the slightest, saying, on various occasions, ‘she will speak, (in)
the village language together with the white people’s language’ (cf. 4.73). We return to this in
§22.6.2.
   Some relatives are always addressed with a Manambu term; then this is like a personal name,
and there is no code-switching. The child addressed in 22.28 always calls this grandmother yæy
(‘paternal grandmother’). This explains why the mother used this term within the noun phrase
containing a Tok Pisin code-switch.
   In summary: the major function of code-switching between Tok Pisin, English, and Man-
ambu is asserting one’s authority—that is, both Tok Pisin and English are used as ‘power-talk’;
nowadays, English is rapidly monopolizing this function. At the same time, Tok Pisin (but not
English) plays a special role in language socialization: it is considered ‘easier’ than Manambu
and is employed as a ‘baby talk’.
   Another function of Tok Pisin is filling a perceived gap in the language. Manambu
does not have a dedicated contrast marker, so tasol comes in as in 22.7 and T2.3. A similar
explanation would hold for the introduction of sapos ‘if’ in 22.8 (Manambu has a fairly
elaborate system of conditionals, but not a word for ‘if’), and for the disjunction o (as in T2.50).
There is no special word for ‘everything’—no wonder an exasperated mother exclaimed about
her baby daughter trying to grab everything: everﬁng kur@-k! (everything get-purp.ss) ‘She is
going to grab everything!’
   Similar examples abound for lexical items. Filling a lexical gap accounts for the use of
mas ‘must’, tabu ‘forbidden’, and the verb laik ‘like’. The concepts of ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’
can be expressed through using the desiderative modality, a speech report construction, a
complex predicate with the form m@yakw kwa-, or a body part construction with the noun
mawul ‘insides’. But each of these constructions is rather complex, and fraught with additional
overtones. Most speakers ﬁnd it easier to say wun laiki-na-wun ‘I like’ or wun ma: laik (I neg
like) ‘I don’t like’ rather than wun ma: wa-na-wun (I neg say-pres-1sgbas) ‘I am saying no’. Note
that the latter form is in fact ambiguous between ‘I don’t want’, ‘I don’t like’ and ‘I refuse’ (to
say ‘no’ to). Here, the introduction of Tok Pisin results in a resolution of potential ambiguity.
And this takes us to the next point.
616      22 Genetic and Areal Relationships   We saw in Chapter 21 that Manambu abounds in polysemous terms. Tok Pisin helps disam-
biguate polysemy. We can recall that wuk@- can mean ‘hear, listen, smell, obey, and worry’. By
using a Tok Pisin term wori ‘worry, miss someone’ to replace wuk@- a speaker avoids a potential
misunderstanding.
   The same word suku- is used for ‘write, carve, record’—to disambiguate these, one often
says raitim and rikodim, keeping suku- just for ‘carve’. The Manambu word ñ@g means ‘leaf,
mosquito net, paper, letter’—but the Tok Pisin word pas only means ‘letter’, and its use makes
communication more eﬃcient (see 22.6 and 22.37). We can recall, from §21.1.1, that k@- means
‘eat, drink, consume (e.g. smoke)’. Tok Pisin distinguishes kaikai ‘eat’ and dringim ‘drink’—
and some speakers, especially mothers, use these words when urging children to eat or to drink,
to ensure that the distinction is made. Along similar lines, laku means ‘know’ and ‘understand’.
And one frequently hears wun save ma: t@ (I know neg have:neg) ‘I don’t know, I have no
knowledge’ rather than wun laku-n ma: t@ (I know/understand-seq neg have:neg) ‘I don’t
know/understand, I have no knowledge/understanding’. The compound gab@-ma:j refers to
a traditional story (e.g. Texts 1 and 3) and to a teacher; many people choose unambiguous
stori and ticha, to avoid potential confusion.
   Traditional Manambu had the same word meaning ‘truth’ and ‘lie’ (sua:l); the two meanings
can be disambiguated with a special construction (see Chapter 21). But it is quicker and easier
to say giaman ‘lie’ (originally from English gammon) and tru ‘true’, or tru stori. And this takes
us to yet another function of Tok Pisin code-switches—that of a ‘shortcut’.
   The Manambu speakers themselves often lament that Tok Pisin is a ‘shortcut’—a language
where brukim means ‘break’, no matter what sort of breaking we are talking about, karim
‘carry’ covers all sorts of carrying, and kukim ‘burn’ does not allow one to distinguish diﬀerent
types of ‘burning’. (I heard similar complaints from Gala speakers who plainly stated that Tok
Pisin is not a language at all, only a ‘shortcut’.)
   However, the lure of a quick-and-easy shortcut is strong. It is easier to say stori ‘story’ than
to choose an exact term—gabu-ma:j ‘traditional story’, or wa-saki-ma:j ‘true story’ (21.37). A
short term hat ‘hat’ is easier than aba-wapi (head+lk-clothing) (see 21.38). A lengthy ap t@-
na-d-@ mi (bone/strength ‘stand’/have-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk wood) ‘hard wood’ is liable
to be replaced with short strongpela (tp) mi (m), with the same meaning. Same for higher
numerals: we can recall, from §10.6.2, that numbers higher than ten in Manambu are complex
in structure. As a result, Tok Pisin and English numbers are preferred, as an ‘easy’ option (see
T2.65).
   Manambu has several ways of saying ‘I am lazy, fed up, unwilling (to do something)’. Body
part constructions s@ p (skin) jina, sakwina (lit. skin is tired) mean ‘I am tired and fed up’
and s@p væt yina (lit. skin goes heavy) means ‘I am very tired, unwell’ (see §21.4). A complex
predicate kwas@k yinawun means ‘I am unwilling (to do something)’ (cf. 13.81). Tok Pisin
has one word, les ‘tired, unwilling, dislike’, which covers all these distinctions. Young people
and children often use les in combination with the functionally unmarked auxiliary yi- ‘go,
say’: one hears les yinawun instead of any of the four combinations above. This construction
has the same syntax as kwas@k yi- (it requires a dative-aversive-marked nominalization, as
in 9.8 and 13.81). The following example comes from a spontaneous conversation: a thirty-
something speaker refused to drink any more water (for fear of having to go down to pee at
night):22.35 les yi-na-wun                      gu    k@ka:k               wus-a:k
      tired go-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt water eat/drink+red+dat urine-lk+dat
      ‘I don’t want to drink water (or ‘I am fed up with drinking water’) for fear of urine’
                                             22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English        617   And using brukim for ‘break’ means that one does not have to be speciﬁc—we can recall
that Manambu has numerous verbs for breaking, but no generic term. This is similar to the
ways in which some speakers use the general verb m@gi- if explicitly asked to avoid excessive
code-switching, as we saw in §21.3.2.
   Speakers are aware of the fact that using Tok Pisin involves simpliﬁcation—and this attitude
is indeed reﬂected in how Tok Pisin appears to be used as ‘baby talk’. Along similar lines,
speakers of inﬂectionally complex languages—such as Bilingual Navajo—borrow ‘easy-to-
process’ words from English (Schaengold 2004: 52–7; Aikhenvald 2006b: 34). Using a Tok
Pisin word, or a whole phrase, results in levelling distinctions obligatorily made in Manambu.
   A further function of Tok Pisin inserts is getting the point across; this is similar to ‘reit-
eration’ as one of the functions of code-switching recognized by Gumperz (1982). A frequent
technique here involves parallelism, whereby native and borrowed forms appear together (see
Hajek 2006; Aikhenvald 2006b), as in 21.22, 21.57, 22.9, 22.25, T2.54, and 22.36–7. Such
parallelism may involve repetition of a whole clause, as in 21.22, 21.57, and 21.42, or a noun
phrase, as in 22.36, or a noun, as in 22.37, or just a modiﬁer, as in 22.18.22.36 planti man meri     samasama du ta:kw t@-na-di
      many man woman many+lk man woman have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘There are many people, many people’22.37 ñ@n-a:k             ñ@g pas suku-k@-tua
      you.fem-lk+dat letter letter write/carve-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      raiti-k@-tua
      write-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I will carve, write you leaf, letter’   Such parallelism has additional functions for diﬀerent speakers. Examples 22.36 and 22.37
were produced by relatively young men (around 40) who consider themselves knowledgeable
in the traditional lore. They typically code-switch with Tok Pisin, but are acutely aware of
this ‘deﬁciency’, and insert the Manambu forms whenever they can, as a sort of afterthought.
The parallelism in 22.33 had another additional function: stressing the point, and making the
speech more expressive. Note that the order of Tok Pisin and Manambu parallel forms in 22.37
diﬀers from that in 22.36 and 22.18. Example 13.22 also illustrates such a parallelism: the Tok
Pisin mas ‘must’ is accompanied by the third person command form of the verb ‘know’ (which
already has a deontic meaning of obligation: see §13.2.2). The function is to make sure the
addressee understands the importance of this obligation.
   In addition to this, code-switching may be used to stress a particular point (see Hill and Hill
1986: 377). Tok Pisin forms often sound more expressive than their Manambu equivalents.
If someone really approves of something, they are likely to exclaim Nambawan! rather than
Vyakat-a-m@y (good-lk-very) ‘very good’; or tru-al! (true-3fem.sgnom) ‘it is true!’ rather
than m@y-a sual-a ‘it is really a true story!’ During the Saki (name debate) ceremony, such
exclamations were accompanied with an often unanimous sound of appreciation (sounding
like a very loud AAAŰ-111Ů). And a negative Nogat! reﬂects a much stronger rejection than
a simple Manambu ma: or even ka (see 10.24). This diﬀerence in illocutionary force between
Tok Pisin and Manambu can be linked together with the role of Tok Pisin as a ‘power-talk’.
   We will see in §22.6 that Manambu is currently threatened by the encroachingly dominant
Tok Pisin and English. As a consequence, many speakers have word retrieval problems. And
this is where Tok Pisin insertions come into play—a Tok Pisin equivalent is the one they
618       22 Genetic and Areal Relationshipsremember ﬁrst. This is perhaps the saddest function of Tok Pisin, and the one speakers lament
most. For them, mixing Tok Pisin with Manambu results in a ‘rubbish talk’.
                22.5 new development s i n t he manambu lexiconDespite extensive code-switching, there is a marked tendency to extend the meanings of Man-
ambu words to refer to newly introduced items and activities. The maintenance of these items
is ensured by language purists (see §22.6) concerned with the survival of Manambu, and those
speakers who prefer to avoid ‘rubbish talk’—Manambu peppered with Tok Pisin inserts. In
public places outside the Manambu-speaking villages, many of these words serve the function
of ‘secret talk’—everyone would understand mani (Tok Pisin for ‘money’), but hardly anyone
would make any sense of kabak (lit. ‘stone’) or sa:n (lit. shell valuable). 4
   For instance, a riﬂe is called jarkañ (a term for bamboo shoot originally used as a storing
tube), and jarkañ l@-k@ væy (bamboo.tube 3fem.sg-poss+3fem.sg spear, lit.‘bamboo tube’s little
spear’) is the word for ‘bullet’. A term for a long piece of bamboo kañgu is used to refer to a
policeman (by reference to policemen carrying a long bamboo-like riﬂe on their shoulder).
   The word kabak ‘stone’ is used to refer to large sums of money, and sa:n ‘shell valuable’ is
used to refer to money (any quantity). The word j @l@g ‘ten shell valuables strung together’
is used for a ten-kina note. Kabas@k ‘seed’ now means ‘rice’, t@k-@-mi (seed/little.fruit-lk-
tree) ‘seed, little fruit of a tree’ is a term for ‘medicine’; wali-na:gw (white.man-sago) refers
to ‘biscuit’, and wali-gus (white.man-paddle) means ‘outboard motor’. Few people say kar for
‘car’—most prefer val ‘canoe’, and hardly anyone says umbrella—aba-ñ@g (head+lk-leaf) is
used instead. The term for a plane is mi val (high canoe); though many do switch to balus,
a Tok Pisin term. Telefon is in competition with mi ma:j (high talk). The term j @b ‘design,
drawing’ is also used for ‘letter, literacy’; its major competitor is English letter. And the
term taba-ñ@ (hand+lk-sun) is used in the meaning of ‘watch’ more than the English word
watch.
   Some new developments in the Manambu lexicon result in creating further patterns of
polysemy. An example of a newly evolving polysemy is kayik ‘image, picture, reﬂection (in
water), shadow, ghost’ (see §21.4), and nowadays also ‘photographs, pictures’ and ‘ﬁlms’.
(Examples 16.107 and 19.20 illustrate kayik in the sense of ‘photographs’.) A noun phrase
kayik v@-bana tami: (image see-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt area) can be understood as ‘area
where we see ﬁlms’, and ‘area where we see ghosts’. This is, of course, easy to disambiguate in
a context of real life. Another option, as we saw above, is to use a Tok Pisin or an English word
instead—neither ﬁlm nor piksa evoke any implications of ‘ghosts’.
   The noun ñ@g ‘leaf, mosquito net’, also used for ‘letter’ (but hardly ever for ‘book’), presents
a similar problem. We saw in 22.6 and 22.37 that it is in stiﬀ competition with Tok Pisin pas.
   As mentioned above, suku- means ‘carve, write, record (on a tape-recorder)’. This polysemy
posed unexpected problems for a ﬁeldworker as well as for the speakers, since it does not
allow one to easily distinguish between ‘writing’ and transcribing a story, and ‘recording it’.
The only way out appears to be a Tok Pisin code-switch (see §22.4.2 above). Another new
pattern of polysemy involves the verb v@- ‘see, look’ in the meaning of ‘read’ (see 21.13a, b). It
is diﬃcult to distinguish between ‘look at a book’ (as a child or an illiterate person would do),
and ‘read a book’—so Tok Pisin ridim ‘read’ comes to the rescue.","[636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645]"

652      TextsThe name Os@lo (phonetic variant: Osolo) is rather unusual in that it contains the sound o which is
highly marginal in Manambu (see §2.1.2). The two clauses are linked via juxtaposition; one constitutes a

The braces indicate the internal structure of a complex noun phrase (see §20.1.1). Repetition of the
complex verb g@pi-ya- (run-come) ‘run around’ in sequencing form was discussed at A in §12.8.3; this
denotes a repeated action. The verbs ‘run around’ in the sequencing form and in its inﬂected form
constitute one intonation unit; there is no intonation break or pause between them (which would be
indicative of a clause boundary).

The repetition of ‘run-go’ ‘run-come’ is an example of the ‘go-come’ construction discussed at A6 in

       this, I Oselo”, he then hit them’
Repetition of the verb of speech in the ﬁrst and second clauses is characteristic of colloquial speech
reports (see §19.5.6). In the third clause, time is cross-referenced in the second position (the knife is usually
masculine). In the fourth clause, an expressive referring to the sound of a knife cutting snakes is repeated
ﬁve times. The next ﬁve clauses consist of a sequencing form marked with -n and the reduced form na of
the numeral nak ‘one’ (see §10.6.1), in the meaning of ‘one another yet another etc.’. The form k@t@k@-n
is pronounced as k@t@-n following the intervocalic velar elision rule (§2.6). The next clause has the proper
name, Oselo, in the predicate slot (‘I am Oselo’). The subject of the imperative, ‘you’, appears in a focus
construction, since this is a very strong command, ‘don’t you (not anyone else) bite me’.

This example illustrates a lengthy clause chain where the change of subject is signalled by switch-
reference-sensitive markers. The form yi:n ‘go:rep+seq’ undergoes expressive lengthening iconically
reﬂecting the length of time of the action. This form can be interpreted either as referring to the actual
‘going’ or as meaning ‘on and on’—see §18.2. The inherently locational possessive construction ‘top of
real mosquito net’ (pronounced as one phonological word: §2.5) is not marked for locative case.

The adverb b@ ‘already’ is cliticized to the reactivated topic pronouns aka. The constituent in brackets is
an appositional noun phrase (see §20.1.1).

linked to the rest of the sentence via juxtaposition (see §19.7).

The second clause contains a diﬀerent-subject purposive. The change of subjects between the second and
the third clauses explains the diﬀerent subject on the ﬁrst clause (which is the same as that of the third,
fourth, and ﬁfth clauses). The third clause has causative overtones—this is the only idiomatic way of
expressing the idea of getting them to eat, or making them eat. The predicate of the last clause contains
an aspectual compound (§15.3.1) with durative meaning.

The ﬁrst clause contains a reactivated topic pronoun placed after the verb (see §20.2). The second clause
contains a speech report expressing the snake’s thoughts or internal speech. The predicates of the ﬁrst and
third clauses cross-reference time in the second position. The last clause consists of a negative pro-clause,
expressing the negative result—no children came out to welcome their mother.

(§19.7). The third clause in the speech report contains a negative construction where an adverb intervenes
between negation and the verb—see §14.1.

The ﬁrst clause is a negative pro-clause, negating the preceding T3.15. In the second clause, the reactivated
topic demonstrative is used to remind the speaker that this is a familiar participant—the little snake who
managed to escape Oselo and was the protagonist of T3.9. The next two clauses are part of the clause
chain (all marked for same subject) describing a sequence of actions by the little snake.

        said this, OK, (she went) on, “Oh, death adder, it is my children who already died!”, thus she
        cried’
The ﬁrst and the second clause describe the actions by the little snake (the verb ku- ‘put’ can only occur
with directionals—see §16.1.2). The predicate of the third clause is omitted (see §20.4.3). The next four
clauses form a speech report by the snake mother. In the ﬁrst clause in the speech report, the subject
(S) follows the imperative form of the verb (see §20.2). The third clause within the speech report is
juxtaposed to the fourth clause as a complementation strategy. The next speech report consists of two
juxtaposed clauses. Note the plural agreement on the verb ‘kill’: the snake mother is assuming that many
oﬀenders were involved in killing her children. The speech verb is followed by ya:kya ‘OK’, and yi:n
‘go+seq’ in its adverbial meaning ‘on and on’, and then another speech report framed by the verb ‘cry’.
The speech report contains two vocative forms—one of an argument, and the other of the predicate
(see §2.1.3).

        said)’
656      TextsT3.17 is linked to T3.16 via head-tail linkage (see §20.4.1). The speech report by the little snake is framed
with two occurrences of the speech verb wa- ‘speak’ (§19.5.1). In the second clause of the speech report,
the object, ‘you feminine’, appears without any case marking (see §7.2), as its function is clear from the
context. In the next clause, the name of the man is cross-referenced in the second position (with masculine
gender)—see Chapter 5.","[677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683]"
"   In addition, just as in the majority of the world’s languages, subjects are targets of impera-
tives, they control reﬂexives, and there is a ‘same-subject’ requirement in constructions involv-
ing the two modal verbs (20.25a–c and 20.58)—see Dixon (1994: 111–42). There are no other
pivot restrictions on coreferential deletion—as is to be expected in a language with switch-
reference.
   Given such robust grammatical criteria, there should not be any problem in identifying
subjects in each particular case. And yet there are. Body part constructions, copula clauses
referring to mental and physical states, and impersonal constructions are the cases in point. We
saw in §17.4, §18.3, and §20.1.1 (A) above that such constructions have two cross-referencing
patterns: the verb can either take third person feminine cross-referencing or it can cross-
reference the actual experiencer. Examples are at 20.31–5, and also in §17.4. The cross-
referencing depends on topicality: the experiencer is cross-referenced only if highly topical.
   And when used in a dependent clause, such constructions are marked for diﬀerent subjects
even if the subjects have the same referent. Examples like 20.62 may sound nonsensical: ‘they’
are hungry and the same ‘they’ will come—and yet, the subject is marked as ‘diﬀerent’.20.62 [ka:m yasa-l@-k]                     [ya-k-na-di]
      hunger be:feel-3fem.sg-compl.ds come-fut-act.foc-3plsubj.vt
      ‘If/when they feel hungry, they will come’ (lit. if/when hunger feels, they will come)This is in fact the most frequent situation—also see 18.24 and 20.36a. So, is a body part or the
noun referring to a bodily state the subject here? We return to this issue shortly.
   It should be noted that, as we saw in §18.3 (18.26), if the experiencer is topical, the situation is
diﬀerent. Then, the experiencer can be treated as ‘same subject’ with respect to switch-reference
even within a body part construction, if the subject is indeed the same. A rare example is at
20.37. Or if the subject is diﬀerent, it is marked as diﬀerent; but the experiencer remains cross-
referenced on the polyfunctional verb referring to a bodily state. An example is at 20.63.

      ‘After he’d felt hunger, she (mother) having gone to the previously mentioned place,
      having brought the sago she’d fried by carrying it gave it to him’
The man in 20.63 is the one who is hungry. Consequently, ‘he’ is cross-referenced with a
masculine singular marker on the polyfunctional copula verb yasa-, within a medial clause.
The subject of this clause is diﬀerent from that in the subsequent clause: the work is done by
one of his mothers. That is, diﬀerent-subject marking in 20.63 is sensible—it shows that one
person (man) was hungry and another person (woman) came, brought sago, and fed him.
   We can conclude that if the experiencer is cross-referenced and is topical it is the subject.
Otherwise it is not, even if it is overtly stated, because it does not trigger same-subject marking
or get cross-referenced on the verb. These constructions can also be considered impersonal.
This is plausible, given that third person singular cross-referencing is used in constructions
with no subject at all, such as sentences with modal verbs at 20.25a. Here, the body part or
the expression of bodily state such as ‘hunger’ cannot be considered the subject because it
behaves as a copula complement. A similar situation obtains with impersonal constructions
which include complex predicates such as suan yi- (diﬃcult go-) ‘be diﬃcult’ (see §4.1.2), and
a corresponding loan from Tok Pisin hat (used with the support verb t@-). In 20.64, 13.80, and
T3.33, the support verb yi- takes third person feminine cross-referencing. All these statements
have a generic meaning—one does not eat rotten bananas:
20.64 [bapi t@-dana]                               [suan    yi-k-na]
      rotten become-3plbas.vt+3fem.sgsubj.vt diﬃcult go-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [k@ka:k]
      consume+red+dat
      ‘If they (bananas) become rotten, it will be diﬃcult to eat (them)’
   An experiencer cannot be added—but an S can. And it can be expressed with a nominaliza-
tion as a complementation strategy, as in T3.20 and T3.33, or with a sequencing -n form:
20.65 [k@k@pa:t kur@-n] [k@                  tami: suan ya:l]
      food       get-seq dem.prox.fem.sg area diﬃcult go+3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘It was diﬃcult to get food in this area’
   A clause used as a complementation strategy can contain an object (ya:m ‘smell’ in T3.20
and k@k@pa:t ‘food’ in 20.65). But is the clause itself a subject? Presumably, yes—at least
based on formal reasons. First, the feminine singular cross-referencing on the verb is the
least functionally marked, and hence likely to be used in constructions with non-prototypical
subjects (see Aikhenvald 2000: 28–44).
   Secondly, as far as switch-reference-sensitive markers go, constructions like those in T3.20
and T3.33 are treated in the grammar as having diﬀerent subjects from that in the main clause,
even if the experiencer of the diﬃculty is the same as the subject of the adjacent clause. An
example is at T3.35: the predicate of the dependent clause is cross-referenced for diﬀerent
subject; and the snake is the main character and the subject of this whole sentence.
                                                                20.1 Major constituents       533  Another option is to cross-reference the experiencer on the verb—then the experiencer has
to be overtly stated, as in 20.66. The experiencer is highly topical: the hawk is stressing the
diﬃculty he has in entering the house without a key:
20.66 [wiya:r            wula-wula:k] [suan        yi-na-d@wun-@k]
      house+lk+all enter-red+dat diﬃcult go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
      ‘It is diﬃcult for me to enter the house’ (lit. I am diﬃcult to enter the house)
   Such a topical experiencer has yet another crucial subject property: it controls switch-
reference. In 20.67, the same person experienced diﬃculties in talking and got into the hands
of an evil man:
20.67 [wun yi-y@      suan     yi-ku]          [kuprap-@ du taba:r
      I      talk-red diﬃcult go-compl.ss bad-lk          man hand+lk+all
      wula-lwun-@k]
      enter-1fem.sgbas.p-conf
      ‘As it was diﬃcult for me to talk (lit. as I was diﬃcult to talk), I got into the hands of a
      bad man’
  Neither body part constructions, nor copula clauses or impersonal constructions, can form
imperatives or reﬂexives, or be used in constructions with modal verbs—which means that
these universal criteria for subjecthood are not applicable here.
  Bodily and mental processes in Papuan languages are very often expressed with ‘impersonal’
constructions, which are problematic with respect to their subjecthood. The title of Pawley, Gi,
Majnep, and Kias’s (2000) ‘Hunger acts on me . . . ’ speaks for itself: the problems we have
just addressed for Manambu are pervasive in the whole area—also see Pawley (forthcoming),
Roberts (2001), and Priestley (2002). Compared to other Papuan languages, body part and
impersonal constructions in Manambu are fairly limited. And the experiencer is never marked
as an object. There is also a strong correlation between the topicality of an experiencer and its
potential subjecthood.
  We conclude that in all such constructions in Manambu the topical participant has the
formal properties of a subject. This is congruent with the idea that subjects tend to be
grammaticalized topics (see, for instance, Keenan 1987: 103–4; and discussion in Dixon 1994:
11–30). It is interesting to note that subjecthood and topicality are closely intertwined just
in this instance, so much so that one is tempted to say that subjecthood in body part and
impersonal constructions is determined entirely by pragmatics.
  Verbless clauses are also potentially problematic in terms of how their subjects are to
be identiﬁed. Clauses with non-verbal predicates other than adverbial and reactivated topic
demonstratives are pretty straightforward in this respect: we recall, from §20.1.3 above, that
their subject is cross-referenced on the predicate itself with cross-referencing enclitics. When
used in dependent clauses, non-verbal predicates have to be used with a support verb which
then also cross-references the subject constituent.
  But verbless clauses and clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic demonstratives have no
subject cross-referencing. Neither can they be used in dependent clauses.
  Since the predicate is marked with the suﬃx -n- in both clauses with adverbial and reactivated
topic demonstratives (see 20.52b), the other obligatory constituent can be safely identiﬁed
with the subject. This other constituent—e.g. ‘food’ in 20.52b—triggers gender and number
agreement on the demonstrative in the predicate slot, which makes it similar to a subject
(A/S). The order of constituents is ﬁxed: the predicate always comes last. We thus conclude
that the non-predicate noun phrase in non-verbal clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic
534      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesdemonstratives as predicates is subject-like enough to be considered on a par with other
subjects.
   The situation in verbless clauses is less clear. In clauses of the naming type, there is semantic
agreement between the ﬁrst and the second noun phrase. The order is ﬁxed; and the choice
of the second NP depends on the ﬁrst. And if a ‘naming’ verbless clause is rephrased as a
non-verbal clause, the ‘name’ is in the predicate slot and the person named is the subject. This
allows us to hypothesize that the ‘name’ occupies the predicate slot, and the person named is
the subject.
   The same line of argument holds for verbless clauses with a reactivated topic demonstrative
in the second position—such as 20.52a. There is also some grammatical agreement between the
two constituents: so, in a verbless clause apawul ada (spirit dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg) ‘that
is a (masculine) spirit’ the masculine form is determined by the ﬁrst noun phrase. We can thus
suggest that the ﬁrst noun phrase is subject-like, and the second is not. Following the principles
of analogy with similar clauses, we can stipulate that the question word heads the predicate in
20.54, 10.98, 10.100–2. The situation with verbless clauses of other subtypes is just as murky:
the notion of subject does not appear to be applicable at all to the one-word clauses like those
in 20.53a and 20.55.
   The category of a syntactic subject—A and S—is highly relevant for Manambu (despite its
limited applicability to verbless clauses). What about other grammatical relations?
B. The category of object (O). We saw in §7.3 that the direct object (O) is often marked with
accusative case. An O can also be cross-referenced on the verb in the second position—see
§3.1—and it can be referred to with a reactivated topic demonstrative (§3.3 and §10.2.3). The
O is added to an intransitive verb as a result of applying the morphological causative kay- (see
§16.2.1). But while accusative marking is just about exclusive to a direct object, the other two
properties are not. In particular, any non-subject constituent—with the exception of speech
reports and copula complements—can be cross-referenced on the verb in the second position,
provided it is topical. Then, an ‘object’ is just a part of a more general category which can
be negatively deﬁned as ‘non-subject’. This ‘non-subject’ shares a number of properties with
S—the subject of an intransitive verb: see below.
C. Linking together S, O, and ‘non-subjects’. All or most languages of the world display a
number of links between S (= subject of an intransitive verb) and O (= object of a transitive
verb) (see Dixon 1994: 55; and Aikhenvald and Dixon forthcoming). These links have nothing
whatever to do with ergativity of any kind. They are expected to be found in languages
with every pattern of syntactic and morphological alignment—that is, nominative/accusative,
absolutive/ergative, and so on. So, if a language marks quantiﬁcation on verbs, it is highly likely
that the number expressed will be that of S or O. And this is indeed the case with the marker of
complete involvement -tu- (see §12.4), e.g. kiya-tu-di (die-many-3plbas.p) ‘TheyS all died’ and
vya-tu-di (kill-many-3plbas.p) ‘They killed (all) of themo (all over the place)’; and not ∗ They
(all) killed them’ (see 12.22–4 and 12.72).
   Besides this expected correlation between S and O, Manambu has a number of less obvious
ones. We saw in §3.3 and then in §10.2.3 that reactivated topic demonstratives can only refer to
an S, or an O, or, somewhat more rarely, to another non-subject participant—for instance,
recipient, location, and time. (That a demonstrative should operate on an absolutive basis
is hardly surprising—in Dyirbal and a few other languages, an NP including a nominal
demonstrative may only occur in S or O function which is the pivot function in Dyirbal: Dixon
2003: 83, 94–9.) These non-subject participants are the ones cross-referenced on the second
position—provided they are topical.
                                                                    20.2 Constituent order        535  This S/O, or, better, non-A, basis for reactivated topic markers has a pragmatic basis. It
agrees with a cross-linguistic tendency for a correlation between the non-A function (typically,
an S/O function) and introducing a new participant (Du Bois 1987). To put it simply: new
participants tend to be introduced in S/O function, but hardly ever in the A function.
  This principle in Manambu has interesting repercussions for the variations in constituent
order, and for the highlighting focus construction. There is a strong preference for non-As to
occur in a postverbal position reserved for unexpected and relatively new information and clar-
iﬁcation (see §20.2). An A constituent hardly ever occurs in highlighting focus constructions
reserved for new information (see §20.3). 20.2 c o n s t i t u e n t o r d e r: i t s s y n tac t i c a n d p rag m at i c m o t i vat i o n sConstituent order in Manambu is predominantly verb ﬁnal in main clauses, and almost exclu-
sively so in dependent clauses (see Tables 19.1 and 20.1). This is consistent with a verb-ﬁnal
tendency advocated as typical of languages with clause chaining and switch-reference.
   However, this is not a steadfast rule. One Sunday in early 2002 Ken Nayau, the major
consultant working with SIL missionaries Robin and Marva Farnsworth, was visiting his native
Avatip. He burst into Yuamali’s house where we were having a mid-afternoon snack to ask me
an urgent question: ‘What is a verb-ﬁnal order?’ I explained, using a mixture of Manambu,
Tok Pisin, and English, what this is supposed to mean (it is not an easy task to say ‘verb’ in
Manambu, or to talk about linguistics in general). ‘You put your verb at the end of what you
say.’ ‘Yes’, replied Ken, ‘this is what Robin told me it means. But we do not speak like that.’
   And indeed, not all clauses in Manambu end with a verb. (In the corpus, about 15–20
per cent do not.) There are a number of principles which allow for non-verb-ﬁnal orders in
the language.
   The general principle of ordering words and constituents in Manambu involves placing new
and less topically established participants ﬁrst. Participants tend to be introduced as O (as can
be seen in T1.1 and T2.1), or in a verbless clause (as in T1.3 which may be translated as ‘(There
was) a young man and a woman’), or as an S of a non-verbal clause (as in T2.3). In a transitive
clause, the order is typically AOV, as in 20.68a. An overt A does not have to be expressed at
all; but it is likelier to be expressed if the predicate is a non-inﬂecting verb as in 20.68a–b (also
see 7.5).20.68a wun m@n-a:m                vi      ma:
       I      you.masc-lk+acc/loc hit+neg neg
       ‘I will not hit you’  An OAV order implies that the O is contrastive, new, and unexpected, as in 20.68b:20.68b m@n-a:m                   wun vi         ma:
       you.masc-lk+acc/loc I           hit+neg neg
       ‘I will not hit you’ (implying that I may hit someone else)  Placing an O before an A is so unusual that if the clause is to be repeated in a ‘head-tail’
bridging structure (see §20.4), the A is also repeated. Note that the O is not case marked,
despite being a personal name: this O is a new participant never mentioned in the story again,
and case marking is associated with topicality—see §7.3.

      Avatip’  A conventional way of marking ‘head-tail’ bridging linkage would have been to say vya-
d@-d vya-d@-k (hit-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p hit-3masc.sg-compl.ds), literally, ‘he hit him,
having hit’ (see §20.4.1). But since there is potential ambiguity as to who did the hitting and
who was hit, ‘Iraman’ is repeated again.
  A fronted O in OAV clauses often appears in a highlighting focus construction:20.70 al@k        [klada                    ta:kw-a]O in focus      [d@ k@-d@

      we-lk-masc.sg child marry-impv.3p-masc.sg
      ‘That is why it is this woman down there (that) he this son of ours may marry’   Obliques also tend to be placed at the beginning of the clause if contrastive—see further
discussion in §20.3.
   The postverbal position is reserved for noun phrases, or sometimes parts thereof, which
provide unexpected supplementary information which is partly new and partly conﬁrms what
we already know. We saw in 20.20 that a numeral can be extracted from a noun phrase
postposed to the verb: in this case it emphasizes the ‘togetherness’ of the action.
   Only a small fraction of such postverbal elements are separated from the verb with a pause,
as one would have expected if it had been an afterthought. Consider 20.16: the woman did not
bring water even for her own child, and this latter, oblique constituent, is postposed to the verb,
as surprising information. This information is not fully new—we already know that the child
accompanied her, and that she did not bother to bring either food or water for either of them.
The postverbal position for the beneﬁciary, the child, stresses how remiss she was.
   Similarly, in 20.6, the speaker reintroduces his ancestor in S function as the one who was
looking around. A similar example is 13.56: the comitative ‘with them’ is supplied after the
verb because it is unexpected, and needs to be reiterated. In T1.16, the S is postposed to
the imperative form since it is conceived as a means of ‘chasing away’ an unexpected guest.
And in T2.16 the tree ﬁnally falls down—this unexpected and surpising result is expressed via
postposing the S to the verb. A similar example is at 20.71—a command by a mother to her
daughter urging her to be less greedy and share some of the tiny Malay apples with her baby
sister:20.71 l@-k@-k      akui                 mugul-a-jagw@s
      she-obl-dat impv+give.to.third.p three/few-lk-tiny.Malay.apple
      ‘Give her (guess what) a few tiny Malay apples!’ (something you do not expect to give
      her)
                                                                  20.2 Constituent order       537  A postverbal oblique often has a similar function, as in 10.3, 20.3 (‘to her’), and 20.72 (where
the postverbal noun phrase contains a relative clause). We already know where the mother and
her brother had gone; that the child decides to follow them right there is unexpected.
20.72 kwap@k ada                              ya:d               [amæy wa
      next.day dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go+3masc.sgbas.p mother and

      mother’s.brother go-3dubas.p+lk area+lk+dat
      ‘Next day he (child) went (guess where) to the area where mother and uncle had gone’
   As a result of this unexpected turn of events, the child discovers the existence of yams—
this is the beginning of the story about the origin of yams. A similar example is at T3.26—the
snake’s entering the house (postposed to the verb) is unexpected: snakes are not supposed to
enter houses.
   Alternatively, a postverbal NP may provide additional clariﬁcation, as in 20.8: the speaker
wanted to make sure the audience understands exactly who went up the river. A similar
example is at 20.73: the postverbal oblique makes it clear that the speaker is urging his sister to
return to the house:
20.73 s@b@n@n      yi-t@k         wiya:r
      return+seq go-1duimpv house+lk+all
      ‘Let’s go back, (that is) home’
  When a little boy got drowned in the village, the whole family was involved in mourning him;
20.74a speciﬁes that his mother was also among those who cried at that time:
20.74a [ata wuk@-ku]        [gra-dian    d@-k@            amæy wuk@n]
       then hear-compl.ss cry-1plbas.p he-obl+3fem.sg mother with
       ‘Then having heard (the news) we cried together with his mother’
   Similarly, in T2.59 the possessor in a non-verbal possessive clause is postposed to the
predicate, as a means of clariﬁcation. An NP which provides clariﬁcation is more likely to
be separated from the rest of the clause with a pause than an NP which supplies unexpected
information. An example of a clarifying afterthought is at T3.41.
   Not every syntactic function allows for a postverbal position with equal ease. The number
of transitive subjects in this position is remarkably limited. One such rare example is at 20.74b.
The participant sucking the breast was—according to the speaker—a rather unexpected one:
20.74b a                 ta:kw m@ñ ka:d                    a-d@        wa:j
       dem.dist.fem.sg woman breast eat+3masc.sgbas.p dem.dist-masc.sg eel
       ‘That eel (guess who!) was sucking that woman’s breast’
Another example is in the last clause of 16.29. This is an example of clariﬁcation stating exactly
which members of the opposite clan group (that is, the wife’s relatives) were conducting a
debate about the man’s mortuary festival.
   Two noun phrases can be postposed to the verb, albeit rarely. In 20.75a two NPs (an oblique
and an S) clarify a statement which would otherwise have appeared obscure. The adverb
‘already’ is also postposed to the verb—this emphasizes the unexpectedness of the fact that
the plane (and Jager with it) is already going away, in the direction of Wewak:
20.75a væki-na-d                           b@        Wewak-a:r          Jag@r
       go.across-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt already Wewak-lk+all Jager
       ‘Jager is already going across to Wewak!’ (lit. (He) is already (surprise!) going across to
       Wewak Jager)
538     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices   The English translation presents this clause as if it contained afterthoughts—the Manambu
clause does not, because there are no pauses intervening between the constituents.
   A rare example of VOA order is at 20.75b: that I (the addressee) had not yet had the chance
to go to the market and see Walinum (‘her’) again was surprising to the speaker:
20.75b ma: n@bay v@          l@-k@-m             ñ@n
       neg yet     see+neg she-obl-acc/loc you.fem
       ‘You (not anyone else: surprise) haven’t yet seen (guess who) her’
  An unusual constituent order, such as OVAO in 20.76, tends to involve repetition of one of
the constituents. In 20.76, bal ‘pig’ (O) is repeated twice: once before and once after the verb:
20.76 [abra                  {war-b@r]        [war-ku]}       [balO
      dem.dist.react.top+du go.up-3dubas.p go.up-compl.ss pig
      ada                         vya-bra-d]                    [amæy asa:y]A
      dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg kill-3dusubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p mother father
      [p@takaum kwa-d-@                   bal]O
      ladder+loc stay-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk pig
      ‘The two went up, having gone up; killed the pig mother (and) father the pig that was
      on the ladder’
  The second postposed constituent can be an afterthought, as in 20.77. It is separated from
the rest of the clause by a pause:
20.77 [a-d@             wi     ada                          yi:n
      dem.dist-masc.sg house dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go+seq
      s@maka-yi-d@-d                         du-a-ñan]     pause [a-di        rum-a:b]
      show-go-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p man-lk-child pause dem.dist-pl room-too
      ‘The boy (guess who) kept on showing that house on and on, those rooms too’
   Speakers vary as to the frequency of postposed NPs and adverbs. Postposition for clariﬁ-
cation purposes is more frequent with older women as story tellers, accustomed to explaining
and spelling out things for their grandchildren as their audience. During my ﬁrst stay at Avatip,
speakers such as Yipawal, Yuawalup, and the late Wimali would use such postposed noun
phrases (S, O, obliques, and even As) with much more frequency than later on, after I’d become
much less of a novice (or a novelty), and was expected to understand a story like any other
adult.
   Postposing an NP to the verb in a command may have additional repercussions to do with
its illocutionary force. This is shown in the three contrasting examples below. In 20.78a, the
mother tells the elder child to give a doll to a younger child who is crying:
20.78a dolly nak l@-k@-k     akui
       dolly one she-obl-dat impv+give.to.third.p
       ‘Give her one dolly!’
  The elder girl ignores the command, and the younger child continues crying. The mother,
mildly annoyed, repeats the command as 20.78b:
20.78b dolly nak akui                     l@-k@-k
       dolly one impv+give.to.third.p she-obl-dat
       ‘Give her one dolly’ (lit. one dolly give to her)
  The girl ignores it again, and the younger child cries more and more. The mother shouts:
                                                                  20.2 Constituent order        53920.78c akui                   pause dolly nak l@-k@-k
       impv+give.to.third.p pause dolly one she-obl-dat
       ‘Give her one dolly!!!’ (Give (pause) one dolly to her)
  In this last example, the noun phrases are separated from the verb with a short pause.
However, it appears counterintuitive to treat them as ‘afterthoughts’—rather, the mother sets
the NPs oﬀ from the verb as a way of reminding the naughty girl what she is to do, unless she
wants to face the consequences. (The child did not, and opted to run away.)
  Order within dependent clauses tends to be verb ﬁnal. However, there are exceptions—as in
T1.3, and 20.79. These exceptions serve a didactic purpose—that of reminding the audience of
an S, or an O, or an oblique (but hardly ever an A). The man was mentioned a few lines before;
so the speaker chose to repeat a reference to him, just in case:
20.79 [v@-k@tak@p t@-ku              du-a:k]         [adiya          s@b@nadi]
      see-fr       ‘stand’-compl.ss man-lk+dat dem.dist.react.top+pl return+3plbas.p
      ‘Having tried to see the man in vain, they returned’
There is never any pause between the predicate of the dependent clause and the postposed NP.
   A dependent clause can be postposed to the main clause, as a means of providing supplemen-
tary information, as in 14.115, 14.116, and T1.34. This information is not new—the function of
a postposed dependent clause is to remind the listener of something they are already supposed
to know. Consider T1.34: all the postposed medial completive clause tells us is that the main
character was married—something we have known from the very start of the story.
   A similar example is at 20.80. The girl is very angry with her uncle who had mistreated her
in the past. This is what the preceding paragraph is about. The uncle understands this and says
to the girl’s brother (for whom the fact that the girl is angry is also no news):
20.80 [l@ [l@-k@             s@    kwa:l-a                 tamiya:b] kwa:l
      she she-obl+fem.sg sleep stay+3fem.sgbas.p-lk area+lk+term stay+3fem.sgbas.p
      aka]                         [wun-a:k warsama-ku]
      dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg I-lk+dat be.angry-compl.ss
      ‘She is in the place where she sleeps, having got angry at me’
   A dependent medial clause postposed to the main clause with same-subject marking may
have a recapitulative function. Then they form one intonation unit. Examples are in 18.19 and
18.28, 20.76, T2.23, and the penultimate clause of T2.40. We saw, in §19.5, that such recapit-
ulating constructions are particularly frequent in speech reports, as in 19.74. An additional
function of this is to stress that a speech act actually took place: speech report constructions
in Manambu are used in a wide variety of meanings not all of which involve a speech act.
Alternatively, the same-subject form of the verb t@- ‘stand, be’ can be used in the meaning of
‘after that’, literally, ‘having been (like that)’, as in 18.24 and 18.28, and T2.62.
   We saw in §13.7, and especially examples such as 13.79–81 and 20.64, that a dative-aversive
marked nominalization can precede or follow the main (inﬂected) verb. A postverbal position
is reserved for an unexpected piece of information, as in 13.82 (people are normally not afraid
of going into a house).
   The position of the reactivated topic demonstrative aka (dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg) before
or after the verb depends on what the demonstrative refers to. If it refers to a participant
(typically in S, O or oblique function), it precedes the verb, as in 10.41 and T2.1. If it refers to
the action itself, it can be placed either before or after the verb.
   It appears after the verb if the whole action and its extent is somewhat unexpected. Consider
the ﬁnal lines of the three texts: in T2.69, aka precedes the verb, and in T1.35 and T3.53 it
540      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesfollows. In the latter instances, the end of a story is stated as being ‘that topical one’: neither
story is a traditional one, and consequently does not have an ending that everyone would be
aware of. In contrast, T2.69 is the ending of a traditional story which ﬁnishes in due course;
and so aka precedes the verb. Along similar lines, in the ﬁrst clause in 20.80 the fact that the
girl is sleeping in her house and her uncle is left outside is somewhat unexpected and contrary
to convention—this explains the postverbal position of aka.
   In summary: constituent order in Manambu is both syntactically and pragmatically based.
In particular, the fact that A (transitive subject) hardly ever appears postposed to the verb
reﬂects its pragmatic function closely associated with its syntactic role.
   We will see, in §20.4.1 (example 20.90) that having a non-verb-ﬁnal constituent order does
not aﬀect the basics of ‘head-tail’ linkage between sentences.
                    20.3 highlighting fo cus constructionsHighlighting focus constructions (mentioned in §3.1 and then in §11.1.1, and example 11.8)
involve marking a noun phrase or a fully inﬂected verb as if it were a non-verbal predicate,
in order to contrast it with another constituent, or another clause. A noun phrase or a
verbal form in highlighting focus takes nominal cross-referencing enclitics. Gender and number
speciﬁcations agree with the head of predicate. That is, if the predicate head is masculine
singular, as in the ﬁrst clause in 20.81, cross-referencing is masculine singular. And if the
predicate head is feminine singular, so is the cross-referencing, as in the second clause in
20.81. If the whole inﬂected verb is in highlighting focus (examples 20.87–8), the agreement
is third person feminine singular; this is in line with this being the least functionally marked
choice. Highlighting focus constructions are highly frequent in conversations and narratives.
They involve contrasting a constituent to another constituent; or ‘stressing’ a constituent as
important for the discourse.
   As mentioned in §20.1.1, parts of a noun phrase cannot be focused independently: only an
NP as a whole can. The same principle applies to complex predicates. A clause cannot contain
two constituents each in a focus construction. A constituent in focus tends to occupy a clause-
initial position.
   A highlighting focus construction does not appear to produce a cleft sentence: the non-
focused part of the clause has the make-up of an independent clause. We would expect a cleft
to split a clause into two clauses: one copula-like, and the other marked as a relative clause (see
Matthews 1997). We return to this issue further below.
   There is no intonation break or pause between the form in highlighting focus, which has to
obligatorily precede the predicate. A story or a conversation never starts with a highlighting
focus simply because a highlighting focus implies contrast to something previously mentioned.
A constituent in highlighting focus does not have to be deﬁnite; but it has to have been
mentioned previously in discourse.
   Highlighting focus overwhelmingly involves S (intransitive subject), as in T1.3, T1.13,
penultimate clause of T3.16, T3.25, and 20.81, or the object, as in T2.59, T3.3, and 20.82.
Constituents in highlighting focus are in braces, and so are their translations into English:20.81 [{j@pwas-ad}               t@k@r-@m     r@-kwa-na-d]

       stool’ (lit. {It is an initiated man} used to sit on a stool,{it is a woman} there is no
       sitting on a stool)
  An object in highlighting focus construction is never case marked. This is in line with
the semantics of object case marking (see §7.3): only deﬁnite and topical, rather than focal,
objects are case marked. This also agrees with a general tendency of not having case-marked
constituents in the highlighting focus constructions.
20.82 {du d@-k@-d@           kui-ad}      k@-da-d
      man he-obl-masc.sg meat-3masc.sgnom eat-3plsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘{It is man’s ﬂesh} they ate’
  The S of a non-verbal clause can be in highlighting focus, as in T1.7 (‘as for this one’), T2.27
(ka ‘this is it (that I am)’), T3.40 (kad b@ numa-d@ ga:n-ad ‘this is that it is a big masculine
night’) and 20.83.

      dem.dist-masc.sg spirit-3masc.sgnom snake-3masc.sgnom
      ‘{It is that spirit} (who) is a snake’ (lit. {It is a spirit} is a snake)
So can a time adverb as in T3.42 (‘today’), and an addressee, as in 20.84.
20.84 {a-d@               Kainu-ad}              wa-ñ@na-d
      dem.dist-masc.sg Kainu-3masc.sgnom say-2fem.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘{It is that Kainu} (that) you spoke to’ (lit. {it is that Kainu} you spoke to)
If a location or an instrument is focused, it tends to appear without any case marking, as in
20.85a (this is also a possible alternative interpretation for the ﬁrst clause of T2.8). A rare
example of a case-marked oblique in highlighting focus is at 20.85b.
20.85a {gu-a}               ya-b@r
       water-3fem.sgnom come-3dubas.p
       ‘{It is to water} (that) they came’

       house+lk+all-3fem.sgnom go-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘{It is to the house} (that) they went’
   We mentioned in §10.2.2 that ata ‘thus’ has a predicative focus form ata-n, e.g. ata-n au (thus-
pred impv+talk) ‘speak now’ (lit. ‘it is now that you are commanded to speak’). This marker
also appears when ata heads the predicate (see §20.1.3). An example of ata in a highlighting
focus construction is at 20.86 (the O, ‘ceremony’, is postposed to the verb as a clariﬁcation).
20.86 {ata-n-adi}         t@-da-di              ba:gw
      thus-pred-3plnom have-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p ceremony
      ‘{This was the way} they had ceremonies’ (lit. {Thus was} they had (what we already
      know, that is) ceremonies)
  A constituent within a dependent clause can rarely occur in a highlighting focus construction
unless there is a break (a rare example is at T2.35). A dependent clause (except for an -n-marked
sequential clause) cannot be in highlighting focus.
542     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices   We saw, at §20.1.3 above, that the interrogative pronoun s@ ‘who’ is obligatorily marked for
focus if it occurs in subject function. This is the only instance of grammaticalized focus whose
occurrence is limited to S and A.
   Highlighting focus constructions involving arguments and obliques cannot be negated sep-
arately. This is hardly surprising: we can recall that a constituent cannot be negated separately,
without the whole clause being negated.
   We now turn to a rather unusual construction whose function is to contrast an action, or
a state, to other actions or states. Such ‘predicate focus’ constructions involve marking a fully
inﬂected verb as if it were a non-verbal predicate. Note that they cannot involve a predicate
already marked for action focus (§12.2). (If the predicate in ‘predicate focus’ contains an
uninﬂected verb, it requires a support verb—see §17.2.) In 20.87, the speaker is saying that
what they were going to do was to cut the pig, and not anything else. This is framed as predicate
focus—that is, the whole clause is within the scope of the focus. A similar example is at 11.8.
20.87 [au {k@-d@                 bal ra-k@-bana-l}-a]
      then dem.prox-masc.sg pig cut-fut-1plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
      ‘It is that {we are going to cut the pig}’ (rather than doing something else)
  ‘Predicate focus’ structures produced spontaneously often provide an explanation for an
unusual event or state. When we returned to Avatip from an exhausting trip to Swakap, people
would look askance at my bandaged arms. The answer—provided by Yuaneng—was:
20.88 [{Swakapa:r         yi-ba-l}-a]
      Swakap+lk+all go-1plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
      ‘It is that {we went to Swakap}’ (and got sunburnt and tired)
   A distal demonstrative as head of non-verbal predicate can be put in a focus construction,
as a form of a strong statement: a-l-al (dem.dist.fem.sg-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom) ‘this is it’.
It is also used as a conversation sustainer, and as a summarizing statement indicating that the
speaker has ﬁnished one point, and may well start on something else.
   Such predicate focus constructions cannot contain reactivated topic demonstratives. Neither
do they occur with a non-predicate-ﬁnal constituent order. This is to do with their pragmatic
organization: the event or the resulting state is viewed as a whole, and is thus contrasted to
another event, the participants being of secondary importance.
   The diﬀerence between the English translational equivalents in 20.87–8 and 11.8 and the
Manambu structures is that there is no overt subordination marker in Manambu.
   If the predicate in a highlighting focus construction is negated, it takes the subordinate
negator -ma:r-. We can recall, from §14.5.3, that this is indeed the most frequent context under
which a predicate of what looks like an independent clause may occur with -ma:r-. This involves
focusing a negated clause. Examples are at 14.134–5, and 20.89a. What makes life in Swakap
unbearable for the people from Avatip and Malu is that:
20.89a [{kwasa          wi    t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]
       small+fem.sg house have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
       ‘It is that {they do not have toilet (small house)}’
   This brings us back to the issue of whether highlighting focus involves a cleft or not. In
many languages, focus constructions are expressed via cleft clauses which, in their turn, involve
marking part of a clause as a dependent clause. That a dependent clause negator is used
in focused clauses shows that such clauses may be considered underlyingly dependent. That
is, at least predicate focus constructions may be considered clefted, but the evidence only
                                            20.4 Further issues in discourse organization       543becomes apparent if they are negated. And this should not come as a surpise—it is also the
case in relative and juxtaposed dependent clauses whose status as dependent clauses is fully
revealed under negation. Highlighting focus constructions do not involve relative clauses (see
§19.2): the rearrangement of participants typical for possessor relative clauses does not occur
in highlighting focus constructions.
   If a constituent in highlighting focus is contrastive, an option is to employ double focus. This
involves adding another nominal cross-referencing marker, as in 20.89b. Here, the fact that they
do not have a toilet is contrasted to the fact that other, more ‘cultured’ people do:20.89b [{kwasa          wi
       small+fem.sg house
       t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]-al
       have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
       ‘It is that {they do not really have toilet (small house)}’   The existence of double focus structures demonstrates that focus constructions are diﬀerent
from verbless clauses with non-verbal predicate heads: no non-verbal predicate would take
double cross-referencing, outside the focus construction. Unlike 20.60, where a double focus
structure is obligatory, in 20.89b it is pragmatically determined.
   Are highlighting focus constructions monoclausal or biclausal? The evidence goes both
ways. A noun phrase in highlighting focus has the appearance of a full verbless clause, since
it includes non-verbal cross-referencing markers. On the other hand, it is not a full clause
because it cannot be negated separately. It occupies the argument slot of the predicate. And
if it is to be questioned, the question word also has to be cast as a focused constituent.
We conclude that highlighting focus constructions combine features of biclausal and mono-
clausal constructions, and, just like transitivity-neutralizing constructions involving clause
chaining (§17.5), are an additional instance of grammar-in-the-making. A similar construction
in Iatmul was described by Jendraschek (2006b): their status as bi- or monoclausal is equally
ambiguous.
               20.4 f u rt h e r i s s u e s i n d i s c o u r s e o rga n i zat i o nManambu clauses form sentences which contain one main clause, and sentences combine to
form a paragraph. A paragraph—or a coherent stretch of discourse—is deﬁned as having a
topic of its own, and is normally separated from the next paragraph by a signiﬁcant pause.
As we saw above, a topic usually appears preposed to the predicate. A reactivated topic—
that is, a topic mentioned in a previous stretch of discourse and known to the speaker
and to the addressee, but not mentioned for some time—is marked with reactivated topic
demonstratives (see §10.2.3 and §3.3). This is a powerful device which allows speakers to
handle more than one topic at a time. The ways sentences can be linked together within a
paragraph, or across paragraphs, are addressed in §20.4.1. In §20.4.2 we discuss the function
of ‘boundary-marking’ clauses consisting of ya:kya ‘all right’ and its Tok Pisin equivalent orait
(§20.4.2).
   We saw in §20.2 above that constituent order plays its role in identiﬁcation of topical partic-
ipants. Narratives tend to be elaborate in stating participants, while conversational discourse
is highly elliptical, and heavily relies on context. Some of the recurrent principles of ellipsis in
the Manambu discourse are discussed in §20.4.3.
544      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices   A typical turn-taking device is the ﬁrst person permissive form of the verb wa- ‘speak’: wau
‘May I speak? Shall I speak now?’ A distal demonstrative as head of non-verbal predicate in a
focus construction a-l-al (dem.dist.fem.sg-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom) ‘this is it’ signals the end
of what someone has to say, indicating that at least one point is ﬁnished, just like a verbless
clause akatawa ‘this is how it is’ (see 20.53a).
   Expressions like a-l-al and the interjection ay are used as conversation sustainers, supplying
feedback from the listener and urging the speaker to go on talking. The expression ma:j ma:
(speech neg) ‘there is nothing to say; talk is over’ (very similar to Tok Pisin nogat tok) is a
signal that there is nothing much else to add to the conversation.","[558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571]"

            12.8.1 Derivational suﬃxes -r@b ‘fully’ and -d@ka ‘only’ on verbsVerb roots carrying one of the two derivational suﬃxes, -r@b ‘fully’ and -d@ka ‘only’, are
uninﬂected (see Table 11.1). They diﬀer from all other uninﬂected predicates in two ways.
First, they cannot be used as copula complements. Secondly, they often form one constituent
with an inﬂected form of the same verb root. The two derivational suﬃxes cannot co-occur in
one predicate. Neither can they co-occur with any of the aspectual, conﬁrmation, or modality
markers discussed here, or in Chapter 13.
                                         12.8 Intensive, continuous, and repeated actions       265I. An uninﬂected verb marked with the derivational suﬃx -r@b ‘fully’ can head a predicate, as
in 12.40–1:
12.40 [n@k@r-@-k m@y-a kiya-r@b]
      cold-lk-dat real-lk die-fully
      ‘(I) really fully died of cold’
  Example 12.41 was the way little Stevie described the light colours on a colour chart which
for him were subsumed under ‘very white’:
12.41 wama-ka-wa:m-adi,              akatawa yi-r@b
      white+lk-der-white-3plnom thus           go-fully
      ‘They are very white, all the way going this way’
  As mentioned above, a verb root marked with -r@b often forms one constituent with an
inﬂected form of the same verb root. No constituent except for the connective ata ‘then’ and a
reactivated topic pronoun can intervene between the inﬂected and the uninﬂected components
of a predicate. This justiﬁes treating constructions consisting of -r@b and an inﬂected verb as
complex predicates. The meaning is intensive, ‘fully, straight away’, as in 12.42, with a transitive
verb, and 12.43, with an intransitive one.
12.42 wapa-r@b wapa-tu@-l                         wun-a-k@      yawi
      leave-fully leave-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p I-lk-poss+fem.sg job
      ‘I left my welfare job fully straight away’
12.43 gra-r@b    ata gra:l
      cry-fully then cry+3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Then she cried strongly straight away’
In 12.44, the suppletive imperative form of the verb ‘go’ appears as the inﬂected component
accompanying the uninﬂected form marked with -r@b:
12.44 yi-r@b    ma:y
      go-fully go.impv
      ‘Go straight away!’
   The order of components is ﬁxed. It can only be reversed, if the root + -r@b form is an
afterthought separated from the main clause with a pause, as in 12.45. A normal constituent
order is in 12.46.
12.45 kiya-k-na-ñ@n                      [pause] kiya-r@b
      die-fut-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt pause die-fully
      ‘You will die, die straight oﬀ (if you come near the door and fall out of the house)’
12.46 kiya-r@b kiya-k-na
      die-fully die-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She will die straight oﬀ (if she falls out of the window)
We can recall, from §9.2 and Table 9.2, that -r@b also occurs on nouns and adjectives, with
similar meanings. Constructions consisting of verb root + -r@b and followed by an inﬂected
form of the same verb are unique to verbs—there is no similar structure for nouns or adjectives.
II. A verb marked with the derivational suﬃx -d@ka ‘only’ means ‘do only and non-stop’, e.g.
bla-d@ka ‘talk non-stop’. A verb marked with -d@ka can be repeated to express continuous
266     12 Verbal Categoriesand persistent activity, e.g. paku ‘hide’, paku-d@ka paku-d@ka ‘hide continuosly’, bla-d@ka bla-
d@ka ‘talk continuously’, væt@-d@ka væt@-d@ka ‘bite continuously’, wasupu-d@ka wasupu-d@ka
‘gossip non-stop, do nothing but gossip’. Such repeated forms can head the predicate, as in
12.47.
12.47 akatawa yak@-d@ka yak@-d@ka yawa                 kamnag@wa
      thus     throw-only throw-only ﬁre+lk+com food+lk+com
      ‘Thus (he was) just throwing and throwing, food into ﬁre’
  The uninﬂected verb marked with -d@ka can be repeated more than once, if the action was
taking place over an extended period of time. This is a special property of the suﬃx.
12.48 [d@y-adi       væse-n adiya                      t@-na-di]              t@-d@ka

      then make.noise-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘As for them, they went on walking, only went on, only went on, only went on, only went
      on, after the afternoon fell on them, a storm sounded’
  Alternatively, one or two occurrences of a verb marked with -d@ka can be accompanied by
an inﬂected form of the same root, to express persistence and continuity of an activity, as in
12.49–50:
12.49 suku-d@ka suku-d@ka suku-na-wun
      write-only write-only write-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
      ‘I am writing, writing, writing only’
   This is somewhat similar to the constructions with a verb marked with -r@b and followed by
an inﬂected form of the same verb, illustrated in 12.42. The diﬀerence is that the verb itself,
marked with -r@b, is not repeated, while the verb marked with -d@ka is.
   The order of components in V+-d@ka constructions is ﬁxed, and no constituent can inter-
vene between components. The meaning is that of increased intensity. So, Israel, with its current
political situation of constant ﬁghting, was referred to as 12.50. Many Manambu people
strongly believe that they are descendants of one of the tribes of Israel; consequently they
have very pronounced feelings in support of this country.
12.50 warya-d@ka warya-kwa-dana-d@                       t@p
      ﬁght-only ﬁght-hab-3plsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt village
      ‘a place where one does nothing but ﬁghting all the time’
  In 12.51, a similar construction expresses a strong prohibition:
12.51 g@ñ@r ya-d@ka      ya-k-wayik!
      later come-only come-ep-proh.strong
      ‘Later do not you dare come any more!’
   A form marked with suﬃx -d@ka can be used as the predicate of a subordinate clause, as in
12.52. Here, it is used on the generic completive verb napa- (§18.9) used exclusively in medial
clauses:
12.52 [gu     yaku-n napa-d@ka]        da-k-na-wun
      water wash-seq do.after-only go.down-fut-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
      ‘I will go down only after I have washed’
                                        12.8 Intensive, continuous, and repeated actions    267  Examples like 12.51 and 12.44 show that the meanings conveyed by the suﬃxes -r@b ‘fully’
and -d@ka ‘only’ are not incompatible with imperatives and prohibitives. We saw in 12.34 that
the customary aspect can also occur in commands and prohibitions.
  This is in contrast to the completive and the habitual aspect, which cannot occur in com-
mands. However, positive and negative commands with a habitual meaning can be expressed
through using the customary aspect (as in 12.34). That is, an apparent gap in the paradigm of
the habitual aspect can be said to be ﬁlled through using another form. This is in contrast to
the completive aspect which cannot be used in commands.","[291, 292, 293, 294]"
" 3 A full list of clans and their totems is outside the scope of this grammar (and is a matter of contention among the
Manambu speakers themselves).
76     4 Word Classes   Address terms can be gender sensitive; for instance yab@n, yaban is a term of address for men
of the Maliau clan, and yab@nay is its correspondent for women. The form yab@nay is also a
name for the Iatmul clans which are totemically the same as the Maliau clan; this term has no
other meaning in Manambu. The same address term can be used for men and for women: for
instance, tapwuk ‘chicken’, gawi ‘eagle’, and wud@b ‘spirit’ can be used to address both men
and women from the Nabul clan.
   Address forms are illustrated in 4.5–6. In 4.5 a cassowary (who has shed her skin and become
a beautiful young woman) is addressed in the way appropriate for a member of the Sarak clan,
to which she belongs, since the cassowary is its totem. This is said by a man who has just stolen
and hidden her skin, and is going to marry the cassowary-woman.4.5 mæy-a           Apwi              Manab ñ@n-a           s@p

    k@ka
    dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg
    ‘Come, the one of Sarak clan, your skin is here’  In 4.6, two diﬀerent address forms are used to one person. The more address forms one
knows and uses, the more elaborate one is as a speaker, and the addressee is likelier to listen to
what one has to say.4.6 a-kamal         ya    akr@l    Yaban

    go-fut-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt-conf come.impv-voc address:maliau
    ‘Do come back, where are you going, Yaban (the one of the Maliau clan), come, Jamal’  The address forms such as the ones shown in 4.5–6 can be used as vocatives. They can also
be heads of intransitive predicates and copula complements: to say that someone is of the
Vali:k clan, one can say: kanukaraki-a (death.adder-3fem.sgnom) ‘she is (to be addressed as)
“death adder” (a totem of the Vali:k clan)’. They are not used in any other function, and can
be considered a marginal subclass of nominals, restricted in their morphological and syntactic
possibilities.
  The general ‘goodwill’ address term k@ p, plural k@pugw ‘my dear’ stands apart from all
other address terms. It is used exclusively as a term of address in farewells, greetings, and
expressions of best wishes, and is noun-like only in the way the plural is derived (see §6.1). It
can be considered a defective noun (see §21.2.2). (Since it cannot be modiﬁed, or used as an
argument, its gender is impossible to establish: see §5.2.)
  Deverbal action nominalizations are derived via CV/CCV and CVCV reduplication of the
verbal root (the choice depends on the root structure; further discussion of nominalizations,
their argument structure and meanings is in §§9.1.1–2). They can occur in the S function, as in
4.7 (‘be diﬃcult’) and 4.8 (‘ﬁnish’).4.7 d@-k@-m            kawar-kawar suan       yi-na

They are used as complementation strategies—see §19.8. Unlike other nouns, but just like
verbs, nominalizations can be modiﬁed by nouns in local cases, e.g. t@p-a kudir nas-@-nas
(village-lk language+all count-lk-count) ‘counting in the village language’, but not by adjec-
tives. A nominalization can modify a noun, e.g. tabu-tabu wa:l (escape-red rain) ‘a passing
rain, lit. a rain running away’. Nominalizations do not take any verbal morphology.
   A subclass of nominals can occur only as copula complements, e.g. bwiyabwi ‘heat’ (copula
na-) and suan ‘diﬃculty’ (copula yi-). These also include terms for weather and times of day,
e.g. kat@lam ‘dawn’, and onomatopoeia, e.g. rou rou rou ‘growling sound’ (both occur with the
copula na-). Unlike other nouns (except for the address term k@ p) the gender of these nominals
is impossible to establish, since they cannot be heads of NPs or arguments other than copula
complements.
   They cannot take any nominal (or other) morphological markers. Just a few can be used as
modiﬁers. For instance, the form s@pis@pi ‘drizzle, drizzly’ typically occurs with a copula na-,
as in s@pis@pi na-k-na (drizzle be:nat-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘it will drizzle’. It can also
be used as a modiﬁer to the only noun with which it is semantically compatible: s@pis@pi wa:l
(drizzle rain) ‘drizzling rain’, and as a modiﬁer to a verb, as in wa:l s@pis@pi væker-na (rain
drizzle fall-act.foc+3fem.sgbas) ‘the rain is falling in a drizzly way’.
   This is a potentially open class, since it comprises loans like bisi ‘busy’, isi ‘easy’, stati ‘start’,
save ‘know, knowledge’ (from Tok Pisin bisi, isi, stati, and save) or les ‘lazy, unwilling’ (from
Tok Pisin les). These always occur as copula complements, with a copula/support verb yi-
or t@- (see §17.2.2), e.g. stati t@-na-wun (start ‘stand’-act.foc-1sgbas.vt) ‘I start’, ma: save
t@ (neg know ‘stand’:neg) ‘(I/you/she/he, etc.) don’t know’, and 22.35. They never occur as
verbs, despite the fact that, as we will see in §4.2, Manambu is not averse to borrowing
verbs.
   Nouns of physical states are similar: they typically occur as copula complements, with
polyfunctional verbs (see §4.2.2 and §17.2), e.g. ka:m ‘hunger’ (copula yasa-/yas@-), n@k@r ‘cold’
(copula tay-). However, most of them can also take the dative case, be heads of possessive con-
structions, and occur with derivational suﬃxes, e.g. sad@ka (sleep+only) ‘(process of sleeping)
only’. A few can occur with more than one polyfunctional verb with a meaning diﬀerence, e.g.
s@ ‘sleep’ with the copula yasa-/yas@- means ‘be sleepy’, and with the copula kwa- means ‘sleep,
be asleep’. These nouns can be assigned variable gender depending on the ‘degree’ of quality
they express (masculine gender goes with a stronger degree, and feminine gender with a weaker
degree—see §5.2).
   A number of deverbal aspectual forms (e.g. -j@b@r ‘customary aspect’: §12.7) and modal
forms (e.g. desiderative -k@r (§13.5) and frustrative -p and -(ya)k@ p (§13.6) ) appear to be more
nominal than verbal. First, they do not take any verbal cross-referencing or verbal sequencing
suﬃxes. Secondly, to express tense, or to be used in a non-main clause, these forms have to
occur as complements of the support verb t@- ‘be, stand’, as illustrated in 4.9.4.9 v@-k@ta-k@p t@-k-na-d
    see-try-fr be/stand-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
    ‘He will be trying to see in vain’4.10 ga:m ata s@-na                           s@-p    s@-p     s@-p   t@-ku
     call then put-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt put-fr put-fr put-fr be/stand-compl.ss
     ‘She called, having then called many times in vain (she stepped and went up onto the dry
     land)’
78     4 Word Classes  These forms do not have any nominal grammatical categories, and cannot occur in any
syntactic function other than a copula complement. Since they express essentially verbal
categories and have verbal argument structure, we will consider them in the chapters dealing
with verbal morphology (Chapters 11–13).
                                          4.2 v e r b s                           4.2.1 Verbal grammatical categoriesVerbs are an open class. They constitute the most complicated part of the Manambu grammar,
from the point of view of both the richness of grammatical categories, and of morphophono-
logical complexity. That verbs are an open class is corroborated by the facility Manambu
appears to have in adopting verbs as loans. We saw in §4.1.2 that verb roots are often borrowed
as nominals, and then used as copula complements. Verbal roots can also be borrowed as
verbs, and then take all the appropriate verbal morphology. It is hard to determine whether
these are established loans, or occasional nonce loans, e.g. a-pas (impv-tie) ‘tie!’, pasi-tua ‘I
tied’ (from Tok Pisin pasim ‘tie’), a-tik (impv-tick) ‘tick!’ Whether to borrow a verb as a
verb, or as a nominal employed as a copula complement of the verb t@-, is often speaker’s
choice (see Aikhenvald forthcoming c). The Tok Pisin verb kamap ‘take place, occur, get up’
is frequently used as a full verb in Manambu, e.g. kamap@-d ‘he got up, (it) happened’. The
same root can be borrowed as a copula complement of the verb t@-, as in kamap@ ta:d (get.up
‘stand’+3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘He got up (became ﬁne)’. Loan verbs integrated into the language
and used by most speakers include sali- ‘send’ (Tok Pisin salim), laiki- ‘like’ (Tok Pisin laikim),
puti- ‘put’ (Tok Pisin putim), paini- ‘ﬁnd’ (Tok Pisin painim), and lukauti- ‘look after’ (Tok
Pisin lukautim) (despite the attempts of the proponents of ‘pure’ Manambu to get rid of
them).
   Verbal categories include personal cross-referencing, action focus, tense, aspect (Chapter 12),
moods and modalities (Chapter 13), and verbal negation (Chapter 14). Verb compounding is
employed for valency increase, and to express an array of aspectual and directional meanings—
see Chapter 15. Verbs take a set of directional aﬃxes (see §16.1). A non-productive transi-
tivizing preﬁx derives a morphological causative (see §16.2). Verbs—unlike any other word
classes—can occur in the predicate slot of subordinate clauses (without requiring a support
verb: see Chapters 18 and 19). Verbs fall into at least ﬁve classes depending on root type and
vowel alternations in non-stressed syllables within the verbal paradigm. These are discussed in
§11.3.","[102, 103, 104, 105]"
"  The number of arguments cross-referenced on a fully inﬂected verb does not depend on
the verb’s transitivity: the A/S argument always has to be cross-referenced and a non-subject
argument is only cross-referenced if it is more topical than the subject (see §3.1). The cat-
egories which require fully inflected, partially inflected, and uninflected verb forms
are summarized in Table 11.1. (Numbers of sections where each category is described are in
brackets.)
  The distribution of fully inﬂected, partially inﬂected, and uninﬂected forms to some extent
correlates with clause types. Most non-main (or dependent) clauses contain partially inﬂected
and uninﬂected verbs (see Chapter 19 and Table 19.1, and §20.1.3). So do main clauses marked
for non-declarative mood and modality values, and non-habitual declarative negative clauses.
  Fully inflected verb forms are the most complex of all. They allow the expression of
categories which cannot be expressed in partially inﬂected or uninﬂected verbs.
  Only fully inﬂected main-clause verbs can be within the scope of highlighting focus intro-
duced at §3.1. The pragmatic implications of highlighting focus constructions in Manambu are
discussed at some length in §20.3. And see §14.5 for the ways in which a verb in highlighting
focus is negated.

                               4.5.3 Particles and connectivesThe emphatic particle ya is a class on its own. As shown in §2.5.3, it is a clitic with low selectiv-
ity; it tends to cliticize to a contrastive constituent. It can only go at the end of a constituent,
and may be considered a criterion for constituency. It often accompanies a command or a
permissive form—similar to a command directed to oneself, as in 4.52; in each case, ya makes
the command or the request more urgent. The particle ya shows formal and semantic similarity
to the emphatic ya in Tok Pisin. Since, in Manambu, ya is frequent in spontaneous discourse
but hardly ever appears in traditional planned narratives, it could be originally a Tok Pisin loan
(but is not recognized as such by the speakers).
   The hortative particle jau ‘don’t worry; let it drop; you may do it’ is a class on its own. Jau
often occurs stogether with an imperative in the same clause, and has a tinge of permission, as
in 4.78 which is an invitation to eat one’s ﬁll:
4.78 jau         ak
     don’t.worry impv+eat
     ‘Eat now, don’t worry or feel restrained’
Very occasionally, it occurs with the prohibitive tukwa, as in jau tukwa, lit. ‘don’t let it drop’,
in the meaning of ‘there is no reason to drop this; this is important; there is no reason to
say jau’.
108     4 Word Classes   Jau is semantically similar to Tok Pisin maski ‘let it drop; it is all right’; the two can occur
together, reinforcing each other. When Motuway came across the picture of recently deceased
Wimali, she exclaimed jau maski, as a way of saying ‘oh dear, let it drop!’ The adverb jaujay ‘in
a sloppy, incorrect way’ could be related to jau.
   Connectives are a smallish heterogeneous class:  (a) The clause connective ata ‘then’ is used to mark sequences of clauses in discourse,
      indicating that the clause or the sentence is part of a larger paragraph (see §19.6). It
      typically precedes the verb and never occurs on the ﬁrst sentence in a text (see 4.8, 4.10,
      and 4.12).","[134, 135]"
"
                                      4.5.1 Modal wordsModal words are a small closed class, which consists of two members, b@nak and n@b@ ‘be
able to, can’. Both form a complex predicate with an inﬂected verb in the indicative mood (see
§20.1.2). They are not inﬂected, cannot be negated, or questioned, or appear in a command;
neither do they appear in any of the modalities discussed in Chapter 13. Both have an epistemic
meaning of a potential. The form b@nak appears to be rarer than n@b@ and is always followed
by a verb inﬂected for person, number, and gender of the subject, as in 4.64. It occurs clause-
initially.
4.64 b@nak val        suku-k@-tua
     capable canoe carve-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I can carve a canoe’
   The form n@b@ does not have to occur clause-initially. It always precedes the inﬂected verb.
It can be accompanied by a verb inﬂected for third person singular feminine (basic set). Such
104      4 Word Classesa form can have a generic subject, as in pap@r n@b@ val (a.little.later.on able see+3fem.sgbas.vt)
‘one can see later’. The use of feminine cross-referencing here goes together with the function-
ally unmarked character of feminine in Manambu—see §5.2.3. Depending on the context, such
an expression can be understood as ‘we’, or ‘you’.
   When Tanina said to me s@r n@b@ kwatiya-l (tomorrow able give.to.nonthird.p-
3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘one can give (this to me) tomorrow’, it was clear from the context that I was
the giver. Similarly, 5.27 refers to two people (‘us’) writing together. The referent of the subject
can be speciﬁed, by adding an NP, as in 4.65, or a personal pronoun, as in 4.66.
4.65 pap@r        Jag@r n@b@ val
     little.later Jager able see+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘A little later Jager can see (what’s wrong with the machine)’
4.66 b@r      n@b@ wula-l
     you.two able come.in-3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘The two of you can come in’
   This construction does not appear to be used with ﬁrst person singular subject. The second
alternative is to employ a verb form fully inﬂected for person, number, and gender. Then, there
are no restrictions as to the person of the subject—the ﬁrst person subject is shown in the ﬁrst
clause of 15.53.
   In summary: the modal words form one complex predicate with an inﬂected verb (allowing
for two options of inﬂection). They cannot take any inﬂection themselves, or be used in any
other syntactic function, and can only occur in positive declarative clauses. (The negative
counterpart would be a copula clause with suan yi- (as in 4.7).) This makes them diﬀerent
from any other word class in the language.","[130, 131]"

           16.1.3 Bound directionals and directional suﬃxes: a comparisonBound directionals (A–C in §16.1.2) and directional suﬃxes (D in §16.1.2) share a major
semantic function: both provide directional speciﬁcation to the clause. Yet, they diﬀer in a
number of grammatical properties summarized in Table 16.4 and discussed below.
I. Valency changing is a property of bound directionals. A strictly intransitive verb with
a bound directional has a telic meaning and an obligatory directional speciﬁcation. There is
often a noun phrase specifying the direction of action. An example is at 16.57:
                                                                            16.1 Directionals      399Table 16.4 Directional suﬃxes and bound directionals Property                              Directional suffixes (D)        Bound directionals (A–C) I.

      ground-lk+all jump-down-3masc.sg-compl.ds wa!
      ‘That snake there jumped downwards, onto the ground, after he had jumped (there was
      a sound) wa!’   A directional with an intransitive non-motion verb makes it telic, and adds a resultative
overtone, as in 16.63 (puku-su- (bulge/get.fat-up) ‘get big’).
   A directional used with an ambitransitive verb of either S=O or S=A type has a diﬀerent
eﬀect: it restricts the verb’s transitivity to just its transitive use. We will see, in §16.2, that the
causative-manipulative kay- may have a similar eﬀect.
   The verb t@p- ‘be closed, fence oﬀ’ is an S=O ambitransitive. With a directional, it is always
transitive, as illustrated in 16.23, 16.30, and 10.22b (also see 12.3). The eﬀect of a directional
is similar to that of -taka ‘put’ as V2 in asymmetrical compounds (see 15.62–3). The verb
piñu- ‘slide, slip’ is an S=O ambitransitive. If accompanied by a bound directional, it has a
transitive meaning: piñu-sada-tua (slide-down-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) means ‘I slide (it)
downwards’. The verb ‘look’ used with a directional means ‘look at something; in the direction
of something’, or ‘with a particular purpose’—see examples 16.12, 16.19, 16.34, and especially
16.55–6. If the verb ‘say’ is used with a directional, the addressee needs to be expressed, as in
16.6, or understood as in 16.10.
   The valency-changing or, better, valency-adjusting eﬀect of bound directionals is especially
clear with the general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever, happen’, which is S=O=A ambitransitive.
Without a directional, it can have any transitivity value, depending on what the speaker has
in mind. In 16.58a it is used transitively:16.58a kam@m                m@gi-d@-d
       breadfruit+lk+acc do.whatever-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
       ‘He did whatever to breadfruit’ (in the context: grabbed the breadfruit)   Its intransitive use is shown in 16.58b—this example shows that m@gi- is an S=A ambitran-
sitive:
400      16 Directionals and Valency-Changing Devices16.58b yakraw m@gi-da-l
       thunder do.whatever-3masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
       ‘It was that (that time) thunder did whatever’ (in the context: struck)
  An example like 16.58c shows that the verb m@gi- is also an S=O ambitransitive:
16.58c l@-k@               mæn atawa       m@gi-l-a
       she-obl+fem.sg leg like.that do.whatever-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
       ‘It is the case that her leg whatevered like that’ (in the context: her leg became paralysed)
   If accompanied by a directional, m@gi- has to be transitive, and also refer to a telic action.
Examples are 16.16, 16.42 (also see the full paradigm at 16.2), and 16.58d (here the omitted O
is the foot).
16.58d [a-m@gi-su]            [k@                mæn n@k@r n@k@r kur-kwa]
       impv-do.whatever-up dem.prox.fem.sg foot cold cold get-impv.3p+fem.sg
       ‘Whatever it (the foot) up (in context: put your foot up), may your foot get really cool’
   In contrast, the directional suﬃxes -tay ‘sideways away from speaker’ and -tæy ‘sideways
towards speaker’ do not have any such eﬀect: m@gi-tay- (do.whatever-to.side.away) may mean
either ‘move or aﬀect (something) to side’, or ‘move itself to side’; piñu-tay-tayan (slide-
to.side.away-to.side.away+seq) means ‘sliding side to side’, and may also mean ‘make some-
thing slide side to side’, depending on the context.
   That is, one set of directionals aﬀects transitivity, and the other set does not. The inherently
directional verbs—each of which corresponds to a bound directional (Table 16.1)—do not
aﬀect the verb’s valency (see §15.2, and also V below). The morphological make-up of the
bound directionals accounts for their valency-changing eﬀect. As mentioned above, they could
be composed of the transitive verb s@- ‘put, plant’ followed by an inherently directional verb.
We can recall that verbs sada- ‘put down’ and saku- ‘push outwards’ which contain s@- as an
intrinsically directional verb are transitive.
   This corroborates our hypothesis that the transitive verb s@- ‘put, plant’ imparts a transi-
tivizing value to these morphemes.
II. Adverbial usage is a property of a few bound directional forms, such as -su ‘upwards’ in
16.59–61 and -saku ‘outwards’ in 16.29. We can recall, from Table 16.1, that the directional
-su is unusual in that it is not directly relatable to an inherently directional verb, unlike other
directionals in the paradigm. In their adverbial usage, the directionals modify the verb, as does
the form wuk@-su (listen-up) used in the sense of ‘lending one’s ear’ while listening, in 16.59
(repeated from T3.30; a similar example is in T3.27).

      sit+3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Having gone to another house, she sat on the big post listening to what was above’
  The versatile nature of the form wuk@-su becomes apparent in an adjacent sentence within
the same story (T3.31) where this same form occurs as a bona ﬁde verb, wuk@-su:n (listen-
up+seq) ‘having listened (to what was above)’. A similar example, with the directional -saku
‘outwards’, is at 16.29 (second line).
  A directional verb used adverbially can mark manner, as in 16.60:
                                                                      16.1 Directionals      40116.60 k@                bagula-man@m          yak@-su

      ‘He held on to (the tree) by throwing this ankle of his foot upwards, that old man’
  This is reminiscent of the directionals used with ‘look’. But, unlike any other directional, it
can be used with the inﬂected predicate ellipsed, as in 16.8.
The directional -su ‘up’ used with the generic verb s@- ‘put, plant’ in 16.61 has a somewhat
idiomatic meaning, ‘upwards/upstream a little bit’.
16.61 [Sapaday s@-su waku-n]             [al@m              taka-d@-k]               [wun

      ‘(A group from) Japanday having gone out a little bit upstream, established themselves
      there (lit. put (line) ), then I came’
  We can recall, from A above, that the directional -su ‘up’ does not refer to the upstream
direction—unlike the directional -war in ka-war- ‘bring/take upwards or upstream’. The form
s@su is unlike other directionals in an additional way—it can be used in a noun phrase, similarly
to a postposition, as 16.62.

      ‘Here it is (closer to you), upstream from where the high school is’
   Verbal forms marked with directional suﬃxes -tay ‘sideways away from speaker’ and -tæy
‘sideways towards speaker’ are never used adverbially.
III. Reduplication of a directional is an exclusive property of the directional suﬃx -tay
‘sideways away from speaker’ (see 12.67, 12.70, 16.47). No other directional, including -tæy
‘sideways towards speaker’, can be reduplicated.
IV. Lexicalization is a property of many directionals, especially those meaning ‘across away’
and ‘outwards’— -saki and -saku, and -tay. A few verb roots only occur accompanied by
directionals, e.g. r@m-su (?-up) ‘come up (plants in a garden); heap up (ground)’.
V. Potential replacement with a partly synonymous directional verb is a property of
bound directionals. The directional suﬃxes do not have this option.
   There are two alternatives. The ﬁrst one is to use a verb compound with an inherently
directional verb as V2 . The compound describes something happening while moving in one
of the six directions encoded in inherently directional verbs—that is, concomitant motion (also
see §15.2.2, examples 15.6 and 15.8–12).
   Verb forms with bound directionals do not have an additional movement overtone. In
contrast, they indicate the directionality of the action upon an object. They may also imply
that the position of an object in space was aﬀected.
   The pairs in Table 16.5 illustrate the diﬀerent semantic eﬀect of verb compounds with
inherently directional verbs, and of bound directionals, with the verb yak@- ‘throw’ which
implies motion and directionality, and with the verb yaku- ‘wash’ which does not.
402     16 Directionals and Valency-Changing DevicesTable 16.5 Verb compounds and bound directionals: a comparison Compound with inherently directional V2          Verb with bound directional yak@-war- (throw-go.up) ‘throw and go            yak@-su- ‘throw something upwards’

 downwards or downstream’ yaku-war- ‘wash and go upwards or upstream’      yaku-su- ‘wash in upward direction, e.g. a
                                                  mount or a heap of sago; wash something
                                                  that is heaped up’ yaku-da- ‘wash and go downwards or               yaku-sada- ‘wash in a downward direction;
 downstream’                                      wash something that is located below oneself’ ñam-væki- ‘chew and go across’                   ñam-saki- ‘chew with sideways mouth
                                                  movements’  If a verb does not imply directionality, an inherently directional V2 may refer to a process,
and a bound directional describes reaching a state. An example is at 16.63:
16.63 [ata puku-su-b@r]                 [pukupuku-war@n                t@-br@-k . . . ]
      then bulge/get.fat-up-3dubas.vt/p bulge/get.fat:red-go.up+seq stay-3du-compl.ds
      ‘Then they two got big. As they were getting bigger and bigger (lit. going up in getting
      fat) . . . ’
A verb can combine with either an inherently directional verb or with a directional, if its
meaning is compatible with the idea of concomitant motion or directionality. Directionals do
not occur on atelic verbs. So, kwak@-su- (look.for-up) ?? ‘look for upwards’ is not acceptable;
but in an appropriate context it can mean ‘ﬁnd in an upward direction’.
  The second alternative is a verb-sequencing construction (which can be considered biclausal:
see §18.1). Then, one verb is marked with the sequencing -n and the other verb is fully inﬂected.
The meaning of the sequence is that of concomitant actions and manner. An example is at
16.64, underlined.
16.64 a-d@               m@d-a          ñan ada                             p@k@-yi:n
      dem.dist-masc.sg cassowary-lk child dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg jump-go+seq
      væki-yi:d
      go.across-go+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘That cassowary’s son (topical) went across (the hole) by continuously jumping’
  If the construction ‘jumping he went across’ in 16.64 were replaced with a verb plus a
directional, p@k@-saki- (jump-across.away), it would be grammatical, but its meaning would
have been simply ‘jump across in the direction away from reference point’.
  Semantic aﬃnity between a directional compound and a corresponding verb of motion is
corroborated by examples like 16.65: the verb ‘go downstream’ in the second clause echoes the
directional ‘down’ in the ﬁrst clause:
16.65 [laku-sada-d@-k]                 [da:n        kwa-d]
      pull-down-3masc.sg-compl.ds go.down+seq stay-3masc.sg.bas.vt/p
      ‘After he’d pulled it (canoe) down (from bank), it stayed on water (going) downstream’
                                                                         16.1 Directionals        403   The sequencing construction in 16.66 shows that a bound directional imparts a some-
what diﬀerent meaning to the verb from an inherently directional verb. Here, the direc-
tional refers to jumping up, and the inherently directional verb describes concomitant
motion:
16.66 p@k@-su-yak@-n       war@-d
      jump-up-fully-seq go.up-3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘It (the snake) jumped up fully and went up (into the house)’
   A verb containing two directionals (see §16.1.4) can be rephrased with a compound, and a
sequencing construction, since a compound cannot contain two verbs of motion. So, p@k@-su-
sada- (jump-up-down) meaning ‘jump up and down in the same place’ (see §16.1.4) can be
rephrased as p@k@-war@n p@k@-da-n (jump-go.up+seq jump-go.down-seq) meaning ‘jump while
moving up and down (e.g. on a ladder)’.
   If an intrinsically directional verb ‘carry, bring’ requires an additional directional speciﬁca-
tion, it is likely to be used in a compound with an inherently directional verb as V2 : ka-war-
waku- (carry/bring-up-go out) in 15.7 can mean ‘carry (things) upwards (e.g. to the house)
and out’, or ‘carry (things) upwards and go out’. An alternative is a biclausal sequencing
construction, as in 16.67:
16.67 ka-war-@n        karya-tua-di
      ‘bring’-up-seq take.away-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘I will take (plates) carrying them up (to the house)’
  The verb karya- ‘take away’ develops idiomatic meanings in sequencing constructions, e.g.
wuk@-n karya-n (think-seq take.away-seq) ‘remember, remind’. Just as with bound directionals,
the verb implying movement ‘away’ is more prone to developing idiomatic overtones than its
counterpart meaning ‘towards’.
We conclude that, synchronically, Manambu has two independent grammatical systems: that
of two directional suﬃxes (neither of which has a corresponding inherently directional verb)
and that of six bound directionals (each with a corresponding inherently directional verb). A
directional suﬃx and a bound directional cannot co-occur in one verb. We will now discuss the
ways in which bound directionals can appear together.","[425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430]"
" Bragge (1990: 49) calculates that the approximate date of establishment of Avatip and
Malu could be between 1860 and 1870. This only partly agrees with Harrison’s (1993: 30)
                                                        1.5 Linguistic aﬃliation and prehistory             23observations that ‘Asiti was abandoned at the end of the eighteenth century or early in the
nineteenth’; he estimates dates of founding of Avatip and Malu as ‘some seven generations
ago’ (1993a: 17). An old lady in Avatip (who died in the early 1970s) appeared to have been
only four generations removed from Asiti.
   The story of Yuanab appears to be more intricate. According to some (Harrison 1993: 30),
after the foundation of Avatip, some colonists moved upriver and established the village of
Malu; others migrated still further upstream and settled there with an autochthonous people
to form the village of Yuanab. This is corroborated by oral histories collected by Bragge
(1990)—the origin stories collected by him among the Yuanab people ‘tell of the wandering
ancestors gathering together’ and acquiring a new language—Manambu—for them to use.
Nauwi Sauinambi (a Kwoma man from Bangwis) reports that ‘Yambon [Yuanab] came from
up near Swagup and Alakai, some came from Garamambu. They did not paddle canoes’
(Bragge 1990: 37).
   This suggests that the Yuanab people originally consisted of a number of groups—not
necessarily all speaking one language—‘forced together into a simple village situation by the
Manambu threat’ (37). This ‘language shift’ is dated by Bragge (1990: 48) as having occurred in
about 1830. Originally, the Yuanab-dwellers were ‘dry-land’ people, only recently ‘converted’ to
be river people. This may explain a somewhat aloof attitude of the people of Avatip and Malu
to those from Yuanab. And we can recall, from §1.4, that, according to Paul Badaybæg, after
the Gala wars some of the Gala people hid in Yuanab: this points towards some kind of Gala
substratum in Yuanab. After the end of the S@ruali M@gunay—that is, Gala—war (see §1.4),
the Malu people are said to have destroyed Yuanab, with only two or three people surviving.
   An alternative version is that the Yuanab people abandoned their village and went oﬀ to
bush camps. The next waves of migration to Yuanab came from a Iatmul (Ñaula) speaking
village of Japandai in the early twentieth century (Bragge 1990: 41–6); as a result of arguments
between the new arrivals and the Yuanab people, an armed conﬂict erupted; the Malu people
came to help and took the Yuanab people ‘up to their present village site and set them up there’
(41). It may have been at that stage that Yuanab ‘acknowledged its position as a Manambu
village’.
   The presence of varying substrata is probably what accounts for more pronounced dialectal
diﬀerences between Yuanab and the rest than between, say, Malu and Avatip.
   In the absence of written documents, dating of historical events has to rely on genealogies,
and the information obtained can be contradictory. We saw that the dates for the S@ruali
M@gunay wars vary from early to late nineteenth century. All we can say with assurance is
that the major migrations of the Manambu into more or less their present location within the
area of Ambunti mountain took place in the nineteenth century.
   What do we know about their more remote history? According to the tradition, the
three clans of the Manambu came from three mythical ancestral villages, called saki-t@p
(totemic.ritual-village). 14 The totemic ancestors of the Gla:gw lived near the Yentschang-
gai/Lapanggai areas. The totemic ancestors of the Wulwi-Ñawi lived in a village far to the
east—which, according to some, is the reason why the Wulwi-Ñawi totemically own the
eastward areas, including Australia and places the white people come from, as well as
the ‘white people’s objects’. The word for ‘east’ is wali, also used for ‘white people’. The totemic
ancestors of the Nabul-Sablap lived further to the west, in the direction of the sea (and perhaps  14 Young Manambu men—orators in training—equate the three ancestral villages, Asiti, Maukabu, and
Garaikwali—with the three mythical villages from which the three clan groups had originated. This is the way in
which ethnohistory-in-the-making is now evolving.
24       1 Introductioneven on the coast). They are the ones who ‘carved’ the Sepik River, whose source remains in
their ancestral village (also see Harrison 1990a: 45).
   This may imply that, historically, the Manambu could have consisted of at least three groups
merged together, one of which used to be located towards the coast. This may also explain a
few curious similarities between Manambu and Oceanic languages (see §22.3). But nothing can
be stated with full assurance.
   Diﬀerent subclans of the Manambu, and sometimes even the same subclan in diﬀerent
villages, claim diﬀerent migration routes. The Nagud@u of Avatip say that their ancestors came
from far up the Screw River, in the direction of the Abelam; while the Nagud@u of Yuanab
describe their ancestral ‘home’ as the south-west shore of Lake Chambri (Newton 1971: 64).
This is similar to the ways in which diﬀerent Gala ‘wards’ claim diﬀerent places of origin (see
§1.5.1). This may well reﬂect various layers of population mix and perhaps subsequent language
shifts and unknown substrata, which may be held responsible for the linguistic complexity of
modern Manambu.
   The question of an overall proto-home of the Ndu people remains open. There are indi-
cations of the migrations of some of the Ndu-speaking peoples (Gala) from the north-east
towards the Washkuk Hills. According to Roscoe (1994: 74), ‘it does seem probable that
the early Sepik-Ramu population spawned the ancestors of the Ndu-speaking groups now
spread across the lands from the Middle Sepik to the northern mountains and that these
proto-Ndu arrived ﬁrst in the Middle Sepik region, quite possibly in what is now the Sawos
territory’. However, the exact route of migration is impossible to ascertain, until more archae-
ological and linguistic studies of the surrounding groups are undertaken. 15 The story about
two Manambu brothers carving the Sepik River may suggest the arrival of the Ndu people
by water before the recession of the inland sea, rather than on foot. (The Middle Sepik
River is thought to be the remnant of a vast inland sea which is believed to have reached
its maximum extent between about 5000 and 6500 bc, and was inﬁlled by about 1000 bc:
Chappell 2005: 535–6; Paul Roscoe p.c.) Roscoe (1994: 74; p.c.) points out that ‘the balance
of evidence suggests that the Ndu presence in the Middle Sepik is ancient rather than recent
and that the ancestors of the Abelam and Boiken began moving north many hundreds of years
ago’.
   That is, the proto-home of at least some Ndu peoples could have been the Middle Sepik area.
This requires further study.
                                      1.6 l i n g u i s t i c s i t uat i o nCurrently, Manambu—called by the speakers ‘village language’ (t@p-a kudi) or Manambu
language (Mana:b@ kudi)—is the main language of the ﬁve villages on the Sepik River. It
is used in most homes, especially by older generations (50–80 years of age), and during
traditional ceremonies, such as name debates and the mortuary feast (§1.3.1). At present, there
are no Manambu monolinguals; just a few old ladies, including Gemaj (see Plate 6) are more
comfortable speaking Manambu than Tok Pisin.
   Children’s early socialization starts in Tok Pisin (see §22.4). Most parents in the villages
speak to their children in Manambu as well as Tok Pisin; however, Tok Pisin is the preferred  15 Errors in Foley’s (2005a) linguistic data invalidate his conclusions concerning the interrelationships between the
languages of the Sepik area (§22.2.1).
                                                                   1.6 Linguistic situation      25means of communication between children of all ages. A few women in Avatip come from
other areas of New Guinea, and communicate with their peers, and children, in Tok Pisin. This
enhances the frequency of Tok Pisin, and now also of Papua New Guinea English. Most church
services are conducted mostly in Tok Pisin, with inserts from Papua New Guinea English, and
from Manambu. I attended several SDA church meetings which were mostly in Manambu;
later on I was told that this was done ‘for my sake’.
   Most Manambu who live in towns maintain the language as a means of home communica-
tion. However, their children tend to be proﬁcient just in English, with little knowledge of Tok
Pisin, and even less of Manambu. When these children go back to the village, during school
holidays, the amount of English in the villages soars.
   That is, the overall degree of intrusion of Tok Pisin and English into village life looks
threatening—no wonder many older people complain that the language is doomed and bound
to go (this is comparable to the situation in Taiap described by Kulick 1992). We return to the
prospects for the survival of the language in §22.6.
   Traditional multilingualism now survives mostly in the folk memory. As we saw in §1.4, the
Iatmul (Ñaula) used to be traditional trade partners of a number of the Manambu clans (see
Harrison 1990a: 69–72). These links were based on (a) trade exchange, and (b) shared cultural
practices. Within Manambu clans traditional initiation ceremonies and debates (thoroughly
described by Harrison 1990a) involved ‘trading’ incantations and spells in the closely related
(but far from mutually intelligible) Iatmul. Representatives of older generations—especially
men who achieved high degrees of initiation—used to have a very good knowledge of this
language. A Iatmul inﬂuence is reﬂected in the special ‘shadowy’ style in traditional songs (see
§22.3). Younger people know much less Iatmul.
   Further language knowledge involved traditional trade partners. Older people used to know
the languages of their neighbours and trade partners, especially Kwoma (also see Bowden
1997: xx). This knowledge is drastically diminished among the younger generation. This
gradual disintegration of traditional multilingual patterns, and the increase in knowledge of
the main lingua francas—Tok Pisin, and English—is a worrying sign of traditional language
endangerment on a global scale (see Aikhenvald 2002b).
   Avatip has a primary school (years 1–7), currently with 245 students and 12–13 teachers
(a few of them from other communities: for instance, one is an Arapesh). The headmaster,
Leo Yabwi Luma, is highly competent and proﬁcient in Manambu language and lore. Most
schooling is in Papua New Guinea English together with Tok Pisin. A Manambu vernacular
language programme is under way. Manambu alphabetization materials are created by teachers
themselves. Plate 5 features Tanina Ala displaying one of the posters relating to a story about
‘mother pig’ used in the Avatip school in 2002–3. The primary school in Yawabak (years 1–3)
currently has a vernacular teaching programme; and apparently so does a primary school in
Malu.
   A major problem for teaching Manambu at school is the existing orthography. The orthog-
raphy proposed by SIL missionaries was primarily based on the Yuanab variety which distin-
guishes just one liquid r rather than r and l as in Malu and Avatip (Farnsworth and Farnsworth
1975). The orthography distinguishes all the other consonant phonemes (digraph ny is used for
the palatal ñ). The orthography distinguishes only four vowels rather than nine (see §2.1.2). The
vowels are written as a for /a/, uw for /u/, iy for /i /, and aa for either /a:/ or a sequence /aPa/
(see §2.1.2, on how older speakers pronounce long vowel a: as a sequence of identical vowels
interrupted by a glottal stop). The symbol i is used for @. People complain that this writing
system is bulky—and avoid writing Manambu.
26     1 Introduction   Alternative orthographies have been emerging spontaneously over the years. One exemplar
of this is a story by an elder, Daniel Takendu (1977). The writing system is basically phonetic:
some automatically prenasalized consonants are written as such (d as nd, b as mb, and so on),
and some are not; i is used for @, and also for i , and a double vowel is used for long a:. Palatal
ñ is written as ny. Double consonants appear in stressed syllables. Most enclitics and some
suﬃxes are written as independent words.
   The way Manambu was written in Takendu’s story about the Gala war (1977: 3) is illustrated
in 1.1 (the ﬁrst line of a story about the Gala war). The second line represents the phonological
transcription adopted throughout this grammar.

    3masc.sgnom ritual.oﬃcer name
    ‘In that village that they call Ambunti, there is Makemawi (Ambunti mountain), (this is
    the) name of a ritual oﬃcer’    The orthography used in the primary school programme in Avatip (see Plate 5) combines
features of Takendu’s (1977) with those of Farnsworth and Farnsworth’s (1975) proposals (that
is, iy for i , and uw for u, as in duw ‘man’ rather than du). Enclitics are written as separate words.
The sequence of a labialized consonant gw followed by a schwa @ is marked as gu. Prenasalized
stops are sometimes written as simple stops (as in baal /ba:l/ ‘pig’), and other times as sequences
with a nasal, as in kwarimbaam /kwarba:m/ ‘in the jungle’ and giramb /grab/ ‘afternoon’. A
sample with a corresponding phonological transcription and gloss is in 1.2 below:

    stay-hab-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘I am mother pig, I live in the bush, I have four children, I never sleep day and night’   Perceived inconsistencies and the unwieldiness of the orthographic conventions suggested
by the Farnsworths are a matter of concern for many literate Manambu. There is currently an
interest in developing a new, community-based, orthography.
   The importance of such orthography approved by a consensus of well-respected Manambu
cannot be underestimated: if people start writing their language, this may ultimately diminish
the expansion of Tok Pisin into functional domains reserved for Manambu. For the time being,
the Manambu language is considered ‘diﬃcult to write’.
   Throughout this grammar, all the examples are presented in the phonological transcription
based on the analysis in Chapter 2.

1887, when the members of the New Guinea Company Scientiﬁc Expedition under Schrader,
Hollrung, Schneider, and Hunstein sailed up the Sepik River on board the steamer Samoa
(Zöller 1891: 367–8; Hahl 1980: 126). Zöller (1891: 367) reports that the members of the
scientiﬁc expedition had stayed in a camp at Malu between 22 August and 7 November.
Dr Schrader collected ‘68 words from Zenáp-dialects, 26 words of Mangi-dialects spoken to
the west from it, 132 words from the Malu dialect, 25 words of the neighbouring Yamboni-
dialect [Yambon, or Yuanab, variety], and a further 12 words from a village which lies
further down the river “in the grasshills” ’ (Zöller 1891: 367–8). We have no information on
the nature of this ﬁrst contact, or the ways in which the language data were collected. The
combined wordlist was published by Zöller (1891: Appendix, item 18), under the heading
Augustaﬂuss (Sepik River). It is presented in Appendix 1.1. As shown in the Appendix, sixty-
seven words and expressions are recognizably Manambu, and are presumably from the Malu
dialect.
   Seventeen words in the list are identiﬁable as Western Iatmul. I hypothesize that they
belong to what Zöller calls ‘Yamboni-dialect’, and perhaps reﬂect a dialect of Western Iatmul
spoken where Brugnowi is located now (next to Yuanab/Yambon). Six of these are shared
between Iatmul and Manambu. Five words are similar to Kwoma: this may have been the
language from a Grass Hills village. A further sixty-eight are problematic. Six words are
identiﬁable as Chenapian (note that the materials on Chenapian, published in Laycock and
Z""graggen 1975: 744, are extremely limited). What is meant by ‘Mangi-dialect’ remains a
mystery.
   Zöller’s materials are quoted in Schmidt (1902: 70), under the heading of Sprachen vom
Augustaﬂuss, that is, Languages of the Sepik. He points out the impossibility of making
any deﬁnite pronouncements based on the limited data available, and notes the presence of
repetition in the colour terms nüggi-nüggi ‘red’ (ñiki-ñiki lit. blood-blood) and laggi-galagi
‘yellow’ (lit. laki-ka-laki ginger-intensive-ginger, ‘green’); these forms, still in use in Manambu,
are discussed in §4.3.3 below.
   Behrmann (1922: 178) mentions the greeting kubiaai (k@p@yay), but does not provide any
wordlist. Adolf Roesicke (1914), also a member of the expedition, collected vocabularies, part
                                                                             ´
of which he cites to illustrate the fact that the language spoken ‘from T āmbunum                  ´
                                                                                          to Jāmānŭm
           ´
and Tschĕbandei’      (which is identical with Iatmul) is relatively similar to another language,
spoken in ‘Awatíb, Mālu and Jambŭn’  ´ (that is, Manambu) (508–9). The Manambu part of this
illustrative list is given in Appendix 1.1. 16
   Malu as a group of languages distinct from Iatmul was recognized by Loukotka (1957: 29–
30): ‘Málu. Un petit groupe de langues vers l’ouest. Le Málu est parlé dans un village du même
nom sur le Sepik [Kluge 1938: 176], le Tuo dans un autre village de la même région [Schmidt
1901; 1902], l’Ambunti dans un autre village encore et l’Awatib aussi dans un village /pour les
deux: néant/.’ 17
   16 The full vocabulary has not been located so far. Ulrike Claas (p.c.) suggests that it must have been destroyed
during the Second World War.
   17 Málu. A small group of languages towards the west. Málu is spoken in a village with the same name on the
Sepik River [Kluge 1938: 176], Tuo (is spoken) in another village of the same region [Schmidt 1901; 1902], Ambunti
(is spoken) in one other village, and Awatip is also (spoken) in one village /for both: nothing/.
28     1 Introduction   The ﬁrst missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics to set foot in the Manambu
villages were Janet Dodson (later Allen) and Phyllis Walker (later Hurd) (1962–3). They pro-
duced a sketch of Manambu phonology (Allen and Hurd 1972) based on the Yuanab variety
(also quoted in Pike 1964). Pauline Yuaneng Luma Laki recalls their visit to her house in
Avatip in the early 1960s: they were the ﬁrst white people she had ever seen, and the experience
was scary. They were then replaced by Robin and Marva Farnsworth (1963–80), 18 who worked
mainly in Yuanab (though their major collaborator, Ken Nayau, is from Avatip). (The ﬁrst
survey wordlist collected by Robin Farnsworth in Yuanab [Yambon] is dated 31 December
1964.)
   Robin Farnsworth authored a number of papers (1966, 1975, 1976) on Manambu pro-
nouns and demonstratives, phrases and clauses, and translation problems. Farnsworth and
Farnsworth produced a grammar sketch (1966), and ‘Essentials for translation’ (n.d.), as a
prerequisite for their translation work, in addition to an orthography proposal (1975) and
phonology data (1981?). Marva Farnsworth compiled a number of collections of stories (e.g.
1971, Nyana maaj ‘our speech’), and a draft wordlist (n.d.), in addition to a few booklets
for literacy work and stories (mostly biblical). The Bible, God diki lapa nyig (lit. God his
banana leaf), was published by the SIL, Ukarumpa, in 1979, and dedicated in 1980. On the
request of the Manambu people, a revision of this preliminary translation started in 2001,
with the help of Marva and Robin Farnsworth, and their major collaborator Ken Nayau;
it is currently being undertaken by several groups of Manambu themselves, including Ken
Nayau.
   The phonological analysis of Manambu (based on the Yuanab variety) by Farnsworth
and Farnsworth (1981?) is similar to that in Allen and Hurd (1972): it postulates three
vowel phonemes (i , a, and a:), whose allophones (@, 1, and u; we will see in §2.1.2 that @,
u, and also æ are in fact distinct phonemes) depend on the consonantal environment. This
over-parsimonious analysis resulted in the creation of a complicated orthography (§1.6). The
grammatical analysis is mostly cast in a rather inscrutable tagmemic framework; many of the
paradigms are partial.
   A sketch grammar of Manambu by Laycock (1965: 120–31) contains some partial pronom-
inal paradigms and is on the whole very shallow. The materials obtained, and the ﬁeldwork
methodology, are problematic: the sketch is based on a short span of work with a consultant
who worked as a medical assistant at the Ambunti hospital, while ‘a previous informant . . . was
dismissed after one morning’s work as unsatisfactory’. Despite the statement that both consul-
tants were from Malu, the wordlist contains a number of Yuanab features, which may be due
to dialect mixing. His claim that there are no dialectal diﬀerences between Avatip, Malu, and
Yuanab [Yambon] is incorrect (see §22.6). The language is said to have three vowels, a, @, and 2.
In his 1991 paper, Laycock postulated the existence of a long vowel a: for all the Ndu languages,
including Manambu.
   Harrison (1990a) and (1993) contain a wealth of lexical items, phrases, and sentences
in Manambu, in addition to incisive observations about such aspects of Manambu seman-
tics as the concept of mawul ‘insides; location of emotions’ and kayik ‘image, shadow’
(§21.4).","[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]"
"   In contrast, ‘current relevance’ demonstratives do not take cases at all—the same form refers
to an argument or an oblique in any function.
   Nominal demonstratives are employed in the function of local adverbial demonstratives
(Dixon 2003: 69). Spatio-temporal demonstratives without a directional speciﬁcation are
always marked with locational cases when they refer to locations, e.g. k@-l@-m (dem.prox-fem-
loc) ‘here’, k@-l@-r (dem.prox-fem-all) ‘towards here’, wa-l@-m (dem.prox.addr-fem-loc)
‘here (close to addressee)’, a-l@-m (dem.dist-fem-loc) ‘there’, and so on. Those with directional
speciﬁcation tend to take cases, but do not have to, e.g. a-l-@-da-m (dem.dist-fem.sg-lk-down-
loc) ‘there underneath’, a-l-@-da (dem.dist-fem.sg-lk-down) ‘there underneath’.
   We ﬁrst discuss (A) spatio-temporal demonstratives and their usage, and then (B) ‘current
relevance’ demonstratives. In (C), we compare directional meanings distinguished in demon-
stratives and in verbs. Types of orientation, or frames of reference, prevalent in the Manambu
speech communities are addressed under (D).
A. Spatio-temporal demonstratives refer to relative distance in space or in time and dis-
tinguish either (i) two or three additional degrees of distance, or (ii) ﬁve directions. The
demonstratives which distinguish additional distance are in Table 10.1. The spatio-temporal
demonstratives unmarked for additional distance are discussed in A1. Those with segmental
marking for additional distance are considered in A2.
   The choice of a feminine gender marker in spatio-temporal demonstratives is governed by
the following principle: if there is a segmental morpheme following the agreement marker, the
-l form is used, e.g. a-l-@m (dem.dist-fem.sg-lk+loc) ‘there’ (see §5.1.2), a-l-a-wur (dem.dist-
fem.sg-lk-up) ‘that one feminine which is up’ (see A3 and Table 10.2). Otherwise, the feminine
form is ø, e.g. a ‘that one feminine’.
   All the demonstratives have spatial uses; some can also refer to time. The proximal and distal
demonstratives unmarked for additional distance—discussed in A1—can be used for textual
deixis, that is, anaphora of diﬀerent kinds. The ‘proximal to addressee’ demonstrative can be
used to imply a speaker’s detachment, and also mark empathy with the hearer, in a narrative.
It cannot be used to refer to time. A summary is in Table 10.1. Demonstratives are underlined
throughout this section.

demonstrative stem followed by a gender-number marker.
(i) Spatio-temporal uses. In its spatio-temporal use, the demonstrative k@- refers to an object
close to the speaker, as in 6.6, 6.8, and 10.12. In 6.6 the demonstrative is used to address
the two mothers, ‘these two of you (close to me)’. In 10.12, the two instances of headlessly
used k@- refer to two diﬀerent girls, both sitting next to the speaker (accompanied with
pointing).10.12 [k@                 n@ma        t@-ku]              k@-l-@k
      dem.prox.fem.sg big+fem.sg become-compl.ss dem.prox-fem.sg-lk+dat
      kui-l@-di
      give.to.third.p-3fem.sgsubj.p-3plbas.p
      ‘After this one (girl) has become big, she has given them (her clothes) to this one’   This same demonstrative can be considered the semantically unmarked ‘proximate’, since
it often indicates proximity of the object to both speaker and addressee. This is the case in
6.8, where k@-d@ (this-masc.sg) refers to ‘this village where we are now’, that is close to both
speaker and hearer. In contrast, the demonstrative wa- ‘close to the addressee’ is used to stress
                                                                   10.2 Demonstratives        203the fact that the object is close to the addressee (and not so close to the speaker), as in 10.13.
The locative form of the proximate demonstrative k@- in 10.13 refers to a location close to the
speaker, but not to the addressee.
10.13 wa-d@                      wa:r             k@-l-@m           a-kaytak
      dem.prox.addr-masc.sg large.string.bag dem.prox-fem.sg-lk+loc impv-attach
      ‘Put this (close to you/your) stringbag here’
   This demonstrative can combine reference to spatial proximity and possessive relationship:
in 10.14, wa-d@ ‘this masculine close to you’ refers to a child belonging to a mother and thus
‘close’ to her, as an addressee. The man is giving orders to his two wives with their respective
children.
10.14 ñ@n         Sirunki wa-d@                      ñ@n-a-d@                  ñ@nwa     Lai

      ‘You, Sirunki, we will go tomorrow together with this (close to you) son of yours to that
      dance. You, Kayak, having got this (close to you, that is, your) son, stay’
  This form (zero-marked for additional distance) can also be used in a slightly derogatory
sense, referring to something belonging to the addressee the speaker wishes to have nothing
to do with. In 10.15 the main character, Kuimagan, is rebuking one of his two wives who
had taken a wrong road and is thus responsible for a disaster that had happened to her son.
Kuimagan does not want to have anything more to do with the wretched boy. He refers to the
boy as ‘this-close to you’:
10.15 al@k                        wuka                                wa-d@

      he(+lk)+he-obl bad         say-2fem.sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘This is why here (close to you), this-close-to-you boy, you yourself made him himself
      (be) in a bad way’
  A similar example is in the last line of 10.29 where the speaker uses this same demonstrative
to refer to the Swakap people for whom he has hardly any respect. Another reason for using
the ‘close-to-listener’ demonstrative there is that the speaker knew that the Swakap people were
of particular interest to me as a listener.
  The distal demonstrative a- can be used to refer to an object which is close to neither speaker
nor addressee, as in 10.16. Here, the proximal demonstrative k@- is contrasted to the distal a-:
10.16 k@-d@                 du ma:, a-d@        du-ad
      dem.prox-masc.sg man neg dem.dist-masc.sg man-3masc.sgnom
      ‘It is not this man, it is that man’
Only k@- and a- stems are used for temporal reference. The zero-marked proximal demon-
strative refers to an ongoing stretch of time, e.g. k@ wik (dem.prox+fem.sg week) ‘this week
now’, k@-d@ nabi (dem.prox-masc.sg year) ‘this year now’; a wik (dem.dist+fem.sg week) ‘that
204     10 Closed Classes(last) week’. And the zero-marked distal demonstrative refers to past, e.g. a-d@ nabi (dem.dist-
masc.sg year) ‘that (past) year’. (Demonstratives discussed under A2 below refer to more
remote stretches of time.)
(ii) Anaphoric uses. As a marker of participant anaphora, the demonstrative k@- ‘close to
speaker’ refers to a topical referent just mentioned or previously discussed, as in 6.4–5 (there,
the demonstrative k@- ‘close to speaker’ refers to the clans talked about). A similar example is
10.17: it is the beginning of a story about a group of Japanese who tried to escape after the war
into the Sepik area, and how they were massacred by the combined forces of the Manambu
and the Iatmul. We were discussing this event before the beginning of the story: this explains
the anaphoric use of the demonstrative in the ﬁrst line:10.17 k@-di         Japanese [war kus@-l@-k]                  [1945 kus@-l@-k],

      paddle+seq river-lk-fully go.up-3plbas.p
      ‘These Japanese (we have just talked about), after the war had ﬁnished, after it ﬁnished
      in 1945, then after some of them had escaped, these people went straight up the Sepik
      River paddling’   The proximal demonstrative k@- is never used cataphorically (that is, to mark forwards
anaphora). It can only be used for textual anaphora when it modiﬁes the noun ma:j
‘story’.
   The distal demonstrative a- is most frequently used for substitution anaphora, as in 10.14,
where ‘to that dance’ refers to a dance mentioned in the preceding clause. It is never used with a
new referent, and tends to occur with deﬁnite referents only, especially the ones to be deployed
as topics of a whole text. In 10.18, the demonstrative refers to previously mentioned foodstuﬀ
which Sirunki had brought with her:10.18 [ [amæy, wun ka:m yasa-na-wun],                     wa-d@-k],

      give.to.third.p-3fem.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘After the small child had said: “Mother, I am hungry”, she gave him the foodstuﬀ she’d
      brought’   The distal demonstrative is also used as a marker for deﬁnite (that is, uniquely identiﬁable)
referents, as in 10.19, where Kuimagan addresses his two wives as ‘the (lit. those) two women’:10.19 [a-b@r      ta:kw, awuk,        wun-a          maj@k]
      dem.dist-du woman impv+listen I-lk+fem.sg speech+lk+dat
      ‘(Kuimagan thus said) “The two women, listen to my speech” ’  As similar example is in 10.3 where the demonstrative is accompanied by a third person
pronoun. Unlike the proximal demonstrative, the distal demonstrative can be used for textual
anaphora (but not for cataphora of any kind). The distal demonstrative, but not the proximal
one, can be used as a modiﬁer in a headless relative clause, as in 10.20.

  It is instructive to compare the use of k@ ‘close to speaker’ and a ‘distal’ as anaphoric
markers. If one referent is mentioned more recently than the other, it is referred to with the
proximal demonstrative, and the other one with the distal, as in 10.21.

   If there are two equal alternatives, the least important one is likely to be referred to with
the distal demonstrative, and a more important one with the proximal. In 10.22, Kuimagan is
giving his two wives instructions on what to do. They are supposed to encounter two roads
(introduced in 10.22a). The roads are anaphorically referred to with the distal demonstrative
(in 10.22b). Then he introduces a tree w@pak whose leaf he was going to place on the road
which the women are not to follow (10.22c, same as 7.21). The tree is anaphorically referred to
with the distal demonstrative, and so is one of the roads—the one that the women should
not take. The correct (and thus the more important) one is referred to with the proximal
demonstrative in 10.22d.

206     10 Closed Classes  The two anaphoric demonstratives can have the same referent, as in 10.23. The proximate
demonstrative is more expressive, and used to draw the hearer’s attention to this very village
we are talking about.

      ‘This very village, that village of big name debates, submerged again’
   The two demonstratives have a number of additional uses. The demonstrative k@ ‘close to
speaker’ as predicate head (usually as functionally unmarked feminine) occurs in the meaning
of emphatic ‘no’, as in 10.24 and 14.41. This is similar to how one can exclaim ‘what on earth is
that!’ as a token of negative reaction or amazement. Whenever it is used in a negative meaning,
an alternative—that is, the correct ‘solution’—is usually suggested (see §14.6).

      ‘After she’d said: “Whose house is it?”, (they said) “That??? (meaning No!) Yours??? It
      is our house.” ’
   The distal demonstrative a- is used as a connective ‘then, so’ in its functionally unmarked
feminine form, as in the second line of 10.22b. The dative feminine form of the distal demon-
strative is used as a sentence connective al@k (dem.dist.fem.sg+lk+dat) ‘this is why’ (see 4.16,
10.15, 10.36, and §19.6).
   Within a narrative, the ‘close to hearer’ demonstrative can occasionally be used to refer to a
previously mentioned referent, to indicate empathy with the audience, and to encourage their
attention whenever the narrator may feel that their attention is slipping away. In 10.25, the two
women, the protagonists of the story, are referred to in this way: Maguniway, the narrator, used
it as a device to make sure we, the audience, were listening:
10.25 [wa-b@r             ta:kw na:gw yaku-ta:y]        t@-br@-k
      dem.prox.addr-du woman sago wash-cotemp stay-3du-compl.ds
      ‘After these two women (close to you—so do listen) had stayed washing sago . . . ’
   This is reminiscent of the attention-getting use of this same demonstrative marked for
additional spatial distance—see A2 below (e.g. 10.30).
   The less formally marked nominal demonstratives have more functional and semantic exten-
sions (and thus may be considered functionally unmarked) than those which receive additional
formal marking for distance—see A2. This agrees with a tendency of correlating formal and
functional markedness, a pervasive feature of the Manambu grammar.
A2. Spatio-temporal demonstratives marked for additional distance consist of a demon-
strative stem followed by a distance marker and then by a gender-number marker. All of these
are used for spatial, and some also for temporal reference.
   The form k@- ‘close to speaker’ + -ay ‘additional distance’ refers to objects close to the
speaker, but somewhat further away than k@- ‘proximate; close to speaker’, and often also
visible. The Ambunti mountain (called Mak@mawi) towering over the Sepik River and perfectly
visible from Avatip was referred to as k@-d-ay n@b@k (dem.prox-masc.sg-dist mountain) ‘this
distant mountain’.
                                                                  10.2 Demonstratives        207   However, an object referred to with the proximate demonstrative marked for additional
distance may not be visible from where the speaker is located; yet it can be conceptualized as
being within the ‘close’ range. In 10.26 Aulapan referred to the stream close to Yawabak (where
the story was told), but not visible from the place we were sitting, as k@-d-ay b@yib (dem.prox-
masc.sg-dist stream). In the second clause of this example, the whole area is anaphorically
referred to with the distal demonstrative a, unmarked for additional distance:10.26 [waku-d@-k                 k@-d-ay               b@yib Balj@b-@-m], orait,

      dem.dist-fem-lk-loc go.out-compl.ss sit+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘After he had emerged on this-further-away stream Balj@b, all right, (his adversary)
      stayed there having emerged’   The form a- ‘distal’ + -ay ‘additional distance’ refers to objects considerably further away
from both speaker and addressee than those referred to with a simple a ‘distal demonstrative’.
In 10.27, from the same story as 10.26, alayir refers to a location very far from Yawabak:10.27 a-l@-da                 kawawa        a-l-ayir
      dem.dist-fem.sg-down hole+lk+com dem.dist-fem.sg-dist+lk+all
      waku-d
      go.out-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘He emerged via that hole down below (going) towards over there (a remote location)’  The k@- and a- stems with the additional distance marker -ay refer to future and past time
respectively, e.g. k@-l-ay wik (dem.prox-fem.sg-dist week) ‘next week’, k@-d-ay nabi (dem.prox-
masc.sg-dist year) ‘next year’, a-l-ay wik (dem.dist-fem.sg-dist week) ‘week before last’, a-d-ay
nabi (dem.dist-masc.sg-dist year) ‘year before last’.
  The form wa- ‘close to addressee’ + -ay often implies that the referent is closer to the
addressee than to the speaker, but not in close proximity to either. When we went to visit
Damel at her house, I asked Mali which of the two ﬁreplaces belonged to Damel. Damel’s
ﬁreplace was in the other end of the house, and somewhat closer to me than to Mali, so she
said:10.28 l@-k@             t@n@b     wa-l-ay                     aka
      she-obl+fem.sg ﬁreplace dem.prox.addr-fem.sg-dist dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
      ‘Her ﬁreplace is here further away from us both but closer to you’  In his story about the Swakap people and how they went to live with the people at Yuanab
(Yambon), the narrator used wa-d-ay (dem.prox.addr-masc.sg-dist) ‘this close to addressee
further away’ twice because the place where I was sitting was slightly closer to the direction
where Yuanab is:10.29 yi:n              wa-d-ay                     Yuanab

       together with the Yambon people, these-close-to-you Yambon people are the ones from
       Swakap’
   The form wa- ‘close to addressee’ + -ay is used as an address term for a familiar interlocutor,
e.g. wa-l-ay (dem.prox.addr-fem.sg-dist) ‘hey you (woman), you here (close to addressee)’, wa-
d-ay (dem.prox.addr-masc.sg-dist) ‘hey you (man), you here (close to addressee)’. An example
is under 10.30 where the mother was calling to her baby daughter, trying to stop her playing
with her mother’s food:
10.30 wun-a          kami:-a,         kayk@t@-tukwa wa-l-ay!
      I-lk+fem.sg ﬁsh-3fem.sgnom hold-proh.gen dem.prox.addr-fem.sg-dist
      ‘It is my ﬁsh, do not hold (onto it), hey you here!’
   Such an address form can be optionally accompanied by ñan ‘child’ (if referring to a woman
or a non-initiated man). That is, it is somewhat conventionalized.
   The proximal demonstrative k@- accompanied by the marker of very remote distance -awi is
used to refer to objects more remote than the ones referred to with k@- + -ay ‘distance’, and
yet conceived as not too remote from the speaker. Two proximal demonstratives marked for
additional distance within the same sentence in 10.31 illustrate this idea of ‘relative’ remoteness.
The narrator is vehement about a particular clan having no right to the piece of land beyond the
Ambunti mountain, quite far away (beyond visibility range, referred to as k@-l-ay (dem.prox-
fem.sg-dist) ‘this-distant’), and far up the Sepik River (k@-l-awi (dem.prox-fem.sg-very.dist)
‘this-very distant’):

      k@-l-awi-a:b
      dem.prox-fem.sg-very.dist-too
      ‘In this (distant place), it is not their land; in this very distant place, too’
   The distal demonstrative a- accompanied by the marker of very remote distance -awi is
used to refer to extremely remote objects, e.g. a-l-awi t@ p (dem.dist-fem.sg-very.dist village)
‘a village very far away’—as I was told, such a village would be somewhere ‘over the horizon’.
The source (headwaters) of the Sepik River was referred to as alawi. In 10.32 (continuation
of 10.31), this demonstrative refers to a village located very far away from the deictic centre
(the outskirts of the Malu village), next to the Yessan (which is beyond Ambunti and further
inland). The unmarked distal demonstrative in 10.32 is used anaphorically (referring to the
village mentioned before).

A3. Spatio-temporal demonstratives distinguishing direction consist of a demonstra-
tive stem followed by a gender-number marker and then by one of ﬁve directionals: see
Table 10.2.
   These demonstratives are used for spatial deixis, indicating location of an object with respect
to the speaker (‘relative’ frame of reference: Levinson 2003). Gemaj said 10.33, showing me the
stars up in the sky (who are supposed to be the totemic ancestors of the clan group I was
adopted into):
10.33 k@-di-a-wur           kugar gwalugw-adi
      dem.prox-pl-lk-up star ancestors-3plnom
      ‘These stars up (in the sky/above us) are ancestors’
   Or it can indicate the location of an object with respect to an important landmark (‘absolute’
frame of reference). Within the Sepik area, this is invariably the Sepik River itself, as in 10.27
(location downstream) and in 10.34. The previous location of Avatip is further away from the
river (since it has been ﬂooded after the river had changed its course). This ‘old’ village is
remote from the present one, and this is why the distal demonstrative is used.

      ‘The name of that (big) village inland is Tepayaburman’
  Along similar lines, as we were walking along a path parallel but not close to the river,
Kerryanne told me to walk on the other side of the path (to avoid mud) which was ‘inland’ from
the Sepik River (k@-l-a-wulam: dem.prox-fem.sg-lk-inland+loc). The lake (which is where the
Yawabak village is located) is considered as being in an ‘outward’ direction from the Sepik
River, as shown in 10.35:

  A reference point with respect to which the direction is determined can be established within
a narrative. The man raised by a ﬂying fox and two birds lives up the tree; his mother, the
ﬂying fox, allows him to marry a woman who is underneath the tree by saying 10.36. A
woman had requested to marry a-d-a-wur du (dem.dist-masc.sg-lk-up man) ‘that man up
there’.

   One often hears these demonstratives in conversations where diﬀerent directions are useful
for disambiguating classiﬁcatory relatives in the same relationship to the speaker. For instance,
if I am sitting in a house in a company of classiﬁcatory sisters, I may well refer to one as k@-l-aki
ñamus (dem.prox-fem.sg-across.away younger.sibling) ‘this younger sister sitting across from
me’, and to the other as k@-l-a-wula ñamus (dem.prox-fem.sg-lk-inland younger.sibling) ‘this
younger sister sitting closer to the part of the house further away from the Sepik River than me’.
   The ‘close to speaker’ and the distal demonstratives are often used anaphorically, exactly as
in (ii) under A1 above. In 10.37, Katalu announced that the story he was about to tell was to
deal with the previously mentioned place up the river:

  We have seen that speciﬁcations of additional distance and of direction are not compatible
within one demonstrative. As a result, two demonstratives often occur together in one NP—
one specifying the direction, and the other additional distance. The surface order is always
that illustrated in 10.38: direction ﬁrst, distance second. No other constituents can intervene
between the two demonstratives.

  This is the only technique available for combining information about additional distance
and direction in one NP.
B. The ‘current relevance’ demonstratives distinguish either (i) two degrees of distance
(B1), or (ii) ﬁve directions (B1). A ‘current relevance’ demonstrative refers to an object which
is being talked about, or is known or important to the speakers. It tends to be mentioned just
prior to referring to it with a demonstrative; but more often than not it is part of information
shared by the speech act participants.
B1. The ‘current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing additional distance are in
Table 10.3.
   The ‘far from both speaker and addressee’ ‘current relevance’ demonstrative distinguishes
a further degree of distance—‘very distal’. In contrast to the spatio-temporal demonstratives
discussed in A, the proximate k@- does not have this distance speciﬁcation.
   The morpheme -ay has diﬀerent meanings with spatio-temporal and with ‘current relevance’
demonstratives. With the former it has a meaning of ‘further from speaker; or hearer; or both’
(depending on the choice of the stem). With ‘current relevance’ demonstratives it is like a
                                                                   10.2 Demonstratives          211   Table 10.3 ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing additional distance     Stem                          ‘Current relevance’      Distance

                                  -na-
                                                            -awi ‘very far indeed’‘placeholder’ which obligatorily accompanies the marker -na- ‘current relevance’. It is in a
paradigmatic opposition with -awi ‘very far indeed (from both speaker and hearer)’, but only
for the stems k@- and a-. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives often have a locational meaning;
but can also be used as prehead modiﬁers, e.g. k@-na-y k@-l-ay ñan (dem.prox-curr.rel-dist
dem.prox-fem.sg-dist child) ‘this mentioned further away female child’, and also 10.40. A
‘current relevance’ demonstrative can occur with time words: a-na-y nabi (dem.dist-curr.rel-
dist year) means ‘that (past) year we are/were talking about’, and k@-na-y nabi (dem.prox-
curr.rel-dist year) refers to ‘this (present) year we are/were talking about’.
   ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives are semantically complex. The ‘current relevance’ marker
-na- shows that it has been previously mentioned, or talked about, or that it is something the
speaker has in mind. And a demonstrative stem indicates the position of the object with respect
to the speaker or the hearer or both. The ‘relevant’ referent may occur in the previous stretch
of discourse, as in line ﬁve of T3.43: a-na-y (dem.dist-curr.rel-dist) ‘that mentioned’ refers
to the place visited by the character where he claims to have killed all the snakes. The place was
overtly mentioned two clauses earlier.
   Or the demonstrative may refer to an object or a place interlocutors can both see at the same
time, and/or have just been talking about, as in 10.39. The ﬁreplace is closer to the speaker than
to the addressee.
10.39 wun-a        wuti k@-na-y                       r@-na
      I-lk+fem.sg spoon dem.prox-curr.rel-dist sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘My spoon is sitting here (on the ﬁreplace we have just been cleaning together)’
   Spatio-temporal demonstratives and ‘current relevance’ demonstratives can occur together
in one NP, as in 10.40, and always in this order: a current relevance demonstrative with
no gender or number speciﬁcation occurs ﬁrst and a spatio-temporal one comes next. The
two complement each other, since the ‘current relevance’ demonstrative here does not convey
information about the gender of the noun or the additional distance.
10.40 ñan k@-na-y                    k@-d-ay                numa-d@      wi-a:m

      big house’
212     10 Closed Classes  Alternatively, a spatio-temporal and a ‘current relevance’ demonstrative can refer to the
same location—in 10.41 it is the sky. The fact that the moon’s location appears to be close
to us and has just been talked about is reﬂected in the use of k@-na-y ‘this/here-previously
mentioned’. The fact that it is up there in the large (and hence ‘masculine’) sky far away is
reﬂected in the use of a-d-a-wur ‘that masculine up there’.
10.41 bap-a-ta:kw      aka                       war-na

      ‘Lady moon is now going up, here previously mentioned (in the sky (masculine) ) up
      there, the moon’
  Or a ‘current relevance’ demonstrative can be added to a spatial demonstrative, to make sure
the addressee realizes that the object pointed at is the one under discussion. Example 10.28 was
rephrased as 10.42:
10.42 l@-k@            t@n@b     wa-l-ay
      she-obl+fem.sg ﬁreplace dem.prox.addr-fem.sg-dist

      ‘Her ﬁreplace is here further away from us both but closer to you, the ﬁreplace close to
      you we have been talking about’
B2. The ‘current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing direction are in Table 10.4
   These are used similarly to spatial demonstratives distinguishing direction. Example 10.43
is Gemaj’s answer to the question whether there is moonlight outside (so as to help me
decide whether to take a torch with me or not). The question was: bap-a-ta:kw t@ba:m t@-
na? (moon-lk-woman sky+lk+loc have/be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘is the lady moon in the
sky?’
10.43 bap k@-na-wur                  b@um        t@-na
      moon dem.prox-curr.rel-up haze+loc have/be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘The moon is up there (location we are talking about) in the haze’
  A location or an object referred to with the ‘current relevance’ demonstrative may not be
overtly mentioned at all—it is enough for it to be in the focus of people’s attention. A mother
used to say 10.44 to her baby daughter to stop her from going into a corner of the house where
the food was stored (located downriver with respect to the Sepik River’s course), believing that
the girl should be scared of imaginary mice:         Table 10.4 ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing direction          Stem                          ‘Current relevance’    Distance

      ‘A mouse is sitting here-close-to-you in the mentioned (downstream) location!’   ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives are subtly diﬀerent from anaphoric demonstratives.
Anaphoric demonstratives provide a relationship between a pronoun and ‘another element, in
the same or in an earlier sentence, that supplies its referent’ (Matthews 1997: 18), and ‘are used
for reference to something earlier . . . in discourse’. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives state that
the referent is within the discourse (being mentioned, or talked about), or within the frame of
attention of the participants in a situation. Their scope is thus broader than simple anaphora,
though the analogy between the two is striking.
C. Directional distinctions in nominal demonstratives and in verbs (see Tables 10.5 and
16.1) share a number of similarities, but are rather diﬀerent. (In the majority of cases, verbal
directional markers do not attach directly to the verbal root: they appear on a dummy root
s@-.)
   Directional markers on verbs and on demonstratives distinguish directions upward (marked
somewhat diﬀerently), downward, across, outwards, and inwards (all marked similarly). In
addition, directionals with verbs also distinguish motion towards the speaker (absent from
demonstratives), and two types of motion sideways. These diﬀerences can be accounted for by
the fact that directionals on verbs are inherently associated with motion, while with demon-
stratives they refer to location in space.
   While directionals on demonstratives always have spatial reference, those on verbs can
be extended metaphorically and acquire idiosyncratic meaning, e.g. ‘talk-across away from
speaker’ means ‘to tell a traditional story’, and ‘die-across away from speaker’ means ‘half-die,
almost die’. This is discussed in §16.1. In that same section we look at how directional markers
can be used, or avoided, on verbs, and on demonstratives, within one clause.
214      10 Closed ClassesD. Frames of reference in Manambu are of three basic kinds.
  Intrinsic frame of reference (that is, reference from the perspective of the ground object) is
employed for describing positions of objects within an enclosed space (e.g. top of mosquito
net), as in 10.45:10.45 wun-a         aba-wapwi       k@-l@-m         api-ñ@g-a:m

      r@-na
      sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘My hat is here on top of the mosquito net’It can also be used to describe the location of one landmark relative to another, as in 10.46.","[228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"
"                                         20.4.3 EllipsisBeing elaborate and precise is a skill highly appreciated for story tellers and orators in the
Manambu speech communities. In contrast, day-to-day speech is highly elliptical. If a noun
phrase is recoverable from the context, it won’t be overtly mentioned. In 20.36a and 20.36b
the referents of the full pronouns were obvious (‘me’ and ‘you feminine’), so they did not
have to be stated. And we saw that in 20.41 the subject was omitted—also because it is clear
from the context. In 8.4 only the gender agreement shows that the possessed noun ‘house’ has
been omitted. This was Yipawal’s answer to my question ‘Where is your house?’ The reply
was, literally, ‘I this one (masculine)’. Further possibilities of ellipsis are illustrated with the
following snippets of dialogue.
   Consider 20.92–3. The sentence under a is a question, and b is an answer to it. The question
in 20.92a is itself elliptical: we were talking about some women going to Maprik to sell ﬁsh, so
this part is not stated:20.92a s@-k@-dadi           yi-k-na-di?
       who-obl-3pl+3plnom go-fut-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘Who is going (to Maprik to sell ﬁsh)?’ (lit. Who are going?)  The idea of the answer in 20.92b is that the speaker was going to ﬁnd out who was going and
then give them money to buy her some hair cream:20.92b kwak@-ku      kui-k@-tua-di
       ﬁnd-compl.ss give.to.third.p-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
       ‘Having found (them), I will give (it: money) to them’
                                             20.4 Further issues in discourse organization         547  In 20.93a, the speaker asks the guest whether he’d come from Yawabak on foot. Note the
absence of the overt pronoun: it is omitted, since the cross-referencing on the inﬂected verb
conveys who the subject is:
20.93a n@b@-say               ya-na-d@m@n?
       dry.ground+lk-transp come-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘Have you come on foot?’ (lit. via dry ground)
   The addressee replies, omitting the main verb. The dependent clause is postposed to the
elliptical main clause (which consists just of the instrument, ‘with a canoe’), as a clariﬁcation:
the speaker wants the audience to know that he came all the way just paddling (and therefore
is tired and wouldn’t mind refreshments).
20.93b [vala-r@b]         [gus   kan]
       canoe+lk-fully paddle paddle+seq
       ‘Straight with a canoe, paddling a paddle’
The main verb can only be omitted if it has been introduced in the preceding discourse.
For instance, if A says wali-kamna:gw ak@s k@-kwa-na (white.people-food neg.hab eat-hab-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she never eats white people’s food’, B is likely to add wun-aba:b ak@s
(I-too neg.hab) ‘I too never’. The latter clause would not make sense on its own, taken out
of context. In 20.94—an example of a desubordinated clause, similar to 19.113b—both object
and verb have been omitted from the second clause:
20.94 d@-k@             buk al@-da:m                      taka-ku         wun api:m
      he-poss+fem.sg book dem.dist+fem.sg-down+loc put-compl.ss I             top+loc
      ‘I have put his notebook underneath, and mine on top’ (lit. having put)
   Elliptical clauses are very frequent in informal interaction. We saw in §19.9 how desubordi-
nated clauses—which can be considered the result of conventionalized ellipsis—are employed
as command strategies. An elliptic clause can be used as a command, with a particularly strong
illocutionary force (similar to desubordinated medial clauses in Table 19.5), e.g. ap k@ka (bone
dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg) ‘This bone!’ meaning ‘Put this bone here (or put it down) (or
else)!’
   Instead of producing a full clause, as in 7.29, people would just shout: ak@m t@-ku?
(where+loc stay-compl.ss) ‘where (are you/(s)he/they) coming from?’ And we can recall that
just one word, marked with dative, is enough to verbalize an impending threat: Tanina would
shout diya:k (shit+lk+dat) ‘(beware) of (dog’s) shit’, and I would know to watch my step.
Along similar lines, a reciprocal marker was omitted in 14.114, since the sentence can only
have a reciprocal reading.
   If a support verb, or an auxiliary, is easy to supply, it can also be omitted, as in 20.95–6, and
in 17.49–50—this latter was uttered by an angry speaker immediately on entering our house
one Saturday. The context was clear; and the form luku only occurs with the verb kur- —so no
ambiguity could possibly arise. A similar example is at 20.95a: the support verb which occurs
with sua:l is either kur- or taka-; so it appears to be easily omissible in a quick dialogue (from
a story):
20.95a [ñ@n      sua:l kur-ñ@n-@k]                 [wa-l@-k]                [ka
       you.fem lie       do-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf say-3fem.sg-compl.ds dem.prox.fem.sg
       wun sua:l ma:]
       I     lie    neg
       ‘ “You are lying (lit. doing a lie)”, she having said, (the other said), “no! (lit. this!), I am
       not lying (lit. I a lie not)” ’
548     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesThe last clause without ellipsis would be rendered as in 20.95b (the ellided word is underlined,
here and in the further examples in this section):
20.95b wun sua:l ma: kwa:r
       I     lie   neg do+neg
       ‘I am not lying’ (lit. I am not doing a lie)
  Along similar lines, mak@n ‘be in mourning’ can be omitted from a complex predicate with
kwa-ya- (stay-come), as in 20.96a. This verb is typically used in combination with ‘mourning’.
The aﬀected participant is overtly expressed and the context states that he or she had indeed
died. This makes ‘mourning’ recoverable from the context, and thus dispensable.
20.96a [kiya-d@-k]              [ya:kya] [d@-k@-k       kwa-ya-di]
       die-3masc.sg-compl:ds OK            he-obl-dat stay-come-3plbas.p
       ‘After he’d died, OK, (his relatives) stayed (in mourning) for him’
  The full clause, without ellipsis, would be:
20.96b [kiya-d@-k]              [ya:kya] [d@-k@-k       mak@n        kwa-ya-di]
       die-3masc.sg-compl:ds OK            he-obl-dat in.mourning stay-come-3plbas.p
       ‘After he’d died, OK, (his relatives) stayed in mourning for him’
   If a support verb is omitted from the main clause, and the clause takes part in the bridging
repetition (or ‘head-tail’) linkage, only the support verb gets repeated in the following medial
clause. This is a frequent feature of any narrative, not just of a conversation. An example is at
20.97a. A pause indicates that there is a clause boundary.
20.97a [yi:n   gan kus@m]         [pause] [na-l@-k]                [ya:k]

       remained’
The same sentence without ellipsis is at 20.97b.
20.97b [yi:n    gan kus@m           na:l]                 [pause] [kus@m

       ‘As it went on and on, the night ﬁnished completely. It having ﬁnished, OK, he
       remained’
  The support verb here is uniquely identiﬁable because this is the only one that can occur
with uninﬂected completive aspect (see §17.2)—so there is no need to state it in the main clause.
Neither is there any need to repeat the complement of the support verb since it has just been
mentioned.
  Any support verb can be omitted in the same way. We recall, from 17.39–40, that a nominal
m@k@m@k ‘silent’ takes a support verb r@- ‘sit’ or t@- ‘stand, be’. In narratives of any kind it
often occurs on its own, without a support verb, as in 20.98a:

  A version without ellipsis is at 20.98b:
20.98b [ada                           da-na-d]                  [m@k@m@k

       ‘He went down, (being) silent’
   This is the only type of ellipsis pervasive in any type of discourse.
   A lexical verb can be omitted from clauses with the generic completive napa- (see §18.9)
if understood within the given context. The fact that the child had ﬁnished staying there is
understood—there is nothing else the child was supposed to do after he’d been put there. The
elliptical clause is underlined. Its unelided form would have been kwa-n napa-d@-k (stay-seq
compl.vb-3masc.sg-compl.ds).

      having put her by carrying down), OK, after he’d completed (staying there), we take him
      and put him (there) carrying (him)’
Switch-reference (diﬀerent subject marking in the clause with napa-) helps track the referents.
Note that this is an example of a mismatch in gender agreement (see §5.2.2). The masculine
child is small, and so is referred to with the feminine form of the demonstrative; but it is male,
and so is cross-referenced with the masculine singular on the verb.
   Even a part of a ﬁxed expression can be omitted, if the speaker chooses to do so. As can be
seen from the endings of the three texts at the end of this grammar (T1.35, T2.69, and T3.53),
when a story ﬁnishes, it ‘goes inside the base’. One very long story that the speaker chose to
tell several times ended with:
20.100a gabu-maj           wula-d                         aka
        traditional-story come.inside-3masc.sgbas.p dem.prox.react.top+fem.sg
        ‘The (long) traditional story is over’ (lit. goes inside)
  What he could have said, had he not chosen to be elliptical, is:

        ‘The (long) traditional story is over’ (lit. goes inside the base)
550     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices   Such omissions are indicative of speakers who are less careful in how they lay out their
narratives. And it is perhaps not a coincidence that speakers who tend to be elliptical are not
among the most eloquent orators. That is, Manambu discourse presents a curious combination
of both explicitness and ellipsis. This is comparable to the structure and use of the lexicon—
which also combines a high degree of precision with the ever-present option of using a generic
term. This is the topic of our next chapter.
         21         Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexicon
Throughout this grammar we have dwelt upon the semantic content of various word classes,
including nouns (§4.1.2), verbs (§4.2.2), the two classes of adjectives (§4.3.3), and adverbs (§4.4).
This chapter focuses on a number of salient features of the Manambu lexicon in general.
   Speakers often conceive of their languages in terms of lexicon, putting primary value on
the knowledge of words. In the Manambu tradition, knowledge—viewed in terms of lexicon,
especially the totemic names—is tantamount to monetary riches. In other words, the more
names one knows the richer one is: these include personal names, terms of address, and
denominations of culturally important items owned by diﬀerent clans in general. The issue
of name ownership acquires particular importance at name debates (saki). A man’s oratorical
skill plainly depends not so much on his eloquence but on his knowledge of names—in other
words, nouns par excellence. Knowledge of totemic names belonging to a clan (and of their
‘shadowy’ equivalents: see §22.3) plays a role for both men and women when it comes to songs.
Laments of foiled marriages, namay and sui, are sung by both men and women. The mourning
songs gra-kudi (cry-language) are the prerogative of women. The quality of a song and the
proﬁciency of a singer are judged by the richness of totemic names associated with the clan of
the deceased. Such proﬁciency in a woman is comparable to the eloquence of a male orator
in name debates—except that a good orator wins at a debate (and his clan acquires a name),
while singing a mourning song does not result in winning anything, except prestige and respect.
Multiple ‘names’—each belonging to a diﬀerent clan—create a situation of multiple synonymy
(see §21.5), mostly for nouns.
   The Manambu lexicon is large—especially where nouns are concerned. Very precise distinc-
tions can be expressed. On the other hand, there is a high degree of ‘generality’—one always
has the option of using a generic noun or a generic verb if for some reason one chooses to do
so. This is reminiscent of the organization of Manambu discourse: at the end of the preceding
chapter we saw a curious combination of both explicitness and ellipsis. Manambu also has
a large number of homonyms (partly resulting from a variety of phonological mergers in its
history). A view from other Ndu languages may sometimes help—we return to this in §22.1.
   We start with a discussion of a number of prominent semantic subclasses of verbs (§21.1).
We then turn to the problem of generic, and speciﬁc, notions in the Manambu lexicon (§21.2).
A general noun and a general verb meaning ‘whatever’ and ‘do whatever’ respectively are dis-
cussed in §21.3. Body part constructions and the expression of emotions are discussed in §21.4
(see §17.4 and §20.1.4 for grammatical relations in body part constructions). Their semantics is
discussed in §21.4. In §21.5, we address speech formulae, especially the ways of addressing and
farewelling each other, and touch upon multiple synonyms and name ownership.
                                   21.1 v e r b s e m a n t i c sRoughly the same set of semantic distinctions is coded in the verbal lexicons of all the languages
of the world. Language-speciﬁc concepts tend to include items relating to beliefs, cultural
552     21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexiconpractices, and social organization. The range of meanings of a lexeme can be expected to
vary from language to language. In this section, we brieﬂy summarize a few of the semantic
subclasses of Manambu verbs which appear to be cross-linguistically unusual.
  One such instance in Manambu is ingestive verbs, to do with consuming food or drink—
see §21.1.1. Verbs of perception display rather unusual patterns of polysemy, and may be
considered a special semantico-grammatical subclass within the verbal lexicon—see §21.1.2.
Verbs of speech, one of which was discussed at some length in §19.5, show an interesting
distribution and a number of cross-linguistically unusual diﬀerences one from another—see
§21.1.3.","[573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579]"
"                                    21.3.2 The ‘lazy’ verbThe general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever, happen (whatever)’ is unusual in a number of ways. One
of these is its versatile transitivity.
   We saw in §16.1.3 that it is S=O=A ambitransitive (its transitive use was exempliﬁed in
16.58a, T2.30–1, T2.34, and T3.50; its S=A ambitransitive use appeared in 16.58b and 21.41
above; and its S=O ambitransitive use was shown in 16.58c). If accompanied by a bound
directional, m@gi- has to be telic and transitive. And if used with the preﬁx kay- ‘causative-
manipulative’, kay-m@gi- ‘do whatever with a special eﬀort’ is strictly transitive (see 16.71).
   Its grammatical possibilities were discussed in Chapters 15 and 16. It freely combines with
bound directionals and with directional suﬃxes, and takes part in some verb compounding
structures. It occurs as a second component of a cause-eﬀect compound vya-m@gi- (hit-
do.whatever) ‘hit and break in whatever way’ (15.22), and as a ﬁrst component of compounds
involving -yak@- ‘(do) fully’, as in 15.109 (m@gi-yak@-ku (do.whatever-fully-compl.ss) ‘having
done whatever fully’) and -taka ‘put’, in m@gi-taka- ‘do whatever with respect to extended
surface’ (for instance, peeling pawpaw onto a mat), or ‘do whatever and put it down’ (e.g.
pulling a lever down). It has not been attested in any other compounds, and any attempts to
use it in such structures have been emphatically rejected by the speakers.
   The general verb m@gi- can replace just about any verb of aﬀect and process. It cannot replace
verbs of speech, any verb referring to emotion and mental process, any of the ditransitive verbs,
or a stative verb. Its major function was captured by Teketa:y and Yuaneng who independently
called it, in English, a ‘lazy’ verb—that is, a verb used when one cannot, or is unwilling to,
think of a speciﬁc, more precise term.
   The verb m@gi- is often used as a placeholder for a verb of aﬀect or of happening if the
speaker cannot think of an appropriate speciﬁc verb. An example is at 21.48 (also see 16.58a).
A speciﬁc verb can be supplied: væga-ku (put.inside-compl.ss) was used by the same speaker
as a correction to m@gi-ku:21.48 [ñan wa-d@                      wur@m
      child dem.prox.addr-masc.sg big.string.bag+lk+loc
      m@gi-ku]              [akaytak]
      do.whatever-compl.ss impv+hang
      ‘Having “whatevered” (that is, “put”) this child close to you in the stringbag, carry it (lit.
      hang)’   Speakers are often conscious of the ‘lazy’ nature of m@gi-—we can recall Teketa:y’s instruc-
tions to use the exact verb in its stead, in 16.72 (‘Having “whatevered” this coconut, (it is) to
say like this: “I shall split it by hitting” ’).
   Alternatively, the exact meaning of m@gi- can be easily recoverable from the context, as in
21.41. In stories about orphaned children their parents usually die—so, the verb m@gi- in 21.41
is understood as referring to ‘dying’.
576      21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexicon   A similar example is in T3.43: Oselo tells the story about how he killed all the snakes,
and then states that there would not be any more snakes because he’d already ‘whatevered’
them. Then, he goes on to specify that he’d fully killed them all (vya-yak@-tua-di kill/hit-fully-
1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt), and that he’d killed them by smashing them with a knife (vya-t@pul-tua-
di wali-baga:r kill-‘hit’-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt white.man-knife+lk+instr). A similar example is
16.58b: the context makes it obvious that thunder had ‘struck’ (this is what it usually does).
   M@gi- can be used in lieu of a more complex verbal form, if the type of aﬀect is obvious. A
mother told a little girl to turn her skirt the right way round, using a full verb:
21.49a a-kay-blak@-saki
       impv-caus-be.turned-across.away
       ‘Turn (it) the right way round’ (away from speaker)
  Later on, the same command was repeated using the ‘lazy verb’, with just the directional
speciﬁcation:
21.49b a-m@gi-saki
       impv-do.whatever-across.away
       ‘Whatever it the right way round!’
  This same verb can be used if the speaker decides not to specify the kind of aﬀect, as in
15.109, or the kind of movement involved. In 21.50–1, m@gi- refers to a general movement
inside and up respectively.
21.50 atawa skirt m@gi-saula-ku                       kwau
      thus skirt do.whatever-inside-compl.ss sit+1sgimpv
      ‘I will sit (lit. may I sit) having whatevered (that is, tucked) my skirt underneath’
21.51 a-m@gi-su
      impv-do.whatever-up
      ‘Whatever it upwards!’ (that is, pull the mat upwards)
   Or it can be used if there is no exact verb which would describe the situation, as in T2.30
and T2.31 (‘do whatever to and fro’), T2.34, and 16.58c. In this last example, m@gi- is used to
refer to something adverse happening to the girl’s leg. No one has any idea what exactly had
happened—so the generic m@gi- is appropriate. Here, it could be called a ‘vague verb’, not just
a ‘lazy’ one. A similar example is T3.50 (the last line), l@-k@-m m@gim@gi ma: (she-obl-acc/loc
do.whatever:red neg) ‘there was no way they (people) could “whatever” her (the snake) (lit.
there was no whatevering her)’. Here ‘do whatever’ is a vague way of referring to some kind of
(negative) aﬀect. Jacklyn Yuamali who helped me transcribe this story suggested that m@gim@gi
ma: could be replaced by vyavi ma: ‘no killing’, but then added that the author may have meant
some other way of punishing the snake. Along similar lines, in 21.52 m@gi- refers to something
adverse ﬂies were doing to a wound:
21.52 b@       ji-na,                     sa:r m@gi-lal@k
      already tie-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt ﬂy do.whatever-3fem.sg+because
      ‘She already tied (the bandage) because ﬂies (as a small group) were “whatevering” it’
   The verb m@gi- provides an option of not being precise—this is what makes it ‘lazy’. We saw
above that certain semantic ﬁelds in the Manambu lexicon are remarkably rich, but a general
term is lacking. If the speaker does not wish to specify the exact manner of hitting, breaking,
or mixing, they can use m@gi- as in 15.22, 16.71, and in 21.53–4.
                                                     21.3 General noun and general verb         57721.53 gu-a-wa         m@gi-ta:y           ata

      ‘Because of weight (lit. having been heavy), it (the branch of a mango tree) whatevered
      (that is, broke)’
  M@gi- can also be used as a generic pro-verb in a summarizing function, and can then be
roughly translated as ‘do; act’, as in 21.55:
21.55 [orait] [yanu bla-ku]             [k@dika-n-adika
      alright magic speak-compl.ss dem.prox.react.top+pl-pred-react.top.pl

      ‘OK, having done (lit. spoken) magic, they “whatevered” them (that is, did what was
      described above: eliminated the village), here (the story) ﬁnishes’
   In this function, a more frequent and established alternative is the verb kur- ‘do’,—not
infrequently employed as a summarizing verb, in the sense of ‘this is what (characters) were
doing’, as in 19.87, 18.12, T2.8, T2.13, and T2.16. A similar example is at 21.56; the speaker
used m@gi- as a generic pro-verb (‘this is what they were doing’). When transcribing the
story, Yuamali suggested that it would be more appropriate to use kur-. The clause oﬀered
as ‘replacement’ is in braces.
21.56 [d@ya-k@           yawi aka]                           [atawa

      ‘That was their job (to feed the child), after they’d done that (“whatevered”) (that man
      already grew up’
   The ‘lazy verb’ is much more frequent in informal conversations than in carefully planned
stories. It appears to be rare in ritual discourse: during a full day of name debate, I did not hear
it used once. Speakers who know that they tend to code-switch and are trying to avoid this are
likely to frequently use m@gi- instead of Tok Pisin verbs. This is the reason why m@gi- occurs
in Texts 2 (three times) and 3 (twice): both speakers are proﬁcient story tellers, but, similarly
to other men, especially ‘big men’, they tend to use a fair bit of Tok Pisin. This was their way
of avoiding a Tok Pisin term. The following example illustrates such auto-repair fortunately
captured on a tape:
21.57 du bagarapim, ka!                   du m@gi-da-l
      man hurt         dem.prox.fem.sg man do.whatever-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘They hurt the man (Tok Pisin), no!, they “whatevered” the man’
  We now provide a brief comparison of the general noun and the general verb.
578      21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexicon   21.3.3 Similarities and diﬀerences between the general noun and the ‘lazy’ verbThe general verb m@gi- shares some similarities with its nominal counterpart, ma:gw. The latter
never appears in planned discourse—this can be seen in its absence from the Texts at the end of
the grammar. Both ma:gw and m@gi- can be used as ‘replacement’ noun and verb respectively
if the speaker cannot remember the exact term, or the exact term is obvious from the context.
But while ma:gw can replace any noun, m@gi- can only replace a verb of aﬀect or process.
   The noun ma:gw can be generic—that is, meaning ‘whatever else similar to the referent of the
preceding noun’, and ‘unspeciﬁed type of thing with a particular property’ (examples 21.46–7).
The verb m@gi- in its generic meaning can refer to a non-speciﬁed aﬀect or process. And, unlike
ma:gw, it can have a summarizing function, similar to kur- ‘do’.
   Unlike ma:gw, m@gi- is never used as a pause ﬁller, and never occurs uninﬂected (which is
consistent with its being a regular verb).
   The examples above may create an impression that m@gi- often refers to negative actions or
events. But this is not always the case, as can be seen in 16.58a,16.58d, 21.49b, and 21.55–6.
The general verb m@gi- is a versatile device which oﬀers speakers an option of being vague, and
also highlights the role of context in Manambu discourse.
   21.4 ‘ b o dy’ i n t h e e x p r e s s i o n o f e m o t i o n s a n d m e n ta l p ro c e s s e sLanguages of New Guinea—and of all over the world—utilize body part expressions to
describe emotional states and mental processes (see Priestley 2002 for body parts and emotions
in Koromu, a Madang language, and Lindström 2002, for body parts in expressing emotions in
Kuot, the only non-Austronesian language of New Ireland). Body parts ‘chosen’ for expressing
emotions vary from language to language. Manambu employs nine such items. We discuss them
one by one, and then brieﬂy look at polysemous extensions of a few other body parts.
I. Stomach, ya:l, appears in the expression for ‘anger’, ya:l gra-, lit. ‘stomach cry’ (see
20.35a–b). This is a body part construction (§17.4), and the experiencer could be cross-
referenced or not, depending on its prominence. This expression is synonymous with the Tok
Pisin bel hat (belly hard), illustrated in 21.58a. This is an instance of lexical parallelism, which
involves native and borrowed forms appearing together (see Hajek 2006; Aikhenvald 2006b
and forthcoming c):
21.58a [d@ bel hat ya:l]                      [ya:l     gra:l]
       he belly hard go+3fem.sgbas.p stomach cry+3fem.sgbas.p
       ‘He is angry (lit. his belly is hard), he is angry (lit. his belly cried)’
   The term ya:l is used as a body part term, as in 21.58b, where it means ‘stomach’, and in
7.16 (yala-wa t@- (belly+lk-com stay) ‘be pregnant’).
21.58b [ya:l kag@l] [yi-k-na-ñ@n]
       belly be.sore go-fut-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘If your stomach is sore, will you go?’
Its other metaphorical extension is to do with ‘belonging to one womb’, that is, sharing
maternal relatives: ya:l nak (belly one) is the term used to refer to one’s maternal kin. Saying
ya:l r@-dian (belly sit-1plbas.vt) ‘we sit in one belly’ is a way of stressing ‘uterine’ connections
across clans referring to each other as ‘sisters’ children’ (also see 21.3a). This type of link
prohibits sexual relations between people (see Harrison 1990a: 34). Then ya:l is treated as
                                                                             21.4 ‘Body’       579an inherently locational noun (and thus does not have to be overtly marked for the locative
case: §4.1.2).
II. Blood, ñiki, is used to describe the feeling of being reckless, in the expression ñiki yas@-na
(blood be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.np), as in 4.26d, ‘feel reckless enough to be going to die’
(that is, to risk one’s life in a stupid way). This same term, ñiki, is also used metaphorically to
describe matrilineal links, as in amæy ñiki lagu-da-dian (mother blood pull-3plsubj.p-1plbas.p)
‘mother blood is pulling us (together)’ (also see Harrison 1990a: 34).
III. Bone, ap, has a broad meaning of ‘strength, strong, main’, as in ap-a-s@ (bone/main-lk-
name) ‘main name’, ap-a-du (bone/main-lk-man) ‘chief, head of the place or institution’, and
ap-a-t@p (bone/main-lk-village) ‘main village, Avatip’. A very thin person would be described
as ap-a-ka-ap (bone-lk-int-bone) ‘very thin, bony’ (see Table 4.3).
   The construction ap t@- is inherently polysemous. If we are talking about a ﬁsh, it will be
understood as ﬁsh which is full of bones. If we are talking about a person or a piece of wood,
it would imply that the person is strong, and the wood is hard, as in samasam-a ap t@-na-d-@
mi (a.lot-lk bone/strength ‘stand’/have-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk wood) ‘very hard wood’.
The opposite, ap ma: t@, with the negator ma:, would mean ‘be weak or meek’ (of a person),
‘be soft (of a piece of wood)’, or ‘have no bones’ (of a ﬁsh). In idiomatic collocations, ap
has an implication of ‘resistance’, as in wun-a ya:l ap taka-na (I-lk+fem.sg belly bone put-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I have no appetite’ (lit. my belly puts bone), and in ap krap@-na-wun
(bone lift-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I put up (with something)’ (lit. I lift bone). (Whether the
same root appears in apan ‘old (male)’ and apau ‘old (female)’ is an open question. The form
apar, as in apar ñan ‘main person’, may well be related to ap.)
IV. Skin, s@p, is a term referring to bodily and emotional feelings of fatigue and being fed up,
especially in body part constructions, e.g. s@p ji-na (skin tired/fed.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt)
and its synonym s@p sakwi-na (skin tired/fed.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt). The expression s@p
wiyaw na:d (skin light.and.dry be:nat+3masc.sgbas.vt/p) means ‘be relieved, as if a burden
had been taken oﬀ the soul’. In contrast, s@p væt yi-na (skin heavy go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt)
means ‘having diﬃcult thoughts or emotional diﬃculties, feeling physically tired or unwell’. S@p
yaga- (skin be.afraid) means ‘be scared, timid’. The expression s@p kui- (skin give.to.third.p)
means ‘be used to’.
   This same term often refers to body (as in T2.50 and T3.49, glossed as ‘skin’), e.g. s@p s@lk@-
(skin/body diminish) ‘lose weight’. In T2.56, s@p v@- (skin/body see/experience) is a euphemism
for sexual intercourse. Most bodily feelings are experienced through s@p, as in s@p bwuyabwi na-
na (skin very.hot be.nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘skin is very hot’ (to say that the experiencer
is hot), or s@p kuku na-na (skin lukewarm be.nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘skin is lukewarm’
(to say that the experiencer is just warm enough). S@p can be used as a descriptor of a person:
r@k-a-s@p (dry-lk-skin) implies ‘old person’. Also see 21.72, with s@p used to enquire about a
person’s well-being.
   The formation s@p-@-ka-s@p (skin-lk-int-skin) means ‘skinny (of a person), thin (of a piece
of wood)’, and also, with a spatial extension, ‘ﬂat’.
V. Head, ab, may refer to ‘thinking’ or ‘understanding’: ab ma: t@ (head neg stand/have+neg)
means ‘he/she/they are stupid, do not think’. We can recall, from §7.4, that aba:k t@-
(head+lk+dat be/stand/have) means ‘be not quite right in one’s head’.
VI. Ear, wa:n, has an overtone of ‘aural attention’ and also ‘understanding’, as in wa:n t@-
(ear have-) ‘listen, pay attention’, or its synonyms wa:n taka- (ear put-) and wa:n kui- (ear
580      21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexicongive.to.third.p) (see §21.1.2). This is especially obvious in commands which have a telic reading,
such as 21.25 ‘obey, listen!’, literally, ‘ear listen’. (This is similar to the extension of ‘ear’ in other
Papuan languages, e.g. Karawari (Lower Sepik family: Telban 1998: 56–60).) This same term
typically refers to hearing as a human capacity, e.g. wa:n t@ p(@)- (ear be.closed) ‘be deaf’.
VII. Eye, m@l, has an overtone of ‘visual attention’, for instance, in commands m@l ap! (eye
impv+see) ‘look!’ and statements like m@l ma: v@ (eye neg see+neg) ‘she/he/they is/are not
paying attention’ (see §21.1.2). The term ‘eye’ typically refers to vision, as in m@l kus@- (eye
ﬁnish-) ‘be blind’.
VIII. Breath, ya:p, can refer to ‘rest’, as in 21.59, and also ‘worry’, as in 21.60 (used to describe
young cassowaries playing around with nothing to worry about):
21.59 kwasa          ya:p ada
      little+fem.sg breath sit.impv
      ‘Have a rest, give it a rest’
21.60 agwa ya:p s@-da-k@k@k
      what breath plant-3pl-purp.ds
      ‘Why should they worry and think about things?’
  An example of ya:p meaning ‘breath’ is in T3.50 (Oselo was squeezed by the snake to such
an extent that he could not breathe). This same term ya:p is used to refer to asthma (as in
19.17b), and to any breathing-related disease (including angina).
IX. Mawul ‘something inside something else, bone marrow, core, pith (of a tree)’ is the major
body part associated with emotional and mental states. (A phonetic variant is m@wul; it is
occasionally translated as ‘liver’; an alternative and preferred term for ‘liver’, ‘spleen’, and also
‘lung’ is wur@pi; see Lindström 2002, on a similar polysemy in Kuot.) Mawul may roughly
correspond to ‘mindset’, as in suguya-mawul ma: t@ (help+lk-‘inside’ neg have+neg) ‘she
does not have a mindset of helping (people)’, suku-mawul (carve-‘inside’) ‘mindset of a carver,
patience’. A compound wuk@-mawul (hear/listen-‘inside’) refers to instinct, or thinking. One
‘thinks’ or ‘worries’ in one’s mawul, as in mawul wuk@-na-wun (‘inside’ hear/listen-act.foc-
1fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I am thinking, worrying’, and also in 14.86 (mawul wuk@-tukwa inside worry-
proh.gen) ‘don’t you worry’. Mawul can also refer to liking, as in m@wula ja:p (‘inside’+lk
thing) ‘whatever one likes, things to one’s liking’—see 21.61, a statement about the shopping
centre in Maprik:
21.61 a    [Maprika:r       yi-na-di]              stoam m@wula
      then Maprik+lk+all go-act.foc-3plbas.vt store+loc ‘inside’+lk
      ja:p yapi-na-di
      thing buy-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Those who go to Maprik buy whatever they like’
   If something is taken in and remembered, it ‘stays’ in the mawul, as in 19.28 (m@wula:m
kwa-). The collocation mawul kwa- can also mean ‘like’, as can the expression mawul taka-
(‘inside’ put)—see 21.62 which contains three synonymous expressions, one of them a borrow-
ing from Tok Pisin:
21.62 agwajap@k             laiki-na-d@m@n                mawul
      what+thing+lk+dat like-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt ‘inside’
      taka-na-d@m@n                 mawul kwa-na-d@m@n
      put-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt ‘inside’ stay-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘What (thing) do you like, what appeals to you, what do you feel like?’
                                                                             21.4 ‘Body’   581  Another alternative would be vyakat-a mawul taka- (good-lk ‘inside’ put), ‘like, enjoy’.
The expression mawul taka- can also mean ‘think, put one’s mind to something’. Or, in an
appropriate context, it can refer to an action performed willingly, as in 21.63a.
21.63a mawul taka-n kwatiya-k-na-di
       ‘inside’ put-seq give.to.nonthird.p-fut-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘They will give me (the ancestral words) willingly’
  A synonym is 21.63b—an action performed willingly is performed with ‘light’ mawul:
21.63b mawul wiyau            na-n         kwatiya-k-na-di
       ‘inside’ light.and.dry be.nat-seq give.to.nonthird.p-fut-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘They will give me (the ancestral words) willingly’
   Secrets, including secret knowledge, ‘sit’ in the mawul, as in m@wula:m r@-na-di ja:p
(‘inside’+lk+loc sit-act.foc-3plbas.vt thing) ‘things which stay unspoken’. If people agree,
they are said to have one mawul: mawul nak t@-na-di (‘inside’ one have-act.foc-3plbas.vt) ‘they
agree, are of the same mind’. ‘Opening up’ one’s mawul, mawul kaja-, refers to the process of
educating children and ‘opening them up’ for socialization. The same expression is used to
describe breaking open the husk or the rind of a fruit, exposing the soft ﬂesh inside.
   ‘Internal speech’ and thoughts are often phrased as m@wula:m wa- ‘say in the inside’, as
shown in §19.5.6 (example 19.66). Mawul may be associated with fond memory and nostalgia,
as in 21.64a–b:
21.64a m@wula:m        wuk@-n           r@-k@-bana
       ‘inside’+lk+loc hear/listen-seq sit-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘We will remember and miss (you)’ (lit. ‘we will sit listening in our inside’)
21.64b [yi-k@-gura]                        [ñan-a           mawul
       go-fut-2plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt we-lk+fem.sg ‘inside’
       kray-k@-gura]
       take-fut-2plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘When you go, we will miss you’ (lit. ‘you will carry away our inside’)
 In 21.65, Kawidu indicated that his thoughts were with R. M. W. Dixon, whom he’d never
met, but toward whom he had developed warm family feelings:
21.65 wun-a         mawul d@-k@-wa         t@-na
      I-lk+fem.sg ‘inside’ he-obl-com ‘stand’-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I keep thinking about him’ (lit. ‘my “inside” is with him’)
  Mawul often appears in body part constructions, such as mawul war- ‘be excited, develop a
desire for’ (lit. ‘ “inside” go up’) illustrated in 14.87a–c and 21.66—a comment on Kerryanne’s
spontaneous rush to perform a household chore:
21.66 l@ mawul war-kwa-na                            væs kap@k
      she ‘inside’ go.up-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt grass cut+purp.ss
      ‘She typically develops a desire to cut grass’
   Depending on the context, mawul war- can mean ‘get angry, annoyed’. Either mawul or the
experiencer can be cross-referenced on the verb, as is typically the case in such constructions
(see §20.1.4). If it is in the object function, mawul is never case marked. It is never cross-
referenced on the verb either: but this may be the eﬀect of its feminine gender since the
feminine gender in Manambu is formally unmarked (see §5.1.2), e.g. mawul n@ma kui- (‘inside’
big+fem.sg give.to.third.p) ‘be happy’.
582      21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexicon  Mawul may appear to be agentive: wun-a mawul ata wa-na (I-lk+fem.sg ‘inside’ then say-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘my inside says thus’ refers to a decision-making process. An alter-
native expression, also with mawul, is mawul kur- (‘inside’ do/get) ‘make a decision, make up
one’s mind’, as in 21.67:
21.67 [ [kuprap wa-tua-d-@                          ñan] [wa-ku] ]
      bad         say-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.p-lk child say-compl.ss
      [l@-ka                             mawul kur-l@-l]
      she-obl+fem.sg+dem.dist.fem.sg ‘inside’ do/get-3fem.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘She decided that she had ruined the child’ (lit. ‘this is a child that I have ruined, having
      said this, she had decided’)
   An example of mawul in S function in a fairly idiomatic construction is in 21.68. The speaker
hears people calling her and suspects that something must have happened to her husband (who
in fact had been attacked by a crocodile):
21.68 wun-a-k@            mawul ata-n         draku-l
      I-lk-obl+fem.sg ‘inside’ then-pred unglue-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘It was then that I had a presentiment’ (lit. my ‘inside’ unglued)
   A synonymous expression is wun-a-k@ mawul aka draku-n waku-na (I-lk-obl+fem.sg ‘inside’
dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg unglue-seq go.out-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I have a presentiment’,
lit. ‘my “inside” goes unglued’.
   Having a good mawul (vyakat-a mawul) implies being good-hearted and even-tempered.
Having a bad mawul (kuprap@ mawul) implies having a bad temper and a nasty character.
A way of saying that a person is happy is mawul rakrak ta:d, lit. ‘ “Inside” became happy’.
Saying mawul tugwam na-na (‘inside’ clear be.nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) means that one has
a clear idea of something. And if mawul feels hot (mawul kuku na-na (‘inside’ hot be:nat-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt), the person feels excited and potentially ready to ﬁght. If a person
feels injured or upset, this is phrased as mawul pukam na-na (‘inside’ rot+compl be:nat-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘The inside has rotted’ (or mawul puka-na ‘the inside rots’) (a synonym
is mawul p@ka-na (lit. ‘inside’ rot-act.foc+3fem.sg.bas.vt) ).
   An alternative to saying ya:l gra-na (stomach cry-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) for being angry
is mawul ya:l gra-na (inside belly cry-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt). (According to Harrison 1993:
101, ya:l in this expression is a synecdoche for mawul; this is a matter of interpretation.) Here,
mawul appears as a bona ﬁde location of an emotion.
   And someone who has no sense is said to have no mawul (mawul ma: t@). For those who are
stupid, mawul does not ‘hear’, or ‘listen’ (see §21.1.2, B). A speaker described himself as having
been young and stupid, and not interested in learning the Manambu traditional lore:
21.69 tayir wun mawul ma:n wa:k
      before I     ‘inside’ neg hear/listen+neg
      ‘Before I was stupid’ (lit. I inside did not hear/listen)
  A parent scolding a disobedient child would use a similar expression:
21.70 m@n-a                 mawul ma: wa:k            kwam
      you.masc-lk+fem.sg ‘inside’ neg hear/listen+neg crazy
      t@-na-d@m@n
      stand-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘Are you stupid? Are you crazy?’
                                                                             21.4 ‘Body’       583   Harrison (1993: 98) reports that ‘an orator disputing in debate with a political rival’, may
say the same thing.
   This brief discussion does not exhaust the wealth of expressions involving mawul. Other
body part terms occur in a limited number of expressions to do with emotional, physical, or
mental states. In contrast, the number of expressions in which mawul occurs is open-ended,
and often depends on the speaker’s creative ability to produce metaphors. This is a topic for an
extensive lexicographically oriented study.
   Harrison (1990a: 89–90; 1993: 97–8; 106–9; 1990b) analyses mawul as ‘the aspect of per-
sonality’ which he calls ‘Understanding’. Its counterpart and in some respects its opposite
would be kayik which he interprets as ‘Spirit’. The term kayik is polysemous: it refers to image,
picture, reﬂection (in water), shadow (but not shade which is termed la:gw), and nowadays
also photographs, videos, and ﬁlms (see §22.6.2). Painted designs and carvings are referred
to as kayik or m@y-a-kayik (real-lk-spirit/image). When a person dies, kayik leaves the body;
kayik may threaten living people as a ghost does, and may appear as the person’s ‘double’. An
8-year-old girl was afraid of sleeping in her own mosquito net, and when I asked her mother
why, the reply was kayka:k yaga-na (spirit+lk+dat be.scared-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she is
afraid of ghosts’.
   We saw in §13.2 that a traditional blessing can be accompanied by asking the blesser’s spirit
to ensure the addressee is cured if they are sick, and saying 13.20 (‘my spirit (kayik) may the
illness end, may he (the patient) be well’). Kayik is conceptualized as the source of people’s
‘health, growth and vitality’ (Harrison 1993: 106), and sometimes as their ‘inner self’, invoking
of which may be embarassing.
   When giving my consultants money or presents for telling stories or helping me transcribe
them, I was instructed to say ñ@n-a kaykak (you-lk+fem.sg spirit+lk+dat) lit., ‘for your self,
for your soul, for your personal enjoyment’, as a way of making sure this is understood as a
gesture of particular friendship, and not as a payment. A reply would be either agwa kayka:k
(what spirit+lk+dat) ‘for what self/soul?’, or wun kayik ma: t@ (I spirit neg have+neg) ‘I do
not have a soul’—as if mockingly refusing a present. The present was then usually accepted
with obvious gratitude.
   The pattern of polysemy of kayik is remarkably similar to that of mayi in Kwoma, deﬁned
by Bowden (1997: 124) as including: ‘soul (of a person), entity seen in a dream, spiritual
or supernatural power that viviﬁes a ceremonial sculpture depicting a clan spirit’, and also
‘shadow’, ‘reﬂection (in a stream or mirror)’, and picture or portrait. This may be one of the
numerous examples of contact-induced similarities between Kwoma and Manambu discussed
in §22.2.3.
   Returning to the concept of mawul, it is somewhat unusual from a typological perspective.
In many languages of the world, and of New Guinea, emotions and mental processes are
‘located’ in the stomach, liver, or lungs (see Lindström 2002, for Kuot), or ‘heart’ (as in Iatmul:
Gerd Jendraschek, p.c.). According to Laycock (1986), the heart is ‘the seat of emotions’ in
Momoona (Central and South New Guinea) and Foe (Kutubuan), and the ‘lungs’ in Buin
(Bougainville). Tok Pisin utilizes lewa ‘liver’ and bel ‘stomach’. Alternatively, emotions and
mental processes can be located in the ‘insides’, that is, ‘a space inside of something’, as in
Koromu (Priestley 2002).
   An even closer analogy to mawul comes from Karawari (Lower Sepik: Telban 1998: 59): here
the term wambung roughly translated as ‘heart’ denotes the insides of plants, animals, and even
the moon and the sun; and, just like mawul, it refers to the soft pith and the middle of a plant.
And it also applies to sense and knowledge. (A similar term exists in the neighbouring Awiakay,
from the unrelated Arafundi family: Darja Hoenigman, p.c.) The opposition of mawul and
584     21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexiconkayik suggested by Harrison for Manambu is paralleled by the opposition of ‘inside’ and
‘spirit’ in Kawarari.
   Many more in-depth studies of body part expressions in reference to emotions and mental
states are needed before we can make any attempt at explaining why these three unrelated
languages spoken within the Sepik area share their location of emotions and knowledge. For
now, it remains a curious fact.
A word on other body part terms and their semantic extensions. We saw in §19.2.2
that wus ‘urine, penis’ is employed in the term for ‘blood father’, as in kui-wus asa:y
(give.to.third.p-penis father) (also see 19.32). The term kwa:l ‘neck, throat’ is used in the
expression for ‘being thirsty’: kwa:l yasa-, lit. ‘neck be:desire’; and also kwa:l wurd@p-, both
characteristic of the Yambon variety.
   We saw in §8.1.1 that body parts acquire spatial meanings in part–whole constructions. So,
ya:l ‘stomach, belly’ is associated with the ‘inside’, as in yala-wi (belly+lk-house) ‘inside the
house’, and yala-ta:b (belly+lk-hand) ‘the inside of the hand’. And mutam ‘face’ is associated
with the front of any object, e.g. mutam-a-wi (face-lk-house) ‘in front of the house’, mutam-a-
su (face-lk-shoe) ‘front part of a shoe’, kuk@m mut@ma:m (back+loc face+lk+loc) ‘back to
front’. The noun ma:d ‘testicles’ is used to refer to a lower part of, or a location underneath,
an object, e.g. mad-a ya:l (under-lk belly) ‘lower part of abdomen’, na:gw ma:d ‘underneath
the sago’. The word for ‘tail’, g@ñ, is used in the meaning ‘last, non-ﬁrst’, as in g@ñ-a-ta:kw
(tail-lk-wife) ‘non-ﬁrst wife’ (see T2.60; the opposite is amæy-ta:kw (mother-wife) ‘ﬁrst wife’).
The word for ‘head’ has two spatial extensions. It may refer to the top part of an object, as in
ab-a-wa:n (head-lk-ear) ‘top part of the ear’ and ab-a-wuk ‘upper tooth’. Or it may refer to
the edge of something, as in ab-a-gañ (head-lk-last) ‘last of all’, ab-a-tal@k ‘last house’, and
ab-a-war ‘last boundary’. None of the body part terms shows any sign of grammaticalization
as an adposition.
             21.5 s p e e c h f o r m u la e, greetings, a n d fa r ew e l lsSpeech formulae are an important—and frequently neglected—part of the language. They
may be considered marginal from a grammarian’s perspective; and yet they are indispensable
tokens of language knowledge, without which successful communication cannot be achieved
(cf. Pawley 1993). In Manambu, speech formulae—especially those to do with greetings and
farewells—oﬀer a curious combination of the old and the new. We start with a few examples
of Manambu ‘small talk’ (§21.5.1), and then turn to imperatives in greetings (§21.5.2), and
other markers of speech etiquette, including the old greeting k@p@yay and a variety of Western
imports (§21.5.3). In §21.5.4 we brieﬂy look at address terms whose choice depends on clan
membership.","[602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611]"
