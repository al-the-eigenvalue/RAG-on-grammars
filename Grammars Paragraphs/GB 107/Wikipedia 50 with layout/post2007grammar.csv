9.5.1.1. Polar interrogative clauses
          The function of a polar interrogative clause is to ask an addressee whether he or
she believes a particular assertion made by the speaker to be in fact the case (‘yes’) or not
(‘no’).
          In Galo, polar interrogatives are formed according to one of three basic patterns,
all of which are based closely on (i.e., do not involve significant reorganization of) main
declarative clause syntax.
1) tag particles
2) interrogative particles
3) preferred inflections9.5.1.1.1. Tag particles          The simplest and most frequent means of forming a polar question is via one of a
variety of tag particles, all of which occur as enclitics to a main declarative clause (in any
person). Most tag particles represent intonational and/or segmental variants of a
“versatile” particle with the core segmental form (ʔə)i, with correspondingly differentpragmatic implications (described in §13.5.1), and may in turn be supplemented in their
                                         3069H
use by phrasal intonation. The tag particle may directly follow the copula/predicate, or it
may follow any other occurring particles, including interrogative particles (§9.5.1.1.2).
                                                                                 307H
The resulting construction has the overall sense of an assertion whose validity the speaker
wishes to check with the addressee. It and all other polar questions may be answered in
mm ‘yes’ or máa ‘no’, and/or in a repetition of the questioned clause (or some portion

12. Predicate inflections         This chapter discusses predicate inflections. §12.1 is an overview, and discusses
                                                                                    3675H
inflectional subclasses, obligatoriness, order and co-occurrence possibilities and
restrictions. Subsequent sections discuss the major functional classes of predicate
inflections in this order: negation (§12.2), aspect (§12.3) (comprising two subsections on
                                                         367H                367H
primary (§12.3.2) and secondary (§12.3.3) aspectual subtypes) and modality (§12.4). In

12.1.    Overview
         Predicate inflections occur as suffixes to a predicate stem (§10.2). The                   3682H
prototypical site of predicate inflection is the head of a main (= final) predicative clause;
the full range of forms described in this chapter may occur in that environment. A subset
of the forms described below may also occur on the predicate of a dependent (=
nominalized, non-final or adverbially subordinated) clause; these possibilities are
discussed in the context of dependent clauses in §15 and §16, and are not discussed at any
                                                                      368H                  3684H
length in this chapter.
         Predicate inflection in a main predicative clause is to a great extent obligatory in
Galo. Although it is sometimes possible in casual speech to hear a final predicate which
consists only of a derived predicate stem (with the inflection seemingly ellipsed), such
utterances are extremely rare in my corpus; the overwhelming majority (> 99%) are
overtly inflected (see also §10.3).
                                 3685H
         The majority of predicate inflections occur alone (i.e., they do not co-occur with
other predicate inflections), and license a final predicate. Predicate inflections which are
capable of licensing a final predicate are described as Primary predicate inflections in this
work. Examples are in (605)-(606).

different functional subclasses; for example, Irrealis -rə́, a modality suffix, may co-occurwith Negator -máa, a polarity suffix (607). In this case, ordering is fixed, not free (608).

occur together with other predicate inflections; they cannot themselves license a final
predicate. Such forms are described as Secondary predicate inflections. The most
commonly-used Secondary predicate inflection by far is Completive aspectual suffix -kú‘CMPL’ (609)-(610).

       3.SG            ascend-CMPL       Secondary predicate inflections sometimes exhibit unusual ordering. For example,
although Completive suffix -kú always follows the Irrealis suffix -rə́, as in (609), it
                                                                              3692H

The ability of -kú to precede some primary predicate inflections and follow others leadsto different ordering possibilities when those primary inflections co-occur – and
corresponding differences in Completive aspectual scope (612)-(613).

                                                                                        3697H

Negator -máa is treated as a distinct form inasmuch as it may license a final predicate by                                                570
suffixing to a bound verb root, whereas the identified cognate forms are grammatical
words.
           Semantically, a predicate in -máa is inherently unspecified for anytemporal/aspectual value, unless it is further marked by an aspectual suffix of some kind
(cf. (606)-(607) above). In a discourse context, the aspectual value of a clause marked
    370H     3701H
only in -máa is inherited from a previous aspectually-specified clause, or else is inferredbased on temporal expressions or other contextual factors. In (614), the inferred
                                                                  3702H
perfective value of the negated predicate in káa- ‘have/exist’ is derived from thepreceding, thematically-related clause which is marked in Perfective -tó.(614) kocarí əkə̀ akên-âɲi gò rətó. ɲíi kəbə̀ kaamá.

           Although unspecified for an aspectual value, clauses in -máa tend to have adefault realis interpretation. In a clause describing some hypothetical or potential future
negative state of affairs, an irrealis marker is most often present, as in (615).
                                                                          370H

7.3.1.2. Functions
                 jə̀(ə) occurs as noun phrase or genitive phrase head only (it has no capacity to
        modify another nominal). In-situ use in interrogative clauses is rare but attested, as in the
        rhetorical question in (180). More commonly, content questions in jə̀(ə) are expressed as
                                    2584H
an interrogative cleft/focus construction (181).            258H

                 jə̀(ə) takes on indefinite sense in negative polarity clauses when occurring in-situtogether with Additive particle cìn (177). Indefinite use of jə̀(ə) in positive polarity
                                                    2586H
clauses is very rare, seemingly due to the existence of the competing, dedicated indefinite
        pronoun of person ɲíi (§7.3.2). Limited use of jə̀(ə) in an indefinite positive sense is found
                                            2587H

construction is, roughly, that the identity of the mentioned referent is possible for the
speaker to know, but that the speaker either does not know it because he is not interested
        in knowing it, or perhaps does know it but is not interested in disclosing it (see also
        §13.2.2.9).

7.3.2. Pronoun of person ɲíi ‘someone/somebody’       Indefinite pronoun of person ɲíi is employed in one of two contexts (which indeedmay be two sides of the same conceptual coin). In the first context, the speaker believes it
impossible to know the mentioned referent’s identity (183).

7.3. Interrogative and indefinite pronouns
        The forms discussed in this section are all available for use as interrogative
pronouns, standing for the questioned constituent of a content interrogative clause.
Content interrogative clause formation is discussed from a general perspective in §9.5.1.2.
                                                                                       2573H
Many of the forms discussed below are also available for use as indefinite pronouns in
positive and negative polarities, with senses like ‘something’ and ‘nothing’. The
interrogative or indefinite sense of a pronoun is in most cases determined by the syntax of
the clause in which it appears, together with marking by various clausal particles and,
sometimes, intonation. Very broadly speaking, interrogative force is most often obtained
through interrogative pronominal use in a cleft/focus construction (§9.4), while indefinite
                                                                            2574H
sense is obtained through in-situ use of a pronoun in construction with an appropriate
particle. However, there is much less regularity to the interrogative/indefinite alternation
found in Galo than exists in many other Asian languages; in what follows, we will to
some extent be required to take a case-by-case approach.","[333, 334]"

possessed may take a variety of pragmatic and relational markers, according to their
construed referential values and the polarity of the clause. In positive polarity clauses,
notionally possessed noun phrases tend to take either topic marking, as in (897), or, more

existential possession construction – in which the possessor NP is expressed as a pre-core

expressed as a phrase-internal modifier of the possessed NP (i.e., “my dao doesn’t
exist/isn’t here”). However, since definite/known referents (such as a possessed entity)
are not generally zero-marked in Galo (§14.2.1.1), in practice the latter interpretation
                                          4318H
would be disfavoured. Topic-marking of the possessed NP (generally not a possibility in
an existential possession construction; see above) causes the expression to be understood
unambiguously as a simple existential, and the genitive possessor to be understood as a
phrase-internal modifier (902).4319H

14.2.2.1.1.2.        Inalienable possession
              In the Inalienable possession construction, a notional possessor is expressed as a
pre-core topic and a notional possessed is expressed as subject. In this construction, the
notional possessed NP must denote some inalienable property or appendage of the notional
possessor, such as a body part; it may not be a kinsperson/relative of the possessor. The
possessed subject is usually unmarked, but may also be topic-marked in əə; in the lattercase, the sense is contrastive (i.e., ‘my head (not my leg)’). Unlike in an existential
possession construction, in which the possession relation is expressed by the predicate
káa- ‘have/exist’ (§14.2.2.1.1.1), in an inalienable possession construction various
                          4320H
predicate types may head the clause, all of which express a function of the subject
(notional possessed). The possessor-possessed relation thus seems to be inferred as a
function of the construction; genitive marking of the possessor causes it to be understood
as an internal modifier of the subject noun phrase, hence a simple clause and not (strictly
speaking) an instance of the inalienable possession construction (903)-(904).
                                                                         4321H   432H

9.3.4. On the probable historical origin of the copula construction in a verbless
                clause
                It will have been noted that the Imperfective copula is homophonous with Topic
marker əə, an article which itself seems to derive from an anaphoric/addressee-proximate        demonstrative (§14.2.1.3). It seems likely that the copula construction as it has been
                           302H
described above derives from a verbless clause in which the VCC constituent is marked for
definiteness/identifiability via Topic marker əə, or a common historical source form. 198                     197F
        As was noted in §9.3.1, a Verbless clause complement can under no circumstances be
                                  3024H
        marked as a topic, nor can an Imperfective copula complement be marked by a
        demonstrative or individuator go. Thus, if we consider the range of pragmatic marking        available to appositive clause complements in Galo, we find the following distribution
        (Table 9.4).
        3025H
Clause type                Ø go əə                         DEM

Imperfective copula clause - - x                             -
Table 9.4 – Distribution of pragmatic marking types among appositive clause complements
Accordingly, we might view the emergence of the Imperfective copula construction as in
(361).

      ‘He is my friend.’                However, in light of the ongoing complementary distribution expressed in Table        3027H
9.4, is it certain that the development represented in (361) has in fact occurred? Might an
                                                                    3028H
        Imperfective copula clause not still be analyzable as a verbless clause?
                There are two primary arguments against the latter analysis, and in favour of the
        identification of distinct imperfective copula clause and verbless clause types. The first is
        that, as was noted in §9.3.2, not only nominals/NPs but also adjectives may occur as a CC
                                          3029H
constituent. Adjectives cannot occur as a VCC constituent under any circumstances (i.e.,
taking any of the other types of pragmatic marking available, including zero), nor can
198
           Demonstrative → Copula is of course a well-attested grammaticalization path (Heine and Kuteva 2002);
        within Sino-Tibetan, it is found in Mandarin Chinese 是 shì.
                                                            429
they, in general, occur as a noun phrase head in any other context in Galo. 199 The second     198F
is that Imperfective copula əə forms a paradigm with Perfective copula ee, in many if notall of their respective functions. Thus, although it seems quite likely that the emergence of
an Imperfective copula from a verbless clause construction was recent, and has left many
distributional regularities of the source construction in its wake (some of which may
translate to distributional irregularities in the modern constructions, such as the differing
positions of negation; see §9.3.3), evidence for the development as such would appear to
                                    30H
be sufficient.","[427, 428, 429, 430]"

             jòo ‘what’ is (somewhat informally) used with interrogative force in absence of
any additional marking, or with an appropriate following epistemic particle (196). A 267H
cleft/focus construction in jòo is also possible, and has relatively greater interrogativeforce (197).

             ‘Boini, what are you up to?!’ (KN, OLB4:88)             In addition to standing as a core argument noun phrase head as in (196) and (197),
                                                                              269H                  2630H
interrogative jòo also has the ability to stand in a variety of non-core noun phrasefunctions, which will not be fully exemplified here in the interest of space (see Table 7.9).
                                                                                            2631H

In addition to standing as a noun phrase head, jòo has the ability to stand as a questioningmodifier of a distinct noun phrase head. In this case, the sense is ‘what/which (type of) N’,
       in the sense of questioning the nature of a referent whose overall type is already known
(198). Note that this is a different function from that of Partitive ‘which (member of a
263H

Ablative postposition lokə̀ (see §14.3.6.2).

              In negative polarity clauses, jòo has an indefinite sense in a “Dismissive”construction with Additive particle cìn, as in (199) (cf. §13.2.2.2). 155

Indefinite senses in go ‘IND’ in a positive polarity clause with the sense ‘some(thing)’ are       available when marked by Suppositional particle báa (cf. §13.2.2.9) (200). Finally,
                                                                           263H          2637H

   Indefinite uses of jòo in negative polarity clauses without marking in Additive cìn (as jôo momà!, on the
model of (199)) are also attested. However, such sentences are considered marginal and/or overly casual-
sounding to some of my consultants.

              jòo ‘what’ has taken on a set of extended functions which, while clearly relatable
to its basic function as an interrogative/indefinite pronoun, are not easily describable in
terms of the same set of syntactic features or constructions.
              In a use which may derive originally from an emphatic use of its indefinite sense
in a negative polarity clause such as in (202), jòo is also now available as an interjection-
                                               2639H
       like expression of emphasized impossibility (203). Possibly, the evolution of this function
                                                       2640H
was assisted both by the ability of jòo to occur as a pre-head modifier, as in (202) (cf.
                                                                                     2641H
(198)), as well as by its (prosodically regular, but often emphasized for increased salience)

frequent occurrence with a rising-pitch tone contour – which lends itself naturally to
emphatic extensions.

              A second functional extension of jòo, quite different from the preceding, is that of       a universal pro-form with the basic semantic value ‘etcetera; and all that sort of thing; and
       so forth and so on’. This sense seems to emerge out of the potential indefinite value of jòoin a positive polarity clause, but also seems to depend on being able to occur as the
second member of an appositive construction as in (204).       2643H

Figure 7.1 – Extended functions of jòo ‘what’
               Finally, in an extended function seemingly unrelated to the above-described set of
functions, jòo ‘what’ has probably quite recently developed a clause-final use as a marker        of addressee-admonishment, used often in imperative clauses with an optional following
        particle laa ‘CQ’. According to my consultants, the understood sense is something like        ‘what (is the problem here)’, ‘what (are you prevaricating over)’ or ‘what (ill do you think
        could possibly befall you)’. However, use of jòo(laa) in clause-final position has theprosodic feel of a clause-internal constituent, quite clearly falling within the same overall
intonation contour, and may be developing into a syntactic particle in this function (208)-  2650H
(209).

16.3.1. Coordination by free syntactic operators
16.3.1.1. Conjunctive/additive coordination
           The most frequently-used conjunctive/additive (‘x and (also) y’) coordinator is
okkə́ə (phonetically realized [okkə́ə ~ okə́ ~ ók ~ ʔkə́]). okkə́ə appears to derivehistorically from, and could potentially be argued to remain relatable to, a collocation okə̀‘ANAP.ABL’ + əə ‘TOP’ (with the overall sense ‘from that previously mentioned thing, nowthis:’) (§7.4.6.3).
             4650H
           Typically, okkə́ə conjoins two final clauses, in which the second, focal clause isconstrued as thematically and temporally subsequent to the first, supporting clause. 300            29F
okkə́ə is best analysed as a structural element of the clause it introduces (1056).    4651H
300
      The semantic terms “focal clause” and “supporting clause” are discussed in Dixon (under review).

        Although in examples like (1056) okkə́ə may be said to establish a clear
                                      4652H
relationship of thematic and temporal continuity between two clauses and the events they
code, in other cases okkə́ə functions more loosely as a simple indicator that the speakerhas something more to say and is about to say it. There are no discernible grammatical
constraints in terms of argument structure or TAM-sharing which obligatorily hold
between clauses coordinated in okkə́ə. In (1057), note that none of the three clauses
                                                4653H
coordinated in okkə́ə share any arguments, and that the third clause contains an aspectualspecification which contrasts with that of the first two clauses.

16.3.1.2. Disjunctive/alternative coordination
               Closed disjunctive coordination among Galo interrogative clauses (‘x or y?’) may
be obtained through apposition of structurally parallel clauses with contrasting semantic
values (§16.2.1). This construction may be additionally supported through marking in
                4658H
máa. In the main a Negative polarity particle, and basically homophonous with theNegative polarity predicate suffix -máa (§12.2) and the Negative interjection máa ~ máʔ
                                                    4659H
‘no’ (§13.7.3), in disjunctive function máa marks a polar (closed) alternation between
        460H
two coordinated interrogative clauses. The marked clauses may themselves contrast in
polarity, or they may not. When two clauses are coordinated as in (1060), disjunctive máa
                                                                                       461H
tends to pattern prosodically with the supporting clause, although it is important to note                                                            789

16.5.4.4.1. Quasi-modal of necessity
       A seeming semantic extension of the ‘be passable’ sense of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ gives theclosest fully native Galo equivalent to the Assamese loaned/calqued modal of necessity in
lagí-/lage (§16.6.2.1). As an “Indic-avoidance strategy”, it has high emblematic value as a
            485H
construction, but certainly suffers from relatively much lower frequency of usage than the
Assamese loan/calque, particularly in the foothills (1144).

       ‘I had to push him (to do it).’ (MN, OL23:125)Sentences such as (1144) are understood as having a strong ‘necessity’ overtone, but
                   4860H
possibly have, or are at least potentially ambiguous with, a weaker core sense alike to ‘it
did to x/was considered reasonable/passable to x’. Note also that negation of the matrix
predicate does not indicate lack of necessity, but rather indicates that the subordinated
proposition simply ‘won’t do’ (1145); although necessity to not do something can be
                                       4861H

expressed through negation of the subordinated clause predicate (not shown), it is not
possible to directly negate the semantic ‘necessity’ operator in this construction (i.e., to
state that it is not necessary to do something). This fact suggests that while useful as an
alternative in some cases, this construction has not in fact grammaticalized a true modal
usage, and probably does not represent a true (or realistic) native alternative to the
Assamese-derived modal in lagí-/lage.(1145) aadûu bə́ rɨmà!

subjunctive-like construction has developed through deletion of matrix verb rɨ ̀- ‘do’ in the        sense ‘do (British sense); be passable’. Clearly capitalizing on the hypothetical semantics
        of other types of clausal subordination, a “stand-alone” clausal subordination in this
        condition has the basic sense ‘that [CLAUSE] should be the case’.
               In a few cases, the matrix verb can be replaced with little change in meaning, as in
(1146); a sentence originally uttered with no matrix verb. When asked, the speaker
4862H
responded that he was “saying it short” by leaving the matrix verb off and felt it was
“more correct” to include it; note also the seeming transference of the ‘be necessary’
sense of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ discussed in §16.5.4.4.1.

clause-like status. In (1147), note the occurrence of clause-final hortative particle káa
                             486H
‘HORT.ADVS’, which ordinarily occurs as a predicate enclitic. A consultant later informed

interrogative main clause or cleft/focus construction (188)-(189). It may question spatial

16.3.1.3. Concessive coordination
         Concessive coordination (‘although/despite (that) x, (still/nonetheless) y’) between
two final clauses is marked in daram, a particle for which no plausible completeetymology currently exists. 302 daram occurs as a supporting clause particle/enclitic.

    Although ungrammatical in a stand-alone sense, such an utterance would be possible if it were
understood that an unspecified alternative were implied, but omitted for some reason (perhaps with an
appropriately lilting intonation); it would not be possible to interpret rəkên jaarə̀ dɨɨmá in (1060) as a final
clause in negative polarity.
302
    It is natural to suppose that the first syllable may reflect Contrastive particle da (§13.2.2.4), however the
remainder of the form seems completely obscure.

16.3.1.4. Contrastive coordination
       Simple contrastive coordination (‘x; however/but, y’) is not well-grammaticalized
in Galo. The most frequent functional contrastive coordinations are periphrastic, based on
a repetition of the preceding predicate root or a light verb rɨ ̀- ‘do; happen’, marked with aconcessive coordinating suffix such as -dakkòm or -la(a)cìn (§16.3.2.2) (1063).

16.3.2.1. Conditional coordination
              Although certain other non-final clause types are able to occur with conditional
       implications (§16.4.3.3), the only dedicated Galo conditional coordination is in -boolo – a
                      467H
form which seems to derive historically from a fusion of an earlier nominalizer *bVVplus Locative enclitic lo (§14.3.5). 303
                                     4675H   302F
              Conditional coordinator -boolo occurs as a suffix to a supporting clause predicate       root/stem (verbal or adjectival), which may or may not be inflected for aspect and polarity
(1066)-(1067).

    Jacquesson (2001) claims this construction to be one based on a synchronic nominalization. However, he
neglects to provide evidence to support this claim, which, minimally, should consist of a verb or adjective
in -boo which is capable of standing as a syntactic nominal. In fact, such formations are ungrammatical in
all Galo dialects on which I have conducted research, suggesting that while the nominalization etymology is
probably a good one, it is also probably inaccurate as a synchronic description.

         It is important to note that although -boolo is described here as a conditionalmarker, and the constructions it licenses as conditional coordinations, the
semantic/functional range of -boolo is probably somewhat broader than these terms wouldsuggest; in particular, clauses in -boolo are often introduced not as hypotheticalconditions per se, in the sense of a provisional a which, if met, would lead to b (‘if a (then
b)’), but rather to introduce unreal or counterfactual contexts (whether temporal or
logical) in terms of which a speaker wishes to predicate some fact (as in (1071)). 304                  4687H   30F
16.3.2.2. Concessive and bi-concessive coordinations
         A supporting clause with the concessive sense ‘although; despite; even;
notwithstanding’ is obtained via suffixation of one of two semi-compositional
forms -dakkòm ‘CONC’ or -la(a)cìn ‘CONC’. -dakkòm ‘CONC’ seemingly derives from afusion of the Change of state aspectual inflection -dàk ‘COS’ (§12.3.2.3) with the               468H
Minyong-loaned Additive particle kòm ‘ADD’ (§13.2.2.2). Similarly, -la(a)cìn ‘CONC’ is
                                                                   4689H
derived from a fusion of Non-final suffix -là(a) ‘NF’ (§16.4.2) with native Galo Additive
                                                                                  4690H
particle cìn ‘ADD’ (§13.2.2.2) (1072)-(1073). Note in (1073) that -la(a)cìn ‘CONC’ is
                        4691H       4692H    4693H                         469H
304
    Note that, if the final proto-formative of -boolo is indeed Locative postposition lo, such an etymology
would argue in favour of viewing the general sense of the marker as basically “contextual” rather than
strictly “conditional”.

           Nearly all published descriptions of Tani grammar, whether early or modern and
whether produced by local or international scholars, refer to markers of “present tense”,
“past tense”, “future” and so on (Das Gupta 1963; Simon 1972, and many others).
However, use of the term “tense” in the description of Tani grammar has been criticized
                                               571
by Sun (2003), who claimed on the basis of data from Mising and Na (Bangni) –
representing the Eastern and Western branches of Tani respectively – that what is
referenced by Tani verbal inflections are not tense values at all, but rather aspectual
values. My own Mising and Galo data are fully consistent with Sun’s (2003) analysis.
With reliable supporting data from each major branch of Tani languages, it would seem
that an aspectual system of some kind should be reconstructible to Proto-Tani.
Furthermore, it would seem that the existence of a true tense system in a modern Tani
language is of extremely low probability. I briefly substantiate these arguments here with
respect to the system found in Galo.
        Tense and aspect are both generally understood as systems for referencing or
encoding the temporal structure of a clause, usually by way of some sort of clause-level
inflectional operator, or else by direct marking on the predicate head (Bybee and Dahl
1989). By tense is generally meant a system organized around a given temporal reference
point (usually, the “present”), and in which any reported event or state is obligatorily
marked as temporally prior to or at the reference point (or some similar configuration)
(Comrie 1985). By aspect (in the narrowest and most precise sense) is meant a system for
referencing the internal temporal structure of an event or state from an often large
number of possible viewpoints, but almost always including whether it is construed as
finished or not finished. Often, aspectual systems make use of a temporal reference point
of some kind (such as the time of speaking) but do not obligatorily do so and/or may
freely set temporal reference points which are distant from the present (Comrie 1976).
        Very frequently – perhaps over 90% of the time, although I have not actually
counted – imperfective marking in Galo occurs on the predicate head of a clause with
present time reference, and perfect or perfective marking occurs on the predicate of a
clause with past time reference (with perfective clauses sometimes felt by consultants to
be “further in the past” than perfect clauses). However, it is neither necessary that a clause
with present or past time reference has its predicate marked imperfective or perfective,
nor that a predicate marked imperfective or perfective has present or past time reference,
respectively. For example, compare the Galo sentences in (616) with their English
                                                                3705H
translations. In these sentences, the speaker unmistakably sets his temporal reference
point in the past, precisely at the time when he and his group migrated from the highland
village of daarɨ ̀ɨ down to their present location at hilɨ ̀ɨ village – exactly forty-two yearsprior to the time of speaking. However, the speaker’s construal of most of the events he
reports lacks a specific point of termination (because he still lives in hilɨ ̀ɨ at the time ofspeaking); the corresponding clauses are accordingly marked in the imperfective. By
                                               572
contrast, it is impossible to represent the same temporal structure in English without using
past-tensed verbs.

Table 5.22 – Body sensation/disposition terms
5.2.3.8. Human propensity        I have attested relatively few HUMAN PROPENSITY terms, and those terms which
are attested appear in many cases to be derived by metaphor from PHYSICAL PROPERTY
terms (whether basically nominal or adjectival). For example, alùk ‘depressed; forlorn’ isrelated to the noun alùk ‘burning/irritating sensation’, reflecting an a-prefixation of lùk-‘burning sensation; chili pepper’. Other HUMAN PROPENSITY terms have both nominal and
adjectival uses with basically the same semantic value – one denoting a property and the
other an entity with the property, as peccáa ‘fool(ish)’. However, the majority of HUMANPROPENSITY concepts by far are encoded by Manner predicate derivations – many if notmost of which have adjectivalizing functionality, as mə́ə-kèn ‘think-GOOD/EASY’ ‘happy’or mə́ə-cə́k ‘think-BOLDLY’ ‘bold; straightforward and unhesitating’ (both of which maybe used as adjectives). For further discussion of Manner predicate derivations, see
§11.2.1.
 204H
5.2.3.9. Speed
        Very few SPEED terms are attested. dəmə́ə ‘slow’ is a basic adjective, while -báa‘FAST’ is a Manner predicate derivation with limited adjectivalizing capability. In some
subdialects, a probably recent formation bɨɨbáa (seemingly reflecting bɨ ́i- ‘swell; fill up’+ -báa ‘FAST’) has the generalized sense ‘fast’, although not all speakers use (or evenparticularly appreciate) this word. Certainly, a large number of younger speakers prefer
the recent Indic loan zoldi ‘fast’, which has been borrowed into foothills Galo as anadjective. Degrees of speed are seemingly not lexicalized in Galo, although numerous                                                248
periphrastic modifications of basic SPEED terms are of course possible (including various
adverbial and particle emphatics, and also onomatopoeia; see §13.7.7).

5.2.3.10. Difficulty       DIFFICULTY is not robustly lexicalized in Galo. The single attested term is an
adjectivalizing Manner predicate derivation -kèn ‘GOOD/EASY’, which may have the sense‘good (to do V)’ or ‘easy (to do V)’, according to the semantics of the situation. For
example, dó-kèn ‘eat-GOOD/EASY’ generally has the sense ‘delicious’ (lit., ‘good to eat’),but in a situation in which the relative difficulty of eating a particular kind of food (or
using a particular type of utensil, such as chopsticks) is under discussion, the sense may
be ‘easy to eat (with)’. Difficulty (lack of ease) is expressed by the same form in negative
polarity, as dó-kèn-máa ‘eat-GOOD/EASY-NEG’ ‘not nice to eat’. This situation is basicallyparallel with that of VALUE terms (cf. §5.2.3.5).

handled by coordination of the S argument noun phrase, with reflexive marking on the
predicate (71).

using a deictic demonstrative, of which there is a very rich system in Galo (§7.4).

5.2.4. Verb class semantics and subclassification
5.2.4.1. Overview
        There are fewer verb roots as a percentage of lexemes overall in Galo than may be
typical across languages. The principal reason for this appears to be the richness of the
system of predicate derivations (§11). Although the core semantics of most types of event
                                       209H
– concepts such as ‘speak’, ‘see’, ‘eat’ and ‘make’ – are handled by lexical verb roots in
Galo, many aspects of event/state manner, temporal/procedural structure, degree of
realization and other related concepts which may be lexicalized as a inherent features of
verb roots in other languages are often handled separately by productively stem-
expanding predicate derivations in Galo. This is not an absolute generalization – for
example, there is a very large set of ‘cut’ type verbs in Galo, most of which have
lexicalized distinctions related to manner, result and/or type of entity affected – but it is
fairly noticeable all the same.
        The basic subclassification of Galo verbs is in terms of transitivity, by which is
meant the number of participants for which the event or state depicted by a verb is
underlyingly specified, as well as the semantic roles which are assigned to them. A more
detailed discussion of the overall derivation from verb semantics to grammatical marking
of participant noun phrases at the clause level may be found in §14.1; here we mention
                                                                      210H
only basic lexical-semantic features of verb roots.
        In Galo, verbs may be atransitive, intransitive, transitive or extended
atransitive/intransitive/transitive, as well as ambitransitive (S=A and S=O). Atransitive
verbs do not subcategorize for any obligatory arguments.","[247, 248, 249, 250]"
"        Marking in -pàa is particularly common in negative polarity clauses; in this case,its effect is to indicate that although the activity denoted by the predicate is initiated, its
realization is somehow imperfect or incomplete. In (448), the A argument referent (in this
                                                        32H
case the speaker) has clearly initiated an event of ‘thinking’, but is unable to fully or
completely bring the thought on or about which he intends to think (referent of the
underlying O argument) fully to mind.

11.2.1.4. Argument structure
        The argument structure of a predicate stem expanded by a Manner or Result
derivation may be the same as or different from the argument structure of the head root.
Often, the valence of a transitive stem may be reduced through Manner derivation; in
many if not all cases, this can be viewed as a process of adjectivalization, as discussed in
§11.2.4.2; for example, the Manner derivation -kèn ‘GOOD/EASY’ raises the underlying O
 324H
of a transitive verb to S (deleting the A), as in dó-kèn ‘eat-GOOD/EASY’ ‘good/easy to eat’.",[491]

          A clausal subordination in bə́ ‘SBRD’ closely resembles canonical main clausesyntax. Unlike verbal subordinations, the subject of a clausal subordination (if overt) is in
the unmarked nominative case. Contrast (1126) above – a verbal subordination exhibiting

10.6.   Interruption of the predicate complex        As the above subsections have discussed, there is good evidence for the relative
phonological independence of sub-predicate “words”, but less evidence for their
grammatical independence. This view of the predicate as a basically irreducible syntactic
constituent is to an extent challenged by the ability of certain “versatile” particles
(discussed in more detail in §13.5) to “interrupt” the predicate complex – usually, with an
                               3165H
emphatic function, and always at the boundary of a phonological word. In (408),
                                                                              316H
Emphatic particle (ə)i ́ occurs twice, first at the edge of a temporally-subordinated clauseand the second time “interrupting” the predicate rə́-kú-máa ‘live/exist-CMPL-NEG’ ‘notlive/exist anymore’. Note that *rəkú and *maané cannot be analysed as grammaticalwords themselves, since the predicate overall is ungrammatical here if unsuffixed by -máa(-kú ‘CMPL’ is a Secondary predicate inflection which cannot itself license a grammaticalpredicate word; see §12.3.3.1). Furthermore, né is a clause-final particle which marks the
                       3167H
illocutionary force of the entire utterance (§13.3.2.2.2), and stands in no immediate
                                              3168H
dependency relation to Negative suffix -máa. In (409), (ə)i ́ interrupts the predicate
                                                      3169H
complex at a different point, following the verb stem and preceding all inflections. The
boundary of such grammatical word-internal “interruptions” is conventionally marked
“≡” in this grammar.",[457]
"              Although clausal subordinations tend strongly toward same-subject readings, there
are no grammaticalized lower clause-higher clause coreferentiality constraints in a clausal
subordination unless additional predicate-marking is applied. For example, marked
coreference-constraining “disjunct” subordinations may be found, as discussed in
§16.5.4.3.

16.5.4.1. Co-temporal (-dùu ‘IPFV’, dàk ‘COS’ -máa ‘NEG’)              Clausal subordination in Imperfective -dùu ‘IPFV’ or Negative -máa ‘NEG’ derivesa basically co-temporal clause linkage (1132)-(1133). Often, the subordinated clause can

       ‘Yeah, see I’m just talking without really thinking.’ (MK, LW 023)       The combination of subordinate clause predicate negation and achievement
marking derives an implication of episodic prioricity (i.e., ‘x not yet-achieved-ly, y’ →
‘before x, y’) (1134). Although it does not constitute a direct lexicalization of the concept
              481H
‘before’, this type of adverbial subordination would seem to be most direct means of
encoding the concept ot temporal event-precedence in Galo.

16.5.4.2. Irrealis/prospective (-dó(o) ‘STAT’)       The most frequently-attested type of clausal subordination is in Stative -dó(o)‘STAT’. The basic sense of a subordination in -dó(o) ‘STAT’ is irrealis/prospective: thesubordinate clause contains information which is viewed as non-co-temporal with the
information contained in the main clause, and which may be non-real, hypothetical, or
prospective from the standpoint of the main clause setting. Very often, the sense derived
(possibly by implication) is one of purpose; for example, in (1135), ‘sleeping’ is viewed
                                                               482H
as a prospective activity at the time of ‘divvying-up labour’, and, indeed, is understood as
the purpose for which ‘divvying-up’ is undertaken.","[827, 828]"

1. Introduction1.1. Overview
         The following work is a descriptive grammar of the Lare dialect of Galo, 1 a
language of the Tani branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family which is spoken in
central Arunachal Pradesh state, North-East India. It is the first ever attempt at a
comprehensive description of the grammar of Galo, or, for that matter, of any Tani
language. It is designed to serve three main purposes. First, it is designed to serve as a
partial historical record of the Galo language as it was spoken in the early 21st century.
For reasons that will be discussed, no extant document yet comes close to serving this
purpose. Second, it is designed to serve as a reference for linguists, anthropologists, and
other scholars engaged in comparative language typology, or with other interests in
languages and cultures of the region. Third, and perhaps most importantly, it is designed
to serve as a foundation from which further descriptive, documentary and pedagogical
materials may be developed to aid in the preservation and maintenance of the Galo
language, for the benefit of future generations of Galo people.
         Although the primary focus in this work will fall consistently on the Lare dialect
of Galo, in light of the extreme paucity of documentary and descriptive materials for Tani
languages in general, references will be made to certain other Galo dialects and certain
other Tani languages where possible and relevant to the discussion; this is as much in aid
of situating Lare Galo in typological relation to its relatives and neighbours as it will be –
I hope – in aid of furthering broader linguistic studies in this extremely interesting and
very much neglected area of the linguistic world.
         In this chapter, the following subsections provide a contextual overview of Galo
language and culture (§1.2), followed by a review of relevant works by other scholars
(§1.3), a discussion of the theoretical framework in terms of which this study is conducted
(§1.4) and a description of my fieldwork and analytical methodologies (§1.5). §1.6 and
§1.7 finally discuss conventions and the structure of this work in more detail.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

12.3.3.4. Achievement -dáa       Achievement -dáa is a seemingly quite old and versatile form which is not well-attested as a final predicate suffix. Depending on its position and the overall construction
in which it appears, it may be analysed as having a basically contrastive, repetitive,
recursive, or achievement-oriented sense, and may in fact be able to be analysed in terms
of more than one distinct form. A seemingly cognate particle or particles with similar
functionality is described in §13.2.2.4-§13.2.2.5.

                   As a final predicate inflection, -dáa seems to occur alone only in appositive, semi-idiomatic constructions. The overheard utterance in (657) was later judged by my
                                                                 3807H

In negative polarity predicates, -dáa has a more clearly achievement-oriented sense ‘yet’(658). 234

                   ‘He hasn’t gone/left yet.’ (TR, 9:173)
       When following the Completive suffix -kú, the sense is closer to repetitive (659). Note
                                                                                          3809H
       that the initial [d] geminates in this position, following the irregular process of Initialgemination (§4.1.5.1); the sense and behaviour here closely recall that of the Repetitive
                           3810H
particle §13.2.2.4, however note that in preceding the Negator we can clearly identify this
                    381H
usage as suffixal.

                   ‘Up there...now what was it (called)? I’ve forgotten yet again.’ (TB, OAM 218)Finally, it is possible to find apposed clauses – possibly in an expansion of the
construction type illustrated in (657) – in which two -dáa mentions occur, with the overall
                                           3812H
sense ‘once/as soon as x, y’. It is at present not possible to discern whether the
234
   In the speech of some (mainly younger) Galo, the Achievement suffix may be freely ordered before or
after the Negator, with the same overall sense. However, this mode of speech was repeatedly criticized by
some of my most astute consultants, who viewed this usage as an incorrect reanalysis of the basically
homophonous Manner predicate derivation -dáa ‘SWIFTLY’; i.e., the sense of a differently-ordered (658)
should be ‘he isn’t going/didn’t go swiftly (but he is going/did go)’. I have treated the reanalysed use as
marginal speech in this grammar, however attention should clearly be paid to whether the use continues to
spread, or not.

second -dáa mention represents a second iteration of the Achievement suffix or aniteration of the seemingly cognate Repetitive particle described in §13.2.2.4; what is   381H
certain is that this is a construction-dependent use. It is not possible to utter either of the
first or second clauses in the appositive pairs in (660)-(661) independently.

         All of the forms described in this section are primary predicate inflections, and are
capable of occurring alone on a predicate stem, licensing the grammatical predicate head
of a final clause.","[593, 594, 595]"
"However (as discussed in §16.3.1.2 also) it is important to note that the Negator as a

           It is possible that “double” coordination-marking represents “open” coordination, as though implying
        that still other qualifying referents might yet be mentioned. Unfortunately, data on this point appear mixed,
        and the possibility can at present be neither confirmed nor denied.

negative polarity operator per se does not occur following epistemic particles in modern
Galo; hence on syntactic grounds it is clear that the Disjunctive coordinator and the
Negator are synchronically distinct (141).

attested cases of semantic alternation in my corpus handled by NP-internal head-
coordinations (see §6.2.3). The structure most often returned in elicitation involves a
                      2496H

types – one involving sequential, non-coreferential NPs, in which each NP is marked by an
epistemic particle, and the other in which a disjunctive coordinator marks the alternation
– and a third type, defined as a hybrid of types 1-2 (Figure 6.6-Figure 6.8).

      For example, since ‘Wonderment’ dɨɨ can occur in both declarative and interrogative clauses, but
‘Uncertainty’ pə̀ can occur in declarative clauses only, they are differently subclassified below. However, it
seems equally possible to group them both under a common functional-semantic heading ‘Epistemics’.

         A relatively large and seemingly closed set of forms occur on the periphery of an
argument noun phrase. A small number, including Contrastive da, Recursive (d)da(da)and Additive cìn also have the ability to mark a cleft/focused noun phrase, but others –such as Completive kú and Comparative dèn – lack this functionality. 243 The reason for

   Although it is possible for non-clefting particles to occur within the marked focus of a cleft construction,
they are not themselves clefting particles; instead, a second particle with clefting functionality must follow.
For example, in the sentence [әәm dèn né], [ŋó mèn-dùu-nà]=әә] ‘[ANAP.ACC COMP DECL.ADM]FOC, [1.SG
say-IPFV-NZR:SUB=TOP]TOP’ ‘That (not what you had thought) is what I’m saying’, it is not Comparative dèn,
but rather the Admonitive particle né which stands as focusing particle, licensing the left-dislocation;
without the Admonitive particle, the sentence would be ungrammatical. For further discussion of the
grammar of focus/cleft constructions, see §9.4.
                                                     616
          Argument noun phrase-modifying particles may be subdivided into three major
position classes – Types 1a and 1b, which have the potential to co-occur in an ordered
sequence, and Type 2, which supplants both of Types 1a and 1b (Table 13.3). Uncertainty
                                                                         391H
exists where particles are less-frequently attested and/or where their use is dispreferred by
some speakers; forms with less certain distribution are marked by: (?). An example of
ordered sequencing is given in (708).   3920H

13.2.2.1. Completive kú          Completive particle kú is a clear cognate of Completive predicate inflection -kú(§12.3.3.1); the ultimate etymology of -kú/kú is currently unknown, but almost certainly
  3921H
dates at least to the Proto-Tani stage. Completive particle kú marks noun phrases whosereferents are construed as ‘now’, ‘ultimately’ or ‘finally’ participating in the predicated
event/state, often as their (possibly anticipated) participation marks an episodic boundary,
turning point or termination of a series of events. Completive particle kú often interactswith predicate marking in -kú (709); however, the two forms are non-redundant, and are
                                 392H
thus not reducible to an instance of aspectual concord (710).

13.2.2.2. Additive cìn and kòm       Additive cìn (Pugo sìn) is a common, versatile particle with the basic function ofindicating participation in a predicated event/state ‘also’, ‘as well (as)’ or ‘in addition
(to)’ another known referent (711).

       cìn ‘ADD’ also commonly occurs in the ‘Additive co-participant’ construction, in
which it marks both co-participating referents (schematically, I also went and he also
went; see Conjunctive/Additive coordination in §16.3.1.1). It also quite commonly occurs
                                                    3925H
in a “Dismissive” construction. In this construction, the Additive particle follows an
interrogative/indefinite pronoun in a negative polarity clause, indicate that ‘none’ or ‘not
any’ of a set of qualifying referents in fact participate in the predicated event/state (712).
                                                                                       3926H

pronouns in §7.3.

11.2.5.11.        Comparative -jàa         Comparative -jàa ‘COMP’ is an important form with several related functions. In itsmost basic sense, when marking an adjectival predicate, -jàa has an intensifying value,indicating that the marked property/condition is ‘very much’ true of the subject (568).          3584H

   The only true comparative constructions in Galo are comparatives of discrepancy, as are discussed in
this section. Notional comparatives of equality take the form of a simple intransitive clause, headed by the
adjective ləjɨ ́ɨ ‘similar; same’. Notional comparator and notional comparand are expressed as coordinated
NPs within the subject position (schematically, ‘x and y are similar/the same’).

        -jàa ‘COMP’ may also mark a verbal predicate, with the basic sense ‘rather;instead’, and with similarly different sub-senses or effects depending on the transitivity of
the stem on which it occurs and/or the number of arguments which are overt or implied in
the clause: on an intransitive verbal predicate, use of -jàa ‘COMP’ may indicate that thepredicated event/state is brought about ‘rather than’ or ‘instead of’ any other (implied)
event/state, as jùp-jàa-tó=kée ‘sleep-COMP-IPTV.ODIR=HORT.POL’ ‘sleep rather (than dowhat you’re proposing)’. On an extended intransitive or (extended) transitive predicate,
the sense is more often of E or O being affected ‘rather than’ or ‘instead of’ any other
potential referent, as in (574).

11.2.6.1. Prospective -dée        -dée ‘PROSPECTIVE’ marks an event or state as having a real possibility of comingto pass, in the sense of not being subject to any external constraints (579). In negative
                                                                         360H

        In terms of frequency, -dée most often occurs in nominalizations, where its senseis often closer to future/irrealis; i.e., that the marked event/state will or is expected to
come to pass (581). This may amount to a functional compensation for the relatively
                      3608H
greater set of restrictions placed on occurrence of the Irrealis suffix -rә́ in nominalizedclauses (cf. §15.3.2.2.2).

        ‘Who will be tonight’s cook (i.e., my wife or yours)?’ (MN, OL23:86)
        -dée is also subject to a very unusual ordering constraint which suggests it may be
in the process of a category shift, either to inflectional suffixal or some sort of modal
auxiliary-like status. When occurring in a quadrisyllabic predicate structure, -dée hasbeen observed to preferentially follow the negator, a property usually reserved for
predicate inflections; compare (581) with (582).

                                                                                       3612H

       11.2.6.2. Ability -là(a)              Ability -là(a) ‘ABIL’ refers to the subject’s ability to bring about the predicated       event/state, in terms of skill, knowledge, technical facility, or some more general means
(584); -là(a) ‘ABIL’ most often cross-translates English ‘can’.

       Finally, -là(a) ‘ABIL’ is one of the very few predicate derivations capable ofoccurring with an ellipsed predicate head, albeit in strictly limited conditions. (586) is a361H
possible rejoinder to questions such as (585).

Note in (586) that Phrase-medial truncation applies, despite the fact that -là(a) ‘ABIL’ does
        3618H
not in this case occur in third syllable position. This underlines the seeming fact that a
sentence like (586) can only be contextually derived from a sentence like (585); i.e., -là(a)

‘ABIL’ cannot be straightforwardly used as predicate head in a simple declarative clause.
This topic is discussed in a more general context in §11.1.6.2.

characteristics, some other natural characteristics, or more generally as a result of some
necessary or unalterable conditions that obtain in a particular situation, as in (587).
                                                                                     362H

High certainty jaarûu        In a seeming extension of the superlative use of Certainty rúu ~ rûu whenfollowing -jàa ‘COMP’, a particle expressing ‘High certainty’ jaarûu has been observed tomark noun phrases. Although this may appear to provide evidence for the Particle status
of Intensifier -jàa ‘COMP’ – as well as for the Superlative sequence -jàa≡rûu ‘COMP≡CERT’as exemplified in (832) (discussed in §11.2.5.11), it is important to note that, unlike

jaarûu, -jàa ‘COMP’ cannot occur independently outside of the predicate word. This wouldsuggest that ‘High certainty’ jaarûu may derived from reanalysis of the predicatesuperlative sequence -jàa≡rûu ‘COMP≡CERT’ as a free syntactic operator (833). This
                                                                                 4150H

more common. In this case, although the clause as a whole still has the overall syntactic
form of a copula clause, there is no hint of an equative or attributive sense (unlike most
copula clause types in Galo); rather, the sense is of information being presented as an

which have yet to be fully worked-out. All forms currently attested seem to exhibit
person-based restrictions which may be related to attribution of knowledge. The most
common by far involves predicate nominalization in -nà ‘NZR:SUB’, followed by anImperfective copula əə. The sense is of a strong assertion, as ‘I’m telling you that I knowthis to be the case’. In (1039), the speaker is predicting that he will sacrifice ten mithuns,
                        4605H
an event over which he has direct control; a parallel clause with a third person subject is
not accepted by my consultants (1040).

Non-first person subjects of an inflected Final clausal nominalization in -nà ‘NZR:SUB’ areaccepted only when the speaker has first-hand, experiential knowledge of the matter at
hand. In (1041), the speaker is reporting his friend’s exclamation that a snake was about
         4607H
to bite him; thus, although the snake is in fact the (ellipsed) subject of gàm- ‘bite’, theinformation is asserted as the speaker’s knowledge.

       Backgrounding clausal nominalizations, like Final clausal nominalizations, occur
in both uninflected and inflected forms. Backgrounding clausal nominalizations occur
clause-internally – not as a structural clause constituent – but rather as an aside, generally
providing some background information which the speaker believes will enhance the
main information presented in the clause. However, while Final clausal nominalizations
are structurally copula clauses, and can take either of the Imperfective or Perfective
copulas (§15.3.2.2), Backgrounding clausal nominalizations are instead marked as topics.
          4617H
                                             777
Although the Topic marker and Imperfective copula are homophonous, and probably
share a common etymology (§9.3.4), note that in a Backgrounding clausal nominalization
                                             4618H
        the Perfective copula can not occur (suggesting that this may not, in fact, be a copula-
        headed construction).
                 Backgrounding clausal nominalizations make use of both participant and event
        nominalizations. Participant nominalizations generally give supplementary information
        concerning a particular argument, and occur adjacent to that argument in the syntax. In
(1045), note that despite the relative clause-like structure, and the translation as a relative
4619H
clause in English, it is not possible to add an external head noun in the Galo construction.

nominalizations in -nam, generally to comment on some background event whichsupports the predicate thematically (1046).          4620H

                 “Framing” clausal nominalizations are statistically the most frequent use of any
        nominalization-based construction in my corpus by far; 298 they are generally (possibly
                                                                            297F

           This is certainly due in part to the relatively high concentration of narrative texts in my corpus. Framing
        clausal nominalizations are considerably less frequent in face-to-face conversation, although they do
        occasionally occur.

2006) found commonly in the clause-chaining languages of Papua New Guinea, as well
as elsewhere, Framing clausal nominalizations in Galo very often serve to summarize
preceding events in a discourse, generally by presenting a nominalized repetition or
recapitulation of a preceding predicate, possibly including one or two additional
constituents. The basic function of a Framing clausal nominalization, so used, seems to be
to signal episodic transition, marking the preceding discourse episode as effectively
terminated, and simultaneously serving as a “frame” for the new episode to follow (1047).4621H

rɨ ̀- ‘do’ or ə́m- ‘say; tell’ (in an anaphorically-referring, non-speech-act related function;
see §16.7). Referring only very loosely to preceding events, such constructions are often
     462H
best translated by sentence connectives such as (so) anyway. Framing clausal
nominalizations based on light verbs occur so frequently in narrative discourse that they
appear highly conventionalized, are very often heavily phonologically reduced, and may
well be in the process of lexicalization/grammaticalization as dedicated syntactic clause
linkers (Post under review) (1048).

            (RmR, CC 051)            However, Framing clausal nominalizations are not necessarily recapitulative; that
is, they need neither employ a predicate used in a previous clause nor an anaphorically-
referring “light verb”. Instead, with a semantic value very closely resembling that of a
Backgrounding clausal nominalization – in effect, differing only in terms of syntactic
position and discourse function – a Framing clausal nominalization can predicate a new                                               779

                Hesitation mane is an ubiquitous form of the Assam plains, reflecting Assameseman- ‘mean’ + -e ‘Third person subject’. It is as addictive an expression as may be found
in any language, on a par with American English like and every bit as distasteful to
language purists. Usually translatable via English like, I mean or that’s to say, maneoccurs clause-initially or -finally in Galo of the foothills area, and also as a general
hesitation word. However, unlike native Galo hesitation words such as məráa (§13.7.6),      4105H
mane cannot stand as a “pro-lexeme”. Use of mane is less widespread outside Assamese
contact areas, although it is probably more widespread than many Galo seem to have
hoped (809).

13.5.           “Versatile” particles
                “Versatile” particles form a small, closed set, and are so-called due to their ability
to occur in an especially wide variety of contexts, both constituent-finally and, in some
cases, constituent-internally. Most have a basically emphatic function, and are used to
draw extra attention to certain clausal and/or phrasal constituents. However, most do not
occur as markers of a cleft/focus construction. Some versatile particles have
homophonous and semantically relatable forms in other form-classes; depending on the
analysis, one could either describe such forms as (probably) diachronically related but
synchronically distinct, or else as constituting a perhaps even more versatile class of
particles than is being envisaged here. Although the first of the two approaches is the one
more consistently taken in this grammar, in the interest of descriptive completeness the
full potential distribution of the versatile particles is presented in subsections below
(Table 13.8).

Table 13.8 – Versatile particles
13.5.1. Emphatic, focal, and polar question marking particles with formative i         There is a large set of Galo forms seemingly organized around a basic formative i,whose functions are probably relatable and may ultimately permit reduction (whether in a
synchronic or a diachronic sense) to a basic form (ə)i ‘Emphatic’. Variations, bothfunctional and phonological, would then be viewed as products of syntactic position and
scope as well as, potentially, of prosodic expressivity. At the same time, there is certainly
evidence that form-function specialization either has occurred or is in the process of
occurring, and not all possible phonological shapes seem to be permissible in all syntactic
positions/functions. 252 In what follows, three basic form-function categories are described,
                       251F
with the caveat that a certain amount of formal and functional “spillover” occurs between
them, and may ultimately reflect the existence of an “underlying” relationship of some
kind.
         Emphatic (ə)i ́ occurs as an enclitic to any non-final constituent, seemingly withlocal scope. Its basic function is to highlight or draw additional attention to the constituent,
as though to increase a sense of precision or importance. When marking a noun phrase,
Emphatic (ə)i ́ conveys a sense of ‘precisely (this)’, ‘right (then/there)’ or ‘(this) and
252
   I have asked numerous consultants on numerous occasions whether one form in i is ‘the same as’ or
‘means the same as’ another, and found the range of possible answers to be almost unlimited, and equally
unlimited in their potential for cross-contradiction!

        When marking a predicate, Emphatic (ə)i ́ has the unusual property of occurringwithin the predicate complex, either following the predicate word and preceding any
particles, or else (and more often) interrupting the grammatical predicate word (see §10.6           418H
for discussion of this phenomenon in a more general context). In either case, the position
of (ə)i ́ is always clitic to the left edge of a phonological word – it cannot occur within aphonological word (811)-(812).

    (ə)í occurs with far greater frequency in the speech of Galo living in foothill areas than in the higher
areas, and with far higher frequency in the speech of my female consultants than in that of males. Its usage
is believed by some of my consultants to derive from mimicry of plains languages – a plausible claim which,
however, I have not been able to properly verify. Some of my consultants consider Emphatic particle use or
overuse to be bad form or to constitute low-register speech, although its use is certainly addictive; I have
been personally scolded on several occasions for my unseemly imitation of these patterns!

        Emphatic tag (ə)ì follows predicates, including any and all particles which may beassociated to it. It does not mark cleft/focal NPs. Its basic function is to “check” that the
addressee is following and/or agrees with the speaker. By implication, it usually forms a
polar question which differs somewhat in feel from a polar question in ree (§13.3.3.1);
                                                                                 4125H

case, but is checking with the addressee to make doubly sure (815). ‘Emphatic tag’

particle (ə)ì may occur alone in this function, or it may follow other polar question-forming particles. In (816), use of (ə)ì basically renders the question more “insistent”-

         Semantically, -kú ‘CMPL’ marks an event or state as a point of completion, as thefinal stage of an episode or state of affairs, as a transition point between two contrasting
states of affairs, or as the onset of a state which contrasts explicitly with some prior state
of affairs (which is thereby viewed as complete). Often, it entails a telic sense that an
anticipated point of state-onset or event-termination has been reached. Typical English
translations for the sense of -kú ‘CMPL’ in different contexts include ‘yet’ (in the negative,as in not yet arrived), ‘now’, ‘have become’, ‘finally’, ‘after all’, ‘in the end’, ‘at last’,
‘anymore’ (in the negative) or ‘already’. Interestingly, -kú ‘CMPL’ also has a related sense‘back’ in the sense of ‘return to original position’, as when a predicate refers to a state of
affairs that is ordinarily true of the subject referent, but from which it had departed for
some duration; examples of this sense would include ‘went (back) home’ or ‘opened his
eyes (which were temporarily closed)’. Again, this usage refers to the completion of an
episode, in this case one entailing an excursion from normality.
         The following examples illustrate various uses of Completive -kú. In (642), which

is repeated from (636) above, Completive -kú marks a new state as contrasting with a

previous state, to which it is also thematically related. Failure to mark the Imperfective
predicate in -kú would give the clause the feel of happenstance, as though the speakerwere simply making a general observation which had no explicit relevance to the
preceding context.

In (643), -kú co-occurs with Change-of-state suffix -dàk ‘COS’. The senses of
  370H
Completive -kú and Change-of-state -dàk are closely aligned, and is it very common forthem to co-occur. The overall sense of changed state is basically accomplished in (643)    371H
by -dàk, additional marking in -kú entails a sense that a final state has been reached, and

  372H
final state of darkness having been reached; failure to mark in -kú in this example wouldleave open the possibility that it could at any moment become light again.

         Unlike most other types of predicate inflection, Completive -kú has the ability toco-occur with Modality suffixes, as in an Imperative clause. The explanation here seems
straightforward; since Imperative suffixes derive historically from primary predicate
inflections, and since Completive -kú co-occurs with primary predicate inflections(whereas most primary predicate inflections do not co-occur with one another), the
historically prior patterning is retained by the later forms (645).

In the preceding examples (642)-(645), -kú has been shown following primary aspectual
                            374H   375H
suffixes and their derivatives. As is also discussed and exemplified in §12.1, -kú also

precedes certain predicate inflections, including Negator -máa ‘NEG’ and Experientialperfect -bée ‘EPF’. This leads to the establishment of two predicate suffixal positions for       Completive -kú, with different semantic scope effects as exemplified in §12.1 ex. (612)-
                                                                                       37H   378H
(613), repeated below for convenience as (646)-(647). Note that -kú may not freely occur

in either position; the early position in (646) is licensed by the presence of Negator -máa;
                                                         3782H
if -máa were not present, the resulting predicate *càa-kú-rə́ ‘ascend-CMPL-IRR’ isungrammatical. The same applies in (647); in absence of the Irrealis suffix, we cannot
                                                  378H
       have *càa-máa-kú ‘ascend-NEG-CMPL’. However, when both positions are licensed, it is infact possible to find two iterations of the Completive suffix on the same predicate word;
       in (648), note that the first -kú iteration is licensed by the Negator -máa, while the second
         3784H

                                          3785H
the phonological value -kú, with two different semantic values – perhaps (a) contrast with

an earlier event/state and (b) completion of an event/state. However, this would not
ultimately seem to be a tenable analysis. As was noted above, the position of -kú – andthe attendant differences in scope effects (which may be responsible for the notionally
“different” semantic values (a) and (b)) – are determined structurally, in terms of co-
occurrence with particular predicate inflections. When only one position is licensed, only
one iteration of -kú is licensed – however, according to the context of utterance, either ofthe semantic values (a) and (b) may be brought out (649).  3786H

            Finally, as is also discussed in §13.2.2.1, -kú is homophonous with, and is clearly
                                              378H
semantically relatable to, a particle kú which occurs as a noun phrase or copula enclitic;in (650), note that phonological dependence of kú on noun phrase-final article go ‘IND’ –
  378H
which cannot be analysed as its grammatical head – shows that kú is not a structuralsuffix in this usage.

            Given these facts, together with the seeming ubiquity of -kú cognates throughoutTani languages, it seems very likely that (-)kú will reconstruct – probably with the samephonological value – as a highly versatile, free syntactic particle at the Proto-Tani stage.

predicate phrase syntax seemingly coalesced into a single grammatical word with suffixal
dependents while the noun phrase retained syntactic compositionality (cf. §2.1) – the

   By “desubordination”, I mean to indicate a process through which main clause predicate-ellipsis
(presumably, following principles of economy) leads to reanalysis of subordinated clause predicates as
main clause predicate heads, together with functional transference of the erstwhile matrix predicate

16.2.   Appositive coordination
        Appositive clause-coordination is based on a structural apposition between two
finite, potentially independent clauses (Figure 16.2).

        Figure 16.2 – Appositive coordination
16.2.1. Parallel structures
        The most basic type of appositive clause-coordination is based on structural
parallelism among two apposed final clauses. Minimally, this consists of shared final
predicate marking (including TAM specification), and often also includes shared or
similar argument structures and/or adverbial modifications, as well as similar or
thematically relatable predicate semantics. In absence of any other marking and when
both clauses are matched in polarity, the function derived from parallel-structured
apposition is generally restatement, as when providing an alternative or supplementary
view on the same event. In (1051), a character in a folktale is describing the
                              4638H
disappearance of a chicken liver which had been entrusted to her care. The liver’s falling
and loss are thus two ways of viewing that same event, and are each expressed by way of
an individual clause. Note that both predicates are headed by intransitive verb roots, and
that they share the same subject, Completive aspectual marking and Direct (experienced)
perfective aspectual marking.

        Particular coordinative functions are also achieved in Galo through distinct types
of clause-level prosodic marking, whose markers are phonetically realized on the final
syllable nucleus of the last phonological word of a final clause. Such prosodic marking is
notable for overriding both the lexically-specified tone of a particular phonological word
and the “boundary” (lowering) tone which by default marks the termination of most Galo
final clauses (§4.2.2.3.2).

16.2.2.1. Non-final intonation type 1: “list” intonation
        “List” intonation consists of a marked rise (without fall) in pitch, symbolized _́́and glossed NFI1 (Non-Final Intonation type 1). The function of list intonation is to
indicate that the information contained in the marked clause is but one of several related
information units (for example, micro-activities within an overall macro-task, or
individual existential predications of entities which are construed to occur as a set); most
often, list environments also exploit parallel syntactic structures (§16.2.1) (1053).

13.3.3.2. Dubitative larèe       Dubitative larèe ‘DUB’ has the same distribution as Polar interrogative ree. Itindicates speaker surprise at seeing an indication that the marked information is or should
be the case, and forms an insistent polar question to verify whether it is or is not so (in
principle, probably expecting a negative answer) (791). In cases where the speaker and
                                                    4083H
addressee both know quite well that the marked information is not and can not be the case,
the sense is closer to a rhetorical question, possibly with disapproving and/or mirative
overtones; if (792) were marked in simple Polar interrogative particle ree ‘PQ’, it would
              408H
inappropriately suggest the speaker’s earnest ignorance as to whether or not his addressee
(in this case his son) was in fact insane.

Type B stems usually but not always do so. Table 10.3 summarizes these possibilities.

Table 10.3 – Stem types and inflection/derivation
        On the basis of the distribution outlined in Table 10.3, one might conclude that
                                                                        3125H
while prototypically verbal (A) and prototypically adjectival predicates (C) can be clearly
distinguished, derived predicate stems (B) can be more or less verb- or adjective-like in
their behaviour. It may ultimately be possible to further subdivide derived predicate stems
into “verbal” and “adjectival” subclasses, however that has not been accomplished as of
this writing. Some additional discussion on the verbal vs. adjectival nature of derived
predicate stemps may be found together with relevant in several of the sections referenced
above, as well as in §11.

10.4.   Predicate transitivity and argument structure        A predicate projects the argument structure of a predicative clause (§9.2). The     3127H
transitivity of a predicate is in turn a function of its internal constituents. A predicate of
simple stem Type C (adjectival) is generally intransitive (§5.2.3.1). A predicate of simple
                                                                                    3128H
stem Type A (verbal) derives its argument structure directly from the lexically-specified
transitivity of the head verb root (§5.2.4.1).
                                          3129H
        A predicate of complex stem Type B may have a wide variety of transitivity
specifications, which are a product of the interaction of the head root together with its one
or more derivations. Some predicate derivations function to reduce transitivity, often as
an outcome of adjectivalization. In (397)-(398), predicate derivation -kèn ‘GOOD/EASY’

10.5.   Multiword predicates        Up to now, we have only considered predicates which are composed of a single
grammatical word, with linearly-unfolding head-dependent constituency. In this section
we discuss Multiword predicates. Multiword predicates are morphologically complex;
they are also composed of more than one phonological word, and, in a special sense to be
outlined below, may also constitute a sequence of multiple grammatical words. However,
the “words” contained in a Multiword predicate are not syntactically independent, and
cannot occur outside of a Multiword predicate construction; hence, Multiword predicates
are not describable as “serial verb constructions” or “complex predicates” in the
traditional senses of these terms.","[446, 447, 448, 449]"
"§3.2.4). In short, phonological criteria suggest that this is not one but rather two words.
         Following the generally-accepted framework summarized in Dixon and
Aikhenvald (2002), as set forth in numerous previous works by them and other scholars,
this disconnect will be described here in terms of a difference between two types of unit:
“grammatical word” and “phonological word”. 71 The following subsections review
criteria by which these units may be identified. Some of these criteria involve
exceptionless (or rarely violable) rules, while others consist of more probabilistic
tendencies. In some cases, the convergence among or contrast between grammatical and
phonological words is robust, as in (17)-(18) above. In other cases, the analysis hinges on
thin and contextually variable criteria. The resulting picture is complex, perhaps in some
ways unsatisfyingly so. However, it must be recalled that Galo has heretofore been an
instrument for oral, face-to-face communication, and has not been significantly shaped by
conventionalization for writing purposes. Many of the difficulties found (by linguists and
native speakers alike) in consistently segmenting utterances into “words” for the purpose
of writing the language (as we are doing here) are, when speaking, simply a non-issue. 72
71
   This sense of “grammatical word” is not to be confused with another, unrelated sense in which
“grammatical word” denotes words which have as their value a grammatical function as opposed to a
lexical meaning, i.e. (in English) words like “the”, “to”, and “and” as opposed to “boat” and “tree”. To
avoid confusion, in the present work we use the term “grammatical word” in the Dixon-Aikhenvald sense of
opposition to “phonological word” and the term “function word” to refer to words with grammatical-
functional as opposed to lexical status.
72
   It is also instructive to consider that the word for ‘word’ in Galo agóm (< PTs *gom ‘speech; voice’) also
has the related senses ‘speech’, ‘language’, ‘utterance’, and ‘matter/point’. Thus, it might be more accurate
to gloss agóm as something like ‘communicum’ in the sense of ‘unit and/or medium of communication’,
without regard to segmentation or length. According to this definition (and according to Galo speakers’
usual judgments), both phonological and grammatical words may qualify as agóm (even when these do not
coincide), but neither roots nor affixes do. One might note here a potential similarity with Tibetan (among
other languages), in which multiword utterances, rather than words per se, are separated by spaces when
writing (Sprigg 1955). Importantly, such types contrast with the traditional Chinese concept of the basic
unit of language, the zǐ, which has a lower-level denotation including roots and morphemes, but no unit
                                                    153
4.1.1. Grammatical word
         As defined by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:§7), a grammatical word is
identifiable as a grammatical unit between morpheme and syntactic phrase, whose
constitutents are a head plus immediate (local) dependents, in a fixed, continuous order in
terms of a given semantic value. These identification criteria are probably universal, and
are expanded on only briefly here with reference to examples (17) and (18) above.
         a) indivisibility. Independent words cannot generally interrupt the strings of
morphemes expressed in (17) and (18). 73
         b) patterning as a unit. The strings in (17) and (18) can be moved and modified
within the syntax as wholes, but no subset can.
         c) fixed order. The orders of elements in (17) and (18) are fixed. While certain
sequences of grammatically bound forms (for example, predicate derivations (§11)) are to
an extent variably-ordered in Galo, variation always results in a different meaning; i.e., a
different grammatical word.
         d) status as a syntactic unit. The strings in (17) and (18), taken as wholes, each
realize a predicate (a unit referred to by various syntactic rules, which is a constituent of
various phrase types, etc). No subset of either string in (17) and (18) can qualify as such a
syntactic unit.
         e) grammatical part-whole composition. The functional and structural descriptions
of the parts in (17) and (18) refer to the whole, and the functional and structural
description of the whole makes reference to the parts. No elemental subset of (17) or (18)
relates to another constituent at the same or a higher level.
         f) native speaker awareness of meaning and independent status. Speaking very
generally, a speaker is more likely to feel comfortable uttering and assigning meaning to a
grammatical word in isolation than to one of its subparts. For example, most speakers
sense no difficulty in uttering and assigning meaning to zabdù in (17) out-of-context,although the same cannot be said of hidù in (18). There are difficulties in applying thiscriterion, since native speakers typically experience greater difficulties in assigning
meaning to function words than to lexemes (i.e., go in would go is more easily defined orlarger than a word (Chao 1968). Some modern, linguistically-inclined Galo have coined the term gomcɨ ̀r
(lit., ‘speech pellet’) to denote sub-lexical roots and morphemes; it remains to be seen whether this usage
will become widely-accepted or not.
73
   For an important partial exception to this generalization, see §13.5.

described as a “word” than is would). Nonetheless, native speaker awareness of meaning
and independence may be employed as a supporting criterion.
         Stated simply then, a grammatical word is identifiable in being treated as a unit
by the grammar at various levels. Characteristics of phonological words will be shortly
discussed; first, it will be useful to review some of the properties of affixes and clitics.","[153, 154, 155]"

12.4.2. Speech acts: imperatives, hortatives and suggestives
            This section discusses speech act markers, which function as primary predicate
inflections in Galo. There is in addition a set of hortative particles which frequently – but
not obligatorily – co-occur with several of the forms discussed below, but which are not
themselves predicate inflections; they are discussed in §13.3.1.        382H
237
      The sense of ‘supposed to’ derives from the verb ə́m- ‘say; tell’, which has a functional use here as a
purposive. For similar examples and discussion of this function of ə́m-, see §16.7.

12.4.2.1. General imperatives -tó and -là(a)         The most general Galo imperative is in -tó, a form which appears to derivehistorically from Perfective suffix -tó (§12.3.2.4). Most often, imperative predicates in -tó
                                               382H
are either subsequently marked by an appropriate hortative or tag particle (667), or else
                                                                              3824H
exhibit stem derivation in Tentative -káa (basically with the distancing sense ‘try to’; see§11.2.3.1) (666). Imperatives in -tó obligatorily have a second person subject (singular,
 3825H      3826H

         Imperative -tó only very rarely occurs alone, with speakers possibly preferringadditional hortative marking to avoid confusion with the homophonous Perfective suffix.
However, in high-context situations (as when giving an extended set of directions), such
uses are possible (668). It is also possible – like the Perfective suffix – to find an
                    3827H
imperative in -tó marked by Non-final suffix -là(a) ‘NF’, and forming an element of an(all-imperative) clause chain (669). Such uses appear to have given rise to a ‘light’
                                382H
imperative with the form of a non-final marked perfective predicate; an imperative

         An imperative in -tó is used in cases when the commanded activity does notdirectly affect or benefit the speaker; it is ‘other-directed’. When the speaker is construed
as directly benefiting from or as being otherwise affected by an activity commanded of a
second person subject, the predicate is marked in ‘self-directed’ imperative -là(a) –possibly a derivative of the Non-final suffix -là(a) ‘NF’ (§16.4.2). The difference is most

             Imperatives in -tó may be formed upon any verb stem, but may not be formed onadjectival stems. Imperatives in -là(a) may only be formed on transitive and extendedintransitive/transitive stems. In a transitive imperative in -là(a), the O argument referentmust be speaker-coreferential (673). In an extended intransitive/transitive imperative, the

             ‘Please hit me!’ (KTR, 16:16)             Inclusive hortatives (let’s/shall we/why don’t we) are also formed in ‘self-directed’
imperative -là(a). In this case, marking in the Inclusive hortative particle zù is obligatory(see also §13.3.1.2), and the subject is obligatorily first person non-singular (dual or

                                        Summary
       This work is the first comprehensive descriptive grammar of the Lare dialect of
Galo, a Tibeto-Burman language of the Tani branch spoken in central Arunachal Pradesh
State, in the North-East Indian Himalaya. It is based on primary data obtained from
original fieldwork conducted by the author in Galo towns and villages in Arunachal
Pradesh. In addition to description of the synchronic phonology and grammar of Lare
Galo, it contains a historical overview and preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Galo
segmental phonology, in addition to a glossary of approximately 1,300 lexical roots with
4,000 lexical exemplars and three fully analyzed texts.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

13.7.6. Hesitation words
                A handful of Galo ‘Hesitation words’ are available to assist a speaker in moving
his turn forward when uncertain of precisely what he wants to say, or when unable to
remember a particular word or phrase. In addition to relatively inconsequential stand-
261
      An expressive variant of adjective accòo ‘quiet; careful; casual’.
262
      Note that the root lák- cannot be used as a lexical noun in modern Galo, although it is reflected in the
predicate derivation -lák ‘MISS’. Either this represents a highly idiosyncratic nominal use of a predicate
derivation, or, and more likely, it represents a fixed expression from an earlier stage of the language in
which monosyllabic roots were more likely to stand as lexemes.
                                                                 678
alone uses similar to stammering sounds such as əə… ‘uh…’ and mm… ‘umm…’, as wellas loanwords such as mane ‘that means; that’s to say’ (<Asm) (§13.4), true Hesitation
                                                                  4180H
words may act as “pro-lexemes”. Able to stand as a meaningless pro-head of any lexical
category, the function of a true Hesitation word is to preserve all of the grammar of the
speaker’s target construction, without requiring him to commit himself to a particular
lexeme to stand as its head; examples are məráa=go ‘HEST=IND’ ‘a whatever’ and məráa-tó ‘HEST-PFV’ ‘whatevered’. In (844), note that the speaker does not bother to repair his
                                 418H
use of the hesitation word məráa; he simply assumes the intended sense to be clear fromcontext, and proceeds with his narrative. For similar “pro-lexemic” use of həkə̀, see (818)
                                                                                      4182H

        (IR, FA 027)       Uses of hesitation words in nominal/noun phrase functions are often accompanied
by Topic marker əə or Locative postposition lo. Sometimes, these represent the truegrammatical constituents of a phrase in which a Hesitation word is standing as pro-
lexemic head; other times, they seem to represent more or less fused elements of an
embedded Hesitation phrase. In (845), note that only Genitive gə may be analysed as a

                                                                           4185H

          Hesitation words can be an excellent test for constituent boundaries – from a
linguist’s point of view – however I have found it very difficult to apply the test in
elicitation, as my consultants usually frown on overuse of hesitation words, insist they
would never use them themselves, and in short, cannot see the value of any sort of
scientific enquiry which would include them! It is possible that this barrier will eventually
be overcome, but for the moment, I have relied only on naturally-attested Hesitation word
utterances. The set of hesitation words attested in my corpus is listed in Table 13.19.

14. Grammatical, semantic and pragmatic noun phrase functions and their marking        This chapter discusses the grammatical, semantic and pragmatic functions played
by noun phrases in a Galo clause, as well as the operators which mark them. It is divided
into three main sections: an overview section in §14.1, followed by a detailed description
                                                    418H
of the basic functions and functional extensions of pragmatic marking in §14.2 and of
                                                                             4189H
grammatical and semantic noun phrase relational markers in §14.3.4190H
14.1.   Grammatical functions and grammatical relations
        “Grammatical functions” may be understood quite generally to indicate the
grammatical role played by a particular noun phrase with respect to the argument
structure of the clause in which it occurs: namely, whether the noun phrase stands as a
core argument of that clause, or not, and if so, as what sort, etc. By contrast, the term
“grammatical relations” has come to be understood as referring to the grammaticalization
of particular “macro-alignments” of grammatical functions, as they are reflected in and/or
made use of in various and potentially quite diverse areas of the grammar (Andrews
1985). While there is nothing approaching widespread agreement concerning the
applicability of both concepts (in the same way or at all) to all languages, it seems to me
that their application in this way leads to a reasonable description of the grammar of Galo.
The following three subsections will present an overview.","[675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682]"
"Concepts denoting negative value are generally not lexicalized; the normal way of saying
‘bad’ is alə́-máa ‘good-NEG’. Distasteful items or those which cause a disagreeableexperience (but which are neutral in terms of inherent value) are described using the
adjectivalizing Manner predicate derivation -nèk ‘BAD’ (§11.2.1).    2194H
5.2.3.6. Colour
                                                244
         Most COLOUR terms employ the prefix ja- ‘FDIM’ (§5.3.1.1.3). They structurally
                                                                      2195H
resemble nouns, and may also be used as nouns. The only real motivation for viewing
COLOUR terms as basic adjectives is that while use as an adjective denotes the colourconcept itself, a nominal use usually denotes an entity of that type, as jakàa-dùu ‘black-IPFV’ ‘(it’s) black’ but jakàa=go ‘black=IND’ ‘(a) black one’; to denote the abstractconcept for nominal use, a COLOUR term must be nominalized, as jakàa-nam ‘black-NZR:RLS’ ‘blackness; being black; (the concept of) black’.","[244, 245]"
"                                               355
         Finally, in case the relative location of the referent-to-be-marked is unknown to
the speaker, or is presumed by the speaker to be unknown to the addressee (for example,
if the referent is or is located in a place or country whose name is known, but whose
location relative to the deictic centre is unknown), same level demonstratives are used as a
sort of “default”. For example, the following sentence is almost always uttered when I am
introduced to a Galo for the first time (225). 2689H
(225) bɨ ̂ɨ ostelia akkə̀.
         bɨ ̀ɨ ostelia  akə̀=əə
         3.SG Australia ABL.SLEV=COP.IPFV
         ‘He’s from Australia.’ (Passim)Although a speaker of (225) may know very well him- or herself that Australia is
                               2690H
basically to the south of the Galo area, the riding assumption is that this fact is not
generally within the collective knowledge of Galo people; the implication is thus not that
Australia is “on the same level” as the place of speaking, but rather that Australia’s
precise location is either unknowable or is, for most purposes, a matter of little
importance.
         Table 7.12 summarizes the selection procedure.
         2691H
Step 1) Is referent location knowable?     Yes               → Go to Step 2
                                           No                → Use Same-Level set
Step 2) Is referent potentially visible?   Yes               → Construe in terms of elevation

                All Proximate and Distal simplex demonstratives appear to be etymologically
non-compositional. Hyperdistal and Megadistal forms may be described as prosodic
variants of the simplex Distal forms, and are also probably etymologically
noncompositional. All simplex demonstratives take pronominal (suffixal) case-marking
(§6.1.3).
        2695H
7.4.2.2. Basic functions
                The principle function of a simplex demonstrative is to mark a referential non-
oblique noun phrase for spatial-deictic and discourse-pragmatic values, as discussed in
§7.4.1. In (226), simplex distal demonstrative (upward) tə̀ marks the CS argument of a
 269H              2697H
copula clause as spatially upward of the deictic centre. In (227), simplex speaker-
                                                                        2698H
proximate demonstrative hì marks the O argument of a final clause as a Proximal topic. 160                  159F

160
    At the time of speaking, the rice beer in question was in fact spatially downward of both the speaker and
her interlocutor, suggesting that use of the speaker-proximate demonstrative was discourse-importance-
oriented rather than spatially-oriented. It must of course be admitted, however, that in many cases these uses
overlap (for example, a referent which is near to the speaker may also be important, and vice versa), and it
is not always possible to differentiate in a particular use between these ostensibly different types of function.

7.4.2.3. Extended functions
       Capitalizing on its discourse-pragmatic value as a marker of Proximal topics
(which, that is, may also be construed as spatially proximate, or else are unspecified for
spatial deixis (§7.4.1.2, ex. (218); cf. also (227))), Speaker-proximate simplex

demonstrative hì has also developed the extended functionality of marking a spatiallynon-proximal referent as a Proximal topic.
       In the sequence in (228)-(229), which represents a continuous stretch of text from
                                   270H          2703H
the same speaker, note in (228) that the noun phrase referent “our place” – marked by the

Individuative speaker-proximate demonstrative hɨgɨ ̀ – may be simultaneously understoodas spatially speaker-proximate and topically prominent. In (229) however, a new,

spatially non-speaker-proximal discourse topic is established. A salient contrast in spatial
location motivates the speaker to shift to a distal demonstrative, which, unlike proximate
demonstratives, has no capacity to mark a proximal topic. Therefore, the noun phrase is
simultaneously marked in hì – which is now no longer interpretable as a spatial-deicticdemonstrative.

       Although dedicated use of this “Proximal topic-marking” function of hì on non-spatially-speaker-proximal noun phrases is very rare by comparison with use of the                                                                 358
general Topic-marker əə, it would seem that they have basically the same purelydiscourse-oriented functionality and overall categorical status within the noun phrase (i.e.,

“demonstrative” use of hì as in (227), hì in (229) cannot be “bracketed” around the noun

Table 7.14 – Semblative/genitive demonstratives
        The structure and distribution of Semblative/Genitive demonstratives suggest a
diachronic origin in Simplex distal demonstrative suffixation by Genitive pronominal
suffix -kə̀, as tə̀-kə̀ ‘DST.UP-GEN’. Like Genitive-marked pronouns but unlike most otherdemonstratives, Semblative demonstratives take phrasal enclitics, but do not take (further)
pronominal case suffixes when occurring as the sole constituent of an argument noun
phrase; this would seemingly suggest an origin as a headless noun phrase as təkə̀=go‘DST.SEMB.UP=IND’, possibly reflecting tə̀-kə̀ Ø go ‘DST.UP-GEN (NOM) IND’. Descriptionof Semblative/Genitive demonstratives as an independent paradigm basically hinges on
the seeming lexicalization of (unpredictable) progressive vowel harmony i → ə in the                                                            359

5.3.1.4. Two-term compounds
         Two-term compounds are usually quadrisyllabic constructions composed of two
disyllabic nouns or adjectives, with the overall prosodic status of a phonological phrase
(§4.1.4), and with the grammatical status of a single grammatical word (usually a noun).
  281H
Although many two-term compounds are not synchronically analyzable to speakers, the
patterns on which they are formed are in general productive in modern Galo.
         Two-term compounds may be symmetrical (§5.3.1.4.1) or asymmetrical
                                                           28H
(§5.3.1.4.2). Asymmetrical two-term compounds are further subdivided into common
  283H
(§5.3.1.4.2.1), root-pivotal (§5.3.1.4.2.2) and expressive (§5.3.1.4.2.3) subtypes.

5.3.1.4.1. Symmetrical two-term compounds          Symmetrical two-term compounds (a.k.a. “coordinative compounds”) are
composed of two structurally and semantically parallel terms (usually nouns and
deverbal nominalizations, but sometimes also adjectives). In a symmetrical two-term
compound, each term denotes a prototypical exemplar, or a particularly salient or
inalienable feature of a natural class or type denoted by the whole. For example, in
hodúm-horə́ ‘big game’, hodúm ‘barking deer’ and horə́ ‘boar’ are each among the mostcommonly hunted ‘big game’ animals, and donám ‘eating’ and tɨɨnám ‘imbibing’ are themost important aspects of a person’s donám-tɨɨnám ‘upkeep; sustenance’. Orderingappears largely conventional, as opposed to semantically hierarchical; for example,
although anə̀ ‘mother’ certainly precedes ɲamə́ə ‘daughter-in-law’ in Galo socialhierarchy, and likewise precedes it in the compound anə̀-ɲamə́ə ‘mature women’ – thereverse is the case for ací-abó ‘elder brother-father’ ‘mature men’ (Table 5.40).

7.4.3.2. Basic functions
       Genitive demonstratives stand as or mark a noun phrase-internal genitive phrase
for deixis, usually in possessive functions (231).

       ‘“O Elder Sister Mumsi, I have brought the meal packet from your parents up
       there.”‘ (lit., ‘your parents up there’s…’) (NyPB, LAT 297)       Semblative demonstratives stand as or mark a referring noun phrase as an
exemplar of a kind or sort, generally for use as a standard of comparison. Semblative
demonstratives thus, in a sense, are bi-referential, in that they simultaneously refer to one
entity (say, the “primary referent”) which is construed as the entity actually participating
in the event/state denoted by the clause predicate, as well as another entity (say, the
“secondary referent”) which is construed as the standard against which the primary
referent’s identity may be fixed. For example, in (232), the S argument noun phrase refers
                                                         2713H
to a chicken of a particular type which the predicate asserts to exist in a particular place.
The S argument reference is fixed, however, in terms of a different individual (exemplar
of the type) which is actually located spatially upwards of the deictic centre at the time of
speaking. Similarly, in (233), the speaker identifies a type of tree which he asserts to be
                           2714H
beautiful in terms of an actual exemplar of that type which was located upwards of him
and his interlocutor at the time of speaking,

7.4.3.3.1. “Hesitation” use of həkə̀
        Capitalizing on its potential for cataphoric discourse-functional use with the basic
sense ‘of the sort/type of this (following) thing’ (§7.4.1.2), həkə̀ has become one of the
                                                      270H
three most frequent native Galo hesitation particles or words, akin to English sorta. Like
the dedicated, semantically empty hesitation particle/word məráa ‘HEST’ (§13.7.6), həkə̀
                                                                                271H
in its hesitation use is able to stand as a pro-form for any type of lexical head. In (236),
                                                                                       27H
note the use of həkə̀ as a “pro-predicate-head” – an impossibility for any otherdemonstrative, Semblative or otherwise – as well as its alternation with məráa ‘HEST’ inthe same function. In (237), note that həkə̀ in hesitating use repeats the genitive phrase
                       273H
constituent in a hesitating function, and that the genitive reflex is phrasal enclitic gə; thiswould suggest that həkə̀ is here functioning as a syntactic common nominal rather thanpronoun.

7.4.3.3.2. “Plural indefinite” use of əkə̀
                                              362
            Despite its probably secondary origin, the most frequent function of Addressee-
proximate Semblative demonstrative əkə̀ is as a marker of plurality to indefinite or newly-established (animate or inanimate) referents in a discourse, akin to English some. It is
paradigmatically opposed in this function to Individuator go (see §14.2.1.2). əkə̀ in this
                                                                                    274H
function cannot occur pronominally, but instead must modify another noun phrase head.
In addition, it cannot precede the head; however, it can co-occur with another, different,
pre-head demonstrative. These facts together suggests that əkə̀ in “plural indefinite”function has or is developing the basic status of a plural indefinite article (§6.1.2.2.7).    275H

            Individuative demonstratives are found in speaker-proximate and addressee-
proximate forms hɨgɨ ̀ and əgə̀ only. Distal individuative demonstratives are not found inLare Galo. 161 Etymologically, Individuative demonstratives appear to derive from
                  160F
combinations of simplex proximate demonstratives with Individuator go, followed bylexicalization of Regressive vowel harmony (a very rare and irregular change in Galo
which has produced what may be the only extant short -ɨ rhyme in the language): *hi-go> *hi-gi > hɨ-gɨ ̀ and *ə-go > ə-gə̀.
            The form of the Speaker-proximate Individuative demonstrative is subject to some
variation among speakers, with the form higù ~ hɨgù occasionally attested among olderspeakers (cf. §7.3.3.2, ex. (194)). It is possible that this represents a more conservative

      Distal individuative demonstratives appear to exist in Pugo Galo, as in the attested Pugo sentence təgə̀
tə̂ə=na ‘DST.UP.IND DST.UP=DECL’ ‘it’s that one up there’; however, the distribution of such forms in Pugo
Galo has not been extensively researched as of this writing, and such expressions are not accepted by Lare
speakers. I can currently offer no hypothesis concerning the lack of such forms in Lare.

16.4.4.3. Additive concessive -gәrә́           Additive concessive suffix -gərə́ ‘ACNC’ appears to reflect a historical fusion ofIrrealis predicate inflection -rə́ ‘IRR’ (§12.4.1) with a predicate derivation of some kind,
                                                   478H
possibly Comitative applicative -gə́ ‘COMT’ (§11.2.5.4) (or a common historical precursor,
                                                            4789H
probably the verb root gә́- ‘carry/wear’); however, since there is very little evidence of aclause-continuity function of -gə́ ‘COMT’ used independently of -rә́ ‘IRR’, this cannot beasserted with any certainty. 309          308F
           In absence of any additional predicate marking, the core sense of -gərə́ ‘ACNC’ isone of Additive concession, as x and indeed, also y. In this capacity, -gərə́ ‘ACNC’ mayfunction as a predicate stem-coordinator. When coordinating two verbs or adjectives
denoting like properties, conditions or events, or those which can be construed as
naturally co-occurring, the sense of -gərə́ is basically additive, as ahòo-gərə́ adɨ ̀ɨ‘long/tall-ACNC strong’ ‘tall and (indeed) also strong’. When coordinating two verbs or
adjectives denoting dissimilar or unnaturally co-occurring properties, conditions or events,
the sense is contrastive; in (1111), coordination via -gərə́ implies an underlying belief that
                                  4790H
fat, egglike things are not generally also long or tall, but that in this case, the stone being
referred-to is just that.

           Albeit rarely, -gərə́ ‘ACNC’ may also occur as a clause coordinating suffix, againwith Additive concessive semantics. When clauses coordinated in -gərə́ are clearly309
      In Pugo Galo, the corresponding form is -gée, which would suggest pre-Pugo *-gə́-jé ‘COMT-IRR’ (< PG
*-gə́-rjé), following the regular Post-Proto-Galo Pugo processes of Circumsonorantal harmonization and
Intervocalic glide deletion (cf. also Conjectural particle bəree (Pugo bee) (§13.3.3.4), in which the same set
of changes are observed).

opposed in their information content (as when they are mismatched in polarity) the sense
is basically contrastive (1112). In the absence of such a mismatch, the sense is closer to a
                                 4791H
simple sequential function; in the initial clause of (1111) headed by mò- ‘make’, the sense
                                                              4792H

              The statistically most frequent use of Additive concessive -gərə́ by far is in aclause chain or accusative temporal subordination, again with the above-described set of
functions. In many such uses, it closely resembles Subsequential suffix -lèe ‘SSEQ’(§16.4.4.1), i.e. in giving a sense that ‘something follows’ from the marked clause
      4793H
(however, in a purely temporal/episodic rather than potentially causal sense). Also like
Subsequential -lèe ‘SSEQ’, Additive concessive -gərə́ ‘ACNC’ has the basic structural statusof a predicate inflection, thus licensing a temporal subordination in əəm(=əə)‘ACC.TSUB(=TOP)’ (1113).  479H

              An interesting emergent function of -gərə́ ‘ACNC’ seems to derive from omissionof contrastive (declarative) focal clauses such as the final clause of (1112). In this case,

which a coordinating function later evolved. This seems to me improbable, however, inasmuch as the likely

16.5.1. Overview
         There are three basic types of adverbial subordination:
         (A) adjectival subordination                  (§16.5.2)
                                                           479H
         (B) verbal subordination                      (§16.5.3)
                                                           480H
         (C) clausal subordination                     (§16.5.4)
                                                           4801H
         All of types (A)-(C) are marked by an enclitic bə́, which is homophonous with andalmost certainly relatable to the Dative enclitic bə́ (§14.3.3). 312 The ultimate historical
                                                                   4802H   31F
source of bə́ is uncertain; from the present standpoint, the most likely seeming ancestor isPTp nominal root *bə(ə) ‘way’ (cf. Lare Galo bədáa ‘road; way’, Pagro Mising lambə312
   Although I have distinguished adverbializing, clause-subordinating and dative noun phrase forming
functions in this grammar for ease of presentation (at least), it is important to note that the clause-level
syntactic statuses of adverbials and dative noun phrases are not all that different, and semantic similarities
are likewise clear. Ultimately, it may be preferable to assert the existence of a single “oblique phrase-
marking” enclitic, which might in principle be able to encompass all the identified functions of forms in bə́.

happi-ly, and/or I gave it his way → I gave it to him; of course, additional historical-
comparative work must be undertaken before this candidate etymology can be advanced
with any confidence.","[816, 817, 818, 819, 820]"

13. Particles               The present chapter discusses particles, defined as non-relational, non-inflectional
functional words which modify a major syntactic constituent (most often, an NP or a
Predicate/Clause). The first section §13.1 discusses the overall structural and functional
                                                3892H
properties of particles. The following sections §13.2 and §13.3 discuss particles which
                                                                         389H   3894H
bind to the noun phrase and predicate or clause, respectively. §13.4 supplements the    3895H
preceding two sections, discussing particles which appear to be recent loans from Indic
languages (and which are not used by all Galo speakers), and §13.5 discusses “versatile”        3896H
particles, which bind to any major constituent. The chapter is closed by sections §13.6                 3897H
and §13.7, which discuss interjective particles and interjections respectively.
        389H
13.1.          Overview
13.1.1. Synchronic perspective
               Particle is not a well-defined term either in principle or, usually, in practice. 240            239F
The most restrictive definition and consistent application of which I am aware is that of
Matisoff (1973: 154), who defines “particle” with respect to Lahu as a category
containing all and only bound syntactic words (i.e., words which cannot head a phrase,
which cannot stand as a headless phrase, and/or which cannot in any other way occur as
an independent syntactic constituent).
               While potentially satisfying on a purely structural basis, if there is a difficulty with
this definition, it may be the amount of functional diversity it admits. In addition to some
of the highly pragmatically-oriented, often clause-final functional words commonly found
in South East Asian languages – which are traditionally described as “particles” due to
their relatively small size and seemingly obscure word-class status – Matisoff’s definition
commits the analyst to including most types of adposition, case enclitic, and article, as
well as some forms probably traditionally described as “adverbs”, in a class whose
functional range then would extend from syntactic role marking to referential status
marking all the way to speaker attitude/stance marking.
               In the present work, markers of grammatical and/or referential status are treated as
(internal) phrasal constituents (§6.1.2, §14.2-§14.3); “particle” then denotes a relatively
                                         389H           390H     3901H
240
  It may be no exaggeration to say that while “adverb” is often used to describe a relatively large word
whose categorical status cannot be otherwise determined, “particle” is often used to describe a relatively
small one.
                                                               612
more “optional”, usually post-phrasal form, which provides supplementary (non-basic,
non-obligatory, and/or non-inflectional) pragmatic or epistemic information, and which
can often mark multiple constituent types and/or occur in more than one syntactic position
with the same basic function. This definition is almost certainly not watertight, neither in
the sense of clearly distinguishing particles from phrasal operators, nor in the sense of
enabling clearcut recognition of all and only the members of a well-motivated natural
class. Unfortunately, as with the “adverbs” and “prepositions” of English, the syntactic
and functional diversity of the Galo particle class is such that a well-motivated
subclassification would have to take an enormous range of synchronic and diachronic
facts into account – a project which both demands a much larger speech corpus than that
currently available and a work of more specialized approach. Thus, although an effort has
been made here to group and subclassify particles on well-motivated distributional and
functional grounds, both the category as a whole and its subclassification should be
viewed as highly provisional and subject to revision as more data become available.","[611, 612, 613]"

   The imagined contexts within which I elicited such formations on various occasions were one in which a
film clip was imagined in which a man entered a roomful of animals, bit a dog, and left, and another in
which a legendary historical figure, whose precise identity was unknown, was known to have bit a dog
(with supernatural consequences).
                                                  691
14.1.3.7. Non-occurrence of passive
         By “passive”, I understand a marked morphosyntactic operation of
detransitivization, in which the object is “raised” to subject position, and in which the
notional subject (underlying A) is expressed, or is expressible, as an oblique (Dixon 1994:
146). The presence of a passive construction in a language is often taken as strong
evidence for grammaticalization of and/or functional use of the grammatical relations of
“subject” and “object”. In Galo, however, despite relatively robust evidence for subject as
outlined in above sections, there is no marked syntactic construction in which a notional
subject is expressed or expressible as a main-clause-level oblique noun phrase, hence no
morphosyntactic “passive” as such. There are derivational operations which appear to
operate at the word level on the argument structure of predicates and the semantic roles
which are assigned to them, enabling semantic interpretations which render them
functionally similar to passives, 267 but none with the precise syntactic consequences
                                       26F
outlined above. 268
                  267F
14.1.3.8. O and E arguments and the grammatical relation(s) of “object”
         Above subsections reviewed evidence for the grammatical relation “subject” in
terms of intransitive and transitive clause types, using “object” as an informal label for the
syntactic realization of O. Turning to clause types with extended core argument structures,
however, the evidence for “object” becomes somewhat less categorical.
         In an extended transitive clause headed by a predicate in zí- ‘give’ – or elsederived by the related Benefactive applicative -zí – both O and E arguments are typicallymarked in the accusative (865).4235H
267
    Cf. especially the ‘Reversive’ suffix -kò (§11.2.5.8), which has the effect of causing the argument roles
of A and O to be reversed (schematically, I hit-ko him, in which ‘him’ is understood as Agent and ‘I’ as
Patient). However, predicate marking in -kò seems to have no syntactic consequences at all, hence is not a
“passivizing” morpheme.
268
    I do not take the absence of a passive in Galo to argue against the relevance of passive constructions to
the description of grammatical relations in general. Rather, I would say that simply having the grammatical
relation “subject” does not in itself predict the presence of a passive. Inasmuch as a language may have one
or more other means of expressing a transitive non-actor in subject position, as is the case in Galo, there
may simply be no functional pressure to grammaticalize a true passive construction.

269
    Some speakers claim that dative-marking of E is “more correct” than marking in the accusative, which
could represent a relatively recent innovation. That claim notwithstanding, accusative-marking of E
arguments in ‘give’ type clauses is overwhelmingly more frequent than dative-marking in my data, and
seems quite independent of speaker age or geographical background; of course, a larger and more diverse
corpus than is currently available to me could eventually reveal patterned differences in their distribution.
270
    Another way of interpreting these data would be to suggest that (868) is not an internally-headed
relativization at all, but rather represents a variety of incorporation of the O argument noun phrase into the
grammatical predicate. The fact remains that E does not appear to have access to this operation (cf.
§15.3.1.3.2).

        ‘The male slave I gave (to someone)’ but not *‘The male slave to whom I gave
        (something).’ (MN, B5:128)        Similar statements can be made with respect to other verb types which appear to
be underlyingly subcategorized for E arguments. For example, Goal arguments of motion
verbs and Theme arguments of throw verbs are both referenced by non-subject
nominalizer -nam – as ín-nam mookò ‘go-NZR:NSUB place’ ‘place which was gone to’ andnáa-nam ɨlɨ ̀ɨ ‘throw.at-NZR:NSUB stone’ ‘stone which was thrown at
(something/someone)’. However, their marking at the clause level is quite different; Goal
arguments of motion verbs are usually either unmarked for case, or are marked in the
locative (although accusative marking is possible in a limited, “experiential” sense; see
§14.3.2.3), while Theme arguments of transfer verbs are generally marked as topical
 420H
instruments (§14.2.2.1.2.1).
                 421H
        In sum, E arguments align with O arguments in some respects (accessibility to
Accusative case-marking and Non-subject nominalization) but not in others (consistent
Accusative case-marking and accessibility to internally-headed relativization).
        At the same time, E arguments are distinct from obliques, despite that their
syntactic marking may sometimes overlap. Consider the oblique temporal and mediative
noun phrases, which initiate and terminate the sentence in (869).

extent of the marked referent may participate in the predicated event/state, despite that it                                                      622

13.2.2.9. Suppositional báa         The status of Suppositional báa is somewhat uncertain; at least some of myconsultants have claimed it to be a direct importation from plains languages which has
entered Galo as spoken in foothill areas only very recently (possibly, within the last few
years). I have not been able to investigate the matter fully (and could not say which
language is the supposed donor); however, báa is well-attested in my data in threeprimary functions:
         The first and probably “basic” function is marking an argument noun phrase
which is being placed under consideration as an example, much as in English suppose we
go home now (725).

        The particles described in this section primarily occur clause-finally. According to

It is sometimes difficult to determine whether the grammatical scope of a clause-final
particle is in fact over the entire clause or only the clausal focus (generally, predicate,
copula or verbless clause complement). Whatever the case, it is clear that inasmuch as no
clause-final particles are ever permitted to occur within a nominalized, subordinated or
non-final-marked predicate stem (unlike aspectual inflections; see §15.3.2), clause-final

       hiding under the stone are frightened into the basket, which is then raised and drained.
       Only shellfish are caught using this method. In this sense, we can say that tahúm‘shellfish’ denotes a type of entity prototypically associated with the event or state
denoted by the predicate.

argument and compound-element-like or incorporated status (Mithun 1984). For example,
predicates in kú- almost always occur with an adjacent, bare noun tahúm ‘shellfish’ as in(914); although I have found it possible in elicitation to mark the noun tahúm in the
431H
accusative in sentences like (914), thus establishing kú- as – potentially, at least – a
                                    432H
       transitive verb root capable of taking tahúm as its O argument head, my consultantsassured me they would never actually speak this way. In natural speech, kú- would almostnever be uttered in absence of collocated tahúm, and tahúm would almost never be case       marked.
              In other cases, we find prototypically predicate-collocated nominals occurring
       with predicate types which are very clear in being able to take a wide variety of S/A or O
       arguments; in this case, however, collocated arguments may occur as a means of limiting

         The occurrence of non-case-marked acín ‘cooked rice’ in (915) limits the
                                                                    43H
denotational range of dó- ‘eat’ to one of its potential senses ‘having a meal’, inasmuch as‘cooked rice’ is the prototypical entity associated with the event type ‘eat a meal’ in Galo
culture. As such, it is possible to correctly answer әәm, dó-bée ‘yes eat-EPF’ ‘yes, I have’to (915) even if one has on some rare occasion in fact eaten roti bread rather than rice – if
  435H
the roti constituted one’s meal rather than a snack – and one might just as easily ask the
question in (915) as a means of making polite conversation even if one were perfectly
             436H
aware that one’s addressee did not eat rice for his meal, etc.
         Thus, one might suppose that acín-donám ‘cooked.rice-eat.NZR:RLS’ represents alexicalized, compound-like association between noun and verb, rather than a clause-level
argument-predicate relation per se, and this is certainly true to an extent. But it is always
possible to case-mark a prototypically-associated nominal if the sense intended is
somehow contrastive. So, for example nó acín=əəm dó-bée? ‘2.SG cooked.rice=ACC eat-EPF’ ‘have you eaten the rice ~ have you ever eaten rice’ might be asked if a speaker wasgenuinely wondering if his addressee (presumably a non-Galo) had ever eaten rice before
in his life (assuming there to be any number of other unspecified things which he has
eaten), and/or was aware that the addressee had been served a variety of foodstuffs (as at
a banquet) and was wondering if he had eaten the rice yet (as distinct from whatever else
was known to be available).
         Uses of prototypically predicate-collocated nominals abound in Galo discourse.
Although they most commonly reflect an underlying O argument of the predicate, many
other types of relation are also attested. For example, in isì-hú-nam ‘water-wash.body-NZR:RLS’ ‘to bathe’, isì ‘water’ is an underlying instrument of the verb, as shown in ŋóisì=әə alə̀=əəm hú-rә́ ‘1.SG water=TOP foot/leg=ACC wash.body-IRR’ ‘I’m going to
wash my feet with water (as opposed to a chemical solution, etc.)’. In (916) below, the

sense of láa- ‘take’ is ‘marry’, a transitive sense in which A is ‘(male) marrier’ and O is‘(female) married (in the sense of having been taken into the family)’. Nominals
prototypically-associated with the ‘marry’ sense of ‘take’ such as ɲimә́ ‘wife’ can bemarked in the accusative if, for example, contrastive with ɲamә́ә ‘daughter-in-law’ (aswhen clarifying that one is speaking from the groom’s perspective rather than from the
perspective of an elder male of the groom’s family). In (916), however, note that the O
                                                                           438H
argument is realized in the syntax as kohùk=əəm ‘dried.oko.leaf=ACC’; and yet, theprototypical object ɲimә́ ‘wife’ is retained as an un-case-marked, prototypically-associated nominal. If ɲimә́ ‘wife’ were case-marked under these conditions, it wouldhave to be marked in the dative. However, rather than considering ɲimә́ in (916) to occur  439H
as a (zero-marked) E or oblique noun phrase, it may be preferable to consider it as weakly
incorporated into and/or compounded to the predicate, in the sense of functioning simply
to restrict or disambiguate the sense of ‘take’ intended (without which, it would be
understood that the A argument referent ‘took’, i.e. picked up, a dried-up oko leaf). The
concept of weak “incorporation” is also discussed in §5.3.2.1.     4350H

non-case-marked, predicate-adjacent nominals are understood as generic, non-referential
syntactic arguments or as elements of a lexicalized collocation with a particular predicate
type. In fact, the latter category is probably productively fed by the former, and would
presumably directly relate to the existence of culturally prominent, hence frequently-

fertile ground for further anthropological-linguistic research.","[714, 715, 716, 717, 718]"

  The term “tribal” is (in my experience) used without hesitation and without so much as awareness of any
possible negative connotations, in both official and unofficial discourse, by both “tribals” and “non-tribals”
throughout India; if anything, in North-East India, “tribal” has a positive connotation, at least when used by
tribal people themselves. I follow this tradition in my use of the term “tribal”.

         The cultural-linguistic history of North-East India is a fascinating but seriously
understudied field. Some contemporary scholars have attempted to describe the historical
geography and populations of North-East India in terms of Indic – usually, Hindu –
historical myths and traditional beliefs, some of which are even taught as fact in the
modern public and private school systems. However, evidence from toponyms (chiefly,
river names) suggest that the plains areas, as well as at least some hill areas, were
probably inhabited by Bodo-Kachari tribespeople at the earliest potentially reconstructible
time period, whenever that may have been (Gait 1997 [1926]). 3 The cultural and
linguistic descendants of these early Bodo-Kachari groups remain among the most
widespread of the North-East Indian plains peoples. 4 At subsequent but uncertain
historical points, it appears that Indo-Aryan speaking populations migrated northward and
eastward from the Bengali area (modern West Bengal state of India and the nation of
Bangladesh). Mixture with local tribal populations in turn gave rise to the eventual
coalescence of the Assamese people who currently dominate most parts of the
Brahmaputra plain. The plains were later ruled by the Tai Ahom, who invaded circa 1228
AD with considerable success from their traditional base in the Shan states of Northern
Burma (Gohain 1999). However, the Tai Ahom were inevitably overwhelmed by the far
larger Indo-Aryan population; although numerous modern-day Assamese trace their
ancestry to the Tai Ahom, there now exist – comparatively speaking, of course – only
remnants of the earlier Tai culture. Although there are now numerous and admirable
efforts toward revival in some form or another, as a first-language medium of
communication at least, the Ahom language is and has long been extinct (Morey 2005:17).
           The history and migration patterns of the hill cultures remain largely obscure.
Although there is a widespread assumption among most scholars that these mostly
Tibeto-Burman cultures must have originated from outside the North-East – an
assumption which is, incidentally, shared by the majority of the peoples themselves –3
    A glance at any detailed map of Assam will reveal numerous river names with initial di- or, less often, ti-,
both of which cannot possibly reflect anything other than PTB *ti ‘water’ (Matisoff 2003:674). These
names in many cases persist even in areas which have long been settled by non-Tibeto-Burman peoples
(whether Indo-Aryan or Tai), although gradual shifts over time have of course occurred; the Brahmaputra
itself was known in at least some places as the ti-lao at the time of the Ahom invasion, as discussed by Gait
(1997 [1926]:6).
4
  Prior to the arrival of Bodo-Kachari populations, it is perhaps reasonable to suppose that much of the
North-East would have been inhabited by Austro-Asiatic-speaking populations, whose cultural-linguistic
descendants persist as the Khasi of Meghalaya, North-East India, as well as (perhaps more distantly) the
Munda to the west. However, I am not aware of any concrete support for such a theory beyond the current
distribution of these populations and the seeming unlikelihood that Austro-Asiatic speakers could have
penetrated so deeply into the Indian subcontinent from their presumed original home in mainland South
East Asia unless they controlled large contiguous areas, perhaps at various historical times, in between.

very little concrete evidence indeed has been brought to bear as of this writing (a few
details relating directly to the Tani languages and cultures are sketched in §1.2.2).
        Geographically, the plains of North-East India are dominated by the enormous
Brahmaputra River, which drains the hills and continues through Bangladesh, emptying
into the Bay of Bengal. The massive, yearly flooding of the Brahmaputra renders the
surrounding valley ideally suited for wet rice cultivation, which has traditionally been the
mainstay of the plains economy. By contrast, hill tribes populate the Himalayan foothills,
traditionally practicing shifting, jhum or ‘slash-and-burn’ cultivation on hillsides,
supplemented by hunting and gathering. In most areas, although crops and agricultural
techniques have been diversified somewhat, shifting cultivation is still practiced. Hills
and mountains are often very steep, and despite a period of intensive logging in the late
20th century (since largely curtailed) many jungles remain to this day all but impenetrable
(Figure 1.3).","[29, 30, 31, 32]"

   Note also that the system does not appear to provide for a question with a first person subject. This
seems not to be related to conjunct/disjunct patterning as such, but rather relates to difficulties associated
with asking a first person question in the ‘Direct’ perfective -bá(a), which indicates direct experience of an
event; if anyone had directly experienced the speaker’s eating, it would surely be the speaker rather than an
addressee.

       Disjunct imperfective -ée ‘IPFV.DISJ’ marks an event whose natural point oftermination has not yet been reached. It does not always contrast clearly with -gée‘PFV.DISJ’ in the ‘Direct’ perfective in -bá(a), inasmuch as the overall event is generallyviewed in this construction as over with or in past time, from the point of view of the
speaker’s personal experience. However, in the context of motion predicates, there is a
clear contrast: in the sentence in -ée ‘IPFV.DISJ’ in (696), note that the subject is construed
                                                     3879H

the subject is construed to have gone and returned. In both cases, the event is viewed as
having been witnessed or otherwise experienced by the speaker in the past.

main declarative clauses with second (700) and third person subjects only (701); first

       “disjunct” pattern, it is not obviously paradigmatic with the Experiential perfect -bée       ‘EPF’. For one thing, the Experiential perfect is attested with third person subjects in both
       statements and questions (cf. examples in §12.3.2.7). For another thing, the Experiential

perfect – like all perfect(ive) aspects – cannot occur in a clausal subordination, meaning
that it cannot occur as a “conjunct” cross-clause coreferentiality marker. Thus, although I
do not wish to discount my consultants’ intuitions regarding the relatedness of the Stative
imperfective and Experiential perfect in terms of subject person alternations in certain
functions, it is clear that it does not operate as a fully-fledged conjunct/disjunct pattern for
       all speakers.

12.5.3. Discussion
       By comparison with other Tibeto-Burman languages for which it has been
identified, conjunct/disjunct marking in Galo appears relatively impoverished. Not only
does it not occur in simple main clauses, it does not appear to have uniform properties in
those areas of the grammar in which it is found. Although more comparative work on
Tani languages should be undertaken prior to making any firm statements, it would seem
that, in Galo, we may be dealing with a decayed (and possibly still decaying) system
which, while once potentially robust, is now retained only in areas of the grammar in
which it seems likely to have had a relatively high functional value (such as in correlating
subject person with direct evidence of information).
       At the same time, there is evidence of a new conjunct/disjunct system arising in
the Intentional modality (§12.4.2.8, §16.6.2.2.1). Although restricted to a single modality,
                            3890H      3891H
the patterning is essentially that of a prototypical conjunct/disjunct system, and there is of
course a possibility (though nothing near a certainty) that it could eventually generalize.
       There is of course another possibility, however, and this is that conjunct/disjunct
systems arise (in some if not all languages) quite by accident. Developing in Galo (if not
in all languages which exhibit it) in at least one case from a fairly trivial process of de-
subordination through matrix predicate ellipsis, the grammaticalization of a
conjunct/disjunct system may not be motivated by any particular functional value
associated with the pattern itself – it may be simply a by-product of some functionally
quite unrelated process. Under the circumstances, it is possible that the emerging pattern
may be exploited for some functional potential which is as yet not well understood (but
which may well relate to evidentiality; see Sun (1993a) and Aikhenvald (2004:123-8)).
But it is also possible that the conjunct/disjunct pattern remains in a language as a pattern
simply because it is learned as a pattern; however, in terms of functional value, it may
have little if any at all. Such a system would be expected to decay over time, and that is
certainly what it looks like may have happened in Galo. Future research on related Tani
languages should enable us to determine whether Galo is anomalous in this respect, or not.","[607, 608, 609, 610, 611]"

1.2.10.1.4. Functional classes        Functional classes of the noun phrase include pronouns and demonstratives,
numerals, classifiers, relator nouns, qualifying nouns, articles and postpositions. Pronouns
and demonstratives are closely related but not identical in terms of functions and
distribution; all basic demonstratives may function pronominally, and many basic
pronouns also function as demonstratives; however, the differing internal structures of the20
  Zero-derivation also occurs, and can override these tendencies; however, it does not seem to be
generalizable as a uniform property of any particular lexical class or subclass.
                                                    54
two classes render them clearly distinct. Numerals, classifiers, relator nouns and
qualifying nouns all closely resemble lexical nouns in terms of structure and semantics,
and may be used as lexical NP-heads in certain conditions. However, all may also occur in
post-head modifying functions, which lexical nouns ordinarily cannot do; in terms of their
post-head modifying functions, they seem to constitute closed classes.
        Articles and postpositions are closely related and are in complementary
distribution in many functions. Both articles and postpositions also bear resemblances to
certain types of demonstrative, with which they are sometimes paradigmatically related.
For example, the set of “demonstrative postpositions” includes true demonstratives which,
however, also accomplish postpositional functions; for example, aló ‘Distal locative(same/unknown level)’. Despite these similarities, articles, demonstratives and
postpositions can all be clearly distinguished from one another in terms of their core
distributional properties.
        Functional classes of the predicate complex include predicate derivations and
predicate inflections. Predicate derivations constitute a very large class of bound,
predicate stem-expanding formatives which handle a wide array of modifying functions,
including manner, result, purpose, direction, modality, aspect/aktionsart, class change,
and valence rearrangement/change. Predicate inflections are suffixes marking polarity,
aspect, modality, and (to a very limited extent) evidentiality, as well as (again, to a limited
extent) “conjunct/disjunct” subject person-agreement.
        Functional classes of the clause include a wide array of particles, most of which
either occur clause-finally or noun-phrase-finally, but some of which may occur in a wide
range of syntactic positions, often with different scope effects. Noun-phrase-final
particles generally mark inter-clausal referential-continuity values, such as contrast, while
clause-final particles primarily mark epistemic status of propositions and illocutionary
force. Most types of particle have the ability to act as a “focus particle”, marking the focal
constituent of a cleft/focus construction. Additional functional classes at the clause level
include coordinating and hesitating particles – most of which derive from demonstratives
– as well as interjections.","[54, 55]"

11.2.5.2. Benefactive -zí ‘BEN’        -zí ‘BEN’ (< zí- ‘give’, PTs *bi) is described for convenience as a ‘Benefactive’applicative, although the argument it adds to a predicate caseframe is not always a
semantic beneficiary (it may be a maleficiary, or may be in some sense “neutral”).
Syntactically, it functions to add an E argument to a transitive or extended transitive
caseframe only; its use with intransitives is not attested in my corpus, and has not been
accepted by my consultants in elicitation. In (511), transitive verb of locution ɨ ́ɨ- ‘narrate’
