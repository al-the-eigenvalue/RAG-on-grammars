"The universal quantifier reading of Basque negative words does not arise
under licensers other than negation and second term of comparatives: their
distribution is thus much more restricted than that of negative polarity
items. Basque behaves in this regard as other languages which have two se-
ries of negative constituents (one universal, one existential) distinguished by
the mere presence of a focus feature (e.g. Greek, as shown by Giannakidou
1997). In Basque, both universal quantifiers and polarity items require the
overt presence of a negation particle.",[579]
"Without a clausemate negation, or some other licenser (see below), negative
words are not acceptable (again for most speakers). This also means that,
differently from other negative polarity items such as any- forms in English,
they don't have a 'free-choice' interpretation:(1151)    *Ezer           jango        nuke.
           anything       eat.FUT      AUX.POT
          Ί would eat anything (intended meaning).'",[571]
"
4.5.4. Negative constituents4.5.4.1. Negative polarity itemsNegative polarity items in Basque are built on words which are homony-
mous with the question words, by the addition of a prefix e- (>i- by dissimi-
lation) (Michelena 1985[1961]: 67, 304), probably related to negation ez
'in-, not, no' (3.1.6.1.4):(1149) a. i-nor           'anybody'
       b. i-noiz         'ever'
       c. i-non          'anywhere (location)'
       d. i-nora         'anywhere (direction)'
       e. e-zer          'anything'
       f. e-zein + Ν     'any n' (literary)Although these polarity items seem to incorporate morphologically a nega-
tive element, for most speakers, they don't have a negative value by them-
selves. They need the presence of an independent clausemate negation, as
shown by the contrast in (1150):
                                                                   Negation   541
(1150) Zer   ekarri duzu? Ezer                 *(ez).
       what bring AUX        anything           not
       'What did you bring? Nothing.'","[570, 571]"
"In the preceding examples, behin ere receives the interpretation 'not once',
rather than 'once not', and the polarity element inor is licensed in the inter-
pretation 'nobody'. Moreover, unlike with the regular focalized elements,
there is no presupposed proposition, negative or otherwise. The last exam-
ple shows that verbs may be focalized in negative sentences; the pre-
negation position is then occupied by the participle (usually reinforced with
ere 'also'), while the 'original' position the verb would occupy to the right
of negation is filled with the dummy verb egin. Sentence (1007) contains a
focalized verb where the 'original' position is occupied by a synthetic form
of the verb itself. This strategy emphasizes the event/state denoted by the
verb, as in verb-focalization with egin in positive clauses (see 4.4.3.2.1
above).
   If not focalized, pre-negative elements are interpreted as top-
ics/scrambled elements:
                                                                       Focalization 507

          harm    at.least      not     AUX    that.ERG     make.FUT
         'At least that will not do any harm.' [Itur. K.R.:63]Eastern dialects present another alternative for negative focalization, where
only the auxiliary is preposed. The negative particle is left behind along
with the participle:(1011)    JONEK      du       liburua    ez     irakurri.
          Jon.ERG AUX book             not read
         'It is Jon that has not read the book.'","[536, 537]"
"
4.5.4.2. The syntactic distribution of negative wordsBoth non-polar elements and negative polarity items can occur preceding
negation. Unlike non-polar elements such as subject noun phrases (1162b),
however, negative polarity items in pre-negative position must be adjacent
to the negative head (1162a) (Ortiz de Urbina 1989b):(1162) a.  *Inork           atzo/Mireni             ez zion erosi.
             anybody.ERG yesterday/Miren.DAT not AUX buy
           'Nobody bought it yesterday/for Miren.'
        b. Jonek      atzo/Mireni            ez zion erosi.
           Jon.ERG yesterday/Miren.DAT not AUX buy
           'Jon didn't buy it yesterday/for Miren.'",[574]
"This adjacency requirement between the negative head and the negative po-
larity item suggests a structural relation of agreement (Haegeman 1995),
whereas the free placement of the subject suggests its realization as a topic
(Ortiz de Urbina 1989b). It is obvious, however, that this agreement relation
does not strictly involve negative features: if it did, then we wouldn't expect
the post-negative position of negative polarity items, unless such an agree-
ment relation is optional. There is, on the other hand, a clear asymmetry be-
tween the prenegative and the postnegative domains regarding the licensing
of negative polarity items: whereas in the postverbal domain more than one
                                                                 Negation 545
negative polarity item can be licensed, the preverbal domain only provides
room for one:(1163) a. Inork         ez du       ezer           egin.
          anybody.ERG not AUX anything             do
          'Nobody did anything.'
       b. ΊΊInork       ezer       ez du           egin.
          anybody.ERG anything not AUX             do
          'Nobody did anything (intended).'
       c. Ez du      inork          ezer           egin.
          not AUX anybody.ERG anything             do
          'Nobody did anything.'","[574, 575]"
"Some negated main verbs such as uste 'think' also allow partitives inside
their complement clauses, as do inherently negative verbs like debekatu
'forbid', ukatu 'deny', etc. See 4.10.1.1.4 for complement clauses marked
partitive. 'Negation' must be understood here in a loose way, since formally
                                                            The noun phrase   125
positive sentences containing semantically negative adverbs such as nekez
'hardly', gutxitan 'seldom' may also license partitive phrases.(b) Complements of 'affective' predicates such as arraroa izan 'be strange,
    funny', harrigarria izan 'be surprising', harritu 'amaze', gaitza izan 'be
    hard', ebitatu 'avoid', sentitu 'be sorry' admit partitive phrases.(c) Interrogative clauses. Main and embedded yes-no questions are typical
    contexts where partitive expressions are found:(84) Behar dugu ogi-rik?
      need AUX bread.PRTT
      'Do we need any bread?'","[154, 155]"
"If negative universal quantifiers must be in an agreement relation with the
negative particle, as suggested above, orders such as (1178) can be due to a
further displacement to the left of the complex negation+auxiliary.
   The ambiguity presented in (1175) only arises when the two polarity ele-
ments are clausemate:(1179) Inork           ez du       uste [ezer       (ere)
        anybody.ERG not AUX think anything (at.all)
        gertatu denik].
        happen AUX.COMP.PRTT
       'Nobody thinks that anything happened.'
       (Can't mean) 'Nobody thinks that nothing happened.'",[579]
"4.4.7. Focalization and interrogation in negative clauses4.4.7.1. Negative questionsNegative wh-questions are formed in the same way as positive questions:
the wh-word will occur immediately to the left of the tensed verbal form.
However, when the latter is an auxiliary, it will appear displaced to the left
of the clause, away from the position to the right of the participle it occupies
in positive sentences (see 4.5). Indirect negative wh-questions are formed in
the same way, differing only in that their tensed verbal form is marked with
the complementizer -n:(992) Nork        ez du       ulertu       esan             dudana?
        who.ERG   not AUX understand say                   AUX.COMP.DET
       'Who did not understand what I said?'",[533]
"    The perception of main prominence is independent of the lexical or de-
rived nature of the accent on the word preceding the verb. That is, the same
perception of main prominence is obtained whether the word is lexically ac-
cented or unaccented. The phrase with main prominence constitutes an into-
national boundary from what follows, starting with the verb; this would be
the division between the two parts we mentioned above.
   The verb itself may be the most prominent element, if it is the focus of
the utterance. There are two different types of verb focalization: in the first
type, the emphasis may be placed on asserting the realization of the event
expressed by the verb. That is, the speaker stresses the fact that the event has
occurred, is occurring or will occur. In the second type, the speaker wishes
to emphasize the realization of the type of event expressed by the verb,
stressing that it is that type of event that has occurred, is occurring or will
occur, and not any other type of event. Thus, one of the contexts in which
this type of focalization may be used is in contexts in which the speaker
wishes to correct what another speaker stated (cf. section 4.4.3.2 for more
syntactic details on these two types of verb focalization).
   In the first type, in analytical forms the last syllable of the main verb re-
ceives a pitch accent (cf. [10a]). In synthetic forms, the prefix ba- is inserted
before the verb, and the pitch accent falls on the last syllable of the verb if it
is unaccented (cf. 10 b.); if the verb is accented, two pitch accents surface,
one on the prefix ba- and another on the penultimate syllable of the syn-
                                                                  Intonation    81
thetic verb (cf. [10c]). In the second type, besides the main verb receiving a
pitch accent on its final syllable, the dummy verb eiii 'do' is inserted be-
tween the main verb and the auxiliary, both in analytic and synthetic forms
(cf. [11]). The word receiving focal accent is written in boldface:(10) a. Mikelek      deitxu dotzo   Mireneri.
         Mikel.ERG call      AUX    Miren.DAT
         'Mikel has called Miren.'
         (asserting that the event of Mikel calling Miren has taken place)
      b. Badator gero aitxtixa.
         ba-come later grandpa
         'Grandpa is coming later.'
         (asserting that the event of grandpa coming will take place)
      c. Bädakärre dirua.
         ba-bring      money
         'They are bringing the money.'
         (asserting that the event of them bringing the money is taking
         place)(11) Mikelek      deitxü eiii ddotzo   Mireneri.
      Mikel.ERG call      do AUX       Miren.DAT
      'Mikel has called Mary.'
      (stressing the event of calling, as opposed to any other type of event)   In negative clauses, the negative particle and/or the auxiliary verb or syn-
thetic verb following it usually receive main prosodic prominence in the ut-
terance, although not in all circumstances (see [14] below). If the auxiliary
or synthetic verb following the negative element es 'no, not' (ez in Standard
Basque) is unaccented, the last syllable of the auxiliary or verb receives a
pitch accent and the negative particle is pronounced as part of the verb. If
the auxiliary or synthetic verb is accented, both the negative particle and the
penultimate syllable of the auxiliary or synthetic verb surface with a pitch
accent. Thus, compare (12a), where the negative particle is followed by the
unaccented auxiliary totzu (= dotzu., with devoicing of the initial consonant
after /s/) with (12b), where the negative particle is followed by the accented
auxiliary gait:nie:(12) a. Amak        es totzü esan ori etxeko.
        mother.ERG not AUX say that do.to
        'Mother has not told you to do that.'

         we.DAT not AUX       anything give
         'They haven't given us anything.'","[110, 111, 112]"
"But this is not always the case: when negative coordination is not clause-
mate with sentential negation, then a difference arises. Consider the follow-
ing examples:(1221) a.    Ez    dut    [[katurik ez              zakurrik]    ikusi
             not   AUX    cat.PRTT            not   dog.PRTT     see

            Ί don't think he has seen cats nor dogs.'
         b. Ez     dut    [[ez katurik              ez    zakurrik]       ikusi
             not   AUX    not     cat.PRTT not            dog.PRTT        see

            Ί don't think he didn't see neither cats nor dogs (that is, he either
            saw cats or he saw dogs).' Ί don't think he saw cats nor dogs.'
564 Syntax
With two overt negations, negative coordination behaves as a negative
quantifier (as English nothing), whereas with a single negation, it behaves
as a polarity item. The difference only surfaces 'long distance'.","[593, 594]"
"
Other means are only possible without any finite verb, for instance exclama-
tive clauses constructed by the addition of the affirmative morpheme bai
'yes':
(1247)    Bai          etxe          ederra!
          yes          house         nice.DET
          Ά really nice house/what a nice house!'",[601]
"The bound morpheme ba- expresses a contradicting affirmation, one that
negates a negative proposition or, alternatively, one that holds the positive
value of a proposition against a negative statement of that proposition.
Arejita provides the following minimal discourse:(1143) A: Ez dozu ikusi, bada.
          not AUX see           then
       B: Badot    ikusi.
          ba. AUX see
          'You didn't see it then. I DID see it.'",[568]
"Such construction is totally impossible in western dialects. It is not clear
whether this pattern represents a different strategy or whether it corresponds
to constituent negation. See Lafitte (1944) and Oyha^abal (1985).
   Negative yes/no questions are not marked in any special way other than
the presence of the negative particle ez. The yes/no interrogative particle al
and the northern yes/no complementizer -a may be found in these negative
questions:(996) Ez         al gara lagun           handiak?
         not     Q    are     friend   great.DET.PL
        'Aren't they great friends?' [Atx. Ob.: 143](997) Ez         al zaizu poeta        haundi     bat     iruditzen?

        'To do and undo everything, isn't that this world's law?' [Etch. Id.
        1:336]Indirect negative yes/no questions differ from direct ones in that auxiliary
preposing is not obligatory. This correlates with the tendency towards verb-
final orders in positive indirect yes/no questions:(999) a.        Galdetu dit       ea ez zaion             poeta haundi
                ask        AUX ea not AUX.COMP poet               great

4.4.7.2. Focalization in negative clausesJust like wh-words, foci may appear immediately to the left of the tensed
verbal form. The focalized constituent is pronounced with contrastive stress:(1000)    JONEK       ez   du        eskaera   sinatu.
          Jon.ERG not AUX petition             sign

          that.because not AUX friend.to reply          their
          proposamena   nire mesedetan     zetorrelako.
          proposal      my    favor.in    came.because
         'That is why I did not reply to my friends, because their proposal
         was beneficial to me.' [Atx. Ob.:77]This focus is interpreted outside of the scope of negation: in the first exam-
ple above, we identify Jon as the person about whom the presupposed nega-
tive statement not sign the petition is true. Similarly, in the following exam-
ple, a reason is identified that explains why the event answering my friends
did not take place. Thus, continuations like the following are unfelicitous:(1002)     #JONEK ez du eskaera sinatu, Peruk baizik.
         'JON did not sign the petition, but Peru.' (cf. [1025])(1003)    #HORREGATlK ez        nien     lagunei   arrapostu,   beste    arrazoi

          one.because but
         'That is why I did not reply to my friends, but because of another
         reason.'","[534, 535]"
"On the other hand, other elements dependent on negation for their interpre-
tation do fall under the scope of negation when focalized in this position.
This is illustrated below with the polarity item inor 'anyone' and with ere
'also', which, although not strictly speaking a polarity element, often takes
on the interpretation '(not) even' when in association with the negative ele-
ment (4.5.4.5.2). Just like with polarity elements, this interpretation may be
achieved in a position following the negative element but also in the imme-
diate pre-ez position if the element is focalized:

ing the licenser and the licensee. The most embedded clauses, the ones con-
taining the negative polarity item, do not necessarily take the partitive (al-
though they can). On the other hand, the presence of the partitive in the first
embedded clause is crucial:(1204) a.     *Ez    dut   uste    [[inor      etorriko   denik]

"Laka (1990) observes that narrow scope negation does not license negative
polarity items:(1206)    *Inork                 du        ez      aurdiki.

"And it is the target of head movement (section 4.5.2.1) and of syntactic
agreement (section 4.5.4.1). Typologically, Basque is a negative concord
language: it has been argued that negative concord is related to the presence
in a language of a negation head that can by itself negate a clause (see Row-

4.5. Negation
     R. Etxepare4.5.1. The category of negationMorphological and syntactic evidence support the idea that the negation
particle ez in Basque is an element of category X°, a head. The morphologi-
cal evidence is constituted by its word-internal presence in a handful of
adjectives and nouns with negative meaning:(1061) a. ezdeus ADJ 'insignificant' (<ez 'not' + deus 'anything')
       b. gauzaez ADJ 'incapable' (<gauza 'capable'+ ez)
       c. ezezagun ADJ 'unknown' (<ez+ezagun 'known')(1062) a. ezbehar Ν 'accident' (<ez+behar 'need')
       b. ezbide Ν 'absurdity' (<ez+bide 'way')
       c. ezaxola Ν 'carelessness' (<ez+axola 'care')
                                                                 Negation 517
Syntactically, the negative particle has a fixed position in the clause struc-
ture (see 4.5.2.1) and can never occur as an adverbial modifier in non-finite
or non-verbal contexts, as other negative particles of adverbial status can
(but see section 4.5.5, for exceptions in contrastive settings and a discus-
sion). Compare, in this regard, the following contrasts:(1063) a. He waited        [PP for       [not     too long]]
       b. II arrivera [PP dans           [pas     longtemps]]
          he arrive.will       in        not      too.long
          'He will arrive soon.' (from Muller, 1991)

          'He waited for not too long.'(1064a. He wore [NP not very expensive clothes]
     b. *[MP EZ oso jantzi        garestiak] zeramatzan
              not very clothes expensive woreEz can be used as a simple answer (as negation heads can generally -
Spanish,Italian-, but not negative adverbs -French, English):(1065) A: Etorri    al da?
           come      Q   AUX
           'Did he arrive?'
        B: Ez.","[546, 547]"
"    In elliptical negative sentences the use of ez 'no' after ere is obligatory:
Jon ez da herrira joango bihar eta ni ere ez 'Jon will not go to the village
and neither will I'; zuk ez dakizu eta nik ere ez 'you don't know it and nei-
ther do I'. Alternatively, the expression baita (affirmative, < bai eta) or ezta
(negative, < ez eta) precedes the modified element and ere follows it in el-
liptical sentences: baita ni ere Ί do too' (= ni ere bai)] ezta Jonek ere 'nei-
ther does Jon' (= Jonek ere ez)', baita guri ere 'also to us' (= guri ere bai).
Being a clitic, ere can not constitute an utterance by itself. On the other
hand, baita (ere) and ezta (ere) can be used as answers to questions: Jon
etorriko da, eta zu? — Baita (ere) 'Jon will come, and you? — I will too';
Jonek ez du egingo, eta zuk? - Ezta (ere) 'Jon will not do it, and you? — I
won't either'.
   There is a discontinuous expression ez ezik... ere 'not only...but also':
328   Morphology
(497) Barnean ezezik,      kanpoan ere bazegoen jende            asko.

      'Not only inside, but also outside there was a lot of people.'","[357, 358]"
"    Besides meaning 'also', ere also has the value of 'even' and is often used
in concessive subordinate clauses: pobrea bada ere 'even if s/he is poor',
konforme ez banago ere 'even if I don't agree', zure laguna banaiz ere
'even if I am your friend' (see section 4.10.2.1.4).
    Another use of ere is as an intensive element in a number of expression:
beti ere 'always, always', nolanahi ere 'in whichever way, in any case', izan
ere 'in fact'. This intensifying function is particularly prominent in negative
sentences: ezer ere (ez) 'nothing at all', inon ere (ez) 'nowhere at all', behin
ere (ez) '(not) even once', giving rise to negative polarity items like batere
'at all' (< bat 'one' + ere).",[358]
"Negative polarity items can only occur to the immediate left of negation,
and not as part of the right wide focus:(1124) a.   [Ezer      ez irakurtzeagatik]      suspenditu dugu.
            anything not read.NOM.because fail              AUX

      [Mitx. EIG VII:156]    Nothing else may intervene between the tensed verbal form and the par-
ticle, and any process affecting the former will also affect the latter. Thus,
displacement of the tensed form to the left in negative clauses (4.5.2) or in
marked focalization structures in eastern dialects (4.4.2) carries modal parti-
cles with it:
(458) Asmatu, ez omen zuen hiruzpalau                baizik egin.

      father.ERG     AUX throw
      'It was father who apparently threw it.' [Lafitte 1944, §117]    Modal particles are closely associated with inflection: they may not occur
in tenseless verbal forms, and pattern with inflection itself in that, unlike
other preverbal elements (such as negative ez or 'positive' ba) they do not
'count' as first elements shielding tensed forms from initial position (see
4.4.3). Contrast in this respect the following two examples:
(460) ez dator
      not comes
      's/he is not coming'(461) *omen dator
              comes
      's/he is apparently coming'   As usual, presence of the morpheme ba can salvage the latter case (ote
used to be exceptional in this respect, as indicated in the following section).
There is further syntactic evidence that particles 'count' as inflection: they
are the only elements which may stand between the participle and its auxil-
iary in positive analytic verbal forms, and they are also the only elements
that may 'intervene' between the focalized element and a synthetic verb.
Phonetically, they also form an accentual group with the tensed verb
(Hualde et al. 1994).","[346, 347]"
"   Also, in imperative forms in which the negative particle is followed by a
participial verb, the negative particle receives focal accent:(13) Es   etorri gure etxera!
     not come our house, to
     'Don't come to our house!'",[112]
"It is worth pointing out that aux-fronting in negative clauses is also far less
common in adjunct clauses, ranging from impossible in relatives to only op-
tional in many others (explicatives, conditionals, etc.); in fact the contexts
of lack of obligatoriness of aux-fronting in negatives coincide to a large ex-
tent with those in which egin and ba are less common. It is precisely in rela-
tives, which are obligatorily verb final, that these strategies are more
marked. If the latter, as suggested above, also involve fronting to the left of
the clause, the difficulty might be in verb fronting in those contexts in gen-
eral.
482 Syntax
4.4.5.1.2. Indirect questionsAll indirect questions may be marked by the coftiplementizer -n, attached to
the conjugated verbal form. If true questions (as opposed to semiquestions),
they may be preceded by the interrogative particle ea, which may in turn be
preceded by scrambled material. Some examples will be given in
4.4.5.1.2.2.","[511, 512]"
"The facts concerning the distribution of negation in imperatives square well
with typological generalizations concerning other languages, such as the
Romance languages (Zanuttini 1997, chapter 4). Pre verbal negative markers
that can negate a clause by themselves are incompatible with lexical verbs
in the imperative form, although they are compatible with auxiliary verbs in
the imperative form and with verbal forms from other verbal paradigms,
such as the subjunctive, used as imperatives (cf. Spanish).",[551]
"There is considerable dialectal variation in the use of ohi, which ranges from
a modal particle to a semiauxiliary. The main reason to deal with this aspec-
tual particle along with modal particles is that, in eastern dialects, it is asso-
ciated with inflection and moves along with it in cases like negation:
322 Morphology

      neg     AUX.COMP enough care.C0M readJMPF
      'that they do not usually read with enough care' [Etch. 1:70]   Western dialects are less systematic in this respect, but as noted in
Euskaltzaindia (1987), ohi is not associated with the inflection but with the
perfective participle in negative clauses:(484) Ez da     hara joan ohi.
      neg AUX there go
      'S/he does not usually go there.'","[351, 352]"
"The sequence negation+constituent must be distinguished from the se-
quence constituent+negation. The latter seems a bona fide case of sentential
ellipsis (see Laka 1990). There are a number of differences among the two
constructions. First, the former, but not the latter, licenses negative polarity
items:
                                                                 Negation   561

          'Xabier showed up, but otherwise, nobody did.'
       b. Xabier etorri da, *baina bestela ez inor.","[590, 591]"
"There is however some disagreement as to whether these emphatic elements
may occur in focus position in negative clauses. The grammar sketch from
the Academy of the Basque language (Euskaltzaindia 1987:84) claims em-
phatic pronouns are excluded from that position, while Osa (1990:212) finds
them acceptable in certain environments. In the dialect described here, such
elements may in fact be found in non-focal positions, whether in positive or
negative sentences. Therefore, sentences like the following, where an ele-
ment in quasifocus position to which the emphatic marker -xe has been at-
tached, are also acceptable:
 514   Syntax

           Ί won't bring it to you right now, but tomorrow.'(e). Both focus positions may be filled simultaneously:(1047)     JONEK           ez         du      INOR          ikusi.
           Jon.ERG not AUX anyone see
          'It is Jon that has not seen ANYONE.'","[543, 544]"
"Partitive. From the point of view of its syntactic distribution, the partitive is
a subtype of absolutive inflection. Partitive-marked noun phrases occur as
direct object and intransitive subject in polarity contexts such as negative,
interrogative or conditional sentences: ez dut zakurrik ikusi Ί haven't seen
any dogs', zakurrik ikusi duzu? 'have you seen any dogs?' zakurrik ikusten
baduzu, esan 'if you see any dogs, say so'. Other uses of the partitive are
described in section 3.1.2.4.",[215]
"
3.1.2.4. The partitiveMany textbooks classify the partitive affix -ik as a case-form, but in fact this
-ik cannot be added to a full NP with a determiner, but only to a determiner-
less sequence of the type called an N-bar in some theoretical frameworks;
here, therefore, we treat it as a determiner, but a rather special one, since a
partitive NP cannot take any further overt case-marking. The partitive is a
polarity item, and it occurs chiefly in polarity contexts, in positions in which
an absolutive would otherwise occur (see de Rijk 1972a). The main polarity
contexts are listed below:(a) Negative clauses. Partitives occur regularly as the direct object or intran-
    sitive subject of a negated verb:(82) a. Ez dugu/daukagu ogi-rik.
        not have           bread.PRTT
        'We don't have any bread.'(83) b. Gaur ez da hemen ume-rik            jaio.
        today not AUX here       baby.PRTT be.bom
        'No baby has been born here today.'",[154]
"If the comparison between prenegative polarity items, downward entailing
quantifiers such as gutxi, and focus operators is significant, then some focus
feature must be involved in those cases.
   The previous restrictions concerning the pre-negative position of polarity
items do not hold in relative clauses:(1167)    inork             inori         egingo     ez    dion
          anybody.ERG       anybody.DAT   do.FUT     not   AUX.COMP
          proposamena
          proposal.DET
         'the proposal that noone will do to anyone'In embedded clauses, there is a mild contrast depending on whether the ne-
gation plus auxiliary complex is preverbal or postverbal. If it is postverbal,
then it behaves as a relative clause, imposing no restrictions on the position
of negative words (1168a). If it is preverbal, it behaves as matrix clauses
(1168b):(1168) a.    [Inork         ezer     erosiko ez duela]
             anyone.ERG     anything buy.FUT not AUX.COMP

            'Jon said that noone will buy anything.'
         b. Ί [Inork ezer ez duela erosiko] esan du Jonek.",[576]
"
4.10.3.1.2. Word order within the relative clauseThere is a strong word order constraint regarding one constituent within the
relative clause: the relative clause must end with the finite verb form to
which the complementizer is joined. There is no exception to this rule. Even
in negative clauses, where, apart from relatives, the main verb and other
words generally follow the finite auxiliary, the inflected verb must appear at
the end of the relative clause (see 4.5 and 4.10.2.3).
   Consider the following example (a), which contains a negative relative
clause. Within this clause the last word is the inflected auxiliary to which
the complementizer is joined (zuen). The marker of negation (ez), although
written as a separate word in standard Basque, is a proclitic, and must pre-
cede the auxiliary:
                                                              Subordination 767

found in sentences apart from relatives (see 4.5.2.1.2.1). In an ordinary
clause, the unmarked word order for the verbal expression in (a) would be
(b):       b.     Ez zuen          kontutan       hartu.
              no AUX           account.LOC take

"As the examples above show, the dependent clauses are all headed by a
complementizer to which the partitive morpheme is attached. Laka (1992)
proposes that polarity items in dependent clauses are directly licensed by the
complementizer+partitive complex. In fact, the partitive morpheme would
be the phonological spell out of a polar feature that licenses the negative
words and which is selected by the matrix clause. The partitive morpheme,
however, only occurs in a subset of the contexts that license a negative po-
larity item in a dependent clause: epistemic verbs or verbs of speech. In
those contexts, -enik (the complex complementizer+partitive) stands in con-
trast to the simple declarative complementizer, which forces a factive read-
ing of the dependent clause. Subjunctive dependents of verbs of wish and
558   Syntax
command do not take the partitive morpheme, and also allow negative po-
larity items:(1201) a. Ez dut nahi [inor          etor        dadiri].
           not AUX want anyone c o m e ( R A D ) AUX(SUBJ).COMP

                AUX(SUBj).COMP
               Ί didn't order him to buy anything.'","[587, 588]"
"When other negative polarity items follow negation then a 'superiority' ef-
fect arises: only those indefinites whose case-marking corresponds to the
structurally higher function (as compared to the other negative words) can
precede negation. Consider for instance the following contrasts:(1170) a.  Inork       ez du        ezer      erosi.
           anyone.ERG not AUX anything buy

3.6.4. Expressions with ere 'also; even'Ere 'also' is an enclitic to the phrase it modifies: ni ere Ί also', inoiz ere ez

      disposition better.with eatlMPF AUX drink.lMPF
      ere dute gehiago.
      also AUX more
      'They eat with more appetite, and they also drink more.'
      [Duv. L.L.:149]Note, furthermore, that it is also possible to use ere 'also' with topicalized
material, even with verbs:

      and long not get       get also
      'We can get what we do not have now, and even get it before long.'
      [Mitx. EIG VI: 134]    Ere is also used in negative sentences: ni ere ez naiz joango herrira Ί
will not go to the village either'. Curiously, with this negative value in older
texts we find the expression hain gutxi 'neither, not either', lit. 'so little',
which appears to be a direct caique of Sp tampoco: ez dut beldur beroa,
hain gutxi izotza Ί don't fear the heat, and neither the ice'. This expression
is somewhat archaic or literary nowadays.
    In elliptical affirmative sentences ere is optionally but frequently fol-
lowed by bai 'yes':(495) Jon herrira         joango da bihar           eta ni ere (bai).
      Jon village.ALL go.FUT A U X tomorrow and I too (yes)
      'Jon will go to the village tomorrow and I will too.'","[355, 356, 357]"

       'Why not beg her to lend her some jewels?' [Atx. 06.:219]In the first two examples the constituents to the right of the participle could
also have been placed in between the neg+auxiliary unit and the participle.
The third sentence provides an example of a tenseless negative question.
Some dialects occasionally admit negative questions where no split between
the auxiliary and the main verb takes place. Such uninverted negative ques-
tions have a rhetorical flavor. The 'unbroken' negative pattern was more
widespread in older stages of the language.
504 Syntax
   Eastern dialects possess an alternative strategy, whereby only the auxil-
iary is preposed and the negative element appears joined with the participle:(995) Nork             du      liburua     ez     irakurri?
         who.ERG       AUX book            not    read

ther similarities and differences between focus and quasifocus, other than
the semantic and positional differences discussed above.","[541, 542]"
" Verb glosses
Verbal inflection in finite verbal forms is also glossed in detail only where
 directly relevant. Since the only relevant information, outside the chapter on
 verbal morphology itself, is person agreement (including person, case and
number morphemes) only that information is specified. Unless PL 'plural' in
explicitly marked, 'singular' is the default value. We have tried to represent
person agreement information in the order in which it appears on the verb.
Thus, subjects will be variously marked to the right or to the left, depending
on whether they are cross-referenced by the ergative or the absolutive
marker. Person morphemes are separated by slashes from each other in
pluripersonal agreement forms. Mood is only marked when the potential or
hypothetical marker -ke is present or when the subjunctive auxiliary is se-
lected, if directly relevant. Where none of this is relevant, only 'AUX' has
been indicated. Full information is given in 3.5.2.
    As for aspect information, following Basque grammatical tradition, we
gloss perfective participles as infinitives. This is so because they work as
the unmarked, citation form of the verb. Thus, a form like hartu is glossed
as 'take'. Similarly, the future morpheme -ko is added to this citation, parti-
cipial form, and we gloss hartuko as take.FUT, disregarding again the 'per-
fective' aspect marker -tu-. The auxiliary izan 'be' reinforcing perfective
tenses (3.5.4.2.1) or inserted to provide a verbal host for aspectual markers
in verbal locutions (3.5.4.2.2) is always glossed as 'be' regardless of its
grammatical function.
    The perfective present form ikusi dut can be translated as a present per-
fect of simple past in English. Both translations are given for this tense
throughout the grammar. The different tense values are described in 3.5.4.
Finally, some verbal expressions can be analyzed as regular verb+auxiliary

combinations or as noun/adjective + 'be, have' periphrases: bizi naiz Ί live,
be alive', nahi dut Ί want, have desire'. We have maintained the different
authors' preferences in this area.

                             Introduction
                                J. I. Hualde1.1. The Basque language and its nameThe word 'Basque' derives, through French, from the name of the Vas-
cones, a nation or tribe that in Roman times occupied an area of the Iberian
Peninsula including most of present-day Navarre and neighboring parts of
Aragon. Whereas, on the one hand, possibly not all Vascones were Basque-
speaking (both non-Indo-European Iberian and Indo-European Celtiberian
appear to have been used in parts of their territory) and, on the other hand,
Pre-Basque and related languages seem to have been also spoken by some
other neighboring nations (at least the Aquitanians in Gaul, see Gorro-
chategui 1995), in medieval times the name Vascones became identified
with the speakers of the direct ancestor of the language we know as Basque.
The traditional name for the Basque language in Spanish is vascuence, de-
rived from Latin uasconice '(to speak) in the Vasconic way', which is paral-
lel to and was opposed to romance < romanice 'in the Roman way'. In post-
Renaissance Spain, the name vizcaino, strictly speaking only the western-
most dialect of Basque, became for several centuries a frequent designation
for the Basque language and its speakers.
    The Basques call their language euskara (and dialectal variants: euskera,
eskuara, iiskara, auskera, etc.). Euskara is opposed to erdara (or erdera)
'foreign language', used to refer to Spanish on the southern side of the po-
litical border and to French on the other side. Both words have an ending
which very likely derives from the word era 'manner', used as a suffix in
many words, such as ibilera 'way of walking' (from ibil-i 'to walk'), etc. In
erdara the first element appears to be erdi 'half. Etymologically erdara
would thus be 'a half way of speaking', 'something that is not fully a lan-
guage'; a not unusual way to characterize a foreign language. On the other
hand, the original meaning of the root eusk- in euskara is less clear. Among
the proposed etymologies we find the name of the Ausci, a Pyrenean tribe in
Roman times, and the reconstructed verb *enau(t)s-i 'to speak' (Irigoyen
1977, 1990).
2 Introduction
    Basque speakers refer to the land where their language is spoken as
Euskal Herria (euskal = compositional form of euskara + herri 'country' +
-a 'singular determiner') 'country of the Basque language' and to them-
selves as euskaldunak 'those who have the Basque language' (euskal- +
-dun 'possessing' + -ak 'plural determiner').
   In the first decades of the 20th century, the eminent Basque politician and
not-so-eminent philologist Sabino Arana Goiri (1865-1903) and his follow-
ers changed the spelling to euzkera in the (mistaken) belief that this word
must be related to eguzki (dialectal euzki) 'sun', on the Classical Greek
model that sought a connection between Hellen and helios. Related coinages
of that vintage are the words Euzkadi 'Basque Country', later reformed as
Euskadi, the adjective euzko (later eusko) 'Basque, in an ethnic or political
sense' and euzkotar (later euskotar) 'Basque citizen; ethnic Basque'. The
truly great and very influential Basque linguist Luis Michelena (in Basque
Koldo Mitxelena) promoted the use of some of these neologisms to preserve
the traditional link between euskal and the Basque language. His wish was
to avoid the misuse of words like euskaldun, which traditionally can only
mean 'Basque speaker', as 'Basque citizen'. He succesfully campaigned for
terms like Eusko jaurlaritza 'Basque government' instead of Euskal jaur-
laritza, which in the Sprachgeflihl of traditional Basque speakers could only
mean something like 'Government of the Basque language' (see Michelena
1984).","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]"
"Laka (1990) accounts for the difference between unmarked and negated sen-
tences transformationally, by making the auxiliary move to the left edge of
the sentence and adjoin to the negation head originating there. This linear
relation between the basic elements of the sentence has a structural corre-
late. Negation in Basque can be shown to be structurally higher than the
minimal sentential constituent (the minimal constituent containing both the
                                                                       Negation 519
subject and the finite auxiliary). Laka adduces two pieces of evidence in fa-
vor of this structural position. The first piece of evidence is provided by the
fact that sentential negation in Basque licenses subject polarity items (unlike
in English, for instance). Under the assumption that this sort of licensing re-
quires the licenser (negation) to be in a position higher than the polarity
item, or instead to be in a local relation of agreement, the facts show that
negation sits in a higher position than the case marked subject in cases such
as (1072):(1072) a. Ez da     inor             etorri.
          not AUX anybody            come
          'Nobody came.'
       b. Ez du     inork                   erosi.
             not   AUX   anybody.ERG        buy
             'Nobody bought it.'","[548, 549]"
"As with negative polarity items, some speakers also admit partitives under
epistemic modals (from de Rijk 1996b):(1182) a.  Beharbada, entzungo dut albiste               onik.
           perhaps       hear.FUT AUX news               good.PRTT
           'Perhaps I will hear good news.'
        b. Agian aurkituko dut         ezagunik.
             maybe      find.FUT     AUX    known.PRTT
             'Perhaps I will find someone I know.'",[581]
"
4.4.7.2.2. Further differences and similarities between negative foci and
           quasifociIn this section we will examine whether the grammatical phenomena that
can affect foci in positive contexts may affect negative foci and quasifoci in
similar ways.(a). Pied piping. This is available with foci in pre- and post-auxiliary posi-
tions:(1036) BEHIN ERE ez zuela                jomugan jotzen       egin
        once also not AUX.COMP target               hit.IMPF do
        zuen amets.
        AUX dream
       'He dreamed that he did not hit the target EVEN ONCE.'",[542]
"This asymmetry is also related to the semantic interpretation of the negative
words. Polarity items which are clearly existential cannot occur preceding
the negative:(1164) a. Ez da        ezer     askorik  gertatu.
          not AUX anything much.PRTT happen
          'It didn't happen much.'
       b. *Ezer        askorik     ez da  gertatu.
            anything much.PRTT not AUX happen
          '(?)Not much happened.'",[575]
"
4.5.4.3. Negative quantifiersThe cases discussed in (1162-1166) are directly related to the following
ambiguity in multiple polarity word clauses:(1175) Inork        ez du       ezer     ere    egin.
       anyone.ERG not AUX anything at.all done
       'Nobody did anything.'
       'Nobody did nothing.' (>someone did something)It seems as if Basque indefinites could be used as either polarity items or
universal quantifiers (they are also licensed in second terms of compara-
tives, where an existential reading is impossible, see section 4.5.4.1). The
ambiguity of the previous example is linked to two different intonations.
The intonation corresponding to the polarity reading has a main prominent
accent on inork 'nobody' and a secondary accent on preverbal ezer (typi-
cally, preverbal elements receive an accent, realized via stress in most dia-
lects). In the universal quantifier interpretation, both inork and ezer have an
equally prominent accent. The intonation pattern is similar to one with focus
and a quasifocus (de Rijk 1996b; see 4.4.7.2.1):(1176)   JONEK       ez du      BERE anaia        bisitatu.
         Jon.ERG not AUX his            brother visit
         'It is Jon who didn't visit ms brother.'",[578]
"Some dialects possess overt morphological markers for yes/no questions,
such as G al or eastern (LN, Z, R and Sal), -a; the former is a verbal particle
(3.5.7), while the latter occupies the same position as complementizers
(3.5.7.3). -a is restricted to direct questions, while al may also be found in
embedded contexts:(819)    Gure literaturak       aurrerakada   haundirik  egin    al
         our     literature.ERG improvement great.PRTT make al
         du     urte hauetan?
         AUX year these.in
        'Has our literature made any great improvements in the last years?'
        [Mitx. EIG 1:96](820)    Oro egin eta desegin, et          dea lur      huntako legea?
         all    do   and undo       not is.a earth this.of        law
        'To do and undo everything; isn't that the law of this world?' [Etch.
        Id. 1:336]There are also syntactic means to mark clauses as direct questions, in par-
ticular verb fronting:
468 Syntax
(821) Baretuko       ote lituzke zertxobait erdal-euskal
       appease.FUT Q AUX         a.bit       Spanish-Basque

      'Would a Spanish-Basque dictionary appease the controversies a bit?'

        say.FUT     al    AUX         something     finally

        their     language
       'Have you heard how our neighbors from Beam themselves praise
       their language?' [Etch. Id. 1:200]The last two examples show that verb-fronting may cooccur with the inter-
rogative particle al as well as the yes/no marker -a. As usual, a clause-initial
verb may be preceded in turn by any number of topicalized/scrambled ele-
ments and a focalized constituent. Since subjects tend to be topics and ob-
jects are often focalized (see Hualde et al.1994), this means that it is not
clear whether SOV sentences like the following exclusively involve inter-
rogative intonation on a neutral word order or whether the object has been
focalized:(824) Baina       entzuleak       egilearen      esan-rtahi    berbera
        but       listener.ERG    author.GEN     meaning       same

                                                                 Focalization 469Verb-fronting is perhaps more clearly perceived in yes/no questions with
synthetic verbs. These are clitic-like elements which lean on the element to
their left and which cannot therefore occur in absolute initial position in a
main clause. Where verb-fronting to that position takes place, they are sup-
plemented by the particle ba to their left:(826)    Ba al dugu musikan euskal         eskolarik?
         ba al have music.in Basque school.PRTT
        'Do we have any Basque school in music?' [Mitx. EIG 1:49](827) Ba      al   duzue    idazlanik            aski?
         ba   al   have     manuscript.PRTT    enough
        'Do you have enough manuscripts?' [Mitx. EIG 1:83]Topics may occur to the left of the initial verb, which will then also appear
with ba- (828); however, this is not the case if a focalized constituent pre-
cedes it: that constituent 'counts' as first element to support the synthetic
verb, as in (829):(828) Euskal doinuek       ba al dute        berezkotasunik?
       Basque songs.ERG ba al have peculiarity.PRTT
      'Do Basque songs have any peculiarities?' [Mitx. EIG 1:48](829)   Kaltegarritzat     al daukazue   joera           hori?
        harmful.as         al   have      tendency       that
        'Do you consider that tendency harmful?' [Mitx. EIG 1:86]
4.4.3.2. Verb FocalizationVerb focalization stands out from the main focalization strategy described
in the preceding sections in that it seems to employ, at least in part, different
mechanisms. Since Altube (1929), a distinction has been drawn between
two types of 'verb focalization': a) cases where the event itself is empha-
sized, contrasting it with other type of events, and b) cases where 'the posi-
tive or negative quality of the verb is emphasized', i.e. where what is em-
phasized is that the action or state did take place or is true, as opposed to not
taking place or not being true. A priori, the contrastive overtones of the for-
mer seem more akin to the types of constituent focalization discussed in
section 4.4.2, while positive verbal emphasis falls fully in line with the
yes/no questions discussed in 4.4.3.1 However, both types of verb focaliza-
470 Syntax
tion will be discussed in this section in order to prevent dispersion and to
facilitate a sharper distinction between the two. Contrastive event focaliza-
tion will be dealt with in 4.4.3.2.1, and 4.4.3.2.2 will be devoted to polar
emphasis. Since negation presents additional problems which will be exam-
ined in section 4.4.7 below, we will concentrate here on positive polar em-
phasis.","[497, 498, 499, 500]"
"In eastern varieties, a case-suffix may occasionally follow the reinforcing
ere, as in nehoneretik ez 'from nowhere at all', in place of nehondik ere ez-
    Basque has no negative pronouns or related forms, and these are ex-
pressed by combining the items in this third group with ez 'not', as in the
examples just given: inor ez 'nobody', ezer (ere) ez or deus ez 'nothing',
inola (ere) ez 'in no way', and so on. Exception: in eastern varieties, deus or
its extended form deusik can be used in isolation to express 'nothing', with-
out ez\ the same is not true of ezer.
    A negative may take a diminutive suffix, as in ezertxo ere ez 'absolutely
nothing'.
    An indefinite of the ezer type may be followed by guti ~ gutxi 'few, lit-
tle' to express 'hardly any...': inor gutxi 'hardly anybody', ezer gutxi 'hardly
                                                             The noun phrase   157anything'. A case-ending follows, as in Inor gutxik daki hori 'Hardly any-
body knows that'.
   The interrogative nor 'who' functions as an indefinite meaning 'the one,
the person' in locutions like this:(124) Μ ez naiz nor       hori egiteko.
      I not am      who that          do.NOM.REL

"
4.5.7. Negative coordinationNeither...nor... constructions are formed with sentential negation taking
various possible scopes: over noun phrase subject and objects (1216b,
1219), verbal items (1217), and verb phrases (1218), and adjectival predi-
cates (1216a). As some examples show, the first negation can be ellided if it
is under the scope of without (1216b) or a clausemate negation (1217,
1219).(1216) a.  Chile sutu           duten      tankeak ez

         sional windstorms will get to bring down from the heart of the

negation appears to be identical in cases where either the two terms of the
conjunction are introduced by negation, or only the second one is:(1220) a.    Ez    du     [katurik        ez        zakurrik]    ikusi.

             'He didn't see neither dogs nor cats.'","[592, 593]"
"
4.4.3.2.2. Positive polar emphasisVerbal forms with positive emphasis are fronted to the left of the clause
(where, as usual, they may be preceded by any number of topicalized ele-
ments). In addition, they also receive focal stress. In this type of focaliza-
tion, synthetic forms appear with the prefix ba:(834) Jonek       badakar     hori.
       Jon.ERG ba.brings that
      'Jon is bringing that.'
472   Syntax
As indicated above, the usage of this particle seems to be a reflection of the
clitic status of synthetic forms, which usually lean on a host to their left.
Such element is missing in clause-initial position, and the particle ba is then
used to support the conjugated verbal form. From this perspective, this par-
ticle typically appears as a consequence of verb-fronting, rather than as a
marker of focalization per se. At least since Altube (1929), it has often been
assumed that the particle ba itself is the marker of positive emphasis, an
analysis supported by the relation of this element to the positive particle bai
'yes'. However, this does not explain its restriction to synthetic verbal forms
and, more importantly, disregards the usage of ba in other contexts where
verb fronting takes place, such as yes/no questions (see section 4.4.3.1
above) and existential sentences like the following:(835) Bada Sein Floreten Pillardit izeneko fraile

       preaching one
      'There is in St. Floret a preaching friar called Pillardit.'
      [Lertx. O.P.:390]Sometimes different factors may be combined: in the last example there
could be a contrastive emphasis on the existential verb. See Oyhar^abal
(1984), Rebuschi (1982) for more details on this particle.
   The absence of ba makes positive emphatic analytical forms less con-
spicuous, and Altube (1929:57) claimed that these are exclusively marked
by focal stress. Euskaltzaindia (1985) points out verb initiality as an impor-
tant syntactic property. However, given the availability of scrambling to the
left of the clause, this property is often anything but salient. Some examples
are given below:(836) Eta      bukatu    zuten gizonek      beren     lana.
        and    finish    AUX      men.ERG   their     work
       'And the men did finish their work.' [Atx. 06.:39](837) Joan      dira    enarak,    hasi     da      negua.
        go      AUX     sparrows   begin    AUX     winter
       'The sparrows have left, winter has begun.' [Atx. 0&.:43]Note that, even though the traditional description of sentences like these in
Basque grammars assigns them 'contrastive' positive focus, most of these
patterns with analytical verbs seem to be merely emphatic and not contras-

clear in exhortative and imperative sentences, where, if no other element is
focalized, the verb is often preposed (Euskaltzaindia 1985:33):(838)    Ekin    diezaiogun,   beraz,      bigarren   pasarteari.

        'Let's, therefore, focus on the second paragraph.' [Atx. Ob. 30](839)    ...zu joan zaitez errotara eta gelditu zaitez han,

         and send(RAD) AUX daughter as.soon.as.possible
        'As for you, go to the mill, and stay there, and send your daughter as
        soon as possible.' [Atx. Ob.:33]A heavily emphatic positive contrastive focus is found in a marked and ap-
parently archaic strategy like the following, where only the auxiliary has
been preposed:(840) Badut     ikusi\
       ba.AUX see
      Ί HAVE seen.'","[501, 502, 503]"

4.10.1.1.4. The negative complementizer -enikThe occurrence of this negative complementizer, restricted for most part to
the western and central (Bizkaian and Gipuzkoan) dialects, is triggered by
the presence of negation (overt or covert) in the main governing clause:(1471) Bi      udaltzainek           ukatu dute        bidaian
         two   policemen.ERG         deny      AUX     trip.LOC
         Rubioren     bizkartzain izan zirenik.
         Rubio.GEN bodyguard be           were.enik
        'Two police officers have denied that they had been Rubio's body-
        guards during the trip.' [Egunk. 1999/2/24]   As the reader can check, example (1471) is exactly the same as (1445)
except for the difference in complementizer; examples (1445) and (1471)
are worth noting in this regard because they are both taken from the same
newspaper article: while the writer chose the suffix -ela for the headline, she
or he chose the suffix -enik for the main body of the article. Nevertheless,
they seem for the most part to be equivalent; the former is valid in every
non-interrogative context, whereas the latter would be restricted to the do-
main of a governing negative verb.

         it should'] [Mitx. EIG 1:137-8](1473) Et        dugu    horrenbestez              esan      nahi         berarekin

         [Mitx. EIG 1:138]   As Laka (1990:213, citing Saltarelli 1988) has pointed out, within the
same dialect, a governing negative verb may accept a finite clause headed
by both -ela or by -enik, but there will be a difference in presupposition:
when headed by the former, the speaker presupposes that the proposition
expressed by the finite clause is a true fact, but no such presupposition is
made when headed by -enik (Laka 1990:214):(1474)    Gure      alabak            et      du         sinesten                lurra
