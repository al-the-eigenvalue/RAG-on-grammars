preceding verb, verb predicate or clause. Since neither its position nor function
differs from adverbs, the negative particle can also be analyzed as an adverb. As in
(14a), the negative particle occurs as the last word of the verb phrase and may be
separated from the verb by verb complements or adjuncts. The negative particle
may also negate an adverb of manner as in (b) or a prepositional phrase functioning
as an adverb as in (c).",[280]

14.1      Introduction
In the previous chapters, various morphemes have been shown to be distinct in form.
We now present many of the same morphemes in their syntactic context to show
their function. Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb
forms are shown to be syntactically distinct. In non-verbal clauses, copular clitics
are shown to take the place of separate copula particles, which are functionally
equivalent but different in form. Relative clauses are morphologically marked for
definiteness and grammatical function, and they receive the marking instead of the
head noun they modify.","[280, 281, 282]"
"14.2 Grammatical function of constituentsNouns function as subjects, objects, indirect objects, or objects of prepositional
phrases. In (1), mɛ̀ɛn̄ ‘youth’ has the role of agent and functions as the subject of
the clause. The noun nāmsá ‘food’ has the role of a theme, functioning as an object,
whereas mə̄əð̄ ə́n ‘grandfather’ is the recipient and indirect object.(1)    mɛ̀ɛn̄        māār-sá           nāms-á       mə̄əð̄ =ə᷇n
       youth.leader /mar/buy-COMP food-DEF grandfather=DAT
       ‘The youth leader bought the food for the grandfather.’Case marking does not occur on subject or object nouns, but dative nouns take the
clitic =A᷇n as shown in (1) and (2) and have the role of beneficiary or recipient. In
(2), the noun kááy-ɛ̄ɛḡ g=ɛ́ ‘night-PL=RDM’ functions as the object of the general
preposition ɛ́ (GP).(2)    ɔ̀      ná     bɛ́r-s=āná            ɲālg=a᷇n            ɛ́    kááy-ɛ̄ɛḡ g=ɛ́
       and REL explain-COMP=PAS small.ones=DAT GP night-PL=RDM
       ‘ . . and that which is explained (fable) to children at night.’Objects and indirect objects are verb complements, whereas prepositional phrases,
locative phrases and adverbs are verb adjuncts. In (2), the prepositional phrase ɛ́
kááyɛ̄ɛḡ gɛ́ ‘at night’ is an adjunct to the verb bɛ́rsāná ‘explain’ expressing time. In
(3), the locative phrase ūfú ɔ́ɔĺ ‘in the tree’ and adverb d̪ɛɛ̄ n̄ ɛ̄ ‘only’ are both adjuncts
to the verb àn ‘stay’ expressing location.

       Baggara-DEF search-CONT.P girl-PL REL.PL young-PL=RDM
       ‘The Baggara (people group) were kidnapping young girls.’ (Minj2)As shown in (5), verb complements—objects and indirect objects—immediately
follow the verb, and adjuncts follow verb complements. Adverbs are least
connected with the verb and the most moveable of the adjuncts, sometimes being
fronted before the verb, although not usually before the subject. When more than
one kind of adverb is present, manner and directional adverbs normally precede
adverbs of place, time, and other adverbs. Negation markers can be analyzed as
adverbs, since they follow the verb and its adjuncts and have the same function as
adverbs. They are always sentence-final and cannot be fronted before the verb as
some adverbs can.","[282, 283]"
"Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb forms are
syntactically and morphologically distinct and combine in nearly all possible ways.
318                               A grammar of GaahmgIn non-verbal clauses, copular clitics may take the place of separate copula particles,
which are functionally equivalent but differ in form. Relative clauses are
morphologically marked for definiteness and grammatical function in place of the
marking on the head noun they modify. Subordinate clauses are morphologically
marked clause-finally, and the verbs of subordinate clauses can also be marked
according to the type of subordinate clause. Interrogative clauses attach the agented
passive when an agent is post-verbal, the clause-final subordinate when any of the
interrogative pronouns are pre-verbal, and the verb-final subordinate when an
interrogative pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal.

Ten texts of various genres are presented to show Gaahmg morphology and syntax
in the context of natural language. There are two folk narratives, two historical
narratives, two personal narratives, a conversation, an expository text, and two
persuasive texts. The texts were originally recorded on cassette, transcribed, and
glossed by speakers of the language, the recordings made from a variety of
individuals in the home area. Later, the texts were extensively checked by the
present author with speakers of the language and revised accordingly.","[318, 319, 320]"
"I express deep appreciation to the Gaahmg people who shared with me their
beautiful language. Hashim Orta Adaw Madal made arrangements for me to work
with language speakers, travelled with me to the Gaahmg home area, and introduced
me to his family and home. Annaim Karaka Farajalla Yasin was an enormous help
in data collection, tirelessly producing paradigms and checking data. He
demonstrated love and careful thought of his language, and always seemed to
understand why I was probing for certain data. My thanks also to Safadin Hamid
Ateeb who faithfully assisted in data collection. There are many other language
speakers who assisted in other ways to whom I don’t know how to adequately
express my thanks.",[6]

Another lexical category—adverbs, describes the action of the clause, the clause
predicate or the entire clause. There is a strong case for both adjectives and adverbs;
different modifiers are normally used to describe verbs than those used to describe
nouns. The adjective wɛ᷇d̪án ‘good.SG’ of (1a) cannot be used in (b) to describe the
verb fīŋə́-d̪ə ̄ ‘hear’, and the adverb mâŋ ‘well’ of (b) cannot be used to describe the
noun sālāām ‘peace’ in (a). Furthermore, the adjective wɛ᷇dá̪ n agrees in number with
the noun it modifies, whereas the adverb maŋ is unchangeable, and therefore not a
noun or any other word category with number distinction.(1a)    sālāām ɛ́     t ̪ɛ́l wɛ᷇d̪dá̪ n
        peace    GP God good.SG

       ‘Let them hear this message well!’ (Womn25)In this chapter, all attested words are presented which have the function of
describing the action of the clause, the clause predicate or the entire clause. These
words which are lexically categorized as adverbs can be grouped semantically
according to manner, direction, place, time, or none of these. Adverbs of manner,
direction, and place always follow the verb, whereas other adverbs are moveable
outside of the verb phrase and may occur before the verb. When more than one kind
of adverb is present, it is most common for manner and directional adverbs to
precede adverbs of place, time, and other adverbs. The negative particle can also be
analysed as an adverb since it has the same function as adverbs and always occurs
clause-finally.","[274, 275, 276]"

clauses have the same construction as equivalent declarative clauses except for the

(17). In this concluding sentence of a narrative where a fox and hyena try
throughout to capture and eat him, the devil creature is fronted in order to emphasize
him as being the victor.(17)   ɲɛ́ɛŕ ɛ̀mà=

       ‘The nyeerma, at that time, went on laughing.’ (Nyee34)In the first line of the Fandi text, the main participant is marked as being salient, or
most important, by fronting it. The noun subject Fə́nd̪ì-n which normally follows
the subordinate conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ is sentence-initial.(18)   fə́nd̪ì=n    ɛ́ gārá    d̪àɔ̀-s=ə᷅          mɔ̀rāā-gg=ɛ᷇=nɛ́
       Fandi=DEF GP when fight- COMP=IPF government-PL=ACM=SBO
       ‘When Fandi fought with the government, . . ’ (Fand1)Objects are brought into focus by moving them to a pre-verbal position. The object
mii-n ‘chicken’ in (19) is out of its normal post-verbal position to emphasize that it
is the ‘chicken’ being thrown away and not the ‘goat’.(19)   mīí=

       ‘The chicken I am throwing away.’ (Jafr11)In (20), the relative clause, describing a certain group of women, and functioning as
the recipient of the transitive verb /gàf/ ‘give’, is brought to the beginning of the
sentence. The meaning is ‘It is those kinds of women and not others whom God
blesses.’(20)   nà    a᷆n              gg=

passive clitic attached to the verb. The sentence of (21) is the concluding remark of
a personal story where a creature repeatedly tries to attack the narrator and other
participants. The construction emphasizes the outcome of the object ɟāām

Gaahmg is a morphologically rich language, employing many suffixes and clitics on
nouns, adjectives, and verbs. [ATR] quality and tone distinguish a significant
number of lexemes and grammatical functions. Several specific processes of
consonant weakening, vowel elision, [+ATR] spreading, [+round] spreading, and
morphological tone rules, account for the vast majority of alternations when
morphemes are combined.","[315, 316, 317, 318]"
"The normal completive form by itself is a statement of certainty. It states that it is
certain the action is completed. Uncertainty in the completive form is indicated by
the particle lā and optionally by the clause-final subordinate clitic =É. Both
degrees of certainty in the completive are shown in (59).",[302]
"9.11 Causative
A causative verb is used to indicate the reason or initiative of the action being a
different argument than that which does the action. In other words, it expresses that
there is an external causer and adds an argument to the clause. In the causative
continuous form of (60a) with causative suffix -d̪+A, the subject verbal noun tī̪ f ə᷇n
‘tying’ causes the būŋu᷇rgə́ ‘youth’ to sit. The root verb /káàm/ ‘work’ in the
causative completive form of (b) with suffix -s+A means ‘bother’. In (c), the simple
completive verb cúrsū ‘tie’ is compared with the causative completive form of the
same verb cu᷇rsū ‘tie’ in (d), which functions as a speech act of giving a command.
Although the causative completive suffix -s+A attaches in (d), the only difference is
a tone change on the root.",[207]

Khartoum. From April 2004-April 2008 the author continued field work in
Khartoum as a language research associate of the University of Khartoum, Institute
of African and Asian studies. The primary language resource persons for this period
were Hashim Orta Adaw Madal, Safadin Hamid Ateeb, and Annaim Karaka
Farajalla Yasin. All three are from the town of Soda, have spoken the Jog Tao
dialect from childhood, and continue to speak it whenever they are with other
speakers of the language. After April 2008, access to speakers was limited to two
three-week trips to Kurmuk in southern Blue Nile Province, near the home area.
The primary language resource person for this trip was Annaim Karaka Farajalla

agrees in number with the head noun it follows. Relative clauses have been attested
to modify noun subjects as in (48), objects as in (49), and copular complements as in

The relativizer ná/nà can also be used pronominally as in (51).(51)   nà      āgg bìɟɟə̀ dáāgg ɛ́ ɲə̄ə̄gg=í
       REL.PL  1pN left       two      in behind=SBO
       ‘Those which we left behind . . ’ (Thng7)Relative clauses differ from subordinate clauses in the conjunctions introducing the
clause, in the clause-final clitics, and in marking for definiteness. As will be
discussed in 15.2, the subordinate conjunctions ɛ́ gārá ‘when, while’, ɛ́ kɔ̄rá
‘because’, (ār) ‘if’, wàr ‘but’ introduce subordinate clauses instead of the relativizer
ná/nà. As shown in 7.7 and 8.3.8, the clause-final subordinate clitic is always =É
with High tone, whereas the relative clause clitic agrees in number with the head
noun =É/=È. Finally, subordinate clauses are not distinguished for definiteness,
but many relative clauses are.","[297, 298]"
"1.1    Gaahmg languageAt the request of speakers, the name of the language is written orthographically with
the grapheme /aah/ for the long vowel [əə]. The language name is pronounced
[gə̀ə̀mg], meaning ‘people of the Gaam or Ingessana Hills’. Other names for the
language include Ingessana, Gaam, and Tabi. Ingessana is a name given by Arabs.
Gaam is the word for hill, and Tabi is a hill name in the home area (Bender 1980:4).",[16]
"Similarly, the incompletive verb by itself is also a statement of certainty. It states
that it is certain the action is ongoing or for certain will be ongoing. Adding the
uncertainty particle lā before the incompletive verb or attaching the clause-final
subordinate clitic =É indicates uncertainty in the future. With either marker, the
other marker is optional.",[303]
"Attested adverbs of place are listed in (7). The same three-way distinction as in
demonstratives in 8.1.3—near a speaker, near an addressee, and away from both
speaker and addressee—also occur in adverbs, as well as a presentational adverb as
in (6c).",[278]
"Finally, I thank God with a heart full of gratitude, for He is surely my help, and “the
One who sustains me” (Psalms 54:4).

Gaahmg (Gaam, enthologue code [tbi]) is a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic language
spoken in the Ingessana Hills of the Blue Nile Province of North Sudan, near the
Ethiopian border. For centuries, the Gaahmg people have fought off invaders
entering their hills. Even today, their culture and language have been less influenced
by outsiders than those of other ethnic groups in the Blue Nile Province. Although
Gaahmg speakers outnumber speakers of other languages in the area, little
documentation has been done of their language. This work presents a description of
Gaahmg grammar, including its phonology, morphology, and syntax.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"Texts were recorded on cassette, transcribed, and glossed by speakers of the
language, the recordings made from a variety of individuals in the home area.
Natural clauses were taken from the texts as frames for eliciting nouns and verbs
with various morphemes. The cards were again used to elicit multiple nouns, verbs,
and adjectives in the frames.",[19]

Only the interrogative pronouns of (6b-e) agree in number with the noun phrase
which they replace. Some interrogative pronouns have a marked form when they
replace words which occur in an uncommon position in the clause, but are otherwise
unmarked. Other interrogative pronouns only have one form regardless of its
position in the clause. When any of the interrogative pronouns are pre-verbal, the
clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO) of 7.7 and 8.3.8 attaches sentence-finally.
When an interrogative pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal, the verb-final
subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) of 10.7 is attached to the verb.","[311, 312]"
"The original data set of nouns and verbs were taken from word lists entered into
dictionary software by speakers of the language, which became the Gaahmg-English
Dictionary (Madal 2004). The singular and plural forms of nouns and subjunctive
and completive forms of verbs were written on cards and glossed in English and
Arabic. The cards were sorted numerous times to isolate segments and tone in the
same environments, and each time speakers read the words on the cards.",[19]
"9.2      InfinitiveInfinitives are the most common form used in foregrounded nuclear clauses of
narratives, i.e. sequences of events. As such, they often encode actions that can be
translated into English as past tense, such as in (11). Infinitives commonly occur
following the infinitive verb dɔ̄ɔs̀ ‘start’ as in (11a), but can follow various other
verb forms and can be the first verb of a clause or sentence.(11a)     ānɛ̄nd̪á ɛ̄       dɔ̄ɔs̀ -s  ɛ̄     bàg

verbs are commonly used in typical non-finite contexts such as ‘want to X’.",[180]

although the multiple suffixes which attach to nouns do not change as much from
speaker to speaker.","[111, 112]"
"Clause-level syntax is presented in chapter 14 to show the functions of morphemes.
Agented passive, passive, antipassive, and causative morphemes are syntactically

also discussed, among other grammatical aspects. Chapter 15 presents sentence-
level syntax, including coordinate and subordinate conjunctions, question clauses,
and subject and object focus. After some concluding remarks in chapter 16, ten
texts of various genres are presented in chapter 17 to verify the morphology and
syntax in the context of natural language.",[21]

Blue Nile Province. The capital of the Ingessena area is Bao (11.350797,
34.083710) and the government offices are in Soda. There are reported to be 78
hills in the area, some rising 300 meters above the surrounding flat plains. While the
plains are grassland with occasional acacia trees, the vegetation in the hills has a
much greater variety of plants and trees, with water sources even in the dry season.

groups in the surrounding geo-political area known as the Funj. In addition to the
related languages of the Aka, Molo, Kelo, and Ben Sheko, there are the Berta,
Gumuz, Oromo to the east, the Burun, Jumjum, Uduk, Mabaan to the south, Dinka
and Nuer to the west, and Sudanese Arabs to the north.","[16, 17, 18]"
"The third singular subjunctive forms of (16d-f) also undergo an assimilation process.
The suffix-initial dental plosive assimilates to ð, r, and w. There are two forms for
plural subjunctives with root-final ð as in (d): the root-final consonant either
assimilates to the suffix consonant as in fɛ́d-̪ d̪ā ‘release’, or the suffix consonant
assimilates to the root-final consonant as in fɛ́ð-ðā ‘release’. In (g), the suffix-

weakens to the vowel ɛ after the suffix vowel a is elided (kɔ́ɛ.́ -ɛ́). This assimilation
process to the root-final ð, r, and w does not always apply for every word with every
speaker, but varies from word to word and from speaker to speaker.","[183, 184]"

post-verbally in a prepositional phrase or in genitive case. The clitic agrees in
number with the encoded agent when in genitive case but not when in a
prepositional phrase. The clitic is called an ‘agented passive (PAS.A)’ marker in this
thesis. It is commonly used when patients or themes are in focus, being pre-verbal.
In agented passive clauses, an explicit agent is required and the encoding of the
agent is required to be post-verbal. Further, the agent is marked as a non-argument,

There is morphological marking in subordinate and interrogative clauses, and a
discussion of sentence-level syntax is needed to understand these morphemes. In
this chapter, we discuss types of clauses in sentences (15.1), coordinating and
subordinating conjunctions (15.2), interrogative structures (15.3), as well as focus
(15.4).","[306, 307, 308]"

prepositional pronouns, locative prepositional pronouns, or inherently possessed
body parts—all of which are vowel-initial.37In (6a), the preposition attaches to the possessive pronoun ɛ̄ ‘his’ of the possessive
phrase to indicate ‘in his chest’. In (b), the preposition attaches to the prepositional
pronoun -a᷇ggá ‘us’ to indicate ‘from us’. In (c), the preposition attaches to the
locative prepositional pronoun -ɛ́ɛɲ́ ‘behind.3sO’ to indicate ‘to behind him’. In (d),
the preposition attaches to the possessed body part noun ɔ̄ɔɲ̄ to indicate ‘on your
back’. In (a,d), the prepositional phrases have the role of location, in (b) the role of
source, and in (c) the role of goal.",[263]
