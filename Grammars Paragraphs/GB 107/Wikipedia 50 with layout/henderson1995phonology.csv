  When imperatives are negated, the postnuclei take the form of those used with indicative
mood proximal tense verbs in the positive. (See Tables 2. 1 .6. 1 . and 2. 1 .6.2).     ( 1 25) a.   Vya       !ll£i.

                  Don't hit them. (second person plural subject)
  Punctiliar verbs which have a strong imperative root (see examples (6 1 ) and (62) and
Table 2. 1 .4.4) do not use the strong root for negative imperatives.     ( 1 26) a.   [K:ilJ L kedi.
                  there stand. up (2SG.IMP)
                  Stand it there.                                       (strong positive imperative)             b.   [K:ilJ L nange                             kfifi.

                  Don't stand it there.                                 (strong negative imperative)
                                                                                            57   It would seem that once an imperative is negated and its prenucleus specified, the rest of
the verb is treated as a 'basic' or 'simple' indicative proximal verb. Thus negative imperative
status is expressed only once in the verb phrase.","[63, 64, 65]"
"   Where events in the past are the REASON for a current and continuing RESULT, the
RESULT clause is marked with awede 'today ' . The following example is from text (d),
sentences 16 and 1 7.
   (252) a .   [Mepe nge] E [ w:aa mbwame] A -
               Mepe      S G . E dog    neck
               me-depe                            chapwo.                            REASON for (b)

               Mepe didn' t c u t its throat,
               so it is still there at Doonge.
(3) MEANS-RESULT   The MEANS-RESULT relationship is similar to the REASON-RESULT relationship,
but MEANS implies that someone intends the RESULT to take place. Example (253) is from
text (d), sentences 1 5 and 1 6.
  (253) a.     [ W:aa] A mJ                       mb€pe wo, -

               bush in
         b.    [Mepe nge] E [ w:aa mbwame] A
               Mepe      S G . E dog    neck
               me-depe                         chapwo.
               again-PI.REM. 3 .SB .NEG cut
               The dog ran into the bush,
               so Mepe wasn't able to cut its throat.
   Another example shows the use of awede 'today' to mark a continuing state arising from
an origin story.
  (254) a.     [Km:i11 A [ntemwintemwl1L dy:aa nge,                                   MEANS of (b)

         b.    [awedel T [km:i11 TOP [ala dyame mb€me wopewopeJL                -               today       coconut      this   island on        everywhere               [daa] NEG [gh€de· lcOM                                                RESULT of (a)

               He sent coconuts to every place,
               so now there are plenty of coconuts all over the island.
(4) MEANS-PURPOSE
   MEANS-PURPOSE is similar to MEANS-RESULT, but the event with the PURPOSE
relationship is intended, not necessarily realised. In Yele the PURPOSE clause is expressed
as an imperative.

                 so that the pig will not eat the chickens.
   Since a negative habitual carries the force of a negative imperative, PURPOSE can also be
expressed with a negative habitual, as in (256b) . (This example is taken from text (b) ,
sentences 1 0 c and d.)
     (256) a .   [Mb:aamb:aa nge] M w-a-nyi                  ye,
                 good           M        D-FUT-2SG.SB put
            b.   [nkuwo]A [u menel L d:uu-dpi                         kee.          PURPOSE of (a)

                 You put it well,
                 so that moisture will not get inside it.
(5) CONDITION-CONSEQUENCE     This relationship is frequently not marked. For example:
     (257) a.    [Mb:aamb:aa nge] M a-nyi                    vyoko,             CONDITION of (b)
                 good            M        FUT-2SG.SB         dry

                 If you dry it well,
                 you 'll get a good price for it.","[89, 90]"

the usual punctiliar root, the corresponding remote past root is used, and the postnucleus
uses forms normally used with the remote past tense. (See Tables 2. 1 .6. 1 and 2. 1 .6.2).",[63]
"   The definite morpheme w- is nearly always used with future questions ( 1 0 1 ), but is not
used with a negative future statement with a first or second person subject. (Compare ( 1 00)
and ( 1 02).)

   In other future indicative forms (i.e. positive questions and statements), its use is
optional. In fact, the meaning of w- is rather difficult to determine in future positive
statements. In some texts it correlates fairly closely with duration, punctiliar events using w-,
continuous events not using it. Compare ( 1 03a) with ( 1 03b).

   Text (b) (a procedural text about copra making) in §2.4 illustrates the difficulty of
determining the function of W-. As stated in §2. 1 .3 (just above example (23», a second
person singular subject form in future tense is used for procedures that people in general
follow. The predicate prenucleus in this case is (w-)a-nyi. An adaptation of the free
translation of that text follows, in which w-a -nyi is represented as w-you and a-nyi as @-you.

involved, and w- is not applicable. The human Agent is involved again in 9a:      9 a     After that w-you ram it.                      PCT                   w

is shipped to market. Again w- is inapplicable, as the generic human is not the Agent of these
predications.

At first sight the use of w-a-nyi or a-nyi in this text seems quite random, one form being
used for several clauses, and then the other form for several clauses. But then a subtle
difference emerges. Sentence 2 refers to any time in general when one would be making
copra, and begins the sequence of operations involved, all without the W-. The switch to
                                                                                                  51using w- comes with sentence 3, which begins with U kuw6 dini ghi nge ' after that ' . The
situation is a little more definite now - the processing has begun and should not be
interrupted until it is completed. And so the clauses through to 5b all use w-a -nyi, but 5c uses
a-nyi, apparently because it refers to some generic prior time at which the firewood should
have been gathered. The definite situation marked with w- is resumed in 9a with further steps
in the copra-making process, until the end of the process is reached in 1 1 a, and the copra is
in the shed on the wharf waiting for shipping to market.
   Sentence 1 4 begins an evaluative paragraph which presents the consequences of
processing copra well or badly, and this more general situation is indicated by the absence of
w-. So far so good. But why is w- used in sentence 1 7 ? Sentence 17 is essentially the same
condition and consequence as are found in 1 5, which does not have W-. It seems that here the
w- is used as a prominence marker, to highlight the responsibility a man has to process his
copra properly. And the w- is continued in sentence 18 to enforce the conclusion.","[57, 58, 59]"

opportunity in a monologue, quoted speech excepted, of course. Text (a) in §2.4 is a good
example.

   Yele ( also referred to as Yela and Yeletnye) is spoken by about 3,300 people, the
inhabitants of Rossel Island in the Milne B ay Province of Papua New Guinea. It is non­
Austronesian, sharing only 6 per cent of cognates with the nearest Austronesian language,
Sudest. (See Henderson and Henderson 1 974.) No close relatives of Yele have been
identified.
   This monograph describes the phonology and grammar of the language, highlighting the
portmanteau orthography and portmanteau interaction of tense, mood and aspect i n
predications. The grammatical description is b y prose statements, the analytical insights
being drawn mainly from Tagmemics and Functional Grammar (Dik 1 978).
  A preliminary description of the Yele language was published in 1 975 ( Henderson 1 975).","[2, 3, 4, 5]"
"
2.1 PREDICAnON  Yele verbs move through a multidimensional array of:
        indicative, imperative and habitual moods, doubled by
        continuous and punctiliar aspect, and multiplied by
        six tenses:
           future, immediate future, present,
           immediate past, near past and remote past.
   The verbs also agree with the person and number of the subject and object. The
morphemes marking all these parameters are merged into portmanteau forms which defy
simple analysis, and contribute to the reputation Yele has of being impossible to learn,
whether by Papua New Guinean or by foreigner.
   The morphemes appended to the verb root - prefixes and suffixes in many languages -
are in Yele separated from the verb root on phonological grounds. Thus a predicate consists
of a prenuclear component, verb root and postnuclear component, each written as a separate
word. Many verb roots vary in form to express the mood, aspect and tense by using
suppletive forms or reduplication. (Some irregular verbs have as many as five different
roots. See §2.1.4 for the details.)
   The verbal prenucleus also expresses the mood, aspect and tense, along with the person
and number of the subject of the predication. (I am using the term 'aspect' in the 'catch-all'
sense, so 'aspect' in this chapter includes more than duration. It also includes the items
elaborated in §2.1.7, such as indefiniteness, commonality and repetition.) It is in the
prenucleus that a number of deictics can be incorporated. (See §2.l.S and §2.1.7).
   With transitive verbs the postnucleus expresses the person and number of the object, but
also reflects the mood, aspect and tense, and often monitors the person and number of the
subject as well. (See §2.1.6).
                                             14
                                                                                                   15   With intransitive verbs, the postnucleus expresses the duration, mood and tense of the
verb, and then the number of the subject. In imperatives, the postnucleus also monitors the
person of the subject. (See Tables 2. 1. 6.1 and 2. 1. 6. 2.)
  The following examples illustrate the Ergative-Absolutive system operating in the clause.
The Ergative referent is marked with <ngb, while the Absolutive referent is unmarked.
   (1)      a.   [Kaawa �] E de                     m:uu teo
                 Kaawa SG.E PLIM.PST.3.SB see               T.PI.PRX.3PL.O.MF
                 Kaawa saw them.                                    (transitive, implicit object)
           b.    [M:aa �] E [Kaawa] A de                         m:uu.
                 Dad SG.E Kaawa          PLIM. PST.3.SB see
                 Dad saw Kaawa.                                          (transitive, explicit object)
  ( 2)           [Kaawa]A [ wune] T de                    dpJ.
                 Kaawa    already PLIM. PST.3.SB fall.asleep
                 Kaawa has already fallen asleep.                                       (intransitive)
   The Ergative-Absolutive system is also illustrated by the way in which indefinite status
(in Chafe' s terms (1976: 38- 43)) is marked. The numeral ngme 'one' is used to mark an
indefinite item in Yele. When the subject of a transitive verb (the Ergative referent) is
indefinite, ngme is added to the noun phrase:
  (3)            [ U dpodo pyu          ngme   nge] E a          nuwo.
                 his work performer INDEF SG.E CLS took. REM
                 One of his workers brought it.
  When the Absolutive referent of the clause is indefinite, this is signalled by prefixing
ngme- or a form derived from it to the predicate prenucleus. Example (4) illustrates this
phenomenon, for an indefinite object, the saw blade:
   (4)           [Saw nt:u] A ngme-nJ                     nuwo.
                 saw body INDEF-PI.REM. l SG.SB took. REM
                 I took a (circular) saw blade.
   If the (Absolutive) subject of an intransitive verb is indefinite, this also causes the
predicate prenucleus to be marked with ngme or a form derived from it:
  (5)            [ Yell PllA     [k.·ook ngme-doo                        dpodo.
                 Rossel person inside INDEF-CI.REM.3SG.SB working
                 There was a Rossel man working on board.
  The morpheme ngme and the forms derived from it are dealt with in more detail in
§2.1. 7. 1.","[22, 23]"
"   It is interesting that knowledge is expressed in Yele with the noun lama as a Location.
   (20 1 )        [Ndende nge] M IJl 1amal L            de-noo                    ya.

                  I don't know where the Post Office is. (lit. The Post Office isn ' t standing in
                  my knowledge.)
With verbs that imply motion away from the current location, the Location expresses the
destination, while with verb stems implying motion towards the current location, it expresses
the point of departure.

   Yele has a number of postpositions which are used to express the Location more
explicitly:
   (205)          [Xi gg       k:oolL dpf                    eM ngme.

  The postpositions are discussed more fully in §2.2.3.

  Where a number of people are referred to in one phrase, as in example (209), the most
important person is placed first, and the speaker places himself last.
     As can be expected, there are pairs of words which have a required order of occurrence.

each item is associated with a different person.

2. 1 .7 SECONDARY FACTORS   That brings to a close the discussion of the basic structures in the predicate. There are a
number of other factors which affect the predicate, all of which have been left unmanifested
in §§ 2. 1 .4, 2. 1 .5 and 2. 1 .6, to keep the complexity of the presentation within manageable
proportions. The following sections will deal with these factors in turn. Some forms of the
morphemes that manifest these factors can be seen easily enough as affixes, but others are
merged into the prenucleus, with confusing results. The factors are as follows, their basic
forms being listed along with them.
     - indefiniteness                ngme­          ( § 2 . 1 .7 . 1 )
     - commonality                   mye            ( §2 . 1 . 7 . 2)
     - repetition                    me             (§2. 1 .7.3)
     - motion                        n:aa           ( §2 . 1 .7 .4)
     - deictic incorporation         various        ( §2 . 1 . 7 . 5 )
     - negation                      daa            ( § 2 . 1 . 7 . 6)
     - contrafactual status          wo. . .pi      ( § 2 . 1 .7.7)
2. 1 .7. 1 INDEFINITENESS
     Where the Absolutive referent of a predication i s indefinite, i n Chafe ' s terms
( 1 976:38-43), this is signalled by prefixing <ngme-> to the predicate prenucleus. The saw
blade in example (65) illustrates an object which is indefinite:
     (65)      [Saw nt:u]A ngme-ni            nuwo.
               saw body INDEF-PI.REM. 1 SG.SB took.REM
               I took a (circular) saw blade.
                                                                                               41   If the subject of an intransitive verb is indefinite, this also causes the predicate prenucleus
to be marked with <ngmo.
   (66)        [N:uU]A ngme        loo?
               who    INDEF went
               Who went?","[48, 49]"
"   Where there is more than one third person referent on stage at a time in a discourse, the
subjects and objects are made explicit more often, to ensure that the hearer can keep track of
the referents of the clauses. (As is often the case, folk stories show less explicit reference to
the participants, because everyone knows who does what in the story, and it is not necessary
to be as explicit. Everyone knows, that is, except the linguist from another culture!). Text (d)
in §2.4 provides an example of a text with more than one third person referent on stage at a
time. It is by the same author as the fishing story referred to above. The topic of the text is a
savage dog, which is introduced and named in clause l a, then referred to with third person
singular verb parts in clause 1 b. The author disclaims responsibility in sentence 2 ,
introducing himself with a pronoun, and using the word 'dog' in sentence 3 . H e names the
culprit, his brother Nkal, with a noun, and uses the word 'dog' again in sentence 4. Nkal ' s
name is repeated i n sentence 5, but this time the other third person referent i s understood to
be the dog, without specific reference. The dog is mentioned again specifically in the next
sentence, number 6. It remains the topic of the rest of that paragraph, sentences 7 to 9, being
referred to only pronominally. Sentence 1 0 begins a narrative episode, in which Mepe and
his son Yidika are introduced by name. In this episode each sentence uses a noun to refer to
one of these actors, as the initiative moves from one third person referent to another in quick
succession. The result of the incident comes in sentence 1 7, but the dog is not mentioned
specifically - it is just the third person singular referent of the verb. The text ends with a
specific reference to a safe road for people to follow.
(2) Order of items in the clause   Apart from the subject and object of the clause, other items can be included at will when
their semantic content is to be made explicit, up to a limit of five items in any one clause,
including the predicate. The histogram in Table 2. 1 .8 . 1 shows the proportion of transitive
and intransitive clauses having each number of items. The histogram is based on a sample of
667 clauses all from texts or conversation.",[66]

   The verb ' give' is a special case, as the verb root used depends on the person of the
recipient (Goal) . Perhaps it should be regarded as two different verbs, ' give to a third
person' and ' give to a first or second person ' . Table 2. 1 .4.5 outlines the different roots
meaning ' give' that are used.

     The main factors affecting the predicate prenucleus are:
         - duration       continuous or punctiliar (see §2. 1 . 1 above)
         - mood           indicative, habitual or imperative (see §2. 1 .2)
         - tense          six tenses in the indicative mood and two in each of habitual and
                          imperative moods (see §2. 1 . 3)
         - person         first, second or third person subject
         - number         singular, dual or plural subject
   The interactions of these parameters are marked by portmanteau morphemes related to the
pronouns, as presented in Tables 2. 1 .5.2 and 2. 1 .5 . 3 below, with following discussion.
That discussion defers consideration of a number of other factors which affect the
prenucleus, such as negation, contrafactual status, motion, included deictics and reference to
one of several objects. All these factors are such that they are only expressed in certain
situations and so to simplify the description of the predicate prenucleus, the forms where
these factors are not expressed will be used in this section. (These factors are described in
detail in §2. 1 .7.)
   The Yele free pronouns are presented in Table 2. 1 .5 . 1 , for comparison with the prenuclei
in Tables 2. 1 . 5 .2 and 2. 1 .5.3.","[41, 42]"

1. 3 SECONDARY PHONEMES
   The founder of prosodic analysis, J.R. Firth (1948:4), rejected the ""tendency to use one
magic phoneme principle within a monosystemic hypothesis"" and applied the term 'prosody'
to a feature extending over more than one segment, such as the voicelessness of the [st]
sequence in English. Grimes (1969: 85-88) outlines the principle of regarding as a
simultaneous prosody any features which pertain to a larger unit than a single segment. In the
transformational mould, Goldsmith (1979) has proposed autosegmental phonology, in
which phonological entities are effective in separate tiers. For example, tones would be in a
separate tier from that covering the consonantal and vocalic segments of utterances. Other
scholars have applied autosegmental phonology to further phenomena, such as complex
segments, vowel harmony and nasalisation, as reported by Van der Hulst and Smith (1982).
I have followed these departures from monosystemic analysis and set up a distinction
between basic phonemes and secondary phonemes. My secondary phonemes are contrastive
modifications which can be handled most economically in a second system, and which can
extend over more than one segmental phoneme. They are analogous to the suprasegmentals
of traditional Phonemics, to Firth's and Grimes' prosodies and to the tiers of autosegmental
phonology. I use the term 'secondary phoneme' rather than 'prosody' as the latter term is the
equivalent in Generative Phonology of the traditional term 'suprasegmentals' (Schane
1973:14). Granting a second system of phonemes opens the door for a simpler and more
concise analysis, and leads naturally to an economical and effective arrangement of the
material to be covered in the primer with which speakers of Yele can learn to read their own
language (Henderson and Henderson 1978). The more basic phonemes are introduced first,
and then the secondary phonemes quickly expand the readers' capabilities.
   Turning now to the secondary phonemes of the Yele language, the eleven basic vowel
phonemes displayed in Table 1.1.1 are augmented by two secondary phonemes, length and
nasalisation. Length is readily accepted as a suprasegmental phoneme along with pitch and
stress in traditional Phonemics. Schane (1973: 14f) lists these three as prosodies. Pike
(1947: 63) regards only these three as suprasegmentals under the premise that only
""quantitative characteristics ... may serve as suprasegmental phonemes"". He also refers in a
bibliographical section to the work of many linguists, from those who regard various other
features as suprasegmentals to those who deny any structurally relevant distinction between
segmental and suprasegmental phonemes (Pike 1960/3:53). Thus length would be regarded
by most linguists as a suprasegmental or as a prosody, so I automatically count it with the
secondary phonemes in Yele. I also regard nasalisation as a secondary phoneme, as it can be
applied to eight of the basic vowel phonemes, and it constitutes alone a causative morpheme:
     [ta y�i]        it fell down
     [ta y�]         he made it fall
                                                                                             13   [ta pWi:]         it came out
   [ta pWJ::]        he made it come out
The secondary phoneme of nasalisation removes the need for a series of eight nasalised
vowels, and nasalisation is taught successfully in a single lesson in the Yele primer
(Henderson and Henderson 1 978: 22- 26).
   If simultaneous bilabial closure can be regarded as a secondary phoneme of consonants
analogous to length and nasalisation of vowels, then the seven simultaneous stops and
continuants demonstrated in Table 1. 2. 4 can be represented as the corresponding non-bilabial
consonants uttered with simultaneous bilabial closure. When prenasalised stops or those with
nasal release are uttered with sirniltaneous bilabial closure, the bilabial closure affects both
the stop and the nasal, as illustrated in Table 1. 2.5.
                                         CHAPTER 2                                        GRAMMAR   Unlike so many Papuan languages in Papua New Guinea, Yele does not have a switch
reference system. Verbs move in a bewildering array of modes and tenses, doubled by an all­
pervasive distinction in duration, and elaborated by the incorporation of deictics into the
verb. Analysis proves difficult, because many of these distinctions are expressed in
portmanteau morphemes, rather than by agglutination. Yele also shows the
monofocallpolyfocal distinction found in some New Guinea Highland languages.
   The order of terms in the clause is SOV. Within the predicate, a modified norninative­
accusative system operates, but the items predicated in the clause follow ergative marking.
The ergative marker used with singular Agents, nge, is homophonous with the Instrument
marker, as in a number of Huon Peninsula languages.","[20, 21, 22]"

Raymond, confirmed that ala used in clause (95a) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (c) and (d), and that its use in clause (g) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). He also said that mu in clause (h) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). Mu seems to be used here rather than ala, because it introduces another
following REASON, as mu is used as a deictic to refer to an 'other' entity. When asked
about yi in clause U), he said it referred to all the previous REASONs. Concerning wu in
(96a) and (96c), he said it referred to the earlier pair of REASONs in (95c) and (95d). There
is a parallel here between the real-world usage of wu to refer to an entity which is out of
sight. The earlier pair of preceding REASONs is 'out of sight' compared with the later pair
of preceding REASONs.
   Five of these deictics have parallels in the predicate prenucleus with similar meanings. For
example, the basic form of the certainty prefix is Ja''.., and its typical use is to indicate that the
speaker was an eyewitness to an event. While kJ- and its variants are used with non-future
indicative events, future indicatives (that is events that have not been ' seen' yet) can be
marked with w- 'definiteness' in the same position in the predicate prenucleus.
( 1 ) Incorporating the deictic kJ
   The incorporation of the other deictics is described in detail below, but first let us examine
kJ- and W-. The basic form kJ- merges into the predicate prenucleus. In the present tense of
continuous events, it takes the form k-, and is used only with third person subjects.

     In the past tenses, the following morphophonemic changes take place:
       kJ + de     --> kede
       kJ + nmJ --> kunu
       kJ + dpJ    --> kudu
       kJ + nmo --> kuno
       kJ remains unchanged elsewhere.

"(3) Incorporating the deictic ala
    The deictic ala ' this' (close to the speaker) has a parallel in a 'close ' , which occurs in the
predicate prenucleus to mark motion towards the speaker or proximity to the speaker.
Although the basic form is a, the morpheme takes a number of different forms, as presented
in the matrices A-7 and A-8 in the appendix. In some cases, a 'close' is added unchanged to
the 'unmarked' predicate prenucleus ( 1 04). (The added a is written as a separate word in the
practical orthography to avoid confusion with a long vowel within a morpheme. Where a
'close' is added, there is a pitch glide from the unmarked prenucleus down to the a, but this
does not occur with normal long vowels.)   ( 1 04) a.      [Maah      w-a       kee             dmi.

   Where the unmarked predicate prenucleus is a short monosyllable, its vowel is lowered or
replaced by a when a 'close' follows.   ( l 06) a.      KJ-dny�                  koko.

   On the paths at Rossel, the two sentences in ( 1 07) can be heard, where the vowel j is
lowered to a, as a mother encourages her young child not to dawdle along. Example ( 1 07a) is
used if the child is ahead of his mother on the path, while ( 1 07b) is used if he is following
her.

2. 1. 2 MOOD
   I am using the term ' mood' to refer to a fuzzy parameter along which Yele makes three
structural distinctions, based on the type of speech act and the specificity of the action. These
distinctions are marked in the verbal prenucIeus and postnucIeus, and even affect the verb
root with some verbs. From the perspective of speech act, Yele makes only one major
distinction, namely that between informational speech and commands. Questions use the
same verb roots and exactly the same prenucIear and postnuclear components as do
                                                                                               19statements. Imperatives differ markedly in form from statements and questions. (Yes-no
questions differ from statements in intonation, and content questions contain a question
word. Otherwise they are the same as statements.) Thus Yele distinguishes morphologically
between informational speech and imperatival speech.
   Within informational speech, Yele distinguishes between reference to specific events in
the past, present or future, as opposed to habitual events that people perform. The reference
to specific events is termed the indicative mood in this paper, while the reference to habitual
events is the habitual mood. Table 2. 1.2. 1 shows these distinctions diagrammatically.","[26, 27]"

2.3.3 QUOTATIONS
   All quotations are direct. There is no indirect speech. Every utterance by the one person is
introduced by a quote formula which specifies when the words were spoken, and the person
and number of the speaker and of the hearer. Typically, each succeeding clause in the
quotation is introduced by a contracted quote formula that gives the person and number of the
speaker and of the person spoken to, and the tense.   (267) a .    [Hughie nge] E ye-pe,

                so they ran away.

                John asked the captain,

                He (John) said,
                ""There' s someone here called Gregory,
                who has come from Samarai.
                I'm looking for him"".
   Another example of dialogue is at text (a), sentences 6 and 7 in §2.4. In sentence 8 of that
text the two following clauses in the quotation are not preceded by the contracted quote
formula, a -ka -de ' he said to me' . It is obvious that the quotation continues, because of the
second person verb parts. This text was originally written, not spoken, and there is a
tendency in written material not to use the quote formulae as frequently as in spoken
discourse.
   Quoted speech is common in narrative, but rare in procedural, hortatory or explanatory
discourse types. Text (d) in §2.4 is explanatory, and contains quoted speech in an embedded
narrative episode (sentences 10 to 1 6) .

   When the noun can be inferred from the context, some relators allow it to be represented
by only a dependent pronoun.

   When the item related to the rest of the clause by the postposition is to be expressed
pronominally, a dependent pronoun from the set displayed in Table 2.2.2. 1 is used.

   A sample of Yele postpositions follows:      vy:o               amongst, in the midst of

      k:oo               into, inside
   The last relator, k:oo, is interesting in that it cannot take any dependent pronoun between a
singular noun and the postposition, and for anaphoric reference when the noun is left
implicit, the postposition is used alone.

762.2.4 WORD CLASS DERIVATION
   Yele has several mechanisms for deriving a word of one class from a word of another
class.
     Adverbs can be derived from verbs or adjectives by the addition of -mbiy:e.                dpodo     -- >   dpodo-mbiy:e
                work             work-adverbialiser
                                 strongly                d:umu     -->    d:ud:u-mbiy:e
                full             full-adverbialiser
                                 fully(D:ud:u is a partial reduplication of d:umu ' full'.)
  A class of words meaning ' for the nth time' is derived from the ordinal numerals by the
addition of -mM.
                pyoio     -- >   pyoio-mM
                three.times      for the third time                podo      -- >   podo-mM
                four. times      for the fourth time
    Adjectives can be nominalised by suffixing with -ni 'specifier' to form a word meaning
' the . . . one ' .
                ndfi      -- >   ndfi-ni
                big              big-SPEC
                                 the big one
                tMe       -->    tMe-ni
                small            small-SPEC
                                 the small one
     Although the doer of an action is usually expressed by the addition of a separate word,
pyu, some words form contractions to indicate the person associated with an item.

"( 1 ) Presence of explicit subjects and objects
    Since the prenuclear and postnuclear components of the Yele verb mark the subject and
object of the predication so fully, these referents are frequently not specified by nouns or
noun phrases. Typically, they are made explicit where they enter a discourse, or where the
referents change, and elsewhere are carried just by the markers in the verb. For example, text
(a) in §2.4 introduces the author in the verbal prenucleus of clause 1 , and thereafter his
identity is carried by the verbal markers. He introduces his brother Nkal by name in clause
6a, and the quote formulae in their conversation keep track of the speakers. Nkal refers to
fish with a noun in 6c. Third person objects are introduced with nouns in clause l Ob 'I didn't
see anyone' and 1 1 b 'I chewed some betel nut' . The author refers to his father with a kin
58term in 1 2c, and quotes h i s father' s use o f h i s own name in 1 3b. H i s father also mentions
fish with a noun, in 1 5b.","[65, 66]"

2.1.1 DURATION
  Bickerton has drawn attention to the primacy of duration in the development of language:
         ... all the evidence suggests that punctual-nonpunctual was the first TMA
         distinction to be grammaticised, and accordingly, the form that marked the
         distinction would have been juxtaposed to the main verb. (1981: 284)    In Yele, the duration of the event is the most important dichotomy affecting the predicate.
It is an all-pervasive dichotomy, affecting the verb root that is selected in a particular
16instance, and also the prenuclear and postnuclear components of the predicate used in that
instance. The dichotomy is similar to Comrie's perfective-imperfective dichotomy:
        ... perfectivity indicates the view of a situation as a single whole, without
        distinction of the various separate phases that make up that situation; while the
        imperfective pays essential attention to the internal structure of the situation.
        (1976: 1 6)  It seems better in Yele, however, to retain the terms 'punctiliar' and 'continuous', to avoid
any suggestion that Yele has a Perfect tense. Furthermore, Yele maintains the continuous­
punctiliar distinction in the habitual mood as well as the indicative, but Comrie's scheme
appears to regard habituals as necessarily imperfective (1976: 25, Table 1).
     Examples ( 6) and (7) illustrate the effects of duration on Yele predications.

                 They were working hard (today).                 (continuous intransitive)
   Most Yele verbs have both continuous and punctiliar roots, such as the verb 'break' in
example (6), where p wapl is the continuous root, and pwaa is a punctiliar root. Example (6a)
describes a momentary action, while example ( 6b) describes an activity with focus on its
duration. Kpee in (7a) is a punctiliar root, describing the complete action of washing. Its
continuous equivalent is kuku.

   Since most verbs have both punctiliar and continuous roots, the speaker can choose to
represent each event in a continuous or punctiliar form, as illustrated by the next two
examples.
     (9)    a.   D:a                            peedJ,

                 but I didn't kill it (lit. didn't take its life).
                                                                                              17   Despite all the hitting with the bushknife (ni vyee in (9», the shark resisted the
fisherman's attempts to kill it. In contrast, quick death came with a single blow in vya 'hit' in
example (10):
   (10) a.     [Ke kn:aa ngeh m,
               pole butt   I      hit. REM
          b.   [mbwameJ A a        chapwo,
               neck            CLS cut.REM
          c.   [mbodoJ A a       ngeedi.
               head        CLS took.REM
               He hit (his nephew) with the butt of the pole,
               cut his neck,
               and took up his head.
   The continuous root of a verb is also used as a nominal item, to name the event. When
used this way, the object affected by the event can be made explicit, but the Agent of the
action cannot be specified. Examples (11) and (12) below illustrate the verb 'hit', whose
punctiliar root is vy:a and whose continuous root is vyee. In example (12), vyee is used as a
nominal item. (Examples (11) and (12) can be seen in their wider context in text (a) in §2. 4,
where they are sentences 9 and l Oa respectively.)
   (11)        [ U kuwo dini ghi      ngeJ T w-a-nyi             vy:a.
               its after time piece Time D-FUT- 2SG.SB hit
               After that you ram it (the copra).
   (12)        [ U vyee    tedel L [lan:il1A w-a -nyi           ghodo, ...
               its hitting place coconut D-FUT- 2SG.SB gather
               You carry the copra to its ramming place...
   In example (12), the object of vyee is expressed pronominally, so the third person
singular possessive form is used. A noun as object is illustrated in example (13):
   (13)        [Mbweme pipi       tedelL n:aa                    Jepi.
               pig        eating place CI. IM.FUT. l SG.SB going
               I'm going to the pig feast.
   Although most Yele verbs have both punctiliar and continuous roots, a small set of
continuous intransitive verb roots have no punctiliar counterparts. The root dpodo 'working'
in example (7b) is one such root. Some others are:
  kmaapi       dining
  mbe          crying
  ng:aa        listening
   When the speaker wishes to portray such a continuous event with a punctiliar aspect,
referring to the event in its entirety, he can punctiliarise it with mb:ane 'do punctually'.
   (14)        [A               kaJs de                 ng:aa      mb:ane.

               He obeyed me (lit. listened to me).
  To portray the inception of a continuous event, the continuous verb root is used with the
appropriate form of pwapi 'breaking'.
18     (15)        [Mbe]A a       puwa.
                 crying CLS broke.REM
                 He started (lit. broke out) crying (before yesterday).
   There is a small set of verbs of motion in which the punctiliar root is used to portray an
event actually taking place at the moment of speech, or an event soon to take place. The fact
that a punctiliar root is used in the domain of the continuous is marked by an anomalous set
of predicate postnucIei:
     singular subject:      kni         (normally used with PL PRX.DU.SB)
     dual subject:          knopwo      (normally used with PLREM.DU.SB)
     plural subject:        dniye       (normally used with PLREM.PL.SB)
  The punctiliar roots most commonly used in a continuous way are kee 'come/go up/in'
whose normal continuous equivalent is koko 'coming/going up/in', 166 'cross over' (normal
continuous equivalent 166160) and pwiye 'come', for which I have never heard a continuous
equivalent. The following examples illustrate the fact that kee, 166 and pwiye are essentially
punctiliar roots:
     (16) a.     [NkeiJ] A [mw:aandiyeh da                           kee.

2.3.2 SUBORDINATION  The categories of subordination distinguished in Yele are Time, Logical relationships and

     The predicate nucleus consists of the verb root and sometimes an incorporated noun.
( 1 ) Noun incorporation
   Noun incorporation is a flexible and ongoing process in Yele, and is used to refer to an
action affecting a generic noun in the role of Patient or Goal. The noun incorporated must be
non- specific, and the resulting predicate is intransitive and continuous. As Mithun
(1984: 849) has pointed out, the noun cannot co-occur with deictics or numerals. Noun
incorporation in Yele matches her type 1.1 classification, composition by juxtaposition:
       ... a V and its direct object are simply juxtaposed to form an especially tight
       bond. The V and N remain separate words phonologically; but as in all
       compounding, the N loses its syntactic status as an argument of the sentence,
       and the VN unit functions as an intransitive predicate.",[34]
"   Is it purely coincidence that the predicate postnucleus used with a third person singular
object with polyfocal subject (such as in example (74» is ngme? It is hardly a coincidence
that the numeral 'one' used in counting is also ngme.
     ngme               1
     miy6               2
     pyile              3
     paadi              4 and so on.
     (The numeral 'one' used in quantifying a noun phrase is a related form, ngmidi.)

   Example (75) also illustrates the preference Rossel people have for understatements.
Literally it means 'Not one group of people is standing there.'",[50]
"
2.2.3 POSTPOSITIONAL PHRASES
   Postpositional phrases are used to specify a locational concept in detail . Some such
phrases have extended meanings to express temporal setting or relative time. (See examples
(238) and (239) below .) Some postpositions require a dependent pronoun between the noun
and the postposition (233), while others do not (234).",[82]
"
2.1.3 TENSE
   In the indicative mood, six tenses are distinguished for continuous events, but only four
for punctiliar events. Punctiliar verb roots cannot be manifested in the immediate future and
present tenses.
   This section outlines the ways in which the tenses are distinguished. Sections 2. 1. 4 to
2.1. 6 give further details.
                                                                                                21(1) Future tense   In the indicative mood, future prenuclear components are prefixed with a - 'future' and
optionally with w- 'definite situation'. (See §2. 1.7.S also.)
   (22) a.     W-a -dnyi                  mbwollmbwoli.
               D -FUT-CI.DST. 3PL.SB hiding
               They (plural) will be hiding (tomorrow).                            (continuous)
          b.   W-a     mbwoll dmi.
               D-FUT hide       IT. PI.PRX. PL.SB
               They (plural) will hide (tomorrow).                                  (punctiliar)
   The future tense with continuous events covers the period tomorrow and later, but with
punctiliar events, it covers any time after the present moment. It is also used with a second
person singular subject to express a general procedure that people follow.
   (23)        [DYUU]A a -nyi-ne                   pyidu  t6.
               heap       FUT- PI. 2SG.SB- CLS stand. up T.IND. PRX. 3PL. O.MF
               One gathers them (coconuts) into heaps.                (text (b), clause 2c)
               (lit. You (singular) will stand up heaps.)
(2) Immediate future versus present tense
   Immediate future and present forms with third person subjects usually can not be
distinguished:
  (24)         A                         mbwollmbwoll t6.
               CI.PRES/IM.FUT.3.SB hiding             IT. CI. PRX. PL.SB
               They are/will soon be hiding.                                       (continuous)
   Some people, however, mark continuous indicative present tense intransitive verbs with
third person singular subjects by changing the postnucleus from the usual 0 to ne ( 2Sa).
Similarly, equative statements are sometimes marked with ne (2Sb).
  ( 2S) a.     [Daa yoo      ngmiffil A [y:llL a                kwo
               NEG group one           there CI. PRES. 3.SB standing
               ne.
               IT. CI. PRES. 3SG. SB
               There are many groups of people there.
               (A characteristic Yele understatement - lit. Not one group is standing there.)          b.   [Gregory hop [ala ne] cOM .
               Gregory        here PRES
               Gregory is here.
Punctiliar events do not occur with present or immediate future tense, as stated above.
   With first and second person subjects, present and immediate future forms can be
distinguished:
   (26) a.     N:aa                   mbwollmbwoll.
               CI. IM.FUT. l SG.SB hiding
               I'll be hiding soon.                                          (immediate future)
22              b.   A-ni                 mbwolimbwoli.
                   CLPRES- l SG.SB hiding
                   I'm hiding (at this moment).                                          (present)
   Present tense forms are rare. The immediate future is frequently used for events that are
actually happening as well as for events that will happen soon.
(3) Immediate past and near past tenses
   The prenuclear components of immediate past and near past predicates are in a reciprocal
relationship with duration. The immediate past continuous prenuclei (27) are identical with
the near past punctiliar prenuclei (28). The immediate past punctiliar prenuclei have a stop
feature added to them (de in (29)), and the near past continuous prenuclei used with third
person subjects also contain a stop feature (dnyi in (30)):

                   They hid (earlier today).                           (punctiliar immediate past)
     (30)          Dnyi                  mbwolimbwoli.
                   CLNR. PST.3PL.SB hiding
                   They were hiding (yesterday).                           (continuous near past)
   Near past tense is used for events that happened yesterday. Immediate past is used for
events that happened 'earlier today', but also for punctiliar events that took place earlier than
today, even into the far past, if the present effects of the events are in focus (Comrie' s
'perfect'). I n example (31) below, the fire was into the domain of the remote past by the time
the news travelled right around Rossel, but the news is conveyed in the immediate past to
show that its effects remain.
     (31) a.       [Pi    yint6mu Y:OO] E ny:ee ng6pu,
                   person all       PL.E   hear   T.PL REM. 3SG.O.PF

                   they.said shell.money fire SG.E PI.IM.PST. SG. SB eat
                   Everyone heard that at N:aa and Teepwe's village fire had destroyed the shell
                   money.
(4) Discourse function of immediate past tense
   In a narrative set in the remote past, the immediate past is used for several punctiliar
clauses at the climax of the narrative, if the emotive content of the story warrants it. (Many
stories are told without any shift to the immediate past.) For example, in Gregory Mepe""s
narrative of his trip to Port Moresby and years of work there, he switches to the immediate
past at the point where he is met at the wharf and taken to the place where he is to live and
                                                                                              23work. In Kadawa's story of a trip to T:am for a bride-price ceremony, she switches to the
immediate past for the distribution of the shell wealth, then back to the remote past again.
This switch seems to mark the focus of the story. It is signalled by using a continuous future
prenucleus with a punctiliar verb root and postnucleus.
   (32)            [ Teetee mbwemi   kni  Y:OO] E ­

  Longacre (1972: 135f) reports a similar tense shift marking the climaxes of legends in Fore
and Waffa, Highland languages of Papua New Guinea.
(5) Remote past tense
   The one tense remaining to be described here is the remote past - events that took place
before yesterday.
   (33) a.         Dnye              mbwolimbwoli.
                   CLREM. 3PL.SB hiding
                   They were hiding (before yesterday).               (continuous remote past)

(4) Incorporating the deictic mu
  Another deictic which is incorporated in the predicate prenucleus is mu 'other' . The verbal
equivalent is mu- or mJ-, and it means ' in the other place' .

(5) Incorporating the deictic yi
   The remaining deictic which is incorporated into the predicate prenucleus is yi 'previously
discussed' . When incorporated into the predicate, it accentuates reference to a previously
introduced discourse participant, sometimes approximating the force of the English cleft
sentence 'He's the one that...'

prenucleus, producing a new portmanteau morpheme. Some of these are illustrated in Table
2. l .7.5.2.","[62, 63]"
"(4) Reason
   Reason can be expressed at clause level with u (l:ee) dly:o 'on account of' . A dependent
pronoun is obligatory, but the morpheme 1:ee is optional . Its use seems to be a matter of
idiosyncratic style.

(5) Accompaniment
   The viewpoint is different from English in that Yele uses the accompaniment slot to
specify more explicitly the subject of a clause, and the verb agrees in number and person
with the combined party, from the speaker' s point of view.

   Non-verbal predication in past or future can not be distinguished from that in the present,

   A second strategy is followed in Yele for marking motion towards the reference point, and
that is to add <-ne> 'close' to the 'basic' form rather than adding a. « -ne> is manifested by
-de following dPl, by -ne elsewhere.) This strategy is used with the following categories of
tense, mood, aspect and Subject identity:
      A continuous immediate future and continuous proximal habitual forms with non­
        third person subject ( 1 1 1 ). (With third person forms the prenucleus is wune ( 1 1 2) . )

      B: continuous immediate past indicative and punctiliar indicative forms in which the
         last syllable of the unmarked prenucleus contains a palatalised nasal, either a nasal
         continuant ( 1 1 3 ) or nasal release ( 1 1 4).

(8) Interaction between duration and transitivity
   While transitive verbs are generally distinct from intransitive verbs, and both can be either
continuous or punctiliar, there is a small set of verbs in which there is an interaction between
transitivity and duration. The verb 'writelcarve' is a suitable example of the verbs in this set.
The transitive verb d:ee 'write something' is completely regular, using the root d:ee for all
punctiliar predications (58 a), and the reduplicated form d:eed:ee for all continuous
predications (58b). The intransitive verb 'writing ' , however, is also d:ee, but in this case the
root is continuous (58c). As is to be expected, the intransitive form shows focus on the
event, with no way of specifying the object being carved or written. There is no punctiliar
intransitive verb 'write' .

                 They were writing (before yesterday).                     (continuous intransitive)(9) Existential verb root selection
   As mentioned above, there are two existential verbs which have suppletive roots. They
have the meanings 'be sitting' and 'be standing' . The third existential verb, 'be hanging' , has
only one root, t:a. Existential predications in Yele must use one of these three verbs, which
must agree with the class of the participant acting as subject of the predication (i.e. the entity
whose existence is asserted) . The classes are predominantly semantic: trees and mountains
stand, people and shell coins sit while boats and roads hang. Of course the newcomer to
Rossel Island finds some seeming anomalies, such as
     (59)        [Ngwolo deJA daa                         kwo       mo.

"2.3. 1 CO-ORDINATION
   Time-sequenced discourses such as narrative and procedural are rich in co-ordinated
sentences, where the semantic relationship is ADDITION. The clauses are juxtaposed, with
no overt linkage.

2. 1 .7.2 COMMONALITY
   Where a predication parallels a previous predication in some way, the morpheme mye
'also' is merged with the predicate prenucleus. In example (76), the Agent and the event are
the same in both clauses, but the Patient differs.
     (76)    a.   [A mailbaglA [k:umul M noD                tpye.
                  my mailbag   in.the.hand CI.REM . l SG.SB holding

                 I was holding my mailbag in (one) hand, and the saw blade in the other.
   This morpheme can also be used with the force of English 'still', as in example (77).
   (77) a.       [ U chine] A ghay wo,                   [nt:ee,k
                 his nephew fall       IT. PI. REM. 3.SB lagoon

                 also-NEG-other saw
                 His nephew dived into the lagoon, but didn't see the clam...
                 he dived again, but still didn't see it...
    Examples (76) and (77) illustrate uses of mye- where it is prefixed to the predicate
prenucleus without change. In a number of combinations of TMA and Subject Person,
however, mye- is merged into the prenucleus to produce a new portmanteau morpheme, as
illustrated in Table 2. 1.7.2. 1.","[50, 51]"
"   The texts in §2.4 have been chosen to illustrate as many of these relationships as possible,
so frequently reference will be made to examples in the texts, rather than including the
examples in this section.
( l ) CONTRAST
   ""The relation of CONTRAST occurs between two communication units when there are at
least two points of difference between them and one point of similarity. One of the points of
difference involves an opposition"" (Beekman et. al. : p. 1 00). A simple example of contrast
where the clauses are juxtaposed without indicating the semantic relationship is:   (247) a.    [Daa] NEG [a w:aa. JcOM
               not         my dog         b.    [Nkal u       w:aa. JcOM                                    CONTRAST to (a)
               Nkal his dog
               It' s not my dog.
               It' s Nkal' s dog.
  The two points of difference are: (a) not my, and (b) 0 Nkal' s. The point of similarity is
w:aa 'dog ' . These two clauses are sentences 3 and 4 of text (d) in §2.4.
   A similar example of CONTRAST is between the two clauses of sentence 5 in text (c) in
§2.4, where the Topic is constant in both clauses, and the two differences are in the Time
and Comment positions.
80  A possible example of the CONTRAST relationship, where the contrast is with an implied
expectation, is:     (248) a.     [A p:aa        peek di                          Je,
                  my village part     PLIM.PST. 1 S G . S B go            b.    [pllA d:oo                         m6du.
                  person PLIM . PST. 1 SG . S B .NEG see.REM
                  I went home,
                  but I didn't see anyone.
   This sentence, however, may only illustrate the ADDITION relationship, with the second
clause simply giving the next event in the narrative.
    The CONTRAST relationship can be made explicit with the conjunction ngmene 'but' as
in the following examples.     (249) a.     [Kpemi k:ii              ntee te-ni,J cOM
                  shark     appearance like fish-SPEC

                  but you can't eat it.

                  but there' s just one thing,
                  I ' ve forgotten Chima's youngest nephew ' s name.
(2) REASON-RESULT    The REASON clause usually precedes the RESULT clause, often without being marked
in the surface structure. For example:
     (25 1 ) a.   [Dnyintel M a          w:ee           ngopu,
                  badly          CLS understand T.PI.REM. 3 S G . O . PF
             b.   [pyaa     YOO] A mbepe WOo                                        RESULT of (a)

                  They didn't understand,
                  so the women ran away.
   Similar examples are at text (a), sentences 1 - 5 and text (d), sentences 1 0- 1 2, where the
final sentence is the result of the preceding sentences listed in each case.
                                                                                                 81   The relationship can be made explicit with u l:ee diy:o 'on account of i n the REASON
clause as in text (c), sentence 2, but this seems an unusual construction.","[87, 88, 89]"

straightforward, such as p for the bilabial stop and k for the velar stop. Others required some
care. For example, t was chosen to represent the dental phoneme and d to represent the post­
alveolar phoneme, because some Rossel people were already writing these sounds this way,
and because the post-alveolar stop is partially voiced word medially adjacent to a short vowel
and so it is similar to d in English. The digraph th was rejected by the Rossel people as a
representation for one of these phonemes, because the nearby Sudest language has [0] in its
inventory, and the Rossels did not want there to be any confusion with that sound. The
dental and post-alveolar nasals posed a problem, as the English alphabet does not provide
any equivalent in the nasals to t and d, so the acute accent used to mark close vowels was
borrowed and pressed into service to mark the dental nasal. The velar nasal is represented by
ng to match English usage. The velar fricative is represented on Goodenough Island by g,
but gh was chosen for the Yele orthography to avoid confusion with the symbols used for a
prenasalised velar stop uttered with simultaneous bilabial closure (mg).
  The non-dental stops are partially voiced word medially when adjacent to a short vowel.
For the post-alveolar stop, this results in a manifestation as [r] in that environment.

  There is a contrastive series of prenasalised stops, in which the speech power of the
prenasalisation is much greater than that of the stop. Hence they are referred to as the

contrasts are illustrated in Table 1.2.2.","[14, 15]"

                       -
(The numbers match the vernacular sentences.)
1 . I went fishing today, in my small canoe. 2. Wow ! 3. The wind was very strong, 4. and
my canoe is only small, not big enough for a wind like that! 5. So I headed back home.","[97, 98, 99, 100]"

                  your dog
   For third person possessors, the identity of the possessor can be made explicit if it is not
provided adequately by the context.

(2) Specifier
  The Head noun of the phrase can be specified by a deictic, a question word or a
comparative expression. When this happens, many nouns take on a ' specified' form, others
remain unchanged, as in example (2 1 9).
     (2 1 9) a .    k6pu
                    word
                    word

                    that word
                    that word
   Some of the nouns which show this specification do so by having -ni suffixed to them, as
                                                    ,
in example (220), while others change to a specified form, as in examples (22 1 ) and (222).
                                                          •
     (220) a.       pi

                    Dad like person-SPEC
                    a person like my father
     When -ni is suffixed, some nouns change their form somewhat.
     (22 1 ) a.     nte           -->    16       nti-ni ?
                    food                 which food-SPEC
                    which food?               b.   te            -- >   16       te-ni?
                    fish                 which fish-SPEC
                    which fish?
               c.   p:ee          - ->   yi p:ee-ni
                    talk                 that talk-SPEC
                    that message
   Many nouns change their basic form when specified, without showing much resemblance
to -ni.
     (222) a.       1:ee.ghi      - ->   16-nte         1:emi.ghi?

(3) Modifier   The adjective modifying a noun follows the noun.   (223)          nee       pfifi        ndfi
                  canoe body big
                  the big canoe hull   With kin terms, a type of modification involves association with a relative, referred to by
an associated kin term.
   (224)          a     kpfim ghee
                  my wife ASS.child
                  my wife and child

   (226)          Mge6di cha
                  Mgeedi ASS.wife
                  Mgeedi and his wife
   Where the Head can be inferred from the context, the accompanying kin term can stand
alone.
   ( 227)         [Cha]A            [noko] M dpi-mo                              yey.
                  ASS.wife together C.HAB.DST.3DU.SB-DST. HAB arguing
                  The man and his wife were arguing.
(4) Quantifier
   The Head of a noun phrase can be quantified either by a number marker or by a numeric
expression. The Quantifier follows the noun. Two number markers are used, de for dual
items and yoo for plural animate items.
   ( 22 8)        [U kpfim de              Y:OO] E [u   ngomO] A kpemi ng6pu.
                  his wife DU PL.E his house                    open   T.PLREM . 3 S G . O. PF
                  His two wives opened his house.

                  woman PL     run    IT.PI.REM . S G . S B
                  The women ran away.
74   Note in example (229) that the quantifier yoo on the Absolutive item, the women, forces
singular agreement in the verb.","[79, 80, 81, 82]"

2. 1.7.3 REPETITION
   This section deals with the morpheme me-, which can be glossed 'again'. The basic
meaning is that the predication marked with me results in a previous state of affairs being
reestablished, either in reality or conceptually. Thus in (77c) in the previous section, the
nephew dived again into the lagoon looking for the clam. (Note that me- 'again' is used,
even though the diving is first narrated as 'he fell into the lagoon' in clause (a) and later as
'he dived again' in clause (c).)
  The morpheme me- is also used to indicate a return to a previous state, even though the
event is not a repetition of a previous event.

    The author had caught only one leopard shark in his life, and threw it back only once, but
it was returning to its previous location in the sea, so he used me- in the predicate.
   The morpheme me- also has an extended meaning akin to 'after all' or 'contrary to
intention', as illustrated in example (79).

   The third strategy for signalling motion is used where the unmarked predicate prenucleus
person marking is zero. Here <-mJ> is used to indicate motion in the following TMA
categories:
     I:   The basic form, -mi, is used with the third person forms of punctiliar indicative non
          immediate past and continuous indicative immediate past events. (Compare (89a)
          and (89b) with (8Sb).)
     J : The form -nyi is used with punctiliar imperatives intended for immediate execution.

(2) The continuous predicate prenucleus
   Table 2. 1 .5 . 3 presents the prenuclear forms used with continuous events. The 'basic'
punctiliar forms (near past indicatives) are used with immediate past continuous events. Near
past indicative continuous forms are similar to these basic forms, except in the third person.
Future continuous forms can be derived from the near past continuous forms by the addition
of a - ' future ' , j ust as with punctiliar forms. Present tense continuous forms can also be
derived from the 'basic' forms by the addition of a- 'present continuous', except that the first
person dual and second person plural forms have e rather than i. Immediate future forms are
further removed from the basic forms. Proximal habitual prenuclei are the same as immediate
36future indicative forms. Distal habitual forms can be derived from the near past indicative
forms by the addition of -mo 'distal habitual' , except that the first person dual form i s
derived from the 'basic' counterpart rather than from the near past form, and the third person
singular distal habitual is copied from the third person dual form. Continuous imperative
prenuclei and remote past indicative prenuclei show less relationship to the 'basic' forms.","[43, 44]"

(3) Cases marked with nge
   The Ergative marker nge is also used to mark six other cases: Instrument, Experiencer,
Factitive, Time, Manner and Realm. Alternatively, it may be better to regard these as all
being the same case, because they are all marked with nge. In this paper, however, the five
cases are distinguished, to make the semantic roles clearer in the discussion.(a) Instrument
     The Instrument with which an event is performed is marked with nge.

     Where the Instrument is expressed by a third person singular pronominal form, the variant
ngwo is used instead of nge, showing vowel approximation with the preceding dependent
pronoun u.
