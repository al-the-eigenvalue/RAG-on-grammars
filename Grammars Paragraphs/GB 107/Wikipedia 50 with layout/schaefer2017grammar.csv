 To clarify, an alternative linear ordering of adverb types leads to ungrammaticality, as illustrated
with the aspectual extent adverb sésésé and the temporal deixis adverb òdè.(i) a. ó wéló'         ólì òtòì    á sésésé òdè.
        he PAP.sweep the ground CS neatly yesterday
        ‘He swept up the ground neatly yesterday.’
    b. *ó wéló'        ólì òtòì    á ódé           sésésé.
        he PAP.sweep the ground CS yesterday neatly
        ‘He swept the ground yesterday neatly.’
7 Noncanonical constructions
Noncanonical constructions in Emai express the information status of a clause or
clause constituent in discourse. Discourse-defined constructions include positive
focus (PF) and negative focus (NF), topicalization, antitopic or right dislocation,
information questions, sentence affirmation (SA) and sentence negation (SN). Each
construction is morphosyntactically marked except topicalization, where intonation
downturn follows the topic constituent. Except for sentence affirmation and sen-
tence negation, each construction is characterized by an additional constituent that
precedes or follows its matrix clause. The resulting discourse position, typically a
noun phrase, corresponds to a matrix clause grammatical relation. Each construc-
tion also co-occurs with at least one other construction type, although distinct con-
structions never affect the same matrix clause constituent.(1) a. ólí óvbékhán nà lí ó gbé'                 ólí ákhè á.
       the youth        this PF he PAP.break the pot CS
       ‘It was this youth who broke the pot.’
    b. ólí óvbékhán nà kí ó gbé'                 ólí ákhè á.
       the youth        this NF he PAP.break the pot CS
       ‘It wasn't this youth who broke the pot.’
    c. ólí óvbékhán nà, ò gbé                ólí ákhè á.
       the youth        this he PRP.break the pot CS
       ‘As for this youth, he broke the pot.’
    d. ó gbé'           ólí ákhè á, í khì ólí óvbékhán nà.
       he PAP.break the pot CS ID be the youth               this
       ‘He broke the pot, that is this youth.’
    e. óé' ó gbé'             ólí ákhè á?
       who he PAP.break the pot CS
       ‘Who broke the pot?’
    f. érí' ólí óvbékhán gbé'           ólí ákhè á.
       SA the youth         PAP.break the pot CS
       ‘Indeed, the youth broke the pot.’
    g. kí ólí óvbékhán gbé'              ólí ákhè á ò.
       SN the youth          PAP.break the pot CS INT
       ‘It isn't the case that the youth broke the pot (contrary to your opinion).’7.1 Noun phrase focus
Focus constructions assume a contrast between speaker and hearer knowledge
regarding the information status of a nominal referent or predicate event. Construc-
348 | Noncanonical constructionstion purpose is to align hearer and speaker knowledge. Focus position in this con-
struction expresses information that is not shared by speaker and hearer. Its follow-
ing matrix clause conveys shared information.
     Focus position is marked in affirmative structures by the morpheme li/ni and in
negative structures by ki. Focus position immediately precedes a matrix clause and
its constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause. For ex-
ample, the focus position constituent ólí émà followed by li/ni or ki corresponds to
the direct object relation following the matrix verb shen. Focus position noun
phrases manifest an unmarked tone pattern, i.e. they accept a right edge low tone.
On the other hand, focus construction matrix clauses inflect for a limited range of
aspects, all with a right edge high tone subject.(2) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ló        shèn ákhò.
       the yam PF the man PRED sell tomorrow
       ‘It was the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
    b. ólí émà kí ólí ómóhé ló        shèn ákhò.
       the yam NF the man PRED sell tomorrow
       ‘It wasn't the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’Across affirmative and negative focus types, only positive focus allows omission of
the construction marker. When li/ni is omitted, vowel elision does not affect phono-
logical shape of either focus noun phrase (ólí émà) or matrix clause initial constitu-
ent (ólí ómóhé).(3) ólí émà ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
    the yam the man PAP.sell-F
    ‘It was the yam that the man sold.’7.1.1 Matrix clause marking of focus relationFocus constructions show variable grammatical marking of the matrix clause posi-
tion corresponding to a focus constituent. They also limit nominal structure types in
focus position. As well, they constrain marking of their matrix clause as to inflec-
tion, auxiliaries and preverbs.
     Focus constructions mark the matrix grammatical relation corresponding to a
focus constitutent with one of three strategies. The first of these affects matrix sub-
ject, possessor or first object in a double object complement. Each shows a pronoun
corresponding to the focus position constituent. A positive or negative focus posi-
tion noun phrase (ólí ómòhè) corresponds to a third person singular pronoun (o ‘he’)
in matrix subject position.
                                                             Noun phrase focus | 349(4) ólí ómòhè lí / kí ó shén'      ólí úkpùn lí     ólì òkpòsò.
    the man PF NF he PAP.sell the cloth APP the woman
    ‘It was / wasn’t the man who sold the cloth to the woman.’Number agreement across focus and corresponding matrix clause position is re-
quired. A plural noun phrase (élí ímòhè) in focus position corresponds to third per-
son plural nominative pronoun, either e or yan depending on matrix clause aspect
(Chapter 5, 5.4).(5) a. élí ímòhè lí / kí é        gbé'       ólí ófè.
       the men PF NF they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘It was / wasn’t the men who killed the rat.’
    b. élí ímòhè lí / kí yán à gbè ófé yè             òjè.
       the men PF NF they H kill rat move.to Oje
       ‘It is / isn't the men who kill rats for Oje.’Focus position noun phrases corresponding to possessor in Associative ísì phrases
(ólì ònwìmè) require a genitive pronoun (òí) in matrix clause possessor position.(6) ólì ònwìmè lí / kí éghó' ísì òí úé'-ì.
    the farmer PF NF money ASS his PAP.be.lost-F
    ‘It was / wasn't the farmer whose money was lost.’A pronoun in matrix possessor position occurs regardless of whether the possessor
(àlèkè) precedes (external possessor, accusative case óí) or follows (internal posses-
sor, genitive case òí) the possessum.(7) a. àlèkè lí / kí ójé dó'                  óí éghó' nwú.
       Aleke PF NF Oje PAP.do.in.stealth her money take
      ‘It was / wasn't from Aleke that Oje stole the money.’
    b. àlèkè lí / kí ójé dó'                éghó' ísì òí nwú.
       Aleke PF NF Oje PAP.do.in.stealth money ASS her take
       ‘It was / wasn't from Aleke that Oje stole the money.’Pronoun marking also affects first object (ólí óvbékhán) in a double object comple-
ment. When first object position corresponds to a focus position constituent, it
shows an accusative pronoun (óí).(8) ólí óvbèkhàn lí / kí ólí ókpósó fí'      óí úkpóràn.
    the youth      PF NF the woman PAP.hit him stick
    ‘It was / wasn't the youth whom the woman hit with a stick.’
350 | Noncanonical constructions    A second marking strategy requires addition of a verb or preverb to the matrix
clause. This affects locative and manner-demonstrative adjuncts, grammatical rela-
tions not subcategorized by a verb. When a focus position noun phrase (èkìn) corre-
sponds to a locative adjunct marked by preposition vbi, the matrix clause shows
verb za ‘be located’ in series. Not retained in focus or matrix clause position is vbi.(9) èkìn     lí / kí ójé zá'         shén ólí úkpùn lí      ólì òkpòsò.
    market PF NF Oje PAP.be.loc sell the cloth APP the woman
    ‘It was / wasn't in the market Oje sold the cloth to the woman.’When a focus position constituent corresponds to a manner-demonstrative adjunct
(e.g. ìyó), the matrix clause shows an obligatory Manner preverb i.(10) ìyó    lí / kí ólí ómóhé í'             gbé ólí ófè.
     DMD PF NF the man PAP.MAN kill the rat
     ‘It was / wasn't that way that the man killed the rat.’     A third marking strategy affects remaining grammatical relations. When a ma-
trix monotransitive verb is morphosyntactically bare, i.e. contains no auxiliary or
preverb morpheme and no marker of imperfect or prospective aspect, direct object
position shows a zero pronoun and the verb displays Factative suffix -i.1 Adjunct
constituents like adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ do not upset this bare condition.(11) a. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
        the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell-F
        ‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man sold.’
     b. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén-í'         òdè.
        the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell-F yesterday
        ‘It was / wasn’t the cloth that the man sold yesterday.’    An additional constraint on Factative suffixation occurs under conditions of
complex predication. Factative assignment shows four exceptions, with each excep-
tion showing a zero pronoun. The exceptions have in common the addition of mor-
phological material to an otherwise simple predication. When their direct object
corresponds to a focus position constituent, split verbs do not admit Factative -i (mi
dan ‘swallow’ in ólí ómóhé mí ùkèlè dán ‘The man swallowed a morsel’).(12) ùkèlè lí / kí ólí ómóhé mí dán'.
     morsel PF NF the man PAP.swallow
     ‘It was / wasn't a morsel that the man swallowed.’
                                                            Noun phrase focus | 351Verbs within complex predicates showing postverbal particles (CS a, CL o, PA e or
APP li/ni, Chapter 9) do not accept Factitive -i when their direct object position cor-
responds to a focus constituent. Verbs like shen that take a direct object and an
indirect object (lí ólì òkpòsò) show only a zero pronoun when their direct object
position corresponds to a focus position constituent (ólí úkpùn). And verbs like gbe
that show a direct object followed by the Change of State particle a do not take Fac-
tative -i when their direct object corresponds to a focus position constituent.(13) a. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'        lí    ólì òkpòsò.
        the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell APP the woman
        ‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man sold to the woman.’
     b. ákhè lí / kí ólí ómóhé gbé'           á.
        pot PF NF the man PAP.break CS
        ‘It was / wasn't a pot that the man broke.’Neither verb in a serial verb construction accepts Factative -i when its direct object
corresponds to a focus position constituent.(14) ólí ókpósó lí / kí ólí ómóhé nwú'       ólí úkpùn yé.
     the woman PF NF the man PAP.take the cloth move.to
     ‘It was / wasn't the woman who the man took the cloth to.’Finally, verb forms that over historical time have lexicalized morphological material
(e.g. zawo < ze + ao + ghoo> [cause+face+look]) never allow Factative -i when their
direct object corresponds to a focus constituent.(15) ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé zá'wò / *zá'wó'-ì.
     the cloth PF NF the man PAP.see see-F
     ‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man saw.’     Matrix grammatical relations other than direct object also manifest the zero
pronoun strategy. When a focus constituent corresponds to matrix indirect object, a
zero pronoun occupies the matrix clause position. Under this condition, Applicative
li/ni designating indirect object in the matrix clause is consistently retained in its
postverbal position.(16) ólì òkpòsò lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'    ólí úkpùn ní.
     the woman PF NF the man PAP.sell the cloth APP
     ‘It was / wasn't the woman who the man sold the cloth to.’
352 | Noncanonical constructionsA focus constituent corresponding to a temporal adjunct also reveals a correspond-
ing matrix clause zero pronoun.(17) élélá òdè         lí / kí ólí ókpósó dé'      ògèdè.
     TP yesterday PF NF the woman PAP.buy plantain
     ‘It was / wasn't the yesterday we discussed when the woman bought plantain.’7.1.2 Focus position nominal constraintsThe noun phrase position defined by affirmative and negative focus constructions
reflects few lexical constraints. Nonetheless, it restricts lexical modification and
pronominal type. Focus position marked as affirmative or negative accepts various
nominal types ranging from proper names to count and mass nouns varying in ani-
macy. For instance, focus position accepts proper names (e.g. òlólò).(18) òlólò lí / kí ó gbé'       ólí ófè.
     Ololo PF NF he PAP.kill the rat
     ‘It was / wasn't Ololo who killed the rat.’Positive and Negative Focus positions attract unmodified human (ómòhè), nonhu-
man animate (ófè), inanimate (úkpùn) and place (èkìn) nouns, modified or not by
the definite predeterminer.2(19) a. ómòhè / ólí ómòhè lí ó gbé'            ólí ófè.
        man       the man PF he PAP.kill the rat
        ‘It was a man / the man who killed the rat.’
     b. ómòhè / ólí ómòhè kí ó gbé'             ólí ófè.
        man       the man NF he PAP.kill the rat
        ‘It wasn't a man / the man who killed the rat.’
     c. ófè / ólí ófè lí ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì.
        rat the rat PF the woman PAP.kill-F
        ‘It was a rat / the rat that the woman killed.’
     d. ófè / ólí ófè kí ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì.

        ‘It wasn't a rat / the rat that the woman killed.’
     e. úkpùn / ólí úkpùn lí ólí ómóhé shén'            lí  ólì òkpòsò.

                                                              Noun phrase focus | 353    f. úkpùn / ólí úkpùn kí ólí ómóhé shén'          lí    ólì òkpòsò.
       cloth the cloth NF the man PAP.sell APP the woman
       ‘It wasn't cloth / the cloth that the man sold to the woman.’
    g. èkìn / ólì èkìn      lí ójé zá'          dé ólí úkpùn.
       market the market PF Oje PAP.be.loc buy the cloth
       ‘It was in a market / the market that Oje bought the cloth.’
    h. èkìn / ólì èkìn       kí ójé zá'          dé ólí úkpùn.
       market the market NF Oje PAP.be.loc buy the cloth
       ‘It wasn't in a market / the market that Oje bought the cloth.’     Focus position restricts postdeterminers in each of the classes demonstrative,
kindred, numeral and quantifier. Deictic and contrastive demonstratives modify
focus position nouns. Deictic demonstratives appear in either positive or negative
focus position: proximal nà (ólí ómóhé nà lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man this PF NF he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't this man who killed the rat’) and distal áìn (ólí
ómóhé áìn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man that PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't
that man who killed the rat’). Contrastive demonstrative nóì, which never occurs
with the definite predeterminer, is found in affirmative but not negative focus con-
stituents (ómóhé nóì lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man next PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was
the next man who killed the rat’).
     Kindred modifiers, which never combine with the definite article, show limita-
tions across focus polarity types. Deictic kindred élìyó appears in both affirmative
and negative focus positions (ófé élìyó lí / kí ó ó' vbì òò [rat that.kind PF NF it
PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of rat that entered the hole’). Contras-
tive kindred ódàn is restricted to positive focus position (ófé ódàn lí / *kí ó ó' vbì òò
[rat different.kind PF NF it PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was a different kind of rat that
entered the hole’).
     Quantifier types are constrained in their distribution across affirmative and
negative focus constructions. The collective universal quantifier èrèmé, with op-
tional definite predeterminer, appears in focus position, irrespective of focus polari-
ty ((élí) ímóhé èrèmé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [the men all PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house]
‘It was / wasn't all the men that entered the house’). However, the distributive uni-
versal quantifier òdóòdé is never acceptable, regardless of focus polarity (*ímóhé
òdóòdé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [men each PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / was-
n't each of the men that entered the house’).
     Existential quantifiers, which never co-occur with the definite article, are not
distributed symmetrically across focus polarity types. Limited to positive focus con-
structions are partitive existential quantifier ósò (ómóhé ósò lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè
[man certain PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was a certain man who killed the rat’) and
contrastive existential quantifier óvbèé (ómóhé óvbèé lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man an-
354 | Noncanonical constructionsother PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was another man who killed the rat’). They fail
with negative focus ki.
     Cardinal numerals greater than ‘one’ appear in focus position, regardless of
their co-occurrence with the definite article, e.g. èvá ‘two’ ((élí) éfè èvá lí / kí é ó' vbì
òò [the rats two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't (the) two rats who
entered the hole’). Collective numerals, which do not co-occur with the definite
article, modify nouns in positive or negative focus position, e.g. èvèvá ‘both, all two
of’ (éfè èvèvá lí / kí é ó' vbì òò [rats all.two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was /
wasn't both rats that entered the hole’). With an otherwise unmodified noun, nu-
meral òkpá ‘one’ occurs in positive or negative focus position (ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [man one PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't one man who en-
tered the house’). In addition, emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone’ modifies nouns
marked as definite in positive or negative focus position (ólí ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [the man alone PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't the man
alone who entered the house’).
     Focus position noun phrases also accept nonlexical postdeterminers. Focus
noun phrases take as postnominal modifiers Associative ísì phrases (éwé ísì ólì
òkpòsò lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat ASS the woman PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was
/ wasn’t the goat of the woman that entered the house’), Relator li phrases (éwé lí
óbín' lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat R dark PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn’t
the dark goat that entered the house’) and relative clause li/ni constituents (ómóhé lí
ó dá' ólí ényò lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man R he PAP.drink the wine PF NF he PAP.kill the
rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the man who drank the wine who killed the rat’). Speaker pref-
erence is for focus constituents without definite article ólì/élì.
     Pronominal forms also occupy focus position. Irrespective of construction polar-
ity, focus position accepts personal and impersonal pronouns. However, constraints
apply that affect case as well as person and number agreement. Among personal
pronouns, only emphatic forms (e.g. ìyàìn, mèmè) appear in focus position. Emphat-
ic personal pronouns must agree in person and number with their matrix clause
anaphoric pronoun (yan or i). Across focus polarity types, emphatic pronouns in
focus position accept emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone.’(20) a. ìyàìn / mèmè lí / kí yán / í gbé'          ólí ófè.
        they I        PF NF they I PAP.kill the rat
        ‘It was / wasn’t they / I who killed the rat.’
     b. ìyàìn òkpá lí / kí yán gbé'           ólí ófè.
        they alone PF NF they PAP.kill the rat
        ‘It was / wasn't they alone who killed the rat.’   Focus position attracts impersonal pronouns from demonstrative, kindred, nu-
meral and quantifier classes with few restrictions. Each demonstrative pronoun
                                                               Noun phrase focus | 355occurs in focus position: distal deictic óáìn (óáìn lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [that.one PF NF it
PAP.kill rat] ‘It was /wasn’t that one who killed a rat’), proximal ònà (ònà lí / kí ó
gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was / wasn’t this one who killed a rat’),
emphatic proximal ónánà (ónánà lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It
was / wasn’t this very one who killed a rat’), as well as contrastive demonstrative
ónóì (ónóì lí / (*kí ) ó gbé' ófè [next.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was the next one who
killed a rat’).
     Both kindred pronouns occur in focus position: deictic élìyó (élìyó lí / kí ólí
ómóhé gbé'-ì [that.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of one
that the man killed’) and contrastive ódàn (ódàn lí / kí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [differ-
ent.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't a different kind of one that the
man killed’).3
     Focus position accepts few quantifier pronouns.4 It takes the collective univer-
sal quantifier èrèmé (èrèmé lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F]
‘It was / wasn't all that the woman killed’). Ungrammatical in focus position are the
distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé as well as both existential pronouns (ósò
and óvbèé).
     Focus position accepts numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ in their cardinal
form, e.g. èvá (èvá lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was
/ wasn’t two that the woman killed’) or collective form, e.g. èvèvá (èvèvá lí / kí ólí
ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all.two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn’t both that the
woman killed’). As head of a partitive vbi phrase, cardinal numerals also occur in
focus position, e.g. èvá (èvá vbì ò lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two LOC it PF NF the
woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't two of them that the woman killed’).5
     Numeral pronoun ‘one’ appears in focus position, as cardinal òkpá (òkpá lí / kí
ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't one that the
woman killed’) or partitive úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbì ò lí /*kí ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one LOC
it PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was one of them that the woman killed’). Howev-
er, úkpòkpá only occurs in positive focus.
     Focus position also accepts expressions framed as pronominally headed relative
clauses (ólí ó (*á) dé' ólí úkpùn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [one he RC PAP.buy the cloth PF
NF it PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the one who bought the cloth who killed the
rat’) or attribution phrases (ólí óbín' lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the dark.one PF NF it
PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the dark one who killed the rat’). Pronominally
headed relatives only occur in focus position under conditions of specific reference.
Generic reference (e.g. ‘whoever’) induced by Recurrent preverb a in the relative
clause renders them unacceptable.
356 | Noncanonical constructions7.1.3 Matrix clause propertiesFocus constructions constrain expression of mood and polarity as well as inflection,
auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding mood, focus constructions never appear as
imperatives or prohibitives. Relative to polarity, both affirmative and negative focus
constructions appear as polar questions (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.sell-F] ‘Was / Wasn’t it the yam that the man sold?’).
     In their matrix clauses, affirmative focus constructions allow perfect negation
marked by ì. Negative focus constructions disallow it (ólí émá nà òkpá lí / *kí ólí
ómóhé í ì shèn [the yam this alone PF NF the man SC NEG sell] ‘It was this yam alone
which the man did not sell’).
     Matrix clauses in focus constructions limit inflection and auxiliaries. Relative to
aspect, they inflect for Past perfect, imperfect Habitual or prospective Predictive.6
All show a subject phrase with a high tone right edge. Matrix clauses in focus con-
structions reject Present perfect, imperfect Continuous or prospective Anticipative.(21) a. ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
        the yam PF NF the man PAP.sell-F

        the yam PF NF the man PRED sell
        ‘It is / isn't this yam that the man will sell.’     Focus construction matrix clauses limit deontic and epistemic modality as well
as relative tense. Of the modality forms, deontic Hortative í is never grammatical in
focus constructions. Epistemic forms are not as restricted, even if distributionally
sensitive to focus polarity. Appearing only in negative focus is Certaintive ma (ólí
émà kí / *lí ólí ómóhé má' shèn [the yam NF PF the man PAP.CER sell] ‘It wasn't the
yam that the man surely sold’), while Dubitatives only occur in positive focus polar
interrogative constructions, e.g. bia (ólí émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé bíá' shèn? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the yam that the man actually sold?’) and vba (ólí
émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé vbá' shèn? [the yam PF NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the
yam that the man really could have sold?’).
     Some epistemic forms occur in affirmative and negative focus constructions:
Concessive rere (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ré'rè shén? [the yam PF NF the man
PAP.CONC sell] ‘Was / Wasn't it the yam that the man even sold?’) and Hypothetical
kha (ólí émá nà lí / kí ólí ómóhé khà shén [the yam this PF NF the man PAP.HYP sell]
‘It was / wasn't this yam that the man would have sold’). Concessive, though, re-
                                                             Noun phrase focus | 357quires a polar interrogative structure. Remaining epistemic forms reflecting rational
judgments, Deductive za and Resultative za, fail in focus constructions.
      Relative tense exponents appear in focus matrix clauses: Anterior ke (ólí émà lí /
kí ólí ómóhé ké' shèn [the yam PF NF the man PAP.ANT sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam
that the man sold afterward’) and Subsequent kpe (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpé' shèn
[the yam PF NF the man PAP.SUB sell] ‘It was /wasn’t the yam that the man sold
despite pending conditions’).
      Focus construction matrix clauses severely limit preverb occurrence. For pre-
verbs that occur, there is a tendency to require a nondeclarative, polar interrogative
structure in negative focus constructions.
      As a class, aspectualizers interact with focus construction mood and polarity.
Matrix clauses linked to a positive focus position allow aspectualizers Repetitive che
(ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn [the yam PF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘It was the yam
that the man sold again’), Additive gbo (émà lí ólí ómóhé gbó' è [yam PF the man
PAP.ADD eat] ‘It was yam that the man ate too’) and Durative se (émà òkpá lí ólí
ómóhé sé' shèn [yam alone PF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘It was one yam that the man
still sold’). They reject Punctual ghe, regardless of polarity or mood.
      Negative focus matrix clauses accept all phasal aspectualizers but Punctual ghe.
They do so provided the construction assumes a polar interrogative form: che (ólí
émà kí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn? [the yam NF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘Wasn't it the yam
that the man sold again?’), gbo (émà kí ólí ómóhé gbó' è? [yam NF the man PAP.ADD
eat] ‘Wasn't it yam that the man also ate?’) and se (émà òkpá kí ólí ómóhé sé' shèn?
[yam alone NF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘Wasn't it one yam that the man still sold?’).
      Boundary aspectualizers manifest three distribution patterns. Irrespective of
construction polarity or mood, one finds Conative òó (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ó ó'
shèn [the yam PF NF the man SC CON sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam that the man
went to sell’).
      Neither Ingressive ya nor Egressive mo occurs in focus matrix clauses. However,
their Past Absolute functions are available in positive focus: ya (ìmátó nà lí ólí
ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè [car this PF the man PAP.PA buy TP year] ‘It was this car that
the man used to buy in the year we discussed’) and mo (émá mè lí ólí ómóhé mó'
shèn [yam my PF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘It was my yam that the man at one time
sold’). With negative focus, Past Absolutes require a polar interrogative frame: ya
(ìmátó nà kí ólí ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè? [car this NF the man PAP.PA buy TP year]
‘Wasn't it this car that the man used to buy in the year we discussed?’) and mo (émá
mè kí ólí ómóhé mó' shèn? [yam my NF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘Wasn't it my yam that
the man at one time sold?’).
      Of the temporal preverbs (kpao ‘initially,’ bobo ‘promptly,’ tua ‘hurriedly’), only
kpao appears in focus matrix clauses (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpá'ò shén [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.earlier sell] ‘It was / wasn't the yam that the man earlier on sold’).
358 | Noncanonical constructions     From the quantity class, only nonintensifier preverbs are acceptable in focus
matrix clauses. Focus constructions reject Absolute Intensifier zemi and Nonabso-
lute Intensifier zeze. Collective gba and Emphatic Reflexive dobo nonetheless occur.
Both affirmative and negative focus accept Emphatic Reflexive dobo regardless of
mood (ólí ómòhè lí / kí ó dóbó' óì é ólí émà [the man PF NF he PAP.REFL him eat the
yam] ‘It was / wasn't the man who by himself ate the yam’).7 With Collective gba,
matrix clause is declarative under positive focus (ólí émà lí élí ímóhé gbá' è [the yam
PF the men PAP.COL eat] ‘It was the yam that the men ate together’) but interroga-
tive under negative focus (ólí émà kí élí ímóhé gbá' è? [the yam NF the men PAP.COL
eat] ‘Wasn't it the yam that the men ate together?’).
     Matrix clause focus constructions never allow any of the remaining preverbs:
evaluative duu ‘for no reason,’ woo ‘instead,’ and kuku ‘after all;’ subject attributive
dábo ‘deliberately,’ dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’ gbúdu ‘coura-
geously,’ dégbè ‘carefully,’ totóbo intensely’ and kakégbe ‘perseveringly;’ or man-
ner-demonstrative DMD ìyó and PMD ìná.
     Additionally, focus constructions are limited by S-complement type and clause
subordination. Positive focus constructions occur under indicative and conditional
complements, marked by khi and si respectively. But they never appear under sub-
junctives signaled by li (*òjè ò ó hòò lí ólì òkpòsò lí ó shén' ólí émà [Oje SC C want

        ‘Oje is asking whether it was the woman who sold the yam.’Negative focus constructions are limited to indicative khi complements. They are not

[Oje SC C ask COND the woman NF she PAP.sell the yam] ‘Oje is asking whether it

"Cultural and Linguistic BackgroundEmai is mother tongue for approximately 25,000–35,000 members of the Emai clan
in south central Nigeria. It is spoken in ten villages across roughly 250 square kilo-
meters on the plateau between the Edion and Owan rivers of present-day Edo State.
Located at longitude 6° east of Greenwich Meridian and latitude 7° north of the
equator, this area consists primarily of tree savanna, allowing for bush agriculture
involving the harvesting of yam, maize, cassava, and beans among other crops
(Bradbury 1957). Serving as the principal political village of the Emai is Afuze. Other
villages in the clan are Eteye, Evbiame-New-Site, Evbiame-Old-Site, Ogute, Ojavun-
New-Site, Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhunmi, Ovbionwu, and Uanhumi.
     The Emai-speaking region is approximately 120 kilometers north of Benin City
by road. It is connected in the south to Sabongida, the principal village of the relat-
ed Ora clan, in the east to Uzebba, the primary village of the related Iuleha clan, and
in the north to Auchi, the headquarters of the Edoid language Yekhee.
     As for the Emai people, oral tradition makes clear the absence of hereditary
chieftancy, a cultural feature frequent among Edoid peoples of its region. According
to oral tradition (Ogbomo 1994), the ancestor of the Emai people is Ima. He is said to
have fled from the ancient kingdom of Benin in about the 16th Century for commit-
ting murder. Ima and his wife, who also came from Benin, had a son Uzuanbi (Oyai-
bi). Uzuanbi, in turn, had two wives, Odidi and Oron, whose sons founded the Emai
speaking villages. Oral tradition varies at this point. According to one version, the
four sons of Uzuanbi and his wives were Uwuno, Urule, Ivbiame, and Uanhumi,
each of whom founded a village. Their sons, Uzuanbi's grandsons, founded the ten
quarters into which the four villages became divided. According to another version,
the village of Uanhumi is named after the son of one wife and the remaining villages
are related to three sons of a second wife. The sons were Uule, Evbiame and
Ovbionwu, whose names are retained, respectively, by the village sites of Ugbuule,
Evbiame-Old-Site, and Ovbionwu, all of which are located off the main Ora-Auchi
road and tend to be northernmost in their respective village groups. Each of these
villages serves to link the remaining Emai-speaking area. Villages in the Uule group,
from south to north, are: Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhumi, Eteye, Uanhumi, Afuze,
Ojavun-New-Site. Ugbuule no longer exists as an occupied village. The Evbiame
group from south to north consists of Evbiame-New-Site, Ogute, and Evbiame-Old-
Site. The Ovbionwu group consists solely of Ovbionwu.
     As a linguistic entity, Emai is completely surrounded by Edoid speech varieties.
Its genetic classification as a distinct linguistic unit within Edoid is of recent origin.
Elugbe (1973) classified it as part of a dialect cluster incorporating adjacent Ora
                                                                          Preface | ix(30,000 speakers) and Iuleha (45,000 speakers); Elugbe (1989) locates this cluster
more specifically within the North Central Branch of Edoid. While a word list sup-
porting a cluster relationship among these dialects was not published, broader clas-
sificatory schemes have accepted the cluster interpretation, e.g. Hansford, Bendor-
Samuel and Stanford (1976), Bendor-Samuel (1989) and Crozier and Blench (1992).
Even Christian missionary activity in the area has never generated word lists, since
neither the Bible nor a church hymnal is available in Emai.
     Linguistic investigation of individual languages within the Edoid group is ex-
tremely limited. Other than Emai, no descriptive grammatical treatment, encom-
passing reference grammar, lexicon, and texts, has appeared for a single member of
the 25 or more Edoid languages. Perhaps the most widely recognized comparative
and historical analysis of the Edoid group is Elugbe's (1973) unpublished disserta-
tion “A Comparative Edo Phonology” and its successor, Comparative Edoid: Phonol-
ogy and Lexicon (Elugbe 1989). Also showing an exclusive interest in phonological
matters is Elimelech's (1979) A Tonal Grammar of Etsako, which examines the role of
pitch differences in words and short phrases among dialects of Yekhee spoken
northeast of Emai country.
     Among other Edoid studies, Thomas (1910) presents a highly schematic gram-
matical and lexical analysis of Bini, the numerically and culturally dominant lan-
guage of the group since establishment of the influential Edo Kingdom in the 13th
Century (Ryder 1969). Later studies of Bini amplify portions of this initial analysis.
Melzian (1937) is a descriptive dictionary from which one can infer grammatical
information at the level of parts of speech, while Amayo (1976) and Wescott (1962)
offer accounts of Bini phonology and morphology. Several linguistic studies of Bini
in pedagogical or descriptive formats have followed. Dunn's (1968) An Introduction
to Bini is a training manual prepared for the American Peace Corps and as such
couches most of its language material in a limited variety of dialogue formats for the
prospective volunteer. An additional pedagogically oriented study is An Edo-English
Dictionary by Agheyisi (1986), which is intended for use in primary and secondary
schools. Stewart (1998) provides a theoretical interpretation of selected serial verb
constructions in Bini.
     Additional linguistic studies of Edoid speech varieties tend to be descriptive.
Ejele (1986) provides an overview of selected syntactic issues in Esan. Kari (1997)
provides a brief grammatical sketch of the Delta Edoid language Degema, which is
followed by a more detailed and illustrated descriptive grammar (2004).
     As for Emai, an initial lexicon and orthographic statement is offered by Schaefer
(1987), while Egbokhare (1990) presents an initial phonological analysis. An exten-
sive collection of Emai oral tradition texts is found in Oral Tradition Narratives of the
Emai People, Parts I and II (Schaefer and Egbokhare 1999b). This is complemented
more recently by A Dictionary of Emai: An Edoid Language of Nigeria (Schaefer and
Egbokhare 2007). Additional information on Emai is available in a number of papers
x | Prefaceby Schaefer and Egbokhare published in a variety of books and journal articles. Of
particular relevance to the future of Emai as a spoken medium is Schaefer and Eg-
bokhare (1999a), which found an intergenerational shift to English as home lan-
guage in the mid-1990s without a commensurate negative evaluation of vernacular
mother tongue.

1 Orthography and grammatical overview
Emai has no written tradition except as introduced in an initial orthographic state-
ment by Schaefer (1987) and utilized in the text collection of Schaefer and Egbo-
khare (1999) and a dictionary by Schaefer and Egbokhare (2007). To maintain some
consistency in discussion of linguistic issues in Emai, we follow the practice estab-
lished by these earlier works, although some changes regarding tone marking are
noted below. In general, segment representations follow conventions for Nigerian
languages set out in Williamson (1984) and adapted for Emai.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"    ASPECT MODALITY RELATIVE-TENSE PREVERB3.1 Inflectional and auxiliary categories
Segmental morphemes that convey affirmative and negative inflection, modality
(deontic and epistemic) and relative tense are the following:Affirmative Aspect                     Negative Aspect
ò/à Habitual                           ì   Perfect Negation

za Deductive                           í   Hortative

ma Certaintive

kha Hypothetical                       kpe Subsequent
rere/ re Concessive     Inflection, specifically affirmative and negative aspect, along with subject
phrase tone is the cornerstone of Emai tonal structure within a clause. Affirmative
polarity shows perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect. No segmental forms con-
vey perfect aspect; instead, perfect aspect is signaled by subject phrase tone and
predicate phrase tone. Segmental forms that are mutually exclusive express imper-
fect and prospective aspect. Imperfect, when realized by a lexical rather than pro-
nominal subject, requires subject concord. In the expression of perfect and prospec-
tive aspect, concord is rarely exploited. Distinctions within perfect and prospective
are conveyed by a contrast in subject phrase tone. Negative polarity consists of Per-
fect, Prospective, and Past Absolute categories. When realized by a lexical rather
than pronominal subject, negation requires subject concord.
100 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs     Segmental forms in the categories of inflection, auxiliary and preverb exhibit
fixed or variable tone. Most auxiliary and preverb categories are assigned tone val-
ues by inflection. They thus show variable high, low or contour tone relative to the
fixed tone of inflectional elements conveying affirmative and negative aspect. Ex-
ceptions to this general rule are irrealis forms such as Hortative, Hypothetical and
the Conative preverb, which reveal a fixed tone. Across the categories aspect, mo-
dality, relative tense and preverb, tone value and morpheme sense interrelate. Some
segmental forms exhibit alternating tonal values (high and low) that co-vary with
alternating tonal values of the subject phrase. Each tone-form combination denotes
a distinct grammatical function. Other segmental forms show a single tone that
combines with alternating tonal values of the subject phrase. In this case, too, each
tone-form combination designates a distinct grammatical function. And still other
segmental forms manifest a single tone, combine with a single subject phrase tone,
and designate a single grammatical function.
     Two tone patterns characterize subject phrase exponents. One appears on a
pronoun that shows either a low tone (ò ‘he, she, it’) or high tone (ó ‘he, she, it’). A
second appears on a lexically specified noun phrase with a right edge low tone (òjè
‘Oje,’ ólí ómòhè ‘the man,’ ólí ómóhé nà ‘this man’) or a right edge high tone (ójé, ólí
ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná). Right edge tone on grammatical subject affects expression of
inflection as well as auxiliary, relative tense and preverbs.","[125, 126]"
"7.6.2 Negation kiSentence negation (SN) constructions are framed by clause initial ki. They negate an
entire proposition, specifying that it is not shared by speaker and hearer as true. The
construction takes the form of a polar interrogative or a declarative with an obliga-
tory contrary-to-expectation interjection ò. Consequently, ki either queries the prop-
osition expressed in the interrogative with an assumption of doubt or contravenes
the interjection framed declarative structure.(146) a. kí ólí ókpósó één'-ì?
         SN the woman PAP.know-F
         ‘Isn't it the case that the woman knew?’
      b. kí ólí ókpósó één'-ì             ò.
         SN the woman PAP.know-F INT
         ‘Don't think the woman knew, she probably didn't.’
         ‘It surely isn't the case that the woman knew.’
      c. kí ólí ómóhé méhén'-ì?
         SN the man PAP.sleep-F
         ‘Isn't it the case that the man slept?’
      d. kí ólí ómóhé méhén'-ì            ò.
         SN the man PAP.sleep-F INT
         ‘It isn't the case the man slept, even though you expect he did.’A response to interrogative ki constructions is hèè ‘yes’ followed by an affirmative
declarative, or òghò ‘no’ followed by a negative statement.(147) kí ólí ómóhé gbé'           ófè?
      SN the man PAP.kill rat
      ‘Isn't it the case that the man killed a rat?’
                                                                   Sentence focus | 409      hèè, ó gbé'          óì.        /        òghò, ó ì       gbè óì.
      yes he PAP.kill it                       no    he NEG kill it
      ‘Yes, he killed it.’                     ‘No, he did not kill it.’    ki constructions constrain their matrix clause subject, inflection and occurrence
of auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding preverbs, SN imposes severe restrictions. It
rejects all preverbs: aspectualizer, evaluative, temporal, subject attributive, quantity
and manner-demonstrative. SN ki constructions partially limit aspect. They inflect
for Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective. Thus they disallow
Present perfect, Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective.(148) a. kí ólí óvbékhán fí'           ólí ókpósó úkpóràn?
         SN the youth          PAP.hit the woman stick
         ‘Isn't it the case that the youth hit the woman with a stick?’
      b. kí élí ívbékhán ó ò tò              vbí émà?
         SN the youths SC H fond.of LOC yam
         ‘Isn't it the case that youths are fond of yam?’
      c. kí ólí ómóhé ló           mèhén ò.
         SN the man         PRED sleep INT
         ‘It surely isn't the case that the man will sleep.’     In ki matrix clauses modality auxiliaries are restricted absolutely. One finds nei-
ther deontic (Hortative í) nor epistemic (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba and bia,
Deductive za, Resultative za, Concessive rere, Hypothetical kha). Hypothetical kha
illustrates (*kí ólí ómóhé khà gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.HYP kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case
that the man would have killed a rat?’).
     SN ki clauses completely reject relative tense ke and kpe, as ke shows (*kí ólí
ómóhé ké' gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.ANT kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case that the man
killed a rat afterwards?’).
     SN ki clauses constrain subject shape. They allow proper nouns (òlóló) and def-
inite common nouns: human (ómóhé), animate (ófé) and inanimate (íkpún).32(149) a. kí òlóló gbé'         ólí ófè.
         SN Ololo PAP.kill the rat

        SN the cloths         cloths PAP.burn CS INT
        ‘It surely isn't the case that the cloth pieces burned up.’     ki construction subject phrases restrict some postdeterminers. SN animate sub-
jects modified by the definite article combine with deictic demonstratives ná and áín
(kí ólí ómóhé ná / áín gbé' ófè ò [SN the man this that PAP.kill rat INT] ‘It surely isn't
the case that this / that man killed a rat’). Also acceptable is contrastive demonstra-
tive nóí (kí ómóhé nóí gbé' ófè ò [SN man next PAP.kill rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the
case that the next man killed a rat’).
     In SN subject position kindred forms are partially restricted. Deictic élìyó is
grammatical but contrastive sortal ódàn is not (kí úkpún élìyó / *ódàn ó ò ghàén ò
[SN cloth that.kind different.kind SC H costly INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that
kind of cloth is costly’).
     SN subjects admit only one quantifier, collective universal èrèmé. It occurs, alt-
hough not with the definite article (kí (*élí) éwé èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goats all
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that all the goats entered the
house’). No other quantifier (distributive universal òdóòdé, partitive existential ósò
or contrastive existential óvbèé) occupies SN subject position as modifier.
     Subject phrases in ki matrix clauses allow most numeral modifiers. One finds
collective ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’ (kí íkpún ìgbìgbé tóó' á vbí ólì èràìn ò? [SN cloths all.ten
PAP.burn CS LOC the fire INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case that all ten cloths burned up in
the fire?’) and cardinal èvá ‘two,’ although cardinals require the definite article (kí
élí éfè èvá ó' vbì òò ò? [SN the rat two PAP.enter LOC hole INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case
that two rats entered the hole?’). SN subjects disallow cardinal òkpá ‘one,’ regard-
less of constituent definiteness (*kí ómòhè òkpá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN man one PAP.enter
LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that one man entered the house’), and em-
phatic òkpá ‘alone’ (*kí ólí ómòhè òkpá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the man alone PAP.enter LOC
house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the man alone entered the house’).
     ki subjects accept postnominal modifier phrases. Among the latter are expres-
sions with Associative ísì (kí (ólí) éwé ísì ólí ókpósó ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat ASS the
woman PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the woman's goat
entered the house’), Relator li (kí (ólí) éwé lí óbín' ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat R dark
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the dark goat entered the
house’) and relative clause (kí (ólí) ómóhé lí ó dá' ólí ényó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man
R he PAP.drink the wine PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It isn't the case that the man who
drank the wine killed the rat, although you may have thought so’). In elicited con-
structions, there is a preference for definite article inclusion.
     Subject position in ki constructions imposes greater restrictions on impersonal
pronouns than personal pronouns. It allows subject pronouns for each person and
number.

      SN I you he PAP.kill the rat INT
      ‘It surely isn't the case that I / you / he killed the rat.’As expected, SN subjects never admit emphatic pronouns (*kí mèmè / ìyóín gbé' ólí
ófè ò [SN I he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that I / he killed the rat’).
     SN subjects allow some impersonal pronouns. Among these are contrastive
demonstrative ónóí (kí ónóí ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN next.one PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It
surely isn't the case that the next one entered the house’) and deictic demonstrative
óáín and óná (kí óáín / óná ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN that.one this.one PAP.enter LOC house
INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that one / this one entered the house’). Again, em-
phatic proximal ónánà is preferred (kí ónáná ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN this.very.one PAP.enter
LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that this very one entered the house’).
     As SN subject, kindred forms are constrained absolutely. Neither deictic élìyó
nor contrastive ódàn are acceptable (*kí élìyó / ódán ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN that.kind differ-
ent.kind PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that kind / different
kind of one entered the house’).
     ki construction subjects restrict most quantifier pronouns. They do allow collec-
tive universal èrèmé (kí èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN all PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely
isn't the case that all entered the house’). But remaining quantifiers, distributive
universal òdóòdé, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé, are unacceptable.
     ki subjects limit most numeral pronouns.33 Neither cardinals (e.g. èvá) nor col-
lectives (e.g. èvèvá) occur (*kí èvá / èvèvá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN two all.two PAP.enter LOC
house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that two of them entered the house’). úkpòkpá
‘one,’ although only as partitive phrase head, appears as SN subject (kí úkpòkpá vbí
ó húnmé'-ì ò [SN one LOC it PAP.be.good-F INT] ‘It isn't the case that one from them
is good, although you may have thought so’). But cardinal òkpá ‘one’ fails (*kí òkpá
húnmé'-ì ò [SN one PAP.be.good-F INT] ‘It isn't the case that one is good’).
     In SN subject position one also finds more complex pronoun constituents.
Among these are pronominal attributives (kí ólí óbín' gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the dark.one
PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the dark one killed the rat’) and
pronominally headed relatives without Recurrent preverb a (kí ólí ó *á dé' ólí úkpún
gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN one he RC PAP.buy the cloth PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the
case that the one who bought the cloth killed the rat’).
     SN constructions greatly limit expression of polarity and mood. They appear as
polar interrogatives (kí ólí ómóhé shén' ólì émà? [SN the man PAP.sell the yam] ‘Isn't
it the case that the man sold the yam?’). However, they never occur as negative
statements, imperatives or prohibitives, as unacceptable negatives suggest (kí ólí
ómóhé í ì shèn ólì émà? [SN the man SC NEG sell the yam] ‘Isn't it the case that the
man did not sell the yam?’).
412 | Noncanonical constructions    Additional precedence constraints affect SN kí in complex sentences. SN never
precedes subjects under indicative khi, conditional si or subjunctive li.(151) a. *òjè één-í          khí kí ólí ómóhé é'               émà ò.

         ‘Isn't it the case that Oje wants the woman to sell the yam?’But in complex sentences, SN ki never precedes both a matrix clause and an embed-
ded S-complement.(153) *kí ójé míáá' òhí sí              kí áléké shén'         émà?
       SN Oje PAP.ask Ohi COND SN Aleke PAP.sell yam
       ‘Isn’t it that Oje asked Ohi if it isn't the case that Aleke sold yam.’     There are also restrictions on SN ki with other syntactically subordinate claus-
es.34 ki does not precede subjects in subordinate adverbial clauses, for example tem-
poral Anterior ke (*kí ólí ómóhé ké' é émàè léé, ó ó' shèn ólí émà? [SN the man

7.7 Noncanonical construction co-occurrence
Constructions reflecting sentence affirmation, sentence negation, positive focus,
negative focus, topic, right dislocation and information question types are con-
strained in their ability to co-occur. For constructions that relate a discourse defined
position to a corresponding grammatical relation, compatibility is possible only
with distinct grammatical relations. No two constructions are compatible when
affecting the same grammatical relation.
     Sentence affirmation and sentence negation establish a baseline for assessing
construction compatibility. Of the two, sentence negation is more restricted. SA érí'
and SN ki are compatible, although érí' must precede ki (*kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé' ófè
[SN SA the man PAP.kill rat] ‘It is not the case, indeed, that the man killed a rat’).(154) érí' kí ólí ómóhé gbé'           ófè.
      SA SN the man PAP.kill rat
      ‘Indeed, it is not the case that the man killed a rat.’Sentence affirmation is restricted with other constructions. It appears with topicali-
zation and RD but never with positive focus, negative focus or direct questions. As
shown below, SA and topicalization are compatible, provided the matrix clause
shows relative tense Anterior ke (*ólí ómòhè, érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man SA he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the man, indeed he killed the rat’). Also below, SA érí' fol-
lows a topic noun phrase (*érí' ólí ómòhè, ó ké' gbé ólí ófè [SA the man he PAP.ANT
kill the rat] ‘Indeed, as for the man, he killed the rat afterward’).(155) a. ólí ómòhè, érí' ó ké'           gbé ólí ófè.
         the man       SA he PAP.ANT kill the rat
         ‘As for the man, indeed he killed the rat afterward.’
      b. òjè, érí' á à ké nwù óí gbúdú.
         Oje SA one H ANT take him squirming.fashion
         ‘As for Oje, indeed he was afterward taken squirming.’Sentence affirmation and right dislocation are compatible. érí' precedes a matrix
clause whose subject or direct object relation corresponds to the RD constituent.(156) a. érí' ó gbé'      ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè.
         SA he PAP.kill rat ID be the man
         ‘Indeed he killed a rat, that is the man.’
      b. érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'         óì, í khì ólí ófè.
         SA the man PAP.kill it ID be the rat
         ‘Indeed the man killed it, that is the rat.’
414 | Noncanonical constructionsWhen matrix verb takes both direct and indirect object, sentence affirmation and
right dislocation combine only when the direct object is right dislocated. érí' is un-
acceptable when subject or indirect object corresponds to the RD constituent.(157) a. érí' ójé shén'     óì ní    ólì òkpòsò, í khì ólí úkpùn.
         SA Oje PAP.sell it APP the woman ID be the cloth
         ‘Indeed Oje sold it to the woman, that is the cloth.’
      b. *érí ó shén'       ólí úkpùn ní ólì òkpòsò, í khì òjè.
          SA he PAP.sell the cloth APP the woman ID be Oje
          ‘Indeed, he sold the cloth to the woman, that is Oje.’
      c. *érí' ójé shén'     ólí úkpùn ní áìn, í khì ólì òkpòsò.
          SA Oje PAP.sell the cloth APP her ID be the woman
          ‘Indeed Oje sold the cloth to her, that is the woman.’      Sentence affirmation does not precede or follow positive focus li/ni (*érí' ólí ófè
lí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [SA the rat PF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, it was the rat that the
man killed’, *ólí ómóhé lí érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man PF SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was
the man, indeed, who killed the rat’), negative focus ki (*érí' ólí ómóhé kí ó gbé' ólí
ófè [SA the man NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘Indeed, it wasn’t the rat that the man killed’,
*ólí ófè kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [the rat NF SA the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It wasn’t the rat
that indeed the man killed’) or information question frames (*óé' érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè?
[who SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘Who indeed killed the rat?’, *érí' émé' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì?
[SA what the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, what did the man kill?’).
      Sentence negation co-occurs with only two construction types, although in nei-
ther does SN ki occur clause initially. As indicated previously, sentence negation co-
occurs with sentence affirmation provided ki follows érí'. In addition, SN combines
with topicalization. It never combines with positive focus, negative focus, right
dislocation or information questions.
      Sentence negation co-occurs with topicalization as shown immediately below,
provided the topic phrase precedes ki (*kì ólí ómòhè, ó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man he
PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case that as for the man, he killed the rat).(158) ólí ómòhè, kí ó gbé'            ólí ófè ò.
      the man      SN he PAP.kill the rat INT
      ‘As for the man, it isn't the case that he killed the rat, you know.","[434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"
"17
     Temporal coincidence with bíì phrases does not correspond to verbs in series.(i) a. *ó víé'        húá ìwàwà.
        she PAP.cry take pots
        ‘She cried and carried pots.’
    b. *ó húá'         ìwàwà víé.
        she PAP.take pots cry
        ‘She carried pots crying.’18
  Matrix clauses in causal circumstance accept manner-demonstrative preverbs ìyó and ìná. They
are interpreted as coreferential with the subordinate circumstantial clause; they are manner
proforms with subordinate clause as antecedent. Nonetheless, ìyó and ìná do not exhibit parallel
distribution. Each occurs in focus position relative to a matrix clause, thereby immediately follow-
ing its antecedent circumstantial clause, which itself occurs in topic position. Constructions with
manner proforms in focus position require Manner preverb i in the matrix clause.(i) a. ébé' òhí í'          gbé ólí éwè, ìyó lí ó í'                   é óí ògbòn.

           PMD PF you PRED MAN take it APP me
      ‘Since this morsel of yam is very fresh now, it is this way you will give it to me.’In other constructions, ìyó appears in matrix clause preverb position; ìná does not.

         as he PAP.MAN take wood he PAP.PMD enter LOC house
          ‘Since he carried wood, he in this way entered the house.’Manner-demonstrative adverbials do not occur in postverbal position in the matrix clause of a
circumstantial construction.(iii) a. *ébé' ó í'            húá éràn, ó ó'           vbí íwé ìyó.

          ‘Since he carried the wood, he entered the house this way.’19
   Unlike ébé'/ébí', élàbé/élàbí does not participate in temporal coincidence of circumstance con-
structions framed by Punctual aspectualizer ghe.(i) a. ébé' ó ghé'         ì     dá    ólí ényò léé,     òhí vá'rè.
       as he PAP.PCT MAN drink the wine TEMP Ohi PAP.come

        as     he PAP.PCT MAN drink the wine TEMP Ohi PAP.come
        ‘Just as he finished drinking the wine, Ohi came.’20
  Aside from circumstantial extent, se is found in three other constructions (Chapter 6, 6.1.6, Chap-
ter 7, 7.5.2.3, and Chapter 11, 11.3). As a verb with a locative complement, it designates directional
motion.(i) ò sé                     vbì ìwè.
    he PRP.move.as.far.as LOC house
    ‘He moved as far as the house.’As a verb in series and with an optional complement, se specifies that an event is sufficient relative
to cultural norms. (Chapter 11, 11.6.1)(ii) a. ò dá         ényò sé.
        he PRP.drink wine be.sufficient
        ‘He drank enough wine. / He drank wine to a sufficient extent.’
     b. ò dá          ényò sé       vbí ékò.
        he PRP.drink wine reach LOC limit
        ‘He drank wine to the limit.’The verb se is also found as an obligatory constituent in questions of extent, where it combines with
ébé'/ébí' and Manner preverb i. Such questions invite responses with quantity preverb zemi.
                                                                                 Endnotes | 963

         how he PAP.MAN have strength reach he PRP.ABSI have strength
         ‘How much strength does he have?’   ‘He has a lot of strength.’21
  Matrix clauses in extent constructions accept manner-demonstrative ìyó, not ìná as proforms.
Antecedents for ìyó occur as subordinate circumstantial extent clauses.(i) ébé' í í'           móé étìn        sé,
    as I PAP.MAN have strength reach
       í gbó'        ìyó' / *íná' ré óì vbíéé óì.
       I PAP.ADD DMD PMD use it show him
    ‘Since I have such strength, I also that way used it to show him too.’Maintaining the same discourse function, manner-demonstrative ìyó also appears in focus position
relative to a matrix clause, thereby allowing ìyó to immediately follow the subordinate extent
clause.(ii) ébé' í í'          móé étìn         sé,     ìyó lí í gbó'         ì     ré óì vbíéé óì.
     as I PAP.MAN have strength reach DMD PF I PAP.ADD MAN use it show him
     ‘Since I have such strength, so it is that I also used it to show him too.’22
  Information in matrix clauses linked to extent clauses is queried by questions framed by
ébé'/ébí'...i...se that convey erstwhile subordinate clause information. Responses require normative
extent se, its vbi phrase and its extraposed khi complement expressing the erstwhile matrix clause
proposition.(i) ébé' ó í'            é émàè sé?
    how she PAP.MAN eat food reach
    ‘How much food did she eat?’
    ó é'          émàè sé      vbì ò khí ó ì         ké   mìtí fì étìn.

    ‘She ate food until she was not able to breathe anymore.’23
  As with S-complement subjunctives (Chapter 13, 13.2.4), purposive li…í clauses show a unique
pattern vis-à-vis modality marking and grammatical subject shape. With pronominal subjects, li
clauses show deontic Hortative i. With lexical subjects, li clauses reveal no overt Hortative.(i) a. ò sá         àmè lí        yán í      kpè dé ényò ní áìn.

966 | Multi-clause constructions

  Exceptive marker sòkpén appears derived from an idiomatic serial verb sequence so ‘to touch’ and
kpen ‘be next to.’ Although not widely used at present, this sequence manifests an exclusionary
sense consistent with sòkpén. In addition, this marker seems more prominent in the neighboring
Ora dialect than in Emai.(i) a. è    só         kpén    óí vbí ékùèè ré.
       they PRP.touch next.to him LOC meeting arrive
       ‘They excluded him from the meeting.’
    b. è    só         kpén    óí vbì ò ré.
       they PRP.touch next.to him LOC it arrive
       ‘They excluded him from it.’28
 A noteable exception, however, is that cross clause subjects in sòkpén constructions where a
whole-part relation (e.g. áléké ~ áwé óì) exists are acceptable.(i) áléké ó ò jàjá               sòkpén khí áwé óì kèré        gbè.
    Aleke SC H be.energetic except IND legs her be. small t oo.much
    ‘Alekei is energetic except that heri legs are too small.’29
  When the òhíó khi clause is in focus position preceding li/ni, a polar question is allowed. When
òhíó khi is in topic position, a polar question is disallowed.(i) a. òhíó khí òhí kéè            gbé ófè ní áìn lí ólí ómó ó ò rè gbé?
        cause IND Ohi PRP.ANT kill rat APP him PF the child SC H take dance
        ‘Was it because Ohi afterward killed a rat for him that the child dances?’
    b. *òhíó khí òhí kéè          gbé ófè ní áìn, ólí ómò ò ó gbé?
        cause IND Ohi PRP.ANT kill rat APP him the child SC C dance
        ‘Was it because Ohi afterward killed a rat for him that the child is dancing?’30
   Clauses headed by èmìdí and òhíó exhibit asymmetric behavior with respect to their constituent
clause verb types. Clauses marked by òhíó and èmìdí fail to exhibit the same causal force across verb
pairs. For paired events denoted by o ‘enter’ and mie ‘see’ or moe ‘have’ and nwu li ‘give,’ only òhíó
is acceptable, not èmìdí. The principle behind this constraint is not clear at this time.(i) a. ó ó'             vbì ìwè òhíó khì ò míé            òhí.
        he PAP.enter LOC house cause IND he PRP.see Ohi
        ‘He entered the house because he saw Ohi.’
    b. *ò ó             vbì ìwè     èmìdí khì ò míé        òhí.

    d. *èmìdí khí í ì         mòè éghó' lí ú       yà      ré nwù ékpén nì èmé.

  Phrases headed by èrímí never appear in canonical declaratives as direct objects of re ‘take’ in
series.(i) *òhí ré'       èrímí ísì ólì òkpòsò váré'.
     Ohi PAP.take behalf ASS the woman come
     ‘Ohi came on behalf of the woman.’32
  It is not only èrímí phrases that restrict information questions. èrímí’s complement also fails to
take an interrogative pronoun.(i) a. èrímí' mè lí ójé ré'           yé       òkè.
        behalf me PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
        ‘It was on my behalf that Oje went to Oke.’
    b. *èrímí' óé' lí ójé ré'           yé      òkè?
        behalf who PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
        ‘On whose behalf did Oje go to Oke?’33
  Benefactive èrímí and causal òhíó associatives exhibit contrasting interpretations of their associ-
ated possessor location. With òkpòsò ‘woman’ as possessor, òhíó assumes the woman to be in the
target location, therefore implying (ib), while èrímí phrases make the opposite assumption, imply-
ing (id).(i) a. òhíó ísì òkpòsò lí ójé ré'            yé       áfúzé'.
       cause ASS woman PF Oje PAP.take move.to Afuze
       ‘It was for the sake of a woman that Ohi went to Afuze.’
    b. ólì òkpòsò ríì        vbí áfúzé'.
       the woman PRP.be LOC Afuze
       ‘The woman is in Afuze.’
    c. èrímí ísì ólì òkpòsò lí ójé ré'            yé        áfúzé'.
       behalf ASS the woman PF Oje PAP.take move.to Afuze
       ‘It was for the woman's sake that Oje went to Afuze.’
    d. ólì òkpòsò í ì        è vbí áfúzé'.
       the woman SC NEG be LOC Afuze
       ‘The woman is not in Afuze.’34
  Despite these ellipted structures, da never precedes both affirmative and negative clause in multi-
clause constructions. Nor does da ever occur at the end of a clause.(i) a. *dà ò dé'         ólí úkpùn dà ó ì        dè ólí úkpùn?
        or he PAP.buy the cloth or he NEG buy the cloth
        ‘Or did he buy the cloth or did he not buy the cloth?’

     Here it is. It is I who am called Monday. Do you not see these people who live in
this very place? It is as eye witnesses that all live in this very place.
     There were two women who were in the village. They were called Aaegbe and
Ionlesen. These two women, they were more beautiful than anything that had ever
yet been experienced. This one who was called Aaegbe, she was beauty beyond
measure. Witness this thing. These are women? Where among womankind did these
ones come from? So Aaegbe prepared her things. She told Ionlesen, there is no other
job that one will do other than prostitution. That one said it. It isn’t so, is it?
     This Aaegbe who must have had this conversation, a wound made havoc on her
leg. It is with a rag that she wraps it. But it was this Aaegbe alone that men liked
more, it is they who searched up and down for her. She said, “Look at it, Ionlesen,
since it was discovered that it is I that men are fond of, one surely hasn’t found how
one will deal with it. But the wound which is on this leg of mine, this leg will be
exchanged for another one.” Ionlesen said, “It isn’t so is it? The money that will be
made afterward, it will be mixed together.” Aegbe said, “It will be mixed together. It
will be saved and used to eat food.” Ionlesen said, “It is fine.”
     Just as they were having this conversation, three young men came. At once,
they knocked on the door, ratatattat. Yes, Aaegbe said, “I say that I have come.
What are you searching for?” They said, “Aaegbe. I say that we will take you to La-
gos.” Aaegbe said, “Lagos? Ionlesen, I say come, this wound, it does not know how
to become large. When I remove the cloth from it, I say that men will disperse and
run away.” Ionlesen said, “There isn’t anything else to do. I will just hold it for you.”
980 | Sample oral narrativeIonlesen then said, “Aaegbe, I say bring your leg.” So they exchanged legs with
each other. Each leg locked into place. Aaegbe then said, “It isn’t so, is it?” Aaegbe
then said, I want to bathe. So she bathed don’t you know. Ionlesen picked out her
things. She then said, “I am coming, in order to enter the room.” After she glanced
about, she did not see Aaegbe. So she started to sing a song.
    SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
    Don’t you see it? One does not lead another one on to some place, as might be
thought. I wonder whether you are seeing it. As a result, Ionlesen picked out her
things. She approached the door. She then said, “A group of young men of this
kind.’ She then said, “I ask you for the person I am searching for.” One said, “Who
are you surely searching for?” Ionlesen said, “Who do you surely search for?” Ion-
lesen then said, “Aaegbe.” One said, “It is beauty that has overtaken her.” Another
said, “Yes, Aaegbe, she picked out her things just recently, she proceeded to Afuze,
don’t you know.” Ionlesen also put her legs to walking.
    SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not

    “A plight,” Ionlesen then said, “A plight is this one. Aaegbe.” Ionlesen started
walking. She reached Afuze. One said, “Just recently Aaegbe came out from this
room. When you see her, she and the men, she took the men to her. When they posi-
tion each other noisily, they crash onto the ground from the bed. They make noises
with their bodies. They crash on the ground from the bed. They make noises with
their bodies. They thump on the mat.” One said, “How will one deal with this one?”
One said, “Aaegbe, I say that she just came out recently. She proceeded to Otuo.”
Ionlesen said yes, it is walking that I have started. I intend to do goodness, I do it
but what do I get in return? So she started to sing a song.
    SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not

    Don’t you see it? So Ionlesen reached Otou. After she reached Otuo, she encoun-
tered young men assessing each other. Some were jumping away at the window. She
then said, “I ask you please, rescue me.” One asked her, “What happened to you?”
She said, “It is Aaegbe I search for.” One said, “Aaegbe? She just picked up her
                                                 Two Women, a Wound and a Rag | 981things recently, she proceeded to Benin City.” Ionlesen said that the place where I
should happen to move to is the place where I start out from. So Ionlesen then
picked out her things.
      SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
      It is just so, isn’t it? So Ionlesen started on her journey, briskly moving on. So
she reached Benin City, don’t you know. After she reached Benin City, she encoun-
tered that the entirety of the young men, they were seething a great deal. Sweat was
overcoming everyone completely on their shoulder blade. Ionlesen said, “How?”
Ionlesen said, “I say that it is Aaegbe I am searching for.” One said he took one
woman who was beautiful in that way just recently. Another said, “Yes, she picked
out her things. She said she was going to Lagos.” Ionlesen then said, “Is it I who am
this one? The wound will infest me today. I will be infested by this wound today.
The wound, it is, Aaegbe then told me, take, hold it for me. I held the wound for her.
It is an act of goodness that I performed.” So Ionlesen walked to Lagos.
      SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a

Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
      That is how it is. There passed one market week, one fortnight, walking is what
Ionlesen did. It is she. Her toes were about to wither away on the road to Lagos. “I
will just ensure that I will see her today.” Ionlesen, she shuffled into Lagos. The
people said, “Greetings.” Another said, “Greetings.” This one said, “Greetings.” She
then said, “This thing you speak, this is not the language I know. I say that it is a
person I search for. There is no one who will give me a helping hand?” One said,
“Whom do you search for?” She said, “One small girl that is called Aaegbe.” One
said, “Go into that room, you will meet her in there.” So Ionlesen entered the room
don’t you know. It was men she met. She said, “I ask you about the woman you
carried into this room.” One said, “Yes, it is Aaegbe who proceeded to Ajegunle and
entered inside Lagos. What? Ajegunle inside Lagos.” “Is it Ajegunle that she now
entered?” He then said, “It is just so.”
      SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not

982 | Sample oral narrative     It is that way that one experienced it don’t you know. So Ionlesen reached
Ajegunle. After she was coming, she encountered young men. What does one now
call this kind of person? “I ask you to allow me to pass, for it is a person I am search-
ing for.” One said, “I say that Aaegbe is just in the room.” After Ionlesen came to the
room, she found that Aaegbe had plaited the hair with an enticing hair style (one-
looks-at-me-does-not-look-elsewhere). Ionlesen then said, “Aaegbe, I am coming so
that your wound should infest you, so that this wound should infest you. You asked
me to hold your wound for you. The wound, you gave it to me. You shuffled into
Lagos. It is I who now experienced suffering.” Aaegbe who is infested with a wound,
she is beautiful throughout. Aaegbe, take the wound. Ionlesen said, “It was surely
not discovered how one will deal with it. Since it happened this way, bring your
shin in order that we should exchange them, in order for you to take hold of your
wound.” Aaegbe pulled her buttocks near her back. I say that it is so, isn’t it? Ion-
lesen said, “I intend to also now reach womanhood of my own and exhibit beauty
like you. For, indeed, we should reach womanhood together.” So Aaegbe brought
her shin. So Ionlesen brought her shin. So they each fit their own shin into place.
This is the reason that when a person bruises a leg at the shin, the wound it makes
on the shin is messy. The story just finishes that way.

         ‘Oje bought the cloth but he sewed it in vain.’In their affirmative clause, àmáà constructions inflect for Present perfect or prospec-
tive Predictive. They reject Past perfect, imperfect and prospective.(288) a. ólí ómòhè dé         ólí úkpùn àmáà ó ì           sò óì.

         ‘The man will buy the cloth, but he will not sew it.’Constructions with àmáà limit subject coreference across clauses. Subject identity is
required. Disjoint subject reference is unacceptable.(289) *ólí ómòhè dé        úkpùn àmáà ólì òkpòsò í ì         sò óì.

       ‘The man bought cloth, but the woman did not sew it.’14.8.2 Contrastive complement beeIn multi-clause constructions, the contrastive nature of S-complements is signaled
by bee ‘whereas.’ Its distribution is constrained to a preceding e ‘say’ clause show-
954 | Multi-clause constructionsing an indicative khi clause. Neither subjunctive li nor conditional si occurs in a
similar fashion.(290) a. óbá' ré'            é khí yón khà          gbè òhí,

             whereas he PRP.know IND lie         be
          ‘The Obai intended to kill Ohi, whereas hei knew it was a lie.’Clauses in bee constructions are strictly ordered. The ‘say’ clause and its khi com-
plement cannot follow the subordinate bee clause. While bee clauses fail independ-
ent of another clause, they never initiate a discourse.(291) a. *béé      óbá' één'         khì èhèìn óò,
          whereas Oba PAP.know IND lie           be

           whereas ASS siblings his be
           ‘Whereas it was his sibling.’14.8.3 Disjunctive clause dàA disjunctive relation between events is framed by dà ‘or.’ It requires a polarity con-
trast, even more stringent than àmáà. In addition to an affirmative~negative con-
trast across clauses, disjunctive dà requires identity of verb and interrogative mood.
Disjunctives in declarative form or with contrasting verbs (e.g. de ‘buy’ and so ‘sew’)
are unacceptable.

          Oje PRP.buy the cloth or Oje SC NEG sew the cloth
          ‘Did Oje buy the cloth or did Oje sew the cloth?’Clauses within disjunctive constructions are strictly ordered. The affirmative clause
precedes the negative clause. The reverse order is unacceptable.(293) a. ò dé          ólí úkpùn dà ó ì         dè ólí úkpùn?

          he NEG buy the cloth or he PRP.buy the cloth
          ‘Did he not buy the cloth or did he buy the cloth?’Clauses in dà disjunctives co-relate with respect to inflection. Expression of negative
polarity is not limited to Perfect Negation. When Perfect Negation is in the negative
clause, Present perfect is in the affirmative. When prospective Predictive ló occurs in
the affirmative clause, Prospective Negation kha appears in the negative.(294) a. ò dé          ólí úkpùn dà ó ì           dè ólí úkpùn?

         he PRED buy the cloth or he PRONEG buy the cloth
         ‘Will hei buy the cloth or will hei not buy the cloth?’The negative polarity condition for disjunctive dà is not met by the ba kun predicate,
the Prohibitive construction or Negative Focus.(295) a. *ò dé          ólí úkpùn dà ò dè            ólí úkpùn bá kùn?
          he PRP.buy the cloth or he PRP.buy the cloth do.in.vain
          ‘Did he buy the cloth or did he buy the cloth in vain?’
      b. *dè ólí úkpùn dà é è dé ólí úkpùn?
          buy the cloth or you PR buy the cloth
          ‘Buy the cloth or don't buy the cloth?’
956 | Multi-clause constructions     c. *òjè lí ó dé'        úkpùn dà òjè kí ó dé'             úkpùn?
         Oje PF he PAP.buy cloth or Oje NF he PAP.buy cloth
         ‘Is it Oje who bought cloth or isn't it Oje who bought cloth?’Disjunctives reject Past perfect in affirmative disjunct and Perfect Negation in nega-
tive disjunct, just as they do Anticipative in the affirmative disjunct and Prospective
Negation in the negative.(296) a. *ójé dé'         ólí úkpùn dà òjè í ì          dè ólí úkpùn?

          Oje ANTI buy the cloth or Oje SC PRONEG buy the cloth
          ‘Is Oje about to buy the cloth or will Oje not buy the cloth?’    Across clauses, disjunctive dà constructions require subject coreference. Dis-
joint subject reference is unacceptable.(297) *òjè dé         ólí úkpùn dà ólì òkpòsò dé           ólí úkpùn?
       Oje PRP.buy the cloth or the woman PRP.buy the cloth
       ‘Did Oje buy the cloth or did the woman buy the cloth?’It is not only grammatical relations across clauses that require identity but also their
grammatical shapes. Thus, either lexical nouns or pronouns serve as clause subject
but not a lexical noun in one clause and a pronoun in the other. Similarly, direct
objects are constrained. Unacceptable are a lexical noun in one clause and a pro-
noun in the other.(298) a. *ólí ómòhè dé         ólí úkpùn dà ó ì        dè óì?
          the man PRP.buy the cloth or he NEG buy it

          the man PRP.buy it or he NEG buy the cloth
          ‘Did the man buy it or did he not buy the cloth?’In narrative discourse, disjunctive dà occurs with one clause ellipted. Either an
affirmative or negative clause is found preceded by da.34(299) dà ó dé         ólí úkpùn? / dà ó ì      dè ólí úkpùn?
      or he PRP.buy the cloth      or he NEG buy the cloth
      ‘Or did he buy the cloth?’   ‘Or did he not buy the cloth?’

    Perceptual verbs lacking intentionality (i.e. míé ‘see’) fail with kha in perfect condition clauses.(i) *ò khà       míé óvbí óì, ò gbé             évìè á.
     he PRP.HYP see child his he PRP.break tears CS
     ‘When he saw his child, he burst into tears.’2
 Subordinate clauses in imperfect condition constructions require intentionality verbs. Verbs failing
to exhibit this property render the construction unacceptable.(i) *ò khà       áà míé òhí, ò ó            vbì ìwè.
     he PRP.HYP RC see Ohi he PRP.enter LOC house
     ‘Whevever he saw Ohi, he entered the house.’3
  Additional constructions reveal the positional properties of Recurrent a relative to auxiliaries and
other preverbs. When kha, Recurrent a, Anticipative lo and Anterior ke co-occur in the same clause,
Recurrent a precedes ló and ke and follows Hypothetical kha. When an imperfect condition subordi-
nate clause shows Anticipative, Ingressive and Anterior forms, Recurrent a precedes them but
follows the Hypothetical.(i) ólí éìn      khà     á ló     yà ké nwú émàè, ólí ényè fí               òrùn.
    the tortoise PRP.HYP RC ANTI IG ANT take food the snake PRP.throw voice
    ‘Whenever the tortoise wanted to take food afterward, the snake shouted.’When an indefinite condition subordinate clause shows relative tense Anterior ke and the Additive
aspectualizer gbo, Recurrent a follows both and immediately precedes the verb.(ii) ò khà       ké gbò áà é émàè léé, ò lá                  lé'.
     he PRP.HYP ANT ADD RC eat food TEMP he PRP.run depart
     ‘Whenever he finished eating food afterward, he ran away.’Likewise, when aspectualizers Punctual ghe and Additive gbo co-occur, Recurrent a follows them
but precedes the verb.(iii) a. ò khà       ghé gbò áà é émàè léé, ò lá                   lé'.

         he PRP.HYP ADD PCT RC eat food TEMP he PRP.run depart
         ‘Whenever he just finished eating food too, he ran away.’When Additive gbo and a subject attributive (dégbè) or quantity (zézè) preverb are present, Recur-
rent a follows gbo.

        ‘Whenever he also ate a bit of food, he ran away.’Recurrent a can occur repeatedly in a subordinate clause and thus bring an emphatic quality to
indefinite condition constructions. Extensive reliance on this emphatic strategy is found in tradi-
tional narrative discourse. Emphatic structures require that Recurrent a precedes the verb and each
auxiliary or preverb except the Hypothetical.(v) a. ò khà         á gbó á vàdé, ò lá               lé'.

        ‘Whenever it was about to see Ohi, it drew its head in.’4
  Matrix clauses in prospective condition constructions correspond to émé'/émí' ‘what’ in ruan
‘happen’ questions with Predictive ló. Erstwhile subordinate information appears as si complement.
Responses correspond to matrix clause.(i) émé' ó ló      rùàn    sí     ó ó'     dè émà? >          ó ló       ù.
    what it PRED happen COND he CON buy yam                   he PRED die
    ‘What will happen if he goes to buy yam?’                 ‘He will die.’5
  In addition, direct questions framed by émé'/émí', kha and ruan ‘happen’ elicit responses consist-
ing of matrix clause information from a possible counter-to-fact condition construction.(i) émé' ó khà        rúán?               > ólí ókpósó khà      ú.
    what it PAP.HYP happen                  the woman PAP.HYP die
    ‘What would have happened?’             ‘The woman would have died.’Clause information in possible counterfactual condition constructions does not correspond to ques-
tions framed by émé'/émí', kha, u ‘happen’ and a si-marked conditional clause. Questions with
erstwhile subordinate clause information in a si clause do not accept as response the erstwhile
matrix clause proposition.

     *áléké khà       ní.
      Aleke PAP.HYP survive
      ‘Aleke would have survived.’Counterfactuality grounded to a reversible condition is also framed by Deductive za in the matrix
clause and Hypothetical kha in the subordinate clause. Addition of kha to the matrix clause is unac-
ceptable.(iii) a. ó khà          béé vbí ó lì èdèdé, ò záà              fóó    óì.

          he PAP.HYP start LOC it R earlier he PAP.HYP DED finish it
          ‘If he had started it earlier, he would have finished it.’Properties of counterfactuals with kha and za in different clauses are constrained much as kha…kha
constructions. One essential difference concerns aspect. kha za frames inflect for Present perfect
(right edge low tone subject). They reject Past perfect.(iv) *ó khà         béé vbí ó lì èdèdé, ó zá'             fóó   óì.

  When condition si clauses accept relative tense kpe, they require Anticipative ló. As a conse-
quence, si clauses show a purposive rather than necessary condition interpretation. Condition si
clauses with purposive meaning reject Anterior ke.(i) ò ó sò íòò sì            òjè ló     kpè ré émì ní áìn.

  The Concessive simple form re rarely serves to mark Concessive ‘although, even though’ relations
in multi-clause constructions.","[978, 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985]"
"8.1.5.2 Partitive ri / e
A Partitive (PAR) function distinct from EXT and LCT is expressed by predicates ri
and e: NP ri vbi o and NP e vbi o. Its construction consists of an initial noun phrase,
either of the verbs ri or e, and a vbi complement consisting of the nondeictic locative
pronoun. PAR asserts a partitive relation between a subject referent and an assumed
456 | Be, do, happen and haveplurality indexed by nondeictic locative pronoun ò. Canonical PAR constructions
restrict their grammatical shape in the fashion of Existential constructions.
     PAR constructions exhibit few properties normally associated with verbs. ri in-
flects for aspect with an irregular tone pattern and fails to allow auxiliaries and
preverbs. Regarding aspect, PAR ri permits Present perfect (right edge low tone
subject and a high low verb tone). In typical verb phrases, high low tone occurs on
auxiliaries and preverbs, not verbs. Morever, PAR ri fails to inflect for imperfect or
prospective aspect.(83) ólí ómòhè ríì     vbì ò.
     the man PRP.be LOC them
     ‘The man is among them.’PAR e constructions never show aspect in the affirmative. They fail to inflect for
perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(84) a. *ólí ómóhé ló      è vbì ò.
         the man PRED be LOC them
         ‘The man will be among them.’
     b. *ólí ómóhé ó ò è vbì ò.
         the man SC H be LOC them
         ‘The man was among them.’     PAR constructions, regardless of ri or e as predicate, do not accept any auxilia-
ries or preverbs, as suggested by unacceptable epistemic Certaintive ma, relative
tense kpe, aspectualizer preverb Repetitive che and evaluative preverb kuku, among
others (*ólí ómóhé má' / kpé' / ché' / kú'kù rì vbì ò [the man PAP.CER SUB REP EVAL
be LOC them] ‘The man surely / yet / again / after all was among them’).
     In PAR constructions polarity and mood are limited. ri constructions occur as
polar interrogatives (ólí ómòhè ríì vbì ò? [the man PRP.be LOC them] ‘Is the man
among them?’) but never as negatives (*ólí ómòhè í ì rì vbì ò [the man SC NEG be LOC
them] ‘The man was not among them’) or as imperatives or prohibitives.
     PAR e constructions require Perfect Negation. In addition, they appear as polar
interrogatives but never as imperatives or prohibitives.(85) a. ómòhè í ì       è vbì ò.

     he we PRP.be LOC them
     ‘He is / We are among them.’PAR subject position limits NP type but not animacy and syntactic shape. PAR sub-

áwà, inanimate ìtébù) or definiteness marking.(88) a. ómòhè / ólí ómòhè ríì          vbì ò.

        table    the table PRP.be LOC them
        ‘A table / The table is among them.’     PAR accepts some postdeterminers in subject position. One finds deictic
demonstratives nà and áìn (ólí ómóhé nà / áìn ríì vbì ò [the man this that PRP.be LOC
them] ‘This / That man is among them’), cardinal numerals, e.g. èvá (ímòhè èvá rì vbì
ò [men two PAP.be LOC them] ‘Two men are among them’), partitive existential
quantifier ósò (ómóhé ósò ríì vbì ò [man certain PRP.be LOC them] ‘A certain man is
among them’) and deictic kindred élìyó (ékpá élìyó rì vbì ò [bag that.kind PAP.be
LOC them] ‘A bag of that kind is among them’). However, PAR subject disallows
contrastive demonstrative (nóì), contrastive existential (óvbèé), contrastive kindred
(ódàn) in addition to collective numerals (e.g. èvèvá) and universal quantifiers
(èrèmé, òdóòdè).
     PAR subject permits nonlexical postdeterminers. Allowed are associative ísì
(ékpá ísì òhí rì vbì ò [bag ASS Ohi PAP.be LOC them] ‘Ohi’s bag is among them’),
attributive li (ékpá lí óbín' rì vbì ò [bag R dark PAP.be LOC them] ‘A dark bag is

458 | Be, do, happen and have     PAR subject position partially restricts impersonal pronouns.16 It allows pro-
nouns for deictic demonstrative ònà and óáìn (ònà / óáìn ríì vbì ò [this.one that.one

and deictic kindred élìyó (élìyó rì vbì ò [that.kind.one PAP.be LOC them] ‘That kind is

tential (óvbèé), universal quantifier (èrèmé, òdóòdé) and collective numerals (e.g.

     Noun phrase positions in PAR constructions respond asymmetrically to reposi-
tioning in discourse. ri and e constructions behave dissimilarly as well. With ri, PAR
subject corresponds to a constituent designated as positive focus li/ni, negative
focus ki, or topic. PAR subject fails to correspond to an interrogative pronoun. In e
constructions, PAR subject never corresponds to a constituent in focus, topic or
question word position. Similarly restricted are vbi complements, which fail to cor-
respond to any discourse position: focus, topic or question word.(89) a. ògbòbè        òkpá lí ó rì        vbì ò.

Emai employs a single form u to express transitive and intransitive ‘do.’ Although a
verb, u has no gerundive form (*úùmí).(90) a. ólì òkpòsò ú         óì.
        the woman PRP.do it
        ‘The woman did it.’

tinctive properties. Verb phrase properties pertain to polarity and mood, verb suffix-
es, inflection, auxiliary categories, preverb categories and postverbal particles.
Noun phrase properties include NP type, animacy, syntactic shape and correspond-
ence to discourse defined positions. This same u form, in collocation with particular
nouns, also expresses a range of meanings translated as ‘act, behave, execute,
achieve, perform’ (Chapter 8, 8.4).","[481, 482, 483, 484, 485]"

A subgroup of assumptive knowledge verbs requires predicate negation. Among
these is khokho ‘expect, anticipate,’ which under strict polarity conditions admits
only one S-complement type. It takes khi when matrix clause shows predicate nega-
tion. Its complement must inflect for prospective Predictive.15 Even under negative
polarity, khokho fails to permit subjunctive li, conditional si or indirect question
complements.(151) ólí ómòhè í ì       khòkhó khí ólí ókpósó ló       gbè ólí ófè.

      ‘The man did not expect that the woman would kill the rat.’     Constructions with khokho limit cross clause subject identity as well as S-
complement correspondence to interrogative and substitutive pronouns. Subject
identity across matrix and embedded clause is disallowed, since complement sub-
ject rejects logophoric (yon) pronouns and takes only personal (o) pronouns.(152) ólí ómòhè í ì       khòkhó khí ó / *yón ló          gbè ólí ófè.

flect in the affirmative for neither Past and Present perfect nor imperfect Continuous
and Habitual. Relative to polarity and mood, khokho constructions fail as impera-
tives, prohibitives and polar questions, although, as already seen, khokho occurs in
negatives. Despite a propensity for negation, khokho constructions do not accept
Past Absolute negation.(154) *ólí ómòhè í yà        khòkhó khí ólí ókpósó ló        gbè ófè.

The verb noun collocation moe ìdàèhón ‘expect, anticipate’ (moe ‘have,’ ìdàèhón
expectation’) permits S-complements under conditions of negative polarity. moe
ìdàèhón takes indicative khi only if the matrix clause exhibits Perfect Negation and
complement clause aspect is prospective Predictive. Under its negative polarity
condition, moe ìdàèhón rejects subjunctive li, conditional si or indirect question
complements.(155) òjè í ì        ké mòè ìdàèhón       khí ólí ókpósó ló vàré.

subject allows only personal (o), not logophoric (yon) pronouns.(156) òjè í ì        ké mòè ìdàèhón        khí ó / *yón ló vàré.

their grammatical subject. They include mie ‘find out,’ oo ‘suppose,’ ga ze ‘discover,’
de ‘discover’ and vbohie ‘dream.’ None manifests a ditransitive form. Moreover, mie
and oo are limited to first person subjects. vbohie figures in complex predicates with
mie to modulate situational aspect of complement content. Factuality verbs are
limited to khi marked S-complements. They reject those marked by li, si or IQ. Fur-
ther, factuality verbs limit aspect to the perfect and, except for polar interrogatives,
tend to restrict polarity and mood expression. Complement types with factuality
verbs are embedded as direct objects. None but that of mie corresponds to an inter-
rogative pronoun and none corresponds to manner demonstrative pronoun ìyó ‘so.’
Overwhelmingly, factuality verbs constrain subject identity across complement and
matrix clauses by rejecting logophoric pronouns. Additional properties emerge from
consideration of each verb and its S-complements.","[871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876]"

8 Be, do, happen and have
Emai employs several copula forms to articulate grammatical functions associated
with English ‘be’ as well as various verbs to convey ‘do,’ ‘happen’ and ‘have.’ Al-
though the phonological form expressing some functions of ‘be,’ ‘do,’ and ‘happen,’
respectively, are identical, their tonal behavior and grammatical properties are dis-
tinct. The form expressing ‘have’ shows no phonological similarity to either ‘be’ or
‘do’ forms. A residual set of verb forms expressing meanings related to ‘resemble’
and ‘seem’ occupy final sections of this chapter.8.1 ‘be’ forms
Emai employs five ‘be’ forms. Two allow a speaker to re-align a referent with respect
to presumed discourse knowledge of the hearer. One form specifies referent identity
for the addressee (óò), and another equates one referent to another (khi). Remaining
‘be’ forms convey predication, assigning a referent to either a nominal class (vbi/u),
property (u) or location (ri/e).(1) a. óáìn         lí í khì àgbògbòràn.

       the youth         PRP.be LOC house

tion properties are assessed relative to mood and polarity, verb suffixes and inflec-
tion, in addition to auxiliary, preverb and postverbal categories. Noun phrase posi-
tions associated with ‘be’ forms are assessed with regard to NP type, animacy,
syntactic shape and repositioning in discourse.
424 | Be, do, happen and have8.1.1 Equational identity khiA relation of Equational Identity (EID) between two noun phrase referents is con-
veyed by copula khi. One noun phrase is positioned immediately following khi and
the other occurs in focus position marked by either positive focus li/ni or negative
focus ki. The subject position preceding khi requires the Identity subject pronoun i.(2) a. ólí ómóhé nà lí í khì ònwìmè.
       the man this PF ID be farmer
       ‘It is this man who is a farmer.’
    b. ólí ómóhé nà kí í khì ònwìmè.
       the man this NF ID be farmer
       ‘It isn't this man who is a farmer.’Each noun phrase position associated with khi is syntactically restricted. khi subject
requires Identity pronoun í. It rejects nominative pronouns (e.g. o) or the indefinite
subject pronoun (a).(3) ólí ómòhè lí í / *ó / *á khì ònwìmè.
    the man PF ID he one be farmer
    ‘It is the man who is a farmer.’Subject aside, noun phrase positions framed by Equational Identity khi require
number agreement. The focus position constituent and the post-khi constituent
must show equivalent number value (*élí íkpún lí ébín' lí í khì óáìn [the cloths R dark
PF ID be that.one] ‘That one is dark cloths’).(4) élí íkpún lí ébín' lí í khì éáìn.
    the cloth R dark PF ID be those.ones
    ‘Those are the dark cloths.’    The EID copula accepts few affixal, auxiliary, preverb or post-verbal forms nor-
mally associated with Emai verbs. khi constructions evince a predicate phrase with
nonfixed tone: low tone (khì) with bare predicate phrase, i.e. absence of inflectional,
auxiliary or preverb categories, but high tone (khí) when preceded by an auxiliary or
preverb, such as epistemic Certaintive ma.(5) a. èkpèn lí í khì ójé ísì éànmì.

     leopard PF ID CER be chief ASS animal
     ‘It is the leopard who is certainly chief of the animals.’
     ‘The chief of the animals is certainly the leopard.’     The EID copula rejects affixes typically associated with verbs. It disallows the
Perseverative prefix Ci-, Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no and Factative suffix -i. Relative
to inflection, khi constructions do not inflect for perfect, imperfect or prospective
aspect. EID constructions also limit auxiliaries. While incompatible with deontic
Hortative í, they allow epistemic Certaintive ma (òhí lí í mà khí óbá' [Ohi PF ID CER
be Oba] ‘It is ohi who surely is the King / Oba’), Dubitatives vba (òhí lí í vbà khí óbá'?
[Ohi PF ID DUB be Oba] ‘Could Ohi really be the King / Oba?’) and bia (òhí lí í bìà khí
óbá'?[Ohi PF ID DUB be Oba] ‘Is Ohi actually the King / Oba?’) as well as Concessive
rere (òhí lí í rèrè khí óbá'? [Ohi PF ID CONC be Oba] ‘So is it Ohi who is even the King
/ Oba?’). Unacceptable are epistemic Deductive za, Resultative za and Hypothetical
kha.
     EID khi is not as selective regarding relative tense. It admits Anterior ke (èkpèn lí
í kè khí ójé ísì éànmì [leopard PF ID ANT be chief ASS animal] ‘It is the leopard who
has been chief of the animals since then / The chief of the animals since then is the
leopard’) and Subsequent kpe (èkpèn lí í kpè khí ójé ísì éànmì? [leopard PF ID SUB be
chief ASS animal] ‘Is the chief of the animals still the leopard?’).
     As for preverbs, a few event-directed preverbs are grammatical in EID construc-
tions. Participant-directed preverbs, though, are disallowed (Chapter 3, 3.2.8 for
preverb types). khi constructions admit only kuku from the evaluative class (òhí lí í
kùkù khí óbá' [Ohi PF ID POEV be Oba] ‘Ohi is afterall the King / Oba’) and kpao from
the temporal class (èkpèn lí í kpàò khí ójé ísì éànmì [leopard PF ID earlier be chief
ASS animal]‘The chief of the animals initially was the leopard’).
     Negative focus and interrogative mood establish conditions for aspectualizer
preverbs Additive gbo (òhí kí í gbò khí óbá'? [Ohi NF ID ADD be Oba] ‘Isn't it also Ohi
who is King / Oba?’) and Durative se (òhí kí í sè khí óbá'? [Ohi NF ID DUR be Oba]
‘Isn't it still Ohi who is King / Oba?’). No other aspectualizers occur with EID khi,
irrespective of mood or focus type. Of preverbs remaining, manner-demonstrative,
subject attributive and quantity, none is grammatical in a khi construction.
     The EID copula is highly restricted Relative to postverbal complement particles
and adverbs. It disallows postverbal Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree
gbe (*ólí ómòhè lí í khì ònwìmè léé / gbé [the man PF ID be farmer TEMP /much] ‘It is
the man who already is a farmer / too much of a farmer’). Likewise, khi construc-
tions reject temporal deictic adverbs, e.g. èghéènà ‘just recently’ (*ólí ómòhè lí í khì
ónwímé èghéènà [the man PF ID be farmer recently] ‘It was the man who was a
farmer recently’).2
426 | Be, do, happen and have     Copula khi restricts polarity and mood. It appears as a polar question. But it re-
jects Perfect Negation (*ólí ómóhé nà lí í ì khì ònwìmè [the man this PF ID NEG be
farmer] ‘It is not this man who is a farmer’), allowing only negative focus ki. Con-
cerning mood, khi constructions never appear as imperatives or prohibitives.(6) a. ólí ómóhé nà lí í khì ònwìmè?

    b. ólí ómóhé nà kí í khì ònwìmè.
       the man this NF ID be farmer
       ‘It isn't this man who is a farmer.’    EID khi noun phrase positions exhibit contrasting grammatical properties. They
constrain NP type (pronoun < proper noun < common noun), definiteness (definite <
indefinite) and animacy (human < animate < inanimate). Regarding NP type, li/ni
focus position takes emphatic personal pronouns; nonemphatic nominative pro-
nouns are unacceptable.(7) mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn lí í khì ònwìmè.
    I           you     he   PF ID be farmer
    ‘It is I / you / he who am / are / is a farmer.’Focus position accepts most impersonal pronouns. It even accepts numeral headed
partitive phrases (èvá vbì ò lí í khì ìgbégbè [two LOC it PF ID be velvet] ‘It is two of
them that are velvet’). However, EID focus position disallows the partitive existen-
tial quantifier pronoun ósò (*ósò lí í khì ísì èmé [one PF ID be ASS my] ‘It is a certain
one that is mine’).

        velvet PF ID be all
        ‘All are velvet.’In khi’s focus position constituent, common nouns take an optional definite prede-
terminer ((ólì) èkpà lí í khì ísì òjè [the bag PF ID be ASS Oje] ‘It is a / the bag which is
Oje's’). But they reject partitive existential quantifier ósò (*ómóhé ósò lí í khì óbá' ísì
èdó [man certain PF ID be Oba ASS Edo] ‘It is a certain man who is the Oba of Be-
nin’).
    Post-khi position is more restrained with regard to NP type and definiteness but
not animacy. It allows no personal pronouns, particularly those for accusative (óì).
Equally unacceptable are nominative (ò) and emphatic (ìyòìn) pronouns.(10) *ólì ònwìmè lí í khì óì / ò / ìyòìn.
      the farmer PF ID be him he he
      ‘It is a farmer that is he.’Post-copula position limits impersonal pronouns. It admits those that are definite or
construed as definite. Demonstrative òáìn (ólí ómòhè lí í khì óáìn [the man PF ID be
that.one] ‘That is the man’) and universal quantifying èrèmé (ìgbégbè lí í khì èrèmé
[velvet PF ID be all] ‘All are velvet’) occur. Post-copula position disallows partitive
existential pronoun ósò (*ìgbégbè lí í khì ósò [velvet PF ID be certain.one] ‘Some
thing is velvet’).
    Post-khi position also rejects numeral pronouns. èvá is representative alone
(*ìgbégbè lí í khì èvá [velvet PF ID be two] ‘Two are velvet’) or as partitive vbi phrase
head (*ìgbégbè lí í khì èvá vbì ò [velvet PF ID be two LOC it] ‘Two of them are velvet’).
     khi’s post-copula position permits proper nouns, although never with emphatic
partitive òkpá.(11) ódón     mè lí í khì òlólò (*òkpá).
     husband me PF ID be Ololo alone
     ‘My husband is Ololo.’Post-khi position also allows common nouns: human (óvbékhán), animate
(àgbògbòràn) or inanimate (úgbálúhúmí). They occur bare or modified by a relative
clause with Relator li or an associative phrase with ísì.

        cloth that.kind PF ID be head.wrap ASS my
        ‘It is that kind of cloth which is my headwrap.’     Modification of the noun in post-copula position in khi constructions is partially
restricted. This position rejects partitive existential ósò (*àzén lí í khì ómóhé ósò
[wizard PF ID be man certain] ‘Some man is a wizard’). When a common noun (e.g.
èkpà ‘bag’) can be semantically construed as head of an overtly headless associative
phrase in focus position (ísì òjè), post-copula position requires the definite article
(ólì èkpà). Post-khi position under this condition does not accept bare common
nouns.(13) ísì òjè lí í khì ólì èkpà /*èkpà.
     ASS Oje PF ID be the bag    bag
     ‘The bag is Oje's.’     Noun phrase positions linked by khi are fixed with respect to discourse reposi-
tioning. Focus position noun phrases cannot be replaced by a topic noun phrase
(*ódón óì, í khì òlólò [husband her ID be Ololo] ‘As for her husband, he is Ololo’). As
well, an emphatic pronoun in khi’s focus position cannot co-refer to topic (*ódón óì,
ìyòìn lí í khì òlólò [husband her he PF ID be Ololo] ‘As for her husband, it is he who is
Ololo’).(14) ódón        óì lí í khì òlólò.
     husband her PF ID be Ololo
     ‘It is her husband that Ololo is.’    Similarly, post-copula position is constrained. It cannot correspond to a noun
phrase as topic constituent (*òlólò, ódón óì lí í khì óáìn [Ololo husband her PF ID be
that.one] ‘As for Ololo, it is that one her husband is’) or as a second focus position
(*òlólò lí ódón óì lí í khì óáìn [Ololo PF husband her PF ID be that.one] ‘It is Ololo
who is that one’s husband’).
     Noun phrase positions linked by khi exhibit distinct interrogative pronouns.
Post-khi position rejects interrogative pronouns, particularly an echo question pro-
noun (*ódón óì lí í khì óèé'? [husband her PF ID be who] ‘Her husband is who?’).

     woodpecker        woodpecker be
     ‘Woodpecker.’     ‘It is a woodpecker.’8.1.2 Specifier oThe Specifier copula (SPE) construction identifies a referent for a hearer. It exhibits
a rather rigid syntax. SPE constructions consist of Specifier copula o preceded by a
noun phrase in a focus position that is either overtly marked by negative focus ki or
covertly marked for positive focus. SPE rejects overt marking of positive focus by
li/ni. In its canonical shape, the Specifier copula shows a high low tone.(17) óì     kí óò.         / óì (*lí) óò.
     thief NF be             thief PF be
     ‘It isn't a thief.’     ‘It’s a thief.’    SPE constructions show no grammatical subject. Nominative pronouns are not
allowed either in place of initial high tone, as one might expect if the initial high
tone o were the third person nominative pronoun (*ólí ómòhè ó ò [the man he be]
430 | Be, do, happen and have‘He is a man’), or in construction with high low tone of copula óò (*ólí ómòhè í / ú óò
[the man I you be] ‘I am / you are the man’).
     SPE frames exhibit few grammatical properties typically associated with verb
constructions. óò does not inflect for aspect, at least in the usual Emai fashion. Alt-
hough the bare SPE copula shows high low tone, it disallows aspect marking as
perfect (neither Past nor Present), imperfect (neither Continuous nor Habitual) or
prospective (neither Predictive nor Anticipative).
     Constructions with óò restrict verbal affixes, auxiliaries, preverbs, postverbal
particles and temporal deictic adverbs. Relative to verbal affixes, SPE is incompati-
ble with Perseverative prefix Ci-, Distributive suffix lo/lo/no and Factative suffix -i.
     SPE copula tone is uniformly low when preceded by a modal auxiliary. And SPE
is never compatible with a subject pronoun (ó ) preceding an auxiliary.(18) íkhúnmí ékpà má ò.            /   *íkhúnmí ékpà ó má' ò.
     medicine vomit CER be               medicine vomit it CER be
     ‘It is vomit medicine.’     SPE constructions restrict auxiliaries, except for epistemic forms, and preverbs.
Relative tense ke and kpe are unacceptable as is deontic Hortative í. SPE allows
epistemic Certaintive ma, as shown above, Dubitative vba (óì vbá ò? [thief DUB be]
‘Could it really be a thief?’) and bia (íkhúnmí ékpà bíá ò? [medicine vomit DUB be]
‘Was it actually vomit medicine?’), and Concessive rere (óì rérè ó? [thief CONC be]
‘So it was even a thief?’). Of these, only Certaintive does not require a polar ques-
tion. SPE disallows Deductive za, Resultative za and Hypothetical kha.
     Specifier copula constructions limit preverbs absolutely. They reject aspectual-
izer gbo, evaluative kuku, temporal kpao and manner-demonstrative ìyó as repre-
sentatives of their category (*óì gbó / kúkù / kpáò / ìyó ò [thief ADD POEV initially
DMD be] ‘It’s also / after all / firstly / so a thief’). In addition, they reject subject
attributive and quantity preverbs
     SPE similarly constrains post-verbal complement particles and adverbials. It
disallows Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*óì óò léé / gbé [thief
be TEMP much] ‘He’s already too much a thief’). It also prohibits temporal deictic
adverbs such as éénà ‘today’ (*óì óò éènà [thief be today] ‘It’s a thief today’).
     SPE óò constructions severely limit polarity and mood. They show an interroga-
tive form with high high tone on the copula (óì óó? [thief be] ‘Is it a thief?’, óì kí óó?
[thief NF be] ‘Isn't it a thief?’). However, óò constructions do not assume an impera-
tive, prohibitive or negative statement shape.
     Specifier óò partially restricts its initial noun phrase position, i.e focus, as to NP
type, animacy and definiteness.4 For NP type, Specifier focus requires an emphatic
pronoun, irrespective of person or number. It rejects nonemphatic nominative pro-
nouns (i, u) or the indefinite subject pronoun (a).
                                                                          ‘be’ forms | 431(19) mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn óò.
     I           you     he be
     ‘It is I / you / he.’     SPE initial position allows impersonal pronouns. These include demonstrative
(óáìn, ònà, ónóì), partitive (ósò) and contrastive (óvbèé) existential quantifier, deictic
(élìyó) and contrastive (ódàn) kindred, as well as numeral pronouns, cardinal (èvá)
or collective (èvèvá), as in (óáìn / óvbèé /ósò óò [that.one another certain.one be] ‘It
is that one / another one / a certain one’). Universal quantifier pronouns differ as to
grammaticality: collective èrèmé occurs whereas distributive òdóòdé does not.(20) èrèmé / *òdóòdé       óò.
     all          each.one be
      ‘It’s all.’     SPE focus allows proper and common nouns. It permits proper nouns of person
(òhí) and place (áfúzé') but disallows proper nouns with emphatic òkpá ‘alone.’(21) òhí (*òkpá) óò.         /    áfúzé' óò.
     Ohi alone be                 Afuze be
     ‘It is Ohi.’                 ‘It is Afuze.’    Common nouns, regardless of human (ómò), animate (áwà) or inanimate (ìtébù)
nature, appear in SPE focus position and do so with an optional definite article.(22) (ólí) ómò óò.            /   (ólí) áwà óò.        /   (ólì) ìtébù óò.
      the infant be                the dog be               the table be
      ‘It’s an / the infant.’      ‘It’s a / the dog.’      ‘It’s a / the table.’     In its focus position SPE admits various postdeterminers. Besides numerals
(èvá) and kindred forms (élìyó), it allows demonstratives like áìn (ólì ìtébú áìn óò [the
table that be] ‘It’s that table’) and existential quantifiers like ósò (ómóhé ósò óò [man
certain be] ‘It is a certain man’. Relative to universal quantifiers, SPE focus accepts
collective èrèmé but not distributive òdóòdé (ívbékhán èrèmé / *òdóòdé óò [youths
all each be] ‘It’s all the youths’).
     Noun phrases in SPE constructions disallow further repositioning in discourse.
They disallow a noun phrase in topic position with a corresponding pronominal
anaphor in focus position (*ólí ómòhè, ìyòìn óò [the man he be] ‘As for the man, it is
he’). As well, SPE óò does not accept interrogative pronouns such as émé', óé', ékà
(*émé' / óé' / ékà óò? [what who how.much be] ‘What / Who / How much is it?’).
432 | Be, do, happen and have    Although SPE constructions with óò answer a wide range of information ques-
tions,5 they do not appear as information questions. Instead, an u form, found in
property copula and class membership copula constructions, shapes information
questions for which SPE constructions serve as responses. Information questions
with u accept interrogative pronouns for person (óé'), object (émé') and quantity
(éká) but not place (ébé').(23) óé' ó ú'?     /       émé' ó ú'?           /    éká           ó ú'?
     who it PAP.be         what it PAP.be            how.much it PAP.be

     ‘It’s Oje.’           ‘It’s a cutlass.’          ‘It’s four naira.’     The entire SPE construction in complex topic-comment structures designates a
comment relative to a preceding topic constituent (e.g. ólí ómòhè). Although the SPE
construction follows a noun phrase in topic position, the topic noun phrase corre-
sponds to no pronoun marked for a grammatical relation in the SPE construction, as
is the case in simple topic constructions.(24) ólí ómòhè, òjè óò.
     the man      chief be
     ‘As for the man, he’s the traditional ruler.’SPE constructions also serve as comment for a morphosyntactically heavy topic that
is extraposed and marked by indicative complement khi. The entire topic comment
configuration shows only a polar interrogative mood.(25) àtà óó khì òjè gbé               ákhè á?
     true be IND Oje PRP.break pot CS
     ‘Is it true that Oje broke a pot?’8.1.3 Nominal class membership vbi / uThe complementary copula forms vbi and u articulate class membership (CMB).
They assign a referent to a nominal class. Canonical CMB constructions define two
noun phrase positions: the assigned nominal precedes the class nominal with the
copula interposed. The overall syntactic shape of CMB constructions is constrained,
particularly with respect to noun phrase composition and copula verbal properties.
                                                                      ‘be’ forms | 433    CMB constructions rarely exhibit a canonical simple active, affirmative frame.
Instead, they show either Perfect Negation preceding copula vbi or a class noun in a
discourse defined position such as focus (marked by li/ni) followed by the assigned
nominal and copula u.(26) a. ólí ómòhè í ì            vbì óì.
        the man SC NEG be thief
        ‘The man is not a thief.’
     b. óì      lí ólí ómóhé ú'.
        thief PF the man PAP.be
        ‘It is a thief that the man is.’Despite their class membership function, CMB constructions never frame taxonomic
statements in which one referent is ranked relative to another using a specific to
general scale, respectively.(27) *èkpèn / ólì èkpèn         vbì éàmì.
      leopard the leopard be animal
      ‘A / The leopard is an animal.’    As previously indicated, CMB constructions limit polarity and mood. Negative
polarity is the norm. Under extremely rich contextual conditions but never at the
onset of a discourse, affirmative CMB constructions occur. When they do, vbi tone is
obligatorily low.(28) ólí ómòhè vbì óì.
     the man be thief
     ‘The man is a thief.’     CMB constructions partially limit mood expression. They appear as polar ques-
tions with Perfect Negation (ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óì? [the man SC NEG be thief] ‘Isn't the
man a thief?’) and focus (óì lí ólí ómóhé ù? [thief PF the man be] ‘Is it a thief that the
man is?’). CMB does not occur as an imperative or prohibitive.
     CMB accepts few forms prototypically associated with Emai verb phrases. It lim-
its verbal affixes, inflection, auxiliaries, preverbs, post-verbal particles and tem-
poral deictic adjuncts. Although CMB prefers negation, it does not inflect for perfect,
imperfect or prospective aspect. Likewise, it rejects verbal affixes, such as Distribu-
tive lo/lo/no (*élí ímòhè í ì vbì-lò óì [the men SC NEG be-DS thief] ‘Each of the men is
not a thief’).
     Similarly, CMB frames restrict auxiliaries and preverbs. They disallow modality,
both deontic (Hortative í) and epistemic (Certaintive ma), as well as relative tense,
434 | Be, do, happen and haveAnterior ke in (*ólí ómòhè í ì í / má / ké vbì óì [the man SC NEG HOR CER ANT be
thief] ‘The man should not be/ is surely not / is not since then a thief’). Under spe-
cial usage conditions involving fixed metaphor, the vbi copula occurs with Anterior
relative tense ke (áwé ísì òí í ì ké vbì égbé ísì òí [legs ASS her SC NEG ANT be body
ASS her] ‘Her legs do not feel part of her body anymore’).
     CMB constructions allow only one preverb. They accept evaluative preverb kuku
(ólí úkpùn í ì kùkú vbì ísì òjè [the cloth SC NEG POEV be ASS Oje] ‘Afterall, the cloth is
not Oje's’). Remaining preverb classes are rejected, namely aspectualizer (Additive
gbo), subject attributive (totóbo), temporal (kpao), manner-demonstrative (ìyó) and
quantity (gba): (*élí ímòhè í ì gbó / tòtóbó / kpàó / ìyó / gbá vbì óì [the men SC NEG
ADD / intensely /initially / DMD /COL be thief] ‘The men are not also / intensely /
initially / that way / together thieves’).
     CMB also restricts postverbal temporal particles and adverbs. It rejects Tem-
poral Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí lèé / gbè [the
man SC NEG be thief TEMP / much] ‘The man is not a thief already / too much of a
thief’). It disallows deictic adjuncts, e.g. èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí
èghéènà [the man SC NEG be thief recently] ‘The man was not a thief recently’).
     Noun phrase positions in CBM constructions are restricted by NP type and defi-
niteness but not animacy or number. Assigned nominals preceding the CMB copula
allow all NP types and all definiteness values. The class nominal following vbi/u
accepts only common nouns and only referential indefinites. Across assigned nomi-
nal and class nominal positions, number agreement is obligatory (ólí ómòhè and
ònwìmè, élí ímòhè and ìnwìmè).(29) a. ólí ómòhè / *élí ímòhè í ì   vbì ònwìmè.
        the man       the men SC NEG be farmer

        the men      the man SC NEG be farmers
       ‘The men are not farmers.’Class nominal position following vbi/u allows common nouns that are human

       the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass
       ‘The heavy one is not a cutlass.’Some common nouns appear in CMB class position only when syntactically elabo-
rated. Abstract nouns like èmòì ‘fault’ require a possessive modifier.(31) ó ì        vbì émóí mè / *èmòì.
     it NEG be fault my        fault
     ‘It is not my fault.’Class nominal position following CMB disallows proper names and personal pro-
nouns, particularly nominative (ò) or accusative (óì) pronouns.(32) *ólí óbò       í   ì     vbì òlólò / ò / óì.
      the oraclist SC NEG be Ololo he him
      ‘The oraclist is not Ololo / he / him.’     Class nominal position constrains definiteness expression. Common nouns with
definite article ólí/élí are unacceptable (ónóì í ì vbì ómò / *ólí ómò [next.one SC NEG
be child the child] ‘The next one is not a useless child’), as are attributive phrase
descriptions marked by the same modifier (*ólí ékpé' í ì vbì ólí óbín' [the hawk SC
NEG be the dark.one] ‘The hawk is not the dark one’).
     Class position with vbi/u disallows the entire range of postdeterminers. Unac-
ceptable modifiers in class position include kindred élìyó and demonstrative nóì
(*ólí òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá élìyó / nóì [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass that.kind / next]
‘The heavy one is not that kind of cutlass’), universal quantifier èrèmé and cardinal
numeral èvá (*élì òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá èrèmé / èvá [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass all
two] ‘The heavy ones are not all the / the two cutlasses’) as well as existential quan-
tifier ósò (*ólí òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá ósò [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass some] ‘The
heavy one is not some cutlass’).
     However, CMB class position takes common nouns modified by Associative ísì
phrases. It does so provided there is no definite article (ólì òkhùà í ì vbì ópíá ísì òjè
/*ólí ópíá ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass ASS Oje the cutlass ASS Oje] ‘The
heavy one is not Oje's cutlass’). It also accepts headless associative phrases (ólì
òkhùà í ì vbì ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The heavy one is not Oje's’).
     CMB class position accepts few impersonal pronouns. It allows the numeral
pronoun úkpòkpá ‘one’ as head of a partitive vbi phrase whose complement is a
pronominally headed relative clause. A numeral pronoun greater than one (e.g. èvá)
as head of a partitive phrase is unacceptable (*élí ópíá nà í ì vbì èvá vbí élí á ló shèn-
nò [the cutlass these SC NEG be two LOC ones one PRED sell-DS] ‘These cutlasses are
436 | Be, do, happen and havenot two of the ones that will be sold’). All other impersonal pronouns are rejected:
demonstrative, universal and existential quantifier, kindred and collective numeral.(33) ólí ópíá nà í ì             vbì úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló         shèn.
     the cutlass this SC NEG be one             LOC ones one PRED sell
      ‘This cutlass is not one of the ones that will be sold.’    Assigned position preceding the CMB copula exhibits contrasting values as to
NP type and definiteness but not animacy. Regarding NP type, it accepts proper
names (òlólò) and subject position pronouns (má, yán) but not the indefinite subject
pronoun (a).(34) a. òlólò í ì        vbì óì.
        Ololo SC NEG be thief

     b. má / yán / *á        ì   vbì óì.
        we they one NEG be thief
        ‘We / they are not thieves.’    Assigned position in vbi/u constructions accepts common nouns regardless of
animacy. They must, however, be syntactically elaborated.7 Assigned position per-
mits human (òkpòsò), nonhuman animate (áwá) and inanimate (ópìà) nouns, pro-
vided each is elaborated by, for example, definite article ólì.(35) a. ólì òkpòsò / *òkpòsò í ì            vbì óèjè.

and any other modifier.(36) úkhùè / *ólí úkhùè / *úkhùè lí òdè        í ì    vbì émí lì èsèn.

predeterminer. Common nouns occur in assigned position when modified only by a
collective numeral, e.g. èvèvá in (ímóhé èvèvá í ì vbì ìnwìmè [men both SC NEG be
farmers] ‘Both men are not farmers’). Assigned position common nouns do not re-
quire the definite article when modified by Associative ísì (ólí áwà / áwá ísì òjè í ì vbì
áànmì [the dog dog ASS Oje SC NEG be female] ‘The dog of Oje / Oje’s dog is not
female’) or Relator li relative clause (ólí ópíá / ópíá lí ólí ómóhé nwú' fì á í ì vbì ísì òjè
[the cutlass cutlass R the man take propel CS SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The / A cutlass
that the man threw away was not Oje's’).
      Other modifiers that affect referent construal appear in assigned position. These
include postdeterminer demonstratives nà and nóì (ólí ópíá nà / ópíá nóì í ì vbì ólí á
ré' gbé ólí éwè [the cutlass this cutlass next SC NEG be one one use kill the goat]
‘This cutlass / The next cutlass is not the one used to kill the goat’).
      More constrained in assigned position are cardinal numerals and quantifier
postdeterminers. Cardinal numerals require the definite predeterminer (élí ópìà èvá
/ *ópìà èvá í ì vbì ísì òjè [the cutlass two cutlass two SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The two
cutlasses are not Oje's’) or a complement consisting of a partitive vbi phrase (ópìà
èvá vbì ò í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass two LOC it SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘Two cutlasses from
them were not Oje's’).
      Assigned position rejects quantifier and kindred forms. Excluded are existential
quantifiers ósò and óvbèé (*ópíá ósò / óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass some other SC NEG
be ASS Oje] ‘Some / Another cutlass is not Oje’s’) and kindred élìyó (*ópíá élìyó í ì vbì
ísì òjè [cutlass that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘A cutlass of that kind is not Oje's’).
      Impersonal pronouns in assigned position are partially restricted. Acceptable
are demonstrative ònà and ónóì (ònà / ónóì í ì vbì ísì èé [this.one next.one SC NEG be
ASS your] ‘This one / the next one is not yours’) as well as plural existential ésò (ésò
í ì vbì ísì èmé [some.ones SC NEG be ASS my] ‘None are mine’).
      In assigned position, numeral pronouns reveal a mixed distribution. Collective
numeral pronouns (èvèvá) are acceptable (èvèvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [all.two SC NEG be
ASS my] ‘Both are not mine’), whereas cardinal numeral pronouns (èvá, òkpá) re-
quire a following partitive vbi phrase (èvá vbí élì ògèdè / *èvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [two LOC
the banana two SC NEG be ASS my] ‘Two of the bananas are not mine’). Morphologi-
cal reformulation is also required for òkpá ‘one,’ e.g. úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló
shèn í ì vbì ísì òjè [one LOC ones one PRED sell SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘One of those that
will be sold is not Oje’s’).
      Nonetheless, assigned position reveals the unacceptability of remaining pro-
nouns. Kindred forms fail, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn (*élìyó í ì vbì ísì òjè
[that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘That kind of one is not Oje’s’), as does the contrastive
existential pronoun óvbèé (*óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [other.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘An-
other one is not Oje’s’).
438 | Be, do, happen and have    Nominal constituents in CMB constructions partially constrain discourse reposi-
tioning. Assigned position corresponds to a constituent in li/ni focus position or in
topic position.(37) a. ólí ómòhè òkpà lí ó ì           vbì óì.

     ‘It is a thief that the man is.’    Copula vbi/u information questions are confined to Perfect Negation. The as-
signed position corresponds to an interrogative pronoun (óé') in question position.
Moreover, only when the interrogative contains a vbi phrase with partitive signifi-
cance (vbí úsèé vbá) is the assigned position queried (*óé' ó ì vbì óì? [who he NEG be
thief] ‘Who is not a thief?’). Class position is never queried in a grammatical struc-
ture (*óé' ólí ómóhé vbì? [who the man be] ‘Who is the man?’).(39) óé' ó ì     vbì óí    vbí úsèé vbá?

     ‘Who among you is not a thief?’    Additional conditions govern the shape of CMB constructions. Relative to pre-
copula assigned position, embedded indicative complements marked by comple-
mentizer khi must be extraposed (*khì òjè gbé ákhè á í ì vbì àtà [IND chief PRP.break
pot CS SC NEG be true] ‘That a chief broke a pot is not true’). The expletive pronoun

     ‘Telling lies is not a good thing.’8.1.4 Property uThe copula form u assigns a nominal referent to a property. u occurs in construction
with a preceding noun phrase and a following adjective or property noun. Although
the position preceding u manifests characteristics typical of grammatical subject,
and the property term consists primarily of adjectives,8 the property construction
(PRY) attracts relatively few features prototypically associated with verb phrases.(42) ólí ómòhè ú        négénégén.
     the man PRP.be wiry
     ‘The man is wiry.’    PRY constructions constrain mood expression more than polarity. They are
found as polar questions (ólí émá ú' kéré? [the yam PRP.be small] ‘Is the yam
small?’) and negative statements (ólí émà í ì ù kéré [the yam SC NEG be small] ‘The
yam is not small’). However, they never appear as imperatives or prohibitives.
    PRY frames constrain inflection, auxiliary and preverb categories. They inflect
for Present and Past perfect, imperfect Habitual and prospective Predictive. They
never appear in imperfect Continuous or prospective Anticipative.(43) a. ólì èkpèn ú          / ólí ékpén ú'        nwènénwèné.

        the yam PRED be small
        ‘The yam will be small.’     PRY u allows some modality and relative tense categories. It accepts all epistem-
ic forms (ólí émá má' ú kéré [the yam PAP.CER be small] ‘The yam surely is small’, ólí
émá khà ú kéré [the yam PAP.HYP be small] ‘The yam would have been small’) ex-
cept rational judgment Deductive za and Resultative za. A polar interrogative con-
struction is required for Concessive rere (ólí émá ré'rè ú kéré? [the yam PAP.CONC be
small] ‘Is the yam even small?’) as well as Dubitatives bia (ólí émá bíá' ú kéré? [the
440 | Be, do, happen and haveyam PAP.DUB be small] ‘Was the yam actually small?’) and vba (ólí émá vbá' ú kéré?
[the yam PAP.DUB be small] ‘Could the yam really be small?’). PRY rejects deontic
Hortative í. As for relative tense, PRY u disallows Anterior ke but permits Subse-
quent kpe (ólí émá kpé' ú kéré [the yam PAP.SUB be small] ‘The yam is yet small
despite pending conditions’).
     In PRY constructions preverbs are extremely restricted. One finds phasal aspec-
tualizer gbo (ólí émá gbó' ú kéré [the yam PAP.ADD be small] ‘The yam is small too’),
che (ólí émà chéè ú kéré (vbí éó mè) [the yam PRP.REP be small LOC face my] ‘The
yam is again small to my eyes’), ghe (ólí émà ghéè ú kéré (vbí éó mè) [the yam
PRP.PCT be small LOC face my] ‘The yam is just small to my eyes’), and se (ólí éwé
sé' ú kéré [the goat PAP.DUR be small] ‘The goat continues to be small’). Ungram-
matical are boundary aspectualizers: Conative òó, Ingressive ya, and Egressive mo.
     PRY u accepts none of the remaining preverb classes. Rejected are all members
of the classes evaluative (kuku), temporal (kpao), manner-demonstrative (ìyó), sub-
ject attributive (dégbe) and quantity (zemi): *ólí ómóhé kú'kù / kpá'ò / íyó' / dé'gbè /
zé'mì ú négénnégén [the man PAP.POEV initially DMD steadily ABSI be wiry] ‘The
man afterall / initially / that way / steadily / is wiry’.
     In addition, PRY constructions do not allow affixal categories, postverbal tem-
poral particles or temporal adverbs typically associated with verbs. PRY rejects Per-
severative prefix (Ci), Factative (-i) and Distributive (-lo/lo/no): *élí ímóhé ú-ló'
khúíéé [the men PAP.be-DS slim] ‘Each of the men is slim.’ PRY u also rejects Tem-
poral Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*ólí ómóhé ú' négénégén léé / gbé
[the man PAP.be wiry TEMP much] ‘The man is already / far too wiry’) in addition to
deictic temporal adjuncts such as èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí ómò ú khúíéé èghéènà [the
child PRP.be slim recently] ‘The child was recently slim’).
     PRY u minimally constrains associated grammatical relations. The nominal po-
sition preceding u expresses the grammatical relation subject. It takes personal
pronouns in the nominative (o, yan); it rejects indefinite subject pronoun (a).(44) ó / yán / *á       ú'       nwènénwèné.
     it they one PAP.be spotted
     ‘It is / They are spotted.’    PRY subject position is not uniquely constrained as to NP type, animacy or defi-
niteness. For NP type, subject position permits proper names.(45) òhí ú'       khúíéé.
     Ohi PAP.be slim
     ‘Ohi was slim.’

animate ófè, inanimate úkpóràn). Each, though, must be syntactically elaborated,
by the definite article for example.(46) a. ólí ómò / *ómò        ú     kpéké.

Habitual aspect.(47) ékpén ó ò ú nwènénwèné.
     leopard SC H be spotted
     ‘Leopards are spotted.’     Subject position in PRY constructions permits a range of postdeterminers. It ac-
cepts demonstratives such as nà and nóì (óókhó nóì / ólí óókhó nà ú nwènénwèné
[chicken next the chicken this PRP.be spotted] ‘The next chicken / this chicken is
spotted’), existential quantifiers, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (óókhó ósò /
óvbèé ú nwènénwèné [chicken certain another PRP.be spotted] ‘A certain / Another
chicken is spotted’), as well as universal quantifier èrèmé and numerals such as
collective èvèvá and cardinal èvá (éókhó èrèmé / èvèvá / èvá ú' nwènénwèné [chick-
ens all both two PAP.be spotted] ‘All / both / two chickens are spotted’). Only kin-
dreds (deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn) are unacceptable.
     PRY subject position minimally restricts impersonal pronouns.9 It permits pro-
nouns for demonstrative (óáìn), universal quantifier (èrèmé), partitive and contras-
tive existential quantifier (ósò, óvbèé) in (óáìn / óvbèé / ósò / èrèmé ú' nwènénwèné
[that.one other.one some all PAP.be spotted] ‘That one is/ Another is / Some are /
All are spotted’). Numerals (collective èvèvá, cardinal èvá), too, are acceptable (èvá /
èvèvá / èvá vbí íyáín ú' nwènénwèné [two both two LOC them PAP.be spotted] ‘Two /
both / two of them are spotted’). However, PRY subject prohibits kindred pronouns
(deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn).
     In PRY constructions , discourse repositioning of assigned and property constit-
uents is constrained asymmetrically.10 Subject position corresponds to a constituent
in focus or topic position.

     b. ólí émà, ó ú'           kéré.
        the yam it PAP.be small
        ‘As for the yam, it is small.’The property term position following u, however, never corresponds to focus posi-
tion (*négénégén lí ólí ómóhé ú' [wiry PF the man PAP.be] ‘It is wiry that the man is’)
or topic position (*négénégén, ólí ómòhè ú [wiry the man PRP.be] ‘A wiry character is
what the man is’).
     PRY and its constituents correspond to two information question types. Subject
corresponds to a question with sortal significance framed by émé' and distal demon-
strative áìn. émé' alone is insufficient. As a response, a bare noun in a Specifier cop-
ula óò construction is required. A PRY clause as response is unacceptable. No other
interrogative pronoun (e.g. óé' ‘who’ or ékà ‘how many’) queries PRY subject.(49) émé' ó ú'         nwènénwèné áìn?

noun ébé', Manner preverb i and verb ri ‘be located.’ In response, a PRY construc-
tion with property term in situ is acceptable. A specifier copula óò answer is not.(50) ébé' ólí ómóhé í'           ríì?

framed by the complementary predicates ri and e. Each is followed by a preposition-
al phrase headed by vbi: NP ri vbi NP, NP e vbi NP. Concerning their distribution, ri
                                                                    ‘be’ forms | 443appears under realis conditions, e.g. affirmative declarative in the perfect, and e
under irrealis conditions, e.g. imperfect and prospective aspect, negation and deon-
tic modality.
     LCT with ri and e differ in polarity and mood potential. e but not ri accepts Per-
fect Negation. Neither construction displays an imperative or prohibitive shape.(51) ólì òkpòsò í ì        è / *rì    vbí ìwè.

        ‘Isn't the woman in the house?’    LCT constructions with ri and e show complementary inflection, auxiliaries and
preverbs. Aspect is expressed tonally in an irregular fashion. For Past perfect, ri
shows low tone and right edge high tone subject. For Present perfect, ri shows high
low tone and right edge low tone subject. Under conditions typical for Past and
Present perfect, ri would have shown, respectively, downstepped high (rí') and a
simple high (rí) tone (*ólí ókpósó rí' / ólì òkpòsò rí vbì èkìn [the woman be / the wom-

should be in the house’) and epistemic Hypothetical kha (ólí ókpósó khà é vbì ìwè

and Certaintive ma (ólí ókpósó má' rì vbí ìwè [the woman PAP.CER be LOC house]
‘The woman surely was in the house’). Neither LCT predicate permits Concessive
rere or Resultative za.
     LCT predications restrict relative tense. ri admits Subsequent kpe (ólì òkpòsò kpé
rì / *é vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.SUB be be LOC house] ‘The woman was yet in the
house despite upcoming events’), whereas e permits neither relative tense Subse-
quent kpe nor Anterior ke.
     LCT imposes strong restrictions on preverbs. ri allows aspectualizers Durative se
(ólì òkpòsò séè rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.DUR be LOC house] ‘The woman contin-
ues to be in the house’) and Past Absolute mo (ólí ókpósó mó' rì vbí ìwè [the woman
PAP.PA be LOC house] ‘The woman at one time was in the house’).
     e permits Past Absolute ya but only in polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó yà é vbí
íwé élá ódíánmì? [the woman PAP.PA be LOC house past afternoon] ‘Did the woman
used to be at home in the afternoons?’). No other aspectualizers are acceptable with
either LCT verb.
     LCT constructions reject all remaining preverb classes: evaluative (e.g. kuku),
temporal (e.g. kpao), subject attributive (e.g. dégbe), manner-demonstrative (e.g.
ìyó) and quantity (e.g. dobo óì), as shown in *ólì òkpòsò kúkù / kpáò / dégbè / íyó' /
dóbó óì rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.POEV initially steadily DMD REFL her be LOC
house] ‘The woman after all / initially / steadily / that way / by herself is in the

     In LCT constructions verb affixes, postverbal temporal particles and temporal
adjuncts are restricted. Relative to postverbal particles, ri with high low tone admits
Temporal Perspective lee but disallows Temporal Degree gbe (ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí

     Each LCT form allows temporal adjuncts consistent with its realis/irrealis char-
acter. ri with high low tone accepts ènyáà ‘just now’ (ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí ékín ènyáà
[the youth PRP.be LOC market just.now] ‘The youth is in the market right now’),
which otherwise occurs with Continuous and Anticipative, and e allows éènà ‘today’

will be in the market today’) and ákhò ‘tomorrow’ (ólí óvbékhán ló è vbí ékín ákhò
[the youth PRED be LOC market tomorrow] ‘The youth will be in the market tomor-
row’). Neither LCT predicate allows any other deictic adjunct, in particular òdè ‘yes-
terday’ (*ólí óvbékhán rì vbí ékín òdè [the youth PAP.be LOC market yesterday] ‘The
youth was in the market yesterday’) and èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí ékín

or Distributive -lo/lo/no : *élí íkpósó rì-lò / é-ló' vbì ìwè [the women PAP.be-DS be-DS
LOC house] ‘The women are in the house’.
     LCT noun phrases contrast regarding NP type, animacy and syntax. Similar
constraints affect ri and e. The initial noun phrase in LCT constructions has few
restrictions. It shows subject position properties. The noun phrase preceding ri ac-
cepts nominative pronouns, not emphatic pronouns or indefinite subject pronoun a.
It disallows deictic locative pronouns (e.g. ááìn ‘there’).(55) ì / mà / *mèmè /*à      ríì   vbí ìwè.

     Noun phrase complements of vbi in LCT ri/e constructions reveal place subcate-

     LCT nominal repositioning in discourse is asymmetrical. Complements of vbi are
more restricted than are subjects. Subjects corefer to a noun phrase in either focus
or topic position. Assuming appropriate realis/irrealis marking, ri/e subject corre-
sponds to a li/ni focus or a topic constituent.(68) a. ólì òkpòsò òkpá lí ó rì            (*ríì)   vbí ìwè.

"3.1.3.2.1 Rational judgment za, za
Form za expresses contrasting and mutually exclusive functions within the rational
judgment type. Deductive (DED) za specifies absolute certainty about proposition
truth value gained solely through logical calculation or logical inference. It appears
with perfect and imperfect aspect but not prospective aspect. In Present perfect, za
shows high low tone and follows a subject phrase with right edge low (ólí ómòhè).(20) ólí ómòhè záà       é ólí émàè.

     the man SC C DED eat the food
     ‘The man must be eating the food.’With the right edge high tone subject of Past perfect, za specifies a Resultative (RES)

     the man SC H RES beat the youth
     ‘As a result / So, the man beats the youth.’3.1.3.2.2 Speculative judgment ma, vba, bia
A speculative epistemic judgment about proposition truth value is expressed by ma,
vba and bia. Speculatives are mutually exclusive. In contrast to rational judgment
forms, speculatives convey a single function under varying tonal conditions.
    Certaintive judgment ma ‘certainly, surely’ appears with perfect, imperfect and
prospective aspect. It expresses a judgment of confidence in proposition truth de-
spite immediate circumstances that suggest otherwise. ma thus recognizes a dis-
crepancy between knowledge states of speaker and addressee. The Certaintive ap-
pears in perfect aspect: ma with high tone and a right edge high subject (ólí ómóhé)
in Past perfect, and ma with high low contour tone and right edge low subject (ólí
ómòhè) in Present perfect.(24) a. ólí ómóhé má'         é ólí émàè.

appearing in affirmative declaratives.

        ‘Did the mani really say that hei will come?’
        (What do you know that we don't?)Of the two, Dubitative vba expresses a smaller measure of doubt about proposition
truth. It appears in Past perfect (right edge high tone subject) and Present perfect
(right edge low subject). vba accepts neither imperfect nor prospective aspect.(27) a. ólí ómóhé vbá'        é ólí émàè?

        the man PRP.DUB eat the food
        ‘Could the man really have eaten the food?’Compared to vba, Dubitative bia expresses greater doubt about proposition truth.
Dubitative bia, too, is limited to interrogative structures. It is found with Past and
Present perfect, its tone affected accordingly.(28) a. ólí ómóhé bíá'        é ólí émàè?
        the man PAP.DUB eat the food

admit either imperfect.(29) ólí ómóhé ló      bìà é ólí émàè?
     the man PRED DUB eat the food
     ‘Will the man actually eat the food?’    Dubitatives exhibit two additional properties. Compared to negative statements,
bia and vba use can represent a greater challenge to addressee authority when they
occur in certain rhetorical question shapes. When rhetorical bia or vba questions in
110 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsPast perfect are directed to an elder, they convey rudeness that a simple negative
statement (í ì èèn ‘I didn’t know’) does not.(30) a. í bíá'       èén?

        ‘Could I possibly have known? How could I have known?’There is no similar effect when dubitatives occur in the Present perfect, which ex-
hibits a clause final low high tone pattern.(31) ólí ómòhè vbáà        é ólí émàèé?
     the man PRP.DUB eat the food
     ‘The man couldn't really have eaten the food, could he?’In addition, only Dubitative vba occurs with Disjunctive conjunct da ‘or’ in interrog-
ative structures (Chapter 14, 14.8.3). The level of doubt associated with Dubitative
bia is too strong for disjunctive constructions.(32) dá ólí ómóhé vbá' / *bíá' é ólí émàè?
     DIS the man PAP.DUB DUB eat the food
     ‘Or could the man really have eaten the food?’3.1.3.2.3 Assumptive judgment rere, kha
Assumptives convey concessive or hypothetical/counterfactual judgments. Conces-
sive expresses speaker assumption that a proposition is true, despite immediate
conditions to the contrary. As reduplicated rere or simple re, the Concessive allows
Past perfect (right edge high tone subject).(33) a. ólí ómóhé ré'rè / ré'          é ólí émàè.

truth value is counter to proposition truth value. Proposition truth stands in a hypo-
thetical relation to actual truth. Low tone Hypothetical kha in simple clauses allows

     ‘Would the man have even eaten the food?’3.1.3.2.4 Co-occurrence of epistemic auxiliaries
Epistemic exponents combine in the order rational, speculative, assumptive, alt-
hough not all members of each type co-occur. Rational judgment Deductive za never
combines with either speculative Dubitative (bia or vba) or assumptive Concessive
rere. Even more restricted is rational judgment Resultative za, which fails with all
epistemics. Rational Deductive za, speculative ma and assumptive rere co-occur.(37) ólí ómòhè záà       mà rérè é émàè léé.
     the man PRP.DED CER CONC eat food TEMP
     ‘Even the man must have certainly eaten food already.’When only two subclasses combine, rational precedes speculative or assumptive,
and speculative precedes assumptive. Rational judgment Deductive za precedes
speculative Certaintive ma.(38) ólí ómòhè záà       mà é ólí émàè léé.
     the man PRP.DED CER eat the food TEMP

        the man PRP.DUB CONC eat the food
        ‘Could the man really have even eaten the food?’3.1.3.2.5 Epistemic modality, mood and polarity
Epistemic auxiliaries as a class exhibit asymmetry concerning sentence mood and
polarity. Among epistemic forms, only speculative ma appears in imperative con-
structions. No other speculative, rational or assumptive form is found in prohibitive
constructions.(41) mà é ólí émàè.
     CER eat the food
     ‘Surely eat the food.’Epistemic types reveal additional asymmetry in polar interrogatives. Rational judg-
ment za in its Deductive or Resultative function fails in polar questions. Each specu-
lative form occurs in polar questions; and as indicated earlier, dubitatives require
an interrogative construction. Certaintive ma in Present perfect appears in polar
questions. Assumptive rere and kha are each found in polar questions, although the
former requires Present perfect and the latter Past perfect inflection.(42) a. ólí ómòhè máà        é ólí émàè?
        the man PRP.CER eat the food

Rational judgment za in its Deductive function co-occurs with Perfect Negation but
does so only in a polar interrogative. Resultative za rejects negation. From the spec-
ulative subclass, only ma appears with Perfect Negation, dubitatives do not. And
assumptive kha combines with Perfect Negation, whereas rere does not.(43) a. ólí ómòhè í ì       zá è ólí émàè?

        the man SC NEG HYP eat the food
        ‘The man would not have eaten the food (but he did).’3.1.4 Relative tense ke, kpeRelative tense forms are Anterior ke and Subsequent kpe. They identify a temporal
reference point that locates an event on the time axis relative to a reference time,
which may not be the moment of utterance. ke and kpe are mutually exclusive. In
multi-clause frames, each indicates clause subordination (Chapter 14, 14.3.1.)(44) a. ólí ómóhé ké'         é ólí émàè.
        the man PAP.ANT eat the food
        ‘The man ate the food afterward.’
     b. ólí ómóhé kpé'        é ólí émàè.
        the man PAP.SUB eat the food
        ‘Despite pending conditions, the man still / yet ate the food.’    Relative tense auxiliaries restrain expression of aspect and other auxiliaries. In
simple transitives, each relative tense auxiliary occurs only with Past perfect. With
imperfect aspect, only Subsequent is acceptable.
    Anterior ke assumes a reference point event temporally anterior to verb event. It
translates ‘afterwhile, afterward, anymore.’(45) ólí ómóhé ké'          é ólí émàè.
     the man PAP.ANT eat the food

prospective aspect.(46) ólí ómóhé ké'        é émà.

     the man PAP.SUB eat the food
     ‘The man yet / still ate the food (despite pending events).’In monotransitive clauses, kpe accepts Past perfect, Continuous and Habitual as
well as Predictive and Anticipative. It disallows Present perfect.(48) a. ólí ómóhé kpé'          é ólí émàè.

As a class, relative tense auxiliaries partially constrain sentence mood and polarity.
Neither occurs in imperatives. Only ke appears in prohibitives.(49) é   è kè é ólí émàè.

    ‘Don't eat the food anymore.’

        the man SC NEG SUB eat the food
        ‘The man did not yet eat the food.’3.1.4.2 Relative tense and auxiliary co-occurrence
Relative tense auxiliary forms exhibit skewed distribution relative to deontic and
epistemic modality. Each fails with deontic modality Hortative í. Anterior ke and
Subsequent kpe reveal nonuniform distribution vis-à-vis epistemic modality and its
three judgment types. Neither combines with rational judgment Deductive za. Ante-
rior and Subsequent precede Resultative za, although it is less natural for Resulta-
tive za to precede relative tense ke (ólí ómóhé ké' zà é ólí émàè [the man PAP.ANT
RES eat the food] ‘The man as a result ate the food afterward’) compared to (ólí
ómóhé zá' kè é ólí émàè [the man PAP.RES ANT eat the food] ‘As a result the man
afterward ate the food’) or kpe (ólí ómóhé kpé' zà é ólí émàè [the man PAP.SUB RES
eat the food] ‘The man as a result yet ate the food’) vis-à-vis (ólí ómóhé zá' kpè é ólí
émàè [the man PAP.RES SUB eat the food] ‘As a result the man yet ate the food’).
     Relative tense ke and kpe reveal similar distribution with respect to speculative
judgment forms. Both occur with each of the speculative forms ma, vba and bia,
although combinations involving ke exhibit greater perfect aspect flexibility and
less sentence mood variation. In polar interrogatives, Anterior ke follows Certaintive
ma, (ólí ómóhé má' kè é ólí émàè? [the man PAP.CER ANT eat the food] ‘Did the man
surely afterward eat the food?’) and (ólí ómòhè máà kè é ólí émàè? [the man PRP.CER
ANT eat the food] ‘Did the man surely afterward eat the food?’), as well as Dubita-
tives vba (ólí ómóhé vbá' kè é ólí émàè? [the man PAP.DUB ANT eat the food] ‘Could
the man really eat the food afterward?’, ólí ómòhè vbáà kè é ólí émàèé? [the man
PRP.DUB ANT eat the food] ‘The man couldn't really have eaten the food afterward,
116 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbscould he?’), and bia (ólí ómóhé bíá' kè é ólí émàè? [the man PAP.DUB ANT eat the
food] ‘Did the man actually eat the food afterward?’, ólí ómòhè bíà kè é ólí émàè?
[the man PRP.DUB ANT eat the food] ‘Has the man actually eaten the food after-
ward?’).
     Subsequent kpe in declaratives follows Certaintive ma (ólí ómóhé má' kpè é ólí
émàè [the man PAP.CER SUB eat the food] ‘The man surely yet ate the food’) and in
polar interrogatives it follows Dubitatives vba (ólí ómóhé vbá' kpè é ólí émàè? [the
man PAP.DUB SUB eat the food] ‘Could the man really have eaten the food yet?’)
and bia (ólí ómóhé bíá' kpè é ólí émàè? [the man PAP.DUB SUB eat the food] ‘Did the
man actually yet ate the food?’).
     Relative tense ke and kpe show still another pattern with assumptive judgment.
Both follow Hypothetical kha, kpe in declaratives (ólí ómóhé khà kpé é ólí émàè [the
man PAP.HYP SUB eat the food] ‘Despite pending conditions, the man would yet eat
the food’) but ke only in interrogatives (ólí ómóhé khà ké é ólí émàè? [the man
PAP.HYP ANT eat the food] ‘Would the man eat the food afterward?’) and (ólí ómòhè
khà ké é ólí émàèé? [the man PRP.HYP ANT eat the food] ‘Would the man have eaten
the food afterward?’). Neither ke nor kpe occurs with Concessive rere.","[133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142]"
"7.2 Predicate focus
Predicate focus constructions exhibit a focus constituent with a nominalized verb
followed by a matrix clause. In focus position, they employ the matrix clause verb’s
gerundive form (uVERBmi) (Chapter 2, 2.3.2). Regardless of positive or negative fo-
cus, these constructions are highly constrained and very infrequently used. More so
than nominal focus, predicate focus constructions severely constrain modifiers in
focus position as well as auxiliaries and preverbs in their matrix clause.
     Positive and negative focus particles differentially constrain focus position ge-
rundive constituents. With unmodified gerundive nominals in focus position, the
positive focus particle itself is optional.(25) úkhùmí (lí) òhí khú'         ólí éwè.
     chasing PF Ohi PAP.chase the goat
     ‘Chasing is what Ohi did to the goat.’The negative focus particle never appears with an unmodified gerundive in focus
position. It only occurs with gerundives that are modified.(26) úkhùmí lì kéré / *úkhùmí kí òhí khú'               ólí éwè.
     chasing R small chasing NF Ohi PAP.chase the goat
     ‘It was not a little chasing that Ohi did to the goat.’Gerundive nominals in focus position limit postdeterminers. Gerundive údàmí ‘be-
ing tall’ derived from stative da ‘be tall’ allows contrastive kindred ódàn ‘different
kind’ as well as unmarked attributive phrases, e.g. óbè ‘bad.’ údàmí never accepts
deictic kindred, demonstratives, numerals or quantifiers.

        tallness bad being.tall PF the youth           PAP.be.tall-F
        ‘It was extraordinary tallness that the youth showed.’    Predicate focus constructions severely constrain expression of polarity and
mood. They do not appear as negative statements, imperatives, prohibitives or polar
interrogatives, as unacceptable interrogatives suggest (*úkhùmí lí òhí khú' ólí éwè?
[chasing PF Ohi PAP.chase the goat] ‘Was it chasing that Ohi did to the goat?’).
    Matrix clauses in predicate focus constructions are additionally constrained.
They limit inflection and accept no auxiliaries or preverbs. They inflect for Past
perfect but not Present perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect. Predicate focus
matrix clauses also reject auxiliary marking. They disallow deontic or epistemic
modality, in addition to relative tense. As well, matrix clauses with gerundive focus
do not accept any preverbs. Regarding subordination, predicate focus constructions
never appear under indicative, conditional or subjunctive S-complements, as unac-
ceptable predicate focus under indicative khi suggests (*òjè één-í khí úkhùmí lí ólí
ómóhé khú' ólí éwè [Oje PRP.know-F IND chasing PF the man PAP.chase the goat]
‘Oje knew that it was chasing that the man did to the goat’).(28) úkhùmí lí ólí ómóhé khú'            ólí éwè.
     chasing PF the man PAP.chase the goat
     ‘It was chasing that the man did to the goat.’    Turning to focus position, it reveals a number of conditions that constrain ge-
rundives. Gerundives appear only under contrastive conditions where an alternative
event exists which could have affected the subject of an intransitive verb or the
direct object of a transitive verb. The verbs lo ‘grind,’ shen ‘sell’ and e ‘eat’ in gerun-
dive form appear in predicate focus position when the speaker seeks to contrast the
hearer’s assumed knowledge state with his own.(29) a. úlòmí      lí ólí ómóhé ló'           ólí ókà.

       eating PF the man PAP.eat the maize
       ‘It was eating that the man did to the maize.’
       ‘What the man did to the maize was eat it.’ (not sell it)Predicate focus constructions are highly dependent on speaker understanding of
hearer assumptions about situational context, since those assumptions are the basis
for invoking the contrastive function of focus. For action verbs with complex com-
plements (e.g. de ‘buy’), verb complement contrast appears pragmatically difficult
to construe.8 The same is true for communication and cognition verbs (e.g. ta
‘speak’). And for stative verbs (rere ‘be far’), readily available contrastive conditions
are not easily discernable outside of very specific contexts.(30) a. *údèmí lí ójé dé'          ólí úkpún vbí óbó ísì àlèkè.
         buying PF Oje PAP.buy the cloth LOC hand ASS Aleke

         being.far PF the village PAP.be.far-F
         ‘It was far away that the village was.’Predicate focus position selectively affects verbs in series. With motion events ex-
pressed by a manner verb (sua ‘push’ or la ‘run’) and a direction verb (o ‘enter’), the
gerundive nominal in focus position corresponds to manner, not direction (*úòmí lí
ólí ómóhé súá' ólì èkpètè / lá' ó vbí ékóà [entering PF the man PAP.push the stool
PAP.run enter LOC room] ‘It was by entering that the man pushed the stool / ran

        running PF the child PAP.run enter LOC room
        ‘It was running that the child did to enter the room.’7.3 Topicalization
Topic (left-dislocation) constructions manifest two structural constituents. They
exhibit a topic in leftmost position characterized by falling intonation (represented
362 | Noncanonical constructionsorthographically by a comma) and a matrix clause in which the topic bears a gram-
matical relation. Topic position holds information shared by speaker and hearer.
The matrix clause expresses nonshared information.
    Topic constructions limit the syntactic character of topic position and its matrix
clause. In the matrix clause, grammatical marking of the position corresponding to
topic differs from that in focus constructions, as does the distribution of auxiliaries
and preverbs.","[385, 386, 387, 388]"
"                    V   MA EX MD / FQ / QU / PL TD6.1      Overview of temporal adverbials
Temporal deictic adverbials consist of morphosyntactically simple and complex
forms. They correspond to either or both of the question frames éghè re and í yi. One
class of simple temporal lexemes specifies day units or day subinterval units relative
to moment of utterance. Another class segments the time line into larger-than-day
units.
                                               Overview of temporal adverbials | 289     Morphosyntactically simple temporal adverbs express day units: òdè ‘yester-
day,’ éènà ‘today,’ and ákhò ‘tomorrow.’ All correspond to question frame éghè re,
although the day past form, i.e. ákhò ‘tomorrow,’ also shows an í yi question.
     Morphosyntactically simple and complex adverbial forms, depending on day
unit, express subintervals semantically grounded to day units. Subinterval adverbs
grounded to moment of utterance refer to immediate present (ènyáà ‘just
now/present’) and immediate past (èghéènà ‘recently’) with morphosyntactically
simple and complex forms, respectively. The corresponding information question
for immediate present is framed by í yi, and for immediate past by éghè re.
     Subinterval adverbs grounded to units for past day (ékhèdéà ‘day before yester-
day’) and future day (òtíàkhó ‘day after tomorrow’) show complex forms whose
morphological make up remains opaque. Their corresponding information question
frame is éghè re.
     Subinterval adverbs within past are morphosyntactically complex forms involv-
ing partial or complete reduplication: èdèdé ‘not long ago, a while ago,’ ìghéèghé
‘generations past, long time ago.’ Their corresponding information questions are
framed by éghè re and í yi, with the latter reserved for most distant past: ìghéèghé.
     A distal future adverbial grounded to present day is phrasal: ùsúmú éènà ‘nine
days from today.’ Its corresponding information question is éghè re.
     Simple deictic adverbs (éénà, ákhò, and òdè) combine with nominal and modifi-
er forms to shape complex adverbial phrases. Day-partitive nominal expressions
combine with day unit forms to denote one of four day divisions: égbìà ‘morning,’
ódìànmì ‘afternoon,’ énwàà ‘evening’ and ásòn ‘night.’ Their corresponding infor-
mation question frame is éghè re, although those related to òdè ‘yesterday’ also
accept í yi.égbíá éénà ‘morning of today’          ódíánmí éénà ‘afternoon of today’
égbíá ákhò ‘tomorrow morning’          ódíánmí ákhò ‘tomorrowafternoon’

énwáá ákhò ‘tomorrow evening’          ásón ákhò ‘tomorrow night’
énwáá òdè ‘yesterday evening’          ásón òdè ‘yesterday night’   Day-partitives also combine with subinterval day unit expressions within past
and future domains. The corresponding information question for these complex
adverbials is éghè re. Only subintervals of immediate present (i.e. ènyáà) do not
combine with day-partitives.ódíánmí èkhèdèà                        ódíánmí òtíàkhó

poral predeterminer (TP) élá ‘the time unit we discussed,’ or its emphatic form élélá.
Only the morphosyntactically simple adverb for past day unit (i.e. òdè) accepts the
temporal predeterminer in its basic or emphatic form. Day-unit forms for present
(*élá éènà / *élélá éènà ‘the today we talked about’) and future (*élá ákhò / *élélá
ákhò ‘the tomorrow we discussed’) do not. Temporal adverbs modified by the tem-
poral predeterminer only correspond to information questions framed by í yi ‘which

predeterminer. Subinterval expressions within present and future domains,
however, reject the temporal predeterminer in its basic form (*élá ùsúmú éènà ‘the
fortnight from today we discussed’) or emphatic form (*élélá òtíàkhó ‘the day after
tomorrow we discussed’).élá ékhèdéà ‘the day before yesterday we discussed’

predeterminer.élá / élélá énwáà ‘the evening discussed’

*élá / élélá ódíánmí ákhò ‘the afternoon of tomorrow we discussed’
*élá / élélá ódíánmí òdè ‘the afternoon of yesterday we discussed’    Nominals referring to time segments exceeding a single day and modified by a
temporal phrase or clause with deictic character serve as adverbials. The forms ósè

of édè ‘day.’ Some occur as complements of preposition vbi, while others do not.
Temporal adjuncts headed by éghè ‘time’ and modified by distal demonstrative áìn
or definite predeterminer ólì serve exclusively as temporal anaphors. Only ólí éghè

corresponding direct question, preverbs accessing temporal countour, polarity,
mood and discourse repositioning. The morphosyntactically simple lexeme òdè
refers to day unit ‘yesterday.’ It appears only in Past perfect; it never occurs in Pre-
sent perfect, nor in imperfect or prospective aspect. The subinterval ékhèdéà ‘day
before yesterday’ is distributionally similar to òdè.(1) ólí ómóhé é'        ólí émáé òdè.

     Relative to mood and polarity, òdè appears in clauses structured as negative
statements (ólí ómòhè í ì è ólí émáé òdè [the man SC NEG eat the food yesterday] ‘The
man did not eat the food yesterday’) or polar questions (ólí ómóhé é' ólí émáé òdè?
[the man PAP.eat the food yesterday] ‘Did the man eat the food yesteday?’). But it
fails to occur in imperative or prohibitive clauses.
     Adverb òdè also occupies either li/ni focus position or topic position.(4) a. òdè        lí ólí ómóhé é'          ólí émàè.

‘generations ago’ and èdèdé ‘not long ago.’ Their syntactic distribution is nonuni-
form. Past subinterval èdèdé occurs in the Past perfect, failing to appear in the Pre-
sent perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(5) ólí ómóhé é'        ólí émáé èdèdé.
    the man PAP.eat the food not.long.ago
    ‘The man ate the food some moments ago / not long ago.’èdèdé corresponds to direct questions framed by éghè re but not í yi. Responses

    ‘Some time ago.’        ‘It was some time ago that he ate it.’     Past subinterval adverb èdèdé is limited to Past Absolute functions of aspectual-
izer preverbs ya (ólí ómóhé yà é ólí émá èdèdé [the man PAP.PA eat the yam
not.long.ago] ‘The man used to eat the yam some time ago’) and mo (ólí ómóhé mó' é

294 | Adverbial adjuncts     èdèdé’s distribution as to polarity and mood is restricted. It occurs in clauses
expressing perfect negation (ólí ómòhè í ì è ólí émáé èdèdé [the man SC NEG eat the

their Ingressive and Egressive functions.
    Regarding polarity and mood, ìghéèghé is restricted. It appears in polar ques-
tions inflected for Habitual (á à sì ìkìtìbé ìghéèghé? [one H inhale.with pipe long.ago]
‘Do generations ago inhale with pipes?’). It also occurs with Past Absolute negation
(á yà sì ìkìtìbé ìghéèghé [one PANEG inhale.with pipe long.ago] ‘Pipes were never
inhaled generations ago’), not perfect negation. ìghéèghé fails in imperatives and
prohibitives.
    As to discourse, ìghéèghé appears in topic position but not in li/ni focus posi-
tion.

     long.ago one H inhale.with pipe
     ‘In the long ago past, pipes were inhaled.’     The lexeme for day unit ‘tomorrow’ is ákhò. Its subinterval is expressed by the
morphologically opaque derivative òtíàkhó ‘day after tommorrow.’ ákhò is confined
to prospective aspect, appearing in clauses inflected for Predictive and Anticipative.
It fails in either perfect or imperfect aspect.(11) a. ólí ómóhé ló       è ólí émáé ákhò.
        the man PRED eat the food tomorrow
        ‘The man will eat the food tomorrow.’

     ‘When will the man eat the food?’
     ákhò.
     tomorrow
     ‘Tomorrow.’     The distribution of ákhò reveals additional semantic and syntactic properties.
ákhò accepts no functions associated with phasal aspectualizers ya and mo, includ-
ing their respective Ingressive (*ólí ómòhè yà é ólí émáé ákhò [the man PRP.IG eat

sive functions (*ólí ómòhè móò é ólí émáé léé ákhò [the man PRP.EG eat the food
TEMP tomorrow] ‘The man almost finished eating the food tomorrow’).
     With regard to polarity and mood, ákhò is the least restricted day unit adverb. In
polarity constructions, ákhò requires Prospective negation kha (ólí ómòhè í khà è ólí
émáé ákhò [the man SC PRONEG eat the food tomorrow] ‘The man will not eat the
food tomorrow’) and appears in polar questions framed by Predictive aspect (ólí
ómóhé ló è ólí émáé ákhò? [the man PRED eat the food tomorrow] ‘Will the man eat
the food tomorrow?’).
     ákhò also appears in imperatives (è ólí émáé ákhò ò [eat the food tomorrow INT]
‘Eat the food tomorrow, you know’ (you will not expect to but do)) and prohibitives
(é è é émáé ákhò ò [you PR eat food tomorrow INT] ‘Don't eat food tomorrow, you
296 | Adverbial adjunctswill expect to but don’t’). However, it does so only with the contrary-to- expectation
interjection o.
     ákhò’s discourse position is not restricted. It occupies li/ni marked focus posi-
tion or topic position.(13) a. ákhò        lí ólí ómóhé ló      è ólí émàè.

        tomorrow the man PRED eat the food
        ‘Tomorrow, the man will eat the food.’    A distal subinterval within day unit ‘tomorrow’ is ùsúmú éènà ‘nine days from
today.’1 It incorporates relational noun ùsúmù ‘nine days from’ and day unit éènà
‘today.’ It requires prospective Predictive but disallows prospective Anticipative. As
well, it occurs with neither perfect nor imperfect aspect.(14) ólí ómóhé ló      yè       ímé ùsúmú éènà.
     the man PRED move.to farm 9.day today

     9.day today
     ‘Nine days from today /in a fortnight.’    Additional constructions reveal syntactic and semantic properties of ùsúmú
éènà. It rejects all functions of boundary aspectualizers ya (*ólí ómòhè yà dá ólí ényó

PRP.EG drink the wine TEMP 9.day today] ‘The man almost finished drinking the

    With polarity and mood, ùsúmú éènà is unrestricted. Regarding polarity, ùsúmú
éènà requires prospective negation kha (ólí ómòhè í khà yè ólí ímé ùsúmú éènà [the
man SC PRONEG move.to the farm 9.day today] ‘The man will not go to the farm

maize today] ‘The man almost sold the maize today’) and mo (*ólí ómòhè móò shén
ólí óká éènà [the man PRP.PA sell the maize today] ‘The man almost finished selling

298 | Adverbial adjuncts     Concerning polarity and mood, éènà requires prospective negation kha in nega-
tive statements (ólí ómòhè í khà è ólí émáé éènà [the man SC PRONEG eat the food
today] ‘The man will not eat the food today’) or prospective Predictive in polar ques-
tions (ólí ómóhé ló è ólí émáé éènà? [the man PRED eat the food today] ‘Will the man

     éènà occurs in imperatives (è ólí émáé éènà ò [eat the food today INT] ‘Eat the
food today, you know (even though you may not expect to)’) and prohibitives (é è é
émáé éènà ò [you PR eat food today INT] ‘Don't eat the food today, even though you

     In polarity and mood constructions, ènyáà is restricted. It requires Ingressive ya
in imperatives (yà é ólí émáé ènyáà [IG eat the food just.now] ‘Start eating the food

uous or Anticipative aspect (ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émáé ènyáà? [the man SC C eat the

clauses expressing perfect negation or polar questions (*ólí ómòhè gbé ékpén

are formed with ósè ‘week,’ ùkìn ‘month’ and úkpè ‘year.’ They are grounded to fu-
ture or past time depending on modifier type. When accompanied by a relative
clause incorporating the verb series raa re ‘pass,’ they exhibit a distributional pat-
tern similar to òdè ‘yesterday.’ Thus, ósè,’ ùkìn and úkpè relative clause adverbials

        ‘In the past week / month / year, Oje killed a rat.’     Larger-than-day adverbials grounded to future time with ósè ‘week,’ ùkìn
‘month’ and úkpé ‘year’ assume two additional shapes. They are framed by relator
phrase lì òdè or by definite article ólí and proximal demonstrative nà. These shapes
are aspectually restricted. Larger-than-day adverbials take only prospective Predic-
tive, not Anticipative and not perfect or imperfect aspect.(29) a. ólí ómóhé ló       gbè ólí ófé ósé / úkín / úkpé lì òdè.

man PAP.PA kill rat TP year] ‘The man used to kill rats the year we talked about’)
but not Past Absolute mo. It also disallows Ingressive ya and Egressive mo.
     Polarity and mood expression for élá úkpè is somewhat limited. Allowed are
perfect negation (ólí ómòhè í ì gbè ófé élá úkpè [the man SC NEG kill rat TP year] ‘The
man did not kill a rat the year we talked about’) and polar questions (ólí ómóhé gbé'
304 | Adverbial adjunctsófé élá úkpè? [the man PAP.kill rat TP year] ‘Did the man kill a rat in the year we

        TP year the man PAP.kill the rat
        ‘In the year we discussed, the man killed the rat.’    There are additional adverbials that show unique temporal reference. The com-
plex adverbial úkpèénà ‘this season’ appears derived from úkpè ‘year’ and éènà
‘today’ or possibly úkpè ‘year’ and nà ‘this.’ It refers to recent past or distal future. It
does not accept any modifiers.
    úkpèénà occurs in clauses inflected for Present perfect or prospective Predictive,
although not for Past perfect, prospective Anticipative or imperfect aspect.(36) a. ólí ómòhè kó          émá úkpèénà.

son?’) or prospective Predictive (ólí ómóhé ló kò émá úkpèénà? [the man PRED plant

     úkpèénà occurs in imperatives, requiring contrary-to-expectation interjection o

may not expect to’), and in prohibitives (é è kó émá úkpèénà [you PR plant yam

     úkpèénà also occupies focus or topic position. When doing so, its matrix clause
shows Predictive aspect or Past perfect, not the expected Present perfect.(38) a. úkpèénà        òkpá lí ólí ómóhé kó'            émà.

        this.season the man PRED plant yam
        ‘As for this season, the man will plant yam then.’    Temporal adverbials of another type are framed by nominal éghè ‘time.’ It heads
an adverbial phrase with anaphoric function when modified by definite predeter-
miner ólí or distal demonstrative áìn ‘that.’2
    éghé áìn and ólí éghè phrases serve as anaphors in narrative discourse. They
show an emphatic appositive relation to a preceding temporal condition kha clause,
which serves as antecedent.(39) a. ò khà        gbé ófè léé,    éghé áìn, ò váló             óì.

        ‘When he finished killing the rat, at the time, he butchered it.’
306 | Adverbial adjuncts     The nominal éghé áìn ‘those times’ with plural significance also heads an ad-
verbial phrase with indefinite reference. Neither proximal (nà ‘these’) nor contras-
tive (nóì ‘other’) demonstrative co-occur with éghè in such an adverbial phrase.(40) ójé ó ò khù íhúá          éghé áìn / *éghé nà / *éghé nóì.

     *éghé áìn.

ards at those times’) and mo (ólí ómóhé mó' gbé ékpén éghé áìn [the man PAP.PA kill
leopard time those] ‘The man killed leopards at one of those times in the past’). It
rejects their Ingressive and Egressive functions.
    The éghé áìn adverbial is limited to affirmative declarative statements. It rejects
negative statements, as indicated by the failure of Past Absolute negation ya (*ólí

hibitives.
    As for discourse repositioning, éghé áìn occupies topic but not focus position.(43) éghé áìn, ólí ómóhé yà           gbé èkpèn.
     time those the man PAP.PA kill leopard
     ‘At those times, the man used to kill leopards.’    The nominal éghè ‘time’ modified by the definite predeterminer occurs as com-

the sense ‘at that/this time, at the time we know.’ vbí ólí éghè adverbials appear in
clauses inflected for Past perfect and Habitual but not Present perfect, Continuous,

a complement consisting of the relational noun ékéín ‘inside’ followed by nominal
úkpédè/íkpédè ‘day’ and a cardinal numeral. Anchored to the moment of utterance

within which an event occurs and beyond which it does not. Constructions with
temporal bound adverbials require a predicate phrase referring to an internally
bounded event, as happens with the bounded verb u óì ‘do it’ or with unbounded
hian ‘cut’ in construction with postverbal Temporal Perspective lee.(55) a. ójé ú'        óí vbí ékéín íkpédè èéà.

        Oje PRED cut the wood TEMP LOC inside days three
        ‘Oje will finish cutting the wood within three days.’Temporal bound adverbials are limited to clauses inflected for Past perfect and Pre-
dictive. They reject Present perfect, Anticipative and imperfect.(56) a. ójé híán'      ólí óràn léé     vbí ékéín íkpédè èéà.

        Oje PRED cut the wood TEMP LOC inside days three
        ‘Oje will finish cutting the wood within three days.’Temporal bound adverbials fail to correspond to direct questions framed by nominal
íkpédé ‘day’ and ékà ‘quantity, how many’ or í yi ‘which one.’(57) *ékéín íkpédé ékà     ó (ré')        híán ólí óràn léé?
      inside days quantity he PAP.take cut the wood TEMP
      ‘Within how many days did he finish cutting the wood?’
     *ékéín íkpédè èéà.
      inside days three
      ‘Within three days.’     Additional properties of temporal bound adjuncts arise in selected construc-
tions. Clauses with vbí ékéín íkpédè adverbials occur as imperatives (rè ékéín íkpédè
èéà híán ólí óràn léé [take inside days three cut the wood TEMP] ‘Finish cutting the
wood within three days’), where the temporal phrase occurs as complement of verb
re ‘take’ in series. Bound vbí ékéín íkpédè adverbials fail as prohibitives, negative
statements or polar questions.
     Temporal bound adjuncts fail to co-occur with any functions of boundary aspec-
tualizer preverbs ya (*ólí ómóhé yà híán óràn léé vbí ékéín íkpédè èéà [the man

wood within three days’).
    In discourse, temporal bound adverbials fail in focus and topic position.(58) a. *ékéín íkpédè èéà lí ójé ré'             híán ólí óràn léé.

         ‘As for three days, Oje finished cutting the wood within it.’6.1.5 Temporal frequency adverbsTemporal frequency adverbials occur in morphosyntactic shapes derived from a
cardinal numeral. Articulating event frequency or iteration, they correspond to ísékà
‘how often’ direct questions and fall into four subclasses.
     Members of one subclass reflect a definite, absolute frequency value. Morpho-
logically definite frequency forms are expressed as synthetic compounds consisting
of a numeral preceded by prefix ì- and the verb se ‘reach.’ There is no evidence of a
restriction on numeral participation in this morphological shape.ìsòkpá ‘once’                            ìsèéá ‘thrice’
ìsèvá ‘twice’                            ìsèélè ‘four times’Absolute frequency adverbs occur in clauses inflected for Past perfect and prospec-
tive Predictive. They reject Present perfect, imperfect and Anticipative.(59) a. ólí ómóhé é'        émáé ìsèvá.
        the man PAP.eat food twice
        ‘The man ate food twice.’
     b. ólí ómóhé ló      è ólí émáé ìsòkpá.
        the man PRED eat the food once
        ‘The man will eat the food once.’Absolute frequency adverbs correspond to direct questions framed by ísékà.
                                                 Overview of temporal adverbials | 313(60) ísékà     ólí ómóhé é'         émàè?
     how.often the man PAP.eat food
     ‘How often did the man eat food?’
     ìsèvá.
     twice
     ‘Twice.’     Additional properties of absolute frequency adverbs emerge in selected con-
structions. They appear in imperatives (è ólí émáé ìsòkpá [eat the food once] ‘Eat the
food at once’) and prohibitives (é è é ólí émàè léé ìsòkpá [you PR eat the food TEMP
once] ‘Don't finish eating the food all at once’). However, absolute frequency ad-
verbs never occur in negative statements or polar questions.
     Absolute frequency adverbs never accept either function of aspectualizers ya
(*ólí ómòhè yà é ólí émáé ìsèvá [the man PRP.IG eat the food twice] ‘The man almost
started to eat the food twice’) and mo (*ólí ómòhè móò é ólí émáé ìsèvá [the man
PRP.EG eat the food twice] ‘The man almost completed eating the food twice’).
     Discourse repositioning of absolute frequency adverbs is partially restricted.
They occupy focus position but not topic position.(61) ìsèvá lí ólí ómóhé é'          ólí émàè.
     twice PF the man PAP.eat the food
     ‘It was twice that the man ate the food.’    A second subclass of the temporal frequency adverbial type appears as a day
partitive phrase. Members are headed by an absolute frequency adverb followed by
a vbi phrase whose complement is the derived nominal úkpédè ‘day.’ Partitive fre-
quency adverbials appear in clauses inflected for imperfect Habitual, but not Con-
tinuous, perfect or prospective aspect.(62) yán à khùàn ífí ísì ìyáín ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè.
     they H set       trap ASS their once LOC day
     ‘They set their trap once per day.’Partitive frequency adverbials correspond to ísékà direct questions.(63) ísékà      yán à khùàn ífí       ísì ìyáín?
     how.often they H set       trap ASS their
     ‘How often do they set their traps?’
     ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè.
     once LOC day
     ‘Once per day.’
314 | Adverbial adjuncts    Additional properties of partitive frequency adverbials emerge from selected
constructions. Regarding mood and polarity, partitive frequency adverbials do not
appear in imperatives, prohibitives, negative statements or polar questions, as polar
questions suggest (e.g.*yán à khùàn ífí ísì ìyáín ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè? [they H set trap
ASS their once LOC day] ‘Did they set their trap once per day?’).
    Partitive frequency adjuncts fail with all functions of aspectualizer preverbs ya
(*yán yà khúán ífí ísì ìyáín ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè [they PAP.PA set trap ASS their once
LOC day] ‘They used to set their traps once per day’) and mo (*yán mó khúán ífí ísì
ìyáín ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè [they PAP.PA set trap ASS their once LOC day] ‘They at one
time set their traps once per day’).
    Discourse repositioning of partitive frequency adverbials is restricted. They ap-
pear as a phrasal unit in focus position but not in topic position.(64) ìsòkpá vbí úkpédè lí yán à khùàn ífí ísì ìyáín.
     once LOC day           PF they H set       trap ASS their
     ‘It is once per day that they set their trap.’     A third subclass of frequency adverbials establishes an indefinite temporal
frame for an event. Members are either monomorphemic (sàá) or reduplicated forms
of temporal base nouns (édè ‘day’ and éghè ‘time’).édèédè ‘daily’                           sàá ‘always’
éghèéghè ‘all the time, every time’Indefinite frequency adverbs appear only in clauses inflected for imperfect Habitual.
They reject Continuous, perfect and prospective aspect.(65) ólí ómóhé ó ò è émáé édèédè / éghèéghè /                sàá.
     the man SC H eat food daily              all.the.time   always
     ‘The man eats food daily / all the time / always.’Indefinite frequency adverbs correspond to ísékà questions with Habitual aspect
and a partitive vbi phrase incorporating a temporal noun.(66) ísékà      ólí ómóhé ó ò è émá vbí úkpè?
     how.often the man SC H eat yam LOC year
     ‘How often in the year does the man eat yam?’
     ó ò è émá édèédè / éghèéghè / sàá.
     he H eat yam daily         all.the.time always
     ‘He eats yam daily / all the time / always.’

structions. Concerning polarity and mood, indefinite frequency adverbs appear in
polar questions (ólí ómóhé ó ò è émáé édèédè? [the man SC H eat food daily] ‘Does
the man eat food daily?’). They fail in imperatives, prohibitives and negatives.
    Indefinite frequency adverbs do not allow any functions associated with aspec-
tualizers ya (*ólí ómóhé yà é émáé édèédè [the man PAP.PA eat food daily] ‘The man
used to eat food daily’) and mo (*ólí ómóhé mó' é émáé édèédè [the man PAP.PA eat
food daily] ‘The man at one time ate food daily’).
    Adverbs in the indefinite frequency subclass show limited repositioning in dis-
course. All but sàá occupy focus position, although éghèéghè requires that its matrix
clause show verb re ‘take’ in series. No indefinite frequency adverb serves as topic.(67) a. édèédè lí má à è émà.
         daily PF we H eat yam
         ‘It is daily that we eat yam.’
     b. éghèéghè lí ó ò rè várè vbí ààn.

         ‘It is all the time that he comes here.’

         always PF the man SC H eat yam
         ‘It is always the case that the man eats yam.’     A fourth subclass of temporal frequency consists of negative polarity ghè. It re-
quires perfect negation (ólí ómòhè í ì sé gbè ófé ghè [the man SC NEG DUR kill rat
ever] ‘The man still did not ever kill rats’), although internally bounded verb gbe
‘kill’ also necessitates Durative aspectualizer se. ghè disallows prospective negation
kha (*ólí ómòhè í khà è ólí émáé ghè [the man SC PRONEG eat the food ever] ‘The
man will not eat the food ever’) and past absolute negation ya (*ólí ómòhè í yà è émá
ghè [the man SC PANEG eat yam ever] ‘The man never ever eats yam’).
     Adverb ghè never appears in affirmative constructions with perfect, imperfect or
prospective aspect. Its corresponding direct question shows ísékà and Durative se.(68) ísékà        ólí ómóhé sé'           gbé ófè?

316 | Adverbial adjuncts    Negative polarity ghè fails in imperatives, prohibitives and polar questions (*ólí
ómòhè í ì sé gbè ófé ghè? [the man SC NEG DUR kill rat ever] Did the man still not
ever kill rats?’).
    In discourse, ghè is also limited. It never occurs in focus or topic position.(69) *ghè lí ólí ómòhè í ì         sé      gbè ófè.
      ever PF the man SC NEG DUR kill rat
      ‘It was never that the man still killed a rat.’6.1.6 Temporal extent adverbsTemporal extent adverbs specify the temporal length of an event relative to event
onset. Morphologically, some extent adverbs exhibit triplication: títítí ‘a long time,’
and kékéké ‘continuously;’ others do not, e.g. wèéé ‘short time.’ Temporal extent
adverbs correspond to the question frame ébé' ~ ébí'...i... tee se ‘how long.’
    Temporal extent adverbs appear in clauses inflected for Past perfect. They reject
Present perfect as well as imperfect and prospective aspect.(70) a. ólí ómóhé múzán-í'      títítí.
        the man PAP.wait-F long.time
        ‘The man waited for a long time.’
     b. ólí ómóhé múzán-í'      wèéé.
        the man PAP.wait-F short.time
        ‘The man waited for a short time.’Temporal extent adverbs serve as responses to the direct question frame
ébé'/ébí'...i...tee se. Responses require temporal extent adverbs in situ in declarative
constructions. Simple adverb phrase responses are unacceptable.(71) ébé' ólí ómóhé í'            mùzàn téé        sè?

     he PAP.wait-F long.time               long.time
     ‘He waited for a long time.’          ‘For a long time.’    Temporal extent adjuncts are highly selective in their occurrence with verbs,
even those with inherently durative capability like vie ‘cry.’

      the youth      PAP.cry-F long.time short.time
      ‘The youth cried for a long time / a short time.’     Additional properties of temporal extent adverbs are conveyed by selected con-
structions. As with other extent adjuncts, temporal extent restricts polarity and
mood. It fails in imperatives, prohibitives, polar questions and negative statements
(*ólí ómòhè í ì mùzán títítí [the man SC NEG wait long.time] ‘The man did not wait for
a long time’).
     Temporal extent adverbs reject functions of aspectualizer preverbs ya (*ólí
ómóhé yà múzán títítí [the man PAP.PA wait long.time] ‘The man used to wait for a
long time’) and mo (*ólí ómóhé mó' múzán títítí [the man PAP.PA wait long.time]
‘The man at one time waited for a long time’).
     Discourse repositioning of temporal extent adverbs is disallowed. They do not
occupy topic or focus position.(73) a. *tìtìtì,     ólí ómóhé múzán'-ì.
         long.time the man PAP.wait-F

         long.time PF the man PAP.wait-F
         ‘It was a long time that the man waited.’    A distinct temporal extent adverb is kékéké ‘continuously.’ It tends to occur with
activity verbs, e.g. vie ‘cry.’ With dual sense stative verbs like muzan (‘stand’ or
‘wait’), kékéké combines only with its posture sense.(74) òjè múzán-í kékéké.
     Oje PRP.stand continuously
     ‘Oje stood / * waited continuously.’kékéké is limited to clauses inflected for Past or Present perfect. It fails to appear in
either imperfect or prospective aspect.(75) a. ólí óvbékhán víé-í'       kékéké.
        the youth      PAP.cry-F continuously

      ‘He cried continuously.’             ‘Continously.’    Additional properties of kékéké are highlighted by selected constructions.
kékéké fails to appear in imperatives, prohibitives, negative statements or polar
questions (*ólí óvbékhán víé-í' kékéké? [the youth PAP.cry-F continuously] ‘Did the
youth cry continuously?’).
    kékéké disallows any functions associated with preverbs ya (*ólí óvbékhán yà víé
kékéké [the youth PAP.PA cry continuously] ‘The youth used to cry continuously’)
and mo (*ólí óvbékhán mó' víé kékéké [the youth PAP.PA cry continuously] ‘The
youth at one time cried continuously’).
    Likewise, discourse repositioning of kékéké is disallowed. kékéké fails to occupy
focus or topic position.(77) *kékéké        lí ólí óvbékhán víé'-ì.
      continuously PF the youth       PAP.cry-F
      ‘It was continuously that the youth cried.’6.1.7 Temporal rate adverbsAdverbs specifying event rate do not correspond to any direct question frame. Many
exemplars of this class show morphological reduplication or triplication. They serve
as adverbs by virtue of their syntactic position and inducement of high tone spread
in a preceding constituent.
     A typical temporal rate adverb is tóítóí ‘quickly.’ It severely restricts aspect, po-
larity, mood and discourse respositioning. tóítóí occurs only in statements marked
by the Hortative auxiliary. It rejects clauses inflected for perfect, imperfect or pro-
spective aspect.(78) ólí ómòhè í     vàré tóítóí.
     the man HOR come quickly
     ‘The man should come quickly.’

     *ó í'    vàré tóítóí.       /    *tóítóí.
      he HOR come quickly              quickly
      ‘He should come quickly.’        ‘Quickly.’    Concerning polarity and mood, temporal rate tóítóí appears in imperative con-
structions (vàré tóítóí [come quickly] ‘Come quickly’) but not prohibitives, negative
statements, or polar questions.
    Discourse repositioning of tóítóí is severely restricted. It fails in focus or topic
position.(80) *tóítóí lí ólí ómóhé í'              vàré.
      quickly PF the man PAP.HOR come
      ‘It is quickly that the man should come.’     Another temporal rate adverb is èjéèjè ‘quickly.’4 It also manifests a highly re-
stricted syntactic distribution. èjéèjè is limited to canonical declarative clauses in-
flected for imperfect aspect. It fails in perfect or prospective aspect clauses.(81) ólì òkpòsò ò ó wèlò ótóí        á èjéèjè.
     the woman SC C sweep ground CS quickly
     ‘The woman is sweeping up the ground quickly.’As with other temporal rate adverbs, èjéèjè has no direct question counterpart, not
even manner ébé'/ébí' …i ‘how.’(82) ébé' ólí ókpósó ó ò í       wèlò ótóí     á?

      quickly           she C sweep ground CS quickly
      ‘Quickly.’        ‘She is sweeping up the ground quickly.’    Relative to polarity and mood, èjéèjè appears in imperative constructions (wèlò
òtòì á èjéèjè [sweep ground CS quickly] ‘Sweep up the ground quickly’). It fails in
prohibitives, negative statements and polar questions.
320 | Adverbial adjuncts    Discourse repositioning of èjéèjé is limited. It occurs as topic when modified by
demonstrative na. The accompanying matrix clause requires perfect aspect. With
similar propositional content, èjéèjé fails in li/ni marked focus position.5(83) a. èjéèjé nà, ólí ókpósó wéló'           òtòì      á.

         ‘It was quickly that the woman swept up the ground.’6.1.8 Aspectual extent adverbsAspectual extent adverbs articulate the nature of event end state (or result) as com-
plete or partial. Most extent adverbs are severely restricted relative to their verbs.
They occur with only a single verb or a small subset of verbs with like semantic
properties. Aspectual extent forms correspond to direct question frames with
ébé'/ébí'…i…se. A few selected adverbs suggest the character of this subclass: sésésé
‘completely, neatly,’ jáún ‘completely,’ gbègbéí ‘completely’ and ghéghéghé ‘com-
pletely to the brim.’
    Aspectual extent adverb sésésé occurs with simple predicates (e.g. fuan ‘be
clean’).(84) ólí ékóà fúán-í            sésésé.
     the room PRP.be.clean-F completely
     ‘The room is absolutely clean.’sésésé also occurs with complex predicates (e.g. welo a ‘sweep up’) in clauses in-
flected for Present or Past perfect as well as prospective Predictive. It rejects pro-
spective Anticipative aspect and imperfect aspect.(85) a. ólí ókpósó wéló'      òtòì     á sésésé.
        the woman PAP.sweep ground CS completely

constructions. While not appearing in prohibitives, polar questions or negative
statements, sésésé is found in imperatives (wèlò òtòì á sésésé [sweep ground CS
completely] ‘Sweep up the ground neatly / completely’). sésésé type extent adverbs
fail with aspectualizer preverbs ya (*ólí ókpósó yà wéló òtòì á sésésé [the woman

         neatly PF the woman PAP.sweep ground CS
         ‘It was completely that the woman swept up the ground.’
     b. *sésésé, ólí ókpósó wéló'        òtòì     á.
         neatly, the woman PAP.sweep ground CS
         ‘As for completely, the woman swept the ground up that way.’     The aspectual extent adverb jáún co-occurs with the complex predicate too a
‘burn up.’ Its clause inflects for Present and Past perfect as well as prospective Pre-
dictive. It rejects prospective Anticipative and imperfect aspect.(88) a. ólí ógó tóó'         á jáún.
        the bush PAP.burn CS completely
        ‘The bush burned up completely / to a crisp.’

     c. ólí ógó ló      tòò á jáún.

        ‘The bush will burn up completely.’
322 | Adverbial adjunctsLike other aspectual extent adverbs, jáún corresponds to question frame
ébé'/ébí'…i…se. In response, jáún occurs in situ, not in a simple adverb phrase.(89) ébé' ólí ógó í'           tòò sé?

     it PAP.burn CS completely            completely
     ‘It burned up completely.’           ‘Completely.’    Additional properties of jáún are highlighted by several selected constructions.
jáún fails to occur in imperatives, prohibitives, polar questions or negative state-
ments, as ungrammatical polar questions suggest (*ólì ògò tóó á jáún? [the bush
PRP.burn CS completely] ‘Did the bush burn up completely?’).
    Discourse repositioning of aspectual extent jáún is also constrained. It fails to
occupy focus or topic position.(90) *jáún       lí ólí ógó tóó'         à.
      completely PF the bush PAP.burn CS
      ‘It was completely that the bush burned up.’     A third aspectual extent adverb is gbègbéí. It also appears in narrative discourse
as forms gbèìgbéí or gbéí. Aspectual extent gbègbéí clauses inflect for perfect aspect,
rejecting prospective and imperfect aspect.(91) a. ójé vbóó'       ólí óókhó gbéí.
        Oje PAP.pluck the chicken completely
        ‘Oje plucked the chicken completely.’
     b. òjè vbóó       ólí óókhó gbéí.
        Oje PRP.pluck the chicken completely
        ‘Oje has plucked the chicken completely.’The direct question frame for gbègbéí is ébé'/ébí'…i…se. In response, gbègbéí ap-

Like other aspectual extent adverbs, gbègbéí does not appear in imperative or pro-
hibitive constructions. However, it is found in negative statements (ólí ómòhè í ì è ólí
émáé gbègbéí [the man SC NEG eat the food completely] ‘The man did not eat the
food at all’) and polar questions (ójé ánmé' óí étò á gbègbéí? [Oje PAP.scrape her hair
CS completely] ‘Did Oje scrape off her hair completely?’).
    Discourse repositioning of gbègbéí is unacceptable. Even under perfect nega-
tion, gbègbéí does not occupy focus position or topic position.(93) *gbègbéí    lí ójé ánmé'          óí étò á.
      completely PF Oje PAP.scrape her hair CS
      ‘It was completely that Oje scraped off her hair.’    Slightly more restricted is aspectual extent adverb ghéghéghé, which combines
with a predicate such as voon ‘fill.’ ghéghéghé occurs only in clauses inflected for
Past perfect. It rejects Present perfect, imperfect aspect and prospective aspect.(94) ólí émá vóón'      ìtásá     ghéghéghé.
     the yam PAP.fill plate to.the.brim / completely
     ‘The yam filled the plate to the brim.’ghéghéghé corresponds to the question frame ébé'/ébí'…i…se. Responses require
ghéghéghé in situ, not a simple adverb phrase consisting solely of ghéghéghé.(95) ébé' ólí émá í'           vóón ìtásà sé?
     how the yam PAP.MAN fill plate extent
     ‘To what extent did the yam fill the plate?’

     it fill-F to.the.brim              to.the.brim
     ‘It filled to the brim.’           ‘To the brim.’     Further properties of ghéghéghé follow from selected constructions. It restricts
mood and polarity. ghéghéghé fails in imperatives, prohibitives, negatives and polar
questions, as unacceptable polar questions indicate (*ólí émá vóón' ìtásá
ghéghéghé? [the yam PAP.fill plate to.the.brim] ‘Did the yam fill the plate to the
brim?’).
     ghéghéghé does not license any functions associated with aspectualizer pre-
verbs ya (*ólí émà yà vóón ólì ìtásá ghéghéghé [the yam PRP.IG fill the plate
to.the.brim] ‘The yam almost filled the plate to the brim’) and mo (*ólí émà móò

completely filled the plate to the brim’).
324 | Adverbial adjuncts     Likewise, ghéghéghé allows no repositioning in discourse. It fails to appear in
li/ni focus position or in topic position.(96) *ghéghéghé lí ólí émá vóón'           ìtásà.
      to.the.brim PF the yam PAP.fill plate
      ‘It was to the brim that the yam filled the plate.’6.2 Place adverbials
Adjunct adverbials of place are headed by preposition vbi. Their interrogative frame
requires verb in series za ‘be located,’ although za does not appear in corresponding
declaratives. Place adjuncts show direct question frame ébé'/ébí'…za ‘where.’ vbi
adjunct questions thus differ from vbi argument questions, which disallow za.
    vbi phrases of place serving as adjuncts occur with verbs like gbe ‘kill’ that do
not subcategorize for a locative argument.6(97) ólí ómòhè gbé        ólí ófé vbí ímè.
     the man PRP.kill the rat LOC farm
     ‘The man has killed the rat on the farm.’Place adjuncts with vbi do not restrict aspect. They occur in clauses inflected for
perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.(98) a. ólí ómòhè gbé         ólí ófé vbí ímè.
        the man PRP.kill the rat LOC farm
        ‘The man has killed the rat on the farm.’

sponses show the place nominal in focus position, as a simple adverb but not in situ.(99) ébé' ólí ómóhé zá'               gbé ófè?
     where the man PAP.be.loc kill rat

     farm PF he PAP.be.loc kill it                   farm
     ‘It was at the farm that he killed it.’        ‘At the farm.’     Place adjuncts reveal additional properties. They occur in imperatives (è ólí
émáé vbí ímè [eat the food LOC farm] ‘Eat the food on the farm’), prohibitives (é è é
émáé vbí ímè [you PR eat food LOC farm] ‘Don't eat the food on the farm’) and nega-
tive statements (ólí ómòhè í ì gbè ólí ófé vbí ímè [the man SC NEG kill the rat LOC
farm] ‘The man did not kill the rat on the farm’), as well as polar questions (ólí
ómóhé gbé' ólí ófé vbí ímè? [the man PAP.kill the rat LOC farm] ‘Did the man kill the
rat on the farm?’).
     Adjuncts of place appear with preverb ya in its functions Past Absolute (ólí
ómóhé yà gbé ófé vbí ímè [the man PAP.PA kill rat LOC farm] ‘The man used to kill
rats on the farm’) and Ingressive (ólí ómòhè yà gbé ólí ófé vbí ímè [the man PRP.IG
kill the rat LOC farm] ‘The man almost killed the rat on the farm’). With aspectualiz-
er mo, only Past Absolute is allowed (ólí ómóhé mó' gbé ófé vbí ímè [the man PAP.PA
kill rat LOC farm] ‘The man at one time killed rats on the farm’).
     Discourse repositioning of place adjuncts is not restricted. They appear in focus
or topic position, although corresponding constructions are differentially marked.
Focus constructions require za in the matrix clause and disallow preposition vbi. In
contrast, topic constructions require nondeictic locative anaphor o as complement
of vbi; they disallow za.7(100) a. ímè lí ólí ómóhé zá'              gbé ófè.
         farm PF the man PAP.be.loc kill rat

         farm the man PAP.kill rat LOC it               yonder
         ‘As for the farm, the man killed a rat on it.’6.3 Manner adverbs
Manner adverbs consist of at least four subclasses. They restrict aspect, deontic
modality, polarity and mood, and appear in focus and topic position. Each manner
adverb corresponds to direct question ébé'/ ébí' …i ‘how.’
326 | Adverbial adjuncts      One manner subclass is found with verb shan ‘walk.’ Members such as dàbìdábí
‘staggeringly’ express manner variations relative to a basic walking event. Other
adverbs that occur with shan ‘walk’ include: húú, húlóhúló ‘clumsily, very clumsily,’
nwéínwéí ‘stealthily,’ nyágán ‘awkwardly, crab-like,’ nyàkhúánnyàkhúán ‘waddling-
ly,’ súné, súnésúné ‘clumsily, very clumsily,’ and váí, váíváí ‘briskly, very briskly.’8(101) ólí ómòhè ò ó shán dàbìdábí.
      the man SC C walk staggeringly
      ‘The man is walking in a staggeringly fashion / is staggering.’Although manner adverbs of this first subclass tend to occur clause finally, they can
appear after shan ‘walk’ when it is in series with shan ‘proceed to.’(102) a. òjè ò ó shán dàbìdábí           shàn    vbí èkìn.
         Oje SC C walk staggeringly proceed LOC market
         ‘Oje is staggering to / walking staggeringly to the market.’
      b. òjè ò ó shán nwéínwéí shàn            vbí èkìn.
         Oje SC C walk stealthily proceed LOC market
         ‘Oje is walking stealthily to the market.’Manner adverbs that co-occur with shan appear only in clauses inflected for Contin-
uous or Habitual imperfect. They reject perfect and prospective aspect.(103) ólí ómòhè ò ó shàn súnésúné           / váíváí        / nyágán.
      the man SC C walk very.clumsily very.briskly awkwardly
      ‘The man is walking very clumsily / very briskly / awkwardly.’Manner adjuncts with shan correspond to direct question ébé'/ébí'...i. In response,
manner adverbs appear in situ, not as a simple adverb phrase or in focus position.(104) ébé' ó ò í        shán?
      how he H MAN walk
      ‘How does he walk?’
      ó ò shán nyàkhùánnyàkhùán.           /      *nyàkhùánnyàkhùán.
      he H walk waddlingly                         waddlingly
      ‘He walks in a waddle-like fashion.’         ‘In a waddle-like fashion.’     Manner adverbs with shan restrict polarity and mood. They are not found in im-
peratives, prohibitives, negative statements or polar questions, as a polar question
with nyágán suggests (*ólí ómòhè ò ó shàn nyágán? [the man SC C walk awkwardly]
‘Is the man walking awkwardly?’).
                                                                Manner adverbs | 327   Likewise, manner adverbs associated with shan limit discourse repositioning.
They fail to occupy focus or topic position.(105) *nyágán      lí ólí ómóhé ó ò shán.
       awkwardly PF the man SC H walk
       ‘It is awkwardly that the man walks.’    A second subclass of manner adverb co-occurs with transitive verbs of con-
sumption. Members include: tùzètúzé ‘wretchedly,’ kóíkóí ‘briskly, fast paced,’ sú-
nésúné ‘clumsily,’9 and záízáí ‘hurriedly.’ Manner adverbs of this subclass appear
only in clauses inflected for imperfect Continuous or Habitual. They reject perfect
and prospective aspect.(106) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émáé kóíkóí.
         the man SC C eat the food gulpingly
         ‘The man is gulping / eating the food in a gulping fashion.’
      b. ólí ómòhè ó ó è ólí émáé súnésúné.
         the man SC C eat the food clumsily
         ‘The man is eating the food in a clumsy fashion.’Manner adverbs of consumption correspond to direct question ébé'/ébí'...i ‘how.’
Responses show the manner adverb in situ, not in a simple adverb phrase or in focus
position.(107) ébé' ólí ómóhé ó ò í         è émàè?
      how the man SC H MAN eat food
      ‘How does the man eat food?’
      ó ò è óí kóíkóí.          /       *kóíkóí.
      he H eat it briskly                briskly
      ‘He eats it briskly.’              ‘In a brisk fashion.’    Relative to polarity and mood, manner adverbs of consumption appear in im-
perative constructions (è ólí émáé kóíkóí [eat the food briskly] ‘Eat the food in a brisk
fashion’). They they fail in prohibitives, negative statements and polar questions.
    Manner adverbs of consumption restrict discourse repositioning. They do not
occur in focus position or topic position.(108) *kóíkóí, ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
       briskly the man SC C eat the food
       ‘Briskly, the man is eating food.’
328 | Adverbial adjuncts    A manner adverb with a distinct collocational range and derivational history is
ghéghéghé ‘precariously.’ Prototypically, it occurs with simple and complex predi-
cates that convey hanging events. ghéghéghé appears phonologically and semanti-
cally related to the verb gheghe ‘position precariously.’ However, there is no syn-
chronic verb ghe with the same or a related meaning.(109) a. ò ghéghé                       ólì àgá ó vbí ókhúnmí ìtébù.

      ‘It hung precariously.’                       ‘Precariously.’    Relative to polarity and mood constructions, ghéghéghé is restricted. It appears
in imperatives (nwù ólì èkpà khúán ghéghéghé [take the bag suspend precariously]
‘Hang the bag precariously’). It does not occur in prohibitives, polar questions or
negative statements.
    Discourse repositioning of ghéghéghé is restricted. It fails to occupy focus or top-
ic position.(112) *ghéghéghé lí ólí órán dé'                khùàn.

tal ìyó ‘that way’ (DMD) and proximal ìná ‘this way’ (PMD).10 In addition to the deic-
tic character of each, ìyó displays an anaphoric function, where it co-refers to an
event in preceding discourse.(113) ólí ómóhé dín'      ólí éwé ìyó / ìná.

     Discourse repositioning of ìyó is only somewhat constrained. It occupies focus
position, provided the Manner preverb i occurs in the matrix clause. ìyó never as-
sumes topic position, regardless of manner i's presence.(116) a. ìyó lí ólí ómóhé í'             dín ólí éwè.

discourse, ìyó appears in clauses inflected for perfect, imperfect or prospective as-
pect.

332 | Adverbial adjuncts6.4 Simile adjunct
The preposition bí ‘like’ (also élàbí) and its following noun phrase appear clause
finally, immediately after the verb phrase, where they serve a simile function.11 Alt-
hough bí phrases bear on interpretation of subject referent rather than clause event,
they obligatorily appear in clause final position. Unlike adverbials, bí phrases fail to
induce high tone spread in a preceding constituent. Nonetheless, they correspond to
the manner question frame ébé'/ébí' …i ‘how.’(123) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàè, bí éwè.
         the man SC C eat the food like goat
         ‘The man is eating the food like a goat.’

         the youth      SC C become.heavy like iron
         ‘The youth is getting heavy like iron.’    Simile bí phrases restrict aspect, polarity, mood and repositioning of their com-
plements. With transitive activity verbs, bí phrases require a clause inflected for
imperfect aspect; they reject perfect and prospective aspect.(124) a. ólí óvbékhán ó ò è émàè, bí òhí.

Adverbial phrases expressing reason or cause are headed by the nominal òhíó ‘be-
cause’ followed by Associative ísì and its complement. òhíó phrases are strictly or-
dered relative to their matrix clause. Reason adverbials appear clause initially, ei-
ther in focus position, verb re ‘take/use’ being obligatory in the matrix clause, or in
topic position, in which case re does not occur.(127) a. òhíó ísì òjè lí ólí ómóhé ré'             é ólí émàè léé.

         cause ASS Oje the man PAP.eat the food TEMP
         ‘Because of Oje, the man finished eating the food.’Reason adverbial phrases never occur in clause final position (*ólí ómóhé é' òlí émàè
léé òhíó ísì òjè [the man PAP.eat the food TEMP because ASS Oje] ‘The man finished
eating the food because of Oje’). In declarative clauses, they appear as noun phrase
complements of verb re ‘take.’(128) ólí ómóhé ré'         òhíó ísì òjè gbé ófè.
      the man PAP.take cause ASS Oje kill rat
      ‘The man killed rats because of Oje.’    Reason adverbials in topic position show matrix clauses exhibiting co-
occurrence restrictions relative to polarity, and mood but not aspect. Their matrix
clauses inflect for perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.

         cause ASS Oje the man ANTI eat the food
         ‘Because of Oje, the man is about to eat the food.’Noun phrase complements under Associative ísì in òhíó phrases correspond to the
direct question frame émé' ó ze khi ‘why.’ Responses show the complement of ísì in
focus position without òhíó or in simple òhíó headed associative phrases. Responses
to reason adverbials do not include in situ òhíó phrases as complement of re.(130) émé' ó zé-í'          khí ólí ómóhé é'            ólí émàè léé?

and prohibitives (é è ré òhíó ísì òkpòsò gbé égbé é [you PR take cause ASS woman kill

atives, where òhíó phrases occur as topic (òhíó ísì òjè, ólí ómòhè í ì è ólí émàè [cause

òjè lí ólí ómóhé ré' é ólí émàè léé? [cause ASS Oje PF the man PAP.take eat the food
TEMP] ‘Was it because of Oje the man finished eating the food?’).
     A related adverbial expresses benefactive justification or reason. It exhibits a
phrasal character. Its head, èrímí' ‘on behalf of,’ takes a noun phrase with no inter-
vening ísì and is limited to first person mè. It rejects second or third person pro-
nouns and lexical nouns, all of which require Associative ísì (*èrímí' ísì òjè lí áléké
ré' yé òkè [behalf ASS Oje PF Aleke PAP.take move.to Oke] ‘It was on behalf of Oje
that Aleke went to Oke).(131) èrímí' mè lí ójé ré'          yé       òkè.
      behalf me PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
      ‘It was on my behalf that Oje went to Oke.’Benefactive phrases with èrímí' occupy li/ni marked focus position, where re ‘take’
in the matrix clause is obligatory. Benefactive èrímí' shuns topic position.(132) èrímí' mè lí ójé ré'          yé       òkè.
      behalf me PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
      ‘It was on my behalf that Oje went to Oke.’Additionally, benefactive èrímí' phrases never occur as complement of re in declara-
tive structures (*ólí ómóhé ré' èrímí' mè yé òkè [the man PAP.take behalf me move.to
Oke] ‘The man on my behalf went to Oke’).
     Relative to interrogative structures, èrímí' phrases do not correspond to direct
question frame émé' ó ze khi or any other direct question.(133) émé' ó zé-í'           khí ólí ómóhé gbé' ólí óì?

      ‘Why did the man kill the thief?’
     *èrímí' mè.
      behalf me
      ‘On my behalf.’Since èrímí' phrases appear predominantly in focus constructions, they occur with
matrix clauses that inflect for Past perfect and prospective Predictive. Nonetheless,
they fail in clauses inflected for imperfect Habitual.(134) a. èrímí' mè lí ójé ré'          gbé ólí óì.

peratives, prohibitives and polar interrogatives, regardless of re occurrence. Howev-
er, erímí' adverbials in topic position co-occur with perfect negation (èrímí' mè, ólí

"3.1.1 AspectEmai articulates three clause level aspects: perfect, imperfect and prospective. Each
correlates with a distinct tonal pattern in the verb phrase. In addition, contrasting
tonal patterns in the subject phrase index event time relative to utterance time or
some discourse determined reference time. Monotransitive structures most clearly
reveal these tonal patterns.
     Perfect aspect asserts event completeness and recognizes two degrees of re-
moteness. Distal past events correlate with high downstep tone at left edge of the
verb phrase and right edge high tone in the subject phrase. Proximal past events
correlate with high tone at left edge of the verb phrase and right edge low tone in the
subject phrase. Neither shows subject concord, although a few exceptional con-
struction types exist among speaking verbs.
     Present perfect (PRP) indicates a proximal or immediate past relation between
event occurrence and time of utterance as well as an implication of present rele-
vance. In monotransitive structures in third person, PRP shows a high tone verb (é
‘eat’) and a subject phrase that is either a low tone pronoun (ò) or a lexically headed
constituent with right edge low tone (ólí ómòhè or ólí ómóhé nà).
                                             Inflectional and auxiliary categories | 101(1) a. ò é         ólí émàè.
       he PRP.eat the food
       ‘He has eaten the food.’
    b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà é           ólí émàè.
       the man      the man this PRP.eat the food
       ‘The man / This man has eaten the food.’Past perfect (PAP) specifies a distal or nonimmediate past relation between event
time and utterance time. It carries no implication of present relevance, appearing
instead to ascribe definite or emphatic character to a past event. In monotransitive
constructions inflected for PAP, verb tone is high downstep and subject phrase tone
is either high on a pronoun (ó) or right edge high on a lexically headed constituent
(ólí ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná).(2) a. ó é'         ólí émàè.
       he PAP.eat the food
       ‘He ate the food.’
    b. ólí ómóhé / ólí ómóhé ná é'        ólí émàè.
       the man       the man this PAP.eat the food
       ‘The man / This man ate the food.’Past and Present perfect show contrasting temporal adverbs. Past perfect takes òdè
‘yesterday,’ while Present perfect accepts èghéènà ‘just recently.’ Reversal of align-
ment between adverbs and perfect type is ungrammatical.(3) a. ójé nwú'      émà lí ólí ókpósó òdè / *èghéènà.
       Oje PAP.take yam APP the woman yesterday recently
       ‘Oje gave yam to the woman yesterday.’
    b. òjè nwú       émà lí ólí ókpósó èghéènà / *òdè.
       Oje PRP.take yam APP the woman recently         yesterday
       ‘Oje has given yam to the woman just recently.’    Imperfect aspect views an event as incomplete relative to moment of utterance
or reference time. For Continuous, some temporal portion of an event is coincident
with moment of utterance. This is not necessarily the case for Habitual, where an
event is not indexed to a specific point on the time line. Each imperfect is designated
by a tonal pattern affecting subject phrase and verb phrase. In monotransitive struc-
tures, verb tone is low but subject phrase tone varies according to imperfect type.
    Continuous aspect specifies the ongoing character of an event relative to mo-
ment of utterance or reference time. In monotransitive clauses with third person
subjects, Continuous is expressed by high tone ó, verb tone is low (è) and subject
102 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsphrase exhibits a low tone pronoun (ò) or low tone subject concord (ò) following a
lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(4) a. ò ó è ólí émàè.
       he C eat the food
       ‘He is eating food.’
    b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà ò ó è ólí émàè.
       the man        the man this SC C eat the food
       ‘The man / This man is eating food.’Habitual denotes the timeless character of an event, delinking it from time axis
points. In monotransitive clauses with third person subjects, Habitual is low tone ò,
verb tone is low (shèn) and subject phrase shows a high tone pronoun (ó) or subject
concord with high tone (ó) following a lexical constituent with right edge high (ólí
ómóhé, élí ímóhé ná).(5) a. ó ò shèn úkpùn.
       he H sell cloth
       ‘He sells cloth.’
    b. ólí ómóhé / élí ímóhé ná      ó ò shèn úkpùn.
       the man       the men these SC H sell cloth
       ‘The man sells / These men sell cloth.’Imperfect Continuous and Habitual adopt adverbs with distinct temporal dimen-
sions. Continuous allows adverbial ènyáà ‘just now,’ whereas Habitual accepts ad-
verbials of frequency (sàá ‘always’) or indefinite past (éghèéghè ‘generations ago’).
Reversing this assignment is ungrammatical.(6) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émáé ènyáà / *sàá.
       the man SC C eat the food just.now always
       ‘The man is eating the food now.’
    b. ólí ómóhé ó ò è émá sàá / *ènyáà.
       the man SC H eat yam always just.now
       ‘The man always eats yam.’In construction with syntactically nonelaborated subject and direct object phrases,
Habitual expresses generic statements.(7) ívbékhán ó ò gbè àkàkà.
    youth    SC H kill grasshoppers
    ‘Youngsters kill grasshoppers.’
                                              Inflectional and auxiliary categories | 103In imperfect aspect, subject concord conveys neither number nor class agreement
vis-à-vis its subject noun phrase. Concord form is constant across lexical subjects
that are singular/plural (ólí ómòhè ‘the man,’ élí ímòhè ‘the men’) and hu-
man/nonhuman (ólí ómòhè, ólì ògò ‘the bush’).(8) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
       the man SC C eat the food
       ‘The man is eating the food.’
    b. élí ímòhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
       the men SC C eat the food
       ‘The men are eating the food.’
    c. ólì ògò ò ó tòó.
       the bush SC C burn
       ‘The bush is burning.’    Prospective aspect, while specifying event nonoccurrence, recognizes a future
event with two degrees of remoteness: proximal and distal. It is expressed by high
tone ló and contrasting tonal patterns on the subject.
    Predictive ló ‘will’ allows the speaker to claim that a future event will occur at a
point distal to reference time. In bare monotransitives inflected for Predictive, verb
tone is low (è) and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or right edge
high for a lexically headed constituent (ólí ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná).(9) a. ó ló      è ólí émàè.
       he PRED eat the food
       ‘He will eat the food.’
    b. ólí ómóhé / ólí ómóhé ná ló          è ólí émàè.
       the man        the man this PRED eat the food
       ‘The man / This man will eat the food.’Anticipative ló reflects a speaker claim that an event will occur at a future point
proximal to reference time. It translates ‘about to.’ In bare monotransitives, verb
tone is low (è) and subject tone is low on a pronoun (ò) or right edge low for a lexical
constituent (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(10) a. ò ló      è ólí émàè.
        he ANTI eat the food
        ‘He is about to eat the food.’

        the man        the man this ANTI eat the food
        ‘The man / This man is about to eat the food.’
104 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsProspective types accept distinct temporal adverbs. Predictive ló allows ákhò ‘to-
morrow’ but not ènyáà ‘just now.’ Anticipative ló allows adverb ènyáà but not ákhò.(11) a. ólí ómóhé ló      è ólí émáé ákhò / *ènyáà.
        the man PRED eat the food tomorrow just.now
        ‘The man will eat the food tomorrow.’
     b. ólí ómòhè ló      è ólí émáé ènyáà / *ákhò.
        the man ANTI eat the food just.now tomorrow
        ‘The man is about to eat the food just now.’3.1.2 Predicate negationNegative inflection is expressed by three mutually exclusive forms: Perfect ì, Pro-
spective khà and Past Absolute yà. Each occurs with a subject pronoun or subject
concord í and a lexically headed subject phrase.
     Perfect Negation (NEG) is expressed by low tone ì. In third person monotransi-
tive clauses, verb tone is low (è), and subject phrase tone is either high on a pro-
noun (ó) or subject concord high í follows a lexically headed constituent with right
edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(12) a. ó ì      è émàè.
        he NEG eat food
        ‘He did not eat food.’
     b. ólí ómòhè / ólí ómóhé nà í ì             è ólí émàè.
        the man        the man this SC NEG eat the food
        ‘The man / This man is not eating the food.’Phonological shape of the Perfect Negation morpheme is constant across nomina-
tive pronouns, except for second singular [ù], and restrictive third plural [è].(13) a. í ì    / ú ù / ó ì           è ólí émàè.
        I NEG you NEG he NEG eat the food

        we NEG you NEG they NEG they NEG eat the food
        ‘We / You / They / They did not eat the food.’    Negative inflection takes two other shapes, both referring to events temporally
removed from utterance time. Prospective Negation (PRONEG) codes events that
project to a point subsequent to time of utterance. It translates ‘will not’ and relies
                                            Inflectional and auxiliary categories | 105on low tone khà, which also expresses epistemic Hypothetical.1 In third person
monotransitive clauses, Prospective Negation verb tone is low (è) and subject
phrase tone is either high for a pronoun (ó) or subject concord high tone í follows a
lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(14) a. ó khà         è ólí émàè.

naled by low tone yà ‘never.’2 In third person monotransitives, verb tone is low
(shèn) and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or high tone subject
concord í follows a lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí
ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).(15) a. ó yà        shèn úkpùn.

structions. The Prohibitive (PR) morpheme è exhibits low tone. It requires a second

tone. In bare monotransitives, verb tone (é) is high.(16) a. é è é ólí émàè.

106 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs3.1.3 ModalityEmai deontic and epistemic forms exhibit contrasting distribution and tonal pat-
terns. There is one deontic form and six epistemic forms. Within and across modali-
ty types, auxiliaries combine. Deontic Hortative use assumes that an obligation
relation exists between grammatical subject and clausal event. Showing high tone í,
it induces left edge low tone of the immediately following constitutent. Epistemic
auxiliaries convey speaker judgment about degree of probability or certainty of
proposition truth value (Palmer 2001). Three judgment types occur: rational (Deduc-
tive za, Resultative za), speculative (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba, Dubitative bia)
and assumptive (Concessive rere/re, Hypothetical kha). Epistemic forms fail to in-
duce left edge low tone in a following constituent.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"
"9.3.1.1 Assertive pattern oneIn assertive pattern one, complex CS a predicates restrict aspect but not transitivity.
The perfect is obligatory in verb transitive or intransitive form. Since CS a is neces-
sary for pattern one verbs like gbe ‘break,’ their intransitive shapes reject Factative
suffix -i. Predicates in pattern one do not allow imperfect aspect.

        ‘The pot broke.’Other verbs that pattern like gbe in complex predicates with CS a include ria, funo,
kon, valo, and foo. With transitive or intransitive ria, CS a is obligatory in the perfect.
Regardless of CS a occurrence or transitivity value, these verbs fail in the imperfect.
Intransitives in pattern one also reject the Factative suffix.(46) a. ólì òkpòsò ríá          ólí éàmì á.

Complex predicates with CS a in pattern two restrict aspect but not transitivity. They
show distinct distribution in the imperfect. CS a with a transitive verb is obligatory
in perfect and imperfect aspect.(53) a. ólí ómòhè rághá         ísè á / *rághá ísè.

        the man SC C scatter seed CS          scatter seed
        ‘The man is scattering / mixing up the seeds.’There is no intransitive counterpart for ragha. As a consequence no intransitive
predication exists with CS a or even with Factative suffix -ì.(54) a. *ólí ísè rághá         à / ò ó ràghá á.

transitive taan rejects Factative suffix -i.(58) a. óbó ísì ózí' táán'          á gádá / *táán-í' gádá.

Verbs in assertive pattern three with CS a exhibit a sense shift. For instance, khuye
reveals one sense as a simple predicate (‘close’) but another as complex predicate
with CS a (‘open’). Often, the contrasting senses show a reversive relation. Regard-
less of perfect or imperfect aspect, predication sense of khuye and CS a is ‘open.’(65) a. ólí ómòhè khúyé       úkhùèdè á.

       the man SC C close door
       ‘The man is closing / shutting the door.’Corresponding intransitive khuye a predications maintain their sense. They express
the meaning ‘open’ with perfect and imperfect aspect.(67) a. ólí úkhùèdè khúyé       á'.
        the door      PRP.close CS
        ‘The door has opened.’
     b. ólí úkhùèdè ò ó khùyé à.
        the door      SC C close CS
        ‘The door is opening.’Simple intransitive khuye has the sense ‘be closed, shut.’ It allows only perfect as-
pect and under bare predicate conditions shows Factative suffix -i.(68) ólì úkhùèdè khúyé-ì / *ò ó khùyé.
     the door       PRP.close-F SC C close
     ‘The door is shut / closed.’    Another pattern three verb with CS a that expresses a reversive semantic rela-
tion is vuye. It has transitive and intransitive shapes. With transitive vuye in perfect
or imperfect aspect, CS a contributes to the sense ‘open.’(69) a. òjè vúyé       ólì ògó á / *vúyé ólì ògó.

        Oje SC C close the bottle CS SC C close the bottle
        ‘Oje is opening the bottle.’As a complex intransitive predication, vuye and CS a again convey the sense ‘open.’
There is no way to fashion the ‘open’ sense with Factative suffix -i.(70) a. ólì ògó vúyé'          à / *vúyé'-ì.

     c. òjè ò ó vùyé ólì ògó.
        Oje SC C close the bottle
        ‘Oje is closing the bottle.’As an intransitive, vuye ‘close’ inflects for perfect and imperfect. Under bare intran-
sitive conditions in the perfect, vuye requires Factative suffix -i.(72) a. ólì ògó ò ó vùyé.
        the bottle SC C close

Complex predicates of affirmative pattern four constrain aspect but not transitivity.
CS a with transitive verb soo is obligatory in the perfect but optional in the imper-
fect. Verb lexical meaning asserts a change of state but not a maximal change. How-
ever, verb plus CS a in either perfect or imperfect entails a telic, maximal change.(77) a. ólì òkpòsò sóó       úkpún mè á / *sóó úkpún mè.

obligatory CS a. It shows no imperfect inflection and in the bare perfect fails to oc-
cur with Factative suffix -i.

CS a and assertive pattern five verbs constrain aspect and transitivity. They require
perfect aspect in their transitive shape but reject CS a in imperfect aspect. Pattern
five verbs without CS a occur in imperfect aspect. Verbs in this pattern have a lexical
meaning that implies but does not entail a telic change of maximal extent. When
combined with CS a, the resulting complex predication entails a telic change.
     For some verbs, CS a is available only in the transitive and only in the perfect.(85) a. ólì òkpòsò ánmé        óí étò á / *ánmé óí étò.
        the woman PRP.scrape his hair CS    scrape his hair

tions exhibit no intransitive shape. Thus they cannot combine with Factative -i.(86) *étó ísì òjè ánmé          á' / ánmé-ì.
      hair ASS Oje PRP.scrape CS scrape-F
      ‘The hair of Oje scraped off.’    Other verbs in pattern five include too ‘burn,’ whose intransitive shape exhibits
variable aspect. Transitive too obligatorily takes CS a in the perfect. In the imperfect
too excludes CS a.(87) a. ólí ómòhè tóó       ólì ògò á / *tóó ólì ògò.
        the man PRP.burn the bush CS burn the bush
        ‘The man burned up the bush.’
     b. ólì òkpòsò ò ó tòò ólì ògò / *tòò ólí ógó à.
        the woman SC C burn the bush     burn the bush CS
        ‘The woman is burning the bush.’As an intransitive in the perfect, too optionally takes CS a. Under bare predicate
conditions in the perfect it allows Factative suffix -i. In the imperfect, intransitive
too rejects CS a.(88) a. ólì ògò tóó         á' / tóó-ì.
        the bush PRP.burn CS burn-F
        ‘The bush burned up / burned.’
     b. ólì ògò ò ó tòó / *tòó á.

        ‘The bush is burning.’     Complex predicates of pattern five with anme and CS a evince additional prop-
erties in the expression of aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as
argument repositioning in discourse. Complex anme a predicates serve as responses
to émé' u ‘do’ and émé' u ‘happen’ questions.(89) émé' ójé ú'-ì?         >   ò ánmé          óí étò á.

Confirmative patterns affect verbs that assert a change of state but imply a telic end
state of maximal extent. CS a confirms end state actualization That CS a predica-
tions bear on implied and asserted meaning is shown by contrastive àmáà ‘but’
constructions. When perfect negation ì appears in àmáà’s second conjunct express-
ing an implied element of meaning, verbs without CS a in the first conjunct are
grammatical. However, verbs with CS a in the first conjunct are ungrammatical.(93) a. ójé kpé'       ólì òkpàn àmáà ó ì        fùàn.
        Oje PAP.wash the gourd but it NEG be.clean
        ‘Oje washed the gourd but it was not clean.’
     b. *ójé kpé'       ólì òkpàn á àmáà ó ì         fùàn.

tivity. In perfect aspect, complex CS a transitive predications contrast with simple
predications. Confirming complex CS a predicates fail to occur in imperfect aspect.(94) a. ólí óvbékhán kpé'        ólì òkpàn á.
        the youth    PAP.wash the gourd CS

        the youth     PAP.wash the gourd
        ‘The youth washed the gourd.’For verbs in confirmative pattern one, CS a is only available in the transitive and
only in the perfect, where it is optional. The imperfect disallows CS a.(95) a. ólí óvbékhán kpé'        ólì òkpàn á.
        the youth      PAP.wash the gourd CS
        ‘The youth washed off the gourd.’

        the youth      SC C wash the gourd    SC C wash the gourd CS
        ‘The youth is washing the gourd.’An intransitive shape is unavailable for confirmative pattern one verbs. As a result,
there is no intransitive that can attract either CS a or Factative suffix -i.(96) a. *ólì òkpàn kpé         á' / kpé-ì.
         the gourd PRP.wash CS wash-F

tioning of arguments. Complex predicates with kpe a fail as responses to émé' u
‘happen’ questions but not to émé' u ‘do’ questions.(99) émé' ó ú'?                > *òjè kpé       ìtásà á.

Complex CS a predicates of confirmative pattern two limit neither transitivity nor
aspect. With transitive hian ‘cut’ and direct object úì ‘rope,’ CS a is optional in per-
fect and imperfect aspect.8 For a transitive verb, lexical meaning implies but does
not entail a telic change of maximal extent. Verb plus CS a predications confirm the
implication of maximal extent in perfect and imperfect aspect.(103) a. ólí ómòhè híán       ólí úì.
         the man PRP.cut the rope
         ‘The man cut the rope.’

         the man SC C cut the rope CS
         ‘The man is cutting the rope off.’Intransitive pattern two verbs occur only in the perfect with CS a. Under bare predi-
cate conditions they fail with Factative suffix -i. In addition, they do not occur in the
imperfect even with CS a.(104) a. ólí úì     híán     á' / *híán-ì.

Pattern three verbs denote a lexical meaning that implies but does not entail a telic
or maximal extent change of state. Verb plus CS a predications in the perfect, how-
ever, confirm actualization of a telic end state. CS a and confirmative pattern three
verbs constrain aspect and transitivity. In the perfect, they optionally take CS a, but
in the imperfect they reject CS a. Transitive guogho, for example, optionally takes CS
a in the perfect but not in the imperfect.(109) a. òjè gúóghó      ólí úkpóràn á.

verbs that are exclusively intransitive or exclusively transitive. Although these pred-
ications take perfect or prospective aspect, none exhibits an intransitive predication
with CS a that exclusively takes imperfect aspect.

Complex predicates consisting of Change of State (CS) particle a or Change of Loca-
tion (CL) particle o and either of the verbs fi or ku in series express meanings bearing
on object release. They convey change of spatial location that is projected (PCL) or

rial state that is extended (ECMS), or state change that is extended (ES). In each, the
subject or direct object referent releases through space, ballistically propelled by
force (PCL) or nonballistically extends through space in a continuous motion (ECL),
extends across a continuous space of change of state (ECPS/ECMS), or extends
across a state (ES). These are summarized in Table 5.","[557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585]"
"10.1 Comitative of action
Complex predicates that are transitive or intransitive identify a comitative relation
(Blake 2001) with kpaye (kpaa for some speakers) ‘accompany, move with’ as V1.
Comitative and subject participants co-locate to undertake an event. V2 consists of
activity verbs that are intransitive, e.g. dan ‘wrestle’ or vbaye ‘chat,’ or transitive,
e.g. ta ‘speak’ or sume ‘struggle over.’ Predication sense is ‘do with, together.’

    the man SC C accompany her do

ceptable.(6) *ólí áwá kpáyé'           òhí dán.
    the dog PAP.accompany Ohi wrestle

       ‘The child is playing by himself.’    Complex predications with comitative kpaye do not deconstruct strictly as sim-
ple verbs, although there seems to be NP1 sharing. V2 dan or vbaye occur as simple
predicates but not with singular NP1 as subject. Both dan and vbaye require a plural
grammatical subject. V2 sie takes singular or plural subjects.(10) a. élí ímòhè / *ólí ómòhè ò ó dán.

604 | Participant expressing complex predicatesAs a simple predicate, V1 kpaye only occurs with a direct object framed as an obliga-
tory external possession phrase, where a human noun possessor precedes a posses-
sum (Chapter 4,4.3.3.1). Possessum is restricted to the body-part term óbò ‘hand.’
And predication sense is ‘help, assist, give a helping hand,’ which appears derived
idiomatically from ‘accompany someone’s hand.’(12) òjè kpáyé              áléké óbò.

     ‘Oje helped Aleke. / Oje gave Aleke a helping hand.’    Complex predications with comitative kpaye reveal additional properties in
constructions expressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and
mood as well as argument repositioning in discourse. Relative to aspect, complex
kpaye predications show variable patterns. For instance, predications with kpaye
vbaye inflect for imperfect Continuous but not Present or Past perfect.(13) ólí ómòhè ò ó kpàyè           mé vbàyé.

Complex predicates that are transitive and convey change of state express a substi-
tutive relation (Blake 2001) with kpaye (kpaa for some speakers) ‘replace’ as V1.
kpaye subject (ólí ómóhé ‘the man’) specifies an event participant that substitutes
for kpaye direct object (òlólò ‘Ololo’). V2 consists of transitive verbs such as e ‘eat’ or
hian ‘cut.’ Predication sense is ‘replace, do in place of, in lieu of, instead of.’(19) a. ójé kpáyé'         òlólò é ólí émàè.
        Oje PAP.replace Ololo eat the food

        Oje PAP.replace Ololo cut the wood

but rejects stative ri ‘be located.’

larly, NP2 position requires a human noun. Nonhuman animates are unacceptable.(21) a.*ólí áwá kpáyé'          òhí é ólí émàè.

     who the man PAP.replace eat the food
     ‘Whom did the man replace and eat the food?’This same NP2 position with kpaye accepts accusative pronouns (óì ‘him) but not
reflexive pronouns (ègbé óí) or dative pronouns (áìn ‘him’).(23) a. ólí ómóhé kpáyé'           óì / *áìn é ólí émàè.

hian ólí óràn) appear as predicates with NP2 or NP1 as subject.(24) a. ólí ómòhè / òlólò é          ólí émàè.

ment repositioning in discourse. Complex substitutive predications do not constrain

Complex predicates convey a sociative relation (Blake 2001) with de baa ‘join’ as V1.
The sociative participant joins and accompanies other event participants. V2 con-
sists of activity verbs that are intransitive (e.g. sie ‘play’) or transitive (e.g. sua ìmátò
‘push car’). Predication sense is ‘do with, together, join and do.’(32) a. ólí ómó dé'          báá ínyó      óì síé.

Complex predicates articulate a comitative relation (Blake 2001) for posture and
position change events with V1 kpeen ‘support, prop up, wedge in.’ Participants
spatially co-locate. V1 consists of intransitive posture verbs, e.g. muzan ‘stand,’ dia
‘sit,’ and mehen ‘lie,’ or transitive verbs of object manipulation, e.g. nwu ‘take hold’
or fi ‘leave.’ Predication sense is ‘be with, alongside, by.’(47) a. òjè múzán         kpéén òlólò.

          ‘Oje did it with Ololo.’     Participants encoded by noun phrases in kpeen predications co-locate (intransi-
tive NP1 and NP2 or transitive NP2 and NP3). Comitative kpeen complements, wheth-
er intransitive NP2 or transitive NP3, require human noun direct objects. Nonhuman,
animate nouns (éwè) are unacceptable.

      ‘The goat stood with Oje.’    Complex predications with comitative kpeen do not deconstruct strictly as sim-
ple verbs, although they share NP1. V1 muzan appears as an intransitive with NP1 as
subject but not as a transitive verb with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object.(53) òjè múzán-ì.    /     *òjè múzán       òlólò.

Complex predicates with transitive verb re ‘take/use’ in series mark the semantic
relations instrument, means, stimulus or durative time. Assignment of a particular
relation correlates in large measure with event verb type: instrument with change of
state, means with activity, stimulus with cognition, and temporal duration with
prolonged activity verbs, as illustrated immediately below.(62) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ré          údò gbé ákhè á.

ment participants serve as immediate cause of a change of state expressed by V2
that affects NP3. Predication sense is ‘take, use, do with.’(63) a. òjè ré        údò gbé ákhè á.

tive inanimate nouns (e.g. àmè ‘water’)4 as re direct object are unacceptable, espe-
cially when compared to active ingredient nouns (e.g. ósà ‘soap,’ ósòkòtò ‘soda

V1, complex predicates express event temporal duration. V2 consists of verbs realiz-
ing state, activity or change of state. Predication sense is ‘take, use.’(104) a. ólí ómóhé ré'        ólí éghé méhén.

       Oje PAP.take day       three do it
       ‘Oje used three days to do it.’     Noun phrase positions in temporal re predications exhibit distinctive properties.
NP2 position permits nominals headed by íkpédè (derived from édè ‘day’) or éghè
‘time.’ Each of these nominals is further restricted. NP2 disallows further elaboration
of íkpédè phrases by relational nouns such as ékéín ‘within’ (cf. temporal bounding
adverbials) or of éghè phrases by postnominal modifiers.(106) a. ó ré'          í kpédè èéà    kónó èfó.

Complex predicates articulate a goal relation (Blake 2001) with gbe ‘hit’ as V2 in
series. This relation requires forceful contact of a moving entity with a stationary
object. V1 position accepts transitive and intransitive verbs of motion or causation.
Predication sense is ‘hit, against.’(116) a. òjè gbúlú      ólí ókò     gbé ìmátò.
         Oje PRP.roll the mortar hit car
         ‘Oje rolled the mortar against the car.’

       Oje PRP.do it hit car
       ‘Oje did it against the car.’Noun phrase positions in contactive gbe predications show distinctive properties.

subject and a musical instrument direct object, gbe has the sense ‘beat, strike, play,
hit.’ gbe does not express sense ‘beat, hit’ with inanimate direct objects that serve as
NP3 in complex predications.(123) a. ólí ómòhè gbé            ólì ìbè.

      the man SC C beat the youth
      ‘The man is beating / hitting the youth.’In series, re and direct object òè ‘leg’ join gbe to express contactive ‘kick.’(125) ólí óvbékhán ré'       òè gbé ìbóòlù.
      the youth     PAP.use leg hit ball
      ‘The youth kicked the ball with his leg.’With plural body-part ábò ‘hands’ as direct object, gbe conveys sense ‘clap.’(126) òjè ò ó gbè ábò.
      Oje SC C hit hands
      ‘Oje is clapping his hands.’    Complex predications with contactive gbe reveal additional properties when
conveying aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument
repositioning in discourse. Relative to aspect, contactive gbe is constrained by V1.

course. Equally, predications with a human noun as NP3 allow their subject and
direct object position to correspond to a focus position constituent.(133) a. ólí ókpósó nà lí ó fí'               úkpóràn gbé òjè.

Complex predicates specify a comparative relation with lee ‘surpass’ in series as V2.
Participants marked by lee serve as a standard of comparison along some dimension
for the subject participant. V1 consists of transitive or intransitive verbs whose sca-
lar conditions can be identified for comparison. Predication sense is ‘more than.’(134) a. ólí ómòhè ón            àmè léé     mè.
         the man PRP.drink water surpass me
         ‘The man drank more water than I.’

        Afuze PAP.be.far surpass Oke
        ‘Afuze is farther than Oke.’As well, V1 position in complex comparative predications does not accept copula
forms such as vbi ‘be’ or intransitive directional motion verbs such as o ‘enter.’(135) a. *ólí ómòhè vbì       ònwìmè léé       òhí.

       Oje PAP.do it surpass Aleke
       ‘Oje did more than Aleke.’     Noun phrase positions in lee predications exhibit distinctive properties. De-
pending on V1 transitivity, NP1 subject is measured against intransitive NP2 or tran-
sitive NP3. Illustrating with intransitives, lee marked NP2 position accepts animate
(òhí), inanimate (éànmì) or locative (íwé) nouns.(137) a. òlólò dá            léé       òhí.

         house my PRP.be.big surpass house ASS your
         ‘My house is bigger than your house.’Intransitive NP2 position marked by lee can be ellipted in a sufficiently rich context,

restrict aspect. They inflect for Past and Present perfect or imperfect Habitual but
not imperfect Continuous.

          ‘It was Aleke alone that Oje drank more water than.’10.8 Ablative
Complex predicates specify an ablative relation (Blake 2001) with V2 in series shoo
re/re and its locative vbi complement. shoo vbi re/vbi re marked referents express
location and distance from which an entity is removed. V1 consists of object manip-
ulation verbs such as nwu ‘take’ that are compatible with extraction and removal of
a direct object participant. Predication sense is ‘remove from, away from, out of, off
of,’ depending on V2 form.(152) a. òjè nwú      ólì èkpà shóó vbì ìtébù ré.
         Oje PRP.take the bag exit LOC table arrive
         ‘Oje removed the bag away from the table.’
      b. òjè nwú      ólì èkpà vbì ìtébù ré.
         Oje PRP.take the bag LOC table arrive
         ‘Oje removed the bag from the table.’Via its V2 form, ablative predications convey degree of distance moved by NP2 rela-
tive to NP3. When V2 position is assumed by shoo vbi re, distance removed is con-
strued as distal relative to the proximal relation that obtains when V2 position is
held by vbi re. Ablative predications fail when re does not occur as part of V2.(153) a. ólí ómòhè yí         àbà shóó vbì òtòì       ré.
         the man PRP.pull pin exit LOC ground arrive
         ‘The man pulled a pin away from the ground.’

        the woman PRP.collect peelings exit LOC yam arrive
        ‘The woman removed the peelings away from the yam.’
     d. ólì òkpòsò líé           ìkùkù    vbí émà ré.
        the woman PRP.collect peelings LOC yam arrive
        ‘The woman removed the peelings from the yam.’Ablative predications with shoo re fail with pro-verb u ‘do’ as V1.(154)*òjè ú       óì shóó vbì ìtébù ré.
      Oje PRP.do it exit LOC table arrive
      ‘Oje removed it from the table.’    Noun phrase positions in shoo vbi re predications are constrained. As vbi com-
plement in ablative predications, NP3 accepts the nondeictic locative pronoun o but
not deictic locative pronouns (e.g. èàn, èvbò).(155) òjè nwú       ólì èkpà shóó vbì ò /*èàn / *èvbò ré.
      Oje PRP.take the bag exit LOC it here yonder arrive
      ‘Oje removed the bag from it.’NP3 in ablative predications accepts inanimate nouns construed as locations. It does
not accept animate or human nouns.(156) *òjè nwú       ólì èkpà shóó vbì èsí / àlèkè ré.
       Oje PRP.take the bag exit LOC horse Aleke arrive
       ‘Oje removed the bag from the horse / Aleke.’Information questions corresponding to NP3 utilize a proximal V2 re phrase. The
interrogative pronoun for NP3 is ébé' ‘where,’ provided its following clause shows za
‘be located’ in series with V1 and re, not V1 and shoo re.(157) ébé' ójé zá'         nwú ólì èkpà ré    / *shóó ólì èkpà ré?
      where Oje PAP.be.loc take the bag arrive exit the bag arrive
      ‘Where did Oje remove the bag from?’    Complex shoo vbi re predicates fail to deconstruct strictly. As a simple verb, V1
accepts NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object.
640 | Participant expressing complex predicates(158) òjè nwú        ólì èkpà.
      Oje PRP.take the bag
      ‘Oje carried the bag.’V2 shoo vbi re takes NP1 as subject and NP3 as locative complement, although in the
ablative construction it is NP2 not NP1 that undergoes repositioning. shoo vbi re fails
to accept NP2 as subject with NP3 as locative complement.(159) òjè / *ólì èkpà shóó      vbì ìtébù ré.
      Oje the bag PRP.exit LOC table arrive
      ‘Oje left / moved away from the table.’As a synchronic predicate, shoo re takes a locative vbi complement to express the
sense ‘exit, leave.’ Neither shoo nor re alone is sufficient to convey this meaning.(160) òjè shóó       vbí úkpódè ré.
      Oje PRP.exit LOC road     arrive
      ‘Oje exited the road.’    Complex shoo vbi re ablatives reveal further properties when conveying aspect,
aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument repositioning in
discourse. Complex ablative predications do not limit aspect. Regardless of shoo
inclusion, they inflect for Present and Past perfect as well as Continuous.(161) a. ólí ómòhè yí          àbà (shóó) vbì òtòì      ré.

         ‘Did the man pull the pin from the ground?’In discourse, ablative shoo re predications allow argument repositioning with some
conditions. Subject and direct object of V1 correspond to focus position. However,
complement of vbi corresponds to focus only when the matrix clause shows verb za
‘be located’ in series, neither shoo re nor re occurs, and focus position displays em-
phatic marking, e.g. ótóí vbì èvbò rather than simple òtòì.(165) a. òjè lí ó yí'            ólì àbà vbì òtòì       ré.

642 | Participant expressing complex predicates10.9 Allative
Complex predicates express an allative relation with V2 ye ‘move to, toward’ and its
direct object in series. Allative direct objects are recipients of possession transfer
construed as temporary. They contrast with permanent transfer Applicative li/ni
predications (Chapter 9, 9.1). V1 in allative ye predications accepts object manipula-
tion verbs fi ‘throw,’ chie ‘return,’ nwu ‘take hold’ or roo ‘pick out,’ among others.
Predication sense highlights ‘do to/for.’(166) a. ólí ómòhè fí            úkpóràn yé        òhí.

       Oje PRP.do it move.to the farmer

       the woman PRP.sell yam move.to farmer
       ‘The woman sold yam to a farmer.’     The noun phrase position subcategorized by ye in allative predications is re-
stricted. NP3 nominals in complex ye predications accept only human nouns. Non-
human animate nouns (éwè ‘goat’) are unacceptable.
                                                                    Allative | 643(169) ólì òkpòsò nwú      émà yé        ònwìmè / *éwè.

Complex predicates represent an addressee relation with V2 vbiee ‘show’ and its
human noun direct object. vbiee predications express unidirectional information
transfer from speaker to vbiee marked addressee. Predication sense assumes neither
a bidirectional verbal exchange between speaker and hearer nor a transfer of infor-
mation by vocal means. V1 consists of a variety of transitive verbs of information
transfer. Predication sense is akin to English ‘express to.’(181) a. ólì òkpòsò kpé          ìtàn    vbíéé ólí ómòhè.

       the woman the secret PRP.show the man
       ‘The woman / secret showed the man.’As a simple predicate, vbiee manifests two senses relative to information transfer:
instructional ‘teach’ and demonstrative ‘show.’ With a double object complement
whose first object is a human noun, vbiee expresses ‘teach.’ Neither object position
alone is sufficient as vbiee complement.(190) àlèkè vbíéé       ólí ómóhé ìsóòmù.
      Aleke PRP.teach the man arithmetic
      ‘Aleke taught the man arithmetic / taught arithmetic to the man.’Object positions following double object vbiee accept contrasting pro-forms. First
object allows an accusative pronoun (óì), second object permits only the quasi-
placeholder noun émì ‘thing,’ not an accusative pronoun.

      the woman PRP.take it show him
      ‘The woman showed it to him.’    Complex predications with vbiee also express sentence aspect, aspectual inter-
rogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument repositioning. With aspect, vbiee
predications reveal V1 derived restrictions. With V1 ze ‘disclose’ among others, vbiee
predications inflect for Past and Present perfect and imperfect Continuous.(194) a. ólí ókpósó zé'            èín    vbíéé ólí ómòhè.

650 | Participant expressing complex predicates10.11 Bidirectional communication addressee
Complex predicates articulate an addressee relation with V2 ree ‘take after’ and its
direct object in series. An event participant marked by ree serves as addressee of a
reciprocal, bidirectional transfer of communication that assumes a forthcoming
reply. ree predications accept only ye ‘send’ in V1 position followed by a human
noun or the noun úhùnmì ‘message.’ Predication sense is ‘send after.’(200) a. ólí ómòhè yé         óvbèkhàn réé           ólì òkpòsò.
         the man PRP.send youth           take.after the woman
         ‘The man sent a youth after the woman.’
      b. ólí ómòhè yé         úhùnmì réé           ólì òkpòsò.
         the man PRP.send message take.after the woman
         ‘The man sent a message after the woman.’V1 position in bidirectional ree predications does not accept pro-verb u ‘do.’(201) *ólí ómòhè ú          óì réé       ólì òkpòsò.
       the man PRP.do it take.after the woman
       ‘The man did it after the woman.’Complex ye ree predicates contrast with complex ye ye predicates. The latter express
a communication transfer that carries no expectation of a reply.(202) a. ólí ómòhè yé         óvbèkhàn yé        ólì òkpòsò.
         the man PRP.send youth          move.to the woman
         ‘The man sent a youth to the woman.’
      b. ólí ómòhè yé         úhùnmì yé         ólì òkpòsò.
         the man PRP.send message move.to the woman
         ‘The man sent a message to the woman.’     Noun phrase positions in complex ree predicates are constrained. NP3 as direct
object of ree accepts only human nouns. It takes neither headless associative
phrases with human noun possessors (ésì ólì òkpòsò) that convey place (assuming
ellipted ìwè ‘house’ for example) nor proper nouns of place (e.g. áfúzé').(203) *òjè yé         óvbèkhàn réé           ésì ólì òkpòsò / áfúzé'.
       Oje PRP.send youth         take.after ASS the woman Afuze
       ‘Oje sent a youth after the woman’s place / Afuze.’NP3 position following ree accepts pronouns for accusative (óì) but not dative (áìn).

      who the man PAP.send the youth          take.after
      ‘Whom did the man send the youth after?’As for NP2 in ye ree predications, it also accepts accusative pronouns.(206) ólí ómòhè yé            óì réé     ólì òkpòsò.
      the man PRP.send it take.after the woman
      ‘The man sent it after the woman.’    Complex predicates with ree do not deconstruct strictly as simple verbs. They do
not share NP1. V1 ye appears as a simple predicate with NP1 as subject and NP2 as
direct object, provided NP2 is a human noun (óvbèkhàn). The metonymic noun
úhùnmì as direct object in simple ye predications is unacceptable.(207) ólí ómòhè yé         óvbèkhàn / *úhùnmì.
      the man PRP.send youth           message
      ‘The man sent a youth.’V2 ree does not accept NP1 or NP2 as subject and NP3 as direct object, even when NP3
is a human noun.(208) a. *ólí ómòhè / óvbèkhàn réé              ólì òkpòsò.
          the man      youth     PRP.take.after the woman
          ‘The man / youth took after the woman.’
      b. *ólí úhùnmì réé               ólì òkpòsò.
          the message PRP.take.after the woman
          ‘The message took after the woman.’As a simple predicate, intransitive ree followed by bí ‘like’ conveys a judgment of
physical resemblance. ree as a simple transitive verb does not convey resemblance.7(209) ólí óvbèkhàn réè             bí érá       óì.

      ‘The youth physically resembles / takes after his father.’

ties when expressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood

Complex predicates express an addressee relation bearing on unidirectional com-
munication with V2 ye and its direct object in series. Event participants marked by
ye serve as message goal, with no expectation of a reply, contrary to ye ree predica-
tions, which expect a reply. V1 accepts only ye ‘send.’ Predication sense is ‘send to.’

Complex predicates show deictic motion verbs in the expression of locative goal
relations. Two verbs differentiated by aspect are involved. Deictic verbs vare ‘came,
will come’ or vade ‘comes, coming’ each take a locative vbì complement as V2 in
series. A third deictic verb lode ‘go’ appears only as a simple predicate. It fails to
occur in complex predicates.(235) a. ólì òkpòsò váré vbì ìwè.

         ‘The woman went to the house / home.’10.13.1 Deictic goal vareComplex predicates specify a deictic goal relation with V2 vare ‘came, will come’ and
its locative vbi complement in perfect or prospective aspect. Locatives in vare predi-
cations coincide with speaker location. Event motion is directed toward the speaker

tive (e.g. sua ‘push,’ fioo ‘blow,’ nwu ‘take/carry’) or intransitive (e.g. la ‘run’). Pred-
ication sense is ‘move to speaker or reference point.’(236) a. òjè nwú        ólì èkpà váré vbí ékóà.

Transitive V1 occurs with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object. Intransitive V1
occurs with NP1 as subject. Verbs with natural force subjects, i.e. fioo ‘blow,’ fail to
occur as simple transitive predicates.(239) a. òjè nwú        ólì èkpà.

to a locative reference point and the speaker. Motion is toward the reference point
and speaker when vbi follows vare. However, motion is from the reference point and
toward an assumed, unstated speaker position when vbi phrase and verb za ‘be at’
in series precede vare. Speaker position in za constructions is distinct from the vbi
reference point. In addition, vare disallows combined ‘from to’ phrases.(242) a. òjè váré       vbì ìwè.

Transitive V1 nwu occurs as a simple predicate with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct
object. Intransitive V1 la occurs as a simple predicate with NP1 as subject. Transitive
V1 (fioo), with its force noun as NP1 subject and its NP2 direct object, fails as simple

relative to a locative reference point and speaker. Motion is toward reference point
and speaker when vbi follows vade. However, it is from reference point and toward
an assumed, unstated speaker position when vbi phrase and verb za in series pre-
cede vade. Speaker position in za constructions is assumed to be distinct from vbi
marked reference point. In addition, vade disallows syntactic expression of com-
bined ‘from to’ phrases.(257) a. òjè vádé vbí édà.

pressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as
argument repositioning in discourse. Complex vade predications restrict aspect.
They do not inflect for Past and Present perfect. They also do not inflect with Con-

predications. As a simple predicate, lode takes a following vbi phrase complement.
It never occurs with a preceding vbi phrase and verb za ‘be located’ in series. lode
expresses direction of motion relative to a locative reference point and speaker.
Motion is toward the reference point and away from the speaker. Speaker position in
lode predications is assumed to be distinct from locative reference point. Moreover,
combining za and lode to express a source goal construction is disallowed.(265) a. òjè lòdé vbí íwé.

liquid, natural force or inanimate subjects. It also does not allow nouns referring to

       where Oje be.loc go
       ‘Where does Oje go?’    Simple predications with deictic lode disclose additional properties in construc-
tions conveying sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as
well as argument repositioning in discourse. Simple lode predications limit aspect.

ed’ and its locative vbi complement as V1 in series. V2 consists of either ye ‘move
toward,’ se ‘move as far as/ reach’ or de re ‘fall to.’ Predication sense is ‘from loca-
tion X to location Y.’
     Source-Goal (SG) predications differentially articulate horizontal and vertical
motion as well as spatial and temporal extent. Motion on the horizontal plane with
no expression of manner is conveyed by za in series with ye. za and its complement
must precede ye and its complement, as is the case with all SG predications. A rever-
sal in the order of these verb phrases, i.e. goal then source, is unacceptable.(274) ólí ómòhè zá        vbí áfúzé' yé    òkè.
      the man PRP.be.loc LOC Afuze move.to Oke
      ‘The man moved from Afuze to Oke.’To express manner of motion from source to goal on the horizontal plane, za occurs
in series with verb se and a manner verb (e.g. transitive sua ‘push,’ fioo ‘blow,’ in-
transitive la ‘run’). The manner verb follows za but precedes se.(275) a. ójé zá'         vbí áfúzé' súá ìmátò sé  vbì òkè.

      the man PRP.be.loc LOC top             tree fall ground arrive
      ‘The man fell from a tree to the ground / to the ground from a tree.’For the expression of spatial and temporal extent situations, za and its complement
precede se and its complement.(277) ótóí mè zá             vbí áfúzé' sé    vbì òkè.
      land my PRP.be.loc LOC Afuze reach LOC Oke
      ‘My land reaches / stretches from Afuze to Oke.’To add a physical dimension (e.g. gba ‘be big’) to spatial extent, za and se occur in
series, with gba positioned either immediately before se or immediately before za.(278) a. ólì òtòì zá            vbì ààn gbá sé         vbì èvbò.

         the land PRP.be.big be.loc LOC here reach LOC yonder
         ‘The land is big / broad from here to there.’Extent of a temporal nature from source time to goal time is formed with za in series
with se and an intervening activity verb like gbe ‘dance.’ In these predications, gbe
cannot precede za.(279) ó zá'         vbí égbíà      gbé sé   vbí énwáà.
      he PAP.be.loc LOC morning dance reach LOC evening
      ‘He danced from morning to evening.’As indicated above, noun phrases serving as vbi complements in SG constructions
accept place or temporal nouns. With a human (ójé) or animate noun as reference
point, syntactic elaboration is required. For example, source and goal can each
show a pronominally headed relative clause framed by ri ‘be located.’

  In addition, it is important to recognize that not every participant in a serial verb construction
serves as an event argument, where argument refers to a relation entailed by an event. This seems
particularly the case with substitutive, comitative and sociative participant roles that follow V1 in
serial verb constructions and the comparative participant role that occurs as V2 in series.","[627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697]"
"8.2.2 Age construction u / vbiIn age constructions, the forms u and vbi occur in complementary distribution or
they alternate freely. This alternation reminds one of the nominal classifying copula
u/vbi (Chapter 8, 8.1.3). However, the copula form does not allow deontic and epis-
temic modality auxiliary forms. Age constructions do. Emai age constructions thus
employ transitive u ‘do’ where English relies on ‘be.’(102) a. ú ló        vbì / ù íkpè ìíhéén ákhò.

lèsèn ‘well,’ ìyó ‘that way’ or ìná ‘this way,’ it contributes to construction sense ‘act,
behave, perform.’ Noun phrase and verb phrase properties in intransitive u con-
structions are partially constrained. It is the case, however, that intransitive u shows
polarity and mood potential and allows discourse repositioning of its arguments.(104) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ú          lèsèn.

èvèvá ú' ìyó [two both PAP.do DMD] ‘Two / Both acted that way’). Cardinal forms
also appear as head of partitive phrases (èvá vbí élí ívbékhán ú' ìyó [two LOC the
youths PAP.do DMD] ‘Two of the youths acted that way’, úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló shèn ú
ìyó [one LOC ones one PRED sell PRP.do DMD] ‘One of the ones that will be sold
468 | Be, do, happen and haveacted that way’). However, intransitive u subject rejects kindred pronouns élìyó and
ódàn.
    Intransitive u subject and adjunct positions correspond to constituents in dis-
course defined positions. Subject corresponds to a focus li/ni or a topic constituent.(107) a. ólí ómòhè lí ó ú'            ìyó.

         ‘It was the man who acted that way.’

         the man he PRP.do DMD
         ‘As for the man, he acted that way.’Manner adjuncts with intransitive u occupy focus position provided Manner preverb
i/e precedes u in the matrix clause. Intransitive u manner-demonstrative adjuncts
never assume topic position.(108) ìyó lí ólí ómóhé í'             ù.
      DMD PF the man PAP.MAN do
      ‘It was that way that the man acted.’Intransitive u grammatical positions correspond to distinct interrogative pronouns.
Subjects correspond only to interrogative pronoun óé'. Adjuncts correspond to
manner questions framed by ébé'...i. Responses require a manner constituent in situ,
not in focus position.(109) a. óé' ó ú'         ìyó?
         who he PAP.do DMD
         ‘Who acted that way?’
      b. ébé' ólí ómóhé í'         ú?

         he PAP.behave DMD
         ‘He behaved that way.’     Intransitive u constructions with manner demonstrative adjuncts restrain the
expression of verb phrase properties. Although intransitive u disallows verbal affix-
es, it selectively occurs with inflection, auxiliary, preverb, postverbal particle and
temporal adjunct categories. Relative to verbal affixes, intransitive u accepts neither
Perseverative Ci-, Factative -i nor Distributive -lo/lo/no (*élí ímòhè ú-ló ìyó [the men
PRP.do-DS DMD] ‘The men each acted that way’).
                                                                     ‘do’ verbs | 469     Intransitive u with manner demonstratives inflects for Past and Present perfect,
imperfect Habitual and Continuous as well as prospective Predictive. It rejects pro-
spective Anticipative (*ólí ómóhè ló ù ìná [the man ANTI do PMD] ‘The man is about

      e. ólí ómóhé ló       ù ìyó.
         the man PRED do DMD
         ‘The man will act that way.’     Intransitive u constructions limit auxiliaries. They permit deontic Hortative (ò í
ù ìná [he HOR do PMD] ‘He should perform this way’) and epistemic Hypothetical
kha (ó khà ú ìyó [he PAP.HYP act DMD] ‘He would have acted that way’), Concessive
rere (ó ré'rè ú ìyó? [he PAP.CONC do DMD] ‘Did he even act that way?’), Deductive za
(ò záà ú ìná [he PRP.DED act PMD] ‘He must have acted this way’) and Resultative za
(ó zá' ú ìyó [he PAP.RES act DMD] ‘As a result, he acted that way’). No other epistem-
ic forms occur, particularly speculative Dubitatives vba and bia, and Certaintive ma.
     In a more severe fashion, intransitive u restrains relative tense. It rejects Subse-
quent kpe, and Anterior ke, as unacceptable ke suggests (*ó ké' ú ìyó [he PAP.ANT
do DMD] ‘He acted that way afterward’).
     Intransitive u limits preverbs. It disallows manner-demonstrative preverbs ìná
and ìyó. With aspectualizers, intransitive u permits some phasal forms, permitting
Repetitive che (ò chéè ú ìyó [he PRP.REP do DMD] ‘He acted that way again’) and
Additive gbo (ò gbóò ú ìyó [he PRP.ADD do DMD] ‘He acted that way too’) but not
Durative se or Punctual ghe. Intransitive u allows only the boundary aspectualizer
Past Absolute ya (ólí ómóhé yà ú ìyó [the man PAP.PA do DMD] ‘The man used to act
that way’). It rejects Past Absolute mo, Ingressive ya, Egressive mo and Conative òó.
     Intransitive u admits only one evaluative preverb, kuku (ólí ómóhé kú'kù ú ìyó
[the man PAP.POEV do DMD] ‘The man afterall acted that way’). It rejects duu ‘for no
reason’ and woo ‘instead.’
470 | Be, do, happen and have     Relative to remaining preverbs, intransitive u accepts only a few. It allows one
temporal preverb, kpao (ólí ómóhé kpá'ò ú ìyó [man PAP.earlier do DMD] ‘The man
acted that way earlier on’), and two subject attributive forms, dóbo (ólí ómóhé dó'bò
ú ìyó [the man PAP.mistakenly do DMD] ‘The man mistakenly acted that way’) and
gbúdu (ólí ómóhé gbú'dù ú ìyó [the man PAP.courageously do DMD] ‘The man coura-
geously acted that way’). It disallows temporal bobo ‘promptly,’ tua ‘hurriedly’ and
gue ‘unexpectedly’ as well as subject attributives dábo ‘deliberately,’ miti ‘able,’
dúda ‘defiantly,’ kekégbe ‘perseveringly,’ dégbe ‘carefully,’ and totóbo ‘intensely.’
     Intransitive u restricts quantity preverbs as well. It accepts Emphatic Reflexive
dobo (ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì ú ìyó [the man PAP.REFL him do DMD] ‘The man himself
acted that way’) and Collective gba (élí ímóhé gbá' ú ìyó [the men PAP.COL do DMD]
‘The men together acted that way’). However, intransitive u rejects Absolute Intensi-
fier zemi and Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze.
     Relative to postverbal forms, intransitive u constructions are generally more tol-
erant. Intransitive u permits a temporal particle as well as deictic adverbs. It allows
Temporal Perspective lee but not Temporal Degree gbe (ólí ókpósó ú' ìyó léé / *gbé
[the woman PAP.do DMD TEMP much] ‘The woman acted that way already / fin-
ished acting that way’). With appropriate inflection, intransitive u accepts deictic
adjuncts for past (òdè), recent past (èghéènà), future (ákhò), immediate present
(ènyáà) and, with adjunct modification, ‘today’ (éènà).(111) a. ólí ókpósó ú'        ìyó òdè.

properties that refer to event intensity or sound. Ideophonic forms thus appear to
ascribe a property to an event rather than to a nominal referent. Constructions de-
fined by u and ideophones inflect only for Past perfect.(112) a. ólí ákhé ú'          bèkhé.
         the pot PAP.do waveringly
         ‘The pot wavered / behaved in a wavering fashion.’

      e. ólí órán ú'         gbó.
         the tree PAP.do thud.sound
         ‘The tree thudded / did a thud.’Information questions corresponding to u ideophone subjects are framed by émé'
‘what.’ Responses require the subject in situ, not as a simple noun phrase.(113) émé' ó ú'        bìán?
      what it PAP.do flashingly
      ‘What flashed? / What did a flash?’
      ókhúnmí ú'         bìán.
      sky        PAP.do flashingly
      ‘The sky flashed.’8.3 ‘happen’ verbs
The verb u with sense ‘happen’ occurs in transitive and intransitive constructions.
Each construction exhibits highly restricted syntactic patterns.(114) a. émí ósò       í ì     ù        ólí ómòhè.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to the man
         ‘Nothing happened to the man.’
472 | Be, do, happen and have      b. ò kéè         ú,      ó vá'rè.
         it PRP.ANT happen he PAP.come
         ‘After it happened, he came.’8.3.1 Intransitive uIntransitive u ‘happen’ is limited to subordinate clauses and information questions.
It occurs in subordinate ke clauses.(115) ò kéè         ú         wèé,      ólí ókpósó ó'     vbì ìwè.
      it PRP.ANT happen short.time the woman PAP.enter LOC house
      ‘After a bit of time, the woman entered the house.’In information questions, intransitive u is preceded by interrogative pronoun émé'.
The Factative suffix -ì in these constructions is disallowed.(116) émé' ó ú'          / *ú-ì?
      what it PAP.happen    happen-F
      ‘What happened?’Responses to intransitive u ‘happen’ information questions restrict predication type.
They permit change of locative state predicates (de ‘fall’) but not caused change of
state predicates, for example gbe a ‘break’ (*ólí ómòhè gbé ákhè á [the man
PRP.break pot CS] ‘The man broke a pot’) or stative ri ‘be’ (*ólí ómòhè ríì vbí ìwè [the
man PRP.be LOC house] ‘The man is in the house’).(117) émé' ó ú'?
      what it PAP.happen
      ‘What happened?’
      ìtásà lí ó dé'             rè.
      plate PF it PAP.fall arrive
      ‘It is a plate that fell.’8.3.2 Transitive uTransitive u ‘happen’ constructions are syntactically rigid. They require predicate
negation, the noun émì as subject position head and an animate noun as direct ob-
ject. Transitive u ‘happen’ has no corresponding affirmative.
                                                                 ‘happen’ verbs | 473(118) a. émí ósò       í   ì   ù          ólí ómòhè.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to the man
         ‘Nothing happened to the man.’
      b. *émí ósò        ú            ólí ómòhè.
          thing certain PRP.happen.to the man
          ‘Something happened to the man.’Transitive ‘happen’ constructions accept not only Perfect Negation but also Prospec-
tive Negation with kha. Otherwise, they do not inflect for prospective aspect (*émí
ósó ló ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain PRED happen.to the man] ‘Something will happen
to the man’, *émí ósò ló ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain ANTI happen.to the man] ‘Noth-
ing is about to happen to the man’).(119) émí ósò       í khà        ù      ólí ómòhè.
      thing certain SC PRONEG happen.to the man
      ‘Nothing will happen to the man.’    Transitive u ‘happen’ fails to accept any auxiliaries or preverbs, as suggested by
the unacceptability of epistemic Certaintive ma (*émí ósò máà ù ólí ómòhè [thing
certain PRP.CER happen.to the man] ‘Something surely happened to the man’) and
evaluative preverb kuku (*émí ósò kúkù ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain PRP.POEV hap-
pen.to the man] ‘Something after all happened to the man’).
    Transitive ‘happen’ constructions confine the shape of their initial noun phrase.
They require noun émì ‘thing’ modified by existential quantifier ósò. No other post-
determiner is acceptable, i.e. demonstrative, numeral or kindred. As well, transitive
‘happen’ rejects noun émì when modified by an associative phrase, attributive
phrase or relative clause.(120) émí ósò       í ì    ù         ólí ómòhè.
      thing certain SC NEG happen.to the man
      ‘Nothing happened to the man.’Morever, three additional negative properties characterize transitive u’s initial noun
phrase. This position does not accept nominative pronouns. Neither first person
singular/plural (í/má) nor third person (ó, íyàìn) is acceptable. It is therefore primar-
ily word order that identifies subject position in transitive ‘happen’ constructions.(121) *ó / íyàìn ì        ù          ólí ómòhè.
       it     they NEG happen.to the man
       ‘It / They did not happen to the man.’
474 | Be, do, happen and haveThe initial noun phrase with transitive u rejects proper names, common nouns vary-
ing in animacy (òkpòsò, áwà, ópìà) or common nouns with a pre- or postdeterminer.(122) a. *àlèkè / ólì òkpòsò í ì         ù         ólí ómòhè.
          Aleke the woman SC NEG happen.to the man
          ‘Aleke / The woman did not happen to the man.’
      b. *ólí áwà / ópìà       í ì     ù          ólí ómòhè.
          the dog cutlass SC NEG happen.to the man
          ‘The dog / cutlass did not happen to the man.’In addition, the initial nominal position with transitive u does not admit any imper-
sonal pronouns. One does not find, for instance, demonstrative óáìn or kindred élìyó
(*óáìn / élìyó í ì ù ólí ómòhè [that.one that.kind SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘That one
/ That kind of thing did not happen to the man’), numeral èvá or èvèvá (*èvá / èvèvá
í ì ù ólí ómòhè [two both SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘Two / Both did not happen to
the man’) or existential ósò or óvbèé (*ósò / óvbèé í ì ù ólí ómòhè [certain.one anoth-
er.one SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘Nothing / Nothing else happened to the man’).
      As for the nominal position following transitive u ‘happen,’ it is not as restricted
as initial position. It permits a range of NPs and requires their syntactic elaboration.
Post-u noun phrase position accepts accusative pronouns across person and num-
ber categories, and it permits human proper nouns.(123) a. émí ósò       í   ì  ù           óì / mè / vbà.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to him me you
         ‘Nothing happened to him / me / you.’
      b. émí ósò       í ì     ù           àlèkè.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to Aleke
         ‘Nothing happened to Aleke.’As direct object, post-u position allows human (óvbèkhàn) and nonhuman animate
(áwà) nouns designated as definite, by, for example, predeterminer ólí. However, it
disallows inanimate nouns (ópìà). Bare common noun direct objects, regardless of
animacy, are unacceptable (*émí ósò í ì ù ólí ópìà / ópìà [thing certain SC NEG hap-
pen.to the cutlass cutlass] ‘Nothing happened to the / a cutlass’).(124) a. émí ósò       í ì    ù           ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to the youth         youth
         ‘Nothing happened to the youth.’
      b. émí ósò       í ì    ù           ólí áwà / *áwà.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to the dog dog
         ‘Nothing happened to the dog.’
                                                                 ‘happen’ verbs | 475     Direct object position in transitive u constructions accepts some postdetermin-
ers. Allowed are demonstrative deictic nà and áìn (émí ósò í ì ù ólí áwá áìn / ólí áwá
nà [thing certain SC NEG happen.to the dog that the dog this] ‘Nothing happened to
that / this dog’) as well as contrastive nóì (émí ósò í ì ù áwá nóì [thing certain SC NEG
happen.to dog next] ‘Nothing happened to the next dog’), and quantifiers, e.g. uni-
versal collective èrèmé and existential partitive ósò (émí ósò í ì ù áwá èrèmé / áwá
ósò [thing certain SC NEG happen.to dog all dog certain] ‘Nothing happened to all
the dogs / to a certain dog’). Excluded from u direct object position are numerals,
e.g. cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá as well as kindred forms, deictic élìyó and
contrastive ódàn.
     Transitive u direct object position allows most impersonal pronouns: demon-
stratives ònà, óáìn and ónóì, universal quantifiers, collective èrèmé and distributive
òdóòdé, as well as existential quantifiers, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (émí
ósò í ì ù óáìn / ònóì / *èvá / *élìyó [thing certain SC NEG happen.to that.one next.one
two one.that.kind] ‘Nothing happened to that one / the next one’). Rejected in direct
object position are numerals such as cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá and kindred
forms, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn.
     Transitive u ‘happen’ noun phrases allow for repositioning to discourse defined
positions. u subject corresponds to a li/ni focus constituent but not a topic (*émí lí ó
ú' érá íyàìn, ó ló gbò ú íyàìn [thing R it PAP.happen.to father their it PRED ADD hap-
pen.to them] ‘As for the thing that happened to their father, it will happen to them

          PF it PRED ADD happen them
      ‘The thing that happened to their father will also happen to them.’In information questions, transitive u subject corresponds to interrogative pronoun
émé'. Habitual aspect is obligatory in the question. Responses require a verb other
than u inflected for Habitual aspect.(126) émé' ó ò ú             òjè?
      what it H happen.to Oje
      ‘What happens to Oje?’
      ó ò khònmé.
      he H become.sick
      ‘He becomes sick.’
476 | Be, do, happen and haveIn contrast, transitive u direct object corresponds to a topic constituent but not a
focus li/ni constituent (*ólí ómóhé nà lí émí ósò í ì ù [the man this PF thing certain SC
NEG happen.to] ‘It was this man that nothing happened to’). In addition, transitive
u direct objects never correspond to an interrogative pronoun, e.g. óé' in (*óé' émí
ósò í ì ù? [who thing certain SC NEG happen.to] ‘Whom did nothing happen to?’).(127) ólí ómòhè, émí ósò         í ì    ù         óì.
      the man      thing certain SC NEG happen.to him
      ‘As for the man, nothing happened to him.’8.3.3 Intransitive ruanAlong with intransitive u ‘happen,’ Emai has a verb ruan ‘happen.’ It is limited to
intransitive constructions, failing in transitives (*ébè rúán ólí ómòhè ‘A calamity
happened to the man’).(128) ébè       rúán-ì.
      calamity PRP.happen-F
      ‘A calamity happened.’Intransitive ruan occurs in émé' ‘what’ information questions. Responses require
caused change of state (gbe) or change of state (de) verb.(129) émé' ó rúán'-ì?
      what it PAP.happen-F
      ‘What happened?’
      ìmátò gbé         óìà.      /     ólì ùgín dé'-ì.

      ‘A car killed a person.’          ‘The basket fell.’     Intransitive ruan occurs in series with allative verb ye and its human direct ob-
ject, although only in information questions.(130) émé' ó rúán'        yé      ólí ómòhè / *ólí óràn?
      what it PAP.happen move.to the man       the tree
      ‘What happened to the man?’Predicate ruan ye shows information questions with émé' ‘what’ corresponding to
subject position; responses require a change of state verb (u ‘die’).

      ó ú'-ì.
      he PAP.die-F
      ‘He died.’    As a point of comparison, the verbs ruan and u are not interchangeable. ruan
appears limited to calamitous events that are permanent or irreversible, as suggest-
ed by acceptable ruan, not u, with subject noun ébè ‘calamity.’(132) a. ébè       rúán-ì.
         calamity PRP.happen-F

          calamity PRP.happen happen-F
          ‘A calamity happened.’In addition, information questions with ruan and u do not invite equivalent re-
sponses. ruan requires permanent u ‘die’ but not temporary khonme ‘become sick’ as
response. Intransitive u, conversely, requires a temporary, not a permanent event.(133) émé' ó rúán'        yé        ólí óvbèkhàn?

The verb u ‘do’ collocates with direct object nominals to express a variety of cultural
judgments. English translations vary across ‘perform/execute,’ ‘commit/be guilty’ or
478 | Be, do, happen and have‘be engaged/immersed in,’ as the samples below suggest. Each u construction will
be examined briefly for its aspect potential and discourse properties.(135) a. ólí ómòhè ú          émí lì òbè.

         ‘They did / conducted / celebrated a festival already.’8.4.1 u ábòThe sense ‘perform, execute’ arises in constructions where u collocates with direct
object ábò ‘divination’ and an obligatory locative vbi phrase. This construction re-
quires Conative preverb òó. It rejects simple perfect and imperfect aspect.(136) ólí ómòhè ó ó'      ù ábó          vbì òkè.

negative statements, imperatives or prohibitives. They are found as polar questions
(ólí ómòhè ó ó' ù ábó vbì òkè? [the man SC CON do divination LOC Oke] ‘Did the man
go to perform divination in Oke?’).
     Noun phrases in u ábò collocations limit correspondence to discourse defined
positions. Subject position corresponds to a li/ni marked focus constituent, a topic
constituent or an interrogative pronoun (óé'). Neither direct object nor locative ob-
ject exhibit similar grammatical possibilities.(137) a. ólí ómóhé nà lí ó ó' ù ábó                  vbì òkè.

veys the sense ‘provide/give assistance to.’ This construction inflects only for Pre-
sent and Past perfect, never imperfect aspect.(138) a. òjè ú        ìkhòbó     lí    àlèkè.

         Oje PAP.do assistance APP Aleke
         ‘Oje provided assistance to / for Aleke.’u ìkhòbó li takes an instrument argument, accepting transitive re ‘use’ and its direct
object in verb series (òjè ré ólí éghó' ú ìkhòbó lí àlèkè [Oje PRP.use the money do
assistance APP Aleke] ‘Oje used the money to give assistance to Aleke’).
     The u ìkhòbó li collocation does not restrict polarity and mood. It appears as an
imperative (ù ìkhòbó lí òhí [do assistance APP Ohi] ‘Provide assistance for Ohi’),
prohibitive (é è ú ìkhòbó lí àlèkè [you PR do assistance APP Aleke] ‘Don’t provide
assistance for Aleke’), polar interrogative (ójé ú' ìkhòbó lí àlèkè? [Oje PAP.do assis-
tance APP Aleke] ‘Did Oje provide assistance for Aleke?’) and negative statement
480 | Be, do, happen and have(òjè í ì ù ìkhòbó lì àlèkè [Oje SC NEG do assistance APP Aleke] ‘Oje didn’t assist

     Noun phrase positions in u ìkhòbó li collocations do not correspond uniformly
to discourse defined positions. Subject corresponds to topic, li/ni focus or interroga-
tive pronoun, as do indirect objects of Applicative li/ni. However, the noun ìkhòbó
never occurs in focus or topic position or corresponds to an interrogative pronoun.(139) a. òjè, ò ú          ìkhòbó      lí      àlèkè.

the sense ‘perform/execute well on an exam.’(140) ólí ómòhè ú         ólì ìdàmìghé lèsèn.
      the man PRP.do the exam           well
      ‘The man did / performed / executed the exam well.’    Syntactic variants occur with only direct object (ólí ómòhè ú ólì ìdàmìghé [the
man PRP.do the exam] ‘The man did / executed the exam’) or only adjunct (ólí
ómóhé ú' lèsèn [the man PAP.do well] ‘The man did / performed / executed (it)
well’). In addition, there is a semantically related construction where adjunct pre-
cedes erstwhile direct object, which is then marked by preposition vbi (ólí ómòhè ú

formed well on the exam’). A similar variant occurs with ìsìkúù as vbi complement
(áléké ó ò ù lésén vbì ìsìkúù [Alele SC H do well LOC school] ‘Aleke does / performs
well at school’), although there is no alternation with ìsìkúù as direct object (*áléké ó
ò ù ìsìkúù lèsèn [Aleke SC H do school well] Aleke does school well’).
     Collocations with u ìdàmìghé inflect for Past and Present perfect but not imper-
fect Habitual or Continuous. In the Habitual, however, there exists an alternation
where manner adjunct precedes prepositional vbi phrase.(141) a. ólí ómòhè ú        ólì ìdàmìghé lèsèn.
         the man PRP.do the exam          well

         the man SC H do well LOC exam
         ‘The man does / performs / executes well on exams.’     u ìdàmìghé lèsèn limits polarity and mood. It appears as a negative statement
(ólí ómòhè í ì ù ólì ìdàmìghé lèsèn [the man SC NEG do the exam well] ‘The man did
not do / perform well on the exam’) or polar interrogative (ólí ómòhè ú ólì ìdàmìghé
lèsèn? [the man PRP.do the exam well] ‘Did the man perform well on the exam?’).
     Alternation constructions exhibit similar potential for negative statement (ólí
ómòhè í ì ù lésén vbí ólì ìdàmìghé [the man SC NEG do well LOC the exam] ‘The man
did not do / perform well on the exam’) and polar question (ólí ómòhè ú lésén vbí ólì
ìdàmìghé? [the man PRP.do well LOC the exam] ‘Did the man do / perform well on
the exam?’). But u ìdàmìghé lèsèn collocations, alternation type aside, fail as imper-
atives or prohibitives.
     Noun phrases in u ìdàmìghé lèsèn collocations generally correspond to dis-
course defined positions. Subject corresponds to li/ni focus or topic but not to an
interrogative pronoun (óé'). However, subject in syntactically reduced collocations
lacking adjunct lèsèn corresponds to an interrogative pronoun (óé' ó ú' ólì ìdàmìghé?
[who he PAP.do the exam] ‘Who performed the exam?’).(142) a. ólí ómóhé nà òkpá lí ó ú'             ólì ìdàmìghé lèsèn.

li/ni focus or topic constituent. It never corresponds to an interrogative pronoun
(*émé' ó ú' lèsèn? [what he PAP.do well] ‘What did he do well?’, *émé' ó ú'-ì? [what

constitutent (*ébé' ólí ómóhé í' ú ólì ìdàmìghé? [how the man PAP.MAN do the exam]
‘How did the man do on the exam?’).8.4.4 u óhà / u ódònThe verb u collocates with ódòn ‘husband’ or óhà ‘wife’ and either of the adjuncts
chéchéché or lèsèn to convey sense ‘act, behave or perform toward / treat one’s
spouse appropriately.’ These collocations are limited to Habitual aspect.

         she H do husband her well
         ‘She acts toward / performs toward / treats well her husband.’     Collocations with u óhá and u ódòn restrict polarity and mood. In the imperative
they require Ingressive ya (yà ú ódón ó lèsèn [IG do husband your well] ‘Get on with
/ Start treating your husband well’, yà ú ódón ó chéchéché [IG do husband your ap-
propriately] ‘Start acting toward your husband in an appropriate fashion’). They fail
as prohibitives.
     u óhá/ódòn collocations are acceptable as polar interrogatives (áléké ó ò ù ódón

husband?’, áléké ó ò ù ódón óí chéchéché? [Aleke SC H do husband her appropriate-
ly] ‘Does Aleke act toward her husband appropriately?’). But they fail as negatives.
     Noun phrase positions in u óhá/ódòn collocations appear in discourse defined
positions. Subject corresponds to a li/ni focus or topic constituent. It does not corre-
spond to an interrogative pronoun like óé' (*óé' ó ò ù ódón óí chéchéché? [who she H
do husband her appropriately] ‘Who treats her husband appropriately?’).(145) a. àlèkè òkpá lí ó ò ù ódón              óí chéchéché.

         Aleke she H do husband her appropriately

stituent in topic or focus position (*òdón óí lí áléké ó ò ù chéchéché [husband her PF
Aleke SC H do appropriately] ‘It is her husband that Aleke treats appropriately’). As
well, adjuncts in ‘treat’ collocations fail to correspond to an interrogative pronoun
or to assume topic or focus position (*chéchéché lí áléké ó ò ù ódón óì [appropriately
PF Aleke SC H do husband her] ‘It is appropriately that Aleke treats her husband’).
484 | Be, do, happen and have8.4.5 u émíéìmì / u àwààTransitive verb u collocates with evaluative content nouns émíéìmì ‘abomination’

òbè ‘that bad’ appear in monotransitive and double object constructions. Monotran-
488 | Be, do, happen and havesitives have the sense ‘commit a bad thing,’ while double object constructions, with
an affected human noun as first object, have the sense ‘commit something bad
against someone.’(158) a. ólí ómòhè ú         émí lì òbè.

         the man PRP.do me thing R bad
         ‘The man did / committed / is guilty of a bad thing against me.’Noun émì in these collocations requires lì òbè. There is no corresponding construc-
tion that has bare émì (*ólí ómòhè ú émì (lì èsèn) [the man PRP.do thing R good] ‘The
man did something / a good thing’) or émí lì èsèn ‘good thing’ (*ólí ómòhè ú mé émí lì
èsèn [the man PRP.do me thing R good] ‘The man did a good thing to me’). In addi-
tion, double object u émì lì òbè does not alternate with an Applicative li/ni construc-
tion where affected object would assume indirect object position (*ò ú émí lì òbè lí
émè [he PRP.do thing R bad APP me] ‘He did something bad to me’).
    Constructions with u émí lì òbè limit aspect. Monotransitive and double object

òbè is found as a negative statement (ólí ómòhè í ì ù émí lì òbè [the man SC NEG do
thing R bad] ‘The man did not do a bad thing’) but not as a polar question. Double
object u émí lì òbè occurs as neither negative statement (*ólí ómòhè í ì ù mé émí lì òbè

     Noun phrases in monotransitive and double object u émí lì òbè constructions
limit respositioning in discourse. Subject position corresponds to a li/ni focus con-

sponding interrogative pronoun.(161) a. émí lì òbè lí ólí ómóhé ú'-ì.

490 | Be, do, happen and have8.4.7 u èsèn / u òbèThe verb u collocates with a direct object consisting of either evaluative noun èsèn
‘good’ or òbè ‘bad’ modified by the definite predeterminer. Collocations of this type
exhibit limited polarity and mood potential. They appear as negative statements,
never as affirmative statements. The u ólì èsèn and u ólì òbè collocations also never
appear as polar questions, imperatives or prohibitives. In addition, neither u ólì èsèn
nor u ólì òbè inflects for perfect or imperfect aspect.(163) a. ólí ómòhè í ì       ù ólì èsèn.

         the man SC NEG do the bad.one
         ‘The man did not do the bad thing.’     Noun phrase positions in u ólì èsèn and u ólì òbè constructions relate to dis-
course positions in a restricted fashion.18 Subject never corresponds to a li/ni focus
constituent (*ólí ómòhè nà li ó ì ù ólì òbè [the man this PF he NEG do the bad.one] ‘It
was this man who did not do the bad thing’), topic constituent (*ólí ómòhè nà, ó ì ù

thing’) or interrogative pronoun (*óé' ó ì ù ólì èsèn? [who he NEG do the good.one]
‘Who did not do the good thing?’). Direct object position behaves similarly. It never
corresponds to a focus constituent (*ólì èsèn li ólí ómòhè í ì ù [the good.one PF the
man SC NEG do] ‘It was the good thing that the man did not do’), topic constituent
(*ólì èsèn, ólí ómòhè í ì ù óì [the good.one the man SC NEG do it] ‘As for the good

tion to convey situations unwelcome in village life. In these constructions, u in the
Habitual has the sense ‘engage/immerse in.’ Such collocations never appear in per-
fect aspect or imperfect Continuous.(164) a. ólí ókpósó ó ò ù èó.

     d. ójé ó ò ù ìgúó.
        Oje SC H do crookedness
        ‘Oje engages in unsavory acts / in crooked dealings.’     u constructions with sense ‘engage in’ limit polarity and mood. They appear as
prohibitives (é è kè ú èmòì [you PR ANT do gossip] ‘Don't gossip anymore’, é è kè ú
òvbéé' [you PR ANT do intrigues] ‘Don't plan intrigues anymore’) but not as impera-
tives. Constructions with u ‘engage in’ occur as polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó ó ò ù
èó? [the woman SC H do gossip] ‘Is the woman guilty of gossip?’, ójé ó ò ù èmòì? [Oje

èó [the woman SC PANEG do gossip] ‘The woman never gossips’, òjè í yà ù èmòì [Oje
SC PANEG do issues] ‘Oje never gossips’). Negative statements for these construc-
tions require Past Absolute Negation yà.
     Noun phrase positions in u ‘engage in’ constructions differentially restrict their
relations to discourse positions. Subject corresponds to a topic constituent but not a
li/ni focus constituent. In addition, subject corresponds to interrogative pronoun
(óé') in questions with an obligatory partitive vbi phrase (vbí úsèé ísì ìyáín). Even
more limited is direct object, which corresponds to neither interrogative pronoun,
topic constituent nor focus constituent, e.g. (*èó lí ólí ókpósó ó ò ù [gossip PF the
woman SC H do] ‘It was gossip that the woman engaged in’).(165) a. ólí ókpósó nà, ó ò ù èó.

collocation is limited to Continuous aspect, rejecting imperfect Habitual and both
forms of the perfect. The noun phrase following u in this collocation never allows
definite article ólí/élí or any postdeterminer.
492 | Be, do, happen and have(166) òjè ò ó ù àgbòn.
      Oje SC C do life
      ‘Oje is enjoying / engaging in / conducting his life with vigor.’     u àgbòn constructions restrict mood and polarity. They appear as imperatives,
although Ingressive ya is required (yà ú ágbón ísì èé [IG do life ASS your] ‘Get on
with your life / Start living your life’). They never appear as prohibitives, negative
statements or polar questions.
     Noun phrases in u àgbòn constructions restrict repositioning in discourse. Sub-
ject fails to correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent or interrogative
pronoun such as óé' (*óé' ó ò ù àgbòn? [who he H do life] ‘Who is enjoying life?).
Likewise, àgbòn never appears in topic or focus position or corresponds to an inter-
rogative pronoun.8.4.10 u úkpèThe verb u collocates with noun úkpè ‘festival’ to express ‘celebrate or execute a
festival.’ This collocation is restricted to Past and Present perfect and Continuous
imperfect. u úkpè rejects imperfect Habitual.(167) a. áfúzé' ú'       úkpè     léé.

         ‘They have executed a festival already / celebrated already.’Direct object úkpè allows definite article ólí and postdeterminers (è ú ólí úkpè léé
[they PRP.do the festival TEMP] ‘They celebrated / did the festival already’).
    Constructions with u úkpè constrain polarity and mood. They never appear as
imperatives or negative statements. They occur as prohibitives, with obligatory
plural subject (vbá è / *é è kè ú úkpé ísì àgágán' [you PR you PR ANT do festival ASS

sense ‘act or behave in a manly/womanly fashion,’ respectively. Neither noun ac-

ble negatives indicate (*ínyó vbà í ì ù òkpòsò [mother your SC NEG do womanhood]

     Noun phrase positions in u ómòhè/òkpòsò collocations have limited discourse
repositioning potential. Subject does not corefer to an interrogative pronoun, topic
constituent or li/ni focus constituent (*ínyó vbà lí ó ú' òkpòsò [mother your PF she

Constructions expressing similarity and resemblance between entities are shaped by
Emai verbs u ‘seem’ and re ‘take after.’ Each accepts a following bi ‘like’ phrase: NP
u bi NP and NP ree bi NP. Behavioral similarity is required for u bi and perceptual
similarity for re bi.20(173) a. ólí ómòhè úù          bí érá       óì.

semblance. They compare referents articulated as grammatical subject and bi com-
plement. These constructions constrain inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs, the
syntactic shape of their noun phrases, and their potential for expressing polarity
and mood.
     Constructions with u bi restrict mood and polarity expression. They are found as
negative statements (ólí ómò í ì úù bí ómòhè [the child SC NEG seem like male] ‘The
child does not seem like a male’). They never occur as polar interrogatives, impera-
tives or prohibitives.
     Predicate u in construction with bi does not tend to exhibit properties typically
associated with verbs. It limits inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. u bi severely
restricts auxiliaries and preverbs. It rejects deontic, epistemic, and relative tense
auxiliaries. As well, it excludes all preverbs, including aspectualizers, evaluatives,
temporals, subject attributives, quantities and manner deictics. Relative to inflec-
tion, u bi permits Present perfect in an irregular fashion, since high low tone on the
verb itself is atypical. It does not inflect for Past perfect, prospective aspect or imper-
fect aspect.(174) ólí ómòhè úù          bí érá óì.
      the man PRP.seem like father his
      ‘The man seems like his father.’      Noun phrase positions framed by u bi differentially restrict NP type, animacy
and syntactic shape. Initial position, as subject, accepts nominative pronouns (e.g.
o, i). Nonetheless, it does not allow indefinite subject pronoun a.(175) a. ò / *à úù            bí émèlúgbó.
         it one PRP.seem like bush.cow

496 | Be, do, happen and haveSubjects of u bi accept common nouns, regardless of animacy. However, common
nouns occur only under a definiteness condition, as shown by definite article ólí.(177) a. ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn úù           bí émèlúgbó.

PRP.seem like father his] ‘This / That youth seems like his father’) as well as nóì
(óvbékhán nóì úù bí ólí ó ò khònmé [youth next PRP.seem like one he H become.sick]

     Subjects of u bi also accept impersonal pronouns21: demonstratives such as deic-
tic óáìn (óáìn úù bí ólì ó ò khònmé [that.one PRP.seem like one he H become.sick]
‘That one seems like one who is sick’) and contrastive ónóì (ónóì úù bí óhánmí ó ò

forms also appear as subjects when head of a partitive vbi phrase. Disallowed in
subject position are kindred pronouns (deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn).
    Complements of bi are more severely constrained with respect to NP type, ani-
macy and syntactic shape. They accept bare common nouns that are human
(òkpòsò), animate (émèlúgbó), or inanimate (ùbèlè).(178) a. ólí óvbékhán nà úù            bí òkpòsò.

      ‘The man seems like Ohi.’     However, bi complements resist determiners and pronouns. As bi complement,
a personal pronoun is unacceptable. bi complements also reject impersonal pro-
nouns such as demonstrative óáìn22 (*ólí éwè úù bí óáìn [the goat PRP.seem like
that.one] ‘The goat seems like that one’). As for determiners, bi complement position
excludes nouns with definite predeterminer ólí (*ólí éwè úù bí ólí émèlúgbó [the goat
PRP.seem like the bush.cow] ‘The goat seems like the bush cow’), an additional
postdeterminer such as demonstrative áìn (*ólí éwè úù bí ólí émèlúgbó áìn [the goat
PRP.seem like the bush.cow that] ‘The goat seems like that bush cow’) and kindred
élìyó (*ólí éwè úù bí émèlúgbó élìyó [the goat PRP.seem like bush.cow that.kind] ‘The
goat seems like a bush cow of that kind’).
     Noun phrase positions in u bi constructions limit relations to discourse defined
positions. Subject does not correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent
or interrogative pronoun.(180) *ólí ómóhé nà lí ó úù                bí érá  óì.

position, or to an interrogative pronoun.(181) *érá    óì lí ólí ómòhè úù        bí.
       father his PF the man PRP.seem like
       ‘The man seems like his father.’8.5.2 Perceptual ree biConstructions framed by ree bi express physical resemblance between two entities.
They compare referents articulated as grammatical subject and bi complement. The
resulting constructions show more severe syntactic limitations than u bi.
     ree bí constructions limit inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. They disallow any
deontic, epistemic or relative tense auxiliary. Likewise, ree bí constructions reject
preverbs, regardless of class: aspectualizer, evaluative, temporal, subject attribu-
tive, quantity and manner-demonstrative. Their subject phrase shows the tone pat-
tern of Present perfect (right edge low tone). The high low tone on the predicate is
atypical but similar to locative ri tone. With prototypic verbs, high low tone in Pre-
sent perfect is limited to auxiliaries and preverbs. ree bí constructions never appear
in the Past perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(182) a. ólí óvbèkhàn réè             bí érá      óì.
         the youth     PRP.take.after like father his
         ‘The youth physically resembles / takes after his father.’
      b. ólì òkpòsò réè             bí ómòhè.
         the woman PRP.take.after like male
         ‘The woman is masculine.’     Constructions with ree bi severely restrict polarity and mood. They fail as nega-
tive statements, polar interrogatives, imperatives and prohibitives, as unacceptable
negatives suggest (*ólí óvbèkhàn í ì rèè bí érá óì [the youth SC NEG take.after like
father his] ‘The youth doesn’t resemble his father’).
     Noun phrase positions linked to ree bi manifest contrasting grammatical prop-
erties. Each restricts NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. The initial noun phrase
in ree bi constructions accepts nominative pronouns (e.g. o). It thus serves as
grammatical subject. However, it rejects the indefinite subject pronoun (a).(183) ò / *à réè               bí òhí.
      he one PRP.take.after like Ohi
      ‘He physically resembles Ohi.’

      ‘Ege resembles Oje.’               ‘Afuze resembles Lagos.’    Subjects with ree bi accept common nouns, regardless of animacy, provided
they are definite, as indicated by definite predeterminer (ólí).(185) a. ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn réè               bí ólí ómòhè.

         the cloth cloth PRP.take.after like rope
         ‘The cloth physically resembles a rope.’     Subject position in ree bi constructions allows most postdeterminers: demon-
stratives deictic áìn (ólí ókpósó áìn réè bí ómòhè [woman that PRP.take.after like
man] ‘The next woman resembles a man’) and contrastive nóì (ókpósó nóì réè bí
ómòhè [woman next PRP.take.after like man] ‘The next woman resembles a man’),
universal quantifier collective èrèmé (érúé èrèmé réè bí émèlúgbó [deer all

òdóòdé, existential quantifiers, partitive ésò and contrastive évbèé, (úkpún ósò /
óvbèé réè bí úí mè [cloth certain another PRP.take.after like rope my] ‘A certain /

cardinal èvá (érùè èvá / érùè èvá vbí íyàìn réè bí émèlúgbó [deer two deer two LOC
them PRP.take.after like bush.cow] ‘Two deer / Two deer from them resemble a bush
cow’). As shown, cardinal forms also occur as head of a partitive vbi phrase. Exclud-
ed from subject position are kindred forms, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn.
     ree bi subject allows all impersonal pronouns except kindred (élìyó, ódàn).23 Ac-
ceptable are demonstratives, deictic óáìn and contrastive ónóì (óáìn / ónóì réè bí
ómòhè [that.one next.one PRP.take.after like man] ‘That one / The next one resem-
bles a man’), distributive universal òdóòdé and collective èrèmé (èrèmé réè bí

tive vbi phrase.
     Complements of bi are highly constrained with ree bi. Concerning NP type, bi
complements allow proper nouns of person (òhí) or place (èkó).(186) ólí ómò réè             bí òhí. /      áfúzé' réè           bí èkó.
      the baby PRP.take.after like Ohi       Afuze PRP.take.after like Lagos

       the baby PRP.take.after like him
       ‘The baby physically resembles him.’Regardless of animacy, bi complements accept bare common nouns: human, ani-
mate or inanimate. As well, they take common nouns modified by definite article ólì
or a postdeterminer.(188) a. ò réè              bí (ólì) òkpòsò.

stratives deicitic nà and áìn (ólí óvbèkhàn réè bí ólí ómóhé nà / áìn [the youth

contrastive nóì (ólí óvbèkhàn réè bí ómóhé nóì [the youth PRP.take.after like man

ényè réè bí úí élìyó / ódàn [the snake PRP.take.after like rope that.kind differ-

ómóhé ósò / óvbèé [the youth PRP.take.after like man certain another] ‘The youth

quantifiers (collective èrèmé, distributive òdóòdé) and numerals (cardinal èvá, col-
lective èvèvá).
                                                                    ‘have’ verb | 501     As bi complement, some impersonal pronouns are allowed.24 Included are
demonstratives deictic ònà and óáìn (ólí óvbèkhàn réè bí ónà / óáìn [the youth

well as contrastive ónóì (ólí óvbèkhàn réè bí ónóì [the youth PRP.take.after like

réè bí ósò / óvbèé [the youth PRP.take.after like certain another] ‘The youth resem-
bles a certain one / another one’). Pronouns excluded code quantification, e.g. uni-
versal quantifiers (collective èrèmé, distributive òdóòdé) and numerals (cardinal
èvá, collective èvèvá).
     Noun phrase positions framed by ree bi restrict discourse repositioning of con-
stituents. Subject fails to correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent or
interrogative pronoun. Similarly, bi complement position never corresponds to a
focus or topic constituent, or an interrogative pronoun.(189) a. *òjè òkpá lí ó réè                  bí ólí ómòhè.
          Oje alone PF he PAP.take.after like the man
          ‘It was Oje alone who resembles the man.’
      b. *ólí ómóhé nà lí ójé réè                bí.
          the man this PF Oje PAP.take.after like
          ‘It is this man that Oje resembles.’8.6 ‘have’ verb
The verb moe ‘have’ articulates relations of possession, either alienable or inaliena-
ble. It also translates English ‘own’ and ‘belong to.’25 Canonical moe constructions
frame two noun phrase positions and associated semantic roles: subject possessor
and direct object possessum. These constructions are limited as to overall syntactic
shape, including noun phrase exponents and verbal properties.(190) a. àlèkè mòè         àmágò.
         Aleke PRP.have mango
         ‘Aleke has a mango.’
      b. àlèkè mòè         ómò.
         Aleke PRP.have child
         ‘Aleke has a child.’
      c. ì mòè        óbò.
         I PRP.have hand
         ‘I have a hand.’
502 | Be, do, happen and haveNot all possession relations are expressed by moe constructions. Possession rela-
tions found in English predications ‘have a stain’ or ‘have food,’ for instance, are not
expressed with moe.(191) a. *ólì ìtébù / *ìtébù mòè         ínwà.
          the table table PRP.have stain
          ‘The table / A table has a stain.’
      b. *ólí áwà / *áwà mòè            émàè.
          the dog dog PRP.have food
          ‘The dog has food.’     Constructions with moe restrict mood but not polarity. They appear as negative
statements (ólí ómòhè í ì mòè úkpùn [the man SC NEG have cloth] ‘The man does not
have cloth’) and polar questions (ólí ómòhè mòè ólí úkpùn? [the man PRP.have the
cloth] ‘Does the man have the cloth of a particular type?’). However, they fail as
imperatives and prohibitives.
     Noun phrase positions in canonical moe constructions differentially constrain
NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. They also accept distinct sets of nouns, pro-
nouns and modifiers. The noun phrase position preceding moe allows nominative
pronouns, regardless of person or number. It rejects indefinite subject pronoun a.(192) ò / ì / mà / *à mòè             ópìà.
      he I    we      one PRP.have cutlass
      ‘He owns / I own / We own a cutlass.’Subject position in moe constructions allows proper nouns and common nouns. moe
subject accepts proper nouns of person (òlólò) or place (áfúzé').(193) òlólò mòè        íkèké.      /     áfúzé' mòè          úkpódè.
      Ololo PRP.have bicycle             Afuze PRP.have road
      ‘Ololo has a bicycle.’              ‘Afuze has a road.’Subject position with moe accepts animate (áwà) or inanimate (ìtébù) common
nouns regardless of modification by definite predeterminer ólí.(194) a. ólí áwà / áwà mòè            ùrìàì.

article ólí, a postdeterminer or both.(195) a. ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn mòè          ópìà.

tives deictic nà and áìn (ólí ómóhé nà / ólí ómóhé áìn mòè ólí úkpùn [the man this the
man that PRP.have the cloth] ‘This / That man has the cloth’) as well as contrastive
nóì (ómóhé nóì mòè ólí úkpùn [man next PRP.have the cloth] ‘The next man has the

lowing an optional definite article ((élí) ímòhè èvá mòè élí íkpùn [the men two

     In addition, moe subject allows impersonal pronouns.26 Included are demon-
stratives deictic ònà and óáìn in addition to contrastive ónóì (ónóì / óáìn mòè íkèké

associated with verbs. moe restricts inflection, verbal affixes, auxiliary categories
and preverbs.
     moe constructions limit aspect. They inflect for Present perfect in an irregular
fashion. moe subject phrase shows the expected right edge low tone, but verb tone
is low. Typically, verb tone is high for Present perfect. Past perfect inflection with a
right edge high tone subject phrase, regardless of verb tone, is unacceptable in sim-
ple declarative constructions.(203) ólí ómòhè mòè       àmágò.

     Stop sounds occur at four places of articulation: bilabial, alveolar, velar, and

places of articulation: bilabial, alveolar, palatal, labiovelar and glottal. They show
allophonic relationships with nasal consonants at four places: bilabial, alveolar,
palatal and labiovelar. Alternation in three instances is conditioned by a nasal vow-
el (‘vb’~‘m,’ ‘w’~‘nw,’ and ‘y’~‘ny’) and in one instance by syntactic positioning
and/or syntactic category (‘l’~‘n’, Chapter 9, 9.1). The two approximants ‘h’ and ‘r’
fail to alternate with nasal consonants.

Emai is a terraced-level tone language showing high, low, and down-stepped high.
For some word classes, inherent tone values distinguish words that in all other as-
pects of sound shape are identical. Nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs in
citation form express lexical meanings through tonal contrasts. Citation forms of
verbs, auxiliaries, and adverbial preverbs generally exhibit no tonal contrast, as
with other Edoid languages (Elugbe 1989). Emai verbs, auxiliaries, and preverbs are
assigned tone values reflecting grammatical properties of their constructions. In
large part these values correlate with the categories indicative and subjunctive
mood. More specifically, major patterns of tonal contrast derive from aspect (per-
fect, imperfect and prospective), modality (deontic and epistemic) and sentence
complement type.
     For Emai words composed of identical segments, predominantly nouns and ad-
verbs, tone values play a distinguishing role. Emai's high (H), down-stepped high
(!H) and low (L) tones combine in various ways within otherwise identical lexical
nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs. In orthographic practice, high tone is
                                   Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 5represented by an acute accent, low tone by a grave accent, and down-stepped high
by an acute accent immediately followed by a single quote. The last of these tones is
one pitch step lower than an immediately preceding high tone.ódòn                  òdón                   òkpá                   òkpà

‘vomit’                ‘fist’                ‘monkey’               ‘trickery’    Various combinations of tone occur within lexical items. An initial high tone
vowel immediately followed by a consonant can be followed by a low tone, a high
tone, or a down-stepped high.áwà [ H L ]                ónóì [ H H L ]                     éghó' [ H !H ]

high tone vowel.ìwè [ L L ]                             ùgín [ L H ]
‘house’                                 ‘basket’Downdrift () affects non-initial high tone, lowering the latter's pitch when preced-
ed by a low tone.ódùdú [ H L H ]                        íkèké [ H L H ]
‘shadow’                                ‘bicycle’1.4 Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography
Major word classes tend to reflect contrasting syllable structures, although no abso-
lute relation exists between category type and syllable character. All parts of speech
are vowel final. Nouns are uniformly vowel-initial. Verbs tend to be consonant ini-
tial, with a few being vowel initial. Adjectives are usually consonant initial, whereas
adverbs are either vowel- or consonant initial. Of the minor categories, some are
predominantly consonant initial with a few vowel initial forms (preverbs, postverbal
particles, complements). Other minor categories are vowel initial (determiners) with
a few consonant initial forms (intensifiers). The preposition class is consonant ini-
tial. Concord expression is vowel only with fixed tone patterns.
      In pronunciation, the syllabic character of word classes in phrasal or clausal
constructions is normally adjusted by one or another phonological process: vowel
6 | Orthography and grammatical overviewelision or glide formation. These processes lead to a divergence between the ortho-
graphic practice of employing citation forms and normal-rate pronunciation ren-
dered phonetically. Regardless of phonetic transformation through glide formation
or vowel elision, orthographic practice retains vowel segments in all word classes.
     Glide formation affects the close vowels [i] and [u] when they precede non-close
vowels within a lexical or syntactic constituent. These vowels alternate with the
glides [y] and [w], respectively, as illustrated by the verbs fi and ku when followed
by a noun phrase.fí    ópìà [fyópìà]                     kú    àmè [kwàmè]
throw cutlass                           throw water     Under specific grammatical conditions, the vowel elision process omits a mor-
pheme-final vowel. Elision differentially affects word classes, revealing complex
interactions between phonological and syntactic parameters. Vowel elision applica-
tion is restricted across major syntactic constituents like subject/predicate and pred-
icate/adverb. In normal pronunciation of the sentence below, neither the final vow-
el of the subject noun ókpósó ‘woman’ nor the initial vowel of the verb éhén
‘prepare’ elide. Similarly, neither the final vowel of the direct object ákhé ‘pot’ nor
the initial vowel of the adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ elide. However, the final vowel of the
predeterminer ólì ‘the’ elides, as does the final vowel of the verb éhén.ólí ókpósó éhén'        ákhé òdè. [ólókpósó éhán'khé òdè]
the woman PAP.prepare pot yesterday
‘The woman prepared a pot yesterday.’Vowels juxtaposed due to discourse repositioning of constituents are not elided. The
final vowel of noun áwà ‘dog,’ when in clause-initial topic position, is not omitted
relative to the initial vowel of following élì ‘the.’ólí áwà, élí ímòhè khú            óì. [óláwà élímòhè khú óì]
the dog the men PRP.chase it
‘As for the dog, the men chased it.’    Vowel elision in pronunciation reflects three phonetic patterns that become
transparent most easily with transitive verb phrases. When a lexical direct object
immediately follows a consonant initial verb with a single vowel, the final vowel of
the verb is omitted, while the initial vowel of the direct object is retained. Ortho-
graphic representation shows both vowels nonetheless, as shown by comparing
orthographic representations to square bracketed broad phonetic representations.

kill dog                                buy woodVerbs defined by a single nasal vowel reflect a second pattern. In pronunciation, the
vowel itself is omitted but its nasal quality is retained and assumed by the initial
vowel of the ensuing noun phrase. Again, phonetic and orthographic representa-
tions diverge.sén áwà [sánwà]                         tón ímòhè [tínmòhè]
stab dog                                bury menStill a third phonetic pattern is exhibited by verbs with a sequence of identical vow-
els (koo ‘read’). In pronunciation, the sequence shortens when a lexical direct object
follows; it does not elide entirely. Comparison to a single vowel verb (ko ‘plait’)
illustrates the contrast. Orthographic presentation of each verb is consistent with its
citation form.kóó ébè [kóébè]                         kó    émà [kémà]
read book                               plant yamLastly, verb final vowels do not elide when followed by a pronominal direct object.sá óì [sáóì]                            gbé óì [gbéóì]
fetch it                                kill it     Orthographic and broad phonetic representations exhibit varying degrees of
congruency in the case of word formation. Since both vowel elision and glide for-
mation are evident in the pronunciation of compounds and nominalizations, identi-
fication of morpheme elements is often obscured by vowel omission. To maintain
some level of morpheme transparency in orthographic practice, elided vowels in
compounds and nominalizations are accounted for in two ways.
     Nominalized word forms in pronunciation exhibit no major incongruency rela-
tive to orthographic practice. Nouns derived from a verb by prefix addition, show no
vowel elision.àòó ‘thought’                           oo ‘to think’
èkpà ‘vomit’                            kpa ‘to vomit’Compound forms, however, pose potential problems for orthographic practice.
Vowels at word boundaries within compounds are subject to elision. When the verb
in a verb-noun compound is transitive (e.g. ze ‘scrape,’ da ‘drink’), its single vowel
8 | Orthography and grammatical overviewis elided. Comparison of forms for ‘barber’ and ‘drunkard’ reveal how only the
sound shapes of prefix and noun, but not verb, are consistent across broad phonetic
form and orthographic practice.òzètò    [ò-ze-étò]                     òdènyò    [ò-da-ényò]
‘barber’ prefix-scrape-hair             ‘drunkard’ prefix-drink-wineElision also affects nasal vowels in verb-noun compounds but not in the manner
evident in syntactic constructions. Whereas only the vowel of a verb is elided in
syntactic phrases, both the vowel and its nasal quality (e.g. ken ‘divide’ and kpen ‘be
next to’) tend to be effaced in compounds.ákèvà          [á-ken-èvá]              ókpòkhúnmí [ó-kpen-òkhùnmì]
‘twin kernels’ prefix-divide-two        ‘upward’    prefix-be.next.to-topIn compounds, non-nasal vowels elide and are not rendered orthographically. In
noun-noun compounds, orthographic practice and broad phonetic rendering align,
except for the final vowel of the compound’s left constituent.ákòísí' [àkò     òísí']                 ákùhàì [àkò     ùhàì]
‘holster’ sheath gun                    ‘quiver’ sheath arrow    Elision is also evident in word formation involving reduplication. Forms refer-
ring to relationships of time and space involve reduplication of an entire root (e.g.
ésè ‘center of’ and édè ‘day’), with accompanying elision of the initial constituent’s
morpheme-final vowel. Orthographic practice shows the vowel as elided.ésèsé     [ésè-ésè]                     èdèdé    [édè-édè]
‘direct center of’                      ‘moments ago’
ésè                                     édè
‘center of’                             ‘day’    Pronunciation of phrasal compounds also reflects glide formation. The final
close vowels of augmentative údù and diminutive úvbì, when preceding a vowel,
assume a glide shape. Orthographic practice retains the corresponding vowel.údú émà [údwémà]                        úvbì àfàn [úvbyàfàn]
AUG yam                                 DIM harp

1.5 Basic sentence types and pitch register
Basic grammatical relations in Emai show the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
Declarative statements with transitive verbs reveal a subject noun phrase (ólí ómòhè
‘the man’) followed by a verb (é ‘eat’) and its direct object (ólí émàè ‘the food’).(1) ólí ómòhè é         ólí émàè.
    the man PRP.eat the food
    ‘The man has eaten the food.’Sentence types contrast with respect to voice-register and tonal pattern. Imperative
constructions utilize a normal voice register.(2) è ólí émàè.
    eat the food
    ‘Eat the food.’Declaratives rely on a normal voice register as well.(3) ólí ómòhè é         ólí émàè.
    the man PRP.eat the food
    ‘The man has eaten the food.’However, polar interrogatives (yes/no questions), while manifesting the same word
order as declaratives and essentially the same tonal patterns, employ a higher pitch
register.(4) ólí ómòhè é         ólí émàè?
    the man PRP.eat the food
    ‘Has the man eaten the food?’Rhetorical questions are also expressed through this higher register, adding a final
extra-high tone (e.g. é) to a lexical low tone (émàè).(5) ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàèé?
    the man SC C eat the food
    ‘The man is eating the food, is he?’
10 | Orthography and grammatical overview1.6 Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution
Tonal configurations in Emai reveal the interaction of lexical tone with syntactic
tone values derived from grammatical categories and their placement. Traditional
phrase heads such as nouns and verbs exhibit tonal variability controlled by pres-
ence or absence of modifying constituents or of adjacent phrases. For purposes of
illustration, we rely on noun phrases and monotransitive or ditransitive verb
phrases to convey an overview of the nature of this variability, although a full ac-
count of principles underlying sentence, clause and phrase tone remains to be un-
dertaken.","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

     The remaining construction types, all of which show a discourse defined posi-
tion, exhibit varying degrees of compatibility. Information questions are the most
severely restricted.
     Topic position combines with positive focus, negative focus and direct ques-
tions. It fails with right dislocation. No matter the other construction, the topic con-
stituent appears in leftmost position (*ólí ómòhè lí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man PF the
rat he PAP.kill it] ‘It was the man, as for the rat, who killed it’). When topic and posi-
tive focus position co-occur, topic precedes the li/ni marked focus constituent.(159) a. ólí ófè, ólí ómòhè lí ó gbé'           óì.

íyòìn lí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he PF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it was he
who the man killed’).
     When topic and negative focus both occur, topic precedes the negative focus
noun phrase, never the reverse (*ólí ómòhè kí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man NF the rat he
PAP.kill it] ‘It wasn’t the man, as for the rat, who killed it’).(160) ólí ófè, ólí ómòhè kí ó gbé'         óì.

     When topic and information question frames co-occur, topic precedes the ques-
tion word (*ébé' ólí ómòhè, ó' yé? [where the man he PAP.move.to] ‘Where, as for the
man, did he move to?’, *émé' ólí ómòhè, ó ré' híán ólí óràn? [what the man he

      ‘As for the man, why did he cut the wood?’     Topic and right dislocation are incompatible, even when each position corre-
sponds to a distinct grammatical relation in the matrix clause (*ólí ómòhè, ò shén óì,

     Positive focus shows extremely limited compatibility with other construction
types. It co-occurs with topic, as already indicated, and right dislocation but not
with negative focus and information questions.
     Positive focus and right dislocation are compatible, although crossover of
grammatical relations constrains grammatical acceptability. When matrix grammat-
ical subject corresponds to positive focus, matrix direct object in a monotransitive
complement can correspond to a right dislocated constituent. However, a direct
object in a monotransitive complement that corresponds to a focus position noun
phrase never co-occurs with a subject that corresponds to a constituent in RD posi-
tion (*ólí úkpùn lí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the cloth PF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man]

     Negative focus also shows limited co-occurrence with other construction types.
It appears with topic, as already seen, and right dislocation, but not with positive
focus or direct questions. Negative focus and right dislocation are compatible, alt-
hough crossover of grammatical relations in the matrix clause limits combinations.
Subject corresponds to a constituent in negative focus position when a direct object
corresponds to right dislocated position.(164) a. ólí ómòhè kí ó shén'          óì, í khì ólí úkpùn.
         the man NF he PAP.sell it ID be the cloth

         the man NF he PAP.kill it ID be the rat
         ‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’But a direct object that corresponds to negative focus position never co-occurs with
a subject that corresponds to right dislocated position (*ólí úkpùn kí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí
ómòhè [the cloth NF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man] ‘It wasn’t the cloth that he sold,
that is the man’, *ólí ófè kí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the rat NF he PAP.kill-F ID be the
man] ‘It wasn’t the rat that he killed, that is the man’).
     Negative focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even with distinct
grammatical relations affected, NF and questions are incompatible (*ébé' ólí ómòhè

go to?’, *ólí ómòhè kí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man NF where he PAP.move.to-F] ‘It wasn’t
the man so where did he move to?’).
     As indicated previously, right dislocation co-occurs with positive focus, nega-
tive focus and with information questions. It never combines with topicalization. RD
and information questions are compatible provided distinct matrix relations are
involved. Moreover, crossover of subject to right dislocated position and direct ob-
ject to question position is acceptable.(165) émé' ó shén'-ì,       í khì ólí ómòhè?
      what he PAP.sell-F ID be the man
      ‘What did he sell, that is the man?’In addition, the constraint limiting RD to subject or direct object does not apply
under a question condition. Indirect objects marked by Applicative li/ni appear in
RD position with question words corresponding to subject or direct object.

"6.6 Ideophonic adverbs
Ideophonic adverbs articulate meanings that reflect speaker perspective. They need
not express a meaning shared by speaker and hearer and as such are not open to
interrogation by a hearer. Like other adverbs, they occupy postverbal position and
induce high tone spread in an immediately preceding noun phrase constituent.
     Ideophonic adverbs assume a variety of morphological shapes and often ex-
press meanings typically lexicalized in English verbs. Some exhibit reduplication or
triplication.gbírígbírí ‘jerkily’                      dúdúdú    ‘very dark’
ghóíghóí ‘glisteningly’                   kpákpákpá ‘tremblingly’
púpúpú ‘flappingly’                       kpékpékpé ‘shiveringly’
kpíkpíkpí ‘flutteringly’                  gbágbágbá ‘slappingly’Others fail to exhibit either reduplication or triplication.píí ‘flingingly’                          wóò ‘smackingly’
váí ‘snatchingly’                         gbìó ‘crackingly’
bóí ‘poppingly’                           yáá ‘simmeringly’
yóò ‘whoosh’                              húú ‘pungently’Ideophonic adverbs co-occur with a single verb or a few verbs of similar sense.
While they seem closely related to clause assertion, ideophonic adverbs do not fall
within the scope of assertion as judged by émé'…u ‘what happen,’ émé'…ruan ‘what
happen,’ and émé'…u ‘what do’ questions. Responses to these question types that
include an ideophonic adverb (e.g. pèú, gábé, bóbóbó) are unacceptable.(135) émé' ójé ú'-ì?

      ‘Oje ran.’                          ‘Oje scampered off.’     Some ideophonic adverbs appear to heighten an event’s intensity level vis-à-vis
its predicate. The verb si, for instance, has the sense ‘draw, pull,’ whereas the collo-
cation of si and the ideophonic adverb gúómí ‘with a jerk’ conveys a meaning equiv-
alent to the English verb ‘jerk, cause a sudden jerky movement.’ Likewise, the collo-
cation of verb khaan ‘pound’ and ideophone gùán ‘with a poke’ specifies English
verb ‘poke.’ khaan alone does not express ‘poke’; instead, it conveys ‘pound.’(138) a. ólì àgbèdé      sí'         óí vbí éán gúómí.
         the blacksmith PAP.draw him LOC here with.a.jerk

         he PRP.pound it move.against them LOC mouth
         ‘He pounded it against their mouth.’With similar effect, other ideophonic adverbs (e.g. kútúkútú, tòbótòbó, yéyéyé) ex-
press meanings encapsulated by the English verbs ‘seethe,’ ‘glitter’ and ‘quiver.’
338 | Adverbial adjunctsThese adverbs combine with verbs (tin, jin, guo) that alone convey the related senses

A subclass of postverbal adverbs consists of forms whose base morpheme corre-
sponds to a synchronic verb. Deverbalized adverbs exhibit severe syntactic limita-
tions. Among these forms are reduplicated rùrùrúrú and bìbìbíbí. Each corresponds,
respectively, to extant verbs ruru ‘be foolish’ and bibi ‘move in zigzag fashion.’(143) a. òjè ò ó tà       étá    rùrùrúrú. /   ójé ó ò rùrú.
         Oje SC C speak words foolishly        Oje SC H be.foolish
         ‘Oje is speaking foolishly.’          ‘Oje is foolish.’
      b. òjè ò ó lá bìbìbíbí.              /   òjè ò ó bìbí.
         Oje SC C run staggeringly             Oje SC C move.zig.zaggedly
         ‘Oje is running with a stagger.’      ‘Oje is zigzagging.’Deverbal adverbs tend to be syntactically restricted. They occur in clauses inflected
for imperfect aspect. They reject perfect and prospective aspect.(144) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó tà        étá    rùrùrúrú.
         the man SC C speak words foolishly
         ‘The man is speaking foolishly.’

         the man SC H speak words foolishly
         ‘The man speaks foolishly.’Deverbal adverbs correspond to direct questions framed by manner ébé'/ébí' …i
‘how’ or extent ébé'/ébí'…i…se ‘to what extent.’ Responses show adverbs in situ, not
as simple adverb phrases.
340 | Adverbial adjuncts(145) ébé' ólí ómóhé ó ò í           tà   étà?
      how the man SC H MAN speak words
      ‘How does the man speak?’
      ò ó tà       étá     rùrùrúrú.    /    *rùrùrúrú.
      he C speak words foolishly              foolishly
      ‘He is speaking foolishly.’             ‘Foolishly.’     Regarding polarity and mood, deverbal adverbs fail to appear in imperatives,
prohibitives, negative statements or polar questions, as an unacceptable polar ques-
tion suggests (*ólí ómòhè ò ó tà étá rùrùrúrú? [the man SC C speak words foolishly]
‘Is the man speaking foolishly?’).
     Discourse repositioning of deverbal adverbs is unacceptable. They fail in li/ni
focus position and in topic position.(146) *rùrùrúrú lí ólí ómóhé ó ò tà           étà.
       foolishly PF the man SC H speak word
       ‘It is foolishly that the man speaks.’6.8 Linear order of adverbs
Postverbal adverb classes exhibit order relations relative to a matrix verb.13 The
preferred order shows Manner nearest the verb and Temporal Deixis farthest from
the verb. Between these two are ordered Extent, Manner-demonstrative, Frequency,
Quantity and Place adverbs. Place is closer to Temporal-Deixis than Man-
ner/Frequency/Quantity. Order restrictions among classes also affect positioning
relative to complex predicates with postverbal particles or verbs in series.14                       V MA EX MD / FQ / QU / PL TDTemporal deictic adverbs (òdè) follow but do not precede adverbs of Place (vbí

poral Deixis (òdè) appear only in that order.

"12.2.1 Double object vbiThe verb vbi ‘beg’ occurs in a type one double object predication. Its NP2 articulates
an external possessor relation that becomes evident in a related construction. Dou-
ble object vbi alternates with a transitive structure where a direct object (erstwhile
NP3) precedes a locative vbi phrase. Complement of vbi is framed as an Associative
ísì phrase in which a body-part noun (óbò) as possessum precedes a human noun
possessor. It is the internal possessor of the vbi complement that serves as external
possessor, i.e. NP2, in the double object predication.(10) a. òlólò vbí       ójé éànmì.

tion showing a direct object (erstwhile NP3) followed by a locative vbi phrase whose
complement is framed as an Associative ísì phrase. Grammatical relations within the
latter reveal a body-part noun head as possessum linked to a complement as inter-
nal possessor. It is possessor complement that corresponds to double object NP2.(18) a. òhí zé'          ójé ùzà.

external possessor relation. Double object fi predications alternate with a double
object construction that accepts a locative vbi phrase whose complement is headed
by a body-part noun (ùòkhò). The latter serves as notional possessum relative to NP2
as external possessor (ójé).(26) a. òlólò fí         ójé úkpóràn.
        Ololo PRP.hit Oje stick
        ‘Ololo hit a stick onto Oje / hit Oje with a stick.’

        Ololo PRP.hit Oje stick        LOC back
        ‘Ololo hit a stick onto Oje’s back.’Double object fi predications also correspond to simple predications. In a transitive
frame, NP1 appears as subject and erstwhile NP3 as direct object followed by a loca-
tive vbi phrase whose complement is headed by a non-body-part nominal (òtòì).
However, fi does not correspond to a transitive frame with NP1 as subject and NP2 as
direct object followed by a locative vbi phrase whose complement is a body-part
noun.(27) a. ò fí          úkpórán vbì òtòì.

         he PRP.hit Oje LOC back
         ‘He hit Oje on his back.’In still another alternating transitive frame, fi occurs with erstwhile NP3 as subject
and NP2 as direct object followed by locative vbi phrase whose complement consists
of a body-part term. Relative to locative phrase body-part, transitive direct object
(erstwhile NP2) serves as external possessor.(28) úkpóràn fí         ójé vbì ùòkhò.
     stick     PRP.hit Oje LOC back
     ‘A stick hit Oje on his back / Oje’s back.’As a simple predicate with a meaning distinct from ‘hit,’ fi occurs with NP1 as sub-
ject and NP3 as direct object. Under this condition, fi has the sense ‘throw.’

ing this predication is a causative relation in which NP1 is causer and NP2 is causee.
NP3 expresses the condition (suffering) experienced by the causee. Double object
mie predications correspond to transitive structures with erstwhile NP2 as subject
and NP3 as direct object.

a causee relation vis-à-vis an assumed ‘mistress’ condition articulated by NP3. Dou-
ble object nwu predications correspond to simple transitive structures. nwu allows
NP1 as subject, but it only permits erstwhile NP3, not NP2, as direct object.(61) a. òlólò nwú       áléké ójè.

     b. òlólò nwú        ójè / *àlèkè.
        Ololo PRP.take mistress Aleke
        ‘Ololo took a mistress.’As a simple predicate with related sense ‘catch,’ nwu occurs with NP1 as subject and
NP2 as direct object. However, nwu fails with NP2 as subject and NP3 as direct object.(62) a. òlólò nwú       àlèkè.
        Ololo PRP.take Aleke
        ‘Ololo caught Aleke / *took Aleke (as a mistress).’
     b. *àlèkè nwú       ójè.
         Aleke PRP.take mistress
         ‘Aleke became a mistress.’In addition, there is no corresponding double object or transitive construction with
nwu that accepts a locative vbi phrase with a body-part noun complement. Rather
than a possession relationship, nwu double object predications reflect a causative
relation in which NP1 is causer and NP2 is causee.(63) a. *òlólò nwú        áléké ójé        vbí óbò.
         Ololo PRP.take Aleke mistress LOC hand

ing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, realization verbs in series, verbal
affixes, polarity and mood as well as argument repositioning in discourse. Double
object nwu predications restrict aspect. They inflect for Past or Present perfect but

13 Embedded S- and VP-complements
Emai exhibits embedded sentence (S) complements and verb phrase (VP) comple-
ments. S-complements exhibit three types based on complementizer form: indica-
tive (IND) khi, conditional (COND) si and subjunctive (SBJ) li. Broadly reflective of
types in Lyons (1977), each indicates a distinct commitment by speaker regarding
occurrence or potential occurrence of complement event: fully committed khi, con-
ditionally committed si or noncommittal li. Occurring clause initially, each comple-
mentizer constrains its subject noun phrase as well as inflectional, auxiliary and
preverb phrases.(1) a. ólì òkpòsò één-í         khí ólí ómóhé é'       ólí émàè.
       the woman PRP.know-F IND the man PAP.eat the food

       ‘The woman is asking Ohi whether the man has eaten the food.’
    c. ólì òkpòsò ò ó hòò lí       ólí ómóhé è ólí émàè.
       the woman SC C want SUBJ the man eat the food
       ‘The woman wants the man to eat the food.’Related to complement constructions are indirect questions (IQ). IQs, framed by
ébé'/ébí'…i or émé'/émí' for example (Chapter 7, 7.5), also restrict their subject
phrase as well as inflectional, auxiliary and preverb phrases.(2) ólí ókpósó ré'       é ébé' ójé í'         é ólí émàè.
    the woman PAP.CONC say how Oje PAP.MAN eat the food
    ‘The woman wondered how Oje ate the food.’An additional complement type is direct quote (DQ). Although its syntactic shape is
quite variable, ranging from complex sentences to single words, it provides an im-
plicit standard for assessing marked S-complement behavior.(3) ólí ómóhé ré'          é óí “ólì òkpòsò gbé         ólí ófè.”
    the man PAP.CONC say it the woman PRP.kill the rat
    ‘The man then said, “The woman has killed the rat.”’VP-complements also constrain inflectional, auxiliary and preverb phrases. They
show the nonfixed tonal pattern of a subjunctive verb phrase. In addition, their
                                      S-complement types and their interrogatives | 797logical subject, the preceding verb’s direct object (ólí ómóhé ‘the man’), is restricted

    the woman PAP.CONC tell the man eat the food
    ‘The woman then told the man to eat the food.’13.1 S-complement types and their interrogatives
S-complements marked by khi, li or si answer distinct information questions. Com-
plements marked by khi or li correspond to émé'/émí' ‘what.’(5) a. émé' ólí ómóhé é'          òhí?
       what the man PAP.tell Ohi

    she PAP.ask him COND the man PRP.kill the rat
    ‘She asked him whether the man has killed the rat.’VP-complements, showing no overt morphological marking, correspond to direct
questions with émé'/émí' ‘what.’ However, VP-complement alone is insufficient as a
response; both matrix and embedded VP are required.(7) émé' ólí ókpósó é'        ólí ómóhé?
    what the woman PAP.tell the man
    ‘What did the woman tell the man?’

    ‘She told the man to kill the rat.’            ‘Kill the rat.’13.2 Complement type constraints
S-complements, IQ-complements and VP-complements vary in their syntactic prop-
erties. S-complements headed by indicative khi and conditional si often pattern
alike, while subjunctive li and VP complements often show similar behavior. IQ-
complements reveal structural patterns frequently distinct from other complements.
The variable resistance of complement type to grammatical categories reflects a
scale. Indicative khi exhibits the least resistance, with conditional si at nearly the
same level. VP complements show greater resistance along with subjunctive li. IQ
restricts grammatical categories at a level between the pair khi-si and li-VP.1                           khi > si > IQ > li >          VP    Emai’s complement scale is illustrated by polarity and mood expression. S-
complements, IQ-complements and VP-complements show variable polarity and
mood. Sentences incorporating S-complement types, IQ-complements2 and VP com-
plements assume a polar interrogative form uniformly. However, only VP comple-
ments assume imperative shape.(8) a. ólí ókpósó ré'           é khì òjè é         ólí émàè?
       the woman PAP.CONC say IND Oje PRP.eat the food

       the woman PAP.CONC tell Oje eat the food
       ‘Did the woman tell Oje to eat the food?’In the expression of negation, S-complements, IQ-complements and VP-
complements vary. Perfect Negation (NEG) -ì appears in S-complements headed by
                                                   Complement type constraints | 799khi and si. Perfect Negation is disallowed for IQ-complements, li complements and
VP-complements.(9) a. ólí ókpósó ré'         é khì òjè í ì          è ólí émàè.

       the woman PAP.CONC say COND Oje SC NEG eat the food
       ‘The woman asked whether Oje did not eat the food.’     As indicated in the following sections, Emai complement types restrict inflec-
tional, auxiliary and preverb categories (Chapter 3). Inflection includes aspect, aux-
iliary includes deontic and epistemic modality as well as relative tense. Preverb
categories are aspectualizer, temporal, subject attributive, quantitative, evaluative
and manner-demonstrative. Overall, khi and si complements limit fewer of these
grammatical categories. IQ complements are somewhat more restricted. The most
severe restrictions affect subjunctive li and VP complements. The latter two com-
plement types reject inflection, all auxiliaries and most preverb categories, although
li complements show deontic Hortative í with pronouns.","[804, 805, 806, 807, 808, 809, 810, 811, 812, 813, 814, 815, 816, 817, 818, 819, 820, 821, 822, 823, 824, 825]"
"Relative to polarity and mood, ze predications are partially restricted. They appear
as imperatives, but not as prohibitives or negative statements. As polar questions
they are found only without a locative vbi phrase.(311) a. vbá khùyè òjè zé            vbì ìwè.

expresses an end state of exclusionary contact. In fact, V1 itself is a complex predi-
cate consisting of hian preceded by instrument verb re ‘take.’ hian in the ze complex
predicate requires a human noun direct object, e.g. òjè, while re takes only the body-
part noun óbò ‘hand.’ Predication sense is ‘exclude, restrain from, cut off,’ with
subject excluded from contact with the vbi complement referent. There is no corre-
sponding intransitive shape.(313) élí ívbèkhàn ré       óbò híán òjè zé           vbí úkpódè.
      the youths PRP.take hand cut Oje exclude LOC road

      the youths PRP.take hand cut Oje exclude

754 | Aspect expressing complex predicatesAs a simple synchronic predicate, ze fails, as seen in the preceding section’s discus-
sion of inclusion/penetration ze and reduplicated form zeze ‘congeal, become stiff.’
While no verb sense associated with ze seems related to exclusion, there is a mor-
pheme ze appearing in word formation that exhibits a potentially related sense. The
form ìzèzé ‘preoccupations’ occurs in constructions that have the sense ‘be preoccu-
pied, extremely focused to the exclusion of other matters.’ This sense, leading to an
end state of exclusion, may be the historical source of exclusion ze.(321) a. òjè ò ó là      ìzèzé.

tioning in discourse. Complex predicates with exclusion ze restrict aspect. They
inflect for Present and Past perfect but not imperfect Continuous.(322) a. élí ívbékhán ré'       óbò híán òjè zé        vbí úkpódè.

Complex predicates express a contact and mixture relation with V2 baa in series. V1
consists of an object manipulation verb such as nwu ‘take hold,’ fi ‘throw,’ ku ‘cast’
or ze ‘scoop.’ Direct object referents of each verb are brought into contact and inter-
mingle to form a composite. Predication sense is ‘add to, mix up with.’ Locative
complements play no role in complex baa predications.(327) a. ójé nwú'      émà báá     ògèdè.

       Oje PRP.do it add.to plantain
       ‘Oje added it to the plantain.’
756 | Aspect expressing complex predicates    Noun phrases in baa predications are restricted. NP2 and NP3 accept inanimates
referring to food (e.g. émà ‘yam,’ èbà ‘eba, cassava,’ ìkpèshè ‘bean,’ ókà ‘maize’).(329) ólí ómòhè fí        èbà báá émà.
      the man PRP.throw eba add.to yam
      ‘The man pounded / mixed / tossed in eba with the pounded yam.’However, NP2 and NP3 are strictly ordered. For instance, èbà as NP2 must precede
émà as NP3, and ókà as NP2 must precede ìkpèshè as NP3. Reversing this order is
unacceptable.(330) a. *ólí ómòhè fí         émà báá      èbà.
          the man PRP.throw yam add.to eba

          the man PRP.throw beans add.to maize

sponding to NP3 or NP2.(331) a. *émé' òhí nwú'        émà báá?

hough the verbs share NP1. V1 object manipulation verbs appear with NP1 as subject
and NP2 as direct object. Often these object manipulation verbs (e.g. nwu) exhibit a
sense shift between monotransitive meaning and complex predication.

11.11 Forcible dispossession
Emai complex predicates characterize forcible dispossession of an entity vis-à-vis an
unmentioned event participant. V1 do ‘do in stealth’ expresses forcible disposses-
sion of NP2 by NP1. V2 consists of a transitive object manipulation verb (e.g. nwu
‘take a singleton,’ hua ‘take a plurality’) or a consumption activity verb (e.g. da
‘drink’). V2 expresses the resulting possession relationship between NP1 as posses-
sor and NP2 as possessum. English translation of predication sense engages the verb
steal or collocations of dispossession, e.g. carry off.(342) a. òjè dó                   ólí úkpùn nwú.

       Oje PRP.do.in.stealth it do
       ‘Oje did it in stealth.’    Complex predicates with do fail to deconstruct strictly. V2, when transitive, oc-
curs with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object. V2 never occurs with NP2 as in-
transitive subject. As simple predicates, V2 forms assume a state of possessum ac-
quisition, their meanings contrasting with the loss asserted by complex
dispossession predicates.(344) a. òjè nwú        ólí úkpùn.
         Oje PRP.take the cloth

er, do from V1 position appears with activity verbs in complex predicates where it
conveys the manner sense ‘do in stealth, perform in secret.’ With an object manipu-
lation verb coding ritual change of possession (roo óhá ‘pick out a wife’), NP2 (óhá
‘wife’) appears after, not before, V2.(346) òjè dó                  róó     óhá óì.

Emai complex predicates articulate a state of resistance to a presumed change of
possession. V2 expresses resistance to possession change that results in retention of
possessum. Transitive verbs of object manipulation occur as V1 (e.g. nwu ‘take’).
Translation equivalents for the complex predications engage verbs hold, keep and
hide, respectively, with V2 forms moe, yaa and hee.

the discourse pronoun ìyó ‘so.’ Desiderative hoo shows subject identity across com-
plement and matrix clauses with logophoric pronouns. Additional properties
emerge from consideration of this verb and its S-complements.
    The verb hoo ‘want, search for’ takes S-complement types according to polarity.
In matrix affirmative structures, it accepts subjunctive li. Under this condition, hoo
does not permit conditional si, indirect question or VP complements.(201) ólí ómòhè ò ó hòó lí        ólí ókpósó dà ényò.
      the man SC C want SUBJ the woman drink wine
      ‘The man wants the woman to drink wine.’When the matrix clause is negative, hoo takes indicative khi complements, provided
the khi clause shows prospective Anticipative.(202) ólí ómòhè í ì      hòó khì ò ló        yè áfúzé'.
      the man SC NEG want IND he ANTI move.to Afuze
      ‘The man did not want to go to Afuze.’    Indicative marked hoo constructions require identity between matrix and com-
plement subject. However as pronoun, complement subject permits personal o ra-
ther than logophoric yon, the latter expected under a conjoint reference condition.(203) ólí ómòhè í ì      hòó khì ò / *yòn ló         yè  áfúzé'.
      the man SC NEG want IND he LOG ANTI move.to Afuze
      ‘The man did not want to be about to go to Afuze.’Subjunctive li constructions with hoo do not limit subject identity across clauses.
Across matrix and embedded clause, subject position takes a personal (o) or logo-
phoric (yon) pronoun.

complements of hoo correspond to émé' ‘what’. Responses require hoo as well as li
complement.(205) émé' ólí ómóhé ó ò hòó?

nya únù a ‘surprise’ and e o vbì o ‘be suitable for.’ They display transitive and in-
transitive shapes; none are ditransitive. Evaluative predicates take S-complements
marked by khi and/or li. None accepts complements marked by si or IQ. Evaluative
predicates limit aspect to the perfect and restrict polarity and mood outside negative
statements and polar interrogatives. Complement types with evaluative predicates
occur as embedded subjects that are obligatorily extraposed. For these predicates,
complements do not correspond to interrogative pronouns or to the discourse pro-
noun ìyó ‘so.’ As well, complements of evaluative predicates reject logophoric pro-
nouns and, due to extraposition, disallow subject identity across complement and
matrix clauses. Additional properties emerge from assessing each verb and its S-
complements.","[882, 883, 884, 885, 886, 887, 888]"
"11.1 Direct and indirect control of event realization
Emai verbs characterize a relation between event realization and its external con-

verb nwu ‘take hold’ as V1. As V2, intransitive verbs of stative posture occur, while
activity (e.g. e ‘eat’) and change of state (e.g. gbe ‘kill’) verbs do not. Predication

similar behavior. V2 consists of nonstative transitive or intransitive verbs. Predica-

      ‘Oje slowly did it.’The noun phrase position between fuen and re is restricted. It is confined to the
body-part noun égbè; no other body-part term is acceptable. In addition, NP2 égbè
allows no syntactic elaboration by pre- or post-determiners and no substitution by
an accusative pronoun (e.g. óì).5(51) a. ólí ómòhè fúén       égbè /*àwè ré     kpóón ólí ókòó.

occur synchronically without re, regardless of aspect.(53) ójé ó ò fùèn égbé ré.

sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument
repositioning in discourse. Relative to aspect, complex fuen égbè re predications
inflect for Past and Present perfect and imperfect Habitual. They do not inflect for

         food ASS his alone PF Oje PAP.slow body arrive eat
         ‘It was his food alone that Oje slowly ate.’11.3 Manner of directional change of state
Emai complex predicates characterize the manner of a directional change of locative
state. They do so relative to a closed class of intransitive and transitive directional
motion verbs as V2. Manner expression is either intransitive or transitive, as illus-
trated by the V1 forms la ‘run’ and sua ‘push.’ Regardless of transitivity, manner is
temporally simultaneous with direction. V1 and V2 events necessarily overlap such
that V1 occurs at all time points of V2 but V2 does not occur at all time points of V1.
In addition to manner (i.e. ‘push’ and ‘run’), translation equivalents engage English
directional prepositions, (i.e. into, around, through, across, among others).(60) a. ólí ómòhè súá        ókò     ó    vbí ékóà.
        the man PRP.push mortar enter LOC room

690 | Aspect expressing complex predicatesManner predications strictly order V1 and V2. Reversal as V2 V1 is unacceptable.(61) *ólí ómòhè ó           vbí ékóà súá ókò.
      the man PRP.enter LOC room push stool
      ‘The man entered the room and pushed a mortar.’Complex manner predications, illustrated with transitive V1 sua, do not restrict syn-
tactic elaboration of NP2. The latter, for instance, accepts definite article ólí.(62) ólí ómòhè súá       ólí ókò / ókó mè ó            vbí ékóà.
     the man PRP.push the mortar mortar my enter LOC room
     ‘The man pushed the mortar / my mortar into the room.’     Complex predications of manner allow a variety of verbs as V1, both transitive
(fioo) and intransitive (la, gbulu, de). As V2, verbs such as o ‘enter’ that convey path
or direction of motion in simple predicates appear in series with V1. Other direction
verbs include: dianre ‘come out,’ fan ze ‘move across, cross,’ heen ‘move up, as-
cend,’ kpoon ‘move down, descend,’ lagaa ‘move around, circle,’ se ‘move as far as,’
shoo re ‘move out of, off of, exit,’ ye ‘move toward,’ and raa re ‘move past/over.’(63) a. éfìòò fíóó       ólí ébè      ó    vbí ékéín ìwè.

and Present perfect and imperfect Continuous.(68) a. ójé súá'       ókò    ó      vbí ékóà.

Emai complex predicates cancel an implication of event fulfillment or an assump-
tion of event realization. An assumption of event occurrence is cancelled by V2 fee
ghoo. An implication of event fulfillment is cancelled by V2 ba kun. Translation
equivalents of predication sense engage English event realization verbs try, feign or
adverbial expressions canceling event fulfillment, e.g. in vain, without success, or
unsuccessfully.

occurrence. Predication sense is ‘try/feign.’ As V1, fee ghoo predications accept tran-
sitive and intransitive change of state verbs.(74) a. ólí ómòhè khúáé        ólì ùkòdò féé ghòò.

ment sense.7 It conveys the sense ‘pursue without desired effect’ when a male noun
occurs as notional pursuer in subject position (òjè) and a female noun appears as
notional pursuee in direct object position (àlèkè). A transposition of the gender
specific nouns is unacceptable.

Emai complex predicates confirm fulfillment of an implied intentional state, making
the intentional state explicit with V2. Source of the intentional state is V1. Intention-
ality is the apparent origin of the predication’s purposive semantic character. Ful-
fillment is verbally expressed by stative verbs of quality (e.g. fuan ‘clean’), nonsta-
tive verbs with stative implications (e.g. e ‘eat’) or predications of co-location (ku
gbe ‘position together’).(97) a. òjè hóó         ólí úkpùn fúán.
        Oje PRP.wash the cloth clean

     c. òjè dín      élí éwè kú gbè.
        Oje PRP.tie the goats position.together
        ‘Oje has tied the goats together.’11.5.1 Confirm stative intentional stateComplex predicates confirm fulfillment of an intentional state with a verb of qualita-
tive change of state. V2 denotes an intentional state that is lexically implied but not
asserted by V1. Since V2 choice is lexically dependent on V1, V2 form varies, exhibit-
ing a variety of meanings, although all are absolutive rather than gradient or scalar
(e.g. gba ‘be big’) in character.(98) a. òjè hóó       ólí úkpùn fúán.
        Oje PRP.wash the cloth be.clean
        ‘Oje washed the cloth clean / until it had become clean.’

        the man PRP.beat the woman die
        ‘The man beat the woman to death / until she died.’That V1 implies but does not assert intentional state V2 is revealed by constructions
with contrastive conjunction (àmáà ‘and’). Simple predicate V1 (kpe) with its subject
and direct object precede conjunct àmáà, which precedes simple predicate V2 (fuan)
with its subject pronoun. This entire construction is grammatical. But under condi-
tions where the implication of material change advanced by V1 is already confirmed,
e.g. by Change of State (CS) a particle, contrastive conjunction with àmáà fails.(99) a. ólí óvbékhán kpé'        ólì òkpàn àmáà ó ì          fùàn.

         the youth    PAP.wash the gourd CS but it NEG be.clean
         ‘The youth washed the gourd off but it was not clean.’V1 in stative confirmation predications does not accept pro-verb u ‘do.’(100) *òjè ú        óì fúán.
       Oje PRP.do it clean
       ‘Oje did/ make it clean.’    Complex predicates of stative confirmation deconstruct strictly. V1 occurs in a
transitive shape with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object.(101) òjè hóó       ólí úkpùn.

that implies a state. These predications convey a temporally sequential relation
between their subevents, with no necessary adjacency or overlap of temporal con-
tour. As with stative confirmation predications, nonstative predications reflect a
purposive semantic relation.(108) a. òjè dé        émà é.

Emai complex predicates identify the telic end state of a change of quantitative
state. Telicity is coded by semantically differentiated V2 forms se, gbe, khoon and so.
Each conveys, respectively, an end state that is sufficient, excessive, satisfactory or
maximal. The entire predication brings into perspective an incremental change of
quantitative state expressed by V1 and assigns to its end state a telic condition.

quantity. Complex se predications appear with intransitive or transitive verbs as V1.
Quantification is measured against grammatical subject for intransitive V1 (voon ‘be
full,’ mo ‘bear,’ bun ‘be many’) or direct object for transitive V1 (da ‘drink,’ e ‘eat’).
Prediction sense is ‘enough, sufficiently.’(131) a. ólì èkpà vóón            sé.

710 | Aspect expressing complex predicates11.6.2 Telic change of quantitative state gbeComplex predicates identify an implied quantitative state derived from event itera-
tion as excessive with V2 gbe. As V1, gbe predications accept transitive (e ‘eat’) or
intransitive (gbe ‘dance’) verbs whose quantitative extent accumulates through
event iteration and is measured against intransitive subject or transitive direct ob-
ject. Predication sense is ‘too much/too many.’(143) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó gbé gbè.

inanimate subject and partitive direct object has sense ‘become dull, blunt.’ It alters
this basic sense with a human subject and a double object framed as an external
possessor with inanimate possessor (whole) preceding possessum (part) and con-
veying sense ‘make blunt.’ The assumption of repetitive use leading to a state of
dullness may be source of the quantitative result state of complex gbe predications.(148) a. ólí ópìà     gbé-ì.

         Oje PRP.become.dull the cutlass edge
         ‘Oje made the edge of the cutlass dull.’In addition, gbe manifests another sense relevant to quantitative end state. With
animate or inanimate direct object, gbe expresses forceful contact: ‘beat, hit, make
contact repeatedly.’ This use assumes an iterative, repetitive character that may also
be the source of the quantitative result state meaning in complex gbe predications.12(149) a. ólí ómòhè gbé        ólì ìbè.

well as discourse repositioning of arguments. Regarding aspect, gbe predications
inflect for Present perfect or imperfect Continuous, not Past perfect.

"3.2.6.1 Number dobo, gba
Emphatic Reflexive and Collective manifest contrasting number restrictions. Em-
phatic Reflexive requires an immediately following pronoun agreeing in number
and person (óì) with grammatical subject (ólí ómòhè). Post dobo pronoun must show
accusative; neither a nominative nor genitive pronoun is allowed (Chapter 5, 5.4).(92) a. ólí ómòhè dóbó         óì híán ólí óràn.

146 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs     Among preverbs, only Emphatic Reflexive dobo can occupy either of two posi-
tions in focus constructions. In declaratives, dobo appears between subject and
verb, where other preverbs occur. In focus constructions, it assumes either preverb
position or head modifier position in a focus phrase. When it precedes focus marker
li/ni, dobo casts contrastive emphasis on its antecedent referent.(94) a. ólí ómòhè dóbó         óì gbé ólí ófè.

it does not accept both.(96) a. ólí ómòhè híán      égbé óì.

148 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs     Collective gba shows a more restricted distribution with inflection and auxilia-
ries. It takes only Past perfect (élí ímóhé gbá' é ólí émàè [the men PAP.COL eat the

Predictive (élí ímóhé ló gbà é ólí émàè [the men PRED COL eat the food] ‘The men

istemic auxiliary: élí ímòhè í gbà é ólí émàè [the men HOR COL eat the food] ‘The

ímóhé kpé' gbà é ólí émàè [the men PAP.SUB COL eat the food] ‘The men still ate the

     The number preverbs dobo and gba only minimally restrict polarity and sen-
tence mood. Reflexive dobo appears in negative statements (ólí ómòhè í ì dòbó óì è

the food’) and polar questions (ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì é ólí émàè? [the man PAP.REFL

accusative pronoun (assimilating to a preceding vowel), dobo occurs in imperatives
(dòbó ó é ólí émàè [REFL your eat the food] ‘Eat the food yourself’) and prohibitives
(é è dóbó ó é ólí émàè [you PR REFL your eat the food] ‘Don't eat the food yourself’).
     Collective gba, while never occurring in prohibitive constructions, appears in
polar questions (élí ímóhé gbá' é ólí émàè? [the men PAP.COL eat the food] ‘Did the

only with second person plural subjects (vbá gbà é ólí émàè [you COL eat the food
‘You all eat the food together’).
     Neither number preverb answers an information question. Thus, for Manner
ébé'/ébí'...i (ébé' élí ímóhé í' é ólí émàè? [how the men PAP.MAN eat the food] ‘How
did the men eat the food?)’, there is no response such as *é dóbó' íyàìn é óì [they

‘Together they ate it.’

Intensification preverbs anchor constrasting poles of quantification. zemi and zeze
augment a quantitative dimension within predicate meaning and assign it to either
intransitive subject or transitive direct object. Absolute Intensifier (ABSI) zemi ‘very
much’ asserts that intransitive subject or transitive direct object has attained a di-
mension's maximum value.(98) a. ólì òkpòsò zémì           dá.
        the woman PRP.ABSI be.tall
        ‘The woman is very tall.’
     b. ólì ògèdè     zémì         énghén.
        the plantain PRP.ABSI please
        ‘The plantain is very tasty.’
     c. ólì òkpòsò zémì          shén émà.
        the woman PRP.ABSI sell yam
        ‘The woman sold a lot of yam.’     Absolute Intensifier zemi shifts its frame of reference from quantity to quality/
evaluation under certain lexical and syntactic conditions. When the verb ze ‘build’
shows a direct object noun modified by the singular definite article ólí, zemi profiles
quality, i.e. ‘build very well.’ Undetermined or plural predetermined (élí) direct ob-
ject nouns with verb ze and zemi retain a quantitative reading.(99) a. ólí ómòhè zémì        zé    ólí óà.
        the man PRP.ABSI build the house
        ‘The man built the house very well / *many of the houses.’17
     b. ólí ómòhè zémì         zé    óà.
        the man PRP.ABSI build house

        the man PRP.ABSI build-DS the house
        ‘The man has built many of the houses.’Nonabsolute Intensifier (NABI) zeze signals that while an intransitive subject or
transitive direct object realizes a value exceeding a quantitative dimension's mini-
mum, the maximum remains unattained. zeze never exhibits a sense shift from
quantity to quality.(100) a. ólì òkpòsò zézè        dá.
         the woman PRP.NABI be.tall
         ‘The woman is not quite tall.’

        the woman PRP.NABI sell yam
        ‘The woman sold a bit / a measure of yam.’     Intensification preverbs limit inflection and auxiliary categories. Absolute In-
tensifier zemi accepts Past perfect (ólí ómóhé zé'mì é ólí émàè [the man PAP.ABSI eat
the food] ‘The man ate a lot of food’), Present perfect (ólí ómòhè zémì é ólí émàè [the
man PRP.ABSI eat the food] ‘The man has eaten a lot of food’) and imperfect Habit-
ual (ólí ómóhé ó ò zèmí tò vbí émà [the man SC H ABSI fond.of LOC yam] ‘The man is
very fond of pounded yam’). It rejects imperfect Continuous and both prospective
aspects.
     Relative to modality, zemi fails with deontic Hortative í as well as most epistem-
ic forms: rational Deductive and Resultative za, assumptive Concessive rere and
Hypothetical kha in addition to speculative Dubitatives vba or bia. zemi allows only
Certaintive ma (ólí ómòhè máà zémì é ólí émàè [the man PRP.CER ABSI eat the food]
‘The man surely ate a lot of the food’).
     zemi rejects Anterior and Subsequent relative tense, as unacceptable sentences
with ke suggest: *ólí ómóhé ké' zémì é vbí ólí émàè [the man PAP.ANT ABSI eat LOC
the food] ‘The man afterward ate a lot of the food.’
     Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze is restricted in a slightly different fashion. It allows
Past perfect (ólí ómóhé zé'zè é vbí ólí émàè [the man PAP.NABI eat LOC the food]
‘The man ate a bit from the food’) or Present perfect (ólí ómòhè zézè é vbí émàè [the
man PRP.NABI eat LOC the food] ‘The man has eaten a bit from the food’). zeze re-
jects imperfects and prospectives.
     Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze occurs with all modality forms except epistemic
Resultative za and Concessive rere. It follows deontic Hortative í (ólí ómòhè í zèzè é
vbí ólí émàè [the man HOR NABI eat LOC the food] ‘The man should eat a little of the
food’). Also, zeze follows remaining rational, speculative and assumptive forms: ólí
ómòhè záà zèzè é vbí ólí émàè [the man PRP.DED NABI eat LOC the food] ‘The man
must have eaten a bit of the food’, ólí ómóhé má' zèzè é vbí ólí émàè [the man

noncanonical shapes like polar interrogatives: ólí ómòhè kéè zèzè é ólí émàè? [the
man PRP.ANT NABI eat the food] ‘Did the man eat a bit of the food anymore?’.
     Both intensifier preverbs partially restrict polarity and sentence mood. Absolute
Intensifier zemi is limited to affirmative declaratives. It fails in imperatives, prohibi-
tives, negatives and polar questions. Unacceptable Perfect negation with zemi sup-
ports this restriction: *ólí ómòhè í ì zèmí è ólí émàè [the man SC NEG ABSI eat the
food] ‘The man did not eat a lot of the food’.
     Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze, while not appearing in imperatives or prohibi-
tives, is found in negative statements (ólí ómòhè í ì zèzé è ólí émàè [the man SC NEG
NABI eat the food] ‘The man did not eat a bit of the food’) and polar questions (ólí
ómòhè zézè é vbí ólí émàè? [the man PRP.NABI eat LOC the food] ‘Did the man eat a
bit of the food?’).
     Unlike other preverbs, intensifiers correspond to an interrogative frame. Each
answers a question of extent framed by ébé'/ébí'…í…se.(101) ébé' ólí ómóhé í'          dà      sé?

tion with V2 so in series. As V1, endpoint predications take a verb of motion, either

process of some duration followed by a singular end state condition.14 Neither sense

was achieved. In simple transitive predications, so has the sense ‘collide with, crash

Emai complex predicates assert the telic status of a change of existence state. V1
forms denote an incremental change of existence with an implied end state open to
718 | Aspect expressing complex predicatestelic specification. Existence end states manifest a distinct perceptual character
when oriented on the vertical or horizontal axis by V2 re and its ‘rise’ or ‘arrive’
sense, respectively. In effect, re expresses a change in entity existence from absence
to presence.
     With an intransitive verb, e.g. ze ‘grow,’ or a verb like filo ‘thrust’ as V1, re ‘rise’
predications assume incremental change of state on the vertical axis. They augment
intransitive subject or transitive direct object referent substance and assert percep-
tible emergence of the referent. In this respect, re predications represent the con-
verse of predications with the postverbal Change of State (CS) a particle. While CS a
predications refer to dissolution of material substance (Chapter 9, 9.3.2.1), re predi-
cations refer to emergence of substance. Predications with CS a and re refer less to
change of material state (e.g. from intactness or wholeness toward dissolution) than
to change in entity existence. For re that would be from physically absent to physi-
cally present; however, for CS a it would be from physically present to physically
absent. Translation equivalents for re ‘rise’ predications engage English forms of
emergence: prepositions out, up or verbs sprout, arise.(178) a. ólí ókà zé              ré'.

acter. The deictic reference point is the speaker or a speaker defined position, from
which perspective a change of existence state from absence to presence has oc-
curred. As V1, complex re ‘arrive’ predicates take transitive manipulation verbs or
transitive motion verbs (with attendant constraints on direct object shape).15 English
translation equivalents of predication sense rely on the verb bring or an additional
deictically centered clause of place.(179) a. ólí ókpósó nwú'     émà ré.

sense is expressed by ‘out, up’ or a distinct verb of achievement (e.g. ‘sprout’).(180) ólí ókà zé           ré'.
      the maize PRP.grow rise
      ‘The maize has sprouted / grown out.’Other simple V1 intransitives (hu ‘boil,’ san ‘become pellucid,’ ohia ‘grow’) express a
change of existence state whose end state is open to telic coding. However in re
predications existence end state is closed, i.e. achieved.(181) a. ólì òmì hú          ré'.

trate, ze implies but does not assert a perceptible end state.(182) a. ólí ókà zé-ì         /    *zé.

720 | Aspect expressing complex predicatesAs a simple transitive predicate, re manifests the sense ‘rise.’ As subject, re requires
an inanimate noun; human nouns are disallowed (*ólí ómòhè ré ókhúnmí ùhàì / ùhàì
[the man rise top well well] ‘The man rose to the top of the well’). As direct object, ré
requires a head noun that is spatially elaborated by, for example, ókhúnmí ‘top of.’16(184) ólí údúkpù ré          ókhúnmí àmè / *àmè.

ries.18 As V1, there occur transitive verbs of object manipulation, which in simple
predications convey a change of existence state open to deictic specification. In
complex predications, end state value is closed by telic re. Predications of this na-
ture assert that subject and direct object referents have arrived at the speaker or
some other deictic focal point, i.e. they have undergone a change of existence from
absence to presence. English translation is most often rendered by ‘bring.’(205) a. ólí ókpósó nwú'       émà ré.

tive noun or a syntactically elaborated nonlocative noun. Transitive re does not take
as direct object a deictic locative pronoun (èvbò) or an accusative pronoun (e.g. óì).

series with direction verb buu ‘approach.’19 As a simple predicate, buu expresses a
change of existence state open to telic specification. Simple buu takes as direct ob-
ject accusative pronouns (e.g. óì, é) in addition to lexical nouns (e.g. òkpòsò).(214) ólí ómò búú            óì / é / ólì òkpòsò.

buu and a first person pronoun direct object are unacceptable.(216) *ólí ómò búú           mè.

Emai complex predicates expressing a change in positional state specify telic status
with multiple V1 forms. Until signaled as telic by V1, either positional change is
incremental and aligns with simple V2 transitive verbs or position is stative and
aligns with simple V2 intransitive posture verbs. Direction of change is a function of
V2 forms and their transitive and intransitive verb meaning. Translation relies on
directional prepositions up, down, around or end state positional expressions such
as at arm’s length or flat out.(224) a. òjè nwú       ólì ùkòdò khúáé.

khuae ‘raise,’ gbe ‘fell, reposition downward,’ khakha ‘spread,’ and ruan ‘tie’ occur
in series, respectively, with the V1 object manipulation verbs nwu, fi, ku and re. In
simple predications, V2 expresses an incremental change of positional state whose
final end state is open or unspecified, i.e. atelic. Addition of V1 in complex predica-
tions closes or specifies the end state. Telic specification thus differentiates simple
from complex change of positional state predications.(225) a. òjè fí             ólí óràn gbé.

730 | Aspect expressing complex predicatesTelic change of positional state predications restrict verb series co-occurrence.
While nwu khuae is grammatical, *fi khuae is disallowed. Likewise, re ruan is gram-
matical, whereas *nwu ruan is not.(226) a. *òjè fí             ólì ùkòdò khúáé.

          Aleke PRP.take wrapper tie
          ‘Alekei got heri wrapper tied around.’Typically, complex transitive change of positional state predications assert a telic
positional change for the NP2 referent. Some complex predications, however, assert
telic change for the NP1 referent (òjè ‘Oje’).(227) a. òjè nwú         ùdékèn héén.

      b. òjè héén          ùdékèn.
         Oje PRP.climb wall
         ‘Oje climbed the wall.’Predications of telic positional change restrict direct object. Although a broad class
of nouns occur as direct object for V2 in simple predications, only a subset appear as
NP2 in complex predications, e.g. heen ùdékèn ‘climb the wall’ immediately above
corresponds to nwu ùdékèn heen but heen ólí óràn ‘climb the tree’ below does not
correspond to nwu ólí óràn heen.(228) a. òjè héén          ólí óràn.

          Oje PRP.take the tree climb
          ‘Oje got up to the top of the tree.’V1 in change of positional state predications rejects pro-verb u ‘do,’ as does V2.(229) *òjè ú         ólì ùkòdò khúáé / nwú ólì ùkòdò ú.

appears with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object. It does not occur with NP1 or

      Oje PRP.raise the pot         the pot    PRP.raise-F
      ‘Oje has raised the pot.’     ‘The pot got raised.’The relation of V1 to complex predication arguments is more variable. Relative to
nwu khuae, V1 nwu appears with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object and shows
the meaning ‘carry.’(231) òjè nwú        ólì ùkòdò.
      Oje PRP.take the pot
      ‘Oje carried the pot.’V1 fi (òjè fí ólí óràn gbé ‘Oje felled the tree (down) flat out’) is more problematic.
Strict deconstruction fails. Although V2 gbe ‘reposition, fell’ as a transitive shape
accepts NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object, V1 fi disallows NP1 as subject and
NP2 as direct object. Neither appears as an intransitive shape with NP1 or NP2 as
subject.(232) a. òjè gbé        ólí óràn.

          ‘Oje projected/dropped the tree.’V1 nwu (òjè nwú ùdékèn héén [Oje PRP.take.hold wall climb] ‘Oje climbed up to the
top of the wall) is also problematic. Although V2 heen ‘climb, ascend’ appears with
NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object, V1 nwu fails to accept NP1 as subject and NP2
as direct object.(233) a. òjè héén        ùdékèn.

and V2 forms. In simple predicates, V2 forms express a state of posture for the hu-
man body. In corresponding complex predications, V2 signals end state of a posi-
tional change in posture. V1 and V2 vary in tandem. V1 expresses direction of change
(daa ‘raise,’ dee ‘lower’) and V2 the positional end state (muzan ‘stand,’ mehen ‘lie’).
Component verbs are not only paired but also strictly ordered. V2 muzan follows V1
daa, and V2 mehen follows V1 dee. Predication sense is ‘up’ or ‘down,’ respectively.(240) a. ólí ómòhè dáá       múzán'.
         the man PRP.raise stand
         ‘The man stood up.’
      b. ólí ómòhè déé       méhén'.
         the man PRP.lower lie
         ‘The man lay down.’    Complex intransitive predicates of posture change do not deconstruct in a strict
fashion. V2 muzan and mehen, retaining their posture senses, appear with NP1 as
subject and permit a locative vbi phrase.(241) a. ólí ómóhé múzán-í'      vbí úkpódè / múzán'-ì.
         the man PAP.stand-F LOC road            stand-F

         the man PAP.lie-F LOC mat         lie-F
         ‘The man lay on the mat / relaxed.’V1 occurs with NP1, but it does not occur exclusively as an intransitive verb. V1 daa
in simple transitive predications collocates with a body-part noun in direct object
position, e.g. éhòn ‘ear,’ to render English ‘listen.’ Similarly, V1 dee appears with the
verb re ‘arrive’ in series and, in the transitive, a body-part noun direct object. Both
734 | Aspect expressing complex predicatestransitive and intransitive dee re show the sense ‘lower, bend down.’ Thus neither
V1 verb occurs as a simple intransitive predication.(242) a. ólí òkpòsò ò ó dàà éhòn.
         the woman SC C raise ear
         ‘The woman is listening / is propping her ear in order to hear.’

expressing aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument
repositioning in discourse. Intransitive posture change predications restrict aspect.

polar questions.(246) dàà múzán.

       ‘It was this man alone who stood up.’11.9 Contact end state with locative
Emai complex predicates convey contact end state or contact exclusion. Transitive
V1 forms express change of positional state for a direct object referent while leaving
the nature of contact end state unspecified. V2, followed by a locative vbi phrase and
its referent, specifies point of contact or its exclusion for direct object and locative
referents. English translation of complex contact predications engages collocations
involving locative relational verbs (e.g. hang, lean, tie, press, stick, pound) and loca-
tive prepositions of contact (e.g. against), support (e.g. on, against), attachment (e.g.
on), inclusion/penetration (e.g. in) or exclusion (e.g. from).(248) a. òjè gbá      òhí nyé               vbí ólí óràn.

‘suspend’ and its following locative vbi complement in series. khuan predications
take a transitive or intransitive shape. As V1, transitive verbs of object manipulation
such as nwu, fi and ze occur. Predication sense is ‘hang in/on,’ the NP2 direct object
and vbi complement referents being in contact.(261) a. òjè nwú       ólì èkpà khúán vbí ólí óràn.

center’ and its locative vbi phrase in series. gon complex predications take a transi-
tive or intransitive shape. In transitives, the NP2 direct object referent comes in con-
tact with the vbi complement referent. As V1 in transitive predications, verbs of ob-
ject manipulation (e.g. roo ‘pick out’ and nwu ‘take hold’) occur. Predication sense is
‘lean against.’

occur as transitive or intransitive shapes. The attachment relation affects transitive
direct object NP2 (or intransitive subject) and vbi complement. Predication sense is

phrase convey a contact end state of penetration and inclusion. As V1, transitive
verbs occur that encode change of positional state (khuye ‘close’) or contact with an
implied change of positional state (khaan ‘pound’). The NP2 referent penetrates or is
inclusive to the vbi complement referent. No intransitive shapes appear as V1 in ze
predications. Predication sense is ‘VERB in, into.’

750 | Aspect expressing complex predicatesSynchronically, V1 forms appear as simple and complex predicates with related
meanings. As a simple predicate, khaan has sense ‘pound’ in Continuous aspect.(303) òjè ò ó khààn àgá.
      Oje SC C pound chair
      ‘Oje is pounding the chair (pieces of the chair) together.’When khaan appears in complex predicates with instrument verb re in series or with
Change of Location particle o, predication sense is ‘pound.’(304) a. òjè ò ó rè ìshé khààn àgá.

         Oje PRP.pound nail CL LOC the wood
         ‘Oje pounded a nail into the wood.’V1 khuye as a simple predicate has the synchronic sense ‘close,’ while khuye with
Change of State (CS) a has the sense ‘open’ (Chapter 9, 9.3.1.3).(305) a. ólí ómòhè khúyé       úkhùèdè.

         ‘The man opened the door.’V2 ze does not appear with NP1 or NP2 as intransitive subject, even in construction
with a locative vbi phrase. Nor is it the case that V2 ze appears with NP1 as transitive
subject and NP2 as direct object.(306) a. *àlèkè zé-ì                vbì ìwè. /    *ìshé zé'-ì.

          Oje PRP.penetrate nail LOC door
          ‘Oje stuck a nail in the door.’In fact, there is no synchronic simple predicate ze. However, reduplicated zeze has
the sense ‘congeal, become stiff.’ These ‘come together’ meanings seem at least
indirectly related to inclusion ze.

3 Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs
Emai inflection, auxiliary and preverb categories follow the grammatical subject
phrase and precede the initial verb of the predicate phrase. Inflection consists of
affirmative and negative aspect categories. They precede the auxiliary categories of
modality and relative tense, in that order. Preverbs follow auxiliaries.","[124, 125]"
"9.4.1 Projected change of location fi / ku a – fi / ku oSpatially projected change of location predications have in common a verb argu-
ment propelled through space, traversing ballistic fashion for some distance on the
horizontal plane. These predications occur with intransitive or transitive verbs.11
    Complex predicates of projected change of location with fi/ku a and fi/ku o and
an intransitive verb in series (e.g. vboo ‘jump’) take human, animate or inanimate
noun subjects in the singular.

of location. Change consists of a contiguous series of positions through space. Its
affect on transitive direct object or intransitive subject is either unbounded, so CS a,
or bounded by vbi complement of CL o. Number of affected participants is coded as
singular by fi or plural/mass by ku. Verbs in series in fi/ku a or fi/ku o constructions
include transitive khu ‘chase’ and intransitive la ‘run.’

‘strike so as to chop’ express spatially extended change of state. Each complex pred-
ication manifests a distributive function where the change of state for a transitive
direct object referent is dispersed relative to a bounded locative extent (ku o and its
locative vbi complement) or an unbounded extent (ku a). Predication sense trans-
lates English ‘away, aside’ and ‘all over,’ respectively, for unbounded and bounded
instances. Often the unbounded CS a examples lead to a cessation in referent exist-
ence or a condition of wastefulness or uselessness.
     Complex predicates expressing spatially extended change of state articulate
with transitive gbe ‘fell’ in series with ku and either CS a or CL o. gbe occurs with
neither CS a nor CL o in nonextended complex predicates.(188) a. ò gbé        éràn kú        à / *gbé éràn á.

that their final state ‘die’ arises by implication which CS a can confirm. Evidence for
this conclusion derives from ba kun ‘do in vain’ constructions (Chapter 11, 11.4).

9.5 Projected adherence
Complex predicates showing postverbal Projected Adherence (PAD) particle e pre-
ceded by either of the verbs fi or ku as second verb in series articulate projected
change of location with adherence. Particle e takes a human noun complement. As
initial verb in series, it requires a verb of projected motion. PAD e predications affect
an intransitive subject or transitive direct object that is projected to and adheres to a
PAD marked human referent.(253) a. òjè sán        ólì èkhòì fí     é     àlèkè.

tained contact with e complement referent. Contact is not sufficient. While compo-
nent verb fi ‘throw’ takes údò ‘stone’ or ùgbòfi ‘orange’ as direct object in simple
predications, it does not do so in complex PAD e predications, where èkhòì ‘worm’
satisfies the adherence condition.(259) a. *òjè fí          údò / ùgbòfi fí        é   àlèkè.

Complex predicates with postverbal particle lee express variation in temporal per-

or termination, depending on predication aspect. Predication sense is ‘already’ with
imperfect aspect and ‘already, finished’ with perfect aspect.(266) a. òjè é         ólí émàè léé.

"2.2.1 Verbal affixesEmai shows two derivational affixes that attach to verbs. They convey meanings
pertaining to speaker characterization of participant involvement in an event and to
the quantitative distribution of an event relative to intransitive subject, transitive
direct object or both.
    Speaker attitude is expressed by the Perseverative (PERS) prefix. It is realized by
a copy of the verb initial consonant (C) and the high tone vowel í-. Quantitative dis-
tribution is marked by Distributive (DS) suffix lo/lo/no, which is conditioned by verb
vowel and nasality. These affixes, which are mutually exclusive, vary in their co-
occurrence with auxiliaries and preverbs as well as in their expressive potential
under polarity and mood conditions.

        ‘They each ran into the house one after the other / all at once.’2.2.1.1 Perseverative prefix
The Perseverative prefix Cí specifies participant involvement in an event contrary to
speaker expectation. It translates English ‘still.’ Cí is limited to verbs and construc-
tions that convey state or change of state. It appears with intransitive stative verbs
such as da ‘be tall’ and dia ‘sit.’(15) a. ólí óvbékhán dí-dá'.

        the woman PAP.PERS-sit LOC the stool
        ‘The woman still sat in the stool.’Phonological conditions constrain the Perserverative. Stative or change of state
verbs that are not consonant initial, e.g. u ‘die’ (*ólí ómóhé í-ù [the man PAP.PERS-
die] ‘The man still died’) reject the Perseverative.
     The Perseverative fails with activity verbs. When alone or in series, intransitive
activity verbs do not take the Perseverative, as shown by gbe ‘dance’ (*ólí óvbékhán
gbí-gbé' [the youth PAP.PERS-dance] ‘The youth still danced’) and dan ‘wrestle’ (*élí
ívbékhán dí-dán' [the youths PAP.PERS-wrestle] ‘The youths still wrestled’), *ólí
óvbékhán kpí-kpáyé' òhí dán [the youth PAP.PERS-accompany Ohi wrestle] ‘The

activity verbs such as da ‘drink’ (*ólí ómóhé dí-dá' ólí ényò [the man PAP.PERS-drink

[the man PAP.PERS-cut the wood] ‘The man still cut the wood’), even though the
latter implies but does not assert a change of state.

          ‘The man still cut wood with the cutlass.’     Distributional facts reveal additional properties of the Perseverative. It severely
limits inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. Ci is confined to the Past perfect (right
edge high tone subject phrase). It fails with Present perfect, imperfect and prospec-
tive aspect.(18) ólí ómóhé rí-ré'            ópìà      híán óràn.
     the man PAP.PERS-use cutlass cut wood
     ‘The man still used a cutlass to cut wood.’    Perseverative fails to co-occur with auxiliary forms, as suggested by the unac-
ceptability of constructions with relative tense Anterior ke (*ólí óvbékhán ké' rí-ré ólí
ópìà híán óràn [the youth PAP.ANT PERS-use the cutlass cut wood] ‘The youth still

kha rí-ré ólí ópìà híán óràn [the youth PAP.HYP PERS-use the cutlass cut wood] ‘The

    The Perseverative rejects preverbs of any kind, attaching to neither verb re when
preverb gbo is present (*ólí óvbékhán gbó' rí-ré ólí ópìà híán óràn [the youth

The Distributive (DS) suffix is expressed by morphophonemic alternants lo, lo and
no. It attaches only to monosyllabic verb forms and differentially interacts with verb
transitivity. The Distributive specifies that a verb property is allocated to intransitive
subject referents or transitive direct object referents. It reveals few limitations rela-
tive to auxiliary, preverb, polarity or mood. When with Factative -i, the Distributive
occurs nearer the verb (é gbá-ló'-ì [they PAP.be.big-DS-F] ‘They are each big’).
     Morphophonemic shape of the Distributive is controlled by verb vowel height.
When the host verb exhibits a non-nasalized high vowel, either front (fi) or back
(ku), Distributive shape is -lo.(20) a. ò ó fì-lò ìyáín údò.
        he C hit-DS them stone
        ‘He is hitting each of them, one after the other, with a stone.’
     b. è     khú-ló           élí ívbèkhàn kú         à.
        they PRP.chase-DS the youths         disperse CS
        ‘They chased the youths away / They each chased away a youth.’When the verb shows a final nasal vowel (vun, tin), the Distributive is -no.(21) a. ó ló       vùn-nò     òtòì     á.
        he PRED break-DS ground CS
        ‘He will break up the ground repeatedly.’
     b. é    ló      tín-nó kú         à.
        they PRED fly-DS disperse CS
        ‘They will each one after the other fly away.’In all other vowel environments, Distributive shape is -lo.(22) ùkpíìhì ò ó sà-lò        ólí ómòhè.
     ant     SC C sting-DS the man
     ‘An ant is stinging the man repeatedly.’     The Distributive does not suffix uniformly across serial constructions. It attach-
es to the initial verb in a directional motion series involving intransitive manner (la)
and direction (o ‘enter’), provided the subject is plural (e). A distributive or collec-
tive interpretation of a plural subject is allowed. However, the Distributive disallows
construal of a directional motion event with singular subject as repeated over time
(*ò lá-ló ó vbì ìwè [he run-DS enter LOC house] ‘He ran into the house repeatedly’).
34 | Morphology(23) è    lá-ló'         ó     vbì ìwè.
     they PRP.run-DS enter LOC house
     ‘Each ran one after the other into the house.’
     ‘They all at once ran into the house.’The Distributive reveals a more limited interpretation with directional motion serials
consisting of a transitive verb (si ‘drag’) and a directional verb (o ‘enter’). For these,
only the distributive interpretation is available (*élì ìkpòsò sí-ló élí éwáà ó vbì ìwè
[the women drag-DS the mats enter LOC house] ‘The women dragged the mats all at
once into the house’).(24) ólì òkpòsò sí-ló       élí éwáà ó        vbì ìwè.
     the woman PRP.drag-DS the mats enter LOC house
     ‘The woman dragged the mats one after the other into the house.’With a verb in series that adds an instrumental or comitative participant, the Dis-
tributive suffix fails. It does not attach to instrumental re ‘take/use’ or comitative
kpaye ‘accompany, replace.’(25) a. *è     ré-ló        élí ópìà        bén-nó élí éràn.
         they PRP.use-DS the cutlasses cut-DS the trees
         ‘They used each of the cutlasses to cut each of the trees.’
     b. *ólí óvbèkhàn kpáyé-ló                élí ímòhè dán.
         the youth     PRP.accompany-DS the men wrestle
         ‘The youth wrestled with each of the men.’
     c. *élí ívbèkhàn kpáyé-ló            élí ímòhè bén éràn.
         the youths    PRP.replace-DS the men cut trees
         ‘The youths cut trees in place of the men.’     Additional restrictions affecting the Distributive suffix derive from predication
type and the marking of grammatical number on subject and direct object. When
suffixed to intransitive verbs, the Distributive requires a plural subject (e.g. é ‘they’
not ó ‘he’).(26) é / *ó gbá-ló'-ì.
     they he PAP.be.big-DS-F
     ‘They were each big.’    When the Distributive attaches to monotransitive verbs, whether in series or
not, number marking of subject and direct object appears controlled by predication
type. One predication type with the Distributive requires a plural subject (e) and
                                                                 Affixal morphology | 35plural direct object (ívbèkhàn). A plural direct object and a singular subject (*ò khú-
ló ívbèkhàn kú à [he PRP.chase-DS youths disperse CS] ‘He chased youths away’) is
unacceptable, as is a singular direct object with either a plural subject (*è khú-ló ólí
óvbèkhàn fí à [they PRP.chase-DS the youth project CS] ‘They chased the youth
away’) or a singular subject (*ò khú-ló ólí óvbèkhàn fí à [he PRP.chase-DS the youth

     they PRP.chase-DS youths disperse CS
     ‘They chased youths away.’Distributive with a second predication type (e.g. ban ‘remove’) requires a plural
direct object (íkpùn) and allows a singular or plural subject. Singular direct objects
are unacceptable, whether subject is singular (*ò bán-nó úkpùn [she PRP.remove-DS
cloth] ‘She removed her cloth’) or plural (*è bán-nó úkpùn [they PRP.remove-DS
cloth] ‘They each removed their cloth’).(28) a. è     bán-nó           íkpùn / *bán           íkpùn.
        they PRP.remove-DS cloths       PRP.remove cloths
        ‘They removed their clothes.’
     b. ò bán-nó            íkpùn.
        she PRP.remove-DS cloths
        ‘She removed her clothes (one piece after the other).’The Distributive with a third predication type exhibits even more flexibility as to
argument expression of grammatical number. Verbs such as ben ‘cut’ allow a plural
direct object with either a singular or plural subject. They also allow a singular di-
rect object with a singular subject, although not a singular direct object with a plu-
ral subject (*élí ímòhè bén-nó ólí óràn [the men cut-DS the tree] ‘The men of whom
there are many cut the tree’). When verb arguments are exclusively singular, the
action is construed as distributive, i.e. as being repeatedly performed.(29) a. élí ímòhè bén-nó        élí éràn.
        the men PRP.cut-DS the trees
        ‘The men cut the trees one after other / *Each man cut the trees.’
     b. ólí ómòhè bén-nó         élí éràn.

        ‘The man cut the trees one after the other.’

        the man PRP.cut-DS the wood
        ‘The man chopped the wood (repeated action on single piece).’
36 | MorphologyThe Distributive with a fourth verb type (e.g. sa ‘sting’) manifests a broader range of
singular argument acceptability and interpretation. Verbs like sa take a plural direct
object and singular or plural subject. Event interpretation with plural subject is
collective; it is distributive with singular subject.(30) a. élí ííhí sá-ló'          màì / *sá'          màì.
        the ants PAP.sting-DS us         PAP.sting us

        ‘The ant stung us (each of us one after the other).","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]"
"2.1.1 Noun inflectionEmai evinces a remnant gender system of number bearing prefixes attached to nom-
inal roots. Aspects of this system are also evident in prefixes attached to postnomi-
nal modifiers as well as pronouns expressing varying syntactic functions.
     Number inflection determines the shape of some nominal and modifier stems.
For a limited set of nominal roots belonging to human, animate and inanimate clas-
ses as well as body-part locus and abstractions, a number contrast is marked by
vowel prefixes. There is a tendency for singular to be realized by back, mid vowels
(o- and o-) and plural by front, non-low vowels (i-, e-, e-). It is only the mid low vow-
el (a-) that is used for singular and plural marking. Tone of the prefixal pair does not
correlate with number; nor does it correlate with gender.
     Overt number marking leading to noun class pairs and thus genders is not com-
prehensive in Emai. The number of nouns in each remnant gender is variable, some
exhibiting only a single root. And in contrast to gender systems of the Bantu type
found in other parts of Africa, no root participates in more than one noun class pair.

      Each Emai prefix pair (i.e. gender) correlates to some extent with semantic enti-
ties that fall within the classes human, animate, inanimate, abstract and/or locus.
Based on their semantic profiles, few remnant genders reflect a single identifiable
semantic class. Of Emai’s 11 genders, all with mid back vowels designating singular
(i.e. o- ~ i-, o- ~ e-, o- ~ e-, o- ~ i-) exhibit human nouns except o- ~ a-; it shows body-
part items. The gender u- ~ i- is the most clearly non-human, since it reveals all clas-
ses except human. For the most part, common nouns for flora and fauna in these
gender classes reflect a generic or basic level of abstraction. Several classes identify-
ing fauna, moreover, identify entities reflective of a pastoral lifestyle (e.g. sheep,
cow and goat), despite the fact that such a lifestyle is incompatible with the current
ecological environment of the Emai. In addition, Emai gender classes tend not to
include root forms that reflect an agricultural lifestyle (e.g yam, maize and beans).
An overall impression of Emai gender is available in Table 3, which pairs the 11 gen-
ders with each of five semantic classes.
      Based on Table 3 and the list of noun forms in each gender, we identify the se-
mantic character of Emai gender classes. The a- ~ e- gender incorporates animate
and inanimate entities: ákhè, ékhè ‘ceramic pot,’ áwà, éwà ‘dog.’ The a- ~ i- gender
subsumes human, animate and inanimate roots with recognizeable social values.
This gender applies to humans denoting lifecycle stages, birds at both the unique
beginner and mid taxonomic levels and an inanimate stem involving a complex
word form whose derivational history is no longer transparent: ágèlè, ígèlè ‘pubes-
cent boy’, àlèkè, ìlèkè ‘pubescent female,’ áfìánmì, ífìánmì ‘bird,’ ávbé'ì, ívbé'ì ‘vil-
lage weaver bird,’ ágádágòdò, ìgádágòdò ‘padlock.’

type. In the e- ~ i- gender there is émèlá, ímèlá ‘cow’. And the e- ~ e- gender has one
root: éwè, éwè ‘goat.’
     Body part extremities are identified by the o- ~ a- gender: óbò, ábò ‘hand, fore-
leg,’ òè, àwè ‘foot, hind leg.’ The o- ~ e- gender includes human, animate, inanimate
and locus noun roots. It has roots for mid level rodent, unique beginner and socially
recognized humans as well as roots for inanimates, tree and calabash bowl, as well
as an animal body-part extremity: ófè, éfè ‘rodent, rat,’ ótù, étù ‘person, people,’
óìbó, éìbó ‘whiteman,’ óràn, éràn ‘tree, wood, stick,’ òkpàn, èkpàn ‘calabash bowl,’
óhìà, éhìà ‘hoof, claw.’ Limited to roots denoting animate nouns and socially recog-
nized humans is the o- ~ i- gender. It includes root forms for animals that are wild
(bush) or domesticated, for the human female, offspring and blood relative, and for
social roles antagonistic to societal welfare or reflective of traditional Emai occupa-
tions: óvbèè, ívbèè ‘monkey,’ óghòóghò, íghòóghò ‘female sheep,’ òkpòsò, ìkpòsò
‘woman, female,’ ómìòò, ímìòò ‘blood relative,’ òrúán, ìrúán ‘in-law,’ óghìàn, íghìàn
‘enemy,’ óhùà, íhùà ‘hunter.’
     The o- ~ e- gender prefixes attach primarily to human root forms, marriage
roles, socially defined positions at the fringe of human society, animate roots for
domestic fowl as well as insects and an abstract root with negative value: ódòn,
édòn ‘husband,’ óhà, éhà ‘wife,’ óìà, éèà ‘person, human being,’ ómèmè, émèmè
‘lunatic, madman,’ ódíòn, édíòn ‘elder,’ óbò, ébò ‘oraclist, diviner,’ òkhòì, èkhòì
‘worm,’ óókhò, éókhò ‘fowl, hen,’ òbè, èbè ‘bad, evil.’ A single abstract root with
positive value denotation defines o- ~ e-: òsèn, èsèn ‘goodness, good.’ In the o- ~ i-
gender one finds roots identifying human social roles in addition to affixal forms
reflecting nominalization (prefix added to a verb root) and synthetic compounds
(prefix added to verb plus noun). This gender also has root forms denoting male and
female humans in various life cycle stages as well as social roles and occupations:
òmòhè, ìmòhè ‘man,’ óvbèkhàn, ívbèkhàn ‘unmarried youth,’ òvíén, ìvíén ‘slave,
bonded one,’ òíé'n, ìíé'n ‘co-wife, female rival, ómòò, ímòò ‘friend, companion,’
ògbàmá , ìgbàmá ‘post pubescent male,’ óèjè, íèjè ‘chief, titled man,’ ózèwàìn,

     The u- ~ i- gender hosts the largest number of noun roots. This gender incorpo-
rates primarily inanimate and animate roots with some from body-part locus. It has
forms denoting animal body parts, insects, artifacts and an abstract noun recogniz-
ing a basic temporal distinction: ùbèlè, ìbèlè ‘calabash, gourd,’ úgbàn, ígbàn ‘blade

      Within Emai’s grammatical system, agreement or concord linked to gender is no
longer functional. Perfect aspect and prospective aspect evince no morphological
agreement marking. However, a remnant agreement system is evident in imperfect
aspect, where continuous and habitual morphemes are distinguished by tone.
      Continuous aspect in the third person is expressed by high tone ó, preceded
immediately by a low tone subject concord (SC) marker (ò) and a lexically headed
subject constituent with low tone at its right edge (ólí ómòhè, élí ímóhè).(1) ólí ómòhè / élí ímóhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
    the man      the men SC C eat the food
    ‘The man is / The men are eating food.’    Habitual is similarly framed except for tone, which in third peson is conveyed
by low tone ò preceded by a subject concord marker with high tone (ó) and a lexical-
ly headed constituent with right edge high tone (ólí ókpósó ná, élí íkpósó ná).(2) ólí ókpósó ná / élí íkpósó ná      ó ò shèn úkpùn.
    the woman this the women these SC H sell cloth
    ‘This woman sells / These women sell cloth.’     As clausal expressions in the imperfect illustrate, neither number nor gender
impacts shape of the agreement marker. There is no effect on subject concord pho-
nological shape by indexing of grammatical number in the subject constituent (pre-
determiner ólí ~ élí with o- ~ e-) or by gender contrast of lexical head nouns
(ókpósó/íkpósó with o- ~ i- or ómòhè/ímóhè with o- ~ i-). Number and gender distinc-
tions in agreement marking are thus neutralized.
     Remnant agreement is evident within noun phrases, where a select group of ad-
jectives must agree in number with their head noun. Emai attributive phrases
marked by the particle li index grammatical number on adjective forms
(òkhúá/èkhúá, óbín'/ébín') that modify gender bearing nouns. Hence, the grammati-
cal number conveyed by the initial vowel of an attributive adjective (o- for singular
and e- for plural) varies in agreement with grammatical number of the initial vowel
of the head noun (e- for singular and i- or e- for plural).

e- gender characterizes some predeterminers and postdeterminers, modifiers that
precede or follow a head noun, respectively. Included are postdeterminer stems that
serve as kindred modifiers and existential quantifiers in addition to a predeterminer
serving as definite article. Numerals (e.g. òkpá ‘one,’ èélè ‘four’) and universal quan-
tifiers (e.g. èrèmé ‘all,’ òdóòdé ‘each’) show no number prefixation, as with demon-
stratives (e.g. nà ‘this/these,’ áìn ‘that/those,’ nòì ‘next’).ólìná [ónìná] ‘this kind’                     élìná [énìná] ‘these kind’

characterize Emai’s associative (genitive) morpheme -si. These prefixes involve an
extremely limited grammatical classification of locus or place, contrastively evident
today only with a few place nouns, e.g. ìwè ‘dwelling,’ as possessum and a posses-
26 | Morphologysor such as òjè in íwé ésì òjè ‘Oje’s temporary dwelling’ and íwé ísì òjè ‘Oje’s perma-
nent dwelling’. The é- stem, i.e. ésì, requires that one construe ìwè as a temporary
dwelling such as one might find near a farmplot, whereas the í- stem construes the
dwelling as more permanent, occurring as a house in a township. For expression of
all other possession relations, regardless of possessum noun, the form that appears
in associative expressions is ísì (Chapter 4, 4.3.3.1)2.1.3 Adverb inflectionIdeophonic adverbs (e.g. khùó) show an alternation between zero (Ø) and an i- pre-
fix that correlates, respectively, with the adverb in clause final position or clause
initial topic position.(3) a. ójé híán'    ùkèlè khùó / *ìkhùó.
       Oje PAP.cut morsel whoosh whoosh
       ‘Oje cut a morsel with a whooshing sound.’
    b. ìkhùó / *khùó,       ójé híán'   ùkèlè.
       whoosh whoosh, Oje PAP.cut morsel
       ‘With a whoosh, Oje cut a morsel.’The Ø ~ i- alternation is limited to ideophonic adverbs that refer to rate of move-
ment, spatial position, posture or sound. In English, these meanings often lexicalize
in verbs. Representative samples of each semantic subclass are shown below.2Rate:
ìbìán, ìbìánbìán / bìán ‘flash resulting from sharp contact’
ìdédédé / dédédé ‘scurried, extremely quick pace’
Spatial Distance:
ìháún, ìháúnháún / háún ‘physical distance exceeding accepted norm’
ìpìén, ìpìénpìén / pìén ‘with small bits positioned here and there’
Movement and Posture:
ìgùàghó / gùàghó ‘jerky fashion’
ìgúáhí / gúáhí ‘crumpled state’
Sound:
ìbèú / bèú ‘banging sound of a hitting activity’
ìbèú / bèú ‘sound of loud bursting into tears’Ideophonic adverbs that refer to manner rather than sound, rate, distance or motion
fail to accept the prefix i- in focus position.

yóò ‘whooshing’The prefix ì- is disallowed with ideophonic adverbs in topic position that exhibit
reduplication of bisyllabic high tone stems or triplication of monosyllabic high tone
stems. These adverbs tend to express manner.gbírígbírí ‘jerkily’                     dúdúdú ‘very dark’

attaches to simple predicates only in perfect aspect: Present and Past. It never oc-
curs with imperfect or prospective aspect, each of which overtly marks the verb
phrase with an aspect marker such as imperfect Continuous (C) ó or prospective
predictive (PRED) ló.(4) a. ólí ómóhé lá'-ì.                 ólí ómòhè lá-ì.
       the man PAP.run-F                the man PRP.run-F
       ‘The man ran.’                   ‘The man has run.’
    b. ólí ómòhè ò ó lá / *ò ó là-ì.
       the man SC C run SC C run-F
       ‘The man is running.’
    c. ólí ómóhé ló      là vbì ìwè / *ló       là-ì vbì ìwè.
       the man PRED run LOC house PRED run-F LOC house
       ‘The man will run in the house.’Factative -i never co-occurs with any auxiliary (e.g. relative tense ke in *ólí ómóhé ké
lá-ì [the man ANT run-F] ‘The man ran afterward’) or preverb (e.g. aspectualizer gbo
in *ólí ómóhé gbó' lá-ì [the man ADD run-F] ‘The man ran too’). Factative -i only
occurs when auxiliary and preverb positions for a single verb predicate are vacant.
      Factative -i manifests polarity and mood restrictions as well. Although incom-
patible with prohibitive and negative statements, which require preverbal forms, it
is also incompatible with verbs in the imperative, where no overt marker need pre-
cede the verb. Provided a bare predicate, the Factative appears in polar questions.
28 | Morphology(5) ólí úkpùn káká-ì?
    the cloth PRP.become.dry-F
    ‘Has the cloth dried?’     In addition to aspect, auxiliary and preverb limitations, Factative -i imposes a
bare condition on the verb constituent and a displacement condition on arguments
of transitive verbs. To start, Factative is constrained by subcategorization properties
of the verb. With bare intransitive verbs, the Factative occurs.(6) a. ólí úkpùn káká-ì.
       the cloth PRP.become.dry-F
       ‘The cloth has dried.’
    b. ólì óvbèkhàn dá-ì.

       ‘The youth is tall.’
    c. ólí ómòhè lá-ì.
       the man PRP.run-F
       ‘The man has run.’When a bare intransitive verb takes a following adjunct or argument, Factative -i
shows asymmetric distribution. Bare intransitive verbs with locative adjuncts
marked by preposition vbi retain Factative -i regardless of adjunct occurrence in
canonical or noncanonical (focus marked li/ni) constructions.(7) a. ólí ómóhé múzán-í'        vbí úkpódè.
       the man PAP.stand-F LOC road
       ‘The man stood on the road.’

       road alone PF the man           PAP.stand-F
       ‘It was on the road alone that the man stood.’With a following argument marked by preposition vbi, bare intransitive verbs show
Factative -i only when the argument (e.g. èkìn) corresponds to a noncanonical posi-
tion, e.g. focus marked by li/ni or interrogative pronoun in information questions.(8) a. ólí ómóhé ó'            vbì èkìn.

       where the man     PAP.enter-F
       ‘Where did the man enter?’With some limitations, Factative -i attaches to a bare transitive verb whose direct
object is displaced to focus or question position in discourse. When a direct object
occupies focus li/ni or question word position, a transitive verb requires Factative -i.(9) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì / *shén'.

       ‘It was yam that the man sold.’
    b. émé' ólí ómóhé shén'-ì / *shén'?
       what the man PAP.sell-F PAP.sell
       ‘What did the man sell?’     Limiting this generalization are complex predicates where a transitive verb ei-
ther shows a postverbal particle or a double object complement, occurs in series
with another verb, or incorporates grammaticalized elements. Factative -i is prohib-
ited when a verb stands in construction with a postverbal particle, either Change of
State a, Change of Location o, Applicative li/ni or Temporal Perspective lee.(10) a. ólí ákhè lí ólí ómóhé gbé'       /    *gbé'-ì         á.

        ‘It was eba (prepared cassava) alone that the youth finished eating.’Factative -i is disallowed by verbs in series. When a direct object corresponds to a
focus li/ni constituent or interrogative pronoun, no verb in series (e.g. nwu, re, re,
hian) attracts the Factative.(11) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé nwú' / *nwú-í'             ré.

       what the man PAP.use PAP.use-F            cut wood
       ‘What did the man use to cut wood?’Factative -i fails to occur where an extant transitive verb shows a complex multi-
morphemic diachronic character. For instance, zawo ‘see’ has derived historically
from Deductive auxiliary za ‘must have’ and the verb ghoo (reduced to wo) ‘per-
ceive.’ zawo does not take Factative -i.(12) ólì òkpòsò lí ólí ómóhé záwó' / *záwó'-ì.
     the woman PF the man PAP.see PAP.see-F
     ‘It was the woman that the man saw.’Despite these limiting conditions, adverbial adjuncts, particularly those of time and
place, do not constrain Factative. When a direct object occupies focus position or
corresponds to an interrogative pronoun and a temporal adjunct (òdè) follows a
bare transitive verb, Factative -i remains obligatory.(13) ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé shén-í' / *shén'            òdè.
     the yam PF the man PAP.sell-F PAP.sell           yesterday
     ‘It was the yam that the man sold yesterday.’2.2 Affixal morphology
Affixal morphology in Emai subsumes processes of verbal affixation, nominaliza-
tion, compounding and reduplication. Each results in lexemes with distinct mor-
phological make up.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]"

  Complements of bi reject the quasi-placeholder nouns óìà ‘person’ and émì ‘thing,’ regardless of
modification (*ólí ómò réè bí óíà / émí lí ó dé' ré' [the baby PRP.take.after like person thing R he fall
arrive] ‘The baby takes after the person / the thing that fell’).

  The verb moe frequently anchors figurative expressions in which it collocates with an abstract or
body-part noun direct object. For these collocations, subject phrase tone marking by Past perfect
distinguishes figurative from corresponding literal meanings.ólí ómóhé móé'         èwàìn.                   ólí ómóhé móé'        únù.

‘The man is very influential.’                  ‘The man is brave.’In several respects, moe constructions contrast with those of English ‘have.’ moe is not used to
express spatial relations between two entities, as English ‘have’ does (*ólì èkpètè mòè ògèdè vbí
ókhúnmí óì [the stool PRP.have plantain LOC top it] ‘The stool has plantain on top of it’). Direct
object position for moe does not allow an associative phrase specifying or implying a possessor
noun distinct from the subject referent.*ì mòè        ópíá     ísì òì.                 *ólí ómòhè mòè        ópíá mè.

tions.ólí ópíá      ísì èé      ríì     mé vbí óbò.
the cutlass ASS your PAP.be my LOC hand
‘The cutlass of yours is in my hand. / I have your cutlass in my hand.’The verb moe also collocates with nominalized intransitive verbs to convey an intensity function vis-
à-vis constructions with an intransitive predicate and Habitual aspect.ólí ómòhè mòè           òjàjà.                  ólí ómóhé ó ò jàjá.

  Subject position with moe differentially constrains the quasi-placeholder nouns óìà ‘person’ and
émì ‘thing.’ óìà occurs only when modified by a relative clause (óíá lí ólí ómóhé sá' óí ávbòhà mòè
íkèké [person R the man PAP.slap him shoulder PRP.have bicycle] ‘The person whom the man
slapped on the shoulder has a bicycle’) or attributive phrase (óíá lí óbé / *óíà ó ò mòè éghó' [person R

of modifier type (*émí lí ólí ómóhé dé-í' vbì èkìn mòè àwè èéà [thing R the man PAP.buy-F LOC mar-
ket PRP.have legs three] ‘The thing that the man bought in the market has three legs’).

  moe construction direct object position restricts the quasi-placeholder nouns óìà ‘person’ and émì
‘thing.’ It accepts óìà only in an idiomatic sense, ‘person of influence’ (ólì òkpòsò mòè óìà / éìà [the
woman PRP.have person persons] ‘The woman has influence’). Even when modified this is so (ólì
òkpòsò mòè éíá lì èkhúá [the woman PRP.have persons R important] ‘The woman is related to im-
portant people’). In contrast, émì occurs when unmodified (ólì òkpòsò mòè émì [the woman

èkìn [the woman PRP.have thing R she PAP.buy-F LOC market] ‘The woman has something that she
bought in the market’).
9 Postverbal particles in complex predicates
Emai verb phrases show complex predicates framed by postverbal particles in con-
struction with verb forms. Each verb-particle predication type is associated with
multiple semantic functions. Nonetheless, each in its principal function signals
either Change of Possession (Applicative, APP) li/ni, Change of Location (CL) o,
Change of State (CS) a, Projected Change of Location with Adherence (PAD) e, or
Temporal Perspective (TEMP) lee.(1) a. òjè shén      émà lí      ólì ònwìmè.
       Oje PRP.sell yam APP the farmer
       ‘Oje sold yam to the farmer.’
    b. òjè nwú        émà ó vbí úkpódè.
       Oje PRP.take yam CL LOC road
       ‘Oje put yam onto the road.’
    c. òjè gbé          ólí ákhè á.
       Oje PRP.break the pot CS
       ‘Oje broke the pot.’
    d. òjè óhó         ólì úshé'n kú         é   ólì òkpòsò.
       Oje PRP.blow the powder disperse PAD the woman
       ‘Oje blew the powder all over the woman.’
    e. òjè é          ólí émàè léé.
       Oje PRP.eat the food TEMP
       ‘Oje finished eating all the food.’     Two Emai particles specify event aspect (CS and TEMP), while three characterize
argument structure. Particle co-occurrence relates to function. Temporal Perspective
lee combines with each of the other particles. Change of State, Change of Location
and Projected Adherence are mutually exclusive. Change of State and Change of
Location each combine with Applicative li/ni, although not when the latter marks
Change of Possession recipient. Instead, li/ni in these constructions with CS a and
CL o codes a benefactive semantic role.(2) a. òjè ò ó fòò ólí ómí á lì          àlèkè.
       Oje SC C cool the soup CS APP Aleke
       ‘Oje is cooling down the soup for Aleke.’
    b. òjè ré        óbò ó vbí ébè lí           àlèkè.
       Oje PRP.put finger CL LOC paper APP Aleke
       ‘Oje signed the paper for Aleke.’
518 | Postverbal particles in complex predicates     Particle tone value in transitive predications tends to harmonize or contrast
with its preceding verb depending on structural conditions. Moreover, particles
exhibit tone behavior distinct from adverbials, since they fail to induce high tone
spread at right edge of a preceding direct object constituent. No postverbal particle
serves as a simple predicate.
     In this chapter as well as Chapters 10, 11 and 12 addressing other complex predi-
cations, we detail a range of structural properties for each predication type. These
include component verbs and related noun phrases as well as restrictions concern-
ing inflectional aspect, polarity and mood, possible repositioning of arguments to
discourse prominent positions and predication response to aspectually sensitive
question types. The latter take the shape of discourse frames incorporating
émé'/émí' NP ú ‘What did someone do?’ and émé'/émí' ú ‘What happened?’.1(3) a. émé' ójé ú'-ì?
       what Oje PAP.do-F
       ‘What did Oje do?’
    b. émé' ó ú'?
       what it PAP.happen
       ‘What happened?’9.1 Applicative
Complex predicates coded by postverbal Applicative (APP) li/ni and its nominal
complement express recipient or beneficiary relations conveyed in English by
‘to/for’ or ‘from.’ Component verbs are transitive or intransitive.
     Applicative form varies according to its complement. Its li exponent occurs with
a lexical noun complement. The ni form appears with a pronoun complement or
when the Applicative is stranded in postverbal position, as in positive focus (PF)
constructions marked by li/ni.(4) a. ólì òkpòsò shén       émà lí   ònwìmè.
       the woman PRP.sell yam APP farmer
       ‘The woman sold yam to the farmer.’
    b. ólì òkpòsò shén       ólí émà ní áìn.
       the woman PRP.sell the yam APP him
       ‘The woman sold the yam to him.’
    c. ólí ónwímé nà lí ólí ókpósó shén'      émà ní.
       the farmer this PF the woman PAP.sell yam APP
       ‘It was this farmer who the woman sold yam to.’
                                                                  Applicative | 519Applicative li/ni complements require dative pronouns (e.g. áìn ‘him,’ Chapter 5),
which differ in phonological shape from accusative pronouns (e.g. óì ‘him’). Applic-
ative li/ni does not accept place nouns (e.g. áfúzé' ‘Afuze’) or ellipted associative
phrases of place marked by ésì/ísì.(5) àlèkè shén      ólí émà ní áìn / *óì / *áfúzé' / *ésì ònwìmè.
    Aleke PRP.sell the yam APP him him Afuze ASS farmer
    ‘Aleke sold the yam to him.’    In complex predicates with verbs of financial transaction (shen ‘sell,’ de ‘buy’)
and thus possession change, Applicative li/ni codes event Recipient.(6) a. ólì òkpòsò shén    émà lí     ònwìmè.
       the woman PRP.sell yam APP farmer
       ‘The woman sold yam to the farmer.’

       the woman PRP.buy yam APP farmer
       ‘The woman bought yam for the farmer.’Recipient li/ni also co-occurs with transitive verbs of object manipulation, e.g. nwu
‘take hold’ and roo ‘pick up.’ Predication sense is ‘give.’ Independent of the li/ni
construction, manipulation verbs like nwu with only a direct object complement
convey the sense ‘carry,’ not ‘give.’(7) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà lí    ònwìmè.
       the woman PRP.take yam APP farmer
       ‘The woman gave yam to the farmer.’

       the man PRP.pick.out arrow APP Ohi
       ‘The man picked out an arrow for Ohi.’Recipient li/ni predications also accept transitive verbs like re, which fail as simple

520 | Postverbal particles in complex predicates     Recipient li/ni predications require permanent possession exchange. Entity
transfer from one person to another or location change without possession change
is not sufficient, as with the projection and release verb fi ‘throw.’(9) *ólì òkpòsò fí        ùgbòfì lí    ònwìmè.

    ‘The woman threw an orange to the farmer.’Recipient li/ni predications contrast with complex allative ‘take’ predications
marked by ye ‘move to’ in series. Allative conveys temporary possession change.(10) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà yé        ònwìmè.

pressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as
discourse repositioning of arguments. Recipient li/ni predications do not restrict
aspect. They inflect for Present perfect (right edge low tone subject phrase) and Past

tion to recipient. These are beneficiary, aversive and addressee. Each is briefly illus-
trated below.
     li/ni complements identify event beneficiary, an argument of the predication
that benefits in some way from an event (Blake 2001). Beneficiary functions occur
with simple predicates (hóó ‘wash) and complex predicates (nwú móé ‘hold’).

stricted. Their subjects and direct objects correspond to focus position constituents
but li/ni complements do not.(18) a. ólí ókpósó nà lí ó hóó'                úkpùn lí   ólì ònwìmè.

event participant is avoided (Blake 2001). Aversive complements are limited to hu-
man nouns. They reject nouns for nonhuman, animate (ólí áwà) or inanimate place
(ólì èvbòò). li/ni aversives are found with intransitive and transitive verbs.

fies event addressee (Chapter 13, 13.4.3). Obligatory in these constructions is verb in

Complex predicates consisting of transitive or intransitive verbs and CL o express
change of location. CL o takes a complement headed by locative preposition vbi. The
semantic nature of vbi complements influences the functional character of CL predi-
cations. Other functions associated with CL o include temporal demarcation, spatial
demarcation, quantitative demarcation, displacive commodity and state change.
     Change of location predications with CL o express a change of location for tran-
sitive direct objects (e.g. ìtáì ‘tie’ and úkpúì ‘rope’).(27) a. ólí ómòhè dín     ìtáì     ó vbì ùrùn.
        the man PRP.tie necktie CL LOC neck
        ‘The man tied on a necktie / put on a necktie.’

        the woman PRP.tie rope CL my LOC arm
        ‘The woman tied a rope onto my arm.’Verbs in CL o predications often exhibit a sense shift when occurring as a transitive
predicate. With verbs of object manipulation, e.g. nwu ‘take hold,’ the meaning
contrast is between ‘carry’ with a direct object and ‘put’ with direct object and CL
phrase.2(28) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà.
        the woman PRP.take yam
        ‘The woman carried / *put yam.’
     b. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà ó vbí úkpódè.
        the woman PRP.take yam CL LOC road
        ‘The woman put / *carried yam onto the road.’A substantial inventory of transitive manner of manipulation verbs appear in CL o
predications that translate English ‘put.’ Some are illustrated below.3

        the man PRP.thread bead CL LOC string
        ‘The man put / threaded beads onto a string.’A few object manipulation verbs (e.g. re ‘take,’ ban ‘remove’) fail as simple predi-
cates. They require a CL phrase or some other suitable change of state predicate.(30) a. àlèkè ré        íkìó      ó vbì èò / *ré íkìó.
        Aleke PRP.take mascara CL LOC face take mascara
        ‘Aleke put mascara onto her face.’

        Oje PRP.remove cloth CL LOC ground remove cloth
        ‘Oje removed his clothes onto the ground / undressed.’CL o requires a vbi phrase with a following noun phrase as complement. For the
change of location function, vbi complements are headed by place nouns or nouns
construable as place. Human noun complements of vbi are ungrammatical.(31) *ólí ómòhè dín       úkpùì ó vbí ólí óvbèkhàn.
      the man PRP.tie rope CL LOC the youth
      ‘The man tied a rope onto the youth.’When the noun in a vbi complement refers to a body part possessum (óbò), either of
two syntactic relations obtain. If the corresponding possessor (mé) appears external
to the possessum phrase, i.e. between CL o and vbi, the possessum is construed as
inalienably related to possessor. If the possessor appears within the possessum

     the man PRP.tie rope CL my LOC arm
     ‘The man tied a rope onto my arm.’vbí complements in CL o predications accept locative pronouns that are deictic (èvbò
‘there yonder’ and ááìn ‘there) or nondeictic (o).(33) ólì òkpòsò nwú      ólí émà ó vbì èvbò / ááìn / ò.
     the woman PRP.take the yam CL LOC yonder there          it
     ‘The woman put the yam onto there yonder / there / it.’    Complex predicates with CL o display additional properties in expressions of
aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as argument reposition-
ing. CL o predications inflect for Present and Past perfect as well as imperfect Con-
tinuous, with CL o tone and verb tone harmonizing in transitive constructions.4(34) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú       émà ó vbí úkpódè.

Predication subjects, direct objects and locative complements correspond to focus
position marked by li/ni.(38) a. òjè lí ó nwú'          ólí émà ó vbí úkpódè.

        road     this PF Oje PRP.take the yam CL
        ‘It was this road that Oje put the yam on.’     Five other functions associate with CL o. In large measure, these functions re-
flect verb semantics (change of state or change of location) or vbi phrase nominal.
One function occurs when vbi complement is headed by a time nominal (e.g. éghè
‘time’). In such instances CL o predications convey event temporal goal.(39) a. ólì òkpòsò é         émàè ó vbí éghè.

        ‘The woman ate on time.’

        Oje ASS Oke PRP.schedule war        CL LOC 9.days today
        ‘The Oje of Oke scheduled the war for a fortnight from today.’Complex predicates with CL o, instead of specifying a final destination, articulate a
locative reference point function for an event. This occurs when predication verb
                                                           Change of location | 529specifies change of state or change of position for the subject argument, as in fu
‘waste,’ ghogho ‘break,’ and fi ‘leave.’(40) a. ìbòbòdí fú'         ó vbí ímè.

        the woman PRP.leave the cloth CL LOC house
        ‘The woman left the cloth at home.’A third function results when vbi’s complement consists of a numeral. The complex
CL o predicate must then express a change of quantitative state. Either intransitive
subject or transitive direct object undergoes a change of quantitative state.(41) a. ólì òkpòsò híán       ólí úì   ó vbì ódè èvá.
        the woman PRP.cut the rope CL LOC parts two

        the rope PRP.cut CL LOC parts two
        ‘The rope got cut into two parts.’Complex CL o predicates also express a reciprocal exchange function. A subject or
direct object argument undergoes exchange relative to a vbi marked argument. In

verbs express state change. The vbi complement must show the nondeictic locative
pronoun o. The verbs involved denote a physical dimension or physical appearance.
State change predications with o vbì o express scalar, incremental change with no
inherent end point. Most but not all of these predications require Continuous or
Habitual aspect.

Change of State (CS) a in its principal function asserts or confirms a telic condition
for a change of material state. It forms complex predicates with verbs that are in-
transitive, transitive or both. CS a distribution in complex transitive predications
reveals eight essential patterns outlined in the following.","[540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556]"
"13.4.4.1 Transitive een
The verb een ‘know’ is found with S-complements and VP-complements. Concerning
S-complements, een accepts indicative, indirect question and conditional comple-
ments, the latter only in nondeclaratives such as interrogatives or negative state-
ments. Like other assumptive verbs, een does not allow subjunctive li complements.(115) a. ólí ómòhè één-í         khí ólì òkpòsò gbé       ólí ófè.

      d. ólí ómòhè í ì       èén sí       ólì òkpòsò gbé      ólí ófè.
         the man SC NEG know COND the woman PRP.kill the rat
         ‘The man doesn't know whether the woman killed the rat.’With een, S-complements constrain cross-clause subject identity and subject corre-
spondence to interrogative and substitutive pronouns. Subject identity across ma-
trix and embedded clause varies by complement type. For indicatives, subject iden-
tity is optional, since subject takes either a logophoric (yon) or personal (o) pronoun.(116) a. ólí ómòhè één-í          khì yòn gbé      ólí ófè.
         the man PRP.know-F IND LOG PRP.kill the rat

marks matrix and complement subject as conjoint or disjoint.12(117) a. ólí ómòhè één        ébé' ó í'          gbé ólí ófè.

         the man PRP.know how she LOG PAP.MAN kill the rat
         ‘The man knew how she killed the rat.’When een and its indirect question complement are embedded under e ‘say,’ the
indirect question accepts a logophoric pronoun (yon) to establish conjoint reference
with ‘say’ subject. Disjoint reference still obtains with respect to een subject.(118) ò é           óí khì òjè één         ébé' yón í' gbé ófè.
      she PAP.say it IND Oje PRP.know how LOG PAP.MAN kill rat

A complex predicate consisting of verbs mama ‘plan’ and re ‘arrive’ takes li and khi
complement types. It appears with li S-complements obligatorily extraposed from
direct object position. Moreover, mama re accepts this complement only when either
Resultative auxiliary za occurs in the matrix clause or when mama re subject corre-
sponds to a focus constitutent preceding li/ni. Under either condition, mama re
accepts subjunctive complements.(142) a. ójé zá'        mámá óì ré       lí    ólí óvbékhán yè        ímè.

         ‘It was Oje who planned that the youth should go to the farm.’mama re permits indicative when matrix subject corresponds to a focus constituent.
But regardless of subject discourse relation, mama re rejects conditional and indi-
rect question complements.(143) òjè lí ó mámá'        óì ré     khí á     ló     yè       ímé ákhò.
      Oje PF he PAP.plan it arrive IND one PRED move.to farm tomorrow
      ‘It was Oje who planned it that one will go to the farm tomorrow.’    Constructions with mama re restrict subject identity across clauses and S-
complement correspondence to interrogative and substitutive pronouns. With li,
cross clause subject identity is not permitted, since complement subject position
takes personal (o) pronouns but not logophoric (yon) pronouns. And as the immedi-
ately preceding example suggests, khi complements with mama re disallow subject
identity across clauses.(144) ójé zá'         mámá óì ré      lí   ó / *yón í       yè  ímè.

they require Past perfect and Resultative za, or Past perfect and a constituent in
positive focus position that corefers to subject. Relative to polarity and mood, mama
re constructions fail as imperatives, prohibitives, negatives and polar questions.","[863, 864, 865, 866, 867, 868, 869, 870, 871]"

to linear order, modifier compatibility and grammatical relation type. Transitive
verbs that assume a gerundive shape follow their direct object arguments. The direct
object never follows the gerund (*úèmí éhéén ‘eating fish’).

     fish eating PAP.cause me illness
     ‘Eating fish has made me ill.’Gerundives never occur as head of an Associative ísì phrase whose complement (e.g.
èhèèn) bears a direct object relation (*úèmí ísì èhèèn zé mé èmìànmì [eating ASS fish
cause me illness] ‘The eating of fish made me ill’). When gerundive forms follow
Associative ísì, the phrase shows a purposive ‘for’ interpretation.(39) ò gbá-ló        émí ísì úgbèmí.
     he PRP.tie-DS thing ASS dancing
     ‘He put on his costume for the purpose of dancing.’     Noun phrase arguments of transitive gerundives do not accept nominal modifi-
ers. For instance, gerundive constructions take neither definite predeterminer ólí
(*ólí émá úèmí zé' mé èmìànmì [the yam eating PAP.cause me illness] ‘The yam eat-
ing made me ill’) nor kindred postdeterminer élìyó (*émá élìyó úèmí zé' mé èmìànmì
[yam that.kind eating PAP.cause me illness] ‘Eating yam of that kind made me ill’).
     Complement position preceding a gerundive form is limited to direct object ar-
guments. Even when framed by Locative vbi or Associative ísì, gerundive comple-
ment position rejects a locative adjunct: íwé or vbì ìwè in (*íwé úgbèmí / úgbèmí vbì
ìwè zé ókpósó ghònghòn [house dancing / dancing LOC house PRP.allow woman

PRP.allow village be.happy] ‘The chief's drinking made the village happy’).
     Gerundive phrases are not restricted to core grammatical relations subject and
direct object. They appear as objects of locative preposition vbi.(40) ólí ómòhè béé         vbí émáé úèmí.

exhibit an optional split structure for a limited number of verbs. Intransitive verb
mianme ‘be difficult’ accepts an argument gerundive noun phrase as grammatical
subject. It also shows a split gerundive in which the argument precedes mianme and
the gerundive follows in direct object position. The argument requires obligatory
modification (definite predeterminer ólí). Reversing constituent order is unaccepta-
ble; the gerundive never precedes mianme and its argument never follows (*úhìànmí

multiple verb roots that otherwise occur as serial verb sequences or to verb stems
that incorporate a suffix. These lexemes reflect four semantic classes: conditions,
entities, instruments and places.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"

Evaluative transitive verb eghen ‘please’ occurs with only one S-complement type. It
is found with subjunctive li extraposed from subject position. eghen never occurs
with khi, si or indirect question complements.(218) ò éghén         ólí ómòhè lí      ó í       ròò     ólì òkpòsò.

      ‘It pleased the mani to marry / that hei should marry the woman.’Predications with eghen limit cross clause subject coreference and complement
correspondence to interrogative or substitutive pronouns. Subject coreference
across clauses is disallowed due to complement extraposition and consequent oc-
currence of the expletive pronoun in matrix subject position. Personal pronouns (o)
appear as complement subject, but logophorics (yon) do not. Moreover, coreference
is required between matrix direct object (ólí ómòhè) and complement subject (ó).(219) ò éghén        òjè lí    ó / *yón í       ròò      ólì òkpòsò.

Transitive verb khoon ‘satisfy’ accepts one S-complement type. It requires indicative
khi complements that are obligatorily extraposed along with a matrix clause that
manifests Perfect Negation or a Dubitative auxiliary (bia and vba). Dubitatives re-
quire an interrogative construction (Chapter 3, 3.1.3.2.2). As for the indicative com-
plement, it must show prospective Anticipative aspect. Neither Predictive, perfect
nor imperfect is permitted in khoon’s khi clause. Other S-complement types with
khoon, subjunctive li, conditional si or indirect question, are ungrammtical.(222) a. ó ì      khòòn ólí ókpósó khì ò ló          nyè émàè.

         it PRP.DUB satisfy the woman IND she ANTI cook food
         ‘Could it really satisfy the womani that shei was about to cook?’    Constructions with khoon restrict subject coreference between complement and
matrix clause due to extraposition and expletive pronoun appearance in matrix
subject position. As complement subject, personal pronouns occur but logophoric
pronouns do not. Coreference is required, however, between matrix direct object
and complement subject.(223) ó ì      khòòn ólí ókpósó khì ò / *yòn ló          nyè émàè.
      it NEG satisfy the woman IND she LOG ANTI cook food

elements forming complex synthetic compounds correspond to verb phrase syntac-
tic constituents. Prefixes in complex synthetic compounds include i-, o- and a-.
     Complex synthetic compound lexemes of one structural type consist of two verb

event end state or result, with the noun serving as predication direct object. These
lexemes encode relatively few entities, covering selected food items, games, social
roles, and abstract conditions.

locative preposition vbi and its complement. Prefixes marking these compounds are
a- and o-. In resulting lexemes, transitive or intransitive verbs occur with a locative
vbi phrase, as they do in corresponding syntactic phrases. Corresponding syntactic
phrases show non-literal or metaphorical interpretations.

pretation ‘human condition characterized by VERB LOCATIVE.’ànwùvbèó ‘attraction, appeal’

clause. Lexemes of this nature are formed from verb or copular clauses or pronomi-
nally headed relative clauses. There are three classes.
     One lexeme class involves a copula (COP) predicate and accompanying pre- and
post-copula nominals of identical phonological shape. Equational Identity copula
khi ‘be equivalent,’ pre- and post-copula position nominals, and Identity subject í
frame lexemes denoting indefinite, generic reference. They have the meaning ‘con-
dition characterized by NOUN COP NOUN.’émìíkhèmí ‘anything, whatever’
  émì ‘thing,’ í ID, khi COP, émì ‘thing’
éghèíkhèghé ‘any time, whenever’
  éghè ‘time,’ í ID, khi COP, éghè ‘time’
édèíkhèdé ‘whichever day, any day’
  édè ‘day,’ í ID, khi COP, édè ‘day’     Lexemes of a second class denote a bodily condition. They employ the verb vbi
‘happen to’ preceded by the nonhuman noun émì and followed by the human noun
ómò. Resulting lexemes have the idiomatic interpretation ‘bodily condition charac-
terized by NOUN VERB NOUN.’

These compounds are derived from relative clauses headed by relative pronoun
ólì/ónì. Lexemes of this nature have the interpretation ‘condition characterized by
PRONOUN NOUN VERB.’ The verb ne ‘pass’ used in some of these expressions de-
rives from the neighboring Ora vernacular, as does the relative pronoun shape ónì.ònìhóònè ‘one who farts’

One type of synthetic compound serves to identify a referent with respect to its parti-
tive character. Members exhibit a prefix+verb+noun morphological shape. Verbs in
partitive function synthetic compounds are sometimes difficult to identify synchron-
ically. Today they occur as verbs with limited distribution or even as adverb or ad-
jective forms that we assume derived historically from verbs.7 There are six synthetic
compound classes that bear on nominal classification.
     One synthetic compound class is formed with prefix ú-/í-, a post-verb noun and
an elided form of the verb kpa ‘apportion, give equal amounts, divide’ (òjè kpá émà
ó vbì ìtásà [Oje PRP.apportion yam CL LOC bowl] ‘Oje apportioned yam into the
bowls’). kpa compound sense results from apportioning a nominal referent by iso-
lating one part of its homogeneous mass or aggregate, any portion of which, when
isolated, is materially equivalent to any other portion.8 Lexemes in this class refer to
abstractions, locations (body part and otherwise), natural kinds and artifacts.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"

pectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as discourse repositioning of ar-
guments.14 Complex lee predications restrict aspect partially. They allow Present and
Past perfect as well as imperfect Continuous. The temporal boundary brought into
perspective varies according to aspect. lee predications in the perfect assert that
terminal temporal boundary is actualized, e.g. ‘finish,’ while lee predications in the
imperfect assert that onset temporal boundary is actualized. lee tone in canonical

"13.4.3.1 Ditransitive gue li hon
The verb gue ‘present, indicate’ is limited to ditransitive li hon constructions. It ac-
cepts an Applicative li/ni marked addressee and the verb hon in series. These pre-
cede an S-complement: indicative, subjunctive or indirect question. Constructions
with gue li hon do not accept conditional, direct quote or VP-complements.(100) a. ójé gúé'           lí òhí hón khì àlèkè gbé              ófè.

ment types with assumptive verbs, except nwu kue re, which extraposes its comple-
ment, are embedded as direct objects. Complements for these verbs never
correspond to interrogative pronouns or manner-demonstrative ìyó ‘so.’ However,
assumptive verbs diverge in their acceptance of subject identity across complement

Negation never allow logophoric pronouns. Additional properties emerge from

Sentence focus constructions reaffirm or negate the factuality of the proposition
expressed by their matrix clauses. Each construction consists of two structural com-
ponents: a clause initial form, érí' for affirmation and kì for negation, followed by a
matrix clause. Relative to its matrix clause, each construction restricts subject noun
phrase, inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs, polarity and mood, and occurrence in
subordinate clauses.","[424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429]"

and contrastive ódàn (*óvbékhán élìyó / ódán ú' óì [youth that.kind different.kind
PAP.do it] ‘A youth of that kind / different kind did it’).
      Subjects of monotransitive u permit most impersonal pronouns: demonstrative
óáìn, ònà, and ónóì (óáìn / ònà / ónóì ú óì [that.one this.one next.one PRP.do it] ‘That
one / This one / The next one did it’), universal quantifiers collective èrèmé and
distributive òdóòdé (èrèmé / òdóòdé ú' óì [all each.one PAP.do it] ‘All / Each one did

merals such as collective èvèvá and cardinal èvá in a bare phrase (èvèvá / èvá ú' óì
[both two PAP.do it] ‘Both / Two did it’). Cardinals also appear in a partitive phrase
(èvá vbí élí ívbékhán ú' óì [two LOC the youths PAP.do it] ‘Two of the youths did it’).

NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. It requires a third person accusative pro-
noun, accepting singular (óì) or plural (íyàìn) forms. It never allows first or second
person accusative pronouns. Moreover, it fails to admit proper names or bare com-
mon nouns of any animacy value (*ò ú ójé / áwà / óvbèkhàn [he PRP.do Oje dog
youth] ‘He did Oje / a dog / a youth’).(95) ò ú           óì / íyàìn / *mè / *é.
     he PRP.do it them me / you
     ‘He did it / them.’Direct objects for monotransitive u also restrict syntactically elaborated common
nouns. They reject human nouns (ómò) modified by definite article ólí/élí (*ò ú ólí
ómò [he PRP.do the infant] ‘He did the infant’) or postdeterminers such as áìn or ósò
(*ò ú ólí ómò áìn [he PRP.do the infant that] ‘He did that infant’, *ò ú ómó ósò [he
PRP.do infant certain] ‘He did some infant’).
    However, u direct object accepts impersonal pronouns. It shows demonstrative
óáìn, ònà and ónóì (ò ú óáìn / ònà / ónóì [he PRP.do that.one this.one next.one] ‘He
did that one / this one / the next one’), universal quantifier èrèmé (ò ú èrèmé [he
PRP.do all] ‘He did all), existential quantifiers partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (ò
ú ósò / óvbèé [he PRP.do certain.one another.one] ‘He did a certain one / another
one’), and numerals, e.g. cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá (ò ú èvá / èvèvá [he
PRP.do two both] ‘He did all / two / both’). Unacceptable are kindred pronouns.
    Noun phrase positions framed by monotransitive u differentially correspond to
discourse defined positions. Subjects correspond to li/ni focus or topic constituents
(àlèkè). Direct objects never correspond to these constituents.(96) a. àlèkè lí ó ú'              óì.

        ‘As for Aleke, she did it.’Monotransitive u subject and direct object show contrasting interrogative pronouns.
Subject corresponds to question word óé' ‘who’ but never émé' ‘what.’ Direct object
corresponds to interrogative pronouns émé' and ékà but not óé'.(97) a. óé' / *émé' ó ú'    óì?

        ‘It was that way that she did it.’     Monotransitive u constructions are relatively unconstrained as to polarity and
mood. They appear as imperatives (ù óì [do it] ‘Do it’), prohibitives (é è ú óì [you PR
do it] ‘Don't do it’), negative statements (ólì òkpòsò í ì ù óì [the woman SC NEG do it]

PRP.do it] ‘Did the woman do it?’).
     u construction predicates manifest many properties typically associated with
verbs. Although they restrict verbal affixes, they do not limit verb inflection, auxilia-
ries, preverbs, postverbal particles and temporal adjuncts. Regarding verbal affixes,
monotransitive u rejects Perseverative prefix Ci- and Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no, as
in *élí ímòhè ú-ló óì [the men PRP.do-DS it] ‘Each of the men did it.’ Under bare verb
phrase conditions, however, u accepts Factative suffix -ì, as when direct object posi-
tion is vacated in information questions (émé' ólí ómóhé ú'-ì? [what the man PAP.do-
F] ‘What did the man do?’).
     Monotransitive u inflection reveals perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.(100) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ú           óì. /   ólí óvbékhán ú'       óì.

         the youth       ANTI do it
         ‘The youth is about to do it.’      Monotransitive u accepts a wide range of auxiliaries. It allows deontic Hortative
í (ólí ómòhè í ù óì [the man HOR do it] ‘The man should do it’), epistemic modality
judgment types rational DED za (ólí ómòhè záà ú óì [the man PRP.DED do it] ‘The

‘The man didn't do it, did he?’) and bia (ólí ómóhé bíá' ú óì? [the man PAP.DUB do it]
‘Did the man actually do it?’) as well as assumptive CONC rere (ólí ómóhé ré'rè ú óì17
[the man PAP.CONC do it] ‘Even the man did it’) and HYP kha (ólí ómóhé khà ú óì
[the man PAP.HYP do it] ‘The man would have done it’).
      Monotransitive u also permits relative tense, although Anterior ke requires a po-
lar interrogative (ólí ómòhè kéè ú óì? [the man PRP.ANT do it] ‘Did the man do it
464 | Be, do, happen and haveafterward / anymore?’), while Subsequent kpe does not (ólí ómóhé kpé' ú óì [the man
PAP.SUB do it] ‘The man still did it / did it despite pending conditions’).
     In monotransitive u constructions, preverbs are partially limited. Although
manner-demonstrative ìyó and ìná are disallowed, u ‘do’ accepts phasal aspectual-
izers: Repetitive che (ólí ómòhè chéè ú óì [the man PRP.REP do it] ‘The man did it

also did it’) and Punctual ghe (ólí ómóhé ghé' ú óì [the man PAP.PCT do it] ‘The man
just did it’).
     Monotransitive u also permits boundary aspectualizers: Conative òó (ólí ómòhè
ó ó' ù óì [he man SC CON do it] ‘The man went to do it’), Egressive mo, requiring the
Temporal Perspective particle (ólí ómòhè móò ú óì léé [he man PRP.EG do it TEMP]
‘The man almost finished doing it’), Ingressive ya (ólí ómòhè yà ú óì [the man PRP.IG

ú óì [he man PAP.PAB do it] ‘The man used to do it’) and Past Absolute mo (ólí
ómóhé mó' ú óì [he man PAP.PAB do it] ‘The man at one time did it’).
     Monotransitive u allows most evaluative preverbs with the exception of woo ‘in-
stead.’ u constructions are found with duu (ólí ómóhé dú'ú ú óì [the man PAP.EVAL
do it] ‘The man for no reason did it’) and kuku (ólí ómòhè kúkù / *wóò ú óì [the man
PRP.POEV PREV do it] ‘The man afterall did it’).
     Not limited in monotransitive u constructions are temporal preverbs: kpao (ólí
ómòhè kpáò ú óì [the man earlier PRP.do it] ‘The man initially did it’), gue (ólí ómòhè
gúé ú óì [the man PRP.unexpectedly do it] ‘The man did it quicker than expected’),
bobo (ólí ómóhé bó'bò ú óì [the man PAP.promptly do it] ‘The man promptly did it’)
and tua (ólí ómòhè túá ú óì [the man PRP.hurriedly do it] ‘The man hurriedly did it’).
     Monotransitive u restricts a few subject attributive preverbs. Ungrammatical are
dábo ‘deliberately’ and totóbo ‘intensely.’ Grammatical are dóbo (ólí ómóhé dó'bò ú
óì [the man PAP.mistakenly do it] ‘The man mistakenly did it’), miti (ólí ómóhé mí'tì

and dégbe (ólí ómòhè ò ó dègbé ù óì [the man SC C carefully do it] ‘The man is steadi-
ly doing it’).
     Unrestricted in monotransitive u constructions are quantity preverbs. One finds
the forms dobo (ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì ú óì [the man PAP.REFL him do it] ‘The man did it
himself’) and gba (élí ímóhé gbá' ú óì [the men PAP.COL do it] ‘The men did it to-
gether’). Intensifier quantity forms also occur, although each requires a detransitiv-
ized predicate phrase with partitive vbi: zemi (ólí ómòhè zémì ú vbì ò [the man
PRP.ABSI do LOC it] ‘The man did a lot of it’) and zeze (ólí ómòhè zézè ú vbì ò [the

ing place reject Recurrent preverb a and its nonreferentiality condition (*ólí údò ríì

Existential (EXT) constructions occur with predicates ri and e: NP ri vbi o and NP e
vbi o. They assert the existence of a referent (in the manner of a pointing gesture).
Canonical EXT constructions framed by ri exhibit three distinguishing features: an
initial right edge high tone noun phrase, a low tone verb, and a vbi complement
showing the nondeictic locative pronoun. Those formed with e manifest the same
distinguishing features except for tone marking on the initial noun phrase, which
varies according to inflection and auxiliary marking.

        the woman PAP.be LOC it
        ‘There’s the woman.’
     b. ólì òkpòsò í ì         è vbì ò.
        the woman SC NEG be LOC it
        ‘It isn't the woman.’    EXT clauses with ri limit polarity and mood expression. Like its locative coun-
terpart, EXT ri does not accept Perfect Negation (*ómòhè í ì rì vbì ò [man SC NEG be
LOC it] ‘There isn’t a man, that we know’). As well, it fails as a polar interrogative
(*ómóhé rì vbì ò? [man PAP.be LOC it] ‘Is there a man?’). EXT ri constructions never
appear as imperatives or prohibitives.
    EXT e constructions are similarly constrained. They occur as negative state-
ments or polar interrogatives, but never as imperatives or prohibitives.(77) a. ómòhè í ì        è vbì ò.
        male SC NEG be LOC it
        ‘There isn't a male (that we knew).’
     b. ómòhè í ì        è vbì ò?
        male SC NEG be LOC it
        ‘Isn’t there a male (that we knew)?’     EXT constructions exhibit few properties normally associated with verbs. Those
with ri inflect for aspect in an irregular fashion. Since ri only takes a right edge high
tone subject phrase, it appears to inflect for the Past perfect. Its own low tone, how-
ever, is irregular. Typically, Past perfect verb tone is high downstep. EXT ri fails to
inflect for imperfect or prospective aspect. Beyond inflection, EXT constructions
with ri permit no auxiliaries and preverbs. Neither epistemic Certaintive ma, relative
tense Subsequent kpe, aspectualizer preverb Repetitive che nor evaluative preverb
kuku, among others, is acceptable (*ólí ómóhé má' / kpé' / ché' / kú'kù rì vbì ò [the
man PAP.CER SUB REP EVAL be LOC it] ‘There’s certainly / yet / again / after all the
man that we knew’).
     EXT e constructions restrict inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs somewhat dif-
ferently. They only inflect for imperfect Habitual. EXT e rejects all other aspects,
including prospective Predictive (*ómóhé ló è vbì ò [male PRED be LOC it] ‘There will
be a male’).(78) ómóhé ó ò è vbì ò.
     male SC H be LOC it
     ‘There’s (usually) a male.’
454 | Be, do, happen and haveRelative to auxiliaries, EXT e constructions allow epistemic Certaintive ma (ómòhè í ì
má è vbì ò [male SC NEG CER be LOC it] ‘There surely isn't a male that we know’) but
no other modality forms, including irrealis Hypothetical kha (*ómóhé khà é vbì ò
[male PAP.HYP be LOC it] ‘There would have been a male that we know’). Construc-
tions with EXT e reject relative tense auxiliaries, for example Subsequent kpe
(*ómòhè í ì kpé è vbì ò [male SC NEG SUB be LOC it] ‘There isn't yet a male despite
the pending condition’).
     In EXT e constructions preverbs are highly restricted. They admit evaluative ku-
ku (ómòhè í ì kùkú è vbì ò [male SC NEG EVAL be LOC it] ‘There isn't a male after all
that we know’) but no other preverb.
     EXT construction noun phrases exhibit asymmetrical properties. The position
preceding ri or e takes nominative pronouns (e.g. o). The complement of vbi, regard-
less of realis or irrealis condition, permits only the nondeictic locative pronoun o.(79) a. ó rì          vbì ò.
        he PAP.be LOC it
        ‘There he is.’
     b. ó ì        è vbì ò.
        he NEG be LOC it
        ‘It isn't one. / There isn’t one.’     Subject position in EXT constructions limits NP type but not animacy or its syn-
tactic shape. EXT subject allows common nouns regardless of animacy or syntactic
elaboration by, for instance, definite article ólí/élí.(80) a. ómóhé / ólí ómóhé rì            vbì ò.

tives ná and áín (ólí ómóhé ná / áín rì vbì ò [the man this that PAP.be LOC it] ‘There’s

subject position are contrastive kindred (ódàn), contrastive demonstrative (nóí),
contrastive existential quantifier (óvbèé) as well as collective numerals (e.g. èvèvá)
and universal quantifiers (èrèmé, òdóòdè).
     EXT subjects accept one nonlexical modifier type. They permit head nouns
modified by relative clauses. But they disallow phrases with associative ísì (*ékpá ísì
òhí rì vbì ò [bag ASS Ohi PAP.be LOC it] ‘There’s Ohi's bag’) or attributive li (*ómóhé

‘There aren’t any / There are none that we know’) and deictic kindred élìyó (élìyó rì

existential quantifier (óvbèé) as well as collective numerals (e.g. èvèvá) and univer-
sal quantifiers (èrèmé, òdóòdè).

subject does not correspond to a constituent in any of the positions focus (*ómóhé lí

Verb de conveys ‘discover, reach a mental state’ with indicative khi. It fails with

shape. Perceptive verbs take khi and IQ S-complements. Neither accepts li or si.
Concerning aspect, perceptive verbs allow perfect and imperfect, although the latter
only if the complement is also imperfect. They restrict polarity and mood expres-
sion, failing as imperatives and prohibitives but appearing as negative statements
and polar interrogatives. Complement types with perceptive verbs are embedded as
direct objects. With these verbs, complements do not consistently correspond to
interrogative pronouns, and they reject the discourse pronoun ìyó ‘so.’ Subject iden-
tity across complement and matrix clause in perceptive verb constructions is disal-
lowed. Additional properties emerge from consideration of each verb.","[876, 877, 878, 879, 880, 881, 882]"
"3.2.1.1 Phasal che, gbo, se, ghe
Phasal aspectualizers constrain auxiliary categories, sentence mood and polarity.
They also constrain one another, particularly with respect to linear order. Repetitive
(REP) che ‘again’ brings an event, including its participants, into perspective and
asserts event repetition over an interval on the time axis.
118 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs(52) ólí ómóhé ché'       é émà.
     the man PAP.REP eat yam
     ‘The man again ate yam.’Additive (ADD) gbo ‘too, also’ brings an event into perspective and asserts addition-
al event occurrence over a time expanse. Re-occurrence denoted by gbo is not lim-
ited by participant identity or temporal immediacy, as it is with Repetitive che.(53) ólí ómóhé gbó'        é ólí émàè.
     the man PAP.ADD eat the food
     ‘The man also ate the food / ate the food too.’Durative (DUR) se ‘still, continue, keep on’ profiles an event subphase and asserts
phasal duration relative to a definite point on the time axis. It often carries an impli-
cation that the speaker expected some other event to intervene or take its place.(54) ólí ómòhè séè          é vbí ólí émàè.
     the man PRP.DUR eat LOC the food
     ‘The man has still eaten / has continued to eat from the food.’Punctual (PCT) ghe ‘just’ highlights an event subphase or the event itself and asserts
proximity of phasal onset or endpoint, depending on aspect, to time of utterance or
some other temporal reference point.(55) a. ólí ómóhé ghé'        híán ólí óràn.
        the man PAP.PCT cut the wood
        ‘The man just cut the wood.’
     b. ólí ómòhè ò ó ghé è émáé ènyáà.
        the man SC C PCT eat food just.now
        ‘The man is just eating food right now.’    Relative to one another, phasal aspectualizers exhibit a complex linear order
scheme. Durative se precedes but never follows Repetitive che (ólí ómóhé sé' chè ré
óbò só ólí éwè [the man PAP.DUR REP use hand touch the goat] ‘The man still
touched the goat with his hand again’), Additive gbo (ólí ómòhè séè gbò é vbí ólí

or Punctual ghe (ólí ómóhé sé' ghè khóó à [the man PAP.DUR PCT bathe CS] ‘The
man still just bathed / The man just continued to bathe’).
    Among Repetitive, Additive and Punctual forms order is flexible. Each precedes
or follows the other: ólí ómòhè chéè gbò é émàè [the man PRP.REP ADD eat food]
‘The man has again eaten food too’, ólí ómòhè gbóò chè é émàè [the man PRP.ADD

shoulder] ‘The man just slapped Oje on the shoulder too’.
      Phasal aspectualizers, particularly when compared to boundary forms, evince
few restrictions regarding aspectual inflection, modality and relative tense. Phasal
preverbs tend to occur with each aspect. Repetitive che allows Past perfect (ólí
ómóhé ché' é émàè [the man PAP.REP eat food] ‘The man again ate food’), Present
perfect (ólí ómòhè chéè é émàè [the man PRP.REP eat food] ‘The man again has eaten
food’), imperfect Continuous (ólí ómòhè ò ó ché è émàè [the man SC C REP eat food]
‘The man is eating food again’), prospective Predictive (ólí ómóhé ló chè é vbí ólí
émàè [the man PRED REP eat LOC the food] ‘The man will again eat from the food’),
and prospective Anticipative (ólí ómòhè ló chè é émàè [the man ANTI REP eat food]
‘The man is about to eat food again’). Repetitive che fails in the Habitual.
      Additive gbo appears in Past perfect (ólí ómóhé gbó' é ólí émàè [the man
PAP.ADD eat the food] ‘The man also ate the food / ate the food too’), Present per-
fect (ólí ómòhè gbóò é ólí émàè [the man PRP.ADD ate the food] ‘The man has also
eaten the food’), imperfect Continuous (ólí ómòhè ò ó gbó è ólí émàè [the man SC C

Predictive (ólí ómóhé ló gbò é ólí émàè [the man PRED ADD eat the food] ‘The man
will also eat the food’), and Anticipative (ólí ómòhè ló gbò é ólí émàè [the man ANTI
ADD eat the food] ‘The man is about to eat the food too’).
      Durative se occurs in Present perfect (ólí ómòhè séè é vbí ólí émàè [the man
PRP.DUR eat LOC the food] ‘The man has still eaten / has continued to eat from the
food’), imperfect Continuous (ólí ómòhè ò ó sé kpè ólì ìtásà [the man SC C DUR wash
the plate] ‘The man is still washing / is continuing to wash the plate’), prospective
Anticipative (ólí ómòhè ló sè é ólí émàè [the man ANTI DUR eat the food] ‘The man is
still about to / is about to continue to eat the food’), but not Past perfect, imperfect
Habitual or prospective Predictive.
      And Punctual ghe takes Past perfect (ólí ómóhé ghé' híán ólí óràn [the man
PAP.PCT cut the wood] ‘The man just cut the wood’), imperfect Continuous (ólí
ómòhè ò ó ghé è émáé ènyáà [the man SC C PCT eat food just.now] ‘The man is just
eating food now’), prospective Anticipative (ólí ómòhè ló ghè é ólí émàè? [the man
ANTI PCT eat the food] ‘Is the man about to just eat the food?’), but not Present per-
fect, imperfect Habitual or prospective Predictive.
120 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs     Relative to modality, phasal aspectualizers show differential constraints. Fol-
lowing deontic Hortative í are Repetitive che (ólí ómòhè í chè kpé ólì ìtásà [the man
HOR REP wash the plate] ‘The man should wash the plate again’), Additive gbo (ólí
ómòhè í gbò é ólí émàè [the man HOR ADD eat the food] ‘The man should eat the
food too’), Durative se (ólí ómòhè í sè é ólí émàè [the man HOR DUR eat the food]
‘The man should still eat the food’), and Punctual ghe (ólí ómòhè í ghè é ólí émàè [the
man HOR PCT eat the food] ‘The man should just eat the food’).
     Phasal aspectualizers restrict occurrence with epistemic modality. This is par-
ticularly true of Punctual ghe, less so of Durative se, and even less of Repetitive che
and Additive gbo. Repetitive che follows each epistemic form, with Dubitatives and
assumptive rere requiring an interrogative: (ólí ómòhè záà chè é émàè [the man
PRP.DED REP eat food] ‘The man must have eaten food again’), (ólí ómóhé zá' chè é
émàè [the man PAP.RES REP eat food] ‘As a result the man again ate food’), (ólí
ómóhé má' chè é émàè [the man PAP.CER REP eat food] ‘The man surely ate food
again’), (ólí ómòhè vbáà chè é émàèé? [the man PRP.DUB REP eat food] ‘Could the
man really have eaten food again?’), (ólí ómóhé vbá' chè é émàè? [the man PAP.DUB

PRP.DUB REP eat food] ‘Has the man actually eaten food again?’), (ólí ómóhé bíá'
chè é émàè? [the man PAP.DUB REP eat food] ‘Did the man actually eat food
again?’), (ólí ómòhè rérè chè é émàè? [the man PRP.CONC REP eat food] ‘Did the man
even eat food again?’), and (ólí ómóhé khà ché é ólí émàè [the man PAP.HYP REP eat
the food] ‘The man would have again eaten the food’).
     In quite similar fashion, Additive gbo follows each epistemic auxiliary except
assumptive rere: (ólí ómòhè záà gbò é émàè [the man PRP.DED ADD eat food] ‘The
man must have eaten food too’), (ólí ómóhé zá' gbò é émàè [the man PAP.RES ADD
eat food] ‘As a result the man also ate food’), (ólí ómóhé má' gbò é émàè [the man
PAP.CER ADD eat food] ‘The man surely ate food too’), (ólí ómóhé vbá' gbò é émàè?
[the man PAP.DUB ADD eat food] ‘Could the man really eat food too?’), (ólí ómòhè
vbáà gbò é ólí émàè? [the man PRP.DUB ADD eat the food] ‘Could the man really
have eaten the food too?’), (ólí ómóhé bíá' gbò é ólí émàè? [the man PAP.DUB ADD

[the man PRP.DUB ADD eat the food] ‘Has the man actually eaten the food too?’),
and (ólí ómóhé khà gbó é émàè [the man PAP.HYP ADD eat food] ‘The man would
have eaten food too’).
     Durative se follows each epistemic auxiliary except Certaintive ma. With as-
sumptive rere as well as Dubitatives, se requires an interrogative: (ólí ómòhè záà sè é
ólí émàè [the man PRP.DED DUR eat the food] ‘The man must have continued to eat
the food’), (ólí ómóhé zá' sè é ólí émàè [the man PAP.RES DUR eat the food] ‘As a

(ólí ómòhè bíà sè é ólí émàè? [the man PRP.DUB DUR eat the food] ‘Has the man
                                                             Preverb categories | 121actually continued to eat the food?’), (ólí ómòhè séè rèrè é ólí émàè? [the man
PRP.DUR CONC eat the food] ‘Did the man even continue to eat the food?’), and (ólí
ómóhé khà sé é ólí émàè [the man PAP.HYP DUR eat the food] ‘The man would have
continued to eat the food’).
     More restricted than any other phasal aspectualizer is ghe. It does not co-occur
with dubitatives or assumptive judgment Concessive rere. ghe combines with ra-
tional judgment za, assumptive kha, and speculative ma: (ólí ómòhè záà ghè é émàè
[the man PRP.DED PCT eat the food] ‘The man must have just eaten the food’), (ólí
ómóhé zá' ghè é ólí émàè [the man PAP.RES PCT eat the food] ‘As a result the man
just ate the food’), (ólí ómóhé má' ghè é ólí émàè [the man PAP.CER PCT eat the food]
‘The man surely just ate the food’), and (ólí ómóhé khà ghé é ólí émàè [the man
PAP.HYP PCT eat the food] ‘The man would have just eaten the food’).
     Phasal aspectualizers limit co-occurrence with relative tense auxiliaries. Forms
gbo, ghe and se tend to fail with Anterior ke or Subsequent kpe. It is only che that
follows each relative tense form. It requires an interrogative structure with Anterior
ke (ólí ómòhè kéè chè é émàè? [the man PRP.ANT REP eat food] ‘Did the man eat food
again anymore?’), but not with kpe (ólí ómóhé kpé' chè é émàè [the man PAP.SUB
REP eat food] ‘The man yet ate food again’).
     As a subclass, phasal forms minimally restrict sentence mood and polarity. che,
gbo, se and ghe appear in imperative constructions: (chè é vbí ólí émàè [REP eat LOC
the food] ‘Eat from the food again’), (gbò é vbí ólí émàè [ADD eat LOC the food] ‘Eat
from the food too’), (sè é ólí émàè [DUR eat the food] ‘Continue eating the food’), and
(ghè é ólí émàè léé [PCT eat the food TEMP] ‘Just eat up all the food / Just finish eat-
ing the food’).
     Neither Additive gbo nor Punctual ghe occur in prohibitives. Both Repetitive che
and Durative se do: (é è chè é vbí ólí émàè [you PR REP eat LOC the food] ‘Don't eat
from the food again’), and (é è sè é ólí émàè [you PR DUR eat the food] ‘Don't con-
tinue eating the food’).
     Each phasal aspectualizer appears in polar questions: (ólí ómóhé ché' é émàè?
[the man PAP.REP eat food] ‘Did the man eat food again?’), (ólí ómòhè chéè é émàè?
[the man PRP.REP eat food] ‘Has the man eaten food again?’), (ólí ómóhé gbó' é vbí
ólí émàè? [the man PAP.ADD eat LOC the food] ‘Did the man eat from the food too?’),
(ólí ómòhè gbóò è vbí ólí émàè? [the man PRP.ADD eat LOC the food] ‘Has the man
eaten from the food too?’), (ólí ómòhè séè é ólí émàè? [the man PRP.DUR eat the
food] ‘Did the man continue eating the food?’), and (ólí ómòhè ò ó ghé è émáé ènyáà?
[the man SC C PCT eat food just.now] ‘Is the man just eating food now?’).
     All but Punctual ghe occur with Perfect Negation: (ólí ómòhè í ì ché è vbí ólí
émàè [the man SC NEG REP eat LOC the food] ‘The man didn’t eat from the food
again’), (ólí ómòhè í ì gbó è ólí émàè [the man SC NEG ADD eat the food [‘The man
didn’t also eat the food’), and (ólí ómòhè í ì sé è ólí émàè [the man SC NEG DUR eat

122 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs3.2.1.2 Boundary ya, mo, òó
Boundary aspectualizers profile the temporal onset or endpoint of an event under
realis or irrealis conditions or single out the endpoint of an event as one phase of a
distal past expanse of time. Among boundary forms, òó, ya and mo express five
distinct functions. òó conveys a Conative function; ya specifies Ingressive and Past
Absolute functions; and mo articulates Egressive and a contrasting Past Absolute
function. For both ya and mo, subject phrase tone distinguishes Past Absolute from
Ingressive/Egressive.
     Conative (CON) òó ‘go to’ brings event onset into perspective and asserts a rela-
tion between subject volition/desire and event occurrence. The speaker remains
noncommittal as to event onset or completion.(56) ólí ómòhè ó ó'      è ólí émàè.
     the man SC CON eat the food
     ‘The man has gone to eat the food.’    The boundary form ya conveys Ingressive and Past Absolute functions. With
right edge low tone subject, ya with inherent low tone expresses an Ingressive (IG)
function. It brings event onset into perspective and asserts failure to achieve onset.
Ingressive ya does not arise with a right edge high tone subject.(57) a. ólí ómòhè yà       é ólí émàè.
        the man PRP.IG eat the food

     ‘Oje almost killed a rat just recently.’    When preceded by a right edge high tone subject, ya exhibits a Past Absolute
(PA) function rendered ‘used to, formerly.’ It profiles the endpoint of an event as a
subphase of an interval of past time, asserting event occurrence in the past and
implying its present nonoccurrence. Right edge low tone subjects do not convey the
Past Absolute function.

     the man    PAP.PA kill the rats TP year
     ‘The man used to kill the rats in the year we discussed.’Past Absolute ya is compatible with nonDAY adverbs bearing a distal relation to the
present such as past generation (e.g. ìghéèghé) or past discourse (élá úkpè). Past
Absolute ya is incompatible with DAY adverbs like òdè ‘yesterday.’(60) a. ójé yà        móé éghó' ìghéèghé.
        Oje PAP.PA have money generations.ago
        ‘Oje used to have money long ago.’

        Oje PAP.PA play drum APP us             TP y ear      yesterday
        ‘Oje used to play the drum for us in the year we talked about.’    Aspectualizer mo functions correlate with a tone contrast in the subject phrase.
With right edge low tone subject, mo manifests an Egressive (EG) function. Showing
a retrospective view of an event, mo profiles an event's temporal endpoint and as-
serts failure to attain endpoint. Verbs lacking an inherent temporal endpoint, such
as e ‘eat,’ become compatible with Egressive mo through co-occurrence with post-
verbal particle lee.(61) ólí ómòhè móò     é ólí émàè léé.
     the man PRP.EG eat the food TEMP
     ‘The man almost completed / finished eating the food.’Inherently bounded verbs like voon ‘be full’ do not require lee. Egressive mo occurs
with the right edge low tone subject of the Present perfect, not the Past perfect.(62) ólì ùbèlè móò        vòòn.
     the gourd PRP.EG be.full
     ‘The gourd is almost full.’Aspectualizer mo conveys Past Absolute (PA) with the right edge high tone subject
of the Past perfect. Translated ‘at a time in the past, formerly,’ it highlights event
endpoint as one subphase from a past expanse of time not extending back to distal
past of previous generations. Past Absolute mo asserts event occurrence during the
past without an implication of present nonoccurrence. Past Absolute mo fails to
arise with the right edge low tone subject of the Present perfect.

     Oje PAP.PA kill rat TP year          long.ago     yesterday
     ‘Oje at one time killed rats during the year we discussed.’     As a subclass, boundary aspectualizers are extremely limited in their co-
occurrence potential. Due to contrasting tonal conditions and meanings, the distinct
functions of ya are incompatible with each other, as are the distinct functions of mo.
It is also not possible to combine ya and mo, regardless of their functions. As for
Conative òó, it precedes Ingressive ya, but only in imperatives, not declaratives.
Conative òó is also ungrammatical with remaining boundary forms, irrespective of
linear order.(65) òó yà é ólí émàè.
     CON IG eat the food
     ‘Go to start eating the food.’    Boundary aspectualizers restrict inflection as well as auxiliary modality and rel-
ative tense. Conative òó appears in Present perfect and prospective Anticipative but
not Past perfect, prospective Predictive or imperfect aspect.(66) a. ólí ómòhè ó ó'       è ólí émàè.

ré' ó è émàè [the man PAP.CONC CON eat food] ‘The man even went to eat food’).
     Conative òó follows relative tense, with Anterior ke requiring an interrogative
construction: (ólí ómòhè kéè ó è ólí émàè? [the man PRP.ANT CON eat the food] ‘Did
the man go to eat the food afterward?’), and (ólí ómóhé kpé' ó è ólí émàè [the man
PAP.SUB CON eat the food] ‘Despite knowing pending conditions, the man still went
to eat the food’).
     Ingressive ya limits inflection and auxiliary expression.4 It shows Present per-
fect only, rejecting imperfect and prospective. Ingressive ya restricts modality. It
fails with deontic Hortative í or any epistemic form. Likewise, Ingressive ya fails
with relative tense forms ke and kpe.
     Past Absolute ya severely restricts auxiliaries. It requires Past perfect but rejects
Present perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect. Relative to modality, Past Abso-
lute ya is also highly restricted. It fails with deontic Hortative and all epistemic
forms. As well, its fails with relative tense ke or kpe.
     The distribution of Egressive mo is somewhat less retricted than other boundary
forms. It requires Present perfect. But it fails in Past perfect, imperfect and prospec-
tive. Regarding modality, Egressive mo fails with deontic Hortative í and all epistem-
ic forms except Deductive za.(67) ólí ómòhè záà      mò é ólí émàè léé.
     the man PRP.DED EG eat the food TEMP
     ‘The man must have almost finished eating the food.’Egressive mo follows only Anterior ke from relative tense.(68) ólí ómóhé ké'        mò é ólí émàè léé.
     the man PAP.ANT EG eat the food TEMP
     ‘The man almost finished eating the food afterward.’     The Past Absolute function of mo severely restricts auxiliaries. It requires Past
perfect but disallows Present perfect, imperfect or prospective. Past Absolute mo
fails with deontic Hortative, all epistemic forms as well as both relative tense forms.
     Boundary aspectualizers severely limit sentence mood and polarity. Only Cona-
tive òó and Ingressive ya allow imperatives, with verbs like je ‘laugh’ requiring ya.
126 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsNeither Egressive mo, Past Absolute ya nor Past Absolute mo occur in imperatives.
No boundary forms appear in prohibitives.(69) a. òó è ólí émàè.

        ‘Go to eat the food.’
     b. yà é ólí émàè.
        IG eat the food
        ‘Start eating the food.’Relative to polar interrogatives, boundary preverbs reveal a distinct pattern. Cona-
tive òó and either Past Absolute ya or mo appear in polar questions. Ingressive ya
and Egressive mo do not. No boundary aspectualizers occur in negative statements.(70) a. ólí ómòhè ó ó' è ólí émàè?

        ‘Did the man at one time kill rats during the year we discussed.’3.2.1.3 Co-occurrence of phasal and boundary forms
Linear order and sentence mood constrain co-occurrence of phasal and boundary
aspectualizers. In declaratives, Conative follows each phasal preverb che, gbo, se
and ghe: (ólí ómòhè chéè ó è émàè [the man PRP.REP CON eat food] ‘The man again
went to eat food’), (ólí ómòhè gbóò ó è émàè [the man PRP.ADD CON eat food] ‘The
man also went to eat food’), (ólí ómòhè séè ó è ólí émàè [the man PRP.DUR CON eat
the food] ‘The man continued to go to eat the food’), and (ólí ómóhé ghé' ó è ólí
émàè [the man PAP.PCT CON eat the food] ‘The man just went to eat the food’).
     More restricted in distribution is Egressive mo. It follows Punctual ghe but no
other phasal preverb: (ólí ómóhé ghé' mò é ólí émàè léé [the man PAP.PCT EG eat the
food TEMP] ‘The man just almost finished eating the food’).
     Ingressive ya is unacceptable with phasal ghe and se. It precedes rather than
follows phasal che and gbo: (ólí ómòhè yà ché é vbí ólí émàè [the man PRP.IG REP eat
LOC the food] ‘The man almost ate from the food again’), and (ólí ómòhè yà gbò é vbí
ólí émàè [the man PRP.IG ADD eat LOC the food] ‘The man almost ate from the food
too’).
                                                             Preverb categories | 127     More limited is Past Absolute ya, which precedes only se among phasal forms.
And Past Absolute mo fails with all phasal preverbs: (ólí ómóhé yà sé gbé ófé élá
úkpè [the man PAP.PA DUR kill rat TP year] ‘The man used to still kill rats during the
year we discussed’).
     Phasal and boundary forms combine differently in imperatives. Conative pre-
cedes or follows Durative se. It does not co-occur with other phasal forms in impera-
tives, regardless of linear order: (sè ó è émàè [DUR CON eat food] ‘Continue going to
eat food’), and (òó sè é émàè [CON DUR eat food] ‘Go to eat food meanwhile’).
     In imperatives, Ingressive ya does not occur with Repetitive che or Additive gbo.
However, it precedes Durative se and Punctual ghe: (yà sé é ólí émàè [IG DUR eat the
food] ‘Start eating the food meanwhile’), and (yà ghé é ólí émàè [IG PCT eat the food]
‘Just start eating the food’).
     Still more complex combinations of phasal and boundary aspectualizers occur.
A sampling reveals the potential for Ingressive ya to follow Conative òó and phasal
forms che, gbo, se and ghe, and for phasal se in these same structures to follow
Punctual ghe: (ólí ómòhè í yà ghé sè tón ókà é [the man HOR IG PCT DUR harvest
maize eat] ‘The man should just continue to start harvesting maize and eating it’),
(ólí ómòhè séè ó yà híán óràn [the man PRP.DUR CON IG cut wood] ‘The man contin-
ued to go to start cutting wood’), and (ólí ómòhè ghéè ó yà híán óràn [the man
PRP.PCT CON IG cut wood] ‘The man just went to start cutting wood’).","[143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153]"

  As well, human nouns that express generic reference such as óìà/éèà ‘human being, person’ fail to
take a li complement: *óíá lì kéré [person R younger] ‘younger human being,’ *ééá lì kéré [persons R

  Additional human propensity adjectives are: ómóhé lì bùmèbúmé [man R haggard.and.worn out]
‘haggard man,’ óvbékhán lì tùzètúzé [youth R underweight.and.dirty] ‘an unkempt youth,’ and
ómóhé lì sènèséné [man R repulsive / very.ugly] ‘an ugly man.’Not all human propensity adjectives appear as attributive phrases; the form húré ‘pompous’ requires
a relative clause.ómóhé lí ó ò ù húré                             *ómóhé lì húré

  Never serving as li complement is the abstract noun àtà ‘truth’: *émí lì àtà [thing R true] ‘true
thing,’ *ókhá lì àtà [story R true] ‘true story.’23
   Age attributives fail with common noun heads that are human. Instead, analytic compounds
consisting of a human noun followed by an age noun refer to adult (not nonadult) standing in socie-
ty rather than age relative to the immediate moment.*ómóhé lí ódíòn                                   ómóhódíòn

 ‘senior child’                                   ‘senior child’24
  With either count or mass noun head, Relator li is optional. Nonetheless under this free variation
condition, meaning of the phrase and tone on the head noun (spread of high tone) are identical:
ímóhé (lì) ògbèré [men R plentiful] ‘a lot of men,’ ékén (lì) ògbèré [sand R plentiful] ‘a lot of sand.’25
  Collective and distributive numeral complements follow third person plural pronouns: íyáín lì èvá
[they R two] ‘both of them / group of two,’ and ìyàìn èvá [they two] ‘two of them.’26
  As a final comment, instances where phrases with collective and attribution interpretations might
be expected to co-occur, each marked by Relator li with a place or human noun in head position, fail
to do so: *íwé lì èvá lì kéré [house R two R small.size] ‘group of two small-sized houses’; *íwé lì kéré lì
èvá [house R small.size R two] ‘group of two small-sized houses’;*ímóhé lì èélè lì kéré [men R four R
small.size] ‘group of four small-sized men’; *ímóhé lì kéré lì èélè [men R small.size R four] ‘group of
four small-sized men.’27
     Pronominally headed relative clauses show a plural shape with élí in head position.(i) élí é      nwú'      émà lí    ònwìmè, é       fí'       áwá údò.
    ones they PAP.take yam APP farmer they PRP.hit dog stone
    ‘As for the ones who gave yam to the farmer, they hit a dog with a stone.’28
  Pronominally headed relative clauses also occur in Emai. They fail to show Relator li, and they are
headed by a relative pronoun denoting either an animate (ólí), inanimate (émé') or place (ébé')
236 | Noun modifiersreferent (Chapter 5, 5.8). Relative pronouns uniformly show high tone or high tone followed by high
downstep.(i) a. ólí ólí ómóhé záwó'

       ‘the one who the man saw’
    b. émé' ólí ókpósó dé'-ì

       ‘what the woman bought’
    c. ébé' ólí ókpósó ó'-ì

       ‘where the woman entered’29
  Deictic time nominals (òdè, ákhò and éènà) serving as temporal adjuncts (òdè in ólí ómóhé fí ólí
áwá údó òdè ‘The man hit the dog with a stone yesterday’) never relativize.(i) *ódé        lí ólí ómóhé fí'     ólí áwá údó gbó'           tèè.
     yesterday R the man PAP.hit the dog stone PAP.ADD be.long
     ‘Yesterday when the man hit the dog with a stone was also long.’30
  As a further note, ambiguity as to phrase head can occur in constructions with genitive phrase
and relative clause. In (i) relative clause head preceding Relator li could be possessum úríáí or pos-
sessor óvbéé; either could serve as direct object of shen ‘sell’ and thus as head of the relative clause.(i) úríáí ísì óvbéé lí ójé shén-ì
    tail ASS monkey R Oje sell-F
    ‘tail of the monkey that Oje sold’
5 Pronouns and conjunction
Emai pronouns express relations relative to linguistic or situational context. They
reflect five basic types: personal, bound (anaphoric), interrogative, locative and
impersonal. Exponents of these types can reflect case, person, number, gender,
and/or definiteness. In characterizing Emai grammatical structure, both overt pro-
noun and zero (gapped) pronoun prove useful.
     Zero pronoun is illustrated by the syntactic position following the transitive
verb nwu ‘take.’ This verb is subcategorized for a direct object. nwu takes a pronoun
(e.g. óì ‘it’) in the absence of a lexical noun. In series with another verb (e.g. hian
‘cut’), as well as in other structural patterns, nwu also takes a zero pronoun.(1) a. ólí ókpósó ló     nwú óì ní émè.
       the woman PRED take it APP me
       ‘The woman will give it to me.’
    b. ólí ókpósó ló     hìàn éànmì nwú ní émè.
       the woman PRED cut meat take APP me
       ‘The woman will cut meat in order to give it to me.’5.1 Definite personal pronouns
Definite personal pronouns reflect person (first, second or third), number (singular
and plural), case (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) and discourse status
(emphatic).

    ‘It was they who gave it to me in your house.’Restrained by case, number and person, personal pronouns refer to participants in
the situational or linguistic context. Third person subject forms (ó ‘she’) can co-refer
to a noun phrase in a preceding sentence.(3) ólì òkpòsò míé     òhí. ó ó             vbì ìwè.
    the woman PRP.see Ohi she PAP.enter LOC house
    ‘The woman1 saw Ohi. She1 entered the house.’In complex sentences containing two or more clauses, nominative pronouns (ó)
express co-reference to a lexical antecedent (áléké) in a preceding clause. They tend
not to co-refer to a noun phrase in a following clause. This condition obtains regard-
less of whether the pronoun occurs in the main or subordinate clause of a complex
sentence.(4) a. bí áléké ré'         míé òhí, ó ó'            vbì ìwè.

        she PAP.enter LOC house as Aleke PAP.CONC see Ohi
        ‘Shei entered the house, when Alekei saw Ohi.’     For third person plural subject, e and yan exponents occur in complementary
distribution. Plural e tends not to co-refer to a noun phrase across a sentence
boundary; instead, it co-refers within a clause. In contrast, plural yan co-refers to a
noun phrase within or across sentences.(5) a. élí ívbèkhàn yé             ògò. yán gbé'        ófè.

        the youths    PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat
       ‘The youths went to the bush. They killed rats.’In addition, distribution of third person plural subject forms yan and e is controlled
by matrix clause aspect and structural position. Plural e is restricted to perfect as-
pect. It never occurs in clauses inflected for imperfect, as yan does. Plural third per-
son e is limited to subject position relative to an antecedent in the same clause or
sentence; yan is not. When a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus,
antitopic (right dislocated), question or relative clause position and the matrix
clause inflects for perfect aspect, e or yan appears as subject.(6) a. élí ívbèkhàn, é / yán gbé'             ólí ófè.

240 | Pronouns and conjunctionWhen a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus, antitopic (right dis-
located), question or relative clause position and the matrix clause is inflected for
imperfect aspect, yan occupies subject position. e never does, as topic and focus
li/ni constructions suggest.(7) a. ívbèkhàn, yán à / *é è gbè ófè.
       youths       they H      they H kill rat
       ‘As for youths, they kill rats.’
    b. ívbèkhàn lí yán à / *é è gbè ófè.
       youths      PF they H       they H kill rat
       ‘It is youths who kill rats.’When the third person plural emphatic pronoun appears in focus or topic position
linked to a matrix clause inflected for perfect aspect, subject position accepts only
yan, not e.(8) a. ìyàìn lí yán / *é       gbé'      ólí ófè.
       they PF they they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘It was they who killed the rat.’

       they they they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘As for them, they killed the rat.’Within S-complements (marked by Indicative khi for example, Chapter 13, 13.2.1),
subject position under perfect aspect accepts yan or e, with yan showing ambiguity
between personal (disjoint reference vis-à-vis subject élí ímóhé) and logophoric
(conjoint reference vis-à-vis élí ímóhé) interpretations. In contrast, e offers only a
disjoint interpretation.(9) élí ímóhé ré'         é khì yàn / è           gbé      ólí ófè.
    the men PAP.CONC say IND they            they PRP.kill the rat
    ‘The men said that they killed the rat.’     Of the personal pronouns, only emphatic forms appear with postdeterminer
modifiers. Emphatic pronouns for each person occur with emphatic partitive òkpá
‘alone.’ No emphatic pronoun, however, co-occurs with the definite predeterminer
(*élì ìyàìn ‘the they’).mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn            / màmàì / vbàvbà / ìyàìn òkpá

person plural allow postdeterminers from quantity, demonstrative and attributive
classes. The third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts the greatest range of
modifiers. It is found with cardinal or collective numeral modifiers but not distribu-
tive or ordinal numeral modifiers.ìyàìn èvá ‘two of them’                 íyáín lì èvá ‘both of them, both’
they two                                they R two

 they two.each (distributive)            they R secondThe third person plural emphatic pronoun combines with univeral quantifiers (col-
lective èrèmé, distributive òdóòdé) but not existential quantifiers (partitive ésò,
contrastive évbèé).íyáín èrèmé ‘all of them’                íyáín òdóòdé ‘each of them’
they all                                 they each
*íyáín ésò ‘some of them’               *íyáín évbèé ‘others of them’
 they certain                            they otherAnd the third person plural emphatic pronoun allows demonstrative proximal nà
but not distal áìn or contrastive nóì.íyáín nà ‘this very they’               *íyáín nóì ‘the next very they’
they this                                they next
*íyáín áìn ‘that very they
 they thatThe third person plural emphatic never accepts kindred modifiers, neither deictic
élìyó (*íyáín élìyó [they that.kind] ‘they of that kind’) nor contrastive édàn (*íyáín
édàn [they different.kind] ‘they of a different kind’).
     Relative to postnominal modifier types designated by a grammatical morpheme,
the third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts Relator li attributive phrases but
not relative clauses (*íyáín lí ójé shén' lí ókpósó [they R Oje PAP.sell APP woman]
‘they that Oje sold to the woman’) or Associative ísì phrases (*íyáín ísì òjè [they ASS
Oje]‘those of Oje’).íyáín lí óbín' ‘they that dark’
they R dark
242 | Pronouns and conjunctionThe third person singular emphatic pronoun is more restricted than its plural coun-
terpart. As shown earlier, the singular form combines only with emphatic partitive
òkpá ‘alone.’ The singular emphatic fails to combine with numeral òkpá ‘one.’ìyòìn òkpá ‘he alone’                    *ìyòìn òkpá ‘one he’
he alone                                  he    oneAlso quite limited are first and second person plural emphatic pronouns. They only
combine with universal quantifiers: collective èrèmé and distributive òdóòdé.vbávbá èrèmé ‘all of you, you all’       vbávbá òdóòdé ‘each of you’
you    all                               you    each

we    all                                we     each5.2 Expletive and indefinite pronouns
Emai subject position shows both an expletive and an indefinite pronoun. Expletive
o occurs in relation to an extraposed complement clause. Although an embedded S-
complement can serve as logical subject, it is obligatorily extraposed to clause final
position. Its grammatical subject position is held by expletive pronoun o.(10) a. ò hùnmé                 khì òjè gbé        ólí ényè.
        it PRP.be.fortuitous IND Oje PRP.kill the snake
        ‘It is fortuitous that Oje killed the snake.’
     b. *khì òjè gbé         ólí ényè húnmé.
         IND Oje PRP.kill the snake PRP.be.fortuitous
         ‘That Oje killed the snake is fortuitous.’   Subject position also shows indefinite pronoun a ‘one.’ If not translated by the
English passive, it is rendered with indefinite plural ‘they’ or ‘one’ in active voice.(11) á    gbé'      ólí ófè.
     one PAP.kill the rat
     ‘One / They killed the rat / The rat was killed.’Indefinite a never occupies nonsubject grammatical positions such as direct or indi-
rect object, or discourse-defined positions like focus or topic.1

         Oje PRP.take yam APP one
         ‘Oje gave yam to one.’

         one PF he PAP.kill the rat
         ‘It was one that killed the rat.’Indefinite a is limited to subject positions subcategorized for human noun agentives
or experiencers, as grammatical gbe above illustrates. It is not licensed by stative
verbs (ri, da) or motion verbs (o, ye), which otherwise allow a human noun subject.(13) a. *à ríì          vbì ìwè.
         one PRP.be LOC house
        ‘One is in the house.’
     b. *à dá-ì.

     d. *à yé                 ìwè.
         one PRP.move.to house
         ‘One moved toward the house.’Indefinite subject a occurs with transitive verbs requiring experiencer subjects.
However, it does so only in negative constructions.(14) a. á    ì     èén khí ólì òkpòsò sá            ólí ómòhè.
         one NEG know IND the woman PRP.shoot the man

         one PRP.know-F IND the woman PRP.shoot the man
         ‘One knew that the woman shot the man.’Indefinite a never co-refers across sentences, across clause boundaries within a
complex sentence or across clauses embedded within one another.

         ‘The youthsi knew that theyi killed the rat.’    Two nominal forms that in some constructions exhibit a placeholder function in
lieu of pronouns are émì ‘thing’ and óìà ‘person, human being.’ émì refers to non-
human entities. It occurs as second object in a double object complement when a
specific referent is required but not named (e.g. émì ‘something’ ~ úkpóràn ‘stick’),
as also happens in subject and direct object positions. Nonetheless, émì never oc-
curs as indirect object following Applicative li/ni or as first object in a double object
construction, both of which require human nouns.(16) a. ólì òkpòsò fí        ólí óvbékhán émì / úkpóràn.

         the woman PRP.hit thing stick

ers, some of which express definiteness and specificity of a referent. It fails especial-
ly with the universal quantifier òdóòdé, which only combines with human nouns.ólí émì ‘the thing’                      émí nóì         ‘the next thing’

Genitive or possessor pronouns follow Associative ísì but they also appear in associ-
ative phrases without ísì. Omission of ísì is controlled by possessor number and
person. First and third person pronouns act uniformly while second person reveals a
split distribution, singular èé ‘you’ behaving like third person, and plural àvbá ‘you’
like first person. Under ísì omission, the possessor pronoun assumes direct object
rather than genitive form.
     Alienable possession phrases with pronoun possessors display two patterns
concerning ísì omission. With first person and second person plural and first person
singular, ísì is optional.ópíá    ísì èmé / àmáí / àvbá           ópíá mè / màì / vbà
cutlass ASS my our        your          cutlass my our your
‘my / our / your cutlass’               ‘my / our / your cutlass’With third person singular and plural as well as second person singular in alienable
relations, ísì is obligatory.ópíá     ísì òí / èé / ìyáín            *ópíá     óì / é / íyàìn
cutlass ASS his your their               cutlass his your their
‘his / your / their cutlass’             ‘his / your / their cutlass’

tern. When the possessor exponent is first person singular or plural, or second per-
son plural, ísì is optional.áwé ísì èmé / àmáí / àvbá              áwé mè / màì / vbá

‘my leg’                               ‘my leg’    For inalienable relations, when possessor is third person singular, second per-
son singular or third person plural, ísì is obligatory.óé ísì òí / èé                         *óé óì / é
leg ASS his your                        leg his your

legs ASS their                          legs their
‘their legs’                            ‘their legs’    The syntactic realization of inalienable possession within a sentence, and hence
the syntactic realization of genitive pronouns, is controlled by referential identity
between possessor and grammatical subject, verb type (physical event vs cognitive
event) and alienability relation.
    Within its clause, grammatical subject constrains appearance of pronoun pos-
sessor, although only for inalienable relations. Where referential identity exists
between inalienable possessor and grammatical subject, i.e. conjoint reference, the
possessor constituent (òí) and its ísì governor are disallowed.(18) ólí ómòhè gbáló     óbò / *óbó ísì òí.
     the man PRP.wrap hand hand ASS his
     ‘The mani wrapped hisi hand / wrapped his own hand.’Where non-identity, i.e. disjoint reference, obtains between subject and possessor,
an ísì phrase with a genitive pronoun complement is obligatory.(19) ólí ómòhè gbáló        óbó ísì òí.
     the man     PRP.wrap hand ASS his
     ‘The mani wrapped hisj hand.’
248 | Pronouns and conjunctionPhrases where possessor precedes possessa (external possession, Chapter 4,
4.3.3.1.1) never allow an identity relation between possessor and grammatical sub-
ject. Non-identity is required.(20) ólí ómòhè gbáló      óí óbò.
     the man PRP.wrap his hand
     ‘The mani wrapped hisj hand.’     Conditions governing possessor expression with inalienable possessa apply to
direct object and locative goal positions. Conjoint reference leads to absence of both
ísì and possessor pronoun, while disjoint reference conditions presence of ísì and its
possessor pronoun (òí).(21) a. ólí ómòhè híán        àwè.
        the man PRP.cut legs
        ‘The mani cut hisi legs.’
     b. ólí ómòhè híán        àwè ísì òì.

     d. ólì òkpòsò kú           ìbàtà ó vbí áwé ísì òí.
        the woman PRP.cast shoes CL LOC feet ASS her
        ‘The womani put shoes on herj feet.’    Alienable possessa are not similarly constrained. Whether conjoint or disjoint
reference obtains between grammatical subject and possessor, possessor and ísì are
obligatory. Absence of ísì and its complement encode a nonpossession relation.(22) a. ólì òkpòsò gbé         ákhé ísì òì á.
        the woman PRP.break pot ASS her CS

        the woman PRP.break pot CS
        ‘The womani broke a / *heri pot.’Inalienable possession noun phrases, regardless of conjoint or disjoint reference
between possessor and grammatical subject, are disallowed in indirect object posi-
tion marked by li/ni.

Emai shows three bound pronouns co-referring to a preceding noun phrase. Reflex-
ive and Reciprocal must have their antecedent in the same clause. Logophoric pro-
noun antecedents cannot be in the same clause.
    Logophoric (LOG) pronouns are employed in narrative discourse to track gram-
matical subject of a communication or cognition verb (Chapter 13, 13.3.3). Limited to
third person, logophoric pronouns reflect case (subject/non-subject grammatical
relations) and number (singular/plural). Their form does not distinguish between
nonsubject position and positions defined by discourse status (i.e. focus or topic).","[260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275]"
"7.5.2.1 Place ébé' / ébí'
The interrogative pronoun ébé'/ébí' in question word position articulates direct and
indirect questions of Place. In canonical declaratives, ébé'/ébí' never occurs as a

Interrogative pronoun ébé'/ébí' (likely shortened from élàbé/élàbí) and Manner
preverb i/e in the matrix clause express Manner ‘how.’ Direct and indirect questions

Alternative forms articulate direct and indirect questions of Person. An interrogative
pronoun with the number shapes singular óe'/ói' and plural éé'/éí' frame Person
direct questions. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular o, plural e) occurs in matrix
subject position. For indirect object position marked by Applicative li/ni, a zero
pronoun corresponds to the interrogative pronoun for person.(80) a. óé' ó híán'      ólí óràn?

       whom the man PAP.take yam APP
       ‘Whom did the man give yam to?’Indirect questions of Person rely on the relative pronoun ólì/élì with its singu-
lar/plural forms. Question position in indirect interrogatives never accepts pronoun
óé'/óí' ~ éé' /éí'. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular ó, plural é) occupies subject
position. When the question word corresponds to indirect object marked by Applica-
tive li/ni, the matrix clause exhibits a zero pronoun.(81) a. ì één         ólí / *óé' ó híán'     ólí óràn.

Direct and indirect questions of Possessor are framed by Person interrogative pro-
nouns and relative pronouns. However, question shape varies according to direct or
indirect status. Direct questions utilize interrogative pronoun óé'/óí'~éé'/éí' as com-
plement of an Associative ísì phrase, the entire phrase being in question position.(83) a. éwé ísì óé' ólí ómóhé nwú'           lí  ònwìmè?
        goat ASS who the man PAP.take APP farmer
        ‘Whose goat did the man give to the farmer?’

        goat ASS who the man PAP.take APP farmer
        ‘Whose goat did the man give to the farmer?’Indirect questions of Possessor assume either of two shapes. When the question
position constituent corresponds to a matrix relation other than subject, the relative
pronoun ólì appears in question position and a personal pronoun (òí) occupies the
corresponding matrix clause position.17(84) a. ì één         ólí ójé nwú'        éwé ísì òí lí      ònwìmè.

          I PRP.know goat ASS one Oje PAP.take APP farmer
          ‘I knew whose goat Oje gave to the farmer.’When the question constituent in an indirect question with Possessor corefers to
matrix clause subject, an entire Associative ísì phrase (éwé ísì ólí) occurs in embed-
ded clause initial position. The relative pronoun ólí serves as Possessor. Subject in
the matrix clause then requires a personal pronoun (e.g. ó).(85) a. ì één       éwé ísì ólí ó ó'           vbì ìwè.

Direct and indirect questions of Time show éghè ‘time’ in question position and verb
re ‘take’ in series in the matrix clause. Direct questions show an optional positive
focus particle after éghè.(87) a. éghè ólí ómóhé ré'        híán ólí óràn?

The interrogative pronoun émé'/émí' frames direct and indirect Object questions.
Direct questions show émé'/émí' in question position. Indirect questions also show
émé'/émí' in clause initial position under the verb een, as head of an unmarked
relative clause.19(90) a. émé' ólí ómóhé ré'        híán ólí óràn?

Conditional Purpose interrogatives require question word émé'/émí' and clause final
Subjunctive form ni. Direct questions show the contrasting positions of émé'/émí'
and ni. Conditional purpose occurs in direct questions, never indirect questions.(95) a. émé' ólí ómóhé dúá'        ábò lí      òjè ní?

Question word émé'/émí' and a bare noun frame Kindred interrogatives. They are
limited to direct questions, never appearing as indirect questions.(97) a. úróó      émé' ú à zé?

        ‘What kind of question did the man ask Ohi to consider?’While Kindred émé'/émí' appears in no indirect question, a relative clause headed

        ‘I knew the question that the man asked Ohi to consider.’As responses to kindred direct questions, one finds semantically relevant nouns in

The question word ékà ‘quantity’ articulates direct and indirect questions of Quanti-
ty. Direct questions illustrate the position and function of ékà. When ékà corre-
sponds to matrix subject, a subject pronoun is obligatory.(101) ékà      ó rì      vbí ááìn?
      quantity it PAP.be LOC there
      ‘How many are at that place?’Indirect questions of Quantity require Relator li/ni coding a relative clause after ékà.(102) ì één       éká     lí /*éká        ó rì vbí ááìn.
      I PRP.know quantity R quantity it PAP.be LOC there
      ‘I knew how many were at that place.’As responses, direct questions of Quantity with ékà accept quantity pronouns. ékà
questions accept pronouns for cardinal numerals (e.g. èvá), collective numerals (e.g.
èvèvá), collective universal quantifier (èrèmé) or partitive existential quantifier
(ésò). These forms occur in situ or in simple syntactic phrases but not in Specifier
copula óò constructions. Among existential quantity forms, it is only contrastive
existential quantifier évbèé that is unacceptable.(103) ékà      ó rì      vbí ááìn?

      ‘It is two / both / all / some / other ones.’7.5.2.12 Partitive quantity Noun ékà
Quantity questions with partitive sense take either of two patterns with ékà and a
noun.22 Either ékà appears after a bare count noun in question position or ékà ap-
pears in question position and, in the matrix clause, a count noun modified by defi-
nite article élí remains in a vbi marked partitive phrase.23(104) a. érán ékà       ólí ómóhé bén-nó'-ì?

         quantity the man PAP.able cut-DS LOC the trees
         ‘How many of the trees was the man able to cut?’Direct questions of Partitive Quantity are structured differently from indirect ques-
tions only with respect to the latter’s obligatory inclusion of relative clause marker li
after ékà.(105) a. émá ékà      ójé húá'      lí   ònwìmè?

         I PRP.know yam quantity R Oje PAP.take APP farmer
         ‘I knew how many yams Oje gave to the farmer.’Indirect partitive questions also show ékà after a bare noun or alone in question
position with the noun, now modified, in a partitive vbi complement.(106) a. ì één       érán éká       lí ójé bén-nó'-ì.

         ‘I knew how many of the trees Oje was able to cut.’
394 | Noncanonical constructionsAs responses, direct questions of Partitive Quantity take a range of quantity expres-
sions. With ékà and a bare noun in question position, direct questions accept quan-
tity pronouns, including cardinal numerals (e.g. èvá), the collective numerals (e.g.
èvèvá), collective universal quantifier èrèmé, and partitive existential quantifier ésò.
These occur in focus position. Unacceptable among quantity pronouns is the con-
trastive existential quantifier évbèé.(107) érán ékà        ólí ómóhé bén-nó'-ì?

The interrogative form ékà frames lexical and phrasal questions of Cost. Lexical cost
questions relate to subject and direct object positions. ékà Cost questions occur
when the matrix clause shows a verb whose direct object is subcategorized for cost,
e.g. hae ‘pay.’ Direct questions of Cost with these verbs show ékà in question posi-
tion, while indirect questions show ékà as head of a li/ni marked relative clause.(115) a. ékà      ólí ómóhé háé'-ì?
         quantity the man PAP.pay-F
         ‘How much did the man pay?’

         I PRP.know quantity R the man PAP.pay-F
         ‘I knew how much the man paid.’As well, ékà questions occur when Cost corresponds to subject. Direct questions of
Cost appear in Equational Identity í khi constructions, where ékà in question posi-
tion corresponds to Identity subject pronoun í. There is no corresponding indirect
question of Cost formed with Equational Identity.

correspond to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause.
    Matrix clauses across direct and indirect questions limit aspect. They inflect for
Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective, each of which exhibits a
right edge high tone subject phrase. Question constructions reject Present perfect,
Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective, each of which manifests a right

tions. Question position form as well as syntactic shape of elicited answers reveals
fourteen question category types. Responses tend toward noncanonical focus posi-
tion constituents rather than constituents in situ.","[403, 404, 405, 406, 407]"
"13.4.2.1 Ditransitive miaa
The verb miaa ‘ask’ appears as a ditransitive shape in two predication types. One is
a double object predication. Its first object plays an addressee role relative to a con-
ditional S-complement as second object. In double object predications, miaa is the
sole matrix clause verb.(76) ólí ómòhè ò ó mìàà òhí sí          ólì òkpòsò gbé        ólí ófè.
     the man SC C ask Ohi COND the woman PRP.kill the rat
     ‘The man is asking Ohi whether the woman killed the rat.’In a second predication type, matrix verb miaa occurs in series with fee ghoo. Both
verbs and the first object precede a conditional si complement. Neither miaa predi-
cation admits indicative, subjunctive, indirect question, direct quote or VP comple-
ments.(77) òjè ò ó mìàà òhí fèè ghóó sì             àlèkè yé            ímè.
     Oje SC C ask Ohi try.inspect COND Aleke PRP.move.to farm
     ‘Oje is asking Ohi to consider whether Aleke went to the farm.’    Constructions with si complements framed by miaa or miaa fee ghoo constrain
cross-clause subject relations and si complement correspondence to pronominals.
With only miaa as matrix verb, complement subject identity is not restrained, since
personal pronoun (o) or logophoric pronoun (yon) occurs as si complement subject.(78) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó mìàà òhí sì         ò gbé          ólí ófè.

        the man SC C ask Ohi COND LOG PRP.kill the rat
        ‘The mani is asking Ohi whether hei killed the rat.’With miaa and fee ghoo in series in the matrix clause, complement subject identity
is restricted, taking a personal but not a logophoric pronoun.(79) òjè ò ó mìàà òhí fèè ghóó sì             ò / *yòn yé    ìwè.
     Oje SC C ask Ohi try.inspect COND he LOG PRP.move.to house
     ‘Oje is asking Ohii to consider whether hei went home.’
826 | Embedded S- and VP-complementsConstructions framed by miaa and a si complement correspond to an interrogative
étá émé'/ émí' ‘what kind’ question. Responses require matrix verb e, not miaa.
Predications with miaa fee ghoo and a si complement reject corresponding interrog-
ative questions.(80) étá      émé' ólí ómóhé ó ò mìàà òhí (*fèè ghóó)?

The verb ta ‘speak, say’ occurs in transitive and ditransitive predications with S-
complements. Ditransitive ta precedes an Applicative li/ni marked noun phrase, an
S-complement and the verb hon in series. Under these conditions, ta accepts indica-
tive khi. English translation employs ‘say… for NP to hear’ or ‘tell NP.’ For ta li hon-
constructions, verb hon and Applicative addressee are obligatory.(84) ójé tá'       lí    òhí hón khí ólì òkpòsò gbé           ólí ófè.
     Oje PAP.say APP Ohi hear IND the woman PRP.kill the rat
     ‘Oje told Ohi / said for Ohi to hear that the woman killed the rat.’Ditransitive ta also accepts indirect question complements, but only when Applica-
tive li/ni and hon occur clause finally. Constructions framed by ta li hon reject sub-
junctive, conditional, direct quote and VP-complements.

clause subject identity and direct object realization by substitutive pronouns. Sub-
ject identity across matrix and S-complement is optional, since either logophoric
(yon) or personal (iyain) pronoun is acceptable.(86) a. ójé tá'        lí  ólí ókpósó hón khì yòn gbé     ólí ófè.

Transitive verb ta ‘speak, say’ with Factative -i occurs under bare predicate condi-
tions, i.e. no auxiliary, preverb or postverbal. It then takes indicative or subjunctive
complements. Predicate meaning is English ‘say’ or ‘intend’ depending on khi or li.
ta rejects conditional, indirect question, direct quote and VP-complements.(90) a. ólí ómóhé tá-í'        khí ólì òkpòsò gbé         ólí ófè.

        ‘The man intended that the woman kill the rat.’    Constructions with transitive ta and S-complements constrain cross-clause sub-
ject identity and complement correspondence to pronominals. Subject identity
across matrix and embedded clause is not obligatory, since either a logophoric (yon)
or personal (o) pronoun appears in the complement.(91) a. ólí ómóhé tá-í'         khì ò gbé         ólí ófè.

As a complex predicate, transitive ta and verb re ‘arrive’ express the sense ‘report.’
They occur with a limited range of S-complements. They take indicatives and indi-
rect questions but reject subjunctive, conditional, direct quote and VP comple-
ments.(96) a. ójé tá'        ré'    khí ólí òkpòsò gbé      ólí ófè.
        Oje PAP.say arrive IND the woman PRP.kill the rat
        ‘Oje reported that the woman killed the rat.’
     b. ójé tá'        ré'    ébé' ólí ókpósó í'        gbé ólí ófè.
        Oje PAP.say arrive how the woman PAP.MAN kill the rat
        ‘Oje reported how the woman killed the rat.’Constructions framed by ta re and S-complements minimally constrain cross clause
subject identity and direct object correspondence to pro-forms. Subject identity
across matrix and embedded clause is optional, since S-complement subject posi-
tion takes either a logophoric (yon) or personal (o) pronoun.(97) a. ólí ómóhé tá'        ré'    khì yòn gbé       ólí ófè.
        the man PAP.say arrive IND LOG PRP.kill the rat
        ‘The mani reported that hei killed the rat.’
     b. ólí ómóhé tá'        ré'    khì ò gbé        ólí ófè.
        the man PAP.say arrive IND she PRP.kill the rat
        ‘The man reported that she killed the rat.’S-complements of ta re never correspond to an interrogative pronoun in information
questions (e.g. émé' ‘what) or to pro-form ìyó.(98) a. *émé' ólí ómóhé tá'         ré'?
         what the man PAP.say arrive
         ‘What did the man report?’
     b. *ólí ómóhé tá'        ré'     ìyó / tá' ìyó ré.
         the man PAP.say arrive DMD say DMD arrive
         ‘The man reported so.’    Constructions framed by ta re limit inflection, polarity and mood. Relative to
aspect, they inflect for Past and Present perfect but not either imperfect. Concerning
polarity and mood, ta re predications fail as imperatives, prohibitives, negative
statements and polar questions.

        the man PAP.say arrive IND the woman PRP.kill the rat
        ‘The man has reported that the woman killed the rat.’13.4.3 Communicative verbs and complement typesCommunicative verbs include gue ‘reveal’ and anma ‘agree.’ Only gue as a ditransi-
tive appears in a complex predicate. Communicative verbs take S-complements
marked by khi, li or IQ. They reject S-complements marked by si as well as by DQ.
Predications with these verbs limit aspect to the perfect and differentially restrict
polarity and mood, with ditransitive gue being less constrained. Complement types
with communicative verbs are embedded as direct objects. Complements never
correspond to interrogative pronouns, and only anma allows subject identity across
complement and matrix clauses with logophoric pronouns. Additional properties
emerge from consideration of each verb and its S-complements.","[851, 852, 853, 854, 855, 856, 857, 858]"
"     Concerning auxiliaries, moe constructions restrict modality and relative tense.
They allow speculative judgment epistemic forms CER ma (ólí ómóhé má' mòè íkèké
[the man PAP.CER have bicycle] ‘The man surely owned a bicycle’), DUB vba (ólí
ómóhé vbá' mòè íkèké? [the man PAP.DUB have bicycle] ‘Could the man have really
owned a bicycle?’) and bia (ólí ómòhè bíá mòè íkèké? [the man PRP.DUB have bicy-
cle] ‘Did the man actually own a bicycle?’), and assumptive judgment Hypothetical
kha (ólí ómóhé khà móé éghó' [the man PAP.HYP have money] ‘The man would have
had money’). Remaining epistemic auxiliaries (Deductive za, Resultative za, Con-
cessive rere) as well as deontic Hortative í are unacceptable.
     In moe constructions relative tense expression is grammatical. One finds ke (ólí
ómóhé ké' mòè íkèké [the man PAP.ANT have bicycle] ‘The man owned a bicycle
afterward’) as well as kpe (ólí ómòhè kpé mòè íkèké [the man PRP.SUB have bicycle]
‘The man owned a bicycle despite pending conditions’).
     moe permits preverb classes with some exceptions. Manner-demonstratives ìyó
and ìná are absolutely excluded. Phasal aspectualizers reveal a split. moe allows
phasal Additive gbo (ólí ómòhè gbó mòè íkèké [the man PRP.ADD have bicycle] ‘The
man owned a bicycle too’) and Durative se (ólí ómòhè sé mòè íkèké [the man
PRP.DUR have bicycle] ‘The man continues to own a bicycle’) but not Repetitive che
and Punctual ghe. Among boundary aspectualizers, only Past Absolute ya (ólí
ómóhé yà móé íkèké [the man PAP.PA have bicycle] ‘The man used to have a bicy-
cle’) and mo (ólí ómóhé mó' móé íkèké [the man PAP.PA have bicycle] ‘The man at
one time had a bicycle’) are acceptable. Ingressive ya, Egressive mo and Conative òó
are unacceptable.
     moe constructions selectively occur with evaluative and temporal preverbs.
They allow evaluative kuku (ólí ómòhè kùkú mòè íkèké [the man PRP.POEV have
bicycle] ‘The man afterall owns a bicycle’) and temporal kpao (ólí ómóhé kpá'ò móé
508 | Be, do, happen and haveíkèké [the man PAP.earlier have bicycle] ‘The man earlier on owned a bicycle’). They
reject other preverbs belonging to the classes evaluative (duu ‘for no reason,’ woo
instead’) and temporal (tua ‘hurriedly, bobo ‘promptly’ gue ‘unexpectedly’).
     Relative to subject attributives, moe constructions are highly selective. They al-
low gbúdu, but only in its quantity sense (ólí ómòhè gbùdú mòè íkèké [the man
PRP.really have bicycle] ‘The man really owns bicycles’ / *‘The man courageously
owned a bicycle’, ólí ómòhè gbùdú mòè éghó' [the man PRP.really have money] ‘The
man really has money’). Ungrammatical are remaining subject attributives (dégbe
‘steadily,’ totóbo ‘tightly,’ kakégbè ‘perseveringly,’ dábo ‘deliberately,’ dóbo ‘mis-
takenly,’ miti ‘able,’ dúda ‘defiantly’).
     moe constructions selectively admit quantity preverbs. They allow zemi (ólí
ómòhè zèmí mòè éghó' [the man PRP.ABSI have money] ‘The man has / possesses a
lot of money’) and zeze (ólí ómòhè zèzé mòè éghó' [the man PRP.NABI have money]
‘The man has / possesses a bit of money’). But they reject Emphatic Reflexive dobo
and Collective gba.
     moe also restricts verb affixes, postverbal complement particles and temporal
adjuncts. It excludes affixes associated with verbs: Perseverative Ci- prefix, Facta-
tive -i suffix and Distributive -lo/lo/no suffix (*ólí ókpósó mòè-lò íkpùn [the woman
PRP.own-DS cloths] ‘The woman owns cloths’). Relative to postverbal aspectual
particles, moe is found with Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe.
Nonetheless, moe rejects all deictic temporal adjuncts: ènyáà ‘just now,’ éènà ‘to-
day, òdè ‘yesterday’ and ákhò ‘tomorrow.’(205) a. ólí ómòhè móé       éghó' léé.
         the man PRP.have money TEMP
         ‘The man has money already / is already rich.’
      b. ólí ómòhè móé       éghó' gbé.
         the man PRP.have money much
         ‘The man has too much money.’Endnotes1
  Constructions associated with ‘be’ functions in Emai exhibit asymmetrical distribution with respect
to their occurrence in embedded S-complements. Copula constructions with nonuniform distribu-
tion are Equational Identity (EID), Specification (SPE), Class Membership (CMB), Locative (LCT),
Property (PRP), Existential (EXT) and Partitive (PAR). In direct speech and in indirect speech (coded
by complementizer khi), each ‘be’ predicate is acceptable, as suggested by constructions with EID
khi and SPE óò.

   The verb forms khaan and gba appear as simple transitive predicates with direct objects that
undergo a change of state rather than simply a change of position, i.e. direct object as semantic
patient rather than semantic theme, as does khuye with its sense ‘close’ (Chapter 11, 11.9.5 for illus-
tration of khaan and khuye as predicates).(i) a. òjè ò ó khààn àgá.

  In contrast to the contact end state V2 forms khuan and gon, the form nye does not occur as an
intransitive predicate with verb de in series.(i) *òhí dé'        nyé-í         vbí ólí óràn.
     Ohi PAP.fall move.against-F LOC the tree
     ‘Ohi fell against the tree.’22
  A verb form phonologically related to nye shows an obligatory reduplicative form. nyenye occurs
as an intransitive or transitive shape with change of existence state re in series. Encoded as ‘push
out, protrude,’ predication sense reflects a sustained position change rather than contact.(i) a. òjè nyényé      ékéìn ré.
       Oje PRP.push belly rise
       ‘Oje pushed out his belly.’

12 Transitivity and verb arguments
Verb transitivity in Emai gets reshaped by detransitive predications, which reduce
the argument profile of a predication, and double object predications, which aug-
ment argument profile. Detransitives are morphosyntactically marked by preposi-
tion vbi and its complement, an erstwhile direct object. Double object predications
(with e.g. fi ‘hit’) consist of juxtaposed noun phrases, the first of which is headed by
a human or animate noun and the second by an inanimate or abstract noun. Often,
the second object serves as direct object in a corresponding transitive predication,
as examples in the following sections indicate.(1) a. òjè é          vbí ólí émà.
       Oje PRP.eat LOC the yam
       ‘Oje ate from the pounded yam.’
    b. òhí fí'        ójé úkpóràn.
       Ohi PAP.hit Oje stick
       ‘Ohi hit Oje with a stick.’12.1 Detransitive predications
Detransitive predications are characterized by preposition vbi immediately follow-
ing a lexically transitive verb. Each detransitive predication contrasts with a transi-
tive predication.(2) a. òjè é         vbí ólí émà.
       Oje PRP.eat LOC the yam
       ‘Oje ate from the pounded yam.’
    b. òjè é          ólí émà.
       Oje PRP.eat the yam
       ‘Oje ate the pounded yam.’
    c. ólì òkpòsò húá          vbí élí íkpùn.
       the woman PRP.take LOC the clothes
       ‘The woman carried some of the clothes.’
    d. ólì òkpòsò húá          élí íkpùn.
       the woman PRP.take the clothes
       ‘The woman carried the clothes.’While transitive predications show a direct object realized by a personal pronoun
(óì), detransitives exhibit a vbi complement that manifests nondeictic locative pro-
776 | Transitivity and verb argumentsnoun (ò). Object position following vbi does not take accusative pronouns (e.g. óì) or
deictic locative pronouns (e.g. èvbò).(3) a. òjè é         óì / *ò.
       Oje PRP.eat it it
       ‘Oje ate it.’
    b. òjè é         vbí ò /*óì / *èvbò.
       Oje PRP.eat LOC it it yonder
       ‘Oje ate from it.’Detransitive predications exhibit additional properties when articulating sentence
aspect, aspectual interrogatives, realization verbs in series, verbal affixes, polarity
and mood as well as argument repositioning in discourse. Detransitive vbi predica-
tions restrict aspect. They inflect for Past and Present perfect but not imperfect Con-
tinuous.(4) a. òjè é         vbí ólí émà.
       Oje PRP.eat LOC the yam

    b. ójé é'       vbí ólí émà.
       Oje PAP.eat LOC the yam
       ‘Oje ate some of the pounded yam.’Detransitive predications reply to émé' u ‘do’ and émé' u ‘happen’ questions.(5) émé' ójé ú'-ì?     >          ò é         vbí ólí émà.

    what it PAP.happen            Oje PAP.eat LOC the yam
    ‘What happened?’              ‘Oje ate from the pounded yam.’Detransitive vbi predications reject realization forms fee ghoo and ba kun in series
(*òjè é vbí ólí émà féé ghòò / bá kùn [Oje PRP.eat LOC the yam try.inspect pur-
sue.in.vain] ‘Oje tried to eat / unsuccessfully ate some of the pounded yam’). On
their verb, detransitive vbi predications reject Perseverative prefix Ci- (*ólí ókpósó hí-
húá vbí élí íkpùn [the woman PAP.PERS-take LOC the clothes] ‘The woman still car-
ried some of the clothes’) and Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no (*ólì òkpòsò húá-ló vbí élí

pear as imperatives, prohibitives, negative statements and polar questions.(7) a. è vbí ólí émà.

    d. òjè é         vbí ólí émà?
       Oje PRP.eat LOC the yam
       ‘Did Oje eat from the pounded yam?’In discourse, detransitive vbi predications partially inhibit argument repositioning.
Subject corresponds to a focus position constituent but vbi complement does not.(8) a. òjè lí ó é'           vbí ólí émà.
       Oje PF he PAP.eat LOC the yam
       ‘It was Oje who ate from the pounded yam.’

        the yam PF Oje PAP.eat LOC it
        ‘It was the yam that Oje ate from.’12.2 Double object predications
Double object predications with shape NP1 V1 NP2 NP3 reflect two types. These types
are grounded to contrasting semantic relations underlying double object construc-
tions and the consequent participant roles of each relation. Across types, the first
object (NP2) requires a human noun that is negatively impacted by its event. In addi-
tion, NP2 manifests either of two participant roles. For type one, NP2 reflects a pos-
sessor role and for type two a causative role. Alternations between double object
predications and corresponding transitive structures direct attention to the contrast
in their semantic relations.(9) a. òlólò vbí      ójé éànmì.
