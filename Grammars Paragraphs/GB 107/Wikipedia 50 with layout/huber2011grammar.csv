"3.2.3.7 Negative verbs
Makalero possesses a group of verbs which are inherently negative in meaning. The
negative verbs found in Makalero are listed in Table 3.21, which also gives the
corresponding positive verbs, where possible.
The juxtaposition of the negative verbs with their positive counterparts shows, first
and foremost, that several negative verbs lack a good positive counterpart. For both
lesa ‘not have’ and na’an ‘not exist’, for example, the deictic verb ue’ ‘be there’ has
been given as a counterpart in brackets. This verb primarily predicates location
(§ 3.2.3.9, p. 180), but it is by extension also used to predicate existence. The
positive counterpart to lu’a ‘not get’ is a complement-verb complex rather than a
single verb; ti’a-mei translates literally as ‘towards-take’. There is no verb
specifically expressing the notion of permission; rau ‘good’ is used for this purpose
(see § 3.2.3.10, p.186, for details on the construction). Finally, there is no verbal
expression for something like ‘already’ to complement oko-na ‘not yet’. The aspect
marker hai (§ 3.4.3, p. 242) is generally used to convey this notion.

discourse by the negation of that positive counterpart with nomo. The pairs in (206)
and (207), and (208) and (209) for nopa’e ‘cannot’ and tule ‘not want’, respectively,
illustrate this. There appears to be no notable difference in meaning between these
two variant ways of expression.","[194, 195]"

the combination of so’ot ‘want’ with the negation. Nomo ma’en ‘not know’, on the
other hand, is more common than the corresponding negative verb isipo’. Nopa’e
‘cannot’ and me’e / hul ‘be able’, finally, are used in approximately the same
proportions.
The negative verbs and their positive counterparts, where present, are
morphologically totally unrelated.",[195]

negative polarity item ‘any’ (shown in (398)), or, in the case of a generic NP such as
exemplified in (396) and (397), a negative indefinite, as in (399).",[259]

Note, however, that the difference in reading between (399), where the amulafu
ho’o in subject position translates as ‘nobody’, and (396), where ho’o heads the
subject NP and is not read as a negative indefinite. This again contrasts with (398),
in which ho’o is the head of the non-subject NP (and thus within the verb phrase),
and translates as the negative polarity item ‘anybody’. It seems, thus, that ho’o, if
used within the subject argument to a negated clause, can have several readings.
Ho’o frequently occurs twice within a clause, contrasting two sets of a larger group.
(400), for instance, gives information on two contrasting subgroups among the civil
war fugitives on Mount Matebian.(400)    … aviaun u         mu’a rekasi=ni     ho’o umu ho’o lafu’.

overtly expresses the set to a part of which ho’o makes reference, as in (401).","[259, 260]"
"

    Oko ‘yet’ is a verb-phrase-internal adverbial (§ 3.2.3.3.1, p. 159). It is most frequently combined with
the internal negation nomo as oko nomo, which translates as ‘not yet’. Na appears to be a negative verb
which is never found except in combination with oko; the whole is thus regarded as a lexicalised unit and
is, as such, hyphenated.

Unlike other verbs, negative verbs are not compatible with the internal negator
nomo (§ 3.4.4, p. 242). However, the clause they appear in can as a whole be
negated with the clausal negator nomohaka (§ 3.6.1, p. 264), as (210) shows.","[195, 196]"

3.4 Grammatical morphemes within the VP
There are fewer grammatical morphemes associated with the VP than with the NP.
§ 3.4.1 (p. 241) discusses the argument-marking k-prefix, § 3.4.2 (p. 242) the
negative prefix ni-, § 3.4.3 (p. 242) the aspect marker hai and, finally, § 3.4.4
(p. 242) the negation nomo.",[266]

   Note the use of ua, rather than uai, for the clausal proform. This is not found with other clause linkers,
and is also rather restricted with =nata. It appears to be indicative of the degree of lexicalisation of the
form.

        ‘… why do (you) not come to visit me?’                                 (21-059)In affirmative clauses too, =konai is sometimes used even if there is another element
in the clause expressing the idea of one action causing the other. Examples are given
in (71) and (72); in the former, the verb (k)-asu ‘for’ expresses causation, while in
the latter, the Indonesian loan gara-gara ‘because (negative affectedness)’ is used.(71)    … so’ot=ini fi-lolo-ini=ua        Makalero ain ere        so’ot=ini uere’

        ‘It is because of you that our master now leaves me...’                (115-048)Note that =konai can be combined with other clause linkers. The combination with
=ini, yielding =konai=ni, is most frequent. Both simple =konai as well as the
combination =konai=ni are often used together with the general linker =isi as in
(73).(73)    ... kasian mundo ki-raranini          na’an=isi=konai ini la’a=ni

        with our in-laws.’                                            (33-29)The combination of =konai with other clause linkers is very frequent, particularly if
it stands on the clausal pro-form uai. This can result in rather complex conjunctive
elements with multiple linking elements, as in the example in (74), which uses the
form uai=ni=si=konai=ni. The elements =ini and =isi that are used next to =konai
in this complex are very unspecific in meaning, as discussed in § 3.5.2.5 (p. 247)
and § 3.5.3.1.1.1 (p. 250). The whole complex is more or less equivalent in meaning
to simple =konai, thus taking on the meaning of the most specific of its constituent
parts.

another linker, occurs at the end of an utterance. An example is given in (75).","[496, 497, 498]"
"7.7.2.1 Polar questions
Polar questions do not involve a question word. They consist of a full sentence and
expect an answer in terms of yes and no. Polar questions in Makalero need not be
marked morphologically as such. In such cases, it is only the rising-falling
intonation contour that marks them as interrogatives. An example is given in (117),
with the corresponding pitch contour shown in Figure 7.4. Note that the overall pitch
contour gently rises, reaching a peak on the final syllable; following this pitch peak,
there is a distinctive drop on that same syllable.(117)                    … ei so’ot=ini ueri                leuk?

answers to yes/no-questions. There is, however, no good positive one-word answer.
The Portuguese loan sim ‘yes’ is found in that function very occasionally. Also,
speakers accepted the verb tafi ‘true’ as a one-word answer upon questioning,
though such a structure was not produced in natural speech. In general, the most
common reply to a polar question is the repetition of a part of or the whole sentence.
Two examples are shown in (118) and (119).","[463, 464]"

specifically, questions to which the speaker does not know the answer. The
following clause generally contains the verb ma’en ‘know’ and is negated,
expressing the speaker’s ignorance on the subject. The indirect question can be
understood as a left-dislocated object to that clause’s verb of knowing. Examples are
given in (49) and (50).

(49) and (50), this is not necessarily the case, as (51), with what looks like an
affirmative, demonstrates. Note that =oo is used twice here; the first occurrence
marks the clausal object to ma’en ‘know’, whereas the second, cliticised on NP level
to the first person plural exclusive pronoun ini, corresponds to English ‘too’ (see
§ 3.5.2.1, p. 245).","[491, 492]"

The aspect marker hai follows the object slot of the VP. To the left of it are slots for
adverbials, the negator, the complement, and, finally, the predicate (§ 5, p. 317). It
does not appear to be phonetically dependent on either a preceding or a following
constituent and is hence analysed as a free particle. Hai marks the beginning of a
new situation; its precise semantics and use are detailed in § 5.3.1.1 (p. 361).",[267]

A construction where a clause with =oo cliticised to it is followed by the negative
existential na’an expresses the idea of something not being the case at all, or not a
bit, as (52) and (53) show.",[492]
"(210)    Ani       nomohaka           tule     la’a=po asi-ina=ni         sopen.

         ‘It is not the case that I don’t want to go, but I am sleepy.’   (pelic432)The negative existential na’an ‘not allowed’ is clearly intransitive, i.e. is not
associated with an undergoer. Lesa ‘not have’, lu’a ‘not get’ and tule ‘not want’, on
the other hand, are clearly transitive and include an undergoer participant in their
semantic participant frame. The cases of nopa’e ‘cannot’ and oko-na ‘not yet’ and
irau ‘not allowed’ are somewhat unclear with respect to transitivity. Used as full
verbs, they do not cooccur with non-subject arguments, indicating that they are
intransitive. On the other hand, constructions where they are used as complement
verbs suggest that they may take an argument expressing an undergoer; the evidence
in question is provided in § 3.2.3.10.2.1 (p. 193). Finally, isipo’ ‘not know’ is in all
cases used as a clause on its own, without any participants expressed. An example is
(211). It is therefore impossible to determine its transitivity.(211)    … elehaa ei asar=ee taure-fani’?               -   Isipo’...

         ‘… what was the old man who sent you like? - (I) don’t know...’
                                                               (120-115, 120-116)Oko-na ‘not yet’, nopa’e ‘cannot’ irau ‘not allowed’ and tule ‘not want’ are further
distinguished from the other transitive negative verbs in that they can take
subordinated complement clause extensions (see § 3.2.3.10.2, p. 193, for details on
that construction type).",[196]
"
3.2.3 Types of verbs
The open category of verbs can be classified into a variety of groups, based on
morphological and syntactic grounds. The morphologically-based verb classes are
those discussed in § 3.2.2 (p. 127), and the following sections deal with classes
mainly based on syntactic grounds, such that they are reflected in one way or
another in grammar. A classification of subgroups on purely semantic grounds is
avoided as far as possible. Classifications that encompass all verbs are those of
valency, discussed in § 3.2.3.1 (p. 141), and event typology in § 3.2.3.2 (p. 150).
The sections following these define subclasses of verbs, namely adverbial verbs in
§ 3.2.3.3 (p. 159), verbs with the third-person object marking prefix in § 3.2.3.4
(p. 163), weather and times of day verbs with fixed subjects in § 3.2.3.5 (p. 164),
interrogative verbs in § 3.2.3.6 (p. 167), negative verbs in § 3.2.3.7 (p. 169),
numerals in § 3.2.3.8 (p. 171), deictic verbs in § 3.2.3.9 (p. 180), verbs with
complement clause extensions in § 3.2.3.10 (p. 186), verbs of physical or emotional
states in § 3.2.3.11 (p. 197), and verbs with grammatical rather than lexical meaning
                                  LEXICAL CATEGORIES                             141
in § 3.2.3.12 (p. 202). § 3.2.3.13 (p. 210) and § 3.2.3.14 (p. 215) remark on
movement verbs and quantifying verbs, respectively, even though these do not
behave as a consistent group. Being defined on semantic grounds, these last sections
present exceptions to the principle of syntactically relevant classes.","[165, 166]"
"(118)                   Ei tafi isit? – Ani tafi isit.
                        2s        true ill       1s    true ill
                        ‘Are you really ill? - Yes.’                                                           (elic871)(119)                   Kiloo hai nami-ena? – Tone’ hai nami-ena.

(117) above, it is these superordinate verbs that are repeated as one-word answers
two polar questions. That is, a positive answer to a question as (117) is so’ot ‘(I)
want’.
Polar questions can be overtly marked as such by the markers =ua and =uai (na’an),
both of which are cliticised to the right end of the question. Note that =ua is
homophonous with the relative marker (§ 3.3.5.1, p. 240). While a historical
relationship between the two is unproven, it is a fact that relative makers very
commonly derive from interrogative words cross-linguistically. (120) and (121) give
440                                                              CHAPTER 7
examples of the use of =ua as a question marker (see § 7.7.1, p. 435, above for the
use of the same particle with declaratives).","[464, 465]"
"3.2.3.14 Quantifiers
The majority of quantifiers in Makalero are verbal. The only exception is ho’o
‘some’, which has quantifying semantics, but is analysed as a determiner (§ 3.3.2,
p. 232). Like motion verbs, quantifiers in Makalero do not behave as uniform group;
some of them are found both as full verbs and as modifiers in the VP and can be
classified as floating quantifiers, while others occur only as full verbs. The following
verbal quantifiers have been identified in the corpus.
216                                               CHAPTER 3
      all                      many                     some, several             few, little
      ata’u                    paun                     teteropa’ (u)             ka’u
      haka                     ropa’                    tauropa’
      hau                      rial (+HUM)
      fanu’                    roual (-HUM)
      felu
      kafu’118                                    Table 3.42: Quantifying verbsTable 3.42 shows that for most items, a variety of lexemes are available to express
the same meaning.
Among the quantifiers which denote the whole of a group, the most important one is
hau. It is a floating quantifier that can stand both within the VP, if modifying the
verb or the VP-internal argument, or as a predication of its own if modifying the
subject. § 5.3.3.3.1 (p. 376) discusses these constructions in more detail. Note also
that hau appears to be developing into a marker of completive aspect, as shown in
§ 5.3.3.2 (p. 369).
Haka ‘all’ is most often found together with hau in a complement verb complex of
the form haka-hau. There are a few cases, however, where haka occurs on its own as
a quantifier. Other items which stand in the same position as haka are kafu-, felu and
kopa. Like haka, felu and kafu-119 occur as quantifiers on their own, without hau.
The same is not the case, however, for kopa, which is only found in the phrase kopa-
hau. Consequently, it is not listed in Table 3.42 as an independent quantifier. The
constructions in question are discussed in more detail § 5.3.3.3.1 (p. 376).
Ata’u appears to mean something like ‘all together, all at once’. It is much less
frequent than hau, but can also be used within or without the VP as a floating
quantifier. It is discussed in more detail in § 5.3.3.3.2 (p. 380).
Fanu’ ‘all’, finally, is very rare, being found in only one instance in the corpus. This
sentence does not make its category clear; however, the /ʔ/-ending strongly suggests
it is verbal in category (§ 3.2.2.1.1, p. 128).
Among the quantifiers denoting the majority of a group, rial and roual ‘many’ are
counterparts, the first of which is used with human referents, while the second is
reserved for non-human referents. Both are used as full predicates only.
The quantifiers paun and ropa’ ‘many’ are associated with non-human subjects and
are rarely used in affirmative clauses. However, ropa’ appears in the interrogatives
tauropa’ and teteropa’ (both ‘how many’), where it is the only way to ask for a
quantity and is used with all kinds of subjects (§ 3.2.3.6, p. 167).
There are no dedicated verbal quantifiers for the concept of ‘some’. Teteropa’ and
tauropa’, which are found in this function, are actually interrogatives (§ 3.2.3.6,
p. 167). Teteropa’ is, as a quantifier, sometimes combined with the numeral u ‘one’.","[240, 241]"
"
 3.4.4 The negator nomo
The negator nomo stands within the VP between two adverbial slots (§ 5, p. 317). It
is not phonetically dependent on either a preceding or a following item; as such it is
treated as a free particle. It expresses internal negation, as opposed to external
141
   Note, however, that undergoers of the first and second persons are in the same context expressed with
the independent pronoun forms, rather than with the possessive form. The parallel between personal
pronouns and other pronouns thus does not go all the way. In fact, this highlights once more the
difference in status between the pronouns referring to the speech act participants on the one hand, and the
third person pronoun on the other.

negation, where nomohaka (§ 3.6.1, p. 264, and § 6.6.3, p. 398) is used. § 5.3.2
(p. 366) gives more details on its use.","[267, 268]"

This thesis is based on a corpus gathered during two fieldwork periods in East
Timor. Funding for these trips was provided by the Leiden University Centre for
Linguistics (LUCL), the Leiden University Fund (LUF) as well as the Swiss Society
for Endangered Languages (SGfbS).
Acknowledgements
The process leading to this thesis began when, during my MA studies in Zurich, my
then supervisor Dr. Philippe Maurer introduced me to a Timorese student, Eduardo
da Costa Guterres. His native tongue, Makasae, ended up being the topic of my MA
thesis. Eduardo’s commitment and enthusiasm convinced me that working in East
Timor would be a worthwhile and rewarding thing to do.
Dr. Aone van Engelenhoven, the present thesis’ supervisor, was also involved in this
endeavour from very early on – it was him who first made me aware of the
possibility of pursuing my doctorate in Leiden. He then accompanied me on my first
trip to East Timor, which would have been much much more daunting without him,
and I am immensely grateful to him. Also, he was always willing to read and discuss
any preliminary analyses and findings. None of this would have been possible, of
course, without the consent of Prof. Maarten Mous to act as my promotor. He was
very supportive and despite all his other duties always took the time to read parts of
my dissertation when I asked him to. It was a pleasure to work with him.
I also owe thanks to all other members of LUCL, who helped making my time in
Leiden a unique and interesting experience. An honorary mention goes to Camelia
Constantinescu, Allison Kirk, Jessie Nixon, Stanly Oomen, Kateřina Součková and
Rebecca Voll, who provided good company, a lot of fun and, thankfully,
conversation topics other than linguistics. I also very much appreciate Stanly’s
willingness to translate the Dutch summary of this thesis. Antoinette Schapper
proved to be a pleasure to have as an office mate. Another noteworthy member of
LUCL is Felix Rau, whose contribution to this thesis is so substantial that he has a
special paragraph all to himself below.
In Iliomar, the main town of the Makalero-speaking area, I am immensely indebted
to Carolino Assunção and his wife Joana da Silva, who let me stay in their house.
Their warm welcome made me look forward to every successive period in Iliomar. I
am also very grateful to Joana’s extended family, who took good care of me and
provided me with a lot of data. Furthermore, I would like to express my heartfelt
thanks to the teachers of SD1 in Iliomar, which is right next to Carolino and Joana ’s
house. Like this, there were always people to talk to, and another large part of my
corpus comes from the school staff. I would also like to thank everyone else who
was willing to share their stories with me. I hope this work does them justice.
In Lospalos, thanks to Dr. Ruben Stoel, I met Mafalda Rosa, who became my main
informant and closest friend in Timor. Not only did she always make time for our
sessions next to her work as a teacher at the junior high school in Lospalos, but she
also took me sightseeing and even accompanied me to Dili to see me off at the
airport. Being introduced to her was a stroke of luck. I would also like to express my
gratitude to Falda’s cousins in Dili, who offered me hospitality during the time spent
in the capital for administrative reasons, and in particular to Eligio Pereira, who
brimmed over with enthusiasm for my work. Martinho da Costa Van’s help with
transcription and translation, and the time and effort he put into it, are also greatly
appreciated. My heartfelt thanks go to the owners of Toko 8 in Lospalos, Mateus Li
and Natalina Lim, who invited me to join their delicious meals on a regular basis.
Their tremendous generosity is fondly remembered! A special mention goes to
Fernanda de Jesus, who helped me find a place to stay in Lospalos and was great
company. Also, I would like to thank Ana Godinho and Maria Sacchetti of Médicos
do Mondo, who kindly let me use their facilities (including the generator), thus
providing me with a comfortable work environment, and the Timorese MdM staff,
who were always willing to help. Thanks also to both MdM and the UN for letting
me ride with them to Dili and Iliomar a number of times. Not having to take the bus,
which departs at an ungodly hour in the morning, allowed me to get some additional
hours of sleep, which I appreciated a lot.
I would also like to thank my host family in Medan, Jakarta and Bandung, whom I
visited on my way back from Timor. After several months of fieldwork, getting
pampered by them was phenomenal.
In Europe, I was able to make contact with the Makalero speakers Hélio Cabral and
Silvano de Oliveira, who were willing to answer my questions to them through
email. Their help was invaluable, particularly before my first trip to Timor. By
coincidence, I got in touch with Hélio’s younger brother Olávio Cabral later on, who
was at the time a student at the university of Porto (Portugal). He was always
available online to reply to any questions I had, and our chats in Makalero were a
memorable and fun experience. In 2008, courtesy of Dr. van Engelenhoven’s
Fataluku language project, I was able to go for a short trip to Portugal, where I had
the chance to meet Olávio in person – he proved to be just as good an informant in
direct interaction as electronically, and also great company. During the same trip, I
spent a number of days at the IICT (Instituto de Investigação Científica Tropical),
where Vítor Rosardo Marques took the time to show me around the data on
Timorese languages that are stored in the cellars of the archive. My visit there was
very interesting and I enjoyed the work.
I would like to thank Sarah Brunner and Jacquelyn Coutre for taking the time to
proofread parts of this thesis – their efforts are greatly appreciated! I am furthermore
very grateful to my father, who did another reading. Quite apart from this, his
continuing support and affection significantly contributed to the termination of this
project. Thanks also to Filippo Svalduz for patiently helping me with various tedious
layout problems in the final phase. And of course the acknowledgments wouldn’t be
complete without a mention of little Pangur, who definitely helped me get settled in
the Netherlands. Unfortunately, he didn’t really like it here and moved back to
Switzerland. My father deserves additional thanks for taking good care of him
during my absence.
Last but not least, Felix Rau was an enormous help to me. A large part of the
analyses put forward in this book is based on discussions with him. During the
occasional bout of panic he always managed to calm me down and convince me that
things weren’t so terribly bad, and actually really rather good. Felix is a major
reason for my time in Leiden to be a success, on all levels. Thank you so much!

 1. Introduction
The present book is a descriptive grammar of Makalero, one of the 16 national
languages of East Timor recognised as such in the country’s constitution. It is
spoken in the subdistrict of Iliomar, in the south-east of the country. The location of
East Timor in the context of insular South-East Asia is shown in Map 1.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"(80)     [Ani rau-rau ei ira-tu’il                         mei=ee]SUBJ rau=uai na’an?
         1s       RDL-good 2s water-bamboo.container take=DEF         good=or    NEG.EX
         ‘Can I borrow your water container for a moment?’                      (elic325)(81)     Rau=ni         ani feesta-isi-la’a=uai na’an?
         good=LNK1 1s           party-at:RED-move=or NEG.EX
         ‘May I go to the party?’                                               (elic124)The opposite meaning, prohibition, is expressed by irau ‘not allowed’. It looks like
the initial vowel of this verb is a prefix that makes rau ‘good’ negative; however,
since no such element is found elsewhere in the language to confirm this idea, it
must remain speculative.
Another option for the expression of a permissive-like notion is the use of a
purposive linker (either =taa or =p-; see § 8.1.8, p. 474). Note that in (82), the clitic
=taa stands with a single clause only and can hence not be said to function as a
linker between two clauses.",[450]
"3.2.3.9 Deictic verbs
Makalero uses a deictic system with five distinctions which are based on vicinity
and distance to the speech-act participants, on both the horizontal and the vertical
axes. However, not all of these distinctions are encoded in all deictics. All five
deictics have regularly corresponding nominal and verbal forms. The five deictic
verbs in Makalero are given in Table 3.28. Note that all of them end in the glottal
phoneme (most often, in this case, realised as a glottal stop). These forms relate
directly to the nominal forms or demonstratives, which are formed with the -r-
formative (§ 3.1.2.1.1, p. 102). The demonstratives are discussed in § 3.3.2.1
(p. 232).      ai’ / e’                            ‘be here’
                                          near speaker
                                          same elevation      uai’ / ue’                          ‘be here’
                                          near hearer

the /ai/ diphthongs (see § 2.2.5, p. 67). The /e/ forms are more frequent in normal
speech. All of these verbs have reduced bound forms (§ 3.2.2.2.2.1, p. 132), which

are derived from the full forms as listed in Table 3.28 through loss of the final
consonant, the glottal phoneme /ʔ/.
The first two deictic verbs, e’ and ue’, are mainly related to the speech act
participants, with e’ used for the speaker and ue’ for the addressee. The other deictic
verbs are not specifically related to any person, though ume’, which literally refers to
a location distant from both the speaker and the addressee, may per extension be
used as a third person-related deictic.
According to Hull (2004: 84), Makasae and Makalero are the most conservative of
the non-Austronesian languages of Timor with regard to deixis, distinguishing seven
degrees in their demonstrative systems. While there are indeed seven degrees in
Makasae (see e.g. Brotherson 2004, Huber 2008a), Makalero uses only five
distinctions. This is due to the fact that the demonstratives in Makalero encode
information only about either the horizontal or the vertical axis, but the language
does not possess demonstratives which convey information about both these axes at
the same time. In this, Makalero differs from Makasae, which has separate terms for
‘above, no horizontal distance’ (do’o) and ‘below, no horizontal distance’ (ho’o) on
the one hand, and ‘above, horizontally distant’ (de’i) and ‘below’, horizontally
distant’ (he’i) on the other hand (Brotherson 2003: 36). Makalero conflates these
two sets of terms, distinguishing only between higher and lower elevation, whether
or not horizontal distance is involved (ude’ and ufe’, respectively). As a
consequence, its deictic inventory is short of two oppositions with respect to the
Makasae deictics.111 Thus, while the deictive system of Makalero is more
conservative than those of Fataluku and Bunak with three and two distinctions in the
spatial deictic system, respectively (see Hull 2005: 25 and Schapper 2009: 241), it is
less detailed than Makasae.
It is very common in Makalero discourse to predicate a referent’s location, either in
a separate predication with the free form of the deictic verb, or with the bound form
in the guise of a complement-verb complex (see § 5.2.2.2, p. 326). (236) through
(240) give some contextual examples of the use of these verbs, both as main verbs
and as dependent verbs.(236)      … kiloo ani hai leu “A-jua!” Uai=ni=si                             ani hai dur             “ani

111
   Note that all demonstratives except for the first person related ere start with /u/ (see § 2.2.2, p. 60, for
the idea that the glide [w] is an allophone of [u]). It is possible that this represents a fossilised morpheme
encoding distance from the speaker (which would mean that udere and ufere, said above to encode
distance on the vertical axis only, do originally contain information about horizontal distance from the
speaker).

A special construction, found several times in the corpus, is one where =oo is

presupposition (§ 3.5.1.2, p. 244) is only found with subjects. This marker is
relatively rare and hence not very important in reference tracking. Nevertheless, any
NP marked by =(h)aka is necessarily a subject. See also § 9.3.1 (p. 507) for tail-
head linkage, which, too, contributes to reference tracking.

9.2 Information structure
The terminology used in the present short discussion of information structure
follows Lambrecht (1996) in most respects. In that work, information structure is
defined as “that component of sentence grammar in which propositions as
conceptual representations of states of affairs are paired with lexicogrammatical
structures in accordance with the mental states of interlocutors who use and interpret
these structures as units of information in given discourse contexts” (ibid: 5). A
referent is interpreted as the topic of a proposition “if in a given situation the
proposition is construed as being about this referent, i.e. as expressing information
which is relevant to and which increases the addressee’s knowledge of this referent”
(Lambrecht 1996: 131). Focus, on the other hand, is defined as “[t]he semantic
component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion differs
from the presupposition” (Lambrecht 1996: 213). In discourse, the correlation
between subject and topic is generally very strong. In a typical clause, the predicate
asserts new information about this topic; it is thus the focus. This neatly describes
the unmarked case, in which the subject is the topic and the object part of the focus,
in Makalero. However, other constellations of topic and focus structure and the
grammatical expression of a sentence are possible. These are discussed below in so
far as they find grammatical expression in discourse. § 9.2.1 (p. 495) gives some
observations on non-canonical word orders, § 9.2.2 (p. 500) treats a specific focus
construction, and § 9.2.3 (p. 500) discusses some particles related to the structuring
of information.","[519, 520]"
" 2.2.3.1 Sequences of two identical vowels
In several instances, what is realised as a long vowel corresponds in fact to a
sequence of two identical short vowels interrupted in careful pronunciation by an
allophone of the glottal phoneme /ʔ/.40 (21) shows two examples.(21)         [lɔ:n] / ['lɔʔɔn]                lo’on                 ‘sky’
             [ti:] / ['tiʔi]                  ti’                   ‘pour (a drink)’Hence some long vowels are actually made up of a sequence of two identical short
vowels. This is also the case with the negative existential na’an, the most common
realisation of which has been given in § 2.2.3 (p. 62) as forming a minimal pair with
nana ‘elder sibling’. This process is regularly found with verbs derived from nouns
by means of the glottal verbaliser (see § 3.2.2.1.1, p. 128). For instance, the variant
forms [la'fu:hu] ~ [la'fu:ʔu] of lafu’ ‘live’, derived from lafu ['lafu] ‘life’, are often
realised in running speech as [la'fu:].",[89]
"
1.6.3 Lexical categories
All content words in Makalero are analysed as either nouns or verbs. Basically any
lexeme can be used for referencing and for predicating, hence the classification of
morphemes into these two classes is not straightforward. Nevertheless, I argue for
the reality of a noun/verb distinction in Makalero based on the fact that there are
some – largely unproductive – category-changing derivational processes, as well as
a number of lexemes which receive widely differing, unrelated meanings if used
either as prototypical verbs or nouns. § 3.1.1 (p. 100) and § 3.2.1 (p. 125) suggest a
semantic feature as a general identification criterion for nouns and verbs:
prototypical nouns, if used predicatively, are generally translated as “is an x”.
Prototypical verbs in referring function, on the other hand, may denote “the act of x-
ing”, “the product of x-ing” or “an instrument or object associated with x-ing”.
Makalero is largely isolating. The most productive morphological process is
reduplication. In some cases, it appears to derive nouns from verbs. Otherwise, with
both nouns and activity verbs, reduplication has a distributivity reading, denoting a
variety of referents. With stative verbs, it is generally read as denoting a high degree
of the property expressed by the verb. Other than that, an unproductive formative -r-
can be identified, which appears to be broadly nominalising in function. The suffix
-ini is another way of deriving nouns from verbs. Also, there is an agent noun suffix
-door, borrowed ultimately from Portuguese. Some more morphological variation is
found in the domain of verbs. There is an unproductive verbaliser in the form of the
glottal phoneme as well as some inflectional morphology. A subclass of
semantically intransitive verbs inflect for subject number. A more sizeable group of
verbs exhibits bound forms used in a complement-verb complex.
In the domain of nouns, there is evidence for the distinction of nouns with the
feature [+HUM] as opposed to those with the feature [-HUM]. The former can be
marked with a plural suffix, while the latter are not commonly found with this
suffix. Among [+HUM] nouns, there is a subgroup of kinship terms, which take a
special plural marker distinct from the one found with other human nouns. Another
way of classifying nouns is whether or not they take nominal classifiers. There is
furthermore a group of nouns which is obligatorily used in a possessive
construction; these include kinship terms and nouns that can be characterised as
parts of a whole. Despite the absence of special marking, these nouns can be
classified as inalienably possessed.
In the verbal domain, there is a major distinction between stative verbs and activity
verbs. Most notably, the VP-internal adverb hau ‘all’ is read as a marker of
completion with activity verbs, but denotes high degree with stative verbs. With
respect to syntactic valency, the majority of verbs is divalent. While the first of the
22                                                 CHAPTER 1
two arguments associated with these verbs is a subject, the second can take the form
of either an object or a complement. The two instantiations of the second argument
differ in position. Nominal undergoers are commonly associated with the object
position, while locations and goals are usually found in the complement position.
Pronominal undergoers can stand in either position. A small minority of verbs is
analysed as being avalent, i.e. have a valency of zero and do not take any argument.
These generally express temporal or modal concepts such as soohe’ ‘yesterday’,
tone’ ‘perhaps’, or atanana ‘first’. Other verbal subgroups are constituted by
negative verbs, interrogative verbs, numerals, deictic verbs, quantifiers, verbs of
physical and emotional states and verbs with complement clause extensions.
Furthermore, there is a sizeable group of verbs which are marked with the third
person undergoer prefix k- in the circumstances discussed in § 5.2.2.6.3 (p. 349). It
is argued that these verb forms are undergoing a reanalysis into free and bound verb
forms.
Closed lexical categories include free personal pronouns and their adnominal forms,
i.e. possessive pronouns; reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, the former also with an
adnominal form; two interrogative pronouns, mu’a- ‘who (BD)’ and sa’a- ‘what
(BD)’, as well as their adnominal forms; and an indefinite pronoun, riparipa ‘any’.
A class of determiners is made up of a series of demonstratives as well as ho’o
‘some’. They stand in the rightmost slot within the NP.
There is also a variety of bound morphemes. Apart from the derivational morphemes
mentioned above, these include plural suffixes, a honorific suffix, an agent noun
suffix, a nominaliser suffix, an enclitic relative marker and a proclitic attributive
marker. All of the latter are associated with the noun phrase. Within the verb phrase,
there is the above-mentioned third-person object prefix k- which is found with a
subgroup of verbs, the aspect marker hai and the negative marker nomo. Finally,
there is a variety of phrase-level clitics. The majority of these are clause linkers,
cliticised to the first clause in a sequence, that specify the semantic relation of that
clause to the one that follows it.","[46, 47]"

6.6.3 Status
Status, according to Van Valin and LaPolla (1997: 41), includes epistemic modality,
external negation and categories like realis and irrealis. Epistemic modality is first
and foremost expressed in Makalero by the adverbial predicate tone’ ‘maybe,
possibly, perhaps’. As a predicate of its own, it is not discussed here, but in § 7.2.4
(p. 420). Realis and irrealis seem to be of no consequence in Makalero grammar. As
such, the only representative of status in Makalero is external negation. This concept
is expressed by nomohaka. It is possible that the element -haka is connected to
=haka, a clitic marker expressing the contradiction of a presupposition (§ 3.5.1.2,
p. 244). Indeed, clausal negation (translatable as ‘it is not the case that…’) appears
to involve the contradiction of an expectation or presupposition in all cases. The
categorial status of this negator is discussed in § 3.6.1 (p. 264).
Nomohaka is found both clause-initially, as in (57), or following the subject
argument, as in (58). It thus behaves much like the avalent adverbial predicates
(§ 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141). As argued in § 7.6.1 (p. 427) for similar constructions with that
type of predicates, the subject of (58) can be analysed as standing in the left-
detached position.","[422, 423]"
"
1.6.5 The verb phrase
Most of the complexity of Makalero grammar is found in the domain of the verb
phrase, which is strictly head-final. The main characteristic feature of the verb
phrase is that there are two distinct positions for the verb phrase-internal argument
(see § 5.2, p. 319). The first of these positions, termed object position, is the leftmost
element of the VP. It is followed by the aspect and negation markers as well as verb-
phrase-internal adverbials. The second position, labelled complement position,
immediately precedes the verb and in fact forms a morphosyntactic unit with it. This
unit may be overtly marked by the use of a reduced form of the complement or a
bound form of the verb, or both. The two argument positions are mutually exclusive.
Either of them fills the verb’s single non-subject argument position. While the object
position holds only undergoer NPs, the complement position can contain either
nominal or verbal constituents. The nominal constituents express either undergoers
or locations and goals. Verbal complements, which are fully-fledged VPs except for
the fact that the verb may be in a dependent form, generally convey locative or
manner information. This construction type is also used in forming causatives,
comparatives, modal modifications, directionality, and the like (§ 5.2.2.5, p. 339).
There is some degree of flexibility between the object position and the complement
position for nominal arguments. This holds particularly for pronominal undergoers,
the position of which varies considerably. In many instances, it is a lexical property
of a given verb whether a nominal argument is realised as an object or as a
complement.
Any ditransitive verb, even those which are semantically intransitive and thus not
associated with an undergoer participant, is compatible with a verbal complement
expressing location or manner. If such adverbial information is expressed in the
complement position, the undergoer (if one is associated with the verb in question)
can no longer stand in the same predication, but must be expressed in a separate
predication with the help of the light verb mei ‘take’. The complement thus fills the
verb’s argument position. The fact that even semantically intransitive verbs are
compatible with a complement shows that any verb is syntactically divalent.
Verbal modifiers include an aspect marker hai, expressing the beginning of a new
situation, a negator nomo as well as a variety of VP-internal adverbials. § 3.2.3.3.1
(p. 159) analyses these as a subclass of full verbs which can alternatively be used as
modifiers within the VP.
24                                    CHAPTER 1
1.6.6 The clause
The unmarked word order in the clause is SOV. The subject argument generally has
little repercussion on the rest of the clause. With a number of verbs which inflect for
subject number, the number of the subject (whether overtly marked or not)
determines the form of the verb. Apart from this, the use of the reflexive pronoun ni
marks coreferentiality with the subject. Furthermore, the NP clitic =ini, analysed in
§ 9.2.3.1 (p. 501) as a contrastive marker, appears to be developing into a subject
marker, which is used whenever a speaker considers word order alone not to be
enough to clarify the subject referent. This may be the case in sentences with non-
canonical word order, or if the subject argument is considerably lower on the topic-
worthiness hierarchy than the second argument.
As mentioned in § 5.2 (p. 319), the non-subject argument can syntactically be
realised in two ways, namely either as an object or as a complement. Either of these
is a possible filler of the verb’s syntactic argument position. Any additional
arguments need to be expressed in a separate clause. Such multi-clause units are
termed ‘sentences’ and discussed in § 7 (p. 401).
Operators (as defined by Van Valin and LaPolla 1997: 40) that work on clause-level
in Makalero are aspect, negation and status.","[48, 49]"

This clause structure represents the maximum clause180 and is very rigid, imposing
strict syntactic constraints on the expression of participants. Consequently,
somewhat more complex states of affairs, such as those involving a predicative
adverbial expression or those with more than two participants, must be expressed in
two clauses, while they constitute, both semantically as well as phonologically, a
single event or utterance. Such sentences are discussed in § 7.1 (p. 402). The
biclausal expression of a ditransitive state of affairs qualifies as one argument
structure construction in Goldberg’s (1995) terminology.
In natural speech, a minority of clauses fill all the positions provided by the clause
templates in (3) and (4). In fact, the nucleus of the clause, or its predicate, is the only
obligatory element. Both verbal arguments as well as any kinds of periphery
elements are readily omittable, given an appropriate context. As such, a single verb
can make up a complete clause. Examples are shown in (5) and (6), which show the
negative existential na’an and the modal verb so’ot ‘want, like’, respectively, used
as minimal answers to polar questions. Both are full verbs, which can take a subject
argument and aspect marking, as shown for na’an in (7), and a subject argument, an
aspect marker, and a complement argument, as shown for so’ot in (8).","[409, 410]"
"
6.6.2 Negation
According to Van Valin and LaPolla (1997: 47), internal negation is a core operator,
and as such has scope over the aspect operator, which works on the nucleus level. In
Makalero, however, the situation is quite the opposite. The only real aspect marker,
hai, is outside of the negation’s scope. On the contrary, it is the negator nomo which
is within the scope of the new situation marker, as (49) shows; in this clause, hai
marks the beginning of the negated state. The corresponding positive sentence is
given in (50) for comparison.",[421]

set the frame of validity for the following clause. Similarly, in (100), the deictic verb

afur=ee ‘my body’ has no grammatical role in this clause, but sets the frame for the
following clause, determining its range of applicability. In both cases, the non-

6.7 Summary
Expressing Makalero clause structure in the terms proposed by Van Valin and
LaPolla’s Role and Reference Grammar is problematic in several respects. One
major difficulty is the fact that the VP-internal argument can be realised in two
distinct ways, namely either as an object or as a complement (§ 5.2, p. 319). These
two realisations are clearly distinct in their positions relative to both the clause
periphery and the aspect and negation operators. As a result, two separate schemes
(repeated in (64) and (65) from (3) and (4), respectively) are needed to represent the
Makalero clause.

Grammar has encountered a number of problems. A large part of these operators do
not work on clause level in Makalero, but on a higher level of organisation, the
sentence; consequently, they have been excluded from the present section, which
deals with phenomena on the clause level only. First and foremost among such
higher-level phenomena is modality, which can be expressed either as a separate
clause or as a complement (§ 7.3, p. 421), but also the epistemic modality part of the
status operator, which is always expressed as a separate clause. Another one,
illocutionary force, also operates on sentence level (§ 7.7, p. 435). This left only
aspect, (internal) negation, and the external negation part of the status operator to be
treated in the present chapter. In Van Valin and LaPolla’s analysis, these would be a
nuclear operator, a core operator, and a clause operator, respectively. My analysis of
the level of operation of these operators agrees with Van Valin and LaPolla’s only in
the case of the clausal negator nomohaka, while the ordering of aspect and negation
is inverted.
 7. The sentence
A consequence of the very rigid structure of the clause in Makalero (see § 6, p. 383)
is that a great many states of affairs, among them all including more than two
participants, cannot be expressed but in a multi-clause structure. Nevertheless, such
structures describe one event. These, I would like to maintain, form a unit of
different status than the clause chains making up utterances as discussed in § 8
(p. 453), and a term to designate such units that are intermediate between simple
clauses and utterances is needed. A frequently-used term for units larger than
clauses, but generally smaller than utterances, is ‘sentence’. However, a good,
universally valid definition of this concept is hard to come by in the literature (see
e.g. Matthews 1981, Crystal 1991). For instance, in Van Valin and LaPolla’s
massive 1997 work, it is very loosely defined as a “larger syntactic unit [than the
clause, JH], which may contain multiple clauses in complex sentences” (ibid: 29).
Since I make no use of the term ‘sentence’ otherwise, I adopt it in this study for a
unit intermediate between clause and utterance as described above. A sentence may
consist of either a single clause, or of more than one (mostly two) clauses which
pertain to the same extralinguistic event. As such, a sentence differs from an
utterance, which, if made up of more than one clause, describes separate events, but
can also consist of non-clausal units, such as phrases or interjections (see also Payne
1997: 378). For a more detailed discussion of the utterance, see § 8 (p. 453).
The term ‘sentence’ is in the present study mainly intended to capture the following
kinds of multi-clause structures: The first type involves structures which display a
mismatch between the semantic participant structure of a predicate and the rigid
frame provided by the syntactic clause template in Makalero. States of affairs which
involve more participants than there are syntactic slots in a clause cannot possibly be
expressed in single clauses. § 7.1 (p. 402) discusses such constructions. The second
type involves adverbial predicates, which, though fully clausal, are never found on
their own, but only in conjunction with other clauses. Generally, these clauses
express information pertaining to anchoring in time, aspectual properties of the
action, as well as mood (§ 7.2, p. 413). Similar notions may be expressed by such
adverbial clauses as briefly discussed in § 7.6.1.1 (p. 430).
Furthermore, the expression of (deontic) modality (§ 7.3, p. 421) generally involves
sentence units, in much the same way as constructions involving verbs of saying and
their complement clause extensions (§ 7.4, p. 425). Lastly, the conative with fera
‘try’ parallels the latter two types in many ways (§ 7.5, p. 427).
All of these sentence types can be found constituting relative sentences within a
noun phrase (§ 4.3.5, p. 295). This shows that the sentence as defined here is indeed
a syntactically relevant unit. The sentence unit is also used to account for the left-
dislocation of participants for the purpose of topicalisation or focalisation, which is
elaborated on in § 9.2.1 (p. 495). Formal evidence for the sentence’s validity as a
unit of analysis, such as the left-detached position involved in such constructions, is
discussed in § 7.6 (p. 427).
402                                                 CHAPTER 7
 7.1 Semantics / syntax mismatch
The most important reason to expess an event in the form of a multi-clausal sentence
is a mismatch between the semantic participant structure of the predicate involved
and the rigid syntactic frame dictated by the clause structure. Such cases include, on
the one hand, all states-of-affairs with more than two participants. (1) gives such an
instance: the verb fana ‘teach’ logically involves an agent, a recipient or undergoer,
and a theme. The clause structure as discussed in § 6 (p. 383), however, allows for
the expression of two participants at most. The first argument position is reserved
for the agent-subject. In the case of (1), this is the pronoun ini (1pe).181 The non-
subject argument position of the verb fana ‘teach’ in (1) is occupied by the recipient
ni-mata ere ‘our children’.182 There is no possibility to additionally fit the theme
uere (DEM.DIST) into the clause headed by fana ‘teach’; both its argument
positions are accounted or. Consequently, a separate clause is needed in order for the
theme to be expressed. For this purpose, the verb mei ‘take’ is used. Its sole function
in such clauses as (1) is to provide an open argument position in which to express
the supernumerary participant to the main verb fana ‘teach’. Mei could thus be
called a light verb (see also § 3.2.3.12.1, p. 203). The two clauses share the same
subject.(1)           … ini tone’ uere mei=ni                 ni’isi          ni-mata      ere      fana.
                  1pe perhaps 2DEM take=LNK1 simultaneous REFL-child 1DEM teach
              ‘… we will perhaps teach that to our children.’                                 (106-11)The two clauses in (1) are conjoined using the clause linker =ini (§ 3.5.2.5.2,
p. 249). (2), however, shows that this is optional. In fact, sentence units are among
the few contexts where unmarked clause linking can be found.(2)           … k-asu         ha’auein ho’o mei kini...
                  3:UND-for place          some take give.to.3
              ‘… give him some place...’                                                      (69-055)The most prototypical ditransitive verb, ‘give’, presents a somewhat special case in
that it is expressed in fused forms, which incorporate the recipient. § 7.1.1 (p. 406)
discusses the constructions found with it.
A second large group of sentence units which are due to a mismatch between
semantic and syntactic structures involve those where transitive verbs, which are
associated with an undergoer participant, are constructed with a verbal complement
expressing locative or manner information. As § 3.2.3.1.2 (p. 143) shows, basically
any verb can be combined with a complement expressing such circumstantial
information. Also, § 5.2.2.4 (p. 337) argues that such complements are treated like
verbal arguments in that they are possible fillers of the clause's non-subject
argument position. This fact is illustrated by a sentence like (3), in which a transitive
verb’s undergoer must be expressed with the light verb mei ‘take’ if that verb is
181
      Since it is common to both clauses in (1), the subject is expressed only once, sentence-initially.
182
      But see below for the mapping of semantic participants on syntactic positions.

combined with a VP complement. If that complement is removed, or its content
expressed as a separate clause rather than in the form of a complement, as in (4), the
undergoer can again be constructed as an argument of the transitive verb.","[424, 425, 426, 427, 428]"
" 3.3.1.5 The indefinite pronoun riparipa
Only one indefinite pronoun has so far been identified in Makalero, 136 namely the
reduplicated form riparipa ‘any’. It is most often found adverbally, as in (387).
There is no clear grammatical evidence that shows it is constructed as a
complement; however, the analogy with the pronouns discussed in the previous
paragraphs allows for this conclusion.(387)     … fi     harus ni-lolo-ini-isi-ne’et=ete              lolo urau           riparipa-lolo...
              1pi must     REFL-say-NML-at:RED-think=after say         not.allowed any-say

          must not speak randomly...’                            (98-20)A good indication of riparipa’s pronominal status comes from the fact that it can
also function adnominally, as in (388), just like the reflexive and reciprocal
pronouns as well as the interrogatives (see § 3.3.1.2, p. 227, through § 3.3.1.4,
p. 228).(388)     … asi-noko                     riparipa-amulafu=ni ko-horu              rau.

          ‘… my younger sister gets along well with anybody.’                         (105-006)
136
    Apart from this, there are no special indefinite forms; regular NPs are used in that function. For
instance, ‘someone’ is translated as amu u (person one) or amulafu ho’o (living.person some) and
something as sa’a u (thing one) or sa’a ho’o (thing some). In negated clauses, these phrases fulfill the
function of negative indefinites.
232                                     CHAPTER 3
3.3.2 Determiners
The most commonly used determiners are the demonstratives, described in § 3.3.2.1
below. There is only one other determiner, ho’o ‘some’, which is discussed in
§ 3.3.2.2 (p. 233). Both demonstratives and ho’o can constitute NPs of their own
(§ 4.1, p. 273). The same is not the case for the definite marker =ee, which is similar
in function, but different in status from the determiners. As a consequence, it is
discussed in § 3.5.1.1 (p. 243) with NP-level clitics.","[256, 257]"
"
6.6 The operators
Van Valin and LaPolla (1997: 40) define a class of operators to account for elements
representing “grammatical categories which are qualitatively different from
predicates and their arguments (…) they modify the clause and its parts.” Aspect,
negation, directionals, modality, status (including such things as epistemic modality,
external negation and realis and irrealis), tense, evidentials, and illocutionary force
make up their class of operators. Not all of these categories are relevant for
Makalero; the representation in (39), adapted from Van Valin and LaPolla
(1997: 47), shows only those that are more or less grammaticalised in the language
394                                    CHAPTER 6

as pointed out in § 6.6.1 (p. 394).
Another instantiation of the disparity between hai and hau is that the former adds an
initial boundary to verbs that do not include one in their semantics. Conversely, if
hau is used with a stative verb, it is not the case that a final boundary is added to the
verb in question. (221) and (222) show how hau and hai contrast with the stative
verb ma’en ‘know’; in (221), as shown above, hau denotes a high degree of the
property expressed by the verb, whereas in (222), the new situation marker hai
provides ma’en ‘know’ with a left boundary, which is not originally part of the
verbal meaning.",[398]

         lu’a (n)                            ‘monkey’Furthermore, there are some class-changing derivational morphological processes
associated with nouns and verbs, respectively. A particularly clear example is the
deictic paradigm (§ 3.2.3.9, p. 180 and § 3.3.2.1, p. 232), which includes nominal
and verbal forms. However, most of these processes are of limited productivity, and
there is a large number of content words which are never used with any derivation.
A working definition of the main lexical categories based on other than
morphological criteria, which can capture these, is thus needed in order to make
generalisations over lexemes belonging to these classes possible.
Haspelmath (2001: 16543) points out that, despite the above-mentioned problems, it
is generally possible to categorise word forms into nouns and verbs in individual
languages. As an example, he gives the word fōma’i ‘doctor’ in Samoan (ibid.),
which can be translated both as ‘doctor’ and ‘being a doctor’. This contrasts with
alu, which translates as ‘go’ and the ‘fact of going’, rather than ‘person who goes’
(ibid.). The former would be categorised as a noun, while the latter is a verb. Such
semantic correspondences can be used in the determination of word classes,
alongside morphological processes, if present, as well as syntactic characteristics.
In the following, I will use a combination of such semantic features as used by
Haspelmath (2001) as well as specific morphological alternations and derivations for
the purpose of distinguishing lexical categories in Makalero. Content words are
classified as belonging to one of the open lexical classes of nouns or verbs. § 3.1
(p. 99) discusses nouns, giving a tentative definition and distinguishing a number of
subgroups based on phonological, morphological and syntactic criteria. § 3.2
(p. 125) proceeds analogously with verbs. Most function words are particles or
affixes that are associated with either the noun phrase or the verb phrase, or clitics
attached on phrase-level. These closed-category items contrast with the open
categories noun and verb in that they do not participate in the functional flexibility
exhibited by those classes. § 3.3 (p. 217) treats closed categories associated with the
noun phrase, while those discussed in § 3.4 (p. 241) are associated with the verb
phrase. § 3.5 (p. 243) introduces a variety of phrase-level clitic. Finally, § 3.6
(p. 264) elaborates on some unclear cases.","[123, 124]"

6.6.1 Aspect
There is in Makalero only one aspect marker, hai. This marker denotes the
beginning of a new situation (see § 5.3.1.1, p. 361, for details). Its position is fixed
following the object position, but preceding all other verbal modifiers, including
negation, the periphery adverbials, and the VP complement. (40) and (41) give
schematic representations of this ordering.

        (ASP)           (ADV)* (NEG)       (ADV)* (COMPL)-HEADHai has scope over all modifiers to the right of it, including negation. According to
Van Valin and LaPolla (1997: 46), the aspect operator is nuclear and should
therefore be under the scope of the core operator negation (see (39) above).
However, the very opposite is the case in Makalero: as (42) shows, hai marks the
beginning of the negated situation (i.e. the beginning of the absence of stomach
pain).(42)    … asi-atupusi hai nomo isit.
              1s:POSS-belly NSIT NEG       ill
        ‘... my belly did not hurt anymore.’                           (101-137)It is not possible to negate a new situation with hai using the internal negator nomo.
For this purpose, the clause negator nomohaka (see § 6.6.3, p. 398) must be used.
Makalero speakers will, however, make sense of the clause given in (43) as in (44),
by interpreting hai not as an aspect marker, but as the reduced form of the speaker-
related deictic verb in a complement-verb complex. In this process, the initial /h/ of
the aspect marker, which is often very faint indeed, is dropped completely.","[419, 420]"

 3.2.1 Verbs in Makalero: a tentative definition
§ 3 (p. 97) highlights the difficulties in word class categorisation in Makalero and
other languages of the same area. Specifically, basically any content word, including
those that would prototypically be translated as nouns, can be used as a predicate,
and conversely, even those content words that are typically used predicatively can be
used as arguments. Such concepts as tense, aspect and mood are generally expressed
periphrastically, and any lexeme functioning as a clausal predicate can be thus
modified. Hence none of the typical defining characteristics of verbs, either syntactic
or structural as mentioned in § 3.2 (p. 125) above, are of much use in the case of
Makalero.
Nevertheless, there are a variety of stems which can be said to qualify as verbal. On
the one hand, these are lexemes which occur only ever as predicates in the corpus. A
few examples are given in (72). There is no occurrence of these items in argument
function in the whole corpus; as such, it seems safe to assume that they are verbal in
nature.which case the construction of lepa as a complement can be explained along the same lines as that of lafi
‘side’. However, such a putative locative verb is not attested in the corpus.

         fatar                                ‘force, oblige’Furthermore, there is also a range of morphological processes which are exclusively
found on verbal lexemes. Verbs can be derived from nouns by means of a verbaliser
in the form of the glottal phoneme. Also, there are verbs with distinct forms for
either singular or plural subjects, verbs which take a third person argument-marking
prefix, as well as verbs with special dependent forms used in complement-verb
complexes (§ 5.2.2, p. 320). Such verbal morphology is discussed in detail in § 3.2.2
(p. 127).
The verbal properties listed above define only specific verbal subclasses, but not the
class of verbs as a whole. Since there is no good criterion in either the
morphological or the syntactic domain that could subsume all verbs as opposed to
other lexical categories, the present study adopts a working definition on a semantic
basis as discussed in § 3 (p. 97). This strategy is suggested by Haspelmath (2001:
16543) and has been applied for nouns in § 3.1.1 (p. 100). It is based on the fact that
the meaning of a verbal stem used in argument function can be regularly derived
from the same stem’s meaning in predicative function, along the lines given in Table
3.4. A given morpheme found in both predicate and argument position can thus be
classified as either a noun or a verb, depending on the kind of correspondence
between the translational equivalents of these two uses.","[150, 151]"

a clause linker (§ 3.5.3.1, p. 250). One instance can be seen in (110), where =isi, one

provided in (113), with the linker =ini on the avalent verb raine’ ‘last night’ and in
(114), where a linker cluster consisting of =te’e and =isi is cliticised to soohe’
‘yesterday’.(113)   … ei-nana              Agapitu Barretu raine’=ni               hai   umu.

are preceded by the subject argument of the following clause, which is analysed as
standing in the left-detached position of the sentence (§ 7.6.1, p. 427). This NP is not
connected to the adverbial in any way and its position preceding the adverbial is not
evidence against the classification of the latter as avalent.
Aspect marking and adverbial modification, as shown in (110) and (111), are
characteristics of predicates, while external negation and the use of clause linkers, as
demonstrated in (112) through (114), are processes applying to clauses. Thus it is
obvious that such adverbial expressions are clausal units. There is no evidence
whatsoever to suggest that they are nominal. Hence adverbial expressions as listed
in (108) are treated here as a subclass of verbs which are distinct from other verbs by
being avalent.
According to their semantics, which express adverbial notions, avalent adverbial
predicates are not used as utterances of their own, but only in multi-clausal units
(§ 7, p. 401).","[167, 168]"

assignment governing operators is clausal > core > nuclear, where ‘>’ means ‘has

Among Van Valin and LaPolla’s operators listed above but not shown in (39) are
directionals, tense and evidentiality. These are not grammaticalised categories in
Makalero and are consequently not discussed here (some remarks on directionality
can be found in § 5.2.2.5.6 (p. 345); on the anchoring of a state of affairs in time in
§ 7.2.1 (p. 414); and on the expression of indirect information in § 8.1.9 (p. 476). Of
the operators that are listed in (39), only aspect, negation and status are relevant at
clause level or lower in Makalero; they are treated in § 6.6.1 (p. 394), § 6.6.2
(p. 396), and § 6.6.3 (p. 398), respectively. As their discussion in the following
sections makes apparent, Makalero operators do not conform to Van Valin and
LaPolla’s proposed hierarchy as reproduced partially in (39) and the associated
scope readings. Furthermore, modality and illocutionary force operate on levels
other than the clause in Makalero. Illocutionary force works on the sentence level
and is discussed there (§ 7.7, p. 435), while the expression of modality may take
either the form of a complement VP or of a separate predication or clause and is thus
hard to place in a schema as (39). It is treated in detail in § 7.2.4 (p. 420) and § 7.3
(p. 421; see also § 3.2.3.10.2, p. 193).",[419]

demonstrated through the fact that they are incompatible with aspect marking and
adverbs, can be seen along those lines. Makalero speakers tend to translate such
attributes into Indonesian with relative sentences using yang (notice, too, that the
intended meaning of (66) as well as the literal translation of (63) take that form in
English). Like other modifiers, ki=-modifiers can form noun phrases of their own,
without a head noun (see § 4.1, p. 273). The sentence in (69) gives two relevant
examples. Such structures are reminiscent of headless relative clauses.",[313]

create a boundary, even though it is not present in the actual verbal semantics. With
stative verbs, whose semantics encode only a state, this is the initial boundary. No
phasal verb or other complex construction is needed for the purpose.
The reverse, namely the addition of a final boundary to a state is commonly
achieved through the use of hai + negation. That is, what is actually predicated is the

          (*He is sitting, (but) not in the church)This may, perhaps, be compared to Neg-raising in English (see e.g. Croft 2001:
213), where a negation which semantically belongs to a subordinated clause is raised
to the main clause. The process involved here, however, appears to be the reverse,
i.e. lowering of VP modifiers into a subordinate structure rather than raising.
A VP complement is rarely obligatory171 or the only way of expression. In fact, VP-
complement-verb complexes can quite freely be broken up into two separate clauses.
The pairs in (73) and (74) as well as (75) and (76) illustrate this. (73) shows a
complement-verb complex with the verb (ko-)horu ‘with’; note that the main verb,
hifa’ ‘catch’, appears in the bound form -sifa’. This clearly signals that its
complement position is filled. In (74), on the other hand, tia ‘sleep’, which stands in
the same context as hifa’ ‘catch’ in (73), appears in the free form, rather than in the
bound form -dia. Hence, in this instance, the (ko-)horu-predication is a separate
clause, independent from the following verb. Similarly, in (75), ume-sein ‘wait over
there’ is a complex as shown by the use of the reduced form of the distal deictic verb
ume’ and the bound form of the verb hein ‘wait’. In (76), on the other hand, the
deictic verb forms a separate clause on a par with the hein-clause, as illustrated by
the fact that both verbs stand in their free forms and the appearance of the clause
linker =ini (§ 3.5.2.5.2, p. 249) between them. The semantic difference associated
with these variant constructions is subtle at best. It appears that the biclausal
constructions, as in (74) and (76), can be read as two separate, sequential actions,
whereas complement-verb complexes as in (73) and (75) refer to one event. In most
instances, the two constructions are used in equivalent ways. 172

   Where there is no conclusive evidence that two VPs form a complement-verb complex, such as in
cases where neither of the verbs involved have a bound form, these VPs are treated as two separate,
independent clauses.

VP complement thus clearly passes.
Similar evidence comes from reduplication, the only truly productive morphological
process to apply to verbs in Makalero (§ 3.2.2.3, p. 138). It appears a complement
verb can be reduplicated independently from the main verb, as illustrated in (77).
The complement verb dika- ‘short (RED)’, expressing manner in the first example in
(77), is a stative verb and receives the expected high degree reading when
reduplicated. (k)-umu- ‘kill’ in the second example specifies a result; its
reduplication indicates that this result holds for multiple participants. (78) shows that
the reverse is equally possible. The semantic result of the reduplication of the main
verb, continuity, appears to have scope over the whole of the complement-verb
complex.(77)      dika-dika-umu                             ‘cut very short’ (of a story)

   Note that this is not generally the case for complements expressing manner information such as in
(xxii), repeated from (41) above.(xxii)    ... ibu=ee                     dur=ee           fi   mei [rau]COMPL-pase.

possible and seems to have much the same effect as the reduplication of the main
verb only, as illustrated in (78). An example is given in (79). The reduplication of
this complement-verb complex appears to refer to repetition of the action as
necessary with multiple undergoers. Note that the constituent parts of the complex
are reduplicated individually, rather than the complex as a whole (see § 4.6, p. 316,
and § 7.2.3, p. 419, for the repetition of phrases).(79)      mi-mi-li’a-li’an                        ‘turn over’ (multiple referents)

complements
VP complements and nominal complements are equal in status. This is shown by
such an example as (80), where two complement-verb complexes, both with the
main verb la’a ‘move’, are coordinated; the first one, rei-la’a ‘go out’ has a verbal
complement rei ‘move outwards’, while the second one, oma-la’a ‘go home’, has a
nominal complement oma- ‘house’. The two VPs express comparable, but opposite,
notions in what are clearly syntactically parallel phrases.(80)      … noko             nana=ni           ta-eta-lolo=ni           nomo

          together:RED-pass NEG     together-RED-outwards-move     house:RED-move
         ‘… siblings don’t talk to each other, don’t walk together, don't go out
         together and (don’t) go to (each other’s) house...’        (21-048)The coordination of complements to one main verb as discussed in § 5.2.2.2 (p. 326)
for VP complements is not limited to complements of the same type; it is also
possible to coordinate verbal complements and nominal complements to one verb.
An example of this is the sentence given in (81), where the movement verb isa ‘go
down’ has two coordinated complements. The first of those, SMP-isi- ‘at the
secondary school’174 is verbal, while the second, mu’a ‘ground’, is an instance of a
nominal complement expressing the goal of the movement. (82) shows the same

   SMP is short for sekolah menengah pertama, or junior high school in the Indonesian educational
system.

kind of evidence, although in that case, the combination of the nominal undergoer
complement na’a ‘work’ and mei ‘take’ is largely lexicalised (§ 3.2.3.1.2.3, p. 148).(81)    … fi      la’a la’a la’a=ni            [SMP-isi]COMPL-[mu’a]COMPL-isa=ni...

        ‘... we work together and labour together...’                        (55-29)It is thus clear that verbal complements and nominal complements are treated as
units of the same syntactic status. Note, however, that combinations of semantically
distinct types of complements as in (82), where a manner complement and an
undergoer complement are coordinated, are extremely restricted. In fact, all such
examples appear to involve a partly lexicalised collocation such as na’a-mei ‘to
work’ (see § 3.2.3.1.2.3, p. 148). This may indicate that undergoer complements and
location and manner complements were originally distinct entities, which coalesced
syntactically to a large degree.","[359, 360, 361, 362]"

  To my knowledge, little previous research has been done on stress assignment in Timorese languages.
Stoel (2006), in an unpublished paper, discusses stress assignment in the neighbouring language Fataluku.
In that language, too, accents can move to different syllables of the word. Stoel goes on to draw a
distinction between lexical stresses (‘tones’ in his terminology) and boundary tones. The former are
associated with a word and are given in the lexicon, whereas the latter are associated with the end of a
prosodic domain and are inserted by the phonology. Finally Stoel defines a complex set of rules under
which lexical tones move to another syllable or are deleted, and boundary tones are either assigned or not.
He also mentions vowel lengthening under certain conditions. It thus seems that the discussion of stress in
Fataluku concentrates on similar problems as shown above to occur in Makalero. It remains to be seen
whether Stoel’s analysis can be adapted to account for stress in Makalero.
 3. Lexical categories
According to most basic textbooks, a distinction between at least two lexical
categories, namely nouns and verbs, is a universal trait in languages (e.g. Payne
1997: 32). That is, they posit a basic distinction between the expression of objects
and actions, or reference and predication. There is, however, no consensus over this
seemingly basic fact: specific theories may define other sets of basic word classes.
For instance, Croft (2001: 63) argues for three universal basic word classes, namely
nouns, verbs and adjectives, with the chief functions of denoting objects, actions and
properties, respectively. Yet another approach argues that word class distinctions
must be considered a matter of degree (see e.g. Sasse 1993).
Evidence challenging traditional word class theory has, among others, been adduced
from Austronesian languages. Specifically, many individual Austronesian languages
have been analysed as lacking a noun/verb distinction. This may be illustrated by
such examples as (1) and (2) from Tongan (Broschart 1997: 134, examples (15) and
(16)).(1)   na’e lele e      kau       fefiné
      PAST run   SPEC PL:HUM woman.DEF
      ‘The women were running.’(2)   na’e fefine kotoa e         kau     lelé
      PAST woman all         SPEC PL:HUM run.DEF
      ‘The ones running were all female.’These sentences show how the word form fefine ‘woman’ can appear as both an
argument and a predicate, without any overt derivation. The same holds for lele
‘run’, which can be used both as a predicate as well as as an argument. These word
forms appear to be unspecified for lexical category, and it is only their function
within a given clause (i.e. whether they are used in the nominal slot, on the right
edge of the clause in the above examples, or in the verbal slot clause-initially) that
determines their translational equivalents as either arguments or predicates. In fact,
Broschart (1997: 128) arrives at the conclusion that Tongan is a language which
completely lacks a noun/verb distinction. Such characteristics are not restricted to
Tongan, but are fairly widespread in Austronesian languages. These languages are
approximations of Gilʼs (2000: 194, 202) language type with only one single but
open syntactic category. In this language type, “all words and phrases exhibit the
same syntactic behaviour”. A good overview of the issue is given in Himmelmann
(2005).
Makalero, even though no member of the Austronesian family genetically, is spoken
in a larger area dominated by Austronesian languages, and it is similar to these
languages in several respects. Among those is the fact that the translational
equivalents of verbs and nouns can quite freely be used in both argument and
predicate positions, respectively. This characteristic is not commonly associated
with Papuan languages (see § 1.5, p. 12).
98                                              CHAPTER 3
In the Makalero lexicon, there is formal evidence for the distinction between
function words and content words; to wit, there is a bimoraicity requirement for the
latter (see § 2.5, p. 75). This means that a content word has to be either disyllabic or,
if it is monosyllabic, its vowel nucleus has to be long or a diphthong. There is no
such requirement for monosyllabic function words. As such the two lexemes in (3),
ni ‘mother’ and ni (REFL) are clearly distinguished.(3)       ni [ni:]                                     ni [ni]
          ‘mother’                                     (REFL)Within the class of content words, however, the evidence for a distinction between
nouns and verbs is weak. Though a lexeme may prototypically be used as an
argument, it can easily function as a predicate given the right context. Similarly,
lexemes prototypically used in predicate function can be used as arguments. (4) and
(5) exemplify this flexibility with a prototypical verb, the stative isit ‘be ill’. In (4), it
is used as the clause’s main predicate. In (5), on the other hand, the same lexeme
clearly stands in a nominal slot, preceded by the third person possessive marker ki-
(§ 3.3.1.1.3, p. 225) and the definite marker =ee (§ 3.5.1.1, p. 243).55 In this it is the
head of the subject argument to the following predicate, k-ua-misa ‘rise over (it)’.
(6) and (7) illustrate the same with a prototypical noun, meestri ‘teacher’. In (6), it is
part of the subject argument, while in (7), it functions as a predicate.(4)       … asi-atupusi hai nomo isit.

Even though this distinction is not as rigidly grammaticalised in Makalero as in
other languages, there are some indications that suggest it is a relevant factor. For
instance, there are some homophonous pairs of lexemes which carry radically
different meanings depending on their category. Examples are given in (8) and (9).","[120, 121, 122, 123]"

family tree representing all four of the Papuan languages of Timor is not quite clear.
With respect to higher-level classification, the non-Austronesian languages of Timor
have had a chequered history. The non-Austronesian nature of Bunak and Makasae
was first recognised by Capell (1943a, 1943b, 1944), who regarded them as Papuan
on account of their structure. Cowan (1965: 361) supported this view and suggested
a relation of the non-Austronesian languages of Timor to those of the Bird’s Head in
Indonesian New Guinea. Capell (1975) finally argued for the grouping of all non-
Austronesian languages of Timor and the neighbouring islands of Alor and Pantar
with the languages of the Bird’s Head and the Bomberai peninsula; these in turn are
argued to be a member of the extensive Trans-New Guinea phylum in Voorhoeve
(1975). This classification has since largely been upheld (see e.g. Wurm 1982, 1983
and Ross 2005).9
The Trans-New Guinea family, which covers a large part of the New Guinea
mainland as well as some nearby islands, may contain more than 500 languages.
Several researchers, among them Pawley (2005: 73), emphasise that the Timor-Alor-
Pantar languages are highly aberrant among Trans-New Guinea languages. Despite
that family’s enormous size and the fact that its members exhibit a wide range of
structural variation, it follows from such remarks that it is nevertheless possible to
identify a typical Papuan, or Trans-New Guinea, language type. A summary of

  Note, however, that it is contested in Donohue and Schapper (forthcoming); the final word on the
classification on the Timor-Alor-Pantar group has thus not yet been spoken.

to its phonological characteristics.

respect to nominal inflection, which is largely non-existent (except for the fact that
there is in Makalero optional plural marking). Another possible analogy is TAM
marking, for which serial verb constructions are widespread in Papuan languages;
although the present thesis does not use the term SVC, the adverbial verbs used to
express the majority of the TAM categories in the form of distinct predications may
qualify as such. In all other respects, Makalero deviates from the Papuan language
type.

Papuan language type, conforming to it with respect to general phrase headedness,
word order, as well as the place of the determiner and the modifier with a noun.
Makalero agrees with Foley’s 22 characteristic Papuan features 10 as reproduced in
Tables 1.3. through 1.5, in only 8 instances, most of which are found in syntax.
Apart from the vocabulary, syntax thus provides the strongest argument for its
classification as Papuan.11
Foley (1998: 506f.) contrasts this Papuan language type with an ‘Austronesian
language type’. The characteristics he lists for this language type may perhaps
adequately represent the Austronesian languages in the New Guinea area but cannot
be said to be characteristic of the Austronesian family as a whole and are thus not
reproduced here. Notably, however, Makalero agrees with Foley’s Austronesian
language type to more or less the same degree (i.e. number of features) as it does
with the Papuan language type. With respect to other features, it does not group
clearly with either of the two contrasting language types. Over very similar results,
Schapper (2009: 31) concludes that Papuan Bunak displays “a particular ‘insular
eastern Indonesian’ linguistic type which cross-cuts the distinction between Papuan
and Austronesian.” This conclusion clearly also holds for Makalero.
Interestingly, Klamer, Reesink and Staden (2008) propose an East Nusantara
linguistic area, in which Austronesian and Papuan languages coexist and share a
number of features which are partly of Papuan, partly of Austronesian origin. It must
be noted, however, that this linguistic area is based on only five relatively broad
features, of which only two are clearly manifested in Makalero (i.e. possessor-
possessum order in adnominal possession and the presence of an inclusive /

   The total of 22 counts the syntactic features in Table 1.5 each separately, despite the fact that most of
them are concomitants of SOV.

   Note, however, that word order is not a sound basis for language classification, since languages may
change their basic word order (see Heine 2008: 34f. for some contact-induced examples of this process).

exclusive distinction in the personal pronoun paradigm). Note also that Donohue
(2004)12 denies the validity of an area with linguistically definable borders in Central
and Eastern Indonesia. Instead, he claims the region is part of a typological
continuum between Northern, Western and Eastern Austronesian languages.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"

   Taru ‘put, place’ is another candidate for an Austronesian loan (cf. PAN *taRuq ‘put, put down’).
95
   Another member of this group might be the verb dur ‘wake up’. However, there is only one instance of
the /t/-form tur, which should be the free form. Also, the /d/-form does not occur in the same contexts as
the bound forms of the other verbs do. As such, either this variant is part of a different phenomenon
altogether, or it must be a performance error. At present, I am inclined to the latter view.
96
   Ena ~ kena ‘see’ appears to be a borderline case between a verb with a bound / free form opposition
and an argument-marking verb. The same holds for kini ~ ini ‘do’. See § 5.2.2.6.3.4 (p. 356) for a
discussion.

[h] with /s/. However, none of these verbs has been found with a filled complement
position, thus no examples analogous to those in (94) can be provided.
Again, whether or not a given verb has a special bound form is an unpredictable
lexical property of said verb.
The change from [s] to [h] is a fairly common one and suggests that of the verbs in
Table 3.8, the bound forms, with initial /s/, reflect the original form of the lexemes
in question. The group of verbs listed in Table 3.9 exhibit a variation between
initial /t/ and initial /d/. It appears devoicing is a more common process than the
addition of voicing. Again, this suggests the bound forms reflect the original forms
of these morphemes.98 The verbs listed in Table 3.10 are not formed according to
one system, as those in Table 3.8 and Table 3.9 are. Hi’e ‘laugh’ and kini ‘do’
exhibit initial consonant changes as is the case in the other verbs, except that these
two changes, from /h/ to /n/ and from /k/ to /n/, respectively, are not paralleled
elsewhere in the grammar. Ena ‘see’, uta ‘fall’ and umu ‘die’ add an initial element,
namely /k/ and /n/, respectively. It is not clear at present whether the prevalence of
the segment /n/ is in any way significant. kini ‘do’ and umu ‘die’, finally, are also
special in having two bound forms each. In the case of kini ‘do’, the form -ini
generally has grammatical function (either as a causativising device or for object
demotion, § 5.2.2.5.1.1, p. 340 and § 5.2.2.5.1.2, p. 341), while the form -nini is the
bound form of the verb in its literal sense, ‘do, make’. The distribution of the bound
forms -umu and -numu, on the other hand, is so far unclear. Note that a variation
between initial /k/ and Ø is the distinctive feature of argument-marking verbs
(§ 3.2.3.4, p. 163). In fact, it is possible that kini ‘do’ and ena ‘see’ started out as
verbs of that category. However, they were at one point reanalysed as expressing a
distinction between bound and free verb forms. § 5.2.2.6.3.4 (p. 356) suggests that
the whole class of argument-marking verbs is currently undergoing a similar process
of reanalysis.","[161, 162]"

This having been said, it must be pointed out that in most cases, the placement of
modifiers within or without the complement VP does not appear to be associated
with the expected scope readings. Rather, they seem to be mere positional variants,
which, according to speaker judgements, mean the same thing. The pair of sentences
in (71) and (72) gives such an example. Note that a translation as the asterisked one
given in (72), which attempts to capture the expected complement-internal scope of
the negation, was specifically refused.","[358, 359]"

only obligatory part of the VP is its head, the predicate. An avalent verb is
compatible only with aspect marking and adverbial modifiers, but does not take any
arguments. The modifiers of a verb phrase headed by divalent verbs, on the other
hand, include aspect marking, verb-phrase-internal adverbials and negation. There
are two positions for adverbials, one preceding and the other following the negation,
allowing for the expression of scope differences. Each of these adverbial positions
can hold one or more adverbial verbs of the group discussed in § 3.2.3.3.1 (p. 159).
The only difference between the two variant schemes for VPs headed by divalent
verbs in (2) and (3) is the position of the non-subject argument, which is VP-initial
in (2), standing to the left of all modifiers, but immediately preverbal in (3), where it
is preceded by all these modifiers. An immediately preverbal non-subject argument
as in (2) forms a morphosyntactic unit with the following predicate, as indicated in
the scheme by the use of the hyphen. In order to distinguish these two argument
positions, the VP-initial position as depicted in (2) is called object position, while
the immediately preverbal position as depicted in (3) is termed complement position.
Both of these positions can hold several coordinated arguments. The schematic
representations in (2) and (3) show that the two positions are mutually exclusive; a
