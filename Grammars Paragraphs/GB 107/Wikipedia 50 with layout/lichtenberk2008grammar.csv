19.4.   Answers to questions19.4.1. Answers to polar questionsWith respect to polar questions, Toqabaqita has an agree/disagree answer sys-
tem, sometimes in combination with an echo system (Sadock and Zwicky
1985). A positive (agree) answer pro-sentence element is used when the polar-
ity of the answer agrees with the polarity of the question, and a negative con-
struction is used when the polarity of the answer disagrees with the polarity of
the question. In a pure echo system, “… no special answer words are used at
all. Simple positive and negative responses to questions involve repeating the
verb of the question, with or without additional material ....” (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985: 191). In Toqabaqita, pro-sentence answer elements are some-
times combined with echo answers; alternatively, an echo answer may occur by
itself, without a pro-sentence element.
    There are four “agree” pro-sentence lexemes and one “disagree” type con-
struction. For convenience, the agree lexemes are glossed ‘yes’ and the disagree
construction is glossed ‘no’, ‘(it is) not’, but these glosses do not fully corre-
spond to the meanings of yes and no (because the English system is not of the
agree/disagree type). The gloss ‘yes’ will be in double quotes (“yes”) when the
agree elements occur in sentences that are answers to negative-polarity ques-
tions. The agree elements are listed in (19-149):(19-149)   agree pro-sentence lexemes: iu, aqaa, mania, uaqa   Of these, iu and aqaa are most common, with iu somewhat more common
than aqaa, while uaqa is least common. (All four all also used to express ac-
knowledgement with what somebody else is saying, and iu, aqaa and mania are
also used to link sentences; see examples [27-55] and [27-56] in section
27.3.2.)
   The disagree construction consists of the negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be
the case’ (section 17.3) with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker.
The subject marker and the verb normally form one phonological word, with
the stress falling on the subject marker (section 2.5).

used only in replies to positive-polarity questions.
   Answers to positive-polarity questions are discussed and illustrated first. In
the next set of examples, the first four illustrate the four agree lexemes:(19-151)   A: Qo           alu-a      ta   malefo?

           B: ‘No.’ ‘Not at all.’   Sentences that express agree-type and disagree-type answers can contain, in
addition to the pro-sentence elements or in addition to the negative construc-
tion, echoes of the interrogatives, with the appropriate adjustments in pronouns
and other deictic elements, and possibly with some additional material.","[881, 882, 883, 884]"

           A: ‘Have you bathed?’
           B: ‘Not yet.’   An answer to a yes/no question may consist of just a (partial) echo, without
a pro-sentence element:(19-161)   A: Mista     Fanis,      kai        too          quu
              Mister    Fanis       3SG.IPFV   be.around    ANTCONT               ba-na?

           A: ‘Mr Fanis, is he still around?’ (Be around in the sense of ‘be
              alive’.)
           B: ‘He is around.’    Replies to negative-polarity polar questions are discussed next. In sentences
that are replies to negative-polarity questions, echoing of the interrogative is
more common than in sentences that are replies to positive-polarity questions,
especially when the reply is of the disagree type. When the reply is of the agree
type, an agree element may occur by itself, or an echo may occur by itself, or an
agree element and an echo may be combined. In (19-162) only an agree lexeme
is used.

              A: ‘Ulufaalu is not awake?’
              B: ‘No (he is not awake).’    When a sentence that is a reply to a negative-polarity polar question con-
tains an echo, the echo is grammatically negative, as is the question. The echo
is grammatically negative not because the answer is of the disagree type but
because it is an echo of a negative interrogative. A negative echo and an agree
pro-sentence element can cooccur, as in (19-163):(19-163)   A: Qosi         rongo-a?

           A: ‘Are you not hungry?’
           B: ‘(No,) I am not hungry.’   To express disagree-type replies to negative-polarity questions, only positive
echo-type answers are used. The disagree construction qe aqi is not used, with
or without an echo.","[884, 885, 886]"

Chapter 17
Negation
17.1.    IntroductionToqabaqita has only a small number of types of elements used to express nega-
tion. In the present-day language there are only two types commonly used:
negative subject markers and a negative verb. There is also a set of archaic
dehortative markers (section 20.3.2). Negation concerning (types of) partici-
pants is also achieved by means of negative existential sentences (section
26.1.2.2). In spite of the relative paucity of the types of negative elements (or
perhaps because of it), the area of negation is rather complex.
    With one exception (see [17-4] further below), negation in Toqabaqita can
be characterized as predicate negation, for the following reasons. First, the
negative subject markers occur inside the verb phrase. And second, the negative
verb heads a predicate, even though clauses that contain the negative verb are
not always fully-fledged clauses.
    There are three basic negative strategies in Toqabaqita: (i) a simple negative
construction, where negation is expressed by means of the negative subject
markers alone; (ii) a lexical negative verb ‘not be so, not be the case’, ‘not ex-
ist’, ‘not be available’; and (iii) a double negative construction, which consists
of a negative event clause preceded by a “mini-clause” that contains the nega-
tive verb. These strategies are exemplified in (17-1), (17-2), and (17-3), respec-
tively:(17-1)     Keeroqa kesi         fula.
           3DU      3DU.NEG     arrive
           ‘The two of them did not arrive.’(17-2)     A: Qo           riki-a           naqa?
              2SG.NFUT     see-3SG.OBJ      PRF           B: Qe=aqi.
              3SG.NFUT=not.be.so
           A: ‘Have you seen it?’
           B: ‘No.’
                                      17.2 The simple negative construction   735(17-3)     Nau qe               aqi     kwasi   rongo       qoe.
           1SG 3SG.NFUT NEGV            1SG.NEG hear        2SG
           ‘I didn’t hear you.’   There is one construction where the negation is not of the predicate type:
when a verb with the third-person singular negative subject marker serves as a
noun modifier (section 6.10):(17-4)     Wane baa wane        si    maqu.
           man that man         NEG be.afraid
           ‘That man (is) a man (who is) not afraid.’ ‘That man is a man with-
           out fear.’
17.2.    The simple negative constructionIn the simple negative construction, negation is achieved solely by means of the
negative subject markers. These are listed in table 4.5 in section 4.8. The nega-
tive subject markers both express negation and index the subject. With one
exception they are bimorphemic: the first element encodes the subject, and the
second element the negation.","[786, 787, 788]"
"(17-10)      Fanga naqi si            qako        leqa.

             ‘This food is not cooked well.’   See also (17-6) further above.
   In one type of construction only simple negation is possible, not double ne-
gation. This is the case in non-predicate negation, where the verb complex
functions as a modifier of a noun:
                                          17.2 The simple negative construction     737(17-11)     fanua     si    rodo
            place     NEG be.dark
            ‘place (that is) not dark’, ‘place without darkness’ (referring to
            Christian heaven)    For another example see (17-4) above.
    The other type of construction in which the third-person negative subject
marker is normally used in the simple negative strategy expresses “negative
additiveness”. In negative additiveness, one state of affairs is characterized as
not being accompanied by one or more other states of affairs, usually contrary
to expectation, contrary to what is normally the case. The first clause is posi-
tive, while the following clause or clauses is/are negative. The first clause ex-
presses a situation that obtains, and the second, negated clause asserts that an-
other situation that might or should have obtained prior to it, simultaneously
with it, or instead of it, is, in fact, not taking place or did not, in fact, take place.
With one type of exception (see further below), the subjects of the two clauses
must be the same, but the negative clause/clauses does/do not contain a subject
phrase. The clauses are normally in asyndetic coordination.","[789, 790]"

            3SG.NFUT not.be.the.case
            ‘I’ll come and see you again next Sunday, without fail (lit.: it will
            not not be the case).’   The lexical verb aqi is used in a bi-clausal construction to signal that a po-
tential situation will/should not obtain because of some disabling conditions
(section 17.6). It is also used in negative counterparts of grammatically positive
verbless sentences, and to negate fragments of clauses from which the verb
complex has been omitted; see section 27.2.5.
   Occasionally, although only relatively rarely, the final vowel of aqi is real-
ized as [']. This may happen when the third person singular nonfuture subject
marker qe and aqi fuse together as one phonological word, in particular as a
negative answer to a question: [!'pa!'] ‘No’. (For fusion of qe and aqi see fur-
ther below in the next section.)
17.4.     The double negative constructionA clause may be negated grammatically solely by means of a negative subject
marker. There is, however, also a complex, double negative construction that
consists of an event clause negated by means of a negative subject marker pre-
ceded by a “mini-clause” that consists of the negative verb aqi and a third per-
son singular subject marker. Furthermore, the aqi mini-clause may be preceded
by a noun phrase that corresponds to the subject of the event clause. The event
clause cannot contain a subject phrase. Two subtypes of the double negative
construction need to be distinguished, depending on the subject marker in the
aqi mini-clause. In one, the subject marker is the third person singular nonfu-
ture form qe. For convenience, this construction will be referred to as the “gen-
eral” double negative construction. Its structure is shown schematically in (17-
24):(17-24)     (NP) [qe aqi] [negative.event.clause]   For example:(17-25)     [Qe          aqi]     [kwasi riki-a].

           ‘[In the old days, when a woman who was the wife of another man
           asked me to give her something,] I would not hand it to her directly
           (lit.: I would not touch her hand[s]).’ (I would put it on the ground
           and she would pick it up.)    In the other subtype, the subject marker in the aqi mini-clause is the third
person singular sequential form ka. This type of negative construction is joined
to a preceding clause or sentence, with or without the coordinating construction
ma ‘and’. This construction is used to express unfulfilled expectation: a situa-
tion expressed or implied in preceding discourse did/does not obtain. For con-
venience, this kind of construction will be referred to as the “sequential” double
negative construction. Its structure is shown schematically in (17-27):(17-27)    … (ma) (NP) [ka aqi] ([negative.event.clause])   For example:(17-28)    Kamiliqa mili                    lio, ka      aqi
           1PL(EXCL) 1PL(EXCL).NFUT         look 3SG.SEQ NEGV           misi              riki-a       ta    wane.

           ‘I did ask him, but (lit.: and) he did not answer me.’    The sequential negative construction is discussed in section 16.3, where
more examples can be found. As also shown there, in clauses expressing unful-
filled expectations aqi also functions as a lexical verb when there is no negative
event clause:(17-30)    Sa     keki    lae mai, ma ka             aqi.
           IRR    3PL.FUT go   VENT and 3SG.SEQ not.be.so
           ‘They should have come but did not.’ ‘They were expected to come
           but did not.’
                                       17.4 The double negative construction   743   In general, negation expresses denial of a presupposition or contradiction
(Givón 1984), which in itself does not distinguish between the general negative
construction and the sequential one. However, there are several types of differ-
ence between the two. First, the two constructions use different third person
singular subject markers in the aqi mini-clause: nonfuture and sequential, re-
spectively. Second, the sequential construction is usually structurally closely
integrated with the preceding discourse. More often than not, it and the preced-
ing clause(s) are part of the same sentence. On the other hand, there is often no
such integration in the case of the general negative construction. Sentences with
the general construction may be used without any prior relevant discourse:(17-31)    Qe          aqi      qosi           thaofa?
           3SG.NFUT NEGV        2SG.NEG        be.hungry
           ‘Aren’t you hungry?’(For the use of negative polar interrogatives see section 19.2.1.)
   Third, in the case of the sequential negative construction, the expected situa-
tion is either explicitly expressed or strongly implied in a preceding clause,
while the presupposition denied or contradicted by the general construction
need not be. For one thing, there need not be any directly relevant preceding
discourse. Fourth, the general double negative construction has a simple coun-
terpart, where negation is achieved by the negative subject markers alone. The
sequential negative construction has no such counterpart. And finally, there are
also prosodic differences between the two constructions. These are discussed
further below.
   With the exception of non-predicate negation, where the verb complex func-
tions as a noun modifier, the general double negative strategy is available wher-
ever the simple strategy is. The double negative construction is strongly pre-
ferred over the simple one if the subject of the negative event clause is third-
person singular. In (17-32) the double construction is used in the first part of
the sentence, where the event clause has a third-person singular subject, and the
simple construction is used in the final clause, which has a first-person singular
subject:(17-32)    Nia    e=aqi         si      naqo-fi nau, nau
           3SG    3SG.NFUT=NEGV 3SG.NEG face-TR 1SG 1SG           kwasi     naqo-fi-a.
           1SG.NEG front-TR-3.OBJ
           ‘She would not face me, (and) I would not face her.’ (In earlier
           times, this was the proper way for a man and a woman who were not
           husband and wife to be positioned when speaking to each other.)
744    Negation
   The double construction may be used when the negation is to be made some-
what emphatic. For example, a person is more likely to use (17-33a) rather than
(17-33b) if he or she wants to emphasize that they are not hungry:(17-33)    a.     Nau qe=aqi         kwasi  thaofa.
                  1SG 3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG.NEG be.hungry
                  ‘I am not hungry.’           b.     Nau kwasi      thaofa.
                  1SG 1SG.NEG be.hungry
                  ‘I am not hungry.’   However, the double construction is also commonly used in non-emphatic
negation.
   There is one grammatical difference between the simple and the general
double negative constructions that concerns the expression of the subject. In the
simple construction, the event clause may have a subject noun phrase, lexical or
pronominal, in addition to the negative subject marker:(17-34)    Toqa     baa kesi         fula.
           people that 3PL.NEG arrive
           ‘The people did not arrive.’(17-35)    Nau kwasi      thaofa.
           1SG 1SG.NEG be.hungry
           ‘I am not hungry.’    On the other hand, in the double construction, no subject noun phrase is
possible in the event clause. The only way the relevant participant may be en-
coded by a noun phrase is as a topic preceding the mini-clause with the nega-
tive verb aqi:(17-36)
   NP(TOPIC)i [subject.marker aqi] [negative.subject.markeri verb ...]    This is illustrated by the grammaticality of (17-37a) and the ungrammatical-
ity of (17-37b):(17-37)    a. Nau qe=aqi         kwasi  thaofa.
              1SG 3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG.NEG be.hungry

              (‘I am not hungry.’)   Compare the ungrammatical (17-37b), with the subject pronoun in the event
clause, and the grammatical (17-35), with the subject in the simple negative
construction.
   Topic noun phrases are not obligatory with the double negative construction,
as illustrated in (17-38), which is synonymous with (17-37a) (and with [17-
35]):(17-38)    Qe=aqi             kwasi thaofa.
           3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG.NEG be.hungry
           ‘I am not hungry.’   The noun phrase that precedes the aqi mini-clause is not its subject; it is a
topic phrase. The subject marker of aqi can only be third-person singular, re-
gardless of the grammatical person and number of the preceding noun phrase.
In (17-37a) further above, that noun phrase is first person singular, and in (17-
39) below it is first person plural exclusive.","[793, 794, 795, 796, 797, 798]"

           ‘The Government punished them, punished them hard, (but) they
           were not afraid; ….’    Although the double negative constructions are composed of an event clause
and a mini-clause with the negative verb aqi, and although the noun phrase (if
there is one) coreferential with the subject marker of the event clause is a topic,
not a subject, the facts of the matter are not quite straightforward. First, the
subject marker of aqi can only be third-person singular and it does not have a
referent. And second, there is prosodic evidence that argues against full clausal
status of the aqi “clause”. Some of the evidence concerns both the general and
the sequential constructions, while other evidence concerns only the former.
The prosodic evidence is as follows.
    First, in the general double negative construction the nonfuture subject
marker qe and the negative verb aqi typically fuse phonologically into one
word, and, as is the case with words, stress falls on the first syllable: [!'p!+].
Such fusion and stress shift also sometimes take place when aqi functions as a
lexical verb, in particular in simple negative responses to questions, where qe
aqi alone (or possibly with a postverbal particle) constitues the response: ‘No’;
see (17-2) in section 17.1 for an example. On the other hand, although the se-
quential subject marker ka may cliticize onto the verb aqi in the sequential
negative construction, the stress is retained on the first syllable of the verb:
[kap!+]. The fusion of qe and aqi as [!'p!+] is indicated in the examples. This is
the only type of fusion that does not involves shortening of one or both of the
elements that is indicated, because it may be indicative of a major change in
progress (see further below).
    Second, neither in the general nor in the sequential negative construction
does the aqi mini-clause have its own intonation contour, while this is often the
case with the first of two conjoined clauses elsewhere (section 28.1). Rather,
the mini-clause and the event clause fall intonationally together under one con-
tour.
    Third, neither in the general nor in the sequential constructions, if there is a
topic noun phrase preceding the aqi clause, does the topic normally receive its
own intonation contour nor is it normally separated from the aqi mini-clause by
a pause, while both are often the case with topics elsewhere (section 38.2).
   And fourth, the tight structural link between an aqi mini-clause and the fol-
lowing event clause is evidenced by the fact that in relativization on a constitu-
ent of the event clause the aqi mini-clause is included in the relative construc-
tion together with the event clause. In (17-41) in relativization on the direct
object of the event clause, the relative clause marker na (realized as n= because
of fusion) comes before the aqi mini-clause:

            ‘That guy had come up with an idea that we just did not understand
            well.’    The prosodic evidence and the evidence from relativization show that in the
double negative construction the aqi mini-clause is not a fully-fledged clause.
And the prosodic evidence and the restriction on the subject markers (only the
nonfuture and the sequential subject markers are possible) jointly show that aqi
is not a fully-fledged verb there. It is conceivable that what we see here is a
stage in Jespersen’s cycle (Jespersen 1917), whereby the simple negative con-
struction, which uses only the negative subject markers, was at some point in
history “strengthened” by the addition of a negative, aqi mini-clause, whose
clausal status is now being eroded. The fact that the double negative construc-
tion serves to express somewhat more emphatic negation but is not necessarily
emphatic is consistent with this scenario. And the less-than-full status of the
“topic” phrase before the aqi clause may be evidence of that position becoming
a subject position, as the originally bi-clausal structure is turning into a mono-
clausal one. And if indeed this kind of development is taking place, it has pro-
gressed further in the general negative construction than in the sequential one:
qe=aqi is further on its way to becoming reanalyzed as a unitary negation
marker than ka aqi is.","[798, 799, 800]"
"
17.6.     Negation and disabling conditionsNegation by means of the subject markers, whether in the simple or in the dou-
ble negative construction, neutralizes the future-nonfuture tense distinction.
There is, however, another type of negative construction that asserts that a po-
tential, contemplated, expected situation will not obtain, or should not obtain,
because of some disabling conditions. A state of affairs would obtain were it
not for some disabling conditions. The disabling conditions may but need not
be expressed. This type of negative construction is bi-clausal. The first clause is
the event one; it expresses the potential, contemplated, expected situation. The
event clause is grammatically positive. It must contain the irrealis marker sa
(section 18.2) and the subject marker must be sequential. The second clause is a
mini-clause that consists of the lexical negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the
case’ with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker qe. The basic
structure of this construction is shown schematically in (17-55):(17-55)     [… sa sequential.subject.marker verb ...] [qe aqi]

else is/are are apprehensive about a possible state of affairs and so a preventive
action is taken to (try to) avoid it. When there is no apprehension about a possi-
ble state of affairs, the timitive marker is not used. Instead, the purpose subor-
dinator fasi is used, which also functions to express positive purpose. The other
positive-purpose subordinator, uri, is not, by itself, used in this function; but
see further below. Negative-purpose clauses introduced by fasi are grammati-
cally negative. When the negative verb aqi is present in the purpose clause, its
subject marker is non-future.
    In the situation expressed in (33-73) the speaker wants to prevent a state of
affairs from obtaining, not because he fears it, but because he wants to play a
trick on others:

   The timitive marker ada can combine with the purpose markers fasi or uri,
even though the latter does not mark negative purpose by itself. Fasi or uri
come directly before ada. Fasi can occur with or without the object suffix, uri
only with the suffix. With these complex negative-purpose markers, it is ada,
not fasi or uri, that determines the grammatical polarity of the purpose clause
and the type of subject marker in the purpose clause: the clause is grammati-
cally positive and the subject marker can only be sequential.","[1213, 1214, 1215]"

19.2.1. Polar interrogativesPolar interrogatives express questions that can be answered by ‘yes’ or ‘no’,
although other answers are possible as well, such as ‘maybe’ or ‘I don’t know’.
However, ‘no’ answers are not defining of polar questions in Toqabaqita, be-
cause questions asked by means of open interrogatives also can be answered
with ‘no’. It is ‘yes’ and ‘maybe’ answers that are unique to polar questions.
(See section 19.4 for answers to questions.)

(simple) declarative sentences. The only difference is in the intonation. While
in declaratives there is normally a fall in intonation towards the end of the sen-
tence, in polar interrogatives there is a rise in intonation towards the end. The
sentence in (19-1) with falling intonation at the end is declarative, while struc-
turaly identical (19-2) with a rise in intonation at the end is interrogative:(19-1)     Qe             qako       naqa.
           3SG.NFUT be.cooked PRF
           ‘It [food] is cooked/done now.’(19-2)     Qe            qako       naqa?
           3SG.NFUT be.cooked PRF
           ‘Is it cooked/done now?’   Polar interrogatives can be elliptical sentence fragments:(19-3)     Qa-muqa?
           POSS-2SG.PERS
           ‘Yours?’ (Asking about food.)   A polar interrogative may contain a topicalized, fronted element:(19-4)     Wela baa ki,       qo          riki-da?
           child that PL      2SG.NFUT see-3PL.OBJ
           ‘The children, did you see them?’    A polar interrogative can be joined with a non-interrogative clause in a com-
plex sentence. In (19-5) the interrogative clause is coordinated with a declara-
tive clause :(19-5)     Nau ku            lae naqa, ma ni                    kamuluqa?
           1SG 1SG.NFUT go         PRF and PROFORE              2PL
           ‘I am going now, and (how about) you?’   And in (19-6) the interrogative clause forms the apodosis of a conditional
sentence:(19-6)     Mada      sa    mika          fula         qi     qusungadi,
           or        IRR   1PL(EXCL).SEQ arrive       LOC    tomorrow

             ‘If we come tomorrow, will that be all right? (lit.: will that only be
             good?)’ ‘If we came tomorrow, would that be good?’    Without any formal difference, positive polar interrogatives may express
neutral questions, where the speaker has no particular expectations about
whether the answer will be positive or negative, or they can express biased
questions, where the speaker has an expectation that the answer will be posi-
tive. The question expressed in (19-7) is neutral:(19-7)       Qo          riki-a        faela baa?
             2SG.NFUT see-3.OBJ file that
             ‘Have you seen the file [a tool]?’    On the other hand, the question expressed in (19-8) is biased. The question
is directed at a person who is getting ready to leave. The speaker expects the
answer to be positive and seeks confirmation:(19-8)       Qoki     lae naqa neri?
             2SG.FUT go     PRF NPAST.HERE
             ‘Are you going now?’    Sometimes the speaker is fully certain that the state of affairs is indeed such
and such and is seeking neither information nor confirmation. Rather a positive
polar interrogative serves a phatic communion function. Quite commonly, peo-
ple when seeing that a state of affairs is such and such will use a polar inter-
rogative as if they were inquiring about that state of affairs. Such interrogatives
typically serve as a way to initiate conversation or as a greeting. The sentence
in (19-9) was addressed to a man who was clearly making copra:(19-9)       Qo         kafara            nena?
             2SG.NFUT make.copra          NPAST.THERE
             ‘Are you making copra?’   And the interrogative in (19-10) was addressed to a person who was passing
by on his way down (towards the coast) and was intended as a greeting:(19-10)      Qo          sifo    nena?
             2SG.NFUT descend NPAST.THERE
             ‘Are you going down?’
                                                  19.2 Closed interrogatives   793    Positive polar interrogatives are also used when the speaker is not seeking
information from the addressee because he/she does not expect the addressee to
have the information. Rather, the speaker is contemplating the possibility that
such and such may be the case or is wondering whether such and such might be
the case. Such interrogatives function to express a relatively high degree of
uncertainty on the part of the speaker about a state of affairs. They employ the
element mada ‘or’, which elsewhere functions as a conjunction and also to
introduce the protases of conditional sentences, and they may also contain the
particle toqo ‘perhaps’, ‘probably’, ‘possibly’ (section 18.5.1). In (19-11) toqo
is present:(19-11)    Mada     e           sifo      toqo?
           or       3SG.NFUT descend perhaps
           ‘Did he perhaps go down [to the coast]?’   For a pair of examples without toqo see (18-60a) and (18-60b) in section
18.5.3.
   In contrast to positive polar interrogatives, negative polar interrogatives are
normally used to seek confirmation. A negative state of affairs is unexpected or
unusual, and the speaker wishes to have it confirmed that the situation is indeed
such and such. For example, on arriving at a household in the morning and not
seeing Ulufaalu (a man) around, the person surmises that Ulufaalu is still asleep
and asks:(19-12)    Ulufaalu     qe=aqi        si      tharaqi?
           Ulufaalu     3SG.NFUT=NEGV 3SG.NEG be.awake
           ‘Ulufaalu is not awake?’   By saying (19-13), the speaker expresses her surprise at not seeing Fiona
and the others around:(19-13)    Fiona kesi         fula     quu?
           Fiona    3PL.NEG arrive     ANTCONT
           ‘Haven’t Fiona ’n them arrived yet?’
19.2.2. Alternative interrogativesAlternative interrogatives express questions that “provide a list from which, the
speaker suggests, the right answer might be drawn” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:
179). In Toqabaqita, the alternatives in such a list are joined by means of the
conjunction mada ‘or’ (sections 11.2.2 and 28.4). There is normally a fall in
794    Interrogatives
intonation at the end of an alternative interrogative. The alternatives may be
clausal, where it is clauses that are joined by mada, or subclausal, where clause
constituents are joined rather than whole clauses. In the first example below the
alternatives are expressed in noun phrases:(19-14)    Qo         thathami-a alo mada kai?
           2SG.NFUT want-3.OBJ taro or        yam
           ‘Do you want the taro or the yam?’    As far as clausal alternatives are concerned, two main subtypes can be dis-
tinguished. In one, the clauses encode independent alternative propositions,
while in the other type the proposition of the second clause is a negation of the
proposition of the first clause. The subtype with independent alternatives is
illustrated in (19-15):(19-15)    Qo         raa mada        qoki      biinga        ba-muqa?
           2SG.NFUT work or           2SG.IPFV sleep          LIM-2SG.PERS
           ‘Did you work or were you just asleep?’   If the second alternative is a negation of the first one, that alternative is nor-
mally expressed only by means of the negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the
case’ (section 17.3):(19-16)    Faka ba=e              fula       mad=e            aqi?
           ship that=3SG.NFUT arrive         or=3SG.NFUT      not.be.so
           ‘Did the ship arrive or not?’   If the second alternative is assumed by the speaker to be obvious, it need not
be expressed at all, but the conjunction mada ‘or’ is still present. In fact, it is
the presence of mada that implies the existence of an alternative.","[843, 844, 845, 846, 847]"

AcknowledgementsFirst and foremost, my thanks go to Lawrence Foana’ota and Reuel Riianoa. I
first started working on the language with Lawrence in 1981, when he was a
student at the University of Auckland. And it was Lawrence who introduced me
to the late Reuel Riianoa of Laathalu Village, who became my primary lan-
guage consultant. Reuel was highly respected in the community for his knowl-
edge of the language and traditional concepts at a time when many of the tradi-
tional ways of life had disappeared or may disappear before long.
     A number of other people have contributed, over the years, to this grammar,
whether with texts or other kinds of data. Here I wish to thank Siufimama
(Lawrence’s late grandmother), John Kwanairara (Reuel’s late father), Adam
Ulufaalu Kwanairara (Reuel and his wife Rosina’s son), Reni, Olofia, Ellen
Kanatolea, Penuel Idusulia (the school principal at Malu’u, for general discus-
sions about the Toqabaqita language), Fred Saeni (with whom I worked on the
language during his visits to Auckland), Kado Kamanesi, Rosina Foialatha
(Reuel’s wife) and Liah Lifungangale (Lifuna) (Reuel and Rosina’s daughter)
for information about a disguised-speech variety known to some women, and to
Cathrine Saelifia (Adam Ulufaalu’s daughter) for demonstration of Pig-Latin
Toqabaqita used by children.
     My first period of field work in Toqabaqita was in December 1984–
February 1985. This was followed by five more periods, the last one being in
August–November 1999. During my stays in Laathalu Village I enjoyed the
hospitality and generosity of Reuel Riianoa and Rosina Foialatha’s extended
family, which includes the families of their son Adam Ulufaalu and his wife
Alice Edanamae, and their daughter Liah Lifungangale (Lifuna). On the coast,
at Malu’u, there was the always welcoming house of Reuel and Rosina’s other
daughter Joy Edarodo (Edata) and her husband Fred Matangani (Mata). On
various occasions I also enjoyed the company of Eddie Kanari, Kanatolea,
Saeni, David Rara, and many others. Lawrence Foana’ota was always a good
and helpful friend when I was in Honiara for brief periods of time.
     My work on the Toqabaqita language was supported by several grants from
the University of Auckland Research Fund, which are gratefully acknowledged.
     One round of revisions of the grammar was completed while I was an Hon-
orary Visiting Fellow at the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology at La
Trobe University, on research and study leave from the University of Auckland.
I wish to thank R.M.W. Dixon and Alexandra Aikhenvald for making it possi-
ble for me to spend six months, February–July 2006, at the Research Centre.

    The grammar took its final shape while I was a visitor in the Department of
Linguistics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, for
four months, August–December 2006, while still on research and study leave
from the University of Auckland. I thank Bernard Comrie for making my stay at
the Institute possible.
    I am indebted to Bernard Comrie for reading the near-final version and for
commenting in detail on matters of substance as well as style. The final product
has profited immensely from that. And I wish to thank Juliette Blevins for
comments on chapter 2.
    My thanks to Andrew Hardie for producing the maps and to Andreea
Calude for assistance with the final layout.
    Last but not least, I wish to thank the Walter de Gruyter Foundation for a
generous grant that made publication of this grammar possible.

Introduction
1.1.    The language and the peopleToqabaqita is an Austronesian language spoken at the north-western tip of the
island of Malaita in the Solomon Islands (maps 1.1 and 1.2). Tryon and Hack-
man (1983) consider Toqabaqita to be a dialect of a “North Malaitan” language,
together with Baeguu, Baelelea, and Fataleka (map 1.3 in section 1.3). They say
that Lau could also have been included as another dialect, but they have chosen
to consider it “a separate entity”, for reasons of “tradition” (Tryon and Hack-
man 1983: 27, fn 1). There are a number of other closely related languages
spoken on Malaita. To my knowledge, there is no conception among the Toqa-
baqita people of a single language of which Toqabaqita, Baeguu, Baelelea,
Fataleka, and Lau would be dialects. They do, of course, recognize the similari-
ties between Toqabaqita on the one hand and the other languages/dialects on
the other, just as they recognize the similarities between Toqabaqita and other
languages spoken on Malaita.
    Ethnologue gives the number of speakers of Toqabaqita as 12,572 in 1999
(Gordon 2005), which is a high number in the Solomons Islands context. (Eth-
nologue gives the name of the language as To’abaita.). Although bilingualism
in Toqabaqita and Solomon Islands Pijin is the norm (see chapter 40), it is To-
qabaqita that is the language of daily life. And although children are exposed to
Solomon Islands Pijin at an early age, it is Toqabaqita that they acquire as their
first language. At present the viability of the language is not under threat.
    The Toqabaqita people are primarily subsistence gardeners and practice
swidden agriculture. The main crops are sweet potatoes, taro, slippery cabbage
(Hibiscus manihot), bananas, sugar cane, and cassava. Yam and pana (Dio-
scorea esculenta) are of secondary importance as food crops. Tomatoes, spring
onions, snake beans, and a few other vegetables are also cultivated. The main
tree crops are coconuts, breadruit, canarium nuts, areca nuts, cutnuts (Barring-
tonia sp.), mangoes, pawpaws, guava, and Malay apples. Raising of chickens
and pigs is a common practice. Possums and flying foxes are hunted for meat.
There is some fishing, both in the sea and in the rivers and streams. Tinned tuna
and imported rice feature importantly in the diet of those who can readily afford
them. The gardens are usually located some walking distance from the villages,
2   Introduction
many of them on hill sides and mountain sides. Copra and cocoa are the
primary sources of cash.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

17.5.     Emphatic negationIn Toqabaqita, predicate negation can be made stronger, more emphatic in one
of several ways. The double negative construction can, but need not, carry rela-
tively light emphatic force; see (17-33a) and (17-33b) in the preceding section.
Commonly, negation is (further) strengthened by means of the postverbal asser-
tive/intensifying particle boqo (section 5.2.8). In (17-42) boqo is used in a sim-
ple negative construction, in (17-43) in a double negative construction, and in
(17-44) with aqi, which functions as a lexical verb there:
748   Negation

             what?      FOC=2SG.NFUT        want-3SG.OBJ          B: Qe           aqi        boqo.

          A: ‘What do you want?’
          B: ‘Nothing (at all).’ (‘There is nothing [that I want].’)(For negative answers to open questions see section 19.4.3.)
   Negation using the verb aqi as a lexical verb ‘not be so, not be the case’,
‘not exist’, ‘not be available’ can be made more emphatic by means of the per-
fect marker/intensifier naqa (sections 5.2.12 and 15.3). This strategy is not
available to the simple or the double negative constructions. Sometimes, naqa
does mark the perfect with aqi:(17-45)   Maala      b=e           tharu-fi               nau

           ‘I used to be rich (lit.: I used to see things), (but) this time no
           more/not at all.’ ‘I used to be a man who was rich; this time no
           more/not at all.’    But it is possible for naqa to express strong negation, without any sense of
the perfect. The three expressions in (17-47) can all function as answers to po-
lar interrogatives. The one in (a) is neutral, the one in (b) relatively emphatic,
and the one in (c) highly emphatic:(17-47)    a.     Qe           aqi.
                  3SG.NFUT     not.be.so

                  3SG.NFUT not.be.so        INTS
                  ‘Not at all.’ ‘No way.’   The situational demonstrative adverbs neri and nena, which are historically
fusions of the perfect-marker/intensifier naqa and the demonstratives qeri and
qena, respectively, can alo be used to make negation more emphatic (section
13.7)(17-48)    Qe           aqi          nena!
           3SG.NFUT not.be.so        NPAST.THERE
           ‘Not there!’ (Don’t look there.)    Negation by means of aqi as a lexical verb and by means of the double nega-
tive construction can be made emphatic by means of either the Class 1 transi-
tive verb dolo-fi ‘smooth, make smooth’ or the related intransitive proprietive
verb doodolo-qa ‘be smooth’. The first two examples show the two verbs in
their basic meanings:(17-49)    Nau kwai    dolo-fi-a       fasi qaaqae-na     matau

           ‘The path is smooth, level (without bumps).’   Both dolo-fi and doodolo-qa can be used in [verb verb] compounds (section
12.5) with aqi as a lexical verb. Aqi comes first. The negation is strongly em-
phatic.","[800, 801, 802, 803]"

             ‘Your father wants you not to go down to the sea.’   For another example see (29-56) further above.
   However, this way of negating desiderative constructions with complement
clauses is not common. Instead, it is normally the main clause that is negative,
grammatically and/or semantically. While it is true that ‘want that X not be the
case’ and ‘not want that X be the case’ are not fully synonymous, the latter type
of expression is the norm in Toqabaqita, while the former type is dispreferred.
There are two ways in which negation of a want or wish can be expressed in the
main clause. One is by negating thathami ‘want’, and the other is by using the
verb lalakwa ‘not want’, ‘not like’ in a grammatically positive clause. Unlike
thathami, lalakwa is an intransitive verb. It can take non-clausal oblique objects
that express that which is not liked. The oblique object is governed by the gen-
eral preposition qani.",[1057]

15.1.2.3.3.      Counterfactual near future in the past: avertiveThe two transitive verbs that function to signal open near future, karangi-a and
karafi-a, can also serve to express the fact that a state of affairs nearly obtained
in the past but did not. The event clause contains the irrealis marker sa (sec-
tions 18.2 and 18.3), which precedes the subject marker. If the event clase is
grammatically positive, the subject marker is future-tense. Negative event
clauses have a negative subject marker; see (15-33) further below. Apart from
the presence of the irrealis marker in the event clause, all the other grammatical
properties of the constructions are the same as those expressing open near fu-
ture.
   As discussed in section 5.1.7 there is a preverbal avertive particle ota, which
too signals that a state of affairs nearly obtained in the past but in the end did
690   Tense and aspect
not. However, this particle is used only rarely. Much more commonly it is the
near future construction with karangi-a (or karafi-a) in the higher clause and
the irrealis marker in the event clause that expresses the avertive meaning. As
with the open near future construction, the form karafi-a is used only rarely to
express the avertive meaning, karangi-a being the usual form. The intransitive
verbs kwaikarangi and kwaikarafi do not serve to express the avertive meaning.
   A few examples of sentences with the avertive meaning are given below.","[742, 743]"

Tense and aspect
The categories treated in this chapter are those of tense, aspect and the perfect,
the latter being neither purely a tense nor purely an aspect.","[709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, 729, 730]"

5.2.5.   Laqu additive, restitutiveThe particle laqu has two basic functions, additive and restitutive.18 In the addi-
tive function, laqu expresses the fact that a certain situation obtains, or, with
negation, does not obtain, in addition to some other situation, and/or that a cer-
tain participant is involved in the same situation or the same type of situation
that one or more other participants are involved in, in the same role. The exact
meaning of laqu in the additive function varies in different contexts, and there
are also some differences between positive and negative sentences. The addi-
tive function of laqu in positive sentences is discussed first.
    Frequently, although by no means always, the relevant situations are in tem-
poral sequence. Thus, laqu may be used to express the fact that a certain type of
situation occurs again, after a previous occurrence of the same kind of situation,
with exactly the same participant(s). Here one can speak of the same type of
situation being repeated.",[214]
"(39-23)     Wela naqi qe                thaofa       na ka           angi neqe.

            ‘It’s because the (lit.: this) child is hungry that he/she is crying.’   For an example of a focused clause in an open interrogative see (39-53) in
section 39.3.
   A presupposition clause may be negative:(39-24)     Teqe     keeroqa       bo=naqa n=e                      aqi

            3PL.NEG     die GENP        kill-person-DVN
            ‘It was only the two of them who did not die for a murder.’ ‘The two
            of them were the only ones not to die for a murder.’ (That is, unlike
            any other murderer they were spared the death penalty.)   Negation may be located in the focus part of the construction. In such cases
the focus constituent is a clause that consists of a subject noun phrase that en-
codes the participant in focus and the negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the
case’, which takes the third person singular nonfuture subject marker. This is
the same construction as the one used in the negative counterparts of positive
verbless sentences (section 27.2.5).",[1331]

           ‘They attempted to catch it [a bird] (lit.: they did in order to catch
           it), but (lit.: and) it was (too) difficult [they did not succeed].’
730    The sequential subject markers
    As discussed in section 16.3, one of the sequential subject markers is used in
clauses that are grammatically negative or that contain the verb aqi ‘not be so,
not be the case’, where the “sequential” clause makes it explicit that a potential
state of affairs did not, in fact, materialize.
    Different kinds of departure from the central function of the sequential sub-
ject markers are found in constructions where there is no grounding clause.
That is, such constructions can be used without any prior relevant discourse.
The sequential subject markers are obligatory in the expression of the timitive
mood (section 18.6):(16-24)    Ada qoko       mataqi.
           TIM 2SG.SEQ be.sick
           ‘You might be sick.’   Historically the timitive construction was biclausal, the present-day timitive
marker being originally a verb with the meanings ‘see’, ‘look out, watch out’
(Lichtenberk 1995).
   The sequential subject markers may be used in imperatives to soften their
force (section 20.2.3):(16-25)    Qoko     fanga   faqekwa.
           2SG.SEQ eat      be.small
           ‘Eat slowly/in small pieces.’ ‘You should eat slowly/in small
           pieces.’   And the sequential subject markers are also used in one type of negative
construction, where they occur together with the irrealis marker sa. The clause
is grammatically positive, and it comes before the clause that expresses the
negation. This construction signals that a potential situation will or should not
obtain because of some disabling conditions (section 17.6):(16-26)    Kini  ki sa         keka    raa qana oqola          baa    qi
           woman PL IRR        3PL.SEQ work GENP garden        that   LOC           qusungadi qe=aqi.
           tomorrow 3SG.NFUT=not.be.so
           ‘The women will not (be able to) work in the garden tomorrow.’
                                             16.3 Sequential clauses of negation   73116.3.     Sequential clauses of negationThe use of the sequential subject markers in clauses of negation represents yet
another kind of departure from the central function. “Clauses of negation” is a
cover term for clauses that are grammatically negative and for clauses that con-
tain the semantically negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the case’. (Aqi also
functions as part of a negative construction. For more detail on negation see
chapter 17.) And a “sequential clause of negation” is a clause of negation that
contain a sequential subject marker. The subject marker in a sequential clause
of negation must be the third person singular marker ka. Here the sequential
subject marker does not signal sequentiality of the onsets of situations. Rather,
sequential clauses of negation express unfulfilled expectation: an expected,
projected, attempted, desired situation did not materialize. The situation that
was expected, projected, attempted, or desired is expressed or implied in pre-
ceding discourse. Obviously, this is not sequentiality of the onsets of situations
in a strict sense, because the relevant situation did not obtain, although one
might argue that there is sequentiality in the sense that the expectation, etc. of a
situation was followed by the situation’s non-occurrence.
    Usually, a sequential clause of negation is joined to the preceding clause by
the conjunction ma ‘and’, although this is not required. For an example without
the conjunction see (16-31) further below. Sometimes, a clause that precedes a
sequential clause of negation does explicitly express the expected, projected,
attempted, or desired situation. In such cases the clause of negation may, but
need not, be in construction with a subsequent clause that expresses the non-
occurring situation. The latter is, in fact, more common; see (16-27), and (16-
28) and (16-29), respectively.(16-27)      … qe             thathami-a sa        kwai    kwala,       ma
               3SG.NFUT       want-3.OBJ IRR       1SG.FUT swear        and             ka      aqi kwasi      kwala.
             3SG.SEQ NEGV 1SG.NEG swear
             ‘… he wanted me to swear, but (lit.: and) I did not swear.’   More commonly, the situation is not encoded in a sequential clause of nega-

case’:(16-28)      Dani sa       kai       qaru, ma ka              aqi.

20.3.     Negative imperativesThere are two basic grammatical strategies to express negative imperatives, but
only one is normally used in present-day Toqabaqita; the other one is archaic.
The latter type of construction is referred to as “dehortative”.
852    Imperatives
20.3.1. Negative imperatives in present-day ToqabaqitaIn the present-day language, negative imperatives are expressed by means of
the same negative strategies used in declarative sentences, using the negative
subject markers (chapter 17). Both the simple and the double negative construc-
tions, the latter employing the negative verb aqi, occur in imperatives. The dou-
ble negative strategy is somewhat more emphatic than the simple strategy. The
next two examples illustrate the simple and the double constructions, respec-
tively:(20-38)    Qosi     waela qani nau.
           2SG.NEG laugh      GENP 1SG
           ‘Don’t laugh at me.’(20-39)    Qe=aqi             mosi         kwai-talami.
           3SG.NFUT=NEGV 2DU.NEG           LIP-interrupt
           ‘Don’t interrupt each other.’    Negative imperatives too can be used with a variety of illocutionary forces,
such as orders and commands (as in the two examples just above), advice,
warnings, requests, entreaties, dehortations, and dissuasions. They can be used
either to prevent a new state of affairs from coming about or to stop a state of
affairs that already exists or that has existed previously. In the latter type of
case, the verb is often reduplicated when the state of affairs has existed for a
relatively extended period of time or when it has occurred on multiple occa-
sions previously. (Reduplication of verbs serves to express the continu-
ative/iterative aspect; see section 15.2.3.) Like positive imperatives, negative
imperatives are most common with second-person subjects, but subjects of
other grammatical persons are possible as well. Examples (20-40) – (20-44)
have second-person subjects.","[904, 905]"

           ‘We did not speak to the two of them.’    The third-person singular negative subject marker consists only of the nega-
tive element si:(17-6)     ... tha        wela baa si         fula     naqa, ....

           ‘[The people looked and looked (around),] (but) the boy had not
           arrived, ....’   The negative marker si is glossed 3SG.NEG when it occurs in predicate nega-
tion, when the subject is third person (singular). And even though all of the
other negative subject markers are decomposable into two elements, for the
sake of simplicity they are treated as unanalyzed wholes in the examples; for
instance, misi 1PL(EXCL).NEG, rather than mi-si 1PL(EXCL)-NEG (see [17-5]
above).
   There is only one set of negative subject markers, and so the future-
nonfuture tense distinction found in grammatically positive clauses (section
736      Negation
15.1) is neutralized in negative clauses. The next pair of examples illustrates
the use of the negative subject markers in clauses with future-time reference
and past-time reference, respectively.","[788, 789]"

17.3.     The negative verbToqabaqita has a negative verb aqi, whose senses are ‘not be so, not be the
case’, ‘not exist’, and ‘not be available’. Aqi is a negative verb in two senses:
because of its meanings as a lexical verb, and because it also has a grammatical
function in the double negative construction, discussed in detail in section 17.4.
When it functions as a lexical verb, it is glossed according to its meaning: ‘not
be so’, ‘not be the case’, ‘not exist’, or ‘not be available’. When it is employed
in the grammatical function, it is glossed NEGV. In this section the focus is on
aqi as a lexical verb. Aqi has all the characteristics of verbs, with two excep-
tions: it is used only with third person singular subject markers, and, apart from
negative existential sentences (section 26.1.2.2), it does not take subject noun
phrases. A few examples of aqi as a lexical verb are given below.
    In (17-17) it occurs with two postverbal particles:(17-17)     A: Qo         siisiu      sui       naqa?
               2SG.NFUT bathe         COMPL     PRF

           A: ‘Have you bathed?’
           B: ‘Not yet.’   In (17-18) aqi has the third person singular future subject marker kai. The
future-tense subject marker is not grammatical when aqi occurs in the double
negative construction. In (17-18) the speaker is commenting on the occurrence
of full prayer services at the meetings of a church committee: one Sunday there
will be none, next Sunday there will be one:(17-18)    … teqe fa        Sandee kai     aqi,                 rua-na

           ‘… one Sunday there will be nothing, the following (lit.: second)
           Sunday he will tell Rongoomea to take the service ....’   In (17-19) aqi functions as a negative existential verb and has a subject noun
phrase (which follows the verb). Even though the subject is plural and human,
the subject marker must be singular:(17-19)    Qe           aqi            tai           toqa       qi     laa

subject marker (section 16.3):(17-20)    Dani sa       kai       qaru, ma ka              aqi.

grammatical marker of negation (see section 17.4).","[791, 792, 793]"

            ‘The knife I went for (The knife I went to get) was not there (lit.: at
            that place).’   For another example see the first clause of (26-3) in section 26.1.2.1. Nega-
tive locational sentences are not discussed any further. Rather, the focus is on
negative existential sentences.
                                    26.1 Locational and existential sentences   919   Negative existential sentences can express the fact that a certain type of
entity does not exist or is not available, normally at a certain location and at a
certain time, or that there is no entity of a certain type involved in a type of
state of affairs. Negative existential sentences also serve to express lack of pos-
session, which is grammatically treated as non-existence or non-availability
with respect to a potential possessor. This is discussed in section 26.2.1.2.
   Negative existential sentences employ the verb aqi ‘not exist’, ‘not be avail-
able’, also ‘not be so, not be the case’, which also serves to form negative con-
structions (sections 17.3 and 17.4). Negative existential sentences are unusual
in that the verb, with its subject marker, comes before the subject. This is one
of only two types of sentence where the verb precedes the subject (the other
being one type of interrogative locational sentences; see section 19.3.7) (and
also section 19.3.8). In negative existential sentences the subject marker must
be third person singular, nonfuture, future, or sequential (not negative or de-
horative). In addition, the verb aqi may be accompanied by one or more parti-
cles that belong in the verb complex (chapter 5). The basic structure of negative
existential sentences is shown in (26-17):(26-17)    [3sg.subject.marker aqi]                       [subject.NP ...]
                               not.exist/not.be.available   The subject noun phrase is non-referential. It encodes the type of entity
whose non-existence or non-availability is being expressed. The subject noun
phrase contains an indefinite quantifier, either ta ‘some’ or, less commonly, tai
‘some.PL’ (section 6.8.6). Tai is used only with count nouns and has a plural
value. Ta is used both with count nouns and with mass nouns. With count
nouns ta is unspecified as to number (singular or plural). The location or the
time characterized by the non-existence/non-availability of a type of entity may
be expressed after the subject noun phrase, but frequently it is not expressed
when it is determinable from context.
   In (26-18) – (26-22) the subject noun phrases contain ta.","[971, 972]"

ples (39-25) and (39-26).
   And a similar strategy is used to negate verbless fragments of clauses from

ted. The clause fragment functions as a topic; there is no subject phrase with
the negative verb.",[997]

ever, as will be seen in what follows, in almost all cases the grammatical ele-
ments used to form imperatives have other functions as well. These include the
subject markers: nonfuture, future, sequential, negative, dehortative, and, in two
cases, imperative. In the discussion that follows, a basic division is made be-
tween positive and negative imperatives, and within both categories various
subtypes are distinguished.
   Imperatives are normally directed at people, but they may be directed at
other entities as well. By using (20-3) the speaker is sicking a dog:

in section 20.2.3.","[895, 896]"
"
15.1.   The tenses15.1.1. IntroductionToqabaqita has a basic tense opposition of future vs. nonfuture, expressed by
the respective sets of subject-tense markers (section 4.8). Within both catego-
ries further distinctions can be made by means of additional elements and con-
structions. There is also a kind of past-in-the-past, which is not uniquely asso-
ciated with the nonfuture subject markers.
    The tenses are relative: the reference time may be the time of the speech act
or the time of another situation. If the reference time is other than the time of
speech, it is usually, although not always, signalled in another clause. The fu-
ture-tense subject markers are used when the situation time is after the time of
reference. The nonfuture-tense subject markers are used when the situation time
is before the time of reference both for states and for dynamic situations, and at
reference time for states. They are also used to express general states and gno-
mic situations. (They can also be used to express habitual states of affairs.) For
dynamic situations, when the situation time is at the time of reference, the event
is in progress.
    Semantically, the future-nonfuture contrast is rather complex, and there is
no simple correlation between the tenses as grammatical categories and situa-
tion times. Both sets of subject markers are used not only to mark tense but also
with other functions. The nonfuture markers are used to encode not only past
and present situations, but occasionally also future situations, especially situa-
tions that are imminent, about to obtain. And they are also used in positive im-
peratives. The future markers are used to encode future situations, but they also
function, jointly with another particle, to encode counterfactual past situations.
Furthermore, the same set of subject-tense markers that signals future tense is
also used to express the imperfective aspect: habitual and general events, and
events in progress, including such events in the past. That is, imperfectivity
678      Tense and aspect
overrides tense. However, events in progress, and habitual and general situa-
tions are also commonly encoded by the nonfuture subject markers. There are
circumstances where only the future/imperfective markers can occur, and there
are circumstances where only the nonfuture markers can, but there are also
circumstances where members of either set can be used. This is especially true
of the imperfective domain. Furthermore, the sequential subject markers (chap-
ter 16) too can be used with past-time or future-time reference.
    The grammatical future-nonfuture contrast holds only in positive clauses.
With one type of exception that, grammatically, does not concern the tenses,
the contrast is suspended in negative clauses, where the same set of negative
subject markers is used regardless of the time of a state of affairs.","[730, 731]"

           A: ‘What are you eating?’
           B: ‘Nothing.’ (Lit.: ‘There is not [any such thing].’)   That is, the same negative construction can be used to express a disagree-
type answer to an open question and as a negative answer to a polar question.
The only difference is that in responses to polar questions the negative verb has
the sense ‘not be so, not be the case’, while in responses to open questions the
negative verb has the negative existential sense ‘not exist’. (Negative existential
sentences are discussed 26.1.2.2.) The fact that in responses to open questions
the negative verb functions as an existential one can be seen from (19-175a),
where the verb occurs in the predicate position of a negative existential sen-
tence with an overt subject phrase. In (19-175b) only the verb occurs with the
subject marker and the assertive marker:(19-175)   a.     A: Taa       n=o                 thathami-a?

26.2.1.2.
   The subject noun phrase in a negative existential clause may contain a rela-
tive clause that characterizes the type of entity designated by the noun phrase.
However, relative clauses are used in this way only if the position relativized is
other than subject, as in (26-27):
922    Locational, existential, and possessive sentences

           hide     LOC LOCPRO
           ‘There is no place for us to hide.’ ‘There is no place where we
           can/will hide.’   A different construction is used when the position relativized is subject. The
verb of the relative clause has a negative subject marker, and the relative clause
marker na is not used. For example:(26-28)    Wane      qe       naunau.       Qe       aqi
           man       3SG.NFUT be.egocentric 3SG.NFUT not.exist           ta      thaari si            thathami-a.
           some    girl     3SG.NEG like-3SG.OBJ
           ‘The man is egocentric. There is no girl that likes him./No girl likes
           him.’(The verb naunau ‘be egocentric’ is a reduplication of the first person singular
pronoun nau.)
   Even though the relative clause has a negative subject marker, the modifica-
tion is positive, not negative. That is, in (26-28) the meaning is not ‘There is no
girl that does not like him.’ (The Toqabaqita counterpart of ‘There is no girl
that does not like him’ would be ‘Every girl/All girls like(s) him’.)
   As discussed in section 17.4, one of the negating strategies of Toqabaqita is
a double negative construction that employs a negative subject marker in the
event clause, and in addition there is a “mini-clause” that consists of the nega-
tive everb aqi with its own subject marker. Even though the event clause has a
negative subject marker, it does not negate the preceding negative mini-clause.
In a similar fashion, in the construction discussed here, even though the modi-
fying clause is grammatically negative, it does not have a negative force.
   This construction serves to express the non-existence, non-availability of a
certain type of participant in, or for, a certain type of situation.
   The sentences in (26-29) and (26-30) also illustrate this construction:(26-29)    Nia molo, qe=aqi              ta                     wane     si

            ‘Their country (is) a very clean country. There is no (other) country
           (that is) like it.’   If the subject of the relative clause is third person, the negative subject
marker in the relative clause must be singular, even if the subject of the nega-
tive existential clause is plural and even if it has human referents. In (26-31)
and (26-32) the subject phrases contain the plural quantifier tai; nevertheless,
the subject markers in the relative clauses are (and must be) singular.","[974, 975, 976]"
"   And in (2-90) the feminine person marker /n+/ has fused with the preceding
possessum noun and the personal suffix indexing the possessor has been elided:(2-90)     /6a+na-na        n+               a0ar+!+/
           mother-3.PERS PERSMKR             Fangariqi

                       mother:3.PERS=PERSMKR Fangariqi    The verbs /snr'-!'/ and /snr'-!a/ ‘think that, assume that’, with the detransi-
tivizing suffix /-!'/ ~ /-!a/, sometimes fuse with the following irrealis marker
/sa/ ~ /sn/ as /sn=sa/ or /sn=sn/: ‘think’:DETR=IRR. See, for example, (29-138)
and (29-139), respectively, in section 29.4.8.
    As mentioned above, the third person singular subject marker typically cliti-
cizes onto the following negative verb /a!+/ and it is the subject marker that
carries word-initial stress. There is no loss of phonological material here paral-
lel to what happens in fusion. However, because of the shift in stress, unlike
elsewhere when the subject marker cliticizes onto the following verb, this type
of phonological unity is marked in the rest of the grammar as involving fusion.

a reason to present them in phonemic or phonetic transcription. The correspon-
dences between the Toqabaqita phonemes and the orthographic symbols are

              w                  w    The set of orthographic symbols employed in this grammar departs from the
traditional orthography in the representation of the glottal stop and (partly) in
the representation of /0/. Present-day Toqabaqita writing conventions follow
those established by South Sea Evangelical Mission missionaries in their trans-
lation of the New Testament (Na alaofua falu: …. [1923 (1977)]. There the
symbol n is used to represent /0/, and the apostrophe to represent the glottal
stop. These days the diagraph ng is quite commonly used instead of n, espe-
cially by the younger people, and I have adopted ng here for typographical con-
venience.
    The glottal stop is rarely represented in the translation of the New Testament
and in the conventional orthography. I have decided to use the letter q to repre-
sent the glottal stop. The apostrophe is not a letter and does not distinguish
between the lower and the upper cases.4 By writing the glottal stop consistently,
I have already departed from the conventional orthography. (I have retained the
                                                   2.6 Orthographic conventions   41apostrophe in those proper names that are, at least sometimes, written in that
way, for example, Foana’ota [a personal name] and Malu’u [a place name].
However, the letter q is used here consistently in the name of the language, the
people and the area, Toqabaqita.) And there are other respects in which the way
the language is written here departs from conventional writing. In conventional
writing, double vowels are written as single, while sequences of two identical
vowel letters are used when in fact there is a glottal stop in between. And in
some cases what is analyzed in this grammar as a single although polymor-
phemic word is written as a sequence of words in conventional writing.
   Speakers of Toqabaqita that I have spoken to about the issue of the glottal
stop readily agree that there is a phonological difference between words that are
distinguished only by the presence and absence of a glottal stop; for example
/!ab7/ ‘blood’ and /ab7/ ‘be taboo, not allowed, forbidden’, ‘be sacred, holy (in
the Christian sense)’, although the two words are written in the same way. They
also agree that it would be useful for the difference to be reflected in writing.
They are aware of grammatical errors in the translation of the New Testament;
and even though copies of the translation are available, it is not much used in
church (one of the English versions being normally used).
   Some additional orthographic symbols are used here to represent sounds that
are not part of the Toqabaqita inventory of phonemes and that occur in code
mixing (section 40.3). These are listed in table 2.4.","[68, 69, 70]"

5.2.8.    Boqo assertive, intensifierIn declarative clauses/sentences, boqo serves to strongly assert, emphasize that
the state of affairs is indeed so or such and such. In its assertive function, boqo
is particularly frequent in negative clauses. Boqo is also used in non-declarative
clauses/sentences, where its function is better seen as intensifying. Most com-
monly, boqo has the predicate in its scope, but its scope may extend over the
whole clause.
    Boqo has a combining form bo=, used in combination with the perfect
marker/intensifier naqa and with the directionals.

18.5.3.      Mada ‘or’Less-than-full certainty on the part of the speaker about the factual status of a
proposition can be signalled by means of the form mada ‘or’, which also func-
tions as a disjunctive coordinator for phrases and sentences (sections 11.2.2 and
28.4, respectively), and together with the irrealis marker sa introduces the pro-
tases of conditional sentences (section 31.1). When it marks epistemic possibil-
ity, mada does not necessarily conjoin clauses or sentences. In this function,
mada can occur in a grammatically positive or a grammatically negative con-
struction, the latter being more common. The constructions with ‘or’ signal a
relatively low degree of certainty on the part of the speaker about the factual
status of the proposition. They function as suggestions concerning what a given
state of affairs might be.
    In a grammatically positive construction, mada occurs initially in the event
clause, unless a constituent has been topicalized (see [18-60b] further below):(18-59)      Mada kera         fula      naqa neri.
             or    3PL.NFUT arrive       PRF NPAST.HERE
             ‘They may have arrived already.’    Grammatically positive sentences with mada ‘or’ are sometimes given the
intonation of polar interrogatives, with a rise in the intonation at the end of the
sentence (section 19.2.1), which expresses a relatively high degree of uncer-
tainty. This is the case in (18-60a) and (18-60b). In (18-60b) the subject noun
phrase has been topicalized.(18-60)      a.   Mada      wela naqi e               mataqi?

                                       18.5 Other expressions of uncertainty   777   The negative construction is bi-clausal. The first clause is a mini-clause that
consists of mada, the verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the case’, and the third person
singular nonfuture subject marker qe. The second clause is the event clause,
which is grammatically positive. The basic structure of the construction is
shown in (18-61):(18-61)    [mada qe aqi] [event.clause]Mada ‘or’ and the subject marker qe frequently fuse together as mad=e.
   The sentence in (18-62), with the negative construction, is synonymous with
the sentence in (18-59) further above, without negation:(18-62)    Mad=e           aqi           kera          fula       naqa

           ‘They may have arrived already.’   The next two examples too contain the negative construction:(18-63)    Fanu e              qaru thaa-thato,  mad=e

           a sign of somebody about to die.)(18-64)    Fanga     naqi e              unuuna                 ba-na,

           ‘There is not plenty of food; we might miss out.’   The strategy using mada ‘or’ can be combined with the epistemic particle
toqo (section 18.5.1) in the event clause:(18-65)    A: Nau seqe-ku       e                   oo.

            A: ‘I feel cold to the bone.’ (Lit.: ‘I, my body feels very cold.’)
            B: ‘You may be getting sick.’   Usually it is the whole proposition expressed in the event clause that the
speaker is less than fully certain about. However, it is possible to make it ex-
plicit that it is only part of the proposition that the uncertainty relates to. In (18-
66) the mada strategy is combined with the particle toqo, and the latter has only
the focused first person singular pronoun in its scope. The speaker is uncertain
not about the event of the people whispering but about who or what they are
whispering about:(18-66)     Mad=e            aqi            nau   toqo     na  keki

            whispering about?’)  In (18-67) too the relevant part of the proposition (‘tomorrow’) is in focus.
Here toqo is not used.","[828, 829, 830, 831]"
"
18.5.     Other expressions of uncertaintyToqabaqita has several other means to express speaker’s less-than-full cer-
tainty, or indeed uncertainty, about the factual status of a proposition. Two of
these are clause-level particles, one involves the conjunction ‘or’ in positive or
negative clauses, and two are sentence pro-forms.",[824]

2.5.     Cliticization and fusionWith some exceptions, monosyllabic grammatical elements cliticize to the pre-
ceding word in the clause, if there is one.(2-69)      /na7 k7        6ana/                 [np7k7 6apn$a]
            1SG 1SG.NFUT be.hungry
            ‘I am hungry.’(2-70)      /la' s+    ma+/                       /lap's+ mp+/
            go PREC VENT
            ‘Come here now.’   Since such grammatical elements have no stress of their own, in some cases
such cliticization results in an additional syllable of the host being stressed in
order for sequences of more than two unstressed syllables next to each other
not to arise. In (2-71) the plural marker /k+/ has cliticized on the trisyllabic verb
/ba!+ta/. It is not only the first syllable of /ba!+ta/ that receives stress but the last
syllable as well:(2-71)      /bn6n ba!+ta        k+/         [mbnp&n mby!+tpk+]
            pig      be.big     PL
            ‘big pigs’    Compare (2-72), where the plural marker is not present, and it is only the
first syllable of /ba!+ta/ that carries stress:
34   Phonology
(2-72)     /bn6n ba!+ta/             [mbnp&n mbp!+t]
           pig       be.big
           ‘big pig’   If there is no preceding host available, because the grammatical element is
clause initial or because there is a pause between the grammatical element and
the preceding word, monosyllabic elements cliticize onto the following word.
However, even though they are word initial, they do not, with two types of ex-
ception, receive stress:(2-73)     /!'        la' +       mas7!7/        /!'lap' + mps7!7/
           3SG.NFUT go LOC bush
           ‘She went into the bush.’ (Euphemistically for ‘She went to the toi-
           let.’)(2-74)     /6a         7l7aal7 !'       7la              na!a/

           ‘Ulufaalu has arrived.’           [6a7y:l7$apa:l7 !'$7pl nap!a]   One type of exception concerns the combination of the third person singular
nonfuture subject marker /!'/ with the negative verb /a!+/. As mentioned in the
discussion of stress in section 2.3, here it is more common for the subject
marker, and not the first syllable of the verb, to carry stress,(2-75)     /!'         a!+/        [!'pp !+]
           3SG.NFUT not.be.so
           ‘No.’ (As an answer to a question.)See also (2-78) further below, and sections 17.3 and 17.4 for further discus-
sion.)
   The other type of exception concerns the general locative preposition /-!+/.
This preposition cliticizes to the following word when that word is grammati-
cal, unless it fuses with the preceding element (see further below for fusion),
and it is the preposition that carries word-initial stress:(2-76)     /al'-a         !+ a-na/                 [apl'a !+p$na]

netic form in (2-77) see further below.
   Neighbouring monosyllabic elements cliticize to each other:(2-78)     /na7 !'           a!+               ta        a !nta/
           1SG 3SG.NFUT not.be.available some            CLF areca.nut

           available.’)           [np7 !'p!+ tap$a !npta]   Cliticization is not indicated when examples are presented in the orthogra-
phy in the rest of the grammar; but see further below for the combination of the
third person singular subject marker /!'/ and the negative verb /a!+/.
    Cliticization as discussed above must be distinguished from what is here
referred to as “fusion” of two or sometimes even three words. In fusion, the two
or three lexical and/or grammatical words form one phonological word, and the
non-final component or components that make up a fused word lose some of
their phonological material at their ends, a segment, a syllable or even two syl-
lables. With one type of exception, the final component occurs in its full form.
The exception is grammatical elements that begin with a glottal stop: they lose
the glottal stop when fused to the preceding element. Words that have fused
together behave as single phonological words for the purposes of stress assign-
ment.
    Fusion is signalled in the grammar by means of an equal sign: =, including
when examples are presentend in the orthography.
    Fusion may involve grammatical words or lexical words. In some cases,
fusion is obligatory. Obligatory fusion involves certain combinations of gram-
matical words: when two or three such words occur next to each other, fusion
must take place. The reduced forms in which morphemes that obligatorily un-
dergo fusion occur are referred to in the grammar as the “combining” forms of
those morphemes. (A few morphemes must occur in their combining forms
when a bound morpheme is suffixed to them.)
    Fusion is obligatory when certain postverbal particles occur next to each
other. A few examples are given in (2-79). (For further discussion and exam-
ples see section 5.2.)

                    ASRT/INTS      PRF/INTS           VENT    [bnynamp+]    In other cases, fusion is optional and its frequence of occurrence varies. In
normal speech, the demonstrative /!er+/ ‘this’, ‘that’ and the plural marker /k+/
always fuse as /!'=k+/ ‘those’, ‘these’, although the unfused sequence /!er+/ /k+/
is accepted by speakers of the language as grammatical. The sequence of /k7la/
‘place’ and /na!+/ ‘this’ is normally realized as /k7=na!+/, rather than without
fusion.
    The general preposition /!ana/ more often than not fuses with consonant-
initial monosyllabic grammatical morphemes. It either has the form /!a=/, or
/!an=/. /!a=/ occurs regardless of the nature of the following consonant, while
/!an=/ occurs only before dental consonants:(2-80)     a.       /!ana/    /a/ /6atn/     /baa/     /!a=a 6atn baa/

                    ‘with some of the food’   The general preposition also frequently fuses, as /!an=/, with the numeral
/t'!'/ ‘one’:(2-81)     /!ana/   /t'!'/      /a/ /6atn/      /!an=t'!' a 6atn/

jor syntactic boundaries. In (2-82) the preposition /!+/ fuses with the andative
directional, which is part of the verb phrase, instead of cliticizing to the follow-
ing element, which is what often happens elsewhere (see the discussion of this
preposition further above in this section):(2-82)     /la' ka7 !+  sa-na/                    /la' ka=+ sa-na/
           go AND LOC ADJC-3SG.PERS
           ‘Go to him.’   The subject markers that begin with a glottal stop fuse with the preceding
word, and the glottal stop is deleted. These subject markers often fuse with the
relative-clause marker, the focus marker, and the complementizer /na/:(2-83)     a.     /na/        /!n/            /n=n/

           PERSMKR who?       FOC=3SG.NFUT            see-3SG.OBJ
           ‘Who did you see?’   Among the subject markers that begin with a glottal stop, it is the third per-
son singular nonfuture tense one that most frequently, and commonly, fuses
with the preceding element. In the next two examples it fuses, respectively,
with a nominalization in the subject position and with a demonstrative as the
last element of the subject phrase:(2-85)     /0ata-la-na             !'          ma7l+-!a/
           speak-NMLZ-3SG.PERS 3SG.NFUT be.on.left.side-PROP
           ‘He spoke in a clumsy, non-fluent, non-idiomatic way.’           with fusion: /0ata-la-n=' ma7l+-!a/
38   Phonology
   In (2-86) two geminate vowels disappear in fusion. This is the only type of
case when two syllables are deleted, although it is possible for only the last
vowel to be deleted.(2-86)     /dnn    !nrn        baa !'    makdpa/
           thing   be.many that 3SG.NFUT smell
           ‘Those many things smelled.’           with fusion: /dnn !nrn b=' makdpa/   And in (2-87) the third person nonfuture subject marker has fused with
/mada/, which is a conjunction ‘or’ and also serves to signal less than full cer-
tainty on the part of the speaker about the factual status of a proposition:(2-87)     /mada !'              mata!+/             /mad=' mata!+/
           or      3SG.NFUT be.sick
           ‘He might be sick.’ ‘Is he perhaps sick?’   Similarly, the general locative preposition /!+/ loses its glottal stop when it
fuses with the preceding element; see (2-77) and (2-82) further above, and (2-
89) further below.
   Fusion may take place when one word begins with a consonant that is iden-
tical to the consonant in the last syllable of the preceding word. The final vowel
of the first word is deleted and the two identical consonants are realized as one
long one:(2-88)     /maka kam+l+!a/
           father 1PL(EXCL)
           ‘our father(s)’           with fusion: /mak=kam+l+!a/        [mák:ym+l+p!]
                       father =1PL(EXCL)See examples (2-16a) – (2-16c) in section 2.2.1.
   Fusion may result in the elision of a morpheme. Only monosyllabic suffixes
are elided through fusion. The third person singular object suffixes /-a/ and
/-na/ and the third person singular personal suffix /-na/ may be elided when the
word they are part of fuses with the following word. Although the morpheme
has been elided, its notional presence is indicated in the morphemic glosses.
The gloss for the elided morpheme is joined to the preceding one by means of a
colon. In (2-89) the locative preposition /!+/ has fused with the preceding transi-
tive verb, and the object-indexing suffix has been elided:

           people [their ancestors] used to fight with (i.e. that they used as
           weapons) (and) that were lying (there) at the (old) house site.’   The verb teo ‘lie’, which has a nonfuture subject marker in (15-65), is a
nonstative verb, and as such can occur with an imperfective subject marker:(15-66)    Kafa qoe      baa    kai        teo   ba-na        qi

           ‘Your comb is lying just there, near you.’    See also (15-67) below.
    The distinction between the nonfuture and the future/imperfective categories
is neutralized in negation, where there is only one set of subject markers (table
4.5 in section 4.8). There is no explicit coding of the imperfective aspect in
negative clauses. In (15-67) the main clause contains the second person singular
negative subject marker in the main clause and the third person singular imper-
fective subject marker in the relative clause. In both cases it is habitual situa-
tions that are expressed. (For the use of prepositional phrases with the inessive
preposition laa in the direct-object position see section 10.2.3).","[753, 754, 755]"

27.2.5. Negative counterparts of grammatically positive verbless sentencesNegative counterparts of grammatically positive verbless sentences employ the
negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the case’ (sections 17.3). The verb always
has the third person singular nonfuture subject marker. Only lexical subjects
occur in this type of construction. In addition to the subject, there may be a
                                          27.2 Major verbless sentence types   943topic phrase. The basic structure of this type of construction is shown in (27-
34):(27-34)    (topic) [subject qe       aqi …]
                            3SG.NFUT not.be.the.case   The topic phrase corresponds to the subject of a grammatically positive
verbless sentence, and the subject phrase to the predicate. For example:(27-35)    [Raa     araqi           loo],  [raa         ta       wane
           work     mature.man      upward work         some     person           qe         aqi          neri], ....
           3SG.NFUT not.be.so NPAST.HERE
           ‘God’s work is not a person’s work, ….’ (Lit.: ‘The work of the ma-
           ture man up there, the work of a person is not the case, ….’)    In (27-36) the topic of the clause with the negative verb aqi is present (nga
doo neqe ‘this thing’), but that noun phrase is absent from the subject position
of the following verbless clause (nga doo qeeqeta neqe ‘a different thing’).","[995, 996]"

Notes39. Lichtenberk (1987) is an earlier study of the irrealis marker, which is superseded
    by the present analysis.
40. Quri can take nominalizations of other verbs as its subject, but in such cases it has
    the basic meaning ‘resemble, be like’, expressing comparison of equality, not epis-
    temic possibility. For example:     (i)    Wane naqi, ngata-la-na                 qe       quri-a        wane
            man this talk-NMLZ-3SG.PERS            3SG.NFUT be.like-3.OBJ man            qe         thaitoqome-qe doo, ….
            3SG.NFUT know-DETR            thing
            ‘This man talks like someone who knows a lot (but he doesn’t know a
            thing).” (Lit.: ‘This man, his talking is like a man who knows things, ….’)41. In Lichtenberk (1995) the term “avertive” was used. However, to avoid confusion
    with the avertive constructions (sections 5.1.7 and 15.1.2.3.3), the term “preven-
    tive” has been adopted here.
42. Compare the English expression shout somebody a drink/lunch, etc.
43. Lichtenberk (2007b) is an earlier study of constructions that serve to express recip-
    rocal and related meanings in Toqabaqita. That study was originally written in the
    mid-1990s and is superseded by the present work. However, the reference to it in
    section 21.1 with respect to the development of the earlier prefix *wai is valid.
44. Compare mala ‘quite, indeed, even’ in the closely related Kwara’ae language
    (Deck 1934: 89).
45. The terms “comparee”, “comparative predicate”, and “clause of comparison” have
    been adopted from Stassen (1985: 26).
46. In Lichtenberk (1991b) it was stated that bii and bia could not link clauses at all.
    At that time no examples of such use had been recorded.
        Bii and bia developed from an earlier transitive verb ‘accompany’ into a comi-
    tative preposition and then a noun-phrase conjunction, and their use to connect
    clauses is another step in a series of grammaticalization stages. As argued in
    Lichtenberk (1991a), one would not expect the clause-conjoining function to de-
    velop before the noun-phrase conjoining function.
47. Called “utterance” complement-taking verbs by Noonan.
48. When a Pijin word has more than one variant, the form given here is the one nor-
    mally used by Toqabaqita people when speaking Pijin.
49. The meanings ‘bathe (os.)’ and ‘bathe sb.’ are expressed in Pijin by suim and
    suimim, respectively. Their Toqabaqita equivalents are siisiu (intr.) and siu-fi
    (Class 1 tr.), respectively.

"   If a clause in the timitive mood is negative, the simple or the double negat-
ing constructions can be used (sections 17.2 and 17.4, respectively), except that
in the double negative construction the negative verb aqi must have the third
person singular sequential subject marker ka, not the nonfuture subject marker.
The basic structures of the negative timitive constructions are shown in (18-
73a) and (18-73b). In the former, the negative construction is of the simple
type; and in the latter it is of the double type. In (18-73b) the optional noun
phrase before the negative verb is a topic, coreferential with the subject marker

tion cannot have a subject phrase.(18-73)    a. ada (subject) negative.subject.marker verb …           b. ada (topic) [ka aqi] [negative.event.clause]    A clause in the timitive mood may be joined asyndetically to a preceding
clause, or it may form a sentence on its own, as in (18-74) and (18-75) respec-
tively, with positive timitive clauses:(18-74)    Bibi           faafi-a      kaufa ada    thauthau      ka
           weigh.down     CONF-3.OBJ mat     TIM    wind          3SG.SEQ           ngali-a.

           ‘Weigh down the mat (with something); the wind might take it.’
           ‘Weigh down the mat so that the wind may not take it.’ ‘Weigh
           down the mat lest the wind take it.’(18-75)    Ada keka      fanga     sui      naqa.
           TIM 3PL.SEQ eat         COMPL PRF
           ‘They may have finished eating.’   In the next two examples, the timitive clauses are negative. In (18-76) the
negative construction is of the double type, and in (18-77) of the simple type:(18-76)    Ada bii                naqi ka      aqi             si

           a. ‘The people may simply not have arrived.’
           b. ‘The people may simply not arrive.’   A clause in the timitive mood can contain the irrealis marker sa (section
18.2), but this is somewhat rare. The irrealis marker signals a relatively low
degree of likelihood of the situation obtaining.

           ‘They might just possibly come and kill us.’ ‘They might just possi-
           bly come to kill us.’ ‘They might just possibly come, in which case
           they would kill us.’   It is only the proposition expressed in the first clause in (18-78) that the
timitive and the irrealis markers have in their scope: the people’s coming. The
second event, their killing the speaker and his group is seen as something that
would (automatically) follow.
   However, it is possible for the scope of the timitive marker to extend beyond
the clause in which it occurs. In (18-79) it has not only its own clause in its
scope but also the following, disjunctively coordinated clause:(18-79)    Kaala wela qe=ki        bana na kera                alu-da.

           They [the children] stayed around Bariqi in case somebody might
           come and free him or so that he might not escape (by himself).’    The timitive mood expresses a kind of mixed modality (von Wright 1951):
two types of modality are present simultaneously. First, ada functions to ex-
press epistemic possibility: the situation expressed in a timitive clause is
viewed as a potential, possible one, rather than one whose occurrence is as-
serted. And second, ada is used only when the potential situation encoded in
the clause is undesirable. The undesirability of a situation may be signalled by
ada alone, or it may also be expressed in another clause. The timitive mood is
highly subjective: the speaker’s less-than-full certainty is combined with his or
her view of the potential situation as undesirable. Most commonly, the temporal
status of the proposition is future relative to the time of the speech act, as in
                                                        18.6 The timitive mood     783(18-74) further above and in many of the examples below, but it may be pre-
sent, as in (18-76) above, or past, as in (18-75).
   Ada is used in several types of contexts and functions: “fear”, “precaution-
ary”, and “apprehensional-epistemic”. These will now be discussed in turn;
however, as will be seen, the semantic/pragmatic distinctions between some of
the uses are not always clear-cut.","[833, 834, 835, 836]"

854       Imperatives
   And the negative imperative in (20-46) has a third-person subject:(20-46)       Qe         aqi     si      alilifeo.
              3SG.NFUT NEGV      3SG.NEG make.noise.RDP
              ‘He should not be making noise.’ ‘He must/should stop making
              noise.’(Alilifeo is a reduplicated form of alifeo ‘make noise’, but neither ali nor feo
exist in present-day Toqabaqita.)
20.3.2.       Archaic dehortativesToqabaqita has a complete set of dehortative subject markers, which are listed
in table 4.5 in section 4.8. With one exception, they are bimorphemic: the first
element encodes the subject and the second element the dehortation; for exam-
ple, qo-to 2SG-DEHORT. The third-person singular subject marker consists only
of the dehortative element ta. (In most of the subject markers the dehortative
element has the form ta; in two of them it has the form to.) For the sake of sim-
plicity, the dehortative subject markers are treated as unanalyzed wholes; for
example qoto 2SG.DEHORT.
    The dehortative subject markers are archaic. They are not used in the pre-
sent-day language. The only spontaneous instance of a dehortative recorded is
the one in (20-47) below. Today it is the negative-imperative constructions
discussed in the preceding section that are used to express dehortation. The
sentence in (20-47) is a customary moral saying (tarafulaa/tarufulaa). It is
used, even today, to people who get carried away and prematurely announce
success.","[906, 907]"

the negative clause is third person, but the negative subject marker in the rela-
tive clause is second person singular. The speaker addresses himself individu-
ally to each of the addressees.

also be achieved by means of a “relative purpose clause”, that is a purpose
clauses that functions as a relative clause modifying nouns (section 33.3.2):(26-34)    Mere           garo,             qe       aqi

   Negative existential sentences can be made emphatic by a second negative
existential clause. The additional negative existential clause is a mini-clause
that consists only of the verb aqi here with the sense ‘not be so, not be the
case’, which takes the third person singular sequential subject marker ka. This
clause follows the negative existential clause.","[976, 977]"

               A: ‘You, is your work (lit.: works) almost finished?’
               B: ‘No. Our work is not yet close to being finished.’   Being a verb, near-future marking karangi-a can take particles that occur in
the verb complex. In B’s response in (15-23) it is accompanied by the anterior-
continuing postverbal particle quu. See also (15-25) further below.
   Near-future marking karangi-a can be reduplicated to express the fact that
the temporal gap between the time of reference and the time of the future state
of affairs is relatively short, although such reduplication is not very common:(15-24)    Butete           naqi kaa-karangi-a        kai

form an utterance by itself, without a complement, event clause, and without a
subject marker. In (15-25) karangi-a occurs with the perfect marker:(15-25)    A: Qo            sui         naqa?
              2SG.NFUT      be.finished PRF           B: Karangi-a          naqa.
              be.near.to-3.OBJ PRF
           A: ‘Are you finished (with what you are doing)?’
           B: ‘Almost now.’ ‘Soon now.’    To summarize the evidence: Karangi-a has some verbal properties. First,
like Class 1 transitive verbs, it takes the object-indexing suffix -a (but so do the
verb-like prepositions). Second, it can have its own subject marker, which may
but need not be referential. When it is referential, there may be, in addition, a
subject noun phrase. Third, it is negated the way verbs are. And fourth, it may
be accompanied by particles that are part of the verb complex. On the other
hand, unlike verbs, karangi-a typically has no subject marker and no subject
argument. While near-future marking karangi-a has a preponderance of verbal
properties, it is not a typical verb.
    There are other forms used to signal near future, but all of them are much
less common than transitive karangi-a. First, karangi-a has a rare phonological
variant karafi-a, which too functions as a Class 1 transitive verb with the spatial
meaning ‘be near/close to’. There is also a rarely used intransitive verb karafi
‘be near/close’. Example (15-26) shows karafi-a in its function of marking near
future, as a variant of karangi-a:(15-26)    {Karangi-a          / karafi-a}             kai     dani
           be.near.to-3.OBJ    / be.near.to-3.OBJ      3SG.FUT be.daytime           naqa.
           PRF
           ‘It is almost daytime/daylight.’ ‘It will be daylight soon.’   Instead of the transitive forms karangi-a and karafi-a, near future can also
be expressed by the intransitive verbs kwaikarangi and kwaikarafi, which are
historically depatientive forms derived from the transitive forms karangi and
karafi, respectively. (Depatientive verbs are discussed in section 21.4.) How-
ever, since in the present-day language they do not function depatientively, they
are treated here as unanalyzed wholes. Both kwaikarangi and kwaikarafi are
also used as intransitive verbs with the spatial meaning ‘be near/close’ with the
688    Tense and aspect
implication of having become near, having approached. (The intransitive verbs
karangi and karafi have no such necessary implication.)
    Since kwaikarangi and kwaikarafi are intransitive verbs, the event clauses
are not their objects. The event clause is joined to the kwaikarangi or the kwai-
karafi clause paratactically. The kwaikarangi/kwaikarafi clause comes first.
Neither kwaikarangi nor kwaikarafi is common as a near-future marker, with
the latter one possible but not really used. Kwaikarangi (and, presumably,
kwaikarafi as well) seems more likely to occur with its own subject marker than
is the case with karangi-a (and karafi-a), but because of the paucity of exam-
ples of the former, it is difficult to be certain about this. When there is a subject
marker in the kwaikarangi/kwaikarafi clause, it is third-person singular, regard-
less of the subject of the event clause. That is, the subject marker does not in-
dex a participant. Kwaikarangi/kwaikarafi may be preceded by a noun phrase
that is a topic, not their subject. In (15-27) the topic is first person singular.
When there is a topic phrase before kwaikarangi/kwaikarafi, the third person
singular subject marker is normally present:(15-27)    Nau qe               {kwaikarangi / kwaikarafi} kwai
           1SG 3SG.NFUT         be.near      / be.near     1SG.FUT           mae           naqa

           ‘I will die soon.’ ‘I am near death.’ (Lit.: ‘I, it is near, I will die/will
           be dead.’)    When there is no topic phrase before kwaikarangi/kwaikarafi, there is usu-
ally no subject marker either:(15-28)    (Qe)       kwaikarangi wane kai         oli                 naqa.
           3SG.NFUT be.near            man 3SG.FUT return              PRF
           ‘The man will return soon.’   Kwaikarangi/kwaikarafi can be negated the way verbs are to signal that the
relevant state of affairs will not obtain in the near future (but at some more
distant future time). In (15-29) kwaikarangi occurs in B’s response.","[739, 740, 741]"

29.4.4. Desiderative verbsThe following verbs are included here: thathami ‘want’, ‘like’, ‘wish’; lalakwa
‘not want’, ‘not like’; manata-toqo ‘think of doing st.’, ‘want, intend to do st.’;
laloma ‘intend to do st.’; and toqe ‘desire, intend to do st.’ ‘have one’s mind set
on doing st.’.
   Thathami ‘want’, ‘like’, ‘wish’ is a Class 1 transitive verb and can take non-
clausal direct objects:(29-52)    Qo        thathami-a       alo mada            kai?
           2SG.NFUT want-3.OBJ        taro or             yam
           ‘Do you want the taro or the yam?’   Thathami takes complement clauses and nominalizations as its direct ob-
jects. There is also a preverbal desiderative particle thathami (section 29.5).
Complementation using clauses is discussed first. This strategy can be used
1002      Complement clauses
regardless of whether or not there is identity of subjects between the comple-
ment clause and the thathami clause. Grammatically positive complement
clauses must contain the appropriate future-tense or sequential subject marker,
the former being more common. Grammatically negative complement clauses
contain the appropriate negative subject marker. The first four examples show
constructions where the subjects in the complement clause and in the thathami
clause are different. In the first three the complement clauses are grammatically
positive.","[1054, 1055]"

rated in the latter type of compound (section 12.4.1).
    Quna phrases can also function as verb-phrase level constituents, as modifi-
ers of verbs in verb phrases, in which case they are (true) noun phrases, not
pseudo-verbs. See (4-1) in section 4.1 for their position in verb phrases. Their
status as phrase-level noun phrases rather than as pseudo-verbs is evidenced by
the fact that they can be separated from the preceding verb by intervening mate-
rial, which is not possible in [verb verb] compounds. In (4-231) the limiter par-
ticle intervenes:(4-231)    Kera         baa-baqe ba-da         quna qeri.

           (lit.: and) no way; his hair held fast.’ (The ogre’s hair was tied
           down.)   Noun phrases headed by quna ‘manner, way’ are the only type of noun
phrase other than those in the direct-object position that can function as verb-
phrase constituents. And they are also the only kind of noun phrase that can
function as a noun modifier; see section 6.14.
   Greetings and leave-taking formulae can be used as delocutive pseudo-
verbs. In (4-233) the leaving-taking formula ‘good night’ is used on its own, not
as a pseudo-verb:(4-233)    Rodo leqa.
           night be.good
           ‘Good night.’ (See section 27.3.2 for an extended use of this ex-
           pression.)
142    The verb phrase
    In (4-234), on the other hand, rodo leqa has been re-ranked. It occurs in a
parting formula with the second person singular sequential subject marker and
is followed by the andative directional:(4-234) Qoko       rodo leqa        kau.
        2SG.SEQ night be.good AND
        ‘Good night to you.’ (Lit.: ‘You be good-night off.’) (Said by the per-
         son leaving.)    Compare the leave-taking formula in (4-234) with a true verb and the anda-
tive directional:(4-235)    Qoko      too-too    kau.
           2SG.SEQ RDP-stay     AND
           (I am going). ‘Good bye.’ (Lit.: ‘You stay off.’) (Said by the person
           leaving.)   Other kinds of re-ranking into pseudo-verbs do occur, but they appear to be
more on-the-spot creations. For example, in (4-236) re-ranking has taken place
in the negative counterpart of a verbless ascriptive sentence (section 27.2.5).
The re-ranked phrase is teqe si lio ‘one mind’. The pseudo-verb has the plural
inclusive negative subject marker and is followed by the postverbal anterior-
continuing particle quu:(4-236)    Kulu     qe               aqi            kusi           teqe si

           ‘We are not (of) one mind yet.’ ‘We are not agreed yet.’   Compare the ascriptive sentence in (4-237), where re-ranking has not taken
place: there is no negative subject marker with the noun phrase toqa qi Toqa-
baqita ‘people at Toqabaqita’. That noun phrase functions as the subject of the
negative verb aqi ‘not be the case’, but it has been extraposed to the right. (See
section 27.2.5 for discussion of negative counterparts of grammatically positive
verbless sentences.)(4-237)    Nau ma        fulingana         maka        nau   ki,   kamiliqa

33.3.     Purpose clauses and purpose nominalizations33.3.1. IntroductionSeveral types of purpose construction need to be distinguished in Toqabaqita.
First, there are finite purpose clauses and purpose nominalizations. Second,
there are different markers used with (finite) purpose clauses, partly depending
on whether the purpose is positive or negative. And third, there are special pur-
pose constructions used with the verb lae ‘go’ in the preceding clause.
   Purpose clauses are discussed first. Regardless of the type of purpose-clause
construction, the order of the clauses is always iconic: main clause - purpose
clause. The same types of purpose clauses are used regardless of whether the
subjects of the main and the purpose clauses are different or identical.
   There are three markers used with purpose clauses: uri, fasi, and ada. Uri is
used only with positive-purpose clauses; fasi is used both with positive-purpose
clauses and with negative-purpose clause, but much less commonly with the
1146      Reason and purpose clauses
latter; and ada, which is the timitive marker (section 18.6), is used only to ex-
press negative purpose.","[1198, 1199]"

sists of the noun phrase rodo leqa ‘good night’ and a sequential subject marker.

for. When dooqanitaa or boro is present, it is the sequential, rather than the

clauses it is the double negative construction that is used (section 17.4), and it
is the negative verb aqi that has the (third person singular) sequential subject
marker if it is used. For a negative concessive clause see (32-5) above. A con-
cessive clause may be verbless; see (32-12) in section 32.2.
    Concessive clauses precede their main clauses, and typically there is a rise
in intonation at the end of a concessive clause, and there may also be a slight
pause between the concessive clause and the main clause.","[1181, 1182]"

            ‘This story is (lit.: goes) about a man and his wife and a child of
            theirs, a boy.’    When the possessive structure occurs inside a larger sentence, and only
then, the order of the possessive marker and the possessum noun phrase can be
reversed, with the possessive marker following the possessum noun phrase.
However, this is possible only if the overall possessive noun phrase expresses a
subset. The sentences in (26-50a) and (26-50b) below illustrate the alternative
orderings of the possessive marker and the possessum noun phrase. The subject
markers are singular, even though the subject phrases refer to two people. That
is, the two children are treated grammatically as forming a (sub)set rather than
being individuated (section 4.9). This could be the case, for example, if the
children died at (more or less) the same time.(26-50)     a.    Qa-da           roo wela e               mae.

                  ‘Two of their children died.’ (They had other children.)   Similarly, instead of (26-47) further above, where the order inside the pos-
sessive noun phrase is [qa-PERS NP], the order could be [NP qa-PERS]:(26-51)     Teqe qaba qa-na              qe           qoo.

26.2.1.2.   Grammatically negative existential possessive sentencesThere are several ways in which negative counterparts of grammatically posi-
tive existential possessive sentences can be formed. The basic one is a negative
existential sentence of the type discussed in section 26.1.2.2, with the negative
existential verb aqi ‘not exist’, ‘not be available’ and its third person singular
subject marker, occurring before the subject. The subject consists of a posses-
sive noun phrase of the type discussed in the preceding section. In (26-52) the
possessive noun phrase is in bold.

           (Lit.: ‘.... There is no more of ours food in the house so that we
           might eat it.’)   Just as in positive existential possessive sentences, the possessor may be
encoded not only by means of a personal suffix on the possessive marker, but
also be means of a topic noun phrase, as in (26-53) and (26-54):(26-53)    Wela qe             aqi          qa-n=ta                maka.

stepping in for them, by doing on their behalf what needs to be done’.)
   And just as in grammatically positive existential possessive sentences, the
possessive marker may be omitted if there is a topic noun phrase that encodes
the possessor:

           available.’)   And finally, again as in positive existential possessive sentences, there need
not be any expression of a possessor at all, the possessive relation being only
implied. Such sentences have the structure of ordinary negative existential sen-
tences (section 26.1.2.2).","[981, 982, 983, 984]"

5.1.8.   Tona, tofa, etc. restrictiveThere are a number of particles that signal that a situation is restricted only to
the event or state expressed in the clause, when some additional or different
states of affairs, performed by the same participant, are normally expected or
required. The particles are tona, toneqe, tootona, tootoneqe, tofa, tofe, tofeqe,
tootofa, tootofeqe. The reduplicated forms are used only in negative impera-
tives (although the other forms are possible there as well). Elsewhere, only tona
and tofa are used commonly, tona being more common than tofa. As mentioned
in section 20.3.1, in negative imperatives the verb is often reduplicated to ex-
press the meaning ‘stop doing such and such’. The use of the reduplicated re-
stricted-situation markers in negative imperatives suggests that all of these par-
ticles developed from erstwhile verbs. In addition to one of these preverbal
particles, the postverbal limiter ba- is often present as well.
    Tona and its variant toneqe also occur in noun phrases.
    The situations that are expected or required in addition to the one encoded in
a clause with a restricted-situation marker are usually not expressed, only im-

paying:(5-24)       Nau ku               {tofa        / tona}       lae     ba-kuqa

             ‘I went on the ship for free, without paying.’ (Lit. ‘I just went on the
             ship.’)  In (5-25) the implication is that the man came empty-handed, although one
would have expected him to bring something:(5-25)       Wane    qe         tona      lae            bo=ma-na.

             ‘Tne man came empty-handed.’   In (5-26) the implied message is that the addressee should do some work,
instead of just sitting idly around:(5-26)       Qo            {tofa / tofeqe        /   tona}         qono

             LIM-2SG.PERS      NPAST.HERE
             ‘You just sit here (doing nothing)!’    These particles can also signal that something is done for no obvious reason:
it is “just” done, without there being another situation that would serve as a
cause, purpose, rationale:(5-27)       Wane    e            tona      ila-ma-taqi  nau.

           ‘My good man, we did not expect you at all to just give us (things)
           (without being asked, without expecting anything in return).’   Example (5-29) shows the reduplicated variants in a negative imperative:(5-29)      Qosi    {tootona / tootoneqe         /     tootofa   /   tootofeqe}

5.2.     The postverbal particles5.2.1.   IntroductionThe postverbal particles occur before lexical direct objects, but after direct
objects that are realized by independent personal pronouns; see (4-1) in section
4.1. The postverbal particles are listed in table 5.2 in the order in which they
occur in a verb complex, which is also the order in which they are discussed.
Those that occupy the same position in the verb complex and so are mutually
exclusive are grouped together in the table under the same letter. More than one
postverbal particle can occur simultaneously in a verb phrase.
    Some of the particles have shorter, combining forms used when those parti-
cles fuse with a following particle. This kind of fusion between certain particles
is obligatory. Some of the combining forms are also used when a particle car-
ries a personal suffix. Only the full forms of the particles are listed in table 5.2.
The combining forms are presented in the respective sections.
    Most of the particles also occur in noun phrases, although not necessarily
with the same meaning. Those particles that also occur in noun phrases are
marked with an asterisk in the table.
    The first two pairs of examples show the positioning of the postverbal parti-
cles before lexical direct objects and after pronominal direct objects, respec-
tively. In the first pair the particle is the precedentive one, fasi:(5-30)     Kwai        qolo-si-a               fasi suli-ku.
           1SG.FUT straighten-TR-3.OBJ PREC back-1SG.PERS

19.4.2. Answers to alternative questionsThe default answer to an alternative question picks up one of the alternatives.
The interrogative sentence in (19-168) is a “complex” one (section 19.5), ex-
pressing a polar question (‘did you go?’) followed by an alternative one where
the second alternative is a negation of the first alternative (‘did you bring a
possum or not?’). The answer is an agree-type echo to the polar question and it
picks the negative alternative:(19-168)   A: Qoo, koqo        kera, kamaroqa     moro         laa-lae,
