"15. A. 1. “Yes” and “No”.
         There are no two words in Thai which can be considered as being the
equivalents of “Yes” and “No” in English and plain affirmative and negative
answers are given in a variety of ways depending on the way in which the
question is asked.
        This fact usually causes difficulty to the foreigner who is accustomed to
using “Yes” and “No” quite freely in a large number of sentences where they
are in many cases fairly redundant and are merely added for emphasis or to
smooth out the sentence and make it sound less abrupt.
          You have already seen some of the ways in which Thai people give
affirmative and negative answers and we will now bring all these and some
other forms together for comparison.
         (a) In Lesson 1 you had CHY “it is” and MY CHY “it is not”, but
             these two words are often used alone in sentences where in Eng-
             lish we would also add “Yes” or “No”.
                 BAHN NEE CHY MY                      Is this the house?

                  luhniu            As a general rule, if a question ends in CHY MY the best answer
            is either CHY or MY CHY
            Similarly, if the question ends in DY MY, the answer will generally
            be either D Y or MY DY.

(b) Another common way of rendering “Yes” or “No” in answering
    a question is merely to repeat the verb on its own for the
    affirmative or the verb preceded by the negative word MY for
    the negative.","[194, 195]"
"         A negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of
the verb or, in certain cases, after it. (See Lesson 7.)
        When a negative word qualifies an adjective it is usually placed between
the noun and the adjective (Example 21.)
         The future tense is indicated by putting the word JA “will”, “shall”
in front of the verb.
         In most cases questions in the future tense can be answered in the
present tense.
         The answer to a question is generally made as short as possible and in
many cases will consist only of a repetition of the verb in the case of an affirma-
tive answer, or the verb preceded by a negative word in the case of a negative
answer.
         The position of adverbs and adverbial clauses is variable. Generally the
adverb of time comes at the beginning of the sentence but we can add emphasis
to it by putting it at the end.
Other adverbs and adverbial clauses may go either at the beginning or end of
the sentence but the position of each particular one is usually fairly constant.
Adverbs or adverbial clauses seldom come in the middle of a sentence. For
instance;
       “Go to the market and buy some eggs”
would be rendered in Thai as,
         “Go buy some eggs at the market”
Interrogative adverbs and some adverbs of time such as “always”, “often”,
“soon” etc. are usually placed at the end of the sentence.",[31]

         Affirmative and interrogative sentences are of the same form; the
interrogative sentence being indicated by the addition of an interrogative word,
usually at the end of the sentence.","[18, 19]"
"  INQTIUUHU 11) m 111
 Note that in the negative sense the word DY is not omitted even if there is
 some other word in the sentence indicating past time. MY DY placed after
 the verb means “cannot”, “could not”, etc.",[88]

         which is quite straight forward, but if he did not go he will probably
         merely say.
         KRUP                  fl 5 LI               Yes, I did not go.

         flfll
        If you are not careful you can get very mixed up in these negative
questions and the unusual, though quite logical, reply, and it is better to try and
avoid them if possible.
The Thai themselves do not use the negative form of question very much in
conversation.
         These short answers given to questions in Thai sound rather abrupt
when translated into English but they are perfectly alright in Thai and you need
not be afraid to use them.
          Although we have tabulated the various forms of question and answer
above, there are no fixed rules as to when to use one or the other particular
form and in fact most of them are fairly interchangeable. Once you have had a
little practice in the language you will have no difficulty in forming an appro-
priate reply to any question.","[196, 197]"

YAH (0 tH ) is the prohibition “Don’t” and cannot be used in any other

"This word NIT is a diminutive but is seldom met with except as above in
combination with other words, or as a first name for men or women.
NOY is also used at the end of an imperative sentence to soften down the
command. It then has almost the meaning of “please”.
(See Lesson 21)
SATAHNEE (cftlTU) corresponds closely with the English word “station”
and is used in the same way except that it does not make a verb similar to
“stationed at”. It may be used for a “railway station”, “police station”,
“petrol station” etc.
LER-Y (iclfj) is a word which is often added onto the end of a negative
sentence to give emphasis and can fairly well be translated as “at all” in most
cases.

In the negative, ORK occurs in a number of very idiomatic expressions where
there is the rather vague implication of something “going out” from the

The negative however should be noted.,[187]

   strictly be more correct to use PEN.

   you will meet in Lesson 18.",[89]

        REU PLOW is mostly used in questions to which you do not know
what the answer is likely to be, i.e. questions in which in English we might end
with the words “or not?”

         REU is similar to MY but is not such a good word to use generally. In
many cases it does not sound very “polite”. It is however the general word to
use in the following circumstances.

        ihmwiUinnvno
As you will see if you examine these questions, it can be broadly said that if you
use REU it usually implies that you expect an affirmative answer.
        Negative questions of the form of (b) above are not very common in
Thai and should be avoided for the present as the answer is rather tricky. See
Examples 8 and 12 Para 5 of this lesson.","[101, 102]"

Thai a negative question such as :

MY SABAI similarly means “worried”, “unhappy” or “not well”.

OW ( 101 ) “to want” can only be used in the sense of wanting something
concrete, and cannot be used in the sense of “I want to buy.”
It is not such a polite word as DTORNG GAHN although you will hear it
used a lot colloquially particularily in the negative.","[55, 56]"

            sentence that KRUP and KA have this meaning of “yes”.

                                          CONVERSATION8. A. 1. Question Words.
        In Lesson 1. A. we saw that an interrogative sentence was formed by
adding the interrogative word MY or the words CHY MY at the end of the
sentence.
REU and REU PLOW are two other words which are used in a similar manner.
The distinction between the various forms of question is not easy to make and
in many cases they are used alternatively but we can set out the following broad
principles as a general guide.
         MY is generally used for a direct question concerning something in
the present or future.
MY cannot be used in a negative question or in questions where the pronouns
14, 1414 or 11414 are written or implied.
In these cases we must use CHY MY (preferably) or else REU.
        KOON CHORP LEN TENNIT MY                            Do you like playing tennis?

         TiiiifitimlilimiirmlMu
               9
          CHY MY corresponds fairly closely to “is it”, “are you” “does it”
etc. and is used in sentences where we could use “is it?” in English even though
in English we would probably use a rather different form of construction.","[100, 101]"

7. A. 1. The Past Tense; the words DY                 (Ifl)      and PEN       (llJU)
  (a) The Past Tense is usually expressed by using the simple present together
  with an adverb of time to denote the past.
  “Yesterday I went”              =      “Yesterday I go”
  “He came just now”              =      “Just now he come”
  In cases where no adverb of time is used, the past tense may be indicated by
  putting the word DY in front of the verb.
  In this case DY is best translated as “did”.
  CHUN D Y A H N NUNGSEU                         I read (did read) the book.
   a/ In 9S f        0/   4
  HU IflQlUMlNfiQ
  This form of the past tense is not very often used except with a few words
  such as “to receive”, “to hear” etc. which almost invariably take DY in front
  of them in the past tense.
  In other cases the Thai generally prefer to convert the simple past tense into
  the past perfect and say “I have come”, “I have eaten”, etc. (See Lesson 9)
  (b) If the word DY is placed after the verb it means “can”.
  CHUN A H N NUNGSEU DY                          I can read the book.
   o/   !                 In 3>
  HUQlUMU'lffQ m
  (c) When DY is used with the negative word MY the meaning is again depen-
  dent on the position with relation to the verb.
  MY D Y placed in front of the verb means “did not” and this construction
  is very widely used.
 CHUN MY DY PY                                   I did not go.

"  KA. There are actually two words (written KA in the transliteration) used
  by women, and though there is little difference between them in normal
  conversation it is appropriate to draw attention to them at this stage. *
  KA ( f l £ ) pronounced in the high tone is normally used in questions

  be translated as “is”.",[34]

   POP (VI11) “to meet” is generally used for “seeing” or “meeting” someone
   but not for “going to meet” someone, for which you must use another word
   RUP (See Lesson 7. A.4.)
   OW ( 101 ) means “to take” but it is not often used alone in this sense. It is
   usually combined with MAH “to come” or PY “to go” to mean “bring” or
   “take away”.
   Double verbs of this nature are a common feature of the Thai language and
   will be dealt with more fully in Lesson 20.
   You should note however that where there is an object it is placed between
   the two verbs. (Examples 3, 15.)
   OW also means “want”. You will come across this meaning later.
   TEENY (lil'MU) “anywhere” is the same word as you have had in
   Lesson 1 meaning “where”.
   You are not likely to find that these two different meanings cause you much
   trouble.
   ARY ( 0 1 )This word generally means “what?” except in negative sen-
   tences where it usually has the meaning of “anything”.
          TUM ARY                    What are you doing?

  DY m “can” is the same word as DY m “to get” (Lesson 7)
  PEU-AN (LH014) MIT (jJPll) Both these words mean “friend, companion”.
  PEU-AN is the most commonly used in conversation but you will come
  across MIT occasionally in reading and in certain compounded words.
  SEUNG ( CB4) T E E (Vl)Both these words mean “who”, “which” but
  TEE is in more general use than SEUNG which is rather more formal.
  Note that TEE is the same word as TEE which you had in Lesson 1 meaning
  “at”. See also Lessons 3 & 20

"The word MY expressed in a rising tone at the end of a sentence is probably
the most common interrogative word and denotes a question. Its use is analo-
gous to that of the English word “NG?” as often used by Latin peoples at the
end of a sentence in English to donate a question.",[19]
"KON CHY (Bllln) is the general term for “a servant” and really means
“an employed person”.
BOY (110 tl) derived from the English word is usually applied to the head
servant of a European household irrespective of sex.
The Thai themselves do not generally use this word when referring to their
servants. They call them by name.
BUNTOOK ( l l l l V i n ) means “to load” and a “lorry” is therefore “a loaded
vehicle”
NIW (Ul) means “a finger” but it is also the word to use for “an inch”.
JEUNG (IN) is a conjunction and is best translated as “so”, “therefore” or
“then”.
Note however that it comes after the subject of the substantival clause and
not in between the two clauses as in English.

RUKSAH               means “to look after” or “to care for” in the sense of
“looking after a sick person” or “caring for” a moral principle.

REU-ANG (L'SB'l ) means “a story” but in most cases it is better translated
as “about” “referring to” etc.

"         In colloquial Thai and also to a lesser extent in writing it is customary
to leave out pronouns, prepositions and other words provided that the intention
of the sentence appears to be otherwise adequately expressed. On the other
hand words which have little or no meaning in the context in which they are
being used and are often quite incapable of translation are frequently inserted
in a sentence to make it sound more complete and euphonious.",[19]

Note.
     When referring to numbers of things or people a special form of construction is used
   which includes a ""Classifier"" or Designatory Particle"".
      For instance you cannot say "" H e has three houses"" but must say "" H e has houses
   three buildings"".
      The question of Classifiers and their usage will be dealt with in Lesson 1 0 and until
   you reach there you had better be a little careful with numbers.",[46]
"         Most idiomatic expressions can be used in a number of ways and an
exact translation is frequently impossible so it is well to be careful about using
them. When you meet them study the context in which they occurred, as an
idiom used out of context sounds strange to a native speaker of the language and
is not always understood.",[421]
"24. A. 1. (a.) ( n )        The letter f) GOR standing alone or in combination with certain other
words occurs frequently in both conversation and writing and can be translated
in a wide variety of ways, depending on just how it occurs, and in some cases
cannot be translated at all.
   Some of the more common usages are as follows.   (i) It frequently introduces the main sentence after a conditional clause and
   in this case comes after the subject of the main sentence if any.",[326]
"         Although as has already been mentioned, the best way to learn the
tones correctly is to imitate a natural Thai speaker, you will undoubtedly come
across new words in your reading from time to time or want to look up words
in a Thai dictionary and it is necessary to understand the manner in which tones
are indicated in the written language.
The tone rules are undoubtedly complicated because of the number of factors
involved and it may be mentioned here that a considerable number of otherwise
quite well educated Thai people do not know them.
Although it will be some time before you can be expected to apply these rules
correctly and rapidly, this is an appropriate stage at which to introduce them.",[140]
"   But lest this lead you into the common error of thinking that Thai
   is a very inadequate language in all respects, we would commend
   for your consideration the words of that Thai scholar and fluent
   English speaker M.L. Pin Malakul, sometime Minister of Educa-
   tion, who, in opening a conference of S.E. Asia Language experts
   in Bangkok, said;    “Although we have always been grateful for the use of English
    as means of communication with people of other nations, each
    of us at some time or other must have found it inadequate as a
    medium of expression when it comes to discussing elusive and
    abstract subjects such as art, literature, refigion and philosophy.”",[270]
"19. A. 1. The Passive Voice.
         (a). The passive voice is generally used in Thai only when referring to
events of a violent or unpleasant nature.
When used it is denoted by the addition of the word TOOK (fl fl) in front
of the verb.
(This is the same word TOOK as you have already had meaning “cheap'
Lesson 10)
         MAH TOOK JEP DOY ROT                             The dog was hurt by the

The second example given above is the more common form of construction
and should be particularly noted, as the word order :
                         Subject-TOOK-Agent-Verb.
is a little confusing at first and difficult to get used to.
         (b). In most other cases the passive voice is treated by turning the
sentence round to put the verb in the active voice.",[247]

The effective use of this particle can only be learned by constant practice and
by listenting to natural Thai speakers.","[327, 328]"
"          In most languages there are several ways of expressing the same idea
and the one adopted depends to a large extent on the speaker’s education, ex-
perience and social environment ; so if your teacher tells you to say something
differently from what we have put down here, make a note of it and follow him.
Similarly when working through the exercises, if you find your way of rendering
an English sentence in Thai is not the same as that given in the book, it does
not follow that you are wrong. Check with your teacher and see if your version
is acceptable or not, and if not, why not. If it is you will gain confidence; if it is
not you will have learned something new about the finer points of Thai con-
structions and the meaning of Thai words.
          As far as possible a colloquial style has been adopted throughout the
exercises both in English and Thai versions, even in some cases at the expense
of strict academic accuracy, since the aim of this book is to teach you to speak
Thai rather than to become a Thai scholar. Such lapses as there are from formal
accuracy however are all common usage and are readily acceptable anywhere
but in Court circles.
         The system of transliteration from Thai into English is an unorthodox
one which is certain to be criticised by professional linguists but it has been
carefully worked out, is consistent and, we believe, is suitable for the purposes
of this book and appropriate to the class of people we expect to use it.
          The lessons are intended to cover a six months course taking one lesson
per week and doing it thoroughly. Experience has shown that one lesson can
easily be mastered in a week although if time is available it may be advantageous
to treat the discussion on tones and the tone exercises in Parts B as separate
lessons.
          No attempt has been made to deal with specific activities such as
“Going to the Post Office”, “Seeing a Doctor” etc. as in Bangkok today none
of these activities require a knowledge of Thai at all and even in the country,
until you are comparatively fluent in the language you will probably do far
better to stick to English and speak it slowly. If a Thai can speak English at
all he is generally better at it than you will be at Thai for quite a while.
        The Extended Vocabulary at the end of the book contains all the words
from the various sectional vocabularies with a number of additional ones making
about 1200 in all which, if you know them all, will get you along fairly well
under most circumstances.
         There are many Thai and foreigners in Bangkok who are far more
qualified to write a book such as this than we are. The need is there; but as none
of them have shown any sign of doing so, we make no apologies for stepping
into the field.","[6, 7]"

        In general the Thai language does not always distinguish very clearly
between the various forms of Past and Perfect Tenses.
          Although as we have seen in Lesson 7. the use of DY in front of the
verb indicates the past tense, this is usually omitted in conversation and fre-
quently in writing and the adverb of time is relied upon to show that the action
is in the past.
          Another way of showing the past tense is to use the word MEU-A
“when” and GORN “before” separated by an adverb of time and in this con-
struction these two words can generally be translated as “ago”.

         When referring to movement from one place to another and back both

"Most verbs of motion such as SONG “to send”, KUP “to drive” PAH “to
accompany”, LONG ‘“to descend”, KEUN “to ascend” etc. are followed by
MAH or PY in this way to indicate the direction of motion relative to some
reference position.
         As an extension of the above idea, we can, in certain cases, use these
two words to denote direction in time as well as in space.
The distinction here involves the rather philosophical concept of time moving
up from the past to a given instant and then receding into the future.
This is well illustrated in the use of the two expressions DTOR MAH and
DTOR PY, both of which mean “then”, “later on etc.”
When talking about events that have happened we used DTOR MAH because
the sequence of events referred to was considered as moving towards the
speaker’s present, but when talking of the future we use DTOR PY because to
events are considered as receding from the speaker’s present position in time.
The following two idioms will perhaps help to make this concept clearer.",[257]

  The colloquial forms of any language are difficult to explain to any foreigner
  and it is unlikely that you will be able to use these words as a Thai would
  until you become very accustomed to the language. The proper usage will
  come gradually by listening to Thai speakers, but in the meantime you can
  get along quite well without trying to use them unless you are sure. Don’t
  just use them unless you are fairly sure the usage is correct; they sound rather
  silly if used wrongly. We mention them here because you will hear them used
  and meet them in reading and should recognise the usage.","[345, 346]"

"20. A. 1. Double verbs.
         Double verbs are very common in the Thai language and are used in
two different ways.
(a) Two verbs may be used together to denote two separate actions as in
English.
In this case each verb carries its own full meaning and the English translation
can generally be considered as having the word “and” understood between
the two verbs.
        If there is an object it comes after the verbs in the normal manner.
        POM JA PY YEE-AM NAI LEK                   I will go and visit Nai Lek.

         uiiiauviuiaomini
(b) A number of verbs in Thai can be used as adverbs to qualify or amplify
the meaning of the verbs.
In this case the two verbs are often called primary and secondary verbs, and
though this is a convenient nomenclature it is probably better in many cases to
think of the second verb as an adverb.
When two verbs are used in this manner, the object, if any, usually comes
between the primary and secondary or adverbial verb.
Some of the more common secondary verbs are set out below.
MAH “come” and PY “go”
          These two words are frequently used as secondary verbs or adverbs
and you have had some examples of this usage already. They indicate that the
action specified by the primary verb takes place toward or away from the speaker
or sortie other designated or implied position.
         For instance; if you ring up your soft drink suppliers you can say:
         SONG SODAH KOO-AT YY_MAH                   Send two dozen large soda
         TEE BAHN POM SORNG LO                      (come) to my house.

shades of meaning and see very little difference between “I buy a tomato” and
“I am buying a tomato”. As long as their meaning gets across they are prepared
to take considerable liberties with formal grammar.

examples and the expressions must be considered as a whole.

in which the implication is by no means entirely clear, but these are idiomatic
expressions and should be learned as such.

                                LESSON 1. A.
                               CONVERSATION1. A. 1. (a). The Tones.
        The Thai language is a “Tonal Language” which means that a word
may have two or more distinct and quite unrelated meanings depending on the
tone in which it is pronounced.
        Altogether there are five tones but there is no single word which is
pronounced in all five although there are a number which may be pronounced
in two or three and carry a different meaning in each.
          Most newcomers to the language are rather appalled at the apparent
difficulty of the tones but they are not as hard as is generally imagined even for
people with no musical ear.
         A great many words in common use take only one tone and even where
a word has two or three tones, each with a different meaning, in most cases the
word you intend to use will be made clear by the context provided you get the
construction of the sentence right even though your tone may not be quite
correct.
         The five tones are;
          (i). The High Tone.
               This, is a uniform tone pitched well above the level of the
               speaker’s normal voice and is similar to the tone used in Eng-
                lish to denote alarm.
                          e.g. “keep away”
               It is indicated in the vocabularies by “h”                A bird                NOK                      h     un
                To love               RUK                      h     ■fn
               Small                  LEK                      h     tan
          (ii). The Rising Tone.
                This as the name implies has a rising inflection and is something
                like the tone used in English to denote surprise or a question
                          e.g. “Are you going home now ?”
                It is indicated in the vocabularies by “r”.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

13. A. 1. (b). The use of WAH d (11)         The word WAH may be used either as a verb or as a conjuction.
         As a verb it means “to say” but its use in this sense is mainly confined
to certain types of sentences reporting speech.
        KOW POOT WAH A-RY                              What does he say?
         iirmenios'h
             <u         KOW BORK MEE KAOU                             He says that the news says. . . .
         WAH
         luiusnuu'iiii
         The most common use of WAH is as a conjunction introducing a
substantival clause after verbs of mental action such as “believe”, “think”,
“understand”, “promise”, “know”, “say”, “feel”, etc.
In this usage it is similar to the English conjunctions “that”, “whether”, “if” in
similar constructions.
         POM KOWJY WAH KOW PY                            I understand that he has gone to
         SEERAHCHA LAAW.                                 Sriracha (already).
               31 q   1       In |   <4         31
         h u mini         inn hJfnmuim
         POM MY SAHP WAH KOW                             I don’t know whether he will
         JA MAH REU MY                                   come or not.
            111 I         T                -K   In T
         n u liivmimiimzinMia                   In
         KOON SAHP MY WAH KOW                            Do you know where he lives?
         YOO TEENY                                       (Do you know that he lives

                                                         where?)
WAH is also used in other cases where it acts more as a comma than anything
else and cannot be translated at all.
You will come across this usage later.","[170, 171]"

RUP-PRATAHN is frequently abbreviated into THAN and sometimes also
into RUP.

GIN (flu) is also used in another rather peculiar way meaning “to eat”
or “to use up” time.","[163, 164]"
