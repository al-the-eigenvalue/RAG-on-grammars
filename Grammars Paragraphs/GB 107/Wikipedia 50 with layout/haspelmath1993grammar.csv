they are used very rarely and it is unclear whether and how their meaning
differs from the simple Present form. Only Continuative Imperfective
forms (Ja-zma, ama-zma)     are reasonably common.
   The forms that do not exist are replaced by the corresponding forms of
the verb Jtun 'become, be'.","[156, 157]"

13.3.9. The particle SaThis sentence-initial particle is used in Imperative and Hortative sentences.
It is of course originally the same word as the Imperative of atun 'come', Sa
(9.3.1.3.).(637) a. Sa qhu-qh               wuna! (X89:31)

As has been noted in 9.3.5., verbs are negated by the negative suffix -6 or by
the negative prefix tA-. Such verbal negation is the normal sentence nega-
tion in Lezgian, e.g.(638) a. Xürünwi-jr.i          ada-waj       meslät-ar          qaöu-zwa.          (HQ89:14)

       Ά : Did you say 'thank you' to her? B: No.'
Answers to negative questions are treated as in English, i.e. wa? 'no' con-
firms the negation of the questioned sentence (cf. 1179), and e£ 'yes' contra-
dicts the negative assumption of the question (cf. 1180).",[440]

awa 'be in', gwa 'be near', gala 'be behind', kwa 'be under', ala 'be on'
(with their Continuative variants ama, guma, galama, kuma, alama, cf.
17.6.6.) are defective in that they allow the formation of only a subset of in-
flectional verb forms. They have a Present tense, a Past tense formed with -j,
a participle also formed with -j, a suffixal negative form -6, and a converb
form in -z. Thus, they lack an Imperfective, a Future, and all the forms
based on the Aorist stem and the Masdar stem. The copulas also diverge
from regular verb forms in that they have suffixal negation even in their
converb and their participle. The participial suffix in negated copulas is -ir,
making the Past tense completely homonymous with the participle (in reg-
ular verbs, only the non-negated Past tense is homonymous with the corre-
sponding participle).
   The standard copula ja has some suppletive forms, the other copulas are
inflected like awa.","[155, 156]"

1.3.1. User-friendly featuresAn attempt has been made to make this grammar maximally user-friendly
even for readers who need a particular piece of information (e.g. for a cross-
linguistic investigation) and have no time to wade through the whole
grammar. This grammar has the following features that make it easy to use
as a reference work:
   (A) Morpheme-by-morpheme glosses with brackets marking subordinate
clauses for better readability (cf. 1.3.5.).
   (B) A detailed subject index which, in addition to normal entries referring
to places in the book, contains entries that do not occur elsewhere in the
book. Such entries are names of grammatical phenomena that do not occur
in the language. Thus, looking up the subject index suffices to find out that
Lezgian has no passive, no dual, no tones. There are of course no negative
statements about these categories in the grammar, and since the mere ab-
sence of a category in the index proves nothing, the negative information in
the index might be useful.
   (C) An index to the example sentences. Since the examples (most of
which were taken from original Lezgian texts) usually show other interest-
ing phenomena in addition to the point which they illustrate in the particu-
lar place in the text, such an index makes a lot of additional information
available. By looking up the number of an example in the index, the reader
                                          1.3. A user's guide to this grammar   9can find up to twenty more examples elsewhere in the grammar that illus-
trate the same point.
   (D) A more or less complete bibliography of scholarly works on Lezgian.
Most of these are not mentioned in the text, but a reader who is interested
in further information or different points of view is given the chance to
look them up. The subject index simultaneously serves as an index to the
bibliography. This step was taken so as not to clutter the text with references
that few readers will find useful because most of the publications are diffi-
cult to get outside of Daghestan.
   (E) An index to the grammatical morphemes of Lezgian.","[28, 29]"

128   9. Verbal inflectionThe following generalizations can be made:
   (i) The suffix -j/-ir derives Past forms from non-Past indicative forms (-j
in affirmative forms, -ir in forms following the negative suffix -£).
   (ii) Participles are derived from non-Past indicative forms by means of
the suffix -j. (These participles are identical to the corresponding Past forms
when they are not negated.) An exception is the Aorist participle, which is
derived directly from the Aorist stem.
   (iii) Indicative forms are negated by the suffix -6 following the aspect suf-
fix (and preceding the past suffix -ir), whereas non-finite forms and the
Hortative and the Optative are negated with a iV-prefix or periphrastically.
   In the following subsections (9.3.1.-5.) each verb form is described in more
detail.","[147, 148]"

guzwa 'gives', guzwa-c 'does not give'). Non-finite and non-indicative verb
forms are negated by prefixal negation. In most verbs this means pe-
riphrastic negation involving the negative auxiliary t-awun 'not do', but a
closed set of verbs take the negative prefix t(A)- (a high vowel occurs only in
tü-t'ü-n 'not to eatO themselves, i.e. they have inflectional, not periphrastic,
prefixal negation. According to Moor (1985), this closed class consists of the
following members:  Masdar            negated Masdar

  tun               ta-tun (ti-ta-, ta-tu-)       'leave, admit, cause'   Note that all of these verbs are strong, and most of them are monosyl-
labic. Even the disyllabic verbs in this class have disyllabic negated forms
(the root vowel is deleted in taxwun, talhun, tewhin).
   This class is becoming smaller and smaller. Already now, Moor notes,
most of the above verbs can alternatively be negated periphrastically, except
for awun and xun. And in Uslar (1896:§258, §274), the class is much larger.
Uslar lists about sixty verbs with inflectional prefixal negation, including
weak and polysyllabic verbs, e.g.:  aqwazun           t-aqwazun                     'stop'
  eqiigun           t-eqiigun                     'scold'
  rasun             ta-rasun                      'repair'   Periphrastic prefixal negative forms are formed with the auxiliary t-
awun 'not do' and the Periphrasis form. The Periphrasis form is always
identical to the base in weak verbs, and in strong verbs it is most commonly
identical to the Masdar, e.g.:

11.6.4. Negative indefinite pronounsThese are derived from the specific indefinite pronouns by means of a
phrase-final suffix -ni ('also, even'):(464) a. sa ...-ni          'no' (e.g. sa gaf-ni 'no word')
      b. sa kas-ni          'nobody7

      f. sana-ni            'nowhere'
      etc. (cf. Table 5 in 11.3.)   The two pronouns sa kas-ni 'nobody' and sa zat'-ni 'nothing' have a
suppletive oblique stem: The oblique cases of sa kasni are based on sa-d-a-
'one (substantivized)', and the oblique cases of sa zat'ni are based on the
stem kün-i-:(465) Abs.   sa kasni 'nobody7                 sa zat'ni    'nothing'

                                      Copular clauses
When the predicative phrase in a copular clause is a noun phrase or an ad-
jective phrase, the standard copula ja (Past tir, negative tu$, Past negative
tuS-ir, cf. 9.5.1.) is used. When the predicative phrase is an adverbial expres-
sion, one of the local copulas is used (awa 'be in', kwa 'be under', etc.). The
verb £un 'become, be' may also be used in either function.","[330, 331]"

language as the Archaic Preterit. It is occasionally used, especially in
negative form and with the verb ±un 'be', e.g.(358) a. Wi           rik'-e           ixtin gaf-ar         ze-t (N88:87)

"
9.5.2. Verbs lacking a Masdar and Aorist stemThe verbs k'an- 'want', kiö'e- 'afraid', Hi- 'know7, t'a- 'hurt' share two impor-
tant features: (a) they lack a Masdar and an Aorist stem, and (b) their Future
in -da has a non-future, non-habitual, present state meaning. At least k'an-
and kiö'e- seem to be adjectival in origin. See 8.1.3.1. for related phenomena
in adjectives.9.5.2.1. k'an- 'love, need, want'. The verb k'an- is based on the adjective k'an
'dear'. It has three verbal forms: an Imperfective k'anzawa,          a Future
k'anda    (as well as all forms that are based on these, i.e. participles, Past
forms, negative forms), and a converb k'anz (negative ta-k'anz).            The
Future has present state meaning. Thus, (292a) and (292b) mean more or
less the same, and a third way to express the same meaning is by means of
the adjective k'an plus the standard copula (292c).      a. Za-z   wun        k'an-zawa.

"   But when a constituent that is in contrastive focus is negated, the nega-
tive particle wa? is postposed after the constituent. (This particle also serves
as a negative pro-sentence in answers to polar questions, cf. 23.1.5.) The con-
trasting constituent is usually also present in the sentence.(639) a. Am           wa-laj-ni          za-laj   aslu            k'walax          ja,

not present, verbal negation is used. In (640), the context makes it clear that
the addressees were indeed invited, but also for some other reason.","[265, 266]"

23.5. Question particles
Several discourse particles are often used in questions (for other discourse
particles, see 13.3.). They express various nuances of the tone of the question
and are hard to translate into English. Like other discourse particles, they are
either sentence-initial or follow the verb directly.
23.5.1. bes
This sentence-initial particle is perhaps the most common question particle.
This particle often conveys the speaker's expectation of a negative answer.(1207) a. Bes xalq'.di-n nexir ni                       xil-da? (Du85,3:115)

"   The formation of ordinary and free-choice indefinites is quite straight-
forward: The indefiniteness-marking particle jat'ani /Aajit'ani follows the
corresponding interrogative pro-form, and in the case of the ordinary indef-
inite, the numeral sa 'one' in addition precedes the interrogative. The for-
mation of specific and negative indefinites is somewhat more complicated,
cf. 11.6.3.-4.
   When indefinites function as nominal modifiers, the particle iajit'ani
follows the whole noun phrase, while the particle jat'ani tends to follow
the interrogative immediately:(454) a. hi         waxt.und-a        Aajit'ani

         one which       INDEF       confusion
         'some sort of confusion'    The formal makeup of the two indefiniteness-markers jat'ani               and
itajit'ani is quite transparent: They are concessive conditional verb forms of
the standard copula ja and the verb £un 'be', respectively. Thus, the mean-
ing of wui itajit'ani is literally 'whoever it may be' (cf. 21.8.4., and the quite
analogous French form qui que ce soit).",[214]
"  In elliptical answers, negative pro-forms may occur without an accompa-
nying verbal negation.(468) a. A: Axpa dax.di               wuö            luhu-da? B: Zat'-ni. (Du85,3:79)

Discourse particles express various subtle pragmatic meanings that are hard
to render in a language like English which makes little use of discourse par-
ticles. In this section, some example sentences are also accompanied by
German translations where a German equivalent is available.
   Lezgian discourse particles generally occupy a marginal position in the
sentence. Most of them are sentence-final (after the finite verb), but a few
are sentence-initial.

course particles, are treated in 23.5.","[260, 261]"
"5.5. Vowel Harmony alternations
Because of the phonotactic restrictions of Vowel Harmony (cf. 4.4.), native
prefixes and stress-bearing suffixes show alternations. In affixes with a low
vowel, /a/ and /e/ alternate according to Palatal Vowel Harmony (in one case,
the Inelative suffix -äjl-aj, /aj a n d /ae/ alternate); in affixes with a high
vowel, /u/, l'\l, and lyl alternate according to Palatal and Labial Vowel
Harmony. The alternating affixes are most conveniently represented in
their archiphonemic form. In this work, A is used to represent a low vowel
(/a/ or /e/), and U is used to represent a high vowel (/u/, /i/, or lyl).
     Thus:        A        =      /a/     in the environment of     /a, u/
                           =      /e/     in the environment of     /e, i, y, ae/
                  U        =      /u/     in the environment of     /a, u/
                           =      Ν       in the environment of     /e, i (ae)/
                           =      lyl     in the environment of      lylThe following are examples of harmonic affixes:

"9.3.2.6. Prohibitive. Its suffix is -mir both in strong verbs and in weak verbs.
This suffix -mir has been grammaticized from the old Prohibitive of awun
'do', mijir 'don't do' (the current form is iji-mir). This form, m-iji-r, consists
of an old Prohibitive prefix m-, the Imperfective stem -iji-, and the particip-
ial suffix -r (9.10.4.). Topuria (1959:118) cites similar archaic or dialectal
forms like me-qwa-r 'don't go', ma-gu-r 'don't give'.
   Like the Imperative, the Prohibitive cannot be negated, and one could in
fact regard the Prohibitive simply as the negative form of the Imperative.
This is not done here because it would complicate the description of the
morphology considerably (the Imperative is derived from the Masdar stem,
while the Prohibitive is derived from the Imperfective stem).

16.1. Grammatical relations: the notion of subject
16.1.1. Subject propertiesNotions such as subject, direct object, indirect object, etc. (i.e. grammatical
relations, or syntactic functions) are generally used sparingly in this book.
The reason is that their use is not as straightforward in role-dominated lan-
guages like Lezgian as it is in reference-dominated languages like English.
There are very few generalizations that need to be stated over grammatical
relations.
   The subject is the most important grammatical relation, and I will mostly
be concerned with this notion in this section. There is some evidence, albeit
rather slight, that a notion of subject is needed in Lezgian grammar. The ar-
guments that have subject status are the Absolutive argument of intransi-
tive verbs, the Ergative argument of transitive verbs, and the Dative argu-
ment in the Affective Construction.
   However, most of the properties that often serve to identify subjects in
other languages do not uniquely identify subjects in Lezgian. Following
Keenan (1976), we can divide subject properties into coding properties and
behavioral properties. Coding properties are case marking, subject-verb
agreement, word order and the like. Case marking would of course identify
the Absolutive argument both of intransitive and of transitive sentences as
the subject. However, case marking is not normally considered sufficient
evidence for grammatical relations in languages with ergative case marking.
Subject-verb agreement is lacking in Lezgian. There is some weak evidence
from word order that Ergative agents and Dative experiencers are both sub-
jects, because both precede the Absolutive argument in the unmarked order:(799) Alfija.di     maqala       kxe-na.
      Alfija(ERG)   article     write      'Alfija wrote an article.'

ments and clausal adjuncts, cf. 16.2.), this is very weak evidence. It is just as
possible that the true word order generalization is a strong tendency for
topics to precede non-topics, and for agents and experiencers to be topics.
   Behavioral properties have to do with behavior in valence-changing (or
relation-changing) operations and with behavior in various types of coref-
erential constructions. Valence-changing operations do not yield any criteria
in Lezgian, because the only valence-changing verbal categories, the
Causative and the Anticausative (cf. 10.1.-2.), affect only one type of argu-
ment (Causatives are formed only from intransitive verbs, Anticausatives
only from transitive verbs). It is only in coreferential constructions that we
begin to get some clearer evidence for a notion of subject in Lezgian, as dis-
cussed in the following two sections.","[314, 315]"

13.2.3. The particles mad 'still' and hele 'already'The meaning of the particle mad is quite similar to that of German noch.
When preceding an indefinite noun phrase, mad is translated as '(yet) an-
other' or 'else'.(617) a. Sa ara.di-laj              za-z      mad      qiigür-r.i-n           k'we xizan          zaga-na.

lowing forms exist:(462) a. sa kas      'someone, a certain person'
      b. sa zat'     'something, a certain thing'
      c. sadra       'once'  These indefinites are used when the identity of the referent is known to
the speaker but if the speaker chooses not to tell the hearer. Thus, (463a) is
preferred to (463b) if the speaker knows the person she met.(463) a. Naq'      tam-a        za-l     sa   kas   diiSilS      ±a-na.

1.3.2. Structure of the grammarThe structure of this grammar follows the well-established traditional order:
phonology — morphology — syntax — texts. This ensures that the amount
of information that is presupposed in a given section but comes later in the
book is minimized.
   The morphological chapters deal with the form and the meaning of the
grammatical items of the language. For inflectional categories, the inflection
as a whole is first described, followed by a description of the meanings of the
individual inflectional categories. For derivational categories, form and
meaning are treated together.
   While the morphology takes the analytical perspective (from form to
function), the syntax takes the synthetic perspective (from function to form),
with chapter topics such as coordination, relative clauses, complement
clauses, adverbial clauses, coreference, questions, and comparison. All these
are taken as functional notions. For example, participial relative clauses and
correlative relative clauses show no formal similarities, but they are treated
together in Ch. 19 because of their similar function.
   Thus, this grammar to some extent fulfills the theoretical requirement to
present the grammatical information both from an analytical and from a
synthetic perspective (von der Gabelentz 1901, Lehmann 1980). For example,
the functions of the Dative case are described twice: First from an analytical
perspective in the chapter on nominal inflection (7.2.2.4.); and then from a
synthetic perspective in the sections on verbal valence (15.3.2., 15.4.1.), on
adjectival valence (14.5.1.1.), and on spatial and temporal adverbials
(16.3.1.1., 16.3.2.1.). Similarly, the functions of the Aorist converb are de-
scribed twice: First in the chapter on verbal inflection (9.9.4.), and then in
the sections on adverbial clauses (21.1.) and on complement clauses (20.6.1.-
2.). Sometimes only cross-references are made to avoid unnecessary repeti-
tions.
   However, this grammar, too, has an analytical bias. Not everything is de-
scribed from a synthetic point of view. For example, there is no function-to-
form treatment of tense meanings, or of number meanings. For such phe-
nomena, the form-to-function description must suffice.
10   1. Introduction1.3.3. Grammatical terminologyAnother feature that contributes to the user-friendliness of this grammar is
the avoidence of opaque grammatical category labels such as ""5th Elative
case"" or ""3rd Past tense"". Instead, grammatical labels with some mnemonic
descriptive content have been chosen, such as ""Superelative case"" and ""Past
Perfect"". This meant that traditional Lezgian terminology had to be aban-
doned in several cases. However, the traditional terminology itself is by no
means uniform. For example, Gajdarov's (1987a) textbook differs substan-
tially from the earlier standard accounts of Talibov & GadZiev (1966) and
Mejlanova (1967). Other works such as Zirkov (1941) and Moor (1985) use
still different terms.
   The following table is a comparative list of the most important terms that
are most widespread in Russian-language studies of Lezgian and of the ter-
minology used in this grammar (my terminology is closest to Mel'iuk's
1988a).","[29, 30]"

"16.2. Word order at the clause levelLike noun-phrase-internal and adjective-phrase-internal word order,
clause-level word order is generally head-final, i.e. verb-final. However,
whereas head-final word order is obligatory in noun phrases and adjective
phrases, verb-final order is only the preferred word order in independent
sentences. Alternative orders are possible, especially in the colloquial lan-
guage. The order of the other major constituents of the clause (arguments
and adjuncts) is quite free, although there is a strong tendency for the sub-
ject to precede the other arguments.

"  However, the Periphrasis form of strong verbs that is combined with an
Imperfective-stem verb form of the auxiliary is optionally based on the
Imperfective stem itself. Since the Imperfective Periphrasis form also takes
the suffix -n, it is formally identical to the affirmative Hortative. Thus we
have, e.g.  raxun tawun 'not talking'                             t'iin tawun  'not eating'
  raxan tijiz  'not to talk'                            nen tijiz    'not to eaf
  raxun tawuna 'not having talked'                      t'iin tawuna 'not having eaten'This Periphrasis form with the same distribution (i.e., weak verbs: = base;
strong verbs: = Masdar, optionally = Hortative for Imperfective-stem forms)
is also used in the following two cases:
   (A) In periphrastic Repetitives (cf. 10.4.): ksun qhuwun             'sleeping again'               kilig qhuwuraj       'let...look again'
 ksan qHjida             'will sleep again'             kilig qHjizwa        'is looking again'
 ksun qhuwuna            'fell asleep again'            kilig qhuwuna        'looked again'   (B) When the verb base is focused and marked by the focus marker -ni
'also' (cf. 18.1.2.).

1.3.4. Example sentencesThis grammar provides rich exemplification of the covered material. The
purpose of this is to make as many data as possible available to the reader.
The reader may not agree with the proposed analyses and some of the de-
scriptions may turn out to be incorrect, but the example sentences will not
lose their usefulness.
   Each example that has a number of its own illustrates a point in the de-
scription. When several examples illustrate the same point, they are distin-
guished by the letters (a), (b), (c), etc.
   The overwhelming majority of example sentences were taken from orig-
inal Lezgian texts and thus represent ""real language"". The source of each
text example is indicated in parentheses following the example. (The num-
ber following the colon is the page number.) Example sentences where no
source is indicated were elicited from native speakers (see the acknowledg-
ments).
   The following abbreviations of the sources of the examples have been
used:

1.3.5. Notational conventions for morpheme-by-morpheme glosses1.3.5.1. General rules. In example sentences, all inflectional affixes are sepa-
rated by hyphens from their adjecent affix(es) or the stem. Derivational af-
fixes are separated only in the relevant sections of the morphology. Each
morpheme separated by a hyphen in the Lezgian text corresponds to an
element in the morphemic gloss. Stems are translated by English words, af-
fixes by abbreviated category labels.(i) When one Lezgian morpheme must be translated by two gloss elements
(English words or category labels), these are separated by a period, e.g.eQeö'-un                                   jaru-bur
go.out-MSD                             red-SBST.PL
(ii) When a category is expressed, but is not expressed by a separable mor-
pheme, it is separated in the gloss by a colon.wuna            (w-una? wu-na? wun-a?)
you:ERGzi              (z-i? zi-0?)
I: GEN
14       1. Introduction(iii) When a category is expressed by zero, its category label is put in paren-
theses.kilig!                     instead of:   kilig-0
look(IMPV)                               look-IMPV
1.3.5.2. Zero. Categories that are always expressed by zero are not shown in
the morphemic glosses for economy, e.g.ktab-ar                    instead of:   ktab-ar                 or:      ktab-ar-0
book-PL                                  book-PL(ABS)                    book-PL-ABS
k'el-zawa                  instead of:   k'el-zawa               or:      k'el-zawa-0
read-IMPF                                read-IMPF(NONPAST)              read -IMPF-NONPAST
1.3.5.3. Oblique stem suffix. A period in nouns separates the stem from the
(semantically empty) oblique stem suffix. Thus,dide.di-z                  instead of:   dide-di-z
mother-DAT                               mother-OBL-DATtar-ar.i-kaj               instead of:    tar-ar-i-kaj
tree-PL-SBEL                             tree-PL-OBL-SBEL
The Ergative case is marked by zero (like the Absolutive), but since the
Ergative case is formed from the oblique stem, it is always clearly distinct
from the Absolutive. It is therefore also shown in the morphemic glosses, as
an exception to 1.3.5.2. above.dide.di                    instead of:   dide.di                 or:      dide-di-0
mother(ERG)                              mother                          mother-OBL-ERG

(4) In personal pronouns (including reflexive pronouns), the oblique stem
suffix is not even shown by a period, again for reasons of economy.za-waj                     instead of:   z.a-waj                 or:     z-a-waj

"  The form k'ani is used as an attributive variant (or participle) of k'an
and is also the basis for substantivization (k'anidi), as exemplified by (293-

                                   (free omission of the subject)This sentence is ambiguous: On the first reading, the verb is intransitive
and no argument is omitted; on the second reading, the verb is transitive,
and the agent is omitted. This ambiguity affects all sentences with labile
verbs in which there is no Ergative NP present—e.g. (787a) could also mean
The pot was broken/one broke the pot.' But in such ordinary cases it is diffi-
cult to prove that there is real ambiguity in Lezgian, and not just two differ-
ent Russian or English equivalents that correspond to no difference in
Lezgian. However, when the verb is negated, as in (788), the semantic differ-
ence is so striking that translation is not necessary to bring out the ambigu-
ity. On the intransitive reading, Indian cows are (falsely) said to be immor-
tal, while on the transitive reading only that part of the lexical meaning of
the verb is negated which specifies that death is caused by an agent. All na-
tive speakers that I consulted confirmed that (788) can have two meanings,
the true meaning ('are not killed') and the false meaning ('do not die'). This
shows that the meaning 'caused by an agent' is indeed part of the lexical
meaning of a the transitive member of a labile verb pair.",[310]

      'Aminat swept the room with a broom.' (Lit. 'Aminat swept the
      broom through the room.')In the familiar European languages, the Lezgian local patients have to be
rendered as direct objects, and the Lezgian Absolutive themes correspond to
instrumental phrases. These instrumental phrases sound somewhat redun-
dant in the translations of (720M721) because the verbal actions ('stroke',
'sweep') are such that they are exclusively or typically carried out with these
instruments. But this is not the case in Lezgian because quite generally verb
meaning is more general than in the familiar European languages. For ex-
ample, gilc'un not only means 'stroke', but also 'wipe' (stoldiwaj pek giic'un
'wipe a table with a cloth') or 'rub', and elägun not only means 'sweep', but
also 'wave (with a cap)' and 'nod (one's head)'.
   These characteristics of Lezgian valence patterns can be generalized and
we can say that Lezgian shows a tendency toward a closer correspondence
between semantic roles and case-marking: Agents are always in the Ergative
case, themes are always in the Absolutive, recipients and experiencers are
always in the Dative, patients are always in one of the local cases. This is in
marked contrast to the familiar European languages, where nominative
subjects can be agents, themes, experiencers, and sometimes even patients,
accusative direct objects can be themes, patients, or experiencers, etc. It is
true that there are exceptions in Lezgian as well; for instance, the Absolutive
argument of kiligun (CABS/ DDAT) ' C looks at D' would appear to be an agent
rather than a theme, and Lezgian also has metaphorical expressions like i
banka.di pud litr q'ada (Talibov & Gad2iev 1966:207) 'this can holds three
liters'. But it cannot be denied that there is a tendency toward a closer link
between semantic roles and case-marking, so that we can call Lezgian a
""role-dominated language"" (cf. Foley & Van Valin 1984, A. E. Kibrik 1980b).

"  The particle jtiz can also be used in cases of multiple equative comparison
where the verb is omitted in the equative expression. This is in contrast to
multiple comparison of inequality (24.1.2.), where the verb must be present
even under identity. The difference seems to be due to the fact that the
marker of inequality is a case suffix, which can attach only to one noun,
whereas jtiz is a free particle which can follow a group of words.",[457]

21.4.7. The relative clause head q'wan 'whenever; as long as'Q'wan is originally a comparative particle which means 'as much as' (cf.
24.2.3.). But it can also be used, much like ö'awuz etc.in 21.4.6. above, as the
head of a relative clause, functioning as a quasi-conjunction. Its two mean-
ings are (a) 'whenever' (cf. 1082) and (b) 'as long as' (cf. 1083). The 'as long as'
meaning is closely related to the basic meaning 'as much as', and the
'whenever' meaning is related to the 'all that' meaning (see 24.2.3.).",[408]

Capital letters are sometimes used to represent NP arguments, sometimes with a subscript
indicating case, e.g. A, T, E DAT , LPOESS· Like mathematical variables, these letters are
strictly speaking meaningless. However, as a mnemonic help for the reader, non-arbitrary
letters were often chosen that can be thought of as standing for certain semantic roles:
A:        ""agent""
T:        ""theme""
E:        ""experiencer""
S:        ""stimulus""
L:        ""location""
R:        ""recipient""

1.1. The Lezgian language and its genetic affiliation
Lezgian is spoken by about 400,000 people in southern Daghestan and
northern Azerbaijan in the eastern Caucasus. (See 2.1. for details on Lezgian
speakers.) Lezgian has been written since 1928, first in the Latin alphabet,
from 1938 onward in the Cyrillic alphabet. This grammar describes the stan-
dard language, which is based on the lowland Güne dialect. (See 2.2. for
more on Lezgian dialects, and 2.3. for more information on the status of
Lezgian and the standard language.)
   Lezgian is a member of the Lezgic branch of the Nakho-Daghestanian
family of languages. The family tree of Nakho-Daghestanian is shown in (1)
(following Hewitt 1981a:197).","[20, 21]"

7.3.2. Nominal compoundingLezgian completely lacks determinative compounds, i.e. compounds of the
type Nhead Independent; where the compound denotes a kind of Nhead that is
characterized in some way by Ndependent·
108     7. Noun morphology   Reasonably common are copulative compounds, i.e. compounds of the
type NIN2, where the compound denotes the pair constituted by N j and N2.
N i and N2 may belong closely together as a pair (as in (239)), they may repre-
sent two particularly salient members of a larger class (as in (240)), or they
may have more or less the same meaning (as in (241)), so that the resulting
compound has roughly the same meaning as N j or N2.(239)     buba-dide                 'parents'                buba               'father'

derivation. In general, adjectives have to be substantivized before they can
be used as nouns (e.g. qacu 'green', qacu-di        'green one', see 8.1.1.).
However, in some cases adjectives are directly converted to nouns, without
any additional morphology.(244) wahSi        'wild animal'        wahSi            'wild'
      zehil        'youth'              zehil            'young'
      muq'wa       'relative'           muq'wa           'close'These nouns inflect regularly like other nouns (Singular oblique stem iehil-
di, Plural zehil-ar, etc.). Conversion from adjectives is frequent and produc-
tive only with adjectives denoting negative human qualities, e.g.(245) tempel             'lazybones'          tempel               lazy7
      nadinZ             'naughty child'      nadinz               'naughty'
      mut'laq'           'miser'              mut'laq'             'stingy'
      merdimazar         'harmful person'     merdimazar           'harmful'Nationality adjectives exhibit similar behavior (8.1.3.).","[127, 128, 129]"
