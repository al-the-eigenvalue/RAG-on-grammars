"Authorship of this bookThe first person pronoun used throughout this work refers to Don Kulick. I col-
lected all the linguistic and ethnographic data analyzed here over the course of
my thirty years’ work in Gapun. As mentioned above, I wrote the entire first draft
of this grammar and dictionary and submitted it for review at Pacific Linguistics in
2011. Shelving the project to complete other work, I took it up again in 2017, when
I approached linguist Angela Terrill, who had trained in descriptive linguistics at
ANU and written a grammar of the Papuan language, Lavukaleve, to collaborate
with me in rewriting the text (Terrill 2003). Angela worked on the morphological
and grammatical analysis in preparing the manuscript for publication.

Conventions and abbreviations
Tayap examples in the grammar usually consist of four lines. The first is the Tayap
speech written in bounded, unsegmented words.
     The second line is the same clause or sentence in which the words have been
separated into morphemes.
     The third line is the interlinear gloss of the morphemes. The space separating
the morphemes in the second and third lines is larger than it is in most grammars
for reasons of readability. The usual manner of presentation, in which glosses for
morphemes are chained together in long, complicated strings, assumes readers
with a great deal of specialized knowledge, experience and patience. Separat-
ing the morphemes should make the glosses easier to process. The spacing does
admittedly make it a bit harder to see individual words, but those appear in the
first line of the examples.
     The fourth line is the translation into English.
     An example is as follows:(1) Merewŋgrogi munje parŋgɨro
    Merew -ŋgro =gi             munje par     -ŋgɨ       -ro
    Sanae    -pl     =erg.pl man       bury.r -3sg.m.r.o -3pl.r.s
    ‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’Suffixes are marked by hyphens (-) and clitics are marked with an equal sign (=).
In Tayap there are no prefixes, only suffixes, and enclitics rather than proclitics.
      Some glossing conventions used throughout this grammar in the interlinear
glosses need to be noted. Tayap verbs – and other words – have a broad range of
meanings, and an o, for example, is consistently glossed as ‘strike’ in the interlin-
ear glosses, but is translated to its context-specific meaning as ‘hit’, ‘stab’, ‘kill’,
etc. in the translation. Similarly, the Locative case has a broad range of meanings.
It is glossed as loc when it has a locational meaning but in other contexts it may
be glossed as temp for temporal, com for comitative or all for allative.
      Further conventions need explanation are as follows:
      The first is the pipeline symbol | which appears in example 3 below under-
neath the final morpheme -n. This symbol means that the morpheme it glosses
has more than one meaning. Disambiguation occurs through the use of pronouns
or nouns, or through context.
      An S is used in glossing transitive verbs to show features of the subject. With
intransitive verbs, the person/number/status of subjects are marked in the lan-
guage but there is no S in the gloss.

                                            Conventions and abbreviations     XIX
    Another convention concerns Tayap’s discontinuous subject markers. Some
verbs have subject morphemes that occur both before and after the object mor-
pheme. An example is as follows:(2) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
    ŋgu    =yi      aram ta  -tɨ  -ŋgɨ                  -n
    3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -r.s -3sg.m.r.o            -r.s
    ‘she saw a snake’In this verb, the combination of -tɨ before the object morpheme and -n after the
object morpheme encodes either a 2sg or 3sg.f subject in realis status. The
pronoun ‘she’ disambiguates the subject to be 3sg.f, in this case. Since it is the
combination of the two discontinuous subject morphemes that produces meaning,
the labeling convention adopted here is to gloss the first subject morpheme
with ‘s’ (‘subject’), and to gloss the combined meaning of the two morphemes
under the second morpheme. The object morpheme in verbs like this case occurs
between the two subject markers, and is bounded by < > instead of hyphens, to
show that it intervenes between the two discontinuous subject markers.
    So in this grammar, the example above is written as:(3) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
    ŋgu    =yi      aram ta  -tɨ         -ŋgɨ        -n
    3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -s-         <3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
    ‘she saw a snake’The abbreviations used in the interlinear glosses otherwise generally follow the
Leipzig glossing rules.
    Note that the dictionary uses some different terms and abbreviations (see
page 351 for those).

1 The Tayap language and its speakers1.1 General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in
    GapunTayap is the name of a Papuan language spoken by a dwindling number of people,
most of whom live in a small village called Gapun (the speakers themselves call
the language Tayap mer, which means, precisely, ‘Tayap language’). Gapun is
located on the Papua New Guinea mainland, between the Sepik and Ramu rivers,
about thirty kilometers inland from the northern coast. The village is far from
roads of any kind and is difficult to reach. It lies in a mosquito- and leech-infested
swamp in the middle of the rainforest (see Map 1.1).
     The Tayap language is tiny, even by the extreme standards of Papua New
Guinea, where one linguist estimated that thirty five percent of the languages
have fewer than five hundred speakers (Sankoff 1980: 96). As far as anyone in
Gapun has been able to remember, Tayap has never had more than, at most, just
over one hundred speakers. That small number seems to have remained stable for
a very long time. By the 1980s, however, children were no longer learning Tayap
as their first language. Instead, they were learning Tok Pisin, the most important
and widely-spoken national language of Papua New Guinea.
     I began my work in Gapun in 1985. At that time, the number of people who
actively commanded Tayap – in the sense that they spoke it with other villagers
and were able to narrate stories in it – was about ninety, out of a population of
about one hundred and thirty (most but not all of whom lived in Gapun). Twenty
three years later, in 2009, the population of Gapun had grown to two hundred
and eight people. In addition, seventeen people who had been born and raised
in Gapun had left the village (mostly because of conflicts over land rights and
sorcery accusations) and moved to the village of Wongan, which is a ninety-
minute trip from Gapun, by foot and then dugout canoe across a vast mangrove
lagoon.
     If we were to include those people in a count of Gapuners the total population
would be two hundred and twenty five. And if their children, most of whom were
born and raised in Wongan, were to be included, the number of people who could
reasonably claim to be a Gapuner would be close to three hundred.
     Any way Gapuners are counted, it is clear that their numbers have doubled
over the past twenty years. However, during that same time, old people have died
and children have continued to learn Tok Pisin as their first language. By 2009,
fewer than twenty people still living in Gapun had grown up with Tayap as their
first language.https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-001

9.3.2 Coordination with -api ‘afterward’ (aft)The suffix -api links clauses that encode actions that occur consecutively, one
after the other. It is affixed to a verb that is fully inflected for person, number and
TAM and takes its own arguments. The suffix marks that verb as an action that
was or will be completed before the action in the clause that follows it occurred
or will occur.
    Like -a, -api can link clauses that involve either the same subject or different
subjects. Again, it joins full independent clauses.
    Examples are:(9-12) a. ŋa tuwkunetapi aikinet yure
          ŋa tuw         -ku -net            -api
          1sg wash.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr -aft            ai           -ki    -net                 yu =re

            ‘I’ll wash first, then I’ll come to you’        b. ŋgomiek       -api karep pwiek
           fight.3pl.r -aft moon rise.3sg.f.r
           ‘after they fought, the moon rose’9.3.3 Coordination with ŋgɨ(na)napi ‘therefore’, ‘for that reason’Some speakers pronounce this form ŋgu(na)napi, which indicates that it might be
analyzed as ŋgu (3sg.f)+ the coordinating suffix -api. So: ‘after it’.
    Ŋgɨnanapi (or ŋgɨnapi) is a freestanding word. It introduces a clause that
expresses cause or reason, thereby combining two main clauses:(9-13) a. ŋgɨgi Kama ŋgarkwanŋguk ŋgarkwanŋguk, ŋgɨnapi ŋgu wek
          ŋgɨ =gi        Kama ŋgar         -kwan         -ŋguk

            -irr neg
            ‘Yesterday a sore appeared [on his leg] and therefore he didn’t walk’9.3.4 Coordination with ayáta ‘although’, ‘it doesn’t matter that’, ‘never
      mind that’Ayáta is a word most familiar to the villagers as an interjection of impatience or
dismissal, in its meaning of ‘Stop it! or ‘Never mind’ (see Section 3.10). It is this
latter sense of dismissal that is expressed when the word is used in a sentence as
a clause-coordinating conjunction.(9-14) a. ayáta ŋɨ munje suman, nime ŋa namŋgarke
          ayáta       ŋɨ       munje suman nime         ŋa nam           -garke

          ‘It doesn’t matter that he’s a big man, he can’t talk to me like that’Note the position of the negative in the following sentence, and note also that its
scope covers both ‘go’ and ‘see’ verbs, which are both in their negative stripped
down form.        b. ayáta ŋɨ aikinana waraknet, ŋa wákare inda okɨ rarŋrɨ
           ayáta      ŋɨ     ai         -ki   -nana     warak -net

            ‘Even though they didn’t come, we’ll make food’Sentences with ayáta can also occur in construction with the verb in the clause
that follows ayáta in the prohibitive mood. For example:(9-15) a. ayáta tukur aiŋgarke, yim okɨtikenana
          ayáta     tukur ai            -ŋgarke yim o -kɨ -tike

            come.irr-irr-3pl.irr-intent dx
            ‘Even if night comes quickly, they’re going to come’9.4 Adverbial subordinate clauses9.4.1 Adverbial subordination with -re ‘when’, ‘if’, ‘while’ (sub)The suffix -re (realized as -de after n) attaches as a suffix to fully inflected verbs
and marks a verb as expressing the background condition in relation to which the
action indicated in the main clause occurs. This backgrounding nature of sub-
ordination is emphasized by the order of the subordinate and main clauses in
Tayap: the subordinate clause always precedes the main clause.
     In English, these are clauses that would be expressed with the subordinating
conjunctions ‘if’ and ‘when’. Unlike English, though, Tayap makes no distinc-
tion between ‘if’ and ‘when’, at least when referring to unreal events; both are
expressed by -re.
     These clauses are semantically subordinate in that they specify a precondi-
tion for the action of the main clause to occur. They are not considered medial-
final (cosubordinate) constructions, as the non-final verbs are structurally quite
different, for instance they are not obligatorily irrealis (Section 9.8).
                                             Adverbial subordinate clauses     259
    Examples are as follows:(9-16) a. ŋa aŋgok akrunetre, kambwan ambukrunet

           shame.r-sg.m.r
           ‘when he said that bad thing to me, I (m) became ashamed’When verbs in both subordinate and main clauses are constructed in the progres-
sive (see Section 8.3.1) the meaning of -re is ‘while’ and the actions indicated by
the verbs occur simultaneously, not sequentially.(9-17) a. ŋa prukakkutre, ŋɨ pororakut
          ŋa pruk         -ak     kut   -re  ŋɨ

            ‘the cassowary was drinking water when I (m or f) speared him’Negative conditionals occur paratactically without -re, perhaps because the
negation word wákare already ends in re:(9-18) yu ŋaŋan nam tariati wákare, ŋayi yu adrunet
       yu ŋaŋan       nam tar             -iati      wákare

        ‘If you (m or f) don’t listen to my talk, I (m) am going to hit you’9.4.2 Adverbial subordination with the hypothetical particles pi, pime,
      ndɨ (hypo)Counterfactual events are expressed by a main clause (‘I would have killed the
snake’) and a subordinate clause (‘if I had seen it in time’). As discussed in the fol-
lowing section, Section 9.4.3, counterfactual constructions, in addition to being
formed with a particular inflectional morphology, also obligatorily take a particle
that can be glossed as ‘hypothetical’.
    This particle, which can be either pi, pime or ndɨ marks the clause in which it
appears as the subordinate clause. These particles all have their own stress.
    Like the previous clauses, these clauses are semantically subordinate.
    For example:(9-19) a. pipiŋgabu aŋgwar pime, oŋgab wawarwekrɨknukun
          pipiŋgabu a        -ŋgwar pime, oŋgab

             ‘If he hadn’t gotten a pain, he would have worked sago’Unlike the clause-linking constituents -a, -api and -re, the hypothetical particles
pi, pime and ndɨ are not bound morphemes. They are free morphemes that tend to
be clause final, as the following examples show:(9-20) a. Mbanuŋ ewar awknet pi, wakŋgɨn
          Mbanuŋ ewar        awk -net            pi

              ‘If you were young, I would marry you’When appearing with a verb inflected in the intentional mood (see Sections 5.4.2.3
and Section 7.4), pi (or ndɨ, which is also sometimes used in this context) means ‘If
X want(s) to do Y…’. For example:(9-21) a. Kiki Potowre atɨkɨnana pi, namku wetak
          Kiki Potow       =re      atɨ                   -kɨ     -nana       pi

            ‘If you want to eat sago jelly, go and Sopak will give you some
            sago jelly’Ndɨ behaves slightly differently to pi and pime. Ndɨ is also a discourse marker
that highlights the noun phrase that it follows in ongoing talk (see Section 3.11.2).
However, when it occurs in a clause with a verb inflected in counterfactual mood,
ndɨ conveys a hypothetical meaning.
    Ndɨ is also the particle that usually follows the negation wákare in a negative
counterfactual sentence, for example:(9-23) ewar tukur aiki wákare ndɨ yim patɨr andɨkrɨkkun
       ewar       tukur ai             -ki   wákare ndɨ
       yesterday rain come.irr -irr neg               hypo       yim patɨr andɨk          -rɨk -ku         -n
       1pl house roof.cf -cf -3sg.f.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
       ‘If it hadn’t rained yesterday, we would have roofed the house’9.4.3 Counterfactual (cf)The counterfactual expresses an action or event that could have happened but
did not or cannot happen, as in ‘If he had gone hunting yesterday, he would have
speared a cassowary’, or ‘If you had been young, I would marry you’. Some of
the ways of constructing the counterfactual have become moribund in Tayap.
There are a number of morphologically rather complex subtypes. The counterfac-
tual has the largest degree of variation documented for any verb form in Tayap.
Already in the 1980s, I was told by senior men that a clause like ‘would have
gone’ could be expressed as wakret, waknet, wakrɨknet or wakrɨkret, and that all
of those verbs meant exactly the same thing.
     By 2009, the oldest fluent speakers were constructing counterfactual sen-
tences differently from what I had recorded in the 1980s. Those oldest speakers

were still able to produce counterfactual morphology, but they only inflected
one of the verbs in a counterfactual construction consisting of two clauses. Most
speakers under fifty, however, could not do even this. Those speakers constructed
counterfactual sentences without using any counterfactual morphology.
    And even relatively fluent Tayap speakers younger than forty have stopped
using Tayap in the main clause of a counterfactual construction.
    Senior men in the 1980s expressed the counterfactual as follows:             if-clause                                            then-clause

          pi, pime or ndɨ
Example:(9-24) njenum Mbowdirekɨ muŋgit wakndak pi, ŋgɨ ŋgat non wakŋgro
       njenum Mbowdi =rekɨ muŋgit wak1            -ndak      pi,

         ‘If the dogs had gone with Mbowdi the other day, they would have speared
         a cassowary’By 2009, the oldest fluent speakers were expressing counterfactuality by nominal-
izing the verb in the if-clause with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)gar (see Section 4.2):             if-clause                                            then-clause

       Mairum =erg.f 1sg =dat tobacco seedling give.irr -nfn.sg hypo1 Note that the counterfactual form of okɨ (‘go’) is exceptional. See Section 9.4.3.1.

       ‘If Mairum had given me a tobacco seedling, I would have planted it’ (lit.
       ‘Mairum hypothetically a giver of a tobacco seedling, I would have planted it’)Counterfactual morphology is still used in the example above, but unlike the
senior men in the 1980s, the oldest speakers of Tayap in 2009 only used it for the
verb of the then-clause. In this case, the counterfactual meaning of the if-clause
is borne by the hypothetical particle pi, pime or ndɨ, not by verb morphology.
Constructing a counterfactual sentence like this was a possibility earlier, and I
have a few recorded examples of this form from the 1980s. But they are rare. The
overwhelming majority of the examples I recorded in the 1980s inflected the verbs
in both the if-clause and the then-clause with the counterfactual morphology.
    Counterfactual morphology is completely absent in the language of fluent
speakers between the ages of forty and fifty-five in 2009. They consistently
express counterfactuality without using any counterfactual morphology at all:                 if-clause                                  then-clause

      ‘If they had seen Mbanaŋ, they would have chased him’ (lit. ‘Those
      hypothetically who are see-ers of Mbanaŋ, they will chase him’)This trend continues in the speech of speakers in their early forties and younger.
On the few occasions when these speakers formulate a counterfactual statement,
the entire then-clause is in Tok Pisin, not Tayap:               if-clause                                   then-clause

       (lit. ‘Me myself hypothetically present, you get big damage in the
       morning’; i.e. I would have beaten you up)It is possible that the counterfactual has been on its way out of Tayap for quite
some time. That, at any rate, may be one explanation for the fact that already in
the 1980s it exhibited the widest variation of any verbal morphology.
     Another explanation could be that the various forms, even if they had the
same literal meaning, had different stylistic nuances. If so, those nuances had
already been lost even in the speech of senior men in the 1980s.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285]"
"7.6.2 Supposition (supp)Another particle, mera, marks the epistemic status of an action or event as some-
thing that has been assumed but that the speaker believes does not correspond to
what actually happened. In other words, it is what Tayap speakers use to convey
a meaning like ‘I thought Paita had gone to Wongan’. A statement like that in
English conveys a belief that regardless of whether or not Paita did go to Wongan,
the speaker expected him to but believes that he did not.
     The modal particle mera that carries this meaning follows whatever part of
speech is the focus of the assumption. So it can occur after a noun, as in the
following:(7-43)   ŋa ndɨ nda namnak Ŋgemanŋi mera
         ŋa ndɨ nda nam           -nak         Ŋgeman =ŋi          mera
         1sg dm dm talk.r -1sg.f|1pl.r Ŋgeman =erg.m supp
         ‘I (f) thought it was Ŋgeman’ (who did it, but it wasn’t)Most commonly, mera follows a verb, thereby reframing what would have been a
statement as a supposition. For example:(7-44) ŋa namnet ŋɨ Potore okɨnet mera
       ŋa nam -net                   ŋɨ Poto  =re
       1sg talk.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r 3sg.m Wongan =all         o         -kɨ   -net             mera
         go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr supp
         ‘I (m) thought he would go to Wongan’ (but he didn’t)Without the modal particle, this sentence would mean ‘I thought: he will go
to Wongan’. Mera turns the statement into an assumption that, moreover, the
speaker believes did not come to pass. Note that these constructions always
involve the use of a phrase like ‘I thought’ or ‘I lied’ as exemplified here.
    The particle is also to express the action of having been fooled or lied to. So
‘they lied to us that you were dead’ is:

translation would be the expression ‘that damned X’ in both its positive and neg-
ative valences; so both ‘That damned kid really did well’ and ‘That damned cat
peed on my sofa’. Kapa follows pronouns, nouns and noun phrases, as in the
following examples:(7-46) a. ŋgu kapa weka numŋan noŋortakara

228         7 Mood7.6.4 Surprise counter to expectation (cs)Nímera expresses surprise that a situation has turned out contrary to one’s
expectations. It is a combination of the adverb, ni, which expresses a negative
state – the state of doing nothing or having nothing (see Section 3.4.1) – with the
suppositional particle mera (see above Section 7.6.2).
    An example that senior speakers used to explain the particle is as follows:
You tell another person to complete some work and then you leave them, thinking
that the person will not do the work. When you return, you find that the person
actually has done the work, at which point you might say:(7-47)   ŋa ndɨ yu nímera kut                       inda
         1sg dm 2sg cs               be.r.sg.m.r dx.m
         ‘I thought you (m) just were here’ (doing nothing, but you weren’t, you
         actually worked) (lit: ‘I was like, you just were here’)Another example is that people have come to your house and you expect them to
help you do some work, but they don’t. You might say:(7-48) yum nímera a           -ku -nana      mbekem?
       2pl cs          be.irr -irr intent come.2pl.r
       ‘So you’ve all come just to be here?’ (and do nothing even though I
       expected you to work?)A final example is that you are carving something and you want to make it look
like an object you have seen before – perhaps a small statue with a traditional
pattern. In the course of carving the piece, though, it ends up looking very differ-
ent from what you expected. Nímera here expresses the surprise you feel at this:(7-49) ŋa ndɨ nímera nirkrunana wákare ŋa ninukun
       ŋa ndɨ nímera nir              -kru         -nana

         neg      1sg make.r -s        <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
         ‘I thought it would turn out differently than the way it turned out’ (lit. ‘I
         intended to make it [one way], no, I made it [another way]’)
8 Complex predicates8.1 Complex predicates and complex clausesIn Tayap, the major division in complex structures is between combining verbs
versus combining clauses. Verb combining in Tayap is accomplished through
complex predicates, which can be serial verb constructions or complex predi-
cates involving the verb ‘to be’. Clause combining is of three types: Coordinate,
subordinate and cosubordinate constructions.
    This chapter deals with complex predicates, and the following chapter
(Chapter 9) deals with clause combining.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"
"3.9.2 Information questionsInformation questions are formed using one of the following interrogative words,
many of which are readily segmentable, e.g. anire ‘with whom’ can be segmented
as ani=re ‘who=com’; ani=yi is who=erg.f; ani=mat is who=poss, etc.:

affirmation or disagreement, as well as affective involvement with, or phatic
acknowledgement of, other people. These interjections form an utterance by
themselves:ore             ‘Yes’. This is a Watam-language borrowing that has all but
                replaced Tayap’s awo.awo             The Tayap word for the affirmative ‘Yes’. Since the 1980s,
                however, it has become replaced by ore, and the meaning of
                awo has shifted to express sarcastic agreement that would be
                translated in English as ‘Yeah, right’ or ‘Like I’m so sure’.
                The word has also taken on connotations of confrontation and
                violence. It is shouted at others whom one is prepared to strike.
                Parents use it frequently to threaten disobedient children, and
                an adult engaged in a shouting match with another adult might
                use it to signal that her or his patience is about to give in. When
                it is shouted with sharp, rising volume and strong stress on the
                final syllable awó, the word is a warning that means: ‘You haven’t
                listened to my warnings and now I’m about to come and hit you!’wákare         ‘No’. This is also the morpheme of negation, often shortened to
                wak when used to mean ‘No’ (as in: ‘Is there any food left?’ ‘No’).
                When asked as a sharp question with rising intonation, wákare
                signifies a threat, meaning: ‘So you’re not doing what I told you
                to do? (I’m therefore going to come and hit you)’.ario            ‘He/she/it is coming to get you’. This word is used to scare
                babies and small children. It is uttered preceded by the name of
                the person or thing that the caregiver wants the child to think is
                coming to get him or her, and is a vocative call, calling directly
                to the person or thing to come and get the baby (in order to hit
                the baby, or devour the baby).kapambínana ‘Exactly’, ‘Of course’

                          ‘Oh no!’ This sound is frequently used by caregivers to scare
                          children. At least when children are very young, the alarmed
                          quality of this sound can be an effective way of making
                          them move away from an open fire or put down a sharp
                          butcher knife. If the child is still a baby, this sound is often
                          accompanied by the caregiver wrapping her or his arms
                          around the baby as if to protect the baby;
                      (2) when uttered with an extended vowel and a curled lip, it
                          means: ‘Gross’; ‘Disgusting’; ‘Feel shame’.amaye                 An expression moaned and cried by people experiencing

expresses a desire that some action be performed by someone else or something
else. Here the subjunctive occurs in the “desire” clause, after an expression of
cognition in the main clause. It is the appearance of the verb in its subjunctive
form that generates the meaning of the verb in the main clause as one of desire,
rather than cognition.(7-19) a. ŋa numbwan pikun ŋɨ onet Merewre
          ŋa numbwan pi            -ku                -n

212        7 MoodThis construction using an expression of cognition in the main clause and a sub-
junctive in the subordinate clause is unusual – examples (7-19a) and (7-19b) are
from elicitation sessions with senior men in the 1980s. I have not encountered
this construction in any of the conversations or speeches that I have transcribed.
Instead, desire predicates are constructed in one of two ways, none of them
involving the subjunctive.
     The first way of forming a desire predicate is with the verb phrase ‘arei + erga-
tive + tar’, which literally means ‘desire takes’. This is a moribund construction:
like examples (7-19a-b) above, my only recorded instances of it are in elicitation
sessions in the 1980s with senior informants.
     The construction is realized without overt marking on the main clause, and
the verb in the subordinate clause is inflected for future tense:(7-20) ŋɨ areiyi tatɨŋgɨn ŋa okɨnet Potowre
       ŋɨ       arei     =yi        ta     -tɨ   -ŋgɨ        -n

       1sg go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.r Wongan =all
       ‘he wants me to go to Wongan’ (lit. ‘desire takes him, I will go to Wongan’)The most common way to express the desire that someone or something else do
something that you want is to use the verb nam, which has the primary meaning
of ‘talk’ or ‘tell’, but which is also used to mean ‘think’ (this kind of semantic
conflation between verbs like “talk”, “tell”, “think” and “desire” is common in
Papuan languages; Reesink 1993).
     Desire predicates with nam are constructed the same way as the example
above, that is to say with the verb in the subordinate clause inflected in the future
tense. Speakers also often use the adverb nande ‘thusly’ to draw attention to the
verb of desire, producing sentences like the following:(7-21) ŋa nande namnet yu okɨtet Ombágire
       ŋa nande nam -net                   yu o    -kɨ  -tet

       Pankin=all
       ‘I want you to go to Pankin’ (lit. ‘I say/think thusly: you will go to Pankin’)

7.2 Prohibitive (proh)In contrast to the imperative mood, which expresses the speaker’s command for
the addressee to perform a particular action, the prohibitive is a command to not
perform an action. It can be translated as ‘Don’t do X’, ‘Don’t dare do X’ or ‘X is
prohibited’. The prohibitive cannot be negated. It is formed as follows:    person
    ŋa ‘I’
    yu ‘you’
                                  irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgarke
    ŋgu ‘she’
    ŋɨ ‘he’
    yim ‘we’    yum ‘you pl’     →            irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgremke
    ŋgɨ ‘they’       →            irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgroke
    dl               →            irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgrekeIf a speaker includes the benefactive object in this construction, the action is
marked as ongoing, in the progressive aspect, so it means ‘Don’t be doing X!’(7-22) a. emarar -ŋgarke!
          play.irr -proh.sg|1pl
          ‘you can’t play!’ or ‘it’s forbidden to play!’; said for example to a child

           ‘you can’t be here!’7.3 Admonitive (adm)A structure that is morphologically almost identical to the prohibitive occurs in
the modal construction that expresses the non-desirability of an action.
     This modality in Tayap has its exact equivalent in the Tok Pisin expression
“nogut X”, where X denotes an action that the speaker doesn’t want to happen,
regrets happening, is uncertain has happened or will happen, or when the speaker
anticipates or senses that something undesirable will ensue from the action’s
occurrence. This is a difficult expression to translate, because it can be a warning,
as in ‘X better not happen/have happened’; a negative hope, as in ‘I hope X doesn’t
happen’ (or, ‘I hoped X wouldn’t happen’); a concern, as in ‘May X not happen’; or
a meditation, like ‘What if X should happen?’. The admonitive cannot be negated.
     In Tayap, this construction differs from the prohibitive only in that the final
-ke of the prohibitive markers is -ana in the admonitive, and that there is no ben-
efactive in it:      person
      ŋa ‘I’
      yu ‘you’
                                 irr verb root + -ŋgarana

      dl                →        irr verb root + -ŋgreanaExamples:(7-23) a. ror     aŋgu eiar         -ŋgarana

          who is talking                 better not talk’; said to someone who
                                         knows a secret about another person
                                         and is going to visit that person; the
                                         speaker is expressing the hope that
                                         the person addressed won’t open his
                                         or her mouth and spill the beans7.4 Intentional (intent)The intentional mood expresses two kinds of events. The first is actions that are
or were intended or desired but that have not been completed or that didn’t occur
or won’t occur. The second kind of event expressed by the intentional mood is an
inevitable action: an action that often, in retrospect, ended in a foreseeable way.
    An example of this latter sense is the response of a woman seeing a photograph I
had taken of a gravely ill Monei Mbanaŋ; he had been sick for weeks and I photographed
him as he was about to be carried to a canoe and taken to a hospital, where he died a
few days later. Upon seeing this photograph months after Monei had died, looking at
a desiccated and paralyzed Monei, this woman murmured waso-kɨ-nana (die.irr-irr-
intent) ‘he’s about to/intending to die’, in a soft, rising voice expressing sorrow.
    The intentional mood was mentioned earlier in the section on the near future
tense (5.4.2.3) because it is constructed in a similar way, with the bound morpheme
216        7 Mood-ana (-nana after a vowel; this form is often reduced and realized as -na) affixed
directly to the irrealis object marker (for transitive verbs) or directly to the irrealis
marker -ki-, -kɨ- or -ku- (for intransitive verbs). So the structure is as follows:transitive verbs       irr verb stem + irr object + -(n)anaintransitive verbs     irr verb stem + irr morpheme + -(n)anaExamples of the intentional mood are:(7-25) a. ewar ŋa sokoi akrunana, sokoi wákare

of’, as in the following, consisting of two juxtaposed main clauses:

suffix cannot be negated. Instead negative intention is expressed by negating
another verb of the sentence (7-27), or by a word like mɨnda ‘tired of’, ‘sick of’ that
expresses negative affect (7-28):(7-27)   a. ŋa aiki wákare ŋɨ rarŋgrɨnana

          ‘they don’t want to eat sago jelly’ (lit. ‘they’re tired of eating sago jelly’)The intentional suffix is also used in negative indirect commands (see Section 7.1.4).","[231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237]"
"7.1 Subjunctive (sbj)Tayap has a distinct set of verb forms that encode a speaker’s desire that another
person do something. The underlying syntactic structure in which a subjunctive
appears is a subordinate clause (i.e. ‘I want that X do Y’), but a separate set of
subjunctive forms can also occur in a main clause. Since those forms only occur
in indirect commands, they are discussed below in Section 7.1.5.
     The inflectional pattern for intransitive and transitive verbs in the subjunc-
tive mood is as follows:
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-007
                                                                    Subjunctive (sbj)         201
transitive verbs              subjunctive verb stem inflected as class 5 verb + realis subject
                              and object endings
intransitive verbs            subjunctive verb stem + realis subject ending
Below are the subjunctive inflections for the intransitive verb aiki ‘come’ and the
class 3 transitive verb a ‘eat’. To clearly see the difference between the subjunc-
tive and the indicative, the indicative inflections of those verbs appear in the two
right-hand columns:(7-1)                                                                       indicative

A verb like aiki ‘come’ notwithstanding, the subjunctive stem form of most verbs
has the same realization as the verb’s irrealis stem form. The exceptions to this
pattern are discussed in Sections 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.2.2 below.
    The subjunctive in Tayap is used to express the following speech acts:
(a) direct imperatives (‘Take this food to Kapiru!’)
(b) jussive imperatives (‘Let her go’);
(c) indirect commands (‘Tell them to hit him’; ‘Make them go away’);
(d) wishes (‘I want you all to go to Sanae’)
Each of these four uses of the subjunctive involves different grammatical and syn-
tactic components. A direct imperative can, by itself, constitute a sentence. Jussive
imperatives involve the fixed expression ŋganokaw, which does not change for
person or number. Indirect commands can be expressed in two ways, one using
the subjunctive in both the main clause and the subordinate clause; and one just
juxtaposing two independent clauses in the declarative mood. The expression of
a wish, similarly, has several forms, only one of which involves the subjunctive.
202        7 Mood7.1.2 ImperativeThe imperative mood expresses a command that is directly addressed to one
person (‘you come!’) or to several people (‘you all come!’). In Tayap there are two
kinds of imperatives: positive imperatives – commands to do something – and
negative imperatives, commands to not do something.
     Negative imperatives have a particular morphology and are discussed under
prohibitives and admonitives (see Sections 7.2 and 7.3).
     Positive imperatives – a command that an addressee perform some action –
are realized differently for intransitive and transitive verbs.","[220, 221, 222]"

            3sg.f shake.r -mod go.3sg.f.r
            ‘she shivered’The difference in meaning between these two forms is subtle. Speakers say that
the fully inflected forms – those in (9-36a) and (9-37a) above – are synonymous
with the -ra forms – those in (9-36b) and (9-37b). Some verbs – ‘jump’ for example –
regularly occur in both forms. At the same time, however, it is clear that the
morpheme -ra does not just link two verbs in a temporal sequence like the con-
junction –(y)a does (Section 9.3.1). Instead, -ra modifies both the verb to which it
affixes and the verb of motion that follows it, creating a new lexical predicate out
of two independent verbs.
     In an important sense, all complex predicates create new lexical verbs by
linking together a series of different verbs. But the difference in this case is this:
other kinds of sequences in Tayap create complex predicates by conjoining verbs
that retain their separate lexical meaning even as they link together in sequences
with other verbs. Their meaning is additive – each verb contributes its particular
meaning to the final compound construction. So a sequence like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨ-
takana (Section 8.1ff) that was discussed in the previous chapter is composed of sep-
arate constituents that each add their own meaning to the action being expressed,
resulting in a verb that means ‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’.
     Complex clauses created with the -ra suffix, on the other hand, are not addi-
tive, they are transformative. A complex clause created with -ra is not so much the
sum of its parts as it is a new semantic entity. Although many verbs formed with -ra
do retain a transparent relation to the independent verbs that derive them, others
have meanings that are completely different from the two verbs that compose
them. So ‘faint’, for example, is wasowra aiki- (wasow ‘die’ + -ra + aiki ‘come’).7
     Another way in which the -ra suffix transforms verbs is that it reduces their
valency. Compare the verb worer ‘capsize’ in constructions formed with -ra, and
7 This suffix occurs on at least one noun: the way to express that a body part has ‘fallen asleep’,
as one says in English, is to use the derived verb sɨwɨdɨdɨmra okɨ, which comes from the word for
small black ants; so sɨwɨdɨdɨm ‘ants’ + -ra + okɨ ‘go’.

in serial verb constructions formed with a non-final verb + a final verb like those
discussed in Section 8.2:(9-38) a. ewar yimbar worerara wok

          ‘yesterday they tipped over the canoe’(9-39) a. awin worerara wok
          awin worer          -ara wok
          water capsize.irr -mod go.3sg.f.r

          ŋa =yi       awin worer    -ku                     wok
          1sg =erg water capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o              go.3sg.f.r
          ‘I poured the water’Notice how the first sentences in these pairs (9-38a) and (9-39a) only has one argu-
ment – the subject, ‘canoe’ in (9-38a) and ‘water’ in (9-39a). The second sentences
have two arguments – subject (‘they’ and ‘I’) and object (‘canoe’ and ‘water’).
     Negation on verbs marked with -ra is only marked on the independent verb
that carries TAM, but its scope is both/all verb stems. So the negation of a verb
like ‘jump’ is:(9-40) ŋɨ       pɨŋ      -ra     atɨ           -kɨ   wákare
       3sg.m jump.r -mod go_down.irr -irr neg
       ‘he didn’t jump down’ or ‘he won’t jump down’9.8.2 Cosubordinate constructions with manner suffix -kar (mann)Like clause chains constructed with -ra, those formed with -kar also add a mor-
pheme directly onto the irrealis stem of a verb that precedes a verb of motion, thus
creating a medial verb. Unlike the -ra forms, however, constructions formed with
-kar or its allophonic variant -kwar (the environment triggering the alternation
278         9 Simple and complex sentencesis unknown) maintain the separate meanings of the modified verb and the verb
of motion that follows it. The suffix -kar creates a manner medial verb, one that
answers the question ‘How or in what manner did X go/come, etc.?’
    Verbs constructed with -kar are constructed in the following way:      irr verb stem + -kar/-kwar + fully inflected verb of motionVerbs formed with -kar encode the simultaneity of both actions for the duration
of both actions. In English, this temporal relationship would be rendered with the
adverbial ‘as’, as in ‘They were laughing as they washed the dishes’, or participle
clauses, as in ‘Laughing, they washed the dishes’. In other words, the first action,
laughing, occurred simultaneously with, and continued for the same length of
time as, the second action, washing the dishes.
    This foregrounding of duration and simultaneity results in awkward literal
translations, as in the following example:(9-41) nda mbɨd non         rekɨ ai        -kar wek
       dm pain indef with come.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
       ‘she came feeling pain as she came’A more idiomatic translation would be with an English adverbial phrase; some-
thing that highlighted the experience of pain as during travel, like ‘In pain, she
made her way here’.
    Cosubordinate constructions created with the -kar suffix also highlight an
action or process that has begun and is continuing, especially when the con-
struction is used with an inanimate subject. In English, this kind of phrase
would use a verb of inception, like ‘begin’ or ‘start’, or a verb of intensifi-
cation or process, like ‘growing’ or ‘becoming’; for example: ‘his anger was
growing’.
    The verb of motion that follows the medial verb created with the -kar suffix is
most commonly either ‘go’ (okɨ) or ‘come’ (aiki), although any verb of motion may
occur in this slot. Examples are:(9-42) a. ŋgu    warak     -kar wek
          3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
          ‘she came talking’         b. ŋɨ       ŋgar          -kwar mbot
            3sg.m call_out.irr -mann go.sg.m.r
            ‘he called out as he went along’
                                                Cosubordinate constructions      279
The sense of development and process means that these verb forms can co-occur
with other chained forms, such as the -ra forms, for example:(9-43) minjike =ŋa        mbatep pwak         -ra    o       -kar     wek
       betel_nut =poss unit        drop.irr -mod go.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
       ‘the flowers on the betel nut (palm) are in the process of opening’This suggests that the -ra clause and the -kar clause are syntactically equivalent,
both equally dependent on the final verb wek ‘come’.
    The directionality of the verb of motion (‘go’ or ‘come’) can express a differ-
ence in meaning, as in the following:(9-44) a. toto andɨ           -kar      wek
          skin swell.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
          ‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (in various places because bees have stung me)        b.    toto andɨ          -kar      wok
             skin swell.irr -mann go.3sg.f.r
             ‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (from a central point and spreading outwards)This kind of semantic difference encoded by different verbs of motion may have
been more productive in the past, and subtle nuances may have been eroded and
lost over the course of the last few decades. Today, senior speakers insist that with
only a few exceptions, such as (9-44a) and (9-44b) above, verbs formed with ‘go’
and ‘come’ have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably.
     Chains with -kar are negated by placing the negative marker after the inde-
pendent verb. So the negated form of example (9-42a) is:(9-45) ŋgu    warak      -kar    ai      -ki wákare
       3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.irr -irr neg
       ‘she was not talking as she came’The scope of negation in manner constructions has to include the medial verb.
Thus, the negated sentence means that the woman probably still came (the sen-
tence probably would not have been uttered if she hadn’t come); she just didn’t
come talking.
     This seems to indicate that -kar (and in fact -ra) are complex verbal con-
structions rather than adverbials, since negation of adverbials would be
expressed with the negator directly after the adverbial, not as here at the end
of the clause.
280        9 Simple and complex sentences9.9 Tail-head linkageTayap makes extensive use of tail-head linkage, a phenomenon in which the
last verb of one sentence is repeated as the first verb of the next sentence. It is a
coherence device for structuring discourse and is very common among Papuan
languages (de Vries 2005). In de Vries’s terms, Tayap’s tail-head linkage is the
chained type, utilizing the basic complex clause structures of the language,
namely coordination and subordination.
     Some examples, which are taken from the Tayap Texts at the end of this
grammar, are presented below (see those texts for many more examples of this
phenomenon).

           ‘It died and there…’In most cases of tail-head linkage, only the verb is repeated. The second instance
of the verb usually occurs with a conjunction marker to connect it to the clause
that follows. However, other material can be repeated too: an example is the
oblique NP repeated with the verb in lines (9-47 a-b).
282          9 Simple and complex sentences9.10 Complex constructions with the suffix signifying
     multiplicity -rar (ml)The final suffix occurring on complex sentences is -rar. This suffix signifies
that the action denoted by the verb occurred in relation to multiple objects – so
‘look at many things’ instead of just ‘look’, or ‘shoot at many things’ instead of
just ‘shoot’. The suffix -rar is always used on transitive verbs. The object mor-
pheme is always in the realis form. TAM is marked on the final, independent
verb of motion that follows the medial verb. Even though the action of the verb
happens multiple times, the object is still singular. So the structure of this form
is as follows:      transitive verb stem irr + object r + -rar + verb of motion inflected for
      subject, TAM and statusExamples are as follows:(9-49) a. tar        -ku         -rar mbet
          take.irr -3sg.f.r.o -ml come.sg.m.r

            ‘he shot various things as he went’ (or ‘I (m)’ or ‘you (m)’)If the object slot is filled by a ben object rather than a direct object, then -rar is
realized as -tar (see examples 9-49c and d below):      transitive verb stem irr + ben object r + -tar + verb of motion inflected for

Verbs constructed with -rar are negated by negating the final, fully inflected verb
in the series. And like -kar verbs, the scope of negation covers the whole construc-
tion. So the negated form of (9-49a), above, is:(9-50) tar        -ku          -rar ai-ki       wákare
       take.irr -3sg.f.r.o     -ml come.irr-irr neg
       ‘he didn’t come collecting several’9.11 Complex sentences in young people’s TayapYoung people use a great deal of tail-head linkage in their narratives. The narra-
tor of Text 4, for example – a twenty-year-old man with good passive Tayap but
limited active command of the language – uses tail-head linkage in fifty percent of
his clause conjunctions. Compare this with between roughly ten to twelve percent
in Texts 1–3, which were narrated by more fluent speakers.
     Subordinate and cosubordinate clauses are beyond the capability of most
Tayap speakers younger than thirty. A few of the most skilled passive active speak-
ers (such as the twenty-five-year-old narrator of Tayap Text 3) can use the subordi-
nating morpheme -re to produce ‘when’ clauses (see lines 26 and 51 in Tayap Text 3).
But hypothetical morphemes – like the counterfactual mood that often accompa-
nies it – are mostly dead, and in fifty five of the fifty six narratives by young people
that I collected in Gapun, there is not a single instance of relativization.8
     Young people’s narratives are strings of events presented paratactically –
X did Y, Z happened, Q did P. Sometimes, the events are narrated with no
clause-linking morphology, as in the following extract, from a narrative told
by a twenty-three-year-old man (hesitations, false starts and interruptions and
encouragements by another speaker have been edited out of this extract):8 The single exception is a complex narrative in flawless Tayap told by a twenty-nine-year-old
young woman named Mbonika Amburi (the same Mbonika who features as a six-year-old girl
in the opening vignette of Kulick 1992). Mbonika is the paradigm example of the passive active
speaker. She never speaks more than a few formulaic phrases of Tayap to anyone, and knowing
her well and seeing her every day, I had come to assume that her command of the vernacular was
minimal. After being astonished by the fluency of her Tayap narrative, I asked her why she never
spoke the language. She is ashamed, she told me. She feared that if she spoke Tayap and said
something wrong, the old people in the village would laugh at her. “They’ll criticize”, she told
me. “They’ll say, ‘You all speak Tok Pisin too much and so you don’t know the vernacular’. For
that reason, I’m ashamed to speak the vernacular” (“Ol bai wokim koments, ‘Tok Pisin i planti na
yupela i no save long tok ples’. Na olsem na mi save sem long tok ples.”)

which are typical of the kinds of errors made by young speakers), note that he
does not use a single coordinating, cosubordinating or subordinating morpheme
throughout this entire stretch of speech. The verb phrases that make up the nar-
rative are simply placed one after the other with no linkage between them. (The
final a of the nonce word taina could be a coordinating morpheme, but this is
hard to know since the word doesn’t mean anything.)
     Much more commonly than simply listing verb phrases one after the other,
young speakers link clauses with the coordinating conjunction -(y)a. Here is an
extract from a narrative about a pig hunt by a twenty-six-year-old man who is one
of the more advanced younger speakers in the village:(9-52)   … Ŋa motɨnɨ warukpeta mbet. Mbeta mborma ndow tankuna anpekuna
         mbot. Ŋa mbot yɨwɨr rar/yɨwɨr tankun, mbot, yɨwɨrkɨ and. Na ŋa ŋganet…
         Ŋa motɨnɨ waruk               -pet     -a      mbet
         1sg again turn_back.r -sg.m.r -and come. sg.m.r
9 The correct form is either tanin ‘he saw me’ or tanŋgɨn ‘I saw him’.
10 The speaker wants a non-future verb here – nitukun ‘she made’. But even the progressive verb
he uses is incorrectly inflected. The form he wants is nirkwanuk ‘she was making’.

(see Section 6.1.5). The form he wants is kandukun, not the nonce form he creates
by using the verb root as the basis for the non-future inflection. But regardless of
his difficulty inflecting some verbs, he nevertheless is able to link verb phrases
into a coherent narrative. He does this with a single morphological tool, however:
the coordinating conjunction -(y)a.
     This morpheme has been over-extended in the speech of most young speak-
ers to do the work of all coordinating, cosubordinating and subordinating mor-
phemes. The reason for this over-extension is probably twofold.
     First, -a occurs frequently in Tayap, as a way to link coordinated clauses (see
Section 9.3.1).
     Second, the suffix -a, especially when it appears in speech after verbs ending
in n – verbs like tankun and *andpekun in the narrative above – sounds a lot like
(and behaves syntactically a lot like) Tok Pisin’s conjunction “na”, which means
‘and’. That Tok Pisin is never far from the minds of young Tayap speakers is
evident at the end of the above narrative, when the speaker briefly code-switches
into Tok Pisin, precisely to link two clauses.
     Cosubordinate verbs formed with the multiple suffix, -rar, do not appear in
the narratives I collected from speakers younger than thirty, and verbs formed
with the modifying -ra suffix only occur when they have become lexicalized, in
verbs like worer-ara wok ‘pour’ or wasow-ra wek ‘faint’.
286        9 Simple and complex sentences     The only kind of cosubordinate construction that young speakers do some-
times use is verbs formed with the medial manner suffix -kar. A small number of
verbs recur in the different narratives. These verbs always encode motion, never
process or development, and they are verbs that have probably been lexicalized,
like rar-kar mbot (‘I looked and came’), mar-kar ŋgwok (‘they rowed away’), and
amai-kwar wek (‘I was searching as I came’).
     However, the -kar form remains productive for at least some speakers, who
produced verbs like the following:(9-53) a. mɨri    adu         -kwar *weske
          forest break.irr -mann come_outside.dl
          ‘the two of us came crashing out of the forest’; *weske has no meaning;
          the speaker wants uske, from the verb root aski-.       b. naw           apu          -kwar ŋgwek
          grassland burn.irr -mann come.3pl.r
          ‘they burned and came’; a morphologically correctly formed but
          semantically incorrect verb – the speaker was talking about men
          lighting fire to a grassland to drive game out towards men waiting
          with spears, and she wants otar war-kwar ŋgwek: ‘fire light.irr-mann
          come’; lit. ‘they lit fire while coming’.       c. ŋgat        sene am           -kwar ŋgwek
          cassowary two fight.irr -mann come.3pl.r
          ‘the two cassowaries were fighting with one another as they came’;
          the speaker wants the dual form of ‘come’, weke.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306]"
"9.4.3.1 How to form a counterfactual verb
Counterfactual morphology is quite specific. Intransitive verbs use their irrealis
stems, and transitive verbs their realis stems.
     The actual stem form of many intransitive verbs is the same as their irrealis
form. But other verb stems have suppletive forms. They change in regular ways,
but most of the forms occur nowhere else in Tayap (an exception is the counter-
factual form for o ‘go’, which is the same as that verb’s habitual stem, see Section
8.3.2). The changes to the verb stems are as follows:    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain e → wek
    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain o → wak
    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain i → ik
    class 3 verb stems, a → akexceptions:     (1) the verb ‘be’, a-, becomes awk in cf
                (2) the verb ‘marry’, ar-, remains the same and does not change
                    to ak in cfThe following is a full list of how counterfactual intransitive verbs are formed.

                       (in most cases this
                       is the same as the
ŋɨ ‘he’                stem in irrealis)                           -ret (cf) or -net (irr)
ŋgu ‘she’                                                          -rak (cf) or -tak (irr)

Note that the counterfactual -rɨk is always stressed, in which point it differs from
the formally identical progressive marker also -rɨk (see Section 8.3.1.1).
     The counterfactual affix -rɨk is optional in those cases where the form of
the verb stem in the counterfactual differs from its form in the irrealis. So, for
example, a verb like ‘be’ is realized as a in its irrealis form, but in the counter-
factual, it becomes awk. This partially suppletive stem change makes the coun-
terfactual morpheme -rɨk redundant. Therefore, it can be omitted. But it doesn’t
have to be omitted.
     The phrase ‘she would have been’ can thus be expressed in any of the follow-
ing four ways:      awk-rɨk-rak
      awk-rɨk-tak
      awk-rak
      awk-takTransitive verbs display a similar range of variation. They can be formed in ways
that either include or exclude the following morphemes in parentheses. Note the
realis forms of the subject and object affixes:

                                6.1.6)So a verb like ‘I would have eaten it’ has the following forms, all of which senior
speakers insist mean the same:2verb stem.cf + (-rɨk) + (-nv/-tv)           + object.r + subject.r
     ak-       -rɨk       -nu-                 <ku>        -n             →     akrɨknukun2
     ak-       -rɨk                             -ku        -n             →      akrɨkkun
     ak-                  -nu-                 <ku>        -n             →      aknukun
     ak-                                        -ku        -n             →        akkunAs with intransitive verbs, all these options for variation only apply to verbs that
alter their stems in the counterfactual. They don’t apply to a verb like moser
‘buy’, for example, because that verb has the same stem form in both the irrealis
and the counterfactual (since moser isn’t a class 1, 2 or 3 verb; see the discussion
above about which verbs change their stem form in the counterfactual).3 In this
case, where the stem does not change to express the counterfactual, the coun-
terfactual morpheme -rɨk is needed – even if the -nv/-tv subject morphemes are
optional.
     So the full range of inflectional options listed above applies to verbs like o
‘hit’ or wawar-(p/w)-e ‘hang up’, because to express counterfactuality, those verb
stems change and become wak and wawarwek respectively. In those instances,
once again, the counterfactual affix -rɨk is redundant, since the stem change
already signals counterfactuality.
     Negative counterfactual actions are expressed by simply negating the rele-
vant subordinate verb as in a main clause, and following this with one of the
hypothetical particles (most commonly ndɨ), then expressing the main clause in
the counterfactual as usual:
2 In the morphological combination -rɨknukun, the morpheme-medial n and u undergo metath-
esis, resulting in [ɾɵkunkun]
3 To lessen the risk for confusion, the verb stem of such verbs is glossed as cf in counterfactual
constructions, even though the stem is identical with its irr form. An example is (9-23).

reference of an NP by specifying the role of the referent of that NP in the situation
described by the [relative clause]” (Andrews 2007: 206). Relative clauses in Tayap
are nominalized, marked with the inanimate possessive clitic =ŋa(n) which
appears on the verb of the relative clause. This possessive clitic =ŋa(n) is added
to a fully inflected verb, which then functions as a subordinate relative clause.
The common argument or head (“domain nominal” in Andrews’ 2007 terms) of
a relative and a main clause can be in S, A, O or oblique function in the relative
clause and in the main clause.
     Tayap relative clauses are external. The relative clause generally directly
follows the common argument in the main clause. This is the position held by a
nominal modifier (e.g. adjective) as well (see Chapter 4).
     The common argument may also be expressed with a deictic (Section 3.8)
functioning resumptively with respect to the head noun, and typically following
the common argument directly: for example, consider (9-29a-b). In both examples
there are two resumptive pronouns, in (9-29a) following the relative clause and as
the final part of the main clause and in (9-29b) following the common argument
and as the final part of the main clause. Note that these resumptive pronouns agree
in gender and number with the common argument. They are not an obligatory part
of relative clauses: see for example (9-29c) and (9-29f), which do not have them.
     Note that the verb of the relative clause is fully inflected, and the relative
clause contains all the usual components of a clause. The relative clause may
                                                          Relative clauses     269
even contain a complex predicate: see for example (9-29f) which has a relative
clause with a serial verb construction involving kv ‘bring’ in construction with a
verb (see Section 8.2.3.1).
     Relative clauses would appear to always be restrictive. No non-restrictive rel-
ative clauses have been found in the data. In the following example the posses-
sive marker is in bold and the head noun in the main clause underlined.(9-29) a. nɨm puŋgokawukŋan aŋgi kopi aŋgi

show whether the common argument is syntactically a part of the relative clause
or part of the main clause. However the main clause of (9-29d) can be negated
using wákare before munje (and changing the verb kiraw to kirawŋgrɨ). This sug-
gests that munje belongs syntactically in the relative clause rather than the main
clause. However more examples are needed to be certain.
    Tayap used to have another relativizing suffix: the morpheme -gin (or perhaps
it was a clitic =gin, there is not enough evidence to show). This morpheme seems
to be synonymous with, and occurs in exactly the same morphological slot as,

clitic, and carry the meaning of consequence; that a particular state has been
brought into existence because of an action. For example:(9-31)   kokɨr mbɨdtia ŋaŋan noŋor kokɨr kratianŋa
         kokɨr mbɨd      -t -ia4             ŋaŋan noŋor kokɨr

         break.r -s <1sg.ben.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s =poss
         ‘my head hurts because my wife hit me on the head’9.7 Perception constructionsSentences that describe an act of perceiving, like seeing or smelling, can be
expressed in two ways in Tayap: either paratactically as two separate clauses, or
with a nominalized construction.
     In the perception construction, the perceiver is subject of the main clause,
and the person or thing perceived is object. In the subordinate (nominalized)
clause, always placed after the main clause, the action expressing the circum-
stances of the perception is indicated. Coreferential with the main clause object
is the thing perceived, which may be subject or object in the subordinate clause.
     The two possibilities are exemplified below:

that directly follows example (7-29) in Chapter 7.

performs that action. That action is nominalized with the possessive clitic =ŋa(n).(9-33) ambagaiyi tatukun maya wopikunŋan

5 Note that number agreement is not consistent in examples (9-32a) and (9-32b): the speaker
uses the form ‘woman (SG) two’ rather than the dual form naŋaw or the plural naŋro, and the
object agreement is plural rather than dual. These two examples were from an elicitation session
and the inconsistency was noticed too late to be queried directly.
                                                  Perception constructions      273
One argument, the subject or the object of the main clause, is coreferent with
either the subject or object of the nominalized clause. The verb of the nominal-
ized clause is fully inflected. These clauses, while marked with the possessive
clitic (as relative clauses are), are structurally different from relative clauses.
     Relative clauses modify NPs, and they occur in the modifier slot within an NP.
These nominalized clauses, on the contrary, while they share an argument with
their main clause, do not modify an NP but rather modify an entire main clause,
within the specific semantic domain of perception. The shared argument of the
clauses is expressed only once, in the main clause, while the nominalized clause
consists only of the nominalized predicate and any arguments.
     These are not complement clauses either, as the nominalized clause does not
function as an argument of the main clause, but rather as a modifier. This can
clearly be seen for example in (9-32b), in which it can’t be the case that the nomi-
nalized clause is functioning as an argument of the main clause. The main clause
verb has 3pl object marking, so the object must be the women, not the clause
describing them going into the forest.
     Other potential candidates for complement clauses, including constructions
of saying and telling, are expressed with verbal morphology involving indirect
commands (see Section 7.1.4).

            ‘I saw her going inside the house’In (9-34a) the main clause is Sopakyi Nik tatŋgɨn ‘Sopak saw Nik’, and the subor-
dinate perception clause mbor pokunŋa ‘[Nik] spearing the pig’. Thus the clause
structure as a whole is ‘Sopak saw Nik [spearing the pig]’. The clause is not mod-
ifying Nik, as it would be in a relative clause, but rather the perception clause
predicates what is perceived.

          ‘I didn’t know you (m) had come’9.8 Cosubordinate constructionsA further type of clause combining construction in Tayap consists of medial verbs
appearing with modifying suffixes and then linked to independent final verbs,
which are always verbs of motion. These are cosubordinate constructions, also
called clause chaining constructions: the terms are used interchangeably here.
     In these clauses, a medial verb appears in its irrealis or realis stem form,
without a subject marker, with an object marker if transitive, and one of three
linking suffixes: -ra (modifier), -kar (manner), or -rar (multiple), followed by an
independent verb. These structures form medial-final chains (Longacre 2007).
Van Valin and La Polla (1997) call this type of clause linkage cosubordination, i.e.
dependency without embedding.
     Nothing can occur between the medial verb and the final verb. Also such
clauses cannot contain cataphoric pronominal reference (i.e. cannot refer forward
to something in a later clause). So medial chains are not subordinate, but neither
are they coordinate as their medial verbs are dependent on the final verb of the
chain for status marking.
                                                       Cosubordinate constructions          275
     In all three types of clause chains, negation occurs once and has scope over
the whole construction.
     Tayap cosubordinate constructions differ from serial verb constructions in
that medial verbs have an obligatory linking suffix, whereas non-final verbs in
serial verb constructions do not, and serial verb constructions generally form
a single phonological word whereas cosubordinate constructions do not (see
Section 8.2 for discussion of serial verb constructions).
     One unusual facet of Tayap’s medial-final constructions is that they do not
typically form the long chains that Papuan languages in general are so famous
for. The majority of medial-final chains in Tayap consist of a single medial verb
followed by a final verb. This might be in part because the final verb has to be a
verb of motion.
     An alternative analysis of these constructions, in particular -r and -kar, is that
they are adverbial suffixes, rendering an adverb from a verb. However a cosubor-
dinate analysis is preferred here as negation operates across clause boundaries
to cover the whole construction rather than negating the putative adverb directly
(see below, Section 9.8.2).","[285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295]"

5.4.2.2 Future (fut)
Like the negative, the future is formed on the basis of the (irrealis) verb stem.

to the irrealis modal suffix that follows the verb stem.
     With transitive verbs, the irrealis subject suffix (Section 5.2.2) is added after
the irrealis object suffix.
     So future is formed in Tayap according to the following patterns:
 intransitive
                   irr verb stem + irr suffixes -ki, -kɨ or -ku + irr subject
 verbs transitive

The future encodes an unreal event, but also locates an event in time. It con-
trasts with the near future in terms of the action’s expected occurrence in rela-
tion to the moment of speaking: the near future is expected to occur soon in
relation to the moment of speaking; the future is expected to occur at some
other point in the future – a time that may or may not be specified by a temporal
adverb like ‘this evening’, ‘tomorrow’ or ‘later’.","[171, 172, 173]"

"
Even though these two sentences can be translated the same way in English, they
are not synonymous in Tayap. The first example is the unmarked construction:
it is a simple declarative sentence consisting of a transitive class 1 verb stem (po)
suffixed by a 3sg.f object morpheme denoting the pig (-ku) and a subject ending
(-n) denoting ‘he’, all inflected for realis.
      The second example is marked. It contains the same verb stem inflected for
realis, but instead of the object morpheme that refers to the pig that was shot,
what follows is a morpheme that means ‘mine’, ‘the one belonging to me’ or ‘the
one whose being shot had consequences for me’. Morphemes that encode this
relation often also encode the notion of benefit, and in keeping with other lin-
guistic work on Papuan languages (e.g. Foley 1991: 307–11), here they are labeled
“benefactive”, even if the label is not entirely satisfying, because the actions
encoded by the verb do not necessarily entail benefit. In (7-29a)–(7-29b) above, for
example, the spearing of my pig may be malefactive, and it may have happened
contrary to the speaker’s knowledge, will or desire.
      The ben morphemes highlight a relationship of possession and/or the con-
sequences that an action or event have on the person or thing denoted by the
morphemes. In (7-29a) and (7-29b) above, a relation of possession is expressed
                                                        Benefactive (ben)     219
in both examples, by means of the possessive pronoun ŋaŋan ‘my’. But while
possession is evident in the first example, it is emphasized in the second, partly
through the possessive pronoun (which can be omitted in this construction) and
partly through the benefactive morphology affixed to the verb stem.
    Benefactive morphemes often occur on a transitive verb like ‘give’. Here the
possessive meaning of ‘what belongs to me’ or ‘what should belong to me’ is
evident.(7-30) isia(ta)n

220         7 Mood         Note: adu ‘break’ is a class 3 transitive verb; hence the verb stem variation in these
         examples (7-31c and d; see Section 6.1.4)
Although as already noted, the benefactive morphemes do not necessarily carry
a positive meaning of benefit (something that is apparent from examples (7-31c –
7-31d) about bone-breaking), they often do express the meaning of doing some-
thing for the benefit of someone, even though it is often difficult in practice to
separate the sense of beneficiary from that of possession.
     A command like the following means both ‘Get rid of the rubbish that is in her
house’ and ‘Get rid of the house’s rubbish for her benefit’:(7-32)   patɨrŋa pipia aŋgo wostukwa(ta)n

         ‘get rid of this rubbish in her house‘; ‘get rid of this house’s rubbish for her’The following command is similar: it means both ‘Light my cigarette’ and ‘Light
my cigarette for me’.(7-33)   ŋaŋan sokoi wototia(ta)n
         ŋaŋan       sokoi       woto       -t -ia(ta)     -n
         1sg.poss cigarette light.irr -s <1sg.ben.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
         ‘light my cigarette’; ‘light my cigarette for me’Because they foreground a relationship of possession or one in which an agent
has been affected by an action or event, benefactive object morphemes can be
affixed to any verb stem – even an intransitive, stative verb like ‘be’.
     One old woman once told a story of how she upbraided her teenage son for
taking money out of her net bag without her permission. “Yesterday you cried for
me to give you money”, she recounted herself saying, “and I gave you two kina to
buy biscuits, which you bought and ate”1.
     After having established her prior generosity, the woman continued, saying
in a self-pitying voice:
1 The kina, from the Tok Pisin word for ‘clam’, is Papua New Guinea’s main unit of currency.
                                                                  Benefactive (ben)          221

       ‘my 3 kina is there’; i.e. it’s all I have leftHere the benefactive morphemes foreground the speaker as both possessing and
being directly affected by the presence of the three kina. Not only are her three
kina there; they are three kina that are there specifically for her benefit and use.
    Earlier, this same speaker, also talking about herself, said:(7-35)     saki tutor ŋayar kuka nda ikur sisiatan
           saki       tutor   ŋayar kuk               -a   nda ikur

222        7 MoodBecause benefactive morphemes are object/undergoer-like morphemes, they
occur in the expected object slot in a verb’s architecture, thus precluding the
appearance of the object marker. Note that a coreferential NP can appear with
the object marker: see for example (7-37a) below. And like the other object mor-
phemes that have been discussed and exemplified throughout this grammar, the
benefactive object morphemes are marked as either realis or irrealis.
    The forms of the benefactive object marker can be compared to those of the
(non-benefactive) object morphemes:         non-benefactive object     benefactive object

express expectation, supposition and surprise. Two of these particles – awa and
mera – occur with both verbs and other parts of speech. Kapa modifies only
nouns and adjectives and nímera occurs with only verbs.","[238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243]"

able to host realis/irrealis status and transitivity suffixes as well as subject and
object suffixes. A fully inflected verb can function as the sole word of a sentence.
    There are two major subclasses of verbs: intransitive and transitive. Examples
of each are:Intransitive verb(3-28) ŋgu pirok
       ŋgu     pirok
       3sg.f laugh.sg.f|1sg.pl.r

       1sg=erg.f 2sg see.r -s <2sg.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
       ‘I saw you’There are no ditransitive verbs in Tayap (see also Section 9.1). Semantically three-
place predicates express the recipient of giving, for example, with the benefactive
morpheme:(3-30) is        -iata        -n
       give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r
       ‘(you) give it to me!’However the recipient can be omitted, indicating that the verb in question is tran-
sitive, not ditransitive, and that the benefactive morpheme is an optional oblique
argument:(3-31) epi           i           -kru       -net
       tomorrow give.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
       ‘I (m) will give it (to someone) tomorrow’Benefactive objects and regular objects cannot coocur in the same clause.
     As well as being divided into transitivity classes, every Tayap verb falls
into one of nine conjugation classes, based on how verbs form their non-future
forms: there are five classes for transitive verbs and four for intransitives (see
Chapter 6).
     Verb morphology in Tayap is entirely suffixing, with morphemes for object
and subject added – in that order, apart from discontinuous subject markers – to
verb stems. A characteristic feature of Tayap verbs is that status is marked across
the verb multiple times. The stem must occur in either an irrealis or realis form.
In addition, the object and subject morphemes that get suffixed to the stem also
encode realis/irrealis status.
     This can be illustrated with an example from the transitive verb stem o, which
means ‘strike’ (and covers actions like ‘shoot’, ‘stab’ and ‘hit’). Note how irrealis
vs. realis is marked across the verb (in bold):
                                                                                Verbs   65

           ‘(Any pronoun, person or number of people) didn’t get up’ (or ‘won’t
           get up’)Status2marking on verbs, while mandatory, does not always occur in predictable
ways. Realis morphemes can occur as part of a verb that refers to an unreal event.
An example is the counterfactual mood (cf), which is a prototypical irrealis cate-
gory, because it refers to events that never occurred, such as ‘If he had seen it, he
would have shot it’. However in Tayap, on transitive verbs, the counterfactual is2 Note that the negative verb requires irrealis marking, see Section 5.4.2.1.

as counterfactual and suffixed by group I subject morphemes, which in this
grammar – for the sake of consistency with the pattern that is clear in transitive
verbs – are glossed as realis. In reality, though, group I subject morphemes are
the same in the realis and irrealis statuses (see Section 6.2.1).(3-35) memrɨknet

tion to draw attention to or emphasize the word they follow. So an angry shout
of ayáta! ‘enough!’ followed by the word kai expresses stronger disapproval than
ayáta without the kai.
     A second group of words function as ways for speakers to do things like plan
discourse, stress particular constituents, hedge and change topics.
     Tayap’s intensifiers and discourse markers are as follows

3.11.2 Discourse markersŋgo      carries the sense of ‘well then’ or ‘in that case’ (cf. Tok Pisin:
         “pastaim”), e.g.:(3-97) Speaker A:

         go.sbj -2sg.m.r dm
         ‘Go, then/in that case’ndɨ      discourse marker that draws attention to the noun phrase that precedes
         it. It conveys the gentle nuance that whatever precedes it is known
         or should be known by the addressee. Its meaning therefore extends
         from what one might translate as ‘you know’, ‘right’ or ‘so’, to more
         exasperated nuances like ‘in case you weren’t paying attention’ or ‘you
         perhaps don’t know, but now I’m telling you’. An example expressing
         impatience is as follows:(3-98) tukur non      ndɨ we                -tak
       rain some dm come.sbj                -2sg.f.r
       ‘Come on rain, come!’Another typical example that acknowledges previously conveyed information,
and that also might be interpreted as displaying some impatience, is the following:
(3-99)   Speaker A: ŋa kebis katɨpkrunetana
                    ŋa kebis

                   ‘So cut it then’        When ndɨ occurs in a sentence that has at least one verb inflected in
        the counterfactual mood, it also functions syntactically as a marker of
        subordination (see Section 9.4.2).nda    discourse marker that is likely a reduced form of the deictic morpheme
       ainda (see Section 3.8). Used like ndɨ to draw attention to the noun or noun
       phrase that precedes it, and often carries a sense similar to English ‘then’:(3-100) mboka ŋa nda numbwan aproyi tatin
        mbok           -a   ŋa nda numbwan apro =yi
        go.1sg.f|1pl.r -and 1sg dm thought bad =erg.f        ta     -t -i         -n
        get.r -s <1sg.r.o> -2sg.|.f3sg.f|1pl.r.s
        ‘we went along and then a bad thought occurred to me’ (lit. ‘a bad
        thought got me’)In a way that is similar to and probably related to the pragmatic function of
Tayap’s deictic words (see Section 3.8), discourse markers frequently occur multi-
ple times in a single sentence, as in the following:(3-101) a. ŋa ndɨ nda namnak Ŋgemanŋi mera
           ŋa ndɨ nda nam -nak                  Ŋgeman =ŋi mera

           ‘Well you all, I really don’t know anything about that pig’3.12 Mood particlesTayap has four freestanding words that express expectation (awa), supposition
(mera), mirative (kapa) and surprise counter to expectation (nímera). These are
discussed in Section 7.6.
4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers,
  case marking and possession4.1 IntroductionNoun phrases function as arguments of verbs: A, S, O and peripheral roles. Noun
phrase function is expressed with clitics marking A. O and S arguments are
unmarked, and oblique arguments are marked by clitics.
     This chapter first discusses noun phrase structure, with a discussion of mod-
ifiers of the head noun. This is followed by a discussion of each case marker:
ergative, locative, ablative, perlative and dative. After this comes a description of
possession in Tayap. Young people’s Tayap is discussed in relation to ergativity
(Section 4.3.2) and peripheral case markers (Section 4.6).","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"Grammatical words generally coincide with phonological words in Tayap
(however see Section 8.2, example (8–3) for a counter-example). Grammatical
words consist of “a number of grammatical elements which (i) always occur
together rather than scattered throughout the clause (…); (ii) occur in fixed order;
and (iii) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning” (Aikhenvald 2007: 2).
     In Tayap, verbs are grammatical words which minimally must always occur
with person and/or status marking except in certain restricted morphosyntac-
tic environments. Even the longest and most complex of the complex predicates
described in Chapters 8 and 9 consist of single grammatical words, sharing as they
do various properties like marking for arguments and/or realis/irrealis status. Thus
the example discussed in detail in Chapter 8, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, ‘she intends to
carry him down on her shoulders’, is a single phonological and grammatical word.
     However grammatical words do not necessarily have to be inflected. Verbs
are normally inflected, but nouns, pronouns, particles and other minor classes
can occur without inflection.
                                                               Orthography        45
2.8 OrthographyThe Tayap orthography in this grammar and dictionary uses letters of the English
alphabet that correspond to the language’s phonemes, with two exceptions: ɨ
and ŋ. The phonemes /ɵ/ and /ŋ/ would be difficult to render using the letters
used to write English or Tok Pisin. Tayap is almost never written, and any villager
who does so invents his or her own nonce orthography. In my years of contact with
the villagers, I have received many letters from them, always written in Tok Pisin.
At the very end of these letters, though, after the writer has finished asking me for
money (which is always the sole reason for sending me a letter), he or she often
concludes with a line written in Tayap, to add coercive punch to the requests.
     A typical example is the phrase Aowo grag engon yu na na, which occurred at
the very end of a letter that had just instructed me to send the writer the equiva-
lent of $8,000 (at a time when the yearly income for the entire village was about
$500). The interjection aowo is an orthographic rendering of a sound used by
villagers to convey worry and longing, and the rest, ‘good evening to you’, is a
Tayap calque of Tok Pisin’s “gutpela apinun long yu”. The unambiguous meaning
of the Tayap phrase is: ‘I worry about you, so now you worry about me and send
me eight thousand dollars’.
     The orthography that villagers have come up with to write Tayap varies from
writer to writer and from occasion to occasion. However, one convention that has
developed over the years regards /ɵ/, which is sometimes written as h, and /ŋ/,
which is often rendered as either nh or ngh. This convention may be the invention
of Amburi Waiki, who was in his late twenties and the village prayer leader in the
mid-1980s. Amburi was the only person in Gapun to write anything in Tayap at
that time, and his orthography – which he himself applied erratically – was seen
by others and perhaps adopted by them. (What Amburi wrote on loose pages and
in school workbooks were the names of villagers who had contributed money to
the village church, and the names of areas of rainforest that he wanted to note
down for various reasons.)
     This way of handling Tayap’s phonemes results in a sentence like the follow-
ing, which Amburi wrote down for me in the 1980s: Ngha nghing ana mbet (‘I have
come for them’).
     The problem with the orthography used to write this sentence is that it is
difficult for villagers to parse and read. It makes no distinction between free and
bound morphemes (-ana, ‘for’ or ‘to’, for example, is a bound morpheme that
cannot occur on its own), and literate villagers, who have learned to read by being
drilled in school with texts in English, have difficulty with the sheer number of
letters used to denote simple sounds. (In the orthography used in this grammar
and dictionary the sentence would be written Ŋa ŋgɨnana mbet.)
46        2 Phonology and orthography      A sentence produced in 2009 by a literate villager who I asked to demonstrate
to me how he would write something in Tayap shows that the same problems
have persisted: Nhang nhan patir engon nhayar (‘My house is very nice’). The
orthography is internally inconsistent – the word written engon is pronounced
[εŋgɔn], and thus should be written enhgon, if the conventions of this orthogra-
phy were followed consistently.
      This orthography also quickly gets messy. For example, in the sentence just
quoted, a common word like ŋaŋan (‘my’) is written as two words and spelled
nhang nhan. In other instances, simple pronouns like ŋɨ [ŋɵ] (‘he’) and ŋgɨ [ŋgɵ]
(‘they’) tend to stump village writers, who might write them as nghi and nghgh,
respectively – although they would more likely avoid writing them or give up
trying to write them.
      Words with the consonant cluster /ŋg/ also pose difficulties. A name like
‘Saŋgi’ – which the villagers’ orthography should render as something like
Sanhgi – looks strange to the villagers when they see it written out in this way
(they would in this case write ‘Sangi’). Worse, a name like ‘Saŋgiŋgi’, which
might be written something like Sanhginhgi, would make villagers who try to use
their invented orthography throw up their hands in despair.
      Because of those difficulties, which villagers perceive and talk about them-
selves, I do not adopt their orthographic inventions to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/. Instead, I
introduce two additional letters, ɨ and ŋ. These letters are ordered so that ɨ follows
i in the alphabet, and ŋ follows n.
      While I depart from the villagers’ attempts to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/, I do follow
their loose convention of orthographically marking prenasalization on the voiced
word-initial stops /b/ and /d/ and on the affricate /dʒ/. Villagers vary on whether
or not they orthographically mark word-initial nasalization on the velar stop
/g/: a word like ‘cassowary’, spelled ŋgat in this orthography, would probably be
written ngat by most villagers.
      On the other hand, though, some of them write ŋgrag ‘evening’ as grag (see
above, the example of a villager’s letter asking me for $8,000). Regardless of how
they would write a word-initial /g/, however, Tayap speakers consistently prena-
salize the phoneme when they pronounce it in this position. Hence, I mark this
in the orthography.
      This concession to village pronunciation and writing conventions means that
the orthography used here is not as economical as it otherwise might have been.
I could have omitted the nasalization in words beginning with /b/, /d/, /j/ and
/g/ and simply noted that those phonemes are all obligatorily nasalized word-
initially (this is what Christopher Stroud and I did in our 1993 sketch grammar).
      In the end, though, I decided that since the only people who might conceiv-
ably ever actually use the orthography employed here are the speakers of Tayap,
                                                                 Orthography        47
their perceptual biases and already-established habits were more important than
an economical orthography. As I just noted, villagers who write anything in Tayap
vary in whether or not they mark the prenasalization before a word-initial /g/. But
they would find it counter-intuitive and odd to see or write bor ‘pig’, je ‘dog’ or der
‘path’ when they say – and would write – mbor, nje and nder.
     I therefore write words the way the villagers pronounce them, with the result
that there are no words in the dictionary that begin orthographically with b, d, j
or g.
     Word-medial and word-final prenasalized consonants are written as they are
most commonly pronounced, thus the j in munje ‘man’ is written as prenasalized,
as it is normally pronounced, versus mbubujiram ‘bubbles from fish, crocodiles,
turtles emerging from underwater’, which is written unprenasalized.
     This orthographic convention would also logically entail changing the spell-
ing of the villagers’ home, Gapun, to Ŋgapun. However, ‘Gapun’ is not a Tayap
word. Senior men in the 1980s told me that they had heard that Germans had
given the name Gapun to their village – which is called Tayap num ‘Tayap village’
in Tayap.
     No one knows why ‘Gapun’ was chosen, but the most likely explanation is
that when German cartographers and labor recruiters first appeared in the lower
Sepik area in the early decades of the 1900s, they asked coastal villagers the
names of inland villages which they could not reach, and they wrote down some
version of the names they received in response. The Kopar-language name for
Gapun, for example, is Saŋgap.
     No great leap of imagination is required to see how a name like that, through
various mis-hearings and confusions, could end up as Gapun. A significant per-
centage of the colonial records from the lower Sepik area were destroyed during
WWII, so I have been unable to uncover any information that directly sheds light
on the question of why Gapun is called Gapun.
     But whatever the story behind the German naming of the village may be, the
spelling of ‘Gapun’ can remain unchanged, since it is not a Tayap word.
     Note that stress is marked where it is a property of a lexical morpheme (for
example, wákare (‘no’), but in the rest of the grammar it is not marked it when it
is a product of complex morpho-phonemics e.g. like kakúndara in (2-14a) above.
     Out of respect for villagers’ writing habits (and also to be consistent with the
analysis of the language’s phonology discussed above, where no VVV clusters
are permitted), I have also changed the spelling of the name of the language and
people from Taiap – as I have spelled it in all my previous work on Gapun – to
Tayap.
     Whenever villagers write their name for themselves, they always spell it
Tayap. And the word is a popular one to write. The front of one house near the
48        2 Phonology and orthographycenter of the village, for example, is adorned with large letters, painted in black
battery acid, that proclaims (tellingly, in Tok Pisin), NIU LUK TAYAP (‘New Look
Tayap’).
     Another young man, upping the linguistic ante in the direction of what many
villagers have understood is the even more prestigious language, used similar
material to paint the words NEW HOME TAYAP on a wall in his house.
     A young man with whom I was walking along the beach one day, making
the six-hour trip to the village of Watam to see if the local health worker there
had any medicine for a bad case of scabies I had acquired in the village (she
didn’t), paused at one point to scratch the words NICK OUTCAST PERSON K*B*H*
ROR TAYAP MUNJE into the sand. Translated, this means ‘Nick outcast person
K[ambedagam] B[lue] H[ill] child Tayap man’ – the K*B*H* part of the message
being a name the young villagers have given to their mountain.
     Nick’s scribble in the sand doesn’t make much sense in either of the two lan-
guages in which it is written. But that is typical of the way that the word Tayap is
used in young villagers’ writing: it is used more as a marker or a tag than as an
attempt to convey referential meaning. Nick’s writing is a slightly more elaborate
variant of the words Tayap ror (Tayap child), which is a popular tag that young
men and women like to carve into trees or add after their signature at the end of
a love letter. The words are modeled on the Tok Pisin word “mangi”, which used
to mean ‘child’, but which during the past thirty years has acquired the sassier
meaning of ‘young person’ or, better, ‘kid’.
3 Word classesTayap has two open classes of words – nouns (Section 3.1) and verbs (Section 3.2) –

116       4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionFor those reasons, ŋɨ ŋgat poŋgɨn can potentially be understood to mean either
‘he speared the cassowary (with a spear)’ or ‘the cassowary struck him’ (that is,
pierced his body with the knife-like claws on its feet).
    Using the ergative case marker resolves ambiguity by marking the transitive

yet an ergative marker is used:(4-32) mbumjorŋi minjikankɨ nda kokɨr kukupemiet
       mbumjor=ŋi              minjikan -kɨ                nda     kokɨr

       bring -3sg.f.r.o rise_up.sg.m.r
       ‘the snake raised his head really close’One verb that virtually always marks its subject with the ergative clitic is kiraw-
when it conveys the meaning of ‘know’ (this verb also has a range of other
meanings, including ‘consider something’, ‘recognize something’ and ‘taste
something’); note that this example has the unusual structure of a preposed
head, with possessive phrase following.

           ‘He saw Akupi [’s spirit]’4.3.1.1 Ergative clitics on intransitive verbs
The main function of ergative clitics is to mark the subject of a transitive verb.
In Tayap, however, the ergative marker can also be attached to the subject of an
intransitive verb.
     This marked use often carries a particular nuance, which can be illustrated
by an example taken from a narrative about a powerful crocodile water-spirit
named Ŋgayam. In telling this story, the narrator uses the ergative with an intran-
sitive verb:(4-35) Ŋgayamŋi mbet
       Ŋgayam =ŋi    mbet
       Ŋgayam =erg.m come.3sg.m.r
       ‘Ŋgayam came’
118       4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThe ergative here carries the connotation of purposefulness. The implication
is that Ŋgayam didn’t just come – he came with a purpose, to do something, to
perform some kind of action. And indeed he did: the story tells of how Ŋgayam
flooded the rainforest and drowned an entire kin group as they stood gathering
his children – who had the form of fish – in his jungle streams. A version of this
story appears at the end of this grammar as Tayap Text 2.
     Another telling instance of an ergative marker on an intransitive verb
occurred once when men from the neighboring village of Sanae arrived in
Gapun unannounced a few days after one of their relatives had been attacked
by a Gapuner. Everyone in Gapun was fearful of the Sanae men, because it was
assumed that they had come to fatally bewitch the attacker or one of his matri-
lineal relatives. As the Sanae men arrived in Gapun, villagers whispered to one
another:(4-36) Merewŋgrogi ŋgwek
       Merew -ŋgro =gi           ŋgwek
       Sanae -pl       =erg.pl come.3pl.r
       ‘the Sanae [men] are coming’The use of the ergative in this case meant that the Sanae men were not just drop-
ping by Gapun on an innocent visit to socialize. They were coming to accomplish
a particular sinister purpose.
    This use of the ergative to mark intentionality on intransitive verbs is also
apparent in cases where the ergative is used to denote a remarked-upon lack of
intentionality. The following example was uttered by a woman screaming abuse
at her relatives because her nephew littered the ground in front of her house with
seeds he blew from a homemade pea-shooter (i.e. in front of the house of the
woman having the “kros”, see Kulick 1992: 104–113 and Kulick 1993 for details on
these kinds of antagonistic speech events):(4-37) yumŋni mburaiakaku wákare!
       yum =ŋi          mburai     -ak           aku       wákare
       2pl =erg.m sweep.irr -link                be.irr    neg
       ‘you all never sweep!’Here the ergative clitic on an intransitive verb (mburai ‘sweep’) inflected in the
negative habitual aspect (see Section 8.3.2) highlights the consistent lack of
intention on the part of her addressees to perform an act that she thinks they
ought to consider doing occasionally.
                                                     The ergative case (erg)    119
    Suter’s (2010) description of optional ergativity in the Trans New Guinea
language Kâte shows that the ergative marker is most likely to be used in
clauses with the marked word order of OSV (as opposed to the usual SOV) or
when a focus particle is used on the subject (Suter 2010: 435). In other Trans
New Guinea languages, factors include animacy, agency and control (Suter
2010: 436).
    As we have seen, however, there seems to be no single factor or group of
factors which account for the use or absence of the ergative marker in Tayap.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"
"These could also be analyzed as jussives as described above without ŋganokaw,
thus “Let the teachers piss off. Let Nelson go too”.
    Negative indirect commands, like ‘I didn’t tell Mbawi to go’, are formed by
negating the main verb (note that it is intransitive) and suffixing the verb in the
subordinate clause with the intentional suffix (see Section 7.4 for discussion of
how the intentional suffix is used):(7-17) a. Sakeyi namkɨ wákare Kunji eŋgrɨnana

"7.6.1 Expectation and impatience (exp)The particle awa, which occurs initially or in the case of (7-39), after the subject,
carries a connotation of expectation tinged with slight or potential impatience or
disapproval. In the 1980s, senior men translated some occurrences of awa for me
with the Tok Pisin word “watpo” (‘what for’). “Watpo” is a demand that one can
easily imagine being shouted at black plantation workers by white colonial over-
seers. In the speech of the senior Gapun men, it was an interrogative that retained
an aggressive or exasperated tone that didn’t so much mean ‘why?’ as it meant,
‘Why in the world…? or ‘Why the hell…?’.
224           7 Mood    By 2009, awa was rarely heard in Tayap speech, and the instances of the word I
heard in the speech of senior villagers did not express overt disapproval. However,
they did seem to indicate that what was being referred to was anticipated or
overdue. So note the difference in meaning between two sentences, one of which
uses the simple interrogative, and the other which uses the modal particle awa:(7-38) a.      Speaker A:    wek-ara
                             come.3sg.f.r-perf
                             ‘she has arrived’               Speaker B:    Ndamor=ke?
                             Ndamor=q
                             ‘who, Ndamor?         b.    Speaker A:    wek-ara
                             come.3sg.f.r-perf
                             ‘she has arrived’               Speaker B:    Ndamor awa?
                             Ndamor exp
                             ‘it must be Ndamor?’Another example occurred when an old woman was waiting for a piece of meat
to be heated on a fire. At one point during a conversation about other things, she
asked a girl who was looking after the meat:(7-39)   ŋgu      awa mborsip tandiu pipiek?
         3sg.f exp pork          well cook.3sg.f.r
         ‘is the pork cooked enough?’Once again, this question is not simply a request for information; it expresses an
expectation. In the next example, given to me by a senior man in the 1980s, men
in Gapun were ready to fight men from the neighboring village of Sanae. All pre-
pared to fight, the Gapun men could ask one another in anticipatory excitement:(7-40) awa ŋgɨ ai                -ki   -ndak?
       exp 3pl come.irr -irr -3pl.irr
       ‘Will they come?’; i.e. ‘Do you think they’ll really come?’
                                                                    Mood particles          225
When it occurs together with a negated verb, the sense of expectation is height-
ened. Contrast the following two sentences:(7-41)   a. awa mbet
            exp come.r.1sg.m|3sg.m.r
            ‘he should come’ (i.e. ‘I expect he will come’)         a. awa ai-ki              wákare
            exp come.irr-irr neg
            ‘he must have arrived’Because it carries a sense of expectation, this construction is similar in meaning
to the admonitive mood discussed in Section 7.3. For example, the following two
sentences both mean something similar:(7-42)   a. awa Kemma orasambgi nirru wákare
            awa Kem =ma      ora      samb =gi
            exp Kem =poss thing pl            =erg.pl                nir         -ru        wákare
                make.irr -2sg.irr.o neg
                ‘it must be Kem’s things [i.e. his connections with the spirit world]
                that are making you sick’ (in Tok Pisin: “Nogut ol samting bilong Kem
                i mekim yu”)         b. Kemma orasambgi nirŋgarana
            Kem =ma         ora    samb =gi           nir          -ŋgarana
            Kem =poss thing pl             =erg.pl make.irr -adm.sg|1pl
            ‘it wouldn’t be good if it’s Kem’s things [i.e. his connections with the
            spirit world] that are making you sick’ (same Tok Pisin translation as
            above).22 This example is marked by non-agreement between the plural noun (orasamb, ‘things’) and
the plural ergative morpheme (=gi) affixed to the noun, and the singular inflection (-ŋgarana) on
the verb ‘make’ (nir). One would expect the plural ending –ŋgroana ( so ‘nirŋgroana’ see Section
7.3).
    It is probable that this example takes the form it does because the plural noun orak samb
(‘things’) is usually treated as a singular entity. So speakers say:     ŋgan orasamb wuk aŋgi
     ŋgan        orak      samb     wuk           aŋgi
     3pl.poss    thing     pl       be.3sg.f.r    dx
     ‘their things are there’ (lit. ‘their things is there’)
226         7 MoodAlthough they clearly are not identical in meaning, sentences like these two both
express an anxiety in relation to, or an expectation about, an event.","[243, 244, 245, 246]"

9.3 Coordinated clauses9.3.1 Coordinated clauses with conjunctive –(y)a (‘and’)The simplest way to link verbs in Tayap is to add a conjunctive morpheme -a (real-
ized as -ya after a vowel) glossed as ‘and’ to fully inflected verbs that occur in a
series. Verbs linked in this manner express sequentiality: X happened, then Y
happened, then Z happened, and so on.
    For example:(9-8) a. Konjab adɨmbota sindineta turonɨ siniet
         Konjab adɨmbot       -a     sindi -net        -a
         Konjab trip.sg.m.r -and slip.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r -and           turo =nɨ      siniet
           slope =loc go_down.sg.m.r
           ‘Konjab tripped, lost his footing and slid down the slope’        b. yu urekteta raretet!
           yu urek         -tet    -a rare     -tet
           2sg turn.sbj -2sg.m.r -and look.sbj -2sg.m.r
           ‘turn around and look!’All the clauses linked together in this way are independent clauses. For example:(9-9)      mbuspimbroya nda ŋgɨ prɨke

             -and come.irr -irr -and 1sg =all sell.irr -3sg.f.irr.o neg
             ‘he didn’t go and buy betel nut and come and sell it to me’Note that in both examples in (9-10), even though the negating word wákare
appears only once, the scope of negation covers all verbs, and all verbs appear in
the irrealis form that they take when negated:      ai-ki
      come.irr-irr
      apu-kru
      cook.irr-3sg.f.irr.o      o-kɨ
      go.irr-irr                             wákare

      come.irr-irr
      mbudji-kru
      sell.irr-3sg.f.irr.o
However, the scope of negation can also cover just the final independent clause:
see below, example (9-11c).
     Note that these structures are considered to be series of independent coor-
dinated clauses. It is possible to consider them as single complex predications,
particularly as the scope of negation can cover the whole coordinated series. But
an analysis of coordinated clauses is preferred here, since each of the verbs is
a fully inflected independent verb, which can take its own overt NP arguments
as individual clauses do, and which can stand on its own. In addition, there is
an overt linker joining the clauses, making an analysis of a single predicate less
viable (Haspelmath 2016: 296).
     It is also possible to consider these sequences as medial-final chaining
(cosubordinate) constructions (Longacre 2007: 398). However, the non-final verbs
receive the full range of inflections, as do the final verbs. In medial-final chains
the non-final verbs are cosubordinate (see below, Section 9.8). For those reasons
it seems best to treat these sequences as independent coordinated clauses.
     Coordinate clauses do not have to share subjects, and as examples (9-11c
and d) show, they can be independently negated:

           ‘they didn’t push me and I fell in the water’All these examples contain separate clauses, each one headed by fully inflected
independent verbs. The first two examples express a sequential relationship
between the actions: they pushed me and then I fell (9-11a); the woman saw the
man, and then the two of them chased the pig, and then the man speared the
pig (9-11b). This relationship of sequentiality is the most common implication of
clauses joined with -a.
256        9 Simple and complex sentences   But as (9-11c) shows, -a can also coordinate clauses that express a simulta-
neous rather than sequential relationship between the actions: Kama carried the
water and while she was carrying it, none of it spilled.","[272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"
"1.6 Tayap linguistic profileLike many Sepik languages, Tayap is a synthetic language. Verbs are the most
elaborated area of the grammar. They are complex, fusional and massively sup-
pletive, with opaque verbal morphology including unpredictable conjugation
classes, both in terms of membership and formal marking. There are very many
suppletive stem forms marking a basic realis-irrealis distinction as well as various
other TAM categories. Person/number marking also differs depending on the verb
type. This is a language of “baroque accretions” (McWhorter 2001); or what Dahl
(2004) calls “mature phenomena”.
     There is a fundamental distinction in verbal morphology between realis and
irrealis stems and suffixes, but this distinction is overridden by transitivity in the
prohibitive and counterfactual forms.
     Grammatical relations are marked by verbal suffixes, which distinguish
S/A versus O. In some conjugations S/A is marked by discontinuous mor-
phemes. Free pronouns and noun phrases mark the ergative case (A) compared
to unmarked forms for the absolutive (S/O). As in many Papuan languages
which have an ergative case, the ergative marker is optional and is frequently
omitted.
     There are two genders, masculine and feminine, marked not on the noun
itself but on deictics, the ergative marker, suppletive verbal stems and verbal
affixes. The unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including animate nouns,
even humans, is feminine: however, a male referent may be masculine. Another
criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be masculine;
short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine. Again this type of gender-
assignment system is typical of the Sepik region.
     Gender is only ever marked in the singular, never in the dual or plural. Nouns
generally do not mark number themselves, although there is a small class of
largely human nouns which mark plural, and a smaller class which mark dual.
These categories, where marked, are largely marked by partial or full supple-
tion. Oblique cases, largely local, are marked by clitics attached to the end of the
oblique NP. Two adjectives also mark number, with partially suppletive forms for
singular, dual and plural. A further two adjectives have partially suppletive forms
for singular and plural.
26        1 The Tayap language and its speakers     Phonologically, the language has a medium-sized consonant inventory with
voiceless stops, voiced (prenasalized) stops, nasals, semivowels and a rhotic/
lateral flap. There are six vowels, /a/, /i/, /ɛ/, /u/, /ɔ/ and /ɵ/. Stress is largely pre-
dictable, typically word final but occasionally occurring elsewhere in the word.
     The expression of possession is relatively simple: a possessor is marked with
a clitic, and there are no subcategories of possession.
     There are two kinds of complex predicate, which can be distinguished
morpho-syntactically: serial verb constructions; and complex predicates formed
with the verb ‘to be’, which consist of progressives and habituals. There are three
types of complex clause: coordinate, cosubordinate (medial-final clause chains)
and subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses consist of relative clauses, adver-
bial clauses, and perception constructions, as well as finite nominalizations.

"5.2 Standard negation in transitive and intransitive verbs5.2.1 Negation of transitive verbsIn order to understand what happens to a Tayap verb when it is negated, compare
the following forms of the transitive verb ‘consume’ in the non-future and future
tense:

         ‘they will eat pork’
Leaving aside everything else that is happening with this verb, look at the
verb stem. Note that the stem changes between the non-future tense, where it
appears as both ka (for 1sg, 2sg, 3sg.m and for 1pl subjects) and o (for 3sg.f
and 3pl subjects), and the future, where the stem is realized as a for every
subject.
     This being the case, how does one know whether the verb root of ‘eat’ is ka or
o or a, or something else entirely?
     This becomes clear when the verb is negated. Negation strips a verb of
everything but its irrealis stem and an irrealis object suffix (for transitive verbs),
or its irrealis stem and a marker of status (for intransitive verbs).

          3pl =ergpl pork            consume.irr -3sg.f.irr.o neg
          ‘they won’t eat pork’Note that ‘didn’t eat’ (i.e. an event that did not occur in the past) and ‘won’t eat’
(an action that will not occur in the future) are expressed with the same form, a,
in Tayap. This is the reason this form is classified as irrealis: both the future and
the negated forms of verbs are unreal events. The actions they express have either
not yet happened (the future) or they have not happened or will not happen (the
negated forms).
    This invariant form of the verb stem in negation is a verb’s root form.
    Note that the negator wákare usually appears clause finally (but see e.g.
examples (8-27d and 9.14b)). This feature of Tayap is common to many Papuan
and Austronesian languages (Reesink 2002b).

5.2.2 Negation of intransitive verbsJust like transitive verbs, intransitive verbs also reveal their root forms when
negated. To see this, look at the full conjugation in the non-future and future
tenses of the irregular verb of motion ‘go’:

      go.irr -irr negIn other words, ‘I didn’t go’, ‘they didn’t go’, ‘we won’t go’, ‘she will not go’, etc. –
all this becomes okɨ wákare.
     As in transitive verbs, the form of the verb that appears in negation is the verb
root.
     An intransitive verb takes no object suffix. In negation, however, intransitive
verbs exhibit a morphological structure that parallels the transitive object suffix.
A negated intransitive verb signals irrealis status in both the verb stem and in the
suffix that follows it. This irrealis suffix suffixed to the verb stem further marks it as
irrealis.
     The irrealis suffix suffixed to the verb stem is the same for all subjects, regard-
less of person, gender or number. Note that it occurs in contexts apart from just
negation, see for example (5-9a).
     The suffix occurs in one of three forms: -ki, -kɨ or -ku. There is some phonetic
regularity in the patterning of which verb stems take which suffixes: verb stems
that contain or end in front vowels tend to take -ki or -kɨ, and verb stems that
                           Standard negation in transitive and intransitive verbs     143
contain or end in back vowels tend to take -ku. All the verbs that take -ki are verbs
of motion or end in the same stem form as the verb ai ‘come’. But like much else
in Tayap, none of this is entirely predictable. All verbs suffixed by irrealis -ki, for
example, may be verbs of motion or verbs that end with -ai. But not all verbs of
motion take -ki. And there are many exceptions to the front vowel/back vowel
pattern.","[158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163]"

4.2 Participles with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)garThe suffix -(ŋ)gar forms a participle, consisting of a verb stem plus the non-finite
suffix (ŋ)gar (realized as -gar after nd, t and sometimes r). Nouns formed with the
-(ŋ)gar suffix are attributes: they denote a habitual, stative or agentive quality.
Note this suffix is also used in counterfactuals (Section 9.4.3).
108        4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession(4-12) a. munje wasowŋgar aram
          munje    wasow    -ŋgar              aram
          man      die.irr  -nfn.sg            snake
          ‘poisonous snake’       b. morasi apro nirŋgar munje
          morasi     apro     nir      -ŋgar       munje
          habit      bad      do.irr   -nfn.sg     man
          ‘bad man’ (lit. ‘man who does bad things’)In both the examples above, the participle formed with -(ŋ)gar carries the
meaning of habituality: the snake is (always) venomous; the man is someone who
is known for habitually doing bad things. These constructions also express agen-
tive nominalizations – i.e. expressions like ‘killer of men’ or ‘doer of bad things’.
So a sentence like the following:(4-13) yu yimbar andurgar
       yu     yimbar    andur             -gar
       2sg    canoe     carve.irr         -nfn.sgmeans both ‘you carve canoes’ (often or habitually) and ‘you are a canoe carver’;
that is, the fact that you carve canoes is a characteristic by which other people
know you.
    The same is true of the following sentence:(4-14) ŋa sokoi aŋgar
       ŋa     sokoi         a                   -ŋgar
       1sg    tobacco       consume.irr         -nfn.sgThis can be translated both as the habitual ‘I smoke’ (in the sense of smoking
regularly or habitually) and as the stative ‘I am a smoker’ (as opposed to being a
non-smoker).
     The suffix-(ŋ)gar takes no TAM marking, even though it occurs in a position
after the verb stem that normally would be filled with an irr suffix (for intransi-
tive verbs) or an object suffix inflected for TAM (for transitive verbs). The follow-
ing sentence illustrates:(4-15) munje kowot inde ŋɨ             nɨpɨs Merew =re o -ŋgar
       man      old    dx.m 3sg.m able Sanae =all go.irr -nfn.sg
       ‘the old man is able to go to Sanae’
                                                      The ergative case (erg)     109
Even though the nfn suffix does not inflect for TAM, it does inflect to express
person and number, according to the following pattern:
           singular    dual     plural1          -ŋgar       -ŋgre    -ŋgar
2          -ŋgar       -ŋgrem   -ŋgrem
3sg.m/f    -ŋgar       -ŋgre    -ŋgro
Thus, one says:(4-16)    ŋgɨ    kakau           tow           -ŋgro
          3pl cocoa (TP)         plant.irr     -nfn.3pl
          ‘they plant cocoa’ (generally, habitually); ‘they are cocoa planters’(4-17)    ŋɨ        kakau           tow           -ŋgar
          3sg.m     cocoa (TP)      plant.irr     -nfn.sg|1pl
          ‘he plants cocoa’ (generally, habitually); ‘he is a cocoa planter’Because these constructions are nominalizations and not verbs, they do not
negate like verbs. They are non-verbal predications. All one does to negate them
is add the negator wákare (see Section 5.2).
     So compare:(4-18)    a.   ŋgɨ sokoi aŋgro
               ŋgɨ    sokoi       a                   -ŋgro
               3pl tobacco        consume.irr         -nfn.3pl
               ‘they smoke’; ‘they are smokers’          b.   ŋgɨ sokoi aŋgro wákare
               ŋgɨ    sokoi      a                -ŋgro        wákare
               3pl tobacco consume.irr -nfn.3pl                neg
               ‘they don’t smoke’; ‘they are not smokers’4.3 The ergative case (erg)Tayap optionally marks the subject (A) of a transitive verb with an ergative
case clitic, on noun phrases and free personal pronouns (note that subject and
object verbal pronominal suffixes follow a nominative-accusative system, see
Section 5.3).
110           4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession      Note the difference in the first word of the following two sentences:(4-19) a. Sopak wokara
          Sopak       wok                      -ara
          Sopak-Ø     go.3sg.f.r               -perf
          ‘Sopak has gone’            b. Sopakyi taruŋg kratukun
               Sopak =yi        taruŋg  kra -tu -ku        -n
               Sopak =erg.f firewood chop.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
               ‘Sopak chopped firewood’In (4-19a), there is no object, and the subject (S) of the sentence, Sopak, is
unmarked.
     In (4-19b), Sopak performs an action on an object. That object, like the subject
of the previous sentence, is unmarked. But Sopak receives the ergative clitic =yi,
which identifies her as the subject of the transitive clause.
     The ergative clitics that attach to the subject NP of a transitive verb also
encode gender and number. The markers that occur on NPs are:      =ŋi      masculine ergative
      =yi      feminine ergative (becomes =i when it follows r, t, nd, w and
               often k)
      =gi      plural ergativeNote that as in all other areas of Tayap grammar, gender is not indicated in the
plural number, so a word like rorsem=gi (‘children=erg.pl’) can refer to either
male or female children.
    These ergative clitics are also attached to the personal pronouns in a pattern
that maintains the plural meaning of =gi but not the gendered meaning of =ŋi
and =yi on 1sg and 2sg. In other words, gender is not marked in 1st and 2nd
persons.","[127, 128, 129, 130]"
" Habitual (hab)             actions or events that occur all the time; e.g. ‘She is
                            always smoking’ (discussed in Section 8.3.2).

If an action or event (a) has not occurred or won’t occur; (b) has not yet occurred
but may occur or is expected to occur, or (c) might have occurred but didn’t, Tayap
marks the following distinctions: Negative (neg)        actions or events that have not occurred or will not occur;
                       e.g. ‘I didn’t spear the pig’, ‘He won’t go to Wongan’ (see
                       Section 5.2).","[168, 169]"
"Whenever it is used, kv must occur as part of a serial verb construction, in con-
struction with other non-final verbs and/or fully inflected final verbs.
     Kv ‘bring’ is one of the most commonly occurring verbs in Tayap, since
villagers are constantly telling children and others to bring them things (kv +
object morpheme + aiki ‘come’) or take things away (kv + object morpheme +
okɨ ‘go’).
     Examples of its use are as follows (kv in bold):(8-11)   kv ‘bring’, ‘take’
         a. ŋaŋan sapwar kukuwe!
              ŋaŋan       sapwar ku -ku                 we

            ‘they took my basket’ (lit. ‘they left taking my basket’)As the only obligatorily non-final verb in the language, it is likely that kv has been
grammaticalized from an earlier independent verb stem. Note that according
to Haspelmath (1995), constructions like those described here for Tayap with kv
should not be considered svcs since kv is not an independent verb. However, while
kv is indeed not an independent verb, it is useful to consider it with other verbs
functioning in svcs. It takes object marking like a normal verb; it also has verbal
semantics. Further, kv can form part of longer sequences of verbs in a complex
predicate, like in example (8-1) in which kv is the second of three predicates func-
tioning together as a complex whole: here it is functionally identical to the other
non-final verb of the svc, clearly acting equivalently to other verbs in the language.
     Alternatively, the morpheme kv could be thought of as a converb, or an aux-
iliary. However with a converb one would expect a situation of adverbial subor-
dination (Haspelmath 2005: 3), and with an auxiliary one would expect tense,
aspectual, modal, voice or polarity semantics (Schachter and Shopen 2007: 41),
all of which are lacking here.
     Kv could also be thought of as an incorporated adverb. The best analysis,
however, would seem to be to regard kv as a grammaticalized non-final verb.","[255, 256]"
"
Tayap has a six-way distinction for singular referents – three for feminine ref-
erents and three for masculine referents. As in other parts of Tayap grammar,
the gender distinction collapses in the plural, and here the language maintains a
two-way distinction:

Note that the three-way distance distinction in the singular and two-way in the
plural is highly unusual and may in fact be a simplification: the middle term in
the singular could in fact be a close-to-addressee term or expressing other prag-
matic factors (see e.g. Wilkins 1999).5
     In addition to the words listed above, Tayap also has a number of slightly
different deictic words. They are as follows:
Feminine               Masculine                       Pluralaŋgok…aŋgo             aindet….ende ‘this …here’
                                   6
                                                       aŋgeb…aŋge
‘this... here’         anɨndet…ende/inde/ide/de        ‘these…there’
aŋgudek…aŋgu           ‘that…there’                    aŋgɨb… aŋgɨb ‘those…
‘that…there’                                           there’The first or second words in these pairs can occur alone functioning as an argu-
ment of a verb phrase. During a disagreement between two men, for example, one
protagonist responded to the other’s threats to come and beat him up with the
dismissive snort addressed to everybody who was listening:6(3-84) aindetŋike oyin?
       aindet      =ŋi       =ke o          -yi -n?
       that_one =erg.m =q strike.irr -1sg.irr.o -sg|1pl.irr.s
       ‘that one there is going to hit me?’These topicalizing deictic words often co-occur, sometimes multiple times in an
utterance.7 They can be post-posed to a noun to emphasize it, for example in
response to a question like ‘Who did it?’:5 We thank Anna Margetts for this observation.
6 The second word here, ende, can also be realized as inde, ide or de

ing” or “emphasizing” rather than topicalizing (Reesink 2014). More information and analysis
on the functions of all these deicitics is needed.

particularity and presence, e.g. ‘it’s me’, or ‘I’m here’ (as opposed to being away
somewhere). The term “demonstrative identifiers” comes from Diessel (1999).
These words function in a similar way to how an adverb like ecco functions in the
Italian eccomi – ‘it’s me’ or ‘here I am’. So the most common response to a ques-
tion like ‘Who are you?’ – asked, for example when one hears someone approach-
ing in the pitch blackness of a moonless night – is Ŋa ainda (‘it’s me’).    ainda    used with ŋa (1sg.m and 1sg.f)
                       yu (2sg.m and 2sg.f)
                       yim (1pl)
                       yum (2pl)
    ainde    used with ŋɨ (3sg.m)
    aŋgo(de) used with ŋgu (3sg.f)
    aŋge(de) used with ŋgɨ (3sg.pl) and dlThese words are virtually obligatory with many verbs, such as aku ‘be’, in the
sense that even though it would be grammatically correct to just say ŋɨ kut (‘he’s
here’), it is pragmatically awkward. One should say ŋɨ ainde kut (‘he dx.m is here’).
    Finally, in addition to all the deictic forms listed above, Tayap also has a
quasi-deictic suffix -me, which means ‘yes, indeed, that one (or those) as opposed
to any other or others’, occurring on pronouns.
    -me is also used to emphasize a referent, for example:(3-87) a. ŋgɨme aŋgi ŋgwokara
          ŋgɨ -me aŋgi ŋgwok          -ara
          3pl -dx dx.pl go.3pl.r -perf
          ‘they’re indeed the ones who left’ (as opposed to some other people
          having left)

          ‘Stop doing that!’The suffix -me occurs just prior to the deictic aŋgi in one of the most frequently
heard phrases in Tayap: ŋguméŋgi. This phrase – a contracted form of ŋgu-me aŋgi
(3sg.f-me + aŋgi) – means ‘yes, that way’, ‘that’s right’ (“em nau” in Tok Pisin).","[113, 114, 115, 116]"
"4.3.1 Functions of the ergative caseIn Tayap, ergative marking is “optional” (Foley 1986: 107; Dixon 1994: 58; McGregor
2010). This is typical in general of those Papuan languages which have an ergative
case (Foley 2000: 374; McGregor 2010: 1616). In many of these languages, ergativity
tends to be associated with a cluster of features, in particular agentivity, control and
animacy – most particularly agentivity, such that a more agentive transitive subject
is more likely to receive ergative case marking than a less agentive transitive subject.
     However in Tayap, as in many other languages, ergativity seems to be sensi-
tive to rather more factors than just agentivity.
     The oldest speakers agree that most utterances that omit the ergative are per-
fectly fine Tayap. Speakers do not reflect on the grammatical role of the ergative
markers; the way they explain them is in terms of utterance length. They say, “if you
want to say it the long way, you say ‘ŋayi’ [i.e. ŋa=yi ‘1sg=erg.f’]. If you want to say
it shorter, you say ‘ŋa’” (“Yu laik skulim, em ‘ŋayi’. Yu laik sotim, bai yu tok ‘ŋa’”).
     The functions of the ergative case in Tayap are rather opaque. The following
contrastive examples are intended to show that ergativity marking does not
equate simply to animacy, agentivity or control.

             ‘I’m hungry (lit. ‘hunger is affecting me’). You all make some sago jelly’The ergative is frequently used when the arguments of a verb are both animate,
and both present in the clause. In those instances, ergative marking is used to
clearly distinguish the subject of a transitive verb from its object.
    For example, the following sentence is ambiguous:(4-29) ŋɨ ŋgat poŋgɨn
       ŋɨ       ŋgat        po        -ŋgɨ        -n
       3sg.m cassowary strike.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
       ‘he speared the cassowary’ or ‘the cassowary stabbed him’ (with its claws)Speakers would normally interpret the fact that the pronoun ‘he’ occurs in the
sentence-initial position as indicating that ‘he’, and not ‘the cassowary’, is the
agent in this sentence. But without ergative marking the phrase is ambiguous,
and older fluent speakers say that it is poor Tayap.
    The reasons for the ambiguity are:
(a) the class 1 transitive verb o means ‘strike’ or ‘shoot’, and here it could mean
     either ‘penetrate or pierce with a spear’ or ‘penetrate or pierce with a sharp
     claw’; and
(b) cassowaries are typically gendered masculine, so the 3sg.m object suffix on
     the verb can refer to either a male person or a cassowary.","[132, 133, 134, 135]"
"Another example of how the perfect is used to distinguish different kinds of com-
pletedness is an extract from a conversation in which a man in his fifties was com-
menting to others about how young people no longer speak Tayap. This man says
that if young Gapuners go to another village and the people there want to attack
them and beat them up, they won’t be able to communicate with one another to
organize their defense. “What language will you speak to one another?”, he asks
rhetorically:(5-16) eŋgin mernɨ namkɨtak, ŋgɨgi tatukrora
       eŋgin         mer       =nɨ nam       -kɨ -tak            ŋgɨ=gi

       perceive.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -3pl.r.s -perf
       ‘If one speaks Tok Pisin, they’ve already understood your plans’ (lit.
       ‘You will speak in Tok Pisin, they’ve already understood it’). (Note
       the use of the feminine subject ending -tak to denote a non-specific,
       general referent; see Section 3.1.3.3.)Notice here that the use of the perfect here carries the meaning of ‘already’ – the
foreign villagers will have understood the unfortunate Tok Pisin-speaking Tayap
villagers’ plans before they are even finished being articulated.
     There are significant differences in how the perfect is used in the speech of
fluent speakers and how it is used by speakers younger than thirty. For fluent
speakers of Tayap, the perfect combines elements of tense (time in the past) and
aspect (relevance to now) and is used to mark an action as having been completed.
                                            Tense, aspect and mood in Tayap     157
For young speakers, the scope of the perfect suffix has been expanded. In addi-
tion to functioning grammatically to express temporal relations, it also functions
syntactically to coordinate clauses.
    Tayap has several clause coordinating suffixes, including the suffix -api,
which means ‘afterward’ (see Section 9.3.2). This suffix is not used by speakers
younger than thirty. Instead, one of the ways those speakers coordinate clauses is
with the use of the perfect suffix.
    Here are the two ways a fluent speaker might say ‘After she talked to Akep,
Mbopai left’:(5-17) a.   Akepre waraktakapi, Mbopai wok
            Akep      =re     warak -tak            -api Mbopai wok
            Akep      =loc talk.r -2sg.f|3sg.f.r -aft Mbopai go.3sg.f.r
            ‘after she talked to Akep, Mbopai left’       b.   Akepre warakrapi, Mbopai wok
            Akep      =re     warak     -r- -api Mbopai wok
            Akep      =loc talk.irr -r- -aft Mbopai go.3sg.f.r
            ‘after she talked to Akep, Mbopai left’The perfect is not used in either of these two sentences. The sentences do not fore-
ground the completedness of the action of talking; they foreground the temporal
relationship between the actions expressed in the clauses. They mark the sub-
ordinate clause (‘after she talked’) as the background or condition for the main
clause (‘she left’).
    Here is how a nineteen-year-old speaker of Tayap formulated (5-17):(5-18) Akepre waraktakara, ŋgu wok
       Akep =re       warak -tak                -ara ŋgu wok
       Akep =loc talk.r -2sg.f|3sg.f.r -perf 3sg.f go.3sg.f.r
       ‘she finished talking to Akep, she left’In this speaker’s Tayap, what should be the coordinating suffix -api is instead
realized as the perfect suffix -ara. That such a substitution can occur is partly
because the younger speaker calques on Tok Pisin while speaking Tayap.
     In Tok Pisin, the word “pinis”, which derives from English ‘finish’, is both
an aspect marker and a clause-coordinating adverbial. As a marker of aspect, it
follows a verb to indicate completed action. So compare:
158         5 Basic verb morphology(5-19) mi go                          vs.   mi go pinis
       ‘I am going’ or ‘I went’             ‘I have gone’       ol i toktok                    vs.   ol i toktok pinis
       ‘they talk’ or ‘they talked’         ‘they’ve finished talking’As a clause-coordinating conjunction, “pinis” forms an utterance in itself and is
said with rising intonation:(5-20) Mipela toktok igo igo.       Pinis,     mipela i go nambaut
       we       talk    duration ‘finished’ we          go around
       ‘we spoke for a while and when we were finished talking, we went our
       separate ways’Young speakers of Tayap model their use of the perfect on these dual functions
of Tok Pisin’s “pinis” and they use the perfect suffix to signify both a completed
action and clause coordination. They even pronounce verbs onto which they have
suffixed the perfect suffix as they would the Tok Pisin equivalent with “pinis”, i.e.
they use the same rising intonation that they use when speaking Tok Pisin.","[176, 177, 178]"
"So the negated form of this verb is:(8-2) tapr                   -at        kɨ    -ŋgɨ
      carry_on_shoulders.irr -3sg.m.nfo bring -3sg.m.r.o       atɨ              -kɨ    wákare
       go_down.irr -irr neg
       ‘(she) won’t (or didn’t) carry him down on her shoulders’Further, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana is a single phonological word (see Section 2.7).
Note, however, that the boundary between the non-final object (nfo, which in
this case is -at; see below 8.2.2) and the main final verb that takes subject marking
1 The vowel harmonizes to the vowel of the object.

is permeable, and can be interrupted by question morphemes and even separate
words, as in the following:(8-3) kopi tarak masinnɨ ŋgakrawokwankuk
      kopi        tar       -ak       masin=nɨ
      coffee (TP) take.irr -3sg.f.nfo machine (TP)=loc      ŋgakrawo -kwan               kuk
      shell.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o be.sg.f|1pl.r
      ‘we used to take the coffee to a machine and shell it’In this situation the form is no longer a single phonological word but still a single
predicate.
     Serial verb constructions are composed of one or more non-final verb(s) and
a final verb. The non-final verbs are always formally irrealis, but the final verb can
take the full range of Tayap’s TAM inflections. TAM and subject marking occurs
once across the construction, on the final verb, and the non-final verb(s) are
marked only for their object, if transitive.
     According to Haspelmath (2016: 296), a serial verb construction is “a mono-
clausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element
linking them and with no predicate-argument relation between the verbs”. It is
important to make clear that non-final and final verbs are both independent, and
there is not a relationship of syntactic dependency between the verbs of a serial
verb construction. Instead, there is a sharing of features (TAM, subject marking
and negation). The differences between non-final and final verbs are positional, a
factor of where they fall in the clause, rather than related to dependency.","[250, 251]"
"9.1 Simple sentencesA simple sentence in Tayap may consist of no more than an inflected verb. Thus,
a complex predicate like the serial verb construction discussed throughout the
previous chapter, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana ‘she intends to carry him down on her
shoulders’ is a fully formed sentence in Tayap. A simpler example is:(9-1) puko
      come_up.3pl.r
      ‘they came up’Word order is relatively flexible, since the grammatical relations of core constit-
uents and other elements are expressed through morphology and potentially
marked on NPs by case clitics like the ergative. However, Tayap is a verb-final
language and the unmarked order of elements in a declarative intransitive
sentence is Subject-Verb (SV), and in a declarative transitive sentence Subject-
Object-Verb (AOV):         subject        verb

the order of object and oblique is fairly free, with the caveat that the object
never follows the verb, while the oblique argument can. Also, the subject nor-
mally occurs in the sentence-initial position. Some examples of various word
orders follow:          subject     direct     verb                                     oblique

9.2 Complex sentences: Coordinate, subordinate

clause types.","[270, 271, 272]"
"5.4 Tense, aspect and mood in Tayap5.4.1 Overview of Tayap verbal morphologyIt should be clear by now that the fundamental distinction in Tayap’s verbal mor-
phology system is between real and unreal events. Verb stems marked as realis or
irrealis combine with other suffixes that also are marked for TAM to make tense
distinctions, to express the progressive and habitual aspect, and to encode modal
notions like desire and prohibition.
     The basic combinations, which can be modified by verbal suffixes and com-
pounding to produce more tenses and aspects, are as follows:Table 5.4: Overview of verbal morphology transitive verbs

Notice in the above table that irrealis and realis suffixes do not always combine
in expected ways. While some verb forms (like verbs in the non-future or the
future) are composed of verb stems, object suffixes and subject suffixes that
all are marked for either realis or irrealis, other verb forms (the prohibitive
(Section 7.2) and counterfactual (Section 9.4.3)) mix these suffixes, and have, for
example, intransitive verb stems marked for irrealis, but object and subject suf-
fixes inflected in their realis forms.
    If an action or event has occurred, is occurring or occurs regularly, Tayap
encodes the following distinctions: Perfect (perf)             actions or events that are completed; e.g. ‘He died’; ‘They
                            have finished the work’ (see Section 5.4.3.2).","[167, 168]"
"This speaker’s use of the clause subordinating morpheme -re (Section 9.4.1) is
morphologically correct – that is, it is placed correctly after the main verb in a
clause that thus becomes marked as subordinate. But it is semantically awkward.
A more fluent speaker would tell the story using the coordinating morpheme -a
(Section 9.3.1) in all instances where this speaker uses the subordinating mor-
pheme. This particular speaker uses -re more than all other young speakers
combined. It seems that she has identified the morpheme as a synonym for the
coordinating suffix -a.
     Three other kinds of clause linkage appear in young people’s narratives. The
first is the use of the perfect suffix to coordinate clauses, discussed in Section
5.4.3.2.
     The second is linkage accomplished with the word ‘okay’, which has become
part of Tok Pisin (as “oke”) via English.
     Here is an example from the narrative of a twenty-one-year-old man telling a
story about buying alcohol:(9-55) piatana ŋa mbot ŋgɨrekɨ oke Jastinŋi botol nambar mosenkun oke Simbɨraŋi
       non mosenkun oke ŋa ŋaŋan nambar kukumbota ŋgɨrekɨ akruna

       ‘…he gave me and I went with them, OK Jastin bought one bottle, OK
       Sɨmbɨra bought one, OK I took mine and went with them to drink…’
288        9 Simple and complex sentencesNote that ‘okay’ here performs the role of both -a (which this speaker uses profi-
ciently, as can be seen in lines 1 and 4 of this extract) and the clause coordinating
suffix -api, which links clauses that encode actions that occur one after the other
(Section 9.3.2).
     The third way young villagers sometimes link clauses is with the Tayap word
mai, which means ‘enough’, and the discourse marker nda. For many young
speakers, these two words have replaced the -api suffix as a way of indicating
that one action was completed before the next action began.
     This usage can be exemplified with an extract from a narrative told by a
nineteen-year-old woman:(9-56) …ŋayi wakuna wakuna mai, nda sowor ninkun. Sowor nitukuna mai,
       amayi mum nitukuna nda yim kakun uretrekɨ.

       ‘…I grated the coconut and, I grated it and enough, I made a boiling. She
       made a boiling, enough, then mama made sago jelly then we ate it with
       bamboo shoots’There are several grammatical errors in this short extract: the class 2 transitive
verb war ‘grate’ is inflected in a way typical of young speakers (see Section 6.1.3).
The expression sowor ninkun doesn’t exist – the speaker wants a verb, sowor-
pokun (‘I boiled a little’, from the verb root sowor-(p)-o ‘boil a small amount’).
And the speaker produces two different inflections for her *sowor construction:
                                   Complex sentences in young people’s Tayap      289
‘I did it’ (ninkun) and ‘she did it’ (nitukun), so it is never clear exactly who boiled
the small amount of bamboo shoots she talks about.
     As far as syntax is concerned, note how the speaker uses mai (‘enough’) to
express the completion of one action before the following action begins, and how
the discourse marker nda marks the beginning of the following action. This is
precisely the kind of clause coordination done by the Tayap suffix -api, and in
the speech of a fluent speaker, the young woman’s sentence would look like this:(9-57) ŋayi pap parkunapi, uret soworpokun
       ŋa =yi        pap       par     -ku                 -n          -api,
       1sg =erg.f coconut grate.r -3sg.f.r.o               -sg|1pl.r.s -aft        uret              soworpo                  -ku              -n
        bamboo_shoot boil_small_amount.r -3sg.f.r.o                 -sg|1pl.r.s
        ‘I grated the coconut, after I had grated it, I boiled a little bamboo shoots’That the utterance that this young woman actually produces in (9-56) is so far
removed from correct Tayap – in terms of vocabulary, verb inflection and mor-
phology – is sobering.
    It is a chill reminder that a tenacious and unique little language spoken by
very few people for a very long time is now on its way to oblivion.
Tayap TextsTayap Text 1: Two men are chased by their lover’s ghost
Narrated by Raya Ayarpa in 1987English translationI am going to tell the story of the old ancestors of Mbwadum. Once upon a
time (lit. before, in the old days) two men went to the Turuŋgwad clan. Kanjaŋ
village. For mangrove slugs. They were going to go and they went to their
lover and asked her: “Are you OK? We’re going to go for mangrove slugs at the
Turuŋgwad clan”.
     She told them, “The two of you go. I’m not a baby bird who is going to swallow
a seed and die”.
     Hearing her talk, they went. With their best dog, they went to the Turuŋgwad
clan. In Kanjaŋ village. Thus they went and the people of the Turuŋgwad clan
gave them gifts. They gave them the gift of two sticks of dried slug meat and they
sent them on their way and the two of them came back up [home].
     The two came up and went and came up to the Kirmar grassland.
     The woman too had died and her ghost went there. She went they came up.
They came up toward the grassland. They came up toward the Krimar grassland
and she asked them, “So the two of you come now, do you?”
     The two answered, “Yes”. They asked her, “Where are you going?”
     “I have children who are crying, so I’m going to Kandumsik stream to try and
net some fish”.
     “OK. You go on then, in that case”.
     She passed by them and put down her things, turned and cleared her throat
and said, “Who are you? Are you my lovers? It’s me”.
     They threw down their two sticks of slugs and then she chased them. She
chased them and brought them [towards the village]. She chased them and
brought them.
     The dog stood and was fighting with the spirit woman while the two ances-
tors picked up speed and came. The dog was fighting, fighting, fighting with the
spirit woman. Leaving her, he then came to the two ancestors. He came, came,
came, came, came, he came down to them.
     The spirit woman came close to them and he [the dog] stood and fought. He
was fighting with the spirit as the two ancestors came [towards the village].They

the bottom of Mbwadum mountain. They came up along the mountain.
    Children were below playing on the slope, they were shooting arrows at little
coconuts. They were shooting arrows at little coconuts when the two men came
up to them. They told them: “Call out to us!”. The children called out to them: “O!
O! O! O! O! O!”
    They [the men] fell and rolled down and died, their two bodies lay there
below. Their dog died together with them.
    The spirit woman, she had brought them thusly and she stood there and then
she turned and left them.
    Leaving them, she went away. The two men were laying there and they [other
men], thinking this must have something to do with ghosts, got a branch and spit
magic chants on it and as they were trying to bring them back, the two men got up.
    The others asked them: “What did this to you?”
     “The ghost, our girlfriend, chased us and came and her heat [i.e. her power]
affected us and so we died”.
     “OK”, said the others, “Come on then [back to the village]”.","[307, 308, 309, 310, 311]"

2 Semantic error: the verb nam- ‘tell’ is incorrect here; the speaker wants kotar-(p)-e- ‘ask’.
   Grammatical errors: the speaker omits the ergative clitic on the subject of the verb, and also
omits a locative case marker on Yengia, the undergoer of the verb. The grammatically correct way
of phrasing the question is:      ŋayar=ke yu=yi            morasi apro Yengia=nɨ    ni-tu-ku-n?

4.4 Peripheral casesTayap has five peripheral cases. Three of the cases mark animate and inanimate
referents differently.
     The possessive case marks possession, association and part-whole rela-
tionships, with no distinction between alienable and inalienable possession.
Possession is discussed in Section 4.5.
     The locative case has the widest semantic scope of Tayap’s peripheral cases. It
specifies location in time and space, covering relationships that in other languages
are expressed in allative, instrumental, comitative, temporal and durative cases.
     The ablative case expresses movement away from a person, place or object,
or an action of revelation in which something that was hidden becomes visible.
     The perlative case expresses movement along, through or by means of.
     The dative case is used to mark recipient, purpose, comparison and a number
of other relations.
     All these peripheral case markers are clitics, as they occur attached to the last
element of an NP with scope over the whole NP: see for example (4-40i), (4-40j),
(4-42b), (4-43d), (4-43i), among others. Many of them contain optional material
(shown in parentheses), the conditioning factors of which are not known.
Examples (the relevant peripheral case clitics are in bold):

130        4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession4.5 PossessionPossession is marked by a possessive clitic on the possessor. Possessor clitics
mark higher animate singular (=ma), higher animate plural (=mandama) and
inanimate (=ŋa) possessors. Note also that Tayap has external possession con-
structions, discussed in Section 7.5 in the section on benefactives.
     This clitic is also used to form relative clauses (Section 9.5), finite nominaliza-
tions (Section 9.6) and perception clauses (Section 9.7).
     Example (4-44) shows the possessive clitic marking an NP consisting of a
modified noun ‘cold belly’, thus demonstrating the clitic rather than affix status
of these forms:animate plural inalienable:(4-44)   imin pokemŋan munjema tɨk
         imin pokem =ŋan        munje          =ma       tɨk
         belly cold      =poss man             =poss     story
         ‘the calm man’s story’For the purposes of possession, animals and humans are considered higher ani-
mates, and plants are considered inanimate. Possessive relations expressed with
this construction include alienable, inalienable, body part, association and part-
whole possession. There is no morpho-syntactic distinction between these cate-
gories (but see Section 7.5 for the role of benefactive object suffixes in body part
possession).
     Some examples:animate singular body part (human):(4-45)   Mbanaŋma tokɨmot
         Mbanaŋ =ma              tokɨmot
         Mbanaŋ =poss            chest

inanimate part-whole:(4-47)   tumbŋa kandaŋ
         tumb         =ŋa     kandaŋ

         ‘the base of the mountain’inanimate association:(4-48)   mɨriŋa mbor

         nuwomb =ŋa            taw
         stream      =poss side
         ‘the side of the stream’Recursive possession also occurs, using the possessive clitic on each possessor,
with the possessee unmarked (see also example 4-44):(4-51)   Samekma rorma mbor suman
         Samek =ma         ror     =ma mbor      suman
         Samek =poss child =poss pig             big
         ‘Samek’s child’s big pig’The animate possessive clitic can be used on an inanimate noun to highlight that
the noun has some kind of relation to humans:

tion system, but this is all that remains of it now.4.5.1 =ŋa(n) poss with adjectivesThe possessive clitic =ŋa(n) can also occur in construction with adjectives (see
Section 3.3 for more on adjectives). However in these cases the function is clearly
not possession but rather modification. For example:(4-54)   iminkato sawirŋa

4.5.2 Possessive modificationThe possessive clitic can also occur, similarly to the above examples, but on
nouns or verbs as well as adjectives, to create modifiers: for example, in (4-57)–
(4-58) it occurs on a noun, rendering it a modifier, and in (4-59)–(4-61) it occurs on
an adjective which here modifies a verb:(4-57)   kandawŋa munje
         kandaw     =ŋa         munje

         ground     =poss    woman
         ‘ground woman’ (an insult: it means ‘you’re so old you have been
         around since when the ground emerged’)(4-59)   ei sumanŋa ror
         ei    suman =ŋa           ror

         ‘cry baby’ (i.e. a child who cries a lot)(4-60) warak sumanŋa noŋor
       warak suman =ŋa                 noŋor

         ‘bad, sore-ridden, smelly man’In (4-59) the verb ei ‘cry’ is modified by ‘big’, the phrase in its turn modifying the
noun ‘child’. Example (4-60) has the same structure: the verb is followed by the
possessive-marked adjective, together modifying ‘woman’. Example (4-61) is more
complex. Here we have a head noun munje ‘man’, modified by adjective ‘bad’ and

tions in which verbs can appear without person/status suffixes (see also Section 5.1).","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154]"
"3.1.3.3 Non-particular nouns
Nouns that otherwise could be expected to be masculine can be feminine under
two circumstances.
     The first is when the subject or referent of a verb is a general class of people
rather than a named or known individual. For example, the following utterance
is from a harangue by an older Tayap speaker who is chastising younger vil-
lagers for behaving badly. In the course of his harangue, the speaker wonders
rhetorically which big man (i.e. which old, knowledgeable man) is still alive to
teach young people about the good ways of the past. (The answer, he knows,
is ‘none’.)
     His question was phrased as follows:(3-22) Ani munje suman wuk?
       who man      big      be.3sg.f.r
       ‘Which big man is here (i.e. still living)?’Note that the verb ‘be’ is inflected in 3sg.f, even though the referent is unambig-
uously a male. The use of the feminine form here conveys generality. It refers to
the category or class of ‘big men’ rather than to a specific big man. If the speaker
had phrased the question using the 3sg.m form of ‘be’, kut, the question would
be referring to a specific named or known big man: ‘Which one of the big men we
all know is present here right now?’
     Another example of the same phenomenon is the following (feminine forms
that denote the male referent are in bold):
                                                                    Nouns        61

       ‘The man is of course finding his strength and doing it on his own,
       nobody else is telling him to’This utterance was spoken during a tense discussion about the incessant and dis-
ruptive drinking in the village that, by late 2009, had been plaguing Gapun for
some time. During a village-wide meeting, the mother of a fifteen-year-old boy
shouted angrily that her husband never tried to stop their son from drinking.
     In response, a man in his late thirties made the comment above, which is
dismissive of the mother and supports the young man’s father by implying that
it wouldn’t matter what the father told his son. The son, this man is saying, is old
enough and would act according to his own desires anyway: no one is ordering
him to drink; he does it because he wants to. But as in the previous example,
(3-22), this utterance refers to a male using feminine grammatical forms.
     The rhetorical effect is the same: the speaker’s use of feminine grammatical
forms when talking about a male conveys a meaning of generality. The speaker
is not overtly disputing anything the mother says about her son or her husband,
these grammatical forms say; he is making a general observation.
     A non-literal but semantically more accurate translation of the man’s remark
would be: ‘As young men get older and stronger of course they decide on their own
what they want to do, they don’t do things just because other people tell them to’.","[80, 81]"
"     Furthermore, the population of Gapun village is overwhelmingly young:
ninety percent of the total population is under forty years old, and only three
people in the village are over sixty years old. Today only about sixty people
actively command Tayap and only about forty five use the language to any extent
in their day-to-day lives.
     This grammar and dictionary is an attempt to document and preserve a small
part of the linguistic heritage of the Gapun people. Its publication will without
doubt have little or no impact on Tayap’s impending demise. Gapuners of today
have little need for their vernacular. They also have little desire for it – even
though no villager ever openly acknowledges this.
     Many instances of language death around the world start when adults more
or less consciously neglect to teach their home language to their children because
they want the children to succeed in school or because the home language is
socially stigmatized. This is not the situation in Gapun. No one in Gapun has
ever explicitly rejected Tayap, and no one disparages it or suggests that it should
be forgotten. On the contrary, Gapuners all express positive sentiments towards
their vernacular language. They all say they like it. Older adults occasionally flare
up and berate young people and children for not knowing it.
                    General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun   3
     But despite positive sentiments toward Tayap, day-to-day village life is now
overwhelmingly conducted in Tok Pisin. Village-wide meetings are in Tok Pisin,
church services are in Tok Pisin, gatherings in the men’s house are in Tok Pisin,
chatter on the field during soccer matches is in Tok Pisin, talk among women
visiting new mothers in maternity houses is in Tok Pisin. Informal conversations
involving villagers over thirty-five often involve code-switching between Tayap
and Tok Pisin, depending on who is present. But most conversations in Gapun,
between most people, take place mostly in Tok Pisin. Even private, intimate con-
versations occur overwhelmingly in Tok Pisin: young men who go off together in
groups to engage in secret rituals that make them feel lighter and more attractive
speak Tok Pisin to one another. Husbands and wives under thirty, when they are
alone together, speak Tok Pisin – a fact I know because when I asked a husband
or a wife to give me their opinion on their spouse’s competence in Tayap, they
usually answered that they couldn’t, because they almost never heard their
spouse speak Tayap.
     When villagers panic – for example when a drunken young man hurls himself
through the village swinging a machete at anyone he sees, or when a child is
bitten by a death adder in the middle of the village and no one knows where it
went – on occasions like those, the overwhelming bulk of everyone’s alarmed
screams to one another, tellingly, is in Tok Pisin, not Tayap.
     Equally tellingly, even senior villagers’ admonitions to younger people to
speak Tayap tend to be shouted in Tok Pisin. There is never any consistent effort
to teach children Tayap; indeed, whenever young people do occasionally attempt
to say something in it, any adult who hears them will often dismiss them with
a chuckle or a sneer, and loudly bemoan how poorly they speak the vernacular
language.
     Language loss is inevitably linked to cultural change, and during the past
few decades, Gapun has changed dramatically. The changes have not been eco-
nomic: Gapun villagers of today are not materially much better off than their great-
grandparents. Nor are villagers radically different from their post-war predecessors
in terms of their understandings of their place in the world: like their grandpar-
ents, today’s villagers still believe that Papua New Guineans are “the last country”
and that one day, hopefully soon, Jesus will return to Earth and bestow upon them
all the goods and riches that they believe He has already rewarded white people
with, everywhere else in the world. (The complexity of all this is the subject of my
two anthropological monographs on the village, Kulick 1992 and Kulick 2019.)
     What makes villagers of today very different from the generation born in
the 1940s and earlier is that the overwhelming majority of the social, cultural
and ritual practices that link them to their history have vanished. The men’s
house cult, which for generations was the backbone of Gapun culture, is broken.
4       1 The Tayap language and its speakersPreviously important social bonds – for example, relations between joking kin,
which are inherited relations to certain members of the clans into which one may
marry (njakum in Tayap, “wanpilai” in Tok Pisin) – are no longer observed and for
the most part no longer even known. Traditional healing rites, which depended
on knowing, respecting, flattering and sometimes threatening the spirits of ances-
tors and the powers of the rainforest, are now all regarded as suspicious at best
and Satanic at worst. Funerary rituals, which once engaged entire villages and
were occasions for important social gatherings, great feasts and the momentous
playing of the sacred flutes in the men’s house – these are all moribund.
     For the past fifty years, villagers have been much more interested in trying to
be good Catholics (villagers began to be baptized by visiting missionaries in the
early 1950s), trying to get their children educated, and trying to discover a way to
make money so that they can “develop” than they have been in talking about or
preserving their traditions.
     Like perhaps most people around the world, Gapuners care much more about
their future than they do about their past. And a price they seem destined to pay
for their enthusiastic orientation towards the future is not only the loss of their
traditions and history, but also the loss of their ancestral language.
     The death of languages is a phenomenon that linguists, anthropologists
and activists for indigenous and ethnic rights have long been aware of, and con-
cerned about. Much early linguistic and anthropological work was devoted to
“salvaging” what could be documented of traditions and languages that were
fading to extinction in the early decades of the twentieth century. During the past
twenty years, however, awareness of language death has turned from concern to
alarm.
     Linguists have realized that languages are becoming extinct at a rate seem-
ingly unprecedented in history. It is sobering to realize, for example, that ninety
percent of the indigenous languages spoken upon Cook’s arrival in Australia are
either dead or on the verge of dying. One overview has called the United States
“a graveyard for hundreds of languages” (Nettle and Romaine 2000: 5), noting
that eighty percent of the indigenous languages that still even exist there are
no longer being learned by children. Thirty percent of the languages spoken in
South America are thought to be “no longer viable”. And so on. The most widely
cited estimate of language death is the ominous prediction that ninety percent of
the world’s approximately six thousand languages are endangered (Krauss 1992,
Evans 2010). This figure, which at first glance seems hyperbolic and unbeliev-
able, becomes more comprehensible the moment it is realized that most people
in the world speak one or more of the one hundred largest languages. Those
big languages, linguists claim, are spoken by ninety six percent of the world’s
population.
                      General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun          5
    This means that four percent of the world’s population speaks the over-
whelming majority of the world’s languages. And those languages – thousands of
them, many of them undocumented – are believed to be in danger of vanishing
within the next one hundred years.
    Tayap is one of those languages. And in the literature on language death that
began burgeoning in the 1990s, it has sometimes been featured as a poignant
example. It is discussed, for example, in Daniel Nettle and Suzanne Romaine’s
comprehensive overview of language extinction around the world. Those lin-
guists cite my earlier work on Gapun (employing the spelling of “Tayap” that I
used previously; Kulick 1992) to make the point that:    Taiap is an amazingly rich language in terms of its structural diversity and particularly
    distinctive vocabulary, unlike any other in the Sepik. It is not clearly related to any other
    language in the area or indeed to any other language in Papua New Guinea as far as we can
    tell. (2000:13)
This celebration of Tayap’s uniqueness and complexity is a buildup that leads
to a somber punchline: “While further research might provide clues about the
precise genetic relationship between Taiap and other languages, this is unlikely
to happen. Taiap is dying”, write Nettle and Romaine, employing a baleful tone
that is characteristic of work on language death around the world.
     No one could dispute that the disappearance of a human language is a cause
for lamentation and mourning. And it would be insensitive and beside the point
to critique linguists’ attempts to inform a wider public about the widespread lan-
guage extinction that appears to be occurring across the globe today. But even
as we acknowledge and appreciate this, it is still possible to be skeptical of what
has emerged as a dominant way in which linguists discuss language death –
the likening of endangered languages to endangered animals and endangered
plants.
     Nettle and Romaine, for example, liken Tayap to a great bird. They write, “if
Taiap were a rare species of bird or Ubykh [another endangered language they
discuss] a dying coral reef, maybe more people would know of their plight and
be concerned”. And they continue, asking dramatically, “Should we be any less
concerned about Taiap than we are about the passing of the California condor?”
(2000: 13–14).
     A question like that is difficult to answer, not least because it is far from
obvious what “our” concern that Tayap is dying might actually materialize in prac-
tice, and what consequences those material expressions of “our” concern might
have for anyone living in Gapun. There is also a problem with likening Tayap to a
condor because exquisite as languages may be, they really are not like condors or
6       1 The Tayap language and its speakerscoral reefs. Condor chicks are not sent to schools where they are taught in a cos-
mopolitan language they’ve barely ever heard, and where they learn to devalue
their traditional condor ways. Coral reefs are not converted to Christianity and
told that their traditional reef ways are Satanic.
     To be fair, none of these things happen to languages either. But they do
happen to speakers of many of the languages that linguists are so concerned
about. Linguists like Nettle and Romaine who use species metaphors under-
stand this, of course. But in the current cultural climate that exhorts people
to develop concern for the environment and sustainability, many linguists
seem to believe that they can elicit some kind of sympathy and support for
dying languages if they talk about them in terms of biodiversity and species
loss.
     This way of thinking about language death is specious, however, because
it directs our attention to the natural world. By encouraging us to think in
terms of ecosystems rather than political systems, ecological or species met-
aphors elide, or at least defer, the simple realization that language death is
anything but a natural phenomenon. On the contrary, it is a profoundly social
phenomenon.
     Languages die because people stop speaking them, not because they exhaust
themselves in the fullness of time or are killed off by predatory languages of
greater phonological scope or syntactic richness.
     A better metaphor for language death, instead of seeing languages as
animals or organisms, would be to think of them like political movements,
philosophies or religions – that is, to consider them as social phenomena that
cannot be comprehended apart from history, beliefs, economics, desire, struc-
ture and power. And that necessarily change and sometimes even disappear as
the material, economic, social and cultural conditions that sustain them shift
and transform.
     With that in mind, and given the current state and tenor of Gapun village life,
I wish to make it clear that this grammar and dictionary of Tayap is not an effort to
influence the future. It is, instead, a record that documents what I am convinced
soon will be the irrevocable past. Gapun villagers are ceasing to speak their lan-
guage and if present trends persist, in thirty or forty years, Tayap will be gone
forever. While this is inconsolably sad, it is the villagers’ choice. It is a choice I
have no doubt that their descendants will castigate them for, as always eventually
happens with languages that die.
     But I do not write this grammar and dictionary with the fantasy that its
appearance will somehow change villagers’ lives and make them revive their
dying language. Indeed, I recognize that the opposite may – and at this point
probably will – happen. The appearance of Tayap words printed in a book may
                       General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun           7
foster resignation and complacency: a sense that, “Well now our language is all
there in a book, so we don’t really have to worry about it anymore, our children
can learn it from the book when they’re grown up”. Tayap in a book may also
solidify a view that the language is an august tongue of the ancestors far too
majestic and esoteric for young people to ever even attempt to master.
     So why write a book about Tayap? Partly to preserve some small part of the
proverbial treasure chest of human knowledge, certainly. But mostly, I have
written this grammar and dictionary primarily in the hope that a curious young
Gapuner, sometime in the probably distant future, will discover it somewhere and
value the fact that the obsolete language of his or her ancestors did not disappear
without a trace.
     The dictionary that accompanies this grammar is trilingual: Tayap, English
and Tok Pisin. A few of the villagers in Gapun have had as many as ten years of
schooling, most of it in English. Despite that, though (or, really, because of that),
none of them currently possesses anything but the most rudimentary command of
that language.1 No villager today will be able to make much sense of this grammar
of Tayap, but the dictionary part of this work may be entertaining and useful to
them now, as opposed to some distant future. And to facilitate that usefulness, I
have included definitions in the language that is replacing Tayap and in which all
villagers are fluent: Tok Pisin.
     I have also provided many examples of how the words in the dictionary
are used in Tayap, and I have purposely included a large number of vulgarities.
Gapun villagers are no different from anyone else who has ever scoured a dictio-
nary to see if it dared to list the most obscene terms that one and one’s sniggering
friends could dream up. I hope that the shock of seeing some of their most vulgar
words and insults immortalized in a book will provide the villagers with a great
deal of guilty pleasure.
     This grammar and dictionary should be of interest to linguists who study
Sepik and Ramu languages and the genealogical relationships of Papuan lan-
guages more generally. It should also interest archeologists and historians who
study the peopling and linguistic diversity of the Sepik region of Papua New
Guinea.","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"8.3.2 Habituals (hab)The habitual aspect marks an action as one that occurs all the time. To signal
habituality, speakers can use the progressive aspect, which has just been dis-
cussed above. However, if they want to emphasize the habitually recurring nature
of an action or event, they use the habitual aspect.
    An example of the habitual in use is the following comment, made about a
three-year-old child who loved to eat and who always managed to be on hand
when meals in several households were being served:(8-28) ŋɨ mum akwanawkkut
       ŋɨ       mum         a           -kwan    awk    kut
       3sg.m sago_jelly consume.irr -3sg.f.ben.o be.hab be.sg.m.r
       ‘he is always eating sago jelly’
                                                  Progressives and habituals   247
This habitual form can also carry the implication that the person who ‘is always
eating sago jelly’ doesn’t readily eat other forms of sago, such as sago pancakes.
     The habitual is formed in exactly the same way as the progressive, except that
‘be’ at the end of the verb is inflected with a specific form that expresses habit-
uality, awk-, followed by an inflected form of ‘be’. Thus, intransitive verbs that

            ‘Oŋaraŋ is always cooking food’Besides ‘be’, only two other verbs in Tayap – ‘come’ and ‘go’ – have suppletive
habitual stem forms:      ai          →    aiak
      come.irr         come.hab
      o           →    wak

            buy.irr     -3sg.f.irr.o -intent
            ‘they come to me every day to buy tobacco’Habituality can also be expressed not using a complex predicate like those dis-
cussed above, but by using an inflected form of the verb ‘to be’ as a simple pred-
icate. Habitual verbs can express habituality in a variety of temporalities. It is
possible to say that an action will always be happening in the future, for example.
This is done by taking the habitual stem awk- and inflecting it for future tense. So
compare:(8-32) a. a-ku-tak             b. awk-ku-tak
          be.irr-irr-3sg.f.irr    be.hab-irr-3sg.f.irr
          ‘it will be’            ‘it will habitually be’
7 often shortened to wakuk
8 Often shortened to aiakŋguk
9 Simple and complex sentencesThis final chapter of the grammar describes simple and complex sentences,
tail-head linkage, and the way in which young speakers typically form complex
clauses.
     Complex sentences are of three main types: coordinated clauses, cosubordi-
nate clauses and subordinate clauses.
     Coordinated clauses are independent clauses joined by various conjunctions.
     Cosubordinate clauses themselves are of two types: modifying and manner
structures.
     Subordinate clauses are also of three types: adverbial clauses (including
counterfactual clauses), relative clauses and perception constructions.
     Tayap also has finite nominalizations, and these are discussed after the dis-
cussion of relative clauses.","[266, 267, 268, 269, 270]"

8.2.3.2 Verbs which normally occur in svcs
With the exception of the grammaticalized verb kv (‘bring’, ‘take’), just discussed,
all Tayap verbs can be used independently, outside of serial verb constructions.
A number of verbs associated with motion, however, almost always appear as
non-final verbs in serial verb constructions.
     The most commonly occurring verbs of this type are the following (all verbs
in the svc are in bold):(8-12)   ru ‘propel’, ‘expel’
         a. Raya moŋar rukuotɨtek numatnɨ
             Raya moŋar ru               -ku            otɨtek       numat =nɨ

              clits have been sliced up by a crab’ (lit, ‘the crab sliced the women,
              (someone) pulled out the children, they fell’)2
2 It isn’t entirely clear why the verb otɨtek ‘fall’ here is inflected in 3sg.f (one might expect
ŋgotɨtek ‘fell.3pl.r’). One reason may be that the speaker, who was shouting angrily in affect,
produced an ungrammatical utterance. Another reason may be that the verb ‘fall’, when it is
used as part of a svc, as it is here, has become a formulaic expression, and is realized as otɨtek
for all subjects, regardless of gender or number. In example (8-13), the plural meaning of the verb
is conveyed by the nfo (-amb). Compare examples (8-12a) and (8-22).

verb constructions, as cosubordinate (medial-final) clause chaining construc-
tions, but an analysis of svcs reflects better the fact that they occur within single
clauses rather than across clauses. The svc as a whole generally forms a single
grammatical word, and NP arguments and negation are shared across the con-
struction. Also, medial verbs have overt linking morphology, which verbs in serial
verb constructions do not (see Section 9.8 for a discussion of medial-final clause
chaining, i.e. cosubordinate constructions).","[256, 257, 258, 259]"
"This entry should be read to mean the following:
(1) The irrealis form of this intransitive verb is irkɨ, consisting of the verb stem
     ir + the irrealis suffix -kɨ. This is the form the verb takes when it is negated –
     so one says irkɨ wákare ‘X (any subject) didn’t/won’t laugh’.
           The irrealis suffix -kɨ is a morpheme separate from the verb stem, but it
     is provided in the dictionary entry because, as discussed in Section 5.2.2 of
     the Grammar, there is no way of knowing what the suffix is unless one hears
     it (or sees it here).
340         Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionary            The form of the verb stem that appears in negation is also the form that
      constitutes the basis of all non-realis status and mood inflections; for example,
      ir-kɨ-ndak ‘laugh.irr-irr-3pl.irr’ [they will laugh], and ir-ŋgarana ‘laugh.
      irr-nd’ [X (any subject) better not laugh].","[359, 360]"

     It is evident that all the endings in the four groups listed above are variants
of the following endings:      1sg.f, 2sg.f, 1pl      →    k
      1sg.m, 2sg.m           →    t

      dl                     →    keMost intransitive verbs in Tayap fall into one of the above conjugation groups of
verbs. Below are some examples of verb roots that are inflected according to the
patterns listed above:

groups and exceptions. The subgroups are as follows:6.2.2.1 Group IIa, verb stems that begin with a
If the verb takes the group II -iet/-iek endings and the root begins with a, the fol-
lowing alternations occur in the realis, exemplified by arki- ‘go down’.    ŋa ‘I’                                                     kar-iet (m) / kar-iek (f)

    ŋɨ ‘he’               a in the root becomes ka-            kar-iet
    yim ‘we’                                                   kar-iek
    yum ‘you pl’                                               kar-kem    ŋgu ‘she’                                                  or-iek
                          a in the root becomes o-
    dl                                                         or-ke    ŋgɨ ‘they’            a in the root becomes ŋgo- and ŋgor-iek
                          the ending is -iek
194         6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsSeveral of the verbs in this subgroup have two equally possible forms in the 3pl
form: either the above form with ŋgo- + -iek, or o- + -ko.
    Consider for example amuku ‘fight’:(6-39) ŋa ‘I’               kam-iet (m) / kam-iek (f)
       yu ‘you’             kam-iet (m) / kam-iek (f)
       ŋɨ ‘he’              kam-iet
       ŋgu ‘she’            om-iek
       yim ‘we’             kam-iek
       yum ‘you pl’         kam-kem
       ŋgɨ ‘they’           ŋgom-iek or om-ko
       dl                   om-ke6.2.2.2 Group IIb, verb stems that alternate between t and r
Like class 4 transitive verbs, some intransitive verb stems that begin with r change
to t in the realis. The subject part includes an element that varies between t and
n. For example:
(6-40) rewkɨ ‘be afraid’
          ŋa ‘I’                 tew-niet (m) / tew-niek (f)
          yu ‘you’               tew-niet (m) / tew-niek (f)
          ŋɨ ‘he’                tew-niet
          ŋgu ‘she’              tew-tiek
          yim ‘we’               tew-niek
          yum ‘you pl’           tew-nkem
          ŋgɨ ‘they’             tew-tuko
          dl                     tew-tɨke6.2.2.3 Group IVa, verb stems that begin with a
Here the alternation is the same as in group IIa, above, with the difference that
those forms of the verb that there are realized as o (i.e. the inflections for 3sg.f

196          6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs6.2.3 Intransitive verbs in young people’s TayapIntransitive verbs present young speakers with even greater problems than tran-
sitive verbs. The unpredictable nature of the subject endings, as well as many of
the stem changes between the irrealis and the realis forms, leave increased scope
for uncertainty and mistakes.
     Many of the mistakes that young speakers make when inflecting intransitive
verbs are similar to the errors they make when they try to inflect transitive verbs.
Verb stem alternations are often disregarded, and young speakers inflect verbs by
mixing irrealis stems with realis subject endings. Examples are:
(6-41)   a. *muŋg      -ot
            stand.irr -sg.m.r
            ‘he stood’instead of         b. puŋg      -ot
            stand.r -sg.m.r
            ‘he stood’
            verb root muŋguku ‘stand’(6-42) a. *rɨp         -tɨke
          go_first.irr -dl.r
          ‘they two went first’instead of         b. tɨp         -tɨke
            go_first.r -dl.r
            ‘they two went first’
            verb root rɨpkɨ ‘stand’(6-43)   a. *amb      -tak
            hide.irr -2sg|3sg.f.r
            ‘she hid’instead of

           b. ombiek
              hide.r.3sg.f.|1pl.r
              ‘she hid’
              verb root ambuku ‘hide’Looking at the verb stems in the (b) examples here and comparing them to
the forms that young speakers produce in the corresponding (a) examples, it
is clear that the young speakers have a strong sense of the root forms of the
verbs they want to inflect. Once again, though, they lack the ability to produce
the correct inflections. In many cases, the forms they produce are intelligible –
anyone hearing muŋgot or rɨptɨke in the context of a story would have little dif-
ficulty understanding it. Other verbs that undergo both stem changes and less
common inflectional forms, like ambuku ‘hide’, present greater challenges to
comprehension.
     Example (6-43) above with ambuku ‘hide’ illustrates another feature of how
young speakers inflect intransitive verbs. Just as these speakers show a strong
tendency to collapse all classes of transitive verbs and inflect them as though they
were class 5 verbs, so do they tend, when they inflect intransitive verbs, to treat
them all as though they belonged to group I (see Section 6.2.1).
     So an irregular verb like takɨ ‘sleep’ will be realized as tatet ‘you (m) slept’
instead of the correct tat, and a verb with a regular but non-transparent inflec-
tional pattern like the one above, ombiek ‘she hid’, will be regularized to ambtak.
     Group I intransitive verbs take subject endings that are the most common
ones for intransitive verbs. Three characteristics of the subject endings in
this group make them particularly salient for young speakers. The first is that
they are, precisely, the most common subject endings that affix to intransitive
verbs.
     The second reason for their salience is the fact that they are identical in
form to the subject endings that affix to verbs in the future tense. So compare the
following:
Pronoun         Subject endings for group I    Subject endings for all verbs (both
                intransitive verbs in realis   intransitive and transitive) inflected

                   intransitive verbs in realis        intransitive and transitive) inflected

ŋgɨ ‘they’         -tuko                               -tuko/-ndak
dl                 -tike                               -tike/-nkemThat these endings occur so frequently in Tayap makes them readily available for
young speakers to access when they are trying to conjugate a verb with the correct
subject ending.
     The third reason why the subject endings listed above are particularly salient
for young speakers is because several of the forms are also identical to the imper-
ative endings of intransitive verbs – even those verbs that have other subject
endings in the realis.
     So in the imperative mood, even a verb as irregular as okɨ ‘go’ takes a regular
ending and becomes o-tet (‘go.sbj-2sg.m.r’) or o-tak (‘go.sbj-2sg.f.r’) or o-nkem
(‘go.sbj-2pl.r’).
     Following this pattern, the imperative command telling a female to hide is
amb-tak (from the verb root ambuku). This is exactly the form that the speaker
who wanted to say ‘she hid’ produced in a narrative. The form is incorrect, but the
reason she chose it, and not some other form, is clear.
     Intransitive verbs of motion present special problems for young speakers
of Tayap. A language like English uses a wide range of prepositions to encode
various kinds of motion. So English speakers say ‘go up’, ‘go down’, ‘go across’,
‘go around’, ‘go first’, ‘go inside’ and so on. Tayap has separate verbs for all of
those motions (and many more): wurkɨ ‘go up in a direction’, wuwku ‘ascend’, aski
‘go down in a direction’, sirki ‘descend’, utak-(p)-oski ‘go across’, rɨpɨkɨ ‘go first’,
arkɨ ‘go inside’. All those verbs either change their stem form – often dramati-
cally – in the realis status and/or they have irregular and unpredictable inflec-
tions. An example is the common verb ‘go’, which has a stem form of okɨ in the
irrealis, but which in the realis becomes mbot ‘he goes’ (or ‘I (m) go’ or ‘you (m)
go’), wok ‘she goes’, ŋgwok ‘they go’, etc.
     The unpredictability and irregularity of verbs of motion has resulted in their
becoming relatively scarce in the speech of speakers under thirty. The weakest
speakers get by with just two verbs of motion: okɨ ‘go’ and aiki ‘come’. The nature
of speakers’ narratives sometimes forces them to attempt other verbs, like sirki
‘descend’ (if the narrator has someone up a tree) or arkɨ ‘go inside’ (if the narrator
                                               Intransitive verbs in the realis   199
is talking about going inside a particular area of rainforest where a pig has been
speared or a venomous snake spotted). But young speakers’ attempts to inflect
those verbs are often either not correct or are arrived at only after discussion with
friends.
     Even the common verbs ‘go’ and ‘come’ present many young speakers with
problems as soon as they have to inflect the verb for a person other than the sin-
gular ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘he’, ‘she’ or ‘we’ (whose subject ending is always the same as the
1sg.f ending). The inflections for 2pl, 3pl and dual – all of which are quite differ-
ent from the other subject endings – tend to be avoided, and when they do occur
they tend to be either wrong or the result of much back-and-forth negotiation
among the narrator and his or her friends.
     The dual form, in particular, seems moribund. It should have occurred in
many of the narratives I collected, because many young people talked about how
they did something in the rainforest or the mangrove swamp together with one
close friend. The overwhelming tendency in those narratives, though, was to use
the 1pl ‘we’ form of the verb instead of the dual – so speakers said yim mbok ‘we
went’ or yim kuk ‘we were’, when what they wanted was yim woke ‘we two went’
and yim wuke ‘we two were’.
     A final strong tendency in regards to intransitive verbs is phonological.
Young speakers frequently reduce the number of vowels that occur in a verb.
Particularly vulnerable is word medial ɨ, which often gets eliminated, and the
vowel cluster ie, which often gets reduced to e. So for example a verb with a vowel
cluster like tewtiek ‘she ran away’ becomes tewtek or tetwek. Priek ‘she went
down’ becomes prek, and so on.
     This is a phonological process that probably has been going on in Tayap for
some time. In the 1980s, I recorded senior men who consistently said things like
katɨtɨtet ‘he fell’. In other words, their versions of these verbs had more word-
medial vowels than are present in the speech of even the oldest speakers today.
What seems to have happened in Tayap is that medial syllables have undergone
a steady process of reduction.(6-44) ‘he fell’ katɨtɨtet    → katɨtet       → katet

7 MoodMood is the name given to the ways a language grammatically encodes a speaker’s
attitude toward an utterance. How does a speaker issue a command or express a
wish? Voice a doubt or assert a fact? English accomplishes many of these kinds of
speech acts with modal verbs like ‘can’, ‘will’ and ‘must’. Tayap expresses them
with particular kinds of verbal morphology. The declarative or indicative mood
(i.e. making a statement) has been presented this grammar. It is not morphologi-
cally marked in Tayap. The interrogative mood is expressed with the interrogative
clitic =ke, discussed in Section 3.9.
      Other moods that are indicated through particular morphology on a verb are
as follows:
– Subjunctive (including imperative, jussive, indirect commands and wishes)
      (Section 7.1)
– Prohibitive (Section 7.2)
– Admonitive (Section 7.3)
– Intentional (Section 7.4)
– Benefactive (Section 7.5)Other free-form mood particles are also discussed (Section 7.6).
    Note that the realis/irrealis distinction which is fundamental to so much of
Tayap’s verbal morphology is considered in this work to be a status distinction
rather than a mood distinction, and as such is discussed in Chapters 5 and 6
rather than here. Note also that the realis/irrealis distinction is not available to
non-indicative moods apart from the benefactive.","[212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220]"
"3.6 Quantifiers3.6.1 CountingThe traditional counting system in Tayap was based on a person’s fingers and
toes. This is a well-known areal feature (Laycock 1975). The Tayap system allowed
counting up to twenty, although in principle the system could count indefinitely,
because after reaching twenty, one could, I was told, begin counting again on the
body of another person (so ‘twenty-one’ could be ‘two hands and two legs and
one hand one finger on the other side’).
     This laborious system, for which there seems to have been no shorthand, dis-
appeared rapidly after villagers began speaking Tok Pisin among themselves in
the 1930s and 1940s. Today it is only vaguely remembered, and is regarded as an
amusing, cumbersome and primitive curiosity by everyone in Gapun.
     Villagers still use the Tayap words for ‘one’ through to ‘five’, and they some-
times combine them to denote a number between five and ten. For example, I
once overheard a villager ask another in Tayap how many bags a cocoa buyer who
had come to Gapun had filled (this was a typical instance of using Tayap to “hide
talk” from non-villagers). The addressee, a thirty-year-old man who is a very weak
speaker of Tayap and who under other circumstances never speaks it, responded
by saying manaw towotowo (literally ‘three four’), which in this context meant
seven bags.
     Villagers also sometimes use the Tayap word for ‘ten’, but never any of the
others, which are always said in Tok Pisin.
     The traditional system, as I recorded it from senior men in the 1980s, is as
follows:    nambar                              ‘one’
    sene                                ‘two’

which the number is the main verb and the event that happens a number of times is

forms are the closed class of nouns denoting some humans, and pigs and dogs. All
other nouns have only one form. To indicate plurality in those nouns, the following
quantifiers may be used. They immediately follow the noun to which they refer:
    samb     general marker of plurality, most often used with countable

there is a handful of adjectives that have separate dual and/or plural forms. Further,
Tayap has a marker that attached to adjectives to signify ‘more than one’. This plural
marker (anem) is moribund; these days it is heard in the speech only of speakers over
sixty. From one of those speakers, I elicited sentences such as the following:(3-78) a. numbwan eŋgon anem munjenum
          numbwan eŋgon anem            munjenum
          thought    good poss.pl man.pl
          ‘men with good thoughts’ (lit. ‘good thoughts men’)        b. rew suman anem munjenum
           rew suman anem             munjenum
           fear big        poss.pl man.pl
           ‘cowards’ (lit. ‘big fears men’)In naturally occurring speech of older speakers, this marker of plurality was used
most productively in the context of abuse. Indeed, I was first alerted to it when
transcribing the many “kros-es” (loud public arguments, almost always started
and sustained by women) that occurred in the village (Kulick 1993). There, anem
(shortened to nem after the vowel in the preceding word) occurs in abusive
phrases like the following:(3-79) a. iminkato sawirŋa nem!
          iminkato          sawir =ŋa nem
          lower_intestine black =poss adj.pl
          ‘black assholes!’        b. man sumanŋa nem!
           man suman =ŋa      nem
           cunt big     =poss adj.pl
           ‘big cunts!’The retraction of what may have been a much more widely used marker of plural-
ity to the context of vituperative abuse is an instructive instance of how particular
registers of language (such as abuse) can be repositories of older, obsolescent
forms that for various reasons have all but died out in the language otherwise.
92       3 Word classes3.7 ArticlesTayap has no definite article. The definiteness of a referent emerges either through
the context or because it occurs together with a deictic word.
     The language does, however, have a word, non, which means ‘a’ or ‘some’ –
in the sense of ‘some man’ or ‘some child’ – and which can function as an indefi-
nite article. The word does not mean ‘one’: to specify a singularity, the quantifier
nambar ‘one’ is used (see Section 3.6.1). The word non can occur independently,
as in the following request, which is heard ubiquitously in Gapun, uttered by
someone asking someone else for betel nut:(3-80) non kukukwe
       non     ku     -ku            -we
       indef bring -3sg.f.r.o        -come.sbj
       ‘give me one/some’ (lit. ‘bring me one/some’)When non occurs after a noun, it imparts indefiniteness. If non does not occur,
the referent will likely be interpreted as definite. An example is a sentence like
the following:(3-81) rorŋi ŋgat tanŋgɨn
       ror    =ŋi       ŋgat   ta    -n -ŋgɨ        -n
       child = erg.m cassowary see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.sThis sentence would likely be interpreted to mean ‘the child saw the cassowary’,
but it can mean both ‘the child saw the cassowary’ and ‘the child saw a casso-
wary’. The context of the utterance would usually make it clear if a definite or
indefinite noun were meant.
    If a speaker wanted to emphasize indefiniteness, he or she could use non or
non samb (Section 3.6.2) after the nominal it modifies:(3-82) a. rorŋi ŋgat non tanŋgɨn
          ror    =ŋi      ŋgat      non ta   -n -ŋgɨ        -n
          child =erg.m cassowary indef see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘the boy saw a cassowary’       b. ror nonŋi ŋgat non tanŋgɨn
          ror    non     =ŋi      ŋgat non
          child indef =erg.m cassowary indef

              ‘some (unnamed and possibly unknown) boy saw a cassowary’3.8 Deictics (dx)Deictics in Tayap locate a referent in space and time, and can be translated as
‘this’ or ‘that’ and ‘here’ or ‘there’. The language has a word ai for ‘here, and anɨnɨ
for ‘there’. These words are used in simple commands to put something or bring
something ‘here’ or ‘there’:(3-83) a. ainnɨ wo ŋgritukun
          ai      =nɨ    wo    ŋgri -tu -ku       -n
          here =loc on_top put.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
          ‘put it here on top’         b. anɨnɨ wo ŋgritukun
            anɨnɨ wo          ŋgri -tu -ku      -n
            there on_top put.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
            ‘put it there on top’
              Note: the locative clitic =nɨ on anɨnɨ is optional and frequently omitted (as it is in
              this example) probably because the word ends with nɨ, which is homophonous
              with the locative clitic.","[107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113]"
"3.1.3.2 Principles of gender assignment
There are two genders in Tayap: feminine and masculine. Humans have natural
gender, even though this can be overridden when the referent is non-particular
(see below). The gender classification of all other animate nouns is decided by
three criteria.
58          3 Word classes    The first is particularity: the unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including
animate nouns, is feminine.1
    The second is sex: a male referent may be specified as masculine and a female
referent feminine.
    The third criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be
masculine; short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine.
    Snakes (long and thin) and cassowaries (tall and imposing), therefore, are
prototypically masculine; pigs (fat and stocky) are prototypically feminine. So in
a sentence like ‘he speared a pig’, the object ‘pig’ will be designated by the femi-
nine object suffix -ku unless the speaker specifically wants to point out that it was
male, in which case the masculine object suffix -ŋgɨ would be used.
    The difference is as follows:(3-19) a. ŋɨŋi mbor pokun
          ŋɨ      =ŋi       mbor po         -ku                       -n
          3sg.m =erg.m pig         strike.r -3sg.f.r.o                -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘he speared a (female) pig’        b. ŋɨŋi mbor poŋgɨn
           ŋɨ      =ŋi      mbor po           -ŋgɨ       -n
           3sg.m =erg.m pig          strike.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘he speared a (male) pig’The following chart shows the process of gender assignment in Tayap:
                                              Is it particular?
                                          yes               no                                   is it male?             feminine
                             yes                 no
                                                 feminine      shape long?                      shape stocky?
      yes       no                     yes            nomasculine       feminine           feminine           masculineTayap gender decision tree
1 Foley (2000: 371) notes that among those Papuan languages which have gender, binary con-
trasts are typical, and feminine is always the unmarked gender.
                                                                     Nouns           59
     As the chart suggests, even though snakes and cassowaries are commonly
masculine, a short, fat snake or a squat, short-necked cassowary could be referred
to using feminine forms.
     The shape-based assignment of gender is not entirely predictable, however.
A praying mantis is generally masculine, perhaps because its name is homopho-
nous with ‘cassowary’ (i.e. ŋgat). And a millipede (kakámatik), even though it is
long, is generally feminine, perhaps because it is stubby, fat, and slow moving,
at least compared to a centipede (yandum), which is sleek and slithering (and
generally masculine).
     Even though nouns tend to be generally classified as feminine, there are
some nouns which are always (in the case of natural phenomena and insects) or
tend to be (in the case of animals and birds) masculine.
     The nouns in question are:Natural phenomena       Animals, birds and insectsarawer ‘sun’            aram ‘snake’                    ŋgararik ‘monitor lizard’
ŋgudum ‘star’           kakarpwap ‘eagle’               ŋgat ‘cassowary’; ‘praying
nekan ‘earthquake’      kamban ‘magpie’                 mantis’
aruat ‘thunder’         kekékato ‘worm’                 njakep ‘flying fox bat’
pora ‘wind’             momɨk ‘guria pigeon’            ondom ‘hornbill’
urerŋgar ‘lightning’    nekan ‘stick insect’, Note:     orem ‘crocodile’
                        homophonous with ‘earthquake’   pesaw ‘bird of paradise’
                                                        yandum ‘centipede’
Examples are:(3-20) nekan        katot
       earthquake happen.3sg.m.r
       ‘an earthquake (m) happened’(3-21) ŋayi aram tanɨŋgɨn
       ŋa =yi          aram ta -nɨ -ŋgɨ      -n
       1sg =erg.f snake see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r. s
       ‘I (f) saw a snake (m)’This gender system shares some similarity with the East Sepik, Ndu family lan-
guage Manambu, in which gender assignment is determined in part by the size
and shape of the referent (Aikhenvald et al. 2008; see also Reesink 2003 on North
Papuan languages). Aikhenvald et al. (2008: 112) note that shape-based gender
assignment is a feature of languages of the Sepik area, also citing Alamblak (Bruce
60        3 Word classes1984). Other languages of the Sepik-Ramu region have gender, but very different
systems: Foley (2000: 366) notes for instance that Lower Sepik languages have a
phonological gender system; that is, gender assignment is based on the phono-
logical form of the noun root.
    On the other hand, the situational element to Tayap’s gender system – in
which gender is partly a matter of the discourse situation rather than a fixed
property of a noun – is reminiscent of that of Bilua, a Papuan language spoken
on Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands. In Bilua, masculine gender is used
for third-person singular masculine human referents as well as “singulative”
non-human nouns. But all other nouns are marked feminine, the default form
(Obata 2003: 88, 105–109).","[77, 78, 79, 80]"

5 Basic verb morphology5.1 General properties of Tayap verbsIn Tayap a single complex predicate can express the equivalent of an entire
sentence in English. This is most apparent in its serial verb constructions,
which can express a complex action like ‘she intends to carry him down on
her shoulders’ in a single predicate (tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana). Serial verb con-
structions like this are discussed in Chapter 8. For basic sentence structure, see
Section 9.1.
    Transitivity, TAM (tense, aspect and mood) and realis/irrealis status are mor-
phologically encoded in verbs by suffixes, with the object suffix preceding the
subject suffix.
    In transitive verbs, this occurs in the following manner:(5-1) a. poŋgro
         po                         -ŋg                           -ro
         verb stem ‘strike’         -object/undergoer ‘him’       -subject/actor ‘they’
         in realis                  in realis                     in realis          ‘they hit him’       b. oŋgrɨndak
          o                         -ŋgrɨ                         -ndak
          verb stem ‘strike’        -object/undergoer ‘him’       -subject/actor ‘they’
          in irrealis               in irrealis                   in irrealis           ‘they will hit him’Intransitive verbs, too, signal both subject and status, but many of them tend to
do so in a more fusional manner than is the case for transitive verbs, especially in
the non-future tense (which expresses events or actions that are occurring in the
present or that have occurred in the past).
    An example of intransitive verbs is the verb poror ‘sing’. Some of the forms
that this verb takes in the non-future and the future tenses are as follows:(5-2) a. poror-net                          poror-nak                   poror-ŋguk
         sing.r-1sg.m|3sg.m.r               sing.r-1sg.f|1pl.r          sing.r-3pl.r
         ‘I (m) sang’ or ‘he sang’          ‘I (f) sang’ or ‘we sang’   ‘they sang’https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-005

(except in certain modification constructions, see Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2), and
which also never occur without being marked for status, either realis or irrealis
(although some verbs, e.g. poror above have the same stem for both). The root
forms of these stems – that is, the forms that are available for derivational pro-
cesses like nominalization, and the citation forms that are entered in the diction-
ary as the lexical entry for a verb – are the irrealis forms of the stem.
     A note is in order on the terms “roots” and “stems” as they are used here.
Roots are the lexical parts of a word, the unanalyzable part left once the
affixes are all taken off. Stems are involved when inflectional affixes apply to
different forms of a root (Aikhenvald 2007: 38–40). So Tayap verb roots have
inflectional stems: that is, for instance, there are separate inflectional stems
for realis and irrealis. In this grammar, “stem” refers to the inflectional possi-
bilities of a verb root, and “root” designates the basic underlying lexical part
of the verb.
     Verbs in Tayap have the following structure:                                    V – O – (A)
                                      V – (S)Note that verbal morphology, unlike clausal relations, follows a nominative-
accusative alignment system.
    Verbs in Tayap mark the following elements:Status
Has the action of the verb happened or is happening? Has it not happened?","[155, 156, 157]"
"4.3.2 Ergativity in the speech of young peopleYoung villagers under thirty who narrated stories for me in Tayap produced erga-
tive constructions in their speech, but they had a tendency to overuse the ergative
markers on intransitive verbs. The subjects of intransitive verbs like ‘be’, ‘cry’,
‘stand’, ‘talk’, ‘shiver’ and ‘work’ were all marked with ergative case marking in
various young people’s narratives.
     Even when used in transitive verb phrases, the ergative morpheme was
sometimes attached to constituents that were not the subjects of the verb. For
example, one twenty-three-year-old man narrated a story about how a young girl
had accused him of having raped her.
     In telling the story, he said the following (note that the ellipsis denotes a
series of false starts and repetitions that have been omitted, and the ergative mor-
pheme is highlighted in bold):(4-38) Mosi katota namnin, ‘Ŋayarke yu Yengia…morasi aproyi nitukun’?
       Mosi katot             -a     nam -n -i            -n

       do.r -s      <3sg.f.r.o>    -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
       ‘Mosi went down and told me ‘Is it true that you did something bad to
       Yengia?’
120          4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThere are semantic and grammatical errors in this sentence,2 but of interest here
is the ergative clitic, which the speaker attaches to the object noun phrase ‘bad
deed’ instead of to the subject of the verb phrase, ‘you’.
     I suspect that this error occurred because the speaker seems to know that the
verb nir- (‘do’ or ‘make’) usually co-occurs with an ergative marker. But his sense
appears to be that the marker attaches to the noun or noun phrase that immedi-
ately precedes the verb; not necessarily the subject of the verb phrase.
     This is a typical error made by speakers under thirty. It indicates that young
speakers have parsed the ergative case marker as a formulaic part of a verb
phrase involving certain verbs – in particular, the verbs ‘know’, ‘say’ and ‘do’.
But these speakers seem to be not entirely aware that the marker does particular
syntactic and semantic work. If the ergative case clitic was really a strong marker
of agency, control or animacy one might expect speakers to be aware of that,
albeit subconsciously, and make mistakes accordingly; however that does not
seem to be the case.
     In addition to having problems with the placement and the function of
the ergative clitic, young speakers also often make mistakes of gender with it.
They overextend the feminine form =yi and use it when talking about males and
plural referents. So they say things like sas=yi (‘father=erg.f’, instead of sas=ŋi
‘father=erg.m’) and njenum=yi (dog.pl=erg.f, instead of the correct njenum=gi
‘dog.pl=erg.pl’).
     This overextension of =yi probably occurs because =yi is the ergative ending
on the 1sg and 2sg pronouns (ŋa=yi and yu=yi). Speakers would have heard the
yuyi form all their lives, every time an older speaker ordered them to carry or take
or fetch or hit something. And since the narratives that people in Gapun tell one
another are almost invariably accounts of personal experiences – what the nar-
rator him or herself saw, heard, dreamt, etc. – the ŋayi form would also be very
salient for speakers. Furthermore, the unmarked gender in Tayap is feminine see
Section 3.1.3. That young speakers would overextend the feminine form, rather
than the masculine =ŋi, is therefore not surprising.","[139, 140]"
"7.1.2.1 Intransitive imperatives
The imperative forms of intransitive verbs are the single most salient grammati-
cal feature of Tayap, both for the speakers of Tayap and for everyone else in the
lower Sepik area who has ever heard of the language. Whenever Tayap speak-
ers talk about their vernacular, they merrily tell anyone who is willing to listen
that Tayap “is broken into a woman’s language and a man’s language” (“i bruk
long tok ples bilong ol meri na tok ples bilong ol man”). If you want to talk to a
woman, they explain patiently, you have to use the “women’s language” (“tok
ples bilong ol meri”). If you want to talk to a man, you have to use the “tok ples
bilong ol man”.
     Anyone who has followed this grammar this far knows that Tayap does indeed
have a number of gender-specific forms, such as the difference in first-person
forms for intransitive verbs inflected in the non-future tense (a male says ŋa mbot
‘I went’; a female says ŋa mbok; see Section 6.2). But this particular gendered
distinction is not primarily what the villagers have in mind when they talk about
how their language is broken in two.
     Instead, the villagers who describe Tayap in that way are referring to a single
feature of grammar, namely the different forms that the imperative of an intran-
sitive verb takes when it is addressed to a woman or to a man. The dramatic way
villagers describe this feature of their grammar, however – that you have to speak
to men and women using their specific “languages” – makes it seem as though
the entire Tayap language is “broken” in two.
     The villagers’ exegesis carries the unspoken implication that even parts of
speech like nouns have female and male forms, and that both those forms must
be mastered in order to be able to talk at all. Non-Gapuners who listen to Gapun
villagers describe Tayap in this way always react with understandable dismay,
and they inevitably shake their heads in wonder that a human language could
possibly be so complex. Some of them then go off and augment the complexity
                                                          Subjunctive (sbj)       203
further, informing others that, in fact, Tayap is “broken” into four languages: one
for women, one for men, one for girls and one for boys.
     Gapuners’ story about Tayap’s difference from other vernacular languages
must have arisen because no other language in the area marks gender on the
imperative forms of intransitive verbs. This is a salient feature of language
because whenever villagers from different places meet, one way many of them
enjoy spending time is to quiz one another on what one calls common objects –
‘betel nut’, ‘lime’ (for chewing betel nut), ‘tobacco’, ‘pig’, ‘dog’ and ‘sago jelly’
are the inevitable ones – in their respective vernaculars.
     Once these words have been exchanged, many people then go on to ask
about simple verbs: “How do you tell someone to come?”, they ask each other;
“How do you say ‘go’?”. Anyone asking a Tayap speaker that question will
receive the spiel about the vernacular being “broken in two” in response, and
so the story about the bizarreness of the little language that really is two – or is
it four? – separate languages gets perpetuated and spread throughout the lower
Sepik area.
     Despite the hype, however, the imperative form of an intransitive verb is
a simple construction. All it involves is (a) a verb stem inflected to express a
speaker’s wish that another person do something – in other words, a verb stem
inflected in the subjunctive mood – and (b) a subject ending that marks gender
and number. So the imperative for any intransitive verb is formed in the following
way (recall that 2nd person dual uses the plural form; see the discussion that
precedes example (3-73)):                                  +   -tet (2sg.m.r)
    subjunctive verb stem         +   -tak (2sg.f.r)
                                  +   -nkem (2pl.r|dl)The subjunctive stem of a verb is almost always the same as the form that verb
takes in the irrealis status. Examples are:(7-2) a. male            o-tet          muŋgo-tet         pruk-tet
         addressee       go.sbj-2sg.m.r stand.sbj-2sg.m.r work.sbj-2sg.m.r
                         ‘You go!’      ‘You stand!’      ‘You work!’      b. female          o-tak            muŋgo-tak            pruk-tak
         addressee       go.sbj-2sg.f.r   stand.sbj-2sg.f.r    work.sbj-2sg.f.r
                         ‘You go!’        ‘You stand!’         ‘You work!’
204        7 Mood      c. plural     o-nkem                 muŋgo-nkem           pruk-nkem
         addressees go.sbj-2pl.r           stand.sbj-2pl.r      work.sbj-2pl.r
                    ‘You all go!’          ‘You all stand!’     ‘You all work!’In all the examples above, the stem form of the verb in the subjunctive is identi-
cal to the stem form of those verbs in the irrealis status. There are exceptions to
this pattern (for intransitive verbs; transitive verbs have exceptions discussed in
7.1.2.2), however, such as the following, where the verbs have a subjunctive-spe-
cific form:(7-3) a. ai (irr) ‘come’ → we- (sbj, so: we-tet, we-tak, we-nkem; see example
         7-1 above)
      b. tutu (irr) ‘sit’ → tuto- (sbj, so: tuto-tet, tuto-tak, tuto-nkem)Verb roots ending in r gain the vowel e before the imperative ending, which is
also stressed:(7-4) a. rar (irr) ‘ look’ → raré- (sbj, so: raré-tet, raré-tak, raré-nkem)
      b. sir (irr) ‘descend’→ siré- (sbj, so: siré-tet, siré-tak, siré-nkem)If these exceptions only occurred in the imperative mood, it would be possible to
simply classify them as exceptions and maintain that the stem form of an imper-
ative verb is its irrealis form. However, the stem forms of verbs in the impera-
tive mood are also the forms that occur for verbs inflected to express an indirect
command (see below 7.1.4). This fact indicates that the underlying form for imper-
ative forms is a subjunctive wish – in other words, ‘You go!’ takes the grammatical
form of ‘(I want that) you go!’.
     For that reason, the stem forms of verbs inflected in the imperative are classi-
fied as subjunctive rather than irrealis, even though their realization in speech is
most often identical with the irrealis forms.","[222, 223, 224]"

3.4.1 Common adverbsTayap has a small closed set of common adverbs that specify the way in which the
action expressed by the verb is carried out. The full set is as follows:ainɨ           ‘like this’            ndagunɨ            ‘furtively’, ‘without

          ‘bring it running!’ (i.e. bring it right this minute, fast)Note also that (3-53h) has an adverb occurring between the verbs of a serial verb
construction.
     Like adjectives, common adverbs can function as verbs (Section 3.3.2). So just
as it is possible to inflect an adjective to say something like ‘it will be bad’,(3-54) aprorkɨtak
       apro -r- -kɨ        -tak
       bad -r- -irr -2sg.f|3sg.f.irr
       ‘it will get bad’ (The r after apro here and after supwáspwa in the next
       example is phonologically motivated; see Section 2.6.)Adverbs can also be inflected to produce sentences like the following:(3-55) a. supwáspwarkɨtak
          supwáspwa -r- -kɨ      -tak
          badly          -r- -irr -2sg.f|3sg.f.irr

          really -2sg.f|3sg.f.r -perf
          ‘it became the real thing’In addition to modifying verbs, adverbs can also modify noun phrases, as in the
following, in which ŋayor ‘really’ modifies the possessive NP ‘illness’:(3-56) kandawŋan munje ŋayor
       kandaw =ŋan munje ŋayor
       illness =poss man     really
       ‘a really sick man’

3.4.2 Adverbial functions of the suffix -kɨThe affix -kɨ (rarely -nɨ) has multiple functions. It is one of the three irrealis affixes
for intransitive verbs (see Section 5.4.2). It is also an intensifier (see Section 3.11).
In addition, it expresses adverbial meanings when it is affixed to the following
components:
(1) -kɨ can be affixed to nouns to express a distributive meaning; that is, that an
action or event takes place on more than one individual occasion, involves an
undetermined variety of the same kind of referents, or denotes the way in which
something is distributed. These are usually reduplicated:(3-57) a. orom -kɨ     orom -kɨ

express when an event occurred or will occur:
                                                                              Adverbs     77
General temporals:      anombi          ‘later on in the near future’
                        nunuk           ‘later’, ‘afterwards’
                        nirere          ‘a moment ago’, ‘in a minute’
                        rɨpam           ‘a long time previously’, ‘in the olden days’
                        rɨpɨm           ‘before’, ‘previously’
                        rɨpɨmkɨ         ‘quite a while ago’
                        rɨpɨmbarakɨ     ‘a fair while ago’ (not as long ago as rɨpɨmkɨ)Divisions of the day:   embeb           ‘just before dawn’ (4.30–5.30)
                        emb             ‘morning’ (5.30–7.00)
                        arawer          ‘daytime, early afternoon’ (7.00–16.00)
                        ŋgrag arawer    ‘late afternoon’ (16.00–17.00)
                        ŋgrag           ‘early evening’ (17.00–19.00)
                        ikur            ‘night’ (19.00–4.30)
The locative clitic =re can be used in its temporal function with these words to
specify the time of an action:(3-60) a. ikurre yim okɨtike
          ikur    =re      yim o           -kɨ -tike

            ‘they went into the jungle at the break of dawn’=re also carries the adverbial meaning of frequency when the temporal phrase it
creates is repeated. See below, Section 3.4.4.
    Calendrical time has the following nominal expressions:
     aro                    ‘day’
     arawer                 ‘day’, lit. ‘sun’
     karep                  ‘month’, lit. ‘moon’
     ŋgudumŋa kɨt/          ‘year’, lit. ‘Pleiades’
     mbiruŋa kɨt

Speakers younger than about forty know the words in the above list of days up to

(three days from now). The words for four and five days in the future are known
only by speakers over fifty. I recorded aŋgisakup (seven days from now) during
elicitation sessions with old fluent speakers in the 1980s. Nowadays the word is
obsolete, remembered by only a few of the oldest speakers in the village.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"
"Villagers’ debates and language shiftSomething similar to the ‘wind problem’ occurred with a word that I would have
thought was common and uncontroversial – the word for ‘rainbow’. One morning
344        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionaryafter a night of heavy rain, a large rainbow appeared in the sky. On my way to
wash my clothes in one of the village waterholes, I saw the rainbow and realized
that I didn’t know what it was called in Tayap. So I asked the first person I saw – a
fluent speaker of Tayap in his late thirties – what one calls a rainbow in Tayap.
     “Renbo”, he responded, without missing a beat.
     Um, no, I told him, that must be the Tok Pisin word – the Tayap word had to be
something else. The man told me that in that case, he didn’t know, and that I should
go ask his father, sixty-five-year-old Monei Mbanaŋ, who was my main language
informant at the time. I went off to find Monei and thus did my innocent query
launch a month of acrimonious debate from one end of the village to the other.
     I found Monei sitting on his veranda and I asked him the word for rainbow.
He pondered for awhile. He told me he couldn’t remember the word offhand; he
needed to think about it. He thought for several days. Finally, he told me that
‘rainbow’ had no single word in Tayap; instead, ‘rainbow’ was expressed by the
verb phrase akɨn tamtiek, ‘cloud is marked with color’. This sounded reasonable
to me, and I duly recorded it. But when I repeated it to other speakers to check
their reactions, I was universally met with disdain. “Em giaman” – ‘He’s lying’,
everyone sneered, using their favorite expression to dismiss another speaker’s
expertise in Tayap. Even though no one could think of the correct term themselves,
they all told me they knew that the phrase Monei had volunteered was wrong.
     Days went by and no one could come up with ‘rainbow’. Older villagers
explained to me that their parents and older relatives had warned them about
rainbows, saying they should never walk underneath one, because if they did,
their minds would become clouded and confused. But even though they remem-
bered these cautions, no senior speaker could recall the word for ‘rainbow’
that their parents and relatives had used while articulating them. The word for
‘rainbow’, villagers told me, “i hait” – it was hiding. (In the villagers’ defense, I
should note that rainbows are not exactly common occurrences in Gapun – I only
saw that one the entire eight months I was there in 2009).
     Eventually Monei’s old wife, Sopak Waiki, told me that she had a dream in
which the true word for ‘rainbow’ had been whispered to her by a dead ancestor.
The word, she revealed, was mɨnuomb – a word that otherwise means ‘large
round lake’. Sopak said that the way to say ‘rainbow’ in Tayap was to say akɨnnɨ
mɨnuomb utok, ‘a round lake appeared in the clouds’.
     I told other senior speakers of Sopak’s revelation. They were unmoved. “Em
giaman”, they all pronounced, impassively.
     A few days later, one of the oldest men in the village told me that he had
remembered the word – it was wagurmos.
     The other speakers’ judgement fell predictably: “Em giaman”, they all said.
They explained that wagurmos meant the white film one sees in the sky at night
                                          Villagers’ debates and language shift     345
– that is, the Milky Way. It doesn’t mean ‘rainbow’ at all. Many older speakers also
took the opportunity to disparage the linguistic knowledge of the old man who
had offered wagurmos. That speaker may be old, they said belittlingly, but he’s
“lapun nating” – he’s grown old without having learned anything. All he has,
people said, is “bebi sens” – the sense of a baby.
     Weeks passed and frustration grew. But finally, having heard about the
senior speakers’ search for ‘rainbow’, a young man in his 30s one day came and
told me that he had once heard his grandfather, Kruni Ayarpa, say the word for
‘rainbow’. Kruni had been one of my language informants in the 1980s; he died
in the early 1990s. For the last few decades of his life, Kruni had been universally
respected and vaguely feared as an elder who knew everything about Gapun’s
history and who spoke flawless and eloquent Tayap. The young man reported
that as a child, he had once been together with Kruni when women from the
neighboring village of Wongan mentioned rainbows, which are called mamor in
their Kopar language. They asked Kruni what the word in Tayap was. Kruni told
them that it was mamar.
     Rather than being a breakthrough, this word, too, was rejected. “It means
‘banana’”, all the old people responded dryly when, without telling them why, I
asked them to define mamar. And indeed, it does mean a kind of banana. But in
the end, unable to come up with a word or expression that satisfied them all, and
undoubtedly growing annoyed at my persistence in questioning them, the older
villagers begrudgingly agreed that mamar must be the word for ‘rainbow’ too,
since Kruni apparently had claimed it was.
     My own conclusion is that mamar probably was the Tayap word for ‘rainbow’.
Tayap and Kopar share quite a few nouns, because speakers of the two languages
have been in contact with one another for a very long time. The kind of slight
phonetic variation between mamor and mamar are common in the words shared
by the two languages. For example:                        Tayap                 Kopar
  crocodile             orem                  oreo
  cockatoo              kaimwa                keimwa
  turtle                pawp                  pup
  lorikeet              njijerɨk              njijerɨŋ
  hook                  pipiŋgabu             bibigabuFor those all those reasons, I have entered ‘rainbow’ as one of the definitions of
mamar. I recount the little epic of finally getting that word, though, in order to
illustrate the fact that not all of the entries contained in this dictionary will satisfy
all the current speakers of Tayap.
346        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionary     In fact, this inability to satisfy all the current speakers of a Tayap is a feature
of the language that may be contributing to its demise. I was continually struck by
how vigorously (and, to my mind, how gratuitously) senior speakers of Tayap dis-
counted and ridiculed one another’s linguistic competence. Early on, I stopped
trying to discuss Tayap in groups of old people because any discussion of any
aspect of the language would inevitably result in bickering. Speakers might even-
tually grouchily agree on whatever it was I was asking them about, but later on,
they would always arrange a private moment with me to heartily dismiss the
knowledge and opinions of their fellow speakers.
     While it escapes no one’s attention that Tayap is a tiny language spoken
nowhere else but in Gapun (and by Gapun villagers living in the neighboring
village of Wongan), knowledge about language is regarded as a private, rather than
a communal, possession. This way of thinking about language is an extension of
the villagers’ more general ethos of ownership. Gapun villagers would shake their
heads in absolute bewilderment at the persistent Western stereotypes about how
a rainforest-dwelling people like themselves supposedly eschew ownership and
share their natural resources in a kind of prelapsarian socialist ecological bliss.
     On the contrary. In Gapun, nothing is communal, nothing is equally owned
and shared by everyone. Everything – every area of land, every sago palm, every
coconut palm, every mango tree, every pot, plate, axe, machete, discarded spear
shaft, broken kerosene lamp, and every anything else one can think of – is owned
by someone (including people’s names and the right to bestow them, as well
as knowledge of myths, songs, and curing chants). Villagers guard their rights
of ownership energetically and they defend them loudly (see Kulick 1992 for an
extended discussion of this that is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago).
     This understanding of possession and ownership has consequences for lan-
guage: it means that the sociolinguistic truism of a common “shared” language
has little purchase in Gapun. In their own view, villagers don’t “share” a lan-
guage. Instead, each speaker owns his or her own version of the language. And
the older those speakers become, the more they regard their version as the proper
one and everyone else’s as “giaman” (false, a lie; takwat in Tayap). This absence
of a language ideology that regards a common language as something “shared”
means that speakers are predisposed to not regard the loss of Tayap as particu-
larly traumatic. Fluent elder speakers still have ‘their’ Tayap; if younger speakers
don’t possess a version of it as, well, “wari bilong ol”. That’s their problem.","[363, 364, 365, 366]"
"Object (O)
Transitivity in verbs is signaled by the presence of an object suffix that either
directly follows the verb stem, or, for certain verbs, that occurs between two dis-
continuous subject suffixes. Tayap has a number of distinct object suffixes that
signal person, number and TAM. These are discussed in Section 5.3.1.
     Generally speaking, verbs are formed by suffixing TAM, object (for transitive
verbs) and subject morphemes onto verb stems. The system is complicated by
the fact that many verbs express TAM partly or wholly through suppletion. This
feature of Tayap grammar is illustrated in example (5-1). In that example, note
how the verb stem alternates between po, when it expresses an action that has
actually occurred, and o, when it expresses an event that has not yet happened.
     As was mentioned above, main predicate verb stems never occur inde-
pendently, and they never occur without being inflected for status (realis/irre-
alis). Despite this, though, it is easy to identify the root form of a verb. All one
has to know is the verb’s negated form. For this reason, let us examine verbs by
looking at negation first.",[158]
"It is not always clear how to determine which object morpheme – the non-final
verb object morpheme or the other form – will be used in any given instance.
      So in tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana (repeated from (8-1)) notice that the non-final
object -at 3sg.m.nfo occurs after the first verb, and the form that occurs with
other verbs, -ŋgɨ 3sg.m.r.o occurs after the second non-final verb:(8-9) tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana
      tapr                          -at        kɨ    -ŋgɨ

        go_down.irr -irr 3sg.f.r -intent
        ‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’The subject of a complex predicate like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana is encoded on the
inflected final verb, and it is this final verb that would be negated to negate the
predicate. To see this clearly, below are examples of this same complex predicate
inflected for different subjects. Note the differences in the subject suffix (in bold)
just prior to the final intentional suffix – everything else in the verb remains the
same. Example (8-10d), repeated from (8-2), gives the negated verb, where, as
always, there is no subject marked.(8-10) a. tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨ -net                -ana

8.2.3 Verbs that always or usually occur only in svcs8.2.3.1 svcs with the grammaticalized verb kv ‘bring’, ‘take’
The verb stem kv only ever occurs as a non-final verb within a svc. It expresses
that an object will be brought to the deictic center or taken away from the deictic
center in a way that is specified by the verb of motion that follows it.
    Tayap has a number of verbs that express different ways of carrying objects.
They include:    andruwe ‘carry on head’
    erorar ‘carry on back’
    ser-(p)-e ‘carry in hand’
    tap ‘carry on shoulders’
    wuw ‘carry on one shoulder’Verbs like these express specific ways of carrying an object. The verb stem kv, on
the other hand, does not specify how an object is carried. It simply means ‘bring’
or ‘take’ in both the narrow sense of physically carrying something, and in the
more extended sense of, for instance, ‘bringing the visitors down (or taking them
down) to the end of the village to send them off’. Tayap speakers use the Tok Pisin
word “kisim” as a more or less exact equivalent.
     Unlike all other verbs in the language, kv never functions as a final verb of a
serial verb construction, nor indeed any other verb type:
– it never occurs without another verb following it in a serial verb construction;
– it is not marked for tense;
– it does not take subject morphemes (although it does take object marking);
– and it cannot be independently negated.","[254, 255]"
"1.4 Young people’s TayapIn addition to language recorded through formal elicitation sessions and tran-
scriptions of naturally occurring speech, this grammar and dictionary is also
informed by fifty-six narratives from forty five young people aged fourteen to
thirty that I collected and transcribed between July and November 2009.
     I elicited these narratives primarily to see whether villagers younger than
about thirty had any active command of Tayap at all. By mid-2009, after having
lived in Gapun twenty-four hours a day for more than three months, I found
that I was still unable to accurately judge this. The reason I had trouble assess-
ing younger villagers’ active competence in Tayap during this time was because
whenever I asked young people if they “save toktok long tok ples” (spoke Tayap),
they all told me, sure they did.
     The problem was, I never heard any of them doing so. Once in a while I would
hear a young person utter a few formulaic phrases in Tayap, but this was usually
done to mark a situation as funny, and it was usually accompanied and followed
by laughter. It also seemed to me that whenever villagers under twenty-five
mouthed even a short formulaic phrase in Tayap, their tone of voice shifted to
suggest that they were imitating or quoting someone else, usually to mock them
(a big man’s Voice of Authority, for example). Much the same happened whenever
I pressed the young people who told me that they spoke Tayap, and asked them
to tell me exactly what kind of things they said in the vernacular. In response,
they would list a few words like mum and tamwai (sago jelly and sago pancake,
respectively) and a few rudimentary formulaic phrases, such as the command to
hand over some betel nut or tobacco.
     At the same time, however, Tayap does continue to be heard throughout
Gapun. Women and men over fifty use it habitually (even if they continually
code-switch between Tayap and Tok Pisin), and a few men and women in their
mid-thirties and older also use Tayap very frequently, even when speaking to
their children. Even small children in the village understand the commands to
go and fetch things, hit dogs, get out of the way, stop crying, etc. that adults are
continually hollering at them.
18       1 The Tayap language and its speakers     Given that it was clear that Tayap was still used throughout Gapun, for a long
time I thought that perhaps the young people really were quite competent in the
vernacular, as they claimed to be. I fretted that I just never seemed to be in the
right place at the right time to hear them when they actually spoke it.
     I began to wonder whether the reason I wasn’t hearing young people telling
each other stories or asking each other questions in Tayap was because maybe
they spoke it mostly out of the earshot of older, more fluent speakers. Maybe they
felt ashamed that they weren’t speaking it completely flawlessly, I conjectured.
Or perhaps the vernacular, for them, had become tied to particular social events
like same-sex gossip or hanging out in the rainforest – speech situations that
only happened when young people were alone in groups and away from nosy and
critical parents and elders.
     To see whether any of this was in fact the case, I ended up spending a
great deal of time with young people of both sexes between the ages of four-
teen to twenty-five. I accompanied young men into the rainforest on frequent
occasions, to go looking for birds to shoot with arrows or slingshots, and also
when they went off together in groups to perform secret rituals that refresh
their bodies.
     I also spent a lot of time hanging out with young women. One place I made
a point of doing this was inside maternity huts. Maternity huts are small, flimsy,
hurriedly-constructed little houses on stilts, set on the periphery of the village,
often near areas that villagers go off into to urinate or defecate. Women ready to
give birth walk to special places in the rainforest, have their baby, then return
to these maternity huts, where they are supposed to stay for up to three months
(even though most young women these days find excuses to go back into their
usual houses after only a few perfunctory weeks). During the entire period a
woman is in a maternity hut, no man is supposed to visit her or even set eyes
upon her and her newborn baby because villagers believe that the quantities of
blood and uterine fluids discharged during childbirth make a woman and her
newborn infant “hot” – that is to say, scalding, dangerous. Females are not as
vulnerable to the effects of other women’s “heat” (since they are, themselves,
“hot”), and female visitors drop by a maternity hut throughout the day, usually
accompanied by their younger child siblings and their own babies, if they have
any. They bring food, water and gossip about the goings-on in the village from
which the new mother is temporarily excluded.
     It was not gender-appropriate for me to sit in the maternity huts with new
mothers and other women, but the villagers regarded my enthusiasm for doing
so as just a puzzling, whiteman eccentricity. Everyone in Gapun was convinced
that I was going to get a fatal case of asthma from allowing myself to come in such
close contact with the heat of women.
                                                        Young people’s Tayap      19
     With this kind of danger in mind, whenever I wondered aloud in Gapun
whether I might be coming down with a cold or a fever, a villager was always on
hand to ruefully shake his or her head and remind me how foolish I was to put
myself at risk of bronchial collapse by sitting next to a woman who had recently
given birth. Sure, I might take special white-people’s medicine to protect against
the ravages of vaginal heat, they told me (this is how they assumed I could survive
the blasts at all), but sooner or later, they just knew, I would start spewing blood.
     Despite their expectation that I would soon be coughing out my own lungs,
both women and men seemed to enjoy my visits in the maternity huts. Men
enjoyed them because I took digital photos of the new babies and willingly
showed them to them. Before I began doing this, no adult man had ever seen a
newborn, so they were all deeply curious. Women always welcomed me because
I brought gossip and stories. They also liked looking at the photos I took of them
and their babies. I usually also brought along some kerosene that could be put
into a tin lamp, thus sparing the new mother and her baby pitch-black nights in
a lonely, wind-rattled hut.
     Because I spent so many hours in the company of young women in places
like maternity huts, and of young men in places like the rainforest when they
performed intimate and lengthy ministrations together, I came to see, over the
months, that none of these young people ever used Tayap at all. All conversations
between young people under twenty-five, in all situations, were in Tok Pisin.
Young people use Tayap words that are common in the villagers’ speech, and
that often don’t have Tok Pisin equivalents (for example, words for various birds
and plants in the forest). And they do sometimes use short formulaic phrases,
to provoke humor or to “hide talk” from any non-villager who might be in their
company or within earshot. But that is all.
     Young people do not converse, narrate, gossip, argue, tell jokes, discuss
erotic experiences or do anything else at all in Tayap.
     Once I understood this, I became better able to make sense of the mutual
recrimination that arises whenever the topic of language shift comes up in villag-
ers’ conversations. Parents blame their children for not speaking Tayap. They say
in voices dripping with irony that their children have all turned white and there-
fore they only speak the language of white people – Tok Pisin. Young people,
when mocked in this way, snap back that it’s the parents’ own fault their children
don’t speak Tayap: if they had taught them Tayap, they would be able to speak it.
     Young men and women also told me that they don’t speak Tayap because
they are ashamed. “They laugh at us”, said one twenty-one-year-old man, refer-
ring to villagers in their forties and older. “They’ll say ‘Oh, he’s someone raised
in some other village’. Or, ‘Oh! A whiteman child who doesn’t know the village
language’. They’ll make fun of us. So it’s hard to answer in the vernacular and we
20        1 The Tayap language and its speakersget mixed up.” (“Ol i save lap long mipela, ol bai kirap tok, ‘Em wanpela mangi
bilong narapela hap ia’. O ‘Ye, waitman pikinini i no save long tok ples’. Na bai
ol i wokim pani gen. Em nau, hat long bekim long tok ples bai mipela paul ia.”)
     I became curious to know if the young people’s lack of Tayap, and their shame
about speaking it, was due to the fact that they simply didn’t command it. So to
try to assess this, I began asking groups of friends, two to three at a time, to come
into my house at night to narrate stories in Tayap. Because I knew by that time
that young people didn’t speak Tayap to one another or anyone else, I expected
this task to be like pulling teeth.
     Instead, to my great surprise, it was like slicing butter.
     Not only were young villagers eager to narrate; all but the very youngest of
them were also able to narrate in Tayap. Many of the narratives were short, and
most of them were scaffolded by the narrator’s same-sex friends, who sat on the
floor with them and helped the teller remember what things were called and figure
out how verbs were inflected. But what emerged in the narrative sessions was that
all young people in the village have some active competence in the vernacular, and
some of them have excellent active competence – even though they never use it.
     Those young people who exhibited the highest-level proficiency in their
Tayap narratives (defined as speakers who spoke relatively unhesitatingly, used
a variety of pronouns, verbal statuses and verbs of motion, and who had a broad
vocabulary) constitute a kind of speaker that has not been discussed in the lit-
erature on language death. They are not exactly “passive bilinguals”, because
they are capable of active production – in a few cases, of relatively advanced
active production (Tayap Text 3, narrated by a twenty-five-year-old woman, is an
example of just how advanced).
     Nor are these young women and men quite the same as what the linguist
Nancy Dorian, in her work on language death in Scottish Gaelic communities,
once labeled “semi-speakers” (Dorian 1981). The young people of Gapun are
like the Gaelic semi-speakers that Dorian described in that they have perfect
passive competence and perfect communicative competence in the vernacular:
they understand everything said to them and they respond in culturally appro-
priate ways. But unlike Dorian’s semi-speakers (and also unlike the Australian
Dyirbal semi-speakers discussed in Schmidt 1985), young people in Gapun do not
use the vernacular in conversations with fluent speakers. On the contrary, with
the exception of lexical items and a few formulaic phrases like those mentioned
above, they never use it at all. The narratives I collected in 2009 are the only
times in their lives that the young people I recorded have ever told an entire story
in Tayap, and unless I return to Gapun and record some more, or unless some
miracle happens and the vernacular experiences a sudden renaissance, those
sessions in my house are likely the last time that anyone under twenty five will
ever even attempt to narrate an entire story in Tayap.

    Rather than calling them “passive bilinguals” or “semi-speakers”, a more
accurate name for this category of speaker might be “passive active bilingual”.
The convolutedness of that label seems fitting to describe a speaker who pos-
sesses sufficient grammatical and communicative competence in a second lan-
guage to use that language, but who never actually does use it, because social
and cultural factors make it unnecessary or undesirable to do so.
    Of particular relevance for this grammar is that there is a steady and stage-
bound grammatical erosion from passive active bilinguals to increasingly less
competent passive bilinguals. Some of this erosion includes the following:–   The five transitive verb classes become collapsed into the morphologically
    simplest conjugation class, class 5.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"
"3.4.4 Adverbials of frequency and distribution and ‘not yet’Two adverbials in Tayap express frequency and distribution (-re), and the tem-
poral relationship ‘not yet’ (ŋgo wákare). Note the formal parallel with the loca-
tive =re (see Section 3.4.3 above and Section 4.4); presumably these forms, while
having different functions, have the same origin. The suffix -re occurs on nouns,
and always involves reduplication, as the following examples show.-re ‘every’(3-64) a. Yu nimenda nirakkut arore arore. Rorsem aikindaka ambukenɨ
          nirakkut? Hariap kwik nirakkut.

            ‘he hasn’t spoken yet’3.4.5 Elevational and positional adverbialsThe relative geographical position of objects and people is expressed in Tayap
much more frequently than it is in a language like English. When leaving
someone’s company, for example, one doesn’t just say ‘I’m going’, but rather,
‘I’m going up (in the direction of the rainforest)’ or ‘I’m going down (in the
direction of the mangrove lagoon)’. Similarly, if you have just arrived back
in Gapun from a trip to the village of Wongan, and someone asks you where
you have been, the correct answer is not ‘I was in Wongan’, but ‘I was down
in Wongan’.
     Elevational and positional relationships are lexically encoded in Tayap’s rich
set of verbs of motion, virtually all of which are being lost because of their irreg-
ular inflectional patterns (see Section 6.2.3). But Tayap also has a set of two free-
standing elevationals and seven positionals that are used to pinpoint the location
of an object or a person.
     Four of these are oriented according to a spatial array consisting of two axes.
                                                                   Adverbs      81

MANGROVE LAGOON                        down sire
     The vertical axis refers to the spatial elevationals of ‘up’ and ‘down’, for
instance being up in a tree or down on the ground.
     The horizontal axis refers to the geographical relationship between the rain-
forest and the mangrove lagoon. The mangrove lagoon that villagers have to cross
to get to the neighboring village of Wongan runs to the sea and lies to the north
of Gapun. The rainforest, in which the villagers live and into which they walk
every day to find sago palms to process and game to hunt, lies all around the
village, but most of the vast areas of their traditional land lies roughly south of
Gapun. In relation to the mighty Sepik River, which can be seen from the top of
the mountain where Gapun village was situated until after World War II, the man-
grove lagoon is ‘downstream’, and the rainforest is ‘upstream’. This is the sense
in which villagers say they went ‘down’ to Wongan and then came back ‘up’ to
Gapun. These directionals are relative to one another, so that when one has gone
‘up’ into the rainforest, one comes ‘down’ to Gapun village when one returns.
Note that the terms also cover all space within the village.
     The five other freestanding positionals are:    ari   ‘below’, in the sense of ‘down below’ on a slope
    ase   ‘beside’, ‘on the edge of’, ‘on the periphery of’
    aro   ‘inside’, in the sense of ‘enveloped in or covered by’
    ato   ‘outside’, ‘on the exterior of’
    osi   ‘on the other side’So, for example, in response to the question ‘Where is it?’, one might respond in
any of the following ways:

They can also be used as verbs in serial verb constructions, indicating motion, for
example (see Section 8.2):(3-69) yimbar ŋaŋan mbɨukuasetak
       yimbar ŋaŋan mbɨu -ku                   -ase -tak
       canoe mine pull.r -3sg.f.r.o            -edge -2sg.f|3sg.f.r.s
       ‘She pulled my canoe outside’ (i.e. she pulled it from inside the rainforest
       out into the open)In addition to the freestanding elevationals and positionals, Tayap also has a
number of complex positionals, all but one of which (mborki) are nouns attached
with the locative clitic =nɨ.    imin=nɨ          ‘inside’ or ‘underneath’ (lit. ‘belly’ + loc)
    kandaŋ=nɨ        ‘under’, ‘at the base of’ (lit. ‘base’ + loc)
    mbokak=nɨ        ‘on top of’ (lit. ‘surface’ + loc)
    mborki=nɨ        ‘outside’, ‘visible, out in the open’
    mbwar=nɨ         ‘behind’ or ‘on’ (lit. ‘back’ + loc)
    nunuk=nɨ         ‘behind’ (lit. ‘back side’ + loc)
    orom=nɨ          ‘in the middle’ (lit. ‘middle’ + loc)
    raw=nɨ           ‘facing’ or ‘in front of’ (lit. ‘nose’ + loc)
    sek=nɨ           ‘underneath’ (lit. ‘underside’ + loc)
    taw=nɨ           ‘beside’ (lit. ‘side’ + loc)
The above positionals are nouns that can occur on their own – so one can say:(3-70)   raw =nɨ         aŋgi wuk
         nose =loc dx.f be.3sg.f.r
         ‘it’s in front’But speakers also frequently combine locative positionals like rawnɨ with the free-
standing elevationals and positionals, as well as more complex elements like the
possessive-marked noun in (3-71a–c), to specify location. One of the tests I did for
positionals was to put a plastic box in the middle of my floor and then put a torch
(i.e. a flashlight) in various positions in, under, behind, etc. the box. Some of the
positionals I elicited in this way are as follows (Note: tos ‘torch’ and kontena ‘box’
or ‘container’ are Tok Pisin words):
84        3 Word classes(3-71)   a. tos     kontena =ŋa         mbwar =nɨ  wo wuk

            ‘the torch is underneath the box’In addition to the elevationals and positionals discussed above, Tayap has two
further spatial adverbials that denote relative distance: kemrak ‘far away’ and
menjikan ‘nearby’. Examples are:(3-72)   a. ŋɨ ŋgɨnana kemrak puŋgot
            ŋɨ       ŋgɨ   = nana kemrak       puŋgot

            ‘the plate is there near your leg’3.5 PronounsTayap has a single set of pronouns that occur in three different cases: absolutive,
ergative and possessive.
     The possessive pronouns are formed by adding the possessive clitic = ŋa(n)
to the absolutive-case pronouns (with some irregularities), and the ergative pro-
nouns are formed by adding the nominal ergative clitics (see Section 4.3) to the
absolutive forms, again with some irregularities. Note that bound pronominal
forms are listed below and discussed in Section 5.3.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104]"
