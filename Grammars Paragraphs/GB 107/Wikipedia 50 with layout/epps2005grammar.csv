                 (LG-O.8)       The Existential negator pãÙ can co-occur with other negative particles. In example(54), the speaker uses the negative particle nQ¤ (§16.1.7) to reinforce negative pãÙ whenrelating what he has been told by Catholic missionaries. In (55), someone’s assertion pãÙ!‘(there are) none!’ is contradicted by another speaker via the negative Identity particle/a‡p (see §16.3 below); note that the clause-level ‘contradictory’ nature of /a‡p is such thatthis double negative results in a positive, as opposed to the use of reinforcing negativeparticle nQ¤ in (54). Finally, although pãÙ cannot itself take the negative verbal suffix-nˆ¤h, both existential and verbal negation occur together in the same sentence in example(56); here the two negatives are conceptually completely independent of each other.

Identity negative /a‡pThe negative particle /a‡p has the function of contradicting an assertion or negating theidentity of a nominal entity (‘this is not an X’).

"        The most widely used negative emphasis marker or intensifier is the verbalparticle mún. This form follows Negative -nˆ¤h with verbs, adjectives, and adverbials. Bycontrast, in affirmative clauses the variants muhún (which occurs in the Barreira dialectregion and is there formally distinguished from negative mún) and mún (Tat Deh dialectarea; both positive and negative) function as intensifiers with adjectives, but are notgrammatical with verbs (see §15.1.2). Use of this negative emphasis form yields suchadjectival and adverbial expressions as pay-nˆ¤h mún ‘not bad at all’ ~‘good, pretty’(example 33),185 and verbal forms like hipãh-nˆ¤h mún (know-NEG INTS2) ‘(I) don’t knowat all’ and those in (34-35):(33)    yˆ‚-n’ˆ‡h=hin          pay-nˆ¤h mún          t ˆh     bˆ¤/-ˆ¤h

The mostcommonly used intensifier with affirmative clauses (-Vcáp) rarely occurs with negatives,although this combination is possible, as illustrated by (37).

16.1.7. Reinforced negation with nQ¤Hup uses an additional negative particle nQ¤ to mark a strongly negative clause. Thisparticle always occurs together with and reinforces some other negative marker; this isusually the Verbal suffix -nˆ¤h, as in (38-39), but it may also be the Existential negativeparticle pãÙ (see §16.2) or Counterfactual -tQ‚/- (see §15.2). Such reinforced negation isfairly common—though far from ubiquitous—and is used by both older and youngerspeakers.

Reinforced negation with nQ¤ is used fairly consistently to express a ‘neither…nor’relationship between constituents:
(40)    yˆkán         nQ¤       cçkw’´‡t   /ˆd-nˆ¤h-ˆp
        over.there    NEG:R Tukano         speak-NEG-DEP

                NEG:R Portuguese       understand-NEG-DEP
                nor understanding Portuguese, (there I arrived).’ (PC.1)        The form nQ¤ is clearly a borrowing from Tukano, and is identified as such bysome Hup speakers themselves. In Tukano, a strong negative is likewise conveyed bydouble negative marking in the clause, involving the negative particle neê and the verbplus negative suffix (cf. Ramirez 1997: 154), and this property of double negation tomark a strong negative is common to East Tukanoan languages generally. According toAikhenvald (2002: 134-5), a nearly identical emphatic double negation strategy—involving the particle ne and the negated verb—also exists in Tariana, and can beattributed to language contact between Tariana and East Tukanoan languages. The use ofthe same negative strategy and form in Hup is clearly a result of its involvement in theVaupés linguistic area. However, the parallelism is not complete in Hup; nQ¤ cannotstand alone in Hup to mean ‘no’, as it can in Tukano and Tariana (Aikhenvald 2002:134).","[903, 904, 905]"

constructions, one negative and one affirmative, which function as two predicates (cf.§9.2); for example, /ˆd-nˆ¤h (tˆh) wQd-hám-áy (speak-NEG [3sg] eat-go-DYNM) ‘(he’s)going and eating (simultaneously) without speaking’, or /ˆd-wQd-nˆ¤h (tˆh) hám-áy(speak-eat-NEG [3sg] go-DYNM) ‘(he’s) going along without eating or speaking’. Thisco-presence of a negative and an affirmative verbal predicate—where the fullyaffirmative counterpart would be expressed by a single verb compound—is common inHup (examples 14-16).

Thus in example (17), the negative of ‘sing loudly’ or ‘make noisesinging’ remains a verb compound, even though consultants judge it to be neutral as towhether the singing itself continues or not. Similarly, the negation in (18-19) has scope
                                                                                                    881

           ‘He forbids them to come in here.’ (OS)           As noted above, the Negative suffix -nˆ¤h typically has scope only over the verbphrase in which it appears. However, when clause coordination involves a string ofsequential activities (marked with the Sequential suffix -yó/, which is itself incompatiblewith -nˆ¤h; see §16.1.5 below), the interpretation of negative scope appears to be moreflexible. Example (20) comes from a speech delivered to the community, and lists aseries of activities that women are expected to do to carry out the planting of manioc;only the last verb carries the negation, but the utterance was interpreted to mean thatwomen do none of these things (without some involvement on the part of their husbands).","[896, 897, 898]"
"16.1. Verbal Negative -nˆ¤hHup prefers a morphological strategy for the negation of clauses. In most cases, thisinvolves a single negative marker -nˆ¤h (although in special cases two negative markerscan occur; see §16.1.7 below), which occurs as a suffix on the verb stem. Use of theform -nˆh is limited exclusively to negation of the verb phrase predicate (which mayinclude predicate adjectives, but not predicate nominals).
                                                                                              875
           Formally, -nˆ¤h usually occurs as a verbal consonant-initial Boundary Suffix,which receives primary (word-level) stress within the verb word; however, it can befollowed by some other Boundary Suffixes, in which context it is best considered anInner Suffix. The final [h] of -nˆh is usually clearly audible (especially when followed bya vowel-initial Boundary Suffix), but is occasionally dropped in fast speech. Finally,Negative -nˆ¤h is nearly identical to the Possessive marker nˆ‡h (see §5.2), but confusiondoes not arise given their distinct tone values and their complementary distribution onverbs and nouns, respectively. It is also homonymous with the verb root nˆ¤h- ‘be like’(cf. §10.2.2.1), but because this verb—like all verb roots—is usually obligatorilyfollowed by a Boundary Suffix, the chance of confusion is again minimized.18316.1.1. Verbal negation in main clausesIn declarative clauses, negation with -nˆ¤h is a nearly symmetric strategy vis-à-vis thepositive clause: in most cases, the negative clause is structurally almost identical to itspositive counterpart, except that the negative marker usually takes the place of the(otherwise obligatory) Boundary Suffix on the verb stem in the affirmative clause. Whilenot all Boundary Suffixes are incompatible with Negative -nˆh (in particular, theDependent marker -Vp and the Interrogative -V/ can follow -nˆh), the most common
183
      Like any verb stem, nˆh- ‘be like’ can be followed by the Negative suffix:
            tˆ¤h=/íp=yˆ¤/   tˆh bahad-nˆh-nˆ¤h
           3sg=father=TEL 3sg     appear-be.like-NEG
           ‘He doesn’t look like his father.’ (EL)
                                                                                       876
suffixes in affirmative main clauses—Dynamic -Vêy and Declarative -Vêh, amongothers—are almost always replaced by -nˆh (cf. §16.1.5 below).","[891, 892, 893]"
"16.2. Existential negative pãÙA second, distinct strategy of negation in Hup involves the negative particle pãÙ. Thisstrategy is used exclusively to express negation of a nominal entity, specifically relatingto the negation of its existence or presence (negative identity is handled by the particle/a‡p, see §16.3 below). The negative marker pãÙ stands on its own as a completepredicate, ‘there does not exist’, and has scope over the noun phrase:
(41)    /ˆ¤n=dú=d’´h        kot/ah=có/=yˆ/      húp      pãÙ,
        1pl=ancestor=PL    before=LOC=TEL       human    NEG:EX
        ‘In the time before our ancestors there were no people,                cçkw’´‡t=d’´h      pãÙ,      miná/=d’´h      pãÙ…
                Tukano=PL           NEG:EX   Desano=PL      NEG:EX
                no Tukanos, no Desanos…’ (LG.29)The noun phrase negated by pãÙ may be made up of a noun and an adjective modifier, asin (42a). Compare this to the verbal negation strategy, in which the adjective + -nˆ¤htogether form the predicate, and the negative particle has scope only within the predicate,as in (42b).
(42)    a)      [tiyi‡/   po‡g]   pãÙ
                 man      big     NEG:EX

                man       big-NEG
                ‘The man is not big.’        As a predicative particle, pãÙ frequently occurs by itself as a complete utterance (inreference to an entity that is the topic of the discourse), meaning ‘(it’s) not here; (there) isnone’. It can likewise act as a negative interrogative predicate, as in pãÙ tˆ¤h? (NEG:EX3sg) ‘is there none?’ or ‘is he/she/it not here?’. The affirmative parallel of pãÙ is the verbni- ‘be, exist’ (compare examples 43a-b), whose negated form ni-nˆ¤h (be-NEG) isoccasionally substituted for pãÙ, although this is not common (43c).

These include some that can occur withvarious parts of speech, such as the Inchoative (example 44) and the Perfective (example45; note that this form of the Perfective also occurs with nominals), but also some that arefound exclusively with verbs, such as the Habitual particle (example 46).(44)    pídiya=hin nutQ‡n           pãÙ-ay-áh           /ãêh-ãêp

       ‘There’s never a place for me to stay when I arrive.’ (EL)       However, pãÙ is unlike a verb in several crucial respects. In particular, pãÙ differsfrom all true members of the verb class in that it is not able to take most BoundarySuffixes, and typically occurs alone in uninflected form. Its predicative identity is alsonot sufficient grounds for attributing verbal status to pãÙ, since adjectives and nouns canalso form complete predicates in Hup. Thus pãÙ is here considered a predicative particlein its own right, rather than a member of the verb class or any other word class in Hup.","[906, 907, 908]"

This is consistent with thecross-linguistic tendency for imperative environments to often require special negativeconstructions (cf. Kahrel 1996, Miestamo 2003: 20). In Hup negative imperatives, thenegated verb phrase acts structurally as an embedded adverbial clause (usually—thoughnot obligatorily—marked with the adverbializing =yˆ/ enclitic), while the main clause isthe imperative form of the verb ni- ‘be’:

16.1.2. Verbal negation in subordinate clausesRelative clauses in Hup (see §18.2.3) undergo negation of the verb phrase just as mainclauses do. The Negative suffix takes the Dependent marker -Vp (example 9) and otherrelative clause morphology (10).

       For other types of subordination, a copula construction with the verb ni- ‘be,exist’ is an optional strategy for forming a negative, as in (13a). An alternative non-copula construction and corresponding affirmative form are given in (13b-c).

Verbal negation and scope within the verb compound and the verb phraseAs the examples above show, negation with -nˆ¤h usually negates the entire verbalpredicate. In the case of compound verbs, however, negating the compound assertions ofthe corresponding affirmative clause may require varying treatment of the compounddepending on the level of semantic integration of its combined stems.","[893, 894, 895, 896]"

Verbal negation and modifiers (adjectives, adverbs, quantifiers)As discussed in §3.1.3 and §10.1, predicative adjectives in Hup are formally very similarto verbs. Their behavior in negative contexts is consistent with this—they undergoclausal negation in just the same way as do verb stems:(22)   pˆhˆ¤t     d´b-nˆ¤h=mQh

Adjectives serving an adverbial function (see §10.2) usually appear within thecompound verb in negative contexts, as in (24-25a)—whereas they typically occuroutside the compound in affirmative clauses, as in (25b).(24)   /ˆ¤n=tQ‚êh=d’´h-ay            yúw-úh,     /çm-naw-nˆ¤h

                  fast    3sg   run-DYNM
                  ‘He runs fast.’ (EL)       There are no inherently negative quantifiers in Hup; however, the clause-levelquantifier form pˆ¤d (‘all, each of’; see §6.5.2) can occur in negative clauses:(26)   /ˆ¤n=hin          tˆ¤h-a‡n “nQ¤n!” nç-nˆ¤h      pˆ¤d

       ‘As for us, we never/ none of us told her “come!”’ (P.Sp.103)16.1.5. The interaction of verbal negation and other grammatical systemsIt is cross-linguistically common for negation to interact with other grammatical systemswithin a language, such as tense and aspect (cf. Aikhenvald and Dixon 1998, Miestamo2003: 18). In Hup, whether a clause is marked as affirmative or negative may influencethe choices to be made in other grammatical systems.","[898, 899, 900]"
"       Inherently negative verbs in Hup include muy- ‘not get any, fail’, as in examples(74-76). This verb can occur in compounds, and can itself take clausal negation (76). Itis almost certainly borrowed from Tukano, in which the near-identical form muiﬂ hasessentially the same meaning as its Hup counterpart (cf. Ramirez 1997b: 108).(74)   d’´wyˆ¤/      hç‚Ùp    múy-úy           /ãêh-ãêh

(77)   yam-yãhã/-yˆ¤/!
       sing-stop-TEL.IMP
       ‘Stop singing!’ (EL)
                                                                                        900Finally, the verbal Counterfactual marker -tQ‚/- can be considered inherently negative, asdiscussed in §15.2 and in §16.1.7 above; it can even occur with the reinforcing negativemarker nQ¤, as in (79) (from a discussion of evil spirits).

Comparative Note       Negation in Hup’s sister language Nadëb has been described in some detail byWeir (1984, 1994), who observes that Nadëb has a remarkably complex set of strategiesfor negation, which reveal some typologically unusual features. For example, the onlynegative constructions reported to have direct affirmative equivalents involve dependentor embedded clauses and imperatives (Weir 1994: 291). Also, the negative marker usedin clausal negation has a nominal identity, which is typologically extremely rare—in fact,Nadëb may represent the only example of such a strategy (cf. Miestamo 2003).","[916, 917]"
"       The most common use of /a‡p is as an identity negator with predicate nominals, asin examples (57-60). The negative particle has scope over the entire noun phrasepredicate.

While /a‡p must follow the predicate, the subject of the predicate nominal clause(when explicitly stated) is free to follow the negated predicate (example 61a), just as it isin the corresponding affirmative clause (61b). This example clarifies that /a‡p is not itselfpredicative, unlike the existence/presence negator pãÙ discussed above.

               ‘This is a big man.’ (EL)Example (61a) can be understood to mean either ‘this is a man who is not big’ or ‘this isnot a man at all’. However, the same clause negated with -nˆ¤h has quite differentconstituency, and can therefore only mean ‘this man is not big’ (61c). The negation ofidentity in (61a) can also be contrasted with the negation of existence/presence in (61d).
       c)      núp tiyi/ [pog]-nˆ¤h

               man        big       NEG:EX
               ‘There is no big man.’ (EL)       The Identity Negator /a‡p is not found inside subordinate clauses. However, it canbe used to negate a subordinate clause acting as a nominalization:
(62)   tˆh wQ¤d-Qp /a‡p             páh           yúw-úh !

       When the negative particle /a‡p is postposed to a verbal predicate, it functionsto contradict an entire assertion, as in examples (63-65). This negation strategy carriesmore contradictory force than the more common verbal negation strategy with the suffix-nˆ¤h. With verbal predicates, /a‡p must follow the fully inflected verb (but is notconstrained by the type of inflection). The expression in (64) would be used withchildren who are begging to eat someone else’s bananas, in order to impress upon themthat the rightful owner is a serious possessor and the coveted item is not up for grabs.

"Note that all of these emphatic or intensifier forms also occur in affirmative clauses, butin certain cases their function in negative clauses is distinct from their function inaffirmatives.",[903]
"Another common strategy relies on a predicative particle (pãÙ), which is used as anexistential negator with noun phrases. Finally, the third negation strategy makes use ofan ‘identity negator’ particle (/a‡p) that can function both to contradict the entire clauseand to negate an individual constituent within the clause—often relating specifically tothe identity of a nominal entity. Because of this latter function of negating a constituent,the particle /a‡p is not—unlike Hup’s other negative strategies—exclusively a clausalnegator.",[891]

       ‘Yes, he slept there.’ (JA.73)       There is no general word for ‘no’ in Hup; however, the negative predicativeparticle pãÙ (see §16.2) can be used in response to questions dealing with the presence orexistence of nominal entities:

The primarymorphological characteristics marking the simple imperative are several. These includethe lack of any Boundary Suffix on the verb (such that this clause type can be consideredthe unmarked member of the set in Table 17.1 above, contrasting with Dynamic,interrogative, declarative, and subordinate clauses), and obligatory high (falling) tone.","[971, 972, 973]"
"This example also illustrates the fact that evidentials—as clause- or predicate-levelmarkers themselves, indicating the speaker’s source of information—generally follow thenegative particle.

A negative response or refusal typically requiresone of the strategies already discussed here, such as a verb phrase negated with -nˆh(either echoed or summarized as nˆh-nˆ¤h [be.like-NEG] ‘not like that’), a noun phrase withthe existence negator pãÙ ‘none, not here’ (which, as discussed, can stand alone), or a
                                                                                            899
generic demonstrative or other noun with ‘identity’ negation (e.g. yˆ¤t /a‡p ‘not thus’),depending on the type of negative required.","[913, 914, 915, 916]"
"Reduplication—both on the lexical level (see §4.5 and §12.9.3) and on the clausal level(§18.2.2)—is an iconic representation of a repetitive action. Also, a number of words inHup are clearly of onomatopoeic origin, and in some cases probably continue to have anonomatopoeic association to the referent in the minds of speakers. Examples includeverbs relating to noisy bodily functions, most notably hatci‚h- ‘sneeze’, for which there isa corresponding ideophone (hatci‚h!) that is identical to the verb stem. Some bird namesare also onomatopoeic and are based on the bird’s call, such as wçhwQ‡w ‘dove’.

16. Negation
       Negation in Hup is relatively complex. Three distinct strategies for expressingnegation are available, involving at least four different negative markers. These are allforms of clausal or ‘standard’ negation, which produces the opposite truth value in theclause (cf. J. Payne 1985, Miestamo 2003). The most common or basic form of negationin Hup involves a negative suffix (-nˆ¤h) that is used exclusively with verbal predicates.","[890, 891]"

15.1. Degree markersHup has a large and heterogeneous set of markers that act as intensifiers and function tomodify the degree of the assertion. Most associate with both verbal and adjectivalpredicates, and several can also occur with nominal constituents. The intensifier particlesare functionally akin to many of the markers of focus and emphasis (see §15.2 and §15.3below).","[822, 823, 824]"
"       The strategies and morphemes found in Nadëb appear (at least superficially) tohave little in common with those in Hup. One possible cognate is the Nadëb post-verbalparticle manˆh, which bears some resemblance to the Hup Verbal Negative suffix -nˆh;however, in Nadëb this negative particle is used exclusively in imperative clauses.
                                                                                           901
        A possible cognate with Hup pãÙ is found in Dâw. According to S. Martins(1994: 163), verbal negation in Dâw involves the enclitic -E‚h, and nouns undergoexistential negation via a combination of this form with the nominal predicate marker ma,resulting in the form mEh. This particle combines with nouns in much the same way asdoes Hup pãÙ; for example, compare Dâw lay’ mEh (fishhook NEG) ‘there aren’t anyfishhooks’ with the same construction in Hup: hç‚pk´¤k pãÙ (fishhook NEG:EX). If futurework reveals that the Hup and Dâw forms are actually cognates, this will provide someinsight into the historical source of Hup pãÙ. Comparative work on the systems ofnegation in these related languages awaits investigation.","[917, 918]"
"14.2.1. Counterfactual in conditional expressionsCounterfactual -tQ)/- typically occurs in the apodosis (‘then’ or consequent clause) of abiclausal construction encoding an ‘if-then’ relationship.

TheCounterfactual expresses the unrealized or unrealizable status of the condition, and is

preferred in explicitly hypothetical situations, where the condition cannot be met or isnot expected to be met within the relevant time frame:

       (LG-O.12)       Counterfactual marking is typically absent where the condition is expected to beor is regularly met (see §14.1 above), but it is required when the conditional situation isobviously hypothetical. Thus (15), with an unmarked second clause, is inappropriate:

Rather, the Counterfactual itself is to be interpreted as inherently negative or atleast neutral regarding negation (see §16.4 and below). Clauses expressing conditional,hypothetical negative events (e.g. ‘she wouldn’t speak your language’) are phrasedexactly like those expressing positive events (e.g. ‘she would speak your language’), andthe negative/positive reading (i.e. whether or not the activity would be expected to takeplace if the hypothetical condition were realized) must be taken from the context:

       (B-Cv.1-4)Accordingly, while the best translation of (19) is negative, the appropriate positiveresponse would also use the Counterfactual: /ˆd-tQ‚ê/-Q‚êy! (speak-CNTRFCT-DYNM) ‘Iwould speak (it)!’
                                                                                                            744
       While Counterfactual -tQ)/- patterns like a typical Inner Suffix in combinationwith verbal predicates, it can also occur with predicate nominals. In this environment,the copula ni- is an option:
(20)   núp=/i‚h    b’óy-op=/i‚h      ni-tQê‚/-Q‚êy                 yQ‚êh

       ‘This man would have been/ was almost a teacher.’ (EL)However, a verbal construction is not required for expressing counterfactuality; instead,-tQ)/- (followed by Frustrative yQ)êh) may directly follow the noun, without a copula.","[758, 759, 760, 761]"
"       Finally, the Verbal Negative suffix -nˆ¤h is ungrammatical with the Future suffixes-teg / -te- (although it can occur with -teg when this suffix acts as a purpose marker in adependent clause, as in example 13b above; see §13.1). This apparently idiosyncraticaspect of Hup grammar probably has a historical explanation relating to the nominalorigin of these future suffixes, as discussed in the Historical Note in §13.1. In order toexpress a negative future event, Hup relies on two alternative constructions. The mostcommon involves the Inchoative marker -ay, as in (31) (but note that this combinationcan in some cases be used for a current, on-going event, so its future reading is impliedrather than entailed). The Future Contrast particle tán provides a second option forexpressing negative future, as in example (32).

    Note that -yˆ/ appears to be sensitive to word-level stress patterns; it is unstressed when it follows a
stressed syllable, but stressed following an unstressed syllable.
                                                                                           1026
       Telic =yˆ/ can optionally follow the Dependent marker -Vp on an adverbialclause (cf. §18.2.4.1), as in examples (139-140). In these examples, =yˆ/ apparentlycontributes emphasis semantics to the adverbial expression, much as it does whenassociating with nominal arguments within the clause:
(139) [tˆ¤h-a‡n /éy-ep]=yˆ¤/   tˆh   wˆd-ye-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤h

       Elias=FOC      drink-lose.consciousness-DEP=TEL go-DECL
       ‘Elias went while drunk.’ (B.Cv.136)When the adverbial clause marked with the Dependent marker follows the main clause—a non-canonical position (in contrast to the above examples, where it precedes the mainclause)—it is usually marked with Telic =yˆ/, and some consultants even judge this extraadverbial marker as near-obligatory here. In this context, =yˆ/ apparently functions tomark the dependent clause as adverbial vis-à-vis the preceding main clause, despite theiratypical order. This is the case in example (141) (in which =yˆ/ also occurs on severalother adverbial expressions within the same utterance).
(141) yˆ¤t=yˆ/     /am hç‡t/ah=yˆ‡/ /am=/in nˆ‡h          b’ç‡t-ç¤h,   [/am kéy-ep]=yˆ¤/

       ‘Thus in front of you will be your mother’s roça, as you’ve seen it (before).’
       (H.TY.83)       The marker =yˆ/ has a similar adverbial-marking function in (142), in which itoccurs on (otherwise morphologically unmarked) adverbial expressions that follow themain clause, including an adverbial formed from the predicative negative particle pãÙ.

This is especially common in negative imperativeexpressions, in which the imperative mood and the negation cannot be expressed in thesame clause; usually, therefore, the negative must be realized as an adverbial clause, andthe imperative is marked on the ‘dummy’ verb ni- ‘be’, as in (143) (cf. §17.5.1).","[1042, 1043, 1044]"
"       However, Hup does have several inherently negative lexical items andexpressions, in addition to the negative particles already discussed in this chapter. Thefixed negative phrase /ám ya/a‡pa/ is commonly used in response to questions to mean ‘Idon’t know’. Its etymology is obscure, but it appears to involve the second personsingular pronoun /ám, and possibly the form ya/a‡p ‘that’s all; that much’.",[916]
"       Negative clauses require a special imperative construction, in which the negativepredicate functions as an adverbial clause (usually marked as such by the adverbial/Telicenclitic =yˆ/, see §10.2), together with the affirmative imperative form of the verb ni-‘be’, which acts as the main clause. This produces the construction [Verb-nˆ¤h=yˆ/ níh](Verb-NEG=TEL be.IMP) (example 185; see also §16.1.5). The imperative ‘be’ canoccasionally be dropped (example 186), and the entire construction (-nˆ¤h=yˆ/ níh) isfrequently shortened to –ninih (example 187), especially when the subject is singular(since singular subjects are usually deleted in imperative clauses).

"15.1.2. Intensifiers mún / muhúnThis intensifier, a particle, occurs with predicate adjectives, adverbials, and verbs,although in the case of verbs it is restricted to negative constructions involving the VerbalNegative suffix -nˆ¤h (see also §16.1.6). The form of this intensifier is also subject tovariation. Speakers in the Tat Deh dialect area pronounce it as mún in both positive(adjectival) and negative (verbal and adjectival) expressions. In Barreira, however, aformal distinction is maintained between the positive form, pronounced muhún, and theverbal negative mún. It is more likely that muhún is the older form and that mún is a

15.3.8. Acquiescence particle béThis particle, like the two described above, is poorly understood. It occurs quitefrequently in the expression h´‡/ bé ‘OK!’ where it marks acquiescence to an imperative(while affirmative h´‡/ by itself can signal either acquiescence or an affirmative answerto a question). This is illustrated by speaker B’s response to A’s imperative in example(170):(170) A: nˆN         pˆnˆN-d’´h-áy=mah,            tˆ¤h-a‡n!

In this case, it may indicateacquiescence in the sense that the speaker has made up his mind to do something aftersome deliberation; however, this is as yet unclear. It is hoped that future investigationwill shed more light on the functions of this and the two equally mysterious ‘Actingalone’ particles described above.(171) yam-/e/-ke/          bé

15.4. Grammaticalized social connectednessQuite a number of grammaticalized forms in Hup arguably have a primary—or at least avery frequently exploited—function of indicating social relationships among participants.","[873, 874, 875]"
"       Predicate adjectives typically appear in ‘bare’ form, lacking the Boundary Suffixthat is obligatory for members of the verb class, as in examples (3-4). In this respect,they are in fact not unlike predicate nominals (see §17.3.3.1), which likewise appearwithout inflection, and do not usually require a copula.

In mostcases, the use of verbal aspectual inflection with an adjective indicates a dynamic state,relating to change or impermanence (see also §12.2):

       2sg.POSS hair       long-NEG
       ‘Your hair is not long’ (EL)       Moreover, adjectives can appear in verb compounds, as if they were just anotherverb stem:
(9)    nˆ‡         mç‡y      /ãh hQp-naw-yˆ¤/-ay-áh
       1sg.POSS house 1sg            sweep-good-TEL-INCH-DECL
       ‘I swept my house well’ (H.txt.56)       Finally, predicate adjectives can co-occur in bare form, as in (10); when they co-occur as modifiers, on the other hand, they require the bound form tˆh= (see §6.6).
(10)   toho náw hˆdnˆ‡h              hoho‡d-óh
       white good        3sg.POSS clearing-DECL
       ‘It’s beautiful and white, their clearing.’ (because it is sand) (B.Cv2.131)

       A final property of adjectives that distinguishes them from both nouns andverbs is their association with the Intensifier morpheme muhún / mún (dialectal variants;§15.1.2). This intensifier virtually never associates with nouns, and occurs with verbsonly when these are negated by the clausal negator -nˆ¤h; however, it is very common withadjectives in affirmative (as well as negative) utterances:
(11)   tití/ muhún yúw-úh !

       ‘It’s really dirty!’ (OS)(12)   cãpê    yi‡/-a‡n=b’ay   /am háy’-tQ‡n,        yúp      tˆh=páy muhún cáp-áh!

       ‘If you mess around with another man, that’s really really bad!’ (H.txt.60)The Elative morpheme -k´d also occurs with verbs and adjectives, but in the latter case,[adjective + Elative k´d] form a compound adjectival unit, lacking a Boundary Suffix(see §10.2.2.2.A below). Elative -k´d is always followed by a Boundary Suffix when itassociates with verbs (i.e. it appears as part of the verbal compound).","[562, 563, 564]"

Responding to interrogativesContent questions are typically answered with a standard declarative clause, or moreminimally, a single word that provides the particular information solicited. In the case ofyes-no questions, the typical response is the repetition of the verb phrase that appeared inthe interrogative (whether negative or affirmative), in declarative form. Subjects arefrequently dropped. Examples (156-60) illustrate question-answer dyads between twospeakers (A and B).","[969, 970, 971]"
"        The negative particle nQ¤ (and the Tukano and Tariana variants of this form)bears a rather striking resemblance to the Portuguese negative nem, which typicallyexpresses a ‘neither/nor’ relationship, as can Hup nQ¤ . However, it is not clear whether
                                                                                             889
any actual historical link exists between these forms. Aikhenvald (2002: 135)considers the resemblance “almost certainly coincidental”, noting that “a negative markerwith a dental nasal is attested in many languages of the area, of different geneticaffiliations”. Clarification of the origin of this particle awaits future research.","[905, 906]"
"        A final observation regarding the ‘avertive’ function of -tQ)/- involves itsbehavior in negative contexts, which follows the same rules as itsconditional/counterfactual realization (§14.2.1 above). Because -tQ)/- cannot co-occurwith the verbal Negative suffix -nˆ¤h, an averted negative event can only be expressedwith Frustrative yQ)êh:
(31)    /ãh wˆdham-nˆ¤h yQ‚êh;         g’ˆm-tQ‚ê/-Q‚êy         yQ‚êh
        1sg   arrive.go-NEG    FRUST   capsize-CNTRFCT-DYNM    FRUST
        ‘I almost didn’t arrive; I almost capsized/ drowned.’ (EL)As noted in §16.4, -tQ)/- can occur with the reinforcing negative particle nQ¤, whichotherwise is restricted to contexts in which an explicitly negative morpheme is present(example 32). This is additional evidence that Counterfactual -tQ)/- (at least in its‘avertive’ function) is itself inherently negative (see §14.2.1 above), which makes sensegiven its irrealis function.
(32)    nihu‚ê/   nQ      núp j’áh có/       ni-tQ‚/-ní-h !

        ‘All of these (evil beings) were almost/would have been in our land!’ (H.33)        A few frozen lexical expressions involving tQ‚/- as a root form suggest that theCounterfactual marker may have grammaticalized from what was historically a verb root.",[764]
"       In direct combination with verb roots, -ay typically indicates that an event is aboutto take place:
(26)   b’e‡h-ay
       cross.stream-INCH
       ‘(I’m) going across the stream.’ (i.e. home to the other end of the village) (OS)

(27)   hám-ay
       go-INCH
       ‘(We’re) going.’ (said on the point of leaving; equivalent to ‘goodbye’) (OS)It can also indicate that the event has just begun to take place:
(28)   de‡h      d’o‡j-ay

       ‘It’s beginning to rain.’ (OR: ‘It is about to rain.’) (OS)(29)   n’i-có/      tˆh      ní-ay

       ‘(When) he wants to eat a person (i.e. upon entering a state of wanting), he begins
       screaming (to attract them).’ (C.1)       The Inchoative is common in imperative mood (see §17.4), especially for slightlyimpatient imperatives. In these constructions, both -ay and the preceding stem (or InnerSuffix) take the stress and high tone of the imperative mood:
(32)   húptok g’ç¤p-áy!
       caxiri     serve-INCH.IMP
       ‘Start serving caxiri!’ (i.e. it’s ready, go ahead)(33)   /ç‚h-yˆ¤/-áy!
       sleep-TEL-INCH.IMP
       ‘Go to sleep!’       In negative clauses, Inchoative -ay is typically used to indicate a negative futureevent (as in example 34), and is among the only grammatical means for doing so, sincethe Future suffix -teg / -te- is ungrammatical in negative clauses (see §13.1).
                                                                                            651
Presumably, the idea of entering into or initiating a negative state is semantically akinto the expectation that the negative state will exist at some time in the future. However,use of -ay in a negative construction is not restricted to future reference, and may also beused to describe a current transition into such a state, as in (35).(34)    /ãh ham-nˆ¤h-ay
        1sg      go-NEG-INCH
        ‘I’m not going to go.’ (OS)(35)    pe/-nˆ¤h-ay
        sick-NEG-INCH
        ‘(I’m) not sick anymore.’ (OS)        The Inchoative marker co-occurs with (and typically follows) many other aspectmarkers. It is particularly common following the Telic marker (an Inner Suffix thatindicates complete involvement of the participants, see §12.6). In (36), the sameutterance with Dynamic -Vêy in place of the Inchoative would be translated as ‘are you(fully) used to’, whereas the Inchoative lends the sense of a transition; similarly, theInchoative in example (37) indicates the transition to a state of being cool (whereas theDynamic would mean that it was completely cool and may have been so for some time).
(36)    húp=d’´h máh         ni-hipãh-yˆ¤/-ay     /ám?

        coffee   cool-TEL-INCH
        ‘The coffee is cooling off; is just cool enough to drink.’ (OS)        When the Inchoative is itself followed by a Boundary Suffix, this is mostfrequently Declarative -Vêh—although this is of course restricted to clause-finalenvironments (in keeping with the rules governing -Vêh, see §17.3.2). However, the
                                                                                           652
Inchoative and the Boundary Suffix -Vêy (Dynamic) do not co-occur.144 This fact mayhave a semantic explanation: the Inchoative itself encodes an element of dynamicity (vis-à-vis the temporal reference point) that is otherwise conveyed by Dynamic -Vêy; the final -y of the Inchoative may even be a formal reflection of this. Thus while the Declarative ispreferred on clause-final -ay when the event is not concurrent with the speech moment,-ay occurs by itself when the event is on-going (as in the examples above).","[666, 667, 668, 669]"
"        The basic meaning of ni- is ‘be, exist’, and it occurs as a normal intransitive verbin statements of location and existence. This use is extremely common, and is illustrated

        ‘There are also River Indians (there).’ (B.Cv.133)        As a copula, the primary function of ni- is to host verbal inflection in predicatenominal and adjective clauses. Its use is subject to several restrictions; as mentioned in§17.3.3.2 above, the copula appears with nominal predicates only, and therefore predicateadjectives must be nominalized if they are to occur with a copula. Also, copular ni- doesnot occur when no verbal inflectional markers (other than the Dynamic Boundary Suffix)are present for it to host; if it does occur in the clause under these circumstances, ni- canonly be interpreted in its verbal ‘be, exist’ sense:(85)    /ãêh=tQ)êh tˆh=po‡g ní-íy
        1sg=son      3sg=big       be-DYNM
        ‘My big son exists/ is present.’ (EL)            The use of a copula construction is optional with some inflectional forms—primarily the Perfective, Inchoative, and Counterfactual markers—since these inflectionsmay attach directly to the predicate nominal or adjective. However, the copula ni- is theonly option for expressing other, strictly verbal inflectional forms with predicatenominals and adjectives—particularly the Sequential, Future, and Habitual inflections.","[951, 952]"
"       Intonation in polar questions tends to be relatively high throughout the clause(compared to declarative and other Hup clause types); it is fairly level, but falls slightly atthe end of the clause (as does intonation on constituent questions). The fact that Huppolar questions in general have a relatively higher intonation than declarative clauses is atypologically common pattern; even the placement of the higher intonation at thebeginning of the clause rather than at the end is typologically not unusual (cf. Siemund2001: 1013).
                                                                                         946

       ‘Is it just like food for you all?!’ (B.Cv.90)Because predicate-focused polar interrogatives require a pronominal subject, the subjectreferent can only be referred to by non-pronominal means externally to the interrogativeclause (i.e. in cases where it is not already clear from the discourse):
(125) mangá         tá/-ay,          hˆ¤d-a‡n      yamhidç/-nˆ¤h    tˆ¤h ?

       ‘Will/would you really go?!’ (B.Cv.81)       Polar interrogatives involving predicate nominals are typically identity questions,and are most commonly formed with the ‘intangible’ demonstrative yúp (often yúp=b’ayin Barriera; yú in Tat Deh):

       deer=TEL      that.ITG
       ‘Is that a deer?’ (EL)       Perhaps the most frequent use of polar questions is the standard Hup greeting,which involves asking a question about whatever the addressee is obviously engaged in atthe time. These questions are clearly not really requests for information—the formulavirtually requires the answer to be obvious—but are a conventionalized speech act for thepurpose of social interaction. The standard answer is an affirmative repetition of the verbphrase (see §17.4.5 below). One of the most conventionalized of these questions is thestandard morning greeting (example 132). Other common greetings are provided in(136-38); (133) is often said when entering a house where a number of people are

       ‘Are you scraping (manioc)?’ (OS)       The word order inversion strategy used in these predicate-focused polar questionsis undoubtedly the most typologically striking feature of Hup. Such use of word orderinversion in polar questions is common in European languages, but it is relativelyuncommon elsewhere in the world. Moreover, the fact that it is the only interrogativesubtype in Hup to use a word order inversion strategy violates—at least marginally—
                                                                                                            949
Greenberg’s (1966) universal 11, which states that inversion with polar interrogativesonly occurs in those languages which use inversion to mark constituent interrogatives.193However, inversion in polar questions is restricted in Hup; it involves only pronominalsubjects, and does not occur in constituent-focused polar questions (see §17.4.3 below).","[962, 963, 964, 965, 966]"
"       The unreduced Habitual marker bˆ¤g is identified as a particle, since it follows theverbal core when Dynamic -Vêy is present (as well as a few other forms, such as the

Negative suffix -nˆh), and takes independent stress (high/falling tone). It occurs inindicative, negative, and interrogative clauses alike to express a habitual activity:

        ‘Doesn’t it (hammock) always make you cold?’ (OS)Like most particles in Hup, bˆ¤g appears as an Inner Suffix—drawn into the verb core—when the verb is marked by vowel-initial Boundary Suffixes other than the Dynamic(most commonly Declarative -Vêh), as in the following examples.150 Note also thatHabitual bˆg can follow the interrogative pronominal form ‘what’ (example 138)—as canother verbal formatives such as the Frustrative—although it is otherwise limited primarilyto verbs.

   The fact that particles like bˆg (themselves morphosyntactically bound formatives) are so frequently
phonologically bound to the verb calls into question the characterization of Hup given in Payne (1990: 220)
(based on work by Moore and Franklin 1980). Payne presents Hup as an isolating language that expresses
aspect, mood, etc. by means of independent words, and she illustrates this claim with examples of the
Habitual marker bˆg as an independent form. Note, however, that its true use as an independent lexeme is
functionally and semantically distinct from its use as a Habitual marker (see below).

Semantically, the two variantsare essentially interchangeable (compare example 143), although bˆ¤g is sometimespreferred in more forceful, emphatic utterances.

                (Int.txt.114)        In keeping with its restriction to a time frame concurrent with the speech moment,the distribution of Habitual bˆg / -bˆ- is limited. In particular, it is generally not foundwith past tense statements that have a defined endpoint, and is therefore ungrammatical incombination with the Perfective aspect marker -/e/ / -/e-. To express a habitual eventthat once held true but no longer does, the Perfective alone may be used:
(144) nç-/e‡-h
        say-PERF-DECL
        ‘(I) used to say (it, in my childhood).’ (Int.txt)The Distributive marker pˆ¤d may also express habitual aspect in combination with thePerfective (see §12.9.1 below).","[699, 700, 701, 702]"
"       Use of a copula construction with ni- to carry tense-aspect marking is a generaloption in clauses with pãÙ, as in (47), and is in some cases required, as in (48) (as is alsothe case with verbal -nˆ¤h, cf. example 29 above).

       ‘Having been without a younger sister, without an older sister.’ (Dab.78)       Also unlike normal verbs, the predicative particle pãÙ cannot directly take theFuture suffixes -teg / -te-, which are similarly ungrammatical with Verbal Negative -nˆ¤h
                                                                                           892
(see §16.1.5 above). As in the case of verbs taking the -nˆ¤h negative suffix,predicative pãÙ takes the Future Contrast particle tán instead, as in example (49).

       ‘There won’t be a house (for me to stay in).’ (EL)       However, a type of negative future (or purpose) can also be conveyed through aspecial type of clause, in which a verb stem plus -teg acts as a pseudo-nominal subject,and pãÙ forms the predicate; schematically, ‘future-Verbing does not exist’ (example 50-51). The Future form -teg in this construction appears to have both a nominal and averbal identity, which probably reflects the historical derivation of the verbal futuresuffix from a generic nominalizer (see Historical Note §13.1).

Acknowledgements
This project would never have been possible without the help and support of so many
people along the way. First of all, I am very grateful to the Hupd’´h, who welcomed me
into their villages. I particularly want to thank my primary consultants, Pedro Pires Dias
(Ya/am D’úb), Teresa Monteiro Socot (Mu‡n), and Jovino Monteiro (Hu‡d), as well as
Americo Monteiro (M’Qh J’ˆ‡h), Sabino Monteiro (/Q‡d), and Jarbas Dias (J’ib Hˆ‡/).
Thanks also to all the other people who told stories or sang songs for the tape recorder, or
simply put up with its presence in the midst of their conversations. I also especially want
to thank my adopted ‘family’ in Barreira, Mario, Selina, José Luis, Ped, Aracy, Emilia,
José Maria, and Luisa, for their warm friendship and many meals together; likewise
Paulina, Jovita, and others in Tat Deh, and the many children, young people, and others
who were my companions for over a year.
        Also in Brazil, I owe enormous thanks to Dr. Denny Moore, who first suggested I
work with the Hupd’´h, and who did considerable legwork to help make that possible. I
am also very grateful to Dr. Nilson Gabas Jr., who has acted as my sponsor in Brazil, and
to Jorge Pozzobon and others at the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Belém.
        I am very grateful to the Instituto Socioambiental, particularly to Beto Ricardo,
Marta Azevedo, and others of the Rio Negro team—Carlão, Fernando, Francimar, and
Flora and Aloisio Cabalzar. ISA helped me with the practical issues of fieldwork in a
thousand ways, such as transportation to and from the Indigenous Area, a place to stay in
São Gabriel, advice, and friendship. Without their help, fieldwork would have been next
to impossible.
        I would also like to thank FOIRN (Federação das Organizações Indígenas do Rio
Negro) for their support and interest in the project, and CNPq (Conselho Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnológico) and FUNAI (Fundação Nacional do Indio)
for their permission to undertake research in Brazil and within the Indigenous Area. I am
grateful to the health agents (of Saude Sem Limites, etc.) working in the region for their
support, and particularly to Marc de Bont and Herma Klandermans for their friendship
and help during my months in the field. Thanks also to Renato Athias and Henri Ramirez
for interesting discussions regarding the Hupd’´h and their language.
        I am very grateful to the organizations that funded this research: Fulbright-Hays,
the National Science Foundation (Grant 0111550), and the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Anthropology.
        I did the bulk of the writing of this grammar at the Max Planck Institute in
Leipzig, Germany, and I owe the department there a great deal of thanks for their support
and for the strong intellectual climate that helped to foster this project. I would like to
thank Helma van den Berg, Juliette Blevins, Lea Brown, Claudia Büchel, Julia
Cissewski, Bernard Comrie, Michael Cysouw, Jeff Good, Tom Güldemann, Elena
Lieven, Martin Haspelmath, Susanne Michaelis, Don Stilo, and many others for their
insights and comments on various aspects of this work, as well as for their friendship in
Leipzig. I am also grateful to Nick Enfield and others at the MPI for Psycholinguistics in
Nijmegen, who generously supplied me with the extremely useful (and fun) elicitation
materials that they have developed for use in the field, and with whom I had many
                                                                                        xiv
stimulating discussions. In addition, I would like to thank a number of other linguists
for their input on aspects of Hup grammar or its typological implications, particularly
Alexandra Aikhenvald, Mark Donahue, Nick Evans, Larry Hyman, Claire LeFebvre, and
others.
        In particular, I would like to thank Orin Gensler, who read and made copious
insightful comments on every page of this manuscript. I can never thank him enough for
the amount of time and care he put into being my mentor at MPI, or for his unfailing
encouragement and support during the writing process. With his vast knowledge of
typology and historical linguistics, his meticulous approach, and his enormous patience,
Orin would be anyone’s ideal mentor.
         At the University of Virginia, I owe enormous thanks to my advisor Eve
Danziger, who has been behind this project from the very beginning, and who has been
an invaluable part of every step in the process. Without her insightful comments, her
encouragement, and her constant support, it is hard to imagine how this project would
have been possible.
        I am also grateful to the other members of my committee, Lise Dobrin, Ellen
Contini-Morava, George Mentore, and Peter Hook, for all their helpful comments at
various stages of the project. Thanks as well to the others in the Department of
Anthropology at UVA, especially for their willingness to let me take this project where I
wanted it to go.
        Finally, a special thanks to my husband Chris for all his support and his patience
with my long absences.

1. Hup and its speakers        The approximately 1500 speakers1 of the Hup language (also known as Hupda)live scattered throughout the heavily forested region on the Brazil-Colombia frontier. Onthe Brazilian side, the region is known as the Cabeça de Cachorro or ‘Dog’s Head’ (dueto its shape on the map), and is part of the state of Amazonas. Within this region, mostHup speakers live in an area of approximately 5400 square kilometers, defined by theTiquié River to the south, the Vaupés River to the east, and the Papuri River to the north,as shown in Map 1.1.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"       The dropping of arguments is common in Hup when they can be recovered fromthe discourse context; this is particularly true for objects (example 1). Subject droppingalso occurs (example 2), but is less frequent. In general, Hup speakers seem to preferclauses with only one full nominal (i.e. non-pronominal) argument, and will sometimeseven repeat the clause, dropping an argument each time, in order to conform to this(example 3). In providing information in response to a question or related solicitationfrom an interlocutor, an utterance may consist of only a verb (plus inflection), or only anoun or adjective, but in most other discourse contexts a predicate with at least onenominal argument (usually the subject) is the norm.

This order is oftenfavored when the clause encodes an ongoing or currently relevant event, and particularlywhen the subject is a pronoun; these clauses are therefore common in everydayconversation, but quite infrequent in narrative and other types of discourse. In suchcases, the verb is usually marked with the Dynamic suffix -Vêy, but other BoundarySuffixes are possible (e.g. Inchoative -ay, Negative -nˆ¤h, etc.).","[922, 923]"

                  ‘(I’m) going to write.’       The semi-nominal identity of Future -teg / -te- in Hup may also explain itsungrammaticality in negative clauses. Since Hup uses a different strategy for negatingnominal entities than for negating verbal clauses (see chapter 16), it is in fact predictable
                                                                                                       722
that an intermediate form like teg would pattern irregularly in negated contexts. Thisis supported by the fact that it is not only the verbal form of teg that is irregular whennegated, but the nominal form as well. On the one hand, a possessed nominalization with=teg undergoes normal existential negation just like any other noun:
(26)    [[nˆ‡             pQ‡m=teg]           pãÙ]
          1sg.POSS        sit=thing           NEG:EX
        ‘My seat (log for sitting) is not here/ does not exist.’ (EL)(27)    [[nˆ‡            hç‚Ùp]   pãÙ]
        1sg.POSS         fish     NEG:EX
        ‘My fish is not here/ does not exist.’ (EL)However, while most nouns can also appear with existential negation in predicatenominal clauses with no overt copula, as in (28), nominal constructions with =teg areungrammatical when they appear with a nominative pronoun in the same type ofconstruction, as illustrated in (29); compare (29) to (26) above, where the only surfacedifference is the form of the pronoun.
(28)    /ãêh [[hç‚Ùp] pãÙ]
        1sg       fish          NEG:EX
        ‘I am without fish.’ (EL)(29)    */ãêh [[pQ‡m=teg]             paÙ‚]
          1sg    sit=thing            NEG:EX
          ‘I am without a sitting-thing.’ (EL)Instead, the only grammatical form of this expression requires a verbal stress pattern, incombination with a constituent negator, as in example (30). A verbal clause has beenproduced from a copula-less predicate nominal clause—but it is a peculiar verbal clause,

  Note, however, that the Perfective aspect and other markers can also attach directly to the question word
‘what’, so this form with teg is not completely irregular vis-à-vis other verbal suffixes in Hup.
                                                                                         723
since the Existence Negator pãÙ is usually ungrammatical with verbs. Moreover, theinterpretation of (30) is as ambiguous between noun and verb as is its form, since ‘I havenothing to sit on’ is pragmatically equivalent to ‘I will sit on nothing’.

       1sg    sit-thing/FUT?   NEG:EX
       ‘I have nothing to sit on.’ (EL)       The historical scenario discussed here is also supported by comparative evidence,since cognates for the lexeme ‘wood, stick’ can be identified in at least two otherNadahup languages (Yuhup tég and Nadeb t´´g; cf. Ospina 2002 and Weir 1984), but nosimilar future marker appears to exist. Moreover, a bound form -teg exists in Yuhup aspurpose marker (Ospina, p.c.). Finally, a likely motivating force for the development ofthe future gram in Hup comes from Tukano, which not only has an explicit future tense,but has been shown to have motivated the development of future marking in theneighboring Arawak language Tariana (Aikhenvald 2002).","[738, 739, 740]"
"9.2. Defining the verb compound as ‘word’The main criterion for defining a verb compound in Hup is the fact that it forms onephonological word, determined by stress patterns and pause phenomena. Primary stressoccurs only on the last verb stem and/or the following suffix material (depending on thetype of Boundary Suffix; see §3.4), whereas non-final stems do not receive word-levelstress, and component stems are also not separated by pauses. Phonological word-hoodis frequently cited as a defining feature of a compound, and has been used to distinguishcompounding from serialization within a single language, such as Paamese (see Durie1997: 304, with reference to Crowley 1982), and Tariana (Aikhenvald 2003). The othercrucial defining feature of Hup compounds is that no other morphological material cancome between the component stems, with the exception of the valency-changing pre-forms hi- (Factitive) and hup- (Reflexive).
                                                                                          484
       Negation phenomena provide an illustration of this ungrammaticality of non-stem-related morphological material between component stems of a compound. Clausalnegation can take scope over the entire compound; as such, the negative suffix -nˆh iscompound-final, as in /´g-pQm-nˆ¤h (drink-sit-NEG) ‘not sitting drinking’, the negativeform of the compound /´g-pQ¤m-Q¤y (drink-sit-DYNM) ‘sitting and drinking’. When onlyone verbal constituent of a compound is negated, however, this typically produces twoseparate predicates. Thus ‘sitting and not drinking’ must be expressed via twocoordinated predicates: /´g-nˆ¤h pQ¤m-Q¤y (drink-NEG sit-DYNM). Each of these forms adistinct phonological and grammatical word: they receive independent stress, and whilethe subject (e.g. 3pl hˆ¤d) cannot be inserted between elements of the compound (*/´ghˆd pQ¤m-Q¤y), it can come between the coordinated predicates in the negativeconstruction (/´g-nˆ¤h hˆd pQ¤m-Q¤y). Further examples are provided in (2-3).

       Other defining criteria for the Hup verb compound include the fact that it takes asingle grammatical subject, and its stems share a single compound-final Boundary Suffix,as well as other formatives. Semantically, the verb compound refers to an event that hasconceptual unity (although the degree of this ‘unity’ is relative to the degree of stem
                                                                                           485
integration). Like compounds cross-linguistically, Hup verbal constructions maybecome lexicalized and undergo corresponding phonological and semantic changes (seePayne 1997: 233). For example, the compound b’uy-d’eh- (throw-send) ‘throw out’(itself nested within the larger compound in example (1) above) is frequently pronounced[mb’uyc‡’´h], in which the palatalization from the /y/ is carried over to change the /d’/ to apalatal stop (realized phonetically as a fricative).","[500, 501, 502]"
"A. Boundary SuffixesBoundary Suffixes are defined as the group of suffixes that separate the core of the verb(in which prefixes, roots, and Inner Suffixes can co-occur to form a phonological unit)from the periphery, which is made up of unstressed enclitics and (phonologicallyrelatively free) particles. Most Boundary Suffixes are considered to be primarily verbalforms by definition, but the same formative can in many cases occur with both verbs andnouns (and in some cases with other parts of speech).
                                                                                             173
       As discussed in §8.3, verbs (in most moods) minimally require one, and onlyone, Boundary Suffix (arguably including certain -Ø marked forms) when acting aspredicates, but may have anywhere from zero to multiple Inner Suffixes (preceding theBoundary Suffix) and peripheral formatives (following the Boundary Suffix). As a classof verbal formative, the Boundary Suffixes do in general have a functional commondenominator: one appears on every verbal predicate to mark the clause type, in somecases almost like a marker of punctuation. Thus a subset of Boundary Suffixes indicatesvarious types of main clause (declarative, interrogative, negative, etc.), as well asindicating finer distinctions such as strong vs. neutral imperative, optative, andapprehensive (all of which could be considered sub-types of imperative), etc. Another setof Boundary Suffixes indicates the various types of dependent or subordinate clause,including complements, relative clauses, and various adverbial clauses. While groupedaccordingly in the discussion below, these suffixes are treated elsewhere in the grammaralongside other formatives to which they relate functionally and semantically, rather thanformally (as noted above). A few forms can appear as either Boundary or Inner Suffixes(see B below); these are Future/Purpose -tég, Inchoative -ay, and Negative -nˆ¤h.","[189, 190]"
"Instead of functioning primarily as an enclitic, Inferred -ni- occurs only as a verbal InnerSuffix, combining directly and exclusively with verb stems. Its morphosyntacticdistribution is highly restricted in comparison with that of the enclitics: it must occur on aclause-final predicate—even in an interrogative clause (making it ungrammatical in polarinterrogatives using a word order inversion strategy, see §17.4.2). It does not occur at allin negative clauses, cannot appear together with other evidentials in the same verb word,and is used exclusively in reference to a past event.",[814]
"       Of the Boundary Suffixes, a subset of forms—which share a vowel-copyingprofile (plus an unmarked ‘zero’ form)—can be defined functionally as maximally‘basic’ in that they mark several of the most distinctive clause types and are otherwiselargely semantically neutral (Table 17.1; see also §3.4.1.2). Although these morphemesare heterogeneous in their patterning inside the clause (and may in some cases co-occurwithin the clause), when they occur on a clause-final verbal predicate they are mutually
                                                                                                           903
exclusive186 and correspond consistently to clause type. These are by far the mostfrequently occurring Boundary Suffixes in Hup, although they are often supplanted byvarious other Boundary Suffixes (e.g. the Verbal Negative -nˆ¤h (§16.1), the forcefulImperative -kQ‡m (§17.5.2), etc.). Where they relate to declarative, interrogative, andimperative clauses, the functions and patterning of the various Boundary Suffixes(including these maximally ‘basic’ forms) will be discussed in this chapter. The clause-marking functions of other Boundary Suffixes are treated in chapter 18 and other sectionsof this grammar.","[919, 920]"
"Note, however, that the ‘stem’ may itself be made up of a string of stems forming a
                                                                                              472
compound, as discussed in detail in chapter 9. A basic template for the verb word isthe following (note that generally obligatory elements appear in boldface):(Proclitic) = Prefix(es) - Stem - Inner Suffix(es) - Boundary Suffix = Enclitic(s) Particle(s)       In reality, this template is not quite as neat as it appears. First, the distinctionbetween component verb stems (in compounds) and Inner Suffixes is somewhat blurry inHup. This synchronic fuzziness has a diachronic explanation: Inner Suffixes typicallygrammaticalize from verbs within compounds, and some forms are currently in atransitional phase (see §9.4.3). Second, most enclitics and particles can appear in theInner Suffix slot when followed by clause-final Boundary Suffixes (most commonly theDeclarative marker -Vêh) as discussed in §3.5. A few suffixes (Inchoative -ay, Negative-nˆ¤h, and Future -tég) can optionally appear as either Boundary Suffixes or InnerSuffixes. Finally, two of Hup’s three prefixes—Reflexive hup- and Reciprocal /u)h—canoptionally disassociate from the verb when occurring in a ditransitive construction withan explicit object; in this context, these precede the object nominal and are bestconsidered particles (see §11.1 and §11.2).","[488, 489]"
"        The particle keyó/ itself marks an adverbial clause (formed from the inflectedverb + keyó/), which relates to the reason behind an event. This unit is dependent on amain clause, which expresses the event itself, as in examples (195-97). It also occurs inthe interrogative expression hˆ¤nˆ¤ykeyó/ (hˆ‚-nˆ¤h-ˆ¤y key-yó/ [Q-be.like-DYNM see-SEQ])‘why, for what reason?’.

       ‘Because he saw the children, he became angry.’ (EL)This ‘Reason’ adverbial use of key- ‘see’ is largely limited to the Sequential form of theverb, but not completely; for example, an annoyed person said (200)—using thesubordinated form of ‘see’ in a ‘reason’ sense—to an intruding dog:
(200) hˆ‚-n’ˆ‡h    kéy-ep /am       yé-e/ ?!
       Q-NMZ       see-DEP 2sg      enter-INT
       ‘What did you come in for?!’ (lit. ‘What did you come in to see?’) (OS)18.2.6.7. Temporal/spatial adverbial particle téHup has only one adverbial particle that precedes the clause, while the rest all follow itand usually appear as verbal suffixes. This is the temporal/ spatial adverbial té, ‘until, upto’, which marks a point that is reached when describing movement through space ortime. A free particle, té typically precedes either a place name or a dependent clause:
                                                                                       1046(201) k´d-yˆ/ ní-íy,        /ˆn k´d-k´dham-yˆ/-bˆ¤-ay-áh,      té    nút wQdhç ní-n’ˆ‡h
       pass-TEL be-DYNM 1pl pass-pass.go-TEL-HAB-INCH-DECL until here sun           be-NMZ
       ‘We passed beyond it, (as) we always pass it, until the sun was here.’ (S.PN.15)In narrative, Hup speakers frequently pronounce té with special emphasis, usuallyinvolving higher intensity and pitch, a dramatic pause following the word, and often anemphatic final glottal stop:
(202) yˆ¤t    hi-g’et-yó/      hˆd   ham-ní-ip=b’ay,   té/ !         bedné!
       thus   FACT-stand-SEQ 3pl     go-be-DEP=AGAIN until(EMPH) Belem
       ‘So having stayed there, they went on again, until! (they got to) Belém!’
       (H.txt.30)       The particle té is almost certainly a borrowing from Portuguese até ‘until’, andprobably entered Hup via Tukano. One consultant who is reasonably fluent inPortuguese sometimes uses Portuguese até interchangeably with té. The same form tealso occurs in Tariana (cf. Aikhenvald 2003) and Tukano (Ramirez 1997b: 187).

1) Martins and Martins (1999): Propose that Kakua-Nukak share 35% cognate with Hup-Yuhup, but say that “the lexical
data are scanty… and these figures are provisional” (1999: 254); 35% may be no more than a complete guess. (Data source for
K-N not given; may be Koch-Grunberg 1906b.)

2) Koch-Grünberg (1906b: 882): Proposes a short list of correspondences between Kakua and Yuhup to claim that they
are related.","[1061, 1062, 1063, 1064, 1065, 1066, 1067, 1068, 1069, 1070, 1071, 1072]"
"        The forms -teg / -te- are in fact markers of relative future, in that they are used torelate a given event to a reference point, regardless of whether that reference point isconcurrent with the speech act itself, or occurs at some other time. The suffix -teg hasthe additional function of expressing purpose semantics, which intersects closely with itsfunction as an indicator of relative future. Comrie (1976: 2) notes that future is as much amode as a tense in many languages, and this purposive function of the Hup future tensemarker illustrates that this is indeed the case for Hup.
                                                                                                   712
        The phonologically unreduced form -teg is unusual in that it appears as aBoundary Suffix in certain environments, and as an Inner Suffix in others. As aBoundary Suffix, it is usually not found in clause-final position in declarative clauses (butsee exceptions below). It may be followed in the clause by a nominal argument, as inexample (1), or by consonant-initial verbal formatives, like the ‘Repeated instance’enclitic in (2) or the discourse tag in (3).

        ‘Who will go?’ (OS)        The reduced variant -te-, like all other phonologically reduced suffix variants inHup (see §3.6), occurs only as an Inner Suffix followed by a vowel-initial Boundary
                                                                                            713
Suffix. It is most common in clause-final position, followed by Declarative -Vêh, as inexamples (2-3) above. It also occurs in combination with the Dependent marker -Vp(example 5), the Oblique case marker -Vêt (example 8 below) and Inchoative -ay, amongother vowel-initial Boundary Suffixes. The combined Inchoative and Declarative form-ay-áh (see §12.3) is of very common occurrence with -te-, and contributes an additionalprospective or initiated sense to the future statement, much like that conveyed by English‘going to’ as opposed to ‘will’, as in examples (6-7). Note that the semantic andpragmatic difference between the simple future form -té-h and the progressive future -té-ay-áh is minimal; for example, the same speaker who uttered the sentence in (3) aboverepeated her statement almost word-for-word immediately afterward, but substituted theprogressive form for the simple future that she had used in the first instance (example 7).

       (B.Cv1.80)       As with other such pairs of reduced and non-reduced formative variants in Hup,the reduced form -te- is strictly limited to environments preceding a vowel-initialBoundary Suffix, whereas -teg is much more flexible.

suffix, particularly in emphatic contexts such as (8) (girls joking about acquiring longhair) and in (9), which would be uttered when one is trying to go to sleep and is tellingnoisy people to be quiet (in contrast, the reduced future form -té-ay-áh would simply bean announcement of intention to sleep).

       ‘I’m going to sleep!’ (forceful; e.g. ‘so stop making noise!’) (RU)
In exclamatory or emphatic utterances, non-reduced -teg even occurs without theDeclarative marker (i.e. as a Boundary Suffix) clause-finally in non-interrogative mood, acontext in which -te-h (Future + Declarative) would ordinarily be expected:
(10)   hˆd      nçg’od      j’á        pQm-hi-ham-tég!
       2pl      mouth       black      sit-descend-go-FUT
       ‘They’re going to be sitting around with black mouths!’ (from eating coca)

       Thelma      throw-send-go-TEL-FUT
       ‘Thelma’s going to throw it out!’ (B.Cv.136)       The Future marker -teg / -te- is idiosyncrasic in that it is ungrammatical inimperative and in negative clauses. Future tense can only be specified in the imperativeby means of the Future Contrast particle tán (see §13.4 below); a negative futureconstruction can also be with formed with tán, or expressed as Inchoative aspect (see
                                                                                           715
§12.3). The ungrammaticality of the Future suffix in negative clauses is anirregularity that has no clear precedent elsewhere in Hup; by analogy with forms such asHabitual bˆg / -bˆ-, one would expect the construction [Vstem-nˆh-teg] to be possible(involving the Clausal negator -nˆh). In fact, small children do make exactly thisanalogy, as illustrated by the following utterance by a three-year-old boy (example 12).","[728, 729, 730, 731, 732]"

        ‘And after that?’ (OS)        While dependent Sequential clauses are almost always followed by a main clauseof some kind, this may be no more than the ‘light’ or ‘dummy’ verb ni- ‘be’. This verbforms a kind of default main clause when no other verb is readily available to the speaker(cf. §18.2.2):
(168) yawa‡ç          tˆh w’ób-óh, to‡k       cç/-d’o/-k´dcçp-yó/            ní-íy   tˆh w’ób-óh

        ‘She placed the monkey (on the jirau), after having gutted it and come up from the
        river she placed it…’ (D-BWB.3)        The dependent Sequential clause is almost always followed by the main clause;however, there are one or two examples in my corpus of the reverse order, as in (169).
                                                                                         1035
While this would seem to be an argument against normal clause-chaining, thisreversal of clause order involving the Sequential is quite rare in Hup, and it is possiblethat the very few examples like (169) could be explained as an afterthought on the part ofthe speaker.
(169) tˆh pé/-éy,       húptok       /´g-yó/
       3sg sick-DYNM person.belly drink-SEQ
       ‘He’s sick, after drinking caxiri.’ (OS)       As noted above, use of the Sequential also usually requires the same subject forboth clauses. However, there seem to be a few exceptions to this rule as well:
(170) na/-hipãh-nˆ¤h       g’ã/-hi-ham-yó/,
       die-know-NEG        be.suspended-FACT-go-SEQ

For example, the Sequential form ‘having wanted what’ is used to mean ‘forwhat reason?’ in (171) (also see the use of causal keyó/ (key-yó/ [see-SEQ]) ininterrogatives; §18.2.6.6 below).

          Example (172) illustrates the incompatibility of the dependent Sequentialclause with verbal negation; negative predicates require copular ni- ‘be’, as a coordinatedpredicate, to host the Sequential.
(172) wˆ/-nˆ¤h        ni-yó/   /ˆn        b’ay-té-ay-áh

          ‘Having understood nothing, we’d return.’ (B.Cv1.82)          Like negative clauses, predicate nominal clauses also require copular ni- to hostthe Sequential, which cannot attach directly to the predicate nominal itself (cf. §17.3.3.1;compare the negative clauses above). However, there is at least one exception to theprimarily verbal identity of Sequential -yó/ : it can follow nominal forms that take theOblique case (as a locative), to mean ‘having gone to/ been at X’:
(173) tát            deh-ét-yó/,         cãw yucá-an tˆh ham-té-h

          ‘Having been at Tat Deh, he’ll go to São José.’ (EL)18.2.6.4. Simultaneity and concession with -mˆ‡/The Boundary Suffix -mˆ‡/, like Sequential -yó/ and other forms discussed in this chapter,attaches to verb stems to form dependent clauses, and may be better considered toinvolve clause-chaining rather than subordination. Where Sequential -yó/ favors thesame subject in the linked clauses, use of Simultaneous -mˆ‡/ reveals a strong preferencefor different subjects; this appears semantically natural, since two simultaneous actionsare normally more likely to be performed by two different people than by the sameperson.
                                                                                                          1037
       As a Boundary Suffix on verbs, the form -mˆ‡/ contributes the adverbial senseof temporal simultaneity (‘at the same time as’) or concession (‘even though, in spite of’).","[1050, 1051, 1052, 1053, 1054]"
"       Like most other formatives relating to clause linking in Hup, Adversative ka‡h is aperipheral formative (a particle), which cannot occur in the verbal Inner Suffix position(unlike many other peripheral formatives). It usually follows the last of two (or more)coordinated predicates. Example (29) illustrates its use in coordinating two clauseswithin the same sentence. In examples (30-31), it occurs on an independent clause that islinked to the preceding discourse. The speaker in (31) had been talking about thechallenge of keeping one’s children fed.

       ‘(For those) with no kids, on the other hand, it’s all right.’ (P-Sp.3)       The Adversative Conjunction in in general optional; clauses in an adversativerelationship can also be expressed by simple juxtaposition, as in (32) (note that ka‡h isacceptable here, although the speaker did not choose to use it):
                                                                                              982

It can also mark a clash between reality andintent or effort—in other words, between the situation expressed by a clause and anotherpossible world of which the listener is expected to be aware:

In particular, in expressions like(34) which require a focus marker (because the clause ends in a subject that takes theDependent marker, producing an emphatic construction), ka‡h can fill this slot.

18.1.5. DisjunctionTo indicate an explicit disjunction, speakers may simply express the options as twocoordinated clauses or phrases, each marked with the Epistemic modality particle /u)hníy‘maybe’ (usually together with the Inferred evidential =cud, see §14.9.3):
(35)    wi‡h     cím’-íy=cud        /u‚hni¤y,      ya/ambo‡/       g’´¤ç-´¤y=cud    /u‚hníy
        hawk     claw-DYNM=INFR maybe              dog             bite-DYNM=INFR    maybe
        ‘Either the hawk clawed (it), or the dog bit (it), apparently.’ (EL)        The borrowed form /ó (from Portuguese ou ‘or’, cf. §18.1.3 above) is in commonuse to indicate disjunction, either instead of or in addition to the strategy in (35) above, asillustrated in example (36). Note that disjunctive /ó typically occurs twice, coming bothbefore and between the expressed options—exactly as Portuguese speakers use ou…ou ineither/or expressions—rather than following only the second option (the more typicalnative pattern). This is also distinct from the less common conjunctive ‘and’ use of /ó(example 28 above), where it occurs only once and in the intermediate position. TheAdversative particle ka‡h can also appear at the end of the sentence as an extra signal ofthe disjunction (with or without /ó). However, this is only a marginal function of ka‡h;not only is ka‡h optional here, but it also is not by itself indicative of a disjunction, asexample (37) illustrates.(36)    /ó /atúdu=cud/u‚hníy, /ó cibínu=cud/u‚hníy, ham-yˆ/-cˆê‚w-ˆ‚êy                        ka‡h

                 (P.F.126)
18.2. Subordination and cosubordinationThe majority of Hup’s clause-linking strategies involve a combination of a main clauseand a dependent clause. The verb in the dependent clause typically takes a BoundarySuffix (see §3.4.1.2) that specifies its relationship to the main clause, but in general thisdependent-clause verb lacks inflection for tense-aspect-mode, illocutionary force, oreven—in some cases—negation. These are usually specified on the verb in the mainclause, which typically takes one of the vowel-initial Boundary Suffixes (§3.4.1.2).","[998, 999, 1000, 1001]"
"Also, negative imperatives are obligatorily phrased as adverbial expressions (usually with=yˆ/); see §16.1.1.",[570]
"         Hup imperatives are limited to second person subjects. Other, related moods aretherefore expressed via different strategies; for example, first person plural hortative-typeconstructions involve the Declarative -Vêh (§13.3 and above; also compare the hortativefunction of the ‘Cooperative’ suffix -nˆ‡N, §14.5). An identical form (-/u)êh) is used bothas the imperative form of the applicative construction and to signal optative mood (whichis limited to third person subjects)—probably indicative of a historical relationshipbetween the applicative and the optative constructions, as argued in §14.7. Finally, thereis also a formal similarity between the simple unmarked imperative and the apprehensivemood (§14.6), both of which are expressed by a bare verb stem and a second personsubject; moreover, these are pragmatically similar speech acts, since an utterance in theapprehensive mood is usually intended as a warning (i.e. a negative command), andsolicits some action (usually one relating to protecting himself) from the addressee.",[974]
"Examples of this imperative form are given in (188-90).

       (T-PN.3)17.5.3. Responses to imperativesResponses to commands are much like the responses to questions, discussed above in§17.4.5. An acquiescent response is usually a simple h´‡/ ‘yes, all right’, as illustrated inthe text example in (193), and may also involve the repetition of the predicate (often infuture form). A negative response may likewise involve the repetition of the predicate, innegated form.(193) “hu‚ê         yQ‚/-/áy!”       tˆ¤h-a‡n   t ˆh    nç¤-ç¤h;

18. Clause combining       Hup has a rich repertoire of strategies for combining clauses. Mechanismsinvolve coordination, subordination, and cosubordination, including what may be bestcharacterized as clause-chaining. This chapter begins with a discussion of coordinationin Hup, then moves on to subordination and cosubordination, where at least one clause isdependent on another. Hup has an especially wide selection of (co)subordinationstrategies for indicating temporal overlap or succession of events.","[981, 982, 983]"
