"      While drills give practice to the learners for mastering the linguistic rules
 by automation, exercises are meant to find out whether the learners have
 imbibed the rules which they practised inductively. So, it is necessary that
 exercises are attempted only after administering drills. Exercises can be work-
 ed out by the learners both orally and in writing. The exercises are of different
 types, testing the learning of various elements of grammatical features from
 sandhi to formation of sentences that make up a conversation. Types of exer-
 cises included in this book can be summarised as below:

                                      XV11     As in the case of drills, exercises also have specific objectives
For example, exercises 1 to 4 test the operation of internal and external sandhi
and formation of compounds and sentence segments. Exercises 5 to 7 relate
to the mastery of selectional restrictions among the parts of a sentence and
different types of derivation and inflection in addition to testing the use of
vocabulary items. -From exercises 8 to 18, the emphasis is on the testing of
the ability to form various sentence patterns, their manipulations, inter-rela-
tionships and interpretations. Exercises 19 to 22 test the mastery of putting
questions and giving answers and providing appropriate responses to given
stimuli. Exercises 23, 24 and 25, test the comprehension and use of vocabulary
items learned. The rest of the exercise types test comprehension in general
and use of linguistic patterns in appropriate situations in particular.
     The vocabulary section includes the words that occur in the conversation
for the first time. They are entered in the order of their occurrence in the
conversation. The meaning of the vocabulary item is given in English and is
most often restricted to the context in which it occurs in the lesson. In the
case of certain verbs that occur in their past tense forms, the verb stems are
also given in brackets while listing the vocaulary items. The index provided
at the end of this book lists, in the alphabetical order, all the words, which
appear in the lessons. There are a total of 1,869 words in this index. They
are also identified for their first occurrence in a unit and a lesson. Tn most
of the cases the majority of the words in a lesson, more or less, belongs to the
same semantic field, thus facilitating ready recall by the learners. The users
of this book may also refer to Recall Vocabulary in Malaya/am—Semantically
Classified (Central Institute of Indian Languages, mimeographed) and Hindi-
Malayalam Common Vocabulary (197'3, Central Institute of Indian Languages),
as additional sources for learning Malayalam vocabulary.
     The Notes give information pertaining to grammatical as well as cultural
features. Grammatical notes are given as explanations from the point of
view- of function. Each of the structural bits newly introduced in the lesson
finds a note on it with illustrative examples. When felt necessary, cross
references are made with respect to the preceding notes in the same lesson
or in the previous lessons. While explaining a grammatical point, use of
technical terms is kept to the minimum.
This Book as a Generalised Course
     Though this book is the prescribed text for the Basic Course phase of
learning Malayalam in the Southern Regional Language Centre, it could be
                                      XV111easily used for any generalised second language programme in Malayalam
both by adult learners and their teachers. The teachers would do well to
expose their students to additional materials, prepared closely in conjunction
with the structures employed in a particular lesson. These materials may
be used for the development of all the four language skills: listening, speaking,
reading and writing.","[15, 16, 17, 18]"

                   verb are introduced in this lesson. Definite imperatives are used
                   for more authoritative commands or requests. The definite
                   imperative and the negative imperative are formed by the addition
                   of the suffixes-sroo and —sne to the —<BTO ending verbal nouns.

             in most cases on a substitutable manner. But on some occasions,
             prohibitives are used to bring more force for the negative command.

        Each drill has a specific objective of achieving a particular linguistic
  activity. Repetition drill enables the learners to listen to model utterances
  of the teacher/native speaker and then repeat the same so that proper practice
  of correct pronunciation, Sandhi and intonation are taken care of. The
  repetition drill also gives the learner a clear picture, at a glance, of the structural
  bits introduced in that lesson. Build up drill provides the learners with
  ample opportunities to practise the normal word order of the sentence and
  helps them memorise the sentence through a' systematic building up of the
  same by a progressive addition of words in the given order.                 Expansion
  drill enables the learners to be familiar with the placement of additional words
  in a given sentence frame and thus form a bigger sentence. Substitution drill
  deals with the selectional restriction among different categories of words in a
  sentence and among different manifestations of a single word and also gives
  practice of vocabulary items. Restatement drill is meant to enable the learners
. to practise the formation and use of different varieties of sentence patterns
  while transformation drill, in addition to the above purpose, also takes care
  of the inter-relationship between sentences. Response drill gives practice to
  put questions and give answers and for making relevant statements in appro-
  priate contexts. While Reinterpretation drill gives practice for the expression
  of the meaning of a given sentence pattern in more than one way, Completion
  drill prepares the learners for the ready mastery of structural elements that
  form meaningful sentences. If a teacher administers the above drills in a
  class room, he can decide on the basis of the situation whether it should be
  chorus, chain or individual. In short, drills enable the learners to train them-
  selves in the use of different types of meaningful utterances that make up the
 language.",[15]
