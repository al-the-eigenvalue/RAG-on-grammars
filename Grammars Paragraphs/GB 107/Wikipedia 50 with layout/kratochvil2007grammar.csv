6.4.2      Affirmative predicate markers
Affirmative predicate markers affirm predicates. That means that they mark them as
‘true’. Their function is inverted negation. There are two affirmative predicate markers
in Abui: ba and bai (discussed in 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.2.2). Both items are identified as verbs,
because they may combine with person and aspectual inflection. Both markers are
related, in fact they are a grammaticalization of the verb ba ‘say’ which is used when
direct speech is quoted, as illustrated in (222) where the verb ba ‘say’ follows a direct
speech and combines with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC).15(222) ‘ah Karfe Hawa moku loku do                     taki!’              he-ba

marker, and an intersective linker in both nominal and verbal domain (see also 3.5.6
and 4.5).16   6.4.2.1     Affirmative predicate marker ba
The affirmative predicate marker ba ‘say’ affirms the true value of a predicate. Its use is
illustrated in (223). The marker ba ‘say’ indicates that the child that is described as
‘shivering’ in the preceding clause perhaps ‘is’ ill. The first clause expresses the topic of
the predicate, which is expressed in the second clause. Structurally, the construction
reminds of the copula clauses given in section 4.5, example (122).(223) [moku nuku oro raharak-d-i-a                          do]clause [yang ha-rik]          ba

      ‘the child over there is shivering, it is perhaps ill’                          [B05.060.04]In (224), the marker ba ‘say’ follows the index verb na ‘be like.PRX’. Also this structure
is related to the copula clauses mentioned above. However, as the complement itself is
verbal, the verb ba ‘say’ has acquired the affirmative function.(224) [ma]topic         [na]complement        bacopula/affirmative marker

both conversation turns. One of the participants inquires whether the solicitors ‘will’
start bargaining. One solicitor answers that they ‘do’ intend to do so.","[302, 303]"

in (220). The particle doma ‘no’ is located in front of the negative clause muila naha
‘not play’.",[302]
"15In this function, ba is translated with the Malay verb bilang ‘say’, which is the motivation of the gloss.
16Cross-linguistically, copulas may acquire the affirmative function and even develop to a nominalising device
with possible extensions as complementizer or relator (cf. LaPolla, 2007:10).

conditional clause: naha ba ‘if not’. The second ba ‘say’ indicates that it is true that
there are evil ghosts, if one does not sleep elsewhere.(226) do-wa                   he-n               taa, naha ba, tafang beka             ba

(227). In these constructions, ba ‘say’ follows the VP in the complement clause of the
utterance verb fanga/fangi ‘say, speak, utter’.(227) a. ne-nahaa               di he-fanga=ti               [ha-rik                  ba]CC

demonstrative yo (MD.AD). For more details about the use of anaphoric demonstratives
in the clause domain see section 6.4.3. In (228), the speaker reports his dream, in which
he went to the harbour Kalabahi. In the dream reality, the speaker refers to himself as
to his ‘spirit’ and stresses the true value of his dream report with the affirmative marker
ba ‘say’.(228) na piei-l-a=ti                    [na-noting Kalang-Fat yaa                   ba]CC

   6.4.2.2    Confirmative predicate marker bai
The marker bai confirms the true value of a predicate. The marker bai consists of the
marker ba ‘say’ that is inflected with the perfective suffix -i (PFV). The marker bai is
used to persuade the addressee of true value of the predication. Consider the fragment
in (229). The speaker is requested to shoot with the bow. He complains about the fact
that his arm ‘does’ already hurt.(229) na-táng        na-rik                 ba-i

proves its verbal character when it combines with the aspectual marker te (INCP.C). The
first occurrence of the confirmative marker ba-i (say-PFV) indicates the true value of the
clause ‘I just told it to you’. The form bai serves as a copula, as it takes the first clause
as its topic, while the copula complement is expressed by the second clause.(230) [na      el        he-o-k                     fangi      do]clause       ba-i,   [a-wei

whenever it is about to be true that Dori can then she goes to the market.","[303, 304, 305]"

6.4.1     Negation
Clausal negation negates the whole proposition expressed in the clause (cf. Payne
1997:282). It marks the value of a predicate as ‘false’ or ‘absent’. Abui clause is negated

with the verb naha ‘not be’ (see 6.4.1.1). Further, there are two particles, mainly
associated with the imperative construction: the prohibitive markers he (PRH) and doma
(PRH) are described in section 6.4.1.2. Both particles in fact express illocutionary force
categories, that are in Abui associated with distinct grammatical constructions such as
serial constructions with ng ‘see’ (8.4.2.1) or ì ‘put’ (8.4.2.7), (cf. Dahl, 1999).   6.4.1.1     naha ‘not be/NEG’
Abui clause is negated with the verb naha ‘not be’. The negator follows the negated VP
and is glossed in this use as NEG. In (210), the negator naha follows the verb nee ‘eat’ in
(a) or the stative verb tukoi ‘be strong’ in (b) negates the whole clause:(210) a. al       loku di fe mahiting              nee       naha

verbal predicates. Shared negation in multi-verbal predicates indicates that they may be
considered as monoclausal structures. In (212), a number of verbs conjoined in a serial
verb construction are negated with naha (NEG) in (a). However, when only a part of
these verbs should be negated, the serial verb construction cannot be maintained.
Instead, as illustrated in (b), two clauses are joined together with the conjunction
marker haba ‘but’. The conjunction marker is followed by an intonational pause,
marked in the example with a comma.(212) a. e-buot           mi ba          lik         tah-a=ng            mihi-a     naha

           ‘take your basket but do not put it on the table’The verb naha ‘not be’ may occur as a single predicate in a clause and combine with
arguments, as illustrated in (213). In (a), naha ‘not be’ combines with a U argument
expressed with the REC prefix nu- (1PL.E.REC). In (b), it combines with the A argument
ri (2PL).

stems to precede it. As discussed in section 8.1.1, multi-verb constructions such as
serial verb constructions allow for (mainly) completive verb stems to occur without
aspectual inflection, if another verb follows. As illustrated in (216), the completive stem
-ién ‘see’ may precede the verb naha ‘not be’ without aspectual inflection, as illustrated
in (a). However, when the verb ién ‘see’ is the final verb in a clause, it must carry
aspectual inflection, as illustrated in (b).(216) a. di kuya do           nuku taka          h-ién         naha

       ‘Simon looked at the mobile phone and he did not understand it’           [B10.048.02]The examples (116)-(121) suggest that the location of the modifiers linked with ba
(LNK) with respect of the NP sometimes follows the NP template. Modifiers that
denote spatial position or possessor may precede the NP linked to them with ba (LNK).
Although semantically, the NP functions as the head of the structure, the headedness of
structures with ba (LNK) is problematic on the syntactic level, because the relative clause
or other linked modifier appears in two positions.
         Den Dikken (2006) presents an interesting cross-linguistic account of similar
structures that contain a linker and argues that it is actually the linker that is the ‘head’
of these structures. The other functions of ba seem to support this analysis (see 3.5.6).
The linker ba (LNK) probably originates in the verb ba ‘say’ that is grammaticalized to
an affirmative marker (6.4.2.1). The form ba is sometimes used as a copula, as
illustrated in (122). In (a), ba occurs as final constituent and serves as an optional
copula. Because the NP complement kaai ‘dog’ of the copula clause is itself a verb (the
stative verb kika ‘be red’) a copula is not necessary. However, the linking function of ba
is contrasted in (b), where it is grammaticalized to a relator glossed here as (LNK).(122) a. [kaai]copula topic [kika]copula complement       (ba)
         dog                 be.red                       COPULA/say
         ‘a dog is brown, a dog is really brown’
       b. kaai ba         {kika}RC
             dog LNK be.red
             ‘dog that is brown’
       4.6       Nominal predicates
A nominal predicate is an NP that serves as the main predicate of a sentence. In Abui,
there is no copula that links the nominal predicate with its argument. An example of

nominal predication is given in (123). In (a), the bare NP kalieta ‘old person’ serves as
nominal predicate. In (b), the NP moku fila ‘small child’ predicates over Fan Malei.(123) a. raha       kalieta                        b. Fan Malei moku              fila
         chief      old.person                           name            kid       be.young
         ‘the chief is an old person’                    ‘Fan Malei (is) a small child’In (124), the nominal predicates express names of objects or people.(124) a. [tafaa nuku [ha-ne                   yo]]NP [Mai Awen]NP
         drum       one      3II.INAL-name MD.AD name
         ‘there is one drum, its name is Mai Awen’                              [B06.041.09:00]
       b. [na-ne]NP           [Fani]NP
           1SG.INAL-name     name
           ‘my name is Fani’In (125), the NP upi nuku ‘one fruit’ is used in an equative sentence to quantify the NP
fu do ‘the betel nut’:(125) koi       do      mi-a            [he-fu     do]NP          [upi nuku]NP

      ‘in the basket, there is just one betel nut’                                [T004.02:12]The nominal predicates that express kind are linked with their argument by index verbs.
This is illustrated in (126) where the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ links the nominal
predicate with the NP Simon ayoku ‘two Simons’. The construction is contrasted with
nominal predicative construction in (b).(126) a. Simon       ayoku he-n-u                          muknehi
         name        two       3II.LOC-be.like.PRX.PRF     sibling.Ss
         ‘the two Simons are like siblings’                                       [B04.033.03]
       b. Simon        ayoku te-feela
           name        two       DISTR.AL-friend
           ‘the two Simons are friends’                                           [B04.033.03]In (127), a similar construction is given where the nominal predicate is replaced by the
question word nala ‘what’. Note that the question word nala ‘what’ is in-situ.(127) moku kiang nu             he-n-u                     nala? moku neng re mayol?
      kid       baby SPC.AD 3II.LOC-be.like.PRX-PRF        what kid       man     or woman

index verb wi-d- ‘be like.MD’ usually follows both NPs. This is illustrated in (128),
176                                      CHAPTER IV

Negator (NEG), prohibitive particles, affirmative predicate markers (APM), and
anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) are found in the right edge or right periphery of the
clause. Their ordering is schematically represented in (209).",[299]

The research reported here was conducted in the context of M.A.F. Klamer’s
‘Vernieuwingsimpuls’-project ‘Linguistic variation in Eastern Indonesia’ funded by the
Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). Fieldwork in 2004 was funded by
the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project.
      AcknowledgementsThis book is a linguistic account of an amazing journey. As a small boy I used to hear
stories about Indonesia from my father’s friend who worked there and found it the
most beautiful place on Earth. Later, during my studies in Nijmegen, I took courses in
Indonesian and fieldwork methods, and became convinced that I could travel to those
remote islands myself and describe a language.
        The first step of this journey started in Leiden in 2002. My whole-hearted
thanks belong to those who guided me patiently along the journey, and whom, as the
tradition dictates, I may not name.
        Many people accompanied me as the journey unfolded. In Leiden, I owe thanks
to my colleagues at Leiden University Centre for Linguistics for teaching, reading,
listening, good friendship, joyful company, culinary treats, and any possible
combination of these. They are Alwin Kloekhorst, Amir Tauber, Anikó Liptak, Aone
van Engelenhoven, Arie Verhagen, Birgitta Bexten, Boban Arsenijević, Chris Reintges,

Breugel, Seyoum Mulugeta, Stella Grilla, Tolemariam Fufa, Ton van der Wouden,
Vincent van Heuven. I would also like to thank Nelleke Goudswaard and Wilco van
den Heuvel for taking care of practical issues concerning language description.
        In Indonesia, I found hospitality and friends in many places. I thank Uri
Tadmor for sharing his fine home in Jakarta and his colleagues at MPI Field station,
Antonia Soriente and Betty Litamahuputty for a fine company. I am pleased to
acknowledge the official support that I have received from MPI Field station Jakarta
and in particular from Dr. Uri Tadmor as well as from Universitas Atma Jaya, Jakarta
and in particular from Professor Bambang Kaswanti Purwo. I owe many thanks to
Andreas Wijaya, Obing Katubi, Anisah Kortshak, Yunus Riadi Herman, Arnoldus Arif
Kusuma for their friendship and merry company and to Dani Martati for her delicious
cooking and care.
        In Kupang, June Jacob, John Haan, Flori Lake, Christo and Ben always helped
me around. Universitas Kristen Arthawacana Kupang supported my research. When I
stayed with Madah Biha’s family, it felt like home. I also thank Bapak Arkilaus Sabu and
Elias Ndiwa and their families for their great hospitality.
        Once the journey reached Alor, Karsten van der Oord introduced me to the
family of Chris Dani, who looked after me in Kalabahi and shared their home and
delicious food. Karsten took me out for diving, bought me strong liquors, told me a lot
about Alor and taught me how to chew betel nut. Sister Christa, Sister Gisela, Romo
Polce and Romo Toni showed me the pure and humble face of christianity. Many
thanks are directed to Andreas Malaikosa and Neil Johnston from SIL branch Alor. I
also thank Daniel Bekak and Ans Takalapeta who supported my research in Alor.

        Karsten van der Oord introduced me to Timoteus, Amalia, Dori, Orpa and
Simon Lanma, who took me in their family and treated me as their own. They taught
me their ‘straight’ language, as they call it. They took care of me in times of illness and
discomfort and made me laugh on so many occasions. I thank Benidiktus Delpada and
Waksi Maufani, who carried the daily linguistic burden with me, and they carried it so
well. I thank my little friends Fani, Fan Ata, Eman, Simon-Kakak, Lon-Rut, Orpa, and
Peni for taking me for trips to the jungle and teaching me so many things. I also thank
Nelis, Eben, Ande, Loni, Hilde, Nani, Lon Fan for being good villagers. I thank Bapak
Penku, Bapak Vinsen, Bapak Maiku, Bapak Aliku, Bapak Ande, Bapa Elias, and many
others for sharing their stories and language with me. They were tried to teach me the
‘straight’ Abui, but I am afraid it is still quite twisted.
        The first two trips I made together with Louise Baird and Peter Newman. They
looked after me in many ways wherever I went or stayed: in Leiden, Indonesia, and
Australia. Louise was a frustratingly hard-working officemate and a wonderful
colleague.
        In Australia, I am grateful to Bill Foley for valuable comments on many matters,
especially on generic verbs. I thank Andrew Pawley for his support and sharing his
knowledge. John Hajek helped me with Abui tones. I also thank John Bowden, Mark
Donohue and Gary Holton.
        Along the journey, I met my paranymph Floris Scheplitz. Floris accompanied
me on my last trip to Alor, conducting his own ethnobotanic research. It was a true
pleasure having him and Marloes around. I was blessed with the company of the
gentlemen Freek Otte, Eric Thomassen, Martin Vink, Frank de Wever, and Fred
Hamburg, with whom I spent many hours in De Bonte Koe and De Burcht, discussing
sacral and secular issues passionately. I thank Lewis Mayo, Julian Millie, Rati and Joe,
Ivana Hladká, Gershon Kaigere for their cheerful company and many nice dinners.
        I would like to thank my old friends Gerard van Poppel, Jasper van der Weerd,
the late Sjef van Tilborg, Tim Sparla, Tom Willems, Ineke de Kort, Lisette Crooijmans,
Kees van Dongen and Mieke Hoedemakers (with Berend and Willem) in Nijmegen;
Roy van Rijt en Hilde Beurskens in Haelen; Klaas en Anja Visser in Beemster; Kitty,
Marino, Sjoerd (and octopuses), Tijs, and Bas in Rijen; Kamila Krupičková, Johan
Deknopper, Fred Stroobants in Belgium, Martijn Cooijmans in London; and Tomáš
Langášek and Michal Kramář in the Czech Republic, for always being there even when
I was not there. Reinoud, Rienje and Jan visited me in Takalelang and cooked me plenty
good dinners. Thomas made it to Alor only in the belly, but was our companion in all
the following adventures.
        The Eastern European connection was taken care of by Boban Arsenijević, my
second paranymph, and his graceous company Dunce and Lidija. He appreciates
generic verbs, slivowitz, absurdity and melodramatic sentiment and knows that without
these, one gets easily lost, being far from one’s homeland.
        Joanna Sio became another eastern connection. She taught me to appreciate
general knowlegde, food-related metaphors and convinced me to move to Hong Kong.
Joanna helped me through the last months of writing this book.
        At the end of a proper journey, one should go home. I thank my family in the
Czech Republic for allowing me to go and learn that villages on the other side of this
planet are not that different from Dobroutov, the little village where we come from. I
remember those who passed away while I was not there.

                            1 Introduction
This book is a description of Abui, a Papuan language spoken on Alor Island in eastern
Indonesia. It presents essential parts of Abui grammar in a theoretically neutral way.
        This chapter contains some general information about Abui, its speakers and the
area in which Abui is spoken. This chapter is organised in the following fashion. The
geographic position of the area where Abui is spoken is defined in section 1.1. The
genetic affiliation of Abui, together with a brief overview of the historical sources
concerning Alor Island and Abui people, is discussed in section 1.2. In section 1.3 I
give some general information about the Abui community, the number of speakers,
their typical occupation and way of living. The linguistic situation of the area where
Abui is spoken is described in section 1.4. Information about the contexts in which

section 1.5 I give an overview of previous linguistic efforts focused on Abui; and in 1.6
I discuss Abui genetic affiliation. I present a typological sketch of Abui in section 1.7.
Section 1.8 discusses how the language data was collected. It describes the fieldwork

 The verb re ‘try’ is usually translated by Abui speakers into Malay with the verb coba ‘try, attempt’.
11Moreover, the Malay verb coba ‘try’ is grammaticalized to introduce conditional clauses in Alorese Malay.

       ‘I cannot do anything, I am stuck’, lit.: ‘I cannot detach myself and turn’   [B05.072.01]In some cases beka ‘be bad’ may be used to express epistemic modality; it indicates that
the expressed event is according to the speaker ‘unlikely’ to happen. Consider now the
use of beka ‘be bad’ in (67), where the verbs -liel ‘lift’ and beka ‘be bad’ share a single
argument expressed with the free pronoun di (3A).(67)   di      na-liel       beka
       3A    1SG.PAT-lift be.bad
       ‘he could not lift me up’                                                     [B06.017.07]
  8.3.4.3     SVC with kaleng ‘avoid’
The minor verb kaleng ‘avoid’ is used in modal SVCs to express the negative intention
or attitude of speaker. In (68), the minor verb kaleng ‘avoid’ is serialized with the major
verb me ‘come’. Both verbs share a single argument realized as the NP tuong ‘chief’
and indexed with the REC prefix on kaleng ‘avoid’:(68)   tuong me           do-kaleng
       chief     come     3I.REC-avoid
       ‘the chief does not want to come’                                             [B07.011.06]Another example is given in (69) where the minor verb kaleng ‘avoid’ combines with
wel ‘pour’. Both verbs share a single argument expressed by pronominal prefix on each
verb. In the second clause, the minor verb kul ‘must’ combines with the major verb wel
‘pour’ (more details about this type of modal SVC can be found in 8.4.7.1).(69)   da-wel        do-kaleng      haba di kul          da-wel-i

   8.3.4.4     SVC with ién ‘see’
The minor verb ién ‘see’ indicates potential modality but also strongly interacts with
aspect. It expresses that the referred event is in its initial stage: either it has started
already or it is about to start. Note that ién ‘see’ is the completive stem of the verb -ién
‘see’. In (71) -ién ‘see’ combines with the verb kariang ‘work’ indicating that Nani
might ‘work’. The verbs kariang ‘work’ and ién ‘see’ share a single argument expressed
with the NP Nani. The first part of the serial verb construction serves as a complement
of the verb -ién ‘see’ and is co-indexed with the PAT prefix h- (3II.PAT).","[392, 393, 394]"
"       5.9      Summary of Abui argument realization
In Abui, event participants are realized as A and/or U arguments. The choice of the
appropriate argument is determined by the semantic features of both events and
participants, represented in Figure 21 below. There are two macroroles actor (A) and
undergoer (U). The participants that have the features [+control], [+volition] are
realized as the A argument of a verb with an NP and/or a free pronoun. The
participants that are [+affected] are realized as the U argument of a verb with an NP
and/or bound pronoun. The choice between the NPs and pronouns is determined by
the features [±change of state], [±individuated] and [±specific].

(see 6.2.5).
              6 Verb Phrase and Clause
This first part of this chapter deals with the syntactic units headed by verbs: verb
phrases (VP). In a VP, Abui verb may either occur bare or associated with additional
morphology displaying person and aspect inflection of the head verb, as discussed in
6.1. In aspectual inflection, aspectual suffixes and/or clitics are attached to the verb to
indicate the aspectual properties of the referred event. I describe aspectual inflection in
6.1.1. In person inflection, pronominal prefixes indicate the number and type of the U
argument(s) of a verb. Person inflection is described in section 6.1.2
        Section 6.2 deals with clauses. In a clause, a VP may combine with arguments
realized with free pronouns and NPs. In section 6.2.1, I identify the basic constructions
in which a VP combines with its argument(s). Section 6.3 gives an overview of
adverbial modifiers found in the left edge. Negation, predicate markers, anaphoric
demonstratives and illocutionary force particles are found on the right edge or right
periphery. I discuss negation in section 6.4.1. Predicate markers are described in section
6.4.2. In 6.4.3, I deal with anaphoric demonstratives that follow a predicate.","[230, 231, 232]"
"  8.4.7.1   SVC with kul ‘must’
The verb kul ‘must’ is used to express deontic modality. An example is given in (203)
where kul combines with a single A argument:(203) Floris di kul Petumbang               yaa-r-i
      name 3A must place                    go-COMPL-PFV
      ‘Floris had to go to Petumbang’                                     [B10.053.05]The verb kul ‘must’ may occur in different syntactic positions as illustrated in (204)
with a distinct reading. In (a) the modal follows the pronoun forming a contiguous SVC
with sakoladi ‘learn’ and encoding deontic modality. However, in (b) the NP is
extracted in pragmatic position and the A marking free pronoun di (3A) intervenes
between kul and sakoladi ‘learn’. This non-contiguous SVC encodes epistemic
modality:(204) a. moku fil-a             di kul sakola-d-i=se
         kid       be.young 3A must school-hold-PFV=INCP.I
         ‘the small child must learn’                                     [B10.053.08]
       b. moku       fila        kul    di sakola-d-i=se
           kid       be.young must 3A school-hold-PFV=INCP.I
           ‘the small child is certainly about to learn’                  [B10.053.08]In instances such as (b) kul may be considered to be an adverb. Note that adverbs are
mainly found preceding the A argument in the left edge of a clause or in the clause-
initial pragmatic position. In some cases they are preceded by focussed argument.
Another instance of kul ‘must’ displaying adverbial features is given in (205). Here kul
indicates epistemic modality; the dog is reported to be ‘certainly’ lost:(205) he-kaai        kul kupai tama=ng             nai-d-i
      3II.AL-dog must forest            sea=see    lost-hold-PFV
      ‘his dog certainly got lost in the forest’                          [B07.023.01]To express alethic modality kul can be used. The presence of the food is qualified as
logical necessity by the speaker in the following example where kul combines with du
that is here used to express that food has to ‘accompany’ or simply ‘be there’:(206) nala     ma do         kul ha-d-u
      what    ripe PRX must 3II.PAT-hold-PRF
      ‘there must be food, one has to eat’                                [B07.014.03]

   8.4.7.2   SVC with kang ‘be good’
The verb kang ‘be good’ indicates that an event ‘really’ happened. An example is given
in (207) where kang is serialized with wel ‘pour’.(207) di      kang            da-wel
      3A      be.good         3I.PAT-pour
      ‘he is bathing’                                                                        [B07.073.02]The verb kang occurs frequently in narratives to indicate that the reported events truly
happened. Constructions with kang occurred frequently in elicitations of the Man Tree
game. 23 In the following example taken from a narrative the water bucket is being
reported as truly getting empty:(208) ya       do     di kang          taka-d-i                        do
      water PRX 3A be.good             be.empty-hold-PFV               PRX
      ‘the water (bucket) was empty again’                                                [B02.135.04:05]In modal SVC of the type illustrated above, the verb kang combines exclusively with
third person arguments expressed obligatorily with the free pronoun di (3A) and an
optional NP. This serial construction is a source of the adverb dikang ‘again’, an
instance of its use is given in (209). I analyze the form dikang as an adverb ‘again’,
because the A argument is expressed with second person singular free pronoun a (2SG).
More details can be found in section 6.3.(209) kopi    a      dikang              ma-r=te
      coffee 2SG again                   ripe-reach=INCP.C
      ‘make some coffee again’                                                               [B10.013.01]
   8.4.7.3     SVC with ra/re ‘reach’
The verb ra/re ‘reach’ occurs in serial construction to express speaker’s intention to
perform some activity. Abui verb ‘reach’ has two alternating stems: the inceptive stem
re ‘reach, try’ refers to reaching or trying that has an initial point. This verb is also used
in aspectual SVC illustrated in 8.3.1.3. The continuative stem ra ‘reach, attempt’ is used
when the event of trying has not clear initial and final point, it has a reading of ‘reach’
or ‘attempt, persist’. The minor verb ra/re ‘reach’ usually occurs in A≡UPAT
experiencer construction (6.2.5.2), expressing a single participant with both free and
bound pronoun. Consider now (210):
23 Man-Tree game is a MPI elicitation tool designed to provide stimuli and help elicit spatial reference andnavigation apparatus of a language. Language consultants are presented each an identical set of photographs.
One of the consultants is to describe the photographs that consequently have to be correctly identified by the
other consultant.

         ‘he tries to leave (obligation)’          ‘he tries to leave (deliberately)’ [B05.045.01]The single participant is realized as an experiencer as free and bound pronoun with
single reference in (a). In (b) it is expressed only as a free pronoun. The minor verb ra
‘reach, attempt’ expresses speaker’s intention to ‘leave’. The use of the inceptive re
‘reach, try’ is illustrated in (211) where it combines with the verb natet-d-i ‘stand up,
get standing’:(211) a-re                 natet-d-i!
      2SG.PAT-reach.ICP    stand.up.CPL-hold-PFV
      ‘stand up!’                                                                 [B05.044.05]The continuative ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ indicates an event as being performed in a
persistent way. The single (human) participant is realized as the U argument with the
PAT prefix. Because the speaker mostly expresses his ‘wish’ to perform an activity, the
free pronoun is omitted and the A≡UPAT experiencer construction is alternated, as
illustrated in (212). In both cases the major verb is inflected with perfective suffix -i
(PFV) although the expressed situation must be considered as an instance of irrealis
mode (cf. Payne 1997:244):(212) a. na-ra                we-i    b.        a-ra                    na-pun-i

‘still’ and has many similarities with an adverbial modifier. In (a), the item still can be
interpreted as a verb; however, in (b), the predicate dara does not show person
agreement with the A argument na (1SG). The form functions as an adverbial modifier
(see 6.3).(213) a. di da-ra              nala nee         naha
         3A 3I.PAT-reach.CNT what eat           NEG
         ‘he does not eat yet’                                                    [B07.021.05]

considering the restrictions on the use of the active pronouns with inanimates, it is
likely that the form dara in (214) is adverbial. It is quite obvious that the semantics of
the verb ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ can be easily extended to an adverbial use.

      ‘the thorn is still actually stuck in my foot’                            [B10.020.03]The verb ra ‘reach’ is sometimes used to refer to an event performed simultaneously by
more than one participant. In that case it combines with the distributive prefix ta-
(DISTR.PAT) that refers to the performing participants. The function of ra in such
instances is complex. It serves to introduce a multiple actor and indicates the realis
mode. Consider now the example (215):(215) Fan Malei ya        Fan Ata la            ta-ra                    de-kaai     bol

      ‘Fan Malei and Fan Ata each beat their dog there’                         [B07.076.02]In (215) ra combines with bol ‘hit’ sharing the multiple actor expressed with two proper
nouns Fan Malei and Fan Ata. These two participants are expressed as the U
argument of ra and also cross-referenced as the possessor of dekaai ‘their own dog’.
The SVC contains further the deictic verb la ‘be.MD’ indicating a ‘distant’ location of
the event. In some cases the whole minor verb might be reduplicated to indicate that
the participants perform the event simultaneously, but each of them on his own. This is
illustrated in (216) where ra combines with mok ‘bring together, pray’:(216) ta-ra-ta-ra                     mok
      RED[DISTR.PAT-reach.CNT]        bring.together
      ‘each prays on his own’                                                   [B04.019.03]Now compare the construction discussed in (215) with the construction given in (217).
Here the boys Fan Malei and Fan Ata beat simultaneously each his own dog. That
means that more than one dog is being beaten, while in (215) their single dog was
maltreated:(217) Fan Malei ya        Fan Ata ta-ra-ta-ra                       de-kaai bol
      name         SEQ name           RED[DISTR.PAT-reach.CNT] 3I.AL-dog hit
      ‘Fan Malei with Fan Ata beat each his dog on his own (different place, way)’ [B07.076.02]Also in this case the reduplication of the minor verb ra indicates that the participants
act simultaneously but each of them upon another undergoer.
                       Appendix: Abui texts
In this section I present a number of Abui texts. The first text is an ancestor story of
the Aila clan la teitu nikalieta. The second and third text are two fables about the
monkey and the turtle titled luka-luka ya yoikoi. The fourth text is the Abui version of
the Lord’s Prayer. The sixth text moku mayol is a description of a traditional bride
price negotiations and marriage. In the transcriptions I use the comma symbol to mark
a pause in intonation, longer pauses (where the speaker is thinking) are marked with the
plus symbol +, long pauses that mark the end of a discourse unit are marked with the
number sign #. Malay loans are given in bold case.                    la teitu nikalieta (ancestor story of Aila clan)
This story describes the ancestry and origin of the Aila clan that is a part of the
Takalelang village. The common ancestor of Aila clan is claimed to originate from the
Munaseli area of the neighbouring island Pantar. After an internal conflict some of the
ancestors left Munaseli and came up to Likwatang area.1 Having cultivated some areas
they came in contact with the original (Non-Austronesian) Abui speaking population
settled in Kewai above in the mountains. The mountain people did not have iron tools
and therefore they allowed the Aila people to stay and demanded iron tools from
them.2 After a conflict the Aila ancestors had to escape; one of the two brothers was
killed, while the other one managed to escape and built a village. Although he was
paying a tribute to the Kewai, his village was attacked and burnt down. Only a couple
managed to escape. The woman was pregnant; she gave birth to a child and was taken
back by her family. The Aila clan members count their origin from her. In the recent
past they were summoned by the government and the church to come down from their
village on the mountain top and move to the new settlement Kameng Taha. The
relocation of the village happened during the lifetime of the old story-teller Alfred
Maufani. His ironic allusions describe the relocation as a well-meant intention of the
government and the church to let everybody dwell in peace together. The style of the
story is rich with frequent parallelisms and direct speech, and frequent resuming of the
previous (tail head linkage). The number of Malay loans is very limited.","[437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442]"

8.1.1         Grammatical characteristics of Abui SVC
In the previous sections, I have taken the liberty to refer to the constructions involving
‘verb clusters’ occurring in the same sentence as SVCs. In this section I will actually
show that these constructions meet the established characteristics defining SVCs as
listed in (3). I discuss the characteristics listed in (3) in turn below:
         MONOCLAUSAL UNITS. In Abui, there are verb clusters, which express what
might be seen as conceptualized as a single event. In these verb clusters, the verbs
combine without any coordination or subordination markers occurring between the
2An indirect supporting evidence for the claim that SVCs express what is the conceptualized as a single event
comes from elicitation with the Cut and Break Clips (Böhnemeyer et al., 2001). Language consultants
produced a detailed account, using multi-verbal constructions.

verbs. This property is illustrated in (4) with the verbs me ‘come’ and yai paneng ‘sing’,
these verbs combine to form a single clause:3(4)      moku me                yai        paneng
         kid       come     song make

units without conjunction markers (i). Abui verb clusters have the same property, as
illustrated in (4).
         CONTIGUOUS CONSTRUCTION. The verb clusters such as in (4) are contiguous; no
constituents except the arguments may intervene between the verbs. This is further
illustrated in (5) where the form afeida ‘yesterday’ expressing the time of the event must
precede the verbs tilei ‘hang (out)’ and lol ‘walk’, see (a). It is ungrammatical to place a
non-argument constituent such as afeida ‘yesterday’ between the verbs of the verb
cluster, see (b):(5)      a. afeida           na kantor loku to-tilei                          lol-e

constructions that allow only arguments to intervene between the verbs, see (ii). Other
constituents are not allowed to intervene between the verbs.
        SHARED INTONATION CONTOUR. Verb clusters such as in (4) and (5) share a
single intonation contour similar to that of a monoverbal clause and not to that of a
sequence of clauses. There is no intonation break (typically indicating a clause
boundary) between the verbs. As listed in (3), serial verb constructions are cross-
linguistically characterized by intonational properties of a monoverbal clause.
        SHARED ASPECTUAL INFLECTION. The verbs in verb clusters such as illustrated in
(4) and (5) share the aspectual inflection in most cases. This is illustrated in (6) where
the verbs wai ‘turn back’ and kok ‘prod’ in (a) share the aspectual markers -u (PRF) and
te (INCP.I). The verbs yaa ‘go’ and sik ‘sever’ in (b) share the imperfective aspectual
suffix -e (IPFV):
3 The verbs that are serialized in (4) may be combined using a conjunction marker. In the following example,
the verbs me ‘come’ and yai paneng ‘sing’ combine in a complex sentence. The sentence consists of two
clauses linked with the sequential linker ya (SEQ). Constructions like this one will not be considered SVCs.(1)   moku me           ya yai         paneng

           ‘resume prodding!’, lit.: ‘turn back, prod it!’            ‘I am going to harvest rice’         In the literature about Papuan languages, a distinction is made between FINAL
and MEDIAL verbs (cf. Foley, 1986:176). Final verbs, as their name suggests, are those
verbs that appear in the final position of a verb cluster or verb chain and carry the
verbal inflections. Medial verbs, as their name suggests, are those verbs that appear in
non-final positions and do not carry the same verbal inflections. The verbal inflections
mentioned by Foley (1986:176) include inflections for person and tense.
         In Abui, the only inflections that appear following the verb stem are aspectual
markers. However, a similar distinction can be made between the verbs in a verb
cluster. Only the final verb of a verb cluster appears to carry the aspectual inflections.
The ‘medial verb(s)’ in a verb cluster appear bare, without aspectual inflections. In
Abui, a large set of verbs alternate their stems depending on the aspectual inflection
that follows, cf. 3.4.2.3. Some of these stems are bound forms that cannot function as
predicates in monoverbal clauses. They always require the aspectual inflection.
However, these bound stems may appear as ‘middle verbs’ within a verb cluster, as
illustrated in (7). In (a), the stem yaar ‘go’ is used as medial verb of a verb cluster. In
(b), the verb stem yaar ‘go’ is used as predicate in monoverbal clause, but such use is
ungrammatical as the stem yaar ‘go’ is a bound verb stem; it would require a perfective
suffix -i (PFV).(7)    a. ri    yaar      kan-r-i                                       b. *ri yaar

           ‘you go completely, lit.: you go finish’ [B02.040.12:44]In (3), serial verb constructions are cross-linguistically characterized by shared verbal
inflections (iv). In Abui, verb clusters such as (7) share aspectual inflection. They
display the same characteristic as what was defined as serial verb constructions (see also
8.1.2).
         SHARED NEGATION. In Abui, verbs clusters share negation expressed with the
negator naha (NEG). In a monoverbal clause, the negator follows the verb. In verb
clusters the negator follows the final verb of the cluster negating both verbs. This is
illustrated in (8) where in (a) the negator naha (NEG) appears following the final verb
and both verbs are negated. The negator may not intervene between the two verbs (b):(8)    a. Fani di Waksi he-l                       tahai     naha

listed in (3). As illustrated in (8), Abui verb clusters display the same property.

        SHARED ARGUMENTS. In Abui, verbs in a verb cluster share at least one argument.
This argument is either an A or a U argument. This is illustrated in (9). The verbs wai
‘turn back’, mi ‘take’, and r ‘reach’ are conjoined in a verb cluster. They share the A
argument Simon. However, not all verbs of the cluster share their U arguments. The U
argument of -wai is expressed as the NP ne-seng ‘my money’ and co-indexed with the
PAT prefix ha- on the verb. The verb mi ‘take’ is shares the A argument with -wai
‘turn’. The benefactive participant is realized as the U argument of the verb r ‘reach’
with the LOC prefix ne-:        N PA         NPU1            PROU1-V        V        PROU2-V

        ‘Simon gave me back my money’However, it is unclear whether the NP ne-seng ‘my money’ is also a U argument of the
verb mi ‘take’, because no pronominal prefix appears. As listed in (3), shared arguments
are one of the characteristics of serial verb constructions. Abui verb clusters display this
characteristics just as other mentioned characteristics. Therefore, it is justified to refer
to them henceforth as serial verb constructions (SVCs).","[371, 372, 373, 374]"

  6.3.1.8    yang ‘perhaps’
The adverb yang ‘perhaps’ indicates epistemic modality and is used to express speaker’s
doubts about the reality of the reported event. Neutrally, yang occurs between the
arguments as illustrated in (172).(172) kaai     do     yang rui             tahai

by the adverb ko ‘soon’ and wan ‘already’.(173) yang       ko      he-lui        wan       nai-d-i

   6.3.1.9     sawai ‘in vain’
The adverb sawai ‘be in vain’ encodes that the effort of the participant is fruitless. The
adverb sawai is related to the verb sai ‘put along’ and also to the form sai-sai ‘in vain,
vainly’ (see 8.4.6.4). An example of such construction is given in (174) where sawai ‘be
in vain’ combines with the verb tahai ‘search’.

‘distant’ from the speaker (for more details see section 8.4.4.3). Another example is
given in (175), where sawai ‘in vain’ combines with the verb wit ‘carry in arms’. Note
that it is preceded by the verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ that indicates that the event is unknown to
the addressee.(175) na     fa          sawai     kafaak wit                    ba       we-i       haba,

       ‘I actually brought the tobacco in vain (to the market), people did not buy anything’
  6.3.1.10 taka ‘only’
The adverb taka ‘only’ indicates that the participant performed only a restricted part of
an event. It probably originates in the verb taka ‘be empty’. It combines with the major
verb nee ‘eat’ in (176) sharing the argument mahiting ‘meat’:(176) Fan Malei di mahiting             taka nee
      name          3A meat             only   eat

the ‘cognitive’ location of the event as ‘distant’ from the speaker, as the speaker refrains
from performing it:(177) di     ma           làk-e            ne-ì      la            taka he-wahai          naha

expresses the first person participant. Together with the negator naha it indicates the
participant refusing the obligation to look at the other participant (cf. 8.4.2.7).   6.3.1.11 bai ‘as well’
The adverb bai ‘as well’ originates in the verb ba ‘say’ inflected for perfective aspect
that serves as confirmative marker (see 6.4.2.2). As illustrated in (178), it is glossed as
‘as well’ whenever it directly precedes the predicate of a clause.

distinguished from the form ba-i that follows the predicate and consists of the verb ba
‘say’ which is inflected for perfective aspect. In (179), two instances are given where ba-
i follows the predicate. In (a) it serves as confirmative marker (see 6.4.2.2); while in (b)
it introduces a conditional clause.(179) a. Mai Awen hu           pi      he-ananra          ba-i!

6.3.2    Deictic demonstratives
As adverbial modifiers, deictic demonstratives indicate the location of an event in
space. As discussed in 3.5.2, demonstratives may occur in both the nominal domain and
the verbal domain. In both domains, demonstratives may occur in two syntactic
positions. They either precede or follow the head. In a clause, deictic demonstratives
precede the VP, the anaphoric demonstratives follow it. When the demonstrative
precedes the head verb of a VP, it refers to the location of the event. When it follows
the head verb, it locates the event expressed by the VP in discourse (see also 4.4.3).
In the following examples, I illustrate the use of the deictic demonstratives as adverbial
modifiers. In (180), the deictic demonstrative do (PRX) locates the event ‘here’ by the
speaker.(180) a      do      mi-a         maiye, ama       e-l                feng kang

proximate location with respect to the addressee. The verb ba ‘say’ is grammaticalized
as an affirmative marker (see 6.4.2).","[290, 291, 292]"

9 In Stokhof (1984:125) the forms such as ning or fal are analyzed as a morpheme that is part of a complexpronoun. The form ning is analyzed as a classifier ‘indicating more than one human being’, however, this
form only combines with nouns. The Ateng Melang form fa corresponding to fal is identified in Stokhof
(1984:128) as ‘together’ but its categorial membership is not specified.
10 Index verbs are also found in the neighbouring language Adang (cf. Haan 2001:259-274).

to the kind of the referent. The indexed events and referents are located on the familiar
PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL axis. This axis is found also in Abui demonstratives and
deictic verbs. Note that the perfect stems nu and hu have been grammaticalized as
anaphoric demonstratives indicating ‘specificity’. For more details, see section 3.5.2.2.
        Abui index verbs are used in questions and in constructions that express the
kind of the referent. The kind of a referent and the manner of an event is described in a
complement clause that serves as an argument of the index verb.11 The proximal index
verbs na/ni/n-u ‘be like.PRX’ are used to refer to the manner and kind obvious and
familiar to both speech participants. The medial index verbs wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ are
frequently used in questions. The speaker presents the questioned manner or kind as
medial. The distal index verbs ha/hi/h-u ‘be like.DST’ are used to refer to manner or
kind that is not familiar to the speaker. The verb ha ‘be like.DST’ may be used to refer
to the manner in which the addressee intends to perform an event, from which the
speaker wants to dissociate himself.
        An example of the manner anaphoric use is given in (112). The verb stem wa
‘be like.MD’ combines with the argument, expressed with the pronominal prefix do-
(3I.REC). It refers to the rain that prevented the participant from going to the market.(112) anui sei                   hare do-wa                   anu=ng                       yaar       naha

ha ‘be like.DST’ occurs as a single predicate in a question. This question is used in
situation when the Abui equivalent of the Malay word anjing ‘dog’ is asked:(113) ‘anjing’ nu          nala ha?

(3II.LOC). It marks the first clause as a manner in which the event described in the11 Index verbs semantically group the manner of event (in fact kind of event) and the kind of referent inadnominal and question uses. In the literature similar predicates were referred to as kind-anaphoric predicates
(cf. Landman and Morzycki, 2003:11).

clause. While I was recording Simon learning to shoot with a bow, I was urged to stop

marker ba follows a fronted NP that serves as a nominal predicate expressing the topic.
Typically it is followed by an intonational pause, marked here with a comma.(130) [sameng]TOP ba, Pak Kas di mi ba                    Takpala maran-i           o

               5 Argument Realization
In this chapter, I discuss Abui argument realization. Event participants are realized as
different arguments of a verb with NPs and/or pronouns. The choice of the
appropriate realization is determined by the semantic properties of the participant. This
is discussed in section 5.1. The controlling and volitional participants are identified for
the actor (A) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or free pronouns. The affected
participants are identified for the undergoer (U) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or
bound pronouns. The listed criteria apply to arguments in both transitive and
intransitive constructions.
        The choice between a pronoun and an NP is determined by the referential
properties of the participant. In section 5.2, I show that arguments with a specific
reference are expressed with pronouns and optional NPs; arguments with a non-
specific reference are expressed with NPs. In section 5.3, I discuss the A arguments
that are expressed with free pronouns. In section 5.4, the U arguments expressed with
bound pronouns are described. There are three distinct sets of bound pronouns that
may express the U arguments. As discussed in section 5.5, the choice of a bound
pronoun is determined by the semantic properties of the participants such as
[±individuated] and [±change of state]. In section 5.6, I focus on the U argument in
transitive constructions. I illustrate multiple ways in which the U argument can be
expressed. In section 5.7, the argument realization in intransitive constructions is
discussed. The single participant of the intransitive verb may be realized as the A or U
argument. In section 5.8, I present a diachronic analysis of the bound pronouns.
Finally, in section 5.9 an overview of the argument realization is given.","[199, 200]"

The marker se (INCP.I) indicates that the speaker is at the point before he will start to
‘come down’. The marker te (INCP.C) views the event of ‘coming down’ as just about to
be completed.(43)   a. na      saai=se                                  b. na         saai=te

of examples are given in (44). In all cases the aspectual suffixes and markers combine
their meaning together. The referred event is viewed as having a final boundary

  6.1.1.8    Phasal aspect markers si (PHSL.I) and ti (PHSL.C)
The phasal aspect marker si (PHSL.I) refers to the point just after the start of an event.
The marker ti (PHSL.C) indicates the point right after an event has finished. Both
markers are formally related to the inceptive markers. In fact, the inceptive and phasal
224                                      CHAPTER VI
markers have reversed functions: inceptive markers refer to the point just before, while
phasal markers refer to the point just after. In (46), both phasal markers are contrasted.(46)   a. di sei=si                                          b. di yaa=ti
            3A come.down.CNT=PHSL.I                               3A go=PHSL.C
            ‘he has just started coming down’ [B02.123.02:06]     ‘he just went’ [B02.086.07:47]The phasal inceptive marker si (PHSL.I) in (46) indicates that the event of ‘coming down’
has just started. The phasal completive marker ti (PHSL.C) indicates that the event of
‘going’ just finished. Note that the marker ti (PHSL.C) does not require the completive
stem of ‘go’ yaar. Another contrastive pair of examples is given in (47).(47)   a. Arjun di he-wahai=si                     Mai Fan do-làk
            name     3A 3II.LOC-look=PHSL.I name                3I.REC-leave.for

            ‘Arjun has just finished looking (how) Maifan is leaving’              [B06.008.01]The phasal markers are often used with complement clauses that follow the verb. An
example is given in (48), where the verb piei-l-a ‘dream’ combines with the phasal
marker ti (PHSL.C) and is followed by a complement clause that expresses the content of
the dream. The complement clause contains the affirmative marker ba that indicates
that the reported event really happened (see also 6.4.2.1).(48)   na     piei-l-a=ti                na-noting         Kalang-Fat       yaa    ba

marker ti (PHSL.C) and is followed by a complement clause that expresses the content of
what was said.(49)   a      tah-a               he-fanga=ti                a      ko      me     ba yo

       ‘you were just saying that you would come’                              [B07.010.02]Another use of phasal marker is to introduce a conditional clause in (50)-(51). In (50),
the clause do-mon=ti ‘he died’ introduces a hypothetical condition for the statement
expressed in the clause kang ‘it would be good’.(50)   palaka         hare la          do-mon=ti                  kang

In (51), the first clause ending with the aspectual marker ti (PHSL.C) expresses the
condition of ‘being rich’ followed by the statement in the second clause.(51)    a      kawaisa       ho-mi        mi-a=ti              a   no-ta-wang?

        ‘if you would become rich, would you still greet me/remember me?’ [B05.065.02]
6.1.2       Person inflection and valence
In Abui, the head of a VP may carry person inflection in addition to aspectual inflection
discussed in 6.1.1. Person inflection appears in the form of pronominal prefixes (see
3.3.2). Syntactically, these prefixes are (anaphoric) pronouns that express [+specific]
arguments (see 5.2). Abui verbs appear in a number of transitive and intransitive
constructions. Almost no Abui verb is restricted to a single construction but most verb
stems can be characterized as ‘labile’ (see 6.2.1). Except for the intransitive stative
verbs, most Abui verbs appear with one or two arguments. In my corpus, there are no
instances of ditransitive verbs; in description of events involving three participants
various types of serial verb constructions are used instead (see 8.4.2).
        In this section, I illustrate on a sample of verbs that a verb stem may occur in
transitive, intransitive, and experiencer construction. I discuss the verbs following their
morphological type: (i) free stems that may occur as a VP; (ii) bound stems that
obligatorily carry person inflection (see also 3.4.2.2). Both types are discussed in
sections 6.1.2.1 and 6.1.2.2 respectively.","[245, 246, 247, 248]"
"
3.5.1     Adjectives
In Abui, the grammatical category of adjectives contains only six items. They refer to
the properties of participants such as colour, size or age just as stative verbs (see
3.4.4.8). Adjectives are differentiated from the stative verbs because they cannot head a
VP. This is illustrated in (120), where the adjectives akan ‘black’ and abet ‘young’
modify the head noun (a, b), and cannot head a VP (c, d). In order to be used as head
of a VP, the adjectives akan ‘black’ and abet ‘young’ must combine with a generic root
in a complex verb. In (e, f), the adjectives combine with the generic root ì ‘put’.

‘white’ are given. It is possible, that the adjectival category contains a few more
members, which I have not found yet. However, most words that refer to participant
properties such as colour, size or age are stative verbs.(121) a. mayol maek                                    b. moku        dakun

3.5.2    Demonstratives
Demonstratives are forms that indicate the location of a referent or event in space or
discourse. They are mainly monosyllabic forms (except for oro) that terminate in the
vowel /ɔ/. Demonstratives may combine with nouns, verbs on the phrase level, and
with clauses on the sentence level.
        Demonstratives that locate the referent in space are the deictic demonstratives;
they always precede the head noun of an NP. Demonstratives that indicate the location
of the referent in discourse are anaphoric demonstratives; they follow the head noun.
In combination with verbs, the function of Abui demonstratives is analogous to the
nominal domain. When the demonstrative precedes the head verb of a VP, it refers to
the location of the event. When it follows the head verb, it locates the event expressed
by the VP in discourse.
        In this section, I first give an overview of Abui deictic demonstratives (see
3.5.2.1), and then discuss the anaphoric demonstratives (see 3.5.2.2). Details about the
usage of the demonstratives in the nominal domain can be found in section 4.4.3;
details about the functions of demonstratives in verbal domain in sections 6.3.2 and
6.4.3.

   3.5.2.1    Abui deictic demonstratives
Abui deictic precede the head constituent and indicate the spatial location of the head
constituent. As in other domains of Abui grammar, the demonstratives are organized
along the relative frame of reference based in either speaker or addressee. The
horizontal distance from the deictic centre is categorized by the axis
PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL. The vertical location is specified only for medial and distal
referents. As illustrated in (122), the noun sura ‘book’ combines with proximal deictic
demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). Following Levinson (2003), these deictic
demonstratives refer to the proximate location of a figure (F) with respect of the
viewpoint (V). In (a), the viewpoint is located at the speaker, while in (b); it is located at
the addressee. Often the addressee based demonstrative is used to draw addressee
attention. Mostly, the speaker based demonstrative is used.(122) a. do           sura                         b. to            sura
         PRX          book                            PRX.AD       book
         ‘this book (near me)’                        ‘this book (near you)’In other words, these deictic demonstratives have a relative frame of reference (cf.
Levinson 2003:43-47). They refer to a location with alternating viewpoint (V) over
speaker or addressee (cf. Levinson 2003:24-61).
        The second axis of Abui deictic systems is a horizontal axis that measures the
distance of F from the ground (G). As illustrated in (123), a nearby horizontal distance
of F is expressed with the deictic demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). I refer to
these deictic demonstratives as ‘proximal’. A distant position of F with respect to G is
indicated with the deictic demonstratives o (MD) and yo (MD.AD) that alternate V over
the speaker and the addressee. In (e), the far distance of F, further than the previous
one, is expressed with the deictic oro (DST). In the distal position the alternation of V
does not apply.(123) a. do           fala                         b. o      fala
         PRX          house                           MD house
         ‘this house (near me)’                       ‘that house there (further from me)’
       c. to             fala                      d. yo            fala
           PRX.AD       house                         MD.AD house
           ‘this house (near you)’                    ‘that house there (further from you)’
       e. oro     fala
           DST house
           ‘that house over there (far from us)’The last axis constituting the Abui deictic system is the vertical axis. This axis does not
apply to proximate positions and is absolute (V cannot be alternated). The deictic
demonstratives in (124) refer to vertically oriented positions of F. Medial (less
proximate) positions are expressed with the low medial deictic ò (MD.L) and high medial
deictic ó (MD.H); distal positions are referred to with the low distal deictic wò (DST.L)
and high distal deictic wó (DST.H). The suprasegmental features of a deictic form

6.3.1     Adverbs
Adverbial modifiers are typically adverbs. In Abui, there is a small set of adverbs such
as yal ‘now’, el ‘before’, ko ‘soon’, wan ‘already’ (see also 3.5.5). Their function as
adverbial modifiers is illustrated below.   6.3.1.1     yal ‘now’
The adverb yal ‘now’ locates an event in present time (temporal location overlapping
with the time of speech). In (162), the adverb yal ‘now’ occurs in left edge position in
(a), and is extracted to the focus position in (b), where it combines with the anaphoric
demonstrative do (PRX).(162) a. yal di miei                             b. yal       do       di wan        làk-e

In about the half of all occurrences of yal ‘now’ in my corpus, the adverb combines
with the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX), which I analyze as forming a separate
adverbial phrase, located in the periphery, in fact, outside the clause.   6.3.1.2    el ‘before’
The adverb el ‘before, earlier on’ indicates that the event is antecedent to the time of
speech. As illustrated in (163), el ‘before’ occurs either between the A and U argument
(a) or may be extracted to the focus position (b).(163) a. na el          kopi buut-i

marker.   6.3.1.3       wan ‘already’
The adverb wan ‘already’ indicates that an event occurred in time preceding the time of
speech. The adverb wan ‘already’ occurs typically between the A and U argument. This
is illustrated in (164). In (b), it is found preceding the VP and following the clause anui
sei ‘it rains’, which expresses the single argument of the verb kan-d- ‘get finished’.(164) a. di wan          yai paneng
         3A already song make
         ‘he is already singing’                                              [B10.053.10]

   6.3.1.4     ko ‘soon’
The adverb ko ‘soon’ indicates that the referred event will occur in near future. It is
illustrated in (165), where in (a) it occurs in the neutral position and in (b) it precedes
the A argument.(165) a. a ko        fat takd-a         naha?         b. ko        anui sei

   6.3.1.5       kal ‘another time’
The adverb kal ‘another time, next time’ indicates a future event that will certainly
occur. It often combines with the other adverb ko ‘soon’ that must follow. Its use is
exemplified in (166), where in (a) kal ‘another time’ occurs in the neutral position, while
in (b), it is fronted.(166) a. Fani       kal          ko   sei?

   6.3.1.6     dara ‘still’
The adverb dara ‘still’ originates in the verb ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ (see 8.4.7.3). It
indicates that an event is performed in a persistent way. The adverb dara ‘still’ may be
combined with negation to refer to events that have not occurred yet. In (167), the
adverb dara ‘still’ combines with the verb afei-d-a ‘be yesterday, lit.: become passed’
(see also 6.3.3.7).(167) yambuk do           dara afei-d-a                  hu lik        tah-a=ng

not visited the village named Ruilak yet.(168) na dara Ruilak làk                  naha haba, na la        ha-piet-i

   6.3.1.7    wala ‘so’
The adverb wala ‘so, only’ indicates a manner in which the event is performed, typically
it indicates the extension of an event or the quantity of participants. In (169), the
adverb wala ‘so’ indicates how many items were taken.(169) di     sua buti wala mi               ba      nee-i

In (170), a fragment of a bride price negotiation is given. As the good custom requires,
a lot of betel nut has to be consumed during such an event. A number of old men
discuss whether they have some betel nut or proceed negotiating. One of the men
brings betel nut and betel vine and utters the following construction. The adverb wala
‘so’ indicates that the other men may take betel vine if they wish ‘so’.(170) meting to                ri       wala mi ui             h-iéng….

             3 Grammatical Categories
In this chapter, I describe Abui grammatical categories. Grammatical categories are
sometimes referred to as ‘part-of-speech classes’; they are the building blocks of
linguistic structures. Grammatical categories are either open or closed. Open categories
contain a virtually unlimited number of items, while closed categories have a limited set
of members. In Abui, open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed
grammatical categories are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers,
adverbs and question words.
        In Abui, many lexical items appear to be ambiguous. Their categorial
membership must be determined by the combination of their distributional, functional,
and semantic properties (cf. Schachter, 1985; Andward et al., 1997). With the term
‘distributional properties’ I refer to the word-internal (morphological) and word-
external (syntactic) distribution of an item. In section 3.1, I give an overview of Abui
morphology describing various morpheme types (bound, free, prefixes, suffixes, roots,
and stems).
        Word-external (syntactic) distributional properties refer to the status of items in
syntactic units such as phrases, clauses and sentences. Items may be restricted in their
distribution within syntactic units; not all items may occur as heads. Items have
different functional properties. They can express various grammatical functions such as
arguments, aspectual markers, or linkers. Finally, items can have a different type of
reference (time-stable or versatile) and different referents (persons, events, etc.).
        In section 3.2, I describe nouns. Nouns are items that canonically refer to time-
stable concepts such as persons, objects or places. The nominal reference is permanent.
Pronouns are discussed in section 3.3. Pronouns refer to time-stable concepts,
however, their reference is not permanent as the nominal reference but versatile and
context dependent. In section 3.4, I discuss Abui verbs. Verbs are defined
morphologically as items that may combine with REC pronominal prefix and aspectual
markers. Syntactically, they are the head of a verb phrase. Verbs serve as predicates in a
clause and may combine with arguments.
        The remainder of this chapter gives an overview of closed grammatical
categories; they are discussed in section 3.5. The closed grammatical categories are
adjectives (3.5.1), demonstratives (3.5.2), quantifiers (3.5.3), aspectual markers (3.5.4),
conjunction markers (3.5.6), adverbs (3.5.5), and question words (3.5.7).","[88, 89, 90]"

          4 Nouns and Noun Phrases
In this chapter, I discuss Abui nouns and noun phrases. Abui nouns are defined by
their referential properties as lexical items referring to time-stable concrete entities
(unique persons, places, or objects, discussed in 4.1). There are also lexical items that
refer to less concrete (typically) uncountable objects and substances. These lexical items
are ambiguous as they may as well refer to events, and they are analysed as categorially
indetermined (see section 3.2.2). Their grammatical category is determined by their
syntactic context. When an ambiguous item is inserted in the head position of an NP
structure; it is identified as a noun.
        In Abui, there is a systematic difference between animate and inanimate
referents. Animate referents are typically expressed by unambiguously nominal lexical
items. Nouns referring to animates are treated differently in grammatical operations
such as possessive inflection or person inflection on the verbs (see 3.2.4). Inanimate
nouns have a more generic reference and denote substances rather than individuated
objects; they are underspecified for number, shape or size. In discourse, inanimate
nouns often combine with other elements that specify their number, shape, or size.
        Abui nouns combine with pronominal prefixes that express possessors (see
section 4.2). Nouns can be derived by compounding and nominalization of verbal
roots, as discussed in section 4.3. Nouns serve as the head constituent of a noun
phrase, presented in section 4.4. In addition to possessors, the head noun combines
with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives, modifier nouns,
stative verbs, adjectives, quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives. The order of these
constituents is fixed (see 4.4.5). Optionally, an NP may contain an embedded modifier,
typically a relative clause (see section 4.5). Besides expressing arguments, NPs may
serve as the main predicate of a sentence, as a nominal predicate. This chapter ends
with an overview of nominal predicates in section 4.6.","[154, 155, 156]"
"
6 Stokhof (1984:137) states that the modifiers follow the head in the order: attribution, quantification,
specification.

       ‘boy’                                             ‘girl’I argue that these structures consist of a head noun followed by a modifier noun. I will
refer to them as [N-modifier noun] NPs. There are two pieces of evidence to analyze
these structures as NPs. First, in syntactic operations, the [N-modifier noun] structures
can be separated; they are not a single unit as compounds. As illustrated in (69), the
head of the [N-modifier noun] NP wil neng ‘son’ can occur as a bare NP wil ‘child’ in
the following clause.(69)   kalieta         neng nuku ai          bikil miei          ya      faling   mi     ya
       old.person      man    one     side   left   come.CPL SEQ         axe      take   SEQ       [de-wil         neng]NP he-tàn-i                        [he-wil]NP di mi          ba
       3I.AL-child     man          3II.LOC-release.CPL-PFV    3II.AL-child    3A take   LNK
       ara ha-wot-i
       fire 3II.PAT-throw.CPL-PFV
       ‘one old man came from the left side and gave an axe to his son, his child took it and cut
       the firewood’                                              [B06.073.MPI160MW]Because the right constituent is omitted and the left constituent re-occurs, the left
constituent must be the head and in consequence the structures as wil neng ‘son’ are
NPs. In contrast, compounds are right-headed structures that are lexicalized; their
internal structure is not ‘visible’ for syntactic operations and none of the constituents
may be omitted.
        The second piece of evidence is comes from morphology. Consider the
structure wil neng ‘son’ (lit.: ‘child man’) in (70). In (a), this structure combines with
possessive inflection. In (b, c), the possessive marking appears on each of the nouns
wil ‘child’ and neng ‘man’ independently. The meaning of the possessed structure ne-
wil neng ‘my son’ corresponds to ne-wil ‘my child’ and not to ne-neng ‘my husband’.
From this we can conclude that the structure wil neng ‘son’ is left-headed and
therefore an NP.

plants.(71)   moku       bilel                     kaai bilel                    fat     bilel

       cockroach sprout                     locust sprout
       ‘little cockroach’                   ‘little locust’In the introduction of this chapter, I argued that many nouns with inanimate reference
denote substances rather than well-defined objects. These nouns typically combine with
modifier nouns that specify their shape and size. In enumeration, the modifier noun
typically co-occurs with the quantifier because the head noun is not sufficiently
individuated to be quantified (see also 4.4.4.1). This is illustrated in (72), where the head
noun seng ‘money’ combines with two modifier nouns that specify the shape of the
‘money’ substance. The banknotes are referred to as watala ‘leaves’, while for coins the
modifier noun tipai ‘iron’ is used to indicate the material from which this type of

leaves or iron, which would be the case if these structures were compounds.(72)   seng     watala                                        seng      tipai

4.4.2     Verbs and Adjectives
In an NP, stative verbs and adjectives serve to specify some property of the head noun
(cf. Payne 1997:63). As illustrated in (75), stative verbs and adjectives follow the head
noun. In (a), the adjective kul ‘white’ follows the head noun kaai ‘dog’, as well as the
stative verbs kiding ‘small’, foka ‘big’ and fila ‘young’ in (b-d):(75)    a. kaai kul                                                b. fala   kiding

            ‘white dog’                                               ‘small house’
        c. bataa      foka                                         d. moku      fila

            ‘big tree’                                                ‘little child’As discussed in section 3.5.1, adjectives are syntactically differentiated from stative
verbs. Both grammatical categories may serve as modifiers in an NP, but stative verbs
may also serve as a head of a VP and combine with a single argument. In Abui,
arguments always precede the verb, which means that a structure consisting of a noun
followed by a stative verb is ambiguous and may be interpreted either as an NP or as a
VP. On the other hand, the adjectives cannot be used as predicates, heading a VP.
These properties are summarized in Table 18:                    Table 18: Distributional properties of adjectives and stative verbs
                      GRAMMATICAL CATEGORY NP DOMAIN VP DOMAIN                                 ADJECTIVE               Modifier            *
                                STATIVE VERB             Modifier        PredicateThe functional asymmetry between adjectives and stative verbs has a consequence, that
only the structures consisting of a noun followed by an adjective are unambiguous NPs.
This restricted functional property of a noun phrase with an adjectival modifier is
further exemplified in (76). In (a, d, g) the adjective modifier of the noun phrase has an
attributive function, but as illustrated in (b, e, h) it does not have a predicative function.
Instead a complex verb must be used that incorporates the adjectival element:

       i. baleei      san-r-i
           banana clean-reach-PFV
           ‘the banana is ripe’As discussed in section 3.5.1, the grammatical category of adjectives is closed; it
contains only six items. The set of stative verbs is much larger, as shown in section
3.4.4.8. Therefore most NPs that contain an attributive modifier are ambiguous.
Structures that consist of a single noun and a stative verb may be interpreted non-
predicatively as an NP or predicatively consisting of a stative verb combined with a
single argument realized as a bare NP. This ambiguity is illustrated in (77). The
structure consisting of the noun ama ‘person’ and the stative verb tukoi ‘be strong’ is
ambiguous and can be interpreted either as an NP (a) or as N + VP (b).(77)   a. ama         tukoi                           b. ama         tukoi
           person be.strong                               person be.strong
           ‘strong person’                                ‘the person is strong’Structures similar to those in (77) are disambiguated when another NP-domain
constituent is present. This is illustrated in (78), where the numeral nuku ‘one’ follows
the stative verb bui ‘be short’. In Abui, numerals may not modify verbs and therefore
the structure in (b) is identified as an NP. Another constituent that occurs exclusively in
NP domain is the plural quantifier loku (PL). In (d), its presence identifies the given
structure as an NP.(78)   a. lui         bui                             b. lui         bui          nuku

           ‘first wife’ or ‘the woman is eldest’          ‘the first wives’As illustrated in (78), the quantifiers nuku ‘one’ and loku (PL) follow the stative verb.
More details about the NP syntax dealing with more than one modifier can be found in
section 4.4.5.
        There are cases, where an NP containing a stative verb seems lexicalized. In
(79), the head noun ama ‘person’ combines with a stative verb. The noun ama ‘person’

may occur independently referring to an unspecified human being. The noun ama
‘person’ combines with the stative verb kang ‘be good’ to refer neutrally to a human
being, as also illustrated in (80). The stative verb kang ‘be good’ can be alternated with
the stative verb beka ‘be bad’, but in that case, the NP has a negative connotation of a
‘bad guy’.(79)    ama         kang                                  ama       beka

        ‘person, guy’                                     ‘bad guy, villain’The NP ama kang ‘person, guy’ seems lexicalized. It is typically used to refer to
inhabitants of a village or area. Note that area is referred to as a possessor of the noun
ama ‘person’ with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL).","[179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"

indicates the location of ‘telling a story’ as proximate to ‘laughing’. This construction is
uttered as an instruction how to tell a story that is going to be recorded. The speaker
chooses the perspective of the addressee, as he is not participating in the event.(247) kal           a     ananra to,              a-lal          he!

"  6.4.3.1     Anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX)
The anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) indicates the temporal location of an event as
proximate to the moment of speech when it is the final constituent of a sentence, such
as in (234). The demonstrative do (PRX) combines with the verb -yei ‘fall’ to indicate
that the event of ‘falling’ just occurred.(234) da-kur             ba     aka=ng      ha-yei         do

location in time, as illustrated in (235). The speaker complains that his arm hurts.
Because of it he will not be able to shoot with the bow.

the discourse location of the event. This is illustrated in (236) where the demonstrative
do (PRX) follows the clause di ning ayoku ‘they are two’. The demonstrative do (PRX)
seems to mark the first clause as background information for the second clause. It is
followed by an intonational pause, marked in the example with a comma.(236) [luka-luka ya           yoikoi     di ning             ayoku    do,]clause

       ‘monkey and turtle, they were just two of them, they told to each other’ [B06.044.01:48]In (237), two instances of do (PRX) are given. In (a), the anaphoric demonstrative do
(PRX) locates the event of ‘singing’ expressed by the first clause as being proximate to
‘weeding’. It is a type of a ‘when’ clause that presents the background information for
the event expressed in the second clause. In (b), its function is analogous. It indicates
that the event of ‘whirlwinds being bad’ co-occurs with the ‘continuous rain’. The
anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) has a nominalising effect on the clause presenting is
as background information for the event described in the second clause. In fact, the
first phrase is ambiguous and may be also interpreted as an NP because anaphoric
demonstratives also occur as final constituents in NPs.(237) a. [di     yai panen            do,]clause [do-baloka ber-i-a]clause

argument of the verb luuk ‘dance’ is not accessible for the reference of the free
pronoun di (3A) in the second clause. This example illustrates that there are no pivots
for cross-clause coreference in Abui. In this fragment of the Fuluk Munuma narrative,
the free pronoun di (3A) refers to a young man and woman who chew their betel nut
while other people are dancing.

      ‘while people were dancing, the two were eating their betel nut’         [B02.087.08:17]Anaphoric demonstratives may occur in clauses which express paratactic complements,
as in (239), where the first clause expresses one of the arguments of the verb fal
‘separate’ in the second clause.(239) [di nala         nee do,]CC [nu-fal                           naha]clause

      ‘he ate without us’, lit.: ‘given that he ate something, he did not separate for us’The anaphoric demonstratives typically occur as final constituent in complement
clauses such as in (240). It has a nominalising effect on the complement clause which
may be analyzed as a nominal, because it expresses the U argument of the verb ng ‘see’.
The verb ng ‘see’ combines with the verb we ‘leave’ in allative serial verb construction
(see 8.4.2.1). Note, that there is no specialized complementizer in Abui, but the
complement clauses occur in syntactic position of an argument and often combine with
anaphoric demonstratives that seem to serve as nominalizing devices.(240) pulang [na-pong             pe      do]CC=ng            we-i

the locational verb hanah-a ‘put between’ is used in a ULOC-UREC transitive
construction (see 6.2.3.6) expressing the complement of the verb ng ‘see’ which
combines with the verb we ‘leave’ in allative serial verb construction. Observe that the
free pronoun di (3I) precedes the complement.(241) he’e, di [he-to-hanah-a                               do]CC=ng            we

function. As illustrated in the following fragment from the narrative moku ayoku, the
information presented in one clause chain is resumed in the initial part of the next
clause chain and marked as background information with an anaphoric demonstrative.
The direct speech given in (242) is resumed in the first clause of (243) and marked with
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) as background information. The clause ya si-a
‘fetch water’ serves as a complement clause (CC) of the verb generic n ‘see’ that
combines with the verb we ‘leave’ in a purpose serial verb constriction (see 8.4.2.1).

linkage is a typical feature of many Papuan languages (cf. De Vries, 2005).","[306, 307, 308, 309]"
"SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS. The second type of multiple-verb constructions are serial
verb constructions (SVCs). Two serial verb constructions are given in (17).

portion of Abui SVCs consists of more than two verbs as in (b). Different meaning
components of the verbs conjoined in a SVC can be activated. This is illustrated by the
verb me ‘come’ in (18) that has two grammatical functions here. In (a) me ‘come’
encodes direction towards the deictic centre (DC), while in (b) it describes the ‘gradual’
manner of somebody becoming ill.(18)   a. di tur-i                ya    mi    me            b. di me     ha-rik-i

            ‘she scooped up and brought it (towards DC)       ‘he got gradually ill’I distinguish between two types of SVCs according to their compositional properties:
symmetrical and asymmetrical SVCs. SVCs in which the verbs have ‘equal’ grammatical
status and are not restricted to a limited set are symmetrical. The verbs in symmetrical
SVCs encode the reported event in a step by step fashion by listing the verbs as in (19):(19)   fe     mi     me     feng!
       pig take come injure
       ‘slaughter the pig here!’                                               [B10.014.08]        Asymmetrical SVCs consist of a ‘minor verb’ from a restricted set and a ‘major
verb’ from an unrestricted set. Minor verbs are grammaticalized to express different
grammatical functions. Major verbs express the event, functioning as the semantic
‘head’ of an asymmetrical SVC. As illustrated in (18), the minor verb me ‘come’ may
precede or follow the major verb. When the minor verb follows the major verb, its
grammatical functions relate to the right edge of the clause. These functions include
aspect, direction, manner and mood. In (20), the verb me ‘come’ is serialized with the
verb pe ‘be near’ that indicates the aspect.(20)   nu-tafuda          he-n               me    pe

These functions relate to the left edge of the clause such as complements, event
location, participant oriented manner and mood which is illustrated in (21), where the
verb l ‘give’ introduces the malefactive of ‘injuring’ or ‘murdering’ expressed by the
verb feng ‘injure’.

           1.8     Fieldwork and language informants
The data for this grammar was collected during fieldwork in Alor between 2003 and
2005. In 2003, I stayed in the field for seven months. The first two weeks I spent in
Kalabahi. Initially, I worked on the Fanating dialect. After two weeks I moved to the
village of Takalelang where I stayed with the family of Mr. Timoteus Lanma. Takalelang
became my main fieldwork site from which I made several trips to Tifol Afeng, a
nearby hamlet in the surrounding mountains. In 2004, I spent five months in Alor,
mainly in Takalelang. I made a few trips to Tifol Afeng and also spent almost a week in
Mainang. During the year I participated in the teaching program of the Artha Wacana
University branch in Kalabahi and had an opportunity to work with Abui speakers
from Mataru. In July 2004, I co-organized a workshop on the orthography of local
languages. Participants were teachers and language consultants. 8 In 2005, I spent in
total two months in Takalelang and Tifolafeng.
        In Table 5, I list Abui speakers with whom I worked. Whenever possible, I give
their ages and the languages they speak. In the right-hand column the name of the
village/dialect is given. Note that I make a distinction between Malay and Indonesian;
Alor Malay is a distinct variety of Malay, quite different from standard Indonesian
(Baird et.al. 2006). Older people that I worked with often only spoke Malay, not
Indonesian.","[41, 42, 43]"
"
8.1.2     Composition and semantics of SVCs
Abui serial verb constructions are divided into two types according to their
compositional and semantic properties. The SVCs of the first type consist of verbs
belonging to unrestricted set (see 8.2). These verbs are of equal grammatical status; they
do not show any dependency with respect to each other. This means that none of the
verbs in the first type of SVC is semantically ‘dominant’. As illustrated in (10) a number
of verbs combine refer to a single event. The ordering of verbs is conventionalized; it
reflects the established conventions about how things are done in Abui community:(10)    yaa mit         nate-a           tanga      ananra                    ‘negotiate’
        go     sit      stand.up-DUR     speak      tell
        yaa mit nate-a                 tanga ananra tikak             fak     ‘negotiate about peace’
        go     sit    stand.up-DUR     speak tell          arrow      break
        mi     me       feng                                                  ‘bring to slaughter’
        take come injure        In Abui, the SVCs of the second type consist of restricted verb(s) combined
with unrestricted verb(s). The unrestricted verb is semantically ‘dominant’ as it
expresses the event. The restricted verb is semantically ‘dependent’ verb of the
structure in the sense that is has a grammatical function(s) rather than referring to an
event. The restricted verbs will be referred to as ‘minor’ verbs. The unrestricted verbs
will be referred to as ‘major verbs’. Aikhenvald (2006) refers to these two types of SVCs
352                                       CHAPTER VIII
with the terms SYMMETRICAL and ASYMMETRICAL respectively. In my description of Abui, I
adopt these terms systematically.
         In Abui asymmetrical SVCs, the minor verb either precedes or follows the
major verb, distinguishing two subtypes of asymmetrical SVCs (ASVC). This is
illustrated in as illustrated in (11). In the first column, the minor verb l ‘give’ precedes a
number of major verbs. The verb l ‘give’ has a grammatical function of expressing
benefactive (human) participants (for examples see 8.4.2.4). The verb kanri ‘finish’ is
the minor verb in the second column. It serves to express that an event has been
completed (for more examples see 8.3.1.1). Note that for the ease of presenting the full
glosses are omitted:       MINOR MAJOR                                       MAJOR    MINOR
(11)   -l       takei    ‘bite s.o.’                     nee      kanri    ‘finish eating’
       give     bite                                     eat      finish
       -l       tahai     ‘search s.o.’                  yaar     kanri    ‘finish going’
       give     search                                   go.CPL   finish
       -l       feng     ‘injure, murder s.o.’           feng     kanri    ‘kill’
       give     injure                                   injure   finish
       -l       luk      ‘massage s.o.’                  mar      kanri    ‘finish cooking’
       give     rub                                      cook     finishIn an ASVC, ordering of the major and minor verbs is grammaticalized. Therefore a
distinction will be made between ASVC.I and ASVC.II. In ASVC.I the minor verb(s) follow
the major verb(s). As discussed in 8.3, the minor verbs in ASVC.I express something
about the event properties such as aspect, manner, direction of the event, or mood.
        In ASVC.II the minor verb(s) precede the major verb(s). The function of the
minor verb is to express the participants or describe event settings, as will be discussed
in 8.4. The position of the minor verb with respect to the position of the major verb
corresponds to the positions of aspectual markers, arguments and adverbs within Abui
clause. In a monoverbal clause, arguments and adverbs referring to the settings of the
event precede the verb. The aspectual markers and negation always follow (for details
see 6.4.1).
        In Abui, there is a number of SVCs that display properties of both types. In
these SVCs, a number of verbs of ‘equal’ status combine with one or more major verbs.
These SVCs usually occur in narrative texts. The intonational properties of the SVC
complex are those of a monoverbal clause; the complex also is under scope of negation.
Such SVCs must be treated as ‘hybrid’ SVCs because they do not fit in the dichotomy
symmetrical vs. asymmetrical but have properties of both types. An example of a
‘hybrid’ SVC is given in (12). The verbs top ‘drop’ and taha ‘put on’ combine in an
ASVC.II. Both verbs share their arguments tut ‘shore’ co-indexed with the LOC prefix on
topi ‘drop’. They share the argument kapal loku ‘boats’ co-indexed with the distributive

prefix on topi ‘drop’ with the first verb marang ‘come up’. The verbs marang ‘come
up’ and top ‘drop’ combine in a symmetrical SVC:(12)    kapal loku o             marang         tut       tah-a
        boat     PL      MD      come.up.ICP shore        put.on.CPL-DUR

        ‘the boats disembarked on the shore’                                            [B05.029.01]Hybrid SVCs do not have a specific grammatical function. They seem to be ad-hoc
formed constructions depending on the pragmatic decisions of the speaker. Therefore I
will not report ‘hybrid’ SVCs in a separate section. Instead, I will point them out in
various sections.
        Finally, there is a final remark to be made about the correlation between the
shared aspectual inflection and the compositional properties of a SVC. The verbs
combined in asymmetric SVCs share always their aspectual inflection. The inflection
appears on the final verb of a SVC regardless its ‘status’, hence, in ASVC.I, aspectual
inflection is attached to the minor verb, and in ASVC.II, aspectual inflection is attached
to the major verb. However, in symmetrical SVCs and hybrid SVCs the aspectual
inflections do not necessarily have to be shared by all verbs.","[374, 375, 376]"
"16The anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC) is the grammaticalized index verb stem nu ‘be.like.PRF’. This stem is
possibly a homogeneous complex verb that is derived from the generic roots n ‘see’ and u ‘leave’ indicating
that the specific referent has been ‘seen’ previously.

discourse location of referents. As the referents occurred in the shared discourse
previously, they may be considered as definite.(130) a. kaai o                                       b. kaai yo

The medial anaphoric demonstrative indicates that the canoe occurred in the discourse
earlier, the speaker assumes that the addressee is able to identify the canoe.(131) pelang o            tut      tah-a                it-i

(131). It refers to a previously mentioned referent that is known to both speech
participants. As illustrated in (132) an NP is linked with the linker ba (LNK) to the
adverb el ‘before’ that is followed by the anaphoric demonstrative lo (MD). The
construction is an answer to the question ‘what are you roasting there?’ The speaker
says that the fish was actually a bit ‘smelly’ and explains ‘so that is why I am roasting it’.(132) [afu]NP ba       {el     lo} he-amaling fa                        kabei ho-pa

4.5. In (133), the use of the anaphoric demonstrative yo (MD.AD) is illustrated. It
presents the information as medial (less proximate) from the point of view of the
addressee (a) and serves to draw his attention. In (b), the speaker uses yo (MD.AD) to
present new information in a way as if the addressee is actually aware of it.(133) a. karong      yo        tirei=si        taka         kang

116                                      CHAPTER III
In (134), yo (MD.AD) occurs as the final element of a relative clause linked to the NP
kaai ‘dog’ with the linker ba (LNK). The speaker refers to addressee’s knowledge of the
‘dog that died’ and informs what happened to it. To mark this contrast the NP is
combined with the anaphoric demonstrative yo (MD.AD) that indicates that the referent
is medial (less proximate) in discourse with respect to the addressee.(134) [kaai]NP ba         {mon-i       yo}RC he-adua               mi ba           ul     ì

      ‘that dog (you talked about before) that died, his owner took it and buried’ [B05.047.04]There are two demonstratives hu (SPC) and nu (SPC.AD) that are restricted to the
anaphoric function. They do not have a deictic use and never precede the head noun, as
illustrated in (135).(135) a. fala       nu                                 b. *nu          fala

            ‘a house (you do not know about)’Both forms indicate that the referent is ‘referential’ in the sense that is it ‘accessible’
within the discourse. The anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) contrasts with the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD) that indicates a referent ‘specific’ only for the
speaker. That means that the referent is located only in speaker’s own ‘discourse’ and is
not shared with the addressee. In (136), a fragment of a narrative is presented. A man
ate some of the fragrant betel nut that belonged to his wife and gives this as an
explanation to a giant snake, from which he tries to steal some betel nuts.(136) ne-mayol          he-fu                 hu       na      takei

discourse and its anaphoricity is questionable. I consider it as anaphoric only within the
discourse of the speaker. It encodes the subtle referential distinction that the presented
referent is only new for the addressee but specific for the speaker. In (137), the use of
the anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) is illustrated. Consider the conversation fragment
where one participant inquires whether addressee’s wife cooks meat. The answer is that
‘some fish’ is being cooked. The NP afu hu ‘some fish’ refers to a ‘fish’ that is only in
discourse of the speaker in A, and thus specific; however, it is not shared with the
speaker in Q for who the information is new.

for both speaker and addressee. In that sense, it may be considered as definite. This is
illustrated in (138), where the head noun fu ‘betel nut’ is modified with the anaphoric
demonstrative nu (SPC). The demonstrative indicates that both speech participants can
identify the betel nut.(138) fu        nu       pi      takai

contrasted. In the NP given in (a), the anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD) combines
with the head bataa ‘wood’ that is preceded by the deictic demonstrative oro (DST). The
NP refers to a specific tree, visible for both speech participants. In (b), the anaphoric
demonstrative hu (SPC) combines with the question word nala ‘what’. In questions, the
anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) is found frequently. It indicates that the questioned
referent is new in the shared context.(139) a. oro bataa nu              ho-ng                mara!

the verb taa ‘lie’ marking the end of an embedded clause. The anaphoric demonstrative
has a nominalizing effect on the VP di taa ‘he lies’. It expresses that the temporal
location of the event of ‘lying’ as proximate to the event of ‘not lying on a mat’.(140) [di taa] do            adik tai             taa naha

(141). The anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) follows the verb rik ‘hurt’. It marks the
information ‘the pig is ill’ as new for the addressee.

combine with VPs to specify the temporal location of an event with respect to
discourse, introduce background information and other functions. Polysemy of
demonstrative elements is also attested in other Papuan languages (cf. Reesink, 1994).

"       7.4     Summary of the semantic contribution of generic roots
As demonstrated in the sections above, the homogeneous CVs frequently encode
locomotion and motion events. They offer an interesting look in the event
decomposition of the motion and locomotion events in Abui. The structure of these
events is schematically represented in (137) and compared with the structure of the
heterogeneous CVs.

When Abui speakers translate the meaning of a complex verb, they often use hand
gestures that express the locus and indicate the trajectory of the event (for instance the
                                      COMPLEX VERBS                                      345
verb d ‘hold’ is illustrated by putting one hand on the top of an object, or just on the
table, the verb t ‘lie’ is illustrated by putting both hands on each other, etc.). They often
find it difficult to translate an Abui verb with a Malay equivalent unable to capture the
polysemy of Abui verbs. Systematic research into this use of gesture could provide
additional insights in the type of event decompositions suggested in this chapter.
             8 Serial Verb Constructions
In general, Abui speakers use more verbs to refer to simple events than English
speakers. In (1) the expressed events of ‘taking back’ and ‘bringing back’ are spelled out
in serial verb constructions that describe the event components in step by step fashion.1(1)      a. ha-wai            mi-a!                       b. na mi            ha-wai           miei

             ‘take it back!’                                    ‘I brought it back’Serial verb constructions (SVCs) are often thought of as verb clusters without any over
marker of coordination or subordination. Foley and Olson (1985) argue that the verbs
in SVCs behave as a single predicate in a simple clause with respect to grammatical
operators such as negation or aspectual inflection. As illustrated in (1), Abui SVCs
consist minimally of two verbs (a), but often more verbs are serialized (b). In a SVC,
different meaning components of the verbs may be activated (cf. Crowley, 2002:22-3).
This is illustrated (2). The verb me ‘come’ encodes direction in (a), while in (b) it
encodes manner and perhaps some aspect (gradual change).(2)      a. di tur-i                   ya      mi      me            b. di me            ha-rik-i

             ‘she scooped up and brought it (towards DC)                   ‘he got gradually ill’In view of this Abui SVCs should not be dealt with as a single construction, but rather
as a collection of constructions sharing the same set of conceptual, grammatical,
morpho-syntactic and semantic properties (cf. Crowley 2002:1-23).
        In section 8.1, I give grammatical, compositional and semantic characteristics of
Abui SVCs. Compositional characteristics of SVCs are taken as the main criterion in
describing Abui SVCs (8.1.2). They are described as symmetrical or asymmetrical,
following the dichotomy established by Aikhenvald (2006). In section 8.2, I describe
symmetrical SVCs in which the verbs have ‘equal’ grammatical status. The verbs in
symmetrical SVCs encode the reported event in a step by step fashion by listing the
verbs.
        The asymmetrical SVCs consist of a two verbs of ‘unequal’ grammatical status.
The ‘minor verb’ has a grammatical function as the verb me ‘come’ in (2). The ‘major
verb’ is the semantic head of the SVC. I distinguish two types of asymmetrical SVCs
taking the syntactic position of the ‘minor’ verb as the formal criterion. In section 8.3, I
describe asymmetrical SVCs in which the minor verb follows the major verb. The
minor verb expresses aspect, direction, manner and mood.","[366, 367, 368, 369, 370]"

   8.4.4.1     SVC with ma ‘be.PRX’
The speaker-proximate event location is expressed with the minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’. An
example is given in (168) where the minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ combines with the verb yei
‘fall’ sharing a single argument. It refers to the location near the speaker where the
referred object ‘fell’:(168) di      ma         ha-yei?
      3A      be.PRX 3II.PAT-fall
      ‘did it fall here (by me)?’                                         [B05.083.02]Although both verbs in (168) have each their own argument, both pronouns expressing
the arguments have the same reference. The free pronoun di (3A) is the A argument of
the deictic verb ma ‘be.PRX’ while the PAT prefix ha- is the U argument of the verb yei
‘fall’. The minor verb in (168) expresses an event location while in (169) it expresses
potential modality. The minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ expresses an attitude of the speaker
towards the event expressed by the major verb. The major verb is inflected for aspect
with imperfective suffix -e (IPFV).(169) di      ma         do-làk-e
      3A      be.PRX     3I.REC-leave.for-IPFV

  8.4.4.2       SVC with ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
The minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ encodes the addressee-proximate location of the event.
This is illustrated in example (170) analogous to previous (168) where the minor verb ta
‘be.PRX.AD’ combines with the verb -yei ‘fall’ sharing a single argument:(170) di     ta           ha-yei?
      3A     be.PRX.AD 3II.PAT-fall
      ‘did he fall near you?’                                             [B05.083.02]In (171) both proximal deictic verbs are contrasted in the same SVC. Note that the
minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ used in a question presupposes the same location of the
speaker with the addressee as illustrated in (a). However, the minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
refers simply to the location of the addressee, regardless the location of speaker.
Logically the speaker is located elsewhere than the addressee in such situation because
otherwise the verb ma ‘be.PRX’ would be used:(171) a. anui ma              o-pa=ng                    sei?

   8.4.4.3     SVC with la ‘be.MD’
The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ expresses a medial (less proximate) event location with
respect to the speaker. The construction is used in situations when the speech
participants talk about events occurring in other locations that are distant from them.
This is illustrated in (100) where the speaker inquires whether the addressee is going to
stay over night in the harbour town encoded as la ‘be.MD’ or come back to the village
where they are both located at that time:(172) a       la        taa re a-wai?
      2SG be.MD lie            or 2SG.PAT-turn
      ‘will you sleep there or come back?’                                       [B04.009.02]In example (173) the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used in a very complex utterance that
uses a number of SVCs. Ignoring the first two clauses, in the third clause the minor
verb la ‘be.MD’ combines with the major verb yaari ‘go’, together with the other two
minor verbs pa ‘touch’ and ng ‘see’ expressing the motion towards a proximate
recipient. The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used to stress that the location where the
speaker ‘arrived’ is actually distant from his location at the moment of speech:(173) di       he-n          de-l          binen-r-i        ba      me     mai   se    na

       ‘he was getting ready for it to come when I arrived to him there’         [B07.037.03]The location verb SVC with the verb la ‘be.MD’ has a functional extension expressing
modality. It expresses speaker’s opinion that the event expressed with the major verb
happens ‘autonomously’ according its own will. The event is presented as ‘distant’ from
the speaker as illustrated in (174). The addressee is expressed as the A argument of the
minor verb la ‘be.MD’ and major verbs we ‘leave’ and me ‘come’. The speaker expresses
his lack of understanding why the addressee just keeps walking around:(174) a      la       we la           me do, a              nala tahai?
      2SG be.MD leave be.MD come PRX 2SG what search
      ‘you, you only go and come, so what are you searching?’                    [B05.033.03]In fact the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ indicates that the reported event is performed outside
the deictic centre, and ‘autonomously’ of speaker’s intention and awareness of its
reason; however, this construction can be analyzed as realis marking strategy as it
confirms that the event is truly happening. This is illustrated in (175) where (A) inquires
whether (B) is already asleep. (B) uses la ‘be.MD’ to express that he is unable to sleep.
He says that he is just lying ‘there’, while he is in the same location with the speaker.

takes place ‘autonomously’ of speaker’s expectation. In (176) the minor verb la ‘be.MD’
combines with yei ‘fall’ sharing a single argument wata ‘coconut’.(176) wata       la         ha-yei
      coconut be.MD 3II.PAT-fall
      ‘the coconut fell suddenly’                                                      [B07.073.01]
   8.4.4.4   SVC with fa ‘be.MD.AD’
The minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ refers to an event location distant from the addressee.
The use of fa implicates realis mode as it marks ‘truly’ occurring events. As realis mode
marker it has also contrastive epistemic function identifying that the information is
either new or unknown to the addressee. The verb fa corresponds roughly in its use to
English ‘actually’. In (101) it is contrasted with two other deictic verbs ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
and la ‘be.MD’ combined in all cases with the major verb sei ‘come down’:(177) a. anui ta                 sei?                      b. anui la            sei

of a questioned car. Note that the deictic verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ corresponds in usage to the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD).","[426, 427, 428, 429]"

3.5.7    Question words
The last closed grammatical category contains question words. In Abui, question words
are forms such as nala ‘what’, maa ‘who’, te ‘where, how’, teina ‘when’ and yeng ‘how
much’. These forms always remain ‘in situ’; i.e. in the syntactic position of the
questioned constituent. The question word nala ‘what’ is used as default question word
referring to non-human entities. In (176), nala ‘what’ occurs in two different syntactic
positions. In (a), it occurs clause finally, questioning the identity of the referred object.
In (b), it occurs in the position of the U argument, questioning the complement of ong
‘make’.(176) a. {it        do}clause nala?              b. a         nala    ong?

         ‘what is this (lying here)?’                 ‘what are you doing/making?’The question word nala may be used to question the species or kind of an entity. This
is illustrated in (177). In (a), the kind of a tree is questioned. In (b), the name of a place
is asked in a construction that involves a relative clause:(177) a. it     do      nala bataa?
         lie.on PRX what tree
         ‘what (kind of ) tree is this?’                                       [Note.007.01]

Although both constructions have identical word orders, they are differentiated by their
intonational contour. In (176)-(177) nala ‘what’ is used in interrogative constructions.
In (178), the form nala is used to refer to non-specific entities and is translated as
‘something’. In both cases, the form nala expresses a non-specific U argument of the
verbs nee ‘eat’ and lakda ‘read’:

used to refer to animates. This is illustrated in (179). In (a), the speaker assumes a non-
human actor that caused a bite. In (b), the speaker assumes that the bite is caused by a
human.(179) a. nala e-l          takei?                     b. maa e-l                    takei?

However, the question nala ‘what’ can be used as well. This is illustrated in (180):(180) a. a-ne               nala?                b. a-ne                  maa?

the question word te ‘where’ is found in the position of the questioned constituent (in

‘be in’:(181) a. fe te          mi-a                   b. a        te        he-mi-a                 taa

direction of a motion is questioned. An example is given in (182), where the form
te=ng combines with the verb yaar ‘go’.(182) ma          e-d-o,             a te=ng      yaar-i?

the speaker expresses that somebody left for no matter where.

21 The question word teina ‘when’ is possibly derived. It could be historically derived from the combination oftwo verb stems te-i ‘put where’ and the index verb stem na ‘be like this’ that compose the notion of ‘when’ a
question about the temporal location of an event that is identical to the event described in the second clause.

example is given in (179) where the verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ combines with rul ‘take off’:(179) di      fa              de-namang ha-rul                 ba      ko    da-wel

   8.4.4.5    SVC with ya ‘be.DST’
The minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ expresses an event location distal from both speech
participants. Its use is illustrated in (180) where the minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ combines
with the verb -iel ‘roast’. In (a) the speaker is located outside the shelter where he is
roasting a fish for the addressee. In such context, he is marked ‘distal’ from the event
location. In (b) the minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ is used because the speaker is roasting a
fish for the addressee inside the shelter, while the addressee is outside:(180) a. na      ya         e-afu          walanga-i         h-iel

evidential function marking the event as non-witnessed by the speaker but as one that
really happened expressing in fact realis mode. This is illustrated in the narrative
fragment in (181):(181) he-maama         do      wan       ya        do-beka

time from the moment of speech.","[429, 430]"
"8.1           Characteristics of Abui Serial Verb Constructions
SVCs are defined as constructions expressing what is conceptualized as a single event2
(Durie 1997:291) sharing a number of grammatical as well as semantic characteristics
that were established cross-linguistically (Foley and Olson, 1985; Durie, 1997; Pawley
and Lane, 1998; Aikhenvald and Dixon, 2006). For grammatical characteristics, they
include:(3)      i.    SVCs are monoclausal units with two or more verbs conjoined without any
               conjunction;         ii. SVCs are contiguous constructions as no constituents except arguments may
             intervene between the verbs;         iii. SVCs have intonational properties of a mono-verbal clause (Givón, 1990);         iv. verbs in SVCs may share their inflections, especially for aspect;         v. verbs in SVCs share negation;         vi. verbs in SVCs share at least one argument.",[371]
"  6.4.3.2     Anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD)
The anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) used as final constituent of a sentence
indicates the proximate temporal location of the referred event with respect to the
addressee. This means that the speaker presents new information to the addressee as if
he already knows about it. An example is given in (245). This is a fragment from the
narrative moku ayoku which is a story of two orphans. A part of the story was given in
(242)-(244). Here a blind woman is cheated by another woman. Her baby is stolen and
she is presented a banana blossom and blamed as a witch that cannot bear proper
human beings. When the husband returns home and asks about the baby that was born
while he was away, the blind woman gives him the following answer:(245) baleei wataka          hu na        ha-yar                 to
      banana blossom SPC 1SG 3II.PAT-give.birth.CPL              PRX.AD

In the previous example, the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) referred to an event
that occurred in the past. In (246), the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) refers to an
event that is about to occur. The completive stem of the verb aisa/aisi ‘urinate’ does
not indicate the past but expresses the event of ‘peeing’ is viewed as having a final
point.","[309, 310]"
"  3.4.5.3     Deictic verbs
Deictic verbs point to locations. There are five monosylabic deictic stems that are
identified as verbs, because they may combine with aspectual inflection. The aspectual
suffix -i (PFV) identifies the form ma ‘be.PRX’ in (98) as a verb. The verb ma ‘be.PRX’
                                GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                          103
occurs in serial verb construction with the verb -rik ‘hurt, be ill’. It indicates that the
event expressed by the verb -rik ‘hurt, be ill’ indeed occurred. It is followed by an
intonational break marked here with a comma. Together with the first clause it serves
as a complement of the verb uk-d-a and it is co-indexed with the LOC prefix he-
(3II.LOC).(98)   {a      pet   ha-fik-e}clause       ya     {a-rik         ma-i, }clause {no-mi

       3II.LOC-withdraw-hold-DUR
       ‘it surprises me that you are pulling the bow and (it) already hurts you’ [B09.004.04:03]However, deictic verbs mostly occur in serial verb constructions, and only in few cases
they are inflected for aspect or person. This makes them very adverb-like elements, also
due to their semantics.
        The deictic verbs point to locations with respect to the speech participants. In
this respect, they are closely related to demonstratives discussed in 3.5.2. The reference
points anchoring the deictic centre are located in speech participants. For SPEAKER
BASED DEICTIC VERBS, as the name suggests, the reference point of the deictic centre is
based at the speaker. For ADDRESSEE BASED DEICTIC VERBS, the reference point of the
deictic centre is based at the addressee. Once the deictic centre is established a three-
way distinction can be made along the contrast PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL. For the
distal locations, the distinction between the speaker based and addressee based deictic
verbs is not relevant. An overview of the deictic verbs is given in (99):             SPEAKER-BASED                             ADDRESSEE-BASED

       e. ya
             be.DST
             ‘be far from me/you/DC’The deictic verbs ma ‘be.PRX’ and ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ in (99) express proximity to the deictic
centre, located at one of the speech participants. Both verbs can be translated as ‘be
here’ but the interpretation of ‘here’ depends on the location of the deictic centre at the
speaker or at the addressee. The deictic verbs la ‘be.MD’ and fa ‘be.MD.AD’ express a
medial distance from the deictic centre, located at the speaker or addressee. The deictic
verb ya ‘be.DST’ expresses remoteness and distance from the deictic centre.
        Deictic verbs always occur in intransitive constructions. In most cases, they
combine with other verbs in serial verb constructions. They serve as minor verbs
expressing the location (or modality) of the referred event. This is illustrated in (100), in
104                                       CHAPTER III
a situation where the speaker inquires whether the addressee intends to stay the night in
the harbour or come back to the village. The verb la ‘be.MD’ refers to the location of
‘sleeping’, which is in the ‘harbour’, that is less proximate to the speech participants at
the moment of speaking.(100) a       la        taa re a-wai?

a similar serial construction. Each of the deictic verbs is serialized with the verb sei
‘come down’. It indicates the position of the speech participant:(101) a. anui ta                 sei?                       b. anui la       sei

18 This view was adopted by Stokhof (1981:127) who argues for the pronominal status of the forms like ne-do(1SG.EMPH) and identifies the -do following Capell (1975) as a ‘defining marker’ that ‘plays a role in
prominence organization of the utterance’. Stokhof distinguishes the -do pronominal forms like ne-do from -de
pronouns such as ne-de.

        Generic verb m may serve as a minor verb in SVCs encoding two grammatical
functions: (i) In instrumental SVCs it expresses the instrument participant as its U
argument; the human A argument is shared. It is glossed as ‘take’. (ii) In interior
location SVCs it expresses either the interior of objects such as ‘house’ or the interior
‘location’ of animates where cognitive and emotional processes take place, similar to
English ‘heart’ or Indonesian/Malay hati ‘liver’. In these constructions the verbal form
m ‘be in’ is nominalized as it serves often expresses a complement of the major verb.19
        The generic verb m ‘take, be in’ is not a proper prosodic word. Therefore it
mostly combines with the generic verb ì ‘put’ in a completive stem in both SVCs. The
completive stem mi ‘take, be in’ is possibly related to the deictic verb ma ‘be.PRX’
discussed in 8.4.4.1 and me ‘come’ (see 8.3.2.3, 8.4.6.2). In the following paragraphs
both functions of the minor verb mi ‘take, be in’ are discussed.
        INSTRUMENTAL SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The minor verb mi ‘take’ serves to
express the instrument, typically combining with two arguments. The A argument is
shared with the major verb, while the U argument expresses the instrument. An
example of an instrumental SVC is given in (122):(122) ama      kawen      mi bataa                    tukong
      person machete take wood                        cut
      ‘one cuts wood with a machete’The minor verb mi ‘take’ shares its A argument ama ‘person’ with tukong ‘cut’. Both
verbs have each their own U argument; mi ‘take’ combines with the U argument kawen
‘machete’, tukong ‘cut’ combines with bataa ‘wood’. The instrumental SVC is used as
valence-increasing device as the transitive mi adds the third argument to the
construction.
        The form mi has been grammaticalized on clausal level to a conjunction marker
establishing ‘instrument-like’ relationship between two clauses. In (123), the first clause
serves as a complement expressing the ‘instrument’ which caused the plate to be
broken. Note the form mi ‘take’ also occurs in instrumental SVC with the verb batek
‘throw, hit’. The U argument of the verb mi ‘take’ is da-táng ‘his arm’, the A argument
di (3A) is shared with the major verb.(123) [neng nuku di da-táng               mi                lik        tah-a=ng                 batek]CC

19 Cognate verbs in other TAP languages express similar grammatical functions: in Adang there is a locativeverb mi ‘be at’ (cf. Haan; 2001);in Blagar mi is a locative postposition (Steinhauer, 1991:215), there is also an
inalienable noun -omi ‘inside’ (Steinhauer, 1991:215); in Kabola, there is a prefix mi that can attach to verbs to
derive applicative verbs (Stokhof, 1987:635), and a locative marker mi ‘be in’, however, this form displays
some verbal properties as it may combine with aspectual markers (cf. Stokhof, 1987:641,643); in Kaera, there
is a postposition mi serving as an oblique marker and a transitive verb ming ‘be at location’ (cf. Klamer, to
appear:21); in Klon mi is a verb meaning ‘be at’ or ‘place’ (cf. Baird, to appear:11), and has grammaticalized
uses as applicative marker and a conjunction.

example (124) where the minor verb mi ‘take’ combines with the major verb kaput
‘sew’. Note that the verb mi ‘take’ is also used in the second clause serialized with the
verb r ‘reach’ where the verbs ‘take’ and ‘reach’ refer to a transfer event involving three
participants.(124) [ne-konrek kirek-d-i]            hare, [na mi ne-ura                    he-r-i,]

the other verb. In the second clause, it is expressed with the free pronoun na (1SG). In
the third clause, it is expressed with the free pronoun di (3A) anaphoric to the NP ne-
ura ‘my sister’ The U argument of mi ‘take’ is in both cases the NP ne-konrek ‘my
shirt’ in the first clause. The minor verb ng ‘see’ in the third clause serves to express the
‘purpose’ of taking which is ‘sewing up’. In (125) a similar example is given:(125) yambuk nu           nu-mi             we-a         ba          ni    mi=ng         buuk

‘consume’. Both verbs combine in a symmetrical SVC. The minor verb ng ‘see’
encodes the purpose forming a prosodic word with mi. The verb mi ‘take’ combines
with the U argument yambuk nu ‘some glasses’ expressed in the first clause. The SVC
numi wea ‘we want’ is discussed in detail below.
        INTERIOR LOCATION SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The second function of the minor
verb m ‘be in’ is to express the interior location of either an animate or inanimate
participant. I will first discuss constructions where the verb m ‘be in’ serves to express
interior location of an animate participant. In these constructions, the minor verb m ‘be
in’ combines with two U arguments. The human experiencer participant is realized as
the U argument of the verb m ‘be in’ with the REC prefix. It is typically shared with the
major verb (V2). An example of an interior location SVC is given in (126) where the
minor verb m ‘be in’ combines with the major verb pang ‘feel’ to refer to ‘thinking’ as
‘feeling inside’. The REC prefix o- (2SG.REC) expresses the recipient of the ‘thought’. The
390                                      CHAPTER VIII

location of emotion as ‘heart’. I will address the nominal properties of Abui
constructions with m/mi ‘be in’ further in this section.
       There is a large variety of constructions with mi ‘be in’ that refer to various
emotions and cognitive events. These constructions can be described with a number of
templates. In (127), the template consists of the verb mi ‘be in’ that is serialized with
the major verb describing the emotion or cognitive event. The REC prefix expresses the
experiencer that is optionally expressed with an NP or with a free pronoun. Note that
the major verb may combine with a U argument.","[410, 411, 412, 413]"

3.2.2        Categorial indeterminacy
There are a number of ambiguous lexical items that are identified as nouns or verbs.
The ambiguity is resolved by the syntactic context in which the items occur. Consider
the form luuk in (8).(8)     a. he-luuk              do         he-feela      afenga     wi-d-a

           ‘while people were dancing, the two were eating their betel nut’    [B02.087.08:17]The lexical item luuk in (8) is identified a noun in (a) because it combines with the
possessive prefix and serves as an argument of the verb wida ‘become like that,
resemble’. In (b), the form is identified as a verb because it combines with a single
argument expressed with the noun ama ‘person’. In both cases the form luuk is
followed by the anaphoric demonstrative do that marks the end of a domain. In (a), do
(PRX) marks the end of an NP. In (b), it has a nominalising function, it marks the end of
a clause that serves as background information for the second clause.
        Another ambiguous item is tur, illustrated in (9). Both examples are taken from
a narrative. In (a), the form tur refers to a ‘spoon’ that fell out from the house and
must be picked up again. In (b), the form tur is used as a predicate ‘scoop up’ and
combines with the U argument is fat ma ‘cooked corn’.(9)    a. ah, na        sei               tur       mi=se         yo!

same form yaa is used in (b), where it refers to the activity of ‘going’.(10)   a. na      yaa     foka=ng      ha-fui-d-a

relation between their two meanings in the sense that the noun refers to a U argument
of the verb in a very broad sense. The semantic relations may be described in pairs such
as undergoer/result-activity, instrument-activity, location-activity, and entity-property
(cf. Comrie and Thompson 1985:349)

an NP) or predicatively (as the head of a VP). The same categorial ambiguity is found
also by lexical items that are borrowed from Malay, as illustrated in (15). The two uses
of sakola display the location-activity relationship; tulusa displays the undergoer-
activity relationship:

the syntactic and morphological context, in which they occur. The presented data
suggests that Abui sides with Austronesian languages in categorial indeterminacy and
not with Papuan (cf. Foley, 1998:509, 512; Himmelmann, 2005:126-131), which
normally have a strict division in nominal and verbal categories.1
3.2.3      Distributional properties
At the word level, nouns are characterized as either free or bound roots that may
combine with pronominal prefixes (for an overview of pronominal inventory, see
section 3.3). Pronominal prefixes serve to express possessors (for a detailed discussion
of possession, see section 4.2). Nominal morphology is restricted to the possessor
marking by pronominal prefixes. Other inflections such as for number, case, class, or
gender are not found in Abui.2
        Two free roots combined with pronominal prefixes are given in (16). The
pronominal prefixes belong to set I, glossed as AL(inenable) below. The free root feela
‘friend’ combines with pronominal prefix ne- (1SG.AL). The free root maama ‘father’
combines with pronominal prefix he- (3II.AL):(16)     ne-feela                ‘my friend’                         he-maama           ‘his father’
         1SG.AL-friend                                               3II.AL-fatherBound roots combine with pronominal prefixes from set III, glossed as INAL(ienable)
below. As illustrated in (17), the bound roots –táng ‘hand’ and wei ‘ear’ combine with
pronominal prefixes na- (1SG.INAL) and ha- (3II.INAL) respectively.(17)     na-táng                 ‘my hand’                           ha-wei             ‘his ear’
         1SG.INAL-hand                                               3II.INAL-earThere is a distinction between the nouns in (16) and (17). The nouns in (17) obligatorily
combine with the pronominal prefixes that express a possessor (see section 4.2.2). The
nouns in (16) combine optionally with pronominal prefixes (see section 4.2.3).
       Nouns never combine with pronominal prefixes from set II, glossed as
REC(ipient) below, which may only be attached to verbs. In (18), this restriction1 Categorical indeterminacy is a typical feature of Austronesian languages. As discussed by (Foley, 1998)Austronesian morphology is typified by the roots that ‘exhibit categorical indeterminacy, i.e. a given root can
be used nominally or verbally without derivation by being head of syntactically nominal or verbal
construction’ (Foley, 1998:509). However, ‘the roots in Papuan languages show a sharp division into nominal
and verbal categories and can only change via morphological derivation’ (Foley, 1998:512). Another Papuan
language that shows similar categorical indeterminacy is Sulka. This language has been in long-termed contact
with Austronesian languages (Reesink, 2005:145) which resulted in sharing the typological feature of
indeterminacy with AN languages (Reesink, 2005:163).
2 The lack of case and number inflection of nouns is claimed to be a common feature among other Papuanlanguages (Foley, 1986:93-96) as they rather employ verbal affixation to signal case relations.

disqualifies the ambiguous forms malaida, beka, fing, and kang in (b, d, f, h) to be
interpreted as nouns. The pronominal prefix belonging to set II identifies these lexemes

       1.4    Linguistic situation
Abui is spoken in a linguistically diverse area where Austronesian and Papuan languages
are spoken. The Alor-Pantar area comprises approximately twenty five languages of
which only a number have been studied and documented. Map 2 shows both Papuan
and Austronesian languages spoken in the Alor-Pantar area. The immediate neighbours
of Abui are Kamang, Kui, Hamap, Klon, Kafoa, and Kabola. The map does not
mention Alor Malay, which has an increasing number of speakers in the area. The Abui
community is relatively large (16,000 speakers) compared to other ethnic groups in
Alor-Pantar area. Abui is reported to be the target of language shift in some of its
neighbouring languages such as Kafoa or Hamap (Katubi 2004).
         In the recent past, a large number of settlements (practically all larger villages
such as Takalelang, Fanating, or Mainang) have been moved down from their
mountainous habitat either to the coast or to valleys. As a result of the resettlement,
many settlements are now located near markets, roads, or the sea where they have more
contact with other language communities. These factors stimulate the language shift of
the youngest generation towards Malay. The northern and western settlements such as
Takalelang, Welai, Fanating and Moru are most affected by the shift while small
mountainous settlements are least affected. In Takalelang, most children are brought up
in Malay, though they become more proficient in Abui when they grow up because it is
still the main language used between adults.
         The situation is different in small settlements such as Tifol Afeng, where I
conducted a part of my fieldwork. Here, people are fluent in Malay, but in their daily
lives Abui is the main language and is used in communication with children. Children
remain monolingual in Abui until the age of five or six, the age at which they start
going to school.
         In churches, the situation varies. In Takalelang, the protestant church uses
exclusively Indonesian; the catholic community uses the Indonesian liturgy. Abui is
used in parish council meetings and in worship where the priest is not present, such as
in Rosary worship that takes place in the houses of parish members. The first attempt
to translate the Gospel in Abui has been made by the late Julius Onkari Manimabi. It
resulted in a typescript of the first chapter of the Gospel according to Mark which is
included in the corpus.
         In schools, Abui is banned. Despite official policy stimulating bilingual
education in Indonesia, in Alor education is monolingual and many teachers are
unaware of the official policy. To my knowledge, instruction materials in Abui have not
been made available or developed up to this day.
         In the market, members of various Alorese ethnic groups address each other
using each other’s native terms, which is considered very good manners. Abui speakers
are identified by their pronunciation of the sound [k], which is pronounced as the
uvular stop [q] in word-internal and word-final positions.
                                           INTRODUCTION                                                5
        A number of languages given in Map 2 have been the subject of linguistic study.
These include Adang (Haan, 2001), Blagar (Steinhauer, 1991), Kabola (Stokhof, 1987),

"7.2.6     Heterogeneous complex verbs with functional roots
In Abui, a number of functional roots such as the quantifiers faring ‘much’, kabei
‘little’, or nuk ‘one’ may be incorporated in a CV stem, as illustrated in (61). In all cases,
the functional root combines with the generic root d ‘hold’.(61)    faring-faring-d-          ‘become too much’      nuk-nuk-d-             ‘do one by one’

        kabei-kabei-d-            ‘become very little’
        RED[little]-holdThe use of the CV kabei-kabei-d- is illustrated in (62), where the verb combines with
the A argument di (3A) and the U argument seng ‘money’:(62)    di seng       kabei-kabei-d-i            ba      mi maama he-r-i

        ‘he split and took a bit of money and gave it to the father’               [B07.052.03]The verb naha ‘be not, be lost, NEG’ may serve as the first root in a CV. This is
illustrated in (63), where the CV naha-d- ‘become extinct, cease’ combines with the
pronominal prefix nu- (1PL.E.REC) and is inflected for perfective and durative aspect
with suffixes -i (PFV) and -a (DUR). Note that the verb naha alternates with nai ‘loose,
lost, vanish’ and belongs to the II.f class. It is unclear whether the verb naha is further
derived or not.(63)    ni    nu-naha-d-i-a                      bai       ba,    ri   ko     ri-i

318                                           CHAPTER VII
Another functional root that may be incorporated in a CV is the demonstrative root wó
‘above, DST.H’. In (64), the CV wó-n-r- refers to ‘praising’ of the Lord, lit.: ‘make to be
high, above’. The CV consists of the demonstrative root wó combined with the generic
root n ‘see’ indicating a location ‘be above, high’. A further step in the derivation is the
completive generic root r ‘reach’ that a CV verb referring to a caused event. The CV
stem combines with two arguments, the U argument Lahatala ‘Lord’ is co-indexed with
the prefix ha- (3II.PAT) on the verb.(64)     na     Lahatala ha-wó-n-r-a

7.3      Homogeneous complex verbs
The second type of Abui CVs is referred to as ‘homogeneous’, because roots
combining in a homogeneous CV belong to the generic-verb class. 12 This type of
complex verbs is very flexible and covers sometimes a number of meanings,
determined by the participant constellation. Homogeneous CVs consist of two (or
more) bound generic roots. 13 This is illustrated in (65), where a number of
homogeneous CVs are given derived from the base m ‘be in’.(65)     a. m-a                               b. m-e                        c.    m-i
              be.in-be.at                           be.in-move                    be.in-put
              ‘be in here (near speaker), exist’    ‘come’                        ‘take’The final root determines the valence properties of the stems. In (a), the stem m-a ‘be
in deictic centre, exist’ ends in [-transitive] generic root a ‘be at’ and occurs in
intransitive constructions only. In (b), the stem m-e ‘come’ terminates in the [-
transitive] generic root e ‘move’. The motion verb m-e ‘come’ typically occurs in
intransitive constructions. In (c), the root m ‘be in’ terminates in the [±transitive]
generic root i ‘put’. The resulting CV m-i ‘take, be in’ occurs in both transitive and
intransitive constructions. I conclude that the final root of the homogeneous CVs given
in (65) , determines the valence properties of the stem. This is illustrated in Figure 23:
12 Similar CVs are found in at least two other Papuan languages from the TNG family: Kalam (Pawley, 1987;1991; 1993; 2004; 2005; Pawley and Lane, 1997) and Kobon (Davies, 1984). Both languages have a closed
verb class with about 100 members. Various strategies are employed to describe a large variety of event. As
discussed in 7.2, verbs in these languages may combine with non-verbal roots in complex predicates,
traditionally referred to as ‘adjunct constructions’. In richly documented Kalam, verbs also combine together
to derive more complex verbs that were analysed as SVCs.
13 All generic roots are bound forms, except of the root ì ‘put’ that may occur as an independent predicate inmonoverbal clauses.

homogeneous CV t-a ‘be on’ that is given in (66). These verbs will be discussed in a

intransitive constructions (see 6.2.1). I conclude that the final root is the syntactic head
of the CV. The structure of these verbs is parallel to the heterogeneous CVs discussed
in (8). So far, I have found no evidence that the number of roots combined is a CV is
grammatically restricted in Abui. New stems are derived in a step by step fashion from
the original stems. This is illustrated in (68), where a number of CVs are derived from
the homogenous CV t-a ‘be on’. The arrows indicate the direction of the derivation, as
sometimes only one of the meanings of the CV continues in the further derivation. In
some cases multiple derivational paths are possible. The derivation is cyclic producing
each time a new CV stem.

are discussed in section 7.2.1 and exemplified in (30)-(38), where I gloss the form tak as
‘empty’. The meaning shifts illustrated in (68) may obscure the derivation path. To
avoid confusion and discussion elsewhere in this book, I use the simplified glossing
instead of the full glosses given in this section.
        In this analysis, I take the conservative view that the segments of a verb can
only be analysed as morphemes when there is positive evidence to do so. A
morphologically complex verb that is composed of GVs will only be identified as such
under the strict condition that it occurs in a paradigm with other complex verbs which
shows a minimal contrast in form coupled to a systematic contrast in meaning. This is
why the paradigms discussed below are crucial. There are also many Abui verbs that do
not show systematic form/ meaning contrast with other verbs (see 3.4.4). It may be
that such verbs are morphologically simple forms, but it may also be that some of them
are derived forms whose semantics have shifted so much over time that there is no
evidence of their former morphological composition.
        In 7.3.1, the CVs consisting of two generic roots are discussed. My data covers
the best the homogenous CVs that consists of three generic roots. This substantial
subtype is discussed in section 7.3.2. The CVs that consist of more than three generic
roots are discussed in section 7.3.3.","[340, 341, 342, 343]"
"   8.3.3.1     SVCs with minor verbs expressing manner of movement
In serial construction of manner of movement the major motion verb is serialized with
a minor verb that ‘specifies’ the manner of movement. In (51), the major verb làk ‘leave
for’ combines with the minor verb tuok-tuokda ‘jump’ expressing the manner. Both
verbs share the A argument realized as the NP ama nuku ‘someone’. They also share
their U argument referring to the location of the jumping expressed with the prefix he-
(3II.LOC) that refers to the phrase oro nu ‘over there’. This location is also referred to by
the index verb la ‘be.MD’ that precedes the minor verb:(51)    ama       nuku oro nu         he-làk              la     he-tuok-tuok-d-a

   8.3.3.2      SVCs with minor verb expressing spatial extension
Spatial extension of an event is expressed by the verbs nahang ‘be everywhere’ or re sai
‘anywhere’. The use of the verb nahang ‘be everywhere’ is illustrated in (53). Consider
the following situation. In the early morning people start going up to the hills to work
at their fields. They do not walk in a group; everybody walks up from his own house to
366                                         CHAPTER VIII
his own field. The verb nahang ‘be everywhere’ combines with the major verb mara
‘go up’.(53)   he-l           loku yo          ya          wó        ut         mara           nahang

re ‘reach’ and sai ‘put along’ with a major verb. This construction is used to refer to
events happening for no particular reason, randomly. In most cases, SVCs containing
the minor verbs re ‘reach’ and sai ‘put along’ also contain the locative particle te ‘where’
that refers to an unspecified, default location. This is illustrated in (55), where the major
verb yaar ‘go’ combines with the minor verbs re ‘reach’ which indicates that the
participant attempted to go somewhere. The next verb sai ‘put along’ expresses the
randomness of the motion. The verbs yaar ‘go’ and re ‘reach’ serve as complement for
the verb sai ‘put along’.(55)   di     te=ng           yaar     re           sai

  8.3.3.3     SVC with minor verbs expressing temporal extension
The temporal extension of an event can be encoded by the following type of SVC. The
minor verb that refers to the temporal extension is typically a derived form with a
quantifier base. In (57) the major verb neei ‘eat’ combines with the minor verb nukda
‘become once, happen once’ that is derived from the numeral nuku ‘one’. The minor
verb nuk-d-a ‘become at the same time’ indicates that the eating happened ‘at the same

the serial verb construction as a complement of the verb nuk-d-a ‘become at the same
time’.(57)    [neng loku ya mayol loku nala nee-i]complement ho-nuk-d-a

given. In (a), the extension of an exercise, expressed with the major verb latih-d-i
‘exercise’, is described as lasting till the sun will rise with the minor verb ari-d-a. The
LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC) co-indexes the first part of the serial verb construction as a
complement of the verb ari-d-a ‘appear’. The complement expresses a ‘location=event’
upon which the sun will appear. In (b), a similar example is given. The verb ari-d-i
indicates the temporal extension of ‘sitting’. The first part of the serial verb

8.3.4    SVCs with minor verbs expressing modality
Modality expresses speaker’s position towards the truth, necessity, desirability of the
reported situation including speaker’s belief in its reality, or likelihood (cf. Payne,
1997:244-8). In Abui modality is expressed in two types of SVCs. In the first type of
modal SVCs discussed in this section the minor verb expressing modality follows the
major verb. In the other type, discussed in 8.4.7 the modal verb precedes the major
verb. This is illustrated in (59) where kang ‘be good’ serves as minor verb serialized
with ayong ‘swim’. In (a) potential modality is expressed by kang marking Simon’s
‘ability’ to swim. In (b) kang has a different function; it expresses the realis mode
stressing that Simon ‘really’ swims:(59)    a. Simon di ayong kang                        b. Simon di kang             ayong
           name     3A swim         be.good               name     3A be.good swim
           ‘Simon can swim’                               ‘Simon (really) swims’Minor verbs in modal SVC often express different facets of modality, such as deontic
modality (speaker’s will and desire), epistemic modality (speaker’s certainty or evidence
about the situation), alethic modality (speaker’s opinion about logical consequences of
the situation), and mode (speaker’s belief in reality of the event).
368                                       CHAPTER VIII
        In modal SVCs verbs such as kang ‘be good’, beka ‘be bad’, kaleng ‘avoid’, and
iéng ‘see’ are used to as minor verbs encoding modality. All of these verbs may occur
as a single predicate in a monoverbal clause. In SVCs they share at least one argument
with the major verb; the shared argument may be expressed overtly. In the remainder
of this section I discuss the minor verbs encoding modality in turn: the verb kang ‘be
good’ is discussed in 8.3.4.1, beka ‘be bad’ in 8.3.4.2, followed by kaleng ‘avoid’
described in 8.3.4.3; and finally by iéng ‘see’ in 8.3.4.4.","[388, 389, 390, 391]"

focus on multi-verb constructions. In chapter 7, I describe complex verbs; chapter 8
gives an overview of serial verb constructions. In the appendixes, a number of texts are
given as well as Abui-English and English-Abui wordlists.
        Abui language data are presented in the following fashion, as illustrated in (22).

8.2.1      Narrative SVCs
Narrative5 SSVCs, sometimes referred to as ‘sequential’ SVCs (cf. Aikhenvald, 2006),
consist of a sequence of verbs referring to a number of sub-events that together make
up a description of the referred event. They typically occur in resuming sections of
narratives, in which they report a sequence of sub-events in a condensed step-by-step
fashion. As illustrated in (15) the verbs yaa ‘go’, mit ‘sit’, nate-a ‘stand up’, tanga
‘speak’ and ananra ‘tell’ are serialized to refer to ‘negotiating’.6(15)     ko     pi       yaa     mit     nati-a              tanga         ananra
         soon 1PL.I go           sit     stand.up-DUR        speak.CNT tell.CNT
         ‘we will negotiate’                                                                [B01.081.00:55]The narrative SVC illustrated in (15) consists of five verbs that act as a monoverbal
clause with respect to negation. This is illustrated in (16) where the negator naha (NEG)
follows the final verb and negates all verbs conjoined in the SSVC:(16)     ko     pi       yaa     mit     nate-a              tanga         ananra        naha
         soon 1PL.I go         sit       stand.up-DUR        speak.CNT tell.CNT          NEG
         ‘we will not negotiate’The set of verbs that are used to describe the event of ‘negotiation’ is conventionalized.
The negotiation is described as gathering, sitting down, standing up again and talking,
and in that particular order. Another example is given in (17), where the event of
‘consulting each other’ is referred by the verbs miti ‘sit’ and pun ‘grab’:(17)     ama         he-ta-mi=ng                       mit-i       tanga      nuku pun-i

         ‘the people were consulting it together’                                            [B10.048.08]5 In this description I use the term ‘narrative’ used by van Staden and Reesink (In press) or Pawley (In press).
This term can be used interchangeably with the term ‘narrative’ coined by Aikhenvald (2006).
6 Examples like this present a challenge of the generally accepted claim that SVCs represent what is a singleconceptual event. Abui is not as radical in this extent as a related Papuan language Kalam (cf. Pawley, 1987;
1991; 1993; 2004).
                                 SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS                                  355
Note that this construction is in fact a ‘hybrid’ SVC because the minor verb mi ‘be in’ is
also part of the SVC. It combines in an ASVC.II with the major verb is mit ‘sit’. The
minor verb mi ‘be in’ combines with two U arguments. The first U argument is realized
as the NP ama ‘person’ and as the bound distributive pronoun ta- (DISTR.PAT); the
second U argument is realized with he- referring to the consulted matter.
        Another complex narrative SVCs that must be qualified as ‘hybrid’ is given in
(18) where only the verbs that are glossed in underscored case combine in a SSVC. Note
that the minor verb ng ‘see’ combines with the major verb ì ‘put’ in an allative serial
construction (see 8.4.2.1). The location is expressed with a complement structure
consisting of the verb mi ‘be in’ and its argument. The complement has some
properties of a nominal; however, its internal structure is that of a VP combined with
an NP expressing its U argument (for more details see 8.4.2.3).(18)    ama     mi     sei                 [na-táng       ho-mi]complement=ng       ì

        ‘the people brought it down putting it down in my hands and I hold it’ [B01.078.01:42]Another instance of a narrative SVC that can be qualified as ‘hybrid’ is given in (19).
The verbs tol ‘reach’, sei ‘come down’, and mi-a ‘take’ constitute a SSVC sharing a
single argument di (3A). The minor verbs kang ‘be good’ and la ‘be.MD’ combine with
tol ‘reach’ in an asymmetrical SVC express modality and event location.(19)    di kang        da-táng        la       ha-tol            sei                mi-a

        ‘he (truly) sticks out his hand down to take it’                    [B02.142.01:25]
8.2.2     Locative SVCs
Locative SVCs consist of one or more verbs combined with the locative verb mi-a ‘be
in’. The position of mi-a ‘be in’ is flexible. It can precede, follow, or be in between the
other verbs. The initial position of mi-a ‘be in’ indicates the location of an event
reported by the second verb. This is illustrated in (20) where mi-a ‘be in’ is serialized
with muila ‘play’:(20)    moku bataa wò         mi-a        mui-l-a         mai     bataa ho-fak-i
        kid      tree DST.L be.in-DUR play-give-DUR CONJ tree             3II.REC-break-PFV
        ‘children were playing under the tree, when it broke on them’            [B05.013.01]Note that both verbs in (20) share an argument moku ‘kid, child’. The location of the
event realized as the U argument of mi-a with the NP bataa wò ‘under the tree’. A
356                                        CHAPTER VIII
similar example is given in (21) where mi=a ‘be in’ and natet ‘stand up’ combine in a
locative SVC:(21)   di firai          ba     kupai      ha-ril         mia         do-natet-i
       3A run.CNT LNK forest            3II.INAL-edge be.in-DUR 3I.REC-stand.up.CPL-PFV
       ‘he ran and stopped at the edge of the forest’                         [B07.059.03]Both verbs share the same argument expressed as the free pronoun di (3A). The
location is realized with the NP kupai haril ‘the edge of the forest’.
       The verb mi-a ‘be in’ refers to the origin location of an event when it is
followed by a motion verb. This is illustrated in (22) where the origin location of the
verb yaa ‘go’ is expressed by the argument of mi-a ‘be in’ realized with the NP fala
‘house’:(22)   fala       mi-a          yaa!
       house be.in-DUR          go
       ‘go from the house!, lit. be in the house, go!’                             [B03.009.05]In (23) a similar SVC is given; mi-a is serialized with yei ‘fall’ sharing the argument
moku fila ‘small child’. The location from which the small child is ‘falling’ is an
argument of mi-a ‘be in’ expressed as the NP lik hapong ‘front of the platform’:(23)   moku fila              lik          ha-pong          mi-a        ha-yei

       ‘the small child fell from the front of the platform’                       [B07.059.02]In (24) mi-a ‘be in’ and yaa ‘go’ combine each with one place name in a construction
that can be best translated as ‘from X to Y’. The SVC forms a clause marked with the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD); it expresses the topic of the following clause.","[377, 378, 379]"

The single argument may consist of an NP containing the quantifier loku (PL), or of
two coordinated NPs. In (32), the verb luk ‘rub’ combines with a single A argument

        5.5       Distribution of bound pronouns
In Abui, there are three sets of bound pronouns, listed in Table 22. Typically, [+specific]
U arguments are expressed with these pronouns. In this section, I explain under which
conditions each of the bound pronouns sets is used.3
       In examples (25)-(27) the verb fanga/fangi ‘say’ combines with a bound
pronoun from each set.(25)     e         na      he-tafaa         he-fangi

expressed with the free pronoun na (1SG). The U argument is the NP he-tafaa ‘their3 Multiple realization of the U argument is a feature found in a number of other Alor-Pantar languages. In
Kolana and Kui, the transitive U is realized in multiple ways (Donohue, 1997a). The multiple U argument
realization is argued to be lexicalized for the following Alor-Pantar languages: Klon (Baird, 2005), Kolana
(Donohue, 2004), Tanglapui (Donohue, 1997b), Adang (Haan, 2001), and Western Pantar (Holton to appear-
b), In contrast, as shown in this chapter, Abui argument realization is semantically driven and fluid. In Klon
(Baird, 2005) and Western Pantar (Holton, to appear-b) the multiple argument realization is found in both
transitive and intransitive construction (Split-S).
188                                     CHAPTER V
drums’ co-indexed with the bound pronoun he- (3II.LOC). The example is a fragment of
a bride price negotiation. In such negotiations, the two involved families negotiate
about the presents in form of drums or money to be given to the bride’s family and
others. Here, the speaker bargains saying that he just made an offer about how many
drums the village head will receive. The bound pronoun co-indexes the NP he-tafaa as
theme. It is further discussed in section 5.5.1.
In (26), the verb fangi ‘say’ combines with the bound pronoun ho- (3II.REC) that
expresses the U argument. The U argument is a human recipient affected by the
‘saying’; in other words, somebody who was scold at. More details about the REC bound
pronoun can be found in 5.5.2.(26)    a     ho-fangi         re naha?

word. Generally, free roots, illustrated in (i), are found in all grammatical categories.
Free and bound roots that combine with pronominal prefixes (ii, vi) are either nouns or
verbs. Only verbal roots combine with both pronominal prefixes and aspectual suffixes
(iii, iv, vii). Stems that consist of two roots, of which one is bound, are interpreted as
verbs.
          In Abui, verb stems may display stem alternation. This is illustrated in (5), where
a number of stems show an alternation in their rime. The alternation affects either the
coda, as illustrated in the first and second row, or the nucleus, as illustrated in third row
where no coda is present.(5)    mok              ~    mop                      buuk        ~          buut

completive stems (CPL) refer to an event that has a final point. The inceptive stems (ICP)
choose the opposite perspective; they refer to an event that has an initial point. The

stem alternation is a typical morphological characteristic of the verbal category. It is
discussed in detail in sections 3.4.2.3 and 6.1.1.1 as an aspect marking device.
        In Abui, a number of bound roots cliticize to free forms to form a prosodic
word. They are aspectual particles te (INCP.C), se (INCP.I), si (PHSL.I), and ti (PHSL.C), and
the bound root ng ‘see’. As illustrated in (6), these forms can be characterized as
enclitics, as they are always attached to the preceding prosodic word.(6)     a. pi        làk-i=te                         b. moku loku sakola=ng yaar-i

        3.2      Nouns3.2.1        Semantic properties
The grammatical category of nouns contains items that refer to time-stable concepts:
persons, objects, places, and substances (cf. Payne, 1997:33; Schachter, 1985:7; Anward
et al., 1997:173). In Abui, the words given in (7) are identified as nouns, as they share
these semantic properties.(7)     feela                   ‘friend’                            maama            ‘father’        Ata Pula                ‘name of a person’                  Fan Ata          ‘name of a person’        Ateng Melang            ‘village name, lit. Old Village’    kafak            ‘spear’        ía                      ‘moon’                              war              ‘sun’        wi                      ‘rock’                              fe               ‘pig’However, the definition of the grammatical category of nouns cannot be primarily
semantic as many items that are in some contexts identified as nouns (typically with
non-human referent) may also refer to events. Instead, the grammatical category of
nouns is identified by its distributional properties (see section 3.2.3).","[92, 93]"

  8.3.5.2    SVC with wa / wi ‘be like.MD’
The minor verb wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ refer to the way or manner in which the event was
performed. This type of manner may be considered as ‘medial’, it is obvious to both
speech participants; however, this type is often used in questions, because the speaker
wants to indicate lower awareness of the manner in which an event was performed. The13 This strategy is in fact a form of tail head linkage (THL), a typical feature of for many Papuan languages (cf.de Vries, 2005). In Abui usually last clause is recapitulated in THL constructions. The final verb of
recapitulated clause combines with an complex index verb.
                                   SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS                                           373
referred manner is expressed by the complement that precedes the index verb. In (75)
the major verb ayong ‘swim’ is serialized with the complex verb wi-d-a ‘become like
that’ that serves as minor verb. The first complement is a clause, while the second
complement is a part of serial verb construction.(75)   [di ayong do,]CC [afu he-n-u                            ayong]complement

       ‘he swims like a fish’, lit.: ‘given he swims, he does (so) like a fish swims’     [B07.053.02]Both verbs share the A argument of the verb ayong ‘swim’ realized with the NP afu
‘fish’. The verb ayong ‘swim’ occurs also in the first clause and combines with a
different A argument expressed as the free pronoun di (3A). Logically the verb wida has
to share the argument expressed as the NP afu ‘fish’ with the second verb. It is not
clear whether the verb wi-d-a ‘become like that’ has a second argument. It seems to be
linked in a paratactic topic-comment structure with the first clause di ayong do ‘he
swims’.
         In (76) a fragment of the Lord’s prayer is given. The verb wi-d-a ‘become like
that’ is serialized with the verb mi-a ‘be in’ to express the manner in which the earth
should be. The bracketed structure melang san mi-a ‘be in heaven’ serves as a
complement of the verb wi-d-a ‘become like that’. The second argument of the verb
wi-d-a ‘become like that’ is expressed with the complement clause buku taha mi-a do
‘be on earth’. Observe also that the VP structure o-mi ‘inside you’ is nominalized in a
possessive construction (see also 8.4.2.3).(76)   [o-mi]nominal he-san           he-masolang mi ni-l,                     [buku tah-a

‘be.PRX’. The construction is used to express disapproval of situation being performed
in certain manner that is co-indexed with the index verb wa ‘be like.MD’. The deictic
verb ma ‘be.PRX’ combines with the REC prefix that expresses the speaker as
experiencer of the disapproval.(77)   no-ma                  wa                    naha

  8.3.5.3     SVC with ha ‘be like.DST’
In SVCs, the index verb ha ‘be like.DST’ refers to a manner of way of performing an
event that is new to the addressee and can be considered as ‘distal’. An example
contrasting with (75) is given in (78) below. The minor verb hari ‘make somehow’ is
complex. It combines with the major verb ayon ‘swim’. Both verbs share the aspectual
inflection that is expressed on the minor verb.(78)   di      [afu he-n-u                 ayon]complement ha-r-i
       3A    fish 3II.LOC-be.like.PRX-PRF swim.CPL          be.like.DST.CNT-reach-PFV
       ‘he swam like a fish somehow’                                        [B07.053.02]In imperative construction the verb ha ‘be like.DST’ may occur serialized as simple verb,
not being part of a complex verb. However, in indicative constructions derived forms
tend to be used. Consider now example (79) where the minor verbs ha ‘be like.DST’ and
hal ‘make somehow’ occur serialized with the major verb reng ‘turn to’. In (a) ha is
used in imperative construction; in indicative construction hal ‘make somehow’ must
be used instead. In both cases the serialized verbs share the A argument: a (2SG) in (a),
di (3A) in (b). The U argument of the minor verbs ha and hal is the NP oto ‘car’. The
phrase war sei ‘sun descends, west’ together with the bound pronoun ha- (3II.PAT) is
the U argument of the major verb reng ‘turn to’.(79)   a. a      oto   mi ba war sei             ha-reng             ha!

8.4         Asymmetrical Serial Verb Constructions type II
Asymmetrical SVCs of type II are composed of a grammatically restricted verb (the
‘minor’ verb) followed by an open-class verb (the ‘major’ verb, see also 8.1.2). The
major verb identifies the event and the minor verb has a grammatical function relating
to argument realization and describing event settings. The ordering of the minor and
major verb is parallel to Abui clause structure. In a clause, adverbial modifiers and
arguments precede the VP. On semantic grounds, the major verb can be considered as
the head of the serial construction. Syntactically, the notion of head is problematic, as
the valence of the major verb does not necessarily correspond to the valence of the
whole structure (cf. Aikhenvald, 2006:29).
        In this section, asymmetrical SVCs of type II are discusses according to the
verb-class of the minor verb. In sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.2 I discuss asymmetrical SVCs
that are used mainly in argument realization. In section 8.4.2 I describe asymmetrical

SVCs in which the minor verb belongs to the generic-verb class. The quantification
SVCs are discussed in 8.4.3. In section 8.4.4, I give an overview of SVCs with minor
verbs belonging to the deictic-verb class. SVCs with minor verbs from the positional-
verb class are discussed in section 8.4.5. These SVCs express the position of the
participants involved in the event. The second type of manner SVCs is described
section 8.4.6, it expresses participant oriented manner and differs from the manner
SVC described in 8.3.3 which is event oriented. In section 8.4.7, I discuss the second
type of modal SVCs, which expresses participant oriented modality and differs from the
modal SVC discussed in 8.3.4 which expresses event oriented modality.","[395, 396, 397, 398]"

       Samenvatting in het Nederlands
Spraakkunst van het Abui, een Alorese taalDit boek is een beschrijving van het Abui, één van de meer dan een dozijn talen
gesproken op het eiland Alor, in Oost-Indonesië. De sprekers van het Abui leven in het
bergachtige hart van het eiland. De taal wordt gesproken door ongeveer 16.000 mensen
en kent een aantal dialecten. Dit boek is een beschrijving van de noordelijkste dialecten
Takalelang, Tifolafeng en Alila. Abui is een Papua taal, en is niet verwant met de
Austronesische talen van de omliggende eilanden. Abui is verwant met de talen van de
Trans-New-Guinea taalfamilie, die voornamelijk gesproken worden op het eiland
Nieuw Guinea. Alor ligt op een oeroude migratieroute naar Australie en Nieuw Guinea,
maar de precize informatie over de migraties ontbreekt nog.
         Dit boek bestrijkt verschillende gebieden van het Abui. Op het
introductiehoofdstuk volgt de klankleer (fonologie) in hoofdstuk 2. Abui heeft de
volgende medeklinkers: b, p, m, w, f, d, t, n, s, l, r, j (geschreven as y), ŋ (geschreven als
ng), k, ʔ, h, en een aantal medeklinkers onlangs geleend met de woorden uit het Maleis:
c, g, en ɟ (geschreven als j). Er zijn vijf klinkers: ɑ, ɛ, ɪ, ɔ, ʊ die met gewone letters a, e,
i, o, en u, worden geschreven. Allemaal hebben ze lange klinkers als tegenhanger. Deze
lange klinkers worden met twee letters gescheven: aa [ɑː], ee [ɛː], ii [ɪː], oo [ɔː], uu [ʊː].
Binnen de lettergreep vinden we niet meerdere medeklinkers naast elkaar. Dergelijke
medeklinkerclusters worden vermeden; soms worden in morfologisch complexe
structuren klinkers toegevoegd om de clusters te vermijden. Naast lange klinkers, is het
mogelijk twee verschillende klinkers te combineren binnen dezelfde lettergreep. Zulke
lettergrepen worden altijd beklemtoond. Het basisklemtoonpatroon is jambisch, geteld
van het einde van het woord. Uitzonderingen vormen de woorden met een zwaare
voorlaatste lettergreep, want die trekt de klemtoon aan. Naast de klemtoon en de lengte
kunnen de lettergrepen ook nog in toon verschillen zoals fír [fɪ̀r] ‘ster’ en fir [fɪ́r]
‘haasten’. De woorden met een hoge toon worden gemarkeerd met het accent aigu teken.
Abui naamwoorden hebben maximaal drie lettergrepen, maar de werkwoorden kunnen
langer zijn.
         Hoofdstuk 3 behandelt Abui woordsoorten. Het begint met een bespreking van
de woordbouw. Abui is een agglutinerende taal; dat betekent dat een woord uit een
aantal wortels, voor- en achtervoegsels kan bestaan. De naamwoorden hebben meestal
een simpele morfologische structuur. Er zijn geen naamvallen, en geen uitgangen voor
enkelvoud en meervoud. De naamwoorden die naar lichaamsdelen verwijzen, krijgen
meestal een voorvoegsel dat naar de bezitter verwijst. Voor de meerderheid van deze
woorden is zo’n voorvoegsel verplicht. De morfologie van de werkwoorden is in het
algemeen meer complex dan die van naamwooden. Werkwoordelijke stammen kunnen
combineren met (maximaal) twee voornaamwoordelijke voorvoegsels en drie
achtervoegsels voor aspect. Zowel de voorvoegsels als de achtervoegsels kunnen
verplicht zijn. Werkwoordelijke samenstellingen komen veel voor: hoofdstuk 7 is er
volledig aan gewijd.
538                          SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS
        Het tweede deel van hoofdstuk 3 geeft een overzicht van Abui woordstoorten,
die verdeeld worden in open en gesloten klassen. Naamwoorden en werkwoorden
behoren tot de open klassen. De gesloten klassen zijn bijvoeglijke naamwoorden,
bijwoorden, demonstratieven, telwoorden, voegwoorden, en vraagwoorden.
Werkwoordelijke en naamwoordelijke stammen kunnen niet altijd van elkaar worden
onderscheiden. Bijvoorbeeld de stam yaa betekent zowel ‘gaan’, als ‘weg, pad’; en de
stam tanga betekent ‘spreken’ en ‘spraak, taal’. Voor een ‘Papua’ taal is zulke
ambiguïteit ongebruikelijk, maar in de omliggende Austronesische talen komt het vaker
voor.
        Hoofdstuk 4 behandelt de Abui naamwoorden. Naast naamwoorden die naar
mensen en plaatsen verwijzen, kent het Abui naamwoorden, die naar substanties en
naar concrete voorwerpen verwijzen. Deze naamwoorden komen vaak voor als een lid
van een samenstelling of worden in een naamwoordsgroep (Noun Phrase, NP) gevolgd
door een ander naamwoord. In beide gevallen wordt hun referentie nader bepaald door
het andere lid van de samenstelling of de woordgroep.
        De Abui naamwoordgroep heeft een vaste woordvolgorde. In het algemeen is
het eerste lid het hoofd. Alleen aanwijzende voornaamwoorden (deictic demonstratives), en
bezittelijke voornaamwoorden gaan aan het hoofd vooraf. Andere leden van de NP
volgen op het hoofd: naamwoorden, bijvoegelijke naamwoorden of statieve
werkwoorden, telwoorden en aanwijzende voornaamwoorden (anaphoric demonstratives).
Daarnaast bestaat de mogelijkheid om een betrekkelijke bijzin of een ander zinsdeel aan
het hoofdnomen te koppelen door middel van het voegwoord ba (LNK) dat ook zinnen
aan elkaar ‘linkt’. Het opmerkelijke is dat een dusdanig gekoppeld zinsdeel zich op de
plaats van zijn eenvoudige tegenhanger bevindt. Dus bijzinnen die de locatie of bezitter
uitdrukken staan voor het hoofd en alle andere volgen erop.
        Hoofdstuk 5 bespreekt de manier waarop de argumenten van een
werkwoordelijk gezegde uitgedrukt worden. In deze beschrijving worden niet de
traditionele termen onderwerp (subject) en lijdend voorwerp (object) gebruikt, maar de
noties Actor (A) argument versus Undergoer (U) argument. De motivatie hiervoor is dat de
wijze waarop een argument uitgedrukt wordt, niet puur grammaticaal bepaald is, maar
vooral afhankelijk is van de semantische eigenschappen van de participanten van een
gebeurtenis. Deelnemers die actief participeren in de gebeurtenis worden als het A
argument uitgedrukt in transitieve en in intransitive constructies. Dat wil dus zeggen dat
in na wan sieng neei ‘ik heb al rijst gegeten’, de eerste persoon enkelvoud participant
op dezelfde manier wordt uitgedrukt als de eerste persoon enkelvoud deelnemer in na
wan firai ‘ik heb al gerend’: allebei met het voornaamwoord na. Maar wanneer
deelnemers niet actief deelnemen, en een gebeurtenis meer ‘ondergaan’, dan worden ze
als een U argument uitgedrukt, door middel van een voornaamwoordelijk voorvoegsel
in plaats van een vrijstaand voornaamwoord. Dus de eerste persoon enkelvoud
deelnemer in di wan na-weli ‘hij heeft mij gewassen’ wordt met een voorvoegsel
uitgedrukt, op dezelfde manier als in wan na-riki ‘ik ben geworden’. De deelnemers in
gebeurtenissen als na wan naweli ‘ik heb me al gewassen’ worden zowel met het A
argument als met het U argument uitgedrukt zoals ook het geval is in vergelijkbare
constructies in het Nederlands of Engels.
        Er zijn drie verschillende typen verbuigingen voor de voornaamwoordelijke
voorvoegsels die het U argument uitdrukken. De voorvoegsels met met de klinker e in
het enkelvoud en een i in het meervoud verwijzen naar een locatie of belanghebbende
                              SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS                          539
(location/benefactive). De voorvoegsels met een o in het enkelvoud en een u in het
meervoud drukken altijd een ontvanger (recipient) uit. De voorvoegsels met de klinker a
in het enkelvoud en een i in het meervoud drukken de participant uit die het minst
actief is en het meest een ‘lijdend’ voorwerp is (patient). Sommige werkwoorden kunnen
combineren met alle drie de voorvoegsels. Het werkwoord loi ‘verwijderen, wegleggen’,
bijvoorbeeld, combineert met he- in kaai he-loi ‘een hond blaft erop’. In deze zin
verwijst he- naar een plaats. In kaai ho-loi ‘een hond blaft op hem’, verwijst ho- naar
een persoon. In kaai ha-loi ‘een hond jaagt het weg’ verandert de betekenis, en wordt
ha- verstaan als datgene dat verjaagd wordt. Vervoegingen als deze komen zeer vaak
voor, en worden op een productieve wijze toegepast.
         Hoofdstuk 6 behandelt het werkwoordelijke gezegde. Ten eerste wordt
uitgelegd hoe Abui werkwoorden hun stam vervoegen om het werkwoord aspect weer
te geven. De vervoeging van de stam geeft aan of de gebeurtenis begint (inceptive),
voltooid is (completive) of voortgezet wordt (continuative). Bijvoorbeeld het werkwoord
‘rennen’ heeft twee stammen firei en firai. De stam firei wordt gebruikt om aan te
geven dat het rennen begint of pas begonnen is (inceptive), terwijl firai aangeeft dat het
rennen inmiddels volbracht is (completive). Er zijn een aantal werkwoordklassen die hun
stammen op deze wijze variëren. Het werkwoord kan vervolgens maximaal drie aspect–
achtervoegsels krijgen. Deze geven aan of de gebeurtenis begonnen of volbracht is, of
nog doorgaat. Hierboven zagen we al dat een werkwoord combineert met een of twee
voorvoegsels die het U argument uitdrukken. Abui werkwoorden zijn flexibel, hetzelfde
werkwoord kan in een transitieve constructie gebruikt worden (met twee participanten)
maar ook in een intransitieve constructie (met slechts één participant). Ditransitieve
constructies zoals ‘ik gaf Jan een boek’ komen in Abui niet voor. Deze constructies
worden met een seriële constructie uitgedrukt zoals na sura mi Yance he-ri ‘ik nam een

         Het werkwoordelijke gezegde is de kern van de zin. Het kan combineren met
andere zinsdelen. Naamwoordsgroepen (NPs), voornaamwoorden, bijwoorden,
aanwijzende voornaamwooden (deictic demonstratives) staan links van het gezegde.
Ontkennende en bevestigende partikels, en anaforische voornaamwoorden (anaphoric
demonstratives) volgen het werkwoordelijke gezegde.
         Hoofdstuk 7 is in zijn geheel gewijd aan complexe werkwoorden. Abui beschikt
over een gesloten klasse van generieke werkwoorden (generic verbs). Generieke
werkwoorden hebben een zeer algemene betekenis die vaak pas in het zinsverband
duidelijk wordt. Het zijn werkwoordsvormen die uit een enkele medeklinker of klinker
bestaan, zoals d ‘houden, grijpen, verkrijgen, pakken’. Met behulp van generieke
werkwoorden worden complexe werkwoorden afgeleid van zowel werkwoordelijke
stammen als andere stammen. Bijvoorbeeld van de naamwoordsstam namu ‘wond’ kan
met het generieke werkwoord l ‘geven’ het complexe werkwoord namu-l ‘verwonden’
worden afgeleid. Waneer de voltooide (completive) stam r van hetzelfde generieke
werkwoord ‘geven’ wordt gebruikt dan wordt de betekenis van namu-r ‘gewond raken’.
         Hoofdstuk 8 behandelt seriële werkwoorden. Seriële werkwoorden zijn clusters
van werkwoorden die zich als één groep gedragen: ze vallen onder één ontkenning, één
intonatiepatroon en delen minimaal één argument. Dezelfde gebeurtenis die in het
Nederlands met een enkel werkwoord beschreven kan worden, beschrijft men in Abui
meestal met meerdere werkwoorden. Bijvoorbeeld ‘terugbrengen’ wordt in het Abui
540                          SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS
uitgedrukt met de werkwoorden wai ‘draaien’, mi ‘nemen’, en me ‘komen’. Op deze
wijze worden gebeurtenissen feitelijk opgedeeld in deel-gebeurtenissen. Ik verdeel de
seriële werkwoorden in twee groepen: symmetrische en asymmetrische seriële
werkwoorden. Symmetrische seriële werkwoorden bestaan uit werkwoorden die geen
afhankelijkheid van elkaar vertonen zoals pi yaa mit natet tanga ananra ‘we
onderhandelen’ letterlijk ‘we gaan, zitten, staan op spreken en vertellen’ en dat allemaal
onder één intonatiepatroon, in één adem. Asymmetrische seriële werwoorden vertonen
een afhankelijkheid ten opzichte van elkaar. Een van de werkwoorden gedraagt zich als
het hoofd van de cluster. Het andere werkwoord heeft een hulpfunctie. Bijvoorbeeld in
na sieng nee kanri ‘ik heb de rijst opgegeten, let. ik at rijst voltooide’, drukt het
werkwoord kanri ‘voltooien’ het aspect uit van het eten. In na me na-riki ‘ik werd ziek’
is de functie van me ‘komen’ om aan te geven dat het ziek worden op een geleidelijke
wijze gebeurt.
        Het boek wordt afgesloten met een aantal teksten en een woordenlijst.

7.1.3     Compositional and semantic properties of CVs
Abui CVs consist of two or more morphemes; these morphemes are free or bound
roots that build up a complex stem. The set of roots found in the initial position of the
stem is not restricted. The set of roots found in second position is restricted. In vast
majority, the second (and following roots) belongs to generic-verb class. Before I
elaborate on the compositional and semantic properties of Abui CVs, first I give a brief
overview of Abui generic roots.
        In the Table 24, the inventory of Abui generic-verb class is given (cf. 3.4.5.2). It
comprises eighteen mono-segmental roots. The phonological form is given in the left-
hand column, the orthographic representation in the second column, and the used gloss
in the third column and the possible interpretations in the right-hand column.

The generic roots are divided in two subgroups according to their valence properties.
Those given in the above part of the table may be used in both transitive and
intransitive construction. With respect to their phonological shape, these generic roots
are characterized as consonants or high vowels. In the lower part of the table, the low-
vowel roots are given. These roots are always intransitive. Further, the roots that are
phonologically characterized as alveodental liquids (l, r), non-labial nasals (n, ng), and
unvoiced alveodental obstruents (t, s) are analyzed as alternating roots. Their
alternation reflects the internal temporal structure of the referred event (Aktionsart).
They refer to the same event that is viewed either as having an endpoint (completive),
or an initial point (inceptive).
        Having discussed the inventory of Abui generic-verb class, now I turn back to
the complex verbs. In this description, I distinguish between two major types of CVs:
(i) HETEROGENEOUS COMPLEX VERBS, in which the conjoined roots belong to different
classes (of which at least the final root belongs to the generic-verb class), and (ii)
HOMOGENOUS COMPLEX VERBS, composed of two or more generic roots. This distinction
                                               COMPLEX VERBS                                                  297
is illustrated in (6) and (67). Heterogeneous CVs are explored in detail in section 7.2,
homogeneous CVs in section 7.3. In what follows, I will identify the morphological
structure of CVs. I use the distinction between free and bound forms and alternation in
aspectual marking to identify the head of a CV.
         Consider now example (6), where a number of CVs derived from the bound
root bek ‘bad’ are given:(6)      a. bek-a           b. bek-d-a                     c.    bek-d-i             d. bek-a-d-i

              ‘be bad’            ‘be getting bad, broken’       ‘get bad, broken’         ‘get ill, pass away’The root bek ‘bad’ combines with one (a-c) or two generic verbs (d) in heterogeneous
CV stems.4 The verbs derived from the root bek ‘bad’ are exemplified in (7).(7)      a. di de-toku            beka       he-daweng           buuk-e

occur in intransitive constructions (see 6.2.4.2). In (b-e), the [±transitive] generic root d
‘hold, get’ is the final root of a CV. It derives verbs that refer to internally caused
change of state or condition that may occur in both transitive and intransitive
construction. The final root of a CV determines the valence and semantic properties of
the CV stem (aspectual suffixes are not counted). It is the syntactic ‘head’ of a
heterogeneous CV. It is in line with the head-final character of Abui morpho-syntax,
where objects precede verbs and negations and conjunctions occur at the end of a
4 Note that the morpheme a is polysemous, it is treated differently in (a) and (b). In (a), it derives the stative
verb beka ‘be bad’ from the bound root bek ‘bad’. Because it derives a new verb, it is treated as a generic root
‘be at’. In (b), it expresses durative aspect (-DUR). It is the generic root d ‘hold’ that derives the new CV ‘get
bad, break down’ and requires aspectual inflection. In (c), it alternates with the aspectual suffix -i (PFV). Both
meanings expressed by the form a are probably historically related (for more details about aspectual
inflection, see 6.1.1).
298                                              CHAPTER VII
clause, GVs that derive denominal verbs also occur in final position. As discussed in
4.3, nominal compounds also are right-headed.
        Consider now example (8). The free root al/ar ‘burn’ combines with one (or
more) generic roots in CVs. Only the CV stem ar-a ‘be in fire’ is intransitive. The other
CV stems are [±transitive], as their final roots l ‘give’, ng ‘see’, d ‘hold’ and i ‘put’ are
[±transitive]. As discussed in 6.2.4.2, many stative verbs are derived with the generic
verb a ‘be at’. They typically occur in intransitive constructions. The [-transitive] generic
root a ‘be at’ that precedes those roots does restrict the valence of the stems in the
same way as it does when it is the final root such as in ar-a ‘be in fire’.(8)      ar                 ‘burn’                                ar-a          ‘be in fire, fire n.’

         ar-a-d-        ‘get burning, catch fire’                 ar-u-i        ‘incinerate, turn in ashes’
         burn.CPL-be.at-hold                                      burn.CPL-leave-putTherefore, also for these CVs I conclude that the final root is the syntactic ‘head’ that
determines the valence as schematically illustrated in Figure 22:                    VP                                                   V[±transitive]                           V[-transitive]                      V[-transitive]

                         Figure 22: Structure of ar-a ‘be in fire’ and ar-a-l ‘set on fire’In general, the derivation of new CVs is a verb productive process. However, the
generic roots deriving new CVs do not occur each with the same frequency. The most
frequently used generic root is d ‘hold, get’. This root is also the default generic root
that may combine with loan roots. The other frequently occurring roots are a ‘be at’, l
‘give’, r ‘reach’, ng ‘see’, t ‘lie’, and i ‘put’.5 The remaining roots do not occur frequently
and are not productive in derivation of new verbs and seem almost exclusively
restricted to the homogenous CVs.","[318, 319, 320, 321]"
