       The fact that the scope of the negator tɨma is the following can be manipulated
by certain conjunctions, such as riay „also.‟ For instance, in (94), the scope of tɨma isprecisely the object pronoun ene „you‟ which appears following riay. In the discoursecontext, a person is calling someone in particular, but other people answer his call. So inprevious utterances, he keeps saying: “I didn‟t call you‟. Thus, in (94) the act of callingis not being negated, but only who is being called.(94)   b. riay ene            tɨma ta     tsapuki=uy

"Example (28b) shows how this construction is negated. In this particular utterance, thenegative particle ni is placed in front of the predicate NP, „your sister in law.‟ Example(28c), which was elicited based on (28b), shows the affirmative counterpart.",[469]

4.6.1. Negative particles       The language has two negative particles: tɨma and ni. While the first is used tonegate the whole clause or to negate the predicate, the later is mostly used to negatespecific arguments. In addition, the use of tɨma and ni seems to be associated with
particular idiolects and styles. In Chapter IX it will be argued that the scope of tɨma isthe constituent that immediately follows it. Examples in (42) illustrate the differentpositions in which tɨma can appear in the clause.

         „He came back not good (sick)‟        Below are examples with the negative particle ni=. In contrast to tɨma, ni isused to negate single units, mostly arguments of the predicate. For instance, in (43a),below, the scope of negation is „paiche‟, because if the negation would involve theexistential predication, the form temende „there-is-not‟ would have been used. In (43c),while ni negates „person‟, tɨma negate „tell anyone.‟

8.2.1.2. Negation in existential constructions       There are two ways to make negative existential predicates. The firstconstruction utilizes the particle tɨma, which is placed in front of emete to negate thewhole construction. As a result we have the construction: [NEG emete NP] whosepropositional meaning is „X does not exist‟. This is presented in examples (36a, b).","[474, 475]"
"        Of the many aspectual distinctions available to verbal predicates, I have foundonly the completive marker -pa attached to the noun phrase predicate, as in (7a).(7)     ay              wayna-pa(=tsuri)

         ii) „He turns (turned) into a woman‟ (talking about a gay man) (ED)        Note that example (7a) can receive two interpretations, „young girl‟ and „a gayman.‟8.1.1.2. Negation and juxtaposition constructions         As introduced in §4.6.1, one of the main strategies of negation in KK is the useof the independent particle tɨma. In verbal constructions, this particle usually goes in the
                                                427
first position of the sentence, and in this way the whole predicate is negated. However,when we want to change the scope of negation, this particle can be moved to some otherslots. The negative version of equative and proper inclusion predicate constructions isformed simply by adding the particle tɨma between the two NPs. That is: [NP NEG NP].","[456, 457]"
"          Examples (29a-c) come from a narrative in which the speaker is talking abouther first trip by airplane.

            „We hear only the wind‟       The morpheme =pura sporadically attaches to the negative particle tɨma. As
mentioned earlier, the language has two negative particles: tɨma and ni. In naturaldiscourse, the distribution of these particles is skewed; ni occurs rarely and seemsrelated to particular idiolects. While some speakers use both, some others avoid nialtogether. In the first case, there is a tendency to use tɨma to negate the whole clause, orto negate the verb phrase. In contrast, ni is used to negate single units, mostly argumentsand sometimes the predicate. A general characterization of tɨma is that its scope coversthe (biggest) constituent that immediately follows it, including [SVO], [VO], and someadverbs. The examples below show this, where the negated portion is in bold.(30)     a. tɨma       ra=tseta   eyu-n                        [SVO]

        In natural texts, =pura attaches to tɨma, but extremely rarely to ni.12 Further, inall the instances where the negative particle is marked by =pura, it is the constituent infirst position within the clause, hence focusing on the negation of the whole predication.(31)    a. tɨma=pura           r=ɨwama.

          „So, he cannot hear anymore/he is no longer able to hear‟        In all these examples the morpheme tɨma is negating the whole sentence. Thecontexts for the sentences in (31a) were set up by the speaker in the precedingdiscourse. In rainy season, communities that are close to the rivers are expected to getdestroyed and literally disappear. In (31a) the speaker is reporting that because theymoved the community to another place, this is no longer true. In the same text, thespeaker said that people used to walk through the forest to get to the community, andthis was a difficult journey. In contrast, now they have a path (31b). The context for(31c) is this: the speaker says that once his friend started having ear-aches. With time he12
   Below is an example where =pura attaches to ni. The speaker is reporting that nowadays they have all
kinds of fish, except for „paiche‟, the most valued fish in the Amazon. The scope of negation is „paiche‟,
because if the negation were to involve the existential predication, the form temente „there-is-not‟ would
have been used.

got worse, so now he is no longer able to hear. In terms of propositions, the logicaltruth value is reversed and the speaker is focusing on the truth value „false.‟(31‟) a. FALSE <it gets destroyed>       b. FALSE <we go through the forest>       c. FALSE <he can hear>       As Givon (2001) points out, with negative constructions the speaker is somehowcorrecting the hearer‟s misguided beliefs. In that sense, they could be thought of ascontrastive. However, they are not contrastive in the sense of Watters (1979). Recallthat Watters proposes counter-assertive polar focus for “the speaker‟s replycontradicting the hearer‟s assertion.” None of the examples with =pura on the negativeparticle is the hearer‟s reply to what the speaker has previously asserted. Thus, theconstruction [NEG=pura [clause]] is better categorized as Watter‟s polar focus. In thedatabase, there are no instances of contradicting replies, so at this point we do not knowwhether any specific construction would be associated with this function.","[735, 736, 737, 738]"
"                9.1.2.1.1.     Certainty =tin        Speakers use =tin to express certainty regarding the proposition expressed in agiven utterance. In elicitation, speakers told me =tin means si „yes‟, like the Spanishconjunction to mark strong assertions. To illustrate this claim, one speaker provided methe example in (25) that involves contrast. The context given for this example was this:one guy and his mother have an accident and someone asks: have they died? Theanswer to this question would be (25), where the first clause is a negative statement, andthe second a positive one. The speaker then translated the whole sentence into Spanishas: la mamá no murió, él si „The mother doesn‟t die, he does‟.",[516]
"        To negate this left-dislocation construction, similar to the cases described above,the negative particle tɨma is placed in front of the predicate noun phrase; that is, rightafter the dislocated NP. However, in these cases there is a clear pause between thedislocated NP and the negative particle. In (11a-b) that pause is expressed by a comma.(11)    a. Joan, tɨma napitsara=ay
          Joan NEG man=3F.OBJ
          „Joan, she is not a man‟ (ED)
                                                429
        b. yukun wayna-kɨra, tɨma uyari awa=ay
          DEM woman-DIM NEG again person=3F.OBJ
         „That little woman, she is no longer a person‟ (she got transformed again)        In terms of their function, this type of sentence is used in more marked contextsthan the simple juxtaposition of two NPs. For examples, these constructions were usedwhen the speakers failed to identify the sex of the referents after hearing their names. Inthose cases I explained the situation like this: “Joan is a woman, Jack is a man” and,after this clarification, the speakers said the examples in (10).","[458, 459]"
"Nevertheless, the overall meaning of (28c) only reaffirms what has been said bySpeaker B in (28b). Clearly, in these examples an interpretation of the pura-markedpronoun as being under focus is not viable. With =pura at the end of the sentence the                                           705
speaker cues the hearer to construe the whole sentence as being in focus rather than thestressed adverbial element or the pura-marked pronoun only.
11.2.4.2.     =pura and negation          Additional cases of sentence focus are found in negative constructions. It is wellknown that there are close connections between Focus and Negation (Givón 2001).","[734, 735]"
"         The language has two negative particles: tɨma and ni. In natural discourse, thedistribution of these particles is skewed. In the database, there are about 276 instancesof tɨma, whereas ni appears only around 124 times. It could be, though, that ni is relatedto particular idiolects and styles. For instance, while some speakers use both forms,some others avoid ni altogether. On the other hand, we found one speaker that makesexclusive use of ni. The syntactic distribution of the two negative morphemes isdescribed below.",[559]
"6.4. Adverbial words       Adverbial elements modify the predicate or a larger syntactic unit whichincludes the predicate. While adverb as a word class is convenient analytically, it stillrequires further work before suitable criteria for characterizing it as a set can be clearlyidentified. In addition to placement in the clause, prototypical adverbial elements sharethe following features:      a) Unlike verbs,                 they cannot be the main predicate of the clause                 they cannot be nominalized by -n to operate in attributive predication                 they do not take any morphology associated with verbs, such as                  aspectual markers and valence changing devices.      b) Unlike nouns,                 they cannot be the head of a noun phrase

"Only the first pattern of negation — the one that includes tɨma— has been attested incombination with tense clitics within a single utterance.

       An additional use of sentence-focus constructions is not to communicate thepropositional content of the clause but to make explicit that both the speaker and thehearer have knowledge of the propositions, that they share a common ground. Incontrast to the examples discussed above, here the propositions are entirelypresupposed. Examples that fall in this category include hearer‟s repetitions to confirm„he got the point‟, speaker‟s conclusive remarks, etc.(26) a. Speaker A: ay         na     chita-ri=utsu
                   already    2SG be.a.lot-PROG=FUT1

                 „(Yes,) they celebrate a lot‟
    Examples in (26-27) could be characterized in terms of polarity. As presented in§11.1.2, for constructions in which the whole predication is in focus, Watters (1979)proposes the category polar focus. He argues that in polar focus constructions, it is thetruth value TRUE or FALSE which the speaker asserts or counter-asserts concerning aproposition. Based on the communicative context, it could be argued that the speakeruses sentence focus constructions involving =pura to asserts the truth value of theproposition.","[732, 733]"

The particle -tsunka, in (40d), has not beenintroduced yet. This is a discourse level morpheme that expresses the speaker‟s surprisewhen an unexpected or unusual situation happens; it is against his expectations and heresists believing it. In Amazonian Spanish it is usually translated with the expression yavuelta, which bears counter-expectation, surprise, and disbelief. This resembles whatDeLancey (2002) calls mirativity.

        In the absence of an abrupt creole genesis, an alternative hypothesis could bethat the simplification of the TG language spoken in the region was gradual rather thana radical process with “the emerging contact language at once becoming the language ofthe community.” (Thomason and Kaufman 1997:150). In fact, Cabral does point outlanguage contact and bilingualism centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans to that areaof the Amazon. For instance, she suggests that “the presence of lexical elements ofArawakan (Maipurean) origin in Kokama/Omáwa may date from before the creation ofthe missionary villages or reducciones, and even before the European presence in theUpper Amazon area” (2007:370). However, arguing for the abrupt creole hypothesis,Cabral posits that during the first centuries of colonization (15th and 16th century)Kokama and Omawa were only slightly different from Tupinamba, and that by the endof the Jesuit period (end of 17th century) they lost most of their TG genetic features(1995:304).","[784, 785, 786]"

pɨtani „be reddish,‟ ɨkɨra „be greenish,‟ tini „be clear, white,‟ etc. ), dimensions (i.e.,
misha „be small,‟ nua/tua „be big‟), physical characteristics (i.e., ɨpɨ „be soft‟, yapua „beround‟), and flavors (i.e., tse „be sweet,‟ irawa „be bitter‟). For a complete list of theattested stative verbs and the constructions in which they occur, see §7.4.","[462, 463]"

9.4.2. Content questions       Content questions — also known as information questions or constituentquestions — are formed by means of interrogative words. Cross-linguistically, some ofthe strategies used to form polar questions are also attested in content questions, buttheir use seems less wide-spread. For instance, morphological marking and intonationmay be optional (König & Siemund 2007). This is the case in KK.","[571, 572, 573]"
"These are “(i) special intonation patterns, (ii) interrogative particles, (iii) the addition ofspecial tags, (iv) disjunctive-negative structures, (v) a change in the relative order of                                                  537

(Faust 1972:99; translation mine) or “the single emphatic particle, which generallyfollows the completive particles ay and úcu occurring sentence initially” (Cabral1995:182). However, in the database for this study, =pura seems far more functionallyproductive and distributionally complex. The morpheme =pura is attested on nouns,verbs, pronouns, interrogative words, and particles as shown below:(3) a. sɨɨɨɨh            iy=ɨrɨrɨta     pɨta=pura      naniwa

       Compared to its frequency on nouns (3a), the frequency of =pura on verbs (3b)is very low and it only occurs on a restricted set of them. Also, in the majority of cases,the host verb is not the nucleus of the clause, but rather it tends to be the predicate of adependent clause. Very often, =pura appears on pronominal forms (3c). In addition,=pura can attach to interrogative words and demonstrative pronouns (3d). Finally,=pura combines with the negative particles (3e).","[709, 710]"
"       Further, constructions form an interrelated network. For instance, simple clauseconstructions reflect scenes basic to human experience, “such as that of someonecausing something to move or change state, someone experiencing something,something moving, and so on” (Goldberg 1995:5). Goldberg (1995) emphasizes that alinguistic pattern must be recognized as a construction as long as some aspect of itsform, meaning, or function is not predictable from its component parts or from otherconstructions that exist in a given language. She adds, however, that patterns are storedeven if they are fully predictable as long as they occur with sufficient frequency. Giventhe following sentences:(3)    a. Joe bought a book                   Transitive construction
       b. Joe bought Tom a book               Ditransitive construction
       c. Joe gave Tom a book                 Ditransitive construction
                                            49
       While (3a) entails getting an item, (3b) entails getting an item plus intendedtransfer of it. According to non-constructionist approaches, the form and generalinterpretation of basic sentence patterns of a language are determined by semanticand/or syntactic information specified by the main verb. Thus, buy in (3b) does notmean the same thing as buy in (3a), and so there must be a rule deriving buy in (3b)from buy in (3a), which allows it to be used with the appropriate meaning in theconstruction in (3b).","[78, 79]"
"9.3.2. Constructions with ni       Compare to tɨma, the productivity of ni is more limited. It could be hypothesizedthat the source of this morpheme is Tupí-Guaraní *n/ni-…-i (Jensen:1998:545). Asindicated above, tɨma is twice as productive as ni. This fact has to do with the capability
of these forms in terms of their scope of negation. Unlike tɨma, which can negateanything from clauses to adverbs, ni is used primarily to negate single units, generallycore arguments of the clause.(96)    a. wapuru      katupe-n=pura   aki    tipishka=ka

       „There is no way he can get the spear from this person‟       In the database there are some instances in which ni seems to have scope overthe whole sentence (98) or the verb phrase (99). Most of these examples were producedby a speaker that uses exclusively ni.(98)   a. ni         tapɨa=tua   akɨcha

         „Two of them are dead‟
       We saw already that the focus marker =pura often attaches to tɨma. In contrast,my corpus contains only one example in (100) where =pura attaches to the negativeparticle ni. In the narrative, the speaker reports that nowadays they have all kinds offish, except for paiche, one of the most valued fish in the Amazon. The scope ofnegation is paiche: has the negation involved the existential predicate, the form temende„there-is-not‟ would have been used.(100) aypuka      ni=pura             ɨwatsu emete
       currently NEG2=FOC             paiche exist
      „At present, it exists no paiche (fish.sp)‟
9.3.3. Interaction of tɨma and ni
       Both tɨma and ni can occur within a single clause, as shown in (101). In thosecases, it is clear that the piece of information marked by ni is within the scope ofnegation of tɨma. In (101b) ni negates „a letter‟, whereas tɨma negates the whole verb
phrase „know a letter.‟ Similarly, in (101c), while ni negates „person‟, tɨma negate „tellanyone.‟(101) a. ta           tɨma ikua ni=wepe               letra

1   Introduction                                       CHAPTER I                                    INTRODUCTION       This document aims to provide a comprehensive account of the grammar ofKokama-Kokamilla (henceforth, also KK), an Amazonian language spoken in Peru. Thepresent chapter gives a general overview of this dissertation. It includes the motivationsfor this study (§1.1), the overall organization of the dissertation (§1.2), an introductionto the KK people (§1.3) and their language (§1.4). It also offers the typological profileof the language (§1.5) and the theoretical framework followed in this study (§1.6). Thisdissertation entails a significant fieldwork component. Each chapter of this dissertationis grounded essentially in text data, which are the outcomes of several projects I carriedout with the KK since 1997.The methodology employed to gather the data usedthroughout the dissertation is explained in detail in Chapter II.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"
"(29)   Speaker A:      raepe kukama       kukamiria=kana
                       there Kokama       Kokamilla=PL.M
                       „There are Kokama-Kokamillas over there (Ninarumi village)‟       Speaker A:      yay-ti
                       also-CER
                       „Yes, also (there)‟       This brings us to the clitic =tika which shows up in a few utterances in mycorpus. Interestingly enough, =tika seems to contain =ti. However, there are reasons tonot categorize =tika as another member of the set MOD1. The main reason for notdoing that is that the set of MOD1 clitics do not co-occur. Although =tika is a secondposition clitic, it does co-occur with =tin, as in (30). In that sense =tika behavesdifferently than the others.(30)   ra=purara-ka […]        yuka=tika=tin
       3SG.M=find-REI          that-CER2-CER       itaki tsai=pura=tu
       stone something.hard=FOC=AUG
       „He finds […] that (which) is a huge rock‟                                                490
       Meaning wise, =tika also conveys certainty but, unlike =tin, the same degree ofcertainty is also expected from the addressee. In every instance of =tika, the utterancemakes reference to a proposition which is assumed to be also known by the hearer. Thesemantics of =tika could be paraphrased as “it is true, you and I know that.” Considerthe examples in (31) which come from two traditional stories. The last portion of (31a)could be paraphrased „as you and I know, shamans sing cure-songs.‟ Example in (31b)implies that both speaker and addressee know about this creature called ururi.(31)   a. ukɨrɨ-ari inu                ikara-ri;
         sleep-PROG 3PL.F              sing-PROG        inu=tika      ikara=pura
        3PL.F-CER2 sing=FOC
       „While they (creatures) are sleeping, they (the shamans) are singing cure songs;
       they DO sing cure songs”       b. animaru=tika        ururi          tua=tu
          animal-CER2         special.being spirit=AUG
        „The soul of the ururi (legendary creature) IS an animal‟       The marker =tika also combines with the negative particle tɨma. In these casesthe negative marker does not have scope over the proposition. On the contrary, thesequence tɨma-tika is translated into Amazonian Spanish as No pues/no es cierto? „Isn‟tit true?‟ and the resulting sentences get interpreted as rhetorical questions (cf. 32). In(32a), the proposition „woman throw blood monthly‟ is not negated but positivelyasserted. The discourse context for (32b) is this: a man sees someone and takes a guessthat is his son; then his wife clarifies that that is not their son by reminding him their
                                                 491
son went somewhere else. That is, in (32b) she not only asserts that „he went to theforest‟ but tɨmatika works as a reminder, implying that he knows that.
(32)   a. tɨma=tika ini                wayna=pura cada        yatsɨ

          1PL.IN         blood=FOC 1PL.IN           throw
         „Isn‟t it true we, women, each month we throw our blood?‟
          (No pues/no es verdad que cada mes las mujeres votamos nuestra sangre?)       b. temente      papa-isha;      tɨma=tika      ay      utsu=uy

         separate     forest 3SG.F=go=PAS1
        „There is not our son! Isn‟t it true he went, he went by himself to the forest?‟
        (No hay nuestro papito. No pues/no es verdad que él se fue por su cuenta al
       monte?)       The fact that =tin, =ti, and =tika are not only phonologically related but alsosemantically associated with strong assertions suggests a connection among them. Itcould be hypothesized, for instance, that the certainty marker =tin consists of -ti plus thenominalizer -n. At this point, however, this will have to remain as an untestablehypothesis.","[519, 520, 521]"

Crucial grammatical categories such as number, tense,modality, interrogation and focus are conveyed by clitics. The language has abouttwelve suffixes, only about four of which could be said show inflectional-like behavior.",[209]
"        The second part of this chapter is dedicated to the grammatical devices that thelanguage employs to perform different speech acts. In §9.2, I describe declarativesentences. I start with a formal characterization of the grammatical relations of subjectand object, and contrast them with obliques (§9.2.1), and then discuss the functionalload of declarative sentences (§9.2.2). From a semantic-functional perspective,negative clauses could be considered a subtype of declarative clauses; however, forreasons of clarity in the presentation, they are discussed in their own section (§9.3). In§9.4, I present interrogative sentences, including polar and content questions. Directivesentences, discussed in §9.5, is a category that subsumes several constructions,including imperative, polite imperative, exhortative, jussive, invitation, prohibition, andfuture/irrealis prohibition.",[493]
"        Another case when such a construction was given is when the speakers wereasked for negative proper inclusion like this:(12)    a. tɨma         maninpiara=ay
          NEG           hook=3SG.F

8.1.1.3. Left dislocated NP: [NPi, NP=Proi]        In a previous work, (Vallejos 2004), I described a pragmatically marked versionof the NP juxtaposition construction as left-dislocation. In this case, the fronted NP iscoreferential with an object pronoun. The structure of the construction is: [NPi, NP-Proi](10).(10)    a. joan         wayna=ay /=ura
           joan         woman=3SG.F/3SG.M

         „Jack is man‟ [Lit. Jack, man he is] (ED)        According to typological studies, left dislocation constructions are supposed tohave a separate intonation contour for the dislocated NP and a resumptive pronouncoreferential with the dislocated NP (Givon 2001:266). The elicited examples in (10)include an anaphoric pronoun, but the whole expression seems to occur under a singleintonational contour. However, a pause can be placed after the first NP, Joan (10a), andJack (10b).","[457, 458]"
"1995), KK exhibits grammaticalization of content words (e.g., auxiliaries,interrogatives, etc.), vast use of clitics to convey tense and modality, and minimalpresence of affixes.

"           With less frequency, the reverse order is also possible. That is, the nominalizedstative verb comes in first position followed by the NP.(22)       a. kuyana-n              tsa=mɨmɨrakunia

Attribute function via the purposive construction: [NP NP-ra]       There is a construction to indicate attribution that commonly receive futureinterpretation. The postposition of purpose =ra is attached to the second noun phrase(25). This construction is very productive and has a slightly specialized reading; itgenerally bears a sense of transformation, or „becoming.‟ If a tense clitic is not present,it has future reading; however, tense can be made explicit by attaching one of the cliticsto the predicate NP. Note the future marker =utsu (25b) and the past =tsuri(ay) in (25c).(25)   a. [amaniu    ts=uka         tsapɨtari      yatɨma-n]    [mutsana=ra]

       To negate this construction, tɨma shows up between the NP subject andpostpositional phrase (26). Note that tɨma cannot be sentence initial in (26), which isadditional evidence that the morpheme =ra is not the denominal verbalizer. In verbalpredicate constructions, tɨma in sentence initial position is the privileged pattern.(26)   a. ajan        tɨma tsa    mena=ra

Theexamples below show that the verbalizer generates denominal verbs out of nouns, witha completely different syntactic structure. Both examples exhibit SV structure; in (27a),the ra-derived verb is the main predicate of the clause; in (27b) the ra-derived verb iswithin a relative clause that is operating as the modifier of the subject „woman.‟(27)   a.

For instance, (106a), illustrates theinterrogation of the aspectual particle ay „already‟. Note that the particle appearsfronted, and what follows is a regular clause. That is: [PRT=tipa SUBJ V=T]. The textexample in (107a) is interesting because there is only a pronoun following themorpheme =tipa. This pronoun is understood as the theme. Note that the form of thepronoun is that of an object, as demonstrated by the elicited example in (107b), whichgives the corresponding male speech expression.","[567, 568]"
"As Lambrecht puts it, information structure is concerned with psychological phenomenasuch as the speaker‟s hypotheses about the hearer‟s mental states “only inasmuch asthey are reflected in grammatical structure.” (1994:3). It should be pointed out thatinformation structure differs from (conversational) pragmatics, in that the latter isconcerned with the interpretations of sentences that emerge from conversationalsettings. That is to say, “while conversational pragmatics is concerned with thequestion of why one and the same sentence form may express two or more meanings,discourse pragmatics is concerned with the question of why one and the same[propositional] meaning may be expressed by two or more sentence forms.” (Lambrecht1994:5). A basic claim of information structure is then that different constructions thatseem to be describing the “same” scene in a single language express different ways ofconceptualizing that scene. That is, different constructions appear to have a differentconceptual content (cf. also Croft 1993).",[698]
"      From a typological perspective, KK can be characterized as an isolating languagebecause words tend to be comprised of one morpheme, and morphemes can beidentified with particular meanings. As such, bare nominals and nominal modifiers arecommon. Because of reanalysis and grammaticalization processes, there are also a fewinstances were morpheme boundaries are not clear. On the other hand, considering thatKK uses order of constituents, specific grammatical words, and particles, rather thaninflection to express syntactic relations within sentences, it can also be characterized asanalytical.",[172]
"       A general characterization of tɨma is that its scope covers the (biggest)constituent that immediately follows it, including [SVO], [VO].

"From a functional perspective, this is not a coincidence: negation typically applies tosome piece of information concerning which there is some difference between theknowledge of the speaker and that of the addressee. As Givón points out, in negativeassertions, the speaker is not communicating new information to the hearer; rather he iscorrecting the hearer‟s misguided beliefs (Givón 2001:372). The morpheme =purainteracts with negation not only to correct the hearer‟s beliefs, but also to expresscorrection of the speaker‟s own former beliefs.",[735]
"In fact, KK has five postpositions that indicate different types of location and direction,several ways of indicating various aspectual nuances, six degrees of speaker-orientedmodality, two mechanisms of negation, etc. Overall, KK has a far more elaboratedgrammar than typical creoles; thus, categorizing KK solely in structural grounds —i.e.,in comparison with prototypical creoles— is problematic.",[784]

4.5.1.1. Plural       As introduced above, KK grammar displays some female speech vs. malespeech distinctions, one of them being differential number marking. Singular is theunmarked category, whereas plural is marked differently depending on whether thespeaker is a man or a woman. While men use the enclitic =kana (22), women use theform =nu (23). In terms of distribution, plural is conveyed via noun phrase particles thatappear appended to the last word of an NP, which is a noun or a nominalized verb.",[189]

As discussed above, while the distribution of -tara and -mira can be accountedfor on grammatical grounds, tsen-clauses cannot. More specifically, speakers have twochoices when they want to indicate purpose by means of adverbial clauses: -tara/miraclauses (whose distribution depends on the missing argument in the adverbial clause),and -tsen clauses. However, what triggers the speaker‟s choice seems to be too subtle tohave been adequately captured at this point in the analysis.",[659]
