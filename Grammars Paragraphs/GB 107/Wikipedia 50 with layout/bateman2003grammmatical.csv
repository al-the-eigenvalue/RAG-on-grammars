"10.2 Responses And Exclamations
Iau has a variety of particles used to indicate positive and negative responses. The following is a
list of positive response particles and their meanings.
    di⁴ to³ Yes, of course that's right.
    di⁴ y³ Yes, that's right.
    di⁴ da⁷by⁹ Yes, didn't you know that?
    di⁴ be⁷de⁷ to⁴ Yes, that must be right /Yes, that seems right.
    e⁸fe⁹ Yes, that's right.
    by⁷by⁹ That's true. /That's the way it is.
    ay⁸ Yes, I will; Yes, I understand; Okay
    dy⁴ dy³ Yes, you go ahead and do that.
The following is a list of negative response particles used in Iau and their meanings.
    Bai⁶e³ No, that's not right; No, I won't.
    Ba⁶⁻³ No; Well, actually....
    bav⁵ I don't know.
The final group of response particles listed below are used to express the speaker's feelings in
response to a given situation.
    Y⁶!`expresses displeasure'
    Y⁵! `expresses need to comply with speaker opinion /proposal'
    Ai⁶av²! `a lament, response to something negative'
    Y⁹v⁶ ` Oh!Oh! ('A⁹ bai⁸si⁷ to⁹’ I slipped/fell)
The exclamation y⁶! indicates displeasure over something that has happened. It is heard
frequently in the village when an owner returns to find that a dog has eaten his food, or when a
child has gotten into mischief. The speaker uses the particle y⁶ to announce and assert his
displeasure to the community at large.
 The exclamation particle y⁵ emphatically emphasizes the speaker's viewpoint or the need for the
action he is proposing. The following is an example taken from a conversation between a health
worker and a villager reporting to the health worker about a man with a bad cut.
    A. Fi⁴au⁷ di⁸ be⁹ y⁴.
        Intens hot is-TOT.PUN Info-SNC.NA.NDT
    Y⁵!                    Be⁸sy⁹ dv⁴ui⁹

    da⁸                ba⁷               ka⁷ dy³.
     carry-RES.DUR come-TOT.INC Emph Imp-RS.SA
    Well then lift him up and bring him (here).
By using the particle y⁵, the speaker indicates that the situation requires action. The speaker takes
control of the conversation by ending the discussion of symptoms and changing the discussion to
what should be done about the problem.",[126]
"The following is an example of tone 9 on a negative:
         Negative FACT: `did not, will not, is not, do not'
         Di⁹ to⁶ ba³tu³ sa⁸         ae⁹ ba³?
         2s Contr corn eat-RES.DUR Neg-FACT Uncer-RS.SA
         You do not eat corn do you?
The sentence about is a yes no question where the assumed answer is “No”. The negative
proposition “you do not eat corn” is viewed as fact by the speaker, as indicated by the tone 9
marking on the negative. The yes-no question particle gives the person the option of refuting or
clarifying the assumed fact.
Tone 9 can also occur on unbounded habitual or general truth statements
        Du⁹ bv⁸ i⁷           da⁸dv⁹  a⁷se⁹  kaf⁷

        When we go wild pig hunting, then we take along         a bow.",[46]
"    3.Bv⁷ to⁶     da⁷ da⁸                 ae⁵.
     this Contr dog RpSp-RES.DUR Neg-NP.FACT
     That is not called a dog. /That is not a dog.
    4. Ui⁷⁻⁸-de⁸ ae⁵.
      stand-stative neg
    He is not standing.
The first sentence above is an example of a simple negative statement, `The actor did not do x.'
The next two sentences, in addition to the negative particle ae also have the contradictory particle
to⁶ indicating that the speaker is contradicting or refuting previous information in the discourse.
The final sentence is an example of a negative negating a stative verb.
The addition of the status /epistemic modality tone morphemes to the negative particles
distinguishes eight different kinds of negatives in Iau. Each of these negative types is illustrated
in a sentence below.
    Tone 9
    Negative FACT: `did not, will not, is not, do not'
    Di⁹ to⁶ ba³tu³ sa⁸             ae⁹           ba³?
    2s Contr corn eat-RES.DUR Neg-FACT Uncer-RS.SA
    You do not eat corn do you?
    (See also example 1) in the previous set of examples)    Tone 3
    Negative REALIZATION: `didn't ever, hasn't ever'

    do that-TEL.INC DUBd-RLZ Inf-SNC.A.DT
    Since Benjamin hasn't ever seen a plane, he
    acted like that.",[38]
"9.9 Prohibitions
Prohibitions are negative commands. They command the hearer not to do something. In Iau
prohibitions are marked by two different particles that occur together, dy⁴sy⁷ meaning `shouldn't'
and day³ meaning `negative command'. The following prohibition is an example.
    Di⁹ dy⁴sy⁷ i⁷            day³.
    2s shldnt go-TOT.INC Prohib
    Don't go! /You shouldn't go!
Iau also has statements which are used as indirect prohibitions. These statements are marked by a
contrary to desire particle fe in Iau. The negative obligation particle dy⁴sy⁷ `shouldn't' can also be
used in these statements. The following are some examples.",[120]
"The negative particle with a tone 6 means `there is or there are none'. In the negative statement
above, tone 6 indicates that the proposition `She has no children' is an immediate fact, ie a fact
at speech time.
Tone 6 only occurs on the negative particle. Although tone 6 immediate/current reality only
occurs on negatives. It does occur on a several temporal adverbs which all have to do with the
current temporal status or the previous situation. It seems that on these particles the tone has a
similar meaning a current immediate situation.
       da⁶ now
       u⁶ before now
       i⁶ now for a short time (‘I⁶ bv⁸ bai⁷ de⁸ dy³’ means wait a minute /Iwill be right with you.)
                                                                                                       47
Tones Viewing An Unrealized Proposition As Possible or Hypothetically Possible (7,4)
Both tones, 7 and 4 view the action as unrealized.","[47, 48]"
"On negative particles, tone 7 ‘hypothetical’ means “could have been, but wasn’t, or never would
be. The following is an example.
        Ty⁷ bi⁷si⁹     di⁹ di⁸          ai⁷    di⁸  y⁹
        person one     2s kill-RES.DUR Neg-HYP Pbd-RLZ Nomin        by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ di⁹ o⁷       di⁷ y³.

        If you had not killed that person, then you could have taken me (as wife).",[48]
"Tone 5 meaning non-present fact, also occurs frequently on negatives as a emphatic contrastive
negative. that is is not at all, didn’t at all ,
       Ba⁶⁻³ y⁸ to⁶ a²        i⁷           ae⁵.

       No, we did not (emphatic contrastive) go by land at all.",[47]
"
5.1.3.1 Negatives
Negatives in Iau are marked either by the particle ’ae’ ‘state of non-existence”. or the particle
‘ai’ ‘(cause) become or irrealis non existent’. These particles immediately follow the verb or the
verb and the clitic stative particle if present. The following are some examples.
    1.Y⁸ bui²    i⁷           ai⁹      y⁴.
     1p upstream go-TOT.INC Neg-FACT Inf-SNC.NA.NDT
     We didn't /never did go upstream.
    2.A⁹ to⁶      i⁷      ae⁵.
     1s Contr go-TOT.INC Neg-NPFACT
     I did not go at all.",[38]
"The particle da³ indicates that the speaker feels the proposition was a given/known, and in
combination with the negative ae⁷ means it should never should have been a reality.
    A⁹ te⁷bv⁹ bv⁸ bei⁸           ae⁷       da³?
    1S why for stop-RES.DUR Neg-HYP Given RS.SA
    Why didn't I remember? (Lit. stop on something)/ I knew it. I should have remembered.",[45]
"
                                                                                                  50
Tone 2
Tone 2 occurs only on the negative particle in a specialized circumstance marking a
contraexpectation.
       Dy⁸ a⁴ av⁴       bv⁸ av⁸           ae²
       then father Poss to refuse-RES.DUR Neg-NPresRLZ       di⁹ ti²              be³?
       2s give-TEL.DUR Uncer-RS.SA
       So then, did her father not/without refusing, give her to      you? (as wife)5.1.3.3 Illocutionary Force
The final particles in Iau verb phrase are deontic modality particles which express mood and
illocutionary force.
 Deontic Intensifier+T² Deontic Modality+T³                     Eviden+T³ Sent

                        y, An Answer, Opinion, Statement
The segmental mood particles that fill the mood/illocutionary force slot in Iau are used to
indicate the speakers intention regarding the information role of his proposition in the
conversational discourse.They have to do with speaker hearer relationship and intent towards
each other as well as the content of the proposition expressed. The intent may be to convey
information, opinion or assert a fact. It may be to ask for information or it may be to obligate
either speaker or hearer to action. A promise or statement of intent is used by the speakers to
obligate themselves. A command with various levels of mitigation of that command is an attempt
by the speaker to obligate the hearer. Following the mood slot is a slot used by the speaker to
convey that the information is or should be already known to the hearer. It is in effect an
intensifier of the command, promise or statement being made.","[50, 51]"
"    Tone 5
    Negative NONPRESENT FACT: `is not at all, didn't at all',
    emphatic contrastive negative.

"6.1.2.1 POST-NUCLEAR CORE SLOTS
Note in the chart above that there are two core slots following the clause nucleus, negative and
modality particles. These have been discussed previously in the section on Verb Phrases 5.1.
Some examples are given below.",[73]
"    Tone 7
    Negative HYPOTHETICAL: `could have been but wasn't,

    could have taken me (as wife).",[38]
"5.1.3.2 Epistemic Modality:Status and Evidential Particles
Epistemic modality is a sub-type of linguistic modality that deals with a speaker's
evaluation/judgment of, degree of confidence in, or belief in the knowledge upon which a
proposition is based. In other words, epistemic modality refers to the way speakers communicate
their doubts, certainties, and guesses—their ""modes of knowing"".

that a slot for evidential particles. These particles comment on realis properties of the marked
event, the characteristics and degree of definiteness of it’s occurrence, mark the speakers
evaluation of its truth and relationship to common knowledge.
The following are some examples.
    Y⁸    a⁷se⁹        taui⁷   di³.

"Finally,the example below shows the tone 8 morpheme on a negative particle, meaning the lack

"The non-present orientation of tone 5 enables it to act as an emphatic contrary to expectation on
negatives. The speaker here is refuting a wrong assumption for the other speakers in the
conversation.
The following example is of tone 5 on the di particle. It marks the totally bounded definite event
as not true at present.

6.1 Constituents Of Iau Clauses10
The layered clause structure presented in Van Valin (1993) is a helpful model for discussing
clause constituents and their ordering in Iau. In Van Valin's model, the clause constituents are
defined semantically rather than grammatically. The clause consists of three layers, nucleus, core
and periphery. Each layer is separated from the others by operators. The operators are particles
carrying grammatical categories such as aspect, modality, directionals, negation, evidentials and
mood . The operators are juxtaposed to the clause level constituents they modify or operate on.
For example nuclear operators are located at boundaries between nuclear and core constituents.
Likewise core operators are located at boundaries between core and peripheral constituents, and
peripheral operators are located at the clause periphery. Each of the three clause layers and their
operators will be discussed below.",[71]
"Over the period of time that the addressees were in that place, they ate a number of times, thus
the progressive realization tone morpheme 3.
In the situation below, Bemjamin who never before had an experience in a plane has now had
one. The speakers are discussing his reaction to his first ride. The negative particle with a tone 3
progressive realization morpheme means (before this) had not ever, did not ever.",[49]

1.0 INTRODUCTION2
Iau3 is a Papuan language spoken by over 1500 speakers who live along the Van Daalan River, a
southern branch of the Tariku /Rouffaer River in the Western Lakes Plains area. They are located
in the District of Fawi, Puncak Jaya Regency, Papua, Indonesia. (Ethnologue). GPS coordinates
for the main village of Fawi are: 03 13.86S 137 43.56E
The Lakes Plains Languages were originally grouped with the Tor languages to the northeast as
part of the Trans New Guinea Languages (Wurm 1982, Voorhoeve 1975), but more recently with
the Geelvink/Cenderawasih Bay Languages such as Bauzi, Tunggare, and Burate (Clouse,
1997), And by some as an independent family (Ross 2005, Usher ) (See also Wikipedia).
The Iau dialect trio of Iau, Turu, and Foi along with Edopi are classified by Usher (2018) as
West Tariku4 languages as opposed to the Wapoga River, Central and Duvle-East languages.
The Glottologue makes the Tariku (River) languages into a broader grouping, which includes
East Tariku, Central Tariku, Duvle and West Tariku. In this classification Iau and the other 2
dialecs are classed as Central Tariku. Iau is also classified as a Central Tariku lanugage in
Clouse’s classification of Tariku (1997) which consists of six families—Tause, West Tariku,
Central Tariku. East Tariku, Duvle and West Lakes Plains.","[1, 2, 3]"
"6.0 LAYERED CLAUSE STRUCTURE: NUCLEUS, CORE, PERIPHERY
Words and particles combine to form phrases. Words and phrases combine to form clauses.
Clauses like phrases have language specific structure.
Clauses in various languages are sometimes classified on the basis of verb types such as stative,
equative, intransitive, transitive and bitransitive. The classification of Iau clauses on the basis of
verb types, is not a very helpful classification, since Iau verb stems do not have inherent lexical
transitivity. The following are some examples of clauses varying in transitivity but using the
same verb.
        BE =be in or on a place
                          NP ADJ              V

"
A tone 2 telic durative is substituted for a tone 5 telic punctual aspect when the action is in
process moving towards its endpoint. The following is a example.
       U⁸ a⁷se⁹ tai-5.          VS Ty⁷da⁷y³ u⁸ tai²       da⁸dv⁹

In cases where a telic verb is paired with a particle requiring irrealis such as an intention
statement, tone 4 telic incompletive is substituted for the punctual form 5. But in addition, 7
totality of action incompletive must also be added forming the tone cluster ⁴⁻⁷. The verb foi⁵ ‘tell
/ask’ is a telic completive verb.

Tone Class Resultative Verbs (6)
The resultative punctual tone, forms the last class of Iau verbs. The resultative verbs focus on the
result of an action. They are inherently undergoer or experiencer focus, as illustrated by the
following examples:
       di⁶ get /be startled
       bai⁶ beach /put to shore (a canoe)
       e⁶ to exclaim,cry out
       (a⁵) tai⁶ touchdown!/has landed (plane)
       bav⁶ wither and die (plant)
       kavy⁶ wiggle/move (eg a rock)
These verbs do not have any other variant tone in their class. Whether in combination with
various epistemic and deontic modal particles, and negatives, and in medial verb clauses as well
as main clauses, their tone does not change. They view the action as punctual and resultative.

Tone Class Variant Summary
The variant forms in each class (7,8,4,2) are found in main clauses when negatives or the various
deontic and epistemic modal particles occur, as illustrated below by tones 7,4 and 8 occurring
with a question particle, a negative and an imperative.

       Because we might get wet from the rain, sew some roof thatching.
The variant forms also occur in medial verb clauses and some subordinate verb clauses. In the
examples below tone 7 Tot.Inc substitutes for tone 9 Tot.Pun. Tone 8 Rslt.Dur substitutes for
tone 3 Rslt.Pun. And tone 4 Tel.Inc substitutes for tone 5 Tel.Pun.

"9.2 Commands In Iau
Commands are one of a class of utterances used to get the hearer to do something for the
speaker. Requests, wishes, desires, suggestions, and prohibitions are examples of other kinds of
utterances that are used to express what the speaker wants the hearer to do in a less direct way
(mitigated commands). These utterances all differ in the degree of obligation that the speaker
places on the hearer. Iau has several different kinds of particles and tone morphemes that are
used to express varying degrees of obligation. Each of the different types of commands will be
discussed and illustrated individually below.",[117]
"6.1.5 THE SPACERS
As shown in the sections on the LDP above, each LDP can be followed by a spacer, a pause, or a
potential pause. Most of the examples of spacers in the preceeding sections have been with the
sequence marking particle a⁷se⁹. But other core markers are also used in the spacer slot.
The following are used as spacers in Iau.
       Modality Markers:
            sy⁹ Obligation
            dy⁴sy⁷ (+Mood day³) Prohibition, shouldn't do it

In addition to it's spacer function and topic introducing function, the a⁷se⁹ particle is used in Iau
in discourse to mark events that are in a sequential relationship either to each other or to the time
of speaking as illustrated in the following examples.
       Sequence Example 1
         Di⁹ _a⁷se⁹_ taui⁷ di⁸ ba³?
         you SqMkr make Bd ?Mkr
         Have you _already_ made it?","[83, 84]"
"
9.1.1 Yes-No Questions in Iau
Yes-no questions are formed in Iau by adding a yes-no question marker be or ba, which can be
used interchangeably, and by changing the tone on the verb stem according to the verb class
requirements.. In the example below, the first sentence is a simple statement. The second
sentence is a yes-no question formed from this statement.
    1.Au⁷ du⁹     bv⁸ i⁹.
     he wild pig for go
    He went hunting. (Lit. He went to get a wild pig.)
    2.Au⁷ du⁹     bv⁸ i⁷ ba³?
     he wild pig for go ?-Uncertain
    Did he go hunting?
The bolded words in the second sentence above illustrate the changes used in Iau to form a yes-
no question. The question marker ba³ is added to indicate that the speaker thinks it is true that the
man has gone hunting, but he is not sure. The example above also illustrates how the tone is
changed on tone 9 verbs in yes-no questions. A tone 9 (high level tone) is changed to a tone 7
(high rising tone). In the sentences above i⁹ becomes i⁷.
 The following pairs of sentences show the tone changes for tone 3 verbs and tone 5 verbs. The
tone 3, low falling tone, is changed to a tone 8, low level tone. A tone 5 high low falling tone is
changed to a tone 4 high falling verb in the question form.
    1. Tone 3 change to tone 8
    Au⁷ fv⁷ da⁸ du³.
    he plane carry go along
    He flies the plane.
    Au⁷ fv⁷    da⁸ du⁸         ba³?
    he plane carry go along ?-Uncertain
    Does he fly the plane?",[110]
"2.5 Words
Words are the smallest units of speech that can be spoken with meaning in isolation. They are
potentially bounded by pause, and can written bounded by a space. Words in Iau like other
languages are of 5 basic types, nouns (people, places, things, or names), verbs, adverbs,
adjectives, and free standing grammatical particles or markings indicating relationships of
grammatical units with each other.",[9]

"The Mood Tone Morphemes
The illocutionary force of an utterance can be defined as the speech act that is performed by
uttering a given proposition. Lyons (1977:745) lists statements, commands and questions as
examples of utterances with differing illocutionary force. The illocutionary force of an utterance
in Iau is indicated by a combination of grammatical devices including modality particles,
sentence final segmental mood particles and the tone morphemes that occur on them.
 We have seen in the previous section that the Iau segmental mood particles indicate the intended
illocutionary force of the proposition. One set of particles marks sentences that give information
to the hearer. Another set of particles marks sentences whose role is to elicit a response from the
hearer.
 The tone morphemes which are superimposed on these segmental particles mark the dynamics
of the interchange between speaker and hearer. The tone morphemes indicate whether the
speaker is asserting the information as nuclear /core information about the discourse topic or not.
They also indicate which speaker in the conversation is controlling the discourse topic and the
flow of information about discourse topic. The tone morphemes on Iau mood particles have
differing meanings depending on the illocutionary force of the sentence on which they occur. In
the following sections we will discuss the meanings of the tone morphemes on Yes-No Question
Markers. Then we will discuss the meanings of the tone morphemes on directives. And finally
we will discuss the meanings of the tone morphemes on statements.
The tone morphemes on the mood particles indicate the illocutionary force of the utterance, ie
how much response the speaker expects from the hearer and how forceful and immediate the
requirement is.
The following lists the illocutionary force meanings of the tone morphemes on these particles.
    3 =Assertive, expects response /or responding to previous speaker (RsA)
    8 =Assertive, expects /needs immediate response (IRsA)
    9 =Assertive, but does not expect response (NRsA)
    5 =Assertive, but expects hearer resistance, both hearer and
      speaker obligation (SHRsA)
    4 =Non-assertive, but expects response (RsNA)
    7 =Non-assertive, does not expect response or compliance (NRsNA)The following are some examples..",[55]
"In an unmarked information structure, the verb and it's arguments are being asserted about a
topical noun /noun phrase. The verb phrase is the head of the focus structure and is located in the
comment part of the clause. In an unmarked predicate focus clause in Iau, nouns are unmarked.",[85]

Epistemic Tone Morphemes
The set of epistemic tone morphemes in Iau view the temporal and realis occurrence conditions
of the verbal situation and evaluate it according to degrees of factiveness or realization. They
also comment on the temporal characteristics of that reality, These same status morphemes occur
on stative, negative, modality, status and evidential particles.

                  Meaning of Tone Morphemes on Statement Mood Particles
Tone 9 in the first column of the chart above indicates that the Speaker considers himself to be
the participnt controlling the discourse topic and the information about discourse topic.
Furthurmore, tone 9 on a statement mood particle indicates that the speaker is asserting the
information as nuclear or core information about the discourse topic.
 Statements marked by tone 9 are used in conversational discourse on answers that challenge the
information content of the question or answers that assert the speakers control of information
unknown to the hearer. The following sentence is an example.
     Dy⁴ so⁶      to⁷ba⁷    de⁹?
     then child how many Sta-FACT
     Spkr 1 And how many children does he have?
     So⁶ ai⁶                 y⁹.
     child Neg-RES.DUR Info-SC.A.DT
     He has no children.
In the example above, Speaker B uses a tone 9 on the statement mood particle y to indicate that
he intends to challenge the basic assumption of Speaker A and assert contrastive information
about the discourse topic.
 In contrast to tone 9 in the first column of the chart above, tones 3 and 8 in the second column
indicate that the speaker does not control discourse topic or the flow of information about
discourse topic. The information content of the statement, however, is being asserted about
discourse topic. Most answers to questions in Iau are marked by a tone 3 on the statement mood
particle as illustrated by the following example.
     Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶      ba⁷               ba³?
     plane tomorrow come-TOT.INC ?Mkr-PI
     Spkr 1Is the plane coming tomorrow?
     Di⁹y³. Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶ ba⁹                 a⁹         y³.
     yes plane tomorrow come-TOT.PUN DUbd-FACT Info-SNC.A.DT
     Spkr 2 Yes, the plane is coming tomorrow.
In the example above Speaker 1 marks hi2answer to Speaker A's question with a noncontrolling
tone 3 morpheme. The tone 3 morpheme indicates that while Speaker 2 is asserting the
information in the statement about discourse topic, he is not the participant who is controlling
discourse topic or the flow of information about discourse topic. He is responding to Speaker 1
by providing the requested information.
Tone 3 morphemes can also be used on statements that give furthur information on an already
introduced topic as illustrated in the following example.
    Ay⁸ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ fv⁷ doe⁷             ae³       se⁹

    Yes, since Benjamin had never seen a plane before, he acted like that.","[58, 59]"
"9.5 Wishes and Desires
Wishes and desires in Iau are statements that the speaker makes informing the hearer of his
desire. The speaker would like the hearer to fulfill his desire but puts no oligation on him. There
are two different forms that Iau speakers use to express desire. These are illustrated below.
     1. A⁹ da⁸bu⁸ sa⁸               fo⁹    a⁹             y⁹.
        1s squash eat-RES.DUR Desire DUbd-FACT Info-SC.ADT
     I want to eat some squash.
     2. A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷             se⁴     di⁴du⁷be⁷ di⁴               y³.
         1s book see-TOT.INC Inten but               happen- URLZ Info-SNC.ADT
     I intend to look at books but maybe it won't happen. (ie you may not be willing to let me)
The first example above uses the particle fo which means `to want to' to express desire. The tone
9 on the final particle y⁹ indicates that the speaker is using his statement to control the
conversation and the hearer with his statement. That is he wants to talk to the hearer about his
desire for squash and he wants the hearer to help him fulfull his desire.
The second example is an example of a statement of desire which is used in a situation where the
speaker feels the hearer may not be willing to fulfill his desire.",[119]
"The participants in the conversation above are discussing the marriage status of various people in
the village. Speaker 2 is surprised that a certain girl is still unmarried. Speaker 1 explains that
their custom is to wait until the girls are a little older. Speaker 2 in the sentnece above then offers
a contrastive statement that in his village, the girl would have already been married. The
contrastive statement giving furthur information is marked by tone 9.
The tone 8 morpheme is also speaker non controlling. In addition, the tone 8 morpheme indicates
that the information in the proposition is of immediate contextual relevence. The following
sentence is an example.
     A⁹ a⁵ taui⁷               sa⁹        y⁸.
      1S land work-TOT.INC Int-FACT Info-SNC.A.CR
     I am going now to work in my garden.
The sentence above is taken from a conversation about what each participant is doing. The
example above is the answer to the question, `What are you going to do?' In the discourse
context, the speaker is on his way to the garden. The information in the statement is of
immediate relevence in the discourse situation since the speaker is currently engaged in bringing
the action about.
 The tones in the final column of the chart above, tones 7 and 4, are also speaker noncontrolling.
Tones 7 and 4 also tend to mark responses such as answers and furthur remarks or opinions.
Tones 7 and 4 contrast in that tone 7 marks statements whose information content is directly
about the discourse topic while tone 4 marks statements when the information is not directly
about the discourse topic.
The following is an example of a tone 7 morpheme on a statement.
    So⁷ fi⁴au⁷ be⁸ be⁹?
    tree Inten tall ?Mkr-NI
    Spkr 1And the So tree very tall?
     BY⁶! to²⁻⁷ ae⁷.                               Ba⁹ tv⁹                   dv⁹ y⁷?
     Exclam do what-TEL.DUR.CHS Neg-HYP here go away-TOT.PUN (?) Info-SNC.NA.DT
     Spkr 2 You are not kidding! It was way up there!
Many occurrences of tone 7, like the example above, are on highly idiomatic verb phrases. The
question mark glossing the particle dv is used to indicate that the exact meaning of the particle is
unknown. The general meaning of the statements is clear from the context and discussions with
native speakers. In the example above, the speaker is giving a highly emotive response to
Speaker 1's question. Speaker 2 uses the tone 7 morpheme to indicate that the fact that the tree
was tall should not even have been called into question.
 Tone 4 morphemes mark statements that have backgrounding functions in the discourse. The
information content of the statement marked by tone 4 is peripheral not nuclear to the discourse
topic, ie it is not directly related to the discourse topic. The following example illustrates tone 4
marking information that is not directly about the discourse topic.",[60]
"Tone changes on postpositions
There are tone changes on the postpositions ta⁹ ‘in’ and foe⁴ ‘next to, near, at the edge of’.The
following are examples of a tone change from the unmarked foe⁴ to foe⁴⁻⁷.
         So⁶      ko⁴du⁸   bi⁷si⁹    ty³fo³   av⁷bv⁹   a⁷se⁹ … toe⁴         da⁸dv⁹

       People who are big like that (/like him), it would be good for them to kill /shoot wild pigs
       from far away. It’s the small people (young (nimble) boys) who it’s alright to shoot them
       from right next to them /close up.
In examples 1-4 above the postposition foe⁴ is marked with a tone 4. In example 5 the tone
changes from 4 to 4-7. This example is made up of two contrastive sentences. Full grown men
are contrasted with boys in the way it is advisable for them to shoot at pigs. Both contrastive
manners are marked with tone 7. The word for ‘far away’ davy⁷ is normally davy⁸. Davy⁷ di⁸
‘shooting from far away’is contrasted with foe⁴⁻⁷ di⁸ ‘shooting from close up.’ The function of
the tone 7 here is something like the function of the be particle which marks nouns as the new
information being predicated by the clause.
The postpostition ta⁷ normally has a tone 7 on it and fills the postpostion slot phrase final.
However, when the noun phrase is part of a clause with a stative locative verb, the postpostion
ta⁷ changes to ta⁹ and becomes a clitic attached to a verb or adverb.
       1. Y⁸ a⁷se⁹ y⁷        ta⁷ du³.

resultative and telic viewpoints. In addition, the durative aspect on the top center of the chart
sometimes results in different lexical meanings.
The four lexical aspect morphemes Totality of Action Punctual and Durative, Telic and
Resultative divide Iau verbs into 4 aspectual tone classes. The four classes are shown above.
Each class except Resultative has one or more grammatical variants.
      Totality Of Actions Events have a punctual form –tone⁹ and an incompletive/irrealis form
       tone 7.
      Totality of Action Process verbs have a process form –tone 3 and a resultative durative
       form, tone 8.
      Telic Verbs have a punctual form, tone 5, a incompletive form—tone 4 and a durative
       process form –tone 2.
      Resultative Verbs have only one form—tone 6 Resultative-Punctual.
The punctual forms (9,6,5) along with the totality of action durative form (3) are used to assert
occurrence and assert as fact.
The durative and incompletive forms (7,4,8,2) are used in grammatical contexts that require
irrealis, completive, durative or resultative forms.","[20, 21]"
"The example above is taken from a procedural text. The cleft construction /narrow focus marker
by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ marks the two kinds of wood as being the main thing the speaker is asserting about
the topic, making a wooden dish. The narrow focus marker by⁷by⁹ du⁷be⁷ is a more emphatic
form of the narrow focus marker du⁷be⁷. The examples above represent the reverse of the topic -
comment clause structure. In the examples above, the LDP is focus and the remainder of the
clause is presupposition. The tone on the narrow focus markers varies with the relationship
between the focus noun and the presupposition predicate. A narrow focus marker with a tone 4,
du⁷be⁴, is used to indicate a means relationship between focus information and the information in
the clause.

goes along the surface of the tree it's then when).
This illustrates that the force of the Iau narrow focus marker is to mark only one element of the
information structure as being asserted about the topic, in contrast to predicate focus in which the
entire predicate verb and associated information is being asserted.","[90, 91]"

"3.1.3.2 Grammatical Aspect and the Iau Tone Morphemes
Grammatical aspect is used to show the relationship of actions and states to time and to the
other events in the context. Grammatical aspect signals the temporal viewpoint of the event such
as punctual/perfective (as single unit), durative/imperfective (occurs over extended period of
time, overlapping, repetitive, gnomic or generic truth statements and the like) as well as various
                                                                                                   19
temporal aspects of the event like inceptive, incompletive /interrupted etc. Grammatical aspect
is governed by the grammatical context.
                    Punctual/Perfective      Durative/Imperfective       Incompletive
Totality Of          9                                                   7

Punctual aspect sees the action simply as something that happens or has happened. This is the
aspect used most often in chains of actions related by cause-effect or chronological sequence.
Each action is seen as a unit or point in time or on an eventline. It other kinds of discourse it is
used on statements of fact and assertions. The three punctual aspects are totality of action,
resultative events and telic events. Punctual-Totality of Action viewpoint aspect is often referred
to as PERFECTIVE aspect.
Durative aspect sees the event as a process or extended action occurring over time. The
linguistic terms progressive, continuative, durative, and repetitive /iterative all refer to actions
occuring over an extended period of time, often overlapping with other events and occuring
multiple times, but number and time of occurrence is indefinite. The three durative aspects are
totality of action, resultative events and telic processes and events. Durative aspect verbs are
often referred to as IMPERFECTIVE verbs.
Incompletive aspectual viewpoints view the action as incomplete in some way. Inceptive
viewpoints view the action as just beginning (began to, started to). Incompletive verbs can
include interrputed, or postponed actions. Or they can have no definite ending.
In Iau events that are planned, but not yet executed, about to begin but not yet, also have an
incompletive aspectual viewpoint as well as discussions of events as possible or probable. Using
incompletive aspect the Iau can discuss hypothetical events as well. These events are irrealis
(never happened) but are being viewed as if they had happened or will happen. There are only
two incompletive aspects in Iau, totality of action and telic action.
This is summarized in the following chart:                                 GRAMMATICAL ASPECT

3.1.3.3 Tone Classes And Their Grammatical Variants
Sections 3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.2 dealt with the issues of semantic aspect viewpoints of an event
realized in the languages lexicon and grammatical aspect in Iau. As stated in the opening to
3.1.3.1, another way of looking at the Iau aspect tone morphemes is to use the tone morphemes
to divide Iau verbs into lexical classes. This would divide Iau verbs into tone classes.
In the tone aspect morpheme chart below, there are four of the basic aspects that often result in
different lexical meanings.","[19, 20]"
"10.1.2 Tone 3: Speaker Responding
A tone 3 on a statement particle indicates that the speaker is not trying to control the information
about the topic. The tone 3 occurs frequently on answers to questions. The speaker uses the tone
3 to indicate that he is not trying to control the conversation but is responding with the requested
information. The use of a tone 3 also indicates that the information in the statement is about the
topic. The following sentence is an example.
     A. Fv⁷      da⁸su⁶    ba⁷                ba³?
         plane tomorrow come-TOT.INC ?Mkr-PI
     Is the plane coming tomorrow?
     B. Di⁹y³. Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶ ba⁹ a⁹                            y³
      yes plane tomorrow come-TOT.PUN DUbd-FACT Info-SNC.A.DT
     Yes, the plane is coming tomorrow.
In the example above, the second speaker marks his answer to the question with a tone 3 to
indicate that it is a response to the first speaker's lead.
A tone 3 is also used on statement particles to mark additional comments that a speaker may
want to make on an already introduced topic. The following statement is an example.
    Ay⁸ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ fv⁷ doe⁷               ae³      se⁹         dy⁴    a³             y³.

The statement above is an excerpt from a conversation about riding in a plane for the first time.
The speaker is offering the statement above as an additional comment on the topic of how
Benjamin reacted to the plane ride.",[125]
"9.3 Statements
Statements in Iau that convey information to the speaker can be marked by a number of sentence
final particles that indicate the speaker's attitude toward the information content of the sentence.
The following is a list of the Iau statement marking particles.
       y      an answer, opinion, observation, announcement
       iy     speaker is an expert, hearer is ignorant
                                                                                                  120
       to     information is being used to refute or contradict the hearer
       e      information is being used to explain or justify another statement
       by       information in the sentence is a prediction speculation or recommendation based
                on knowledge or experience
        ba /be     probable or possibly true information
The statement particle y is the most commonly occuring statement particle in Iau. The particle y
marks answers, opinions, observations, comments, announcements, and statements of wishes or
desires. The following are some examples.
    1A. Di⁹ te⁷bv⁸ i⁹              a³?
        2s what for go-TOT.PUN MUbd-RLZ
        What are you going to get?

     2. Si⁶    au⁷sy⁹ av⁸be⁸day⁸ te⁷ fv²                a⁹             y³.
      woman ours        quickly man tie to-TEL.DUR MUbd-FACT Info-SNC.ADT
     Our women quickly get married (ie marry young).
The particle iy is used when the speaker feels that he has expert or `inside' knowledge in contrast
to the hearer who is ignorant on the subject. The following sentence is an example.
    Ba⁶⁻³ da⁶ a⁷se⁹     bv⁸ bai⁴de⁷        da⁸dv⁹ te⁷
     Well now SeqMkr for wait-Sta-HYP MVbCj man
    te⁷    fv²              a⁹            be⁴          iy³.
    Man tie to-TEL.DUR MUbd-FACT is-TEL.INC InfoU-SNC.ADT
    Well, our (women) wait and then (later) they are married.
The example above is taken from the same conversation as the previous example. The first
speaker has given information about marriage customs in his culture. The following speaker
gives information about a contrastive custom and indicates that this is contrastive inside
knowledge as compared with what the hearer knows by using the particle iy.
The particle to in Iau is used to indicate that the speaker is using the information in the sentence
to contradict the hearer in some way or he is expressing surprise or shock. The following are
some examples.
     1.Bv⁷ te⁷ ae⁶           to⁹.
      this man Neg-FACT RHr-SC.ADT
     She has no husband!
     2.Ai⁶av²! Dy⁴ so⁶ av⁷bv⁹ bv⁸ fe⁷su⁷          to⁴.
      Exclam then child his       for feel pity RHr-SNC.NA.NDT
     That's too bad! I'm shocked and sorry for his children.
In the first example above, the speaker is contradicting the previous speaker's assumption that the
woman is married. The particle to indicates that she is not just informing the hearer that the
woman is not married but is also indicating that the previous speakers question is not relevant
because the assumption on which it was based is wrong. The second example illustrates the use
of the particle to to indicate that the speaker is shocked or surprised by the news he has heard.
The Iau particle e is used to indicate that the speaker is using the statement to justify or explain
his action. The following conversational excerpt illustrates the use of this particle.
    A.Di⁹ to⁶ ba³tu³ sa⁸               ae⁹        be³?
        2s Cntr corn eat-RES.DUR Neg-FACT ?Mkr

Status particles as discussed in the section above in 5.2 on Iau Verb Phrases, mark the situation
as realis vs irrealis and also indicate the degree of temporal boundedness.
The evidential particle da illustrated in example 28 above, indicates that the speaker feels the
hearer knows or should know the information content of the utterance. In example 25 it marks
the generally known expectation, that the man was going to leave, which was never actually
realized.
The mood particles in Iau indicate the communicative function of the utterance and the degree to
which the speaker is asserting the utterance. See the section on Iau Verb phrases 5.1 above for
more information.","[76, 77]"
"Tone 4
Tone 4 marks and unrealized action as pending. It is viewed as about to be fulfilled. This comes
out in various ways when combined with various post verbal particles.
This following sentence repeated from above, illustrates the use of a tone 4 epistemic modality
marker on an intention particle to mean “about to”
       Di⁹y³, to⁸ bv⁶ di⁷               se⁴         dy⁵ .

9.2.1 Who /”Ty⁷⁻⁸’: questions about identity
Who questions are used when the normal focus item in the clause, the event, is known, but the
identity of the actor or agent for that event is unknown. The question word becomes the new
focus information about the topic, the rest of the clause.
There are two main `who' compound question words in Iau.
       ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴
       who? person identity marker
       ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
       who? agent as focus/new unknown information
 The word ‘boe⁴’ (identity marker) used in the example below is in a topic as predicate focus
type sentence where the new predicated information is on the left side of the clause and marked
by ‘du⁷be⁷’.
    Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³?       Si⁸a⁸da³ boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³.
     who ID that came           Janet ID Mkr that arrive
    Who is it that came? It's Janet that arrived.
    Ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴     du⁷be⁷ dui⁹       da⁹?      Epi boe⁴     du⁷be⁷ dui⁹    da⁹.
     who ID Mkr that w.pig-by bitten Epi Iden Mkr that w.pig-by bitten
    It was Epi who was bitten by a wild pig.
The question word with the boe⁴ identity particle can also be used when the `who' question word
occurs in the normal predicate position as illustrated below.
     Ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴?
      this who     ID mkr
     Who is this?
     A⁹ boe⁴ y³.
      I Iden Mkr Statement Mkr
     It's me.
As indicated above, the question word ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ `who' and the
identity marker boe⁴. The particle boe⁴ is used to mark statements of personal identity. The use of
the personal identity marker boe is also used to mark the identity information in the answers to
the questions in the illustrations above.
The question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ and the noun marker be⁸. Be⁸
marks nouns or noun phrases within the clause when they are focus, predicated information. The
tone morpheme 8 marks them as causative agent The following is an example of the use of the
content question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸.
     Da⁷ ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸           di³?
     This dog, who NMkFocus/Ag killed (it)?
     Who killed this dog?
In the question above the question word `who' uses the noun marker be⁸ because the person the
speaker wants to know about is also the one who brought about the action. That is the speaker
wants to know who acted on the dog and brought about his death.","[111, 112]"
"3.1.2 Iau Segmental Verb Roots
In an article about Kalam, a Papuan language with a closed set of 90 verbs, Pawley (1987:336-
338) says these 90 verbs are composed of fewer than 30 verb roots, all having very broad or
abstract meanings. These verb roots are strung together in serial verb constructions to comprise
90% of all verbs occuring in Kalam texts. In Kalam, these strings of generic verbs are used to
indicate lexically complex events such as `hunt', `carry', `send to jail'. There are also many
ongoing studies in Southeast Asia concerning the phenomena7 of “complex verbs”, light or
vector verbs, serial verbs etc.
In Iau, monosyllabic segmental verb stems likewise seem to be composed of strings of consonant
and vowel root morphemes which combine to form stems with broad abstract meanings that are
furthur defined from context, from number of arguments for the predicate in the context, and also
by the aspect of the super-imposed aspect tone morphemes. This is illustrated by Iau verbs
formed with the consonant “b”below.
    ‘b’ Motion towards and reaching /acting on a goal /location
    Some of the Iau verbs built from the root“b” +vowel
    ba³ to come (process); to shoot, kill, throw at (a rock at someone)
    ba⁹ come
    be⁹ to paint
    bi³ to arrive
    baui³ to arrive at /reach
    ba⁶ to come to
    da⁸ba⁶ to bring to
    bai⁶ beach /dock a canoe
    bae⁵(sun /light) shine in on
    bu⁵ burn down
    bui⁵ cut down (tree)
    bo⁵ act of moving to a sitting /squatting position on the ground
    boe⁵to lower into a hole, to lower to the ground
Although the individual lexical definitions of these verbs beginning with the consonant ‘b’ vary
widely, note that they all share common spatial and directional motion orientation between the
participants and the action. All the “b” verbs listed above have to do with motion towards a goal
location which results in contact or action on/at that goal-location. The vowels mark various
viewpoints of this action.
For example, in the list above, the verbs be⁹ and ba⁹ /ba³ /ba⁶ all involve a locative relationship
between an object and a goal location, but the vowel ‘e’ has stative qualities. To paint something
involves permanently locating and coating the goal location with the paint. The vowel ‘a’ has a
more generic motion viewpoint, to locate at a place. Both “ba⁹’ and ‘ba³’ involve a moving
object moving towards a goal and locating there. The verb “bi³” is an action that stresses
accomplishment, the total completion of the motion. To have arrived focuses on the completion
of the action of moving towards a goal reaching it and being there. The verb “baui³” to reach a
location is used in travel logs to indicate an intermediate or endpoint goal achieved. The focus is
more on the process of struggle or motion ending in achievement of an intermediate goal to
come/get as far as that location, implying a goal beyond that one, or in some contexts a barely
achieved goal.
The verb ‘ba⁶’ marked with a resultative aspect tone 6 means ‘to have come to’. This is
illustrated more clearly in the compound verb ‘da⁸ba⁶’ to bring s. to a location. The addition of
the more effective action completive viewpoint vowel “i”, forming the verb bai⁶ in a context
where a person is travelling in a canoe, gives the meaning ‘to beach or dock a canoe’ meaning to7
 Note to myself --See the Rice University (Houston Tx) ‘Eleventh Biennial Symposium:
Intertheoretical Approaches to Complex Verb Constructions’ for many interesting papers on this
topic to apply to Iau at some later date and investigate this topic more thoroughly.)                                                                                                 11
put it to shore and tie it up there or to run it aground on the beach. “Bai³ ba⁹” means the sun
comes up. But “Bai³ bae⁵” means the sunshine locates or comes onto something, that is, it shines
in on something.
The list above illustrates how the meaning of the consonants and the vowel(s) interact with the
context and the tone morphemes to indicate which specific meaning should be assigned to the
verb. For example, the verb ba³, ‘to move towards a goal and locate there’ in the context of
hunting or fighting with weapons, means to shoot at and hit something, to kill it. In other
contexts it can mean just to hit as in throwing a rock and hitting the target. However in a more
intransitive context with only a moving object and a location, ‘ba³’ can mean to come (durative
process) as opposed to “ba⁹” come (totality of action, punctual).
The verb ‘bu⁵’ means to burn down. It is a highly effective transitive action, with the agent
totally affecting the undergoer. With the addition of the completive action morpheme “i” and a
telic aspect tone 5, the verb bui⁵ means to cut down /fell a tree. That, is the tree is caused to fall
to the ground/move towards its inevitable and final action endpoint. This is a motion in which
the totally affected undergoer moves to and contacts the goal location, the ground.
The verb ‘bo⁵’ refers to the act of sitting down -usually on the ground or the floor or often in a
squatting position. The person lowers his backside to the floor. (The verb for being seated is a
different verb “b” verb bau⁴de⁹ –a stative verb.) The verb “boe⁵” means to lower something into
a hole, or down to the ground, or to hold out something for someone to see, to demonstrate.
The following charts show the general meanings of Iau consonant and vowel verb roots that
combine to form Iau verb stems.","[11, 12]"
