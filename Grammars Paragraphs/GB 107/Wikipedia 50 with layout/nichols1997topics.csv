     1.3.3 The Clause
     1.3.3.1    Negation
               Two elements are required to mark negation in the Zuni clause, a negative particle
 and a negative verb stem suffix, (38).                       The negative particle occurs at the head of the clause in a position to which evidential and quantifier-like particles also tend to gravitate (see below).            The negative suffix occurs after transitive subject agreement but before tense inflection. (38)          ka’        hon           waccita        ‘itok'ya-na:w-amme-'kya

  use of a negative particle somewhere to the left of the verb.3!                     This particle can occur in one of two positions, either close to the verb stem as in (8a) or farther to the left as in (8b) in a position where a number of other particles (evidential and adverbial) also occur (see
 Section 1.3.4.2).          I assume that the negation particle originates closer to the verb in the specifier position of a NegP projection, (9), and moves to the left edge of the clause as a result of a rule that affects particle placement in general.

            I assume therefore that the negation particle, here ka’             , marks the edge of the VP     in the position illustrated in (8a). Since the weak subject pronoun ho’ in (8a) occurs to
     the left of negative k”a', I assume that ho’ is outside the VP.                 I further assume that ho’ does not originate VP externally but rather moves to this position from inside the VP based on arguments for the origin of subject arguments inside the VP (cf. Sportiche 1988, Fukui 1986).","[53, 54]"

           It can be shown that Zuni infinitival clauses lack the functional projections of full
clauses.    If we assume that the presence of functional projections in a clause is indicatedby the presence of affixes on the verbs that correspond to the heads of these projections,we can note that the Zuni verb contains only the stem plus the infinitival suffix -nakya                          ,
(27a), and cannot appear with plural subject agreement (27b), tense inflection (27c), oreven a negation suffix (28a-b).39
39 The impossibility of negation with the infinitive is illustrated with both the non-stative and the stative
form of the negative suffix in (28a-b). The parenthesized example in (27c) and the parenthesis (28c) refer
to the possibility that the -na part of the infinitive suffix may be related to the stative morpheme -na (which
would precede any inflection).",[64]
"In (71a) -k- is present in the negative form of the eventive intransitive, while (71b) showsthat -k-    is absent in the stative form.

"           By chance, basically only two types of inflectional suffixes occur with eventive
transitive verbs, those with initial n               and those with initial non-sonorant consonant k orconsonant cluster            ?+C.     These are {Negation, Same-Subject} and {Future, Different-subject,     Past, Past Subordinate,         Negative Future, Hortatory,             Optative}    respectively,shown      in (70).!5!    In the derivation of the inflected verb stem, -k-                 occurs immediatelybefore the inflectional suffixes in (70).(70)a.     -na'm                Negation           -nan                 Same-Subject

described here. For semantic reasons to be detailed below, present tense inflection does not occur with this

               Although weak pronouns may occur as arguments of the verb, their syntax is    constrained by the requirement that weak pronouns undergo obligatory movement out of    the VP.         Basic word      order in Zuni is SOV,        as (6) illustrates with NP   arguments    that    undergo no special movement.30    (6)        waccita       wihac'ana       ‘utte-kya              dog         baby                bite-past              ‘The dog bit a baby.’          [* 'The baby bit a dog.']              (7a) illustrates the normal position of a weak pronominal object with respect to a lexical NP subject, while (7b) illustrates the unacceptability of a sentence containing aweak pronoun to the right of the NP subject and presumably inside the VP.

"52 Object shift is also discussed in relation to verb movement in Early Modern English by Roberts (1995).
53 The various positions of the subjects in (53) are due to the fact that the overt subject either remains in
situ or moves out of the VP. According to Henry, VP adverbs are preferred after the subject in these
imperatives, though they can also occur between verb and subject.
54 Similarly in Standard English, where the subject appears to the right of don’t (the subject obligatorily
appears to the left of the verb in non-negative imperatives).(i)a.       Don't you do that.

" 2.2.3 Verb Movement and Object Shift in Belfast English
            Belfast English affords a more detailed example of the role of V licensing in thedistribution of weak pronouns.
            Various studies of verb movement and object shift agree that Standard English
lacks main verb movement.              For example, Pollock (1989) argued that the placement ofadverbs (50) and negation (51) in English indicate that the verb remains inside the VP.                      Inthe case of negation, the empty T° head must be filled by do -support.(50)        [1p Felix   [vp quietly   [vp closed (*quietly) the window ]]](Si)a.      [1pFelix did [Negp not     [ypclose the window]]]       b.   *   Joe closed the window not            Since object shift is contingent on verb movement59 (Holmberg 1986), Standard
English also lacks object shift, even object shift of pronouns.5!",[80]
"
          Now note that arguments in Zuni do not move out of the VP to case positions, e.g. for the purposes of case assignment/checking.                   Evidence for this was discussed in Chapter 2, namely the position of the negation particle k¥a'                   with respect to arguments.        Weak
 pronouns move out the VP in order to be properly licensed, (52a), but other types of arguments do not move out of VP.            Assuming that the negation particle marks the edge of the VP!93, the position of ka’ in (52b) to the left of the NP subject and object arguments
 indicates that these arguments remain in situ.

             There is no corresponding indefinite suffix with the distribution of a case marker.
 There is instead a particle hof                    that indicates indefinite or non-specific reference.                  hot

 initial position, (32), a position frequented by evidential, negation and other particles (seebelow).          While hot itself can move, unlike -ya' , hot does not have the ability to licenseA-bar movement of arguments.                        As (33) illustrates, an NP cannot move along with hot tothe front of the clause.2°

 1.3.2.4     The Structure of Noun Phrases
            Elements of the noun phrase occur in the order determiner/possessor - quantifier -N - adjective.      This is illustrated in (34a-c).(34)a.     lukkya   temta        ‘a:-c'ana           these     all         pl.-small(ones)           ""All these children'b.         hom                    temia            Cawe            lsg.acc.(poss.)        all             children           ‘All my children’b.         hot      ko:wi            teSokya_c’ana           indef.   little.bit       hollow           small           ‘in some little hollow'                                                                 [Bunzel 1933]
                                                          23
            In addition,      it seems       that no more        than one adjective can occur with a noun         - compare (35a) and (35b) - nor can adjectives be conjoined as nominal modifiers with the coordinating conjunction tap                 ‘and’, (36).      Since adjectives are stative predicates in Zuni and can take verbal morphology, cf. Silowa-‘kya                        red-past ‘it was red’, the only method
 of combining them involves the formative a separate clause headed by one of the stative predicates, to which the other stative predicated is subordinated with the subordinate suffix -n.        This is illustrated in (37).         This stative predicate clause then is used to referanaphorically to the noun in question by means of the anaphoric particle /e’ .

          In addition, quantifying particles also occur in this sentence initial position.                         As
(47) illustrates, quantificational adverbials can quantify into objects from this position.

1.3.4.3   Stative vs. Non-Stative Stems
          An   important morphological               note on Zuni verbs         is that Zuni         verb   stems are
classified according to whether they are stative or not. Stative and non-stative verb stemstake   different     allomorphs           of   the   inflectional     endings      for   tense,       negation    and
subordination.      (48) -(50) illustrate these morphological distinctions.                This distinction will
be used in Chapter 3 as a diagnostic for the morphosyntactic structure of certain stems.","[43, 44]"
"            The position of the negation particle in example (10) illustrates that in contrast, lexical NP arguments do not undergo movement out of VP.

object pronouns as in (8a) and (lla) above, indirect object pronouns,                         (14a), subject
possessor pronouns,               (15a), and object possessor pronouns,           (16a), also undergo         this
movement.          Note that in (15a) and (16a) movement of the weak possessive pronoun outof VP results in a discontinuous possessive constituent, where the pOssessive pronoun has
moved to the left but the possessed noun has remained in situ.3232 In (16a) the particle hi§ occurs to the left of the fronted possessive pronoun fo'na:wan    in the usual

 2.3.1   Licensing Requirements of Inflectional Feature Bundles
          I propose      that the licensing requirements            of pronouns     ultimately    stem from
pronouns being constituted of inflectional feature bundles.58                 Pronouns therefore require
the same special licensing required of inflectional features.              Inflectional features generally
cannot stand on their own but rather must be located in some functional head F° that islicensed (governed) by some head X°.               This entails adjunction of the head F° containingthe features to licensing (governing)              head X°.      For this reason     we find inflectional
58 Everett (1996) proposes a somewhat similar conception of the nature of inflectional features (his
proposal for the origin of the configurations that these features occur in differs from the proposal here that
licensing requirements constrain these configurations). For him, inflectional categories, or inherent
features, are stored separately in the lexicon and inserted into functional heads (Agr’ and D’), so that
inflectional features are associated with spell-out rules rather than taking the form of traditional morphemes
stored in the lexicon. These features are inserted into heads in the configurations shown in (i); for Everett
the distribution of the heads containing these features is determined by differences in the category of the
head inserted into (D° vs. Agr*) and by properties of the selecting head (basically + subcategorizing).(i)      Pronouns:          (D™    [D* phi-features]}

 1.2 Data in this Thesis
         The Zuni data that appears in this thesis comes from two sources.         The bulk of the
Zuni in this thesis comes from my own field notes made during fieldwork conducted atZuni Pueblo during the summers of 1992 - 1996.             In addition, where relevant, data is
made use of from texts collected by Ruth Bunzel and published as Bunzel (1933).                The
Bunzel    texts, while quite a rich linguistic source in some ways,            are phonologically
unreliable.   The reader should therefore be aware that all of the data in this thesis fromBunzel    (1933)     has   been   retranscribed   and   is identified   each    time   it appears.
         I feel a great deal of responsibility in introducing the Zuni data contained hereinto theoretical discussion, particularly because there are so few other primary sourcematerials on Zuni.     As is always the case, despite having checked and rechecked the dataand judgments many times, one wishes one could have checked everything with nativespeakers still one more time.        I hope this dissertation may serve to generate furtherinterest in Zuni and add many more hands to the task of investigating the grammar of alanguage that has much to offer current generative theory and the study of cross-linguisticphenomena, much more beyond the topics illustrated by the chapters of this dissertation.
  1.3. Morphosyntactic Sketch of Zuni
            Because Zuni is largely unknown in the generative linguistic tradition, I will give
 in this section a brief descriptive outline of the more basic features of Zuni morphosyntax before going on to particular aspects of the syntax of Zuni in successive chapters.                            The
 reader should note, however, that this sketch is not intended to provide a complete grammatical description of Zuni but merely intended as an introduction to basic structural features of the language, particularly elements that will appear in examples throughout the dissertation       as well structural properties that will be relevant to the theoretical discussion in Chapters 2-4.4
 1.3.1 Basics of Morphology and Syntax
 1.3.1.1    Word Order
           In Zuni the verb occurs finally and strictly so; only an adverbial particle used toconvey perfect aspect (see example (40a) below) and parenthetical type adjuncts appearto be able to follow the verb.           Arguments occur in the order Subject - Indirect Object -
Direct Object, as illustrated in (1).5(l)a.      'a:w-okyaccik'         ‘a:-Siwi ‘a:w-an         ha'i__te-we'          wo-k'oSo-nap -kya
           pl.-woman              pl.-Zuni    pl.-P       three    pot-pl.       pl.obj.-wash-pl.subj.-past
           ‘The women washed three pots for the Zunis.'","[19, 20]"
"           On the other hand, it may be the case that morphological nominative case in somelanguages     does not represent the absence of case (as suggested                     earlier) but in fact
instantiates some positive feature [+nominative].                   If so, [+nominative] may in fact be a
licensing case in some languages in contexts like that in (124), and therefore acts like thelicensing functional projection          F° in strong pronouns            in parallel fashion to the way[+accusative] licenses pronouns in English.",[130]
"           I have been assuming in this section that the accusative case borne by Zuniarguments        in the unaccusative and the passive is structurally assigned.                           This is not
necessarily       clear     from      the      evidence      discussed   so   far,   nor   is the   nature   of theseconstructions in general clear - e.g. there is the question of the grammatical function of114 | will return to this point again in Section 3.4.

 with unaccusatives and passives in Icelandic and analyses proposed for them in order to clarify the nature of the Zuni unaccusatives and passives.","[140, 141]"

"          If default case assignment were a real option, we should expect to find languageswith    strong accusative        or strong         nominative    pronouns    possible    for every      possible
response.     The fact that we do not seems to indicate that true default case assignment is
not available in UG in these contexts.                The examples of true default case we do seem tohave    occur      in child   language    (cf. Schiitze         1997)    or perhaps     in second     language
acquisition, suggesting that true default case assignment is of a different nature (i.e.simply a choice between features of equal status) than the type of case assignment found

           All three of these statements              or assumptions               concerning     the nature of Zuni
pronouns can be challenged.                In doing so we reveal a rich morphosyntactic system whoseanalysis         will have       implications     beyond       Zuni     itself.    I focus     here on the first two
statements; the third is more innocuous.27           First of all, as indicated in the table and contrary to Newman's statement, object oraccusative forms do have long forms.                  These can be found when the accusative pronounis used as a bare response to a question, as in (2).28 I will return to this evidence shortly.",[49]
"
          In light of this sensitivity, the following facts are quite interesting.             Passivemorphology consists of stative -na.                When the passive bears negation or same-subject
inflection, however, the non-stative allomorph of inflection is selected, as (77) illustrates.(77)a.    ka’      tom   ‘itok'ya-na-k-na'm-a          neg.     2sg.acc.     feed-passive-K-neg.-pres.",[184]
"             Examples (18a-c) below illustrate the use of Zuni strong subject, object, and
 possessive pronouns as single word (bare) responses to questions.                          No other clausal
 material accompanies the pronoun in this usage.33 Weak pronouns are excluded from this context.",[58]
"          Only pronouns that are strong and therefore are otherwise licensed (i.e. have theadditional licensing head F*) should be able to show true default case in bare responsecontexts.      The licensing requirements of weak pronouns will require the selection ofaccusative!©l case in contexts where no other potential licenser is available.                          In bare
responses, any default case specification (or case specified somehow in a clausal structure
that is then deleted) will be overridden on bare weak pronouns in favor of accusative casebecause of the licensing properties of accusative.                   Therefore we should find never findlanguages with only bare nominative weak pronouns but only bare accusative weakpronouns for all possible responses in a language;!0? languages with strong accusativepronouns      f.a.p.r. or strong nominative pronouns                 f.a.p.r.;    and languages with strong
matching-case        pronouns      f.a.p.r.    in bare   response        forms.     ‘Case   matching’   is the
preservation on the bare pronoun of the case the pronoun would show as an argument in a
full clause.       Since licensing considerations override case in weak pronouns, case
matching can only show up in strong pronouns, as in Zuni, (121).

60 | will assume here that case features are different, as indicated by the fact that case sometimes stands on
its own as a particle, for example the ERG case particle e in Samoan, as in (i) below. I follow the
proposals made by Lamontagne & Travis        (1987) and Bittner & Hale (1996a,b) and assume that case
features are contained in their own head K"" specific to case (as opposed to person, number etc. features
which are all contained together in some Agr” head). While I will assume this analysis of case generally, it
may turn out to be appropriate for case only in certain languages.(i)         Samoan           sa   sasa    e    le teine   le maile

             If features contained in the pronominal head have a special licensing requirement,
 we   should       expect    to find     a contrast         in the syntactic    behavior      of items   that are morphologically identical but have a different feature content and therefore different
 licensing        requirements.        Such       is the case     with Zuni    2nd   versus    3rd   person   dual
 imperatives.        The dual marker ‘a:ci            is used with both 2nd and 3rd person imperative subjects.     There is a contrast in the syntactic behavior of ‘a:¢i , however, depending on its person features.       2nd person ‘a:¢ci undergoes obligatory movement of the kind described in Section 2.1 for Zuni Ist and 2nd person weak pronouns, (68a).                      In contrast, 3rd person ‘a:ci_ does not undergo this movement, (68b-b’).(68)a.

"         Zuni pronouns distinguish person, number, and case, and occur in two forms each,a short form and a long form, shown in (1).24 Newman (1965: 60) lists these pronominalforms? and states that the long forms (first row of each person) are only used utterance-finally while the short forms (‘utterance medial forms’) occur everywhere else.                   He goes
so far as to say (p.61) that there are no corresponding ‘utterance-final' forms for the object(accusative) pronouns since "" object pronouns do not occur in utterance final position.”",[48]

           In fact, Zuni     has multiple WH                  movement,       since all question      words   present
undergo movement,           (44a).    As (44b) indicates, the moved question words appear in thesame relative order as their argument structure positions, namely subject - indirect object- direct object.",[42]
"63 This assumption contrasts with that of Cardinaletti and Starke (1994), who assume case, agreement and
referential features are located together in a C° head. Further, for them NP not DP is the root of the
pronoun structure they propose.
64 More specifically, I assume K’ either contains case features itself, or is empty and is associated with case
features located elsewhere (Bittner & Hale 1996a). The distinction (and relevance for pronoun licensing)
will be discussed below.
65 [n the case of Zuni singular and plural nominative strong forms (cf. the examples in (1) earlier), F*
appears to be filled by a copy of the number feature of the base. The morpheme -no found in the strong
pronouns is also found in the suppletive plural imperative of the verb ‘a: ‘go’, (i) below. F° can apparently
also be filled by an dummy morpheme consisting of final gemination of weak pronoun +a                   and is found in
the accusative and possessive singular strong forms. This same gemination +a dummy ending can be
found (for different reasons) on items from other lexical classes, (ii).(i)         ‘a:              go

             Recall that it was argued above that pronominal features require licensing as other  inflectional features do, and that pronouns are licensed when they are in the minimal domain of some licensing head X°.             I suggest more specifically that pronominal-licensing head X° is a functional head, and that there are two ways in which pronominal features can be licensed by a functional head.             Either the pronoun must contain some licensing functional head (i.e. F°) as part of its structure, as in the case of the strong pronouns, or if F* is absent, as in the case of weak pronouns,                 the pronoun must move         to the minimal domain       of some    other functional head (i.e. in IP).        In other words,      the need for some alternative form of licensing for their pronominal features drives the movement of weak pronouns.","[90, 91]"
