"            Murui lacks an independent grammatical word ‘no’; negative answers are expressedby jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ followed by negated predicates instead (§10.3.1). 272 Murui has a number ofquestion words which can function as indefinites, such as ‘nobody/somebody’ and‘nothing/something’. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’s polarity(see also jaka in (10.3) that can mean ‘always’ or ‘never’). The language doesn’t seem tohave inherently negative words. A few positive words however, such as mare ‘good,272

beautiful’, do not have dedicated negative counterparts; the only way to say ‘bad’ is to negatemare, as in maraiñede ‘bad (lit. not good)’. 273
10.2 Clausal negation
Expression of negation in Murui involves morphological processes of verbal affixation of thestandard negative -ñe and the negative attributive -ni used both in main and subordinateclauses. 274 There is no special negative construction type ‒ a negative clause is structurallythe same as the positive one, with the addition of -ñe or -ni. These markers have the same slotin the structure of a Murui predicate (see §7.1) and thus never co-occur. While the standardnegative -ñe marks negation of all kinds, the negative attributive denotes either ‘lack ofability’ (with verbs), ‘lack of property’ (with adjectives), and ‘lack of possession’ (withnouns). The negative attributive -ni is the ‘dedicated’ counterpart of the positive attributivemarker -re (meaning ‘ability’ with verbs, ‘property’ with adjectives, and ‘possession’ withnouns) (see Table 10.3 §10.1). In the speech of older speakers of Murui, the positiveattributive marker -re cannot be negated (the negative attributive is used instead). Someyounger speakers do however negate -re with the standard negative marker -ñe.","[457, 458]"
"
10.3.1 Negative answersMurui lacks independent positive and negative words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’. 281 The language hasthree ways to respond to positive and negative questions. They involve:
          – the interjection jɨɨ whose meaning ‘yes, no’ depending on the polarity of the verb          used in a question, or          – a full clause.",[478]
"
Often both mechanisms are combined. The interjection jɨɨ can be interpreted as some type ofagreement rather than a full-fledged positive or negative response item. Examples (10.90-91)illustrate the reading of jɨɨ which ‘agrees’ with the verb’s polarity:
(10.90) a. iraiS bono-dɨ-o?PRED
           fire burn.SMLF-LK-2sg
           ‘Did you set the fire?’
             b. jɨɨ!
                yes
                ‘Yes.’
280
      Murui has no word for ‘bad’. Maraiñede ‘no good’ is the nearest approximation of the English ‘bad’, the
antonym of ‘good’.
281
      Murui has also an independent positive response form ɨjɨ ‘uh-huh/yes’ used by hearers and speakers mainly
as a type of an acknowledgment during narration of traditional stories.
                                                                                               454
(10.91) a. irai bono-ñe-dɨ-o?PRED
           fire burn.SMLF-LK-2sg
           ‘Didn’t you set the fire?’
         b. jɨɨ!
            no
            ‘No.’
Frequently, when as an answer to a negative question, as in (10.91b), the independent wordjɨɨ is stressed, the predicate has a slightly higher pitch, and it is accompanied by a firmheadshake. A negative answer can also be a full clause. (10.92-93) could be the answers toeither (10.90a) or (10.91a) above.
(10.92) bono-dɨ-kuePRED
        burn.SMLF-LK-1sg
        ‘I set the fire. ‘
(10.93) bono-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
        burn.SMLF-NEG-LK-1sg
        ‘I didn’t set the fire. ‘
The negative answer can also consist of the interjection jɨɨ and a full clause combined, as in(10.94-95):
(10.94) (jɨɨ!) bono-dɨ-kuePRED
        yes burn.SMLF-LK-1sg
        ‘Yes, I did set the fire. ‘
(10.95) (jɨɨ!) bono-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
        no burn.SMLF-NEG-LK-1sg
        ‘No, I didn’t set the fire. ‘
When one disagrees, they respond with jɨɨ obligatorily followed by a full clause with reversedpolarity. When a question is positive, as in (10.96), a full clause is marked for negation, as in(10.97); cf. with (10.98). In case of a negative question, as in (10.99), the full clause ispositive, as in (10.100); cf (10.101).
(10.96) kaka-dɨ-o?PRED
        hear-LK-2sg
        ‘Do you understand (lit. hear)?’

(10.97) jɨɨ! kaka-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
        no hear-NEG-LK-1sg
        ‘No, I don’t understand.’
(10.98) jɨɨ! (kaka-dɨ-kue)PRED

        ‘Yes, I understand. ‘

        ‘Didn’t Kata come?’
(10.100) jɨɨ! bi-t-ePRED

         ‘Yes, she came.’
(10.101) jɨɨ! (bi-ñe-d-e)PRED
         no come-NEG-LK-3
         ‘No, she didn’t came.’
Example (10.102) is a negative answer to the question uru-e-re-dɨ-o? (child-CLF:G-ATT-LK-2sg) ‘Do you have children?’. Additionally, the noun uru-e ‘child’ which is the head of theintransitive predicate, takes negative attributive marking to express lack of possession.
(10.102) jɨɨ! uru-e-ni-dɨ-kuePRED
         no child-CLF:G-PRIV-LK-1sg
         ‘No! I don’t have children.’
The young speakers of Murui negate the ‘positive possession’ expressed with the positiveattributive -re with the standard negative -ñe, as in (10.103a-b). The elders consider this to beincorrect. Once a Murui elder Lucio asked Walter whether he had a boat motor. Walteranswered with (10.103a). Lucio corrected him with (10.103b):
(10.103) a.   W: jɨɨ! moto-re-ñe-dɨ-kue PRED
                 no motor-ATT-NEG-LK-1sg
                 ‘No, I don’t have the motor.’
         b.   L: moto-ni-dɨ-o…PRED    bueñe?
                 motor-PRIV-LK-2sg WHY
                 ‘You don’t have the motor... Why?’
                                                                                                456
Murui has also the sentence final jɨɨ used in narratives, usually followed by a significantpause (see §13.3.1).","[478, 479, 480, 481]"
"      Negation of Murui predicates is expressed in two different ways. There are twonegative markers: the standard negative marker -ñe, and the negative attributive -ni for ‘lackof attribution’. Example (1.13) shows the verb fa(te) ‘hit’ negated with the negative marker-ñe; in (1.14) the adjective kaɨma- ‘tasty’ is negated with the negative attributive -ni.
(1.13) [bai-mɨeA         yɨkɨ-aɨO       kue-naO             fa-ta-ñe-d-ePRED
       that.FSH-CLF:PR.M fish-PL        1sg-N.S/A.TOP       kill-CAUS-NEG-LK-3
       ‘He did not make me kill the fish.’
(1.14) [bi-e              yɨkɨ-aɨ]S eo         kaɨma-ni-d-ePRED
       this.CTS-CLF:G fish-PL very tasty-NEG.ATT-LK-3
       ‘This fish is not very tasty (lit. not having the property of being very tasty).’
The (negative) attributive markers have somewhat different meanings in differentenvironments. With verbs they denote ‘(lack of) ability’, with adjectives ‘(lack of) property’,and with nouns ‘(lack of) possession’. Murui lacks independent grammatical words for ‘yes’and ‘no’. The interjection jɨɨ ‘agrees’ with the verb’s polarity, and, depending on the context,can be translated as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Negation is discussed in Chapter 10.",[34]

Examples (10.2a-b) illustrate the positive and the negative constructions with the attributivemarkers -re (‘positive attributive’) and -ni (‘negative attributive’) that follow the verbal rootɨɨ- ‘swim’. Depending on the marker, they mean roughly ‘to have the ability to swim’ and‘not to have the ability to swim’:

          ‘I can’t swim (e.g. because I am sick)’
Depending on the word class they occur with, the attributive markers have differentsemantics. They involve ‘ability’, as in (10.2a-b) above, but can also refer to ‘property’ and‘possession’. The semantics of Murui attributive markers is outlined in Table 10.2.","[454, 455]"

10.4 Summary
Murui negation involves the morphological process of affixation, where negative markers areadded to a corresponding positive in both main and subordinate clauses. Negation of Muruipredicates is expressed in two different ways: by the standard negative marker -ñe and thenegative attributive -ni for ‘lack of attribution (ability, property, possession)’. Murui lacksindependent grammatical words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’ (for which jɨɨ is used). Question words canfunction as indefinites. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’spolarity.

10.1 Negation ‒ general characteristics
Negation in Murui involves the morphological process of affixation, where a negative markeris added to a corresponding positive in main and subordinate clauses. Negation of predicatesis expressed in two different ways: with the standard negative marker -ñe (slot 10 on the verbstructure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and with the negative attributive -ni ‘lack of attribution(ability, property, possession)’ (slot 11, cf. the mutually exclusive positive attributive -re forhaving ‘attribution (ability, property, possession’). The Murui negative markers with theircorresponding positive equivalents are illustrated in Table 10.1.",[454]

Negation is shown by a single negation marker within a clause (see the privative §10.2.5).",[456]

A constituent of a negated clause may bear additional stress. Additionally, the topical S/Aand non-S/A subject markers are present on a constituent that is in constrative focus. Toexpress meanings such as ‘it wasn’t the man we met, it was the spirit’ speakers say ‘we didn’tmeet THE MAN; we met THE SPIRIT’, as in (10.4) below (cf. jɨko=dɨ (dog=S/A.TOP) ‘dog’in example (6.10) in §6.2.1.1):

(10.5) is an example of the nominalized clausal constituent ‘one who doesn’t talk’. Cases ofdouble negation within a sentence, such as in (10.5), are not too frequent.

In Murui, questions differ from declarative and imperative clauses in both their intonation aswell as structure (see §11.2). The structure of some type of questions is unusual in thatpredicate markers can be omitted for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural. Negative questionswith omitted predicate markers have different readings than their positive counterparts (see§10.2.2). Murui has a single negative imperative (prohibitive) form, the standard negativemarker -ñe followed by the marker -no (see §10.2.3). Many of grammatical categoriesavailable in positive clauses are available in the negative as well but there is some minordegree of paradigmatic asymmetry between positive and negative imperatives. For instance,the grammatical category of rapid action (used for immediate imperative meanings) cannot beexpressed in negative imperative. The language has two ‘privative’ markers -nino on nouns,and -nino and -ñeno on verbs and adjectives (on verbs, -ñeno has prohibitive meanings, see§10.2.3).","[456, 457]"
"
10.3.2 Negative wordsThe interrogative content words buu ‘who’ and bu-e (Q1-CLF:G) ‘what’ that are used incontent questions (see §3.3.4 and §11.2) can have indefinite readings. If the sentence containsa negative predicate, their meaning is ‘nobody’ and ‘nothing’; if the predicate’s polarity is‘positive’, they mean ‘someone’ and ‘something’. Examples are given in (10.104-105). Thereference of buu ‘who’ is reserved only for human referents, bue ‘what’ refers to non-humanreferents.

In (10.106) the head of the intransitive predicate is the interrogative bue ‘what’ having anegative indefinite meaning. This is similar in (10.107), which comes from an excerpt of afierce discussion between a father and a son.

In the examples above, the reading of the independent word jaka depends on the polarity ofthe predicate and can be translated into English as either as ‘never’ or ‘always’. Jaka is anadverbial that means ‘at all events, over and over’.","[481, 482]"
"        The language has a number of ways to express equality and similative meanings. Themost conventional way to express quality includes the postposition izoi ‘similar’. Similativemeanings are expressed with the similative -ze, as well as a restricted set of verbs.

10 NegationThis chapter deals with negation in Murui. General characteristics of negation are discussedin §10.1. The following section §10.2 deals with clausal negation, including negation ofdeclaratives (§10.2.1), interrogatives (§10.2.2), and verbless clauses (§10.2.4). Clausalnegation with the privative is discussed is §10.2.4 (see also §6.2.2.5). Section §10.3 focuseson non-clausal negation (negative answers in §10.3.1, and negative words in §10.3.2).

Generally, the positive attributive -re, as in moko-re-d-e (green-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) green’,cannot be negated with either of the negative markers. The positive attributive -re occurs inthe same structural slot as the negative attributive -ni (see §3.1.3). Nowadays, youngerspeakers of Murui occasionally negate the positive attributive -re with the standard negativemarker -ñe, yielding constructions such as moko-re-ñe-d-e (green-ATT-NEG-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not

green’. Older speakers accept only negative constructions with the negative attributive -ni, asin moko-ni-d-e (green-NEG.ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not green’. The standard negative and theattributive markers are used in slightly different environments. While the attributive markersoccur on verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the standard negative -ñe occurs on verbs and nounsonly (with adjectives, the negative attributive is used instead of the standard negative marker-ñe). The occurrence of Murui attributive and standard negative markers with verbs,adjectives, and nouns is given in Table 10.3 below.","[455, 456]"
"While in positive declarative sentences non-subject arguments are optionally marked withtopical non-S/A subject -na (see §6.2.1), in their negative counterparts -na is almostfrequently present, as in (10.17-18) below.

Identity in Murui is expressed by means of an intransitive predicate when S arguments arepronominal subjects (see Table 7.1 in §7.1). In such cases nouns function as heads ofintransitive clauses, as in (10.19). Intransitive predicates can be negated with the standardnegative -ñe.

For 3rd person singular, dual, and plural, identity is typically expressed by juxtaposition oftwo NP’s, as in (10.21) (see also §12.1.1 on verbless clauses). As Murui verbless clauses
                                                                                            437
cannot express verbal categories (such as tense or aspect) or negation, the only way toexpress them is by means of negated intransitive predicates with nominal heads. Compare the‘positive’ verbless clauses with the negated ones in (10.22-23):
(10.21) nai-ñaiñoVCS     [Fareka Buiñai-ño]VCC
        ANA.SP-CLF:PR.F Fareka       mermaid-CLF:PR.F
        ‘She is Fareka Buinaiño (lit. she - she Fareka Buiñaiño).’
(10.22) [kue ɨni]S    mano-ri-raɨ-ma-it-ePRED
        1sg husband heal-DUR-AGT-CLF:DR.M-FUT.LK-3
        ‘My husband will be a shaman (lit. my husband - to-be-shaman).’
(10.23) [kue izo]S nɨmaira-ma-ñe-d-ePRED
        1sg uncle wise.man-CLF:DR.M-NEG-LK-3
        ‘My uncle is not a wise man (lit. my husband - non-wise man).’10.2.1.2 Negative attributionMurui negative attributive marker occurs on predicates whose heads are verbs, adjectives,and nouns. Verbal roots that are marked with the negative attributive -ni have the meaning of‘not having ability (to perform an action)’. In the following example (10.24), a small girl wasasked to go to the river to play. As she did not want to go, she answered:
(10.24) iye-moLOC jaai-aka-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED [kue ei-yɨ                   i-ko
        river-LOC go-DES-NEG-LK-1sg            1sg foot-CLF:BUSHY ANA.NSP-CLF:COVER
        dɨga]     i-tɨ-kue=zaPRED          ɨɨ-ni-dɨ-kuePRED
        WITH      exist-LK-1sg=UNCERT swim-NEG.ATT-LK-1sg
        ‘I don’t not want to go to the river. I have my shoes on so I can’t swim.’
In another example, a woman asked her granddaughter to sweep the house of Adriana.","[461, 462]"
"
10.2.1 Negation of declarativesNegation of the declarative clauses is expressed by the standard negative marker -ñe and thenegative attributive -ni added to a corresponding positive. Their forms, functions as well asstructural differences between the two markers are discussed in turn.",[459]

In the text, vernacular data is given in italics. Examples are numbered according to the
Chapter they are in (e.g. example ‘(1.5)’ refers to Chapter 1, example 5). Examples have
three lines. The first line is orthographic and breaks up each word into morphemes. The
second line shows morpheme-level glosses. SMALL CAPS are used for grammatical glosses.
Proper names are reproduced throughout the glossing. The final line provides a free
translation into English. The free translations are as idiomatic as possible; parentheses
complement contextual meaning of the free translations. If an example is to be found in the
text in the Appendix, it is marked with ‘TextNumber.SentenceNumber’, as in (T3.3).
      In the text, verbs are given in a citation form, where the predicate marker (-dɨ/-tɨ) is
followed by the 3rd person pronominal subject marker -e. For instance, the verb ‘write’ is
presented as kue(te) ‘write’, where kue- is a verbal root. Punctuation depend on the pauses in
speaker’s speech after the sentence is considered to have been completed. Clauses and
sentences are not capitalized. When one word has several different meanings, the most
appropriate one is given in the gloss. ‘Headless’ nominal modifiers that are used as heads of
intransitive predicates are often shown in brackets to indicate non-verbal forms used
intransitively, e.g. [mare-ko]-d-e (good.ATT-CLF.REP.DOG-LK-3) ‘it’s a good (dog)’.
      The quotation marks placed around the term Witoto are done at the request of the
Murui, Mɨnɨka, Mɨka, and Nɨpode people. ‘Witoto’ subsumed these four separate groups. The
term Witotoan refers to the language family (that consists of ‘Witoto’, Ocaina, and Nonuya).
      Throughout the chapters, there are a few numbering gaps, as some examples were
eliminated in the final stage of the revision process.

1 The Murui language and its speakersMurui, also known in literature as Búe, Uitoto, Witoto, and Huitoto, belongs to the Witotoanlanguage family, one of the smaller linguistic families in Amazonia, that consists of two otherlanguages spoken in the area, Ocaina (still spoken by about 90 people) and Nonuya (amoribund language). Murui is spoken by about 2,000 people that traditionally inhabited theregion of the Amazon Basin between the middle sections of the Caquetá and Putumayo riversin Colombia and their tributaries, the Igara-Paraná and Cara-Paraná rivers. Today, smallerMurui tribes live also ‘outside’ the Caquetá-Putumayo region. There is a mixed communityof Murui-Mɨnɨka people located in the Resguardo Indígena Tikuna-Uitoto (known as‘Kilómetro 11’) close to Leticia (Colombia). Some also inhabit areas along the Ampi-Yacúand Napo rivers in Peru (see e.g. Petersen de Piñeros and Patiño Rosselli (2000: 219)).","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"           Murui negative imperatives express fewer categories than their positivecounterparts. 277 While positive imperatives can take all aspectual markers and makedistinction between ‘delayed’ vs. ‘immediate’ imperative, prohibitives make no suchdistinction (Wojtylak, 2016b). For instance, the only way to negate the immediate imperativemaɨnokai! ‘tie quickly!’ in (10.70) is maɨñeno! ‘don’t tie!’ in (10.71):
(10.70) fuirɨ      jaai-do=za            [kue nokae]O      maɨ-no-kai! PRED

        quick-N.S/A.TOP come          this.CTS-CLF:CRAFT tie-NEG-PRIV.PROH
        ‘Come quickly! Don’t tie this boat!’
Negative imperatives involving adjectives have to take special markers with meanings of‘become’ to occur in prohibitive constructions. 278 This is illustrated in (10.72) where awoman ‘gave an order’ to a pot of soup she just cooked not to get cold:
277
      This is congruent with Aikhenvald (2010). For instance, those Murui verbs that take the ‘terminative’ marker
-bi, e.g. ikɨ-d-e ‘tell off (somebody)’ > ikɨ-bi-t-e ‘(s/he) was told off’, cannot be followed by prohibitive marker
(*ikɨ-bi-ñe-no!). The only way to express it is by ikɨ-ñe-no! ‘don’t tell (somebody) off!’. More work has to be
done to establish how the Murui imperative and negative imperative co-occur with such verbal markers.
278
      There is no difference between positive and negative imperatives with adjectives – all types of adjectives
have to take the ‘become’ markers to occur in imperative constructions.
                                                                                            449
(10.72) rozi-nai-ñe-no!PRED
        cold-BECOME1-NEG-PRIV.PROH
        ‘Do not get cold!’
Structurally, this is somewhat similar to negated apprehensive (see §7.2.3.1) (negatedapprehensive is rarely used). (10.73) is a warning by an elder to a boy who wanted to go tothe jungle on his own.
(10.73) jakɨ-nai-ñe-iza!PRED
        scared-BECOME1-NEG-APPRH
        ‘Be careful with not getting scared!’ (meaning: get scared)
Constructions with the standard negative -ñe followed by -no which do not involve suchsuffixes are not considered to have prohibitive meanings. In (10.74) the adjective uzi- ‘hot’ ismarked with the negative attributive followed by the privative -ni. The meaning of uzininodoes not have command-like connotations.

In some specific context-bound situations, negative questions seem to be understood as ‘yesor no’ questions. In the following example (10.52), Rata asked Maria to go and do somethingtogether. Maria seemed to be quite sad that day, and Rata wanted to cheer her up:

B. NEGATIVE DECLARATIVE CLAUSES USED FOR 3rd PERSON WITHOUT PREDICATE MARKERS –structures of predicates referring to 3rd person present a peculiarity – the omission ofpredicate markers. They are used exclusively for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural, and aremarked with both the standard negative and the negative attributive markers. Such structuresdo not differ in terms of their intonation from other types of questions. They alwayspresuppose that the answer will be positive. In (10.53), a woman asked her daughter to sweepinside the house while she went to work. She came back a couple of hours later and upon theentering the house, upon entering the house she asked her son:

        ‘Did (she) sweep the house? (She probably has)’
(10.54) is a response of elder Lucio to his wife Clementina. Clementina asked Lucio wherehe left the basket with fruit he brought in the morning.

        maloca-CLF:COVER-LOC exist-NEG
        ‘Isn’t it in the maloca? (it’s probably there)’
Another example is presented in (10.55). A man came to the village looking for a localshaman. He kept looking but he did not find him. He asked another man:

The following examples illustrate verbs without predicative marking followed by thenegative attributive -ni. In (10.56), Sandriela asked Flor if Rata could cook at Flor’s house.","[468, 469]"

      The major speech acts are conventionally referred to as ‘mood’ where statements are characterized by
declarative/indicative mood, commands correspond to imperative mood, and questions are referred to as
interrogative mood (Aikhenvald 2010).

12.1.1 DeclarativeThe most frequent clause type is the declarative (affirmative). This is the ‘default’(functionally unmarked) clause type in the language. Similary to the interrogative, thedeclarative clause is not marked with any separate morpheme. The declarative vs.interrogative distinction is made using a special intonation contour (see §2.4). The constituentorder of the declarative is usually of the AOV/SV type but it can also be determined bypragmatic factors (with O being postposed to the clause-final verb) (this is in contrast withdependent declarative clauses, where the constituent order appears to be rigid, being verb-final). In natural discourse, clauses with two overtly stated arguments, A and O, are rare (see§6.1-2). Declarative clauses in Murui are A. INTRANSITIVE CLAUSES, B. EXTENDEDINTRANSITIVE CLAUSES, C. TRANSITIVE CLAUSES, D. EXTENDED TRANSITIVE CLAUSES, and E.","[507, 508]"

Examples (10.46-48) illustrate the scope of Murui negation. While in (10.46) the standardnegative -ñe has scope over the main clause, in (10.47) its scope extends over thecomplement clause. Example (10.48) is a case of ‘double negation’ where negation extendsover both the main and the complement clause. Double negative does not have positivereadings in Murui.

      – those which have structures of declarative clauses (with interrogative intonation), and      – those which do not; they bear no predicative marking.","[465, 466, 467]"
"An example of an adjective is given in (10.59-60) below. In (10.59), the adjective zefui-‘bored’ is marked with the negative attributive -ni. (10.60) is expressed by a young Muruispeaker: the positive attributive -re is followed by the standard negative -ñe, cf. examples(10.27), (10.35), and (10.36).

        this.CTS-CLF:DAY cold-NEG.ATT
        ‘Isn’t it cold today? (it probably is)’
The occurrence of the standard negative marker on negated interrogative constructionswithout predicate markers is unusual, but nevertheless, it does occasionally occur. Example(10.62) comes from the negated declarative clause ‘it’s not a house’; the head of the negatedpredicate is the noun jofo ‘house’, as in jo-fo-ñe-d-e (house-CLF:CAV-NEG-LK-3).
(10.62) jo-fo-ñe?PRED
        house-CLF:CAV-NEG
        ‘Isn’t it the house (lit. non-house)? (it probably is)’
In the following example (10.63) Maria asked Flor if Adam had children. Compare thesemantics of (10.63) with that of (10.64) which takes the predicate marking:
(10.63) AdamS aɨ-ni-d-e PRED       ie=ta…       uru-e-ni?PRED
        Adam wife-NEG.ATT-LK-3 CONN=REP child-CLF:G-NEG.ATT
        ‘Adam doesn’t have a wife… but does he have children? (probably he has)’
(10.64) uru-e-ni-d-e?PRED
        child-CLF:G-NEG.ATT-LK-3
        ‘Doesn’t he have children? (probably not)’10.2.3 Negative imperativesAlthough Murui has a number of imperative constructions (see also §11.1 on canonical andnon-canonical imperatives), the language has a single prohibitive form for the negativeimperatives. Murui prohibitive constructions refer always to the 2nd person, and are markedon verbs by the standard negative -ñe obligatorily followed by the privative -no. Withadjectives and nouns, such structures have no prohibitive reading (see §11.2.3). The negative
                                                                                              447
attributive that occurs in such construction has no prohibitive meanings. Examples of Muruinegative imperatives (prohibitives) are given in (10.65-66):
(10.65) ñaaɨ-ñe-noPRED           [jadi-e   izoi!]
        speak-NEG-PRIV.PROH this.CTH-CLF:G similar
        ‘You do not speak like that!’

        1sg house-CLF:CAV-LOC 2du.masc eat-NEG-PRIV.PROH
        ‘You (two men) do not eat in my house!’
In the following example (10.67) a mother called for her daughter, and advised her not toclose the door.
(10.67) bene             bii!PRED     nazeO ɨbai-ñe-no!PRED
           HERE.LOC:NSP  come         door close-NEG-PRIV.PROH
           ‘Come here! Do not close the door!’
Negative imperatives, just as the positive ones, refer only to 1st and 2nd person (see also§11.1). An example of a negative imperative used for 2nd person plural is illustrated in(10.68):
(10.68) [omoɨ mirɨ-ño-ni-no]                  gui-ni-dɨ-omoɨ!PRED        gui-ñe-no!PRED
        2pl    sister-CLF:DR.F-NEG.ATT-PRIV eat-NEG.ATT-LK-2pl           eat-NEG-PRIV.PROH
        ‘You cannot eat without your sister! Don’t eat!’
The prohibitive meaning is restricted to verbs only (such constructions have a special rising-falling intonation, see §11.1). With adjectives and nouns the meaning is strictly privative‘without’. Verbs used in such construction can also have privative readings if they are notaccompanied by the rising-falling intonation, as in (10.69):
(10.69) maɨjɨ-ñe-no      bi-tɨ-kuePRED
        work-NEG-PRIV come-LK-1sg
        ‘I came without having worked.’
The Murui prohibitive and privative can in fact be considered a special clause type ofprivative nominalized clauses. Historically, the Murui prohibitive seems to have originated in
                                                                                                                   448
the reanalysis of such clauses. The prohibitive might have been a command strategy at first.","[470, 471, 472, 473]"
"These are: negative replies (§10.3.1) and negative indefinite words (§10.3.2). Murui does notseem to have inherently negative lexemes that would have a negative meaning but would notbear a negative affix or have no positive counterpart. Interestingly, the adjective mare ‘good’is the only one that is negated but synchronically could be interpreted as a type of lexicalized
                                                                                                                453
expression: maraiñede (good.ATT.NEG-LK-3) ‘bad (lit. not good)’. 280 Maraiñede is the onlyoccurrence of the standard negative-ñe which triggers an unusual phonological (and possiblyan archaic) change mare > marai. Note that neither the standard negative -ñe nor the negativeattributive-ni can occur with mare: *mare-ñe-d-e and *mare-ni-d-e are ungrammatical.","[477, 478]"
"       Murui distinguishes between content, polar, tag, alternative, and exclamativequestions. All of these have some phonological and morphological properties characteristic to
                                                                                                10
them (i.e. different intonation patterns, presence of a tag, and a special kind of morphologicalelisions). All interrogative content words are based on two free forms: buu ‘who’ and nɨɨ‘which, where’. To express meanings like ‘what’, ‘where’, and ‘when’, buu and nɨɨ takeclassifiers, e.g. nɨ-rui? (Q2-CLF:DAY) ‘when (lit. which day)?’. Question words can alsofunction as indefinite words; their positive or negative reading depends on the polarity of theverb, as in (1.15a-b).

          Q1-N.S/A.TOP   see-LK-1sg

          ‘I saw nobody.’ or ‘I didn’t see anybody.’
Murui canonical and non-canonical imperatives are usually formally marked, and havespecial paralinguistic features such as intonation, frequently accompanied by distinct facialexpressions. Murui has canonical imperatives (that is those which are directed to 2nd person)and non-canonical imperative forms for 1st person (with hortative meanings). There is nojussive for 3rd person. Imperatives can be marked with a special aspectual marker -kai whichfollows the imperative suffix and indicates urgency and expectation of an immediateresponse. Compare the examples below:
(1.16) gui-ño! (eat-IMP) ‘eat!’
(1.17) gui-ño-kai! (eat-IMP-RAPID) ‘eat quickly!’Additionally, there are a number of imperative strategies, which involve among others futureevent nominalizations, e.g. maka-ye (walk-FUT.E.NMLZ) ‘go walking (lit. future action ofwalking)’. Murui questions and commands are discussed in Chapter 11.","[34, 35]"
"        Murui does not have a separate verb meaning ‘have’. As shown in (10.19) identity inMurui can be expressed by intransitive predicates with nominal heads. This is furtherillustrated in (10.31a-b).
(10.31) a. uru-e-dɨ-kuePRED
           child-CLF:G-LK-1sg
           ‘I am a child.’

            child-CLF:G-NEG-LK-1sg
            ‘I am not a child (lit. I am non-child).’
The expression of possession in the language is similar to that of identity in that nounsfunction as intransitive predicates. Such predicatively functioning nouns are marked with thepositive attributive -re to express ‘possession’ or the negative attributive -ni for ‘lack ofpossession’ (see also §5.1.3). Compare the examples below:

Although lack of possession is by default marked with the negative attributive -ni, youngerspeakers tend to negate the positive attributive -re with the standard negative marker -ñe.","[464, 465]"
"
11.2.4 Alternative questionsAn alternative type of questions is formed by a disjunction of two simple polar questions (ofwhich, the second is always negated). The final element in the alternative question is alwaysa negated verb, with rising-falling intonation. This is illustrated in (11.44-46):
(11.44) PedroS    bi-t-ePRED    oo bi-ñe-d-e?PRED
        Pedro     come-LK-3 or come-NEG-LK-3
        ‘Did Pedro come (lit. did Pedro come or didn’t he come)?’

The origin of the discourse linker oo that conjoins the two questions is unclear. It has theform of the Spanish discourse linker o meaning ‘or’. Nowadays, even the Murui elders neverdrop the linker oo in questions that involve the ‘X not X’ opposition. These alternativequestions form a single unit. They can be answered with jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ when the answer isnegative (note the function of jɨɨ is to confirm a positive or a negative value of the

Structurally, negative interrogative corresponds to positive interrogative with omittedpredicate markers used for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural (see §11.2). Positiveinterrogatives with the omitted predicate markers have the same ‘yes or no?’ readings asthose which bear such markers (see for instance (10.49) above). An example of a positiveinterrogative with omitted predicate markers is given in (10.58).

"        Nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers functioning predicatively can be markedwith the positive attributive -re to express ‘possession’, or the negative attributive -ni for itslack.

Although the expression of lack of possession is by default marked with the negativeattributive -ni, younger speakers tend to negate the positive attributive -re with the standardnegative marker -ñe. 177 Compare (5.64-65) above with (5.66) below. There is no apparentchange in meaning between predicates marked with the negative attributive -ni, as in (5.64-65), and those with the (positive) attributive -re followed by the standard negative -ñe, as in(5.66):

There are no restrictions for nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers to occur in possessivepredicative constructions. In (5.67) the head of the intransitive predicate is the ‘headless’nominal modifier bue ‘what’ which contains the interrogative buu ‘who’ (see §3.3.4 and§10.3.2):

       Q2-CLF:G-NEG.ATT-LK-1sg

      Murui elders tend to correct such uses employing structures that contain the negative attributive marker -ni.

When modifying intransitive predicates with ‘headless’ nominal modifiers as heads,pronominal subject marker has to be coreferential with the modifying pronouns, as in (5.68).","[275, 276, 277]"

12.1.3 ImperativeThe imperative clauses contains a verb marked with the imperative suffix. The imperative isused only in independent verbal clauses. Compared to its positive counterpart, Murui negatedimperative shows additional morphological complexity, having a separate prohibitive marker-no that obligatorily follows the standard negative -ñe. Positive imperatives have twodistinctions ‒ immediate and delayed; see §11.1; negative imperatives have one ‒ theprohibitive. Imperatives express fewer grammatical meanings than do the correspondingdeclaratives and interrogatives (such as the tense distinction). Constituent order in imperativeclauses is the same as that in declarative and interrogative ones (AOV/SV). This is illustratedwith the declarative in (12.24) and the imperative in (12.25):
                                                                                            490

12.2 Independent clauses and clause linking
Murui coordinated clauses express contrast/addition, and disjunction. Murui has also aconnector ie which functions as a textual anaphora and introduces main clauses by making ananaphoric reference to some information given in the preceding clause (see §13.2.3).","[514, 515]"
"
All types of negative questions can occur with either the standard negative or the negativeattributive markers. Positive interrogatives differ from the negative ones in their semantics.",[467]

      Intonation being the main marking of polar questions (as opposed to content questions) is encountered in
other languages from Amazonia, e.g. in Hixkaryana, a Carib language (Derbyshire, 1979, 1985).
289
      In many languages this is the case. As Dixon (2012: 389) put it: “(…) a person asks a question because they
want to know something. Polar questions and content questions are two ways of seeking to satisfy this want”.
                                                                                              474
11.2.1 Content questionsContent questions are considered to be questions that seek information and include aninterrogative content word (Dixon, 2012: 400). Generally, interrogative content wordsspecify a part of the proposition for which specific knowledge is sought (see §3.3.4). InMurui, an interrogative content word occurs generally in the position of the omitted coreargument and it ‘replaces’ a core-argument in a particular functional slot. This is illustrated in(11.34) where the interrogative bue ‘what’ appears in the position of an O NP argument. In(11.35) it occurs in the VCC function.

        2sg    name-CLF:INHER Q1
        ‘What is your name (lit. your name ‒ who)?’
The intonation contour of Murui content questions involves a high rising pitch (marked with↗↗) on the first syllable of the content interrogative content word followed by a fall (seeintonation contour B1 in §2.4). This is illustrated in (11.36):

        this.CTS-CLF:G Q1-CLF:G
        ‘What is this (lit. this ‒ what)?’
There is the same kind of intonation pattern as in negated content questions. An interrogativecontent word that refers to non-core arguments is usually fronted and occurs in the clause-initial position. This is illustrated in (11.37).

11.2.2 Polar questionsPolar questions are generally considered to be questions that seek an expression ofconfirmation or negation of the questioned proposition (positive and negative polarquestions). Morphology and syntax of Murui polar interrogatives are identical to those of adeclarative clause. The only true distinction between the content and polar questions (besidethe absence of the interrogative content word) is the intonation: polar questions in Murui areachieved by means of a sharply rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the predicate(content questions have a high rising pitch that falls on the first syllable of the interrogativecontent word).","[498, 499, 500]"
"While positive interrogatives are questions seeking information (‘Yes or no?’), negativeinterrogatives presuppose negative answers. There is no difference between positive andnegative interrogatives in their intonation contour. They all have the rising-falling type of
                                                                                                443
intonation which is characteristic to all types of interrogative clauses (see §2.4). Negativeinterrogative clauses and their structures are discussed in turn.","[467, 468]"
"
Murui can express possessive meanings through a special kind of verbless clause markedwith the connective ie (discussed in §5.1.3.3)
5.1.3.1 Attributive markers on predicatesThe most common way to establish a possessive relationship in Murui involves themorphological process of affixation, where the positive and negative attributive markers -reand -ni occur on a predicate whose heads can be verbs, adjectives, nouns, as well as closedword classes that form ‘headless’ nominal modifiers of all kinds. Depending on the wordclass they occur with, the attributive markers have different semantics involving ‘ability’ withverbs, ‘property’ with adjectives and ‘possession’ with nouns (see §10.1). This sectionfocuses on the attributive markers that express possession: that is, those which occur onpredicates that have nouns and nominal structures as their heads.",[275]
"        Any declarative clause may become a polar interrogative by using a subtype of arising-falling contour (B2) that involves a high rising pitch that falls on the first syllable ofthe last word of a clause and is followed by a fall. There is no distinctive intonationpatterning between positive and negative polar questions. (11.38) is an example of thepositive polar question. The sharply rising intonation is over the verb jaai(de) ‘go’:
(11.38) jo-fo-moLOC             uzu-maS                       ↗↗jaai-↘d-e?PRED
        house-CLF:CAV-LOC       grandparent-CLF:DR.M          go-LK-3
        ‘Did the grandfather go home?’
We find the same kind of intonation pattern in negative polar questions:
(11.39) aime-tai-tɨ-oPRED        iyɨ-moLOC              ↗↗gui-↘ñe-dɨ-o?PRED
        hungry-BECOME2-LK-2sg jungle.garden-LOC eat-NEG-LK-2sg
        ‘You are hungry, you didn’t eat at the jungle garden?’
Polar questions in Murui have a unique feature that other types of questions or any kind ofdeclarative clauses do not have. There is an optional omission of the verb inflection for the3rd person, e.g. jaai? (go) ‘Did (he) go?’ and jaai-ñe? (go-NEG) ‘Didn’t (he) go?’ instead of
                                                                                                                476
the normal jaai-d-e? (go-LK-3) ‘Did (he) go?’ and jaai-ñe-d-e? (go-NEG-LK-3) ‘Didn’t (he)go?’. All being the same, even in those instances, the intonation does not change.","[500, 501]"
"It is present if the speaker wants to draw extra attention of the hearer, as in (11.7) above. Ifthe imperative is directed to 2nd person dual and plural, overt pronouns are usually present(unless the plurality of referents is very salient in the context). This is shown in (11.8):
(11.8) jaa     navuida omɨko aɨma-jai!PRED
       soon evening 2du.m fish-ANDTV
       ‘In the evening you (two) go fish!’
Adjectives can be used in imperative constructions only if they are followed by the inchoativemarkers meaning ‘become’ (slot 2 on the adjective, see Scheme 3.3 in §3.1.3), e.g. uzi-nai!(hot-BECOME1) ‘warm up!’ (see §9.1). Murui allows the imperative formation with most ofthe verbs indicating states as in raaɨ! ‘sit!’. However, not all verbs can occur in theimperative constructions without a further derivation. For instance, the verb boo(de) ‘burn’can only be expressed in an imperative form when it is followed by the semelfactive -no, as
                                                                                                                   462
in bo-no! (burn-SMLF) ‘set fire, burn!’. 284           Murui has a marker -kai which co-occurs with the imperative suffix. 285 It has a uniquemeaning ‒ it has immediate imperative-like meaning. The marker -kai indicates urgency andexpectation of an immediate response. Examples are given in (11.9-11):
(11.9)       [oo moo dɨne]LOC           jaai-ño-kai!PRED

        run-IMP-RAPID
        ‘It’s already dark, let’s run quickly back home!’Such forms cannot co-occur with adverbs such as ‘slowly’. For instance, jaaiñokai ‘goquickly’ from example (11.9) cannot be followed by the adverb feekuize ‘slowly’. Themarker of rapid action -kai is special in that it obligatorily derives imperative forms fromirregular verbs. That is, verbs which have irregular imperative forms cannot occur with theimperative -no unless they take -kai, as illustrated in (11.12):
(11.12) bii! (come) ‘come’ (irregular form)
        bii-ño-kai (come-IMP-RAPID) ‘come quickly!’
        *bii-ño! (come-IMP)
        *bii-kai! (come-RAPID)
284
      It is possible that verbs with stative meanings or low agentivity of the S/A argument might not be used in
imperative imperatives. This requires further investigation.
285
      Elsewhere on the verbal structure, the marker -kai has inceptive meanings (see §7.2.2.5). The marker of rapid
action -kai and the inceptive -kai are different types of markers that occur in different slots on the verb.
                                                                                            463
There is no dedicated negative counterpart of the canonical imperative. There is a singleprohibitive form for all negative imperatives, which are expressed on the verb by the standardnegative -ñe followed by the privative marker -no; such constructions have prohibitivereadings (see also §10.2.3 on negative imperatives). Negative imperatives show no delayed‒immediate imperative distinction. An example of a negative imperative is given in (11.13):
(11.13) uai-ñe-noPRED                  oo-ɨe-ñe-d-e=zaPRED
        get.ANDTV-NEG-PRIV.PROH 2sg-GEN-NEG-LK-3=UNCERT
        ‘Don’t take (lit. get it) away! It’s not yours.’
Canonical imperatives display variation in their ‘strength’. The imperatives which areexpressed by verbal roots, followed by the imperative -no, and aspectual markers, areconsidered to be the ‘weakest’ in their strength. Those which occur with imperative,directional, and rapid action markers are understood as more coercive. A brief overview thestrength of Murui cannonical imperatives is given in Table 11.2.","[486, 487, 488]"
"       The influence of Spanish on Murui morphology is less apparent than that on the onphonology, or the lexical ‘inventory’ of the language. Nevertheless, one can say that thespeech of young speakers is in a stage of change. An example of this is the negation of thepositive attributive marker -re which in the speech of innovative Murui speakers can benegated with the standard negative -ñe; in the speech of the elders such negation isungrammatical (see §5.1.3.1). Another example is the use of the differential object marker -na, which in the speech of young people is somewhat more ‘loosely’ used (see §6.2). The useof Murui ‘dedicated’ comparative constructions (§9.2) is yet another example. Monoclausalcomparative constructions types (that are somewhat similar to those in Spanish) are usedmore frequently by younger speakers; older speakers tend to use biclausal constructions. Thespeech of young speakers is full of Spanish discourse markers and linkers such as pero(Spanish for ‘but’) and y (Spanish for ‘and’). The speech of Mesia Magallanes Ordoñez (Text5 in the Appendix) is a case in point.
                                                                                                                547
13.5.2 Loanwords and calques from SpanishSpanish loanwords in Murui are numerous; the aversion to ‘language mixing’ reported forVaupés (see Aikhenvald 2002, Epps 2006, and others) is absent among the People of theCentre cultural area. 321 Loanwords are typically adopted phonologically in the speech ofMurui elders, as in epejo for Spanish espejo ‘mirror’, but not in the speech of youngerspeakers (see §2.6). An example of application of native morphology is given in (13.64),where the Spanish tieda ‘store’ (phonologically adopted) is followed by the native pluralform -ɨaɨ. 322(13.64) tieda-ɨaɨ
        store.Sp-PL
        ‘stores’
In general, Murui speakers are fully aware which words are ‘truly’ Murui, and which not. Afew words from Spanish appear to have been nativized (and, therefore, are not considered tobe Spanish loans), such as pe(te) ‘kick’ (possibly from Spanish patear ‘kick’). The mostfrequent Spanish loanwords in Murui are illustrated in Table 13.1. 323 Note that borrowednouns can easily take some nominal morphology (such as number marking, as in (13.64)above). Borrowed verbs typically occur with the nominalizers, that can be followed bysequential marker, as the nominalizer maneja-ja (operate-E.NMLZ) ‘operating’ in example(13.73) in §13.5.3.","[571, 572]"

Examples (10.11-16) present the standard negative -ñe following the causative -ta, and anumber of mood, and aspectual markers. Note that -ñe always precedes the future tensemarking; negation is therefore closer to the root than the tense marking (see §7.1).

      Word final vowel centralization (V > /ɨ/) and vowel lengthening (/i/ > /iii/) occurs in songs, ritual narrations
and calling (in the distance) but not in everyday speech. These phenomena are very frequent in commands
shouted in the distance (but also occur in questions and statements). They are always accompanied by the
special type of rising intonation contour (see §2.4).

Focused clausal constituents in biclausal constructions are usually topicalized. In suchconstructions topic markers occur on constituents of clauses with positive polarity (seeexample (6.37) in §6.2.1.2).","[459, 460, 461]"
"The preferred order for the constituents in verbless clauses is generally VCS ‒ VCC (carried

7.2.3.1 Attitudinal modalitiesThe grammatical categories of Murui attitudinal modality cover people’s desirability of statesof affair (the desiderative) and apprehension that may or will happen in the future (theapprehensive).

A. DESIDERATIVE -aka ‒ desiderative modality is expressed by means of the suffix -aka (slot8), as illustrated in (7.101-102) (see also T1.39 and T2.84 in the Appendix). The desiderativemarker is not restricted to any tense, aspect, modality (excluding obligation), andevidentiality specifications.

B. APPREHENSIVE -iza ‒ Murui has a marker which indicates apprehension or dread ofsomething that may or will happen in the future and is an attempt to do something so as toavoid the feared entity, an action, or an event. 227 The apprehensive modality is marked withthe suffix -iza (or -za following /i/) (slot 15). Its syntactic scope is the main clause, and it isavailable for the first and the 2nd person (cf. as it is the case for Murui canonical and non-canonical imperatives, see §11.1). Examples of the apprehensive are given below. In (7.108),a child called Rata was walking over a high tree trunk in the jungle, and a man warned her:
(7.108) Rata! [jadi-e            ra-egɨ]S                rɨfɨ-re-d-e!PRED                  uai-za!PRED
        Rata this.CTH-CLF:G thing-CLF:?OVAL.BIG slippery-ATT-LK-3                          fall-APPR
        ‘Rata! This tree trunk is slippery! Be careful, you might fall!’
The apprehensive does not distinguish whether an action is controlled or not. That is, awarning ‘be careful, you might fall’ and ‘be careful with you jumping!’ is marked in the samefashion. In the following example, a child was trying to lick the liquid tobacco. Liquidtobacco is a powerful intoxicant. An elder warned him:
227
      The apprehensive modality marker has been attested in other Amazonian languages, such as those of the
Carib family (Derbyshire, 1979), Takanan (Vuillermet, 2013), Arawak (Aikhenvald 2003), and Nambiquara
(Eberhard 2009).
                                                                                                                 353

Murui apprehensive can be negated with the standard negative -ñe (e.g. ɨba-ñe-iza!(buy-NEG-APPR) ‘be careful, they might not buy!’) with the negative attributive -ni (e.g.maka-ni-za! (walk-NEG.ATT-APPR) ‘be careful, you might not be able to walk!). Theapprehensive rarely co-occurs only with markers of non-spatial setting (see Table 7.4 in §7.4for restrictions on its co-occurrence). One of the most frequently co-occurring markers withthe apprehensive is the durative marker -ri, as in (7.110):
(7.110) [jɨaɨ-ma        jo-fo-mo]LOC         maka-ri-za!PRED
        other-CLF:DR.M house-CLF:CAV-LOC walk-DUR-APPR
        ‘Be careful walking into somebody’s (male’s) house!’
7.2.3.2 AbilityMurui has two grammatical markers on verbs expressing ability or its lack: the positiveattributive -re ‘having capability to, being allowed to’ and the negative attributive -ni ‘nothaving capability to, not being allowed to’ (slot 11, see also §10.1 on differences in meaningof the attributive markers with nouns, verbs, and adjectives). 228 Compare the followingexamples:

Murui speakers (instead of being negative with the negative atttibutive -ni) (see Chapter 10).

The speech of some younger Murui tends to differ from that of Murui elders. To express the‘lack of ability’ meanings, they negate the positive attributive marker -re with the standardnegative marker -ñe, as in (10.27a). Murui elders occasionally correct such usage byemploying the negative attributive -ni, as in (10.27b). (10.27a-b) is an excerpt from adialogue between a father and his son.

The attributive markers -re and -ni occur on all types of adjectives which function as heads ofintransitive predicates. They denote ‘(lack of) property, attribution’. The use of adjectives asheads of intransitive predicates is de facto the most common way to express attribution in thelanguage (see §9.1 on verb-like and noun-like functions of adjectives and their ‘temporal’ vs.‘timeless property’ semantics). (10.28-29) below are examples of the adjective rozi- ‘cold’and ebi- ‘nice’ followed by the negative attribution marker -ni.

Occasionally, ebi-ni-d-e (nice-NEG.ATT-LK-3) ‘not nice, amusing’, as in (10.29), can also benegated with the standard negative marker -ñe following the positive attributive -re. Usessuch as ebi-re-ñe-d-e (nice-ATT-NEG-LK-3) for ‘not nice, amusing’ are characteristic of thespeech of young Murui, and are considered to be incorrect by Murui elders.","[462, 463, 464]"

11.2.3 Tag questionsMurui tag question are characterised by the presence of a special tag words erua meaning‘really’. Among younger speaker of Murui, the form ua ‘really’ seems to be usedinterchangeably but the form erua is nevertheless more frequently used as a tag word. 290 Bothtag words are added after a statement which has a normal declarative intonation. The tagsform separate intonation units, and have a sharply rising intonation. Murui tag questions aregenerally used in positive polar questions when a speaker predicts that the statement iscorrect and seeks agreement from the addressee. Examples of erua and ua are given in(11.40-41) (see also T2.24 and T2.27 in the Appendix).
(11.40) bi-mɨeVCS            [Pedro dofora-to     jito]VCC                         ↗↗e↘rua?

             CONN     quick.ATT finish-LK-CLF:G really
             ‘It’s finished quickly, hasn’t it?’
The origin of erua is likely to be the nominalised eru-a (see-E.NMLZ) ‘seeing’ (cf. the verbero(de) ‘see’). However, the two tag words can also be used in contexts where ‘seeing’ is notinvolved: 291
(11.42) [ziyɨ-na       jazikɨ-mo      ñaɨ-a-na]O                  kaka-dɨ-oPRED erua?

        ‘You have heard the bird talking in the forest, haven’t you?’
290
      Elsewhere in the language the free form ua is an intensifier (see §3.3.1). Erua does not have such a function.
291
      This is possibly a semantic extension of ‘seeing’.
                                                                                               477
Negative questions rarely occur with the tag words. When this happens however, there is nochange in their intonation patterns. The following example illustrates that the tag erua has thesame sharply rising intonation as the tag would have in any positive question:
(11.43) [Pedro nokae-do]INS jaai-ñe-dɨ-omoɨPRED ↗↗eru↘a?
        Pedro canoe-INS        go-NEG-LK-2pl         see.really
        ‘You did not go by Pedro’s canoe, didn’t you?’
The tag forms erua and ua can also stand on their own. It is common to use both forms tosustain conversations and let the speaker continue (see examples T2.15, T2.31, and T2.45,T2.51, T2.70 in the Appendix and §13.3.2 on the use of ua in discourse).","[501, 502]"
"The form of the standard negative -ñe is always the same, regardless of verb’s transitivity,marking, etc. The following examples (10.6-10) illustrate verbs negated with the standardnegative marker.",[459]

7.3   Spatial settingMurui has two distinct direction markers, the andative and the ventive, by which the languageexplicitly encodes the shift in the orientation to the reference point, the speaker. Spatialsetting of a clause is typically shown with oblique noun phrases, adverbs, and demonstratives.",[391]
"
7.2     Non-spatial setting ‒ general remarks
Non-spatial setting meanings are expressed through suffixes on the verb (see §9.1 for‘shared’ suffixes with adjectives), although vowel lengthening of verbal roots (in addition toa tense marker) can also be used to express future and high intensity meanings. Further,Murui has a number of independent lexical time words which can co-occur with non-spatialsetting (TAME) markers. In Murui, aspect is a more prominent category than tense, modality,or evidentiality. A complete list of the Murui TAME markers, their semantics, and co-occurrences are given in Table 7.3 at the end of this section and Table 7.4 in §7.4.
                                                                                                 321
           The verbal category of tense in Murui is manifested as a binary opposition betweennon-future and future. 210 The non-future tense is the unmarked ‘default’ verb form which isfound in a main clause of the declarative, interrogative, and imperative mood, regardless ofits polarity. When expressing the time specification present vs. past, Murui relies on lexicaltime words, such as jai ‘already’ or jaa ‘soon’ (§7.2.1.3). The future tense, marked by thesuffix -i(t)ɨ and/or vowel lengthening of verbal roots, is found in the declarative andinterrogative mood and does not extend to the imperative mood (note, however, that Muruihas a grammatical category of ‘immediate imperative’ expressed by the rapid action -kai, see§11.1.1). Tense in main clauses is absolute and always involves time specification (either the‘unmarked’ non-future or the future tense markers). There is no grammatical marking ofrelative tense in subordinate clauses. Some subordinate clauses involving eventnominalizations have time specification (non-future vs. future, such as the future eventnominalizer -ye, which can also have ‘obligative’ meanings, see §7.2.3.3). Others, such asrelative clauses, lack time specification and their interpretations are dependent on themeaning of the verb of the main clause.","[345, 346]"

Another frequent way of answering one’s question is the ‘confirmative’ interjection jɨɨ that isused when a speaker ‘agrees’ with the value of the preposition. Simply saying, depending onthe polarity of the verb in the question, jɨɨ will be interpreted as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Theelement in focus, or even a whole clause, may or may not be repeated.

A2. NOUN-LIKE UNDERIVED ADJECTIVES THAT CANNOT FUNCTION AS FREE FORMS ‒ twounderived adjectives that are bound forms, and have to take the generic classifier -e tofunction as a modifier within an NP, e.g. [eo jakaɨ-e jaai-ra]NP (very old-CLF:G go-CLF:G)‘very old ladder’:
DIMENSION:           jedakɨ- ‘thick’
AGE:                 jakaɨ- ‘old’
Similarly to underived adjectives A1, underived adjectives A2 take the generic classifier -ewhen they function as modifiers within an NP, as in (9.3).
                                                                                                                403

      maybe old-CLF:G dog ANA.SP-CLF:CAV-LOC fall-LK-3
      ‘Maybe the old dog fell into that hole…’
Such noun-like underived adjectives can also be used as ‘headless’ nominal modifiers, e.g.jedakɨ-roi (thick-CLF:CLOTHES) ‘thick (clothes)’. When the adjective jakaɨ- ‘old’ functions asa nominal modifier, its form is reduced to jaka-, as in jaka-ko (old-CLF.REP:DOG) ‘old(dog)’. 254
A3. NOUN-LIKE LEXICALIZED ADJECTIVES – Synchronically, there are two adjectives whichobligatorily contain the positive attributive marker -re, but have many of morphosyntacticproperties of underived adjectives (i.e. they can neither head intransitive predicates nor canthey occur with the negative attributive -ni) but not all (i.e. they do not occur with the genericclassifier -e). Two adjectives belong to this class:
VALUE:                        mare ‘good’
PHYSICAL PROPERTY:            aare ‘long, far’
The adjective mare ‘good’ is unusual in that under negation, it undergoes a uniquephonological change ‒ rather than *mare-ñe-d-e, the negated form of mare is maraiñe-d-e(good.ATT.NEG-LK-3) (see §10.3).","[427, 428]"
"       The semantics of the attributive markers -re and -ni with adjectives is different fromthose of verbs. They involve ‘ability’ with verbs (‘can’ and ‘cannot’) but ‘property’ withadjectives (‘having the property’ and ‘not having the property’, see §10.1). This is illustratedwith the abilitative readings on the verb kue(te) ‘write’ in (9.8) (the O NP argument is notstated). This is unlike the example with an adjective in (9.9); the meaning of the adjectivekaɨmare(de) ‘tasty’ has no abilitative overtones.

Unlike verbs, (verb-like) adjectives can be marked with the suffix -oi to denote ‘half, a littlebit’. There is a homophonous durative -oi on verbs but it occurs in a different structuralposition (see Scheme 3.2 in §3.1.3) and has different semantics. On adjectives -oi follows thepositive attributive -re, e.g. kaɨma-re-oi-d-e (happy-ATT-HALF-LK-3) ‘half-happy’, naime-re-
                                                                                                   408
oi-d-e (sweet-ATT-HALF-LK-3) ‘half-sweet’. There is no marker for verbs that would mean‘half, a little bit’ (see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1). An example is given in (9.10):
(9.10) [kaɨ jo-fo]S         jea-re-oi-d-e-mo                                 nai-makɨS

       come-LK-3
       ‘When our house was half-dirty, they arrived.’
Verb-like adjectives differ also from verbs in the form of nominalizers. In addition to theattributive markers, adjectives are nominalized with -na, as illustrated in (9.11). Nominalizerson verbs have the forms -a, -ja, and -ya (-na on verbs occurs only when it follows thestandard negative -ñe, see §3.1.4 on nominalizations):
(9.11) [KataA [izi-do                  izi-re-na]]        okui-d-ePRED
       Kata    tooth-CLF:POINTED       painful-ATT-E.NMLZ endure-LK-3
       ‘Kata endures the pain of the tooth.’
Adjectives have also a number of specific inchoative markers of sorts (-nai, -tai, and -dai)which do not occur on verbs (see Scheme 3.3 in §3.1.3). All of them refer to ‘becoming’ (interms of having characteristics of a feature denoted by the semantics of the root) that oftentranslates into English as ‘getting’. 258 Examples are given below:

B2. FORMATION OF ADVERBS – most of the adverbs have adjectival origin. Such adverbsconsist just of an adjectival root and the positive attributive -re, and obligatorily occur in thepre-verbal position, as in (9.19). Such formations are not possible for the majority of Muruiverbs.

B3. INABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE MAJORITY OF VERBAL CONSTRUCTIONS – an importantdistinction between verbs and adjectives in Murui is the occurrence of verbs in imperative,passive, and causative constructions. This also includes the standard negative marker -ñe andclause linking markers that are not available for adjectives. Verbs can be negated by both thestandard negative marker -ñe and by the negative attributive -ni (for ‘lack of ability’). Verb-like adjectives can only be negated by suffixing the negative attributive marker -ni to the root.","[432, 433, 434, 435]"

      Compare with example (13.15) that illustrates direct speech reports with no code-switching.

B1. CODE MIXING AND INTERJECTIONS – the Spanish negative word no is frequently used inMurui, as illustrated in (13.67). The positive sí ‘yes’ is almost never ‘switched’ (theinterjection jɨɨ! is used instead). 326

      Alternatively, those linkers could be considered as loans (especially those for which equivalents do not exist
in Murui) (Aikhenvald & Dixon, 2006: 333-334).

In (13.72), entonces ‘so/then’ is a continuation of speaker’s turn and establishes a cause-result link between the two ideas, ‘having no choice but co-existing with white people’ and‘beginning to live like white people’.

In (13.73) there is a specific discourse marker este (lit. ‘this’) ‘that is’ that occurs when aspeaker takes time to ‘search’ for a word or an expression. 328 Throughout a dialogue, thespeaker is very careful to use ‘only Murui language’. In the third clause, este is followed by apause and introduces komputadora manejaja ‘operating a computer’ (which on its own is aborrowing from Spanish). The speaker takes time to think if there is a way to express this inMurui.","[575, 576, 577]"
