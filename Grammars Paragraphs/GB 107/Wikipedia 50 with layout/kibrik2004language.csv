      Auxiliary verbs are compatible with different mood values: (10a) exemplifies
the indicative, (10b) the optative, (10c) the conjunctive, and (10d) the potential.
      See 2.1.5 below for a discussion of the n e g a t i v e a n a l y t i c a l f o r m s .
      Besides the regular auxiliaries, the verb n@al- ‘become’ 90 may also function as     90
       A single example has also been documented with the auxiliary verb awwav- ‘leave’ in the
context of the lexical motion verb:
                                                   63
an auxiliary, indicating the starting point of the event expressed by the negative form
of the lexical verb:(11) a. ...palJlJa           yllygy-n                 it-ka           ny@al-i.

            [22:32]2.1.5. Negative forms
Besides the positive verb forms described above, there are negative forms. Verbal
negation can be expressed by the following means:
       (1) combination of the negative particle with the regular finite form of the verb;
       (2) combination of the negative particle with the deverbal predicative (a-...ka);
       (3) combination of the negative particle with the analytical form derived from
the deverbal predicative;
       (4) the analytical form, derived from the negative analytical representation
(nuN-...-a/-ta);
       (5) circumfixes tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in (the latter is identical to the
caritive adjective (see 2.2.2) marker. It is compatible with the negative particle).
       Now we will consider the negative forms in detail.
       Type (1) is found only for the desirable moods — optative and conjunctive. In
this case the negative (more precisely, the prohibitive) particle qytymmy 91 is used.
(i)   to       vitga         g-awwav-laN                vyly-NNy...
      and      at.once       RES-leave-RES+3pl.S        go.out.on.the.shore-ANLT
      And at once they went out on the shore... [22:28]
      91
       It is interesting to note that the negative particle qytymmy is also compatible with nouns,
cf. gymmy wiwnyN ty-t-awwavy-N, qytymmy korfa-N ‘I will arrive at Vyvenka rather than in
Korf’. However in general nouns are more often combined with the negative noun alval@in ‘not
that, another’ rather than with qytymmy, cf. gymnan ty-gita-tky-n qajunJunJu, alval@in
NavysqatpilJ ‘I look at the boy rather than at the girl.’
                                                 64
(12) a. qytymmy              my-vitaty-k!
        not                  1sg.S+OPT-work-1sg.S+PF

"
      Type (2) has two realizations. In combination with the negative particle ally, it
contrasts with the positive forms of the real moods. In combination with the particle
kytvy(l), it represents the prohibitive as a negative correlate of optative/imperative.(13) a. ...Hatav       gym-nan              ally        a-la@u-ka.
          only       I-ERG            not          A-see-PRED`
        {LC: Before the Japanese people appeared here long ago.} Only I didn't see (them).
        [32:3]    b. ...kytvyl             gytty            a-wintat-ka            tynJnJy=svi.sity-k...

        ... Don't you dare help saw the tusks. [16:13]
     In type (2) reduction of the negative marker is possible (the negative particle is
absent):(14) a. ...Navaq       a-jyl-ka               tyrup=tyrgy-tyr,
          if         A-give-PRED`           Teruppe=meat-NOM+SG

                                                   65
     Type (3) is the analytical extension of type (2) for real moods. Both full and
reduced realizations are possible.(15) a. ally         tinga     a-jyl-ka                na-nty-gym.
         not         what      A-give-PRED`            LOW.A-do-1sg.P
         They didn't give me anything. [10:32]    b. ...nura.q       a-jyl-ka                                 na-nty-gym.

         ...I hadn't been married for a long time. [32:13]      Type (4) uses a negative analytical representation of the lexical verb as a basic
structural element in combination with the optative auxiliary verb. This type is a
negative correlate of the optative. Optionally the presence of a negative particle is
possible.(16) а. kytvyl         nuNy-nm-a          myny-nty-nat.
         must.not      NEG-kill-ANLT         1nsg.A+OPT-do-3du.P
         We don't have to kill them. [20:35]    b. nuN-ta.ly@u.Ny-sqiv-a              myny-nty-nawwi.
         NEG-look.for-go-ANLT             1nsg.A+OPT-do-3pl.P
         Let's not go to look for them. [6:14]
       Type (5) is formed by means of circumfixes. First we have tymNi-...-a/-ta,
deriving the negative correlate of the supine (verbal nominal) (see 2.1.6.2 below). The
prefix part of the circumfix coincides with the root of the verb ‘be lost’ (i.e. not to
exist in the real world), the suffix part coincides with the marker of verbal analytical
representation (see the preceding type). This negative form refers to a situation whose
non-existence is a goal of the action expressed by the main clause (see 2.1.6.2).
       Second, a-…-kyl@in circumfix is used for the derivation of the negative form,
and then the negative particle ally is added. In contrast to other forms this type is a
deverbal attributive. There are grounds to interpret this form as a negative correlate of
the deverbal adjective (n-...-qin); see 2.1.2.(17) a. ...wutt.in           gyrnik                    ally     a-viHy-kyl@in ...

participles.","[65, 66, 67]"

auxiliary depends on the (in)transitivity of the lexical verb: intransitive verbs are
combined with the auxiliary ‘be’ and transitive verbs with the auxiliary ‘do, have’.
      The analytical forms have positive as well as negative polarity. The lexical verb
inside p o s i t i v e a n a l y t i c a l f o r m s has the suffix marker -a/-ta (identical to the
ergative marker). There is also the suffix marker -N, see (9b), identical to the dative
marker. These forms are almost impossible outside of analytical verb forms; therefore
their converbal (see below) interpretation is not desirable 88 . We will refer to them as
the analytical form of the lexical verb 89 (glossed as ANLT).
      The following are examples with intransitive verb:(9) a. tury-pkir-a                      g-il-laNina,
             just-arrive-ANLT        RES-be-RES+3pl.S

       88
       There are two textual examples contradicting this interpretation that deserve a special
mention:(i)     kyrgy=nJu-ta               mimly-k        na-ntu-tky-nawwi.

        or      eat.directly-ANLT       1nsg.A-wash.down-LQIV-IPF-3pl.P
        {LC: We make soup,} or after eating them directly (we) begin to wash them down...
        [33:31]      -a/-ta form, according translation, is used here as a converb, however in both cases the
subordinate as well as main verbs are the same: ‘eat’ and ‘wash down’. There is an assumption
that in this case the -a/-ta form is not a free one, but it is a part of idiomatic expression signifying
‘to eat and drink simultaneously’.
      89
         The analytical representation permits negative polarity, nuN- prefix marker being added;
see 2.1.5.","[61, 62]"

and mood being fixed, 63 person-number forms.
      The conjugation of the intransitive verb ‘jump’ and the transitive verb ‘beat’ are
presented in Appendix. The linear structure of the finite verb form is presented in
Table 1. The nucleus of the form is its verb stem. It has the zero rank. Morpheme
slots that precede the stem (prefixes) have negative rank numbers increasing from
right to left. The slots following the stem (suffixes) have positive rank numbers
increasing from left to right.","[41, 42]"
"2.1.6.2. The supine is derived from the verb stem by means of the marker -nvyN. It is
used in the context of motion verbs as well as of other verbs where the expression of
goal is necessary (see (18a-c)). If the goal of the main action is prevention rather than
accomplishment of an action, the negative correlate of the supine is used (tymNi-...-a/-

affixes similar to the spatial cases. Converbs do not have any inflectional categories.",[67]

     It is also used for the formation of the analytical negative (see 2.1.4).
     The imperative is formed by means of the circumfix ga-...-a/-ta 86 . Imperative
forms do not have the aspectual values, and lack regular personal markers 87 .
Nevertheless the imperative has restricted inflectional devices. First, it has number
agreement with a 1-2nd person argument identical to that of the polypersonal
conjugation (the marker -la, see 2.1.1.2.5). Second, it has 1sg P-argument agreement
by means of the inversion marker -ina, see 2.1.1.2.3. For example:(7) a. ...g-awwav-a                    rara-N ...
            IMPR-leave-IMPR            house-DAT

           ... from now on kill reindeer for me. [20:97]
      As (7b) shows, the imperative is compatible with incorporation.
      There are also analytical imperative forms containing the lexical verb with the
predicative marker a-...-ka and the auxiliary marked as imperative:(8)    am-oji-ka         g-ity-lqiv-a.
       A-lip-CARIT       IMPR-be-LQIV-IMPR
       Shut up [=be silent]. [20:68]2.1.4. Analytical verb forms
Besides the synthetic verb forms described above analytical forms are also possible.
They include a lexical verb and an auxiliary as the bearer of verbal inflectional
categories. There are the auxiliary verbs it- ‘be’ and t/n.t- ‘do, have’. The choice of
      86
         Variant -ta occurs after final full vowel stems, and variant -a — after final consonant or
final y stem.
      87
         It is natural to suppose that the prefix and suffix parts of the imperative marker occupy the
personal S/A/P-slots of verb form (ranks -4 and +4). It is also possible to regard the imperative as
derived from umnarked perfective stem.","[59, 60, 61]"

"2.3. Nouns
The semantic and syntactic functions of a noun are expressed mostly by the items of
nominal grammatical categories (case-number marking and person-number marking –
see 2.3.1.1, 2.3.1.2 and 2.3.2), in some cases by derivative markers of location
(2.3.1.3) and adjectivization (2.3.3); some local functions are expressed outside a
locative noun by means of adpositions (2.3.1.3). Nouns are used either
a u t o n o m o u s l y or in i n c o r p o r a t i o n . Being used autonomously, a noun is
marked for a set of grammatical categories. Incorporated nouns are just bare stems,
without any category markers.
        The set of grammatical categories a noun is inflected for depends on its
syntactic position in a sentence. Three types of noun forms are distinguished on the
morphological level: nominal, predicative and adjectival. The n o m i n a l form is
used in the position of an actant, the p r e d i c a t i v e form − in the position of a
predicate, the a d j e c t i v a l form − in the position of an attribute.",[93]

2.1.7. The values of some verbal categories
2.1.7.1. Indicative
The indicative refers to the events belonging to the real world, i.e. events that took or
are taking place. Temporal deixis of respective forms is secondary. The perfective
usually describes events that took place before the speech act, see (27a). The
imperfective is neutral to the temporal axis. It can be used for events proceeding
during the speech act as well as prolonged incompleted events before the speech act,
see (27b):(27) a. wutt.in         itt-i             ynkyjap,        nJy.mqy.saN.ki.
          this+3sg      be-3sg.S+PF       long.ago        in.one's.childhood
          This occurred long ago in (my) childhood. [37:1]       b. naqamx@at         tyHyly-tkyn      pyttuNy-l@y-n.

          nymy.l@y-n.                 ynnanu           tyHyly-tkyn.
          Nemelen-NOM+SG              always           be.sick-IPF
          {LC: And Qisgayat could not recover.} (This) rich man was sick all the time. (Аnd well
          this) Nemelen had numerous herds. (And) he was sick all the time. {RC: After that it
          already began to snow} [29:8-10]
      The imperfective also describes prolonged events that continuously take place
or are repeated. Thus, texts 25-28, describing traditional customs, abound in
indicative imperfective forms, for example:(28)      jaqi       myty-lHita-lqivy-tkyn,               varanJ-nJaq
          later      1nsg.S-hold.a.race-LQIV-IPF          people-AUGM+NOM+SG
          igu-tkyn          Hita-l@y-N.
          gather-IPF        hold.a.race-ATR-DAT
          Well, we hold a race. People gather at the place of the race. [25:1]
       Repeated action can refer to the past:
                                                  71
(29)     Nynvys.saN        gymmy           ty-walqivy-lqivy-k                to         numal

         LOW.A-carry-IPF-1sg.P          school-DAT
         I had run away many times (before), but every time [=again] I was returned to school.
         [37:5]
      In (29) both actions are repeated, however the first verb (‘run away’) has
perfective marking, and the second one (‘carry’) — imperfective marking. This is
because the first action is punctual and the second is prolonged.
      In analytical negative forms relating to the temporal domain of the definite
future the auxiliary verb can have imperfective marking:(30) ...ally      a-pilg.at-ka             il-la-tkyni-tyk.
       not        A-get.hungry-PRED`       be-PLUR-IPF-2nsg.S
        {LC: Wait! A little later, don't hurry. Later you will eat well, you will be full and} will
        not be (left) hungry. [11:10]2.1.7.2. Potential
Potential means that the event P does not belong to the world of real events,
nevertheless P can potentially be in this world. This event does not have any
epistemic restrictions. It is quite natural that this type of event is closely related to
events that, in languages with the grammatical category of tense, pertain to future.
Therefore in most cases potential verb forms are translated as future forms:(31)     vitga           lygyrNy-n                  ga-kumn.al-lin:
         at.once         Legerngen-NOM+SG           RES-shout-RES+3sg.S

         Legerngen there and then exclaimed,         e will take away this walrus (from you) .
         [22:20]2.1.7.3. Optative
The optative, like the conjunctive, pertains to moods that refer to the mental state of
the speaker. The prototypical properties of the optative are the following:
      — the speaker is thinking about a virtual event P;
                                               72
      — the speaker wants event P to be performed;
      — the speaker highly estimates the reality of the approach of the event P;
      — the speaker is talking about this.
      The speaker's capability to control the approach of event P depends on the
person of the active participant (actor) of this event.
      In the context of the 1sg actor (identical to the speaker) the optative, along with
the speaker/actor's wish for the performance of event P, refers to his intention or wish
to accomplish it:(32)      maja?         my-n.sis@aty-n.
          where         1sg.A+OPT-look-3sg.P
          {LC: Miti says that she gave birth to his child. Qutkinnaqu:} Where? I will take a look.

          Perhaps, I will not give you all the meat. [10:46](34)      qy-Na.lqiv-gi,                                   nymaqav,

          1sg.A+OPT-shoulder-2sg.P
          Sit down, (that's) enough, I will carry you on (my) back. [4:9]      The usage of the 1pl optative is analogous: the optative refers to the speaker's
intention to perform an action and his address to the listener to do this together with
him:(35) a. ...myn-meNy=tkyply-la-n,                      myn-Halap-la-n.
           1nsg.A+OPT-hard=beat-PLUR-3sg.P              1nsg.A+OPT-catch.up.with-PLUR-3sg.P
          {LC: Ah, that's just him.} Let's beat him hard, let's catch him. [8:53]       b. qutkinJnJaqu,                  gemat·qi          myn-ra.mk.isi-myk
          Qutkinnaqu+NOM+SG              maybe             1nsg.S+OPT-pay.a.visit-1nsg.S+PF
          rara-N.
          house-DAT
                                                 73
          Qutkinnaqu, maybe we will go (and) visit (my) home. [7:24]       c. nuN-alu-sqiv-a                      myn-ity-tkyn.
          NEG-pick.berries-go-ANLT            1nsg.S+OPT-be-IPF
          We won't have to go picking berries. [7:18]
      It the context of a 3rd person S/A-argument, the optative refers to the speaker's
wish that the event in question happens to that 3rd person:(36)      qygi       taqy=trup=kiwyl                          ny-@-ity-n,
          look!      what=Teruppe=blood+NOM+SG                3.S+OPT-be-3sg.S
          ynN.in        gym.nin       HiN.valJ=kiwyl.
          this+3sg      my+3sg        nostril=blood+NOM+SG
          {LC:     hy is this blood bad? , said Miti.} You see, it would be good if this were
          Teruppe's blood, but this is blood from my nose. [10:29]
      This example convincingly testifies to the failure of an imperative interpretation
of these forms in the 3rd person. In the context of the 3rd person, the subject of the
wish does not have to coincide with the speaker.(37)      a-Neqy-ka            wut¥ku tig-uwwi                     ny-tkiv-na(-wwi).
          A-bad-PRED           here       ski-NOM+PL               3.S+OPT-spend.the.night-3pl.S
          It's bad if the skis spend the night here. [12:6]In the dialogue the speaker (the man) presupposes that the hearer (the bear) wishes
the skis had stayed home at night.","[70, 71, 72, 73, 74]"
"
       114
         Cf. the English pronoun what used attributively in phrases like what book?.
       115
         Actually, there exists an interrogative pronoun derived from the root {taq} by means of
the suffix -in(a), that is the pronoun {taq.in(a)}. However, it is used only to denote the object of
certain verbs of speech such as ‘say, speak (about smth.)’ in an interrogative sentence, cf. taq.in
ynN.ina iv-la-t? ‘What did they say?’ [10:48]

2.3.1.3. Local semantic functions
A noun phrase can also express different types of location (location with respect to
the object expressed by a base noun). These functions are expressed either by a
derivative suffix (in the case there is a contact between the objects or at least it is
implied) or by an adposition governing the locative noun phrase (in the case there is
no obvious contact between the objects), for details see [Muravyova 1994].
       In order to express functions of the first type, a nominal derivative with a
locative suffix is used. In general, such derivatives have complete paradigms
including the nominative, but the most frequent forms are cases with locative
functions, such as the locative, the dative (with an allative function), the lative and the
prolative.
       The following local functions are expressed by means of suffixes:
       SUPER ‘surface of an object’, the marker -lq (with the variant -lJq), for
instance: Najy-lJqy-N ‘(climb) the mountain’ [8:38], gytgy-lq-epyN ‘(migrate) along
the surface of the lake’ [16:7], ujatiki-lJqy-k ‘(load smth.) on the sledge’ [22:66],
vylJusa-lJqy-k ‘(put smth.) on a dish’ [29:27];
       IN ‘inner part of an object’, the marker -giN, for instance: ulJgyv-giN-ki ‘in the
grave’ [5:10], ulJgyv-giN-gypyN ‘(shout) from the grave’ [7:59], syge-giN-ki ‘(hide) in
the sands’ [18:18], tygar-giN-kyN ‘(go) inside the store-hole’ [21:73];
       INTER ‘place among objects’, the marker -swyn/-lwyn, for instance: tumykka-
lwyny-k ‘(to talk about smth.) in the presence of other people’ [22:68], ra.mky-swyn-
i ‘(to visit) all the houses’ [28:2], Ne-swyny-k ‘(to live) among the mountains’ [32:4];
                                                 101
       APUD ‘place near an object’, the marker -teny, for instance: ra-teny-k ‘(to
dance) by the neighbouring house’ [39:4], inmy-teny-k ‘(to build a village) near the
cliff’ [23:3], ynykka-teny-k ‘(to put smth.) near himself’ [29:21].
       If there is no obvious contact between the two objects, adpositions 108
expressing various local functions are used (they govern the locative case form), cf.
ymiNqal tynupy-k ‘behind a hill’, ujatiki-k gytulNyNqal ‘at the side of a sledge’,
rymetyNqal tynupy-k ‘far behind a hill’, inmy-k telyNqal ‘on the other side of a rock’,
tilirra-k semyk ‘near Tilirran {the village Tilichiki}’.","[101, 102]"
"
     112
         Some demonstratives may be used as bare roots, without any suffixes. In such cases they
are referred to as demonstrative particles, cf. Nan ‘there’ (particle) – Nanin ‘that’ (pronominal
adjective).

                              CHAPTER 1. PhonologyIn the present phonological sketch we will describe the following two main aspects of
Alutor phonology: the static aspect, that is inventories of units (segments and
suprasegmentals), and the dynamic aspect, that is phonological processes. The static
part deals with the sounds of Alutor − phones and phonemes (1.1), as well as the
syllable and rhythmic patterns (1.2). The dynamic part deals with the phonological
processes of Alutor, which are presented in the form of rewriting rules (1.3).
       The approach we use here is similar to that of generative phonology (see also
[Kodzasov, Krivnova 1981]). Two levels of representing Alutor words are
distinguished: the underlying level, that is the level of phonemes (it corresponds to
the morphophonemic level in the Russian traditional phonology) and the surface
level, that is the level of phones, or systematic phonetic level (we omit some minor
details of Alutor pronunciation, irrelevant for the phonetic system). Rewriting rules
apply to the underlying representation of a word, which is a sequence of underlying
representations of the corresponding morphemes. Underlying representations of
Alutor morphemes are given in the Dictionary – see Part III. The application of
rewriting rules results in the surface representation, or the phonetic transcription.
       In the present section the underlying representation of Alutor words and
morphemes is given in braces. Phonetic and practical transcriptions of words are
usually not parenthesized, but in some special cases the phonetic transcription is
given in square brackets. The application of rewriting rules is shown in round
brackets. The inventories of the surface and the underlying representations are
identical, that means we use one and the same chart of symbols for writing phones
and phonemes.","[1, 2]"

"2.1.7.4. Conjunctive
The conjunctive's semantics is related to an event P that is desirable for the speaker,
but is not realized in the actual world. In contrast to the optative, also related to the
domain of desirability, the conjunctive represents the desirability of event P as a
given, without the speaker's aim to participate actively in the event. The degree of
reality of an event can vary, from highly probable, especially if the speaker is the
actor of the event, to irreal— in conditional clauses. Conjunctive verb forms are
translated in different ways.
       Forms in the 1sg actor conjunctive are translated as “should not I do P”, where
P is denoted by the conjunctive verb form:(42) a. ...lygut          ana       ty-@y-Nvu-na                    mimly-N

"1.1.1.3. Long and Short e and o
Vowels e and o always appear as long segments in open stressed or open pre-stressed
syllables (that is in the first or the second syllable of an Alutor word − see 1.2), cf.
@ógyv [E] ‘yesterday’, jepílNyn [E] ‘hoof’, tùrak [O] ‘sink’, lJotítkyn [O] ‘top’.
      Short e and o are found in several roots in closed stressed and closed pre-
stressed syllables before or after q and H, cf. lóqtyk [e] (along with løqtyk) ‘come
back’, HoptílJHu [o] ‘all’, qùnpyN [o] (along with qãnpyN) ‘always’. In post-stressed
syllables, both open and closed, the vowels e and o are usually short, cf. @ísse [e]
‘aunt’, tytôtoratkyn [o] ‘I'll sink’. The latter situation can be treated as standard
vowel shortening in post-stressed position − see 1.3.7 5 . Short e and o are also found
in non-accentuated auxiliary words (see 1.2.2), cf. &gemat [e] ‘maybe’, &Horo [o]
‘then’ (non-accentuated words are marked with “ & ”).
      Long E and O are also found in both open and closed syllables in so-called
“expressive” words, cf. tOk ‘(interjection) let us’ (for more details see 1.3.8.1).
Expressive lengthening of this kind can be found in many languages, but such long
vowels are not considered separate phonemes.
      Thus, in Alutor long and short e and o occur in positions that complement each
other. That is why we find it possible to treat a long phone and its short counterpart as     4
        It is worth mentioning that native speakers of Alutor are not aware of the schwa as a
segment of their pronunciation, whether predictable or not. They think some Alutor words have
only consonants; at the same time, they can easily divide such words into syllables. For instance, a
word which sounds like pyNílly ‘news’ is treated as having three syllables – |p|Nl|l| (the symbol “ |
” indicates syllable boundaries), wítwyt ‘flower’ – as |wt|wt|, HítvyHyt ‘boat’ – as |Ht|v|Ht|. The
same is true for the Koryak language. E.A.Kreynovich [Kreynovich 1958] proposed for Koryak
words the non-vocalised representation (that is without y), but with marked syllable boundaries,
like |wt|wt|. Since the schwa is not part of such representation, the author does not consider it a
phoneme. In our opinion, such approach in neither adequate nor typologically justified, because
there arises a problem of dividing words into syllables – some words have unpredictable syllable
division. Nevertheless, E.A.Kreynovich was the first to pay attention to the crucial importance of
the notion of syllable for Chukchi-Kamchatkan languages. As we will see further, this notion is
absolutely necessary to create well-formed Alutor words.
      5
        From an historical point of view, the Alutor long E and O originated mostly from aj and
aw, or from yj and yw, and original e and o changed into i and u in most positions (they are
preserved only in closed syllables before or after q and H – see above), cf. the following related
words from Alutor and Koryak: Alutor jepílNyn [E] – Koryak jajpylNyn ‘hoof’, Alutor lJotítkyn
[O] – Koryak lJawtytkyn ‘the top of smth.’, Alutor @imNãlyk – Koryak @emNolyk ‘to miss (smb.)’,
but Alutor lóqtyk – Koryak leqtyk ‘to come back’, Alutor qùnpyN – Koryak qonpyN ‘always’
(these correspondences are discussed in detail in [Muravyova 1986a]).",[5]
"        In this way, the antipassive is not obligatorily followed by a decrease in
transitivity; see (10b).
        In Alutor there are verbs that are always accompanied by the ina- marker, for
example, in.emy- ‘scoop, draw’ (etymologically bound with the intransitive verb
emy- ‘go for water’). This verb has three arguments (agent, patient, and instrument),
optionally complemented by benefactive. The interpretation is possible that in
primary diathesis there is no argument that fills the highest position, therefore the
location of any argument in this position is marked with the inversion marker:(11) a. ynnu           in.emy-tky-n             miml-a           eminaN-a

3.1.3.2. Semantics of the antipassive
In a number of cases the use of the antipassive is motivated by the
c o m m u n i c a t i v e s t r u c t u r e of an utterance, namely by the need of the speaker
to focus attention on an argument occupying a non-central position in the verbal
government pattern or, conversely, to remove an argument from a pragmatically
salient position. Thus in the following examples the use of the antipassive is
motivated by the need to remove the patient from the utterance:
                                              116

The infinitive forms sentential complements of phasal verbs (with typical meanings
‘begin’ 94 , ‘continue’, ‘finish’). Phasal verbs inherit the transitivity / intransitivity
properties of subordinate verbs marked as the infinitive. In the context of an
intransitive embedded verb the main verb has an intransitive agreement pattern and
agrees with a noun marked with the nominative:(50) a. ...myty-lJgi=tgilivy-lqiv-la(-myk)                              tanJNy.sity-k!

          ...Well, that's enough. Stop running (after me)... [8:59]
       However, in the context of a transitive embedded verb the main verb gets a
transitive agreement pattern:
     94
       Statistically the overwhelming number of infinitive textual occurences are governed by the
verb ‘begin’.","[77, 78, 79, 80]"

            (Once) a rich man Qisgayat became sick. [29:4]      In example (61) the form pyttuNy-l@y-n ‘the rich’ is derived from the adjective
ny-pyttuN-qin ‘rich’. Such forms can be used both attributively (as appositions) and
non-attributively (as nouns). Being used attributively, they agree in case and number
with the head noun.
      The highest degree of quality can also be expressed by means of the suffix -s@,
identical with the verbal attributivizer expressing intense actions. The suffix is often
accompanied by the prefix am-, cf.:(62) a. y-nanny                Nita.q         mata-ni-nat

      Another way to express a high degree of quality is to add the prefix ynan- (yn-
ynnuxwin ynan-@yssaNi ‘Here is the youngest (daughter), this one’ [32:12]), often
accompanied by the suffix -s@ (cf. ynan-meNy-s@y-n qylik=tytka ‘the biggest male
walrus’ [22:14]).
      In a comparative construction the object of comparison appears in the dative
case, while the adjective is in its usual form, but with the incorporated quantifier
Hopty- ‘most’:(63)        ... gymmy          turyky-N           ny-Hopty=katgu-jgym ...

object for each possible subject of the action.","[86, 87]"
"3.3.2. Taxonomic clauses
Taxonomic clauses indicating the membership of a nominal argument in a class of
objects have two main patterns. T h e f i r s t , most natural pattern is a combination of
two adjacent NPs, one of them being the S-argument, and the other the predicate:(37) a. qutawwyjNy-nin                           qetakalNy-n          HaqaniNvit

2.3.2), namely the overt personal markers controlled by 1st/2nd person S-arguments:(39)      tita-kin-egym        gymmy(N)         gy.nin-egym          Nav.akk-egym.

with the S-argument.

‘be, serve as’ <smb.: N, as smb.: Eq>. This verb is compatible with the values of all
verbal categories in accordance with the semantics of the clause. In the predicate

in (40b) by a substantivized participle, and in (40c) by a noun 126 .","[126, 127, 128]"
"1.2.2. Rhythmic Structure
According to their rhythmic structure, all Alutor words can be divided into two main
classes:
        1) words having a phonetically prominent syllable − such words are called
a c c e n t u a t e d words;
        2) words with no phonetically prominent syllables − such words are called
u n a c c e n t u a t e d words.
        The class of accentuated words is the most numerous. Here we find the majority
of words belonging to the main parts of speech, and also a lot of auxiliary words.
        The prominence of the stressed syllable is characterised by the increase of
pronouncing energy applied mainly to the rhyme of a syllable. This is manifested in a
number of ways. If a syllable is open and the nucleus is a short vowel (but not a
supershort y), the stress is expressed by the vowel lengthening, cf. qylôvul [A]
‘husband’. If a syllable is closed, the stress is expressed by the code strengthening,
that is the syllable-final consonant. The strengthening of a final consonant is clearly
perceptible in case of the |CyC| syllable type (native speakers say that in such
syllables the stress falls on the consonant, not on the vowel), cf. wítwyt [wíttywyt]
‘flower’ 19 . It is worthy of remark that syllables of the |Cy| type cannot bear stress,
because the vowel y cannot be lengthened.",[13]
"1.3. Phonological Processes
Alutor exhibits a great variety of phonological processes22 . Here we find various
segmental changes − a l t e r n a t i o n s , as well as root copying − r e d u p l i c a t i o n s .
Among alternations there are replacements (including assimilations of different types,
lenitions and fortitions, coalescences, etc.), insertions and deletions, and also
metatheses. The most important phonological process in Alutor is that of creating the
right syllable and rhythmic structure: some phonological processes help to create the
right structure, while others take place only after the right structure has been created.
Most Alutor alternations are phonologically conditioned, but there are also many
alternations that are morphologically conditioned (the latter will be described in this
section too).
       Alutor phonological processes are represented here in the form of rewriting
rules. The rules apply to the underlying representation of a word, that is a sequence of
underlying representations of morphemes constituting the word. Underlying
representations of morphemes are given in the Dictionary − see Part III. The result of
application is the surface representation, i.e. the phonetic transcription of a given
word. The rules are listed here in the order they should apply to the underlying
representation (the only exception is mentioned in 1.3.3.2).
       The majority of rules given below describe various segment modifications; they
are numbered with Arabic numerals. There are also the stress assignment rules – they
are numbered with Roman numerals. Besides, there are some additional rules that do
not change the structure of words, but mark syllable boundaries and types of syllables
– they are numbered with capital letters.
       Each rule is given in two variants: as an ordinary utterance and as a formal rule.
The notation we use for formal rules is X ⇒ Y / A_B, which means that a segment
(or a string of segments) X is replaced by a segment (or a string of segments) Y in the
context defined by A_B. The bar “ _ ” marks the position of the segment undergoing
the process. The context A and B may contain: symbols for consonants and vowels –
C and V, their phonological properties (shown by the lowered script), a morpheme
(M) the segment belongs to - a root (R) or an affix (this is marked with “ ∈ ”), some
     22
          Here we follow the logical classification of phonological processes given in [Mel’иuk
1996].",[16]
"1.2. Syllable and Rhythmic structure
1.2.1. Syllable Structure
Alutor imposes strict conditions on syllable structure, and the notion of syllable is
essential for the phonological pattern of the Alutor language.
        If we consider the main classes of sounds − consonants and vowels − the
canonical syllable patterns will be |CV| and |CVC| (the symbol “ | ” indicates a
syllable boundary). These patterns have only one constraint: if the nucleus of a
syllable is a long vowel, the syllable has no coda. Thus, in reality we find the
following syllable patterns: |Cy|, |СVshort|, |CVlong|, |CyC|, |СVshortC| (here V is a non-
schwa vowel), cf. |vi|tô|tyk| ‘work’, |tøl|my|til| ‘eagle’, |@øt|@yn| ‘fur coat’, |@a|lô|@al|
‘summer’, |jØ|ly|jil| ‘tongue’, |wi|rã|wir| ‘(kind of) salmon’, |ja|tít|kyn| ‘(s)he is
coming’.
        The set of syllable patterns given above is valid only if we consider a careful,
distinct pronunciation, which we will call the standard pronunciation. In fluent speech
native speakers may often elide the schwa in a two or three consonant cluster (one of
the consonants is usually a sonorant), so there may appear some consonant clusters,
illicit in the standard pronunciation. Thus, we often find optional words pronounced
of other syllable types, such as |CCV| and |CCVC|, cf. qylôvul ~ qlôvul ‘husband’,
@ínkyjap ~ @ínkjap ‘long ago’ 17 . In the present paper we prefer to deal only with the
standard pronunciation.
        Word boundaries in Alutor always coincide with syllable boundaries, for
instance, @ógyv|#@arNønati (not *@ógy|v#ar|Nønati) ‘It rained yesterday’.
        In reduplications the boundary between the two root morphs also coincides with
the syllable boundary, cf. @ønmy|@in (< {inm=in}) ( not *@in|min) ‘gulp’. The same is
true with incorporations and productive compounds, but only if the second stem
begins with a vowel, cf. mis@ô=@it@yl@yn (< {mis@a=it-l@-n}) ‘the one in a beautiful
fur coat’, sasø=@ilNatgyrNyn (< {sasi=ilN-at-gyrN-n}) ‘watchstrap’. In some
compounds there is no glottal stop before an initial vowel of the second stem, and the
syllable begins with a preceding consonant, cf. tig-ølNyn (< {tig-ilN-N}) ‘ski strap’.",[12]
"3.2.1. Word order in a predicate-argument structure
In verbal clauses the most frequent word order structures are SVO and VSO:(29) a. tita·qa        qutkinJnJaqu-nak          maN.ki·@ana

      The category m o o d is also obligatory. It has four values:
      - i n d i c a t i v e (IND), does not have its own specific markers;
      - o p t a t i v e (OPT), does not have its own specific markers 48 ;
      - p o t e n t i a l (POT), circumfix marker ta-...(-N) 49 , framing the verb stem;
      - c o n j u n c t i v e (CONJ), prefix marker @-/A- 50 .
      Besides these, in Alutor there is also an impersonal form of the i m p e r a t i v e
(see 2.1.3).
      Finally, the finite verb agrees 51 in person and number with its core arguments,
distinguishing three persons (1st/2nd/3rd person) and three numbers — s i n g u l a r
(sg), d u a l (du) and p l u r a l (pl) 52 . Intransitive verbs agree with their sole core
argument (S - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the nominative, and have, aspect and mood
being fixed, 9 person-number forms. The transitive verb agrees simultaneously with
the agentive argument (A - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the ergative as well as with the
patientive argument (P - a r g u m e n t 53 ) marked with the nominative, and has, aspect

         The mood value is coded cumulatively, together with person-number values, see below.
     49
          The suffix component of the circumfix can be covert, for example, in imperfective
potential. The potential marker coincides with desiderative marker (see 2.1.3 below).
      50
         The marker A- is a phonetic variant of the marker @- in specific positions (see 1.3.6).
      51
         In Alutor the person-number markers are combined with the unmarked usage of personal
pronouns in the core argument positions, so it is possible to interpret them as agreement markers.
      52
          As the paradigms show, semantically this tripartite personal opposition has its own
internal structure. The opposition ‘singular — non-singular’ (sg — nsg) consists of six deictic
items. Elementary single entities are defined in terms of speech act participants (1sg = ‘speaker’,
2sg = ‘hearer’) and non-participants of the speech act (3sg = ‘somebody’). Non-singular entities
are totalities of elementary entities: 1nsg = ‘speaker and hearer/somebody’, 2nsg = ‘hearer and
somebody’, 3nsg = ‘somebody and somebody’ (i.e. the countable number opposition of
homogenous entities is present only in the 3rd person). Exactly these entities are ordered in the
Deictic Hierarchy (see Figure 1 below). The arrangement of non-singular entities with respect to
singular entities is semantically motivated. Thus, ‘1nsg’ includes, besides the speaker, the hearer
and/or the 3rd person. Such an entity is lower on the Hierarchy than ‘1sg’. Simultaneously this
entity is higher than ‘2sg’, because it includes the speaker, and this factor is most important for
the Hierarchy. The motivation for ‘2nsg’ is similar.
      Within the scope of the non-singular there is a proper number opposition of dual and plural
(du and pl), because the number of homogenous elementary entities increases, and this opposition
uses iconically specific coding devices (see 2.1.1.2.4). Dual does not have a surface expression (it
is possible to postulate the zero marker), and plural is expressed by a specific morpheme —
pluralizer -la.
      In that way the prototypical number opposition is represented in the subsystem of 1/2nd
person nsg, and partially in 3rd person sg/nsg.

3.1.4.2. Semantics of incorporation
Incorporation is a device that simplifies the syntactic structure of a clause. It
                                                  121
decreases the syntactic rank of constituents that are out of the scope of assertion and,
more generally, beyond the focus of attention 124 . If incorporation affects the
constituent that occupies a prestigious position in a clause, it opens the possibility of
raising the status of another constituent occupying a peripheral position in the initial
structure.
      Along with this, it is possible to confirm the usage of incorporation for the
purpose of overcoming syntactic restrictions over syntactic structure. For example, -
l@- participles form reduced relative clauses whose nominative argument is
coreferential with the head NP. With respect to this restriction it is sometimes
necessary to free the nominative position, incorporating the P-argument of a transitive
verb:(25) y.ninny             unJunJu               qur=etaty-l@-u                    ity-tkyn.

     {LC: Patat used him as a worker, and} his son was a reindeer drover. [16:11]      To illustrate the functions of incorporation, consider the following example:(26) g-akmi.l-lin                  rynny=Hal                 to
      RES-take-RES+3sg.P           horn=axe+NOM+SG           and
      ga-lJHinJnJy=svi-l(in)         ynki      naqam         milJgy=ttu-l@aty-l@y-n.
      RES-neck=cut-RES+3sg.S         here      at.once       fire=blow-ITER-ATR-NOM+SG
              (The man) took a horn axe and instantly cut off the head [=cut the neck] of the one
      (who was) blowing fire. [18:11]
       In (26) there are three incorporation compounds. The expression rynny=Hal
‘horn axe’ is idiomatic, it refers to an artifact. The compound galJHinJnJy=svil(in) ‘cut
the neck’ allows to heighten the status of the possessor, expressed by the
substantivized participle milJgy=ttul@atyl@yn ‘the one who was blowing fire’. Note
that incorporated P-argument of the verb ‘blow’ allows to form this type of participle
referring to the performer of the action.","[120, 121, 122]"
"2.1.1.1. Grammatical categories of polypersonal conjugation
Polypersonal conjugation is specified by the following categories: aspect, mood, and
person-number agreement with the core arguments of intransitive and transitive
verbs. There are two values for a s p e c t : perfective (PF) and imperfective (IPF).
P e r f e c t i v e has an unmarked value, it coincides with the verb's stem,
i m p e r f e c t i v e has a suffix marker -tky /-tkyn /-tkyni (its ending depends on the
type of the following morphemes 47 ).",[40]

1.1.1.2. Phonological Status of Schwa
The phonological status of schwa is one of the most interesting problems of the
Chukchi-Kamchatkan phonology. Some authors (see, for instance, [Zhukovа 1968])
regard this vowel as a purely auxiliary segment and do not include it in the inventory
of phonemes. Actually, the fact that the schwa is predictable in many contexts is
rather obvious. In such cases the surface representation of a word containing y can be
derived from the underlying representation without y (= the “non-vocalized”
representation) by means of simple insertion rules (see 1.3.3.2). For example, if a
word sounds like tyjôtyk ‘I came’, it can be derived from *tjatk. Here the schwas
break up the word-initial and the word-final consonant clusters. Thus, in this word, as
well as in many other words, y is just an epenthetic. This means that the schwa is     1
      Previously, long vowels were found neither in Alutor nor in any other Chukchi-
Kamchatkan language (cf. [Moll 1955; Zhukova 1968] and others).",[3]

       Besides demonstrative adjectives, there are also demonstrative adverbs derived
from the same roots: wutku ‘here’, wutkepyN ‘from here’, Nanyk ‘there’, igynNinak
‘that is why’ and others. In order to express great distance from the speaker and the
hearer the iconic vowel lengthening is used (see 1.3.8.1), for instance, instead of
Nanyk ‘there’ the form NOnyk ‘far over there’ is often used.","[108, 109]"

       No connection is found between syllable boundaries and morpheme boundaries.
At the same time, there is an obvious correlation between morpheme boundaries and
the position of epenthetic schwas: the schwa often plays the role of an
“intermorpheme segment”, cf. ní-mky-qin = n-y-mk-y-qin (< {n-mk-qin})
‘numerous’ (see 1.3.3.2).
       The morphology of Alutor combines morphemes in such a way that an
underlying representation may be ill-formed. It may have illicit sound strings, such as
initial syllables without onsets, illicit consonant clusters, hiatus etc. Illicit strings
usually appear word-initially and word-finally, and also at morpheme boundaries 18 .
In order to obtain well-formed words, we must modify the underlying representation
by means of certain phonological rules, among them initial consonant deletion, glottal
stop epenthesis, schwa epenthesis, and hiatus vowel deletion (see 1.3.2 and 1.3.3).","[12, 13]"

The 2nd person optative semantically coincides with the imperative 63 , because exactly in this
speech situation the speaker perlocutively affects the addressee with the speech act.
      5. The 1nsg value does not differentiate between the conjunctive and the optative: these
moods have the single myn- agreement marker 64 , in contrast to 1sg. In the context of the
conjunctive 1sg uses the t- marker, identical to the one used in the unmarked moods, and such a
merger takes place only for this person. Probably the maximal degree of control on the part of the
speaker over the desirable event is important: inasmuch as the speaker has an S/A-role in the
event, the probability of its accomplishment is estimated by the speaker to be very close to real
event.
      6. A unique 1sg marker is present in the optative (m-). In this mood the speaker is
simultaneously the sender as well as the recipient of the prescription. It should be taken into
account that this mood does not have its own marker and differs from the indicative only by
means of agreement markers, i.e. the speech acts with different S/A-arguments are cognitively
different. The following types of desires are distinguished: a desire addressed to the speaker
himself (m-), addressed to the speaker and other persons (myn-), addressed to the hearer and,
optionally, to other persons (n-) (in the latter case the addressee of desire being virtual rather than
actual).","[47, 48]"

         In unaccentuated words the vowel length contrast is hardly detectable. It should
be noted that unaccentuated words can be clearly distinguished only if the syllable
supposed to bear stress is an open one, cf. jônut [A] ‘today’ vs. &janut [a] ‘earlier’
(the symbol “ & ” indicates the absence of stress in a word), @inøri [I] ‘blanket’ vs.
&siriri [i] ‘sandpiper’. If such syllable is a closed one, it is more difficult to reveal the
absence of stress.
         The position of stress in Alutor can be described in terms of syllable weight,
thus it is a quantity sensitive system. Two types of syllables are distinguished here:
l i g h t (mono-moraic) syllables and h e a v y (bi-moraic) syllables. Syllables of the
|Сy| type are light syllables, while the other types are all heavy.
         The position of stress in accentuated words is determined by the following three
phonological constraints:
         1) only a heavy syllable can bear stress; light syllables are always unstressed;
         2) only the first or the second syllable can bear stress (but the second syllable is
preferable);
         3) a word-final syllable cannot bear stress.
         These constraints help us to describe all the possible rhythmic patterns. First of
all, a monosyllabic cannot bear stress, for its only syllable is the final one (but there
exist some unaccentuated monosyllablic auxiliary words − see below). In case of a
disyllabic accentuated word, the first syllable is stressed (it always appears to be a
heavy one), for instance, @ôkyk ‘son’, kíttil ‘forehead’, wôla ‘knife’ 20 . Polysyllabics
may have stress either on the first or the second syllable, cf. tølpyqal ‘shoulder’,
tírgytyr ‘meat’, nØgyqin ‘cool’, vitôtyk ‘work’, NyrôlNyn ‘knee’, vagílNyn ‘nail, claw’.
For details see the stress assignment rules (1.3.4.).
         The class of unaccentuated words is represented by the following groups and
subgroups:
         1) auxiliary words of different types, such as conjunctions, particles,
introductory words, and also some adverbs, cf. &qinaq ‘in order to’, &Horo ‘then’,
&matka ‘whether’, &kytvyl ‘not (prohibition)’, &gemat ‘maybe’, &agi ‘very’, &lygan
‘even’, &wasaq ‘sometimes’, &jaqi ‘later’;
         2) some personal pronoun forms, such as:
         a) the dative form with a light second syllable, cf. &gymykyN ‘to me’, &gynykyN
‘to you (sg)’, &@ynykyN ‘to him’, &murykyN ‘to us’, &turykyN ‘to you (pl)’, &@ytykyN     20
         Actually, when morphemes are combined into a word, at intermediate stages there may
appear a monosyllabic word with the only stressed syllable or a disyllabic word with the second
stressed syllable, but such intermediate representations are then extended by means of some
special rules (see 1.3.4.3), cf. Nôjjy (< Nôj < {Naj-∅}) ‘mountain’, Nyvã-jjy (< Nyvã-j < {Nvu-j})
‘(s)he/it began’, gyvô-kki (< gyvô-k < {gva-k}) ‘to stick’.","[13, 14]"
"1.3.4.3. Syllable Addition
It appears that the rhythmic structure of the language does not permit stress to fall on
the last syllable of a word, but strings with the last stressed syllable may appear at
intermediate stages of derivation (see rules I and II). In order to improve the rhythmic
structure a supplementary syllable is added.
      The syllable addition rules run as follows:
      if the stress falls on the last (closed) syllable of a word, a supplementary
syllable of the |CV| type is added by means of geminating the last consonant and     35
         In Alutor there are neither stressed disyllabics with the second light syllable nor stressed
disyllabics with the first light and the second open syllable.
      36
         Otherwise, i.e. if the first syllable is light, the word does not acquire any stress.",[25]
"3.0. Basic notions
In this study of Alutor syntax we do not use such t r a d i t i o n a l syntactic notions as
subject and object since, in our opinion, their common usage is not congruent with
the internal structure of Alutor and would merely lead to misunderstanding. In this
case it is more advisable to use more neutral notions based on a framework of core
arguments constituting the base of clause syntactic structure (for the grounds of the
opposition “core vs. peripheral arguments” see [Kibrik 1998]).
        There is a restricted number of core arguments in a clause. If there is only one
core argument in a clause 116 , the clause (as well as its predicate) is i n t r a n s i t i v e .
This argument is called the S - a r g u m e n t (Sole) irrespective of its semantic role. If
there are two core arguments in a clause, the clause (as well as its predicate) is
t r a n s i t i v e . A transitive clause has an agent-like A - a r g u m e n t (Agentive) and a
patient-like P- a r g u m e n t (Patientive).
        In our case, this terminology is preferable because it does not ascribe a
particular syntactic pattern to Alutor clause structure, keeping this fundamental
question open for further investigation, as there is not yet enough data to resolve this
problem.",[110]
"1.1.2.2. Obstruents
The obstruents are subdivided into two classes: plosives and fricatives. In Alutor all
the plosives are voiceless, and all the fricatives are voiced. The Alutor fricatives have
a rather broad passageway, so they are similar to sonorants. Fricatives are represented
by only two segments − v and g. It is remarkable that while Alutor fricative obstruents
                                                   8
are not numerous, there is great variety to the sonorants. 9
       Alutor obstruents occur at all the places of articulation, except for the absence
of palatals.
       Labials are represented by the two consonants − p and v.
       Dentalveolars (both obstruents and sonorants) are represented by the dentals t,
n, l and the alveolar r. The dentals contrast in secondary articulation − palatalization;
they may be either non-palatalized or palatalized. The non-palatalized dental t does
not have a voiced fricative correlate 10 . The exact palatalized correlate of t would be tJ,
but this is not the sound we usually find in Alutor (actually, the sound tJ does occur,
but only in some Alutor words, cf. matka ~ matJka ‘interrogative particle’). The
sound we consider the palatalized correlate of t is represented mainly by two variants,
both close to the palatalized tJ, but not identical with it: the affricate tsJ and the
fricative sJ, the latter similar to a palatal fricative. The affricate occurs mainly in the
speech of the old generation, while the fricative is more widely used, it occurs in the
speech of young and middle-aged people. In papers on Alutor the fricative sound is
usually registered as s; in the present paper we also use s to write this sound in the
practical transcription. It is remarkable that the morphological alternation t/tsJ occurs
approximately in the same contexts as the alternations 1/1J, n/nJ (see 1.3.10). On
these grounds we refer to tsJ as the palatalized correlate of t. The phoneme tsJ has no
voiced counterpart 11 .
       Velars are represented by the plosive k and the fricative g. The fricative is
rather close to the sonorants, it often sounds very much like the labial velar w 12 . It is
remarkable that g changes into w syllable-finally (see 1.3.5).
       Uvulars are represented by the plosive q, which is slightly pharyngealized. In     9
         It is possible that the Alutor system is changing from a system with two classes of
obstruents − plosives and fricatives, to a system with one class of plosives. That is just how the
Koryak consonants are often described (see [Trubetskoy 1958, Zhukova 1972]): all non-plosives
are treated as sonorants. But there are some typological facts that should be taken into
consideration: first, two labial non-nasal sounds are not common in the class of sonorants; second,
if g were a sonorant, we would have its vocalic correlate – a high back non-rounded vowel, but
there is no such vowel in the Alutor system. That is why we prefer to describe the Alutor system
as contrasting between plosives and fricatives. Cf. also the reconstruction proposed in [Mudrak
2000].
      10
          The corresponding phoneme is reconstructed for the Chukchi-Koryak protolanguage
[Muravyova 1986a]: in Alutor it coincided with t, in Koryak − with j/č, in Chukchi − with r, cf.
Alutor tiNak − Koryak jiNek − Chukchi riNek ‘fly’.
      11
          Even if there had been such a sound in the proto-Alutor language, it is likely to have
coincided with the palatal j.
      12
         Such a sound exists, for example, in the Polish language.","[8, 9]"
"2.3.1.2. Case functions
Below we enumerate the main functions of the Alutor cases.
      The n o m i n a t i v e is used mostly to express the syntactic function of an S/P-
actant, that is the Absolutive hyperrole, according to the ergative actant marking
strategy (see 3.0). The nominative (not a bare stem) is also used to express named
objects. Besides this, the nominative is used in the vocative position, with final vowel
lengthening (we treat this process as expressive vowel lengthening − see 1.3.8.1), for
instance, in the vocative we may use miti along with mitE 107 ‘Oh, Miti!’ (Miti is a
mythological woman’s name).
      The e r g a t i v e is used to express the following functions: a) the A-actant of a
verb, that is the actant with an Agentive hyperrole, b) the instrument of an action, c)
the lowered actant of a verb in the antipassive construction (see 3.1.3.1). Beside the
Agent, the Agentive hyperrole in Alutor also includes the Experiencer. Thus, the
Agentive hyperrole is typical for verbs such as ‘take’, ‘cut’ (the Agent) / ‘see’, ‘wish’
(the Experiencer):(69) a. qutkinJnJaqu-nak            g-akmi.l-lin               utty-@ut ...
           Qutkinnaqu-ERG+SG        RES-take-RES+3sg.P         stick-NOM+SG
     105
         These variants appear because the inflection -jpyN historically comes from the root {jp},
and undergoes changes given in rule (11) (see 1.3.6) either as a root or a suffix.
     106
         Here and in some other cases the vowel y is epenthetic.
     107
         We call this form the “expressive” vocative.",[97]

"3.6. Clausal coordination
Clausal coordination is not accompanied by any strict rules of coreferential NP
marking. Practically all strategies (repetition of full nominations, replacement of full
nomination by a pronoun or its deletion) are realized. Let us consider these strategies.
     1) In both clauses full NPs are present without reduction:(59)     ...ga-meNy-teNal-lin                           unJunJu              to

         ...the son prepared a lot of fish (for winter) and on purpose [the son], well, how to say,
         said to (his) mother... [9:2]
       2) Pronominalization of one of the NPs:(60)     qutkinJnJaqu-nak            ly@u-ni-nat               unJunJu-t            to

In (61a) the second NP is deleted (anaphoric reduction), while in (61b) the first one is
deleted (cataphoric reduction).
      In case of pronominalization or deletion a specific situation can arise if the
clause holding the controlling NP is transitive: what argument of the clause controls
pronominalization/deletion of the reduced NP in the other clause? Statistically the A-
argument prevails, however it is far from being an obligatory rule:(62) a. pila-lqiv-ni-n,                      ten         viH-i            ynN.in.

         And at once the stranger killed the younger brother with the spear, and he {the brother}
         there and then died. [20:44]     In (62a) pronominalization, and in (62b) deletion is used. In both cases the P-
argument of the first clause is the controller of these processes.                                  Comment: process or
                                                                                                    processes ?
     Even the possessor can control reduction:

3.7. Reflexivization
In Alutor argument reflexivization (affecting the argument position) is expressed with
the help of the reflexive pronoun uvik ‘oneself’ (lit. ‘body’), and possessive
reflexivization (affecting the possessive position) uses the pronoun sininkin/sinin
‘one's own’ (the second variant is used in case of incorporation).
      The question of control of reflexivization is of special interest. According to the
field report by F.A.Antsiferov (1978), the A/S-argument is the controller of
reflexivization:(65) a. vasq.in=meNy=kuka-ta                uvik                   g-epy-lin

2.2.2. Relative adjectives
R e l a t i v e adjectives (= the adjectival form of a noun), express a general modifying
meaning. They are usually derived from nouns, and sometimes from adverbs and
verbs. They are marked with the adjectivizer -kin(a) (further shortened to kin). Being
used attributively, a relative adjective agrees in person and number with its S-actant.
Thus, in the 3rd person it is marked with kin/-kina-t/-kina(-w(wwi)) ‘3sg/du/pl’,
and in the 1st or 2nd person the standard person-number markers are used, following
the adjectivizer -kin(a), for instance, -kin-egym 100 ‘1sg’, see Table 13.","[87, 88]"

         Usually in Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages the mood under consideration is called
imperative, see [Zhukova 1968] (Alutor), [Zhukova 1972] (Koryak), [Volodin 1992] (Kerek),
[Skorik 1977] (Chukchi). However the semantics of 1st and 3rd persons’ S/A-arguments does not
have a perlocutive component of inducement to the action (see the separate analysis of the
meanings of these forms in [Muravyova 1990a]). It should be mentioned that Alutor rarely uses
the imperative proper, see 2.1.3.

the agreement of the predicate.
      The predicative is also used as an apposition for another noun or pronoun (the
pronoun itself may be absent).(81)       yjOwyt            ina-n.tymNi.v-la-tyk               Nan-ynnul-egym ...

2.3.3. Adjectival forms
The adjectival form of a noun is actually the result of a derivational process, when a
noun becomes an adjective. We distinguish between relative (REL), possessive
(POSS), habitive (HABIT) and caritive (CARIT) adjectives, see 2.2.2. From a
syntactic point of view an adjectival is used in the role of the genitive, sometimes the
ablative, which occur in other languages with case systems.","[102, 103]"

1.3.10. Irregular Distant Dental Palatalisations
Alutor alternations which we call distant palatalizations are rather peculiar from a
typological point of view. The alternation itself looks like this: in some morphemes
(mostly roots) a dental non-palatalized consonant changes into its palatalized
correlate in the context defined by another morpheme of the same word (mostly an
affix), cf. vilJãpilJ (< {vilu-pilJ}) ‘little ear’. Since some such morphemes (but not all
of them) contain a palatalized consonant and the changing segment becomes a
palatalized one, we treat this process as distant palatalization, and refer to the
corresponding morphemes as “palatalizing” ones 43 .
       The process takes place in roughly the following environment:
       if there is a palatalizing morpheme in a word, a non-palatalized dental t, n, or l
changes into its palatalized counterpart s (seldom tJ), nJ, or lJ (in some cases s)
respectively, i.e.
(24) a. t ⇒ s (seldom tJ ) / ∃Mpalatalizing
       b. n ⇒ nJ / ∃Mpalatalizing
       c. l ⇒ lJ (in some cases s) / ∃Mpalatalizing.
       Examples: gasvôs@atylqivlin (< {ga-(t)va-s@at-lqiv-lin(a)}) ‘(s)he was
sitting’, anJãs@atyk (< {anu-s@at-k}) ‘spend spring’, alJôs@atyk (< {ala-s@at-k})
‘spend summer’, nJyvøssykuk 44 (< {nvil-tku-k}) ‘stop (repeatedly)’, lJóvytkuk (<
{levy-tku-k}) ‘walk’, mysôtkuk (< {mla-tku-k}) ‘break’.
       But in reality the distribution of the alternants and the context they appear in
turn out to be more complicated than it is shown in the above-mentioned rule. First,
palatalizing morphemes may not contain a palatalized consonant 45 , cf. HønJnJykvyn (<
{Hinn-kv-n}) ‘scarf’ ({kv} is a palatalizing suffix). Second, palatalizing affixes may
cause palatalization in one root and not affect another root, cf. lJóvytkuk (< {levy-tku-
k}) ‘walk’, but @ôngytytkuk (< {angyt-tku-k}) ‘celebrate’ ({tku} is a palatalizing
suffix). Third, it is difficult to find a strict distribution between the palatalized
consonants lJ and s (actually, we think that the alternation l/s is more ancient, while
l/lJ is an innovation). Fourth, there exist not only palatalizing affixes, but also
palatalizing roots, for palatalization appears in some affixes, cf. nJãmqin (< {n-um-
qin(a)}) ‘warm’ ({um} should be treated as palatalizing root), but nurôqin ‘distant’.
And finally, there are duplicate affixes with the alternation l/s, which slightly differ     43
        A.N.Zhukova [Zhukova 1972] refers to similar alternations in the Koryak language as
“consonant harmony”.
     44
        When the dental of a root is palatalized, the dental of an affix is usually palatalized too.
     45
        At the same time, if an affix has a palatalized consonant, it is not necessarily a palatalizing
one.","[31, 32]"

      Adjectives marked with n-...-qin can be used both attributively and
predicatively (see 3.3), but the first use is more frequent.
      Like other attributes without a head noun, adjectives may be substantivized. In
such situations a person-number form is used as a nominative case form.(58) ... naqam                  ga-n.pasus.av-laN unJunJu-pilJ-nJaqu,

       Substantivized adjectives used in oblique cases (that is those different from the
nominative) are not found in Alutor.
       Another adjective form is derived from a qualitative stem by means of a-...-ka.
It is called the p r e d i c a t i v e form. Its only function is to indicate a predicate 97 :(59) a. a-mylru-ka                  ymqa-nin                     unJunJu

      97
         Thus, there are two adjective forms used predicatively: the form marked with n-...-qin
and the form marked with a-...-ka. Their distribution is not clear, but it is possible that they
express the difference between the permanent and temporary state respectively (so they are
similar to Russian full and short adjectives).","[84, 85]"

      COMMENTS on Table 5
      1. S/A-markers consistently merge the indicative and the potential as bjective moods.
The use of these moods presupposes the existence of corresponding events. The indicative mood
characterizes the event as existing in a real world, and the potential mood, as existing in a virtual
world. The conjunctive and the optative are unified by the idea of esirable modality: they
indicate the events of the world of a speaker's desires (see the semantics of mood in 2.1.7.1 —
2.1.7.4).
      2. In unmarked bjective moods (IND and POT) only locutors have the prefixal
agreement markers, and these markers can be considered pure. In esirable moods the mood
and deictic values are combined 62 , therefore non-locutors also have prefix markers.
      3. 2nd and 3rd person conjunctives (CONJ) have the single marker n-, indicating a S/A-
participant, whom the speaker does not control. The choice of the same marker for 3rd person
optative (OPT) is not random.
      4. 2nd person optative has a specific marker q-, which is differentiated from the 3rd person.",[47]

     — the speaker has resources to accomplish event P,
     — the speaker does not have a strong intention to use his resources for the
accomplishment of event P.","[76, 77]"
