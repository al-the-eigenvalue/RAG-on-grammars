"(117) Yurok negative words
      (a) the ordinary negative preverb neemee, or (especially in Classical Yurok) its
          variants mee, ’eemee, and keemee “will not”
      (b) the emphatic negative particle mos (and a rare longer variant mosee’)Note that neemee is a preverb that occurs before the verb together with other preverbs,
while mos is a discourse particle that occurs, like to’, at the beginning of a sentence. In
texts and spontaneous language use by ﬂuent speakers, in the expression of negation
neemee is more common; mos occurs in an important but restricted set of situations.
80      /     Using other preverbs
8.2.1 Ordinary and emphatic negation
The emphatic negative particle mos is used in four main situations.
   First, mos is the usual negative word used to express meanings such as “nobody”,
“nothing”, “not . . . anybody”, and “not anything”. As shown in (118), examples mostly
have mos kol’.
(118)   Examples of mos kol’
        (a) Mos kol’ soosek’.
            “I’m not thinking about anything.”                               FS 1951 (YL)
        (b) Mos kol’ kee nee nosep’.
            “Nobody could marry there.”                                      BF 1951 (YL)
        (c) q: Neemee hes newoom’ kuech kue ’ne-ka’ar?
            a: Paa, tos, mos k’ee we’yk’oh ’u-wook kol’ ’o newook’.
            “Haven’t you seen my pet, grandmother?”
            “No, child, I have not seen anything here this morning.”         FS 1951 (YL)
        (d) Mos kwelekw wee’eeet kol’ mehl son’.
            “That does not matter to me.”                                    FS 1951 (YL)    Second, mos is the usual negative word used with the particle cheetaa “at all”. Exam-
ples of mos cheetaa “not at all” are shown in (119).
(119)   Examples of mos cheetaa “not at all’
        (a) Mos cheetaa wo pahchew.
            “It was not moving at all.”                                      FS 1951 (YL)
        (b) Mos cheetaa kue ’wo-’o’hl.
            “His house was no more.”                                         FS 1951 (YL)
        (c) Kwesee mos cheetaa wo neee’nowee’.
            “And no notice at all was taken of him.”                         FS 1951 (YL)Sometimes the ﬁrst two patterns are combined, with mos cheetaa kol’, as in (120).
(120)   Examples of mos cheetaa kol’
        (a) Mos cheetaa kol’ ’osreer.
            “There isn’t a sound anywhere.”                                   FS 1980 (PP)
        (b) Mos cheetaa kol’ sook kee nee ’oyhl.
            “Nothing at all lay on it.”                                      FS 1951 (YL)
        (c) Mos cheetaa koleen chweenkep’.
            “Neither (of them) spoke at all.”                                FS 1951 (YL)    A third context for mos is when the intended meaning has a generalizing sense like
“could not”, “would not”, “shall not”, or “never”, as in (121).
(121)   Generalizing mos
        (a) Mos weet kee skuyen’ kee k’e-’wegahpemew.
            “It would not be good for you to get married.”                   BF 1951 (YL)
        (b) Mos wey ’ue-kertkerk’.
            “He was never done ﬁshing for trout.”                            FS 1951 (YL)
                                                        Using other preverbs        /      81
   Finally, in (122), examples are given of a fourth context for mos. For instance, the
emphasis in (122a) is clear from the emphatic pronoun kelee’: “this is absolutely not
your ﬁshing place!” The example in (122b) implies the meaning “any”. In general, when
the intended negative expresses or implies meanings such as “not at all” or “not any”,
then the emphatic negative particle mos is used.
(122) Emphatic mos
      (a) Mos kelee’ k’-ekwol.
          “It is not your ﬁshing place.”                                          FS 1951 (YL)
      (b) Mos kee nahcheechek’ .
          “I won’t give you any.”                                               FS 1951 (RHR)    By contrast, the ordinary negative preverb neemee is used in other situations. It is
the default negative marker, and illustrated in (123).
(123) Examples of neemee
      (a) Neemee skuy’ soneenepek’.
          “I don’t feel well.”                                         FS 1980 (PP)
      (b) Neemee nuemee rook’ws ’o wee’eeet.
          “It’s not very windy here.”                                  FS 1980 (PP)
      (c) Kue pa’aahl ’we-tmenomen neemee nepue’.
          “The half of the salmon facing the water was not eaten.”     FS 1951 (YL)
      (d) Muehlcho’ neemee soo komchuemehl.
          “Perhaps they do not know.”                                  FS 1951 (YL)
      (e) Neemee hegohkuemehl stowstek’ ’ue-’weskwen neemee mehl hego’omah.
          “They did not pick ﬁr branches and did not make ﬁre with them.”
                                                                                  FS 1951 (YL)   The difference between mos and neemee comes out sometimes in the difference be-
tween mos skuy’ and neemee skuy’. Mos skuy’ means “not at all well” — implying “quite
badly”; examples are in (124).
(124) Examples of mos skuy’
      (a) Mos skuy’ kee k’e-teloyewek’.
          “It’s not (at all) good for you to lie.”                                FS 1980 (PP)
      (b) Mos nuemee skuy’ soo chwegeen kue wenchokws.
          “I really don’t like to talk to that woman.”                            JJ 2007 (LC)
      (c) Mos skuy’ soo chkeyek’ nahschueh.
          “I didn’t sleep well last night.”                                       JJ 2007 (LC)By contrast, as in (125), neemee skuy’ just means “not well”.
(125) Examples of neemee skuy’
      (a) Neemee skuy’ soo newee’.
          “It doesn’t look good.”                                              GT 2003 (YLCB)
      (b) Neemee skuy’ soneenepek’.
          “I don’t feel well.”                                                    FS 1980 (PP)In (125a), for example, it is more polite to say something doesn’t look good than to say
that it looks bad (“not at all good”). Or compare “slept badly” in (124c) vs. “don’t feel
well” in (125b).

 8.2.2 Negation and time reference
 8.2.2.1       Negation and past time
 A special past-time preverb wo is used in negative contexts. This is the most common
 way of expressing past time negation. The examples in (126) illustrate wo in sentences
 negated with neemee.
 (126)     Examples of neemee wo
           (a) Kwesee’ neemee nuemee wo chpaa nohl helomey’.
               “Coyote did not dance for a very long time.”                    MM 1927 (YT)
           (b) Neemee wo hlee’.
               “It was not accepted.”                                            BF 1951 (YL)
           (c) Neemee wo weykee’.
               “It was not ﬁnished.”                                                 YL 1951
           (d) Neemee heenoy wo hoole’moh.
               “We did not follow you.”                                              YL 1951
           (e) Neemee wo nahchelek’ kee ’ne-hlkyorkwek’.
               “I wasn’t allowed to watch.”                                      FS 1980 (PP)
           (f) Neemee wo skeweenepek’.
               “I didn’t eat enough.”                                            FS 1980 (PP)     In (126), all that is expressed is that something did not happen. By contrast, in (127),
 wo occurs in sentences negated with mos. In these examples, either mos cheetaa suggests
 the emphatic reading “none at all”, or a verb like ko’moyok’ suggests an interpretation like
 “they could not hear (anything)”.
 (127)     Examples of mos wo
           (a) Kwesee mos cheetaa wo neee’nowee’ kue wee ’o key.
               “No notice whatever was taken of him where he sat.”               FS 1951 (YL)
           (b) Mos cheetaa wo pahchew.
               “It did not move at all.”                                         FS 1951 (YL)
           (c) Mos wo ko’moyohl.
               “They did not hear.”                                                  YL 1951
 8.2.2.2       Negation and future time
 To express future negation, two patterns are common; the modal future preverb kee is
 used with mos or neemee.¹ Typically, as in (128), neemee kee means “will not (won’t)”.
 (128)     Examples of neemee kee “will not”
           (a) Neemee kee kooych.
               “I will not buy it.”                                                  YL 1951
           (b) Neemee kee skuy’ soo hoole’mow’.
               “You will not get on well.”                                       FS 1951 (YL) As shown in (129), mos kee means “cannot (can’t)”.","[110, 111, 112, 113]"
"(116) Examples of cho’ expressing temporal relation

English negative sentences usually have not or -n’t. Yurok negative sentences are usually
formed with the words in (117).",[110]
"9.3.1.2       Questions expecting a negative answer
Some questions presuppose that a negative answer is likely. An English example is Don’t
you see the hawk?, to which a likely answer is No, I don’t see it. In Yurok, much as in
English, such questions are formed with negatives. Examples are in (163).
(163)     Questions expecting a negative answer
          (a) Neemee hes newoom’ kuech kue ’ne-ka’ar?
              “Haven’t you seen my pet, grandmother?”                            FS 1951 (YL)
          (b) Kuech, nee mok’w hes ’oyhl kee nepek’?
              “Grandmother, isn’t there anything lying here for me to eat?”      FS 1951 (YL)

              “Aren’t you ashamed?”                                                  YL 1951In (163c), the addressee may or may not actually be ashamed. In asking this question,
the speaker assumes that the addressee should have been ashamed but isn’t.

9.3.2 Content questions
Unlike yes–no questions, content questions seek a more open-ended answer to ques-
tions like “who?”, “when?”, “where?”, etc. They can be classiﬁed according to the type of
information they seek, and also according to their form. In Yurok, content questions are
formed using one of the question words tee’now, tee’neeshoo, and kues. Among these,
kues is the most ﬂexible.","[125, 126]"

  9.3       Questions
  Questions are of the following two types:
• In a yes–no question, there are only a couple of natural answers. For example, the
  likely answers to the English question Will you help me? are either Yes or No (or some
  expansion or equivalent).
• In a content question, the range of likely answers is broader. For example, given the
  English question Who will help me?, there are numerous possible answers depending
  on the circumstances: Alice, Bert, Charlie, Donna, etc.
  In many languages, yes–no questions and content questions are formed in different
  ways. In English, for example, content questions use a word such as where?, what?,
  why?, etc., while yes–no questions are formed by changing word order: Can you hear
  me? Yurok too has two different methods for forming the two types of questions.",[123]

Three other common preverbs are worth mentioning here. Two of them, keetkwo and
noo, have time-related meanings; the other, neenee, has a basic spatial meaning.
                                                          Using other preverbs       /       87
8.4.1 Using keetkwo and noo
The preverb keetkwo can be translated “still”, or in combination with a negative “(not)
yet”; examples are in (144).
(144) Examples of keetkwo
      (a) Keetkwo nee cheeweyek’.
          “I’m still hungry.”                                                      JVP 2001 (JB)

something)”. In combination with a negative, it can be translated as “stop (doing some-
thing)”; examples are in (145).
(145) Examples of noo
      (a) Tue noo laay’.
          “He kept going along.”                                                 DW 1907 (ALK)

8.4.2 Using neenee
The preverb neenee has two main uses. First, it is used for actions that move around, or
events that simultaneously take place, in a variety of places; “about” or “around” is often a
good translation. Examples with verbs that are consistent with motion appear in (146).
(146) Examples of neenee “(going) around”
      (a) Wee’ neenee kepoyuerek’.
          “I swim about at random.”                                               MM 1927 (ES)
      (b) Kolo wee’ neenee hak’ws.
          “She was kind of laughing around there.”                                 FS 1951 (YL)With verbs that are inconsistent with motion, as in (147), the meaning of neenee is that
multiple subjects or multiple objects are located in a variety of places.
(147) Examples of neenee “(multiple subjects or objects being) around”
      (a) Wee’ neenee rek’eeen ’ue-kahchuuem’.
          “They’re sitting around sewing.”                               FS 1980 (PP)
      (b) To’ cho’ neenee neee’nowom’.
          “You should look around.”                                    DW 1906 (ALK)   Second, neenee expresses comparison and can be translated “more”, as in (148).
(148) Comparative neenee
      (a) Cho’ neenee plerrsem’.
          “Talk louder.”                                                           FS 1951 (YL)
      (b) Nek neenee chey ’o kel’.
          “I am younger than you.”                                                       YL 1951Note that even though the best translation may involve an English adjective (louder,
younger), Yurok neenee is a preverb.
Chapter 9Sentence patterns9.1 Basic word order
Yurok word order is ﬂexible. It is often possible to arrange the words in the same sen-
tence in two or more different ways, all of them quite acceptable. The order that speakers
choose may depend more on emphasis and the nature of their conversation or story than
on purely syntactic rules. But several clear patterns can be noted here.","[117, 118, 119, 120]"
"¹ Pronouns (like nek) are almost always preverbal.
² Note also that kue negeneech is explicitly marked as contrastive via the particle tue’, which can be translated
  “but” and highlights a contrasting noun.

10.1.4        Possession sentences
Yurok lacks a verb with the precise meaning of English have. (Verbs like ’ekonemek’ “hold”
and megetohlkwook’ “take care of” have more speciﬁc meanings.) Instead, to express the
meaning of English sentences like I have a brother or You have a pretty dress, Yurok
uses a form of the verb ’ook’ “I am”. This may seem counterintuitive to English-speaking
students, and diﬃcult to master, but it is one of the most common Yurok constructions.
    Schematically, where X stands for some noun, the construction is this: ’ok’w ’ne-X “I
have an X”. But the verb form ’ok’w does not actually mean “have”; it is a third-person
singular form of ’ook’ “I am”, and it means literally “there is”. What the schematic sentence
’ok’w ’ne-X means literally is “there is my X” or “my X exists”. This is how Yurok (like
many languages) expresses the meaning “have”. Some examples are given in (186).(186)   (a) ’Ok’w ’ner-erkerh.
            “I have a ﬁshing rock.”
            (lit. “My ﬁshing rock exists.”)                                      FS 1980 (PP)

“good” in (186b) appear after ’ok’w; but nouns and pronouns that emphasize or iden-
tify the possessor, including kel’ “you” in (186b) and pegoy “yellowhammer” in (186c),
typically appear before ’ok’w.
    To negate sentences like those in (186), a similar construction is used with neemok’w

 “have little of”. The verbs used are teno’ “there’s a lot of it” and chkeno’ “there’s little of it”;

  9.3.1 Yes–no questions
  Yes–no questions are formed using the question particle hes, positioned either at the
  end of the sentence (this is less common) or (more often) after the ﬁrst word or phrase
  of the sentence. The examples below are divided into two groups: neutral questions,
  whose answer might be “yes” or “no” (§9.3.1.1), and questions whose expected answer
  is “no” (§9.3.1.2).",[123]
"7.1 Background
There are several important differences between the Yurok and English systems of time
reference. One concerns basic tense categories. In English, the basic categories are
past vs. present vs. future: “I saw” vs. “I see” vs. “I will see”. Many languages have an
English-style three-way set, but many other languages — including Yurok — have differ-
ent systems. It is possible to distinguish past-time and future-time preverbs in Yurok,
but the basic system is more nuanced.
    A second important difference has to do with present vs. past time. In English,
whenever you use a verb you must choose between a present-time form (I see) or a
past-time form (I saw), among other verb forms. A distinction between present and
past is obligatory in English grammar. But in Yurok, depending on context, verbs may
express either present or past time; for example, newook’ can mean either “I see” or “I
(recently) saw”. The context will usually make the intended meaning clear.
    A third important difference concerns aspect. Linguists use this term to describe
such concepts as starting and completing an action, as well as the viewpoint that a
speaker chooses on an action being described (for example, depicting it as ongoing or
unitary). You do not need to know this terminology, but the concepts sometimes play a
key role in Yurok preverb choice.
    Table 7.1 on page 65 lists the eight Yurok categories of time reference described
in this chapter, with the frequency of each preverb. By far the most frequent is keech;
second is kee. Many preverbs of time are omitted from Table 7.1 and are not discussed
here. They would be included in a complete study of Yurok grammar, though some are
poorly documented, making it hard to understand all their nuances.

Figure 7.1: A. L. Kroeber in the early 1900s. Beginning in 1901, Kroeber worked with many Yurok elders
and cultural leaders on linguistic and cultural documentation. He and his colleagues recorded over a dozen
hours of Yurok narratives and songs using early recording technology, beginning in 1902; he also transcribed
dozens of other narratives and much information about vocabulary and grammar. In the 1930s and 1940s he
worked extensively with Robert Spott; they coauthored Yurok narratives in 1942.

of examples of each preverb in a corpus of over 6,000 sentences (as of July 2014)
     It is not essential to learn the terms in Table 7.1; the key point is how the preverbs
are used. This is described in §§7.2–7.4; combinations of keech with other preverbs are
described in §7.5.2. The categories of time reference in Table 7.1 also play a role in Yurok
negation and directed motion, topics which will be discussed in §§8.2–8.3.
     The ﬁrst column in Table 7.1 identiﬁes the reference time: past, present, or future.
For example, ’ochkaa is said to have present reference; it is present-referring. This term
indicates the kind of adverb that can be used together with each category. Past-referring
categories can be used with adverbs like chmeyaan “yesterday” or heekon “formerly”;
present-referring categories can be used with adverbs like we’yk’oh “now, today”; and
the future-referring preverb kee can be used with adverbs like ’owook “tomorrow”. This
is illustrated explicitly in (71–74).
     The examples in (71) show that ho and ma have past reference. The adverbs heekon
“long ago” and kohchee “once (one time)” explicitly anchor the reference to a past time.

“right now, today” anchors the time reference.

 perception (ko’moyom’ “he heard”, newook’ “I saw”). The situation described by keet must
 therefore be present at the time of perception.
     Finally, the examples in (74) shows that kee has future reference.

 Three past-referring categories are described in this section: the general past; and the
 situational and punctual past, which are expressed through preverbs. These terms
 are explained in (75).¹
 (75)      (a) The term general past applies to verbs with no time-reference preverbs,
               which can refer generally to the present or the past. For example, ko’moyok’
               can mean “I heard it”; you might ask ko’moyom’ hes? “did you hear it?”
           (b) The situational past preverb ho indicates that a past action or situation
               existed, but implies nothing about its ending. At the relevant past time,
               the action or situation might not have been over (it might have been con-
               tinuing). Ho is used in the intended meaning “was doing (something)”.
           (c) The punctual past preverb ma indicates that a past action took place in
               one moment, or is understood as completed at a moment in the past. If the
               intended meaning is “went and did (something)”, ma is used.
     The general past category in (75a) is very frequent; sentences that refer to past time
 often lack preverbs of time, especially in narratives describing successive events. This is
 shown in (76) with consecutive sentences from a story told by Florence Shaughnessy.
 (76)      (a) Hehlkue nee raayor’.
               “He ran along the bank.”
           (b) Kwesee kolchee kol’ ’okw’ hehlkue, neskwee ’emehl raayor’ kue ’yoch.
               “And once he was somewhere on the river bank, (and) the boat was passing
               near him.”                                                      FS 1951 (YL) Each verb in (76) refers to an event in a past-time narrative sequence; none occurs with
 a preverb of time.
     One way to contrast the past-time preverbs ho and ma in (75b–c) is in their use
 in answering questions. This is shown in Table 7.2 on page 67. If you ask what was¹ Linguists might use the terms imperfective and perfective rather than situational and punctual, but
  the terms used here may be clearer. Note that Yurok does have other past-time preverbs, such as ’ap, but these
  are less frequent than the two discussed here.

"
2.6      Particles
The term particle refers to a set of ﬁve different word classes which share two features:
all of them have relatively few words, ranging from only two articles to a few dozen
preverbs; and in all cases they cannot be used on their own to form utterances. Particles
occur only with other words. For example, since you can answer a question with just
an adverb, an adverb is not a particle: if someone asks where you’re going, you can just
answer lekwsee “outside”. A noun is not a particle because if someone asks what you want
to eat, you can say nepuy “salmon” by itself. But you cannot say words like keetee, ’ochkaa,
k’ee, or kwelekw on their own without being part of a larger phrase or sentence. The ﬁve
Yurok word classes that can be regarded as particles are detailed in §§2.6.1–2.6.5.",[51]
"2.6.3 Discourse particles
The term discourse particle refers to the class of words that includes hes, kem “also, even”,
kwelekw, to’, and tue’. Most Yurok discourse particles tend to occur near the beginnings
of sentences, and while a few have uses that are easy to describe (for example see §9.3.1
on the question particle hes), many have very elusive meanings and will not be discussed
here.",[51]

Special symbols† A dagger or obelisk marks phrases or sentences that are unacceptable to ﬂuent speak-
     ers of a language; you cannot say them. For example, in English †Man the is old is
     impossible. Similarly, in Yurok, because a preverb like ’ochkaa must precede the
     verb, you cannot say †Kepoyuerek’ ’ochkaa.
* An asterisk marks Yurok expressions that are almost certainly possible, but that do
     not happen to be documented in recordings of speakers.
AcknowledgementsWe would not know what we know about Yurok without the patient work of ﬂuent
speakers who never stopped teaching their language. I had the good fortune to learn
from ’aawokw Aileen Figueroa, Jimmie James, Glenn Moore, Sr., Archie Thompson, and
Georgiana Trull. I have also spent many hours listening to, and reading transcripts of,
the voices of other Yurok speakers, including the elders of a century and longer ago;
those of the mid-twentieth century, such as Lowana Brantner, Frank Douglas, Florence
Shaughnessy, Alice Spott, and Robert Spott; and many others. All of them generously
shared their knowledge so their language can endure with its people.
    Also essential have been linguists of earlier generations who worked with ﬂuent
speakers to document Yurok, carefully studied aspects of its grammar, and published
valuable analyses of its patterns. The most important of these linguists is R. H. Robins,
whose book The Yurok language (1958) contains key observations on every page; this
book makes constant use of what he learned from Florence Shaughnessy and other
Yurok elders. Also invaluable is the work of Howard Berman, A. L. Kroeber, Paul Proulx,
Edward Sapir, and T. T. Waterman. These scholars created a lasting analytic framework
for the study of Yurok grammar.
    This book is intended for members of the Yurok community — language learners and
teachers — and is a direct result of their support and inspiration. Participants in the Yurok
Language Institute and grammar workshops have made helpful comments and sugges-
tions on grammar, handouts, and drafts of part of this book; they include Tammy Cairns,
Leo Canez, Georgiana Gensaw, Robert R. Kinney, Kate Lowry, Skip Lowry, Chelsea
Reed, Margo Robbins, Bessie Shorty, Britty Vigil, Lawrence Williams, and others. The
Yurok Tribe language program staff over the years — Victoria Carlson, James Gensaw,
Barbara McQuillen, Kathleen Vigil, and their colleagues and interns — are good friends
and engaging teachers. Long-time Yurok language teacher Kay Inong has played an im-
portant role in creating a language curriculum that informs the choice of topics covered
in this book. The Yurok Tribe language program poy ’we-son, Carole Lewis, deserves spe-
cial mention for her hard work and long-term vision in creating a program that inspires
communities throughout California. Thanks also to activist, artist, and Yurok language
teacher Annelia Hillman for kindly contributing original artwork to this book.
    Without two friends who changed my career, I would never have worked with the
Yurok language. Leanne Hinton introduced me to California language documentation
and revitalization, and has offered unstinting support. Juliette Blevins introduced me to
Yurok itself, persuaded me that a philologist could play a role in the community, and
talked with me for years about the grammar of the language. I am forever grateful to

PrefaceThis book is meant to be used by Yurok language teachers and advanced learners, in
support of language restoration in the Yurok community. That goal has determined the
contents and style of what follows. Linguists and other scholars may ﬁnd this useful
as well, but should be aware that it is not an academic reference grammar. All readers
should keep in mind that languages are best learned by speaking and listening; this is a
supplement to the spoken language.
    This is a combination, expansion, and revision of two earlier publications, Yurok verb
guide: 75 common verbs (2009, 78 pages) and Basic Yurok grammar (2010, 69 pages).
Those earlier books are completely superseded by this one; substantial content has been
added and signiﬁcant errors have been corrected.
    Part I (chapters 1–10) provides information about the sounds of Yurok and about
basic grammatical and vocabulary patterns. Many were identiﬁed by the Yurok Tribe
for teacher certiﬁcation purposes. Part II (chapters 11–25) introduces the meanings and
forms of the most common Yurok verbs. Over 200 different verbs are covered, in 117
numbered sections. Because Yurok verbs tend to pack more information into them than
English verbs, Yurok verbs usually have many different forms, indicating participants
in the action and sometimes also relations to other verbs in the sentence. Some Yurok
verbs have dozens of different forms. This makes a guide useful.
    Other grammatical topics are discussed only brieﬂy (such as some of the preverbs),
or are omitted entirely (such as reﬂexive and reciprocal verbs, locative forms of nouns,
and many sentence patterns). Advanced learners and teachers may consult R. H. Robins’s
1958 book The Yurok language: Grammar, texts, lexicon, written in a technical style for
linguists, and other linguistic publications. See the Bibliography on pages 299–300 for
details.","[27, 28, 29, 30]"

"  2.6.5 Preverbs
  A preverb is a kind of Yurok word that is short (one or two syllables) and ordinarily
  occurs before the verb, expressing meanings having to do with time, place, and direc-
  tion (among various other notions). The meanings expressed by preverbs are broardly
  similar to those expressed by adverbs, but adverbs can have much more speciﬁc mean-
  ings (like “tomorrow” or “over there”) and adverbs can occupy various positions in the
  sentence. Typical Yurok preverbs include ho (referring to past time), keech (referring to
  past and present time), and nue (referring to motion that takes place together with the
  verbal action). Some of the most common Yurok preverbs are listed here:
• Circumstance, manner, and relation: ’eekee, keekee, mehl, neekee, neenee noo, see, soo
• Direction and location: ’ee, nee, ’o, so
• Directed motion: nue
• Negation: ’eemee, mee, neemee
• Time: kee, keech, keet, keetee, keetue, kue, ma, ’ochkaa, wo  See chapter 7 for information about preverbs of time, and chapter 8 for information
  about preverbs of negation (§8.2), directed motion (§8.3), and other meanings (§8.4).
  Chapter 3  Nouns  This chapter will describe changes in plural nouns, referring to “more than one” (§3.1);
  the preﬁxes that mean “my”, “your”, etc. (§§3.2–3.3); and short forms of nouns (§3.4).","[52, 53, 54]"
"8.2.2.4 Negation and iterative verbs
There is one situation in which ho is regularly used in referring to past time: if a verb
is iterative, with the inserted element -eg- that means “always” or “regularly”, then ho is
used to express the meaning “used to”. This is illustrated in (133).
(133)   (a)   Neemee ho negepue’ nepuy.
              “Salmon used to be eaten.”                                           FS 1951 (YL)

          (b) Heekon neemee wee’ mehl ho regoowo’s ’oohl.

          (c) Chuelue mos ho legaay’ ’oohl.
              “A person couldn’t go through Bald Hills.”                                AS ∼1962 (WB) 8.3       Directed motion: Using nue
 The preverb nue expresses a directed motion sense: “go (and do something)”, “come
 (and do something)”.¹ Usually it is implied that the subject is in motion toward the place
 where the verbal action will take place. Examples are in (134–135). In (134) the transla-
 tion is “go” because the understanding in context is that motion is away from the speaker;
 in (135) the translation is “come” because the motion is toward the speaker.
 (134)    Motion away from the speaker
          (a) Nue hl’os.
              “Go get it!.’                                                             GT 2003 (YLCB)
          (b) Nue ’o’ch’es k’e-ch’eeshah.
              “Go feed your dogs.”                                                        LT 1922 (GR) (135)    Motion toward the speaker
          (a) Kol’ nue’ neps.
              “Come eat.”                                                               GT 2003 (YLCB)
          (b) See nue kweget.
              “You should come visit.”                                                         YL 1951 Occasionally, as in (136), with multiple subjects going here and there, there is no clear
 overall direction.
 (136)     To’ nue neenee tenem’.
           “There are a lot (of grasshoppers) going around.”                            AS ∼1962 (WB)
 8.3.1 Present and past time reference
 The preverb nue is common in commands, as in (134a–b). It is not used in past-time
 sentences, and it is not used in sentences with the durative present preverb ’ochkaa. But
 it is often used with the resultative preverb keech as in (137).
 (137)    Examples of keech nue “have gone to do something”
          (a) Keech nue kweget.
              “He’s gone visiting.”                                                      MM 1927 (ES)

          (c) Keech nue tmeego’.
              “They’ve gone hunting.”                                                          YL 1951

  view. Different speakers on different occasions may use these preverbs somewhat differently.

in the construction in (93), whose complement lies in the future.

sense is not that something will happen in the future, but that it can or may happen.

  7.5.1 Preverb comparisons
  The differences in meaning among the time-reference categories above can be subtle.
  Differences between the following pairs are brieﬂy described here:
• General present vs. resultative keech; see (96)
• Resultative keech vs. durative present ’ochkaa; see (97–100)
• Durative present ’ochkaa vs. inceptive keet; see (101)
• Resultative keech vs. inceptive keet; see (102–103)
• Inceptive keet vs. prospective keetee; see (104)
• Prospective keetee vs. modal future kee; see (105)      The difference between keech and the general present (with no preverb) is illustrated
  in (96).  (96)    (a)   Komchuechek’.
                “I know you.”                                                           JJ 2004 (JB)
          (b) Keech komchuechek’.
              “I know you now.”                                                         JJ 2004 (JB)  The example in (96a) was given as a good, positive answer to the question Komchuepa’
  hes? “Do you know me?” The example in (96b) would be appropriate if the speaker at
  ﬁrst could not remember the other person, and then suddenly recalled: “Oh, now I know
  you!” That is, keech signals a change of situation from not knowing to knowing.
     The difference between keech and ’ochkaa is illustrated in (97–100).  (97)    (a)   Keech swoo’mel’.
                “He stinks (from contact with something).”                                   YL 1951
          (b) ’Ochkaa swoo’mel’.
              “He stinks (naturally).”                                                       YL 1951  (98)    (a)   Keech no’oyek’.
                “I have shoes on.”                                                     JJ 2006 (AG)
          (b) ’Ochkaa no’oyek’.

                “They’ve gone spear-ﬁshing.”                                           FS 1980 (PP)

               “I’m pole-ﬁshing.”                                                           GT 2003 (YLCB) In each case in (97–100), in the (a) example keech is appropriate because there was a
 recent change of state. In each (b) example, ’ochkaa is appropriate because the action is
 presented as ongoing without a necessary starting or ending point.
     The difference between ’ochkaa and keet is illustrated by the example in (101), with
 two consecutive sentences.
 (101)     ’Ochkaa pekwoluem’ kue ’w-oleehl.
           Keet holeem’ ’we-no’os.
           “She’s peeling her hazel sticks.
           She’s starting to make a baby basket.”                                                JJ 2007 (LC) The ﬁrst sentence above, with ’ochkaa, describes an ongoing action (peeling hazel sticks)
 that may have been underway for a while; the second sentence indicates that this action
 is the ﬁrst step in making a baby basket.
     The difference between keech and keet is illustrated by the examples in (102–103).
 The verb kweskwesek’ in (102) means “I have a cold”. In (102a) the situation has changed
 so that the speaker already has a cold, whereas in (102b) the speaker is starting to have
 a cold, or is about to have a cold.
 (102)     (a) Keech kweskwesek’.
               “I have a cold.”                                                                 JJ 2006 (AG)
           (b) Keet kweskwesek’.
               “I’m catching a cold.”                                                           JJ 2006 (AG) The verb neskwechook’ in (103) means “arrive”. In (103a), the situation has changed so
 that the addressee has now arrived and is here. In (103b), the subject is starting to arrive
 (lit. “come near”) but has not yet arrived; actually having arrived would be expressed
 with keech.
 (103)     (a) Keech neskwechoom’.
               “(Finally) you’ve arrived.”                                                      AF 2002 (JB)
           (b) Keet neskwechok’w.
               “He’s coming.”                                                                 MM 1927 (ES)      The difference between keet and keetee is illustrated in (104).¹
 (104)     (a) Keet kwechkeesh.
               “He’s defecating.”                                                           FD ∼1962 (WB)
           (b) Keetee kwechkeeshek’.
               “I’m just about to defecate.”                                                FD ∼1962 (WB) As the translations indicate, keetee signiﬁes that the verbal action has not yet begun,
 while keet means it has begun.
     Finally, the future uses of kee differ from uses of keetee in two important ways. First,
 kee often has a nuance that suggests the English translation “shall” — it can convey a¹ The speaker in these examples used a more colloquial English translation than the one printed in (104).

with ﬁrst-person and second-person subjects. This is in contrast with keetee, which sim-
ply expresses a prediction about the future, and is typical with impersonal verbs or verbs
with inanimate subjects.
    Second, whereas keetee is often associated with a prediction for the near future or an
impending event, and can thus often be translated “about to”, kee carries no such impli-
cation. For example, in (105), the syntactic context in each case makes the time of the
verb with kee entirely indeﬁnite.(105)    (a)    Nek kwelekw neemee komchuemek’ kwen kol’ kee nepek’.
                “I don’t know when I will eat.”                                              JJ 2007 (LC)

Resultative keech can be combined with past-time and future-time preverbs. In each case
the meaning of the resulting combination is the sum of its elements: it means that the
76      /     Time reference with preverbs
subject of the verb is now in a state or circumstance (keech) in which he or she was doing
(ho), did (ma), or can do (kee) something.
   A common combination is keech ho. In many cases a good translation is just “have
done it”. For example, if someone asks “What are you doing?”, you might answer with a
keech ho sentence. Examples are in (106).
(106)   Examples of keech ho
        (a) Keech ho nep’ puuek.
            “He’s been eating deer.”                                         MM 1927 (ES)
        (b) Kel’ hes keech ho helomeyem’?
            “Have you danced yet?”                                                YL 1951
        (c) Kol’ keech ho hohkuemek’.
            “I’ve been working.”                                             FS 1951 (RHR)
        (d) Keech ho sloyhlkek’.
            “I’ve been ﬂattening eels.”                                       FS 1980 (PP)
        (e) Keech ho wey ’w-o’omepek’.
            “He had ﬁnished making his ﬁre.”                               DW 1906 (ALK)    A second combination, keech ma, does not mean “have been doing it” but more sim-
ply “has done it”, somewhat analogous to the English expression. An event happened in
the past (ma), but its effect is still present now (keech). Examples are in (107).
(107)   Examples of keech ma
        (a) Keech ma saawelek’.
            “I’ve gotten cold.”                                            GT 2003 (YLCB)
        (b) Keech ma markue’ kue ’n-oolehl.
            “My plants got eaten.”                                            FS 1980 (PP)
        (c) Yo’ keech ma tohpekwtom’.

thing)”; the “can” part of the meaning comes from kee and the “now” part from keech. An
example is in (108).
(108)   Keech kee ’na-’ahspee’moh.
        “Now we can drink.”                                                       YL 1951
Chapter 8Using other preverbs8.1 Using cho’ in exhortations
The preverb cho’ is mostly used with a second-person verb in commands directed by
the speaker to the addressee. For this reason, an English imperative is usually a good
translation. Singular non-bipersonal examples are in (109).
(109) Examples of cho’ in commands: Singular subjects
      (a) Cho’ skeryterrk’wenem’.
          “Put on your dress.”                                                   JJ 2006 (AG)
      (b) Reeek’ew cho’ raayuerem’.
          “Swim by the shore.”                                                   FS 1980 (PP)
      (c) Cho’ wek mehl hohkuemem’ mestok.
          “Make a mattress with this.”                                           FS 1980 (PP)Alternatively, as in (110), the verb with cho’ may be plural or collective.
(110) Examples of cho’ in commands: Plural and collective subjects
      (a) Cho’ neee’nowow’ mehl nepuy.
          “Watch for salmon.”                                                    FS 1951 (YL)
      (b) Cho’ nue pewahchkeye’mow’ ’o raak.
          “Go wash your faces in the stream.”                                    RS 1951 (YL)Given in (111) are examples of cho’ with bipersonal verbs.
(111) Examples of cho’ in commands: Bipersonal verbs
      (a) Cho’ nahchesem’.
          “Give it to her.”                                                      AF 2001 (JB)
      (b) Cho’ laayoluepa’.
          “Teach me.”                                                            AF 2002 (JB)    But cho’ is not precisely an“imperative” preverb. It can also be used in ﬁrst- and third-
person contexts, as in (112). In sentences like these, the addressee is not necessarily
responsible for following an instruction.

"  5.1 Overview
  Many details of verb formation are in chapters 5–6. First, an overview of some of the
  most important categories of inﬂected verbs may be useful. The speciﬁc categories iden-
  tiﬁed pertain to mood, a linguistic term which refers broadly to the type of sentence or
  clause that a verb appears in. Yurok inﬂected verbs have four different moods, as follows:
• indicative (discussed in this chapter): used in most simple statements and questions
• imperative (discussed in this chapter): used in direct commands
• subjunctive (§6.4): typically used when one verb is dependent on another verb
• attributive (§6.5): used in phrases that modify or stand in for nouns
38      /      Basic verb formation
    The four moods have somewhat different endings, and are used in different ways.
Given in (37) are forms of hegook’ “I walk, I go”: an indicative, an imperative, a subjunc-
tive, and an attributive.(37)    (a) indicative: Nek keetee hegook’ so Rek’woy.
            “I am going to go to Requa.”                                                         YL 1951
        (b) imperative: Hego’och so kue muenchey nahko’!
            “Go to the white board!”                                                  GT 2003 (YLCB)
        (c) subjunctive: Nek weet soneenepek’ kee ’n-egook’.
            “I think I will go.”                                                          FS 1980 (PP)
        (d) attributive: Soo smeykoluemee’ kue keech hegookween.
            “They miss the one who has gone.”                                             FS 1980 (PP)
5.2     Non-inﬂected verbs
Non-inﬂected verbs (abbreviated vn in the dictionary) have no endings. They are shorter
— sometimes a lot shorter — than their inﬂected counterparts; often they are used in
very common expressions. Table 5.1 lists some common non-inﬂected verbs, together
with their inﬂected counterparts.        non-inflected verbs                inflected counterparts        chahchew “it’s diﬃcult”

5.3.1 Singular e-class verbs
Table 5.2 shows how e-class verbs work for singular subjects, that is, where one person
does the verbal action; either I do it (1 sg); you (one person) do it (2 sg); or he, she, or
it does it (3 sg).                                  “run”          “push (it)”   “swim”                          1 sg    ro’opek’       myootek’      kepoyuerek’

hegolek’ (page 146) has several irregular forms, including hem’ “he, she says, tells” and
the imperatives hach’es and heks’es “tell him, her!”","[68, 69, 70, 71]"

in (130a) vs. “cannot go” in (130b).

8.2.2.3 Negation and keech
With the resultative preverb keech, the negation may appear before or after keech; the
difference is important. As seen in (131), negation + keech means “not yet”.
(131) Negation + keech “not yet”
      (a) Mos keech ’ee roo kee ’ue-kemeyeem’.
          “It is not time to go home yet.”                                      GT 2003 (YLCB)

(132) Keech + negation “no longer”
      (a) Keech neemee skuyen’.
           “Now it is no good.”                                                          YL 1951

" 10.2.1         Verbs in no’om- “how long”
 Verbs that begin with the relative root no’om- answer (or ask) the question “how long?”
 They typically refer to a distance, as in the examples in (189), where ’oteesh “a foot (in
 length)” and k’e-yah “your belly” indicate the length.
 (189)     (a) ’Oteesh no’omel’.
               “It was a foot long.”                                                           FS 1951 (YL)

           “Tomorrow he will be nine years old.”                                              VM 1994 (BJ)
 10.2.2         Verbs in son- “how”
 Verbs that begin with the relative root son- (or its variants sern-, soo-, or serr-) answer
 (or ask) the question “how?” They refer to a manner of being or doing, and must be
 used with a word or phrase that expresses the manner. For example, as in (191), the
 verb serrnerh “be (a particular) color, it is colored (thus)” requires an expression like
 won “differently”.
 (191)     Won nee kee serrnerh k’e-wa’aw.
           “Your ﬂoor will be a different color.”                                              JJ 2006 (AG) In the common expression in (192), skuy’ “good” likewise expresses manner with the
 verb soneenepek’ “I feel (a particular way)”.
 (192)     Skuy’ soneenepek’.
           “I feel good.”                                                                      JJ 2006 (AG) And the verb soonekw “go (in a particular direction, of a trail)” in (193) requires an ex-
 pression like pechkue “upriver” to express the direction.
 (193)     Pechkue soonekw kue laas.
           “The trail goes upriver.”                                                         GM 2004 (AG)¹ Linguists who study the Algonquian languages use this term because the meaning of elements like son-, tom-,
  or weno’om- is said to relate to the additional element in the sentence.

10.2.3        Verbs in tom- “how much”
Verbs that begin with the relative root tom- answer (or ask) the question “how much?”
They typically refer to an amount or quantity, and require an amount expression or a
place-holder like kues “how (much)?” or wek “this”. Examples of tomoyek’ “I am (a par-
ticular age or size)” are given in (194a–b).
(194)   (a) Wek tomoyek’.

amount)”, and tompeyok’ “I eat (a particular amount)”. In all cases the implication of the
root tom-, unless otherwise speciﬁed, is that the amount is relatively large.","[135, 136]"

 To ask when, two patterns are common: kues cho’ and kues noohl. The difference between

Chapter 10Vocabulary patterns10.1       Expressing “be”, “have”, and related meanings
In Yurok, meanings like “be” and “have” are expressed quite differently from the way they
are expressed in English. There is no Yurok verb or other word that has the same range
of uses as English be or have. Here a few important constructions that partly correspond
to thse English verbs are described: descriptive sentences (§10.1.1), nominal sentences
(§10.1.2), posture constructions (§10.1.3), and possession sentences (§10.1.4).","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"

Meaning and usage
This means (for a person, animal, or bird) to be or remain standing, or be standing in
a place, and thus it can also mean “be located” more generally. Examples are in (373);
underlined words or phrases express the location.

Verbs with similar meanings
The most common verbs with a similar meaning are koo’opek’ “I stand up” and the non-
inﬂected forms koo’ and ko’oh (page 262). The difference between these verbs and ’oolo’
(’oolo’oh, ’oolo’opek’) is that ’oolo’ means “be standing, be located (in a standing position)”
and is therefore used for describing or identifying the location of a person (or animal
or bird), whereas koo’opek’ and its close relatives mean “assume a standing position” or
“move to a standing position” and thus usually involve some change.

Meaning and usage
This verb refers to a person, animal, or thing that is in a lying posture. A location is
usually expressed:

Verbs with similar meanings
The pair of verbs kmoyhlkesek’ and kmoyhl have meanings very similar to ’oyhlkesek’ and
’oyhl, all of them refering to being in a lying position. By contrast, ’ooleenek’ (p. 264)“I lie
down” refers to a change of position. Someone who is standing up would use ’ooleenek’,
for example to say “now I am going to lie down”, while somone who is already lying
down could use ’oyhlkesek’ or ’oyhl.","[295, 296, 297]"
" 1.1.3.5       Rules affecting preverb–verb combinations
 The consonant at the beginning of a verb is sometimes affected by the vowel of an im-
 mediately preceding preverb. This always depends on speech rate; it is more likely in
 more conversational or ﬂuid speech. There are two relevant rules.
     One rule applies to h at the beginning of a verb. Whenever h is immediately preceded
 by a preverb ending in a vowel, then h changes to another consonant. If the vowel is ee,
 then h changes to y; after any other vowel, it changes to g.¹ In the examples in (10), the¹ In older stories, h often changes to l. This pattern was described by Juliette Blevins and Andrew Garrett, “The
  rise and fall of l-sandhi in California Algic” (2007; for the full reference see the Bibliography on page 299).

  words beginning with g are basically hoh “make”, hookwch’ “s/he gambled”, and hak’ws
  “s/he laughed”.
  (10)    The change h → g
          (a) Keech ho goh per’erk.
               “I made dried mussels.”                                            FS 1980 (PP)
          (b) Kue ’o’rowee’ kem ’o gookwch’.

          (c) Yo’ ho gak’ws.
               “He laughed.”                                                             YL 1951  In (11), the h of hem’ “s/he said” becomes g and the h of hegook’ “I go” becomes y.
  (11)    Kwesee ’o gem’, Chyuue’, tue’ kee yegook’.
          “So he said, ‘Well, I will go.’ ”                                       FS 1951 (YL)      The second rule applies to s at the beginning of a verb. Whenever s is immediately
  preceded by a preverb ending in ee, then it is pronounced as sh. For example, as in (12),
  when the word son’ “it is (thus)” or sonowok’ “I do (thus)” is preceded by keetee or kee, it
  is pronounced with word-initial sh.
  (12)    The change s → sh
          (a) Wey’ keetee shon’.
               “This is going to happen.”                                         FS 1980 (PP)

  1.1.4 Twentieth century pronunciation changes
  All languages change all the time. During the last hundred years, Yurok has changed in
  several ways. If you listen to old recordings or read old transcriptions (or publications),
  you may encounter pronunciations that are less common today. The following are some
  of the most notable Modern Yurok pronunciation changes:
• The variant of the g phoneme that sounds like English g has become more common
  (§1.1.3.1).
• The variant of the w phoneme that sounds like English w has become more common
  (§1.1.3.2).
• The tense variant of the e phoneme more often has the quality of the vowel of English
  bait (§1.1.3.3).
• Some unstressed vowels are likelier to have the neutral quality of the ﬁrst vowel in
  English about.
  These changes reﬂect a process called accommodation, in this case between Yurok
  and English; this is a process that happens when people who are bilingual unconsciously
  adapt their speech to the speech of other people they talk with. Accommodation is a sign
  of linguistic adaptability and strength, a process that happens in all healthy languages all
  the time; speakers of Modern Yurok are as ﬂuent as any earlier generations of speakers.

1.2     Major differences between English and Yurok
When you learn a second language as an adult, your ﬁrst language always inﬂuences
your new language. For example, usually you have an accent in your second language;
you do not sound like somebody who grew up speaking that language. To reduce your
accent and what you carry over from your ﬁrst language, it can be helpful to focus on
major differences between the two languages.
    Six major differences between English and Yurok are described here; if you pay atten-
tion to these differences, your Yurok may sound less English-inﬂuenced. You can hear
recordings of most words below on the Yurok Language Project website (linguistics.
berkeley.edu/~yurok).","[41, 42, 43]"
"
¹ The second syllable of hlker’merkerhlkeenek’ “I tie a knot” is not stressed, though it follows a heavy syllable;
  this appears to contradict the pattern. The reason for this exception is that this Yurok stress pattern never
  affects a single light syllable surrounded by two heavy syllables; such syllables are not stressed.

  Chapter 2  Word classes  In any language, words can be grouped into various classes, which are deﬁned partly by
  their meaning and partly by how they are used in sentences. It is useful to identify the
  word classes of a language because then you can make general statements about them,
  such as “Yurok nouns do not usually change according to whether they are singular or
  plural” and “Yurok preverbs are positioned before the verb”.
      Though there are many similarities across languages, word classes do differ from
  language to language. For example, English has a class of adjectives; Yurok does not.
  In Yurok, the meanings that are expressed by English adjectives are instead expressed
  by the class of verbs. Likewise, English has no class of preverbs despite the importance
  of this word class in Yurok grammar. English also lacks non-inflected verbs.
      Every Yurok word belongs to one of the ten word classes below.","[46, 47, 48]"

        (a) Nek komchuemek’ wee k’e-mehl hesek’.

 6.5 Attributive verbs
 Every inﬂected Yurok verb has attributive forms. These have distinctive endings and a
 set of uses that sometimes correspond to modiﬁers in English, sometimes to nouns, and
 sometimes to phrases with meanings like “the one who steals” or “the boy who ran fast”.
 The attributive phrases that are formed with attributive verbs can be understood
 informally as descriptive phrases; they serve to characterize or describe a noun or a
 referent under discussion.¹
     The most common patterns for forming attributive verbs are shown in Table 6.8.                                                              o-class or                oo-class

                        “know it”           “eat”             “take care of it”         “go, leave”                                 Table 6.8: Attributive verb paradigms As the table shows, all ﬁrst-person (singular and plural) attributives have an ending
 -oh, similar to the 1 pl ending of indicative verbs. Second-person attributives distin-
 guish singular and plural endings, and have different patterns for e-class vs. o- and oo-
 class verbs. Note that oo-class verbs with 3 sg forms in -ok’w have 3 sg attributives in
 -okween. Collective ﬁrst- and second-person attributives are identical to indicatives; the
 third-person forms are distinct.
     By far the most common attributive forms in use are third-person forms (singular,
 plural, and collective). Their use to modify nouns is illustrated in (61–62). Given ﬁrst,
 in (61), are examples with the pattern Attributive + Noun.² (61)      Attributive + Noun
           (a)     kerkue’yermercheen laayekws
                   “a crooked trail” (kerkue’yermercherk’ “I walk crookedly”)                       FS 1980 (PP)
           (b) nuemee peleen leyes
               “a very big snake” (peloyek’ “I am big”)                                             AF 2001 (JB)
¹ Attributive verbs are used to form what linguists call relative clauses. A relative clause that consists of only
  an attributive verb can function like an agent noun, the equivalent of English baker, hunter, etc. Note that
  a number of details of attributive formation and usage are omitted here. More information can be found in
  R. H. Robins’s The Yurok language (1958) and Howard Berman’s “Subordinate clauses in Yurok: A preliminary
  report” (1972); for full references see the Bibliography on page 299.
² Note that che’lonee in (61c) is strictly speaking a passive attributive, as che’lee’ is passive.

do not clearly show it, but in general the pattern in (62) is used for longer or more
complex attributive phrases. The pattern in (61) tends to be used for shorter or one-
word attributive phrases.
(62)    Noun + kue + Attributive
        (a) kue meweemor kue wee’ megetohlkwomeen

a noun) is interpreted as “one who does” whatever the verb refers to. Since they refer to
the subjects of verbs, these can be called subject attributive phrases.

"¹ Subjunctive verbs were called pronominal-prefix verbs in R. H. Robins’s The Yurok language (1958; for the
  full reference see the Bibliography on page 299). A subjunctive non-inﬂected verb is in fact indistinguishable
  from a possessed noun; the word ’ue-pa’ah may be interpreted as “for it to be wet” (non-inﬂected verb) or
  “its water” (noun). An alternative linguistic term for subjunctives might be subordinative, because they are
  associated with subordinate clauses.

 6.4.2 Using subjunctives
 There are many contexts where subjunctives are used. Only a few very common ones
 are described here. The most common context generally is when one verb is subordi-
 nated to another verb.¹ Examples of this type were given in (55–56) above: the verbs
 skewok “want” (non-inﬂected) and skewokseemek’ “I want” (inﬂected) have only subjunc-
 tive complement clauses. Examples showing subjunctives with verbs that mean “thank
 you (for . . .)” or “I am glad (that . . .)” appear in (57).² (57)      (a)     Tewomehl kee k’e-megelook’.
                   “I’m glad that you came with me.”                                            GT 2007 (LC)
           (b) Wokhlew ’ne-newochek’.
               “I’m glad to see you.”                                                        MR ∼1970 (MRo)
           (c) Koweeshcho’ k’ee ma k’er-nergery.
               “Thank you for helping.”                                                        FS 1951 (RHR)
¹ Strictly speaking, the type of subordination at issue is complementation. Attributive verbs (§6.5) are used
  in another subordinate clause type, the relative clause.
² Learners will note that in Classical Yurok not all speakers used the words wokhlew and koweeshcho’ in the
  same way they are used today.
56      /      Additional verb types
Other instances of this pattern (subjunctive verbs subordinated to another verb in the
context) are found with verbs like nekomuy “know how (to do something)” and chahch-
esek’ “I am tired (of doing something)” and expressions like keech ’ee roo “it is time (to do
something)” and keech ’ee son’ “people are ready (to do something)”. These are illustrated
in (58).","[85, 86, 87]"
"10.2.4        Verbs in weno’om- “how far”
Verbs that begin with the relative root weno’om- answer (or ask) the question “how far?”
They typically refer to a location (in space or time), and are used only in sentences where
an additional word or phrase indicates the location. In (195a), for example, the location
is indicated by wee’ “that (place)”, and in (195b) it is expressed by poyew noohl “far ahead”.
(195)   (a) Kel’ kem wee’ ho weno’omuerem’.
            “You too swam there.”                                                      YL 1951
        (b) Poyew noohl weno’omor’ kue mewah.
            “The boy is running far ahead.”                                            YL 1951The relative roots no’om- and weno’om- are similar; the difference is that weno’om- verbs
express how far along something has moved, while no’om- expresses how long some-
thing is (not necessarily in motion). For example, while no’omek’ means “it (a worm-
or roped-shaped object) is long”, weno’omoksee’hl “it is a (speciﬁed) season” refers to the
metaphorical motion of time.",[136]
"10.1.2        Nominal sentences
In English, forms of the verb be are used in sentences like This is a salmon, I am a doctor,
and My pets are cats. In such sentences, somebody or something is said to be a person or
thing; a be + noun construction is used. In Yurok, by contrast, the noun itself is used with
no verb that means “is” or “be” — a construction sometimes called a nominal sentence;
the noun or noun phrase itself is sometimes called a predicate nominal. Examples are
100        /      Vocabulary patterns
in (178–179). It is common for nominal sentences to include the pronoun wee’, as in
(178); the predicate nominal is underlined.
(178)     Examples of “X (is) Y” with wee’
          (a) Segep wee’ kue nepuy.
              “That salmon (was) Coyote.”                                       MM 1927 (YT)
          (b) Kel’ kee nepuy wee’.

              “A toad (is) a woman.”                                           AS ∼1962 (WB)
          (d) Nek kwelekw wee’ neemuech ’ne-tektoh.

"Classical Yurok. This term refers to the usage of Yurok speakers recorded in the ﬁrst
     half or two thirds of the 20th century, those born before about 1900–1910. (These
     include Lowana Brantner, Florence Shaughnessy, Robert Spott, and many other
     people.)
Modern Yurok. This term refers to the usage of Yurok speakers recorded late in the
     20th century and early in the 21st century, those born after about 1900–1910.
     (These include the most active teachers of the last generation.)TerminologyYou do not need to know special terminology to speak a language. Yurok children learned
their language perfectly, and elders spoke masterfully and subtly in the language, for
centuries with no linguists. But linguistic terminology is helpful if you want to talk about
the structure or the use of a language.1st, 2nd, 3rd person. Verbs have ﬁrst-, second-, and third-person forms: 1st person
      means that the subject is “I” or “we”; 2nd person means that the subject is “you”
      (singular or plural); and 3rd person means that the subject is “he”, “she”, “it”, or
      “they”.
Impersonal verb. An impersonal verb is a verb that has no subject; the usual imper-
      sonal verbs concern weather and other situations that need not involve any par-
      ticipants. See §2.1 on page 17. A Yurok example is tenpewe’hl “it is raining”.
Intransitive verb. An intransitive verb is a verb that has a subject but no object. See
      §2.1 on page 17. An English example is walk; a Yurok example is ro’opek’ “I run”.
Noun. See §2.3 on page 19.

Object. Some verbs have an object as well as a subject; the object is the person or thing
     affected or targeted by the action. In English, for example, that rock is the object
     in the sentences I saw that rock and I threw that rock.
Plural. A plural noun or verb refers to more than one person or thing (in the case of
     verbs, usually the subject but occasionally the object).
Preﬁx. A preﬁx is a piece of a longer word that is added to the beginning of the word,
     such as English un- in unhappy) or Yurok ’ne- in ’ne-’yoch “my boat”.
Singular. A singular noun or verb refers to one person or thing (in the case of verbs,
     usually the subject but occasionally the object).
Subject. Almost every verb has a subject: the person or thing that does the action,
     or that experiences or undergoes the state expressed by the verb. In English, for
     example, that rock is the subject in the sentences Yesterday that rock fell on my car
     and That rock was big.
Suﬃx. A suﬃx is a piece of a longer word that is added to the end of the word, such as
     English -ness in happiness or Yurok -ek’ in skewokseemek’ “I like it”.
Transitive verb. A transitive verb is a verb that requires an object and a subject. See
     §2.1 on page 17. An English example is see; a Yurok example is newook’ “I see it”.

 16.11           Wokhlew “be thankful”
 Grammatical description: intransitive non-inﬂected verb
 Variant: wokhlew’ with a glottalized w’
 Related verb
       • Classical Yurok wokhlee’ “it is pleasing”¹
 Meaning and usage
 In Modern Yurok, wokhlew is mostly used either as a general expression like English
 thank you, or more speciﬁcally to express thanks in prayer; some speakers use it only
 in prayer. In Classical Yurok, in addition to its use in prayers, it was used to mean “I am
 glad, grateful, or thankful”, often with a subjunctive verb expressing what the speaker is
 grateful for. Examples are in (274).
 (274)     (a) Wokhlew keech k’e-neskwechook’.
               “I am glad that you have come.”                                                      FS 1951 (YL)
           (b) Wokhlew ’ne-newochek’.
               “I am glad to see you.”                                                        MR ∼1970 (MRo)
 Verbs with similar meanings
 In Modern Yurok the word koweeshcho’ “thank you (especially for food)” has similar
 uses, though it is not a verb. Similar in meaning to the Classical Yurok “be glad, thankful”
 are tewomehlkook’ “I am happy” and tewomehl “be happy” (page 178).","[209, 210, 211]"
"Inﬂected forms
Every inﬂected verb in Yurok has numerous possible forms. Many of these are given for
reference in the chapters that follow. Essential grammatical terminology is explained
in chapter 5, beginning on page 37; see also the Glossary of terminology and symbols,
beginning on page xix.
    For all verbs, ordinary (indicative) forms are given, and in most cases subjunctive,
attributive, and imperative forms. For many verbs, collective plurals are included. For
transitive verbs, passive and bipersonal forms are often given.
    Readers should note that not every form cited here has been documented. In fact,
most of the forms cited have not been documented, but are presented according to the
regular grammatical patterns of the Yurok language. On page 121, for example, the 1 pl
subjunctive of hohkuemek’ “I make” is given as ’n-ohkuemoh even though this precise
form has not been recorded. But other subjunctive forms are documented, and the for-
mation of 1 pl subjunctives is quite regular as far as is known.
    The use of predictable but undocumented forms is not desirable; ideally, every word
in a book like this would be checked with a ﬂuent ﬁrst-language speaker. But this is un-
fortunately no longer possible. Academic researchers and others who prefer to make use
of only those forms that were actually documented from a ﬂuent ﬁrst-language speaker
should consult the corpus of Yurok data at linguistics.berkeley.edu/~yurok.

    serrhlerperk’ “I do (so)” (p. 126)         weykook’ “I ﬁnish it” (p. 134)Among the verbs that have to do with “being”, the difference between the two most
general is that sonowok’ refers to being a certain way (such as well or poorly), while ’ook’
is used (for example) to identify the place where something is.
    The most general verbs that have to do with “doing” are hohkuemek’, serrhlerperk’,
and sonkook’. Of these, hohkuemek’ is outcome-oriented (it refers to ﬁxing, making, or
preparing something), while serrhlerperk’ and sonkook’ are process-oriented; they refer
to how a person is acting. The difference is that serrhlerperk’ refers generally to acting
in some way, while sonkook’ means “act on something (do to something) in some way”;
in both cases the way must be further speciﬁed.

 The term basic subject may be useful to avoid ambiguity in referring to the subject of
 a non-passive verb.² For example, the basic subject of newook’ “I see it” and newoyek’ “I¹ Note that passive forms like hohkelek’ need not have the unlikely meaning “somebody made or repaired me”

ipant who is affected by the action. This is especially common for plural basic subjects
that might be translated as “they” or “people” (in general).(51)     (a)   Hesem’ hes newoyem’?
               “Do you think they see you?”

52      /      Additional verb types
   As illustrated in (52), passives are also sometimes used when the basic subject is
overtly expressed — kue puesee “that cat” in (52a) and kue meges “the doctor” in (52b).
Typically, in such cases the focus of attention is not the basic subject but the participant
who is affected by the action.
(52)    (a) Newook’ kue puesee sesomenoyem’.
            “I saw that cat scratch you.”

While the verbs discussed above have endings that indicate the subject, Yurok also has
verbs with endings that indicate both the subject and the object. These are called biper-
sonal verbs, and can be used when the object of the verb refers to a person (or an animal
behaving like a person, for example in a story). Examples are in (53–54). The verbs in
(53) all end in -chek’ and involve a subject “I” and an object “you”, such as ko’moyochek’
“I hear you” in (53a).
(53)    (a) Nek ko’moyochek’.
            “I heard you.”                                                      AF 2001 (JB)
        (b) Nekee’ meskwochek’.
            “I’m treating you with medicine.”                                GT 2007 (YLCB)
        (c) Kee ’orechek’.
            “I’m going to owe you money.”                                       FS 1980 (PP)The verbs in (54) all end in -pa’ and involve a subject “you” and an object “me”, such as
laayoluepa’ “you teach me”.
(54)    (a) Skuy’ soo laayoluepa’.
            “You teach me well.”                                                JJ 2006 (AG)
        (b) Cho’ chpeenahpeepa’ ’owookpaa!
            “Wait for me until the day after tomorrow.”                             YL 1951Generally, if a verb’s object is a person — “me, you, her, him, us, them” — then a biper-
sonal form is usually used. Some speakers use them regularly only in examples like
(53–54) where “I” and “you” are involved, especially in Modern Yurok, but most speak-
ers use a broad range of bipersonal forms as appropriate. Full bipersonal paradigms of
numerous individual verbs are given throughout chapters 14–24.","[81, 82, 83]"

 Chapter 4 Articles and pronouns Articles and pronouns belong to different word classes, as discussed in chapter 2, but
 they nonetheless share an important feature of meaning. Both can express meaning dis-
 tinctions that involve proximity and distance, such as “near” vs. “far”, or “this” vs. “that”.¹
 4.1 Pronouns
 4.1.1 Personal pronouns
 Personal pronouns in Yurok are words that refer to speakers and addressees — the equiv-
 alent of English I, me, and you. Table 4.1 lists the personal pronouns that are documented
 in Modern Yurok.²                                     singular       plural      contrastive        objective                    1st person       nek            nekah       nekee’             nekach

 “we, us” and kelew “you” are very common. They are not simply the equivalent of the
 English subject pronouns I and you. In addition to being used as subjects of sentences,
 they are used as objects of prepositions like ho, mehl, and ’o. This is illustrated in (21).","[60, 61, 62]"

Grammatical description: intransitive e-class verbMeaning and usage

speciﬁed by some further word or phrase in the sentence (see §10.2.3). Some examples
will clarify its use:

  There are four main present-oriented categories of time reference:
• general present. This refers to verbs that have no time-reference preverbs. Such verbs
  can refer generally to the present or the recent past. For example, ko’moyok’ can mean “I
  hear it” or “I heard it”, and you might ask somebody ko’moyom’ hes? “did you hear it?”
• resultative. The preverb keech indicates that something is so because it recently came
  to be and the new situation now exists. Somebody may have just done something, or
  a situation may have just come to exist. It implies that some action or event has been
  completed, and a new situation now exists. Good translations will vary depending on
  the verb; they may include the words “now” or “has X-ed”.
• durative. The preverbs ’ochkaa and wo’nee indicate that an action is ongoing at the
  time of speaking, without implying anything about its duration or whether it recently
  started. Often a good translation is “doing it right now”.
• inceptive. The preverb keet indicates that the action described by the verb is beginning.
  A good translation is usually “is starting”.
                                                             Time reference with preverbs         /        69
 The general present category is very frequent; in other words, it is common for present-
 referring sentences to lack preverbs of time. This is illustrated in (83), where (83b) in
 particular makes the present time reference clear with we’yk’oh “now”.
 (83)      (a) Mewah heemar ’o koo’op’ kue tepoo.

"  1.1.3.2 The phoneme w
  The phoneme w has two pronunciation variants:
• The most common Modern Yurok variant is identical to English w.
• A common Classical Yurok variant is a slightly stronger articulation with air passing
  between the tongue and the roof of the mouth and with the lips rounded. This is a com-
  bination of w and the weak variant of g.
  If you listen carefully to recordings of words like newook’ “I see it”, you will hear both
  pronunciations.³ ¹ Technically, this is a velar fricative [G].
 ² Technically, this is a velar glide [î].
 ³ Technically, the second variant is a labialized velar fricative [Gw ]). It was often written gw by anthropologists
   and other non-Yurok people in the early twentieth century. Yurok does not have a “gw” combination.
8     /       The sounds of Yurok
                        Figure 1.1: Yurok language camp at ’Ohpoh, 20141.1.3.3    The phoneme e
The phoneme e has three pronunciation variants. First, if e is stressed in the last syllable
of a word (or the only syllable of a one-syllable word), the open pronunciation is used.
Open e is intermediate between the vowels in English head and had. Open e is found in
the ﬁnal syllable of the words in (1).
(1)       Open e
          (a) One-syllable words: chekws “heart”, mech “ﬁre”, ’yekwhl “maggot”
          (b) Two-syllable words with open e before w or y: Chuerey “Trinidad”, Hop’ew
              “Klamath”, perey “old woman”
          (c) Other two-syllable words: chewes “hand”, keekwten “moss”, keeshen “sum-
              mer”, pontet “ashes”
Open e is sometimes spelled “a” by users of the Yurok Alphabet, but it is not the same
as the vowel in English had; nor does it have the same quality as the a vowels in Yurok
ma (past time preverb), ch’eeshah “dog”, or chaahl “beach”.
    Second, if e is stressed in the ﬁrst syllable of a word with more than one syllable,
the tense pronunciation is used (but not before r). Tense e is intermediate between lax
e and the vowel sound of English hate and bait; for some but not all Yurok speakers it
may be identical to that English sound. In each word in (2), the ﬁrst vowel is a tense e
and the second e is either open (if it is in the ﬁnal syllable) or lax.
                                                           The sounds of Yurok     /      9
(2)     Tense e
        (a) Repetitive verbs: slekwslekw “put clothes on”, tekwtekwsook’ “I cut it up”,
             tektekon’ “it’s sticky”
        (b) Nouns and non-inﬂected verbs: chekwchem “black acorns”, keget “mountain
             lion”, keychek “tired”, kweget “visit”, legech “mudhen”, segep “coyote”
Tense e is spelled “ey” in the Yurok Alphabet, but is not the same sound as the combi-
nation of e plus y. That combination occurs in words like cheykenee “small”, and is also
spelled “ey” in the Yurok Alphabet.
    Third, in all other contexts (wherever open and tense e are not used), the lax pro-
nunciation is used. Lax e is the same as the vowel sound of English head.
    Open and tense e only occur in stressed syllables and only in adverbs, interjections,
nouns, pronouns, and verbs — not in the various particle word classes (see §2.6). Oth-
erwise, there are very few exceptions to the rules above; one common exception is hesek’,
whose ﬁrst syllable has a lax vowel rather than the tense vowel.
    The relationships among the variant pronunciations of e can clearly be seen when
the same vowel, in a related word, undergoes a change because its word position has
changed. Several such examples are in (3–6). In each case, the ﬁrst word has a tense e
that becomes open e in the related second word. For example, in each verb pair in (3),
the ﬁrst form is a 1 sg verb with tense e in the initial syllable and the second form is the
corresponding 3 sg verb with an open e.
(3)     Tense e → Open e: Verb pairs
        (a) chkeyek’ “I sleep” → chkey’ “s/he sleeps”
        (b) nekek’ “I put it” → nek’ “s/he puts it”
        (c) nepek’ “I eat” → nep’ “s/he eats”
In each noun pair in (4), the ﬁrst form is a full noun with tense e in the initial syllable
and the second form is the corresponding short form with an open e (on short forms see
§3.4 beginning on page 27).
(4)     Tense e → Open e: Noun pairs
        (a) lewet “net” → ’ne-lew “my net”
        (b) ’leptoyhl “hair” → ’ne-’lep “my hair”
        (c) pekcheech “rope” → ’ue-pek “his or her rope”
        (d) ’ne-k’ep’ch’em → ’ne-k’ep’ “my daughter-in-law”
In each word pair in (5), the ﬁrst word is a longer noun or verb with tense e in the
initial syllable and the second form is an iterative with an open e (on iteratives see §6.6
beginning on page 59).
(5)     Tense e → Open e: Iteratives
        (a) meskwoh “medicine” → meges “doctor”
        (b) sepolah “prairie” → segep “coyote” (“goes on the prairies”)
        (c) tetolo’hl → teget “cry”
Finally, in the miscellaneous related word pairs in (6), the ﬁrst example in each case has
tense e in an initial syllable and the second example has open e in a ﬁnal syllable.

 Compare also the suﬃx -etew- “hand, ﬁnger”, whose second vowel is open e in pletew
 “thumb” and sketew “little ﬁnger”, but lax e in the longer words in (7).

 1.1.3.4       Preﬁx and suﬃx er and err
 Preﬁxes and suﬃxes added to words with the vowels er and err tend to be inﬂuenced
 by those vowels. The affected preﬁxes include possessive ’ne- “my’, our’, k’e- “your”, and
 ’we- “his, her, its, their” (discussed in §3.2); the affected suﬃxes include endings like 1st
 person -ek’, 2nd person -om’, etc.
     When a preﬁx or suﬃx containing a, o, or e is added to a word that has er or err in it,
 then a, o, or e tend to change to er; the long vowels aa and oo likewise tend to change to
 long err. (Usually this does not have any effect on ee or ue.) Examples are given in (8)
 for the preﬁxes ’ne- and ’ke-, and in (9) for the suﬃxes -ek’ and -oom’.
 (8)       The change to er in preﬁxes

 and less likely in slower speech or when a speaker is pronouncing words carefully.","[38, 39, 40, 41]"
"  1.1.2.3   The letter e
  The letter e is used here for three related but distinct sounds, only one of which is iden-
  tical to an English sound:
• lax e. This is the vowel sound in kem “also”, mehl “because of, from”, etc. This sound is
  identical to the vowel sound in English bed and head.
• tense e. This is the vowel sound in the first syllable of nepuy “salmon”, newook’ “I see
  it”, segep “coyote”, etc. This sound is intermediate in pronunciation between lax e and the
  vowel sound of English hate and bait; for some but not all Yurok speakers it is identical
  to that English sound.
• open e. This is the vowel sound in the last syllable of kweget “visit”, segep “coyote”,
  etc. This sound is intermediate in pronunciation between lax e and the vowel sound of
  English hat and bat.
  In the Yurok Alphabet, tense e is spelled “ey”, and open e is sometimes spelled “a”; the
  Yurok Alphabet uses spellings like “ney-puy” “salmon” and also sometimes “sey-gap”
  “coyote”. In this book, however, a single symbol e is instead used for all three sounds
  above. This is done for several reasons. There is variation among speakers and even in
                                                                            The sounds of Yurok           /        7
  the speech of a single speaker on different occasions: a word that usually has a tense
  e, like the ﬁrst vowel in nepek’ “I eat”, is sometimes pronounced with a lax e. This can
  happen in hundreds of words; it would be cumbersome to spell them all in two different
  ways.
       In addition, the symbol ey is used here for the combination e + y, as in cheykenee
  “small”, which is not the same as the tense e in nepuy; and lax e is not the same as the a
  in pa’ah “water” or raak “creek”.
       Most importantly, the three different e sounds are related in such a way that the
  pronunciation in a given word is usually predictable. When sounds have a predictable
  relationship in a language, they are considered variants of a phoneme (basic sound). The
  three variants of the Yurok phoneme e are distributed according to the rules in §1.1.3.3.","[37, 38]"

differ in that hesek’ highlights the content of a thought and soosek’ highlights the type
of thought. The four main perception verbs above can be classiﬁed as shown in the fol-
lowing table:                           source-oriented            experiencer-oriented               hearing     ko’moyok’    “I hear it”   chpa’royok’   “I listen”
               sight       newook’      “I see it”    neee’nek’     “I look at it”In each modality — hearing and sight — there is a source-oriented verb as well as an
experiencer-oriented verb. The source-oriented verb highlights the source of the sound
or sight; you do not usually choose whether to hear or see something. The experiencer-
oriented verb highlights the activity of the subject, who can try to listen or look at some-
thing of interest. The English translations also convey the same meaning.

 The subjunctive preﬁxes and endings are shown in Table 6.7 on page 55. The forms in
 this table have preﬁxes; their endings make singular forms look like 1 sg verbs, but pre-
 ﬁxes disambiguate key forms. Examples of subjunctive clauses (underlined) with skewok
 are given in (55) for statements and in (56) for questions.",[85]
"¹ In his book The Yurok language (1958), R. H. Robins used the term “intensive” to describe what are here called
  iterative verbs. These verbs were studied in detail by Andrew Garrett, “Reduplication and inﬁxation in Yurok”
  (2001), and Esther Wood, The semantic typology of pluractionality (2007), chapter 4 (for full references see
  the Bibliography on page 299).
60        /     Additional verb types
6.6.1 Forming iteratives
To form an iterative verb, in most cases the vowel-consonant sequence -eg- is inserted
before the ﬁrst vowel of the verb. (Equivalently, -eg- is inserted after the ﬁrst consonant
or group of consonants.) Some examples of this pattern are shown in Table 6.9.          basic (non-iterative) verb         iterative verb     a    chyuuek’wenek’   “I sit down”      chyeguuek’wenek’    “I frequently sit down”

          nepek’           “I eat”           negepek’            “I frequently eat”
          saa’agochek’     “I speak Yurok”   segaa’agochek’      “I frequently speak Yurok”
     b    chahchew         “be diﬃcult”      chegahchew          “be frequently diﬃcult”
          ho’omah          “make a ﬁre”      hego’omah           “make a lot of ﬁres”
          ten              “rain”            tegen               “frequently rain”
          teykelew         “bite”            tegeykelew          “bite a lot”       Table 6.9: Basic iterative verb forms (a inﬂected verbs; b non-inﬂected verbs)As the examples show, iteratives can be formed from inﬂected or non-inﬂected verbs.
    In addition to the basic pattern in Table 6.9, there are three variant iterative patterns
for verbs of special forms. First, if a verb begins with a glottal stop (’), then the iterative
verb inserts -e’g- rather than -eg-. Examples are in (66).
(66)      Iteratives formed from verbs beginning with a glottal stop (’)
          (a) ’ahspuemek’ “I drink it” → ’e’gahspuemek’
          (b) ’oloyew “call, hoot, make noise” → ’e’goloyew
          (c) ’omeemoh “speak Hupa” → ’e’gomeemoh
     Second, if a verb’s ﬁrst vowel is an e followed by g or k (including glottalized k’), then
its iterative often changes the vowel to the long vowel eee. Examples are given in (67).
(67)      Iteratives formed from verbs with -eg-, -ek-
          (a) chpegor’ “hold a race” (non-inﬂected) → chpeeegor’
          (b) kweget “visit” (non-inﬂected) → kweeeget
          (c) nekek’ “I put it (somewhere)” → neeekek’
    Finally, if a verb’s ﬁrst vowel is an e followed by kw or w (including glottalized k’w,
’w), then its iterative often changes the vowel to the long vowel uue. Examples are given
in (67).
(68)      Iteratives formed from verbs with -ekw-, -ew-
          (a) hew “live, be healthy” (non-inﬂected) → huuew
          (b) pewomek’ “I cook” → puuewomek’
          (c) lekwo’hl “it (a noise) ﬁlls the air” → luuekwo’hl6.6.2 Using iteratives
The examples in (69) show the use of iterative verbs to express repetition. Translations
in context may include “always”, “frequently”, “a lot”, and “off and on”, among some other
possibilities.

plural nouns (like pegerey “old women”); and nouns with -eg- that name things with
characteristic associations. Examples of the latter are hega’p’oh “cottonwood”, named af-
ter ha’p’oh “pitch”; and segep “coyote”, so named because coyotes are frequently in the
sepolah “prairie, open high country”. There are numerous animal and plant names with
this pattern.
Chapter 7Time reference with preverbsBasic time reference is expressed in Yurok by preverbs and preverb combinations. It is
also possible to use adverbs of time, words like chmeyaan “yesterday”, we’yk’oh “now”,
and ’owook “tomorrow”. These do not need to be pre-verbal, and they can stand on their
own without a verb. But they supplement the basic system of preverbs, to make time
reference more speciﬁc. The use of the most common preverbs for this purpose is the
subject of this chapter.","[90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"

12.6           Sonkook’ “I treat it (so)”
Grammatical description: transitive oo-class verb (3 sg -om’)Meaning and usage
This verb means “treat (it) in a speciﬁed way”, for example “well” (skuy’) or “badly” (keem’).
Sentences with sonkook’ usually express both the object that is treated in some way, and
the way in which it is treated. For example, in (218), kue ’yoch “the boat” is the object and
the question word kues “how?” expresses the manner. The passive, illustrated in (219),
is the most common form.
(218)     Kues ’elekw sonkohl kue ’yoch?
          “What on earth did they do with (lit. how did they treat) the boat?”                 YL 1951(219)     (a) Wee’eeet hewonee sonkee’.

Verbs with similar meanings
A generally similar verb is serrhlerperk’ “I act or behave (so)” (page 126), but this is
intransitive. There are also more speciﬁc verbs like keemkook’ “I treat it badly” (similar
in meaning to keem sonkook’) and skuykook’ “I treat it well” (like skuy’ sonkook’).","[157, 158, 159]"

Chapter 25Verbs of weather and timeThe verbs in this chapter refer to types of weather or events. They are called imper-
sonal because their subjects cannot be people, animals, etc. (a person cannot rain or be
windy); they only have 3 sg forms.
     One or two surprising features of impersonal verbs are illustrated in this chapter.
First, impersonal verbs have subjunctive forms may surprise learners, because they
seem to contain 1 sg endings (as if they meant “I am bad weather”, etc.). This is simply
a consequence of how subjunctives are formed. Second, as illustrated for ror’ “it snows”,
it is possible for an impersonal verb to have an impersonal passive.

25.1           Roo “be a (certain) time”
Grammatical description: intransitive non-inﬂected verb
Related verbs
      • rootah “sun shines (to somewhere)” (non-inﬂected)
      • rootep’ “it is a (particular) time”
Meaning and usage
As shown in (402a), roo can be used without a complement expressing what it is time
for. When a complement is present, as in (402b–c), a subjunctive verb is used.
(402)     (a) Kues keech roo?
              “What time is it?”                                                 YL 1951
          (b) Keech ’ee roo kee ’we-’e’gah.
              “It’s time for them to eat.”                                GT 2003 (YLCB)
          (c) Keech ’ee roo kue k’e-kepoyuerek’.
              “It is time for you to go swimming.”                               YL 1951The verb roo is a shorter form of non-inﬂected rootah (and inﬂected rootep’), which con-
veys a very similar meaning in examples like the following:
(403)     Kues rootah?
          “Where is the sun shining to?”                                     FS 1980 (PP)Traditionally, time measurement would have been by the angle of the sun and the length
of shadows. In effect, therefore, the sentence in (403) asks what time it is.

25.2       Snow, wind, and hail
The non-inﬂected verb sahksah in (404) refers to hail.
(404) Noohl ’o sahksah.
      “Then the hail comes.”                                                      FS 1980 (PP)Verbs that refer generally to wind and snow have a variety of forms. For wind, the basic
verb is rookws’ “it’s windy” (subjunctive ’we-rookwsek’, undocumented attributive rook-
wseen), which has a related non-inﬂected form rookw. These forms are illustrated in
(405).
(405)   (a) Neemee nuemee rook’ws ’o wee’eeet.
            “It’s not very windy here.”                                           FS 1980 (PP)
        (b) Neeko’hl ’we-rookwsek’ ’o wee’eeet.
            “It’s always windy here.”                                             FS 1980 (PP)
        (c) Neeko’hl ’we-rookw.
            “It’s always windy.”                                                  FS 1980 (PP)For snow, the basic verb is ror’ (subjunctive ’we-rorek’ and attributive roreen), illustrated
in (406).
(406)   (a) Ho ror’.

            “It’s snowing, it’s just now beginning to snow.”                   GT 2003 (YLCB)Perhaps surprisingly, this impersonal verb ror’ “it’s snowing” has an impersonal passive
form roree’ “there is snow”, illustrated in (407).
(407) Keech roree’.
      “It’s snowing.”                                                          GT 2003 (YLCB)

25.3         Verbs in -hl-
Given here are a set of verbs whose inﬂected forms have suﬃxes ending in -hl-. In most
cases inﬂected forms exist as well as non-inﬂected forms (vn). Attributives are given
even though mostly they are undocumented. All inﬂected forms below are 3 sg forms;

 person may do something on multiple occasions, or habitually; or multiple people may
 do something on the same occasion.",[90]

    Part IBasic grammar
 Chapter 1 The sounds of Yurok 1.1 Writing and pronunciation
 The principle of the basic sound, which linguists call the phoneme, underlies the writing
 of a language and its sound patterns. In every language, sounds can be arranged into a
 set of phonemes or basic sounds. Sometimes a phoneme is pronounced in only one
 way in a language; or a single phoneme may have two or more different pronunciations
 depending on its position in the word, or on nearby sounds.¹ In what follows, the writing
 system to be described is phonemic in the sense that each basic Yurok sound has a
 unique spelling (which may consist of more than one letter, such as ch, er, or eee).","[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"
" (21)      Pronouns as objects of prepositions

¹ Linguists use the term deixis as a cover term for such meaning distinctions. Deixis plays an important role
  in choices between different articles or pronouns.
² In addition, in Classical Yurok, what are called comitative forms in R. H. Robins’s book The Yurok language
  (1958; for the full reference see the Bibliography on page 299) were used: neka’ahl “to me”, nekaanohl “to us”,
  and kela’ahl “to you”. These forms have not yet been documented in Modern Yurok.

ten, but they are appropriate when the speaker wishes to imply a contrast with someone
else. Examples are in (22–23). In (22), the contrastive pronouns are subjects.
(22)    Contrastive pronouns used as subjects
        (a) Nekee’ nahchesek’.
            “I gave it to her.”                                               AF 2001 (LJC)

in (23a), the speaker implies that it is someone else’s ﬁshing place.
(23)    Contrastive pronouns used as non-subjects
        (a) Mos kelee’ k’-ekwol.
            “It is not your ﬁshing place.”                                   FS 1951 (RHR)

        (d) Kues soo hesem’, Nekee’ ’ne-tektoh?
            “Why do you think, ‘This is my log’?”                            FS 1951 (RHR)   Finally, Table 4.1 includes two objective pronouns nekach and kelach. These are
used when the object of a verb is “me” or “you (sg)” and the verb has a third-person
subject. Given in (24) are two examples with ordinary transitive verbs and the objective
pronoun kelach “you (sg)”.
(24)    Examples of objective kelach “you (sg)”
        (a) To’ hes kelach skewok kue mewasegoh?
            “Do the boys like you?”                                                 YL 1951
        (b) Yo’ kelach ’o noo’rep’.
            “He followed you there.”                                                YL 1951Given in (25) are examples with objective nekach “me” and bipersonal verbs.

to”.
(26)    Nekach ho kweryerw’.
        “Someone whistled to me.”                                               FS 1980 (PP)    The singular pronouns nek “I” and kel’ “you (sg)” are not used as the objects of verbs
with third-person subjects. As seen in (27), however, plural pronouns like nekah “we,
us” are used in this context.
(27)    Yo’hlkoh nekah sermeryerwery.
        “They will kill us.”                                                          YL 1951
4.1.2 Demonstrative pronouns
Demonstrative pronouns refer either to animals, things, or places (like English it, that,
this, here, there), or to people other than the speaker or addressee (like English he, she,
they). Yurok has an elaborate system of demonstrative pronouns in comparison with
English; here only the main pronouns that can be used for people will be mentioned.
These are summarized in Table 4.2.                                       singular         plural                           proximal    wo’ or wo’oot    wo’hlkoh
                            neutral    yo’ or yo’oot    yo’hlkoh                      Table 4.2: Selected demonstrative pronounsIn the singular column, wo’ and yo’ are more common short forms of wo’oot and yo’oot,
respectively, but the short and long forms have the same basic meaning.
    The difference between the proximal and neutral forms is as follows. Proximal
forms refer to someone (or something) who is nearby, or relatively close, especially if
contrasted with someone (or something) farther away. Neutral forms refer to someone
(or something) that is absent or farther away, or in contexts when no particular distance
is implied. Because neutral forms are used when no particular distance is implied, they
are far more common; they are used for “he, she, him, her, they, them” in most instances.
    Examples of proximal demonstratives in sentences are in (28).
(28)    Proximal demonstrative examples
        (a) Wo’ tue’ skewok kee k’e-tegerew.
             “He (this person) wants to talk to you.”                           JJ 2007 (LC)
        (b) Mos wo’oot, nek wee’ serrhl.
             “Not him (this person), I did it.”                                 AF 2001 (JB)Examples of neutral demonstratives in sentences are in (29).

20.10         Nekek’ “I put it (in a certain place)”
Grammatical description: transitive e-class verbMeaning and usage
This is the ordinary verb to express the meaning “put” or “place”. It is typically used with
an expressed (or questioned) location where something is put. Expressions associated
with locations are underlined in (308): kue ’lahpsew “the plate” in (308a), pa’aahl “water”
in (308b), wee’ “here” in (308c), and kues “where?” in (308d).
(308)   (a) Kue ’lahpsew nek’ kue nepuy.
            “He put the salmon on the plate.”                                   FS 1951 (RHR)
        (b) Pa’aahl nekue’ kue ’yoch.
            “The boat was put in the water.”                                   GT 2003 (YLCB)
        (c) Wee’ nek’es kue rego’oh.
            “Put the feather here.”                                               AF 2002 (JB)
        (d) Kues nekem’?
            “Where did you put it?”                                            GT 2003 (YLCB)It is not necessary to introduce the location with a preverb (such as ’o): kue ’lahpsew nek’
in (308a) means “he put it on the plate”, and pa’aahl nekue’ in (308b) means “it was put
in the water”.
     Two special combinations are shown in (309–310). The combination kes nekek’ “I
put it down” as in (309) can be used to mean “I misplaced it”.
(309) Keech kes nekek’.
      “I misplaced it.”                                                               JVP (YD)As in (310), skelee nekek’ or hlkelee nekek’ “I put it on the ground” can just mean “I put
it down”.
(310) Cho’ nuemee skuy’ soo skelee nekem’.
      “Put the spear down carefully.”                                             FS 1951 (YL)
Verbs with similar meanings
The most common verb whose meaning is close to nekek’ is the verb lootek’ “I throw it,
I toss it, I put it (somewhere) loosely’ (page 212). The basic difference between these
two verbs is that nekek’ implies relatively precise placement, as when you are holding
something until it is ﬁnally in place, while lootek’ implies loss of contact and less preci-
sion in the location expressed. Another verb with a similar meaning is leketek’ “I pick it
up, I put it somewhere’, but this verb does not require a location to be expressed.","[247, 248]"

tween clauses. This is not common, but in this construction the cho’ clause apparently
expresses near-simultaneity. In the examples in (116), the clause with cho’ is underlined.",[110]
"10.1.1        Descriptive sentences
In English, expressions like I am tall, the boat is long, and my children are good contain
forms of the verb be and an adjective. But because Yurok has no adjectives, it ordinarily
uses verbs to express meanings like the ones expressed by be + an adjective in English.
Many Yurok verbs describe properties; sentences with such verbs can be called descrip-
tive sentences. Examples are in (177).
(177)   (a) Noorew’ kue chegemem.
            “The hummingbird is pretty.”                                      GM 2004 (AG)
        (b) Yo’ sega’agey’.
            “She is rich.”                                                   GT 2003 (YLCB)
        (c) Keech teytesek’, keech hlmeyowok’.
            “I am angry, I am mean.”                                            FS 1980 (PP)The translations given show that in these examples a Yurok verb is equivalent to an
English be + adjective construction.",[130]
