"It is notable that kuwá does not co-occur with either of the 'nominalized'
negation particles küru ri or kö η, suggesting that these are unable to
license a negative polarity item.

as an answer to a question and meaning 'never'. Or it can be freely
placed in the clause including at the end of the clause, as in the following
examples.(41)     @     tn-äwi    @ β                                  @       kûrù          @

                      Modals and negationThis chapter discusses a group of words which have similar syntax, and
express modality and affirmation/negation:        ra'        expressing affirmation, completion (and perhaps
                        also necessity)
        wà         possibility
        kpe        non possibility
        kú         non-past negation
        küru       past negationThese words are found 'bare' and also in combination with the definite
article n. The structure with π is discussed in detail in the Focus chapter
(19.11).
17.1. ra : affirmation, certaintyThe word ra comes at the end of the sentence. The sentence can be
interpreted as past or future (depending on the verb, uninflected or
inflected respectively). The sentence cannot have a present interpretation,
even if the verb is inflected (nonpast). This has the consequence that if ra'
is combined with an inflected (nonpast) verb, the sentence can only have a
future interpretation,
    ra has three meanings:
  (a) ra affirms an eventuality, perhaps with some sense of personal
  endorsement that it has happened or will happen, thus with some kind
  of evidential force.
  (b) ra' functions as a modal of necessity: it can be used to indicate that
  something must take place.
  (c) ra' is a 'generic completive' indicating the completion of an
  eventuality.
Meanings (a) and (b) are clearly related, and are the 'modal' meanings of
ra. These meanings differentiate it as an affirmative form from negative
ku or kuru, and as a necessity form from possibility wà. Meaning (c) is
more like an aspectual meaning, forcing a perfective interpretation on a
clause. This might explain why ra' is not found in a sentence with a
present tense intepretation because the present is always imperfective in
452       Modals and negation
Ma'di. In its completive meaning it can act as a generic substitute for
other completive particles which are specifically selected by verbs
(18.2.2.1). We gloss ra' as AFF for 'affirmative' and we translate it into
English as 'certainly' or 'definitely' or 'really' or sometimes by
stressing part of the sentence.
    Crazzarola (1960: 97) describes the Logbara cognate ra' as expressing
definiteness or determination, the idea that an action has actually taken
place, or that a state really exists or will have to take place.' Djuruni
(1983: 87) translates Logbara ra into French as 'effectivement'.
17.1.1.      ré as an         'affirmative'The affirmative effect of ra' can be seen in the following sentence where it
is put in contrast to kûrù (past negation).(1)         ësu      i-d^ë              ra       ole   i-d^ë         kûrù
             find   2s-buy     AFF or 2s-buy          NEG(P)
             'whether you have paid or you have not paid for it'   Given the affirmative force of ra, it is worth noting that ra' can come at
the end of a sentence which begins with conditional dzo.(2)         djò      Spi         ë-mù                   ra       ko-vu               àtfi

             'If Opi definitely comes let him light a fire.'(3)         djo      opi         k-é-mú                ra      kò-νδ              àtfi

             (a)   'Should Opi definitely come, let him light a fire.'
             (b)   'Should Opi come, he should light a fire.'(4)         d$3    Spi        kò-sl              dio    ra      pi          fó     má       ni

            (b) 'Should Opi definitely build a house (you should) tell me.'","[468, 469, 470]"
"
17.4. Negation: ku (nonpast) and küru (past)'Descriptive negation' with ku or küru is the basic kind of negation,
where the sentence states that something did not happen, is not happening,
or will not happen. Descriptive negation is achieved by placing ku or küru
at the end of the sentence. The negation particles also have focus-related
behaviour, discussed in the focus chapter: icü can be used to contrastively
negate a constituent of the sentence (19.10.2); both kü and küru combine
with η to form freely placed adverbials (19.11). Phonologically kü fits a
general pattern in Nilo-Saharan where a negative word often has the
phonological structure [k]+vowel (Bender 2000: 65).",[484]
"
19.11.1.1. Scope over the containing clauseWhen they are in final position, the negative particles kö and kûrù co-
occur only with an uninfected verb. When they are combined with ri this
is no longer the case. The negative particles retain their tenses but now
they agree with the tense of the verb, so that kö ri co-occurs with the
inflected verb (both nonpast) and kûrù ή co-occurs with the uninflected
verb (both past).
    kö ri can license a negative polarity item in the main clause.(246)   kuwa pi       zâ       kü         π     pi ?1
        never 2s      pass     NEG(N) DEF        2S FOC
         'The one who will never pass is you.' (more specific)(247)   kuwa pi         zä       kü             pi ?1
        never 2S        pass     NEG(N)          2s FOC
         'It is you who will never pass.' (less specific)
586     Focus and information structure    drònà is a free adverbial which expresses a past habitual. It can shift
the temporal reference point of a sentence into the past whether it is a free
adverbial or it is embedded under ri. Thus the following sentence is
inflected but interpreted as past. (248) drònà    η     Spi    k-ad^l-â                          m

20.3.3.4.        Úákìà is a more disparaging way of saying 'no' used to devalue the worth
of a person or a proposal. Unlike the others, this word is only found in
negative statements (with negation) or yes-no questions, and mostly in
nonverbal predications.(208)   kìà        , opi      ?1         ku

20.3.3.5.     ani ánl kuani ánl kö literally means 'not like it'. At the beginning of a sentence it
can be interpreted as 'no'. It can be used only in a nonpast sentence (as
we would expect from the use of nonpast negation ku).

"2.8.   Tense and aspect
The distinction between inflected and uninflected verbs, and between the
negation particles kö and kuru, is a distinction in tense: between nonpast
and past respectively. In other descriptions of Central Sudanic languages,
this distinction has been characterised as a distinction in aspect, but we do
not consider this correct for Ma'di. A non-past clause is sometimes
ambiguous between a present and a future interpretation, but in general a
present interpretation is taken as the default interpretation unless a future
interpretation is forced by the presence of some other element in the
clause, not necessarily having any specifically future meaning, such as the
affirmative modal ra, a future adverbial, etc. Present tense correlates with
imperfective aspect, progressive or habitual. Nonpast (past and future)
tense correlates with perfective aspect. Habitual and progressive can be
expressed in past or future sentences by periphrastic means. Non-verbal
clauses are nonpast by default. It is possible to express past states
periphrastically by embedding the non-verbal clause under a verb which
shifts the clause into the past.",[35]

20.4. Implicatures of certain questioning strategies20.4.1.    A satirical question with final ηThe particle π is used to give an implication of mockery on the part of the

19.11 Focus and Modals/negation/adverbial + ri
Modals, negation particles and fixed adverbials normally appear 'bare' at
the end of the clause. However, they can also be combined with ii to give
for example ra ri and then are treated like freely placed adverbials. They
are found only in sentences with focus on an argument. Verbal focus,
discussed in 19.12, will not license these forms. The particle + ri
construction functions like some of the other free adverbials such as êsu
in that it takes a clause which is complete, and fully interpreted, and then
'relocates' it. Thus there are free adverbials (and drònà π) which take a
clause and shift its temporal reference point. What the nominalized
modals and negation seem to do is something similar. Thus for example
kü ri takes a full affirmative clause with a focused argument, and then
says that for the focused argument the clause is not the case, or rá π says
of the focused argument that the clause is certainly true.(232)                   ópí         k-è-mù          m

"We note that Ngiti has several different kinds of augmentative suffix,
which express different kinds of bigness (Lojenga 1994:165). This is not
the case in Ma'di.
   There are two other morphemes gó which follow nouns, and which
may or may not be related to this augmentative. As the first of these, gó is
used in epithets (for both genders) in a noun phrase ending with a final
low determiner. On its own it tends to have a positive meaning: ópí gó*
'mighty Opi', izi gó^ 'the powerful woman'. Reduplicated it tends to
have a negative meaning eg. ópí gó gó' 'the menacing Opi'. As the
second of these, gó expresses maleness when attached to a noun, deriving
màcfi-gó  'male Ma'di', ìndri-gó 'he-goat'. It has a variant lógó found
only in á?ú-lógó 'cock' and fòro-lógó 'male tilapia'.",[119]
"The demonstrative dì 'this' may be used for sentential emphasis when
it is sentence final. When used this way it takes a high floating tone at the
end, the type used in questions. It is used to insist on a point of view, or to
stress the urgency of the particular moment; the implicatures (in brackets
in the gloss) are there only when dì is present.(158)       ma     /o     ßi      mu     kü            dì

20.2.6.     adu si in final positionThe final negative particle can be followed by the question phrase àdù sì

"It is worth noting that the same negative particle ku is found with both
verbal and non-verbal predicates in Ma'di. Djuruni (1983: 104) says that
this is not the case in Logbara, where jó is found with nonverbal
predicates and ko with verbal predicates.
    kûrù cannot negate a non-verbal predicate; this is as we would expect
as non-verbal predicates are interpreted as nonpast.

8.4.2. Aspect8.4.2.1.        Inflected verbs are normally imperfective if present and
                perfective if futureA verb with a low inflectional prefix and hence with nonpast tense can be
interpreted either as imperfective or as perfective. The interpretation of the
nonpast verb as imperfective correlates with the interpretation of the verb
as specifically present. The interpretation of the nonpast verb as perfective
correlates with the interpretation of the verb as specifically future. This
means that future can be differentiated from present by the presence of
the perfective affirmative particle ra which affirms the completion of an
action (and can be used with either past or nonpast verbs).
   A sentence with a verb interpreted as imperfective can in principle be
interpreted as either progressive or habitual. If a verb is inherently
imperfective, then it is imperfective also in the future.",[186]
"   There is no negative quantifier (ie. equivalent to English 'no' in 'no
person'). The meaning of 'no-one' is expressed periphrastically, using zi,
the nonspecific indefinite determiner.

14.4.6.     Two other quantifying expressionsTwo other expressions can be used to indicate that there are too many of
an entity to be counted. One is kàre àkó, a postposition phrase made up
of kàre 'place' + àkó 'without', and is generally sentence-final.(204)        fía    ε-vu               kàre àkó

18.2.5.2 Reduplicated ra or pi: the adverbials ra ra and pi piIt is particularly interesting that the affirmative modal ra can be
reduplicated. The following shows (253) a two-sentence combination with
the second sentence ending in rá, and then (254) a two-clause
combination with the second sentence ending in ra ra.",[538]
"
7.5.2.2.        Constituents which may be 'too far from the verb' and which
                cannot terminate the verbThe word áni cannot terminate the verb; we think it may be external to the
clause, because it follows affirmative ra. Note that if ra is present it will
terminate the verb.(86)*      jú      mü             ani

affect the tense interpretation of a sentence when the affirmative modal ra
is reduplicated.
    As a footnote to this section we note that Tucker (1940: 216) says that
in Ma'di, initial o- is associated with plural action. We have no evidence
for this; it may be an error based on the acoustic similarity between the
back vowels in Ma'di. We note however that Ngiti has a cognate prefix u-
for plural action (Lojenga 1994: 283).","[96, 97]"

5.3.2.3. Some further implications with the passive interpretationWhen the verb is uninflected and the sentence with rü also contains
affirmative ra and thus the sentence affirms a past event, two more precise
interpretations become available, in addition to the basic interpretation.(107)   idi                5-te      rü      ra
         peanut butter     3-lick    REFL AFF
         'The peanut butter has certainly been licked.'
         Interpreted as (a) an indirect accusation that someone has been
         licking the peanut butter, or (b) that we have had enough of the
        peanut butter.(108)   εή       rü          ra
        hear REFL            AFF
         'It has certainly been heard.'
        Interpreted as (a) there were rumours about it, or (b) we have
        heard and understood it and there is no need to go on about it.
The interpretations (a) point to a change affecting the subject/patient but
with an implication that the change is not total; the butter has been licked
at rather than licked away, and the information has been partially heard
(rumoured) rather than fully heard. Interpretation (b) emphasizes the state
of the implied agent or experiencer, and suggests plenitude: the subject
has had enough butter, or has heard enough and doesn't want to hear any
94      Verbs
more; this reading arises even when the overt subject is focused (109).
   These meanings require the use of the affirmative/necessity modal ra.
Without ra the basic meaning is available, but not the extra implications.

           'It is fish that has been eaten of all the things.'
           Interpreted as (a) it is fish that has been tampered with, or (b) it
           is fish that we've had enough of eating.

           'It is fish that has been eaten of all the things.'
           No further interpretation that fish has been tampered with or that
           we've had enough of it.","[109, 110]"

8.4.1.3. Disambiguating non-past: forcing a future interpretation
It is possible to force a future interpretation in one of two basic ways. The
verb can be subordinated under a verb such as mu (16.6) or ko (16.8). Or
ra or another grammatical word can be added to the sentence.
    The addition of ra to a nonpast sentence forces a future reading.(48)     má       gbàndà           pä
         IS      cassava     (N)-eat
         Ί eat cassava.' Ί am eating cassava.'(49)     má      gbánda           pä         rá
         IS      cassava        (N)-eat      AFF
         Ί will certainly eat cassava.'(50)     ko mû      dzubà     gá
         3-N-go Juba       LOC
         (a) 'He is going to Juba.'
         (b) 'He is just about to set off for Juba. '(51)     ko mû      d3ubà    gá         rá
         3-N-go Juba        LOC AFF
         'He will certainly go to Juba.'   ra is incompatible with a present tense interpretation of a sentence. It is
however compatible with both a past and a future interpretation, rá
apparently adds a range of (related) meanings to a sentence:
(a) It affirms an eventuality (perhaps with some sense of personal
    endorsement that it has happened or will happen).
(b) It perhaps functions as a modal of necessity: it can be used to indicate
     that something must take place.
(c) It is a 'generic completive' indicating the completion of an
    eventuality.
We might see the incompatibility between ra and the present as arising
from any of these meanings. Perhaps the affirmative force of rá is
                                                           Interpretation   167redundant in the present because the 'affirmativity' of the present comes
from its happening right now. Similarly the modal force might be
redundant if something actually is happening right now. It might also be
that the completive meaning of ra is incompatible with the imperfectivity
of the present in Ma'di. Note that ra does not specifically code future;
thus it can be used in past sentences as well as non-past sentences.(52)     ma      fii      gbándá      ra
         IS     taste     cassava     AFF
         Ί certainly tasted cassava.'","[182, 183]"

17.2.4.   Tucker on wàTucker says that wà is attached to the verb in Lokai and separated in
Panderiki (ie. the 'Burulo dialect). We have found no evidence for
attachment to the verb in any dialect. It may be that Tucker is
reinterpreting the fact that Lokai differs from 'Burulo in that it can have
object-verb order, where the verb is capable of being followed
immediately by wà.
464    Modals and negation17.3. kpe: non-possibility
kpe appears at the end of the sentence and is found with all tenses, kpe is
the negative counterpart of wà and expresses non-possibility. The relation
between kpe and wà is illustrated below.(65)            fî-e-kè-â              má         ni    wà   òlè   kpe
          2S-(N)-VE-give-OBJ     is    BEN PS        or            NPS
          (a) 'Can you give me some or not?'
          (b) 'Are you able to give me some or not?'","[481, 482]"
"
2.9.   Modality
The core modals are sentence-final words which can alternatively be
nominalized by combining them with the determiner π which allows them
to be freely placed within the sentence. The core modals are wà which
expresses possibility, kpe which expresses non-possibility, and ra which
expresses a range of meanings including necessity and affirmation. The
negation particles are very similar in their syntax to the modals.(30)    δ-sl        d3o               wà
         3-build house             PS
         'He was able to build a house.'(31)    má     pi      tè             kpe
        IS     2S      (N)-wait      NPS
        Ί can't wait for you.'
20     An overview of Ma'diThe modal ra affirms the proposition expressed by the sentence. We
consider it to be a kind of necessity modal. It appears to be inherently
perfective, and is thus not compatible with a present tense interpretation of
a sentence which is always imperfective in Ma'di. Hence ra can be used
to force a future reading on a nonpast sentence as in (35).(32)      má       mû     ë6Ù       gá
           IS      go     work     LOC
           Ί had gone to work.' (that's why you didn't get me)(33)      má       mû     ëBÙ      gá     ra
           IS      go     work     LOC    AFF
           Ί did go to work.' (I was certainly there)(34)      má      mu      efitì    gá      οδό
           IS      N-go work     LOC tomorrow
           Ί will go to work tomorrow.'(35)      má      mû      ëBÙ      gá             ra
           IS     N-go work        LOC           AFF
           Ί will go to work.' (I will certainly be there)2.10. NegationThe verb is negated by a sentence-final negation word kü or küru; the
verb must be uninflected and tense is expressed by the choice of negation
word (7,8). The negation words have a syntax similar to the core modals;
they are either fixed in final position or can be nominalized by adding the
determiner π and are then freely placed within the clause, negating
specific constituents of the sentence. Note that this kind of negation is
compatible with an inflected verb.(36)      kü         η        má   eßl     pä
           NEG(N) DEF Is           fish N-eat
           'The one that I don't eat is fish.'","[35, 36]"
"   A verb negated with the past negation particle küru (7) or the nonpast
negation particle kü (8). In both cases the verb has the syntax and
morphology of an uninflected verb.(7)      m-äwi           (I3ÓÜ                 küru
          lS-open    door                      NEG(P)
          Ί did not open the door.'(8)      m-äwi           d$ótl                 kü
         lS-open   door           NEG(N)
         (a) Ί won't open the door.'
         (b) Ί don't open doors.'
         (c) Ί am not opening the door.'
    The uninflected verb cannot be the final word in a sentence; we say in
this grammar that it must be 'terminated' by being followed by some
appropriate element.
                                            Arguments: subject and object   15(9)*    O-                            pa

"The negation particle ku can follow a sentence ending on a negation
particle or a modal. It is possibly the modal or negation itself which is
being contrastively negated here.",[596]
"
8.4.3. The restriction against negation of an inflected verbThe nonpast negation particle kü might be expected to negate the nonpast
inflected verb. In fact it cannot do so.(86)*   ma        gbánda      pa                           kü
         IS       cassava    (N)-eat                   NEG(N)
         Ί am not eating cassava.'kü can negate only an uninflected verb.(87)    ma                    pà          gbánda           kü
         IS                  eat          cassava      NEG(N)
         Ί am not eating cassava.'kü can end a sentence with an inflected verb, but it does not negate the
verb in this type of sentence; it contrastively negates the whole clause.(88)    má          gbánda              pä                          kü
        IS          cassava             (N)-eat                     NEG(N)
        'It is not that I am eating cassava...' (but...)   The past negation particle küru does not combine with an inflected
verb, as expected: it is not clear what its interpretation would be if
grammatical.
174     The inflected verb(89)*     ma          gbándá          Ρ*                      kuru
          IS          cassava          (N)-eat                NEG(P)   Djuruni (1983: 78) relates this to evidentiality, suggesting that in the
similar situation of Logbara the inflected verb implies that the eventuality
must be confirmable by one of the interlocutors, and hence is
incompatible with negation.","[189, 190]"
"The unmarked interpretation is that the event has happened once before;
multiple previous occurrences can be indicated by using the iterative ö-
prefix on the verb. Temporal modifiers can be used in combination with
gbù only if they are generic rather than referring to a specific time.(188)    ε-tfa          di?a gbu              mini      εζε "" TÍ
         (3)-VE-reach here once before morning early SPEC FOC
          'She has been here before early in the morning.'(189)* ε-tfá          di?â gbù               tébè               *    ?ì

        'She has been here (before) earlier in the day of the speech
       event.'
18.2.4.3 isä 'only', 'without'isa expresses a meaning that something is absent without specifying what
it is; the addressee must fill in the missing portion, isa is not associated
with any particular verb, unlike the 'negative completion' particles
discussed in 18.2.4.1. It is always sentence-final.

          (c) Ί ate these potatoes for no apparent reason.'(ie. I was not

          Ί saw only one person.'
18.2.4.4 tro 'in addition'The fixed adverbial tro adds the meaning of 'in addition' to the sentence.
The eventuality represented by the sentence is interpreted as the result of
the subject's staying around to do it, or as its being something additional
or incidental to some other eventuality. Thus in the following example, I
stayed around long enough to taste the mango, or tasting the mango was
one of the things that I did there though not the primary thing.(195)    má          BÌ           màqgà                 li               trò

that building a house was not his main intention; he may perhaps have
gone to the village for a holiday (principal aim) but built a house as well
(incidental action); or he stayed long enough to build the house.(196)   o-sl               dso         π        tro

660       LexiconThe words for sister and brother can be extended to mean 'step-sister'
and 'step-brother'. They are shortened versions of long descriptive terms
such as ma"" luku ?à qgwá"" ?ì 'my father's co-wife's son' and they are
used to make the distant relations seem closer and more familial. The
word for first born male twin ópi is also the word for 'chief' (male or
female). The derived female form ópià means first born female twin. The
word for second born twin εremugó is similar (with the exception of the
final vowel) to érémúgó the word for 'blacksmith' or 'artisan'. Negative
associations hold for érémúgó ; blacksmiths are traditionally regarded as
a lazy bunch who spend their time in sheds while the rest are busy toiling
the fields or setting animal traps. The female form mùjàà is possibly
related to the male form via muje 'leftover of melted iron'. There are no
words for triplets or larger sets of siblings.","[677, 678]"

example, gloss (242a) treats the word as an adjective and thus permits the

the definite article.

17.4.1. Negation and tense
In descriptive negation, the verb is always uninflected, never inflected. The
uninflected vs. inflected distinction normally expresses tense on the verb;
in descriptive negation, the tense is expressed instead by the negation
particle. Djuruni (1983: 91) proposes a functional explanation of why
descriptive negation in Logbara takes the 'past tense' syntax, which is
that the past is like negation in that they both involve 'non-presence'.
Some descriptions of Central Sudanic languages propose, in our view
incorrectly, that the distinction between kü and küru or cognates is one of
aspect rather than tense, parallel to a claim made in these descriptions that
object-verb order distinguishes aspect rather than tense (8.4.2.4).
17.4.1.1.    ku : nonpast
¿¿»combines with an uninflected verb, and expresses nonpast (present or
future) tense. The combination of the uninflected verb with ku appears to
be equivalent to the inflected verb in that it expresses nonpast, either

Fixed final adverbials have a syntax similar to the modal and negation
particles. They tend to be sentence-final, can be 'nominalized' with n, can
be left-dislocated, and sometimes show restrictions in combination with
past or nonpast verbs. Some of the fixed final adverbials are selected by
specific verbs, while others can be combined with any verb. Adverbials
which are selected by specific verbs often express the completion or
exhaustion of the action. Some of the adverbials are homophonous with
singular adjectives (6.6.2), such as péléré, but this is not true of all the
completion adverbials. Thus pi for example is only an adverbial.
   Fixed final adverbials are among the words characteristically found at
the end of the sentence.

"2.16. Supra-sentential final elements
Some constituents must be final but in addition seem to stand outside or
above the sentence, perhaps as higher predicates taking the sentence as an
argument. They can take scope over the sentence as a whole and do not
appear to have any special relation with any particular component of the
sentence. We call them supra-sentential final elements. Thus for example
as discussed in 2.10 the negation particle ¿Jean function both as a fixed
final sentential element where it negates the verb and as a supra-sentential
final element where it contrastively negates the clause or one of its
focused subconstituents in comparison with another clause.

"The negation particle kûrù is normally used to negate the verb to give a
sentence with a past interpretation. Here it has a more restricted use. With
1ε meaning 'want', kûrù can only be interpreted as contrastive sentential
negation rather than verbal negation.(41)     má            1ε         mü-kä                         kûrù

but with some slightly odd interpretations which might imply that kûrù is
actually negating something other than the verb.

         (b)      Ί did not know Opi.' (did not know his true character)    We now consider another set of verbs which show anomalous tense
behaviour. The verbs π 'sit', de if interpreted as 'lie', and wô 'kneel' all
have uninflected forms which unexpectedly have present interpretations.
As for the verbs discussed in the previous section, we suggest that the
verb is coded for past but there is an implicature that the state continues
into the present. Thus the past interpretation is of an action, and the
present interpretation of a state resulting from the action which has
already happened.(43)     opi          δ-wo           vùru

         (b) 'Opi is kneeling down.' (stationary, not moving into a
             kneeling position)

expressing direction or location, or the verbs are focused.(44)     opi          o-n            kómi     drì

"    As (88) and (89) show, dri has two peculiarities when it is itself
inflected. First, the inflected form of the verb can be interpreted as past;
this is in fact the typical way of expressing past sequence in a narrative.
Second, the inflected forms of the verb, third person and indefinite, have
non-standard pronominale, with kádri rather than the expected kódrì in
the third person and ádri rather than the expected adrì dri in the
                                         Grammatical verbs which express sequence   425indefinite. We suggest that the morphological peculiarities of the
pronouns can be resolved by suggesting that the inflected form of drì is
actually ádñ, thus a suppletion rather than a prefixing of the low tone.
Thus the third person would have kó-ádi which would resolve to kàdrì,
and the indefinite might result from adding a high tone prefix to ádn.
   When sentences with inflected drì end in ra or kü or kûrù and a high
tone, a kind of conditional warning meaning emerges. The negation
particles are contrastive (19.10.2, 19.10.3.1). The high tone is probably
the yes-no question morpheme (20.3.1.1).(90)      ká      dn       bìlò           azi             ra

uninflected verb.(170)   j- n i                           màdî                  dì         òté        ä

20.3.1.3.     Final ámThe word am can be added to the end of a sentence finally to turn it into a
question, asking why the action was not undertaken, or to make a
suggestion. This is a polite strategy. There is no rising intonation, and am
must be sentence-final. Note that it does not terminate the verb,
suggesting that it is possibly external to the sentence (7.5).(172)   jû       dü         iza          zi            kü            ám

homophone ám which is a third person pronoun with various uses (cf. its

weakened probability, jà possibly functions to affirm, similarly to ra, with
a meaning of 'is it the case that..?'. It is like a gambit, used in shouting
especially where there is a distance between the speakers. Note that there
is no high tone at the end, although it is a yes-no question, jà cannot
terminate an uninflected verb.(175)    ma /<?       pi     mu      ra   jà

1.6.   Ma'di in print and on the radioPrinted material in Ma'di is scarce and where there is any it is hard to
come by. Possibly the only general published works in Ma'di are
missionary publications such as the translation of the New Testament, and
prayer and song booklets by the Catholic missionaries. We have heard
that the missions of Arua diocese have some publications in Ma'di. The
Ma'di Ethnic and Heritage Welfare Association in Britain publishes a
quarterly bilingual (English and Ma'di) paper called Ma'di Lelego. The
texts we include at the end of this grammar were collected on behalf of
this association, which we thank. We can best represent the situation of
Ma'di on the radio by saying that in Spring 1998, Radio Uganda made
the following regular broadcasts in Ma'di (all programmes except
'Listeners' Favorite' last 15 minutes). (Daily) News in Ma'di, Religious
Program, Veterans' Assistance Board (Program for laid off soldiers),
Talk Show (general topic), Ma'di Guest, Ma'di Traditional Music,
Calling Farmers, Women's Program, Family Life Education, Health
Program, Listeners' Favorite (Greetings).
6    Introduction
1.6.1. Orthography A standard orthography was adopted following the recommendations of
 the Rejaf Language Conference of 1928. The policy then was to admit
 representative languages to be taught in schools. From the Eastern
 Sudanic languages were chosen Zande, Mora, Ma'di, Kreish and Ndogo
 (Tucker 1940:36). The rest of the languages were left to die. Government
 textbooks were supposed to be issued in these languages to be used in the
 schools. Subsequently Sir James Robertson, who succeded Sir Douglas
 Newbold as the Civil Secretary, reversed in 1946 the policy of his
predecessor which hitherto regarded South Sudan as a different social
 and political entity from Northern Sudan. This reversal saw the last
 governmental attempt to develop orthographies for the languages of the
 South Sudan, as the North has been hostile to them and has preferred the
promotion of Arabic. From around 1987 The Summer Institute of
Linguistics (SIL) started work on the orthography of the language
culminating in the production of a primer in 1992; SIL member Kilpatrick
(1985) also has suggestions for an orthography.
    The standard orthography for Ma'di omits tones and uses the five
vowels (a, e, i, o, u), thus ignoring ATR distinctions in the vowels. The
SEL suggestion for ATR differentiation is to place a dot below a vowel (a
e i o or u) to mark it as +ATR; without a dot the vowel is -ATR.
Kilpatrick suggests as an alternative placing a colon before the word with
+ATR vowels. In this grammar, following Lojenga 1994, we use different
symbols for +ATR vowels (λ e i o u) and -ATR (a ε i ο υ) vowels. This
is our only deviation from the IPA symbols we otherwise use, and we do
this for visual clarity.
    For the tones, the SIL practice is as follows: Low vowels are marked
with a tilde over the vowel, high vowels with an acute accent, and mid
vowels are not marked with a diacritic. Kilpatrick suggests additionally
marking mid vowels with a circumflex or umlaut. In this grammar we
mark low vowels with a grave accent (à), mid vowels with a macron (ä),
and high vowels with an acute accent (á).
    Glottal stops are indicated in the standard orthography by an
apostrophe, as in 'a for ?a 'stomach'. Implosive ('preglottalized')
consonants are marked in the standard orthography by putting an
apostrophe before the consonant, as 'ba, for fia 'to put; home'. Hence
the language name màdi is written Ma'di. The palatal nasal [p] is written
ny, hence pä is written nya. These orthographic practices are adopted also
by the SIL. We use IPA symbols for all consonants in this grammar.

There are two main dialects of Ma'di; the Northern and the Southern
dialects, which have subdivisions within them. This is a probable
breakdown of dialects:
                                   Ma'di
          Southern                           Northern ('Burulo)

Figure 1. Dialects of Ma'di
8    IntroductionThe dialects are mutually intelligible (we have witnessed conversations in
which a mixed group of 'Burulo, Lokai and Ugandan Ma'di speakers
each speak in their own dialect). This is a grammar of Lokai Ma'di; we
occasionally comment on differences between Lokai and 'Burulo or
Ugandan Ma'di.","[21, 22, 23, 24]"
"1.8.     Previous research relating to Ma'diThe earliest published work on Ma'di is probably Molinaro (1925). The
major surveys of Tucker (1940) and Tucker and Bryan (1966) include
sections on Ma'di. There are dictionaries for Ma'di by Bilbao and
Ferrazin (nd), Ferrazin (1996), and Blackings (2000). Linguistic work on
Ma'di phonetics and phonology includes Andersen (1986), Demolin and
Goyvaerts (1986) and Kilpatrick (1985). Linguistic work on Ma'di
syntax includes Andersen and Goyvaerts (1986), Blackings (1988),
Watson (1997) and Andersen (1998). Surveys which include material on
Ma'di include Greenberg (1966), Demolin (1988), Heine and Nurse
(2000). Work on other Central Sudanic languages which we have found
useful includes Andersen (1984, 1987), and Vallaeys (1991, and nd).
Crazzarola (1960) is titled A study of the Logbara (Ma'di) language.
Grammar and vocabulary but despite the title is not a grammar of
Ma'di; Logbara is a distinct but quite closely related language within the
                                      Previous research relating to Ma 'di   11Moru-Ma'di family. Djuruni (1983) is a useful study of Logbara by a
native speaker (and critical of Crazzarola). Lojenga's (1994) grammar of
Ngiti is the only detailed previous grammar of a Central Sudanic
language; we have found this grammar very useful and make occasional
comparisons with Ngiti where they seem relevant.

                      An overview of Ma'di2.1.   Sound structurePoints of note about Ma'di consonants are that there are many
secondarily and doubly articulated consonants and there are implosi ves.
There is little allophonic variation. Vowels show Advanced Tongue Root
harmony. There are three tones: high, mid and low. Some morphemes
consist just of floating tones. Vowel and tone deletion takes place, and
may result in the surface concealment of grammatical morphemes such as
pronominals and inflection. Syllables are CV or V. There are few
restrictions on combinations of consonants with vowels.","[26, 27, 28, 29]"

10.1. The morphology of the suffixed verb10.1.1.   The low prefix on subordinate verbsEmbedded suffixed verbs have a low tone as a prefix. The low prefix is
lost in various phonological contexts (4.3.2.1). Of particular interest is the
fact that the low tone is apparently lost when separated by a constituent
boundary from the preceding vowel (which would otherwise function as a
host). For example the clause boundary separating a subordinate clause
from a preceding constituent forces the deletion of the low tone, and a
clause boundary separating a relative clause from the modified noun, will
also force deletion of the low tone. Thus in the sentences below, there is
no low tone before the clause-initial verb; if the verb was clause-internal
and preceded by a high toned vowel, the low tone prefix would be audible.(1)       ma       flä-kä       nä          lè              ra
          IS     [ (N)-eat-SB   AFR       ] want            ÄFF

192       Suffixed subordinate verbs10.1.1.1.       The low prefix on subordinate verbs compared with the low
                prefix on inflected verbs
Is the low prefix on an embedded verb the same morpheme as the low
prefix on a nonpast affirmative verb? Reasons for thinking that the two
morphemes are the same are (a) they have a similar phonology, being
unrealized in the same phonological contexts; and (b) both are present in
Lokai and both absent in 'Burulo.
    Reasons for thinking that the two morphemes are different are (a) the
low prefix on inflected verbs codes nonpast, but the low prefix on
subordinate suffixed verbs is compatible with any tense interpretation;
and (b) inflected verbs cannot be negated while suffixed verbs can.
    We are unable to finally decide whether the two morphemes are the
same, but as a matter of procedure we assume that they are and so we
gloss the two morphemes in the same way (with N).","[207, 208]"
"Note that in the previous sentence the ri phrase is not followed by the
focus/predication particle ?i, which would be required if the phrase was
final within its clause. This is our justification for thinking that the
demonstrative is within the subordinate clause and final within that clause,
rather than outside the subordinate clause and thus after it.
