Chapter 13        Negation
13.1   IntroductionTypologically, negation constructions in Mursi show various striking features. InMursi, a number of different negation strategies may be employed to negate verbalconstituents. The strategies vary depending on grammatical systems or categories suchas aspect, mood, and person-subject. For instance, a verb in the imperfective aspect canbe negated by bound circumclitics while a verb in the perfective aspect is negated byindependent perfective negative particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet, still’ plus bythe negative enclitic =ó attached to the perfective verb root. For instance, a verb in theimperfective aspect can be negated by bound circumclitics [ŋà=…=ó] ~<ŋà=ROOT.IMPERV=ó>, while a perfective verb can be negated by independentperfective negative form particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet’ and by the negativeenclitic attached to the root ~ <ŋànì k(V)-ROOT.PERV=ó>. So, when the negative is aperfective verb, only the negator enclitic =ó will be utilized. A further interesting pointhere is that in a negative imperative, only the negator proclitic ŋà= will be used thusthe enclitic =ó can be replaced by markers of other grammatical categories appropriateto that slot such as number and verb-final suffix.","[556, 557]"
"                                            537
The obligatory double negation system that is used for the imperfective aspect can betransformed into an optional triple negation system. The optional triple negation systemcan be achieved by combining the imperfective verb root with the preverbal perfectivenegation word ŋànì. Thus, the optional preverbial negative word ŋànì together with thenegator circumclitics on imperfective verbs forms the triple negation system.(13.6) a. nɔ̀ŋ ŋànì           ŋà=ór-Ø=ó

            ‘S/he still could not see.’
        b. nɔ̀ŋ té               hírí óɗénɛ́í ŋà=ɓà=nù          kó túmúrá

            don’t agree with Tumura. It is like this.’ (MH 6:53:2)
Therefore, both examples, the optional preverbial perfective negative word ŋànì has ameaning of ‘still’. ŋànì also has a 'persistive marker' function in other grammaticalconstructions. The occurrence of the perfective negative ŋànì and the imperfectiveaspect verb in the same clause may indicate an ongoing process/state.(13.7) [húllí nɔ̀ŋ     ŋànì     gùjò ŋà=ɗák-Ø=ó

        today=SUBORD
        ‘If it does not rain today,…’
A combination of persistive and modal meaning can be rendered by the same negationstructure, as in (13.8).(13.8)  múɲús-é       úlúgúɲ-ú         nà       ŋànì

        NEG.IMPERV=manage.3sg.SU.IMPERV=NEG
        ‘He couldn’t hide his emotion.’
Another occasion where the two co-occur in a clause is in the ‘consequence clause’ forwhich ŋànì becomes in the subordinate clause while the verb, which is negated byimperfective negative circumclitics itself becomes the main clause.","[560, 561]"
" However, since most of the time complement clauses utilize a perfective verb in thesubjunctive mood plus an eroded verb from sé ‘say’. Reason and/or purpose clauses
                                           545
may sometimes use purpose clause marker particle ɓá ‘place, cause’ which occursfollowing sé. Apart from this, in most cases both affirmative and negative complementclauses will have similar syntactic structures plus utilize identical subjunctive verbforms. See also the examples given below:(13.21) a . nɔ̀ŋ       ŋànì         ŋà=hín-Ø=ó

In (13.21a), both perfective negative particle and negated imperfective aspect are withinthe main clause which have a function of denoting that the situation will likely neverhappen. On the other hand, (13.21b) is a statement of fact although the verb in thecomplement clause hasn't been set in subjunctive form. In the imperfective aspect, acomplement clause does not occur with the perfective aspect negator ŋànì, as in(13.22a-b).(13.22) a. ŋà=ɓùrè=tá           ɓá

With regard to scope, it is worth mentioning the distinction between the negative cliticsand negative copula forms in sentences. The negator clitics ŋà= and =ó have scopeover the predicate of a clause while the negative copula forms in Table 13.3 above havesentential/clausal scopes. The third person negative copula form ŋàánó {ŋàɁánó or ŋàjó~ [ŋà=á=ó]} can negate almost any sentence/clause and therefore has a scope thatextends beyond negating a single constituent of a sentence/clause. So ŋàánó/ŋàjó canbe called sentential/clausal negator.","[573, 574]"

Interestingly, negativedeclarative clauses have an obligatory SV/AOV, constituent order, for which negatedverbs always occupy clause-final positions. This is a syntactic phenomenon that worksonly for order of negated predicates in negative clauses, which is different from theaffirmative clauses in a canonical constituent order SV/AVO and from clauses havinga marked-nominative and case marked S/A subjects OVA (in a transitive clause) VS (inan intransitive clause). Many more interesting features of the negation system arediscussed in Chapter 13.",[42]

"Besides, singular cannot be on the verb, while plural is usually marked on the verb bycopying the vowel of the verb root. This means that there are distinct number markersbeing utilized by negative and positive imperative clauses ― negative imperative -i(singular) and -o (plural); positive imperative unmarked (singular) and -V (plural). Onceagain, vowel coalescence may happen between the first person plural bound pronominalO argument suffix -i and singular negative imperative –i, as in (13.13b-c).(13.13) a. ŋà=éʤ-óɲ-í

"   However, this is not the case in Mursi. In Mursi, the subordinate conditional clausecan contain the negative word ŋànì followed by a verb in subjunctive form. Like in theimperative constructions, person cannot be marked on the subjunctive form when thesubject is second person. Person on the subjunctive form may be shown by variousforms of the verb root itself. Regarding this, Randal (1998: 248) pointed out that theremay be a possibility that historically the negative marker was a verb. This is due to thefact that, when the main verb is negated it appears in the subjunctive form, whichusually cannot mark the main verb of the subordinate clause. At this point, it isappropriate to mention that proclitics in Mursi can form a grammatical word while
                                          539
enclitics cannot. I hypothesise that the negative perfective particle ŋànì ‘not yet’ maybe a derived grammatical word that got its modal dependent form from the negativemarker proclitic ŋà= ― plus a copula verb *an and singular imperative suffix *i. Butthis has to be proven, which I guess is a matter of time. In the meantime, the followingstructural similarities have been found in negative jussive and negative interrogativeconstructions using a copula verb, as in (13.10a-b).(13.10) a. nɔ̀ŋ       ŋà=án-í
           3sg        NEG.IMPERV=COP.IMPERV-SG

           NEG.IMPERV=COP.IMPERV-SG       3sg
           ‘Shall he not become/be?’
In Mursi, the negative word ŋànì whether imperfective or perfective, always occursbefore the main verb. Arguably, Dixon (2012: 95) puts it, ‘Cross-linguistically, there isa strong tendency for negative particles to occur early in the clause’.","[562, 563]"
"13.2.1 Imperfective verb negatorsVerbs in the imperfective aspect can be negated by using two negator clitics ŋà= and=ó. Due to the fact that they are applied to a single constituent simultaneously on theverb, they can be called double negation (markers). For the interpretation of the procliticŋà= two paths were followed depending on the aspect of the verb being utilized: (i)negative imperfective <NEG.IMPERV=> when procliticized to the host (an imperfectiveverb), and (ii) negative perfective or just negative when procliticized to a perfectiveimperative verb form host. The latter has been elaborated on in the section dealing withinteraction of negation and imperative.",[558]
"Negated perfective verbs in first and third persons take a prefix k(V)-. This prefix isused as person marker for first person S/A argument while as subjunctive marker forthird person. (13.18) below illustrates a 'typical' example of negation of the perfectiveaspect verb and literal meaning of the negator particle ŋànì.(13.18) bè             ŋà=hùl=ùnù     nɔ̀ŋ ŋànì         k-íríčá=ó

"Dixon 2012: 121). However, this doesn’t mean that they don’t exist along other negatorparticles. For instance, Mursi has two indefinite-like words: àhìtí ~ [àhì-ti] <thing.SG-INDEF:NRSTR> ‘thing’ and hírkóna ~ [hír-kón-a] <person-one-INDEF:RSTR> ‘someone,a certain person, anybody’. When they are being used with the negative existentiallexeme níŋɛ̀, they may convey negative indefinite meanings ‘nothing’ and ‘nobody’respectively. The negative existential níŋɛ̀ can potentially occur anywhere, but usuallyin its typical clause-final position.(13.36) a. ŋà=kàlì=tá     àhì-tí                             ká-dáʃi

In (13.36b), the third person pronoun in the complement clause can be an optionalelement as long as the argument is cross-referenced on the verb. Thus it doesn't causea difference in meaning if deleted.(13.37) a. ŋà=ɓ=ùnù        dórí tó-jé hírkóná92

  The suffix -a is a restrictive/indefinite nominalizer at phrase level. Without -a hirkon means ‘twenty’
(Lit. ‘one man/person, referring to 10 fingers and 10 toes.’)                                                  555
In contrast, the indefinite pronoun hírkóná in (13.37b) can appear without the negativeexistential níŋɛ̀ whose meaning would mean ‘anybody’.        b. hirkón-a      ŋà=ɓá=á           íʃé?

One without the negative existential word has been found ― hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j ~ <person.SGINDEF one> ‘no one’ (Lit. a certain person). Literally, both hírkóná and hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j wouldmean ‘one/(a certain)person. However, there is one major distinction between the two,i.e. hírkóná is a compound word indefinite pronoun derived from the indefinite genericnoun hírí ‘man’ and from indefinite pronoun kóna ‘another/certain’ (a grammaticalizednumber word kón ‘one’). Whereas hírí ɗɔ́nɛ́j is derived from the same generic noun híríplus a non-grammaticalized number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’ (cf. Jesperson 1917).

A k(V)- prefix for first persons and independent personal pronouns for all other non-first persons may be employed in S function.

Despite its morphology, the inherently negative verb imagbehaves the same way as negated verbs; it usually takes clause-final position.

"   How aspect is shown in Mursi has been mentioned earlier, so here I focus on moodcategory. The mood category of Mursi includes imperative, hortative, jussive, reality,and subjunctive. All are expressed by inflectional markings on the verbs. Only thehortative and the jussive moods can be marked by an optional morphological particleaj/aɲ. In Mursi, the imperative mood refers to a command given to an addressee (thesecond person). The verb utilized in the positive imperative construction must alwaysoccur in the perfective aspect. The negative imperative construction utilizes a verb inthe imperfective aspect. However, in both constructions number can be marked on the                                          14
verb. The plural suffix -V is marked on the verb to denote plural addressee while thebare perfective verb root in its own indicates singular addressee. Person of the subjectis unmarked. Verb-final suffixes -a (for singular), -ɛ (for plural) and a variant of both,-o can be added to a clause-finally occurring verbs of the imperative constructions.(1.16) ʃíg-á

Unlike the positive imperative, the negative imperative utilizes an imperfective verbroot and different number suffixes ― despite both being commands used to deliver aspeaker's intent that a certain course of action must be carried out within a specifiedperiod of time. The negative imperative utilizes the imperfective negative proclitic ŋà=,imperfective verb root, and two invariable number suffixes -i (for singular addressee)and -o (for plural addressee). See the examples below.(1.19) ŋà=zámí-í

   The hortative and the jussive in Mursi are non-canonical imperative moods directedto first and third persons and can be used to denote a mild command. Like the canonicalimperative, positive hortative and jussive moods utilize a verb in the perfective aspectfor positive whereas negative hortative and jussive moods utilize a verb in theimperfective aspect. An interesting prosodic feature here is that a grammatical tone willbe used to distinguish between the hortative and the jussive form. The hortative mood                                           15
takes a low-toned prefix hortative k(V̀ )- and a low-toned verb root. It may optionally bepreceded by a free form high-toned hortative particle áj [áɲ] (as in (1.22).(1.21) kà-màg

   Subjunctive is one of the three moods in Mursi which are expressed by the irrealismorphological marker within the perfective aspect. Subjunctive, like the other twoirrealis moods (hortative and jussive), utilizes a prefix k(V)- and a perfective verb root.","[37, 38, 39]"

Unlike in declarative sentences in which both subjects of intransitive and transitiveverbs are obligatory marked on the verb, imperative sentences always drop markers ofboth subjects. In addition, in Mursi, both subject and the object of a transitive verb arecross-referenced on the verb. Semantically, object of a transitive verb and the recipient/beneficiary of a ditransitive verb are regarded as primary object, thus, they are cross-referenced on the verb. In the positive as well as negative imperatives, subject of any                                           337
transitivity class is not required, only object arguments are obligatorily marked on theverb.(7.47)      a. ŋà=éʤ-óɲ-í

There is also an interesting interaction between imperatives and adverbial words (timeand locative). Time words (adverbs) often occur at the beginning of a declarativesentence.(7.48)  a. ŋàmɛ́rɛ́   dáʃí
           now         do.PERV:IMP

           ʽDo now!ʼ or ‘Do it (sg.) right now!’
Locative adverbs are demonstrative constructions referring to distance. Distance
referring locative adverbs often constitute the last position of a sentence.

As it can be seen in the table above, interjections may contain forms that are quitedifferent from the regular internal phonological structure of words. As we recall, bothconsonant and vowel length do not exist in Mursi. Phonetic based consonant and vowellength may, however, exist word-medially. Examples depicting the use of interjectionare provided below.(3.154) ‘‘hee      hee      woinanoje       bóʃójè’’   sén-ɛ́

The negative interjection ɪmm ‘no’ may also be used for answering a ‘yes/no’ questions(see §13.7).","[209, 210]"
       The existence of i possibly as a sole singular number marker suggests that the       particle has no self-standing form and cannot be inflected for further grammatical       categories including for plural number.(iii) The negative existential-locative imperfective verb /níŋɛ̀/ has the same forms for       third person singular and plural. It perhaps developed from the locative suffix ni       added to the negator proclitic ŋà= and the singular positive existential verb /íh/       <exist.SG.IMPERV> which always has [i] realization due to recurrent deletion of       glottal fricative /h/ word-finally ― /h/ ~ Ø.,[581]
"
13.8 Tracing and linking negatorsWhile different types of negators constitute the negation system of the language, it isyet possible to trace the origin of the form which recurs in some of the negativeparticles. Some of the negator forms are attested in a number of Surmic group languageswhile few forms were also attested outside the group. In view of Mursi negators, there                                          557
is relatively compelling evidence in the negator proclitic ŋà= which in one way oranother is the origin for the rise of the following independent negative forms:(i)    /ŋàánó/ ~ [ŋà=Ɂán=ó] (see §13.9). The same morphological process, cliticization,       should have applied to Chai verbs because Chai has almost identical       morphological verbal negation process to Mursi. However, Last and Lucassen       (1998) didn't adequately describing the exact morphological process that has to       be employed in the negation system of the Southeasten Surmic languages. Due to       this, in their grammatical sketch of Chai language, the negator enclitic =ó has       been presented as being a final suffix -o.(ii)   /ŋànì/ may well be reconstructed from the negator proclitic ŋà= and the       imperfective copula verb an <COP.IMPERV>. The morpheme i which occurs       following the copula could possibly be a singular number marker ― ~ [ŋà=án-i].","[580, 581]"

Negative forms utilize imperfective verb roots and at the same time do not take thejussive marker prefix. Therefore, the singular form of a jussive mood may never markedas are any other imperfective aspect verbs of a declarative mood. See the examplesbelow.(7.68)   a. ŋà=báns-án-ó

2.8 CliticsClitics are morphological elements which do not have the full set of properties of anindependent (phonological) word, and may form a phonological unit with the word thatprecedes it or follows it (Matthews 1997: 56 cited in Aikhenvald (2003: 42). Above all,Aikhenvald (ff.42) points out, ‘clitics are prosaically deficient or unusual in certainways’. Mursi has seven clitics and each has its own syllable (including C ‘consonant’)and morphosyntactic function: demonstrative, definite, negative, number, subordinate,emphatic, and discourse particle. Of the seven morphosyntactic functions,demonstrative and negation are shown by circumclitics. In Mursi, circumclitics(proclitics combined with enclitics) can form independent phonological words. Thismeans, both the demonstrative and negation circumclitics can form independentphonological words having the same semantic category as the one they form whenattached to their hosts (see example 2.88). Table 2.10 below illustrates syllabic shapesof Mursi clitics.",[135]

All are expressedby inflectional markings on the verbs. Only the hortative-jussive mood can be markedby an optional free morphological particle aj/aɲ. All utilize affixes with the exceptionof the negative imperative that utilizes the negative proclitic. All mood constructionsutilize the perfective aspect verb roots.","[352, 353]"
"   Therefore, in (13.9a-b), the negative particle ŋànì comes in the subordinate clausefollowing the object or immediately following conditional/temporal marker húllí and isfollowed by the main clause which contains a negative imperfective main verb.

In (13.9a), the second person singular bound pronoun suffix is -i and it undergoes avowel height harmony change. So i has became e following the negator enclitic =ó. Innegative conditional clauses, the verb of the subordinate clause cannot be negated,rather the perfective negative particle ŋànì always occurs preceding it. As can be seenin the examples above, it makes sense for conditional clauses to operate depending onimperfective aspect because the propositions they contain are often hypothetical. It isalso highly likely the case that the negation in imperfective aspect indicates a givenaction is not going to happen. Considering this we may assume that subordinateconditional clause verbs therefore, will obviously occur in the imperfective aspect.","[561, 562]"

It is common and natural to get such repeated formsfrom the class of interjection and being used as negators.","[579, 580]"
Table 7.30 below presents the template of imperative on mood in Mursi and the verbforms and inflections utilized in the positive and negative imperative constructions.,[353]

          ‘Keep the ram in the enclosure!’The interaction of imperative and aspect resides in the distinction between positive andnegative imperatives. This is due to the nature of negative imperatives which requirean action to be acted upon immediately at the time the speaker commands, what to doright at that moment. The reality status which the positive imperative (realis) and thenegative imperative (irrealis) is also related to the speaker’s intention and rationality,― whether a command is to be carried out, will be performed immediately, or shall bedelayed seems to be a key point to be taken into account.

In (13.13b-c), the vowels coalesce into a single high front vowel. There are othermultiple morphophonological processes that take place while forming negativehortative clauses. The first person plural inclusive negative hortative has a template ofŋà=k(V)-ROOT.IMPERV-Ø while first person plural exclusive negative hortative has atemplate ŋà=k(V)-ROOT.IMPERV-(t/n)o.(13.14) a. ŋà=k-èj-tò

           NEG.IMPERV-1.HORT-come.IMPERV:PL-1pl.EXC.SU.IMPERV
           ‘Let us (exc.) not come!’
The change arises with the formation of first person plural inclusive negative hortativeform when being used as indirect negative imperative. In this case, the hortative formmay convey a negative obligation meaning. The following examples demonstrate thisfact:(13.15) a. ŋà=kì-ʃì
           NEG.IMPERV=1.HORT-listen+PL.INC
           ‘Let us (inc.) don't listen!’ (Lit. ‘We (inc.) will not listen!’)

            ‘Let us (inc.) not come!’
As can be shown in (13.15a-c), the hortative forms are not marked for plural numbereven if all are types of imperatives, i.e. non-canonical negative imperatives. (13.15a)has a consonant-final verb root ― ʃíg, then /g/ becomes [Ɂ], and finally it will be deleted
                                            542
as it gets less audible word-finally. It appears that the more harsh the imperative is, theshorter the forms tend to appear. Outside this, plural number marking on non-canonicalnegative mild imperatives is straightforward; (i) by copying the vowel of the verb root,or (ii) by inherently plural form of the verb. Some examples are given below:(13.16) a. àggè    ŋà=kì-ʃìl-ì

Chapter 11       Comparative constructions
11.1 IntroductionComparative construction is a grammatical means of showing two or more items inorder to note similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2012: 343). In order tomake a comparison between two items, there must be at least one quality (essence)which could be used as a parameter, and that the two items share in common. In otherwords, comparing of two or more items involves quality association, an indispensableapproach which would help us to understand where the difference between the itemslies or to what extent/degree the difference between the items in comparison is viable.","[515, 516, 517, 518]"

But this match occurswhen negated copula forms are being used in tag question constructions. In addition,the instance in which the tag forms occur with independent pronouns can besubstantiated by the fact that the sentences (but not the tags) involve non-copula verbs.(13.28) a. jɔ̀g àggì=nù        ɛ́ŋɛ́r-ɛ́=ŋà,

  It is not clear but there seems to be a connection between the verbal form wur ‘return back’ and
preposition/relator/adverbial form wùrɛ́ɔ́ ‘after, afterwards, later, behind, last, etc’.",[573]
"   In light of the above holistic definition of imperfective and perfective, Mursi setscertain mood and voice categories into one of the two aspectual categories. For instance,an imperfective verb root is used for negative imperative mood while the perfectiveverb root is used for positive imperative, hortative/jussive and subjunctive moods. Thepassive voice also utilize the perfective verb root. All categories of mood are discussedin §7.3.1.2.",[337]
"                                              547
With regard to these negative relative clause formations and the semantics which canbe associated with them, the following points need to be taken into account:   (i)     Since Mursi is a language that has no grammatical gender, gender related           constructions can be substituted by appropriate nouns or natural gender           displaying words. Thus hírí ‘man’ in (13.25a) may refer to both genders but           it usually refers to a masculine ~<3sg.M>. The noun hòja ‘female’ in           (13.25b) displays feminine ~ <3sg.F>. In fact, hírí alone may be used to refer           to a male referent.","[570, 571]"
"      Negative relative clauses in Mursi follow the same syntactic pattern of affirmativerelative clauses. It is very plausible to assume that almost all negative relative clausescome out of noun modification forms structured by a gapping strategy.(13.25) a. hír-á          [Ø           ŋànì   kè-ŋè-à=ó]RC

The other interesting but unusual behavior of the bound imperfective negator is in theimperative clause. Imperative clause in Mursi is formed by attaching the negatorproclitic ŋà= to an imperfective verb. The negator enclitic =ó cannot be used in thenegative imperative clause construction. The template of a negative imperativeconstruction is as follows:             ŋà=ROOT.IMPERV-i      …..singular             ŋà=ROOT.IMPERV-o      …..plural(13.12) a. ŋà=ɓág-í

            NEG.IMPERV=sing.IMPERV-PL
            ‘You (pl) don't sing!’On the other hand, positive imperative is formed by using a perfective verb root.","[563, 564]"
"In the negative imperative construction, singular addressee can also be marked on theverb root but in the imperfective aspect. Unlike in the positive imperatives, vowelcopying is not applicable in the negative imperative constructions. The suffix -i markssingular addressee whereas -o marks plural addressee, as in (6.70a-d).(6.70) a. ŋà=éʤ-í

A few derived adjectives can be marked for number in the same way as nouns, but byslightly different number-marking suffixes. Two derived adjectives of dimension andtwo adjectives of colour take an overt plural number marking. These four adjectivestake the plural suffix -a. This is a plural suffix usually marked on nouns that belong toCATEGORY III in the marked plural system. What is unusual about this plural suffix isthat it has allomorphs [-ta] and [-na].","[303, 304]"
"For instance, the Mursi main negators ŋà= and =ó undoubtedly have clitic status whilein Chai (another Southeastern Surmic group language), ŋa has been reported as anindependent particle (Last and Lucassen 1998: 418). Last and Lucassen also reportedanother independent negative particle ŋásò. However, such form has not been found inmy corpus so far, despite it being an acceptable morphological form in Mursi. If anysuch form exist in Mursi, it is undoubtedly reconstructed from two clitics ― the negatorproclitic ŋà= and from floating emphatic enclitic =so.",[582]
" The six tone melodies of monosyllabic and disyllabic nouns listed earlier and including other tone melodies of polysyllabic nouns not listed here make Mursi nouns have very diverse tone patterns. On the contrary, tonal melodies of verbs are built upon only three inherent lexical tones: H, HL and LH. Roughly more than 90 percent of Mursi monosyllabic verb roots are inherently H-toned. Tone spreading and/or tone association is always leftward. In accordance with the lexical tone patterns observed on verb roots, the following basic rules may partially govern the tone assignment system on verb roots.i.H-toned verb roots always surface with a level H tone under any environment. (2.75)  a. čúr-ó                   rúm-íɲá
            wash.IMPERV-2pl.SU.IMPERV cloth-PL
            ‘You (pl.) wash clothes.’
 This rule remains constant even when a zero suffix bound pronominal suffix accompanies a H-toned verb root, as in (2.75b).             b. lúsì  ɗág-Ø             hírí-ó
                boy     hit-3sg.SU.IMPERV man-NOM
                ‘The man beats the boy.’
 ii.      In H-toned verb root of HL melody, L is deleted and becomes H. A similar rule is suggested by Mütze (2014) but needs further study. See the following examples. (2.76)   a. éʤ-ì                             bì
              shoot.IMPERV-2sg.SU.IMPERV        cow

              shoot.IMPERV-3sg.SU.IMPERV        cow
              ‘He shoots the cow.’
 In (2.76a), the H-tone associates with the HL verb root itself, not with something else that follows the verb. Tone association other than the lexical verb itself appears to be the property of a polar tone associated with LH verb roots. The reason is that tone
                                             101
polarity on verb roots usually happens when the H tone associates with tonelesssuffixes. Thus, the tone polarity on LH verbs can be interpreted in terms of thefollowing two rules:iii.   The L tone of the verb root associates with a polar tone (H) of the suffix (as       in (2.77a-b).iv.    If the suffix attached to the verb root has zero morpheme realization, then the L       tone of the verb root associates with a polar tone (H) of the following word (as in       (2.77c).(2.77)    a. hàlí    kì-dìr-í                 dórí

In (14.6b), dàmì ‘custom, rule’ can be interpreted as ‘according to' or 'in (the same)manner’. This also aligns with some of Ethiopian languages which use accord phrasesand clauses in accordance with the information presented earlier or agreement withrules, traditions, etc. (Kuteva et.al, 2019: 397-98).","[585, 586]"
"   To sum up, the second person singular form of the canonical imperative is one of theshortest formally marked forms in the language ― rɛ (wait.PERV:IMP) ‘wait (sg.)!’ andthe second person plural form of the canonical imperative is the shortest of allmorphologically marked forms. The perfective verb root alone can denote an abruptcommand directed to second person addressee. All inflectional morphology of thecanonical and non-canonical (hortative/jussive) imperative can be exhaustively markedon the positive as well as on the negative imperative verb from slot 1, 2, 7, and 14.",[372]
"Valence and negation are discussed in Chapter 9 and Chapter 12 respectively. Exceptfor tense and reflexive action that are expressed by separate grammatical words, all theother components of non-spatial and spatial setting in Mursi are expressed in theinflectional system. Moreover, two verbal grammatical categories ― causative and                                          146

"Person/subject cannot be marked on the imperative forms. Number of addressee can bemarked on the verb by a vowel suffix -V (vowel-copying) which is usually identicalwith the vowel of the verb root.(6.69) a. ʃíg-í-ɛ̀

However, there is a difference between positive and negative imperative constructions.",[303]

When the verb acquires identical root form in both imperfective and perfective aspect,the negator proclitic becomes the sole grammatical morpheme which shows aspect ofthe verb. The first person plural exclusive bound pronominal S/A suffix -o oftenfuses/coalesces with the negative enclitic =ó as in (13.4b).            b. ŋà=kó-jóg=ó

               ‘We (exc.) will not speak; we (exc.) don’t speak.’Underlyingly, (13.4b) will be realized as <ŋà=kó-jóg-o=ó>. Despite these rare andspecific morphophonemic changes, in other forms of the negation of declarativeclauses, the interaction of verbs and negator clitics show consistency regardless of theform of verb roots. Examples strengthening this fact are given below.(13.5) a.     ŋà=dáʃí-Ø=ó
              NEG.IMPERV=work-3sg.SU.IMPERV=NEG

Thus, all, vowel-final verb root (13.5a), vowel-initial verb root (13.5b), and derivationalmorphemw suffixed verb (13.5c) operate freely without morphophonemic processes.",[560]
"It has two negative varieties: (i) ŋaano ([ŋaɁano] ~ <ŋà=án=ó>) (13.27a) whichindicates that it has been a consonant-final root at an early stage of the language, and(ii) ŋajo ([ŋajo] ~ <ŋà=á=ó>) which shows it is indeed an uninflected form of a.",[573]
"The difference is that the verb turns into imperfective aspect when negated, as can beshown by the negative hortative template below.",[367]
