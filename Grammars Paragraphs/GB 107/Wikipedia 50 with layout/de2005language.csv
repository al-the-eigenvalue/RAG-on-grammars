"       It has been noted, for instance, that the negative clitics not only require suchmorphology, but display a morphological make up that may be seen as evidence for averbal diachronic origin, namely, the consonant k-, analyzed here as a reflex of the thirdperson accusative prefix. Other factors that have been considered are its clause-finalposition and its possiblity of occurrence with the clitic ne. The presence of this cliticsuggests an affinity of the form ket with the class of descriptive verbs, in that some ofthem often co-occur with the morpheme ne. These are simple observations, however, andneed to be further investigated.
                                                                                                     298
        The morphosyntactic and distributional facts about the negative morphemessuggest that they may have all originated diachronically from verbal sources. At least inregard to the morpheme ket, a plausible hypothesis is that it must have started out as amonosyllabic negative predicator of tV structure, and that the kV- syllable is a reflex ofthe accusative prefix ku-, also noted in other function words, such as kumrc ‘INTS’ andkt ‘3.ERG’, among others (see chapter IV). The hypothetical predicator *tV must havebeen responsible for the negation of the proposition described in the clause, thusrequiring the nonfinite form of the subordinate verb; whereas the morpheme ku- couldhave operated as an anaphoric/resumptive pronoun, referring back to the negatedproposition. Verbs do take noun phrases as arguments; and it is quite possible that thedistribution of ku- was restricted to cases of propositional, not nominal, negation in a paststage of Apinajé.1 However, since the most frequent scope of negation is the proposition,the use of the *kVtV form may have become more standardized, leading to its reanalysisas the negative stem of Apinajé thus replacing other related forms elsewhere in thegrammar. As far as phonological changes, one could speculate a path such as *kute >*kete > ket, for Apinajé, with vowel harmony and eventual deletion of the stem finalvowel. In any case, it is no longer possible to speak of ket and ketne as true verbs in1
  In Kaingang (Southern Jê), one of the negative markers is indeed a monosyllabic morpheme beginning in
/t/: tõ ‘NEG’ (Wiesemann 1986). However, in that language this form of the negative is employed in narrow
scope negation, specifically, in the negation of nouns; sentential negation is expressed by a similar ket
morpheme. (Thanks to Eduardo Ribeiro for calling my attention to this piece of data, in personal
communication.)

Apinajé. These morphemes have now become positional clitics which do not display thefull morphosyntactic behavior and semantic content of a lexical verb.","[311, 312, 313]"

       In (76), the negative existential notion seems to be expressed by means of negatedlocative predicates, which characteristically involve the use of positional verbs. For thatreason, the verbal negative ket=ne is employed here.

       Negation of intransitive (77-78) and transitive (79) verbal predicates is invariablyencoded by the clitic sequence ket=ne. The nonfinite form of the verb is required by thenegative marker. However, the ergative marker does not ever occur in the negation oftransitive predicates.","[264, 265]"
"        Thus, the strategies presented in (39-40) are not exactly instances of noun phrase,but clausal coordination. Further details on this subject are in section (4).

3. Clause structureIn what follows, the various types of main clause structure are introduced. It will be seenthat some of the variation found in verbal clauses is due to the major distinction betweenthe realis and irrealis mode, as well as to speech-act distinctions, especially the contrastbetween affirmative and negative sentences. Other differences in the structure of verbalclauses are due to the morphosyntactic nature of the predicators involved, namely, thosethat entail the standard pattern of argument marking already introduced (sections III.3.2.1.and III.4.1.1), as against those predicators that involve non-canonical patterns of argumentmarking.
                                                                                          224
3.1. Mode distinctionsThe realis and irrealis encompass all clause structure types in Apinajé. That is, clausesare either realis or irrealis, structurally. From a semantic and functional perspective, therealis mode includes past, present, habitual – negative, positive or interrogative –propositions. The irrealis mode comprises future, hypothetical, counterfactual,conditional, intentive – negative, positive, interrogative and some imperative –propositions. Speech act distinctions therefore do not interfere with mode distinctions,for the most part (except for one type of imperative, as will be seen below).","[236, 237, 238]"
"       Finally, the adverbial notion of a temporal negative, ‘never’, involves the co-occurrence of the generic negative marker ket with what could be analyzed as a temporalcomponent, a, glossed here as ‘ever’. Together, a...ket form what could be describedstructurally as a “circumclitic”. The temporal marker precedes the element under thescope of negation, and the negative marker ket follows it, occupying the constituent finalposition, as expected.

       ever 1-machete       NEG

4. Grammatical relationsKeenan (1976) proposes a set of criteria, which may apply to different languages to agreater or lesser extent, for a definition of Subject as a universal category. The idea ofgrammatical relations as a universal category has been questioned by Dryer (1997), who
                                                                                              254
points out that, while a set of criteria may be helpful to establish what similarities thereare amongst languages, these similarities do not explain why languages are the way theyare. Any similarities are, he claims, the reflexes of functional and cognitive processeswhich themselves may be universal. Thus, it is not grammatical relations as such that areuniversal. Each language displays its own relevant grammatical relations, which may ormay not coincide with the notions of “Subject” and “Object” as found in other languages.","[267, 268]"

       The negation of descriptive verb predicates, illustrated in (80), presents somevariation as to which form of the negative should be used. Most consultants tended toemploy ket=ne for negation of descriptive predicates. However, at least one consultantshowed preference for the use of the simplex negative morpheme ket in these contexts.","[265, 266]"
"Nominal predicates are negated with the clause-final clitic ket, verbal predicates with theclitic sequence ket=ne, whereas existential predicates can be negated either with ket or
                                                                                            249
the negative existential pronoun amrakati; apparently, some negated locative predicates(section 3.5) may function as negative existentials as well, except that these predicatesare characterized by the use of positional verbs in predicate position which are, therefore,negated with ket=ne.","[262, 263]"
"         Example (16.b) is more complex in that the first event of the sequence consists oftwo clauses – i.e. two minor events: the wait for the potatoes to cook, and the cooking ofthe potatoes. Within that domain, the subjects of the first and second events are distinct,
                                                                                           290
thus the different-subject third person conjunction occurs in the second clause. Althoughthere is no structural evidence of subordination between the clauses expressing the firstand second events, the ‘cook’ clause stands in a complement-type relation with the ‘wait’clause, albeit semantically. For the purposes of the construction being described in thepresent section, those two clauses are taken here as if constituting a unit.

         The second possibility (‘before SBJ X, SBJ will Y’) includes the negative markerket. Here, the order of the clauses is reversed in the sentence: the first clause encodes theevent that should happen last in the sequence; the particle ri occurs postposed to thisclause and the negator ket modifies its predicate.

3.5. Locative predicatesLocative predicates follow the same pattern as verbal clauses, since they involve positionverbs, which are typically intransitive. Thus, this clause type includes the mood marker,the subject nominal, the locative adverbial and a position verb, such as ca ‘stand’,  ‘sit’,or other, depending on the number of the absolutive argument (section III.3.1.2.3.)(71) a. kt   kaj      ja=ri            arik.

3.6. Existential predicatesExistential predicates are structurally similar to locative predicates, except that in theseconstructions the verb is dispensed with. The necessary elements are simply the locationand the referent located, which typically comes accompanied by a quantifier or theexistential negative amrakati in the predication.

3.7. NegationNegation is another dimension whereby clauses can be subcategorized into structuraltypes. Negation applies differently depending on the type of predicate being negated.","[260, 261, 262]"
"        Polarity questions may be expressed with exactly the same kind of structure assimple declarative clauses, but with a distinct intonation pattern; or the question may beintroduced by the positional clitic c (alternative form co, depending on the speaker),which co-occurs with the mode markers, but at absolute clause-initial position (45.a-b).",[240]
"Compensatory lengthening applies to a plosive-final lexical base when it is followed by aconsonant-initial morpheme – that is, the plosive is deleted, being replaced by vowellengthening. If the lexical base ends in glide or vowel, no lengthening applies (91-92).

4.5. ProsodiesAspiration. Aspiration occurs between a syllable-final vowel and a stressed syllablebeginning in voiceless obstruent. Vowels often involved in the process are the centrallow phoneme /a/ or the back high phoneme /u/. Aspiration often takes place atmorpheme boundary, but within the same phonological word.
(93) a. /me katut/                    [m gahtut]           ‘(one’s) back’
     b./atõt/                         [ahtõt]               ‘kinship term’
     c. /apoj/                         [ahpoj]                ‘depart’
     d./kute/                         [guhte]               ‘riffle’
Echo-vowels. Closed syllables usually display an echo-vowel word finally. The echo-vowel is a phonetically reduced sound whose quality is reminiscent of that of the vowelat the nucleus. Words ending in the voiceless affricate /t/ are an exception; the quality ofthe echo vowel in this case is reminiscent of the palatal quality of the consonant – it is [i].

(94) a. /mbop/                [mbobo]               ‘(edible) root’
     b./  /                [   ]              ‘clear; yellow’
     c /ton/                  [tono]                ‘armadillo’(95) a. /pit/                [pidi]               ‘only’
     b./mb t/                [mb di]              ‘good’

     b./kot/                  [koo]                ‘after; behind’
        The echo-vowel indicates the end of a phonological word. It occurs most often incontent words, though there are instances of echo-vowels in function words too. Themorphemes ket and kot, in (96), are a negative particle and a postposition, respectively.","[91, 92, 93]"
"       Some aspects in the overall structure of ri constructions which show that the ri-marked clause is in fact structurally subordinate to that in sentence-final position are asfollows. In examples (16.a) and (17.b), repeated as (18) below, the sentence-final clauseshave the typical distribution of a main predicate, and the subject of each is that expressedby the nominative pronoun at the beginning of the whole complex sentence. As for theri-marked elements, they have the distribution that a postpositional phrase would have,and they come marked with a postposed particle that, in other contexts, may functioneither as a demonstrative or a locative. An alternative semantic interpretation of the ri-marked expressions in the examples below then could be, respectively, ‘at/upon/when[clause]’. Hence the alternative translations:

5.2. The postposition kutep       The morpheme kutep marks a temporal adverbial construction, which consists ofclauses that encode simultaneous events. The clauses in question do not occur in asubordinating relation: they occur in a paratactic relation with one another and each hasits own subject. That the clauses involved belong in the same sentence is indicated by thefact that they fall under the scope of the same mood marker; and by the intonation patternof the utterance, which clearly includes them both.","[305, 306]"

                                         CHAPTER I                                       INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this dissertation is to present a description of the language spoken by theApinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. The study is based on originaldata collected by the author in various trips to the field between October 1995 andAugust 2000, as well as in interviews with speakers of the language in the city ofGoiânia, Goiás State, Brazil. Rather than a definite account of the language, this work isintended as the kernel of what will evolve into a more comprehensive grammar as furtheranalysis is conducted; for the time being, my main goal is to lay out as many patterns ascan possibly be distilled from the available data, regarding the phonology, morphology,lexicon, and syntax of the language. From a broader perspective, I hope this study willserve as an effective source for historical-comparative work aiming at the reconstructionof the Jê linguistic family, and thus constitute an additional piece for the betterunderstanding of the Macro-Jê stock, a still hypothetical classification for a number oflittle-documented South American languages.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"       The negation of juxtaposition nominal predicates, expressed by the simplexnegative ket, is illustrated in (73). (There are no examples of negated copular predicatesavailable in the database.) The examples (73.c-d) demonstrate that the complex negativemarker is not preferred in this syntactic context.",[263]
"         In the first construction (‘SBJ will X, then SBJ will Y’), the particle ri isimmediately postposed to the clause(s) describing the first event in the sequence; theclause expressing the second event occurs last in the sentence. In the examples below,the two events in sequence share the same subject, so the subject is mentioned only onceat the beginning of the sentence.",[303]
"
        In the constructions above, the two clauses are tightly bound into a singlesentence: (i) a single modality morpheme occurs at the beginning of the utterance; (ii) nomorphemes intervene between the two clauses involved (note that  ane ‘do thus’constitutes a single predicate); and (iii) the intonation pattern treats the two as a singleunit. (The absence of a modality marker in (92.c) is due to the imperative speech act.) Inaddition, in the case of the periphrastic causatives in (92) the two clauses are linked bythe fact that they share an argument: the object of  ane ‘do thus’ is coreferential withthe causee, which is expressed by the independent pronoun placed at the beginning of theresult clause. Now consider the example in (93).
(93) na rp ri     ic-t- ane ne pa         ami pe        i--õ gwra kago kapi
      RLS dog DEM 1-RP-do thus FCT 1          RFLX DTR        1-PSSR buriti juice spill
    ‘The dog caused me to spill my juice (i. e. it ran across my way, I tripped on it and
    dropped the bowl with the juice).’
                                                                                          263
       Here we note the occurrence of the particle ne between the two clauses. Thepresence of the conjunction suggests that in (93) the clauses expressing cause and resultare not as formally bound to each other as those in (92).

"5.1. Ri constructionsThe particle ri serves as an indicator of sequential relation between events, as describedby clauses in a sentence. The particle appears in two kinds of constructions: the firsttranslates as ‘SBJ will X, then SBJ will Y’; the second translates as ‘before SBJ X, SBJ willY’.",[303]
"Their list is as follows:
        A grammatical word consists of a number of grammatical elements which:
              (a) always occur together, rather than scattered through the clause (the
                  criterion of cohesiveness);
              (b) occur in a fixed order;
              (c) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning. (...)
              (d) Morphological processes involved in the formation of words tend to be
                  non-recursive. That is, one element will not appear twice in a word. (...)
              (e) There will be just one inflectional affix per word. (...)
              (f) A speaker may pause between words but not within a word. (...)
              (g) A word may constitute a complete utterance, all by itself (Dixon and
                  Aikhenvald 2002:19-25).",[102]
"
1.   ComplementationThe examples of complementation existing in my database consist of clausalcomplements occupying positions other than that of a sentence subject. Additionally, theoverwhelming majority of complement-taking predicators are of the noncanonicalmarking type, most often involving the use of the dative postposition m. These may bemere coincidences; however, there has been at least one instance in which I tried to elicita sentence that included a clausal complement in subject position, and speakers offeredparatactic clauses, instead.
                                                                                              277
       As already mentioned, the use of subordination for the expression ofcomplementation requires that the subordinate verb be in its nonfinite form. Thesubordinate clause occupies some position between the matrix verb, which occurs in finalposition, and the positional clitics normally occupying sentence-initial position. Sincethe complement-taking verbs noted all involve the use of a postposition for marking oneof the core arguments (which could be either A or O, depending on the verb), it is oftenthe case that the clausal complement will be immediately preceded by this case marker,when A is the noncanonically marked argument.","[290, 291]"

(The “say” part of the meaning is indicated by the dative postposition m combined withthe predicator ane.) The possibility that the second clause is an imperative clause isdisconfirmed by the intonational pattern of the sentence.

2.   RelativizationRelativization in Apinajé is necessarily expressed by means of subordination. Thus,other morphosyntactic properties internal to Apinajé relative clauses include the facts thatthe verb must occur in its nonfinite form and, if it is a transitive verb, the ergative casemarker must occur on the first nominal constituent of the subordinate clause.","[294, 295]"

3.2.2.4.MovementMovement verbs unspecified for direction, such as mõ, te, bra and so on, require theoccurrence in the clause of a movement particle that specifies whether the motion iscentripetal or centrifugal.9 This particle is the positional clitic ma, which occurs in thesame general area of the clause as the other positional clitics.(121) a.

 Relational Prefixes (RP) are part of the inflectional system of Apinajé. These morphemes occur
pervasively in vowel-initial nouns, verbs and postpositions of Apinajé. See details in section 4.1.2. below.

1.2. AffixesInflectional and derivational affixes are often monosyllabic morphemes whose structureis restricted to the V(C) and CV(C) syllable patterns. Certain inflectional affixes mayconsist of a single consonant, as is the case with relational prefixes and nonfinitenesssuffixes (sections 4.1.2. and 4.1.3.). Affixes do not display any particular stressproperties in Apinajé; they simply contribute segmental material to the phonologicalword, submitting to the overall stress rule applicable to that word. The verb pi ‘kill’ isinflected for person in (5). The finite form of the verb is shown in (a), and its nonfiniteform in (b).
(5) a. ic-pi                  [ic pi]            ‘kill me’
       a-pi                   [a pi]             ‘kill you’
       ku-pi                  [gu pi]            ‘kill it’      b. ic-pi-r              [ic pi ]           ‘kill me’
                                                                                                            85
         a-pi-r                     [a pi ]          ‘kill you’
         Ø-pi-r                     [ pi ]           ‘kill it’
         Formatives display the same structural properties as affixes, certainly becausethey too were affixes at an earlier stage in the development of the language. For instance,it is possible to identify personal prefixes that have been reanalyzed as part of somestems, which take productive inflectional morphology at the synchronic level (6).
(6) a. kupe                          [gu pe]           ‘touch’                     < ku- ‘3’

       pr n-ipok ri                 [ p ni pog ri] ‘in the core of the forest’1.3. CliticsClitics may be of three kinds: positional clitics, phrasal clitics and word clitics, all ofwhich display specific stress properties and, like the roots, may come in any of thesyllable patterns available. Positional clitics occupy specific slots in the structure of theclause, and they usually encode grammatical categories that pertain to the proposition asa whole, such as mood, tense, aspect and the like (7). Few phrasal clitics indicate theinitial boundary of a phrase; the tendency is for them to occur phrase finally (8). Thesame is true of word clitics, except that their structural domain is restricted to the(grammatical) word (9).2

2.     WordIn any language, words can be characterized in terms of phonological and grammaticalproperties, which constitute independent criterial dimensions. One general definition ofthe phonological word is provided in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) as follows:
          A phonological word is a phonological unit larger than the syllable (in some
          languages it may minimally be just one syllable) which has at least one (and
          generally more than one) phonological defining property chosen from the
          following areas:and occupy predictable positions in clauses and phrases.
                                                                                                88
               (a) Segmental features – internal syllabic and segmental structure;
                  phonetic realisations in terms of this; word boundary phenomena; pause
                  phenomena.
               (b) Prosodic features – stress (or accent) and/or tone assignment; prosodic
                  features such as nasalization, retroflexion, vowel harmony.
               (c) Phonological rules – some rules apply only within a phonological
                  word; others (external sandhi rules) apply specifically across a word
                  boundary.
         Note that there is likely to be a close interaction between these types of features
         (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 13).","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]"
"Nonetheless, Apinajé morphology is more complex than it might seem at first, especiallywith respect to the major lexical categories of the language: Nouns, Verbs and
                                                                                             vPostpositions. These word classes, especially Nouns and Verbs, are characterizedmorphologically by the presence of formatives, which are recurrent morphs that are eithersemantically empty or of elusive meaning, but which subcategorize words in formal orsemantic terms. The categories of nonfiniteness, person, and syntactic constituencyconstitute the core of inflectional morphology, the last applying to nouns, postpositions,and verbs. Verbs are subcategorized morphosyntactically into transitives, intransitivesand descriptives, displaying a split intransitivity system with respect to verbal person-marking. Word order is predominantly SOV. Syntactically complex constructionsinclude verb serialization and clause subordination, with ergative case-marking acharacteristic of subordinate clauses.

       Verb arguments may be expressed by full noun phrases within the verb phrase orby person prefixes; either way, vowel-initial predicators must take relational prefixes.",[233]
"       The morpheme kutep is a postposition that indicates something like ‘in one’sstead’. Functionally, it clearly indicates the simultaneous relation between the eventsdescribed in each clause. As to its distribution in the sentence, it occurs in the clause thatserves as the ground event with respect to which the other, simultaneous event is located.",[306]

       Personal pronouns participate in the expression of mood, a category that isobligatorily expressed in the clause. First and second person pronouns take the suffix -jto indicate irrealis mood; thus, two series of speech-act-participant pronouns surfacebecause of this distinction (106). The irrealis form of the pronoun typically co-occurswith the mood marker kt in the beginning of the sentence (sections 3.2.2.1 and IV.2.1).",[175]
"       The Apinajé grammatical word can be identified according to some of the criterialisted in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19-25). First, the grammatical word is internallycohesive, both formally, since its components constitute a bound unit; and semantically,because that unit conveys a conventionalized meaning. Secondly, the component
                                                                                              92
morphemes of a grammatical word in Apinajé follow a particular order, with word cliticsalways occupying the outermost final position in the word, thus indicating the word finalboundary, and person prefixes appearing in first position, when applicable, thusindicating the word-initial boundary. Thirdly, speakers generally utter the word withoutinterruptions or pauses, except in case of hesitations, clarifications or factors of this sort,which are part of natural speech in any language. Finally, the Apinajé grammatical wordcan constitute a complete utterance by itself.","[105, 106]"

3.3.2. Noncanonical predicatesThe typology of argument marking proposed in Onishi (2001) departs from theassumption that all languages include transitive and intransitive clauses, and that the corearguments of these clauses – A, S, O – will be expressed according to certain canonicalpatterns noticeable in that given language. Additionally, languages will also display a setof predicators that include what he terms “extensions to the core”, which he indicates
                                                                                          231
with the symbol E (which stands for “extended argument”, following Dixon 1994). The“core” plus “extensions” result in four clause types, displayed schematically below (fromOnishi 2001: 2), in which core arguments may be marked in the most diverse ways,crosslinguistically.","[244, 245]"

               verbs, the subject of descriptive verbs, and the object of postpositions. Phonology:
               allomorph ah– before voiceless obstruents; allomorph a– before pre-nasal and nasal
               consonants.
a ... ket ne   advl.neg.cmp. never . Ex.: Na t da wr ru ne d um go ja a upm ket ne. ‘It rains a
               lot, but this creek has never been deep.’ See r ‘always’.
aˆ             v.tr. cut (deep, of skin and body parts; of wood). Ex. Pa na pa am¯i) jaˆk ¯um itkabro
               atkapi) ‘I cut myself and my blood spilled.’ Nonfinite form: aˆk (before consonants),
               aˆr (before vowels and consonants). Inflection pattern and relational prefix: O=j-aˆ.
               Related forms: u-j-aˆ ‘brocar’ (elderly). Grammatical restrictions: *Na pa ku-j-aˆ.
               *(?) Aw-j-aˆ. *Na ra aˆr ç te) ‘S/he went and cut as they went’; Na ra aˆr/ujaˆr ç mõ
               ‘S/he was cutting/was about to cut’. See kˆjt.
a(C)–          prfx.der. detransitivizing prefix. Grammar: a. Occurs in a large group of intransitive
               verbs, some of which do not have a transitive counterpart characterized simply by the
               absence of this prefix. In such cases, the occurrence of the prefix appears to have been
               lexicalized, and the prefix might be better analysed as a formative in the stem, rather
               than a derivational prefix. b. The presence of this prefix in most verbs simply
               indicates intransitivity; there is a contrast between this and the prefix aw- in that the
               latter appears to encode the antipassive. See aw-.
ajgr          v.intr. scatter. Nonfinite form: S=pigr. Ex.: Ja na m pip ketne; na m m ajgr

               and relational prefix: O=j-ab . Nonfinite form: ab . Grammar: This verb appears to
               be a derived counterpart of the transitive verb b . Intensifiers such as tjc, rac and ru
               have slightly different readings when used with each verb. Ex.: Na pa ab  tjc ne. ‘I

aba             v.intr. ponder; feel; meditate. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-aba.

                ‘They tease all the time.’ Na pa ijabakr tjc ne. ‘I tease a lot.’ (aba=kr
                ‘ear=spoiled’) See  abrakr.

                pattern and relational prefix: S=j-abatper; OE=m S=j-abatper. Nonfinite form:

                enter. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-ac. Nonfinite form: O=cr. Ex.:

                pattern and relational prefix: O=j-ac. Nonfinite form: O=cr. Ex.: Na pa ice jac. ‘I

           jac. ‘I put my flip-flops on.’ Semantics: This verb root seems to contrast with agje in
           terms of number. Ac is used when the absolutive argument is singular. See r, agje.
ac       v.tr. 1. bury. 2. confine; incarcerate; arrest. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:
           O=j-ac. Nonfinite form: O=acn. Grammar: This verb has a derived intransitive
           counterpart in awjac. Ex.: Na m kupedir jaja kupip jac. ‘The kupe women buried
           the mat.’ Na pa pˆka kam´) ac‡´ ‘I buried it in the ground’. Na pa t, ka ijac. ‘I died

acw       v.tr. 1. place multiple objects upside down on a surface (e.g. on the ground or on a
           table). 2. place an object in horizontal position. 3. comb one’s hair. Inflectional
           pattern and relational prefix: O=j=acw . Nonfinite form: acw r. Semantics: One
           aspect in which this verb (and its counterpart i) contrasts with the pair m, ujw is that
           the former may refer to objects shaped in such way that would usually be conceived of
           as lying in horizontal position (e.g. forks and knives), whereas the latter often refer to
           those that could be thought of as “standing up” (e.g. bowls, plates, cups). On the other
           hand, the former pair may also refer to this same class of objects, but indicating that
           they lie upside down. Ex.: Na pa amim iõ kuj jacw . ‘I’ve set my spoons down.’
           Na pa amim iõ prat jacw . ‘I’ve set my plates upside down.’ Akupm im acw .
           ‘Put them back for me, will you?’ Pa na pa ktm aki jacw r  mõ um prti ma te.
           ‘I was still combing your hair and the truck left.’ Na ka t ijab pa t gõr bri ka

ag´        n.al. the seed of the tiritica plant (see kapar) used for making necklaces and other
           adonrments. Lexical restriction: *ag . The word  is not appropriate because it
           refers to seeds that come from within fruits, shells or skins; that is not the case for the
           tiririca seed.
ag       v.tr. thresh; remove the seeds from the chaff (of rice). Nonfinite form, -g´)n. See ag.

           on a string (e.g. glassbeads); pull something through a whole. Inflectional pattern and
           relational prefix: O=j-agje. Nonfinite form: agje. Ex.: Na pa m agje. ‘We all went
           in.’ Im ken kw jagje. ‘Thread some beads for me.’ Impõij u p pa ami jabak
           kot agje. ‘Get me a little põ stem for me to hang on my ear.’ Semantics: This verb
           stem is used when the absolutive argument is plural. See gje; ac.

           Grammar: This verb seems to have a transitive counterpart: gr. There is one example
           in the database that is indicative of this, but it is not to be confused with the verb gr
           ‘dry’. Lexicon: This predicator may be simply an alternative use of the verb agr
           ‘scatter’. Ex.: Na ickrE krac‡ agr´ ‘The wall got damaged.’ Tm na ami gr. ‘I got
           damaged (i.e. it wasn’t me).’ See gr; ajgr.

agre ti    n.aug. type of armadillo (Port.: zumbi). Lives in the woods and is larger in size,
           measuring about 30 cm as an adult. The female of the species typically has one

           2. be hanging. 3. reach; catch up with someone. Nonfinite form: S=jet. Grammar: a.
           Clause typically includes a postpositional phrase expressing the location in which S is
           suspended or from which it is hanging. If a location from which S is hanging is not
           specified in the clause, it may be expressed as kc pe ‘from a [hanger]’. b. * ajet.
           Ex.: Mkarõ kawr  ajet. ‘The photograph is (suspended) in the basket.’ Na mkarõ

              ‘talk=AG.NMLZ’)
ake)c‡        v.dscr. spin; turn around. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-akec.
              Grammar: This verb cannot take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: *awjakec.
              Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: This predicator has a bivalent counterpart in  akec.
              Ex.: Ajakec! ‘Turn around/spin!’

              (upon) me.’ Na ka t im ajakjer  akri. ‘You keep arguing with me.’ Ne na t me

              and relational prefix: O=j-akoji. (ako=ji ‘smoke.NF=AG.NMLZ’) Ex.: Di muj cikar
              jakoji. ‘That woman is a cigarrette smoker.’ See ako; ujako, ujakoji.
akrˆ          v.dscr. be cold. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-akr. Nonfinite form:
              same. Grammar: a. In predicate position, the relational prefix does not show with a
              third person S, since the third person participant appears in subject position, and there
              is zero third person agreement marking. In attributive constructions, the verb does
              take a relational prefix with a third person participant, and that indicates both elements
              belong within a single noun phrase. b. This verb has a bivalent counterpart in  akr.
              c. This verb can take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: awjakr. Ex.: Na pa ra ijakr
               mõ. ‘I’m already cooling off (because the fever is gone).’ Na ra go akr. ‘The water

akudçko          v.intr. disappear; get lost. Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S=pikund.
                 Alternate form: akund. Phonology: In the context of an identical subsequent vowel,
                 there is an epenthetic flap [r] that separates the two, as in icpikudr  mõ. Grammar:
                 This verb has a bivalent version,  akudk. Ex.: Pa kt paj akud. ‘I’m going to
                 disappear.’ Ka na ka akud. ‘You’re going to get lost.’ Pa kt paj icpikud ketne. ‘I’m

                 kuprõ. Grammar: Occurs with the causative morpheme . Ex.: Kot paj m akupm

ami)            pro. reflexive marker. Grammar: May occur in a truncated form with the dative
                 morpheme m, resulting in the form amim.
ami c ba     Idiom. Feel ill; suffer from disease. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: [amiS
                 c-] O ba. Nonfinite form: ami c bar. Grammar: The reflexive pronoun refers back
                 to the S of c, whereas the predicate am  c is the O of the verb ba. (Ami=c-=ba
                 ‘RFLX=RP-ill=feel’) See ami kam abak.
ami kam abak Idiom. Feel better; recover from disease. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:
                 AmiS kam S-j-abak. Nonfinite form: same. Ex. Na pa ra ami kam ijabak  mõ.
                 ‘I’m feeling better.’
ami kati       v.intr.noncan. play; enjoy onself. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: Although the
                 reflexive marker occurs with this verb, the reflexive-verb root pair have become
                 lexicalized as a single predicator. The word kati by itself means ‘waist’; there is no
                 evidence for its use as a verb. In addition, the compound predicator may apparently
                 have its valency increased by means of the morpheme , in  ami kati. Ex.: Na pa
                                                                                                         366

ane)              v.intr. 1. thus; be thus. 2. instruct; order; comand. Nonfinite form: ar. Grammar:

                  form and relational prefix: S=j-ap. Grammar: a. The use of plural nouns may
                  require the co-occurrence of the dual marker. Presumably, this peculiarity has to do
                  with the semantics of the verb. b. This verb has a causative counterpart,  ap. c.
                  This verb allows for variation in nonfinite forms. It is possible that this variation is
                  determined by the meaning of the verb in each use. Ex.: Akrecti ne Kenkut wa ap ne
                                                                                                     367

ape           v.intr. work. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-ape, apen, alternate form:
              S=j-pe. Grammar: This verb does not take the derivational morpheme -ji: *apenji.
              Usage: Variation seems to be due to age groups, the former being spoken by younger
              speakers and the latter by elderly ones. Ex.: Di muj ja km apen prm. ‘That woman
              enjoys working.’

apku          v.intr. eat. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=j-apkur. Grammar: a. Related to the
              transitive verb ku ‘eat’ and apparently created by the addition of the detransitivizing
              prefix ap-. Differently than other ap- verbs, however, it maintains this formative in its
              nonfinite form. Ex.: Na pa ra apku. ‘I’ve eaten.’ Na pa ra ijapkur pa ‘I have finished
              eating.’ Na pa ktm ijapkur ket ne. ‘I haven’t eaten yet.’
apkurji      n.inal.der. one how enjoys eating; one who is characterized by the habit of eating.
              Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=j-apkurji. (apkur-ji ‘eat<INTR.NF>-
              AG.NMLZ’). Ex.: Brˆ japkurji ‘Wild animal that eats all the time.’

              marked with the postposition wr.) Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=j-apoj.
              Nonfinite form: same. 3. v.tr.noncan. find something (pl). Inflectional pattern and
              relational prefix: O=m A=j-apoj. Nonfinite form: same. Phonology: In nonfinite
              position, especially preceding a vowel, the last consonant of the root is realized as the
              voiced alveolapalatal affricate [j], as in poj  mõ. Semantics: The semantic contrast
              between this verb and kat has to do with the number of participants, kat being the
              singular and apoj the plural counterpart. Grammar: a. In the compound verb ‘wake
              up’, the verb roots alternate according to the number of the absolutive argument, thus:
              krkat ‘wake up (sg.)’ and krapoj ‘wake up (pl)’. b. The same is true when the root
              is used with directional postpositions such as wr ‘ALLT’ and m ‘DAT’. C. This verb
              cannot take the detransitivizing morpheme aw-: *awjapoj. Ex.: Na pa m ijapoj. ‘We
              left.’ Na pa m km ijapoj. ‘I found them.’ See kat.
apok          v.tr. make holes. Ex. pi) j‡ˆ rE na tE pi) japok ‘The termites make holes in in wood.’
              Form with relational prefix, -japok.
apr           v.tr. slander someone. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=j-apr . Nonfinite
              form: same. Grammar: ujapr; ujaprji; *awjapr. Ex.: Na ijapr . ‘That one slanders
              me.’ Na ka ijapr . ‘You dishonor my name.’ Na pa ajapr . ‘I gossip about you.’ Na
              ijapr  ca. ‘That one has been gossping about me.’ Muj na ijapr  ri pa. ‘That one

              O=j-apro. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: This verb can take the detransitivizing
              morpheme aw-: awjapro.

              Kwr ja na are pe mduju ‘This yucca is hard to dig.’ Kt ar t na pa are ‘It’s that

              O=j-are. Nonfinite form: are. Grammar: a. The transitivity pattern of this verb is
              the same for both senses. In the second sense, O is encoded by the reflexive pronoun,
              which is controlled by the subject. b. This verb can take the detransitivizing
              morpheme aw-: awjare. See awjare.
ari          v.dscr. 1. jump on or onto the ground; land. 2. dance in a festival. Nonfinite form and

atm          v.intr. 1. walk together as a pair or group. 2. stick together as a close pair or group of
              friends or companions. Nonfinite form and infectional pattern: S=pi-tm. Grammar: a.
              This verb takes the clause-final particle ne. b. There appears to be free alternation
              between finite and nonfinite form when this predicator is modified by kacw. Both
              forms were possible, according to speakers’ judgements; however, there was
              preference for the nonfinite form when the clause was realis, and for the finite form
              when the clause was irrealis. Ex.: Kt paj m akupm atm ne. ‘We’ll walk together
              again.’ Kt ja m akupm atm ne. ‘Those are going to wander around together again.’

              was lying there.’
atkaje        v.intr. crack; fissure. Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S=pikaje. Grammar: a.
              This verb does not have a transitive counterpart in kaje. b. There is evidence of free
              variation between pikaje and atkaje as nonfinite forms; in the latter case, it is not
              possible to tell from the examples what the inflectional pattern is. Ex.: Ka na ka icpe
              i¯õ kukrac‡ me) ¯um atkaje ‘You threw my bowl and it cracked.’ Pa kt paj bri iõ
              kukrac km amim meõ kw men ketne. D na iõ kukrac icpe atkaje pa. ‘I’m not

atkatE        v.intr.der. 1. break into pieces; shatter. 2. crack; fissure. Nonfinite form and
              inflectional pattern:. Grammar: This verb does not have a participial counterpart in pi-
              the same way as other verbs of breaking. Ex.: Na kp tem ne atkat. ‘The glass fell
              and broke [it wasn’t me].’ Kp ja na ra bu um ra atkat. ‘I saw that glass and it was

                Grammar: a. In its first sense, this verb is a reciprocal one; the predication subsumes
                two participants. b. This verb has a bivalent counterpart in  atkje. Ex.: Na pa wa
                atkje ‘The two of us parted ways.’ Icpe apikjer ketne. ‘Don’t part away from me.’ See

                with verbs that begin in /a/ and take the relational prefix j-. This morpheme contrasts
                with the other detransitivizing prefix aC– in that it appears to encode the antipassive
                and other uses of this category. In this sense, it appears to be better characterized as an
                inflectional rather than derivational morpheme. See aC- ‘detransitivizer’.

                Ex.: Di cujakor cw ja na  ne. ‘The woman that smokes is ill.’ *Di kt ujakor.... Di
                cujakor   cw muj na in na. ‘That woman who is smoking is my [formal] mother.’

awjakrˆ   v.intr.der. cool down (of weather). Nonfinite form and relational prefix:. (Finite form:
          aw-j-akr ‘INTRZ-RP-be.cold’; nonfinite form:.) Ex.: Na ra awjakrˆ ‘It is getting cold.’
          Na ra awjakr ne. ‘[The weather] is already cool.’
awjan´)   v.intr. return. Nonfinite form and relational prefix: S=c-u-j-an. (Finite form: aw-j-
          an ‘INTRZ-RP-?’; nonfinite form: c-u-j-an ‘RP-INTRZ-RP-?). Grammar: a. This verb
          follows the same morphological patterns as other derived intransitive verbs belonging
          to the aw- class. However, there is no evidence for the existence of an as a verb on its
          own. It is possible that this form may have been monomorphemic once, but has
          become lexicalized through history. b. This predicator follows the same pattern as
          awjako in subordinate position, in that it does not employ the ergative marker kt/t;
          instead, it occurs in constituency with the noun, evidence of which is the presence of
          the relational prefix in such contexts. Ex.: Di cujan cw muj ja na in na. ‘That
          woman who has returned is my [formal] mother.’ See aw-.
awjapro   v.intr.der. shop; purchase items for a party or a festival. Nonfinite form and relational

                  already.’ Na ra kabekr tk bc kumrc. ‘The jussara is quite ripe now.’ Wap ja na

bra            v.intr. 1. go on foot; walk. 2. stroll. Nonfinite form: S=brar. Semantics: The semantic
               contrast between this verb as against mõ/te apparently has to do with the number of
               participants (bra being plural) as well as the specificity about going ‘on foot’ .
               Grammar: The root may cooccur with the directional/movement particle ma in the
               clause; the combination of particle and verb root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent
               in the clause, the verb root means ‘come’.

ca‡         v.intr. stand in vertical position (of one or a pair of objects or people). Nonfinite form
            and inflectional pattern: S=cm; alternating form: S=car. Semantics: The semantic
            contrast between this verb and kue appears to be that the former indicates movement
            towards standing position, whereas the latter indicates being in that position.
            However, only ca seems to occur in constructions that require position verbs,
            indicating, in this case, something already in standing position. This hypothesis is at
            odds with the morphological class of each verb and their correlation with descriptive
            and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is that the contrast may have to do with the
            number of participants, ca being the singular and kue the plural counterpart. A third
            hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be standing’, but with the semantics of kue
            focusing on the resultative aspect of getting up, and ca not having such connotation.
            Ex.: Pa na pa ca. ‘I’m standing (here).’ Ktm ca. ‘Stand up (few people).’ Na ka va
            km ca. ‘The two of you stood up.’ See kue.

c‡w´        cl. phrase-final clitic, nominalizer of agent. Grammar: This morpheme occurs in
             relative clauses indicating the relativized noun, which may be a subject or object.
             Structurally, it is placed at the end of the relative clause and is followed by the definite
             article ja, or another determiner. Its occurrence in this context appears to be optional.
             Ex.: B t cw ja na pr km apen prm. ‘The man who died enjoyed working.’ Di

da           n.al. rain.
da ac‡et     n.al.cmp. lightning. (da=a-cet ‘rain=dtrz-burn’). Alternate form: da acen. Grammar:
             The presence of the formative a- in this word makes it comparable to words such as
             amgr ‘drought; dry season’. In both cases, the base of the word is a descriptive verb.
             It might even be possible to include awjakr in the equation. Ex.: Da acet ka:pri. ‘It’s
             lightning a little.’

duj          v.dscr. bad; ugly; badly. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=p-uduj; alternate
             form: çmduj. Nonfinite form: same. Alternate form: puduju/mduju; this form does not
             occur in nonfinite position. Grammar: This verb may occur with the clause-final clitic
             ne, which expresses temporary state or condition, in this context. Ex.: Ata na mduju.
             ‘This one (over there) is bad.’ Ata na m mduj tjc kumrc. ‘That one is really
             mean!’ Na pa icpuduju. ‘I’m ugly/mean/sickly.’ Na pa icpuduj ne. ‘I look ugly/am

e            v.tr.noncan. tie; fasten. Inflectional pattern: OE=m e; no relational prefix. Grammar:
             a. One piece of evidence of the absence of a relational prefix for this verb is the
             ungrammatical form *aje (for “tie [it] up!”). b. When there is a beneficiary, the clause
             will contain two dative-marked nominals: one being the beneficiary and the other the
             dative-marked, extended O. c. This verb contrasts with pr, katpr in that it may have
             a participial reading with no change in form. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Kt paj pi
             m e. ‘I’ll fasten the lumber.’ Im iõ boc m e. ‘Tie my cow for me, will you?’ Km
             e! ‘Tie it up!’ B pip muj, na m ra km e. ‘That drunk man, they’ve tied him up.’
             B na ra km e . ‘The man is tied up, sitting.’ Pa na pa m b jaja m e  ca. ‘I’m

ec‡          v.dscr. lie; deceive; cheat; pretend. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c=ec.
             Nonfinite form: et. Grammar: This verb may occur with the dative postposition m in
             a noncanonical pattern of argument marking; in such cases the inflectional pattern is as

             a table); 2. put away one or a pair of objects. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:
             O=c-i. Nonfinite form: ir. Grammar: Allows for third person accusative prefix ku-.
             Semantics: One aspect in which this verb (and its counterpart acw contrasts with the
             pair m, ujw is that the former may refer to objects shaped in such way that would
             usually be conceived of as lying in horizontal position (e.g. forks and knives), whereas
             the latter often refer to those that could be thought of as “standing up” (e.g. bowls,
             plates, cups). On the other hand, the former pair may also refer to this same class of
             objects, but indicating that they lie upside down. Ex.: Na pa kuci ‘I’ve put it away.’
i            n.inal. bone. Inflectional pattern: PSSR=i; no relational prefix, apparently. Phonology:
             form alternates between ji and i. The former occurs after conosonant-final nouns and

                   Semantics: This verb appears to contrast with nõ in terms of number. This root is used
                   when the absolutive argument is plural. See nõ. Grammar: The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and 
                   ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in that the former seem to
                   have a more flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than
                                                                                                           381
                the latter. It is possible to find examples of m nõ and m , even though these verbs
                refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw are often not found
                with singular absolutives. Ex.: M krar jaja m ikw ne. M piget jaja acwj jaja, m
                 ne ikw. ‘The children were all lying (there). The elderly also, they were all ill and

ipecji        n.al.der. person who is characteristically known by making things. (ipec=ji
                ‘make=ag.nmlz’) Ex.: kaw´ nipec‡ j‡i ‘basket maker.’ Grammar: When ji is used with
                transitive verbs, the derived word may require the use of relational prefixes
                dependening on whether the verb root starts in a vowel.
ipetc´         n.inal.der. father. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=-ipetc. (ipet=c
                ‘make.NF=INSTR.NMLZ’).
ipok            n.inal. 1. the center of a particular space. 2. the midst (e.g. of a crowd). 3. the
                innermost area of a large location (e.g. a forest). Inflectional pattern and relational
                prefix: PSSR=n-ipok. Grammar: Due to its semantics, this noun is sometimes used
                similarly to a postposition; but its referential nature is also very clear. In cases of
                referential use, a postposition or demonstrative is likely to follow this noun, such that
                the integrity of the genitive construction (or, the NP) in which it occurs is maintained,
                thus avoiding any kind of structural ambiguity. Ex.: Pr nipok ri. ‘The center of the
                forest.’ Pr nipok. ‘In the middle of the forest.’ Kri rac nipok ri. ‘The downtown
                area.’ Kri nipok. ‘In the middle of the village.’ Kapot nipok. ‘In the middle of the
                outdoors.’ Go nipok. ‘In the middle of the river.’ Arigr nipok ri. ‘In the middle of the
                sunlight.’ [Notice the contrast in meaning between this ri-ending phrase and the ones
                above: it could be that in this phrase, the sense of the word is more one of ‘midst;
                being involved/engulfed by’, similarly to the next example.] M ipok ri. ‘In the
                middle of the crowd.’ *Na pa m ipok ca. Na pa m ipok ri ca. ‘I’m standing in the
                middle of the crowd.’ Kt poj kapot nipok kot te. ‘We’re going to the center of the

                center of the woods.’ Go nipok kot te. ‘Go to the center of the creek.’ */?Kt puj kapot

ji‡         suf.der.ag. adjective-forming suffix. Grammar: a. This suffix may attach to transitive,

            performs the action described by the verb. b. The derived form maintains the same

                 in that the word kabro operates as a plain noun, rather than presenting verbal
                 properties. Ex.: Pa na pr g bri um kabro gr t akupm kabro prõt. ‘I wet (the
                 wound) and the bleeding stopped, then the blood started running again.’ Pa na ickabro
                 rac ne. ‘I bled a lot.’ This is a nominal predicate construction; if pa were the subject,
                 it would reappear after the modality marker. But: Na iikrakr kabro  mõ. ‘I go with
                 my finger bleeding./My finger goes bleeding.’ Iikra kr kabro. ‘My finger is
                 bleeding.’

              Inflectional pattern: O=m A=kat; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: m katr.
              Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and apoj apparently has to do with
              the number of participants, kat being the singular and apoj the plural counterpart.
              Grammar: a. In the compound verb ‘wake up’, the verb roots alternate according to the
              number of the absolutive argument, thus: krkat ‘wake up (sg.)’ and krapoj ‘wake
              up (pl)’. b. The same is true when the root is used with directional postpositions such
              as wr ‘ALLT’ and m ‘DAT’. Ex.: Na pa ickat. ‘I left (the premises).’ Na pa uti
              ipok ri km ickat. ‘I found it out in the woods.’ Na pa km ickat. ‘I found this

              boys broke the glass (to my detriment).’ Na m icpe iõ kp kat. ‘They broke my

katpr        v.tr. tie; fasten. Inflectional pattern: O=katpr; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form:
              same. Grammar: a. This verb is related to pr, which seems to be a participial form of
              it. b. There are examples in which the form pr seems to occur as a nonfinite
              counterpart of katpr; in such cases, pr takes person inflection for object, and that
              contrasts with its use as a participial/resultative form.
katut         n.inal. back

                 does have a nasal vowel in this position.

kep              cop. third person form of the copula pe ‘be; become’. Grammar: The copula pe is
                 used in nominal predicate constructions, especially those expressing equative
                 predicates and true nominal predicates. It is not used in locative or possessive
                 predicates.
ket              cl. negative marker; negative existential marker. Alternate form: kete. Grammar: a.
                 This form is often used in nominal predicate constructions, although it is not restricted
                 to it. b. This negative marker is used in clauses that indicate a habitual negative, or in
                 a noun phrase that describes a negative property or habit of the head noun referent.
                 Ex.: Ja na kom kete. ‘This person doesn’t drink.’ Ja na kt gwra kago  kom kete.

               subject prefix in imperative clauses. However, this inflected form is not to be
               confused with the verb akje ‘open’. Ex.: Kri) pic‡i kam´) go kjen c‡´ ‘Only one of the

krak               v.dtr.noncan. shoot (a gun). Inflectional pattern: EO=kam [kuce]O=krak. Lexicon:
                   This verb is inherently transitive, but with an invariable O, the noun kuce ‘weapon’.
                   This noun is often ommitted in clauses containing this verb, whereas the target is often
                   overtly expressed, thus giving the impression that this is one of the many noncanonical
                   verbs of Apinajé.
krakra             v.tr. shatter; break into pieces (of things that are not necessarily long); smash.

kre)               v.tr. 1. eat food of one specific kind, regardless of the quantity. 2. swallow.
                   Inflectional pattern: O=kre; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: kre)r. Semantics: a.
                   This verb contrasts with ku ‘eat’ in that the former refers to a single type of food,
                   whereas the latter makes reference to a meal consisting of many different items. Thus,
                   the notion of number plays a role in the contrast, although it is not controlled by the
                   quantity of food as such but by the variety of the meal. Ex.: Na pa ra aroj kw´ kre)
                   ‘I’ve eaten some rice, already.’ Pa kukre. ‘I’ve swallowed it (e.g. of a pill).’ Kupe

kri)               v.dscr. 1. be seated. Inflectional pattern: S=kri; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form:
                   kri; alternate form S=krir. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb and 
                   appears to be that the latter indicates movement towards sitting position, whereas the
                   former indicates being in sitting position. However, only  seems to occur in
                   constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already in
                   sitting position. This hypothesis is at odds with the morphological class of each verb
                   and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is that
                   the contrast may have to do with the number of participants,  being the singular and
                   kri the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be sitting’, but
                                                                                                     394
          with the semantics of kri focusing on the resultative aspect of sitting down, and  not
          having such connotation. 2. v.tr. sit multiple people on a particular place. Inflectional
          pattern: O=kri; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. 3. n.al. village. Grammar:
          The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and  ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in
          that the former seem to have a more flexible use, with respect to the number
          distinction of the absolutive, than the latter. It is possible to find examples of m nõ
          and m , even though these verbs refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but
          kri and ikw are often not found with singular absolutives. Ex.: Na pa ickri. ‘I stay
          seated [in a particular place]; I live [in a particular place].’ Pa na pa m km ane um
          pip  m m akri pa ka m . ‘I told you guys to sit so you all be seated in the

ku        v.tr. eat, esp. a meal consisting of various kinds of food items. Inflectional pattern:
          O=ku; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: kur. Semantics: This verb contrasts with
          kre ‘eat’ in that the latter refers to a single type of food, whereas the former makes
          reference to a meal consisting of various food items. Thus, the notion of number plays
          a role in the contrast, although it is not controlled by the quantity of food as such but
          by the variety of the meal. Grammar: a. This verb has an intransitive counterpart
          formed by the accretion of the detransitivizing prefix aC-. b. The nonfinite form of
          the verb does not allow for the use of the accusative third person prefix ku-. c. When
          used in the context of this verb, the particle pa apparently refers back to the direct
          object, i.e. ‘all of OBJ’, rather than to the event/action described by the verb itself. Ex.:
          Kt paj kur pa. ‘I’ll eat all of it.’ Ata kur ket ne. ‘Don’t eat that.’ Na pa ra kuku.
          ‘I’ve already eaten it.’ Kaj kur pa. ‘Swallow them all (e.g. of various kinds of pills)’.
          See apku; kre.
ku–       Prfx.pron. third person accusative marker.              Grammar: a. This verb occurs
          overwhelmingly with monosyllabic verb roots. b. This prefix never occurs in
          nonfinite verb forms. c. It indexes the accusative argument of a finite transitive verb
          and the object of a postposition.
ku/e      v.dscr. stand in vertical position (of multiple objects or people). Nonfinite form and
          inflectional pattern: S-kue; no relational prefix. Semantics: The semantic contrast
          between this verb and ca appears to be that the latter indicates movement towards
          standing position, whereas the former indicates being in that position. However, only
          ca seems to occur in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case,
          something already in standing position. This hypothesis is at odds with the
                                                                                                              395
                   morphological class of each verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive
                   notions. Another hypothesis is that the contrast may have to do with the number of
                   participants, ca being the singular and kue the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis
                   is that both verbs mean ‘be standing’, but with the semantics of kue focusing on the
                   resultative aspect of getting up, and ca not having such connotation. Ex.: Pa na pa
                   ickue. ‘I stood up.’ Ka na am´) ktm´) aku/e pr´m ‘You want to stand up.’ Ktm

kw                 encl. a bit; some. Grammar: This is a quantifier for noncount nouns, esp. food. Many
                    verbs require its occurrence, and it occurs immediately preposed to the verb. It might
                    be possible to analyse it as occurring within the noun phrase immediately after the
                    noun. Nonetheless, it appears that it is the verb that requires this element, since kw
                    seems to occur most often in noun phrases in direct object position. Ex.: Kçt paj ´bri
                    me/õ kw´ kre) ‘Now I’m gonna have some food.’

                 verbs in imperatives. Ex.: Pa ra ma mõ ‘I’m going away.’ Ma ‘Go on!’

                 usually presented in a single container (e.g. a stew). 4. throw away. 5. name someone.
                 Inflectional pattern: O=me; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: The
                 use of this verb with the sense of ‘serve food’ contrasts with the verb re, with the same
                 sense, in that the former requires the quantifier kw to determine meõ, whereas the
                 latter occurs without the quantifier. One could describe the distinction also in terms of
                 mass versus count objects. Ex.: Ka na ka i¯me) ‘You threw me.’ Te ne amim meõ
                 kw me. ‘Go help yourself to the food.’ Me bra ne me amim meõ kw me. ‘Go over

mõ                v.intr. come; go. Nonfinite form: S=mõ; alternate form: mõr. Semantics: The semantic
                  contrast between this verb and te apparently has to do with the number of participants,
                  mõ being the plural and te the singular counterpart. Grammar: a. The root may
                  cooccur with the directional/movement particle ma in the clause; the combination of
                  particle and verb root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent in the clause, the verb root
                  means ‘come’. See te, bra; ma. b. This root may be used with the morpheme  in
                  what appears to be a transitive verb compound, ‘bring/take’. c. This root may be used
                  in V mõ (serial) constructions, basically expressing progressive or inchoative aspects;
                  it contrasts with te in this respect, in that the latter may not be used in many of these
                  constructions. In such cases, mõ appears to have acquired a more grammaticalized
                  meaning, whereas te is understood more literally, which makes its use inadequate.
mrõ               v.intr. dive. Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S=mrõ. Grammar: This verb
                  cannot take the derivational morpheme -ji (*mrõmji), unless it is used as a transitive
                  verb: kr mrõmji ‘one how likes to sink her/his head’. Ex.: Na pa mrõ. ‘I dove.’ Na
                  pa imrõ rac kumrc. ‘I dove for a long time.’ Na pa imrõ tjc ne. ‘I dove hard (e.g.

                  lie at the bottom of a container (e.g. starch). Nonfinite form: S=nõr. Grammar: The
                  verbs nõ ‘lie’ and  ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in that
                  the former seem to have a more flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of
                  the absolutive, than the latter. It is possible to find examples of m nõ and m , even
                  though these verbs refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw are
                  often not found with singular absolutives.
o                 n.inal. 1. leaf. 2. bodily hair. Inflectional pattern: pssr=o; no relational prefix. Exx:

                  nose’. Phonology: apparently no glottal stop before o. This is indicated especially
                  because of the phonetics at the word boundaries: [ka cdo] and [ka bero]
                                                                                                    400

õ           n.inal. belly. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=-õ. See u. Semantic
              note: As explained by speakers, the formative õ refers to inner body parts: the guts, the
              intestines, the throat (seen from within), etc. Grammar: This noun changes form
              somewhat when inflected for second person; in that case, the form is atu (a-t-u ‘2-RP-
              belly’, presumably). It is not yet clear why there is such variation. Ex.: Di ata na km
              õ c prm. ‘This woman over there always has intestinal problems.’
õji         n.der.act. One who always has intestinal problems. Ex.: Di ata na õji. ‘This woman

              not take a relational prefix. Ex.: Na pa iõjairi. ‘I vomited.’ Na m õjairi pa. ‘They
              threw up.’ Na pa mebç ja ç i¯õjai)ri) pa ‘I threw up with everything (that was in my

              Grammar: a. This verb apparently contrasts in number with ibc. b. The occurrence of
              the conclusive particle pa with this verb root indicates the end of the action; however,
              with its (presumably) plural counterpart ibc, the construction seems to be point to the
              entirety of the group of objects (i.e. “all of them”), rather than the conclusion of the
              action. Ex.: Na pa ra kupi. ‘I’ve killed it.’ Na pa ktm pir ketne. ‘I haven’t killed it
              yet.’ Na ktm icpir ketne. ‘They haven’t killed me yet.’ Na pa pir pa. ‘I’ve finished

               This verb has a bivalent counterpart in  piao. b. Although this verb does not seem to
               take inflection in either form, it does require the occurrence of the ergative marker
               when in subordinate position. Compare with piagri, in that respect. Ex.: Na pa piao.
               ‘I’m nursing.’ Na pa piao ketne. ‘I’m not nursing.’ Prir kt piao cw ja na ickra ne.
               ‘This kid that’s nursing is my child.’ See o, kao; piagri.

               kaek. Similar to the nonfinite form of aC- verbs, although atkaek is a nonexistent
               verb in the language. The semantics and use of this form is adjectival, as in a

               kaco ‘tear; rip’ and the intransitive atkaco ‘tear, rip’. The semantics and use of this
               form is adjectival, as in a participial resultative. Ex.: Na i¯õ c‡ak rE pikac‡ojn kˆn´) ‘My
               little bag is torn indeed.’

pikuke        v.prtcpl. broken into pieces. Inflectional pattern: S=pikuke. Grammar: Related to the
               transitive verb kuke ‘break into pieces’. Grammar: This is essentially a nonfinite form
               of the verb, even though it may occur in a regular finite position with no variation.
               The semantics and use of it is adjectival, as in a participial resultative. Ex.: Pipç na ra
               pikuke) (ket ne)) ‘The bench is not broken.’ Pa na ra icpikuke. ‘I’m already broken
               (of a table saying it).’ See kuke, atkuke.

               Grammar: This is essentially a nonfinite form of the verb, even though it may occur in
               a regular finite position with no variation. The semantics and use of this form is
               adjectival, as in a resultative participial. Ex.: Ict na pikw . ‘My leg is broken.’ Pa

pr         v.prtcpl. tied up. Inflectional pattern: S=pr; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form:
            same. Grammar: a. This form has the semantics of a participial resultative form, and
            follows a descriptive pattern of inflection. It is related to the verb katpr, which is a
            transitive counterpart it. b. There are examples in which the form pr seems to occur
            as a nonfinite counterpart of katpr. In such cases, pr takes person inflection for
            object, and that contrasts with its use as a participial/resultative form. Ex.: Kt paj
            akatpr. ‘I will tie you up.’ Im ickrkrac  tjc pa katpr. ‘Keep it steady against the
            wall for me (so that) I tie it up.’ Na pa m katpr pa. ‘I tied them up.’ Na m ra pitt

prek             v.dscr. tall. Inflectional pattern: S=prek; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same.
                 Phonology: The final consonant of this verb is realized as a compensatory lengthening
                 of the root vowel when it is followed by another consonant. If that consonant happens
                 to be the coronal stop /t/, another effect is that the coronal will be realized as voiced.
                 Ex.: B prekti muj na ibjen ja. ‘That tall man is my husband.’ Pa na pa t pai prek
                 kot icpa kete. ‘I don’t walk with tall people.’ Na b prek di. ‘The man is tall.’

                Nonfinite form: same. Phonology: The initial consonant of the verb is realized as the
                lateral alveolar approximant [l] in the context of a preceding coronal. Thus, /it-r/ is
                produced [il]. Notice that there is no vowel length, which suggests the alternative
                hypothesis that it is the coronal vowel itself which is conditioning the alternation. Ex.:
                M pa jaja na pa m pr ne arik um m kwr jaja na m ir ne m ma apec. ‘As for
                us, we were left behind and stayed, the others left us and went away.’ Kt ja ir. ‘S/he

rac‡            adv.1. intensifier. 2. adj. large. 3. qtf. much. No inflection. Semantics: The use of rac,
                as well as ru, seems to imply that the predicator being modified encodes a permanent
                property. Both these intensifiers contrast with tjc in this respect, which is used with
                predicators encoding transitional or temporary conditions/states. Phonology: This
                morpheme is realized as [lac] if following a coronal sound — vowel or consonant.
                Grammar: a. This morpheme is used to modify verbs and nouns. There is no evidence
                                                                                                     408
            that it follows the inflectional pattern of descriptives. b. It may, in turn, be modified as
            well (e.g. by the morpheme kumrc). c. This intensifier is compatible with words
            derived by -ji, in contrast with the intensifier ru, which is not. d. There is evidence
            which indicates that, if used with a transitive verb, this morpheme may refer to the
            quantity of the direct object, rather than serve as an intensifier of the verb. Ex.: Go rac
            ‘river (water=large)’. Na ra im bc rac kumrc. ‘(Things) are really good for me.’
            Ickengrji rac ne. ‘I’m really easy to get tired.’ Na pa icpuduj rac ne. ‘I’m really

            pattern: O=re; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: The use of this
            verb with the sense of ‘serve food’ contrasts with the verb me, with the same sense, in
            that the latter requires the quantifier kw to determine meõ, whereas the former occurs
            without the quantifier. One could describe the distinction also in terms of mass versus
            count objects. Ex.: Me ac‡w´j jaja apen kr´) ti re) ‘They are also going to play (with
            the mangaba ball).’ Ma te ne amim meõ re. ‘Go help yourself to the food.’ Me ma bra

ru)        adv. 1. intensively; repetitively. 2. adj. plenty. 3. grand. Phonology: This morpheme is

            vowel or consonant. Semantics: The use of ru, as well as rac, seems to imply that the
            predicator being modified encodes a permanent property. Both these intensifiers
            contrast with tjc in this respect, which is used with predicators encoding transitional
            or temporary conditions/states. Grammar: This intensifier is not compatible with
            words derived by -ji, and thus it contrasts with the intensifiers rac and tjc, which are
            used in those cases. Ex.: Mõkrpoj ruti ‘name of a traditional festival’

t´jc‡       adv. 1. intensifier. 2. adj. hard; tense, stiff, rigid; robust. 3. fast. No evidence of
            inflection. Nonfinite form: t´jt. Semantics: The use of tjc seems to imply that the
            predicator being modified encodes a transitional or temporary condition/state. This
            intensifier contrasts with ru and rac in this respect, since these seem to be used with
            predicators encoding permanent properties. Grammar: a. This morpheme is used to
            modify predicates. In its turn, it may be modified by the intensifier kumrc. b. This
            morpheme has a descriptive counterpart, itjc. Ex.: Ibut tjc. ‘My neck is tense.’ Na
                                                                                                           410

                demonstrative with a second person as the deictic center, atar ‘over there (close to
                you)’. In the second case, the resulting form is a distal demonstrative, mujtar ‘over
                there (far away from us)’. There are no examples available in which tar occurs with a
                first person prefix.

te ti           n.al.aug. insect (sp.), Port.: carrapato.
te)             v.intr. come; go. Nonfinite form: S=tem. Semantics: The semantic contrast between
                this verb and te apparently has to do with the number of participants, mõ being the
                plural and te the singular counterpart. Grammar: a. The root may cooccur with the
                directional/movement particle ma in the clause; the combination of particle and verb
                root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent in the clause, the verb root means ‘come’.
                                                                                                     411
                See mõ, bra; ma. b. This root may be used with the causative (?) morpheme  in what
                appears to be a transitive verb compound, ‘bring/take’. c. This root contrasts with mõ,
                in that the latter may be used in V mõ constructions, whereas the former has limited
                distribution in this respect. In such constructions, mõ appears to have acquired a more
                grammaticalized meaning (progressive; inchoative), whereas te is understood more
                literally, which makes its use inadequate.

            something; drop. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=m A=-r. Nonfinite
            form: same. Phonology: a. In the context of a following vowel, an epenthetic flap [r]
            separates the two, as in arr  mõ. b. There is root-initial vowel alternation between
            [u, ], such that [u] occurs in initial position (although it may fluctuate with [ ], in this
            position) and [ ] occurs systematically after the relational prefix. This process is
            observable in other verbs as well. Usage: This verb is used by older generation
            speakers with the sense desciberd in 2, whereas younger speakers tend to use the verb
            kaga, instead. Ex.: Na ka ra im arr  mõ. ‘You’re already leaving me.’ Na km

            the ground, right-side up. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-ujw.
            Nonfinite form: ujw.. Semantics: This verb (as well as its counterpart m) is used
            with reference to objects shaped in such a way that allow the speaker to conceive of
            them as “standing up”, such as plates or cups. Its use would be more problematic with
            objects such as forks and knives, for instance, since these kinds of objects are typically
            laid in horizontal position. Ex.: Kt paj amim meõ kuw kam ujw. ‘I’m going to put
            my foods on the fire.’ Na pa ra amim iõ prat ne iõ kpti cujw. ‘I’ve already set

ukrarkr       v.dscr.cmp. belch (with an offensive odor). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:
               S=c-ukrarkr; alternate form: S=p-krarkr. Grammar: The inflected form of this verb
               alternates between cukrarkr and pkrarkr. This may be a case of innovation in the
               making from one pattern to the other. It is possible that, for the basic form of the verb,
               presumably ukra, the use of one of the relational prefixes is steady, with no
               alternations. But this hypothesis needs to be verified in future research, as there are no
               occurrences of the basic verb stem in the database as it is. Ex.: Pa na pa icukrarkr.
               ‘I’m burping.’ Na ka acukrarkr. ‘You are burping.’ Ne na ukrarkr. ‘This one is

up´m           v.dscr. deep. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c-up´m. Nonfinite form:

               morpheme . b. The occurrence of the relational prefix in this descriptive does not
               seem to correspond to a difference between attributive and predicative positions, as is
               the case with jakr ‘cold’, for instance. Ex.: Na pka kr cupm. ‘The whole on the

/o            v.tr. 1. suck on a piece of fruit (e.g. mango); ingest juicy foods (e.g. honey). 2. drink
              the juice extracted from fruits or plants. Inflectional pattern: O=o; no relational
              prefix. Nonfinite form: O=or. Semantics: This verb contrasts with its counterpart kao
              in that the latter refers specifically to the act of sucking the juice out of a fruit, e.g. an
              orange. Grammar: usually employs the quantifier kw when O is a mass noun. Ex.:
              Na pa manti o. ‘I ate the mangoes.’ Ma:di o tjc ne. ‘I sucked the mango hard (until
              I got all the pulp off from it).’ See kao2, piao.

              and relational prefix: O=c-r. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Na pa iõ br cr  ca. ‘I’m
              roasting my meat.’ Na pa ktm r  ca. ‘I’m still roasting (it).’ Na grEri kr´)ˆrE c‡´n
              ne ç kuc‡wa t´jc‡ kumrEc‡ ‘Dada put the chicken to cook and now it smells good!’
              Phonology: The basic form of the verb assimilates to the environment and is realized
              as [cn ], as it precedes the conjunction ne. 2. v.intr. roast; cook; grill. Inflectional
              pattern and relational prefix: S=c-r. Ex.: w, na ra ´r´ ‘Yes, it is roasted.’ Na ktm
              r  ca. ‘It’s still cooking.’ Na ktm meõ r  ca. ‘The food is still cooking.’

√r            v.dscr. enter. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c- r; alterate form: r .
              Nonfinite form: same. Semantics: It appears this verb does not participate in the
              number opposition that characterizes the verb pair ac/agje, in which the former is the
              singular counterpart and the latter the plural one. Ex.: Na pa ra ic r . ‘I went in.’ Na
              t ri akupm r pr k. ‘Looks like it went in again.’ Ma, ata ra m kapot  ca t na m

ˆr          v.tr. cut off; remove; pick (of fruit). Inflectional pattern: O=r; no relational prefix.
            Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Na pa ra iõ pico r ‘I’ve already cut off my banana
            (bunch).’ Na pa iõ pico r kaciw ‘I’m abou to get my bananas.’ Na pa iõ pico r 
            ca ‘I’m getting my bananas.’
r          v.tr. weave. Inflectional pattern: O= ; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: O=r. Ex.:
            Na pa itkupip  ‘I wove my mat.’ Na pa itkupip r   ‘I’m weaving my mat.’
çrçr        v.intr.evnt. come to a boil. Ex: Kt paj ami m kuw kam meõ cm, um rt, um
            kao pa kukre. ‘I’m going to put my food on the fire, it will come to a boil, then it will
            be ready for me to it.’
´t          n.inal. box. P.ex. me pri) m´) ´t aNõ me ç amni) kati ‘Give the box to the children for

           v.tr. 1. place one object or a pair of objects of the same kind (e.g. a pair of sandals)
            into a deep recipient (e.g. a basket, a box, or a bag). 2. serve food (as a mass concept)
            in a deep container (e.g. a bowl). Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: O=c-.
            Nonfinite form: r. Semantics: This verb contrasts with such others as me, re and gje
            on the basis of the category of number, among other details. Morphology: The verb 
            ‘serve’ is almost homophonous with the verb r ‘cook’, except that the former has a
            different finite form and a relational prefix, and the latter has the same form in both
            finite and nonfinite positions, and it has no relational prefix. Ex.: Na ktm meõ kw
            cr  ca. ‘She is still serving herself to some food.’ Te ne amim meõ kw c ne ip
            amim meb ata kw re. ‘Go help yourself to some food, get yourself some of these
            things over there.’ Pa iõ kp icm ketne. ‘I’m not going to set my cup (e.g. at the
            table).’ See re, me, gje.
 krikrit   v.tr.der. 1. race someone. 2. run after someone. Inflectional pattern and relational
            prefix: O=t- A=krikrit. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: In this form, the morpheme
             takes a relational prefix. Ex.: Na prti brekr  krikrit um ubaj prõt. ‘The truck
            raced after the seriema and it ran out of fear.’ Ict akrikrit ketne. ‘Don’t run after me.’
            Na wa atpen t krikrit. ‘The two of them are racing each other.’ Na ka wa atpen t
            akrikrit ketne. ‘The two of you are not racing one another.’ See krikrit.
¯ˆ)         v.intr. sit. Nonfinite form: S=r. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb
            and kri appears to be that the former indicates movement towards sitting position,
            whereas the latter indicates being in sitting position. However, only  seems to occur
            in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already
            in sitting position. This hypothesis is at odds with the morphological class of each
            verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is
            that the contrast may have to do with the number of participants,  being the singular
            and kri the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be sitting’,
            but with the semantics of kri focusing on the resultative aspect of sitting down, and 
            not having such connotation. Grammar: a. This verb is used in VV constructions,
            indicating progressive or continuative aspect. b. The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and  ‘sit’ contrast
            with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in that the former seem to have a more
            flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than the latter. It
                                                                                                  421
        is possible to find examples of m nõ and m , even though these verbs refer
        basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw are often not found with
        singular absolutives. Ex.: Pip  muj  . ‘Sit on that bench.’ See r, kri.
ˆ)r     v.tr. sit one person or two people on a particular place. Inflectional pattern and
        relational prefix: O=-r. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Ja mu atõ pip  r. ‘Sit your
        brother on that stool.’ Pip ata  r ketn d pip ata mduju, ra pikuke. ‘Don’t sit
        him on this bench [near you] because it is bad, it is broken.’ D , pa ict  ar kete.
        ‘No, it wasn’t me who sat you on it.’ Kj pu m mõ km r. ‘Let’s go and lift her/the
        two of them (such that she/they stay seated).’ See , kri.
kure   v.dscr. 1. intolerant; feisty; quarrelsome. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix:
        S=c=kure. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Ne na t kure  kri. ‘That one is feisty.’ Pa
        na ickure. ‘I’m feisty.’ 2. v.tr.noncan. resent someone; be upset with someone.
        Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: EO=kam S=c-kure. Nonfinite form: same.
        Ex.: Na pa akam ickure. ‘I’m upset with you.’ See  kure; kure.
m      v.tr. 1. place one or a pair of objects right-side up on a surface (e.g. table, counter or
        ground). 2. place (a pot or pan of food) on the fire so as to cook. Inflectional pattern
        and relational prefix: O=c-m. Nonfinite form: same. Semantics: This verb (as well as
        its counterpart ujw) is used with reference to objects shaped in such a way that allow
        the speaker to conceive of them as “standing up”, such as plates or cups. Its use would
        be more problematic with objects such as forks and knives, for instance, since these
        kinds of objects are typically laid in horizontal position. Ex.: Kt paj ami m kuw
        kam meõ cm, um rt, um kao pa kukre. ‘I’m putting my food on the fire, then it

        ‘That one refuses to set it up.’ Kj pu km m. ‘Let’s lift it (such that it stands right-
        side up).’ See ujw, i.

       Here, a new token of the modality marker na in the second clause suggests thatcause and result are expressed by two independent sentences. It should be pointed out,however, that my consultant considered the sentence (94) somewhat odd; such aconstruction could only be found in an elicitation situation. The reason for the oddity isprobably the fact that the higher agent here is an event, and not a participant. A more

The resultclause is not a complement of  ane but rather in a paratactic relation with it (literally:“you did me this way, I [V]”); in addition, the accusative argument of  ane ‘do thus’must be coreferential with the first argument of the result clause. Differences in thestructure of a periphrastic causative correlate with the human-ness/volitionality of thecauser: if that argument is not an inherently volitional being, the first clause is linked tothe second one by the conjunction ne.

Morphological causative. The morphological causative is characterized by theoccurrence of  ‘causative’ preposed to the lexical verb of a clause. Even though stresspatterns indicate that  is not a prefix on the verb, the  V complex may be regarded as acompound, since no intervening elements are allowed between the two morphemes.","[277, 278, 279]"
"       On the other hand, for any of these clause types, the expression of negation is notaffected by the mode (realis or irrealis) or speech-act (declarative, interrogative,imperative) distinction of the clause.",[263]
"        Serialization requires the nonfinite form of verbs when the (causative orinstrumental morpheme) verb  ‘do’ is involved. Otherwise, it is just the bare form ofverbs that occur in a sequence; in this case, the verbs involved are usually from the classof intransitives (i.e. they take no inflection in their finite form). In Apinajé, serializationalways involves either a movement verb or a position verb. Not all verbs belonging toeach category are eligible for serial constructions expressing aspectual meanings, butonly a selected few. When verbs from outside this inventory are used, the resultingoverall meaning of the construction is more literal than grammatical, sometimes yieldingawkward or jocose meanings.

       General criteria used for deciding whether these clauses or predicators in asequence all belong in a single complex syntactic unit are of three kinds: prosodic,morphological, and syntactic. From the prosodic point of view, the elements of eachcomplex construction belong within a single sentential intonation contour.","[289, 290]"

"       In the analysis of Apinajé, I share Matthew Dryer’s view that the grammaticalrelations of a language are specific to that language and may be defined according tolanguage internal criteria. In section 3.3 I have pointed out how distinct systems ofalignment interact in Apinajé. Thus, coding patterns and control properties relevant forthe establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé include:(82) Relevant criteria for the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé   (a) word order
   (b) person prefixes
   (c) independent pronouns
   (d) person inflection in imperative clauses
   (e) the use of reflexives
   (f) the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination

   (i) ergative marking in subordinate clauses
   (j) equi-deletion in complementation
   (k) coreferential deletion in coordination

Genitive õ. The genitive marker õ behaves very much like other postpositions ofApinajé.
                                                                                               141

            ‘My beans are inside my covered pan.’           Traditionally, the marker of alienable possession o has been analyzed in many Jêlanguages as the noun for ‘thing’ (cf. e.g. Ribeiro (2004) and references therein). Eventhough this may be true from a diachronic point of view, evidence indicates thatsynchronically this is not the case in Apinajé. This morpheme õ – not to be confused withthe indefinite article õ – is limited in distribution to genitive constructions: it does notoccur anywhere as an independent lexical item. In addition, there are other words thatpresently encode the meaning ‘thing’: bj ‘thing’ and kukre ‘belongings’ (76.a-b).

            ‘S/he broke all my things [to my detriment].’
Dative m. The dative postposition m also indicates the benefactive and may operate asallative or locative, as is crosslinguistically common. Besides occurring with nounphrases, the dative postposition is also used as a subordinator in purpose clauses (sectionIV.2.2).
                                                                                        142
        The third person form of this marker presents a morphological peculiarity,however.     If the referent is expressed by a full noun phrase, then the postpositionmaintains its bare form and co-occurs with the noun, which is in consonance with thebehavior of other postpositions (77.a). On the other hand, with a pronominal third personreferent, the form is km (77.b).

3.4.2. Equative predicates
                                                                                         244
Equative predicates functionally express a one-to-one identity relation between twospecific, referential entities, as in “I am Sam” or “I am your sister.” A structuraldifference between the juxtaposition construction employed here and the one expressingproper inclusion is that here a personal prefix on the predicate noun indicates thepossessor, and not the subject. The subject is encoded rather by a free pronoun, althoughits order relative to the mood marker remains reversed as compared to verbal clauses: thepronoun occurs clause-initially, and not in second position.(65) a. pa    na     a-prõ
       1      RLS    2-wife
       ‘I’m your wife.’
     b. ka    na    i-bje
        2     RLS   1-husband
       ‘You’re my husband.’
       Equative predicates by juxtaposition differ structurally from descriptive andverbal clauses primarily with respect to the relative order of the mood marker and thepronoun, and, specifically with respect to descriptives, because the prefix on thepredicator is not coreferential with the subject of the clause.","[257, 258]"
"Certain properties commonly found in subordinating constructions, such as the use of thenonfinite form of verbs, are also necessarily employed in the expression the comparativeof superiority and one type of inchoative construction. The structural properties observedin the latter cases, which are typologically less common, are crystallized and presumablyresult from the diachronic development of source biclausal constructions, in which themodern main verb was subordinate and the modern postverbal particle was the main verb.",[288]

Noun-Noun-Verb Stems. Compounds consisting of one verbal element and more thanone nominal element may display distinct internal structuring. In (33.a), the phrase tjapje ‘long leg’ characterizes pu ‘bug’, as does the augmentative clitic ti. In (33.b), kratk ‘waist cover’ displays genitive organization, being modified by r.

Noun-Postposition-Noun Stem. Some compounds consist of a postpositional phrase-likeconstruction which is subordinated to a nominal element. In this context, the groupheaded by the dative postposition indicates purpose.(34)    d=m=kc                          ‘eyeglasses’

Verb-Postposition Stem.

3.   Word classesThe present section is about the content and function words of Apinajé: how theycategorize and how this categorization is expressed in structural terms, among otherthings. The discussion is organized in terms of lexical categories and grammaticalcategories. Lexical categories include nouns, verbs, postpositions and adverbials –mostly open classes (section 3.1). Grammatical categories are pronouns and clitics thatencode various grammatical meanings – words that consitute closed classes (section 3.2).","[117, 118, 119, 120]"
"        An independent hypothesis for why ket and kot display a property characteristic ofcontent words is that both, particle and postposition, must derive historically from contentwords – a verb and a noun, respectively (chapter III). The occurrence of echo-vowelsmay be one feature that indicates their diachronic origin.

IntroductionThe present chapter discusses those construction types that encompass more than onepredicator within a single syntactic unit. Arguments are typically shared, but that may notnecessarily be the case. In functional terms, what I will be discussing here are thedomains of (a) complementation, understood, in the sense of Noonan (1985), as acomplex structure involving a clause that serves as argument of a matrix verb; (b)relativization, a clause that serves as modifier of a head noun, thus belonging within anoun phrase; (c) adverbial clauses, those expressing contextual or circumstantialinformation that serves as a frame for the main event described by the matrix verb, that is,clauses that modify a verb phrase or clause; (d) constructions expressing aspectualmeanings, such as the inchoative, the progressive, and the continuous; and (e) thecomparative of superiority. Causative constructions, discussed in section IV.5.2, alsoconstitute one type of complex construction in Apinajé, since they are expressed by thetypes of syntactic strategies described here.","[286, 287]"

        The noun acwj ‘likewise’ is, structurally speaking, the head of a noun phrase,possessed by ic-kra in the examples below. Acwj behaves morphosyntactically as aninalienable noun. It takes person prefixes and may be followed by determiners such asthe definite marker ja. In other words, not only does it belong in the noun phrase, itheads it (38).

"4.2. ImperativesIn imperative clauses, bound person inflection also displays a nominative pattern, in whatseems to be a unique occurrence of this pattern for person marking in Apinajé (85-87). In(85.a), the O argument of the verb is overtly expressed, forming a phrase with it. In(85.b), the O argument is not overtly mentioned, in which case, the verb inflects for A.",[271]
"          Consider the examples in (20). In (a), the regular use of the verb t in a simpleclause is illustrated. In (b-c), the lexical verbs of each clause co-occur with the sequence mõ ‘do go’ and  nõ ‘do lie’, respectively. The lexical verb appears in its nonfiniteform, as already mentioned, whereas the other two verbs appear without any sort ofinflection whatsoever. Both examples (20.b-c) encode the progressive aspect.(20) a. na        pa     t.

          In examples (20) as well as (21-22), we notice the use of the verb mõ ‘go’ withlexical verbs of varied semantic nuances, such as ‘die’, ‘disappear’ and ‘mature’. This

fact demonstrates that the meaning of the movement verb is not literal, although it mustbe compatible with the semantics of the lexical verb to some extent. It indicates ametaphorical transition from a previous stage to a new one: from life to death, fromappearance to disappearance, from green to ripe.(21)    ka     na     ka      ra     ic-pe a-pikudr                        mõ

        Compared to (20.b) and (21-22), it is possible to note that similar constructionsinvolving position verbs focus more on the activity being performed, ‘cry’, ‘fasten’,‘dance’ (23), rather than the result accomplished after the activity has been concluded.

        Not all movement verbs are eligible for appearing in this construction type, asthey yield literal rather than grammatical meanings. Thus, the verb te ‘go’ in (24.a)indicates the actual movement of the participant as s/he fastens the wood sticks; that is,
                                                                                             295
there are two simultaneous actions going on. Comparatively, the examples in (24.b),involving the dative postposition m in place of the morpheme , indicates literalmovement towards the locus of an action.

       Some alternative hypotheses are possible for the analysis of the morpheme  inthis context, since this marker appears in various positions with distinct meanings, in thegrammar of the language. One hypothesis could be that  is the instrumental postpositionin the examples above, and that would even justify the nonfiniteness of the precedingverb; after all, in order for it to be the object of a postposition, it must be more nominalthan verbal – and that is what nonfinite verb forms are, in Apinajé.","[307, 308, 309]"
"           A brief examination of data from Apinajé, Suyá, Kayapó and Timbira may reveal the many differences (e.g. prenasalized stops, nominative case-marking in independent clauses) and similarities (e.g. simple morphology, SOV word order, ergative marking in subordinate clauses) existing among them. Panará, on the other hand, is dramatically distinct from the other languages of the branch. It displays a more polysynthetic morphological typology, with agent, patient and tense/aspect/modality (TAM) marking on the verb; ergative marking in independent clauses and SVO word order, among other things.18

     The area is known in Brazil as “Bico do Papagaio” (‘the parrot’s beak’).

   In an interview on this subject, an Apinajé speaker declared his total lack of familiarity with the latter
terms. Most interesting in this case would be to check on the word for ‘tip, corner’ in any of the Timbira
languages.

 Data examined are from Alves (2002), Timbira Apanjekrá; Reis Silva (2003) and Salanova (2001),
Mebengokre Kayapó; Santos (2004), Suyá; and Dourado (2001), Panará.

       The Apinajé are considered, in the anthropological literature, a Western divisionof the Timbira, living west of the Tocantins. Eastern Timbira peoples are thosedistributed at various locations in the States of Maranhão and Tocantins, east of the river(Nimuendajú 1983; Da Matta 1982). In linguistic classifications, on the other hand, it isnot uncommon for an Apinajé-Kayapó grouping to be contrasted with the Timbiradialectal cluster (Davis 1966; 1968). Be that as it may, the conclusion in both fields isthat the Apinajé constitute an autonomous group and language, distinct from bothKayapó and Timbira.","[41, 42]"
"There seems to be no restrictions as far as the occurrence of noncanonical predicates incomplement positions either. Under coreferentiality conditions, all relevant arguments aremarked with person prefixes on the verb and the postposition, as applicable. However, noindependent pronouns occur in the subordinate clause, that is, there is A/S coreferentialdeletion. On the other hand, when there is no coreferentiality between A and/or S of bothclauses, the occurrence of the ergative marker in the subordinate clause is obligatory.

4.8. Conclusions       At this point, sufficient evidence has converged to argue for a convincinggrammatical category of Subject, a morphologically heterogeneous category that is unitedby syntactic behaviors. In future research, this category might become even stronger, asthe database lacked examples of noncanonical predicates with noun phrase coordination,in sentences that engage the switch reference system, and in valency-changingderivations. In any of these, the noncanonical A arguments might share yet one moresyntactic pattern with the canonical A.","[285, 286]"

IntroductionFor the unacquainted observer, Apinajé may appear as a morphologically plain languageof the analytic kind, consisting of rather short words, and having much of its grammaticalcategories expressed by function words rather than bound morphemes. That impressionis justified: Apinajé morphemes are monosyllabic indeed, and the grammaticalcategories found in the language are often expressed by function words that may or maynot be phonologically dependent, or by syntactic constructions that often times employ asubset of these very function words.","[94, 95]"
"        The fact that Postposition is viewed here as a lexical category might seem at oddswith the fact that postpositions are function words. However, even though a clear set ofstandard postpositions (monosyllabic, high frequency of use, with more grammatical thanlexical meaning) does exist in the language, other members of this category seem morelike postpositions-in-the-making, evolving from a class of nouns that I will term here“relator nouns.” For that reason, it is almost innaccurate to speak of postpositions inApinajé as constituting a closed class; perhaps this might be best described as a “halfwayopen” class.",[153]
