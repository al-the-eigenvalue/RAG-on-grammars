All the forms noted belong to the formal series.
The forms with tep-ftepa- are distinguished from the forms with
zero/a-/aj- in that they express a negative question:

A division into non-mood forms and mood forms does not occur here.
I did find a number of informal forms: these, however, do' not form
a complete paradigm. I n addition, I found in the texts a few cases of
informal interrogative forms characterized by the suffix -an. My in-
formants, however, always used a construction with the question
marker en/an in interrogative sentences,('Paradigms:    see p. 112)The verb e / j -to do, when- linked with a form of category 3 (core-&),

NegationsOnly the following forms of the verb can precede negations :
1. the m-/mV- and the m-/mV-@ forms :
2. the tense and tense-aspect categories of verbs of which the core
contains the formative por == to wish, to try to. These verbal forms
only occur in combination with @k/pak, opO~s.l/powand @nakdw/
pZnakhw. These negations then express a contrariness which can be
translated by : but no, but in vain.opdk/pak    not, without
ufidk and pak alternate freely, except after verbs with the formative
for, where opik always occurs. pak was usually found after the m-/mV-
and the m-/wtV-dji forms of the verb; in other cases op6k was usually
found.opdk/pak can form groups with :
the m-fmV- forms of the verb: m@or pdk embf            I did not see it;
                                  see not /did   I/

The distribution of o    m and pow is parallel to that of opdk and pak.
I could not find a distinct difference in meaning between o$hk/pak and
o p h / p o w . I got the impression from the examples to hand that the
relationship between opdk/pak and opow/pow is parallel to that
between the non-mood and the mood forms of the verb. opow/pow
was only found in direct speech, in sentences in which the speaker
gives expression to varying moods.op6w/pow was found linked to :

238
I shall now deal with a number of words that have no rnorpho'logical
valence and which cannot yet be classified into a definite word-class
because the material is insufficient for this purpose. That I have,
nevertheless, divided them into negations and postpositions is due to
the fact that the negations, at least, have a feature common to them,
one which is not found in the postpositions : only specific forms of the
verb can occur before negations. The feature characteristic of the
postpositions is that they always occur at or within the end of a
word-group.43
The syntactical valence of the negations and postpositions, like that
of the interrogatives, is still not fully known to me. In so far as I have
been able to determine it with certainty will it be mentioned, and
examples will be given.
In additioln, cases will also be given of the occurrence of negations and
postpositions in sentences of which the syntactical structure has not
yet been determined.","[175, 176]"

                          THE ASMAT LANGUAGE7 Tape recording  A portable tape recorder was used extensively for the collecting
of the language data and the music. Thus texts and music could always
be got without difficulty. Only once was I requested not to record
a sacred song. The Asmat people were delighted to hear their own
music reproduced. Western music meant nothing to them. They were
not much interested in the texts, though this did not alter the fact that
the audience always listened critically and expressed their disapproval
in a very positive fashion of any deviations from the version they knew.
   The analysis of the texts collected appeared to be of great value for
an understanding of the language and it was through these that I came
upon the track of the special forms of the Asmat verb which express
varying moods.
   The language of the folk tales would not appear to differ from
common usage. Asmat songs, however, have their own vocabulary
which is known only to the older people, particularly the singers.
These latter were, however, less inclined to be con~municativeabout
it to strangers.","[19, 20]"
"12 The habitual category13s
This category, like categories 13 to 15, inclusive, and 18 to 21, inclusive,
is a tense-aspect category with separate characteristics of form for
indicating time and aspect. In this category, as in the two previous
categories, a series of formal and a series of informal forms occur.
These two series are, in addition, opposed to a third series of forms
which express a particular mood of the speaker, such as, for example :
joy, excitement, vexation, disappointment. These forms I shall call
mood forms. The formal and the informal forms are, in this respect,
neutral. I n addition, a few interrogative forms were noted. These occur
only in the traditional stories. I get the impression that they have an
archaic character. Outside the traditional tales, I found in questions only
the non-interrogative forms, followed by the question marker en/an.17136
(Paradigms: see pp. 94-95)
I noted the following interrogative forms :
     1. t e t h - c e m a m   shall I give him
       3. t e t h - c W n &            will you give him

The opposition formal - informal does not, therefore, occur if the core

Tense suffix: from a comparison with the forms of category 13, it
appears that here the time suffix is zero.

-p occurs in all forms, except when the object suffix and the subject
suffix are zero'; in that case, -@ occurs.

The syntactical valence of the interrogatives is still not fully known

                               TEXTSINTRODUCTIONRecording and presentation
The ten stories presented here are only a selection of tho'se recorded
on tapes. Eight of the sttories were narrated by youths of 14 to 17 years
of age and the recording's were made either at my house in Agats or
in my house in Jepkm. One story, (VI), was tolid by a woman and was
recorded in her own house and one, (X), narrated by an older man,
was recorded in the ceremonial house.
During the narration, the speaker sat cross-legged on the ground on
a sleeping mat, according to Asmat custom. And, since the stories
were being told to an audience, the hand microphone, on its holder,
was placed on the ground in front of the narrator. A number of
listeners were always present during the recording sessions. The
speaker was only interrupted during the telling of the story when a
new tape had to be put on.
The recorded stories were later transcribed and translated with the
help of my informants. For the transcripts, they repeated the stories
word by word, and the translating of each story was only done when
the transcription had been completed.
The stories have been presented - as far as it has been practicable
to do sol - as they were told by the narrators : recapitulations, anaco-
lutha, corrections made by the speakers, sudden changes of theme, and
asides have been retained. Any errors of speech which, in my opinion,
were a hindrance to1 the understanding' of the texts have been deleted.
The transcripts given here are based on the word-by-word repetition
of the stories by my informants, who' sometimes deviated from the
original by using another word-variant, or another word, or by using
an Asmat word instead of a Malay word used by the narrator. In these
cases the word used by the latter is given in a note.
To facilitate the reading of the texts these have been divided into
relatively short paragraphs. One paragraph of the Asmat text corres'-
ponds to one paragraph of the translation. If any notes occur in a
                                   TEXTS                                 181paragraph, these have been put at the end of it. For technical reasons
the notes to the Asmat text as well as the notes to the translation have
been added to the Asmat text.
The spelling of the texts is phonematic ; the special phonological sounds
are written as shown in $ 32, note. The accent is always indicated.
The x indicates the sound made by striking the cupped hand with
the fist. The narrators sometimes did this when the passage dealt with
chopping, striking, spearing, or when they wanted to indicate a thud
o r a crack, o r a sudden start of an action. Since the striking of the
cupped hand with 'the fist often whollly o r partly took the place of a
verbal description, i,t seemed advisable to indicate this sound in the
transcription. A sentence such as : Taweric amds . . . 'Taweric sago' . . .
cannot be understood unless the accompanying sounds made by the
narrator are represented: Taweric amds x A- x x 'Taweric chopped
down sago palms'.
In addition, the following punctuation-marks will be used :
the comma, to indicate a nail-final pause in the speech of the narrator;
the full stop, to' indicate a final pause, after a noii-exclamatory sentence ;
the ex~larnatio~n    mark, to indicate a final pause after an exclamatory
sentence ;
the dash, to indicate a sudden change of theme;
quotation marks, to indicate statements in direct speech.
 No. capital letters will be used, except for proper names.","[190, 191, 192, 193]"

2. The demonstrative class
220
This class consists of the demonstrative pronoun e/er, the neutral
pronoun afar and the three demonstrative pronouns without variants :
ja, jdka and dtar.
                                  A
The A variant was always found, except in the following cases; in
these, the B variant occurred exclusively:
1. as the single word in a sentence :
   ar here; er there.
2. linked to the directional pronouns :
   or or this way; i r or that way, over there,
3. linked to:
      a r h (5 245) dr draw this is it; here it is.
      & ardw that is it.
      nms2rim      &r Â¥mas2ri        and next ; and then
      ?$in%        ir~ziw             a little bit to that side
      f i c i r i m d r picirim       to here (and no further).
Cases in which the demonstrative pronoun was linked to en, pen, am
or uw, were not met with in the material I worked on.
4. before the final a which occurs in exclamations: era! hey, there!222
a/or     points to:
1. that which is by, or in the direct neighbourhood of the speaker:
   a fir cu serdpmodmd

Syntactical valence 31 of the verbs181
Provisionally, the following can be said about the syntactical valence
of the verbs :
1. it would appear that all verbs can be linked with substantives.,
proper names, personal pronouns and demonstrative pronouns;
2. it would appear that the only time that there can be a linkage
verb  +  verb is in the verbal word-groups which are to be discussed
in paragraphs 182 and 183 ;
3. the word-group interrogative       +
                                     verb was only found with, forms of
the categories 10, 12-17 inclusive, 20, 21, 22 and 24 ;
4. only the forms of categories 4 and 5 (m-/mV-; m-/mV- -diji) can
form word-groups with negations.","[135, 136, 137]"

complete paradigm with rather great certainty. The forms not found

by quoting the number of the paragraph in brackets. This has been
done when: 1. a word has a form which deviates from the one that
would be expected according to the rules given in the grammar;

All the forms noted belong to the formal series.
The forms with m-fmV- are distinguished from the forms without
a prefix, or with a-/aj- in that they are used when the speaker explains
or interprets something, or when he makes a confirmatory statement
to himself. These forms I shall call explicative fo'rms (see $ 111).

   Now that this book is finished the time has come for me tot express
my indebtedness to those who have made it possible. My first
acknowledgement is to the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek
van de Tropen (WOTRO), formerly the Stichting Wetenschappelijk
Onderzoek Nieuw-Guinea (WONG), The Hague, for making available
to me the money to enable me to carry out fieldwork in linguistics
for a period of two years in West New Guinea and, in addition, for
making it possible for me to devote myself exclusively on my return
to working on the material I had assembled. I owe a particular debt
to the Treasurer of the Stichting, Dr J. H. Westerrnann for his
continued and stimulating interest in the progress of the work.
   I am grateful to the Board of Directors of the Koninklijk Instituut
voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, The Hague, for their kindness
in publishing this thesis as one of the Verhandelingen of the Instituut.
   My thanks are due to Dr J. C. Anceaux and Mr B. J. Hoff for
their suggestions made during the preparation of the book, suggestions
upon which I place great value.
  The translator, Miss Jeune Scott-KenAall, has been painstaking in
the difficult task of translating this work and her critical observations
have frequently led to a clearer formulation of the facts. Her efforts
deserve great praise.
   I t is not possible to name every person who was so1 helpful to my
wife and me during our stay in New Guinea and who made our sojourn
one of great pleasure, but they are remembered with gratitude.
   I will, however, mention those who were directly concerned with
my work. Foremost among them were Dr A. A. Gerbrands and
Mr D. B. Eyde who were carrying out anthropological fieldwork in
the Asmat country. Their friendship and their continued interest was
a stimulus to my own work and their knowledge of Asmat culture
enabled me to catch a glimpse of the inner working of this remarkable
society. Here the name of Pater G. Zegwaard, M.S.C. at Merauke
must not pass without comment. By placing his own field notes at the
disposal of the fieldworkers in the Asrnat country, he made accessible

7. The quotation marker in/un/n
258
in/un/n occurs in sentences containing a quotation in direct or in
indirect speech, or containing a statement made from hearsay.
It's noteworthy that the rule of distribution obtaining for in/un is
parallel to that which applies to the verbal forrnatives i t w n / u t h , it/ut
and to a number of verbal suffixes (see $ 91): un occurs after word-
final m (except after em, to stand), and after word-final p, w or f
preceded by a, o or 26, except after ap to sit. in occurs in the other cases.
n 46 was found only in two texts, narrated by a boy from Jepbni.
(Text VII and IX, 5s 303-306; 316-320). In these texts it occurs
after form 6 of category 19:
      Sajan at&tow@mare'n           first she dropped Safan upstream (5 303).in/un/n always occurs at the absolute end of a word-group.4746 With exception of a few interjections, and n2 ($ 2.59). n is distinguished from
   all other words by the absence of vowels. In order to indicate that in n a vowel
   has been dropped, I shall write 'a. The same applies to n1.",[188]
"151
E. Forms with the prefix tep-ftepa-: these are distinguished from
the forms with up-fops- by a semantic element of negation :
      e   h tep-dmph-mh why won't you also go fishing?
      fish /why won't you also go fishing/Instead of en& tepampia-mh, one can also say: 20
      endm m-ampi pdk o p d - e m a - m h .
      fish /also to fish/ not /why don't you/
15 The progressive forms of the mediate past152
A division into non-mood and mood forms does not occur here.
The durative formative here occurs in the allomorph a.
(Paradigms:     see p. 105)Formal characteristics
158
Aspect suffix : -4-am/zero.
-m occurs after core-final V, and after core-final C + m when a vowel
follows the aspect suffix (forms 1. and 2.).",[116]
"202
Pacdk bad, unfit, has irregular derivatives: the suffix -up and -as
are added to pacdk instead of -nakdp and -nakds:
These derivatives express intensity of feeling. Phcakdp is used to
express compassion, for example :
      n d t pacakdp!     my poor man! (said by a wife about a deformed
      husband).",[151]
"
31  B y the syntactical valence of a word is meant: the possibility of the word
    forming word-groups with other words.
31a The meanings of ji and e / j overlap each other: both can mean to do, to say.
    e / j in addition can mean: to become, to make.

"7 The -6jpurUw category114
The following forms were noted :
Like the forms of the -6jmos category, I could not find any difference
in meaning between forms with and without a prefix. -djipurUw occurs
only with cores ending in the durative formative, which here, also,
occurs in the allomorph ewer. With regard to -purUw, there is some
doubt whether we are here dealing with a suffix : the structure CVCVC
was not found in any other suffix. Since, however, -fu&        was only
found in combination with verbal forms, in a position parallel to that
of the suffix -mas, 1 shall regard it as a suffix.
The -hjpurUzu forms differ semantically from the -djmos forms in that
they do not express an exhortation, but a disapprobation:lo'For the   final o in akdjmosb, see 5 33.

"8 Research in Ag-ats and Jepem  I began the investigation at Agats, but since Agats was completely
outside the sphere of Asmat society - it was a 15-minute walk from
Surh - I decided, once I had surmounted the first difficulties of the
language, to continue it in one of the Asmat villages in the vicinity
of Agate. By living amidst the Asmat people I would be able quietly
to observe the way in which Asmat society functioned and would
become acquainted with the people and their language. Surfi was less
suitable as a place in which to stay because the presence of the Govern-
ment and the Missions had to a certain extent already influenced the
way of life there. The village of Jepkm, where both my informants
had relatives, appeared to be the most suitable, and from May, 1961,
the investigation was carried on from there, interrupted from time
to time by a short sojourn in Agats.
   During the period of my stay in the Asmat region, the Dutch scholar,
Dr. A. A. Gerbrands, and the American student D. B. Eyde, were
also there: the former doing research into Asrnat art, similarly under
the auspices of W.O.N.G., and the latter doing ethnological field work.
Their presence was of great value in acquiring as good an insight as
                             INTRODUCTION                             9possible into Asmat culture. Many were the pleasurable and stimulating
discussions we had when we were together, either in the house of
the W.O.N.G. in Agats or at the 'Wong Club', as Dr. Gerbrands'
house in the village of Amhamkaj was called. During the last year,
a lively correspondence on mythological and linguistic subjects was
kept up with Eyde. A knowledge of mythology seemed to be of the
greatest importance for acquiring an insight into Asmat culture, and
it was for this reason that I put as many tales as possible on the tape.
I collected approximately 80 texts, but these represent only a fraction
of the wealth of stories the Asmat people know.

                             PHONOLOGY
I THE PHONOLOGICAL SYSTEMIntroduction
   The phonological description is based on the speech of the two
principal informants. In the cases where their speech deviates from
that of other people speaking the same dialect, the difference will be
mentioned.
   The system used for the phonetic spelling is that followed by the
American linguist, K, L. Pike, in his work ""Phonemics"".~ The
phonetic transcription, in accordance with usual practice, is put between
square brackets; the phonematic transcription between solidi. In the
phonetic spelling, the accent is indicated by a sign placed before
the accented vowel Fa] : in the phonematic spelling, by a sign above
the accented vowel /a/, The following signs are also used : # = other
than; Q = alternating with; C = consonant; V = vowel.
  The term duster means a biarticulate, non-geminate intervocalic
consonant cluster. The terms initial, media! and final indicate positions
in the word.","[20, 21, 22]"
"117
Modal suffix : -c.
-c occurs after the suffix of object category I, and alternates freely
with zero;
-c occurs before the suffix of object categories I1 and 111.
In. these cases, -c alternates freely with zero, when the core ends in r.
Object suffixes:
I. a. -i/-u  ; -i and -u are conditioned allornorphs.
    According to the rule formulated in 3 91 (//itum/utum) they are
    mutually exclusive.
    b. -ej.
11. -en alternates freely with -in.
111. - a w ~ j .
Prefixes :
A. a-/aj-/an- ; m-/mV- ; p-/pV-.
a- is only found before a core-initial consonant, or. a. aj- or an- also
occur before a instead of a-.
m- and p- occur before vowels,
mV- and pV- occur before consonants. As a rule, the vowel is identical
to the first vowel of the core, but it can also be a, irrespective of the
vowel following. No definite regularity could be discerned here.
These prefixes can also be absent: when, however, the core consists
of one vowel, there is always a prefix. In the cases noted this prefix
was mostly a-.
B. mom-/porn- appear to alternate freely.

1. The imperative forms with prefixes of series A, oir without a prefix.
No difference in meaning could be found between the forms with and
without a prefix or between the forms which each have a prefix.
The form with 0- and with m-/mV- are interchangeable ; the forms
with p-/pV- are perhaps rather more emphatic than the others,
All these forms, with the exception of those with -cej, express a
command that must be obeyed immediately:

48                             THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
     The difference in meaning between roots with and without this
     formative seems to be that the roots without em/om- mean: 'to be'
     or 'to move5, of a subject which belongs to the 'lying', 'standing',
     'flying' or 'swimming' class of things,l whereas the roots with
     em/um- denote the actual action of lying, sitting, etc.
     The roots with em/om- have, moreover, an inchoative element of
     meaning : they can mean : to lie down, to sit down, etc.
     up 'to be, to move', of a 'sitting' subject.

"     In using the term meaning exclusively for the semantic aspect of words, and
     the term value for the semantic aspect of parts of words, or morphemes,
     I follow E. M, Uhlenbeck and A. Reichling. See: E. M. Uhlenbeck, De

In addition, there are a number of cases in which the value of this
formative is not clear to me; such as in:
   &.ta.m, having apparently the same meaning as the underlying
   form ni.taj 'to return and reach', in:
   tdmnakap ni.ta.m-or
   ""morning-a-bit / she arrived/
   she arrived (home) towards the end of the morning,
when compared with :

"The verbal core can be monomorphematic or polymqhematic. The
peripheral part consists of prefixes and/or suffixes added to the core.
   The mutual independence of the core and the peripheral part shows
itself in a difference in internal organization which makes a separate
description of the two parts necessary.
   Their mutual dependence shows itself in the fact that: a. a verb
consists either of a core, or of a core +   peripheral part, but never of
a peripheral part alone; and b. there are a number of verbal categories
that do not occur with cores ending with the morphemes iturn, es, it
or u w e ~(see 5s 91-94).

The morphological structure of the core
     Only provisional observations can be made here about the structure
of the core. The reason for this is that the main point of research, as
regards the verb, was an investigation into the verbal categories. An
insight into the structure of the verbal system proved to' be a pre-
requisite if I were to understand and to speak the Asmat language.
The relative independence of the core made it possible, temporarily
to leave its structure outside consideration. Since, however, research
into the verbal categories took most of the available time, there was
none left for a systematic examination of the cores. This remains one
of the most important tasks for future research.
  Consequently, the paragraphs on co-re-structure, as well as the para-
graphs on core-morphology, represent only a preliminary reconnaissance
in the field. The picture of the core-structure given here is for the
main part based on indirect information, i.e. information obtained from
an analysis of a specific corpus of verbal cores of which only a small
part was elicited from the informants with this analysis in view. This
corpus of verbal cores consists of 2 3,000 cores, of which Â±1.200
occur in the texts to be appended to this grammatical description.","[54, 55]"
"4 Present research, choice of dialect   The following description of the language is the result of an inves-
tigation into the coastal dialect around Flamingo Bay which was
carried out from November, 1960, to September, 1962, under the
auspices of the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Nieuw-Guinea
(W.O.N.G.).s
   The aim of this research was the collecting of material for a descrip-
tion of one of the Asmat dialects. Outside Mission circles in New
Guinea, almost nothing was known about Asmat. Drabbe's grammar
of the Ajkm dialect had been published, though this fact was not
known to me until I arrived in the area, and found that the Mission
disposed over a few copies of it. The only thing on Asmat I had had
at my disposal was a short vocabulary at the end of Drabbe's KAmoro
grammar. Thus a preliminary orientation into the language was not
possible. The investigation had to be started from scratch,
   For some time the Roman Catholic Mission had been opening
schools in the Asmat region, the language taught in them being Malay,  Primitive Society, thesis, Van Gorcum & Co., Assen, 1964. This thesis also
  contains a complete bibliography of works containing information on Asmat,
  up to 31th December, 1962.

the thing to do in this situation was to use Malay as the contact
language and to make use of bilingual informants - Asrnat Papuans
who had acquired a reasonable knowledge of Malay in school.
   On arrival in the area, it became clear that the number of Asrnat
Papuans with such a knowledge of Malay was meagre. These potential
informants belonged almost entirely to the younger generation -
children who had attended the three-year lower school of the Mission
at the Government Station at Agats, or who had left it. Only a few
of the ollder men knew some Malay. The children who went to school
in Agats came from the neighbouring village of Sur~?,and from Ajkrn.
The language of the village of Ajirn, already examined by Drabbe,
belonged to a dialect different from that of the coastal villages, one
of which was Surh, in the environs of Agats, and I therefore decided
to make the dialect spoken at Surh the object of the investigation.","[16, 17]"

1 The Asmat language: area, adjacent languages, dialects   The language of the Asmat Papuans, Asmat,l is one of a number
of related Papuan languages which are spoken over an extensive area
of the coastal plain of South-West New Guinea (Irian Barat). These
languages extend along the coast from the River Opa in the nolrth-west
to the mouth of the River Digul in the south-east.2
   The Asmat region is generally considered to be the coastal strip
and the adjacent hinterland between the Rivers Momkc (Le Cocq
d'Armandville) and Ewtii. In addition to his region, however, Asmat
is also spoken in a small area to the east of the confluence of the Rivers
Sirkc (Eilanden) and Wildeman; on the coastal strip between the
Ewtk and Cook Bay (the Casuarinen Coast) ; and in a few villages
on the coast between Cook Bay and the mouth of the River Digul.
   I t is still not known with certainty how far inland the Asmat
language-area extends. I t was only recently that this coastal area was
brought under Government control and that part of the low-lying
plain abutting onto the mountainous country in the centre is still
practically terra incognita. Up to now, Asmat villages have been
encountered inland to a distance of more than 70 miles.
   To the north-west of the Asmat language-area, two languages relatedIntroductory note

                           THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
to Asmat, KAn~oroand Skmpan, are spoken. These two languages
cover the whole coastal area between the Rivers Opa and Otakwa.
Between the Otakwa and the MomAc, where the Asmat language-area
begins, there are no villages. Nothing is known about the languages
to the north and the north-east of the Asmat language-area : in the east
and the south-east, Asmat meets up with the Awju and Jakaj languages,
which are probably not related to Asmat.3
   Asmat has various dialects, but a systematic investigation into them
has not yet been made, so that little is known about the nature and
extent of the dialectical variations. Broadly, Asmat dialects can be
divided into a central group of little differing dialects with, around it,
on the periphery of the Asmat language-area, a number of dialects
differing sharply from it: those spoken upstream of the Rivers Pomiic
(Noordwest), Unir (Lorentz) and Sirkc, and the dialect of the
Casuarinen Coast.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"3. The directional class

This class consists of only two members : the directional pronoun a*,
and the neutral pronoun a/ar :

3. the breaking of the rules of phoneme distribution;
4. the breaking of the rules of accentuation.","[170, 171, 172, 173]"

In this category there is a division into three object categories, a
division that also occurs in categories 10 to 24, inclusive. These object
categories are :I.    a. the verb has no object ;
      b. the object or, where the verb admits of two' objects, the indirect
      object, is neither the speaker, nor a group to which the speaker
      belongs, nor the person(s) spoken to :
          him, her, if; them.11, the object or the indirect object, is the speaker or the person(s)
    spoken to :
          me, you.111. the object, or the indirect object, is a group of people to which
     the speaker considers himself to belong at the time of speaking:

      look over there !)

      perhaps it was fish we always ate formerly! (8 302).
