4.6.1 Negative declarativeThe negation of declarative clauses involves a denial of intransitive,
transitive and ditransitive clauses or predications. All of these declarative
types are negated by two negative particles in the clause: the negativeparticle 'kV-', which is procliticised to a verb; it occurs in slot 1 in Table4.1, and the negative particle '-Vŋ' which is encliticised to a verb or verbphrase; it occurs in slot 12 in Table 4.1 in case of intransitive verbs, and
the final position of a clause in case of transitive clauses. Therefore, the
former is considered as a particle which negates the whole clause. Theproclitic negative marker 'kV-' always fuses with the pronominal markersin slot 3 in Table 4.1. The following examples illustrate negation with a
negative verb contrasting positive verb forms with negative ones.",[276]
"
Negation in Tima is expressed by using different strategies; see section2.4.1.3. On the one hand, it uses two negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in asingle clause, especially in negating the declarative and imperative
clauses. It is the most common strategy of negation marking in Tima. On
the     other   hand,    Tima       uses   an    inherently   negative   quantifier'amaŋaŋ'/'amaŋ', 'nothing/lack/not-exist' to indicate that the event orsituation described by the verb does not occur or exist.",[275]
"4.6.2 Negative imperative, subjunctive and veridical moodIn most cases, the imperative, subjunctive and veridical clauses in Tima
are negated in the same way as the negation of declarative clauses, i.e. bythe particle 'kV' and 'Vŋ'. The examples in 178 and 179 show how the                                      257
imperative negation is being applied to the 2sg, 2pl and the subjunctive
weak form in the case of 1pl inclusive. The negative particles areunderlined in the examples below. Concerning the negative particle 'kV',here they are variable with regard to the person and number and they are
changed according to the vowel harmony of the verb root (Bashir
forthcoming).","[278, 279]"

2.4.1.3 Negation
Sometimes, negation is considered as a mood type in contrast with
imperative and interrogative sentence type. But here the negation is taken
as a verbal inflection which modifies the verb and the verb phrase. This
leads us to distinguish between two types and strategies of sentence
negation as found in African languages. The first type is an internal
negation of the verb word which is common in African languages. This
usually involves affixes either before or after the verb word. An example
of this strategy is found in Aghem, a Benue-Congo (Niger-Congo)
language (Anderson, 1979), and in Labala, a Bantu (Niger-Congo)
language (David Morgan, p.c.). The second type is an external negation
of the verb word. That is, negative particles occur in clause-final position
and it negates the whole clause or sentence. In the case of transitive
verbs, the negative particle occurs after the object. This type is found in
Chadic languages in Nigeria and Cameroon (Creissels, 2008).","[60, 61]"
"
Tima has two obligatory negative particles that appear in a negative
sentence: The negative proclitic marker 'kV-' and the negative enclitic
marker '-Vŋ'. In this respect, Tima resembles Hausa, a Chadic language
(Kraft and Kraft, 1973) and Gur (Niger- Congo) languages (Watters,
2000) in using double negative particles which are external to the verb
word. Consequently, Tima in most cases displays the following negative
pattern: (S) NEG-SM-V root-(O)-NEG (see 4.6).",[61]
"
The chapter concluded by presenting the two different strategies of verbalnegation: (i) with the negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic'Vŋ'and (ii) with the negative expression 'amaŋ'. It is found that Tima has a
                                    314
common strategy of negating declarative sentences, which is the first one
mentioned above. Moreover, the form of negated sentences depends on
the aspect distinction, e.g. whether it is perfective or imperfective. In thelatter, the negation-marking expression 'amaŋ' is used.","[335, 336]"
"                                           254
In Section 4.6.1 the negative constructions of declarative sentence type
will be presented. The negative construction of the imperative,
subjunctive and veridical mood will be shown in 4.6.2. The negation of
perfective and imperfective verb forms will be described and discussed in
Section 4.6.3.","[275, 276]"
"
4.6 Verbal negation
Tima has different types of negation marking. That is, the negative
strategy in Tima involves negation of the whole clause, in which case it is
described as clausal negation. Or, alternatively, it negates some of the
clause constituents, such as nouns, adverbs, adjectives and quantifiers.
This type is described as constituent negation (Alamin forthcoming).",[275]
"
All tenses (future vs. non-future) of verbs are negated simply by addingthe two negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ'. See the examples above.",[278]

follows:
NEG + IMP/SUBJ (O) + NEG
With regard to the negation of veridical clauses, it has been mentioned inSection (4.4.3.4) that the verdical marker in Tima is 'kV-', thereforehaplology (see section 2.2.1.3) as a phonological process takes placewhen negating these clauses. That is, the proclitic negative marker 'kV-' isdropped because of its similarity with the veridical marker 'kV-', whilethe enclitic negative marker '-Vŋ' occurs. The examples are in (180)below.

                                            259
4.6.3 Perfective and imperfective negation
Tima uses the two negative strategies mentioned above. In the case ofperfective situation the common negative strategy ('kV-' and '-Vŋ'particles) is used as in (180). Alternatively, in the case of imperfectivesituations the quantifier 'amaŋ' is used as in (181). This form consists ofthe stative marker 'a-' plus 'maŋ' which means 'it is nothing'. But actuallythe form 'maŋ' has no meaning by itself; see the examples below.","[279, 280, 281]"
"
In Tima, the positive imperative mood is unmarked for person in the case
of 2nd person singular; i.e. it does not take any personal prefix as the
subjunctive mood type does. In the case of 2nd person plural it is markedby the prefix 'na-' which is very productive in the language. It is foundthat in the case of the negative imperative mood for the 2nd personsingular that the form is marked by the prefix 'a-' which occurs after thenegative proclitic 'kV-'. In this case the imperative form is classified as ahortative form/mood (weak imperative/command, see 4.6 on verbal
negation).",[227]

     'he did not drink milk'
On the other hand, the examples of negative imperfective in (182) below
indicate that the situation or action which is negated has not finished yet.",[281]

        'Hamid does not teach me Tima'
The formula of negated intransitive and transitive clauses is as follows:
NEG + VP (includes V + NP (O)) + NEG
It is noticed that the negative particles usually harmonize with the verb
root. In example (174, 175 and 176) above the proclitic negative marker'kV-' harmonizes with the verb root with regard to the feature of ± ATRand to the other qualities of the vowel (in terms of frontness, height, or
backness), (Bashir forthcoming).","[277, 278]"
"
                                                  19
Therefore, languages usually use such types of morphological processes
in order to express different morphological functions, such as number,
case, polarity, etc. For instance, Asheron (a Niger-Kordofanian language)
uses the prefixes for number marking on nouns, in addition to other
prefixes which are attached to the adjectives in order to show agreement
between the noun and the adjective in a noun phrase (Alamin, 2003).","[40, 41]"
"
If the imperative verb stem takes a direct object (i.e. if it is a transitive
verb), the second enclitic negative marker is encliticized to the end of the
clause. That is, it negates the whole clause as in (179).",[279]
"
2.4.1 Verb structure
Usually, the verb consists of a number of morphemes which express
different grammatical categories plus the verb root. The output verb form
is referred to as a verb stem. For instance, the English verb 'look' is
considered as a verb root where the verb 'look' plus the '-ed' past marker
form the verb stem 'looked'. The order of morphemes in the verb differs
from one language to another. Some of them appear either as prefixes/
suffixes or as infixes. If one looks at Swahili verb structure (an SVO
language), different slots are occupied by different morphological
categories,   for   example,    subject   agreement-Tense/Aspect-(object
agreement)-verb root-(derivational suffixes)-mood vowel. Tima verb
structure is much more complicated than the Swahili verb structure. The
Tima verb, in its most complex form, contains more than ten slots
expressing different grammatical categories, such as the following:
(negative marker) - aspect marker - proclitic subject marker – tense - verb
root - (derivational suffixes) - (object marker) - enclitic subject marker -
(negative marker) (see 4.2 on the verb as a word structure). These various
slots on the verb express different types of inherent grammatical
categories associated with the verb such as subject/object marker (i.e.
person markers), TAM, derivational affixes. These grammatical                                    35
categories of the verb will be discussed below with reference to their
occurrence mainly in African languages.","[56, 57]"
"
The examples of negative perfective aspect in (181) below indicate that
the situation or the event which is negated is finished completely.",[281]
"
The subjunctive form in Tima is formed by the prefix 'i-' for the 1st personplural inclusive on the verb. This subjunctive mood in Tima is also clear
in the negative subjunctive mood (see also 4.6). They express weak
obligations. It is highly productive and systematic. The examples are:
(118)
1st Pl incl                               gloss
a) ɪ-dɨŋʌʌŋ                               'let's bring s.th'b) ɪ-daa                                  'let's run'c) ɪ-hʊdɔnɔ                               'let's sit down'd) ɪ-hɘlak                                'let's remain seated'
The structure of the subjunctive forms can be represented by the
following formula.
a) 1st pl incl:   ɪ-stem
                                        208
4.4.3.3 Indicative mood
Indicative mood is used to assert a proposition as a fact. It is also referred
to as declarative mood (Whaley, 1997). The indicative mood in Tima is
morphologically unmarked. It constitutes the most basic sentence type.
Therefore, it is not marked for modality.","[229, 230]"

In the above examples, it is not possible to omit one of the two negative
particles in a clause, otherwise the resultant clause will be ungrammatical.

        'he has not finished drinking milk yet'
Moreover, it is found that with certain verbs (both telic and atelic verbs)
the negation of perfective and imperfective differs with regard to the verb
forms. Both perfective and imperfective aspects are negated by thenegative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic '-Vŋ'. Therefore, in thecase of perfective aspect the negated verb takes the form of telic verbs as
in (183a) below, while in the case of imperfective aspect the negated
form takes the form of atelic verb as in (183b) (see 4.4.2.4).

Having finished discussing the Tima verb morphology, the following
chapter will focus on the the processes of nominalizing the nouns and the
major categories from which they are derived from. In addition, the
compound nouns will be described in detail.","[281, 282, 283]"
"
Type 1: Compounds with 'arɔŋ'Compounds can also be formed by a bound word 'arɔŋ', which means'one who likes'. The word 'arɔŋ' must attach to a noun in order to give afull meaning. Thus, the result is agentive noun, as can be seen in (65) (see
5.1.2). It always carries a negative connotation.",[328]
"This name is used by other inhabitants of the Nuba Mountains including
Arabic communities without carrying any negative connotation to its
native speakers and it is widely used in the literature, i.e. this language
name is well known to the outsiders and linguists. Tima people refer to
                                     3
their language as 'du-murik'. It also has several alternative names used by
others neighboring groups when referring to Tima speakers, such as:
Lomoriki, Tamanik, and Yibwa (Grimes, 1984).","[24, 25]"
"
2.4 The verb
This section presents and discusses the structure of the verb with regard
to the most common inherent grammatical/morphological categories
which are associated with it. In most languages, especially African
languages, the most complicated word structure is found with regard to                                      34
the verb. All the information about arguments indexation (pronominal
markers), TAM distinctions, negation and verb extensions are encoded on
the verb by means of affixes or by other word formation processes (see
2.2.1). This complexity is found in languages which have a very rich
inflection system, such as found in the Niger-Congo languages (e.g.
Swahili).","[55, 56]"

It is noticed that there is vowel length with regard to the negative formThe vowel of the negative proclitic 'kV(V)-' is lengthened. It is a result ofthe combination of the proclitic vowel and the person marker in the caseof 2nd sg and 1pl incl, which is usually represented by the vowel 'a-' and'i-', respectively (see 4.4.3.1).",[279]
"
Slot 1 and 12 are occupied by negative markers. The negative marker inslot 1 'kV' is considered as a proclitic which is usually fused with thepronominal marker 'PM' (when there is no aspect marker), whereas thenegative marker in slot 12 '-Vŋ' is considered as an enclitic. Theiroccurrence is obligatory when they negate a verb phrase/clause (see
Section 4.6). For example:
(4)

'do not drink'
Slot 2 contains aspect and mood markers. This slot is filled by different
markers according to aspect and mood (for mood markers see Section
4.4.3.4). In the case of aspect, it is either filled by the progressive marker'cʌ' or the stative aspect marker 'a' (Section 4.4). The aspect markersalways fuse with the person marker e.g. 'N' in slot 3 (4.3.2.1); they form a
                                      144
portmanteau morpheme as in (5). The person marker appears in the case
of the 1st person singular, 3rd person singular/plural (the person marker 'N'harmonizes with the following consonant) and the morpheme 'na-' in thecase of 2nd person plural, see example (6).

3.2.4 Demonstratives
The basic function of demonstratives is to point out the spatial position of
some entity with regard to the speaker and the hearer. A language usually
displays a two/three-way distinction among demonstrative modifiers:
near the speaker, near the hearer and/or far from both speaker and hearer
(Croft, 1990). Demonstratives in Tima form a closed class 8. As
demonstratives always express distance, Tima has three degrees of
distance. The demonstratives have the following forms:
-nʌ                   'this/these; near the speaker and hearer'-ya                   'that/those; far from the speaker and hearer or near the hearer'-ya luy               'that/those far away from both the speaker and hearer but it is still
                      visible'
Unlike many class languages (e.g. Swahili and Fulfulde), Tima, has no
number agreement between nouns and the demonstrative modifiers in a
noun phrase, except when they are used elliptically, as will be seen in
8
    There are no 'articles' in Tima.",[144]

2.4.2 Head-marking language
Having completed discussing the most important inflectional categories
(pronominal markers, TAM, negation) and derivational categories on
verbs (DAs and pluractional), we are now in a position to classify a
                                      43
language like Tima on the base of this information. A language which has
such a rich inflection and derivation system is classified as a head-
marking language versus a dependent-marking language like Ghulfan, a
Nubian language spoken north of Tima. In a head-marking language the
verb as the head of the clause/sentence carries all the information with
regard to person markers, TAM, and derivational operations expressing
the different semantic roles involved in the structure of the verb. On the
other hand, dependent-marking languages usually makes distinction
between subject and object (i.e. the syntactic function of a noun) by way
of morphological case markers on nouns (e.g. nominative-accusative
case, as in Latin (Corbett, 1998) or the Nubian language Ghulfan for that
matter.","[64, 65]"
"
Chapter two has covered all the necessary information that is required in
discussing the word structure of a language like Tima. It described first
how the word is defined from a linguistic point of view (2.1.1); in
addition, the most important operations (2.2.1) that build up the words in
languages have been discussed with examples from other languages and
with reference to the Tima language as well. Sections (2.3) and (2.4)
handled the two major categories found in this language: the noun and the
verb. The major inherent grammatical categories associated with each
class have been described and discussed elaborately. The final output of
the verbal categories reveals that one can classify the language according
to the way syntactic and semantic relations are expressed; this
information may be expressed mainly on the verb, in which we are
dealing with a head-marking language at the clausal level, or,
alternatively, on noun phrases expressing different semantic roles, in
which we are dealing with a dependent-marking language (2.4.2).",[333]

2.1.2 Clitics
Halpern (1998) stated that the distinction between independent
words/phrases and affixes is clear. But there are various formatives in
many languages that are hardly classified as full words or affixes. These
formatives are often called 'clitics'. Moreover, Bubenik (1999: 23)
pointed out that ""clitics are viewed as falling between full-fledged words
and grammatical affixes. Full-fledged words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs) carry lexical accent and their lexical meaning is of symbolic
nature; on the other hand, adpositions, articles, particles and pronouns do
not carry accent and their lexical meaning is of indexical nature"".
Obviously, the phonological criterion only plays a role in languages using
stress. The clitics are of two types: proclitic, which precedes the host, and
enclitic, which follows the host. For instance, the definite article in
English is a proclitic 'the=man' while its counterpart in Romanian is an
enclitic 'om=ul' 3 .","[37, 38]"
"
Mood ('modality', or 'mode') is another important category of a verb. It is
defined by Crystal (1991: 223) as ""a grammatical category through which
the speakers of a language can indicate whether they believe that an event
or state actually occurs, does not occur, or has the potential to occur"".
Traditionally, grammarians and linguists categorize a sentence into major
types based on mood. These types are: indicative, imperative,
subjunctive, and interrogative mood. These categories may be signaled by
alternative inflectional forms of the verb. For example, in Alaaba (a
Cushitic language spoken in Ethiopia) mood is marked morphologically
on verbs especially in the case of directive and optative, while the
indicative mood is unmarked (Schneider-Blum, 2007).          On the other
hand, mood may be marked by using auxiliaries as the case in English.",[59]

  c-ɪt̪ɪ               a-rdi  NC.sg-cloth          STAT.sg-red
  'the cloth is red'
On the other hand, the verbs in Tima usually marked by the stative aspectmarker 'a-/ɪ-' express the perfectivity of an action/event. In this case, thestative marker precedes the verb root plus the pronominal marker
(subject). An example is:
(114)
an-diy-ʌŋASP(stative).3sg-come-Ven
'he/they came'
4.4.3 Mood
This section will shed light on the different types of moods (see 2.4.1.2
on mood types) found in Tima. The imperative form will be described in
4.4.3.1. The subjunctive form will be shown in 4.4.3.2. The indicative
will be presented in 4.4.3.3 with regard to the word order in Tima
sentences. Section 4.4.3.4 will briefly show how the interrogative is
formed in Tima. Negation will be discussed separately in section (4.6).","[225, 226]"
"
The situation in Tima is similar to the former type, where the Tima
imperative and the indicative are morphologically unmarked (i.e. carry a
zero morpheme), the subjunctive mood is morphologically marked on
                                    38
verb by a prefix (i-). Certainty is marked by a proclitic on verbs (kV-)
(see 4.4.3). In addition, the interrogative mood is also marked by a
particle on the verb or in the final position of a clause; it is mainly a
vowel.","[59, 60]"
"
Pluractional marking usually involves the multiplicity of subjects, objects
or the repetitition of an action itself (Williamson and Blench 2000). For
                                    42
this aspect of plurality marking on verbs the term “pluractional” is coined
by Newman (1990) in his study of Chadic verbs (e.g. Kanakuru
language). Such phenomena are also widespread in Niger-Congo
languages. Aaron (1994) has studied verbal number in Obolo (Benue-
Congo language). He states that languages in general follow different
processes for expressing pluractionals on verbs. Examples of these
processes are: by way of affixes that are attached to the verb root, full or
partial reduplication of the verb root/stem, internal change of the verb
stem, or by using supletive verb forms to indicate plurality. The last
process, i.e. suppletive form is described by Bybee (1985) in her survey
of some languages of the world. She found that in Kung, a language of
southern Africa, there are two forms of verbs. One form is used when the
subject/object is singular and the other form is used when the
subject/object of a sentence is plural.","[63, 64]"

1.7 Presentation of language data
The Tima language data are presented, for those who want to study/ learn
it, in the following way. In each example, there are three lines: the first
line gives the data in the Tima language. The second line is a word-for-
word translation into English. It includes a number of abbreviations that
are listed in the list of abbreviation (pp xii). The third line gives a free
translation of phrases and clauses in English so that those who do not
understand Tima can understand the meaning.",[32]

5.1.2 Agentive nouns
The agentive nouns in Tima can be classified into three types according
to their semantic structure: (i) agentive nouns that describe a person who
does the action intentionally, (ii) agentive nouns that describe one who
does an action unintentionally and (iii) the one who does an action as a
profession. Each type has its own way of forming the agentive nouns. In
most cases, agentive nouns are derived from verbs. In other cases, theyare formed by adding a bound morpheme (e.g. arɔŋ, 'like') whichsometimes carry a negative connotation. A few Tima agentive nouns do
not seem to be derived from any other word classes; i.e. they are nouns by
themselves that express an occupation or profession.","[301, 302]"

                                 Abstract
This study tries to describe and analyze the structure of the word in Tima
(a Kordofanian language), mainly the structure of the noun and the verb.
Its aim is to fulfill the following two objectives: first, to provide a
comprehensive description of unwritten language. Secondly, to document
Tima as one of the endangered languages in Sudan.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"
The status of clitics as occupying an intermediate position between full
words and affixes is also reflected in varying spelling conventions of
various languages. For example, in French the pronominal clitics are
hyphenated in the imperative. Anther way of writing clitics is found in
Spanish where the pronominal clitics are written together with their verb,
i.e. they are written as one word. The same is true for Arabic where the
conjuction 'and' and other prepositions are spelled as proclitics.",[38]
"
Another way of defining wordhood, also based on a phonological
criterion, involves identifying the potentiality of pausing between words
in a sentence (to help the analyst or the learner). This criterion helps in
dividing the sentence into several words (Matthews, 1991). All the above2
 This phonological criterion is encountered with a problem. That is, the accent in French sometimes
marks the whole phrase instead of a single word (for more explanation, see Anderson 1985a).",[36]
"
2.4.1.1 Pronominal markers
In African languages, the subject and object are normally expressed on
the verb by bound morphemes. The term 'pronominal markers' is used to
refer to subject/object distinctions. They are considered as an inherent
inflectional category of verb. By definition, the pronominal markers refer
to an entity of a noun phrase which is found elsewhere in the sentence
and they usually distinguish between subject/object from a syntactic point
of view.",[57]
"
The study uses different techniques in collecting primary data: firstly, a
collection of word-lists. This word-list is recorded and transferred into
Audiofiles 3 . This helps considerable when trying to listen to the proper
pronunciation of words and sorting out the different noun-class prefixes
found in Tima. The second technique for collecting the data is elicitation.
It mainly helps in describing the various morphological features and the
grammar of a language. The elicitation is done with native speakers by
using both English and Arabic in order to avoid misunderstanding of
sentences. Thirdly, a number of texts were collected and subsequently
written by using the Transcriber program. The stories include stories,
songs and procedural texts. These texts help a lot in identifying the
different types of word classes and sentence structure. In addition, they
support the description and analysis of the most problematic phenomena
found in Tima, such as tense and aspect.",[31]

Another prominent feature which is associated with aspectual
grammatical categories is 'aktionsart'; in other contexts this inflectional
category is referred to as lexical aspect (Comrie, 1981). Whaley (1997:
214) mentions that ""aktionsart plays an important role in determining
how time reference in a sentence is understood"". Thus, a verb conveys an
inherent aspectual meaning of being extended or not extended in time.
The English verb 'read' as an example is durative and this means that the
action described by the verb lasts for a certain period of time, whereas the
verb 'sneeze' is punctual, because the event happens instantaneously.
Accordingly, Bybee (1985) states that languages appear to have different
aktionsart classes, for example: punctual, iterative, durative, stative,
achievement and accomplishment.","[58, 59]"
"
Accordingly, Tima is considered as a head-marking language. The
complex form of the verb with its various slots carries all the information
required with regard to the number of arguments in a sentence and other
valency operations mentioned above. Therefore, the Tima verb can be
treated as forming a complete clause/sentence without any need for other
sentence's constituents to be mentioned (see 4.2).",[65]
"This classification has been revised by Schadeberg (1981a). He has
classified the Kordofanian languages into four groups with new names.
These names are referred to by way of the names of towns where these
languages are located. The four groups are:
(1) Heiban group. It consists of Koalib, Heiban, Laro, Otoro, Tira,
Kanderma, etc.",[23]

which is a widespread phenomenon among languages, for example
English. In a case like this, the future-like interpretation depends on the
nature of the described situation and it is also understood from the
context. Therefore, the future marker 'dV-' in this case disappears from
the verb form (see the present tense in section 4.4.1.2.2). The examples in
(33) express that the speaker is departing, or about to leave. In addition,
the examples in (33) have another interpretation, that is the sentence
indicates the present tense; it can also indicate the habitual aspect byadding the adverb 'ʈɔʈɔk'.","[183, 184]"
"It is also found that the locative particle 'lV-' is used with the personal
names that start with vowels. See the example below.",[154]

d) yay t̪ɔndɔ              kay t̪ɔndɔ                'messenger/s'
It is also found that the element 'kay' with its plural counterparts 'yay' isassociated with other verbal nouns in order to describe a person's quality.
Consider the following examples:
(30)AN.sg                      AN.Pl                      gloss
a) kay kuliil             yay kuliil                  'coward person/s'
b) kay muul                yay muul                   'brave person/s'

It is also found in the data that Tima uses a noun (as head) plus an
adjective in a predicate position in order to describe a person's quality.
The examples are:
(31) k-ah               a- dɪʔʔɪl    NC.sg-head         STAT-clean
    'cleaver person (lit. the head is clean)'Type 2: Agentive nouns with 'arɔŋ'
The agentive nouns found in this class are formed by the bound word'arɔŋ' which means 'like' plus the verbal nouns. This combination ofagentive nouns is formed by a kind of adjectival compound clause which
means 'who/which likes something (see 5.2 on compounding). The word'arɔŋ' is considered as a bound morpheme because it has no meaningwhen it occurs in isolation and it is not found in any other construction in
Tima. This means it is exclusively used with verbal nouns to derive
agentive nouns. Thus, the new compound nouns describe a person who
does an action unintentionally. This means that one can do/perform the
action as a habit. The others describe that person on that ground, but the
meaning usually conveys a negative connotation. The examples are:
                                           284

c) arɔŋ t̪amaa             'talkative'
d) arɔŋ kwɔɔ               'one who likes walking'Type 3: Agentive nouns that describe professions
The agentive nouns found in this class are formed by neither 'kay' nor'arɔŋ'. But some of them are nevertheless derived from verb roots. Theyactually resemble the verbal nouns in their forms. Agentive nouns in this
case are different. because of the changes that concern the tone levels
(Bashir forthcoming). The agentive nouns take a low tone levels
compared with the verbal nouns that take high tone. For example:
(33)AN                                         gloss
a) kʊhaal                                  'a field guard'
b) kʊdadɪɪ                                 'theif'

e) kɔdɔwa                                  'a lawyer'
On the other hand, a few examples of the agentive nouns do not seem to
be derived from any other word classes and they are purely nouns which
describe professions as in (34).","[304, 305, 306]"
"
Chapter four described, illustrated and analyzed all the morphological and
morphosyntactic features which are found in Tima so far. The chapter
starts by presenting the structure of Tima verbs. It was found that most of
the verbs are monosyllabic, in addition to a less numerous group of
disyllabic verb root. Trisyllabic verb roots are rare. In addition, the
structure of Tima verb stems has been presented, which contains, in
addition to the verbal root, other affixes or clitics. The presence of these
affixes or clitics on the verb forms the complex structure of the Tima
verbs. The stem/verb-word consisted of 12 slots, all together forming the
verb as a phonological and grammatical word. This complexity of verbs
has enabled us to classify the Tima as a typically head-marking language
at the clause level.",[334]
"
The same is true of Tima. The transitive verbs are morphologically
marked by suffixes. They are obligatory on the verbs and the verbal
meaning can not be expressed without them. The transitive suffixes differ
according to their frequency in the language and the degree of their
transitivity (either present as highly transitive markers or low transitive
markers).",[233]
"2.2.1.2 Stem modifications
A stem modification is another process which affects word structure; it
involves non-concatenation morphology 5 . Spencer (1991) stated that
stem modifications in many languages indicate grammatical categories by
a shift of vowel, consonant, stress and tone. English is an example where
the vowel alternation device marks tense in verbs such as 'drink/drank/
5
 The process of non-concatenative morphology indicates that the complex derived word form can not
be easily segmented into different morphemes; instead the morphological process can be described in
  process terms (Haspelmath, 2002).",[41]
