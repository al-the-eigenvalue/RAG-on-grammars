  8. Some speakers in some stylcs have one more phoneme not included in Table 3: a
very weak voiced velar fricative gh. It occurs in only four forms, three of which are very
common: -gh? 'locative', -gha 'negative', -gh6m+e 'past tense before reported speech'.
If these were the only cases, [y] could be set u p as the allophone of g or h that follows
hyphen juncture. But it also occurs in isaghik 'cottonwood', so that in intervocalic
position it contrasts with both g and h.
  I n most contexts gh is segmentally zero for most spealcers; those who use [y] at all
apparently do so only when it is emphasized. T h e fact that gh is written in the ortho-
graphy no doubt encourages the use of [y] in reading aloud. I n this study the speech of
those who do not use gh has been followed. T h e three common forms given above are
thus written -?, -a, -am&. Each is preceded by a new syllable onset, which is phono-
logically interpreted as a featurc of hyphen juncture preceding a vowel.
  9. w r y are treated as a set because they all become nasalized in the vicinity of a nasal
(1.3.').
   10. r is usually a single flap, but is apparently fricative for at least some speakers. I t
occurs initially only in the rare word riti* 'frame on which yams are tied for storage'
(probably a loanword), and in free variation with an initial vowel in riril or iriril 'feeling
of sorrow'. English loanwords normally acquire an initial vowel: or@]., 'rice', or6dA4
'Rhoda'.
   11. m n q have already been noted to nasalize vowels in their vicinity (I .3 .z).   12. q occurs initially in the unit only after hyphen juncture in the single form -9jmj or
-gj 'future tense'. Otherwise it occurs only as second consonant (i.e. when anothertion of the preceding and following vowels: bHq/

 4.3.7 There is another way of introducing a modifier from a constituent sentence
when the matrix contains a determiner. The modifier is not inserted between the deter-                  eri-ki, owei-bi-nl, b6 tub0 kiri fini-bo-bj
miner and the nominal of the matrix, but precedes both, followed by the locative -?.                    he em man T who came trade land open one T
One result of this is that determiners are not separated from their noun heads; the                     he is the one who came to open a trading post
ambiguity resulting from T.36 is thus avoided.                                                          omin/-nj, ami-? mb-yemi-otu-mo, ine ikia-6tu

                                                        My attempt to write a generative-transformational grammar stems from the interest
                                                     that I felt in the work of Noam Chomsky and others. I t seemed that certain features of
                                                     Ijg (such as the relation of the tone system to the syntax) might be interestingly described
                                                     by such methods. I have not, however, studied under transformationalists, and am well
                                                     aware that the grammar would be different if I had.

                                INTRODUCTION
   0.1 Jjy (1jaw)l is a language spoken over a wide area in southern Nigeria. T h e Ijy-
speaking peoples live mainly in Degema and Yenagoa Provinces in the Eastern Region
and in the Western Ijaw Division of Delta Province in the Midwest Region, with a few
outlying groups stretching as far west as Okitipupa Division in the Western Region. T h e
exact number of speakers is not known, but there are probably at lcast half a million.2
   T h e area inhabited by Ijy-speakers forms part of the Niger Delta. T h e land is inter-
sected by rivers and creeks; transport is often easier by water than by land. Conscquently
lines of communication tend to run u p and down stream, roughly from north to south,
rather than from east to west, except in the coastal creeks. T h e inland parts of the delta
are fertile, as the silt brought down by the Niger in the flood season (roughly, July to
 Octoher) is deposited on the farmland; but the parts nearer the ocean and towards the
east are tidal, and little vegetation except mangroves flourishes in the salt water.
   T h e economy of the salt-water area depends on fishing and on trading. From the
fifteenth to the late nineteenth century, the Eastern Jjy speakers developed city-states and
acted as middlemen between European traders on the coast and the peoples living in the
interior; contact with Europeans is, therefore, no novelty to Jjp peoples. 146th European
penetration of the interior, and particularly with direct access to the palm oil producing
areas, the Ijy monopoly of trade collapsed.3 T h e fresh-water areas were never so depen-
dent on trade, relying mainly, as they still do, on agriculture supplemented by fishing.
Nowadays, the whole area suffers from lack of roads and industry, and has been classified
by the Nigerian Government as a Special Development Area. T h e discovery of oil in
various parts of the delta offers at least limited opportunities for employment to the
inhabitants of the area.
  0.2  DIALECTS
  The Ijy language is considerably differentiated into dialects, which form what C. F.
Hockett calls an L-complex (A COURSE IN MODERN LINGUISTICS,        323-4; New York, 1958).
A preliminaly dialect survey has been made, but the results have not yet been fully
analysed; the classification which follows is therefore a tentative one.
  Each dialect is at least partially intelligible with several others, but those from the
extreme east of the Ijy area are not mutually intelligible with those from the west. Two
main groups of dialects, Eastern and Central, are distinguished. Eastern dialects are
spoken in the eastern part of the salt-water area, where the development of trade drew
people into larger and more centralized political units; their dialects became more sharply
differentiated than those of the less-centralized fresh-water area. T h e two main groups
of dialects are subdivided as follows:
I. EASTERN
A. South-Eastern:
  I . Ralabari, spoken in Abonnema, Buguma, Bakana, Tombia, and their villages.","[1, 2, 3, 4]"

 2.1.12   The aspect markers consist of a number of verb suffixes occurring either singly
or in combination with each other or with the verb roots timiz 'continuous action' or
weriz 'past state'. Rather than introduce these morphemes immediately, it is convenient
to analyse them into combinations of fonr aspects with three tenses (with the addition of
a fifth aspect to which tense is irrelevant). T h e aspect-tense combinations are then
mapped into morphemes in the morphophonemics (6.5.1). The aspects are simple (S),
immediate (I), continuous (C), stative (St), and habitual (Hab); the first fonr of these

"  1.4.3 Consonants are distributed in syllables and units. T h e great majority of Kolo-
kuma syllables can be summarized in the formula
                                           'I'
                                      (C) V (N),
where C=consonant, V=vourel, T=tone, N=nasalization, and parentheses indicate
optional clcments. A few syllab!es do not fit this formula:
  (a) As noted in 1.3.1, some unit-initial syllables consist of nasalization+tone.
  (b) A few syllables end in a consonant; units containing such syllables are loanwords,
ideophones or interjections :
      baptiizi4      baptize
      dibdibdib4 freshly-cut and oozing
      6s os          cry to shoo fowls
  (c) A few units beginning with voiceless plosive+high vowel+ r have variants without
the vou,cl: pjrjl or pril 'give'. Such forms are probably dialect borrowings from North-
Western Ij?, and the longer form is used throughout this study.
  1.4.4 T h e distribution of consonants within the unit is not regulated as rigidly as that
of the vowels, but it is statistically though not absolutely limited. Table 4 shows what
combinations of first and second consonant (CI and Cz) were found in a tabulation of
559 units, each of which contained two consonants. (The first consonant may he either
initial or preceded by a vowel.)

for the limited distribution of -lqand, and, by allowing the occurrence of pronouns
after modifiers, removes a restriction on their distribution.                                    6.1.4 I n all other cases where a pronoun precedes     ++,     only a possessive form is
