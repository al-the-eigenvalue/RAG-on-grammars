       <into the back yard of the house.>        The 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause in (7) line d. is a Barbareno
example of what Thompson and Longacre (1985:182-183) refer to as a
 'before' clause. The event in a 'before' clause has not yet happened by the
time that the event denoted by the main clause has happened. Thompson and
Longacre argue that, for this reason, the event named in the 'before' clause
is conceptually negative from the point of view of the main clause event. For
this reason, it is not unusual to find a morpheme of negation or negative
polarity (e.g. English any or ever) in a 'before' clause. In Barbareho, the
negative prefix e- occurs in the main verb of the 2akimpi 'during' clause.","[165, 166]"
"1.9.2.3 Conditional relations
       Generally, an adverbial clause that provides the condition(s) under
which the event/state in the main clause occurs is analyzed in this dissertation
as a conditional clause. However, as discussed earlier, conditional relations can
be conflated with temporal relations in Barbareno, with the result that the
clause in question may not be a true conditional clause, even if it has an
adverbial conjunction that Harrington translates as ‘if’. In identifying a                                                 21
conditional clause, then, I looked for the following factors: (i) the adverbial
clause must code a hypothetical, i.e. unreal, situation; and, (ii) the main clause
must have one or more of the following features (following Givén 1990:829)
all of which underscore the irrealis nature of conditional constructions: the
modal verb uniyiw ‘to be necessary, to have to, should', the modal verb
alaqway      ‘can, to be able', the future tense prefix sa?-, the modal particle
may ‘would, should', a marker of certainty such as the particle pa ‘must be,
must have', the hortative particle kuhhe 'let it not be (that)', the particle
kimini 'then (in that case)', an imperative verb, an indirect request, or a
question. Negation in the main clause was another criterion I considered, since
in some languages all clauses that have negation are treated as irrealis (T.
Payne 1997). I decided not to treat negation as one of the structural criteria
in the identification of a conditional relation. However, in those cases where
I gave a conditional interpretation based on a pragmatic interpretation of the
context, i.e. where none of the above structural criteria were found in the
associated main clause, it was almost always the case that the main clause had
negation. These judgment calls were rare, however.
        Following Givén (1990:831) a counterfactual conditional relation was
identified as one in which: (i) the adverbial clause has a firm and negative
truth-value; (ii) the adverbial clause has a realis operator such as the past
tense suffix -wa5; and finally, (iii) the main clause has an irrealis operator
such as future tense or a modal particle. Counterfactual clauses are rare in my
corpus, however.
        The passage below has several conditional clauses: a conditional na
clause (line a.), a conditional haku clause (line c.), and a counterfactual
conditional haku clause (line f.).","[43, 44]"

"The conditional clause ‘if Domi hadn’t (come)' has negation in the form of
the contraction -n’t on the verb had. Negation in Barbareno Chumash always
appears in the form of the prefix -e-. As we will see shortly, in the
counterfactual conditional clause in (9) line f., this negative prefix is seen in
the verb s-e-2u8""02-was '{if] she hadn’t let (him)'.
        In the narrative below there are three preposed conditional clauses.
The first one (line a.) sets the scene with the hypothetical scenario of an old
man wanting to hold a baby. The second preposed conditional clause (line c.)
explores a possible option within this hypothetical scenario, one in which the
old man has some kind of power in his blood that would necessitate him
holding the baby for only a brief moment. Finally, the counterfactual
conditional clause in line f. gives a counter-consideration, a hypothetical
scenario in which the mother had not let the old man hold the baby at all, and
all the consequences that would result from that.",[455]

         Not all main clauses that have negation or some other irrealis operator,
such as an imperative mode in the verb or the future tense prefix sa?~, have
a Su adverbial clause that has the future tense prefix.* With only 5 of the 53
tokens of Gu clauses showing the future tense prefix, it is difficult to know
what accounts for its presence. As we will see in chapter 12, all of the Gukanu
 ‘so that, in order to' clauses have the future tense prefix. The difference in
frequency of the future tense prefix is thus one of the major morphosyntactic
differences between these two purposive adverbial clause types.
       Of the 53 u clauses, 12 or 23% have the negative prefix e-. They
always translate with the phrase 'so that... not..'. These adverbial clauses
tend to be associated with main clauses that code deontic necessity. That is,
the participant coded as the main clause subject is obliged to do something in
order to avoid an unpleasant result. In most cases, the main clause subject is
second person singular, indexed on the verb with the second person prefix p-.
The main clause will also typically have the modal verb uniyiw 'to be
necessary, to have to, should' as well as the future tense prefix sa?-.
Illustrations of this pattern are given in (20) through (22).
        The main clause in (20) line c. states what one ought to do if beans fell
on the floor. The Gu purpose clause in line d. has the negative prefix e-.","[275, 276]"

                                       Chapter 13                            ku ‘lest; so that...not' Clauses         Thompson and Longacre (1985:188) note that some languages have a
special conjunction for negative purpose clauses. An example in English is the
negative purpose conjunction ‘lest '. In Barbarenho Chumash, that conjunction
is ku 'lest, so that..not'. The Ku adverbial clause type is rare, with only two
tokens in the corpus. Yet, it is worth a brief discussion because it shares some
semantic space with negated Gu 'so that, in order to' purposive clauses
(chapter 11) as well as with haku '‘if' conditional clauses (chapter 7).
         The ku conjunction probably has a historical connection with the
conjunction haku 'if', found in conditional and semantically neutral relations.
Adverbial clauses with the conjunctions ku and haku are alike in that both
clause types code unreal, hypothetical situations. But whereas haku clauses
may code a condition, ku clauses code the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action. Specifically with ku clauses, the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action is to avoid an undesirable situation.
         It is not entirely clear what the difference in meaning would be for a
purpose clause that has the ku conjunction versus a clause that has the Gu
 'so that, in order to' conjunction and the negative prefix e-. In line c. of the
first example below, Mary Yee offered two ways of saying a purposive clause
in which these two conjunctions were contrasted. Harrington noted that these
minimal pairs were ‘carefully contrasted' (59.0586), but he did not state
whether Yee preferred one over the other.","[311, 312]"
"The   conditional   clause    in line     d.    ‘but    if they    don’t   come   down',    has
significant lexical overlap with the clause that immediately precedes it, ' they
come down right away'. It thus establishes an explicit contrast with the
preceding material. The second contrastive conditional, '[Because] if they
don’t escape the freshet' (line f.), does not explicitly link up to anything in the
prior text. It establishes a contrast with the implicit assumption, in the
preceding discourse, that the salamanders instinctively know to escape the
freshet by climbing up the hill before a big rain and staying on the hill until
the rain stops.
       Negation that is involved in establishing contrasts does not necessarily
have to appear in the conditional clause, as it does in examples (9) and (10).
For example, in (11) line b., the negative prefix e- appears in an independent
clause, preceding the conditional clause in line c.",[458]

Emphatic glottalization is often encliticized onto the final syllable, and an
epenthetic /?/ begins the word if it is otherwise vowel initial. The imperative
form of kutiy takes a slightly different form when its meaning includes a
third singular object. In such cases it ends with /l/ instead of /y/.       kutiyit                   ""look at me!*

"Ways in which point of view ts coded
       Four adverbial clause conjunctions were found to have a significant role
in coding the narrator’s or speaker’s stance, point of view, or expectations
about when and whether a given event had occurred, could occur, or would
occur. Generally, when the haku ‘if' conjunction is used, the event or
situation named in the adverbial clause is believed to be very unlikely but not
altogether impossible. When the na 'if; when' conjunction is used, the event
or situation is believed to be possible indeed, but it is not necessarily expected
to occur. When the mali 'when' conjunction is used, the connotation is that
the event or situation is not only likely to occur, but it may also be expected
to occur. The conjunction wa ‘if; when' seems to be used when the speaker
does not wish to frame a given event or situation from his or her own
perspective, expectations, or experience. One reason for the speaker’s
reluctance could be that he or she does not have enough first-hand evidence                                                          350
or personal experience to make claims concerning the matter under discussion.
The conjunction wa also appears to be used when the speaker wishes to
refrain from making any assumptions about what another person or entity can
dc or will do,
            do. In
                ¥
                   other
                    +
                         words, the speaker is not asserting his or her own
personal stance when he or she uses a wa adverbial clause.
        The usage of the wa ‘if; when' conjunction is similar to the usage of
the na ‘if; when' conjunction in certain respects. The na conjunction can be
used to express a neutral stance, or a neutral expectation, about what another
person or entity will do or is able to do. However, whereas the na conjunction
implies that the speaker is speaking from his or her own perspective (however
neutral), the use of the wa conjunction seems to imply that, whatever the
speaker is saying, it is not something he or she is framing from his or her own
perspective.
        At least three of the four adverbial clause conjunctions mentioned
above (wa    ‘if; when', na   ‘if; when'    and haku   'if') can be combined with
other adverbial clause conjunctions to convey even more subtle distinctions in
the speaker’s stance or perspective. We saw, for example, that the conjunction
wa can be combined with the adverbial clause conjunction 2akay hu ‘until’.
The result is still an adverbial clause that codes a terminal temporal boundary,
but the conjunction wa adds an additional layer of meaning. It says that the
speaker’s own perspective is not adequate for determining when the terminal,
temporal event has happened, or whether it even can happen; rather, the
perspective necessary is that of someone else, specifically that of the referent
that is coded as the subject of the adverbial clause. Also, the concessive
conjunction 2iyeme ‘though; even if' may combine with either haku 'if'
or na   ‘if; when’   to form different kinds of concessive conditional relations.
Though there were not enough tokens of the 2iyemhe 'though; even if'
clause type to allow strong claims about the exact meanings that could be
conveyed, there is little doubt that Barbareho Chumash speakers were able
to make subtle distinctions in concessive and concessive conditional meanings
by varying the combination of these conjunctions and other morphosyntax.
        Understanding how expectations and points of view are conveyed by
adverbial clause conjunctions is a difficult task, especially when the language
in question is no longer spoken and all of the data come from monologic
narratives. It would be doubtless enlightening to see how these conjunctions
were used in interactional contexts such as conversation. The analyses I have
offered give at best a glimpse of the ways that Barbareho Chumash people
once used these conjunctions to express, or to refrain from expressing, their
expectations and points of view.","[372, 373]"

2.2.1.1   Person and number
         Pronominal affixes show a nominative-accusative pattern. As Ono
(1996) has argued, these affixes are truly referential pronouns. They should
not be thought of as agreement markers, which serve only to copy certain
features of independent NPs. An utterance can be complete with just the verb
and its affixes, because the pronominal affixes already indicate who or what
is being talked about.
         The prefixes index the subject of the verb, distinguishing three persons
(first, second, and third person) and four numbers (singular, dual, plural, and
indefinite or unspecified). Table 5 lists the subject pronominal prefixes.","[63, 64]"

8.1 na clauses that code conditional relations
        Conditional na clauses make up 31.4% of the total na clause tokens.
Within this group 8% (5 tokens) are postposed and 92% (56 tokens) are
preposed. In a conditional relation, the adverbial clause names a hypothetical
or unreal situation which provides the condition under which the main clause
event or state occurs. Crosslinguistically there are certain structural indicators
in a given language that point to a conditional relation (Thompson and
Longacre 1985; Givén 1990). One tends to find in the main clause certain
affixes, particles, and lexical items that underscore the irrealis nature of the
conditional relation. As mentioned previously, for Barbareno Chumash these
include the future tense prefix sa?-, the modal particle may 'would; should;
might', the modal verbs uniyiw ‘to be necessary, to have to, should' or
alaqway 'can, to be able', and markers that point to the speaker’s level of
certainty such as pa 'must be, must have, probably, likely', kalpas
 ‘certainly’, or 2inu 'surely; (be) true'. In addition to these kinds of irrealis
operators identified in Givén 1990:829, Barbareno has a rare particle,
kimini, roughly translated as 'in that case; if so; then', which occurs in the
main clause in lieu of any of the irrealis operators indicated above.
         Unlike the main clause, which has one or several markers that
underscore the conditional relation, the na adverbial clause itself is typically
devoid of any structural markers that might point to such a relation. Also,
there is almost always a lack of tense and aspect marking in na clauses that
code a conditional relation.
         In many of the na clauses analyzed here as conditional, Harrington
sometimes translated the na conjunction as 'when', other times as 'if'. As
explained in Chapter 1, my criteria for identifying a conditional clause depend
upon independently-occuring structural factors like the ones noted above.
While Harrington’s translation is helpful in understanding the meaning of a
given word or clause, it cannot be taken as the sole criterion. The factors that
are criterial in identifying a Barbareno conditional clause are illustrated in the
examples that follow.
          In the brief text in (1), Mary Yee tells about two omens that concern
spasms around the eye. The adverbial clauses in lines a. and c. name a
hypothetical situation, and the corresponding main clauses underscore the
irrealis nature of the relation via the future tense prefix sa2-.","[209, 210]"

2.3 Syntax
        In Barbarenho, a clause with full subject and object NPs generally has
a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) structure. Most clauses have at most one full
NP, however (Ono 1996). The verb-initial word order occurs in independent
clauses as well as dependent clauses, such as complement clauses, relative
clauses, and adverbial clauses. Preverbal NPs are pragmatically marked and
are typically not part of the clause that follows. Usually these NPs are set off
by topic or focus particles. Finally, nominalized clauses are common in
Chumash languages. These may occur as subject or object complements,
relative clauses, part of cleft constructions, or as free NPs.
        The following topics are treated in 2.3: basic clause structure (2.3.1),
two-verb predicates (2.3.2), the morphosyntax of nominalized clauses (2.3.3),
pragmatically-marked constructions (2.3.4), complement-taking predicates and
their complement clauses (2.3.5), relative clauses (2.3.6), and appositive
clauses (2.3.7). The chapter ends with examples of coordination in 2.3.8.","[90, 91]"

further illustrated in (13). The main clause subject in line a. is a man, indexed

of bowl called a stuk. The Gukanu clause subject in line b. is the stuk itself.
The adverbial clause pronoun s- is not retained, because the main clause
subject (the stuk maker) has complete control over what happens to the
adverbial clause subject (the stuk) in the adverbial clause event. ((Cf. also

"1.5 Theoretical orientation
         This dissertation is based on a functionally-oriented approach to
linguistics. A functionally-oriented approach seeks to understand language in
all of its cognitive, communicative, socio-cultural and diachronic aspects. It is
the complex way in which these aspects of language interact that accounts for
the patterns observed in human languages, both individually and on a cross-
linguistic basis. The complex interaction of these aspects of language is best
seen in the ways language is actually used. Hence, when linguists who follow
this approach seek to describe and explain why certain forms or structures
pattern as they do in a given language, they want to work with as much
context of the language as possible. They seek to have a database that is built
upon connected discourse rather than only single forms and structures elicited
out of context, the latter being the standard for some schools of linguistics.
Thus if the language under investigation has a community of speakers, a
functionally-oriented linguist will seek to record as many genres of naturally
occurring discourse as possible, including conversation and the telling of
stories. Such recordings are audiotaped and/or videotaped, and are
subsequently transcribed in a systematic way (e.g. Du Bois et al. 1993). From
such data, both qualitative analyses (e.g. Chafe 1980) and quantitative analyses                                        5
(e.g. Givén 1983, Du Bois 1987, Fox and Thompson 1990 and Ford 1993
among many others) are possible.
        One broad area of functional approaches to linguistics that is used in
this dissertation is the theory of INFORMATION FLOW (Chafe       1976, 1987,   1992,
 1994). According to this theory, the changing cognitive state of information in
the minds of the speaker and hearer motivate particular linguistic forms and
structures. For example, newly mentioned referents are commonly coded as
full NPs, because in this form the hearer is able to identify who the speaker
is talking about. Subsequent mentions of the same referent usually take
pronominal form, e.g. English 'he', 'she', 'it'. These forms of the referent
reflect its Given cognitive status. This theory is particularly helpful in part four
of this dissertation as we examine the relationship between mentions of
referents and clausal ordering in adverbial clause constructions.
        The theory of information flow is connected to some extent to the
principle of least effort in the production and processing of language (Zipf
1935). This principle, along with the functionally-oriented notion of iconic and
economic motivation in language (Haiman 1983) will be shown to be relevant
in understanding the various patterns one finds with initial and final adverbial
clauses in Barbareno discourse, in parts three and four of the dissertation.","[27, 28]"
"1.6 Literature review
       Taken as a whole, the literature on adverbial clauses is immense. This
topic has been written about from vastly different perspectives not only within
linguistics, but within other fields of learning such as philosophy. As discussed
in section 1.8, my data on Barbareno adverbial clauses occur within narrative
discourse. Most of the vast literature on adverbial clauses, however, deals with
constructed data. I am particularly interested in studies that examine adverbial
clauses within a discourse context, such as monologic narrative or
conversation, because such studies focus on questions and issues that are most
relevant to a functionally-oriented perspective on language. The following are
some of the sources that inform my descriptions and analyses of adverbial
clauses in Barbarefo, though these of course are not the whole extent of my
references to the adverbial clause literature in the dissertation: Haiman 1978,
Chafe 1984, Thompson 1985, Thompson and Longacre 1985, Ford and
Thompson 1986, Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990, and Ford
1993,
        Some of the sources mentioned above give an overview of adverbial
clauses from a functional and cross-linguistic perspective. Givén (1990)
discusses adverbial clauses in his chapter on interclausal coherence. First he                                         6
gives a typology of adverbial clauses by semantic category, i.e. temporal,
conditional, cause and reason, concessive, substitutive, additive, and purposive.
Following that is a discussion about participial adverbial clauses, which are a
type of adverbial clause that does not have a specific semantic relation.
Finally, he discusses the functions that adverbial clauses are known to have in
the coherence and grounding of discourse, with a specific focus on the
differences between preposed and postposed adverbial clauses. Most if not all
of the examples in Givén 1990 are constructed sentences. Still, this source
provides a good starting point for ways in which to analyze adverbial clause
data.
       An extensive taxonomy of adverbial clauses from a cross-linguistic
perspective is given in Thompson and Longacre 1985. Adverbial clause
constructions are defined as 'a set of two-clause constructions in which one
clause can be said to modify the other in a way similar to the way in which an
adverb modifies a proposition' (p. 171). This article has two parts. Part I
discusses in detail the types of adverbial clauses found around the world.
These are labeled according to the kinds of semantic relationships that they
signal,   specifically:     time,   location,   manner,   purpose,    reason,
circumstantial/means,     simultaneous, conditional, concessive, substitutive,
additive, and absolutive. Thompson has since discarded the absolutive
category.’ With each semantic category of adverbial clause, Thompson and
Longacre describe and explain certain structural or morphosyntactic
regularities that one usually finds associated with them. Part I of the study also
highlights similarities between the types of adverbial clauses and other kinds
of syntactic structures, for example juxtaposed clauses, that can convey similar
meanings.      There is also some discussion of borrowed subordinators;
specifically, the factors that lead to one language borrowing an adverbial
clause conjunction from another language. Part II of the Thompson and
Longacre study examines adverbial clauses from a discourse perspective in
monologic texts. It focuses on the ways in which adverbial clauses are relevant
to the structure of paragraphs and of the discourse as a whole. The issues and
questions addressed in Thompson and Longacre 1985, regarding both specific
types of adverbial clauses as well as specific functions, are a useful heuristic
for anyone planning a case study on adverbial clauses.
         Chafe 1984 explores how intonation contours and punctuation units
reflect the extent to which an adverbial clause is bound to its main clause, in
English written and conversational discourse. If both an adverbial clause and
its main clause occur in the same intonation or punctuation unit, the adverbial
clause is said to be 'bound'. Otherwise, it is said to be 'free'. This study                                        7
 compares four types of adverbial clauses: preposed clauses that are free,
 preposed clauses that are bound; postposed clauses that are free, and
 postposed clauses that are bound. A major finding was that adverbial clauses
 that are bound are almost always postposed. Chafe explains this tendency
 through the theory of Information Flow. The intonation/punctuation unit is the
 domain of information flow, with information flowing from the old or familiar
 to the new or unfamiliar. When two clauses fall under a single contour, it is
 likely that only one of the clauses will convey new or unfamiliar information.
 Chafe found that the postposed adverbial clauses contained the new or
unfamiliar information. A second important finding is that free adverbial
 clauses are much more common than bound adverbial clauses. Free adverbial
clauses tend to occur initially, however, because they function as 'guideposts'
to information flow, 'signaling a path or orientation in terms of which the
following information is to be understood ' (p. 444). This, according to Chafe,
is probably the prototypical function of adverbial clauses. For the free
adverbial clauses that occur postposed, Chafe found other explanations. Some
were afterthoughts. Other free, postposed adverbial clauses functioned to
modify only the latter part of the preceding main clause, rather than modifying
the entire main clause. This suggests, according to Chafe, that '...the modified
portion of the main clause [is] not even clearly articulated in the speaker’s
mind until the main clause was completed' (p. 447). The findings in Chafe’s
study are incorporated into the issues and questions I address in parts three
and four of this dissertation.
         Ford 1993 is an entire monograph devoted to the discourse functions
of adverbial clauses in American English conversation, using the sociological
framework of conversation analysis. Focusing on prosody and interaction
within a conversational context, the author examines the distribution and
discourse functions of temporal, conditional, and causal (reason) adverbial
clauses. There are two main conclusions. The first is that preposed adverbial
clauses play a significant, global role in the structuring of a discourse. The
second is that postposed adverbial clauses have a local role of modifying the
proposition of the preceding main clause, without affecting the overall
organization of the discourse. These conclusions are echoed throughout all of
the literature on adverbial clauses reviewed here, including those studies using
monologic data. Ford’s other findings are that conditional clauses are most
often initial, while temporal and causal (reason) clauses are most often final.
The reasons for these distributions are discussed in terms of factors that are
specific to talk-in-interaction, e.g. the system of turn-taking, problems in
understanding and agreement between speaker and hearer, the need to soften                                       8
assertions, personal motivations, listener prompts, etc. None of these factors
are directly applicable to the data in my Barbareno corpus. However,
throughout the book Ford makes specific predictions or generalizations about
the functions of initial and final temporal, conditional, and causal clauses.
These predictions provide another perspective that has proven useful to my
analyses of the Barbareno data in parts three and four of the dissertation.
        Haiman 1978 is a crosslinguistic study of the connection between
conditional clauses and topics. The author finds that, very often among
unrelated languages, conditional clauses and topics resemble each other in
marking and in function. Haiman notes that this similarity is at first surprising,
since topics and conditional clauses are structures that one would not normally
think to be related. Haiman’s discussion follows the premise that similarity in
structure must reflect a similarity in meaning since '...grammars tend to miss
semantic generalizations, rather than to create spurious ones' (p. 565). He
compares traditional definitions of conditional clauses in the philosophical
literature with definitions of 'topic' found in linguistics literature, and finds
that the definitions are similar. Topics and conditional clauses are found to be
unchallengeable and thereby ‘constitute the framework which has been
selected for the following discourse’ (pp. 583,585). In other words, both are
pragmatically presupposed (Givén 1990:830). The main conclusions from this
study are that conditional clauses and topics belong to the same category, and
that conditional clauses are the topics, i.e. givens or presuppositions, of the
sentences in which they occur. As Givén (1990:846) notes, this comparison of
adverbial clauses and topics can only go so far. Prototypical nominal topics
tend to be highly recurrent and important, i.e. anaphoric and cataphoric,
whereas adverbial clauses are rarely recurrent. Still, Haiman’s observations are
relevant to Barbareho data in that many initial adverbial clauses precede the
topic marker 21. This is especially true of those adverbial clauses that express
a conditional relation. The foregoing is the extent of the insight that Haiman
1978 provides for the purposes of my study, however, since his data consist of
sentences constructed in isolation.
        Ford and Thompson 1986 is a study of the discourse function of
conditionals in both spoken and written texts. One of the central aims of that
study is to test Haiman’s (1978) proposal that conditionals have the same
function as topics. The authors found that there are several functions that
conditional clauses may have in discourse contexts. Most of these are
associated with conditionals that occur in initial position. Like topics, initial
conditionals serve as a framework of shared information for the following
discourse. First, initial conditionals may be used to repeat claims voiced earlier                                        9
in the discourse. A different, second function is that they may establish
contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse. Or, third, they can be
used to introduce particular cases exemplifying preceding generalizations.
Finally, initial conditionals may also function to offer other options or points
of view that are relevant to those of the preceding discourse. Final
conditionals, unlike initial conditionals, seem to be motivated by factors that
have little to do with the need for a shared frame of reference. For example,
the length of the conditional clause can affect whether it is initial or final;
lengthy ones tend to be final. If the conditional clause is embedded within
another clause then it tends to be postposed, and its scope is limited to the
embedded clause. Also, important or lengthy subjects in the consequent clause
tend to be initial rather than final, which means that the conditional clause has
to be final. Ford and Thompson also found that final conditionals tend to
follow main clauses that express an evaluation or question, though they cannot
explain why this should be so. Final conditional clauses do not play as
important a role in organizing the frame of a discourse as initial conditionals
do; they are not pivotal points in the development of a discourse. One notable
function of final conditionals, however, is that they often function to introduce
afterthoughts or serve as reminders. In conversational texts, conditionals are
used to make polite requests, or otherwise make a given point of view appear
less dogmatic or intrusive. The texts in my Barbareno database are not
conversational texts. Nonetheless, the Ford and Thompson study provides
many insights that have been incorporated into chapter 21 of this dissertation.
         Thompson 1985 is a seminal study of the discourse properties of
purpose clauses in written English texts. The author focuses on the different
discourse functions of initial and final purpose clauses. Her main findings are
that initial and final purpose clauses have radically different roles with respect
to the organization of the discourse, even though both types of clauses have
a similar structure:        '...the initial purpose clause functions to state a ""problem"" within
       the context of expectations raised by the preceding discourse, to which
       the following material (often many clauses) provides a solution, while
       the final purpose clause plays the much more local role of stating the
       purpose for which the action named in the immediately preceding
       clause is performed' (p. 55).","[28, 29, 30, 31, 32]"
"Though all three cleft constructions consist of an NP followed by a
nominalized clause, in only one of the cleft constructions does the nominalized
clause have the same form as typical, nominalized relative clauses in
Barbareno. I refer to these three kinds of clefts in the following way: i) true
clefts; ii) pseudo clefts; and iii) hi clefts. True clefts and pseudo clefts have
nominalized clauses that begin with the stative clitic ka=; hi clefts have
nominalized clauses that begin with the focus clitic hi= (not to be confused
with the dependent clitic hi=). These cleft constructions are illustrated in turn.e True clefts
       In true cleft constructions, the clefted NP either has the stative prefix
2al-, as seen in (282) and (283) below, or it has the predicating particle
?akay (glossed 'cLeFrr'), as seen in (284). In both cases the clefted NP is

         Structurally, there is one difference between true clefts and pseudo
clefts. In pseudo clefts, the clefted NP is ""bare"" in the sense that it does not
have the stative prefix 2a1-, nor is it preceded by the predicating particle
?akay. Also, pseudo clefts are much more frequent in the corpus than true
clefts. Two illustrations of a pseudo cleft are given in (285) and (286). (For
further examples of pseudo clefts see the set of elicitations in (273).)(285)   ho?s,pey,

2.3.4.4    Questions
       Questions and answers to questions can take the form of pragmatically-
marked constructions seen in hi clefts. The questioned element precedes the
nominalized verb, as in the paired expressions in (289) and (290).","[107, 108, 109, 110]"
"Linkage such as this tends to occur between successive paragraphs in a
discourse, and has been called tail-head linkage (Longacre 1968, Thompson
and Longacre 1985). An event mentioned in the last sentence (the 'tail') of
a paragraph is picked up and mentioned again in the first sentence (the
 ""head') of the next paragraph. Initial temporal clauses are often the means
by which the linkage occurs. Back-reference occurs primarily through lexical
overlap. It often involves repetition or a paraphrase of the event denoted by
the verb in the preceding sentence, as in (1) above with the event ‘eat
breakfast '. Such recapitulative lexical overlap provides cohesion with previous
material in the text (Thompson and Longacre 1985, Thompson 1987:449).
        Several examples of linkage through overt back-reference in Barbareno
Chumash are presented below. The example in (2) gives the first 13 lines of
a procedural text. In this text, Yee tells how her ancestors made tobacco
amulets. The tail-head linkage process starts with the postposed temporal
clause in line c. (the tail), ‘until it got thick like pitch', and proceeds with the
preposed temporal clause in line d. (the head), 'And when it got thick"". In
this linkage one sees a repetition of two key lexical items: the particle moke
 ‘already' and the verb with its subject prefix, s-polon ‘it is thick’.",[481]

                                   Chapter 24                              Concluding Remarks         In this dissertation I described and explained the various patterns one
finds in the grammar of adverbial clauses in Barbareno Chumash, from a
functionally-oriented perspective of language. I used thirteen, structurally-
distinguishable adverbial clause types as a starting point. I gave a detailed
account of the kinds of semantic relations coded by these adverbial clause
types and the morphosyntactic patterns one finds associated with the semantic
relations within each clause type. I then compared the initial and final tokens
of these types with respect to similarities and differences in structure, extent
of scope, and punctuation/intonation boundaries. Finally, I focussed on the
similarities and differences in discourse functions between initial and final
clauses that code purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral
relations.
         It is interesting to consider the areas of adverbial clause grammar
where Barbareno Chumash differs from other languages, the areas of
adverbial clause grammar where it shows striking similarities with other
languages, and why it is that the differences and similarities appear where they
do. For example, Barbareno Chumash grammar codes the same kinds of
semantic relations one finds in other languages: temporal, conditional, neutral
(which many researchers treat as conditional), concessive, manner,
reason/causal, and purposive. Many languages code these semantic categories
in adverbial clauses, but the ways in which they code them can be quite
different. To illustrate this point, I will highlight some of the differences with
regard to temporal and conditional/neutral relations.
         English has the conjunctions before and after, which denote respectively
a precedence (posteriority) relation, where the main clause event precedes the
adverbial clause event, and a subsequence (anteriority) relation, where the
main clause event occurs subsequent to the adverbial clause event. Barbareno
Chumash does not have temporal conjunctions that mean 'before' or
 ‘after’, but instead uses the general, non-temporally specific conjunction
mali 'when' in both cases, in combination with other morphosyntax that
further specifies the temporal relation. Thus in terms of the variety of
temporal conjunctions that can be used to code precedence and subsequence
temporal relations, English is more explicit than Barbareno Chumash.","[578, 579, 580]"

       <and finally poison the mother.>        In line c. above, the haku 'if' clause codes the hypothetical situation
of there being the power of a spirit helper in the old man’s blood. The main
clause of this adverbial construction is in line e. It denotes the situation that
is supposed to occur, i.e: that the old man should quickly hand the child back
to its mother, if the hypothetical situation stated in the haku 'if' clause
applies. The main clause in line e. has both the modal verb uniyiw ‘to be
necessary, to have to, should' and the future tense morpheme sa?-. Both of
these morphemes are irrealis operators which underscore the conditional
meaning of that adverbial clause construction.                         .
        The only token of a counterfactual conditional haku 'if*' clause occurs
in line f., ""if she had not let the old man           hold the child’. It has several
features that identify it as a counterfactual conditional clause (following Givén
1990:831). First, the adverbial clause assumes a firm, not-pending, truth-value;
                                             178
its meaning assumes that the mother did indeed let the old man hold the
baby. Also importantly, the adverbial clause has a negative truth-value, in that
it posits a hypothetical scenario that did not happen. Another criterion that

operators typically found in a counterfactual clause. Finally, the main clause
in line g. has an irrealis operator, the verb s-apaékaws ‘it is fast and
unforeseen; it happens quick and unexpectedly'. This verb makes reference
to the fact that a future event, a necessarily unplanned for event, will happen.
        Another kind of irrealis operator often found in the main clause of a
conditional relation is a modal particle (Givén 1990:829). Two illustrations of
the Barbareho modal particle may ‘would; should; might' are given in (2)
and (3) below. In (2) we see a postposed haku 'if' clause. Its main clause

"        The example in (4) shows another kind of morphosyntactic marking
commonly found in the main clause of a conditional clause construction--a
marker of certainty (Givén 1990:829). The main clause in line c. has markers
of certainty in the form of the particle kalpas 'surely; certainly! and 2?inu
 ‘(be) true; sure; real'. The modal particle may ‘would; should; might'
appears in this main clause as well.",[202]
"
21.1.2 Establishing contrasts
        A second discourse function that conditional clauses are known to have
is that of establishing contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse
(Thompson and Longacre 1985:222-223, Ford and Thompson 1986, Ford
 1993). This function is another way that an initial conditional clause provides
a framework of shared information, through which the reader/listener
interprets the information in the immediately following discourse.
        This function of establishing contrasts could be subcategorized under
the broader function of exploring options and alternatives (Ford 1993:56-59).
Contrasts often involve pairs of initial adverbial clauses, the first one
introducing one option, the second one establishing a contrast or opposing
option to the first option (Ford 1993; see also Longacre 1976:105-106 on the
relation between two-pronged contrasts and 'but' structures). In addition, as
we will see, in the Barbareho data there is significant lexical overlap both in
conditionals that introduce options and in conditionals that introduce
contrasts. However, in the Barbareno data, negation is always directly involved
in creating the contrasts that initial conditional clauses help to establish, but
negation may or may not play a direct role in helping initial conditional
clauses create options and alternatives. For this reason I treat these two
functions as being separate, though they are related. The important ingredient
of negation is echoed in the schematic formula in (7), which Ford and
Thompson (1986:357) give for this discourse function (though Ford and
Thompson do not suggest that contrasting conditionals must have a morpheme
that signals negation).",[454]

        My general characterization of a prototypical adverbial clause is as
follows. First, an adverbial clause exists in a hypotactically dependent
relationship with one or more clauses. A HyPOTACTIC CLAUSE is one that is
dependent on a main clause but which is not embedded in the main clause.
As noted in Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, hypotactic dependence is an
important feature that distinguishes adverbial clauses from other kinds of
subordinate clauses, such as object- or subject complements and restrictive
relative clauses, which are embedded in their main clause. Thus a complement
clause is either a subject or object argument of a main clause verb, but an
adverbial clause is never an argument. A restrictive relative clause is a
constituent that makes up part of a larger noun phrase, but an adverbial
clause never serves as a constituent of a noun phrase.
        Second, unlike other kinds of hypotactically dependent clauses, such as
non-restrictive relative clauses and clauses of reported speech (the latter is not
to be confused with clauses of quoted speech), an adverbial clause can
normally appear before or after the main clause without a change in meaning.
Finally, as traditionally defined for two-clause constructions, an adverbial
clause is one that modifies another clause or sentence. As seen in the
literature review section, however, sentential modification does not begin to
 describe the kinds of functions an adverbial clause may have.
         A PREPOSED or initial adverbial clause is one that occurs before its main
 clause. A postroseEp or final adverbial clause is one that follows its main clause.
         Following now are general definitions and characterizations I use for
 the traditional terms that denote the semantic relation between an adverbial
 clause and its main clause. These definitions and characterizations are
 extrapolated from discussions in Thompson and Longacre 1985, Matthiessen
 and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990 and Ford 1993. A Tempora_ relation is one
 in which the event named by the main clause is anchored to the time of the
 event named by the adverbial clause. In a conpiTIonaL relation, the adverbial
 clause provides the condition(s) under which the event named by the main
 clause holds. Sometimes the semantic relation is conflated with respect to
 conditionality and time. I refer to such relations and the adverbial clauses that
 code them as NEUTRAL. In a concsssive relation, the adverbial clause expresses
 a situation that, from the narrator’s or protagonist’s point of view, would
‘under normal circumstances detract from or mitigate the situation expressed
 in the main clause. Or, as Thompson and Longacre (1985:198) state, it ""makes
 a concession against which the proposition in the main clause is contrasted.""
 In a purpose relation, the adverbial clause provides a purpose for which the
 event in the main clause is undertaken. Importantly however, as noted in                                         12
Thompson and Longacre 1985:185, the situation expressed in the adverbial
clause must be unrealized at the time of the event expressed in the main
clause. This restriction is a crucial difference between purpose and REASON
relations. In the latter, the situation in the adverbial clause is the reason for
the situation that obtains in the main clause, and it may already be realized
by the time the situation expressed by the main clause has occurred. Finally,
in a MANNER relation, the adverbial clause specifies the manner in which the
action or event of the main clause occurs.
        The foregoing are non-language-specific definitions for the semantic
categories of adverbial clauses analyzed in this dissertation. In section 1.9.2 I
discuss the methodology I use to determine which Barbareho adverbial clauses
have which of the semantic relations discussed above.","[33, 34, 35]"

        A truly thorough description of the Barbareho Chumash language has
yet to appear, but one may find a clear and concise orientation to Barbareno                                      4
discourse and grammar in Ono’s 1996 dissertation. Sketches and analyses of
the Barbareno language are also found in Beeler 1970a and 1976, and in the
extensive, detailed footnotes given in Beeler and Whistler 1980. Detailed
discussions on dependent marking, relative clauses and related structures are
given in Wash 1999a and 1999b. There are also discussions and illustrative
examples touching upon many aspects of Barbareho grammar in Harrington’s
notes, especially in Reel 3, Volume 3, of the Kraus Microfilm Reel Edition
(Mills and Brickfield 1986). In addition to these sources there are two articles
on the placement and functions of glottalization (Mithun et al. 1994, Ono et
al. 1994). Two studies have been published on sibilant harmony in Barbareho
(Beeler 1970b, Mithun 1997). Finally, there is a phonological study on
reduplication, which is a prominent phonological and grammatical process in
all Chumash languages (Wash 1995).
        No comprehensive dictionary of the Barbareno language has yet been
published. However, Beeler (1979) published a list of approximately 1,000
words, Whistler (1980) followed up on this work with a working dictionary
containing about 2,000 words. There is also a helpful glossary of terms from
several different Chumash languages. in volume five of the Hudson and
Blackburn (1986) series.","[26, 27]"

                                      Suzanne Wash
        This dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareno Chumash, an indigenous language of California. It explores the
semantic relations, morphosyntactic structure, and discourse functions of
adverbial clauses in this language, with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses crosslinguistically, and from a functionally-
oriented approach to linguistics. Almost all of the data come from narratives
recorded in the 1950s by John Harrington from Mary Yee, the last speaker of
the Barbareho Chumash language.
        The dissertation is divided into five parts. Part I is the preliminaries. It
includes a detailed grammatical sketch of the Barbareno Chumash language.
In Part II I analyze the semantic and morphosyntactic characteristics of
thirteen structurally-distinguishable adverbial clause types. The adverbial
clauses    code    temporal,   conditional,     concessive,    purposive,   reason/causal,
manner, and semantically neutral relations. Semantically neutral adverbial
clauses have both temporal and conditional meanings, and though most
researchers treat such clauses as conditional, in this study I treat them as a
category separate from the temporal and conditional categories. In Part TI I
compare the initial and final tokens of these clause types with respect to
similarities      and   differences    in       structure,    extent   of    scope,    and
punctuation/prosodic boundaries. In Part IV I focus on the similarities and
differences in discourse functions between initial and final clauses that code
purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral relations. In addition
to their qualifying role, the initial adverbial clauses function as pivotal points
of orientation that help create a cohesive and coherent text. However, the
final adverbial clauses only serve to qualify the main clause. They do not
function as pivotal points of orientation in a discourse. These differences
between initial and final adverbial clauses are found crosslinguistically, and
reflect the general cognitive processes involved in the production and
comprehension of discourse (Giv6n 1995). Finally, I conclude this study with
the closing remarks in Part V.                                                               ,                                              viii

1.1 Purpose of this study
         This dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareho Chumash, an indigenous language of California. The goals of the
dissertation are two-fold. First, it describes what adverbial clauses look like in
this language, sorting them into types that correspond to certain structural
criteria. Second, it explores discourse-functional explanations for the ways in
which the adverbial clauses pattern as they do in Barbareho Chumash
narratives. Both of these goals are met with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses cross-linguistically, in both their grammatical
and discourse-functional properties.
         Much has been published on adverbial clauses. Almost all studies on
adverbial clauses, however, use constructed sentences for data. Relatively few
studies have examined adverbial clauses within the context of non-constructed,
connected discourse, such as monologic narratives and conversation. This
dissertation not only examines adverbial clauses from a discourse context, but
it also provides a rare, in-depth look at adverbial clauses in an American
Indian language. For the reasons cited above, this study aims to be a worthy
contribution to the cross-linguistic literature on adverbial clauses and, more
generally, to discourse-functional perspectives on language.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

20.1 Initial purpose clauses
       As is true for initial purpose clauses in English (Thompson 1985), initial
purpose clauses in Barbareho Chumash generally function to state a problem
or goal, one which   results from    an expectation     oor assumption       expressed   irin thepreceding discourse. The solution typically involves a sequence of events that
form a procedure for achieving the goal named in the initial purpose clause.
Hence, initial purpose clauses tend to be found in procedural texts, or in
stretches of speech that describe a sequence of steps for accomplishing a given
goal.
        The excerpt in (1) describes the procedure for making a kind of home-
made candle, called      a candil, which the Chumash began to use soon after
the Spanish came to their land. The context preceding the initial purpose
clause is given in line a. We learn that there was a type of tallow candle
available for purchase, but it was a kind of candle that was not economical to
use. The Chumash used a more economical, home-made alternative called the
candil. Thus in the preceding context there arises the expectation and
assumption that there was a need for the candil, and that there must have
been a way for the Chumash to make it. The initial purpose clause in line b.
expresses the problem, 'To make a candil...', and serves as a link between
the preceding context in line a. and the sequence of events in lines c. through
x., Which delineate the procedure or ‘solution’ for making this kind of light
source.","[422, 423]"

the article 1= in the nominalized verb. There is one type of context in which
this replacement does not occur, and the nominalized clause retains full
subject marking on its verb. If there is a modifier or some kind of particle
preceding the verb, then the article will be attached to that element instead
of the verb. The verb is then inflected for person the same as it would be in
an independent clause. For example, the verbs in (268) and (269) are both
preceded by the particle howo 'still, yet'. In (268) the third person subject
is singular; in (269) the third person subject is plural. In both instances the
verbs retain the third person pronoun s-, while the article 1= is attached to
the particle howo ‘still, yet"".(268)   2?i2i-hai2?   saxik

           It should be emphasized that, in Barbareho Chumash, the verb within
a nominalized clause is not an attribute or modifier to any of its NP
arguments, in spite of the fact that an English translation almost always
                                                                                                *

declarative clause, a verb within a nominalized clause may or may not have
dependent arguments and adjuncts. Its meaning stays the same regardless of
whether it has dependent arguments and adjuncts. A better illustration of this
point is seen in the pair of nominalized clauses below, which are nearly
identical.(270)      ha-ku      s ams ,utakway

           <as s/he was undoing [the tie] from a house door,> 59.0460        These nominalized clauses are from different texts that discuss methods
of locking up homes and other structures long ago. In (270) the nominalized
verb has the object argument hi=l=ku          ‘a person, some person'. The
nominalized verb in (271), which differs only by having a past tense suffix,
does not have any NP arguments. Both nominalized clauses mean basically the                                                        79
same thing: 'one who was unknown! or 'one who they (indef.) did not
know '. In head-marking languages, especially, NPs that are clausal arguments
further delineate or elaborate upon the information encoded in the head verb.
Thus NPs within nominalized clauses are dependent elements on the verb and

        Nominalized clauses with a first or second person subject are relatively
infrequent in the corpus. Unlike nominalized clauses with a third person
subject, such clauses do not take the article 1=. Also, the pronoun is always
kept: k- if the subject is in first person, or p- if the subject is in second
person. Finally, these clauses always have the prefix -al-. This subordinator
appears mainly in constructions involving focussed or contrasted NPs,
appositions, questions, and relative clauses. Almost always, the subject of the
clause is in the first or second person; exceptions are rare.’ Below are some
examples of nominalized clauses with subjects in the first or second person.","[99, 100, 101, 102]"

        Thompson and Longacre (1985:198-199) state that there are two kinds
of concessive adverbial clauses: definite and indefinite. Definite concessive
clauses have a concessive conjunction like English ""although ' or Barbareno
Chumash ?iyeme. The indefinite concessive clauses typically contain an
indefinite pronoun or question word, such as 'whoever', 'what', or 'how',
as in 'No matter what he said, she still refused to go out with him' or
 ""Whoever he is, ’m not opening the door’ (1985:199). The example in (2)
above illustrates both the qualities of definite and indefinite concessive
clauses: it has the conjunction ?iyeme, and at the same time it has the
indefinite question word 2akay ‘how much'. None of the Barbareho
Chumash concessive clauses were found to have indefinite elements without
the conjunction 2iyeme.10.2 2iyeme clauses that code concessive conditional relations
         Several tokens of the 2? iyeme clause type code a concessive conditional
relation. Concessive conditional clauses are often referred to as ‘even if'
clauses (Thompson       and Longacre       1985, Givén 1990), as in the English
sentence ‘Even if it rains we'll have our picnic' (from Thompson and
Longacre 1985:196). Crosslinguistically, these clauses are similar to the regular
conditional clauses in a given language, but they carry a contrary-to-
expectation presupposition not normally found in the ordinary conditional
clauses for that language (Thompson and Longacre 1985). In Barbareno
Chumash, a concessive conditional clause has the conjunction 2iyewhe
 ‘although, though; even if"". (Cf. however example (8) in chapter 8, where the
adverbial clause has the conjunction 2iyena ‘if’, which leans toward a
concessive conditional meaning.) Also, it may be followed by the conjunction
haku 'if' or na ‘if in the same adverbial clause. The main clause may have
markers of irrealis modality, such as the future prefix sa2-, that underscore
the hypothetical nature of the conditional relation. An example is given in (3).
The concessive conditional clause in line b. also happens to be in medial
position. It appears to be in a dependent relation with the main clause
preceding it and the main clause following it.","[255, 256]"
"23.2.1.1 Referent tracking in the main clause
        In this category of final neutral clauses, the main clause is often
preceded by some sort of generic statement about how things are done or
used to be done long ago. The idea embodied in that preceding statement is
then tracked in the main clause as an unmarked third person subject, with the
predicate beginning with the stative prefix 2?al- instead of the third
pronominal prefix s-. The proposition in the main clause is either a comment
or an evaluation about the preceding material, and the final neutral clause
follows with further information that qualifies the main clause.
        The first illustration of this pattern is seen in (23). This text is about a
traditional remedy for relieving the effects of poison oak. The first three lines
refer to the main ingredient of the poison oak remedy and what process was                                         538
applied to it before putting it to use on the afflicted person. The neutral
clause construction begins in line d., with the main clause expressing an
evaluation about the remedy: ' it is good for one to cure with it'. The neutral
clause   than    fallauwsa   unth i   formation    ant tha     sirouma   tances   wndar    which «a

        In coding conditional/neutral relations, languages differ in the extent to
which their adverbial conjunctions code degrees of hypotheticality and the
speaker’s expectation about the likelihood that an event can or will occur.
English codes the distinction with two conjunctions: if and when. The
conjunction if indicates a lower degree of probability and expectation, or
higher degree of hypotheticality, and the conjunction when indicates a higher
degree of probability and expectation, or lower degree of hypotheticality. On
the other hand, Barbareho Chumash has three adverbial conjunctions that
code distinctions of hypotheticality and expectation. Events that denote the
lowest probability of ever occurring (= highest degree of hypotheticality) are
coded with the conjunction haku ‘if'. Events that have the most probability
of occurring (= lowest degree of hypotheticality) are coded with the
conjunction mali 'when'. Events that fall in the middle of the scale of
probability, expectation and hypotheticality are coded with the conjunction na
‘if; when'.   In   addition   to   these   three   conjunctions,   there   is   a fourth
conjunction, wa ‘if; when', that explicitly codes the fact that the speaker is
not taking a stance regarding any expectation or probability that an event can
occur or will occur. Thus in terms of the variety of adverbial conjunctions that
can code a speaker’s stance with regard to hypotheticality and probability,
Barbareho Chumash is more explicit than English.
         It is not surprising that languages may differ in the number of adverbial
conjunctions they use to code semantic relations, and in the finer or broader
distinctions they may make within such relations. These differences arise from
circumstances that are unique to each language in its history of use by a
community of speakers. On the other hand, as discussed in part IV, languages
show striking similarities in the ways that initial adverbial clauses build a
discourse, creating coherence among units of a text. The reason for these
similarities is that the coherence in the text reflects the coherence in the
cognitive processes that produce and comprehend the text, processes that all
humans share (see Givdn 1995 chapter 8, and the references to the
psychological literature he cites therein). I would therefore predict that further
case studies on adverbial clauses in other languages will prove to follow in this
pattern: that differences with other languages will be found in the more
localized, language-specific details of how the semantic relations are coded,
and similarities will be found in the more global, universal areas of the kinds
of tasks that initial and final adverbial clauses perform in the constructing of
a discourse.","[580, 581]"

result would be less preferable for reasons related to relevance in meaning
and ease of processing.
        First, the information expressed by the clause in line a. is immediately
relevant to the main clause in line b., because the clause in line b. predicates
something about it. The information expressed in line a. is only indirectly
relevant, however, to the information expressed by the final neutral adverbial
clauses in lines c. and d. The latter two clauses do not predicate anything
about the event of drinking sea water as such, they only express further
information about its medicinal uses. We would thus not expect to see the
conjoined adverbial clauses intervening between the clauses in lines a. and b.
        The second reason we would not expect to see a reversal of order has
to do with length. The two neutral adverbial clauses are conjoined into one,
lengthy syntactic unit: ‘iffwhen their bones broke and iffwhen they had
wounds '. At least one study on final adverbial clauses has shown that lengthy
conditional clauses tend to be final (Ford and Thompson 1986). The authors
suggest it may be more difficult to process lengthy, preposed, dependent
clauses that are much longer than their associated main clauses, though more
research is needed to determine the validity of such a hypothesis. This finding
might be especially applicable to spontaneous speech and spoken narratives,
particularly in VO languages.
        The main clause in (25), line b., continues tracking the referent ' elder
flower tea', which is mentioned throughout the preceding discourse. The
postposed adverbial clause in line c., 'ifAvhen you have a cold', provides
circumstantial information about its main clause event, 'and then you drink
this '.","[562, 563]"

clause. First, it denotes a hypothetical situation, ‘if an old man wants to hold
a baby', which serves as a condition under which the proposition in the main
                                              23
clause holds. Second, its main clause in line b. has the modal particle may
‘would,   should',   which   further    underscores   the   irrealis   meaning   of the
adverbial clause construction.
        The second conditional clause is seen in line c. Here, the haku clause
codes the hypothetical situation of there being supernatural power in the old
man’s blood. The main clause of this adverbial construction is in line e. It
denotes the situation that is supposed to occur, i.e. that the old man should
quickly hand the child back to its mother, if the hypothetical situation stated
in the haku clause applies. The main clause in line e. has both the modal verb
uniyiw 'to be necessary, to have to, should' and the future tense morpheme
sa2-. Both of these morphemes are irrealis operators which underscore the
conditional meaning of that adverbial clause construction.
       Finally, a counterfactual conditional clause occurs in line f., ‘if she had
not let the old man hold the child‘. I analyze it as a counterfactual clause
according to the factors mentioned earlier. First, the adverbial clause assumes
a firm (not-pending) truth-value; its meaning assumes that the mother did
indeed let the old man hold the baby. Also importantly, the adverbial clause
has a negative truth-value, in that it posits a hypothetical scenario that did not
happen. Another criterion that identifies this as a counterfactual conditional
is that it has the past tense marker -wa&. According to Givén 1990, this is one
of the realis operators typically found in a counterfactual clause. Finally, the
main clause in line g. has an irrealis operator, the verb s-apa¢kaw8 ‘it is
fast and unforeseen; it happens quick and unexpectedly'. This verb makes
reference to the fact that a future event, a necessarily unplanned for event,
will happen.","[44, 45, 46]"

7.0 Introduction
         There are 23 tokens of adverbial clauses that have the conjunction
haku 'if; whether’. This conjunction has also been found to occur with two
other adverbial conjunctions as the second member in a complex conjunction:
the manner conjunction kaheé 'like, as if' and the concessive conjunction
?iyeme 'though, although; even if'. Ineseho Chumash also has the haku
conjunction with the meaning 'if'. This conjunction is probably related to the
general connective *ha, which still occurred in Ineseno but not in Barbareho
during the time of Harrington’s field work, and the adverbial conjunction ku
 ""lest; so that..not...'. One word known to be based partly upon the haku
 ‘if’ conjunction is kKehaku 'or', derived from the conjunction ke 'and' and
haku 'if'.
         Adverbial clauses of the haku ‘if' type appear in initial and final
positions: 15 are preposed, 8 are postposed. These adverbial clauses either
code a conditional relation with a main clause or a relation that is semantically
neutral with respect to conditionality or time.7.1 haku ‘if’ clauses that code conditional relations
       In a conditional relation, the event or state named by the adverbial
clause provides the condition(s) under which the event or state named by the
main   clause   can occur.   In such relations, the adverbial   clause   denotes   a
hypothetical or unreal situation, and the main clause will typically have certain
lexical items and morphosyntax that further point to the irrealis nature of the
conditional relation (Givén 1990). For example, in Barbareno Chumash the
main clause may have a modal verb such as uniyiw 'to be necessary, to have
to, should' or alaqway 'can, be able, be possible', the future tense prefix
sa2-, the modal particle may 'would; should; might', the hortative particle
kume   'let it not be (that)...', a marker of certainty such as the particle pa
 ‘must be, must have, probably, likely' or kalpas ‘surely, certainly', the
particle kimini 'then (in that case)', an imperative verb, an indirect
request, or a main clause verb that is itself a question (Givén 1990). Some
examples of these features in haku 'if' conditional clause constructions will
be illustrated throughout this section.","[197, 198]"
"        In (4) above, the hortative particle kume occurs in a clause that
expresses the possibility of an undesirable outcome. The clause serves to
express a wish or desire on the part of a narrative-internal participant. ku
adverbial clauses, on the other hand, serve to express the purpose of what a
participant does in a preceding main clause. As we have seen, the purpose is

kalpas ‘certainly; of course', among others. These are illustated in (5) and
(6). Example (5) actually has two na conditional clauses. The first na clause
appears in line a. Itsmain clause (lineb.) marks the irrealis nature of the
event with the future tense prefix sa?-. The na clause in line d. has a main
clause (line e.) with two irrealis operators: the particle 2inu? 'surely' and
the future tense prefix sa2-.","[212, 213]"

concessive meaning seems equally plausible. There are doubtless many shades
of concessive and concessive-conditional meaning that a Barbareno Chumash
speaker could have expressed by varying the possible combinations of
conjunctions and affixes in an 2iyeme clause. Indeed, a subtle array of
meanings would be expected given the differences in level of expectation
coded by the haku 'if' and na ‘if; when' adverbial conjunctions. The 11
tokens of 2iyeme clauses in my analyzed Barbareho Chumash corpus can
give only a glimpse of what choices speakers had available to them.",[259]

English, only 6% (3 out of 53 purpose clauses) were preposed; in her written
corpus (of 1009 tokens), only 18% of the purpose clauses were preposed.
Thompson (pp. 81,82) argues that the reason for the disparity in frequency
between initial and final purpose clauses has to do with the organizing
function that initial purpose clauses have. The basic, unmarked function of a
purpose clause is local in nature; it functions to name the purpose for which
the action in the main clause is performed. The discourse-organizing role that
initial purpose clauses perform goes way beyond this basic function. Thompson
argues that, normally, in face-to-face interaction, the speaker has other means
by which to guide the addressee’s attention. These include gestures, eye
movement, intonation, and amplitude, among other things.",[436]

     clauses with respect to level of expectation and likelihood
        As has been pointed out by Thompson & Longacre (1985:193), Givén
(1990:830, 832-833), and Comrie (1986), many languages code distinctions in
conditional and time clauses, distinctions that have to do with the speaker’s
level of expectation about the possibility or hypotheticality of the event in
question. For example, Thompson and Longacre (1985:193) state that the
difference between the English sentences 'If he comes, you will see him' and
                                              205
 ""When he comes, you will see him' is that the latter, 'when he comes"",
codes a higher level of likelihood or expectation that the event 'he comes'
will occur. Thus with the English conjunction 'when', the speaker has a
higher expectation that he will come; with ‘if’, the speaker     Fe
                                                                    has
                                                                    hia
                                                                        a lowei

expectation that he will come.
         Like English and many other languages, Barbareno Chumash codes the
speaker’s level of expectation via the choice of an adverbial conjunction. This
is particularly clear for three of the adverbial conjunctions: mali 'when', na
 ‘if; when' and haku ‘if; whether'. The schematic in Figure 3 shows where
these conjunctions stand, relative to each other, on a scale of expectation,
likelihood, and hypotheticality.              haku    ‘if!          na   ‘if; when'       mali     ‘when!","[227, 228]"

between the conjunction and the rest of its clause, then the clause will have
a pronoun even though it would not have had the pronoun if there had not
been any intervening material. We have seen this kind of pattern not only for
relative clauses and other nominalized
                                  Sime clauses
                                       SA      (see

discontinuous adverbial clauses. (See the Gukanu 'so that, in order to'

line c., the verb might have had the form *2al-tani-2?-ali-2?-aqsmul

11.1 Pronominal subject marking in Gu clauses
        Thompson and Longacre (1985) note that many languages code
purpose clauses differently depending upon whether the subject of the
purpose clause is the same as or different than the subject of the main clause.
For example, in English and many other languages, same-subject purpose
clauses often have an infinitive or otherwise reduced form of the verb. Thus
in the sentence 'we went to the zoo to see the animais', the purpose clause
 ‘to see the animals' has an infinitive verb 'to see'. Barbareho éu clauses
do not have such distinct syntax, however. A Gu clause with the same subject
as the main clause does not have any special morphology or reduced marking
related to the fact that it is a same-subject clause, nor is there necessarily any
particular morphology or form of the verb when the main clause and éu
clause have different subjects.
        For example, as we saw in (1) above, the subject of the main clause
verb 'stay a while' is not the subject of the Gu clause verb 'cure someone'.
Both subjects are in third person singular, however, and both subjects are
indexed on the respective verbs with the third person prefix s-. There is no
morphology on either verb that indicates a different subject. In (2), the main
clause subject and the Gu adverbial clause subject are the same. The subject,                                            241
a sorcerer named Saximumasét, is indexed with the third person prefix s-,
both on the main clause verb as well as on the Gu clause verb. The main
clause appears in line c., and the Gu clause is in line d. The Gu clause verb
has no special tense, aspect, or moda! morphology, nor any reduction in
morphosyntax, that results from it being a same-subject clause.","[262, 263, 264]"
"3. It is worth noting again that it is not unusual in Barbareho grammar for a
verbal modifier such as liya ‘all' to be treated as the head element, having
tense and aspectual morphemes affixed to it. The reason why the word liya
 ‘all' in (7) line h. is not so inflected (i.e., the reason why it is not
*samsa?liya hisamsuku instead of the attested liya samsa?suku) is
that, in that particular token, the word liya is a fronted NP that has the
meaning ‘everyone; all'. It is not a verbal modifier. If liya were a verbal
modifier in (7) line h., it would have the meaning 'so that they would respect
him in every way' or ‘so that they would respect him all around’. This
meaning would be kind of odd, and it is not at all the meaning implied by
Harrington’s translation, 'so that all will respect him as a person’.",[311]

2.3.6Relative clause constructions
      Relative clauses are syntactically-dependent clauses that modify a head
noun (head NP). In the sentence they finally caught the man who robbed the
bank, the head NP is the man and the relative clause is whe robbed the bank.
This relative clause is postnominal; it follows its head NP the man. The
relativizer is who; it links the relative clause to its head NP. The head NP has
the grammatical role of object in its main clause: it is the object of the verb
'caught'. The NPrel, or relative-clause co-referent of the head NP, has the
grammatical role of subject: it is the subject of the verb 'robbed'.
         Relative clauses in Barbareho Chumash have the following features.
First, all relative clauses are postnominal. Second, they are linked to the head
noun via the dependent proclitic hi=. Exceptions are rare. Third, all of the
grammatical role positions available in Barbareho can be relativized. Thus
subjects, objects, and obliques--including possessors--can be relativized. Finally,
the grammar of relativization is sensitive to the distinction between core
argument NPrels and oblique NPrels. With rare exception, core-argument
NPrels, i.e. subjects and objects, always occur in nominalized relative clauses.
Only about 60% of the relative clauses with oblique NPrels, however, are
nominalized..
       Below are two sets of near-minimal] pairs that show some differences
between a basic clause and a relative clause construction in Barbareho
Chumash. In (320)b the relative clause is a Subject-relative, because the NPrel
of the head NP ‘ash tree' has the grammatical role of subject in the relative
clause 'that stood near the door of his house '. The third person pronoun s-
is not retained   in the relative clause. As we     saw    in 2.3.3.1,   however,   in
Barbareho Chumash it is normal for nominalized clauses, including relative
clauses, not to retain the third person subject pronoun.(320)

  co-referent of 'rocks' has the grammatical role of object in the relative clause
   ‘that they can throw at one another'. Note that the third person plural object
  -wun is not suffixed to the relative clause verb in (321)b, but neither is it
  suffixed to the main clause verb in (321) a. More study needs to be done on
  where, when and why the plural object suffix -wun appears. This suffix most
_ often appears when the referents are human or otherwise animate, but it can
  also appear when the referents in question are neither human nor animate.  (321)

         Like the relative clause in (321), the relative clause in (322) is an
Object-relative. Structurally they are very different, however. Example (322)
illustrates the only relative-clause token in the analyzed corpus that has a
relativizer in the form of ka=. Like the contrastive focus marker and stative
proclitic of the same form, the relativizer ka= is a reflex of the proto-
Chumash demonstrative *ka. The relative clause construction has a similar
form to the cleft construction illustrated earlier in (284), with the important
exception that the relative clause is not nominalized.","[115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"

position (Thompson 1985: 73,74). The same is true for Barbareho Chumash.
A non-literal purpose clause is one that does not, literally, name the purpose
of a main      clause   action.   Thompson      notes   that   sometimes,   in fact,   the
associated main clause does not name any action at all. Other times the non-
literal purpose clauses are speech acts, which serve to modify assertions the
speaker or writer makes rather than the actual material itself. Examples from
English include the following,(5) 'To set our course, there was only one golden rule.' (Severin 1978:183 in
    Thompson 1985:73)(6) 'To make gravy from pan drippings, see p. 333.' (Rombauer and Becker
    1962:400 in Thompson 1985:74)(7) 'To sum up, then, English has a very definite and complex grammar with
    some variation..."" (Quirk et al. 1972:113,04 and Golkova 1968:123 in
     Thompson 1985:74)As Thompson notes, one cannot literally make gravy drippings by looking at
a written page, as in (6), nor is it the intent of Quirk et al. in (7) to state that
English has a ‘very definite and complex grammar’ that serves the purpose
of making summations. Rather, these purpose clauses respond to the implicit
needs and expectations of the readers. The initial, non-literal purpose clause
in line b. of the Barbareho Chumash example below functions in a similar
vein.","[431, 432]"

10.0 Introduction
        Adverbial clauses with the conjunction 2iyeme ‘though, although;
even if‘ are another adverbial clause type in my corpus. There are only 11
tokens of this type: 3 are preposed, 7 are postposed, and 1 occurs in medial
position.
        The 2?iyeme conjunction appears to be derived from a particle * 2iye
(meaning uncertain) and the emphatic clitic he ‘just, merely’. The particle
* 2iye appears to be cognate with Ineseho 2iya        'and; even', which is found
in the Ineseho adverbial conjunction 2iyapa ‘even if; even though'
(Applegate 1972a). Also, the 2iye- in ?iyemhe is doubtless the same
morpheme as the 2?iye- in the Barbareho conjunction 2iyena '(even) if',
discussed briefly in chapter 8. Adverbial clauses with 2 iyeme code concessive
relations and concessive conditional relations. These relations are discussed in
turn in sections 10.1 and 10.2. One of the ?iyeme clause tokens is
discontinuous--a situation whereby the adverbial conjunction is separated from
the rest of its clause by an intervening noun phrase or another adverbial
clause. This one token is discussed in 10.3. A summary is given in 10.4.10.1 2iyewe    clauses that code concessive relations
       All of the   2iyeme    adverbial   clauses   have   been   found   to code   a
concessive relation with a main clause, though a subset of these also code a
concessive conditional relation. As Givdén states (1990:835), a concessive
relation involves        '...a presupposed contrast or counter-expectancy, with the ADV-clause
       supplying the grounds for the counter-expectation, and the main clause
       supplying the less-likely event or state'.","[253, 254]"
"11.2 Tense, aspect and modality in Gu clauses
        Tense and aspect morphology is rare in Gu adverbial clauses. None of
these clauses show any past tense marking, such as would be seen with the
past tense suffix -was or the habitual prefix qili- ‘used to'. Only 5 of the
53 tokens show any tense marking at all. Each of these 5 tokens has the future
tense prefix sa?-. These tokens tend to have a main clause that depicts an
unrealized event. One reason the main clause event is unrealized is that it
never happened or just does not ever happen. In such main clauses negation
appears on the verb, signalled with the prefix e-, and the Gu clause has the
future tense prefix sa?-. An illustration is given in (18). The negated main
clause appears in line c.; its corresponding Gu clause follows it in line d. This
pair of clauses contrasts thematically with the non-negated main clause in line
a. and its corresponding Gu clause in line b. In the passage below, Mary Yee
talks about customary and non-customary uses for the hallucinogenic datura
plant. The first two clauses denote what the norm was, the second pair of
clauses denote what the norm was not.",[274]

                             Introduction to Part IE
        Barbareno Chumash is a language with a rich variety of adverbial
clause constructions. In this part of the dissertation I discuss and illustrate the
subtleties and complexities one finds in the syntax, morphology and semantics
of this domain of Barbareho grammar.
        Barbareho adverbial clauses code a variety of semantic relations with
main clauses, including temporal, conditional, concessive, purposive, reason,
and manner relations. Some adverbial clause types code only one of these
relations, whereas others code several of them. Some of the adverbial clause
types, however, have tokens that are semantically neutral with respect to
conditionality and time.
        As we explore the ways in which these adverbial clause types code
semantic relations, we will come upon interesting issues and striking
grammatical patterns. Some of these are discussed and predicted in the
typological literature on adverbial clauses, in particular Thompson and
Longacre 1985 and Givén 1990. For example, it is known that adverbial
conjunctions that are semantically unspecific, like English 'when', generally
need to be accompanied by specific tense and aspectual morphology, and/or
lexical temporal indicators, in order to code specific kinds of temporal
relations unambiguously. We see further confirmation of this generalization in
such Barbareho adverbial clause types as mali ‘when' in chapter 6, na if;
when' in chapter 8, and wa ‘if; when' in chapter 9. These adverbial clause
types code temporal relations as well as other kinds of relations.
        One often finds conditional relations to be indicated and underscored
by the modal morphology of a language. We will see that this is also the case
for conditional relations coded by Barbareno adverbial clauses, specifically
haku   'if' clauses in chapter 7,na     ‘if; when'   clauses in chapter 8, and wa
 ‘if; when' clauses in chapter 9.
         Distinctive patterns of pronominal subject marking are well known and
expected in purposive relations. In English, for example, subject marking can
be suppressed in same-subject purpose clauses. In chapter 12, we will see in
the Gukanu clause type, which codes only purposive relations, that subject
marking may be suppressed in either same-subject or different-subject purpose
clauses. We will see that the semantics of agency and control is the motivating
factor that affects pronominal suppression in this adverbial clause type. In
other Barbareho adverbial clause types, however, just the fact that the                                       116
adverbial clause has the same subject as the main clause is enough to create
a semantic bond that is tight enough to allow such pronominal suppression.
We will see this pattern in simultaneous temporal relations coded by
 2akimpi ? ‘during; while' clauses in chapter 5, reason relations coded by
kayké       'because' clauses in chapter 14, and finally in manner relations
coded by kaneé        'like; as if‘ clauses in chapter 16. Pronominal subject
suppression is attested only for third person subjects--first and second person
subject pronouns are always retained in the adverbial clause.
         Sometimes mentioned in the crosslinguistic literature is the fact that an
adverbial conjunction may code the speaker’s or narrator’s expectations with
regard to the likelihood that a given event will occur. For example in English,
the conjunction 'when' connotes a greater expectation or likelihood than the
conjunction ‘if'. In the grammar of Barbareho Chumash adverbial clauses,
this is an important and complex category. Several adverbial conjunctions play
a role in coding the speaker’s point of view with regard to when and whether
an event can occur, will occur, or could have already occurred: mali                   ‘if;
when' clauses (chapter 6), haku 'if' clauses (chapter 7), na ‘if; when'
clauses (chapter 8), and wa _ ‘if; when' clauses (chapter 9). See also the
2akay hu ‘until' clauses in chapter 4 and 2iyeme ‘though; although'
clauses in chapter 10.
        Barbareno Chumash has two adverbial clause types that code
distinctions in reason relations. The Kayké 'because' clauses (chapter 14)
tend to provide motivations for acts performed through talk such as
commands and claims, and reasons for conclusions that are inferred. The
ihehu ""because, since, from' clauses (chapter 15) code causal relations in
which   one    event   causes     another      event   to   occur.   Also,   mehu   clause
constructions always depict unintentional acts or results. The differences in the
reason relations coded by these two clause types reflect distinctions between
internal and external motivations (Halliday and Hasan 1976, Givén 1990:834-
835), distinctions among action-based, knowledged-based and fact-based causal
relations (Schiffrin 1987), and distinctions among fourth-, third- and second-
order types of causal relations in the Entity Type Hierarchy (Hengeveld 1998),
in that mehu     clauses   code    external,    fact-based,    and   second-order   causal
relations.
        There is an array of adverbial clause types that one can identify based
upon specific adverbial conjunctions. Thirteen such clause types are analyzed,
discussed and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16. These comprise almost all
of the adverbial clause types that have conjunctions in this language. There
may be other kinds of Barbareho adverbial clause types that have                                            117
conjunctions, but some possible adverbial clause types were not included
because they could not be clearly identified as adverbial clauses. Also, a
possible adverbial clause type was omitted if there were not enough data or
context that would allow a substantive-enough discussionand illustration for
that particular adverbial clause type. Still, the adverbial clause types discussed
and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16 range from the very rare ku ‘lest, so
that...not' adverbial clause type, which only has two tokens, to the numerous
na ‘if; when; in order to' adverbial clause type, which has nearly 200 tokens.
         Part II has the following chapters, named for the adverbial conjunction
that identifies the adverbial clause type in question:       Chapter 3      Adverbial clauses without conjunctions

       Chapter 16     kaheé      'like, as, as if' clauses        Chapters 4 - 16 follow a general format. First is a brief discussion of
the adverbial conjunction, including its history and any cognates it is known to
have. Next is an overall view of the number of tokens the adverbial clause
type has, what kinds of semantic relations it codes, and what positions
(preposed or postposed) it may take. The body of each chapter then illustrates
each relevant semantic relation and the ways in which it is coded in that clause
type. Special attention is given to those issues and patterns that stand out, e.g.
unusual or prominent patterns in person marking, tense/aspect/modality, ways
in which the speaker’s point of view is coded, etc.
        The focus of part II of the dissertation is upon 13 adverbial clause
types that have adverbial conjunctions. A much smaller subset of Barbareho
adverbial clauses lack adverbial conjunctions. They are discussed in chapter
3, to which we now turn.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140]"
