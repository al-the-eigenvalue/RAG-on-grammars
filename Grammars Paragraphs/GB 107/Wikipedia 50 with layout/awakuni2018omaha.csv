How to Construct an Omaha Sentence
The English method relies on permutations of
classes of concept words and is extremely com-
plicated. The Omaha method is to use a spe-
cial word for each type of demand and is quite
simple.
   Note that in Omaha, verbs always come after
their nouns, whether these are subject or object.
This is entirely different than in English, where
object nouns normally come after their verb.
Thus in English [The cat (subject noun)] [caught
(transitive verb)] [the mouse (object noun)], but
in Omaha [The cat (subject noun)] [the mouse
(object noun)] [caught (transitive verb)].

  E. The instructor has each student come
     forward and write a word on the board,         • When the plain form of a verb ends in -­e,
     using the verb bax̣ ú. Example:                  this -­e will change to -­a in a command.
        Wagōⁿze: Stan, gí ga ho!                    • This change from -­e to -­a is called
        Stan: Ho! [Comes forward.]                    ablaut (pronounced ahp-­lout). Ablaut
                                                      occurs before several types of particles,

                                                      including command particles.
        Stan: Ho! [Writes the word “moⁿthíⁿ.”]
                                                    • When a woman is giving a command
                                                      using a verb that normally ends in -­e,
                                                      there is no separate command particle.
                                                      The command is signaled by the ablaut

Locative u-­: “path”                                                         • In contrast to the “environment” sense,

     the general environment.
                                                           uˀé: plow, make holes for planting
                                                           ubáhe: edge, margin, border
Nominalizing wa-­with Locative u-­                         ubáhiⁿ: insert, poke, get in where you
                                                             shouldn’t

                                                           ubátʰe: sew a piece on to lengthen cloth;
   • Locative u-­words can be either nouns                   exaggerate
     or verbs. When they are verbs, they                   ubétʰoⁿ: wrap, as with a blanket or towel
     can be turned into nouns by adding a
                                                           ubíhe: line of gravel left by a grader
     nominalizing wa-­in front of them, just
     as with many other verbs.                             ubísoⁿde: crowded, people pressed
                                                             together
   • When wa-­is added to a locative u-­verb, it
     shows itself by pulling the accent forward            učʰízhe: weedy, thicket, brush, forest with
     onto the u-­and making it canonically long.             lots of little trees   • The reason for this is historical. The                udá: icebound
     Omaha /u/ sound was originally                        ugádoⁿ: pound in,
     pronounced /o/, as in most other Siouan                 as a nail
     languages. So locative u-­was originally              ugákkiba: split
     locative o-­. A locative o-­verb o-­háⁿ               ugánoⁿppaze: dark,
     could be turned into a noun by adding                   pitch black,
     nominalizing wa-­, wa-­ó-­haⁿ, which would              as from a blackout
     pull the accent forward to the second
                                                           ugásˀiⁿ: peek in
     syllable, o-­. But the a and the o were hard
     to distinguish, so they blurred together              ugáṣni: cool down,
     into one long vowel ō, making the word                  as in the evening           Fig. 192. učʰízhe: thicket     wō-­haⁿ. Then Omaha and Ponca raised                  ugáṣnoⁿ: lasso, throw a
     the vowel /o/ to /u/. This theoretically                loop over something
     made the word wū-­haⁿ. But /w/ is a semi-­            ugáspe: depression, indentation,
     vowel that is used as a consonant, but is               as on a bed where you sat
     really pronounced about the same way as
                                                           ugáshke: tie, as a horse
     the vowel /u/, and can’t be distinguished
                                                           ugáshoⁿ: travel, journey
     from it here. So the w merged with the u,
     and the resulting noun ends up as ūhaⁿ.               ugáttoⁿthe: tumble, roll over
   • Any time a locative u-­word has the accent            ugíppi: full, as a cup of water
     on the first syllable as ū-­, it means that there     ugóⁿba: getting light out, dawn
     are actually two elements there, wa-­+ u-­.

   students with a base word, and the            Locative u-­ Verbs
   students respond with a corresponding
   u-­word. While doing so, they should use
   the gesture of thrusting the right hand
   forward as they grasp the right wrist
   with the left hand. Example:
      Wagōⁿze: Batʰé. (“Sew it.”)
      Ttáppuskazhiⁿga: Ubátʰe.
        (“Exaggerate.”) [left hand grabs right
        wrist]
      Wagōⁿze: Ṣní. (“Cold.”)
      Ttáppuskazhiⁿga: Uṣní. (“Cold out.”)

D. The instructor says something to
   each student that can be answered with          • Locative u-­verbs generally conjugate
   an u-­or ū-­word. The student responds            by simply adding u-­to the conjugated
   appropriately. Example:                           verb stem that follows it, as u-­[affixed

   asking each other questions that can be           like oⁿwóⁿ-­, which is how this sequence is

                                                     because the u-­prefix automatically

9.2 First Catch, First Fruits                             For Umóⁿhoⁿ people the process of asking for
                                                      help takes several cultural values into account.
A growing child learns many core values by
observing adult behavior. Many adults will pres-
ent their “first catch fish,” “first hunt meat,” or
“first harvest fruits” to someone else. The recip-
ient may be an Elder or a person in poor health.
This practice models to younger community
members the importance of being generous—­
not stingy.
    Such acts of food sharing are highly prized.
The person receiving the gift of food serves as a
witness to the generosity of the giver. By receiv-
ing the gift he or she acknowledges the giver’s
skills at food acquisition. This also reinforces
the feeling that the giver has received proper
upbringing by the giver’s family and clan.
    This practice sometimes extends to non-­
food items. When people master the skills to
make or craft something, such as tying a shawl
or making a piece of beadwork, they will often        Fig. 7. (top left) Grandfather and Grandson Fishing by

The Two Active Subject Positionals                     modern speakers to indicate that the
                                                       subject is plural. However, either amá
                                                       or akʰá can refer to a plural subject. If
                                                       we use akʰá, we mean a clearly defined,

        distributive plurality, by which we mean

        stories using the bi ama demand

   students with an appropriate base word
   or another instrumental prefix verb that
   is built on the same base as one of the
   mū-­verbs. The students respond with the
   corresponding “shooting” instrumental
   prefix verb. While doing so, they should
   use a gesture for “shooting” by jabbing
   the index finger of the right hand into the
   palm of the left hand. Example:
     Wagōⁿze: Hôⁿ. (“Night.”)
     Ttáppuskazhiⁿga: Mūhoⁿ. (“Shoot till
       dark.”) [with a “shooting” gesture]
     Wagōⁿze: Bihíthe. (“Blow away.”)
     Ttáppuskazhiⁿga: Mūhithe. (“Blow
       away.”) [with the “shooting” gesture]
D. The instructor asks each student a
   question that can be answered with a
   “cutting” word. The student responds
   appropriately, using a mū-­instrumental
   prefix verb. Example:
     Wagōⁿze: Rory akʰa águdi a? (“Where’s
      Rory?”)
     Barbara: Rory akʰa mūgthoⁿ athá.
       (“Rory wandered off.”)
     Wagōⁿze: Ttáx̌ ti thiⁿ thakkíde a? (“Did
      you shoot at the deer?”)
     Dan: Áoⁿ, akkíde éde, mūaṣhnoⁿ. (“Yes,
      I shot at it, but I missed.”)
E. The students form small groups
   of about two or three and take turns
   asking each other questions that can
   be answered using a mū-­or other
   instrumental prefix verb. Using the
   corresponding gestures with them is
   encouraged.

 E. The students form small groups
    of about two or three and take turns
    asking each other questions that can
    be answered using a thi-­instrumental
    prefix verb. The one asking gets to set
    the scene, but the one answering gets to
    choose who did it.
                                                    • As with thi-­verbs, many of the base
                                                      words with the instrumental prefix tha-­
17.2 tha-­ “by mouth ”                                do not seem to exist independently.
                                                      However, many of these base words are
                                                      shared between the two instrumental
                                                      prefixes, and that allows us to triangulate
                                                      in on their meaning, just as we can for
                                                      many Latin or Greek roots in English.
                                                      Consider:
  • Another very old instrumental prefix is
    tha-­, which suggests that the action is
    implemented by means of someone’s
    mouth. This covers activities like eating,
    drinking, biting, and speaking.
  • As with thi-­verbs, tha-­instrumental
    prefix verbs are normally active and
    frequently transitive. Someone uses
    the mouth to produce the condition              • Comparing these two sets allows us

  • All tha-­instrumental prefix verbs
                                                      independently. We now know that ˀa

                                                    actions done by foot. But the second set,
                                                    of actions directed against a surface, are
                                                    often stative. Some of these can be either
                                                    active or stative depending on context,
                                                    since the same word that describes the
                                                    action can also describe the result of that
                                                    action. Thus, noⁿttūbe can refer either to
                                                    the action of grinding corn or to the state
                                                    of the corn being ground into meal.

Pronoun CombinationsWe now have two series of affixed pronouns:
an agent series for “I,” “you,” and “we”; and a
patient series for “me,” “you,” “us,” and “them

how to combine them, so that we can say “I do
it to you,” “you did it to me,” “we did it to them,”
and so forth.

                                                     in which they are made. In English, we
                                                     distinguish two series: the voiced stops b,
                                                     d and g; and the voiceless stops p, t and k.
                                                     The voiceless stops are usually aspirated,
                                                     which means that a puff of air comes out

                                                     aspirated when they are preceded by s.
                                                     The voiced stops are never aspirated.
                                                   • In Omaha, we distinguish several series
                                                     of stops. First is the simple series p, t
                                                     and k. These occur only when they are

  E. The students of the younger
     generation pull their chairs out a bit from

     them to look at their aunt or uncle and
     surmises that they are hungry. The child
     asks if the uncle or aunt is hungry, and
     the uncle or aunt says yes and tells what
     kind of food is favored. The niece or
     nephew promises to get it or cook it, and
     the uncle or aunt says to hurry. The child

                                                         there, because it draws the accent forward

  • A detransitivizing wa-­verb should have

    wabthátʰe, “I eat.”

                                                        nouns normally require a positional first,
                                                        which we discuss in section 15.2.

                                                        the house.” Nouns that end in -­e replace

     come before a noun to use the noun as
     a point of reference for something else.
     Postpositions are the same thing, except       Vocabulary: Nouns
     that they come after the noun instead of
                                                      gāx̌a: tree branch

   • While English has many prepositions,
     Omaha has only three common                      móⁿx̣ e: sky
     postpositions. These postpositions are:          ttí: house
     -­di, meaning at, on or in the location;         ttóⁿde: the ground
     -­tta, meaning to, toward, or in the
     direction of the location; and -­tʰoⁿ,
     meaning from the location.
   • -­tʰoⁿ, “from,” is often appended after one
     of the other two. This seems to have been
     normal in nineteenth-­century Omaha,
     but our modern speakers have indicated
     that it is fine to use it alone.
   • Postpositions may be appended directly
     to the generic third person emphatic
     pronoun e: edí, “right there, at that spot”;
     ettá, “toward that place”; edítʰoⁿ or            Fig. 130. móⁿx̣ e: sky
