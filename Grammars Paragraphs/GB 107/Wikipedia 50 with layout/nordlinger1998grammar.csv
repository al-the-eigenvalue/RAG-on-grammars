7.5 QUESTIONS
7.5.1 YES/NO QUESTIONS
   Yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence,
but are said with a rising, questioning intonation:
  (7-137) Gajbi murnd-u          yana         manganyma?
          eat   IDU.INC.A-FUT this.IV.SG.ACC tucker.Ili(ACC)
          Can we eat some of this food?
   (7-138) Yagu ny-a         nagatna            ngayijinya ngangirna?
           leave 2SG.A-PST that.one.1I.SG.ACC FM.II(ACC) 2SG.POSS.II(ACC)
           Did you drop your grandmother off (at the hospital)?
   (7-139) Yana                ngarrga?
             this.IV.SG:NOM ISG.POSS.IV(NOM)
             Is this mine?
  Hale's corpus contains examples in which an interrogative particle gayi is used in such
polar yes/no questions. Note that this particle appears in the auxiliary in examples (7-140)
and (7-141), and alone in second position in the verbless clause (7-142):18
   (7-140) Duditiarri gayi-ny-u     iniyawulu?
           spear      INT-2SG.A-FUT that.I.DU.ACC
             What, you are spearing them (du)? (Hale 1959:13)
18 In the following examples I have used the orthography and glossing conventions of this work, hut have
     retained Hale's translations.
198     Chapter 7   (7-141) Balijî  gayi-nyi?
           hungry INT-2SG.S(PR)
           Are you hungry? (Hale 1959:19)
   (7-142) Gudayi-barli                gayi inîya                 janji?
              bite-AGNT.I(NOM) INT that.I.SG.NOM dog.I(NOM)
              Is that dog cheeky? (Hale 1959:29)
   This interrogative particle is not present in my corpus and, since the dialect that Hale
recorded appears to be closer to Gudanji than Wambaya,19 it is possible that the interrogative
particle gayi is present only in Gudanji. However, there is a negative interrogative particle in '
Wambaya present in both my corpus and Hale's notes, and also reported by Chadwick
(1978:99). The form of this particle is wayi and, like the negative particle guyala, it requires
the presence of irrealis marking in the auxiliary. There is some variability as to how sentences
containing this particle are translated into English: either as negative yes/no questions
(examples (7-143), (7-144)); information questions meaning `why not' (7-143); or as simple
positive yes/no questions ((7-145), (7-146)):
   (7-143) Wayî           ny-uda                îlînga?
              NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PST hear
              Aren't you listening?/Why aren't you listening?
   (7-144) Wayi           ny-uda                yabu balanucrru?
              NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PST have                 spear.IV(ACC)
              Don't you have a spear? (Hale 1959:31)
   (7-145) Wayî           ny-udi              ngarlwî Wambaya?
              NEG.INT 2SG.S-NACT.PR talk
              Can you talk Wambaya? (Hale 1959:31)
   (7-146) (W)ayî ny-udî               yabu guyiga?
              NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PR    have fire.IV(ACC)
              Have you got firewood? (Chadwick 1978:99)
   I suspect that the basic use of wayî is in yes/no questions when the speaker is anticipating
a negative reply, and that examples such as (7-145) and (7-146) could probably have been
explained in this way in the contexts in which they were given. The information question
associated with (7-143) could arise for pragmatic reasons: if the speaker asks the question
Aren't you listening? then it might be expected that he/she is also looking for an explanation
why. However, further research is required in order to test this hypothesis and more
accurately determine the meaning of this particle and the contexts of its use.","[215, 216]"

7.6 NEGATION
7.6.1 SENTENTL&L NEGATION
7.6.1.1 NEGATION OF INDICATIVE CLAUSES
   There are two alternative constructions available for negating an indicative clause, each
containing a different negative particle (glossed NEG). Although speakers claim that the two
constructions have the same meaning, the distribution of each construction in the corpus
suggests that there is in fact a difference in usage between the two I will discuss this
difference below, but first I will explain and exemplify the structural characteristics of the
constructions.
200    Chapter 7   The constructions are primarily distinguished by the form of the negative particle —
yangula or guyala — which appears in initial position in the clause.20 Guyala is also used
alone to mean `no, nothing'; yangula is never used in this function. There is one other respect
in which the two constructions differ: while both particles (usually) require the presence of
the hypothetical suffix in the auxiliary in future clauses, only guyala has the further
requirement that the auxiliary contain an irrealis mood suffix in past and present tense
clauses. In past and present tense clauses with yangula the auxiliary has the same form that it
would in the corresponding positive sentence. Examples include the following. Note that in
future tense negative clauses the verb does not inflect for future tense (see §6.1.2):
   (7-155) Guyala ng-uda                     gajbî manganyma.
             NEG        ISG.A-NACT.PST eat            tucker.Ill(ACC)
             I couldn't eat any dinner.
   (7-156) Guyala ngurr-uji                      ngajbi irra.
             NEG        1PL.INC.A-NACT.PR see               3PL.ACC
             We never see them.
   (7-157) Yangula îrri-ng-a       jiyawu.
           NEG      3PL.A-l 0-NF give
           They didn't give me (my country).
   (7-158) Yangula îrri-n                      nananga guri-guriny-mi.
              NEG         3PL.A(NP)-PROG care.for           RDP-good-FAC
             They're not looking after her properly.
   (7-159) Yangula gurl-agba ganmami.
           NEG       2DU.S-HYP get.close
           You can't get close.
   (7-160) Guyala ng-agba yandu bungmanya-nka.
              NEG        ISG.S-HYP wait old.woman.II-DAT
              I'm not going to wait for the old woman.
   (7-161) Yangula nga-ngg-agba duga-jirrimi.
              NEG         1 SG.A-RR-HYP sit.down-CAUS
              I'm not going to sit (myself) down.
   It seems that when a negative indicative clause has immediate future tense, the auxiliary
does not contain the hypothetical suffix. In this case yangula clauses usually have simple
future tense marking (example (7-162)) and guyala clauses often have present tense irrealis
marking (7-163).
   (7-162) Yangula ngu-ny-u                   daguma.
              NEG         1 SG.A-20-FUT       hit
              I'm not going to hit you.
   (7-163) Guyala ng-udi                   gamanula gunyanga-nmanji.
              NEG         1 SG.A-NACT.PR. send       other.Il-ALL
              I won't send her to another (girl).","[217, 218]"
"
7.6.1.2 NEGATION OF IMPERATIVE CLAUSES
   Imperative clauses are negated with the use of the negative imperative particle alyu
(glossed `NEG.IMP') which must always be initial in the clause.25 In negative imperative
clauses the auxiliary (when present) appears in the non-future tense form and the verb can24 It is interesting that, given this semantic difference, it is guyala rather than yangula that is used as an
    interjection with the meaning 'no, nothing'. This may be due to politeness: in the face of a request. it is
    more polite to suggest that the reason for saying 'no' is beyond one's control than to simply refuse (e.g.
    I can 't versus I won't).
25 The Gudanji negative imperative particle is durdami. Note that, unlike in Wambaya (see §5.5).
    imperative clauses in Gudanji always have an auxiliary even when singular. Thus in a typical singular
    negative imperative clause, durdami is followed by the auxiliary nya.
       Durdami nya        nijbi!
       NEG.IMP SG.IMP       sing
       Don't sing!
      This is equivalent to the Wambaya Alyu nijbi!
                                                                    Syntax of simple sentences   203appear either with or without future tense marking. For a discussion of auxiliaries and verbs
in imperative clauses see §5.5 and §6.1.2 respectively. Some positive and negative pairs are:
  (7-175) a. Daguma j-ba nyî-ng(-a)!
             hit-TH-FUT  2SG.A-10(-NF)
             Hit me!
            b. Alyu       nyi-ng-a dagurnaldaguma j-ba!
               NEG.BIP 2SG.A-10-NF hit/hit-TH-FUT
               Don't hit me!
  (7-176) a. Ngara-ba ini            galyurringi!
             drink-FUT this.I.SG.ACC water.I(ACC)
             Drink the water!
            b. Alyu      ngarabiingara-ba îni         galyurringi!
               NEG.IIP drink/drink-FUT this.I.SG.ACC water.I(ACC)
               Don't drink the water!
  (7-177) a. Jiya j-ba      irra      warnu!
             give-TH-FUT 3PL.ACC tobacco.IV(ACC)
             Give them (some) tobacco!
          b. Alyu      irru      warnu        jiyawu/jiya j-ba!
             NEG:IMP 3PL.ACC tobacco.IV(ACC) give/give-TH-FUT
             Don't give them (any) tobacco!","[220, 221]"
"
21 . These reasons could be: a physical or mental inability to; the fact that doing so may he contravening
     social rules or norms; the fact that someone else won't allow you to, ctc.
22 I am indebted to Jane Simpson for this observation.
23 Interestingly, as drawn to my attention by Tracy King, Georgian also has a similar lexicalised distinction
     between two negative particles (Aronson 1989:145).
202     Chapter 7   (7-172) Yangula îrri-ng-a          jiyawu.
              NEG         3PL.A-10-PSTgive
              They didn't give me (my country).
   Apparent counterexamples, such as (7-163) repeated below, in which guyala is translated
with English `won't' rather than `can't', can probably be explained in terms of social/cultural
expectations and notions of appropriateness. Thus, in this example the speaker may be
indicating that she will not send the girl (her granddaughter) to live with another woman,
since she would consider this to be inappropriate for cultural, social, or personal reasons.
              Guyala ng-udi              gamarnda gunyanga-nmanji.
              NEG       1 SG.A-NACT.PR   send     other.II-ALL
              I won't send her to another (girl).
   This semantic difference between the two particles helps to explain their different
behaviour with respect to the irrealis markers in the auxiliary. If guyala is a negative modal
expressing `unlikelihood' then it is not surprising that it should require an irrealis marker in
the auxiliary, since these markers are often used to express modal meanings of `should' and
`would' in positive (usually counterfactual) sentences (see §5.2.4).24
   Verbless clauses are also negated with either guyala or yangula, although of the few
examples in the corpus most contain guyala. As shown in the following examples, the
negative particle may be either initial in the clause (example (7-173)) or initial in the predicate
(7-174).
   (7-173) Guyala Mama                    ngangi                 jugu,           Mama
              NEG       that.I.SG.NOM 2SG.POSS.I(NOM) MB.I(NOM) that.LSG.NOM
              ngangî                 gugu.
              2SG.POSS.I(NOM) MMB.I(NOM)
              That's not your uncle, that's your great uncle.
   (7-174) Yana             janga      yangula ngarrga.
           this.IV.SG.NOM foot.IV(NOM) NEG      I SG.POSS.IV(NOM)
           That's not my foot.","[219, 220]"
"
7.6.2.2 NP NEGATION
   There are a few different techniques for negating the presence or existence of an entity.
Most commonly, the derived nominal guyaliny- is used, taking the negated entity as its dative
argument. The use of this nominal is discussed in detail in §4.4,13.1. An example is:
204    Chapter 7  (7-180) Guyalinya            ngawurniji manganymi-nka.
            lacking.II(NOM) 1 SG.NOM          tucker.III-DAT
            I've got no tucker.
   In other examples, the negative particle guyala is used in its basic form and the negated NP
appears in the dative case. In this constuction guyala appears to function as an existential
negator:
  (7-181) Guyala gaguluna-nka, gagulinya                   ngi          yabu.
            NEG       y.brother.I-DAT y.sister.II(ACC) 1SG.A(PR) have
            No brothers, (but) I have a younger sister.
   In a small number of examples guyala is used, but the negated NP is not in the dative case.
In this construction guyala appears to function as an argument negator. This construction
differs from that in which guyala is used to mark sentential negation as the negative particle is
not in initial position and there is no irrealis marking in the auxiliary. Furthermore, it seems
that guyala in these examples does not have the modal meaning that is associated with its use
as a sentential negator (see §7.6.1).
   (7-182) Jiyawu irr-a         manganyma        guyala.
           give    3PL.A-PST tucker.III(ACC) NEG
           They didn't give her any breakfast. (lit. They gave her no breakfast.)
   (7-183) Nanagunyani îrr-aji           ngarabî, ngawurniji guyala.
           this.II.PL.LOC 3PL.A-HAB.PST drink        IGG.NOM  NEG
           They (my friends) used to drink, but not me.","[221, 222]"
"  As mentioned above, speakers say that there is no difference in meaning between guyala
and yangula constructions and there are cases in which two sentences, one of each type of
negative construction, are said to have the same meaning. Thus:
  (7-164) Guyala ng-udî                    yarru.
             NEG        1SG.S-NACT.PR go
             I'm not going.
  (7-165) Yangula ng-u                 yarru.
             NEG          1SG.S-FUT go
             I'm not going.
   However, despite seemingly equivalent examples such as these, there does appear to be a
semantic difference between the two particles. While yangula seems to be more of a general,
unmarked negation marker, the use of guyala implies that there are external factors, beyond
the actor's control, that prevent (or at least, make unlikely) the execution of the act described
by the proposition.221 Thus, guyala appears to be a negative modal22 indicating
`impossibility' or `unlikelihood', similar to English `can't'. Yangula, on the other hand,
denotes simple propositional negation and is therefore unmarked; it can be used either in
situations in which guyala would be inappropriate (i.e. there are no external forces which
prevent the action from being carried out) or in situations where the existence or absence of
such forces is simply not relevant.23 Some examples illustrating this semantic difference
follow.
  (7-166) Guyala ng-uda                  gajbi manganyma.
             NEG        1 SG.A-NACT.PST eat      tucker.III(ACC)
             I couldn't eat tea (because I kept vomiting).
  (7-167) Guyala wurlu-ny-uda             manku.
             NEG     3DU.A-20-NACT.PST hear
             They didn't hear you (because they were sleeping).
  (7-168) Guyala ng-udi                    ilinga.
             NEG       1 SG.A-NACT.PR remember
             I can't remember (it).
   (7-169) Guyala ng-udi                   ngunjulanyi.
             NEG        1SG.A-NACT.PR lift
             I can't lift (it).
   (7-170) Yangula ngi-ny-a-n                      ngajbi nyamirniji.
             NEG        1SG.A-20-PST-PROG see               2SG.ACC

             NEG          1 SG.A-PST throw

5.2.4.2 THE `HYPOTHETICAL' SUFFIX
  The `hypothetical' suffix -agba (glossed 'HYP') is used in a number of future tense
constructions all of which share the notion that the future event is possible, but not certain»
Examples include:
   (5-62)     Ngangirna               banjirna,          mardima yunumarrga ngîyi-ng-agba
              2SG.POSS.II(NOM) cousin.II(NOM) chase              this.way    3SG.NM.A-I0-HYP
              mirnda            gajigajirra.
              1DU.INC.ACC quickly
              Your cousin might join us soon (lit. might follow us this way soon).
   (5-63)     Angbardî irr-agba barrawu            ngirra,      yarru ngirr-iba.
              build   3PL.A-HYP house.IV(ACC) IPL.EXC.OBL go           IPL.EXC.S NP.AWY
              They might build a house for us, (then) we'll go.
   The hypothetical suffix is the future tense counterpart of the non-actual suffixes in negative
clauses, co-occuring with the negative particles guyala and yangula in negative future tense
constructions:16
13 This is the analysis implicit in Hale's description (1959:ií) and suggested by Jane Simpson (pers.
     comm.).
14 As pointed out by Jane Simpson (pers. comm.), the fact that -u is used in polite imperatives may be
     further support for its general irrealis function: irrealis is often used for politeness, as demonstrated by
     the Aboriginal English ""You might do X for me"" or ""Might be we do X"".
15 In Chadwick (1978) and Nordlinger (1993a), this suffix is considered to he a future tense irrealis suffix.
     However, it is not clear how an future tense irrealis suffix would differ from the simple future tense
     suffix — all future tense constructions being, by definition, irrealis — and thus the analysis given here is
     preferred.
16 Note that this is slightly different from the non-actual suffixes, which are found in negative constructions
     containing the negative particle guyala only; they do not co-occur with the negative particle yanRula. For
     a more detailed discussion of negation see §7.6.
                                                                           The auxiliary   151  (5-64)   Guyala irr-agba yarru.
           NEG    3PL.S-HYP go
           They won't go.
  (5-65)    Yangula gin-agha            guriny-mi mîlama.
           NEG        3SG.M.A-HYP good-FAC again
           He won't be able to fix it again.
   While the large majority of negative future tense constructions contain the hypothetical
suffix, there are a few examples in which the negative particle yangula appears with the
simple future tense suffix -u (example (5-66)). See §7.6 for a more detailed discussion of
negation.
  (5-66)    Yangula ngu-ny-u            daguma.
           NEG        1SG.A-20-FUT hit
            I'm not going to hit you.
  Another main function of the hypothetical suffix is in admonitive constructions, which
warn of a possible danger (examples (5$7) and (5-68)).
  (5-67)   Alyu       lingba j-ba! Ginganbi ny-agba!
           NEG.IMP bogey-TH-FUT drown       2SG.S-HYP
           Don't swim! You might drown!
  (5-68)   Narunguji-ni ngiyi-ny-agba nawu.
           car.IV-LOC    3SG.M.A-20-HYP step.on
           A car might run you over. (lit. A car might step on you.)
The following example combines the negative and admonitive functions:
  (5-69)   Yangula gunu-ng-agba yagu. Gurda ngî-ngg-agba banjanganî
           NEG     3SG.M.A-10-HYP leave be.sick 1SG.A-RR-HYP behind

                                            PREFACE
   Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language originally spoken in the Barkly Tablelands
region of the Northern Territory, Australia. There are perhaps 8-10 fluent speakers
remaining, most of whom live in Tennant Creek and Elliott in the Northern Territory. The
linguistic work which led to this volume was initiated by the Wambaya community (through
the Gurungu Council Aboriginal Corporation in Elliott) out of an increasing concern for the
fate of their language as these few remaining speakers get older. It is hoped that this
(ongoing) work will help younger Wambaya speakers learn something of their language
now, and have some access to their language even when it is no longer being spoken around
them.
   While the main focus of this work has been on Wambaya, substantial reference has also
been made throughout the text to the mutually intelligible dialect Gudanji. The close and long-
term interaction between the Wambaya and Gudanji communities makes it virtually
impossible to work on one dialect without working on the other. Furthermore, the similarly
small number of remaining Gudanji speakers makes any work on this dialect equally urgent.
   The research for this grammar was conducted during six field trips, totalling over seven
months, from February 1991 to August 1994. Work was begun in Elliott, N.T., and then, as
many Elliott Wambaya moved to Tennant Creek, was continued there. There was a lot of
support for the project from the Wambaya/Gudanji people of both Elliott and Tennant Creek.
Although people were not always able to to help me with language material, help came in
many different forms: from helping with the elicitation and transcription of stories, to
providing access to computers and office space, to providing company for the many hours
spent driving between Elliott and Tennant Creek.
   This grammar is a revised version of my Melbourne University MA thesis (Nordlinger
1993a). The revisions include the reanalysis of some earlier analyses (e.g. the treatment of
complex clauses in Chapter 8), and the inclusion of new data collected since the MA thesis
was submitted (e.g. the causal suffix in §4.4.9). Unfortunately, the constraints of time have
made it impossible to cover all areas of Wambaya grammar in the same amount of detail.
Wambaya is a morphologically complex language, and thus these aspects of the grammar
have been given the most attention (Chapters 4-6); other areas have been given less coverage
than they deserve (e.g. complex sentences); and still others have been left out altogether (e.g.
prosody, discourse). Throughout the text I have indicated areas in which more work is
needed in the hope that it can be carried out in the future.
   This grammar is written as a reference grammar. I have therefore deliberately avoided
presenting the data in any particular theoretical framework, or devoting much discussion to
the interesting issues raised by aspects of Wambaya grammar for current theoretical research.
Instead I have tried to describe this interesting language in its own terms, using a substantial
number of naturally occurring examples and texts. My belief is that this will give the
grammatical description the best chance of standing the test of time, and readers the best
chance of discovering things in the language that I have not, perhaps even inspiring more
work on Wambaya before it is too late.                                               xi

   There are only a few particles in Wambaya. Particles have grammatical functions, such as
marking yes/no interrogative clauses, marking negation in declarative and imperative clauses,
and linking two finite clauses into a single complex clause. They are formally distinguished
from adverbs as they have strict positional restrictions: particles almost always occur in initial
position. Particles are discussed in §7.7.2.
3.1.2.3 arms
   Clitics can be distinguished from other non-inflecting word classes as they are bound
forms; they can not stand alone as words.10 There are three clitics in the corpus: =miji, =nima
and =minyi. Miji (glossed INFER') expresses epistemic mood; it indicates that the speaker
considers the proposition to be probable or possible, but does not know for sure whether or
not it is actual. It is an unrestricted clitic and is always encliticised to the initial word of the
clause. Nîma (glossed `NST') can usually be translated by English words such as `just',
`only' and `still', although in some examples it seems to have an emphatic function. It is a
restricted clitic which usually occurs with nominals, although it can also occur with verbs and
other word classes. The other clitic, =minyi (glossed `AGAIN'), is used only with verbs. It is
encliticised to the verb over which it has scope. These three clitics are discussed and
exemplified in §7.7.1.","[70, 71]"

7.7.2 PARTICLES
   There are seven particles in the corpus: the negative particles guyala, yangula and alyu; the
negative interrogative wayi; the exclamative marker gubi and the conjunctions ngaha `THEN'
and gaji `LEST'.30 In addition there are three particles present in Hale's (1959) notes, but not
found in my corpus. These are the interrogative particle gayi and the conjunctions ngabayi
`admonitive' and marda `when'. The two interrogative particles and the three negative
particles were discussed above in §7.5 and §7.6 respectively. The other five particles are
discussed below_

7.5.2 INFORMATION QUESTIONS
   These questions involve the use of an indefinite/interrogative, usually initial in the clause,
that indicates the nature of the information being sought. As in many Australian languages,
indefinite/interrogatives in Wambaya can be used either in interrogative function (e.g. `who',
`what') or as indefinite pronouns (e.g. `someone', `something'). They contain one of five
basic roots: gayinî- `what, who'; inja- `where, which'; yangula `when'; yangulanji `how19 Based on the forms of the auxiliaries and the negative particles he recorded, as well as some of the lexical
    items.

marking in order to cover such meanings as `who, what, with what, for what' and `which,
where to, where from' respectively. Some examples of the interrogative uses of these forms
follow; indefinitermterrogatives are discussed in more detail in §4.7.

which they indicate a lack of knowledge without asking that the information be supplied. This

           Someone must have let the water out behind me.
   The use of =miji with indefinites is similar to that of the particle /pangkal/ `might be, may
be' in Warumungu, which is used to create indefinites from interrogatives (Jane Simpson
pers.comm.). It is also similar to the use of the ignorative clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa
(Donaldson 1980:258ff).27 Note that 'might be' can be used in Aboriginal English in the
same way: Where is X? Might be somewhere.28
73.1.2 =-- NIMA 'JUST'
   The clitic =nima is a restricted clitic that has a number of related emphatic functions,
translating English words such as 'just', 'only' and 'still'. It is most commonly used with
nouns and adjectives, but can also be used with other parts of speech such as verbs (example27 However, the clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa has a different meaning than =miji in wamhaya. as its use with
    other word classes is inferred to be a request for the hearer to affirm or deny the correctness of the
    statement (Donaldson 1980:260). The use of =miji has no such implicature.

    In one example =nîma appears within the word giliyaga 'there'. This word is made up of
gilî `here' and the remote suffix -yaga (this suffix is found on most remote demonstratives;
see §4.6).

           sit     3SG.S-PST here=JUST-remote
           I stayed right there.
    The different uses of =nima are related by the fact that they all se rve to modify
presupposed expectations; the clitic functions as an expectation modifier (McConvell 1983),
highlighting deviation from a presupposition that something more or different would be
expected. In example (7-192), for instance, =nima denies the presupposition that the speaker
would have been given both meat and bread; in (7-195), it denies an expectation that the
travellers would have arrived at their destination already; and in (7-199) the function of =nima
is to deny the presupposition that the speaker went anywhere else. The 'counter-expectation'
meaning of (7-198) is not so obvious. However, this utterance was given in a context in
which the speaker was complaining about the fact that people always come and ask her for
                                                                          Syntax of simple sentences     207tobacco. Thus, =pima seems to be used to assert that the tobacco she carries is for her use
only, and not for anyone else' s 29
7.7.1.3 =MINY/ `AGAIN'
   The clitic -minyi `AGAIN' is used only with verbs. It is attached to the verb over which it
has scope. There are only a few examples of this clitic in the corpus, including:
     (7-200) Bardgu-j-ba=minyi g-u        galyurrungurna.
             fall-TH-FUT=AGAIN 3SG.S-FUT rain.II(NOM)
             It'll rain again.

              She'll come back again.
     (7-202) Gulugi-nka=minyi gi-n                   yugu.
             sleep-DAT=AGAIN 3SG.S(PR)-PROG cry
             He's crying to go back to sleep (i.e. because he's tired).
   As can be seen in the examples above, =minyî can be used with either of the two senses
that McConvell (1983) identi fies for English `again': (i) repetition of an action or situation
and (ii) return to a former position or state. In example (7-200) =minyi indicates repetition of
the full situation: it is true that the event of raining will be repeated. In (7-201) and (7-202) on
the other hand, =minyi indicates only a return to a former state or position, rather than a
repetition of the whole event. Thus (7-202), for example, means that `he' was asleep before
and that he is crying in order to return to that former state of sleeping. It does not mean that
the event of his crying has happened before and is now being repeated. Similarly, (7-201)
describes the situation in which `she' was here and will return to this former position. It does
not refer to a repetition of the event of returning.","[222, 223, 224, 225]"
"    The distribution of the future verbal suffix, which is found in imperative clauses and
positive future tense clauses, suggests that `future tense' may not be the best characterisation
of the function of this suffix. It is also not possible to treat it as a general irrealis mood suffix,
since it is not found in negative future tense clauses, nor in examples in which an irrealis
mood suffix appears on the auxiliary (see §5.2.4). The function of this suffix is complex and
still not fully understood and thus, in lieu of further research, I will refer to it as the `future
tense' suffix, while acknowledging the term's inadequacies. See Nordlinger (1996) for
further discussion.",[182]
"
7.1.2 HAVING/LACKING CLAUSES
   These clauses are just a specialised type of ascriptive clause having as their predicate a
nominal inflected with either the proprietive or the privative suffix. Like other ascriptive
clauses they attribute a property to the subject (i.e. that of having or lacking a particular object
or quality), and must agree with it in case (nominative), gender and number.
    (7-12)    Ngawurniji gijilulu-wajarna.
              I SG.NOM        money-PRIV.II(NOM)
              I've got no money. (lit. I am money-lacking.)
    (7-13)   Bulînja-ngujî        înî                 galyurrîngî!
             algae-PROP.I(NOM) this.I.SG.NOM water.I(NOM)
             This water's got algae in it! (lit. This water is algae-having.)
  In another example, a normal ascriptive clause takes a `having' construction as a
complement. In this example the subject has been omitted.3
    (7-14)   Wawunyg-ujî              gurijbi   ngabulu-nguji.
             sugar.bag-PROP.I(NOM) good.l(NOM) milk-PROP.I(NOM)
             It's good with milk and sugar.
    There is another type of 'lacking' clause in which the predicate is the derived nominal
guyaliny- 'lacking'. This nominal is derived from the negative particle guyala and is inflected
for gender, agreeing with the subject of the clause.4 Guyaliny- can appear alone in the
predicate (example (7-15)), or be accompanied by a dative complement which expresses what
it is that is lacking ((7-16) and (7-17)). When there is no dative complement (as in (7-15)),
the object that is lacking is considered to be clear from context.
    (7-15)   Ngawurniji guyalinya!
             1 SG.NOM     Iacking.II(NOM)
             I have nothing! (when asked for money)
    (7-16)   Guyalinjî       manganymi-nka.
             lacking.I(NOM) bread.IlI-DAT
             (He) has no bread.",[193]
"   Note that guyala functions both as an interjection meaning `no, nothing' and as a particle
negating a clause, as in guyala nguda yarru `I didn't go'. This is the only other exception to
the mutually exclusivity of word class membership. Interestingly Evans (1995a:87) gives
warirra `nothing' as the only Kayardild word that may belong to more than one word class,
serving both as a nominal and an interjection.' 1
3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
3.2.1 CORE FUNCTIONS, ADJUNCTS AND COMPLEMENTS
  Grammatical relations (or grammatical functions), such as subject, object, indirect object,
complement and adjunct, are important in describing many syntactic and morphological
10 Note that the auxiliary is essentially a bundle of clitics. However, its special status in Wambaya
      grammar warrants its treatment as a distinct part of speech.
1 l Bill McGregor (pers.comm.) points out that the possible use of guyala as an interjection does not
      necessarily justify the claim that it belongs to more than one word class since it is not uncommon in
      languages for words of other classes to be used as complete utterances of their own, as in the use of
       `Man!' in English, for example. However, the two uses of guyala have different characteristics — as a
      particle, for example, guyala must co-occur with counter-factual mood marking in the auxiliary (see
       §7.6.I.1)— and thus are considered members of different word classes here.
54    Chapter 3processes in Wambaya. While these functions all have close associations with semantic roles,
the semantic roles are not necessarily invariant; a particular grammatical function may have
one semantic role with one verb, and a different semantic role with another. The role of
grammatical functions, therefore, is to provide the link between the surface morphological
and/or syntactic structure and the semantic level at which lexical predicates select arguments
with specific semantic roles (Bresnan 1982:288).
   Distinctions can be made within the grammatical functions according to two main
parameters: whether or not the function is subcategorisable by a verb, and whether the
function is semantically restricted, or semantically unrestricted.12 The criterion of sub-
categorisability separates adjuncts from other types of grammatical relations. Adjuncts are
never subcategorised for and can potentially occur with any verb. Adjuncts are semantically
transparent in that an adjunct's meaning is consistent and predictable and is not affected by
the verb with which it may occur.
   Among the subcategorisable functions, namely subject, object, indirect object and
complements, a distinction can be made according to whether or not the function is
semantically restricted (i.e. is only ever linked to an argument having a particular semantic
role) or semantically unrestricted (i.e. can be linked to any type of argument) (Bresnan
1982:293-294). Thus we can distinguish core functions (subject, object, indirect object) from
complements on this basis.13 Core functions are always subcategorisable and are
semantically unrestricted in that their meaning (i.e. their semantic role) is dependent upon the
verb of which they are an argument. Thus, the subject of one verb may have the semantic role
of agent, but that of another may be a perceiver or an undergoer. Similarly semantic roles
such as patient, perceived entity and location may all be paired with the grammatical function
of object subcategorised for by different verbs. Complements on the other hand, although
subcategorisable,14 are more closely linked with specific semantic roles and have a consistent
and predictable way of contributing to the meaning of the sentence (Andrews 1985:92).
Complements, therefore, form the middle ground so to speak, between semantically
transparent and non-subcategorisable adjuncts on the one end and semantically non-
transparent and subcategorisable core functions on the other.
   Some examples and a brief discussion of the types of complements and adjuncts found in
Wambaya follow. As the core functions are always subcategorised for, and are directly
related to, the verb of which they are an argument, they are discussed in §7.2, which deals
with the syntax of simple verbal clauses, and verb argument structures.
   Complements have invariant meanings which are related to, and easily characterised in
terms of, their case marking. Yet, unlike adjuncts, they can combine with only certain verbs,
and would therefore be part of a full dictionary entry for their governing verb. A verb such as
12 This terminology and the system of classification of grammatical relations is taken from Bresnan
    (1982:287).
13 Note that I use the term `indirect object' to refer to a type of object that is marked with an oblique case
    (usually dative). This is in contrast to what I simply refer to as `objects', which are marked with
    accusative case. Bresnan (1982) does not make such a distinction; in Bresnan's classification, these are
    both a type of object.
14 Note that there is a slight difference here in the use of the word `subcategorisable'. The sub-
    categorisability of complements is different from that of core functions in that core functions are
    generally obligatory (i.e. a transitive verb has an obligatory subject and object) while complements are
    more often optional (i.e. a verb of motion can have an optional ablative or allative complement
    indicating the source or the direction of the motion).
                                                                 Parts of speech and other preliminaries   55junmi `cut' can take a complement indicating the instrument used (example (3-17)); and
motion verbs such as bardgu `fall' and yarru `go' can take a complement in the allative case
(3-18) or the ablati ve case (3-19) denoting the direction or source of the movement.

   Some verbs subcategorise for . `subject complements' — secondary predicates sub-
categorised for by the verb and agreeing in case, number and gender with the subject. An
example of this is the verb manku in its sense 'to feel', which subcategorises for a reflexive
object and a subject complement denoting the state of affairs of the subject:
     (3-20) Manku ngî-ngg-a baginga.
            feel      I SGA-RR-NF bad.II(NOM)
            I feel no good.
   Similarly, perception verbs can subcategorise for what could be considered an `object.
complement' — a secondary predicate which modifies the object, denoting the state in which
the object is perceived:15

   Like complements, adjuncts have consistent meanings which remain unaffected by the
nature of the verb with which they occur. However; unlike complements, adjuncts are not
selected by verbs and can potentially co-occur with any type of verb in a clause. Typical
examples of adjuncts include locative phrases (example (3-22)), temporal phrases (3-23),
benefactive dative phrases (3-24) and secondary predicates (3-25).

1    Wambaya is alone among the McArthur dialects in inflecting the verb for tense: in neither Gudanji nor
     Binbinka is the verb inflected in main clauses (Chadwick 1978:84). In Ngarnga, the verb also shows a
     future/non-future contrast: however, interestingly, the basic verb form (i.e. that which corresponds to the
     non-future verb form in Wambaya) is used in the future tense, while verbs in past and present tenses are
     inflected with the suffix -ani (p.85).
2    The thematic      of 7 Class verbs also appears before derivational suffixes such as -barli- 'AGNT' and
     -baja- 'PRIV'. For example:
         dag    j-moi hit-TH-AGNT (I)
         daguma j-baji     hit-TH-PRIV (I)
3.   The non-future tense form of a verb is also the citation form, and thus is more like a general unmarked
     form (see below).
                                                     157
158    Chapter 6   Note that the three nominal suffixes -ni, -nka and -nnga are preceded here with /i/. This is
an epenthetic vowel which occurs between the final consonant of a verb stem (whether this
consonant is the final consonant of the root itself, or the thematic consonant /j/) and a
following suffix with an initial nasal. The epenthetic vowel breaks up what would otherwise
be an impossible consonant cluster. (A nasal can be the second element of a consonant cluster
only when it is preceded by a hetero-organic nasal; see §2.2.3). When the details of verbal
morphological structure are not significant I will not segment this epenthetic vowel in
examples in this work, but will group it with the preceding morpheme. For example:
      daguma ji-nka     hit-TH-DAT (NOT daguma j-î-nka )
      ngarli-nka        talk-DAT    (NOT ngarl-i-nka)
   Some examples of inflected verbs from each class are given in Table 6.2. Due to lack of
space, the inflection of only one of the nominal suffixes (-nka) is exemplified. Irregular verbs
are given in Table 6.4 below. In all of the following tables an underline indicates that the
corresponding form is not present in the corpus.

   *Note that the final consonant of this root is dropped before an inflection with initial /b/. I
have no explanation for this as /gb/ is a permissible consonant cluster in Wambaya (e.g.
gulugbi `sleep'). See §2.2.3 for a discussion of consonant clusters in Wambaya.
   As can be seen in Table 6.2, membership of the two conjugation classes is phonologically
determined: verbs with vowel-final roots belong to the J Class and those with consonant-final
roots belong to the 0 Class.
                                                                                   Verbs    159   An alternative analysis for the verbs of the J Class would be to consider the /j/ as in fact
belonging to the verb root, rather than being thematic. Under this analysis the non-future
suffix would still be -0, but the final consonant of the root would be dropped according to
the general phonotactic constraint that words in Wambaya be vowel-final (see §2.2).
However, if the roots of J Class verbs contain a final /j/, then there is no obvious explanation
as to why these verbs belong to a different class than other verbs, such as ngaj- `see', which
also have fj/-final roots. Under the `thematic /jr analysis however, this inconsistency is
avoided as the roots of these two verbs are different: one (daguma-) is vowel-final and the
other (ngaj-) is consonant-final.
  There is some evidence, however, to suggest that /j/ may once have been part of the verbal
root, or even part of the non-future inflection, -bi. For example, many of the verbs of the J
Class have cognates in other languages/dialects of the Eastern. Group that have final
jbi in the non-future fornt4

   One of the particularly interesting things about the Wambaya verbal inflections is their
striking similarity to some of the verbal inflections in Garrwa, a language which borders
Wambaya but appears otherwise unrelated to it. According to the analysis of Garrwa verbs
proposed by Belfrage (1992:46), Garrwa has five verbal conjugation classes. Of these five
there are two which show substantial similarity to the two Wambaya classes and are also
referred to by Belfrage as the J conjugation class and the 0 conjugation class. Table 6.3 gives
the forms of the inflections for these two Garrwa verbal conjugation classes.
    TABLE 6.3: GARRWA J AND 0 CONJUGATION CLASSES (FROM BELFRAGE 1992:46)                                            J              0

                        Infinitive          -(j)kanyi      -(bi)kanyi
   Thus, Class J verbs in Garrwa have the same /jb/ sequence in their unmarked form that is
so distinctive to verbs in Wambaya. Furthermore, the unmarked inflections of these two
classes in Garrwa are identical to the future tense inflections that occur in the respective
Wambaya classes. And the Wambaya non-future inflection, -bi, turns up (optionally) before4   The Ngamga information is taken from Chadwick (1971). The Gudanji information is from my own
    field notes.
160    Chapter 6the other inflections of the 0 Class in Garrwa. Another point of comparsion is the Garrwa
`same subject' inflection which is very similar in form to the `same subject' inflection (i.e. the
ergative/locative case) in the J Class in Wambaya: j-ini. This inflection in Wambaya is used
to mark same subject in non-finite clauses that are simultaneous with the main clause (see
§8.1). In Wambaya this inflection is analysed as consisting of the thematic consonant r/,
followed by the epenthetic vowel /i/ and then the ergative/locative case inflection -ni. The
Garrwa inflection also appears to be based on the locative inflection, which is -na in Garrwa
(Belfrage 1992:13). Although it is not unusual for the locative case inflection to be used to
mark same subject in this region (see Austin 1981b), it is interesting here that the two
inflections both precede the locative suffix with the sequence /ji/. In Garrwa however, unlike
Wambaya, the full form -jina is also used with the 0 Class. In Wambaya the form that occurs
with the 0 Class is -ini. There is clearly need for more detailed comparative work between
these two languages.
   There are a number of irregular Wambaya verbs which do not belong to either of the two
conjugation classes discussed here. Table 6.4 gives the forms of such verbs that are present
in the corpus, along with the regular verbs daguma `hit' and ngajbi `see' for comparison
(non-italicised). A question mark indicates that the form given is hypothesised, but not
confirmed.

gajurru and nanganangali have irregular infinitive forms and gajurru, along with ganjimi, has
an irregular future tense form. The remaining five verbs are irregular in that they do not
distinguish future and non-future tense. Furthermore, verbs such as yarru and gannga have
alternative infinitive and/or DAT forms, one of which contains the corresponding regular J
Class inflection. Yugu takes the 0 Class infinitive inflection but the J Class DAT inflection.

6.1 INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY
6.1.1 NON-FUTURE INFLECTION
   As discussed above, the non-future suffix is either -0 (with vowel-final stems) or -bi
(with consonant-final stems). The non-future form of the verb is also the citation form of the
verb and thus may in fact be better considered as the unmarked form. The non-future
inflection is used in both past and present tenses and can also be used in the immediate future
tense (examples (6-1) and (6-2)) in which case it is accompanied by future tense marking in
the auxiliary. This is one case in which there is a mismatch between the tense marking in the
auxiliary and that on the verb.5

            go(FUT) SG.IMP.TWD this.way THEN 1DU.INC.S-FUT talk-NF
            Come here so that we can talk!
  The non-future form of the verb can also be found in some imperative constructions:
  (6-3)     Alyu nyi-ng-a                  daguma-0!
            NEG.IMP 2SG:A-IO-NF            hit-NF

  (6-4)     Bard-bi garna!
            run-NF SG:IMP.AWY
            Run over there!
  Imperative constructions are discussed in more detail in §6.1.2.
   Its appearance in some future and imperative constructions as well as the fact that it is
always the citation form of the verb suggests that the non-future form is really more like an
unmarked verb form. Therefore, I will treat it as unmarked in example sentences elsewhere in
this work:
     dagunta      hit    (not 'hit(NF)')
     ngajbi      see (not ngaj-bi `see-NF')
6.1.2 FUTURE INFLECTION
   The future tense suffix is -ba, or -wa after liquids. As well as being used in future tense
clauses (examples (6-5) and (6-6)), the future tense suffix also marks imperative mood ((6-7)
and (6-8)). While they contain the same verbal inflection, an imperative construction is
distinguished from a future tense construction since the auxiliary in an imperative
    See Table 6.5 for the possible combinations of verbal and auxiliary tense categories.
162     Chapter 6
construction usually carnes non-future tense marking (6-7) while in a future tense
construction it carries future tense marking (6-5). (See §5.5 for a discussion of the auxiliary
in imperative constructions and Table 6.5 for the interaction between auxiliary and verbal
tense categories). Recall that a future tense construction, such as in example (6-5), can have a
polite imperative reading (see §5.5 for more examples).

              talk-FUT mother.II-DAT
              Talk to your mother!
   In two types of imperative constructions — negative imperative constructions and
constructions containing imperative directional suffixes — it is possible for the verb to appear
without future tense marking. Examples include (6-3) and (6-4) above, and the following:
    (6-9)     A lyu     junmi/junmi-j-ba!
              NEG.IMP cut(NF)/Cut-TH-FUT
              Don't cut it!
    (6-10) Alyu      nyi-ng-a   daguma/daguma j-ba!
           NEG.IMP 2SG.A-IO-NF hit(NF)/hit-TH-FUT
           Don't hit me!
    (6-11)    Wugbardi gama!      OR Wugbardi -j-ba gama!
              cook(NF) SG.IMP.AWY    cook-TH-FUT
              Go and cook it!
    (6-12)    Gaj-bi girrama!   OR Gaj-ba girrama!
              eat-NF PL.IMP.TWD    eat-FUT
              Come and eat!
   The absence of future tense marking in these constructions can probably be accounted for
by the fact that the negative particle and the directional suffixes are specifically imperative.
Thus, with their presence the clause is already marked as imperative, rendering it unnecessary
for this to be also indicated on the verb.
   Verbs such as yarru `go' and yabu `take, have', which do not distinguish future and non-
future tense (see Table 6.4 above), always co-occur with directional suffixes in the imperative
mood. As these directional suffixes are inherently imperative, it is thus possible to make a
distinction between imperative clauses and future tense clauses with these verbs.6
6     Note that, as these verbs make no distinction between future and non-future tenses, the glossing of them
      as `FUT' in these examples is, to a certain extent, arbitrary.

            He will take her to (her) mother.
   The fact that these verbs often occur with directional suffixes, which themselves mark
imperative mood and tense (in indicative clauses), may explain why it is that they are not
overtly inflected for tense themselves; we have already seen examples in which the verbal
inflection is omitted when it co-occurs with directional suffixes (examples (6-11) and (6-12)
above). However, even in clauses without directional suffixes, these verbs are not overtly
inflected for future tense:
  (6-17)    Yarru       ng-u   marndijî.
            go(FUT) 1 SG.S-FUT later
            I'll go later.
  (6-18)    Yabu       ny-u         garnguji alaji.
            have(FUT) 2SG.A-FUT many.I(ACC) boy.I(ACC)
            You'll have lots of kids.
   The future tense inflection is used both in imperative constructions (as discussed above)
and in future tense constructions (examples (6-5) and (6-6)). In clauses with immediate future
tense however, and in negative future tense clauses, the verb occurs in the non-future form.
For examples of clauses with immediate future tense see (6-1) and (6-2). Some examples of
future tense negative clauses follow.
  (6-19)    Yangula irr-agba        jiyawu.
            NEG       3PLA-HYP give(NF)
            They will not give it to him.

            NEG         tSG.A-HYP drink-NF tomorrow
            I will not drink tomorrow.
   Table 6.5 shows the possible combinations of auxiliary and verbal tense categories.?
Recall that the tense categories of the auxiliary differ depending on the number of the subject
bound pronoun and the presence/absence of an object bound pronoun (§5.2.1). Thus, some
auxiliaries will collapse some of the distinctions made in this table. Note also that some of
these marking patte rns are optional; that is auxiliaries in imperative constructions can actually
have no tense marking at all (see §5.5).","[175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]"

   There are two `non-actual' suffixes: -udî/-uji marks `non-actual present tense' (glossed
`NACT.PR') and -uda/--uja 'non-actual past tense' (glossed `NACT.PST'). These suffi xes are
used to mark non-future tense irrealis events: events that are not occurring or did not occur,
although it is conceivable, and probably expected, that they might have. In some contexts
there is an associated implicature that the actuality of the event would have been preferable
(example (5-54)).
    These suffixes each have two allomorphs, conditioned by the number of the subject bound
pronoun in the auxiliary in which they occur. The allomorphs with the alveolar stop (-udi
`non-actual present tense' and -uda `non-actual past tense') occur when the subject pronoun
is singular (examples (5-53), (5-54), (5-55)). The other allomorphs occur when the subject is
non-singular (5-56), (5-57).

            NEG      3DU.A-RR-NACT.PR hit
            They never fight with each other.
  The third person singular masculine transitive bound pronoun can occur with either form:
  (5-58)    Guyala guru-nÿ-udi                manku.
            NEU       3SG.M.A-20-NACT.PR. hear

            He should have cooked some tucker for his mother.
  When attached directly to one of the plural subject bound pronouns ngirri ` I PL.EXC', girri
`2PL' or irri '3PL', the non-actual suffixes have the forms -iji and -ija respectively:
      ngirriji t PL.EXC.S/A-NACT.PR
      girrija 2PL.S/A-NACT.PST
      irriji   3PL.S/A-NACT.PR
   These non-actual suffixes (-udi/ uji, uda/-uja) appear to be made up of the suffix -a (the
future tense suffix, see §5.2.1) and a tense component: -di/-ji 'present tense', -da/-ja `past
150     Chapter 5
tense'.13 This suggests that -u may be a more general irrealis marker, interpreted as a future
tense marker when no further inflection is present. For simplicity, however, and since future
tense is now its primary function in Wambaya, I will continue to gloss the suffix -u as 'FUT',
and will treat the non-actual suffixes as portmanteau morphemes, as in the examples above.l 4
   The non-actual suffixes are most commonly used with the negative particle guyala
(examples (5-53), (5-55), (5-57), (5-58)). They can also be used without guyala however, to
indicate that something that was not done should have been done (5-54), (5-59) or that
something would have been done in a hypothetical situation (5-56). They can also be used to
express the meaning of `want' (with the implication that what is wanted is not possible):
   (5-60)     Gambanga-ni ng-udi                 mirra.
              sun.II-LOC         ISG.S-NACT.PR sit

7.7 CLITICS AND PARTICLES
7.7.1 CLITICS
7.7.1.1 =MIJT `INFERential'
   The clitic =mijî is used to mark epistemic mood and is encliticised to the first word of the
clause. Like the epistemic uses of the modals `must' and `might' in English, the use of =miji
indicates that the speaker has drawn an inference or conclusion as to the truth of the
proposition on the basis of available information.26 The most common usage of =miji in
Wambaya is as in examples (7-184) to (7-186), in which it denotes probability; the
information available to the speaker suggests that the proposition is likely to be true. In these
examples =mijî is translated by speakers into English as `must be'.
   (7-184) Ngangaba        yana            gi-n              najbî. Garnguji=miji

1.2 ITS SPEAKERS
1.2.1 HISTORY
   The West Barkly communities have suffered greatly since European settlement, losing
virtually all their traditional land to white pastoralists well over a century ago. Survival by
II   This looks suspiciously like Gurindji, but he claims that the country belonging to these people lies to
     the east of Powell Creek in the Northern Territory.
I2   Actually, although called Wambaya, the forms of the auxiliary, the negative particles and many of the
     lexical items contained in these field notes suggest that the dialect Hale recorded is one closer to Gudanji
     than Wambaya.
                                                                       The language and its speakershunting and food-gathering was replaced by subsistence primarily on station rations, given in
return for work. All the older people that I have worked with, and many of the younger
people, have spent a significant amount of time employed on cattle stations; the men as
stockmen and the women as housemaids and the like.
   Little has been written that gives much information about the history of these communities.
The references to them found in the literature are brief and usually mention only their
location.13 A typical mention is found in Basedow (1907:3):
        The Binbinga, a peaceful tribe, occupies the McArthur River district for 40 miles
      south of Borroloola.
        The Godangee (probably a branch of the Gnanji), adjoins the Binbinga on the
      east.
        The Yumpia (Umbaia) lives in country extending south of the Binbinga, to the
      tablelands. Both this tribe and the former are noted for cattle-killing.
        The Angee and Anga (no doubt branches of the Nganji [sic]) are small, hostile
      tribes, living south and west of the Allaua, at the head of the Wickham River.
   Thus, most of the information for the following discussion has come from the Wambaya
and Gudanji people that I have worked with, and cannot be supported by information from
other sources.
   Most of the Wambaya and Gudanji people14 moved off the stations on their land during
the 1960s and 1970s. The reason for this, as explained to me by the people themselves,, is
that they were forceably moved off the stations by Welfare, who felt that the stations could
not provide enough food and health care to support the communities. However, this may not
have been the only reason as the movement off the stations appears to coincide with the
granting of award (equal) wages and citizenship in 1967, which resulted in the forcible
removal of Aboriginal residents from stations to towns in many regions of northern
Australia.15 The majority of these people moved into the towns of Elliott, Tennant Creek and
Borroloola.l 6
   This shift into country belonging to other people, and the subsequent split-up of their
communities, had disastrous effects for the Wambaya and Gudanji people, significantly
contributing to the loss of their language and much of their ceremonial life. While living on
`foreign' land they could not practise much of their ceremony and had to use languages such
as Kriol to communicate with the other communities, thereby reducing the use of their own
languages. John Avery's (1990:5) impression of the circumstances of these communities
during the mid 1970s is that they ""stood at the end of every queue, whether it was for town.
employment, housing or other such benefits, an d they were dependent on other Aboriginal
people for their participation in ceremonial life"". My impression is that, at least with respect to
the latter point, the current situation is only slightly better than it was at the time of this
observation.","[24, 25]"
"
4.7 LNDEFLNITE/INTERROGATIVES58
   There are five indefinite/interrogative roots in the corpus, which are used to indicate that
the (full) identity of the referent is unknown to the speaker. These forms are frequently used
in interrogative function, requesting the information about the referent's identity from the
addressee. This interrogative function, however, cannot be considered a part of the core
meaning of these forms as they can be used contexts that are not compatible with an
interrogative meaning, namely those in which they co-occur with the inferential enclitic =mijî
(see below).59 When combined with their various inflections, these five roots cover the
meanings 'someone, who', 'something, what', 'something, which', `for something, why',
'somewhere, where', `from somewhere, where from', 'some amount, how many/how
57 The alternation in the vowel of the stem is triggered by the following high back vowel of the dual suffix.
58 In Nordlinger 1993a I used the term 'ignorative' for this word class (following Karcevski 1969 and more
     recently Wierzbicka (e.g. 1980)). However, as Mushin (1991, 1995)   .      has pointed out, there are two
     components to these words: an ignorative component (which indicates that knowledge is at issue) and an
     epistemological component (which characterises the type of knowledge at issue). For this reason the
     more neutral term 'indefinite/interrogative' has been chosen. In other discussions of Australian languages
     these words have been referred to as `interrogatives' (e.g. Dixon 1972, 1977, Merlan 1994), 'inter-
     rogative/indefinite pronouns' (e.g. Austin 1981a, Morphy, 1983), 'indefinite pronouns' (Dench 1995),
     'indeterminates' (Donaldson 1980) and 'epistememes' (Mushin 1991, 1995).
59 This discussion has benefited from McGregor's (1990:146ff) discussion of such forms in Gooniyandi.
120 Chapter 4much', `sometime, when' and `somehow, how'.60 There is a strong tendency for indefinite/
interrogatives to be initial in the clause.
   As indicated by the term used, indefinite/interrogatives are found with two different
functions in the corpus: indefinite (4-249) and interrogative (4-250).61 In the former
function, they often co-occur with the enclitic -miji `INFER' (7.7.1.1).
   (4-249) Gayina=miji                       irr-a dîdîma.
             something.IV(ACC)=INFER 3PL.A-PST     tell
             They (must have) told him something./I don't know what they told him.
  (4-250) Gayina             irr-a       didima.
          something.IV(ACC) 3PL.A-PST tell
          They told him something./What did they tell him?
   Each of these examples expresses the fact that the speaker does not know what it was that
the subject told the object. As far as I can tell, the difference between the indefinite meaning
of example (4-249) and that of (4-250) is that in the former the speaker is indicating that
he/she is only inferring that anything was `told' at all. Such examples are often translated in
Aboriginal English using `must be', as in `I don't know what they told him, must be
something.'
   I will now discuss each of these indefinite/interrogatives individually. A general
interrogative particle is discussed in §7.5.1.","[137, 138]"
"
7.7.2.4 NGABAY/ `LEST'
   This particle is present in Hale's (1959) notes, but is not present in my corpus. Hale
describes it as an admonitive complementiser and it appears to be used in much the same way
as gaji, discussed in §7.7.2.3 above. Its resemblance to the particle ngaba, which is also
contained in Hale's data, is noteworthy, but more research is needed to determine what the
relationship may be between the two forms. An example from Hale's notes is:
   (7-218) Ilagbi      ngî       nganga ngabayi nyi-ng-a      majbi.
           frightened 1SG.S(PR) 2SG.OBL LEST      2SG.A-10-NF hit
           I'm afraid you might hit me. (1959:55)
  Hale notes that ngabayî can also be used in conditional constructions with the irrealis
marker in the auxiliary, as in the following example:
   (7-219) Ngabayi ng-uda                 yabu balamurru         dudiyarri ng-uda
            LEST(?) ISG.A-NACT.PST have           spear.IV(ACC) spear       I SGA-NACT.PST
            iniya           marndija=nima.
            that.I.SG.ACC before=NST
            If I had had a spear, I would have speared him then. (1959:54)
7.7.2.5 MARDA `WHEN'
   Marda is another particle which is present in Hale's (1959) corpus, but not in mine
(although Hale does not list marda in the sketch grammar at the beginning of his notes).
There are only a couple of examples in his corpus in which marda appears; in both of these it
introduces a clause temporally prior to the main clause and can be translated as `when':

             When I was young, I spoke my language Wambaya. (1959:55)
     (7-221) Marda ngu-ny-u           ngajbî jiyawu ngu-ny-u       manganyma.

               When I see you I'll give you some food. (1959:55)
  In my corpus, such clauses are usually just juxtaposed with the main clause, signalled
only by a rising intonation (see Chapter 8 for further discussion).
     (7-222) Guyalinja        ngabulu-nka, duwa gî.

types: those in which one of the clauses is non-finite and subordinate to the other clause, and
those in which both clauses are finite. In_ the latter type, the finite clauses are simply
juxtaposed and there is no evidence that one is syntactically subordinate to the other. I will

                                                CHAPTER 1                         THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS1.1 THE LANGUAGE
    Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language from the Barkly Tablelands region in the
northern central part of the Northern Territory. It belongs to the West Barkly language
family, which occupies an area of the central Northern Territory very roughly bounded by
Daly Waters in the north-west, Borroloola in the north-east, Brunette Downs Station in the
south-east and Renner Springs in the south-west (see Maps 1 and 2). The West Barkly
languages are part of a larger subgroup known as the Mirndi group which also contains the
Jaminjungan languages: Jaminjung, Ngaliwuru and Nungali. The location of these languages
is shown in Map 1.
   Phonologically, Wambaya is fairly typical for an Australian language. The phoneme
inventory contains five places of articulation for stops (bilabial, alveolar, postalveolar, palatal
and velar), with a nasal corresponding to each stop articulation. Voicing is not phonemically
distinctive. There are three laterals corresponding to the three non-peripheral stop articulations
(alveolar, postalveolar and palatal), an alveolar tap/trill, three semivowels: /w/, Lr,,/ and /j/, and
three vowels: [i], [u] and [a], with no significant phonemic length distinction. In all of the
other West Barkly languages there is a sixth stop articulation, a dorso-palatal, described by
Chadwick (1978:9) as having an onset near the front of the velum and a palatalised release.
This stop does not occur in Wambaya and I have only ever heard one example of it in
Gudanji_ Wambaya words are mostly disyllabic or longer and, except for the auxiliary, never
end in a consonant.
   There are seven parts of speech in Wambaya: nominals (including nouns, adjectives,
demonstratives, free pronouns and time and locational nominals), verbs, adverbs, the
auxiliary (including cross-referencing bound pronouns and tense/aspect/mood/directional
suffixes), particles, clitics and interjections.
   Pronouns distinguish person (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and number (singular, dual and plural).
First person non-singular makes an inclusive/exclusive distinction, and a gender distinction is
made in the third person singular.
   Wambaya nominals generally inflect for case, gender' and number. Although there are
three numbers — singular, dual and plural — only dual nouns are obligatorily marked for
number. All modifiers must agree with the noun that they modify in all of these categories.
   There are four genders in Wambaya, marked by suffixes. In this respect Wambaya and the
other West Barkly languages are typologically aberrant, as gender in other non-Pama-
Nyungan languages, along with much of the verbal morphology, is usually marked by
prefix.'- In fact, apart from the West Barkly languages, the only other non-Pama-Nyungan    I follow Corbett (1991:5) in using this term for what are more traditionally referred to as 'noun classes'.
2   The Jarrakan languages also have genders marked solely by suffixes (Ian Green, pers.comm.).

languages which are not prefixing in at least the verbal domain a re the Tangkic languages,
such as Kayardild and Lardil.3
   The four genders in Wambaya are masculine (Class I), feminine (Class II), vegetable
(Class III) and neuter (Class Iv). Class membership is primarily semantically based. There are
two series of gender suffixes: those which occur in the nominative and accusative cases
(absolutive) and those which occur in all other cases (non-absolutive).4 Gender is marked on
nouns, adjectives, demonstratives and some indefinite/interrogatives.
   Wambaya is a `split-ergative' language: nominals (excluding free pronouns) have an
ergative-absolutive pattern of inflection while the free pronouns have a nominative/accusative
declension. Following Goddard (1982), the class of nominals as a whole is analysed as
having a three-way case system: ergative (/locative), nominative and accusative (see §4.4).
   A second position auxiliary, obligatorily present in most Wambaya clauses, contains
bound pronouns representing the subject and object arguments of the clause. This auxiliary
also contains most of the tense, aspect and mood information for the clause, and can contain
directional affixes indicating movement towards or away from the speaker. Unusually, the
auxiliary has no root.
   Some further unusual aspects of Wambaya grammar include: a subjective/objective
distinction that is made by some adjectives (see §3.1), a suffix found with kinship nominals
which appears to have a reflexive possessive function (see §4.5.1.2) and some verbs which
alternate in transitivity without changing their form (see §7.2.7).
   As is common for Australian languages, Wambaya is morphologically agglutinative and
the word order is relatively free.","[18, 19, 20]"

7.6.2 CONSTITUENT NEGATION
7.6.2.1 THE USE OF THE PRIVATIVE SUFFIX
  The privative suffix can be added to a verb X to derive a nominal with the meaning `one
who doesn't or is unable to x'. Thus, this suffix is used to negate a quality or action.
Examples of the use of this suffix with verbs are given in §4.4.12. Some others are given
here for further exemplification.
   (7-178) Yugu-waji,          mirrang-ba g-u         mama          ayigurrajbi
             cry-PRIV.I(NOM) sit-FUT      3SG.S-FUT that.I.SG.NOM all.day
            ngaji-ni ngurra.
            see-LOC IPL.INC.ACC
            He doesn't cry, he'll (just) sit there all day looking at us.
   (7-179) Baralala ng-a           mîrra gulug-bajarna
           all.night ISG.S-PST sit            sleep-PRIV.II(NOM)
           I couldn't sleep all night (lit. I  was sleepless all night).",[221]
"
      I am not sure as to the structure of this phrase. I think that gulyagulya may mean 'son' although I have
      never heard it used outside of this text, and, while ngarri and gurla are clearly the pronouns
       LSG.POSS.ICNOM)' and `2DU.ACC respectively, I do not understand the use of gulinya. which means
      'daughter'. I have therefore just translated it in the way that it was translated by MG: ""my two sons, my
      two sons"".
      The translation here does not accurately reflect the structure of the Wambaya sentence but I do not know
      how else it could be translated. As far as I can determine the meaning is that the people arc causing the
      smoke to rise. I do not know why the word used is 'fire' and not 'smoke'.
      I do not understand why the habitual past tense is used here - unless it can also function as a distant past.
      This is something to be checked.
      This phrase is important to the story but I am not really sure of its meaning. MG translates it as
      ""l0000ng way"" and said that bulyawu is a name that the Eaglehawk has just created for a fictitious piece
      of country where she is claiming the men are.

 34 The problem is not with the verbless sentence as MG accepts them as grammatical when the NP contains
     only one proprietive nominal. For example:
          Alaji        darranggu-nguji.
          boy.l(NOM) stick-PROP.l(NOM)
          The boy has a stick.
      It is possible that this difference may reflect a dialectal difference between Gudanji and Wambaya: MG,
      who rejects e.:amples in which the proprietive has phrasal scope, is a Wambaya speaker. MH, on the
      other hand, who accepts such examples, speaks a dialect that is predominantly Gudanji (with some
      W""ambaya mixed in). Th is will have to be explored further in the field.
 35 The morphophonemic processes that generate these forms are discussed in §2.3.

           *These forms are in free variation with -waji, -wajarna and so on in this environment.
   The non-absolutive forms of the Class I and II suffixes are -bajini-/-wajîni- (etc.) and
-bajanga-/-wajanga- (etc.), respectively. The Class Iv non-absolutive forms are the same as
the Class IV absolutive forms given above. For a more detailed discussion of gender marking
see §4.2.2.
   The root of the privative suffix, used as the stem for the addition of number suffixes, is
-baja-/-waja- (etc.). The privative suffix takes the -marnda- plural suffix (see §4.3.3.1).
   As with the proprietive suffix, there is some inconsistency in the data as to the form of the
stem to which the privative suffix is attached. For most nouns (particularly those belonging to
either Class III or Class IV) the privative suffix is attached to the citation form of the nominal,
including the gender suffix (if present). Some examples are:
   (4-179) yurula-ajama
           name.IV-PRIV.II(NOM)
           without a name (II)
   (4-180) gijîlulu-wajî
            money.IV-PRIV.I(NOM)
            without any money (I)
   (4-181) darima-aja
            plum.Ill-PRIV.IV (NOM)
            without any plums (IV)
   With other nouns, the privative suffix is attached to the root (minus the gender suffix):
   (4-182) gurij-baja                     (citation form of noun: gurija (IV))
            fat-PRIV.IV(NOM)
            without fat (IV)
   (4-183) alag-bajarna                   (citation form of noun: alaji (I) or alanga (II))
           child-PRIV.II(NOM)
           without children (H)
   (4-184) jany-bajî                      (citation form of noun: janji (1) or janya (II))
            dog-PRIV.I(NOM)
            without a dog (I)
   However, it seems that some nouns may be able to form the privative in either way. Thus
the (Class I) privative form of ilîga `sore' (IV) was given in the following two ways:
   (4-185) ilig-baji        AND îliga-aji
           sore-PRIV.I(NOM)     sore.IV-PRIV.I(NOM)
                                                                                     Nominals   99    There is also one example in the corpus in which the (Class I) privative form of janji `dog'
(I) is:
  (4-186) janji-yaji
          dogi-PRIV.I(NOM)
  Compare this with (4-184) given above.
   There are a number of similarities between the proprietive suffix and the privative suffix
with regard to the form of a particular noun that they take as their stem. Firstly, in both cases
the suffix usually attaches to the full citation form of Class IV and Class III nouns. Secondly,
both suffixes always attach to the root of the nominal alaji/alanga `child' (I/II) and can attach to
either the root or the citation form of the nominal iliga `sore' (IV). Although noteworthy, these
observations do not greatly help in arriving at an explanation for the difference in the form of
the stem with different nominals, but do suggest that the base form for adnominal inflection is
Iexically determined and that some forms (such as îliga `sore' (Iv)) are undergoing reanalysis.
In glossing, I will follow the same principle as for the proprietive suffix: where there is an
overt gender suffix on the base nominal, I will represent it in the interlinear gloss; where there
is no overt gender suffix I will not. Thus manganyma-aji `tucker.III-PRIV.I' but gunju-waji
`meat-PRIV.I'.
b) Function
   The privative suffix has two functions: the first with nominals (i), and the second with
verbs (ii).
(i) The privative suffix is used to negate the presence or existence of an entity.
   (4-187) Ngîrriy-ani        gijîlulu-waja-marndarna.
             IPL.EXC.NOM money-PRN-PL.II(NOM)
             We (women) have no money.
   (4-188) Ngarrirna             babanya         juwa-ajarna.
             t SG.POSS.II(NOM) sister.II(NOM) man-PRIV.II(NOM)
             My sister doesn't have a man/My sister is single.
   (4-189) Yarru g-a         manganyma-aji.
           go    3SG.S-PST tucker.III-PRIV.I(NOM)
           He went off without any tucker.
   A privative form can also be used to identify a person or a place:
   (4-190) Yandu ngi-n               murlu-wajanga-nka.
           wait 1SG.S(PR)-PROG eye-PRN.II-DAT
           I'm waiting for the blind woman.
   (4-191) Mirra irr-a            nguwi yaja-ni.
             sit     3PL.S-PST water-PRIV.IV-LOC
             They lived in the desert.
   As with the proprietive suffix, speakers disagree as to whether or not it is grammatically
correct for the privative suffix to occur on all words in a NP. Thus, while some speakers (e.g.
MH) consider example (4-192) to be a fully grammatical sentence, for at least one other
speaker (MG) it is impossible, a verbal clause such as (4-193) being necessary instead.
100 Chapter 4   (4-192) Alaji       buguwa-aji            darrangg u-waji.
           boy.I(NOM) big.IV-PRIV.I(NOM) stick-PRIV.I(NOM)
           The boy doesn't have a big stick.
   (4-193) Yangula gini             yabu buguwa     darranggu.
           NEG       3SG.M.A(PR) have big.IV(ACC) stick.IV(ACC)
           He doesn't have a big stick.
   However, MG does accept verbless sentences in which there is only one nominal in the
privative NP:
   (4-194) Alaji       darranggu-waji.
           boy.I(NOM) stick-PRIV.I(NOM)
           The boy doesn't have a big stick.
(ii) The privative suffix has another function in which it is used with any verb X to derive a
nominal meaning `one who cannot/does not do X'. The suffix is attached to either the root of
the verb or follows the thematic consonant (depending on the conjugation class of the verb:
see §6.1). Some examples of the use of the privative suffix in this function are:
   (4-195) Ngawurniji langan-bajarna.
           1 SG.NOM       climb-PRIV.II(NOM)

8.2.2 COORDINATE CLAUSES
   Although structurally similar, these clauses differ from those discussed above as the
relationship between the two clauses is one of coordination, rather than subordination. Thus,
these complex clauses typically correspond to those conjoined with `and', `but' and `then' in
English. In Wambaya, however, these clauses are generally juxtaposed, without any
conjunction linking them together; the one exception being clauses conjoined with ngaba,
which are discussed in §8.2.2.1 below.19
   (8-57)     Bardgu g-a       yanama         darranggu       ngarrî-yîlî-nmanji,
              fall   3SG.S-PST that.IV.SG.NOM stick.IV(NOM) ISG.OBL-COMIT-ALL
18 The discourse structure of texts in Wambaya is not well understood. Further detailed investigation is
    needed.
19 One speaker (MH) makes use of a number of other conjunctions, such as ngala `but' and gaji 'lest'.
    However, since this speaker is said to speak a dialect closer to Gudanji than Wambaya, and since these
    conjunctions are not used by other speakers, I do not include them in the discussion here. For examples
    of gaji see §7.7.2.3. An example of her use of ngala is:
       Gabi g-a           ngarlwi ngarlana            nanggarda            ngala manku gani.
       NEG 3SG.S-PST       talk     language.IV(ACC) 3SG.M.POSS.IV(ACC) BUT       hear  3SG.S(PR)
       He can't speak his own language, but he can understand (it).
      Note that Wardaman also has a particle ngala meaning 'but' (Merlan 1994).

   It is possible for the subject NP and auxiliary of the second clause to be omitted when the
subject is co-referential with the subject of the main clause:
   (8-62)    Ngaragana-nguja ngiy-a              gujinganjanga-ni jiyawu ngabulu,

   If both the subject and the object are the same, the second clause may consist of only a
verb:
20 Note the use of the nominative demonstrative here, despite the fact that the subject is ergative. There do
    not appear to be separate ergative/locative demonstratives for Classes in and iv, the nominative forms
    being used instead; see §4.6.

              Something pulled them (under the water) (and) drowned (them).
   In some examples, where the action is the same in each clause, the verb and auxiliary of
the second clause is omitted:

"
7.7.2.3 GAJI `LEST'
   Gajî is used to link two clauses with the meaning that the action described by the first
clause is carried out in order to prevent that of the second clause. This particle is found in the
speech of only one speaker (MH) and, since this speaker's dialect appears to consist primarily
33 . The use of ngaba: in this function may be an example of the pragmatic ambiguity of conjunctions
     discussed by Sweetser (1990:76ff). I am indebted to Nick Evans for this observation. Although Sweetser
     does not discuss 'so that, so then' conjunctions such as ngaba, the fact that she finds that other
     conjunctions function not only to link content items or logical premises. hut to link speech acts as well
     (as in 'Where were you last night(?), and don't give me any nonsense about staying late at the officer
     (p.112)), makes this polysemy of ngaba less surprising.
34 MH, whose dialect is closest to Gudanji, uses the particle gardaji in this construction, rather than ngaba.
210    Chapter7
of Gudanji, it is likely that gaji actually belongs to Gudanji rather than Wambaya. Examples
of this particle in the corpus include the following:
   (7-215) Corner-ni bangani ng-ala-n                     mirra gaji gini
           corner-LOC here          1SG.S-HAB.NP-PROG sit         LEST 3SG.M.A(PR)
           gajbî maga.
           eat ground.IV(ACC)
           I always sit here on the corner (of the verandah) in case he eats dirt. (i.e. so that
           she can watch her toddler grandson and prevent him from eating the dirt)
   (7-216) Ngajbi ng-u         irra     gijilulu         gaji irrî        warrawarra.

           I'm going to go see what money they've got in case they're drunk (and therefore
           spend it all).
    In the speech of the other speakers such admonitive meanings are expressed with two
separate finite clauses, with the `lest' clause marked by the presence of the hypothetical suffix
in the auxiliary. Thus:
   (7-217) Alyu        lingba-j-ba!     Ginganbi     ny-agba!
            NEG.IMP bogey-TH-FUT drown               2SG.S-HYP
            Don't swim! You might drown!","[227, 228]"
"
3.1.1.3 AUXILIARY
   The auxiliary is a fundamental constituent of Wambaya grammar. Its presence is
obligatory in every main verbal clause9 and most finite subordinate clauses. The auxiliary
contains most of the important grammatical information for the clause. It contains bound
pronouns which represent the core arguments of the clause and affixes which indicate tense,
aspect and mood. Although limited tense information is marked on the verb, that contained in
the auxiliary is usually more detailed and informative. Furthermore, there is some information
(such as habitual aspect and hypothetical mood) which is only ever marked on the auxiliary,
never on the verb. The auxiliary can also contain directional suffixes which indicate whether
the action described by the verb occurs in a direction away from or towards the speaker. The
auxiliary almost always occurs in second position in the clause. A detailed discussion of the
auxiliary and its component parts is found in Chapter 5.
   Phonologically, the auxiliary has some unusual characteristics. It is the only grammatical
word in Wambaya which can be monosyllabic, and the only word which can have a final
consonant. For the purposes of stress, a polysyllabic auxiliary constitutes a separate stress
domain, while a monosyllabic auxiliary cliticises to the preceding word and does not bear
stress (see §2.2.4).",[70]
"
3     In this respect I disagree with Blake (1990), who argues that the West Barkly languages can be reanalysed
      as prefixing on the basis of the fact that bound pronouns are prefixed in the auxiliary to what he calls a
      verbal stem (p.54). This analysis is based on examples from Chadwick (1979:681) such as the following
      from Wambaya (I have retained Blake's glosses):
         (a)   Nguba.
               I:go:FUT
               I shall go.
         (b)   Ngajbi nguba
               see        I:go:FUT
              I'll go and see.
      Blake (p.54) claims that (a) contains a verb prefixed with a bound pronoun which in (b) functions as a
      grammatical verb governing a non-finite lexical verb. According to my corpus the form in (a) is not a
      verb but the auxiliary, and can be a complete utterance only in a context where it is clearly understood
      which verb has been ellipsed. Thus, the more correk;t version of (a) would be yarru nguba in which the
      auxiliary occurs with the verb yarru meaning 'go'. The form nguba is made up of the bound pronoun
      ng(i)- representing first person singular subject, and the suffix -uba which indicates that the tense is non-
      past and the action/event involves movement in a direction away from the speaker (see below).
                                                                               The auxiliary   139  Appendix C gives the forms of the auxiliaries in the other Eastern Group languages (from
Chadwick 1978)_
5.1 BOUND PRONOUNS
   Every auxiliary (except for some directional imperative auxiliaries — see §5.3) must contain
a bound pronoun that registers the subject of the clause, and if there is a first or second
person object, then the auxiliary must also contain a bound pronoun registering the object of
the clause. (Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary. This is discussed in more
detail in §5.2.1.) The presence of bound pronouns in the auxiliary means that it is possible,
and indeed usual, to omit the overt NP if all the necessary information is included in the
bound pronoun itself, or if it is evident from context or previous discourse.
   The bound pronoun system as a whole makes a three-way distinction between transitive
subject (A), intransitive subject (S) and transitive object (0) (Table 5.1), although it is only in.
the third person singular that all three core functions are formally distinguished; all other
bound pronouns have homophonous A and S forms. While the subject bound pronouns
register person and number, object bound pronouns register person only. When the object is
non-singular, the appropriate accusative free pronoun is used to indicate the number of the
object (see below).
                     TABLE 5.1: SUBJECT AND OBJECT BOUND PRONOUNS                                           A          S          O

   Note that a gender distinction is made only in the third person transitive subject forms.
This distinction is between masculine (M), which only refers to Class I nominals, and non-
masculine (NM), which refers to nominals belonging to the feminine gender, Class II, as well
as nominals belonging to the two inanimate genders, Classes III and IV:

           stick.IV-LOC      3SG.NM.A-IO-NF scratch
           The stick scratched me.
   As mentioned above, object bound pronouns distinguish only person, not number, and are
based on the singular subject forms. When the object is singular it is enough to have just the
object bound pronoun in the auxiliary (example (5-10)). When the object is non-singular,
however, the object bound pronoun in the auxiliary must be accompanied by a noun phrase
containing the appropriate accusative free pronoun (5-11), (5-12):
140   Chapter 5
  (5-10)    Jiya-j-ba      ngu-ny-u        gijilulu.

            He hit us.
  When the object is third person non-singular it is not represented in the auxiliary (see
§5.2.1), and must be expressed by a either an accusative free pronoun (example (5-13)), a
noun-headed NP (5-14), or both (5-15), (5-16):
  (5-13)    Ngajbî ng-a        wurla.

example (5-15) and the following:

   As indicated in Table 5.1, third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary. While a
more typical analysis of the data would be to analyse the third person object morpheme to be
zero, a common situation in both Australian languages and other languages of the world, the
behaviour of auxiliaries of clauses with third person objects with respect to tense marking
indicates that they are best analysed as containing no object bound pronoun at all. The
arguments for this are given in Nordlinger (1993b) and in the discussion of tense marking in
§5.2.1.
   There are a few examples in which a plural bound pronoun is used with dual reference,
with no obvious difference in meaning. The following extract is taken from Text 1 (Appendix
A), in which other examples can also be found (e.g. lines 7-10, 14 and so on). The subject of
this extract is two boys and it begins with one of them talking to the other:

             middle-LOC 3DU.S(NP)-PROG sit
             (who) were sitting in the middle (of their camp).
   There are also examples in which a singular bound pronoun is used with general plural
reference:
  (5-19)     Bungmanyî-ni gun-u             nij-ba, nayida    g-u       gajurra.
             old.man.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-FUT sing-FUT woman.II(NOM) 3SG.S-FUT dance.FuT
             The men will sing (while) the women dance.
  However, in other examples the third person plural form irri is used with non-specific or
general reference, as is `one' or `they' in English:
  (5-20)     Ngarringga irr-a          narunguja.
             take.from 3PL.A-PST car.IV(ACC)
             They've taken (her) car. (when explaining that my car had been sent on a truck
             to Adelaide)
5.1.1 THE REFLEXIVE/RECIPROCAL PRONOUN
  In reflexive and reciprocal constructions, the reflexive/reciprocal bound pronoun (glossed
'RR') occurs in the object position in the auxiliary. The form of this bound pronoun is -ngg 4
and it is followed by regular tense/aspect/mood suffixes (see §5.2.1). Some examples are:
  (5-21)     Gurda ngiyi-ngg-a.
             be.sick 3SG.NM.A-RR-NF
             She is sick.
   (5-22)    Daguma j-ba irri-ngg-i.

             They all will fight.
   (5-23)    Daguma-j-ba wurlu-ngg-u.
             hit-TH-FUT 3DU.A-RR-FUT
             They two will fight.
  Note that, although the transitive forms of the subject bound pronouns are used in these
constructions, a subject NP takes nominative case marking, rather than ergative/locative case
marking (as would usually be expected of a transitive subject; see §4.4.3). Thus, the    Note that the Gudanji form of this pronoun is -ngga as in:
       Ngajbi wurlu-ngga-ma.
       See      3DU.A-RR-PST
       They saw each other.
    This is presumably the underlying form of the Wambaya suffix also; the tense suffix replacing the final
    vowel.
142   Chapter 5reflexive/reciprocal marker appears to detransitivise a transitive verb, as evidenced by the
subject's change in case marking.
  (5-24)    Janji       gini-ngg-a      wagardbi.
            dog.I(NOM) 3SG.M.A-RR-NF wash
            The dog is washing himself.
   (5-25)   Alag-bulu       wurlu-ngg-a nyurrunyurru.
            child-DU(NOM) 3DU.A-RR-NF chase
            The two children are chasing each other.
   This is the only situation in which there is a mismatch between transitive subject bound
pronouns and ergative/locative case marking. In all other types of constructions, a NP
represented by a transitive subject bound pronoun must have ergative/locative case marking.
   While indirect objects of verbs such as ayanî `look (for)' and yandu `wait (for)' are not
cross-referenced in the auxiliary with ordinary object bound pronouns (see example (5-3)
above), they can be cross-referenced by the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun.
   (5-26)   Ayani ngurlu-ngg-a.
            look.for IDU.EXC.A-RR-NF
            We're looking for each other.
   (5-27)   *Ayani ngî-ny-a.
              look.for 1SG.A-20-NF
            I'm looking for you.

            look.for 1 SG.S(PR) 2SG.OBL
            I'm looking for you.
   This is, therefore, one way in which indirect objects (marked with dative case) can be
distinguished from dative adjuncts: the latter cannot be cross-referenced by the
reflexive/reciprocal pronoun:
   (5-29)   *Wugbardi ngurlu-ngg-u            gunju.
             cook       1DU.EXC.A-RR-FUT meat.IV(ACC)

1   See below for two exceptions to this.
2   But see §7.1 for a discussion of clauses in which nominals function as predicates.
3   As word-class membership is not determined on semantic grounds, it is possible that either of these
    classes will contain members whose semantic characteristics do not comply with these generalisations.

                                                               Parts of speech and other preliminaries   473.1.1 INFLECTING WORD CLASSES
3.1.1.1 NOMINALS
(i) and (ii) Nouns and Adjectives
    For the most part, adjectives and nouns in Wambaya can be considered the same. In this
respect, Wambaya is typical of Australian languages, in which there is generally little formal
distinction between nouns and adjectives (Dixon 1980:272). Both nouns and adjectives are
inflected for case, number and gender, can function as the head of a noun phrase or as a
modifier qualifying the head; and can function as the predicate of a verbless clause (see §7.1).
   However, there are differences between nouns and adjectives that support the treatment of
them as two different subclasses even though they are both contained within the larger
superordinate class of nominals. These differences are semantic, morphological and
syntactic.
   Semantically, nouns typically denote objects and entities while adjectives typically denote
attributes. Furthermore, while nouns inherently belong to only one gender (or at most two, in
the case of some animate and plant nouns), an adjective has no inherent gender, but
potentially can be marked for any of the four genders in agreement with the noun that it
modifies (or in the case of an adjective functioning as the head of the phrase, in agreement
with the referent). For example:
      bugayî     alaji               big boy (I)
      bugayirna bayigina             big bag (II)
      buguwama jigama                big yam (III)
      buguwa     darranggu           big stick (IV)
   Morphologically, most of the inflectional suffixes are identical for both nouns and
adjectives. However there is at least one difference, again concerning gender: while Class IV
(the neuter gender) is generally not marked on nouns, it is marked on some adjectives by
either -a, -ga or -ja:4
Nouns:
    balamurru        spear (1V)
    wunba            wind (IV)
    barrawu          house (1v)
Adjectives:
     gurijb-a   good-Iv
     murrgun-ga three-IV
     bagi-ga    bad-Iv
     garngu-ja  many-IV
  Note that this is simply a difference in the form of the marking, not in the number of
gender possibilities for nouns and adjectives, which is exactly the same.
   The difference between the semantics of nouns and adjectives also leads to different
derivational possibilities. For example, the derivational suffix -mî, which can be attached to a
nominal X to derive a factitive verb with the meaning `cause to be X, make X' is found only
4   However with most adjectives, as with nouns, Class iv is not overtly marked (see §4.2.2).
48     Chapter 3
with adjectives, not with nouns. Thus, gurijbî `good' can become guriny-mi `make good,
make better', but a noun such as juwa `man' cannot become *juwamî `make into a man' .5
    Syntactically, while it is possible for nouns to function as modifiers of the head noun, as
in bungmaji barnanggi `old man barnanggi'6 and lagurra jurutna `deep/sunken stomach'
(literally `hole stomach'), this is relatively unusual and it is significantly more common for
adjectives to have this function.
   Thus, while there are many reasons for considering nouns and adjectives to be members
of the same superordinate word class of nominals, there is adequate justification for
considering them to be different subclasses of nominals, thereby allowing for them to behave
and be treated slightly differently with respect to certain features of the grammar.
   There is a slight structural difference for two adjectives, bagij(b)i `bad, no good (I)' and
gurijbi `good (I)', depending on whether they have a `subjective' (or experiential) meaning or
an `objective' (or evaluative) meaning. When the adjective occurs as the predicate in a
verbless construction (as in examples (3-1) and (3-3)) the meaning must be objective. If the
meaning is to be subjective, then the adjective must occur in a verbal construction, usually
with either the verb manku `hear, feel' (3-2) or the verb mirra `sit' (3-4).7
     (3-1)   Bagijbi     inî            janji.

           good:II(NOM) 1SG.S(PR)-PROG sit
           I (female) feel good.
    However, it is possible for a verbal construction, with mirra, to have an objective reading
if, for example, the verbal construction is needed for the specification of non-present tense
(see §7.1.7): .
     (3-5) Gurijbi       g-ajî       mîrra.

objective meaning.","[64, 65, 66]"

4.5.2.1 AGENTIVE NOMINALISER
  The agentive suffix is added to a verb X to derive a nominal with the meaning `one
who/which does X' or `one who does a lot of X'. It is added to either the verb root or the verb41    This is the only morphological process in the language that appears to be sensitive to discourse topic.
                                                                                  Nominais    105 root plus thematic consonant, depending on the conjugation class of the verb (see §6.1). The
agentive suffix must show gender agreement with the referent of the derived nominal and
each gender form has two phonologically conditioned allomorphs: the initial bilabial stop is
lenited to /w/ following a vowel or a lateral consonant (see §2.3.1 for a discussion of
lenition). The different absolutive gender forms of the agentive suffix are given in Table
4.12. There are no Class III forms in the corpus.
            TABLE 4.12: ABSOLUTIVE GENDER FORMS OF THE AGENTIVE SUFFIX

   The non-absolutive Class I and II forms are -barlinî-/-warlini- and -barlînga-/-warlînga-
respectively. There are no examples in the corpus of a Class IV agentive noun inflected for
case. The base form of the suffix which is used as the stem for the addition of number
suffixes is -barli-/-warli-. The agentive suffix takes the -marnda- plural suffix:
   (4-219) yugu-lumi j-barli-marndarna
            cry-CADS-TH-AGNT-PL.II(NOM)
            women who make (him) cry (re a group of drunken women who scared a baby)
  This suffix is extremely productive and common. An agentive noun has normal nominal
possibilities: it can be used as a nominal predicate (example (4-220)); as the head of a NP (4-
221) and (4-222) or as a modifier (4-223).

   An agentive nominal derived from a transitive, semitransitive or ditransitive verb can take a
dative complement expressing what would be the object in a normal verbal clause. This is
only possible when the nominal functions as a predicate. The subject in these constructions
takes the nominative case:

   Note that this dative complement is optional. It is present only if the speaker wants to
indicate specifically what the object of the action is. The two examples above could also occur
without the complement, in which case they would mean `I (always) find (things)' and `She
always gives (us) (things)', respectively.","[122, 123, 124]"

6.2.2 ADJECTIVE-TO-VERB MORPHOLOGY
6.2.2.1 INCHOATIVE SUFFIX
  The suffix -j- derives from an adjective X a verb stem with the meaning `get X, become X'.
This stem then takes the usual inflectional endings for consonant-final stems: -bi `NF' and -ba
`FUT'.
    benefactive sense, and is used in intransitive clauses to express association or accompaniment,
    sometimes with a nuance of forced accompaniment (like -(ba)bu in Wambaya) (p.49-50).
    Blake (1987:74) discusses derivational suffixes in a number of languages which advance a `possessed' NP
    to direct object. However, he does not mention anything having the anti-benefactive sense of -(ba)bu.
                                                                                    Verbs 171   (6-54)     Mambulya j-bi ng-a        nganjala           ngarli-nka.

              eat-FUT PLIMP.AWY full-INCH-FUT
              Go and eat (and) get full!
   There is one example in which this suffix appears with an adverb: jaburru `first, before'.
In this case the derived verb, jaburrajbî,13 has the meaning 'start, begin' and takes a verbal
complement inflected with the dative case.
   (6-56)     Nagarna            g-a       jaburra j-bî barla-nka.
              that.one.H.SG.NOM 3SG.S-PST first-INCH-NF fight-DAT
              The woman started to fight.
   Note that while the prototypical meaning of this suffix is inchoative, this meaning is not
always obvious and in some cases it simply means `be X':
   (6-57)    Gunyinî-nka gî            bundurrij-bi.
             other.I-DAT 3SG.S(PR) full-INCH-NF
             She's pregnant with another (child).
   Another possible analysis is that, rather than -j- being a derivational suffix, it is simply
part of a verbal root which happens to have a corresponding nominal (adjectival) root. Thus
under this analysis, a form such as bundurrî-j-bi in example (6-57) is not derived from a
nominal root bundurru meaning `full', but is actually a simple verb: bundurrij-bi `be full-NF'.
It would then be necessary to determine the relationship between the verb roots (e.g.
bundumj-) and the corresponding nominal roots (e.g. bundurru-). Further investigation is
required.
  Since the non-future form behaves like the unmarked form (as is also true for all other
verbs), I gloss it as such in examples elsewhere in this work. Thus, bundurri jbi `be full-
INCH' rather than bundurri-j-bi `be full-INCH-NF'.","[188, 189]"
"
7.4.2 SECONDARY PREDICATES
   An ascriptive NP can function as a secondary predicate (Nichols 1978) for the subject or
object of a finite clause, in which case, like all nominal modifiers, it must agree in case and
gender (and presumably number, although there are no relevant examples) with the nominal it
modifies. This secondary predicate provides information about the manner or state of the
argument during the time of the main predicate. Theoretically, since these secondary
predicates are adjuncts, any nominal could se rve as a secondary predicate co-occurring with
any verb. Examples of secondary predication follow.

          He looks after me, the sick one.
   In the following example, the secondary predicate (bugayirna ngabulungunya) is in the
nominative case, even though the clause is transitive and the subject is registered with a
transitive subject bound pronoun (and must, therefore, have ergative/locative case). This is
presumably because ergative NPs do not take ergative/locative case marking when fronted
(see §4.4.3).

          father.I(ACC)
          (When I was) grown up, having breasts, I left my father.
    True secondary predicates, such as those above, are characterised by the fact that the
clause can be seen as the conjunction of two separate predications: one without the secondary
predicate, and the other a nominal clause with the secondary predicate as the nominal
predicate. For example, (7-126) consists of the two propositions Gulugbi ga `She slept' and
Ilijbirna (nagarna) `(She) was alone'. Such constructions can thus be distinguished from the
syntactically similar use of (usually body-part) NPS in constructions of inalienable
possession. Consider the following examples:
  (7-134) Bagijbi ngi-n               juruma.
          feel.bad I SG.S(PR)-PROG stomach.iV(NOM)
          I feel sick in the stomach.
   (7-135) Warima gini-ng-a       labirra.
           hold     3SG.M.A-10-NF hand.IV(ACC)
           He held my hand.
  The modifying NP in these examples, like those functioning as secondary predicates, must
agree with the head noun in case. However, unlike example (7-126), (7-134) is not an
                                                                      Syntax of simple sentences   197example of a true secondary predicate construction since an attempt to decompose it into two
propositions would give Bagijbi ngin 'I feel sick' and the non-sensical (Ngawurniji) juruma
`I am a stomach'. A further difference between the two constructions in Wambaya is that,
while the modifying NP in secondary predicate constructions must agree with the head noun
in gender and number as well as case, this is not true for examples such as (7-134) and (7-
135) above. For example, the subject in (7-134) (taken from Text 4 in Appendix A) has
masculine gender, while the nominal juruma `stomach' has vegetable gender. Therefore,
following Evans (1995a), I distinguish between true secondary predicate constructions and
subject/object-construed body-part constructions such as those in (7-134) and (7-135)
respectively.
   A small number of verbs subcategorise for secondary predicates on the subject, in which
case the modifying NP is referred to as a subject complement. Verbs requiring subject
complements were discussed in §7.2. For convenience, one example of the reflexive verb
manku `to feel', which subcategorises for a subject complement expressing the emotion
attributed to the subject, is repeated here.
  (7-136) Manku ngi-ngg-a      baginga.
          feel      ISGA-RR-NF bad.II(NOM)
          I feel no good.","[213, 214, 215]"

29 Hale (1959:i) gives -nka as the Wambaya dative suffix, and -ngga as the Gudanji version. In my corpus
    the two appear as variants of each other, without any obvious dialectal difference.

ii) Object argument of derived nominal predicates
    The dative suffix is used to mark the object argument(s) of nominal predicates derived
from verbs with suffixes such as the agentive (4-106) and the proprietive (4-107).
   (4-106) Nanîyaga            jîya-j-barlirna           danya-nka     (ngurla).

           return(FUT) 2SG.S-NP.TWD money.IV-DAT
           You'll come back for money.
   The dative suffix can also be used with verbs to indicate purpose or intended action (see
§6.1.4 and §8.1 for a more detailed discussion of the use of the dative suffix with verbs).
   (4-110) Ngankagunyani îrri-ng-a      nyurrunyurru daguma-ji-nka.

          You'll take it for the white man.
v) `about'
   The dative case is used in Wambaya to express meanings that would be expressed in
English by the preposition `about'. In these examples the dative case is being used to indicate
the reason or cause for the action/event.
  (4-114) Didbidbunga ngirri-ngg-a-n             gijîlulu-nka bungmanya-nka.
          argue.with    IPL.EXC.A-RR-NF-PROG money.IV-DAT old.woman.II-DAT
          We're arguing with each other about the old woman's money.

          be.ashamed 1SG.A-RR-NF big.IV-DAT trousers.IV-DAT
          I'm embarrassed about his big trousers.
vi) `until'
   The dative case is used with some time nominals to express the meaning of `until':
  (4-117) Gulug-ba gurl        ngijininima-nka.
          sleep-FUT DU.IMP tomorrow-DAT
          Sleep (here) until tomorrow.
  (4-118) Yagu ng-a                marndiji-nka.
          leave 1 SG.A-PST later-DAT
          I left (it) until later.
vii) Possession
   The dative suffix is often used to indicate possession, despite the fact that there is a
separate genitive suffix (see §4.4.10). In this function, the dative suffix is affixed to the
possessor.
   (4-119) Alangi-nka yana               jalyu.
           boy.I-DAT      this.IV.SG.NOM bed.IV(NOM)
           This is the boy's bed.
   (4-120) Ngarlwi ngî         ngarringa-nka guguga-nka ngarlana.
           talk      ISG.S(PR) 1SG.POSS.II-DAT MM.II-DAT language.IV(ACC)
           I speak my grandmother's language.
   The case of the possessive phrase is marked only on the head noun; case suffixes do not
attach to the dative suffix. While this is also the case in examples such as (4-119) above, it is
demonstrated more clearly when the possessive phrase is in a non-zero-marked case:
   (4-121) Mirra ngi             gujînganjanga-mbili          alangi-nka.
           sit       1SG.S(PR) mother.II-COMIT                boy.I-DAT
           I'm sitting with the boy's mother.
90 Chapter 4   (4-122) Mirra ngi                jalyu-ni       bungmanyi-nka.
             sit     1SG.S(PR) bed.IV-LOC old.man.I-DAT
             I'm sitting on the old man's bed.
   Note that the genitive suffix is also usually not followed by case suffixes (see §4.4.10).
vii) Animate location
   The dative suffix can be used to mark animate location or goal (although the allative suffix
is more commonly used with this function; see §4.4.5).
   (4-123) Yarru ngurlu-n                 ginki garngunyi-nka.
           go     1DU.EXC.S(NP)-PROG there many.I-DAT

"
2.3 MORPHOPHONEMICS
2.3.1 LENITION
   The initial /b/ of a suffix will always lenite to /w/ when it is added to a vowel-final stem, or
to a stem ending in /rll or /rr/. Compare:
        ngaj-barlî          see-AGNT (I) BUT yugu-warli      cry-AGNT (I)
        gulug-ba            sleep-FUT    BUT ngarl-wa        talk-FUT
        jany-baji           dog-PRIV (I) BUT darranggu-waji stick-PRIV (I)
        bungmaj-bulu        old.man-DU BUT lagija-wulu       coolaman-DU
        and-bi              call.out-NF BUT ngirr-wi                    growl-NF28
   In fast or casual speech this lenition can also occur within morphemes, particularly if the
bilabial stop follows /g/, or if it is in a reduplicated syllable:
        -agba           HYP            -agwa
        wugbardi        cook         — wugwardî
        bardibardî      poor bugger — bardiwardi
   There are also a couple of examples in which /j/ lenites to /y/. This occurs in reduplications
(see §2.3.6 for a discussion of reduplication):
        junmi cut >           junmi-yunmi RDP-cut
and with the causitive suffix -jirrimi after a vowel-final stem:
        gannga+jirrimi        return+CAUS >          gannga-yirrimi
     See §6.2.1.1 for a discussion of this suffix.
     The retroflex stop /rd/ (written d word-initially) lenites to In in reduplication:
        daguma       hit > dagu-raguma            RDP-hit
This lenition is optional before /g/ intramorphemically:
        bardgu fall ~ bargu
28 It seems likely that this lenition would also occur after other liquids, given that it occurs after /rl/ and
       Irr/; however, there are no relevant examples in the corpus.
                                                                   Phonetics and phonology    392.3.2 ELISION
   When two identical vowels a re separated by a semivowel, the semivowel may be elided,
resulting in a phonetic long vowel (this process is discussed in more detail in §2.1.4 above).
This can occur both within and across morpheme boundaries.

     ngara-waji     drink-PRIV (I) > /ngara-aji/               Nap ,aiji]
     baraj-bulu     old.person-DU > /baaj-bulu/                ['baaii,bulu]
2.3.3 EPENTHESIS
   Epenthesis is one the strategies used when the concatenation of two different morphemes
results in an illicit consonan t cluster (see §2.3.5 for a full discussion). Thus, as /ni cannot
occur as the second member in a conson an t cluster (see §2.2.3 for a discussion of
permissible consonant clusters), an epenthetic vowel /ii is inserted between a consonant-final
stem and any suffix beginning with /n/. The examples in the corpus all involve verbs and the
suffixes -nka 'DAT', -nî `LOC' and -nnga `ABL' (see §6.1 for a discussion of verbal
morphology).
      mawula-j- + -nka       > mawula-j-i-nka         play-TH-EP-DAT
      gulug- + -nka          > gulug-i-nka            sleep-EP-DAT
      ngirra-j- + -nî        > ngirra j-i-ni          steal-TH-EP-LOC
      ngarl- + -ni           > ngarl-i-ni             talk-EP-LOC
      alalangmî j- + nnga    > alalangmi-j-i-nnga     hunt-TH-EP-ABL
    In examples in this work I will generally not segment this epenthetic vowel, but will group
it with the preceding morpheme (e.g. mawula-jî-nka, gulugî-nka).
   There is one example in the corpus in which lui is the epenthetic vowel. This example
involves the addition of the allative suffix -nmanji to a placename Junggurragurr `Tennant
Creek'. This placename has been borrowed from Warumungu and does not fit Wambaya
phonotactic constraints (by ending in a consonant), hence the need for an epenthetic vowel.
      Junggurragurr+ -nmanji > Junggurragurr-u-nmanji              Tennant.Creek-EP-ALL
2.3.4 ASSIMILATION
2.3.4.1 /w/ > /y/
   An intervocalic /w/ will assimilate to /y/ if it follows the high front vowel Iii. This process
affects the dual suffix -bulu/wulu and the privative suffix -baji/waji.
      /juguli-wulu/ > /juguliyulu/ rjuguli-, julu] boomerang-DU
      fuguli-waji/ > /juguliyaji/ r juguli-, jaijil boomerang-PRiv (I)
   This means that a morpheme which has an initial /b/ underlyingly can be realised with a /y/
(I will use orthography here for clarity):
      juguli + bulu > jugulî-wulu > juguli-yulu
   Thus, an initial /b/ lenites to /w/ intervocalically (see §2.3.1), and then the /w/ assimilates
to the 'frontness' and height of the preceding /i/, becoming /y/.
40     Chapter 22.3.4.2 OF STOPS BEFORE Im/
   When a root having a final stop is followed by a suffix beginning with the bilabial /m/, the
stop assimilates to a nasal. The examples of this involve the Class III gender suffix -ma and
the factitive suffix -mi:
       garnguj-     many        + -ma Class III > garngunyma many.III
       burnarîg-    wild.orange + -ma Class III > burnarîngma wild.orange.11l
       gurij-       good        + -mi FAC       > gurinymi    good.FAC
2.3.4.3 VOWEL HARMONY
   Unlike Jingili, Wambaya does not have many instances of vowel harmony. While the
process of vowel harmony in Jingili affects many nouns and most verbs (Chadwick
1975:10), systematic vowel harmony in Wambaya is only really found within the auxiliary,
although there are a couple of marginal instances restricted to specific morphemes.
  The ergative/locative suffix, usually -ni, has an allomorph -nu when the stem has final /u/.
The use of this allomorph is not obligatory; the two allomorphs are in free variation in this
environment. Some examples are:
     (2-9)   Mîrra ngurru               manjungu-nu/manjungu-ni.
             sit 1PL.INC.S(NP)          shade.IV-LOC
             We'll sit in the shade.
     (2-10) Daguma rig-a             darranggu-nu/darranggu-ni.
            hit        1SG.A-PST stick.IV-LOC
            I hit him/her/it with a stick.
The other morpheme which is affected by processes of vowel harmony is the suffix -barli
`AGNT'. The final vowel of this suffix can optionally be assimilated to /a/ with the addition of
the feminine suffix -rna .
        Daguma j-barlirna/daguma j-barlarna           hit-TH-AGNT.II     A discussion of this suffix is provided in §4.5.2.1.
   The vowel harmony in the auxiliary is triggered usually by the high vowels /u/ and /i/ and
affects any preceding high vowels. (There are no examples with preceding /a/ that would
allow us to determine whether it would also be affected by vowel harmony.)
   There are two types of vowel harmony in the Wambaya auxiliary: regressive and
progressive. Regressive vowel harmony involves the singular and the first person dual
inclusive subject bound pronouns (this set of pronouns will be termed `minimal'; see
§5.1.2). The underlying forms of these bound pronouns are as follows:29
        ngi     ISG.S/A
        nyi     2SG.S/A
        gi      3SG.S
        ginî    3SG.M.A
        ngîyi   3SG.NM.A
        mirndi 1DU.INC.S/A29 See Chapter 5 for a full discussion of the auxiliary, the bound pronouns and related affixes.
                                                                       Phonetics and phonology   41   The past tense suffix -a replaces the final vowel of the stem, but does not affect the
preceding Iii of the disyllabic stems:
      gin-a   3SG.M.A-PST
      ngîy-a  3SG.NM.A-PST
      mirnd-a I DU.INC.S/A-PST
  Nor does it affect the vowel(s) of the subject bound pronoun when it is added to an
auxiliary containing an object bound pronoun (in this case the suffix marks non-future tense):
      ngi-ny-a I SGA-20-NF
      nyi-ng-a 2SG.A-IO-NF
      gini-ng-a 3SG.M.A-10-NF
      ngiyi-ny-a 3SG.NM.A-20-NF
   However, when the future tense suffix -u is added any preceding vowels within the
auxiliary assimilate to the back vowel:
      ngu-ny-u   ISG.A-20-FUT
      nyu-ng-u   2SG.A-10-FUT
      gunu-ngg-u 3SG.M.A-RR-FUT
      nguyu-ny-u 3SG.NM.A-20-FUT
      murnd-u .  1DU:INC.S/A-FUT
   Any suffix with initial /u/ will also trigger this vowel harmony:
      ngu-ny-uda 1SG.A-20-NACT.PST
      murnd-uba I DU.INC.S/A-NP.AWY
   The habitual non-past suffix -ala provides the only example of /a/ triggering vowel
harmony:
     nga-ngg-ala     I SG.A-RR-HAB.NP
     gana-ng-ala     3SG.M.A-10-HAB.NP
     ngay-ala        3SG.NM.A-HAB.NP
   In the above examples a lu/ in a tense/aspect/mood/directional suffix triggers regressive
vowel harmony affecting the subject (and object) bound pronouns that precede it. However,
the situation concerning the non-minimal subject bound pronouns (i.e. all other non-singular
subject bound pronouns, see §5.1.2) is exactly the opposite. In the case of these bound
pronouns, it is the high vowel of the subject bound pronoun that triggers progressive vowel
harmony, affecting any high vowels in the following tense/aspect/mood/directional suffixes.
  Each of the non-minimal forms is disyllabic and has the same vowel in each syllable. The
underlying forms of the non-minimal subject bound pronouns are as follows:
     ngurlu I DU.EXC.S/A
     ngurru 1 PL.INC.S/A
     ngirri 1PL.EXC.S/A
     gurlu 2DU.S/A
     girri   2PL.S/A
     wurlu 3DU.S/A
     îrri    3PL.S/A
42    Chapter 2   Consider the following examples, in which suffixes that were triggering regressive vowel
harmony in the discussion of the minimal subject pronouns above are themselves affected by
progressive vowel harmony triggered by the vowel(s) in the non-minimal subject bound
pronoun.
    ngurlu-ny-u IDU.EXC.A-20-FUT
BUT ngirri-ny-i   1PL.EXC.A-20-FUT
    gurl-uba            2DU.S/A-NP.AWY
BUT îrr-iba             3PL.S/A-NP.AWY
    wurlu-ngg-u 3DU.A-RR-FUT
BUT girri-ngg-i 2PL.A-RR-FUT
   The habitual non-past suffix also does not trigger vowel harmony with these subjects,
although it is not affected by vowel harmony itself:
      îrr-ala      3PL.S/A-HAB.NP
      girri-ng-ala 2PL.A-1 O-HAB.NP
2.3.5 REDUCTION OF NON-PERMISSIBLE CLUSTERS
    There are three different strategies employed in Wambaya to deal with the situation in
which a morphological process creates a non-permissible consonant cluster. (i) epenthesis,
(ii) assimilation of the first consonant to the other, (iii) deletion of the final consonant of the
stem. Of these, the first two were discussed in §2.3.3 and §2.3.4.2 respectively. In this
section I discuss the cases in which the stem-final consonant is deleted.
   The deletion of the stem-final consonant is the usual strategy whenever the addition of a
suffix to a consonant-final stem results in an illicit consonant cluster.30 This is the case if the
two consonants are different:
      alag-    child      +              -ji      Class I > alaji                  boy.I
      alag-    child      +              -nga     Class II > alanga .              gir1.II
      bungmaj- old.person +              -nyi-    Class I > bungmanyi-             old.man.I
      murrgun- three      +              -ma      Class II > murrgurna             three.II
or if the two consonants are identical:
      bungmaj-      old.person +         -ji      Class I > bungmaji             old.man.I
      -gun y-       PL         +         -nya     Class II > -gunya              PL.II
   There are two examples in which a consonant-initial suffix is added to a stem with a final
consonant cluster, thereby creating a triconsonantal cluster. In both of these examples it
remains the final consonant of the stem — the middle consonant of the cluster — which is
deleted:
      wawunyg- sugarbag + -ji              Class I    > wawunji             sugarbag.i
      ginganj- drown + -bi                 Non-future > ginganbi            drown330 There are two exceptions to this: (i) when the suffix is one of -ni `LOC', -nka 'DAT' or -nnga `ABL' and
    the stem is a verb an epenthetic vowel /i/ is inserted (see §2.3.3); and (ii) when the suffix begins with
    /m/ a preceding stem-final stop assimilates to the corresponding nasal (see §2.3.4.2).

    Reduplication in Wambaya is found mainly with verbs, with which it is used to indicate
iterative or durative aspect, or the intensity of the state described by the verb (see §6.1.7). It
is also used with a few nouns, usually marking plurality (see §4.5.3). With neither of these
word classes, however, does reduplication seem to be a regular and productive process,
being relatively uncommon and found only with a limited number of forms. Although
Wambaya is a suffixing language, reduplication generally occurs to the left; that is, the
reduplicated element is attached as a prefix. There are two main patterns of reduplication in
Wambaya, found with both verbs and nouns. At this stage of the investigation, it is not clear
what determines which reduplication pattern a particular form will follow: there are no
obvious phonological or morphological properties which characterise the two classes of
roots. Clearly, more research is required.
   The most common reduplication pattern copies (to the left) the first two syllables of the
word (or the whole word if disyllabic). In the following examples, syllable boundaries are
indicated by a period.32
     ngaj.bi             see              > ngaj.bi-ngaj.bi                        look around
     la ja:rri           light fire       > la ja-la ja.rri                        light fire (DUR)
     ngun.ju.lu          carry            > ngun.ju-ngun.ju.lu                     carry (DUR)
     nya.gaj.bi          be tired         > nya.ga-nya.gaj.bi                      be very tired33
     lung.gany.mi        make cheeky      > lung.gu34-lung.gany.mi                 make very cheeky
     la.barn.ga          branch (of tree) > la.ba-rla.barn.ga                      branch (of tree)
   If the first and second syllables of the word are identical, then only one syllable is copied:
       nya.nya.yu move around > nya-nya.nya.yu move around repeatedly
       di.di.ja   carry       > dî-dî.dî.ja    carry (DUR)
   If the word has an initial stop, this will often lenite to a glide in reduplicated forms. Thus,
/rd/ (written d initially) lenites to Id, r/ lenites to /y/ and /b/ lenites to /w/. There are no
examples of lenition of the velar stop /g/.
       da.gu.ma hit                  >              da.gu.-ra.gu.ma          keep hitting
       du.rra   be   frightened (of) >              du.rra.-ru.rra           be very frightened
       jun.mi   cut                  >              jun.mi.-yun.mi           keep cutting
       bard.gu  fall                 >              bard.gu.-ward.gu         keep falling
   The second main reduplication pattern in Wambaya is slightly more interesting as the
reduplicated part at first appears to be infixed, and does not constitute a single prosodic unit,
31 It is interesting that it is the alveolar nasal, rather than the palatal nasal, which appears in this form.
    This suggests that it is the alveolar nasal that is present before the palatal stop in the root (usually only
    the palatal nasal occurs in this position).
32 The glosses for the reduplicated forms given here are those that the form had in the context in which it
    was given. It is possible that a form may also have other meanings in other contexts. For example,
    lajalajarri may be able to have both a durative meaning such as 'spend some time lighting a fire' and an
    iterative meaning such as 'light many fires'.
33 Note that in this example, as in the two following, it appears that the final consonant of the second
    syllable has not been copied in the reduplicand. However, since in all cases this would result in an illicit
    consonant cluster, meaning that this consonant would be deleted (see §2.3.5), it is not possible to tell
    whether it has simply been copied and then deleted, or not copied at all.
34 Note that this vowel seems to have assimilated to those on either side of it.
44      Chapter 2
consisting of the rhyme of the first syllable and the onset of the second. This type of
reduplication process has been noted in other Australian languages, such as Warumungu
(Simpson 1992), Mangarayi (Merlan 1982) and Jingili (Chadwick 1975). Some examples of
this type of reduplication are:
        banymi      pass by        > banymanymî         keep passing by
        angbardi    build          > angbangbardi       build repeatedly
        bundurrijbî get full       > bundundurrijbi     get very full
        bungmaji    old man        > bungtnungmajî      old men
   Following accounts by McCarthy and Prince (1986:47) for Mangarayi we can account for
this reduplication process in the following way.
     (i) The initial consonant of the base word is considered extramelodic (i.e. it is detached
         from the base but is still available for copying).
 (ii) Attach the template of one syllable as a prefix to the base.
 (iii) Given a copy of the base, satisfy the syllable to the fullest.
 (iv) According to the universal Onset Rule, copy the initial consonant of the second syllable
      of the base as the onset of the second syllable of the reduplicated form.
  Thus, if we apply this account to the Wambaya examples, the derivation of a form such as
banymanymi is as follows:
           6        a
        (b)any mi                        A
               (b)any mi
        banymî      (b)any mî
iv. a            + 6           a
        banymi (b)any mi
   In a form such as angbardi there is no initial consonant to be extramelodic, but the rest of
the derivation remains the same:
i.        a a       a        ang ba rdi
                                                                    Phonetics and phonology   45ii.      a+       a                 a
                  g       La rî                 ,‘ u
        angbardi wig ba rdi
iv.       a+          a
        angbardi ang ba rdi
      In one Wambaya form, the template appears to be two syllables, rather than one syllable:
        garriji   `be cold' >       gamjarriji
i.      a a a         \N N
        (g)a m fl
ii.     a a + a a a                               N.   N           if         (g)a      m jt
        gamji (g)a ni ji
iv. a a + a a a        1\4-'1 N N
     gamft (g)a m Jt
  Although these two reduplication patterns account for most of the reduplicated forms in
Wambaya, there are a few other forms which are reduplicated in slightly different ways. In a
couple of examples the reduplicated form is derived by copying the last two syllables of the
word to the right:
        ya.rru.bu.rdu        walk around > ya.rru.bu.rdu-bu.rdu   keep walking around
        garr.ga.lyi          plains lizard > garr.ga.lyî-ga.lyî   plains lizard
Some other reduplicated forms (of nouns) appear to be unpredictable:
        alaji    boy > alajaji          boys
        iligirra river > ililirri       rivers
                                              CHAPTER 3              PARTS OF SPEECH AND OTHER PRELIMINARIES3.1 PARTS OF SPEECH
   There are seven parts of speech (or `word classes') in Wambaya, determined by the
inflectional and distributional characteristics of each word. These classes are mutually
exclusive:1 each root belongs to only one word class, although with the use of derivational
suffixes, it is possible for a root to move its membership from one word class to another.
These derivational suffixes are discussed in §4.5.2 (verb to nominal) and §6.2.2 (nominal to
verb). The seven parts of speech in Wambaya are:
     (1)     NOMINALS
               (i) nouns
              (ii) adjectives
             (iii) free pronouns
             (iv) demonstratives
              (v) locational nominals
             (vi) temporal nominals
            (vii) indefinite/interrogatives
      (2)    VERBS
      (3)    AUXILIARY
      (4)    ADVERBS
      (5)    PARTICLES
      (6)    CLITICS
      (7)    INTERJECTIONS
   Of these seven word classes, the two largest and most important are the open classes of
verbs and nominals. These two classes have quite distinct morphological and syntactic
characteristics. Nominals generally inflect for gender, number and case and usually function
as the arguments of the clause.2 Verbs on the other hand are inflected for tense, co-occur with
the auxiliary and typically function as the predicate of the clause. Both classes also have
different derivational possibilities. Although word-class membership is determined primarily
on grammatical and functional grounds such as these, it is also possible to characterise the
difference between these two word classes on semantic grounds: verbs typically describe
states, actions and events, and nominals usually denote entities, objects and attributes.3
   In the following discussion I divide the word classes into `inflecting' (nominals, verbs and
the auxiliary) and `non-inflecting' (adverbs, particles, clitics and interjections).","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]"

31 The suffix -mbili in Jingili is used to mark both locative and comitative case functions (see Chadwick
     1975:20).
                                                                                          Nominals   934.4.10 GENITIVE SUFFIX
   The genitive suffix, along with the proprietive (§4.4.11), the privative (§4.4.12) and the
origin (§4.4.13) suffixes, is different from the case suffixes discussed above in that it
functions adnominally, relating one NP to another within one constituent. In contrast, the case
suffixes discussed above function to indicate the role of a NP within a simple clause and
therefore have a relational function (Dench and Evans 1988:2). Formally these suffixes differ
from other case suffixes in that they are inflected for gender and (except for the genitive) can
themselves be inflected for case.
   The genitive suffix marks the possessor of a possessive NP and agrees in gender with the
possessed (head) noun. More commonly the dative suffix is used to mark possession (see
§4.4.4), and there are thus only a limited number of examples of the genitive suffix in the
corpus. Almost all of these examples have Class Iv agreement, but there are a few with Class
I and Class II agreement. The regular forms of the genitive suffix are nîganji (I), niganya (II)
and niganka (IV);32 irregular allomorphs are found with kinship nouns and are discussed
below. The first vowel of the regular suffix assimilates to the preceding vowel of the stem,
giving the alternative forms nuganka and naganka. The genitive suffix is attached to the non-
absolutive gender form of the noun. Some examples are:
   (4-146) Nayidanga-nî guyala nguy-udi                  ngajbi, juwa-nîganka.
           woman.II-LOC NEG       3SG.NM.A-NACT.PR see           man.I-GEN.IV
           Women can't see (the dance), (it) belongs to men.
   (4-147) Yana            balamurru       bungmanyi-nîganka.
           this.IV.SG.NOM spear.IV(NOM) old.man.I-GEN.IV
           This spear belongs to the old man.
   (4-148) murlu-nuganka mijangga
           eye.IV-GEN.IV medicine.IV(NOM)
           eye medicine
  The case suffix of the possessive phrase appears only on the head noun (i.e. on the
possessed noun); there is no case marking that follows the regular genitive suffi x. This is true
whether the head noun precedes or follows the genitive noun. Some examples of genitive
phrases with non-zero case suffixes are:
   (4-149) Yarru ngi          bungmanya-naganka magi-nmanji.
           go     ISG.S(PR) old.woman.II-GEN.IV camp.IV-ALL
           I'm going to the old woman's camp.
   (4-150) Ayani ngi             magi-nka     bungmanya-naganka.
           look.for ISG.S(PR) camp.IV-DAT old.woman.II-GEN.IV
           I'm looking for the old woman's camp.
   However, speakers will accept as grammatical examples in which both the possessed noun
and the genitive noun are inflected for case, although they do not produce such examples
themselves:
   (4-151) Mina ngi            alangi-niganka-ni                  jalyu-ni.
           sit      ISG.S(PR) boy.I-GEN.IV-LOC                    bed.IV-LOC
           I'm sitting on the boy's bed.","[110, 111]"

8.2.1.2 ADJOINED CLAUSES AS NP MODIFIERS
   Adjoined clauses can also function adnominally, modifying a main clause NP. In this
function the modifying clause follows the NP which it modifies. In the examples in the
corpus, the adjoined clause modifies either the direct object (examples (8-39), (8-40)), an
oblique object (8-41) or one of the NPs of a verbless clause (8-38). There are no examples in
which the subject of a verbal clause is modified by a finite clause. The modified NP can have
either subject function ((8-39), (8-40), (8-41)) or object function (8-38) in the relative
clause.1616 This adnominal function can often be perfomed by a verb inflected with either the agentive or the
    privative suffix (both of which can derive a nominal from a verb). The difference between this type of
    relative clause and that which is expressed with a finite clause is that in this type the relative clause
    expresses a general characteristic rather than a specific action or event: 'he who is a fighter', rather than
    'he who is fighting'. A couple of examples are:
      (i) Dunn              ngi-n            marawunjini-nka dawu j-barlini-nka.

   Note that example (8-39), in a different context, could be a causal adjunct to the main
clause meaning `I'm going to hit the dog because it bit me'.
   In all of the examples above, the modifying finite clause is syntactically distinct from the
head NP, as evidenced by the fact that it constitutes a separate domain for the purposes of
auxiliary placement. However, a more common situation is for the head NP to immediately
precede the auxiliary of the modifying clause, thereby indicating that the NP and the finite
clause together form a complex NP. It is not yet known what semantic difference, if any,
exists between this type of construction and that exemplified in examples (8-38) to (8-41)
above.

   Adjoined clauses can function as clausal arguments of main clause verbs of speech or
perception such as îlinga 'hear, remember SCOMP', didima `tell (0) that SCOMP' and janganja
or bajiya `ask (0) (if) SCOMP'. In these constructions the subordinate clause always follows
the main clause. An example is:
   (8-47) Guyala ng-udi                ilinga      [injani g-a          yarru].
             NEG       ISG.A-NACT.PR remember where 3SG.S-PST go
             I can't remember where he went.
   With speech verbs the argument clause is usually an indirect speech quotation in which the
speaker paraphrases the utterance being reported (examples (8-48), (8-49)). When it is the
argument of janganja or bajiya, both of which mean `ask', the finite clause is usually
translated with a concealed question ((8-50), (8-51)).

   Often the clausal argument of a speech verb is direct quoted speech. In this case, the
speech is reported with all of the deïctic categories (i.e. person, tense, etc.) having as their
reference the speech situation being referred to, rather than that of the present:

   A particularly common construction for quoting speech in story-telling involves the verb
ngajbi `see', which in this construction takes the finite clause as an argument. This
construction is used when the speaker is reporting an observation made (either in speech or in
thought) by one of the story's characters, and appears to play an important role in the
progression of the story by setting the scene for the next event. is It is difficult to translate this
construction into English; a close approximation might be `X looked/noticed and said Y' or
even, `X noticed that Y', without any direct speech (example (8-54)). There are many
examples in the texts in Appendix A; some selected examples follow.

"3.1.1.2 VERBS
   Most of the information that is traditionally associated with verbs, such as tense, aspect
and mood, is found in the auxiliary in Wambaya. Verbs themselves have comparatively few
inflectional possibilities. In main clauses verbs make a `future'/`non-future' (or unmarked)
distinction with the future form also used in imperative constructions. The inflectional
possibilities for verbs are discussed in §6.1. In non-finite subordinate clauses verbs are
inflected with either the infinitive suffix -barda; or one of three nominal suffixes — the
ergative/locative -nî, the ablative -nnga or the dative -nka — which indicate, respectively,
whether the action described in the subordinate clause occurs concurrently, occurred
previously, or will follow that of the main clause. The use of these suffixes with verbs is
discussed in detail in §6.1 and §8.1. There is also a reduplication process which provides
some aspectual information (see §6.1.7). There are many derivational possibilities for verbs.
Verbs can be made into transitive verbs; causative verbs; and various types of nouns, both
                                                        Parts of speech and other preliminaries   51agentive and instrumental. The verb-to-verb derivational processes are discussed in §6.2.1,
and the verb-to-nominal processes in §4.5.2.
    Verbs in main clauses must always be accompanied by an auxiliary, which registers the
main arguments of the clause and often provides the only tense and aspect information. This
is in contrast with nominal predicates, which obligatorily occur without the auxiliary. There is
a tendency for verbs to occur in initial position in the clause: a survey of texts showed that
61% of verbal clauses were verb-initial.
   There is a group of verbs which, although clearly verbs in their own right, have another
function as adverbs, modifying the main verb in the clause. This is one case in which the
mutual exclusivity of word-class membership appears to be violated. The most common
examples of this type of construction involve the verbs gurinymi `make good' and ganjîmi
`finish', which can be used as modifiers meaning `well, properly' and `all' respectively. In
these constructions it is only the main verb that takes the tense inflection; the modifying verb
remains unmarked for tense. Some examples of these verbs functioning as adverbs, and also
as verbs, are:
  (3-9) a. Gunny-mi ng-u      gulug-ba.
           good-FAC 1SG.S-FUT sleep-FUT
           I will sleep well.
          b. Gunny-ma       ng-u.
             good-FAC.FUT 1SG.A-FUT
             I will fix it.
  (3-10) a. Gaj-ba gun-u        ganjimi.
            eat-FUT 3SG.M.A-FUT finish
            He will eat it all.
          b. Ganjima gun-u.
             finish.FUT 3SG.M.A-FUT
             He'll finish it.
   Examples of this type of construction with other modifying verbs include:
  (3-11) Barngala           ngi-n          mîrra.
         have.legs.crossed 1SG.S(PR)-PROG sit
         I'm sitting with my legs crossed.
  (3-12) Jirrbali        gî-n           nanîyaga      gulugbî.
         lie.on.stomach 3SG.S(PR)-PROG that.II.SG.NOM sleep
         She's sleeping on her stomach.
   The following examples demonstrate that these modifiers are verbs as well, since they are
capable of taking the future tense inflection and appearing alone without another verb:
   (3-13) Barngali-j-ba              giliyaga!
          have.crossed.legs-TH-FUT there
          Sit down with your legs crossed over there!
   (3-14) Jirrbali-j-ba!
          lie.on. stomach-TH-FUT
          Lie on your stomach!
52     Chapter 3   There is only one form that has doubtful status as a verb. This form, darridarri `be in a
line', is only ever found in the modifying function. It was not possible to get an example of
darrîdarri occurring alone.
     (3-15) Darridarri irri-n           mîrra.
            be.in.a.line 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sit
            They're sitting in a line.
     (3-16) Darrîdarri gîrr     garran-ba!
            be.in.a.line PL.IMP stand-FUT
            Stand in a line!
   However, rather than place darridarri in a word class of its own, I will consider it part of
the verb word class by analogy with other modifying verbs such as those in examples (3-11)
and (3-12) above.
     For a more detailed discussion of clauses containing two verbs see §7.4.1.","[68, 69, 70]"

4.4.11 PROPRIETIVE SUFFIX
    The proprietive suffix is used to indicate that one noun `has' another. Its use in Wambaya
is rather restricted and, although it is occasionally used to indicate alienable possession (as in
`I have a spear'), it is most frequently used to indicate the physical characteristics of a person
(e.g. `She is pregnant'), an object (e.g. `tea with milk') or a place (e.g. `place with trees').
a) Form
   The proprietive suffix agrees in gender with the noun that it modifies:
   (4-155) alajî          darranggu-nguji
            boy.I(NOM) stick-PROP.I(NOM)
            a boy with (a) stick
   (4-156) alanga         darranggu-ngunya
           girl.II(NOM) stick-PROP.II(NOM)
           a girl with (a) stick
   (4-157) maga              darranggu-nguja
            camp.IV(NOM) tree-PROP.IV(NOM)
            a camp with trees
   The absolutive and non-absolutive forms for each gender are given in Table 4.10. The
gender marking with the proprietive suffix is regular for nominals (see §4.2.2) and the
different gender forms are all derivable from the root -nguj-. A noun with the proprietive
suffix must also agree with the case (example (4-158)) and number (4-159) of the noun or
referent that it modifies.
                                                                                       Nominals     95               TABLE 4.10: THE GENDER FORMS OF THE PROPRIETIVE SUFFIX                                    Absolutive form       Non-Absolutive form
                     Class I           -nguji                -ngunyi-
                     Class II          -ngunya               -ngunya-
                     Class III         -ngunyma              -ngunymi- (?)
                     Class IV          -nguja                 nguji-
   Number suffixes are added to the root, -nguj-. The proprietive suffix takes the -baia plural
suffix (see §4.3.3.1).
   Some examples of the proprietive suffix co-occuring with other suffixes are:
  (4-158) Wurrudbanyi ngiy-a                    maganja                   murlu-ngunya-ni.
            pull              3SG.NM.A-PST digging.stick.1V(ACC) eye-PROP.II-LOC
            The one that could see got the yam stick.
   (4-159) Nanawulu              nayîda-wulu         gijîlulu-nguj-bulu.
            this.H.DUNOM woman-DU(NOM) money-PROP-DU(NOM)
            These two women have money.
   (4-160) Ngirriyani            manganyma-nguj-balarna.
            I PL.EXC.NOM tucker.HI-PROP-PL.II(NOM)
            We've got tucker.
  There is some inconsistency in the corpus as to the form of the noun to which the
proprietive suffix is affixed. The usual case is simply to add it to the full citation form of the
noun (including the gender suffix). Thus:
   (4-161) manganyma-nguja
            tucker. II-PROP.IV (NOM)
           tucker-having (Iv)
   (4-162) janjî-ngunya33
            dog.I-PROP.II(NOM)
            dog-having (II)
   However, in other examples it seems that the proprietive suffix is added to a nominal root.
In these examples the root ends in /g/ and the initial consonant of the suffix is omitted:
   (4-163) alag-unya                   (citation form of noun: alaji (I) or alanga (II))
           child-PROP.II(NOM)
           pregnant (1)
   (4-164) garlangg-uja                (citation form of noun: garlangga (IV))
             sand-PROP.IV(NOM)
             sand-having (IV)
  For some nouns either alternative is possible. For example, the proprietive form of
marnarrga `mud' (IV) (here with Class II agreement) was given in two different ways:33 It would be interesting to see whether this form would contrast with a form janya-ngunya `dog.tt-
    PROP.n(NOt )' , in which the dog is marked as female and not male. This is something that needs to be
    checked in the field.
96     Chapter 4
     (4-165) mamarrga-ngunya            AND     marnarrg-unya
             mud.IV-PROP.II(NOM)                mud-PROP.II(NOM)
   Similarly, there are two different ways in which the nouns iliga `sore' (Iv) and wawunjî
`sugarbag' (I) can be inflected with the proprietive suffix:
     (4-166) iliga-nguji                AND      ilig-uji
             sore.I V-PROP.I(NOM)                sore-PROP.I(NOM)
             sore-having (I)
     (4-167) wawunjî-nguja            AND        wawunyg-uja
             sugar.bag.I-PROP.IV(NOM)            sugar.bag-PROP.IV(NOM)
             sugar bag-having (IV)
   If a noun retains an overt gender suffix (example (4-161)) I will represent it in the
interlinear glosses. If there is no overt gender suffix, however, I will not represent the gender
of the `base' noun in the gloss. For example, janji-ngunya will be glossed `dog.I-PROP.II' but
darranggu-ngunya will just be glossed `stick-PROP.II'.
b) Function
   The most common use of the proprietive suffix is to express a physical characteristic or
state of a person (examples (4-168) and (4-169)), an object (4-170) and (4-71) or a place (4
172).
     (4-168) Ilarra-wulu:      gunyama        murlu-ngunya     gunyarna
             eaglehawk-DU(NOM) other.II(NOM) eye-PROP.II(NOM) other.II(NOM)

             stone-PROP.IV(NOM) country.IV(NOM)
             (It's) stony country.
     Another use of the proprietive suffix is to express alienable possession:
     (4-173) Yandu ngi-n               bungmanya-nka   gijilulu-ngunya-nka.
             wait     ISG.S(PR)-PROG old.woman.II-DAT money-PROP.II-DAT
             I'm waiting for the old woman with money.
     (4-174) Ngajbi ng-a          buguwa          narunguja garlangg-uja.
             see      ISG.A-PST big.IV(ACC) car.IV(ACC) sand-PROP.IV(ACC)
             I saw a big truck with sand (in it).
                                                                                          Nominals     97  The proprietive suffix can also be used to express accompaniment:
  (4-175) Bungmaji         iniyaga        g-uba     yarru balamurru-nguji.
          old.mani(NOM) that.I.SG.NOM 3SG.S-NP.AWY go(FUT) spear-PROP.I(NOM)
          That old man will go with a spear.
   Interestingly, some speakers restrict the proprietive suffix to having word scope, and
others use it with phrasal scope, marking the proprietive on all words of the NP. Thus, some
speakers (e.g. MH) considered the following examples to be perfectly grammatical (although
there are no such spontaneous examples in the corpus):
  (4-176) Alaji        buguwa-nguji      darranggu-nguji.
          boy.l(NOM) big.IV-PROP.I(NOM) stick-PROP.I(NOM)`
          The boy has a big stick.
   (4-177) Yarru ng-a         bayigi-ngunya ngarrirna-ngunya.
           go      1SG.S-PST bag-PROP.II(NOM) 1SG.POSS.II-PROP.II(NOM)
           I went (taking) my bag.
   However, one speaker in particular (MG) felt that they were completely ungrammatical and
that it was necessary to use a verbal clause instead, such as the following:34
   (4-178) Yabu gini-n                  buguwa        darranggu.
             have   3SG.M.A(PR)-PROG    big.IV(ACC)   stick.IV(ACC)
             He has a big stick.
   Note that Dench and Evans (1988) give phrasal scope as an essential characteristic of case
suffixes, as opposed to derivational suffixes. As the proprietive suffix can have phrasal scope
for some speakers it considered for present purposes to meet this criterion for casehood.
However, further investigation is required.","[112, 113, 114, 115]"

1.1.2 WIDER RELATIONSHIPS
   As they are among the southernmost non-Pama-Nyungan languages, the West Barkly
languages are surrounded on two sides by Pama-Nyungan languages to which they are
clearly not genetically related: Wagaya and Warumungu in the south and the Ngumpin
languages in the west. Although the non-Pama-Nyungan languages Alawa and Wardaman are
adjacent to the West Barkly languages to the north, there is no apparent genetic relationship
with these languages either. Nor is there any obvious genetic relationship between the West
Barkly languages and Garrwa and Waanyi which lie immediately to the east; although striking
similarities in verbal inflections (see §6.1) suggest a history of contact and influence between
these two language groups (see also I. Green 1995). Thus, the West Barkly languages are
not (closely) related to any of the languages that border them.
   Dixon (1980:225) claimed Jingili (and by implication all of the West Barkly languages) to
be one of two languages (the other being Tiwi) which could not be genetically linked to other
Australian languages at all. However, comparative work done by Chadwick (e.g. 1984) has
shown that the West Barkly languages are related to the Jaminjungan languages (Jaminjung
(Cleverly 1968), Ngaliwuru (Bolt et al. 197la) and Nungali (Bolt et al. 197lb)), located in
the west of the Northern Territory, towards the West Australian border9 (see Map 1). This
relationship is interesting as the West Barkly languages and the Jaminjungan languages are
physically non-contiguous; they are geographically separated by the Ngumpin languages.
   There is (at least) one major typological difference between the Jaminjungan languages and
the West Barkly languages: the West Barkly languages are `suffixing' (employing suffixes
rather than prefixes) and the Jaminjungan languages are `prefixing' (employing both suffixes
and prefixes). However, many of the prefixes found in the Jaminjungan languages
correspond with suffixes in languages of the West Barkly group (see Appendix B). The
existence of residual prefixes in certain lexical items and grammatical elements in West Barkly
languages (such as the gender prefixes in Wambaya demonstratives and the pronominal
elements in the auxiliary), which correspond to prefixes found in Jaminjungan languages is
strong evidence that the West Barkly languages were originally prefixing and have since
become suffixing (see I. Green 1995 for detailed discussion).
   The most striking similarities between the Jaminjungan and the West Barkly languages, as
identified by Chadwick (e.g.1984), are found among the pronouns (both bound and free) and
the gender affixes (at least in Nungali, the only Jaminjungan language with a gender
system). l
°   The similarities, at least within the dialects of the McArthur language, are such that it can generally be
    assumed that much of what is said for Wambaya will be at least similar if not the same for Binhinka and
    Gudanji. The only major areas of difference between these dialects are the auxiliary (particularly the
    tense/aspect/mood marking) and the forms of the demonstratives (see Appendix C and §4.6 respectively).
    This group of languages, containing the West Barkly and Jaminjungan languages, is known as the
    Mirndi group after their shared innovative first person dual inclusive pronouns.
10 The following discussion is based on information contained in Chadwick (1978, 1979 and 1984).
                                                                 The language and its speakers   Among the pronouns there is a large degree of similarity in the function and form of
regular pronouns, as well as irregularities in the system which are common to all of the
languages. One example of this is the first person dual inclusive pronoun which has a base of
the form mind(i) or mirnd(î) in all the languages, and has been adopted as the name for the
whole group. Examples of other similarities among free pronouns include the form of second
person singular free pronouns:
     nanti            Jaminjung and Ngaliwuru
     naminju          Nungali
     nanuthiyama      Jingili
     nyami            Gudanji and Binbinka
     nyamirniji       Wambaya
and the form of the suffix that occurs on dual and plural non-subject free pronouns:
     -ag       Jaminjung           (e.g. mindag IDU.INC.OBL)
     -agu      Jingili             (e.g. mîndagu IDUJNC.OBL)
     -(a)ga    Ngarnga and Gudanji (e.g. mîrndaga IDU.INC.OBL)
  Among the bound pronouns, an example of similarity is the third person singular
masculine transitive subject forms:
     gan-     Jaminjung an d Ngaliwuru (used for feminine too)
     ngan-    Nungali
     gani-    Gudanji (present tense)
     gînî-    Wambaya
   A significant degree of similarity also exists between Nungali and the West Barkly
languages in the area of gender and gender marking. All of these languages have four
genders, marked by suffix in the West Barkly languages, and by prefix in Nungali. In all
languages there is a distinction made among gender affixes according to case. In the Eastern
Group of the West Barkly languages this is a two-way distinction between absolutive gender
affixes which appear in the nominative and accusative cases, and those which appear in all
other cases, followed by regular nominal case suffixes. In Jingili and Nungali, however,
there is a three-way distinction among gender suffixes: absolutive, ergative and dative.
Unlike in Wambaya, the ergative an d dative gender suffixes in Jingili and Nungali are not
supplemented with regular nominal case affixes. There is a significant degree of
correspondence in both form and function between the gender suffixes of Nungali and the
West Barkly languages. This is discussed in Appendix B.","[22, 23]"

4.9 NP STRUCTURE
   A Wambaya noun phrase consists of a head and one or more modifiers, all of which are
optional (the head can be ellipsed when it is recoverable from previous discourse; see below).
All members of the NP must agree in terms of gender, number and case (where
morphologically possible). As is common to several Australian languages, elements of NPs in
Wambaya need not be contiguous in the clause. This possibility of discontinuous NP
constituents has led researchers working on some Australian languages (e.g. Heath 1986 on
Nunggubuyu, Blake 1983 on Kalkatungu) to suggest that these languages may not have NP
                                                                                                Nominals      131constituents, and that apparent NPS can just be treated as apposed nominals. I will not review
the arguments for this analysis here, but assume that the following two pieces of evidence
argue for the existence of a NP constituent in Wambaya, at least in those cases in which the
elements are contiguous (see below for more discussion of discontinuous NPs):
     (i) Usually the auxiliary must follow the initial word of a clause. However, it is possible
         for the auxiliary to follow a complex NP, thereby providing evidence for its existence
         as a constituent_ The position of the auxiliary can then be described as being after the
         initial constituent of a clause.
     (ii) In possessive phrases in which the possessor is marked with either genitive or dative
          case, relational case marking is found only on the head of the NP. As relational case
          marking is not found on the possessor nominal in this situation, the case marking
          found on the head nominal also refers to the modifying nominal, thereby providing
          evidence that the two nominals in such phrases form a single NP constituent.
   The structure of a Wambaya NP is as follows.78 Note that any one of the modifers listed in
the position before the head can be postposed to follow the head.79
       (MODIFIERS)                       (HEAD) (MODIFIER)
       (Dem)(POSS)(Num)(Adj) Nom
       Dem = Demonstrative
       POSS = Possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or possessive NP
       Num = Numeral
       Adj = Adjective
       Nom = Nominal
  The head is usually filled by a noun, but can in principle be any type of nominal. An
example from Text 1 in Appendix A in which a numeral functions as the head is:
     (4-301) Garnguji=miji                in-i-n                mirra.
               many.I(NOM~INFER 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sit
               There must be a big group (of people).
   The fact that this example occurs at the beginning of the text (i.e. the second line) before
there has been any mention of people, suggests that the numeral is functioning as the head,
rather than simply modifying an ellipsed head. However, there are a small number of
examples in which it may be argued that the head has been ellipsed. Consider the following
sequence (lines 62-64) from the same text:S0
78    This is the same structure as in Kayardild (Evans 1995a) and is very similar to the Gooniyandi structure
      (McGregor 19%).
79    In his detailed discussion of Gooniyandi noun phrases, McGregor (1990) makes a distinction between
      reference modification and referent modification, and shows that this distinction correlates with a contrast
      in function between pre-head and post-head modifiers. Thus, an element which precedes the head modifies
      the reference of the head nominal, it selects a subset of the potential referents denoted by the nominal. In
      contrast. a post-head constituent modifies the head's referent, indicating a quality of property of the thing
      itself, which may be independent of the nominal denoting the entity (p. 26711). Further research is needed
      to determine whether there is likewise a semantic difference between pre- and post- head modifiers in
      Wambaya.
80    This discussion has benefited greatly from McGregor's (1990) discussion of NPs in Gooniyandi,
132   Chapter4   (4-302) Bungmaj-buli-ji     ngankawuliji wurl-aji               daguma juwarramba.

            many.i(ACC) 3DU.A-HAB.PST hit
            They'd been killing a lot of them.
  In this example, in contrast to that given in (4-301), garnguji in the final line appears to be
modifying the ellipsed head juwarramba which is mentioned in the preceding two clauses.
Thus, this is one example in which an NP has no overt constituent corresponding to its head.
   A NP can also be made up of a pronoun. A (non-possessive) pronoun is always the head
of a phrase, and usually occurs alone (although see below for some possible exceptions to
this).
   Some example NPs are:

          wait     ISG.S(PR) 3SG.F.OBL
          I'm waiting for her.
   Although the tendency is for NPs to be contiguous, it is possible for members of a NP to be
separated in the clause. In the majority of these examples, one element of the discontinuous
NP appears initially in the clause (see examples (4-312)-(4-314)), but this is not always the
case (see (4-315)).
  Examples of discontinuous NPs are:
  (4-312) Garngunya gin-aji                yabu garirda-rdarra       garndawugini-ni.
          manylRACC) 3SG.M.A-HAB.PST have wife.Il-GROUP(ACC) one.i-LOC

           Sister you're making lots of dust for us.
   A great deal more work is needed on discontinuous constituents in Wambaya and the
discourse conditions under which they are possible.                    .
  A small set of nouns can also be used as modifiers, modifying a head noun. The most
common examples of this involve the noun bungmajî `old man' (1):
   (4-316) Garidi-ni      bungmanyi-ni gin-amany     yanybi.
           husband.I-LOC old.man.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-P.TWD get
           (Her) old man husband came and got (her).

           ISG.POSS.I(NOM) old.man.I(NOM) MB.I(NOM) 3SG.S-PST go
           mawula-ji-nka.
           play-TH-DAT
           My old man uncle came to play (cards).
134     Chapter 4   Another example involves the noun lagurra `hole'. Note that despite the fact that it belongs
to a different gender, lagurra shows no gender agreement with the head noun in this example:
     (4-318) Yabu ng-aji             lagurra        juruma.
             have 1SG.A-HAB.PST hole.IV(ACC) stomach.IIl(ACC)
             I used to have a deep stomach (i.e. I was very thin).
   In a couple of examples an oblique pronoun co-occurs with a noun. In these examples it is
difficult to determine whether the two belong to one NP or to different NPs. However, the fact
that pronouns usually occur alone in a NP, and that there is usually (but not always) a pause
between the pronoun and the noun, suggests that it may be better to treat these examples as
containing two apposed NPs, as in the English translations.
     (4-319) Yandu irrî          ngaya     bulungunga-nka.
             wait   3PL.S(NP) 3SG.F.OBL young.woman.II-DAT
             They wait for her, the young woman.
     (4-320) Yangula g-a         yarru naniyaga          mujuju-ngunya
             NEG       3SG.S-PST go     that.II.SG.NOM menstruation-PROP.II(NOM)
             irrîga-yîli-nmanji juwa-nmanji.
             3PL.OBL-COMIT-ALL man.I-ALL
             That menstruating woman can't go near them, the men.
   However, in at least one example in the corpus, a pronoun appears between a modifier and
a noun, making the apposition analysis harder to justify:
     (4-321) Jawaranya          ng-u        yidanyî ngaba ng-u               yardi
             billycan.II(ACC) ISG.A-FUT get          THEN      1SG.A-FUT put
             yaniya           cool drink nînaka            nanga         juglni-nka.
             that.IV.SG.ACC cool drink this.I.SG.DAT 3SG.M.OBL boy.t-DAT
             I'm going to get the billycan and put that cold drink (in it) for this boy.
   Further investigation is required. In particular, it is necessary to test whether a pronoun +
noun combination can appear before the auxiliary before it can be determined whether they
can together make up a single NP.
INALIENABLE POSSESSION
   As mentioned in §4.8, Wambaya makes a formal distinction between two types of
possessive constructions: alienable and inalienable. In constructions of alienable possession
the possessor is expressed by either a possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or by a nominal
inflected with either the dative or genitive case. In constructions of inalienable possession,
however, there is no special marking on the possessor nominal and the two nominals occur in
juxtaposition. Examples of constructions of alienable possession are found in §4.8. §4.6.
§4.4.4 and §4.4.10. A discussion of inalienable possession follows.
   Constructions of inalienable possession are the most common type of what are commonly
referred to as part-whole constructions.81 These constructions are thus in contrast to those of
alienable possession, which encode two entities as being associated, but easily separable.","[148, 149, 150, 151, 152]"

4.5 DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY
4.5.1 NOMINAL-TO-NOMINAL MORPHOLOGY
4.5.1.1 -JARRA/-YARRA `NEXT, ANOTHER'
   This suffix is found with only four words in the corpus. Three of them are time nominals
with which the suffix expresses the meaning `next'. The other is the noun maga `camp,
country' (Iv) with which the suffix expresses the meaning `another'. There does not appear to
be any phonological conditioning as to the form of the suffix. The allomorph with the initial
stop occurs with maga `camp, country' and that with the initial glide is found with the time
nominals.37
      bulinama        tomorrow          >    bulîna-yarra           day after tomorrow
      ngijininima     tomorrow          >    ngijînî-yarra          day after tomorrow
      garnumba        wet season        >    garnumba-yarra         next wet season
      maga            camp              >    maga-jarra             another place
37 This suffix may be related to the Kayardild suffix -varrad- `another' (Evans 1995a).
                                                                                          Nominals      1034.5.1.2 REFLEXIVE-POSSESSIVE SUFFIX
   The form of this suffix is -liji and it is found only with masculine kinship nouns.38 The
function of this suffix, although not yet fully understood, is apparently to explicitly mark the
fact that the `possessor' of the kin is the subject (as opposed to the speaker, for example).39
Thus, there is an alternation among some kinship terms in the corpus between plain forms, as
given in §123.2, and forms suffixed with -liji. For example:
     (4-211) Ngajbî gin-a          ganggu     yarru-warda.
             see    3SG.M.A-PST FF.I(ACC) go-INF
             He saw grandfather walking (along).
     (4-212) Ngajbî gin-a           ganggu-liji         yarru-warda.
             see     3SG.M.A-PST    FF.I-REFL.POSS(ACC) go-INF
             He saw his grandfather walking (along).
   A sentence such as (4-211) is potentially ambiguous as to whose ganggu is in question:
the subject's or the speaker's (as in `He saw (my) Grandfather walking along'). In example
(4-212), however, the meaning can only be that the subject saw his own ganggu. Thus, -liji
appears to be a reflexive possessive marker, indicating that the possessor of the kin is the
subject Other examples include:
     (4-213) Garnguji          juwa            irri        gulug-ba. Gabi irr-a
              many_I(NOM) man.I(NOM) 3PL.S(NP) sleep-FUT NEG 3PL.S-PST

              be.ashamed sleep-FUT cousin.-REFL.POSS(NOM) MMB.I-REFL.POSS(NOM)
              barnga-liji.40

              They sleep with many men. They don't have any shame. (They) sleep with their
              cousins, their great-uncles, their cousins.
     Importantly, the antecedent for -liji must be third person:
     (4-214) *Ngaj-ba ny-u                baba-liji.
                see-FUT 2SG.A-FUT brother.I-REFL.POSS(ACC)
              You'll see your brother.
     (4-215) *Ngaj-ba ng-u                baba-liji.
                see-FUT ISG.A-FUT brother.I-REFL.POSS(ACC)
              I'll see my brother.","[120, 121]"
"5     In dreamtime stories where this sort of a construction is common (e.g. `make oneself into a bird'), the
      verb yardi `put' is used reflexively, with the resultant state expressed as a subject complement. Thus:
          J1anvila            wurlu-ngg-a yardi bungmaj-bulu.
          eaglehawk.II(ACC) 3DU.A-RR-NF put            old.person-DU(ACC)
          The two old women turned themselves into eaglehawks.
6     This is a type of bird — see Text 2 in Appendix A.
7     Wierzbicka (1988:116-117) discusses such constructions in Japanese. However, in Japanese these
      experiential sentences are only possible in the first person.
                                                                   Parts of speech and other preliminaries     49  For a more detailed discussion of verbless clauses and the use of mina as a copula-like
verb see §7.1.
   These adjectives are doubly interesting as they each have a homophonous verb form which
has the same meaning as the subjective meaning of the adjective. That these are verbs and not
adjectives is shown in the following examples in which the form co-occurs with an auxiliary
and takes no gender agreement with the subject NP.8
    (3-6)    Bagijbi gi            juruma.
             feel.bad 3SG.S(PR) stomach.I1I(NOM)
             He feels no good in the stomach.
    (3-7) Gurzjbi g-u             marala            ngaji-ni.
          feel.good 3SG.S-FUT heart.IV(NOM) see-LOC
          She will be happy to see (her). (lit. Her heart will feel good seeing (her).)
(iii) Free Pronouns
    Free pronouns form a small, closed class. They are referred to as 'free' to differentiate
them from the 'bound' pronouns that form part of the auxiliary (discussed below). Free
pronouns distinguish person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural) and.
make an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person non-singular. There are no third
person singular subject or object pronouns; demonstratives are used instead.
   Free pronouns have a different system of case marking from nouns and adjectives. While
nouns and adjectives have an ergative/absolutive system of case marking, free pronouns have
a nominative/accusative declension with nominative and ergative case forms being
homophonous- Free pronouns also have an oblique form which is used in the dative case and
as the base for the addition of other case suffixes such as the comitative. In the case of non-
singular pronouns, this oblique form is homophonous with the accusative case form.
a    It is interesting to consider the possible relationship between the verbs and their corresponding adjectives.
     The final jbi of the adjective gurijbi (and also bagijbi) is identical to a final sequence that in Wambaya is
     quite distinctively verbal. There are many verbs that have this form: ngajbi 'see', gajbi 'eat', nyagajbi 'be
     tired', and it is also found in verbs derived from adjectives with the inchoative suffix jbi: yarduga
     'strong' (Iv) becomes varduga jbi 'become strong' (see §6.2.2.1). This suggests that the adjective gurijbi
     may be derived from the verb gurijbi, thereby accounting for its verb-like form. This theory is supported
     by the other gender forms of the adjective which are all based on this (verbal) form. The usual case
     among adjectives is for the Class iv form to he identical to the root, and therefore to serve as the base for
     the derivation of the other gender forms (see §4.2.2). However with gurijbi it is the Class I form (which
     is identical to the verbal form) from which the other forms are derived. This is shown most clearly by the
     Class II form gurijbi-rna in which the Class Ii gender suffix is simply added on to the full Class I form.
     The situation with bagijbi is different in at least two respects. Firstly, there is some variation among
     speakers as to whether the Class I form of the adjective is correctly pronounced bagijbi or bagiji. For
     some speakers either form is possible, for others only the latter is possible as the Class I form of the
     adjective. And secondly, the other gender forms are not derived from the Class I (and verbal) form, as is
     the case with gurijbi, but are clearly all derived (quite regularly) from a common root bagig - :
          Class I     bagiji/(bagijbi)
          Class 11 bagi-nga
          Class III baging-ma
          Class Iv bagi-ga
     The verbal form bagijbi is clearly also derived from this root.
     The next question is why, if the Class I form of the adjective is actually bagiji, it is often pronounced
     bagijbi, which is the verbal form? It seems quite probable that this could have happened on analogy with
     gurijbi, particularly as it is quite common in fast speech for both gurijbi and bagijbi to he pronounced
     guriji and bagiji respectively (even for the verbal form).
50     Chapter 3Singular pronouns have homophonous nominative, accusative and ergative case forms and
then a different oblique form. Free pronouns are discussed in §4.8.
(iv) Demonstratives
   Demonstratives in Wambaya make a two-way spatial distinction which is roughly
comparable to the distinction in English between `this' and `that'. Demonstratives must also
agree with their referent in case, gender and number. Like nouns and adjectives,
demonstratives can occur alone as the head of a NP, or function as a modifier. Demonstratives
are discussed in §4.6.
(v) Locational nominals
   These nominals are inherently locative and include the compass directionals (langga
`north', ngîrnii `south', gagarra `east', bayungu `west'), other general directionals (gayangga
`up', jangi `down'), locational demonstratives (gili `here', gîlîyaga `there') and other
locationals such as murrgu `inside'. Although these locational nominals can be inflected with
the allative and ablative cases, they are distinguished from other nominals by not taking the
locative case; they occur uninflected in a locative NP:
     (3-8)   Mirra gî-n              murrgu.
             sit    3SG.S(PR)-PROG inside
             She's sitting inside.
(vi) Temporal nominals
   Temporal nominals provide temporal information for the clause and thus tend to have co-
occurrence restrictions with the tense of the clause. Temporal nominals are found in the
corpus with only the locative and dative nominal case suffixes; for example ngurraramba-nî
`in the night' (night-LOC) and ngijininîma-nka `until tomorrow' (tomorrow-DAT).
(vii) Indefinite/interrogatives
   Cross-cutting this division of nominals is the subclass of indefinite/interrogatives. These
nominals can be used both as interrogatives (e.g. `who') and as indefinites (e.g. `someone').
There are indefinite/interrogative pronouns (e.g. gayini `who, someone/what, something'),
quantifiers (e.g. yangulany- `how many, some amount'), locationals (e.g. injani `where,
somewhere'), and temporals (e.g. yangulu `when, sometime'). Indefinite/interrogatives tend
to occur initially in the clause. These nominals are discussed in §4.7.","[66, 67, 68]"
"81    Although, as pointed out by Chappell and McGregor (1989:28), constructions of inalienable possession
      encode not so much a part-whole relation, but rather one in which two entities are seen to be inextricably
      linked. See also Hale (1981). McGregor (1985) and Chappell and McGregor, eds (1995) for a discussion
      of inalienability and part—whole relations in other languages.
                                                                                           Nominals     135Inalienable possession in Wambaya is most commonly used with body parts (4-323) to (4-
325), but is also used with other entities such as tracks (example (4-326)) and names (4-
327).
   As mentioned above, the construction of inalienable possession differs from that of
alienable possession in that the two nominals are simply juxtaposed without any special
morphological marking. These two constructions also differ in the way that they are
registered in the auxiliary. In alienable constructions, it is the possessed noun (the head of the
phrase) which is registered in the auxiliary. In inalienable const ructions, however, it is the
'possessor' nominal which is registered. This difference is shown in the following two
examples, of which the first is an alienable construction and the second is one of inalienable
possession.
   (4-322) Dagwna ng-a           ngangi         janjî.
           hit        ISG.A-PST 2SG.POSS.I(ACC) dog.I(ACC)
           I hit your dog.
   (4-323) Nyamî ngî-ny-a                daguma labîrra.
             2SG.ACC ISGA-20-NF hit              hand.IV(ACC)
             I hit your hand.
    If the inalienable construction is considered to be made up of 2 NPs: one which contains
the `possessor' nominal and bears the grammatical relation, and another which contains the
`possessed' entity and is a complement of the first NP, then this difference in the cross-
referencing behaviour of the two possessive constructions is easily explained. Under this
analysis it is simply the head of the NP bearing the grammatical relation which is registered:
janji 'dog' (I) in example (4-322) and nyami `you.ACC' in (4-323). The nominal labîrra in (4-
323) cannot be registered as it belongs to a NP which does not bear the grammatical relation
(but is simply a complement); and the possessor nominal in (4-322) cannot be registered as it
is not the head of the NP in which it occurs.82
   The behaviour of inalienable constructions in reflexive/reciprocal clauses also suppo rts the
analysis that treats the `possessed' entity as a complement to the 'possessor' NP. Usually a
reflexive/reciprocal construction contains no overt object NP, only the reflexive/reciprocal
bound pronoun in the auxiliary. However, in constructions of inalienable possession, it is
possible to have an overt NP representing the object:
   (4-324) Langanjardi j-ba ngu-ngg-u                  jartga.
             hang.up-TH-FUT I SG.A-RR-FUT foot.IV(NOM)
             I'll put my feet up (on the back of the chair).
   This suggests that the overt NP, here janga, is not the object (as the object is represented
by the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun), but a complement to the object.
   A few other examples of inalienable constructions are:
   (4-325) Warima ginî-ng-a       labirra.
           hold     3SG.M.A-IO-NF hand.IV(ACC)
           He held my hand.","[152, 153]"

1.1.4 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
   Ken Hale's unpublished field notes on Wambaya (Wambaia) (63 pages, including a brief
sketch grammar)12 and Gudanji (Goodanji) (28 pages) gathered in 1959 and 1960
respectively constitute the first significant work done on these languages. More recently
almost all of the major work on the West Barkly languages has been done by Neil Chadwick.
As well as some articles (e.g. Chadwick 1971, 1979, 1984) this work includes a published
grammar of Jingili (Chadwick 1975) and his PhD dissertation `The West Barkly languages,
complex morphology' (1978). This thesis is a detailed morphological analysis of the core
aspects of the grammars of all the West Barkly languages and probably represents the only
detailed work that will ever be done on at least Ngarnga and Binbinka, for which there are
almost no full speakers left.
   Aside from Hale's and Chadwick's work, there is a recently completed PhD dissertation
on Jingili by Rob Pensalfini (1997); an Australian National University honours thesis by
Stuart Campbell (no date) which provides a grammatical sketch and short word list based on
Hale's field notes and recordings; and a brief grammatical sketch of Gudanji by E.F. Aguas
(1968). The rest of the available information consists of a few small word lists (e.g. Hercus
1983, Dymock 1985); a few anthropological a rticles (mainly concerning the subsection
system, see below) written at the turn of the century (e.g. Mathews 1900, 1908); and some
brief references in other more general texts and articles (e.g. Lindsay 1887, Spencer and
Gillen 1904, Basedow 1907, Capell 1963, Yallop 1969, and Tindale 1974). There is also a
report by John Avery (1990) about the Wambaya/Anthony Lagoon land claim which provides
useful anthropological, social and historical information about the Wambaya, Gudanji and
Ngarnga communities.",[24]

7.2.2.2 INTRANSITIVE VERBS WITH VERBAL COMPLEMENTS
   A few intransitive verbs subcategorise for a purposive non-finite subordinate clause, in
which the verb (along with any objects) is inflected with the dative case. For some verbs such
as garrajbi `to want to VCOMP' this is the only possible case frame. Other verbs, such as
dabudaburri `be no good at VCOMP, be unable to VCOMP', gurijbi `feel good, happy to
VCOMP' and bagijbi `feel bad, unhappy to VCOMP' can also function as simple intransitive
verbs; see §7.2.2.1.
   (7-49)     Garrajbî gî-n           yarru-nka.
              want     3SG.S(PR)-PROG go-DAT
              She wants to go.
   (7-50)     Dabudaburri 10 gi-n             nganga manku-nka.
              be.unable       3SG.S(PR)-PROG 2SG.OBL hear-DAT
              He can't hear you.
   (7-51)     Gurijbi ngi            gannga-nka.
              feel.good ISG.S(PR) "" return-DAT
              I'm happy to be going back.
   The transitive verb gudijbi `lose, forget' has an alternative case frame in which it occurs
with a nominative subject and a dative-marked verbal complement. In this case it means
`forget about, forget to':10 This verb has a few different case frames and its meaning is a little difficult to characterise succinctly. It
    can occur with a verbal complement as in example (7-50), and can also occur with a dative NP argument:
      (i) Dabudaburri nyi              nganggi-nka        ngariana-nka!
            be.no.good.at 2SG.S(PR) 2SG.POSS.IV-DAT language.iv-DAT
            You're no good at your own language!
    or with only a subject NP. In these examples it is usually translated as `feel weak, no good':
      (ii) Dabudaburri ngi.
            be.no.good     ISG.S(PR)
            I feel weak/no good.
    Thus the omission of the verbal complement in example (7-50) would change the meaning of the phrase
    to something more like `he's no good' or `he's weak'.
                                                                  Syntax of simple sentences   183   (7-52)    Gudijbî g-a           înîyaga         yugu-ji-nka.
             forget    3SG.S-PST that.I.SG.NOM cry-TH-DAT
             He forgot about crying. (re a child who stopped crying to play)
   There is one verb in the corpus which subcategorises for a verbal complement in the
locative case. This verb, aradajbî `be busy', can also appear as a simple intransitive verb, in
which case the activity that is being engaged in is left unexpressed.
   (7-53)   Aradajbî gî-n               mawula-nî.
            be.busy 3SG.S(PR)-PROG play-LOC
            She's busy playing (cards).
   Another verb, gannga `return', can take a verbal complement in the ablative case
expressing the activity that the subject returned from doing.
   (7-54)   Gannga g-a            alalangmi-ji-nnga Jabiru.
            return    3SG.S-PST hunt-TH-ABL         jabiru(NOM)
            The Jabiru returned from hunting.","[200, 201]"

4.3.2 DUAL
4.3.21 THE DUAL SUFFIX
   Dual marking (either in the form of the dual suffix, or the numeral gujarra- `two') is
usually obligatory in NPs with dual referents (although in a few rare examples, it is not
present on all members of the NP; see example (4-25)). The dual suffix has two main
allomorphs: -bulu with consonant-final roots and -wulu with vowel-final roots. According to
the morphophonemic processes of elision and assimilation described in §2.3.2 and §2.3.4.1
respectively, -wulu becomes -yulu after a final /i/ and -ulu (optionally) after a final /u/. The
dual suffix usually attaches to the root of both Class I and II nouns — that is, the form
excluding the gender suffix — as in examples (4-27), (4-28), thus providing a good test for
the identification of the root of these nouns.19 However, with Class m and IV nouns, it
attaches to the citation form, following any gender suffix ((4-29), (4-30)). It attaches to the
root of nominal modifiers and suffixes. Gender is not marked with the dual suffix; this is true
for both nouns and for their modifiers. If the speaker wants to specify the gender of a dual-
inflected noun it is necessary to use modifiers which inherently express gender, such as
demonstratives (4-27). Some examples of the dual suffix are:.
     (4-27) Naniyawulu     bun              wurlu-n        yarru.
            thatILDU.NOM old.person-DU(NOM) 3DU.S(NP)-PROG go
            Those two old women are coming.
     (4-28) Ngajbi ng-a        îlarra-wulu.

            I saw two eaglehawks.",[91]
"
   My greatest debt is to the Wambaya people who welcomed me into their community and
taught me, so patiently, what I know of their language. In particular I would like to thank my
friends and language teachers, Molly Nurlanyma Grueman, Minnie Niyamarrama Nimara,
Mavis Bangarinya Hogan and Powder Bangarinji O'Keefe (Gudanji) for their never-ending
cooperation, tolerance and patience. They cheerfully shared with me their language and their
stories, answered my questions, and corrected my mistakes. For their support and friendship
I would also like to thank many other people from Elliott and Tennant Creek, including:
Florine Bathern, Ivy Duncan, Amy and Jeffrey Dixon, Billy Hayes, Sandra Hogan, Judy
Holt, Ian Hopwood, Michael Neade, Penny Watson, Heather Wilson and Oscar Wilson; all
of the people who participated in the Wambaya literacy workshop in Tennant Creek in April
1993; and, especially, Moana Strauss for generously sharing her flat and car during my
months of fieldwork. The Gurungu Council in Elliott, who initiated this project, helped
enormously in obtaining funding for my visits and was always cooperative, as was the
Papulu Apparr-kari language centre in Tennant Creek.
   A very special thanks goes to. Nick Evans, who was a dedicated and enthusiastic MA
supervisor, and who first got me interested in working on Australian languages. Without his
invaluable advice, support and encouragement this project might never have got off the
ground. Robert Hoogenraad provided general encouragement and help in the field and I was
also fortunate enough to spend some time in the field with Luise Hercus, David Nash and
Gavan Breen, whose kind support and advice were most appreciated. Many thanks are due
also to John Henderson and Robert Hoogenraad, who provided much-needed computer
assistance. For insightful comments on various aspects of this grammar I am indebted to
Peter Austin, Juliette Blevins, Joan Bresnan, Margaret Carew, Ian Green, John Hajek and
Lesley Stirling. In particular, my revisions to this grammar have benefited enormously from
the comments and suggestions of my two MA examiners, Bill McGregor and Jane Simpson.
Of course, none of these people can be held responsible for any of the remaining flaws or
inadequacies.
   This project would not have been possible without the financial support of the Australian
Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies grant L91/4100, and the Australian
Research Council grant A58930745 (awarded to Nick Evans) entitled 'Non-Pama-Nyungan
languages of Northern Australia: descriptive, grammatical, comparative and sociolinguistic
investigations'. Funding for an additional field trip in 1994 was provided by the Centre for
the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University, with the help of Peter Sells
and Stanley Peters. I thank all these people and organisations for their generous support.
   My heartfelt thanks go to Dean Robinson, who stood by me throughout this project and
put up with my many moods and absences. My family and friends also provided much
valued support and encouragement. I thank them all for their patience and understanding.

Note on translations
Translations in this work are mostly my own. Those that are not are given in inverted
commas. Where English makes distinctions that Wambaya does not (such as definiteness in
NPs) I have made these distinctions in the English translations according to context.
