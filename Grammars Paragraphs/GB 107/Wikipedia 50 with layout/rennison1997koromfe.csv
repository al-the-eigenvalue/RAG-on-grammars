Syntax1.4 Negation
1.4.1 Sentence negation
A sentence can be negated either with the negative particle ba, which is
positioned before the verb, or by the use of a negative subject pronoun
from the list given in (261), all of which are proclitics on the verb.
(261)    Subject (clitic) pronouns, positive and negative                                positive              negative         person           singular    plural    singular    plural

         3rd dim in.      ga    The phonological shape of the negative subject pronouns suggests that
they could have originated in the suppression of the initial b of the nega-
tive particle ba, at least in some of the forms, with subsequent vowel har-
mony: e.g. 1st person singular ma ba -+ ma a -+ ma a. I know of no case
where the two types of negation are not interchangeable, so long as there
exists a negative pronoun; however, I also know of no reason why the b of
ba should be suppressed, since b's are not otherwise weakened or lost
phonologically.
    An example of sentence negation with ba is given in (262) and with
negative pronouns in (263)-(264). The negative pronouns are preferred,
when usable, but not obligatory when the subject of the sentence is a pro-
noun, as can be seen in (265). For further details of the negative pronouns,
see ยง2.1.2.1.10 below.

"1.4.3 More than one negation element in a sentence
If there is more than one negation element in a sentence, the result is
negative, provided that both occur in the same clause. There is only one
case in which more than one negation element occur in a single sentence,
and that is the constituent negation described immediately above and ex-
emplified in (268).
    It is possible to negate a subordinate clause of a negative main clause,
in which case the result is positive, as shown in (270).

"    However, ja can also occur at other positions in the clause, as shown
in (321), where the banging together of the foreheads of the fighting hip-
popotamus and elephant forms the climax (and end) of their tug-of-war.
    Although it cannot easily be distinguished from constituent emphasis
of the verb only, both contradictory and non-contradictory emphasis of a
sentence can also be expressed by the use of the emphatic particle la after
the verb. 46 In contradistinction to the emphasis of an NP, the emphatic
particle in this usage cannot be replaced by the negative emphatic particle

tence negation, as exemplified in (269).

1.1.1.2.1.2 Leading
1.1.1.2.1.2.1 Expecting the answer yes
The yes-no questions suggesting a positive response are formed syntacti-
cally in an identical way to the neutral yes-no questions (i.e. positive de-
clarative sentence plus sentence-final question particle), but use different
question particles. There are two particles, kal and d:J which are used in
this type of yes-no question. Both particles are also words in their own
right: kal is a comparative particle meaning 'rather' or 'more (than)', and
d:J is the negative copula or emphatic particle (corresponding to the posi-
tive particle La). The examples given in (17}--(22) correspond to those in
the (positive) declarative sentences (5)-(10) and the neutral questions
(11)-( 16). Note that the position of the question particle (always sentence-
final) is the same in all types of yes-no questions. Here, only examples
with kal have been given; the examples with d:J are identical when the
question particle is switched.

"1.1.1.3.2 The negative imperative/arms
The negative imperative is formed in the same way as the positive impera-
tives that use ke, but introduced by the negative conjunction ka instead of
the ke; in this case, an overt 2nd person subject (proclitic or disjunctive) is
obligatory and the 2pL. subject na must precede the verb (in contrast with
the true positive imperative, where na follows the verb). This construction
is identical with the indirect negative command (cf. ยง1.1.2.2.5. below).",[74]
"
2.1.1.4.19.5 Partitive negative quantifier
As with the other partitives described here, the negative partitive quanti-
fier has a set-subset structure. The negative particle baa precedes the sub-
set NP, and that NP has the quantifier 'one' (expressible in various ways
such as the numeral quantifiers dom or dole, or the disjunctive numeral
gad:Jm). Examples are given in (430}-(43 1). Note that in (431) the topic
NP is (optionally) singular. This is only possible with the negative parti-
tive, not with the positive partitive.

        ART.   man + SG. child + SG. NEG. one (DlSJ.) NEG. come + PAST
        'No boy came.' (Lit.: 'A boy, not one didn't come. ')
2.1.1.4.19.6 Non-partitive negative quantifier
Non-partitive negative NPs with a countable kernel noun can be formed in
a manner similar to the subset NPs with a partitive negative, i.e. by the use
of the negative particle baa and the numeral 'one'. An example is given in
(432). However, it is also possible to have an 'article + noun' structure and
simply negate the verb, as in (433).",[200]
"1.2.5.2.6 Quantifiers
Quantifiers follow the noun which they quantify in a position intermediate
between contentful adjectives (to the left of the quantifiers) and any
DETERMINER or DEICTIC that may be present (to their right). Numerals
precede other quantifiers. Some simpler examples, with universal quantifi-
cation, are: e.g. a bJrJ doro 'every man', a benna doro 'all men', a kE5
doro 'every woman', a kEna doro 'all women'. The quantifier doro can
also be used with (clitic) pronouns, e.g. 0 doro 'all ofus'.
     The zero quantifier is syntactically quite complex and also, inciden-
tally, involves the only case of double negation in Koromfe. For countable
nouns, a noun phrase 'no X' usually has the structure baa X dom, where
baa is the (prenominal long variant of the) NEGATIVE PARTICLE 34 and dom
is the attributive CARDINAL NUMERAL 'one'. The verb is also negated
(either by repeating the NEGATIVE PARTICLE ba preverbally, or by the use of
a negative pronoun). Examples are given in (228)-(229).

1.1.1.2.4.2.1.1 Wordsfor yes', 'no', 'maybe'
The words for 'yes' and 'no' in Koromfe vary slightly (stylistically?) in
their phonetic realization - I have therefore transcribed them in greater
phonetic detail than usual. Also, these words are accompanied by a dis-
tinctive intonation pattern, which I have marked with high and low tone
marks, where appropriate, in the examples given here. It seems that the
most important thing about these words is that when disyllabic, 'yes' al-
ways has a rising tone pattern (LH) and 'no' a falling pattern (HL).

1.2.1.1.3.1 The be-copula
There exist different, but still obligatory be-copulas for adverbial local
adverbial complements; the copulas la (positive) and d:J (negative) cannot
be used. Instead, the verb WE is used in the appropriate inflectional form.
In contrast with La and d:J, which have no other inflectional forms, this
verb has all inflectional forms apart from a gerund, although the PAST and
UNMARKED forms are homophonous (for quite regular phonological rea-
sons: the -t: suffix merges with the stem vowel e). The negative counterpart
of WE is 1)go or 1)gose, which has only these two forms (the first being
UNMARKED and the second probably PAST). As with La and d:J, the positive
verb WE cannot be used with a negative pronoun or particle; instead, 1)go
must be used.","[99, 100]"
"2.1.8.1.6 Sentence particles
There are two types of particle which might be considered sentence parti-
cles: the sentence-final interrogative particles and the preverbal negative
particles (ba and arguably also aa). The interrogative particles are de-
scribed in ยง 1.1.1.2.1 and the negative particles in ยง 1.4.1. I do not consider
the (apparently) sentence-initial particle handa of the yes-no question
echo-questions in ยง 1.1.1.2.3.3 to be truly sentence-initial, but rather to be
an ellipsis of something like n handa bole ke ... 'Did you really say that...',
where handa is a pre-verbal adverb (cf. ยง 1.2.1.3 .2.1 above).",[349]

have a high tone. Also, a negative personal pronoun always shortens the
long final aa of a following PROGRESSIVE verb form. I have no idea why
this should be so, though I suspect that the reason must be prosodic.
    In negative imperative sentences, the sentence-initial negative particle
ka is used, as described in ยง 1.1.1.3 .2. The examples from that section are
repeated here for convenience:

1.4.5 Negation of a verb in a subordinate clause by the negation of the
verb of a higher clause
Negation quite typically moves up from subordinate clauses towards the
front of the sentence. This movement can go through more than one
clause. Examples were given in (263)-(264) above, where 'I think that not
X' is optionally expressed as 'I do not think that X'. However, this can
only work if a single negative noun clause is embedded in a positive
clause (or series of clauses - cf. ยง1.4.3 above). Sentences (271)-(273)
show each stage of this kind of movement; the middle stage, i.e. (272),
seems to be less usual than the other two.

"3.3.2.2.2 Phrase stress
On the phrase level, there is maximally a single stress which can be as-
signed to a noun phrase or an adverb-verb group,63 both for normal and for
contrastive stressing. This phrasal stress is expressed by a high tone on the
final full-vowel syllable of the first stressable word in the phrase.
    A negative marker, if present, always receives the stress of the adverb-
verb group, expressed as a higher tone. This means that if the verb is a
PROGRESSIVE form or verbal adjective with a final long faa!, this is short-
ened to a single short [a].
    Typically, nouns, verbs, adjectives (of both types) or adverbs carry
phrasal stress, but other word types, i.e. the 'grammatical' words (apart
from the sentence-final yes-no question particles) do not. Proclitic weak
pronouns are not stressable, but strong (disjunctive) pronouns with the
'dummy' word stem -b are. The article a which precedes almost every
word of a word list has a considerably lower amplitude and lower tone
than the following noun. Post-nominal DETERMINERS or DEICTICS such as
h01J (HUM. SG.) are also quieter and on a lower tone than the noun which
they qualify. Conjunctions and relative pronouns introducing a subordinate
clause are never stressed.

                                Preface
This book is the result of 16 years of work on Koromfe, alongside other
linguistic interests. It would not have been possible without the active and
passive support of several people. I would especially like to thank my
family, who increased during those years from 2 to 5 (other) members, for
their active interest in the early stages and for their patience during the
final stages.
    Annemarie Schweeger-Hefel (t) put her house in Tulfes, Tyrol at my
disposal for my first informant sessions and provided me with background
information on the culture of the Koromba without which I would have
been lost.
    A grammar of this kind is never 'finished', especially for a perfec-
tionist like myself, and writing it has raised many further questions which
I wish I had the time and resources to try to answer. I thank my informants
for their help and Bernard Comrie, the series editor, for his extremely
attentive inspection of the manuscript and suggestions for revisions, which
were always to the point and well-received. Special thanks go to Oskar
Pfeiffer for his diligent proofreading of the manuscript. Of course, the
entire responsibility for what is written here is my own, and I absolve all
others from any part of the blame for the faults that may remain.
    I would welcome feedback from anyone working on related languages

"1. B.l. 4 Other means
I.B.l.4.1 Verbs
Comparison is expressed by one of verbs kilEI or (rarer) kisam meaning
'to surpass, exceed, be more than'. There is no such thing as a comparative
morphological form (such as adjective) in Koromfe. Examples of compari-
son within a single clause are given in (301}-{303).
(301)   kemde           d:n           kE       la      bAdini
        (proper name) length (so.) exceed EMPH. (proper name)
        'Kemde is bigger than Badini.' (Lit.: 'Kemde's length exceeds BadiniCs). ')(302)   bAdini          bEU                      tao   kElaa            kemde
        (proper name) coming (ACTION NOUN) fast exceed + PROO. (proper name)
        'Badini comes faster than Kemde.' (Lit.: 'Badini's fast coming surpasses
        Kemde('s). ')(303)   d;}               h5nE                       kE     d;}
        PRON. 3so. HUM.   play/dancing (ACTION NOUN) exceed PRON. 3so. HUM.
        tOIDA
        work + PL.
        'He plays more than he works.' (Lit. 'His play exceeds his work ')
1. B.l. 4. 2 The comparative particle kru
This exists one further, minor possibility. The comparative particle kal
'rather' (which is also used as a yes-no question particle) can be used
together with the negative emphatic particle d:J or a negated verb to form a
'more of an X than an Y' type of utterance. Examples are given in (304)-
(305).",[150]
"2.1.1.2.9 Complement ofa copular construction
The complement of a copular construction is not marked in any special
way. It normally follows the copula, but can optionally precede the copu-
las la (positive) or d:J (negative) - see ยง2.1.1.2.3 above. No distinction is
made between copular complements which express a definition, identity,
role or copular complements of other verbs - therefore ยง2.1.1.2.9.1-4 are
inapplicable.",[187]
"        'I hit the tamtam with a stick.'
2.1.1.4.3a Negative instrumental
This category does not exist in its own right. Like other negative catego-
ries, it can be paraphrased by adding a second clause which consists of the
positive equivalent (here: 'with a stick', as exemplified in (387) above)
plus the negative emphatic particle dJ, as shown in (388).
(388)   mg            d:>m a    debre        la      la           (a)

        'I hit the tamtam without a stick.' (Lit. 'I hit the tamtam, but not with a stick. ')
2.1.1.4.4 Comitative
Like the instrumental, the comitative is expressed by the preposition lao
An example is given in (389).
(389)   mg            jao la          bAdini
        PRON. ISG.    go with (PREP.) (proper name)
        'I left with Badini.'
2. 1. l.4.4a Negative comitative
The negative comitative paraphrase with dJ which corresponds to (389) is
given in (390).
(390)   mg            jao la la           bAdin         d:>
        PRON. IsG.    go but with (PREP.) (proper name) NEG. EMPH.

2.1.1.4.5 Circumstance
A typical means of expressing circumstance in Koromfe is 'possession'
with the noun saa 'owner', as shown in (391). The (double) compound
noun W8na Zlgam sa 'hand-dirt owner' is used as an adjective modifying
b:Jr:J, and comprises the compound noun W8n8 Zlgam 'dirt on the hands'
(or simply 'dirty hands') and saa 'owner, owning'.

        'I saw a man with dirty hands.' (Lit.: 'I saw a ""hand-dirt owning"" man. ')
2.1.1.4.5a Negative circumstance
As seen above with other negative categories, negative circumstance is
usually expressed (if at all) by means of d:J, as shown in (392). Alternative
structures are (393), where the negative verb 1Jgo 'not be, not have' is
used, or the more far-reaching paraphrase in (394).

2.1.1.4.6 PossessiveThere are no different types of possessive, and therefore ยง2.1.1.4.6.l-3 are inapplicable.
Possession is most frequently indicated by the NP+N syntactic compound structure (cf.
ยง2.3.1.1.3 below), where NP is the possessor and N the possessed, as shown in (395).
Here NP is rna j55rui:J 'my brother' and N is daT) 'house'. The less frequent (and possi-
                                                                                     155

2.1.1.4.7 Possessed
A 'possessed' noun is normally the second member of an NP+N com-
pound NP or an N+N compound noun, as described in the previous sec-
tion. It has no special marking.","[189, 190, 191]"
"1.2.1.1.6 Different types of copula
The only distinction between the types of copula described above is that
we and its negative counterpart 1)go must be used with a local adverbial
complement. Otherwise, la and its negative counterpart dJ are used for all
copula functions, including defining, identity and role (i.e. ยง 1.2.1.1.6.1-3).
    In addition, there is a verb km:tam 'become', exemplified in (183)-
(184), and a vast variety of adjectival verbs with the meaning 'be X' and
derived verbs meaning 'belbecome X', which are dealt with in the relevant
parts of ยง2.1.3 below.

1.2.1.2 Verbal sentences
1.2.1.2.1 Verbs without subjects or with dummy subjects
Normally, every verb must have an overt subject. But in the short utter-
ances of the type NP-la (185), PP-d.J (186) or ADVERBIAL-la (the last 2
words of (187ยป the emphatic particle la might be considered to be the
copula. In this case, we would have to say that these sentences have no
subject NP (at least for the second case). However, despite their full-
sentence glosses, I do not consider these phrases to be full sentences of
Koromfe, but either elliptical sentences or non-sentential exclamatory
utterances akin to short answers to question-word questions. 25

     The prefixal variant of the 2nd person singular form n is syllabic
phrase-initially and assimilated to the place of articulation of the following
consonant (hence the capital N in table (573)), but is realized as phonetic
[n] in the suffixal variant. The vowel [E] of the suffixal variant results from
the general phonological process of phrase-final filling (cf. ยง3.2.6.4.2.2
below), which gives an I colouring to a phrase-final unspecified vowel
(final phonetic [n] being impossible in polysyllabic words) and of lower-
ing after the nasal consonant.
     There also exists an incomplete set of negative prefixal pronouns,
mentioned in ยง1.4.1 above and given again in (575), which can only be
used as the (prefixed) subject of a verb (which then has a negated reading).

        3rd non-human       gaa
        3rd diminutive    These pronouns clearly consist of the normal prefix pronouns fol-
lowed by a long aa. The missing forms in the paradigm are probably im-
possible for phonological reasons: the 1st plural and 3rd plural non-human
prefix pronouns consist of a single vowel, and the 2nd singular and 2nd
plural forms would be indistinguishable (both presumably being realized
as *naa). Similarly, the 3rd singular diminutive form would be indistin-
guishable from the 3rd singular human form gaa. The last lacuna, the 3rd
plural diminutive is already present in the positive pronoun paradigm.
    My informants denied the existence of aa as a negative particle, but
there are two sentences, given in (576)-(577), in different texts of my
collection, which seem to have it (with subjects other than the prefix pro-
noun).

1.11.2.2.1.3 Verbs
Emphasis of the verb using the VERB            La (positive) or VERB       d:J
(negative) structure (without movement) is also used for sentential empha-
sis and can hardly be distinguished from it. See ยง 1.11.1 above for details.

the use of adverbials such as handa 'really').",[165]

But noun phrases can also be and-coordinated by juxtaposition, as was
exemplified in (242) above.
    Or-coordination of noun phrases was always rejected or paraphrased

particles d:J (negative) and fa (positive), as shown in (252). Such a struc-
ture must always be disjoint, with the 'but Y' part as a post-sentential

"1.2.1.3.2 The positional possibilities for adverbials within the sentence
1.2.1.3.2.1 Adverbs
Adverbs fall into three distinct classes on distributional grounds, and each
class has related semantic characteristics. (Note that clause-final in the
following sub-sections excludes the sentence-final yes-no question parti-
cles, which are always the very last thing in a sentence.)1.2.1.3.2.1.1 Pre-verbal verbal adverbs
This class of adverbs includes the adverbs da 'in the past', handa 'truly' ,28
and occurs before the (first) finite verb of a clause (with the exception of
handa when used as an exclamation outside normal sentence structure -
cf. the pre-sentential echo-question usage of handa in ยง 1.1.1.2.3.3 above).
This is also the position where the negative particle ba occurs when it
qualifies the verb. In the rare event that more than one of these co-occur,
they have the order handa - da - ba.
Sentence (201) below contains an example of da. The adverb handa is
exemplified in (200).

ately before the negated element and a further ba before the verb. One
example is repeated here for convenience as (268). The cardinal numeral

The preverbal position is occupied by personal pronoun subject clitics. See

tween the subject and the verb, as do the adverbs handa 'really' and da 'in
the past' (cf. ยง1.2.1.3.2.1).",[350]
"2.1.6.6 The quantifiers
Apart from the numeral '1', dam, which is used in conjunction with the
negative particle baa to express the zero quantifier 'no', there are
(lexically) only three general quantifiers in Koromfe, given in (710), plus
a Moore paraphrase of one of them (faa for doro, occurring only in the
double quantifier doro faa, of which there are several tokens in only one
text). I have glossed kaa / kama as 'every, all' because this quantifier oc-
curs mainly with singular and rarely with plural nouns, whereas doro 'all,
every' occurs equally freely with singular and plural nouns. The forms kaa
and kama are free variants; the former seems to be used more frequently.

        taa           'all' (universal-loan from Moore)    However, the syntax of the quantifiers is quite complex, thus, for ex-
ample, the notion 'both' is expressed as hIT doro, literally 'two all'. The
syntax of the quantifiers is described in ยง1.2.S.2.6 and ยง2.1.1.4.19 above.
    The quantifier doro is also used adverbially in several meanings: a)
'only, alone' in the first reading of (711), where the scope of doro is n
'you', b) 'and that's all' in the second reading of(711), where the scope of
doro is the whole clause n den 'you pull (him)', c) 'at all', as in (712),
where the scope of doro is again the whole clause n naa dl 'if you see
him'. Note that in all these usages no additional material is present in the
Koromfe sentences to support doro in the same way as English and that:S-
ail or at all.",[345]
"1.1.1.2.4.2.2.1 Questioned noun phrases and prepositional phrases
As mentioned above, the answer to a wh-questioned noun-phrase normally
involves emphasis with the emphatic particle la (or dJ, if negative). If the

the front of the main clause and followed by la). An example question is

1.11.2.1.6 Dislocation
1.11.2.1.6.1 Left dislocation
Constituents which are left-dislocated to the sentence-initial position (but
have no emphatic particle) do exist, but are what I consider to be the topic
of the sentence - though clearly there are many cases where one could
consider the topic of the sentence to be emphasized. (Cf. also ยง 1.11.2.2.1.1
below.) However, such constituents do not always have a position within
the sentence from which they could be said to have been moved (i.e. the
topic can be virtually anything), and when they do have a structural posi-
tion within the sentence, this position is filled with some pronominal ele-
ment. See ยง 1.12 below for details of topics.
     To show that topics are distinct from, and compatible with, empha-
sized constituents, sentences (328)-{329) show how they can be com-
bined. Note that the topic constituent takes precedence over the empha-
sized constituent (i.e. is always in absolute sentence-initial position). (The
topic NP is glossed as 'as for X' and the pause-like dislocation intonation
is transcribed with a dash '-'.) In (328) we have a topic NP followed by a
                                                                          125

"        'It's a black one, the cat that I saw.' (incorrect)     Because the adjective cannot be emphasized alone, using the NEGATIVE
EMPHATIC particle d:J in place of La in sentence (339) negates the whole NP
and produces the reading 'it wasn't a black cat that I saw' - i.e. the NP
could be contrasted with, say, a black dog. In (340), on the other hand,
with the pseudocleft structure, replacing La (here a COPULA!) with d:J pro-
duces the correct results. I.e. a Luko k5na ma na k01)gO a binz,) d:J means

"2.1.4.6 Expression of the categories that characterize the verbal
morphology with predicative a4jectives
2.1.4.6.1 In the a4jective morphology
The 'categories that characterize the verbal morphology of the language'
are the four tense/aspect forms of the verb. These are never expressed on a
nominal adjective, but with verbal adjectives the question is quite difficult.
     There is a considerable problem of elicitation in the area of verbal ad-
jectives when using French (which has few verbal adjectives) as the
working language. In addition, Koromfe has nominal adjectives available
in most cases, and I found that informants often resorted to these when the
going got rough.
     Nevertheless, I think that each true verbal adjective has only a single
morphological form, usually ending in long -aa like the PROGRESSIVE verb
forms and subject to the same shortening processes. The time reference of
such a verbal adjective is present unless modified by an adverb of time
(which can make it refer to past or future time). A list of most of the un-
equivocal verbal adjectives in my corpus is given in (667); words de-
scribing human body positions (sitting, standing, crouching, etc.) have
been omitted, since I consider these to be normal intransitive verbs. 106

"1.1.1.2.1 Yes-no questions
1.1.1.2.1.1 Neutral
Neutral yes-no questions in Koromfe are formed by adding a sentence-
final question particle (glossed as QUEST. below) to a (positive) declarative
sentence. There is no inversion or other change in the linear order of the
sentence constituents. A set of typical declarative sentences with varying
numbers and types of noun phrases are given in (5}--(10), and the corre-
sponding neutral yes-no questions in (11}--( 16).

    However, pitch is used in phrasal accent: the stressed word has a high
pitch (tone) on one of its syllables, all other words have a lower pitch.
This is an intonational or phrase-stress-like use of pitch, and is never lexi-
cally contrastive: indeed it is usually automatic (e.g. on negative markers).
    ยง3.3.3.2-9 are therefore inapplicable.","[466, 467]"

                                                                              Phonology55
     The evidence of word lists is therefore only oflimited use, since it is impossible to
     tell whether a final vowel which complies to the restrictions of colour harmony is
     lexically present or absent. Thus, for example, the final vowel of [boko] 'shoulder'
     is in fact the vowel of the noun class suffix -go, and is lexical, while that of [hoko]
     'throw!' is epenthetic. The lexical vowel of [boko] 'shoulder' can optionally drop
     in medial positions; the vowel of [hoko] 'throw!' obligatorily never occurs in
     phrase-medial positions.
56
     In GP nothing needs to be inserted, because an empty nucleus is already present at
     the end of every consonant-final word. (Koromfe has only a single position in the
     rime, i.e. the non-branching nucleus.) This final empty nucleus (FEN) is parametri-
     cally licensed morpheme-finally (and therefore also word-finally), but not phrase-
     finally except after the onset consonants [m,n,IJ,I]. Why should this be so? The
     general preference of languages for open syllables is overridden in Koromfe (and,
     incidentally, also Moore) by the licensing of phrase-medial final consonants. This
     in turn increases robustness by signalling to the hearer that the phonological phrase
     is not finished and therefore parsing must continue.
57
     Whether the. properties of frontness and backness are transmitted directly from VI
     to V3 or indirectly via V2 can not be decided on the basis of any empirical data that
     I know of.
58
     A handful of realizations of the tense variant of the postposition nE sound like [ne]
     in my recordings; but the overwhelming majority are [ni]. This always contrasts
     with the lax mid vowel (i.e. the form [nE]) but never with a lax high vowel (i.e. a
     form *[m]).
59
     The durative suffix in the words given here is nasalized after a preceding nasal
     consonant or vowel. In [doyom5] 'cut' the expected geminate [mm] resulting from
     the assimilation of /m+d/ is simplified to a single [m] in this position (i.e. after the
     2nd vowel of the word); after the 1st vowel of the word, a geminate surfaces as in
     [d5mm5] 'bite'.
60
     Due to this phonological process, all DURATIVE verb forms that take the suffix -f
     automatically have the phrase-final vowel [0] or [u]. This might tempt us to con-
     sider the shape of the suffix itself to be -fa. However, the ease with which thus [0]
     or [u] vowel is lost in medial positions shows that it cannot be lexically present,
     despite the fact that (phrase-finally) the shape of the suffix is phonetically invari-
     ant.
61
     The apparent crossing of association lines in (853) is an artefact of the two-
     dimensional graphical representation here. Colour harmony emanating from vow-
      els 'takes place' on the nucleus projection, where consonants are 'invisible'. Nev-
      ertheless the question arises why the association to U in [werem5] is stronger than
     the (potential) association to 1.
62
      Since Koromfe has no branching syllable constituents, this is hardly surprising; a
      long glide would have to straddle an empty nucleus without filling it.
63
      By adverb-verb group I mean the finite verb of a sentence, plus the small adverbs
      or particles which can precede the verb (in a position between the subject NP and
      the verb). Such adverbs/particles include in particular both types of negative
      marker, i.e. the disjunctive negative particle [ba] and the series of negative personal
      pronouns with a final long [a:]. I use the word 'group' rather than 'phrase' to avoid
                                                                                        465
Phonology
     confusion with verb-phrases proper, which are much larger than this 'adverb-verb
     group'.
64
     There is a pause of about 1 second at the clause boundary, i.e. between [nil and
     [dg].
65
     There exist two versions of this sentence in my texts. This one is the first, and has
     a weak 2sg. pronoun before [bo]; the second has a strong pronoun [I)b], and there-
     fore a rise in pitch on the syllable [b].
66
     In particular, silent empty nuclei which are never realized as optional schwa are
     ignored for the purpose of this classification of phonological processes.
67
     Strictly speaking, any vowel following another vowel in Koromfe has an interven-
     ing empty nucleus; however, since a) our present purposes are purely descriptive
     and b) a long-distance process of nasalization also exists, we will gloss over this
     point.
68
     The lax variant [hE] of the -hi plural suffix of the deverbal instrument nouns un-
     dergoes lowering in the lax form, but not nasalization, since a) it is lexically nasal
     and b) there is no local source for nasalization. The tense version of the same suf-
     fix, [hi], on the other hand, does not undergo either process.
     The -I suffix of the gull noun class is lowered to [e] after a nasal consonant, but not
     nasalized; after a nasal vowel it undergoes both processes, producing phonetic [E].
69
     In my corpus there are a handful of realizations of the tense variant of the post-
     position ne which sound like [ne]. However, the overwhelming majority of cases
     have [ni]. Similarly for the plural deverbal instrument noun suffix hi: a few [he]
     realizations occur, but the normal realization is [iii].
70
     It is extremely difficult to assess the degree of nasality of the vowel [e] after nasal
     consonants, since the 'oral' version of this and all other vowels is slightly nasal in
     a nasal environment. I therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the vowel leI
     does indeed nasalize here. However, the nasal [E] which follows a nasal vowel, as
     in [t3E] 'bees; honey' sounds much more nasal, as do the long final [EEl's men-
     tioned later in this section.
71
     The only word with such a shape, the plural of [jirvTItu], PL. [jirvinu] 'coal, char-
     coal' has such an unusual and unique phonetic shape that it must be a loan
     (probably from Moore).
72
     No -:J class suffix occurs on a vowel-final word stem; recall that the deverbal agent
     nouns are formed from the DURATIVE stem of the verb, which has a consonantal
     suffix - either -d or-f.
73
     This word also has variants with a non-lowered final vowel: [wEi] and (less fre-
     quent) [w1ii]. However, their existence shows that the lexical vowel here must be
     high and not mid.
74
     This word and a few others (including words in the -gull class) have an irregular
     alternation of a stem-final velar nasal [I)] in the singular with a labial nasal [m] in
     the plural. Apart from PAST verb forms, the word-final sequences [l)e]/[l)e] and [l)i]1
      [I)I] are completely missing from the language; I therefore assume that the lexical
     shape of these words has a velar nasal, and that the labial is derived. However,
     there are too few words to warrant calling this stem alternation an active process of
     the language. Other words of this type are given in the following table. The word
      [wanal)] also has an alternative plural [wania].","[499, 500, 501]"

                   Notes to the Introduction
I   Half in fun, I reconstruct the word Bantu itself (ba-ntu 'people') as being the
    Koromfe word dXJ-ba 'peasants'. All Koromba are peasants. The stem dJ(J)
    probably historically meant 'being' in Koromfe, and can be found in dJJ, PL. dJJn
    'animal' and in dJfre, PL. dJna 'god'. The ba plural morpheme of the human noun
    class is identical in Bantu languages and Koromfe.
I   For example, I did not distinguish 'epenthetic' from lexical final vowels, and had
    some other full vowels for what I now know are schwas.
I   In this context I must add that I have worked extensively on dialectal variation in
    (one variety of Austrian) German, cf. Rennison (1981), and had hoped to find
    something similar in Koromfe - but did not. Some differences in the numerals de-
    scribed by Prost (1980) are discussed in ยง2.1.6 below.","[42, 43, 44]"

Lexicon26
     Apart from its alternative (and more usual) shortened UNMARKED form, this verb is
     regular.
27
     Plurals with the suffix -Ii can be formed from any singular noun form, and should
     therefore be treated with caution. There do exist words with a 'real, original' -Ji
     plural noun-class suffix, but these usually have a corresponding -0 singular.
28
     The hia variant of hie occurs only in extremely careful speech.
29
     See (900) in ยง5.1.1.1 above for further extensions of this word.
30
     The meanings 'have plenty, multiply' are due to accidental homophony.
31
     The kind of 'fog' which exists in the Koromba area consists of wind-borne sand
     which obscures vision; 'fog' consisting of particles of water does not exist.
32
     Temperatures below freezing point are virtually unknown (at least in practice) to
     the Koromba; only the word 'hail' exists.
33
     The word w5eie 'blade of grass' is used to denote 'snake' in order to avoid bad
     luck by mentioning the snake's true name d01Jfe, PL. domi. This choice of euphe-
     mism stems from the long, thin shape shared by both.
34
     The verb dollotMn is the reversive of dollMn 'put', and therefore it primarily de-
     notes the undoing of a (previous) placing of something.
35
     The word na1JW is probably a compound whose first part is the deictic stem na1J
     and whose second part is a shortened form of the word kana given here; however,
     it is the more frequently used term.
36
     Since I have never experienced it in Africa, I am not sure whether this word really
     denotes 'hail' in the proper sense, or whether (like the French word brouillard for
      'fog') it has been taken over to denote some other form of precipitation.
37
     This word is probably a petrified and phonologically eroded version of ba jaa, i.e.
     the negative particle ba and the verb jaa given in this table.
38
     The word tao means 'river' only when it is slow-moving; for moving bodies of
     water gote, PL. gorll / gorllu 'stream, river' is used.
39
     This word is a Moore loan; my informants knew no native Koromfe equivalent.
40
     The word fei is probably a participially used UNMARKED form of the verb felei
     given in this table. However, it is not used as a verb form - probably because the
     basic meaning of this verb, 'live', is viewed as a continuous action which is com-
     patible only with aspects expressed by the DURATIVE and PROGRESSIVE inflection.
41
     The words kesem, P:Jto and waSI cannot be used attibutively, but only as comple-
     ments. Only kesem can be used as an adverb.
42
      See (900) in ยง5.1.1.1 above for further extensions of this word.
43
     The DIMINUTIVE SINGULAR form of this word, ja1Ja 'young female (animal)' does
     not imply motherhood; on the contrary it implies sexual immaturity.
44
      The UNMARKED form of this verb, woro1Jgu is used as a participial adjective
      meaning 'nearby'.
45
      The morpheme aa is found especially in combination with the proclitic subject
      pronouns, e.g. maa 'I...not' from ma 'I'. However, in some of my texts aa occurs
      between a full NP subject and the verb; but my informants rejected any such forms
      and found the usage strange.
46
      Here the abstract noun 'old age' is used as a plural, as in German Jugend 'youth'
      for Jugendliche 'young people' .
47
      This verb has the meaning 'rain' only when the subject is something that can rain
      (i.e. normally the noun vElJa 'rain').","[564, 565]"
