              DedicationTo my Pipil teachers, helpers, and friends.
                            Acknowledgements     I owe a debt of gratitute to many for financial, intellectual, and moral support. I
thank the National Science Foundation and the State University of New York Research
Foundation for grants which supported my fieldwork and investigations in El Salvador. I
am also grateful to the Instituto de Investigaciones Filológicas of the Universidad Nacio-
nal Autónoma de México for support which allowed me to complete some of the histori-
cal aspects of this study and to write it up.
    I wish to thank Maria Esperanza Aguilar de Smith-Stark for much help with Salvado-
ran Spanish from the Pipil area. Claudia Parodi also assisted me with Spanish and in the
initial version of this manuscript (which was written in Spanish, but converted to English
for this publication). While Una Canger did not see the manuscript of this book before
publication, discussions with her helped me in many ways to improve both the content
and its organization.
     Above all, I wish to extend my deep appreciation to my Pipil teachers and consul-
tants, who shared their language with me. I hope that this work will some day in some
way come to be of some benefit to them.

                         Introduction
0. Introduction   The native language of western El Salvador, the subject of this
book, is known in the linguistic literature as Pipil, although its
speakers call it na:wat in the language itself and Nahuate in
Spanish. Here it is called Pipil because this usage is so strongly
entrenched in the scientific literature that it could not easily be
changed. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that Na:wat (Nahuate) may
gain more general acceptance in honor of and in deference to its
speakers.   This book, then, presents a description of this
language.
   This chapter is concerned with the present and past geographical
distribution of Pipil, its history to the extent that it is known,
its genetic classification, and its dialects. The following three
chapters present a description of the language's structure: its
phonology (chapter 2), its lexical categories and morphology (chap-
ter 3), and its syntax (chapter A). Chapter 5 contains the Pipil-
Spanish-English dictionary representing the two main dialects,
Cuisnahuat (C) and Santo Domingo de G u z m á n (SD), with occasional
forms from other dialects.       Chapter 6 is the Spanish-Pipil
dictionary. Chapter 7 contains folkloric texts accompanied by a
morpheme-by-morpheme analysis and translation in Spanish and a more
flowing English narrative translation. Many of the examples cited
in other chapters are taken from these texts, which are coded with
a letter to identify the narrative involved and a number which
refers to the line within the text. The appendices contain addi-
tional historical information. Appendix 1 compares Pipil in detail
with other southern varieties of Nahua in order to determine
precisely its relationship to them. Appendix 2 solves the contro-
versial question concerning the Nahua of central Guatemala, which
have often been assumed to be Pipil but w h i c h turn out to be in
origin post-Conquest and from central Mexico.
   The purpose of this book, then, is to present a basic reference
work on Pipil, a sort of ""handbook"" of the language.

"   4.5.2. Negative imperatives. Second person negative imperatives
are formed with te: ""no"" (C) or ma:/maka (SD), plus the x(i)~
imperative prefix (and -kan in the plural); this should not be
confused with the ma: 'hortatory' particle which occurs with other
persons in imperative constructions (cf. section 3.7.8.1).    Some
examples are:
                                                                    117       1) ma: x-u (SD)
            te: xi-yu (C)                 don't go!       2) te: xi-k-kwa-kan (C)            don't eat it (you pl.)!       3) te: xi-k-elka:wa (C)           don't forget it!       4) ma: xi-nech-mikti (S)          don't kill me!
            maka xi-nech-mikti (S)       don't kill me!       5) maka xi-k-mikti (S)            don't kill it!       6) te: xi-kwa-kan nu-xu:leh-yu. (N-42)
          Don't eat (you pl.) my husband!","[130, 131]"
"
4.5. Imperatives    In the morphology it was seen that the second person imperative
prefix was x(i)-. other persons taking the exhortative particle
ma:, with -kan (underlying -kam-) for plural persons (section
3.7.8.1). Here examples of imperatives in sentential contexts and
the negative imperative construction are considered.",[129]

Deletion). Other surface verb phrases occur which have two or more
verbs, corresponding to infinitives in many other languages. In
Pipil, they occur juxtaposed, but each bears the subject pronominal
prefixes. Thus, literally ""I went by to see it"" is ""I-passed I-it-
saw."" Some examples are:      1) mu-kwep-ki k-ita tik i-karah. (S-44)
      REFLEX-turnPRET it-see in her-face.
      ""(He) turned around to see her in her face.""      2) panu-k k-ita-k ka ki-tantia nemi ne i-tan. (N-128)
      pass-PRET it-see-PRET it-sharpen is the her-tooth.
      ""(He)went by to see that (she) was sharpening her teeth.""      3) na ni-yaw ni-mu-kwepa ni-k-ilpla. (S-48)
      I I-go I-REFLEX-turn I-it-tie.
      ""I am going to tie her up again.""
                                                                143
   4.19. -chiwa + Spanish infinitive. Often so-called minority
languages, spoken in the social or political setting where some
other language dominates them in power or prestige (usually in
situations involving extensive bilingualism) contain constructions
for employing directly unassimilated forms from the dominant
language. Very often this involves the native verb ""to do"" plus an
infinitive from the dominant language, as is the case of Pali forms
used in Burmese, Arabic loans in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, and of
Chinese borrowings into Japanese, among others. In some of these
languages it is a former contact situation of dominance which has
left its reflexes, although the domination no longer exists.
Spanish verbs are employed in this way in various Mayan languages
and other Indian languages of Mesoamerica. Pipil utilizes -chiwa
""to do"" plus unassimilated Spanish infinitives , which provides
Pipil, in effect, with the richness of Spanish concepts not easily
expressed in Pipil, and allows speakers access to the prestige of
Spanish even in cases where Pipil has perfectly equivalent verbs.
It is also used frequently when the Pipil form is not readily
remembered. Since the Spanish infinitive also functions as a nomi-
nallzation, structurally it is not so strange to see it with -chiwa
""to do"", where it could be thought of as something like, e.g.
 ni-k-chiwa luchâr ""I do fighting"", i.e. ""I fight"". In this con-
struction, the tenses, aspects, pronominal subjects and objects,
reflexives, etc. are born by -chiwa and the Spanish infinitive does
not vary.   While these infinitives are not properly speaking part
of Pipil, they are presented in the examples and in the texts in
the Pipil practical orthography and not in Spanish spelling. Some
examples taken from the texts are the following; for the full
sentential contexts see these texts:   1) mu-chiw-ki proponér (H-6)
   it was proposed (cf. Sp. se propuso)   2) ki-chiw-ki desplumár (H-12)
   (she) plucked it (cf. Sp. lo desplumó)   3) mu-chiw-ke-t afihár (H-13)
   they noticed (cf. Sp. se fijó)   4) ki-chiw-ki kontestár (H-18)
   (he) answered (it) (cf. Sp. lo contestò)   5) mu-chiw-ke-t elebár wan mu-chiw-ke-t desaparesér (U-26)
   REFLEX-do-PRET-PL rise and REFLEX-do~PRET-PL disappear.
   ""They rose and disappeared."" (cf. Sp. elevarse, desaparecerse.)
6) mu-chiw-ke-t hregár (S-l)
they were screwed (cf. Sp. se fregaron)7) nech-chiw-tuk kontár nu-tatanoy (U-32)
tne-do-PERF tell my-grandfather
""my grandfather has told me""8) ni-chiv-ki sentir kal6r (S-13)
I felt hot (cf. Sp. senti calor)9) ki-chiw-ki hwaltár (S-46)
he lacks (cf. Sp. le hace falta, le falta)10) yah mu-chiw-ki arrepentir. (S-47)
he REFLEX-do-PRET repent.
""He regretted (it)."" (Cf. Sp. él se arrepentió.)11) ni-neml ni-k-chiwa luchár. (Ν—31)
Γ-am I-it-do fight.
""Τ am fighting.""

               Pipil-Spanish-English Dictionary
5.0. Introduction       This dictionary covers the two P i p i l dialects which today have
the greatest number of speakers, Cuisnahuat (abbreviated (C)) and
Santo Domingo de Guzmán (signaled by (SD)). Entries are preceded
by either (C) or (SD) to identify the dialect.                      When both dialects
contain a form, the Cuisnahuat version i s l i s t e d f i r s t ( i . e . , in
alphabetical order), followed by the Santo Domingo de Guzmán form.
Material common to the two d i a l e c t s i s presented only in the
Cuisnahuat entry and not repeated f o r the Santo Domingo de Guzmán
version.            Nevertheless, when there are d i f f e r e n c e s , these are
given. Also, occasionally forms from other d i a l e c t s are l i s t e d ,
identified by the name of the dialect before the entry.
       P i p i l words are given with both a Spanish and an English gloss.
The Spanish glosses are given p r i m a r i l y in the l o c a l Spanish of
this part of El Salvador. When this d i f f e r s greatly from standard
Spanish or the variants understood in Guatemala and Mexico, a more
general Spanish translation i s also given, i f i t i s known. In some
instances, mainly in the case of names f o r of wild plants and
animals, local Spanish usage i s a l l that i s known. In such cases,
a b r i e f d e s c r i p t i o n i s given. In a few cases the meaning i s not
secure; these are marked with a question mark in parenthesis, i.e.
( ? ) . In cases where the English name of plants or animals i s not
known, i t i s simply listed with the abbreviation sp. standing f o r
""species"", e.g. ""chichipince"", bush sp. Sometimes various names or
distinct pronunciations of a single name f o r the same thing exist
in the l o c a l Spanish. In such cases, the multiple names and pro-
nunciations are listed in the glosses, with f i r s t priority given to
the names used by my consultants.
      The entries also contain morphological information which i s not
p r e d i c t a b l e or i s otherwise i r r e g u l a r .      In unclear cases, the
syntactic category of the word i s signaled by abbreviations (see
l i s t at the beginning of this book) such as t.v. 'transitive verb',
i . v . ' i n t r a n s i t i v e verb 1 , iij_ 'noun', coni., 'conjunction', e t c . In
146particular, nouns are listed with their plurals (pi.) and possessed
forms (poss.), since these are not predictable. Adjectives are
also often given with their plural forms. Similarly, verb entries
are l i s t e d in the present stems (pres.), but t h e i r p r e t e r i t e
( p r ê t . ) and perfect (perf.) forms are also c i t e d , since these, in
e f f e c t , indicate to which verb c l a s s the entry belongs. Since
these verb forms are not always predictable from knowledge of their
verb class, the actual cases provide additional information beyond
class membership. Other morphemes named in the entries, together
with t h e i r abbreviations, are t a - 'unspecified object', causative
(caus.), a p p l i c a t i v e ( a p p l i c . ) , object incorporation (incorp.),
etc. In particular i t i s important to keep in mind that reflexive
verb forms (abbreviated r . v . ) a r e l i s t e d in the d i c t i o n a r y
according to the r o o t , and not by the prefix mu- which they bear.
Thus, a verb root with both active and reflexive forms has only one
entry, but with forms signaled t.v. ( ' t r a n s i t i v e verb') and r.v.
( ' r e f l e x i v e verb'). Verbs which only appear as r e f l e x i v e s are
given with the mu- prefix, but listed alphabetically according to
the root.
      Forms with a hyphen ( - ) contain a morpheme boundary. Thus, a
hyphen appears between the elements of c e r t a i n compound words.
E n t r i e s with the hyphen at the beginning o b l i g a t o r i l y bear some
other morpheme, a p r e f i x . For example, intimately ( s o - c a l l e d
' i n a l i e n a b l y ' ) possessed nouns do not occur without a possessive
pronominal prefix; the presence of a hyphen shows this. Also, the
absolutive suffix of nouns is separated with a hyphen for greater
clarity. Morphemes which have a special shape in compounds or when
incorporated are c i t e d with t h e i r glosses in single quotes, e.g.
ku:- 'head*. When forms occur which are known only from compounds
but do not appear as such elsewhere, they are given with the gloss
in parentheses, e.g. tankwa- ('knee'). Non-lexical, grammatical
morphemes are also cited in single quotes, while other glosses are
found with no special marking or in double quotes (""..."").","[156, 157, 158, 159, 160]"

3.3. Articles and demonstratives   3.3.1. Articles. The Pipil definite and indefinite articles
correspond roughly in meaning and function to those of Spanish,
although they act a bit more like demonstratives. That is, these

English, and when they are used, they have slightly more demonstra-
tive force. Thus ne ta:ka-t might be translated equally well as
""the man"" or ""that man"" on many occasions. These are:    ne              the

without vowel length.","[70, 71]"
"   The orders:     Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
     Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)also occur, but with less frequency. The order SVO is used speci-
fically to place greater emphasis on the subject. The VSO order is
rare except when the object is ""heavy"", i.e. when it contains a
relative clause or a coordinate noun phrase. In this way Pipil
conforms to the word-order universal that has been postulated for
VOS languages that a ""heavy"" object is not permitted and is usually
shifted to the end, giving VSO with heavy objects as a very common
104corollary order in basically VOS languages (cf. Campbell and Mithun
1981).
   The following are examples of other orders of transitive verb
sentences which have both an overt sujbect and object. The first
two illustrate VSO w i t h ""heavy"" objects. The third and fourth are
cases of VSO with the object bearing emphasis. The final two are
SVO sentences in which the subject is emphasized.","[117, 118]"
"This list shows that there are dialects w h i c h are not of the
Eastern group that have the -me-h / -me-t ending and that there are
Eastern (Isthmus) dialects which lack it (e.g. Boquiapan, Cupilco,
Tuxtlas, etc.).    It is very possible that - m e - h / - m e - t w a s the
original Proto-Nahua plural ending in pronouns, which would mean
that it represents a retention in those dialects that have it, not
a shared innovation. Therefore, these dialects could have retained
the trait regardless of their actual classification by simply not
having changed the prior existing form. In any case, its geogra-
phical distribution shows that this feature is not diagnostic for
the classification of Nahua dialects and has no direct relevance to
the position of Pipil.
   Pipil, the Sierra de Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua also share the
retention of initial      w h i c h changed to ye- in many other dia-
lects, as in, for example, e:-t(l) ""bean"" instead of ye:-t(l). But
certain other dialects also preserve e-, e.g. La Huasteca, Jalisco,
etc., and even in Classical Nahuatl e^ varied w i t h ye. The e^ is a
retention of a Proto-Nhaua characteristic; the change of       to ye-
is a relatively recent innovation. Therefore, Pipil and others
could share    irrespectively of their classification (cf. Canger
1978:8).
   These three, Pipil, Sierra de Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua, also
share another trait, the preservation of the root-final v o w e l in
the words toto(:)nik ""hot"" and xoxo:wik ""green""; cf. CN toto:nki
and xoxo:wki (Canger 1978:8). This attribute is not diagnostic
                                                                931for the classification, either, since La Huasteca Nahua also has it
and, moreover, because it represents a retention of the original
form which could be shared without any historical connection after
the split up of Proto-Nahua. The loss of the root-final vowel
represents an innovation in the dialects which underwent it. In
any case, it is also possible that the Pipil form tutu:nk-a:yu-t
""fever"" evidences the change.
   These three varieties share yet another trait; they have changed
the *tl of Proto-Nahua to _t (cf. Campbell and Langacker 1978), but
this change is so natural that it very easily could have taken
place independently, as is suggested by the fact that a number of
other dialects also share this change (cf. Canger 1980:88-9).
   Canger also pointed out that these three (Pipil, Sierra de
Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua) also tend to lose the absolutive suffix
after     (Canger 1978:13), but the circumstances of this loss vary
in each of the three and also, the same tendency is found in
certain other dialects, e.g. in Tlaxcala Nahua (Canger 1978:13).
In Pipil the absolutive has been lost completely with roots ending
in     but also it tends to be lost in other environments. For
example, one of its allomorphs, -ti, occurs after other consonants
(not -1) but is limited for the most part to monosyllabic forms,
save a few exceptions (see section 3.1.1). In Isthmus Nahua the
absolutive allomorph that occurs after final -1_ (i.e. -li) has
been lost only in polysyllabic nouns, while in Sierra de Puebla
Nahua it was lost in this same environment and also in monosyllabic
nouns with a long vowel. Had the loss of absolutive been histori-
cally shared, the only portion of it that one could assume to be
genetic would be the suppression of the allomorph after root-final
   in polysyllabic forms — but not even this small portion of it
is useful for genetic classification, given that Tlaxcala Nahua
also shares that much of the loss.
   Canger also pointed out traits shared only be Pipil and Isthmus
Nahua. These may be more important, although their significance
for genetic classification is not easily determined. Among these
she cites an Isthmus construction with nemi plus a main verb which
results in a kind of progressive: nemi ni-takwa ""I am eating"". In
Pipil this progressive construction is composed of a clear
auxiliary verb, nemi, which means ""to be"" in other contexts.
However, the constructions meaning and function in Isthmus Nahua
varies with the local dialects. For example, García de León tran-
slates it as ""go (about) doing"" (Sp. andar haciendo) in Pajapan,
Veracruz, where he describes the construction as a ""frase verbal
continuativa"":    nemi mawiltia ""anda jugango"".      El uso de esta frase
932      sustituye en mucho al uso del sufijo continuativo -tok de
      los verbos. (García de León 1976:74)Here it is composed of a verb nemi ""to walk, go"" (andar) plus main
verb (cf. CN nemi ""to live"", nehnemi ""to go, walk""). On the other
hand, Wolgemuth (1980:107) presents it as a true progressive con-
struction, e.g. nemi ni-takwa ""I am eating"". In Pipil, one might
expect a progressive construction from a verb meaning ""to be"", as
is the case in many other languages of the world, e.g. English ""I
am eating"" or Spanish ""estoy comiendo"". Moreover, Isthmus Nahua
has a progressive suffix, -tok, as do several other varieties of
Nahua, which Pipil lacks. Therefore, while Pipil and Isthmus Nahua
share a similarity in this case, it is possible that it is due to
independent innovation of the progressive construction, just as was
the case with English and Spanish, related languages which indepen-
dently developed progressives from forms of the verb ""to be"".
Other dialects also contain auxiliary constructions with nemi, but
with it postposed, e.g. mo-laluhti-nemi ""(he) goes (about) running""
(anda corriendo) in Michoacan Nahua (Beller and Beller 1979:282),
wikati-nemi ""sings habitually"" in La Huasteca Nahua (Sischo
1979:355), while Tetelcingo has an 'ambulative' construction,
-ti-nemi (Brewer 1969:46), to which CN kwala:n-ti-nemi ""to go
(around) getting angry"" (andar enojándose) may be compared. It is
also possible, however, given the greater similarity in form and
meaning, that Pipil and Isthmus Nahua share this trait due to some
common history; at this time, it is simply unclear.
   Canger's second feature shared by Pipil and Isthmus Nahua is
-pal 'possession', e.g. i-pal ""his/hers/its"", no-pal / nu-pal
""mine"", etc. Other dialects have a cognate relational noun -pal,
but generally with the basic meaning of ""by, with, near, by means
of, for"". However, these also have contexts with a possessive
sense, e.g. CN te:-pal ""someone's"" (ajeno). At the same time,
Pipil has contexts with the meaning ""by, for"", e.g. pal ""by, for,
in order to"" (conjunction), ""of, from, by"" (possessive,
directional). It is possible that Pipil and Isthmus Nahua have
innovated together the basic sense of possession, but this is by no
means clear.
   Finally, Canger (1978:14) presented certain lexical items shared
by Pipil and Isthmus Nahua, but these are not shared exclusively by
these two varieties (nor by these plus Sierra de Puebla Nahua).
For example, koyame-t / kuyame-t ""pig"" is found in Pipil, Isthmus
Nahua, Michoacan, and Quetzalapa; others tend to have pitso-t(l).
The form teksis-t(l)i ""egg"" is found in Pipil,      Isthmus,    and
La   Huasteca;    others   have totol-te- t(l). tle-tl. tli-tl, or
                                                                933tlexuch-tli.
   In sum, these similarities may suggest a possible closer genetic
connection between Pipil and Isthmus Nahua (and perhaps these two
with the Sierra de Puebla), but their genetic significance is
inconclusive and Pipil's striking differences (cited above) should
be kept in mind.","[946, 947, 948, 949]"

"   4.1.1. Word order conclusions. To summarize and complete the
picture, Pipil has the word orders:   (1) i.v.-S (basic)
   (2) t.v.-O-S (basic)
   (3) V-S-0 (with ""heavy"" objects;object emphasis)
   (4) S-V-0 (subject emphasis)
   (5) t.v.-S (variant of (2), with object pronominal prefix)
   (6) V-0 (variant of (2), with subject pronominal prefix)
   (7) Pron.S-V(-O) (basic when subject is an independent
           pronoun)
   (8) S-0-Complement (basic; subject may be a noun or
           independent pronoun, complement may be noun or
          adjective)
   (9) Noun Phrase (NP): (Dem)(Adj.)N    (Dem = demonstrative)
           (for examples, cf. chapter 7, texts)
   (10) Verb Phrase (VP): (Adv.) i.v. / t.v. (Adv)(0).
           (Cf. chapter 7, texts, for examples.)   4.1.2. Pronominal indirect objects. As indicated in section
3.2.3, pronominal object prefixes function most often to indicate
direct objects, but signal indirect objects as well. In either
case, the verb may bear only one object prefix. In the case of
indirect pronominal objects, there is often an independent noun
phrase direct object or clear contextual clues as to the pronoun's
role with respect to the verb. It may be that the indirect object
function of these pronominal affixes has been influenced by
Spanish, which like English has the same pronominal forms for both
indirect and direct objects in many cases, e.g. mje pegó ""he hit
me"", me di6 el libro ""he gave me the book"". In cases where both
the direct and indirect object are pronominal, it is usually the
indirect object that is marked on the verb, with the direct object
signaled as a full independent pronoun (cf. 3.5.2). One possible
interpretation of this is that animate cases are given priority,
since usually the indirect objects are animate.   Some examples of
pronominal prefixes as markers of indirect objects are:
110      1) nech-ahkaw-ilih-ke-t tumin.
      me-leave-APPLIC-PRET-PL money.
      ""They left me (the) money.""      2) ni-yu ni-mitsin-raaka se: pwestoh. (R-54)

      ""(To) me myself the old m a n has told me (it)."" = ""The old

"      The most common neutral order for transitive sentences is:         Verb-Object-Subject (VOS)
                                                                103
VOS order is taken as basic because it occurs with the greatest
frequency in texts and conversation, and it is the only order for
transitive sentences which is neutral with respect to focus and
emphasis (see below). This is a relatively rare order in the
world's languages and deviates from the VSO basic order of
Classical Nahuatl and most other extant Nahua dialects. Since
neighboring Xincan and Mayan languages have VOS basic order, one
wonders whether Pipil has been influenced by these in any way (cf.
Campbell 1978).
   A few examples of transitive verbs with both subject and object
are:    1) ki-ta:lih ne i-chaketah ne ta:ka-tsin. (N-23)
    it-place the his-jacket the man-DIMIN.
    ""The little man put down his jacket.""    2) mitsin-maka-tuk ne konse:hoh ne chimpe. (N-121)
    you pl.-give-PERF the advice the youngest son.
    ""The youngest son has given you (pi.) the advice.    3) kin-maka-k pwestoh ne prínsipeh ne se:yuk
    pih-pi:pil-met. (R-56)
    them-give-PRET office the prince the other PL-boy-PL.
    ""The prince gave the other boys (a) position.""    4) ki-chih-ke-t ne ti:-t ne pipil-tsi-tsín. (C)

"   3.7.2.1. Present. The tense traditionally called 'present' in
Pipil covers m o m e n t a n e o u s (e.g. ""I eat (now)""), habitual (""I
(always, characteristically) eat""), and frequently present progres-
sive (""I'm eating"") senses.         It bears no special affixes, although
the root-final vowel is maintained. Transitive verbs very fre-
quently have an - a which signals transitivity, and some transitive
verbs are distinguished from corresponding intransitives solely by
the presence of this -a. The following examples of third person
singular transitive and intransitive forms illustrate this:    Intransitive             Transitive

-tu- 'past participle' plus -lc (probably in origin the 'preterite')
in the singular and    iwi—t in the plural· The —tu— suffix also
occurs in other combinations, e.g.-tu-ya(-t) (cf. section 3.7.6.1)
and -tu-skiya(-t) (cf. section 3.7.2.4.1). The meaning of -tu-k/-
tiwi-t is 'perfect', both 'present perfect' and 'past perfect',
e.g. ni-k-chiw-tuk ""I have done it"", ""I had done it"". It refers to
past action with present relevance. That is, the 'perfect' refers
to an event in the past which has relation to the present
situation.    Its use in the texts of chapter 7 give the best
indication of its meaning and function.   Some examples of its form
are:   Class I
   chiwa   to do,     -chiw-tuk       -chiw-tiwi-t
             make       (he) has done    they have done

   kwi      to take   -kwih-tuk      -kwih-tiwi-t   (The 'past participle1 -tu- combines also with other affixes,
e.g. the 'conditional' and the 'imperfect'; cf. the next section,
3.7.2.4.1 and section 3.7.6.1.)   3.7.2.4. 'Conditional'.     The conditional suffix is -skiya
'singular' and -skiya-t 'plural'. It is normally attached to the
verb root, which is the same as the 'present' stem — that is, the
stem-final vowel is present. However, the verbs of Class III which
end in -ia and -ua in the 'present', -ih and -uh in the 'preterite'
and 'perfect' attach the suffix to the root without the root-final
vowel and also without the ji, e.g. pulua ""to lose"", ni-k-pulu-skiya
Ί would lose it"" (cf. ni-k-pulua ""I lose it"", ni-k-puluh ""I lost
it"", ni-k-puluh-tuk ""I have lost it""). This suffix is called
'conditional' in the literature; it has the approximate meaning of
68""would"" in English. However, speakers at times tend to translate
these forms with the equivalent of ""want"" or ""would like to"". This
'desiderative' connotation may ultimately be due to Spanish
influence, since it is often translated into Spanish with the
subjunctive and Spanish subjunctives can have both the
'conditional' and the 'desiderative' senses. The 'conditional'
paradigm of panu ""to pass"" is:     ni-panu-skiya                   I would pass
     ti-panu-skiya                    you (sg.) would pass
     panu-skiya                      he/she/it would pass
     t i-panu-skiya-t                we would pass
     am-panu-skiya-t (/an-/)         you (pi.) would pass
     panu-skiya-t                    they would pass   3.7.2.4.1.  'perfect conditionals'.     There is also a quite
infrequent 'perfect conditional' composed of -tu- 'past participle'
(cf. -tu-k, -tiwi-t) plus -skiya(-t) 'conditional, with the meaning
""would have"", e.g.:     ahsi-tu-skiya             she would have arrived
     ni-k-taxtah-tu-skiya      I would have paid it
     yah-tu-skiya              he would have gone
     yah-tu-skiya-t            they would have gone
     nl-nemi-skiya ni:kan      I would like to be here
     ke:n ki-chiwa-skiya       How could it be done?
     ni-kwa-skiya              I would like to eat
     ni-k-tu:ka-skiya          I would plant it
     ni-(k-)kuwa-skiya         I would buy it(For conditionals in larger constructions, cf. 4.19.)   3.7.2.5. 'Future'. The future suffixes today in spoken Pipil are
very rare. Usually future meanings are given in periphrastic
constructions, e.g. ni-yu ni-k-chiwa, literally ""I'm going to do
it"". In this, Pipil is very similar to local Spanish, where the
periphrastic forms, e.g. lo voy a hacer (cf. ni-yu ni-k-chiwa) ""I'm
going to do it"" are the most typical, with future forms such as lo
haré (cf. ni-k-chiwa-s) ""I will do it"" rare and stilted. The
Pipil future suffixes are -s^ 'singular' and -s-ke-t 'plural'; they
are similar to the 'conditional' in that normally they are attached
to the verb root ('present' stem) with the final vowel present,
though Class III verbs lack the root-final vowel and the li of other
tenses and aspects, e.g. pulu-ske-t ""they will lose it"" (cf. puluh-
ke-t ""they lost it""). The panu ""to pass"" 'future' paradigm is:
                                                                     69    ni-panu-s                 I wiii pass
    ti-panu-s                 you (sg.) will pass
    panu-s                    (he/she/it)will pass
    ti-panu-ske-t             we will pass
    am-panu-ske-t (/an-/)     you (pi.) will pass
    panu-ske-t                they will passIn Culsnahuat these rare futures are most often found w i t h the
adverbs xa:n ""later, afterwards"" and mu:sta ""tomorrow"", as in:   xa:n ni-k-kwa-s           later I will eat it
   xa:n ti-k-kwa-s           later you will eat it
   xa:n ki-kwa-s             later he/she/it will eat it
   xa:n ti-k-kwa-ske-t       later we will eat it
   xa:n an-ki-kwa-ske-t      later you (pi.) will eat it
   xa:n ki-kwa-ske-t         later they will eat it   mu:sta ti-k-kwa-s nakatamal     tomorrow you will eat tamales
   yaha rau:sta ki-kwa-s nakatamal tomorrow he will eat tamales
   mu:sta ti-ya-s                   tomorrow you will go
   mu:sta ya-s                      tomorrow he will go   3.7.2.6. 'Desiderative 1 . Pipil has a 'desiderative' composed
of 'future' - s plus neki, historically from the verb root ""to
want"". It has the form: pronouns+verb+s+neki(+plural).   The con-
struction means ""to want to do the action expressed by the verb"".
Some examples are:   naha ni-k-kwa-s-neki             I want to eat it
   taha ti-k-kwa-s-neki             you (sg.) want to eat it
   yaha ki-kwa-s-neki               he/she wants to eat it
   tehemet ti-k-kwa-s-neki-t        we want to eat it
   an-ehemet an-ki-kwa-s-neki-t     you (pi.) want to eat it
   yehemet ki-kwa-s-neki-t          they want to eat it   3.7.2.7. 'Imperfect'.       The suffix - y a 'imperfect' indicates
continuous past actions, best translated into English as ""used to
do"" or ""was doing"" the action of the verb. It is equivalent to the
Spanish 'imperfect past' which ends in - i a or - a b a , e.g. c o m i a
""(she) was eating"", c a m i n a b a ""(he) used to walk"". It is employed
rather seldom in present-day Pipil. Some examples are:
70     ni-tawi:kilia-ya     I owed (him money for some time)
     ki-na:maka-ya         he used to sell/was selling it   3.7.2.7.1. -tu-ya 'past imperfect'.    The suffix -tu-ya is
exceedingly rare in today's usage. It is composed of the 'past
participle' -tu- (cf. -tu-k, -tiwi-t, section 3.7.2.3) plus the
'imperfect' -ya. It essentially means an action which continued in
the past but is now ended, e.g.:      ni-k-ltskih-tu-ya    I had been grabbing it
      ni-k-chiw-tu-ya      I had been doing it
      ti-k-chiw-tu-ya      we used to be doing itIt should be noted that the 'imperfect' is distinct from the clitic
-a/-ya ""already, now"", and should not be confused with it (cf.
section 3.8.1).","[79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84]"

   3.1.3.4. -ta(:)l. Pipil has a suffix which seems to be derived
from the root ta:l ""land"": its basic meaning seems to be ""place of
many"" of the things named by the noun root to which it is attached.
It corresponds to the Spanish suffix -al. -ar (e.g. platanal
""plantain grove"" (cf. plátano ""plantain""), piñal ""pine grove"" (cf.
pino ""pine""), frijolar ""bean patch"" (cf. frijol ""bean""), carrizal
""canebrake"" (cf. carrizo ""cane, reed""), cafetal ""coffee orchard"",
etc. It is possible that the meaning and perhaps even the origin
of this suffix has been influence by this Spanish case, given that
other Nahua varieties are not known to have such an ending. Forms
with this suffix are:     a:ka-tal   canebrake, place of reeds      (a:ka- ""reed"")
     a:ma-tal   many amate trees/paper          (a:ma- ""amate"")
     e:-tal     bean patch, bean field          (e:- ""bean"")
     saka-tal   pasture                        (saka- ""grass"")
     te-tá:l,   rocky place                    (te- ""stone"")
       tetal
     tewti-tá:l dusty ground                    (tew-ti ""dust"")

     wa:k-ta:1    dry ground                    (wa(:)ki ""dry"")   3.1.3.5. -ka. Pipil has some nouns which are derived from
verbs or adjectives by means of the suffix -ka. In other varieties
of Nahua this suffix, in addition to being a nominalizer, is re-
lated to the 'perfect' and the 'remote past'. Nevertheless, Pipil
has no 'remote past' and its 'perfect' forms do not include -ka.
Noun roots that take this suffix undergo vowel-loss (see section
2.2, rule 1). The following show it:     cha:mah-ka    waist          (cha:mawak ""thick"")
     i:xpil-ka     squatting      (i:xpilua ""to sqat"")

                                                                   49   Another very restricted suffix, which appears to be related to
this -ka. is the locative ending -kan. The few examples are:  ta-we:y-kan   country(side) (cf. we:y ""big"")
  ta-ne:s-kan   dawn, clearing (cf. ne:si ""to appear"")
  yeh-kan       alone, to the right (ye:k ""good"" (?))   3.1.3.6. -ni. The 'agentive' suffix -ni derives nouns from
verbs with the meaning of ""one who does the action of the verb"".
Some examples are:  atsakwa-ni       azacuan bird   (a:- ""water"" + tsakwa ""to cover"";
                                      literally ""water-coverer"")
  ehku-ni        ladino,          (ehku- ""to arrive"")
                   foreigner
  kuchi-ni       sleepy-head      (kuchi- ""to sleep"")
  kukuya-ni      sick person      (kukuya- ""to get sick"")
  ma:wiltiaya-ni playful person   (m-a:wiltia ""to play"")
  miki-ni        dead person      (miki- ""to die"")
  tacha-ni       lizard sp.       (ta-chiya- ""to look"")
  takwi:ka-ni    singer           (takwi:ka- ""to sing"")
  tapahtiya-ni   curer            (ta-pah-tia ""to cure"")
  tapa:ka-ni     washer woman     (ta-pa:ka- ""to wash"")
  tatu:ka-ni     planter, sower   (ta-tu:ka- ""to plant"")
  tatsa:wa-ni    weaver           (ta-tsa:wa- ""to weave"")
   3.1.3.7. -s. (-lis, - w i s , -was). The -s, suffix also derives
nouns from verbs, nouns which reflect the activity of the verb. It
is no longer productive, and Pipil has few examples:   tacha-li-s         appearance (ta-chiya ""to look"")
   yuyumuka-li-s     foot fungus (yuyumuka ""to itch"")
   kuku-li-s          sickness   (kuku-ya ""toget sick"")
   a:xa:l-uwa-s      whetstone   (cf. a:xa:l ""sand"")
   ku:-panu-wa-s     bridge       (ku:- 'wood'+ panu- ""to pass"")
   kwahsiwi-s        gumption
   taxwi:-s          pimple      (ta- + ixwi ""to fill"")
   tepu:na-wa-s      drum        (cf. pu:ni ""to burst"" ?)
   tsi:ku-wa-s       comb        (tsikwastia ""to comb"")
   uchpa:n-wa-s      broom       ((u)chpa:na ""to sweep"")   3.1.3.8. -tsin. The suffix -tsin is productive and has a
'diminutive' or 'reverential' function. In some words this suffix
bears the stress even though it may not be the penultimate
syllable. Also, it is pronounced at times as -chin instead of the
50expected    -tsin.   In plural     forms it Is       reduplicated,
tsintsin in many of the dialects, but -tsitsin in Cuisnahuat. Some
examples are:     a:yu:-tsin        turtle
     cha:kwah-tsin     storage hook
     chapa-chin        short(y)       mistun-tsin    kitten
     chihchipi:n-tsin chichipince     muluk-tsin     feline sp.

     iknu-tsin         orphan         na:na:wa-tsin El Chimpe
     ihyu:mlk-tsin     ""El Duende""    na:n-tsin      mother
     i:xpupuyu:-tsin   cutworm        nek-tsin       anteater
     i:xkipi-tsin      firefly        pa:pa:lu-tsin butterfly
     ka:mah-tsin       cradle         perikuh-chin parrekeet
     kamanan-tsin      dimples        pil-tsin       boy, son
     ku:kulu-tsin      dove sp.       pipil-tsin     little boy

     ku:pitsak-tsin    skinny          se:-chin     unique
     ku:talalah-tsin   lizard sp.     swa:beh-chin whisper
     ku:ti-tsin        fire           takwatsin      opossum
     kwikwil-tsin      motley         tu-na:n-tsin Virgin Mary
     kwitawululuh-tsin scarab         tu-tah-tsin    Jesus Christ
     lamah-tsin        old woman      tsapa-tsin     short(y)
     liklik-tsin       small hawk     ustu-tsin      bobcat
     masa:-tsin        little deer    wi:lu-tsin     small bird

     ma:-tsi-tsin      crab's feet    xu:re:-tsin    old man   3.1.3.9. -pil. Pipil has another 'diminutive' suffix, -pil,
which is not productive and occurs with few nouns. Its plural is
-pipil in Cuisnahuat and -pilpil in other locations. The examples
are:     iknu-pil       orphan
     -kwitapil      tail (cf. kwita-t ""excrement"")
     -nenepil       tongue
     siwa:-pil      girl (cf. siwa:-t ""woman"")   3.1.3.10. -1_ 'passive nominalization'. Many nouns are derived
from passive verbs with the suffix           resulting in passive
nominalizations, for example ta-kwa-1 ""food"", from ta-kwa ""to
eat"" + —_1 'passive nominalization'; or ta-xka-1 ""rigua, tortilla"",
from ta- 'something' + (i)xka ""to roast"", literally ""something
roasted"". Note that frequently nouns derived from verbs bear ta-
'unspecified object 1 (see section 3.3.4.4.). For more details on
passivization, see section 3.8.3.
                                                                 51   3.1.4. 'Plural'. Pluralization of nouns in Pipil is somewhat
complicated not only by the fact that there are several different
ways to form the plural, but also because some nouns take a combi-
nation of plural markers. The most common elements in plural
formations are reduplication (see below) and the suffix -t
'plural', also found in plural verb forms. Core Nahua has changed
this -t_ 'plural' to -ji or   thus Pipil is conservative in main-
taining this trait. The various plural markers are now taken up
individually.   (1) -ket is the most restricted plural marker, limited to a very
few human nouns:    lamat-ket,
      lah-lamat-ket      old women
    sih-siwa:t-ket       women
    xuh-xu:ret-ket       old men
    ukich-ket            males, men, husbands   (2) -me-t occurs with a larger, though still very limited
number of nouns; these are also, with few exceptions, 'human'
nouns:    ahsi:1-met               nits
    ah-alma-met              souls
    ah-alwa: si :1-me t      constables, policemen
    ehkuni-met               ladinos
    lah-lamah-tsi-tsin-met, little old women
      lah-lamah-chi-chin-met
    —ma :n—me t              brothers
    nah-na:n-met             mothers
    peh-pe:lu-met            dogs
    pipil-met                boys
    tah-ta:ka-met            men
    tixkwi-met               lazy persons
    tsih-tsinnanats-met      women with large buttocks
    uh-ukich-met             males, men
    xuh-xu:lu-met            babies   (3) -wan, as indicated above (31.2.1), is the plural of w
'possession' and is limited to a few kinship terms (which are in
character 'intimately' possessed).
52
   (A) -tsi(n)tsin (see section 3.1.3.8.) ) is the plural of the

Mesoamerican linguists bear possessive pronominal prefixes on what
is in origin and still in form a noun root; that is, these loca-
tives look like possessed nouns. This trait is found in nearly all

strated here in the paradigms for - w a n ""with"" and (i)hpak ""on"":     nu-wan     with me           nu-hpak   on me

function as adjectives with the sense of ""to be"" are:    se:n-kak        to be together (cf. se:(η) ""one, together"")
    mu-ets-tuk (C), to be seated
     mu-es-tuk (SD)

4.16); other nemi constructions include its auxiliary function in
'progressives' (see 4.20.1). (Cf. also the -ti 'inchoative'
suffix, 3.7.8.3.3.)
4.3. Non-distinct arguments   The concept of non-distinctness refers to transitive sentences
in which the subject and direct object are either coreferential or
one of these arguments (subject or direct object) is not specified.
The kinds of 'non-distinct' arguments are passives, reflexives,
impersonale, and unspecified direct-object markers (cf. Langacker
1977:46-8). Many of these forms were already considered in the
morphology (chapter 3); for 'reflexives' (-mu-) cf. 3.7.4.1, for
the 'unspecified object' markers, see 3.7.4.2. (both te:- human and
ta- nonhuman); passive verb morphology (-lu-, -ua) was treated in
3.7.8.4.
   There is also an impersonal construction formed of 'third
personal plural' verbs (i.e. with the suffix -t) where the subject
is not otherwise specified, meaning, e.g. ""fish are eaten in
Japan"", that is equivalent to English ""they"" in ""they eat fish in
Japan"". For example:    1) nech-tawilih-ke-t ne pe:lu.
    me-give-PRET-PL the dog.
    ""They gave me the dog."" - ""I was given the dog.""   2) de mala swerte ki-mu:tia-t.

   ""Unfortunately they frightened him."" • ""Unfortunately, he
   was frightened.""

      hira-tell-PRET-PL that her-smear chili.

"    1.4. Pipil dialectology. Having considered Pipil's ethnohis-
tory and its position relative to other varieties of Nahua, I now
turn to an inspection of Pipil's own regional variation. My origi-
nal intent in studying Pipil dialects was to determine where the
language is still spoken and to obtain a general characterizataion
of local dialect variation. The goal was not to provide an exhaus-
tive account of minor regional differences. The dialect features
presented here, then, give a good idea of major differences among
local dialects, but it does not provide a comprehensive view of
variation within each location. These dialect traits are presented
in broad phonetic representation, not really phonemic, but
employing the Pipil practical alphabet to the extent that it is
possible (see section 2.1).
   (1) In Chiltiupán _ts tends to change to s, e.g. saput ""Zapote""
(from tsaput; susukul ""water jug (cántaro)"" (from tsutsukul); etc.
   (2) In Concepción de Ataco the vowels i^ and ii have been lost
between stops and semivowels, e.g. kwat ""snake""(from ku(;)wat),
kwa ""to buy"" (from kuwa). maltyá ""to bathe"" (from m-a(:)lti(y)a;
the χ is inserted by rule, cf. 2.2). It should also be noticed
that the lost vowel would ordinarily bear stress when in penulti-
mate position and consequently stress is shifted to the final
vowel.
   (3) Originally the final and preconsonantal -1_ of Pipil (and
probably of Proto-Nahua as well) was devoiced (1), but today there
is considerable variation between voiced and voiceless pro-
nunciation in these position and even in other positions in certain
dialects. In Cuisnahuat the voiced and voiceless counterparts vary
rather freely in final position. Final -1 is always voiceless in
Jicalapa. In Teotepeque, the voiceless 1 (1) has been generalized
to all positions; that is, ¿ has changed totally to    everywhere,
e.g. peíu ""dog"", tihian ""chicken"", tekutut ""owl"", kumat ""griddle"",
chiitik ""red"", maitiya ""to bathe"", kai ""house"", etc.
   In Jicalapa, not only is final         devoiced, but 1_ in all
positions is palatalized, lj, prepalatalized finally,          Some
14exampales are: pel^u ""dog"", tihlyan ""chicken"", tekulyut ""owl"",
chakalyin ""shrimp"", el^ut ""ear of corn"", ul y ut ""corncob"", kumayl·
""griddle"", taxka^i ""tortilla"", tuna^t ""sun"", Imamat ""old woman"",
ka?l· ""house"", etc.
   (4) In Teotepeque χ (/δ/) has changed to / V , a retroflexed
fricative, and now is in free variation with rr (/?/). I believe
the later change to rr. is due to Spanish influence. There is
sociolinguistically conditioned variation in local Spanish between
r and '·è, where at least nearby in Guatemala the s   · variant is
stigmatized. I believe that the negative value placed on this
variant in Spanish has contributed to the Teotepeque change to r, a
change in the direction of the prestige variant in Spanish, the
dominant language in this setting. Some examples are:      Suchit /
ruchit ""flower"", suiet / rul-et ""old man"", teskan ""tick1', sukut
""hogplum"", a'san ""now"".
   (5)Teotepeque and Comasaguya have a before ¿ in monosyllabic
roots where others dialects have e¿ e.g. -may ""hand"", -kway
""skirt"".
   (6) Pipil k has several variants in the different dialects, but
in every case the underlying segment remains Je. In Cuisnahuat Jc is
voiced and sometimes fricativized ¿ between two vowels when the
first is long or if both are ji's. Occasionally it is voiced ini-
tially in certain words, particulary frequent with k(i)~ 'third
person sg. pronominal' prefix.     In Santo Domingo de Guzmán k is
voiced    initially, intervocalically, and after n. In Tacuba,
it is voiced between vowels. In the other dialects Jc is generally
maintained without change.
   In all dialects, final η is velar (g) and the stress falls on
the penultimate syllable except for certain Spanish loans,
occasionally the suffix -tsin (cf. section 3.1.3.8), and those
words in Ataco which lost penultimate i. or ji between stops and
semivowels (see above).
   Vowel length is not represented in the list of dialect forms
that follows due to lack of reliable information except for
Cuisnahuat and Santo Domingo de Guzmán, where it was investigated
systematically . It is to be supposed, however, that vowel length
in the other dialects, where it still exists, will be nearly the
same as in these two dialects.
   The following word lists exemplify the changes and variation in
the individual dialects. The abbreviations are:

we turn to the other pronominal a f f i x e s that occur with verbs.
                                                                 75     3.7.4.1. 'Reflexive' (mu-). By the notion ""reflexive"" one does
not usually understand a pronominal form, but the 'reflexive'
m o r p h e m e s in Nahua have typically been treated as pronominal
because in central Mexican dialects they pattern with other prono-
minal prefixes and vary according to person. The 'reflexive'
morpheme of Pipil is mu- with all persons. Its phonological shape
is normally mu in all contexts, including before vowels, where it
is phonetically (muw-) alternating freely with (mw-) is faster
speech. However, there are a few prevocalic cases where it is
simply m - (see 2.2). Some of these appear to have the m - fused as
part of the root and it is no longer recognized as the historical
reflexive that lies behind it. Nevertheless, in these cases there
exist other derivations which show the root without the otherwise
frozen reflexive.          (See below; cf. section 2.2.) Example of
preconsonantal and prevocalic 'reflexive' paradigms are:
       ni-mu-ta:lia        I sit (literally ""I place myself"")
       ti-mu-ta:lia        you (sg.) sit
       mu-ta:lia           he/she/it sits
    ti-mu-ta:lia-t   we sit
    an-mu-ta:lia-t   you (pi.) sit
    mu-ta:lia-t      they sit    ni-mu-a:paka     I wash myself
    ti-mu-a:paka     you (sg.) wash yourself
    mu-a:paka        he/she/it washes hlm-/her-/itself
    ti-mu-a:paka-t   we wash ourselves
    an-mu-a:paka-t   you (pi.) wash yourselves
    mu-a:paka-t      they wash themselvesSome additional examples of reflexive verbs are:   mu-a:pachua       to throw oneself in the water
   mu-chayuntia       to swing
   mu-i:xraimilua     to roll
   mu-i:xmu:tia       to be frightened, afraid
   mu-i:xpa:ka        to wash one's face
   mu-kxi-pa:ka       to wash one's feet
   mu-machtia          to learn (i.e. to teach oneself)
   mu-na:miktia       to get married
   mu-ne:xtia         to show oneself
   mu-sewi            to rest
   mu-tahkwiltia      to braid (one's hair)
   mu-ta:lua          to run
   mu-tapatia         to dress, change clothes
76     mu-ta: sa                 to bump into
     mu-ta:wa:ntia             to get drunk
     mu-techtia                to be sad, become sad
     mu-te:ka                  to lie down
     mu-tu :nalwia             to sun oneself
     mu-tsinta:lia             to squat
     mu-wawana                 to scratch oneselfA few examples of the prevocalic jn- allomorph, together                   with
related non-reflexive forms, are:     m-a:ltia     to bathe (oneself)            k-altia    to bathe
     m-a:wiltia   to play                       k-a:wiltia to paly it
     m-ihtutia    to dance                      k-ihtutia to dance it
     m-i:naya     to hide (oneself)             k-i:naya   to hide it
     m-ihkwani    to remove (self)              k-ihkwani to remove it
     m-isu :tia   to vomit
     m-itu:ni(ya) to sweatA few verbs which are reflexive in form have developed specialized
senses :     m u - c h i w a to grow       (from c h i w a ""tamake"")
     mu-neki         to need       (from neki ""to want"")There is one suppletive form with mu-, derived from a verb but used
as an adjective: mu-e(t)s-tuk ""seated, sitting"".
   With respect to the order of verbal prefixes, subject pronomi-
nale precede mu-, but the object pronominal prefixes and the
reflexive are mutually exclusive, both occupying the ""object""
position.    I n the f e w c a s e s of v e r b s w h i c h b e a r b o t h t h e
'reflexive* and either the (w)al- 'directional' or -el- 'mentation/
inside' (see below) prefixes, the 'reflexive' follows these, e.g.:     (w)al-mu-ne:lwia            to hurry
     el-mu-yawa                  to be nauseated(Cf. 2.2 and 3.7.6.1.)     In the dictionary (chapter 5) reflexive verbs are not listed
independently (under mu- , but rather are found under the verb root
w i t h the abbreviation r.v. to indicate that the root occurs w i t h
the reflexive morpheme.
                                                                77   3.7.4.2. ta- 'unspecified object 1 . In addition to the object
pronominal prefixes already presented, Pipil has another which is
employed to show that the (non-human) object of a transitive verb
is not specified. Verbs with this prefix, ta-, are translated with
an object ""something"" or ""to be doing"" whatever the action of the
verb is, without specifying what the object of the action is; cf.
ni-ta-hkwilua ""I a m      writing"" or ""I write (something)"" /
ni-k-ihkwilua ""I write it"". For example, ta- forms are much used
for answering the question, ""what are you doing?""; the answer might
be, for example, ni-ta-istawia ""I'm salting"".         That is, the
'unspecified object' ta- is natural in contexts where the action of
the verb is in focus and the object is of little relevance, as seen
in these forms:   ni-ta-u:ya                     I am shelling (corn)
     (cf. ni-k-u: ya ""I shell it"")
   ni-ta-ilpia                    I am tying
     (cf. ni-k-ilpia ""I tie it"")
   ni-ta-ku:taraima               I throw something
     (cf. ki-ku:tamima ""he throws it"")Some instances of verbs with ta- are:   ta-chalua        to hit, beat
   ta-chichina      to smoke
   ta-chihcha       to spit
   ta-chiya         to look
   ta-chteki        to steal (cf. k-ichteki ""to steal it"")
   ta-hkwilua       to write (cf. k-ihkwllua ""to write it"")
   ta-hseki         to toast (cf. k-ihseki ""to toast it"")
   ta-htsuma        to sew (cf. k-ihtsuma ""to sew it"")
   ta-ihxihxi: ma   to scrape
   ta-ilpia         to tie
   ta-iskalia       to raise, grow
   ta-istawia       to salt
   ta-(i)xi:ka      to drip

verbs the ta- prefix is no longer optional, but has become a frozen
part of the verb root. Normally, verbs with ta- as the unspecified
object do not permit the simultaneous occurrence of k(i)~, the
'third person singular pronominal object 1 prefix. However, the
verbs with frozen ta- do take the k(i)~ object marker.     In other
cases the optional ta- prefix is added, but either with specialized
semantic senses or irregular phonological outcomes.            Some
instances of both kinds are:     tah-a:na         to pick up (cf. a:na ""to pick up"")
     ta-chpa:na (C)   to sweep (cf. uchpa:na ""to sweep"";

with iterative verbs or with plural objects, e.g.:     tah-ta-chiya     to look a lot, to have fun

c a t i o n that verbs p a r t i c i p a t e in.       Both r e d u p l i c a t e the i n i t i a l

means ""hither"", i.e. motion toward the speaker or toward where the
action of the verb takes place. It is derived historically from
wa:lah ""to come"" ('preterite' form). The allomorph w a l - appears
only if no other prefix precedes it; otherwise, the -al- allomorph
occurs. Also, this is the only prefix before which all the subject
pronominal prefixes lose their final vowel, if they have one, e.g.:
    n-al-kl:xtia      I remove it
    t-al-ki:xtia      you (sg.) remove it
    k-al-ki:xtia      he/she/it removes it
    t-al-ki:xtia-t    we remove it
    an-al-ki:xtia-t   you (pi.) remove it
    k-al-ki:xtia-t    they remove it
Some verbs with this prefix, compared to their counterparts without
it, are:    (w)al-ahsi        to find          ahsi       to arrive
    (w)al-a:na        to bring         a:na       to pick up

ductive and few examples of it exist, but it appears to mean appro-
ximately ""perception by the senses"", that is, mental or emotional
acts, or ""inside"". It appears with verb roots, but also with other
categories as well:     el-ka:wa           to forget (ka:wa ""to leave, abandon"")

     -el-tapach        liver   3.7.6.3. - a h - 'buccal'. Pipil has forms which suggest another
non-productive verbal prefix now frozen as part of the root, which
probably meant acts done w i t h the mouth, although today this
meaning is far from clear. It also occurs with some non-verbal
forms. The examples are:      ahkamacha:lua     to yawn (cf. ka:machalua (SD) ""to yawn"")
      ahka:na           to blow, fan
                                                                     83    ahketsawetsi      to fall mouth upward (i.e., on one's back;
                         cf. wetsi ""to fall"")
    ahkwe:chiwi       to sneeze (cf. kwe:chiwi ""to be insect-eaten"")

                         cf. CN wawaloa ""to bark"")
   ahwa-t             chaff (that which is blown on to rid it
                         from rice, beans, grain, etc.)
    ahwiya-k          delicious   3.7.6.4.  - i h - 'superperficial'. There is evidence of yet
another non-productive, frozen, and rare verb prefix, -ih-, which
seems to have something to do with the surface of objects. Tt also
is not limited to verbs. The examples are:    ihchiki           to scrub
    ihiya             to hate
    ihkwilua           to write (cf. kwikwil- ""colored"")

""instrumental prefixes"", but much less extensively than some other
Uto-Aztecan languages. The instrumental prefix is basically an
incorporated noun, usually a body-part term, w h i c h semantically
signals the instrument by which the action of the verb is realized.
These have been called instrumental prefixes because in some lan-
guages the incorporated elements appear in a changed, abbreviated
form s o m e w h a t different from the full nouns from w h i c h they are
derived. (Pipil also has such changed forms, but with incorporated
objects, rather than these instrumental f o r m s (see below).) The
few examples appear to be frozen; they are:     1) tan-kwa             to bite (tan- ""tooth"", kwa ""to eat"")
     2) mu-tankwa-ketsa     to kneel (tankwa ('knee'), ketsa

                              ""foot"", ahsi to ""arrive, find"")
     4) kwa:ch-ki:xtia      to strain, sift (kwa:ch- ""cloth"",
                              ki:xtia ""to take out"")
     5) te-tsikwini         to cross the river on rocks (te-
                              ""rock"", tsikwini ""to jump"")
     6) mu-tu:nal-tatia     to sun (tu:nal ""sun"", tatia ""to burn"")
                                                                 97   3.7.10.3. Object incorporation. Like other Uto-Aztecan and many
native American languages, Nahua varieties can incorporate an ob-
ject noun directly into the verb. Such incorporated objects have a
generic or non-specific sense. English does not really have this
kind of incorporation, but examples such as ¿o proofread (read
proof), to babysit (sit babies), to deerhunt(?) (hunt deer), and to
barhop (hop bars) give a good idea of the construction. In Pipil
it is no longer productive and most of the forms are frozen; for
that reason, some examples were included in the section on verb
compounds (cf. 4.6.2). The most common are the cases with a body-
part term incorporated. Cases in which the incorporated element
occurs in a special form different from its independent nominal
counterpart are signaled by single quotes ('...') which otherwise
are employed to mark grammatical elements as opposed to lexical
material (marked with double quotes (""..."")).
  Some examples with regular incorporated nouns are:   a:raa-ita              to read (a:ma- ""book"", ita ""tosee"")
   ich-ma:linl (SD)     to twist string (ich ""string"", ma:lini

    i:x-kukul-ita       to give the ""evil eye"" (i:x ""eye"",
                          -kukul- ita ""to see"")

   mu-kal-tapa:na
                          ""house"", taparna ""to break open"")

                        to split firewood (ku:- 'wood',

"   Intransitive sentences, on the other hand, rarely deviate from
the basic Verb-Subject (VS) order. The combination Verb-Object
(VO) is found often in transitive sentences in which the subject is
pronominal and hence signaled by a verb prefix. Similarly, the
order Verb-Subject (VS) also occurs in transitive sentences w h e n
the object is pronominal and marked with prefixes on the verb.
   A few examples of verb-initial transitive sentences which lack
independent subjects or objects, these being signaled by pronominal
prefixes, are:      1) VO: ki-chiw-ki ne komidah. (H-12)
      it-made-PRET the food.
      ""She made the food.""

2) VO: kiya né: ki-wi:ka-ke-t ne siwa:pil. (H-29)
thus there her-take-PRET-PL the girl.
""Thus they took the girl there.""","[118, 119]"
"   4.18. Complex verb phrases. Pipil has other constructions in
which two (or more) verbs occur together within the same (surface-
structure) verb phrase in constructions which would correspond to
infinitival forms in English or Spanish (i.e. sentences which have
undergone Equivalent Noun-Phrase Deletion, see below). Within this
more general class of juxtaposed verb forms, three verbs (wiîts ""to
come"", ki:sa ""to leave"", and -neki ""to want"") have a function
intermediate between full, main verbs and auxiliaries. They a r e
best apprehended from examples.

/h/ ( v o i c e l e s s g l o t t a l f r i c a t i v e ) , as in E n g l i s h house. Vowels
have e s s e n t i a l l y the same value as the corresponding vowels of
Spanish, although there i s in a d d i t i o n a length c o n t r a s t . The
vowels jj and             can vary f r e e l y in their phonetic realization among
u(:), U(:), and o ( : ) , but ji and uj_ a r e by f a r the most frequent and
common pronunciations. The e_ varies in a very few cases with                                            in
less           careful       speech, e.g. ne / ni ' d e f i n i t e a r t i c l e ' , - n e c h - /
-nich- ""me"" ( ' f i r s t person singlular object pronoun'), etc.
      Vowel length i s an important c o n t r a s t , but i t i s d i f f i c u l t to
determine in many cases. There are such minimal pairs as pa;ta ""to
melt"" / pata ""to change""; ne: "" t h e r e "" / ne ' d e f i n i t e a r t i c l e ' ; the
roots m e : t s - ""moon"" / mets- "" t h i g h "" ; e t c . , but such p a i r s are not
f r e q u e n t . The d i f f i c u l t y i s t h a t , due to P i p i l ' s moribund s t a t e ,
many speakers no longer make the vowel-length contrast, or they do
i t only in more f o r m a l c o n t e x t s . Among my main c o n s u l t a n t s in
Cuisnahuat, one lacked the contrast altogether, another had i t only
in formal contexts (for example when c a r e f u l l y comparing l i n g u i s t i c
forms, reciting word l i s t s , etc.), and a third used i t consistently
throughout his speech. In Santo Domingo de Guzmán my consultants
generally lacked the contrast in everyday speech, but were able to
produce the d i s t i n c t i o n s when queried about i n d i v i d u a l words.
Nevertheless, only two individuals there maintained the distinction
consistently in a way r e l a t i v e l y easy to perceive.
       In both dialects the léngth contrast i s clear only in stressed
s y l l a b l e s , i.e. the penultimate, in most forms. Notwithstanding,
in many cases d i f f e r e n t s y l l a b l e s may be stressed in derivations
with v a r i e d p r e f i x e s or s u f f i x e s , e.g. / m a s a : - t / ( m á s a t ) "" d e e r "" .
/ m a s a : - t s i n / ( m a s á r t s i g ) "" l i t t l e deer""; / t e : l p u : c h / ( t é : l p u c h )
""son"", / t e : l p u : c h - t s i n / ( t e l p ú r c h t s i g ) "" l i t t l e son""; /tekuma-t/
(tekúmat) ""bottle gourd"", /nu-tekun/ (nutékug) ""my b o t t l e gourd"",
/ t e k u m a - t s i n / (tekumátsirj) "" l i t t l e bottle gourd"" (""tecomatillo"");
etc. (These examples are cited from Cuisnahuat dialect).
      In Cuisnahuat a l l w o r d - i n i t i a l vowels a r e p h o n e t i c a l l y long,
although those followed by a single consonant are longer than those
f o l l o w e d by two, e.g. / i : s a / ( i : s a ) ""to wake up"", / u l u - t / ( u : l u t )
""corncob"", / i s t a - t / ( i ' s t a t ) "" s a l t "" . Underlying vowel length can
be determined in such forms by f i n d i n g the form with some p r e f i x
which removes the vowel from word-initial position, e.g. /uh-ulu-t/
(uhúlut) ""corncobs"", /nu-ulu/ (nu(w)úlu) ""my corncob"",                                   /n-i:sa-k/
( n i : s a k ) "" I woke up"". Santo Domingo de Guzmán has undergone c e r -
t a i n changes with r e s p e c t to vowel length in t r i s y l l a b i c words,
p a r t i c u l a r l y verbs. With V to r e p r e s e n t a s y l l a b l e , forms with
V..tf:..V have changed to                                in many c a s e s .
26     In the f i n a l a n a l y s i s , although I did a l l I could to determine
underlying vowel length a c c u r a t e l y f o r each of the forms of the
d i c t i o n a r y , many c a s e s remain in which vowel length i s simply
uncertain. The marking of length i s much more secure in stressed
syllables and in frequently occurring words.","[38, 39, 40]"
"This order frequently does not permit derivationally related forms
to be l i s t e d in adjacent e n t r i e s . However, t h i s i s no problem,
since r e l a t e d forms contain c r o s s - r e f e r e n c e s which indicate the
derived forms and where to look for them.

"   3.2.2. Pronominal subject affixes. Verbs take pronominal a f -
fixes which either indicate the pronominal subject (if no indepen-
dent subject pronouns, nouns, or noun phrases occur) or mark a
cross-reference to independent subjects (see section 3.7.4). These
prefixes co-occur w i t h the plural suffix -t_ on the verb when the
subject is a plural person. The subject pronminal affixes, then,
are:     ni-
     ti-              you (singular)
     0-               he/she/it

   Brinton's evidence for identifying AlagUilac (Palacio's
Tlacacebastleca) as Pipil included a short word list collected by
Bromowicz in 1878 (published in Lehmann 1920:1062-7) and four
manuscript pages dating from 1610 to 1637 written in Nahuatl and
found in the Parrish archives of San Agustin Acasaguastlan. From
these Brlnton concluded that ""Alagüilac was a quite pure form of
the Nahuatl"" (Brinton 1887:376), closely related to the Pipil of
Escuintla (p.377). These data, however, do not warrant such con-
clusions. The list of words (cf. section 2) was from San Agustin
Acasaguastlan, the town identified in the colonial sources as
""Mexican"" and not AlaglÜlac in speech. Below it will become clear
that this ""Mexican"" indeed owes its origin to people from central
Mexico and has no special connection to Pipil. Futhermore, the
manuscript pages were written in Nahuatl, a central Mexican dialect
of Nahua. Por example, they contain forms with /tl/, which exists
only in dialects originally connected to central Mexico — Pipil
has only /t/, no /tl/. Some cases are:    ictle       good""           (CN ye:k-tli)

                                  bring about marriages"")
    matlacti-   ""ten""           (CN ma'tlak-)It should be noted that Lehmann (1920:1061) also rejected Brinton's
identification, pointing to similar examples.
   There are at least two possible explanations of how the Mexican
dialect of Nahua registered in the four manuscript pages could come
to be in Acasaguastlan. One has to do with the fact that in New
Spain starting in 1570 the official policy was to make Nahuatl the
general language and no priest who did not know Nahuatl could take
charge of the missions or parishes (Heath 1972:27). This could
explain the Nahuatl fround in Acasaguastlan and in many other
church records of this period from Guatemala and Chiapas in places
where Nahuatl was never the language of the local population. Also
938
many Nahuatl speakers were settled in Guatemala on lands given to
the Mexican and Tlaxcalan auxiliaries who helped the Spanish in the
Conquest. For example, of the town of Los Esclavos in Central
Guatemala Ponce (1873(1586)) said:      LLamanse aquellos indios esclavos, porque realmente lo
      fueronde l o s españoles e l l o s y otros muchos, recien
      conquistada la tierra, quando no estaban las cosas tan
      asentadas ni con tan buen orden como agora están, y un
      presidente (Alonso López Cerrato) de la Audiencia de
      Guatemala lebertó mas de diez mil dellos y los pobló
      en diversas partes, y de aquí se quedaron con aquel
      nombre, hablan la lengua mexicana corrupta, que se
      llama lengua p i p i l (Miles 1957:740).","[953, 954]"

          2. Panamint, Shoshone

    VI. Taracahitic
          1. Tarahumara
          2. Cahita, Varihio (Guarihio)
          3. Opata
    VII. Cora-Huichol (Corachol)
         1. Cora

    VIII. Nahua (Aztecan, Nahuatlan)
         1. +Pochutec
         2. Pipil         3. Core Nahua (all other Nahua varieties)       Note: + = extinct.
   Many proposals exist for higher-order, more inclusive groupings,
and there is now a near consensus that the family first split into
two branches, Northern Uto-Aztecan (which includes groups I-IV
here) and Southern Uto-Aztecan (groups V-VIII). More controversial
proposals have bunched Takic, Numic, and TUbatulabal in a proposed
Shoshonean group and have linked P i m a n and Taracahitic, and at
times Cora-Huichol and Nahua also, in a group called Sonoran.
Miller's (1984) recent classification is intermediate to these:

n o n s p e c i f i c to avoid the confusion t h a t other names used in the
l i t e r a t u r e have produced. I t i s important to explain some of these
terms in order to unravel some of this confusion.
       North American linguists tend to speak of the ""Aztec"" language.
This, however, i s unclear because the language i s not a d i r e c t
r e f l e c t i o n of Aztec culture, since i t was spoken contemporaneously
a l s o by non-Aztecs ( e . g . the T l a x c a l a n s ) . Other names which have
been used in reference to v a r i e t i e s of Nahua are: Nahuatl, Nahuat,
Nahuate (Naguate), Mejicano (Mexicano), Mejicano Corrupto (Corrupt
Mexican), P i p i l Nicarao, e t c .          Pochutec of Oaxaca (now e x t i n c t ,
see Boas 1917) i s the most divergent language of the subgroup.
While the case i s l e s s c l e a r , I believe that Central American Pipil
should also be considered a d i s t i n c t language, but more similar to
other v a r i e t i e s than Pochutec i s .      All others are considered dia-
l e c t s of a s i n g l e language, c a l l e d here ""Core Nahua"".         (For more

acceptable meaning for the term. Nevertheless, frequently ""Pipil""
has been employed not only for Central American P i p i l , but also for

Chiapas (southern Mexican s t a t e s ) ; c f . , for example, Fowler 1981,

of c l a s s i f i c a t i o n i s complicated by the need to interpret both the

       a d j e c t i v a l l y . For example, i n P i p i l wa:k-tuk means ""dry""

4.4. Questions   4.4.1. Yes-no questions. Yes-no questions are basically as in
Spanish, with rising intonation, but with no particular word-order

      ""Don't you feel cold?""      2) ti-k-piya we:y pan? (A-12)

      ""Is that you?""",[128]
"   2. Glottochronology. Several calculations of Nahua glotto-
chronology have been presented which involve Pipil and upon which
claims about Nahua classification have been based, e.g. Swadesh
1954-1955, 1963, 1967, Kaufman 1974, Garcia de León 1976,
Luckenbach and Levy 1980, and Fowler 1981. While glottochronology
is at best highly controversial, nevertheless proposals for Pipil
based on these calculations should be discussed. To begin with,
however, it should be mentioned that glottochronology has been
largely discredited, its basic assumptions have been challenged,
and its results often prove erroneous (cf. Campbell 1977:62-5).
   Garcia de León has placed Pipil close to Veracruz and Tabascan
varieties based on his counts. He says:    En cuanto a las relaciones internas del nahua del Golfo
    lo más significativo es el hecho de que la distancia
    interna mayor es de 9 siglos mínimos (between
    Cosoleacaque and Jalupa); en tanto que el pipil
    salvadoreño sólo difiere 6 siglos de Tuxtlas, Jaltipan,
    Pajapan, Boquiapan y Jalupa, lo cual indica que el
    primero es producto de un movimiento reciente que se
    efectuó en tiempos históricos (sólo 2 siglos antes de la
    Conquista); o bien, que habiéndose movido desde antes,
    fue hasta 6 siglos que perdió el contacto con la costa
    del Golfo. No seria nada aventurado suponer que antes
    del 1300 dC existia una continuidad de grupos nahuas
    desde Veracruz y Tabasco, hasta Guatemala y El Salvador;
    pasando por los Altos de Chiapas (dialecto del nahua del
    que quedaban hasta hace poco hablantes en Soyaló y
    Bochil) y por la costa del Soconusco (Huehuetán y otros).
    Probablemente, la expansión de los señoríos quichés y
    cakchiqueles de Guatemala favoreció la separación que
    explicaría los 6 siglos de divergencia entre el nahua del
    Golfo y el salvadoreño. (García de León 1976:41)García de León presented the Swadesh list of 100 words in various
Gulf dialects, but did not include the Pipil words with which he
compared them to arrive at his dates. He calculated that Pipil
shares 84% with the Nahua of Los Tuxtlas, Pajapan, Jáltipan
934(Veracruz), and Boquiapan (Tabasco), a separation of 5.8 minimum
centuries. His Gulf Nahua varied from 8 to 13 centuries with
respect to ""Mexihca"" ( C l a s s i c a l Nahuatl) and to other Nahua d i a -
l e c t s , which compares w e l l with Kaufman's f i g u r e of 11 minimum
centuries f o r General Nahua, i . e . Nahua minus Pochutec (Kaufman
1974:73).
      Luckenbach and Levy (1980), basing t h e i r c a l c u l a t i o n s on 25
dialects, follow Swadesh (1954-1955) in believing that the inter-
d i a l e c t a l r e l a t i o n s h i p s are ""properly thought of as 'chains' or
' n e t s ' , where each d i a l e c t has i t s c l o s e s t a f f i n i t i e s with i t s
immediate neighbor"" (p.456). They support the traditional three-
way s p l i t in Nahua of ""Nahuatl, Nahual, and Nahuat ( P i p i l ) , and a
variant i s o l a t e from Pochutla"" (p.456). They c a l c u l a t e the e a r -
l i e s t separations f o r Pochutla (= Pochutec) and Xochitlahuaca,
Guerrero from the remainder of Nahua at 543 A.D., with their Nahuat
( P i p i l ) node s p l i t t i n g o f f at 801 A.D. and with ""a Nahuat-Nahuatl
divergence ... calculated at A.D. 1072, and younger Intradialecti-
c a l ( s i c ) nodes ... found f o r Nahuat (A.D. 1257), Nahual (A.D.
1442), and Nahuatl (A.D. 1304 and 1511)"" (p.457).
      Fowler's (1981) c a l c u l a t i o n s correspond to these in s e v e r a l
ways. He placed the f i r s t s p l i t , that of Pochutec from other
Nahua, at 15 centuries ago, ca. 500 A.D.. He equated the "" f i r s t
P i p i l migrations out of c e n t r a l Mexico i n t o the lowlands of
Veracruz and Central America"" (p.539-43) with a group he c a l l e d
""Nahuat"" (a _ t - d i a l e c t ) , which includes Zacapoaxtla, Chicontepec,
T a t e l a , Mecayapan, and El Salvador.                   He placed t h i s Nahuat
migration at ca. 801 and put the beginnings of i t s i n t e r n a l
divergence at ca. 965 A.D. This matches Kaufman's (1974) date of
900 to 1,000 f o r the P i p i l migrations.                  S p e c i f i c a l l y , Fowler
(1981:536) presents the following years of separation:      1142 Salvador and Classical Nahuatl
      1097 Salvador and North Puebla
      942 Salvador and Milpa Alta
      1312 Salvador and Mecayapan
      1424 Salvador and Pochutec
      993 Salvador and Zacapoaxtla
      555 Salvador and Las Tuxtlas
      1044 Salvador and Tatela
      1044 Salvador and Chicontepec     Even i f these glottochronologlcal dates could be accepted with
confidence, they would s t i l l present d i f f i c u l t i e s of i n t e r p r e t a -
tion. For example, given Garcia de León's 7 centuries of internal
v a r i a t i o n among his Gulf d i a l e c t s (e.g. between Mecayapan and
                                                               935Jalupa), one must ask how Salvadoran Pipil's separation could be
shorter (only 6 centuries when compared with certain of these
dialects; Garcia de León 1976:41). Ethnohistorical sources seem to
indicate longer separation, but they, too, are difficult to inter-
pret unambiguously (see below). In any event, successful classifi-
cation cannot be based on glottochronology.
   The main question is whether the similarities shared by Pipil
and other Nahua varieties (especially Isthmus (Gulf) and Sierra de
Puebla) indicate a closer genetic relationship, or, whether Pipil's
marked differences mean that it is to be considered a distinct
variety with no closer connection to these other dialects. Given
the untrustworthy nature of Nahua dialectology and the unclear
status of the shared traits, it is possible that the question may
have no satisfactory answer. Nevertheless, based on standard
criteria for classification, I believe that Pipil is a distinct
branch. The similarities are either retentions of Proto-Nahua
features (which dialects may share by virtue of not having changed,
regardless of possible closer connections) or are parallel, inde-
pendent innovations (changes that easily take place independently).
On the other hand, Pipil's differences are not so easily explained
away. To repeat just one example, Pipil preserves original -_t
'plural', which has changed to -h (or corresponding          in all
others except Pochutec. This means that these others share an
innovation which argues that they were still unified when Pipil
split off, after which they changed to -h (~2) and subsequently
broke up into the extant variants. The only alternative historical
explanation that is at all plausible is the possibility that Pipil
and certain others were closer relatives, splitting off as a single
branch, with Pipil subsequently withdrawing while its remaining
close relatives underwent the -t_ to -h change under influence from
other dialects which had formerly so changed. While this is not
impossible, one would need to be able to show that Pipil and its
assumed closer relatives shared certain innovations before the
break up. The similarities are not compelling in this regard.
Moreover, there ought to be evidence of the assumed later diffu-
sion of the -jt to -Ji change in the others, but such evidence is
unknown.
   Thus, while it is not impossible that Pipil bears some closer
connection to dialects of Veracruz, Tabasco, or elsewhere, the
evidence suggests rather its long independence.       It is best
considered an independent branch of Nahua, not a member of Core
Nahua, but having split off from the rest of the family after
Pochutec was first separated.

"   4.2.4. 'Existential' nemi.    The verb n e m i is also used to
express ""there is"", ""there are"", ""exists"". It functions very much
like Spanish hay, ""there is/are"", including sometimes its singular
112form with plural nouns.      Some examples are:       1) nemi miyak tah-ta:ka-met tik te:chan. (SD)

       ""There are many men in town.""       2) tesu nemi miyak tah-ta:ka-met tik te:chan. (SD)

"     4.6.5. Possessive 'relational noun'. When a possessive pronoun
functions as an independent noun phrase, like ""mine"", ""yours"",
etc., it has the structure of a 'relational noun' with the root
- p a l plus a possessive pronominal prefix. A paradigm of these
forms is:   nu-pal           mine
   mu-pal           yours (sg.)
   i-pal            his/hers/its
   tu-pal           ours

     amu-pal (SD)
   im-pal            theirs
   te:-pal           someone else's, foreign
  Some sample sentences with the possessive relational noun are:    1) ini tu-pal    ""That's ours.""
120       2) i n i ha n i - k - n e k i - s k i y a ma: nu-pal (R-25)
       t h a t what I-i-want-COND t h a t mine
       "" T h a t ' s what I would l i k e t o be mine"" ( "" T h a t ' s what I wish
       were mine"").","[133, 134]"
"   4.6.3. Pal periphrastic possessive.   A periphrastic possessive
construction with pal also exists, probably created on analogy with
Spanish ¿e, e.g.:       1) plastas pal turuh (A-22)
       plasters of cow
       ""cowpies""       2) ne ihyak naka-t pal ne masa:-t (N-40)
       the stinking meat-ABSOL of the deer       3) i-ih-ikxi ke:n pal henteh (S-39)
       her-PL-foot like of people
       ""her feet (were) like people's""   4.6.4. Piya ""to have"".   Unlike many other Mesoamerican Indian

          Grammatical Categories and Morphology
3.0. Introduction     In this chapter the grammatical categories, or parts of speech,
and their morphology are described. In some ways these aspects of
P i p i l are prerequisites to an understanding of the syntactic con-
structions considered in the next chapter. Both t h i s chapter and
the next in general follow Langacker's (1977) order of presenta-
tion.","[52, 53]"

"What is essential is the parallelism; in the two (paired) clauses
which have basically the same structure ""feathers"" is parallel to
""bones"", and ""is"" to ""stayed"". In R-3, the parallelism is a total
repetition of the same clause. The sentence N-5 is a repetition of
N-4 with additional elaboration.",[883]
"   4.2.1. Pronominal copula. Equational constructions in which the
subject is a pronoun were considered in section 3.2.2.1. They are
formed by prefixing a subject pronoun normally found on verbs to
the complement, e.g. ni-ta:ka-t ""I am a man"".
   (Cf. section 3.2.2.1 for examples and details.)
                                                                   Ill   4.2.2. ¿ - c o p u l a . The equational copular construction has no
verb; the subject typically is a noun phrase, noun, or occasionally
an independent pronoun, while the c o m p l e m e n t is a noun phrase,
noun, adjective, or independent pronoun.           Some examples were
already seen (see 4.1.5.). A few others are:    (1) ne sipiti:yuh chikitik-chin,      ma: tumak ne i-xumpe.
    (Sip-2)
    the sipitillo small-DIMIN but large the his-hat.
    ""The Sipitillo (is) little, but his hat (is) very big.""    (2) ne tsuntekuma-t chikitik, pero tumak i-tsuntekun. (SD)
    the skull-ABSOL small but big his-head.
    ""The ""Skull""       small, but his head (is) very large.","[124, 125]"
"   3.2.3. Pronominal object prefixes. Transivitive verbs normally
bear also a prefix which references the object. These pronominal
object prefixes can cross reference an independent object pronoun,
noun, or noun phrase (usually with a third person prefix) or they
can signal the object directly if it is pronominal. These prefixes
are:    -nech-       me
    -mits-       you (singular)
    -k(i) -      him/her/it
    -tech-       us
    -mitsin-     you (plural)
    -(k)in-      themThe prefix -(k)in ""them"" has the lc when not preceded by another
prefix or w h e n a vowel precedes it. The k(i)~, the most frequent,
loses the vowel when preceded or followed by another vowel, but It
kepts its i_ before the elements - a h - and - e l (see section 2.2).
These function most frequently as direct objects, but also serve to
indicate indirect objects. (For more details concerning their
56
form, function, and what happens when direct and indirect objects
co-occur, see section 4.1.7). Some examples are:    ni-k-ida-k                   I saw it
    ni-k-neki                    I want it
    ki-neki                      he wants it
    ti-nech-ita-k                you saw rae
    ni-mits-ita-k                I saw you
    ti-mitsin-ita-ke-t           we saw you (pi.)
    tech-ita-ke-t                they saw us
    ni-kin-ita-k                 1 saw them
There are other elements which can occupy the place of these object
prefixes, e.g. m u - 'reflexive' and ta- 'unspecified object'. When
the verb bears one of these other object-like affixes, the object
pronominal prefixes do not appear (cf. section 3.7.4.).","[69, 70]"
"3.2. Pronouns   3.2.1. Independent pronouns. The full or independent pronouns
are optional, given that in any case subject and object pronominal
affixes are required with the verb. The independent pronouns are:    naha           I
    taha           you (singular)
    yaha           he/she/it
    tehemet        we
    amehemet (SD),
    an-ehemet (C) you (plural)
    yehemet        they    In normal speech these may optionally appear in an abbreviated
forra, if they bear no particular emphasis, e.g.:
54
     na, nah                I
     ta, tah                you (singular)
     ya, yah                he/she/it
     te(:)met               we
     ame(:)t,
     an=e(:)met             you (plural)
     ye(:)met               theyIn actual use, the abbreviated        singular    forms are m u c h   more
frequent that the plurals.","[67, 68]"

     yu:li-k      soft, slow   3.6.2. -nah. Unlike the -(ti-)k class of adjectives, which are
semantically unmarked or neutral, the second class takes the suffix
-nah which means something like 'somewhat', similar to English
""-ish"", e.g. chichi:l-nah ""reddish, somewhat red"". The -nah adjec-
tives are derived from basic adjective stems or from nouns and
verbs. Some examples are:     chichi :1-nah      reddish       pilich-nah      wrinkled
     chipak-nah         clear         pili:x-nah      feeble

     pelech-nah         wounded, skinned   3.6.3. -a:wa-k / -a-k. The third class of adjectives is related
morphologically to the - w a - 'inchoative' verbs (cf. section
                                                                                                          633.7.8.3.1.)      These have a s h o r t v a r i a n t , - a - k , which o c c u r s i n

morphology is the most extensive and because they fall into dis-
tinct classes defined in part phonologically by changes in their
roots when different tenses and aspects are involved. For that
reason, these tenses and aspects are described first, and then the
verb classes which depend on them are presented.","[75, 76, 77, 78, 79]"

"   Some examples of this rule's application, in which nouns with
the absolutive suffix compared with other forms, are:      atimi-t,
nu-atin ""my louse""; chikiwi-t. nu-chikiw ""my basket""; kakawa-t.
nu-kakaw ""my cacao""; kaxi-t, nu-kax ""my bowl""; kuyame-t. nu-kuyan
""my pig""; kwita-t, nu-kwit ""my excrement""; peta-t, nu-pet ""my
mat""; tekuma-t, nu-tekun ""my bottle gourd""; ikx-u:miyu ""shin"" (from
ikxi- ""foot"" + u:mi-yu ""bone""); ku:n-ti:l ""soot"" (from ku:mi-
""pot"" + ti:l   ""soot (black))""; kuyan=iswa-t ""cuyanigua (a wild
root like a sweet potato)"" (from kuyame- ""pig"" + iswa-t ""leaf"");
etc.
   (1.3) Vowel loss in suffixes. This same rule applies to suf-
fixes, as well. For example, the absolutive suffix has two main
allomorphs, -ti with nouns that end in a consonant, and        with
those which terminate in a vowel (see secation 3.1.1). With -ti as
the underlying (basic) form of this suffix, the - ¿ i s lost if no
consonant clusters result.     For example, underlying /a:ka-ti/
""reed"" becomes a:ka-t (recall that the root-final -a is not lost
when it is protected by the lc (see above)), while in /es-ti/
""blood"" the    of the absolutive -ti is maintained since that its
loss would otherwise result in a final consonant cluster and also
in a monosyllabic form. Some examples both with -C-ti and with -V-t
are:   kak-ti ""sandal"", pah-ti ""medicine"", tix-ti ""corn dough"",
sin-ti ""maize"", me:ts-ti ""moon""; a:waka-t ""avocado"", a:chiyu-t
""bixa (achiote)"", a:-t ""water"", e:-t ""bean"", e:lu-t ""roasting ear
(ear of corn)"", ku:ska-t ""necklace"", kwawi-t ""tree""; etc.
   Similarly, the 'preterite (past tense)' suffix has two allo-
morphs, -ki after consonants and -lc after vowels. (It also has the
variant   in some cases, but that is not relevant to this rule (see
section 3.3.2.).) With /-ki/ as the underlying (basic) form, the
vowel-loss rule eliminates the      if no consonant clusters arise.
For example, compare -maka-k ""(he) gave (it)"", where the -a of the
verb root is protected from loss by the lc and where the final -i of
the suffix is lost, with -chiw-ki ""(he) did (it)"", where the-root
final vowel was lost which created a consonant cluster which in
turn prevented the final vowel of the 'preterite' suffix from loss
(for more examples, see section 3.3.2.).
                                                                 31
   (1.4) Vowel loss in prefixes. Pipil generally keeps its prefix-
final vowels in contrast to Classical Nahuatl and most other Nahua
varieties which tend to lose a prefix vowel when it appears before
another vowel. Notwithstanding, in certain limited contexts Pipil
also loses this vowel. Unlike these other varieties of Nahua,
Pipil does not lose the vowel of possessive prefixes or of subject
pronominal prefixes on verbs, except before the verbal directional
morpheme (w)al- or before i. Some examples are:   n-i:xwi ""I'm filling up/getting full"" (from ni-i:xwi)
   x-ihisiwi ""hurry up!"" (from xi-ihisiwi)
   t-ihkiti ""you weave"" (from ti-ihkiti)and:   x-al-ahsi ""find it!"" (cf. xi-ahsi ""arrive!"")
   t-al-ahsi-k ""you found it"" (cf. ti-ahsi-k ""you arrived"")
   n-al-ahsi-k ""I found it"" (cf. ni-ahsi-k ""I arrived"")
   t-al-ahsi-ke-t ""we found it""(cf. ti-ahsi-ke-t ""we arrived"").","[44, 45]"

   When the subject is a full, Independent pronoun, it always
precedes the verb, I.e. Subject(=pron.)-Verb(-Object). Examples of
sentences with independent pronominal subjects, which precede the
verb, are:   1) na ni-k-elna:miki. (H-l)
   I I-it-remember.
   ""I remember it.""   2) kunih yaha ki-chiw-ki se: trampah. (H-7)

   ""But they didn't tell the truth.""   4) kunih yemet ki-a:n-ke-t ne we:suh. (H-25)
   then they it-pick up-PRET-PL the bone.
   ""Then they picked up the bones.""   5) yaha ki-neki ki-kaki cuentos. (A-2)
