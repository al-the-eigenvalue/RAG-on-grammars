"  ( 2 ) U S E OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.
  (a) In perhaps the majority of cases the substantive verb follows
and is phonetically disconnected from its predicate noun or subject;
an adverb, however, may precede and the predicate noun follow the
verb. In these cases the final vowel of the word preceding the
substantive verb is elided. Examples are:
cina'rjwav aru""a coyote it-is
''itc aro""ami' qa'tcu quna""ap-A this (inan.) be-usitative not fire-
    negative, this (that we have been burning) is not fire

   (b) A second method of employing substantive verbs is to attach
them to the preceding predicate noun or subject (noun or independent
pronoun), a glottal stop separating the a- or u- of the substantive
verb from the preceding final vowel, which is preserved; e. g. iici'
'aru'a- this (inan.) i s beside ''itc aru'a-. Perhaps such forms as iter'
'am'a- may be considered as verbs with incorporated nominal (or
pronominal) subject (§ 18, 2, f, t); e. g. Hci""aru'a~, cinaywavi'urywaro'a-.
Forms of this type are obligatory for independent pronouns of the
first and second persons. Examples are:
sari 'tcL dro'"" dog it-is
na'a'ints tsi' aru'"" little-girl it-is (absolute: na'a'intsits )

   (c) The idea of B E I N G OF, B E L O N G I N G TO is normally expressed, as
illustrated above in several examples, by preceding the substantive
verb with an objective form of genitive significance, e. g.:
ni'niaru' aro' aro""anA me-interrogative is being, is it being of me?
   is it my property?
n\'ni \waru"""" me he-is, he is mine
imi' 'uraru"" (aru""anA) thee it-is (being), it is yours
  By a curious idiom, however, the logical owner is sometimes put
in the subjective, the thing owned in the objective, as though the
substantive verb were to be translated directly as ΤΟ OWN, e. g.:
itci'an aro""ai' this (inan.)-obj.-I be- present, this is mine, I own this

There are commonly used constructions in Paiute that are analogous
to such English locutions as IT IS I WHO — with predicate pronoun,
except that there is no substantive verb expressed, the IT doing
service for it. The pronominal form for IT employed in Paiute is
the inanimate visible enclitic, -aq a-. I t is regularly preceded, it
would seem, by enclitic -a-, - a- (§ 19, 3, a). There is always a

252                                   SAPIRstrong emphasis on the independent pronoun to which the -aqa- is
attached. Examples are:
rii'a q- 'oai' I-α- it (vis.), it is I (for 'oai' see § 60, 3)
imi'ni(y)a q· ucu       thou-like-it, maybe it is you (-niaq- probably <
    -nia-a-aq a-; for ucu see § 60, 3)
""mwa'rja q-A, mwarfa 'q A that one it is, it is he (vis.)
""mwarj'a 'q-A n j ' m p\m'k-aiJc-ainA that (vis.) -a- it (vis.) me ( = my)

    from my having been done, that is where I am from
  Somewhat similar to these constructions is the explanatory use of
mwa'fi- THAT (inan. vis.), equivalent to THAT IS WHY —, e. g.:

    The negative active participle ends in -ywa'ait'i-, e. g.:qa nona'c irjwai't 'i not dreaming

-ywa'ai-yu- (§ 55, 1, c), e. g.:na 'may'waiYUcampa t),t      riiru'xwA   without saying anything, (give)

  clus.), while we are not eating  There are absolute verb forms in -ψοα'αρα-, a suffix apparently
combining -ijwa'a(i)- and -apa- (see a). It is not evident how they
differ, if at all, from ordinary negative absolutes in - ap a-. Examples
are:

  used as negative verb; cf. qatcu'rarjWA paa'iyarjwa' aicv we (inclus.)

in -ywa'apa- (but cf. negatived agentives in -vi'ap a-, 1 above), e. g.:rii' qatc ampa'xAhtirjwa'ap αφι I not talk-cause-negative-agentive, I
    (am) one who causes not to talk, I do not allow to talk   (c) Negative forms of verbalizing -kai-. The verbalizing suffixes
-kai- το B E and -kai- το HAVE (see § 26, 1, a and b) become -ai- in the
negative. This - ai- takes the place of any specifically negative suffix.

  The negative participle corresponding to positive -kanii-          BEING,
HAVING ( § 26, 1, a and b) is -ait-ϊ-,
                                  e. g.:

   As we have already seen (§ 32, 6), narrative past -p'iyai- is com-
pounded of past passive participle -ρ Ϊ- and -yai- ΤΟ HAVE. Its
negative correspondent is therefore -p'i'ai-\ -yai-p-'iyai- HAD —, WAS —
is doubly negatived to -αί-ρ-ϊ'αι-.       The negative correspondent of
participial -p'iyanfi- (§ 25, 6, e) is -p-V ait-ϊ-. Examples are:

  The negative verbalizing -ai- appears as - a -, -a '- before subordi-
nating -q u-; -a-'q-u- WHEN HAS NOT, WHEN IS NOT thus corresponds
to positive -kaiyu-, e. g.:

   impersonal-only, though others were not coyote-like   (d) Negatives in -n a'ai-. A few verbs, chiefly verbs of sight, use
-n a'ai- as negative suffix instead of the normal -rjwa'ai- (b above);
participialized, -n a'ait i-. Unlike -rjwa'ai-, however, -n a'ai- pre-
cedes future -va - and is followed by narrative -p 'iyai-.

"                            § 53. Internal stem changes.
  Verbal stem changes in Paiute that are of morphological signifi-
cance may be classified under the heads of reduplication (see § 58,3-6),
vocalic modification, and consonantal affection. Only the two latter
are discussed at this point.
   (1) VOCALIC ALTERNATIONS. Vocalic alternations are either quanti-
tative or qualitative, the former, insofar as they are of morphological

            S O U T H E R N P A I U T E , A S H O S H O N E A N LANGUAGE       237
significance, being relatively infrequent. In all, six types of vocalic
alternation may be recognized.
   (a) Vocalic lengthening. A short vowel may be lengthened, a long
one over-lengthened (e. g. a· to a-a), to indicate the idea of I N V A I N ,
TO NO EFFECT, e .    g.:qa'aplya'    sang to no effect ( < qa - to sing)
'a'aip'iya'   said without effect ( < ai- to say)
α'τηραχαΐ     talks to no purpose ( < ατηρα'χαϊ talks)
'o 'n'niy'uq WA did it (inv.) in vain ( < un Crfitq-WA did it)
These examples indicate that it is regularly the first vowel of the
word which is lengthened.
  Another group of cases of vocalic lengthening seems to be associated
with the idea of continuation. Examples are not very numerous:
pini rjw'in-q n uq WLXw'aim'arjWA look-stand about (-yw'ino- < -Tjwln-'L-
   to stand, assimilated by following -n vq tt>t-)-run-go-future-him
   (inv.), shall go to stand around looking for him
Uni ' ^ u ' u m i do ( < t{m-)-subordinating-them (inv.), while they 2
   were so doing
po'to'qwa-       to be spherical: pSts'i]'i'kai- to be spherical
tsi 'tsnjwayaip iyain C it seemed that (arrows) were stuck in in
   several places (lengthened from normal reduplicated tsit si- >
   tstsi'-)
  Perhaps ma'ni-campa-              BARELY is similarly lengthened from
mani'-campa- T H A T - W A Y - O N L Y , ONLY IN THAT WAY, e. g.:
uvwa""axl    ma-^ni'campA    ya'aqwipiya'                 it   (inv.)-over   barely
  entered, barely escaped by going over it
  (b) Vocalic alternation to indicate number (and voice). In certain
verbs, the final vowel is a, a·, o, or u in the intransitive singular, i in
the intransitive plural and in the transitive. Examples are:
topa-qi-   (tree, feather, tooth)          iivi-trai-several come loose; -top i-
  comes loose                                 n'na-       to pluck out one;

-a- vowel of the stem when used iteratively (or continuatively) con-
trasts with an -i- of the stem when used semelfactively, e. g.:
up-vq-(w)i-      to bounce (once)              ovwoq(w)a-y(s)i-  to bounce up

static (-<-). A very considerable number of verb stems alternate in
their final vowel between α• and i, a smaller number between ya-
and i. The former form of the stem is used for the active intransitive
(or transitional) voice, the latter for the medio-passive, static, or
resultative voice. The i- forms seem to be durative, the a - forms
tend to be momentaneous. Examples are:
i -p otsin'i-l- ai- to be ready to             potsin'na - to start off (for a race)

appreciable difference in meaning between the i- and a- forms,
though this may be due to inadequate translation, e. g.:tcuywi-    to approach (tr.)           tcuywu-     dit.
rin'i-  to be frightened, surprised    nri'ya•-    dit.   (e) Alternation of transitional -i- and static -a -. This type, ap-
parently the exact opposite of the preceding, is sparsely represented,
e. g.:
pono'a•-     to be full                jano'i-    to become full   ( f ) Alternation of intransitive -i-, -a - and transitive -a-. In these
verbs it Ls difficult to discover the difference in meaning between
the -i- and -a - forms (cf. d above). In some cases only -i- alternates
with -a-. T h e alternation of -i- and -a- is evidently an old Uto-Aztekan
feature; cf. such Xahuatl doublets as cotoni τ ο BREAK (intr.): cotona
τ ο WOUND, CUT; tomi τ ο OPEN UP (intr.): toma τ ο OPEN (tr.), DELIVER;

vised from intransitives in -a- or as built on -α- transitives with
lengthened vowel before   (2) CONSONANTAL AFFECTION. Two groups of cases are to be
recognized, glottalization and gemination of stem consonants. These
seem to be equivalent processes. Not infrequently they occur to-
gether in the same form, e. g. tska'pin'NA το CUT (momentaneously):
ts-kaniNA το CUT (duratively).
   (a) Glottalization of verb stems. This process operates:      1. To indicate distribution, e. g.:
fVA'tcü'ywiyuni      four                    wa'a'yWAtcÜTjwiyun C eight (lit.,
                                               four here and there)
waijwi-   several stand                      wa'a'rjwituip'iya' caused (them)
                                               each to stand
yun a- to put several down (in               yuna'(a)i-     to put down in sev-
  one place)                                   eral places
      2. To indicate iteration, e. g.:
iyon a- to carry in one's arms               iyan'na- to carry several times
ya-vayai-   to fear                          yi'i-p-aq ai- to be afraid several
                                                times (note irregular change of
                                                -a - to -Ϊ -)     3. To indicate momentaneous activity, e. g. -n'na- momentaneous
transitive with singular object: -n a- durative transitive with singular
object (§ 30, 4).
   Glottalization alone as a grammatical process is relatively rare.
Generally it accompanies distributive or iterative reduplication (see
§ 58, 3 and 4), less often gemination alone (see b).
   (b) Gemination in verb stems. Gemination primarily denotes
momentaneous activity; the contrast between momentaneous and
durative, as might be expected, tends to become one of singularity
and plurality. Gemination is very commonly employed with the
momentaneous suffixes -q i- (§ 30, 3) and -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c). Other
examples of momentaneous gemination are:

-ya- durative suffix (§ 30, 1)           -qi- momentaneous suffix (§ 30,3)
   Far less frequently gemination indicates iterative activity, e. g.:
qaqafi-     to run away                  qaqat'i-    to run away several
                                           times
ya-vayai-     to fear                    yV'i-paqai-   to be afraid several
                                           times
   Even these examples are really but special forms of gemmation
accompanying reduplication. Combined gemination and reduplica-
tion, to indicate distribution or iteration, is common (see § 58, 3, h;
§ 58, 4, a, d, f).
                        § 54. Singular and. plural stems.
   All verbs are determined as regards singularity or plurality of the
subject, less often of the object also; the singular form includes
reference to the dual. The most common method of indicating
plurality of the subject is by the use of the suffix -q a- (§ 31, 1, c); for
other suffixes indicating or implying plurality of subject or object, see
§ 31, 1, a and b; § 3 1 , 2 , a-d. Vocalic alternation of the final vowel of
the stem is also sometimes associated with change of number (see § 53,
1, b). The idea of distribution expressed by reduplication often passes
over into that of plurality of the subject or object (see § 58, 3).
   Besides these formal methods of expressing number, there are
certain verb stems that are inherently limited in their reference to
number, the singular-dual of the intransitive subject or transitive
object being expressed by a stem which is etymologically distinct

from that for the plural of the intransitive subject or transitive object.
Certain of these stem contrasts are:

    Several of these verb stems are also used as the second element
in compound verbs. T h e whole verb may be characterized as singular
or plural in this w a y ; a pluralizing -q a- may thus become unnecessary,
e. g. ivi- O N E D R I N K S : im-k a- S E V E R A L D R I N K , but ivi-ywin-'i- O N E
DRINKS S T A N D I N G : iviywaywi- S E V E R A L DRINK S T A N D I N G .     Singularity
or plurality of the object is not disturbed by composition, e. g.
paq a-rjw'in 'i- O N E STANDS AND K I L L S O N E ; paq a-rjwaywi- S E V E R A L
S T A N D A N D K I L L O N E ; qj'i-ijwin 'i- O N E S T A N D S AND K I L L S S E V E R A L ;

  A small number of singular and plural verb stems are used only
as second elements in verb compounds, e. g.:
-kwa'{a)i-    one goes (see § 28, 1;    -m ia- several go (less frequently
   practically suffix)                     used as independent stem)
-ya'(a)i-    to die (independent        -tupi-, -tupa-      (only in com-
  stem), e. g. tiyii-ya'ai- to die of      pounds; perhaps identical with
  hunger, to be hungry                     tup i- to be used up), e. g.
                                           fiyvi-tcupi- several are hungry,
                                           naya-ntupa- several get angry
uxqu'mpu-tcaq ai-      one (thing)      uTqu' mpu-tcdcai-xw' ai-     several
  goes off in dust                         (things) go up in dust
  The plural -namtci- το BECOME (perhaps reciprocal no-® +             pitci-
TO ARRIVE: TO ARRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER, TO GET TO BE AMONG
THEMSELVES) either corresponds to singular -tiqay'wi- (also used
independently) το BECOME or is used as a verbal quasi-suffix of
plurality, e. g.:
qatcutiqarj'wi-    to not-become,       qatcvn avitci- several get tired out
   one gets tired out
pat.caqwi- one is (or gets) wet         patcaq winavitci- several get wet
tuywi- fire goes out                    tuywinavitci- fires go out                            § 55. Verb syntax.
 Under this head may be conveniently grouped a number of pheno-
mena that affect the verb in relation to other words in the sentence.
   ( 1 ) SUBORDINATING ELEMENTS.      Subordinate clauses, denoting
cause, time, condition, concession, or attendant circumstance, are
extremely frequent in Paiute. Those of these clauses that are used
with logical subjects put them in the objective form. Thus, a
sentence like WHEN I CAME, YOU WERE AWAY is rendered WHEN ME
CAME, YOU WERE AWAY.       In all probability the objective is in these
cases to be interpreted genitivelv, the subordinating element as a
specialized postposition; e. g. AT MY COMING, YOU WERE AWAY.
This receives some support from the fact that a few of the ordinary
postpositions may be suffixed to verb forms (see 2 below). However,
of the verb-subordinating elements only -yu- (see c below), possibly
also -qu- (see e), is employed also with nouns (see § 50, 4, 49). The
262                             X Southern Paiute and Ute
      244                                      SAPIR
      tense elements -pa·- (§ 32, 4) and -q-ai- (§ 32, 3) may precede the
      subordinating suffix, but not the other tense elements. Five sub-
      ordinating suffixes are found, the first three of which introduce
      clauses referring to the subject of the main clause, the other two
      clauses with a different subject.
         (a) -tsi- gerund. Subordinates in -tsi- are here termed gerunds
      because they have no expressed subject, though they may have an
      object. Their logical subject is always the same as that of the main
      clause. They indicate antecedent circumstance or activity and
      are most appropriately translated in English by participial phrases:
      HAVING — E D .   I t is at least possible that the gerund -i st.- is etymologi-
      cally related to the animate noun suffix -tsi- (§ 24, 1, f); such a sentence
      as HAVING so DONE, H E RETURNED would then originally have meant
      THE ONE WHO DID so RETURNED.             Examples are:      maa'iisiyw imi'ywa'aiijiVA pa(i)yi'kiva'   find-gerund-him   (inv.) thou-
          with-him (inv.) return-hither-will; having found him with you, (he)

          (plur.), having returned, (they) caused (it) to rain

          connector); uniyutsiyiVA    then he (inv.)

        Future gerunds in -va t-si-, -vipatsi- BEING ABOUT TO—are also
      very common and frequently found in idiomatic turns. Examples

of action. Examples are:sv'vw'ar)WA qari'm'miuxa' t'(ψνϊ'ιυα if (§ 60, 2, d)-he (inv.) sit-move-as

   -kai-c-u- (with enclitic -cu-; see § 19, 2, k) often implies immediate
sequence: AS SOON AS, e. g.:

   coyote fire-at-being (obj.) covered; as soon as Coyote said so, (he)
   covered some of (the) fire  Concessive clauses of the same subject as the main clause are
formed by appending -c-ampa- (§ 19, 2, j) to -kai-, e. g.:iya'xaxayqaic ampa yA though fearing him (vis.), (he went to meet
   him)
   (c) -yu- WHEN, WHILE, AS. This subordinating suffix seems to
be identical in meaning with -kai- (see b above). I t is suffixed only
to stems or verb suffixes ending in -ai-. I t always replaces -kai- after
verb suffixes ending in -ai- (e. g. resultative subordinate -q-ai-yu-
WHEN SAYING, not *-q-ai-yai-).       After verb stems in -ai, -kai- is
used (e. g. ai-yai- WHILE SAYING), unless followed by enclitic -c-ampa-,
but not, e. g., -cu- (hence ai-yai-c u-, but ai-yu-c ampa-).   Examples
of -yu- clauses are:niijwl'xaiyu' n'ni person-be-as-thou do! act like a person!
naijqa'q ai'yvq IVA when (he) heard it (inv.)   Clauses in -yu-cu-, analogous to those in -kai-c-u- and -ku-c-u-,

whose subject is different from that of the main clause. Unlike -qa-

temporaneity of action. Examples are:

"  The interrogative frequently combines with a following -γαinia-
(see a above) in the meaning of IT SEEMS THAT. The enclitic - Η Ι Α -
(see d above) may be introduced between the two enclitics. Pro-
nominal elements may separate the interrogative (or following -nia-)
from -yainia-.   Examples are:pua'r'uavar'onLxaint.'     medicine-become-shall-interrogative-I-appar-

element -rua- {-tcua-, -ntcua-·, -ntua-) has not been found alone, but
only compounded with interrogative -r'o- + enclitic -n ia-. This
compound enclitic has been found only with nouns. It follows posses-
sive pronominal enclitics. Examples are:

-cia-) has not been found alone, but only compounded with modal
-ywa- (see c above) and generally - n o a - (see e above). Pronominal
enclitics come between the -ywa- and the -n oa-, except, as usual,
-ni- I, ME, which follows -n oa-. Examples are:
qu'qwi'tu'acuyaywaayanoA       shoot-impersonal-would that!-him-in-
  definite, I wish he would get shot!
qu'qwi'lu'acuywaraminoA    I wish we two (inclus.) would get shot!
qu'qwi'iu'acuywanoani    would that I might get shot!
   In this sense -cuya-ywcMioa-     is often attached to the verbal
irrealis -yo-pu-, -r/qo-pu- (see § 33, 1), e. g.:

  With impi- WHAT (see § 44, 1, c), -c uya-ywa-n oa- or, more briefly,
-cuya-ywa- adds a flavor of unreality: WHAT PRAY! Examples are:

  pray, is one (to cut it up) ? (i. e. there is no knife handy)
imp'i'A'ciaywarfA tVqa'va' what-objective-would that!-he eat-shall?
  what, pray, will he eat? (i. e. there is no food to give him)
  (i) -c a'a- AND, BUT; THEN! This element is used partly as a con-
nective or contrastive (AND, BUT), partly as an emphasizing particle
(THEN!). In the latter use it is frequently appended to ϊν""ϊ-, the
hortatory adverb. Examples are:
rii""ca'a but I; I, for my part
mat/a'c a'"" but that one

 The primary idea of ONLY shades off in idiomatic usage to other
modal nuances, e. g.:

just-preterit-I; see § 59, 1 ) , with certain adverbs (e. g. m 't uc u LONG
AGO; na'a 'c u SEPARATELY; a'iv^ic u ENOUGH; see § 60, 2), and very
commonly with independent third personal and reflexive pronouns
(see § 39, 1; § 46). For its employment with subordinating verbal
suffixes (-kai-, -leu-), see § 55, 1, b, e. I t has largely lost its individu-
ality with personal pronouns, as indicated by its double employment
in forms like mafi'c cu' above, i. e. mafi'-c u-.
   (1) -c uru'u- NOR CAN. It was not found possible to elucidate
this infrequently occurring enclitic satisfactorily. I t is evidently
compounded of -cu- (see k above); perhaps -ru'u- was misheard
for interrogative -ru'a-. Examples are:

enclitics, is often best translated PERHAPS, particularly when accom-

not easily classified and, in part, of doubtful significance, may be
conveniently grouped here.

of these enclitics indicates. They precede pronominal enclitics, but
follow certain other enclitic elements (e. g. -tea-, see 1, a above; -C M-,
see 2, k above). They are probably found in -a-^ain ia- (2, a) and
-ywa-'a- (1, b), as already suggested. Examples are:

   ( 4 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF PARTICIPLES.    Participles are extremely in
evidence in Paiute. They are employed in a variety of syntactic
ways:
   (a) Attributively, when they may often be translated as relative
clauses or as adjectives.
   (b) Denominatively, e. g. to'ywant'i FIGHTING > FIGHTER, second-
arily HAVASUPAI INDIAN; uvwa-'nt aRi THERE-BEING IT, THE THING
THAT IS THERE.
   (c) Adverbially, particularly with verbalized postpositional forms,
e. g. tümpwi'a-ij 'am-nÜA p\rn'ka ROCK-OBJ.- HE (VIS), IT-AT-BEING-
OBJ. LOOK, i. e. HE LOOKS THERE AT THE ROCK rather than H E SEES THE
ROCK THAT IS THERE.
    (d) Predicatively after verbs, particularly substantive verbs, e. g.
t'itc aro""ami ayan an-i'ntci THIS (INAN.) IS-USITATIVE HOW DOING?
HOW DOES IT WORK? qatcu an ik- %ijwaTjw'ait 'i NOT DOES RAINING
(NEG.), IT DOES NOT RAIN.
   (e) In lieu of finite verbs, particularly after independent personal
pronouns. Such participles may be considered as special cases of
predicative usages (d), the substantive verb being omitted. They
refer to general time as a rule. Examples are:
a'imintim'i say-usitative-participle-plural, (those) wont to say, (they)
   always say
rii' to'ywanii I fighting, I am a fighter
i'mi cii'xaxwai't-uim-inünl    thou squaw-bush-get-go-causative-usita-
    tive-participle-me, you always cause ine to go to get squaw-bush
    twigs
   ( 5 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF ADJECTIVES.      Practically all adjectives are
properly verbal in form. As such, they may be predicatively em-
ployed, like any verb; or, in participial form, attributively or de-
nominatively (e.g. ""'a't 'i tiyo'qwdci     GOOD-BEING RUNNING, GOOD
RUNNER). They may also be employed, in their bare stem-form,
as the first, rarely second, elements of noun compounds (see § 18, 1, d
and e).
   A few adjectives are properly nominal in form, e. g. imaf'p'its·

attributively to refer to an incorporated noun, e. g.:
mia""p 'itsiA wana' Rup'iya' little-obj. net-make-past, made a little net                              § 56. Substantive verbs.
   ( 1 ) FORMATION     OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.      Substantive verbs are
formed from the demonstrative stems a- and u- by means of a verbal-
izing -ro'a-: am'α- το BE (vis.), uru'a- το BE (inv.). These forms may
be used with all nouns, animate or inanimate, and independent
pronouns. These simple forms are also used as the nucleus of a
set of substantive verbs of specific pronominal reference, composed
of the pronouns urjwa- HE, um-'C- THEY, and uru- IT, to which are
respectively appended (not phonetically suffixed) aro'a- for the visible,
uru'a- for the invisible, forms. I t is remarkable that the u- pronouns,
which are properly invisible, should be used in visible substantive
verbs as well, visibility and invisibility being expressed by the a- or u-
of the verb proper. The pronominal substantive verbs thus are:urjw aro'a-   h e is (vis.)                uy uru'a-     h e is (inv.)
umw aro'a- they are (vis.)                 urn uru'a- they are (inv.)
ur aro'a- it is (vis.)                     ur uru'a- it is (inv.)   These may be conveniently written as single words, e. g. uraro'a-
IT is (VIS.). The present tense of substantive verbs is designated
either by the normal -y'i- (§ 32, 1) or, more frequently, by the
absence of a tense suffix. The substantive verb may also take on
other tense suffixes, the modal -νϊ - (§ 33, 2), the usitative suffixes
(§ 30, 10 and 11), the participial -η-, and the nominal abstract
-na-  (§ 25, 3).","[265, 266, 267]"
"   (2) ENCLISIS. By enclisis is meant the suffixing of certain ele-
ments to any word in the sentence, the resulting complex constituting
a firm phonetic, but not a strictly formal, unit. Enclitic elements,
except for some of the pronouns, never occur in other than enclitic
form. In a ""word"" like ivi'rjunicar dam DID I T A K E A DRINK? The
preterital -ntca-, the interrogative -r'oa-, and the pronominal -ηι I
are enclitic elements, not true suffixes, the true ""word,"" formally
speaking, consisting only of ivi'yu- ΤΟ T A K E A DRINK (ivi- ΤΟ DRINK
+ momentaneous suffix -iju-). This is shown by the fact that the
enclitic cluster -(n)tcar'oam can be appended, without bringing about
any strictly formal modifications, to a preceding word in the sentence;
e. g. qan i'va tcar'oan ivi'yu H O U S E - A T - P R E T E R I T - I N T E R R O G A T I V E - I
DRINK- MOMENTANEOUS, DID I DRINK AT THE HOUSE?                                 Phonetically
the form DID-1-AT-THE-HOUSE? is a perfect unit, morphologically it
is a word (qan i'-va - HOUSE-AT) plus a number of exteriorly segmented
elements that have no independent existence. Enclisis is thus neither
true suffixation nor juxtaposition of independent elements. I t has
the external characteristics of the former (including strict adherence
to certain principles of order), the inner feeling of the latter. I t is
one of the most characteristic processes of Paiute, doubtless of
                 Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean          Language
             SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN               LANGUAGE                71
Plateau Shoshonean generally. Enclitics include pronominal ele-
ments (see § 40) and elements of temporal and adverbial force (see
§ 19).
    (3) PREFIXATION (see § 20). A considerable number of elements
is prefixed to stems; they consist chiefly of adverbial elements and
instrumental prefixes. They have purely derivational, not formal,
significance. In origin they are doubtless, at least in large part,
independent stems that have lost their individuality and now appear
only as first elements of compounds (with qu-a BY M E A N S O F F I R E ,
e.' g., cf. independent qun a- F I R E ) .
   ( 4 ) S I I F F I X A T I O . V (see § § 2 3 - 3 7 ) . This is the most important
grammatical process of all. Under suffixes are included both deriva-
tional elements (e. g. agentive -vi-n, -mpi-n) and elements of strictly
formal significance (e. g. objective -a-, -ya-\ verb subordinating -yai-,
-q ai-, -rjqai-).
   (5) REDUPLICATION (see § 58). As a formal process reduplication
is always initial. Final reduplication occurs only in isolated words
and has no formal or derivational function. There are several
distinct types of reduplication. The ideas expressed by the process
are chiefly those of distribution, iteration and momentaneous activity
  (6) C O N S O N A N T A L C H A N G E S . These are quite apart from the
mechanical changes undergone by consonants in composition (§ 16).
Consonantal changes include:
   (a) Gemination of stem consonants (see § 53, 2, b). The geminating
of the consonant or consonants indicates generally momentaneous
or semelfactive as contrasted with durative activity. I t is also
frequently found in connection with certain types of reduplication
(see § 58, 3 and 4). Less commonly it is employed alone to give
iterative force to the stem (see § 53, 2, b). Sporadic examples in
noun derivationalso occur, e. g. aip a-tsi- B O Y : aiva-(p 'äsi-) Y O U T H .
   (b) Glottalization, the insertion of a more or less movable glottal
stop in the body of a stem or suffix. This occurs most frequently in
connection with certain types of reduplication (see § 58, 3 and 4).
Like gemination, it is also used to express momentaneous activity
and iteration (see § 53, 2, a). Gemination and glottalization tend to
be associated or equivalent processes. This may eventually help
to clear u p the origin of the geminating power of certain stems (§ 16,
2).

and of no functional significance; these may be survivals in part of
older processes, in part they have sound-imitative value. Other
vocalic interchanges are associated with definite alternations of
function.  (a) Sporadic interchanges.      An alternation of a- (a) and ο (»·) is
found in:para-xa-     rain patters                poro-xwa- sound of hail, horse's
                                           hoofs
panta-ya-      to make a peeking         ponto-ywa- to sound like a thud
  noise  An ο of the durative alternates with an ϊ of the iterative form of
the stem in:ya -vayai-    to be afraid               y'i'i-p aq ai-    to be afraid several
                                             times
     ϊ and a alternate in:-tiyania-   adverbial affix (§ 60, 2, b) -toyon-ia-       (rarer form of same)
tco-qoqoi- to sound like a punch- tci-q iq ii-            ditto
   ing noise   In the latter example the primary form tea-' WITH THE FIST (§ 20, 2)
is assimilated to the ϊ- vowels of the stem; conversely, -q-oq-oi- may
represent an assimilation of -q iq 'ii- to the a of the prefix (see § 3, 3, e).
Cf. also pi-kiki-    ΤΟ SOUND L I K E A SLAP ON T H E BUTTOCKS (pi-'
WITH THE BUTTOCKS, § 20, 2), in which the same stem with ϊ- vowel
seems to have become assimilated by the i of the prefix. Perhaps
more frequent than any of these interchanges is that of ο and u(o);
this is apart from the purely phonetic interchanges already spoken
of (§ 3, 5, e). Examples are:pA'-so'roroi-tci   waterfall            curur'u-     to make a noise of

   (b) Functional interchanges. Two types of interchange occur, a
qualitative and a quantitative one. To the former belong the
change of an a, a·, o, or u of the singular verb stem to an i in the
plural (§ 53, 1, b); the alternation of semelfactive -i- with durative or
iterative -a- (§ 53, 1, c); and the alternation of active - a - with static
or medio-passive -i- (§ 53,1, d). The latter process, vocalic lengthen-
ing, is employed partly to indicate futility, partly in certain continua-
tive forms.
                     § 18.   Compounding of Stems.
   Both • compound nouns and verbs (including adjectives) may be
freely formed in Paiute. A large number are in constant and idio-
matic use, while new compounds can be constructed without difficulty.
The process of compounding is evidently very much alive in Paiute.
Triple compounds, i. e. compounds involving three independent
stems, are by no means infrequent (e. g. qava' (u)-xiVA'cL-väix-j HORSE-
TAIL-HAIR; qiica'-ri'ma-tiv™dcu- BLOOD-ROAST-ASK FOR). Even quad-
ruple compounds are not unknown. Nouns frequently lose an absolu-
tive or classificatory suffix when compounded (e. g. -tsi-, § 24,1, f; -vi-,
-p i-, -mpi-, § 24, 1, a and b; -vi- -pi-, -mp'i-, § 24, 1, d and e); e. g.
soyo'-φϊ MOIST GROUND, ΝA'-co'yo-mam- ΤΟ LIE COVERED OVER WITH
EARTH.","[88, 89, 90, 91]"
"  (2) USE OF SUBJECTIVE FORMS. The subjective enclitics may be
used as the subject of a non-subordinate verb or as the object of an
imperative (§ 52).     The animate dual -' . . .πιϊ-, however, of
which examples will be given separately, functions only as a subject,
sometimes also as a possessive. Subjective examples of enclitic
pronouns, attached both to verbs and to other parts of speech, are:im'yuntcar'oani    did I take a drink?

   tive? why do they always do so?
a'a'{i)Yuqwa(i)'yim""''i they (inv.) are good
7nwava'ami qari'p 'iya' there-they (inv.) dwelt   In connection with the use of second person singular -' certain
peculiar contraction phenomena are to be noted. Ordinarily the
pronominal -' does not amalgamate with a ' in the last syllable of the
word to which it is attached (e. g. from -ywa'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO
is formed ηα'υ,'ψναίχινα'αί'' GO THOU AND HANG THYSELF!), but in
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean    Language
           SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    185other cases such amalgamation takes place, so that no specific pro-
nominal element is apparent at all. This is notably the case with
interrogative -ru'a-, e. g.:
im'yiro'"" art thou drinking? ( < -ro'a- + -'; not -ro'a')
cu(w)a'ru' nyn o'c C maybe you'll dream
   Probably this difference of treatment has something to do with the
difference between inherent and accessory ' (§ 15, 1). Furthermore,
the pronominal       is lost in certain cases, notably after qatcu- NOT,
after demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5), and before ai- τ ο SAY and ani- τ ο
DO; a final -a is then elided before following a-. Examples are:
qatcu' n a 'n ia'ap-A not-thou say-negative, do not say anything
a'i(y) igiT a'iimA that-obj.-thou indeed say-usitative, you are indeed
   wont to say ( = ai-a- iy'ir, cf. a'ian iy'ir that-I indeed)

   so? ( = -jfoi' *ani-)
  The third person inanimate enclitic pronouns (-aqa- and -' . . .q wa-)
are very often used, as in English, in an impersonal sense, particularly
in references to the weather. Examples are:
u7)wa'(i)y'iaq A it is raining (said by one who sees it raining)
ui)wa'(i)'yiqwA    it is raining (said by one who does not see it rain)

  in qa 'yiami merely implied because of singular form of verb)

of transitive verbs, as subjects of subordinate verbs, and as possessives.
For their use in subordinate verb forms, see § 55, 1. Possessives,
exemplified only in noun forms, are treated below (4). Examples
of enclitic pronouns in a properly objective sense are:qu'qwi'tu'acuyaywanoani          would t h a t they (indef.) would shoot me!

              SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                          187   (4) USE OF OBJECTIVE FORMS AS POSSESSIVE PRONOMINAL EN-
CLITICS. In a possessive sense enclitic pronouns can be used only
with nouns. Inasmuch, however, as such an enclitic, even when
appended to a noun, can have objective (or, in most cases, also sub-
jective) significance, a theoretical ambiguity sometimes results. Thus,
a form like qam'anl HOUSE-OBJ.-I (or ME, MY) may be interpreted
as signifying either MY HOUSE (obj.) or I (DO so AND so το) A HOUSE.
The form of the whole sentence or the context generally removes
the ambiguity. In practice a noun with possessive enclitic is generally
followed by a postnominal article-pronoun, e. g. qani'an am MY-
HOUSE (OBJ.) IT, in which case no ambiguity is possible. Examples
of possessive enclitics are:purjqu'm my horse; qu'tcu'mpuyquTjwini my cattle (lit., buffalo-pets)
dci'ni   pA'tca'n-     cc'RI to*to'q wa'ar/q'i   this-me mocasin-my    it   patch
    (distributively)- for, patch these moccasins of mine for me

A'SI'a-(i)ya'Q WA its surface, bark (obj.)
nia 'viy'wa m,· aijA chief-possessed-their (vis.) he, their chief
pi{y)a""am'i their (inv.) mother
   Instead of -am'i- THEIR (vis.) and -' . . .m i- THEIR (inv.) are
sometimes found the corresponding singular forms -αηα-, -' . . .rjwa-.
This takes place, though not always, when the person referred to by
the enclitic pronoun precedes with the plural animate suffix -ψνϊ-
(-TO I-; § 48,1), evidently in order to avoid a double plural. Analogous
phenomena will meet us again (§ 41, 1, e; § 42, 2 and 5). Examples of
this ""number dissimilation"" in possessive forms are:
qum a'rjwia m,· αηΑ ma 'ai>LTjWA             husband-plural-objective-their   he
   ( = them; § 42, 2, end) chief-his (inv.; = their inv.); their-husbands

         The reflexive possessive -vi- occurs only in objective forms, i. e.
      after objective -a-, -ya- (§ 49, 1); after nominalizing -n a- (§ 25, 3); and
      after postpositions, which are syntactically equivalent to the objec-
      tive (§ 50, 3). The reflexive possessive indicates t h a t the possessor is
      the same person as the subject of the sentence. Ordinarily it refers
      to the third person, but it may also be employed in first and second
      personal references. Examples <)f its use are:

   (5) PLEONASTIC FORMS.        Double (or even more frequent)
expression of pronominal elements is very common in Paiute. Ex-
amples of the repetition of the subjective or objective pronoun, both
pronouns enclitic or one enclitic and the other independent, have
occurred in preceding lists. There is a marked tendency for the
objective enclitic pronoun to attach itself to the verb even if it is
elsewhere expressed in the sentence; in transitive sentences the
enclitic subject seems to be normally attached to the verb only in
combination with the enclitic object (§ 41, 2, a). Particularly char-
acteristic is the employment of enclitic possessives together with
genitives (i. e. objectives) of the corresponding independent pro-
noun, e. g.:n'i'mA pavi'lsini       me my-elder brother
maya'iA ραα'ατ/Λ h i m h i s - a u n t
pi 'xäSiTj'w'im imi'A pigs-thy thee, thy pigs
imi'A paa'i'ami thee aunt-obj.-thy, thy aunt (obj.)
   Pleonasm is abundantly illustrated also in nouns, which are often
anticipated or redundantly referred to by pronouns, independent or
enclitic. Of such usages also examples have already been given.
Particularly frequent is the occurrence of an objective enclitic pronoun
of the third person with an objective noun, e. g. ι SEE-IT HOUSE (OBJ.)
as equivalent of ι SEE HOUSE (OBJ.). In genitive constructions this
is almost the rule, e. g. ραα'ία η.ι qaniar/A AUNT-OBJ.-HIS HOUSE-HER,
HIS AUNT'S HOUSE; also paa'iarjA       qanl.","[202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207]"
"   Negative forms are generally preceded by the negative adverb
qatcv-, less often qa. The latter, though closely attached to the
following word, is not a prefix, as shown by the unaffected phonetic
treatment of the negatived word, e. g.:
   rii' qa q ari'ywa'"" I not stay-negative, I was absent
   mam u'c v qa yura'<t>Axqaq'wai't iini they are unconquerable
   qatcu- is evidently compounded of qa and an element -tcu- which clear-
ly goes back to spirantized -tu- (cf. usitative participle -vatä- < -va-t'i-,
§ 25, 6, c; and postpositions in -pa-tc . . .- < -pa-t . . . - , § 50, 4, 37);
this is proven by comparative evidence, cf. Mono gadu, garu NOT.
The noun, independent pronoun, or verb that is negatived is provided
with a negative suffix or negative modification of a verbalizing suffix.
All such negative elements contain a glottal stop. Somewhat
infrequently, negative forms are found unpreceded by a negative
adverb.",[270]
"   Before subordinating -qu- (§55, 1, e), -q ai- appears as -q a - (cf. §26,
1, a and b; § 30, 9); e. g. yaa'iyqw' aikaqoajjA AFTER HE HAD GONE OUT
HUNTING. For perfective participial -qanti-, see § 25, 6, d. Though
perfectly analogous in treatment to resultative -q ai- (§ 30, 9) and
perhaps etymologically related to it, it is in practice felt as a distinct
element, as shown by the occurrence of -q aijc ai- resultative-per-
fective, e. g.:tayo'isidiui-  to cause to cover        tjyj'tsidiuk-aik a had (evident-
   over on top                             ly) been caused to cover over
                                           on top   The perfective idea frequently takes on an inferential implication.
An explicit inferential present-perfect (HAS EVIDENTLY -ED) is formed
by combining perfective -q ai- with present -yi-: -q aiy'i-. In general
it seems that perfective -q ai- regularly implies lack of direct knowl-
edge on the part of the speaker, differing in this respect from enclitic
-(n)tca- (§ 19, 1, a). Examples of inferential -q-ai{yi)- are:ivi-   to drink                         ivi'k-aip-l   what was evidently
                                            drunk (by someone)

    (4) -va •-"", -mpa-n future, intentive. In ordinary indicative forms
this element generally adds an intentive or hortatory force to its
fundamental future significance (contrast -va n ia-, -mpania-         below,
5). In other forms, such as gerunds in -Ut- (§ 55, 1, a) and participles
(§ 25, 6, b), it seems to indicate mere futurity. I t is used also in simple
future statements that are conditional on other acts. Examples of
- v a - "" are:

below) or dubitative -vi -, -mpi- (see § 33, 2). The former, -va p 'iyai-
(-mpa p 'iyai-), indicates an act in the past looking towards the
future. Examples are:

regularly employed in mythical narrative. Narrative referring to a
relatively recent past makes use of enclitic -ywa- (§ 19, 1, b). With-
out doubt -p 'iyai- is compounded of past passive participial -p'i-
(§ 25, 5, b) and verbalizing -yai- το HAVE (§ 26, 1, b). This is shown
partly by the fact that -p 'iyai- is treated analogously to -yai- (e. g.
participial -p 'iyanfi-, § 25, 6, e; negative -p 'i'ai-, § 57, 2, c), partly by
the fact that -p 'i- and -yai- may become disconnected (e. g. -ρ ϊ-a-yai-,
see 8 below, diminutive -p 'i-tsi-yai-). Hence a form like a'ip 'iya'
SAID is     to    be   analyzed   as   SAY-PAST PASSIVE PARTIC.-HAVE,    HAS
SAID. In other words, Paiute -p-'iyai- forms are formally the synthetic
analogues of English perfects; the functions do not quite correspond
in the two languages, however.

-a-      (§ 2 4 , 2 , a ) , a n d p r e s e n t -yi-   (1 a b o v e ) ,   τ ο HAVE B E E N   KILLED
(BY ONE), therefore, as expressed by -piay'i-, seems literally to mean
το BE ONE'S KILLED ONE. I t seems to differ from the normal passive
narrative past (-t'ip-'iyai-) in more definitely implying an agent
and perhaps also in referring to a continued state in the present.
Examples are:pA'qa'yu-            to kill                              pAxqa'i}Up'iai' was killed (long

sort, compounded of narrative past -p 'iyai-, impersonal -t ua-, and
present -yi-, have been already referred to (§ 29, 14). What difference
there is between the -p 'iyai- and the -p 'iayai- forms with possessive
-a- (§ 24, 2, a) is not clear. As for the use of the present -y'i-, it is
very likely that the -yai- of -p 'iyai-, when final, is to be understood as

h a v e , § 26, 1, b, which implicitly refers to present time) and that this
implied -y'i- needs to be expressed after an inserted -t-mo-. In other
words, -yai- and -yai-y'i- have fallen together to -yai-, but -yait uay'i-
remains as such. Examples are:

                          § 33. Modal suffixes.
  There are only two specifically modal verb suffixes. Most modal
ideas, as we have seen, are expressed by the aid of enclitics (§ 19, 2).
The indicative has no special modal suffix; for the imperative, see §
52. For perfective -qai- as inferential, see § 32, 3.
   (1) -yv-, (-qv-,) -T)qv- irrealis. This element indicates that the
activity expressed by the verb is unreal, i. e. either merely potential
or contrary to fact (potential in past time). In the latter case it is
preceded by perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3) or narrative past -p 'iyai- (§
32, 6). I t is not used with present -yi- nor, it would seem, with future
-va·-71, -mpa-n.   Optative examples (WOULD THAT . . . . ! ) involving
enclitic -γα' followed by 'oai' have been already given (§ 19, 2, b).
Further examples of the irrealis are:
pay'i'k-w3 'αίχναηαχα      'oai' go-away-irrealis-he-then! he ought to
    go away!
ni' narja'i'aik a yA yaya'x Aqai%.u I anger-die-if-he cry (momentan-

            SOUTHERN P A I U T E , A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE              169
  The irrealis may be participialized by means of -p i-. Participial
-kvp-'i- is frequently used as a base in optative forms with enclitic
-cuyaywa . . . n oa- (§ 19, 2, h). Other examples of its use are:
'α'ίρηχυ ρ- ur uru""ai' good-would-participle it is, it would be good
   (somewhat as though one were to say H E IS A POSSIBLE SINGER
   instead of H E WOULD SING)
uru""axw' sv""aiyuxvp i be-would very-good-would-participle, (it)
   would be extremely good
piywa'royoq-o p lni (-qo•- < -yqo -'ί) my would-be-made-as-wife, I
   would take her as my wife (song form)
   A past participial irrealis, -kvpiyanii-, is also found, e. g.: pAxqq/-
urjqυυ""p'iyanfini who would have killed me
  (2) -vi·-, -mp'i·- dubitative. The dubitative verb suffix is fre-
quently accompanied in the same or a preceding word by an enclitic -'
(§ 19, 2, n). I t may be rendered as PERHAPS, IT MAY (MIGHT) B E
THAT . . . Future dubitatives in -vamp'i·- (-mpa mpl -) are common
but, so far as known, the dubitative suffix is not employed with other
tense suffixes. Examples of -vi -, -mp'i·- are:ίνί'νϊ   maybe (he) is drinking; ivi'vl·''1 maybe thou art drinking
   (didst drink); ivi'jf arn 'rar/wa'"" maybe we did drink
an iaxwan a'ivT qa'ya' what-preterit-I say-perhaps sing- subordin-

qwa 'yuiuava mpini they (impers.) will perhaps beat me, it seems I
   shall get beaten                    § 34. Order of verbal elements.
  At this point we may conveniently take up the question of the
order in which occur the various elements that build up a verb form.
Four main positions are to be recognized: prefix, verbal theme,
suffix (prevailingly formal in character), and enclitic. Each of these
positions may consist of more than one element. On the other
                         X Southern Paiute and Ute
170                                   SAPIEhand, only the second position is necessarily filled, though ordinarily
one or more elements of the third position follow. The order of
elements within each of the four fundamental positions is, for the
most part, rigorously determined. Fifteen positions may be recog-
nized within the third, though, needless to say, only a limited number
of combinations among these are intrinsically possible. The following
scheme will be useful for reference (the letters and numbers indicate
order of position):
  A. Prefix
    1. Adverbial prefix (§ 20)
    2. Reflexive prefix (§ 22)
    3. Instrumental prefix (§ 21)
  B. Verbal theme
    1. (a) Verb stem (or other stem if followed by Β 2); or (b) combi-
       nation of stems, last of which is necessarily verbal (unless Β 2
       follows) (§ 18, 2)>
    2. Verbalizing suffix (§ 26)
  C. Suffix
    1. Suffixes of voice and aspect: -ya- (§ 30, 1); -yi- (§ 30, 2);
       -qi- (§ 30,3); -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c); -wo- (§ 31, 2, b); -tea- (§ 31, 2, d)
    2. -tcai- (§ 31, 2, a)
    3. Causative -f-ui- (§ 29, 12)
    4. Indirective (or transitivizing) -rjqi- (§ 29, 11)
    5. Pluralizing suffixes: -qa- (§ 31, 1, c); -'ψνα- (§ 31, 1, a); -t-'i-
       (§31, 1, b)
    6. Suffixes of movement (§ 28); continuative -n'ni- (§ 30, 12)
    7. Momentaneous suffixes: -iju- (§ 30, 5); -qu- (§ 30, 7)
    8. Resultative -qai- (§ 30, 9); passive -t'i- (§ 29, 13)
    9. Perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3); usitative -mia-, -mi-n (§ 30, 10);
       -ml- (§ 30, 13). -m i-"" precedes -q ai-.
   10. Future -pa - (§ 32, 4), -pan-ia (§ 32, 5; -n-ia- probably best
       considered as belonging to position 14)
   1
     A 2 (or A 3) + Β 1 (a) + Β 2 may, however, be taken as unit and com-
pounded with preceding (non-verbal) or following (verbal) stem.          Indeed,
this extended verbal "" t h e m e "" m a y also include elements (chiefly 1 - 4 ) be-
longing to position C. It is difficult to give rules, as composition takes place
whenever two or more elements or groups of elements are felt as logically
combinable or psychologically equivalent. Composition thus s o m e w h a t
 breaks in on our order scheme.

   12. Narrative past -p'iyai- (§ 32, 6), which may be split into
       its component elements by possessive -a- (§ 24, 2, a) or diminu-
       tive -tsi- (§ 35)
   13. Impersonal -{-ua- (§ 29, 14)
   14. Tense and modal elements: present -yi- (§ 32, 1); present
       -qa- (§ 32, 2); modal -lev- (§ 33, 1); dubitative -pi- (§ 33, 2)
   15. Syntactic elements, embracing:
       (a) Nominalizing suffixes (§ 25); or
       (b) Subordinating suffixes (§ 55, 1)
  D. Enclitic, occurring in nine positions, one of which, no. 7, may in
     turn be subdivided into three positions (see § 19, 4; § 4 1 , 1 and 4)   There is some doubt as to the priority of certain positions in C;
thus, it may be t h a t 10 and 11 should be reversed or, as probably
mutually exclusive elements, grouped together. Aside from doubts
of this sort, there are a number of disturbances of the above scheme
introduced by the impersonal -iua- and the passive -t-'i·-. First of
all, when -( ua- is used as indirect object of indirective -r/qi-, it follows
position 4 and precedes position 5 (see § 29, 14). Secondly, -tua-
regularly precedes future -pa-(nia-)         (position 10), yet follows
position 12. Thirdly, the position of pluralizing -qa- (no. 5), which
regularly precedes e. g. momentaneous -rju- (position 7), is disturbed
in impersonal and passive forms. In these cases it falls between
positions 8 and 9, i. e. it follows passive -t-'i - but precedes perfective
-q ai- and impersonal -( ua-. Thus, with normal ivik arjuy'i- SEVERAL

KILLED and &v i'r)iiq{w)at-u'ayi- THEY (PLUR. IMPERS.) ASK.           Lastly,
impersonal -( ua- follows subordinating -Icu- (see § 55, 1, e) in spite of
the fact that subordinating suffixes (C, 15, b) regularly follow all
other verbal suffixes.
   I t will not be necessary here to give examples testing out the order
scheme, as they can be readily found by the reader among the numer-
ous verb forms scattered in this paper. The positions assumed by
diminutive -ist-, which seems to be treated rather irregularly, will
be referred to in § 35, 2.","[182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"
"   Post-nominal pronouns (or article-pronouns) are identical in form
with the shorter forms of certain of the independent third personal
pronouns (or demonstratives). T h e y are closely attached, though
not as phonetically amalgamated enclitics, to preceding nouns,
participles, adjectives, numerals, and pronouns, which they serve
to make clearly denominating terms. Frequently they hold together
a group of two or more words as a denominative unit, in which case
they may stand after the first word of the group instead of at the end.
T h e y are practically equivalent to postposed articles and are differ-
entiated according to number, visibility and invisibility, animate and
inanimate, and, to some extent, case. On the whole, case distinctions
are neglected and primarily subjective forms often function also as
objectives. This seems to indicate a tendency towards development
into true articles. Ordinarily an article-pronoun follows immediately
upon the denominating term, but sometimes an intervening enclitic
(pronominal or other) element separates the two, e. g.
qana'ritsnjwi'aq·      um'i    KANAB-PEOPLE-OBJ.-IT     (INV.)   THEY   (INV.),   THE

  The corresponding objective form is also regularly ayA, which
replaces theoretical aya'tA. Examples are:
pi(y)a'{i)yav ay αηάηνοα""      mother-obj.-own she (vis.; = her) she-
   with, with his own mother

  For ayA = ami, see 2 below.
  An unexplained variant of ayA is aywA, apparently used only after
objective forms, e. g.:
cina'ywavL(y) aywA coyote (obj.) he ( = him)
pavi'av aywA piywa'iA elder brother-obj.-own he ( = him, his) wife

""number dissimilation"" (cf. § 40, 4; § 41, 1, e), the corresponding
singular arjA. This dissimilation takes place after (sometimes before)

  The objective form, iya'iA, is also found as article-pronoun, e. g.:

correspondent of 'aiA (7 above) is 'oa'iA, 'wa'i.i, a properly demonstra-
tive form (§ 43, 5). I t seems to be more frequently used than
objective uR'i. Examples are:
qani'va'arfw oa'i' house-at-his (inv.) it (inv. obj.), at his house
pv'icu'tcuywap'iya'aik   w arjqa'q wicari 'oa'ia   understood-it (inv.)

   Related to 'oa'iA as A qa'iA is to 'a'iA (7 above) is u'qwa'iA, which
is also not infrequently used as inanimate invisible objective article-
pronoun. Examples are:

  There are four demonstrative stems, as already noted (§ 39, 1):
                                       w
a- THAT (indefinite); i-,  THIS; ma-, m a'- THAT (visible; referred
to); and u-, "" V - that (invisible). These stems are not directly
used as independent demonstratives (except for rather infrequently
employed adverbs; a·, ma·'; see § 60, 2, d; 3), but need to be combined
with other elements. The following types of demonstrative usage
may be recognized:   ( 1 ) DEMONSTRATIVE STEMS FOLLOWED BY POSTPOSITIONS.  These
are extremely common and correspond, in function, to inanimate
demonstrative pronoun + postposition. Examples are:
ava"" that-at, there (indefinite)
aru'q-WA that-under, under it
maru'x-WA that (vis.)-to, to it
mava""anA that (vis.)-on, on it
mwa'va' that-at, there (not far away)
ι(y)t'nu this-at, here, present ( < i- a'n u-)
'i'va this-at, here
'i'upathis-through,     in this direction
uvwa"", 'u'vwax that (inv.)-at, there (inv.)
o 'p a'"" (< u-u'p-a'""), °'o'xpa'a (<       'u'-up-a'"") t h a t ( i n v . ) - t h r o u g h , in
  yonder direction  ( 2 ) DEMONSTRATIVE     STEMS +     THIRD PERSON            PRONOMINAL              ELE-
MENTS. These forms function as independent third personal pro-
nouns (§ 39, 1); as article-pronouns (§ 42); and as enclitic third per-
sonal pronouns (§ 40, 1). There is nothing further to be said about
them here except to note once more that these personal demonstratives
often preserve their proper demonstrative force.
   ( 3 ) V E R B S OF DOING. These are nothing but derivatives in -n i-
(§ 26,2, b) of the demonstrative stems. The idea of DOING, ACTING fre-

           SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                   205quently passes over into that of HAVING SOMETHING HAPPEN TO ONE,
BEING. The verbs of doing are: an i- TO DO (indefinitely); mani'-,
mya'n i- τ ο DO (as indicated); in i'-, 'i'n-i- το DO IN THIS MANNER;
un i-, 'u'n i- τ ο DO IN THAT (narrated, unseen) MANNER. Examples
of these verbs are:

'u'n ivä p i do-future-passive partic., about to be done to  In their absolute form verbs of doing frequently function as ad-
verbs of manner. In this capacity they may be combined with
forms of similar morphology that serve as verbs of doing. Examples
are:
a'n i in that (indef.) way
man i'ntca yan %ni'7)U thus-preterit-him- I do-momentaneous, I did

  (4) SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.      From the demonstrative stems o- and
224                          X Southern Paiute and Ute
      206                               SAPIR      u- are formed the verbs of being: aro'a- το be (vis.) and uru'a- το
      be (inv.). See § 56, 1.
        (5) ai-, mai-. These are extended forms of demonstrative a- and
      ma-. They are used as independent inanimate demonstrative pro-
      nouns, particularly with verbs of saying, (talking, hearing). However,
      they are not ordinarily found except followed by pronominal enclitics.
      Their objective forms are aia·, maia- (probably < a-ya-, ma-ya-).
      As to usage, ai- is best translated as t h a t (indefinite), mai- as t h a t
      (quoted, referred to).
        Examples of subjective ai- are:
      a'inl nayqa'q aip ini that-my heard (partic.)-my, that (is) what I
         heard
      a'i(y)aq-A qu'qo'qwikanayum aRi that-it (vis.) shoot (distributively)-
         plural-verbal noun-your (plur.) it (vis.), that (is) it which you
         (plur.) shoot at
        Examples of objective aia- are:
      a'ian 'a'imi      that (obj.)-I say- usitative, that's what I always say
      a'ia y (fir 'a'imi' that (obj.)-he (vis.) indeed say-usitative, that's
         what he indeed always says
      'a'i 'iy'ir 'aik^A that (obj.)-thou indeed said, that indeed you said
          (for 'ai < 'aia', see § 40, 2)
        Curiously enough, objective aia- becomes ai- before the inter-
      rogative, the two elements combining as aitcu'a-, aintcu'a-, e. g.:
      a'itcnan (or a'infcuan) a'ik ?A that (obj.)-interrogative-I said, did
         I say that?
      a'intcua r) 'a'imi' that (obj.)-interrogative-he (vis.) say-usitative, is
         he wont to say that? does he really mean that?
         Subjective mai- is illustrated in:
      ma'in n\ni nar/qa'qaip'ini that (quoted)-my me heard (partic.)-my,
        that's what I heard
      mai'm imi nayqa'q ainA that-thy thee hearing, that's what you hear
        Examples of objective maia- are:
      ma'ian 'aik *A that I say
      ma'i(y) 'iy'ir 'a'ik -Λ that indeed thou sayest (mai < maia' as above)
        Parallel to maia- is m""a'ia-, e. g.:
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language
            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    207mwa'iAcampa ay 'aik--A that (obj.)-only-he say, that's all he says
u w
 m a'iAcampan niruyw ampa'xA that -(obj.)-only-me I-to talk, that
  only talk to me! stop talking to me!
   As we have already seen, aia- is also used as inanimate visible
objective article-pronoun: 'α'ΪΑ (§ 42, 7). Its parallel invisible 'oa'iA
(probably < u-a-ya-) is not used as independent demonstrative,
though it must be such in origin. For adverbial-connective use of
ai-, see § 60, 2, a; for 'οα'ΪΑ as modal adverb, see § 60, 3.
   (6) VERBS OF SAYING. Parallel to the demonstratives ai- and radi-
äre the verbs of saying: ai- το SAY (indefinitely) and mai- (mwa'ia-)
                                               u w
TO SAY THAT (which has been quoted); e. g. qatc m a' iar/wai' yucampA
NOT SAY-THAT-NEGATIVE-SUBORDINATING-ONLY,          ALTHOUGH NOT SAY-
ING THAT. Either these verbs result from composition with demon-
strative α-, ma- (m w a'-); or they are merely verbified forms of demon-
strative ai- and mat-.
                            Note on § § 39-43.
   The three classes of pronouns already discussed observe the dis-
tinction in the third person between visible (or present) and invisible
(or absent) forms. Nevertheless sentences occur, as may have been
noticed, in which the same person or object is designated now as
visible, now as invisible. To a large extent this seems to be due to a
desire to prevent the same phonetic group (""word"") from containing
both a visible and an invisible element (see, for combinations of
two enclitics, § 41, 1, e), but not entirely. Apparently the difference
between the two sets of forms tends to become a formal rather than
a strictly functional matter. Examples of such contradictory
sentences are:
imi'ntcu'a-ijA pini'Rai'iijWA   tiyi'vw'ia'm u'IJWA thou-interrogative-
   him (vis.) see-him (inv.) friend-obj.-thy he (inv.; = him), did you
   see your friend (inv.)?
toy^o'iMuHaqaifwaiyquywA       qu'qwi'tιιαηΑ      right-forehead-on-obj.-
   his (inv.) shoot-impersonal-him (vis.), (if) anybody shoots him
   right on his forehead
tava'iA mwa'vaq-A qan'juqWA        sun (obj.) there-it (vis.) sit-when-it
    (inv.), when the sun sets there                     § 44. Interrogative pronouns.
  Interrogative stems may he divided into two groups, those employed
denominatively (interrogative pronouns proper) and those employed
                       X Southern Paiute and Ute
208                                SAPiRadverbially or serving as base for adverbial forms. They are not
accompanied by the interrogative enclitic -ru'a- (§ 19, 2, f).
  ( 1 ) D E N O M I N A T I V E FORMS. Four or five denominative stems are
found: aya-, ini-, impi-, and αηια-; further ay a-, which is always
verbalized or adverbialized by suffixed elements.
  (a) arja- WHO? This interrogative refers to persons only. Its
objective form is ayaia-; its subjective plural is ayami- (see § 48, 1),
objective ayam'ia-. I t must not be confused with αηα- H E , THAT
ONE (§ 39). I t is perhaps to avoid this confusion that interrogative
aya- is apparently never used with postpositions; e. g. aya'ruxwA
denotes το HIM, not το WHOM?. The latter idea would have to be
expressed periphrastically (see § 50, 8). Examples of αηα- are:
ay aru""a who is? who is it?
ay aro""avi iyA who would-be this-one? I wonder who this is!
'ay an i'lc -A who does-so? who is it that does so?
at) aije- αηιρα'χαχα who says talking? who is that talking? (referring
   to one who is heard but not seen)
aya'i aro"""" whom ( = whose) is? whose is it? (contrast aya'iac-
   aro""a it is his)
ayai uywa'rux wA whom he (inv.)-to? to whom?
ayam,· aro""a who (plur.) are? who are they?
aya'm'iantca' pAxqa'yu whom (plur.)- preterit-thou kill? whom (2)
   did you kill?
  (b) in i-' WHO? WHAT? OF WHAT SORT? This is a generalized
animate interrogative pronoun, referring to an animal, an animate
being not known to be definitely human or animal, or a person of
undefined characteristics. Subjective in-i- sometimes appears as
unelided ini before aro'a- το BE. Its objective singular is inia-·,
subjective plural in iyw'i- (see § 48, 1), objective iniyw'ia-. Examples
are:
in- aro' i'y.i what is this (anim.)?
in i aro""a what is it (anim.)?
ini'ntcan niywu'runl     who-preterit-me person-make-me? who ever
   made me a peron? who ever respected me?
iniyw aro""a what (plur.) are? what are they (animals)?
ini'ywi aro"""" what (plur. obj.) are? to what (animals) does it belong?
  (c) impi-' WHAT (inanimate); objective imp'ia-. In all probability
impi- is connected with in i-·, for -pi- see nominalizing suffix -ρ-'i-, § 25,

WITH) ; it may also be used as a nominal base for verbal derivatives,
e. g. impi'yai- τ ο HAVE WHAT? impuru- τ ο MAKE WHAT? Examples
of imp'i- are:
imp ατο""α what is it (vis.)?
imp uru""a what is it (inv.)?
imp'i'a rjA fi'qa'va' what (obj.)-he (vis.) eat-shall? what will he eat
imp'i'ma' fiya'nivani       what-with-thou butcher-will? what will you
  butcher with?
imp'i'xai' what hast thou?
impu'ruyiarjA      what is he making?
   (d) ania- WHAT? This interrogative is used only as the object
of verbs of saying or mental activity, e. g.:
'ani'an 'aik -Λ what-I say? what did I say?
im αη ιΑ nan o'c ivätcf thou what being-wont-to-dream? what have
   you ever dreamt?
ani'a' cy.via 'i' what-thou think-present? what are you thinking of?
   Aside from its use as an interrogative pronoun, an ia- frequently
appears as a verb, ΤΟ SAY WHAT? AS such it is treated analogously to
ai- TO SAY. Examples are:
im 'ani'avatci thou wont-to-say-what? what are you accustomed to
  say?
an i Axqa r)A what did he (vis.) say? (for -qa- see § 32, 2)
'ani'axai' a'ik-?A say-what-subordinating-thou say-so? for what
   reason do you say so?

"         (2) F R E E ADVERBS. The adverbs of free position may be classified
      into temporal adverbs, local adverbs, adverbs of degree, and modal
      adverbs. They are employed either as true adverbs (e. g. qi'arjwt.
      ya""a YESTERDAY DIE(D) ), often serving as bases for postpositional
      suffixes (e. g. qwa'utuyvia- OFF-TO, THE OTHER WAY < qwau- O F F ) ;
      or, in part, as verbs (this is particularly true of local adverbs, e. g.
      twwa'imikupiya'       DOWN-MOVING-INCEPTIVE-PAST, COMMENCED TO GO
      DOWN).
         (a) Temporal adverbs:

      first in clause as peg for enclitics; of demonstrative origin, see § 43, 5
      and § 44, 2, c). I t is generally followed by enclitic -lea- (§ 19, 1, a)
      even when there is no reference to past time. Examples are:

preceding set of adverbs.

          (it) will be called ""vulva""
      qam'ivw'uitsi a' nia'ayan&'      rabbit-eye-noun suffix (obj.) thus
          name-having (obj.), being called (obj.) ""rabbit-eyed""
      paa'n-a·' my aunt, ho!
iyiR INDEED, TRULY. This common adverb tends to amalgamate
   loosely with preceding personal pronouns, independent or enclitic.
   Thus, rii' iyiR is generally heard as m'iyiR; imi- iyiR appears as,
   not i'm 'iyiR, but imi'tyiR (in general, -i- iyiR becomes iyiR); -ay
   iyiR often coalesces to -ay g'iR (stopped g is sometimes heard for
   y in others of these cases also). Present forms tend to take on
   preterital significance with iyiR. Examples are:
      rii' 'iyiR nfna'c i I indeed dream-present, I did indeed dream
      imi' ιχίτ uywaro""' thou indeed anim. sing.-is, you indeed have
          always been

      imi'ntcu'aq• 'iy'ir ivi'yu     thou-interrogative -it (vis.) indeed
         drink-momentaneous, you did drink it
iyqi"" INDEED (Ute form of iyiR, sometimes used also in Paiute)
'ja'i , 'oq'i' (objective inanimate invisible demonstrative in origin;
   see § 42, 9 and § 43, 5) frequently used adverb (generally post-
   verbal) of quite elusive significance. I t seems to have emphasizing
   force. I t is particularly common after iyiR (see above); with pre-
   terital -tea- and -γωα- (§ 19, 1); after gerund -t si- (§ 55, 1, a); in
   irrealis forms (§ 33, 1), particularly such as indicate unfulfilled
   desire (WOULD THAT . . . !); after futures in -pa - (§ 32, 4);
   after -ml·- ALREADY (§ 30, 13); and after substantive verbal -aq a-
   IT is (§ 56, 3). In many cases it seems to turn absolute or present
   verb forms to past tense forms (probably only by implication).
   Examples are:
      tvzqwi'y'aiyqiyiar}'am      'αη,ι shame-die-to-present-he (vis.)-thee,
          he is ashamed of you

"   (2) VERBS OF SAYING. The corresponding generalized usage of
verbs of saying finds less ready analogy in English. First of all,
ai-, particularly in its usitative form, frequently means το MEAN,
TO REFER το rather than literally το SAY, e. g.:a'inicu'a ij 'a'imi that-interrogative-he (vis.) say-usitative, is that
     what he is wont to say? he does not mean that
i'i'ijai a'imi-ka' this (anim.)-obj. sav-usitative-perfective, has been
    always referring to this one   F o r ai-   . . .nia-   τ ο THINK, s e e § 19, 2, d .
  Examples of ai- as generalized verb of sound and mental operation,
the precise nature of the reference being clear from the context, are:Mi iy'ir 'a'imi I indeed am wont to say = always have that dream
aya'n iyidsiTjiv a'ik-.i what-do-momentaneous-gerund-he (inv.) says,
  what happened to him that he says so? = what has happened to
  him to make him cry?
ava 'nf o·'p ac ipi-L a'iva nt'i it-at-being that (inv.)-in manner-same-
  like say-future-participle, (what is) there will be saying in just

                SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                  275
  the same manner = (everything that is) there (at the house) will
  be making the same sounds as ordinarily (so that people will not
  know it has been abandoned)   A number of verbs of sound or mental operation consist of ai- το
SAY preceded by some more specific word, e. g.            ampa'(i)yania-
ai- NOISE-LIKE SAY, T H E R E IS NOISE GOING ON; '(m id-CU- 01- WHAT
( O B J . ) - AGAIN SAY? ΤΟ TEASE.     Examples       are:ampa' (i)yani     a'ik -Λ noise is going on

   (ζ) Examples of the use of the incorporated noun as a predicate
of the subject are:

  A STICK. The distinction between types (T) and (ζ) is perhaps
  somewhat arbitrary.
   (??) The use of the incorporated noun as a predicate of the object
is not very common. Examples are:
quma-'     husband                        quma'xvni'ywA        to take him for
                                             a husband

   Enclitics, as already pointed out (§ 17, 2), may be attached to any
word in the sentence. The pronominal enclitic elements will be
treated later in connection with the independent personal pronouns
(§ 40). Here we shall discuss only enclitics of adverbial significance.
Except in certain specified cases, they regularly precede pronominal
enclitics.
   ( 1 ) ENCLITICS OF TEMPORAL SIGNIFICANCE.           T W O enclitic   elements
are used to refer to past time.
   (a) -tea-, -ntca-. This element refers to the recent past and is
often best translated by the English perfect. For the forms -tea',
•ntca' see § 7. Examples are:
tona't-ϊ team I have been hit
tavL tsdea rjani pAxqa'yuni having-hit-past-he-me kill-me; having hit
   me, he killed me (note t h a t -tea- here refers not to tavi'tsi- HAVING
   HIT, but to following pA'qa'rju- KILL)
witn""tsiatca r) qo'q wi bird- obj.-past- he shoot, he shot the bird
wa'qutcani qava 'x A two-obj.-past- I horse receive, I received two
   horses
tona'ntcani I struck (not long ago)
                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
88                                SAPIRimi'ntca' pi'pi'tci thou-past arrive, you arrived
u(w)a'n oyuntcA paiyu'yu over there-past return, has been there and
  returned from there
  If a pronominal enclitic is used possessively with the preceding
noun, the enclitic -(n)tca- follows (aside from -φϊ ONE'S OWN), e. g. :mqa'n intc ai)A mompa'qu father-my-past he roll-off, my father rolled
  off
but:
o·'cdsa r)a4>i quM"" arrow-obj.-past- he-own take, he took his own arrow   With interrogative ai- (§ 44, 2, c) -tea- apparently refers to present
time, e. g. a'iicarjWA WHERE IS HE? but there is probably an implied
reference to the past, e. g. WHERE HAS HE (GONE TO) ? It is sometimes
used with exhortative ivw'i- (§ 60,2,d), e. g. Wi'tcan ixa'"" LET-PAST-ME-
THEN, LET ME THEN!   (b) -ywa-, a general preterital element referring to more remote
time than -(n)tca-. For the form -ywa' see § 7. Examples are:
pA'qa'rpiywarjani I killed him (narrative form; contrast pA'qa'-
    rjuntca rjani I have killed him [just now])
rii'xwa'aqwA pA'qa'rjv I-past-him kill, I killed him
αη ι'αχιυ aiv'i qa'ya' what-past would-say while-singing? what did
   he sing?
aija'x uru""a who-past he? who was he? (-a: < -xw; § 13, 7, c)
rii'ywa' to'nA I-past punch, I punched (long ago)
  That -ywa- is no true tense suffix is shown by the fact that it may
be used with the verbal -y'i- suffix of present time (see § 32, 1), e. g.:
imi'xwar'uaqA      man'yqaiyiaq-A thou-past-interrogative-it create-
   present-it? didst thou create it?
ivi'yixwa j-ayA drink-present-past-it-he, he drank it (long ago)
   A broken form -ywa'a- (perhaps -ywa- + -a-, 3) also occurs.
Its morphology is not clear. Examples are:
iim'tsiywa'an wo""a 'ni then-past-I there-I, then I was there
ni'niaxwa'axain i qari'i' me-past-too sit-present, I too was seated
imi'axwa'axain i qan'i' thee-past-too-sit-present, you too (it was said)
   were seated

             SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                        89  For the objective form of the personal pronoun in the last two
examples see § 39, 4.
  ( 2 ) ENCLITICS OF MODAL AND SENTENCE-CONNECTIVE SIGNIFICANCE.
Several of these are used in idiomatic connections that do not readily
yield insight into their primary significance. I t is believed, however,
that the chief elements and uses are given below.
  (a) -yainta-, -ayainta- TOO, ALSO. These elements always follow
pronominal enclitics, when present. The form -ayain ia- is probably
compounded of -a- (see 3, a below) and -yain ta-; it is not at all clear
how it differs in use or meaning from -yain• ια-.^γαϊη • ia- itself is perhaps
compounded of -πια- (see d below). Examples of -yainta- ALSO, TOO
are:
rii'xain i I too
uijwa'c • uywain ι that one too
cv'yuxwain i still another one
riimy'i%aint     we (exclusive) too
tFqa'xw'aivanixaini     I also will go to eat
  Examples of -ayain-ia- TOO are:
riiywi'axaini ya'a'ilfa' person-too died
marja'iAcuaxain i urjwaru"" aru""anA his-too he-is being, he belongs to
   him too
  Sometimes -{a)yainta-     is elided to -(a)yain·, e. g.:
rii'axain   y/tu'va n i I-too will-do
    A frequent modal use of -yainta- is to indicate a somewhat un-
expected inference or an emphasis on an idea that might be questioned.
I t may then be rendered IT TUHNED OUT, IT SEEMS, INDEED, JUST.
Examples are:
mari'acuxwainC         qant'ptnt    naya'<j>Axqafpiya' that (house) -it-
    turned-out old-abandoned- house-like seemed
qan i'am 'ixain i απϊ house-their-it-seems it; their house, as it seems

90                                SAPIR     An example of doubly elided -yain- is:
a'in'mayaxain·     'a'ik -A that-he-indeed said, that is what he did say
  (b) -ya'a- THEN ! INDEED. This element, which follows pronominal
enclitics, has emphasizing force. I t is particularly common in
optative and hortatory sentences. Examples are:
ρα'α'ίχ.υ·η·ΐχα' 'oai' die-would-I-indeed (for 'oat' see § 60, 3), would
  that I might die!
paiyi'k• ujur/jv ijwaxa' 'oai' return-hither-momentaneous-would-he-in-
   deed, would that he might come back!

  first- house-make-go; go ahead, then, over there and first make a
  house
mv,ayaya '''xa'a that one, indeed
  (c) -ywa- SHOULD, OUGHT. This enclitic is doubtless identical
with preterital -ywa- (1, b above). When used as modal enclitic of
obligation or in mild imperatives, it is followed by enclitic -noa- (see
e below). Examples are:
(•u)mwaniiJfaim iaywar'iianoA thus- resultative-usitative-should- in-
   terrogative-probably; that is not how one should act, be
mwan Mvim iaywar'uan oA dit. except that -avi- ΤΟ LIE is substituted
   for resultative -lp ai-\ one should not be thus lying
qari""miaxwa'n oA sit-usitative-should-thou-probably, you shall stay
Wi'xwa yan oA go-ahead-should-him-probably, go ahead and—him!
   (d) -n ia- LIKE. This is one of the most constantly recurring
enclitics. Though its primary significance is that of resemblance,
it is employed in several fairly distinct nuances of meaning and
enters into many idiomatic turns of expression. Its primary meaning
is clearly illustrated in:
-ψΐί'ο ηπί naya'p a rjupiya' thus-again-like appeared, (it) looked just
   like before
αχα'ηϊηίαηι naya'<j>Axqa* how-like-I appear? what do I look like?
so ""itsini like a soldier
rmt'an in i like my father (note that -n ia- follows possessive -n i-
   my, but precedes subjective or objective pronominal enclitic; cf.
   second example above)
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language             SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    91  A dubitative tinge is often present, in which case -π ια- may be
rendered IT SEEMS, AS IT W E R E , AS THOUGH, e. g.:
pAxqa'yufi'qanfinia ' j a-/)A naya'vai' kill-passive-having-been-like-it-he
  seems, it seems that he has been killed, it looks as though he has
  been killed
qu'qwt'va p 'iyain'ni'aywA shoot-future-past-like-him, acted as though
  about to shoot him
άηα'ψυανϊηι coyote, it seems
  This dubitative tinge may become so deepened as to justify the
rendering of -nia- as PERHAPS, e. g.:
ti'ma'q Aqain an ιαταη 'urjwA roast-plural subject-perfective-verbal
   noun-like-our he, perhaps the one whom we have roasted
u'u'rjwani'aml tini'arjqiq a'aiml he-like-thee tell-to-perfective-thee,
   maybe he has been telling you
  The idea of resemblance may also shade off into that of limit or
emphasis, e. g.:
fina '""va ntim anatjqwan-laqA    bottom-at-being-from-like-its, from its
   very bottom
  A number of verbs, chiefly such as indicate states of mind, are
regularly used with enclitic -N IA-, e. g. fiijw'i-. . .nia- ΤΟ HURRY;
                           'i'itampaqa-. . .n ia- ΤΟ BE TIRED OF; at-. . .n ia- ΤΟ THINK (lit., ΤΟ
SAY, AS IT W E R E ; cf. ai- ΤΟ SAY); ar/waiya-. . .nia- TO BE DIZZY;
an-ia-q-a-. . .n ia- WHAT DOES ONE CARE? (cf. an ia- WHAT? § 44, 1, d);
nanicui-. . .η·ία- ΤΟ BE FIERCE; i-ywaru'a-qai- . . .n ia- ΤΟ BE
WILLING, READY. Here belong also many verbs of sound or sound-
imitation, e. g. ampaiya-. . .n-ia- ΤΟ MAKE A NOISE; so a-. . .n-ia-
TO   SOUND   LIKE   FLOWING   WATER; OTD O-. . .N IA- TO     BUZZ,   HUM;
oq w'e-. . .n ia- ΤΟ SOUND LIKE COUGHING; and numerous sound-verbs
with suffixed durative -ya- (see § 30,1). For -»-{β- with numeral stems,
see § 36, 1; with certain postpositions, § 50, 4: 7, 35, 39; with certain
adverbs, § 60, 1.
  Quite unclear is -n'nia- following demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5) in
cases like:
a'in'niayaxain- 'a'ik -A that-like (?) -he- indeed said, that is what
   he did say
   Its glottal stop is unexplained.

definite significance to this enclitic. I t seems to render a statement
either more doubtful or less definite in application. I t may have an
i m p e r s o n a t i n g function. I t is nearly always combined with either
modal -ywa- (see c above) or with an impersonal -tua- (§ 29, 14) in
its own or the following word. Examples of the former have been
already given; see also -cuya-ywa-noa-             (h below). When combined
with pronominal enclitics, -n oa- regularly follows except in the case
of -η ί- I, ME, which it precedes. Examples of -n oo- with 4 ua- are:
pa'i(ua(i)yin oam somebody calls me
uwa'n untcan-QA sotsi'yuiu'"" over-there-past-indefinite peep-somebody,
   somebody peeped over there
sa'a'i)qituava-n ia r)anoA make-mush-for-somebody-will-him-indefinite,

""mpa'i'campaminu        iona't""' a'va no-matter-thee-indefinite strike-
   somebody-shall, I don't care if you are struck
   An example of -re-οα- unaccompanied by either -ywa- or impersonal
-tua- is:
mwa'nintcu' tTqa'noA thus-interrogative eat-indefinite? that is not
  how to eat! (cf. f below)
  (f) -ru'a- {-tcu'a-, -ntcu'a-) INTERROGATIVE.       Examples of inter-
rogative -ru'a- are:
tona'va-n iar'oa Tja'rjA will he punch him?
ivi'y%ro'a a r t thou drinking?
qani'va""tcaro'a-i}a<l>i did he (arrive) a t his own house?

sari'tcUcu' aro'"" is it a dog?
ovi'tcu'a-iι ar ατο""ana rjA stick-interrogative-his it his-being? is it his
   stick
  Interrogative -ntcu'a- (used after i preceded by nasal, also after
demonstrative ai-) is illustrated in:
imi'ntcu'"" tümpa'ya'    thou-interrogative mouth-have? have you a
   mouth?
a'intcu'an a'ik -A that-interrogative-I said? did I say so?

            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                       93
  Sometimes the interrogative is used merely rhetorically, implying
an inference, e. g.:
um""a'nar'u(w)a yA n\'m a'yawantct.i)qimwf        those (inanim. obj.)-
  interrogative-he me hide-from-usitative? so it is those (clothes)

  I must be getting to be a medicine-man!","[103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111]"
"  (2) V E R B A L USE OF POSTPOSITIONS. All postpositions indicating
movement, also some indicating presence, may be and frequently are
verbified without further change in form. Formal verbal suffixes (e. g.
momentaneous -yu- and tense elements) are directly suffixed to the
postposition. Examples of such verbified uses are:
au'mituywa'a       it-back-from-thou! go out (of it)!
U
  'u'x-upa""p-'iya'      it (inv.)-through (-wpa-)-past; (he) went off
    through it (inv.), in yonder direction
uywa""vantiiywa.T)UpiyaK he (inv.)-on-to-momentaneous-past, (he)
    got on top of him
axa'va ntuxwa'"" what-at-to-thou? where are you going to?
nar/wa""aimiku p'iya'aim'i         self-with-movement-inceptive-past-dual,
    (they) 2 started to go along together
qa'tcu maa'n%T]wa'aik wA not that (vis.)-at-negative-it (inv.), was
    not there
   All postpositions may be participialized by means of -ft-"" (§ 25, 6,
a); e. g. -va nti-, obj. -va-nfia-, BEING AT ( - v a • - "" AT). Such participial-
ized postpositions are often employed where simple local phrases or
adverbs would appear in English, e. g. H E GATHERED STICKS THAT-
                     w                                                     w
AT-BEING-OBJ. (uv a'ntiA) instead of simply THAT-AT, THERE (vv a"").
Sometimes the participial form takes on a specialized significance;
e. g. U'VIA IT-ON, THEREON, THEREAT, but umu'a!nt'i (obj. umwa'ntiA)
BEING THEREAT, i. e. SOME OF IT. Participialized postpositions may
be followed by other postpositions, e. g. -va nfi-m a-nayqwa- AT-
BEING-ON-FROM, AWAY FROM.",[236]
"   (3) V E R B A L NOUN IN -na-.    Verbal nouns in -na- are freely
formed from all verbs and often appear in syntactic combinations.
More often than not, a verbal noun in -na- is used with a possessive
pronoun, often in a subjective or objective relative sense. When a
tense suffix is absent, it refers to present or general time. Futures
in -va-na- (cf. § 32, 4) and perfectives in -qai-na- (cf. § 32, 3) are also
very common. In the case of transitive verbs, the action is to be
thought of as passive rather than active, e. g. ampa'yanani MY TALK-
ING, WHAT is SAID BY ME. Nevertheless, the matter of voice does
not seem to be clearly defined in -na- forms. Examples are:ni'ni no'nam me carying-my, my pack
nirjw'i RUqwat uywaq an araTjWA person-under-to-plural subj.-verbal
   noun- our, our going under a person, our being beaten
w'a'yin a m· ur 'a-'i'niijucampA   shouting-their it silent-become-but,
    but their shouting became silent
to'o'ivi'oran'naTjw am bulrush-digging-his it, the bulrushes he digs
    (dug) up
rii' o'pa' αηι'υα η ι imi a'i'nami I thus do-shall thee saying-thy, I
    shall do as you say
tFqa'va n'arjw U'R eat-future-verbal noun-his it, his being about to
    eat, for him to eat
ngna'e-iva n ani what I shall dream
nqno'cjfainani what I dreamt
mwa'ij 'ani'k a 'ia'vuruijuqwainanl that-one do-resultative wounded-
    make-momentaneous-perfective-verbal noun-my, that one it is
    whom I have wounded  Cases of -n a- as noun-forming or adjective-forming derivative
without clear verbal force are uncommon, e.g.:
uru""anA being, property < uru'a- to be
wiyo'o*paq%nA vulva-perforated-verbal noun, vagina
ava""""nA much < ava'"" to be much
  For the idiomatic use of -n a-c-u- with verbs of doing and saying,
see § 62.
  ( 4 ) SPECIAL NOMINAL DERIVATIVES.    Here are grouped a few
nominalizing suffixes of more than ordinarily concrete significance.

        An isolated noun suffix -va-' occurs in narjqa'va-' EAR (absolute
      naj)qa'va<j>i) < narjqa- ΤΟ HEAR. Also isolated is -mpa-"" in tuyumpa-'
      SKY < tuyu-"" UP. Both of these are old Shoshonean elements, cf.

         (c) - N -, -t 'i·-, -nti - CANYON MOUTH. This suffix seems to be added

recognized as noun suffixes (or stereotyped compounded stems),
but to which no definite meaning can be assigned. Among these is
-n'nayqa- (cf. perhaps nayqa- EAR-ORNAMENT) in bird nouns:
qiri'n'nayqats·         sparrow-hawk
ova'n'nayqA           goose
         wa-(tst-)     occurs in:
A'ta'q     wats-      crow (cf. parallel        A'ta'p'its·)   -tea - occurs in:
u'qwa'tsa ts- small spider (cf. u'qwa'mpi                      tarantula)   (5) PASSIVE PARTICIPLES.      T W O distinct suffixes of closely related
meaning are frequently employed in Paiute to express the passive
participle, -p i- and -ρϊ-.  I t is difficult to say just what difference
of meaning there is between these elements, though they are not
used interchangeably. On the whole, -p i- seems to have a more
substantival force, -p i- a more truly participial one; it would be
incorrect to press this point, however. Moreover, -p i- is primarily
tenseless except when preceded by specific tense elements, e. g.
future -να -; -ρ ϊ- is always preterital. Both may be formed from
intransitive stems, though derivatives formed from transitive verbs
are naturally far more common.

   (6) ACTIVE PARTICIPLES. The primary form of the active parti-
cipial suffix is -ti-n. When unpreceded by a tense element, it refers
to present time or, particularly in secondary substantival uses, is
tenseless. Participles of explicitly temporal reference may be
formed from the present participle by prefixing appropriate temporal
suffixes to -ti-n. Animate plurals are formed by suffixing -m i- (§
48, 1, a), e. g. -rim 'i-.
    (a) Present participle: -fi-"" (-<«-""• after i; -ntci-n after nasal +      i),
-ti-n, -nfi-"". Examples are:

   (f) Animate plurals of participles.    Animate plurals of active
participles have been already referred to. They end in -fi-m 'i-. A
curious idiom allows of their use also as singulars. This takes place
when the participle refers to a person (or animal) that is singled out
from a number or is compared with others. The plural ending of the
participle, in other words, refers to the implied collectivity rather
than to the person explicitly indicated. Examples are:
qu'tca'p-oto'qwarimi   blue-round-adj. verb-partic.-plur., one who is
   blue around (as contrasted with others of different color)

  Analogous constructions are found in other than -fi-n forms, e. g.:

  person (as contrasted with others)                       § 26.   Verbalizing Suffixes.
   A number of verb-forming suffixes are in common use. They trans-
form noun, adjective, and demonstrative stems into verbs.
   (1) Elements suffixed to noun and adjective stems.
  (a) -yai-, -q ai-, -rjqai-, ΤΟ BE. Any noun or participle may become
a verb of being by means of this suffix, e. g.:
nitjwi-' person                        niywl'xaiYU while being a person
qani-' house                           qam'xai-ηυ house-be-momentan-

                                          und-like, if (you) are to be
                                         greater than I
   For negative - ai- NOT TO BE, see § 57, 2 c.
   Before subordinating -q u- (§ 55,1, e) verbifying -Icai- ΤΟ BE becomes
-ka -, e. g.:
a'ip atsiyai-   to be a boy            a'ip aisiya q uni   when I was a
                                          boy
   For corresponding negative -a '-q u- WHEN NOT TO BE, see § 57, 2, c.
  The active participial form of this suffix is -yanti-n, -q anfi-"",
-Tjqanfi-"". e. g.:
                           Southern   Paiute,    a Shoshonean                Language                     SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN                           LANGUAGE           133tA'qa      -'     to be flat                            tA'qa       'yanti   being flat, flat coun-

yu(w)a-'                                                yu{w)a    'axant'i  being level, plain
wTqanoi-'                to be circular                 wfqo'noikant'i        circular
  As may be seen from these examples, -kanfi-n        forms many nouns
and adjectives. Many of these participial forms, indeed, seem to be
more freely used than the -kai- verbs from which they are derived
   Compounded with indirective -iiqi- (§ 29, 2) this element seems to
appear as -ai- (cf. negative -ai- NOT TO BE, § 57, 2, c). -ai-rjqi- seems
to indicate το ACT L I K E —το. It occurs in:
                 to be coyote; to
c'ina'ywavi-ylfai-                                      φια'ψνανι'αίηφ,ί'     acts like coyote
   be amorous, ""mushy""                                      to (her); acts in an inordinately
                                                            amorous manner toward (her)
   (b) -yai-, -qai-, -rjqai- ΤΟ HAVE. This element closely parallels the
preceding in all its forms (including negative - a i ; subordinate - k a - q u - ;
negative subordinate -a'-qu-;      participle -kanti-n).    From the form
alone it is not always possible to tell whether the -kai- suffix denotes το
B E o r τ ο H A V E ; e . g . tümpv,i}f         ai-   τ ο B E A R O C K o r τ ο H A V E A ROCK.
Frequently, however, the theoretical ambiguity is removed by the
use of a nominal possessive suffix (§ 24, 2) before the -kai-; e. g.
sari      'tsiyaivätcf       WONT TO B E        A DOG, b u t sari'vurjquxwaivätci             WONT
TO H A V E A DOG (§ 24, 2, e). On account of their particular frequency,
forms in -a-yai- (§ 24, 2, a) are separately listed.
  Examples of -yai-, -q ai-, -rjqai- ΤΟ H A V E are:

This suffix, which is evidently closely related to the preceding, is used
with verb stems, particularly such as relate to time and the weather,
less often with noun stems. Examples are:tuywa-'      to be dark, night            tuywa'ru'int'i becoming night, at

   (2) Elements     suffixed to demonstrative   stems. For demonstrative
stems α-, i- (*'{'-), ma- {m""a'-), and u- (""'u'-) see § 43.
  (a) -ro'a- το BE; makes substantive verbs from demonstrative o-
and u-, e. g. aro'a- το BE (visible subject). Substantive verbs are
dealt with in § 56.

   (b) -ni- ΤΟ ACT, DO, BE. This suffix makes verbs of action or
manner out of demonstrative stems, also out of interrogative aya-,
e. g. an i- ΤΟ DO SO, TO ACT THUS; ayan-i- ΤΟ DO WHAT? TO ACT HOW?
For examples see § 43, 3. These verbs are often used absolutely as
adverbs of manner, e. g. aya'm HOW?
   (c) -n'i- (-n i'i-) verbalizing suffix appended to demonstrative
stem + postposition (see § 43, 1). From ίνα·- THIS-AT, H E B E , e. g., is
formed iva n 'i- το BE HERE. It is possible that this element is
identical with continuative -n-'i- (§ 30, 12); both are two-moraed.
Examples are:

                               § 27.   General remarks.
   The suffixes added to verb stems or verbalized bases (see § 26)
may be grouped into six distinct classes: suffixes of movement, of
voice, of verbal aspect, of plurality, of tense, and of mode. Many
of these may be considered as more properly formal than derivative
in character, but the line is in any case not easy to draw.

   In origin these are in all probability verb stems that have become
specialized as second members of verb + verb compounds (§ 18, 2, a).
This appears quite plausible in view of the fact that several verb
stems of movement (e. g. pay(a)i-n ΤΟ GO, pa(i)yi- ΤΟ RETURN) are
frequently used in composition in a quasi-formal sense.  (1) -ywa'ai-', -qwa'ai-', -yqwa'ai-' ΤΟ GO WHILE -ING, TO MOVE.
This is generally used only in verbs whose animate subject is singular.
For corresponding plurals the compounded verb-stem -mia- SEVERAL
MOVE is used (for examples see § 18, 2, a). Examples of -ywa'ai- are:nontsi-'      to fly                         nontsi'%w'a.i'   goes flying, flies

related to each other as momentaneous and durative (see § 53, 2, b for
momentaneous gemination). The two uses of -ywa'ai-, WHILE GOING
and το GO IN ORDER TO, are reflected in its plural correspondent
-m-ia-, e. g. qa'mia- SEVERAL SING WHILE ON (THEIR) WAY and
SEVERAL GO IN ORDER TO SING.   (4) -m'mia- CONTINUOUS MOTION. This element, which is perhaps
etymologically connected with plural mia- SEVERAL TRAVEL, is very
similar in significance to -kwa'ai- (a) and to compounded -pay(a)i-
WHILE JOURNEYING.       The idea of continuity, however, seems to
be more explicit. Moreover, the movement referred to is not neces-
sarily the straight-line movement of normal walking or travel, but
may be the periodic movement say of dancing. Examples are:poya-     to run                       po• yam mia.t        goes running,

                         § 29.   Suffixes of voice.
   There are two groups of suffixed elements that indicate voice, i. e.
direction of action with reference to subject, object, or indirect object.
The first group (1-9) is a primary series that is not freely used; that is
closely welded with the verb stem (often with internal stem changes);
that occurs in contrasting pairs of mediopassive (or intransitive)
and active (or transitive); and that, for the most part, involve at the
same time other ideas than that of voice, namely verbal aspect (see
3 below) and number. This group will be only listed here for con-
venience of reference and taken up later under other headings. The
second group (10-14) is used with great freedom and indicates voice
relations of a somewhat more external sort. Suffixes of the latter
sort are often appended to the former.  (1) -q-i- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of momentaneous aspect
and singular number (see § 30, 3).
   (2) -71-, (-ijqi-) mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of iterative-dura-
tive aspect (see § 30, 2).
  (3) -ya- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of durative aspect (see
§ 30, 1).
  (4) -tcai- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of primarily durative
aspect and of plural number (see § 31, 2, a).
   (5) -na- transitive suffix of durative aspect and singular number
of object (see § 31, 2, b).
  (6) -n'na- transitive suffix of momentaneous aspect and singular
number of object (see § 31, 2, c).
  (7) -tea- transitive suffix of plural number of object (see § 31, 2, d).
  (8) -a - final stem vowel indicating active voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -i- (9).
  (9) -i- final stem vowel indicating inactive voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -a - (8).
   (10) -rjqi-"" transitivizing or activating suffix appended to verbs
of primarily mediopassive aspect. It is particularly common with
preceding -q i-, -yi- (1 and 2 above) and generally occurs with an
instrumental prefix in the verb (§ 21). Before it mediopassive -i- (see
9 above) sometimes becomes active -a - (8); an -a- of the active stem

    (11) -rjqi-' indirective: το, FOR. This extremely common suffix
expresses dative or indirective relations and may be rendered το,
FOR, FROM, WITH, AGAINST. The indirect object is always animate.

cases the person of the indirect object is not really affected by the
action at all but is merely interested in it. Such ethical datives with
first person indirect object are frequently employed to indicate an
affectionate attitude on the part of the speaker, e. g.:
αχα'η iyqitjuqwaiyurii' ani'k a     what-do-for-momentaneous-resulta-
  tive-subordinate-me-thou do-so? what happened to you for me?

  In a considerable number of cases the indirective - r j q i h a s grown
so to the stem as to give a new meaning in which the indirective
idea is not very prominent, e. g.:
pitci-   to arrive                    pitcATjqi- to arrive to, engage
                                         with (cf. also uni-vitci- to do-
                                         arrive, attack)
nayuqwi- to reciprocally-shoot        nayu'q wiijqi- to fight

   (12) -iui- causative, freely suffixed to both transitive and intransi-
tive verbs. Examples are:

   Much less frequently -iui- makes causatives out of nouns, e. g.:

   A few survivals seem to indicate t h a t -tui- is but the geminated
form of an older variable -r'ui-, -t ui-, -ntui-, which has become
generalized for all cases. There seems also to have been an alterna-
tion between momentaneous -t'ui- andd urative -r'ui- (see § 53, 2, b).
An example of causative -ntui- is 'a'cmtui- τ ο LIKE. Causative
-r'ui- (durative) is exemplified in iyä'r'ui- το CAUSE TO BE AFRAID, TO
FRIGHTEN; with this contrast momentaneous iya'tui-         το FRIGHTEN
(at one moment of time).   (12a) -n-i- causative. This element occurs so uncommonly t h a t
it has not been found possible to determine its precise application.
Examples are:
yu'u'rumpiyai(y)aqaijA       leg-make-causative-past-it (vis.)-he (vis.),
    he made a leg out of it
naywi'qa'minip'iya'       self-cover-causative-past, covered (him)self

Ν A' SO'XO' ma'mp'iya' covered (him)self with moist ground, dirt (cf.
    also NA^sa'xu'map 'iya' covered self with dirt)
   In the last two examples, which are provided with reflexive pre-
fixes, it is to be noted t h a t the reflexive is better considered the logical
object of the causative suffix than of the verb; e. g. HE CAUSED HIM-
SELF TO BE COVERED, not HF. CAUSED TO COVER HIMSELF.                 Contrast,
with ordinary causative -tui- (12), navl' η ifuik • ai (y)ayan/ H E CAUSED
ME TO S E E HIMSELF, not HE CAUSED HIMSELF TO SEE ME. Possibly -n-i-
is best defined as an indirect causative, like -rjqi- (10, 11), whose -y-
is perhaps a reduced form of -ni-; e. g. HE MADE IT INTO A LEG,
HE COVERED TO HIMSELF.   (13) -ti -s passive; sometimes heard as -H-, but always two-
moraed. This suffix is freely used to make true passives out of
transitive verbs. Examples are:

   The last two examples illustrate passive participles in -t'i-ri-n (cf.
§ 25, 6, a). These differ from passive participles in -pi- and -p'i-
(§ 25, 5) in referring to passing or non-characteristic states. Con-
trasting with SA'pi'x-AtiRi, for instance, is SA'pi'xam ip i ONE WHO
IS ALWAYS OVERCOME (-m i- is usitative, § 30, 10).
   Passives may be readily formed from causatives, e. g. ivi'( uii}uti -
tca r)A D R I N K - C A U S E - M O M E N T A N E O U S - P A S S I V E - P R E T E R I T -   H E , HE   WAS
CAUSED TO DRINK.      Here the causative suffix precedes the passive,
as is to be expected. Curiously enough, the same order is followed
in causatives of passives, an indirective -rjqi- coming in between the
causative suffix and the passive - t i - , e. g.:

   him to be killed (for -nlui- cf. 12 above)
  In other words, the passive suffix can not precede the causative.
In the preceding examples the indirective is required to point to the
logical object as the indirect object, the passive of the verb itself
being apparently conceived of as the direct object, e. g. H E WILL-
CAUSE-BEING-CAUGHT TO-US.        That these forms are causatives of
passives, not, as would be inferred from their appearance, passives of
causatives, is proved by the absence of a plural subjective -q a- (see
§ 31, 1, c) in the first form above; this would be required if the fomr
were to be understood as WE SHALL B E CAUSED TO B E CAUGHT BY HIM.
   (14) -tu'a-' (-t' ua- ) impersonal. Verbs with impersonal subject
or, less often, object refer either to an indefinitely defined person or
to a collectivity, people in general. In the latter case, if used sub
jectively, it may be preceded by the pluralizing -qa- (§ 31, 1, c). The
impersonal suffix is often employed as the equivalent of the passive,
never simultaneously with it. It follows perfective -qai- and nar-
rative preterit -ρϊ(α)·γαί-, but precedes present -yi- and future
-va (nia)-    (see § 34). Curiously enough, present -yi- regularly

follows -tu'a- even in preterit tense forms (cf. also -p• la-yai-tua-y'i-; §
32, 8). As already noted (§ 19, 2, e), it is frequently accompanied
by enclitic -w oa-. Examples of subjective -t-u'a- are:
pAKqa'rju(ua{i)ylayA kill-momentaneous-impersonal-present-him, they
    (indef.) kill him, he is being killed

    tive-indefinite-indeed, it seems that people are eating
   As impersonal object -t u'a-' seems to be used only indirectly after
-rjqi-, e. g.:
qa'ijqitu'a(i)yini       sing-to-impersonal-present-I, I sing with them
   (indef.)
nayu'q-vjiyqiiu'a{u)x u          fight-to-impersonal-when, when fighting

   played with them
  These examples show that -yqi-i ua- generally denotes cooperation
with a group. Moreover, the two suffixes form a close unit, as they
occur before elements that would normally precede -t-u'a- alone (e. g.
-yw'ai- ΤΟ GO TO, narrative preterit -p 'iyai-, plural subject -q-a-);
see above examples.","[143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166]"
"                     § 30. Suffixes of verbal aspect.
   By ""aspect,"" a term borrowed from Slavic grammar, is here meant
the temporal range of the action, i. e. its definition with respect to
such concepts as momentaneousness, durativeness, inception, itera-
tion. These and like concepts have no primary connection with
the concept of relative time, which is the province of the temporal
suffixes (§ 32).
              Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean    Language
           SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                       149   Among the ideas expressed by aspect suffixes, those of momen-
taneousness and durativeness are the most important. Every verb
has a durative and a momentaneous form, the former being generally
the primary form of the verb, the latter expressed by internal con-
sonant gemination, glottalization, reduplication, the suffixing of
certain elements, or a combination of these. The durative, as its
name implies, expresses continuous action, action conceived of as
lasting for an appreciable length of time (e. g. ΤΟ DRINK) ; the momen-
taneous conceives of the action as taking but a moment of time (e. g.
ΤΟ TAKE A DRINK) . Following are a few preliminary examples of the
distinction:
       DURATIVE                             MOMENTANEOUS
qova'qwi- to break                     qo'po'qwi-
naya'va- to seem                     naya!p a -yu-
mantcu'ywi-na-   to crush            rnantcu'q wi-n'na-
yaya'- to cry                        yaya'ya-     to burst into tears
im!- to drink                         im'-jju-
qwatea'-ya- to splash about          qwA'tca'-q i- to splash (once)
iiyai- to take place                  tTqa'rj'wi-
nontsi'- to            fly            nontsi'-k-u-
  The various methods of forming the momentaneous exemplified
above are to be considered as more or less equivalent. No simple
rules can be given for all cases. One simply has to learn, e. g., that
such a form as *yaya'quplya* is not in use, but that yaya'xAp'iya
must be employed.
  The aspects that may be recognized in Paiute are the durative,
the momentaneous, the inceptive, the iterative, the durative-iterative,
the resultative, the usitative, and the continuative. Moreover,
ideas that belong to the category of aspect are sometimes expressed
by means of compounded verb-stems or suffixes of motion (e. g. the
cessative by -maupa-, § 18, 2, a; the continuative or durative by
-qar'i- ΤΟ SIT, -q wa'ai- ΤΟ GO OFF, § 28, 2). A careful study of the
nuances of aspect formation can hardly be given here. We shall
simply list the various aspect suffixes with examples. For momentan-
eous (and inceptive) verbs formed by gemination or glottalization,
see § 53, 2; by reduplication, § 58, 5. For iteratives formed by re-
duplication, with or without accompanying gemination, glottalization,
or both, see § 58, 4.
  (1) -ya-g durative of active intransitive (mediopassive) verbs.
By a mediopassive verb is meant one that expresses action without

150                                SAPIRdefinite agency, e. g. τ ο SHAKE (intr.), as contrasted with transitive
τ ο SHAKE and passive τ ο BE SHAKEN. Sometimes -ya- seems to be
used also with agentive active verbs. Examples of durative -ya- are:
riintci'yai  (it) shakes
piyo'xwai' (he) drags (it);     piyo'x Aqip'iya'aiywA      he came home
   dragging (it)
yiu'xwai'   moves around
yu'mu'x(w)Ap'iya'       (he) moved
qwimpu'xwai'      (it) wiggles
si'yu'xwai'   slides  T h e momentaneous correlate of -ya- is -qi- (see 3 below).
  T h e element -ya-g is very commonly employed in durative verbs
expressing a continuous sound of some sort, e. g.:
ampa'ya-       to talk
po 'yux Apiyain i there was a sound as of something going through
    (his) flesh (for -n ia- in these and other -ya- verbs, see § 19, 2, d).
fiijwa'vaya- to make a noise
ki 'yuxwa(i)yin i makes a noise like rattling coins
pa 'raxa(i)ym i (rain) patters
qu'pa'raxa-       to pop in burning
po 'n'noxwa{i)yin i sounds like drumming
no 'ruxwa{i)yin-C       sounds like a heavy object being dragged on a
    smooth level surface
                       •pi'T)kixa(i)ytn i sounds like dripping water
si·' yaxani'iylni      makes a rustling noise (for -n i'i-, see 12 below)  T h e momentaneous correlate of this -ya- also is -q i- (or -rjqi-).   (2) -γΐ-, (-ijqi-) durative-iterative, chiefly of active intransitive,
sometimes transitive, verbs. I t is often transitivized by means of
-yfi- (§ 29, 10). I t differs from -ya- in conceiving of the action as not
strictly continuous, but broken up into a rapid series. I t differs from
the normal iterative (expressed by reduplication) in t h a t the repeated
acts cohere into a single durative unit. Examples are:tarfwi'tciyc   keeps time by tapping with (his) foot
mavi'tSLji    claps hands
qinip uxwC ' (mouse) gnaws
ίΑ'ρϊ'η'αηα'χιηφί'    stamps (on the ground to make it smooth)

tan 'i'ntcixi'   keeps on shaking with (his) feet (cf. riintciya- under a)
tAxqi'uyiyqi'qap    iya'    (they) chipped (it) into small pieces
ovwo'qway(c)i'        (it) bounces up and down (like a rubber ball)
tuvwa'yaitcai-     several pull out (intr.), emerge
 Sound-verbs indicating a continuous series of sounds of like nature
may also have the -yi- suffix, e. g.:
quypa'ra       x(t)ik  a- several pop (one after another)
w'ini'ruxwL-         to make a noise on the rasp
wa'a'uxwi           barks
w'a'tciyiijupiya'           (he) w h o o p e d   A few such verbs have -ΐ)φ- instead of -yi-, e. g.:
pu'qwi'airjqiyin-L             (he) pants
puy'wi'rjqii'           (mouse, rat) makes a peeping noise
ki{y)i'r}qiV            laughs
   (3) - q i - momentaneous, chiefly of active intransitive and medio-
passive verbs. Transitive forms in -q i-ηφ-.     Morphologically, -qi-
is the regular momentaneous correspondent of -yi-, formed from it by
gemination (§ 53, 2 b); it contrasts with both -ya- and -yi- forms.
Examples of its use are:
tA'pi'tcAqiTjqi'qwA          to crush it by stepping on (it)
mina'qi          (one thing) break(s) off
tarii'ntciqii]qip'iyai{y)aq     A (he) shook it by trampling once with (his)
    feet
mava't A'qirjqi to burst by means of the hand
lAxqi'lfIqwirjqip'iyaiAxqa      ' mI they hit it so as to have (it) go to pieces
iu'pa'q    ipiya       (one) pulled out (intrans.), emerged
to'pa'q i      (one object) come(s) loose
si'yu'q    wi     to slide, slip
   Midway between properly momentaneous forms in -qi- and
durative forms in -ya- or -yi- are certain verbs in -q i- with non-
momentaneous form of stem, i. e. with ungeminated consonant.
These may be termed durative-momentaneous. Examples of dura-
tive-momentaneous versus momentaneous forms are:
qovo'q-WL- to break (intr.): qo'po'q wi- to break instantaneously
paya'q (a)i- to tear slowly (but in one tear): pA'qa'q i- to tear
                          X Southern Paiute and Ute
152                                 SAPIR  In such verbs -q-i- does not seem to alternate with -ya- and -yi-.
  Verbs indicating a momentaneous sound also have a -q-i- suffix, e. g.:
kiffca'q in i   (it) makes a sound as of when something is thrust
   through paper
sa'mu'qwiyini       makes a deep noise as when a stone is thrown into a
   well
qi 'k in-L (it) sounds like one tear of a rag
v'cu'q-WL whistles
   (4) -n a- durative transitive with singular object: -n'na- momen-
taneous transitive with singular object. See § 31, 2, b and c.   (5) -yu- n momentaneous. This is by far the most common mo-
mentaneous suffix. It follows most verb stems and is also employed
after many derivative and verbalizing suffixes. Examples are:
im- to drink                           ivi'yu to take a drink
maain-i- to touch (duratively)         maa'in-irju      to touch (for a
                                          moment)
qvni- to take (one object)             qwii'yu to pick up (one object)
maa-'vi'a- to be dressed               πιαα'νϊ'αηυ     to dress (intrans.)
07iqa-' to be red                      ayqa'r'uayu to turn red

                                          ceived as non-durative act)

                                          momentaneously, got near

ai-     to say                         a'ir/up'iya% spoke out   In particular cases -rju- n may take on an inceptive or cessative
significance, but its true force is never intrinsically inceptive or
cessative. Examples of these developments of the primary moment-
aneous idea are:
(a) toyoq-wi- to run                   toyo'qwnjui'   gets ready to run,
                                          starts to run

  These examples show that -i)u-n in the present (-yi-) may indicate a
momentaneous (or inceptive) activity that is just about to take
place (cf. the use of momentaneous forms in Russian to indicate the
future). The idea of imminent activity is still more explicitly
rendered by -quntsi-, compounded of -tju-n and diminutive -(ri)tsi-
(§ 35, 2). Thus, a form like trqa'quntsi- EAT-MOMENTANEOUS (IN-
CEPTIVE)-LITTLE,      TO B E   A LITTLE    OFF FROM BEGINNING TO         EAT,
easily comes to mean το BE ABOUT TO EAT. Examples of pre-inceptive
-r/untsi- are:qu'qwiyuntsilf oeni I am ready to shoot (for -ka- see § 32, 2)
ya'uqwirjunUik-A     (the sun) is about to set
A'pi'iTfunts komi I am about to fall asleep, I am sleepy  (6) -ij'wi- momentaneous (intransitive). This suffix, which may
be related to -yu-n, occurs only in two or three verbs, its durative
correlative being a rarely occurring -i- or, in one case, -q a-. These
verbs are:
         DURATIVE                                 MOMENTANEOUS
ttyai- to take place                      t'i'qaij'wi-
piyai-  to be left over                     piyay'wi-
cuwaqa-    to breathe                     cuwarfwi-      to take a long breath
    (7) -qu-, -ju-    momentaneous; inceptive. This element, like
-τμι-η, seems to be primarily momentaneous in significance and in a
number of verbs is used instead of -iju-"". Some verbs have both
-iju-"" and -q u- forms, generally with some idiomatic difference of
meaning. In many cases, moreover, -q u- is a properly inceptive
element, as in durative-inceptive -ya-q u-. What nuance of meaning
differentiates -q u- and -q u- is not clear. Presumably -q u- is more
definitely momentaneous in character (see § 53, 2, a, 3); as inceptive
it probably indicates a sharp moment of beginning.
   Examples of momentaneous -q u- are:
pA'qa-     to beat, kill                  pA'qa'qu-   to give a licking:
                                            pAxqa'yu-   to kill
wt'i-    to fall                          wV'i'q u- to drop down, fall out

normal inceptive of -m'mia- (§ 28, 4) would be -m'miaqu-, which
is sometimes found, e. g.:

   More typical, however, are forms in -miku-, e. g. :

activity which is the result of the action predicated by the verb stem;
e. g. το HOLD as resultative of το GRASP. Resultative verbs are very
common in Paiute. Examples are:

   Edward Sapir (1884-1939) has been referred to as ""one of the most brilliant
scholars in linguistics and anthropology in our country"" (Franz Boas) and as
""one of the greatest figures in American humanistic scholarship"" (Franklin
Edgerton). His classic book, Language (1921), is still in use, and many of his
papers in general linguistics, such as ""Sound Patterns in Language"" and ""The
Psychological Reality of Phonemes,"" stand also as classics. The development of
the American descriptive school of structural linguistics, including the adop-
tion of phonemic principles in the study of non-literary languages, was pri-
marily due to him.
   The large body of work he carried out on Native American languages has
been called ""ground-breaking"" and ""monumental"" and includes descriptive,
historical, and comparative studies. They are of continuing importance and
relevance to today's scholars.
   Not to be ignored are his studies in Indo-European, Semitic, and African
languages, which have been characterized as ""masterpieces of brilliant associa-
tion"" (Zellig Harris). Further, he is recognized as a forefather of ethnolinguistic
and sociolinguistic studies.
   In anthropology Sapir contributed the classic statement on the theory and
methodology of the American school of Franz Boas in his monograph, ""Time
Perspective in Aboriginal American Culture"" (1916). His major contribution,
however, was as a pioneer and proponent for studies on the interrelation of
culture and personality, of society and the individual, providing the theoretical
basis for what is known today as humanistic anthropology.
   He was, in addition, a poet, and contributed papers on aesthetics, literature,
music, and social criticism.

   Volumes I-VI of The Collected Works of Edward Sapir consist, for
the most part, of shorter papers; by contrast, Volumes VII-XV are
devoted to longer works of monographic nature — grammars, diction-
aries, text collections, and extended ethnographic accounts. Many of
these were published by Sapir during his lifetime; others were edited by
his students and published after his death; still others are now being
edited and published for the first time. The organization of each indi-
vidual volume in this latter group brings together, in most instances,
works on a single language and culture; in a few volumes, however, the
unifying element is one of linguistic family or of culture area.
   Preparation of these monographic volumes has been aided by grants
from the National Science Foundation (grant no. BNS-8609411), the
Phillips Fund of the American Philosophical Society, and the Wenner-
Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.
   Sapir received his doctorate at Columbia University in 1908, and
took up a position at the University of Pennsylvania. His first field
work thereafter, in 1909, was in Utah, with the Uncompahgre and
Uintah Utes. Back in Philadelphia in 1910, be obtained a much
greater amount of data on a closely related dialect, the Kaibab variety
of Southern Paiute, as spoken by Tony Tillohash, then a student at
Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. The major publication which
resulted from this work, Sapir's Southern Paiute Language — gram-
mar, texts, and dictionary — was written in 1917, but not published
until 1930 — 31; it is reprinted in the present volume. Permission for
this reprinting has kindly been granted by the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences. In addition, we publish here for the first time an
English index to Sapir's Southern Paiute dictionary, prepared by Wick
Miller, as well as ethnographic notes gathered by Sapir from his Ute
and Paiute consultants, here edited and annotated by Catherine S.
Fowler and Robert C. Euler. A topic index for the present volume
has been prepared by Jane McGary.
   The Editorial Board is grateful to Robert C. Euler, Catherine S.
Fowler, Jane McGary, and Wick Miller for their participation in the
preparation of this volume.

                            Introduction
   The Great Basin of the western United States was, aboriginally,
occupied mainly by tribes who spoke languages of the Uto-Aztecan
family, specifically of the Numic branch. In older literature, this branch
is also referred to as ""Plateau Shoshonean,"" and the term ""Shoshonean""
has been used for a putative larger grouping within Uto-Aztecan.
   Within Numic, three divisions are generally recognized. The Western
group includes language varieties labeled as Mono (or Monache) and
Owens Valley Paiute, in eastern California — plus Northern Paiute in
Nevada and Oregon, and Bannock in Idaho. Central Numic includes
Panamint (or Koso) in California; Shoshone in Nevada, Utah, and
Wyoming; and Comanche in the southern Plains. Finally, Southern
Numic consists of Kawaiisu in California; Chemehuevi and Southern
Paiute in southern California, Nevada, Utah, and northwestern Arizona;
and Ute in Utah and Colorado.
   The term ""Paiute"" itself, unfortunately, has no clear ethnic or lin-
guistic reference; nevertheless, the term ""Southern Paiute"" is well estab-
lished as referring to some sixteen Numic ""bands"" or subgroups which
share a geographical center in southern Utah. (For a survey of Numic
linguistics, see Miller 1986.) Among linguists, at least, it seems likely
that the currency of the term ""Southern Paiute"" has been reinforced by
its use in the title of one of Edward Sapir's most important works.
   Sapir's research on Numic began with a field trip undertaken early
in his career. After fieldwork on Wishram Chinook in 1905, on Takelma
in 1906, and on Yana in 1907, Sapir completed his doctorate at Colum-
bia University in 1908 and accepted a position at the University of
Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1909, with his student J. Alden Mason,
Sapir arrived in Utah to study Southern Numic speech, beginning with
the Uncompahgre Utes at Ouray Reservation. Finding that few Indians
there spoke adequate English, he soon moved to the Uintah Utes at
White Rocks (see Sapir's letter to A. L. Kroeber dated 7 September
1909, in Golla 1984: 43). A brief report, ""Some Fundamental Charac-
teristics of the Ute Language,"" was published in 1910 (Sapir 1910c,
reprinted in Volume V of The Collected Works).
   Back at the University of Pennsylvania in 1910, Sapir hoped to find
a Ute speaker at Carlisle Indian School near Harrisburg; instead, he
14                      X Southern   Paiute and   Ute
found Tony Tillohash, who spoke the Kaibab dialect of Southern Paiute.
Tillohash moved to Philadelphia for four months, providing Sapir with
much more comprehensive data than had been obtained on Ute (see
Fowler and Fowler 1986). Four short papers resulted shortly thereafter:
""Song Recitative in Paiute Mythology"" (Sapir 191 Od), ""Two Paiute
Myths"" (1910f), ""The Mourning Ceremony of the Southern Paiutes""
(1912c), and ""A Note on Reciprocal Terms of Relationship"" (1913c);
these are reprinted in Volume IV of The Collected Works. However, the
major descriptive result was Sapir's Southern Paiute Language — a
grammar, a text collection, and a dictionary — written in 1917, but not
published until 1930 — 31. This work is reprinted in the present volume,
along with a previously unpublished English index to the dictionary,
prepared by Wick R. Miller.
   Sapir's work on Numic linguistics is noteworthy from three viewpoints
in particular. First, his 1910 report on Ute described the typical Numic
phonological alternation of voiceless stops (p t k kw), voiced stops (b
d g gw), voiced fricatives (ß r γ yw), and voiceless fricatives (φ R χ
Xw); in his work on Southern Paiute, Sapir not only found the same
alternation, but also confirmed Tony Tillohash's intuitive awareness of
the relationship. Reported in Sapir's famous article, ""La realite psycho-
logique des phonemes"" (1933c, in Volume I), this finding remains one
of the paradigmatic examples of modern phonological theory. Second,
Sapir's Numic data made possible a historical study, ""Southern Paiute
and Nahuatl"" (1913f and 1915i) — his first important work in the
comparative/historical study of American Indian languages, and a pi-
oneering application in the New World of the Neogrammarian meth-
odology established in the Indo-European field. All subsequent activity
in comparative Uto-Aztecan linguistics is founded on this work of
Sapir's. Third and finally, the Southern Paiute grammar itself has come
to be recognized as a monument of American descriptive linguistics: a
model of accuracy, clarity, thoroughness, and insight which later schol-
ars have striven to emulate.
  In addition to data on language, Sapir collected ethnographic infor-
mation from his Numic consultants, and organized these materials with
eventual publication in mind. The resulting manuscripts had an ""un-
derground"" existence after Sapir's death, being consulted by several
ethnographers. They have at last been edited for publication in this
volume, by Catherine S. Fowler and Robert C. Euler, whose introduc-
tory essay explains the detailed circumstances.
                               Introduction                           15  Little has been published on the Southern Paiute language since
Sapir's day; however, there is significant work on the Ute dialect of
southern Colorado by Goss (1972) and Givon (1979, 1980); and on
Chemehuevi by Press (1979). There is an unpublished dissertation on
Southern Paiute by Bunte (1979); see also Bunte (1986) and Bunte and
Franklin (1988). Proposals for the reanalysis of Sapir's data on Southern
Paiute phonology have been published by Harms (1966), Rogers (1967),
Chomsky and Halle (1968: 345-351), Lovins (1972), Cairns (1978),
and Franklin and Bunte (1980). Manuscript vocabularies for a number
of Numic dialects, collected by J. W. Powell during his nineteenth-
century expeditions, are given by Fowler and Fowler (1971).
  Important ethnographic sources include Stewart (1942) for both the
Ute and the Southern Paiute, Kelly (1964) for the Southern Paiute, and
Smith (1974) for the Ute. Volumes on Chemehuevi ethnography and
oral literature have been published by Laird (1976, 1984). Recent surveys
of ethnographic and historical information are provided by Kelly and
Fowler (1986) for the Southern Paiute, and by Calloway et al. (1986)
for the Ute.

               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean   Language
                             PREFACE.
   The following sketch of Southern Paiute, which was completed in
December, 1917, is offered as a contribution to the scientific study of
the Shoshonean languages. Whether or not it proves to be fairly
typical of the whole group in phonologic and morphologic respects
must be left to future research.
   My first field acquaintance with Shoshonean linguistics was gained
in a short trip during August and September of 1909 among the
Northern Utes of Uintah Reserve, Utah. This trip was undertaken,
with the collaboration of Dr. J. A. Mason, under the auspices of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. A number of Ute texts
were secured, supplemented by considerable grammatical information.
To extend and deepen the insight into Plateau Shoshonean linguistics
then obtained it seemed advisable, indeed necessary, to undertake
further researches. Hence arrangements were made by the late
Dr. G. B. Gordon, Director of the Museum of the University of
Pennsylvania, with the authorities of the Indian school at Carlisle
to have one of their Paiute students, Tony Tillohash, put a t my
disposal for the ethnologic and linguistic study of his tribe. I worked
with Tony, who proved to be an excellent informant, in Philadelphia
from February to May of 1910. A series of texts, much supple-
mentary grammatical material, a large number of songs, and con-
siderable ethnological information were obtained. The Paiute
linguistic data proved so much superior to the Ute which I had
previously secured that I have decided in this sketch to limit myself
to the former. Moreover, there is enough phonetic, lexical, and
morphologic difference between Ute and Southern Paiute to render
the attempt to describe both at the same time confusing. I hope to
publish a briefer sketch of the Ute language at some future date.
   The present volume is to be followed by a series of Southern Paiute
and Ute texts and by a Southern Paiute vocabulary. I t is a great
pleasure to recall the unflagging patience and helpfulness of Tony
Tillohash and the kindness with which Dr. Gordon did all that lay
in his power to make these studies possible. My thanks are due Miss
Jane McHugh, the Secretary and at that time Acting Director of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, and the authorities of the
Museum for permission to have these Paiute studies published by the

              Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean     Language
    SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE.
                  § 1.   Distribution and Literature.
   The Shoshonean dialect t h a t is more particularly treated in this
paper is Kaibab Paiute, spoken in southwestern Utah and north-
western Arizona. The name Kaibab is an Anglicized form of the
native qa'im vitci ""mountain-lying, plateau."" The Kaibab Paiutes
are only one of a large number of tribes or bands in southwestern
Utah, northwestern Arizona, southern Nevada, and southeastern
California that have been loosely grouped together as Paiute proper
or Southern Paiute. The linguistic differences found in the speech
of the various Paiute bands are slight. Paiute itself belongs, accord-
ing to Kroeber's terminology, to the Ute-Chemehuevi branch of
Plateau Shoshonean, a branch t h a t includes, besides the Paiute
dialects, the Ute dialects of western Colorado and most of Utah,
Kawaiisu (spoken in south-central California), and Chemehuevi
(spoken in southeastern California along the Colorado; the Cheme-
huevi are probably nothing b u t a Paiute band that have been sub-
jected to strong Yuman influences). I t is doubtful if even the geo-
graphically extreme Ute-Chemehuevi dialects, say Uncompahgre
Ute and Chemehuevi, are not mutually intelligible with considerable
ease. The two other branches of Plateau Shoshonean are Shoshone-
Comanche (including Shoshone proper, Comanche, Gosiute, and
Shikaviyam, spoken in California) and Mono-Paviotso (including
Mono, Northern Paiute or Paviotso, "" S n a k e "" of eastern Oregon,
and Bannock). Southern Paiute and Northern Paiute should be
carefully distinguished; they are not dialects of the same language,
but distinct and mutually unintelligible languages. Indeed, Ute-
Chemehuevi differs from both Shoshone-Comanche and Mono-
Paviotso in important morphological as well as phonetic respects.
Thus, pronominal elements are suffixed (or enclitically affixed) in
Ute-Chemehuevi, but prefixed (or proclitically affixed) in the other
two branches of Plateau Shoshonean.
  The Shoshonean languages, according to Kroeber, comprise four
groups: the Plateau Shoshonean languages; Tiibatulabal or Kern
River, spoken in south-central California; Hopi; and a group of
southern Californian languages comprising the Serrano dialects, the
dialects of the San Luiseno-Cahuilla branch, and the Gabrielino

6                                       SAPIRdialects. The phonetic, lexical, and morphologic differences between
these four groups of Shoshonean languages are evidently considerable.
All the Shoshonean languages, taken as a unit, comprise the northern-
most representative of the Uto-Aztekan stock. This stock includes,
besides Shoshonean, Nahuatl or Aztec and the Sonoran or Piman
languages spoken in the long stretch of country between the Mexican
state of Jalisco and the Rio Gila (among these languages are Cora;
Huichol; Yaqui-Opata-Cahita-Tarahumare; Pima-Papago-Tepehuane-
Tepecano). So far as is at present known, the Uto-Aztekan languages
are not genetically related to any other American languages.
   The published material dealing with the Ute-Chemehuevi dialects
is scanty. We have some sketchy material of Kroeber's; 1 a phonetic
study of Southern Ute by J. P. Harrington; 2 and a brief abstract on
Ute by Sapir. 3 Some linguistic material on Southern Paiute is also
contained in Sapir's Song Recitative in Paiute Mythology,4 A compara-
tive treatment of Uto-Aztekan, primarily from the point of view of
Southern Paiute, is given in Sapir's Southern Paiute and Nahuatl,

"                         § 52. The imperative.
  The imperative is only negatively determined as regards form, i. e.
by the absence of tense elements, further by the frequent absence of
the second person singular in forms that have a pronominal or nominal
object. Syntactically, imperatives are remarkable in that they
take an object in the subjective form. The pronominal subject or
object, as usual, may be appended either to the verb or to a preceding
element, e. g. hortatory iVi'- (§ 60, 2, d). Examples illustrative of
these remarks are:
ivi""i drink-thou! drink!
avi'mituywa'""     it-out of-thou! go out!
iVi'"" ivi'yu hortatory-thou drink-momentaneous! go ahead, take a
   drink!

OVL m-αχιιηι stiek-give-me! give me a stick!

p.i'qa'yuayA sari'Hv aijA kill-hiin (vis.) dog (subjective) he (vis.)!

qwiri'k-ltsiaq• i'tci tVqa 'q-A arise-gerund (§ 55, 1, a)-it (vis.) this

vvwa'nfini    ya'yqihi     it (inv.)-at-being (subjective)-me carry-for-
   hither! bring me (it) over there!
  Imperatives with a dual or plural subject do not seem to occur with
enclitic pronominal subject, but arc characterized instead by an

236                                      SAPIRenclitic -ya-, appended either to the verb form or a preceding word.
In plural imperative forms the verb is plural in form; dual imperatives,
particularly if intransitive, frequently add dual pronominal enclitic
   . . .ml- to -ya-: -y'am'i-. Examples of plural and dual imperatives,
with and without pronominal objects, are:
ti''qa'q a(i)rA,     tVqa'qai*   e a t ye!
qatcu'i' minta'n'ia'p-A not-plur. imper. run (plur. verb-stem)- nega-
   tive! do not run away (plur.)!
tdyo'q wt.ya'ami run (sing. verb-stem)-imper.-dual! ye 2 run!
m\mwi'yani     to'nA ye-plur. imper.-me punch (sing, verb-stem)! ye
   2 punch me!
tona'y'ar/WA ye 2 punch him (inv.)!
i(y)e'nuq(w)a(i)ya q-A this-at (§ 50, 4, l)-plur. subject-plur. imper.-
   it (vis.)! here it is! (speaking to more than two; note idiomatic
   use of imperative)
wTqa'm\yaAxqa'ami        cover-plur. imper.-it (vis.)-dual! ye 2 cover it!
qatcu'ya-m'i yaywi""(y)ap-A     not-plur. imper.-them (vis.) carry (sing.
   verb-stem)-negative! do ye 2 not carry them 2!
   What is probably an emphatic imperative is sometimes formed by
appending enclitic -aqa- to the verb or a preceding word. In all
probability this -aq a- is merely an idiomatic use of enclitic pronominal
-aq a- IT (VIS.); it has the position of a pronominal enclitic. T h a t it
is not to be merely construed as a pronominal object, properly speaking,
is shown by its use with inherently intransitive as well as transitive
verbs. On the other hand, it does not seem to occur where the verb
has a true pronominal object. Examples of imperative -aqa- are:
qa-'aq-A    sing!
t.iy;)'q wi{y)aq·A      go ahead and r u n !
toyo'q wiya q-A        ye 2 r u n !
mvwa'yaq-A cv'paro'*   I-at-plur. imper.-it (vis.) assemble! do ye
  come together at my place!","[253, 254]"
"   Very frequently the interrogative is employed as an ironical method
of stating the negative, e. g.:um""a'ni-kaimiaywar'^noA thus-resultative-usitative-should-interroga-
   tive-indefinite? should one act thus? that is not how to do!
ηϊ'ηιατο'"" sA'pi'-^ava ni me-interrogative-thou overcome-shall-me! you

  ( 1 ) OCCURRENCE OF h,     Only such cases are here considered as
are not due to unvoicing of moras (see § 8).
    (a) Initial Aspiration.      Certain words t h a t begin with a vowel are
frequently heard preceded by aspiration, e. g. ai-, 'ai- τ ο SAY; demon-
strative α-, ai-, 'α-, 'ai- (see § 43), whence an i-, 'an i- τ ο DO; atei-,
'at&i- BOW. Comparison with other Shoshonean dialects suggests
t h a t in part, at least, these initial aspirations are the representatives of
a Shoshonean h-; e. g. ay a-, less frequently 'aya- WHAT? : Agua Caliente
haxa WHO? Initial ' is found also in certain interjections, e. g. 'q
SURPRISE; ' a a ' i b w i OH! Initial * does not function as a consonant,

hence does n o t prevent elision (see § 7); e. g. a'i                            ly'ir    'a'imt    THAT
INDEED THOU SAYEST, n o t                   ly'lR.  (b) Developed from -s·-, -c·-. This sporadic development occurs
only medially, never in a final syllable. T h e -h- is strongly aspirated
and seems to be particularly common after a voiceless vowel, e. g.:
imi'AcampA                 thee only                       imi""hampA
mam-a""caywoits·                 old woman            mam-a""        hay      waits-

  still sees
(negative -rjw'a- counts for two
  moras)
  (c) Inorganic -'-. Rarely is an inorganic -'- introduced before a
voiced consonant or glottal stop. I t m a y take on the timbre of
the preceding vowel. Examples are:
όίηα'ηιναφι               coyote                     CL        na'ηυιαφι

   (2) POSTVOCALIC w. An intervocalic -w- is ordinarily a glide
(see § 14, 3, a). When an initial w comes, b y derivation or com-
pounding, to stand after a vowel, it regularly becomes nasalized to
wa'arfi-          to shout                           fi 'ywa'arji-      to give a good shout

  This rule does not operate, however, when w becomes intervocalic
by reduplication:
w'iyi-          vulva                                wiwi'xiA            vulvas (obj.)

"   (3) PERIPHRASTIC CONSTRUCTIONS WITH POSTPOSITIONS.           While
postpositions may be used with noun stems (e. g. qani'ntcuqWA
HOUSE-UNDER), there is a tendency for postpositions to attach them-
selves by preference to pronouns and demonstrative stems. Hence the
type noun + postposition is often replaced by its periphrastic equiva-
lent: noun (obj.), pronoun (or demonstrative stem) + postposition;
the noun may follow. An independent objective pronoun may also
be thus periphrastically used with a pronominal or demonstrative
stem.

includes all elements that have been found on analysis. The entries
are made for simple postpositions, compounded forms coining under
the first element; cross references make clear the relationship of the
various elements.
     1. -a-"" PRESENT AT; occurs only as participialized -al l- BEING
PRESENT AT and   compounded: -an u- (cf. 25) PRESENT AT; -an u-yu-
(cf. 25, 49) MOVEMENT FROM; -atuywa- (cf. 30) ALONG TOWARD.
These elements occur only after demonstrative stems, e. g.:
i(y)e'nuan 'am'n'ni     this-at-I do-eontinuative-present, here I am
n(w)a'n oyuntcA pa{i)yü'yu      that (inv.)-at-from-preterit return, (he)

ηϊχα""ηι·χ.α""να.ίγυ    a t my side (something going on)
   4. -ya va'-) occurs only as participialized -yava't'i- B E I N G — E R THAN,
e. g.:

        it) with their canes
        10. -ma'ai- TOGETHER WITH (used with inanimate forms); obj.
      -ma'q u-. This is related either to instrumental -ma- (9) or, more
      probably, to local -ma- (7), as indicated by its parallelism to -ywa'ai-
      (11). Objective -ma'q u- is used when coupled with an objective
      noun. Examples are:
      'am a""aic u nana'piya'    it-with-again grew, (he) grew simultaneously
         with it
      ata'm 'aq-uq wa^i     bow-with-obj.-it (inv.)-own, (while holding) it

        11. -rjwa'ai-"" TOGETHER WITH (spirantized form of 10; used with
      animate forms), obj. -ywa'qu-. I t is doubtless related to -ywa- (8).

          (it) together with his wife (i.e. staked his wife too)
        For compounded forms, see 7, 8.
         12. -minarjwa- WITH (instrumental); probably compounded with
      -ywa- (8). I t is found only suffixed to objective naywa'q u- BOTH
      (§ 59, 3, c), e. g.:

also 2, 3, 30, 45, 48) occurs almost entirely in composition with pre-
ceding postpositions. I t is not properly a postposition itself, but is
likely to be etymologically identical with the verbal subordinating
-yu- (see § 55,1, c). The translation ACTING that has been given for it
in the preceding entries is only an awkward approximation to its
significance. I t seems to indicate t h a t the action of the verb takes
place under the circumstances indicated in the postpositional phrase,
which may thus be conceived of as subordinately verbified.

190                                        SAPIRIndependent and enclitic pronouns are often combined into a single
phonetic group or 'Svord,"" the independent or enclitic element being
either subjective or objective. Thus, instead of saying i'mi pAxqa'-
yumpa n ia r/A t h o u k i l l - w i l l - h i m , one can attach objective -αηΛ
to imi-: ϊτηί'αηΛ pA'qa'yumpani'               t h o u - h i m k i l l - w i l l . The follow-
ing types of combination occur:   (a) Independent subject + enclitic object, e. g.:rii""'imi pA'qa'yumpa n-i I-thee kill-shall
ni'rjuml mQi'mpa yumi I-you (plur.) lead-will-you

mam 'i'ntcaq-A NA'n'vi""'iaq-A they (vis.)-preterit-it (vis.) forget-it
    (vis.), they forgot it
  A variant of this type is that in which the independent and enclitic
pronouns are both subjective, the independent pronoun being used
predicatively, e. g.:
imi'ntcu'a q-A ni'niA p'iywa'ntuywaq ainan iani thou-interrogative-it
  (vis.) me ( = my) whom-depending-on-perfective-verbal noun-
  like-my, it is not you on whom I have been depending (for use of
  "" i t "" as equivalent of substantive verb, see § 56, 3)   (b) Independent object (possessive) +                enclitic subject, e. g.:
ηϊ'ηϊα' pn)wa'niv""a n-iani me-thou wife-make-will-me, you will marry
   me

mano'q- y,mw'i""am'i qvf'o'ip-'iya* all (obj.) them (invis.)-they (inv.)
   killed, they killed all of them  A special variety of this type is that in which the independent
objective functions as the subject of a subordinate clause, the enclitic
subject as the subject of the main clause, e. g.:
rii'niantca ijA tTqa'xuni yaya'x-A me-preterit-he eat-while-me cry
    (momentaneously); while I was eating, he began to cry (-ntca'ijA is
    logically cut loose from yaya'x-A, while rii'nia- anticipates -ni of
    fi'qa'xunl)

    would (the) earth appear? (im/ia- anticipates        . . .m, -' . . .q-WA
    anticipates fiv^ip-'i)  (c) Independent object + enclitic object. The first object may be
the subject of a subordinate clause, the second its object, e. g.:

   when, when we find it
urjwa'iAcu'qiVA mwani-tiil$aquT)WA         him (inv.)-it (inv.) that-do-

mam 'i'Acuaq A rwvi'k-a(u)x-u them (vis.)-it (vis.) cover (with bark)-
   plural-when, when they covered it with bark
  Or, conversely, the first object may be the logical object, the second
the logical subject of the subordinate clause, e. g.:
'i'tciarayfVA mama'aik    -A   this (inan. obj.)-us (inclus.)     find-when,
    when we find this
    Still other combinations are possible, e. g. independent possessive
+    object:

192                             SAPIR             § 41. Combinations of enclitic pronouns.
   Enclitic pronouns are often combined, the union of two such pro-
nouns being extremely common, that of three not at all rare. The
order of elements is rigidly determined by form, not by function (e. g.
-atjani- HE-ME, I-HIM, I-HIS, HIS-ME, MY-HIM, HE-MY). The resulting
theoretical ambiguities are generally resolved by the context, partic-
ularly as the pleonastic usages already referred to (§ 40, 5) give
opportunity for further limitation of the syntactical possibilities.
Thus, rii' -ayanl can only mean I-HIM or I-HIS; -aijani -ni (verb form)
can hardly mean anything but HE-ME. The following table gives a
survey of combinations of two enclitic pronouns; the horizontal entries
are subjective, the vertical objective. As a rule the pronominal ele-
ments are preserved intact, but certain modifications need to be
noted.
   The combined forms listed in the table apply not only to combina-
tions of subject and object of the same verb but to all other combina-
tions of subjective and objective, including possessive, forms. The
table also includes combinations of objective + objective enclitics,
insofar as objective forms are identical with subjective forms; e. g.
-ιaija'ami- HE-THEE, HE-THY applies also to HIM-THEE, HIM-THY, HIS-
THEE. Special double objective forms are:
-'mini- thee-me, me-thee
-Tjumini- you (obj.)-me, me-you (obj.)
-miriimu'i- thee-us (also us-thee, we-thee)
-rjuminimwi- you (obj.)-us (also us-you, we-you)
   (1) MORPHOLOGY OF COMBINED FORMS. The following rules are
followed in the combination of enclitic pronouns:
   (a) The combination of the first person singular subject and the
second person object, which should theoretically result in -mini-
and -Tjumini-, is simplified to - mi- and -tjumi- (properly THEE and
YOU OBJ.), the first person being thus merely implied.
   (b) The second person singular subjective element (-') always
follows an element of the first or third person, also the objective form
of the second person.
   (c) In all combinations of the first and second persons but those
coming under (b), the second personal element precedes (e. g. -rjw'ini-
YE-ME, -mini-    THEE-ME).
   (d) In combinations of the third person with either the first or
second person, the element referring to the third person precedes.

194                                    SAPIR   (e) In combinations of the third person, the singular animate
precedes the plural animate, while the animate is always preceded
by the inanimate. Furthermore, two a- vowels coming together in
composition do not contract to a- but to a' (or 'a); e. g. -αηα'ηα- <
-arja—|—arja-, -aq aya- < -aq a- -\—aya-.        "" N u m b e r dissimilation""
(cf. § 40, 4) takes place when two animate plurals are combined,
the first enclitic becoming singular in form; hence -auf ami- < -ami-
ami- as well as -aya-ami-, -ywa'm'i- < - mi-mi- as well as -rywa-mi-.
Such a form as -am'i'm'i- THEY 2-THEM (vi3.) is compounded of -am'i-
and animate dual      . . .mi-. A visible enclitic element is never com-
bined with an invisible one (e. g. -aya'ywa- is impossible). Should it
be necessary to contrast a visible subject or object with an invisible
one, recourse must be had to the separation of the subject and object,
e . g . uywa'c'uqw    ivi'van-ia-q-A    HE     (INV.)-IT   (INV.)   DRINK-WILL-IT
(VIS.), HE (INV.) WILL DRINK IT ( V I S . ) ; in combined form only           ivi'va·-
n iaAxqa'aijA   HE (VIS.) WILL DRINK IT (VIS.) o r                  ivi'vaniaqwa'ayiVA
H E (INV.) WILL DRINK IT (INV.) are possible.   (f) The objective reflexive possessive -v'i- has not been included in
the table. I t does not seem to combine with elements of the first
and second persons. I t is very frequently combined with enclitic
elements of the third person, which it follows: -ayavi-, -ywavi-,
-amivi-, -m'iv'i-, -aqav'i-, -qwav'i-.  I t precedes the animate dual,
however: -vi'imi-.
   (g) T h e animate dual, which is regularly subjective, follows all
third personal elements, including -vi- (see f above), but apparently
precedes the enclitics of the first and second persons. D a t a , however,
are quite imperfect for the latter cases. I t m a y be noted once more
that subjective animate plurals of the third person function as duals
if the verb is singular in form.","[207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212]"

   (e) Possessive and objcct. In most of the examples obtained the
possessive is attached to a noun + postposition or to a verbal noun
in - π α - (of objective force). The enclitic object is either the (direct
or indirect) object of the main verb or of a verbal noun (as in relative
constructions in pi-, see § 45). Examples are:

   (ye) shall put it in (your) own knees
  This type of construction can be used in relative clauses even with
primarily passive participial -p 'i- (§ 25, 5, b), e. g.:

the verb is doubly transitive, as with causatives of transitives, or
when it possesses a direct and indirect object. Examples are:

  (3) T w o   ENCLITIC PRONOUNS COMBINED WITH INDEPENDENT PRO-
NOUNS. M a n y combinations are theoretically possible.            The fol-
lowing have been noted:
  (a) Independent subject + enclitic object + enclitic object, e. g.:

  ( 4 ) U S E S OF THREE COMBINED ENCLITIC PRONOUNS.          T h e r u l e s of
combination can be easily formulated from those already given (see
1 above); e. g. -ay'amini-    HE (VIS.)-THEE-ME like -ay'am i- and
-' . . .mini-. The following types of combination have been noted:
  (a) Enclitic subject, first object, and second object, e. g.:
  x
pA qa' yqiyumpay' amini    he will kill thee for me
maa'intca ya'yan ni'nia ijA pA'qa'(u)x-u     find-preterit-him (vis.)-he

  (b) Enclitic subject, object, and possessive. The possessive enclitic
generally relates to a second object or to a noun with postposition.

USED τ ο HUNT.    I t is not obvious what difference in meaning, if any,
there is between usitative participles in -vatci- (§ 25, 6, c) and -m intt-.
Curiously enough, participles in -ti- may also be made usitative by
suffixed -m ia-, e. g.:

  it as fire
   (11) -η ·ϊ- η usitative, used only before past passive participle
-p i- (§ 25, 5, b) and its temporal derivative -p iyai- (§ 32, 6). Contrary
to phonetic rule, not -n 'ipKyai)- results, but -n 'impi(yai)-.
   Examples of usitative passive participial -η ϊηιρϊ- are:
p'ini'nu'iriimpiA (things) always seen about (obj.)
main'Lyunirnpiqwani     my always saying it (song form)
  The common use of -η ϊιη,ρϊ- as a means of forming instrumental
nouns has been already discussed (§ 25, 2).
  Examples of -n 'imp'iyai-, the usitative form of the narrative past,
are:
lint- to do                                 %ninimp'iya'     kept doing

  The suffix may be preceded, as we have already seen, by the common
usitative suffix -m-i- (see 10 above). Examples of the combined

forms -mip'iyai-, -nimp'iyai- and -m-in'imp'iyai-.     I t may be pointed
out, however, t h a t -nimp'iyai- does not seem to occur after momentan-
eous -7/W-, which requires a following -m-i-. This may imply that the
-7U-"" usitative tends to have a more strictly durative character than
-m i-"", which in turn may have a momentaneous -iterative color.   (12) -n'ni-' (-ni'i-') continuative. This is a common durative
suffix that, with verbs of movement, shades into a significance not
very different from that of -m'mia- (§ 28, 4). I t seems best defined
as a continuative, equivalent in meaning to such English locutions as
το k e e p -ING, το be -Ing. It refers to an act consummated at one
period, not, like the usitative, to one which is repeated at intervals.

   Number is expressed in the verb in four different ways: 1, by
reduplication, properly a distributive formation but frequently
expressing plurality of subject or subject (see § 58, 3); 2, by the use of
distinctive stems for the singular and plural, a few of the plural
stems being used only as second members of verb + verb compounds
(see § 54); 3, by the use of suffixes indicating plurality of the subject
or, less commonly, of the object; 4, by the use of suffixes expressing
ideas of number and voice (transitiveness and intransitiveness) at
the same time. Only the last two processes are here discussed.
   Even aside from pronominal elements, it is always possible to tell
from the form of a verb whether its animate subject is singular or
plural, often, also, whether its object is singular or plural. Verbs
with a dual subject are singular in form, but are differentiated in
practice from singulars by their employment of plural (or, in two
cases, distinctively dual) pronominal elements (§ 40). Thus,

         M a n y Southern Pauite m y t h s are characterized by the use of ""song
recitatives,"" t h a t is, set melodies to the tune of which the characters of t h e
myth recite their speeches. Not all myths, however, have such recitatives.
Thus, the story of "" C o y o t e and Porcupine"" (pp. 456-462) was explicitly stated
by Tony to be told without recitatives. This m a y be suggestive of borrowing
from the Utes, with whom this story is a favorite and who, so far as known,
use no song recitatives in their m y t h s ; the mention of buffalo in the m y t h
would also indicate t h a t it is of eastern provenience. Stories possessing song
recitatives may be presumed to be of a western provenience. See Sapir,
op. cit., pp. 471-472.
    Only two m y t h s were recorded with the appropriate recitatives: "" G r a y
Hawk and Toad g a m b l e "" (pp. 414-426) and "" T h e Badger People wage War
against Wolf and Coyote"" (pp. 432-444). T h e five types of recitative belonging
to these m y t h s have been given above. A supplementary set of six recitative
t y p e , is appended here with references to t h e m y t h s t h a t they belong to.
T h e speeches are given in the recorded m y t h s in the form of prose.

  I t should be noted t h a t the Paiute term translated "" C o y o t e "" in this and the
 following myths, cina'ywatt>i, is not the ordinary word for coyote, b u t is a
 special m y t h term. I t is evidently related to οϊηα""αφι ""wolf, dog."" The
 normal word for coyote is either ti'RAcina'αφι "" d e s e r t d o g "" or yoyo'v""'Us \ the

 Coyote in Ute texts.

April 26, 1912, p. 673). T h e significance of the animals in this origin legend
lies in the fact t h a t the mourning songs of today are classified into four animal
categories: "" r o a n , "" coyote, bird, and mountain sheep.

         I. e., every kind of mythological being destined to be transformed into

Journal of American Folk-Lore, vol. X X I I I , 1910, p. 363), the three others

unable to recognize it.

traces of the meat from showing on the earth. By burning the leaves and
branches he destroyed all traces of the butchering.
   *4 This incident argues a knowledge on the part of the Paiute Indians of
the custom of burning the dead. The custom, however, was not practiced
by the Paiutes themselves. This point may eventually help to determine
from what tribe or area the widespread story of the ""hoodwinked dancers""
came to the Paiute.

              This was not Coyote, first spoken of, but ""the idle Coyote,"" pro catamito
       usus in loco feminae. Coyote, on returning from the hunt, was the first to
       make use of him, after which he proceeded to the other camps. After the
       arrival of the Badger-wives his usefulness vanished. The Wolf and Coyote
       people had no women before this.
          81

      Eagle's song (see III, 1, p. 478) belongs to this story at a point antecedent to
      the events recounted in this fragment. The tale is a typical suitor myth
      and corresponds, in a general way, to Lowie's ""Lodge-Boy and Thrown-away ""
       (see Lowie, The Northern, Shoshone, pp. 280-283).

              When held down by the woman, Gray Hawk made a noise, thus leading
      Coyote to infer that something was wrong. He thought that Hawk was

        Mamputs, chief of the Cedar City Paiutes, is supposed to have been

 way of being friendly. An older man he addressed as "" f a t h e r , "" an older
 woman as ""mother,"" a very old man or woman as "" g r a n d f a t h e r "" or ""grand-

old enough to seek a wife.

"   (1) COMPOUND N O U N S . Compound nouns are most easily classified
with reference to the nature of the first and second compounded terms.
Triple and quadruple compounds are always morphologically binary,
one or both of the terms being in turn compound. Thus, the examples
given above are to be analyzed as HORSE-TAIL + HAIR and BLOOD-
ROAST + ASK FOR. Nouns stems, particularly in initial position,
sometimes appear in abbreviated form; e. g. rii-n PERSON < ηϊψνϊ-',
na-n TRAIL < naywa-', pa-' WATER < pa·-*. For mo'o-' HAND is
sometimes usedTOO-»(cf. verb prefix ma-', § 20, 2). The qualifying
element regularly precedes. Noun compounds whose second ele-
ment is a participle or adjective, though logically substantival, are
morphologically best interpreted as either verbs (adjectives) with
incorporated noun subject or object (see 2, f below) or, more fre-
quently, participial derivatives of such verbs (adjectives).

  Rarely the noun is found detached from its participle, e. g. beside
objective pa-ya'rinA, pa'-qarinA   LAKE we have also paa'iA qari'nA
WATER (obj.) SITTING (obj.).
  Rather different from these examples in inner, if not outer, form
are compounds in which the participle is freely used in a substantival
sense. They are really ordinary noun + noun compounds, in which
the logical emphasis is on the second element. Examples are:W'qWi-nt'i stream (lit., flowing)           A'ta'n uxqwint'i sand stream (i. e.
                                              ""stream with sandy bed,"" not
                                              ""streaming, flowing sand"")
tAxqa 'ya^nt'i being flat, a ""flat""         A'ta'RA'qayanti sand-flat (not
                                              ""flat sand"")
   Very common are noun + participle compounds in which the noun
is to be thought of as the object of the verb back of the participle.
Here again the compound is functionally a noun, the logical emphasis
being generally placed on the first element. Examples are:to'o'ivi- bulrush + ora-n ani        my     to'o'ivioran an UR my-bulrush-
  digging, my dug-up ones                      dug it, the bulrushes that I

qutcu- buffalo, beef +          iya'-p'i    qu'tcu""iyap 'i dried beef

  Such examples differ in inner form from compounds in which the
noun is an ordinary incorporated noun object of an active participle,
e. g. tumpwi-n      aT3'rjqwa-nt'i   STONE-WEARING, STONE-CLOTHES.

              SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                      77  (c) Noun + adjective compounds. Most adjectives are really verbs
(predicative) or participles of verbs (attributive). There are, how-
ever, a few cases of true adjectives with nominal suffixes (e. g.
-mp'i-, -tsi-) which, in compounds, follow the noun they qualify, e. g.:
qaru- house + itü-mp'i-     old        qam'itümp'i      house-old, old
                                          house

  (d) Noun + verb compounds. Nouns which are compounded of
a noun stem and a bare verb (or adjective-verb) stem are extremely
uncommon. They seem to belong to the ""bahuvrihi"" type. Examples
are:
wi'a-"" penis + NOxqo""mi to bend        m'a'n'N0zq""0'Mi       penis-bend,
   (intr.)                               bent-penised (personal name)

   (ordinarily toca-)                     River
   (e) Verb + noun compounds.         These are fairly frequent, e. g.:

                                         pack-dog

  Here must be included compounds of adjective-verb stems and
noun stems, which also are quite common, particularly in a ""bahu-
vrihi"" sense (sometimes nominalized by -tsi-, § 24, 1, f) and in verbal
derivatives in -leai- το HAVE (§ 26, 1, b). Examples are:

based on verbs compounded of verb (or adjective) + verb, e. g.
ar/qa'qwfcaM BED-FLASHING, LIGHTNING; and nouns compounded
of verb (or adjective) stems and participles that have substantival
force to begin with, e. g. ai)qa'paNUxqwint'i RED-STREAM (pa'NU x -
qwi-nt'i WATER-FLOWING, STREAM).   (f) Participle + noun compounds.         This type of noun compound
is not uncommon. Examples are:

                                            very good song
  The noun of the compound may, of course, itself be participial in
form, e. g. to'qwan-nu'qwint'i BEING BLACK-STREAMING, BLACK
STREAM.   (g) Adjective + noun compounds. Aside from adjective-verb stems
and adjective-verb participles, true adjectives may also be used as
the first, qualifying, elements of noun compounds, some of them
(e. g. αϊ-' NEW and i -s OLD) being apparently found only in such com-
pounds. Examples are:

   Some adjectives may precede the nouns they qualify as independent
terms, e. g. also mi.a""pi-is· qa'ni LITTLE HOUSE.
  (h) Numeral + noun compounds.       These are very common and
comprise one of the typical methods of expressing numeral relations.
For examples see § 59, 2, b.
   (i) Pronoun + noun compounds.  These are quite rare, including
terms compounded with interrogative ini-' WHAT KIND OF, WHICH
and qima-' OTHER, which has certain pronominal peculiarities (see
§ 39, 2). Examples are:
in i-' what + fiyiv'i-      friend      'ini'ntciyivini     what friend of
                                           mine?
qima-' other + qani- house              qima'xanini       my other house
      qima- may also qualify as an independent pronoun, e. g. qima'ric u
qani'ni       MY OTHER HOUSE.      (j) Adverb + noun compounds.     These also are rare.     An example
is:
tanU'vwai-       far west               tanfi'vwaiuvwia<£i far-west songs,
                                          songs borrowed from western
                                           tribes
   (2) COMPOUND VERBS. Verbs compounded with other independent
stems, particularly verbs and nouns, are extremely common in Paiute.
Under compound verbs are, of course, to be included adjective-verbs
and participles.
    (a) Verb + verb compounds.     A great many verb stems may be
used as the second elements of compound verbs. As to their morpho-
logical force, they seem to fall into two groups, those whose action
is to be thought of as contemporaneous or coordinate with that of the
first verb stem (here belong particularly verbs of position and move-
ment) and those upon which the first verb stem logically depends
as a kind of object (e. g. τ ο WRITE-PRACTICE, TO PRACTICE WRITING).
                           X Southern Paiute and Ute
80                                  SAPIH
It is not easy to draw a sharp line between the two groups. Not a
few verb stems are used chiefly, if not entirely, as second elements of
compounds. Some have become specialized in a quasi-formal
significance (e. g. -paiy'i- το RETURN, also το HAVE JUST DONE SO
AND so).
   Among the former group are: -aid- το LIE (sing.); -m ia- SEVERAL GO,
T R A V E L , GO IN ORDER ΤΟ; -nuqwi- ΤΟ RUN, START OFF;       -nu'i-kai-
SEVERAL STAND; -pay(a)i- το W A L K , in compounds generally WHILE
ON ONE'S W A Y ; -pa(i)yi- ΤΟ RETURN, BACK;- pan-ay a- SEVERAL RETURN;
-pitci- ΤΟ ARRIVE; -pini- ΤΟ SEE, LOOK; -puru- ΤΟ GO ABOUT, FROM
PLACE TO PLACE (cf. independent poro- SEVERAL J O U R N E Y ) ; -qa- το

-waywi SEVERAL STAND; -w'in'i- το STAND (sing.); -yuywi- SEVERAL
SIT. Examples are:-avi-     to lie                        ψιι'ανιχα'     while thus-do-lying,

have developed a non-concrete formal significance are illustrated
below:

   Such a second verb-stem needs only to drop out of independent
usage to take on the appearance of a suffix. This step has undoubt-
edly been taken more than once (see § 28).
   Under the rubric of verb + verb compounds are to be included
also compounds of adjective-verb stem and verb stem and of adjective-
verb stem and adjective-verb stem. Examples of the former are:
pdi-""     to be smooth                  pa 'ntA'ciu'kvdrjqi to slip on some-
                                           thing smooth

            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                        83  Examples of adjective-verb compounds consisting of adjective-
verb + adjective-verb (or adjective-verb participle) are:to·-"" to be black + -m'unuq wa -        to'm'unuqwap'iyaini           became

                                           ywayaR'i black-blue, dark blue    (b) Adjective + verb compounds.     Compounds of true adjectives
(not merely adjective-verb stems), including participles, and verbs
(or participles) are quite uncommon, except for compounds whose
first element is 'a't iGOOD, e. g.            ""'a'ttmpu'tcu'tcuywaplya'aikwA
                               a           x
WELL (HE) UNDERSTOOD IT; 'a't ümpA qar)Up'iyaiyar)A KILLED HIM
GOOD AND HARD; ""'a't tnayqap iya'aik WA or               a'tinayqAp'iya'aikwA
HEARD IT CORRECTLY, CLEARLY; ""'a'iiwa'atjintci              GOOD-SHOUTING,
GOOD SHOUTER.      I t is remarkable t h a t in most of these examples
""'a't-i-"" and the following verb are treated as accentually distinct,
i. e. the law of alternating stresses is broken. The doublets -τιαη-
qa'p'iya'aikwA    and -ncCtjqApiya'aikwA shows the struggle between
the force of analogy of the simplex and the regular operation of the
phonetic law.   (c) Pronoun + verb compounds.    Independent personal pronouns
are not compounded with verbs. Under this heading, however, are
included verbs compounded with quasi-pronominal qima- OTHER
(see § 39, 2) and verbs compounded of independent personal pronoun
+ -nc u'ai-n a 'ai- τ ο PAY NO ATTENTION TO. Examples are:qima-   other                           qim a'ntcikwa-rywa'* shall not be
                                           mixed up with others
-nc u'ai-n a 'ai- to pay no atten-      niru'c u'ain a·'"" pay no attention
   tion to                                 to me; αηα'mcu ain a 'a pay no
                                           attention to him  The latter examples are just as readily explainable as verbalized
pronoun + postposition (see § 50, 4, 29).

An example of a verb compounded with naijwa""""qu-n BOTH (objec-
tive in form) is naT)wa""""q umpAxqayu ΤΟ KILL BOTH (i. e. to guess
correctly both bone-positions in hand game).
   (e) Adverb + verb compounds. T h e adverbs here referred to m a y
occur also independently. There is no real line of demarcation
between them and specialized adverbial prefixes (§ 20). Examples
are:
nava'cu-      in vain                     nam'cup-A'qayu        to kill in vain
                                              (note accentual irregularity,
                                              cf. b above).
qatcu-     not + -tiyai- to become        qatcu'tiyaiy'ini   I not-become, I
                                              am becoming exhausted

                                              u p quickly
   (f) Noun + verb compounds.       These comprise examples of w h a t
is ordinarily known as noun incorporation. T h e absolutive or
classificatory suffix of the noun is frequently lost in noun-verb com-
pounds. The syntactic relation implied between the verb and its
incorporated noun may be of various sorts. T h e incorporated noun
may be an instrument; it may indicate similarity; it m a y function
as a direct object; it may have local significance; it may function
as the subject of the verb; it may be a predicate of the subject; or it
may be a predicate of the object. Any of these relations may be,
and more often is, expressed by properly syntactic or morphological
processes. I t is not possible to give a simple rule as to when noun
incorporation is possible or required, whether, e. g., to say Ι TRAIL-
SEEK or Ι SEEK A TRAIL. There is a good deal of option in this matter,
but m a n y cases of incorporation are fixed by idiomatic usage. There
is some tendency to express what might be called characteristic or
generalized relations by syntactic means. Any general and valid
rule, however, is hardly to be formulated.     (o) An instrumental     function is illustrated in:
tayu-"" thirst + paqa- to be sore,         tayu'p-A'qa-      to be sore with

                                         open with a knife
   The verb ya'ai- το DIE is idiomatically used with incorporated
nouns of instrumental function to express various unpleasant psychic
states, e. g. tu'qwt'-y'ai- το B E ASHAMED; ηαηα'-ί'αί- το ANGER-DIE,
TO B E ANGRY; ttyi'(i)-ya'ai- ΤΟ HUNGER-DIE, TO B E HUNGRY.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"
"   This assimilation takes place also after a syllable containing u (o):
-TU to make + -y'i- present tense           a{i)ya'ruyum     I make a turtle
-yim aywit uywa- away from                  uyu'm aywit ux fVA away from it
-y'i- + -n oa- modal enclitic               uwa't uywat-u'a(i)yon-oA    some-
                                               body is walking in that direc-
                                               tion
  Only infrequently does ϊ fail to assimilate to u. This seems to
occur sometimes when a glottal stop separates the vowels, e. g.rii'u'nantux-WA    OPPOSITE TO M E ;        yi'u-, yi'u-    LEG,   more often
yu'u-, yo'o-.
   (g) Consonantizing   before nasals.  This takes place, though less
frequently, under the same circumstances as the analogous con-
sonantizing of i (see 2, c above), but after a c:

( 4 ) MODIFICATIONS OF O:
  (a) Semi-unrounding.   Between two α-vowels an ο is sometimes
semi-unrounded and dulled in quality to a sound approximating that
of a itself. This quality appears to be identical with that of the
ω referred to above (1, c). Examples are:
-oayduywa-        around                 ace'ayduxwA    around it
oa- back                                 ρ/ϊ&α'ωαγαίρϊγα' had a          sore
                                           back
   (b) Palatalization. Rather infrequently we find ο palatalized or
""uinlauted"" to a true ö (mid-front-rounded, probably ""wide"")
after y:
{i)yovi-      mourning dove              (i)yö'vdcuA'isii}w'i little mourn-
                                            ing doves
  In Ute ö (both wide and narrow varieties) is found as the regular
correspondent of Southern Paiute ο (e. g. Ute οα'φι SALT: Southern
Paiute οα'φι).
   (c) Assimilation to u.      Sporadically ο is assimilated to an u of the
following syllable:
poro- several travel                     poru'qupiya'     several started out
  The compound form -puru-, like certain other examples of o-u
alternation, belongs rather to vocalic "" a b l a u t "" than to the purely
phonetic phenomena here discussed (see § 17, 7, a).
( 5 ) MODIFICATIONS OF U (alternating with O):
  (a) Consonantizing to w. Passage into the corresponding semi-
vowel w, when standing before a vowel, sometimes takes place:
u- demonstrative stem                    w'a'xava 'q WA into it
ui-Tjwa-yanti-, oi-ywa-yanti-     can-   wi'tpvayantimpaywi  in a canyon
   yon
   (b) Assimilation to i. An unaccented u is rarely assimilated to an
i, ι of the following syllable:
-c u- enclitic element ""also""            y.m""u'RU'qwayd uac m i           as
                                            though under them too
                                         {-c-un-L was also recorded)

              SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    15
    (c) Unrounding to ϊ. An unrounded u, i. e. ϊ, sometimes develops
after iy or before y, also quite frequently immediately before i.
This secondary ϊ may be further developed to i, ι (see 3, b). Examples
are:
tsi- with the point of a stick +    tsi' (y)i'm-uxwiplyaiyarjA      kept
   yum'mu- to poke                      poking him
-cuyaywa-n-oa- would that               -c'iyaywa-(-ciyaywa-,
                                       -ciyaywa)noa-
-(•ui- causative suffix             pim'fujfa'      caused to see
kwit v- anus + yoyo- to copulate kwifi'ioyot Ϊ           anus-copulating
   with                                 place, passive pederast
   (d) Assimilation   to ϊ.   Between two ϊ- vowels, u is rarely assimi-
lated to ϊ (ü):
ta 'i- shirt + -ru- to make            ta'""irüijqi'p'iyaiAxqaaijA made it
                                          into a shirt for him
   (e) Opening to o. Before, less frequently after, an a, u is some-
times broadened out to an open a:
ua- demonstrative + -ya- objec-        'οα'ΪΛ   modal adverb
   tive
-ru'a- interrogative                   iw'rjuntcar'oani did I take a
                                         drink?
-urai- toward                          αηα""oral'p'iya went towards him
moyoa- soul                            ?noyo'cupi soul
  As the last example shows, two successive o- vowels both tend to
develop to ο when one of them is so modified (cf. f).
  An original u (o) tends to become opened to ο before and after -y-.

develop regularly to -oyo-; e. g. yoyo- ΤΟ COPULATE WITH, toyο'αφ!

ο appears as ö (Ute ο is an open form of u, o), is necessary in such
cases to determine whether Paiute ο is primary or developed from o.
   (f) Assimilation to o.     An u (ο)- vowel assimilates to ο before a
syllable containing o:

  Infrequently u is assimilated to ο by the ο of a preceding syllable

   (1) VOCALIC CONTRACTION. Long, less often short, vowels some-
times result from the contraction of two short vowels or of a long
and a short vowel. The vowels may be either of the same or of
different qualities. We shall take up the examples according to the
quality of the resulting product.
  (a) Vowels contracting to a- (a).      The most common source of a
contracted a· is ο + a:
-ntcu'a- interrogative + aya- he       a'intcu'a yA that-inter.- he
-ntcu'a- Η—aqa- it                     imi'ntcu'a q-A thou-inter.- it
-ya- objective + -aya- his             tümpa'(i)ya yA his mouth (obj.)
-xwa- preterit suffix -|—aya-          ya'a'ixwa yA he died
-na- verbal noun suffix + -aya-        ora'n a yA which he dug up
-vu(y)a- usitative Η—aq-a- it          NA*ei'm'°'iaimya-q A keeps for-
                                          getting it
     Less commonly α· results from a- + o:
-mpa -    future + aya-    he          pAxqa'yqiyumpa y'am ini he will
                                         kill thee for me

            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                        17  Also ϊα is not infrequently heard as a·, a:
-ψοϊ- animate plural + -α- ob-        -ψνα-,    -ywa-

   + -a'pa-  negative
   An au, itself usually contracted from a + u (see b), is sometimes
further contracted to a· before qw, ijw, or ρ the labial vowel u being
absorbed, as it were, into the following labialized consonant but
leaving its quantitative value behind in the lengthening of the pre-
ceding a. Examples are:
na-urjwai- to hang oneself          na^ywaiywa'ai'' go hang thyself!
riivna-urjwa- to snow               nivwa'ywa p ly a it snowed
nauqwirjqi-   to       fight        na 'q wiyqi-
    (< na-yuqwi-yqi-, see § 13, 5, b)
  (b) Vowels contracting to ai, au.     This results when organically
distinct α and i, or u, combine:
quna- fire -|—i'ni- possessed         quna'i'niaraytVA    our      (inclus.)
                                        fire (obj.)
ma- t h a t -|—up-a'- in (such a)     ma'up-ain      that way
  way
  A long a- + i also contracts to ai. This is because organically
long diphthongs are not allowed in Southern Paiute. E. g.:
cTpu'v^a - cold water -|—in'ni-       ci'pu'v'*'ain intsiyaim-i'   is wont
  possessed                              to have cold water
  Apparently a- + u (o), however, remains as disyllabic a -u, e. g.:
qava·- horse + -wp ama-     like      qava 'op aniani       I (am) like a
                                        horse
  Had qavau- resulted, the above form would have been qava'upamani
(see § § 8 , 2, a; 10, 1).
   (c) Vowels contracting to i, i; i·. The ϊΐ, u, a which sometimes
results from an original ui (see § 3, 5, c) is sometimes heard still
further reduced to i :
-{•ui- causative suffix               na'a'it ip 'iya' made a fire
-r'ui- to become                      tuywa'r'ίηυpiya'   it got dark

18                                  SAPIR   Rarely yi advances beyond yi, yi (see § 3, 3, b) to contracted i:
-rjqi- indirective + -yi- present tuxqvn.""aiyqiir'on'i''  art thou
   tense                             ashamed of me?
   A long i·, not infrequently heard simply as i, i, appears as a con-
tracted product of i + i:
qivi- locust Η—in'i- possessed            qi-'un'inl   my locust
qani- house Η—i'ni- possessed             qani""nini    my house
   (d) Vowels contracting to ϊ·, ϊ. A contracted ϊ· sometimes results
from ϊ + ϊ, itself sometimes reduced from 'iyi (see § 13, 5, b):
fiy'ivw'i- friend                         ti 'vw'ia i)A his friend (obj.)
     Rarely does ϊ result from ϊ + u, which normally gives ir < u +
u:
rii- I + -u(w)a'mi-        in front of    ni'wctmi     in front of me
   (e) Vowels contracting to ii. This diphthong sometimes results
from ϊ + i, ν + i, or iyi (for loss of y, see § 13, 5, b):
cv yi - sugar + -i'ni- possessed          ον'χϋ'ηίηι my sugar
tiyia- deer                               ü'iaRUquatfri deer meat; pa-

   (f) Vowels contracting to o·, o. The contracted product a- results
from either ο + ο, assimilated from u + a (see § 3, 5, f):
u- demonstrative stem                    o-'ayd ux'WA around it
  + -oayduywa-    around
or from ο• + u:
po - trail Η—up·a' through               po-'p-a'"" through the trail
   Ordinarily, however, the u in the latter case keeps its distinctive-
ness, e. g. p 3 - ' x u p a ' a THROUGH THE TRAIL.
   The oa, oa- which sometimes appears as a broadened form of
original ua (oa), ua• (oa·) (see § 3, 5, e) appears also contracted to

from ο + i or a- + i, ο being itself sometimes a broadened form of u

  (2) VOCALIC LENGTHENING.           Several phonetic p h e n o m e n a m a y be
conveniently grouped under this head.   (a) Secondary lengthening. Very characteristic of Southern Paiute,
as contrasted with Ute, is the secondary lengthening of organically
short vowels. This seems to take place, strangely enough, more
often in unaccented than in accented syllables; it occurs with parti-
cular frequency in initial syllables, though found also medially. T h e
lengthening has neither morphological nor mora-determining (§ 9)
significance. Where advisable to indicate its inorganic character,
the mark of length is enclosed in parentheses, e. g. α(·). Examples
are:
ma- t h a t                              ma(-)va'aiYU       from there
pirywa- wife                             pi( ')ywa'ni      my wife

                                           from inside the house
   That, to take the last two examples, we are really dealing with
organic ta- and -ναψνί- respectively, is proved not only by the testi-
mony of the overwhelming preponderance of ta- and -vaywi- in other
forms but also by the treatment, as regards unvoicing, of the vowels
following the o( ). A primary two-moraed a- would have demanded
the incorrect forms: *nwwa'ta-mayaA'p'Cya and *qaru.'va-T)Wltuma-
nayqivA (see § 10, 1).   (b) Pseudo-diphthongal       or -triphthongal    treatment of long vowels
(and diphthongs).       Any long vowel, less frequently secondarily
lengthened vowel, may be pseudo-diphthongized, i. e. weakly rearticu-
lated: a"", i i, Ϊ ', v"" (o u, o""), :>"". Examples will meet us frequently,
so none need be listed here. All organically long vowels, whether
resulting from contraction or not, may be broken up into two short
vowels or even a short and a long vowel or a long and a short vowel;
e. g. organic a·, a"" may be further heard diphthongized to a a, aa·,
aa.    Throughout aa and o- are to be considered as phonetic equival-
ents, similarly for other vowels (e. g. y'i·' or yti"" DOORWAY). Examples
of broken-up long vowels are:-tea- preterit tense Η—αηα- he,          tona'iuatcaayanoA       some one
   him                                     struck him; ovi'nti'qay'wintca-
                                           a rjA he turned into wood
qvp-αηα- to spill water out of the       guv'payap'iya'aik-wA      (he) let
  mouth                                    it spill out of (his) mouth
   Analogously, organic diphthongs may be pseudo-triphthongized;
e. g. ai > aai, oi > ooi, au > aau.     Even secondary lengthening of
the first vowel is sometimes found: o(-)oi < oi. Examples of pseudo-
triphthongs are:
-p'iyai-   remote past                   sotsi'rjuplyaaic-u    again peeped
                                            out

being elided (see § 7, 1) or unvoiced (see § 8, 1, a), are sometimes,

                                             shut up!
    Medial vowels are also sometimes lengthened for rhetorical reasons:
qa'tcu not                                 qa 'tcu not so!

   Inorganic vowels frequently develop as glides before certain
consonants. These glides are often heard as full vowels, sometimes
as very weak vowels t h a t may be appropriately written as superiors.
I t will be convenient sometimes, to avoid ambiguity, to indicate
the glide by means of a parenthesis. The a and a which appear as
.glides before i after a guttural consonant preceded by ο or ο have
been already spoken of (see § 3, 2, a).
  ( 1 ) GLIDE i. This appears very frequently, one might almost
say regularly, before y after all vowels but i itself. The resulting
diphthong, however, always sounds briefer, less sustained, than the
organic i- diphthong; it does not count as two morae (see § 9) nor
can it be pseudo-triphthongized (see § 4, 2, b). Examples are:
na-yap a - to appear, look like            na(i)ya'p-a-yup'iya'    appeared
put cutcuywa-    to know + -y'i-           pu'tcu'tcuywa(i)'yiq-WA    knows it

22                                     SAPIR   In the last example the u of -rju- is unrounded before the glide i
(see § 3, 5, c).
   Here belongs also the not too common appearance of an i- glide
after ϊ (ϊ) or ο before a syllable with i (chiefly before -m- or -tsi-);
cf. the occasional assimilation of ϊ to a following i (§ 3,3, a). Examples
are:
ρϊηι- to see                               pl'ru'kaip'Lya' saw
mi{y)o-   a t a distance +         -tsi-   miyo""HsL- at a little distance

ized spirants or nasals {yw, xw, yw); before -yu-, -xu-\ and before
-vi. I t also appears after ϊ before v. The u- diphthong resulting is
inorganic (cf. above under 1). Examples are:

   Nasalized vowels are fairly frequent in Southern Paiute, less so
than in Ute. They arise from two entirely distinct sources. They
are either reduced forms of vowels + η; or they are due to the assimil-
ating influence of an immediately preceding or following nasal
consonant.

+ η to nasalized vowel occurs fairly often in rapid speech in Southern
Paiute; far more frequently in Uintah Ute, where it tends to become
the norm (particularly when the vowel is followed by ?jw); and
regularly in Uncompahgre Ute, where η does not occur at all. Ex-
amples are:αηα- he + -ywantuywa.- at             q 'ywantux wA at him (4· < qcinarjwavi- coyote

   Final vowels are never, except in poetry and in certain infrequent
cases also in prose, preserved as such. They are either wholly or
partly unvoiced (see § 8, 1), or else they are entirely elided or quantita-
tively reduced. The latter processes are operative before words
beginning with a vowel (a glottal stop or breathing preceding an
initial vowel does not take away from the vocalic beginning).
   ( 1 ) E L I S I O N OF FINAL SHORT VOWELS.  A final short vowel of the
ideally complete form of the word is lost, without qualitative or
quantitative trace, before a word beginning with a vowel. A pre-
ceding consonant is syllabified directly with the beginning vowel
of the next word; e. g. aruywa a'ip'iya' TO-HIM SAID becomes aruyw
a'ip'iya', syllabified a-ru-ywa'ip-pl-ya\     Examples are:

"   The text material presented in this paper belongs to two rather
 distinct, though closely related, dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
 branch of Plateau Shoshonean. The bulk of the paper is devoted
 to mythological and other texts obtained in 1910 (February to May)
from Tony Tillohash, a young Kaibab Paiute from Kanab, in south-
western Utah; the balance, to mythological texts and one tale recorded
in English, secured in 1909 (August and September) from Charlie
Mack, a Uintah Ute from White Rocks, Utah.
   The Ute texts were obtained at White Rocks in the course of a
brief trip among the Utes of Uncompahgre and Uintah reserves.
A further series of thirty Ute tales was obtained in English by my
colleague, Dr. J. A. Mason; these were published under the title of
"" Myths of the Uintah Utes"" in The Journal of American Folk-Lore
for July-September, 1910 (pp. 299-363). I should not fail to add
that Dr. Mason also obtained a series of interesting pictographs in
the course of a reconnaissance of Nine Mile Canyon, some distance
south of Uintah Reservation. This material is still unpublished.
   More substantial for linguistics than the Ute work were the results
obtained from Tony, who was in 1910 just about to complete his
course at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Through the
kindness of Dr. G. B. Gordon, the director of the University of
Pennsylvania Museum, and of the superintendent of the Indian
School, arrangements were made to have Tony housed in Phila-
delphia and employed at the Museum, so that he might be ren-
dered available as a source of information for further Shoshonean
researches. Tony proved an excellent informant. Though young
and absent from his native home for about five years, he was of a
naturally conservative temperament and possessed of a remarkable
memory. Hence he was better informed on the subject of tribal
lore than could normally have been expected. His unfailing good
humor and patience also helped materially to lighten a task that
demanded unusual concentration. (Indeed, in all my linguistic
experience, I doubt if phonetic perception has ever been so severely
taxed as in recording Shoshonean dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
group.) Besides the Kaibab Paiute texts here presented, there were

secured from Tony supplementary material for the grammatical and
lexical study of his language; a series of over two hundred songs,
chiefly ceremonial, recorded in text and on the phonograph; and a
considerable body of ethnological information. The grammatical
data have been worked up into a sketch of the Paiute language,
which forms the first part of this volume. The lexical material fol-
lows in the third part. The songs and the ethnological data will
form the subjects of future papers. Tony, further, proved valuable
as a first-hand source for a seminar in American Indian linguistics
that I was then giving at the University of Pennsylvania. Last, but
not least, he was a delightful companion at all times and is remem-
bered with the friendliest feelings by all who came in contact with
him in Philadelphia.
   The linguistic relation of Southern Paiute (to be carefjlly dis-
tinguished from Northern Paiute or ""Paviotso"") to Uintah Ute is
close. Indeed, they are not so much closely related languages as
mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. This probably
applies to all the dialects of Ute-Chemehuevi, which may be defined
as a dialectically differentiated Shoshonean language stretching from
Uncompahgre Ute in central Colorado to Chemehuevi in southeastern
 California. The texts embodied in the present volume are therefore
illustrative of one of the most widespread languages of aboriginal
 America, though the specific dialects of the texts, Kaibab Paiute and
Uintah Ute, cover only restricted territories in southwestern Utah
and northwestern Arizona and in northeastern Utah respectively.
No attempt has been made to normalize the texts, which are given
here precisely as heard. The phonetic system used is that described
 in the report of the Phonetic Committee of the American Anthro-
pological Association ; l the symbols are defined in the key prefixed to
 the texts. Those wishing to make an analytical study of the language
 are referred to the Paiute grammar which precedes; the necessary
 lexical assistance is given by the Paiute dictionary which follows.
    In their mythological affiliations the tales recorded here evidently
 correspond closely to the Ute, Shoshone, and Comanche tales already
 published by Kroeber, Mason, Lowie, and St. Clair. References to
 parallel tales have been confined to Plateau Shoshonean. Further
 parallels from other Plateau tribes, from Plains tribes to the east,
 and from California and Washington-Oregon tribes to the west are  1

given in the papers mentioned. On the whole, the relation of Southern
Paiute mythology to that of the Northern Shoshone is very close,
perhaps even closer than might have been expected.
   In conclusion, I should like to express my indebtedness to the
late Dr. Gordon's kind help which was given me throughout the
prosecution of my Shoshonean studies.

      u· long and open as in English poor, but without r-glide.
      I high-back-unrounded-narrow (Sweet's terminology); may be
            produced by completely unrounding close u, without
           modifying tongue position of u. On first acquaintance
           this vowel impresses one as a "" m u d d i e d "" nuance of ü,
           but its formation is quite unlike that of French or Ger-
           man ü. Its semivocalic form is γ (see below), to which
           it is related as u to w or i to v. ϊ, ii, and i are modified
            forms of ϊ.
      t high (or high to mid)-back-unrounded-wide; related to ϊ
           approximately as t to i or ε to e. I t is apt to sound like
           a "" m u d d i e d "" ö or a dull a.
      ü not a true ü as in French or German, but duller in timbre.

      i high-mixed-rounded-wide; approximately like i of English
           (American) first, but without r-quality.
      ö as in German schön or Götz (i. e. close or open in quality).

  •   and other superior vowels:
          weakly articulated, but not completely unvoiced, vowels.
          They are frequently glides, sometimes they are reduced
          from fully articulated vowels. After their own vowel,
          generally long, e. g. a "", they denote'' pseudo-diphthongal""
          rearticulation. Before and after glottal stops (') they
          are murmured in Paiute, after glottal stops they are
          whispered in Ute.
  A and other small-cap vowels:
          completely unvoiced vowels, pronounced with full
          breath. They may be defined as voiceless breath
          modified by various vocalic timbres.
  q and other vowels with subscript hook:
          nasalized vowels; nasalization is either weakening of η
          (see below) or secondary, due to presence of preceding or
          following nasal consonant. \y, nasalized w, occurs
          sporadically in Ute as development of i}.

  i,        weakly articulated, but not completely unvoiced, nasal-
          ized vowels.
  k and other vowels with superscript ' :
          glottalized vowels, i. e. vowels interrupted by a series of
          weak glottal stops. This type of articulation is some-
          times referred to as "" glottal r . "" w, glottalized w, occurs
          sporadically as development of u'. ä is secondarily
          developed from a' or 'a; similarly for other vowels.
  TJ, '{ unvoiced forms of >4, j; may be defined as voiceless
          nasalized breath with u and ϊ timbre respectively. This
          type of articulation is rare.
Diphthongs.
  ai, äi, äi, εϊ, oi, oi, ui pronounced as diphthongal combinations
         of a, ä, ä, s, ο, ο, and u respectively with following i.
         These diphthongs are either inorganic, i arising as glide
         before following y, or organic, in which case the first
         vowel is sometimes heard doubled, e. g. aai, ooi. In
         certain cases the two vowels are pronounced with a drag,
         indicated as a.i; in others, the i is rather faint, indicated
         as a'.
  a'l diphthongal combination of a and ϊ.
  au diphthongal combination of a and u (cf. ou of English

"                   § 23. Types of derivative and formal   suffixes.
   By ""derivative suffixes"" are here understood such elements as have
derivational rather than purely formal or syntactic value, i. e. such
elements as help to build u p the word as such from the stem rather
than to relate the word to other words in the sentence. Under
formal suffixes are not here included strictly syntactic elements.

Derivative and formal suffixes may be grouped into seven more or less
clearly distinct types of elements. 1. Noun suffixes, including abso-
lutive or classifying elements, elements defining possession, and tense
elements; 2. Nominalizing suffixes, generally suffixed to verb stems,
embracing agentive, instrumental, and verbal noun suffixes, certain
special noun-forming elements, and participial suffixes; 3. Verbalizing
suffixes, affixed to nominal, adjectival, or demonstrative stems; 4.
Verbal derivative and formal suffixes, affixed to verb stems, embracing
suffixes of movement, voice, verbal aspect, number, tense, and mode;
5. Diminutive -(n)isi-, suffixed to both predicating and denominating
terms; 6. Numeral suffixes; 7. Quasi-pronominal suffixes of special
nature. In general it may be said that the derivative suffixes of
Southern Paiute are, on the whole, of a general and colorless rather
than of a specific or concrete nature.","[128, 129]"

arjqa- to be red                     aijqa'n' NA'p'Cya'aik-WA (he) paint-
                                        ed it (primarily, but not neces·
                                        sarily, red)
saywa- to be blue                    saywa'n'nai'    paints (it) blue
sana-  gum                           san a'n'nai' smears on gum                       § 32.   Temporal suffixes.
   Not all verbs have a definite temporal form. The use of absolute
or tenseless verb forms is discussed in § 51, 2. Besides the temporal
suffixes here discussed, two of the enclitic elements express temporal
relations (§ 19, 1).
   (1) -y'i- present tense. The great majority of verbs express a
specific reference to present time by means of this suffix. Examples
are:

pu'tcu'tcuywa-       to know            pu'tcu'tcuywa'yiqwA       knows it
   (2) -q a- present and past tense. A number of verbs, some of
them of extremely common occurrence, are used not with -y'i-, but
with -q a-, which refers indifferently to present or past time. Perhaps
the -q a- forms are best considered as the equivalents of tenseless
absolutes in other verbs. These verbs are αϊ- ΤΟ SAY, ania- ΤΟ SAY
WHAT?, verbs of doing in -wi- (§ 26, 2, b; § 43, 3), and diminutive
verbs in -(n)tsi- (§ 35, 2). Examples are:
      to sav                            'ani'cen 'a'ik-^A      what-I said?;
                                            ta'mpiniay     a'ik-A   tired-of-

preterital element, its main point of difference from enclitic -(n)tca-
and -ywa- (§ 19, 1) being its emphasis on the idea of completion.

"                          § 47. Noun and verb stem.
  All Paiute stems end in a vowel or diphthong. A peculiarity of the
great majority of noun and verb stems is that they are primarily
disyllabic, e. g. qan iHOUSE;   fivwi-a EARTH; αΙ α-° SAND; ραγ(«){-"" τ ο
GO; qari-"" ΤΟ SIT; paq a-° ΤΟ KILL. The typical monosyllabic stem (or
radical) of so many languages is conspicuous by its comparative
infrequency; moreover, practically all monosyllabic stems have two
moras, e. g. qa -' ΤΟ SING, pai-"" ΤΟ CALL to -"" BLACK, O - S ARROW, pen-""
BLOOD. If expressed in terms of moras, the typical Paiute stem
would probably be found to have two moras, i. e. to consist of a
monosyllable with a long vowel or diphthong, or, far more frequently,
of two short-voweled syllables. However, disyllabic stems of three
moras (e. g. tu-γυ•- ΤΟ CACHE, Una - BOTTOM) are not at all rare.
Trisyllabic stems, of three or more moras (e. g. as ia - SURFACE,
tayoq wi- ΤΟ RUN), are also fairly common; stems of four or more
                Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean      Language
            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                      213syllables are rare (e. g. ttvwitsiya- ΤΟ OBEY). Were extended com-
parative Uto-Aztekan material available, it would no doubt be
possible to show that many of these trisyllabic and tetrasyllable
stems are capable of analysis. The two-moraed stem ending in a
vowel, of both monosyllabic and disyllabic structure, is clearly the
characteristic type of stem for all Uto-Aztekan languages.
   Noun and verb stems are kept clearly distinct, the use of the same
stem now as noun, now as verb, being exceedingly uncommon. An
example is quq wa- WOOD, also ΤΟ GATHER WOOD (cf. English BERRY
and ΤΟ BERRY); note also ni(y)a- (two-moraed) ΤΟ CALL BY NAME,
but ni{y)a•- (three-moraed) NAME (it is quite possible, however, that
niya- really consists of niya- + possessive -α-, § 24, 2, a so t h a t niya-
would be another example of a stem capable of being used either as
noun or verb).
   From a strictly formal standpoint, noun and verb are, as we have
seen, carefully distinguished, there being very few grammatical
elements which are appended to both types of stem (e. g. diminutive
-tsi-, § 35; plural -q a-, § 31, 1, c and § 48, 2). However, there is a
slight tendency for verbs to be nominalized, without nominalizing
suffix, by means of nominal postpositions, but forms of this sort are
far from common (e. g. p'ivwa wim'jf aip a ntux wA WHICH-IN STAND-
PERFECTIVE-TO, TO WHERE ( H E ) HAD STOOD) ; see § 55,2. The clearest
syntactic indication of a feeling for nominal form is the presence of
article-pronouns (§42).","[230, 231]"

   The Paiute relative pronoun, pi-, can be used only with post-
positions; e. g. pima- WITH WHICH, pu'urai- WHERETO, WHITHER,
pivwa- IN WHICH, WHERE. The equivalent of our own subjective and
objective relative clauses is afforded by participles and verbal nouns
in -na- (§ 25, 3). Properly speaking, pi- is a noun, as is shown by
the fact that it is frequently followed by an inanimate article-pronoun.
The verb following the relative is generally in the form of a verbal
noun in -n a-, less frequently in the form of a participle in -p i- (§
25, 5, b), rarely a non-participial absolute; hence the logical subject
of a relative clause is always objective (i. e. possessive) in form. A
sentence like THIS IS THE STICK THAT I HIT HIM WITH is rendered by
THIS IS THE STICK WITH WHICH (IS) MY HITTING (OR HAVING HIT) HIM.
Examples of relative clauses are;
itci'a q-A n'fni p'ivwa' qari'n ani this (inan. obj.)-it (vis.) me which-in
   sitting-my, this is where I stay
pima'(u)φϊ na'uq wirjqui u'ava nA which-with-own            fight-future-verbal

treated as a noun, as shown by the possessive -ΐ'(ϊ)- preceding it.","[228, 229]"
"                           § 24.   Noun suffixes.
  (1)   A B S O L U T I V E OR CLASSIFYING ELEMENTS. Many nouns end in
a suffix that either suggests classification of the noun under a general
category or that has little assignable significance except to render the
noun absolute. Some of these elements disappear in composition
or when the noun is used with a possessive pronominal enclitic, others
may or may not. Some nouns appear with or without an absolutive
suffix, e. g. rii'yw'L and riiywints· PERSON.
   (a) -vi-n, -p i-"", -mpi-n absolutive suffix implying indefiniteness
or non-specification of possessor. These elements, which immediately
follow the stem, are used with nouns expressing objects, persons, or
relations that can hardly be thought of except in connection with
other objects or persons, e. g. terms of relationship, body-part nouns,
and substantivized local concepts (e. g. BOTTOM, SURFACE). They
may be rendered by SOMEBODY'S, OF SOMETHING or, preferably, left
untranslated. They always disappear with pronominal enclitics and
in composition.
   Examples of -vi-"" are:
moa'-m father-my                        7ηοα'φι (somebody's) father
paa'-ni    aunt-my                      paa'φι      (somebody's) aunt

the absolutive suffix when its possessor (person or object) is referred
to or implied elsewhere in the sentence, e. g. NJ'NI a'x o OF-ME TONGUE

114                                  SAPIR   A few personal nouns are derived by combining (-1n-n,)-p-i-""
(,-mpi-n) with -tsc- (see below), e. g.:
'iija""piU· baby: ϊηα·""αηι my baby
mi'pits·      evil spirit, ghost, irii'pintupi   ghost-making-game (for
    final -p i, see § 25, 5, a)
   Less frequently this suffix is also combined with -mp'C- (see e below),
e. g.:
cvi'vwimpi squaw-bush, ordinarily σίί'φϊ (stem cvi-"", e. g. ciiru- to
   make a basket out of squaw-bush twigs)
   (c) -mpi-3 BERBY. This classificatory suffix can hardly be identified
with -mpi- of (a) or (b) above, as it occurs in consistently nasalized
form after all stems (e. g. wa'a'mpi CEDAR-BERRY < wa'a-0 CEDAR)
and has spirantizing, not nasalizing, power. Examples are:
tiywa'mpi     service-berry, ίίψΰατηριφϊ    service-berry bush (for -vt-
   see e below)
wa'a'mpi cedar-berry (cf. wa'a'p-ϊ cedar tree)

   (d) -vi-*, -p 'i-*, -mp'C-* absolutive suffix, very similar, as regards
range of usage, to -vi-n, -p i-"", -mpi-"" (b above). I t is used in certain
body-part nouns, in nouns denoting movable objects, objects in mass
(e. g. SAND, MUD), and topographical features, and in nouns denoting
HIDE, BLANKET.       I t is partly movable, partly fixed. When appropri-
ate, this suffix may be followed, though infrequently, by           (see a
above).
   Examples of -vi-* are:

    I t is not a t all improbable t h a t all examples of -vi-"", -ρϊ-', -mp'i-'
t h a t indicate HIDE, BLANKET, CLOTHING are only apparently pro-
vided with absolutive -ρϊ-' and t h a t they are really compound nouns
whose second element, -ρϊ-', is shortened (see § 11) from pTi-',
ρϊ-' HIDE (see above; -vi-' of ρΰ'φϊ HIDE itself, however, is clearly
absolutive).
    Apparently distinct from absolutive -vi-', though not easy to keep
apart from it, is -νϊ- (-ρ ϊ- and -mp'i- are not found alternating with it)
suffixed to nouns used in some specialized or metaphorical sense.
These nouns are generally compounds. When possessive enclitics
are added, possessive -a- (see 2, a below) is generally suffixed to
-vi-. Examples are:

tory -tsi-n or diminutive -ISL- (§ 35), e. g. a'ip ATS• B O Y , plur. -UITJW'L.
  A number of inanimate nouns also end in -tsi- (apparently not
diminutive -tsi-), e. g.:wii'ts• knife: wiirfwinapi knife-point, wi 'p u'cayai-         to look for a
  knife
mara'ts• metate: ma'RA me täte
mo'a'ts- stone mealer  Such nouns as these corroborate Shoshonean comparative evidence,
which shows that *-ti, *-ta (S. Californian -t, -I; S. Paiute -tsi-) was
originally used, like its Nahuatl cognate -tl(i), for all types of nouns.
In Paiute, however, this element tended largely to become restricted
to animate (including particularly personal) nouns.
  Examples of -ntsi- are:

This suffix is compounded of -vi-', -p'i-, -τηρϊ-' (see d above) and
animate -f»i-n (see f above). I t is also quite possible that some of
our examples contain diminutive -tsi- (cf. pa-'vits• SPRING under d).
Examples of -vitsi-n are:

   (2) E L E M E N T S DEFINING POSSESSION. Here are grouped a number
of suffixes that appear chiefly with possessive pronominal enclitics and
which, on the whole, define the nature of the possessive relation.
It is not always easy, as a matter of fact, to see exactly what increment
of significance they bring.
   (a) -a- seems to be used to indicate possession that is alienable,
particularly, it would seem, of such objects as are not normally
thought of as being possessed. It is generally preceded by -ρϊ-*
(see 1, d and e). Examples are:
fivwi'piariimi     our (excl.) country {-riimi our); RVwL ρ 'Laiariimi our
   country (obj.) (-ία- objective, § 49, 1).
ρα·'""νϊαηι spring that I own
a'oTjqovianl my dried-up woods
üyqa'nivia(i)ya'i)WA his cave (obj.) owned as house (-ya- objective);
   fiijqa'nLviatsia^i  his own little cave (obj.) (-tsi- diminutive; -a-
   objective; -φϊ, § 40, 4)
  Possessive -a- may also be used with causative -tui- (§ 29, 12)
to form verbs indicating ΤΟ CAUSE TO HAVE SO AND SO, e. g.:
tumpwi' Apiiplya' caused (it) to have stones
qan-L Atuip lya   caused (it) to have houses
nayqa'Atuip 'iya caused (it) to have branches
   For possessive -a- combining with verbalizing -kai- το HAVE into
-ayai- (participle -ayaiifi-), see § 26, 1, b; for possessive -a- after
past passive participial -ρ ϊ-, see 3, b below.
   (b) -rjwa-, -t)'wa-. These elements are used very much like -α-,
occurring both before possessive pronominal enclitics and verbalizing
-kai- το HAVE, not, however, before causative -tui-.    They do not
seem to be used after elassificatory -pi- (1, d and e), but may be
directly appended to noun stems. Examples of -ψνα- are:
pai'ywani  my blood (absolute pai'p r, in possessive forms of this
  noun -ywa- is always used)

from -rjwa-) are:tümp'°i'y'wa i)A his rock
ma'xarir'iijwa(i)yayA    his clump of trees (obj.)
qa-'n(uinüTj'wa yA sing-become (§ 26, 1, g)-present ptc. (§ 25, 6, a)-
  possessive-his, song belonging to him   Both -ywa- and -rfwa- are used particularly to indicate possession
of one of a group by the group (e. g. OUR LEADER = THAT ONE OF US
WHO is LEADER). This includes adjectival participles indicating
selection (e. g. THE GOOD ONE of several). Examples are:nia 'vuj'waraywA our chief; qani'ayanfiA nia 'viij'wA house-possessive-
   having-obj. chief-possessive, village's chief
ampa'xarirj'wa m i talker- possessive-their, their talker; qan i ayanti

fWi'tc at vr)wa{i)'yaq wA very good-present ptc.-obj.-their (inan.),
   a very good one of them (inan.)   (c) - a- is used to indicate possession, chiefly of body-parts, t h a t
is inherent without being strictly inalienable. In other words, it
is suffixed to nouns indicating objects (or persons) t h a t do often
occur disconnected in experience (e. g. SALIVA, BONE, SKIN) but are
thought of as indissolubly connected. Examples are:

    (obj.)  (d) -in'{n)i-' (-'in i-') OWNED. This element is always employed

as contrasted with mere possession in the grammatical sense. Ex-
amples are:

              SOUTHERN P A I U T E , A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                           123   (3) T E N S E ELEMENTS. Tense can be expressed in nouns provided
they are first verbalized. This is generally done by suffixing -Icai- ΤΟ BE
(§ 26, 1, a) and then turning the denominative verb into a participle.
Thus, the future form of qava-' HORSE is qava 'xaiva nti HORSE-BE-
FUTURE-PARTICIPLE, A HORSE ΤΟ BE; similarly, qam 'i'xawätci JACK-
RABBIT-BE-USITATIVE-PARTICIPLE, ALWAYS A JACKRABBIT.             Here we
shall specifically list only two compound suffixes relating to past
time, because of their rather characteristic usage.   (a) -yaip'i-,      -qaip-ϊ-,        -ijqaip· Ϊ-   HAVING     BEEN,   PAST,   FORMER;
compounded of -Icai- ΤΟ BE and past participial -pi-                    (see § 25, 5, a).
Examples are:
ini'ayaipini      my dead relation < ini'a ni my relative
muru""ιχαίρ i cast-away blanket
o'tca'(vi)yaip ϊ formerly used water-jar (o't-CA)
qa'yaaitlaxaipia'aywA      rat-hunt-place-be-past partic.-obj.-his, place
   (obj.) where he used to h u n t rats
tma'uykaipi      punch-er-be-past partic., one who used to be a puncher
   (b) -p i- PAST, FORMER. This is the past participial -p i- (see § 25,
5, a), only rarely used with noun stems, e. g.:
qanip'i     abandoned house, village site, old camping place
  I t is sometimes found combined with possessive -a- (2, a) as                    -ρϊα-,
e. g.:
a'i<t>Api(y)anyivw'ini            youth-past-possessive- friend-my, my former
   youthful friend
  This -ρ ϊα- occurs also combined with other elements in verbal
forms (see -p'ia-yai-tua-, § 32, 8; -p 'ia-yi-, § 32, 7)                              § 25. Nominalizing          suffixes.
   These are formed chiefly from verb and adjective-verb stems. The
verbal noun in -n a- and the various participles are in very frequent,
in part idiomatic, use.
  ( 1 ) AGENTIVE -vi-"",           -mpi-n.    Examples of agentive-Π'-"" are:

                            Editorial Notes   1. It is unlikely that all these names refer to bands in the political
sense. Others have recorded similar forms (see Kelly and Fowler 1986:
394-396).
   2. See M a p 1 for locations of these geographic designations.
   3. Sapir meant that Paiutes were no longer living there in 1910.
   4. We are unable to identify this place with certainty, but from the
evidence presented it may be Shem, the principal settlement on the
Shivwits Reservation.
   5. Sapir (1931k: 685) identifies this ""creek"" as the San Juan River
(see also Place Names, below). However, Southern Paiutes then were
and now are living along Hamblin Wash on the Navajo Reservation
northwest of Tuba City and near the San Juan River in Piute Canyon
northeast of Navajo Mountain. Kelly (1964) combined all of the
Southern Paiute populations south of the Colorado and San Juan rivers
into her ""San Juan Band."" Bunte and Franklin (1987) discuss the
ethnohistory of the group in depth.
   6. See Powell and Ingalls (1874, reprinted in Fowler and Fowler 1971:
98 — 104). Sapir seemingly requested clarification of the term recorded
by Powell as referring to Southern Paiute people ""east of the Colorado
River"" (Fowler and Fowler 1971: 104).
   7. Moapa Reservation, Nevada.
   8. Charleston Peak in the Spring Range, near Las Vegas, Nevada.
   9. Sapir added these two names to his list from the United States
Census, 1910. Kelly (1964: 31—36) has a similar list of neighboring
tribes.
   10. Probably Tony Tillohash's folk etymology.
   11. Sapir's notes originally identified the referents of this term as the
Mojave, another Yuman-speaking group. He bracketed that and added
""Walapai,"" but notes (1931k: 593 — 594) that the translation is probably
a folk etymology.
   12. Kelly (1964: 36) notes that ""Aiats"" is the name by which the
Mojave are known to the Shivwits and Moapa Paiutes. The Havasupai
were sometimes referred to as Coconino or Cosino (Kelly 1964: 35 — 36).
   13. ""Gentiles"" in local usage refers to non-Mormons.
   14. Cliff dwellings in Kanab Canyon were occupied prehistorically
by the Anasazi, ancestors of the Hopi. The Hopi refer to these ancestors
904                      X Soulhern   Paiute   and   Ute
as Hisätsinom. There are extensive panels of pictographs in Snake Gulch,
a tributary of Kanab Canyon.
   15. George served as a primary consultant to Kelly, but indicated
that he had been appointed chief by the Whites rather than in the old
way (Kelly 1964: 29).
   16. North of Kanab. In ascending order, the formations are locally
referred to as the Red (or Vermillion) Cliffs, White Cliffs, and Pink
Cliffs.
   17. See Kelly (1964) for location of some of these, as well as other
springs. The numbers given here may originally have been on maps now
lost, as Sapir refers in this list to topographic maps available in 1910.
   18. Reference to a topographic map available to Sapir in 1910. He
also refers to ""Kanab Sheet,"" ""Kaibab Sheet,"" and ""St. George Sheet,""
below.
   19. Now called Colorado City.
   20. Cane Beds, a place on the Arizona Strip.
   21. Now a uranium mine on the Arizona Strip south of the Kaibab
Paiute Reservation.
   22. Apparently New Mexico locust, Robinia neomexicana.
   23. Sapir gave no Paiute term for this. Kelly (1964: 8) gives ""Tinka-
nivac,"" or 'cave water', the same as Sapir's Number 17.
   24. Kelly (1964: 48), based on additional interviews on communal
hunting, suggests a point of clarification on this procedure: individuals
were stationed at divides or hollows in ridges where deer were likely to
go when pursued by the other hunters moving through the brush and
trees.
   25. Kelly's (1964: 50) data confirm Kaibab hunting of mountain sheep
in the Zion district, which includes Rockville and Orderville, but others
told her they were also taken on the rim of Grand Canyon.
   26. Kelly (1964: 48) and Stewart (1942: 240) confirm the lack of deer
fences and other enclosures for large game hunting. Stewart's (1942:
248) Kaibab consultants also denied the use of animal disguises, al-
though individuals from other Southern Paiute areas used them.
   27. Although a weapon used by some Ute groups, the thrusting spear
was not reported as used by Southern Paiutes interviewed by Stewart
(1942: 269).
   28. But see Sapir's earlier statement on distribution under ""Communal
Hunting.""
   29. Kelly (1964: 51) illustrates a curved rabbit stick attributed to a
model made by Tony Tillohash for Sapir. She also states that those she
                              Editorial   Notes                      905interviewed felt that the rabbit stick was ""recent,"" having been intro-
duced at the same time as the horse. Stewart's (1942: 336) data tend to
confirm this, with his consultant suggesting a Hopi source. Underhill
(1953: 113) illustrates four versions of the Hopi rabbit stick.
   30. A communal hunt with nets is confirmed by Kelly (1964: 50 — 51)
and Stewart (1942: 242), and is common in the Great Basin region.
   31. The desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida) would be near St. George.
It and the bushy-tailed woodrat (N. cinerea) occurred in the Kaibab
district. Kelly (1964: 52) was told by the Kaibab that both types were
taken.
   32. The plants listed here and under ""Medicinal Plants"" and ""Mis-
cellaneous Plants"" are identified in Table 2.
   33. To the west, the term arj w ibi is more commonly used for corn,
thus suggesting possibly two points of origin and diffusion for the corn
complex (Fowler and Fowler 1981).
   34. Probably Amaranthus blitoides, but tuupuibi was not ordinarily
cultivated. See Note 38 below.
   35. Wild sunflower is Helianthus annuus var. macrocarpus. Kelly (1964:
39) was told that the term for cultivated sunflower did not mean Hopi
sunflower, which seems unlikely.
   36. This technique differs from that of ditching irrigated garden plots
as described for the Southern Paiute to the west (St. George, Shivwits,
Moapa) by Kelly (1932 — 33) and seems closer to the planting techniques
of the Hopi.
   37. This is a reference to the piki of the Hopi, a paper-thin bread
baked on a griddle and rolled.
   38. Sapir apparently corrects the data by noting that töpu cl is not
cultivated, but the confusion continues. See Note 39, below.
   39. Sapir may be in error here, as the plant he describes, with both
a cultivated or white-seeded variety (Amaranthus hypochondriacus; A.
albus) and a wild or black-seeded variety (A. retroflexus, A. palmeri)
is called kumuti.
   40. These are more properly cicadas (Okanogoides spp.). Kelly (1964:
54) has additional data on insect collection.
   41. Sag w aadi is the chuckwalla (Sauromalus obesus), a common food
species in the hot desert areas of the Great Basin and southern Califor-
nia.
   42. Sapir is correct here in inferring the use of pottery for cooking
by the Kaibab. Kelly (1964: 77 — 78) adds more notes on its manufacture,
906                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
and it has been found in limited quantities archeologically in Kaibab
territory (Euler 1964: 379).
   43. Kelly (1964: 52) was told that the prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) did
not occur in Kaibab habitats. Tillohash may be referring to another
Southern Paiute area, or he may be speaking of a species of ground
squirrel (Spermophilus spp.).
   44. See ""Basketry.""
   45. Eagle aeries were private property, ordinarily owned by men
(Kelly 1964: 92). Boys often were lowered into the nests, as stated, but
probably under the direction of men rather than on their own.
   46. Although Stewart (1942: 243) confirms eagle capture from a
domed brush house, he says nothing about the requirement that war-
bonnet feathers be from live eagles. Given that eagles were kept alive
for taking feathers, this may be inferred, however.
   47. Kelly's (1964: 55) notes seem to confirm all of Tillohash's state-
ments on dogs.
   48. The size description seems to fit the Black-necked Stilt (Himan-
topus mexicanus); the coloration (""like a mocking bird""), the Wilson's
Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor).
   49. The plants suggested are: New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexi-
cana); serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia, A. utahensis)', black willow
(Salix gooddingii) or narrow-leaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia);
Osage orange (Maclura pomifera; introduced); and Gambel's oak (Quer-
cus gambelii).
   50. Kelly (1964: 73) illustrates the simple bow type and confirms this
statement. Recurved bows are visible in J. K. Hillers's photographs
from 1871, but principally for the Moapa-Las Vegas areas (Euler 1966:
Figures 45, 46; Fowler and Matley 1979: Figure 49e).
   51. Most shaft wrenches collected by J. W. Powell in the 1870s from
the southern Utah Southern Paiute, including the Kaibab, and now on
deposit in the United States National Museum of Natural History,
Smithsonian Institution, are of mountain sheep rather than antelope
horn.
   52. See Kelly (1964: Figure 10c) for an illustration of an arrow
supposedly drawn for Sapir by Tillohash.
   53. A common plant used for this was scouring rush (Equisetum spp.)
— unless a sandstone smoother is meant (see above).
   54. Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis).
   55. Fletching and shaft decoration on specimens collected by J. W.
Powell in the 1870s are treated in Fowler and Matley (1979: 150-151).
                              Editorial   Notes                        907   56. Incised lines are noted on the shafts collected by J. W. Powell and
deposited in the Smithsonian Institution (Fowler and Matley 1979: 64).
   57. Kelly (1964: 76) lists ringtail, fox, coyote, lion or fawn skin for
quivers in addition to wildcat or bobcat. Three southern Utah Southern
Paiute quivers from the J. W. Powell collection are illustrated by Fowler
and Matley (1979: 155).
   58. Kelly (1964: 76 — 77) describes both the slow match and the fire
hearth and drill.
   59. The shape was said to be tubular for the Kaibab (Stewart 1942:
293). A slightly curving but basically tubular pipe of Kaibab manufac-
ture was collected by J. W. Powell (Fowler and Matley 1979: 165).
   60. Nicotiana attenuata.
   61. J. W. Powell collected one ""tan soapstone"" pipe among the
Kaibab, although most of the others he collected are green (Fowler and
Matley 1979: 73).
   62. See Kelly (1964: 78ff.) and Fowler and Matley (1979) for technical
descriptions and illustrations of common Southern Paiute baskets.
   63. I.e., coiled. Ciuv wl 'squawbush' is skunk bush (Rhus aromatica
var. trilobata).
   64. Both the close coiled and the open twined burden baskets are
described here. Both types are documented in the literature (Kelly 1964:
79, 84). A close twined conical seed collecting basket was also made
and called by the same term.
   65. Coiled basket caps are known from Moapa but, according to
Kelly (1964: 83), are not reported from the Kaibab.
   66. Undoubtedly devil's claw (Proboscidea parviflora), the split fruits
of which are used in basketry.
   67. J. W. Powell collected baskets from this area in 1872 with over-
painting used to enhance woven designs.
   68. This should read ""stripped out by hand,"" as no implement was
used.
   69. Kelly (1964: 84) discusses cradle styles and also illustrates typical
examples collected.
   70. Milkweed is Asclepias sp., probably A. fascicularis, Mexican
milkweed. Dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum) was also used by the
Kaibab (Kelly 1964: 81).
   71. Kelly (1964: 71) illustrates the handle for this type of blade, based
on a sketch made by Sapir.
   72. Kelly (1964: 71) suggests that in the first application, brains are
put on both sides; in the second, usually on the hair side only.

   73. In a sentence above, Sapir suggests that there are three applica-
tions. Kelly (1964: 71) indicates two.
   74. Plants are identified as follows: wa c ap'°, common juniper (Juni-
perus communis) and Utah juniper (J. utahensis); s-ö'vip'° Fremont
cottonwood (Populus fremontii); qwiyav0, Gambel oak (Quercus gam-
belii); wifiv"", milkweed (Asclepias sp., probably A. fascicular is, Mexican
milkweed, but also possibly dogbane, Apocynum cannabinum); qanav°,
willow (Salix sp.); paywi'av 0 , Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrumJ;

nusponderosa)·, oxömp'°, white fir (Abies concolorJ; tsicAmpiv°, Woods
rose (Rosa woodsii).
   75. I.e., rose hip.
   76. See ""Arrows"" for the suggestion that currant arrows also need to
be greased.
   77. The buckskin clothing here described may be of relatively late
introduction to the Southern Paiute, i.e., 1860s. Kelly (1964: 5 9 - 6 5 )
suggests that the Plains styles may have replaced the more common
skirts or dresses of bark after the introduction of guns and horses.
   78. Most of the shirts photographed by J. K. Hillers in the 1870s for
the Powell expedition reach mid-thigh. However, some of these may be
of Ute manufacture, and in use only for the photographic sessions
(Fowler and Matley 1979: 30).
   79. map'"" is cliff-rose (Purshia mexicana).
   80. Various other caps are pictured in the Hillers photographs from
other Southern Paiute areas (Fowler and Matley 1979). Some are in the
J. W. Powell collection in the Smithsonian Institution.
   81. Women's moccasins often have high tops, reaching to mid- or
upper calf, and thus serving as leg protectors (Fowler and Matley 1979:
130).
   82. Presumably ""overcast""; however, this is rarely observed on moc-
casins collected in the area (Fowler and Matley 1979).
   83. Kelly (1964: 64) also illustrates a moccasin with separate tongue,
although those in the Powell collection from the area rarely have such
(Fowler and Matley 1979: 3Iff.).
   84. This paragraph appeared elsewhere in the manuscript, but it
reinforces several points. Stewart (1942) also notes lack of moccasin
decoration.
   85. This description is less than clear, as there is no indication of how
the twisting is accomplished (e.g., on the thigh, with the hands, etc.). If
both of the strips are turned in the same direction, the result would be
                              Editorial   Notes                      909one long strip with the same direction of twist. If not, they would twist
around each other producing a two-ply piece, which seems not to be
intended.
   86. This number seems unusually low. The figure of 15, given above,
seems closer.
   87. Braided hair dressing for men was also claimed by Kelly's (1964:
65) Kaibab consultants, although few braids are to be seen in Hillers's
photographs from the 1870s. This style may have come from the Ute
in the late nineteenth century.
   88. The whereabouts of the various ""models"" made by Tillohash is
unknown. They were apparently not accessioned at the University
Museum, University of Pennsylvania (Alessandro Pezzati, Archivist,
personal communication, January 1989).
   89. This practice was common among the Ute (Stewart 1942: 279).
   90. The feather bonnets shown in the Hillers photographs are prob-
ably an affectation for photographic purposes (Fowler and Matley 1979:
138).
   91. nänt' is Agave utahensis. The leaf fibers were used as a comb.
   92. The statement implies that the beads were contained in the earlobe
and not suspended from a string.
   93. The Powell collection from the Kaibab includes bird-bone and
claw necklaces as well as one made of Olivella shells.
   94. This house is larger than those seen in the Hillers photographs
(e.g., Fowler and Matley 1979: Figure 57), but houses were generally
built to accommodate the number of family members (Kelly 1964: 56).
   95. Kelly (1964: 58) suggests Ute introduction, sometime between the
1870s and 1900. See also Euler (1966).
   96. See Sapir's Ute notes that follow. Reference is probably to the
tripod or conical house (Stewart 1942: 257).
   97. Kelly's (1964: 59) consultants denied the use of sweat houses,
relating a single event in which such use resulted in a death. Both Ute
and Navajo neighbors used them extensively, however. The sweat house
described suggests the Navajo type (Stewart 1942: 259).
   98. Sapir seems to correct this form to tcäcix y an"" in the section on
""Birth,"" translating naxan"" as 'whore house'.
   99. Kelly (1964: 98) gives additional menstrual observances.
   100. näxan"" is said above to refer to menstrual hut. Sapir (1931k:
576) gives nai-xanl, na.-xanl 'house of prostitution' from stem nai-s 'to
have sexual connection, to mate'.
910                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
   101. Sapir (1930e: 375) recorded from Tillohash the tale of how
Coyote set birth customs.
   102. According to Stewart (1942: 306), the cord is placed in a special
skin pouch and attached to the child's cradle. It is later disposed of in
a way appropriate to the child's sex so that the child will benefit later
in life.
   103. Stewart's (1942: 305) data seem to confirm this for the Kaibab,
but not all Southern Paiute.
   104. Possibly the Rock Wren (Salpinctes obsoletus).
   105. Kelly (1964: 101) was told that cremation was reserved for
""mean"" people.
   106. Both lists show some terminological inconsistencies with other
published schedules (e.g., Kelly 1964). Because Tillohash was orphaned
and partly raised by a Mormon family, he may not have been familiar
with the full range of lexical items in this domain.
   107. In the historic period, Southern Paiute people were enslaved by
the Navajo and sold by Ute and Navajo to Mexicans in Santa Fe (Euler
1966).
   108. Sapir (1931k: 685), however, later translates the form as 'Acorn(?)
man's name'.
   109. Sapir is probably checking for a minimal pair here rather than
recording an additional name.
   110. These are all the political data Sapir recorded in 1910. For a
fuller account see Kelly (1964: 26 — 30), and for an ethnohistorical
reconstruction of bands and ""chiefs"" see Euler (1966: 99 — 104).
   111. Kelly (1964: 133 — 142) presents data on religion, some of which
she says ""comes from Sapir's notes."" Some are not found in the 1910
ethnographic notes which we have and could be in other Sapir notes of
which we are unaware; however, see the introduction for comments on
the Sapir notes available to Kelly. There is nothing here that is contra-
dicted by Kelly, and Sapir's notes are much fuller than Kelly's section
on Kaibab religion. See also Kelly (1939).
   112. Compare with Kelly (1964: 140-141).
   113. Kelly (1939: 151) remarked that a shaman was ""never a young
woman ... in a list of twenty shamans, only two were women.""
   114. In 1776, when the first party of Europeans to see Paiutes were
camped near the Paria River, an elderly Paiute shaman attempted to
cure one of the ill Spaniards by singing over him at night. In 1854, a
Mormon missionary wrote about Paiute shamans curing by sucking on
the patient's body (Euler 1966: 111).
                                       Editorial   Notes                911   115. The motif of a world underground where everything is opposite
to this world is known generally among the Southern Paiute and Great
Basin peoples.
   116. Kelly (1939: 153) reported three Kaibab shamans who specialized
in curing rattlesnake bites. Her belief that the plant used was of the
g e n u s Ligusticum   is c o r r e c t ; it is Ligusticum   porteri.
   117. A Hopi Indian.
   118. This is a much more complete account of the mourning ceremony
than that given by Kelly (1964) and by Sapir (1912c).
   119. This is true also of the mourning songs sung by Havasupai and
Walapai.
   120. Probably among the Mojave or other lower Colorado River
Yumans.
   121. This figure is undoubtedly exaggerated; Kaibab Paiutes never
had that many horses to sacrifice.
   122. Shivwits Paiute.
   123. Kelly (1964: 85) illustrates such a rattle made by Tillohash for
Sapir in 1910.
   124. Usually referred to as Captain Pete.
   125. In Arizona east of the present Kaibab Paiute Reservation.
   126. Skutumpah Ranch is near the head of Johnson Canyon northeast
of Kanab.
   127. The meaning of this sentence is obscure. It may mean that the
mountain sheep group was formed of others who were neither ""coyotes""
nor ""birds""; or it may mean that there were other unaffiliated groups
of singers present.
   128. There are no Southern Paiute drums among the ethnographic
specimens collected by Powell in the 1870s (Fowler and Matley 1979:
72). Kelly (1964: 85) lists as musical instruments only the Cry Dance
rattle and the Bear Dance rasp, both late arrivals.
   129. Cane Beds, Arizona, west of the Kaibab Paiute Reservation.
   130. We are unable to identify this place with certainty, but it may
be Shem, the population and agency center on the Shivwits Reservation.
Lacking a mid front vowel, Southern Paiute speakers often substitute
[a] in their English. Similarly [s ] does not occur initially and may be
reflected as [s]. Sapir was not familiar with Utah place names, as the
manuscript suggests.
   131. Little is known about Kaibab Paiute participation in the 1890
Ghost Dance movement. Kelly (1964: 106 — 107) relied upon Sapir's
912                     X Southern   Paiute and Ute
notes for her data. Sapir's data are minimal, since Tillohash apparently
had only seen or heard about it as a small child.
   132. The central pole was part of the Northern Paiute version of this
dance, from which all others were adopted (Jorgensen 1986). The use
of a cane as a substitute may be uniquely Southern Paiute, perhaps
representing the canes a number of Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi
men commonly carried as a mark of status (see for example, Laird
1976).
   133. Kelly's (1964: 120-121) statements about mythology are mostly
from Sapir's notes.
   134. Sapir (1930e: 4 0 8 - 4 1 0 ) records this tale.
   135. See Liljeblad (1986) for discussion of this class of spirits.
   136. Sapir (1930e: 464 — 471) records this tale. The bird's name is
literally 'person carrier', but it is described as being a bird.
   137. The string around the vagina is a common mythic theme in
southern California.
   138. For more on the quality of voices of animal actors see Sapir
(1910d).
   139. Again, this mythic theme is well known in the region.
   140. Powell records the same theme (Fowler and Fowler 1971).
   141. Kelly (1964: 134-135) gives additional data.
   142. Kelly (1964: 136) gives a table correlating these data on month
names with those she received in 1933.
   143. These four are the names of song cycles for the Cry or Mourning
Ceremony.
   144. Kelly (1964: 107ff.) discusses a number of details on the Bear
Dance and its introduction to the Kaibab from the Ute. She uses Sapir's
account as background.
   145. Above, Sapir describes the position of the hands as not on the
shoulders but behind the waist. Kelly (1964:109) also notes discrepancies
in hand positions.
   146. By 1915, Lowie (1924: 299) was able to witness a Bear Dance
involving Shivwits people and locals at Moapa. He was told that the
dance had been adopted three or four years before.
   147. Hillers photographed Paiute round dances near Kanab, Utah
about 1872 (Euler 1966: Appendix I, page 5, and Figure 24; Steward
1939, Plates 7 and 8).
   148. Kelly's (1964: 98) data confirm lack of a dance for girls at
puberty.
                              Editorial   Notes                       913   149. The implication is that the hiding side does sing. Kelly (1964:
114) was told that both sides sang at once. Culin (1907: 312) states that
the hiding team chants first, followed by the guessing team.
   150. In each pair of bones, one is marked in the center, usually with
a wrapping of buckskin or pitch-covered twine (Fowler and Matley
1979: 159). The position of the unmarked bones is guessed as indicated
in the statement below.
   151. I.e., the hiding team.
   152. Kelly (1964: 114) suggests that this statement may refer to the
version played with two bones —one held by each of two players.
Normally a bone would be in each hand in the four-bone version.
   153. Kelly (1964: 113) says seven counters were preferred. Stewart
(1942: 286) indicates that there were ten per side.
   154. Notes on the stick dice game were recorded by Sapir on three
separate occasions and contain two corrections. They are left as recorded
rather than rewritten to reflect the corrections, to illustrate that Sapir
apparently returned to some topics on occasion to cross-check infor-
mation. Kelly (1964: 114) illustrates stick dice apparently made for Sapir
by Tillohash.
   155. This probably refers to the scoring procedure for the cup and
ball game, described below.
   156. We are uncertain as to which game Sapir refers to here. It may
be the four stick game, which Culin (1907: 334) records for the Southern
Paiute, based on notes and specimens collected by J. W. Powell. It was
played by men only.
   157. Although not the same scoring method, Sapir refers to the use
of the same principle in his account of the dice game.
   158. The term ""cedar"" is popularly used in this region for juniper
{Juniperus spp.).
   159. Kelly (1964) does not mention this. Stewart (1942: 285) lists its
occurrence only among the San Juan Southern Paiute.
   160. See ""Rabbit Hunting."" This game, described to C. Fowler in the
1960s, was said often to result in injuries to horses and riders.
   161. Stewart (1942: 290) also notes the seeming absence among the
Southern Paiute of string figures.
   162. Stewart (1942: 290) lists foot races as present among the Kaibab
and does not note them as ""recent.""
   163. Stewart (1942: 290) lists stilts as ""recent"" among the Kaibab but
aboriginal among his other Southern Paiute groups.
914                      X Southern Paiute and Ute
   164. Although identified by Sapir as huckleberry, this is undoubtedly
the referent for blue elderberry (Sambucus caerulea).
   165. See section on ""Arrow Shoots"" under ""Games of Skill"" for a
similar adult game.
   166. Kelly (1964: 119) illustrates a bull-roarer, apparently made for
Sapir by Tillohash.
   167. These few notes were scattered throughout Sapir's field notebook.
They are grouped here as a miscellaneous category.
   168. Kelly (1964: 133) repeats this and gives but little information on
""greetings.""
   169. Sapir notes here ""Cree on authority of Skinner-Speck."" Skinner
is Alanson B. Skinner, and Speck is Frank G. Speck, both of whom
worked among the Cree.
   170. See Calloway, Janetski, and Stewart (1986: 338-339, 365-366)
for similar group names. Not all given here can be easily traced to those
known most commonly in the literature (Map 2).
   171. This is undoubtedly from ""Weber,"" as in Weber County in north-
central Utah. This particular group, known popularly as ""Weber Utes,""
was Shoshone-speaking, as Sapir correctly notes.
   172. Groups now on the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming.
   173. The Gosiutes speak a dialect of Shoshone. The Paviotso referred
to here are from the western Great Basin and speak a related but
different language than either ""Ute-Paiute"" (Ute) or Shoshone (Miller
1986).
   174. The identity of this group is unknown. Herbert Ariv's entry,
below, may indicate that they are Pueblo.
   175. Stewart (1942: 240) confirms all of these techniques.
   176. See also the account of this activity in the Kaibab notes.
   177. Smith (1974: 49) refers to the making of pemmican by the Utes.
   178. See Hillers's photographs of what may be drying platforms in
Ute camps in the early 1870s (Fowler and Fowler 1971: 52, 54). Smith
(1974: 67 — 68) gives only Sapir's account.
   179. These three foods are: Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), thistle
(Cirsium sp.), and serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia, A. utahensis).
   180. Stewart (1942: 244) was told by his Timpanogots and Pahvant
consultants that coyote was eaten. His Uintah consultants, however,
confirmed all the food taboos given here.
   181. The Utes had been involved in trade with the Mexicans since at
least the early 1700s (Calloway, Janetski, and Stewart 1986).

of her consultants confirmed the use of prickly pear cactus leaves as
temper.
   183. Smith (1974: 89ff.) gives an account of the common Ute basket
types. Her description matches most of the types given here, although
there is some minor terminological confusion.
   184. Smith (1974: 80ff.) gives an account in depth of the tanning
process.
   185. I.e., cottontail. The account that follows of making rabbit-skin
blankets clearly assigns this technology to the Great Basin.
   186. Sapir and J. Alden Mason observed these designs at dances at
Whiterocks, Utah, in 1909. The list is the most extensive account known
of Ute facial decoration.
   187. Smith (1974: 37 — 42) also discusses the details of tepee construc-
tion.
   188. See Hillers's photographs of Ute summer brush houses as repro-
duced in Steward (1939) and Fowler and Fowler (1971).
   189. This very extensive list, with its Shoshone comparisons, probably
from the same consultant, is far more complete than any published
since.
   190. Also known as ""water babies"" elsewhere in the Great Basin
(Liljeblad 1986).
   191. See Jorgensen (1986) for accounts of all these dances. The Bear
Dance is particularly well known for the Ute.
   192. See Vennum (1986). This is apparently a form of the Plains
Grass Dance.

   Consonantal glides are frequent after the high vowels (i, ϊ, ν).
The semivowels y and w act as glides after i and u respectively,
y after ϊ. A weakly articulated y, such as the y- glide always is, is
really a high-back unrounded semivowel, corresponding to ϊ pre-
cisely as w does to u.
        (1)   y. This glide, often represented as y when only weakly
                   GLIDE
articulated, is rather common between a primary ϊ and a following
vowel. Even ϊ·, when resolved to vi (see § 4, 2, b), may develop to
Vi, iyi. Examples are:
ϊα- to plant                                       'Pa'p i planted, corn

three distinct groups of cases.
  (a) Glide, w between vowels. After a primary u (ο) a w, indicated as
™ if weak, often slips in before an immediately following vowel. If
the second vowel is voiceless, the w- glide is unvoiced to tv. Examples
are:
tua- son                                tuwa'tsinl my son

-u(w)it-uywa-  before                   mo'(w)itux    \VA before me
  The use of -w- as glide seems incidentally to serve as criterion of
the difference between a true m diphthong and a dissyllabic u + i.
Thus, with -u(w)i't uywa above contrast causative -(ui- with diph-
thongal ui (rarely, if ever, uwi).
   (b) Rounded labials. Bilabial consonants (j>, ρ, ν, φ, m) are
normally pronounced with unrounded lips. Under certain conditions,
however, they are pronounced with w- position of the lips. This
position may bring about a slight w- glide between the labial and the
following vowel. Several groups of cases are to be noted.
   Initially mw-, sometimes heard exaggerated into ""mw- or even
umw-, is found in demonstrative two-moraed mwa'-, m ^a'-, THAT
(see § 43); possibly this mwa'~ is developed from an older uma'- >
umwa'- (see below). An initial mw- also sometimes develops before
an immediately following ϊ; e. g. mwim'""i- YE.
   A medial -mw- develops regularly after primary ϊ, ϊ. When the
vowel following the -m w - is unvoiced, the    glide is also unvoiced
(""•). Examples are nim""i- WE (exclu.); cimw'ia- ΤΟ LET GO; ti'mwa- ΤΟ
ROAST; ani'ntcim""   i'mi (ARE) DOING T H E S E ( A N I M . ) ; co 'ri""antimw'i

before i, whose timbre contrasts most clearly with that of pw. Ex-

   After ϊ or u, υ is inner-rounded. The result, written vw, is not ν +
   glide but a bilabial ν with inner rounding, a sound acoustically
midway between ν and w. I t is phonetically related to w very much
as y is to y. Before voiceless vowels vw is unvoiced to φw. Examples

   ( 1 ) T Y P E S OF GLOTTAL STOP.     Glottal stops occur very frequently
in Southern Paiute. They are rarely exaggerated in articulation,
however, and are often quite easily missed. The glottal stop may
function as an integral element of a stem (e. g. 'ayu- ΤΟ BE GOOD,
sa'a- ΤΟ BOIL) or grammatical element (e. g. -yw'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO,
-n'ni- continuative); as in itself a grammatical process occurring alone
(e. g. dubitative -', § 19, 2, n; -'- to indicate momentaneous activity,
§ 53,2, a, 3), with such grammatical processes as gemination and redu-
plication (§ 53, 2, b; § 58, 3 and 4) or in connection with certain enclitics,
chiefly pronominal (e. g. -' . . . .-mi- THY, THEE) ; in certain circum-
stances to separate vowels brought together by composition (§ 16, 2);
in final position after perfective -{n)tca- and -ywa- and after indepen-
dent personal pronouns preceding verbs of doing and being (§ 5, 3).
The last group of cases may be considered as inorganic or non-function-
al. The first group of cases may be defined as involving an ""inherent""
glottal stop, the second and third an ""accessory"" glottal stop. The
distinction is important phonetically, inasmuch as a syllable con-
taining an ""inherent"" glottal stop counts for two moras whether its
vowel is short or long, while a short-voweled syllable with ""accessory""
glottal stop counts for only one mora (see § 8, 1, a, end; 2, a, end;
§ 9, end). Outwardly these two types of glottal stop are identical,
but they probably belong to quite distinct historical strata, the
""accessory"" group no doubt representing a later development or
influencing of the word form. Rarely there is evidence to show
that an ""inherent"" glottal stop may arise by way of compensation
for the loss of a vowel. This seems to be true, at least, of na'y'iVA'-

"   (1) SPIRANTIZATION. I t is plausible, from what comparative
evidence is available, that spirantization arose typically when an
element or stem whose initial consonant represents no process of
contraction was affixed to an element or stem whose final vowel

represents its original ending. Original ungeminated stops and -m-
regularlv became spirantized between vowels. There is some com-
parative evidence to show that c (s) and η originally alternated with
-'- and zero respectively as their spirantal developments, but this
is not deducible from Paiute itself and so does not concern us. ""Spir-
antized"" -to-, -ts- can be most convincingly differentiated from
geminated -tc-, -t-s- by the failure of weak moras to lose their voice
before it. The secondary -tc- -nie- arising from a theoretical -r-
(ungeminated -<-) have already been discussed (see § 13,3). Examples
of -»-, -r- (-tc-; after syllable with nasal, -ntc,-), -tc- (after syllable with
nasal, -ntc-), -ts- (after syllable with nasal, -nts-), -γ-, and -yw-, as

   While the spirantizations illustrated above are live processes, that

c (s) are always geminated or long, regardless of etymological con-
siderations; e. g. M.i'ci'q-Laiyini MY HANDS ARE COLD (cf. ma-' HAND
above). Geminated -m·- also has largely supplanted spirantized
-tjw- (see 1 above). How geminated intervocalic consonants arose
is not clear. In part gemination is a grammatical process (e. g.
ivi- το DRINK < Shoshonean ipi-: ''i'p i- το DRINK REPEATEDLY); see
§ 58, 4, a, c-f. In general, however, we can not yet tell what brought

about the geminating power of certain stems and elements and the

between intervocalic geminated and ungeminated consonants is

clusive, that geminating stems or elements followed by a stem be-
ginning with a vowel insert a glottal stop; e. g. i ""AKpa- τ ο SLEEP

differ about the treatment of their final vowel before vowels, some
contracting, others inserting a ' . Thus, both ma-' and ta-"" combine
directly with a following vowel; e. g. maa'in-i- τ ο TOUCH and taa'in i-

            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                      67   (3) NASALIZATION. Nasalized consonants occur intervocalically
as a result of the nasalizing power of a stem or element; as the result
of reduplicating stems with interior nasal (e. g. qaijqa'ni- HOUSES
 < qan i- HOUSE; see § 58, 2, d); and internally in stems and elements
from obscure causes (in part these internal nasalizations may be
due to the assimilatory influence of a preceding nasal: e. g. nayqava-
EAR from Shoshonean *naka-, cf. Hopi nakuve, though elision of -a-
in parallel Shoshonean *nanaka-, cf. Gabrielino -nanax, may be a
preferable explanation; yet internal nasalization sometimes appears
where comparative evidence gives no apparent reason for it, e. g.
tuyu'mpa- sky, cf. Möhineyam duguba-t, Gabrielino takupa-r, yet also
Tübatulabal dogumha-l).
   Nasalized consonants that result from the nasalizing power of a
preceding element may be grouped into three classes: 1. -ntc- (-nts-)
that results from a -tc- (-ts-), original or itself developed from -t-
(see § 13, 3), that is either inherently ""spirantal"" or rather ungemi-
nated (e. g. -tea- preterital) or ""spirantized"" by a preceding stem
or element, provided there is a nasal consonant in the syllable pre-
ceding the -tc- (-ts-) (this type is not properly ""nasalized"" at all,
but is merely a secondarily nasalized development of the spirantized
group; see 1 above); 2. nasalized stops (andaffricatives) that alternate
with spirantized, but not geminated, consonants and that seem to
occur primarily, but not altogether, when the preceding .syllable
contains a -y- or -yw- (e. g. agentive -vi-, -mpi, alternating in no -vi-
CARRIER, taya-mpi- K I C K E R ) ; 3. nasalized stops (and affricatives)
that alternate with spirantized and geminated consonants. The
primary cause for the nasalization in the last group is generally
obscure. The presence of an interior nasal in the stem may be the
cause in some cases (e. g. taywa-"" TOOTH). Elision of a syllable
containing a nasal is demonstrable in a small number of cases (e. g.
pa'a-n το BE HIGH, participle pa'anti-·, cf. parallel pa'an i-). In cases
like usitative -mia-, -mi-""·, -kai- το HAVE, participle -kanfi-; perfective
-qai-, participle -q anfi- one suspects Shoshonean *-rnina-, *-kani-,
*-q ani- with ungeminated -η-, which would disappear between

certain amount of sporadic variation between spirantized and nasal-
ized consonants, in part depending on nasal assimilation, but not
altogether. Examples are:wits'i'its-      bird                          -Tjwmisi'ds·     in c o m p o u n d s   (-nts-

  together                                       form)  Less frequently an original nasalized consonant takes a spirantal
form, e. g.:
                Southern    Paiute,   a Shoshonean      Language
              SOUTHERN      PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN         LANGUAGE                    69NUxqwi'nt'i   stream ( <     NUzqwi'-n      a,Tjqa'pa.NUxqwdcitciT)w'i           red-

                                              then -leitet-)  Not infrequently also nasalized and geminated consonants inter-
change, e. g.:

  stone-clothes (obj.)                        tive form)  In the last three examples an original nasalized consonant has
become geminated, partly for assimilative, partly for dissimilative
reasons. In the first example the geminated consonant probably
represents the original form.
  Finally, there is some vacillation also between spirantized and
geminated consonants. A number of elements that are primarily
spirantizing are geminating in certain isolated forms, e. g.:τηα-' hand, ma-"":                           MA'pa'iyavu<j>i palm; MA'tca'i'-
                                              ayqi-    t o reach f o r ;   MA'pi'k    i-
                                              to touch with the hand
mu-' nose (e. g. mu-rona- to strike         Mu'pwi'k i<j>i mucus
 with one's nose), mu-""·.
   Quite distinct from this group, which evidently constitutes an
archaic stratum (thus, there is no verb -pih i- without prefix), are ex-
amples of stems which are inherently spirantizing but are treated as
geminating when compounded with stems that occur independently.
It is particularly verb (including adjective) stems, followed by noun
or verb stems, that are so treated. Thus, arjqa-' RED (cf. aijqa-ya- το
B E RED, aiiqa-r'ua- ΤΟ TURN RED) acts like a geminating arjqa-"" in such
forms as ayqa'-p ayV RED FISH, TROUT, arjqa'-q ani RED HOUSE.

Similarly, hi-'      τ ο DRINK (cf. ivi-yu-        WHEN DRINKING) forms ivi'-p                a-
7 ( A ) I - το DRINK WHILE WALKING.     However, these tendencies are not
consistently carried out. Thus, both ayqa'-q wica-R'i RED-FLASHING,
LIGHTNING and ayqa'-xwic α- το FLASH RED are found.            Such details
are of merely lexicographic interest. The tendency to use geminated
consonants in composition is probably due to the greater phonetic
similarity thus brought about between a simplex and its compound.
I t is the first step towards the dulling of a consciousness of consonantal
alternations and towards their development into mere historical
survivals.","[81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88]"
"
Mourning Ceremony     or ""Cry""118   As far east as the Paiutes of Muddy River, Nevada, and the Sibits of
St. George, but not as far as the Kaibab Paiutes, penetrated the annual
""Crying"" or Mourning Ceremony. This took place every summer (June
or July), rarely in the winter, and was intended to keep alive the memory
of dead relatives. Sacrifice was made by piling together in a heap objects
of value, such as blankets and baskets, also horses that had been shot,
and putting the whole on fire. An origin myth tells how the birds and
other animals, when they were people, came together long ago some-
where and bemoaned the fact that many were dying. The various animals
sang their characteristic mourning songs and these are now sung by the
Indians of today. In the ceremony four groups of singers are found,
each singing its characteristic songs. They are roan, coyote, birds (roost-
ers and others) and mountain sheep. These sets of songs are different
in general character and are accompanied by different motions. There
are over 200 of them. The ""roan"" songs all begin with the word wäEfm
and, like all the other songs, are composed of unintelligible words,
presumably Mohave. 119 The ""roan"" singers kneel facing each other, their
leader being in the center between the lines, and nowadays accompany
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes              835 their singing by means of tin cans filled with shot. They have a peculiar
 slanting downward motion of the hands. A man might join any group
 of singers, but only songs of a fixed kind were sung in any one group.
 Popular singers were paid for their services. The general expense of the
ceremony was born by two men, one of whom might be the brother of
a person that had died the preceding year. These visit the different
people of their own and neighboring bands and tell all to come together
at a certain place for the ceremony.
    A ""Cry"" lasts five days and nights. One person and another whose
relatives have died make arrangements for the dance, and pay for the
feast; they let everybody know about it. According to myth, the cere-
mony originated in California. 120 They sing till 12:00 at night. On the
last night, they sing up to morning. Then the clothes and blankets are
burned. Animals and horses (sometimes 100)121 are driven to the moun-
 tains and choked. ""Birds"" stand in the road and go back and forth.
 ""Coyotes"" jerk the right arm up and down to imitate the trotting of
 Coyote. ""Mountain sheep"" hold both hands in front and pull them up
 and down. ""Roan"" singers line up opposite each other and sit and stand
 alternately when tired. In the last night, people are not allowed to sleep.
About six officers keep them awake with pushing of a ""policeman's""
club. If one sleeps, he will get so sick that no medicine-man can cure
him. In the beginning of the dance, there is a cry of about ten minutes
at the command of a certain man, generally head of singing. Before
 that there is a ""friendship"" ceremony in which two parties of people
 face each other. People arrive at the meeting-place agreed upon in
 several parties. When the second party arrives they all dismount from
 their horses and line up to face a line composed of those who have
already arrived. The two lines approach each other and shake hands
and sing a song of friendship. The Cry leader goes around and tells
people about dead relatives to make them feel bad. [See Figure 13.]
Two girls back up towards the center line; the leader and assistant face
the girls. Home people gradually come closer and visiting people follow,
four in flank (not file). The leader explains his circuit around the center
line. As soon as he reaches the center, he tells them to go ahead and
cry. They cry two or three minutes. The leader sings together with four
while moving and circuiting. There is no particular time for making the
three center lines.
    A ""period"" of a roan song should be sung in one single breath,
otherwise the continuity of the song is broken. A new breath is taken
just before the second waiün. While a song is sung, the leader is already
836                      X Southern   Paiute and Ute
thinking of the next one, so that there is only a short pause before it.
As a rule, he tries to have each song sung only once during the night.
Once it is started again, it should be finished anyway.
   Some roan songs have many words with long periods. Such are not
apt to be as well known as others, only the leaders being entirely familiar
with them. The others would try to follow the leaders, keep up for
awhile, and lose the thread towards the latter part of the period.
   The annual Cry is said by a myth to have been introduced into the
Sibit122 (St. George) country by two old women long ago. They may be
seen as two rocks on opposite sides of the Virgin River a little below
Virgin City.
   The ""new way"" of singing certain songs was first heard by Tony at
a dance held at East Fork [of the Sevier River] in Escalante country by
a St. George man in 1901.
   In the ""Cry"" dance many bands participated together at a certain
place agreed upon, differing for each time perhaps; everyone had to be
let know about it before the party came to their particular place. The
""song leader"" and ""speech leader"" are separate people appointed before;
each group of songs has its leader.
   Some good ""Cry"" singers of the Muddy River Indians can dream
their songs, like the Mohave.
   [There should be payment] in the case of a song leader in a cry dance.
In the ""cry"" of 1901 held at East Fork [of the Sevier River], the song
leader was from St. George or Muddy River. No payment was agreed
upon beforehand; after the ceremony he was given payment. The pay-
ment used not to be great; anything at all would do that would show
his services were appreciated. If he were not paid, he would say nothing,
but the next time one of his band was requested to be a song leader,
they would refuse to do anything for stingy people.
   Some of the ""cry"" songs belonged together in a set of two or three
and were sung together. Such were called ""brothers."" As a rule, there
was no fixed order to the songs; they might follow in any order as
determined at the moment by the song leader. There was no particular
length to a ""cry"" song. If they came to the end of a ""set of periods,""
the leader might tell them to go ahead and continue the song.
   No mistake must be made in the singing of a ""Cry"" song. If one
makes an error, he will waste away with consumption.
   The leader has a rattle of a baking powder can filled with shot, held
in the right hand as a rattle.123
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic   Field   Notes         837Cry Dance of 1901   In 1901, Tom and Joe P ' ^ a x w i t ' 1 (both of Kanab) gave the Cry
dance for Tom's father who died two or three years ago. Joe was Tom's
uncle, brother of the deceased (the deceased man was not a chief, but
was rich and considered rather prominent). In the fall of 1900 council
was held at Kanab (niäviqwaix y ap' 'council'; niäviampayai' 'talk in
council'; women may talk in council, but hardly ever do). Mamputs
had come from Escalante in order to arrange for the Cry. It was arranged
to have the Cry in July of 1901. Tom had dropped a hint but not
explicitly said he would have a Cry; the hint was carried abroad to the
Arizona Paiutes and Muddy Rivers; in council all were Kanabs except
Mampiifs and assistant who went along with him. They met at the main
camp (of Young William with whom Tom was staying), but there was
no particular rule about the place of meeting. Tom was asked if he
would have a Cry; Tom then addressed the assembly and indirectly
asked Frank Mustache of St. George if he would get singers, whereupon
Frank said he would do what he could and, if some St. George person
would not act as song leader, he would be willing to do so. Frank said
he would see to it and get a ""whole set"" of St. George people to help
 — one for talker, one for roan song leader (Tom Rice), and one for
assistant roan song leader (Sally Rice, Tsäxuts), while for other songs
(bird and coyote songs, greeting song) they expected to get help from
Muddy River, also roan singer from St. George (John Domingo); the
bird song leader of Muddy River, who used to be St. George, named
Wcanuxqwemi ~ W e an e nq wemi 'Bent Penis,"" coyote song leader of Muddy
River who was once of St. George was named Pävuts 'Little Spring (?)',
the greeting song man from Muddy River named ' wo ""tsf'. After the day
was set for the Cry, letters were written to Cedar City (Captain Peter124
is chief of the Cedar City band, of whom there are now about 30) and
to St. George. News came from St. George that they would come for
the Cry and all were looking forward to the Cry in July at YiVimparir
'East Fork' [of the Sevier River] (name = 'stream of water at which
pines end'), because Tom's father used to live around there (Escalante
band, dialect probably more like Cedar City; Q' u 'cärump' people at
Grass Valley [on the Sevier], chief Oäqar). Everybody saved money to
dress well (but absolutely no Indian finery) for a great time.
  The Kanab Indians in the middle of June camped about one or two
miles east of Kanab, getting ready for the Cry (at a place called
W e aqoa + aitc' 'cedar grove bend, semi-circular cedar grove', where there
838                      X Southern   Paiute and Ute
was much good grass for pasture). Word was sent by one man to St.
George; he came back before July and said that many Muddy River
Indians would in two days come to St. George and that both bands
would then come together to Kanab. Then a man from St. George
(Pävuts) arrived at Kanab late in June; he came first in order to eat
rabbits with the Kanab people (not many rabbits around St. George;
in earlier days they used to hunt for rabbits around Mt. Trumbull); he
led in coyote and bird singing by way of preliminary in the evenings.
About July 5th or 6th, Frank Mustache went out very early to meet
the St. George and Muddy River Indians; he came back before noon
and reported that he had met them about nine at Pipe Spring (m""tiq' w
'mountain point running out into plain') and accompanied them for
some distance and that by noon they would be at the small town named
""Fredonia'"" 25 about 12 miles south of Kanab (called Ätsqav). Tom and
Joe started out immediately on Frank's report towards Fredonia, where
they met them, returned with them in the afternoon, led them to camp,
and went over to their own people. There were about 150 guests, of
whom about 85 were of St. George (only men and women, no children).
If they had not been met on the road by Tom and Joe, they would
naturally have been insulted at the slight. Then immediately upon arrival
(about 5 p.m. of July 7th), before putting up tents or even unhitching
horses, ""greeting"" took place at which 'wc""tsiS1 was leader (Tom Rice
and two girls served as assistants; this was the only time when Tony
noticed assistants at a Cry, but he had only witnessed one other). As
soon as they cried, they broke up, attended to the horses, and put up
tents. That evening they had bird singing with ""Broken Penis"" as leader
until midnight (nearly all bird songs and some roan songs were new
songs that were composed by Muddy River Indians, chiefly by one
certain man indefinitely referred to as Tant'ivwaiwiaYant"" 'western
singer'; some were entirely new, others were new versions of old songs;
coyote songs were almost all old ones). For about two nights after there
was no singing nor anything during the day. On the third day after
arriving all three bands proceeded northeast to East Fork. They camped
the first night at Skürumpä (English name;126 called in Paiute: Squr-
umpa £ ya' 'mouth of rabbit-bush canyon'; sqümp™ 'rabbit bush',
-tümpa'ya' 'mouth of canyon'), where there is a ranch. No singing was
done that evening. The next day they went on again and camped in a
canyon called Tc' ax qöarumpätc' 'Wild Geese Spring'. That evening they
sent two men — Paria John (Kanab Indian named Yin'ivwuts 'Bald
head'); the other man was an Arizona Paiute who lived with the Kanabs
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes            839because of marriage with a Kanab woman, named Tivwik'y 'Dirty
Ground mixed with sticks clinging to brush' — on to East Fork to the
other camp (Cedar City, Arizona Paiutes, and Grass Valley Indians,
and some Shoshone from Western Utah; about 300 or more altogether).
They arrived on horseback in the middle of the night at East Fork,
where a round dance was being held; they informed them of the arrival
of the western bands; they returned the next day and met the Kanab
and two other bands at noon little more than halfway between ""Wild
Geese Spring"" and East Fork, accompanied by most of the Arizona
Paiutes (Mamputs had been at East Fork but had already left because
he got mad at something). All together now started off, the Arizona
Paiutes going on ahead. When two miles from East Fork camp, all of
the three first bands stopped and dressed; there they were met by
Pyravurav11 'Flour Arm' (not regularly sent but came on his own
account; he was a St. George Indian who had married a Kanab woman;
some Kanabs already had come to East Fork). They went on from
there and came in sight of the main camp about four or five o'clock.
The East Fork people already were in a line (row), also three other
bands advanced in flank motion. The latter got off and advanced to
within about 100 yards of the other line. (When about a half mile from
East Fork and already in flank form, old William circled around on his
horse and addressed them. Tony does not remember what was said. The
same flank movement and prepared line had been followed at Kanab.)
The second greeting took place under the leadership of 'w*'tsi"", who
sang a different song this time. The horses were unhitched and put out
to pasture, and camps erected; they started in to sing about 7 or 8 after
supper. There were three groups of singers — roan, bird, and coyote —
not disposed in any formal order. All three had rattles; there was no
difference in the form of the rattles. The three groups sang ahead
regardless of each other; they quit at about midnight. There is no regular
rule about singers; they can stop at any time or join one of the other
groups. No dancing was done during the singing.
   The roan singers line up in two rows who face each other, the leader
being in the center of one of the rows. Part of the time they kneel, part
of the time they stand, according to the precedent set by the leader.
Bird singers always stand, also in two rows facing each other; they move
back and forth in flank formation somewhat in Bear Dance style, but
not with so lively a step; they gently shuffle along (feet slid forward
slightly alternately), at the same time slightly and gently bending or
swaying the body forward; the rattle in the right hand is gently moved
840                      X Southern   Paiute and Ute
obliquely down to right as it is held in front slightly to left, while the
palm of the left, elbow bent, is held out facing in and made gently to
follow the rattle movement by moving from up left to down right; the
rattle is allowed to touch the palm at each beat. Bird singers cover a
distance of about 30 to 40 feet. Coyote singers stand or kneel like roan
singers, with no characteristic motion (?). Mountain sheep always stand
but do not move, and never kneel. (Both Coyote and Mountain sheep
singers face each other in two rows.) They hold fists out with flexed
elbows and move them down parallel to each other. Mountain sheep
singers were had only the last night in 1901. Various groups of singers
not called ""coyotes"" or ""birds."" 127 Those not singing can do as they
please — talk, sit about a campfire. The singers are in the center of the
dance ground; the campflres were at the edge of the dance ground all
about (about eight of them). The camps were always put up in the
direction of the dance ground from which that particular party came;
the dance ground was a clear acre flat surrounded by big pines. Singing
was done during five nights, including the first on arrival. Nothing
much was done before noon; good times (Bear dances, Round dances,
foot races, horse races, wrestling, target shooting, card gambling) took
place on the third day after arrival; the Bear Dance was held twice; the
Round Dance on the second evening (when they had no cry singing);
foot races and target shooting were held on the fourth day; gambling
of course at any time. On the third, fourth, and fifth nights there was
""cry"" singing again; the same songs were sung, but not necessarily in
the same order. These last three nights the ""talker"" went about on the
dance ground and talked out loud to the people, reminding them of
their dead relatives and trying to make them sad. At the end of every
five roan songs, there is a slight pause during which an abbreviated cry
greeting takes place. All the people, also the non-roan-singers, join the
roan singers and make up two long lines who face each other. The
greeting leader comes in in the center, sings, and tells them to cry (no
hand-shaking or moving about); it was said that to cry after every four
songs would be too much of a strain on the people. Only during the
""cry"" part in the evening are there officers; there were two for Kanab
and one for each of the other bands. These were to see to it particularly
that no young couples went off sparking in the brush; in earlier days
they had no officers but complaints were made by the older Indians
about the loose conduct of the younger men, so they introduced officers
who had clubs or sticks, but did not generally need to use them. In the
last night, singing is kept up until dawn, when the burning has finished.
                    Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic   Field   Notes        841Everyone must be awake during the whole of this night. In the early
morning, as soon as everything is burned, they all separate, the ""cry""
being finished.
   In 1901 the burning pile was erected about 100 yards east of the
dance ground; this was done in the afternoon of the last day. Meanwhile,
offerings for the burning were made. Anyone would stretch out a rope
between two trees and different people would suspend various articles
of value (such as baskets, silk handkerchiefs, shawls, blankets, and other
articles of clothing) from it; several such ropes would be stretched. All
articles suspended on a rope are meant to be sacrificed to the dead
relatives of the donor. Also, horses are tied by ropes to the trees and
are considered sacrifices in the same way. A certain man has been
chosen to conduct this part of the ceremony and to talk out to the
people. As soon as an offering has been made, the original owner has
no further claim to it, no matter how valuable it is; he has already done
his share for the sake of his dead relative. After the offerings have been
made, the man chosen for the ceremony talks to the people and tells
them they may exchange if they wish. This seems to have been done
chiefly with horses; if a very good horse has been offered, a man (not
the sacrificer) may come and unhitch it and tie a poorer horse of his
own in its place, which poorer horse will then be sacrificed in its stead,
the good one now belonging to the exchanger. There was one Kanab
man who sacrificed a good horse (he had no poor ones); a friend of his
substituted a broncho of his own; when they got back home, he returned
the good horse to its original owner of his own accord. This was
considered perfectly proper. The sacrificer had shown his readiness to
part with something valuable, while his friend had helped him out by
saving the good horse for him; both received credit for their acts. Also,
blankets might be exchanged, though apparently less frequently than
with horses. As soon as the exchanging is over, the articles sacrificed
are worn during that night for the last time by anyone who happens to
take each first; the same object may be worn by different people by
turns. An object, particularly such as a handkerchief, may be torn up
into little strips and worn by different people (first one man might tear
off a strip, then another, and so on until it is all torn up).
   During the last part of the singing during the night, the woodpile is
set on fire. When the roan singers have begun their very last song, all
the four groups of singers get up and slowly shuffle on in flank formation
towards the woodpile, keeping on singing, while all the other people go
along in the same direction. As soon as they arrive at the burning pile,
842                       X Southern   Paiute and   Ute
all the sacrificed articles being worn are thrown into the fire; at the
same time the sacrificed horses have been led up to a neighboring
mountain and are shot. At the burning other articles not already put
on a rope may be sacrificed. Thus one girl from Kanab, who had put
on two dresses, took off the upper one and threw it into the fire. Crying
goes on during the burning, also the roan singing. As soon as the singing
is over, the ceremony is at an end, and everyone seems to be eager to
get away as soon as possible.
   At the time of the Cry of 1901, Tom, who had learned much from
the Utes, led in a peculiarly Ute (not Paiute) ""dance."" A line of horsemen
riding bareback with ropes for reins circled around clockwise, two
moving abreast. Tom, the leader, held a drum made of a pail with a
piece of buckskin stretched over the opening in his left and beat it with
a drumstick held in his right. They all sang to his drumming. This is
the only drum Tony has ever heard of in use among the Paiutes. 128
   The object of the ""cry"" is to show respect for dead relatives; there is
no idea of sending property to the spirit world, but goods are sacrificed
merely to show love and disregard of wealth for their sake. There is no
necessity of sacrificing if you don't want to, but it would look mean if
one did not sacrifice at least something, even if only a trifle, if a relative
has recently died. It is enough to sacrifice at the first ""cry"" after a death,
not necessarily thereafter. A ""cry"" can be held anytime, but is generally
held in summer (June or July). About 1898 (latter part of July), a ""cry""
was held about 6 or 8 miles below Cedar City (Muddy, St. George,
some Shoshone, Kaibab, Escalante, Cedar, but no Arizona [people were
present]); about 1904 (some time in May), a ""cry"" took place between
""Cain Patch"" 129 and Rockville at Siümpäts ~ Ciümpäts 'gravel spring'
(St. George, Kanab, and Cedar only); about 1903 (November), a ""cry""
was held at Point Spring (Pav(/aväts) at the Indian pasture near (three
miles east of) Moccasin Spring (only Kanab); in 1902 (early in spring)
a ""cry"" was held at Oäitümpai'yc< 'mouth of Salt canyon' (directly east,
about seven miles from Moccasin Springs, at Point Spring, on road to
Kanab and just outside of Indian pasture) (only Kanab); in 1899 a
""cry"" was held seven miles west of Kanab at Cottonwood Springs in
winter (only Kanab); about 1904 (July) a ""cry"" was held at gati' 'end
of canyon' about 30 — 40 miles northwest of St. George (Mt. Meadow
is about 15 miles south of it) (all bands); in 1909 (July), a ""cry"" was
held at the same place as in 1898 (all bands except Arizona, also some
Shoshones); before 1894 two ""cries"" were held at Sam City.130 Utes
never come to ""cries"" nor other tribes besides those above enumerated.
                     Kaibab   Paiute Ethnographic   Field   Notes   843Ghost   Dancem   In the Ghost Dance they used to have a dance-corral or fence
(generally, but not always) consisting of cedar or preferably willow
branches piled thick and neatly to a height of four or five feet, with
four gates or openings about four feet wide, the diameter of the circle
being about 60 — 75 feet. Planted in the center they used to have a cedar
pole about 25 feet high, from the top of which depended a string to
which two feathers were tied, one a big eagle tail-feather painted red,
the other one of the soft white feathers under an eagle's tail-feather.
There was no restriction about touching the pole. Instead of the pole,
the prophet whose dreamt songs were sung would put a cane of service-
berry wood smoothed nicely and symmetrically with a carved hook or
knob at the top in the center; from it the same two feathers hung. 132
Only the prophet (pärüxuts, now used also to mean anyone that com-
poses a Round Dance) could touch the cane and feathers; when the
dance was over he took it home with him and stood it up at the doorway
or at the head of his bed, where nobody could touch it. Several prophets
had canes and feathers, some of whom were Kaibabs. Tony was then
about five years old. They generally started about 7 p.m. and kept it
up till midnight. The dancing kept up day after day for many months,
perhaps a year or two. Nothing was done during the day. Everyone was
supposed to go to the dance, otherwise he would turn into a crow,
stone, or some other animal or object. During the dance, the prophets
would suddenly fall into a trance and, on awakening, prophesy various
things, such as the approach of a storm; they claimed that if the people
danced, their dead relatives would come back to life. Now the Indians
do not like to sing these songs, for they claim the dances ""ate up"" the
people, all the prophets having died, probably from over-exertion.
Dancing was done clockwise in the same manner as an ordinary round
dance. There were no special costumes worn for the ghost dance.","[838, 839, 840, 841, 842, 843, 844, 845, 846, 847]"
"   A few remarks on verbs of doing and saying are all we need offer
here. As numerous examples scattered through this paper have
already shown, verbs of doing and saying are frequently used in
Paiute in a wider sense than is customary in English. Verbs of
doing, i. e. verbs in -n i- (§ 26, 2, b; § 43, 3; § 44, 2, a), often refer, in a
loose manner, to any activity or state but those of speech, sound,
and mental operation. A correspondingly loose reference to activi-
ties and states of the latter sort is made by verbs of saying (ui- and
mai-, § 43, 6). Thus, un i- τ ο DO and ai- το SAY are equivalently
used in expressions in -n-a-c-u-(vw'i~) (ONE'S OWN) — I N G AGAIN imply-
ing continuous and exclusive activity, e. g.:tTqa'n-Acuv %ni'kiA he keeps on eating (lit., does his own eating again)

"  (2) A B S O L U T E V E R B FORMS. A S has been abundantly illustrated,
verb forms, even aside from nominal derivatives (§ 25, 1-6), often
appear without either enclitic or suffixed tense elements. Such
forms may be conveniently termed absolutes. They are used under
various circumstances:
   (a) When tense (and pronominal) elements arc appended to an-
other preceding word in the sentence, the verb appears as an absolute,
e. g.:
               Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean     Language
            SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                    235
a'itcayani qu'qwi then-preterit-him (vis.)-I shoot, then I shot him;
   contrast qu'qwi'tea-yaw I shot him
   (b) In imperative forms (see § 52).
   (c) Frequently in interrogative forms, where reference is had to
present time.
   (d) Generally substantive verbs (aro'a-, uru'a-, § 56) have no
present suffix, present (or general) time being implied when there is
no tense suffix.
   (e) Verbs of BEING and HAVING in -Icai- (§ 26, 1, a and b) take no -xji-
toexpress present time, but are tenseless, e. g. qant!%aini I HAVE A
HOUSE.    It is probable that in such cases -Icai- represents an old
contraction of -kai-y'i-, as the -y'i- reappears after an intervening
impersonal 4-ua- (see § 29, 14; § 32, 8).","[252, 253]"
"  (2) S U R V E Y OF CONSONANTAL DEVELOPMENTS. We shall give here
a rapid survey of consonantal developments, showing the relation of
the consonantal forms actually found (including several not listed
above) to the primary consonants.
   (a) Unvoicing. The aspirated stops (y ; ρ""; V; k', fc? —generally
written kf; k\ q ; kw, qw), written simply p, t, and so on, before
voiceless vowels (e. g. pi, tA); the aspirated affricatives (tc', ts),
written tc, ts before voiceless vowels (e. g. tci); most of the voiceless
spirants (φ; φ""; w; χ; γ; χ; χ; xw;'); the voiceless or partly voiceless
nasals (μ, mM; mw; Ν, nN; ψν); and the voiceless rolled R are all
developed from the corresponding unaspirated or voiced forms, or
as glides, in connection with the unvoicing of moras (see § 8). It
is unnecessary to detail these developments here.
   The unaspirated stops and affricatives occur as such only initially
before a voiced vowel and medially after an unvoiced vowel (e. g.
pitci-, A'pii-); otherwise they are either ""nasalized"" (e. g. ampaya-,
                       X Southern Paiute and Ute
46                                 SAPIR
aintci-; see § 16, 3) or ""geminated"" (e. g. fivwaq-a-, i'ip-i-; see § 16, 2).
Aspirated stops and affricatives may also be nasalized or geminated
(e. g. q-A, nt'i). The typical unaspirated stop or affricative is probably
an ""intermediate"" when nasalized, geminated, or medial after a
voiceless vowel (in which case it is always geminated in origin;
see § 10, 1); and a true surd when initial before a vowel. However,
it is difficult to be certain as to these two modes of articulation. The
""intermediate"" quality is most certain after nasals before voiced
vowels and in the release of unaspirated geminated stops and affrica-
tives. I t is possible that the attack of the geminated stop and
affricative is a true surd.
   (b) Spirantization. All spirants (except s, c; w, W\ y, Υ; χ, ί, ';
Α-, '-) and rolled consonants (Τ, R) are developed from stopped con-
sonants (see § 16,1); ψν (η) is either ""spirantized"" from in (see § 16,1)
or developed from intervocalic w (see § 13, 2). ν (ψ) is bilabial in
articulation; for »"" (φ"") see § 14,3, b. r (R) is lightly trilled, apparent-
ently in typically alveolar position, probably modified slightly by
its tendency to take on vocalic timbres; it was never heard as d.
7 is either fully voiced (as in North German Tage) or intermediate
(χ); for y see below.
   (c) Geminated or long consonants. For geminated stops and
affricatives see (a) above. Intervocalic m, n, rj, and s, c are very
frequently heard long. I t is highly probable that this, particularly
for m·, «·, and s·, c-,is their etymologically typical form and that
original Shoshonean intervocalic short m, n, and s, possibly also
•η, have disappeared as such. Long χ·, x w (x'tv), x· generally occur
as developments of γ, yw, y in voiceless positions (see § 8), rarely
intervocalically (see § 13, 5, c).
   (d) Glottalized consonants. For glottalized stops and affricatives
(e. g. ρ, ή-, (c) and nasals (m'm, n'n, rj'w) see § 15, 2, b.
   (e) Anterior palatals. Aside from y (and its voiceless development
y), anterior palatals (including labialized anterior palatals) develop
from back palatals (and labialized back palatals); see § 13, 4.
  (f) Rounded labial consonants. Aside from w (and its voiceless
development w), these are all developed from ordinary labial con-
sonants; see § 14, 3, b.
  (g) Alternation of k and q. B y q is meant a back palatal stop of
moderately velar articulation. Its average position, as determined
                  Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean       Language
               SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                     47
by such a group as aqa, is distinctly further back than our English
k- position in cold, yet not so decidedly velar in character as q of
such a language as Kwakiutl. Its greatest degree of velarity is
reached in such examples as qo'oi- and toyoqwi-, i. e. before and after
a. We shall use q and qw after all vowels but i, when followed by
any vowel other than i. Before i the back palatal becomes distinctly
more forward in articulation, about like the k- sound of English
cold or perhaps even can; this position is here normally designated as
k, kw. After an i the k becomes an anterior palatal (see e above).
Positions analogous to k (kw) and q (qw) are doubtless to be found
also in the spirants 7 (χ, χ), yw (xw, xw). Thus, y of toyo'qwi-
is certainly more velar than y of üyi'a-,    However, these phonetic
distinctions have here been neglected.   (h) Alternation of s and c. These two sibilants are respectively
pronounced as in English sip and ship, except that c tends to approach
a quality intermediate between the true s and c. There is some
sporadic interchange between s and c·, as between is and tc, but on
the whole they are used with considerable distinctness according to
vocalic position. For secondary assimilations see § 13, 8.
   Initially, s is regularly used before a, i, and a; c before ϊ (which
often develops to ί, ι; see § 3, 2, b) and u. Examples are: sa- RAW,
san a- GUM, sa'a- ΤΟ BOIL, saywa- B L U E , sayw(e)ia-   B E L L Y , sarjwa-

CD - ONE, cuniai- ΤΟ THINK OF, cururuirinoa-    SMOKE-HOLE, cu(w)ai- ΤΟ
BE GLAD. These rules are only infrequently violated, e. g. caywa-,
less frequent form of saywa- B L U E ; co ya - ΤΟ BEND, con i- TINDER.
    Medially, both preceding and following vowel must be considered.
Before a, 1, and u, c regularly appears, regardless of what vowel
precedes the sibilant, e. g. viaa'-c-aywa- BRUSH-BLUE, GREEN (con-
trast saywa- above), qwic a- το SPARK, qic aui- HAWK, toc a- white,

48                                  SAPIRogy of a simplex in sa- may explain many of these cases. Before i,
s regularly appears if i or a precedes, but c if I, u, or ο precedes, e. g.
tümp^i'si^axanfi           ROCK HAVING A CRACK; a,si- ROAN-COLORED,
as-ia— SURFACE, qwasi- TAIL, ti'rasi-             POTATOES; aici-       BASKET
( - E I - not < -E T-, as shown by assibilation of t to tc in aic-dcu- ΤΟ MAKE
A BASKET, see § 13, 3), ay'wic ι- ΤΟ SNEEZE (-c t- < -c-ϊ-, not -cü-, as
shown by palatalized k in plural arfvyi'cka-, see § 13, 4); non oc i- τ ο
DREAM, true -i-, cf. plural nem o'c ha-); rfqu'ci^ia            NOCK (true -i-,
as shown by palatalized χ). Of these -asi- tends to vary with less
frequent -aci-, e. g. ta-na'cL%a- CLEFT IN HOOF (cf. pi-na's-ιχα- B E -
T W E E N ONE'S LEGS), tA'pa'clcai-       WAS SENSELESS (perhaps -a's-i-
tends to become a'c ι-, b u t -as i'- to remain). Before o, s seems
to be regular if a or i precedes, while both s and c have been found
when ο precedes, e. g. pA'ss'raraitci WATERFALL; pis-'a- CHILDREN;
os oroqwi- TO SNORE, qoc ov'i- TINDER.
    The rule is far simpler for the use of tc and ts. The former is
regularly employed before ο, ϊ, o, and u; the latter only before i (which
then often develops to i, see § 3, 2, b). These rules apply both
initially and medially. Examples are: tea - WRINKLED, MA'tca'iayqi-
TO REACH FOR; tciya- DUCK, itci- THIS; tcoi- BEAD, qi'tco'xwd.i' CHEWS;
tcuxwi- ΤΟ APPROACH, patcu'q u BEAVER; tsipi- ΤΟ APPEAR, tot si-
HEAD. There is a slight tendency for ts to appear before a medially
and before ο both initially and medially, e. g. viantsatjwina- ΤΟ THROW
DOWN SEVERAL OBJECTS; qatsoa - (also qatcoa·-) TOP, tsoavi- SHOULDER.
As for quality, tc and ts are not as clearly distinct as are ch and ts
of English church and hats respectively, ts in particular tending to an
intermediate point of articulation; tc is probably purest before ϊ
and u, also when developed from f (see § 13, 3).","[63, 64, 65, 66]"
"   Interjections are of two types: simple vocables expressing emotion
or desire and without definite grammatical form; and words of
definite grammatical form, generally adverbs or terms of demon-
strative origin, that are secondarily employed as interjections.",[290]

  Under this term are included a considerable number of elements
of prevailingly instrumental significance. They are used chiefly
with verb forms, but not exclusively. In nouns they may in part
be employed non-instrumentally, nor is the properly instrumental
function always apparent in verb forms. Their origin is largely ob-
scure, b u t certain analogies suggest strongly t h a t they are on the
whole specialized forms of incorporated nouns with instrumental
function (see § 18, 2, f, a ) ; to some extent they may be related to
verb stems.

  (9) tsi-° WITH THE POINT OF A LONG OBJECT, STICK.               This is a
very frequent instrumental prefix. Examples are:

  ( 1 0 ) wi->    WITH   THE   LENGTH   OF   A LONG   OBJECT,   STICK.   The

stereotyped forms, e. g.:

ci'pa'i'aiyim   I feel cold (lit., I die of cold; eip-a- as incorporated

  Possibly also:

in force, as shown, e. g., by its alternation with other instrumental

prefixes (e. g. ma-, ta-°, tsi-°). Its precise force, however, is far
from clear. Perhaps it denotes indefinite instrumentality. In some
cases it seems to refer, like νια-, to the HAND. Examples are:
tcA'pa'niui' shakes (with the hand) (cf. tAKpa'ntu- to shake with the
   feet)
icq'u'wa.i' scratches (with the hand) (cf. tq'y,'wa.i' scratches with the

tcA'qo'itcai' takes off clothes (cf. mayo'itcai' takes off gloves, bracelets,
   armlets)
tca-'mp'in'na·-      to raise so as to uncover (ica-i'mpin'na·-) (cf. mai'-
   mp'in a-Tjqi- to raise covering from)
tcA'pa'qxii'NA        to tear into two pieces; tcAxpa'y(a)itca- to tear to
   pieces (cf. to'pa'ydca- to rip open in several places; wii'rjwVpaq-m'NA
   knife-edge-tear-momentaneous-causative, to rip open with a knife)
ican-o'rjqwayqivan-i        will pull (feathers, hairs) out by force

tcA'p'i'nilcirjup'iyain-L (it) appeared like open, darkness cleared up
   (16) ο-, assimilated u- ROUND OBJECT, HOLE (O-° before momentan-
eous forms, a-' before durative forms). This element occurs only
in a few stereotyped forms:
o'pa'q i- to be (one-)holed, participle o'pa'q (a)itc'i with a hole,
   ovwa'xdcai- to have holes (derivatives from -paq ι-, -payi- to tear,
   see under tea- above)
u^pu'q wi- to bounce (like a ball) (cf. tA'pu'q-wi- to jump).
  This element is not a true instrumental, but rather a stereotyped
objective classifier. I t may, indeed, be used with true instrumental
prefixes, e. g. mao'p-Axqayqi- ΤΟ MAKE A HOLE BY STICKING ONE'S
HAND INTO.
  A few verbs in u-B referring to SLEEP or CLOSING ONE'S EYES may
possibly contain this element (ROUND OPENING metaphorically >
EYE?) :u'tu'c urjw'i L- to cause to go to sleep (cf. tu'cu'y'wi- to exercise
   power upon, to cause to do as one wishes)
u*tcu'm'mi- to have one's eye's closed, uHcu'm'ma·- to close one's eyes
   I t is just as possible, however, t h a t this u-° is assimilated from an
Ϊ-' that appears also in 'it'i'ifwa-ampaya-       ΤΟ TALK IN ONE'S SLEEP.   (17) pa-' WATER. This is nothing but the incorporated noun
stem pa·-', pa-' WATER used instrumentally. I t is listed here as a

108                                    SAPIK
prefix because it occurs in a number of verbs whose bare stems are
not found in use without it:
patca'qwa-    to get wet, patca'qwi- to be wet
pan'yi-   to wash (trans.), nava'riyi- to wash oneself
patca1qiijwa- to water, irrigate
   Less probably also:
nava'q'i-     to bathe (intrans.) (non-reflexive -paq'i- not found)
   The instrumental prefixes are much more closely connected with
the verb stem proper than any other elements preceding the stem,
e. g. adverbial prefixes, reflexive na- (see § 22, 1), or incorporated
nouns. An instrumental prefix comes nearest the stem. Owing to
this close connection, the psychological analysis becomes somewhat
obscured at times, so that the notion of instrumentality may be
repeated in a preceding incorporated noun, e. g. wii'-ywTpaq m'NA
τ ο RIP OPEN WITH A KNIFE (contains both instrumental incorporated
noun wii- KNIFE and instrumental prefix -tjw'i- < -ινϊ- WITH THE
BLADE OF A LONG OBJECT). Sometimes an instrumental prefix is
so closely identified with the stem that it may be preceded by another
instrumental prefix, e. g. MAlpi'k i- τ ο TOUCH (that ma-' is a prefix
is indicated by parallel tA'pi'ki- τ ο TOUCH WITH THE FOOT) : wima'-

5 as man iyiyu-; 6 as navai-. These forms do not suffer vocalic
unvoicing of their third mora. Examples are:cv'it ammA one-day-on, for one day ( = cv'yuc u tava'm.i)

"                   § 38. Classification of pronouns.
   Paiute pronouns may be divided into six classes: personal pronouns
(in part of demonstrative force); postnominal pronouns (closely
related to personal pronouns but used practically as articles); demon-
strative pronouns (in large part identical with independent third
personal pronouns); interrogative pronouns; relative pronoun; and
reflexive pronouns. All of these occur as independent stems. The
personal pronouns also appear in an enclitic form.
   The independent personal pronouns are either subjective or
objective. The enclitic series, however, makes the distinction only
for the second person and for one or two other forms that will be
specified later. The objective forms include possessive functions.
The classification of pronouns as to person is as follows:
  1st person singular
  1st person dual (inclusive)
  1st person plural (inclusive)
  1st person plural (exclusive)
  2nd person singular
  2nd person plural
  3rd person singular animate visible
  3rd person singular animate invisible
  3rd person plural animate visible
  3rd person plural animate invisible
  3rd person inanimate visible
  3rd person inanimate invisible
   I t will be observed that the only specifically dual form is that of
the 1st person inclusive. Aside from the first person plural inclusive,
all the plural pronominal elements include dual functions; the verb,
however, in the latter case is singular in form (cf. § 31). The in-
animate third person makes no distinction for number; cf. the lack of
plural suffixes for inanimate nouns (§ 48). The classification into
visible and invisible in the third person applies particularly to the
enclitic series. Independent pronouns of the third person are
formed from four distinct demonstrative stems, only one of which
implies invisibility (see § 39).

   (1)   FORMATION OF I N D E P E N D E N T PERSONAL ( A N D DEMONSTRATIVE)
PRONOUNS.     The objectives are formed from the subjectives by the
suffixing of -a- after all vowels but a, after which -ία-, -ya- is sub-

178                                SAPIRstituted. This is precisely as with nouns (§ 49, 1). The first person
singular, however, has a peculiar objective form, riin-ia-, based on an
otherwise non-occurring riin i- instead of rii-. Both subjective and
objective pronouns spirantize following elements (note that -r- be-
comes -tc- after i, -ntc- after nasal + i).
   The first person singular is rii' or mi when used absolutely, rii-
when followed by another element (e. g. postposition or modal
enclitic). The two inclusive pronouns are evidently based on a
common stem ta-, which does not occur uncompounded in Paiute;
but cf. Nahuatl ti WE, to- OUR. The -m-i- of tam-i- is probably identical
with that of mm-wi- WE (EXCLUSIVE) and mw'im-wi- YE; rii-mwi- is
probably based on ηϊ- I. The inclusive plural taijwa- probably goes
back to *tama- (§ 16, 1), perhaps assimilated from *tami- (cf. Hopi
itamö WE); if this is correct, -ywa- is probably ultimately identical
with animate plural -ywl- (§ 48, 1).
   The four sets of third personal and demonstrative pronouns are
based on the demonstrative stems a- THAT (indefinite); ma-, m^a'-
                                   i
THAT (visible or referred to); i-, 'i'- THIS; and Μ-, "" V - THAT (invisible).
The doublets with two moras (m w a'-, ! 'i'-, ""'u'-) do not seem to differ
in meaning from one-moraed forms (ma-, i-, u-); both types are
doubtless found in all animate (singular and plural) and inanimate
subjective and objective forms. The two-moraed forms seem to be
favored when the pronoun is used without suffix, the one-moraed
when used with postpositions. The second element in the third
personal pronouns is pronominal: -ya- for the animate singular; -m-'i-
(sometimes assimilated to -m-u-) for the animate plural (doubtless
identical in origin with animate plural suffix -νι·ϊ- in nouns, § 48, 1);
and -qa- or quasi-pronominal -ri- (-tci-) for the inanimate. In
the inanimate forms the more properly pronominal -q a- series is
far less common than the demonstrative -ri- series; -q a- forms seem
to be in common use in certain other dialects of Southern Paiute.
When used attributively, they follow the noun, while -fi- forms
precede. An enclitic -c-u- (§ 19, 2, k) is very frequently attached to
third personal pronouns, probably to all except inanimates in -q a- and
forms with two-moraed demonstrative stem. The chief character-
istic of -c-u- forms is apparently their more frequent substantive
use as true personal pronouns, other forms being employed with
more clearly demonstrative force, hence often attributively; never-
theless, -c-u- forms are also found used in a demonstrative (and
attributive) sense. In general, it is impossible to draw a hard and

tives, as they are all in structure demonstrative-personals. On the
whole, the purely demonstrative value is strongest in ma- (m w a'-) and
i (''«'-) forms, the personal in a- and u- (""'ω'-) forms.

independent personal pronouns, as of other pronouns and of nouns,
are used as subjects of verbs, unless these are subordinate; as objects
of imperatives (for examples see § 52); and, without -c «-, as bases
for attached postpositions (§ 50, 3). Examples of independent sub-
jective personal pronouns (including pronoun and postposition) are:

"   (2) R E D U C T I O N OF FINAL LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS. A final
long vowel or a diphthong loses its second mora before a word be-
ginning with a vowel, i. e. the long vowel is shortened, while the

   A final short vowel, reduced as above, may combine into a long
with the vowel of like quality that begins the following word; e.g.
tspi'rjuqwa y'a'V' antux • wA.
   ( 3 ) R E T E N T I O N OF FINAL VOWELS. The above rules do not apply
to monosyllables, which retain their second mora:

  Before ai-, *ai- ΤΟ SAY subjective independent personal pronouns
keep theil· final vowel. There is probably some morphological
reason back of this usage. Examples are:

  The same rule applies to subjective independent personal pronouns
before an i'-k-a- τ ο DO, except t h a t third personal pronouns (at least
animate singulars) lose their final vowel and insert a glottal stop
before the verb (cf. enclitic -aya'ya- < -arja- + -aya-, § 41, 1, e):

   Certain final vowels are protected from elision by taking on a
glottal stop. This is true of nominal or independent pronominal
subjects immediately followed by a substantive verb (see § 56),

  I t is likely t h a t here again we are not dealing with a purely phonetic
phenomenon.
  A protecting glottal stop is added also to the final α of the preterit
enclitics -ywa- and -(n)tca- (see § 19), provided they are directly
preceded by an independent personal pronoun and followed by a
word beginning with a consonant, e.g.:

with an initial ' of the next word into y'w:

  Vowels are unvoiced (indicated in our orthography by corresponding
small capitals) in two circumstances: when final in absolute position
or before a word beginning with a consonant (not including ' or ');
and initially or medially under certain conditions to be defined below.","[43, 44, 45]"
"  (5) TREATMENT OF y. The back-guttural y is apt to undergo
various modifications, aside from unvoicing (§ 8), palatalization (4
above), and labialization (§ 14, 3, c).   (a) Stopping to g. In poetry y is not infrequently stopped to
g (the sonant correspondent of q). In prose this occurs when a final
-y of the preceding word comes, by elision of an initial vowel (see §
10, 3, end), to stand immediately before the -γ-, e. g. a'ia-η ϊγϊκTHAT-HE INDEED >     a'ia-η gin.
   (b) Weakening or loss of y. An original y is sometimes weakened
to a glide y or even entirely lost before or after an u- vowel, more
often after an ϊ- vowel. Vocalic contractions may then result (see
§ 4). Examples are:
na-^u'q wi-yqi- to fight (lit., to       ncFu'q wnjqi-, na'uq wii]qi-
   shoot at each other < quq wi-
   to shoot)
yauywi- to enter                         ya-uywi-
fiyia- deer (-γ- may be glide,           Xi 'iamqua^i    deer-meat

y is sometimes heard not merely as an intermediate χ , with which
it varies frequently, but as a fully unvoiced χ (or lengthened i );
similarly y > x. This sharpening seems to be frequent after an
accented a, particularly in the neighborhood of a glottal stop, e. g.:
-ayava- yu- right among                  a a'xavaiyu     right in there

   (6) VOCALIZATION OF SEMIVOWELS. T h e semivowels y and w
are sometimes opened up to the corresponding vowels i and u {o).
Forms with glide -i- (§5, 1) are transitional; e. g. -aya- > -a(i)ya- >
-aia-. Examples of -y- > -i- are:
nampa'-ya rjA his foot (obj.)            ηαηνρα'ία ηΛ
narja- anger + y(a)'ai- to die of         naija'i'ai-
  > naya'y'ai- to be angry
  After an i, the i < y apparently disappears as such, fusing with
the preceding vowel, e. g.:
tuqwi-    shame + y(a)'ai-               tu'qwi'ai-    to be ashamed
tsi- with the point + yauywL-
   tca- to cause several objects to      1sia-'u*>witcAp'iya' caused (them)

                                           point (§ § 4, 1, a; 13, 5, b)
  A w immediately following a back-palatal stop or i) is sometimes
opened to u or still further, before a, to 3 (cf. development of -wa- to
-wo-, -ο-; § 3, a, 3), e. g.:
-ntcuqw(-ruqw)        avi"" underlies     imi'ntcuq-u avi"" lies under thee;

54                                        SAPIR   ( 7 ) SIMPLIFICATION OF CONSONANTS.     Here are grouped together
a number of consonantal simplifications or partial losses of charac-
teristic quality, found chiefly in sentence phonetics.
   (a) Simplification of affricatives. A final -ts- ( < -tri-) or, less
often, -tc'f is sometimes reduced to -<·, -<·' before a word beginning
with a dental (f, n), less frequently before a word beginning with a
labial, e. g.:
""Uni'rjuts· then                             %ni'rjut- nontsi'k-up'iya' then flew
                                                 off; iini'ijut·' maya'iacu   then

                                                 (< i'tcf tTqa 'q-A)
     An internal -ist- is sometimes reduced to -t ri-, -tn- before η (see §
3, 2 , C ) :wiHsi't smi my great-grandchild                wi'Uit-v,(n)l
na' a'ints tsmiA like a girl                 na'a'ints tnniA
     (b) Assimilation      of -R to n-.     This happens only rarely, e. g.:
yu'un αΒ.(ϊ)          my leg                  yu'un an nantsi'n'aijqix i    come
                                                and joint my leg
   (c) Loss of labialization. Before an u or ο of the following word
a final -qw-, -yw-, -yw- is apt to lose its w (cf. simplification of wo < wa
after back-palatal stops to a; § 3,1, c). Examples are:
-raijw(a-) we                                'ivw'i'rat) iiru'yuts· let us then
-qw(a-)    it                                aija""q• uvmai' who is it then?
pina'Tjqw(a-) soon                           pina'r/q V "" soon so
   Final -x w sometimes melts with following qw- to -q-w- (cf. § 8, 1,
g), e. g.:
i{y)t't-ux-WA qwau* hither off               i(y)it-uq   wau'
  ( 8 ) ASSIMILATION OF SIBILANTS.      When two successive syllables
contain sibilants of different articulation (s, ts: c, tc; see § 12, 2, h),

             SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE                            55assimilation generally results either to the s- or c- position.              The
following types of sibilant assimilation have been observed.
  (a) Assimilation of s—c to s—-s. This seems to be rare. An
example is Asi'-saywa- LIGHT BLUE (contrast -ica- of qwica- τ ο
SPAHK).  (b) Assimilation of s—tc to c—tc. This also is not common. A
good example is cdcu- NAIL < sitcu- < *situ- (cf. Kawaiisu -cito-).
   (c) Assimilation     of ts—c to tc—c or ts—s.      Generally ts—s appears,
e. g.:
-tsi-c u-,-ts -cu-    (§ 35; § 19, 2, k)   -tsis u-, -tssu-:   pika'xit-

-tsi(-ts)-campa-     (§ 19, 2, j)          tiv^i'ts sampA    truly
   Yet tc—c also seems to occur, e. g. sari'tcicum            ONLY MY DOG       <
sari'tsi-cu-.
   (d) Assimilation of tc—s to tc—c. This uncommon type is il-
lustrated, e. g., in tca 'c L%ani MENSTRUAL HUT (for more normal
-as-1- contrast as ia - SURFACE).
  (e) Assimilation of ts—tc to tc—tc (ts—ts).      The normal tc—tc
assimilation, which occurs very frequently, is illustrated in:
-tsi- noun suffix + -tcu'a- inter-         a'ipatcitcu'""    a boy?
   rogative
-tsi- + -tcu- to make                      naya-'tcitcuqwayumpa,'     will turn
                                              (them)selves into rats

                                             ridge
  T h e less frequent assimilation to ts—ts is probably regular when
the primary ts is initial, e. g. ts -tsa'yki'a- ΤΟ CARRY ON A POLE (tsi-
WITH THE POINT, § 21, 9). Moreover, subordinating -tsi- (§ 55, 1, a),
unlike diminutive -tsi- or nominal -tsi- (cf. above examples), seems
regularly to maintain itself and to assimilate following tc to ts, e. g.:
ψιι'-tsi- having so done, then +           ifni'tsitsayWA   then we
   -tcar/wa- we

(lit., M O U N T A I N - L Y I N G P E O P L E , P L A T E A U P E O P L E ) . When the ts is
final, however, assimilated tc—tc                   seems to be not uncommon, e. g.

"             § 16.     Treatment of Consonants in        Composition.
   A word must begin with either a vowel (which may be preceded
by ') or one of the following nine consonants: p, t, q (k), qw (kw),
tc (ts), c (s), m, n, ' . When these consonants, by the processes of
derivation and composition, take u p a medial position and are im-
mediately preceded by a vowel, voiced or unvoiced, they assume, in
part, one of three distinct forms. These are summarized in tabular
form:
Initial              Spirantizcd             Geminatcd             Nasalized
p-                   -V-                     -v-                   -mp-
t-                   -r-(-tc-,-ntc-)         -t-                   -nt- (rarely -ntc-)
q- (k-)              -7-                     -q - (-k-)            -vi- (-Φ-)
qw- (kw-)            -yw-                    -q w- (-k w-)         -T)qw- (-ijkw-)
tc- (ts-)            -tc-, -ntc- (-ts-,      -t c- (-t s-)         -ntc- (-nts-)
                        -nts-)
c- (s-)                                      -C- (-S-)
m-                   -yw-                    -m-                   (-»»"")

Paiute itself, has no spirantal development; for m and η there is no
distinction between nasalization and gemination.
   T w o factors are operative in the determination of the form that
a consonant takes in medial position. In the first place, certain
elements (suffixes and enclitics) always appear with consistently
spirantized, geminated, or nasalized consonant, regardless of the
stem or morphological element that precedes; e. g. -γα- durative
suffix, -q u- numeral objective suffix, -ijqi- indirective suffix το, FOE.
On the other hand, all stems and many suffixes appear in either two
or, more often, three forms according to the nature of the preceding
stem or suffix. T h e initial consonants of suffixes that appear in two
distinct forms are either spirantized or, less frequently, nasalized;
e . g . f u t u r e -va n ta- ( a s i n ivi'va   n ia- WILL D R I N K , -q ava n ia- S E V E R A L
WILL — )       a n d -mpania-           ( a s i n ivi'ijumpania-       WILL T A K E A D R I N K ,
ivi'm-impa n ia- WILL BE WONT TO DRINK). AS a rule, the nasaliza-
tion in this class of elements is due to the presence of a nasal in the
preceding syllable. Much more typical is threefold alternation,
which affects all stems and many suffixes. Here the deciding factor
is the nature of the preceding stem or suffix, which, as far as a descrip-
tive analysis of Paiute is concerned, must be credited, as part of
its inner form, with an inherent spirantizing, geminating, or nasalizing
power (respectively indicated, where necessary, as               and - n ).
Thus, the same adjectival verb suffix appears in spirantal form in
arjqa'-ya- τ ο BE RED, geminated in qu'tca'-qa- τ ο BE GRAY, and
nasalized in pai'-rjqa- τ ο BE SMOOTH; the stems may be respectively
indicated as ayqa-', qut ca-"", pai-n.     On the other hand, the element
-ya-, -qa-, -rjqa- is consistently spirantizing (schematic form -qa-'),
e. g. in participial ayqaya-ri-, qu'tca'q a-fi-, pai'yqa-fi-. T h e particip-
ial -ri- is itself capable of appearing in geminated (-tΪ-) and nasalized
(-nt'i-) form as well under the appropriate circumstances (e. g. -ai-t'i-
NOT HAVING, NUxqwi'-nti- STREAMING). Thus, for purposes of deriva-
tion and composition one needs to know always whether a given stem
or suffix is one that spirantizes, geminates, or nasalizes. As to the
historical background of these processes, Paiute itself reveals com-
paratively little. A thorough study of comparative Shoshonean
linguistics would probably make them historically intelligible.","[80, 81]"
