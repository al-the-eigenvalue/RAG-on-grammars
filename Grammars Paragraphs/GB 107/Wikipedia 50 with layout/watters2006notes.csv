–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    It also becomes more clear under negation that the distinction between realis and
irrealis is, in fact, not related to “real” and “not real,” but is more closely related to
“actual” and “possible.” Thus realis affirmative statements assert something to be
factual, and irrealis affirmative statements assert something to be possibly true. In the
negative, “realis” asserts as true that something did not happen (or is not happening),
while irrealis asserts that even possible truth is not likely to become fact.","[71, 72]"
"5.5.4.1.    Negative realis in Class II verbs
     Negative realis-assertion is marked by a suffix -aÚu, with pharyngealization on the
first vowel and falling–rising pitch on the full sequence.2 6 (See also §6.1.2.2 Negative
existential.)
     As in the affirmative, the affixation type of person markers (i.e. prefixing or suffixing)
affects other affixation patterns as well. Thus, recall from (153–155) that with fully
contrastive prefixed person markers in the affirmative (Class I verbs) the only distinction
marked by suffixes is the number distinction. The suffix -du, then, marks singular
actant for first, second, and third persons, while -dak marks plural actants. In Class II
verbs -d is separated off as a first person marker.
     In Class II negative verbs, too, -d (along with -n and -g) belongs to the person
marking system and not to the negative suffix. Note, too, that in the negative there is no
marking in the verb to distinguish between singular and plural actants. Such information
is signalled by the free pronoun. Following is a Class II negative–realis paradigm:
    (184)      CLASS II — NEGATIVE–REALIS:

                  I give-1-NEG                    ‘I did not give.’

                  he/she give-3-NEG               ‘He/she did not give.’5.5.4.2.    Negative realis in Class I verbs
    As already alluded to, Class I verbs mark negative realis in all persons with the
suffix -daÚu. In Class II verbs, of course, we have already seen repeatedly that -d is a
person marker – first person negative is -d-aÚu, second person is -n-aÚu, and third
person is -g-aÚu. In Class I verbs, the -d has become part of the negative suffix.
Following is a Class I negative–realis paradigm:    26
        This suggests that the original sequence is something like -a)u, which interestingly, is
precisely the mutated form of -˙go, the imperative marker. Recall that the mutated form is related to
several marked structures – something also true of negation. (See §5.5.3.1 on Mutation.)

"    • Nasal consonant harmony with uvular consonants. In a process of anticipatory
assimilation, the alveolar nasal consonant in the sequence [na] is realized as a palatal
consonant [¯a] wherever the following consonant is uvular, as in the following:
    (72)     a.   [gi¯aq]            ‘trousers’
             b.   [¯aqtsin]          ‘I wait.’
             c.   [¯a an]            ‘You will go.’
             d.   [¯aˆ an]           ‘You sat.’
             e.   [¯~aˆ di]1 3       ‘wife’
             f.   [¯~aˆ gitse]       ‘daughter’
             g.   [¯~aˆ dzi]         ‘You look.’     • Establishing underlying [)] in contexts where it is “compressed”. There are
several constructions in Kusunda in which an underlying [ ] can be posited based on
the two principles discussed immediately above – pharyngealization (plus lowered pitch)
and consonantal harmony. The negative construction is one such context. Uvular [ ] is
compressed to such an extent in these kinds of high frequency environments that only
its secondary (concomitant) phonetic features are perceptible.
     In the first pair below we give the affirmative forms for ‘I went,’ and ‘You went.’ In
the second pair are the negative forms:
    (73)     a. [ts˙g˙n]           ‘I went.’
             b. [n˙g˙n]            ‘You went.’
    (74)     a. [t aÚ u]      <    [t a u]        ‘I did not go.’
             b. [¯aÚ u]       <    [¯a u]         ‘You did not go.’
    In (74a) and (74b), the sequence [aÚ u] comes from an underlying [a u], as evidenced
by pharyngealization on the vowel preceding [ ]. Evidence for underlying [ ] is further
supported by the change from [ts] and [n] affirmative to [t ] and [¯] negative in (74a–b).",[41]
"10.1.1     Negation in sequential chains
    One consequence of having finite marking on both verbs is their logical independence
of one another. Under negation, it appears (tentatively, at least) that the scope of the
negative applies only to the negated verb, something not necessarily true for classical
clause chaining languages. In classical clause chaining languages, negation on the final
verb can extend backwards to the medial verb as well, as in the following example from
Kham (Watters 2002:327):
   (343)      m˙d˙ cæokoraÚ o-d˙           ta-s˙-m~ï:h-si-c-yo
              wine beer         drink-NF PROH-CAUS-drunk-DETRANS-2P-IMP
              ‘Don’t get yourselves drunk drinking beer and wine!’
    The inference is that you should not drink and get drunk – drinking is also prohibited.
However, cause and effect must be semantically well integrated before the scope of
negation on the final verb extends back to include the medial verb. Unfortunately, our
corpus of data does not include examples of negative clause chains where the two events
can be thought of as semantically well integrated, and under such circumstances it is
impossible to know if the scope of the negative in semantically integrated events is more
inclusive than it is in semantically discontinuous events.",[126]
"6.1.2.1      Existence
    It is important to distinguish in Kusunda the difference between “existence in a
location” and “location.” The former expresses that something exists in a given
location, like ‘In the tree is a monkey,’ whereas the latter focuses on the actual location
of a given referent, as in ‘The monkey is in the tree.’ The existential copula is used
primarily to express the former – existence in a location. Pure existence, as in any
language, is rare in Kusunda:
    (231)      a. tsi-˙i      tsu
                  my-father exist
                  ‘My father is’ / ‘My father is living’ / ‘I have a father.’
               b. wu     tsi-˙i       tsu
                  home my-father exist
                  ‘My father is (at) home.’
               c. yi-g˙ ha o           tsu
                  tree-IN monkey exist
                  ‘In the tree is a monkey’ / ‘There is a monkey in the tree.’
               d. tu       dukæu tsu
                  snake two        exist
                  ‘There are two snakes.’
                  (tsi would mean ‘Two snakes are there’ / ‘There are two snakes there’)6.1.2.2      Negative existential
    The negative existential is kæaÚu. We noted earlier (see the discussion following
example (74) and §5.5.4.1) that the actual negative sequence is -aÚu, with pharyngealization
on the first vowel and falling-rising pitch on the full sequence. This suggests that the
original negative sequence is something like -a)u, with kh-a)u as the negative existential.
This leaves kh- as the negative existential verb root, a suppletive form with no apparent
relationship to tsu. Following are examples:
    (232)      a. ta≥     tsu
                  water exist
                  ‘There is water.’
               a. ta≥     kæ-aÚ u           < kæ-a     u
                  water neg.exist-not
                  ‘There is no water.’
                                              87

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––6.1.2.3    Possession
    As reflected in the glosses in (231a) pure existence is rare, and used in conjunction
with possessive clauses, the interpretation is one of possession – ‘I have a father’
(though the literal translation is ‘My father is’). Following are examples of typical
possessive clauses:
   (233)     a. tsi-h~ukui dahat tsu
                my-small three exist
                ‘I have three children.’ (lit. ‘my little ones three exist’)
             b. nu-ma     ˙si         tsu?
                you-WITH how.many exist
                ‘How many do you have?’ (lit. ‘with you how many exist?’)
             c. tsi-ma    qasti tsu
                I-WITH one exist
                ‘I have one.’ (lit. ‘with me one exists’)
    Negative possession uses the same negative existential verb that we saw earlier –
kæaÚu. Following is an example:
   (234)     tsi-h~ukui qasti b˙        kæaÚ u
             my-little   one even is.not
             ‘I don’t have even one child.’6.1.2.4    Dative subject constructions
    In “dative subject constructions” feelings/emotions/pain are construed as existing
‘to’ a referent, as in ‘Hunger is to me.’ In terms of syntax, the construction is similar to
the possessive clause construction, the major difference being in the marking of the
topical argument – ‘with me’ in possessive clauses, and ‘to me’ in dative clauses.
   (235)     t˙n-da    ida≥         tsu
             me-DAT hunger exist
             ‘I am hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is to me’)
   The negative uses the same existential negative kæaÚu that we saw earlier:
   (236)     t˙n-da     ida≥        kæaÚ u
             me-DAT hunger is.not
             ‘I am not hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is not to me’)6.1.2.5    Predicate adjective
    The “predicate adjective” construction – ‘He is tall,’ ‘I am big,’ etc. – predicates
adjectival notions through the help of the existential copula tsu, as in:
   (237)     a. na pæurlu≥ tsu
                this red       is
                ‘This is red.’
             b. tsi-h~ukui li≥wa tsu
                my-small heavy is
                ‘My child is heavy.’                                            88
                                       Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    The negative uses the same existential negative kæaÚu we saw earlier:
               c. tsi-h~ukui li≥wa kæaÚ u
                  my-small heavy is.not
                  ‘My child is not heavy.’
               d. ben amba ola≥ kæaÚ u
                  raw meat tasty is.not
                  ‘Raw meat is not tasty.’
   The predicate adjective construction is also used to predicate attributes designated by
“participles” (here partially-finite adnominals), as in the following:
    (238)      a. suta    bæ˙ra-q-ßn      tsu
                  string break-AC-REAL is
                  ‘The string is broken.’
               b. k˙re k˙la-q-ßn           lan tsu
                  pot break-AC-REAL like is
                  ‘The pot is about to break.’ (lit. ‘is like it will break’)
    As shown in (228a), the adjective can occur also without the copula, in which case it
is interpreted as a nominal in an equative clause – ‘I am a small person.’ (See also
(230).)6.1.3       Locational copula
    The locational copula is used to predicate the location of a referent – it is in such and
such a place. It differs from the existential copula, in that the latter expresses that the
referent exists, whether explicitly in a place or not.
    The locational copula is tsi in the positive and kæaÚi in the negative. Recall that the
negative existential was kæaÚu. Contrasting kæaÚu with kæaÚi we have further evidence
that the sequences were originally tri-morphemic – kæ-a)-u versus kæ-a)-i. Following
are examples:
    (239)      POSITIVE:
               a. tsi tsi
                  I loc.copula                      ‘I am (here).’
               b. tsi t˙isa     tsi
                  I here        loc.copula          ‘I am here.’
               c. nu tsi?
                  you loc.copula                    ‘Are you (there)?’
               d. nu isna         tsi?
                  you there       loc.copula        ‘Are you there?’
    (240)      NEGATIVE:
               a. ha o     yi-g˙         kæaÚ i
                  monkey tree-LOC loc.neg
                  ‘The monkey is not (located) in the tree.’
                                               89
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Basic clause types
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––               b. gina     kæaÚ i
                  he/she loc.neg
                  ‘He is not (there).’
    Notice that sentences (239a) and (239b) are very nearly synonymous, as are (239c)
and (239d). What is implied in sentence (a) and (c) is made explicit by a locative adverb
in (b) and (d). Notice, too, how this copula contrasts with the existential copula.
Following are contrastive examples:
    (241)      a. EXISTENTIAL:
                  yi-g˙       ha o      tsu
                  tree-LOC monkey exist
                  ‘In the tree is a monkey.’ / ‘There is a monkey in the tree.’
               b. LOCATIONAL:
                  ha o    yi-g˙       tsi
                  monkey tree-LOC loc.copula
                  ‘The monkey is in the tree.’
    In §5.2.2.4, example (124), we saw that in possessive clauses marked by the comitative
-ma ‘with,’ both existential and locational locatives can be used felicitously. Where the
existential is used the assertion is concerned with the existence of the item; where the
locational is used the assertion is concerned with the location of the item:
    (242)      a. EXISTENTIAL POSSESSIVE:
                  tsi-ma gimi     tsu
                  I-WITH money exist
                  ‘I have some money on me.’ (lit. ‘money exists with me.’)
               b. LOCATIONAL POSSESSIVE:
                  tsi-ma gimi      tsi
                  I-WITH money loc.copula
                  ‘I have money.’ (lit. ‘money is located with me.’)6.1.4       The inchoative and the causative
    The inchoative and the causative are treated here as subtypes of copular constructions
because 1) they serve frequently as verbs in “light verb” constructions (i.e. where the
real predication is done by a nominal and the verb is semantically empty), 2) they have
an intransitive–transitive paradigmatic relationship to one another, and 3) they form the
basis for verbal conjugation in “non-inflecting verbs” (see §5.5.1.2). Following are
some light verb constructions, all transitive, and all of which utilize the verb ‘to do,’ as in
the following:
    (243)      a. p˙idzi bun˙       ˙-g-˙n
                  cloth    weave do-3-REAL
                  ‘She is weaving cloth.’ (lit. ‘does weaving’)
               b. tap       gimi     gwa ˙-g-˙n
                  chicken female egg do-3-REAL
                  ‘The hen layed an egg.’ (lit. ‘did an egg’)                                               90

                I drum         do-1-PAST
                ‘I beat the drum.’
    There is some question about whether there is a phonological distinction between the
inchoative ‘become’ and the causative ‘make.’ Under careful articulation we recorded
distinct paradigms, but on the following day our informants would often give either
interpretation for either paradigm. There may be a single ambi-transitive verb with the
interpretation based on pragmatics. It is difficult to say at this stage. Nevertheless, we
give here two separate paradigms:

    We have a few sentences in our corpus in which there is a clear distinction between
“inchoative” and “causative” roots:
   (245)     tsi mo≥ ˙-d-u                   s˙h˙r a-d-u
             I king become-1-IRR:SG city            make-1-IRR:SG
             ‘I will become king and I will make a city.’
    The status of the inchoative realis is confusing, with what appears to be a lot of
variation, and we can say nothing substantive about it.
    As we have shown earlier (see §5.5.1.2), Class II transitive conjugations are patterned
after the “causative” paradigm, i.e. based on the auxiliary verb ‘to do, make,’ as in the
following contrastive examples (‘do’ marks the Class II auxiliary verb root):

                ‘I carried it.’                    ‘I cooked it.’
    Where the verb root ends in a consonant, (246b), or in a vowel radically different
from the first vowel [a] of the causative root ‘make,’ (246c), the causative root surfaces
unscathed – a-t-ßn [make-1-REAL]. Where the verb root ends in [˙] or [a], the two vowels
tend to coalesce, as in (246d).
    We have a few examples in which the inchoative version of the verb root [˙-] can be
used in a kind of “passive” sense, but this is almost expecting too much of the
distinction between [˙] and [a] where the distinction is almost non-existent elsewhere.
The construction is rare in our corpus and needs more research. Following are examples:
   (247)     a. tsya d˙baq ˙-g-u
                tea later      be-3-IRR:SG

                he    tea later       cook make-3-IRR:SG
                ‘He/she will cook tea later.’
    The difference between the verb in (247b) hul˙ ˙-g-u and its active counterpart in
(247c) hul˙ a-g-u is so minimal that the contrast may depend more on contrastive syntax
than anything else – the “passive” version is without an agent.","[87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"

   Both medial and final verbs sometimes employ a second negative. Though we can
surmise on the origin of its structure, we do not know how this negative differs semantically
from the one illustrated in §10.1.1 above. We give two examples of a medial verb
negated by this second negative (a–b), and one example of a final verb (c):
    (347)      a. gina po≈la kæaÚ i              g-˙m-˙n
                  he    bathe be:REAL:NEG 3-eat-REAL
                  ‘He didn’t bathe and he ate.’ (He ate without bathing.)

                  ‘He didn’t come home and he slept on the trail.’ OR
                  ‘Not coming home, he slept on the trail.’
               c. gimi       meÚ-d-i     d~aba-n˙ kæaÚ i
                  money lose-1-PAST, find-2          be:REAL:NEG
                  ‘I lost the money and you didn’t find it.’
    Beginning with (347a), the expected negative form for a finite, realis Class II verb
would be po≈la-g-aÚi (bathe-3-REAL:NEG), the -g being a third person agreement marker.
The negative kæaÚi, on the other hand, is the negative existential copula, now used as
negation marker on non-copular verbs. (See Negative existential under §6.1.2.1.) The
use of copular verbs in modality systems, of course, is widespread in the languages of
the world, South Asia included. This is the first instance, however, that we have seen it
in Kusunda.
    In §8.1.4 we saw examples of bare verb roots used in concatenative structures like
hol t-˙m-du (cook 1-eat-IRR:SG) ‘I’ll cook and eat.’ The first root, hol, is followed by a
second finite root, t-˙m-du, without intervening morphology of any kind. The negative
construction that we are dealing with here is a parallel structure – the negative copula
follows the bare root. It is reasonable that such “bare root” verbs should be negated by
the existential, without all the finite machinery of conjugated verbs.
    The form of the final verb in (347c) is also unexpected. We would expect d~aba-n-aÚi
(find-2-REAL:NEG). Final verbs are always finite, being marked for TAM and person/num-                                            127

the first root. It is very likely, in fact, that the grammaticalization pathway for d~aba-n-aÚi
is < *d~aba-n˙ kæaÚi.
    It may turn out, then, after further study, that the “concatenative” structure is the
“real” clause chaining device and the structures illustrated in (342) are coordinated
“co-ranking” structures on the English model.","[126, 127, 128]"
"5.5.4.3.    Negative realis in mutating verbs
    All mutating verbs belong to Class I, i.e. person marking indices are prefixed to the
verb root. (But not all Class I verbs are mutating.) Significantly, negative realis in
mutating verbs employs mutation as part of its marking strategy, and the negative suffix
-u is added to the mutated root. Thus, both irrealis and negative are marked/mutated
patterns.
    (186)      a. REALIS            b. IRREALIS              c. NEGATIVE
                  n-˙g-˙n              ¯-a -an                  ¯-a -u > [¯-aÚ -u]
                  2-go:REAL-IND        2-go:IRR-IND             2-go:IRR-NEG
                  ‘You went.’          ‘You are going.’         ‘You did not go.’
    Here we encounter a few clues about the composition of the more elaborate negative
suffixes. The most basic (and probably original) negative marker is a simple -u suffix
added to the marked form of a mutating verb – yielding -a)-u (as in 187a, c) and
phonetically yielding [-aÚ -u]. (See also Negative indefinite pronouns under §5.1.3.)
    Next, in Class II verbs, the slightly elongated form -aÚu follows person markers
yielding sequences like -d-aÚu for first person, -n-aÚu for second person, and -g-aÚu
for third person. Finally, in non-mutating Class I verbs, the modern realis negative
marker includes -d as part of the negative sequence – -daÚu for all persons (as in
185a–f). Mutation is part of the history of negation and occurs in both the simple and
in the more elaborated forms of the morpheme.2 7
    Following is a negative–realis paradigm for mutating verbs (illustrating the simplest
of the negative suffixes):

"6.1.1.1         Negative equative
   The negative equative copula is odoq, which can occur virtually anywhere the zero
copula occurs. The negative of (226b) and (226d), for example, is as follows:
       (227)      a. na gimi       tsi-yi odoq
                     this money I-GEN is.not
                     ‘This money is not mine.’
                                              85

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––             b. na tsi kila-d-ßn        gimi      odoq
                this I steal-1-REAL money is.not
                ‘This is not money that I stole.’
    We have recorded a few cases in which the equative copula (Ø or odoq) occurs with
adjectives, an environment in which one might expect the “predicate adjective” copula.
Of course, the predicate adjective copula does occur in this environment (as in na
pæurlu≥ tsu ‘This is red’; see example (237a) below), but where the equative occurs, the
implication is that one particular item is chosen from among many as having the relevant
feature – ‘This one is long’ or ‘This is the long one.’ In effect, the adjective is rendered
as a nominal. This is similar to what occurs in Nepali and other languages of the region,
like Kham. In Kusunda, however, because the positive construction is verbless, it is
more difficult to determine the correct interpretation in that context:
   (228)     a. na li≥wa Ø
                this heavy (copula)
                ‘This one is heavy’ / ‘This is the heavy one.’
             b. na l˙≥ka odoq
                this long is.not
                ‘This one is not long’ / ‘This is not the long one.’
    There is still a possibility that we have interpreted (228a) incorrectly. Perhaps
adjectives are “verbal” enough in their semantics that they can be used as simple
predicators, in which case (228a) should be interpreted to mean ‘This is heavy.’ Given,
however, that the negative equative is possible here, we are assuming that the adjective in
the verbless construction, too, is functioning as a nominal.","[85, 86]"
"5.5.4.      Negation
    There are two negation patterns – one for realis and another for irrealis. In Class II
verbs the distinction between past and realis is neutralized in the negative, i.e. past does
not have a negation pattern distinct from realis. This lends support to our earlier
hypothesis that realis and irrealis are the original and basic distinctions in Kusunda,
while past is a later development.",[71]
"6.1.2       Existential copula
   The existential copula is tsu in the positive and kæaÚu in the negative. It does not
conjugate for person, number, or for tense (that we are aware of), although there are
some limited aspectual notions supported by it. The same copulas (positive and negative)
used for existential senses are also used in predicate adjective constructions.",[87]
"9.2.1         Implicative causative – “make”
    The implicative causative is a complement verb structure whose matrix verb is the
verb ‘to make.’ The embedded verb is coded in much the same way as the clauses we
saw in §8.1 and §8.2 – either as “neutral” or finite (or as a mutating structure as we
saw in §8.4). There is, however, none of the -da encoding we saw on “purposive”
clauses. Following are neutral forms:

                  ‘I got my friend to fight.’
    The following embedded forms are finite, realis mode. We do not seem to have any
examples of the embedded form in past tense. Whether it is possible or not needs to be
verified.
    (325)      a. t˙n-da   wi      a-t-ßn     ˙-g-i

                  ‘I made him dance.’
    In an unexpected twist, the embedded form of “mutating” verbs (see §5.5.3.1) is
the irrealis form, something that needs to be accounted for (we broached this topic first
in §8.4). In Class II verbs, like the verb in (325a), the form of the embedded verb is
realis (which is what one would expect for an implicative verb). Irrealis would seem to
imply a non-implicative status for the embedded verb.
    Earlier (see fn. 25, 26), we noted that the mutating pattern very likely originated in an
old “marked–unmarked” distinction and was later morphologized in various systems.
The marked modality is irrealis, the marked polarity is negative, and here, the marked
dependency is dependent. In the “permissive” construction (see §9.3.4) we will see the
pattern again.

     The “send causative” uses, as its matrix verb, a transitive verb which means ‘send’
in its literal sense. The embedding structure, however, is something we have not yet
encountered, and will not properly discuss until §10.1, and specifically in §10.2.5. We
introduce it here simply as an “overlapping converb.” Following are two examples:
    (327)      a. gina t˙n-da      wi       a-de     t˙mb˙-g-u

                    ‘You got him to build a house.’
    The causative use of ‘send’ contrasts with the literal sense of ‘send’ through the
complementation type used. With literal ‘send,’ the complement is cast as a “purposive”
clause, as in:
      (328)      tsi gin-da       am-da     t˙mb˙-d-i
                 I    him-ACC eat-PURP      send-1-PAST
                 ‘I sent him to eat.’
    This latter sense of ‘send’ is non-implicative; it does not imply that the event named
by the embedded verb occurred.","[118, 119, 120]"
"5.5.7.2.    Optative
    • Optative in Class I verbs. The optative, especially in Class I verbs, has a paradigmatic
relationship to the imperative. The negative imperative (the prohibitive), for example,
employs the second person prefix n-, whereas the optative (either the negative, positive,
or both) employs the third person prefix g-. Apart from this simple generalization, the
paradigm is very irregular. Following are examples:
    (212)                             PROHIBITIVE            OPTATIVE

              c.   ‘die’              n-o -˙n                g-o -ya

              g.   ‘see’              ˘-~aÚ-yin              g-~aˆ -na
    Notice here, too, that Class I verbs, whether transitive or intransitive, follow similar
conjugational patterns. Class II verbs, mostly transitive, are the ones that diverge.
    There are also negative optatives in our data set (as in ‘Let him not go’), but
generally they are so confused and incomplete that we will not attempt to present them
here, except to say that some of them appear to take the prohibitive suffix -in, and others
the irrealis negative suffix -wa:

   Our data is insufficient to make any predictions, but it is interesting to note that
negative -wa occurs only in the absence of third person g-. Wherever g- occurs, the
negative suffix used is the prohibitive -in.",[81]

3.      Linguistic type
     Kusunda is related to no other language or language family of South Asia; indeed,
as far as we can tell, to no other language on earth – it is a true linguistic “isolate”.
There are, to be sure, a few lexical borrowings from surrounding languages, both from
Indo-Aryan and from Tibeto-Burman. But all such borrowings are relatively recent and
have nothing to do with its genetic lineage.
     The status of some linguistic isolates can be extremely difficult to determine; such
languages may have been sufficiently influenced through long-term contact with
surrounding languages that they begin to resemble them both grammatically and lexically.
The original language provides only a substrate. Kusunda has not escaped at least some
such influence, but, by and large, it remains a typological isolate – i.e. it is phonologically,
lexically, and grammatically distinct. Thus, we can be reasonably safe in assuming that
throughout most of its history Kusunda developed in isolation, and only in recent times
has it had contact with other linguistic types.
     Phonologically, Kusunda possesses sounds that do not exist in other languages of
the region – namely, uvular and pharyngealized consonants. Conversely, there are
sounds found throughout the region, like retroflex consonants, that do not occur in
Kusunda. Furthermore, the point of articulation in Kusunda is more-or-less immaterial,
it is the active articulator that counts as contrastive.
     The uvular consonants are accompanied by the concomitant features of pharyngeal
stricture and lower fundamental frequencies on preceding vowels. Such features, in fact,
are often the primary auditory cues to their presence.
     The voicing contrast in Kusunda is neutralized in many consonants, having a lesser
functional load than in surrounding languages.
     Vowels in Kusunda occur partially in harmonic sets, an upper set comprising three
vowels and a lower set comprising three vowels. There is considerable free variation
between the two sets, and only in a few words can opposing vowels in upper and lower
sets be shown to be contrastive. This suggests that Kusunda may have at one time had a
simple, three vowel system – i, a, o.
     Consonant sounds in Kusunda occur at many points of articulation – bilabial, dental,
alveolar, palatal, retroflex, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal. Most of the points,
however, are non-contrastive, and there can sometimes be considerable variation even in
single words. What is more material for Kusunda, then, is to describe consonant
sounds in terms of their active articulator – labial, apical, laminal, velar, and uvular/pha-
ryngeal. An apical consonant, for example, can be dental, alveolar, or retroflex.
     One of the most striking and unusual aspects of Kusunda grammar is the means by
which “marked” structures are distinguished from “unmarked” ones. The “mark” is
not an affix, as typical of the region or indeed of the languages of the world, but rather, a
harmonic autosegmental process (which we will refer to as “mutation”) that spreads
“retraction” across the entire word. Apical consonants become laminal, velar consonants
become uvular, and vowels from the upper set shift to the lower set. The process
appears to be very old, and occurs today only in a very small subset of high frequency
verbs.
     Vestiges of this striking morphophonological process are still apparent in several
categories and may represent the morphologization of a single process in different
contexts – all ‘marked’ categories. Thus, the marked modality is irrealis (while the
unmarked category is realis); the marked polarity is negative; the marked transitivity is
                                              20

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––causative; and the marked dependency is dependent. All of these systems utilize mutation
as a mark (at least to a partial extent).
    There are very few case marking affixes in Kusunda, but an affix -da occurs as a
distinguishing morpheme in numerous systems. In some cases a single etymological
source can be plausibly inferred – -da is a local case marker, the marker of an animate
object in transitive clauses, and occurs in some complement clauses. In other cases,
different morphemes that just happen to be homophonous must be assumed – -da is a
plural number agreement in verbs, a marker of incompletive aspect, and a morphological
causative.
    Syntax in Kusunda follows a basic SV, AOV constituent order, with alternative
orders used to mark specialized pragmatic notions. This is common in the linguistic
area. Subject NPs are often deleted in running discourse, the person and number of the
subject actant being recoverable from obligatory person–number agreement markers in
the verb. In terms of grammatical case marking, Kusunda follows a nominative–accusative
case marking alignment – something unusual for the languages of the region.
    Verbs in Kusunda divide broadly into Class I and Class II. In Class I verbs, person
agreement is marked by prefixes and number by suffixes, whereas in Class II verbs both
person agreement and number is marked by suffixes. Class I verbs are old with a lot of
irregularity in the paradigms and an abundance of suppletive forms. The majority of
verbs belong to Class II. Such verbs can be thought of as “non-inflecting,” i.e. all
inflection falls on an auxiliary based on the verb ‘to make, to do.’ Class II intransitive
verbs are basically bereft of person marking, with a new, innovative person marking
distinction developing in some contexts.
    The basic TAM system in Kusunda makes a binary distinction between realis and
irrealis. Class II verbs have also developed a past tense distinction, a distinction that is
generally missing from Class I verbs.
    There are derivational operations in Kusunda whereby inherently intransitive verbs
can be made transitive, and inherently transitive verbs made intransitive – the latter a kind
of “middle” derivation. Both operations are morphological, and causativization always
yields a Class II verb. Periphrastic causatives are also possible, in which case the caused
event is embedded to the causativizing matrix verb ‘to make, to do.’
    Verb subordination (or embedding) occurs in numerous Kusunda structures – relative
clauses, verbal complements, periphrastic causatives, and applicatives. A striking feature
in Kusunda, unusual for the typology of the region, is that such embedded structures
appear not to be nominalized (although our so-called ‘neutral’ verbs are possible candidates
for nominalization; see §8.1 and §9.1.2). Most subordinate structures are fully finite
and their embedded status is signalled entirely by their syntax. (In mutating verbs,
subordination is also marked by mutation.)
    Some, but not all, clause chains in Kusunda are marked by converbs. Unusual,
however, is that converbs in Kusunda do not mark sequential events, but “overlapping”
ones. Sequential chains are marked by a series of fully finite verbs. Certain periphrastic
causatives, as well as some complements (like ‘teaching how to do something’) are
marked by overlapping converbs. A structure which on the surface looks deceptively
like the benefactive in surrounding languages, is, in fact, only an overlapping converbal
structure. The benefactive, at least for some non-inflecting (Class II) verbs, is marked
by the auxiliary ‘give’ in place of the auxiliary ‘make, do.’ In most cases, however, it
requires no derivational machinery and is formed simply by the addition of a dative
argument.","[19, 20, 21]"

                 ‘You [pl] did not go.’

                 he/she go-IRR-NEG
                 ‘He/she did not go.’
    Unlike the non-mutating verbs, here we see a distinction between the singular and
plural forms of the negative – distinct plural forms occur in (187b) and (187d). Parsing
the forms, however, is far from transparent. From (141) we saw that the plural forms for
‘go’ involve a vowel change in the verb root from ˙ to i. We also saw from (150–152)
that plurality is regularly marked by -da. In (187b) and (187d) both processes occur –
thus -id- is glossed as ‘go:PL’.
    Note, too, that the negative in third person uses an -i suffix in place of the -u suffix.
The negative -i occurs also in other persons, but it seems to be more prevalent in third
person contexts. We do not know if there is an implied semantic distinction between -i
and -u. This problem will require more study. One possibility that suggests itself is
that -i and -u are somehow related to the existential and locative copulas (see §6.1).
There may be evidential distinctions here.","[73, 74]"
"5.5.4.4.    Negative irrealis
    Negative irrealis-assertion is marked by a suffix -wa, as in (188) and (189) below.
This -wa is very likely related to the negative -u discussed immediately above. Negative
irrealis-assertions can arise either from low probability or, in the case of first person,
from refusal, as in the following examples:
    (188)     CLASS I:
              a. tsi ts-ip-wa
                 I 1-sleep-NEG:IRR
                 ‘I won’t sleep.’
              b. tsi t-˙m-wa
                 I 1-eat-NEG:IRR
                 ‘I won’t eat it.’
    (189)     CLASS II:
              a. tsi a-d-u-wa
                 I make-1-IRR-NEG
                 ‘I won’t make it.’                                             74
                                       Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––               b. nu a-n-u-wa
                  you make-2-IRR-NEG
                  ‘You won’t make it.’
     It should be mentioned that the irrealis negative morpheme -wa is often contracted to
-u, sometimes giving rise to potential ambiguities, as in:
    (190)      a. tsi t-ug-u             b. tsi t-ug-u       < t-ug-wa
                  I 1-come-IRR              I 1-come-NEG:IRR
                  ‘I will go.’              ‘I won’t go.’
   There is also a possibility that -wa is a bimorphemic sequence (< *-u-a), with -u the
negative, and -a some, as yet, undiscovered morpheme. Recall that historically *-u has
been posited as the negative morpheme in (187) (see the discussion surrounding those
examples).","[74, 75]"
"   • Refusal. Negatives with a strong component of “refusal” sometimes mark the
pronoun twice on the verb – the old prefixed form and a newer suffixed form, as in:
    (191)      tsi t-˙m-wa-tsi
               I 1-eat-NEG:IRR-1
               ‘I won’t eat it.’5.5.4.5.     Negative perfect
   Another aspectual category is the negative perfect, translated as ‘not yet.’ It is
formed by suffixing a pronominal copy at the end of the realis negative verb, as in:
    (192)      a. tsi t-˙m-daÚ u-tsi
                  I 1-eat-REAL:NEG-1S
                  ‘I haven’t eaten yet.’
               b. tok t-˙m-daÚ u-tok
                  we 1-eat-REAL:NEG-1P
                  ‘We haven’t eaten yet.’
               c. nu n-˙m-daÚ u-nu
                  you 2-eat-REAL:NEG-2S
                  ‘You haven’t eaten yet.’
    The same construction can also convey a sense of negative habitual:
    (193)      numba amba t-˙m-daÚ u-tok
               cow     meat 1-eat-REAL:NEG-1P
               ‘We don’t eat cow meat.’5.5.5.      Imperatives
   There are a large number of irregular, suppletive forms for marking the imperative,
especially in old, high frequency verbs (e.g. see (197)), and each has to be learned
separately. Still, most verbs follow regular patterns and we will deal with those first.",[75]

"   • Negative indefinite pronouns. Negative indefinite pronouns are derived from the
more basic interrogative pronouns seen in the preceding section. The “nobody, nothing,
nowhere” series, for example, uses the interrogative pronoun plus an existential negative.
The pattern is pervasive in South Asia and often appears with an emphatic marker on the
question word as well, as in IA Nepali ke-hi chhaina [what-EMP is.not] ‘nothing,’ or TB
Kham su-z˙ male [who- EMP is.not] ‘no one.’ Though it occurs without an emphatic in
Kusunda, its basic form is the same, as the following examples show:
    (104)      a. n˙tßn kæaÚ u tsim˙n-gya
                  what not        touch-OPT
                  ‘Nothing will happen, let him touch it!’
               b. n˙tßn qæaiya kæaÚ u
                  what danger not
                  ‘There is no danger.’
               c. n˙ti kæaÚ i
                  who not
                  ‘no one’
               d. hampe kæaÚ u
                  where not
                  ‘nowhere’        The finals -ti and -ßn may be old classifier morphemes and occur in other sequences like qas-ti
    19‘one’ and qas-ßn ‘one’.",[48]
"6.1.1.2    An equative copula
   There is an equative copula b˙t, which is in some ways the positive counterpart of the
negative equative described above. However, the copula b˙t occurs only rarely, and there
may be pragmatic constraints on its use. Following are examples:
   (229)     a. tsi b˙t
                I    equative
                ‘It’s me.’
             b. tsi mo≥ b˙t
                I king equative
                ‘I am the king.’
             c. ta    hol-di      amba        b˙t
                this cook-ADJ meat            equative
                ‘This is cooked meat.’
    Note that in (229b) the implication is similar to what we described for (228a) – the
referent is singled out from among many – ‘I am the one who is king,’ not just ‘I am a
king.’ Likewise, the equative copula b˙t can also occur with adjectives, in which case the
adjective functions as a nominal:
   (230)     tsi h~ukui     b˙t
             I    small     equative
             ‘I am a small/unimportant (person).’ / Not *I am small.
                                            86

2.       A socio-linguistic and anthropological profile
    According to the 2001 Census of Nepal, 164 people in Nepal call themselves Kusunda,
87 of whom are reported to speak the Kusunda language. Though we have no independent
figures on which to dispute this number, all indications by the speakers themselves
would put the estimate much lower – perhaps as few as seven or eight speakers. Prof.
Sant Bahadur Gurung, too, Vice-Chairman of NFDIN, reports that although they have
conducted extensive searches for Kusundas in the past few years, they have managed to
locate no more than twenty-eight, only four or five of whom are speakers (person
communication).
    Kamala Khatri, our most fluent informant, reports that her mother is fully fluent,
barely speaking Nepali. She is now too old to travel. Kamala’s cousin-sister, Gyani
Maiya, is also a speaker, and their mama, Prem Bahadur, can be rated only as a
“semi-speaker,” capable of generating no more than the most rudimentary sentences.
Gyani Maiya reports that three of her younger brothers speak fluent Kusunda, but she
has had no contact with any of them for more than thirty years. As far as Kamala,
Gyani Maiya, and Prem Bahadur know, these seven kins-people are the only speakers in
the “Dang–Rolpa group.” It is probable that there are no surviving speakers in the
“Surkhet group,” Reinhard’s informant being the last, and Raja Mama is likely the last
surviving semi-speaker in the “Gorkha–Tanahu group.”
    All seven speakers in the Dang–Rolpa group are only recently removed from a
hunter-gatherer existence in the jungles. They are currently settled in villages where the
only means of communication is through Nepali. Prem Bahadur was born in the jungle
near Hapur, Pyuthan, as was Gyani Maiya and her three brothers. They still recall
subsisting in the jungle on wild roots and hunted animals, but even during their childhood
their band was small and splintered. When they reached marriageable age, there were no
eligible Kusundas around, forcing them to marry outside their caste. Prem Bahadur and
Gyani Maiya married Nepali-speaking Magars, and Gyani Maiya’s three younger brothers
married Kham-speaking Magar women from the village of Bhalkot, in the western
extreme of Baglung district.4 Gyani Maiya’s sister, reportedly also a Kusunda speaker,
lives in the same village.
    Cross-tribal marriage is one of the major contributors to the death of the Kusunda
language. Communication between spouses must be conducted in a common language,
usually Nepali, and children grow up (at best) with only a passive understanding of a
few words in Kusunda, but speaking only Nepali or Kham. Deeper causes, of course,
contribute to the necessity of inter-tribal marriage – overpopulation among the general
populace, the destruction of vast tracts of forest land, and the resultant splintering of
earlier self-sufficient, self-propagating hunting bands being some of the major ones.","[12, 13]"
"    • The comitative. The comitative marks a notion of association, or doing an action
with another actant, as in the following:
   (123)     gina-ma     tsi ts-˙g-˙n
             he-WITH I       1-go-REAL
             ‘I went with him.’
   As in most other languages of the region, the comitative also marks possession, as in
‘With me is one rupee’ meaning ‘I have one rupee.’
   (124)     tsi-ma    qasti tsi/tsu
             I-WITH one is
             ‘I have one.’ (lit. ‘with me is one’)
    The language is ambivalent in how it interprets -ma. As a location, it collocates with
the locational copula tsi. As a possessive, it collocates with the existential copula tsu.
    In “reciprocal” kinds of verbs, -ma marks the reciprocal actant. Such verbs, mor-
phologically, behave like intransitives, as in:
   (125)     tsi gina-ma       limu-tsi-n
             I     he-WITH     fight-1-REAL
             ‘I fought with him.’
   There is at least one bitransitive verb in Kusunda in which -ma marks the “source.”
                                           55
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––The verb is ‘beg,’ as in:
       (126)   tsi-ma   gimi     ai-dzi       d-˙g-˙i
               I-WITH money beg-3:PAST 3-go-PAST
               ‘He begged money from me and left.’ (lit. ‘with me’)    • The “benefactive”. What we refer to here as the “benefactive” is a case marker
that occurs on NPs without concomitant valence adjusting modifications on the verb.
For details on the latter kind of benefactive construction, see §10.2.3. Here, the benefactive
case marker is based on the Nepali ko lagi, as in the following:
       (127)   tsi-lage limu-dzi
               I-FOR fight-3:PAST
               ‘He fought for me.’    • Comparative. The comparative in Kusunda is based on the Nepali bæ˙nda, as in
the following:
       (128)   na bæ˙nda ~oˆ ˙n o -da-n
               this than       big     come-PL-REAL
               ‘Bigger than this come.’ (in reference to mosquitos)    • Instrumental. It seems strange that we have been unable to elicit an instrumental
marker. All attempts have yielded nothing. Reinhard and Toba list a morpheme -ya as
the instrumental. Following is an example of the lack of an instrumental:
       (129)   na kæurpa-Ø kis˙-g-˙n
               this knife         cut-3-REAL
               ‘This is cut by a knife.’ / ‘(He) cut this with a knife.’
    (See §8.1 for the “neutral” conjugation of this verb – something that yields an
intransitive reading.)5.3.       Locative postpositions
    Most locative postpositions are specialized nouns that specify some kind of location
– notions like ‘on top of,’ ‘beside,’ etc. Some have referred to such nouns as “relator
nouns” (Starosta 1985; Watters 2002). Where these nouns still function elsewhere in
the grammar as full nouns with their original, literal sense, their nominal source is
transparent. In other cases, the word ceases to function as a full noun, and serves only
in a locative function.
    A transparent case of a noun serving as a postposition is the word for ‘behind,’
s˙mba derived from s˙mba ‘buttocks.’ (See fn. 21.) The word has a temporal function,
too, meaning ‘after’ or ‘later.’
    That many such words are basically nouns can be shown by the fact that they are
capable of supporting the genitive or the locative case marking suffixes shown in §5.2.2.
Thus, for example, a~o ‘inside’ and b~adza ‘outside’ can take the ablative in the same way
that ‘house’ can take the ablative. Thus, we can get:
       (130)   a. a~o-˙na      b~adza   ˙g-a
                  inside-ABL outside come-IMP
                  ‘Come out from the inside!’                                              56

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––             b. wi-yi          b~adza
                house-GEN outside
                ‘outside the house’ / ‘the house’s outside’
    Other words that are probably nouns, though we do not have enough data to prove it,
are the following:
   (131)     a.   gidzaq         ‘between’
             b.   kampya         ‘to one side’
             c.   pinda          ‘in front of’
             d.   a k˙           ‘on top of, above’ (see the spectogram under §4.3.2)
    The last word, (131d), also occurs in our elicitation lists as the noun for ‘sky.’
Again, we are dealing with a noun that has become grammaticalized as a locational
postposition. Likewise, pinda in (131c) can be used to mean ‘first,’ as in pinda duksi
‘the first/eldest son.’
    We have two lexemes for ‘down, below, or under,’ and another two for ‘up, or
above.’ We have nothing to indicate what the difference might be. The words are:
   (132)     a. aqa              ‘down, below, under’
             b. ama a            ‘down, below, under’
   (133)     a. n~oˆ dze         ‘up, above’
             b. a~ ˆ dze         ‘up, above’
   Another three locational nouns are the following:
   (134)     a. akp˙i            ‘across’
             b. asne             ‘uphill’
             c. paÚtse           ‘downhill’    • Deictic pronouns/locatives. There may be a three-way deictic distinction – prox-
imate, distal, remote – in the Kusunda deictic locatives, but we have been unable to verify
this.
    There are two sets, one for static location and another for “direction to.” The three
forms in each set do not form regular paradigms, the individual members being suppletive.
The forms ape ‘there,’ tape ‘to there,’ and sape ‘to here’ may have formed a paradigm
at one time in the language, but in the modern language the forms are semantically
disparate. The modern paradigms are as follows (it is not known how (135b) and
(135c) differ):
   (135)     STATIC:
             a. t˙isa            ‘here’
             b. ape              ‘there’
             c. nupa             ‘there’
   The locatives in (135) occur with verbs like ‘sit’ or ‘sleep’ in constructions like ‘Sit
here!’ or ‘Sleep there!’
   (136)     DYNAMIC:
             a. tape             ‘to here’
             b. t˙wa             ‘to here’
             c. sape             ‘to there’                                              57

   The locatives in (136) occur with verbs that include motion – like ‘Come here!’ or
‘Go there!’ or even ‘Give it here!’ We have examples of both tape and t˙wa occurring
with the command ‘Come here!’5.4.    Adjectives
    Like Indo-Aryan, but unlike Tibeto-Burman, Kusunda has a distinct “adjective”
class. That is, the property notions of “size,” “shape,” “color,” etc., form an inherent
class of words not derived from other word classes (as with the class of stative verbs in
TB). This does not mean, of course, that the class of adjectives in Kusunda matches the
class of adjectives in any other language. There are several words that occur as adjectives
in English, for example, that occur as verbs in Kusunda. ‘Fat,’ for example, is a verb in
Kusunda, but an adjective in English. (See also §9.1.4 for derived Adjectivals.)
    Adjectives in Kusunda, when occurring in a modifying function, precede the noun
they modify, and in a predicative function they occur with the existential copula tsu (or
kæaÚu, its negative counterpart). Following are examples:
   (137)     MODIFICATION:
             a. huigin ta≥       pokæla-yin
                dirty   water bathe-PROH
                ‘Don’t bathe in dirty water!’
             b. tsi ˙gi tu          ts-~aˆ -dzi
                I    live snake 1-see-PAST
                ‘I saw a live snake.’
             c. h~ukun suta      bæ˙ra-q-ßn
                small thread break-AC-REAL
                ‘The small thread broke.’
   (138)     PREDICATION:
             a. na    amba ola≥ tsu
                this meat tasty is
                ‘This meat is tasty.’
             b. tsi gya ai tsu, gina-ma           limu-tsi-n
                I    strong     am, he-WITH fight-1-REAL
                ‘I am strong, I fought with him.’
             c. nu ta       kam     ˙n wey˙n kæaÚ u
                you this work do good              not
                ‘It’s not good for you to do this work.’
    We spent very little time studying adjectives, and may encounter surprises in a later
study. One thing that did catch our attention was the paucity of basic color terms –
black, white, and red. Even the simplest TB systems have a four-term system – black,
white, red, and green. Still, black, white, and red are the colors predicted by Berlin and
Kay’s (1969) study for a three-term system.
    Yellow and green are also possible in Kusunda, but only as secondary innovations.
Yellow, as in some of the TB languages of the region,2 3 is based on the color of tumeric
powder. The Kusunda word for tumeric is k˙p˙≥, and ‘yellow’ is k˙p˙≥ b˙yo. The

contexts.
    Our informants, for several weeks, claimed that Kusunda had no word for ‘green.’
Eventually, they produced the word h˙rgun, which appears to be related to Nepali
h˙riyo. The likelihood of this being true is more convincing in the light of a second
word for ‘red’ – kæ˙rgun – based on a Kham corruption of the Nepali word for ‘rust.’
In Kham the word for ‘reddish-brown’ is kæ˙iryaso ‘rust-like.’ The words h˙r-gun and
kæ˙r-gun, then, may mean something like ‘har-like’ (from Nepali ‘green’) and ‘kæ˙r-like’
(from Kham ‘reddish-brown’). The words for ‘black’ and ‘white’ respectively are
soksodi ~ soksog˙r˙m and kasige.
    The Kusunda word for ‘bad’ stands out as unique in the languages of the region.
In both IA and TB, ‘bad’ is commonly expressed only as NEG-good. In Kusunda,
‘bad’ qolom is a separate lexical item from ‘good’ wey˙n.
    Most verbs, too, can be used in a modifying function. For a treatment of these, see
§9.1 on Adnominals and relative clauses.","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59]"
"5.5.2.2.   Class II person and number marking
    In Class II irrealis mode, the sequences -d-u (157a) and -d-˙k (157b) may appear
superficially to be equivalent to the -du (153a–155a) and -da-k (153b–155b) of Class I
verbs. In fact, however, the Class I and Class II forms are composed of different
morpheme sequences (clearly as a consequence of reanalysis due to person suffixation
in Class II – see also summary in (166–167)):

     The Class II -d-u / -d-˙k forms are in paradigmatic opposition to second person -n-u
/ -n-˙k and third person -g-u / -g-˙k, as in:

    Likewise, the realis forms also distinguish between -d ‘first person,’ -n ‘second
person,’ and -g ‘third person,’ as in:
    (160)     FIRST PERSON
              a. pumba-d-ßn
                 beat-1-REAL              ‘I beat (someone).’

                  beat-3-REAL             ‘He/she/they beat (someone).’
    Class II verbs also have a past tense. As is true for irrealis and realis modes, so too
in past tense the suffixes -d, -n, and -g mark first, second, and third person, respectively.
Following is the paradigm:
    (163)     FIRST PERSON
              a. pumba-d-i
                 beat-1-SG:PAST           ‘I beat (someone).’
              b. pumba-d-ei
                 beat-1-PL:PAST           ‘We beat (someone).’
    (164)     SECOND PERSON
              a. pumba-n-i
                 beat-2-SG:PAST           ‘You beat (someone).’
              b. pumba-n-ei
                 beat-2-PL:PAST           ‘You [pl] beat (someone).’
    (165)     THIRD PERSON
              a. pumba-(g)-i
                 beat-3-SG:PAST           ‘He/she beat (someone).’
              b. pumba-(g)-ei
                 beat-3-PL:PAST           ‘They beat (someone).’
    Thus, in Class I verbs, where person markers are prefixed, the sequences -da and -du
are indivisible, single morphemes – -da functions as a plural marker and -du as a
singular irrealis marker. In Class II verbs, -da and -du are forced to coalesce with
suffixed person markers -d, -n, and -g, resulting in a reinterpretation of the data. The
-du of Class I becomes the -d-u, -n-u, and -g-u of Class II; the -da-n of Class I becomes
the -d-˙n, -n-˙n, and -g-˙n of Class II; and, finally, the -da-k of Class I becomes the
-d-˙k, -n-˙k, and -g-˙k of Class II.

    For most verbs in Kusunda there is, what appears to be, a three-way tense distinction
– past, present, and future. By contrast, and central to our understanding of the three-way
distinction, however, Class I verbs have only a two-way distinction. Past and present
time are generally grouped together into a “realis” mode, and its opposite, “irrealis,”
marks future time and possibility. Realis, in some cases, however, can also occur with
future events, especially where certainty is high; such events are “perceptually located in
the real world” (Elliott 2000). Elliott claims that this is the case for a number of
Australian languages; “tense does not necessarily reflect reality status” (Elliott 2000:68).
    Evidence suggests that the realis–irrealis distinction is older and more primary than
the so-called a “past–present–future” distinction. In fact, past tense (see Table 3)
appears to be only an added category; it occupies some of the same semantic space as
realis (see §5.5.4 on Negation) and, more significantly, its absence does not constitute a
“present” tense (indicated by the “strike through” in Table 3). Rather, the absence of
“past” is only realis. The major difference between past and realis is that past has an
unequivocal past–completive reading, while realis is used more frequently in utterances
with a kind of “neutral” or “timeless” sense, as in the verb ‘build’ in the following
sentences:
    (168)      a. pyana        tsi wi          a-t-ßn,          t˙~îna   ts-ip-du
                  yesterday I        house build-1-REAL, today           1-sleep-IRR
                  ‘Yesterday I built a house, today I will sleep.’                                             66

                 yesterday     I      house build-1-PAST, today 1-sleep-IRR
                 ‘Yesterday I built (finished) a house, today I will sleep.’
    Past–present–future in Kusunda, then, is only the fiction of a three-way division.
The real distinction is past–realis–irrealis. Thus, in Table 3, Class I verbs are those with
a two-way distinction, and Class II verbs add a further distinction for a total of three.

   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  Table 3. TWO-WAY CLASS I DISTINCTION, AND THREE-WAY CLASS II DISTINCTION    From Table 3 we see that both verb classes mark future and unrealized (irrealis)
events with -u / -k, and realis events with -n. Class II verbs, in addition, mark past
completive events with -i (singular) or -ei (plural).
    The realis form is partially compatible with future time adverbials, although not in
independent utterances as in (169a). It can be used, however, with future time adverbials
in what appears to be a kind of neutral, timeless sense, as in (169b):
   (169)      a. *goraq      tsi ts-˙g-˙n
                 *tomorrow I      1-go-REAL
                 *‘I went tomorrow.’
              b. t˙~în   wi       a-t-ßn,        goraq      ts-ip-ßn
                 today house 1-make-REAL, tomorrow 1-sleep-REAL
                 ‘Today I build a house, tomorrow I sleep.’
    Irrealis, on the other hand, is fully compatible with future time. Thus, it can occur
with future time adverbials, or with present time adverbials extendable to a future reading,
as in the following:
   (170)      a. goraq     tsi t -a -an
                 tomorrow I      1-go-IRR
                 ‘Tomorrow I will go.’
              b. d˙baq tsi t -a -an
                 now      I   1-go-IRR
                 ‘I will go now.’ (‘I haven’t started yet, but I’m ready to go.’)
    Irrealis is not compatible with past time, (unless it occurs with incompletive -da, in
which case it carries a sense of ‘would have’ or ‘was about to’ – see §5.5.3.6). Its
incompatibility with past time adverbials is illustrated in the following example:
   (171)      *pyana        tsi t -a -an
              *yesterday I 1-go-IRR
              *‘Yesterday I will go.’                                            67

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––5.5.3.1.    Mutation
    In a small subset of Class I verbs (high frequency verbs like ‘go’ and ‘come’) a
process of “mutation,” is used in marking the realis–irrealis distinction.2 5 Apparently,
the process is old; it is being replaced by a newer and more regular affixation pattern.
For “mutating” verbs, then, there are two equivalent irrealis forms – those marked by
mutation (172b, 173b, and 175) and those marked by -k (176).
    Beginning with the realis conjugation as the default, all consonants and vowels used
for the irrealis form are “shifted” back one point of articulation – apical becomes
laminal, velar becomes uvular, ˙ becomes a, and u becomes o (see fn. 25). In such cases
the irrealis morpheme is a kind of autosegmental harmony process which spreads across
the whole of the root affecting all consonants and vowels. Following are examples:

               a. REALIS

    In contrast to the mutating Class I verbs, the realis–irrealis distinction in the majority
of Class I verbs is marked by affixation patterns. Following are examples of irrealis
forms marked by the affixes -du (for singular) and -dak (for plural):
    (174)      REALIS                                   IRREALIS
               a. t-˙m-˙n                               t-˙m-du
                  1-eat-SG:REAL                         1-eat-SG:IRR
                  ‘I ate.’                              ‘I will eat.’
    25
        Whatever the original function of ‘mutation’ may have been, it shows evidence of having later
been morphologized to operate in several grammatical systems, not restricted to the realis–irrealis
distinction alone. In some transitivity diathesis alternations, for example, the marked parameter is
marked by mutation, as in: dzu≥-dzi ‘It hangs’ vs. mutated dzoˆ-a-dzi ‘He hung it.’ See also sections
§8.4, §9.2.1, §9.3.4, and §9.3.8 for the ‘mutating’ pattern in subordination.
        Though such marking systems are rare in the languages of the world, similar phenomena have
been reported in isolated cases. Jim Watters (1987) reports that in Tlachichilco Tepehua, a Totonacan
language of Mexico, second person subject agreement in verbs is marked by glottalizing all glottalizable
consonants – p, t, ts, ch, k, and q become p’, t’, ts’, ch’, k’, and , respectively.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68]"

Acknowledgments
    No one could have guessed, early in 2004, that before the year was out we would get
lucky with Kusunda. At the time, all we had were a couple of word lists, one from the
1850s and another from the 1970s; plus a short text that was largely uninterpretable.
We knew almost nothing about the grammar – doubly lamentable in light of the fact that
Kusunda was recognized as a language isolate, related to no other language on earth. In
some quarters, the last speaker was reported to have died in 1985, and though some
Nepalese linguists and anthropologists were aware of one or two Kusundas with a vague
memory of their ancestral tongue, the situation was not hopeful, and most of us had
resigned ourselves to the notion that we would never know more about Kusunda than
what we already knew.
    In the midst of this unpromising circumstance, our friends at the National Foundation
for the Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN), especially Vice-Chairman
Prof. Sant Bahadur Gurung and Member Secretary Mr. Tamla Ukyab, never gave up. It
is impossible to overemphasize our indebtedness to them. In April 2004, with help from
the National Indigenous Nationalities Women’s Forum, they brought three Kusundas to
Kathmandu from Dang Valley to help them with citizenship papers – a practical, first
step in helping them and making a simple thing like land ownership a possibility for
them. They also arranged a press conference in which they introduced the Kusundas to
the public and to the academic community – sociologists, anthropologists, and linguists.
It was there that we discovered that one of them, Ms. Gyani Maiya Sen, had more than a
passive knowledge of Kusunda; she could actually speak it!
    We, at the Central Department of Linguistics (CDL), Tribhuvan University, immediately
made a proposal to Prof. Gurung and Mr. Ukyab to help us in bringing Gyani Maiya
and possibly other Kusunda speakers into Kathmandu for a three month period of
intensive linguistic research. Their response was magnanimous. Not only did NFDIN
agree to fund the research and documentation project, they also sent one of their own
people, Mr. Dinesh Gurung, to Dang to bring the speakers to Kathmandu.
    Once in Kathmandu, Mr. Jagat Gurung, also of NFDIN, dealt with many practical
arrangements, like finding lodging for the Kusundas and taking them on weekend tours
to the zoo and to numerous religious sites. We are grateful for his willing contribution.
We are also grateful to Mr. Stephen Watters, of SIL and CDL, for making digital
recordings of many Kusunda sounds, and to Dinesh Khadga of Kantipur Photo Studio
for making video recordings of several elicitation sessions. All electronic media are now
housed at the CDL library, and make a valuable addition to their language archives.
    Without question, our greatest debt of gratitude goes to the Kusunda speakers who
accepted the invitation to come to Kathmandu – Ms. Gyani Maiya Sen, Ms. Kamala
Singh Khatri, and Mr. Prem Bahadur Shahi Thakuri. Back in Dang, Gyani Maiya
contacted Prem Bahadur, her uncle, and Prem Bahadur contacted Kamala, his niece, who
lived in Rolpa. Only Gyani Maiya had been to Kathmandu before, at the recent invitation
of NFDIN. But for all of them, a three month stay in Kathmandu was a leap of faith.
They were at the mercy of strangers, not knowing fully what to expect. When they
arrived, they quickly settled into their new situation, cheerfully sharing their language
and their lives.
    Four of us at CDL, Linguistics Chair Prof. Yogendra Prasad Yadava, Prof. Madhav
Prasad Pokharel, Mr. Balaram Prasain, and myself, had separate, daily sessions with our
new-found friends, keeping them busy the whole day long. Once a week, we debriefed
                                           5

of the linguistics department. I should make clear that the three participants do not
necessarily agree with all my interpretations presented in this grammar. Any and all
errors are my own.
    At the end of the research period, NFDIN hosted another press conference, at which
the Kusundas were fêted, and the principal investigators were given opportunity to
present their findings. An invited speaker, State Minister for Local Development Mr.
Krishna Gopal Shrestha, promised his support for projects aimed at uplifting indigenous
nationalities. Several other dignitaries, including Prof. Sant Bahadur Gurung, Prof.
Yogendra Prasad Yadava, Prof. Madhav Prasad Pokharel, Prof. Novel Kishore Rai, and
visiting Prof. Sueyoshi Toba, gave unanimous voice to the overriding value of language
documentation and preservation efforts. The conference was reported in all the major
Nepalese dailies for Asoj 24, 2061, BS (October 10, 2004).
    A special note of thanks goes to Professors R. M. W. Dixon and Alexandra Aikhenvald
for inviting me as an Honorary Visiting Fellow to their Research Centre for Linguistic
Typology (RCLT) at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. I was able to spend
three months, uninterrupted, analyzing my notes and writing the present grammar. I was
also given opportunity to present my findings and analysis at an RCLT seminar, receiving
valuable suggestions and comments from Robert Dixon, Alexandra Aikhenvald, Randy
LaPolla, John Saeed, Gerrold Sadock, Ghil‘ad Zuckermann, and John Hajek.
    I would also like to thank Alexandra Aikhenvald, Scott DeLancey, David Bradley,
Sueyoshi Toba, and Stephen Watters for reading an earlier draft of this grammar and
making valuable comments. I have not incorporated all of them, and any shortcomings
are my own.
    Last, but not least, I wish to thank the Himalayan Linguistics anonymous reviewer
who took a close, critical view of the first edition of this grammar (the NFDIN version)
and made a number of very helpful suggestions. Many of those recommendations I
have followed and incorporated into this current edition.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"
"8.4       Embedded structures marked by mutation
    We have noted already that mutation is a grammatical “mark” in Kusunda. (See
§5.5.3.1, §5.5.4.3, and fn. 25.) Here we see that the mark applies not only to the marked
member of the realis–irrealis dichotomy, but also the marked member of the indepen-
dent–subordinate dichotomy. In the following examples, the mutated variants of n˙g˙n
and ts˙g˙n do not indicate irrealis, but subordination:
      (308)   a. n˙n-da      ¯-a -an e-g-i
                 you-ACC 2-go-SUBORD give-3-PAST
                 ‘He let you go.’
              b. t˙n-da   wi-g˙      t -a -an ˙-g-i
                 me-ACC house-LOC 1-go-SUBORD make-3-PAST
                 ‘He made me go home.’

9.       Syntax of subordinate strucutures
    In this section we will look at individual grammatical categories – periphrastic causatives,
relative clauses, various complements, etc. – and explore the different ways in which they
can be encoded. Most have a one-to-many relationship, i.e. a single category can be
encoded in more than one way. In some cases, different encodings imply different
nuances of meaning, and in other cases we are unaware of any semantic differences.","[112, 113]"

1.      Introduction
    The Kusundas, also known as Ban Rajas “Kings of the Forest,” are an ethnic
group of Nepal who, until recent historical times, lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers
in central and midwestern Nepal. Nowadays, due to the loss of vast tracts of forest
lands their hunting bands have splintered and they have been compelled, because of a
lack of marriageable Kusunda partners, to intermarry with other ethnic groups. As a
result, their numbers have dwindled drastically and their language has all but ceased to
exist.
    Kusundas first came to the attention of the Western world in 1848 when Brian
Hodgson, the British Resident to the Court of Nepal, introduced them, together with the
Chepangs, in an article in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, On the Chépáng
and Kúsúnda tribes of Nepál, with the following words:
       Amid the dense forests of the central region of Népál, to the westward of the
       great valley, dwell, in scanty numbers and nearly in a state of nature, two broken
       tribes having no apparent affinity with the civilized races of that country, and
       seeming like fragments of an earlier population. (1848:650; 1874:45)
    His description is even less flattering a few sentences later when he goes on to say
that, “They have bows and arrows, of which the iron arrow-heads are procured from
their neighbors, but almost no other implement of civilization, and it is in the very skilful
snaring of the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air that all their little intelligence is
manifested.”
    Van Driem (2001) reports that according to Ralph Turner (1931), Kusunda was
formerly used as “a term of abuse for the so-called Rajputs of Nepal,” and may still be
used in the sense of “savage.” Reinhard, too (1976:2), notes that in some areas of
Nepal the word Kusunda makes reference to those who “do not listen to advice and
behave rudely.” In our own experience, the term still has some currency, especially in
western Nepal. Our informants, however, seemed either unaware or uncaring of its
pejorative overtones, and were quite happy to refer to themselves as Kusundas, although
they continue to refer to themselves by their autonym, mihaq ‘the people.’ (See §2.1,
paragraph 2 and fn. 5.)
    Nine years after his first mention of Kusunda, Hodgson, in his Comparative
Vocabulary of the Languages of the Broken Tribes of Nepal (1857), published a list of
Kusunda words, some 223 in all. Apparently the data was collected by linguistic
assistants, for in his own words he confessed that, “During a long residence in Népál, I
never could gain the least access to the Kusúndas, though aided by all the authority of
the Durbar” (part II, p. 46). The most important consequence of Hodgson’s list was
that it (should have) demonstrated unequivocally that Kusunda was unrelated to Chepang,
or for that matter, to any other language or language family of South Asia. (See
Appendix A for a full, modern vocabulary of about 850 words.) It seems that Robert
Shafer (1953) was the first to notice its unique status, almost one hundred years later.","[6, 7, 8, 9]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––5.1.4.      Demonstrative pronouns
    As far as we can tell, there are only two demonstrative pronouns in Kusunda – na
and ta. The distinction does not appear to be deictic, as in the usual “proximate” and
“distal” distinctions in both IA and TB languages of Nepal. Rather, the distinction
appears to be based on animacy, na being an animate demonstrative, and ta an inanimate
demonstrative. Here we repeat the examples in (101):
    (105)      a. n˙ti na
                  who this (animate)      ‘Who is this?’
               b. n˙ti ta
                  what this (inanimate)   ‘What is this?’
     Unfortunately, this generalization breaks down in many contexts, and the two terms
seem to be interchangeable, as in na pæurlu≥ tsu ‘This is red’ to refer to an inanimate
object. It is possible that na is the functionally unmarked member of the two.
     We are not aware of a way, using demonstrative pronouns, to distinguish between
‘this’ and ‘that.’ However, the third person pronoun sometimes occurs as a demonstrative,
and in that function appears to express a distal demonstrative ‘that’:
   (106)       gina k˙l˙m gina-yi
               that pen         he-GEN
               ‘That pen is his.’
    There are no plural demonstrative pronouns. Plurality in pronouns, like plurality in
nouns, can be marked in the NP by numerals or quantifiers, or by plural agreement
affixes in the verb. (See also §5.2.1.)5.2.     Nouns and noun morphology
    All nouns in Kusunda, as far as we currently know, have the same morphosyntactic
properties. The class is composed of prototypical nouns, concrete kinds of things that
can be manipulated and counted. Though they can be counted, none of them can be
pluralized. There is no nominal plural marker. This sets them apart from pronouns,
which we saw in §5.1.
    Another class of words that might be called “nominal” (though not so in this
grammar) are “action nouns.” This is a highly restricted class and occurs only in
constructions as a complement of the verb ‘to do’ – notions like ‘to do thinking’ or ‘to
do hitting.’ More than half of the verbs in Kusunda are formed from such elements.
Rather than referring to them as “nouns” in light verb constructions, however, we will
refer to them as “non-inflecting verbs.” They require the presence of an auxiliary verb
‘to do, make’ to carry the appropriate inflection. More investigation needs to be done
on their properties. (See §6.1.4.)
    In §5.2.2.3 we give some evidence, still weak, for a possible “locational” subclass
of nouns.","[48, 49]"
"6.1.1.         Equative clauses
     The equative clause is most commonly expressed without a copula (though, as we
shall see, an infrequently used equative copula does exist). The construction is formed
by the juxtaposition of two noun phrases (NPs) without grammatical case marking. The
first NP in the sequence is the copula subject and the final NP is the copula complement.
The order of the elements has grammatical implications – the subject is the presupposed,
topical element, and the complement functions as the predicator, as in the following:
       (226)      a. n˙ti na
                     what this
                     ‘What is this?’
                  b. na gimi       tsi-yi
                     this money I-GEN
                     ‘This money is mine.’
                  c. gina k˙l˙m n˙ti-ye
                     that pen       who-GEN
                     ‘That pen is whose?’
                  d. na tsi kila-d-ßn         gimi
                     this I    steal-1-REAL money
                     ‘This is money that I stole.’
                  e. nu m˙b˙-n-i          gip˙n n˙tßn
                     you hear-2-PAST talk         what
                     ‘What is the matter/talk you heard?’
    A reordering of elements in any of these equative clauses makes for a slight difference
in meaning. A reording of (226d), for example, yields tsi kila-d-ßn gimi = na [I steal- 1-REAL
money = this] ‘The money I stole is this,’ in which ‘this’ is the predicator.",[85]
"5.1.1.1.    Possessive prefixes
    In first and second persons singular, the same pronominal roots (tsi- and ni-) can
occur as pronominal prefixes on nouns, without the genitive. Where they do, they are
possessive prefixes, and differ from the possessive pronouns shown in (90) in much the
same way that ‘mine’ differs from ‘my’ in English. The “alienable–inalienable”
distinction found in some languages appears to be irrelevant for Kusunda. Following
are examples:
    (91)    a. tsi-gimi
               1SPOSS-money                ‘my money’
            b. ni-gimi
                 2SPOSS-money              ‘your money’                                                45
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    In first and second persons plural, the possessive root cannot occur as a possessive
prefix attached directly to nouns, but must be accompanied by the genitive. This is true
also for third person gina, as in:
    (92)    a. *tig-gimi
            b. tig-i       gimi
                1PPOSS-GEN money          ‘our money’
    (93)    a. *gina-gimi
            b. gina-yi gimi
               he-GEN money               ‘his money’
    First or second person singular possession can be marked by either form – the
prefixal form or the genitive marked form – though there are likely pragmatic differences
between the two. The following examples show them in free variation:
    (94)    a. tsi-gimi ~ tsi-yi gimi         ‘my money’
            b. ni-gimi ~ ni-yi gimi           ‘your money’
    The genitive occurs also on question words, as in:
    (95)        n˙ti-ye      gimi
                who-GEN      money            ‘whose money?’5.1.1.2.   Lexicalized third person possession
    There are several lexical items in the language in which an initial g- is very likely the
vestige of an old third person possessive prefix. Typically, such words come from the
domain of body parts (and may be restricted to a general “parts” domain). Thus, for
example, the default word for ‘stomach’ is gim˙t and the second person possessed
form, ‘your stomach,’ is ni-gim˙t. From this we might expect tsi-gim˙t for ‘my stomach,’
which, indeed is possible, but the preferred form is ts-im˙t.
    (96)    a. gim˙t            ‘stomach’
            b. ni-gim˙t         ‘your stomach’
            c. ts-im˙t          ‘my stomach’
    Interestingly, in Reinhard’s 1976 list, ‘stomach’ is listed as imat, without a prefix.
In contrast, ‘knee’ in Reinhard’s list is t-uputu with a prefix (likely meaning ‘my
knee’), while we have elicited upto.
    The word for ‘wind’ is qai, while the word for ‘breath’ is either ata qai ‘mouth
wind,’ or ge-qai ‘its wind.’
    (97)    a. qai                      ‘wind’
            b. ata qai                  ‘breath’ (lit. ‘mouth wind’)
            c. ge-qai, [gya-qai]        ‘breath’ (lit. ‘its wind’)
    A word that commonly occurs in combination with other words to mean something
like ‘fluid’ or ‘juice,’ is very likely the etymon for ‘water’ with a lexicalized third
person prefix, as in the following:
    (98)    a. ta≥                    ‘water’
            b. gida≥                  ‘sap’ (lit. ‘its water’)
            c. ata gida≥              ‘saliva’ (lit. ‘mouth water’)                                             46

             e. twi-yi gida≥             ‘honey’ (lit. ‘bee water’)
    Other candidates for a lexicalized third person prefix are the following:
    (99)     a.   gemehaq1 7             ‘Ban Raja’
             b.   gidza≥                 ‘body’
             c.   gidzi                  ‘name’ < ? *g-i-dzi ‘he says’
             d.   git˙t                  ‘skin’
             e.   gip˙n1 8               ‘word, language’
             f.   gisi                   ‘fat’
             g.   gitsi                  ‘thorn’5.1.2.      Oblique forms and the accusative
   First and second person pronouns have an oblique form that occurs with the accusative,
and third person has a slightly reduced form. Thus, taken together with the genitive
form, Kusunda has two “oblique” modifications of the pronoun, one for the genitive
and another for the accusative, as summarized in Table 2:

   The interrogative pronouns of Kusunda correspond to the so-called WH-words of
English and include the following seven:
    (100)      a.    n˙ti                  ‘who, what’
               b.    n˙n                   ‘what, why’
               c.    n˙tßn                 ‘what, why’
               d.    hampe                 ‘where’
               e.    ˙sa                   ‘how’
               f.    ˙si                   ‘how much’
               g.    ˙saÚ i                ‘when’
    The semantic domain of some of these interrogatives is not yet clear. ‘What,’ for
example, can be expressed by n˙ti, n˙n, or n˙tßn, all obviously related forms, but it is not
clear what their semantic differences are.1 9 Used with an animate demonstrative, n˙ti is    17
        The basic form for this word is mihaq ~ mehaq, and it is not clear to us what the function of
the prefix ge- might be.
        B. K. Rana (2002) claims similarity between this word and the Kham word ge-pa≥ ‘our
    18language.’ Granted, p˙n and pa≥ bear some similarity, the initial element in Kham is a first person
plural prefix, while in Kusunda it is a third person singular.","[45, 46, 47]"
"1.3.    Recent contact with Kusunda speakers
    Since the mid-1980s, a handful of Nepali scholars have been aware that one or two
isolated speakers of Kusunda could still be found, albeit speakers with imperfect retention
of their language – some with only vague memories of words used by their elders.
Perhaps a few things of significance could still be gleaned, but the prospects for fruitful
research did not seem good.
    In 1987, Hemanta Raj Bhandari, an ethno-botanist living near Swayambhu in
Kathmandu, wrote an article in the Nepali daily Gorkhapatra reporting that in his
fieldwork he had encountered several Kusunda families living in Gorkha, Damauli
(Tanahu), and Dang. Prof. Churamani Bandhu, a linguist at Tribhuvan University and
the Royal Nepal Academy, followed up on Bhandari’s leads and traveled to Gorkha and
Damauli the same year. He was disappointed in Gorkha, but in Damauli he was able to
meet two speakers – a man named Raja Mama and Raja Mama’s mother. He collected a
few words from the mother, “a fairly fluent speaker,” he recalls, but learned a couple of
years later that she was no longer alive.
    In 1989, Churamani Bandhu also traveled to Sahare village in Surkhet, this time in
                                            11
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Introduction

wife, not a speaker of Kusunda, and learned that the man he sought was no longer alive.
The next year in Dang valley, Bandhu learned of another speaker by the name of Prem
Bahadur Shahi Thakuri, then away from his village on seasonal work. A year later, in
1991, Prof. Bandhu returned to Dang with Prof. Madhav Pokharel, one of the contributors
to this grammar, and Prof. Ballabha Mani Dahal. This time they made contact with
Prem Bahadur and managed to collect a few new items of language.
    Madhav Pokharel, who had also met Raja Mama of Tanahu, reports that though
Prem Bahadur was the more proficient of the two speakers, even he was able to recall
only 67 items on the Swadesh 100-word list. Furthermore, he could only partially recall
the most rudimentary verbal paradigms, and was unable to form sentences of any
complexity. Though not entirely extinct, Kusunda was lacking its former vitality. Whole
systems were moribund, well beyond the reach of the memories of its last faltering
speakers.","[11, 12]"

                   ‘I roasted meat in the fire.’
                b. INTRANSITIVE:

                   fire-IN 1-go-REAL burn-1-REAL
                   ‘I went into the fire and got burned.’
    The intransitive version, illustrated in (280b), is passive in force and must be translated
in English as ‘got burned.’7.2.3.2       A “functional” passive
    In §8.1 we will discuss verbs that occur without person marking – our so-called
“neutral” inflection. In subordinate structures like the “purposive” clause, neutral
inflection on the subordinated verb indicates an identity of person (same subject) with
the matrix verb, as in the following:
      (281)     tok hyoq-ßn       ts-i-da-n
                we hide-NEUT 1-go-PL-REAL
                ‘We went to hide.’
   In Class I verbs, however, it is not normally possible to be rid of all person marking
– person marking occurs as a prefix. In such cases, the most neutral inflection is a
generic third person prefix (see §8.1.3), as in the following verb used in a modifying
function:
      (282)     g-˙m-˙n      kæaidzi
                3-eat-REAL food
                ‘eaten food’ / ‘food eaten by (someone)’
    In like manner, independent verbs in coordinate structures (see §11.1) can be interpreted
as having passive force where the medial “passive” verb is inflected as a generic third
person and the final verb is specific for person, as in:
      (283)     pyana       hul˙-g-˙n,      t˙~îna t-˙m-˙n
                yesterday cook-3-REAL, today 1-eat-REAL
                ‘Yesterday it was cooked, today I’ll eat it.’
   Many third person realis forms, pronounced as -˙g˙n by Gyani Maiya, are pronounced
simply as -˙n by Kamala, as in (284). (On this topic see also sections §4.4.4.1,
examples (63–64), and §9.1.2,1.)
      (284)     pyana       hul˙-n,      t˙~îna t-˙m-˙n
                yesterday cook-REAL, today 1-eat-REAL
                ‘Yesterday it was cooked, today I’ll eat it.’7.3       Reflexive
    The reflexive construction in Kusunda does not require detransitivizing morphology
in the verb, but relies on the reflexive pronoun gimdzi ‘self.’ The reciprocal uses the
same mechanism, but with two occurrences of the reflexive pronoun, as in:                                             104
                                       Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––   (285)     a. REFLEXIVE:
                gimdzi pæo-˙-g-˙n
                self     beat-TR-3-REAL
                ‘He hit himself.’
             b. RECIPROCAL:

                self     self     die-CAUS-TR-3-PAST
                ‘They killed each other.’
    This is not to say that detransitivized constructions are not compatible with the
reflexive pronoun; they are. If, however, the speaker wishes to express that the agent
acted on him/herself, the construction requires a fully transitive verb, as in the examples
of (285). Used with intransitive constructions, inherent or derived, the reflexive pronoun
only signifies that the eventuality named by the verb happened without outside agency
(not that it acted upon itself):
   (286)     ANTICAUSATIVE WITHOUT REFLEXIVE PRONOUN:
             a. gagri pæiru-t-ßn
                jug     fill-AC-REAL
                ‘The jug filled.’
             ANTICAUSATIVE WITH REFLEXIVE PRONOUN:

                jug    self       fill-AC-REAL
                ‘The jug filled on its own.’

                ‘I didn’t do it, the corn broke by itself.’
    The same reflexive pronoun is used to indicate exclusive ownership, in which case
the reflexive pronoun precedes the possessed item, as in:
   (287)     a. gina    gimdzi gimdzi wi-nu         t-ei-dzi
                he/she self      self    house-TO go-PL-TAM (?)
                ‘They each go to their own houses.’
             b. nu   ni-gimdzi wa        ¯-a -an
                you 2S-self       home 2-go-IRR
                ‘You will go to your own home.’
                                           105
8.         Morphology of subordinate structures
    Clauses which are subordinated or embedded in other structures – adnominals in
relative clauses, sentential complements, periphrastic causatives, purposive clauses and
the like – are cast in one of three basic construction types. In one, the verb is cast in a
“neutral” non-finite form without person marking; in another, the subordinated verb
root is marked by a suffix -da; and in a third type the subordinate verb is fully finite.
None of the structures appear to have any kind of nominalizing morphology, although it
might be argued that the presence of -da is sufficient evidence to assume some kind of
nominalization – -da is also an NP object marker (see §5.2.2.2).3 3
    Lack of nominalized structures makes Kusunda typologically exceptional. Languages
of the region, both Nepali and TB languages like Kham, nominalize all sorts of embedded
clauses, and in some TB languages there are multiple types of nominalization.
    Here we will explore the basic morphological structure of subordinate structures and
talk later (in §9) about how they function within hosting structures. Though presented
from different points of view, there will necessarily be some overlap.","[103, 104, 105, 106]"
"7.1       Causative
    There are a number of verbs in Kusunda that occur in alternating pairs, one member
of which is transitive and the other intransitive, with morphological rules for deriving one
from the other. In some cases the basic, unmarked form is intransitive, in which case the
transitive member is derived by a process of causativization. In other cases the base
form is transitive, and the intransitive member is derived by a process of anti-causativization.
The former process increases the valence of the verb and the latter decreases its valence.
    It is not immediately obvious from the general semantics of a verb whether its
inherent status will be transitive or intransitive. How such things are lexicalized is a
matter of cultural specific construal and depends in some way on whether the eventuality
named by the verb can be conceptualized as occurring without an agent. In Kusunda,
for example, the ‘break’ type verbs are inherently agentive and can be made intransitive
only by derivation. In Kham, the language which surrounds Kusunda on all sides is the
opposite – most events, even the ‘break’ type ones, are lexicalized as inherently spontaneous
intransitive events and are made transitive only by causativization.",[97]
"4.4.5.     Liquids, flaps, glides, etc.
   Kusunda has the liquid [l], the flap [r], and glides [y] and [w]. Following are
examples:
    (83)     LIQUID:
             a.   la an          ‘village’
             b.   ligin          ‘nettle, burlap’

             d.   dz˙g˙l         ‘old woman’

             d.   k~aw˙r         ‘light weight’
    Glides (semi-vowels) occur as non-peak elements in vocalic sequences belonging to
the same syllable, as in:
    (85)     GLIDES:
             a.   ye≥gu          ‘stone’

5.         Word classes
     The major word classes, noun, verb, and adjective are well represented in Kusunda.
We will deal with them one at a time in this section with a separate sub-section for
pronouns. We will also look at some minor word classes, like adverbs, numerals, and
question words. We were unable to determine the extent to which Kusunda makes use
of “ideophones” or “rhyming couplets” for modifying verbs. This is a category of
the type in which basic verbs like ‘go’ are modified by ideophonic adverbs to mean
things like ‘saunter,’ ‘stomp away,’ ‘go in long strides,’ etc. The phonomenon is well
represented in the region, both in Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman languages. The
category needs study in Kusunda; indeed, it has not yet been determined if it exists at
all.","[43, 44]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––Reinhard, an American anthropologist studying at the University of Vienna, found members
of the Kusunda tribe in Gorkha district, and then in Surkhet district a year later. He
collected a number of Kusunda words together with a short text narrated by Tek Bahadur,
and in 1970, with the help of Sueyoshi Toba, a Japanese linguist studying in Nepal, the
two co-authored an article – A Preliminary Linguistic Analysis and Vocabulary of the
Kusunda Language – published by the Summer Institute of Linguistics and Tribhuvan
University. Unfortunately, Toba had to work without the benefit of an informant, and
his transcriptions are based on what he could hear from Reinhard’s tape recordings. In
the text, too, many morphemes and their glosses are necessarily speculative with very
little to go on. Still, it was better than anything we had to date. Though the word list
differed in some respects from Hodgson’s list, the language was essentially the same.
     Reinhard published some additional Kusunda data in 1976, but for the most part,
our knowledge of the Kusundas and their language remained almost static from 1970 to
the present day.
     Ross Caughley, of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, made contact with a lone
speaker, Chudamani Ban Raja, in Rampur village of Palpa district in January 1980
(p.c.). The speaker was unaware of other Kusundas and reckoned that he was the last
surviving speaker. Caughley managed to elicit a few grammatical constructions and
some additional words, but apparently his findings were not substantive enough to
warrant publication (although he did include a single page of materials in his 1982 study
of the Chepang verb). Five years later, in 1985, Caughley attempted to contact Chudamani
a second time, but learned that he had already died. Also, in February 1983 and January
1984, Caughley traveled to some of the early Reinhard sites in Gorkha and met two
Kusundas in and around Cheptar Bazaar. Both were related to Reinhard’s informant,
but neither were able to speak Kusunda. They belonged to a younger generation.
     In the 1980s, word began to spread that the few remaining speakers known to
linguists and anthropologists were all deceased, and that their language had died with
them. The Ethnologue began to report in the 1990s that Kusunda had gone extinct,
saying that “three speakers were reported in 1970” and that “the last speaker was
reported to have died in 1985.” The claim is probably related to the death of Chudamani
Ban Raja.","[10, 11]"

10. Clause chaining
    “Clause chaining” is a clause combining strategy very common in the languages of
South Asia and syntactically distinct from English-type “co-ranking” structures like He
went to the forest and set traps. A basic feature common to classical clause chaining
languages is the distinction between chain-medial and chain-final verbs. Typically, the
verb belonging to the chain-final clause is the most finite, being marked for things like
person/number agreement and tense/aspect distinctions. Verbs belonging to chain-medial
clauses, on the other hand, are less finite, sometimes pared down to a simple verb root
plus some kind of non-final marker. Thus, it is termed “co-subordinate.” It is
subordinate in that it depends on the final verb for certain finite specifications, but
coordinate in that it lacks many features of true subordinates (Haspelmath 1995).
    With respect to clause chaining, Kusunda is typologically distinct from the languages
immediately surrounding it. First of all it distinguishes on a temporal scale between
“sequential” events and “overlapping” events, and secondly, it marks sequential events
as “co-ranking” and overlapping events as “co-subordinate.” In the surrounding
languages, like Nepali and Kham, there is no formal distinction between sequential and
overlapping events, and the only strategy employed is the co-subordinate one.","[124, 125]"
"5.5.7.      Hortatives and optatives
    The “hortative” and “optative” in Kusunda specify similar semantic notions, differing
primarily in the person involved in the predication. The hortative is a kind of first
person imperative expressing notions like ‘Let’s go!’ whereas the optative is a kind of
third person imperative expressing a notion of ‘Let him go!’ or ‘May he go!’5.5.7.1.     Hortative
    Our understanding of the hortative in Kusunda is still tentative. Part of the problem
is due to a close similarity in form between hortatives and first person past forms. In
Class I verbs, i.e. those with prefixed person marking, there is generally a defective or
poorly developed past perfective marking (sometimes missing altogether). Recall from
examples like (163–165) that past marking is characterized by -d-i ‘first person,’ -n-i
‘second person,’ and -g-i ‘third person.’ In verbs without the past distinction (some of
the Class I verbs) there is only a realis–irrealis distinction. It is in precisely these cases
that -di marks hortative, not first person past.
    Thus, with a Class I verb like ‘eat,’ realis and irrealis forms occur predictably as
follows, paralleling the forms for ‘beat’:
    (207)      Class I - EAT       Class II - BEAT
               REALIS:
               a. t-˙m-˙n          pumba-d-ßn        ‘I eat.’ / ‘I beat.’
               b. t-˙m-da-n        pumba-d˙-n        ‘We eat.’ / ‘We beat.’
               c. n-˙m-˙n          pumba-n-ßn        ‘You eat.’ / ‘You beat.’                                              79

             f.   g-˙m-da-k      pumba-g˙-k        ‘They will eat.’ / ‘They will beat.’
    In the past paradigm, however, Class I forms are defective – i.e. -di and -dei mark
singular and plural hortatives, not past tense:
   (209)     Class I - EAT       Class II - BEAT
             PAST:
             a. t-˙m-di          pumba-d-i         ‘Let me eat!’ / ‘I beat.’
             b. t-˙m-d˙i         pumba-d-˙i        ‘Let’s eat!’ / ‘We beat.’
             c.                  pumba-n-i         ‘You beat.’
             d.                  pumba-n-˙i        ‘You [pl] beat.’
             e.                  pumba-g-i         ‘He/she beats.’
             f.                  pumba-g-˙i        ‘They beat.’
    Forms -di and -d˙i (209a–b) mark the hortative in Class I, but past tense in Class II.
Furthermore, the forms expected in (209c–f) are generally missing from Class I, though
there appears to be some confusion on that count. Gyani Maiya and Kamala are in
disagreement on whether a form n-˙m-di is possible – Gyani Maiya says “yes” (as a
past tense); Kamala says “no”. The analogy between Class I hortative and Class II
past tense apparently confuses them. Though the forms n-˙m-di and g-˙m-di have a
familiar ring to them, they are unsure about their grammaticality and where to place
them.
    A question arises as to how the hortative is marked in Class II verbs. Unfortunately,
our notes are sketchy and inconsistent on this matter and we cannot give a definitive
answer. For some verbs we have homophonous forms for the hortative and first person
past:
   (210)     a.   a-d-i          ‘I made it.’ / ‘Let me make it!’
             b.   e-d-i          ‘I gave it.’ / ‘Let me give it!’
             c.   dzaÚ-d-i       ‘I bought it.’ / ‘Let me buy it!’
             d.   tsim˙-d-i      ‘I touched it.’ / ‘Let me touch it!’
   For other verbs we have the homophonous form plus a disambiguated form that
makes use of the Class I hortative form of the verb ‘get, go get, fetch’:
   (211)     a. pumba-di / -d-i
                beat-HORT / -1-PAST        ‘Let me beat it!’ / ‘I beat it.’
             b. pumba ts-i-di
                beat  1-get-HORT           ‘Let me (go/get) beat it!’
   The grammaticalization of a hortative from verbs like ‘come,’ ‘go,’ and ‘get’ is not
unusual and has been reported in numerous languages (see Aikhenvald forthcoming: on                                           80

"11.2.2.1 With continuity of TAM
    We have numerous examples in our corpus in which both sides of a conditional
clause, the protasis and the apodosis, are marked for irrealis. We have already seen in
§11.2 that the final clause of a conditional construction must be marked irrealis, and it is
not at all surprising that in a language for which irrealis marking is available, the protasis
side of the conditional should also be marked irrealis. (The surprising thing is that
irrealis marking is not always required on the protasis, a matter that we will discuss in                                            136

                 ‘If it rains tomorrow I won’t go.’11.2.2.2 With discontinuity of TAM
   In conditional constructions it is also possible that the protasis side of the construction
be marked for realis, replacing the expected irrealis. Here we get a disjunction of TAM
marking, as in the following:
    (368)     a. goraq          ta≥    g-iw-˙n       tsi ts-˙g-wa
                 tomorrow water 3-go-REAL I              1-go-NEG:IRR

                 2-eat-NEG:REAL cold-3-IRR:SG
                 ‘If you don’t drink it, it will get cold.’
     It is not known how the semantic interpretation of the sentences in (368) should
differ from those in (367). Some kind of evidential might be implied here. For
example, it might be that with realis marking in the protasis the speaker is stating
something about general knowledge – “If you don’t drink the tea, it will get cold” – or
even about his level of commitment to the outcome – “If it rains tomorrow (and I expect
it to do so), I will not go.” In any event, it is likely that the speaker is more strongly
committed to the possibility that the event in the first clause, though conditional, will
actually occur – something similar to the differences reflected in the English saying
“Not if, but when!” With irrealis in the conditional, nothing is certain, and the speaker
makes no commitment about the outcome.","[136, 137]"
"5.5.1.1.    Prefixing patterns (Class I)
    Verbs are marked for the person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or
plural) of the subject argument. There is no object agreement. Person and number are
separate indices. Class I verbs are defined as those in which person is marked by
prefixes and number is marked by suffixes.
    The underlying syllable shape of the verb root appears to have at least some bearing        In Kham, for example, the word for tumeric is borrowed from Nepali h˙lid˙, and ‘yellow’ is
    23built off that word – h˙lidyaso ‘tumeric-like.’                                               59

roots that begin in a vowel, and the suffixing pattern occurs primarily on verb roots that
begin in a consonant. Thus, the (a) forms in (139) and (140) illustrate the rule, and the

second person by n- in the same slot, and third person by g-, d-, or zero. Plural number

     The verbs ‘eat’ and ‘sleep’ are the most regular of the four verbs shown in (141)
and will serve as our starting point. The first element, a prefix, is t-/ts-, n-, or g-
according to whether the actant is first, second, or third person, respectively. The forms
are clearly based on the shape of the free pronouns tsi ‘I,’ nu ‘you,’ and gina ‘he, she,
it.’ The determination of first person ts- vs. t- is purely lexical and cannot be determined
by rule – phonological, grammatical, or otherwise.
     Other Class I verbs with first person ts- are the following: ts-oˆ-˙n ‘I drank,’
ts-o)-on ‘I put,’ etc. Other Class I verbs with first person t- are the following:
t-o)-˙n ‘I died,’ t-uk-an ‘I knew,’ etc.
     With the third verb, ‘come,’ the pronominal agreement forms are t-, n-, or Ø, and
with the final verb, ‘go,’ the forms are ts-, n-, and (seemingly) d-. In the latter case,
however, though d- possibly fills a person slot in the synchronic grammar, historically it
is the first element of the root and still surfaces in certain forms like the imperative – da
‘Go!’ D- as a third person marker, then, can be discounted on historical grounds.
     Again, as in first person ts- vs. t-, the determination of third person g- vs. Ø is lexical
and cannot be determined by rule. Other Class I verbs with third person Ø- are the
following: o)-˙n ‘he died,’ uk-an-dzi ‘he knows,’ etc. Many others take g-.
     Class I verbs are generally messy, with many irregular and suppletive forms. This is
very likely a consequence of their considerable age and maintained by high frequency

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––usage. A case in point are the plural forms for ‘go’ – ts-i÷-da-n ‘I went’ and n-i÷-da-n
‘You went.’ The vocalism [i] in the plural root [i÷] cannot be explained in the synchronic
grammar and nothing of the original root da remains. We end up with a suppletive
form.2 4
    Another irregular verb is the verb ‘sit,’ with first person s-, second person ¯-, and
third person h-, as in the following:
    (142)        1s    s-~aˆ an           ‘I sit.’
                 1p    s-~aˆ an           ‘We sit.’
                 2s    ¯-~aˆ an           ‘You sit.’
                 2p    ¯-~aˆ an           ‘You [pl] sit.’
                 3s    h-~aÚdzi           ‘He/she sits.’
                 3p    h-~aÚdei           ‘They sit.’
    It is possible that the underlying root in this case has an /h/ onset. The /h/ emerges
also in the imperative, as in: h~aˆ-no ‘Sit!’5.5.1.2.    Suffixing patterns (Class II)
    In contrast to Class I verbs, Class II verbs are characterized by person marking
suffixes. The majority of verbs in Kusunda belong to this class.","[59, 60, 61]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––10.2.3.1 A deceptive look-alike
     Kusunda has a construction which, on the surface, appears to be almost identical to
the benefactive construction used in Nepali and Kham (as illustrated by Kham in (353b)).
Structurally, it uses the converb -de on a medial verb, followed by the verb ‘to give’ as a
final verb. Careful probing, however, reveals that ‘give’ is not benefactive, but retains its
literal sense.3 8 We first began to realize this when sentences like the following created
confusion and heated debate:
    (354)      a. ?tsi-kolde du-ga l˙b˙-de            e-g-˙n
                  1S-knife   dirt-IN bury-CNV give-3-REAL
                  ?‘Burying my knife in the dirt he gave it to me.’
               b. ?tsi-gimi   kila-de     e-g-˙n
                  1S-money steal-CNV give-3-REAL
                  ?‘Stealing my money he gave it to me.’
               c. *tsi-gimi  sabe t˙mb˙-de e-g-˙n
                  1S-money there send-CNV give-3-REAL
                  *‘Sending my money there he gave it to me.’
     The verb ‘to give’ in all three sentences in (354) is incompatible with a literal
meaning for ‘give’ – hence their ungrammaticality or questionable grammaticality. Our
informants could force a reading of sentences (a) and (b), but insisted that they represented
two very incompatible events – for (a), the knife would have to be uncovered. Sentence
(c) they rejected outright, saying that the money could not be given after it had already
been sent.3 9
     For a language like Kham, the benefactive is required on all sentences in (354) for
the simple reason that doing something to one’s possessed item is equivalent to doing it
to the person – it forces an extra argument. The sentence in (c) would be a “malefactive.”
None of these observations apply to Kusunda.
     We were able to verify our hypothesis on the following sentences which are not
incompatible with a literal reading of ‘give’:
    (355)      a. gina t˙n-da       wi      a-de       e-g-˙n
                  he    me-ACC house make-CNV give-3-REAL
                  ‘Building a house he gave it to me.’
                  (not ‘He built a house for me.’)
               b. tsi-kæaidzi hul˙-de       e-go
                  1S-food     cook-CNV give-IMP
                  ‘Cooking my food give it to me!’
                  (not ‘Cook my food for me!’)    38
       Recall from §9.3.4 that ‘give’ is used in Kusunda in a permissive sense with the embedded verb
marked by -da. Interestingly, Masica (1976:148) notes that throughout the Indian area, only Telegu
“appears to lack the benefactive use of give.” He further notes that as an auxiliary, ‘give’ has a
permissive meaning only.
    39
        Interestingly, they can produce such sentences based on a Nepali template, but after discussion
they reject them on the basis that they are incompatible events.","[130, 131]"
"5.5.3.5.    Imminent aspect
    “Imminent” aspect, meaning ‘about to,’ is marked by ben, and collocates only with
realis or past tense. The event, though not yet realized, is, in some sense, already
asserted to be fact, as in the following:
    (179)     a. bem-dzi      ben
                 fall-3:REAL IMM
                 ‘He’s about to fall.’
              b. tsi ts-˙g-˙n     ben
                 I 1-go-REAL IMM
                 ‘I am about to go.’
              c. tsi gin-da     pumba-d-i ben
                 I he-ACC beat-1-PAST IMM
                 ‘I am about to beat him.’5.5.3.6.    Incompletive
    Another aspect, marked by -da, collocates with both realis and irrealis modalities.
(See also §11.3.) We have not yet determined all the variables, but tentatively we have
glossed it as a kind of incompletive (or imperfective). In realis mode, -da yields a kind
of “past imperfective,” or “past continuous” sense with habitual overtones, as in the
following:                                           70

                       ‘He didn’t used to let me eat, now he lets me.’
    In the right context, the construction can also mean ‘while X was happening,’ as in
the following:
    (181)      tsi ts-ip-ßn-da            n˙ti aoda d˙i-˙n
               I 1-sleep-REAL-INCOMP who door knock-NEUT
               ‘While I was sleeping, someone knocked on the door.’
    The same -da, used with irrealis, yields a reading of ‘would have,’ or ‘was about to,’
both senses compatible with non-fact modality. Following are examples:
    (182)      a. tok ts-ip-d˙k-da
                  we 1-sleep-PL:IRR-INCOMP
                  ‘We would have slept.’
               b. nu e-n-u-da
                  you give-2-SG:IRR-INCOMP
                  ‘You would have given it.’
    With a non-volitional verb like ‘fall,’ the interpretation is more often the latter sense
– ‘was about to,’ as in the following:
    (183)      gina nu        bem-dzi-da
               that person fall-3:IRR-INCOMP
               ‘That person was about to fall.’
   Other verbs that behave the same way are ip-dzi-da ‘was about to sleep,’ and
nu≥-dzi-da ‘was about to get up.’ It is not clear how this form contrasts with the
“imminent” aspect illustrated in §5.5.3.5.","[70, 71]"
"9.3       Complements
     There are numerous verbs which are capable of supporting sentential complements
as an object (or destination) argument – ‘go/come for the purpose of,’ ‘want,’ ‘be able
to,’ ‘allow,’ ‘finish,’ ‘see/hear that,’ ‘think that,’ and ‘know how to.’9.3.1         Purposive
    The “purposive” clause is a complement to matrix verbs ‘go/come,’ or ‘send/bring.’
We have already seen numerous examples of this clause type when we illustrated the
morphology of -da in §8.2. The purposive can also be marked by “neutral” morphology
(see §8.1). Here we reiterate some of the examples used elsewhere:
      (329)      a. WITH GO:
                    tsya qon-da            t -a -an
                    tea drink-PURP 1-go-IRR:SG
                    ‘I will go to drink tea.’
                 b. WITH COME:
                    nu n-˙m-n-a           n-ug-un
                    you 2-eat-2-PURP      2-come-REAL
                    ‘You came to eat.’
                 c. WITH SEND:
                    gin-da kam ˙n-da         t˙mb˙-d-i
                    he-ACC work do-PURP send-1-PAST
                    ‘I sent him to do work.’9.3.2         Desiderative
    The desiderative embeds complements to the matrix verb ‘to want.’ Literally, when
used with non-sentential arguments, the Kusunda verb means ‘to search for.’ As with
the purposive, complements of the desiderative can be marked “neutral” or with the
suffix -da:
      (330)      a. gina wi        ˙g-˙n         ~oˆ la-g-˙n
                    he   house make-REAL want-3-REAL
                    ‘He wants to build a house.’                                           120
                                       Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––               b. tsi wi        ˙n-da        ~oˆ la-d-ßn
                  I    house make-PURP want-1-REAL
                  ‘I want to build a house.’
               c. tsi gin-da      p˙rm˙-da     ~oˆ la-d-i
                  I    him-ACC meet-PURP want-1-PAST
                  ‘I want/wanted to meet him.’
   As in many other languages of the region, with ‘want’ the subject of matrix and
embedded clauses must be the same. Thus, it is not possible with this structure to say ‘I
want him to go’ – only ‘I want to go’ or ‘He wants to go.’9.3.3      Abilitive
    The verb ‘to be able’ is homophonous with the intransitive verb ‘to hide’; indeed, by
strange circumstances, it may be the same verb. The abilitive conjugates as an intransitive
verb. Syntactically, though, the verb allows a sentential complement marked either with
-da or as neutral, as in the following:
   (331)       a. tsi wi       ˙n-da            hyoq-tsi-n
                  I house make-PURP             able-1-REAL
                  ‘I can build houses.’
               b. t-˙m-˙n        hyoq-wa
                  1-eat-REAL     able-IRR:NEG
                  ‘I can’t eat.’
               c. tsi amba pad˙-n           hyoq-tsi-n
                  I meat hunt-REAL          able-1-REAL
                  ‘I can hunt animals.’   • Opportunitive. A second “abilitive” construction contrasts with the one above in
§9.3.3. The former implies physical ability, whereas this one implies “finding
opportunity.” It uses the matrix verb ‘to find’:
   (332)       a. t -a -an          d~aba-d-aÚ i
                  1-go-SUBORD       find-1-NEG:REAL
                  ‘I wasn’t able to go.’
               b. t-˙m-˙n       d~aba-d-aÚ i
                  1-eat-REAL find-1-NEG:REAL
                  ‘I wasn’t able to eat.’
    Notice that in (332a) that the mutating verb ‘go’ is marked by the mutated form of
‘go,’ indicating that it is subordinate. (See §8.4.)9.3.4      Permissive
   The permissive construction employs the matrix verb ‘to give.’ As in the other
complements we have seen, the embedded verb is marked by -da or as neutral:
   (333)       a. gina t˙n-da     wi      ˙n-da     eg-i
                  he me-ACC house make-PURP give-3-PAST
                  ‘He allowed me to build a house.’                                           121

    As we saw earlier in §8.4, and also with the implicative causative in §9.2.1, this
construction casts embedded mutating verbs in the “marked” form (elsewhere, the
“irrealis”).

                 me-ACC 1-go-SUBORD give-3-PAST:NEG
                 ‘He didn’t allow me to go.’9.3.5      Preventative
    The preventative construction employs the causative of the verb ‘to stand,’ and
means ‘to stop someone doing something.’ Two separate events are coded, and both
are fully finite. Following are examples:
   (335)      a. g-˙m-˙n       dæoˆ -a-d-i
                 3-eat-REAL stand-CAUS-1-PAST
                 ‘I stopped him eating.’
              b. g-u-ya,        dæo ˆ-a-yin
                 3-come-OPT,    stand-CAUS-PROH
                 ‘Let him come, don’t stop him.’9.3.6      Completive
    The completive matrix verb is the transitive verb ‘to finish.’ As far as we know, only
this complement structure requires both verbs (the matrix verb and the embedded verb)
to be coded in the same TAM. We repeat here example (177):
   (336)      a. wi       a-t-ßn          tumb˙-d-ßn
                 house make-1-REAL finish-1-REAL
                 ‘I finished building the house.’

                 ‘I finished building the house.’

                 *house make-1-REAL finish-1-PAST9.3.7      See and hear
    The verbs ‘see’ and ‘hear’ regularly support complements in which the embedded
clause is a separate, autonomous event from the matrix verb event. Not surprisingly,
both verbs are marked as fully finite, each of them expressing person–number and TAM
specifications for the immediate clause only. Following are examples:

house.’ Likewise, in (337b) the main clause event is ‘He saw,’ while the embedded
event is ‘I build a house.’ The events are entirely autonomous. The same holds for the
verb ‘hear,’ as in the following:
   (338)      a. tsi wa     t-ug-un      m˙b˙-g-i
                 I home 1-come-REAL hear-3-PAST
                 ‘He heard me coming home.’
              b. loÚl˙-g-i        m˙b˙-d-i
                 cry.out-3-PAST hear-1-PAST
                 ‘I heard him cry out.’9.3.8      Think
    The verb ‘think’ in Kusunda also means ‘to remember,’ as in tsi n˙n-da imba-d-i (I
you-ACC think-1-PAST) ‘I remembered you.’ We have only one example of the verb
with a sentential complement:
   (339)      tsi da≥        t -a -an     imba-d-i
              I     Dang 1-go-SUBORD think-1-PAST
              I think I will go to Dang.’
    Notice that here, too, like we saw in (329) and (334), the embedded “mutating” verb
‘go’ takes the marked case.","[120, 121, 122, 123]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––7.1.2       Morphological causative -da
    Most intransitive verbs can be made transitive by adding the morphological causative
suffix -da. Where such verbs belong inherently to Class I, i.e. having prefixed person
marking, after derivation they become Class II verbs – i.e. having suffixed person
marking. Thus, in the following examples, the (a) sentences are inherently Class I verbs
and their transitive (b) counterparts are Class II. Prefixed person marking is lost:
    (260)      a. INTRANSITIVE
                  ts-ip-ßn
                  1-sleep-REAL                ‘I slept.’
               b. TRANSITIVE
                  ip-da-d-i
                  sleep-CAUS-1-PAST           ‘I put him to sleep.’
    (261)      a. INTRANSITIVE
                  t-o -˙n
                  1-die-REAL                  ‘I died.’
               b. TRANSITIVE
                  o -da-d-i
                  die-CAUS-1-PAST             ‘I killed him.’
    Note that the causative of ‘die,’ i.e. the verb ‘kill’ illustrated in (261b) is very often
pronounced ora- and is an example of a verb developing what may someday become a
suppletive pair whose developmental pathway is opaque – -o) ‘die’ versus ora- ‘kill.’
    For Class II intransitive verbs there is no shift from prefixing to suffixing under
causativization – they begin with suffixed person marking. Such verbs can be made
transitive either by the morphological causative -a or by the morphological causative -da.
The choice of one over the other does not seem to be based on phonological factors or
the syllable type of the root. The verbs ‘sleep’ and ‘die’ both end in consonants and
the causative is formed by -da. But so also do ‘fall’ and ‘wear’ end in consonants, but
the causative is formed by -a (though -da is also possible with no apparent difference in
meaning, though, of course, there may be a difference in “force” for “directness” of
causation). ‘Scorch’ and ‘swell’ end in vowels, but both form the causative by -da.
There is a great deal of variation between the two forms. Following are verbs which can
take either form:
    (262)      a. INTRANSITIVE
                  hyoq-tsi-n

              b. TRANSITIVE I

                 insert-CAUS-1-REAL            ‘I inserted (something).’
    Some verbs, in addition to a causative morpheme, manifest some phonological change
in the root morpheme itself. The pair ‘to survive’ versus ‘to rescue’ is one such pair
(from ˙igi- to ˙gi-):
      (264)   a. ˙igi-d-ßn
                 live-1-REAL                   ‘I survived.’
              b. ˙gi-da-d-ßn
                 live-CAUS-1-REAL              ‘I rescued (him).’
    Some intransitives when causativized yield unexpected meanings. Two examples are
the verbs ‘to laugh’ and ‘to say.’ Causativized by the morphological causative they do
not mean ‘make laugh’ or ‘make say,’ but rather ‘laugh at’ and ‘say to.’ (Similar
semantic shifts occur in Nepali, suggesting the possibility of contact induced meanings.)
      (265)   a. gin-da nikæ-e-d-i
                 he-ACC laugh-CAUS-1-PAST
                 ‘I laughed at him.’

                 ‘No matter what I say to him, he cries.’
     It should also be noted that morphological causativization in Kusunda works even
on intransitive “process” verbs which would normally require a periphrastic causative
in English – verbs like ‘rot.’ The implication is that the subject is ultimately responsible
for the eventuality, even if only by neglect or inadvertence. Such causatives are typologically
common in the area, in both TB and IA languages:
      (266)   tsi yi-da         qau-da-d-i
              I wood-ACC rot-CAUS-1-PAST
              ‘I rotted the wood.’7.2      Anti-causative
    The anti-causative is a detransitivizing derivation on inherently transitive verbs yielding
intransitive and middle senses. In such verbs the “middle” or “anti-causative” <AC> is
marked by the suffix -q. The ‘break’ verbs are among them, as in the following sets of
contrastive pairs:

                 ‘This string is like it will break.’7.2.1      Anti-causative -q versus lexical -q
    Somewhat problematic are intransitive verb roots in which a final -q is part of the
underived lexical representation. On the surface, such verb roots look like derived
middles, but, in fact, there are no corresponding transitives without the -q. In such cases,
-q is not a derivational marker per se. Rather, the marker is semantically motivated,
occurring on verbs whose inherent status is middle. We will not separate the -q in these
cases, but treat it as part of the underlying root. (If we do find occasion to dissect such
forms, we will mark them as “middle marked” <MM>, recognizing that we are not
dealing with a derivation.) Under causativization, the middle marking remains (often
becoming -)), followed by the morphological causative -a, as in the following:
   (270)      a. wi      gyaq-ßn

                  ‘I spilled the water.’
    It is important to notice the contrast between verbs whose underlying root ends in -q
and verbs whose underlying root is an open syllable. In the former case, -q (or -))
occurs in both transitive and intransitive forms, whereas in the latter case -q occurs only
in the intransitive. Thus, in (272) -q is lexical and the transitive form is derived, and in
(273) -q is derivational and the intransitive form is derived:

    Another verb with lexical -q in the intransitive member is soq- ‘climb,’ as in:

                  ‘I treed him.’7.2.2       Anti-causative -t
     More difficult to interpret are intransitive verb roots which end in -t. Recall that in
many transitive verb conjugations (like a-t-ßn ‘I made’), -t followed by syllabic -ßn signifies
first person followed by realis. There are numerous intransitive verbs, however, in which
a stem final -t followed by syllabic -ßn does not indicate first person:
    (275)      a. dimi    n~odze gwi-t-ßn
                  smoke above gather-<T>-REAL
                  ‘Smoke (soot) gathered above.’

                  jug-LOC      water fill-<T>-REAL
                  ‘Water filled in the jug.’
    We have glossed -t in (275a–b) with a tentative <T>. The question is, “Is -t part of
the lexical root or is it a grammatical morpheme?” We know already that -t here is not
                                             101
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Transitivity alternations
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––first person. Following the same line of reasoning we used above, we need to compare
these forms with their causativized counterparts:
    (276)     a. tsi d˙idzi       gwi-˙-d-i
                 I firewood gather-CAUS-1-PAST
                 ‘I gathered firewood.’
              b. gag˙ri-ga ta≥           pæir-a-t-ßn
                 jug-LOC       water fill-CAUS-1-REAL
                 ‘I filled water in the jug.’
     The stem final -t does not occur in the causativized version (*gwi-t-a-t-ßn) and we are
left to conclude that -t is an anti-causative morpheme analogous to the -q we saw earlier.
It turns out, in fact, that we have no verbs in our corpus with root final -t. Where -t
occurs it is always anti-causative <AC>.
     In §5.5.1.2 (subsection intransitive patterns) we saw that Class II intransitive verbs
have the option of including a person marker immediately after the root-final consonant:
    (277)     a. sip-ts-in
                 enter-1-REAL             ‘I entered.’
              b. b˙l-n-in
                 descend-2-REAL           ‘You descended.’
              c. pæep-ts-in
                 fall-1-REAL              ‘I fell.’
              d. hyoq-n-in
                 hide-2-REAL              ‘You hid.’
    Significantly, where the same optional person marking is employed in intransitive
verbs with anti-causative -t, the -t occurs after person marking, separating the -t from the
verb root. This strengthens our hypothesis that -t is not part of the intransitive root:
    (278)     a. nok       gwi-ni-t-n-a-n
                 you[pl] gather-2-AC-2-PL-REAL
                 ‘You all gathered.’
              b. hampe t -a -an kæai-tsi-t-ßn
                 where   1-go-IRR fear-1-AC-REAL
                 ‘Wherever I go I get scared.’
              c. un-da      ts-˙g-˙n      miÚ-tsi-t-ßn
                 road-LOC 1-go-REAL lost-1-AC-REAL
                 ‘Going along the road I got lost.’
    We have numerous other examples, too, of “floating” -t in our data base, but we
will not list them all here.
    It would, of course, be satisfying to our claims if anti-causative -q also floated to the
right of person markers, thus demonstrating that it too is an element divisible from the
verb root. In fact we have no data in our corpus to prove this. (Nor do we have
anything to disprove it.) We have examples of person marking only on verbs in which
-q is part of the root, and as our claims would predict, -q remains attached to the root, as
in: borloq-tsi-n ‘I got boiled,’ and gyaq-tsi-n ‘I collapsed.’

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––7.2.3       Passive
    There is no canonical passive in Kusunda (of the English sort) in which the former
object is promoted to subject status. The closest analogue is the detransitivizing, anti-
causative derivation discussed in §7.2 which produces a kind of “middle.” The derivation,
however, appears to be available only to select transitive verbs.
    Another structure which is not well understood applies to transitive and intransitive
verbs alike. On Class II transitive verbs, the “auxiliary” ending ‘to do, make,’ is
replaced by a sequence -in-dzi. -Dzi occurs elsewhere as a “present tense” marker
(also not well understood; see example (265b)). The first affix, -in, resembles the
Nepali passive marker -in, but the resemblance may be accidental. It might be equally
plausible to think of -in as the intransitive (inchoative) version of ‘to do, make’ (see
(244b)). We will label it as <INCHO> for “inchoative.” Following are examples of its
usage (but with no attempted explanation on how the construction works)3 2:
    (279)      a. ACCOMPANIED BY AN ANTI-CAUSATIVE:
                  dza h~oÚ-˙-go             borlo-q-in-dzi
                  fire burn-CAUS-IMP boil-AC-INCHO-TAM (?)
                  ‘Stoke the fire, it (the water) will boil.’
               b. WITHOUT ANTI-CAUSATIVE:
                  qai   u-g-i         ip˙n sola-in-dzi
                  wind come-3-PAST corn break-INCHO-TAM (?)
                  ‘Wind comes and the corn breaks.’
               c. ON AN INTRANSITIVE:
                  n˙n gip˙n ts-o -da-d-ßn            dzæ˙m-in-dzi
                  what word 1-say-CAUS-1-REAL weep-INCHO-TAM (?)
                  ‘Whatever I say to him, he cries.’
    Note that (279a) is made intranstive by virtue of the <AC> marker -q, and (279c) is
intransitive already. (279b) begins as a transitive verb, and appears to be detransitivized
by the inchoative -in.
    We have several examples of intransitive verbs marked by this construction, but are
uncertain about how the meaning differs from ordinary intransitive conjugation without
-in: kæai-in-dzi ‘He is afraid’; meÚ-in-dzi ‘He gets lost’; dæ~u-in-dzi ‘He stands, rises’;
by~o-in-dzi ‘He sits, squats.’7.2.3.1     “Passive” in ambi-transitive verbs
    It is difficult to say unequivocally whether some verbs are inherently transitive or
intransitive. They can be conjugated as transitive or intransitive without mediating
derivational morphology, and the intransitive version is passive-like. The verb ‘to burn,
roast’ is one such verb, as in the following contrastive pair:
    32
       My anonymous reviewer has suggested that because the -in- marker in all the examples listed
occurs on the second clause of a complex sentence, it might indicate that the second clause event is a
consequence of the first clause event. The suggestion warrants looking into.","[97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"

say to you, don’t sleep!’? If not, -tsi marks some unknown category:

                  2-die-1-PROH             ‘Don’t die!’5.5.6.2.    Verbs that participate in both -in and ˙-yin prohibitive
    Some verbs are capable of taking either the -in prohibitive or the prohibitive ˙-yin
based on the verb ‘to do.’ In the majority of cases, this makes for an intransitive/transitive
difference, as in: bem-in ‘Don’t fall!’ vs. bem ˙-yin ‘Don’t make him fall!’ (See §9.2
on Periphrastic causatives.)
    The verbs that concern us here, however, are those which take either ending without a
perceptible difference in meaning. Following are examples:
(206)          a.   n-o -˙n / n-o ˙-yin              ‘Don’t die!’
               b.   n-o ˆ-˙n / n~o ˆ ˙-yin           ‘Don’t drink!’
               c.   pumba-n-in / pumba ˙-yin         ‘Don’t beat him!’
               d.   hab-en / hab˙ ˙-yin              ‘Don’t roast it!’
               e.   tsim-in / tsim˙ ˙-yin            ‘Don’t touch it!’
    Further research may reveal varying levels of transitivity or even levels of intentionality
in such verb pairs.","[78, 79]"
"9.3.9      Know how
    The verb ‘to know’ in Kusunda expresses the notion of ‘how to do something’ and
can include abstractions like gina gip˙n uk-an-dzi (he language know-REAL-<??>) ‘He
knows Kusunda (= He knows how to speak Kusunda)’. Knowing a person employs a
different verb tsirma- ‘recognize,’ which is used as a matrix verb for ‘believe.’ (See
§9.3.10.)
    In our corpus of data we have only cases in which both the matrix verb ‘know’ and
the embedded complement verb are coded as realis:
   (340)      a. tsi wi     a-t-ßn           t-uk-an
                 I house make-1-REAL 1-know-REAL
                 ‘I know how to build a house.’
              b. nu wi      a-n-ßn           n-uk-an
                 you house make-2-REAL 2-know-REAL
                 ‘You know how to build a house.’

                    ‘You won’t know how to break (harvest) corn.’9.3.10       Believe
     The complement construction ‘to believe something’ employs the matrix verb whose
literal meaning is ‘recognize.’ We have only one example:

                 ‘I believe it will rain.’9.3.11       Show how, teach
    ‘Showing’ or ‘teaching how’ to do something employs a complement construction
we have not yet seen (except briefly in §9.2.2), and we will hold off discussing it till we
get to §10.2 on Overlapping events.","[123, 124]"
"2.2.      Tibeto-Burman and other borrowings
    We encountered several words in Kusunda that appear to have Tibeto-Burman
origins. Given, however, that the vast majority of lexical items in Kusunda show no
resemblance whatever to other languages or language families of the region, we are
probably looking at borrowings from Kham, Magar, or Chepang. Following are the
words:
    (4)   a.   gwa         ‘egg’          <     gwa       Magar ‘chicken’
          b.   tu          ‘bug’          <     du        Magar ‘bug, insect’
          c.   h~aÚ        ‘face’         <     h~aÚ      Gamale Kham
          d.   p˙itoba     ‘Damai’        <     tæubla    Gamale Kham
          e.   p˙yet       ‘leech’        <     pyat      Chepang
          f.   ran         ‘millet’       <     r~aÚd˙i   Takale Kham
          g.   sat         ‘comb’         <     sat       Magar, Proto Kham
          h.   ip/im       ‘sleep’        <     ip/im     Proto Kham
          i.   am          ‘eat’          <     am        Chepang ‘rice’, Karen ‘eat’
          j.   hampe       ‘where’        <     hampe     Yamphu    Though the first two words, gwa ‘egg’ and tu ‘bug’ bear resemblance to Magar
words with similar meanings, the Magar words are decidedly unusual for Tibeto-Burman.
More common TB forms are ba or bwa for ‘chicken,’ and bu for ‘bug.’ It is possible
that the Magar forms were borrowed from Kusunda.
    The verb am ‘to eat’ in (4i) which corresponds to Karenic, may be purely accidental.
It occurs in none of the surrounding languages, except as ‘rice’ in Chepang. Perhaps
more difficult to explain is (4h), the word for ‘sleep.’ It seems unusual that such a word
would be borrowed. Furthermore, *ip is the Proto-Tibeto-Burman etymon for ‘sleep,’
and the word in its proto form cannot be found in the surrounding languages. Chepang
and Magar use different etyma. Gamale Kham has im- (also occurring in certain
paradigmatic forms in Kusunda), and Takale Kham has s-ep- as a causative ‘put to
sleep.’ One or both forms were certainly in use in Proto Kham, and may be the source
for Kusunda ip/im.
    Many more words have been borrowed from Nepali, a much more recent phenomenon
than borrowing from Tibeto-Burman. Our informants were reluctant to give us Nepali                                           15

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Morphology of subordinate structures
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    • On Class I verbs. The embedded verbs that we saw in §8.2.1 can also appear in
their person-inflected forms. There is no apparent difference in meaning (though there
certainly may be subtle differences). In such cases, the purposive morpheme -da
participates in a person agreement paradigm, such that -d-a marks first person environments
and -n-a marks second person environments. Third person reverts back to -da (there is
no -g-a). Thus, this form contrasts with the uninflected -da forms in the following way:
   (300)     UNINFLECTED -DA:
             a. tsi am-da        t-ug-un
                I eat-PURP 1-come-REAL
                ‘I came to eat.’
             INFLECTED -DA:
             b. tsi t-˙m-d-a      t-ug-un
                I    1-eat-1-PURP 1-come-REAL
                ‘I came to eat.’
             c. nu n-˙m-n-a        n-ug-un
                you 2-eat-2-PURP 2-come-REAL
                ‘You came to eat.’
             d. gina g-˙m-da      u-g-i
                he 3-eat-PURP come-3-PAST
                ‘He came to eat.’
    In (300b) and (300c) the purposive marker is no longer simply -da, as we had in
§8.2.1 and also in (300a). Rather, the forms are inflected for first and second persons –
-d-a and -n-a, respectively. Also, the form of the embedded verb includes prefixed
person markers – t-, n-, and g-.
    The paradigms for these verbs are irregular, as is generally true for all Class I verbs.
Thus, the third person form of ‘eat’ includes a third person prefix g-. With the verb ‘to
sleep,’ however, such a form is disallowed. We get ip-da but not *g-ip-da. With the
verb ‘to fetch, get’ there is no first, second, third person inflection for the purposive
morpheme -da. Rather, all forms take the second person -na form of the purposive and
a third person g- prefix on the verb stem irregardless of person:
   (301)     a. g-i-na            t-ug-un
                3-fetch-PURP      1-come-REAL
                ‘I came to get (it).’
             b. g-i-na         n-ug-un
                3-fetch-PURP   2-come-REAL
                ‘You came to get (it).’
             c. g-i-na          u-g-i
                3-fetch-PURP    2-come-REAL
                ‘He came to get (it).’
     That g- is a person prefix can be seen in the following inflections: ts-i-di ‘I fetched
it’; n-i-di ‘You fetched it’; g-i-di ‘He fetched it.’
     Some Class I verbs have suppletive roots that are used with the -da construction.
The verb ‘to go’ is one of them. (302a) shows the base form as a benchmark, and
(302b) shows the suppletive form:                                           110

                 ‘I wouldn’t go there.’    • On Class II verbs. To our knowledge, the -da structure in Class II verbs is
always an “inflected -da,” i.e. the morpheme has different representations for first,
second, and third persons. (An exception can be found in §8.2.2.) Here, a third person
-g-a is also possible:
      (303)   a. tsi amba hul˙-d-a      t-ug-un
                 I    meat cook-1-PURP 1-come-REAL

                 he/she meat cook-3-PURP come-3-PAST
                 ‘He/she came to cook meat.’
   Recall that in Class II verbs the suffix -d is almost always a marker of first person,
contrasting with second person -n and third person -g. In Class I verbs, the -d that
occurs in an identical phonological sequence is not the same -d, but part of the following
morpheme. So far, we have seen the following distinctions:
      (304)   CLASS I:                      CLASS II:
              -di        ‘past’             -d-i        ‘first person–past’
                                            -n-i        ‘second person–past’
              -da        ‘plural’           -d-a        ‘first person–plural’
                                            -n-a        ‘second person ‘plural’
              -du        ‘irrealis’         -d-u        ‘first person–irrealis’
                                            -n-u        ‘second person–irrealis’
              -da        ‘purposive’        -d-a        ‘first person–purposive’
                                            -n-a        ‘second person–purposive’8.3       Finite embedded structures
    Many constructions whose embedded verb can be marked by a neutral, non-finite
form, or marked by -da, can also be marked as finite. Thus, the following (a) and (b)
sentences contrast in form, but we are unaware of any semantic differences:
      (305)   a. tsi wi       ˙n-da         ~oˆ la-d-i
                 I house make-PURP want-1-PAST
                 ‘I wanted to build a house.’
              b. tsi wi       a-t-ßn          ~oˆ la-d-i

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Morphology of subordinate structures
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    For some verbs, especially Class II transitives, there are three contrasing forms, as in
the following:
      (306)   a. kæaidzi hab˙-˙n        t-ug-un
                 food      cook-NEUT 1-come-REAL
                 ‘I came to cook food.’
              b. kæaidzi hab˙-d-a       t-ug-un
                 food      cook-1-PURP 1-come-REAL
                 ‘I came to cook food.’
              c. kæaidzi hab˙-d-ßn         t-ug-un
                 food      cook-1-REAL 1-come-REAL
                 ‘I came to cook food.’ / ‘I cooked food and came.’
    There are limits on the finiteness of the subordinated verb. In general, the more
finite the embedded verb, the greater the likelihood that two different events are being
coded. The sentence in (306c), for example, could also be interpreted to mean ‘I cooked
food and came.’ Based on the same principle, the embedded verb in some constructions
must be marked with the same TAM as the matrix verb. Both verbs convey the same
event:
      (307)   a. wi       a-t-ßn         tumb˙-d-ßn
                 house make-1-REAL finish-1-REAL
                 ‘I finished building the house.’
              b. wi       a-d-i           tumb˙-d-i
                 house make-1-PAST finish-1-PAST
                 ‘I finished building the house.’
              c. *wi    a-t-ßn      tumb˙-d-i
                 *house make-1-REAL finish-1-PAST
   We will deal more with the specifics of TAM interplay when we deal with specific
constructions in §9, and in §10 on co-subordinate structures.","[109, 110, 111, 112]"

    6
        It is interesting to note that in Reinhard and Toba’s (1970) description, the word for ‘son’ is
listed as duguci [dugutsi], which also, very likely, includes a contracted form for [getse] ‘child,
offspring.’                                                 23
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Phonology
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––4.3.       Vowels
   As already mentioned, Kusunda has six vowels, three forming an upper set and three
forming a lower set, as in the following:
   (9)       Kusunda vowels:
                i           u
                      ˙
                e           o
                      a
    In terms of absolute contrasts, it is difficult to find contrastive pairs of words in
which the consonants remain constant, but one word utilizes a vowel from the upper set
and the other word utilizes the corresponding vowel from the lower set – i.e. minimal
pairs for vowels. In many words, especially within polysyllabic morphemes, there is a
certain amount of free variation between the two sets (as borne out in tape recordings
from one day to the next). Following are examples:
    (10)     Variation between [i] and [e]:
              a. gitsi          ~       getse            ‘child’
              b. gip˙n          ~       gep˙n            ‘language’
              c. gidzi          ~       gidze            ‘name’
              d. mihaq          ~       mehaq            ‘Kusunda’
              e. yi≥gu          ~       ye≥gu            ‘stone’
   Interestingly, the variation reported in (10a) constitutes a minimal pair in careful
speech:
    (11)       a. gitsi         ‘thorn’
               b. getse         ‘child’
     Likewise, similar variation occurs between [u] and [o] as well as between [˙] and [a],
as illustrated in the following examples:
   (12)      Variation between [u] and [o]:
              a. gulu≥         ~       golo≥             ‘round’
              b. mu≥           ~       mo≥               ‘king’
              c. hyudzi         ~       hyodzi           ‘fat, swollen’
              d. tukan         ~       tokan             ‘know’
              e. hul˙dßn       ~       holadßn           ‘I cooked it.’
    (13)     Variation between [˙] and [a]:

              c. hul˙dßn        ~       holadßn          ‘I cooked it.’
    As with the contrast between gitsi ‘thorn’ and getse ‘child’ illustrated in (11), with
these vowels too, contrastive pairs can be found, as in the following:
    (14)       a. pæuÚdzi       ‘He jumped.’
               b. pæoÚdzi       ‘He shot.’

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    It turns out that much of the free variation we encountered occurs in polysyllabic
words where [h] or one of the velar sounds [k], [g], or [≥] occurs. It is significant, in
this respect, that uvular sounds, especially the voiced ones [ ], and [ˆ], occur only with
vowels [o] and [a], displaying a kind of harmony within a syllable.7 It is not altogether
surprising, then, to find their neighbors, the velar sounds, somewhat ambivalent in their
preference of upper or lower vowels.
    Though minimal contrasts are rare in our data set, the following words and morphemes
further illustrate the contrast between upper vowels [i, u, ˙] and lower vowels [e, o, a]:

    (See also the contrast between inchoative ˙- ‘become’ and causative a- ‘make’ in
§6.1.4 and example (243).)4.3.1.     Vowels and uvular consonants
   Only vowels [o] and [a] can occur following uvular consonants.8 The constraint,
however, is unidirectional – it is a constraint on the consonant, not on vowels. Other
consonants, too, can occur with [o] or [a], as in the following:
    (19)     a. qan                 ‘itch’
             b. kan                 ‘sharp’
             c. ˙ga                 ‘Come!’
    (20)     a. qolom               ‘bad’
             b. kolumu              ‘owl’
             c. goloq               ‘sheep’    7
          This occurs also in Eskimo-Aleut. Bergsland (1997:21) reports that the vowels [u], [i], and [a]
occur before labial or velar consonants, but in contact with uvular consonants they become [o], [e], and
[a], all retracted.
    8
        In Reinhard and Toba’s transcription all [q]s are followed by an [a] or [o], though they too seem
to have found some phonemic evidence for a [k] vs. [q] contrast in central vowels.","[23, 24, 25]"

                  (not ‘I’ll bring it for you.’)10.2.3.2 A lexical benefactive
    Recall from §6.1.4 that many transitive verbs are modelled after the verb ‘to do,
make,’ as in: abi a-t-ßn (carry do-1-REAL) ‘I carry it.’ Some of the same verbs (but
apparently not all of them) can substitute the verb ‘to give’ in place of ‘to do.’ Where
this occurs, we get a benefactive reading, as in:
    (356)      a. ni-bæari abi        e-d-u
                  2S-load     carry give-1-IRR:SG

                  ‘Beat it (for me).’10.2.4      The “teach” converbal
     The “teach” converbal employs the overlapping converbal marker -de, followed by
a finite form of the verb ‘to show.’ The following examples show that the verb ‘show’
is not in a sequential relationship with the preceding verb, but an overlapping relationship.
It implies teaching by example, ‘showing how’:
    (357)      a. tsi n˙n-da        wi      a-de       unda-d-u
                  I you-ACC house make-CNV show-1-IRR:SG
                  ‘I’ll show you how to build a house.’
                  (not: ‘I’ll build a house and show you.’)

                  (not: ‘He cooked meat and showed me.’)10.2.5      Causative converbal – ‘send’
   We saw the periphrastic causative ‘send’ earlier in §9.2.2, but we are now in a
position to discuss it more fully. The ‘send’ causative contrasts with the ‘make’                                            132

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––causative in at least two ways. First of all, the ‘make’ causative is an implicative
causative, i.e. it implies that the embedded event also occurred. With the ‘send’ causative,
such an implication seems to be weaker (though we are not yet sure). Secondly, the
‘send’ causative employs the “overlapping converb” as part of its structure. (The
‘make’ causative did not.)
    The overlapping converb carries with it the implication that the two verbs in the
clause chain are at least partially continuous, both temporally and thematically. This
contrasts with a sequential interpretation, in which the initial verb-event occurs first and
the final verb-event later. These clauses are bitransitive with a hierarchical structure.
The accusative marked object is an object of the higher verb and the embedded object is
unmarked. Following are examples:
    (358)     a. tsi n˙n-da        wi      a-de       t˙mb˙-d-u
                 I     you-ACC house make-CNV send-1-IRR:SG
                 ‘I’ll make/have you build a house.’
                 (not: ‘I’ll make a house and send you.)
              b. nu gin-da          wi      a-de        t˙mb˙-n-i
                 you him-ACC house make-CNV send-2-PAST
                 ‘You made/had him build a house.’
                 (not: ‘You built a house and sent him.’)
    Part of the force of the ‘send’ causative is captured in the English idiomatic expression
(from Shakespeare) She sent him packing, which means something like, ‘She made him
leave.’
                                            133
11. Combinations of finite clauses
In §10 we looked at clause chains of two types – 1) those that code events which occur
in temporal sequence, and 2) those that code events in which there is some kind of
temporal or semantic overlap. There is a formal structural difference – the former are
“co-ranking” in structure, all verbs being finite (and hence equal in rank, Longacre
1985), and the latter are “co-subordinate,” making a distinction between medial verbs
(non-finite) and final verbs (finite).
    In this chapter we will look further at co-ranking structures – those clause combinations
in which both verbs are finite. These are clauses of coordination, of condition, of
adversity and concession. But because there are no explicit clause connectors, like
‘and’ or ‘but,’ in Kusunda, the semantic relationship between any two co-ranking
clauses is a matter of inference. This is not to say that the inferences are not dependent
on certain grammatical and pragmatic factors; they are. Two very broad factors that are
relevant to our study are 1) the level of continuity between clauses, and 2) the particular
TAM marking employed. Continuity between clauses implies conjunction, and disconti-
nuity implies disjunction. It also turns out that irrealis marking on the final clause of a
two-clause construction almost always implies a conditional construction.","[131, 132, 133, 134]"
"10.1    Sequential events
    Sequential events occur in temporal chronology – Having eaten he left is an example;
eating occurs first and leaving second. Kusunda has such sequences, but all verbs in the
chain – medial and final – are fully finite. Furthermore, medial verbs have no special
marker to distinguish them from final verbs. As such, these are “co-ranking” structures
(Longacre 1985) and differ from the “co-subordinate” structures we will look at in
§10.2. Following are examples:

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Clause chaining
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    All of the sequences above retain the same subject for both verbs and would occur in
other languages of the region as classic clause chains – the first verb would occur as a
non-finite medial verb (plus linking morphology), and only the final verb would occur as
fully finite with person inflection. English, too, would treat all the sentences in (342) as
“same-subject” chains by deleting the second pronoun — ‘You hid and you slept.’
    The kinds of sequences illustrated in (342) are not formally different from the
coordinated structures we will look at in §11.1. The only difference, if any, might be
based on semantic inferences. The structures here were elicited as sequential chains
(using Nepali -er˙), while the structures in §11.1 were elicited as non-chains like After I
eat I will go.","[125, 126]"
