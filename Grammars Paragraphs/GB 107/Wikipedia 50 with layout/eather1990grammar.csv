    Although occurrences of ngamarramung with affirmative irrealis (i.e. future) verbal clauses    are possible, in all examples I have, ngamarramung is always qualified by a preceding    djawa ‘could be' in these circumstances. The composite construction djawa ngamarramung    means ‘should be able’ or ‘supposed to be’. An example follows:
    (168)   Djawa ngamarramung baykkirdaddja naddjoka.

It only occurs with irrealisy negative verb    forms with second person subjects (A) or (S) and always precedes the verb form (V). It     means ‘stop V-ing' or ‘never/don't ever V'. As far as I know it cannot be used to modify     any other word class (i.e. apart from a verb) and it never occurs as part of a composite of     particles. The restriction to second person subject means that mungana is associated with
     negative verb forms that are used as negative Imperative constructions (see also 5.4.2.3.),     but, like the standard negative particle korla it does not actually occur with an Imperative
     verb form. (Only the negative Imperative particle yingawa ‘don't’ occurs with Imperative     verb forms.) Restriction to irrealisy negative verb forms means that only Contemporary and
     Future negative verb forms occur (i.e. C/T NEG and FUT NEG) with mungana. Examples
     of mungana occurring with both an intransitive and a transitive verb follow:                                                        344

 Formation of realis
                 verb forms from monosyllabic roots is quite straightforward for all
 transitive monosyllabic verbs; the PC/T or C/T tense suffix is simply added to the
‘ monosyllabic root. The root syllable then carries the primary stress.
 Formation of irrealis;
                   verb forms (i.e. affirmative future and PC/T negatives (see 5.4.1.1.
 and 5.4.1.2. )) is standard for verbs i) to iii) only. It is normal for PC/T negative forms to
 use the same stem as affirmative future forms. However for verbs iv) to vii) the C/T realis stem compound is used for formation of PC/T negative stems rather than the affirmative future stem.
 For v) djo ‘scold’ an irregular stem kuya replaces the monosyllabic root in affirmative
 future forms. For vi) ka ‘take’ the affirmative future form takes an increment dji giving an
 extended root djika with stress on the increment syllable.
 Formation of Minimal Imperative forms from monosyllabic roots is quite straightforward
  for most of the transitive monosyllabic roots. For verbs i) to iv) the Minimal Imperative
  form (where (O) = 3MIN) is the monosyllabic root alone, as in ma! ‘get it!', rda! ‘spear it!""  etc.","[250, 251]"

The negative particle korla in (10) and (12) above can be omitted. The meaning of the clauses would then be something like 'I could have hit him’ and ‘S/he could have broken
 it’. Alternatively, other subjunctive particles can substitute korla (like ngamarramunga,
 djarra       and djawa      (meaning (approximately) ‘tried but failed’, ‘should have’ and ‘could have' respectively,(see 7.3.2.3 and 7.3.2.4 a & b.)) and all variations have irrealis
 meaning.","[211, 212]"

  The particle ngarra can occur adjacent to other particle
                                                                   s. These strings of adjacent particles
  can sometimes be glossed as a composite of their literal
                                                           meanings, and sometimes not.
  When, for example the negative Particle korla occurs with
                                                             ngarra, as korla ngarra the
  combination means ‘not even’ as in (100) and (101).
                                                      The function of ngarra        to introduce
  new, Contrastive or unexpected information is implicit
                                                         in the gloss ‘even’ in this composite.
 (Compare here the use of 'even' with a negative in English
                                                                : ‘didn't even telephone, let
 alone write.') So too in Nakkara, ngarra is used to invite
                                                               contrast, or where something

 Korla ngarra differs from korla yabba           and korla bardakka'still not, ‘not yet’ (see 7.3.3.4.
- and 7.3.3.5.) in that a verb following the latter construction

  form. Interestingly, this is not a necessary requirement for

"6.2.1,   Monosyllabic     Root   Increments      .
A verb root increment occurs preceding any monosyllabic
                                                     root that has a pronominal prefix
and a zero morpheme in the tense suffix slot. This includes all Inrealisy (C/T and future
negative) verb forms, non-Minimal Imperative forms and also the affirmative future stems
for ka ‘take, carry' and (y)ba ‘go’. Root increments are always monosyllabic; they function
basically as morphophonemic padding for the monosyllabic root. A verb-complex
consisting of a pronominal prefix, a monosyllabic root and no tense suffix (such as
bana+ma- or ngiba+rda-Q) is problematic for rules of stress assignment in the language:
primary stress is assigned to the first syllable of the root, but can never occur on the finalsyllable of a word with two or more syllables. So, the monosyllabic root takes an
increment which then carries the primary stress.Monosyllabic root increments for irrealis
and non-Minimal Imperative verb forms are listed in Table 6.2.2. below.Discussion of
verb root increments and other irregularities involved in stem formation for monosyllabic
verbs follows. In 6.2.2. we look firstly at the seven transitive monosyllabic roots. In
 6.2.3. we look at the five intransitive monosyllabic roots.",[250]
"In addition to these “true” negative Imperative and Hortative constructions, future negatives
and subjunctives can also be used like Imperatives and Hortatives. In this situation, second
person future negative verb forms are used with the negative particle korla or (in the case ofsecond person Imperatives only) with the subjunctive particle mungana ‘cease’, ‘don't

 which, in Nakkara is quite straightforward. Verbs can be classified according to transitivity Class and also according to conjugation sets. In Nakkara there are ten conjugation sets, with
 an additional four subsets. These conjugations are grouped              according to the tense
inflections that occur with the particular verbs (see 3.2. for discussion of tense distinctions
 in Nakkara), and do not appear to be related to the conjugations reconstructed for proto- Australian (see Dixon 1980:402ff.).","[231, 232, 233]"
" There are ten conjugation classes in Nakkara (see 6.1. for details). Status refers to the realis-irrealis distinction, which in Nakkara means specifically, whether an action or event has or has not occurred. Mood is a broad category that overlaps to some extent with Status and includes negative, potential, subjunctive, imperative, hortative and evidential. Tense, Status and Mood are coded within the verb complex but can be triggered and supported by spatio-temporal qualifiers and particles outside the verb. Tense, Status and Mood are peripheral operators in clause structure.",[420]
" It is important to realize that the irrealisy component /*y/ does not occur with all negative VCs. Contemporary and Future negatives and subjunctives have irrealis, marking
 preceding the PP and have an empty tense slot. See 5.4.1.3. and also Table 5.4.1.1.
  below, which is a summary of the points made about different types of prefix structure.
  The purpose of this discussion has been to explain the function of the irrealis component  /*y/ and the constraints on its use. In summary, it occurs as an indicator of future tense and
  also as a partial indicator of Pre-Contemporary negative constructions.",[212]
" The form nangarda liya(wa) means literally something like “what of it"" and usually means ‘why7?'. This form can also occur in negative constructions as in (50).",[324]

7.3.2.6. ngamarramung              ‘unfulfilled      potential’,     ‘mistaken    perception’,The particle ngamarramung is used to modify a clause or phrase X where 'X could be/have           but the
 been so’, pote    ntia      l
                     is unfulfilled. The ‘potential’ involved can be either unmarked or ‘obligational’ (required of the entity as an obligation). The difference is usually clear from
 context. Obligational potential can be translated as ‘should be/have been so’ and unmarked
 potential as ‘would be/have been so' or ‘could be/have been so’. This particle always
 immediately precedes the clause or phrase it modifies.
 The requirements of epistemic modality in Nakkara mean that because the potential is
 unfulfilled, a verb following this particle will always have irrealis status, and is usually in
  negative mood. If a cause, reason or excuse for the unfulfilled potential is mentioned this is
  usually introduced in the clause following by the particle agarra ‘and(new)', ""but’  (heralding new or contrastive information). Some examples of ngamarramung in context
  follow:
  (163)     Ngamarramung ngayrddayama ngarrawa namurakka.               [ngamarramung       ngay      +rdda      -ya        -ma_      hgarrawa    namurakka]

"An additional ambiguity of interest is the derivation of the locational word kunarawabba
‘in the middle’. The root may be kunara ‘belly’ or kunarawa            ‘horizon’. It is clear,
however, that kunarawabba is a derived word-form. It would be listed separately from bothkunara and kunarawa in the dictionary. If kunarawabba ‘in the middle’ is derived from
kunara+wabba, this is an additional example of the ""Proximal"" suffix having derivational as well as inflectional function.

This subjunctive particle usually precedes the clause it modifies, but can
                                                                           follow it.
Djarrabba differs from another otherwise similar subjunctive particle ngamarramung‘Unfulfilled Potential’ in that the former does not require a negative verb-form. In fact
djarrabba       seems    to be restricted to realis verb forms; I have found it with Pre-Contemporary and Contemporary but not with Future verb forms. (Notice
                                                                      in example
(152), the Contemporary tense already allows for a future reading.) Note that
                                                                              the particle
djarra ‘should’, ‘actually’ (discussed below in 7.3.2.4.b.) can occur with Future
                                                                                  verb

"The function of ngarra is to introduce new information. It can serve to highlight a change
                                                                                                     of
participants between two clauses or a switch of actions or events with
                                                                              same or shared
participants.In so doing ngarra can provide a temporal link between two clauses,
                                                                                            for
sequential actions/events (‘and then’) or simultaneous actions/events (‘while’). It
                                                                                    frequently
occurs following a negative construction where it is usually glossed as 'but'.
The clause following ngarra can therefore represent an alternative course of action,
                                                                                either
sequential or simultaneous (see examples (89) and (90) below). This also
                                                                         holds for its
occurrence following a negative (as in (91)); in an alternate irrealis clause ngarra
                                                                                                 might
herald the reason why one action was unsuccessful (as in (92)); ngarra can introduce
                                                                                                 a new
or different set of participants (e.g. in (89) and (90)), or indeed, a switch of location
                                                                                          (as in
(95)) or a new topic (as in (98)). In (99) agarra functions as ‘and' between
                                                                             the final pair in

not. It always precedes the verb, and the verb is always a negative form. Because
                                                                                    clauses

                                                                                        that
the scope of karaddjabba is restricted to verbs, it might have been included as an Adjunct
rather than a clause-modifying particle, however, adjuncts do not generally affect the mood
of a verb and are not usually restricted to a slot immediately preceding the verb. For thesereasons karaddjabba is discussed as a particle. Some examples follow. (The form of this
particle is interesting in that it contains djabba         (‘similative', see 7.3.3.1.) and might be
likened to a similative particle for verbs only.)

The forms karrakkerra and ngarrakkerra are interchangeable,although I have not been able to discover any reason (¢.g. dialectal) for this variation. Theform karrakkerra occurs more commonly. This particle always immediately precedes the
verb with which it is associated unless that verb occurs with a preceding adjunct (see
(180)). It occurs commonly with Imperative and Hortative verbs and also with (irrealis)fature declarative forms. I have been able to elicit occurrences of karrakkerra with realis
verb forms, although the particle ngamarramung ‘unfulfilled potential’ (with concomitant
"" negative verb form) is preferred in these constructions. Some examples follow: (179)    Karrakkerra rrabbuba yirddaya namurakka, ngawakana.           karrakkerra         rra         +bbu     -ba             yi          +rdda    -ya

This formative can occur with the negative particle meaning ‘nobody’ (non-Minimal),
however the Minimal form korla njingka ‘nobody’ will more often be used as a short-handform (as in (59) above, which has a non-Minimal subject). Note also that these forms arenot used in Nakkara for translations of ‘anyone’, anybody’, but instead, a generic use ofthe first person inclusive Unit-Augmented prefix with the nominals -nakkelaya 'human'
and -korrawa ‘many’ occurs, as in the following example:
(63)   Ngunnakkelaya ngunakorrawa (ngunangoyabbana kandiddjawa).
        ngun     +na      -+kkelaya             | nguna            +korrawa

          can make damper.
 7.25. kaya     ‘what',    ‘which’;         ‘able’
 This formative has two rather restricted interrogative uses. Firstly, kaya precedes the
 inflected demonstrative pronoun -kara ‘this here’ as kaya (p)-kara to mean ‘which one/s?’.",[328]
"
The formative -njingka occurs with the negative particle korla as korla njingka or korlakin(n)jingka meaning ‘no-one’, ‘nobody’. It also occurs with the particle mubba ‘and
(more)' as (ki(n))njingka mubba ‘who else? and korla mubba njingka ‘no one else’ as inthe example following:
(59)    Korla mubba njingka bandjirddayama.
        korla       mubba         @      +njingka               bandji         +rdda        +ya   “-ma

(Non-Minimal)This is also a nominal stem that inflects with third person Attributive prefixes, but is always
a non-Minimal form. Like -njingka the equivalent Minimal form, -ngardawa refers only tohuman persons. Inflected forms can be interrogative or indefinite. Some examples follow: (60)    Karrbangardawa trbaniyeka errbblen nayana?         karrba     +ngardawa            =mrrba    -ni         +ye      -ka           errbblen      nayana

"   With transitive verbs the situation is a little more complex because of the number of PP
   forms involved. Nevertheless, the underlying form of the negative prefix can still be
       construed as /ka/, and in fact only twelve of the thirty-three different transitive realis PP
       forms change        when        used in an irrealis? construction.    Table   5.4.1.3.b.   shows   the       comparative realis and irrealis, PP forms where (O) = 3 non-fem. Formation rules for
       transitive irrealisz prefix forms follow.",[219]

1.1.   Linguistic   TypeNakkara is the language spoken by the Nakkara people of the central Arnhem Land coast.","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"
" In 6.3. we discuss the derivational affixes na- and rda- which provide a verb root with
 locational orientation. These affixes precede the verb root and do not affect the transitivity
 of a verb. They occur with approximately 35% of the verb corpus, usually, but not always, intransitive verbs of motion. Although this affix is derivational, the affix plus verb root structure is not included in the verb corpus discussed in 6.1.
 Following the verb root and preceeding the tense inflection, a reflexive or reciprocal affix
 -(ndji)ya- can occur. This is discussed in 6.4. Although          this affix usually occurs with
 transitive roots to derive an intransitive stem, it can also be added to intransitive roots to
 give, say, a reciprocal meaning.
  In 6.5. we discuss the Inchoative affix /miyal, which derives an intransitive verb stem from a nominal root. This affix follows the nominal stem and precedes the tense inflection.
 There is an enclitic particle form /-bba/ that occurs suffixed to verbal forms.to convey ' and
 then (x happened)' and is probably a contraction of the particle mubba ‘and then’. This is
 discussed with other particles in 7.2.1.2.
 6.1. Verb Roots and Conjugation              Class.
 Recognition of verb roots in Nakkara is relatively straightforward. The verb root is the nucleus of the verb, with no prefixes or suffixes. The pronominal prefixes and tense suffixes are,generally, easily distinguished from from the verb nucleus, as are the other
 derivational affixes found within a verb-complex. In fact the verb root is usually identical to the (affirmative) Imperative form in Nakkara (see 5.4.2.), which also coincides with the- Future verb stem when there is a zero. morpheme      inflectional suffix for this tense (almost 80% of conjugations).","[233, 234]"

Like mukkawa, the particle ngawa can stand alone, but ngawa cannot introduce the protasis
of a conditional clause, or be used meaning ‘either/or’.",[357]
"  In 7.2. we look at the set of Interrogative and Indefinite words in Nakkara. Although this
  section might have been placed within the context of sentence types in a syntax chapter,
 they are included at this point because many of them are locational and temporal in nature
  and therefore relate to the spatio-temporal coordinates introduced in 7.2.
_ Section 7.3. consists of discussion of Particles in Nakkara. We distinguish two particle
  types, clause-modifying (discussed in 7.3.1. to 7.3.3.) and predicate-modifying (discussed
  in 7.3.4. as Adjuncts). Clause-modifying particles include Connectives, which can serve as “introductory as well as clause linking devices and Mood particles, which can affect the
  form of the verb-complex. Adjuncts occur as outer-core operators within a clause and  supply information about the semantic links between participants (core operators) and their ’ actions. These include what we traditionally call Adverbs of Manner as well as other  adverbial-like forms.             .
  7.1. Spatio-Temporal         Qualifiers  The term ‘spatio-temporal qualifier’ is used to refer to a class of word that operates clause-
  peripherally and provides information relevent to the spatial/locational or temporal
   coordinates of utterance. (Some locational qualifiers have adnominal function in addition to
   their peripheral adverbial function; both functions are discussed in this chapter.) There are
   no formal criteria for membership of this class and individual forms are said to belong
   solely on the basis of the abovementioned functional requirement. If formal distinctions
   were made within the class we would have to postulate a whole range of formal types in
   addition to the non-inflecting morphologically simple qualifiers that typify ‘spatio-temporal
   qualifiers’ and ‘adverbials' in many languages. Accepting functional criteria instead allows
   discussion not only of morphologically complex forms, but also spatio-temporal phrases   which form an important part of peripheral clause structure.
   The most important difference between the perception of spatio-temporal concepts in
   Nakkara and English is the virtual a                           it
    and the veritable network of these in English. Looking at spatial concepts firstly, there are                                                 267

7.1.1.   Locational    QualifiersLocational Qualifiers are a class of word that functions adverbally, and in some cases alsoadnominally, to give specific locational reference to a given object or entity, or to events,processes and activities referred to or spoken about. Locational qualifiers are deictic in thesense that they ‘relate utterances to the spatio-temporal co-ordinates of the act of utterance’
(Lyons, (1977:636), but they are functionally (if not always formally) distinct from someof the nominal deictics.
Nominal deictics in Nakkara include Personal Pronouns and Demonstratives.(See 3.3.4.and 3.3.3. respectively.) Personal Pronouns and Demonstrative Pronouns give specific
‘reference to nominal heads only. Locational qualifiers, which, in a functional sense include
Demonstrative Adverbs and Derived Demonstratives, are not limited in scope to associated
NPs (i.e. persons and objects), but can give spatial information about whole clauses,
including events, processes and activities being talked about or referred to. The
Demonstrative Adverbs and Derived Demonstratives, while functioning like locationalqualifiers as peripheral elements of a clause are classed with other demonstratives on thebasis of shared Demonstrative stems (see.Table 3.3.3.).","[288, 289, 290]"
"The form kunarawa ‘middle distance’, ‘further’ and also the nominal form kunarawabba ‘inthe middle’ are probably derived from kunara ‘belly’. The semantic extension is clear when
we see the belly as a middle part, a half-way point of the body. The form kunarawa can
    also be used to describe a clearing, a clear flat place (suitable for camping) in bushland. The
    gloss ‘further’ usually means specifically ‘further than belamabba’. It can be given in
    response to ""How far is it? Is it close?"" Korla (belamabba), kunarawa. ‘No it's not close,
    it's further on’. Aboriginal English equivalents for kunarawa           are ‘half-way’ and ‘little bit    long way'. However, I have heard kunarawa ‘further’ used to specify other spacial
    qualifiers, such as nakkarrakarra kunarawa ‘forther than distant.
    To qualify and express greater distances and spatial areas involves, in turn, a greater variety
    of word-forms referring to spatial parameter. The form nakkarrakarra ‘long way’ consists
    of a reduplicated base-form karrakarra. This base also forms the word karrakarrawabba ‘all
    along/around’, ‘all the way’, +wabba being a Proximal suffix meaning ‘near there’, ‘in the     area of’ (see 4.7.3 and 4.7.3.3.). The form nakkarrakarra           ‘long way' can occur with the     Ablative suffix +kkawa 'from' (see 4.7.1.4.). Interestingly, nakkarrakarra can also be used
     as a time qualifier meaning ‘for a long time’, in which case it is interchangeable with     nawarra ‘(for a) long time’ (sce 7.1.2.3.). The form karrakarrawabba ‘all along’, ‘all the
                                                     280
 way' does not occur with an Ablative suffix, presumably because it already has the derivational Proximal suffix -wabba..
 The word nabbalawarra is a locational nominal form which refers to a large, wide open place, but can also occur as a qualifier meaning ‘over a wide area’. It also occurs without,
 the nominalising prefix na- as balawarra          meaning ‘wide’, ‘large’ or ‘over a wide area’.
 The reduplicated form balaya-balaya can substitute both nakkarrakarra and karrakarrawabba and therefore has a range of meanings ‘long way’, ‘all around’, ‘all the way’. This form
 can also occur with the Ablative suffix. An unreduplicated version balaya has been heard meaning ‘all the way’. This is also found as a composite form balaya nakkarrakarra ‘all the- way there' and with the time qualifier nawarra ‘long time’ as nawarra balaya ‘long ago’, ‘for a long time’. The form barrbarra is apparently borrowed from neighbouring Burarra
 and has a similar but slightly more restricted sense than balaya-balaya. Barrbarra does not
 occur with the Ablative suffix.

The Interrogative/Indefinite formative nangarda        is a nominal form, consisting of thenominal prefix na and the stem ngarda      ‘?something’. This stem also occurs in the forms-ngardawa ‘some persons’, nangardawa ‘some kind’, probably in the word for ‘one
(thing)' ngardawa-niya , its feminine equivalent ngardawa-nguya ‘one (thing (fem.))’,
ngardawabba ‘alone’, ngardawabba-ngardawabba ‘separately’ and possibly in the particle
ngardawa ‘because’ (?= some reason). This formative is commonly used in sentences like
 (36), where it may be read as an interrogative request for (more) information (about an object substance, action) or as an expression of indefiniteness. As an Interrogative formative nangarda usually occurs in sentence initial position. Therefore, an unambiguous
_ indefinite reading of (36) would be as in (37), where indefiniteness is expressed by inserting a personal pronoun and therefore removing the formative from sentence-initial
 position.

bardakka can be used as an interjection meaning ‘hold on!', ‘wait!', used to forestall
action, or to indicate that the speaker intends to continue.
While relating a series of events leading to a ceremony, the speaker stopped and said:

 where it means ‘well, anyway’; very similar in fact to the use of ‘still’ in
 “Still, you can't do much about it."" An example from Nakkara follows: (198)     Bardakka, kabanakkanabba ngunbimarrbba.                           kabana      +kkanabba                ngunbi    +marrbba    -@

" Chapter4: The morphology of Nakkara is extensive and is therefore divided into ‘three separate chapters. In this chapter we examine nominal morphology in general, looking firstly at independent pronoun      morphology     then at pronominal     affixes. Lastly   the morphological functions of non-pronominal affixes and postpositions are introduced.
  Chapter 5: This and the following chapter deal with the morphology of verbal structures in
  the language. In chapter five the verb-complex (VC) is defined and the morphological
  components of the verbal pronominal prefix are analysed extensively. This introduces the  notions of verb transitivity and valency, pronominal participant identification, the
morphology of tense, status and polarity distinctions as well as Imperative and Hortativeconstuctions.","[10, 11]"

The particle mukkawa ‘maybe’, perhaps’ can either stand alone as a response expressing
indefiniteness, or can occur with (usually preceding) a clause or NP to suggest some doubtor lack of information about a proposition; sometimes mukkawa is used in posing a
question and also where in English we might use ‘either’ and ‘or’.","[355, 356]"
