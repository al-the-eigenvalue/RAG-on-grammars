3.    Negative particle: It is also used with the negative particle naɖem ‘not’. {ʈʰi}is employed with negative particle when the negative particle is used for a shortresponse of a sentence or clause. This is illustrated by the example (3.120a and3.120b).
            (3.120a) ka         pramod   ʈʰi   əŋ                       INTM     Pramod   COP   Jarawa                       Is Pramod a Jarawa?            (3.120b)    ʈʰi      naɖem                        COP      not                        He is not.",[154]
"4.5 Negative clauses
Negation in Jarawa can be expressed in two ways: either by using theindependent negative word naɖem or the suffix –ma. Both are used for clausalnegation. There is no semantic difference between the two, but the suffix –ma hasrestricted use in the language while naɖem can be used across the board.",[181]
"
An affirmative response of (4.70) is presented in (4.73).",[185]
"5.4.13 Negation
Jarawa employs two strategies to express negation: either putting a negativeword at the end of a clause, or using a negative suffix to the verbs. Though thenegative word can be used in any type of clause, whether verbal or verbless, thenegative suffix is used only in verbal clauses. Examples in (5.33–5.38) illustrate                                                                              213

the use of the negative word while example (5.39) demonstrates negation of theverbal clause.

170
Morphological negation may also be used, i.e. the suffix {-ma}. (4.80)demonstrates the use of negative suffix {-ma} in prohibitives.              (4.80) ullel ɖə       bəᵼʈʰe-ma                      sea   LOC     go-NEG                      Don’t go in the sea.","[187, 188]"
"4.6.2   Prohibitive clauses
Prohibitives are a kind of command, order, or advice to not to do something. InJarawa, these are formed by putting the negative element naɖem after the verb,like it happens in simple negative sentences.
        (4.79) ullel    ɖə      bəᵼʈʰe   naɖem                 sea    LOC     go       NEG                 Don’t go in the sea.",[187]
"
4.5.3   Use of ɲag
For short responses or an answer to a yes/no question, Jarawa uses the negativeparticle ɲag at the beginning of the negative response, followed by the negatedsentence. For instance, the negative response to the yes/no question given in(4.70) would be (4.71).
        (4.70) ka     ŋa-kaja            pečame               INTM   2POSS-mother       die               Has your mother died?        (4.71) ɲag    ma-kaja           pečame naɖem               No     1POSS-mother      die       NEG               No, my/our mother has not died.",[185]
"                                                                                             163

4.5.1   Negation with naɖem
The position of this negative element in a clause is after the predicate. To negatea declarative clause, the structure in (4.56) is to be used.

3.8 Copula {ʈʰi}
The morpheme {ʈʰi} has various usages in this language. It is used for identifyingan entity, or to qualify a noun. This morpheme also comes with the negativeparticle, if the negative particle is used for short responses. It is also used withspatial adverbs in short responses. Sometimes this morpheme appears with verbswhen the verb is used in adverbial relation to the main verb. Based on thedifferent usages of {ʈʰi}, it can be termed a copula in this language.","[151, 152]"
"
The morpheme {ʈʰi} was identified as copula. This copula is used to identify anentity or qualify a noun. It was also seen employed with negative particles andwith temporal and spatial adverbs in short responses. Sometimes this morphemewas also seen with verbs which were performing the function of adverbs. Thecorpus suggested that this copula does not take inflection, but one example wasfound where it was inflected for mood.",[244]
"4.5.2   Negation with suffix {-ma}
Another way to negate the sentence in Jarawa is to employ suffix {-ma} on theverbal predicate. But in such constructions, the verbal predicate does not takeany other suffix (for instance, modality suffixes). Thus the {-ma} suffix replacesany other suffixal markings. Sentence (4.67) demonstrates the use of the {-ma}suffix for negation. In this sentence, allema ‘come’ does not have any other suffix.(4.68) is ungrammatical because allema ‘come’ bears the suffix {-hə} which doesnot allow the suffix {-ma} to negate the sentence. In such cases, one has to employnaɖem to express negation.
        (4.67) uʈʰa     allema-ma               Uʈʰa     come-NEG               Uʈʰa did not come.        (4.68) * uʈʰa   allema-hə-ma               Uʈʰa     come-HYP-NEG               Uʈʰa may not come.",[184]
"There is one example in the corpus which shows that the question particle maybe used in between the noun phrase and the question word. In example (5.49)cajwaj ‘name of a girl’ is a noun phrase and ʈʰucəʈəgə ‘where’ is a question word,and question particle comes in between the two. The example given in (5.49) canbe articulated without question particle as given in (5.50). It is surprising thathere the question particle cannot be used in the beginning of the sentence; theuse of question particle at the beginning of the clause in (5.51) makes thesentence ungrammatical.
      (5.49) čajwaj       ka             ʈʰučəʈəgə?",[235]
"Descriptive adjectives and manner of adverbs follow the head while numeralsand demonstratives precede the head. In the comparative degree, the marker ofcomparison follows the standard of comparison. The copula precedes non-verbalpredicates in copula constructions. Negative particles or suffixes appear at theend of the clause.",[249]
"Similarly in the case of suffixes, one of the suffixes denoting evidential marker,modality marking or negative marking can attached to a verb. (3.51) and (3.52)demonstrate the use of suffixes {-hə} and {-ma} and (3.53) and (3.54) show thatboth suffixes cannot attach simultaneously.",[123]
"
Chapter 4 gives an account of the syntactic structure of the language. Thisdescription includes verbless predicates and verbal predicates. This chapter alsofocuses on negative constructions, interrogative clauses and imperativestructures. Complex constructions are also included in this chapter.",[53]
"
In syntax, the different syntactic structures of Jarawa, and their variances werediscussed. These syntactic structures included simple clause structures,interrogative constructions, imperative sentences, negative constructions, and226
                                                                               227
cleft constructions. It was also observed that this language follows the ergative-absolutive system.","[244, 245]"

naɖem is the only negative element which can be used in verbless clauses. Thestructure of verbless clauses with naɖem is presented in (4.61). The exampleswhich follow demonstrate the use of naɖem in these environments. naɖem occursafter the nominal or adjectival predicate.","[182, 183]"

To express negation, this language makes use of an independent word naɖemafter a predicate (verbal or verbless), or a suffix -ma on a verb. There was nosemantic difference observed between the two. We saw that the independentword naɖem could be used across the board while the suffix -ma had restricteduse.","[246, 247]"
"5.4.14 Question particle
Jarawa employs the question particle in yes/no questions. However, this questionparticle also has (limited) use in content questions (wh-questions). The examples(5.40) and (5.41) demonstrate the use of the question particle in yes/no questionsof verbless clauses while examples (5.42) and (5.43) show the use in yes/noquestions of verbal clauses.
      (5.40) ka      ŋi əŋ?",[233]
"However, the use of the question particle in content questions is limited. Mostlycontent questions are formed with the question word in situ. The examples (5.46–5.48) illustrate the usual way of forming content questions, where questionwords are employed without the question particle.",[234]
"
3.4.2     Verbal affixes
In Jarawa, verbs take one prefix and one suffix. Generally, in the prefix categoryare pronominals (PRO), referential/definiteness markers (REF) or co-referencingelement (COREF), while as suffix are evidentiality marker (EVD) modality ((MOOD)

and negative marker (NEG). The structure of a verb with its affixes is presented in(3.48).","[122, 123]"
"Verbless clauses include structures which have two nouns in juxtaposition, or anoun with an adjective. In verbal clauses, the focus was on clauses with verbs asthe head of predicates; they include intransitive verbs, transitive verbs,ditransitive verbs and denominalised verbs. I also examined the variousstructures forming simple clauses, such as interrogative sentences, imperativesentences, negation, and so on. Complex sentences were also described, whichinclude coordinating structures and complementation. The language employsclause internal complement clauses and clause external complement clauses.",[214]
"
3.4.5.3 Modality Marking
 I.       Assertive Mood
           {-jag}
The assertive/emphatic marker {-jag} has two variant forms {-jag} and {-g}. Theconditioning environment for the occurrences of these two variants isphonological. If a verb ends with the vowel /a/, the {-g} suffix will be attached toit. {-jag} is used in all other cases. It generally indicates emphatic mood or showsa strong assertion. For example, in sentences (3.73–3.75) it means that the speakeremphasizes or asserts the action of giving and going.",[132]
"                                                                              187

4.9.1   Grammatical relations
Different grammatical roles and the relations between them can be expressed byvarious means at the syntactic level. Some languages employ case marking todifferentiate the different roles of the core arguments; some languages resort thefixed word order for the same purpose. In the case of Jarawa, grammaticalrelations between arguments are expressed through referential marking.","[205, 206]"

Two kinds of roots were attested: free root and bound root. Three kinds ofprefixes were confirmed, which were possessive prefixes, pronominals, and thereferential/definiteness marker. In the suffix category negative suffix, evidential

1.0 IntroductionThis dissertation aims to present a descriptive grammar of the Jarawa language.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"
In the adjective category, this language was observed to demonstrate descriptiveadjectives, numerals, and demonstratives. Descriptive adjectives consist of wordsrelated to colour terms or which define, describe, and qualify nouns. Also foundwas marking of the degree of adjectives. In degrees of comparison positive,comparative, and superlative degrees are attested. The positive degree is formedby the noun phrase and adjective. The comparative degree was seen to beexpressed syntactically. In the comparative degree, the standard of comparisonwas observed to precede the marker of comparison, and the adjective to followthe marker of comparison. Superlative degree was seen as formed by employingthe intensifier or a completely new word which was not found to have anyresemblance with the adjective of positive degree.",[243]
"4.9 Function of {ɖi}
The uses of morpheme ɖi seem to be various. Generally, this morpheme appearsafter a noun phrase to indicate definiteness. It can occur with a S(ubject) NP orO(bject) NP but rarely occurs with A(gent) NP of a clause. This usage of ɖisuggests that it is also employed to express grammatical relations in a clause.",[202]
"
In the category of complex sentences, I explored coordination and complementclauses. A conjunction ən ‘and’ was found to be used to express coordination. Incoordinated clauses, it was found that conjunction ən ‘and’ can be employed atphrase level and clausal level to form coordinated clauses.",[247]
"
4.8 Complex sentences
The present corpus shows evidence of coordination, and of direct and indirectspeech. There is no substantial evidence for complex sentences involvingsubordination. Distinguishing between direct and indirect speech is difficultsince no complementiser or any particle is used in such constructions.",[194]
"
In interrogatives, we looked at yes/no questions and wh-questions, which differsyntactically. Yes/no questions are formed by placing the interrogative marker kaat the beginning of a clause, while in wh-questions the wh-word occupied its situposition. The use of the interrogative marker with some wh-questions was alsofound.",[247]
"As mentioned, the question particle may also be used in content questions. Theexamples (5.44) and (5.45) show this.
      (5.44) ka-ŋi         kahiunen   onəhə     ɖi     h-ija-g?",[234]
"
Yes/no questions may also be formed out of verbless clauses by using theinterrogative marker ka as shown in (4.85), followed by some examples.
      (4.85) [ka] [subject]NP [VL Predicate]VLP
    (4.86)   ka     ŋi əŋ ?",[189]
"The sentence (3.99) can also mean only the phrase ‘these arrows’. It is difficult tosyntactically assess whether (3.99) is a clause or a phrase. If this phrase isemployed as a subject or an object of a clause, then it can be interpreted as ademonstrative adjective. For instance, in example (3.100), luwə paʈʰo-le ‘those
                                                                                  125
126
arrows’ is an example of a demonstrative adjective as this entire noun phrase isused as an object of the clause.
           (3.100)   luwə           paʈʰo-le   ɖ-eŋge                     DEM-A         arrow-PL    REF-bring                     Bring those arrows.","[143, 144]"
"
The way this morpheme is employed in this language also indicated that thismorpheme expressed grammatical relations, i.e. ergative-absolutive system. Thelanguage    employs     split   ergative-absolutive   system.   In   the   case   ofdefiniteness/referentiality this morpheme was usually employed with S or O. Theuse of the morpheme with A was rare if S or O were found to be

definite/referential. Thus, this morpheme conveyed grammatical relations in thecontext of definiteness/referentiality. With an indefinite object this morphemewas not employed with S, O, or A.","[248, 249]"
"
The superlative degree is formed by combining the adjective with an adverb, orby using a new word which is not morphologically similar to the positive form ofa descriptive adjective. In (3.103), there is an adverb ʈʰuhumə ‘very’ which is usedto indicate superlative degree.
          (3.103) kopel-wa-a:w                ʈʰi       huʈʰu     ʈʰuhumə                    Kopel-POSS-bow            COP       big       very                    Kopel’s bow is the biggest one.",[145]
"
No syntactic case marking was observed in this language. However, twomorphemes were attested as postpositions to express semantic case. Thesemorphemes were {ɖə} and {ɲačʰe}. The morpheme {ɖə} has multiple functions inthis language. This morpheme was found to express place of location, source oflocation, and goal of location. It was also frequently found with temporal and                                                                             225
226
spatial adverbs, but not always. The morpheme {ɲačʰe} expresses thecommitative.","[243, 244]"
"
5.4.1 Word order in clauses
Typologically, word order in clauses means the order of subject, object and verb.",[222]
"5.4.12 Causative construction
SOV languages have a tendency to form morphological causatives by means ofsuffixes. Contrary to this, Jarawa employs a prefix to form morphologicalcausative. In example (5.31) is an intransitive verb tʰulə ‘sleep’. The causativeform of the tʰulə is constructed by adding prefix {wa-}. The example in (5.34)represents a declarative sentence while (5.31) is an imperative sentence.
         (5.31)     əččəle     wa-tʰulə                    child      CAUS-sleep                    Make the child sleep.          (5.32)    wa-mummə        əččəle   ɖi    wa-tʰulə                    3POSS-father    child    REF   CAUS-sleep                    His/her father made the child sleep.",[231]
"
The copula can be the head of a predicate; it takes modality suffix. Data in thecorpus, at this point, is limited to only one sentence. Thus it is difficult toascertain whether the copula should be considered as a predicate. Moreover, ithas another function in the syntactic structure of the language: it is sometimesused with verbs used to indicate adverbial function (detailed discussion in § 3.8).",[162]
"
2.8    Conclusion
This chapter has discussed the problems associated with the identification andestablishment of sounds in Jarawa, and the methodological principles adopted todecide whether a sound is a phoneme or not in this language. I have also coveredvowels and consonants. In the discussion of the distribution of the sounds, I havedemonstrated the occurrences of consonants at both syllable and word level andthe occurrences of vowels at word level. The chapter also analysed thephonological processes in which there was an issue related to the use of ‘mi’ and‘ma’ forms in possessive constructions. I have also observed that there is atendency in this language to use reduced forms in the case of possessiveconstructions and compounds of two words, where the second word is reduced.",[90]
"
Jarawa expresses evidentiality morphologically. Evidentiality in Jarawa falls intotwo types: verifiable and non-verifiable. In verifiable cases, the speaker presentsthe event as truth, and the hearer can verify the truth of the statement byexamining. In non-verifiable cases, the hearer does not have this facility. TheJarawas distinguish two types of evidentials in the non-verifiable category: onewhere the event is recent, so its effect of the event is still present; and the otherwhere the event is not in the recent past, so its effect may have been lost.",[126]
"
3.5.3   Degree of adjectives
Jarawa differentiates between degrees of comparison. The language displayspositive, comparative, and superlative degrees. The degree of comparison is notexpressed morphologically. Rather, syntactic strategies are employed to expressdegree of comparison. Positive degree is formed by using noun and adjective,illustrated by (3.101).
      (3.101)   tenmej       ʈʰi       čew                PN           COP       good                Tenmey is good.",[144]
"
Imperatives are formed by using the verb with its core argument. As we saw,there is no morphological marking to differentiate imperatives from other kindsof sentences.",[247]
"
4.7.2   Wh-question
In wh-questions in Jarawa, some NPs in the clause are replaced correspondingquestion words (interrogative pronouns/adverbs). The wh-words stay in situ, i.e.the question word used for the subject NP would stay in canonical subjectposition and the question word used for the object NP would stay in canonicalobject position. Other question words (interrogative adverbs like when andwhere) also appear in canonical positions. Interrogative sentences with wh-words explored below.
1. onne ‘who’
The question word onne ‘who’ is used for humans. It can be employed for the Sargument of an intransitive verb, the A argument of a transitive verb, and anindirect object (including benefactors).
      (4.90)   onne   ɖi        olleg-ɖə          bəᵼʈʰe?               who    REF       Olleg-LOC         go               Who went to Olleg/Lakaralunda?",[190]
"
Two different kinds of complement clauses were also discussed. These two typesof clauses were clause internal and clause external complement clauses. In aclause internal complement clause, the complement clause occurs within themain clause in the object position of the verb phrase. Clause externalcomplement clauses were described as instances of direct speech in thislanguage. Since the language was found to be SOV, meaning the object occupies                                                                             229

the slot before verb, these kinds of constructions were considered as clauseexternal complement clauses.","[247, 248]"

This is a general strategy to negate the clause whether it is a declarative, aninterrogative, or an imperative sentence. The examples (4.59) and (4.60) showinterrogative and imperative sentences, respectively.
        (4.59) onne      ɖi      lə:w        ɖ-eŋge-jə           naɖem                 who     REF     honey       REF-bring-VEVD      NEG                 Who didn’t bring the honey?        (4.60) bəᵼʈʰe     naɖem                 go       not                 Do not go.",[182]
"In the present study these pronominals are divided into two groups according totheir usage. At the level of syntax, there seems to be distinction: one form is usedas subject and the other form is used as object. Forms like mi, ŋi, and hi arealways used in subject position of a sentence/clause. ma, ŋa, and hiwa are used inobject position of a sentence/clause. This is illustrated in examples (3.8) and (3.9).
          (3.8)        ŋi    ma           əjojəba                       2     1ACC         see                       You saw me.          (3.9) mi           ŋa           napo      ɖ-ija                    1        2 ACC        fish      REF-give                       I gave you the fish.",[97]
"
In such constructions, there are two clauses: one which is called reporting speechconsisting of reporting verb and another which is referred to reported speech. Inthe present study reporting speech is referred to as main clause while reportedspeech is referred to as dependent clause. In Jarawa the reported speech followsthe reporting verb but there is no particle or marker to distinguish the twoclauses: main clause and dependent clause. Thus, the direct speech in Jarawa hasthe structure as given in (4.112).",[199]

5.1 Language typology
Typology literally means the study of types. In linguistics, typology means thestudy and classification of languages according to their structural features.",[215]
