"12.2.5. Negative particles wonggo and warnaThere are two negative particles wonggo and warna, which do not appear to differ in
possibilities of syntactic distribution, but do differ in relative frequency. Of the two,
wonggo is the most common in the speech of all from whom lengthy texts have been
collected, with the exception of one person whose texts tend either to have approximately
equal numbers of these particles, or a slight preponderance of warna. However, since
this person was a minor contributor to the text collection overall, it is difficult to know
what to make of his case. People from whom the greatest amounts of material were
collected, including notably Elsie Raymond, her father, and Lily Gin.gina, used both
particles, but showed a disproportion ranging as high as ten to one in any given text in
favour of wonggo, but in some texts (those with the lowest number of negated clauses)
occurring in equal proportions.
   Both are clausal negators, and generally occur immediately preceding a finite verb, or
before particle plus finite verb combination, or sometimes in between particle and finite
verb (see below). Both may negate verbless predications, i.e. those in which the
predicative constituent is a nominal (including pronoun), and the 'missing verb' to be
understood as a copular one of being. Negations of existence of something in a place
are generally made with -wagbawun suffixed to a nominal (5.3.2.). Although warna is
overall less frequent and both negators may occur in all possible syntactic contexts, there
nevertheless appears to be a slight preference for warna to be more frequent in verbless
(zero copula) construction type rather than as negator of overt, finite predications,
compared to the frequencies of wonggo in these two different contexts. This suggests
there may formerly have been a clearer distributional difference between them, but if so,
it has been eroded.
   Both particles may occur with the range of tense-aspect-mood forms, i.e., with present,
past, ordinary future, and potential. Because of the particular meaning of the
'admonitive' category, designating an as-yet unrealized situation as unwelcome (e.g.,
""lest he get sick""), the negative particles are not found, or at least have not been found
in material collected, in that construction type.
   As discussed in 8.9.2., functional negative imperatives are not distinct from negated,
irrealis present forms of the verb, thus irrealis yi-ni-marn-bu-n 'you (SG) may make it'
and negative imperative wonggo yi-ni-marn-bu-n 'you ought not/cannot make it', also
functionally an imperative ""do not make it!"". A basic distinction exists between negative
predications which negate a predicate of indicative mood, versus those which negate a
predicate of irrealis mood. For the present tense, the difference may be illustrated by the
contrast between wonggo (or warna) nganja Ί am not going', the negative of the
indicative form nganja Ί am going' (this instant, or imminently), versus wonggoAvama
yi-nganja Ί may not/cannot/ought not go'. All of the glossed non-indicative modalities
are expressed formally with the irrealis markers (i.e., first position prefix/es and
appropriate pronominal adjuncts (see 6.7.3.).
                                               Clausal particles, conjunctions and interjections 301  The same contrast may exist in the past, between negated indicative forms (""did not
X"") and irrealis (""would/could not have""). Thus, wonggo and wama are simply negators,
while modality is signalled by the (indicative or irrealis) form of the predicate. Examples
of the negative particles — first wonggo, then wama — follow with commentary.(744) yinyang           wonggo              yi-marnany-garang
      2SG-ABS           neg                 YI-husband-having-ABS
       'You do not have a husband'.
  (744) illustrates a negative predication (with zero copula) of a ""having"" construction

 (746) contrasts with the negation of an indicative predicate, wonggo nu-bu-n 'you are
not killing it'.(747) dan-mulu          wonggo      mugurn           yi-ngan-burr-marnbu-n

       Ί don't always/often see them two of them, no'.
  (748) illustrates the negation of an habitual form, along with the interjection ngawun
'no, nothing, none', which is often used as complement to predications of negative
import.(749) wonggo ya-yi-ginye-n            wonggo                     ya-yi-marn-bu-n

       'She is incapable of cooking/doesn't cook, she doesn't make a fire, she just
       comes looking for cooked food'.
302 Chapter 12  Note that the formulation of the meaning of (749) is not by means of the negation of
an indicative predication, but rather by use of an irrealis verb form which signals
incapacity and/or habit of not doing something, and is thus more than the simple negation
of an indicative assertion ""she is making fire"" etc.(750) wonggo            ngawun-wo-ndi
      neg                lSG/3NSG-give-PST
        Ί didn't give them [any]'.(751) wonggo            ngarrug           ngarr-we-ndi
      neg               1INPL-ABS         UNPL-fall-PST
        'We were not born'.
  (751) illustrates that an emphatic or contrastive independent pronoun may separate
negator and predicate.(752)   galgalba-ya        nu-born-ma              wonggo             yi-dodba-ya

        'You bathe in shallow water, not in deep water'.
 (752) illustrates wonggo as negator of a nominal phrase (see 10.6.).(753) burrjib       nga-gurrgba-rri      wonggo              ngawun-wojbarna-rri

        'You mustn't swear at me, I'm not your WIFE, I'm your niece'.
  In (754), the second occurrence of wonggo negates the predication ""I am your wife"",
with zero copula of being. In such a construction, the independent pronoun cannot be
seen as contrastive, for it is the only means by which person-number can be expressed
in the absence of a finite verb.(755)   wonggo ngayugu          nganu-gomarla-n               yibiwi

  (758) illustrates the possibility of negation of an habitual predicate; a more idiomatic
English translation would be ""you don't ever listen to me"".
  All the examples above have been of wonggo. The following provide a range of similar
examples with wama.(759) warna       yi-wama-gari             yibiwan               yanja

 In (763), the very same particle plus finite verb expression is negated successively with
wonggo and then \varna.(764) warna      yinggiya        0-jingi-ndi        go                 ngawun

"
8.9. Irrealis categories of the verbAs noted in 8.2., Irrealis mood marking co-occurs with Present and Past tense suffixation,
and also with zero-stem forms. For those verbs which have a distinctive Future stem,
this is the zero-stem form that occurs with Irrealis.
  It is also important to clarify the relation of negative forms of the verb to Irrealis.
Negations of Indicative predications are not Irrealis. Negatives such as ""I did not go"", ""I
am not going"" etc., are inflectionally the same as the corresponding Indicative forms,
negated either with negative particle wonggo or (less frequently) warna (see 12.2.5.).
However, certain kinds of negations are typically Irrealis. With Present-suffixation and
negative particle, Irrealis forms express meanings including prohibition and constraint
""may not, cannot, not able to"", etc. With Past-suffixation, negative Irrealis forms express
counterfactual meanings, ""would not have, ought not to have"", and the like. All of these
inflectional possibilities with Irrealis are exemplified.",[208]

My thorough-going obligation to Wardaman people of Katherine, Northern Territory, as
well as my debt to some researchers who studied languages of this area before me, is
described in 1.5 of the following grammar. Here I would like to acknowledge support
for the funding of my research, and my gratitude to fellow researchers.
  My first period of research in Katherine, from 1976 to 1979, during which I did
considerable work with Wardaman people, was funded by the Australian Institute of
Aboriginal Studies, now the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Studies, Canberra. I am particularly grateful to Warwick Dix for having overseen many
aspects of field support.
  In 1988 and 1989,1 was invited by Josephine Flood, then at the Australian Heritage
Commission, to take part in interdisciplinary research on Aboriginal sites of Willeroo,
Delamere and Innesvale Stations. Permission to visit those properties became easier to
obtain in the late 1980s than it had been before. As a result, I was able to expand my
familiarity with Wardaman country considerably. I was able to visit not only rock art
sites (the focus of research by archaeologists) but also many other Wardaman sites of
significance which I had been learning about for some years from Wardaman people.
  For discussion of Australian languages and many other matters over the years, I would
like to especially acknowledge Paul Black, Jeffrey Heath, Pat McConvell, David Nash,
and Alan Rumsey. I am indebted to Georg Bossong for his useful editorial suggestions
on an earlier draft of this manuscript, especially for his comments on analysis of the
pronominal categories (Chaptero), and his encouragement to expand the analysis of word
order (Chapter 10). Lorraine Garland, Mark Harvey, Stephen Roberts, and Karen
Westmacott were invaluable assistants in the preparation of this manuscript. My thanks
also to the Cartography section of the Department of Geography at the University of
Sydney for preparation of maps.

                                     Introduction
1.1. Wardaman today: The language and its speakers Wardaman is a non-Pama Nyungan language of the upper, inland Northern Territory of
Australia. It is now one of the most widely spoken Aboriginal languages of Katherine, a
rapidly-growing1 town of about 8000 people located on the Stuart Highway in the upper
third of the Northern Territory (Map 1). Though Wardaman is more widely known than
some of the other languages of the general Katherine area, the number of active speakers
is relatively small. I estimate there are 30 people aged 40 and above who live in and
around Katherine, and regularly speak Wardaman in some of their interactions with each
other. They do not speak only Wardaman to each other and to other Aboriginal people
with whom they live, but also use north Australian Kriol (see Sandefur 1979) and other
Aboriginal languages.
  Additionally, there is a much larger number of people — possibly numbering as many
as two hundred — with and around whom those active speakers live, and in many cases,
have lived for a long period of time, who understand Wardaman and consider hearing it
spoken around them a regular feature of their lives. Many of these additional people are
close family of the ""core"" speakers, children, grandchildren, and others. Some others,
however, tend to be more distantly related ""countrymen"" of the Wardaman — people
who identify with tribal groupings of Victoria and Daly Rivers and the larger region west
and south of Katherine, contiguous with what the Wardaman regard as their traditional
territory. These countrymen include people who are identified as Jaminjung, Yangman
and Mudbura, among other tribal groupings. Many of these people have been in the
Katherine area for a long time, and some are married to Wardaman. Additional
countrymen from the Victoria River hinterland, who identify with tribal groupings
including Ngarinyman, Nungali and Ngaliwurru, often visit the Katherine camps and
houses where Wardaman people live when they come in to town. (See Map 2 showing
approximate territorial association of the tribal groupings mentioned). Some of the older
countrymen not only understand Wardaman, but can speak it, even if they do not do so
as often as the Wardaman core speakers.
  Younger Wardaman people — in my observation, including at least everyone born after
the Second World War — do not speak the language actively, but use at most the
occasional word and phrase. Varying with family, however, some of these younger
people have a good understanding of the language. Due to the particular circumstances
1. The town had continued to grow steadily but slowly until 1986, when the recommissioning of
a RAAF base east of the town, Tindal. was the impetus for the rapid near-doubling of the town's
population. Under these conditions, and despite considerable Aboriginal movement into the town
in the 1960s. 1970s, and 1980s, there has been diminution of the proportion of the town's people
who are Aborigines.
2 Chapter 1under which many Wardaman have lived for the last few decades (see 1.4.), many
younger people of certain families have had a great deal of influential exposure to
Wardaman, and have a rather full, passive knowledge of the language which apparently
might, under some conditions, be convertible into active speakership.
  Thus active use of Wardaman is more closely associated with age among Victoria River
and allied ""countrymen"" than it is simply with social identification as Wardaman.
Tendency to use the language, however, seems to be strongly correlated both with age
and with recognition of Wardaman as one's ""own"" language (see Sutton 1978).
  Wardaman people now mainly live around and in Katherine town, although some
people who either identify themselves as Wardaman, or consider that identity a major
component of their family background, live on stations and in other places in the Victoria
River region (including Killarney, Kildurk, and Bulla Stations, Wave Hill, and Yarralin).
  Wardaman are concentrated at two camps outside of Katherine, to the south and west,
towards their traditional country. These are Binjara (Bunjarri\ a community on
Manbulloo Station about 12 kms. from Katherine on the Victoria Highway; and The
Rockhole, about 10 kms outside of town on the Fiorina Road (see Map 3). Increasingly,
some Wardaman people occupy houses in the town, and some people move back and
forth between the camps outside of town, and relatives' houses in town, with one or the
other locale being the normal residence and the other a place where they may spend
shorter periods, a day or perhaps a few days at a time. Wardaman is spoken at Binjara,
Rockhole, and in the town at Wardaman-occupied houses and in the course of activity
(e.g., shopping) in town. Given the close proximity of the two major camps, one or
(usually) more vehicles will commute between them and the town, once or (often) more
times per day. Visiting among Wardaman in and around town is very frequent, and a
major daily activity for many.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"12.5.5. Nganayu 'let it be, no'The word nganayu consists of Hortative prefix ngana- (8.8.), and the copula root VH-;
thus, literally 'let it be'. It is used in that etymological sense, that is, as predicator:(840)   gila        wiya-yi        merleng           minyardin-biji          ngana-yu
        douse       water-INST      flame-ABS        charcoal-ABS-only       HT-3SG-be
        'Douse the flame with water, let only charcoal be [there]'.
  Nganayu is also used in a way that is more loosely linked to its etymology, i.e. as
interjection expressing dislike, disapproval or otherwise negation on the part of the
speaker, and better glossed simply as 'No [I won't]' or 'No [I don't like it]', as in the
following sort of exchange:(841) A:         ngarr-ya         gangga-rlan
                 UNPL-go          upriver-ALL
        B:       nganayu          ( wu -munbu rra -wagbawun)
                 no                WU-money-lacking-ABS
        A:        'Let's go to town' [upriver].
        B:       'No [I won't, I don't want to] (no money/I have no money)'.
  Thus nganayu may be a negative response to a predication, often as above a proposal,
and may be taken to express 'let it be' concerning what is predicated. The person ""not
liking"" is assumed to be the speaker, unless otherwise indicated. There is an explicit
means for placing person in relation to this form, by means of the dative pronoun series:
nganayu nganu Ί don't like it', nganayu yinggi 'you don't like it', nganayu wurrugu
'they don't like it', and so forth. It is possible to form a complement in which the person
""not liking"" is also the agent of the action, with particle or nominalized verb form and
the case suffix -warr:(842)   nganayu            nganu           ya-yi-warr
        let it be          ISO-DAT         go-NOM-ALL
        'I don't want to go'.
  If, however, another person is agent of the action, a negative irrealis verb form is used
in a distinct clause:
                                              Clausal particles, conjunctions and interjections 327
(843) nganayu         wonggo           ya-yi-0-nyja

      'No, he mayn't go' = Ί don't want him to go'.","[350, 351]"
"11.1.3. Negative imperative particle constructionsPositive imperatives are not ordinarily formed using the particle alone (as is apparently
the case in Wakiman, see Cook 1987:255). Thus, one usually orders someone, notduba
'sit down!' with particle alone, but dubajingi 'sit down!', with particle plus finite verb.
While the particle may occur by itself as imperative, this apparently has the quality of a
truncated or elliptical utterance.
  Negative imperatives of particle plus finite verb constructions may be formed as usual,
that is, such constructions are identical to the Present Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms:(646)    wonggo         duba      yi-ni-jingi-n
        neg             sit       IRR-2SG-AUX-PRES
        'Don't sit down!' 'You must not sit down!'.
                                              Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 267  However, negative imperatives may be formed with particles alone, without any
nominal arguments, by suffixation of -gay ~ -way to the particle. These are apparently
rather forceful in tone, perhaps equivalent to the German past participial imperative
construction: Aufgestanden! The form is very rare in text material collected. Informants
produced elicitation examples both with and without the particle suffix:(647)   balyagbalyag-gay           nu-waja
        touch rdp-PNEG             2NSG-leave
        'No touching, you [NSG] leave him alone'.
  Note that the fact that the particle itself cannot be inflected for person means that,
though the addressees in (647) are nonsingular in the finite imperative form ""leave him!"",
number of the addressee is not specified in the particle. The force of the particle negator
appears to be to negate the action designated by the particle as a whole, ""No touching"".(648)   jajay-ma-way
        weak-PS-PNEG
        'No weakness!' 'Don't be weak!'.(649)   ngarral-ma-way
        shout-PS-PNEG
        'No shouting!' 'Don't shout!'.
  See 9.3. for the negation of nominalized finite verbs.","[290, 291]"
"12.5.3. Yawe 'yes'The affirmative yawe is used either to answer a question posed by someone else, or (as
also in English) to create a cohesive link within the text of a single speaker, by signalling
that the text is about to proceed. Examples of both kinds follow. In the first, yawe is used
within the text of a single speaker to represent a response in a narrated speech situation.
In this segment of text, narrated by Elsie Raymond, she represents her grandmother as
telling her a story of an early massacre; and herself, as listener many years ago, asking
""Is that right?"", to which her grandmother replies, ""Yes"".(835) yin.gun-bu-ndi-ya           dan-ganung-ba                galul

   E        ""Is that right?""
   G:     ""Yes. Later, when you get big you tell them the story now'"".
  The second kind of function is not ""response"" either in the immediate speech situation
or in a narrated one, but is a way in which the speaker carries the narrative flow forward
and creates cohesion within the text.(836) 0-yanggi           lurrbu    bordordob        0-gengnu-yi-rri     na

        'He went galloping back home, he was afraid, to the
        station, that white man. Yes,
        they went away from him now that way, and disappeared'.","[348, 349]"
"8.9.1. Admonitive (zero-stem) irrealis constructionsAll examples immediately following have at least one instance of Irrealis-marked zero-
stem form. This is generally used, as the examples show, to express something which
might happen, the usual (but not invariable) implication being that the event or action so
designated is undesirable and ought to be avoided, whether or not this is explicitly stated.

  In (410) the Irrealis verb form yi-ngarr-gurl-mi shows the Future stem form gurl-mi-
of the verb gun-ma- 'lose, forget, forgo', and the like. The particle bujun often occurs
in the protasis of conditional clauses, there translatable as 'if; but as the example shows,
bujun may occur simply in ""admonitive"" clauses expressing that something undesirable
may happen. In some uses of this kind, it is best translatable as ""lest"" (see further 12.2.2.).
(411) exhibits the Irrealis form ""they might see me"", with zero-stem. The verb na- 'see'
has no distinctive Future stem form (despite its a vocalism).
186 Chapters  (412) illustrates the Future stem form of the verb ""to go"" in this semantically admonitive
construction, ""lest the sun go down"" or ""before the sun goes down"". Compare (417)
below.
  (413) has ""he might burn"" with zero stem (again, ba- 'bum, thirst' has no distinctive
Future stem).
  (414) illustrates two different kinds of Irrealis-marked constructions. The first, a
negated Predicate with Present-tense marking, expresses the modal meaning ""you should
not"" (pick up the baby); this kind of form, not distinct from the negative imperative, is
further illustrated below. The second form, mum-trie is a zero stem-form, the clause in
which it occurs expressing the undesirability of the action designated by the Irrealis
predicate.
  (415) and (416) further illustrate the semantically admonitive usage of the zero-stem
forms with gi- as auxiliary, and gwi-ngu- as main verbal constituent. In this irrealis
construction, the undergoer is marked as intransitive 2NSG subject (but see e.g., 416).
  (412) above illustrated the Future stem form of 'go' (-nyji) in an admonitive clausal
construction. This may be compared with (417) which has an Irrealis Present form, i.e.,
with stem not distinct from the present indicative. Here possibility does not have the
admonitive component that the action predicated is undesirable. But (418) is once again
semantically of the type of (412), and here we find use of the Future stem.(417) yilama            yayinyja      niayinyja      wurritgu           ngarlg-ba

      break IRR3-AUX                2SG-DAT

  (419), on the other hand, illustrates use first, of Present-suffixed Irrealis to express
possibility, followed by a zero-suffixed form expressing undesirable action:(419) yijarlu           yilama-gan         yayi-wud-janga-n               yayi-wurr-nie

8.9.2. Negative present irrealis, negative imperativesThe most common occurrence of Irrealis, Present-suffixed forms is in clauses negated
with particle wonggo, or alternatively warna, and expressing modal meanings of
impossibility, prohibition, or constraint.

explicit pronominal) introduced by yilama-gan is ironic, 'Maybe I look nice?'

"8.2. Overview of tense-aspect-mood categoriesA main contrast within the system of verbal categories is that between Indicative and
Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms. Indicative forms are those in which there is no explicit
qualification of the reality or eventuality of that which is designated by the predicate;
Irrealis forms are those which are overtly so qualified. The distinction must be seen as
one which is tailored to the linguistic categories, however, for not all Indicative forms
designate ""real"" events. They are used rather to make predicate meanings in a way that
involves no explicit qualification of the factuality or eventuality of what the predicate
designates.
  The Indicative categories are Present, Past, Future and Potential, each of which is
described and illustrated in a separate section below. Each category is marked by one or
more allomorphs, and the tense-mood-aspect categories in the language overall are highly
regular and show little variation. The Present, Future and Potential forms have non-past
ya- in first position within the inflecting verb in 'third person' forms, i.e., in those where
the sole pronominal adjunct is third person, and in those in which both subject and object
are third persons (see 6.6.). This initial non-past, third person prefix in the non-past
categories contrasts with zero in the same position in the Past forms of the verb, e.g.,
yanggun-bu-n 'he is hitting them', versus wunggun-bu-ndi 'he hit them'.
  As a whole, the Indicative mood contrasts with Irrealis mood. Irrealis is directly
signalled by first-position prefix(es) in the verb, in general yayi- for 'third person' forms
(as above), and yi- for non-third person forms. There are also some differences from
Indicative forms in person-marking pronominals (6.6.3. for further details). Irrealis
prefixation may co-occur both with Present and Past tense marking, and further, with a
zero-stem form, i.e., one with no explicit tense-aspect suffixation. Irrealis prefixation
with Present forms of the verb expresses modal meanings of the sort ""ought to"", and with
negative particles (either wonggo or warna, 12.2.5.), meanings 'should not', and 'cannot'
(either inability or physical and/or social constraint). Negative Imperatives in Wardaman
(8.9.2.) are not formally distinguished from such forms. Irrealis prefixation with Past
tense marking expresses past counterfactual meanings ""meant to"", ""ought to have"", and
the like. Irrealis prefixation with zero-stem expresses mere possibility ""may, might"" (and
contrasts with Potential, which expresses eventuality but without qualification of the
reality of the event designated by the predicate). A particular use of the Irrealis zero-stem
forms is in what may be called ""admonitive"" constructions, often best translated by use
of English ""lest"". There will be some illustration in this chapter of all of these forms and
uses, and forward reference to discussion of conditional and other constructions in
following chapters.
176 Chapter 8  Most verbs in Wardaman have an invariable stem to which inflectional endings are
added. Some, however, show a distinctive Future stem form, that is, a stem to which
Future suffix is added. For those verbs which have distinctive Future stem, this is also
found in Irrealis zero-suffix forms, i.e. with Irrealis prefixation and zero suffixation to
the stem, to express mere possibility, and also in the admonitive semantic construction
type mentioned above.
  The verbs which have distinctive Future stem are all ones with final stem-vowel a: all
those verbs with final syllable -ma ~ -ba, as well asyana- 'say, do', nyanga- 'come', and
the irregular ya- 'go'. (Not all stems with final a, however, have a distinctive Future
stem; for example, la- 'to bite', ga- 'to take', ba- 'to burn', do not). To exemplify the
relation between the regular and Future stem, and the Irrealis form with zero suffix, we
can take the verb nyanga-: Present 3SG form ya-0-nyanga-n, PUT ya-0-nyangi-we, and
zero-suffixed Irrealis form yayi-0-nyangi 'lest he come'. The vowel of the regular stem
is a, that of the Future stem, i (following which the Future suffix -wa becomes -we). In
this sharing of stem by Future and (one of the) Irrealis paradigmatic forms, we see some
indication of the historical nature of the Future as a sub-category of Irrealis mood. From
this we may assume that the generalization of the -wa as Future suffix is a later
development in the language, and that stem alternation is a relic of an earlier, somewhat
different organization of tense-mood categories.
  The Positive Imperative (8.7.) is neither Indicative nor Irrealis. ""Hortative"" (8.8.)
constitutes a semantic category of forms of urging (""let us go"", ""may he go"" etc.), but
the first-position prefix complex is distinctive only in third person forms. Otherwise, the
prefix complex is not distinguished from that found in Indicative forms.
  There is an Habitual verbal category (8.10.), which has been found to occur only with
Present-tense suffixation on the verb, and may also have additionally non-past
subordinate suffixation. As noted in 6.6.4., formally the Habitual prefix complex has
much in common with the Irrealis mood category, but there is no reason to see Habitual
synchronically as a sub-category of Irrealis. Final sections of this chapter describe
reflexive-reciprocal marking, minor aspectual categories of the verb (marked by outer
suffixes), and subordinate marking. There is also a discussion of the paradigm of the
highly irregular verb ""to go"".","[199, 200]"
"12.4.1. (Tag) question: AleThere is a question element ale (see Cook 1987:93 for the form ngale in Wakiman) which
is usually final in relation to what is questioned, and thus usually a ""tag"" question marker.
In general, it follows a statement of some kind, and, in the same speaking ""turn"", directs
the addressee to confirm or deny the correctness of the speaker's statement. However, it
may be used not by the original speaker, but in a different turn, to question whether what
the speaker said is correct, and in this usage it is thus not a ""tag"", but a more independent
question element (see example (828) in 12.5.3.). It may follow a positive or negative
statement, but tends to occur after the former; positive statements followed by request
for confirmation are more common than negative ones. It may be glossed 'is that right?'
or'is that so'?
  In the first example below, ale is used text-internally. That is, it is not a request for
confirmation directed by the speaker to another person sitting with us in the immediate
320 Chapter 12
speech situation at the time the material was recorded, but rather a question directed by
the speaker of the narrated speech situation, a European policeman, to an Aboriginal
woman, the speaker's sister. The story being told to me by the speaker and another
woman, in turns, was about how European policeman used to come check up whether
there were any part-Aboriginal children living in camps, and if there were, they used to
remove them to institutions. A policeman came to check up, and found a part-Aboriginal
child in the speaker's family.(816) yinyigben        0-nyanga-ndi              0-na-rri

"11.1.2. Particle suffix -ba ~ -maThe particle suffix may be freely added to members of this word class which otherwise
end in a consonant, e.g., ban.garrg or ban.garrg-ba 'fall, pitch down, headlong',
bulmarrab or bulmarrab-(b)a 'float', lorn 'peel, strip' and lorn-ma, etc. It may also be
264 Chapter 11
suffixed to some members of the class here called adverbs, e.g., bone and borle-ma
 'across', malang and malang-ma 'cross, across', etc.
   There is a no doubt etymologically related suffix -ma in Wakiman, which Cook
(1987: 235) describes as implementing aspectual differences in the particle class (or
""participles"", as he terms them). In fact, there he recognizes four aspectual participial
forms: aspectually ""unmarked"" (with suffix -ma for many members of the class);
Punctual, reduced in some way compared to the ""unmarked"" form, and involving zeroing
of-ma for some participles; Sequential with suffix -wi; and Purposive, which is generally
built on the ""unmarked"" stem form by addition of y-gu. Cook (1987: 232) notes that
participles in Wakiman can occur alone without nominal arguments as imperative
utterances, and it would seem (ibid: 255) that such imperative function generally (or
invariably?) involves use of the aspectually ""Punctual"" forms, and not the ""unmarked""
ones.
   In contrast, in Wardaman although the alternation between zero-suffixed and -ba ~ -ma
suffixed particles is ubiquitous, no such clear aspectual difference can be discerned in
the alternation, and indeed no perspicuous grammatical distinction can be associated with
it. One piece of evidence of the difference between Wakiman and Wardaman comes from
the fact that the overtly suffixed particles are freely used in imperative constructions, as
the following examples show:(632)   \vird-ba         ga        yi-nebel-ya
        carry up-PS      AUX       YI-shoulder-LOC
        'Carry it on your shoulder!'.
  The locative phrase seems redundant, given that wird is usually understood to mean
'carry on shoulder' without additional qualification.(633)   gud-ba            me

        'Do not touch it'.
  (639) illustrates the retention of the particle suffix in a negative imperative construction.
One might expect this to be less an issue in the negative imperative, because of the fact
that it is not formally distinct from the Irrealis Present.
  Elsewhere, in other tense-aspect-mood forms of the verb, the presence or absence of
the particle suffix equally seems not to be associable with a categorial difference. The
following are (elicited) examples of suffixed and suffix-less forms, alleged to be
interpreted in the same way:(638)    wonggo           worlog/worlog-ba              ya-0-bu-n                        gunga

         'They stood up their spears and ate their food in the shade'.
 Although not all of the predicate meanings in these examples can be seen as aspectually
punctual, there are some that seem undoubtedly so, e.g., (642), and with respect to these
266 Chapter 11
informants seem to not make a distinction between the suffixed and unsuffixed particle
forms. This alternation extends also to members of the word class that are general enough
that they might equally be termed adverbs, viz.:(643) menbalu-wa      0-nyanga-ndi                   borle/borle-ma     dan-garr yimerrug

        'The spirit came across from Manbulloo to here'.
 Compare (644) and (645), both of which seem to designate actions of semantically
punctual aspect:(644)   wu-dab-(b)a         werr-ma         0-bu-ndi
        WU-cave-ABL         out-PS          3SG-AUX-PST
        'He came out of/emerged from the cave'.(645)   barnam         0-jingi-ndi     gunga        jimirndi-warra bornborn-ba
        lie in wait    3SG-AUX-PST    3SG-DAT       knife-ADV       bathe-ABL

        3SG-DAT knife-ABS
        'She lay in wait for him with a knife, he came naked from the shower and the
        knife came out [from] his back'.
  In short, whatever the function of the alternation may have been historically, it seems
not to be associable with a difference between grammatical categories now. Any
supposed levelling of a previous grammatical difference may have to do with the wide
distribution of the -ba ~ -ma verb class in the contemporary lexicon, where the suffix is
re-interpreted as a mark of predicate function per se, and not of contrast within the system
of verbal categories.","[287, 288, 289, 290]"
"12.5.7. Ngala, emphatic confirmationThe conjunction ngala (12.3.3.) signals a break in relation to previous text. It may be
either strongly adversative, equivalent to English ""but""; or less strongly so, and often
understood as a topic-changing ""but what about?"".
  There is a further interjectional use of ngala, as emphatic confirmation in response to
a question. In the instances attested the polarity of such questions has been positive, as
in the following exchange in which a woman speaker was recounting the taking away of
her sister's child by a welfare officer to the writer and another woman, B:(844) A:       wurr-gelewu-rri     wurren    nganinggin   jongon                   glla

       B:       'Did she cry for him?'
       A:      'And howlTYes indeed!'
  The break normally signalled by ngala applies interpersonally, within the speech
situation, to create the most emphatic kind of confirmatory response. There is no
necessary implication on the part of the respondent A that B thought the sister did NOT
cry; rather, the sense is simply one of forceful confirmation.",[351]
"
8.20. Copula verbs
  Two finite verbs function as copulas, jingi- and yu-. The former is also a full lexical
verb ""sit"" (and may also occur with particle duba in this meaning). In many instances
copular kinds of constructions in Wardaman do not involve the use of any finite verb.
                                                                Categories of the finite verb 213For example, as noted in 5.7., semantically adjectival nominate may occur with article
suffix forming complements, the subject of which is understood from the pronominal
adjunct of a proximate finite verb:(512)   wudu-wi                   nganburr-ga-ndi...
        little-ABS-ART            3NSG/lSG-take-PST
        'When I was little they took me ...'
  The verb yu- is less common tYianjingi-, both in predications of being and existence
(in a place), and in particle plus verb combinations. This is related to its being defective.
As noted in 8.16., it has only present tense form yu- and non-past subordinate form
yungga, forms ofjingi- occurring elsewhere. It also has a reduplicative present tense
form, yuju-. Besides serving (rarely) as copula, yu-, is also found as supporting verb in
a number of particle plus finite verb combinations. Any particle which may occur with
yu- may also occur withy wg/-, although certain particles (see below) preferentially occur
with yu- in the Present tense. In a few combinations with particle it seems that the verb
may sometimes express the meaning of ""lie"", or (with inanimate clausal subjects) ""be on
the ground"", but this semantic element is certainly not evident in many combinations.
  Particles with which yu- has been recorded in combination include: geleng 'shine, be
shiny'; lirrngang-ma 'smile, laugh'; mengmeng-ma 'be an expanse, spread out, cover,
be in flower' (typically used of expanses of water or flat plains, and in the last sense of
plants); mirrng-ma 'have a headache'; ngarralang-ma 'stand poised, with paws up';
ngidgid-ba 'whimper'; \varrba 'rest'; word-bo, 'sit with head out, only head visible';
narrangarl-ma 'protrude, stick up';juba 'be deaf; gunurd-ba 'be glad'.

                    Other aspects of word formation
9.1. Introduction: Historical layersThere remain a few significant aspects of word, and mainly nominal, morphology to be
discussed in this chapter. Some of these are isolated, or attested in only a few forms (like
the prefix nya-, see 9.6.), and may be assumed to be remnants of old processes of word
formation, now fairly marginal. Others, however, like nominal formation with the suffix
•ban ~ -man, are not only clearly old, but were thorough-going in the language, as the
large number of relatable forms attests.
9.2. -ban ~ -war/, adjectival suffixA nominal-forming suffix of reasonably frequent occurrence is -ban ~ -wan, which is
attested suffixed both to verb particles/adverbs and to nominals, creating derived forms
which are either semantically adjectival, and/or characterized by perfective passive
meaning. This ending is only moderately productive.
  Some forms with this suffix include: burrgburrg-bari 'piebald, spotted'; nyabnyab-
(b)ari 'sticky' (from nyab); walig-bari 'around, all around' (from adverbial walig
'around'); gorlorlogba-wari 'straight' (related to gorlorlogba 'straight'); gun.garr-wari
'what type?' 'what kind?' (cf. gun.garr-ma, 7.5.5.); derrema-wari 'crawling, crawler'
from the particle derre-ma; and yarralma-wari 'untidy, unkempt' (related to particle
yarralma, 'stand up, be unkempt, untidy').
  Sometimes the suffix derives a form of a different word class from the base form, e.g.,
nyabnyab-(b)ari 'sticky' is derived from particle nyab-(b)a 'to stick to'; and yarralma-
wari 'unkempt' from particle yarralma 'to be unkempt'. However, sometimes
suffixation does not clearly result in a change in word class, e.g., compare:(517a)    walig         yanja               gunya              ye-0-geng-ma
          around        3SG-go-PRES         3SG-DISS           3-3SG-fear-PRES(517b)    walig-bari              yanja               gunya              ye-0-geng-ma

         'He's going around away from him, he fears him'.
  In such instances there is little clear ground for describing the suffix as ""nominalizing""
(or indeed, as ""derivational""), since the resulting form has the same possibilities of
occurrence as the base form. Note also gorlorlogban 'straight' and gorlorlogba-wari
'straight' are equally descriptors. There is seemingly a difference in syntactic flexibility
of regular nominal constructions as compared to these: those with -ban ~ -wari are not
216 Chapter 9commonly attested with case suffocation (although inquiry reveals that informants
consider case-suffixed forms of them acceptable).
  The subtly more nominal character of gun.garr-wari as compared togun.garr-nia may
be appreciated from the fact that the latter may be used to question the manner of action,
""how?"". It may, however, also be used to ask about the nature of something, e.g.,
gun.garr-im tmdin 'what's the word?' 'what's the news?' etc. Gun.garr-wari, on the
other hand, is used only as adnominal interrogative:(518)   gej-ba        nga-gi-ndi        nuilurru
        ask-PS        1SG-AUX-PST       old woman-ABS

        Ί asked the old lady
        ""Auntie? What sort of thing is niagitlu?""
        ""Here here come, I'll show you"" '.
  Two different kinds of textual occurrences of -ban are worth citing to further illustrate
its functional range. In a text about bushlore, the speaker is describing plants which
Aborigines used to collect and use for fish poisons. Allative forms of ""here"" and ""that
way"" are found suffixed as follows:(519)   menjen         nianda-gan          geler ruga
        [plant]        what-Q              [plant]
        dann-rlan-bari
        here-AI^NGM
        dawu-rlan-bari            gelerrnga
        that way-AUy-NOM          [plant]
        'Barringtonia and what's-it Strychnos
         towards this way
          and that way Strychnos'.
  Here, -ban seems to make more concrete the notion of a region or area in the direction
indicated, and thus a nominalizing sort of value.
  In another text the speaker talks of evil glances, or ""evil eye"", which might keep a
pregnant woman from delivering her child easily and in good time. She describes such
a woman as follows:(520) yi-birrba     bangbun        nana
      YI-old-ABS    woman-ABS      that-ABS
      burruga-wun-bari     gayawun-bi
      long ago-NOM-NOM while-AKT
        ' That is an ""old"" woman [' old' =one pregnant for a time already]
          a long-term one, still a while [to go] ...'.
                                                            Other aspects of word formation 217
  Here the suffix occurs on burruga-, which usually occurs with article suffix as
burruga-wi in the meaning 'a long time ago, a long while, long before'. Although
seemingly essentially adverbial, burruga- is here suffixed with what looks like
nominal-forming -gim ~-wun (see 9.4.), but which may also be analyzed as a reduced
form of the Source case ending - wunba, which has been contracted with the ending -ban,
producing a form meaning 'a long-term (person)'.
  Examples of this suffix with v ;rb particles, which show the perfective passive semantic
most clearly, include: iromdog-ba 'split, halve, cut', dog-bari 'halved, split one'; from
bag-ba 'break', bag-ban 'broten one'; from dorlb-(b)a 'drop', dorlb-(b)ari 'dropped
one'; from dulyurr-nm' break, Irnrst', diilyurrma-wari' burst one'. From nominals, note
also the following derivations: from wengman 'empty', wengnian-bari 'emptied, empty,
having been emptied5; iromja.nam 'fuu',jamam-bari 'full, filled one'; and related to
both verb particle jubad 'be diaf' and adjectival nominal yi-jubad 'deaf', jubad-bari
'deaf, deafened one'. Such derived forms do not occur with nominal class prefixes
(though they are, as noted abo\ e, acceptable with case endings). They tend to occur in
absolutive form, for example:(521)   dog-ban          nganu-wo-n
        split-NOM        2NSG/lSG-give-PRES
        ' Give me the halved ons/give me that bit'.
93. -man ~ -ban, nominal-forming suffixThere are many nominals in Wiirdaman that have a final syllable -man or -ban, which is
discussed in 11.1.2., and seems to be relatable to the particle suffix -ba ~ -ma. This
suggestion is supported by the fact that from a considerable number of particles, nominals
can be derived by the additio:i of the noun-forming -n (the same element which is
commonly deleted in final syllable reduction, see 3.4.): for example, from particle
bilili-nra 'be slippery' is derivei the nominal bililiman 'slippery', and so forth.
  This seems indicative of forner, highly productive derivational processes in which
many roots could variably function as verb particles, or as nominals, the former
seemingly morphologically basic. In the contemporary language, however, there are
large numbers of nominals ending in -ntan or -ban that cannot be related to any verb
particle. It is possible that corresponding verb particles, or at least some, may have
formerly existed but have dropped out of the lexicon, and that along with this went the
thorough installation in the hinguage of -man ~ -ban as part of an historical, but
decreasingly productive, structure of nominal formatioa
  The suffix -man ~ -ban occirs as part of the nominal suffix -gujban - -wujban (see
11.3.1.), but there is a clear encugh semantic contrast between the former and the latter.
The latter suffix is very produc live especially with a large range of finite verb roots and
verb particles in the formation of agentive nominals, i.e., ones that generally designate
""agent that does X"", where X is an activity (e.g., bu-yi-wujban 'fighter' from bit-;
nyerreng-ma-wujban 'noise-maker' from nyerreng-ma 'make noise', and so on). In
218 Chapter 9 contrast, the former suffix is found in all sorts of nominal stems which designate either
 non-agentive substantives, conditions, and the like (dalbirrman 'tough, hard', goyogban
  Orphan', langman 'plain, clear place', wujaban 'house', megerrman 'long yam',
 ngigilman 'straight, wabulman 'light-weight', etc.); or occurs in a large range of animal
 and other natural species terms. Some of the latter are clearly onomatopoetic, but the
 character of the formation, in contrast to that with -gujban ~ -wujban, seems not agentive
 but rather descriptive of inherent quality or characteristic (which may include typical
 noise or sound made). Among such forms are: nilngman 'finch', gorrgorrman
 'kookaburra', jerrman 'wrens', jibilyuman 'whistle duck', jorrerrngman 'kingfisher',
jorlborrman 'butcher bird'. See however also: burariman 'bluetongue' (dry country);
 gurrbljlnman 'python'; and even gangman 'plains kangaroo', where natural species
 terms are clearly not imitative. There is as yet no sustainable etymology for the suffix
 -gujban ~ -wujban.
   A more complete listing of nominals with this ending includes: ngarraban 'hot';
 ngirringirriban 'greedy'; ngunagban Odiferous'; nidban, insect similar to cicada;
 nyorijban, unidentified bird; goyogban Orphan'; warrgban 'ubiquitous, promiscuous,
 all over the place'; welejban 'parrot'; (mu)-wudban 'wet ground'; wujaban 'house,
 humpy'; ylberrgoban 'pigeon-toed'; derreman ' c r a w l e r ' ; belejejeman, small
 grasshopper; belyengman 'red'; berlerlman 'kerosene tree'; bilangman 'sweet';
 bilillman 'slipper'; meleman 'black'; burariman, central blue-tongue; dalbirrman 'hard,
 tough'; darlarlman 'sated, satisfied'; demdetnan 'locust'; denggerrengman 'empty';
gangman 'plains kangaroo'; gelegeleman 'frightened'; gerregerrewuman, unidentified
 bird; gorrgorrman 'kookaburra'; gurrbijinman 'children's python';jajayman 'weak';
jamunyman 'pertaining to mother's father's country'; jerrman 'wrens'; jeyeman
 'promised spouse'-Jibilyuman 'whistleduck';jorlborrman 'butcherbird'; jorrerrngman
 'kingfisher';jurlman 'pocket'; langman 'plain, clear place'; megerrman 'long yam';
 worroman 'quick, fast'; newerrman 'hungry'; ngaringgirrman 'round, circular';
ngigilman 'straight'; nilngman 'finch'; nyilirrman One who ignores or pays no
attention'; wabulman 'light'; yaniman 'that sort'; yi-jumban 'last'; and the forms
dan.nguguwunman, nan.nguguwunman 'from this side, that side', etc.
9.4. -gun ~ -wun, nominal suffixAlso clearly old, and now only moderately productive, is the suffix -gun ~ -wun. Now,
this seems to mainly serve to create semantically adjectival nominals meaning
""pertaining to X"", e.g., laglan 'country, place' and yi-lagla-wun 'indigene, belonging to
place'; wungij 'darkness, night' and yi-wungij-gun 'pertaining to night, nocturnal,
belonging to darkness'; mernden 'ghost, white person' and mernde-wun 'European,
pertaining to ghosts'; ngurruwun 'hot weather' and ngurruwun-gun 'perennial' (of water,
i.e., lasting through the hot season). Less commonly, a suffix perhaps relatable to this
one been found with a small number (3) of verb particles with particle suffix, to create a
derived form which also functions as particle, and which is not distributionally or
semantically clearly distinguishable from the base particle form; see examples following.
                                                                Other aspects of word formation 219
  This suffix is found used with certain common nouns which designate social categories,
to create kinds of gentilic formations. For example, one of the matrifiliatively-
transmitted ngurlu categories (see 1.3.) is goyln 'sugar bag', or 'wild honey'. In the text
Galapin a woman speaks of hjr affiliation with this category, creating with the suffix
under discussion a form meaning ""belonging to/affiliated with honey"", as follows:(522) yi-guyu-wunba                 nganu                goyin                yani-tna
      YI-mother-SOU                  ISO-DAT             honey-ABS            thus-PS
      yi-goyi-wun              yirntg
      YI-honey-NOM             1E:CNSG-ABS
        'From my mother, I an ι honey, like this
         we are honey people'.
   Forms with this suffix may be further case- and adverbially-inflected, viz. in the text
 Galapin the phrase mad-bar ""a mernde-\vun-barra 'in/by means of the European
 mernde-wun) language (madin)', with adverbial suffix -barra (see 5.4.).
   There is some indication of the antiquity of this suffix in the language, in the fact, for
 example, thatthe 'lacking' suffix wagbawun (5.3.2.) is evidently to be analyzed as wagba,
 which by itself means Orphan', or 'trash' (discarded etc.), plus this ending. Also the
 adverb and interjection gayanun 'still, yet, wait' etc. (see 9.5.1.) is composed of gaya
 'today, now' plus this suffix. Finally, a reasonable argument can be made that the
 independent genitive pronoun series contains a suffix which may be historically
 identified with the one under discussion here, viz. the relation between 1SG DAT nganu
 and 1SG GEN nganinggin, 2SG DAT yinggi and 2SG GEN yinggawun, 3SG DAT gunga
 and 3SG GEN gungan.gin, and so on. The fact that many pronouns of the independent
 genitive series have final -gin, that is with a high vowel not to be explained in terms of
 any synchronic assimilatory process, suggests that in some functions the suffix is quite
 old in the language.
   Some nominal forms which are not productive derivations, but with final syllable which
 may be relatable to this suffix, include: yi/maAvu-bujgun 'wild, undomesticated';
 dan.guyugun, nan.guyugun 'this side, that side' etc.; dilygun 'possum'; wu-jarranggun
 'pinky finger'; ma-dulgun 'bladder' (cf. dulgin 'urine'); buruwun 'killer, good hunter';
jurdbawun 'index finger' (cf.Jurd-ba, particle 'to indicate'); miyiwun 'dog'; muruwun
 'bottle tree'; wangguwarlawun 'eastern' (cf. yiyanggu 'east'); andyi-nimgajamayawun
 'last of a litter, runt' (cf. yi-nim^yo 'last-born'). It may even be the case that, historically,
 the negative ngawun contains this suffix.
    The verb particles found siffixed with -gun were: new-ma 'grab', as new-ma-gun;
gurryu-ma 'dive in', asgurryu -ma-gun; and wabirl 'peel, skin,graze' as wabirl-ma-gun.
Note that there is some proble n identifying this suffix with the nominal adjectival one,
 in that following a vowel we would expect the form of the ending to be -wun. It must
therefore be suggested that the ending found with these verb particles cannot be identified
 synchronically with the alternating ending, but it may be an historically specialized form
of it, and may in fact be relatable to that found with lege One' to create the
 morphologically irregular or isolated form lege-gun Once' (see 7.6.5.). Textual examples
of the suffixed verb particles are:
220 Chapter 9

        'My father dived in for [to get] him'.
9.5. -mayin, adjectival suffixAn adjectival ending, -mayin, is attested in the word morrolng-mayin 'green, fresh
(green)'. While this ending is thus rare in Wardaman, it is of some comparative interest,
in that it occurs in other regional languages, e.g., Mangarrayi, as a suffix to cognate colour
terms (and also, in the latter language, with some other descriptive terms). Thus in
Wardaman we find belyeng-man 'red', in Mangarrayi be lye ng-may in; in Wardaman
dewo-man 'white', and in Mangarrayi dewo-mayin, 'white'.
9.6. nya-, actor prefixA few forms meaning ""one characterized by X"" or ""one who does X"" are found to be
derived from verb particles with a prefix nya-. Though fairly uncommon in Wardaman,
this prefix may very likely prove of historical-comparative interest in languages of the
region. The base and derived forms in which this prefix is attested are listed below:
Base            Gloss              Derived                         Glossgiwurrg         'be sulky'        nya-giwurrg             'sulky person, one who sulks'
ginod           'be sulky'        nya-ginod               'sulky person, one who sulks'
ganjayl         'disturb'         nya-ganjayl             'bother, ""humbug""'
yudba           'claim'           nya-yudbarraj           One who claims'
dagurrg         'peer'            nya-dagurrg             'peerer, voyeur'  The particle yudba is used to describe the action of people laying claim to things, saying
that those things are theirs, often with the connotation that they are falsely laying claim
to something which is actually somebody else's. The final syllable of nya-yudbarraj is
unpredictable, and no historical source can be suggested for it.
                                                           Other aspects of word formation 221
9.7. -man, agentive nominal suffixThe suffix -man was found ir two derived forms of agentive meaning: from the verb
particle gerrng-ma 'cry, weep', in yi-gerrngmarnan 'crybaby, one who cries a lot'; and
from the the finite verb ledbarna- 'look at', in yi-ledbarnan One who looks a lot, voyeur'.
  The final segment may be icentified as the absolutive nominal ending (see 3.4.), and
the sequence -rna- may be historically identified with that found in a small number of
finite verbs. This identificat on is quite certain, on the basis that, as noted above,
yi-ledbarnan is directly derived from the finite verb ledbarna- 'look at', and thus only
indirectly linked to the related verb particle led-ba 'look at'. Other verbs with the final
syllable -rna- arejomarna- 'fiiish off', and wojbarna- 'listen' (see 8.1.),
9.8. -widi ~ -bidi, nomin al-forming suffixA rare nominal-forming suflix is attested in two forms: yarrbaly-widi 'nuisance,
nuisance-maker', from the part icle yarrbaly; and jangang-bidl from the panicle jangang.
The meaning of the second requires some explanation.
 There are in Wardaman two particles which people gloss in Kriol as ""hard work la"",
but this has little to do with ""work"" in the Standard English sense. It has to do with the
notion of expending great eff art to try to tell someone something, to make someone
understand or ""listen"". One of these particles is jarnbab (which usually occurs with
yana-\ the other jangang (which also occurs with yana-). Thus it may be said:(526) jangang           ngarr-ge-yi-rri-ya                     wurrugu
       'work'           1INPL-AUX-RR-PST-NAR                   3NSG-DAT
       'We really tried hard with them' [i.e., to tell them something, or convince them
        of something].
  (Note that the AUX ga- is g?- before the reflexive-reciprocal marker.)
  The derived nominal jangang-bidi is used to mean someone who has been the object
of this hard work. Thus speakers gloss jangang-bidi as 'he can't believe', i.e., someone
upon whom one has had no effect, who is incapable of ""listening"" or ""being sorry"" (i.e.,
taking account of one's social effort with him or her).
  Efforts to test this suffix v/ith other particles were met with judgments of non-
acceptability, so it appears to te synchronically rather unproductive.
9.9. -ngana, nominal-forming suffixA rare suffix -ngana has been f aund with particle badbad 'cover' to form badbad-ngana
'blanket', and with reduplicative form durdurrb (from durrb 'stab, jab') to form
dardurrb-ngana 'doctor' (i.e., one who gives injections).
                             Chapter 10
                Issues in constituency and word order
10.1. The question of fn:e word orderAs modern description of Ausfalian languages intensified from the early 1970s, it was
commonly said that they exhibited ""free"" word order, both at the level of the phrase and
the clause (Dixon 1972; Sharpe 1972; see also more recently Simpson 1991, Chapter 2,
where ""free word order"" is desc ibed as a defining dimension of ""non-configurationality""
for the Pama-Nyungan language, Warlpiri). The general claim is that constituent word-
level units can be found in almost any order and the phrase or clause still be grammatically
acceptable. Taken in that baiic sense, Wardaman, too, exhibits greater freedom of
ordering than does English, for example.
  Some researchers, however, have reported of their languages that not all orders are
equally common within the pirase or clause (Heath 1984; Merlan 1988; McGregor
 1990). They have observed tha: ordering is freer than in English and many of the world's
better-known languages, but ha /e sought to open the question, Free with respect to what?
In other words, they have begun to explore the question whether the grammatical notion
of the ""clause"" is the appropriate basis in terms of which to describe ordering phenomena.
In my opinion, the answer wh ch is beginning to emerge from this work is that other
levels of analysis—for example, intersections between constituent structure possibilities
and their typical prosodically organized syntagmatic realizations — must be the units
against which different word-level orderings, and their differing frequency and
meaningfulness, need to be defined.
  We can illustrate from Wardaman examples the difficulties which arise in attempting
to define any particular noun phrase on the basis of constituent structure only, in order
to show how these problems have informed the approach taken further on in this chapter.
Many of the issues involved have been previously noted for their general descriptive
interest. Consider the first few lines of the text (appended) Jalijbang, about a moon
dreaming place on Innesvale Siation.
  A protagonist, of Yiwalyarri iubsection, is identified. Then:(527) yanggi bogogo gangma.i yorri
       'He went hunting and sheared a kangaroo'
        mangali
       'a female'
        wurre-warang
       'with young/a joey'.
 Then the information given to that point is summarized:
224 Chapter 10
(528) yorri nana gangman wiirre-warang
        'He speared the kangaroo with a joey'.
   Obviously, in the text as given, line divisions have already been made which appear to
 be of some significance. These, as will be described, are tone groups. At first,
 information is being conveyed in a manner that may be called ""expansion"": only a small
 ""bit"" is given in each apparent unit. Then a structurally more elaborate summation is
 given, that is, one in which the word-level units can evidently be assumed to comprise a
 whole unit (in this case, clause) in a way the preceding shorter units cannot. That clause
 contains a nominal constituent structure which is not uncommon in Wardaman,
 consisting of a demonstrative determiner, plus nominal plus a nominal modifier of the
 ""having X"" kind described in 5.3. In fact, as we will see, phrases consisting of the first
 two elements — demonstrative plus open-class nominal — are the commonest kind of
two-word noun phrase in Wardaman, and the position of the ""having"" modifier following
the entity is also typical (although such ""having"" constructions may of course occur by
themselves, as the sole word of a noun phrase). The more elaborate phrase shows us a
typical way in which the NP may be realized by a syntagm of words. The preceding
lines, however, cannot be identified as a single NP. One of the main reasons for that must
be taken to be the fact that preceding words do not all occur within a single unit as defined
by prosodic criteria. Semantically, we see that the descriptions ""female"", and ""having
joey"" further specify the reference of ""kangaroo"", for which here the generic term, rather
than any existing, specifically female term, was originally used. A phrase consisting of
an open-class nominal such as ""kangaroo"", and then followed within the same tone unit
by two additional nominal descriptors, would in fact be unusual. It is best to conclude
that in the preceding lines ""kangaroo"", ""female"", and ""having joey"" do not constitute a
phrase, continuous or discontinuous, but together constitute a typical association of
prosodically distinguished units of information.
   To even begin to assemble the evidence concerning what may, and what may not,
constitute a ""phrase"", we have to have some criteria of identification. One must, as is
ordinarily done, take into account the possible function or role of given words within a
conceivable grammatical constituent structure; but identification as a phrase cannot be
made ONLY on such grammatical bases, concerning the possible assignment of words to
constituent structure. If that were the only criterion, we might be tempted for example
to regardgangnian mangali wurre-warang as a discontinuous noun phrase, and perhaps
also to attempt permutations of these words in relation to the verb ""speared"", in order to
establish possibilities of ordering within the clause as a whole. Any or all of such
attempted permutations, I feel quite confident, would be accepted by informants as
intelligible. In doing that, however, we would lose sight of the fact that a group such as
gangnian ntangali wurre-warang is at least not usual within a single prosodically defined
unit.
  It is common for constituent structure to be defined with respect to attested examples
which show the apparent full range of possibilities of realization. What I am suggesting
here, however, may appear to some to go too far: that is, that what may count as an attested
example of a particular kind must be defined with respect to some apparently significant
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 225
criteria that belong to other levels of linguistic organization beyond the simply
grammatical. We have noted the common report that, when what is taken as the central
issue is ""grammaticality"", many Australian languages appear to exhibit such freedom in
ordering that the result has often been stated as ""any order is possible"". But that does not
tell us what orderings are morj frequent than others, or distinguish the meaningfulness
of the different orders. And when frequency becomes an issue alongside grammaticality,
then it must also be asked, in what contexts do particular orders occur? Ways must be
found of discriminating different linguistic contexts, and I am simply suggesting that that
cannot be done with respect :o the same phenomenon one is attempting, in the first
instance, to describe — grammatical function within constituency. Rather it must be
done with respect to actual realizations of syntagms which differ meaningfully.
Obviously, like some other Australianists (Heath 1984; McGregor 1990; all of us
following Halliday and others of the Firthian school), I accept that prosodically defined
units appear to be a significant and much under-studied resource for identifying contexts
with respect to which different realizations of constituent structure may be defined.","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249]"
"
4.2. Nominals: Pronouns, nouns, demonstratives, and
     interrogatives""Nominal"" is the cover term used for a broad class of lexical items which can inflect for
case and certain other categories. Within the class of nominals, several sub-classes will
be identified. The syntactic patterning of all sub-classes tends to be Ergative-Absolutive
where there is an object marked on the verb (even if 3SG zero), but occasional instances
are found in text in which transitive agent nominals are not Ergative-marked.
  Pronouns are those nominals which refer to speech-situation participants, and some
which can index (emphatically, anaphorically) other nominals. There are many formal
similarities between the independent pronominal stems, and the affixal pronominal forms
obligatorily prefixed to the verb to indicate participant identities.
  Demonstrative pronouns are a nominal sub-class which make reference in terms of
graded distance or location categories calibrated primarily in relation to the speech
situation (there are three such degrees marked by Wardaman demonstrative morphology,
and a whole host of formally related terms, ""this side"", ""that side"", etc.). One term in the
three-term spatial system, called Proximate, also serves to indicate textual recoverability.
Its forms are thus far more frequent than are those of the other two demonstrative
categories.
  Interrogative pronouns are nominals with which different kinds of questions are
formed: ""what"", ""where"", ""who"". Secondarily, they function in the construction of
negative and indefinite arguments (""nobody"", ""somebody"").
  Number words belong to the class of nominals. There are three numbers, lege One',
guyamin 'two', and murrgun 'three'. Beyond that ngawurnen indicates 'many, a large
number'. Number words may function as modifiers, or as noun phrase heads in their own
right.
  Finally, there is a large class that will simply be called ""nominals"" in general, but which
comprehends what would be called ""nouns"" and ""adjectives"" in conventional part-of-
58 Chapter 4 speech terms. In dictionary entries and glosses, for the most part a distinction has been
 made between the former (""N"") and the latter (""NADJ"")· This is not because the
 distinction can be satisfactorily sustained for all purposes (see below), but because it
 partly captures some distributional and functional differences within the class.
   Some nominals, the notionally more adjectival ones like ""empty"", ""tough"", ""raw""
 ""crooked"", ""long"", ""good"" and so on, are more likely to function predicatively than are
 what might be called argument nominals such as ""goanna"" (lizard),""woman"", and ""duly
 bag"" (string bag). The more adjectival are regularly causativized and inchoativized,
 while the argument nominals are not regularly so treated. Here, however, the distinction
 is not absolute, for some of them which might be considered towards the attributive end
 of a nominal-feature spectrum, and also some which designate persons in terms of age-
 statuses, for example, are found to be so treated. For example, a noun which typically
occurs as argument, meaning such things as ""plain, flat place"" (as opposed to ""flat"" in
general), may be causativized. A noun such as ""man"" may, also. Finally, the more
adjectival are commonly found in modifying function, while the others are not.
   While a degree of distinctiveness thus can be identified between notionally adjectival
and other nominals, in Wardaman as in many other Australian languages (and regional
ones, including Wardaman's putative congeners, see Cook 1987: 88), the formerare not
limited to predicative and modifying functions, but also regularly function as arguments.
In Wardaman, their functioning as arguments is implemented with the help of the overt
nominal class markers which are prefixed to nominals of the adjectival sort, and create
forms the general kind of reference of which is indicated by the class marker, and the
more specific denotation of which is understood in terms of the ""property-like""
designation of the adjectival stem. Such forms may function syntactically as modifiers,
but equally, they may function as arguments in their own right. The difference between
the two different notional types is fluid enough so that stems of the more adjectival kind,
class-prefixed, may come to be regular designators of (kinds of) referents which have
the particular property. For example, the adjectival stem barnbamin means 'naked,
hairless'; with animate class prefix, the formyi-barnbarnin is used to mean 'buffalo'. To
give a second example, the adjectival stem langman means 'clear, cleared'; with class
prefix, the form wu-langman is taken to mean 'clear space, clear area', and case-inflected
forms of it are commonly used without any (other) argument noun, e.g., wu-langma-warr
'to a clearing, clear place' (allative-marked).
   Another general difference between notionally ""argument"" and adjectival nominals is
that most of the former tend to regularly occur with only one class prefix (if any, for there
are argument nouns like bangbun 'woman' which never take overt class prefix). For
example, most body parts take the class prefix yi-, and tend to occur only with that prefix,
not with any other. On the other hand, most of the notionally adjectival nominals may
be freely prefixed with the range of class markers, something which changes their
understood designation. There are some indeterminacies here too, however (see 5.1. for
more detail), so relatively fixed versus variable class-marking of nominals can only be
taken as a general guide. The point in distinguishing between N and NADJ at all is not
to saddle the language with untenable distinctions, but rather to try to capture some of
the privilege-of-occurrence tendencies which are evident in Wardaman.
                                                                            Word classes 59
43. Finite verbsVerbs obligatorily are marked for either subject alone, or for subject and object. A
maximum of two participant slots can be filled by pronominal prefixes. Other participant
roles are marked on external nominals but nowhere on the verb. Categories of tense,
mood and aspect are marked on the verb in the main by suffixation, but also (primarily
in respect of a mood distinction between realis and irrealis) by prefixes. Weak
subordination and other kinds of clause-level relations are expressed by suffixation to
finite verb forms.
  Wardaman has at least 130 fairly common finite verbs (unlike Wakiman, which appears
to have only around forty, Cook 1987: 90). Among these are eight very high-frequency
CV verbs, a number of which can also occur as inseparable auxiliaries of compound verb
stems, e.g., bu- occurs as a verb in its own right meaning 'hit', but also as auxiliary in
banybu- 'to fill receptacle', dembu- 'to peck', werrenybu- 'to ensorcell', gardbu- 'to
wipe', and so on. Several classes of such ""compound verbs"" can be identified according
to the verb root. There are also many finite verbs which have a simple, i.e., non-
compound, stem, e.g., bewe- 'to tread on', gorno- 'to fill', gene- 'to taste', and others.
Most finite verbs can occur with one or more ""verb particles"" to yield particular
meanings, while some finite verbs occur independently with full lexical meaning e.g.,
waja- means 'to leave', and is often used without particle; but may occur with particles
to create other meanings, such as narru waja- 'to dodge (weapons)'.","[81, 82, 83]"
"
4.4. Verb particles and adverbsWhat are here called verb particles constitute Wardaman's most interesting and perhaps
most complex class. They can be characterized formally partly by the fact that all can
occur with particle suffix (of shapes -ma ~ -ba, see 3.5.3.). Contra some uses of the term
""particle"", in Wardaman this class can be suffixed with Dative, Allative, Dissociative and
Source case endings to form adclausal complements. Particles functioning participially,
and not immediately in construction with finite verb, can be negated by gay. For the
most part, particles occur in construction with finite verbs to express particular lexical
meanings.
  The class of Adverbs cannot, satisfactorily, be entirely distinguished from the preceding
particle class. Adverbs by definition occur in construction with verbs and modify them,
and generally each may occur with a large number of verbs. Particles, on the other hand,
tend to be more restricted in the number of verbs with which each commonly occurs.
That is, there is a greater semantic specificity to many particles which determines the
greater selectivity of their occurrence. In Wardaman, there is no set of formal properties
by which adverbs can be distinguished from members of other word classes. In fact, they
show partial formal overlap with particles in that some can occur with the suffix -ma ~
-ba. For example, the adverb bone meaning 'across' often occurs as borle-ma, and so
may another adverb of similar meaning, malang-ma 'across'. On the other hand, two
adverbs, worroman and lurruja, approximate synonyms which mean 'fast, quickly',
60 Chapter 4never occur with the particle suffix, but instead often occur with the article suffix -bi ~ -wi
(worroman-bi, lurruja-wi). However, adverbs may be distinguished from finite verbs in
that they cannot inflect for person or verbal categories, and from particles in that they do
not function as nominals, and are not case-inflected to function as adclausal
complements. Though the grounds for isolating the class thus seem to be largely negative
ones — as ""not verb, not particle"" — there seems to be utility in having precisely such
a residual class.","[83, 84]"
"7.5.1. 'Who?' yinggiya'Who?' has the Absolutive iormyinggiya, which serves as the non-zero stem. It may be
number-marked for dual and plural with the usual suffixes, and inflected for any case,

10.6. The negated noun phraseOne of the most commonly heard words in Wardaman is ngawun 'nothing, none'. One
man of my acquaintance was in fact called by the nickname ""Ngawun"", because
whenever anybody asked him for anything they could be sure of his answer. However,
ngawun is an interjection. The particle which most commonly negates the noun or noun
phrase is wonggo, or secondarily warna. These always precede that which they negate
(see 12.2.5.).(590) wonggo             lege              miwinin

"5.2.6. AblativeAblative case signals that the nominal to which it is suffixed is the point of departure for
some motion or transit, as in (78) and (79):(78)   wumbang          yi-bu-n                       wiya-wa

  The Ablative has two somewhat specialized uses. One is to indicate the route followed,
a pergressive notion, as in (80):(80)   ngarr-ga-n                 wu-ma-wa       yondorr-wa     wonggo

case-ending -gunya ~ -wunya. With human and animate nominals, it generally expresses
an anti-benefactive notion: person or entity ""away from whom"" the predicate's meaning
is to be understood. It may also be understood to express ""on account"" of a human or
animate, though this meaning is secondary with such nominals. However, with inanimate
nominals, the case-ending usually is understood to express the meaning ""on account of
the entity to which it is suffixed.(82)   dordo-werreng          ngarr-ya         gunya                    yingangun-bu

       away for us/on our behalf.
  The Dissociative form in (82) is a complement of the verb of going. It differs from
Ablative in that it does not merely express the notion of ""point of departure"", but
additionally the idea of going to get away from the referent of the Dissociative-marked
nominal; hence the ""anti-benefactive"" sense of the case-form.(83)   mowoj             0-yanggi             nganunya

       'He took the old man's wife away from him'.
  There is an interesting, somewhat different usage of Dissociative. The 3SG independent
pronominal form gunya is sometimes found to be used to mark, not the ""person away
from whom"" the predicate action (trajectory, position etc.) is to be understood, but rather
an ""anti-benefactive"" consequence of what is predicated by the verb for a major clausal
participant. In other words, here the Dissociative actually functions somewhat more
directly like an additional element of the predicate, implying that there will be a negative
consequence for a participant of engaging in the verbal activity.

 In (86), gunya relates to the 2SG participant expressing the notion that eating the thing
mentioned has negative implications, will not be of benefit, but ""anti-benefactive"".(87)   narrng-ma         nunu-we                      gunya
       stuck-PS          2NSGIRR-AUX                 3SG DISS
        'You might get stuck'.
  Here, Dissociative underscores that what is predicated as possible (getting stuck) will
be non-beneficial for 2NSG. The same kind of relation between predicate and participant
is found in (88):(88)   0-jarram-bu-rri   birdij             0-gi-ndi            gunya           jimimdi

       0-jarlgba-rri-wan
       3SG-stab-PST-DF
        'He looked around, found the knife [to his detriment] and stabbed him'.
  It is difficult to fluently translate the anti-benefactive contribution of gunya above. It
is understood to mean that the finding of the knife was of detriment to the one who is
understood victim, and direct object of the verb ""to stab"". (88), however, differs from
(86) and (87) in that, presumably, any independent Dissociative form could be substituted
there, and the meaning understood in relation to that person-number category. That is,
in (88), the Dissociative is not a third person category interpreted directly as an element
of predicate meaning, as in (86) and (87).
  With inanimate and non-human nominals, Dissociative case marks the thing ""on
account of which"":(89)   wonggo           wurr-yo-rri            ngawun-gunya             layin-gunya

       ""They didn't spear him for nothing, [but] on account of meat'.
  A final example shows that, where in context a human or animate nominal is clearly
understood as one ""on whose account"" or more generally ""in relation to whom"" the
predicate action is understood, the case-suffix is interpreted accordingly.

with each other over one's theft of the other's wife, Garnayanda.
  One common way of asking ""what for"" in the explicit sense On account of what' is
ngamanda-wunya [what-DISS], and this may be further suffixed with the indefinite,
emphatic interrogative -warda (7.5.8.): ngamanda-wunya-wanda 'whatever in the world
for?'
  It is clear that when Dissociative can be understood in relation to a major clausal
participant (one marked by subject or object pronominals in the verb), it is interpreted in
the sense ""away from"" with reference to that participant (with verbs of motion and
trajectory), or in anti-benefactive sense. Where it is not interpretable as conveying
meaning in relation to such a major clausal participant, it is interpreted in the sense ""on
account of. Thus the latter may be the interpretation given to instances with both
inanimate and animate nominal; but for this to occur with the latter, the animate nominal
must be clearly interpretable (from clause and text structures) as other than a major
clausal participant.
  It is important to make explicit that Dative, not Dissociative, is generally used as the
complement of verbs of taking (me-) and stealing (e.g., ditransitive mowo-). In the latter,
the person stolen from is marked by object pronominal on the verb (ngon-mowo-rri 'he
stole it from me'), and any use of independent 1SG Dissociative pronoun in construction
with the ditransitive verb generally receives a speaker judgment equivalent to
""ungrammatical"". But also, a meaning such as 'he took it from him' tends to be expressed
0-me-ndi gunga, with 3SG independent Dative pronominal. Thus Dative is typically
used to express something that may practically be understood as anti-benefactive, but it
is not generally expressed as Dissociative. In example (85), use of Dissociative gives a
fairly concrete spatial formulation to the verb and complement, something like ""took
away, physically carried away from him"". Dative is clearly the more general case, and
may express a relation to a complement of both semantically benefactive and
anti-benefactive kinds. See example (119) below.","[102, 103, 104, 105]"
"
1.3. Linguistic typeWardaman is both prefixing and suffixing. It has relatively complex nominal and verbal
morphology. There are three overt nominal class markers (yi-, ma- and WM-), at least the
first two of which are used to designate fairly unified sets of denotata. Most noun stems
occur only with prefix of one particular class (e.g., yi-biyan 'man, person, Aborigine');
but some may occur with more than one, producing lexical difference (yi-mum 'eye',
wu-mum 'nipple'). As well, there are many nouns which occur without prefix (i.e., with
0- prefix), but with which modifiers (adjectival nouns) may exhibit overt concord.
  Number and case are marked by suffixes, and the syntactic case system tends to be
fairly strongly Ergative-Absolutive. However, there is wide use of a clause type with
actor subject (not generally Ergatively-marked if represented by an independent
nominal), and objective complement marked by Dative case. As well, there are various
one-place (fully intransitive) clause types. Overt suffix categories include
Ergative/Instrumental, Dative/ Genitive, local cases Allative, Locative and Ablative, and
the semantically most restricted local category, Originative. In addition, there are two
morphologically composite case categories, historically built on the Dative. The first,
an historical composite of Dative plus Locative, is termed Dissociative, and usually
expresses the meaning ""from"" or ""away from"" of an animate participant, or ""on account
of of a wider range of participant types. The second, historical composite of Dative and
Ablative, expresses a range of notions including source and cause, and is labelled Source.
  Participants are obligatorily marked by pronominal prefixes in the verb, and
secondarily by independent pronouns. A maximum of two participants are indicated in
the verb by transitive prefix forms that tend to be portmanteaux, i.e., not neatly
segmentable into parts representing each person/number that enters into the combination.
  In the expression of verbal meanings, there is a basic distinction between inflecting
verbs and what I have called free verb ""particles"". It is common in linguistic descriptions
for the word ""particle"" to be used to designate non-inflecting parts of speech. In
Wardaman what I call ""particles"" can take some inflections. The term ""particle"" in this
sense, however, has had currency in Australianist studies for some time (see Dixon ed.
1976), and I retain it, but place emphasis on describing the possibilities of inflection, and
the important syntactic functions of these elements. ""Verb particles"" are semantically
full, and occur in combination with a small number of high-frequency inflecting roots
(including a number of significant ones of shape CV). Where such particle and verb
combinations are highly regular in a specific verbal meaning, the construction is
generally labelled that of Particle plus Auxiliary in this description. However, it is
                                                                               Introduction 5
significant that here, seemingly more than in some other regional languages which have
this general construction type (e.g., Mangarrayi), the ""AUX"" often transparently has
some clear semantic commonality with the particle, and thus cannot be regarded simply
as a formal mechanism or bearer of inflections. For example, with the particle gayardung
'run', most common are the motion verbs ya- 'go' and nyanga- 'come'. These of course
partly function as grammatical ""auxiliaries"", in that they bear person and verbal
categorial inflections; but transparently, they are semantically integral with the particle.
The clear kind of semantic integration in this case contrasts with that, say, between the
particle wululu and its usual ""AUX"" we-, which may occur by itself in the meaning 'fall,
be born'. However, together, the combination wululu we- means 'enter, go inside' (not
""fall in"" or the like). That is, there is no clear semantic ""transparency"" of the AUX in
the latter case, and thus a greater idiomaticity to the combination than to those with
gayardung. Thus, the label Particle plus AUX is applied to combinations which may
differ considerably in their internal semantic relations. The diverse nature of
combinations within this construction type is clearly of comparative interest, and this
labelling should not by any means disguise the fact that, as noted above, ""AUX"" is a
semantically and functionally flexible, diverse and problematic category.
  Particles have a wide syntactic range. They may be inflected for nominal categories
(case), and occur in non-predicative construction types as nominals, and as modifiers.
Paradigms of inflecting verbs tend to be highly regular: there is a very limited amount
of suffixal allomorphy for tense/aspect/mood categories. The one thoroughly irregular
paradigm is that of the verb ""to go"".
  Suffixal categories of the verb include Present, Past, Future, and Potential, that is,
express tense and in some instances, tense/mood meanings. An Admonitive (""lest"")
construction is generally built on a zero-stem form, or is built on the Future stem in the
few verbs where this is a formally distinct (and obviously historically moribund)
category. Further tense/aspect meanings (e.g., iterative) are expressed by additional
suffixation to verb forms inflected for tense/aspect, and in some instances (Habitual) by
special prefix forms.
  A basic mood distinction between Realis and Irrealis categories is expressed by verbal
prefixation, in combination (in some instances) with differences in the bound pronominal
forms which express person/number as between the two mood categories.
  Weak subordination of one predication to another is a common means of constructing
discourse linkage in Wardaman. There are two sets of subordinators, one expressing
non-past, the other past, temporal reference. Another important mechanism of textual
cohesion is ""de-focusing"" of overtly occurring NPs, i.e., marking of them as recoverable
and thus cohesive with surrounding linguistic context.
  Three deictic ""degrees"" are distinguished in the demonstrative system, with some
irregularity in the paradigms. The spatially intermediate category (not ""this""and not
""yonder"", but proximate ""that"") also serves to indicate textual recoverability, and is thus
most closely comparable to the English definite article.
  There are five main points of articulation of parallel stop-nasal series: labial, apico-
alveolar, apico-domal or retroflex, lamino-palatal, and velar. There are laterals at three
of these points of articulation, apico-alveolar, apico-domal, and lamino-palatal. The
6 Chapter 1 lamino-palatal lateral has a very limited distribution. There are retroflex glide and tap
 alveolar rhotics. While there are five vowels /, e, u, o and a, the mid-vowels do not
 occur in any of the inflectional morphology, except as the result of low-level assimilatory
processes. The mid-vowels do, however, occur in a small number of important
derivational morphemes, and they occur freely in the wider lexicon.
   There are no vowel clusters in Wardaman, and no vowel-initial morphemes besides the
 tag-question particle ale 'isn't that so?'.
   There appears to be little intra-language variation, but minor differences in a few lexical
items were noted among speakers.
   Like Warlmanpa to the south (see Nash 1990), Wardaman speak of different territorial
sub-groupings, to which recruitment is normatively in the male line, as having different
madin 'languages', or 'words'. Each such identifiable grouping is said to have
minimally one, sometimes more, special words that are ""their"" language. Typically, these
are said to be either the sound made by, or the language spoken by, principal mythological
figures saliently associated with given Wardaman sub-territories. For example, an
important mythological association with the sub-country just west of Willeroo Station
homestead running westerly to Garnawala (Mount Hogarth) is gulirrida 'peewees',
which are abundantly represented in some of the spectacular rock paintings in this area.
The ""language"" or ""word"" of the peewees, and therefore of the grouping of people
patrifiliated to this area, is said to be mamundajgani, a form for which no etymology can
be given. A few of the ""words"" for particular sub-groupings may have etymologies in
other languages of the Victoria River area. At least one is clearly onomatopoetic (e.g.,
standardization of a bird cry). Knowledge of this kind of relation among people, territory
and salient ""word"" or ""words"" is limited to older people. The madin 'words' about which
there appeared to be wide agreement were: mamundajgani, cited above; ngagandoroj,
the ""word'Of menngen 'white cockatoo', a major dreaming around the Innesvale Station
homestead area; yidabu and wamanga, words associated with warrija 'crocodile'
dreaming, localized at Mt. Gregory; and nenene, a ""word' (imitative of a bird cry) of
bulyan 'eagle', associated with Jalad, or Price's Creek, area. The words associated with
""crocodile"" are interesting, and either have etymologies in other Victoria River
languages, or apparently in any case connote the meanings ""beef, meat"" and ""hit, strike""
(Wardaman deb 'hit, belt' was used to gloss wamanga), both principal elements of the
myth associated with Mt. Gregory, the principal characters of which, Warrura and
Barnangga, fought over a catch of crocodile. In addition, a dilygun 'possum' dreaming
associated with the high country along Mathison Creek is characterized by a particular
style of speaking, with stopped nasal segments similar to the speech of a person trying
to talk with a blocked nose. Thus, possum says dadadi instead of danani 'this one'.
Asked about these ""languages"" or ""words"", people will emphasize that they are all ""one"",
the ""same Wardaman"", that is, are socio-territorial distinctions made by people who share
a common language in the linguist's usual sense.
   Among other systems of social relationship, Wardaman people recognize several
(equatable) sets of subsection (or ""eight-class"") terms, but identify only one of these as
""proper"" Wardaman. That set is given in 5.13. They also recognize matrifiliatively
transmitted recruitment to groupings commonly called ngurlu across the Victoria River
                                                                                   Introduction 7
region. These groupings are not localized. Among my Wardaman informants, most
belonged to one or other of the ngurlu: goyin 'sugarbag', ganben 'flying fox', warrag
'catfish', yiburu 'black rain', and yiwaganga 'rain'. While some of these are specifically
Wardaman words (e.g., goyin), certain of the names (e.g., yiburu) have wider currency
across the region, and cannot be considered only Wardaman.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"

10.2. Information units, given/new and theme/rheme contrastsHalliday (1985 and earlier) suggests that two major dimensions of textual organization
in English have to do with ""information"" and ""thematisation"" (see also McGregor 1990
for application of Hallidayan concepts to the Western Australian language Gooniyandi).
Information is concerned wit ι the given/new opposition, and thematisation with the
theme/rheme, or topic/comm:nt, opposition. He further suggests that information
structure is primarily expressed prosodically, while the thematic structure is realised
through constituent order. In the previous section I suggested the importance of
considering constituency and prosody in relation to each other, in order to achieve a
descriptive scheme which delimits phrase structure and ordering possibilities within the
phrase in a meaningful way. For present purposes, I consider the use of prosodically
defined units to be one of the most helpful methodological offerings of the Halliday
framework, mainly because it provides an opening into the study of the interaction
between grammaticality and other levels of the organization of text.
  Halliday (1985: 274) observes that an information unit does not correspond exactly to
any unit in the clause grammar, but other things being equal, tends to be coextensive with
one clause, as the ""default"" ccndition in English. Each information unit is realized as a
pitch contour, or TONE, which extends over the whole tone group. Within the tone group,
one foot or syllable carries thi main pitch movement, and the element which has this
feature of tonic prominence is said to carry the information focus. The tonic foot marks
where the 'new' element of information ends. Halliday (1985:277) considers information
that is presented by the speaker as recoverable as ""given"", and that which is presented
as not recoverable to be ""new"".
  The Wardaman texts appended to this grammar were realized as sequences of tone units.
Each such unit is identified by number. Many are short and occupy only one line. The
main criterion for identifying ;i tone unit is on the basis that it is bounded by significant
pitch movement, either a rise or a fall. Typically, such a unit is also bounded by short
226 Chapter 10 pause, but the presence of pause is not in itself defining of a tone group. In some cases
 it is ambiguous whether a particular stretch of speech is best identified as two tone units
 or as one. This is especially the case where it appears that there may be some pitch
 movement at the possible tone unit boundary, but pitch remains relatively constant
 (compared to other instances). In other words, questions of identification may arise
 because intonational phenomena are perceived as a matter of degree. The temptation to
 identify a separate tone unit may be strengthened where there is also pause at such a
 possible boundary, but as noted above, pause in itself is not definitional of the tone unit.
    As McGregor (1990: 362) notes for Gooniyandi, tone units in Wardaman do not
 necessarily correspond to grammatical units, although they do so in particular cases. As
has often been noted for Australian languages (and as in the Moon Dreaming text, above),
a single nominal word may frequently be found on a tone unit of its own, set apart from
 other constituents to which it is meaningfully linked. Because nominal and other words
are frequently set off in this way on their own tone unit, a number of such units together
may contain the information that might otherwise be contained within a clause. At the
same time, it may often happen, as Halliday has shown for English, that a tone group will
be equivalent to a clause, as for the Moon Dreaming group ""he speared the kangaroo
with joey"". In the case of smaller constituent units which may comprise part of a clause,
I make the assumption that while whatever set of nominal words occurs on a single tone
unit may comprise (one or more) noun phrases, it is not legitimate to assume that nominal
constituents occurring in different tone groups constitute part of the same particular
phrase (although the same actual forms may occur elsewhere as part of a phrase on a
single tone group). Thus, in the above Moon Dreaming example, mangali 'female' and
wurre-warang cannot be regarded as part of the same noun phrase, even though these
two words might occur together elsewhere within a tone unit and as part of a noun phrase.
That is, I am prepared to use occurrence on a single tone unit as a minimum condition,
necessary but not sufficient, for the identification as a noun phrase of any given set of
nominal words.
   Following Grimes (1975) and others, it is possible to suggest that there is a distinction
to be made between more central or primary tone units, and secondary ones (see
McGregor 1990: 364). In such a scheme, the primary unit may be defined by greater
prominence of its salient syllable, and by greater pitch movement over the contour. A
secondary unit, whatever its precise character, may be defined as in association with a
primary one, and generally characterized negatively, by lesser syllable salience and lesser
pitch movement. McGregor (1991: 365) suggests for Gooniyandi that the primary unit
normally contains the propositional nexus: the verbal complex in clauses with verbs.
Further, secondary units normally consist of a single clausal constituent: NP, adverbial,
or other. McGregor goes on to hypothesize the existence of a tonic sentence, defined as
a primary unit in association with one or more optional secondary ones. In information
terms, the secondary unit(s) tend(s) to elaborate the primary one, or otherwise convey
information closely related to that of the primary unit. I have not put this plausible
distinction between primary and secondary units to work in this description, that is, units
in the texts are not identified as primary or secondary. I would only note that the
distinction might be profitably elaborated as a set of typical primary-secondary tone unit
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 227
nexus types; for example, there is a prosodic relation of dependency between the
(typically short and unelaboraied) tone units containing a ""say"" verb, and the unit(s)
which realize the reported speech which the verb projects.
  There follows consideration of the constituency of the noun phrase, and in 10.8. a
summary of noun phrase structire types. This is given together with discussion of normal
ordering within the phrase. While no doubt further meaningful distinctions made by
ordering remain to be discerned, it is suggested that regular meaningful differences in
the presentation of information appear to be associated in some instances with the
difference between the orders: demonstrative determiner followed by nominal, versus
nominal followed by demonstrative determiner (DEM + N versus N + DEM). I will
propose that this difference may be seen as part of the organization of difference between
unmarked and marked Theme types, that is, less or more remarkable organization of what
any particular tone unit or sequence of them is ""about"". A further introductory word may
be useful here about the notion of theme.
  Again following Halliday (1935:278-279) in his elaboration of Firthian and Pragueian
notions, thematic structure may be defined as that dimension in which is organized what
a stretch of speech is about. Theme is commonly defined as (1) the point of departure
of what the speaker has to say, or more fully, (2) what the speaker is talking about, the
topic; while Rheme is commonly defined as the completion of this point of departure, or
the comment. Obviously, the £ iven/new contrast may interact closely with the theme/
rheme one, in that, for example, it is possible for something to be presented as either an
expected or unexpected, a givei or not given, point of departure.
  Finally, we will need to consider how to approach the question of the presence and
ordering of nominal constituents of clause-level syntactic function, intransitive Subject,
transitive Object, and ergative-marked Agent. It is common enough for such functions
to be marked only on the verb within any given tone unit, that is, for there to be no overt
nominal expression of any given major clause function. Some discussion of lexical
realization of these functions is thus required, because case-marking of them is obviously
dependent upon their occurrence. But beyond that, is it possible to say that an occurring
nominal typically precedes or :bllows the verb of which it is the object? To the extent
that the agent of a transitive verb is realized by a nominal expression, where does this
occur with respect to the verb1; We will see that the ergative-marked agent is the least
frequently occurring of the three syntactic types, and that there is a tendency for all three
to occur preceding the verbal word or words; but that this tendency is apparently strongest
for nouns and noun phrases in intransitive subject function, noticeable but not extreme
for ergative-marked transitive igents, and least noticeable for transitive objects, which
occur both pre- and post-verba ly with more nearly equal frequency.","[249, 250, 251]"
"  Possibly, given its usual position before the finite verb, the post-verbal position, and
particularly the tone-group final position gives a special prominence to the predicate
meaning expressed by the particle.
  In general, insofar as a determinate semantic relation can be posited between particles
and finite verbs, the former may be said to restrict the latter in that they contribute a
specificity of meaning that the latter does not have by itself. Particles do not regularly
combine with each other to constitute predicate meanings in the way, for example, two
or several verbal roots regularly serialize in some New Guinean languages; examples
with more than two particles within the same finite clause have not been found, and those
of two are not regular, idiomatic combinations. Where two particles occur together, there
seems to be a regular semantic relationship between them of the following two kinds.
First, one of the particles might be described as semantically more specific than the other.
It is one that enters into regular combination with the finite verb in a unique lexical
predicate meaning. The other particle is more general than the first, semantically
compatible with it, and refines or elaborates it semantically. This second particle tends
to be of such generality that, along a notional spectrum of predicate modification such
as was mentioned in Chapter 4, it might fall into the category of adverb.
  In the second sort of case, there again exists a relation of semantic compatibility,
perhaps even partial synonymy, between the two particles, which need not be contiguous
within the clause, and together they reinforce a particular predicate meaning, or express
a conjunction of partly similar, paired meanings. The relation of specificity and
generality typical of the first sort of case is not found here; instead, the two particles
appear to be of approximately equal lexical specificity. Examples of these sorts of
combinations follow.(614) nan-guya            nganburr-ga-ndi-ya-marla                         buda-wu

         the two of them took me foraging and camping out for black plum'.
254 Chapter 10
   This example might be seen to illustrate both types of particle cooccurrence
characterized above. First, in the second line there is the combination girdibun-ma which
means 'finish, end' (and as a nominal modifier may mean ""all, the whole lot"") together
with the particle plus verb combination yarr-ma ya- 'to diminish, tail off, end', often used
of seasonal rains. The former particle is more general than the first in that it expresses
completion more broadly, and restricts the following lexical combination, producing a
meaning something like ""when it ended completely, altogether"". In the last line is the
combination bogogo ngurlmud, of the second sort, where one particle cannot be seen as
restricting or modifying the other, because they are of approximately equal lexical
specificity, semantically compatible in that each designates activities defined in
opposition to staying put, being in camp and the like. The result is a more conjunctive
kind of expression: ""foraging and camping out"".(615) lurle      wu-lu-rri-ya     ngawurnen                   mulerr-ma

        Ά great number [of them] cried and grieved/cried in mourning'.
  (615) may be considered an instance of the second kind, where there is a relation of
semantic compatibility and partial synonymy between the two particles, lurle used in the
meaning 'cry, weep' and mulerr-ma with connotations of public, loud, grieving and
mourning, particularly for a death. Together the particles encode and reinforce a single
predicate meaning (as opposed to a more clearly conjunctive one of the bogogo ngurlmud
type).(616) nganinggin   yibiwi                   0-lu-rri-ya           nganu    na_

        'My father cried for me now he worried and longed for me'.
  In (616), moyin-ma (which, like some other constructions of sentiment and affect,
occurs with the Absolutive nominal mejern 'stomach', see 10.4.), apparently conveys a
sense of worry or concern, while luyurr-ma designates longing, pining, or sometimes
compassion for. The combination seems to be conjunctive, rather than one particle
restricting the other.(617)   warlarrgu       wud-janga-ndi                werrwerr
        outside         3NSG-come-PST                outwards rdp
        'They came outside'.
  As first briefly mentioned in 7.6.3., in Wardaman as in Wakiman (see Cook 1987:253),
there is a common use of two orientational particles which locate action or state as
""outwards"", ""outside"" and ""inwards, inside"" (but the relational sense, or the relation to
something else, of both terms may sometimes not be very precisely defined or explicitly
indicated). In Wardaman, the most common term that designates 'inside, inwards' is
                                                         Issues in constituency and word order 255
warljub(-a), and this is more adverbial than specifically particle-like, in that it readily
occurs with any number of finite verbs, and is not particularly strongly associated with
any, in anything approximating a regular particle plus finite verb combination. There is,
however, a second particle wululu 'inwards, inside', which while it may combine with
any verb of motion (""come"", ""go"" etc.), tends to occur with special frequency with we-,
which by itself means 'fall'. The combination wululu we-, however, does not mean to
""fall in(side)"", but rather simply 'go inside, motion inwards' wululu ngerr-we-n 'let us
go inside'.
  The particle werr-ma Outwards, outside' is often used to describe the situation of
people emerging from the countryside into a camp or habited place, approximately 'they
came out'; it is used to describe where rivers and creeks come ""out"" or debouche; and to
describe the emergence of dreaming figures from the landscape or from a position covert
within landforms into the visible world, or into a particular place. As in (610), this particle
may occur with other forms such as warlarrgu, generally used (now, at least) to talk about
Outside' a house or other structure as opposed to inside, and of such generality that it
might be designated an adverb as easily as a particle. Although werr is also of
considerable generality (i.e., it is used to describe the ""outward"" motion or position of a
large range of arguments), it is more particle- than adverb-like in that it is regularly found
in lexical-syntactic combination with the finite verb bu- to express action or motion
outwards (although it MAY also occur with other verbs). Thus, the coocurrence of
warlarrgu and werr would seemingly be best described semantically as one of a more
general item modifying a more specific one, and together expressing not just emergence
Outwards' (i.e., the inward to outward trajectory of werr), but to the outside (the general
location designated by warlarrgu).
  The examples presented so far have been of particles cooccurring within a single clause
on a tone unit, where each particle (or adverb) is associated with the finite verb of the
clause, each in the same way, or one apparently modifying or restricting the other. It
often happens in connected narrative that particles are used without a finite verb but
simply with a major argument of a (partly realized) clause, often the object, as in the
following:(618)   wurr-bel-wu-rri-ya             girdibun
        3NSG-slice-PST-NAR             finish        wolon            barlbarlb           wurr-gi-ndi-ya-wuya                      gunga

        'They sliced it, that's all (finished)
        the two of them spread the grass out for it
        heap up stones, spread out grass'.
  Especially given the preceding context, the last tone unit can be easily understood
despite the absence of any finite verb. There are many textual examples elsewhere of a
256 Chapter 10tone group consisting of one or two grammatically complete clauses, and then an
""appended"" particle without finite verb, final or near-final within the tone group. The
effect of this kind of ""incomplete"" structure is to indicate that the action, condition etc.
designated by the particle should be interpreted in relation to the rest of the tone group,
and in direct relation to major arguments within it. Insofar as ""ellipsis"" is used to mean
that some constituent formerly present has been zeroed, the term does not seem
appropriate. We seem to be dealing with instances in which the particle SUGGESTS the
fuller verbal expression. The following set of examples should illustrate this common
textual effect:(619) wurr-ga-ndi-ya         nana       magulu          rm                dun    wiya-ya

      'They took the yam now and tipped it into water'.
  A usual combination with particle dun 'tip, pour' is the finite verb wudba-. In (619),
however, there is no finite verb with dun, but the object of the particle is clearly understood
to be the immediately preceding magulu, and the subject, the 3NSG pronominal on the verb.(620)    wurr-me-ndi            jubung

  Here a few lines are given to establish that there has been one instance of ""they ground
it"", with particle jubung and finite verb me-; the object, 'charcoal', is separately specified
and then repeated in the third line, which ends with particle ngay 'mix, stir', and no finite
verb. The following line begins with the finite verb (me- is the usual finite verb with
ngay, while jubung commonly occurs with both bu- and me-), a repetition of ""with
water"", and of the particle itself.(621)   marlarluga                 nurdurd

        '[they put] the old men in a heap
        they heaped them up
        they just shot them and heaped them
        they shot little tiny kids and all'.
  The particle without finite verb occurs in the third line: duyma 'heap' normally occurs
with the finite verb gi-. The following line does not return to more fully specify that
predicate, however, but returns to the theme of shooting and the fact that even little
children were killed.(622)   gud     0-gaju-rri          worroman-bi         wardabarrb

        'He got up quickly with a start
        ran and descended to the river'.
  The first line might be interpreted as a combination of particles of compatible
semantics, gud more general in that it designates arising, getting up, and wardabarrb
more specific in that while it implies arising, it also specifies the manner in which it is
done as sudden, or unexpected. Both gud and wardabarrb normally occur (in
intransitive clauses) with finite verb gaju-. That is, it is probably not appropriate to see
wardabarrb as the particle of a truncated or ellipsed clause, but as the second member
of a particle combination with gud. In the second line, however, we may posit that
yirrgulun judjud are members of an incompletely specified predication ""and descended
to the river"". Indications that this string never achieves clausal status are: first, that
yirrgulun is Absolutive, instead of Allative as one might expect in a fully developed
clause; and secondly, \hatjudjud normally occurs with we- in the meaning 'descend',
and therefore may be interpreted as occurring here without finite verb. The latter point
is somewhat equivocal, for judjud also regularly occurs with the verbs of motion 'go'
and 'come'; however, given the lack of case-marking on 'river', we may interpret this as
a textually-cohesive fragment, rather than as a particle-combination with finite verb να-.
  A passage similar in context occurs further on in the same text from which (622) was
drawn:(623)    gayardung      0-yanggi              gunya            yirrgulu-warr         barrwa

        black soil-LOC
258 Chapter 10
        'He ran away from him and down to the river
        along the river and came up and out on black soil'.
  Here the particlejudjud is once again apparently not directly paired with a finite verb
(though the ""river"", the place to which the subject descended, is regularly case-marked).
The meaning is perfectly clear because of the surrounding specification of the nature and
direction of action.(624)   galul wurr-(y)anggi           worroman-bi        gayardung        julu-ya

        duba
        sit-PS
        'They ran up quickly and sat down on the hill'.
   The particle duba is here without finite verb, normally.//«!»/-, but again its absence does
not impair intelligibility.
   Although such unpaired particles commonly occur tone-group finally, as so far
illustrated, they may also occur in other positions, especially group-initially:(625)   wardarl          0-yana-rri           ngawun
        struggle         3SG-AUX-PST          nothing        new        wardang         0-wudba-rri
        grab       belly-up        3SG-AUX-PST
        'She struggled, nothing [to no avail]
        he grabbed and threw her belly-up'.
  The particle new 'grab' is unpaired; it usually occurs with me-, and does not occur by
itself in combination with \vudba- (which as independent verb means 'throw', and
obviously retains some ofthat semantic content in its combination with wardang). 'Grab'
in such a construction as this obviously has the same nominal arguments as wardang.
  While further above were illustrated kinds of particle combinations which may be seen
as members of a single finite clause, in the immediate preceding examples we have what
should be regarded as particle adjuncts of less than full clausal status to a single clause.
These adjuncts add to the development of text, and are related to the fully specified clause
in a way that presupposes the sharing of major arguments and argument functions by the
particles, and the applicability of other verbal categories (tense-aspect) to the additional
particle as well as to the clause as a whole. These constructions cannot, however, taken
to be serialized ones insofar as ""serialization"" is understood to mean the regular
combination of predicates in determinate lexical meanings. The constructions illustrated
here are textual ones, i.e. not essentially analyzable at the clause level, though they
certainly interact with and are constrained by clause-level structure. The particle
adjunction effects a close textual linkage between the major clausal predicate(s) and the
adjoined one. This packaging of narrative material is most closely comparable to the
inclusion, within a single tone-group, of more than one finite clause. While comparable,
these processes must be distinguished.

 Inclusion of two full clauses within a single tone group is common, although it is
unusual in the narratives collected for a tone group to contain MORE than TWO clauses.
Examples of two clauses within a single tone unit follow.(626) belgin             wurr-ngu-ndi         wurr-wemi-yi-rri

  These examples show that, in the textual linking of two full clauses by prosodic means
only, although it often happens that the two finite verbs share an object, or (perhaps better
put) presuppose the same object, they may in fact have different subjects and/or objects.
(629) illustrates different subjects of the two prosodically-Iinked predicates, the linkage
highlighting precisely their opposite direction of movement: as one went down the other
went up. The prosodic linkage of full clauses on a tone unit, then, is an even more
explicitly ""textual"" (rather than ""grammatical"") device than is particle adjunction; for
the latter operates in terms of the sharing of core arguments among all predicate
constituents and the controlling of verbal categories by the finite verb.

      Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements
11.1. Introduction: Special properties of particlesMany languages in this region, like Wardaman, have predicate structures of more than
one kind, some of which consist of more than one word. Verbal construction types were
described in 8.1., and the distinction was made between predicate structures consisting
only of finite verb, and those consisting of verbal ""particle"" (following some long-
standing Australianist usage, see Dixon ed. 1976) and finite verb. We saw that among
the finite verbs which may occur as predicators by themselves, with full lexical meaning,
are high-frequency verbs (including most of the CV- roots) which also occur widely with
verb particles, to constitute most of the language's verbal lexicon. It was shown that
there is moderate flexibility in alternative pairings of the same particle with different
verbs, and that this kind of alternation, besides making differences in lexical meaning,
also instantiates differences in clause-level transitivity in what was accordingly termed
a ""lexico-syntactic"" manner. This kind of transitivity system is consistent with the fact
that there tends to be a strong coincidence between particular verb and either transitive
or intransitive clause type (e.g., bu-, gi- etc. transitive, jingi- intransitive). However, a
simple dichotomy between transitive and intransitive clauses and/or predicates was
argued to be inappropriate, mainly because of the considerable degree to which verbs
which, as clausal predicates by themselves determine transitive clause structure, with
particles may instantiate the Absolutive-Dative clause type.
  Although particle plus verb constructions occur in many other languages of the area,
their range of functions is rather distinctive of the group of presumed congeners including
Wardaman (for Wakiman, see Cook 1987 Chapter 9; the same range of functions is
indicated by the more limited material available for Yangman). Particles in these
languages have at least two major functions: first, they productively occur with finite
verbs to express predicate meanings; and second, case-marked in a number of ways that
will be described in this chapter, they form clausal complements. It is in this second
range of functions that the particle system of Wardaman and congeners is particularly
distinctive, as compared with other regional languages. For example in the languages
immediately to the east (of the Wardaman-Yangman dialect continuum), Mangarrayi and
Alawa, particle plus verb constitutes the usual kind of predicate construction. But the
extent to which particles in those languages may be used in adclausal complement
constructions is very limited, and in particular, there is no parallel to the Allative-marked
complements described in 11.4.3. and 11.7. Though the particle plus verb construction
type of all of these languages is superficially similar, the differences in syntactic
distribution of the particles support the view that we are not dealing with similar syntactic
systems. There appear, also, to be some, much more minor differences between
Wardaman and Wakiman in the way that particles function: in Wardaman they do not
262 Chapter 11
occur alone, without finite verb, as imperative utterances (Cook 1987: 253). This
difference may be related to some others, e.g., the fact that the 'particle suffix' in
Wardaman (11.1.2.) cannot be clearly associated with aspectual categorial meaning in
the way it apparently can in Wakiman (Cook 1987: 235).","[277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286]"
"122.2. Bujun 'if, lest'The clausal particle bujun enters into two types of constructions. First, it may mark the
protasis of a conditional clause, either non-past or past. The protasis of the non-past
conditional clause is commonly constructed either with future or present irrealis tense
form; and if the latter, it is commonly subordinate. Past conditionals are constructed with
past irrealis predicate. Normally, bujun occurs in first position in conditional clauses,
and later in the clause in its second function.
  The second function of bujun is to express 'lest' or 'it might be the case that', where
the anticipated outcome is usually unwelcome or negative in some way. In this meaning,
the clause expressing unwelcome outcome may occur relatively independently; that is,
unlike the conditional construction in which two clauses are closely linked both
structurally and semantically, this construction type is realized by a single clause (which
is, of course, cohesive with others, but not necessarily in a close structural relation to any
other as in the conditional one). In this second function, bujun usually follows the
predicate rather than being in first clausal position, but this is not invariably so: it may
(rarely) occur in first position. Examples of both construction types follow.

have a store of poison, and one tells the other he cannot give him any, lest he become too

 Examples of the second function are:

        Take off your clothes, they're wet, put on dry ones, lest you get sick'.
  (722) and (723) are examples with predicate that have distinctive future stems (8.2.).
These examples, compared with those in 8.9.1., show that the admonitive meaning may
be understood as such with or without bujun. Though as noted bujun usually occurs
following the predicate in such constructions, it may occur in first clausal position:(724)   bujun     nunu-jologbi                 lagla-ya           warlgin-(n)ya
        lest      IRR2NSG-urinate-FUT          camp-LOC           bed-LOC
        'You might pee in your bed!'
  In (724), the admonitive (future stem form) of the verb is sufficient to indicate that this
is not a conditional construction.
  The 'lest, it might be the (unwelcome) case that' usage of bujun is conveyed in Kriol
by Wardaman speakers by the construction ""by-and-by"" plus subject plus predicate, e.g.,
""by and by you fall down"". Like the Wardaman construction, this is not a simple statement
of certain event, but a warning regarding possible consequence.","[317, 318, 319]"
"11.1.4. Nominal derivation from particlesWhile in certain ways particles in Wardaman have noun-like properties (viz. their
negation discussed in 11.1.3. above), a derivational process may be applied to many to
create adjectival nominal forms meaning ""possessed of the property designated by the
particle"".
  Such nominalization involves the suffixation of -n to the vowel-final particle (in the
instances attested, to the form with particle suffix), and the prefixation of a nominal class
specifier.
  There is considerable evidence of -n as nominal suffix in Wardaman and congeners,
not least in the final-syllable system which undergoes reduction before non-zero suffixes
(see 3.1.). There it was shown that occurring finals are not limited to -n, but many also
have vocalic augment (-in, depending on the shape of the root. In any case, final -n is
ubiquitous.
  Besides this evidence of the historical significance of-n in the formation of the nominal
lexicon, there is also evidence of its synchronic derivational status. This plays a part in
the derivation of semantically adjectival nominal stems from particles, and also from
verbs with inseparable final suffix -ma ~ -ba. Before turning to examples of this, it is
important to note that there is also widespread evidence of the long-term historical status
268 Chapter 11
in the language of a nominal suffix with (phonologically) conditioned forms -ban and
 -man. This may be described in general as a semantically adjectival nominal suffix. In
some cases it can transparently be seen to designate an entity in terms of ""having the
characteristic property"" or ""performing the characteristic action, noise"" etc., signalled
by a preceding root. This is most transparent in certain onomatopoetic bird and other
names with this suffix: welej-ban 'parrot', jeg-ban 'turkey'; nilng-man 'fmch(es)',
nirriwu-man 'cicada', etc. But the suffix is found in many other nominal stems which
designate properties, characteristics or conditions, where little further insight is possible
into any derivative meaning, e.g., goyog-ban Orphan, person without relatives';
berlerl-man 'kerosene tree'; ngunag-ban 'good smell'; mele-man 'black', to cite just a
few examples. Insofar as any broad semantic specification of this nominal suffix is
possible, it may be identified as generally adjectival and largely found as an element of
stems which designate inherent properties and characteristics (though, as noted above,
many of these stems are argument nouns in their typical syntactic distributions). In its
designating inherent characteristics the suffix contrasts with a nominal derivational suffix
-gujban ~ -wujban, which productively derives many, predominantly agentive, adjectival
stems from verb particles and from finite verb stems; e.g., a derivate of the particle jilig-
(ba) 'wake, awaken' is jiligjilig-(g)ujban 'awakening fellow, one who goes around
waking [people] up'. (See further 9.3., 11.3.1.)
  In summary, the nominal suffix -ban —man is old, may be etymologically related to
the particle suffix -ba ~ -ma, and obviously has had a large role in shaping the current
inventory of nominal forms. Some of these, like the onomatopoetic animal names, are
associable with an adjectival derivational semantic, but there are many nominals with
this suffix that function as typical argument nouns, and afford no additional insight into
the suffixal semantics. This nominal suffix can be linked to the particle suffix if it is
assumed that there is a final nominal suffix -n, which is pervasive in the system of nominal
final syllables more generally (3.1.).
  Examples of the derivational relation of adjectival nominals to verb particles and finite
-ba ~ -ma verbs follow. Any particle stem ending in b is followed by particle suffix of
the form -ba, but such geminate clusters are generally reduced (3.3.), and therefore only
one stop will be written, e.g., /barlbarlb-ba/ will be written barlbarlb-a. Since the
majority of derivations are from panicles, only the finite verb base forms will be
specifically identified as such; all other forms in the left-hand column are particles.

semantically completely transparent (e.g., particleyo/ay-ma '(be, feel become etc.) weak'
and jajayman 'weak one, person'). Other forms are not as obviously predictable: the
particle bilyb designates the action of swishing leaves as part of traditional curing, and
the derivative bilybilyban 'devil dog' is alleged to have certain medicinal and sorcery-
related powers. Similarly, gerrej-ba 'fly away' has derivative gerrej-ban, which usually
occurs as modifier in the nominal phrase mernden gerrej-ban (mernden = 'ghost, spirit',
also 'white person'); this being is characterized by taking flight, often leaving its
footprints as signs of its passage on the ground. The particle nyilirr-ma is especially used
of someone who ignores or does not listen to others; nyilirrman is someone who acts
superior to others, refusing to heed them (Kriol ""flash""). The particle gelegele-(ma) is
used to describe spearing or firing right past a target without hitting it, as in:(650) gelegele-wi       0-yo-rri             go                    gonjo-biji
      gopast-ART        3SG-spear-PST        3SG-DAT              ground-only
        'He speared right past it [hitting] the ground only'.
  The adjectival nominal gelegeleman designates something which has been frightened
or startled, (as if) by something such as a weapon, although the element of being the
target of a weapon need not be explicit:(651)   werr-ma        0-bu-ny-ga              gangman                        mambang

        3NSG-AUX-PST-NAR          frightened-ART
        'When the kangaroo emerged they chased the frightened thing'.
270 Chapter 11  As described in 7.6.3., yani-ma is one of a class of adverbal indices ""thus, like this, at
this (sort of) time"", and so on. By the derivational process it is made into a nominal index
""a thing like this, this sort of thing"":(652)   \vu-donyman-gurne         yi-marn-bu-rri         nana

        YI-this sort-ART          WU-crooked-ABS
        'You've made it crooked, it is crooked like this [one/sort]'.
  While the process deriving nominals from particles and verbs by means of -n is highly
productive and widely attested, there is much more limited evidence of the derivation of
semantically adjectival forms from nominals with final syllable -n by nominal class
prefixation to a form in which the nominal ending has been zeroed. From the nominal
yirrgulun 'river' is derived an adjectival form ""riverine"" by that process:(653)   layin            gangman           nu-yo              ngarrugu           wonggo

        YI-river        game-ABS
        'You [NSG] shoot us a plains kangaroo, not a riverine one'.
  Note also the phrase ma-gonjo, also ma-gonjo mayin, meaning 'ground-living
vegetable', from the nominal gonjon 'ground'. This process is not widely attested, partly
because many nominals, with appropriate nominal inflection, can function directly as
either modifiers or arguments, e.g., wu-mondoban may be used to mean either 'dark
shade' or 'very shady place' (see Chapter 4). Otherwise, there are derivational suffixes
which are more widely attested in the formation of semantically adjectival nominals (see
e.g., 9.4.).","[291, 292, 293, 294]"

2.3. Distributional restrictions: ConsonantsWord-initially there is no distinctive contrast bet wee n consonants of the two apical series.
Where no vowel immediately precedes, in ordinary speech the word-initial realization
of initial apicals tends to be alveolar rather than retroflex. However, when a vowel (of
another word, or of a vowel-final inflectional prefix) immediately precedes, the stem-
initial norm tends to be quite strongly retroflex (but in terms of auditory impression, not
quite so much so as in some languages of the region, for example, Ngalakan). For
example:
       ['na.rri]         'he saw it'
       [yi'rna.rri ]     'you [SG] saw it'
      ['climana]        'horse'
      [y/ 'rdirdiman ] proper name, YI- class marker  Though there is no reason to recognize a word-initial contrast between the two stop-
nasal series, the question remains how to represent the morpheme-initial norm, as plain
alveolar, or as retroflex, or perhaps some other way which shows that there is no clear
auditory contrast except post-vocalically, and following non-nasal sonorants.
  This situation, or something similar, presents itself in a number of the local languages
that have two apical series (see e.g., Merlan 1983: 9-10); that is, there is no, or in some
languages scarcely any, direct contrast between morpheme-initial alveolar and retroflex
apicals. Though the situation might be descriptively treated in a number of ways, my
preference is to regard morphemes as retroflex initial. Phonetically, the retroflex series
is relatively marked, the plain alveolar unmarked. In light of this, it is theoretically more
satisfactory to explain the lack of phonetic contrast word-initially by a neutralization in
favour of realization by the less marked series, than to treat the situation as one in which
retroflexion adds a feature to some kind of archiphonemic segment in the post-vocalic
environment (following a vowel-final prefix).
  However, a practical cost is associated with the decision to treat morphemes as retroflex
initial. Usage in most of this description, as is otherwise common, is to represent retroflex
segments in practical orthography by a digraph consisting of r plus a letter designating
the rest of the segment (e.g., rd for the apical stop, etc.). It is daunting to write the r
morpheme initially, a procedure which results in forms like rdagbarla 'keep it', and
rnarri 'he/she saw it'. Therefore in practical transcription, lexeme-initial apicals will
be represented without initial r. This practice is extended to phonetic environments in
which retroflexion is quite pronounced, as after vowel-final prefixes (e.g., nga-nam Ί
saw it'). This makes it necessary for anyone reading this transcription to keep in mind
that, following vowel-final prefixes and elsewhere post-vocalically, the pronunciation of
initial apical consonants of lexical stems is with a significant degree of retroflexion.
                                                                          Segmental phonology 17
  The contrast between apical series is amply illustrated elsewhere, morpheme- and
word-medially and finally. In word-final position note the contrasts between members
of each series:
   /gulid/      'green plum'          vs.          /mardird/           'whistling kite'
   /menjen/      'dangerous'          vs.          /mejern/            'belly'
                                      vs.          /yingelembern/      'collarbone'   /jurrul/     'saltwater turtle'    vs.          /nyurl/             'be/get angry'   There are additionally numerous examples of minimal and sub-minimal contrasts
medially between the two series: e.g., wu-walu 'ring finger' vs. wu- warli 'arm, creek,
tributary'; yirrgitlun 'river' vs.yigurliyn 'first rain'; ngone 'hooked spear' vs. wurne
 'bone'; yi-welen 'jealousperson' vs.yi-werlen 'lazy person'; bidij 'twist' vs.birdij'find'
 (particles); gelelen 'cold' vs. gerle- 'to taste'; gitda 'where' vs. bigurda, a kind of plat
potato; gadi 'lily' vs. gardirrg 'gnash teeth' (particle), and so on.
   The above generalization does not apply to the rhotics, since /IT/ has not been found
initially in lexical stems, and only two instances of /r/ have been noted to date: the bird
term rewrew 'dollar bird', and a toponym (referring to a creek near Willeroo Station
homestead in the Wardaman heartland, and seemingly not a foreign form), Relwuyugun.
Besides the fact that the bird term is onomatopoetic, it should also be noted that very
similar terms for this bird occur in neighbouring languages. It is likely that there are
complex diffusional relations among them. However, in Jawoyn the form of the word is
dewdew, and beyond the surmise that the diffusional source is not from Jawoyn, it is not
clear why Wardaman should have a form with an initial segment that does not otherwise
occur in that position in the language.
   /rr/ does occur initially in inflectional morphemes which can never be word-initial, e.g.,
in the past tense allomorph -rri. /r/ is (so far) not attested in stem-final position, indicating
at the least that it is c[uite uncommon there, if indeed it may occur at all. The apical /rr/
however is common finally, e.g., /bamarr/ Owenia vernicosa, 'marble tree', /geremerr/
'headband', and so on.
   Medially, the contrast between the two rhotics distinguishes a considerable number of
forms, and there is no reason to regard the contrast as marginal (cf. Cook 1987: 29 on
Wakiman). Exemplifying by comparing the sequences -ara- and-arra-, we may list the
contrasting forms, among others: war ay 'ask', baraj 'far', garab 'spider', wuniara
'heavy stone', janiaram1 lid, doof,garnaniara 'walking stick' Jabara 'putrid, stinking',
barangan 'rift,gap',darab 'bog', and-garang ~ -warang 'having'; vs. barlarra 'hide',
barragarl 'spear', buwarraja 'dreaming', lawarra 'riflefish', warrala 'lie, be spread-
legged5, warrania ' sugar glider', -barra ~ -warra adverbial suffix, among others.
   Some consideration needs to be given to the statement of the distributions of the two
palatal sonorants ly and ny. We will consider the lamino-palatal lateral first, since its
distribution, however analyzed, is especially restricted Then we will return to questions
of the statement of distribution that apply to both lateral and nasal palatal segments.
   The lamino-palatal lateral (unlike the nasal) never occurs in stem- or word-initial
position, and its occurrence medially (excluding, for the moment, intervocalically) and
18 Chapter 2finally is quite restricted, both lexically and positionally. The following includes all
instances of medial (save intervocalic) and final ly found in a list of approximately 2000
(mostly lexical) roots (excluding names of all sorts, personal, toponymic and other):
      bedelybedeyl                'hit all over, flog'
      bilyb(a)                    'switch, swish long object over' (esp. in curing)
      bilybanbilyban              'devil dog' (etym. related to above)
      dilygba                     'wait'
      ally gun                    'possum'
      dilyma                      'light, burn'
      ganyjayl                    'annoy, bother, disturb'
     gilywaj                      'trample'
     jalybug                      'pound, crush up, mince'
     jilyma                       'wring out, squeeze (juices) out of
     milygbilygba                 'beat, thump, ""heart-crack"" [Kr.], be shocked'
     wily ma                      'stretch'
      wilyma                      'whistle' (different AUX from above)
     yarrbayl                     'bother, annoy'  This list demonstrates that about half the instances of the lamino-palatal lateral are final
in verb particles (which often have the additional morph -ma, see 11.1.2.)· Otherwise,
the lateral occurs only before peripheral segments (mainly stops b and g, but note one
instance before w). Overall, the lateral shows a nearly-complete lexical restriction to verb
particles (with the exception ofdilygun 'possum', and the derivate bilybanbilyban).
  There are comparable distributional restrictions on the lamino-palatal lateral in
Yangman, as far as the more limited data indicate. Also, there is in Mangarrayi a small
handful of />'-final verb particles (four have been found). And though all of these appear
to also occur in Yangman, and evidently represent an historical diffusion from that
language, inquiry indicates they are now regarded by speakers as Mangarrayi words, and
not as recognizable borrowings. The restricted distribution of this lateral can, on the basis
of the evidence, be seen as an areal phenomenon in which Mangarrayi participates
marginally.
  In Wardaman, there seems to be little plausibility to the suggestion that these instances
may be viewed (historically) as combinations of / plus a high vowel IM phonetically
realized as palatalization. There are enough cases of stem-final // (e.g., mangali 'girl,
female') to make it clear that such palatalization is not, in any event, a synchronic process.
And there are attestations of word-final lyi, as in /malyi/, toponym. In contrast with the
lateral, the palatal nasal is much more common stem-finally, and is distributed over
different parts of speech (e.g., juyn 'to set' (of sun, particle), jirrangaliyn 'mud
swallow'). It, too, contrasts directly with final nyi (as in mobonyi 'night time').
  There is, however, some question about analysis of both palatal sonorants
intervocalically, simply because in that position there is no clear or convincing basis for
a contrast between ly versus a combination /+ y, or between ny versus n+ y, as there
                                                                          Segmental phonology 19
is finally. This is true, for example, of a word for a catfish species, which could
alternatively be /ginyang/ or /ginyang/, or the word for 'echidna' which might
alternatively be represented phonemically as /gawalyan or /gawalyan/.
  The question of a two-segment versus single-segment analysis may simply be said to
be irrelevant in those medial environments. There is no phonetic difference that can be
established between the two possibilities. We can show this by observing inter-
morphemic combinations of n + y and / + y, where the y is the initial segment of an
inflectional suffix (e.g., YI-buruwun-yi 'killer', ERG). In the text transcriptions in
practical orthography, morphemic combination is always distinguished from intra-
morphemic ny and ly by a hyphen at morpheme boundary.
  In summary concerning word- and morpheme-final position, we note that all stops and
nasals, all the laterals, the glides /y/ and /w/, and apical /IT/ are attested, while /r/ is not.
A few examples attest to final contrast between each glide, and the combination of glide
and homorganic vowel, for example:
      dawu      'that way'         vs.          daw                   'sound sleep',
                                           also maw                   'take off'
      waray     'ask'              vs.          gunduyi-ma            'give hiding, belt'  The set of final nasal contrasts is illustrated by:
      yi-mum            'eye'
      gunbilin          '(native) doctor'
      mejern            'stomach'
      garnbayn          'type of cabbage palm'
      gayardung         'run'  The contrast among laterals finally is exemplified by:
     jil-ma             'company, keep company' (particle)
     jily-ma            'wring, squeeze' (particle)
     mirlirl-ma         'rise' (of sun)  The final contrast among stops is illustrated by:
     bardab             'look around'
     dulwad             'count, enumerate'
     mardird            'kite'
     garnbij             'clapstick'
     gandawag           'moon'2.4. Phonotactics: Consonant clustersThere are no morpheme-initial consonant clusters except for the very rare combination
gl, so far attested in only two forms: -gle 'putrid, rotten', and medially in the (obligatorily
reduplicative) particle lowaglowa 'play', gle- has never been found to occur
20 Chapter 2
word-initially, but rather is always preceded by one of the noun class prefixes (yi-gle,
wu-gle). There is also a place name wugleni 'Johnstone Hole', which might be related
etymologically to the root -gle. There is at least one instance, in a bird name, of a
particularly minimal and indistinct, if indeed organic, vocalic segment between b snarl.
This occurs in the word \jnjiirijbllrlan]' friar bird'. However, there are no other instances
suggesting the possibility of a cluster bl.
  Within morphemes, combinations of apical nasal plus apical stop contrast as between
the two apical series: nd vs. rnd. As in neighbouring languages, there are no such
combinations in which the nasal and stop differ in place. The same is true for the (rare)
combinations of lateral plus apical stop (e.g., Id, which only occur at reduplicative
boundaries). The transcriptional practice adopted for the retroflex combinations is to
write the indicator of retroflexion only once, thus: rnd, rid.","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"
"12.2.3. Gala 'try'The particle gala has been found in construction with verbs in the following tense-
aspect-mood forms: present, admonitive (marked by zero-stem form or distinctive future
stem, depending on the verb), and imperative. With predicates in present tense, only first
person forms, or pronominal adjuncts which include a first person, have been found to
occur. That is, with present tense which expresses relative certainty or imminence of
unfulfilled action, apparently only first persons (or first-plus-others) can have the
appropriate intentional status as actors. In construction with gala, although formal
admonitive and imperative forms have both been found to occur, the former are
uncommon, and semantically not clearly distinct from the imperative, among other
reasons because such forms have only been found with second person subjects. The only
difference may be between admonitive and imperative that the former make the
imperative force of the utterance slightly less, or more tentative. See discussion
following the examples concerning why gala may occur with ""admonitive"" future-tense
forms, and not with the ordinary future (8.6.). First, examples of gala with first person
(plus) pronominal adjuncts, and present tense forms are:

  If gala were equivalent to English ""try"", it should be possible to use it in the past tense.
The fact that this is not possible shows that gala is not equivalent to English ""try"", and
that its core meaning is one of uncertainty concerning an as-yet unrealised state of affairs.
Combined with the present tense, gala expresses intention of the first person (plus) subject.
  Combined with first- or second-person subject future-admonitive forms, it expresses
either the subject's inner sense of necessity to do what the predicate designates (first
persons), or the attribution (to second persons) of an intentional force. Notice then how
such future-admonitive forms appear to differ from the ordinary future, e.g., nganjigbe
Ί will go, I must go', in which no sense of indeterminacy or uncertainty is attributable
to the subject, but rather only unmitigated volition, intention, or necessity to the subject-
predicate combination as a whole. The ordinary future, in other words (see 8.6.) is a form
of the verb which expresses all such meanings but without clearly distinguishing if, or
the extent to which, they are to be attributed to the subject, or exactly where necessity
and intentionality are to be located. The distinctive future-stem or admonitive
construction differs from the ordinary future precisely in modality, in that it expresses
uncertainty (and most generally, undesirability) of an as-yet unrealised state of affairs. It
is thus possible for it (rather than the ordinary future) to co-occur with gala. With
imperative forms, gala expresses the clearer attribution of uncertainty to the agency of
the second person subject, i.e., ""you try to do X"" (but you may not succeed).
  Seeing ""uncertainty"" as the core semantic dimension of gala, with different
modulations of intentionality varying with tense-aspect-mood form of the verb, helps to
understand the interjectional formation possible with this particle, gala-warda, best
translated as either Ί don't know', or more generally'who knows?','it's not clear', where
the uncertainty is understood in relation to the speaker as a pragmatic effect of the usage
of the expression. Here, gala is paired with the indefinite suffix -warda (7.5.8.), and is
thus a regular member of the set of forms which may be so suffixed, expressing general
uncertainty. Examples of usage of this form are shown in the following conversation-like
sequences (invented by informants without suggestion as to content, to illustrate the
meaning of gala-warda):(734) A:       guda-ni         0-yanggi        jangari      yilama-gan 0-yanggi

"8.17. TransitivityThere is a clear difference between canonical transitive and intransitive clause structures
in Wardaman, the former characterized by the presence of two pronominal adjuncts in
the verb, and by the subject pronominal corresponding to an independent Ergative-
marked, semantically agentive nominal; the latter, by the presence of one pronominal
adjunct.
                                                                 Categories of the finite verb 203  However, a bipartite transitive-intransitive division of both clauses and verbs is
unsatisfactory. Let us consider clause types first, and here it becomes apparent that it is
useful to recognize at least three major ones, and at least one minor one.
  An intransitive clause may be defined as one with one pronominal verb prefix (Table
16, Type 1). Various kinds of complements may occur in the intransitive clause, none of
which is marked in the verb, e.g., a clause with predicate of motion may have a
Dissociative nominal complement, 0-yanggi gunya ' he went away from him', a location
complement of some kind, and so on.
  The canonical transitive clause is one in which there are two pronominal adjuncts, one
of which may be linked to an independent Ergative-marked nominal (that is, if this is
present), while the other represents the direct object category (Type 3). There is a
ditransitive clause type, which only a few predicates may realize, in which the two
pronominal adjuncts represent the semantic agent and the semantic indirect object (Type
4).
Table 16. Types of Noun-Verb Relations                   Noun                                  Verb
1                  ABSi                                  SUBJj
2                  ABSi+ DATj                            SUBJi
3                  ABSj+ ERGj                            SUBJj+ OBJj
4                  ABSj+ ERGj+ DATk                      SUBj + OBJk   This leaves the question of how one may regard the common Absolutive-Dative clause
Type 2 in Wardaman, i.e., that in which there is one pronominal adjunct to the verb, a
semantic agent, and a Dative (often, semantically benefactive) clausal argument function
which cannot be encoded on the verb, but may be expressed by independent nominal
phrase, commonly a pronominal. If one takes the presence of verbal pronominal prefixes
as definitional, this clause type is to be regarded as intransitive. But if one defines the
clause type in terms of predicate semantics and argument roles, such a clause-type would
better be regarded as two-place, rather than one-place (intransitive) with possible
additional complements. The agent nominal, if present in such clauses, is over-
whelmingly Absolutive, although it may occasionally be Ergative-marked
  One might also recognize as a distinct sub-type the clause with one pronominal adjunct
which is a semantic agent or experiencer, in which there may be an Instrumental phrase
expressing the semantic cause or source. The archetypal predicate which occurs in this
clause type in Wardaman is ba- 'bum, perish', often with Instrumental niarninggam-yi
'sun'. As with other intransitives, there is an optional purposive (formally Dative)
argument position ""for which"" that may occur with this predicate, e.g., nga-ba-n wiya-wu
'I'm thirsty for water'. But the really distinctive things about this clause type are, first,
the presence of the semantically agentive nominal phrase which cannot be marked on
the verb, but instead is realized as Instrument; and the encoding of the sole semantically
patientive nominal by subject form-class in the verb.
  It seems out of keeping with the structural diversity of clause types, then, to simply
recognize a distinction between transitive and intransitive clauses. We may more
204 Chapter 8usefully recognize (at least) the types shown in Table 16. Some further minor types may
also be identified on both semantic and formal grounds; e.g., that described in the
preceding paragraph; the mediopassive construction; and as will be seen below, a
construction type might be recognized for which a label ""medioactive"" might be coined,
to handle the case of a some predicate (particle plus verb) phrases which mainly designate
weather conditions.
  If it is not useful to recognize a simple bipartite division of clauses, it is also not
completely satisfactory to recognize a bipartite division of verbs, for at least two reasons.
The first is that the transitivity value of finite verbs as sole predicate constituent, and as
member of a particle plus verb construction, may be and often is different. There is a
large number of particle plus verb combinations, in which the finite verbs are the same
ones that generally occur elsewhere as predicates of transitive clauses. With some
particles, however, they do not determine transitive clause structure. For example, the
finite verb gi-, by itself, is transitive, or the predicate basis of transitive clauses. With
the particle mllid 'show', however, it takes only one pronominal adjunct, and any indirect
object, ""person shown to"", is a Dative-marked nominal which cannot be encoded in the
verb; thus its argument structure is of the Absolutive-Dative kind. In combination with
other particles, such as denberr 'hang up, suspend', gi- is the basis of transitive clause
structure.
  In the same way the verb root bu- may occur in transitive and other clause types
depending upon its occurrence as sole predicate, versus its particular lexical combination
with given particles. Although bu- as sole verbal constituent is transitive, in the particle
plus verb combinationyMrd^a) bu- 'to show to' it occurs in the Absolutive-Dative clause
type, and any ""person shown to"" must be Dative-marked outside the verb.
  The root bu- is particularly common in particle plus verb combinations which designate
weather conditions, and clauses of this kind show no evidence of being structurally
transitive. For example, in clauses with the particle plus verb combinations jurrg(ba)
bu- 'sprinkle, rain lightly', and larrawardba bu- 'to break' (of day), there is no syntactic
indication of transitivity:(482)   galulul ya-0-wudba            marlnga          jurrg-ba     ya-0-bu-n-ga
        toprdp 3-3SG-throw           cloud-ABS         sprinkle     3-3SG-AUX-PRES-SUB
        'Way high up clouds form when it sprinkles'.
  There has never been found to be an explicitly agentive nominal which may occur with
this combination, although the ""cognate"" nominal wiyan 'rain', in Absolutive form, may
co-occur.(483)   larraward-ba        ya-0-bu-n                  maminggani
        break-PS            3-3SG-AUX-PRES             sun-ABS
        'The day is breaking'.
  The Absolutive form of ""sun"" in propositions with this combination may be taken as
an indication that it is formally intransitive (i.e., one-place). It might, as suggested above,
be useful to recognize this as a distinct predicate class, for bu- otherwise typically occurs
                                                                   Categories of the finite verb 205
in transitive or Absolutive-Dative clause types. Combinations of bu- with other particles,
such as bag 'break', yield transitive clause structures.
  Likewise, the verb na- 'see' is ordinarily transitive (ngawun-da-n Ί see them'), but
occurs in a formally intransitive clause structure with the particle lag(ba), meaning as a
whole 'to dry up, become dessicated'; in this combination, it is partly synonymous with
the combination lag(ba) ngegba- 'to die and dry up', where ngegba- normally, as sole
predicative constituent, occurs in intransitive clause structure.
  The second kind of evidence that militates against a strict transitive-intransitive
distinction at the level of the predicate is the fact that one important predicate, yana- 'say,
do' is found used both transitively and intransitively. Clauses with this predicate tend to
be structured transitively first, where there is a jussive complement of ""commanding
that"" (see 477 above), or second, of ""saying to that"" with complement clause not one of
directly reported speech, in which case the person told may be treated as direct object:(484)   ngan-yana-rri              ya-0-nyangi-we                yiwarna         wiyan
        3SG/lSG-say-PST            3-3SG-come-FUT                next            rain
        'She told me she will come next year'.
  Note that this amounts to the possibility of ""indirect"" report, i.e., the report is not framed
as direct speech, but rather as a summary of what was said, or as indirect speech.
Transitive usage of the verb also is common where what is said is a nominal ""cognate
object"" of speech of some kind, and not necessarily a complement clause:(485) nganburr-yana-rri-ya                    madin
      3NSG/lSG-say-PST-NAR                    word-ABS
        'They gave me knowledge', in the sense 'they imparted information'.
 Intransitive usage tends to correspond to the function ""tell to"", ""say to"" or ""relate to"",
where the complement is a clause of reported (direct) speech:(486) dana-ni-wan         0-yana-rri          nganu
      this-ART-DF         3SG-say-PST         1SG-DAT
        ""This is the one"", she said to me'.
  The same possibility of variable transitivity exists with the particle plus verb
combination yang(ma) bu- 'tell, inform'. Ί informed them' may be either yang
nga-bu-ndi wurrugu or yang ngawun-bu-ndi, and either may have a full linked clause
(either independent or subordinate in form) specifying the content of the report. Textual
examples were recorded in which the particle jurd-(ba) 'show, indicate', which normally
occurs with finite verb bu- in Absolutive-Dative clause-type such that any ""person shown
to"" must be put into Dative case, alternatively occurs with constructionally transitive
yana-, as indicated by the fact that the one to whom something is shown is marked by
object pronominal form in the verb. (For a parallel difference in transitivity of the ""say""
verb in Wakiman, see Cook 1987: 221.)
206 Chapter 8   Given the evidence presented here of the inadequacy of a bipartite transitive-
intransitive distinction at either clause- or predicate-level, we nevertheless capture
something significant about the language by noting that there tends to be congruence
between particular verbs as sole predicative constituent and particular clause types, i.e.,
bu- as sole predicate normally occurs in transitive clauses. Further, predicates which as
sole constituent function transitively also, in combination with particles, commonly
occur in Absolutive-Dative clause structures; but predicates which function intransitively
as sole verbal constituent also tend to function intransitively in combination with
particles.
  There is no single process of transitive-intransitive derivation (but see 8.19. on
causatives). Rather the difference between transitive and intransitive predicate meanings
and associated clause structures is generally managed ""lexico-syntactically"", by the
alternation of different finite (auxiliary) verbs with the same particle. Hence, the
difference implemented by such alternation is often not simply a grammatical one relating
to transitivity, but may also involve additional elements of lexical semantics. Below are
listed a number of common alternations of the same particle with different finite verbs,
the difference instantiating the difference between transitive and intransitive clause

  This list shows that a common transitive-intransitive pairing is gi-ljingi-, but other
pairings are found As independent predicate gi- means 'put', and jingi- 'sit', but the
latter also has an important copula function (""be, be in a place""), as well as auxiliary
function with particles.
  The sense of some of the pairs listed may be more or less transparent. In some cases
the pair corresponds to a difference in transitivity in clause type, but seemingly without
great semantic difference, e.g., mamaj ngen-me-n 'he beckons me', versus mamaj
ya-0-yana nganu 'he beckons to me', or the like.
  The difference in pairings with wabirl is that between ""peel"" or ""take the skin off,
versus ""come, peel off, fade, fall off, as one might say of paint on the wall or colour in
clothing.
  There are many alternative possible pairings where there is no change in transitivity of
the clause, but rather a semantic difference in the nature of the action predicated. In
Wardaman, this kind of alternation cannot be seen as of formally different kind to the
transitive-intransitive pairings shown above. Some of these alternative pairings give
some insight into verbal lexical semantics. Examples are:

yulun-            me-               wo-                'give in ex change, get'  In some cases we must see the semantics of particle plus verb pairing as rather
compositional, e.g., lag ngegba- 'to die and dry up'; or luglug-ba ba- 'to swell up and
burn'; mun-ma ba- 'to cook in a ground oven, pit'.
208 Chapter 8  From some alternative pairings with me-, it becomes clear that this verb has a central
semantic component in many combinations of ""action by hand"", e.g., dibdib me- 'to
extract, remove' versus dibdib buju- 'to extract, dig out'; birrij bu- 'knead' versus me-
'stir', where the latter is an action more fully implemented with the hand only. It also is
clear that the verbja/α- which by itself is used to mean 'to boomerang', in combinations
expresses a component of meaning ""touch tangentially"", e.g., din.gawurrg bu- 'to hit on
the neck', versus din.gawurrg jala- 'to hit a (glancing) blow on the neck'.","[226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"
"7.6.7. Secondary adverbsA few common adverbs are worthy of mention as ""secondary"", that is derived from
basically adverbial forms by means of nominal case-suffixes. The processes involved
are not regular, but examples include: gurru-ya 'later', built from the adverbgiirru of
the same meaning by addition of the Locative case suffix; niarla-warr Over and over,
again', built from what is elsewhere (8.13.) an iterative verbal suffix by means of the
Allative case-suffix; andyijarlu-warr 'sometimes', built from the adjectival nominal
stemyijarlu 'some', again with the Allative suffix.

8.1. Introduction: Verbal construction typesThere are two common types of verbal construction in Wardaman. One has as its main
constituent a finite verb which by itself expresses the lexical verbal content of the clause.
It carries pronominal adjuncts in keeping with the transitivity structure of the clause
which the verb partly instantiates, and marking for a number of verbal categories
including tense-mood-aspect, and possibly others such as subordination. Finite verbs
may be divided into a number of different formal types, based on shape and analyzability
(see following).
  The second kind of construction is one which consists of a verb particle and inflecting
verb. The verb particle, an interesting, multi-functional part of speech, is the basis of
formation of a number of types of adclausal complements (see 11.4.). But for the moment
we will consider it only as part of the verbal construction. In such particle+ finite verb
structures, often most of the lexical verbal content of the clause is associated with the
particle, while the lexical contribution of the finite verb may vary. We might think of the
possible internal relation of particle and finite verb as a spectrum, with variation along
it in terms of the semantic specificity versus generality of the verb. Where the verb is
highly general, it may seemingly contribute only to specification of the transitivity of the
clause, but very little to lexical meaning. Where the verb is semantically more specific
and transparent in combination with the particle, it contributes both to the specification
of transitivity in the clause, and to lexical meaning in a more readily analyzable way.
  Most particles tend to be fairly specialized in their co-occurrence, that is, they occur
with only one or a small number of inflecting verbs. But combinations tend to differ in
the extent to which the meaning contributions of particle and verb can be assessed. An
example is birdij, which in material recorded has been found with only two inflecting
verbs. Its combination with the CV- root gi-, yields the meaning 'find, locate'. In
construction with the CV- root na-, it means 'to espy, to find' (as, in the terms of
Australian Aboriginal child-spirit concepts, a father or other relative is said to ""find"" a
child, see Merlan 1986). Such examples present themselves more or less as idioms with
respect to given meanings, in that the contribution to meaning cannot be neatly
apportioned as between particle and finite verb. But such combinations have some
degree of semantic transparency that can be assessed by looking at the meaning the finite
verb may have as sole constituent of a verb phrase, and by comparing the various pairings
of the particle with other finite verbs.
  Most of the finite verbs that occur in such combinations as birdij gi- can occur by
themselves as the main constituent in verbal constructions of the first type discussed
above; and from their occurrence there, an independent lexical meaning can be
established. By itself, the verb gi- means 'to put'; and na- 'to see'. We can therefore
172 Chapters appreciate that with respect to the combination birdij gi-, the second combination birdij
 na- may be analyzed as 'finding by seeing', or the like. But there seems to be no revealing
 way to further analyze the relationship between birdij and gi- in semantic terms.
    In other cases of limited co-occurrence of particle with finite verbs, we may speak more
 confidently of the semantic contribution and relation to each other of the constituents.
 For instance, the particle gayardung 'run' may occur with verbs of motion ya- 'go' and
 nyanga- 'come', but we are able to say that the particle expresses a manner of movement,
 while the finite verbs differ in directionality.
    It is not usual for a particle to commonly occur with more than several different finite
 verbs. An important grammatical feature that such alternative combinations may
 contribute to, or directly instantiate, is transitivity at the clause level. For example, the
 particle birriwirlib 'roll, tumble' with either main motion verb, 'go' or 'come' may only
 occur as part of an intransitive clause structure. However, with either wudba- (which by
 itself means 'to throw') or bu-, the combination can only occur within a transitive clause
 structure (with appropriate pronominal adjuncts, etc.). There are many ways in
Wardaman that such intransitive/transitive pairs or sets with the same verb particle are
 implemented, and sometimes here an (at least partial) semantic compatibility between
particle and co-occurring finite verb can be discerned by examining the set of possible
pairings into which each particle may enter (as above, the two pairings with birdij). For
instance, two common combinations into which the particle bard enters are: bard wudba-
 'throw down', and bard we- 'fall down'. From this can be discerned some of the
semantic components associated with bard rather than with the finite verb, i.e., trajectory
downwards. In another example, we find the combinations barlarra gi- 'to hide', and
barlarrajingi- 'to hide, be in hiding', where the lexical semantics of the finite verbs ('to
put' and 'to be, sit' respectively) are expanded into the difference between transitive and
intransitive clause structures. Compare the different possibilities of pairing with bod-ba
 'visit': with na- 'see', it means 'to visit'; with nyanga- (otherwise 'to come') the pair
means 'come to visit', and with lawu- (otherwise 'to reach, get to, catch up to, fetch'),
something like 'visit with'.
   There are many instances where alternative pairing does not change transitivity value,
but rather subtly alters verbal semantics. The particle birrij-ba with bu- (by itself, 'hit,
strike') means 'to knead'; but with me- (otherwise, 'to get') means 'to stir'. Both finite
verbs determine transitive clause-level structures. Similarly, bag-ba with ya- (by itself
 'to go') may be translated simply 'to break'; but with we- (ordinarily, 'to fall') may be
translated 'fall and break, break in falling'. Both of the finite verbs here instantiate
intransitive clause structures.
   So far most of the examples have involved pairings in which the particle appears more
specialized than the finite verb in its lexical semantics. We may say this on the basis that
verbs like gi- and bu- occur in combination with many different particles, and in many
instances the semantic contribution of the verb amounts to little more than the
specification of general type of action, or minimally, determination of the transitivity of
the clause. There are, however, pairings with what might be described as semantically
more specific lexical verbs, which co-occurring particles seemingly further qualify. Here
the verbs contribute not only transitivity, but a more specialized lexical meaning. An
                                                                   Categories of the finite verb 173
example in point in the verb bewe- 'to step on, tread upon', which has been found paired
with particles bengmarla in the meaning 'to snap, break', and gilywaj in the meaning 'to
trample'. See 8.19. for more detailed examination of causativization and other transitive/
intransitive pairings.
  Insofar as a finite verb appears to only specify transitivity and contribute little to
predicate semantics, it is convenient to consider it an ""Auxiliary"" verb. In interlinear
glosses, many finite verbs in particular constructions are so labelled. However, as we
have seen, there is a variable degree to which finite verbs in particle* verb constructions
may be defined as having only an auxiliary function. Partly by examining alternative
pairings with the same particle, additional degrees of predicate function and semantic
contribution can be discerned.
  It can also be seen that particles function to specify verbal semantics. The more fully
they do so, the more limited they are in their possible pairings with finite verbs. The
more generalized they are semantically, the greater are their possibilities of co-occurrence
with a variety of lexical verbs. There is a point at which we want to call the more general
modifiers ""adverbs"", and as has already been indicated at several places in this
description, there is no absolute line that can be drawn in Wardaman between verb
particles and adverbs — both, for example, can form adclausal complements, but the
latter are more limited in this respect. It is, however, useful to recognize a general
difference between the two word-classes in the terms given.
  Finite verbs fall into several different formal classes. There is a small but very
important set of 15 or 16 CV roots (see 8.16.), all of these are of high frequency both as
independent verbs, and most also as auxiliaries or supporting predicates in particle+ verb
constructions. These are ba- 'burn, thirst', bu- 'hit', ga- 'take', gi- 'put', la- 'bite', lu-
'cry', me- 'get', na 'see', ni- 'bring', nge- 'sing', ngu- 'eat, consume', we- 'fall', wo-
'give', να- 'go', yo- 'spear', and yu-, copula (see 8.20.). The verb ""go"" is so irregular
that it is not particularly useful to classify it as a CV- root, hence the alternative 15 or 16.
  There are finite verbs of two syllables which are morphologically unanalyzable, or
monomorphemic. Examples are bewe- 'tread on', buju- 'to dig', gaju- 'to rise, grow',
gerle- 'to taste', gerne- 'to take away from'; gewu- 'to shoo, chase away', gila- 'to water,
douse', ginye- 'to cook'Jingi- to sit', linyje- 'to cut', megbe- 'to snap' golo- 'to laugh
at', menyje- 'to feel', mowo- 'to steal', ngenyje- 'to choke', nyanga- 'to come', waja-
'to leave', yana- 'to do, say', yeli- 'to call out', and yonga- 'to farewell'. Some of these
show a suggestively similar final syllable, e.g., the final -(ny)je- in linyje- 'cut', menyje -
'feel', and ngenyje- 'choke', indicating that this may be historically analyzable.
  Some verbs of two syllables, and all of three syllables or more, are morphologically
analyzable into two parts, a variable initial element and a small set of inseparable, final
auxiliary-like elements. These include the pairs -ma and -ba which are in complementary
distribution depending on the stem-final element; -wu and -bu, also in complementary
distribution; a small number of verbs with final element -ma, suggesting that this also
may be historically separable; a small number of verbs with final syllable -rla some of
which contrast with verbs which lack this element, and on the basis of which the final
syllable may be seen as a transitivizing element; and a few verbs which contain a final
syllable ->·/- (post-nasal -ji-), identical with what is elsewhere the reflexive-reciprocal
174 Chaptersmarker, but which here must be defined as a formal marker of a small class of
mediopassive verbs.
  Where the syllable -ma occurs, the initial element may be analyzed as ending in any
segment but a stop; the shape -ba follows stops. Examples are: giirrg-ba- 'sleep',
gayg-ba-' shout', barlirrg-ba-' sweep', bidbid-ba-' twirl firedrill', borlorrod-ba-' spread
o\A\jongorog-ba- 'yawn' Jornog-ba- 'fill up', lorrod-ba- 'sharpen', mowoj-ba- 'sneak
away', wud-ba- 'throw'; yerrb-(b)a- 'be ashamed', yid-ba- 'sharpen', andyurrg-ba-
'feel'. Examples with final -ma- axe:jong-ma-' kiss' Jorl-nia-' kick', nmrndi-nia-' mind,
look after', newerr-tna- 'be hungry', nginy-nta- 'help', ngorr-nia- 'grind', ngunyang-
ma- 'knead', warrang-nia- 'swear', warrgany-ma- 'mess up', born-nia- 'bathe, wash',
and others. This final syllable, -ba or -nia, is probably to be seen as historically relatable
to the final particle suffix of the same allomorphy (11.1.2.). Such a relationship is
supported by the fact that there are some forms with this final syllable which are inflecting
verbs, or alternatively may function as verb particles, e.g., finite ngorlog-ba-, and particle
ngorlogba; or inflecting born-nia-, and particle bornborn 'bathe'.
  The shape-ΗΊί occurs after non-nasal sonorants, while -bu occurs after stops and nasals.
Examples of each are: bel-wii- 'slice', jewu- 'show', lawn- 'get, fetch, reach'; versus
lid-bu- 'sew', /wr/z-im- 'make^yerrenggej-bii- 'rummage, make a mess of, jarram-bu-
'look iar'Jinjin-bu- 'give work to, lay tasks upon', dem-bu- 'peck at'. Historically, this
final element is probably to be related to the finite independent verb bu-, but cannot be
synchronically identified with it, as their past tense suffixes differ (e.g., bel-wu-rri 'he
sliced it' versus bu-ndi' he hit it').
  The few verbs which end suggestively, for the purposes of historical analysis, in -rna
are: jomarna- 'to finish off, ledbarna- 'see', and wojbarna- 'listen'. This may be
relatable to na- 'see'.
  The verbs which end in -rla, some of which also contrast with stems which lack the
final syllable, are the following:
gayg-ba-        'call out'(intransitive) vs.       gayg-ba-rla-     'call out to'
biyima-rla-     'inflate' (transitive)
dagba-rla-      'have' (transitive)
wema-rla-       'vomit' (something) vs.            wentiyi-         'vomit'
  The small class of verbs called semantically ""Mediopassive"", and which are
constructionally intransitive, includes a number which do not contrast with a paired
transitive verb, but a small number that do, however, as follows.
jawe-yi-        'be tired'
lo-yi-          ' dance'
jerri-yi-        'be cold'
la-yi-           'die'
garrany-jiyi-   'grow'
worlgbi-yi-     'work for, do work for'vs.         worlg-ba-        'roil'
burla-yi-        'lie, tell lies, be a liar' vs.   burla-ma-        'lie to'
wali-yi-        'be jealous of               vs.   wali-na-         'be jealous towards'
wenuyi-         'vomit'                   vs.      weniarla-        'vomit' (something)
                                                                 Categories of the finite verb 175  This element must evidently be seen historically as related to the reflexive-reciprocal
marker, which intransitivizes the predicate where subject and object are co-referential or
overlap, to create a formally intransitive clause. The segmentation of the form ""to grow""
is tentative, for it appears that there has been doubling of the mediopassive element.
  A final, isolated final syllable is equivalent to the CV verb ""to consume"", and occurs
ingun-ngu- 'drown'.","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199]"

6.5. Genitive independent pronouns
In addition to ""base"" and Dative series pronominal forms, there is a distinct Genitive
series, with the following forms:
                SG               DUAL                    NSG
1               nganinggin       yawunggin               ngarmgun.gin
                                                         yirrugun.gin
2               yinggawun                                nurrugun.gin
3               gungan.gin                               wurrugun.gin  The genitive element in this series (except for 2SG) is evidently -gin (see 11.4.), and it
would appear that, historically, this series was built on the Dative, but has subsequently
become formally independent of the latter.
  The genitive series serves: adnominally, to mark the pronominal possessor, sometimes
in conjunction with a free Dative form of the same propositus person; to mark that a
                                        Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 119
contextually understood or specifiable, but lexically unspecified, nominal is possessed.
Such a ""headless"" Genitive phrase functions itself as predicate argument. The Genitive
pronouns, as attributives and as arguments in their own right, may be inflected for the
full range of nominal case endings, as exemplified with 1SG:
     Absolutive                 nganinggin
     Ergative                   nganinggin-yi
     Dative                     nganinggin-gu
     Locative                   nganinggin-ya
     Allative                   nganinggin-garr
     Ablative                   nganinggin-ba
     Dissociative               nganinggin-gunya
     Source                     nganinggin-gunba
     Originative                nganinggin-jila
  In keeping with the fact that Genitive pronouns may by themselves function as core
arguments, they may be appropriately translated in some contexts as ""on me"", ""from me"",
and the like; that is, express personal reference, rather than being modifiers. The
following exemplify the different uses of the Genitive forms:(221) dalgirrig        ya-0-jingi-n                 nganinggin-ya
      lean             3-3SG-AUX-PRES               1SGGEN-LOC
       'He is leaning on me'.
  Here Locative-marked 1SG Genitive pronoun is non-attributive complement of the
particle plus auxiliary construction meaning ""lean on"", which ordinarily has Locative
complement.(222) nganinggin-yi       ngabobu-yi        duwu-ma           0-bu-ndi

       'Let the grog be, leave it, get meat and food, tobacco and matches as we always
       get ours, food for the children, live without grog like us'.
  In (223) the Genitive pronoun yirrugun.gin serves as attributive of a nominal phrase
(presumably ""meat, food"" etc. actually ellipsed within the prosodic line, which ended
with the possessive pronoun in the original utterance). The speaker resumes with the
120 Chapter 6phrase ""food for the children"". Further examples illustrating a variety of points are all
drawn from a single text:(224) nganinggin           yibiyi         wonggo 0-jarram-bu-rri  nganu   ngawun
      1SGGEN-ABS           father-ABS     neg    3SG-look for-PST 1SG DAT no

        two-ABS         [Saturday] ISO GEN-ABS father-ABS 3SG-cry-PST 1SGDAT
        '[For] two Saturdays my father cried for me'.
  Both examples have Genitive pronouns in modifier function. Notice that both clauses
are syntactically Absolutive-Dative, that is, with oblique complement of ""look (for)"" and
""cry (for)"", as is characteristic for both.(226) guyamin         ngabobu             nganinggin            ngorlog-ba

        'My two grandmothers used to sit and talk to me'.
  Note the order in the phrase ""my two grandmothers"", numeral-modified-modifier (and
compare with 227); and also that, with explicit numeral ""two"", dual marking is foregone.
This frequently happens, but sometimes dual marking occurs in the presence of numeral.(227)   nganinggin             mulurru                yi-barnang

  (227) is organized in prosodic lines as originally spoken. See 10.3. - 10.4. for
discussion of ordering in the noun phrase, and the possessive noun phrase in particular.(228)   0-yana-rri   go          mulurru-wu                    yi-ngawuyu      go

        'He told the old woman, my father's mother's sister-in-law ...'
  The modifying phrase which specifies the identity of the old woman (""my father's

clause, but rather is an Absolutive identifying phrase with Dative possessor phrase. The

ordering in that phrase is modified-Genitive modifier, which as can be seen from the
other examples given above, alternates rather freely with the reverse order.(229) nganinggin           badbad            wurr-gi-ndi-ya
      1SGGEN-ABS           cover             3NSG-put-PST-NAR

       'They beat him severely and he left he died on my account, only his children
       called me a sorcerer'.
  This example shows a Dissociative-marked Genitive pronoun meaning ""on account of
me, on my account"". In the context, the speaker's meaning was not literally that the man
referred to had died on her account, but there is here rather more complex attribution of
""authorship"". The speaker's meaning was that the man's children said that he had died
on account of her — they alleged she had poisoned him; thus the ""voice"" of the clause
""he died on my account"" is that of the man's accusing relatives, yi-geye-mulu, somewhat
unsually in this syntactic context, occurs in Absolutive (rather than Ergative) form.
However, that may be linked to the fact that the speaker paused briefly following the
phrase ""his children"", perhaps considering how to put the unpleasant accusation. (In the
first line, digirrij may mean either (completely) dead, or as we say, ""near-dead"",
""half-dead"", or the like. Here, the meaning is that the beating was severe, but that the
man was able to carry himself off).
  Finally, when Genitive pronouns are used in headless phrases, it is rather common that
the possessive phrase be expanded by use of a complementary free Dative pronoun of
the same person and number (see also 10.4.). For example, a typical verbless predication
of possession is of the following sort:(231) nana             nganinggin nganu  /                     gungan.gin gunga
      that-ABS         1SGGEN-ABS 1SGDAT                       3SGGEN-ABS 3SG DAT
       'That is mine'/'That is his, hers'.
  An example of this kind of Absolutive Genitive, which in context occurred as object
of the verb ""put"", is:(232) nganinggin           nganu             ngajbang-bi

6.6. Derivatives of ""base"" pronouns: Article-suffixed and ""first""
     free formsThe base pronominal forms, Absolutive and Ergative, in their functions as explained in
6.1. above, commonly occur suffixed with the article -hi ~ -wi. The article suffix (as
described in 5.7.), when added to a non-nominal part of speech, serves to nominalize or
make more concrete its reference; and when added to a nominal form, does something
like make its reference more definite, in a way that is often best translatable by English
substitutive ""one"" (""big one"", etc.). Yet the article cannot be regarded as a form that
stands in place of an ellipsed lexical expression (as English substitutive ""one"" does).
Rather, in keeping with the fact that Wardaman nominals of adjectival kind very
commonly constitute a nominal phrase by themselves (see Chapter 4), what the article
does is to suggest more concretely a domain of reference of which the current nominal
token is ""one"". The article suffix thus performatively marks, not ellipsis, but
definitivization.
  The article suffix is commonly added to free pronouns, both Absolutive and Ergative
(see an example of the latter in (199)). Following the Ergative suffix, the article
invariably has the shape -wi; thus the Ergative-article sequence is yi-wi, as in 1SG
ERG-ART ngayug-ji-wi, etc. However, in the Absolutive series we find apocope of the
final vowel of the 1SG form before the article suffix, the occurring form being not
ngayugu-wi but ngayug-bi. For the sake of clarity the article-suffixed Absolutive forms
are listed:
     1SG              ngayug-bi
     2SG              yinyang-bi
     l IN DU          yawung-guya-wi
     1 IN PL          ngarrug-bi
     1EXNSG           yirrug-bi
     2NSG             nurrug-bi (also nurrug-(g)uya-wi DU, nurrug-bulu-wi PL)
     3SG              narnaj-bi
     3DU              narnaj-guya-wi
     3PL              narnaj-bulu-wi, narnaj-ganung-bi
 With the free pronouns, the article suffix usually contributes an emphatic element of
meaning reinforcing the pronoun's reference, something like ""I myself, as in:(233) nga-gaju-wa               ngayug-bi
       ISG-arise-FUT            1SG-ABS-ART
      Ί for one will get up', Ί myself will get up'.
  In comparison with this, as observed in 6.1., the essentially third person form ngajbang
which may occur with any person/number form, is often understood to express a different
nuance, ""I alone"", or ""I by myself.
  Built on the base stems, and showing the same slight differences from the latter as the
article-suffixed forms, is a series which expresses that the referent of the pronoun is
                                          Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 123""first"". This series is formed with the suffix -baywa ~ -waywa. It is syntactically
anomalous in that it often is understood as in construction with a transitive subject
pronominal form in the verb, in which instance one normally expects any external
pronoun to be Ergative-marked. The ordinary interpretation of these forms, however,
appears to be as in construction with the agent pronominal in transitive clauses, despite
the absence of Ergative marking, as in:(234)   ngayug-baywa              ngawun-da-rri
        1SG ABS-first             1 SG/3NSG-see-PST
        Ί saw them first' [I before others saw them].(235)   namaj-baywa               ngan-da-rri
        3SG ABS-first             3SG/lSG-see-PST
        'He saw me first' [he before others].
  Like the article suffix, this suffix is final, and follows any overtly-marked dual number:
e.g., nurrug-(g)uya-waywa 'you two first'.
  This suffix has also been found with certain primary adverbs to create secondary ones
which seem to have a somewhat more explicit relational sense, e.g., fromjaburru 'ahead,
in front', jaburrung-baywa 'first, ahead of anyone'. It is also suffixed to nominal stems
to create more adverbial forms of manner: yi-bam-baywa 'head-first', banggin-baywa
'back-first'.","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]"

6.2. Independent pronouns: Base formsIn Wardaman, as in Wakiman (Cook 1987, Chapter 5), a basic distinction is to be made
between what may be called ""base"" and ""general oblique"" (6.3.) free pronominal
categories. ""Base"" forms are the foundational forms of two case categories in free
pronouns. With zero inflection to the base, they fill Absolutive case-functions; that is,
they serve in intransitive subject and transitive object functions within the clause, in
conjunction with the obligatory pronominal prefixes which mark these categories in the
verb. With Ergative inflection, base forms fill transitive subject function within the
clause, in conjunction with the pronominal prefixes marking this function. Thus two case
categories, Absolutive and Ergative, that from the point of view of case-marking in the
noun serve quite different functions, from the perspective of (historical) pronominal
morphology differ principally by outer inflection. A plausible historical inference may
be that the distinction between Absolutive and Ergative categories in the free pronouns
on the base pronominal series may be a relatively recent development.
  In the base pronouns and elsewhere in the person-marking system, there is no formal
distinction between dual and plural in the person categories lEX(clusive), and 2NSG
(nonsingular); there is a single form which may optionally be dual-suffixed (see 5.6.2.)
in order to make a distinction between dual and plural, but this is morphologically
secondary. In addition, there is generally no formal distinction between dual and plural
in third person categories of all kinds (i.e., neither in demonstratives, nor in the
pronominal prefixes in the verb).
  Though there are thus simply 'nonsingular' pronominal base forms in 1EX, 2NSG and
3NSG categories, there are also to be distinguished first and second person singular base
forms, a 1 Dual category, and a 1 Inclusive Nonsingular category. Leaving aside third
person forms entirely for the moment, the base pronominal forms in 1 and 2 person
categories are:
108 Chapter 6
                Singular             Dual                Nonsingular
1                ngayngii         yawimg-guya            ngarrug
1EX                —                  —                  yirrug(guya)
2               yinyang                                  nur rug (guy a)
  1SG is ngoyugu, 2SGyinyang. Clearly the notion of ""inclusion"" does not apply to
1SG, but only to forms that signal 1SG + 2. There are three nonsingular categories that
all belong to one form class in the sense that they all exhibit a final syllable -rrug, where
the rr (based on this, and evidence from the pronominal prefixes in the verb) is clearly
to be taken as a nonsingular element. However, ngarrug has a different status from the
other two in that it is inherently more than dual, and cannot be suffixed for dual number.
It contrasts with UN DU yawung-guya, which (based on evidence from the general
oblique or Dative form) appears to have a stemyawu- with epenthetic nasal before the
dual suffix. The forms 1EXNSG yirrug and 2NSG nitrrug may optionally be
dual-suffixed to explicitly indicate dual number, for as noted there is no difference
between dual and plural categories in 1EX, 2NSG and 3NSG pronominals in the verb.
1EXNSG and 2NSG pronouns may also be plural-suffixed (5.6.3.): yirrug-bulu,
mirrug-bulu.
  The Ergative free pronouns are transparently built on the stems given above by
suffixation of the usual Ergative marker:                Singular            Dual                 Nonsingular
1               ngayug-ji        yawung-guya-yi          ngarrug-ji
                    -                 -                  yirrug-ji
2               yinyang-nyi           —                  nurrug-ji
  With Ergative suffix UN DU form isyawung-guya-yi. The 2NSG and 1EXNSG forms
may, of course, be dual suffixed nurrug-(g)icya-yi andyirrug-(g)uya-yi. A few minor
remarks on the realization of some of these forms are required.
  Although careful pronunciation reveals ngayug-ji as 1SG ERG form, common
realizations include [ngayig-ji}t and ones in which the velar stop loses a great deal of its
occlusive quality, and may be deleted altogether, up to and including [ngayiji]. And
though careful pronunciation reveals (Absolutive) 2SG yinyang, there is a strong
tendency for the α to be raised and fronted following the high front vowel and palatal
nasal, so that a common realization is \yinyeng]. Finally, though the 1EXNSG ABS and
ERG forms yirrug and yirrug-ji are realized with second vowel as it, with the addition
of the dual suffix there is a tendency for the second vowel to lose its rounding and to
assimilate in frontness to the first vowel, yielding realizations approximating
\yirriguyoyi],
  Absolutive pronouns in the function of transitive object of a predicate occur in
conjunction with object pronominal prefixes in the verb marking the object; absolutive
pronouns in the function of intransitive subject, and Ergative pronouns in the function of
transitive subject, occur in conjunction with subject pronominals in the verb. Reflexive
and reciprocal constructions, as is true for other kinds of nominals, require that their
subjects be expressed by Absolutive forms of the independent pronouns.

  These examples illustrate the grammatical and textual contribution of the independent
forms. (186) and (191) illustrate verbless predications, the former with adjectival
nominal, the latter with ""having"" construction as the predicates. In such instances the
free pronouns function by themselves as arguments of the predicate, for subject person
can never be marked directly on the non-verbal predicate in Wardaman (and thus these
constructions contrast markedly with semantically adjectival-predicate and other similar
construction types in southern Arnhem languages of the putative Kunwinykuan group,
see e.g., Merlan 1983: 57-59).
  Elsewhere the free Absolutive pronoun serves to call attention to the person it
designates, also obligatorily marked (as transitive object, or intransitive subject) in the
verbal pronominal complex. (185) is focalized ""They blamed me"" (as compared with
someone else, or contrary to expectation, etc.). (187) illustrates that the free pronoun
functions to make possible qualification of the subject with nominal suffixes such as -biji
Only'. (188), (190) and (195) are examples in which the contrast between two nominals
is expressed with both overt, direct contrast being a sub-category of special salience
which the free pronouns are characteristically used to mark.
  Examples with Ergative case-marked free pronouns are:(196) gurru        girdibun-barra   yirr-(y)ingbe-wuya                  gangga-rlan

  Note here the special anti-benefactive sense of 3SG Dissociative pronoun here,
expressing that ""their"" constant coming and going was a detriment to a major clausal
participant (see 5.2.7.), here presumably to be understood as loosely cohesive with 1SG
free and bound pronominal person (and 1INDU of the previous clause).(199) wonggo            yiniburr-warrang-ma           namaj-(j)i-wi         yinyang-nyi

        '""Wild grape"" belongs to blue-tongue [i.e., is its habitual food], it's for people
        too,WE[lEXNSG]eatit'.
  These examples show that within the transitive subject function, use of free Ergative
pronouns corresponding to subject pronominals in the verb emphasizes the salience of
the transitive subject category, whether in the context of a complete reversal of
participants with respect to subject and object roles in adjacent clauses (197), (199); the
contrast of two entities in different clauses with respect to something, where only one
may be cast grammatically as transitive subject (200); and also seemingly more subtle,
partly grammatical contrasts such as that in (198). In that complex example, in the first
clause 1SG acts on 2SG, ""I stopped you""; the second clause, complement to the first,
expresses what ""I"" stopped ""you"" from doing, i.e., from giving away ""our"" things freely;
the third clause, with 1SG ERG pronoun in first place, shows a return to 1SG as the agent
category, thus contrasting with 2SG of the previous clause. However, first person was
initially agent, in the first clause, and this seemingly accounts for the suffixation of 1SG
ERG pronoun with the ""defocusser"" -wan, which normally occurs on nominal topics (and
sometimes also on other topical constituent units, see 10.3.7. for details). That is,
112 Chapter 6
ERG-marking on 1SG free pronoun marks a change in agent from 2SG of the previous
clause, hence a contrast; but the resumed 1SG agent is topical, not new, hence
""defocussed"". See further 10.11. for comments on pronominal topics.
  So far no third person ""base"" forms have been mentioned. The majority of third-person
referring forms are demonstrative pronouns, that is, they refer with locational contrast as
an inherent element of their meaning (primary spatial contrasts, designating in terms of
relative distance categories with reference to which the textual usage of some of these
forms must be understood). There is only one set of third person forms which is not
inherently demonstrative in this way, and this is a set with stem narnaj evident in all
forms. These are as follows:
                Absolutive                     Ergative
3 SG            narnaj                          narnaj-(j)i
3DU             narnaj-guya                    narnaj-guy a-yi
3PL             narnaj-bulu                    narnaj-bulu-yi
   The forms are entirely regular. It is artificial to make a distinction between 3DU and
3PL here, in fact, on morphological grounds there is no distinction to be made even
between singular and nonsingular: the single stem narnaj is inflected with ordinary dual
and plural number forms. It is of interest, however, to note that an additional nonsingular
form with suffixal element -ganung, i.e., 3NSG namaj-ganung, has been recorded. This
suffix is also found with some of the demonstrative stems, see 7.2. All of these third
person forms are frequently found (in both Absolutive and Ergative case-functions) with
article-suffix (see 5.7.), e.g., narnaj-bi 3SG ABS; narnaj-guya-yi-wi 3DU ERG, etc. Use
of these forms is illustrated in the following examples:(201)    wonggo      yanggun-bu-n       wurren                         worlog-ba
        neg          3SG/3NSG-AUX-PRES child-ABS                       wash-PS

        3-3SG-AUX-RR-PRES self-ABS-ART
        'She is not washing the children, she is washing herself.
  (Note that 3NSG object ""children"" is marked in the verbal pronominal prefix, but that
the external nominal wurren is formally singular; it is not uncommon that PL not be
marked on the noun, though it is more usually marked on human as opposed to
non-human nouns.) Here the 3SG base form narnaj functions to make salient the
intransitive subject/reflexive object category by contrast with another object
(""children""), in the same way that has been illustrated for the free (first and second)
person forms.
  A third person Ergative-marked form was illustrated in (199) above.(202)    wonggo        yinga-na-n                      gurlurrg        gija     narnaj

                                           Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 113  In (202), again as in many of the examples with free person forms, the contrastive
function of narnaj is associated with the switch of participants in relation to clause
function in adjacent clauses. A comparison is emphasized between the relation of
transitive subject ""I"" of the first clause to the ""him"" of that clause, with the ""he"" of the
second, by the use ofnamaj.
  Finally concerning third person forms, it needs to be mentioned that there is a non-
demonstrative, third person pronominal base ngajbang, which may usually be translated
""self or ""selves"", and which generally serves the emphatic function which that
translation suggests. In addition to being approximately equivalent to the ""myself of ""I
myself will do it"" (as contrasted with another's doing it), it very often has, like the English
emphatic form, the meaning ""by oneself, alone"". This form may be suffixed for dual or
plural number with the usual suffixes, but it may also function without such overt number
suffixation in apposition to nonsingular nominals, as in ngajbang-bi ngabobu-mulu
yinggi 'your father's mothers and mother's brothers themselves', ABS. And though
basically a third person category, it may function in apposition to any person category,
as the following examples illustrate:(203)   narnaj-bi          0-yanggi          ngajbang-bi
        3SGABS-ART         3SG-goPST         self-ABS-ART

        'These women of yinyganymirra subsection live separately, by themselves, and
        these men of yanymirra subsection live by THEMselves'.(206)    duba    ya-0-jingi-n            ngajbang-bi             yi-bayin-barra-yi

        'And their old women, the two of them by themselves [put it]'.
  In (207) a complex ellipsis of a predicate expression is the reason for the apparently
fragmentary syntax; but the much larger context is not relevant here, the point being
simply to illustrate the ""self form with dual and case suffixes.
114 Chapter 6
6.3. Dative or ""general oblique"" free formsContrasting with the 'base' pronominal series on which Absolutive and Ergative forms
are built is a Dative or general oblique series, with wide-ranging functions. These forms
have already been extensively exemplified in this grammar because of their ubiquity.
Forms in this series are:
                SG                DUAL                   NSG
1SG             nganu             yawu                   ngarrugu
                                                         yirrugu
2SG             yinggi                                   nurrugu
3SG             gunga                                    wurrugu  As elsewhere in the person system, there is no morphological difference between dual
and plural stem forms for the categories 1 EX, 2 and 3 nonsingulars. There is one form
in each category which may be dual-suffixed to explicitly distinguish dual from (other)
nonsingulars: yirrugu-wuya, nurrugu-wuya, and wurrugu-wuya. Though the 1IN
category is morphologically of the same series as these, it is inherently more than dual
nonsingular, and cannot be dual-suffixed. The UN DU form, yawu, may probably be
taken as the basic stem (which, as shown in 6.1., is nasal-augmented and dual-suffixed
in the ""base"" series ioyawung-guya). The 3SG form, as described in 3.9., is often realized
as [g ]. As in the ""base"" series, there is commonly fronting and unrounding of the second
stem vowel in the 1EXNSG form to something approximating [yirrlgu].
  The Dative series fulfills a set of functions within the clause which are all characterized
by relative obliqueness of the pronominal relation to the predicate, as compared with the
major syntactic (verbally-marked) clause functions. They specify the pronominal object
complement in many intransitive clauses, including in clauses of ""saying to"" which are
normally, but not invariably, intransitive; they specify the pronominal benefactive (and
sometimes also, semantically ""anti-benefactive"") complement of the intransitive and
transitive (excepting ditransitive) clause; and they mark possession in agreement with a
Dative-marked pronominal possessor, or otherwise in apposition to a free Genitive
pronominal possessor; they mark the pronominal complement of adverbs of location and
other (temporal) position. Examples in these functions are:(208)    yi-jurn-nya  nga-gi-we       gunga   wurre-wu                   bingmarla
         YI-face-LOC ISG-put-FUT     3SG DAT child-DAT                   (yellow) paint
        nga-gi-we    gunga      yanjigbe    nganu                        yi-borrordin-gurne
        ISG-put-FUT 3SGDAT 3SGgoFUT 1SGDAT                               YI-pretty-CAUS
        Ί have to put paint on the child's face, I have to put it on him so he will look
        nice forme'.
  The first Dative series pronoun is gunga, which constitutes a phrase with wurre-wu;
note that the exact place (""face"") where the paint is to be put may not be analyzed as part
of the same phrase, but is treated separately by Locative case-marking. The second
Dative pronoun is 1SG nganu, which is semantically benefactive (""for me"") or ""ethical

Dative"" (""on, in relation to, to me""), and in any event marks a pronominal complement
which has a rather oblique relation to the predicate, here ""go"".(209) nga-jaba-rri    wujaban       darni                nganinggin           yilania
       ISG-build-PST house-ABS yonder                    mine-GEN-ABS          reckon

        ' I built my own house over there, maybe the old woman will come and keep
        me company'.
 Here the 1SG oblique nganu is complement of ""come"", and occurs in construction with
Dative-marked particle_y/rr-/7ii7 'company, keep company'.(210)   nyilg           ye-0-wenwen           ngarrugu
        sprinkle        3-3SG-AUXrdp          1INPLDAT
        'It's sprinkling on us'.
  In (210) ngarrugu is obliquely linked to the particle plus auxiliary construction
""sprinkle"".(211) lay in            gangman              nu-yo              ngarrugu
      game-ABS          kangaroo-ABS         2NSG-spear         1INPL DAT
        ' You shoot a kangaroo for us'.
 In (211) Dative ngarrugu is the beneficiary of the imperative 'shoot'.(212) ngayugu wonggo    ngani-warrangnia wonggo      ngayugu
      1SGABS neg        2SG/lSG-swear     neg        1SGABS

        'Don't swear at ME, I'm not a wife to you, I'm your niece' [or, 'niece to you'].
  In (212) free pronouns are amply illustrated. There are two oblique forms, bothyinggi
'yours, to you'. Here, the Dative contrasts with what would normally be use of the free
Genitive pronoun fyinggawun 'yours', which very often occurs with the corresponding
Dative pronoun in apposition, see 6.4.). An attempt is made to render the difference
between Genitive and the use of Dative here by means of the translation e.g., ""wife to
you"" instead of ""your wife"", and implying a more indirect relation than is expressed by
means of the Genitive pronoun.(213) yirr-worlorbna-rri-ya         wurrugu          mernde-wu             bornborn-gu
      1EX NSG-fill-PST-NAR          3NSGDAT          European-DAT          bathe-DAT
        'We filled it up for the Europeans' baths' [or, 'for the Europeans to bathe'].
  Here 3NSG wurrugu occurs as benefactive complement of ""fill"", and as part of a more
complex construction, with Dative pronoun and modified Dative nominal (Europeans),
and further complemented by a Dative-inflected particle ""bathe"".

        'Two men yonder are coming asking for/to ask for tobacco he said to the white
         man Oh! you call out to the two of them, he said to him'.
  In (215), 3SG ΌΑΓgunga occurs as pronominal complement of the verb of saying, but
is associated with a Dative phrase ""white man"" which makes explicit the nominal
complement of the verb of saying. There is also 3NSG DAT pronoun as complement of
the verb gaygba-' to call out'.(216)   ngana-nja       guji      yawn
        3SGHT-go        first     1INDUDAT

  (216) illustrates UN DU Dative pronoun as complement oiguji 'first, in the first place,

  In 5.2.3. there occurred a number of examples of Dative pronouns in possessive
constructions, and these will not be further illustrated here. But see also 5.4.","[131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140]"
"11.4.2. Nominalized purpose complements (of finite verbs)The purposive complement derived from a finite verb is built on the nominalized form
of the stem with the suffix -yin (H.3.), and any major objective argument of the
complement in Dative case. Nominalized forms of finite verbs, like particles, cannot
inflect for person; and so here, as in particle purposive complements, subject-object
relations of the complement are understood in terms of the relations in the main clause.
The system of ""control"" from the main clause cannot, then, be viewed as a grammatically
highly explicit one, for interpretation of the same complement clause could vary with the
sense established in the main clause.
278 Chapter 11(668)   ma-nga-nyanga-n      yinggi                 ngorlog-ba-wu      jewu-yin

  (668) contains two purpose complements: the first, ngorlogbawu 'to talk'; the second,
a purposive nominalization of the finite verbjewu- 'show, teach' (a ditransitive clausal
predicate). Such a nominalized complementizer cannot, as already noted, be inflected
for person, and so there are two ways in which the (intended) subject-object relations of
the complement are understood: first, in relation to the sense conveyed by the
grammatical structure of the main clause; and second (optionally, and not realized here
in the complement) for the semantic object of the complement to be made explicit by a
Dative free pronoun. In this example, since ""I"" always come to ""you"" for talk, the
complement is understood to continue the same subject-object relations. The intended
object ""me"", however, could also be realized by 1SG DAT pronoun nganu.(669)   ya-wud-janga-n           jejbarla-yin                wu-munburra-wu
        3-3NSG-come-PRES         ask-NOM-PURP                WU-money-DAT
        'They are coming to ask for money'.
  In (669) the complement has nominalized form ofjejbarla- 'ask', and object of the
complement ""money"" in Dative case, as it would also normally be in a finite clause with
this predicate, the person asked for money the direct object. The person being asked is
not made explicit here, but could be a free Dative pronoun. Despite this possibility,
Purposive complements tend to be infrequent in the text material gathered, and the few
that occur are simple, usually having only one Dative-marked argument of the
complement clause. These Purpose complements are distinct from the Allative-marked
ones discussed in 12.4.3., however, in that the main clause predicate may be transitive.(670) ngan-jewu-rri              ginyi-yin [ginye-yi-yin]       mayi-wu

        'He showed me how to cook [the] food'.
  Just as in (669) where the main clause predicate was intransitive, in (670) the argument
structure of the main clause ditransitive verb jewu- is understood to apply to the
complement.
  The main clause may overtly consist of just a nominal argument with zero copula verb
of being or existence, as in the following two examples.(671) gilidji                     lorrodbi-yin               jimirndi-wu

        'He's knowledgeable about dancing / singing corroboree'.
  Informants produced alternatives to (672) with Dative-marked predicate loyi-wu, and
such ""dativization"" of the bare stem of finite verbs is occasionally found.
  Some elicited purpose complements of this kind seemed to be used in relation to a
general purpose, so that the construction could appear with no Dative-marked argument
in the complement clause.(673)   yanja              yo-yi-yin
        3SG go-PRES        spear-NOM-PURP
        'He is going to spear [something], spearing/hunting'.
  Finally, mention needs to be made of a Purposive formation possible with finite verbs
which, in terms of formal properties, makes them superficially similar to particles in that
they add the particle suffix form -ma, following a textually rare Purposive suffix of the
shape -ye-. The sole textual example of this construction that indicated its existence was
the following, with some surrounding context:(674)   dan-beng        wud-jingi-ndi-ya
        this-SSPEC      3NSG-sit-PST-NAR
        loye-ma

        what-Q-QQ               line dance-AB S
        wu-lo-yi-rri-ya
        3NSG-dance-MED-PST-NAR
        'They were here
        for dancing
        what kind of thing? murdu [name of a kind of women's line dance]
        they danced'.
  The larger context was a visit by a party of us women to a site mythologically associated
with ancestral female figures, who were said to come here to hold line-dances. As the
speaker spoke the first line she was indicating the place where the ancestral women sat,
""for dancing"". Despite its textual rarity, informants were readily able to produce such
forms in elicitation.
  The form of this Purposive complement is -ye-ma, regardless of the final vowel of the
finite stem. Especially following a stem-final a, there may be reduction of that vowel
plus -ye- to -e-, as in gurrgbe-ma 'for sleeping', i.e., the mid-vowel quality remains
unaltered. Also, as example (674) shows, following the mediopassive element -yi- we
do not find *loyi-ye-ma, but rather loye-ma 'for dancing'.
  Though the -ye-ma Purposive construction was exceedingly rare textually, it is
important to repeat that the Purposive construction with -yin was rare, too. This may
280 Chapter 11reflect the general syntactic flexibility possible in this language within the limits of finite
clause structure.
   Comparatively, the Purposive construction in -ye-ma is reminiscent of a Purposive
suffix recorded with Wakiman PARTICLES (Cook 1987: 235), which in that language
precedes the Dative suffix -gu. This combination of Purposive suffix plus Dative is
apparently of the form -ay-gu-, but there are problems in this segmentation. This
Purposive suffix in Wakiman FOLLOWS the particle suffix -ma in many forms, and
otherwise often occurs following an a which is the final segment of a particle root. Thus
it may be that the Purposive suffix here ought to be segmented (if definitively at all) as
-y- before -gu. However segmented, in the Wakiman Purposive sequence -ay- we have
a form which may perhaps be compared with the Wardaman purposive ending -ye-ma
(though the discrepancy in ordering of the Purposive suffix after -ma in Wakiman, and
before it in Wardaman, requires further consideration). On the other hand, both the
Wakiman form and Wardaman -ye- may be etymologically related to the Wardaman
nominalizer -yi-, although the exact nature of such correspondences would need to be
established. The form -ye-ma is unusual among Wardaman inflectional and derivational
morphemes in having a clear mid-vowel. Thus it cannot be treated as a synchronic
contraction, but must be regarded as a long-term morpho-syntactic retention in the
language.
  Purposive -ye-ma never occurred spontaneously with major complement objective
argument, but informants in elicitation produced dative objective arguments in relation
to the construction, as in (675), and (676).(675) jomarna-ye-ma           ya-wud-janga-n                    ngarrugu

10.4. The possessive noim phrase
A possessor noun or noun phrase may indicate possession in one of two main ways, or
sometimes, in a way that combines both possibilities.
  The pronominal possessor nay be marked solely by a member of the series of
independent genitive pronouns (6.5.):(568)   nganinggin       ngabobu            0-digirrijba-rri     na
        mine-ABS         FM-AIJS            3SG-die-PST          [now]
        'My father's mother has died now'.
 Alternatively, the pronominal possessor is often found to be marked by a form of the
Dative independent pronoun series (6.3.). Thus, in the following example, where we
might have nganinggin yi-jeyeman 'my promised spouse', there occurs:(569)   (nganburr-wo-ndi)         yi-jeyeman          nganu
        3NSG/lSG-give-PST         YI-promise          1SG-DAT
        'They gave me to my promised husband'.
  While it is usual for the dative pronoun to follow the possessed noun, examples of the
following kind are also found:(570)   guda               nganu            yiguyu
        where              1SG-DAT          mother-ABS
        'Where is my mother?
  Not infrequently, independent genitive possessor and independent dative are found
flanking the possessed nomiml:(571)   nganinggin       yi-jeyeman            nganu
        1SG-ABS          YI-promise-ABS        ISO-DAT
        '[They gave me to] mj promised husband'.
  The order as shown, with independent genitive pronoun to the left, and dative to the
right of the modified, is usual; but a few examples of dative to the left and genitive to the
right have been found. A cons luction of this sort may occur without an entity nominal,
in cases in which it has presumably been ellipsed:(572)   nganinggin       nganu               nganburr-wo-ndi

236 Chapter 10  While genitive pronoun may occur as sole word above standing for the ellipsed
nominal, it would not produce an acceptable sentence for the dative pronoun to occur
alone. Thus, in such doubled constructions (gungan.gin gunga 'his' etc.), the dative
pronoun is evidently syntactically dependent upon the genitive one.
  Where the possessor is nominal, it is usual if not universal for possession to be marked
both on the nominal possessor by suffixation of dative case, and further within the phrase
by the appropriate form of the dative independent pronoun (as illustrated in 5.2.3.). Thus,
for example:(573) jarrug            go                 galawarra-wu
      egg-ABS           3SG-DAT            spinifex pigeon-DAT
        'Eggs of the spinifex pigeon'.(574) giminy-gu              go            yibiwi
      [name]-DAT             3SG-DAT       father-ABS
        'Gimiyn's father'.(575)   mulurru-wuya-wu          yiguyu             wurrugu-wuya
        old woman-DU-DAT         mother-ABS         3NSGDAT-DU
        'The mother of the two old women'.
  As the above two examples illustrate (see also 5.2.3.), the possessor nominal may occur
either before or after the head noun. Further, the position of the dative pronoun is not
strictly fixed: it may occur following the possessed head noun, or following the dative-
marked possessor noun. Because of its ordering freedom, it may sometimes occur at some
remove from the dative-marked possessor noun with which it agrees:(576) yurnvarla-wu        yimbanay         yi-ngawuyu         go
      [ss]-DAT            [ssJ-ABS         YI-wife-ABS        3SG-DAT
        'Yurrwarla's wife is yimbanay' [i.e., for a male of yurrwarla subsection, the
         appropriate wife category is yimbanay].
  In 5.2.3. it was shown that the possessor of a possessor is also dative-marked (e.g.,
my-DAT mother's-DAT dog), and that particularly the nominal dative-marked possessor
tends to show agreement with a dative independent pronoun as well; also, that a
dative-marked possessor cannot be further inflected for case function within the clause.
Such further case function can be marked only on the possessed head of the nominal
phrase: ""my-DAT mother's-DAT dog-ERG (bit me)"", and the like.
  A few cases turned up in the corpus of collected texts which seem to suggest that
sometimes, a construction which is apparently semantically possessive can be formed
simply by juxtaposition of the possessed and possessor nominals, viz.:(577) nana              buda                  yingilga
      that-ABS          black plum-ABS        juice-ABS
        'The juice of the black plum'.
                                                         Issues in constituency and word order 237
  In considering certain similai constructions in Gooniyandi, McGregor (1990:253) has
suggested that they may be reg;irded not as possessive phrases, but as classifying ones, in
which the head noun is classified by type (in the above example, ""juice"" as of the specific
type ""plum juice""). It is attractive to consider such phrases as of some kind other than
possessive, because they differ from the usual possessive construction types. However,
several comments need to be made about this proposal for Wardaman. First of all, the purely
syntactic process of juxtaposition seems not to be highly productive: such examples as the
above stand out in the corpus as exceptions. There are however a few instances in which kin
relations, normally expressed by the usual kinds of possessive constructions, are simply
indicated by juxtaposition of the possessor to the kin term. Compare, for example, in the text
Gawalyan lines (50) and (55). The first is the expected kind of nominal possessive
construction: mulurru-wu bailet-gu yiguyu go Old woman Violet's mother', with third
person dative independent prc noun agreeing with the possessor (see next section for
discussion of phrases such as ""old woman X""). But in line (55) we find simply: dorij
bauet yiguyu wurruguya 'Dois and Violet's mother' with third person nonsingular
independent dative pronoun, and no dative marking on the possessor nominals, the two
personal names. Since this is not very common, it is probably best considered not a regular
kind of possessive construction, but an instance where the two personal names of those
readily understood to be the possessors are simply apposed to the possessed noun.
  Second, there are some fairly regular types of juxtaposition of what might be described
as generic and specific terms. Some of these seem to show a quite regular, even strict,
ordering, while others do not. These will be at least mentioned, if not analyzed, in 10.5.
  Finally, mention must be made of the typical syntactic treatment of body parts. Body
parts may function as arguments in all of the usual clause types, and may be marked by
pronominal prefix on the verb in their own right. For example, in a text about a fight
which developed between emu and brolga, there lies an explanation of why each of those
birds has its particular characteristics. Brolga savagely clobbered emu's two hands, so
that they are now small wings, and emu is flightless. One line says:(578) nungguru-wan         yanja                go              wudu        wudu       na_
      hand-ABS-DF          3-3SG-go-PRES        3SGDAT          little      little     [now]
        'And her hands [wings are very small now'.
  In (578), nunggum is the intransitive subject of the verb ""go"", which means in context
""become"" or ""have become"". Further on, emu retaliates, and meaning is expressed in
such a way that the body part she strikes is treated as direct object, and even more fully
concretized by addition of the uticle suffix:(579) gabarri            gumurtinji-yi      0-bu-ndi-ya               yi-bam-bi
      again              emu-ERG            3SG-hit-PST-NAR           YI-head ABS-ART
       'And then emu hit her head'.       nana              yi-bam             yanja               go      yi-belyangman
       that-ABS          YI-heai-ABS        3SG-go-PRES         3SG-DAT YI-red-ABS
       'And her head is red'.
238 Chapter 10  There is no overt expression of possession here, and with the salience of body parts in
the narrative it is quite possible for them to function in their own right as intransitive
subjects of the verb ""go"", here meaning ""to be characteristically"".
  It is perhaps more usual, however, for body parts to function syntactically in a way that
links them more directly with their owners.
  Consider a common circumstance in which a body part is the direct object of an action.
The third person object is not cross-referenced on the verb; it is realized by an
independent absolutive noun. The possessor is indicated on the verb, in the sort of
construction illustrated in (580):(580) ngan-linyje-rri             yi-jili
      3SG-cut-PST                 YI-hair-ABS
       'He cut my hair' ['he cut me hair'].
  In such an instance the ""hair"" is in the same role as its possessor, and I will regard such
cases as ones of possessive NP with pronominal possessor and nominal possessed, with
the possibility of realisation on the verb of the former only.
  There are certain characteristic expressions, largely of mental action or disposition, in
which a body part is the indispensable adjunct in the creation of the particular meaning:(581) yi-gulan           nga-we-ndi
      YI-ear-ABS         ISG-fall-PST
       Ί forgot'.
  These are not possessive constructions of the same kind as ""my hair"" (580), for
absolutive yi-gulan 'ear' is idiomatically combined as adjunct with the verb we- to create
the meaning 'forget'. Similarly:(582) mejern              ya-wud-jingi-n             lud-ba
      stomach-ABS         3-3NSG-be/sit-PRES         happy
       'They are happy'.
  Absolutive mejern 'belly, stomach' as adjunct of the particle plus AUX construction
ludba and jingi yields the meaning 'be happy'. Again, this is not a possessive
construction.
  There are instances of possession where a possessed body part is not in a major syntactic
function and thus cannot be marked on the verb, for example, in an intransitive
construction such as:(583) 0-we-ndi             (nganu)          nganinggin-ya        yi-bam-nya
      3SG-fall-PST         (3SG-DAT)        1SGGEN-LOC           YI-head-LOC
       'It fell [on me] on my head'.
  Here the possessive phrase consists minimally of pronominal possessor marked by
independent genitive pronoun and possessed nominal.

10.5. Generic-specific noun phrasesIt is very common in Wardamaa for people to be referred to in terms of membership of
a gender/age category. The mail commonly used gender/age-set terms are niarluga ' old
man' and nmlurru Old woman'. These, then, are generic terms which identify by the
gender/age- s et to which someone belongs, and individuals may be more closely
identified by juxtaposition of a personal name. The overwhelmingly common order is:
age-set term followed by perso lal name. Thus:(584) niarluga berru
       Old man Berru'.(585) nnihirru yidawim
      ' Old woman Yidawun'.
  Persons may also be specified by subsection term. Usually, the subsection term occurs
as sole lexeme of a phrase, aid thus there is no internal syntax. However, textual
examples have been found which show that when part of a more elaborate identifying
phrase, subsection terms occur between age-set term and personal name, thus:(586) niarluga yurrwarla dulu
      ' Old man Dulu of yumvarla subsection'.
 Persons may also be specified by gender/age-set term followed by a kin term, usually
one designating someone as kinsman from the speaker's perspective, thus:(587) niarluga gagung
      Old man grandfather' | father's father].
  It might be suggested that ir the above cases, we are dealing with constructions of
generic and specific terms, in Jiat order: the age-set (and subsection) terms designate
most generally, the personal names and kin terms specifically.
  Though it would not seem tha: there is a highly generalized Generic + Specific sy ntagm
operating widely over the nominal domain, certain other typical constructions may be
noted It is reasonably comiron for certain kinds of animals to be designated by a
construction which includes ths generic lexeme lay in 'meat, animal'. It would appear
that either Generic-Specific or Specific-Generic order may occur, e.g., either gaiignian
layin or layin gangnian 'kangaroo'. A textual example occurs in which the speaker is
describing the kinds of things she and others used to eat when young, as opposed to
European foods:(588) jarrug          go           nan-gu          galawarra-wu          lany-gu
       egg-ABS        3SG-DAT that-DAT             pigeon-DAT           animal-DAT
      'Eggs of the spinifex pigeon'.
240 Chapter 10  See (653) for a textual example of the order layin gangman. There are examples of the
generic mayin 'vegetable food' occurring with specific terms, with similar freedom or
ordering. And there are scattered other examples of what may or may not be semantically
generic-specific phrases, for example within a single tone group the following:(589) yi-munburra        0-wo-ndi           dangindi
      money-ABS          3SG-give-PST       paperbark-ABS
        'He gave him his money'.
  In context, it was evident that the particular contribution of dangindi, otherwise the
generic term for 'paperbark' and today used also to mean 'paper', was to make clear that
a particular station worker was paid off by being written a cheque, i.e., not money in
general, but paper (dangindi) that, exceptionally, is a kind of money (specifically, of >'/-
type as opposed to generic wumunburra 'money'). Possibly in other contexts
yimunburra dangindi might also be able to refer to 'paper money' (that is, it is likely that
""cheque"" and ""paper money"" might be referred to in the same way, as opposed to generic
wumunburra 'money'). In any case, it is unclear given the semantic contribution of the
noun class prefix yi- that we are dealing with a generic-specific construction of a kind
comparable to any of those discussed above. We may be dealing with a construction in
which yimunburra and dangindi are more or less semantically equivalent within the
linguistic context, where meanings were plainly being made about paying off a worker
with money. The above remarks on generic-specific and possibly related constructions
are obviously illustrative and suggestive rather than analytic.","[259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264]"

11.5. Source-marked causal complementsThe Source case-suffix is differently distributed in adclausal complements with particles
and nominalized forms of finite verbs. Both Source and Ablative case suffixes are
regularly found with particles, and the semantics of the two are generally but not
completely distinct. With particles, Source usually expresses cause or earlier condition
compared to a subsequent one, and Ablative generally has a somewhat more concrete
sense ""from"" whatever is designated by the particle.
  Nominalizations of finite verbs are rarely found Ablative-suffixed. That is, even
nominalized, finite verbs do not become susceptible of suffixation with what, in
Wardaman, remains throughout its range of functions a rather concrete, spatial case form.
Source is common with nominalizations of finite verbs, however, as a formative of causal
complements. As with purposive complement types described above, major arguments
of the complement clause are also Source-suffixed. (688) to (694) illustrate Source
complements with nominalizations of finite verbs:(688) jarrambu-yi-wunba          mayi-wunba           wud-janga-ndi             lurrbu

        'He'll have to spear another when he comes back from it/that, from having
        speared the kangaroo'.
  Occasional examples were recorded in which a finite verb form was Source suffixed,
and the case ending could have a fairly concrete sense. This was particularly true of the
Habitual category, which as observed in 8.10. often is used to establish background in
terms of the typical action or conditions, and in this sense is a more stative than active
category of the verb.(695)   ma-yi-0-jingi-n-ga-wunba                    ma-ngayi-nyanga-n

11.6. Ablative particle complements
As mentioned in 11.5., Ablative case suffixation of nominalized complements derived
from finite verbs is rare. In textual material, Source was found with such complements.
In elicitation, informants sometimes produced an Ablative-suffixed, nominalized
complement, but then almost invariably changed it to Source. However, as also noted,
both Source and Ablative case regularly occur with particles. An example of a sentence
made up by an informant to illustrate the use of Allative-marked gurrg-bi-warr
(/gurrg-ba-yi-warr/) was first given including an Ablative-marked complement using the
same verb:(698)   gurrg-bi-warr            nganja              yiwarna-warr           lagla-warr

        later I'll come home from having slept'.","[307, 308, 309]"
"
10.9. Variant ordering in DEM + N phrasesIn 10.3 it was said that the most common ordering of demonstrative and specified noun
is DEM + N. It was also noted that such phrases containing the forms of the Proximate
demonstrative nana are of particularly high frequency, since that category has the
function of signaling the textual recoverability of the entity, and is perhaps most
comparable to the English definite article (see 7.2. for illustration). But recoverability in
general does not completely coincide with the identification in context of which
particular recoverable entity is being referred to. Let us consider some instances of the
variant order with the Proximate category, N + DEM, since it would appear to be
associated with and one of the means of clarifying which recoverable or given noun
phrase within the information unit is meant, by signalling a break in the flow.
  In certain instances where two protagonists have been spoken about, the variant order
seems to be associated with a shift from one to the other.
  In the Onion text, line 65 we have an instance of marluga nana. Two men have been
discussing the illness of one of them who ate food prepared by two girls. The other man
suggests to him that he has been ensorcelled, and he agrees. ""I dreamt about them"" (63),
""about the two of them giving me onion, he says"" (64). At that point the other old man
calls out to the girls and tells them to rub the victim with fat. It is at that point in line
(65) that the phrase in question occurs, and appears to be associated with a transition
from the speaker quoting the victim, to the other old man asserting his authority over the
girls and telling them to cure him. Note that the ""other"" old man re-introduced at this
point is grammatically the subject of an intransitive verb (""call to"") which takes dative
complement.
  In the text Mejern, between lines (93) and (98) there is a similar shift in transition
between two recoverable characters. An old Aboriginal man identified as the father of
246 Chapter 10Micky Bennett was hiding along the river (92) and saw a white man shooting Aborigines
(93). For several dozen lines the speaker has been talking about shooting by whites, not
individually identifiable but only known as associated with local stations. A chief interest
of this part of the story is the identifiability of particular Aborigines and their exploits in
the face of European violence. Having seen the white (or whites) shooting (93), the old
Aboriginal man spears his horse out from under him (94-97), and he falls. Line (98)
begins with the variant order memden nana, perhaps associated with the transition from
the previous few lines in which the old Aboriginal man is the assumed agent (ellipsed in
97). A similar shift occurs between about lines (99) and (104). In (99), the old Aborigine
runs up to the white and stabs him, ""with a tommyhawk"" (100), ""stab"" (101), and runs
away up on top (of the hills) (102-103). Line 104 says: mernden nana gud gajurri 'the
white man stood up'. That is, both are recoverable as nana signals, but I hypothesize that
the variant order may be associated with the signalling of a shift among recoverable items,
specifically to one that has receded slightly into the narrative background.","[269, 270]"
"
10.11. Pronominal topicsIt is commonly said of non-Pama-Nyungan languages as well as some others which have
participant marking on the verb, that pronouns are mainly used ""emphatically"", for
example, contrastively (e.g., Merlan 1983; Heath 1984). This is true of Wardaman, where
topic pronominals of the absolutive independent series typically establish someone as of
especial pronominence in relation to a verb. The construction can be illustrated from text.
250 Chapter 10  In the Onion text, the speaker is setting the scene, and establishes in short order what
three people concerned with the action were doing:(603) ngayugu      nga-dagbarla-rri             anyin
      1SG-ABS      ISG-have-PST                [onion]-ABS
      Ί had the onion'.        dorij-ji      0-ginye-rri-ya                 lay in

        mine-ABS   YI-husband-ABS 3-3SG-come-PRES                       thatway-ABL
        'My HUSBAND is coming from that way'.
  In first position in each unit there seems to be a participant presented as a piece of new
and salient information. Notice that one might expect ngayugu in the first unit to be
ergative-marked, but it is not. This may be due to absolutive forms being the normal, or
""unmarked"" topic series for personal pronouns, and this may override the grammatical
function of 1SG in the particular instance.
  Other examples are drawn from the text Elsie, which exhibits numerous such first
person topics as might be expected in a narrative of personal biography.(604) yibujgun        im rekan

"5.2.2. Absolutive caseSome functions of Absolutive case have already been summarized: it is the case of the
intransitive subject and the direct object, and of both notional ""indirect"" and ""direct""
object nominals in ditransitive clauses. It is also the usual case-form of the notional agent
in clauses without identifiable, grammatical direct object, that is, in which any second
participant is not marked in the verb, but is in Dative (or other, oblique) case-form.
Absolutive is the usual ""citation"" form which informants use to mention the word for
something.
                                                    Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 69  A further illustration of Absolutive marking the intransitive subject function is:(24)   yibiyan      0-yanggi        durd   0-me-ndi-ya                            gamin
       man-ABS      3SG-goPST       grab   3SG-AUX-PST-NAR                        spear-ABS
       wiyan-wan             0-nyanga-ndi
       water-ABS-DF           3SG-come-PST
       'The man went and grabbed his spear as the water came ...'.
  Here ""man"" and ""water"" function as intransitive subjects, ""spear"" äs transitive object.
  Absolutive is also the nominal complement of the verb in certain predications:(25)   ngayal           0-bu-ndi               warlanin
       flower-ABS       3SG-AUX-PST           coolibah-ABS
       'The coolibah flowered'.(26)   yi-gulan            nge-we-n                  gila
       YI-ear-ABS          1 SG-fall-PRES             indeed
       'I've actually forgotten'.
  One of the ways of saying ""to forget"" is with verb we- (which otherwise means'to fall'),
and Absolutive-marked ""ear"", the complement. Similar to this are many predications
with nominal complement mejern 'stomach', e.g., mejern lud-ba jingi- ('stomach',
particle lud-ba, and AUX jingi-) 'to be happy, glad' (with possible Dative complement
""concerning which"").
  Absolutive is the case of the nominal subject of verbless predications:(27)   jewed-ba         yirrigu             madin
        share-PS        1EXNSG DAT          language-AB S
       'We all have the same language, we are ""company"" for language'.
  The predicative function seems to be filled by jewedba, and the 1EXNSG Dative
pronoun expresses those with respect to whom language is shared. An alternative
analysis might treat ""our language"" as constituents of a single phrase, with jewedba again
in predicative function.(28)   yi-meleman    bujun     yinyang            milygbilyg-ba      yini-jingi-n

       3SG-DAT      child-DAT
       'If you [SG] were black your heart would beat/be apprehensive for the child'
       [undergoing initiation].
 Here, ""black"" and 2SG independent pronoun are Absolutive in case form, ""black"" the
non-verbal predicator.
70 Chapters(29)   yilama            wurrugu            yi-man              yibiwan
       maybe             3NSGDAT            YI-good             man-ABS
        'Supposedly he was a good fellow to them'.
 The above is a verbless predication with Absolutive phrase ""good man''.
 Finally, the subject of the verb made reflexive or reciprocal is not Ergative-marked, but
Absolutive-marked:(30)   dang-guya          yarrula-wuya        dirlyag-ba             yawu-da-yi-n
       that-DU-ABS        young person-DU-ABS sweetheart             3NSG-AUX-RR-PRES

       YI-eye-ABS           3NSG-make-RR-PRES
        'That young couple are sweet on each other, they're making eyes at each other'.
  In (30), ""two young people"" is Absolutive-marked, in keeping with the fact that the
predicate dirlyag-ba na-yi- is (reflexive)-reciprocal. (The figure of ""making eyes at""
appears to be indigenous to Wardaman; in fact, yimum 'eye' is used to mean""sweetheart"",
so the last part of the example is to be understood something like, 'they are making
sweethearts of each other'.)5.2.3. Dative caseThe suffix -gu ~ -wu occurs in constructions both of genitive, and general oblique (dative
or purposive) types. There is, as noted, no marking on the verb for nominals or noun
phrases in either of these functions, unless (in the case of the genitive nominal or phrase)
it also fills a major syntactic function within the clause.
   The major formal means of placing an additional argument in construction with the
verb in Wardaman is by means of a Dative complement, expressing relations of the kind
""for, to, in respect to, concerning"". As illustrated above in (11 - 13), there are certain
verbs which demand ditransitive clausal construction, in which both major object types
are Absolutive-marked in the nominal, the notional indirect (human, animate) object the
one marked in the object pronominal slot on the verb. But there are verbs of very similar
meaning to these ditransitives, that determine clausal construction in which there is an
agent, and a complement, ""object of the action"", which goes into the Dative case.
Examples were given in (12 - 13). An additional Dative argument is often placed in
relation to both intransitive and transitive verbs. Examples are:(31)   ngarr-ya          jarrambu            wuja-wu
       1 INPL-go          looking            wood-DAT
       'Let's go looking for wood '.(32)   marranyin         me       nganu
       sugar-ABS        get       1 SG DAT
       'Get sugar for me' [marranyin = 'sand', 'sugar'].
                                                    Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 71(33)   bog-bame       wiyan                 wurre-wu           ya-0-ba-n-ga
       dip-PS AUX     getwater-ABS          child-DAT          3-3SG-bum-PRES-SUB
       marninggani-yi
       sun-INST
       'Dip some water for the child [who's] hot in the sun'.(34)   nginngin          ngan-da-rri                mayi-wu
       say no            3SG/1SG-AUX-PST            food-DAT
       'He refused me food' [said no to me about food].
  The most literal meaning of the verb particle nginngin seems to be 'to shake head no',
but ""refusal"" is also understood to be tantamount to being ""jealous concerning"", and
nginngin is often translated in this way in Kriol. The particle may enter into construction
with verb bu-, in which case both person refused and the thing concerning which refusal
is made, are typically Dative complements:(35)   nginngin         0-bu-ndi             nganu             mayi-wu
       say no           3SG-AUX-PST          1SGDAT            food-DAT
       'He refused me food' [said no to me about food].
  An overt nominal agent of nginngin bu- or na- could be Ergative-marked, but might
also be Absolutive (textual examples of both kinds exist). Similarly, many actions which
may be performed with respect to a complement require that it be Dative:(36)   wiyl             ya-0-yana          nganu
       whistle          3-3SG-AUX          1SGDAT
       'He's whistling at me'.(37)   lirrngang-ma      ya-0-yu           nganu         nga-we-ny-ga                 yum-ba
       laugh-PS          3-3SG-AUX         1SGDAT        ISG-fall-PST-SUB             tree-ABL
       galul-wa
       up-ABL
       'He's laughing at me having fallen down from the tree'.
  The usual form of construction in Wardaman is for Dative-marked nominal
complement to also be marked by independent Dative pronoun, and the latter in fact often
precedes the former in the clause. The nominal establishing identity of the Dative-
complement often occurs at some remove from the Dative pronoun, forming an
absolutely typical kind of loose linkage within the clause.(38)   menyje           go                 gawalya-wu

       lie in wait      3SG-AUX-PST            3SGDAT          kangaroo-DAT
        'He lay in wait for the kangaroo'.(41)   wonggo           yini-gaygba          (gunga)           wurre-wu

       'You shouldn't call out to/for the child'.
  Dative marks the complements of certain formally mediopassive verbs, the latter status
indicated by stem-formative -yi-, identical to the reflexive-reciprocal marker, but in these
verbs, not identifiable as such.(42)   nga-geng-mi-yi-n               lin-gu
       ISG-fear-MED-PRES             snake-DAT
       'I'm frightened of snakes' [or frightened of the snake].
  The above contrasts with predicate geng-ma- 'fear', which determines transitive clause
structure.(43)   nga-wali-yi-n                         nganinggin-gu              yi-marnany-gu
       ISG-jealous-MED-PRES                  mine GEN-DAT               YI-husband-DAT
       'I'm jealous of my husband'.
  While wali-yi-, as (43) shows, occurs with Dative complement expressing person
concerning whom one's jealousy is aroused, there is a contrasting verb wali-na- (with
inseparable auxiliary na-, otherwise 'to see') which occurs in transitive clauses with the
person causing one to be jealous (rather than the one with respect to whom one is jealous)
treated as direct object.
  Dative also marks the nominal complement in purposive clauses (see 11.4.).
  Possessive phrases in Wardaman have a typical structure in which the possessor if
nominal is Dative-marked, if pronominal is expressed by the appropriate independent
Genitive pronoun; and the possessor, whether nominal or pronominal, is also marked by
a form of the Dative independent pronoun agreeing with nominal or pronominal
possessor. Ordering of these constituents is not strict: the Dative-marked nominal, for
example, may occur before or after the agreeing Dative pronoun (see further 10.4.). A
considerable number of examples, culled from texts, illustrating mainly nominal but also
pronominal possessors, is given. These are fairly similar in content and are chosen to
show, among other things, various ordering possibilities.

  Note as in (51) the resumptive Dative pronoun (nganu) may be omitted from a clause
such as this, in which the possessive phrase functions as direct object.
  To express possession of a possessor, both possessors are Dative-marked (and there
may be independent Dative pronoun, especially agreeing with nominal possessor):

       'That old man, my father's father, came ...'.
  In (54), the narrator explains a relationship by genealogical steps for which, of course,
a separate term (gagung) exists.
  A Dative-marked nominal or pronominal possessor cannot be further inflected for
function within the clause; that is, the possessor noun cannot be inflected to show
agreement with the function of the possessed noun.(55)   nganinggin-gu              yi-guyu-wu            minini-yi       nga(n)-la-rri

       'My mother's dog bit me'.
  That is, the double possessor construction ""my mother's"" cannot be Ergative-marked
to agree with the possessed noun, ""dog"".
  Examples of possessive constructions which involve some other kinds of possessed
nominals (besides kin) are:(56)   wu-den           go            gumurrinji-wu           wudu           0-yanja
       WU-wing          3SGDAT        emu-DAT                 small-ABS      3SG-goPRES
       'The emu's wings are/have become small'.(57)   wonggo       0-yerde-rri              madin           memde-wu            gunga

       'He didn't know the white man's language at all, he shook his head'.
  It can now be seen that the expression of possession is rather similar to the typical
Dative complement, in that the favoured construction for both is one in which the nominal
complement/possessor occurs in construction with independent Dative pronoun (and
also, pronominal possessor may occur in construction with independent Dative pronoun).
As one further example, note the occurrence of gunga in the following:
                                                    Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 75

       Ί helped out [Kr. 'take partner la', as in fight] my aunt and also I helped out
       my mother'.
  In both clauses gunga comes before Dative-marked nominal.
  Given that possessive phrases and Dative complements both exhibit the favoured
structure with independent pronoun and Dative-marked nominal, it is sometimes difficult
to insist on a clear difference between structural descriptions of clauses as ones in which
the Dative pronoun is a complement (generally, semantic beneficiary) of the verb, versus
those in which it is part of the possessor phrase. Examples (59) and (60) illustrate the
structural overlap:(59)   nga-gard-bu-n              gunga               nguwun              wurre-wu

       'You [PL] make the old woman's bed for her' [you make a bed for the old
       woman].
  Finally, Dative is used to mark ""number of times"" with the numbers guyamin 'two' and
murrgun 'three': guyamin-gu 'twice', and murrgun-gu 'thrice'. There is no exactly
analogous form with the number lege One'. Instead, Once, one time' is often expressed
by the adverb dijbi, but there is also a form legegumin used in this meaning. (See 7.6.6.
for -min). A related form legegun is used to mean Once, once in a while, sporadically,
from time to time' (7.6.5.).","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"

                              a  For each stop, there is a corresponding nasal. There are five stop-nasal series (as in
neighbouring Mangarrayi, Merlan 1982; and Wardaman's congeners Yangman and
Dagoman, but unlike Wakiman to the north which, as noted in Chapter 1, has only four
points of articulation, and lacks the distinction between apico-alveolar and apico-domal
series, Cook 1987: 24).
  The orthography is convenient in that it requires no special diacritics. However, the
digraph ng representing the velar nasal needs to be distinguished from the sequence
apical nasal plus velar stop , as in the word /dongo/ 'in a line'. In order to eliminate this
ambiguity, that combination is written with full stop separating the two segments: don.go.
This is not done at morpheme boundary, however, where the presence of hyphen is
sufficient to indicate that two distinct segments of different morphemes are involved,
e.g., yibiwan-gu 'man, person' (Dative).
12 Chapter 2    Word-finally, the palatal digraphs are inverted (ly is written as yl, and ny as yn),
 because this seems to make it easier for those who already read English to approximate
 the correct pronunciation.
    In Wardaman, the bilabial series involves true bilabial occlusion.
    In the apico-alveolar series, the active articulator is the tip of the tongue making contact
 with the alveolar ridge. For the apico-domal or retroflex consonants, the active
 articulator is the apex making contact in the pre-palatal region. It can be difficult to
distinguish phonetically between members of the two apical series, especially
 intervocalically. Here, even what turn out, upon close investigation, to be plain apical
consonants, may occasionally have a hint of retroflex vocoid on-glide. Also, what turn
out to be retroflex segments are often realized with relatively little phonetic retroflexion,
and this appears to be true in any position. Thus the apical series, across their realizations,
tend to be more similar to each other than in some other languages of the region. Despite
the problems sometimes posed by identification of the difference between corresponding
members of the two series, and even despite a certain tendency towards harmonic
phonetic ""spread"" of retroflexion to other apical consonants in the word following a
retroflex one (perhaps similar to a phenomenon identified in Wakiman by Cook 1987:
26-29, see 3.7.3.), there can be no doubt of the phonological status of the distinction in
Wardaman.
   For the production of lamino-palatals, the tongue is laterally spread, with the tip of the
tongue touching the back of the lower teeth, the blade the alveo-palatal region. Lateral
spread of the tongue is particularly noticeable in the (rather rare) realizations of the
lamino-palatal lateral ly before peripheral stops and glides. All three laterals are voiced
bilateral approximants.
   The velar series is dorso-palatal.
   Of the two rhotics, the apico-alveolar /rr/ is a tap, never a trill. The glide Irl is a post-
alveolar approxirnant. There is no question of the phonemic distinctness or positional
neutralization of the rhotic contrast in Wardaman, Yangman, and Dagoman. But here
again a signal difference with Wakiman must be noted: there, the rhotic contrast
minimally distinguishes few forms, and the tap rhotic in that language has a variant which
is phonetically indistinguishable from the post-alveolar glide (Cook 1987: 29).
   /w/ is a voiced bilabial frictionless continuant, with rounding noticeable before /u/ and
Ιοί. However, before /u/ in the noun class prefix /wu/, there may be very little to no
noticeable lip-rounding or protrusion, such that the realization of this sequence is [u].
Likewise, the voiced vocoid /y/, normally produced with considerable lateral tongue
spread and approximation of blade and mid-tongue to palate, may exhibit a minimal
degree of these articulatory features word-initially before the high front III. This is
frequently the case in the realization of the higher animate noun class prefix /yi/, as [/'],
but much less so of pre-/i/ realizations elsewhere (e.g., in such words as yilgbayi 'all
right, enough'). The correct generalization seems to be that where the conditions are met
for higher and tenser realization of/i/, there may be minimal realization of the semivowel.
Where, however, (as in yilgbayi, with its closed first syllable), there is [/] realization of
the vowel, there tends to be fuller realization of the semivowel. And it is precisely in its
morpho-phonological occurrences as noun class prefix that the former conditions (for
                                                                        Segmental phonology 13
higher and tenser realization of the vowel, see below on vowel allophony) are most often
met. Since there is no other compelling evidence for a contrast between /yi/ and /i/
morpheme-initially, nor, indeed, any independent evidence for vowel-initial morphemes
(save one α-initial one) in the language, this can apparently be treated as a specialization
in the noun class morphemes.
  The vowel /i/ is realized as a high, front, maximally tense [/] in open syllables, and
particularly before the palatal segments /j/, /ny/, /ly/, both semivowels, and also the rhotic
/rr/, as in the following examples (in some, more than one condition is met):
      [ 'warrija ]      'alligator'
      [ 'lidi ]         'long-horned grasshopper'
      [li'warrga ]      'ground sugar bag'
      [ 'girrgilang ]   'galah'
      f 'ginyang ]      catfish species
      [ 'ginydan ]      'stone spear point'  In the last form above, the high and tense vowel quality is the main auditory cue
signalling the palatal articulation of the following nasal, which before the stop normally
evidences no palatal off-glide.
  The /i/ vowel is realized as slightly lower and less tense in closed syllables:
      [ 'munln ]        'rock cod'
      [ 'mardlrd ]      'whistling kite'
      [yllg'bayi]       OK, enough'   There are morphemes with phonetic long [/':], sometimes also realized as a diphthong
[if]. This appears to be best regarded as the sequence /iyi/, which can be shown to contrast
with /i/ in an otherwise very similar environment. The following two forms illustrate
this contrast between such a long vowel, and a fairly high, tense but short /i/:
      \ji:la}           'well'                   /jiyila/
      \jila ]           originative suffix       /jila/  There are other examples for which no minimally or sub-minimally distinct form can
be cited, e.g., [bi:marla], /biyimarla/ 'inflate'.
  There is a parallel to the above in the length of the vowel, and syllable reduction, in the
verb particle [du:], also realized as [duU] 'to raise' (with auxiliary bu-), in the noun [lu:n]
'cave', in the noun [ngu:n] 'faeces', in the particle [buUdba] 'cook under ashes', the
noun stem [muUdban] 'wet soil'. In all cases we must recognize the combination of
/uwu/ in accounting for the phonetic length of the vowel: /duwu/, /luwun/, /nguwun/,
/buwud-ba/, /mu-wudban/ (the latter apparently with nominal class marker showing fixed
assimilation to the first stem vowel).
  In contrast with the above V\ + homorganic glide + Vi sequences, combinations with
vowel and heterorganic glide, [iwi] and [uyu], tend to remain clearly syllabified, or may
be only slightly reduced ([yi-ngawuyu] 'wife', [miwinin] 'camp, sleep').
14 Chapter 2  /e/ is realized as a mid front unrounded, and fairly lax vowel [e] in closed syllables,
except before palatal segments, where it tends to be at its highest and tensest It may be
slightly higher and tenser in open syllables, including word-finally, but not cardinal [e]:     ['bedbog ]                   'honey eater'
     ['nienjen ]                  'cheeky'
     [ gej ]                      ' ask' (particle)
     ['nienyje]                   'to feel, hold, grasp'
     [ tiK'gernnan ]              Dioscorea sp.
     [ yinge 'we]                    might fall'
     [ jenibe ]                   ' death adder'  In almost all environments lot is realized as a mid to slightly lower rounded vowel [o].
It is slightly higher than mid in the environment of /w/, but is nowhere cardinal [o].     [mo'gorlgorl ]              Anipelocissus sp.
     [ 'nyob o ]                  ' marsupi al mouse'
     ['ngorrogorro ]              'afternoon'
     ['nsno'iiwrran ]            personal name
     ['nonggs ]                  'too, also' (cf. [nungguru ] 'hand')  The distinction between realizations of/o/ and/u/ can be difficult to identify, but clearly
bears a considerable functional load in lexical stems.
  The usual realization of /u/ is [U ], in closed syllables. It is slightly higher and tenser
in open syllables, including word-finally, and before palatal segments:     [wi'liwiiga ]                'stone curlew'
     ['bUlyan}                    'eagle'
     [nuirru 'jUnnian ]           ' sand frog'
     [ 'naribu ]                  ' freshwater mussel'  Under primary stress in open syllables, /a/ is realized as maximally open, [a.]; in other
open syllables it is regularly realized as slightly more centered [a], and this is
approximately its 'elsewhere' realization, except before apicals, where it is slightly
fronted, somewhere between [a] and [ce\.     \gu 'lirrida ]              ' peew ee'
     [ 'ga. läwärrä ]            ' plumed pigeon'
     [li'rra.wln ]               'black cockatoo'
     \ja'ntardba ]               'rainbow fish'
                                                                      Segmental phonology 15
2.2. Distributional restrictions: VowelsVowels do not occur morpheme-initially in Wardaman, except in the tag-question particle
ale (this is one of the few Wardaman words often produced with an audible, final glottal
constriction, indicative of the intensity of the tag question syntagm 'is that so?'). It was
noted above that the noun class prefixes /wu/ and /yi/, i.e., with homorganic semivowel
and vowel, are commonly realized as [u] and [/]. In other such word-initial combinations,
the glide tends to remain unreduced, or somewhat less so; and the semivowel is not
reduced in initial combination with non-homorganic vowel:
     [Vw/τεη]         'child'
     ['wUjbln]        'greedy'
     [yu'gUrni]       'more, again'
  However, there is some variation, and there are some words, like /wuja/ 'fire, wood',
which appear to be commonly realized in both ways. In that word, it is likely the /wu/
is etymologically the noun class prefix, synchronically however to be analyzed as part
of the root. Leaving aside the matter of the noun class prefixes, and other instances of
word-initial /wu/ and /yi/ which may vary somewhat in degree of realization of the
semivowel, there is, as noted in 2.1., no cause to recognize vowel-initial morphemes in
Wardaman. The difference between morpheme-initial glide plus homorganic vowel, and
vowel alone, is environmentally limited (i.e., most common in the nominal class
markers), and never minimally distinctive. The absence or infrequency of vowel-initial
morphemes is also characteristic of a number of neighbouring languages, including
Mangarrayi, Yangman, and Jawoyn. Slightly further east, we find a very limited range
of α-initial morphemes in Alawa (Sharpe 1972) and Ngalakan (Merlan 1983: 11). In
Wardaman, there are a few inflectional morphemes that have the shape C (e.g., present
tense suffix -n, but none consists only of V, or has initial V.
  As noted in 1.3., the mid-vowels do not occur in any of the inflectional morphology,
which exhibits a three-vowel system, a, i, and u. There is, however, no lack of surface
mid-vowels in inflectional morphs, due to phonetic processes of assimilation (3.7.3.).
Among derivational morphemes and lexical suffixes, too, the mid-vowels are rare, but
there are instances, such as adverbial /beng/, expressing location or place where. The
mid-vowels are widely distributed over lexemes, and there is no particular evidence of
""defective"" distribution with respect to any word class. Though /a/, /i/ and /u/ are more
common finally than the mid-vowels, there are nonetheless quite a number of examples
of Id and /o/ finally, e.g.,: bone 'across'; ngajamberle, proper name; lowe, toponym;
bogo 'lend', jewele 'close, near', wume 'sky', modborrongo, proper name; and
inflectional forms of quite a number of verbs.
  Examples of minimal and sub-minimal vowel contrasts are:
     jin(ma)          'blame'
     jen(ma)          'cut into pieces'
     juny(ma)         'set' (of sun, celestial body)
     jongma-          'to kiss'
     jangma-          'to defecate'
16 Chapter 2
  There are no vowel clusters.
  See 3.7.3. for further remarks on distribution of the mid-vowels.","[35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]"

298 Chapter 1212.2.4. Yilama 'maybe, it might be that'The particle yilama expresses a moderate degree of uncertainty concerning a predication,
or sometime s concerning a nominal as the correct identification of an argument in relation
to a predication. This particle is not limited in its possible occurrences with tense-aspect-
mood forms of the verb; it seemingly may occur with all of them, though of course it is
much less likely to occur where the ""basic"" predicate form by itself expresses uncertainty
or hypotheticality, as does the future-admonitive. We saw above in discussion of gala
that the ordinary future does not express uncertainty in this sense, and in accordance with
that we find that yilama may freely subcategorize its modality.
  The uncertainty expressed by yilama is understood to be attributable to the speaker
whenever the subject of a predication is first person or includes a first person, i.e.,
whenever the speaker and grammatical subject coincide or partly overlap. Because of
this, yilama in such contexts is often best translated as Ί think', Ί suppose' or the like,
making clear the locus of uncertainty. When the grammatical subject is other than first
person, i.e., there is not coincidence of speaker and subject, the uncertainty expressed by
yilama is still clearly authored by the speaker, but is not understood to be as clearly
attributable to him or her, but seems rather to be understood as a degree of uncertainty
concerning the prepositional content of the clause itself, best glossed as ""maybe,
perhaps"" or the like.
  As described in 7.5.7., yilama (which formally appears to contain a morph identifiable
with the particle suffix, -ma, but inseparable here) commonly occurs with the indefinite
suffix -gan. This was described as differing from -warda in ""intensity"" of query (cf.
7.5.8.), the latter being more externally directed and a stronger elicitation of response.
-gan thus is often to be understood as expressing self-interrogation, with approximately
the force of a ""whatchamacallit"" kind of expression. The frequency with which -gan is
suffixed to yilama is in keeping with the extent to which the uncertainty expressed by
yilama is attributable to the speaker, whether or not this role coincides with that of
grammatical subject person. Examples of yilama (see also 715,728,732,733,734,735)
above are:(736)   nga-jaba-rri   wujaban       darni          nganinggin       yilama

  The story concerns a policeman who was speared by Aborigines on Willeroo Station
for having taken away from their husbands a number of Aboriginal women. The man
was speared and then stoned to death. It is not clear, in the second line, that there would
be any great difference between the passage as it actually occurred, above, and the other
kind of frequently realized possibility of -wan suffixed to the finite verb, and thus
positioned between clause-level units: gayardung wu-lawu-rri-wan deyn we-ny-ga. The
chief effect of -wan here is to signal a link between the episode of spearing, and the
running to catch up to, the victim. The second instance of -wan is also suffixed to the
first word in the tone group, in this instance a finite verb. From this same narrative, further
examples of -wan are in this sequence:(812) bangbun         dang-ganung       wunggunburr-ga-ndi         gunya       lurrbu

318 Chapter 12  An example of -wan suffixed to (normally) interjectional and/or resumptive ngawun
'no, nothing' (see 12.5.4.) is the following:(813)   wirrig-bi     0-na-rri       wurrugu     ngawun

  The text tells of a station worker who threatened Aborigines and shot up their camp.
He did this at night, and returned in the morning evidently to harrass them further. But
they had all gone uphill and out of reach. The cohesive effect of ngawun-wan here is to
link with the preceding description of an abandoned camp. Here again, -wan appears to
be a very broad and basic textual linking device.
  The following textual selection exemplifies the possibility of a bit of apparently
unrecoverable information being suffixed with -wan in a way that signals cohesion with
preceding text, and thus has the overall effect of de- emphasizing its newness.(814)   jarrug          nga-ngu-ndi-ya        worroman

        I filled my stomach'.  -wan is suffixed to ""honey"", signalling linkage with other kinds of things eaten, despite
the fact that this is the first mention of ""honey"".
                                               Clausal particles, conjunctions and interjections 319  A final example is of -wan suffixed to negative particle wonggo:(815) marluga     nana            mugum         0-jingi-ndi    gunga

        the old man started up now'.
  Here too a cleft translation may render the sense of cohesive linkage: ""and it wasn't
that he mistook/missed his forehead, only his hair here, he cut it"".
  The considerable tendency for -wan to occur suffixed to the first word in the tone group
is a strong indication of its generalized cohesive function, which as (815) suggests,
extends well beyond that word itself, sometimes effecting a linkage between entire tone
groups.","[339, 340, 341, 342, 343]"

8.11. Reflexive-reciprocalThe reflexive-reciprocal suffix, which immediately follows the bare stem and thus always
occurs following a vowel, is -vi-. If the final stem-vowel is a, presence of the reflexive-
reciprocal marker results in the assimilation of that vowel to i. Thus, the reflexive-
reciprocal stem of the transitive verb luma- 'cut' is lumi-yi-, while that of warrang-ma-
'to swear at', is \varrang-mi-yi-:
190 Chapter 8(436)   yawurr-warrang-mi-yi-n
        3-3NSG-swear at-RR-PRES
        'They're cursing each other'.
  The reflexive-reciprocal is used to express action where subject and object are identical,
including action upon oneself, and in this is similar to certain uses of the English
reflexive-reciprocal category. However, typically action of certain (largely negatively
evaluated?) kinds, such as fighting and swearing, are formulated with use of an ordinary
predicate made reflexive-reciprocal. Thus, for example, the typical way of saying that
people are fighting is to say, ya-wurr-bu-yi-n, literally 'they are hitting each other'. A
further example of this kind is the formally reflexive-reciprocal verb nge-yi- 'argue',
from transitive nge- 'call'. It seems that the meanings of these verbs should not be taken
too literally (e.g., as ""hit each other"", ""call each other""), but should rather be seen as a
kind of grammatical metaphor, or a typical way of formulating certain kinds of action.
The sentence ngamanda-wunya ya-wurr-nge-yi-n is approximately the equivalent of
English ""What are they arguing about?"", rather than the more literal ""What are they
calling each other (for)?"" A few textual examples of the reflexive-reciprocal category
follow:(437)   ngabulu-wan                 0-ginye-yi-rri              gunga
        breast-ABS-DF               3SG-cook-RR-PST             3SG-DAT
        'And she cooked her breasts for him ...'
  (437) refers to the customary practice of warming one's breasts in the heat of a fire in
order to begin and enhance milk-flow. Note that there is an independent Absolutive
nominal object in a part- whole relation to the subject of the predicate.(438)   ngabulu          jHyjiyl               0-me-yi-rri                jabalawarna-ya
        breast-ABS        squeeze              3SG-AUX-RR-PST        flat    rock-LOC
        'She expressed her milk onto the flat rock'.
  Here again, the ""breast"" which is part of the whole pronominal adjunct is treated as
Absolutive object, with reflexive-reciprocal expression of the action-on-self in the
predicate.(439)   wurr-ngu-ndi-wuya           girdibun    nan-ba-wan      wurr-bu-yi-rri-wuya
        3NSG-eat-PST-DU             finish      that-ABL-DF     3NSG-hit-RR-PST-DU
        'The two of them ate it all up and then they fought'.
  Following reflexive-reciprocal marking, Future tense-marking always has the shape
-ngbe; or, differently stated, the reflexive-reciprocal and Future together have the shape
-yi-ngbe:(440)   ya-wurr-bu-yingbe
        3-3NSG-hit-RR PUT
        'They are going to fight' .
                                                                Categories of the finite verb 191
  Reflexive-reciprocal forms of the verbs na- 'see' and bu- 'hit' have an important role
as auxiliaries in inchoative constructions; see 8.18.","[213, 214, 215]"
"
1.4. Territory and neighbours
Wardaman people whom I have consulted (see Merlan 1989b, c) identify the larger
Wardaman territory as a rough trapezoid with Scott Creek (Aboriginal name,
Wugimadgun) as an approximate northern boundary, the junction of Scott Creek and the
 Katherine River (Mululeyn) as the north-western extent,2 Romula Knob as an
approximate south-easterly extent, the road crossing of the Victoria River (Langgay) a
south-westerly one, and the rough country rising to the Dry River plateau an approximate
eastern side (see Map 1). Within this larger area they identify a number of Wardaman
territorial ""estates"". Eleven of these appear to be recognized as within the larger
Wardaman country. Yangman country lies to the east and north, on the Dry River and
running back north along major waterways to present Mataranka. The area north of the
junction of Scott Creek and the Katherine River, east to the King River, and north towards
the Ferguson River and Pine Creek, is identified by Katherine Aborigines as Dagoman
tribal territory. The northerly extent of Dagoman country is now difficult to establish,
such has been the disruption of European pastoral and later settlement (see e.g., Powell
 1988:98 on the early founding of Springvale Station 1876-1879 on the Katherine River
near the present town site, also Maff n.d.), and the accompanying diminution of numbers
and the salience of ""Dagoman"" as a socio-territorial identity. Though older Wardaman,
at least, clearly recognize that Manbulloo Station (just outside Katherine to the south-
west) is in Dagoman country, such has been their length of association with the area and
with other Aborigines living there, that they have a strong sense of attachment to it.
   Despite the linguistic closeness of Wardaman and Yangman, it would seem that in the
post-contact period, most Yangman had more to do with the Mangarrayi in the vicinity
of Elsey Station, than with the Wardaman. The Wardaman apparently associated more
than the Yangman in post-European times with Victoria River peoples, who came north
and worked on Delamere, Willeroo and Manbulloo Stations. Except for a small number
of Wardaman who worked at Victoria River Downs and southern stations, these three
properties have had a crucial role in the particular contact history of the Wardaman.
  Willeroo had been taken up early as a pastoral property, but the homestead was
temporarily abandoned when the first manager, Scott, was killed by Aborigines (Maff
n.d., p. 20). Soon after the lease was bought by TomPearce (see Spencer 1914), formerly
a publican in Katherine, and the station was developed as a cattle property. This was in
2. According to Ngamunugarri and Elsie Raymond, there is a second site of the same name on
   Mathison Creek, i.e. two sites are similarly named as what they regard as approximate western
   and eastern extents of Wardaman country.
8 Chapter 1a period of considerable development of stations to the south and west: Wave Hill and
Victoria River Downs. Delamere had been taken up early (1893) by a developer, Browne,
who also owned the Springvale lease near Katherine (the latter was passed in after failure
to successfully establish stock and particularly sheep there, in 1896). With the growth
of a cattle station at Manbulloo, and its purchase together with Willeroo and Delamere
by Vesteys Northern Properties, the stage was set for these three properties to be a
constellation among which Wardaman were shifted around by management, depending
on season and the work to be done. So it happens that many Wardaman today have great
familiarity with Willeroo and Manbulloo. Many people, especially older ones, also spent
periods of time at Delamere. Most Wardaman men until recently grew up learning to
work cattle, and most women grew up doing domestic work for the station and living in
the Aboriginal camps associated with all of these properties.
  The early period of initial ""contact"" with Europeans, here as in the Victoria River
District generally, had been one of considerable violence. An atmosphere had been
created, and persisted, in which the Aborigines could not be at all confident of the
benevolence of Europeans. For their part, the European station personnel seem to have
been mainly concerned with the Aborigines as workers (and to some extent, with the
women as sexual partners). They made little attempt to create comfortable conditions in
the Aboriginal camps — indeed, living conditions in the camp at Willeroo were very
poor through the 1970s, the last period during which Aborigines lived there in numbers
and for extended periods. While there, Aborigines were dependent on European transport
to town.
  Overall, the Wardaman at Willeroo, and possibly also at Delamere, seem to have been
living to a great extent on their own social resources, though they were dependent upon
the stations for subsistence. There appears to have been close and intense camp life at
the station, and considerable walk-about over the station during periods of stand-down
from work. Both forms of life were characterized by persistent use of the Wardaman
language. Those who came in to work, and/or married in, from elsewhere, tended to be
from Victoria River or other neighbouring peoples (such as Mudbura), and either spoke,
or learned to speak, Wardaman.
  These seem to have been the conditions which at least partly account for the persistence
of active speakership by older people, and the rather full knowledge on the part of some
younger people, of Wardaman today. Though the effects of the town context in which
most now live are not entirely clear, it seems very likely that, overall, life between the
camps and town does not offer the same sustained intensity and kinds of interaction with
a manageable number of well-known others, which seems to have been significant in
language retention throughout the station period.
  Most Wardaman now live in and around Katherine. A few men continue to do seasonal
stockwork, mostly in the Victoria River District, but also in the Roper River region. Some
families continue to attend religious ceremony, again mainly in the Victoria River area;
but there has also been some effort on the part of town-dwelling Wardaman to conduct
young men's initiations near Katherine town, and thus to establish it as a ceremonial
destination for the countrymen of the Victoria River region, and other parts of the
Katherine hinterland.
                                                                                    Introduction 9
1.5. Research on the language, fieldwork and informantsThere is only a small amount of published linguistic material on Wardaman. There are
also some earlier, unpublished sources.
  Gerhard Laves (MS) worked with Wardaman speakers in Darwin, and the resulting
material is now lodged in a larger file of his field notes at the Australian Institute of
Aboriginal Studies, Canberra (now the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Studies)3.
  Capell (1962) published a paradigm of the Wardaman transitive prefix combinations
as part of his work on ""pronominalization"" in Australian languages. A very large number
of the prefix forms given by Capell are inaccurate. Though it is pointless to run through
a catalogue of discrepancies here, an important thing to note is that in some of Capell's
forms, what I shall call the ""accusative"" marker -n- is inaccurately reported For
example, he cites the transitive combination 2SG/3SG as>yin-. It should actually beyi-,
with quite different implications for the structure of the system than if the first form were
correct.
  Before I began field work in 1976, Kenneth Hale made available to me some pages of
field notes he recorded in 1959 in the Alice Springs area, where he worked with an
informant who had some knowledge of Wardaman. This preliminary information was
very useful, and I am grateful for his generosity in making it available to me.
  I initially did fieldwork on Wardaman in 1976, from March to November, and for
periods in 1978. Fieldwork was conducted mainly in Katherine town around the fringe
camps, for though there were still some Wardaman people living at Willeroo in 1976,
station management was hostile to my living there or even visiting at the station camp.
I worked with some Wardaman people living in what were then called the ""New Homes"",
the first housing within the town itself to be explicitly made available to Aboriginal
families (from 1970). In particular, I came regularly to the New Homes to work with
Elsie Raymond (Nonomarran), who overall has been a principal informant for my
research, and some of her relatives, including her own mother Maggie Sing
(Birriwalngali, who has since passed away), Maggie's husband Tarpot Ngamunugarri,
Elsie's close ""second"" mother Ruby Allison (Gomnyang) who passed away in 1991, and
the latter's husband, also deceased. Other main informants during this early period were
two old men, both of whom have since passed away, who variously lived at Manbulloo
Station and at the ""High Level"" town camp on the northern fringe of Katherine. These
were Jabiru (Luwungmirr), and Old Gregory (Darlunggag). Neither man considered
himself ""full"" Wardaman, but both were fluent speakers of the language. Especially the
latter was considered by Wardaman people to have rich knowledge of matters relating to
country, mythology, and contact history. He was probably born around 1906, and spent
a large part of his working life at Manbulloo Station, apparently carrying over from
Dagoman people there information concerning their early contact history in the
immediate Katherine area which is no longer widely known. In this initial period I also
did research on other Aboriginal languages of the Katherine area.
3. I am grateful to David Nash for having brought the Laves material to my attention and supplied
photocopies of the Wardaman sheets.
10 Chapter 1  During 1977 I mainly worked around Mataranka and at the Aboriginal community on
Elsey Station, which was then called Djembere (now Jilkminggan, /jilgmirn.gan/),
collecting material on both Yangman and Mangarrayi (Merlan 1982). By early 1977 I
had written a preliminary draft of a Wardaman grammar, with appended 57 pages of
text. This remained unpublished, however, lodged in the library at the Australian Institute
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra.
  It was not until 1988 and 1989 that I did some further intensive work on Wardaman, in
short periods each year. One of the principal results of this work was the addition of a
considerable amount of text material, concentrating on the mythology of sites on Willeroo
Station (that we were then able to visit owing to a change in station management), on
people's accounts of their lives and experiences, and oral history of the early pastoral
period. I was also able to do systematic checking of compiled grammatical and lexical
material.
  From 1988 I have also done more work with certain Wardaman people I knew from
the earlier period, but with whom I had not previously worked, or with whom I had only
worked occasionally. In the latter category are Lily Gin.gina and her mother Daisy
Gimiyn, on whom I relied increasingly for text material and some lexical checking. In
the former category is Claude Manbulloo (Yirdirdiman), who previously was absent from
Katherine for long periods on station work. In the last couple of years he has supplied
interesting material, textual and other, particularly on the area of Wardaman country to
which he is patrifilated, around Willeroo homestead. Over the years I got assistance in
language elicitation and in much else from his aunt, Nayda (Waramburr), who passed
away in 1991.
  I owe a particular debt to Elsie Raymond. Among the Wardaman, she has always been
the most prolific story-teller and recounter of history, genealogy, mythology, and all sorts
of information relating to past and present, that I have worked with. From her I have
gathered my most extensive textual material, and from her also I have constantly gotten
new lexical information as she has thought about our language work and made mental
notes of new things to tell me. She has also always encouraged her other relatives to help
with certain aspects of the work: in particular, she always enlisted both her mothers and
her father to help me with 'stories' and information of all sorts. Though her personality
and mentality are quicksilver, and therefore I think at times she has found it trying to
persist through elicitation and checking of grammatical forms, she has done so,
sometimes for hours on end, and sat with me to encourage others to do so. Over the last
couple of years I have gotten much help from her eldest son Oliver Raymond in text
transcription, and increasingly also, I was assisted in transcription by her second mother
Ruby Allison, and also Philomena (Ngelgerrej), Ruby's mother's brother's daughter and
Elsie's uncle's mother's brother's daughter.
  At various times in the early 1980s, Bill Harney (Yidumduma) made time and special
effort to help me locate sites on Manbulloo Station. He has been helpful in many ways
in the recent periods of my work as well.
  This description is written in gratitude for the help I have gotten from all these people,
and is for them and their families.

                              Segmental phonology
2.1. Phonemes and their realizationA practical orthography is used throughout this description. So far as I know, Wardaman
has not been written and no other practical spelling system has ever been devised for it.
 The phonemes of Wardaman are displayed in Table 1.","[31, 32, 33, 34, 35]"
"
4. For purposes of the count, the particle suffix was not considered to form part of any stem, but
   derivational, stem-forming affixes (such as noun-forming -ban ~ -man) were considered part
   of stems, and inseparable verbal auxiliaries were considered part of verb stems. Forms derived
   from a counted base form, whatever their structure, were not separately counted. The
   implications of the above are as follows: a verb particle such as nyerreng-ma 'make noise' was
   tallied as an all e stem. Derived forms such as nyerreng-ma-wujban 'noisy person' were not
   included in the count. Different bases for a count could validly be used, but the count as given
   at least affords some idea of relative vowel frequencies, and of the rather high incidence of forms
   which contain only one mid-vowel or the other.
46 Chapters3.8. ReduplicationThere is a considerable amount of non-productive or frozen lexical reduplication in
Wardaman, i.e., there are many words the basic form of which is reduplicative. These
include, for example, such particles as gijigijig 'tickle', mamajmamaj 'wave (to)',
dangdangma 'click', wujugwujug 'shake' (as tree, to dislodge animal or fruit), jibjib(a)
'itch', bornborn 'bathe', gajigaji 'walk, travel on foot', burrngburrng-ma 'boil', and so
on. Numerous examples could be cited among nouns. We will not consider such forms
here, but turn to productive processes of reduplication.
  First, however, it may be mentioned here that word- and even phrase-level repetition
is a common means for indicating repetitive, intensive, or distributive activity. Consider
the following examples:
       jarrug yirr-me-ndi               jamam jamam            yi-bumbu-gari
       egg        lEXNSG-get-PST        full  full             YI-billy-other-ABS
       yi-bumbu-gari
        YI-bill-other-ABS
        'We gathered eggs, full, full, another billycan, another billycan ...'.
  Here, in order to convey the impression of durative and repetitive activity and outcome,
the speaker repeats both ""full"" and the phrase ""another billy"".
  Other examples of word-level repetition are:
       wurren         yi-jad     yi-jad,          yi-jarlu         wudu     wudu
       child-ABS      YI-big     YI-big-ABS       YI-some-ABS      small    small-ABS
       'some big big children, some little little ones ...'.       lege-ya          yum-nya             0-jingi-ndi        walig       walig
       one-LOC          tree-LOC            3SG-sit-PST        around      around
       'It was (there) all around a single tree ...'.
  Here to give the impression of multiplicity, the speaker repeats the locational 'around'.
Another common way of indicating iteration, duration, repetition as a feature of text is
by over-long articulation of the final vowel of a verb form on a single pitch level:
wurr-wemiyi-rri::: yilgbayi 'they kept on vomiting, (then they were) OK'. There also
exists an iterative suffix (see 8.13.).
  Here, we will not further consider word-level repetition or higher text-level
construction of iteration and related meanings, except to note that it is not possible to
make an entirely clear-cut distinction between word-level repetition, and what might
otherwise be seen as complete reduplication within the word. The difficulty of
distinguishing these two applies particularly to verb particles.
  Several kinds of reduplication are found with verb particles. There are many particles
for which complete reduplication is common, warlbag 'to remove, take off, unsaddle'
etc. is commonly reduplicated as warlbagwarlbag; dijong-ma 'play the didgeridoo' as
dijongdijong-ma (but also dijorrong-ma), ngurluguy(-ma) 'mumble' as ngurluguy
ngurluguy(-ma), mambang 'chase' as mambangmambang, barlb 'put down, in' as
                                                                         Process phonology 47barlbarlb (with degemination), duwu 'swell, grow' as duwuduwu, and so on. It is
possible to identify a complete reduplicative form as within the word, rather than word
repetition, where the particle-final suffix is commonly used with the particle, and also
appears in its reduplicative form (as with dijongdijong-ma, or barlbarlb-a 'put down,
in'). However, certain particles (like mambang) tend not to occur with particle-final
suffix, and their usual reduplicative forms do not either.
  Partial reduplications are also common in verb particles as well as other parts of speech.
There appears to be no canon of phonological shape on the basis of which one may strictly
predict which words will reduplicate fully, and which partially, but there are indications
of some possible conditioning factors.
  Certain words reduplicate partially, i.e., the first two syllables or CVC(C)V-, where
complete reduplication would result in otherwise rare consonant clusters (see 2.4.). Thus
the reduplicative form oflabang 'put on one's shoulders' is laba-rlabang, never complete
*labang-labang. (Note the cluster ng-l occurs rarely, and only across morpheme
boundary). And although reduplication of any type operates only upon words of two or
more syllables, those of more than two syllables tend to exhibit partial rather than
complete reduplication. Thus, the usual reduplication of the verb particle gayardung 'run'
is gaya-gayardung; that of adjectival nominal jaburrunggun 'antecedents,
predecessors', jajaburrunggun; that of yiguwarlangana 'single', yiguguwarlangana
(also yiguwarlangana-mulu).
  Several important minor and major reduplicative patterns need to be mentioned. There
are two high-frequency noun stems which consist entirely of open syllables: marluga
Old man' and mulurru Old woman'. These have very high-frequency reduplicative
forms marlarluga and mululurru. Only the first stem, which contains vowels of different
quality, provides insight into the process:
In other words, the reduplicative segment is ma-RLA-rlu-ga, a combination of €2 and the
preceding V^ So common is this pattern that only two instances have been found in a
search of extensive text material of the alternatively possible marluga-mulu Old men'
with plural suffix: the reduplicated form is more common by far. And although a few
instances of mulurru-mulu have been found, this is by far less common than mululurru,
even when the noun is case-suffixed (as in mululurru-yi, ERG). Another example of this
pattern is the reduplicative form ofwardirrg 'young girl', wardardirrg 'young girls'.
  That not all reduplications follow the above pattern (with reduplicative segment
composed of €2 and Vj) is shown by the common reduplicative form of jumba 'behind,
in back' : jumbamba. Here, the reduplicative segment is jum-iam-ba, or a combination
of CB and V2C2. This may be associated with words with first, closed syllable. Another
example of slightly variant kind is the reduplicative, functionally adverbial yondondorr
'along, on the road', derived from the noun yondorrin 'road'. Here, the reduplicative
segment is evidently d plus ViC 2 . Another form of this kind is walbalbamda On/along
a plain, flat place' from walbarndan 'plain'. Also from barrwa 'down', reduplicative
barrwarrwa should be considered of this kind.
48 Chapter3  Another minor pattern is attested in a few roots which have first two syllables of the
shape S VjR/LVj, that is, with initial stop (often b) followed by a sequence of two identical
vowels separated by rhotic or lateral. In such instances the reduplicative segment is of
the shape wUR/LM, as in the examples:

                                                                      YI-class

     marranyin                   marrawarrayn                      'sand'   The last reduplicative form, marrawarrayn, is used to describe plants and animals
 which ""belong to"", that is are indigenous to, sand country, such as various plum types,
 and so oa
   A few other forms have been found to have a similar but not identical internal segment.
 For example, there was noted above a form related to the particle dijong-nra 'play
 didgeridoo', dijorrong-nia.
   The most important of minor patterns is one in which the reduplicative segment (from
 which the copy is made) is bounded off from the reduplicated segment byg. This pattern
was found to occur with stems of the major word classes: nominal, verbal, and particle.
There are a number of unusual features and different possibilities in this process.
   There are some difficulties stating the domain or conditions of application of this kind
 of reduplication; some different attested types must at least be distinguished Where a
lexical stem is only bisyllabic, it often constitutes the input to reduplication. One case
is that otjiurndu 'short' (commonly ""short piece of cloth or material""), theg-form of
which is jurndug-jurndu. The high-frequency g-form of the verb burla- 'to lie to,
deceive' is burlag-burla; of durla- 'copulate with', ditrlag-durla; and so on. In a few
common instances where a lexical stem is monosyllabic, the reduplicating unit may
include a nominal class prefix as part of it. Reduplicating forms of the monosyllabic
adjectival nominal jad 'big' consist only of nominal class marker plus stem, ma-jad,
yi-jad etc. In this instance, the reduplicating unit is shown to be such bisyllabic
combinations of class marker plus stem: yijagyijad, tiiajagniajad, etc.
   Note that where such a bisyllabic unit has a final consonant, that segment does not
constitute part of the reduplicating unit but is zeroed The zeroing of stem-final d in
g-forms of ""big"", above, illustrates this. Another example is theg-form of the noun stem
yibarnang 'aunt': barnag-barnang. The occurring form shows that the stem-final nasal
is dropped
   Further evidence below will show that the reduplicative process does not always apply
to bisyllables in the way described; there is an alternative pattern.
  Where a stem is more than bisyllabic, examples show that either the final two syllables,
or penultimate and antepenultimate syllables may occur as the reduplicating unit. In the
first instance, the commong-form of the verb dagbarla- 'have' is dagbarlag-barla-. In
                                                                          Process phonology 49the second instance, the high-frequency g-form of the verb particle barlarra 'hide' is
barlag-barlarra. If the verb ""have"" were to reduplicate according to the second pattern,
it would yield dagbag-barla-. This sounded unusual to informants, and it never occurred
in text, while the form dagbarlag-barla- was found several times. The closed first
syllable of the root may be a factor in determining that the reduplicating segment is the
final CVCV, while there is no such limiting factor in the case of barlarra.
    There are both bisyllabic and trisyllabic stems in which the reduplicating segment
consists only of one CV unit plus g. There is no obvious structural explanation why these
reduplicate in this way, rather than as described above. For example, the bisyllable
warling 'initiand, charge' has g-form wagwarling. The reduplicating unit is the CV
syllable -wa- only, plus g. If this bisyllable (which shows no unusual stress pattern or
other obvious feature) were to reduplicate as above, it would yield warlig-warling.
Exemplifying the same pattern for a trisyllabic stem is yuwarrin 'poor fellow', with
g-form yuwagwarrin. Here again, the the penultimate CV syllable by itself constitutes
the reduplicating segment. Another noteworthy case of this sort is the g-form of
wilyangun 'boy, lad': wilyagjangun. Were this form to be entirely regular, this would be
wilyaglyangun. However, the palatal lateral, post-stop, is substituted by the
corresponding stop (see also some tabled forms below of e.g., g-form of me- 'to get', na-
'see').
   Let us now turn to a number of common nominal stems which happen to designate
personal statuses, and all have the shape CVCVCV(C), e.g., yingurla 'lad, single boy'.
In these, there appears a reduplicated CV syllable, that is of shape gV, to the right of the
base form's penultimate syllable: yingugurla. As the example shows, the V of the gV
syllable is that of the base form's penultimate syllable. Other examples of this kind are
listed below. What seems unusual here is that the reduplicated segment apparently is to
the right of the reduplicating unit, or segment, its source. In other examples we have
seen above it seems to be to the left. However, for reasons that will become clearer when
g- reduplication in certain high-frequency monosyllabic verb stems is considered, these
cases should not be regarded as anomalous in this way. Rather, the reduplication should
be seen as involving reduplication of the penultimate CV, plus g, yielding an hypothetical
intermediate form: yingugngurla. The cluster gng is simplified by zeroing of the nasal:
yingugurla. (The cluster gng is rare, and occurs only in reduplicative forms.) The analogy
with certain «-initial monosyllabic verb stems will be shown below. From that discussion,
it will become clear that the crucial feature of all the CVCVCV(C) examples is not their
syllabic structure per se, but the presence of (medial) ng.
   Wardaman's high-frequency CV verb stems also have g-reduplicative forms (see listing
below). The process is simple, involving here reduplication of the CV, plus g, the unit
occurring leftwards of its source. To illustrate with an inflected verb form and its
g-counterpart, we have: yawurr-bun 'they hit it', and yawurr-bugbun.
   It is apparent that such reduplication must be seen as operating upon already inflected,
or inflectionally specified, forms. This can be seen from the fact that basic /j-initial stems
have g-forms which show appropriate stopping of that nasal following nonsingular rr
(3.5.1.). For example, for the verb ni- 'to bring', the 3NSG form 'they bring it' is
yawu~din, the g-form yawu-digdin.
50 Chapters  For the verb na- 'to see', the corresponding singular and plural, regular and g-forms,
are as follows:
      'he sees it'    ya-nan        g-form      ya-nagdan
      'they see it'   yawn-dan      g-form      yawu-dagdan
  We might expect the 3SG g-form ya-nagdan to be *ya-nagnan. However, as we saw
above, a similar kind of process was found in the stopping of palatal lateral after g in
wilyagjangun 'lads'. We may generalize that post-g appears to be a stopping environment
for both apical nasals, and laterals. We also find the g-form of me- 'get', megbe-, rather
than *megme-. (It happens that there is a distinct bisyllabic root megbe- 'break, snap',
with which the g-form of me- is thus homophonous.)
  Finally, let us look at examples of CV verb stems which parallel the features of g-
reduplication in CVCVCV(C) nominal stems discussed above. There are two high-
frequency CV stems that being with ng, ngu- 'to eat', and nge- 'to sing1. These have g-
forms as follows (examples are 3NSG, but this is not significant here): yawurr-ngugun,
and yawurr-ngegen. We expect, by analogy with the majority of other examples above,
yawurr-ngugngun and yawurr-ngegngen. We see that such hypothetical forms parallel
the intermediate level form suggested above for yingugurla (yingugngurla). We may
regard all of these as more regular by positing that they all undergo simplification of the
(boundary-only) cluster gng to g.
  The listing of examples in Table 4 breaks the examples into categories by sub-type as
discussed above.
  The usual elements of meaning contributed by this process include plurality (yi-birrba
Old', yi-birrbagbirrba 'the old people, the ancestors'), and in the case of verbal stems,
intensity and/or repetition:
        0-yanggi-ya              jarrambu         lurleg-lurle          lurleg-lurle
        3SG-go-PST-NAR            look            cryrdp                cryrdp

       '[Bird] went around looking, crying and crying and looking, and found it'.
  In barnag-barnang, based on the kin term yi-barnang 'aunt', there is some indication
that the specific element of intensity is intimacy, closeness, affection. This example first
turned up in a story by a woman telling of her childhood and her close relationship with
several older women, including a grandmother and her aunt, who always took her on foraging
expeditions and taught her about foods and country. A slightly expanded context is:

52 Chapter3   Finally, a couple of minor verbal reduplications deserve mention. The verb 'go' has
a common, reduplicative present tense which means ""to go along slowly and/or
continuously"". It is identical to the normal present tense (see 8.16.), but has an additional,
final reduplicative segment -ja. Thus, Ί go, am going' is nganja, the reduplicative form,
nganjaja; \EXNSGyirr-ya and reduplicative yirr-ya-ja, and so on. The \erbyana- 'say,
do' has a reduplicative stem form yana-jana-, which means 'do and do, keep on doing,
saying'.","[69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]"
"
11.2. Temporal clauses: -barra ~ -warra with finite verbs and
      particles
Dependent clauses meaning 'when, at the time when' may be formed with the suffix
-barra ~ -warra (see 5.4.) from both verbs and verb particles, but in the latter instance
exhibit some of the usual limitations of complement clauses based on particles.
  Temporal clauses with verbs tend to be used to express background conditions in
relation to another clause or series of them, and thus are often constructed with formally
subordinate predicates, as in this example:(654)   gorromogon        ngarr-gurrgba-n-ga-\varra           ya-wud-janga-yan
        early morning     UNPL-sleep-PRES-SUB-ADV             3-3NSG-come-POT
        ""They may come early in the morning when we are sleeping'.
                                             Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 271  A similar meaning would be expressed by the subordinate verb form without suffix;
but its addition seems to focus on simultaneity of the two actions or conditions expressed
by the predicates of clauses so linked. The suffix may be added to finite verb forms:(655)   nga-njigbe-warra          nana                  ya-0-nyangi-we          yiwarna-gari
        ISG-go-FUT-ADV            that-ABS              3-3SG-come-FUT           other-other
        'When I will go the other fellow will come'.
  The same suffix is added to verb particles, and these function as clause complements:
(1) designating the time at which something took place; or (2) as secondary predicates
with verbs of motion, the kind of action undertaken during or as a result ofthat motion.
In the first usage, the suffix is added to particles designating events, for example:(656)   lilg-ba-warra       barrunin        lag                  0-ngegba-rri
        dryup-ADV           fish-ABS        dessicate            3SG-AUX-PST
        'When it [water] dried, the fish died and dried up'.
  The particle lilg-ba is usually combined with ya- to mean 'dry up', and is often used
in reference to seasonal drying up of water bodies. Such minimal temporal complements
as these differ little from nominals designating seasons and conditions, similarly suffixed,
e.g., wu-jerrij-barra 'when it is cold, in cold-weather time'.
   As secondary predicates with verbs of motion, the complement clause may have a
Dative, semantically direct object, and further nominal complements are also Dative
marked. Common in this function is the particle gej-(ba) 'ask'; as clausal predicate with

  (Here as is often the case, the word meaning ""plain"" or ""flat ground"" is contextually
understood to refer and allude to ""ceremony ground"", and the activity of initiation
conducted there.) Gej-ba-warra has a semantically direct object, the person asked; and
that asked about is also Dative-marked (the nominal ""plain""; the more precise content of
the question is encoded in a clause linked to the preceding by the (usually) interrogative
pronoun ""when"", here functioning as a temporal relativizer.","[294, 295]"
"
10.10. The ordering of object, agent and subjectIn 10.1. I suggested that it is not possible to approach certain questions of word order
with only the issue of ""grammaticality"" in mind, in Wardaman and other Australian
languages. Informants, when asked, will approve different orders within the phrase and
the elicitation sentence as grammatically acceptable and meaningful. But another matter
is what they will actually say themselves, with all the attendant questions of relative
frequency of different orders, and the meaningful organization of textual matter. The
clause is the understood unit of analysis with respect to which summaries of major
constituent ordering are usually made (as in formulae such as SVO, SOV etc.). But this
assumes that issues of ordering are fundamentally issues of clause-level grammatical
structure. There are however many other issues besides grammaticality which have to
do with the occurrence and ordering of nominal constituents.
  Some observations drawn from text material will be summarized here about the
positioning of the direct object, the ergative-marked transitive agent, and the intransitive
subject. These observations were made on text material that had been organized into
tone units. As I noted above this chapter, this organization was basic in that no thorough
analysis into primary and secondary intonation units was made, although such further
study seems promising. Rather, a simple division into tone units or contours was made
on the main criterion of pitch movement (generally but not always strongly linked with
pause phenomena). Once this is done, it becomes possible to talk about ordering of overt
noun phrases fulfilling major syntactic functions within the tone unit and with respect to
an occurring verb.
  There is an important general issue of the lexical realization of participants. The other
side of the coin is ellipsis (and what may be somewhat different, failure for participants
to be lexically specified through local portions of text, a more general question of
narrative style that will not be further discussed). The fact that two nominal functions
may be marked on the inflecting Wardaman verb by pronominal prefixes is linked to the
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 247
 fact of extensive nominal ellipsis particularly of nominals in intransitive and transitive
 subject functions.
    For instance, in the text Jalijbang, the protagonist Moon is introduced lexically in unit
 (1) by his subsection, Yiwalyarri, but is not designated again lexically until unit (83),
where he is referred to as gandawag 'moon'. By that time he has been the understood
 agent of 31 transitive constructions and numerous intransitive ones. There is only one
 occurrence of an ergative-marked noun in the entire text of 110 units, at 102 where
 Moon's wives return, figure out what has happened, and say, Oh! here the old man-ERG
 is keeping/has his mother-in-law. The relatively straightforward story-line as told, one
 might say, makes it possible for Moon to be the understood and largely ellipsed agent
 and subject of numerous transitive and intransitive verbs (and, interestingly, in this story
 the object of none).
   In the text Gawalyan, the first main character introduced is echidna herself. She is
 identified by the single noungawalyan 'echidna' on the first tone unit of the text. This
 is not ergative-marked, despite the fact that the next unit gives the information ""She had
 a small child"". The naming of echidna simply identifies her, and carries no clear
 indication of grammatical function. Such naming as the content of a tone unit, amounting
to apposition of participants rather than specification of grammatical function, is a
 common feature of Wardaman text. In the Gawalyan text, echidna is not lexically
identified again until line 26, where some birds ask her husband to lend his wife
 fyingawuyu) to them for sexual intercourse. This request, with lexical designation of
echidna as ""wife"", is repeated in line 28. Then there is no further lexical identification
of echidna until a final one in line 43, where she is described as having beenyibarnbarnin
'naked, hairless', until she was speared for refusing the birds, and so acquired quills.
There is no instance of ergative-marked agent in the entire text; for after the aggressor
birds have been lexically identified once (in lines 22 and 23, on tone units which name
them in absolutive case form), they are designated only by pronominal prefixes (subject
and object) on the verb throughout the remainder of the text.
   The two cases above might be among the texts where there is least lexical designation
of protagonists, and reference maintenance to protagonists principally through
pronominal prefixation. A text which shows more considerable lexical specification of
protagonists is Gumurrinji and Bornorron ""Emu and Brolga"". Here, emu asks brolga to
mind her children along with brolga's own while emu goes out foraging, and as in some
Shakespearean plots, there is ample possibility for confusioa Perhaps for that reason,
emu is lexically designated 6 times in a relatively short text, as is brolga; three of the
latter occurrences are Ergative-marked, as brolga maliciously destroys emu's children
while she is away. Nevertheless there is no case in which both agent and object are
lexically specified on the same tone unit, and thus no specific evidence for the ordering
of ""brolga"" and ""emu"" with respect to each other as lexemes in particular major syntactic
functions. Overall, lexical specification of agent and object in the same tone unit is rare
textually, but there are instances (such as Dalyarra line 30, ""two-ERG women- ERG held
her legs-ABS on either side"", or the order AVO).
   In attempting to calculate the occurrence of overt nominals as agents, subjects and
objects, it seemed important to distinguish cases in which they occurred within the same
248 Chapter 10tone unit as the verbal word(s) bearing pronominal agreement, versus those in which they
occurred on another tone group (often, set off as simple nouns or nominal expressions
on a tone unit by themselves in absolutive form, or sometimes with case specification).
Table 18 shows tabulations derived from 24 texts of nominal (including pronominal)
elements in given functions — as direct objects, intransitive subjects, and (ergative-
marked) agents, and their position pre- or post-verbally within the tone unit.","[270, 271, 272]"
"5.2.1. Ergative and instrumental casesCase-marking of the transitive subject nominal is formally identical to marking of the
instrumental one. However, the two case functions can be distinguished syntactically in
that the instrumental noun is not marked in the verb. The following exemplify Ergative

  Ergative typically marks the nominal transitive subject even where there may be no
expressed nominal object, but only object marking on the verb (zero for third person
singular. See 10.10. for discussion of the ordering of lexically realized nominal
functions).
  There are a number of verbal meanings for which pairs of verbs are found, one member
of the pair transitively used, the other intransitively. Examples are the pairs burla-ma-
'deceive, lie to' and burla-yi- 'tell lies'; geng-ma- 'to fear' and gengmi-yi- 'be afraid of
(with Dative object). The ""mediopassive"" forms appear to be used more frequently to
designate typical disposition, the others to designate particular events; thus,
ya-wurr-burla-yi-n is often used to mean 'they tell lies' (typically). (See 8.12. for the
'mediopassive' category.)
  By ""ditransitive"" constructions are meant those in which there are two notional (and
sometimes, overtly expressed or non-zero) objects. One of these is typically animate,
and generally, but not always, also human, the notional ""indirect object""; the other is
usually inanimate, the notional ""direct object"" of the action. Verbs or verb plus particle
constructions which are typical predicates of such clauses, include: wo- 'give to';jewu-
'show to, teach'; also birrg gerne- 'to take from', mowo- 'to steal from\jomarna~ 'finish'
(e.g., food). Examples with such predicates illustrate the case-marking of associated
nominals:
66 Chapters(8)    yarrimanbu-yi  birrg     0-geme-rri
       taipan-ERG     take      3SG-AUX-PST
       yirlorloban          0-geme-rri                     birrg         mawuya

        'Taipan took it away, he took the poison away from King Brown'.
  Here, the first prosodic line is equivalent to a clause, with Ergative-marked nominal
""taipan"", but no overt nominal object. That object is made overt initially in the following
line by Absolutive-marked ""King Brown"", the notional indirect object. Notional direct
object is expressed by Absolutive-marked ""poison"".(9)    ngani-jomarna-rri          mayin               gabarn         ngong-jomarna-rri
       2SG/lSG-finish-PST         food-ABS            and/in turn    lSG/2SG-finish-PST
        'You finished off my food and [in turn] I finished yours'.(10)   nganburr-wo-n                  wu-munburra               wurre-mulu-yi
       3NSG/lSG-give-PRES             WU-money-ABS              child-PL-ERG
        ""The children give me money'.
  Here the notional indirect object ""me"" is expressed by object pronominal only in the
verb; notional direct object ""money"" outside the verb only by Absolutive noun; and
transitive subject by Ergative-marked 'children'.(11)   ngan-jewu-rri               madin
       3SG/lSG-show-PST            language-ABS
        'She taught me language'.
  Here again, notional indirect object is expressed only on the verb, as is typical (although
emphasis could be given by use of the Absolutive independent 1SG pronoun). There
could be Ergative-marked nominal transitive subject. A ditransitive construction of this
kind contrasts syntactically with one involving verb particle plus auxiliary of similar
meaning, but in which the indirect object is expressed with the Dative (see 5.2.3.), and
the notional direct object, once again with Absolutive-marked nominal:(12)   milid        0-gi-ndi                nganu              madin
       show         3SG-AUX-PST             1SGDAT             language-ABS
       'She taught me language'.(13)   jurd              0-bu-ndi               nganu           laglan

       'She showed the place to me'.
  The verb yana- 'to say (to)' usually occurs with Dative ""person to whom"" something
is said. However, it has alternatively been found to occur with ""person to whom"" treated
as direct object, as in the following example where it occurs with particle jarnbab 'try
                                                     Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 67to, persist in (unsuccessfully)' (Kriol 'hard work (la)'). Compare the alternative case
frames:(14)   jambab wurr-yana-rri           yinggi    wonggo              yinimburr-wo-n
        try   3NSG-say-PST            you-SGDAT not                 3NSG/2SG-give-PRES
       'They kept on telling you they won't give you [any, anything]'.(15)   jambab           yimburr-yana-rri              wonggo         yinimburr-wo-n
        try             3NSG/2SG-say-PST              not            3NSG/2SG-give-PRES
       'They kept telling you they won't give you [any, anything]'.
  As already noted, nominals functioning instrumentally can be distinguished from
transitive subject nominals in that they are not in agreement with pronominal marker on
the verb. For example, the verb ba- 'burn, thirst, perish' most typically enters into two
kinds of constructions: one, with intransitive subject (usually marked only on the verb
by prefix) and dative complement expressing that for which one is burning (wiya-wu 'for
water'); and one with intransitive subject, the experiencer, and instrumental complement
expressing that which is causing one to thirst or burn:(16)   nga-ba-n                    marninggani-yi
       ISG-burn-PRES               sun-INST
       'I'm burning in the sun'.
  Since ""sun"" can never show verbal agreement, it is regarded as Instrument rather than
transitive subject. Instrument thus marks the nominal that expresses the means by which
an action is accomplished, as distinct from the agent of the action, the transitive subject.
Other examples of Instrumental nominals are:(17)   badbad-ngana-yi          yirr(w)un-ga-n                        lurrbu     lagla-warr

       'You [NSG] douse it with water, douse [SG] the light with water, let only
       charcoal be there'.
  In this example, two approximate synonyms meaning ""douse, extinguish"" occur with
Instrumental-marked ""water"".

  In (19), the substance with which something is filled is treated as Instrument. The same

  (23) illustrates the occurrence within the same clause of overt Ergative-marked
transitive subject, and Instrumental noun.

                          Chapter 12
       Clausal particles, conjunctions, and interjections
12.1. Introduction
In this chapter are drawn together several functionally diverse categories of elements,
most of them categorizable as ""particles"" in having independent word status, and not
inflecting. However, some of the forms discussed in this chapter are clitics, and others
(like marrig, 12.2.1.) are clitic-like in usually occupying a determinate position
(following the first full word) of the clause. Beyond that, the forms are divisible into at
least three functional sets, with a degree of overlap between any two, in that some forms
may be assigned to more than one set.
  The first set, called ""clausal particles"", function to subcategorize the predicate in terms
of modal semantics, and occur in construction with the entire clause. To an extent, some
of these clausal particles tend to occur with certain tense-aspect-mood inflectional forms
of the verb (as gala 'try' often occurs with future), but most are not as clearly restricted
in this way. One, bujun 'if etc., occurs frequently in the construction of conditional
clauses, but this is not its sole function. Other members of this set, such as yilama 'might
be' freely occur with a range of different verb forms, and generally introduce a meaning
of speaker speculation or hypothesis ""I suppose"" etc.
  The second set, ""conjunctions"", generally function to specify ""the way in which what
is to follow is systematically connected to what has gone before"" (Halliday and Hasan
1976: 227). Several different semantic sub-types of conjunctive relations are
distinguished.
  The third set, ""interjections"", are forms which constitute a complete utterance by
themselves. However, while they may do so formally, interjections are of course also
cohesive, and express comment partly on elements of the communicative situation, rather
than simply upon its prepositional content. To the extent that they do the former, they
are conjunctive in the general sense given above. We find therefore that one of the major
conjunctions, ngala 'but, however', also occurs as interjection.
  There is a small set of forms (two independent words, and one clitic) that combine
text-cohesive and interjectional properties in a way that does not lend itself to neat
labelling or classification; these are discussed as a sub-class of (most explicitly)
""interpersonal elements"", a label not intended to suggest that other formal classes and
elements do not have an interpersonal dimension.","[314, 315]"

8.16. Verb paradigms: The CV- roots, and irregular verbs ya- 'go'
      and vw- 'be'The tense-aspect forms of 13 CV roots, and also of the bisyllabic roots megbe- 'break,
snap', nyanga- 'come' andjingi- 'sit' are shown in Table 14. The latter are included
because they are the only bisyllabic roots to take the Past suffix form -ndi; all other verbs
besides these three, and some of the CV roots, take -ra. It can be seen that, for the most
part, the paradigms are highly predictable and regular. Of all of these verbs, only nyanga-
has a distinctive Future stem-form. The stem-form required in 'admonitive' Irrealis
constructions is not separately listed, but is the same as that which occurs in the Future
tense, minus the tense suffix -wa. The stem form of the positive imperative is the same
as that of Present tense, minus the tense suffix -n, the allomorph found with all the verbs
listed.
  What might be considered a sixteenth CV- root, the verb 'go', requires full paradigmatic
specification because of its irregularity. The forms are set out in Table 15.
  In the Present, two stem forms can be identified, ya- where the immediately preceding
element is nonsingular morpheme -rr-, and -Nja elsewhere. The initial nasal of the latter
stem varies here (as it does throughout the paradigm). Where it immediately follows the
shape yi- (of 2SG, 1INDU), the nasal is palatal; where it follows a or u, it is plain alveolar.
There has clearly been an historical assimilatory process at work in determining the
specification of the nasal.
  Morpheme breaks are not indicated in the Past forms because of their irregularity.
There may be specified two general stem forms, one -(y)anggi following -rr-, and -Njagi,
where the same historical assimilatory processes mentioned above are evident. There
are two further irregularities, however. The 3SG Past is yanggi; and the 1INPL form
which we would expect to be ngarr- (y)anggi is instead ngadjanggi, indicating that in
this form the history of the relationship between -rr- and the following stem is different
than in the 1EXNSG and 3NSG forms to which it is ordinarily analogous. Here as in
some other paradigmatic forms (e.g., Potential) there is a ""trade-off between presence
versus absence of nasal in the stem, and the presence or absence of one in the apparent
form of the suffix. That is, where the form of the root in the past is evidently -ya-, the
past tense marker has a nasal -nggi; but where the root has a nasal, Nja-, the past tense
element is plain -gi.
  On this basis we may say that the Potential has two stem-suffix forms, -Nja-gan, and
-ya-nggan, the latter following -rr- in the expected categories, 1EXNSG, 1INPL and
3NSG. There must be posited both a simple stem form as given, and a doubled one, to
account for the occurrence following -rr- of Potential forms such as 1EXNSG
yirrajanggan, to be analyzed as /yirr-ya-ja-nggan/, with internal hardening of the
reduplicated stem, for example:(473) yirmg-bulu                 gabarri      yirr-ajanggan                  gangga-rlan
      1EXNSG-PL-ABS              also         lEXNSG-go rdp-POT              upriver-ALL
        'We too may go higher up'.

the two basic stem-suffix shapes -Njigbe and -yingbe. The former with initial nasal has
medial g, while the latter with initial palatal continuant has medial velar nasal. It seems
that here too in at least two forms which have the morpheme -rr-, we should identify two
alternative stem forms, a simple and a doubled one, for while these forms are usually as
given, there have been recorded the additional forms 1EXNSG yirr-iyingbe, and 1INPL
ngarr-iyingbe, i.e., suggesting an alternative stem-suffix form -yiyingbe. (No
                                                               Categories of the finite verb 201
comparable form was recorded for 3NSG.) Those given in Table 15 however, are the
usual forms, showing deletion of the palatal glide following -rr-.
  There is additionally a ""second"" Future paradigm, which differs both formally and
semantically from the first, but is much less commonly used. This second Future appears
to have stem shapes -Njiji, -yijingbe, and -Njigbe, thus showing (in the last two forms)
trade-offs between nasal segment stem— initially versus before the Future suffix; but
additionally, showing the distinctive Future stem shape -Njiji. Note that the paradigms
of ""first"" and ""second"" Futures are not completely distinct, for they have common 1INDU
and 3NSG forms. In 1INPL, 1EXNSG and 3NSG, however (i.e., just where there is
nonsingular -rr-), there occurs the doubled stem form -yijingbe, with internal hardening.
This contrasts directly with the few doubled forms without hardening reported in the
previous paragraph (with stem -yiyingbe).
  Forms of this additional Future paradigm have been found mainly in clauses introduced
by the particle gala 'try' (see further 12.2.3.), and also in clauses where they express
obligation, necessity or inevitability in the way Future forms usually do, for example:(474)   yanjiji          wirrig
        3-3SG-go        tomorrow
        'He must• go
                  e> tomorrow'
(475)   ngayugu          gala     nganjiji    jarrambu        gunga
        1SG-ABS         try        ISG-go      looking        3SG-DAT
        Til try to go look for him'.
  The / vocalism of these forms suggests that they are essentially doubled forms of the
Future stem, and (the singulars) old relics of earlier Future formation, without the
distinctive but presumably more recent suffix -wa.
  The present Irrealis forms, given for the sake of completeness, show the alternation
between a stem -ya following -rr- in 1EXNSG, 1INPL and 3NSG, and a stem -Nja
elsewhere. In these forms, the palatal nasal occurs following the Irrealis 2SG person
marker -ni-, and likewise, the 3SG form has palatal nasal following the third person
Irrealis prefix complex yayi-. The Habitual shows the same patterning.
  Although ""admonitive"" is not elsewhere listed as a separate paradigmatic category, it
is worth doing so here because the relationship between Future and admonitive is not
apparently as straightforward as usual — although examination will show that the
admonitive stem forms may in fact be arrived at by eliminating final -gbe or -ngbe from
the corresponding Future forms.
  Finally, there appears to be wider categorial function than usual of the Potential forms.
Although Future (as noted in 8.6. above) is the preferred category in the protasis of
non-past conditionals, there have been recorded several examples of Potential stems
forms of ""go"", with reduction of final -n, and Irrealis prefixation, in the protasis of
non-past conditionals:
202 Chapters(476) bujun       yi-ni-nyjaga       nan-garr          yi-ni-me          wurren
      if          IRR-2SG-go         that-ALL          IRR-2SG-get       child-ABS

        'If he goes inside, I may hunt them all away'.
  It seems to be the case for ""go"" that Potential forms may be understood to express
volition, intention and necessity in the way that Future does for the majority of verbs.
Thus informants apparently understand Potential ngarranggan wirrig-bi and Future
ngarringbe wirrig-bi to mean something very similar, 'We shall/must go early'. As with
other verbs, however, Future is the preferred form of jussive complement clauses:(478) nan-yi             ngan-yana-rri                 nganjigbe
      that-ERG           3SG/lSG-say-PST               1SG-FUT
        'He/that one told me I must go'.
  Hortative and positive Imperative categories attest the stem forms ya~ and Nja-.
  The verb yu- (reduplicated form yuju-, and generally with auxiliary function) 'to be,
be in a place, exist' is defective in having only Present and non-past subordinate forms.
The latter is irregular: the expected yu-n-ga is not found, the occurring form being
yungga. In other tense-aspect categories, parts of the verb of being and location, jingi-,
are used. Examples of the occurrence of yu- are:(479)   bardab-marla              ya-0-yuju            ngamanda-wu

12. Close linguistic relationships
Wardaman is a close congener of Yangman and Dagoman (see 1.3., also Map 2). From
available information, the three may apparently be considered dialects of a single
language. They were of such a degree of structural and lexical similarity as to be mutually
intelligible.
  Dagoman is no longer spoken in the Katherine region. There were formerly speakers
at Manbulloo Station and in Katherine town camps, and a few others at Pine Creek. The
writer did a small amount of work on Dagoman in the late 1970s with a reputed ""last""
speaker at Pine Creek, Mrs. Martha Hart, who, after long infirmity, passed away in 1982.
The amount of information I succeeded in collecting is small. There is a short word list,
and paradigmatic information (with gaps) on the system of nominal case and derivational
suffixation, tense-aspect in the verb, independent pronouns, and demonstratives. In the
data are also intransitive and some transitive pronominal combinations which are
prefixed to the verb, but the speaker was unable to recall all of them. The data are
sufficient to establish beyond doubt that Dagoman was a close congener of both
Wardaman and Yangman.
                                                                                 Introduction 3   Yangman is no longer actively used. Yangman had been most widely spoken at Elsey
Station and the neighbouring town of Mataranka, but the numbers of active speakers
among these people and their descendants have dwindled. Among those with the best
knowledge of the language are now a number of Mangarrayi people at the excision
community, Jilkminggan [Jilgmirn.gan], on Elsey Station, and a small number of people
at Barunga, a settlement to the north of the Roper River. The Mangarrayi have lived and
intermarried with the Yangman at least since the building of Elsey Station on the Roper
River in the early years of this century (see Merlan 1978).
   Though I have collected Yangman material from Mangarrayi people, I consider my
most significant data to have come from Mr. Jimmy Daniels, who was widely regarded
around Mataranka in the early 1980s as a (if not the) senior Yangman person, and the
only remaining person for whom Yangman was not only his ""own"" and ""proper""
language, but also his first language. He passed away in 1986 after prolonged and chronic
illness. Though Mr. Daniels consented to work with me on different occasions, his
personal preference was not to use or even think about Yangman much, as he told me.
Having spent quite a number of years as a highly regarded grounds worker on a station
in the region, he seemed to find the illness-ridden, less structured existence of his
""retirement"" years somewhat disspiriting and frustrating.
   I am grateful for the information he provided, which includes about 500 lexical items,
fuller paradigmatic information than I could gather for Dagoman, and a couple of short
stories. From these data it is possible to be certain of the close genetic relation of
Yangman to Wardaman. Work with him also provided some measure of the extent to
which first-language Mangarrayi speakers with whom I did work on Yangman, were
interpolating Mangarrayi vocabulary. Most showed a tendency to use some words which
Mr Daniels rejected as not Yangman. I can only assume they are probably more prone
to do this now than the same people would have been twenty or thirty years ago, when
there were some Yangman people around who, because of their identity and use of the
language, kept it more current in the local communities among second-language
speakers.
  Finally, though Wardaman and its congeners appear to share considerable vocabulary
and many typological features with Wakiman to the north (see Cook 1987), it cannot
presently be stated with certainty what the nature of the relationship is, although my own
view is that Wakiman is closely related to Wardaman-Yangman, and has diverged from
them partly due to influence from neighbouring Arnhem-area languages.
  In certain basic ways, such as phonemic inventory, Wakiman differs significantly from
its presumed close congeners, Wardaman and Yangman: it has two stop series
intervocalically (e.g., a contrast between bilabials b and;?, apicals d and t, etc.); there is
no phonemic distinction between alveolar and retroflex apical stops, which is
fundamental in all the other languages; it has glottal stop, which is not even phonetically
of any significant occurrence in Wardaman, Yangman, or Dagoman, and so on. However,
when one considers the possible diffusional influences of neighbouring Amhem-area
languages on Wakiman in some of these matters, it still seems quite possible that its
closest congeners may be the Wardaman-Yangman-Dagoman grouping. Typologically,
in certain very significant ways, such as the syntactic deployment of what I call verbal
4 Chapter 1
""particles"" (see Chapter 9) and Cook calls ""participles"", Wakiman is very like Wardaman
and Yangman, and all of them taken together differ dramatically not only from regional
Arnhem languages like Jawoyn which do not rely on such verbal particles to any
significant extent, but also from languages like Mangarrayi which do. In Mangarrayi
(see Merlan 1982) the syntactic deployment of verb particles is very different from the
possibilities in Wakiman and Wardaman etc., and rather limited in comparison with the
latter grouping of languages.","[26, 27, 28]"
"
7.2. Demonstrative categories and some related forms
The demonstrative pronouns, may serve either as modifiers within a nominal phrase, or
like all sub-types of nominal in Wardaman, may by themselves constitute the sole,
reference-making member of a nominal phrase. As modifiers, they normally occur
within a phrase preceding the modified, but the reverse order may be found (10.3., 10.9.).
As modifiers and arguments, the demonstrative pronouns may be inflected for the range
of nominal case-suffixes.
  The system of demonstratives shows a tripartite division in terms of spatial categories
which will be called ""Immediate"", ""Proximate"" and ""Remote"". These categories are
roughly translatable in English as ""this"", ""that"" and ""yonder"", and the spatial and textual
semantics of all of them will be illustrated below. In summary fashion, the spatial
reference of the Immediate category is in the vicinity of the speech situation, and may
designate within the vicinity of the speaker, hearer or both. Something that is designated
as ""that"" in the sense of distal from speaker but close to hearer is liable to be coded with
the Proximate category, but never with the remote category as it is still within range of
the location of the speech event. The Immediate and Remote categories are the most
closely linked in most of their uses to spatial semantics, although forms of the immediate
category may have textually immediate reference to that just said or about to be said.
The Remote category is most restricted to spatial reference in the extra-linguistic context
138 Chapter?(as opposed to linguistic), and its use seems to be to refer to things, objects, locations etc.
which are generally visible from the location of the speech event, or portrayed as visible
from the perspective of a narrated or reported speech event, but in either case distal from
it.
   This leaves relatively unspecified the proximate category, which is in fact widest of the
three in its range of uses, and the least restricted in its textual and other extended
distribution. As noted above, it may designate within the general vicinity of the speech
situation something that is distal from speaker and close to hearer, or something that is
distal from both but still relatively close. Further, it is the category generally used to
code the textual familiarity of some nominal, where its use often amounts to specification
of definiteness of the referent via its proximate text-spatial semantics. In this definite-
marking usage it is often best translated by English definite article. It is also the category
most widely used to mark the relation of units of text to others, by means of inflected
forms which mean such things as ""and then, after that"", and so on.
  Case forms in the three series are shown in Table 12. Stem morphology is not
complicated: each series has an Absolutive form, and a stem-form used with non-zero
suffixes. The two stems differ most unpredictably for the remote category.","[161, 162]"
"  Demonstratives are also freely used in two-word noun phrases where the second
element does not itself name an entity, but where the reference of the nominal word is
assumed to be otherwise established or known:(537) nana yiwarnagari            'the other (one)'
(538)    nana            lege              0-waja-rri             jid
         that-ABS        one-ABS           3SG-leave-PST           stand
        'He left the one standirg upright'.
  Demonstratives may also b; found in a phrase with a second genitive or dative
pronominal word, where it may be assumed that the entity word has been ellipsed:(539) nana go           'the οη<ϊ of his/hers'  Although the order DEM + Ν is the most common, the reverse order is also found. This
is examined further for phrases containing the Proximate demonstrative in 10.9. Though
we have said that DEM + N ord<;r is the most common, it is important to note an exception
to this: that those demonstrate e forms termed ""collective"", characterized by ending in
-ganung following one of the demonstrative stems (7.2.), typically follow the nominal
that they specify:(540)    bangbun       dang-ganung      wunggunburr-ga-ndi                   gunya
         woman-ABS yonder COL-AB S 3NSG/3NSG-take-PST                        3SG-DISS
        'They took those womtn away from him'.(541) mog     wurr-me-ndi                   layin               dan-ganung
       smell 3NSG-AUS-F'ST                  meat-ABS            this-COLABS
      'They smelled the meat'.
230 Chapter 10(542) gajigaji          0-nyanga-ndi         wolon           nan-ganung
      walk              3SG-come-PST         grass-ABS       that-COL-ABS
        'The grass came walking'.
  (Note that where the specified nominal is non-human, it is treated in verbal prefixation
as if singular, despite ""collective"" suffixation on the demonstrative.) There are however
exceptions to the generalization that collective forms tend to follow the nominal:(543)   wunggunburr-ga-ndi-wan            nan-ganung-nyi        yibiyan-yi
        3NSG/3NSG-take-PST-DF             that-COL-ERG          man-ERG
        'Those Aborigines took them away'.
  In two-word noun phrases containing a number word and lexical noun, there appear to
be slightly more cases in which the number word precedes the nominal. This tendency
is most noticeable in respect to the number words lege One', guyamin 'two', and
murrgun 'three'; whereas in phrases with nominal modified by ngawurnen 'many', the
modifier seems equally likely to precede or follow. Examples of the most frequent

        'She would stay for three months'.
 An instance of the slightly less common ordering is:(546)   a        0-na-rri        marluga            lege
        oh       3SG-see-PST     oldman-ABS         one-ABS
        'Ah! he saw one old man'.
  With respect to the textual frequency of numbers generally, it might seem that because
the language has morphological categories that express dual number, the numeral ""two""
would be infrequent. This is not so, however; there is rather a tendency for ""two"" to be
expressed pleonastically in noun phrases where dual is also overtly marked. (See e.g.,
the text Mejern, line 235, for examples such as bangbu-wuya guyamin woman-DU-ABS
two-ABS, 'two women'.)
  Interrogative modifiers invariably precede the nominal:(547)   ngamanda        menyin            yiwun-wo-ndi              mululurru
         what-ABS       cheek-ABS         2SG/3NSG-give-PST         old woman rdp-ABS

        who-ABS            old man-ABS
        'Which old man'? or 'Old man who?'.
  Indefinites tend to precede tt e nominal with which they occur, but the reverse order is
also found:(549) yiwarna-mulu           yib'.yan-mulu
      other-PL-ABS           mai-PL-ABS
        'Some other men'.(550) yijarlu              wurren
      some-ABS             child-ABS
        'Some children'.
  The structure of possessive loun phrases is discussed in 10.4. Where possession is
expressed by genitive pronoun modifying the nominal, the order pronoun-nominal is
most common in the textual corpus. However, here again the opposite order, though less
common, is certainly well attes :ed. In (551) the most common order is illustrated; in (552)
both orders are illustrated.(551) yinggawun-mulu              wurre-mulu
      yours-PL-ABS                child-PL-ABS
        'Your children'.(552) (0-jarrambu-rri)            gungan.gin-gu         wurre-wu

        'Where are my children?'
  Of the many other qualifiers which specify properties or characteristics of entities (e.g.,
of size, shape, colour, texture, condition of use, taste etc.), it may be suggested that word
length may have something to do with ordering freedom with respect to a modified
nominal. It is in any event noticeable that several short modifiers (ones of no more than
two syllables, e.g., -jad 'big', \vudu 'little', and -man 'good') may apparently occur
indifferently before or after tht modified nominal, for example:(553)   wudu         wumunb.irra              yani-ma jurd-ba
        little-ABS   WU-rock-ABS             thus-PS show-PS

(554)   gabarani         wudu
        oops-ABS         little-ABS
        'His little unmentionable'.
  It may be the case that qualifiers of two or three syllables (including noun class prefix),
no matter what their semantic type, have the greatest freedom of occurrence either before
or after the nominal. Certainly they seem to precede the nominal more often than do
longer modifiers. Other examples are:(555)   wangi            wu-juda               madin
        only             WU-short-ABS          word-ABS

        YI-old-ABS       woman-ABS          that-ABS
        'That's an old [i.e., long-term pregnant] woman'.
 Longer modifiers tend to follow the noun, but this ordering is by no means absolute.
The reverse order is acceptable, if less common.(557)   barrangardba       wu-warringun
        throat-ABS         WU-bad-ABS
        'Bad throat, sore throat'.(558)   wurrguru         yi-wungij-gun
        devil-ABS        YI-dark-of

        YI-head-ABS        YI-long-ABS
        'Along head'.(560)   mayin           ma-durrudban
        food-AB S       M Α-round-AB S
        Ά round vegetable'.
  When demonstrative and longer qualifier occur in the same tone group with a modified
nominal, demonstrative always occurs in first position, and there is a strong tendency for
the qualifier to occur flanking the nominal on the right:(561) nana              marluga             yi-belyangman
      that-ABS          old man-ABS         YI-red-ABS
        'That old part-Aboriginal [""red""] man'.
                                                      Issues in constituency and word order 233
  This tendency is also true of modifiers formed with ""having"" suffix, which in general
tend to follow any open-class nominal with which they occur, e.g., nana marluga
wiya-warang 'the old drunk man'. This tendency is not apparently as strong with the
shorter qualifiers, e.g., nana wi'.du wurren 'the small child' and nana yijad wurren 'the
big child' are perfectly acceptable, as is e.g., nana wurren yijad.
  Although the indefinite qualifier yiwarnagari 'a different one, another' is long, it
appears to have considerable freedom of occurrence, pre- or post-nominal, in two-word
and longer noun phrases, e.g. yiwarnagari laglan or laglan yiwarnagari 'another,
different camp'. As noted in 5.9., there is a tendency for the concept of ""difference"" or
otherness to be marked pleonas ically on the nominal as well as by this modifier, and this
appears to happen where thi modifier precedes the nominal, e.g., yiwarnagari
laglan-gari 'a different camp'. It may be noted, also, that when it precedes the nominal
it may occur in a shortened form, minus -gari: yiwarna bangbun 'another woman',
yiwarna wiyan 'next year, another year'. The latter phrase is in fact standard in the
meaning 'next year, next rainy season'. (One does not standardly find yiwarna wiyan-
gari as a set phrase.) Yiwarnagari invariably follows any occurring demonstrative.(562)   lurrbu yirr-(y)anggi: nan-garr              marluga-warr         yiwarnagari-warr
        back   lEXNSG-go-^ST that-ALL               oldman-ALL           different-ALL
        go
        3SG-DAT
        'We went home to her other old man'.
  An example of a noun phrases with pronominal head (""me"") and further specification
of location is:(563) jumba          jingi       nganunya           banggin-ya
       behind        sit         1SG-DISS           back-LOC
        'Sit behind me/at my back'.
  Alternatively, a meaning of ι he above sort may be constructed with a nominal head
(""back"") and possessive pronoun (here an independent dative one):(564) jumba             nga-jim>i-ndi        go               banggin-ya
       behind           ISG-sii-PST          3SG-DAT          back-LOC
        Ί sat behind him/at the back of him'.
   Both pronominal and nominal heads in the two examples above occur in relation to but
separate from the adverbial jumba 'behind' , and it is common for only adverbial and verb
to occur (jumba jingi 'sit behind'). See 10.4. for further discussion of possession.
   Some three-word noun phrases have already been illustrated in examples above, and
it should be clear that they are lot uncommon, although certainly they are textually less
frequent than two- or one-word ones. Common enough types include those with
demonstrative, open-class noriinal and semantically adjectival nominal (nana mayin
me-belbelin 'the/that round vegetable food'), and those with genitive pronominal first in
234 Chapter 10
the phrase followed by nominal and qualifier, where the order of the latter two is
apparently not fixed but depends on other factors. For example, one may encounter
nganinggin yiwarlng yibirrba or nganinggin yibirrba yiwarlng 'my old clothes', where
the condition-of-use qualifier shows the flexibility of ordering we have already noted for
many (apparently relatable to the length of the modifying word). However, as we have
already noted, collective-marked demonstratives strongly tend to follow any nominal
with which they occur, and this was found to always be the case in such examples in
phrases of more than two words: nganinggin yiwarlng dan-ganung 'my clothes, these
clothes of mine'.
  Expansions of simpler noun phrase types are possible with the occurrence of adverbials
and inflected nouns which elaborate the reference of an adjectival or open-class nominal,
or number word functioning as phrasal head. Such adverbials and embedded phrases
often express such notions as origin or source, for example:(565)   gangma-wunba                 yi-nebel
        kangaroo-SOU-AB S            ΥΙ-shoulder bone-ABS
        'The shoulder bone of/from a kangaroo'.(566) gorro-wunba-wuya             guyamin
      south-SOU-DU-ABS             two-ABS
        'The pair of them from the south'.
  Somewhat uncommonly, such elaborations may result in phrases of up to four words
occurring on one tone unit, rarely more than that:(567)   yiwarnagari      dawung-jila          gorro-wunba        bangbun
        other-ABS        thatway-ORIG         south-SOU          woman-ABS
        Ά foreign woman from that way to the south'.
  Some definite ordering tendencies within the phrase may be given as follows:
  (1) in noun phrases with pronominal head (such as yirrug-bulu yi-nimanyug-bulu 'we
EXCL people of Nimanyug') the pronominal occurs initially, followed by any modifier,
including number word.
  (2) in non-pronominal noun phrases, demonstratives generally occur preceding any
nominal, except as noted in the case of the collective-marked demonstrative forms, which
strongly tend to follow any occurring nominal. Also, number words (especially those
from one to three) tend to precede any nominal with which they occur, but this is a much
weaker tendency than the former. Genitive pronouns tend to precede the nominal they
modify, but this too is a weaker tendency than the first.
  (3) other modifiers — roughly, adjectival ones — tend to follow the modified nominal;
but certain very common ones of three syllables or less appear to have greater freedom
of ordering, either preceding or following the modified nominal.
  See also below some discussion of ordering in the possessive phrase (10.4.), in ""classifier""
or generic-specific constructions (10.5.), in the negated noun phrase (10.6.); and in
discontinuous phrases (10.7.).
