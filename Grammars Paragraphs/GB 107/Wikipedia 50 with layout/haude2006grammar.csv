12.5.1. kas: main clause negation
The particle kas forms a negative clause (cf. 7.15.1). At the same time, the predicate is
morphologically modified. In the canonical negative clause, this is achieved with action
nominalization through -wa when the predicate is a verb or through infixing reduplication
when the predicate is a morphological noun (cf. 11.1.1):(221)   kas ona-ye-na-wa=sne                  os juyeni n-as      Tirinra
        NEG know-BE.person-DR-NMZ=f.a ART.n.p person obl-ART.n Trinidad
        ‘She didn’t know anyone in Trinidad.’           {EA, Llegada hija 010}(222)   jelew-’im,            kas      pa<ya~>yak-a=as

        ‘(It was) a bright night, it wasn’t dark.’                      {EA, Escape 050}When the predicate in the negative clause already contains a negative affix, it is not
additionally nominalized. In (223) and (224), the predicate contains the irrealis infix <a’> (cf.
10.3). The predicate in (225) contains the mental-state suffix -baycho, which typically has a
negative meaning (cf. 10.5).(223)   kas rey yok-a’-na=as                n-is         majniwa=a

        DSC       PRO.1sg NEG here-PRC-MST
        ‘I don’t want to be here anymore.’                              {EA, Cbba 035}The negative particle kas is special in that it resembles very much the neuter article. First of
all, it has similar syntactic properties: kas precedes a predicate which is nominalized, in the
same way in which the neuter article precedes a nominalized predicate in subordinate clauses,
shown in (226) and (227):(226)   bo         as      ona-ye-wa=sne
        REAS       ART.n know-BE.person-NMZ=f.a
        ‘so that she might get to know X (a person)’(227)   n-as           pa<ya~>yak-a=as
        obl-ART.n.p dark<NMZ.N~>-LV=n.a
        ‘when it is dark’
                                                                                             543
Morphologically, the negative particle and the neuter article are similar as well. First of all,
both occur before action nouns (cf. 11.1.1):(228)   a. kas      chi:-wa=a              b. as        chi:-wa=a
           NEG go_out-NMZ=n                   ART.n go_out-NMZ=n
           ‘It doesn’t come/go out.’          ‘its coming/going out’Second, not only the article, but also the negative particle is phonologically conflated with the
first-person marker (cf. 4.4):(229)   a. ka         chi:-wa            b. a        chi:-wa
           NEG.1 go_out-NMZ                 ART.n.1 go_out-NMZ
           ‘I don’t come/go out.’           ‘my coming/going out’This morphological parallel with the article suggests that the final element s of the negative
particle is the same determining element that occurs on the article and on demonstratives,
described in 3.9.3 and 4.4.
  A third parallel between the negative particle and the article concerns the form of this
particle, kas, and the organization of the article paradigm (cf. 4.4). Recall from 4.4 that the
absential article is always contains an initial k; for example, the presential masculine article is
us, and the absential masculine article is kus. The absential neuter article, kos, is irregular in
that it is not only marked by k, but also has a different vowel than the presential neuter article,
as. The form that would be expected to represent the absential neuter article is kas. However,
the morpheme kas functions as the negative particle. Historically, therefore, it is possible that
the negative particle originates from the article paradigm, and that the change *kas > kos
resulted from the need to differentiate between negation and the article.
  Note that there are several particles that are morphologically and semantically related to the
negative particle kas: the negative expression ka:’i ‘no’, which is often used in the same way
as kas; the preclusive particle ka: (cf. 12.5.5); and the prohibitive particle ka’ (cf. 12.5.4).
12.5.2. loy negation of subordinate and relative clauses
The function of the negative particle loy, not to be confused with the homophonous modal
particle loy ‘intentional’ (cf. 12.3.2 above), was already described in 7.15.2. It negates relative
and subordinate clauses. In relative clauses, loy goes together with partial action
nominalization (cf. 11.1.2). This is to say, in negative relative clauses, only monovalent
predicates are converted into action nouns, which are non-relational. In subordinate clauses,
in contrast, the particle loy has no effect on the form of the subordinate predicate.
  Examples (230) and (231) show loy in a relative clause with a bivalent and with a
monovalent predicate, respectively. Note that the bivalent predicate in (230) is not
nominalized, whereas the monovalent predicate in (231), which is a noun, receives the suffix
- e (cf. 11.1):
544

        ‘earrings that are just (of) metal, that are not (of) gold’      {EA, Aros II 055}The following examples illustrate the particle loy in subordinate clauses, which are marked by
the article and action nominalization. Note that the predicate, whether monovalent, as in
(232), or bivalent, as in (233), occurs in the same form that it would have if the clause were
affirmative. In (232), the predicate is a canonical action nominal formed by the suffix -wa (cf.
11.1.1). In (233) and (234), the predicate contains the the nominalizing suffix -na that is
required by the subordinating particle jan ‘CSQ’ (cf. 11.1.3).(232)   n-os        jayna loy            mere’     avo-ni-wa=y’ i       jayna

The particle mo: ‘not yet’ occurs right before the predicate. It indicates that the event has not
occurred at the time of reference, but will, or is expected to, occur later. The time of reference
can be the time of speaking or the time of the narrative context. In (235), the time of reference
is the time of speaking:(235)   bo     rey ney mo: rey           ba:-ra-wa              as     yejcho
        REAS again here yet again finish-BE:ntr-NMZ ART.n month
        ‘Because now the month hasn’t finished yet, you know.’ {Dial. EA&AH 104}
                                                                                              545
In (236), the first ocurrence of mo: refers to the time of speaking within the narrative. The
second ocurrence, which represents part of a comment made by the narrator, refers to the time
of narrative context, in this case the day before the events are narrated:(236)   che    usko       kuro’      mo: joyaj-wa,          jankwa,
        and    PRO.m.a DM.m.a yet arrive-NMZ                say
        bo       mo: joyaj-wa--us
        REAS     yet arrive-NMZ--m.a
        ‘“And he hasn’t arrived yet,” I said, because he hadn’t arrived yet.’ {EA, Visita 040}In (237), the time of reference is in the past:(237)   n-os         kwil     bay im-a=y’ i rey         mo: maj<a’><ni:~>ni
        obl-ART.n.p REM field-LV=1pl again yet my_child<IRR><NMZ.N~>
        ‘When we first had a field, I didn’t have any children yet.’
        {EA, Chaco III 001}The particle mo: triggers partial nominalization (cf. 11.1.2). When the predicate of the
subordinate clause introduced by mo: is monovalent, as in (236), it is converted into a non-
relational noun through the suffixation of -wa or, if it is a noun, through reduplication (cf.
(237)). When the predicate of the subordinate clause is bivalent, however, it remains
unmodified, as illustrated in (238):(238)   aya-ti            bo        mo: lirij-na=‘ne
        wait.DR-IMP.tr REAS         yet shake-DR=f
        ‘Wait because she hasn’t shaken [the tablecloth] yet.’             {EA 19, 146g}Note that partial nominalization of the predicate (cf. 11.1.2) not only occurs with mo: ‘not
yet’, but also with the negative particles loy ‘NEG’ in relative clauses (cf. 12.5.2 above) and
ka’ ‘prohibitive’ (cf. 12.5.4 below).12.5.4. ka’ ‘prohibitive’
The particle ka’ marks the prohibitive construction. It has the same formal properties as mo:
‘not yet’, described above. When the predicate is monovalent, it is nominalized, and when
bivalent, it is not. In (239)–(241), the construction is shown with monovalent, nominalized
predicates:(239)   ka’       na -u’-wa,                ka’        pen-lo -wa

The particle ka: introduces an adverbial clause, i.e., an oblique noun phrase containing a
nominalized predicate (cf. 7.12.3). It indicates that the event described in the adverbial clause
should be prevented. The following examples illustrate the use of this particle:(243)   day-a-ra=n        no-kowa         ban     taw-ka-ra-na=n

before a noun phrase (cf. 12.1.4 above). This is illustrated in (245):(245)   jayna us-che              po:ra,     bo       ka:       n-as  mam~man-wa

12.6.     Interjections
According to Schachter (1985: 58), interjections are “words, often of an exclamatory
character, that can constitute utterances in themselves, and that usually have no syntactic
connection to any other words that may cooccur with them.” In Movima, these include: jo:jo’
‘yes’, ka:’i ‘no’, and chu’ ‘stop it!’. I will illustrate them in turn.
12.6.1. jo:jo’ ‘yes’
This is an affirmative interjection. It can be translated as ‘yes’. However, it is normally not
used as an answer to a question (cf. 7.14), but as a positive reaction to, or a reinforcement of,
the preceding utterance. Example (246) is from a dialogue, and in (247), the speaker
reinforces what she has said before:(246)   A. usko     dis rey        jankwa=n      kempa-kay-a=y’ i
           PRO.m.a OPT again say=2               inform-INV-LV=1pl

        ‘[He] limped, poor guy, as we went to the house, really.’ {Sicurí 092}
12.6.2. ka:’i ‘no’
The particle ka:’i is used to answer questions negatively (cf. 7.14):(248)   Q.    kas rapál-di- e          kós   as-na=n
              NEG red-BE.house-NMZ.N ART.n.a sit-DR=2
              ‘Is your house not red?’        A.    ka:’i, bo           ja’     tavoj-di--as
              no       REAS       just    white-BE.house--n.a
              ‘No, it’s just white.’                                        {EA 8, 045}Sometimes, ka:’i is used in the same way as kas (cf. 12.5.1 above), i.e., in combination with a
nominalized predicate (cf. (249)):(249)   che ka:’i oso’-ni-wa                  os      rim-wanra=y’ i
        and no       DM.n.p-PRC-NMZ           ART.n.p trade-INSTR:BE.ntr=1pl
        ‘And we had no money.’                                     {EA, Vida 020}548
The particle ka:’i is sometimes realized as ka:. Its ending -‘i can probably be analyzed as the
dummy element (cf. 2.9.5). However, I represent this morpheme as monomorphemic, since
the element ka: normally functions as the preclusive particle (cf. 12.5.5 above).
12.6.3. chu’ ‘stop it!’
This exclamation is used to chase away chicken or to tell someone to stop doing something.(250)   chu’,      ka’ tore-na=n as            me:sa

12.7. The filler particle eney
There is one particle used when the speaker does not find the right word: eney. This particle
occurs most often inside an NP, i.e. after the article, and is also found after the relativizer.
Both instances can be found in (252). This is an example in which the speaker looks for a
word of Spanish origin, anteteta:nika ‘anti-tetanus vaccination’.(252)   jayna ya’ e ban-na=is         an is           eney,

  The syntactic status of the word naya’ (cf. (238), (247) above) deserves special discussion.
First of all, while the words based on jan- and e - can be identified as the predicate of
interrogative sentences, since they are followed by an NP, this is not regularly the case with
the word naya’: as can be seen in (247) (cf. also 3.10.6), the verb it is combined with is not
preceded by an article, as is the case with a noun (cf. (238)). Also, it differs in this respect
from the other question words, which are always combined with NPs, even when the NP
contains a verb (cf. (239), (240)). Consequently, naya’ cannot be classified as a typical
content word, functioning as either a predicate or an argument. Its status needs to be
investigated further.
  The word naya’ has one more peculiarity: when combined with an bound pronoun, the
pronoun seems to appear in the obviative form (preceded by k-), a form which usually only
occurs in a transitive construction (cf. 7.5.2 above). This can be seen in (249) and (250). The
simple absential bound pronoun is ungrammatical, as shown in (251).(249)       kiro’    naya’--ki:s,          jankwa             che       ka<ma:~>may

  I will now briefly illustrate the way in which answers are given. A content question is
usually answered by a full clause:(252)       Q. naya’     kus        májniwa=n

12.6), but the repetition of the focalized element of the question (i.e., the predicate or the
element in topic position):183

      This can also be observed in local Spanish: Ya fuiste? – Fui. ‘Did you already go?’ – ‘I went.’                                                                                                            315

7.15.     Negation7.15.1. Main clause negation: kas + NMZ
In a negative main clause, the predicate is preceded by the negative particle kas (cf. 12.5.1).
At the same time, the predicate either contains a negative element, or it is converted into a
relational noun by action nominalization (cf. 11.1). The latter form is identical to that of verbs
in subordinate clauses (cf. 7.12).
   The following are examples of negative clauses with verbal predicates. Example (256)
illustrates a negative intransitive, (257) a negative transitive direct, and (258) a negative
transitive inverse clause. Note that in all cases, the deverbal noun is possessed. This is to say,
the intransitive argument and ARG1 is attached as an internal clitic or, in the case of the first
person singular (cf. (258)), it is implied. Hence, in negative main clauses, we find the same
reversed ergativity split as described for subordinate clauses in 7.12 above.(256)   bo       rey choy        jayna     kas joro-wa=n

and subsequently nominalizing it by the verbal nominalizing suffix -wa. This type of
nominalization creates an unpossessed noun (cf. 11.9.4).(261)   kas rey i’ko-ni-wa               po’so, bo             is     rey po’so ma’nes

the demonstrative is nominalized in the same way as a free pronoun, i.e. by the combination
of -ni ‘PRC’ and -wa ‘NMZ’. The following are examples:(266)    kas jayna         kiro’-ni-wa            kis      o -ka- e-na=i

         {EA, Abuelo 017}A possessive predicate (cf. 7.9.5) is either negated by a demonstrative, as described above, or
by the irrealis marker <a’> (cf. 3.6.2, 10.4), as shown in (268) and (269).184
184
    Note that even though the affirmative and the negative form of the possessive predicate are not
morphologically similar, there is an interesting parallel. Both the formation of the affirmative predicate by
prefixing reduplication (cf. 7.9.5) and that of the negative predicate by infixation of the irrealis marker are
applied according to the first iambic foot of the word (cf. 3.6.2, 3.7.6).","[337, 338, 339, 340, 341]"

10.3.     The irrealis marker <a’> or -RED~-a’
As described in 3.6.2, the irrealis infix <a’>, realized as <ka’> after a vowel, is inserted after
the first iambic foot of the base. It signals irrealis mood in affirmative contexts and participant
negation in negative contexts. As an irrealis marker, it indicates that the speaker considers it
unimportant when exactly the event takes place, but assures that it will take place eventually.
Consider the following examples of the irrealis marker on monovalent verbs:(55)    sal<a’>mo

        {EA, Mi casa 014}As with predicate nominals negated by the irrealis marker (cf. 7.15.1), a periphrasic
construction with a demonstrative predicate can be used as an alternative. This is shown by
(64)b as opposed to a, which contains the irrealis marker.(64)    a. kas       e<na:~>n-a’

then usually apparent from the context. In this case, the irrealis marker implies negation. The
following are examples from a dialogue:(65)    sal<a’>mo-kwa:-na        rey     jayna

        ‘[They] don’t feel pain.’ [lit: “Nothing hurts.”]           {AH, Dial. EA&AH 023}Strikingly, the irrealis marker negates the existence of the participant established by the voice
properties of the base (cf. 8.1). Compare, for example, the irrealis forms in (65)–(66) above
with the corresponding unmarked forms in (68)–(70), respectively. These take an absolutive
argument:(68)    salmo-kwa:-na--sne
        return-BEN-DR--f.a
        ‘I return for her.’ [i.e., for her benefit](69)    suy-kay-a=sne--kus

        ‘He takes (it) away from her.’(70)    tivij-ni--a
        pain-PRC--n
        ‘It hurts.’In a negative clause, a predicate that contains the irrealis marker cannot cooccur with a
pronoun or NP that refers to the participant whose existence is negated. In an affirmative
clause, in contrast, a predicate that contains the irrealis marker can cooccur with the
absolutive argument. Hence, in addition to the presence or absence of the negative particle
kas, the realization of the absolutive argument formally identifies an irrealis-marked verb as
an affirmative predicate. Compare the negative irrealis clause, marked by kas, in (71)a with
the affirmative clause, containing a pronoun that encodes the absolutive argument, in (71)b:440

overtly expressed, their absence is not an unmistakable signal of either the affirmative or the
negative interpretation. The following expression, for example, has two possible
interpretations, depending on the context:(72)    dewaj-a’-na
        see-IRR-DR
        ‘I don’t see anything.’ ~ ‘I’ll see X (sometime).’Morphologically, the irrealis marker behaves slightly differently on verbs with monovalent
and middle roots (cf. 8.3.2 and 8.3.3, respectively). This may have to do with their inherent
valency, but it can also be a purely morphological phenomenon. When the irrealis marker is
attached to verbs with monovalent or middle roots, the voice affix, which is normally attached
to the root, is lost. This is to say, monovalent verbs lose the reflexive/reciprocal marker -che ,
which indicates agentivity of the participant (cf. 8.1.4, 8.3.2), and verbs with middle roots
lose the middle reduplication (cf. 8.3.3). Since only a single iambic element remains, the
irrealis marker is attached as a suffix and then reduplicated (cf. 3.6.2). In (57) and (71) above,
examples of verbs with middle roots were given, which would have the form kay~kay ‘to eat’
(cf. (57)) and de<ja:~>jal ‘to cook’ (cf. (71)) if not marked as irrealis. The following
examples are of irrealis-marked verbs with a monovalent root, which take the
reflexive/reciprocal suffix -che when not marked as irrealis. The verb in jo<ya:~>y-a’ in
(73) would appear as joy-che ‘go’ if not marked as irrealis; the verb de<ka:~>-ka’ in (74)
would appear as de:-che ‘lie’. An example involving the verb en-che ‘to stand’ was seen in
(64) above.(73)    i’ne   jo<ya:~>y-a’       n-as        leve-na-wa=‘ne

voice marker -na, which, on these roots, indicates that the undergoer is a location, the voice
marker is retained. This is the same type of marking as on verbs containing a bivalent root and                                                                                              441

10.4.       -na:na’ ‘pseudo’
The suffix -na:na’ can occur on nouns as well as on verbs. It is not very productive and often
lexicalized together with the root.243
  On nouns, the suffixation of -na:na’ indicates that the denoted entity is reminiscent of the
entity denoted by the nominal base, but not identical with it. Therefore, I adopt the gloss
‘pseudo’ from Judy & Judy (1967). The examples in (78) illustrate this meaning:(78)     pa:ko-na:na’   ‘fox’ (dog-PSEU)
         kodosi-na:na’  ‘artificial duck (e.g. of plastic)’ (duck-PSEU)
         sapa’mo-na:na’ ‘small calabash’ (SP. tutumillo) (calabash-PSEU)Likewise, on verbs, the suffix -na:na’ indicates that the action denoted by the verb root is
only pretended. The suffix is attached to monovalent roots or bases only, and the resulting
verb is monovalent.(79)     dejal-na:na’ is            dichi:ye
         cook-PSEU       ART.pl child
         ‘The children pretend to be cooking.’ [i.e., playing; without really cooking]

         ‘to be running without being able to’, ‘to run slowly’                     {JM 18, 083b}243
   This suffix is apparently the result of CV-reduplication of the segment /nak/. However, the only examples that
may show an unreduplicated morpheme -na’ are tomi:-na’ ‘wet season’ (water-?) and ita:-na’ ‘white person’
(?-?).","[459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465]"

illustrated, and under b, a word is given to illustrate normal incorporation of a bound nominal

that it has a nominal origin, too.
  While it is sometimes difficult to isolate the meaning of the root in these verbs, it is clearly
the case that predicates with -baycho in affirmative contexts denote some kind of mental state
or psychological property. This can be seen in (107) and (108) above, as well as in (110)–
(112) below:(110)   dom-baycho     us        dotor

are also worth mentioning. These are pabaycho ‘think’ (cf. (113)) and to’baycho ‘remember’
(cf. (114)) These can be considered lexicalized, since their roots are not productively
combined with other morphemes.(113)   di:ran joy choy          pa:baycho      is         juyeni,     avo-ka-baycho

Since all these words involve, to some degree, a mental activity or state, the suffix -baycho in
these cases can be considered identical to -baycho in negative contexts, where it also indicates
a (more specific) state of mind.
  Note, however, that there is one formal difference between predicates containing -baycho in
affirmative and in negative clauses. In affirmative use, the suffix -baycho creates a predicate
whose argument is absolutive, as expected of monovalent predicates. This could be seen, for
example, in (108) and (114), where the first person singular is encoded by the bound pronoun
of Set 2, in.247 In contrast, in negative contexts, the derived predicate has an internally
cliticized argument (cf. (101)–(106)). No explanation for this contrast in person encoding can
be given at this point.","[469, 470, 471, 472]"

In yet another example, future tense is indicated by the adverbial clause nas tawa’ni
‘tomorrow’:(213)   n-as       tawa’-ni         joy-che kos           aviyon [...]
        obl-ART.n next_day-PRC go-R/R ART.n.a plane

        ‘Tomorrow the plane will leave [...] which (will) take the beef over there to El Perú.’
        {EA, Cbba 213}In all these cases, the form kwey clearly represents the focus marker (kaw), since its use as a
past-tense marker is ruled out by the context.
  In order to focus on an argument and to indicate immediate past tense in the same clause,
kaw and kwey can cooccur. This is shown in (214) and (215) below. In (214), the particles can
be distinguished by their position. The clause-initial particle is the one that indicates past
tense, while the particle following the free pronoun is the focus marker kaw, in accordance
with the analysis of (206) and (207) above:(214)   kwey u’ko        kwey puru’-na        n-i’ne
        IMM PRO.m FOC kiss-DR                 obl-PRO.f

The focus particle is in place after the free pronoun.(215)   in a       kwey sal-na  kweyka
        PRO.1sg FOC search-DR IMM
        ‘I just looked for it.’                                              {ER 11, 015b}Example (216) even shows adjacent cooccurrence of the focus marker kaw, realized as [kaw],
and the tense particle kwey:(216)   i’ne    kwey kaw        dewaj-na      nu-kus      itila:kwa
        PRO.f IMM FOC see-DR                  obl-ART.m.a man
        ‘She has seen the man right now.’                                     {EA 7, 057k}Thus, the particles kaw can usually be clearly distinguished from kwey, even though the two
are often homophonous.
  However, there are also cases in which the distinction between the two particles is difficult
to draw, and where a more detailed analysis is needed. This is especially the case when kwey
occurs inside a noun phrase that contains a verb, as in (217):(217)   jayna    kas oso’-ni-wa            os          kwey      sal-na
        DSC      NEG DM.n.p-PRC-NMZ ART.n.p FOC                  search-DR

In this example, the particle inside the NP can be identified as the focus particle kaw. This is
because the referent of the NP that contains a direct transitive verb, salna ‘search’, is not the
undergoer, as would be predicted from the voice marker -na (cf. 8.1.1, 8.2), but the actor. This
is the typical effect of the focus particle kaw, which demotes the former ARG2 from the
clausal core (cf. 7.8). If the focus particle were absent, or if the form kwey were the tense
marker, then the NP in (217) would denote the undergoer of the event, and the translation of
the clause would be ‘the (thing) I looked for was not there anymore’.
  Example (218) is similar to (217) above. Here, the fact that the particle inside the NP is
realized as kaw serves as evidence that it is the focus marker and not the tense particle:(218)   ka:w-e            is             kaw     ji:-ba:-na
        much-BE.person ART.pl            FOC     cry-BR.round-DR

an NP rather seems to be the tense particle. For example, in (219) below, the referent of the
NP containing a direct bivalent verb is the undergoer. The presence of the element kwey does
not have the effect of demoting the argument denoting the undergoer, as it does in (217) and
(218) above. Therefore, it probably represents the past-tense particle kwey.(219)   i:ri        i:          ney is        kwey dej-na di’ n-i’ne

12.5.      Negative particles
Negation in Movima is expressed by particles, usually in combination with a morphological
modification of the predicate. In most cases, the predicate either contains a negative marker
(e.g. the irrealis infix <a’>), or it is nominalized. The negative particles, and the types of
predicates or clauses they occur with, are listed in (220):(220)   kas      ‘not’               +    nominalized or negative predicate

  Since not only verbs, but also nouns can function as the predicate of an affirmative main
clause (cf. 7.9), action nominalization applies to nouns as well. However, when turned into an
action noun, a predicate nominal undergoes a different morphological process than a verbal
predicate. It undergoes infixing reduplication, or it receives a suffix - e. I will first describe
nominalization by reduplication. In (7) and (8), adverbial clauses with predicate nominals are
shown:254(7)      n-asko       rey    tolkos<ya~>ya=sne

         ‘It’s not a wrecked motorbike anymore.’ [i.e., it has been repaired] {EA, Moto 006}When a possessive predicate, formed by prefixing foot reduplication of a noun (cf. 3.7.6,
7.9.5) occurs in a subordinate or negative clause, it undergoes infixing reduplication as well.
The resulting word then contains two reduplicated elements, as shown in (10) and (11). The
fact that these predicates are reduplicated, like nouns, and do not nominalized through the
suffix -wa, like verbs, is a sign that morphologically, possessive predicates are nouns.","[491, 492]"

7.5.3. The ergativity split in affirmative main clauses
The hierarchical alignment system in Movima creates a split-ergative pattern. This becomes
apparent when an intransitive clause is compared with the direct and the inverse construction,
respectively. In both the direct and the inverse pattern, ARG2 has the same formal properties
as ARGintr, as was described in 7.2 above. As far as affirmative main clauses are concerned,
when the intransitive construction is compared with the direct transitive construction, this
results in an ergative pattern, since ARG2 is the most patient-like participant (the undergoer).
When it is compared with the inverse construction, in contrast, we see an accusative
alignment pattern, since ARG2 is the most agent-like participant (the actor).162 This is
schematized in Table 23:Table 23. The ergativity split in affirmative main clauses163

Relative clauses and subordinate clauses that involve nominalization are negated differently
from main clauses. Instead of kas ‘NEG’, the negative particle here is loy ‘NEG.SUB’. The
subordinate predicate is only modified under certain circumstances, depending on the
construction and on its valency.
  When the particle loy occurs in a transitive relative clause, the predicate remains
unmodified:(272)     jo’yaj kos        juyeni di’ loy           ona-ye-na=i
          arrive ART.n.a person REL NEG.SUB know-BE.person-DR=pl
          ‘Some person arrives who they don’t know.’             {HR, TX 127}In an intransitive relative clause, the predicate is nominalized in the same way as a negated
main-clause predicate (cf. 7.15.1), as shown in (273). In contrast to negative main clauses,
however, the nominalized form is unpossessed.186(273)     n-os           teres-cho          ela-na=is

          ‘In the middle they left a branch that wasn’t smeared.’                     {EA, Parabas 020}185
    In the same way as the article, the negative particle kas can be combined with the marker of first person, (cf.
12.5.1).
186
     The same phenomenon occurs in connection with the particles mo: ‘yet’ and ka’ ‘PRCL’ (cf. 12.5.)                                                                                                              319
A subordinate clause with a nominalized predicate is negated by the particle loy occurring
inside the NP, i.e., between the article and the action noun that represents the predicate. The

7      Clause and sentence structureIn this chapter, the most important aspects of simple and complex sentences in Movima are
described. Before going into details in the following sections, I want to point out some crucial
properties of Movima clause structure.
  First of all, Movima has a hierarchical alignment system. There is no case marking and no
agreement indicating grammatical relations. Word order is fixed, but it is semantically
determined: in a transitive clause, the participant higher in the animacy hierarchy is encoded
as the first core argument (ARG1) and the participant lower in the hierarchy is encoded as the
second core argument (ARG2). The semantic roles of the arguments are indicated by direct or
inverse voice marking on the verb, as described in 7.5. An effect of this system is an
ergativity split, since the alignment of grammatical relations and semantic roles is switched by
the voice markers (cf. 7.5.3).
  The fact that due to the hierarchical alignment system, grammatical relations are not
distinguished by case marking, agreement, or word order, makes it difficult to attach labels
such as “subject” and “object” to the syntactic positions. J. Judy (1965) uses these terms,
labelling the first argument in a transitive clause “subject” and the second argument “object”.
This, however, is a problem in inverse clauses, where, as Judy also points out, the second
argument encodes the agent.
  Moreover, it can be shown that if anything can be analysed as the subject in Movima, this is
not the first, but the second core argument, which represents the undergoer in a direct
transitive clause. This becomes apparent from the structure of relative clauses, described in
7.11. In addition, the second, but not the first core argument can be deleted in coordination,
which is also a criterion for subjecthood (cf. Keenan 1976). However, it may be misleading to
use the term “subject” for the second transitive argument, since it has some untypical
properties. In the direct construction, which can be seen as pragmatically less marked since it
indicates that the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy acts on the participant lower on
the hierarchy, the second argument encodes the undergoer. Also, this argument is not
obligatorily realized. To avoid confusion, I use the neutral terms ARGintr for the intransitive
argument, ARG1 for the first transitive argument, and ARG2 for the second transitive
argument. ARGintr and ARG2 are furthermore subsumed under the term “absolutive
argument”.
  Note, furthermore, that ARG1, the first argument in a transitive clause, is encoded in the
same way as the possessor (cf. 6.1).134
  This chapter is organized as follows. Sections 7.1–7.8 discuss constituent order, argument
encoding, and the assignment of semantic roles in affirmative main clauses. In Sections 7.9–
7.10, I describe affirmative main clauses with nonverbal predicates, as well as arguments that
contain a verb. In Section 7.11, relative clauses are described. Section 7.12 presents the main134
    The peculiarities of the Movima system outlined here may arise from the possibility that, at least historically,
all clauses are basically equational. Under this view, ARG1 represents a possessor, and the absolutive argument
represents the intransitive subject everywhere. This means that the proposition ‘I hit the dog’ would in Movima
be expressed as ‘my hitten one is the dog’. The term “subject” would be uncontroversial then. For an analysis of
other languages along these lines, see Sasse 1991.","[279, 280]"

with an open first syllable, this syllable is long due to prosodic factors (cf. 2.8.2). This
prosodic lengthening can be taken into account for reduplication or not. The word ro:ya
‘house’, for example, can be marked for predicative possession in two ways:(96)    a. ro:~ro:ya        ~       b. roya~ro:ya
           POSS~house                  POSS~house
           ‘to own a house’In contrast, words whose first syllable is always long, e.g. disyllabic loans (cf. 2.9.2), do not
permit this variation, since the first syllable is inherently heavy. This is the case with the word
wa:ka ‘cow’ (cf. (95)b above), which cannot undergo disyllabic reduplication:(97)    * waka~wa:ka
          POSS~cow
          (‘to own cows’)Prefixing reduplication marking a possessive predicate can cooccur with infixing
reduplication. In (98), an example is given of a possessive predicate formed of a noun marked
for inalienable possession (cf. 3.7.5). It is structured as follows. In (98)a, the noun charayelo
‘honey’ is marked by infixing reduplication for inalienable possession, as in (92) and (93)a
above, with the possessor expressed by an internally cliticized bound pronoun. In (98)b, the
same noun is marked as a possessive predicate by prefixing foot reduplication; its argument is
expressed by the externally cliticized bound pronoun (cf. 3.9.2, 7.9.1). In (98)c, finally, the
two reduplicative processes occur on the same base: the inalienably possessed noun in (98)a is
marked by prefixing foot reduplication, as in (98)b, as a possessive predicate in a relative
clause.(98)    a. charaye<lo~>lo=is
           syrup-<INAL~>BR.liquid=pl.a
           ‘their honey (of the bees)’        b. chara~charaye:-lo--is
           POSS~syrup-BR.liquid--pl.a
           ‘They have honey.’ [lit.: “They are honey-owners.”]        c. is        chuydi di’ chara~charaye-<lo:~>lo

           ‘bees which have (their) honey’ [lit.: “which are honey-owners”] {JM 17, 278}Another case in which both types of reduplication cooccur is when a possessive predicate
occurs in a subordinate or negative clause (cf. (99)a and b, respectively). Here, the noun with
the foot reduplication undergoes additional infixing reduplication (cf. 3.7.4):
                                                                                                91

possessive predicate formed by the irrealis marker -a’ on nouns (cf. 3.6.2):(100)   kas    chara<ka’>ye-lo=i

determined by the first iambic foot of the base, as is the position of the irrealis marker. It is
striking that these morphological processes, which are related in meaning but formally quite
distinct, are influenced by the same prosodic feature of the base.","[113, 114, 115]"

Canonical action nominalization creates a noun that constitutes the predicate of a canonical
subordinate clause (cf. 7.12 ) or of a clause containing the negative particle kas (cf. 7.15.1).
As was discussed in 7.12.1, the noun that is created through action nominalization is
relational, i.e., obligatorily possessed. The only exception to this concerns nominalized forms
that are first verbalized through -ni ‘PRC’, to be discussed in 11.9.4 below.
  In (1)–(3), examples are given in which the predicate contains the suffix -wa. As can be
seen, the predicate is preceded by an article, together with which it constitutes an NP. In (1),
the action nominal253 represents the absolutive argument of a transitive clause. In (2), it is the
predicate of a purposive clause, introduced by the particle bo (cf. 12.1.4). In (3), the action
nominal forms a temporal adverbial clause (cf. 7.12.3).(1)     ji:-poj-kay      as     chukul-ni-wa=as                  woro’

-ka can equally add the immediative or the impossibilitive meaning. The impossibilitive, if
not apparent from the context, is then indicated by the presence of the particle kas. The
following examples illustrate this for the middle root am- ‘bathe’. In (19)a, the suffix -ka has
the immediative function, since there is no indication of a negative context. In (19)b, the
negative particle kas marks the clause as negative, so that the suffix -ka is interpreted as
indicating the impossibility of the event.(19)    a.    am-ka -a=a          kwey no-kos             ima:yoj

“immediately” (cf. (21)a); in a negative context, it is interpreted as bivalent (cf. (21)b):(21)    a. am-ka -a=as                         b. kas am-ka -a=a
           enter-IM-LV=n.a                        NEG enter-IM-LV=n
           ‘It came in at once.’ {EA, Cbba 095}   ‘It can’t be put in.’ {EA 19, 094b}
                                                                                             431
The impossibilitive function of the morpheme -ka has a semantic counterpart, the morpheme
-nira ‘potential’, which is described in the next section.
10.1.4. -nira ‘potential’
The suffix -nira is rare. It seems to be composed of the verbalizing suffix -ni and the
semantically empty bound nominal element -ra ‘BE.ntr’. The resulting word is a
morphological noun. It indicates that the event denoted by the verb root has the potential to
occur. The following examples illustrate this suffix on a bivalent and a monovalent root,
respectively:(22)    loj-ni:ra a’ko
        wash-POT PRO.n
        ‘It can be washed; it’s washable’                                    {JM 17, 050a}(23)     am-ni:ra      as       pa:ko
        bathe-POT ART.n dog
        ‘The dog lets itself be bathed / can be bathed.’                   {EC, 17, 072d}The following two text examples also contain this suffix:(24)    jayna     chon-lo:maj     ruj-ka-baycho-ni:ra     jayna
        DSC       right-BE.time ruin-MLT-MST-POT DSC
        n-as           joy-wa=is      majniwa=n
        obl-ART.n go-NMZ=pl.a child_of=2
        ‘Then really it makes you sad when your children leave.’           {EA, Lonely 012}(25)    mo: joro-kay-a=‘ne choy              rey, mo: joro-ni:ra
        yet sleep-INV-LV=f certainly again yet sleep-POT
        ‘[The noise] didn’t let her sleep, of course, (it is something which) doesn’t let one
        sleep.’                                                      {EA, Alojamiento 007}(26)    josi-pa-ni:ra       as      ja’ baw-ka-pa-n-e -wa
        laugh-APPL-POT ART.n just exchange-MLT-TRC.hand?-LN-APPL-NMZ
        ‘It makes one laugh to be exchanging arguments.’   {HR 14, 148c}In a negative clause, a verb with -nira is negated like a predicate nominal, i.e., by infixing
reduplication (cf. 7.15, 11.1.1). When negated, the function of -nira is identical to that of -ka
on unmarked bivalent roots: it indicates that the event denoted by the verb root cannot occur.
Consider the following examples:
432
(27)      a. kas am-ka -a=‘ne           bo          tera:ni   ja’
             NEG bathe-IM-LV=f          REAS        ill       just        ~ b. kas am-ni<ra~>da=‘ne            bo         tera:ni
             NEG bathe-POT<NMZ.N~>=f REAS               ill
             ‘She cannot be bathed because she is ill.’                     {JM 17, 304}(28)      a. kas ra -ka -a=a
             NEG tear-IM-LV=n        ~ b. kas ra -ni<ra~>da=a
             NEG tear-POT<NMZ.N~>=n
             ‘You can’t tear it [the plant] out.’                           {JM 17, 075a}
10.2.       -ka and kaka ‘multiple event’10.2.1. The suffix -ka
The suffix -ka occurs on verbal bases which either contain the verbalizing suffix -ni (cf. 11.9)
or an incorporated modifier (cf. 9.2). It comes directly after the verb root; on synchronically
unanalysable bases, it is inserted as an infix (cf. 3.6.1). The marker -ka indicates that the
situation denoted by the verbal base occurs repeatedly. This can concern any type of situation,
i.e., states, events, processes or actions.
   In (29)a, the absence of the suffix -ka implies that the resultative state denoted by the verb
occurs only once, whereas in (29)b, the presence of -ka indicates that there are several
instances of the state:(29)      a. yam-pin        as      do’ewa:noj
             fold-BE.half ART.n cloth
             ‘The cloth is folded (once).’          b. yan-ka:-pin          as      do’ewa:noj
             fold-MLT-BE.half ART.n cloth
             ‘The cloth is folded up (several times).’                           {EA 7, 100}The multiple occurrence of an event as indicated by -ka is independent of the number of
participants. It can either imply “event number” Corbett (2000: 246f.), as in (29)a, where one
single participant is involved in several instances of the same situation type. It can also imply
“participant number” (cf. ibid), i.e., that each one of several participants is involved in the
same situation once. In Movima, these two types can only be distinguished, if at all, by the
number marking of the referential element. Examples (30)–(32) illustrate -ka as a marker of
“event number”. Here, one single participant, referred to by a singular NP or pronoun, is
involved in several instances of the same type of situation:                                                                                             433

         ‘The caiman was still moving.’                                           {EG, Sicurí 083}(31)     kowa        da’        lirij-ka-mo:-che

         ‘I’m falling asleep all the time.’                                       {EC 10, 168b}In the following example, the presence of plural referential elements indicates that all
participants are involved in the same stative situation:(33)     dewaj-na kis         nuy-ka-vus-e -kwinto                     day-ka-chorada:-ne
         see-DR ART.pl.a get_dirty-MLT-BR.dust-APPL-cheek lie-MLT-street-APPL
         ‘I see (people with) dirty cheeks lying around on the street.’
         {AH, EA&AH 108a}When the verbal base denotes an irreversible event, such as ‘explode’ (cf. (34)) or ‘die’ (cf.
(35)), the attachment of -ka automatically implies that several participants are involved:(34)     jayna n-as         love -ni-wa=is,           jayna      pikpikpikpik241
         DSC obl-ART.n cooked-PRC-NMZ=pl.a DSC                   ONOM
         jayna ra -ka-<cho:~>cho               kis      mo~mo -a=is
         DSC tear-MLT-<MD~>BR.inside ART.pl.a RED~BR.shell-DR=pl.a
         ‘Then, when they are cooked, they go “pikpikpikpik”, their shells burst.’
         {EA, Lo’im 028}(35)     kay<ka:>ni
         die<MLT>
         ‘to die one ofter the other [e.g. cattle]’                                 {EA 14, 227a}The above examples were of monovalent predicates. The following examples illustrate the
occurrence of -ka on bivalent predicates. Here as well, the addition of -ka can either imply
that the same participant is involved in the event repeatedly or that several participants are
involved in the same event. In the latter case, this concerns the participant that is represented
as ARG2.","[453, 454, 455, 456, 457]"

Acknowledgements
Many people have helped me get this work done. First and foremost, my gratitude goes to
Pieter Muysken, who has made this project possible by hosting it within his Spinoza
programme “Lexicon and Syntax” at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Not only did I
benefit from his insightful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript, which were always
to the point and opened new lines of thought for me. He also gave me the feeling that
whatever problem there would be on the way, he would try to help out. Whenever I
approached him for linguistic or non-linguistic advice, I got an open ear, no matter whether it
was the right moment or not. His confidence in this project and his constant encouragement
were an enormous support.
   I was also very lucky in that during the entire project, I had Rik van Gijn as my office mate.
This meant lots of fun, discussions, and the possibility to exchange experiences on life in the
linguistic world. My work has benefited greatly from Rik’s insights and from his talent to
present things systematically.
   Hein van der Voort, occasional office mate, advised me in many ways. In particular, I am
very grateful for his extremely detailed, critical and helpful comments on the entire
manuscript.
   I owe many thanks to Mily Crevels, who has helped me a lot especially at the beginning of
this project. In particular, Mily accompanied me to Santa Ana in 2001, and through her I got
acquainted with the people who became my closest friends there. With respect to field work
and dealing with practical matters in the Beni, Mily gave me the most valuable advice.
   Outside the Spinoza group, I want to thank the following linguists for commenting on
earlier drafts of specific chapters of this book, for discussing the data with me, and/or for
advising me on particular topics: Willem Adelaar, Martin Böhler, Werner Drossard, Dan
Everett, Mats Exter, Ad Foolen, Colette Grinevald, Carlos Gussenhoven, Birgit Hellwig,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, Helen de Hoop, Haike Jacobs, Leonid Kulikov, Geraldine Legendre,
Andrej Malchukov, Maarten Mous, Doris Payne, Hans-Jürgen Sasse, René Schiering, Anna
Siewierska, Leon Stassen, and Fernando Zúñiga. I am especially grateful to Werner Drossard,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, and Hans-Jürgen Sasse for the long and inspiring discussions on the
Movima voice and valency system, whose essence I would probably never have understood
otherwise. My particular gratitude also goes to Willem Adelaar and Carlos Gussenhoven for
discussing earlier versions of the phonology chapter with me, and for their patience in
answering my numerous questions on the topic. In addition, I am deeply indebted to Willem
Adelaar for his valuable comments on the entire manuscript. And Maarten Mous is especially
thanked for sitting with me for hours when I was desperate and did not know how this work
could ever come to an end.
   Pilar Valenzuela is acknowledged for pointing out Movima to me as a possible language of
research.
   I furthermore want to thank the participants of the Americanist Colloquium in Nijmegen for
their comments on my talks, in particular Jürgen Bohnemeyer, Swintha Danielsen, Martina
Faller, Rafael Fischer, Jesus Mario Girón, Katja Hanss, Roland Hemmauer, Sergio Meira,
Loretta O’Connor, and Frank Seifart. And without the critical questions from the participants
of my “Strukturkurs Movima” at the Linguistics Department in Cologne, some problems and
contradictions in my analyses would hardly ever have become apparent to me.                                                                                                i
   While it was not possible to integrate into the present work all the comments I got, they
highly increased my insight into the Movima grammar.
   My research has also benefited greatly from the open and friendly atmosphere at the
Linguistics Department of the Radboud University in Nijmegen. My thanks go particularly to
Helen de Hoop, Monique Lamers, Peter de Swart, Andrej Malchukov, Joost Zwarts, Wilske
Driessen, Janine van der Zijl, Else Havik, Margot van den Berg, and Marleen van de Vate.
   It is hard to express my gratitude adequately to the Movima speakers who contributed the
data on which this grammar is based. Their hospitality and their willingness to teach me their
language were overwhelming.
   First of all, I want to thank Esaltación Amblo Ovales, who took upon herself the task of
teaching me Movima. She is the best teacher I could have imagined, with her clarity of
pronunciation, her great memory, and her readiness to talk to me in Movima about all kinds of
topics. I am also grateful to her sister Etelvina and her cousin Modesta for receiving me in
their house with so much friendliness.
   My thanks go furthermore to Julia Malale Humasa, my principal teacher during my first and
my last stay. Good-humoured and funny, yet serious when it came to analysing her language,
she is a delightful instructor.
   I owe many thanks to Eligardo Chirimani Malue for working with me every day right from
the beginning. Without his linguistic insight and his careful judgment, it would never have
been possible to create such a large and useful text database. Apart from that, it is mainly due
to the fact that he and Melvin Rossel Yoqui took so much interest in maintaining their native
language that this research was carried out at all. The other members of the Subcentral
Indígena Movima are also acknowledged for supporting this project throughout.
   I am furthermore grateful to Griselda Cáumol, Balvina Almaquio, Herlan Rojas, Ela Rossel,
Nelly Gualusna, Peregrina Cayú, Dora Vargas, Delmira Masaro, Nataniel Cáumol, Eleuterio
Mole, Alejandro Yónima, Juan Hualima, Bernarda Gualusna, María Esaltación Sepi, and Luis
Yalauma for teaching me their language.
   Most of my teachers I would never have met without the help of Janeth Cayalo. She took
me with her on her motorbike every day during the beginning of my field work to find
consultants. I am deeply grateful to her.
   This leads me to other friends in Santa Ana without whom my stays there would have been
much less effective and pleasant. Elsita Asbún, Esperanza Cayalo, Sonia Rivero, and Graciela
Rodríguez helped me in all aspects of daily life and became dear friends. Olga Arteaga and
her family provided a home for me for most the time, and their parrot was my most faithful
companion and probably the only one who learned words from me. I am also indebted to
Milton Villavicencio and his wife Loida for their great hospitality.
   Outside Santa Ana, I especially want to thank Dr. Carlos Patiño Kühn in Santa Cruz for
taking my health worries off my back. Gudrun Birk is thanked for digging with me in the
APCOB library.
   Last but not least, I want to thank my parents for their strong support at all times. My
friends in Cologne took up with my unusual lifestyle with much understanding. And my
deepest gratitude is with Harald Stoffels, who accompanied me towards and throughout this
entire project, and who is the main responsible for the fact that the years of thesis writing
were very happy years.

While all predicate nominals can be reduplicated in order to function as the predicate of a
negative or subordinate clause, the suffix - e has a more limited distribution. First of all, the
form with - e occurs more often in negative than in subordinate clauses. The following
example illustrates this. In (16)a, the adjective tochi’ ‘small’ occurs in a negative clause with
the suffix - e. In (16)b, it is shown that in a subordinate clause, this suffix cannot be used.
Rather, the reduplicated form has to be used, as shown by (16)c (cf. also (8) above).(16)    a. kas     tochi'- e
           NEG small-NMZ.N
           ‘I am not small.’                                                        {JM 16, 253a}        b. * n-os         tochi’- e,          asko       bijaw-ni:-na

           obl-ART.n.p small<NMZ.N~> PRO.n.a old-PRC-DR
           ‘When I was small, that (was where) I grew up.’                          {JM 16, 253b}Furthermore, nominalization through - e is very common on adjectives, while more
prototypical nouns are only rarely found with this suffix (cf. 3.10.4.3). The only text example
of a noun with the suffix - e in a negative clause is given in (17):(17)    jayna kas        don-’i- e=os       chi:~chi
        DSC NEG blood-D-NMZ.N=n.p MD~go_out
        ‘It wasn’t blood anymore what came out.’                                   {EA, Cbba 159}The reason why in (17), the predicate nominal don’i ‘blood’ is marked by - e and not by
reduplication, may be that when reduplicated, the word would be homophonous with the
inalienably possessed form. Recall from 3.7.5 and 6.4.1 that like action nominalization,
inalienable possession is marked by infixing reduplication. This is illustrated in (18) for the
same word as in (17) above. The sentence in (18) is the one which follows (17) in the
narration.(18)    ba:-ra          jayna     os         don-<‘i:~>‘i        jayna
        finish-BE.ntr DSC         ART.n.p blood-<INAL~>D DSC
        ‘I had lost all my blood.’ [lit: “My blood was finished.”] {EA, Cbba 160}In this particular context, it is possible that the suffix - e is used in (17) in order to distinguish
the negated predicate nominal from the inalienably possessed noun in (18). However, it can
still be concluded that adjectives are more often combined with the suffix - e than nouns,
especially in negative clauses, so that the tendency to use - e on adjectives can be seen as a
distinction between the two word classes.
   Before concluding the present section, I will briefly discuss verbs that contain the ending
-wa, but where this element does not have a nominalizing function. Examples include                                                                                                 471
tivijni:wa ‘feel pain’ (cf. (19)) and chajani:wa ‘be ashamed’ (cf. (20)):(19)    jayna     tivijni:wa--sne    n-os         ari=sne
        DSC       feel_pain--f.a     obl-ART.n.p leg=f.a
        ‘She had already pain in her leg.’                          {EA, Lagartija 031}(20)    jayna n-as         ena’        kaw-<we~>we=is                          juyeni

        ‘When there are many people when theyi go out [onto the stage], theyi are ashamed.’
        {EA, Tolkosya I 028}When these verbs are nominalized, the nominalizing suffix -wa is attached. This shows that
-wa in (19) and (20) above is not the nominalizing suffix, but part of the verbal base.(21)    n-as       tivijniwa-wa=i
        obl-ART.n feel_pain-NMZ=pl
        ‘when they have pain’                                   {AH, EA&AH 023}(22)    kas     chajaniwa:-wa         n-in a       n-as     je’e
        NEG be_ashamed-NMZ            obl-PRO.1sg obl-ART.n state_of
        ‘I am not ashamed of myself, of how I am.’         {HR, TX 088}While the verb chajaniwa ‘be ashamed’ (cf. (20)) always occurs with the ending -wa, there is
also a verb tivijni ‘hurt’, derived from the noun ti:vij ‘pain’, which does not contain the
ending -wa. Here, a difference in meaning can be observed: the argument of the verb tivijni
‘hurt’ expresses the body part which hurts, whereas the argument of the verb tivijni:wa ‘feel
pain’ expresses the person or animal that feels pain. Compare (24) below, which contains the
nominalized form of the verb tivijni ‘hurt’, with (19) above, which contains the verb tivijni:wa
‘feel pain’. Apart from the difference in meaning, ‘hurt’ versus ‘feel pain’, the form in (24) is
a relational noun, while the one in (19) above is a monovalent verb.(23)    tivij-ni    as    bari=‘ne
        pain-PRC ART.n foot=f
        ‘Her foot hurts.’                                                   {EA, Dialogue 020}(24)    asko      n-os          jayna       tivij-ni-wa=os       dimpoj-a=sne
        PRO.n.a obl-ART.n.p DSC             pain-PRC-NMZ=ART.n.p toe-LV=f.a
        ‘That was when her toe hurt.’                          {EA, Lagartija 021}  Thus, there is a suffix -wa, homophonous with the nominalizer, which has an applicative
function, raising a new participant to argument function. However, this suffix does not seem
to be productive, since only these two examples were found.","[493, 494, 495]"

10 Modal and aspectual morphologyThis chapter describes morphemes, most of them verbal affixes, that in principle do not
influence the valency of the verb to which they are attached. While its is a very heterogeneous
group, most of these morphemes can be described as having an aspectual or a modal function.
  The suffix -ka (cf. 10.1), which shares some morphological properties with nominalizing
morphemes (cf. 11.1), can be seen as an aspectual suffix. It has different functions, depending
on the type of base to which it is attached. On derivational bases with specified semantic
valency (cf. 8.7), it indicates that the action is carried out immediately or earlier than normal.
On inherently monovalent roots, which normally do not serve as derivational bases, -ka
indicates that the action cannot be carried out. In this last function, -ka is related to another
suffix, -nira (cf. 10.1.4), which, when negated, also indicates an impossibility.
  The marker -ka ‘multiple event’ (cf. 10.2.1) indicates that there are several occurrences of
the same situation. This affix is inserted after the root on morphologically complex bases.
There is an apparently related fossilized morpheme kaka (cf. 10.2.2), which occurs in
restricted contexts and can also function as a root.
  The irrealis infix <a’>, with the base-final allomorph -RED~a’, (cf. 10.3) is a modal
morpheme. In affirmative contexts, it indicates that the situation will occur at some
unspecified moment in the future. In negative contexts, it indicates the non-existence of the
absolutive participant. In this function, <a’> is also found on nouns. Its morphological
properties were described in detail in 3.6.2.
  The suffix -na:na’, for which I adopt Judy & Judy’s (1967) term ‘pseudo’, can also occur
on nominal as well as on verbal bases. This suffix is rare, and I will only give a few examples
in 10.4.
  Section 10.5 focuses on the modal suffixes -sicha’kwa ‘desiderative’ and -baycho ‘mental
state’, which usually indicate mental inclinations of the participant. While creating
morphological nouns, the words with these suffixes usually function as monovalent
predicates.
  The intensifying suffix with its two allomorphs, -u’ and -ay’ (cf. 10.6), occurs directly on
the verb root, which is then followed by eventual further morphemes and by voice markers. A
homophonous morpheme also occurs on phasal verbs, described in 10.7.
  Section 10.7 describes a complex process by which phasal aspect is expressed. A root or
base is attached to a “phasal” verb root, and according to the inherent valency of the
incorporated base, either the suffix -u’/-ay’ or the suffix -kaka is attached.
10.1.     -ka ‘immediative’ / ‘impossibilitive’ and -ni:ra ‘potential’
In this section, two semantically related suffixes are presented. They can be described as
indicating an external circumstance of the event denoted by the verb. The suffix -ka ,
described in 10.1.1–10.1.3, indicates that an action or state is carried out or starts earlier than
usual, or that it cannot be carried out. These two interpretations are determined by the base to
which the suffix is attached. The suffix -nira 10.1.4 indicates that a state or event has the
                                                                                               425
potential to take place. When a verb with this suffix is negated, it has the same meaning as a
verb on which -ka indicates the impossibility of an event to occur.
  Before discussing the semantic properties of these suffixes in more detail, I will describe the
specific morphological characteristics of the suffix -ka .","[445, 446, 447, 448, 449]"

1.10. The organization of this book
The organization of this book is as follows. Chapter 2 describes the phonological and
morphophonological properties of the language. In the section on intonation, the difference
between declarative and interrogative sentences is explained.
  In the first part of Chapter 3, the different morphological units and processes are introduced,
including the different kinds of cliticization by which the grammatical relations are
distinguished. The second part of this chapter provides an overview of the parts of speech in
Movima, paying special attention to the status of adjectives.
  The morphological, semantic, and pragmatic properties of the different types of referential
elements, which play a central role in the grammar of Movima, are described in Ch. 4.
  Chapters 5 and 6 deal with noun morphology. In Ch. 5, independent nouns, compounds, and
the different kinds of bound nominal elements (bound roots etc., including classificatory
elements) are described. Since possession is central for the semantic classification of nouns
and their morphological properties, this phenomenon is described separately in Ch. 6.
  Chapter 7 deals with Movima syntax. Here, clause structure and argument encoding are
described, the hierarchical alignment system is explained, and different sentence types are
presented. The syntactic effect of argument incorporation, whose morphological
characteristics are presented in Ch. 9, is also illustrated in this chapter. Chapter 7 furthermore
includes a description of the different types of subordination. In this way, negation, which is
expressed differently for main and subordinate clauses, can be described in one single section.
Coordination, which involves the combination of two main clauses, is described in Ch. 12,
which deals with the different types of coordinating particles.
  The three following chapters, 8, 9, and 10, are dedicated to verb morphology. In Ch. 8, the
intriguing system of voice and valency marking is described. Since this system interacts
closely with semantic and lexical properties of the verbal bases, the different types of verb
roots and bases are described in this chapter as well.
  Chapter 9 gives a more detailed account of complex verbal bases, which contain
morphological elements that interact with the valency of the verb. In the first part of this
chapter, the different types of noun incorporation are described: argument incorporation,
which leads to a decrease in valency, and modifier incorporation, which occurs prior to
valency assignment. The second part describes the causative, benefactive, and applicative
morphemes.
  Chapter 10 deals with other verbal morphemes, which have a modal and/or an aspectual
function. Formally, they have in common that they do not interact with verbal valency, even
though their function and productivity can be influenced by the valency properties of the base.
  In Chapter 11, nominalizing and verbalizing morphemes are presented. Some of these are
also described, where relevant, in earlier chapters, (e.g., in Ch. 3 on the noun/verb distinction,
in Ch. 7 on subordination). Since nominalization and verbalization often interact, both
processes are described together in this chapter.
  Chapter 12 gives an overview of the large class of particles. These inlude clause-
coordinating particles, TAM particles, and discourse particles.","[34, 35]"

(i)    Most languages have prefixes, and there are fewer prefix than suffix positions
       There is only one “real” prefix in Movima, the oblique case marker n-. Other prefixes
       are reduplicated elements. Otherwise, Movima is mainly suffixing.(j)    (On typical order of prefixes)
       Does not apply: only one prefix (n- or a reduplicated element) can occur at a time.(k)    Most verbal categories (e.g. tense, aspect, modality, direction) are expressed through
       optional suffixes
       All these categories are expressed not by suffixes, but by optional particles in
       Movima, whose distribution in the clause is relatively free. Tense is, in addition, a
       nominal category, expressed by referential elements.(l)    Subordinate clauses typically involve nominalized verbs, the type of subordination
       being marked on the verb
       Indeed, subordination (as well as main-clause negation) always involves
       nominalization of the predicate. The type of subordination, however, is either not
       overtly indicated, or indicated by a particle preceding the subordinate clause.(m)    If there is noun incorporation, typically only those nouns which are obligatorily
       possessed can be incorporated, and they typically precede the verb root
       There are different types of productive noun incorporation, involving unpossessed
       nouns or body-part-terms. Apart form body-part terms, obligatorily possessed nouns
       cannot be incorporated. The incorporated nominal element follows the root.(n)    In many languages adverbs and adpositions may be incorporated into the verb
       This does not seem to be the case in Movima.(o)    There is generally only a small class of lexical numbers
       Indeed, there are only four number terms, from 1 to 4, and the terms for 1 and 4 seem
       to be morphologically complex (“no other” and “several times two,” respectively).","[32, 33]"

11.1.2. Partial action/state nominalization
Clauses negated through the particles mo: ‘not yet’ or by the prohibitive particle ka’ ‘don’t’
(cf. 12.5.3 and 12.5.4), as well as negative relative clauses (cf. and 7.15.2 and 12.5.2), also
involve action nominalization. However, unlike in clauses negated through the particle kas
described in the previous section, only monovalent predicates are nominalized in these
constructions, whereas bivalent predicates remain unmodified (cf. Ch. 8 for the valency
distinction of predicates). Furthermore, unlike in canonical action nominalization, the
nominalized predicate in these constructions is not relational. In the remainder of this section,
I illustrate this type of nominalization by using examples with the particle mo:. For examples
with the prohibitive particle ka’, see 12.5.4; for examples of negative relative clauses, see
7.15.2 and 12.5.2.
   To observe the difference between the treatment of monovalent and bivalent predicates in
these constructions, consider the examples in (25)a and b. Here, verbs with the base jam e
‘tied onto something’ occur in the mo:-construction. While the resultative, monovalent form
jam e ‘tied onto something’ in (25)a is nominalized, the direct bivalent form jama: e ‘to tie X
onto something’ in (25)b is not.(25)     a. mo: jam- e:-wa        as         pa:ko
            yet tie-CO-NMZ ART.n dog
            ‘The dog hasn’t been tied (onto something) yet.’                  {EA 19, 203a}         b. mo: i jam-a:- e           as     pa:ko
            yet 1 tie-DR-CO ART.n dog
            ‘I haven’t tied the dog (onto something) yet.’                    {EA 19, 203}Nominalization of a bivalent predicate would be ungrammatical in this construction. This is
shown by (26), where, as in (25)b above, the predicate is marked as bivalent by the direct

yet’, ka’ ‘don’t’, or in a negative relative clause. As in canonical action nominalization (cf.
11.1.1), a predicate nominal in these constructions undergoes infixing reduplication, as in
(27)a, or receives the nominalizing suffix - e, as in (27)b.(27)     a. di:ra ay       mo: to<ro:~>ro,               di:ra ay       tochi’

            ‘This one isn’t a bull yet, it’s still small.’                     {EA, 19, 291}
                                                                                             473
Note that in contrast to canonical action nominalization (cf. 11.1.1), the action nominals in
clauses with mo: ‘not yet’, ka’ ‘don’t’, or in negative relative clauses, are never relational.
Consider the nominalized forms in (25)a, (27)a and (27)b: in neither of these examples is the
argument attached to the predicate by an internal clitic, as it is in canonical action
nominalization (cf. 11.1.1).
  Thus, we are dealing here with a type of nominalization that is, in principle, identical with
canonical action nominalization (cf. 11.1.1). However, it does not apply to all bases, and it
does not create a relational noun. Therefore, I label it “partial nominalization”.11.1.3. -na ‘action nominalization of consequence’
The nominalizing suffix -na only occurs in adverbial clauses introduced by the particle jan
‘consequently’ (cf. 7.12.6), including interrogative clauses introduced by e -jan ‘why’ (cf.
3.10.6). Like canonical action nominalization (cf. 11.1.1), it occurs on monovalent as well as
on bivalent predicates. The resulting noun is always relational. Consider the example of a
monovalent predicate in (28) and of a bivalent predicate in (29):(28)        jan n-os          joy-na=y' i
            CSQ obl-ART.n.p go-DR=1pl
            ‘That’s why we went.’                                                {GC, Marcha 050}(29)        a'ko     jan n-as         loy         ye~yey-na=i
            PRO.n CSQ obl-ART.n NEG.SUB DR~want-NMZ.CSQ=pl
            as       eney, koro'-ni-wa         kos         dul-kay-a=i256
            ART.n (filler) DM.a.n-PRC-NMZ ART.n.a visit-INV-LV=pl
            ‘That is why they don’t want anybody to visit them.’                    {HR, TX 126}There are not many examples of a predicate nominal in an adverbial clause with jan.
However, unlike in canonical action nominalization, it seems that not only verbs, but also
nouns receive the suffix -na in an adverbial clause introduced by jan. In (30)a, the adjective
dinra ‘hard’ occurs in such a clause, and it receives the suffix -na. When this adjective occurs
in a clause with the negative particle kas, as in (30)b, it is nominalized through reduplication.
This is identical to the way in which other predicate nominals are modified in canonical
action nominalization (cf. 11.1.1). It can be concluded from this example that in adverbial
clauses introduced by jan, predicate nominals behave in the same way as verbal predicates.
This is in contrast to canonical action nominalization, where verbs and nouns undergo
different processes.(30)        a. jan     n-os         din-ra-na=is
               CSQ obl-ART.n.p hard-BE.ntr-NMZ.CSQ=pl.a
               ‘That’s why they were not hard.’                                       {HR, TX 257}256
      For the nominalization of the demonstrative predicate, cf. 11.9.4 below.","[495, 496, 497]"
"                                                                                               89
Since both nominalization (cf. 3.7.4) and adnominal inalienable possession are marked by
infixing reduplication, homophonous forms can occur. Consider the possessed noun in (93)a
and the negative predicate nominal in (93)b:(93)     a. is        charaye-<lo~>lo=i
            ART.pl syrup-<INAL~>BR.liquid=pl
            ‘their honey (of the bees)’         b. kas        charaye-<lo~>lo=i

(93)b) serves to disambiguate the homophonous forms. For a more detailed discussion of
nominalized predicates of subordinate and negative clauses, see 7.12 and 7.15, respectively.
For a description of the nominalizing processes, see 11.1.","[112, 113]"

1.9. Structural characteristics of Movima
Movima has many characteristics typical of Amazonian languages. I will compare it to the
features listed as typically Amazonian in Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999: 8f.).(a)    polysynthetic, head-marking, agglutinating with little fusion
       Movima is agglutinating, i.e., most morphemes have only one meaning, and displays a
       limited degree of fusion. It is head-marking in that one transitive argument as well as8
      possession are marked on the predicate or possessed noun, respectively. It is
      problematic to classify the language as polysynthetic, however. Polysynthetic features
      of Movima are that a clause can consist of the predicate alone, and that there is
      productive noun incorporation. However, while voice/valency and applicative
      categories are encoded by verbal morphology, tense, location, and direction (typical
      features of polysynthesis in Amazonian languages, cf. Payne 1990: 214) are not
      morphologically expressed on the verb, and person only to a limited degree.
      Moreover, Movima is syntactically fairly configurational (verb-initial), a feature
      untypical of polysynthetic languages.(b)   / / in the vowel inventory, contrastive nasalization of vowels
      Neither the central unrounded vowel [ ], nor contrastive nasalization of vowels exist in
      Movima. The five vowel phonemes are i, e, a, o, u.(c)   Extensive classifier and/or semantically based gender systems
      Movima has a semantically-based gender system, marked on the referential elements
      (articles, pronouns, demonstratives). This system is independent of the classifier
      system, which seems to have arisen through compounding and incorporation.(d)   Only few oblique cases
      Indeed, there is only one oblique case in Movima, marked by the prefix n- on the
      referential elements (articles and pronominal forms). Otherwise, case marking is
      absent.(e)   Possession marked on the possessed noun, not on the possessor; most widespread
      word order is ‘possessor possessed’
      Possession is marked on the possessed noun. Since the possessed noun is marked by
      an enclitic encoding the possessor, however, the word order is ‘possessed possessor’.(f)   Just one core argument cross-referenced on the verb
      This is true for Movima: the only core argument that is obligatorily cross-referenced is
      the transitive argument encoding the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy.(g)   ‘Split-ergative’ systems arise due to complex rules determining which core argument
      is cross-referenced on the verb
      A split-ergative pattern can indeed be observed in Movima, arising from the
      hierarchical alignment system: the transitive argument lower on the animacy hierarchy
      (in subordinate and negative clause, the argument higher on the hierarchy) is encoded
      like the intransitive argument, regardless of whether it is A or O.(h)   The bound pronominal forms marking a possessor within an NP are the same as one
      of the bound pronominal paradigms for marking core arguments of a clause
      This is indeed the case. The possessor is encoded in the same way as the first
      argument of a transitive clause, which is the only argument obligatorily encoded.","[31, 32]"
"
11.1. Action/state nominalization
Action/state nominalization (short: action nominalization) is the most productive
nominalizing process in Movima. It creates a noun that denotes an event or state. In contrast
to other nouns, an action/state noun can only occur in an NP or in a negative clause. This is to
say, it is either preceded by an article or by a negative particle, but cannot occur
independently.252 Unlike other words derived through nominalization, action nouns cannot be
nominalized a second time.
  Three subtpyes of action nominalization can be distinguished: canonical action
nominalization (cf. 11.1.1), “partial” action/state nominalization, which only occurs in
particular types of negative clauses (cf. 11.1.2), and action/state nominalization of
“consequence”, which only occurs in a subordinate clause introduced by the particle jan
‘CSQ’ (cf. 11.1.3). In Table 31, an overview of the properties of the three types is given.
Each type is described in more detail in the following sections.",[490]

                                                                                               501
12.1.1. Conjunctive coordination: che ‘and’
Full clauses can be combined by simple juxtaposition. The following is an example of this, in
which the division between the clauses is indicated by a comma, symbolizing a brief pause:(2)     che isne       chi:~chi        n-os         chora:da, chus-waj-kay

        obl-ART.n.p go-DR
        ‘And she went out onto the street (and) showed me where to go.’
        {GC, Bacho 056}Generally, however, the coordinating conjunction che ‘and’ is used, which can combine noun
phrases and clauses. Example (3) shows two coordinated NPs, example (4) contains three
clauses combined by che:(3)     jayna rey way-na=sne            os        balde che         os      loto:ba
        DSC again take_up-DR=f.a ART.n.p bucket and                 ART.n.p jug
        ‘Then again she took up the bucket and the jug.’                 {EA, Ay’ku I 052}(4)     jayna rey i’ne         jo’yaj che de:-che che joro:-kwa i’ne

        ‘She had arrived already and had gone to bed and was sleeping.’ {EA, Anoche 009}Coordinated clauses are further illustrated by the following examples. While (4) above
involved only intransitive clauses, example (5) illustrated transitive–transitive, and (6) and (7)
intransitive–transitive coordination:(5)     dewaj-na=sne os            chora=os         modin a:ris

        ‘The sun heats the bamboo sticks and (they) are making a cracking sound.’
        {EA 13, 011}12.1.2. Disjunctive coordination: kabo ‘or, otherwise’
The particle kabo indicates that the second clause presents a possible alternative to the event
described in the main clause. It possibly originates from the combination of a negative
particle kas or ka: (cf. 12.5.1) and the conjunction bo ‘because, so that’ (cf. 12.1.4).(9)     jay’      ja:mi-ki-kwe                  kabo was-ti-kwe        mora’

        ‘Beat your horse! Or are you on foot?’                             {JA, TX 115}Often, the particle kabo is followed by a clause marked with the hypothetical particle di’ (cf.

        ‘Maybe you still play [basket ball] there, or maybe you don’t.’ {EA, Basket 013}The particle kabo can also occur clause-initially.(13)    kabo di’ kas ba:-lowes-na:-wa                     n-as        Boco:co,

12.1.3. Adversative coordination: ban ‘but’
The function of this particle is to indicate that the situation described in the second clause
stands in contrast to that described in the first:(14)    yey-na is           maropa, ban kas rey miri’-na:-wa os

The particle bo between two clauses indicates that the second clause expresses the reason for
the event described in the preceding clause (‘because’).(16)    kas     nokowa      dejal-wa,      jankwa=sne,

described in the main clause. In the examples, the subordinate clauses are underlined.(20)    alwani:-kay      bo      as      pu~pu -wa          kis         jo’me

to a predicate. As was shown in 12.1.5, the hypothetical particle can also have a clause-
combining function, introducing conditional clauses. In the following examples, it is shown
that the modal function of di’ is different, since it neither combines two clauses, nor does it
imply a condition.(155)   che di’ rey ta:ra--’nes            mora’a,       ta:ra--’ne

‘optative’, disoy ‘counterfactual’, and didi’ ‘frustrative’, described in the following sections.
12.3.6. dis ‘optative’
The particle dis is very similar to the hypothetical di’ (cf. 12.3.5). It indicates irrealis mood,
and implies that the speaker wishes the occurrence of an event:(161)   ma’a         che pa’a           diyos di:ra dis in            jayaw-lo:maj

single form. This is described in the following section.12.3.7. disoy ‘counterfactual’
The particle disoy is probably composed of dis ‘optative’ (cf. 12.3.6) and joy ‘speculative’ (cf.
12.3.3). It occurs in main clauses and can also introduce subordinate clauses. It indicates
counterfactuality:(165)   disoy kayni        an bo          je:ni        an

        {EA, Alojamiento 029}
12.3.8. didi’ ‘frustrative’
The particle didi’ occurs immediately before or after the predicate or inside an NP. It indicates
that the actor had the intention of carrying out the action indicated by the verb, but was not
able to do so. In most cases, the reason why the action could not be carried out is given in the
subsequent discourse, as in (170) and (171)(170)   che didi’      joy-che --i’, ban jayna i’nes rey            Modesta
        and FRUST go-R/R--pl but DSC ART.f again Modesta

In (172), it can be seen that the frustative particle also has this function in negative contexts.
Here, the protagonist does not want to do a certain thing, in this case, to have her birthday
party in the neighbouring town. However, the particle didi’ indicates that she ends up doing it
anyway, as is explained in (173).

12.3.10. toje ‘very’
The particle toje (pronounced as [t ] in rapid speech) has an emphasizing function. It is
usually translated into local Spanish as caramba ‘good grief!’. In contrast to the Spanish
expression, however, toje is never used as an exclamation of its own.(177)        ban toje     ba:-ra             ja’ sa:-ra-na=as

12.3.11. ja’ ‘just’
The particle ja’ is very frequent. It can be translated as ‘just’, ‘only’, ‘just like that’ or
‘nothing else’. The following are some examples:(180)        ja’ as            kalye ja’a      os        joro-na=sne

12.3.12. an ‘evidential’
The only evidential marker (apart from the demonstratives, which imply first-hand
knowledge; cf. 4.9) is the particle an. The central functions of this particle seem
contradictory: on the one hand, it is used to indicate that the speaker knows about the event
only from hearsay.271 On the other hand, it is used to catch the hearer’s attention, often for
things that are being witnessed at the moment of speaking. There seem to be no formal
criteria by which these functions can be distinguished. The ‘hearsay’ function is illustrated by
(183)–(185):271
      In local Spanish, this is expressed by the interjection dizque ‘they say’.","[552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557]"
"
3.7.4. Nominalization of predicate nominals
The predicate of a subordinate or negative clause is generally nominalized in Movima (cf.
7.12, 7.15, and 11.1).43 This concerns both verbal predicates as well as predicates that are
morphologically nouns, i.e. predicate nominals. Verbal predicates are nominalized through
the suffixation of -wa. A predicate nominal, in contrast, is marked by infixing reduplication.
Example (90) illustrates this for a subordinate clause, which is, in fact, an oblique noun
phrase:(90)        n-os          tolkos<ya:~>ya
            obl-ART.n.p girl<NMZ.N~>
            ‘when I was a girl’ [lit. “at my being a girl”]Example (91) shows the reduplicated noun in a negative clause:(91)        kas     ya:lowe-<pa~>pa=u
            NEG drink-<NMZ.N~>AG=m
            ‘He’s not a drinker.’                                               {EA 9, 146a}As will be argued in 3.10 below, the fact that predicate nominals are reduplicated when they
occur in negative or subordinate clauses, whereas verbal predicates receive the suffix -wa in
these constructions, is seen as a defining criterion for the morphological distinction between
nouns and verbs in Movima.",[112]
"

1.11. Presentation of the data
The presentation of the Movima data as well as the English translation given deserve some
explanation.
  When a bivalent predicate in Movima is not combined with a cliticized referential element,
this automatically implies that the first argument is the first person singular. All bivalent
verbs, furthermore, have an implicit second argument, even though it is not obligatorily
overtly realized. Therefore, a simple bivalent verb without person marking is translated into
English as a full clause with a first person singular subject; the implied second argument is
always represented as “X”:(1)     sal-na    ‘I look for X.’Temporal categories are often not overtly indicated in Movima, but inferred from the context.
Hence, a clause unmarked for tense can imply any temporal category (past, present, future),
and example (1) can mean ‘I (have) looked for X,’ ‘I will look for X,’ etc. This is a problem
for the English translation, which I have solved as follows: examples where no context exists
(in particular, elicitation examples) are translated into the English simple present, even when
this does not sound like good English. Examples where a temporal context exists, even when
this cannot be seen in the example itself, are translated in a way which fits into this context
(e.g., ‘I looked for X’ in (1)). In many examples, the translation fits with the Movima data,
since tense is often reflected in the article.
  An area where Movima displays finer differentiations than English is spatial deixis: articles,
pronouns and demonstratives always indicate whether a referent is present, absent, in
existence or out of existence. Unless relevant for the discussion, I do not reflect these
categories in the English translation:(2)     a. i’nes kwe:ya            b. kinos     kwe:ya     c.        isnos     kwe:ya
           ART.f woman                ART.f.a woman                  ART.f.p woman
           ‘the/a woman (present)’    ‘the/a woman (absent)’         ‘the/a woman (deceased)’
           ‘the/a woman’               ‘the/a woman’                 ‘the/a woman’Occasionally, I use the indices i and j when it is necessary to indicate whether two are
coreferential or not:(3)     di’ joy-sicha’kwa=‘ne joy-che --i’ne, jankwa=sne
        HYP go-DES=f                  go-R/R--f        say=f.a
        ‘If she i wants to go, she i goes, shej said.’In the English translations, I use round brackets (as in (2)a and b) for relevant information
implicit in the Movima example. Contextual information, which cannot be inferred from the
example, is given in square brackets:(4)     sal-na      ‘I look for [her].’Many particles indicating tense, aspect, and mood (henceforth TAM) and discourse particles                                                                                             13
are hard to translate. For example, it is not clear how the particle rey in (5), which occurs in
almost every sentence, should be translated:(5)      bo        rey     ban-cho           os       ben‘i
         REAS      again bare-BR.inside ART.n.p grassland
         ‘Because the savannah was flat (you know/of course?).’             {EA, Cbba 164}Therefore, I often do not translate these particles.
  Square brackets with dots […] in the Movima example mean that a part of the text has been

  It was necessary to employ special symbols representing different morphological processes.
Most are taken from the Leipzig Glossing Rules of 2003, like those given in (6).13 Others,
shown in (7), are specifically introduced for the purpose of the present description.(6)      ~       reduplication
         <>      infixation(7)      =       (internal) cliticization
         --      external cliticizationAs suggested by the Leipzig Glossing Rules, I sometimes use a colon ( : ) in the glosses when
it is not practical to segment the Movima word. For example, when a morphologically
complex noun is incorporated into a verb, this process can be represented more adequately
when the different morphemes of the noun are not set apart. In (8), an example is given of a
complex noun (cf. (8)a) that is incorporated into a verb (cf. (8)b). From the glosses in (8)b, it
can be seen that the noun consists of several morphemes. In (8)c, the morphemes are
separated; here, it is not directly clear from the representation whether the suffix - e modifies
the verb or, as is actually the case, belongs to the noun.(8)      a. kwa-n- e                          b. ban-kwan e         c. ban-kwa-n- e

(cf. Table 1), followed by either a word, an abbreviation, or a number. In text examples, the
speaker code is followed by words or by an abbreviation indicating the text, as shown (9)a.

verbalizing suffix -ni suggests that -nana’ creates a noun. However, this is contradicted by the
fact that when nominalized in a subordinate clause, the suffix -wa is attached to the base
ending in -nana’, as in (84). Nominal bases would either be verbalized by -ni first, or they
would undergo reduplication (cf. 11.1.1, 11.9).(84)     ba:-ra           ja’ i jiram-poj-kay      os kuynana’-wa

"As can be seen, Movima only deviates in minor points from the typical Amazonian patterns
observed by Dixon and Aikhenvald, while the similarities are striking. In the following
paragraphs, I will point out some other features of Movima, not mentioned in connection with
the list above.
  Lexical tone, a feature found in a number of Amazonian languages, is not present in
Movima. Instead, there is contrastive vowel length. A consonant which deserves special
mention, since it does not seem to be common in the area, is the voiceless lateral fricative / /.
The syllable structure is simple: either CV or CVC.
  Morphological features which deserve special mention include the existence of an infix,
inserted according to metric criteria. Different types of reduplication are not only frequent, but
also serve a wide range of functions which are noteworthy from a cross-linguistic perspective.
These include, among other things, voice marking, the marking of inalienable possession, the
expression of predicative possession, and nominalization. Furthermore, Movima uses10
different cliticization processes to distinguish grammatical relations.
  The major parts of speech, distinguished by their morphological properties, are verbs,
nouns, and particles. Adjectives form a subclass of nouns. Referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) constitute a category of their own, but display nounlike rather than
verblike properties. The class of particles is heterogeneous, the defining feature being that
particles are not productively combined with other morphemes. There are no ideophones.
  The fine-grained system of reference and deixis, expressed by referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) is highly complicated, something which is not uncommon for
Amazonian languages. Gender, number, presence, absence, visibility, position, and motion
form the main parameters of deictic reference. The system also marks temporal categories on
nominal constituents, differentiating between actual or future existence and ceased existence
of the referent.
  Compounding and incorporation occur frequently. The different degrees of lexicalization of
words created by these processes make the morphological description of Movima difficult.
The morphological entities that can form part of a compound or can be incorporated into a
verb are nouns, noun roots, truncated nominal elements, and other bound elements with
lexical content. Many of these morphemes have a classificatory function, indicating shape and
consistency of an entity. All this is typical for Amazonian languages (cf. Payne 1990).
Demonstratives and other pronouns are not combined with nominal elements.
  Inalienable possession is an important criterion for the semantic classification of nouns.
Relational (inalienably possessed) nouns have to be overtly marked when denoting an
unpossessed or inalienably possessed entity; conversely, non-relational nouns are overtly
marked when denoting an inalienably possessed entity.
  A clause can have maximally two core arguments, depending on the valency of the verb.
The valency of a verb is generally overtly indicated by voice markers, which also specify the
semantic role(s) of the argument(s). The productivity and function of voice markers depend
on semantic properties of the base. Grammatical relations are distinguished by the way in
which the argument is cliticized to the base. It seems that Movima displays syntactic
ergativity, most clearly in relative clauses.
  As mentioned above, only the transitive argument higher on the animacy hierarchy is
obligatorily encoded. Strikingly, there is no obligatory marker for the first person singular, so
that this person is implicit on a bivalent predicate unmarked for person. This is untypical for
Amazonian languages (Dan Everett, p.c.). It has to do with the fact that, while all persons,
except the first, are encoded by enclitics, first and second person are (also) encoded by
optional bound pronouns preceding the predicate. The first person is not encoded by an
enclitic, but by the optional preverbal form only.
  There is no copula. Instead, in equational or possessive clauses, nouns function as
predicates. Morphological verbs can occur in NPs, their voice marker specifying the referent.
Serial verb constructions only exist to a very limited degree, and always involve verbs of
directed motion.","[33, 34]"
"                                                                                                                141
The forms of the article presented in Table 11 can, therefore, be split up into two elements.
However, the element a in (33) still functions as a determiner, even though it lacks the
determining morpheme /s/. Possibly, the final / / is a conflation of the determiner /s/ and the
first-person marker / /. A solution cannot be proposed here. Therefore, I will not represent the
article as consisting of two morphemes: the contexts in which its elements can occur
separately from each other are very restricted, and there are cases in which a morphemic
analysis is not appropriate, as in (33). Here, the article will be represented as a single form, a .
   A particle which is formally very similar to the article is the main-clause negative particle
kas. It looks like the presential neuter article preceded by a k-, and it is obligatorily combined
with a nominal form, i.e., an action nominal (cf. (34)). Moreover, the first-person marker also
replaces the final s of this word, in the same way as shown for the article in (33) (cf. (34)b):(34)    a. kas    joy-wa=n               b. ka     joy-wa=n

           ‘You don’t go.’                  ‘We (incl.) don’t go.’The negative particle is described in 12.5.1.
  It is crucial to note that the Movima article is neutral with respect to definiteness. When a
visible entity is referred to, definiteness is implied by a demonstrative, as in (29)−(32) above.
When the referent is absent, definiteness is expressed by the demonstrative adverb ney ‘here’
(from n-ay ‘obl-DM.spk.n’, cf. 4.6) directly after the article, as in (35) and (36):(35)    in a      ona-di:-na           kos       ney ro:ya, ona-waj-na

        ‘This mister Juan Hualima, he is good, he is a good man.’ {EA, Dokoylakwa 001}The same holds for referents which have ceased to exist, as in (37) and (38):(37)    asko       rey    jeya=os             ney no:no di’ pako,

        pretty-CAU-INV ART.pl here earring
        ‘I liked those earrings.’Referents that are present in the speech situation cannot be marked as definite in this way.
This is demonstrated by the ungrammaticality of (39)b, as opposed to (39)a:142

4.5.        Towards a morphological analysis of the third-person referential
            elements
When all third-person referential elements are taken together, some morphological patterns
can be recognized, even though they are not fully transparent. In this section, I will just point
out some morphologically transparent features. Table 12 below gives an overview of the
morphological segmentation of the elements, whose separate morphemes, however, cannot
always be semantically identified in a straightforward manner. Elements which only appear in
certain phonological environments (like i- in the feminine form) or which are clearly
additional markers (like -l- in the distal forms) are given in brackets.","[164, 165, 166]"

The particle kwey, with the long form kweyka, indicates that an event has been concluded on
the day of speaking, but before the moment of speaking (cf. section 12.4 for its distribution in
comparison to kaw, which is often realized as /kwej/, too).(49)    kwey joy-che         us      pa:pa=kinos           majni

        {EA, Neighbours 019}The marker kwey marks the same time span as the absential article with an action noun or a
temporal noun (cf. 4.8.2). Accordingly, when a clause with kwey also contains an action noun,
as in (51), or a temporal noun, as in (52), the noun is always combined with the absential
article:

above. This form also occurs frequently inside an NP. It shares this property with other tense
particles, such as la’ and kwil (cf. 12.2.2 and 12.2.3, respectively). An NP with kwey typically
contains a temporal noun, as in (54), an action nominal, as in (55), or a morphological verb, as

The particle la’ occurs most often inside or next to a noun phrase that contains a temporal or
action noun. It indicates the last occasion, before the day of speaking, at which the time or
event referred to took place. Hence, expressions such as ‘yesterday’ or ‘last year’ are formed
with la’. When la’ is combined with a noun phrase, this noun phrase always contains the past
article (cf. 4.8.2). The following examples are characteristic occurrences of la’:

        REM       PRO.1sg 1intr grassland-LN-VLC
        ‘Back then [when I was a child], I lived in the country.’            {HR, TX 005}Example (67) shows that the particles la’ and kwil can cooccur:(67)    in a       la’ kwil     joy-che n-as     marcha

        ‘I went to the demonstration back then.’        {GC, Marcha 001}12.2.4. nokowa ‘right now’
The tense particle nokowa, pronounced as [‘n kwa] in rapid speech, is derived from the
demonstrative adverb for elevated objects (nokowa ‘at that (elevated)’; cf. 4.6). The core
function of this particle is to indicate an upcoming event:(68)    jayna nokowa, jayna nokowa                don- e
        DSC right_now DSC right_now put_on-CO

             ‘But when he comes now in August, that will be when he tells me.’
             {EA, Patrona 043}Typically, nokowa is used for events on the same day, as in (68) and (69).
  In the examples above, it could be seen that the particle nokowa can occur together with a
main-clause predicate (cf. (68) and (69)), but also in a subordinate clause, i.e. inside an NP
with an action noun (cf. (70)). In both cases, it modifies the predicate, also the nominal form
in the subordinate clause.
  However, like other particles, nokowa can also occur inside a noun phrase with a concrete
referent. Here, it can be seen that it does not modify this noun, but the entire clause:(71)         n-as       jayna joyaj-wa=kus               nokowa      pa:pa=is          majni

             ‘When (right_now) the father of my children comes ...’ {EA, Buscar vivienda 010}12.2.5. jayna ‘discontinuative’
The particle jayna is one of the most frequent particles. It can be circumscribed as indicating
that a state or event holds when it did not before, or that it occurs or starts earlier than
expected.267 The following examples illustrate this particle in an affirmative and a negative
clause, respectively:(72)         n-asko       rey dichi<ye~>ye           tochi’, ban jayna to’baycho

translated as ‘and then’ or ‘at that moment’.","[533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538]"

      However, the preceding article or negative particle is occasionally dropped when the context is clear.",[490]

12 Particles and adverbsThis chapter gives an overview of the morphemes I label particles. For the time being, I
comprise under this label all words that are neither verbs, nouns, adjectives, or referential
elements. Most of them are clearly function words, while others are perhaps better analysed as
adverbs. This is a matter of further research. Also their precise number remains to be
established.
  Further research is also needed for a more fine-grained account of the properties of these
words, especially with regard to their syntactic scope and combinatory possibilities. Note that
several particles have different functions in different syntactic environments. I describe these
particles according to their respective functions.
  This chapter is organized as follows. Section 12.1 presents clause-combining particles.
These can have a coordinating or a subordinating function. The large group of TAM particles
is described in 12.2 and 12.3. It seems possible to separate tense- and aspect marking
particles, described in 12.2, from modal and epistemic particles, described in 12.3. A particle
which deserves special discussion is the focus particle kaw, already introduced in 7.8; its
similarities to and differences from the tense particle kwey are discussed in 12.4. Section 12.5
deals with negative particles, some of which were already introduced in 7.15 and in 11.1.
Some interjections are illustrated in 12.6, and the filler particle eney, apparently the only filler
in Movima, is presented in 12.7.","[523, 524]"
"                                                                                                     107
As can be observed from the list in (163) above, verbs are typically morphologically complex.
Unlike noun roots, most verb roots cannot occur on their own. When unmarked, which is the
case when they appear in the resultative voice (cf. 8.1.5), these roots are combined with the
dummy element -‘i (cf. 2.9.5):(168)   sal-’i     ‘to have been/have to be searched’
        ju:-’i     ‘to have been/have to be scolded’
        toroj-’i   ‘to have been/have to be dusted’There are only a few unanalysable verbs, such as ja:yi ‘run’ in (163). Examples of other verbs
of this type, which may be historically complex, include the following (with a tentative
morphological analysis, where possible):(169)   ilo:ni   ‘to walk, move forward’ (-ni ‘PRC’)
        iwa:ni   ‘to converse’            (-ni ‘PRC’)
        ya:lo:we ‘to drink’             (ya:- ‘under’?, -lo ‘BE.liquid’, -we ‘BE.person’)
        jo’yaj   ‘to arrive’
        salmo    ‘to return’Thus, while verbs are generally morphologically complex, this is not a defining characteristic
that distinguishes them from nouns.
  The defining feature of a verb is that it cannot be combined with nominal morphemes (cf.
(174) below). Furthermore, verbs are productively combined with typical verbal morphemes,
for example:(170)   -wa        action/state nominalization
        -pa        agent nominalization
        -poj       causative
        -kwa       benefactive
        -ka        immediative/impossibilitive
        -u’~-ay’   intensive
3.10.2. Nouns
Nouns prototypically express time-stable concepts. Accordingly, the following can be seen as
prototypical Movima nouns:(171)   champa       ‘stone’
        ro:ya        ‘house’
        pa:ko        ‘dog’
        kwe:ya       ‘woman’
        china a      ‘manioc’
        ko’o         ‘tree’
        me:sa        ‘table’
        Leonilda     proper name108
A noun typically occurs in a noun phrase. A noun phrase is defined by the fact that it contains
a determining referential element, usually an article, that specifies gender, number, and deictic
properties of the referent (cf. 4.4). In (172), noun phrases are given which contain the above
nouns:(172)   as    champa       ‘the/a stone’
        as    ro:ya        ‘the/a house’
        as    pa:ko        ‘the/a dog’
        i’nes kwe:ya       ‘the/a woman’
        is    china a      ‘(the) manioc roots’
        as    ko’o         ‘the/a tree’
        as    me:sa        ‘the/a table’
        i’nes Leonilda     ‘Leonilda’The occurrence in a noun phrase is not restricted to nouns: verbs can occur in a noun phrase
as well, as was shown in 3.10.1. And while this is more typical of verbs, a noun can also
occur outside a noun phrase, in which case it functions as a predicate (cf. 7.9.1). In (173)a and
b, the noun kwe:ya ‘woman’ is combined with referential elements representing the
arguments of the equational clauses.(173)   a. in    kwe:ya            b. kwe:ya--‘ne
           1intr woman                woman--f
           ‘I am a woman.’            ‘She is a woman.’Since nouns can function as predicates and verbs can occur in noun phrases, the syntactic
position is not a defining property of these word classes.
  A typical morphological property of nouns is that most of them, unlike most verbs, can
consist of a single root. The nouns in (171) and (172) are examples of independent roots.
However, since some noun roots cannot occur independently (cf. 3.1, 5.3.2), while some,
probably historically complex, verb roots can (cf. 3.10.1 below), this is not a defining
characteristic for distinguishing nouns from verbs, either.
  The defining characteristic of nouns is that the morphemes in (174) can only be attached to
nominal bases, but not to verbs:(174)   -ti’       VBZ           (‘to make N’)
        -maj       VLC           (‘to be in/on N’)
        -ni        PRC           (‘to be/become N’)
        Foot~      POSS          (‘owner of N’)
        <CV~>      NMZ.N         (‘being N’)The most productive distinction between nouns and verbs is the form that verbal predicates
and predicate nominals take in negative or subordinate clauses. When the predicate is a
morphological noun, it is marked by infixing reduplication (<CV~>), as in (175)a and b. A
                                                                                             109
verbal predicate, in contrast, receives the suffix -wa in a subordinate or negative clause, as
shown in (176)a and b:(175)   a. n-as       kwe<ya:~>ya               b. kas       kwe<ya:~>ya
           obl-ART.n woman<NMZ.N~>                 NEG       woman<NMZ.N~>
           ‘when I am a woman’                     ‘I am not a woman.’(176)   a. n-as       iloni:-wa                 b. kas       iloni:-wa
           obl-ART.n walk-NMZ                      NEG       walk-NMZ
           ‘when I walk’                           ‘I don’t walk.’However, while a verb cannot take the nominal suffixes in (174), this does not mean that a
base that can be combined with the verbal suffixes in (170) above. Nouns can be combined
with these suffixes, even though this is of limited productivity and may be the result of a more
complicated process, which can be outlined as follows.
  The verbalizing suffix -ti’, described in 11.5, is one of the most productive derivational
elements. It creates an monovalent verb that denotes a typical activity connected with the
entity denoted by the noun:(177)   in     roya:-ti’
        1intr house-VBZ
        ‘I build a house.’(178)   in    sutulra:-ti’
        1intr armadillo-VBZ
        ‘I hunt armadillo.’Like any other verb, the denominal verbs derived by the suffix -ti’ can receive additional verb
morphology. However, as is also the case with most monovalent voice suffixes, the suffix -ti’
is omitted before another suffix is attached (cf. 8.7.1 and 11.5). The meaning of the base
remains the same as when it contains the verbal suffix -ti’. Consider first the examples in
(179) of the nominalizing suffix -wa (cf. (176)) attached to the bases in (177) and (178)
above:(179)   a. n-as         roya:-wa   b. n-as         sutulra:-wa
            obl-ART.n house-NMZ        obl-ART.n armadillo-NMZ
            ‘when I build a house’     ‘when I hunted armadillo’
          * ’when I am a house’      * ‘when I am an armadillo’Here, the bases ro:ya- and sutulra- are not nouns, but the verbal bases ‘build a house’ and
‘hunt armadillo’, respectively, whose suffix -ti’ is omitted before further suffixation. When
nominal bases occur independently as a predicate, they denotes the state of ‘being X’ (cf. also
(173) above):
110
(180)    a. a’ko      ro:ya                   b. a’ko     sutulra
             PRO.n house                         PRO.n armadillo
             ‘That is a house.’                  ‘That is an armadillo.’
           * ‘That builds a house.’             * ‘That hunts armadillo.’Consider also the following examples of the base ro:ya:ti’ ‘build a house’, reduced to ro:ya-,
with other verbal suffixes: causative in (181), benefactive in (182), and agent-nominalizing in
(183).(181)    loy i         roya-poj-na         us    itila:kwa
         ITN 1         house-CAU-DR        ART.m man
         ‘I’ll have the man build a house.’                                                  {JM 18, 175a}(182)    u’ko=         roya-kwa-n-kay
         PRO.m.=1 house-BEN-LN-INV
         ‘He builds a house for me.’                                                       {HR 14, 145}(183)    u’ko        roya:-pa
         PRO.m       house-AG
         ‘He is a house-builder.’                                                          {HR 14, 145a}Thus, even though they seem to be superficially compatible with nominal bases, the suffixes
in (170) identify a base as verbal.52
  An interesting case of words which are considered verbs from the semantic point of view,
but which are morphologically nouns, concerns the words jankwa ‘say’ and jampa ‘do like’.
One indication that these are rather nouns than verbs is that, when nominalized, they first
undergo verbalization by -ni ‘PRC’:(184)    n-os          jankwa-ni:-wa
         obl-ART.n.p say-PRC-NMZ
         ‘when I said …’The status of these words will be discussed in more detail in 8.5.2.","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"

1.7. History of linguistic description
The first materials of the Movima language are lists of words and phrases (Hervás y Panduro
1787, D’Orbigny 1838, Heath 1883, Cardús 1886, Chamberlain 1910, Créqui-Montfort &
Rivet 1914, del Castillo 1929). Of these older lists, the one produced by the missionary
Cardús (1886) is most reproduced in the literature. In the 1960s, Movima was studied
extensively by Robert and Judith Judy of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. The results
include a word list with a grammatical sketch (1962a), an outline of the phoneme inventory
(1962b), two articles on specific topics (J. Judy 1965 and R. Judy 1965), and a tagmemic
grammar (1965 and 1967).
  A government-financed alphabetization campaign led by Colette Grinevald in 1995 raised
new interest in the language. An alphabet was created by the speakers, mainly based on the
orthography used by Judy and Judy, but with some changes (most importantly, c and qu were
replaced by k). The workshops, furthermore, resulted in the publication of a collection of
stories in Movima (Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Planificación 1998) and in a course
book introducing the alphabet (Ministerio de Educación et al. 2003). Also, Colette Grinevald
published an article on Movima noun classifiers (Grinevald 2002). Of the several unpublished
materials inspired by the workshops, an extensive word list by Eligardo Chirimani (1998)
deserves special mention. It needs to be said that without those workshops, the present
grammar may not have been written: it is because of the interest expressed by the Movima
participants that Movima was proposed to me as a language of research.
  The present research project is part of the Spinoza project “Lexicon and Syntax” directed by
Pieter Muysken, which aims at describing as many of the language isolates in Amazonian
Bolivia and Brazil as possible. It is hoped that it will serve as a basis for the production of
materials that will help the Movimas to teach and learn their ancestral language.",[29]

Usually, a bivalent root is combined with the agentive voice marker -e e, which creates a
monovalent base, before -baycho or -sicha’kwa is attached:(92)    sal-e -sicha’kwa
        search-AGT-DES
        ‘I want to search.’The suffix -sicha’kwa indicates that the actor wants to or has a physical urge to carry out the
action denoted by the verbal base, or that the event is about to happen. The difference is
determined by semantic properties of the verbal base. On a base which denotes an action, the
suffix indicates a desire. On a base which denotes an event whose only participant is an
undergoer, the suffix indicates that the event is about to occur.
  The following examples illustrate -sicha’kwa as a desiderative marker on actor-oriented
bases (cf. also (90) and (92) above):(93)    in a       joy-sicha’kwa     n-ulkwan

        ‘She isn’t married yet, she still wants to study.’               {HR, TX 227}In (95)–(97), the base denotes an event whose participant is an undergoer. Here, the suffix
indicates that the event denoted by the base is about to happen:(95)    jayson in      tami-sicha’kwa,      payes-na jayson os

The following example illustrates a weather verb, lu’-ti’ (rain-VBZ), in combination with the
desiderative suffix -sicha’kwa. Here, this suffix indicates that the event is about to occur.
Note that the suffix -ti’ is dropped before further suffixes (cf. 8.7).246(98)     lu’-sicha’kwa jayna,        paya’-ni    as       benra

         ‘It was already about to rain, the sky was dark.’                     {EA, Tomina’ 080}A physical urge as indicated by the desiderative suffix is illustrated in (99) and (100). This is
an intermediate category between the actor-oriented (cf. (93), (94)) and the undergoer-
oriented use (cf. (95)–(97)) illustrated above. The verb roots which are involved here are
normally combined with the suffix -kwa ‘bodily process’ (cf. 8.3.2). When the desiderative
suffix -sicha’kwa is attached, the suffix -kwa ‘BDP’ is dropped.(99)     jayna n-os             ta:ra:-wa,         in     choj-sicha’kwa,

         ‘When the second hour [of the session] starts, I am already tired.’{EA, EA&AH 094}I will now turn to the suffix -baycho. This suffix, which I term “mental state”, appears in two
different environments. Its function is clearest in negative contexts, where it indicates that the
participant is reluctant to carry out the action denoted by the base. Here, the suffix -baycho is
as productive as -sicha’kwa, and the two suffixes clearly contrast in meaning. Compare (101)
below with (93) above:(101)    kas joy-baycho=sne         jayna ja’a

argument is expressed like a possessor or like the first argument in a transitive clause (ARG1).
That is, the argument is obligatorily expressed by an internal clitic, as in (101); when the
argument is the first person singular, it is optionally encoded by the proclitic element of Set 1,
i.e., by attached to the preceding vowel (cf. 3.9.3, 4.1.2, 7.4):246
    Note that also in (87) and (95) above, the suffix -sicha’kwa is attached to bases from which the verbalizing
suffix -ti’ is dropped. The basic forms of those verbs are jo -ti’ ‘to lay eggs’ (egg-VBZ) and tami:-ti’ ‘to give
birth’ (birth-VBZ), respectively.","[467, 468, 469]"

that when functioning as the predicate of a negative or subordinate clause, adjectives also
undergo infixing reduplication. Examples (12) and (13) illustrate this.(12)        n-os          ja<ya~>yaw-a=a,         a’ko=     as-na,     a’ko=        joro:-na

negative or subordinate clause, whose applicability indicates a subtle difference between
nouns and verbs. This concerns the suffixation of - e.255 Examples (14) and (15) show that
reduplication and the suffixation of - e are, in principle, equivalent. Due to this equivalence, I
also gloss the suffix - e as ‘NMZ.N’.(14)         a. kas         cho<’e~>’es-a=a

There are indications that the position of the word that denotes the more time-stable concept
is semantically determined. In (183) and (185), this can be seen in the main clause, and in
(184) and (186), it can be seen in the relative clause. According to the contexts and intonation
patterns of the examples, it seems that a relative clause has a restrictive function when it
contains a word that denotes a less time-stable concept than the word that functions as the
head. In contrast, when the word that denotes the more time-stable concept is the predicate of
the relative clause, the relative clause is non-restrictive. Thus, in (183), the relative clause
restricts the main clause NP is juyeni ‘people’ to referents which are white and rich. In (185),
the relative clause indicates that the group of children referred to is restricted to clean
children. In contrast, in (184) and (186), there is no indication of a restrictive function of the
relative clause: in (184), the grandparents have been introduced in the preceding discourse,
and in (186), water is the discourse topic, so that there is no reason to assume that the dirty
stuff one is drinking is water as opposed to something else. In cases like these, the relative
construction is a case of non-restrictive modification, the modified noun functioning as the
predicate of the relative clause.
  The following examples are a further illustration of the semantic function of the position of
the content words. Here, the verb kayni ‘die’ belongs to the relative clause in (187) and to the
main-clause NP in (188). In (187), the relative clause has a restrictive function: of the
different aunts, the one who has died is the topic. In contrast, the construction in (188), us
kayni di’ (‘the dead one who’), is a common way to refer to deceased people.(187)   kinos     ney ay’ku di’ jayna kayni

        ‘My late grandfather [...] hadn’t gone to school.’       {EA, Abuelo 001}The predicate of a relative clause can also consist of an oblique NP, as in the second relative
clause in (189):(189)   kas manes-pa-na:-wa             is       ji:sa-na=i di’ refresko

the possessor of an entity. No distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is
made here, as the following examples show. The noun in (190) is alienably possessed and the
noun in (191) is inalienably possessed:

        [lit.: “in a bedroom which were of her”]                  {EA, Alojamiento 010}The relativized NP always constitutes the absolutive argument of the relative clause, and it is
never overtly present in the relative clause. In the above examples, the relative clauses contain
an intransitive predicate, so that the preceding NP is automatically interpreted as ARGintr.
When the relative clause is transitive, the grammatical status of the relativized NP is indicated
by the voice marker on the verb.
  This is illustrated in the following examples. The relativized NP, absent in the relative
clause itself, is underlined. In (192)–(194), the verb is marked as direct, which means that the
head NP is the undergoer in the relative clause (cf. 8.1.1):(192)   isos     wa:ka di’ chik<a>ye=is          neyru=s     ben‘i

        ‘The dog let go of the dried meat which it had torn down.’   {JM, Perro II 040}In (195) and (196), the verb is marked as inverse. This indicates that the head is the actor in
the relative clause (cf. 8.1.2):(195)   in a,      kus       pa:pa=is             majni,   che is         mo:so=us

        [or: “We were paid by that man by whom we were spoken to.”] {EA, Cbba 056}Another way to encode the head as the actor of a direct-marked verb, in the same way as with
independent clauses, is to insert the focus particle kaw (cf. 7.8) into the relative clause:(197)   kilmo         isko,     is     juyeni di’ jayna        kwey way-na    n-i’ne

        ‘What might be what caught (it)?’                             {EA, Jaguar 074}The following example, in which the head of the relative clause is ARG1, can be regarded as
an exception:(199)   is      pa:ko di’ lam-na=is
        ART.pl dog       REL bite-DR=pl.a
        ‘the dogs that bit [it]’                                    {EA, Tigre y perro 007}In most cases, it is the absolutive argument of the main clause that is modified by a relative
clause. This could be seen in (185), (194), and (196) above, where the main clauses are
transitive, and the relative clause modifies the absolutive argument. Relativization of ARG1,
in contrast, is rare. Consider the following example:(200)   jiwa- e-na=is         juyeni    di’ wa:~waka-wandi
        come-CO-DR=ART.pl person REL POSS~cow-INSTR:BE.house
        ‘The people who own ranches brought [it].’         {EA, Chaco III 048}Multiple relativization is common. This could already be seen in (183) and (189) above. More
examples are given in (201) and (202):(201)   os       sota’-ra   di’ pa:ko       di’ al-baycho-ni:-kay

main-clause NP or the (omitted) subject of the preceding relative clause. In (202), for
example, the second relative clause modifies the preceding one and not directly the main-
clause absolutive NP, because this would not make sense. In (203), both types occur: the first
relative clause, containing an adverbial phrase, modifies the main-clause NP, while the
subsequent three relative clauses modify the first relative clause.(203)       pen-che     n-os          wa:ka-wandi            di’ ney=s          juyeni

7.12.          Subordinate clauses7.12.1. General characteristis of subordinate clauses
In most subordinate clauses in Movima, the predicate is transformed into an action noun (cf.
11.1) and forms part of an NP. Since it is an NP, the subordinate clause can either be a
complement, i.e. a core argument of the clause (cf. 7.12.2), or an adjunct, i.e. an oblique
argument (cf. 7.12.3).
  Since a main-clause predicate can consist of a verb as well as of a noun, both these word
classes undergo nominalization when they function as the predicate of a subordinate clause. A
verb is nominalized by the suffix -wa, as shown in (11). A predicate nominal in a subordinate
clause is modified by infixing reduplication, as in (12). For a more detailed description of
these types of nominalization, see 11.1.(11)        n-os            sal-na:-wa

The predicate of a subordinate clause is a relational noun (i.e., obligatorily possessed; cf. Ch.
6). This implies that, unlike in main clauses, the intransitive argument in a subordinate clause
is encoded in the same way as ARG1. Consider the encoding of the second person in the main
clause in (13)a, by the pronoun of Set 2, with its encoding in the subordinate clause (a noun
phrase) in (13)b, by the internal clitic of Set 1:178(13)     a. ij    ji<wa:~>wa                b. n-as        jiwa-wa=n

            ‘you come’                         ‘when you come’Transitive subordinate clauses are not affected in this way, since ARG1 is encoded in the same
way as in the main clause. This can be seen in the main and subordinate direct transitive
clause in (204)a and b and in the main and subordinate inverse transitive clause in (14)a and
b.179(204)    a. sal-na=n
            search-DR=2

            REAS ART.n INV~search-NMZ=2
            ‘so that X looks for you’The fact that not only a nominalized bivalent, but also a nominalized monovalent predicate in
a subordinate clause is possessed, implies that the ergativity split found in affirmative main
clauses (cf. 7.5.3) is reversed. The argument of the intransitive clause (in (13)b, the bound
pronoun =n) is encoded in the same way as the actor in the nominalized direct clause (cf.
(204)b) and as the undergoer in the inverse clause (cf. (14)b).180
178
    Likewise, the nominalized forms in (11) and (12), unmarked for person, imply the first person singular.
179
    On nominalized verbs, the direct marker -na and the inverse marker -kay are replaced by CV~ and CVC~,
respectively; cf. 8.7.2.
180
     The same phenomenon can be observed in negative main clauses, which also involve nominalization (cf.
7.15).","[324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329]"
"                                                                                                                 427
However, verbs with -ka are different from other nominalized forms in that it is not clear
how the first person singular is encoded on a monovalent verb marked by -ka . The
expectation would be that the first person is encoded like a possessor, i.e. by the bound
pronoun from Set 1, i , instead of the Set 2 pronoun in. However, speakers are not certain
about this. The forms are used interchangeably, and often, the Set 2 pronoun is used
spontaneously. This was done independently by two speakers in the following example. The
clause in (6)a contains the form of Set 2, in, (6)b contains the form of Set 1, i :(6)     a. loy      in    loj-a’-oj-ka

morphosyntactic structure is the same as (2):(7)     *i    loj-a-’oj-ka          n-is       do’we
        1     wash-DR-BE.clothes-IM   obl-ART.pl clothes                    {EA 8, 136o}The problem of how the first person is expressed in a clause that contains a verb with -ka
cannot be solved here. This is especially the case since there are no text examples of a verb
with -ka which has an overtly expressed first person singular argument. However, the free
alternation between in and i is not found in canonical cases of nominalization. To analyse
-ka as a nominalizing suffix, therefore, would not be fully adequate.
10.1.2. -ka on voice-marked bases: ‘immediative’
Another peculiarity of the suffix -ka is that it has two very different meanings, depending on
the base it is attached to. On bases that contain voice marking, as described in 8.7, -ka
indicates that the event denoted by the verb takes place or starts earlier than normal; I will
refer to this meaning as “immediative”. On unmarked bivalent roots, which can usually not
serve as a base for further suffixation, however, it indicates that the action cannot be carried
out; I will call this function of -ka “impossibilitive”. I will here describe the immediative
function and turn to the impossibilitive function in 10.1.3.
  When -ka is attached to a verbal base of the type described in 8.7, it is usually translated by
the speakers as “at once” or “early”. Most often, the suffix occurs on roots that denote
directed motion, as is illustrated by (8)–(10):(8)     che di’ chi-ka -a=‘nes dichi:ye, i’nes majni,            joy-ka -a=‘ne

(11) shows a base that consists of a bivalent root with the agentive voice marker -e e (reduced
to -e ), which creates a monovalent base:(11)    jayna      jay e sal-e -ka -a=a             n-as          chammo

        {EA, Huevo 012}As could be seen in (4) above, -ka also occurs on bivalent bases. The following example
shows the two forms in which a bivalent base with the direct marker -na can occur (cf. 8.1.1):
the suffix -na can either be retained (cf. (12)a) or it can be replaced by CV-reduplication (cf.
(12)b).(12)    a. kwey     i      ra -na:-ka       as    lopa:vos

10.1.3. -ka on bivalent roots: ‘impossibilitive’
Unlike most other suffixes, the suffix -ka can be attached to a bivalent root that is unmarked
for voice. Recall from 8.1.5 that a bivalent root without a voice marker denotes a resultative
state. On an unmarked bivalent root, -ka indicates that the event denoted by the verb root
cannot be carried out. Usually, but not necessarily, the verb is preceded by the negative
particle kas (cf. 12.5.1). Consider the following examples, elicited from different speakers:(13)    ra -ka -a=as
        tear-IM-LV=n.a
        ‘It [e.g. manioc] can’t be pulled out.’

marker, where the suffix -ka has the “immediative” meaning (cf. (16)a), and a verb in which
the same root occurs without a voice marker, so that the suffix -ka adds the “impossibilitive”
meaning (cf. (16)b). According to the voice properties of the verb, in the direct transitive
clause in (16)a the actor is expressed as ARG1, and in the intransitive clause in (16)b, the only
core argument represents the undergoer.(16)     a. loj-na-ka -a=‘ne

impossibilitive meaning of -ka .240 This contrast is shown in (17), where a verb with the
applicative suffix - e ‘CO’ is combined with the suffix -ka . In (17)a, the base is marked as
bivalent direct by the voice marker -a. Here, -ka indicates that the event took place
immediately. In (17)b, in contrast, the base is unmarked for voice. On this base, the suffix -ka
indicates impossibility, as is confirmed by the particle kas.(17)     a. jam-a- e:-ka

“impossibilitive” reading of -ka with a complex verb containing an incorporated modifier
(-Ce ‘person’).","[450, 451, 452, 453]"

examples, or as the predicate of a relative clause, as in (35).
  When a noun with -pa functions as the predicate of a subordinate clause or a clause with the
negative particle kas, it undergoes infixing reduplication, as in (40) (cf. 11.1.1). This
identifies the word derived through -pa as a morphological noun; if it were a verb, it would
receive the suffix -wa in this construction (cf. 11.1.1, 3.10).
  When a bivalent base is combined with the agent nominalizer -pa, the resulting noun
denotes a place. This can be seen in the following examples, where the bases are marked as
bivalent by the base-final direct voice marker -a or -na (cf. 8.1.1):(41)    ney a’ko      chon i          dewaj-na:-pa--’ne

once, not habitually. This is in contrast to the locational suffix -kwi (or -pi) on bivalent bases
(cf. 9.5) and the direct voice marker -na on monovalent bases (cf. 8.1.1, 8.3.2). These suffixes
imply that the situation habitually occurs at that place. The contrast is illustrated by the
translations of (44)a and b. In (44)a, a verb is marked as a locative expression by the suffix -pi
‘LOC’ (cf. 9.5), which implies that the event occurs habitually. In (44)b, in contrast, the verb
is combined with the suffix -pa, and this implies that the action occured only once. Note also
that when the form with -pa denotes a location where the action is carried out habitually, it is
often accompanied by the habitual particle chon, as in (41) above. This is a further indication
that the idea of habituality is not implied in the locational meaning of -pa.(44)    a. a’ko=       lo~loj-pi:-na             b. a’ko    lo~loj-pa

11.3. Nominalization through a bound nominal element
A verb can be nominalized by attaching a bound nominal element. There are not many
examples of this. In (45)b, a complex verb is turned into a noun by the bound nominal
element -ra:                                                                                              477

(46)a, the noun chammo ‘bush, forest’ is turned into a verb through the verbalizing suffix
-maj (cf. 11.6). In (46)b, this form receives the bound root -poy ‘animal’ and refers to animals
that live in the bush.(46)    a. chammo:-maj

Instrument nominalization is a more complex process. In this section, I will first describe the
forms and functions of the suffix that creates an instrumental noun, then the bases to which
this suffix can be attached, and finally, I will illustrate the lexicalized and idiomatic uses of
instrumental nouns.","[499, 500, 501]"

here in order to show that the presence of one of these morphemes in a word does not identify
the word as either a noun or a verb. Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that these morphemes
have a common origin.",[135]
"These variants are illustrated in (95). Notice that there are two examples of H-reduplication:
in (95) a., reduplication concerns a closed, and in (95)b, a long open syllable.(95)     a.   kar~karso:ne                      ‘to own trousers’         POSS~trousers (H)

the second choice leading to disyllabic (LL or LH) reduplication. In most disyllabic words44
  In a negative or subordinate clause, the argument is encoded in the same way as the possessor. Therefore, in
(93)a, the plural bound pronoun refers to the bees and in (93)b to the honey (a mass noun, cf. 4.7.2).",[113]
"
3.10.4.3.   Morphological characteristics of adjectives
The argument that all adjectives (nounlike and verblike) belong to the morphological class of
nouns is based on the fact that, unlike verbs, they can be combined with the nominal
derivational morphemes listed in (174) above. Most importantly, nominalization of a
predicative adjective, as of a predicative noun, is carried out by infixing reduplication. In
(207), this is shown for the nounlike, and in (208), for the verblike adjectives:(207)   a. n-os          me<re~>dek-a=a
           obl-ART.n.p big<NMZ.N~>-LV=n
           ‘when it was big’        b. n-as         bi<ja:~>jaw
           obl-ART.n old<NMZ.N~>
           ‘when I am old’(208)   a. n-as       din-<te:~>tej
           obl-ART.n hard-<NMZ.N~>BE.breath

           NEG much-BE.day<NMZ.N~>-LV=n.a
           ‘It (was) not (for) many days.’However, some morphological differences between nouns and adjectives can be discerned.
While the other nominal morphemes in (174) can, in principle, be attached to both nouns and
adjectives, their productivity varies according to the type of base they are attached to. The
verbalizing suffix -ti’, which is very productive on nouns, applies only to a limited degree to
adjectives. Moreover, the resulting verb seems to be more idiomatic:(209)   rapal-ti’
        red-VBZ
        ‘to prepare a red dye’
                                                                                           117

        old-VBZ
        ‘to make an old person (e.g. a doll by dressing it)’;
        ~ ‘to get oneself an old man/woman’In contrast, the verbalizing suffix -ni, which typically indicates a process, is far more
productively combined with an adjective than with a noun. On some adjectives, it literally
indicates a process, as on nouns (cf. 11.9.1). Compare the similar function of -ni on nouns
((211)a) and on adjectives ((211)b). Other adjectives always take the suffix -ni, and its
addition does not create a meaning difference; cases of this type are shown in (212), and the
similarity in meaning is illustrated by (213)a and b.(211)   a. itilakwa:-ni        ‘become a man’

have a different degree of productivity depending on the type of base they are attached to.
This can probably be attributed to semantic differences between the two classes.
  The point in which adjectives diverge most from nouns is that predicative adjectives are
often combined with a special nominalizing suffix - e in negative clauses, instead of
undergoing infixing reduplication (cf. (207), (208) above):

          {EA, Palomajna 004}Thus, also where morphology is concerned, adjectives can be considered nouns. There are,
however, tendencies which show that they have a special status within that word class: the
productivity with which they can be combined with certain nominal morphemes, as well as
the semantic effect of that combination, can differ from that of nouns.
  So far, I have considered nounlike and verblike adjectives together. In the following
section, similarities and differences between verblike adjectives and verbs will be discussed.","[140, 141, 142]"

7.14.     Questions and answers
As was described in 2.8.5, a question is marked by a particular intonation pattern: in a yes/no-
question, the antepenultimate syllable carries stress and high tone. When the penultimate
syllable is heavy (i.e., closed or long), stress and high tone are on the penultimate syllable. In
a content question, the highest tone is on the first syllable and is lowered towards the end of
the utterance.
  A yes/no question is exclusively marked by intonation, whereas a content question can, in
addition, contain a question word (cf. 3.10.6):(238)   che naya’       kos      ben‘i      dis en-na=is

        ‘What is it they eat, then?’                                     {AH, EA&AH 129}However, the question word is not an obligatory marker of an interrogative sentence. Often,
the focus of the question is implied, the only question marker being intonation (indicated here                                                                                              313

interrogative clause (marked by intonation), as in (241). However, that it is not a question

are narrated that took place in the speaker’s childhood or in a dream. This function is possibly
related to the indication of hearsay knowledge (cf. (183)–(185)). Example (191) is from a
dream narration, example (192) is from a childhood narration:(191)    an jankwa ney in a,               yey-na, pa’,

12.4. The focus particle kaw
The construction with kaw (often pronounced as kwey, see further below) was already
discussed in 7.8. It is a focus marker, the most salient property of which is to reduce the
valency of a bivalent verb. It thereby enables the former ARG1 to occur as the absolutive
argument in topic position. In addition, kaw has another, possessor-marking function. In this
section, I will first describe the possessor-marking function of kaw. After that, I discuss the
difference between this particle and the often homophonous tense particle kwey (cf. 12.2.1).
  The possessor-marking function of kaw may be related to its focalizing function described
in 7.8 (and cf. below for further examples). In this function, illustrated in (197) and (198), it
precedes a noun which is a generic term for the possessed entity. Together, the two words
denote the possessor of the entity. The possessum can be specified by an oblique noun phrase,
underlined in the following examples:(197)    is        mere’ ko’ kis              neyru, o’im, o’im-vos

         ‘The cows [...] didn’t have cut ears because they didn’t have an owner.’
         [lit.: “there was no domestic-animal-owner of them.’] {GB, Ganado 004}Curiously, the possessor-denoting expression with kaw is most often found as a lexical
expression in combination with the oblique-marked first person singular pronoun in a:(199)     kaw     n-in a
        ~ kwey    n-in a
          FOC     obl-PRO.1sg
          ‘owner’Also with this expression, the possessum can be specified by an oblique-marked noun phrase
(as in (197) and (198) above):(200)    bo       as      iy’ i-ni-wa            kwey    n-in a      n-as       akamba

The expression kwey nin a ‘owner’ occurs twice in (202) below. In this example, it can be
seen that the possessive-marking function of kaw can sometimes not be formally
distinguished from its focus function. Here, it occurs with the word asna ‘home’, which is
morphologically a verb. I will elaborate on this phrase below.(202)   di:ra tochi’ kwaj-na=y’ i kos            sinko-pe:so n-i’nes     kwey n-in a

        ART.f Modesta        PRO.f FOC obl-PRO.1sg obl-ART.n water
        ‘At least we give a small five pesos to the owner of the water of the tap, she is the
        owner of the house here [lit.: “she is the one who sits here”], Modesta, she is the
        owner of the water.’                                    {EA, Agua sucia 020}The phrase i’ne kwey asna ney in this example can be translated in two ways: as ‘she is the
one who sits here’ or, more appropriate in this context, as ‘she is the owner of the house here’.
The first translation is literal, while the second takes the lexicalized meaning of the word
asna, ‘home’, as basis. This example, where the category of a word oscillates between verb
and noun, shows that possessive marking may have developed out of the focus-marking
function.
  As could be seen in the examples so far, the focus particle has two variants: kaw and kwey.
Some speakers always use kwey, others generally use kaw and sometimes kwey. When asked,
speakers confirm the exchangeability of the forms:(203)       iy’ i      kaw        sal-na
        ~   iy’ i      kwey       sal-na
            PRO.1pl FOC           search-DR
            ‘We look for it.’                                                {ER 11, 015}For the tense particle kwey (cf. 12.2.1), there is no variant kaw. Therefore, I refer to the focus
particle as kaw. However, since the two particles are often homophonous, I will point out their
differences here.
  Apart from the fact that kaw can be realized as kwey, but not the other way round, the
particles differ in that the tense particle kwey is realized as kweyka in certain cases, as in
(204). In contrast, for the particle kaw this is not possible, as shown by (205)b.(204)   bo        jayna kweyka      ji:sa   kos      konvokato:riya
        REAS      DSC IMM           make ART.n.a announcement

the behaviour of bivalent verbs. The tense particle kwey (cf. (206)) typically occurs in clause-
initial position, while in a clause with kaw, this position is usually occupied by a free pronoun
(underlined):(206)   kwey in        ji<wa:~>wa
        IMM 1intr come<MD~>
        ‘I came earlier today.’                                             {EA, Visita 031}(207)   jayna isne        kwey joy-che

the verb. This means that the original ARG1 becomes the intransitive argument, encoded by a
free pronoun in topic position. The original ARG2 becomes an oblique argument, marked by
n- (cf. 7.6, 7.8). In contrast, with the tense particle, the valency of the verb is retained. The
difference can be seen in (208)a and b, respectively:(208)   a. kaw: focus, valency reduction:
           i’ne    kwey toroj-na       n-as      ro:ya

valency reduction indeed go together. Example (209)a shows that when the verb remains
bivalent, ARG1 cannot be put in focus. Example (209)b, in contrast, shows that when there is
no free pronoun in topic position, the valency of the verb cannot be reduced:(209)   a. ungrammatical: focus, no valency reduction:

             ?       dust-DR     obl-ART.n house
             (‘X has dusted the house today.’)                                      {EA 19, 248d}Another difference between the two constructions concerns intonation. The word kwey can
only be stressed when it is the tense marker, as in (206). In the case of the focus particle kaw,
as in (207), stress always falls on the free pronoun, not on the particle.
  The question is whether the focus particle kaw and the tense particle kwey have anything in
common, since the focus particle kaw is pronounced as kwey by many speakers. The
translations of some clauses that contain the focus particle suggest that this particle implies
past tense as well. A case of this type is given in (210):(210)    u’ko    kwey loj-na=u          kis               sapato=u
         PRO.m FOC wash-DR=m ART.pl.a                     shoe=m

which exclude a past-tense reading. This can be seen when other tense particles or adverbial
clauses are involved. The three following examples are marked for future tense, incompatible
with the past-tense particle kwey, which implies the occurrence of an event before the moment
of speaking. Here, the form kwey can only represent the focus particle kaw. In (211), the
particles nokowa ‘right now’ (cf. 12.2.4) and loy ‘intentional’ (cf. 12.3.2) indicate future
tense:272(211)    jay e nokowa        loy ney=s           imay-ni,

should be obvious to the hearer, or an aspectual particle indicating the single repetition of an
event. This is the case when the context allows an interpretation like ‘again’, as in (134):(134)   ban kas rey nan-a-ra:-wa--us                          rey

When appearing before a main verb, the particle loy indicates that the speaker intends to and
is about to carry out the action denoted by the verb. This is shown by the following examples.(135)   dokoy, loy in         aj<a>lo:maj os              jeya=is

implying a more distant future, as in (139).(139)   n-as        son-tino:na’ loy i            sal-na
        obl-ART.n other-year        ITN 1         search-DR

when there is an additional indicator of future, such as the adverbial clause in (139), the
particle loy is not obligatory. The following is a perfectly acceptable alternative to the
utterance in (139) above:(140)   n-as        son-tino:na’      i    sal-na
        obl-ART.n other-year          1    search-DR
        ‘Next year I will look for (you).’                                {EA 8, 019r}Crucially, the intentional particle loy does not occur inside an NP. There is another,
homophonous particle, which only occurs in relative clauses and subordinate clauses (i.e.,
NPs with nominalized predicates), where it serves as a negator (cf. 12.5.2 below). It is not
clear whether these two particles are related.

        ‘Because now the fiesta may perhaps still be going on.’    {EA, Summary 020}The particle joy is often combined with other modal particles, for example with choy
‘certainly’, which indicates a higher degree of certainty on the part of the speaker (cf. 12.3.4
below).
  Often, joy is part of a conditional clause introduced by di’ (cf. 12.1.5 above):(145)   di’    joy jayna        koro’      man-cho,

The particle choy indicates that the speaker is certain of the truth of the statement. This
particle never appears alone, but is either preceded by the speculative particle joy (cf. 12.3.3)
or followed by rey (cf. 12.3.1), or it occurs between these particles. In combination with joy, it
indicates that the speaker does not know for sure, but assumes that what s/he is saying is true.
This can be seen in the following examples:(147)   che joy choy         ji:yi--’ne
        and SPC certainly cry.MD--f
        ‘And she must have cried.’                                {EA, Escape Marivel 042}(148)   joy choy       sul- e          is      monlo:to n-as           risa<kwa:~>kwa

        ‘My earrings must have got caught in my hair [because I lost one].’ {EA, Aros 037}
528
Possibly, the combination of these two particles is best seen as a single form, joychoy. This is
suggested by the following example, where the ending -ka, which creates the long form of
many particles, is added to this sequence:(149)       pay’-na=is        n-is        jayson jaleya:-bun,        bereya:-bun

            ‘They smeared (it) with what seemed like a syrup, tar probably.’ {EA, Parabas 019}When choy is followed (in very few cases, preceded) by rey (cf. 12.3.1 above), this
combination is best translated as ‘of course’. It is often used as an interjection when listening
to someone, as in (152).270(150)       bo        kaj rey pawa-n-e -wa=sne                              choy      rey

2.4.    Assimilation of nasals
The alveolar nasal phoneme /n/ always assimilates to the following consonant with respect to
its place of articulation: it is realized as [m] before a bilabial consonant and as [ ] before a
velar consonant. This can be represented as follows:(98)    /n/       [m]   / __ C [+bilabial]
                  [ ]   / __ C [+velar]The behaviour of /n/ before different consonants is illustrated in (99)a–c:(99)    a. /'ento/          [' nt ]          ‘to stand obliquely’
        b. /'enpoh/         [' mp h]         ‘to be made stand’
        c. /'enki/          ['  ki]          ‘Stand up!’Some speakers realize /n/ as [ ] in coda position when the following onset consonant is /n/ as
well (cf. (100)). This dissimilation signals syllable boundaries.(100)   /'enna/ [' nna] ~ ['    na] ‘where I stand’Unlike /n/, the bilabial nasal, /m/, does usually not assimilate to its environment. In (101)a, it
occurs before the alveolar, and in (101)b, before the velar plosive:(101)   a. /rim'tik/           [ im'ti i]    ‘to do the shopping’
        b. /'amki/             [' amki]      ‘Come in!’In the speech of some speakers, however, /m/ is realized as a velar nasal before a velar
consonant, as in (102). Here, /m/ is indistinguishable from /n/.(102)   /'amki/    [' a ki] ‘Come in!’As far as assimilation is concerned, the nasalized coda allophone of /t/, [t n] (cf. 2.3.1),
behaves in the same way as the alveolar nasal phoneme /n/: [t n] is realized as [p m] before a
bilabial consonant and as [k ] before a velar consonant. Hence, the syllable-final variants of
/t/ are as follows:34
(103)   /t/      [p m] / __ .C [+bilabial]
                 [k ] / __ .C [+velar]
                 [t n] / __ . (elsewhere)The realization of /t/ as a nasalized stop with simultaneous bilabial and velar closure,
respectively, is shown in (104)a and b:(104)   a. /tat' o:se /      [tap m' :s ]        ‘to fall down’
        b. /'batki/          [' ak ki]           ‘Get seated (on top of something)!’Note that in cases such as (104)a, the distinction between /t/ and /p/ is neutralized. In contrast,
/t/ does not become identical with /k/ before a velar consonant (cf. (104)b), since /k/ is
realized as a simple glottal stop and not accompanied by a velar closure.
   In cases such as (104)a, where the phonemic distinction between /t/ and /p/ is neutralized,
the underlying phoneme can be identified when a vowel-initial morpheme is attached to it (cf.
also 2.3.1 above, examples (63)–(69)). In this way, example (105) shows that the morpheme
realized as [p m] in (104) is, in fact, /t/:(105)    /tata' o:se /     [tata'   :s ]       ‘I make X fall down.’
2.5.    Nasalization of vowels
Nasalization of vowels is not a phonemic phenomenon. Progressive nasal assimilation can
occur when the following consonant is a nasal, as in (106), or a nasalized stop, as in (107):(106)   /be'benkwa/      [ '    kwa]         ‘hide, leather’
(107)   /bu'butkwa/      [ u' uk kwa]        ‘mud’Only one word contains nasal vowels which are not followed by a nasal or nasalized
consonant:(108)   /ho:'hok/        [h :'h     ]        ‘yes’This interjection is often pronounced with closed lips, so that the vowels are replaced by a
syllabic nasal consonant:(109)   [hm:'hm m]                           ‘yes’
                                                                                                35
2.6.    Aspiration of /s/ and / /
The phoneme /s/ can be realized as [h] in coda position. This only concerns the final
consonant of the articles (cf. 4.4), shown in (110)a for the article /as/, and of the negative
particle /kas/ (cf. 12.5), shown in (110)b.(110)   a. /as        'pa:ko/                       b. /kas     'hojwa/
           ART.n dog                                   NEG go:NMZ
           [ as 'pa:k ] ~ [ ah 'pa:k ]                 [kas 'h jwa] ~ [kah 'h jwa]
           ‘the/a dog’                                 ‘I don’t go.’The variation of [s] and [h] in these morphemes depends on the speaker. Some speakers
consistently pronounce them with a final [h], unless they precedes a word starting in [s] or
[t ]. In (111), this is shown for the article /is/ before the word /t i'na a/ ‘manioc’:(111)   /is t i'na a/    [ is t i'na a]               ‘(the) manioc’Other speakers pronounce these words with a final [s] in all environments.
  The fact that /s/ and /h/ are otherwise phonemically distinct in coda position, was shown by
the minimal pair in (37) above, which is repeated here:(112)   /as' aba /      [ as' a a ]       ‘to sit on the ground’
        /ah' aba /      [ ah' a a ]       ‘to go by foot’The phoneme / / is also often realized as [h]. This is particularly the case when it constitutes
the proclitic marking the first person (cf. 4.1). The phoneme / / is often realized as [h] when
the proclitic occurs before a relational noun (cf. Ch. 6) or before a bivalent verb. These cases
are illustrated by (113) and (114), respectively. In both cases, the first person is implicit and
therefore not necessarily overtly encoded (cf. 6.1 and 7.4).(113)   /a       'de:na/
        ART.n.1 lie:DR
        [ a ' :na] ~ [ ah '       :na]
        ‘my bed’(114)   /i 'salna/
        1 search:DR
        [ i 'salna] ~ [ ih 'salna]
        ‘I look for something.’However, /h/ and / / are phonemically distinct. This becomes apparent when a non-relational
noun with a first person singular possessor, as in (115)a, is contrasted with an unpossessed
non-relational noun, as in (115)b (cf. also 6.3):

dependent, the alternation between [ ] and [h] seems to be a rapid-speech phenomenon. In
careful speech, all speakers pronounce the first person proclitic as [ ].","[57, 58, 59, 60]"

3.7.3. Bivalent voice marking
The bivalent voice markers (cf. 8.1.1 and 8.1.2) may be replaced by a reduplication prefix
when the verb is further augmented, e.g. by the nominalizing suffix -wa. The direct marker
-na (cf. (81)a) is optionally replaced by a CV-reduplication prefix (cf. (81)b; cf. also (73)
above). When an inverse verb, marked by -kay in affirmative main clauses (cf. Ch. 8), is
further augmented, it undergoes prefixing bimoraic reduplication (cf. (82) and (74) and (75)
above).(81)    a. n-as        sal-na-wa   ~ b. n-as        sa~sal-wa

        obl-ART.n INV~search-NMZ
        ‘when X looks for me’The following text example illustrates the different voice-marking functions of CV- and
bimoraic reduplication on a nominalized verb base. In (83)a and c, CV-reduplication indicates
the direct voice, while the bimoraic reduplication in (83)b (causing gemination here) indicates
inverse voice.(83)    a. kas ye~yey-wa             as         ney-ni:-wa,      majni,

           ‘… and I don’t like (her) either.’                           {EA, Asilo 089-091}When an inverse verb has a longer base, it undergoes infixing CV-reduplication when a
further suffix is attached. This occurs, for example, when the verb has a disyllabic root, as in
(84), or when it is morphologically complex, as in (85). In the case of a direct verb with a
longer base, the marker -na is retained, as will be shown in 8.7.2.(84)    a. purun-kay
           kiss-INV
           ‘X kisses me.’
                                                                                             87

           obl-ART drive-DR-cow-<INV~>CAU-NMZ
           ‘when X makes me drive cattle’Interestingly, when the inverse base has a disyllabic root, it can also undergo prefixing
bimoraic reduplication, although this is rare. This means that the first two CV-sequences are
reduplicated. The form in (86) is semantically equivalent to (84) above:(86)    n-as       puru~purun-wa
        obl-ART.n INV~kiss-NMZ
        ‘when X kisses me’Examples (87)a and b are another illustration of the equivalence of the word form with the
CV-infix and the bimoraic prefix:(87)     a. n-os        de<wa~>waj-wa
            obl-ART.n.p see<INV~>-NMZ
       ~ b. n-os        dewa~dewaj-wa

            ‘when X saw me’                                                  {EC 16, 282}Based on the fact that bimoraic prefixing reduplication occurs not only with monosyllabic, but
also with longer roots, as in (86) and (87) above, it can be assumed that this type of
reduplication is the basic means of forming an inverse base for action nominalization, and that
infixing reduplication is a later development. In the case of disyllabic roots, such as purun-
‘kiss’ in (84) and (86) above, or dewaj- ‘see’ in (87) above, phonological reduction of the
third syllable may have led to an infixing interpretation. This possible development is
illustrated in (88)a–c, with the root represented in bold-face:(88)    a. puru~purun-wa
           INV~kiss-NMZ
        b. puru~run-wa
           INV~kiss-NMZ
        c. pu<ru~>run-wa
           kiss<INV~>-NMZ
           ‘X kissing me’
88
Subsequently, the infixing process may have been extended to more complex bases such as in
(85).
  The three reduplication processes involved in the voice marking of morphologically
augmented verbal bases are summed up in (89) (VB = verb base, = mora, = syllable):(89)        -na        CV~        / VB     __ NMZ              ‘DR’            -kay          ~   / VB ( ) __ NMZ                  ‘INV’

Depending on the semantic properties of the base, it can also denote an undergoer. In the
following example, -pa occurs on a verb that denotes a process whose only participant is an
undergoer. Accordingly, the noun derived through -pa denotes the undergoer:(40)        che werel-ni os           powlo, che kas rey werel-ni-<pa~>pa=as

but can also function as the predicate of an affirmative main clause, as in most of the above

The particle jan introduces an adverbial clause, which is formally an oblique NP (cf. 7.12.3).
The special property of this construction is that the predicate of the adverbial clause is not
nominalized through -wa or reduplication (cf. 11.1.1), but through a suffix -na, which only
occurs in this particular construction (cf. 11.1.3). Consider the following example:(37)     jan     n-os         tes-na=sne,           bo       jayna rey
         CSQ obl-ART.n.p limp-NMZ.CSQ=f.a REAS DSC again

         ‘That’s why she limped, because her thigh was broken here.’ {EA, Ay’ku I 011}
508
Often, a clause containing jan is preceded by the particle bo ‘because’. This does not seem to
influence the meaning.(38)    bo        jan     n-os           jisa-na-na=is          enona=y’ i

12.1.8. The preposition o:be ‘like’
The particle o:be precedes an NP or a pronoun which denotes an entity with which another
entity is compared. Unlike the subordinating particles described above (e.g. bo ‘so that’), the
NP preceded by o:be typically contains not a nominalized predicate, but an ordinary noun.
This particle is therefore best described as a preposition.
  In (42), o:be introduces a noun phrase, in (43) a free pronoun, and in (44) a demonstrative
(underlined):(42)    wurul-che --as o:be           is       bana:ma

        ‘The door was like that one [half-open].’                        {EA, Escape 038}In (45) below, the NP following the particle o:be contains a nominalized predicate. This
clause qualifies the predicate of the preceding clause (tivijniwa ‘hurting’), which is itself an
adverbial clause of the type described in 7.12.3.(45)    asko      n-os          jayna tivij-ni-wa=os                dimpoj-a=sne

12.2.     Tense and aspect particles
It is not easy to distinguish the categories tense, aspect and mood as indicated by particles.
Temporal and aspectual categories are difficult to distinguish, and some particles with an
aspectual function can also be used as markers of mood. Therefore, I subsume tense and
aspect particles under one heading, and some of them will be described again in the section on
modal and epistemic particles (12.3).
   The position of the TAM-particles in the clause, and the relation between their position and
their scope, requires further research. It seems that in principle, a particle can occur at any
