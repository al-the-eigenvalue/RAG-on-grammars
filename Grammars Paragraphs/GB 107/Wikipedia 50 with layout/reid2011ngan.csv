               -wurru is an enclitic that has the propositional function of indicating
        that the speaker finds either the proposition as a whole, or a particular
        element of the proposition, to be unsatisfactory. It expresses a negative
        evaluation of a proposition, or some entity's role in a proposition, because it
        impacts on the speaker in some disadvantageous way.
               Attached to adjectives and expressions of quantity -wurru apportions
        the unsatisfactoriness of the proposition to the excess of that attribute or
        quantity.               6-116    funggulu ngamban-nime,

be ‘self-directed’, but rather combines the semantic components of ‘heat’
and 'Go*, to mean 'to go along lighting fires’. eg.      4-293 ngimbineweny-karrbu         wurr

        Ngan'gityemerri speakers employ a system of nominal classification
that divides the nominal world into fifteen categories.           Section 5.1
examines the manner in which membership within these categories is
signalled, and section 5.2 deals with the semantics of these categories. 5.3
looks at the types of modifying element that can be classmarked. 5.4 details
the suffixation of class generics to minbe ‘negative’ and tyen ‘what'. Finally
section 5.5 examines the phonological status of the set of bound class
generics, which varies between proclitics and prefixes.","[312, 313]"
"7.11    Interjections
        Interjections differ from particles in their capacity to constitute
utterances on their own. They typically express a reaction to an event, either
linguistic or extra-linguistic (cf. Laughren 1982:132). Several of the particles
discussed in 7.1 to 7.10 function also as interjections. These include ngunu
(cf. 7.2), wetimbi (cf. 7.3), and tyamennaza (cf. 7.7).                     yes
       yi            oh yeah     (mild interest or tentative agreement)
       (a)ya         hey !

and quantification are expressed in Ngan'gityemerri.","[391, 392]"
"Here the possessive pronoun modifying tyulut -'hook spear’, bears the
‘tree/thing' class bound generic yerr- rather than the ‘bamboo spear’ class
bound generic yeli-. This shift in class allocation is motivated by focus upon
the spear, not as a piece of wood that is being used as a spear, but rather as a
piece of wood that is being mended in the way that other wooden objects
are.
        Similarly, the statement that one ‘has no matches’, using the negative
particle minbe- suffixed with a generic, could be given as either 5-97 or 5-98.       5-97   match minbe-yenggi
                      Neg - fire

                      Neg - tree
              I've got no matchesThat is, matches can be classified as ‘tree/things’ because they are pieces of
wood, or as ‘fire’ by virtue of their function. Most of the examples of
crossclassing in Ngan'gityemerri are facilitated by the potential to variously
view certain objects with respect to their ‘inherent nature’ or 'function/use'
features. This suggests that the classes of wooden implements ‘bamboo
spears’, 'canegrass spears’, ‘hand held weapons’, 'woomeras', and ‘digging
sticks', could usefully be organised hierachically as sub-classes of yawurr
‘tree/things'. Higher level classification as yawurr is based on ‘inherent
nature’ features, whereas lower level classification as yawul, kurum, syiri,
tyiny or kini, is based on 'function/use' features.",[339]

                         There are examples where the structural pattern of prohibitives is
                  sometimes found to express inability without necessarily the implication of
                  prohibition from some external source. As in English and many other
                  languages, the distinction between these different senses of the deontic
                  mode is not encoded morphologically.                            6-84   ngayi wa-mirrisyarra-ngi

"        Although they generally pattern with the nominal and verbal
enclitics, nyine and kana (K) have the capacity to occur as independent

        In 6.2.6 I describe the use of -gumu as a semblative enclitic to
nominals. -Gumu additionally functions, in a completely unrelated sense,
as a marker of progressive/incompletive aspect. In this capacity -gumu
functions at clause level, i.e. having scope over the entire clause, not merely
the constituent that happens to host it. As noted for other clause level
enclitics, -gumu can either select the verb as its host, or may appear on
negatives, interrogatives, or verbal arguments that immediately precede the
verb.
        As a marker of progressive/incompletive aspect -gumu interacts
differently with the modal categories realis and irrealis. In the two realis
incompletive mood/aspect auxiliary inflectional categories, Present and Past
IMPerfective, -gumu denotes a subordinate clause as the temporal frame for
a main clause. To employ the terms used by Chung and Timberlake (1985),
-gumu designates the clause over which it has scope, as the ‘event frame’
with respect to ‘which the main clause proposition is evaluated.        The ‘event
frame’ is progressive/incompletive and therefore designates an interval of
time.   The main clause predicate, which must be a telic, perfective verb, falls
within this temporal frame. This construction type, where an imperfective
clause subordinated by -gumu serves as the temporal frame for a perfective
main clause, is exemplified in the examples below. In 3-202 and 3-203 the
-gumu subordinated predicate is in the Past IMPerfective, and in 3-204 it is
in the Present. Both these auxiliary inflectional categories are inherently
progressive.          3-202 winni -ngiti-ngidi-gumu -tye,                  taya wunungeriny         -wurity

     Structure of Examples
              Examples are structured as four lines. The first line is the
     Ngan'gityemerri sentence/word in bold script. Loanwords are treated in
     one of two ways. English loans which essentially retain their English
     phonemicisation and meaning are given in the first line of examples in
     plain rather than bold script, to denote their status as loan words (or in some
     cases, code-switching). Loans from English which have been phonemicised

     loanwords are given in bold script and provided with an interlinear gloss on
     lines two and three (i.e. in accordance with Ngan'gityemerri speakers’
     perception of such words, I have treated them as ‘proper NgK or NgW’).
     The second and third lines of examples, in italic script, provide an
     interlinear gloss. I've found the use of two lines necessary simply because of
     the morphological density of the verb in particular. Lines 2 and 3 are meant
     to be read jointly from left to right, rather than sequentially. For instance,
     the gloss to the example given below should be read as;                    wuddumbuny-ngerr -mi -wul        -nime-pagu
                    3pl Shove   -dl/1sg-Val-return- tr | -HITH

     dual subject and first singular direct object, valence increaser, return (verb
     root), trial subject, hither directional”
              As evident in the above example, I use a slash / between the glossed
     elements of a portmanteau morpheme.          Another minor convention is the
     inclusion, below the verb root, of the meaning of the verb. This is given
     only in those verbs whose meaning is unpredictable from the combination
     of the auxiliary and verb root semantics.
Se
              Auxiliary roots are glossed by name (e.g. 'Shove' in the example
     above). The semantic nature of auxiliary verbs is discussed in detail in
     chapter 5, and readers seeking explanation of auxiliary root glosses are
     referred to this section. The 31 auxiliary names are listed below.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"
"        The ‘unsatisfactory’ evaluation of a proposition (or, more especially,
an individual's role in a proposition), that is convey by -wurru, can interact
with the semantics of the verb and the general context of the discourse in a
way that leads to the interpretation of the speech act as an expression of
compassion or an expression of criticism. For instance, a -wurru marked NP
that is portrayed as the victim of some verb of adverse effect, as in 6-122, is
understood to be the object of the speaker's compassion. On the other hand,
a-wurru marked NP that is portrayed as the perpetrator of some adverse
proposition (or even potentially adverse proposition), is understood to be
the object of the speaker's criticism, as in 6-123.      6-122 minbe-wurru           kene          yannunggu-madiwirri

phonological words, and generally occurring clause-initially. Otherwise they
share broadly similar semantic functions to the enclitics discussed in the
preceding chapter. Wilkins (1989:347) has drawn attention to the ‘significant
degree of agreement between the stocks of meanings encoded through the
particle/clitic grouping’ in Australian languages generally. Most of the
particles discussed here have scope over an entire clausal proposition. The
three forms examined in 7.10 have the function of conjoining nouns and
clauses under certain, fairly limited, conditions. Particles cannot take any
form of inflection. 7.11 lists the class of interjections, which differ from
particles in constituting complete utterances on their own.","[382, 383]"

Note that in their preverbal positioning manner adverbs may be
indistinguishable- from qualitative adjectives. To example 1 above therefore,
we can add another possible translation -'He's telling the story properly’.
        Particles, treated in chapter 7, generally precede the particular -
construction over which they have operational scope. They are normally
ineligible for any kind of nominal or verbal inflection, however clause
initially the negative particle minbe/minde(K) frequently attracts such
verbal enclitics as the temporal focus marker -nyine/-kana(K) and the past
and future tense markers, -tye and -pe/ -ngini(K). 6 b) is therefore an
acceptable equivalent of 6 a).      6 a)   minbe ngambani-nyine-pe        b)   minbe-nyine-pe         ngambani

"5.4     Noun Class Generics with Tyen- ‘what’ and Minbe- ‘negative’.
        Noun class generics can be combined with tyen- ‘what’. The
combination of tyen and class marker X, asks 'what kind of X class member
is this ?'. Tyen- has been found to combine with the ‘animal’, 'plantfood',
‘tree’ and ‘bodypart/country (see 5.2.4)' generics. As listed in 5-126, it is the
degenerate bound generics of the ‘'plantfood', ‘animal’ and
‘bodypart/country’         classes that combine         with    tyen-, but the freeform

 system as a whole, it seems most likely that these bound generics developed
 as proclitics to both class member and modifying nominals. This pattern is
 still manifested among the first group, and is true for group two modifiers.
 However the attachment of group two bound generics to class members
 appears to have undergone de-cliticisation, their reanalysis as prefixes
evidenced by a shift to phonological dependency on the root that is manifest
 by both the generic's capacity to bear stress marking and to undergo vowel
 harmony rules etc.

"1.5     Fieldwork Methodology and Grammar Writing
1.5.1   Getting started
        In 1981 I had just completed a Batchelor degree in linguistics, and
found myself inspired by one of Bob Dixon's courses in Aboriginal
linguistics to do some real fieldwork of my own. Wary of committing
myself to a post-graduate course, I canvassed around the ANU linguistics
department to find someone who I could accompany on their fieldtrip. This
I felt would satisfy my curiosity, giving me a taste of fieldwork, and at the
same time leave me in a position that I could back out of, if need be. Ian
Green took me up on my enthusiastic but completely deceitful promises to
cook, do the washing, and write up his paradigms and verb cards etc, and
took me to the Daly on the first of his Ph.D fieldtrips. Ian was learning
Marrithiyel from Bill Parry, so we ended up in Bill's camp on the west side
of the Daly river. Three elderly women in Bill's camp (including his wife)20Several of the features of New Ngan‘gikurunguurr that are mentioned here, including this
function of -gimin (H&K 1988:219), can be found in Hoddinott and Kofod's grammar of
Ngankikurungkurr. Their main informant is a ‘school generation’ New Ngan’gikurunggurr

widely around most of the NgW estates, combining jobs like hunting and
collecting ochres/firewood with some site-mapping, fulfilling Robert's
custodial role in certain estates, and the odd bit of fishing. Patrick Tyabada
frequently accompanied us on these trips, contributing his own stories and
general hilarity. While the bulk of my NgW data comes from a small
number of informants, I have regularly tested its acceptability within the
wider community of NgW speakers (see acknowledgements).
        Most of the Peppi community took an interest in my developing
language skills, making an effort to avoid speaking English to me, and
randomly testing my knowledge of words and expressions.               My more
spectacular errors (quite unrepeatable) featured regularly in community
gossip. This level of interest, though occasionally embarrassing, greatly
improved my conversational fluency in NgW.
        From the start Ngan'gityemerri people have always been keen to
have their language ‘written down’.           Although I have always been
encouraged by this expression of support, initially I felt uneasy about what
seemed to be two unstated inferences: that the language would somehow be
saved by this process, and secondly that my thesis would constitute some
sort of language resource that they could refer to like a dictionary. My
explanations of what my thesis would and would not be, produced varied
responses. Some people were plainly puzzled; if I was not producing a
resource for native speakers, or drills for language learners, just who would
use this book ? Others were quick to point out my obligations to make
available those products of my work that were of more immediate use, texts
and wordlists particularly.
       At Peppimenarti I was actively encouraged to work in the school, and
together with Terry Sam began a school-based language program. Although
we did develop and teach the orthography used here and commence
wordlists for each child, the main focus of this program has always been on
different ‘languages’.  Within a single ‘language’, people listening to a narrative will, in
whisper, query the acceptability of unusual auxiliary(+bodypart)+verbroot combinations,
and derisively hoot at erroneous or implausible ones. Within this context, my discussions
with informants about the acceptability of particular grammatical constructions, was not
considered particularly odd by them. Of course the responses I got were subject to all sorts of
variables, and where these were    uncontrollable, I have avoided relying on this material at
all, unless natural contexts could verify them. So while much of the description contained in
this thesis is based on the grammar of narrative text, and most of the examples cited are
taken from recorded texts, my understanding of such issues as bodypart incorporation and
auxiliary semantics in particular, owes a significant debt to the process of solid formal
elicitation.
fostering oral rather than written language skills. The school has been
building a collection of video resources, with the assistance of the National
Aboriginal Languages Program, that one day may be ‘patched in’ to local
television transmission.
1.5.3 Approach to Grammar Writing
        My approach to writing a grammar of Ngan'gityemerri falls fairly
squarely within the traditions of what Wilkins (1989:58) has referred to as
‘The ANU School of Australian Grammatical Description’. This tradition
places a high priority on the use of descriptive practices that best reflect the
linguistic system in question, and are sensitive to the cultural context of its
usage. Grammars written within this tradition are highly eclectic in their
use of linguistic theory, drawing on whatever grammatical tools best
achieve these descriptive aims, without being overly concerned about, as
Evans (1985:xii) puts it, ""whether they all come from the same toolkit"".
Writers within this tradition employ, and acknowledge their use of,
whatever theories best handle the particular aspect of the language they are
describing. At the same time they are wary of 'fad’ theoretical terminology,
believing that a grammatical description written in the most straightforward
language and containing a large number of natural language examples will
best allow the reader to judge the accuracy and internal consistency of the
description.
        I began this description of Ngan’gityemerri with the intention of
providing a full reference grammar of the language. I have been forced to
reduce the scope of this work by the realisation that languages having such
morphological density as this one does, cannot be adequately treated within
the thesis wordlength limitations imposed by the university. This thesis
cannot really be called a ‘grammar’, for it does not adequately cover some
aspects of the language, and others not at all. I have given fairly detailed
descriptions of the phonology and nominal and verbal morphology. As this
is a language in which the verb is “where the action is"", I have further
chosen to explore two of the most interesting aspects of the verb; the
incorporation of bodypart terms into the verbal complex, and the semantics
of the auxiliary verbs.","[48, 49, 50, 51]"

as in most parts of the country, the Aboriginal perception of ‘language’?
names and relationships are not necessarily based on distinctive linguistic
attributes (Dixon 1980:43).   For the purposes of this grammar, I have used
the name Ngan'gityemerri to represent this linguistically defined language.
This should be clearly understood to be a linguistic abstraction of my own
2 I distinguish between linguistically defined language, and Aboriginally defined ‘language’,
by placing the latter in quotaton marks.
Note also that the practice of forming ‘language’ names through a compound with the word
for ‘language’, does not in any convincing way suggest that the primary reference of these
names is to language rather than people. This is a region where languages are spoken in
continous blocs of country. If you know someone's country, then you know their language, and
vice versa.    Within this environment, names that formally define languages, also define
their collective speakers and the country they belong to.

"The type of strictly syntactic incorporation presented here shows different
characteristics to the incorporation in languages discussed by Mithun (1984).
Using Mohawk as an example, she argues that all predicates bearing
incorporated nouns are lexicalised, regardless of how productive the process
may be.
                       "" NI may appear to be a syntactic process simply because of its tremendous
                       productivity; the number of combinations that occur seems unlimited.
                       However, speakers are keenly aware of the lexical status of all such
                       combinations. They know not only which constructions are possible, but also
                       which    of        these   actually   exist--ie.    which      are    lexicalised.        They
                        immediately recognise those which are not.                     Speakers           immediately
                       remember who uses a word not used by others, even when it is a perfectly
                       transparent combination of two highly productive stems.”                 |
                                 $              Having made this claim that speakers of incorporating languages remember
              all combinations of 'incorporated noun + verb’ as a lexicalised unit, Mithun
              uses this as a basis to draw a distinction between noun incorporation and
              other truly . syntactic processes. Speakers of non-incorporating languages,
              she argues, do not remember all possible combinations of verb and object.
                      Although            any     claims     about        the     degree      of          lexicalisation     of

 Bey
            _ impressionistic,
                             the examples like those in 3-275 a) - e) above suggest that in
              Ngan'gityemerri at least, bodypart incorporation can be a purely syntactic
              process. In fact Mithun indirectly acknowledges this possibility in the
              discrepancy between “constructions which are possible, and those that
              actually exist -ie. which are lexicalised""(loc. cit.). In Ngan'gityemerri,
              bodypart-verb root combinations that ‘exist’ (ie. are lexicalised) can be
              negatively tested for in terms of the criteria productivity and optionality.
              Likewise those combinations that do not ‘exist’, in the sense that they are
              not lexicalised, can be distinguished by their full syntactic productivity.
              There seems to be no real basis to say of these types, as Mithun does, that "" If
              speakers use a new combination, they are creating a new word and are aware
              of the fact"" (loc. cit.).
                     It should be pointed out that this distinction between syntactic and
             lexical incorporation in Ngan'gityemerri is purely based on the grammatical
             criteria of productivity and optionality. No attempt has been made to draw
             lines,   based     on         the    intuitions      of      native      speakers,            between       those
             combinations that 'exist' and those which do not. My own experience of
             exploring the productiveness of bodypart incorporation with informants
             suggests that no such clearcut lines exist. The degree of productivity
             brought to the incorporation of bodyparts is a stylistic variable that some
             speakers exploit more than others.      Combinations which are rejected
             outright as not ‘existing’, can always be found to ‘exist’ where a sufficiently
             imaginative       mind         can establish a plausible context.                            In fact it is the
exploitation of the more marginal ‘non-existent’ combinations        that is
widely held to be the mark of someone who is ‘good with words’.
       Variation in the perception of the degree of lexicalisation of some
combinations would be anticipated if the incorporation of bodyparts is an
evolving process.     This is particularly true where, as Mithun notes,
lexicalisation develops from noun + verb combinations that are, in cultural
terms, especially nameworthy.
       Lexical    incorporation,   on   the other    hand,   differs   from   syntactic
incorporation in not being productive. While there are many instances of
the same verb root compounding lexically with different bodypart terms, as
in 3-282, this is not to be confused with productiveness. Lexical
incorporation is a compounding process that derives a new verb root from
the combination of a bodypart and a verb root. (eg. Bodypart - Verb root 1 ->
Verb root 2).       3-282 a)       ngibem-tyeri-baty (*detyeri)

5The generic mipurs/yedi (K) ‘man’ can also used at a higher taxonomic level to denote
‘person’. Thus ‘no-one’, in the gender unspecified sense, can be expressed by minbe-mipurr.
However fela, from English ‘fellow’ via Kriol, has been borrowed into Ngan’gityemerri as a
gender unspecified third term.

        The paradigm is typical of pronominal systems in Daly region
languages, and within prefixing languages generally, in its range of number
categories, and in the restriction of the gender distinction to the 3rd singular
forms only (as is also true of the bound pronominal paradigm).
        However, the paradigm cannot be readily accounted for as a single
system. The lack of homogeneity in the categorisation and morphological
derivation of the 1st inclusive forms on the one hand, and the rest of the
paradigm, on the other, requires that each of these be treated as separate sub-
systems.
      Looking firstly at the non-Ist singular pronouns, there are three basic
number categories, singular, dual and plural. While dual may be a more
marked category than plural in discourse terms, there is no particular
morphological reason to view either the plural or dual forms as more basic.
A fourth highly marked category, trial, is derived by suffixing the dual form
with -nime.
       Among the Ist inclusive pronouns however, there are only two
number categories, there being no distinction between plural and trial. The
Ist inclusive plural/trial pronoun is derived morphologically by adding the
suffix -nime to the dual form. In this respect, viewed from the perspective
of the non-1st inclusive sub-paradigm, nayin-nime has the formal structure
of a trial form. However given the specifically plural reference of nayin-
nime, the suffix -nime has clearly different meanings within the two sub-
systems.
         This asymmetry between 1st inclusive and the rest of the paradigm,
has been noted in many prefixing languages. For some of these languages
this     asymmetry     is simply   the    result   of their      being   viewed   from   a
singular/dual/trial/plural perspective. For these languages re-analysis as a
minimal /augmented system has allowed the merging of two apparent sub-
systems into a single uniform one (see for instance the analysis of the
Rembarrnga pronominal system in McKay 1975). A list of languages
analysed as having minimal/augmented pronominal systems is given in
Dixon (1980:353).  Note though that treating the Idlinc pronoun as a
minimal unit does not resolve the asymmetry evident in the
Ngan'gityemerri pronominal paradigm.
       Pronouns in Ngan'gityemerri pattern with other nominal subclasses
in being independent forms that can bear local case suffixes, and host bound
class marking proclitics.       These capacities are demonstrated in 9-1 and 9-2

                                     Abstract           This thesis is a study of Ngan'gityemerri, a language spoken
  primarily in and around the two communities of Nauiyu Nambiyu and
  Peppimenarti in the Northern Territory.
           Chapter One provides an introduction to the names by which
  speakers of this language have been referred to, comments on the
  relationship between the two dialects, and establishes my use of the term
  Ngan'gityemerri as a language name. Also included in this chapter is a brief
  account of the history of these people since European invasion of their
  country began late last century, some comments on social organisation,
  cultural affiliations, Wangga and Lirrga songstyles, and a description of their
  country. The current status of the language is reviewed, and the language
  variety presented in this work is clearly identified. A survey of previous
  work on Ngan'gityemerri, and a description of my fieldwork methodology
  are additionally included.
           Chapter Two presents the segmental phonology, phonotactics, stress
  patterns and morphophonological processes. Particular attention, in the
  form of a detailed acoustic study, is given to the mechanism by which the
  contrast between two series of stops is maintained.
           Chapter Three presents an overview of ‘simple’ and 'complex' verb
  structures, then identifies the morphological make-up of the verbal
_elements labelled ‘auxiliary’ and ‘complex verb stem’. The mechanisms
  that interact to mark categories of tense, aspect and mood, namely auxiliary
 root inflection, verbal enclitics, verb root reduplication and the serialisation
 of posture/motion auxiliaries, are all addressed in this chapter. The
 incorporation into the verb of bodypart noun roots is also investigated here.
 A distinction between ‘lexical’ and ‘syntactic’ incorporation is invoked, and
 the differences in the effect of both these types of incorporation is dealt with.
 A list of incorporable terms is presented, and their literal and classificatory
 semantics explored.
          Chapter Four investigates the semantic contribution that the
 auxiliary makes to the meaning of a full verb. The 31 auxiliaries are broken
 down into six groups on the basis of their functional roles, which are
 described in detail.
          Chapter Five deals with the role played by both freeform and bound
 generics in classifying the Ngan'gityemerri nominal world. The
 morphology of these generics is surveyed with regard to the typological
 distinction drawn between ‘noun class’ systems on the one hand, and
‘classifier’ systems on the other. The semantics of noun class categories are
also examined here.
          Chapter Six examines the set of enclitics, some of which have scope
over NPs and others over clausal propositions. The semantic functions of
this clitic set vary widely, some marking such case-like roles as 'agent' or
‘instrument’, others encoding the kinds of meanings, like speaker attitude,
that are commonly attributed to free particles. The class of free particles is
treated in Chapter Seven.
          Chapter Eight provides a brief presentation of space, time and
number expression, and Chapter Nine deals with the freeform pronominal
system, demonstratives and interrogatives.
          Appendices to this grammar include the full subject-auxiliary
sequence paradigms for both Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr, as
well as four texts. Cassette tapes of the textual material included in the
appendices have been submitted with this thesis, and copies of these will
gladly be made available by the author to any interested readers.
                            Acknowledgments          Acknowledgments in theses tend to list personal debts after
 professional ones.     I'd like to make one of my personal debts most
 prominent, for the reason that neither language informants enduring
 laborious and uninsightful elicitation, nor supervisors plowing through
 copious draft chapters, make the personal sacrifice towards a Ph.D that one's
spouse does. Janet Douglas not only endured for four years the stresses
imposed by living below the poverty line, my prolonged absences on
fieldwork, and my preoccupation with topics beyond her own interests, but
at the same time bore our two children and developed her own art. She
skillfully trod the fine line between being totally supportive on the one
hand, and ensuring, on the other, that I understood that this had to finish. I
couldn't have done this without her.
         I'd like to express my gratitude to all the inhabitants of the
communities of Peppimenarti, Nauiyu Nambiyu and Wudi Gapil Diyerr for
the friendship and generosity they extended to me, for their tolerance of my
preoccupations and blunders, and for sharing with me their language and
way of life. To teach me NgW I have been particularly fortunate in being
commandeered by Robert Daly. Delighted to find a whitefella interested in
his language, he spent twelve months befriending me, teaching me, and
getting us both into trouble. As a gifted narrator, an enthusiastic and
perceptive polyglot, and a man with an extraordinary memory, he proved to
be an excellent teacher. He provided encouragement when needed, though
delighted in publicly chiding his ‘schoolboy’ , as he liked to call me. Widely
acknowledged as a superb didjeridu player, and master of a wide range of
song styles, he opened my eyes to the whole field of song language and
structure that my linguistic training had not prepared me to even consider
as ‘language’.
         Numerous other people at Peppimenarti have contributed towards
my understanding of Ngan'gityemerri, and been great friends. Special
thanks to Agala, Tyemeny, Tyarambu, Lunggu, Talungga, Wirigaty,
Maguraty, and Terry Sams.
         Molly Mafulenggit of Nauiyu Nambiyu checked my NgW data and
provided texts and data of her own, particularly with regard to zoological
and botanical taxonomy.
         Daisybell Malfiyin and Long Harry Barney also taught me some
NgW and confirmed the Laves' data as the Ngan'gimerri of rak-Merren.
Long Harry recorded for me his entire song repertoire.
           Patrick Tyabada provided some entertaining NgW texts, and was
 invaluable in site mapping rak-Lafuganying. And thanks to Old Tilmarr
 who gave me his sweat.
           My NgkK teachers were initially the late Topsy Parry, the late Mabel
 Kada, and Margaret Parry of Nawiyu Nambiyu and Wudi Gapil Diyerr.
 Later they included Martin Padu, Pincher McCann, Paul Tyekpity and
 Stephen Kundu of Peppimenarti, and Topsy Waya of Nauiyu Nambiyu.
           Harry Wilson, king of Peppimenarti, doubled the productiveness of
 my time there by ensuring that I never experienced the sense of security that
 might lead one to slacken off. At the same time he was generous with
accommodation      and supportive of my work. To him and Regina I'm very
 grateful.
           My entire time in the field was spent under the ‘parental’ guidance
 of Bill Parry, who always kept an eye out for me, introduced me to potential
 informants, kept me informed of local political developments, and was
 always ready with a cup of tea and a dirty story.
           At Daly River Mission Joseph Parry, Dianne Tchumut and
 Angganmerr have been terrific friends, and the Nauiyu Nambiyu council
 and mission staff have always been most kind to me, providing
 accommodation and other support when neccesary. At Peppimenarti the
 successive headmasters David Shute and Tony Crichton were always
 enthusiastic about my work and encouraged me to spend time teaching in
 the school. Other European staff at Peppi, Sue Crichton, Michelle Spencer,
 Kim   O'Donnell,   Kerry   Green,   Angelita   Martini,   and   Ruth   and   Glenn
 Rogers, provided an entertaining alternative social life, numerous
 kindnesses, and some fabulous meals. Visits to Peppi by Alan Marett during
 my 1988 fieldtrip first got me interested in the structure and language of
 song, and I enjoyed our joint investigations into these topics immensely.
          My interest in Australian linguistics was first fired by Bob Dixon, and
 as my main supervisor he was thorough and always encouraging. Harold
 Koch provided additional supervision, particularly with the final draft. I'm
 greatly indebted to Ian Green. He not only provided me with the
 opportunity to first engage in fieldwork, but discussions with him over the
 subsequent years and his detailed comments of early drafts, have
 significantly shaped my analysis of Ngan'gityemerri. Mark Harvey has
 proved to be a thorough commentator, and made numerous suggestions for
 improvements, particularly in the phonology chapter and the section on
 bodyparts. For additional comments on various parts of this grammar I'm
 grateful to Felix Ameka, Andy Butcher, Anne Dineen, Nick Evans, Phil
Rose, David Wilkins and particularly to Nick Piper who did the last minute
typo hunt.
        Alison Hoddinott and Frances Kofod graciously allowed me access to
the Hoddinott and Kofod grammar whilst it was still in preparation for
publication.
        In Canberra Ian Green, Nick Piper, Felix Ameka and Andy Butcher
forced me to drink four years of bad coffee, but also kept me sane. Thanks.
       Numerous    other friends   including   Pete   & Jay, Bill & Paul,    and
especially Alison & Dave, have been unstinting in their support.
         Fieldwork funding was provided by the ANU Faculties. The
AIATSIS kindly provided me with a vehicle for the '86 fieldtrip. When I
ungraciously wrote this off, Warwick Dix was extremely helpful in finding a
replacement vehicle for me.      For my '88 fieldtrip the AIATSIS again
provided funds which enabled me to hire a vehicle from NARU                 (who
additionaliy helped out with camping equipment).

translation. I've been fairly free with translations, attempting, in addition to
an accurate rendition, to convey something of the speech style. To this end,
in a few cases I have translated using expressions that are characteristic of
the English of Ngan'gityemerri speakers, but which may be less well known
in standard Australian English.
         The use of brackets ( ) in the fourth line of examples either provides
contextual information which is missing from the given example, but
established within the wider discourse, or clarifies implications of the
example. e.g. I brought it for her (to give to her), (on her behalf), (at her
request) etc. A bracketed sentence below the line-4 translation is an
alternative translation.
         Example numbers are of the form 3-56, where 3 denotes the chapter
number, and 56 denotes the example number within that chapter. Examples
in each chapter are renumbered from 1. Ngan'gikurunggurr examples are
marked by 'NgK’ below the example number. All examples not designated
as NgK should be understood to be Ngan'giwumirri, unless specified in the
text as some other language.

"      In their copula functions ‘sit’, ‘lie’, ‘stand’ 'go' and ‘go* are used to
encode the existence/location of, or ascribe attributes to their subjects.
‘Existential’ clauses are simply statements about the existence of entities
with respect to space and time. 'Ascriptive’ clauses employ the simple
intransitive auxiliaries to ascribe certain characteristics to their subjects.
These characteristics can be expressed as either adjectives or through
attributive NP's. As copulas ‘sit’, ‘lie’, ‘stand’, 'go' and ‘go*' are used for
both inanimate and animate subjects, necessitating a rather broader view of
each posture.       The discussion of posture below is exemplified with
existential clauses.
       In addition to animates that are in an obviously prone/supine
posture, any inanimate that is not raised off the ground, and is conceived of

      Hoddinott and Kofod collected a vast amount of data on primarily
NgK, but also NgW, between 1967 and 1982. Hoddinott was preparing a
grammar of NgK at the time of his death in late 1984. Kofod carried on with
the project and a grammar entitled 'The Ngankikurungkurr Language (Daly
River Area, Northern Territory)’ (Pacific Linguistics, Series D, No. 77), was
published in 1988, My analysis of this language differs from their work in
numerous ways (some minor, some major). It is not possible to provide a
thorough critique of the Hoddinott and Kofod analysis within this thesis.
Consequently, although I've made occasional reference to their work at
appropriate places through the text (usually as footnotes), no attempt has
been made to rigorously defend my analyses in view of their previous work.
To indicate the nature of the difficulties with their analysis, a rather ad hoc
selection of four points is given below.
        - H&K do not acknowledge that the speech variety they describe is a
mixture of the more traditional language of older speakers and the modern
variety that I call New-Ngan'gikurunggurr (see 1.4.2.)
        - H&K's phonology chapter is clearly a jumbled collation of
competing draft analyses. Kofod acknowledges in the preface that she had
the difficult task of producing a final draft from assorted earlier versions.
However her claim to have done so is not borne out in the text.           In the
discussion of stop consonants, for example, successive paragraphs jump
unannounced from a 'voice' analysis to a ‘length’ analysis. The claim (p 10)
that “voiced and voiceless phonemes contrast initially and medially"" is
followed (p 11) by the observation that ""stops are normally long in
medial...position"" (the latter claim suggestive of their being no contrast at
all).
        - Ngan’gityemerri is a head-marking language that obligatorily cross-
references core arguments on the verb with bound pronominal affixes. The
pattern of core argument crossreferencing is strictly nominative /accusative.
Both S and A arguments are cross-referenced by a single set of prefixes to the
auxiliary root. Arguments in O function are cross-referenced with another
set of suffixes to the auxiliary root. Hé&K claim that Ngan'gikurunggurr is
an ergative language (H&K 1988:205). They base their claim on the function
of -ninggi, an enclitic which attaches to nouns filling instrumental and
agentive roles. Having the primarily discourse function of clarifying agency,
-ninggi is not an obligatory NP constituent, nor is it precluded from
attaching to nouns that are the subjects of low-transitive verbs. To base a
claim about ergativity solely on this discourse marker, and ignore the verbal
cross-referencing   that is the primary      mechanism     for encoding     core
participant roles in Ngan'gityemerri, is unsatisfactory.
       - H&K's analysis of auxiliary-final nasals is particularly weak.
Although they correctly hear nasal gemination across the boundary between
the subject number marker and the auxiliary root (H&K p 40), their response
to the same phenomenon at the auxiliary-final boundary is to write a
morphophonemic rule that reduces underlying geminate nasals to single
nasals (H&K p 28).      In fact the maintenance of the single/geminate nasal
contrast in this position is crucial. The result of their rule would be to
neutralise the primary distinction between realis and irrealis auxiliary
categories. Additionally, H&K fail to hear the contrast between auxiliary-
final -m (present) and -ny (perfective) in Ngan'giwumirri, listing them
(H&K p 238-9) as simply variants. As a consequence of this they miss the
important      fact   that   Ngan'giwumirri      auxiliaries   have   four
tense/aspect/mood inflectional categories, with two of these (present and
perfective) being formally neutralised in Ngan'gikurunggurr.","[52, 53, 54]"
"9.2    Discourse Demonstratives           Yaga and Nyin(nin)
       The two demonstratives yaga and nyinnin have no function as spatial
or temporal deictics, but rather function as discourse deictics.   Their function
is to locate things with respect to their thematic status within a discourse,
not with respect to space or time. Yaga follows the first mention of referents
introduced to a discourse, establishing them as topic, usually where they
represent an unpredictable or surprising topic change.         Nyinnin is an
anaphoric demonstrative referring back to any person/thing/notion that the
speaker can assume the addressee will understand. This assumption can
generally be based on the shared understanding that the intended referent is
either currently topical, or is sufficiently well established within the
discourse that its restatement would be superfluous. Nyinnin is frequently
contracted to nyin, with no obvious semantic change. A few examples
within my texts suggest that the full form may possibly convey more definite
reference.
       The function and reference of both yaga and nyin(nin) can only really
be understood within the context of a sizable discourse sample.            Single
sentence examples containing these demonstratives are therefore fairly
meaningless. For this reason, although I have included a single example of
each here, readers are encouraged to look at the contextually established
occurrences of yaga and nyinnin in the texts in Appendix C.
          9-14 below comes from a text in which Robert Daly is telling me of
events concerning various people, all of whom are unknown to me.                  Taking
into account the difficulties he expects me to have in tracking reference
correctly, he works nyin(nin) overtime to make explicit who is doing what
to who. Note that here the context is sufficiently complicated that the
anaphoric marker alone does not suffice to disambiguate the actors. Robert
has to tag each anaphor to an explicit name or descriptive nominal.         9-14   minmimeny -ne, kanbi yaga minbe-merrendi gantyawam

"       As applicative -mi- and incorporated bodyparts cannot co-occur as
prefixes to the verb root, it is not always apparent which role -mi- is playing
in a given verb. That is, there are verbs employing -mi- in which not only is
an association with ‘eye’ quite plausible in semantic terms, but in which
-mi- could also be analysed as an applicative prefix augmenting the valence
of the verb root. Consider 3-143 and 3-144.      3-143 a)     _—ngirim -bubu

                   SU Perf
                   I hooked it up.
      In 3-143 b) -mi- could conceivably be an incorporated object bodypart,
as an association with ‘eye’, in a verb meaning ‘to put someone to sleep’,
would be quite plausible. However by comparison with the intransitive
verb in 3-143 a) it is apparent that -mi- in 3-143 b) has been applied to the
verb root -bubu to augment its associated monovalent argument structure,
to make its compositional valency compatible with its lexical transitivity.
       In 3-144 a) -mi- could conceivably be an applicative prefix augmenting
the valency of the verb root -wat. We could determine this with certainty if,
as in 3-143 above, we could contrast it with an intransitive verb employing
the same verb root. No such verb in fact exists, however we can show that
in this case -mi- is functioning as an incorporated bodypart patterning with
-syi- ‘nose’ in 3-144 b). The verb in 3-144    means ‘to hang up an object by
passing some sort of hook through it'. The incorporation of -mi- in 3-144 a)
focusses on the ‘eye-like hole’ through which the hook is inserted. The
incorporation of    -syi- in 3-144 b), on the other hand, focusses on the ‘nose-
like hook’ that is inserted through the hole.
        For non-native speakers this method of comparison can be employed
to disambiguate the particular function of -mi- in potentially ambiguous
instances. Needless to say, for native speakers who acquire an implicit feel
for the associated argument structure of verb roots, such a test is needless.
We should also consider the possibility that in verbs like 3-143 a) above,
where an eye association is compatible with the verbal semantics, that -mi-
encodes both grammatical and lexical meaning.            Green (1989) notes in
Marrithiyel that applicative prefixes clearly retain their bodypart semantics.","[173, 174]"
"Naturally these particles can only occur with verbs expressing
activities/states that are amenable of extended-in-time interpretations. As
discussed in 4.4.2, such interpretations may be available through the
durative lexical: aspectual nature of the verb itself, as in 8-41 and 8-42. For an
aspectually neutral verb like ‘go’ in 8-43 iterative aspect, as aliowed for in the
habitual reading of the 'present' auxiliary inflection, allows for an extended-
in-time interpretation. For an inherently punctual verb like ‘cough’, in 8-44
below, iterative aspect, as marked morphologically by reduplication of the
verb root, allows for an extended-in-time interpretation.        8-44   ngagadi -kikilik-tye       fal /tyip    /fexrp

        Throughout this grammar I treat the two dialects, Ngan'giwumirri

to treat them equally, I have chosen to focus on NgW and refer specifically
to NgK only where it differs from NgW in any significant way.",[48]
"‘Past Imperfective'
       The ‘Past Imperfective’ auxiliary inflection combines with the ‘Past’
tense enclitic -tye, to form a category that also has both temporal and
aspectual concerns. The Past Imperfective establishes activity as temporally
prior to the moment of speech, that is, not only the inception of the activity,
but also the completion of the activity, is located as temporally prior to the
reporting of that activity. So an activity or event marked in this way can no
longer hold true at the moment of speech. The Past Imperfective category is
also aspectually progressive or imperfective, in the sense that the activity is
presenied as having been, at that time, in progress and non-completed.         3-179 gagu      _ongini-lalirr-tye

utterance has been accompanied by hand-pointing in the appropriate direction. There are no
terms used for north or south, and the two terms for east and west are so under-exploited that
it seems to me that they exist above and beyond the traditional Ngan'gityemerri directional
system which is simply not of the compass directional type. Mirri menggetet and mirri
yenimdum may be traditionally employed terms, or they may be calques on either
neighbouring languages or indeed English. Either way, in contemporary Ngan'gityemerri

"             Regardless of whether a transitive verb belongs to the punctual or
      neutral class, in the absence of any overt morphology specifying its internal
      temporal constituency, its unmarked form is conceptually perfective in the
      sense that it is perceived of as a single event. Examples 3-226 and 3-227
      above,  for instance, though the first is neutral and the second punctual, are
      expressed as single events with no information given regarding their
      aspectual make-up. To this extent, 'perfectivity' can be said to be the
      unmarked aspectual category in Ngan'gityemerri.
            Imperfective/progressive aspect is encoded in transitive verbs by the
      serialisation     of   the    intransitive    posture   /   motion   auxiliaries.
      Morphologically, these serialised auxiliaries function as enclitics to the
      complex verb stem. Phonologically, as their morphological status might
suggest, these enclitics are assigned no primary stress, and fall within the
pitch contour assigned to the verbal complex as a single phonological word.
       Serialised auxiliaries must fill the final slot of the verb following the
tense markers. In this respect Ngan'gityemerri contrasts with Marrithiyel, a
neighbouring language that also marks imperfective aspect on transitive
verbs through the strategy of serialised posture/motion auxiliaries. In
Marrithiyel the major tense/mood suffixes shift rightwards from the
transitive verb to appear on the post-posed intransitive auxiliary (Green
1989:175). The ordering of these serialised auxiliaries as the final element of
the verbal complex in Ngan'gityemerri, further stands as a counter-example
to two of the general claims made by Foley and Van Valin about the
relationship between aspectual operators and the verb nuclei over which
they have scope.       Foley and Van Valin (1984::210) claim that aspect is a
nuclear operator while tense is a peripheral one. They argue that this
difference in scope is reflected in ordering constraints in those languages
that mark tense and aspect as separate inflectional categories. Quoting
examples from Kewa (Franklin 1971) and Tiwi (Osbourne 1974) they note
that aspect is always marked closer to the verb nuclei than tense, and add
that 'they know of no cases of the inverse ordering in which tense is closer
to the stem than aspect'(Foley and Van Valin 1984:210). In contradistinction
to this claim Ngan'gityemerri clearly marks tense closer to the verb nucleus
than imperfective aspect. This is demonstrated in 3-228 below, where the
Past tense enclitic -tye immediately follows the verb root, and is in turn
followed by the serialised 'Sit' auxiliary.       3-228 wanni_      -batybity-tye -winni      warrgudu

"  3.5.2      Syntactic versus Lexical Incorporation
       In characterising the grammatical relations holding between a verb
and the bodypart terms that can be incorporated into it, Evans (to appear)
has shown how a distinction between syntactic and lexical incorporation is
beneficial in the analysis of bodypart incorporation in Mayali, a
Kunwinjkuan       language of south-west Arnhem            Land. Syntactic
incorporation is optional, fully productive and       constrained to certain
predictable grammatical relations between the incorporated nominal and
predicate. Lexically incorporated nominals, on the other hand, may bear a
wider variety of grammatical relations to the incorporating verb and are not
fully productive. Their meaning, which may be compositional or non-
compositional, cannot generally be paraphrased by omitting the
incorporated nominal, or by having it appear as an external nominal (loc.
cit.).
       This kind of analysis can usefully be applied to Ngan'gityemerri,
where syntactic incorporation also operates under fairly rigid constraints on
the nature of the grammatical relations that hold between a bodypart and a
predicate. Lexical incorporation, on the other hand, allows a wide variety of
grammatical relations to hold between a bodypart and a predicate, although
the nature of these relations is typically vague or variable, as lexically
incorporated bodyparts tend to lose the semantic characteristics associated
with their freeform occurrence, and function to narrow the scope of the verb
rather than retaining their identity as verbal arguments        . For certain
bodyparts we show how their effect on the scope of a verb shows signs of
developing into a quasi-classificatory system whereby they are incorporated
in a general sense to qualify verbs that are directed at particular iypes of
entities. Both these types of incorporation are treated in the following
sections.
        Only a single slot is available within the verbal structure for
incorporated bodyparts, both syntactic and lexical incorporations competing
for this position.   As a consequence of this, the syntactic incorporation of
verbal arguments is blocked where the verbroot is a lexicalised bodypart -
verb root compound.
      Syntactically incorporated bodyparts are always optional, they can be
omitted from the verb and instead be paraphrased by an external nominal.
Bodyparts can be syntactically incorporated into any semantically compatible
verb, whereas lexically incorporated bodyparts cannot be predicted, and
require specification within the lexicon.
        The main types of grammatical relations that are permissive of the
syntactic incorporation of bodypart terms are where their possessors are the
objects and locatives of transitive verbs, or the subjects of verbs formed with
the 'detransitivised' and 'Say' auxiliaries. Each of these are discussed below.
      In transitive verbs the incorporated      bodypart can denote the specific
whele object.      3-273        ngarim -fi -yedirr-tyat

"8.3.4  Space, Time and Number Emphasis
       A favoured construction in Ngan’gityemerri for giving emphasis to
expressions of space, time and number, is to negate their opposites.
Examples of negated spatial and temporal qualifiers have already been given
in 8-11 and 8-56 and 8-57. Although numeric emphasis can be given using
the quantifiers mebuk/mabuk (K)'many' and bakuty ‘many’, again the
favoured construction is to negate an expressed singular quantity. This is
demonstrated in 8-72 and 8-73.        8-72   minbe wunggume          wanni-pagu -tye

75     Ninggi            DESPITE
       The enclitic -ninggi is discussed in 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 as a case inflection to
NP's in agentive and instrumental roles.              The homophonous form
examined in this section is a freeform particle which occurs in clause-initial
position and is quite unrelated to the case enclitic.
       Ninggi designates the clause over which it has scope, as a proposition
from which one could make logical assumptions, assumptions that are then
contradicted in the following clause. This could usefully be explicated as:
‘Even though proposition X would lead you to assume proposition Y, in
fact, illogically, proposition Z is the case’. Proposition Y, as a logical
assumption, would not normally be given. Ninggi typically prefaces
proposition X, as in the examples below.       7-12     ninggi    tyawurru   dam        -fi -sul,    ep    nginimem bulbulfi

"1.1     Language Names!
        The   names      Ngan'gikurunggurr       and    Ngan’giwumirri       are
etymologically compounds of ngan'gi ‘language/story/word' and
kurunggurr and wumirri. Kurunggurr is both the name of a particular
billabong in the muyil marshland west of Peppimenarti, and also the
general term, in both Ngan'gikurunggurr and Ngan'giwumirri, for deep,
dark water, as found midstream in a river. Ngan'gikurunggurr people do
not prefer either one of these referents, as opposed to the other, as the source
of the language name. The etymology of wumirri is not clear. In response
to my queries, some Ngan'giwumirri people have remarked upon the
similarity with wumirr ‘the resinous substance found among the roots of
the ironbark tree’. There is however no general agreement about the
relevance of this similar term to the language name, nor any supporting
morphological evidence (i.e. the final -i is otherwise unattested as any sort
of derivational suffix).
        Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr are, on linguistic criteria,
dialects of a single language. They share an identical phonemic inventory
(though realisation and stress rules differ); share identical verbal structure -
the number and semantics of their systems of auxiliary verb appear to map
onto each other perfectly; they share a cognacy rate of about 85%; and are
mutually intelligible. Speakers of these dialects refer to them as ‘languages’,
and acknowledge their subgrouping by comparing their degree of similarity
with other pairs of dialects - ""NgK and NgW go level, like Marrithiyel and
Marrisjebin go level"".       Speakers of both dialects agree that NgK is
‘light/smooth' while NgW is ‘heavy/rough’.               To judge from their1In referring to the names of other languages I use those that stem from what I consider to be

Marringarr, Marri Dan, Marri Ammu, Marri Ge:, Marramaninjsji, Merranunggu, and
Menhdha. I have also adopted Green's spelling for Matngela (though without the superscript
y following the ng, denoting a palatal off-glide). Gamu is written in the orthography of
Harvey (pers. comm.), (who incidently believes the final vowel of Matngela to be i, e.g.
Matngeli). Murrinh-patha is written in the orthography used by the Port Keats school.
Jaminjung follows Chadwick (1984 ms), and Wagiman follows Cook (1987). Emmi follows
Ford (pers. comm.). At certain places in the text I give the variant spellings of other authors.
In these cases I have adopted the practise of enclosing such language names within single
quotation marks, e.g. ‘Nengomeri'.
comments, this distinction would appear to be based primarily on the strict
maintenance in NgW of hetero-organic nasal/nasal and nasal/stop clusters
at the boundary between the auxiliary root and whatever follows it. The
same underlying clusters in NgK are subject to assimilation rules, e.g.","[27, 28]"

singers do this by singing ‘ny ny ny’.
        In addition to songstyle affiliations claimed through one's patriline,
all males who have been through the circumcision stage of initiation have
an affilation with the songstyle that was performed at the moment that they
were cut. This affiliation is expressed in such terms as; ""I was cut lirrga-
way, so even though I'm a wangga man (by patrilineal affiliation), if I was .
visiting on the Wagiman side (who are lirrga by patrilineal affiliation) then
they'd know me over there"". This kind of affiliation is also expressed in the
use of songstyle terms as names for men. Any man can be indirectly referred
to, or directly addressed, by the songstyle associated in this manner with his
circumcision (see the reference to Warrigal Martin as ‘lirrga' throughout
most of Text 1 in Appendix C. Being Marrisjebin, Warrigal inherits and
performs the wangga songstyle, but was cut lirrga-way). Calling to someone
in this way serves to remind them of the bond forged between the initiate191 am grateful to Long Harry for his permission to reproduce this song here. This is the same
song that he sang   for the court during the Upper Daly claim hearings, as evidence of his
affiliations to the rak-Lafuganying estate.

"5.3.1    Generics   + Simple NP modifiers
         Firstly, as evident in the examples of modified nouns in the preceding
sections of this chapter, modifiers can be adjectives, pronouns, anaphoric
demonstratives, deictics and numerals. These modifier types in head -
modifier constructions are demonstrated in 5-105.         5-105 wur-yubu                         a good woman

         Additionally, NPs can be headed by bound generics.            As is evident in
examples 5-108 and 5-110, the bound generic can head a noun that itself
carries a class prefix. As the modifying element is becoming increasingly
complex, at this point I will adopt the convention of indicating the scope of
the leftmost generic by placing the modifying element over which it
operates, in square brackets.         5-106 wa-[Darwin-nimbi]                5-107 wur-[wusye dadirrmade]

       Bound generics can also head a clause. The resultant nominalised

common feature of reduplicated nominals                               in non-Pama        Nyungan
languages (Ann Dineen: pers. comm.)
       In contrast the morphology of verb root reduplication                              is quite
complex. Monosyllabic verb roots reduplicate in full, as in 3-153.       3-153            a)                                  -pupu                 ask
                        b)                                  -wewe                 vomit
                        °)                                                        strikeWe know that this reduplication is to the right, (ie. the reduplicated form
follows the stem), because the reduplicated syllable generally undergoes
vowel change. The target vowel for the reduplicated syllable is the high
front vowel, and all four phonemic vowels can be seen to select /i/ in their
reduplicated forms. The three examples given in 3-153 are in this respect
exceptional. However consider the reduplicated monosyllabic verb roots in
3-154 below.       3-154                                                -tiptip               grab                                                            ~pefik                drip
                                                  —         -batybity             hold                        d)                        >         -wutyity              pourThis process is given as a 'tendency' rather than a firm rule because of the
examples       like   those   in 3-153         above,   and     also    because   where      some
monosyllables         with back vowels            /a/   and     /u/     are reduplicated, the
reduplicatea vowel is sometimes raised without neccessarily being fronted.
Thus, in addition to their stated target of /i/, as in 3-154 above,                 /a/ and /u/
have both been found to reduplicate as /u/, as in the examples below.       3-155            a)     -wa         >      -wawy                    -      pick up                        b)     -pap        —      -pappup                         climb                        c)     -bul        —      -bulbul                         burn       We can therefore summarise the reduplication of monosyllabic verb
roots by the following rule;
        .               CiVi(Cy)      =>          CiVi(C3)C1V2(Ca)
noting the general tendency for V2 to be [+ high] and usually also [+ front].
        As is evident from 3-154 b) and d) above, some of the C3 + C; clusters
that result from       the reduplication of verb roots, are subject to certain
morphophonological processes!!.
      Di-syllabic verb roots with an initial closed syllable are very rare, but
appear to reduplicate in full in the same way as nominals.         3-156         -filkity        —          -filkityfilkity                     spin round        However di-syllabic verb roots with initial open syllables reduplicate
the initial syllable only, i.e. they reduplicate partially and to the left.

12Both -palak and -kuduk have been recorded once in their reduplicated form by a single,
young speaker, as -palakpalak and -kudukkuduk. This is suggestive of reanalysis of the
somewhat complex reduplication rules for di-syllabic verb roots, to the simpler rule whereby
all roots, both nominal and verbal, reduplicate in full. I cannot comment here on whether this
phenemenon may reflect a stage in either language acquisition or language death.
          Verb root reduplication can therefore be summarised in the following
way.                                                      ,

"2.1.3.1    Prominence of Active Articulators
        In the descriptions of many Australian languages ‘place of
articulation’ is typically viewed as a significant criterion in the analysis of
consonant phonemes. This term puts implicit and, for Ngan'gityemerri,
inappropriate focus on the passive articulator. In both Ngan'gikurunggurr
and     Ngan'giwumirri,      which   make   no     contrastive   distinction   between
alveolar and retroflex, or (inter)dental and palatal, there is nothing to be
gained by making an analysis in terms of passive articulators. In preference
we have four types of ‘active articulation’, one involving both lips -
‘bilabial’, and three involving types of tongue configuration          -'apical',
‘laminal' and ‘dorsal’.
        This type of system that focusses on tongue configuration, allows for a
wide range of mouth-roof space within which the tongue can make its
contact (or approximation). The contact point of apical phonemes thus
ranges from alveolar to postalveolar, and that of laminal phonemes ranges
from interdental to palatal. It is only at the allophonic level that we need
invoke the criterion of ‘place of articulation’. Elsewhere throughout this
work reference to phoneme types is made only in terms of active
articulators.
2.1.3.2 Realisation of Obstruent Phonemes
/p/ -       The bilabial stop [p"") is always voiceless, aspirated and long
            with no variation in closure type./b/ -       The bilabial stop [b] is always voiced and unaspirated, and is
            consistently shorter than the voiceless stop. However it exploits
            durational difference to a far lesser degree than is found for
            other articulator types (see 2.2.2). /b/ shows less fluctuation in
            closure type than do the other voiced stops, being always fully
            stopped.            is a bilabial fricative [9], lightly spread and with a small degree
            of lip tension. Observation of speakers' lip movement shows
            this sound to be truly bilabial, in that the teeth are not visible
            and the upper and lower lips are aligned and make even
            contact. However this sound has some of the turbulent quality
            (auditory correlate of energy higher in the spectrum) that is
            normally associated with labiodental articulation. The
            presence of this turbulence suggests that the lip spread and
            tension pulls the top lip sufficiently tightly against the upper
            teeth that they act as joint articulators in opposing the bottom
            lip. Even if the upper teeth do not actually come into contact
            with the lower lip, they at least approach it closely enough to
            generate wake turbulence. Among the younger speakers of
            Ngan'gityemerri, (who have been exposed to a considerable
            amount of Standard English through their schooling and, more
            recently, through television), this fricative is usually realised as
            a true labiodental [f].
            As has been noted for all other Australian languages that have
            both a stop contrast and fricatives, the contrast does not extend
            to the fricatives (Dixon 1980:215). /f/ is always voiceless
            initially, and varies between voiced and voiceless when
            intervocalic or post-liquid. /f/ only occurs post-nasally across a
            morpheme boundary in which environment it remains
            voiceless.            2-18   funggulu(NgW)       - sugarbag          [dangolu]

               This tendency towards voicing assimilation (assuming [9] to be
               the unmarked allophone), is much stronger in
               Ngan'giwumirri than it is in Ngan’gikurunggurr. A text count
               of word medial /f/ indicates about 80% are voiced in
               Ngan'giwumirri, compared with only about 15% in
               Ngan'gikurunggurr. Although this variation in the degree of
               glottal pulsing through the approximation duration of medial
               /£/ is biased differently in each dialect, it is still ‘free’ variation
               in the sense that it is non-contrastive within the phonological
               system of each dialect’.
               Finally, a very minor allophone, a voiceless bilabial fricative
               with labiodorsal secondary articulation [$”], has been recorded
               as a free variant of word initial [] in a single word only.               2-19    fa(K)-                beeswax       [$a] ~ [$a]
3We can further observe a type of ‘fixed’ variation, whereby certain cognate lexemes are
invariably realised    with      voiceless    /f/      in Ngan'gikurunggurr,     and    voiced   /f/   in
Ngan'giwumirri.

markers; that is, the minor phonetic differences between them are strictly and invariably
maintained as evidence of the separate identities of the two groups, usually at other levels
(eg. political). In discussion of these words, speakers will carefully point out that “we say it
this way, but that other mob say it this way"". So despite the non-contrastive nature of the
feature tvoice among fricatives within the phonological systems of each of these languages,
the same feature is employed cross-dialectically, within a subset of the lexicon at least, to
flag linguistic identification. How, within the scope of the general lexicon, certain lexemes
come to be employed in this manner remains a question for further study. Note though that
these kinds of examples nicely illustrate Labov's observation that there is really no such
thing as free variation, if social and stylistic variables are considered to constitute part of
the conditioning environment.
               We can partially account for the occurrence of this minor
               allophone by noting that this word is already marked as
               phonotactically odd, being one of only a handful of
               monosyllables, and one of only two beginning with /f/.
               The labiodorsal variant is unlikely to be the reduced form of an
               underlying disyllabic lexeme /fuwa/, because such a word
               would be equally phonotactically odd, as the labial semivowel
               is otherwise unattested between these vowels. And there are
               no other examples of [$”a] to suggest that all such underlying
               segments may have undergone reduction of this sort.               is a long voiceless aspirated apical stop [t""] with no variation in
               closure type.               is a short voiced apical stop. Both /t/ and /d/, but particularly
               /d/, exploit a fairly wide range of mouth-roof contact points,
               from alveolar [d] to post-alveolar   [d]. The degree of retroflexion
               found in apical stops is sensitive to the environment.       I
               perceive initial and intervocalic /d/ to be more retroflex than
               post-nasal /d/, and /d/ after back vowels to be more retroflex
               than /d/ after front vowels.
               Intervocalic /d/ can be very short, especiallyin unstressed
               syllables, and ir this environment is frequently
               reduced to an alveolar aproximant [1]. This realisation of /d/
               can be consistently distinguished from the post-alveolar
               continuant /r/ (also given below as [1] 4) by its shorter duration
               and lack of retroflexion.              is a voiced retroflex fricative. This sound is described by Capell
              as a ""retroflex rhotic with fricated release""(quoted in H&K
              1988:16), and by Hoddinott and Kofod as a ""retroflex fricative
              with rhotic release""(Hé&K 1988:16). Neither of these
              descriptions are particularly accurate in articulatory terms, if for
              no other reason than that neither fricatives nor rhotics have
              ‘release’. I do agree with both authors though, that auditorily
              there is a definite r-colouring to the realisation of this
              phoneme. This in itself presents a descriptive problem as the
4Note   that IPA (1989 update) provides no satisfactory mechanism   for differentiating
between alveolar and post-alveolar approximants.

developed diachronically from a cluster of flaps, ie /rr/ + /rr/.
Its restricted word position potential and low functional load
are additionally suggestive of fairly recent development.
However within the contemporary phonemic system we need
to accord /s/ phonemic status to account for its contrastive use

postnasally. For those articulator types having a contrast
between two series of stops, the post-nasal environment is
‘neutralised’. For the laminals however, in the absence of a
contrastive voiced laminal phoneme, we would specify [ J] as a
post-nasally conditioned allophone of /ty/.

              and then there was pygmy geese, bandicoots, goannas, eagles,Two devices are employed here to keep track of the fact that this is a list of
connected names. Firstly, note that the ‘animal’ generic gagu is included
with every second or third listed noun. Secondly, ninde ‘and then’ prefaces
that part of the list that constitutes a second breathgroup, i.e. when the
speaker had to stop and take a breath because the list was so long, he began
again with ninde.        Ninde         thus indicates that what follows is to be
understood as a continuation of what preceded. Given the comparative
rarity of such lengthy strings of conjoined elements, there are few tokens of
ninde in my data.
       E can be used to conjoin either NP's or clauses, as in 7-29 and 7-30,
though like ninde, few examples are found in either text or conversation.
The rare use and typically slow delivery of e suggests that it is in fact as
much a hesitation device as a connector.       7-29   teacher wurruke          Glene           Tony

Some of these forms are listed below, with yani-, the 2nd person singular

The six verb roots listed in 3-158 all form dynamic action verbs with the 'Go'
auxiliary, and this appears to be the common feature that permits deletion
of the auxiliary verb.
        The major difference between fully finite imperatives, and isolated
imperative verb roots, is that the latter have greater illocutionary force.
Being typically either mono-syllabic, or di-syllabic, the brevity of verb roots
is conducive to their imperative use with strong articulatory force. Within
normal discourse constraints they are generally used only to children and
dogs.     Syntactically, of course, isolated verb roots differ from finite
imperatives in their inability to be explicitly associated with a nominal
argument through the normal means of pronominal cross-referencing.
However given the role cf imperatives within discourse, subject reference is
typically very clear.
        Where isolated verb roots, functioning as imperatives, follow full
finite verbs within a single breath group, as in 3-160 below;      3-160 wembem           ngayi-nide   ya      “fi   -tyuk     pirr

              Put it down in my house and leave it !they appear to constitute examples of multiple verb roots being governed by
a single auxiliary. Again, I analyse such examples as two independent verbs,
with auriliary deletion in the latter VP.         The tendency for the latter verb
root to bear stress marking, and be set off by a pause, supports such an
analysis   Example 3-160 above, is therefore treated as a contraction of 3-161

"        The nominalisation of clauses by heading them with class generics in
this way, is the main strategy for deriving formal relative NPs in
Ngan'gityemerri. As noted above, nominalised clauses are fully finite,
having the form of independent clauses. It appears that in those Australian
languages having a general subordinate clause type, such clauses are
typically finite and have a fairly loose paratactic relation to the main clause
(see for instance Merlan (1983:135)). In Ngan'gityemerri however relative
clauses, though finite, are formally nominalised by the attachment of noun
class prefixes. I am unaware of any other Australian language for which this
use of noun      class markers       has been reported.     Given    their status as
nominals, generic-headed clauses need not be considered subordinate to a
main verb, but simply as modifiers of arguments of the main verb. Thus in
5-112 above, musyulng ‘swag’ is the O of the verb ‘roll up', and the two
generic-headed NP's yerr-nem ‘the thing of his' and yerr-dede peyi-nimbi
use 'im-ngirrminygu ‘the thing we'd used from his house’, are both
nominals modifying that O NP. Likewise the nominalised clause in 5-113
below modifies the A NP (encliticised with agentive -ninggi). Where the
specific noun is omitted, as in 5-114 to 5-116, the nominalised clause stands
as a head - modifier type NP and fills the argument role of the predicate
rather than modifying an NP in that role. This directly parallels the analysis
given for non-verbal modifying elements in 5.2 above (see eg 5-104 wur-
yubu) where a class prefixed simple nominal modifier can either modify a
given noun or, in the absence of a given head noun, constitute a head -
modifier NP. There are no constraints on the argument roles that
nominalised clauses can either modify, or in themselves constitute. In 5-112
above and 5-113 below the nominalised clauses modify the O and A of the
verb, in 5-115 the nominalised clause is an ASSOCiative argument of the
verb, and in 5-116 and 5-117, the nominalised clauses are verbal arguments
in the local case roles SOURCE and LOCative, respectively.      5-113 ticket kinyi nginimem pay ‘im-meny watypela -ninggi

             from (the shop) that is Peppimenarti's shop'.
             (the Darwin shop that supplies the Peppimenarti store)      Section 6.1 examines the way in which NPs can be, though are not
obligatorily, marked for certain case functions with a set of enclitics (see for
instance, ‘agentive' -ninggi in 5-113 above). Note though that nominalised
clauses functioning as verbal arguments, as in 5-114 to 5-116, cannot have
their local or syntactic case roles marked with these enclitics. In the same
way that case enclitics are freely omitted from even simple NPs, this is
unlikely to result in ambiguous relations with the verb, as the role of the
nominalised clause will generally be evident from the thematic content and
the meaning of the predicate. Where the role of a nominalised clause
requires overt specification, this can be achieved by attaching the case
enclitic to the anaphoric demonstrative, as demonstrated in 5-116.
        Consistent with the unconstrained roles that nominalised clauses can
fill as arguments of the verb, there are likewise no constraints on the types
of relations that can hold between the head generic and the verb of the
nominalised clause. Thus in 5-113 and 5-116 the head of the nominalised
clause is the S of the intransitive nominalised verb, in 5-112 it is the O, and
in 5-115 where the generic nominalises a merrendi subordinate clause (cf.
6.2.3), the head is not an argument of the nominalised verb at all.
       Finally, having established that head - modifier constructions consist
of a noun class generic as proclitic to a wide range of modifier types, ranging
from simple nominals such as adjectives, through to fully finite clauses and,
as 5-117 below demonstrates, strings of finite clauses, we should             ask
ourselves ‘how do we determine the scope of the head generic ?'.      5-117 yentyi   -ngirrki-tye yerr-[watypela nem, wannim-derri-tyerr,
