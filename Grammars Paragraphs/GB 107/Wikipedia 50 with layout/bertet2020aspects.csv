"7.3       Non-clausal negation (negative existential
          indefinites)
    If a clause in the positive polarity contains existential300 indefinites (compa-
rable to English ‘something, somewhere, etc.’) that precede the main predica-
tive phrase, then the standard negator tãů ‘neg’ (on standard negation, see Sec-
tion 7.2.1 above) is not normally used to negate it. That clause’s existential indef-
inites are replaced by corresponding negative existential indefinites instead (com-
parable to English ‘nothing, nowhere, etc.’).301    One part of these negative existential indefinites is productively derived as sub-
ject participant relativizations including the negative existential verb root
tåʼu ‘be absent’ (on tåʼu ‘be absent’, see Section 7.2.2 above). Due to their nature
of relativizations, these inflect for nominal class. Their basic forms are listed in
  299
      The form timbu stands for local Sp. timbo ‘plastic barrel’. The Spanish word’s phonological form
is slightly adapted when inserted in a smat utterance by code-mixing (see Section 2.7.2.2).
  300
     Indefinites with semantic values other than existential (e.g. specific or universal indefinites)
do not have negative counterparts and do not display the behavior described in this section under
the scope of negation. See example (602) above for a case of negative clause featuring a (positive)
indefinite with a universal meaning (‘just any …’).
  301
     I do not have enough data to explore what happens in cases where within a single clause
there might be a conflict on whether an existential indefinite or the main verb should be the locus
for negative polarity, i.e. cases where an existential indefinite is involved in existential, topical-
locational, or privative negation (on these contexts of negation, see Sections 7.2.2–7.2.3), with
meanings such as ‘Wheat never existed in this region.’ or ‘I don’t have anything.’.",[531]

        because I have a knee injury.’ [igv 626]   Tåʼúgù (∼tågù), rather than meaning ‘never’, occasionally appears to merely
function as a more emphatic alternative for the standard negator tãu       ̊ ‘neg’
(on which see Section 7.2.1), as in the following example:(630)   Tåʼúgù chā-chíbǜ i ̀ chòmà.
        tåʼú-gù                  chā=chíbǜ i ̀=chò-mà
        be.absent\sbjv?-ploc 1sg.sbj=eat lk.ns=1sg-anaph        ‘[He made me drink and now I’m a bit drunk.] I had not eaten.’ [ano1 181]    If several existential indefinites co-occur within a single clause, then only the
first one is negative, while the next ones remain as they would be in the correspond-
ing positive clause. This is illustrated in the following example:(631)   Tåʼúgù mā g̃èʼta̋ nà-ũʼ̂ ü̃́ […].
        tåʼú-gù=mā                          g̃èʼta̋

within a given clause, and more specifically on the first available locus. This
rule equally applies across different types of negation strategies in cases where
they could in principle co-occur, e.g. when topical-locational negation (on topical-
locational negation, see Section 7.2.2) and an existential indefinite post-posed to
it co-occur within the same clause, as in the following example:(632)   […] nà-tåʼúʼü̃́ gá åkǘ […].        nà=tåʼú-ʼü̃́                                   gá=åkǘ

7. Negation
        ‘[…] there wasn’t anything [in the animal’s mouth] […].’ [lar C438]   Two negative words do occasionally co-occur within a single clause, but with
the consequence that their negative values cancel each other, as in the following
example:(633)   […] mārǖ tåʼúʼü̃́ cha̋-tåʼṵgú ì chàuchíʼüwa̋
                                                 ̃̀  […].        mārǖ tåʼú-ʼü̃́                   cha̋=tåʼṵ-gú

        575]7.4      Negation and phase aspect
   Negative polarity, whether clausal or non-clausal, never has scope over the sec-
ond position clitic /=tàa/̃̄ ‘itself’ and the independent particle mārǖ ‘prf’ (or its
proclitic variant /mā=/). Thus:   – /=tàa/̃̄ co-occurring with negative polarity within a clause yields the mean-
     ing ‘(not) yet’ (lit. ‘It is still the case that [clause.in.the.negative.polari-
     ty]’), as shown in examples (634–636);   – mārǖ (or /mā=/) co-occurring with negative polarity within a clause
     yields the meaning ‘(no) longer’ (lit. ‘It has now become the case that
     [clause.in.the.negative.polarity]’), as shown in (637–638).305(634)   Tãů tàã ̄ chānā-üğ ǘ.

moꜜo ‘prf’, or Central Thai ยัง jāŋ ‘still’ and แลว lɛ́ːw ‘prf’.","[535, 536, 537]"
"7.2.3         Privative negation
    Another context in which the mere adjunction of tãů ‘neg’ is not normally avail-
able as a strategy to convert a positive clause into its corresponding negative clause
is when possessive predication is involved (on positive possessive predication, see
Sections 4.2.5.3 and 4.3.3.6). In other words, a clause that predicates possession
by means of the possessive predicative suffix /-ã/̰ and/or the possessive verb ã̄ ‘to
have’ in its positive polarity (e.g. /chā=âirű-ã/̰ ‘I have a dog’ or /chā=ã-̄ pátā/
‘I have a house’) can normally not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? /tãu      ̊
                                               ̊ chā=ã-̄ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a house’).

A dedicated privative (i.e. negative possessive) verb root /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’524

is regularly used instead and no other marker of negation appears in the clause
(e.g. /chā=g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ âirű-ã/̰ ‘I don’t have a dog’ or /chā=g̃e-̊ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a
house’).298    As is regularly the case when incorporation of a nominal constituent into the
predicative phrase occurs (on incorporation, see Section 4.2.5), if the referent
whose being possessed is negated is referred to with a bound noun, then the priva-
tive predicative word takes on the form /g̃e-̊ /bound.noun (not.have-bound.noun),
as in examples (617–618). By contrast, if that referent is referred to with a full NP
(and with an independent noun in particular), then the privative predicative phrase
takes on the structure /g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ NP-ã/̰ (not.have-gen NP-poss), as in (619).","[529, 530]"

7.1     Overview
    This chapter deals with the morphemes and constructions that are resorted
to for setting a clause’s polarity to negative. The major functions related to
negative polarity and the morphosyntactic strategies applied to execute them are
briefly summarized in Table 49. These aspects, and a few more, are discussed in
detail in the next sections (the corresponding sections are referred to by numbers
in parentheses in Table 49). For a typological discussion of most of the functions
identified in Table 49, see van der Auwera & Krasnoukhova (2020). The struc-
ture of this entire chapter is inspired by Miestamo (2017) and van der Auwera &                                         517

clause without affecting in any way its morphosyntactic structure, can be used in a
large variety of contexts. In particular, tãů ‘neg’ occurs:   – with most types of predicative phrases, whether verbal (as in examples (601–
     604) and (608–609)) or non-verbal (as in (605–607));   – in both main clauses (as in (601), (603–606), and (609)) and subordinate
     clauses (as in (607–608));   – with both the Indicative Inflectional Type (as in (602) and (604–606)) and
     the Subjunctive (and Subjunctive + /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’) Inflectional Type (as in (601),
     (603), and (607–610));   – and in declarative utterances (as in (601) and (603–606)), interrogative ut-
     terances (as in (609)), and exclamative utterances (as in (606)).","[518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525]"
"
    In the following elicited example, however, a positive existential indefinite (g̃eʼ̀ ta̋
  310‘where?.aloc’) co-occurs with tãů ‘neg’ within a single negative clause:   (i) Tãů tā g̃eʼ̀ ta̋ kù-ũʼ̂ ü!̃́

       ‘Don’t move from there [lit. ‘Don’t go anywhere!’]!’ [ear elic.]     It might thus be that negative polarity in prohibitive utterances always has to be marked by
tãů ‘neg’, regardless of whether existential indefinites are present in the clause or not—while in
declarative and interrogative utterances (see Section 7.5 above), these existential indefinites, if
present, would have been the regular locus for the encoding of negative polarity. However, it
might also be that the example cited above is a rarer and somewhat artificial alternative to an
expected (but unattested) ? Tåʼúwa̋ tā kù-ũʼ̂ ü!̃́ [lit. ‘Go nowhere!’], where negative polarity would be
encoded within the negative existential indefinite (tåʼúwa̋ ‘nowhere’) itself. The details of the smat
prohibitive construction will require more exploration.",[544]

negative indefinites (see Section 7.3 above) in its position for focalized negative
words (with meanings such as ‘Don’t touch anything!’ or ‘Never tell them about
it!’).3107.8       Negation and coordination
    Negative polarity and coordination do not display any specific interaction.
Negation and coordination in the expression of groups such as ‘X and not Y’, ‘not
X and Y’, or ‘not X and not/nor Y’ (with X and Y being either arguments or whole
clauses) are thus encoded separately by their ordinary dedicated markers. The
following example illustrates the coordination of two negative clauses (of the type
‘not X and not/nor Y’), which is ordinarily done by means of the general coordina-
tion marker rǜ ‘and’:(651)     Ṵ̈ kü̋ tãů pūrākǘ i ̀ yâʼü̃́ níì-ĩ ̊ rǜ <tãů …> tãů nágù tá chàgǜ chīì-ma̰ʼüc̋ hì.","[543, 544]"
"7.6       Pro-sentential negation
    There is no morpheme specialized in pro-sentential negation in smat. Negative
pro-sentences result from the mere ellipsis of any other constituent than the
negative word from what their equivalent full negative clause would be (although
that negative word’s clitics and/or mārǖ ‘prf’ often remain, if present, as in the
first half of example (644)). Thus, (644) can be interpreted as being based on a full
                   ̊ ʼǘ̃=mā=nü̂wa̋/ [/maloca-wa̋ tā=måʼ-ē-gǘ gá nůʼkǘmá./] ‘[We]
clause such as /Tãu
didn’t [live in a maloca in the old days.].’, and (645) can be interpreted as being
based on a full clause such as Tãů ʼü̃́ [/chā=/ti ́mido.] ‘[I’m] not [tímido.]’. Example
(646) starts with the realization of a full clause, and then proceeds to “repeating”
that same clause by means of tågù ‘never’ used as a pro-sentential negation marker.",[541]
"7.2.2        Existential and topical-locational negation
      One of the few contexts in which the mere adjunction of tãů ‘neg’ is not normally
available as a strategy to convert a positive clause into its corresponding negative
clause is when existential predication is involved (on existential predication, see
Section 3.4.4). In other words, a clause that includes an existential predicative
word in its positive polarity (e.g. Ná-ngēmà i ̀ chi ̆ʼnü.́ ‘There is pineapples.’) can nor-
mally not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? Tãů ná-ngēmà i ̀ chi ̆ʼnü.́ ‘There is no
pineapples.’). A dedicated negative existential verb tåʼu ‘be absent’ is regularly
used instead and no other marker of negation appears in the clause (e.g. Ná-tåʼu
i ̀ chi ̆ʼnü.́ ‘There is no pineapples.’). This is illustrated in the following examples

        91]    Existential negation is occasionally used to express privative negation; tåʼu
could then be glossed as ‘to lack’ (but see Section 7.2.3 below on a more com-
mon way to express privative negation). The referent whose being possessed is
negated then appears as a subject argument, and the one whose being a possessor
is negated is encoded as an oblique argument in the benefactive(-malefactive) case
(as in example (612)) or the genitive case (as in (613)) although the latter may also
be omitted altogether and left to be understood from the context (as in (614)):(612)   […] ngēmà <tãů nűà t…> tő-tåʼúʼü̃́ […].        ngē-mà              <tãů nű-à                      t…> tő=tåʼú-ʼü̃́

7. Negation
noun /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ (e.g. Ná-ngĕʼmá i ̀ yői ̀. ‘There’s boas [there].’) can normally
not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? Tãů ná-ngĕʼmá i ̀ yői ̀. ‘There isn’t boas
[there].’). Tåʼu ‘be absent’ is used instead (e.g. Ná-tåʼu i ̀ yői ̀. ‘There isn’t boas
[there].’). The topical location may be explicitly mentioned in the clause express-
ing negative topical-location (as in example (615)) or not be explicitly mentioned
(as in (616)). Note that by contrast to topical-locational predication, non-topical
locational predication is regularly negated with tãů ‘neg’, as in (606) above.","[527, 528, 529]"
"    In answers to interro-negative questions (e.g. ‘Don’t you like it?’), pro-senten-
tial negation is pragmatically used for confirmation by the speaker of the as-
sumption of the addressee (‘No, [I don’t like it indeed.]’), as shown in the follow-
ing example:(648)    [Tãů tàã̄ k[i ̄]-pà?]—Tãů ʼü!̃́         tãů =tàã̄   k[i ̄]=pà                           ̊ ʼü̃́

    Negation cannot co-occur with a predicative phrase in the Imperative Inflec-
tional Type (on which see Section 5.4). The negative imperative construction used
to express prohibitives, whether with a singular or a plural second person subject,
seems to be based on the negation focus construction described in Section 7.5
above (focalized.negative.word (inflected.copula) (lk=)clause.in.sbjv-
sub). By contrast to the negation focus construction, however, the prohibitive con-
struction does not seem to ever involve the use of the inflected copula, and it often—
although not obligatorily—includes an additional specialized prohibitive second
position enclitic /=tā/ ‘proh’ (focalized.negative.word=proh (lk=)
clause.in.sbjv-sub).309 My corpus and elicitation notes only contain cases of pro-
hibitives involving the negative word tãů ‘neg’, such as the following:(649)    Tãů (tā) (i ̀) “nôʼe̋” ña̋kùʼü̃́ tüʼ̂ ü!̃̄
            ̊ (=tā)
         tãu              (i ̀=)nôʼe̋                ña̋-kù-ʼü̃́    tü-̂ ʼü̃̄
         neg=proh lk.ns=old.woman do.thus-2sg.sbj\sbjv-sub 3s-acc         ‘Don’t call her “grandma”!’ [ear elic.]
(650)    Tãů tā ì pē-chókùgüʼ̋ ü!̃́ 309
     According to ear, using the (optional) linker in the prohibitive construction imparts extra
directive strength to the prohibition and may make it sound more threatening.",[543]
"    A rarer but stronger construction used for reinforcing negation can be syntacti-
cally interpreted as negation focus (‘It is not the case that …’). In this construction,
the non predicative negative word in a clause (i.e. tãů ‘neg’ or a negative existen-
tial indefinite) appears in the regular position of focalized constituents (focalized.
constituent inflected.copula (lk=)clause.in.sbjv-sub; on focalization, see
Section 5.2.6, p.426). From a pragmatic perspective, this construction is often
used when contradiction of a previous statement, an assumption, or a wish is
implied (‘[Contrary to what I/you/they said/believed/want,] negative.clause’).
This construction is illustrated in the following examples:(642)                                       ̃́

it is part of. As such, /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’ cannot serve to emphasize negation,
which normally has scope over it, as in example (603) above, unless it occurs on
the negative word itself, as in (617) and (641) above.308
  308
     I have no simple explanation for why in the following examples /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’, while it is
suffixed to the negative words themselves, does not intensify negation as expected, but rather seems                                                                                                   535

"    I tentatively analyze the morpheme /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ as a verb root, although
it does not satisfy the definition of verb roots above insofar as it cannot occur in
discourse without incorporating a bound noun or an NP. This stressed morpheme,
which functions as a counterpart in the negative polarity of the morphosyntactically
regular verb root ã̄ ‘to have, to give’ (see Section 7.2.3), does not quite fit in any
morpheme class of the language.",[295]
"    Possibly the only genuinely irregular exception to the pattern of syllabic har-
mony for surface nasality in the language occurs in the particle used for stan-
dard negation, which is typically realized as [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ]30 (on the standard neg-
ative particle, see Section 7.2.1). The anomalous co-occurrence of a non-nasal
segment [t ̪] with a nasal diphthong [ã͡ʊ̃] within a single syllable in this high-
frequency morpheme clearly results from its historical origin as a phonological re-
duction of /ta34 ʔu4 ∼ʔɯ4 / [ˈt ̪aː34 ʔu4 ʔɯ̃ 4 ] ‘nothing’ (this non-reduced form still exists
in the language, but exclusively with a function of negative existential indefinite,
i.e. not that of standard negator; see Section 7.3). The phonological nasality of
the last syllable of the original form /ta34 ʔu4 ∼ʔɯ4 / has been retained in today’s
phonologically-reduced monosyllabic form [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ34       ̃ ], giving rise to an anomalous
case of a nasality-wise disharmonic syllable. Interestingly, certain speakers tend to
denasalize
[(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ] (whose exact phonological representation is unclear under the analysis
of nasality put forward in this section) to [(ˈ)t ̪a͡ʊ34 ], a phonologically unsurprising
reaction that results in the regularization of the phonetic and phonological forms of
the standard negator ([(ˈ)t ̪a͡ʊ34 ], by contrast with [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ], can be straightforwardly
represented phonologically as /tau34 / under the analysis of nasality put forward in
this section).",[93]

        B220–222]    Rhetorical questions are often used to convey an emphatic negative excla-
mative meaning. In this discursive strategy, the referent asked about is implicitly
meant not to exist, or in other words an interrogative word is used instead of its
corresponding negative existential indefinite (as in e.g. ‘What did he do…?’ =
‘He did (absolutely) nothing!’). This is illustrated in examples (657–658) (see also
(T56)). Compare (657) with (622) for a parallel utterance featuring the correspond-
ing explicitly negative construction. In (658), the corresponding negative sentence
is uttered immediately after the rhetorical question, yielding a binary discursive
structure interrogative.sentence+negative.sentence of relatively common

the myth of Ngutapa as told by Loida
Ángel RuizThis appendix provides a fully interlinearized transcription of about two thirds of
a recording of the first few episodes of the mythological cycle of Ngutapa and
his children as told by Loida Ángel Ruiz (lar, ♀, 49 y.o.). The corresponding
recording (recording C by lar in Table 1) was made on November 5, 2016 in
lar’s house in sma. This recording is 35’17” long altogether, of which the first
21’55” are transcribed in what follows. This entirely monological text is generally
representative of traditional Tikuna mythological storytelling. Note, however, that
I was the only hearer present during most of the performance, which is a highly
unusual speech setting for this kind of Tikuna verbal art.","[546, 547, 548, 549, 550]"

have’, tåʼúgù ‘never’, etc.) would be regularly expected in a full negative clause,
   ̊ ‘neg’ (or its variant tãu
tãu                            ̊ ʼü̃́) can work as a universal pro-sentential negation
marker, much like English ‘no!’. Thus, in example (647) (repeated from (635)
above, although with a more literal translation), while in fact privative negation
is involved (which could have triggered the use of the specialized privative verb
/g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ in the pro-sentential part of the speaker’s answer), the less specific
negation marker tãů ‘neg’ is used instead of /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ (here under its irregular
combinatorial variant tåmā, for /tãu   ̊ =mā/ ‘neg-precisely’; see Section 7.5 above):

    Note that when the remaining negative word is tãů ‘neg’, it may indeed be re-
alized as tãů , but it also frequently occurs under its conservative variant tãů ʼü̃́
(while this variant is marginal in full clauses; see Section 7.2.1 above), as in exam-
ples (644–645). By contrast, it does not seem to be able to occur under its innovative
denasalized variant tåu. This phonological conservatism of the pro-sentential use                                                                                          537
7. Negation
of tãů ‘neg’, as compared to its ordinary clausal use, is likely due to the fact that tãů
‘neg’ is normally left unstressed in the latter use, while it obligatorily bears stress
in the former.","[541, 542, 543]"
"   Note that due to this, there is no language-internal way to tell whether it is a
[–voice] consonant phoneme (e.g. a /p/) or a [+voice] consonant phoneme (e.g.
a /b/) that underlies a given nasal consonant on the surface (e.g. an [m]). In
other words, there is no language-internal way to decide whether a syllable such as
   30
     Note, incidentally, that the surface nasality that occurs in the first syllable of the more con-
servative variant [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ʔɯ̃ 4 ] of the standard negative particle is unproblematic as it can be ac-
counted for as a case of anticipatory nasality spreading (on this purely phonetic phenomenon, see
Section 2.1.2, p.73).",[93]

                             participant relativizations          ‘None [i.e. of the cities(.n) of Colombia] I’ve been to.’ [jsg B580]    A second group of negative existential indefinites exists, which can be inter-
preted as partially lexicalized forms replacing tåʼúʼü̃́ in cases where it has a
very general meaning ‘nothing’. This group of negative existential indefinites is
morphologically built as combinations of /tåʼú-/ ‘nothing’303 with a case suffix or a
relational noun. The ones attested in my data are listed in Table 51 (but note that
there is likely to be a few more than these, with other case suffixes or relational
nouns).304   By contrast to the previously discussed negative existential indefinites, which
can function as modifiers or modified heads, these /tåʼú/-based negative existential
indefinites always constitute entire arguments on their own, i.e. they may not
modify, nor be modified by, any other word. The following example illustrates
the ordinary use of one of them, /tåʼú-ʼǖ̃/ ‘be.absent\sbjv?-acc’:
  303
      This morpheme /tåʼú-/ ‘nothing’ probably comes from a former zero-derived nominalization of
the verb tåʼu ‘be absent’. Note, however, that by this etymological interpretation /tåʼú-/’s current
shape would appear to be tonologically slightly irregular, and one would have expected a form
*/tåʼu-/ (i.e. a form *[ˈt ̞aː34 ʔu 3 ...], featuring a tone [3 ], not [4 ], on its second surface syllable)
instead.
  304
      Anderson & Anderson (2016:218-219) also register the related forms tax2 u2 ma3 ‘nothing’ (i.e.
/tåʼú=mā/ ‘nothing=precisely’ in my analysis), tax2 u2 cax5 ma3 ‘for nothing’ (i.e. /tåʼú-ka̰=mā/
‘nothing-cause=precisely’) and tax2 u2 cü2 rü2 wa1 ‘cannot’ (i.e. /tåʼú-kǘrǘwa̋/ ‘nothing-since?’) in
the Cushillococha Tikuna variety. These, and possibly more, might also exist in the smat variety.","[532, 533, 534]"

reduction from tåʼúgù itself; on the origin of the variant tågù, see also Section 7.5
and note 307 below). Note also that tåʼúak̃̀ ǜ ‘cannot, may not’ (lit. ‘no way’) is

general impossibility (see e.g. (T117)).","[534, 535]"

"    Tãů ‘neg’, a phonologically anomalous word in that its only syllable combines
an oral onset together with a nasal nucleus, is likely to have arisen etymologically
from a phonetic reduction of /tåʼú-ʼü̃́/ ‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ (lit. ‘(a/the)
non-existing’), i.e. the regular subject participant relativization in the non-salien-
tive nominal class of the negative existential verb tåʼu ‘be absent’. /Tåʼú-ʼǘ̃/ ‘be.
absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ is in fact still used in its unreduced form to express meanings
such as ‘no X, none, nothing, nobody’ (see Section 7.3 below). It is unclear, how-
ever, through what kind of grammaticalization path a relativization like /tåʼú-ʼǘ̃/
‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ may have ended up functioning as the most general nega-
tive marker in smat.",[527]

"   The reasons why I tentatively analyze these two subsystems of locative partici-
pant indexation and partitive object participant indexation as belonging to the same
morphosyntactic slot are because 1) they never co-occur within the same inflected
predicative phrase in my data (negative evidence) and 2) they appear to share
one morpheme, specifically /ne̋=/ (and possibly its subdialectal variant /nű=/),
which is featured in both subsystems although with different functions (positive
but uncertain evidence). This question could probably be easily settled by further
research.",[464]

7.9       Pragmatic uses of negation in interaction
    Interro-negative questions with /=tá/ ‘fut’, as in (654), or /=chi ́/ ‘irr’, as
in (655), are often pragmatically used for suggestion or invitation (‘Won’t you/
they …?’ = ‘I suggest you/they ….’; see also example (609) above):(654)     Tãů tá kū-chi ́bü?̀

deliberately vague way, out of self-effacement (in which case tãů is often followed
by a more precise answer) or in order to elude a question (‘Well, nothing special,
(it’s just that …)’), as in the following example (repeated from (450)):312(656)     “Åkǘka̰ kū-dău?” ñâʼü.̃́ “Tãů , tére̋ í méʼkür̋ àʼükǖ

     This pragmatic use of tãů ‘neg’ is likely related to the fact that tãů probably comes from tåʼúʼü̃́

continuously (in cases where the process referred to is atelic, as in (369–372)).
The resulting predicative phrase can be correspondingly translated into English as
‘to always/often X, to X all the time/continuously/a lot, to keep X-ing, to spend

by itself convey notions of phasal polarity like those expressed by English ‘still’ or
‘yet’ (such notions are conveyed in smat by the enclitic /=tàa/̃̄ ‘itself’). That is,

"    Given the binary organization of part of the smat system of FGC suffixes in
pairs of suffixes respectively encoding the positive value and the negative value
of specific types of topological relations (e.g. /-ku̽chi ́, -ku̽/ [+containment] vs
/-ʼV̽chi ́, -ʼü̃̽/ [-containment]; /-V̄chi ̀/ [+propinquity] vs /-gàchi ̀/ [-propinquity]),
one may wonder whether /-yé/, if it is rightly classified as a FGC suffix, could not
be, in fact, the counterpart of the plurilocal suffix /-a̽/ (on which see the previous
section). Perhaps /-yé/ and /-a̽/ respectively denote the opposite values [singular]
and [plural] of a more general type of topological relation that one might label
[topological number]. If this hypothesis is correct, then the semantic contribution
of /-yé/ in (312) would not be to indicate that the skein was cut in its middle part
(so as to split in two halves of approximately equal size), but that it was cut in a
single cut (so as to split in two parts and no more than two). More data on this
suffix are needed to confirm or invalidate this speculative but plausible hypothesis.",[315]

"   Aspects of smat grammar that might currently be of particular interest to
typologists are the language’s rich tonological system (see Sections 2.4, 2.6.2,
and 2.7.3), its system of nominal classes characterized by obligatory agreement but
                                                                                  51

coding of predicative—or “conjugation”—class; note that none of these functions
relates to tense, aspect, or mood). The functional distribution of the three Inflec-
tional Types (Indicative, Imperative, and Subjunctive Inflectional Types), which
constitute the three values of the last inflectional category of the smat PP, is de-
scribed next. The encoding of Inflectional Type does not possess a specific locus
within the inflectional template of the PP, but is expressed instead through the use
of one or the other of the three slightly different paradigms of morphemes that
are available in certain slots of the template. The chapter proceeds to give a de-
tailed formal account of the inflectional morphology of the slots of the template
whose paradigms vary as a function of Inflectional Type, followed by an account
of the morphology of the slots whose paradigms remain identical across the three
Inflectional Types. It closes with functional discussions of two of the grammati-
cal categories encoded in the inflection of the PP in smat (associated motion and
predicative class), and a discussion of the various strategies—inflectional or not—
by which the language may encode the number feature of participants from within
the PP.","[56, 57, 58]"
"   Crucially, note that the inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase does
not directly encode any notions of tense, aspect, mood, or evidentiality (to
the exception—arguably—of the progressive aspect, on which see Section 5.7.2.1,
p.462). Such notions are mostly encoded by means of derivational suffixes of the
predicative phrase (see Section 4.4), clause-level enclitics and particles, or, in the
388
case of tense specifically, within nominal constituents via the inflection of certain
word classes for nominal tense.","[393, 394]"
"   Thus, in example (534), the presence of /nű=/ explicitly indicates that the
speaker did not literally go everywhere in the region, but to most places in the
region, in a spontaneous and cumulative fashion, rather than in an organized and

           770]Likewise, in (535), the presence of /nű=/ indicates that Peta-Peta did not literally
examine all the parts of the body of the Tikuna man, but most of its parts:278
 278
       The subtle shade of meaning contributed by /ne̋=/nű=/ ‘3n.part.obj’ in this construction is                                                                                              469

that this grammatical category is particularly common in the languages of the west-
ern half of the Amazonian basin, among which it is highly likely to have spread by
contact (2016). Associated motion in smat is a semantically fairly simple category
that essentially contributes meanings such as ‘go/come (i.e. undergo a motion
unspecified for path) and perform the main process denoted by the lexical
component of the predicative phrase’, as shown in the following example:(536)   “Ngü,̂ chā-pūrākǘã̰ níì-ĩ ̊ rǜ kǘ chārǖ finca pēyàrǖ-chĕʼgü!̋ ” ñâʼü.̃́ Nge̋mà gá,

    This study is a typologically-informed description of a few major aspects of the
grammar of a variety of Tikuna, a language isolate spoken in western Amazonia
along the banks of the Amazon river. The Tikuna variety described in this work
is that of San Martín de Amacayacu, a community located near the southeastern
tip of Colombia. Its speakers typically refer to it as tăgà, lit. ‘our (incl.) language’
or ‘people’s language’, even when talking to foreigners. The grammatical topics
covered primarily include the phonological system of the language as well as the
morphosyntax and semantics of its predicative phrase. Additional grammatical
domains treated in less detail include aspects of the nominal phrase and the ex-
pression of negation. All the analyses I put forward in this description are based
on first-hand linguistic data that I have collected between 2015 and 2018 in San
Martín de Amacayacu with the help of native speakers of the language.","[30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

4.2.5.3      Pseudo-incorporation in possessive predication    Possessive predication of participants expressed as bound nouns exclusively op-

corporation and appears to incorporate the bound noun to the verb roots ã̄ ‘to
have’ (positive possessive predication) or g̃e-̊ ‘not have’ (negative possessive—
or privative—predication, on which see Section 7.2.3). Possessive predication of
participants expressed as NPs may similarly operate through a construction that is
formally identical with NP incorporation and involves the same two verb roots,
although in the case of participants expressed as NPs an alternative construction
involving non-verbal predication is available, and apparently preferred over NP in-
corporation to ã̄ or g̃e-̊ (on this alternative construction, see Section 4.3.3.6). Note,
however, that the incorporation-like constructions employed for possessive predi-
cation are not, strictly speaking, genuine incorporation given that their possessee
participant cannot be extracted from ã̄ or g̃e-̊ so as to be expressed as a separate,
syntactically independent nominal constituent. Furthermore, from a syntactico-
semantic perspective, these incorporation-like constructions do not quite fit with
any of the three functional types identified in the previous section. For these rea-
sons, I consider them as cases of pseudo-incorporation, rather than incorporation
proper.","[331, 332]"

Complex case 2: “negative indexation” of a fourth person subject
(second-to-last row in Charts J–M on pp.452–453). Fourth person sub-
jects in sbjv can be said to be encoded negatively. It is the absence of any subject
marking in slots 4 or 7, combined with the absence of any NP in subject position pre-
ceding the predicative phrase, that is interpreted as implying that the predicative
phrase has a fourth person subject. Fourth person subjects in sbjv are repre-
sented morphologically—so to say—as an absence of subject. When “index-
ation” of a fourth person subject occurs in sbjv, the last of the proclitics that
precede the predicative phrase is systematically imposed sbjv’s toneme /1 /
(which may, as in other cases discussed in this section, result in no change if the
last proclitic’s lexical toneme, i.e. the one it features in ind, is already /1 /).",[450]
"    However, in the speech of most speakers, sbjv-ʼü̃́ is regularly used in declara-
tive main clauses to present a process as constituting a new, salient step within
a temporal sequence of processes. sbjv-ʼü̃́ is then resorted to as a discursive de-
vice that allows the speaker to explicitly construct a clear temporal axis along which
major steps are grammatically signaled as such as they are being mentioned. Such
uses of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses could be roughly glossed by ‘at that
point, …’, as was done in the translation of example (448d) above. By contrast,
non-sequential processes, or minor sequential processes that the speaker does
not want to present as sequenced, are referred to with predicative phrases in ind.
In other words, predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ essentially correspond to those that
involve what I call advancement of narrative time ([+ant]), while predica-
tive phrases in ind essentially correspond to those that do not involve advance-
ment of narrative time ([-ant]). An important consequence is that predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses may not be uttered in a different
order without typically implying a different sequence for the processes referred to,
i.e. the ordering of [+ant] forms conditions the semantic interpretation of the
processes referred to. By contrast, predicative phrases in ind in declarative main
clauses may be uttered in a different order with no direct implication as to the se-
quence of the processes referred to, i.e. the ordering of [-ant] forms has no effect
on the semantic interpretation of the processes referred to. Note that the order-
ing of [-ant] forms does, by contrast, condition the discursive—more specifically,
the rhetorical—interpretation of utterances, as it obviously has direct effects on
the order in which the information is delivered and construed and the way it is
rhetorically organized.259
  259
      Thus in example (451) below, which contains three main clauses in ind, the enacted speaker
chooses to first make a more generic announcement (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) and then pro-
ceeds to make a more specific elaboration on it in the next two utterances (‘I’ll shoot some brown
woolly monkeys. I’ll go woolly-monkey-hunting.’). With the exact same semantic meaning, the
first utterance (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) could presumably have been uttered last, but then that
semantically more generic utterance would have been construed as a summary restatement of the
more specific announcement made in the previous two utterances, yielding a different rhetorical
structure from the one actually at play in (451). Likewise, in (450) below, the ordering of the three
clauses in ind in the answer (‘I’ve shot a beautiful tére̋ parrot, it has fallen down here but I can’t
find it.’) could in principle be altered (as in e.g. ‘A beautiful tére̋ parrot has fallen down here, but
I can’t find it, [in fact] I’ve shot it.’) with no consequences as to their semantic interpretation, but

                                    5.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
    Typical discourse genres where the ind vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast is exploited are
narratives (whether set in a remote past and unrelated to the discourse partici-
pants—myths, legends, tales, etc.—or set in a relatively recent past and related to
the discourse participants—life stories, anecdotes, etc.) and procedural discourse
(cooking recipes, descriptions of craft techniques, chronologically-ordered descrip-
tions of the typical activities carried out in a given period of time, etc.). In these
discourse genres, while predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are used to orderly unroll the
series of major events (or steps to be conducted), predicative phrases in ind are gen-
erally employed with one or several of the following six main discursive functions
(the simple illustrative contexts of use in parentheses are made up examples that
parallel actual occurrences in my corpus; actual examples are provided below):260    – locating a major event in space or time (e.g. ‘The next day came.ind. Then
      he went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ into the jungle.’);    – mentioning preliminary minor events (e.g. ‘He eventually spotted.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a
      monkey. He came closer.ind and he shot.sbjv-ʼü̃́ it.’);    – recapitulating a previous major event (e.g. ‘And then he came down.sbjv-ʼü̃́.
      So, he came down.ind, and then he started.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to speak.’);261
such alterations would affect the rhetorical relations that bind them into a small discourse unit.
In practice, in (450), the rhetorical principle that guides the ordering of the clauses in ind under
scrutiny is temporal iconicity, but the use of ind in these clauses indicates that establishing a clear
temporal axis is not essential to the purposes of the enacted speaker at that moment.
  260
     Interestingly, when they fulfill one of the first three functions in this list, main declarative
clauses containing a predicative phrase in ind are often explicitly topicalized by means of a topic
marker (/=i ̀/ ‘contr.top’ in non-past contexts or /=gá/ ‘pst’ in past contexts) attached at their
right edge (as in examples (454a) and (455e) below). This clause-level topicalization process could
in fact be argued to turn these clauses into near-dependent clauses (as opposed to genuinely inde-
pendent main clauses). Note further that all of the six functions in this list are somehow related to
topical (i.e. already known or backgrounded) information, as opposed to the more focal (i.e. un-
known or foregrounded) information typically conveyed by declarative main clauses containing a
predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́.
  261
      The use of such recapitulating clauses for discourse cohesion is frequent in narratives and proce-
dural discourse in smat. These recapitulating clauses are of two major formal and functional types.
Some include the predicative phrase of the recapitulated clause more or less verbatim (“recapitulat-
ing linkage” proper in Aikhenvald (2019)’s terminology). These verbatim (or specific) recapitulating
clauses typically provide linkage from one sentence to the next within a single paragraph and often
imply that the two main processes referred to are temporally close to each other (see e.g. exam-
ples (454a–454b) below). Other much more formulaic recapitulating clauses feature an anaphoric
word referring to the processes to be recapitulated (/ngē-mà/ ‘med.ns-anaph’ in past or non-past
                                                                                                   401

    – initiating a series of major events (e.g. ‘Once upon a time, a man went.ind
      into the jungle. There he found.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a deer.’);    – elaborating on specific aspects of a major event occurring at the same ref-
      erence time (e.g. ‘And then they had.sbjv-ʼü̃́ dinner. They chatted.ind, they
      drank.ind [i.e. while eating]. Then they went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to bed.);    – describing participants of a major event (e.g. ‘The canoe was large.ind.’).","[405, 406, 407]"

"   The spatial relations encoded by the FGC suffixes may be relations tended to-
wards over the course of the process or achieved at the end of the process.
This depends on the Aktionsart properties of the verb root. Spontaneous and caused
motion verb roots, in particular, with which the FGC suffixes co-occur in an over-
whelming majority of cases in discourse (although these suffixes may also occur on
non-motion verb roots), are lexically distributed in a durative and a non-durative

stands at the initial phase of the process).    /-ègù/ ‘inv’ does not denote a specific subtype of topological relation but indi-
cates instead that the topological relation prevailing at the initial phase of the
process is inverted in the process, i.e. shifts from plus to minus or the other way
around (whereby the figure ‘gets to be or tends towards being generally contiguous
with the ground while it was initially not contiguous with it’, ‘gets to be or tends
towards being at the ground while it was initially away from it’, ‘gets to be or tends
towards being off the ground while it was initially on it’, etc.). This suffix thus
essentially functions as an inverter of topological relation polarity. In cases where
the figure coincides with the ground, /-ègù/ indicates that the figure gets to stand
or tends towards standing in a reversed orientation by reference to a plane tangent
to it or intersecting it (e.g. ‘the poster is hanging backwards’, ‘the canoe capsized’,
‘I put the glass upside down’, ‘I turned my pants inside out’).   /-a̽/ ‘plloc’ denotes a plural topological relation (whereby the figure ‘gets

3. The nominal phrase
3.1.3       Introduction to the inflectional category of
            nominal tense
    Nominal tense is a grammatical category that is expressed in the inflectional
paradigms of the non-locative and locative endophoric demonstrative words
(see Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.3), the ngē-/ye̊- words (a small class of words that are
historically derived from the non-locative demonstrative roots; see Section 3.4.8),
and the linker (see Section 3.5.1). The category of nominal tense in smat has two
values, which can be labeled as [-past/unspecified] and [+past], respectively.
A distinction has to be made between older and younger speakers as to how these
two values are put to use.","[192, 193]"
