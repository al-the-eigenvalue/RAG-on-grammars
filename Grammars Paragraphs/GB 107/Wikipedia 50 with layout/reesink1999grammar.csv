4.4.9 Position of negative   Hatam has two negatives: big 'not' for negation of declaratives and interrogatives, and au
'don't' (in Indonesian janga n) for imperatives. Both negative adverbs are always in clause­
final position. Only question particles e or i may follow.
     (4.90)     Ieni ji-ttei        hab hi        big    e?
                you    2PL-carry bird other not          Q
                You didn't bring a bird, did you?",[112]

     The nominalised phrase -ngon kan-ti, consisting of the inalienable body part ngon 'heart' and the verb kan
     'know', expresses 'wish, intention'.
112    Ger P. Reesink   The point of all these examples is to illustrate that, although some structures seem to
prefer one interpretation of scope of negation over others, they are all inherently opaque. This
seems to be a necessary consequence of the nature of negation, especially in a language such
as Hatam where the position of the negative adverb is rigidly sentence-final. Thus, scope of
negation cannot give evidence about the status of these constructions. Whereas the sequences
involving directional verbs have morphological indications that they are different from
coordinated constructions (that is, if the purposive bi- qualifies as a coordinating conjunction)
or constructions involving complement clauses, negation operates in a similar way on all of
them.","[127, 128]"
"Interpretation (b) is the most available one, which is not very surprising, considering the
pragmatics of negation. Universally, it is the adverbial (whether adverb or prepositional
phrase or subordinate clause) which is the first candidate for the scope of negation. She
doesn 't run fast has as its first interpretation 'she runs but not fast'. The logically possible
interpretation 'she doesn't run' is available, but less likely. Why would a speaker supply
more, modifying information about an event that s/he is going to negate anyway? Similar
hierarchies of interpretations are valid for the other negative sequences.",[124]
"In other words, these two instances of negated purposive sequences yield conflicting results.
In (4. 1 47) 'hit pig die not', the preferred scope of negation concerns the result, i.e. V2,
whereas in (4. 1 48) '(x) draw water (y) drink not', the interpretation of the scope of negation
focuses on the first conjunct, and leaves the purpose in tact. It seems that the preferred
interpretation of the negative fluctuates with a purposive or a resultative reading of the
sequence.",[126]
"
4.5. 62 Negation and directional sequences 0)  This category comprises structures in which V I is a directional verb followed by an
unprefixed main verb:
      (4. 1 44) (a) Yoni y-ug       bong ei          ig-bei        big,
                    they 3PL-go sleep LOC house-under not
                    They don't go (to) sleep in the house (at home),can be followed by:
                                                                                              Syntax         1 09              (b) nOTO y-ug          bong ei          bigbehei.
                  but     3PL-go sleep LOC forest
                  but they go to sleep in the forest.              (c) Zeu-o        yoni i-bong         ei      igbei    tu.
                  from-ALT they 3PL-sleep LOC house already
                  because they are already sleeping in the house.lsAgain, interpretation (b) is the first given when informants are asked what the negative
sentence means. But (c), which restricts the scope of negation to the directional verb, is
available.","[124, 125]"
"4.5. 6 1 Negation and adverbial sequences
      (4. 1 43) (a) Munggwom dima i-pim              i-nggum        big,
                    child          that   3PL-cry 3PL-hungry not
                    Those children are not crying (because) they are hungry,The scope of the negative can be shown by possible continuations of this sentence. Both
(4. 1 43b) and (4. 1 43c) are possible:      (4. 1 43) (b) noro i-pim         i-nggobiau.
                    but     3PL-cry 3PL-thirsty
                    but they are crying (because) they are thirsty.                  (c) noro     i-pa .
                      but      3PL-Iaugh
                      but they are laughing.",[124]
"4.5. 6. 7 Negation and perception verb + complement   In the case of perception verbs with complements, both readings of the negative are
equally available. However, the preferred scope of negation, as indicated by the first
translation given by informants, is the main predicate, as in reading (a) of (4. 1 52):
     (4. 1 52)        Ni-cig     0-kan            (bi-)pia   nip-misop
                      3SG-father 3SG-know         (pUR-)QUOT 3SG-daughter
                       ni-ngon   ngakei pinai pima big.
                       3SG-heart love    man that       not
                       (a) Her father doesn't know that his daughter loves that man.
                       (b) Her father knows that his daughter doesn't love the man.
    Even if pragmatically some meanings are less likely, negation of main verb or
complement is equally possible for such constructions. For example, (4. 1 4 1 ), repeated as
(4. 1 53), would be more easily used for a situation where the 'seeing' needs to be denied than
where the seeing involves a negated event.
     (4. 1 5 3)       Dani   di-ngat nab yem dit-de              bikau      big.
                      I       l SG-see pig eat l SG-POS sw.potato not
                      (a) I did not see that the pig ate my sweet potatoes.
                      (b) I saw that the pig did not eat my sweet potatoes.",[127]
"
3. 13.5 Sentence-final adverbs   Although some adverbs, such as cem 'also' and bu 'again' are often found in clause-final
position, they can also occur in other positions, as seen in example (3. 1 79). The negative
adverbs big 'not' and au 'must/should not' and the phasal aspect adverbs tu (su) 'already' and
yo 'still, yet', as also in combination with big in bigyo 'not yet', are always in a final position:
   (3. 1 8 1 )   Lene ni-ngat      mbrei       hi      big-yo.
                 then  l EXC-see foreigner other not-yet
                 And we had not yet seen any foreigner.
   For consequences on possible interpretations of negative sentences, see §4.S.6.",[89]
"     (4.9 1 )   Ii-teu      tibor   au.
                2PL-grab arrow don't
                Don't grab your (bow and) arrows.
  Negation can be intensified to convey the sense of 'not at all' , 'by no means', by
combining the perception verb kan 'know' with the negative:
     (4.92)     Njap gom dem             mem ni-pilei           hab can kan       big.
                day   one    enough for         1 EXC-shoot bird two know not
                One day was not at all enough for us to shoot two birds. [Wonggor 1 .0 1 3 ]
    When both tulsu 'already' and big 'not' are clause-final, the question i s what happens
when both are present. The combination tulsu big does not occur. The realisation of 'not yet'
is by big + yo 'still', as in example (4.93). The reversed sequence does occur as in (4.94).
     (4.93)     Yoni i-kwei        ei     Mar      big-yo.
                they 3PL-come LOC Warmare not-yet
                They have not yet come to Warmare.

                   pig    ANA-that move                 not     already
                   That pig no longer moved.9
     See §4.5.6 for the scope of negation.","[112, 113]"

     Similarly, miap 'hear' can have either a nominal object, modified by a relative clause, as
 in (4. 1 29) or the total event as its object, as a full clause in (4. 1 30).
    (4. 1 29)   A-miap     di-sut-bat-nya         di-no       i-mbrab             e?

                    Did you hear my friends talking?
   The clausal complement of miap 'hear' is optionally, that of kan 'thinklknow' obligatorily
introduced with the complementiser pia:
     (4. 1 3 1 )    Di-kan            pia  dip-misop                ni-ngon   ngakei
                    l SG-know         QUOT l SG-daughter            3SG-heart (?)
                    pinai pima big.
                    man that      not
                    I do not know whether my daughter loves that man. 16
   The complementiser pia is glossed as QUOTE, since it is almost always present to
introduce quoted speech, whether direct or indirect; see examples (4 . 1 32a) and (4. 1 32b). The
difference between direct and indirect speech is signalled only by the shift in person category
of the pronoun(s) in the quote:
     (4. 1 32) (a) Annani            dani      di-pai   bak nom          pia
                   yesterday         I         l SG-say to  him          QUOT
                    nani suar a-wim          miai.
                    you    need 2SG-cut garden
                    Yesterday I told him, you have to cut the garden.               (b) Annani            dani      di-pai   bak        nom    pia
                   yesterday         I         l SG-say to         him    QUOT
                    nom suar 0-wim            miai.
                    he     need 3SG-cut garden
                    Yesterday I told him that he had to cut the garden.
   Another example of indirect speech employs the prefixed QUOTE marker bi-pia, which I
interpret as an instance of the instrument prefix, since a purposive would be followed by
subject prefix (if/when applicable)'7:
     (4. 1 3 3)     I-hig     ser      bi-pia   -ndo                     i-ntun       him

                    (If) we inquire that he show us their exact place of origin, they will show (it) to
                    us. [Yairus 026]   Direct speech would have had a-ndo '2SG-show' instead of 0-ndo '3SG-show', following
bi-pia . Compare the direct and indirect speech variants of the event 'pig bites youlher' in
examples (4. 1 34a) and (4. 1 34b), both unelicited, taken from the Kwanding myth:
16
     This sentence can also mean 'I know that my daughter does not love that man'. For further discussion of
     scope of negative see §4.5.6. For ngon ngakei 'love' see §3.4.5.
17   In example (4. 1 33) it could be that third person plural has disappeared through assimilation. But if the
     subject were first person singular, for example, one would get:           di-hig ser bi-pia.. . and not: *di-hig ser bi-di-pia.

               'seduce') [Kwanding 068]When Kwanding has left and her sisters-in-law arrive on the scene and ask about her,

    Other speech verbs using (bi-)pia include hig 'to ask', hara 'to request; call out' and jem
'to call'. The latter uses (bi-)pia 'QUOTE' when it refers to naming persons or objects, as in:
   (4. 1 35)   Gi-ma         i-ba    ni-hyet       Mor           i-jem

               That one they call in Indonesian Burung Pintar (= Bowerbird). [Wonggor
               1 :005]Without the quote marker, this verb functions in a similar structure as perception verbs or
'manipulative' verbs, such as nduk 'to gather' (compare example (4. 1 1 0). Consider:   (4. 1 36)   Apino     0-jem         yok     i-kwei   ndam          noni

               kinds of produce) . . . [Yairus 2:037]
4.5.5 Generaljuxtaposition    As the examples in the introduction to this section show, juxtaposition of verbal predicates
is not restricted to the Directional, Instrumental, Purposive and Perception/Speech
complements. As far as I can tell, juxtaposition of verbal predicates -with or without explicit
object NPs in the case of transitive verbs -always involves a same subject sequence. This
'rule' excludes perception and speech verbs as V I , as we have seen. Secondly, juxtaposed
verbs are always both marked with a subject prefix, when applicable. This 'rule' excludes
i) verbs immediately following Directional verbs, ii) Directional verbs specifying direction for
main verbs and iii) optionally, V2's of Instrumental sequences. But even juxtaposed
                                                                                          Syntax     1 07directional verbs can be prefixed, as can be seen in i-nang y-ug 'they fled and went' in
[Yairus 2:067] (see footnote 1 1 above), and in another instance of intransitive verbs in series:
       (4. 1 3 7)          Sop        cin    idnJ2.J&1.
                                                      i -kwei         su
                           woman      pair   3PL-walk 3PL-come        already
                           {2}-hon     srin   ei    Mbingwam.
                           3SG-stop block LOC Mbingwam

                           Mbingwam. [Anggos 033]
   Some sequences of intransitive verbs could be interpreted as V2 being an adverbial
modifier of V I . Such sequences do not allow an intervening conjunction ba 'and', as shown
by example (4.96), repeated here as (4. 1 3 8); (4. 1 3 8b) is unacceptable.
       (4. 1 3 8) (a) Ni-hara     ni-nggum . . .
                      l EXC-ask l EXC-hungry
                      We ask (because) we are hungry ...
                           *
                     (b)    ni-hara    ba    ni-nggum
   Sequences of transitive verbs are simply tight temporal sequences, which in contrast with
'adverbial sequences' can easily be conjoined by ba 'and':
       (4. 1 39)           I-ttei     njinta (ba) i-biak            yok.
                           3PL-take food       (and) 3PL-host them
                           They take food (and) host (= put on a big meal) them. [Dowansiba 06 1 ]
4.5. 6 Scope of negation   As mentioned in §4.4.9, the negative adverb big (as well as negative imperative au) is
always in clause-final position. I should say rather that it occurs sentence-finally, because, as
seen in example (4. 1 3 1 ) above, negation of a perception verb is effected by big following the
complement clause. It is ungrammatical to have the negative in between the main predicate
and its complement:
       (4. 1 40)           *Dani di-ngat big             nab yem dit-de       siep.
                           I         I SG-see not        pig eat     I SG-POS sw.potato
                           I didn't see that the pig ate my sweet potatoes.
   The strictly final position of the negative implies that any negative sentence consisting of
more than one clause allows more than one interpretation, depending on whether the scope of
the negation includes the main or the subordinate predicate. Consider:
       (4. 1 4 1 )         Dani   di-ngat nab             yem   dit-de   bikau        big.
                           I      I SG-see pig            eat   I SG-POS sw.potato    notThis sentence can have two readings:(i)        I didn't see (that) the pig ate my sweet potatoes.
(ii)       I saw (that) the pig didn't eat my sweet potatoes.
Likewise:
108       Ger P. Reesink      (4. 1 42)       Dani   di-miap     (pia)      yoni    sisip i-mbrab      big.

(ii) I don' t hear them talking. (= They may be talking but I don' t hear them.)
    Disambiguation of examples (4. 1 4 1 ) and (4 . 1 42) is possible only on pragmatic grounds.
Not only negative sentences involving perception complements are semantically opaque. The
various verb sequences described in §4.S. 1 -§4.S.S allow similar multiple interpretations,
albeit that some interpretations are more easily available than others. Consider the following
examples: (i) adverbial, (ii) directional verb plus main, (iii) main verb plus directional, (iv)
instrumental, (v) resultative, (vi) speech and (vii) perception verbs with their complements
under negation.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124]"
"
4.5. 6. 6 Negation and speech verb + complement   Similarly, different interpretations of the scope of negation are possible for negative
sentences with a speech verb as main predicate. Consider:
     (4. 1 49) (a) Noni 0-jem       da di-kwei         big
                   he     3SG-call me 1 SG-come not
                   He called me to come but I didn't come
19   Hans Iwou interpretes (4. 1 46a) as That (means) one does not use a machete to fell the tree, but one uses
     something else'. He also claims that (4. 1 46b), that is di·ba hamboi di·bi·wim biei nora di·wim big 'I took a
     machete to fell the tree but 1 didn't fell it' should make a possibility or wish explicit, as in:
          Di·pi            bi·di·ba             hamboi       wim       biei
          I SG·intend      PUR· ! SG·use        machete      fell      tree
          noro     di·wim       big.
          but      I SG· fell   not
          I intended to use a machete to fell the tree, but I didn't fell (it).
                                                                                            Syntax         111This is the first interpretation given by informants, similar to '(x) hit pig but it didn't die'.
However, it can also be continued by:                   (b) norD di-ngon       kan-ti           mem      di-kwei.
                       but     l SG-heart know-NOM         for      l SG-come
                       but I came on my own accord.20
   The same order of interpretations is valid for example (4. 1 50), which differs from (4. 1 49)
only in the presence of the purposive marker on the second conjunct.
     (4. 1 50)         Noni   0-jem     da    bi-di-kwei      big.
                       s/he   3SG-call me PUR - 1 SG-come not
                       (a)    He didn't call me to come.
                       (b)    He called me but I didn't come.
   Contrary to (4. 1 49) and (4. 1 50), the interpretation of (4. 1 5 1 ) applies the negation only to
the first predicate: 'He did not invite me or call me (to come)':
     (4. 1 5 1 )       Noni 0-jem          da kwei big.
                       he     3SG-call me come not
                       He didn't call me to come.","[126, 127]"
"Thus, the first interpretation of (4. 1 47) is 'I hit the pig but it didn't die'. However, 'I didn't hit
the pig, but it died of another cause' is also possible. On the other hand, for the negative
sentence (4. 1 48), the preferred interpretation is 'They didn't draw water for me to drink'.",[126]
"3.12 Question words3. 12. 1 Polar question markers   Polar questions can be formed without any overt morphological marking, as long as the
intonation is rising. But generally, either of two question markers, e or i, is used. Both
question markers are utterance-final clitics. The marker i (which is homophonous, if not
identical, to the element 'yes' = i or iyo, presumably 'yes' + 0 'inclusive disjunction') seems to
be the more general, since it also occurs on content questions.
   The difference between -e and - i lies in expectations on the part of the speaker.
Informants characterised the contrast in terms of e requiring a quick answer and i marking
questions in general. When a positive -i.e. agreeing-answer is expected, -e is used, as in
examples (3. 1 47) and (3 . 1 4 8).

morphemes. The second speaker, Yulius, inserts a schwa between the subject noun biged and
the predicate but, which resyllabifies [b<}.g£.d<}.but]. Yakonias' but.big forms a iamb even
though both syllables are of equal length. Likewise, Yulius' big ba forms a iamb. Significant
is that both instances of iambs last about 300 msec. Interestingly, the verb but 'fall (of rain)'
fonns the trough in the first example and the peak in the second one. Similarly, the negative
adverb is peak in the first, trough in the second one. The duration of these syllables is roughly
the same. But as the wave fonns in Figure 2.2 show, the lack of difference in length appears
to be compensated either by intensity, as the iamb [bi.ba] in the second example, or by pitch,
as [but.bi] in the first example. A preliminary conclusion would be, then, that Hatam fonns a
iambic metrum based on length: short-long. In case of syllables of roughly equal length, the
peak is phonetically realised by intensity or pitch.
36          Ger P. Reesink     The same speakers gave sentences (2.66) and (2.67); see Figures 2.3 and 2.4.

                  I didn't really hear that speech. 8Based upon this information, the conclusion can be drawn that example (4.83a) specifies that
the hiding is done in a quick manner, whereas in (4.8 3b) and (4.8 3c) the adverb is more
sentential: the action followed quickly on some earlier event.
    Similarly, the adverbs bu 'again' and cem 'also' may take various positions according to
the required scope. Consider some examples of cem. In (4.86) cem only has the subject dani
'I' in its scope, in (4.87) the predicate with object is focused on, and in (4. 8 8) it is just the
object dihyei 'ground' which is included as a further possible goal of what one can pay for
with kain timur 'ceremonial cloth'.

                  I also later I will have died (and you will build many houses). [Habel 2:0 1 4]8
    Although I stated as a rule that adverbs are not allowed between predicate and object, the text Dowansiba
    (57}-(58) has two instances of igbit 'true' in just that position, as in:         Munggworn         pi-rna            I-rnlap     igbit   i-cig        big.

                We used (kain timur) to buy ground also (in addition to paying for
                transgressions and to buy women). [Kain timur:037]
   Adverbial phrases or clauses which set the time (see §4 .4. 1 ) are either in initial position as
part of the clause, or they are actually outside the clause proper and linked to the main clause
by a clausal conjunction. In (4.48) above we saw an example with lene 'and, then'; here is
one with api 'then, subsequently':
     (4.89)     Njap di      he     bi-bu         api ni-yem          ba    ngwig.
                day    REL only INS-again then l EXC-eat and finish
                The next day then we ate (it) until it was finished. [Hans: 1 1 ]Adverbs that are always clause-final are the aspectual tulsu 'already' and the negatives. See
next section for interaction between these two.","[111, 112]"

   The Pacific Linguistics logo was
designed by Ian Scales after one
small panel of a poro batuna from
Vella La vella, held i n the
Australian Museum (A8 S 1 7). This
is an artefact made from a plaque
of fossilised giant clam shell
(Tridacna sp .), carved into an
elaborate fretwork design. These
particular artefacts were made in
the western Solomon I slands,
probably between 1 00 and 200
years ago.

          Acknowledgements    Research for this grammar was conducted in the framework of the Netherlands
Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) priority programme 'The Irian Jaya Studies: a
Programme for Interdisciplinary Research' (ISIR), financed by the Netherlands Foundation
for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO). The programme is carried out in
cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, The Indonesian Institute of
Sciences).
    I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan
Bahasa (National Centre for Language Development), for his willingness to be the sponsor of
the linguistic studies carried out under the auspices of ISIR.
    In order to study the Hatam language in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya I also needed
and readily obtained permission from the authorities in Jayapura, Irian Jaya, and more
specifically in the regency (Kabupaten) Manokwari. I thank the heads of Sospol (Direktorat
Jenderal Sosial Politik) and Bappeda (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah) for
their permission.
    But with just the permission and support of the governmental authorities it is hard to study
a regional language such as Hatam. During my first visit to Manokwari, Rogier Gruys gave
me many useful suggestions about whom I should contact. So, before I even travelled to
Hatam territory, I visited the office of World Wide Fund for Nature, where various Hatam
speakers were employed. The director, Daud Womsiwor, arranged for me to meet with
Yohanes Wonggor and Marinus Mandacan, both from Mokwam. They taught me a few
useful expressions in Hatam, and supplied me with a letter in Hatam about regulations for the
nature reserve. Yohanes read it on tape and gave me the meaning in Indonesian.
    In Minyambou I was welcomed by the missionaries of The Evangelical Alliance Mission,
Dick and Char Griffiths and Walter and Dianne Kennedy. My thanks are due to them for
their hospitality and their help. The TEAM director in Manokwari, Elmer Lorenz, graciously
allowed me to use the organization's address and infrastructure to keep in contact with people
in my home country.
   There is no way to learn a language without native speakers willing to teach. Many Hatam
people have been very friendly and helpful. They were willing to tell stories, which I recorded
and transcribed, or just provided words or sentences which I needed in order to make progress
with my analysis. Thanks are due to: andigpoi Tuantiei Dowansiba, and Yoas Wonggor,
Yoas Iwou, Yairus Dowansiba, Erens Morum, Isak Mandacan, Esap Iwou. In particular, the
texts from Tuantiei were not always easy to understand. Hans Iwou, principal of the primary
school in Minyambou, was a patient and astute teacher. He not only helped me understand
xii   Acknowledgementsthese difficult texts, but also was able to answer my many questions regarding morphological
and syntactic complexities. When he was not at Minyambou during my second visit in 1 995,
I found his cousins Yakonias Iwou and Yoas Iwou willing to help me with my questions. But
Hans Iwou, living then at Maruni, could again answer some remaining questions, when I
returned from Minyambou to Manokwari in December 1 995.
   Finally, I want to express my thanks to two anonymous referees and Bert Voorhoeve for
commenting on a first draft. In particular, Bert had gone through the manuscript with a fine­
tooth comb, and made many valuable suggestions. I want to thank Jelle Miedema, Dianne
van Oosterhout and Leontine Visser for comments on an earlier version of the
anthropological notes in the Introduction. I have benefited from comments by Harry van der
Hulst and Ian Maddieson on the phonology chapter. Cecilia Ode has helped me with the
measurements and printing the spectograms. None of these people are, of course, responsible
for the flaws that remain.

"2.10 Metrical stress    All lexical items, whether monosyllabic or polysyllabic, allow stress marking, including
CV verbs, such as jo 'be somewhere', ku 'to hide'; nouns, such as b u 'nettle leaf', mo
'shrimp' ; adverbs, such as bu 'again' , and function words, such as ei 'at; to' and ba 'and'.
As mentioned with regard to bisyllabic words, the first syllable is never stressed, except in
two instances. Firstly, the suffix -ni on personal pronouns can never receive stress. Thus dani
'1', nyeni 'we' are never [da. 'ni] or [fie . 'ni]. Secondly, the clitic -a on citation forms of nouns
may never receive stress:
     (2.57)     igya           Jig-aJ         house-IND             =   ['iy.ya]
                sara           Jsar-aJ        lattice-IND           =   ['sa.ra]     (2.58)     nungugw-a        [nu. 'IJu.gwa]    mountain
                guri-a           [gu. 'ri.ya]      chicken
    Notice that I formulated the stress rule for words in isolation in negative terms. Whereas
suffixed pronouns and monosyllabic nouns show a trochaic pattern, bisyllabic words with or
without a final clitic suggest a iambic pattern. But when these words occur in running speech,
no rule can positively specify which syllable should be assigned stress. Only negatively, first
syllables of polysyllabic words (whether mono- or poly morphemic) can never be stressed,
suggesting a phrasal iambic metrical stress. Accent in Hatam cannot be stated in terms of
word pattern. It is related to a whole utterance or phrasal part thereof. Following a pause, or a
single long syllable, such as the connective ba 'and', a trough comes (almost) always first, as
in:

                Its name is bijibugjem. And the cloth [kain timur] . . . [Kain timur:003J4]The qualification of 'almost' is necessary, since the free personal pronouns, when suffixed,
always have the first syllable stressed: da-ni 'I-this' etc.
   The sequence of iambs in Hatam seems to be quite regular and gives a distinctive
rhythmic impression. A sequence of bisyllabic words in an NP maintains stress on words of
different classes in the following:
                                                                                 Phonology     33   (2.60)

   Content words, like monosyllabic verbs or nouns, do not necessarily attract stress. It
apparently depends on the overall pattern in the clause. For example, in (2.6 1 ), which
answers the question where a certain item can be found, [no.jo] forms the first iamb, with /jo/
being the peak.
   (2.6 1 )

and their social organisation in different groups (or families) and land rights.
    Various sources suggest that the Hatam trace their origin to somewhere near the
headwaters of the Wariori river (rim PSL Uncen 1 989:7; Pouwer 1 95 8 :5 9), which in Hatam
is Udop. Perhaps this area was just an intermediate station during their travel from their
original homeland further south-west, where the Rawara and Timoforo rivers join into the
Sebjar (Pans 1 960:25, 4 1 ). According to the oral tradition, near the headwaters of the
Wariori river is a place called Sen Mimbran (sen 'sungai' = river; mimbran 'alang-alang' =
'tall, coarse grass', according to the folk etymology given in Uncen 1 989 :5), where a short
snake lived in a cave, looking after a dog, Rinyap. Although the origin story of the Iwou
family which I obtained is quite short and leaves a number of events unexplained, it does
agree with information given in the Uncen report and the accounts in both Pouwer and Pans.
A number of Hatam families trace their descent to the short snake, for example the Iwou
(wou(k) = 'snake') and/or this dog.
   Descendants of the earliest ancestors, identified by name of different families, like Iwou,
Ayok, Mandacan, etc., spread out from the headwaters of the Wariori to the Anggi lakes,
and further north-west throughout the Arfak mountains and to the coast. The latter are
equated with the Moile, divided over a number of families, such as the Wonggor.
   These familles are referred to by the Hatam term pung, in Griffiths ( 1 994:66) glossed as
'ancestor, lineage', in the Uncen report and by my informants unsystematically rendered as
Jam, marga , keluarga, keret, which are all roughly translatable as 'family', or suku 'tribe'.
Pouwer ( 1 958 :37) gives the Hatam term poeng-e-kom (= pung-a gom 'family-CIT one'), as
                                                                        ,
meaning 'a number of (localised) kin groups with a common origin .3 He wrestled with the
vague and contradictory ways in which this term was used. It seems to me that basically his
understanding of pung was correct. The confusion arises mainly when indigenous
relationships are expressed in local Malay, when loan words such as Jam (Dutch 'famille'),
Biak keret4, or Indonesian suku 'tribe' are used to capture the various extensions of the
concept pungo The concept of pung seems to be applicable to ever-increasing concentric
circles defining an in-group, depending on who the out-group is. Thus, the smallest unit of
pung is the group of people as defined by Pouwer. A larger unit may comprise a whole
dialect or language group, when for example the Tinam are set off against the Miriei, or the
Mirei and Tinam together against the Meyah.
   Since Hatam follows an ambilineal system of descent, one can trace one's pung through
either father or mother in order to lay some claim on a piece of land. Thus, according to the
Uncen report (Tim PSL Uncen 1 9 89:8), land is owned by a group of descendants of an
ancestor who had originally claimed a piece of land by laying out his garden in an area
demarcated by some natural boundary, such as a mountain or river. Ownership of land
implies at least the right to lay out gardens, to cut wood for housing, to hunt. People
belonging to other families may walk freely through such an area, but they may not make use
of its resources. The land is inherited by male descendants, although female descendants are

    The original quote is in Dutch: ""Beide termen [given by Pouwer as Hatam ""poengekom"" and Manikion
    ""idjohoeta hom""] worden in hun gevarieerde betekenis in het plaatselijk Malies weergegeven met ""fam"" of
    zelfs ""keret""! Algemeen gesteld duiden zij een verre, al dan niet traceerbare verwantschap aan. Zij worden
    niet toegepast op leden van eigen verwantengroep, waarmee de relatie nauw en veelal traceerbaar is""
    (pouwer 1 958:38).

    Originally from Salawati jilet 'family', according to I.S. Kijne in a personal letter to F. Kamrna ( 1 6 March
    1 954).
4    Ger P. Reesinkallowed to make use of the land (Uncen 1 989:32-3 3). Occasionally, land was (and is) 'sold'
for kain timur and pigs, but this does not mean that ownership of the original family has
completely disappeared. As an example, the Uncen report refers to a Sougb man who bought
land at M inyambou, or Hatam people from Hingk who settled at Warbederi, originally
owned by the Mansim. That means that the new owner may not sell the land to a third party
without the consent of the original owners (Uncen 1 989 :34). In other words, when words like
'sell' and 'buy' are being used with respect to the land, it is mainly the use of land that is
being traded for money, kain timur or pigs. Land itself is an inalienable property, owned by
people who are linked to the original owner, through a particular narrative.
     Traditionally, an oldest brother with his immediate family occupied a large house together
with the families of younger brothers/cousins. Larger villages were hardly present, even in the
1 950s (Pouwer 1 95 8 : 1 5). Marriage was based on sister-exchange, later developed into an
indirect sister-exchange with bride price (Pouwer 1 95 8 :22, 4 1 ); see for example the text
Kain timur in the Appendix. Settlement is mainly, but not exclusively, patrilocal. To which
pung a person claims to belong, depends on where one's parents live. When a man dies, his
possessions are inherited by his wife and his children.
     The children may include adopted children (Hatam awag = Indonesian budak), who are
seen as legal children, not as slaves or servants. Both the Uncen report (p. 37) and information
I obtained from Yoas I wou5 state explicitly that the Hatam only bought children; they did not
themselves sell them. Children would be bought from the Meyah and Moskona, or from
further to the west. Compare Pans ( 1 960:47), who suggests that representatives from Hatam
and Ayamaru (i.e. Maybrat speakers) would meet each other near the Kamundam, probably
trading in kain timur as well. Two accounts from descendants of such awag I recorded at
Minyambou suggest that those children may have come from further away, obtained through
a transaction or fighting.
     For example, Erens Morum (± 45 years old) tells that the Mandacan bought his great­
grandfather (whose name he doesn't know) from the suku Marum, who lived between
Merdey and Sorong (possibly Maybrat?). He was sold for food (taros) since there was a great
famine in that area. Later his son Tamun was sold by the Mandacan to the Dowansiba people
(= Sougb) near Catubou in exchange for weapons and poison (sorcery materials). The
Dowansiba took care of him until the Second World War. Then Erens' father came to dance
at Coisi, and married a woman from the suku Hatam (as Indonesian loanwords in a Hatam
account), and so Erens and his siblings have become part of the Hatam.
     Similarly, Isak Mandacan (age ± 60 years) from Sinaitosi apparently has Moskona
ancestors. He tells about people from the headwaters of the Wariori (Ambailim), either
Hatam or Sougb, who joined those from a place called Mokngomsi to fight with the Sidai
 (Hatam for Moskona) at Mesrei. The Moskona lived on limestone rock. They shot Isak's
grandfather and captured Isak's father when he was still young (mahan bigyo 'adolescent
not-yet') and brought him to the 'village' Ambailim, at the headwaters of the Wariori.
     I will not try to give a synopsis of the names of groups (pung) given by various Hatam
 informants or those given in the World Wildlife Fund publication (Craven and De Fretes
 1 9 87) and in the Universitas Cenderawasih study (Tim PSL Uncen 1 989). Some families are
 said to make up the suku Moile, others are related to the Sougb or Meyah, other groups are
claimed to be exclusively Tinam. What has become clear so far is that there is a high degree
of intermarriage between Tinam and Sougb, so that many Tinam speakers are also fluent in
Sougb. Quite a few Hatam speakers have a Meyah mother, and can speak that language as5
    The information may not be independent, since Yoas was one of the contributing informants of the Uncen
    report.
                                                                            Introduction       5well. Pouwer ( 1 95 8 :4 1 ) concludes that mutual contacts between Hatam, Sougb and Meyah
have been far more extensive than the strong sense of in-group versus out-group would have
led one to believe. He notes that the Moile restrict their intertribal marriages mainly to the
Hatam (read: Tinam), but that there are many marriages between Hatam (= Tinam) and
Manikion (read: Sougb) or Meyah.
   The end of Yairus' story about Digomang (see Appendix) suggests that some of the Ullo
actually intermarried with people from the islands east of the Bird's Head: the Biak saw
smoke at Mibou, got in their canoes to have a look and sent one of their women to marry
UUo, even though they did not know each other's language. This may be a mythical account
of intermarriage between Hatam and people from the coast or from the islands in the
Cenderawasih Bay, which could be an explanation of the claimed mixed nature of Borai.
Compare also Pans ( 1 960:44-45) who concludes on the basis of various historical sources, as
well as oral tradition, that Hatam and Moiree people had moved to the coastal areas, where
they found the Borai and Waraan tribes. The latter groups had already mixed considerably
with islanders, like the Numfor and Biak speakers. These mixed groups further decreased in
number and distinctiveness through sickness, fighting and intermarriage with the Hatam (and
Moile) population.
   Marriage of Hatam men with women from the islands is not limited to the past. For
example, the cousins Hans and Yoas Iwou married women from Serui and Numfor
respectively.
   This sketchy data on families and intermarriages suggests that the language has had some
influences from both directions: from the Sougb-Meyah-Moskona family to the south-west,
as well as from the Biak-Numfor-Wandamen groups to the east. In the course of this study I
will point out various features that seem to be due to these influences.
   To conclude these anthropological notes, the Hatam kinship system will be presented.
Important factors in the kinship terminology of Hatam are 'age' and 'same sex'. In Ego's
own generation (Go), if Ego and sibling are of the same sex, age determines the choice of the
referring term. If Ego and sibling are of different sex, other terms, undifferentiated for age,
are used. This is also the case when sex of the linking relative is opposite to Ego's. In other
words, cross-cousins are referred to with special terms, undifferentiated for age. A special
relationship (as in so many New Guinea societies) exists between mother's brother and sister's
child.
   Terms for relations across two or three generations are reciprocal: (great-)grandparents
refer to their (great-)grandchildren according to ego's sex, but do not differentiate the sex of
their (great- )grandchildren. These terms are also used by the (great-)grandchildren, but now
disregarding their own sex. The various kinship terms will be given in two sets: the
consanguinal relations will be given for both male and female ego in Table 1 . 1 . The second
set (Table 1 .2) gives the affinal relationships. This table shows that same or different sex and
reciprocity are also important factors in the system of affinal relations. The relations in
parentheses have not been explicitly elicited. The following abbreviations are used:
G = generation; superscripts indicate Ego 's own generation (0), and ascending (+) and
descending n generations; e = elder; y = younger; B = brother; Z = sister; F = father;
M = mother; S = son; D = daughter; Ch = child; H = husband; W = wife.

October-30 November 1 994 and 8 November- I I December 1 99 5 , in M inyambou, in the
kecamatan Warmare, Kabupaten Manokwari, Bird's Head, Irian Jaya. These periods were
too short to afford extensive trekking through the area in order to obtain data on dialectal
differences. Instead, I stayed in Minyambou and collected word lists there and in adjacent
Mbenti. From a few speakers I obtained texts from the oral tradition. But I also recorded a
long personal narrative (Yoas Wonggor from Mbenti) and a sermon, given by Habel Iwou in
the church at Minyambou. These narratives in natural speech could be checked and
elaborated on with the excellent help from the principal of the primary school at M inyambou,
Hans Iwou. The dictionaries compiled by Dick Griffiths allowed me fast access to the
vocabulary of Hatam. A first result of this research was published as 'Explorations in Bert's
Head: Hatam' in Baak et al. ( 1 995).
   Having done some preliminary analysis on this material I returned to the Hatam area in
the fall of 1 995 to verify and increase my data. A few other texts were recorded, some
myths, a short historical account of events during the Second World War, and two short texts
about 'slave'-trade in the Eastern Bird's Head.
   In order to test phonological problems, a number of short sentences with contrasting items
were pronounced by three different speakers, who were prompted in Indonesian. In order to
investigate the status of verb sequences I took sentences from the recorded texts, changed
them into a negative, or a relative construction, manipulated presence or absence of certain
affixation, and asked native speakers what these sentences meant in I ndonesian, or whether
they could be used in a particular situation. The result of this method is that most examples in
this grammar are taken from natural speech, but that the discussion on relative clause and
scope of negation relies more heavily on elicited material. As much as possible, especially
where deemed significant to stress natural language use, I have indicated in brackets from
which recorded text an example is taken. The text references include texts which have not
been included in this volume.
   Throughout this volume I attempt to follow, as much as possible, the established
orthography as employed in the published Hatam material, such as the New Testament. The
most obvious discrepancy concerns the spelling of the negative. I n the established
orthography this is bi 'not', but since I believe the word resembles items spelled with final -ig
(for example, often a noticeable friction following the high vowel-see §2.3 for further
details), I have chosen for the spelling big.
   In spite of the additional information obtained during my second visit to Minyambou,
many questions remain. In particular, the extent of the phonemic status of geminate
consonants cannot be unequivocally stated. Likewise, the status of various elements described
in the morphology and syntax is rather dubious. This is no surprise, of course, considering
that my analysis is based on fieldwork of only eleven weeks. In a sense, it could be
considered to be rather presumptuous to attempt to write a grammar on the basis of such a
short exposure to a language. While I was in the process of revising an earlier version of this
grammar, an even more presumptuous account of the language was published.
   Based on a short trip, Donohue ( 1 997) published a Hatam phonology and grammatical
notes. He does not recognise high vowels in the language, nor any contrast between single and
geminate consonants. He also posits a series of labio-velar consonants, for which there is no
evidence. His ykpe 'house' refers to a compound ig-bei 'house-under'. There are quite a few
data in his paper which show the typical misunderstandings a first survey invariably contains.
For example, he identifies the nasal in nggwen 'sick' and kney 'bad' as the same element,
8    Ger P. Reesinksignalling a strong denial. In fact, there are no other items that relate in the same way as kei
'good' and kanei 'bad' , which suggests that the formal similarity is just accidental. The word
for 'sick', nggwen, is one of many that begin with a homorganic nasal, but gwen does not
exist, as far as I know. So far, a semantic constant between lexical items that differ only in
the presence or absence of an initial homorganic nasal could not be established. To be fair, it
may be that his data are from a different dialect, spoken near the Anggi lakes, which may
have a Beneficiary marker yp, or a coreferential subject marking prefix ho. In the Tinam
dialect, I have not found anything that suggests a particular morphology to indicate
something like a switch-reference mechanism. This is not the place to make an evaluation of
every item in Donohue's paper. The value of a description depends to a degree on the time
one has been exposed to a language. In other words, the present work too may contain a
number of misunderstandings and wrong analyses, which may show up after a more thorough
acquaintance with the language.
   This monograph does not pretend to give more than a preliminary description of Hatam
and I have refrained from extensive discussions of a theoretical nature. This applies in
particular to the phonology, which at first glance appeared to be quite simple, but does
contain a number of problematic issues related to the stress pattern. In the area of syntax , a
theoretical discussion regarding serial verb constructions is avoided. I have simply tried to
arrange my data in such a way that some arguments bearing on that topic can find some
corroboration. Following the chapters on phonology and grammar, I present a few texts, with
annotations.
2 Phonology
2.0 Introduction   Hatam is a language with a strikingly rhythmic pattern, roughly alternating unstressed and
stressed syllables. This will be illustrated and discussed in the final section of this chapter. A
number of problems with regard to the phonological segments are tied up with this pattern.
The contrasts for the consonants and vowels that I consider to be phonemic, as represented in
Tables 2. 1 and 2.2, are limited to monosyllabic words. They will be given in §2. 1 . Although
Griffith's dictionary ( 1 994) lists words with geminates for both voiced and voiceless bilabial
and velar stops, voiced palatal stop and the lateral, I have not found decisive evidence for all
of these. Hence, I have given the suspicious elements in parentheses. The status of geminates
will be discussed in §2.2.
   In word-final position, the distinction in voicing of consonants is neutralised. This will be
shown in §2. 3 . In phonemic transcriptions, therefore, I use the convention of symbolising
archiphonemes in capitals. In §2.4 I discuss the phonemic status of the palatal series, which
has a more restricted distribution than stops and nasals of other points of articulation.
Whereas the discussion in §2. 1 -§2.4 is limited to monosyllabic words, the following topics
concern polysyllabic items. In §2 .5 the preconsonantal nasals will be presented, and in §2.6
the unspecified vowel in unaccented syllables. The vocoid sequences in §2.7 provide further
evidence for the consonantal approximants and phonetic realisation of the unspecified vowel.
In §2.8 the possible consonant clusters are illustrated. The facts from §2.2-§2 . 8 will be
summarised in a discussion of the syllable structure (§2.9), which will then allow us to
appreciate the iambic stress pattern that Hatam utterances display, to be discussed in §2. 1 O.
   Occasionally, I refer to words in the orthography which is used in Griffiths ( 1 994) and
other published Hatam materials. In those cases the Hatam items are given in italics. In the
orthography both rand l occur, even though there is no phonemic contrast. Word-finally, the
orthography appears to distinguish between voiced and voiceless consonants, such as g and k,
even though voicing is neutralised. The unaccented vowel (§2.6) is orthographically
represented as i, and the (alleged) geminates by double consonants, such as tt, and so on.","[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"
"   In other words, the preferred interpretation of the scope of negation is the whole clause or
the expansion: they may hold the children or not, but at least they are not coming towards the
deictic centre. The second interpretation, namely that negation applies only to the first
predicate and does not involve the direction, is definitely available, as (4. 1 4Sb) shows.",[125]

129
      In this line the speaker wants to say that he doesn't know exactly the time kain timur entered the Hatam
      area. He pauses and repairs quite a few times. He finally decides to say that the cloths reached the area
      through (the compound tug han is explained as melalui 'through the means, according to') the East
      Indonesians. They were the ones who made them.
130
      I take it that the subject of this clause refers to the people of Timur 'the East' who sold their cloths off to
      others, such as the Hatam. The verb tri is used for 'selling' or 'delivering' a speech, while the antonym is
      expressed by pek 'buy', 'acquire', 'reach'. Thus, the prepositional object i-tri leu )!Q!1i has the same referent
      as the subject, see rules for reflexivity, §3. 1 .
131
      As Hatam equivalents for this Indonesian term, the speaker suggested -yai-kep-ti 'takeJdo-keep.onto-NOM'
      or ninsinati 'method, way of doing things' (presumably, this is polymorphemic as well, but not as
      transparent as the former term).
132
      This phrase is phonetically realised as (nyentandikpoinya). There are more speakers who pronounce first
      plural possessive with a prenasalised alveolar stop which may be voiced or voiceless, but not aspirated: [nye­
      nde) or [nye-nte).

"4. 7.2. 1 Counterexpectation 10   The qualification of 'counterexpectation' is given to the conjunction lo, because in

    It is quite likely that lo is in fact related to the nominal marker ri 'Given' with the
additional vowel 0 , which is used on inclusive disjunctions, glossed as 'or'. Phonologically, lo
cliticises to the preceding verb, just as ri forms a phonological unit with its preceding nominal
constituent. Its position and function are reminiscent of deictic elements in Papuan languages
of the TNGP, which are all SOV?9

   As we have seen, antithetical lo , in combination with the negative big and the sequential
lene, expresses a time-span: 'after a while' (lit. but not then), as in:
     (4.2 1 8)     Lene      nggok,    nggok      lo      big    lene     ngat kwa

4. 7.2.2 Antithetical noro   An antithetical relation between two clauses is expressed by noro, quite straightforwardly
translatable by 'but', as in examples (4.2 1 9) and (4.220).

     Even though the languages have a completely different morphological and synyactic structure (Usan being

4. 7.3 Adverbial conjunctions   The conjunctions to be discussed in this section are basically prepositions or they are built
on nominal markers. The clauses introduced by these conjunctions can be analyzed as
substitutes for nominal constituents. Hence, I characterise them as adverbial conjunctions.
They signal explicit cause or reason, purposive, conditional and temporal relations.","[142, 143, 144]"
"In other words, an 'instrument-sequence' necessarily has identical subjects. V I may be any

     kwen is a repair of the first instance of kwen, specifying the manner of cooking. The pause following this
     clause suggests that binggas dima may be a preposed object of the final predicate ni-yem 'we ate'.

    If the instrument has not been introduced in a verbal clause, as was the case in examples
(4. 1 1 3) and (4. 1 1 4), but when it is given as a single N(P), linked to the main clause by ba
'and' or lene 'then', the main verb is obligatorily marked with an instrument affix:
     (4. 1 1 5)    Pinda hou        gom lene di-bi-non             hacam-o . . .

                   (I had) one shotgun and with that I shot hawks and so on ... [Wonggor 1 :030]The Instrument prefix is liable to 'excessive use' by some speakers. That is, even when no
instrument has been mentioned in the preceding context, main verbs may be prefixed with bi­
to signal that an instrument is understood, as in:     (4. 1 1 6)    Noni      0-bi-bon     hagom                   bi-put              tu

                    [Habel 1 :006]
4.5.3 Purposive verb sequences   In contrast to Directional and Instrumental constructions, Purposives can be characterised
as Different Subject sequences. In many instances the sequence labeled 'purposive' can also
be interpreted as 'resultative', especially when the utterance refers to a past event, as in
example (4. 1 1 7). Later we will see that negation may sometimes favour a resultative
interpretation, and at other times a purposive one. In many cases the subject of the purposive
or resultative verb is the object of the first verb. Whether the result is expressed by a verb, as
in (4. 1 1 7), or an adjective, as in (4. 1 1 8), in both cases it needs to be marked with the
purposive clitic.'5 The (b) variants are unacceptable.
     (4. 1 1 7) (a) Di-bui      napia      bi-mai.
                    I SG-hit wild.pig PUR-die
                    I killed the wild pig. (lit. I hit the wild pig dead.)
14   Note that no '3SG' is part of the bimorphemic conjunction api-no, which conveys a slightly stronger sense
     of (con-)sequence than api. Recall that third person singular has a zero subject prefix, hence the various
     verbs in (4. 1 1 4) are all uninflected. Perhaps better: only bi-yai is uninflected, while the other verbs are
     covertly inflected as revealed by another person category:           Di-su          di-ndab      bi-yai
           I SG-stretch   I SG-hand    INS-take

          I stretched my hand and with it I got a ripe sweet potato and gave it to them.
15   This clitic may be a weakened form of the preposition bak 'to, for', as suggested in §3.2.6. There are also
     sentences where it seems to be interchangeable with the connective ba 'and'. To add another conjecture,
     these two may well be related historically, if the elision of the final consonant is comparable to that of the
     pronominal forms nok and yok to no and yo.

    In the orthography 'angry' is given as gga. But in my recordings the consonant is always voiceless and
    slightly aspirated.
16        Ger P. Reesink2.3 Final stops   Word-finally, the palatal stops do not occur. For the other stops the voiced-voiceless
contrast is neutralised. I will give evidence for stops of three places of articulation:
(i)       Regarding bilabial stops, in one sentence one may find: [m�mbron� mem sop>]
          'brideprice for woman', immediately followed by [atau ibuwak> soph] 'or they marry
          women'. Nouns in citation form are always 'suffixed' with the vowel -a, whether they
          end in vowel or consonant. In that context, no noun 'ends' with a voiceless stop, which
          gives [sob-a] 'woman' as citation form. Thus IsoPI 'woman' is realised with (a) an
          unreleased voiceless bilabial stop or (b) a released voiceless one preceding a pause, or
          (c) a voiced bilabial stop preceding a vowel.(ii)      As for alveolar stops, the verb IngaTI 'to see' is realised as [I)at] utterance-finally in:
       (2.2)       [a-yay      b�-dani mEm d�-I)ath]
                   2SG-give to-me           for     l SG-see
                   Let me see it. (lit. Give it to me so I can see it.)Alternatively, it is [I) ad] preceding a vowel, as in the more polite request, using the
interrogative particle -i:       (2.3)       [a-yay    �-dani mEm d�-I)ad-i]
                   2SG-give to-me        for     l SG-see-Q
                   Would you give it to me so I can see it, please.(iii)     Similarly, in the case of velar stops: l-ngwaKI 'forehead' is realised as [I)wak> -
          I)wakh], with [-I)waga] as citation form. This word does not contrast with Ingwakl
          'empty' in final position. Three speakers realised the following test sentences:       (2.4)       yoni i-kwei       ngat lo       ig    ngwak.
                   they 3PL-come see         but house empty

                  With the mitibam leaves he tied the spear to the roof. [Kwanding 094]Since the expression of an instrument involves a combination of predicates, the role of an
instrument will be further discussed in §4.5.2.
   The general clause formula gives the most common word order. However, other word
orders are possible. Hatam does allow (oblique) objects to be preposed, or time adverbials in
clause-final position. Adverbs are possible at various positions throughout the clause, except
between verb and direct object. These options will be shown when I discuss each clause
constituent in §4.4. But first the general structure of the noun phrase, with comments on its
constituents, will be presented in §4. 1 . Section 4.2 will illustrate non-verbal predications,
which are not covered by the general clause formula. Another construction that does not
correspond to the verbal clause involves impersonal predicates. This will be presented in §4.3.
A rather striking feature of Hatam is its prolific use of asyndetic verb sequences. Since this
phenomenon is pertinent to the issue of serial verb constructions, I will discuss various
combinations of predications and the scope of negation which they allow in some detail in
§4.5. Relative clauses with their possible head nouns are dealt with in §4.6. This chapter will
close with a presentation of clause combinations in §4 .7, according to the conjunctions as
given in §3 . 1 5 .",[95]

   It should be clear from this short description that a number of questions remain. For
example, what exactly are the factors that determine differences such as between (2.73) and
(2.74)? Other topics which need further research are the geminates. At least for the bilabial
                                                                            Phonology       39and alveolar nasals and for voiceless stops of three points of articulation enough evidence for
geminates has been given. Possibly there are also geminates for the palatal stop and the
liquid. Whether geminates contrast in voice, as the orthography suggests, remains a question.
   Regarding the voiced-voiceless opposition, my tentative conclusion is that this holds only
for the onset of stressed syllables.
   Possibly a basic template for the prosodic form of lexical items in Hatam could account
for syllabic nasals, vowel or consonant status of VV(V) sequences, and occurrence
restrictions of geminates and certain vowels. But that would require a more theoretical
treatment than I considered desirable for this descriptive study.
   I hope to have at least indicated that Hatam is characterised by a clear iambic metre which
has full clauses or utterances as its domain, and not some kind of limited word stress.
3 Morphology
3.0 Introduction   This chapter gives the word classes that appear necessary for a description of Hatam. This
language, like the languages that are claimed to constitute the West-Papuan Phylum, has a
rather limited morphology. Inalienable nouns and verbs are prefixed to index person-number
of possessor and subject. To facilitate the treatment of nouns and verbs, I will first discuss
the personal pronouns. There are a number of clitics which apply either to lexical items or to
clausal constituents. These will be presented before the other word classes are discussed. The
way some of the clitics operate on different word classes can then be described in the
appropriate sections. This chapter then, will provide all the 'building blocks' which are
needed to account for the syntactic structures to be discussed in Chapter 4. In general I will
use the established orthography. At times, when necessary, phonetic realisations will be
specified.","[54, 55, 56]"

76   The occurrence of the nominaliser gi before kui is strange here. It could be that a velar stop of kikau(g)
     surfaces, connected with a schwa to the following verb mbut.
77   The free translation is motivated by the following observations: (i) ni-kan-kan was first explained as kami
     tidak tahu 'we don't know', but no negative element is present; (ii) ni-nyai-si, which contains the word nyai
     'other bank of a river' was explained as akhir bumi, tunjung bumi 'end (of) world, cape (of) world'. Clearly,
     the narrator means something like: 'we don't know exactly where this mythical hero went, but it must have
     been way beyond our familiar world'.

sense of assertion conveyed by ri, as illustrated by (3 . 1 39)-(3 . 1 40). It is as if a speaker wants

4.4. 4 Beneficiary/recipient       =   bak-constituent   The NP or pronoun that is governed by the preposition bak 'to(wards)' can be
characterised as beneficiary or recipient of the action expressed by the predicate. The
preposition phrase always follows the object (if present). Consider the two instances of this
sequence, one in the main clause, one in the relative clause, in the following sentence:
   (4.57)      Ninei       gi           kwes    yai      nisindem

               sick. [Habel 1 :027]
    The generic verb yai 'get/do' means 'give' when combined with bak. This same preposition
co-occurs with verbs like ndo 'point' = 'show to'; pa i 'say' = 'say to', and others. The
preposition bak may be phonetically weakened to the clitic bi-, which is phonetically realised

                        Inspection of that list after I have collected data on Hatam myself suggests that Loukotka's source was from
Reesink, G.P. A Grammar of Hatam, Irian Jaya, Indonesia.
                        a dialect other than the main one, Tinam. I have not been able to find a date for Loukotka's publication.

2    Ger P. Reesink1.2 Hatam and its linguistic neighbours    Hatam is spoken by approximately 1 6,000 people living in the Arfak mountains, south of
Manokwari in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. According to Griffiths ( 1 994
and pers.comm.), the language comprises five dialects: Tinam, Miriei (or Moille, as in
Craven and De Fretes 1 98 7 ; Moile in Tim PSL Uncen 1 989), Adihup, Uran and Moi? Hans
Iwou (principal of the Primary School at Minyambou) claimed that Tinam and Adihup are
virtually the same, Moille and Uran (y.Iaran) are similar to each other, but clearly distinct
from Tinam, and Moi (also known as Mansim in Indonesian) is quite different. The latter
language variety, also called Moi Brai, was characterised as a mixture of Hatam and Biak,
spoken by a small group of people. Moi Brai turned out to be equivalent to Borai, apparently
a transcription of Brai with an epenthetic vowel. This language is still known by a few people
near the coast. It does seem to be related to Hatam, with some Biak-Numfor features as well.
See Reesink (forthcoming b). In Borai or Moi Brai one refers to the language by mor moi,
while mor pin is 'bahasa Nufor' = the 'Nufor language' and mor brer refers to 'Indonesian'.
In Hatam on the other hand, ni-hyet mor '3SG-voice mor' refers to 'Indonesian'. Apparently
the term mor, which meant 'language' to the Moi Brai, had the connotation 'foreign' to the
other Hatam groups, such as Miriei and Tinam.
    The origin of the name Hatam is not clear. Pouwer (1 958:40) suggests that the word has a
Numfor origin: atam 'thatch of pandanus leaves'. Possibly it is an outsider's interpretation of
ni-hyet tinam '3SG-speech tinam' as a native speaker of Tinam would refer to hislher
language. Tinam is the major dialect, in which the New Testament has been published (by
Lembaga Alkitab Indonesia in 1 99 3). It is easily understood and spoken by speakers of the
other dialects. A systematic dialect study has not been done, but it seems that the major
difference between Miriei and Tinam is a regular correspondence between lsi and /hI, as in
M iriei sab and Hatam hab for 'bird', sum and hum 'fire', and so on. It is the Tinam dialect
that is the object of this study. I have no further information on variation between the other
Hatam dialects. Neighbouring language groups are Sougb and Meyah. The Sougb are called
Tuig in Hatam, and the Meyah are called Sreu.
    Typologically, Sougb, Meyah and Hatam appear to be very similar to each other and to
other languages of the so-called West Papuan Phylum: SVO word order, verbal morphology
limited to subject prefixation, Noun-Adjective-Determiner in the NP, Genitive-Noun order in
possessive constructions, and the use of prepositions (see also Reesink 1 996). Lexically the
languages have very little in common, although a few items suggest a remote genetic
 relationship between Hatam and the East-Bird's Head family, which comprises Sougb and
the closely related languages Meyah and Moskona. See Reesink ( 1 998).
    All languages of the (eastern) Bird's Head have at least a few words of Austronesian
origin, presumably from Biak-Numfor, such as pas 'rice', sansun 'clothes' and wonggor
 'crocodile' . Hatam has borrowed extensively. How old those loans are is hard to say at the
 moment. Items such as pikor 'school', las 'day', pinak 'send' are probably quite recent, but
 others, such as mai 'loincloth' (Numfor mar) and hup 'highlands' (Numfor sup) could be
quite old. See Reesink ( 1 99 8). An assessment of the relationship between Hatam and Biak­
Numfor would need more information on what seems to be the 'missing link ', the nearly
 extinct language Borai.","[17, 18]"

     Emotions are expressed in Hatam by phrases of the inalienable noun -ngon 'heart 6 plus an
adjective, a verb, or an element that appears not to function separately anymore in the
language. Just a few examples are given in (3.70). For an extensive list, see Griffiths
( 1 994:49-52).

    The order Genitive-Noun was already used by Van der Veen ( 1 905:95) as a diagnostic feature of Non­
    Austronesian languages of North-Halmahera. See also Reesink ( 1 996) for a comparison of the Bird's Head
    languages in general with adjacent Austronesian languages.
82 . Ger P. Reesink4.1.2 Adjectives   Adjectives always follow the noun in an NP, when they function as attributives. As shown
in §3 .5, they contrast with verbs in this respect. In attributive position adjectives may occur in
three different shapes: (i) as a bare adjective (example 4. 1 5); (ii) with the relativiser di- (see
§3.2.5) as in (4. 1 6); and (iii) with the 3 SG.POS prefix ni-, as in (4. 1 7). The difference
between the morphological shapes of the attributive adjective is reflected in the free
translations.
   (4. 1 5)       wou     cun    di-ma
                  snake short REL-that
                  that short snake   (4. 1 6)       wou di-cun           di-ma
                  snake REL-short REL-that
                  that snake which is short   (4. 1 7)       wou ni-cun            di-ma
                  snake 3SG-short REL-that
                  that short one of a snake
    In other words, the relative marker /dV-/ is employed to single out one individual from a
set of possible referents by a particular feature, expressed by the adjective. When the
adjective is marked with the third person singular prefix , it seems to indicate a more
permanent quality. The expression in (4. 1 7) would then refer to a snake that is inherently
short. Whether this is the correct interpretation is not clear. Thus, with respect to (4. 1 8a) and
(4. 1 8b) informants would say that (a) refers to a knife that is curved, while the (b) variant
would refer to a sickle which is bent even more. This could mean a temporary state, or a
permanent one of such a bent sickle. In other words, more data would be needed to ascertain
whether the semantic effect of 3SG.POS prefix is indeed a permanent quality. I have no
evidence to answer the question whether plural prefixes are possible in this construction.
   (4. 1 8) (a)   Singau koi        di-ni       ngwam.
                  knife    curved REL-this blunt
                  This curved knife (= sickle) is blunt.              (b) Singau ni-koi          di-ma        ngwam.
                  knife   3SG-curved REL-that         blunt

"When the question word is fronted, the question will maintain its final marker:   (3. 1 5 3)    Tut     mindei a-pim       l' .7

                 What are you crying about?
  The Q-word tou is the basis for questions after 'who', 'how', 'where' and 'which'.
Questions about human identity use tou 'who', which in subject position seems t o require the
Given particle ri, as in example (3. 1 54).
   (3 . 1 54)    Tou   n      no     ngot ig           di-ni         i?

                 For whom are you cooking rice?
70       Ger P. Reesink  To ask information about a particular referent out of a possible set of inanimate entities,
Hatam uses the same form tou:
     (3 . 1 56)      Nan a-de           ig    n tou-i?
                     you   2SG-POS house GIV which-Q
                     Which one is your house?
     The identity of inanimate referents is questioned with mindei:
     (3 . 1 57)      Nani a-bon        mindei-i?
                     you   2SG-make what-Q
                     What are you making?
     LOCATION (or direction) is questioned by hantou (= han 'place' + tou 'which'):
     (3 . 1 58)      Yoni i-kos      nab      ei     han-tou     i?
                     they 3PL-cut pig         LOC    place-which Q
                     Where do they cut the pig?
     If hantou is fronted, the Q-marker i remains utterance-final:
     (3 . 1 59)      Ei    han-tou        a-ttei      biei mui ug           i?

                     To where do you take the firewood?
   MANNER is questioned using tou with third person singular no preceding. It may be
positioned in either initial or final position in the clause:
     (3 . 1 60) (a) No    tou    yoni i-kim  riep i?
                    3 SG how they 3PL-tie trap Q
                    How do they make a trap?                  (b) Noni bon     ngug no      tou i?
                      he    make fence 3SG how Q
                      How does he make a fence?
   TIME and QUANTITY both use the Q-word pig. The temporal question word,
phonetically realised as [<I>i] , is followed by the conjunction api 'then' and seems to be
restricted to initial position, as in example (3 . 1 6 1 ). When quantity is questioned, the final
position is required (3 . 1 62), with the question marker immediately following, phonetically
linked by a palatal fricative [<I>icyi].
                                                                              .

       This sentence doesn't make it very clear whether it is the women or Hambong who do the cutting. The
       felling of the trees is done by Hambong's younger brother (recall that -kinjoi means 'younger sibling of same
       sex '), called Mipong, which is also the name of a cuscus species. Presumably, the enclitic nya indicates that
       Mipong was one of a group who did it.

       The compound -ya kep means 'to be occupied with something for quite some time, with considerable effort'.
       Hatam has two words that are translated as 'finished': ngwig means 'depleted' (Indonesian habis) and put
       means 'completed' (Indonesian selesai). Ngwig is used to express the notion that 'there were no gardens left
       to do'.

14   In Griffith's dictionary nyen is glossed as 'repeatedly'. I have the impression it conveys something like
     'without purpose', like nating in Tok Pisin: 01 i wokabaut nating 'they are just walking around'. It seems to
     be present in hanyen 'anew' which co-occurs with bu 'again' in: noni kwei hanyen bu 'he come anew again'
     = 'he came/comes/will come again'.
4 Syntax4.0 Introduction   Hatam is a rather strict SVO language, with time adverbials normally preceding the
subject. A subject NP (where NP includes pronouns) is often not required, since the verbal
predicate is obligatorily marked for person/number of the subject. Oblique objects, such as
locative or directional adverbials, benefactive or purposive constituents, are expressed as
preposition phrases, following the direct object. However, in natural speech I have not found
instances of all the constituents within one clause. Thus, a general formula for the clause in
Hatam is:
             ± TimelModal ± S + Predicate ± 0 ± BEN ± LOCas in:   (4. 1 )     Mmo       di-cig      (lj-yai ni-de   hamboi arm
               perhaps   l SG-father 3SG-get 3SG-POS machete adorned

               to  you
               Maybe my father will give his adorned machete to you.
   The predicate is the only obligatory constituent of the clause, with the proviso that in
isolation transitive verbs have to be accompanied by an object. Thus, minimal predications
are as in examples (4.2}-(4.4).
   (4.2)       A -kwei.

                was on the south-west of the Bird's Head peninsula of Irian Jaya. At the same time, we
                realised that a detailed study of languages spoken in the eastern part of the Bird's Head was
                necessary if we wanted to obtain a more complete picture of the so-called West-Papuan
                phylum and other language groups in this area. One intriguing target was what was known as
                a phylum-level isolate in the eastern part of the Bird's Head: Hatam.
                   Not much was known. We knew that missionaries of TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance
                Mission) were working on a bible translation in that language, but no linguistic description
                was available. The oldest information on the language was a (very) short article by Loukotka,
                which contains a few words of the language. ' Cowan ( 1 953) does not contain any Hatam
                material. He presents some data on what he calls Mansibaber, which can be identified as
                Meyah or related Moskona, and Manikion (equated with Mantion), which can be identified
                as Sougb.
                   In Voorhoeve (1 975) and Wurm and Hattori ( 1 98 1 ) Hatam and Borai are treated as
                related languages, clearly separate from neighbouring language groups. In later publications,
                Borai has disappeared and Hatam is listed as an isolate (Voorhoeve ( 1 987a, 1 987b), Silzer
                and Heikkinen ( 1 99 1 )). In fact, Voorhoeve ( 1 9 8 7b:9 1 ) substitutes the name Tinam for
                Hatam and Silzer and Heikkinen ( 1 9 9 1 : 50) include Borai together with a number of other
                names as alternatives for Hatam.
                   Similarly, not much was known about Manikion or Mantion, Meyah or Moskona. As the
                ISIR program started in 1 99 3 we learned that members of the Summer Institute of
                Linguistics were active in Meyah (and Moskona), and that Manikion was in fact a derogatory
                term for people who call themselves Sougb. In Sougb also, TEAM missionaries were
                involved in bible translation, but no linguistic description was available.
                   Our plan, then, was to try to increase our knowledge of these languages, either through our
                own fieldwork or through material from SIL linguists. The main question was: What kind of
                language is Hatam? Related questions were: What is the status of Borai? Does it exist as a
                separate language? Is it possible to get some more information on Sougb?
                   The answer to the first question is found in this monograph, with some preliminary
                information on the related questions provided in this introduction (see § 1 .2).","[14, 15, 16, 17]"

"This requirement also holds for ngwig 'finished' (= depleted) and put 'finished ' (=
completed), which cannot easily be included in either word class.
    Since third person singular verbs are unmarked, it is not always clear whether the
homophonous form bi- is an Instrumental prefix or a Purposive pro-clitic. In the following
(elicited) sentences, which both appear more resultative, the contrast between PURPOSIVE
and INSTRUMENT bi- is shown explicitly with alternating person categories:
   (4. 1 1 9)      Nyeni    ni-ba          mlClm   ni-bi-dat.

"4.5. 6. 4 Negation and instrumental sequences   Negation of a sequence involving an Instrument, as in example (4. 1 46a), has as its first
reading that the scope is restricted to the Instrument. Thus, (b) is the most likely continuation:
     (4. 1 46) (a) Di-ba      hamboi di-bi-wim             biei          big,

18   Informants rejected ei igbei su for (4. 1 44c), in contrast to what I would have expected on the basis of the
     general morpho-phonological rule for tu/su. Perhaps some similar distinction as was described for silti in
     §4.4.6 is at play here.

give an idea of the elusive meaning it has in the functional domain of 'asserted givenness'.",[83]

     This is the only instance I have, in elicited material. Why tu had been accepted rather than corrected to su is
     not clear.

     Since third person singular lacks a subject prefix, the various tests and their interpretations are vacuous.
     Examples from the natural texts involving third person singular need to be confirmed for other person
     categories.
98       Ger P. Reesink   Such sequences are all necessarily same-subject, in contrast with similar sequences
interrupted by ba 'and' or lene 'then' (see §4.7. 1 ), which may have either same or different
subjects. When explicit conjunctions are employed it is clear that the sequence involves
coordination of clauses. The same observation holds for sequences interrupted by a pause, as
in example (4.97). But the question is, what is the status of sequences without connectives?
Are they asyndetically coordinated clauses? Does Hatam require an analysis positing a
special class of serial verb constructions? What happens to verbal prefixation in close verbal
sequences? What syntactic restrictions are placed on various sequences? In this preliminary
descriptive work I refrain from theoretical commitments with regard to the issue of serial
verb constructions. I have tried to gather data that seems to be relevant to the matter, and will
present that without too much interpretation.
   In order to at least partly answer these questions I will discuss morphological and syntactic
features of the following categories: (i) Directional verb sequences, (ii) Instrumental verb
sequences, (iii) Purposive verb sequences, (iv) Perception verbs + complements, and (v)
General juxtaposition. These sections are then followed by a discussion of the scope of
negation.","[113, 114]"
"
4.5. 6.3 Negation and directional sequences (ii)  This category is formed by structures in which a prefixed main verb is followed by an
unprefixed directional verb as V2:
     (4. 1 4S) (a) Yoni i-krau        munggwom kwei              big.
                   they 3PL-hold child                  come     not
                   They don't bring the child(ren). (lit. They don't hold the child(ren) hither.)Sentence (4. 1 4Sa) has as its first reading simply: 'They don't holdlkeep the children, so the
children stay where they are', but it can be felicitously followed by either (b) or (c):              (b) Noro i-krau        munggwom         ug.
                  but    3PL-hold child               go
                  Take the children away. (lit. But they hold the children thither.)              (c) Munggwom pima          yo-nti    i-kwei.

                  The children come of their own accord.",[125]
"In examples (4.7 3a) and (4.7 3b) the nominaliser has to be si; ti is unacceptable, but when the
phonological condition for si is removed, ti is required, as in (4.7 3c).
                                                                                    Syntax   93            (c) presiden ni-kwei        hanyen-ti
                president 3SG-come again-NOM
                the coming again of the presidentAlthough these nominalisations correlate with the possible constructions already given in
§ 3 . 2 . 3 , this analysis does not seem to account for the facts presented in examples
(4 .68}-(4 .70). Perhaps, the areal nominaliser is able to operate on different levels: word,
phrase, or clause. My data are not sufficient to give an adequate explanation in terms of such
a solution.
   Locative phrases apparently can be preposed, just as direct objects. They are outside the
clause proper, as indicated by the presence of the topic marker, as in example (4.74), or
intonational means such as rising intonation and pause in (4.69).
   (4.74)      Ei   hanjop         nsi    pima            ne      i-sra biei. . .

               In that area then, they cut wood. . . [Srat atoran:009]
4. 4. 7 Comitative   The comitative relation is expressed by the preposition kin 'with', which expresses
coordination within an NP, between either animate or inanimate nouns, as in examples (4.75)
and (4.76) respectively. In (4.76) the extension of the direct object is actually in an
afterthought position, following the final (falling) intonation on bak dani:
   (4.75)      Lene dani kin di-sut-bat-nya [ ...]      ni-huk    hab.
               then I        with l SG-friend-COLL-PL l EXC-chase bird
               Then I with my friends, we hunted birds.","[108, 109]"
"
4. 6.5 RC with HN as possessor    When a possessor is relativised, the N(P) referring to the possessor is fronted and the RC
is introduced by die-no). The possessive pronoun (4 . 1 87) or, in the case of inalienables, the
prefix (4. 1 88), remains in the normal position in the clause.
   (4. 1 87)    Tungwatu     di   hum        0-yem   i-de           ig
                people       [REL fire       3SG-eat 3PL-POS        house]RC               pima i-bong       bit   da ei        dit-de     ig-bei.

               The people whose house was burned slept with me in my house.
   In general, the word order in the RC is basically the same as in a main declarative clause.
The main participants obey the order Subject-Predicate-Direct Object-Oblique Object.
Whichever constituent is relativised on is fronted and the RC is introduced by a relativiser.
Temporal adverbials, which in a main declarative clause normally precede the clause nucleus,
are not permitted in their canonical position in a RC. Thus, (4. 1 88b) is unacceptable.
   (4. 1 88) (a) Pinai    di      ni-t-nem           mai           annani
                 man      [REL    3SG-POS-wife       3SG-die       yesterdaY]RC               dip-mang       rio

               man         REL    3SG-wife     yesterday    die     that
4.7 Clause combinations4. 7. 0 Introduction   In §4 .S , I discussed combinations of predicates. Most of those constructions can be
considered to form complex predicates or clauses. No natural discourse can do without
combining clauses, which generally is effected by conjunctions. Traditionally, the dichotomy
of coordination versus subordination is used, but it is not always clear which criteria are
1 20      Ger P. Reesinkdistinctive. The morphological material used to express various semantic relations between
clauses indicates that this is not a clear dichotomy in Hatam. This section is built on the
conjunctive material of Hatam itself (see §3 . 1 5), which suggests a division between
i) conjunctions used for sequencing events, ii) contrastive conjunctions and iii) conjunctions
which signal more specific semantic relations, such as cause, purpose, condition. The first
two categories roughly correspond to what traditionally is called coordination, while the third
reminds us of adverbial clauses, which are more subordinated.
                                                                                 ,
With regard to the conjunctions ba 'and', lene 'and then', and api 'thereupon 25, one could
claim an increasing scale of sequentiality. Since speakers are not bound by absolute values on
such a scale, there are contexts in which these conjunctions are interchangeable. As an
introductory illustration, consider all three of them in (1 89).     (4. 1 89) (a) Lene ni-huk         kikau          lene
                   then  l EXC-chase continually      then
                   Then we continued hunting and then              (b) di-sut       gam bu            pilei     bu.
                  I SG-friend one      again     shoot     again
                  a friend of mine shot again (i.e. the narrator had had his first shot).              (c) Nora mai        big-yo lene     ni-huk         kikau.
                  but      die    not-yet then     l EXC-chase continually
                  But it (the deer) was not dead yet and we continued hunting.              (d) Api    di-sut       gam bu          pilei bu,
                  then   I SG-friend one      again   shoot again
                  And then another friend shot again,              (e) ba    ni-bou        ningai ni-pilei           ug     e             api      maio
                  and l EXC-head three          l EXC-shoot go         Q             then     die
                  and the three of us had shot first and then it died.              (f) Mai lene ni-bam              rusa pima ba           ni-digo.
                  die     then 1 EXC-roast deer that         and      1 EXC-cut.up
                  It died and then we roasted the deer and we cut it up. [W onggor 1 :040-04 1 ]
   The more neutral ba, which is mainly used for same subject (or topic) sequences (4 . 1 89f),
conveys something like 'in addition (I want to say)' in (4 . 1 8ge) and signals an immediate
sequence of events (see §4.7 . 1 . 1 ).
   The most frequent conjunction to start a new sentence is lene (4. 1 89a), which is neutral to
the distinction between same and different subject . Thus, it is not claimed that Hatam
employs a switch-reference system as do many Papuan languages of the Trans-New Guinea
phylum. In combination with other words lene is used to express concepts such as 'after' and
'before'.
   Api signals a greater temporal distance between events, as in (4. 1 89d) and (4. 1 8ge). It
may cooccur with either ba or lene.","[135, 136]"
"An interesting case of alternative realisation of stress on content words is provided by two
speakers who produced the test sentence (2.65), which was meant to ascertain the tense
consonant of the word for 'cracked' (Indonesian retak).",[50]
"In other words, (3 . 1 39) could be glossed as 'The iron-tipped arrows, they are for shooting
pigs'. In some cases it follows a (relative) clause (3. 1 40) or single adjectives (3. 1 4 1 ), having
the same import as, for example, 'it is' in English cleft sentences.",[83]
"24   Actually, when eliciting possible RC constructions, an alternative for (4. 1 77) and (4. 1 78) was given as:          Dani     di-kos      mikwau pima       di-ba        singau di         ngwam bibor.
          I         l SG-cut meat      that      l SG-use     knife    REL      blunt   very
          But this seems to mean 'Given that I cut the meat, I used a knife that was very blunt' and is not a
          predication about singau.
1 18    Ger P. Reesink   (4. 1 80) (a) Sop        die-no)    di-tri    srat         mbum

    If a Direct Object is not expressed, but an 'adverbial' verb series is involved (see example
(4. 1 43) above), the RC formation is similar. The verbs are in immediate sequence with the
preposition following:
   (4. 1 8 1 )   Andigpoi    di-no   ni-hara            ni-nggum               bak
                 elder       REL-3SG l EXC-ask          l EXC-hungry           to
                 pima noni rok.
                 that   he      push
                 The elder that we asked for something (because) we were hungry, he refused.
   The verb ndo 'to show; point', which always marks the Recipient with bak or its weakened
form bi- in main clauses, allows relativisation on the Recipient with 'stranded' preposition, as
in example (4. 1 82), but the RC may also be formed without bak, as in (4. 1 8 3).
   (4. 1 82)     Munggwom       die-no)   i-ndo               puig       bak

"But ri is not restricted to non-verbal predications. It also figures in sentences like (4.36) and
(4.37), which, in analogy to non-verbal predications, can be interpreted as being nominalised
by the presence of rio The declarative in (4.36) has the force of a command, while the ri­
marked clause in (4 . 3 7) forms a nominal to which the Topic marker ne can be applied with
an interrogative, i.e. rising, intonation.    (4.36)        li-gwam     tut      ril

                  You're going to Sam, are you?""
  The pronominal form nok '3SG' seems to function as a preposition, meaning 'be like',
which then forms a preposition phrase in non-verbal predication, as in:
    (4. 38)       Nyeni nok munggwom mlen he.
                  we     like child            small just
