"4.4. Negative particles
4.4.1. ‘No, by no means’
The particle ktejen expresses the modal meaning of impossibility;
it is used only in combination with standard negation:
(868)   a. kiejen          el+en-te-jek
           DP       NEG-+live-FUT-INTR:2SG
           ‘There is no way that you will be able to survive
           (there).’ [F31]

               tud-in
               he-DAT
               ‘They were not able to do him any harm at all.’ [T1]4.4.2. ‘Almost, only, hardly’
These and similar meanings are expressed by a group of apparently
related items derived from the stem mol-:(869)      moli            preventive particle (870)
           molin           ‘only’ (871a); ‘hardly’ (871b)
           moldo           ‘nothing but’ (872)
           molind’a        ‘hardly, almost not’ (873)
           molind’at       ‘nearly, almost, hardly’ (874).
The preventive particle molt is used only in combination with the
Future affirmative second person forms in sentences intended to
prevent unintended results of the hearer’s careless actions:
 (870)          towke    moli     aji-te-met
               dog      PREV      shoot-PUT-TR:2PL
               ‘Make sure that you do not shoot the dogs.’
The particle molzn           ‘only, hardly’        occurs only in the affirmative
Focus construction:
 (871)     a. ta        jug-de-ge      — irk-in          pulut-tege-k
               [there    see-3SG-Ds]      one-ATTR       old.man-AUGM-PRED

               ‘He saw that there was only one gigantic old man
               sitting.’ [F22]
           b. jud-ni-de-ge        jus’e-gi               mokn      l’e-l
               [see-PL-3-Ds] breathing-POss hardly be-SF
               ‘They saw that he was hardly breathing.’ (lit. ‘There
               was almost no breathing.’) [F37]
                                                                      Negation    499The particle moldo occurs only in sentences with existential                      (or
similar) semantics; all attested instances of this particle involve
body-part nouns, i.e., the meaning of the construction is, roughly:
‘(Instead   of somebody)       there     was/was         scen/was     present    only
her/his body part’. The particle triggers SF marking on the verb:
(872)   a. terike-gi    moldo          amun   gqodé-l
            wife-POss   only     — bone       __lic-SF
            ‘Only bones of his wife were lying there.’ [F48]
        b. ejre-t              jug-ni-de-ge        moldo       jo
            (walk-SS:IPFV]     [see-PL-3-Ds]       only        head

            be. visible-ITER-SF
            ‘They walked and saw only his head appearing from
            time to time.’
The particles molind’a and molind’at have similar meanings: they
signify that the situation referred to by the clause did take place,
but only with difficulty (or almost did not). Yet the former is
used in positive sentences (873), the latter, only in combination
with standard negation. In combination with the negation, the
particle marks the nonoccurrence of the situation as something
that barely happened,        i.e., the positive situation is presented as
having nearly/almost taken place (874). This particle is far more
frequent than molind’a.
(873)       molind’a    jaga-j                   ta

               ‘She nearly flew away.’ [F7]5. Speech-reporting                  strategies
Speech-act verbs fall into two groups. The first group comprises
verbs which can introduce reported speech but do not require the
reporting element to be present; it comprises intransitive speech-
act verbs (9.2.4.1) and their applicative derivatives which have an
O slot for the Addressee. The second group comprises the verbs
which have an O slot for the reporting element, transitive speech-
act verbs {9.2.6.2} and the labile verb mon- ‘say’.                    To be more
precise, these verbs require some speech-reporting expression to
be present, and this expression may but need not be represented
by an NP marked as the direct object. Thus, these verbs may
take an ordinary NP (9.2.6.2) or a regular nominal complement
(11.1.3.3)} as the reporting element.
      This section deals with syntactic strategies which are used pri-
marily for reporting speech, quotations (5.1) and indirect questions
(5.2). These strategies can also be applied, although infrequently,
for other types of clause-linkage (5.1.3, 5.3).","[517, 518, 519, 520]"
"1.1.3. Polarity1.1.3.1. Negative forms.                 The Negative Main forms are identical
for transitive and intransitive verbs              (Jochelson 1905; Krejnovich
1982:203-204): the first and second person markers are taken from
the Intransitive Main paradigm, the third person marker is zero
(for intransitive verbs, the regular 3sG marker -7 is possible as
well), see Table 15.
    The Imperative forms take the regular negative prefix, yet the
negative counterpart of the simple Imperative forms contains also
the Prohibitive suffix (Table 14); see 2.8 for examples. For further
details on negation, see 79.4,
1.1.3.2. The Affirmative prefix. The Affirmative marker me- can
be attached only to a Main form. The overt. Affirmative marker
is by no means obligatory, that is, the finite verb of an affirma-
tive sentence is normally not overtly marked for polarity.2° The
only exception is the Irrealis form, which is most often used in
combination with the Affirmative marker; sce 2.4. Otherwise, the
Affirmative marker can be used in order to emphasize the assertion
expressed by the finite verb.

 1.2. The Attributive forms
1.2.1. Formation
The Attributive forms are built by means of the (in)transitivity
morphs,      as singled out in 1.1.1:       the Active Attributive form is
derived by adding the suffix -j/e}, the Passive Attributive form,
by the same suffixes that are used for the OF forms (see Table
13). The Passive Attributive markers normally cross-reference the
subject of the relative clause.       However,    the form in -me              can be
used as a generic (“impersonal”) Passive Attributive form.                      Both
types of Attributive forms can contain the regular Future marker
(280), although such examples are rather infrequent (see 2.3 on
the functions of the Future).
 (280)    a. tet-kele       tat jelo-hude jog-to-t-ée
             [you-ACC       CA back-DIR arrive-CAUS-FUT-ATTR]
             §oromo       oj-l’e
             person NEG-be(NEG:38G)
             ‘There is nobody who would bring you back.’ [T1|
          b. tay    met      pahu-nu-t-me                     mieste      aj
             that   [I        seine-IPFV-FUT-ATTR:1sG]        place       CP
             el+-uke-j
             NEG-+cxit-PFV(NEG:3SG)
             ‘That place where I am going to put my seine has not
             appeared yet (=it is still under the water).’
The Passive Attributive forms are morphologically distinguished
from the OF forms in that they cannot get the modal markers
{that is, they cannot be marked for the Inferential, Prospective
and Irrealis meanings), while the OF forms have the full range of
finite morphology.

tails on the Focus construction and its formal relation to relative

"1. Imperative          sentences
The imperative sentence type is distinguished by means of verb
morphology, that is, by use of the Imperative verb forms (see
6.1.1). Therefore, this sentence type is described and exemplified
in 6.2.8; this section contains only some marginal notes.
    In order to propose a common action (i.e., instead of the 1PL
Imperative), the main (Indicative) 1PL form can be used, with or,
less frequently, without the Future marker (see also 6.2.3).
(812)   a. wted%-din     irk-in     mieste Sagal’a-t-il’?
           [speak-SUP} one-ATTR place       gather-FUT-INTR:1PL
           ‘Let us gather in one place in order to speak.’ [K1]

              CA             get.prepared-INTR:1PL
               ‘Then let us prepare everything.’ [F31]
With the second person Imperative, the particle jag ‘come (on)’
can be used:
 (813)     a. jag gon             logkara Sobohora kes’t-k
              IMP go{IMP:2sG) | spoon     plate     bring-IMP:28G
              ‘Come on, go and bring spoons and plates.’ [F13]

              IMP     quickly     water-DAT        go.down-PL-IMP:2
               ‘Come on, go quickly and bring water.’ [F29]
           c. ug-re-p-tie,        jag    ukej-delle             gaqga-nin

               your    cow         [rope-PRPR:CAUS-SS:PFV|            give-PL-IMP:2
               ‘Children, go, tie your cow and give it to
               grandfather.’ [F27|
This particle can be etymologically related to the verb jaqa- ‘ar-
rive, reach’.
    The subject of the Imperative is normally omitted (813), yet
this is not an obligatory feature of this sentence type (814).
 (814)     a. id% tet met-ul Sgrile-
              now you I-ACC paint-CAUS(IMP:2SG)
              ‘Now paint me!’ [F5]
           b. tet     and’e-g                      met-ul

               ‘Always eat!’ [F9]
See 6.2.8 for further examples.
   The Imperative is incompatible                  with     the grammatical       Focus
marking (6.1.1.2).
                                                                 Questions   4752. Questions
 2.1. Polar questions
2.1.1. Ordinary polar questions
The ordinary polar question (yes-no question) is not marked mor-
phologically; the interrogative meaning is expressed only by a ris-
ing intonation contour (Krejnovich 1982:150). A question can have
the form of an affirmative (815) or negative (816) clause:

2.1.2. Alternative questions and the disjunctive/interrogative par-
        ticle du
Disjunction in alternative questions is expressed by a clause-final
particle du, which is repeated after each of the disjoined alterna-
tives:

If the disjoined alternatives are an assertion and its negation, the
latter can be represented by the negative form of the existential
verb, oj-l’e (lit. ‘there is no’); see (818). In this case, the disjunc-
tive particle can be absent from the first clause (819a), or from
both clauses (819b).

explicitly expressed alternative:

This particle can also be used in declarative contexts. In two
examples in my corpus, it is used clause-internally in order to
disjoin constituents of a declarative clause (821). In one example,
it is used to disjoin declarative clauses (822).

2.1.3. The contrastive/negative particle eil’e
The particle efl’e has the general semantic effect of contrasting two
propositions, one of which remains implicit. The implicit propo-
sition is presented as false, in contrast with that expressed by the
clause. This particle is used in Indicative sentences (2.1.3.1), in
tag questions (2.1.3.2), and for negative responses (2.1.3.3).
2.1.3.1. In Indicative sentences, the clause-final particle ell’e is
used to contrast the proposition expressed in the clause to what
might be presupposed (823a), apparently evident {823b), expected
(823c), or desired (823d):

              ‘Our place was far away, after all (however willing we
              were to reach it).’2.1.3.2. This particle can be used for a sort of tag question. It
signifies that the proposition expressed by the clause is assumed
by the speaker to be true, and contrasts this assumption with the
potential negative response.

polar question (825b).

2.1.4. Ask-to-repeat verb
There      is a special           verb   used    for requests      to repeat         the previ-
ous utterance          (Krejnovich          1982:151).      Such     requests are built
as questions containing only the second person form of the verb
monohot-""4 (cf. mon- ‘say’):
 (826)         tay      para-ge            tat   mon-de-ge         irk-in
               [that time-LOC              CA    say-3SG-Ds]       one-ATTR

               ‘At that time, when he said this, the One-eyed one
               replied: “Wow, what have you said?”’ [F31]
Note that the same function can be fulfilled by means of a question-
word question with the basic speech act verb mon- ‘say’:
 (827)         e-e     Saget        lem-dik         = mon-me?
               Int]    now         what-PRED         say-OF:2SG
               ‘Hi, what have you just said?’ [F31]2.2.     Question-word questions
2.2.1. Questioning constituents of the main clause
Any constituent of the clause can be questioned (see 7.1.3 for in-
terrogative pro-forms used for such questions}. The linear position
                                                                Questions   481of the question word is rather flexible; it can occur either in the
position most typical for the constituent type (831b), (832b) or be
sentence-initial; see (830b), (831a).°%
   The verb normally takes the Interrogative form (see 6.1.1.1);
however,   the Indicative main      forms    are also possible;      see, e.g.,
(828b), (835a), with the exception of first-person forms which can
be only Interrogative. Questions to the S/O constituent obliga-
torily involve Focus marking, including the Focus-indicating verb
form. The following examples illustrate question-word questions
to other types of constituents.%

The descriptive nominal predicate (see 72.1.1) can be questioned
by putting an interrogative pronoun in the predicative position:
(838)   a. neme-pe-lek?
           what-PL-PRED
           ‘Who are they?’ [F31]
        b. tugn    tet-ke        neme-lek?

                  who+CoOP-ITR:28G
                  ‘Who are you?’
The verbal predicate can be questioned by means of the combina-
tion of the question word godo ‘how’ with the verb a- ‘make’ or
l’e- ‘be’ (see 7.1.3). The former option is employed when both the
A participant and the O participant of the action being questioned
are specified or implied (839), the latter, if only one participant
is specified, independently of its role in the situation being ques-
tioned, i.e., such a question can mean both ‘What did/will X do?’
(840) and ‘What happened/will happen to X?’ (841).                         The neg-
ative marker on such a complex signifies negation of a possible
situation involving specified participants (841b).

Any      noun    modifier can be questioned.                The following examples
illustrate questions to the possessive modifier (842), the attributive
modifier (843), and to the scalar quantifier (844).

Constituents of non-finite clauses can be questioned, yet such ex-
amples are rather rare:

              ‘How many people are in which place?’
 2.3. Negative/dubitative use of questions
The form of a question-word question can be used to negate the
proposition expressed by the clause, or to present it as doubtful.
In the combination with the Future form of the verb (6.2.3), this
gives the meaning of impossibility or at least crucial complications
in accomplishing the action. The question word of manner godo
gives a more general meaning                  (847), other question words can
be conceived as specifying a particular component of a situation
which is lacking (848).
(847) a. inluge             met    ner         naha     eris’                 godo

               ‘What will reach it? (= there is nothing that can reach
               it).’ [F58]
If there is no Future marker, a question-like clause with godo can
express just somewhat emphasized negation (849), a clause with
noyon ‘what for’, the absence of reason (purposelessness) of the
action that has taken place (850).

 3.1. Exclamations
3.1.1. Question-like exclamations
Exclamations are constructed like the question-word questions,
yet the clause normally contains a word providing the “answer” to
the formally questioned element (cf. ‘what’ and ‘good’ in (851a),
‘how’ and ‘well’ in (851b)):
{851}   a. jowluge             godimie    omo-s’e               towke-die-k

The interjection jekkejti is used to express an unpleasant surprise;
it can be followed by a question-like exclamation:

3.2.     Optative
There is a special construction which signifies that the situation
is strongly desired, yet the speaker cannot bring it about; in par-
ticular, the fulfillment of this wish may depend on some other
person(s) (855b) or be simply impossible (855d).                    This construc-
tion is built as the combination of the optative particle gonoho and
the Result Nominal form (6.1.3.4) of the verb. The construction
is subjectless; the implied primary participant of the situation is
the speaker.

A similar meaning can be expressed by the combination of the
manner question word godo and the Future Interrogative 1sc:

 4.1, Standard negation
4.1.1. Sentential negation
The     standard     sentential negation is expressed             by attaching the
prefix e/+ to the finite verb, as illustrated by (857) and many
other examples in this grammar (see also 6.1.1.3.1):
(857)     a. tamun-ge         met-kele     el+jan-ni

              ‘That dog did not eat that.’ [F20]
See 6.2.8 for negation of the Imperative.
   The scope of negation can be limited to an adverbial:
 (858)     a. tiy   pay                  met-telle         n’u-de

               ‘At that time, the earth had not appeared well yet (=
               was not sufficiently visible).’ [F9]
           c. €aSet           el+kel-te-je

           d. tuda                tay      ttte    id     el+modo-jil%
              that.time           that     like    now    NEG+live-INTR:1PL
               ‘Now we do not live like those ones (lived) at that
               time.’ [K1]
See 4.1.3 on adverbial negation.
   Note that if the standard negative prefix occurs with a noun in
the Nominative form (which happens very rarely outside of some
                                                                        Negation   493specific verb patterns; see 12.1.3.2), it can have only the privative
meaning (‘without’), that is, the negated Nominative form is used
instead of the Privative form; see (5.5.2):
 (859)      tat jug-de-ge     el+qar      godo-}
            [CA see-3SG-Ds] NEG+skin lie-INTR:3SG
            ‘Then he saw that it lay without skin.’ [F51|
4.1.2. Focus and negation
Constituent negation (by means of the standard negative marker)
is possible only with the Focus constituent (860a). The scope of
standard negation on the verb in the Focus construction is confined
to the Focus constituent (860b)-(860c). Both types of examples
are extremely infrequent.
(860)    a. ef      met-ek      tat        Ve-l
            NEG     I-PRED      CA         be-SF
            ‘It is not me who is doing this.’

            ‘The person we cannot find anywhere is Noah.’ [F9]
         c. muge-nit                 tude         moho      el} igude-mle
            {undress-CONN]           his          hat      NEG+take.off-OF:3SG
            ‘He undressed himself, and it was only his hat that he
            did not take off.’ [I]
4.1.3. Negated adverbials
Two adverbs, juke ‘far’ (with its Locative forms; see 4.2.2) and as’
~ ite ‘long’ take the standard negative marker.®®
(861)    a. of        el+jike         WVe-t-i
            water    NEG+far          be-FUT-INTR:3SG
            ‘The water will not be far.’ [F3]
494      Chapter 13. Sentence types and negation           b. el+iéie            l’e-lle           tan     = pulut      aj
               [NEG+long         be-Ss:PFV]        that old.man         CP
               jagta-La-nu-l’el               jenzod’e-n’-u-t
               sing-0-INGR-IPFV-INFR(3SG) dream-PRPR-0-SS:IPFV
               ‘After being there for a short time, that old man began
               to sing again, dreaming.’ [K4]
This construction is in clear semantic contrast to negative marking
on the verb (cf. (861c) and (862a)) and to double negation, both
on the adverb and on the verb (cf. (861a) and (862b)).
 (862)     a. as’       elf l’e-lle                02          nodo   kie-s’
               {long NEG+be-ss:PFV]                water      bird    come-INTR:3SG
               ‘After being absent for a long time, the duck
               came.’ [F52]
           b. titte    arga     omni       ejuke          07-l’e-yi
              they     AD       people     NEG:far       NEG-be-3PL:INTR
               ‘Around them, there were no people nearby.’ [F22]
The negative marker is also attested with some adverbial pro-
forms, but in these examples               it entails negative marking on the
verb:
 (863)     a. tanide            eli qodo      _—_el-t gon-moZi-je
               there:DIR        NEG+how       NEG+g0-PRSP-INTR:1SG
               ‘I can by no means go there.’ [F31]

               ‘From now on do not be (behave) like this.’ [F9]
See 4.2.1 for negative adverbials.","[510, 511, 512, 513, 514]"

Notes1.   The monographic description (Krejnovich 1958) is concerned mainly
     with the grammar of Tundra Yukaghir, with references to the Kolyma
     Yukaghir   materials   collected   by Jochelson;   (Krejnovich     1979)   also
     sketches the Tundra Yukaghir grammar.
2.   Note that if my description of a phenomenon         attested     by Jochelson
     and/or Krejnovich differs from that suggested by these scholars in more
     than the degree of detail, I usually indicate the deviation from the pri-
     mary description simply by “cf.” in front of the relevant reference, with-
     out going into the discussion of the controversy, in order not to over-
     load the book with details which are hardly interesting for its potential
     readers. However, if the differences appear to be significant, they are
     described explicitly.
3.   The examples from published texts are indicated by a letter (“F” for
     (Nikolaeva 1989), “K” for (Maslova 2001), and “T” for the texts in-
     cluded in this book) followed by the number of the text (according
     to the sources’ numbering). The transcription of Nikolaeva’s examples
     (which are presented in Cyrillic-based orthography) is mine. Note that
     a number of examples from (Nikolaeva 1989) contain some deviations
     from the published source, which reflects the results of discussing these
     sentences with informants; a reference to the published source has been
     preserved if such deviations are relatively insignificant (including car-
     rections of misprints). The examples from unpublished texts appear
     without any indication of the source, the examples elicited in interviews
     are indicated by the letter “I”.
4.   The materials published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1997 have not been in-
     cluded in the corpus of examples employed for this grammar precisely
     because I have had no chance to check them with other informants.
5.   For the same reason, I employ the examples cited by E. A. Krejnovich
     only in exceptional cases, simply because he normally does not indi-
     cate whether a particular example has been elicited in an interview or
     has been attested in a text. Furthermore, he mentions that he “con-
584    Notes      structed” some of his Kolyma Yukaghir examples on the basis of other
      data (1982:249); this method of cxemplification is never employed in
      this grammar.
      These percentages are based on data collected in 1987 by a joint expedi-
      tion of the Institute of Linguistics and the Institute of Ethnography of
      the USSR Academy of Sciences (St.Petersburg branches) and published
      by Nikolay Vakhtin (1992:50, Table 1).
      See (Vakhtin 1992:57-58) for a detailed description of how these ratings
      were obtained.
      In their reviews to an earlier version of this grammar,       Bernard    Com-
      rie and Christian Lehmann suggested that this system might. be more
      appropriately described as advanced tongue root (rather than palatal)
      harmony. Since a justifiable choice between these options could only
      be based on a thorough phonetic investigation of the phenomenon, I
      have opted for the term traditionally adopted in the Yukaghir studies
      (Collinder 1940:80-88; Krejnovich 1982:20-21; Nikolaeva and Helimsky
      1996:157).
      The voiced obstruent /Z/ does not occur in morpheme-final position.
      The final /n/ of the verb stem mon- ‘speak, say’ is dropped before the
      morph -d’e, e.g., mo-d’e ‘I said’, mo-d’ek “You (sc) said’, etc.
11.   The allomorph -j of the attributive marker -j# does not occur after
      consonants.
12.   The Resultative marker, the Stative marker, the copula 0-, and the final
      -o- in the qualitative and quantitative verbs are notably similar, so that,
      at least diachronically, they might be assumed to instantiate the same
      morpheme (see 6.3.6.1). Then, the phonologicaliy unmotivated alterna-
      tion /7/ ~ /d’/ is restricted to a smail set of morphological environ-
      ments. A further diachronic hypothesis might be that the morphemes
      constituting these environments used to contain a final sonorant, which
      triggered this alternation (see 3.3.1). This hypothesis is supported by
      Tundra Yukaghir data, where final /i/ of the Resultative marker and of
      qualitative stems like in (67) is still preserved in some contexts (Kre-
      jnovich 1982:98-99); sec also 6.3.6.
13.   That is why there is no special chapter on adverbs in this grammar.
14.   Krejnovich (1982:105) describes the forms of “degree of comparison"" for
      qualitative verbs. According to his observations, some nominal forms
      of the verb (referred to as Subject Nominal and Relative Nominal in
      the present grammar,       see 6.1.3.6-6.1.3.7) can signify a higher degree
      of quality, especially when     combined   with the nominal   Augmentative
      marker (see 5.6.1.2).
15.   See 5.5.5.2 on integration of Russian adjectives into Yukaghir grammar.
16.   Small    capitals denote   consonants   that can undergo   devoicing    after a
                                                                             Notes          8
                                                                                       oH
                                                                                            cn
       final voiceless obstruent of a stem, as described in 3.3.2.1.
 17.   In this sentence, the Plural marking on the verb is controlied by the
       Locative NP; for a description of such constructions, see 12.1.2.3.
18.    Krejnovich (1982:249) suggests that the A participant in Kolyma Yuk-
       aghir may get the Predicative marking as well; however,          his examples
       of this phenomenon contain detransitivized verbs (with the suffix -ze-,
       see §.4.4.2}, so that the Predicative marker is in fact attached to the §
       participant.
19.    For O marking in non-finite clauses, see 9.1.2.2.
20.    Krejnovich     (1982:253;   256)   observes a correlation between      the choice
       of -fe)k on the head and the presence of an attributive modifier; this
       correlation is in accordance with the functional account suggested here.
2i.    Krejnovich (1982:250-251; 256-257) considers presence vs. absence of a
       (lexical) noun modifier as the major factor which determines the choice
       of the Accusative vs. Instrumental marking.
22.    The combination ug+qo- ‘child+be-’ is apparently lexicalized with the
       meaning ‘be young’
23.    The verb inflection has been described by Jochelson (1905) and discussed
       by Krejnovich (1982:184-216). Krejnovich (1982:201-208), in contrast to
       (Jochelson 1905), claims that the transitive verb in Kolyma Yukaghir
       has the SF form in -i. This claim strongly contradicts my data, see
       (Maslova. 1997) for details and discussion. The absence of the transitive
       SF paradigm in Kolyma Yukaghir represents one of the major divergent
       features between the Yukaghir languages, as Tundra Yukaghir has a
       specialized transitive SF form with zero inflection (Krejnovich 1955;
       1982:209-210),
24.    Krejnovich (1982:149-151) includes the form in -m both in the Inter-
       rogative and in the Imperative paradigm; see /3.3.1.1 and 12.3.2 for
       Interrogative applications of this form.
25.    See 5.4.1.3, 12.2 for further examples and discussion.
26.    This is a clear point of divergence between Kolyma and Tundra Yuk-
       aghir.   In the latter, the affirmative pre-verb is employed        much       more
       frequently and can be analyzed as Predicate Focus marker                (Maslova
       1989; Comrie 1992; Fortescue 1996).
27.    The -ge- ~ -h- ~ -j- alternation in the third person Conditional DS con-
       verbs instantiates the same morphophonemic rule as the alternation of
       the Accusative marker after the Possessive marker (see 5.1.3}; in fact,
       the Accusative marker may          be assumed   to have   developed     from    the
       generic locative marker.
28.    According to Krejnovich (1982:167), the forms in -l-ge(ne) are used with
       the singular subject and the forms in -l-u-ke(ne) express the plurality
       of subject. This correlation is not confirmed by my data. The form in
586    Notes      -l-u-ge(ne) is absent from the paradigm presented by Krejnovich.
29.   Normally, the controlling clause is the next clause of a chain. See 1.1.1
      for further details.
30.   In fact, these suffixes might have been described as expressing Aktion-
      sarten. Krejnovich (1982:121ff) describes all the suffixes under discus-
      sion in this chapter as sposby protekaniya dejstuiya (i.e., Aktionsarten).
31.   It should be noted that the Result Nominal cannot. be analyzed as the
      Action Nominal form of the Resultative (although formally it might be
      possible), just. because the Resultative formation can be applied to a se-
      mantically restricted class of verbs (see 3.6.2), while the Result Nominal
      form is available for any verb.
32.   In Tundra Yukaghir two variants of the regular causative suffix, -s- and
      -se-, are distributed according to the general morphophonemic rule de-
      scribed in 3.3.4.1 (see Krejnovich 1982:68,; Maslova 1993:273).
      See 9.3.1.2.3 on the /d’/ ~ /n/ alternation.
      My informants seemed to be able to construct the form by attaching
      the nominal Instrumental marker to a pronominal stem, but not to use
      it, and it does not occur in texts.
      Here the Free Possessive form functions as a nominal modifier (see 8.2.1
      on this construction).
      Notably, this nominalizer was rendered as -bon by W.Jochelson      (1900),
      which makes it possible to posit the original form *bgn.
      This meaning is rendered by the noun kgnme ‘mate; the other’.
      In one example in [F9], the temporal demonstrative form tude appears
      to be used as a noun modifier (‘former’), see (571b). Since there are
      no other examples of this sort, this phenomenon is not discussed in the
      grammar.
      In this chapter,   the internal structure of complex NPs is indicated by
      angle brackets in the interlinear gloss.
      The Possessive Attributive marking (2.3.2) constitutes an exception to
      this rule.
      In this chapter, two separate referential entities invoked by an NP with
      nominal modifier are called ""Possessor” and *Possessed”, independently
      of the exact semantics of the relation between them.
      This is about the hero of a fairy-tale who has a bubble for a head, and
      that is why his name is Bubblehead.
      The thing is a straw and a worm at the same time.
      This rule does not cover the cases of pronominal Possessive marking, as
      described in 2.2.1.1.
      This meaning is not ruled out by cultural knowledge, since polygamy
      used to be allowed in the Yukaghir tribes.
      As described in 2.1.2, the construction is ambiguous between the posses-
                                                                        Notes   587      sive and the apposition interpretations, so the reading ‘the small goose’s
      daughter’ is also possible.
      This formulation does not take into account the possessive use of the
      zero marking, since in this case Attributive marking is not an option.
      This option was suggested to me by Bernard Comrie.
      Note that the Comitative markers in this example introduce the sec-
      ondary participant of a reciprocal situation (see 9.2.8}; two Comitative
      participants are conjoined by the connective adverb.
      See Note 127.
      In this chapter, the core participant. roles are shown by indexes A and O
      in the interlincar gloss unless they are recoverable from the case marking.
      See 5.4.1.6 on the semantic difference between the Accusative proper
      and the O-marking Instrumental
      This phenomenon was described by Krejnovich as “quasi-ergativity”
      (1982:232).
      I am grateful to Maria Polinsky for drawing my attention to this issue
      many   years ago.
      A special case not dealt with here is represented by relativization of the
      Possessor (see 1.3.1.4 for details).
56.   This meaning is impossible for Nominal clauses, simply because the head
      denotes a situation (not a countable referential entity).
57.   Note that this property is similar to topicality in Givén’s sense (i.e., topic
      continuity and persistence), with the qualification that the structuring
      of a text into episodes must be taken into account.
      The only exception may be the first and second person pronouns, which
      tend to trigger Accusative marking in all instances, sce (609a)}, (612a).
      In my corpus, there are no examples of Neutral (= Pronominal Ac-
      cusative) marking of these pronouns with third-person A. It should be
      noted, however, that my informants do rate the Neutral option gram-
      matical in such cases. Apart from this, the Accusative marking of the
      first and second person pronouns can be vicwed as an instantiation of
      the more general rule suggested here, insofar as they tend to refer to the
      most prominent entities in any episode they occur.
59.   An entity is taken to “occur” in some clause if it is involved in the
      situation being described, independently of whether: it is represented by
      an overt, NP within that clause.
60.   Note that the Accusative NP in such examples may represent the O
      constituent of the finite clause, cf. 10.1.3.1, 26.1.3.3.
61.   This property is shared by the Dative Experiencer as well (see 2.7.1).
62.   To be more precise, there is no convincing way to draw the distinc-
      tion between a sequence of independent clauses and a sentence built by
      juxtaposition of finite clauses.
588    Notes 63,   The term “clause conjunction” is used here to refer to any syntactic link
       between two or more clauses all of which have the same illocutionary
       function.
64,    In the latter function, it is opposed to specialized adverbial clauses, a
       relatively minor strategy for clausal modification of propositions (see
       11.4, 13.5.3.1).
       Some deviations from the strictly subject-oriented switch-reference pro-
       cedure are described in 14.1.3).
       “Perch” is interpreted as a proper name within the context of this fairy
       tale, hence the Nominative form in the Focus position.
       In this example, the detransitivized verb ley-de- ‘eat’ is used despite the
       presence of the direct object; this deviation is presumably entailed by
       the Desiderative suffix which is typically used with the detransitivized
       verb, but not with its transitive counterpart (leg- ‘eat’).
68.    The linear structure is posited for the DS clause and the controlling
       finite clause. The relation between the SS clause and the DS clause is
       more appropriately described in terms of nesting, see 2.4.2 for a further
       discussion of such examples.
69.    In this example, the underlined NP fills the Ablative slot of the verb
       londe- ‘separate (from)’, which is absent from the pattern of the verb
       paja- ‘carry’.
70.    Note that this application of the ordinary chaining is possible only under
       the specific mode of reference (1.2).
71.    This function appears to be fairly typical for sentence-initial temporal
       clauses across languages (Thompson and Longacre 1985:212).
72.    See 12.2.4 for a description of $s-chains with shared Focus.
73.    The     glosses for predictive conditional   constructions   are based on the
       context, as well on (Russian) translations provided by informants.
74.    In this example, the controller of switch reference is the Possessor of the
       finite-clause subject, see 14.1.3.2 for a description of this phenomenon.
75.    This example is one of very few exceptions from the rule of switch ref-
       erence: the DS form is used despite the shared subject.
76.    The term “complementation” refers to constructions where a clause de-
       noting a situation or fact fills a valence slot of the main verb (Noonan
       1985:42). Note that two of the three nominal verb forms employed
       for complementation, the Result Nominal (6.1.3.4) and the Prospective
       Nominal (6.1.3.5), can denote entities as well. In this case, they func-
       tion like ordinary NPs and can appear in a clause independently of the
       valence properties of the main verb. Such constructions are outside the
       scope of this section.
77.    However, see 2.2 for a group of verbs taking the Supine complements.
78.    This is the only type of phase verb existing in Yukaghir: other phase
                                                                           Notes      589      meanings are expressed morphologically {see 6.3).           See also 2.1 for an
      alternative complementation pattern for the verbs of termination.
79.   Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subject-to-
      subject raising.
80.   Note that the nominal complement of an intransitive verb of termina-
      tion fills the S slot of the matrix clause; in the pattern with converb, this
      slot is filled by the primary participant of the complement clause situ-
      ation. Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subject-
      to-subject raising.
81.   See 9.2.7.2.3 for the alternative pattern for the verb erd’- ‘want’.
82.   The Applicative may be thus taken as a morphological marking of the
      subject-to-object or object-to-object raising.
83.   There is a single interview example of relativization of the Dative con-
      stituent   (with the Passive Attributive     form,   see 6.1.3.3),   yet there is
      no text evidence confirming this possibility. It should be noted that the
      relativization of constituents other than core participants belongs to the
      class of phenomena, which do not lend themselves to reliable “interview”
      investigation, at least not in the case of Yukaghir; the only thing which
      can be said is that such constructions are not produced readily and are
      not attested in texts. No statements of absolute grammatical constraints
      can be made; yet even if such constructions are grammatically possible,
      they are far more “marginal” then Locative relativization and Possessor
      relativization.
84.   The only attested example is controversial, see comments to the sentence
      in (745).
85.   Note that in this example the Russian word svad’ba ‘wedding’ is used
      instead of the Yukaghir Action Nominal form n’e+mid’ul ‘taking each
      other’ with apparently similar meaning, which makes it possible to sug-
      gest that here this word refers not to the action itself, but to the place
      of festive activities.
&6.   Note that for same-subject situations, this meaning is expressed by
      means of the Perfective Converb, see 10.2.2.
87.   Otherwise, the causal relationship can be expressed by means of the
      Imperfective SS form; see 1.2.4.1.
88.   This property distinguishes a nominal predicate with the bound copula
      from the Stative form constructed with the same marker (see 5.5.5.2).
89.   Note that Predicative marking on the object is impossible in this con-
      struction, presumably because of the Predicative marking on the verb
      form.
90.   Krejnovich    (1982:208-209)   considers   this   construction   a part      of the
      Focus-marking system (for A Focus marking, which cannot be achieved
      by means of the regular grammatical Focus construction, see 12.2.1).
590     Notes       That approach is not accepted in this grammar because of significant
       differences in the role these constructions play in the grammar and dis-
       course. Most importantly, the construction with the Result Nominal
       is not obligatory in the environments which trigger compulsory Focus
       marking on the §/O participant (see 12.3.1); see also (Maslova 1997)
       for further details.
 91.   The “locative” pattern for predication of possession is presumably in-
       duced or at least strongly supported by Russian influence, where such
       a pattern constitutes the major option.
 92.   Note that a logically possible variant of dealing with such a situation
       would be to put the Focus O constituent in the clause-initial position,
       before the A constituent (which would have been then included into
       the scope of assertion). Yet this variant is prohibited by the word-order
       rules, i.e., this constituent order is not allowed in the Focus construction;
       see 9.1.5.1.
 93.   This ne can be assumed to be just the Russian negative marker.
 94.   Krejnovich (1982:151} gives the whole person /number paradigm of this
       verb, yet all forms but those of second person appear to be out of use.
 95.   In most instances these word order options cannot be distinguished (just
       because the subject is very often omitted).
 96.   For examples of questions to the $/O constituent, see 12.3.1.1.
 97.   Note that the phonological integrity of the complex gedo-l’e- is indicated
       by the alternation of the final /e/ with /a/ before the inferential marker,
       which shows that the stem as a whole belongs to the class of back stems,
       see 3.2.4.1).
 98.   The combination    el+juke can be fused into ejuke ‘not far’.
 99.   The interrogative pronoun kin ‘who’ does not take the negative prefix.
100.   This use of the manner question word is quite typical for colloquial
       Russian.
101.   Note that the possessive relationship between the subject of the main
       clause and that. of the subordinate clause is expressed by means of the
       bound (non-reflexive) Possessive marking (see (893)).
102.   Note that the verbs /’e- ‘be’ and a- ‘make’ can also combine with Inter-
       rogative adverbials to build questions to predicates (13.2.2.2).
103.   The omitted piece of the text represents the direct speech (what the
       brother was saying while he was crying).
104.   Thus, the grammatical Focus shows a predicate-like behavior; see 12.2
       on the syntactic status of the Focus.
105.   Thus, such a quantifier shows the same behavior as the grammatical
       Focus; see 8.3 on the semantics of this construction.
106.   Note that the comitative strategy of NP conjunction implies the single-
       event interpretation.
                                                                   Notes   591107.   This example involves an unexpected OF form in the first clause (the
       case marking and the word order indicate rather topicalization of the O
       constituent). Presumably, the narrator changed his plan: he was going
       to speak about karbasses, but then decided to mention that other people
       made other kind of boats.

"4.2.     The negative marker n’e
4.2.1. Negative quantifiers and adverbials
Generally, negative quantifiers and adverbials are built by means
of the prefix n’e- added to the interrogative pro-forms (see 7.1.4.2);
the negative quantifier for human participants is nilg? ‘nobody’.
A negative pro-form requires the presence of standard                          negation

within onc clause (864d).

            ‘There isn’t anything anywhere.’ [F37]
This construction is made up exactly as its Russian counterpart,
including the formal identity of the negative prefix used with the
pro-forms (cf, the Yukaghir standard negative marker in (863a) in
a formally similar construction, which is, however, far less frequent.
than the construction with n’e). Therefore, it seems plausible to
consider this construction a loan from Russian. An additional
piece of evidence in favor of this hypothesis is given by Tundra
Yukaghir, where there are no negative pro-forms with n’e; instead,
contrastive/free-choice pro-forms are used in negative sentences
(Krejnovich 1982:222-225).","[514, 515]"
"4.2.2. The negative marker n’e with nouns
In some examples, the negative marker n’e occurs in prenominal
position, in combination with standard negation on the verb, with
a meaning like ‘not even’ or ‘neither ...nor...’:?

In contrast with the formally identical marking on the pro-forms,
such constructions are extremely rare.","[515, 516]"
"1.4.7. Functions of the Connective form
The Connective form is formally identical to the nominal Comi-
tative form in -n’it (see 5.4.2.3.2). In comparison to other switch-
reference forms, it occurs rather infrequently and seems to signify
some sort of contrastbetween the connected events.

1.4.8. Functions of the Negative converb
The Negative converb is formally identical and semantically close
to the nominal Privative form (see 5.5.2). This form signifies that
the expectable accompanying event did not take place. If the
idea of counter-expectation is absent, the negated forms of other
166      Chapter    6.   Verb morphologyconverbs are used (see (312b), (315a) above).                  In this sense, the
Negative converb can be seen as the negative counterpart of the
Connective form (1.4.7).

"3.   Accents   and   varieties
Given the small number of speakers nowadays, any notes about
dialectal or social varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir can only be spec-
ulative. However, the currently spoken idiolects are so distinct
as to prevent the best Yukaghir speakers from rating each other’s
language competence highly; Table 5 shows that not one got the
highest rating for language competence from any expert. These
distinctions, as well as the reluctance to acknowledge each other’s
competence, seem to result from two factors of language variation:
    First, the Yukaghirs currently living in Nelemnoye represent
two regional groups of Yukaghirs which used to exist before the
collectivization in 1931, One group roamed mainly along the Kor-
kodon River, the other along the Yasachnaya River. These groups
apparently spoke two distinct varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir. The
most notable phonological distinction concerned the labial vowel
harmony, which was characteristic of the Korkodon variety and is
24     Chapter 2. Kolyma   Yukaghir and its speakersstill maintained in the speech of some Kolyma Yukaghirs; one of
my consultants, A. E. Shadrina, a daughter of a Korkodon Yuk-
aghir, regularly labializes vowels in suffixes after /o/, which distin-
guishes her accent from that spoken by most of my consultants.
The same distinction was described by E. A. Krejnovich on the
basis of her father’s accent (Krejnovich 1982:21-22).
    Secondly, and most importantly, the Kolyma Yukaghir language
is undergoing an extremely fast modification, so that the varieties
of the language spoken even by neighboring generations are clearly
distinct. This seems to be a part of the survival strategy cho-
sen by the language in the aggressive sociolinguistic environment.
Each gencration faces a simple choice: given that their mother
tongue is not their first language, they can either reject speaking
that language and let it disappear, or simply speak as they can
(cf.   Vakhtin 1992:79-80).           So far, each successive age group has
chosen the second alternative. Quite predictably, the resulting
variety differs from that spoken by thcir parents in being more
significantly influenced by Russian.               Furthermore, it can be rated
as “corrupted” not only by the previous generation, but by the
speakers themselves. Yet, to some extent, this strategy of “survival
through modification” is approved by the oldest speakers, that is,
the speakers of the “purest” existing variety: they themselves do
use a special simplified Yukaghir-based jargon when addressing
younger people, just in order to be understood, yet to maintain
communication in their mother tongue.
    Now, it is clear that this strategy has been applied at least
since the end of the 19% century, which means that the current
group of “best speakers” used to represent a “corrupted” version
a couple of dozens years ago. Some of them are aware of the
differences between their own language and the language their
parents used to speak          (occasionally, my       questions were answered
like “I would say it this way, but my father would have said it
differently”). Even more so, they are aware of “mistakes” in the
language spoken by their fellow-citizens, hence low ratings of their
language competence.
                            The effect of language contact en Kolyma   Yukaghir   254, The effect of language contact on Kolyma Yukaghir
The most important contact languages have been Yakut and Rus-
sian. Now the contact with Russian is more significant. Russian
loanwords play an eminent role even in the Yukaghir everyday
vocabulary, e.g.:(13)   Yukaghir                                Russian
       terike       ‘wife, old woman’          starukha
       korobe       ‘cow’                      korova
       Sgstok       ‘staff?                    shestok
       uzzuo        ‘gun’                      ruzhjoNow Russian lexical items are being borrowed practically without
phonetic changes. Moreover, the borderline between the Yukaghir
lexicon and the Russian one is likely not to be “taken into account”
in the course of natural communication: almost nobody hesitates
to insert a Russian word into a Yukaghir utterance. In contrast
with this, the words borrowed earlier (like those given in (13)) used
to be changed according to the Yukaghir phonetic rules and gen-
erally preserve their Yukaghir phonetic form in the contemporary
speech,
   The instances of occasional code-mixing are numerous, cf. the
following examples (Russian grammatical and lexical items are in
boldface):
(14)   a. potomu éto        bogaty7-qo0:-t              gude-j
          [because          rich-TRNSF-SS:IPFV          become-INTR:38G

         ‘Because he became a rich person, that is why they used
         to go there and back (swarm around him).’ [F38]
       b. davaj    tude-gele    andt-na            davajz   kebe-sil’i      da
         INGR      he-acc       ask-TR:3PL        [HORT go:1PL             CONJ
         kebe-s alt
         go:1PL]
         ‘They began to ask him (repeatedly), let us go, let us
         go.’ [F36]
26      Chapter 2. Kalyma   Yukaghir and its speakers          c. hodi         numg-gin
             go:IMP      house-DAT
             ‘Go home!’ [F36]
None of the Russian items involved in these utterances can be
viewed as integrated into Yukaghir grammar and/or lexicon; these
examples are intended just to represent a possible source of contact
changes.      Yet some grammatical items of Russian origin are used
very regularly and can be assumed to have replaced their original
Yukaghir counterparts. One of the most notable examples is the
Russian intensifier sam ‘self’ (in various phonetic forms):
 (15)     a. sam el-oZa-nu-j
             self  NEG-drink-IPFV-INTR:3SG
             ‘He himself didn’t drink.’ |K4]
          b. tude-gele      kudde-m            tude-sam   aj   amde-j
             [he-Acc    kill-TR:3SG] [he-self    CP die-INTR:3SG]
             ‘He killed that one and died himself, too.’ [K3]
Cf. the Yukaghir emphatic form of personal pronouns marked by
the suffix -id’ie, e.g., tude-l ‘he’ > tud-id’ie ‘he himself’.
     In the most general terms,               the effect of Russian contact on
Kolyma Yukaghir grammar can be described as a shift from origi-
nal Yukaghir synthetic grammatical patterns to newly introduced
analytical patterns. In some cases, the new pattern involves a
grammatical item borrowed from Russian. For example, obliga-
tive modality is now expressed almost exclusively by a construc-
tion with a Russian predicative loanword nado ‘is-necessary’ and a
nominalized form of a verb (as in (16a)), which is rapidly replacing
Yukaghir modal suffixes (the old pattern is illustrated by (16b)),
e.g.:
 (16)     a. tamun       min-gi         nado
             that      take-POSS necessary
             ‘It is necessary to take it.’
          b. tamun       min-moze
             that       take-PRSP{TR:1SG)
             ‘It, is necessary /inevitable to take it, I should take it.’
                                         Kolyma   and   Tundra   Yukaghir   27Another subclass of these contact phenomena comprises various
expansions of Russian-like grammatical patterns construed by
means of Yukaghir morphology, which squeeze out’ Yukaghir syn-
thetic patterns and take over their functions. For example, Yuk-
aghir has a verbal suffix -7- designating movement in order to
perform the action denoted by the stem. This suffix can occur
cither in a finite verb form as in (17a), or in a same-subject form
dominated by a verb of movement as in (17b}. Both patterns are
being rapidly replaced by a construction with the Supine, similar
to that found in many European languages (including Russian),
eg, (17c):
(17)   a. tabud-ek   — jug-jt-mele
         this-PRED look-PURP-OF:3SG
         ‘He went to look at this.’
       b. ans t-ga-t                keure-s”
          |search-PURP-SS:IPFV] go-PFV:INTR:3S8G
          ‘He went to look for it.’
       c. ans’i-din    kewe-s’
          search-SUP go-3SG:INTR
          ‘He went to look for it.’
Although the construction with the Supine is hardly new for
Kolyma Yukaghir, it can be assumed to have been a marginal
device for expressing this situation type until recently. Now, it is
the most common and frequently applied option, while the pat-
terns represented in (17a)-(17b), having no structural parallel in
Russian, are squeezed out.
   Similar phenomena are found in almost all fragments of Yuk-
aghir grammar and will therefore be described in detail in the
respective sections of the book. In general, I will try to present
modern Kolyma Yukaghir as it is used in everyday communication
(that is, by Yukaghirs over 55-60).","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47]"
"2.2.1. The connective particle aj ~ ajz ‘too, again, still’
The particle aj is employed to link a clause to a clause referring to
a (semantically) similar situation, most often signified by the same
verb. In the simplest case, the situations linked by means of this
particle are just two occurrences of the same situation, with the
same sets of participants. In this case the particle can be glossed
as ‘again’ (if the clause describes the second occurrence of the
situation, (913), (914)) or ‘too’ (if it describes the first occurrence
(914)). The clauses involved need not be adjacent (e.g., in (913a)
two instances of the particle refer back to two different preceding
clauses). The particle takes the preverbal position:
 (913)     a. tamun-ge          tan      pulut          aj       mezze-j-delle       aj

If such clauses are adjacent, the particle can occur in both of them
(914a). Note that the linear order of the clauses can be reversed
with respect to the temporal order of the situations (914b):
 (914)   a. d’e tan      jeklie    aj   ejr-il’i            sobenn’i      aj

The same    particle can link clauses describing similar situations
with distinct sets of involved participants. The examples in (915)
illustrate the case where the situations differ in one participant
slot. In (916), the participants are rearranged with respect to
their roles in the situation. If the NP representing the changed
participant is not adjacent to the verb form, the particle normally
takes the postnominal position (916b)         (otherwise, the preverbal
and postnominal positions cannot be distinguished). If this NP
is marked as the grammatical Focus, the particle takes the pre-
nominal position (see (915d), (919a)).1°4

The variant      ajz is used   if the clause does not describe another
occurrence of a situation, but the same protracted situation (which
is thereby marked to take place still, although the time reference
has changed). The variant @j can occur in this case as well. In this
context, the particle can be glossed as ‘still’ or ‘yet’, depending on
whether the clause is positive or negative:

532      Chapter   14.   Coreference   and   discourse    coherenceIn transitive clauses, the variant aj: can mean ‘more’ (with the
scope over the O participant), in contrast with aj (which can only
mean      ‘too’ in similar contexts).                     Note that the meanings ‘still’
and ‘more’ can be distinguished by means of the linear position
of the particle, cf. (918c) and (919a). If the construction involves
quantifier floating (8.3), the particle is placed before the quantifier
(919).105

The enclitic -de ~ -te (the latter variant occurs after voiceless
consonants) establishes a rather loose and semantically nonspe-
cific link (‘and, too’) with the immediately preceding clause. It
is attached to the first word of the clause (even if it is an NP
modifier; see (920a), (920b)).

This particle can also function as a sort of contrastive marker, i.e.,
it contrasts the clause to some implied presupposition (‘even’), In
this function, this particle is attached to the constituent it focuses
(921c). It is often combined with an intensifier (921a)-(921b).

"1.4. Indefinite Pronouns
There are three types of indefinite pro-forms based on the Interrog-
atives: ordinary indefinite pronouns (1.4.1), negative quantifiers
(1.4.2) and free-choice pronouns {1.4.3} and three non-derived in-
definite pronouns, Ser ‘something’ (1.4.4) ile ‘some (of)’ (1.4.5)
and jen ‘(an)other’ (1.4.6).
                                                                 Pronouns   2511.4.1. Ordinary indefinite pro-forms
These forms are derived by means of the markers +ere                    or -de
and generally correspond to the English some series:

The Interrogative pronoun leme ~ neme can function as an in-
definite pronoun ‘something, somebody’ without any additional
marking:

the prefix n’e. The only exception is the negative pronoun nilgi
‘nobody’ (i.e., the negative counterpart of kin ‘who’), see (471c).

"2. Tense and Mood
2.1.     The Tense-Mood subparadigm
2.1.1. Structure of the paradigm
The major Tense-Mood                   forms are constituted   by means    of two
morphological oppositions (see (271)) (Krejnovich 1982:139-152):
  1. Non-Future (zero marking) vs. Future (the suffix -t/e)- } vs.
     Irrealis (the prefix et- ~ ot-)
 2. Non-Inferential (zero marking) vs. Inferential (the suffix -1’el-)
    vs. Prospective (the suffix -moZi- )The Inferential marker can be combined with Future (334) and
Irrealis (328b). Otherwise, the overt. markers listed above are in-
                                                           Tense   and Mood      167compatible.      The     Future Inferential form expresses hypothetical
meaning (see 2.6), which results in the following list of the basic
Tense-Mood forms (the 3sG forms of the verb a- ‘make’):
(320)     Unmarked           a-m
          Future             a-te-m
          Irrealis           m-et+a-m
          Inferential        a-Vel-u-m
          Prospective        a-mozi-m
          Hypothetical       a-l’el-te-m
This subparadigm as a whole is opposed to the Imperative (which
is incompatible with either of the Tense-Mood markers), see 2.8.
Besides, there are two Periphrastic Tense-Mood forms (see 2.9)
and a practically obsolete Desiderative suffix (see 2.10).
   The overt Tense-Mood markers are generally disallowed in the
non-finite verb forms, with the following significant exceptions:
 1. The    Attributive     forms    can be marked   for the Future            in the
     regular way (see 1.2).
 2. The    Conditional converbs       can contain the Inferential marker
     (see 10.3.3),
2.1.2. Formation
Basically, each Tense-Mood form is characterized by a single suffix
(or a combination of two suffixes in the case of the Hypothetical),
so there remain         only some   marginal   formation     issues to be de-
scribed:
2.1.2.1. The Future marker has two variants,               -fe- and -t-.       This
alternation is described in 3.3.4.1.1.
2.1.2.2. The Irrealis marker is usually preceded by the Affirmative
prefix, the output being m-et-. Otherwise, it is often pronounced
as ot-.","[186, 187]"
"2.3.3. Relativization and complementation
Relative clauses are built by means of the Attributive verb forms,
the Action Nominal, and, far less frequently, by the Result Nomi-
nal. The syntactic roles accessible for relativization are the subject
(11a), the direct object (11b), the spatial or temporal adverbial
(11c), aud the Possessor of the intransitive subject (11d).

 8.1. Purpose
The history of Yukaghir studies features the names of two bril-
Hant researchers, Woldemar Jochelson and Eruhim Krejnovich,
who have provided the basic grammatical descriptions of the Yuk-
aghir languages (Jochelson 1898; 1900; 1905; Krejnovich 1955;
1958; 1968; 1979; 1982). The Kolyma Yukaghir language has been
briefly described by Jochelson (1905) and Krejnovich (1979); the
former source          (which is apparently              best known   to the English-
reading audience) is based on the rich data collected by Jochelson
at the end of the XIX“ century (1898; 1900}. Krejnovich’s es-
say in Encyclopedia of the languages of Asia and Africa (1979)
is based both on Jochelson’s materials and on Krejnovich’s own
                                                 About this grammer   13data collected in 1959. Finally, Krejnovich’s last work (1982) rep-
resents the most detailed and comprehensive source of information
on arange of significant issues for both Yukaghir languages. These
works constitute the major sources of first-hand data on Kolyma
Yukaghir,’ which have served as the basis for a number of papers
dealing with some specific topics, as well as for typological studies
involving Yukaghir data. A detailed description of Kolyma Yuk-
aghir phonology based on new field data constitutes a part of Irina
Nikolaeva’s unpublished Ph.D. thesis (1988b).
   Thus, there is no book which might serve as a reference gram-
mar of Kolyma Yukaghir. Further, some important aspects of the
language have not been described at all. This grammar is intended
to fill that gap, drawing both on the previous descriptions of Yuk-
aghir and on the results of my own field work, and thus to make
Kolyma Yukaghir data available for further studies, as well as for
cross-linguistic research.”
    The grarmmar attempts to cover all attested forms and con-
structions of contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir; in this restricted
sense, it is intended to be comprehensive. It is clear, however,
that no single book can provide a truly “comprehensive” descrip-
tion of any human language, at least not at the present stage of
development of linguistics. Writing a grammar inevitably involves
making a number of choices, so that some aspects of the language
structure may be described and exemplified in more detail, others
only briefly sketched, and possibly some may be omitted from the
description. Insofar as such decisions have been made consciously,
I have attempted to write this grammar in such a way as to “let
the language speak”, rather than to force it to answer any par-
ticular theoretically pre-determined questions. In other words, I
have tried to concentrate on those constructions and grammatical
distinctions that, appear to be of importance in Yukaghir gram-
mar and discourse, rather than on those that play a major role in
current linguistic theories.
14   Chapter   t. Introduction 3.2. The structure of the grammar
This grammar has a rather traditional structure:      it comprises a
sociolinguistic introduction (Chapter 2), Phonology (Chapter 3),
Morphology (Chapters 4-7), Syntax (Chapters 8-14), and Texts
(Appendix 3). The lexicon is represented by two Appendices: a
Yukaghir-English vocabulary (Appendix 1) and an exemplified list
of nonproductive verbal derivational suffixes (Appendix 2}. The
Morphology is divided into chapters according to the classification
into parts of speech, which is introduced in Chapter 4. The further
structuring of each chapter is essentially determined by two kinds
of considerations, which can be called paradigmatic and semantic:
    Whenever some morphological items clearly constitute a para-
digm, they are treated as such. Normally, I start a description of a
paradigm with a listing of opposed items and their form(s), which
is followed by a semantic (functional) description of cach particular
item. If it appcars that some morpheme can be more appropri-
ately described separately, not as a member of any paradigmatic
opposition (this is the case for some derivational morphemes), its
form and meaning are treated together. In both cases, I take the
form-to-function approach, that is, I describe the meaning(s) (or
function(s)) of grammatical items singled out on formal grounds.
These considerations determine the “micro-structure” of the mor-
phological description.
    On the other hand, the “macro-structure” of each chapter fol-
lows the function-to-form approach, that is, it features such gen-
eral semantic categories as, e.g., “Aspect” or “Demonstrative pro-
noun”, under which various paradigms or separate morphological
items are subsumed on functional grounds. In practice, this means
that considerations of semantic affinity prevail over distinctions in
the grammatical status, in particular, over the opposition between
inflection and derivation. For instance, the section on Aspect deals
with all morphological means employed for expressing aspectual
meanings, regardless of their regularity, productivity, and the like.
This is not to say, of course, that such properties are not expli-
cated for cach item. Normally, each section starts with a general
overview of the morphological means it describes, their (formal
                                                  About this grammar   = 15and semantic) relations to each other, grammatical status, etc.
   The Syntaz is structured according to similar considerations.
It is divided into seven chapters associated with more or less tra-
ditional topics in syntax, as determined by general classification
of syntactic units and types of syntactic relations. The internal
structure of each chapter is determined by grammatical distinc-
tions expressed   in Yukaghir,   that is, the constructions are classi-
fied according to functional considerations, which helps to high-
light the contrasting features of functionally similar constructions.
On the micro-level, the description of each construction takes the
form-to-function approach: my aim is to describe and exemplify
various constructions and the meaning(s) associated with these
constructions.
    I believe that this combination of the form-to-function approach
to the description proper and the function-to-form approach to
classification of items into chapters and sections of a grammar
appropriately suits the objectives of this endeavor: on the one
hand, it provides a reasonable degree of accessibility of informa-
tion on the basis of rather general and semantically motivated
headings determined by the more or less widely assumed view
on what a descriptive grammar should cover; on the other hand,
on the micro-level it licenses a description of grammatical items
and associated semantic configurations, as they are attested in the
specific language, rather than mapping of linguistic constructs and
concepts onto that language.
    To be sure, at a number of points these approaches turn out to
be in contradiction, i.e., the range of functions associated with a
morphological item or syntactic construction crosses the “bound-
aries” set. by the general semantic considerations. There is no one
way to solve the descriptive problems produced by such contra-
dictions that can be applied throughout the grammar. However,
there are two technical devices which are intended to override
these contradictions: cross-references between the relevant frag-
ments of fhe grammar and special sections providing summaries
of interrelated phenomena treated in different parts of the gram-
mar (c.g., there is a summary of properties which identify the
16   Chapter   1. Introductionsyntactic function of subject in Yukaghir; since these properties
manifest themselves in various types of syntactic constructions,
they are described in detail in different sections of the grammar).
To sum up, the macro-structure of the description offered here
is determined by how I understand what descriptive linguistics
is about; in many respects, it follows such general guidelines for
descriptive linguists as Lingua Descriptive Questionnaire (Comrie
and Smith 1977} and Language Typology and Syntactic Descrip-
tion (Shopen 1985). The micro-structure is determined by what I
know of Kolyma Yukaghir and represents an attempt to describe
the language “in its own terms”.","[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
" 1.2. Proprietive clauses
1.2.1. Semantics of the Proprietive clauses
A nominal predicate can be represented by an NP in the Propri-
etive form (5.5.5.1). In this construction, the Proprietive predicate
introduces an entity which is associated with the entity represented
by the subject as a possession (774), a part (775), a relative (776),
or something located in the place (777). The latter pattern can
be used with general] existential meaning, with unspecified subject
(778).

Nominative NP representing the subject of a Proprietive clause
can be replaced by a Locative NP with the same semantic inter-
pretation. Note that such constructions are not confined to the
locative use of the pattern (cf. {777))

The Locative NP in this construction controls the Plural marker on
the Proprietive form (which is normally controlled by the subject);
this construction does not occur with the first or second person
448      Chapter 12.   Nominal predicates   and grammatical   FocusLocative.
      This construction can be viewed as a sort of mixing of the
Proprietive pattern and the existential pattern with a spatial ad-
verbial, which can be employed to express similar meanings:?!

1.3.1. Transformative clauses
A transformative clause links a referential entity and a description
of its state obtained as a result of some process. The referential
entity may be represented as the 5 participant (1.3.1.1) or the O
participant (1.3.1.2).
1.3.1.1. Intransitive transformative clauses are formed by means
of the verb kude- ‘become’; the slot for the description of the
resulting state of the subject referent is filled by an NP in the
Transformative form (783) (5.5.5.3) or, less often, by an adverb
(784):

(785), or with the verb a- ‘make’ (786).

1.3.2.     Privative clauses
Privative clauses follow the same distribution pattern as the Trans-
formative clauses: they describe a resulting state of the S partici-
pant (1.3.2.1) or the O participant (1.3.2.2). This state is described
as absence of some associated entity and is normally expressed by
means of the Privative form of a noun (5.5.2).
1.3.2.1.      Intransitive       Privative      clauses   are constructed   with   the
copula kude- ‘become’ or the verb pon’o- ‘remain’:

               ‘So, the prince of the Koryaks was left without (his)

               ‘We are left without animals.’ {F9]
In some examples, there is no postnominal Privative marker, and
the same meaning is rendered just by means of the negative prefix
attached to a bare noun stem:
 (788)      a, met     kende-l-ge                 el+anil         kude-je

2.1. Introductory remarks
This grammar treats the grammatical Focus as a constituent of
the finite clause, i.e., the Focus is considered as a clause-internal
syntactic phenomenon         (9.1.1).   This analysis is motivated by a
number of considerations which are summarized in 2.2.
   On the other hand, the morphology employed for Focus mark-
ing shows its obvious formal similarity to cleft and cleft-like con-
structions in other languages:   e An NP receives Predicative marking, which is also employed
     for nominal predicates (see 9.1.1 and 1.1.1).
   e The finite verb form is deranked by the same formal means
         that are applied for relativization (see 9.1.1 and 11.3.1).
It might therefore be suggested that the Focus construction should
be analyzed as a combination of a clause-external constituent and
a free relative clause. Furthermore, there are two types of con-
structions which apparently favor the clause-external analysis of
the grammatical Focus (2.3-2.4).
   This combination of properties indicates that the Focus con-
struction is a result of grammaticalization of a cleft-like structure,
a typologically quite frequent source for Focus constructions.
452     Chapter   12.   Nominal   predicates   and grammatical   Focus2.2. Focus as a clause-internal phenomenon:                              summary
The grammatical Focus in Yukaghir exhibits a number of syntactic
features which identify it as a clause-internal phenomenon:
      « The word order in the Focus construction not only maintains
        the regularities attested in other clause types, but even ad-
        heres to them more strictly, that is to say, the Focus NP is not
        split off from the remainder of the clause. In particular, the
        A constituent cannot intervene between the Focus and the
        verb form (see 9.1.5.1). This linearization rule can be viewed
        as grammaticalization of the information-packaging function
        of Focus marking, which implies that the presupposed mate-
        rial (in particular, the topic) should precede the Focus (see
        Section 3). On the other hand, it is in obvious contradic-
        tion with a cleft-like analysis, which would suggest that the
        A constituent belongs to a free relative clause.
      e The   accessibility constraints                on Focus          marking   are much
        stronger        than   those on relativization;              in particular,   the A
        constituent is accessible for relativization (11.3.1.1), but not
        for the Focus marking (9.1.1.1). The Focus marking is orga-
        nized in such a way as to ensure the unique identification of
        the clause-internal role of the NP: it can be applied only to
        one participant role per clause type.
      e The Focus S constituent maintains the syntactic properties
        associated with the subjects (9.1.4.1, 2.4}.
      e The SF and OF forms of the verb, in contrast with the simi-
        lar forms used for relativization, have the full range of finite
        morphology (see 6.1.2.1, 6.1.3.2).
These properties suggest that the Focus in Yukaghir is grammati-
calized as a clause-internal phenomenon: the strong syntactic con-
straints on Focus marking are not motivated by the constraints on
relativization, nor by the Focus semantics per se. Rather, they
are targeted at integrating the Focus into the clause-internal syn-
tax, so that the Focus marking unambiguously assigns the NP to
a clause-internal function (participant role).
                                              Syntaz of the Focus construction   4532.3.     Cleft-like constructions
The Focus construction may contain, although rather infrequently,
a demonstrative pronoun in the Nominative form which is not as-
signed to any clause-internal function and can be analyzed only
as the subject associated with the Predicative NP according to
the descriptive pattern (1.1.1).           Consequently, the remainder of
the construction should be analyzed as a free relative clause. The
sentence in (790a} illustrates the OF construction with a demon-
strative pronoun, (790b), the SF construction.
 (790)     a. jug-k            adugn. tei-ek       anci-yile
              see-IMP:28G | this        you-PRED search-3PL:OF
              ‘Look, it is you that they are looking for.’ [K5]
           b. adugn    aleksej-die     CunZe-l
              this       A.-DIM      whistle-SF
              ‘It is Aleksej that is whistling.’
It should be stressed that the demonstrative pronoun in such a
construction is not a “dummy subject”, i.e., it always refers to
some actual phenomenon in the situation of speech. In (790),
the demonstrative refers to a situation taking place at the time
of speech (calling somebody in (790a), whistling in (790b)). In
(791), the demonstrative has an entity referent (a dog found by
the speaker and his mother).
 (791)        emie,    tugn    Soromo-lek            touke+yot
              mother   that    person-PRED          [dog-TRNSF
              kude-delle            ejrie-lel-u-l
              become-Ss:PFV|        come-INFR-0-SF
              ‘Mother, this one has turned out to be a human being
              which has transformed into a dog.’ [F20]
However, other types of NPs are impossible in this position (e.g.,
in (791), the demonstrative pronoun cannot be replaced by an NP
like ‘that dog’),
   The construction observes all constraints on the Focus con-
struction outlined in 2.2: Predicative marking can be applied only
to the S/O participant; the A constituent cannot take the linear
454      Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusposition between         the Focus and the verb form,            i.e., it is either
postposed       (792a) or precedes the Focus (thus taking the posi-
tion between the demonstrative pronoun and the Predicative NP,
(792b)).
 (792)     a. tugn     lem-dik         uj-met             tit?
               that what-PRED make-OF:2PL                 you
               ‘What is it that you are doing?’
           b. adugn tet cidetke-lek jug-l’el-me
              this     you C-PRED       see-INFR-OF:2SG
              ‘It is Chechetka that you have seen.’
However, this construction gives a piece of syntactic evidence in fa-
vor of the clause-external origin of the grammatical Focus, insofar
as the demonstrative pronouns manifest the presence of the sub-
ject slot (which can be attributed to the main clause with nominal
predicate, but cannot. be accounted for under the clause-internal
analysis of the Focus).
   On the other hand, this construction could have become possi-
ble under the influence of Russian, where the demonstrative pro-
noun eto ‘it, this’ is regularly used to highlight the focus; in partic-
ular, this pronoun appears in the Russian translations of the sen-
tences like (791)-(792) provided by the Yukaghir narrators. Thus,
such sentences appear to combine the Yukaghir and the Russian
tools for focus marking. Notably, such examples have not been
attested in previous descriptions of the Yukaghir Focus (which are
based on earlier data), which can be taken as a piece of indirect
evidence in favor of this hypothesis.","[464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474]"
"3.2.2.     Thetic clauses
SF marking is employed in order to impose the so-called thetic,
or presentational, articulation (Kuroda 1972, Sasse 1987), that
is, to present a state of affairs (an event together with the enti-
ties involved in this event} as a unitary whole, without analysis
into two “packaging” units corresponding to the notions of sub-
ject (topic) and predicate (comment).                Roughly, these are clauses
which can serve as appropriate answers to questions like ‘What
has happened?’. Thetic clauses signal some sort of discourse dis-
continuity, Le., the event described by a thetic clause does not
belong to any coherent chain of actions (Krejnovich 1982:214).

3.2.3. Delimiting function of the OF marking
A broad scope of assertion including a non-contrastive O con-
stituent allows both packaging options. The Focus variant seems
to be applied in order to contrast the assertion rendered by the
given clause and the previously introduced information, so that the
Focus NP identifies the left “boundary” of the assertion. If there is
no pragmatically motivated boundary immediately before the O
466      Chapter   12.   Nominal   predicates   and grammatical   Focusconstituent, the neutral variant is likely to be chosen. This strat-
egy of information structuring works both on the clause-internal
(3.2.3.1) and on the interclausal levels (3.2.3.2).
3.2.3.1.     Clause-internal structuring.                    If a clause contains 4 nom-
inal A constituent, two alternative information structures can be
distinguished: First, the clause can be constructed as providing
information about the A participant (that is, the A constituent is
taken to be the topic of that clause and excluded from the scope
of assertion). Secondly, the event can be presented as a unitary
whole and opposed to the previously introduced information.
   The first type of information structure is encoded by means of
the Focus packaging option (802). For instance, the second clause
in (802a) is intended to provide the relevant information about the
cuckoo (it was sent to call other birds, because it was a polyglot),
hence the Focus packaging variant.
 (802)     a. tamun-pe-gele              edie-s’-tin              kukki-k
              [that-PL-ACC                call-ITER-SUP]          {cuckoo-PRED

               send-IPFV-3PL:0F}                  | cuckoo        {eighteen      bird

               language-PRED know-OF:3SG}
               ‘In order to call these, they sent the cuckoo. The
               cuckoo knew eighteen bird languages.’ [F5]

               get.caught-CAUS:ITER-OF:38G}
               ‘The rich person was fishing ...’ [F46]
The second type of information structure is likely to occur if the
(transitive) event as a whole is opposed to some background in-
formation. A characteristic environment is the context of a con-
ditional construction (803), where the main clause as a whole is
opposed to the conditional setting (roughly, it can be conceived
of as an answer to a question like ‘What will happen if...’). In
this situation, the most significant information-structuring bound-

than between the A constituent and the O constituent of the main
clause (as would have been implied by Focus marking), hence the
neutral packaging option:*?

               ‘If you see that my coat is not fastened there, this will
               mean that I have killed this prince.’ [F50]
The     same    mechanism          can     be applied            to exclude     other   (non-
primary)       clause-initial constituents from the scope of assertion,
as illustrated by (804) and by the first clause in (802a).

initial, the same distinction operates on the interclausal level. The
neutral packaging option construes the main clause as a part of
a coherent information flow (805), while the Focus variant signals
some sort of discourse discontinuity between the Focus-marking
clause and the preceding one, i.e., the event is presented as un-
expected (806a) and/or implies a sort of semantic contrast to the
preceding material (806b).

3.2.4.   Pronominal          Focus
Focus marking must be applied to signal that a pronominal $/O
constituent is included in the scope of assertion. This marking is
needed to override the “default” topic interpretation of a pronoun
(which is implied by the neutral packaging variant). For example,
the second clause in (807a) is intended to provide further infor-
mation about some bird (the dropped subject of the first clause);
yet, if not for the Focus marking, it would have been interpreted as
providing information about the man (referred to by the demon-
strative pronoun). Similarly, both clauses in (807a) are meant
to explain why the speaker and his companions have come, not to
provide information about the referent of the pronoun (the son-in-
law), hence, the Focus marking of the highly accessible pronominal
referent in the second clause.

470      Chapter    12.   Naminal    predicates   and grammatical     FocusThus, Focus marking treats pronominal O constituents in the same
way as S constituents (3.2.2), that is, it is applied to signify inclu-
sion in the scope of assertion, independently of the factors outlined
in 3.2.3 for non-pronominal O constituents. The examples in (808)
show that the OF marking of a pronoun does not imply any sort

The functional               account        of SF marking presented                     in 3.2.2 im-
plies that the existential semantics should obligatorily involve
this marking. This is indeed the case for text-internal existen-
tial clauses (809) and for text-initial existential clauses containing
clause-initial adverbials (810).

On the other hand, text-initial existential clauses without clause-
initial adverbials normally take the neutral form. The examples
in (811) illustrate the typical structure of the beginning of a nar-
rative: (811)    a. pulun-die     l’e-9          terike-n’-t.

Thus, SF marking is applied only if there is some preceding ma-
terial; otherwise, the neutral variant is chosen even for existential
clauses, where the S constituent is “by definition” included in the
scope of assertion. This evidence seems to indicate that SF mark-
ing serves the same delimiting function as described in 3.2.3 for OF
marking. If there is nothing to be delimited from (or contrasted
to), as in (811), this packaging option is not applied.
Chapter          13
Sentence types and negation
This chapter deals with grammatical manifestation of illocutionary
distinctions (Sections 1-3) and negation (Section 4). Yukaghir
distinguishes Declarative sentences (which are not discussed as
such), Imperative sentences (Section 1), polar (2.1) and question-
word questions (2.2), and two minor types: Exclamations (3.1)
and Optative sentences (3.2).
    The verb forms used in major sentence types are described in
6.1.1; this chapter is concerned with syntactic properties associ-
ated with distinct types, in particular, their characteristic particles
(2.1.2, 2.1.3, 3.2).
    Section 5 describes the syntactic strategies of reporting the con-
tents of a speech act, including the attested peripheral uses of these
strategies.","[484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493]"
"5.2.     The Privative form
The Privative form (‘without X’) is built by the combination of
the prepositional negative marker el-/- and the postpositional mor-
pheme +éugn:

"
4.1.1. The Different-Subject Anterior clause
A different-subject situation prior to the superordinate clause sit-
uation is expressed by the combination of the Result Nominal
clause and the Ablative form of the postposition jola ‘after’, jola-t
~ jela-t (see 7.3.2.1).

A situation posterior to the superordinate clause situation is ex-
pressed by the combination of the postposition kieje ‘before’ and
the Action Nominal clause; the construction is not marked for
switch reference,cf. (752a) and (752b).

The Action Nominal in this construction can be negated, yet with-
out the expected semantic change: the construction as a whole
preserves approximately the same meaning; see (753). However,
430      Chapter it.   Subordinationwhile the affirmative variant just establishes a temporal relation
between the situations, the negative variant is used to signify a
causal relation between the adverbial clause situation and the
termination of the superordinate clause situation. For instance,
(753b) is intended to stress that the existence of the Soviets en-
tailed the disappearance of the priests.

The situation which determines the temporal endpoint of the su-
perordinate clause situation can be expressed by the Action Nom-
inal clause with the directional postposition layi ~ lanide (see
7.3.2.3):

Causal adverbial clauses are built as Result Nominal clauses in the
Prolative (756a)-(756b) or the Ablative (756c) case form (i.e., in
432      Chapter 11. Subordinationthe same case forms that are used for other causal adjuncts; see
9.3.1.2). This construction is used if the situations related have
different primary participants:*’

The Purpose adverbial clause is formed by means of the Supine
form (see 6.1.3.3).            The subject of the Supine clause is taken to
be referentially        identical with           the subject      of the superordinate
clause (757), with its direct (758a)} or indirect (758b)-(758c) ob-
ject, or with the Dative Experiencer (758d). The NP controlling
the Supine subject always precedes the Supine clause. The subject
cannot be expressed overtly in the Supine clause.

In (758), the primary participant of the Supine situation is repre-
sented by @; in the interlinear gloss; the controller in the super-
ordinate clause is indicated by the subscript 7 in the interlinear
gloss. Note that the Plural marker in the Supine form indicates
the plurality of the primary participant, (758c).

The comparative postposition tite (see 7.3.3) can take the Action
Nominal clause as its argument:
 (759)     a. n’e+jug-t                      ejre-l         tite    omo-s’on

               ‘He lives there as he used to.’ [F31]
This postposition can also govern a headless relative clause (see
3.3), the result being a comparative clause with the meaning ‘as
if’:

Nominal predicates and grammatical
Focus
1. Clauses with nominal predicates
1.1. Descriptive clauses
A descriptive clause links two NPs which serve as alternative de-
scriptions of the same entity, one of which is referential (the sub-
ject), the other, predicative. Two alternative clause patterns are
used to express such a link, the copular pattern with the copula o-
(1.1.2) and the pattern with an NP in the Predicative form (1.1.1).
There seems to be no formal distinction between identification and
classification (characterization) clauses.
   The predicative slot of a descriptive pattern can be occupied
by a headless relative clause (1.1.3) or by a Result Nominal clause
(1.1.4).","[448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457]"
"1.1.1. Clauses with nominal predicates in the Predicative form
The nominal predicate in the Predicative case occurs only with the
third-person subject (761); otherwise, the copular pattern must be
used (see 1.1.2):
(761)   a. éomolben    lebie-n-+end’od-ek
           elk         earth-ATTR+animal-PRED
           ‘The elk is a land animal.’ [F34]
        b. momusa     lagidis’e   Cisté      cumu   amun-ek
           M.         tail        entirely   all    bone-PRED
           ‘The whole tail of Momusha is only bones.’ [F6]
438      Chapter 12.   Nominal predicates       and grammatical     Focus            c. titt-in            éumu         tudel   id’>       pugil’-ek
               they-DAT           all          he      now        lord-PRED
               ‘To all of them, he is now the lord.’ [F9]
             . tig   =margil’ met emd’e
               this girl       my younger.sibling
               ‘This girl is my younger sister.’
The subject of a descriptive clause can be easily omitted, so that
a clause is made up of a single NP in the Predicative case:
 (762)     a. irk-in              Soromo         ejre-j                     joba

             . taskan      lahet     erpeje-p-lek                 Pe-Vel-ni-l

               ‘Near Taskan there were Evens. (These were) two
               families of Evens.’ |F55]
1.1.2. Copular descriptive clauses
The copular pattern is the only option if the subject of a descrip-
tive clause is first or second person:
                                          Clauses with nominal predicates   439(763)   a. met     vasilej-die o-d’e

           ‘My name is Basil.’

        d, tet     inl%-s’e           jowle-l        —o-d’ek
           you     be.terrible-ATTR   be.ill/-ANR    COP-INTR:28G
           ‘You are a terrible disease!’ [F47]
The bound copula form -/ 76- can also be used in this construction,
although such examples are less common; see (764). Somewhat
unexpectedly, the bound variant, in contrast to the free variant,
allows Plural and Possessive marking on the noun:*®
(764)   a. mit     kereke-pul+no-dili
           we      Koryak-PL+COP-INTR:1PL
           ‘We are the Koryaks (you are looking for).’ [F50|
        b. met     alandin   ujs’t-gi+no-d’e
           I       A.        worker-POSS+COP-INTR:1SG
           ‘Tam Alandin’s worker.’ [F50]
        c. kin +n0-k?

           ‘Who are you?’ [F50]

           ‘You turned out to be a bad son-in-law.’ [F18]
With the third-person subject, the copular pattern is used if some
modal meaning has to be expressed (765), in non-finite descriptive
clauses (766) and in negative clauses (767a):
440      Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focus (765) a. tamun             meme        abut               o-l’el

The negative prefix is attached to the free copula (767a)-{767b)
or to the noun followed by the bound copula (767c) (Krejnovich
1982:193-194)):

The copula o- has the transitive counterpart o-Z-, which has a
slot for Nominative NP that qualifies the O participant from the
point of view of the A participant:

1.1.3. Headless relative clauses as nominal predicates
Headless relative clauses (see 17.3.3} can be used as nominal pred-
icates, both with the copula o- (770) and in the Predicative form
(771)-(772). In this construction, the subject of a descriptive
clause is identified with (or described as) the relativized partic-
ipant.
    If the relativized participant is the subject, the subject of the
matrix clause is identified with the subject of the relative clause.
Thus, the whole construction has a single subject NP which is de-
442      Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusscribed as the primary participant of the relative clause situation.
The resulting structure is similar to that of a simple clause, the
only difference being the “complex” form of the verb; see (770)-
(771).     As described in 6.2.9.2.2, such constructions function as
the Periphrastic Past. Note that in such a construction the neg-
ative marker is attached to the lexical verb, not to the copula
(771b)-(771c).

               flood    before we-ABL go-PFV:SBNR-PL-PRED
               “They had gone away from me before the flood.’
If the relativized participant is the direct object, the subject of the
matrix clause is identified with the O participant of the relative
clause situation. Thus, the O participant is represented by the
subject NP (this constituent is shown in boldface in (772)). This
structure clearly distinguishes such constructions from their simple
                                                       Clauses   with nominal predicates   443transitive counterparts:

            make-3PL:ATTR-RELNR-PRED|
            ‘This is a thing the rich did in order to deceive
            people.’
However, the substantivized Passive Attributive forms (such as
those in (772)) can be also involved in the Periphrastic past forms,
which entails reanalysis of the construction as a simple clause,
hence, the Accusative marking of the O constituent (see examples
in 6.2.9.2.2).891.1.4. Result Nominal clauses as nominal predicates
The Result Nominal clause (6.1.3.4) can function as a nominal
predicate of a descriptive clause. This construction describes some
observed state of affairs as a result of a prior situation. The subject
of such a descriptive clause is either represented by the pronoun
tabun or dropped.

            ‘It was Koje who walked and danced there in his
            shoes.’ (lit. ‘That is the result of Koje having walked
444      Chapter    12.   Nominal predicates      and grammatical   Focus               and danced in his shoes.’) [F8]

               ‘It was my father who had sent me...’ (lit. ‘(My being
               here) is a result of my father s having sent me.’) [F22]
This construction can be employed to signify that the primary
participant of the Result Nominal situation is a part of the asser-
tion; see, e.g., (773c)-(773d).% This use is motivated by the fact
that the A participant constitutes an element of the preceding sit-
uation, but not of the resulting state. For example, the sentence
in (773d) is intended to explain why the speaker is in some place
(the resulting state of affairs which does not involve the cause),
and this explanation invokes a preceding transitive situation with
its A participant.","[457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464]"
"6.    Nominal         derivation
 6.1. Derivational suffices
6.1.1. The Diminutive
The Diminutive is derived by means of the suffix -die- (/d/ alter-
nates with /t/ after obstruents, as described in 3.3.2.1); the final
/t/, /V/ of a stem are dropped before the Diminutive marker (cf.
1.4); the final {£} of a stem alternates with /te/, /a/ according
to the rules described in 8.3.4.3.2):
(249)      SojVbul       =>     sajVbu-die          ‘little mouse’
           Sal           >      sa-die              ‘little tree, stick’
           Sagale        =>     §aqala-die          ‘little fox’
           terike        >      terikre-die         ‘(little) old woman’
                                                           Nominal   derivation      129A noteworthy          distributional feature of the Diminutive is that it
follows the Plural marker when combined                within one word form:(250)     pulut-pe-die      ‘(little) old men’
          terike-p-tie      ‘(little) old women’
          ugrpe-p-tie       ‘(little) children’
In many     cases, the Diminutive         seems    to have rather affectionate
meaning. in order to stress the meaning ‘little’, the Diminutive
form can be combined with the Attributive form of the verb juko-
‘be little’.
 (251)       juko-d’e         gorobo-die-lek        tadi-yile
             small-ATTR       cow-DIM-PRED          give-3PL:OF
             ‘They gave him a tiny cow.’ [F27]
Another way to stress a very small quantity or size is to apply the
Diminutive suffix to a nominal form of this verb.
 (252)       éul-e            guko-d’on-ben-die-lek                  pan-mele
             meat-INSTR       small-SBNR-RNR-DIM-PRED                cook-OF:3SG
             ‘She cooked a very small piece of meat.’ [F51]
In a few cases, the Diminutive entails singulative meaning:
(253)    ul’egera-die       ‘straw’
         straws-DIM
         cul-die            ‘a little piece of meat’
         meat-DIMWhen applied to the negative form of the indefinite pronoun leme,
n’e-leme ‘nothing’, the Diminutive suffix has an emphatic impact
(like ‘not even a bit’).
(254)       n'e-leme-die              el-+-lejda-je        Soromo-pul         tite
            [[NEG-what-DIM            NEG-know-ATTR]       person-PL          as

            ‘Like people who do not know even a bit (about how
            to hunt), we have come just having spent some time
            here and there (without any success).’
130     Chapter 5. Nominal morphology
Finally, the Diminutive suffix is often used in combination with
recent borrowings from Russian, having no function but to make
a word more Yukaghir-like,              e.g., Juka-die ‘pike’ (from Russian
shchuka ‘pike’), ajka-die ‘sea gull’ (from Russian chajka ‘sea
gull’). In particular, this device is commonly applied to Russian
first names, e.g., Aleks’ej-die, Egor-die, Miqajla-die (in each word,
the first component is just a Russian male name).","[148, 149, 150]"
" 1.2.    Verbal paradigm
The verb paradigm falls into several sub-paradigms:                     finite forms,
Attributive forms, Nominal forms, and Converbs (non-finite
switch-reference forms). The finite non-imperative inflection com-
prises polarity markers, tense/mood markers, and agreement
markers, ordered as shown by the following scheme:(103) Finite non-imperative inflection:

The Imperative sub-paradigm is organized according to the scheme
in (4-5):(105) Imperative inflection:             NEG+V-PL-IMP /PROH-PERSON
This scheme is illustrated by the following examples:

"2.2. Morphology
Yukaghir is a highly synthetic and essentially agglutinative lan-
guage; suffixation prevails. There are five prefixes (two prefixes
of polarity, the reflexive, the reciprocal, and the prefix of irrealis);
these morphemes are characterized by a looser connection with
the stem than the suffixes, so that the boundary between a prefix
and its stem may be described as internal open juncture. Fusion
phenomena at morphemic boundaries are marginal.
    The major open classes of lexical items are nouns and verbs;
they can be easily distinguished by morphological criteria. Words
denoting qualities constitute a sub-class of verbs; in the attributive
function, they take the verbal Attributive form (see (5)).",[23]
"3.4.2.    Functions
The Habitual signifies a usual, recurrent situation in the past or
in the present:

            ‘He used to bring back a huge catch, when he returned
            (from hunting).’
Unlike the Imperfective in the generic/habitual function (3.2.3),
the Habitual form can be used to express a situation characteristic
of the past only (in contrast to the present):

            ‘We uscd to live that way long ago.’ [K1]
It may also express a situation characteristic of the present in con-
trast to the past (see (376a), (379b}), For example, the following
sequence of sentences occurs at the end of a text describing how
Yukaghirs used to leave useless parts of killed animals in the for-
est without taking care of them and how terrible the consequences
used to be. As a result, now:

The final vowel is also omitted when the Ingressive is preceded by
an Iterative suffix, see (383).","[218, 219, 220, 221]"
"1.4.3. Free-choice indefinite pronouns
Finally, there is a Russian-like means to derive free-choice indef-
inite pronouns, namely, the morpheme kos ~ kug (from Russian
hot’ ‘at least, if only’) can be prefixed to an Interrogative pronoun,
possibly in combination either with the negative prefix or with the
marker of indefiniteness:

"1.1.2.    Distribution of the Finite forms
The finite forms are used in one-clause (simple) sentences and
in main clauses within multiclausal sentences. The finite forms
are distributed over two interdependent functional parameters, the
illocutionary sentence type and the grammatical Focus.      On the
142      Chapter 6.   Verb morphology
one hand, neither the Imperative nor the Interrogative forms can
enter the grammatical Focus construction. On the other hand,
with respect to the Focus semantics (see 12.3), the Imperative
forms are similar to the Main forms, inasmuch as both can serve
as the single element within the scope of the illocutive operator
(narrow focus}. This property is manifested by the capability of
being the only overt element of a main clause:
 (273)     a. tabun       qon-te-l-ben-pe                kel-delle

               ‘They shot and killed a bear. (They) skinned

              RECP-take-PL-IMP-2
               ‘Let them marry!’ (lit. ‘take each other’) [K1]
This is impossible for the Focus-indicating and Interrogative
forms. The SF forms and the OF forms are used only in the
nominal Focus constructions (Krejnovich 1982:204-216), that. is,
they constitute a finite clause only in combination with a noun
phrase in the Predicative form.”

In particular,    the Focus      construction         (hence,   the SF     or the OF
form) is the only option in questions with an Interrogative pronoun
in the intransitive subject function or in the direct object function
(Krejnovich 1982:232-234), i.c., whenever a constituent                         able to
trigger the grammatical Focus marking is questioned.

           what-PRED          bring-OF:28G
           ‘What have you brought?’ [F33]
Similarly, the Interrogative forms are used only in the context of a
non-Focus question word (277). General (yes/no) questions allow
only the Indicative forms (278a); the Indicative form is also an
option in specific questions           (278b).   Thus, an Interrogative form
(exactly like a Focus-indicating form) cannot constitute the narrow
focus of an interrogative clause.

"0.2.1. Finite indirect questions
Finite indirect questions are identical in form to direct question-
word questions; they are used as a complementation strategy with
speech act verbs (880), with verbs and expressions of cognition
506      Chapter    13.   Sentence   types and    negation(881), or with clauses signifying searching or finding out (882).
Most often, the indirect question takes the sentence-final position,
yet it can be sentence-initial as well (882b).
    Note that. the first-person form of the Interrogative verb can
signal either the coreference of the primary participant with the
speaker (880a) or its coreference with the subject of the matrix
clause (881b). The latter option is worth noting, given that the
indirect question cannot be viewed as a quotation.

The indirect question construction can be used to create adverbial
(5.3) and relative (5.3.2) clauses. In this case, the question word
serves as the subordinator, with a demonstrative pro-form of the
ta-series serving as the correlate in the main clause. This pattern
constitute a marginal alternative to subordination by means of
verb morphology (see Chapter 11) and appears to be due to the
Russian influence.","[525, 526, 527, 528]"
"2.2.1.   Nouns
Nouns are inflected for number (Singular, Plural), case (Nomina-
tive, Predicative, Accusative, Instrumental, Dative, Locative, Ab-
lative, Prolative, and Comitative), and Possession (cross-reference
suffixes for third Person Possessor only). This paradigm is cxem-
plified in Table 2 for the noun @ée ‘domestic deer’.
    The Possessive marker cross-references either the possessive
modifier or a possessor outside the NP. Jt can be used only for
a third person Possessor that is not coreferential with the subject

of the clause; otherwise, the possessive form of a personal pronoun
is used to express the possessive relationship.
    When combined with the Possessive cross-reference marker, the
Plural may denote the number of the Possessed, the Possessor, or
both, so that a form like aée-p-ki (decr-PL-3(NOM)) is ambiguous
among ‘his/her deer (many)’, ‘their deer (one)’ and ‘their deer
(many)’.
    Nouns have an Attributive form in -d/-n which can be used
only non-referentially (e.g., aée-n legul ‘decr-food, food for deer’)
and two “verbal” forms, the Proprietive form, which is built by
means of the suffix -n’e- ~ -n- (aée-n’- ‘to have (a) deer, to be
with deer’), and the Stative form derived by the bound variant
+90- of the copulative verb o- ‘to be’ (a@ée+qo- ‘be {a) deer’).
   Nouns also have a ‘Transformative form which is derived from
the Stative form by means of the suffix -n/-t, e.g., aée+no-n ‘as
a deer, (become) a deer’, a Privative form built by the combina-
tion of the standard                negative prefix el- and the postfix +éugn,
e.g., eltace+ éugn                 ‘without (a) deer’, and an (almost obsolete)
Prospective          form,      e.g.,   pulut+mozu         ‘fiancé’   (from   pulut   ‘hus-

    There is a number of nominal derivational suffixes, only two
of which are productive, the Diminutive, -die-, e.g., aée-die ‘lit-
tle deer’ and the Augmentative, -tege- ~ -ike-, e.g., aée-tke ‘large
deer’; these suffixes follow the Possessive markers within a word
form. Nouns can also be built by compounding and by lexicaliza-

"2.2.3. Shared morphological items
A number of morphological items are shared by nouns and verbs:
they have a formally identical Privative form (‘without’), built by
the negative marker e/- and the postfix -+¢ugn, e.g., el+aée+Cugn
‘without deer’, el+a7éugn ‘without making/having made’, the
Connective       (Comitative)     foam in -n%t, e.g., aée-n’tt ‘and/with
deer’,     a-n’tt ‘and made,     while making’;     and similar Prospective
marking, cf. terike-moZu ‘fiancée (wife-to-be)’ and a-mo%i-m ‘he
is going to make’.     Besides, formally identical suffixes are employed
to express Causation (if attached to a verb stem) and Causation
of Possession {if attached to a nominal stem), cf. terike-8- ‘marry
somebody, give wife’ and a-8- ‘cause to make’. There are also some
other less transparent affinities.
8     Chapter 1. Introduction2.2.4.    Pro-forms
There are three series of demonstrative pronouns and pronomi-
nal adverbs, Proximate, Separated and Distal; Interrogative pro-
forms; a number of Indefinite pronouns; and Personal pronouns.
Demonstrative and Interrogative stems have Nominal, Attributive
and a number of Adverbial (Locative) forms; they are illustrated
in (6} for distal pro-forms.

         ta-nide    ‘thither’
         ta-t       ‘from there, thus’
Pronouns proper (that is, nominal pro-forms) have the regular
nominal paradigm, with the exception of the Possessive markers.
Personal pronouns have some additional forms: Pronominal Ac-
cusative (met-ul ‘me’), Possessive form (tude ‘her/his’), and In-
tensified form (tud-id te ‘he himself’).","[27, 28]"
"2.7. Functions of the Prospective
The Prospective signifies a situation in the future which is viewed
as a consequence of some other situation. This can be either a
prediction based on real-world knowledge (335), or a kind of moral
obligation entailed by the given situation (336). In the passage
given in (337), the Prospective form is first used to predict an
event on the basis of the changing weather; the second instance is
used to express an obligation entailed by the predicted event:

2.8. Functions of the Imperative
The Imperative has the usual range of meaning,                   c.g., command,
request, proposal, admonition, etc.
 (338)     a. tet      jagte-k              kejien

               ‘Let it burn?

           right-QLT-INTR:3SG        RECP-take-PL-IMP-3
           ‘That’s right, let them marry.’ {F3]
The second person Imperative with the suffix -ge- (see Table 14)
is used to express commands or requests which have to be fulfilled
later (Krejnovich 1982:149).
(339)   a. tet   colhoro   kuded’e      lek-telle         jagte-ge-k
           lyou hare       liver        —eat-SS:PFV]      sing-IMP-2SG
           ‘Eat some hare liver and then sing!’ [F5]
        b. éemej- delle      kel-ge-k               d’e
           {finish-Ss:PFV] come-IMP-2SG DP
           ‘Finish up and then come!’ [F36]
See also 10.2.1, 10.3.1.3 on clause chains with the Imperative finite
clause.
    The Imperative can be negated in the regular way (340c), yet
in the second person Imperative this formation normally involves
the Prohibitive suffix -le- (see Table 14).

178      Chapter   6.   Verb morphology 2.9. Periphrastic Tense-Mood Forms
2.9.1. The Periphrastic Prospective2.9.1.1. Formation. The Periphrastic Prospective form consists of
the Auxiliary /’e- ‘be’ and the Supine; the final /n/ of the Supine
can be assimilated into /l/ (see 9.3.1.3).             In some cases, just the
Dative form of the Action Nominal is used for the Periphrastic
Prospective. This form has been described by Krejnovich as the
mood of “being ready” (naklonenije gotounosti) (1982:147-149).
    The Auxiliary can be in any form, including the non-finite
forms. If the lexical verb is transitive, the agreement of the Aux-
iliary vacillates: it can follow either the Intransitive paradigm
(which reflects the intransitivity of the verb /’e- ‘be’ itself), or the
Transitive one (in accordance with the transitivity of the lexical
verb) (Krejnovich 1982:148).
2.9.1.2.     Functions.         The Periphrastic Prospective expresses rela-
tive immediate future:
 (341)     a. pon          joule+yot        kude-din       Ve-j
               state       evening-TRNSF    become-SUP     be-INTR:3SG
               ‘It was almost evening.’
           b. el+n’e+jug-din                e-lu-ge       ninie   tat
               |NEG+RECP+see-SUP            be-1/2-Ds]    mood    CA
               gude-l’el
               become-INFR(3SG)
               ‘That is how I feel when we are not going to see each
               other.’ [F57|
In most cases, the use of this form implies that some preliminary
features of the foregoing event are already present (Krejnovich
1982:148). As a result, this form can be used to refer to a process
in progress, whereby the first stage of the event has already started
(but it is not necessarily the case that it would be brought to its
completion):
 (342)     a. ley-d-ol’-i-t                       am-de-din        Ve-ni

           b. num@g-ge            jaga-din      le-de-ge        nurmng-get
              [house-LOC          reach-SUP     be-38G-Ds]     house-ABL
              jagte-lek   medu-l

              “When he was approaching the house, he heard a song
              from within.’ [F13|
Finally, this form can be used to express an intention (Krejnovich
1982:148):
(343)      a. éaréagan       d’e tet-ul          lek-tin     Ue-je
              C.             DP     you-ACC      eat-SUP     be-INTR:1SG
              ‘Charchahan, I am going to eat you.’ [F21|
           b. juku i jonza        margil’     min-din      le-mle
              small-goose girl      take-SUP be-OF:3SG
              ‘The small goose is going to marry.’ [F5]
2.9.2. The Periphrastic Past2.9.2.1.    Formation.       The Periphrastic Past is formed by putting
the Subject Nominal form {1.3.5, examples (344)) or the Relative
Nominal form (1.3.7, examples (345)) in the Predicative position.
The former construction is available for intransitive verbs only, the
latter can be used with any verb, cf. (336b) and (336c). According
to the general rules for predicate nominals (see 72.1.1, 12.1.1.3),
this construction requires the copula o- if the subject is first or
second person; if the subject is third person, the nominal can just
take the Predicative case marker.
2.9.2.2. Functions. The Periphrastic Past is used in order to con-
trast. two temporal planes, that is, to highlight that the time of
the situation being described precedes the time of reference; sec
(344a), (345a). This function is by no means grammaticalized in
a way normally implied for the category of tense, rather, its usage
is a matter of optional emphasis on the distinction between tem-
poral planes; see (344a), (345a). For example, (344b) is the final
180      Chapter 6.   Verb morphologysentence of a story about some events which had happened in the
speaker’s childhood, i.c., long before the story was told (see Text

yet in the last sentence the speaker decided to contrastthe time of
the events just described with the time of speech.

             ‘She had treated me badly... That is why I tied her
             with ropes and let ants eat her.’ [F48]
The same construction is used (although very rarely) with a modal
sense:
 (346)    a. tit-in     el-+kej-l-o-d’od-ek
             you-DAT    NEG-give-0-RES-SBNR-PRED

             ‘We have to go in the morning.’ (lit. ‘we are people
             going away in the morning.’)
2.10.    Desiderative
The suffix -ol’- expresses the desiderative meaning (Krejnovich
1982:146). Its productivity is hard to assess: it is practically ab-
sent from texts (where this meaning is expressed either by the
Periphrastic Prospective, or more often, by means of the verb
erd’i- ‘want’ or its derivatives), yet my consultants easily derived
Desiderative forms from various verbs. The suffix scems to belong
to the class of markers which have become obsolete too fast to lose
their productivity. It is particularly common in one, apparently
frozen, combination, leyd-ol’- ‘be hungry’ (leyde- ‘eat’).
(347)     a. qaqa,         éomon    len-d-ol’-d’e

            amd-ol’-d’ek?
            die-DESD-INTR:28G
            ‘Friend Tebegej, which way would you prefer to
            die?’ [F28]
182    Chapter   6.   Verb morphology3. Aspect
3.1.   Preluminaries
As a first approximation, the morphological means of aspect mark-
ing can be described by the following scheme, which reflects the
linear order of various aspectual suffixes within a verb form:
(348) [[[ROOT-INTERNAL ASPECT]-RESULTATIVE/INGRESSIVE]-
        IMPERFECTIVE/ HABITUAL]
The basic opposition between Perfective and Imperfective com-
prises two morphological “layers”: the Internal Aspect marking,
on the one hand, and the regular Imperfective (3.2) and Habitual
(3.4) marking, on the other.            The Internal Aspect (see 3.3) com-
prises the Perfective suffix -j- (3.3.1) and a set of non-productive
imperfective suffixes. As in many other languages, the Internal
Imperfective is more closely related to the lexical meaning of a
verb and frequently involves various sorts of quantification of situ-
ation which can be subsumed under the term Iterative (a series of
identical subevents within one time interval, on one occasion).*?
That is why these suffixes are referred to below as “Iterative suf-
fixes” (3.3.2). The Internal Perfective is compatible with the reg-
ular Imperfective suffix, the output also being the itcrative sense
(3.2.4).
    Note that the Perfective vs. Imperfective opposition (with the
Iterative as a distinguished subtype of the Imperfective) is also
maintained within the system of the Same-Subject converbs (see
1.4.3, 1.4.4, 1.4.5} which thus constitute the most. “external” layer
of aspect marking, directly associated with temporal relations be-
tween different situations.","[195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202]"
" 3.3. Data for this study and exemplification
This grammar is based on two types of data: authentic texts in
contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir and linguistic interviews with its
native speakers (see Acknowledgmenis). My text database com-
prises texts published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1989 and texts written
down by Nikolay Vakhtin (1987) and myself (1987, 1992);* some
of the latter are published in (Maslova 2001), and some are in-
cluded in this grammar {sce Appendix 3); in order to increase the
reliability of data, al] controversial and/or questionable sentences
of these texts have been double-checked with native speakers.?
    As discussed in Chapter 2, Kolyma Yukaghir has been under
strong pressure from Russian for at least several decades. This,
in combination with the well-known methodological drawbacks of
interviews, makes this sort of data far less reliable than those
elicited from authentic texts. That is why I tried to use only
text examples for illustrative purposes. As a result, some of these
examples might seem too long and complex for the point they are
intended to illustrate. Unfortunately, it is too often the case that
an authentic sentence “simplified” by a linguist for some didactic
purposes is not a reliable cxample anymore. In the case of such
languages as Yukaghir, the “unnecessary” complexity of examples
is the price to be paid for reliability of data. Even if I had a
simpler and, in some sense, “clearer” example in my field notes,
I always chose in favor of a text example.° In some cases, where
                                                About   this grammar       17this seemed to be inevitable, I did “shorten” illustrative sentences;
note that all such omissions are shown by <...>; such examples
should not be taken as “complete sentences”.
    There is, of course, a range of pheuomena which cannot be
appropriately described in this fashion because they are absent or
rare in the texts, but are readily produced by my informants in an
interview. ‘These phenomena are described in the grammar on the
basis of my field notes, but with explicit reservations concerning
the source of the data. If an example elicited in an interview
is included in the grammar (in order to avoid loss of significant
information), the source is indicated by the letter “I” after the
idiomatic translation.","[36, 37]"
"3. Semantics of grammatical         Focus
Focus marking in Yukaghir is strongly constrained in terms of the
participant roles it is compatible with: it can be applied only to
one participant per clause type, the 5 participant of an intransitive
clause and the O participant of a transitive clause (see 2.2).           In
other words, the widely known “focus prominence” of Yukaghir
has to be understood, in the case of Kolyma Yukaghir, in a rather
458     Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusspecific fashion:      it is not a language which marks which element
of a (finite) clause represents the Focus of this clause. Rather, it
is a language which marks each finite clause for whether or not its
S/O participant is the Focus.
      If the S/O constituent represents the only element within the
scope of assertion (narrow focus) or its contrastive part, Focus
marking is compulsory (3.1). Conversely, if this constituent is
excluded from the scope of assertion, only the neutral packaging
option is available. Between these poles, the Focus marking is
applied to delimit the assertion rendered by the given clause from
the preceding material.           More specifically, it identifies the S/O
constituent as the first constituent within the scope of assertion
(3.2). Thus, generally, the grammatical opposition between the
neutral and Focus packaging options is used not to mark the status
of a single constituent, but rather serves a more global information-
structuring function.
    It should be stressed that this marking operates independently
of the discourse-determined statuses of the NPs involved, like new-
ness, accessibility, etc. The most compelling evidence of this inde-
pendence is given by the Focus marking of pronominal (i.e., highly
accessible) NPs (3.2.4), on the one hand, and the regular absence
of this marking in text-initial existential clauses, where the S par-
ticipant obviously represents a new entity (3.2.5).","[477, 478]"
"See also 11.4.1.2 on the combination of negative marking with the
postposition ‘before’.",[517]
"3.1.    Predictive conditional constructions
The Predictive conditional construction implies that the situation
signified by the finite clause is possible in the future. Thus, the
finite verb can take the Future form (705)-(706), the Prospective
form (707), or the Imperative form (see 1.2}. This marking im-
poses the neutral mode of reference and thus precludes the use
of an ordinary switch-reference form in the setting function (see
1.2). As a result, the conditional switch-reference clause is em-
ployed to express either a condition under which the finite clause
situation is predicted to take place or a temporal setting for this
situation; that is, the conditional chaining does not distinguish be-
tween hypotheses (ifclauses, examples (705))}) and presumptions
(when-clauses, examples ((706)) with future time reference, or, in
other words, any presumptions concerning the future are treated
as hypothetical.”*

3.2.    Generic conditional constructions
The generic conditional construction is signified by the Imperfec-
tive (708) or the Habitual (709) form of the finite verb.                      Neither
of the clauses involved denotes a specific actual situation; rather,
they refer to any situation of the given type which might have
occurred or is going to occur. This imposes the neutral mode
of reference, hence the availability of the conditional construction
(see 1.2).
   The Imperfective marking on the finite verb signifies that the
situations described are possible (708a)-(708b) or regularly occur
(708c)-(708d) at various time points in past, present, or future,
i.e., within an unlimited period including the time of speech (see
6.3.2.3).

used to occur regularly within some period of time in the past (see

 3.3. The unreality conditional constructions
The unreality conditional construction is marked by the combina-
tion of the Inferential marking on the switch-reference form (6.2.5)
and the Irrealis marking on the finite verb (6.2.4). The conditional
clause can signify either a situation which is taken to be possible
in the future, but unlikely to happen (710a), or a counterfactual
situation with nonpast (710b) or past (710c) time reference.

398      Chapter 10.   Clause chatning3.4. Inferential conditional constructions
In the Inferential conditional construction, the conditional clause
is presented as the basis of the judgment expressed by the finite
clause. This is the only construction type which licenses condi-
tional chaining without any marking of the neutral mode of refer-
ence on the finite verb; hence, the very absence of such marking
signifies the inferential use of the conditional chaining.
    The finite verb takes the unmarked (non-Future) tense-mood
form if the implied time reference is nonpast, (711a) and the Infer-
ential form otherwise (see (711b), (712)). This distribution is de-
termined by the semantics of the Inferential marker, which implies
that the situation has taken place before the time of speech (see
6.2.5). As a result, the conditional chaining entails the (inferred)
past-in-the-future interpretation of the unmarked tense form.

Introduction
1. Kolyma Yukaghir       and its genetic affiliation
Kolyma Yukaghir is spoken by about 50 people in the settle-
ments Nelemnoye and Zyryanka, Upper Kolyma district, Yaku-
tia (Sakha) Republic and in Seymchan and Balygychan, Maga-
dan region, Russia. Until very recently, Kolyma Yukaghir has not
been written; the writing system used for the first publication of
Yukaghir folklore (Nikolaeva 1989) and currently employed in the
school in Nelemnoye is based on the Cyrillic alphabet . This gram-
mar describes the variety of Kolyma Yukaghir spoken by the oldest
generation of Yukaghirs in Nelemnoye.
    Kolyma Yukaghir is one of two existing Yukaghir languages
(which used to be referred to as dialects of Yukaghir in the liter-
ature). Another Yukaghir language, Tundra Yukaghir, is spoken
mainly in the settlements Andryushkino     and Kolymskoyc,   Lower
Kolyma district, Yakutia. The Yukaghir languages are convention-
ally considered a genetically isolated group; yet they can probably
be affiliated with the Uralic family (Angere 1956; Bouda 1941;
Collinder 1940, 1960, 1965; Nikolaeva 1988a; 1988b),2. An overview of Kolyma        Yukaghir    grammar
2.4. Phonology and morphophonemics
The vowel system comprises six short vowels,     as represented   in
(1), and their long counterparts.

The long vowels /e/, /o/, /#/ can be pronounced as the falling
diphthongs /ie/, /uo/, /u@/.
      The consonant system is represented in Table 1.
      The syllable structure is very simple: with few exceptions, there
exist only syllables of the form                         CV,       CVC (at the beginning of
words, also V, VC). Hence, there are no vowel chisters. Voiced
obstruents are impossible in word-initial and syllable-final posi-
tion; in syllable-final position, voiced obstruents alternate either
with their voiceless counterparts or with sonorants. Voiced and
voiceless consonants                 cannot         co-occur within        a consonant             cluster,
hence syllable-initial voiced obstruents are regularly devaiced at
morphemic boundaries after obstruents.
    Two types of morphophonemic strategies are employed to main-
tain the transparent syllabic structure: first, a number of Yuk-
aghir suffixes show allomorphic variation of the form -Ce- ~ --C-
(below, syllabic vs. consonantal allomorphs).                                     Basically, the allo-
morphs are chosen in such a way as to create a sequence of the
form {...~ Cie — Cy —Cy3e—...} or {...-C,
                                     — Coe — C3 ~ ...},
1.€,, a consonantal morph is selected after a syllabic morph, and
vice versa. Secondly, the epenthetic submorphs -u- and -l- can
be inserted in order to avoid consonant and vowel clustering at
morphemiec boundaries.
                                 An   overmew   of Kolyma   Yukughtr grammer   3    There arc two kinds of harmonic alternations which can be
conventionally termed palatal and labial, yet both affect only a
very restricted number of suffixes, only one of which is produc-
tive. Palatal harmony contrasts the vowels /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/
(with their long counterparts) and the vowels /a/, /o,/ (with their
long counterparts); to some extent, it also determines distribution
of the velar obstruents and their uvular counterparts. Labial har-
mony produces the alternation /e/ ~ /o/ in some suffixes after
roots with /o/ or /o/ in the first syllable.
    Word stress is mobile; to a large extent, it is determined by the
syllable structure: closed syllables and open syllables with long
vowels attract the stress to the end of a word.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"
"3.2.2. Free reciprocal markers
A free reciprocal marker can be built by combining the reciprocal
prefix n’e- and a postposition (see 7.3 for postpositions attested in
such combinations). Such items are used instead of the Reciprocal
marking on the verb (sec 6.4.5.2) if the reciprocal participants
correspond to the subject argument of the verb and the argument
of the postposition:
 (672)    a. wWe+jela              kewe-j-l’-ie-71
              RECP+after go-PFV-0-INGR-3PL:INTR
              ‘They went after each other.’
          b. mit     polog-pe       €umut     n’e+arqa     Ve-ni

              ‘Our tents were near each other.’
The reciprocal marker made up of the interior postposition molho
(in the Prolative form, see 7.3.1.4.1) can be used with natural
reciprocals (cf. 6.4.5.2.2, 2.8) in order to stress that the action
involves only members of the group construed as the $ participant
of the situation:

           ‘We have mixed with each other, so that we do not
           know now who is of which family.’ [K1]
The free reciprocal markers can be combined with the reciprocal
marking on the verb. In this context, the free comitative marker
n’aha can also function as a free reciprocal marker (674c).

3.2.3. Collective adverbials

of the Transformative form (5.5.5.3) of the substantivized numeral
irkil-l’e ‘one’ (7.2.1.1) or by means of the adverb irkil’l’en ‘to-
gether’, derived from the same numeral:

Clause chaining
Yukaghir has no grammatical means to create a coordinate struc-
ture of two (or more) finite clauses.°? The only strategy of clause
conjunction® is clause chaining, that is, a structure in which one
(typically final) clause contains a finite verb form, and each non-
final clause is marked to indicate whether or not it has the same
subject as the controlling clause (typically, the next. clause in the
chain) (Longacre 1985:264). As in other chaining languages, clause
chaining in Yukaghir neutralizes the distinction between clause co-
ordination and subordinate adverbial clauses (Longacre 1985:239),
that is, it may be employed both to conjoin clauses and to mod-
ify the proposition rendered by the finite clause.®* In particular,
clause chaining is employed in conditional (Section 3) and conces-
sive constructions (Section 4).","[386, 387, 388, 389]"
"1.2. Non-finite clauses
The case marking of the core participants in non-finite clause dif-
fers from that outlined above for finite clauses:      e Focus marking is impossible in non-finite clauses.
      e The primary participants of Nominal and Attributive relative
        clauses are encoded as Possessive modifiers (see 1.2.1).
      e Neutral O marking in non-finite clause is compatible with the
        third person A participant, under pragmatic conditions which
        can be formulated in terms of oppositions between global and
        local participants (1.2.2).
                                        Core participanis   and grammatical   relations    3291.2.1. Possessive A/S marking
The primary (A/S) participant of a Nominal clause (see {1.1 and
11.3.2) or an Attributive relative clause (11.3.1) is encoded as the
Possessive modifier of the head NP, that is, of the Nominal verb
form or the relativized NP respectively.°°> Since non-pronominal
Possessive modifiers always take the Nominative (unmarked) form
(see 8.2.1.1, 8.2.2), the case form of a noun cannot reflect this
property. Therefore, Possessive A/S marking is manifested only
by the following features:
  e Third-person pronouns take the possessive (unmarked) form
    and are used reflexively, i.e., according to the general rule
        for Possessive modifiers of NPs (7.1.1.2), see examples (606a)
        and (607a).
  e The A/S participant (different from that of the matrix clause)
    can be cross-referenced on the head NP by the Possessive
    marker. The sentences in (606b), (607b) illustrate pronom-
    inal Possessive marking, and the sentences in (606c), (607c)
        illustrate internal Possessive marking                  (see 8.2.2.1 for a de
        scription of this distinction).
  e The Plural marker on the head may indicate either the plural-
        ity of the relativized NP (607b)”* or the plurality of the S/A-
        participant of the Nominal (606c) or relative clause (607c),
        or both; see 5.3.2.3.

                                      Core   participants   and grammatical relations   3311.2.2. Differential        O marking:        global vs. local participants
In contrast to the finite clause (see 1.1.1), Neutral O marking in
non-finite clauses is compatible with a third person A participant.
Thus, the variability between Neutral and Accusative O marking
is not fully accounted for in terms of the person of A. Differential
O marking appears to correlate with the relative prominence of
the core participants outside the given clause, i.e., in some higher-
level text unit. More specifically, Neutral marking is available if
the A participant is conceived of as a salient element of a more
global text unit than the O participant, according to the following
tentative hierarchy: clause < episode < text.”
1.2.2.1.    Variability of O-marking.                Exactly as in finite clauses,
Neutral      O marking is the only option when A                      is first or second
person:

              ‘When I close my eyes in the darkness, I can see.’ [F31]
Differential O marking in clauses with third person A is illustrated
by the pairs of examples in (609)-(612) for various types of non-
finite clauses. In each pair of examples, the sentence in (a) illus-
trates the Accusative option, and the sentence in (b) illustrates the
Neutral option. These examples are intended to demonstrate that
there is no strict syntactic rule which governs the choice of one or
another option; see the examples in (611), where there seems to
be just no semantic or structural difference between the (a) and
(b)-sentences which         could    account       for the differing O marking.
Neither can the differential              O marking be explained in terms of
semantic or pragmatic properties of the NP                       (as attested in some
332      Chapter 9. Syntax of the clauseother languages).         In particular, Neutral marking may occur with
highly “individuated” and referential NPs; see (611b), (613c).**

clause represents the unique occurrence of some entity in the cur-
rent episode of the text, it usually takes Neutral marking:

See also (609b}, (610b).
   An essential point is that a local O participant may be pre-
viously mentioned in other episodes of the text; what matters
is its status within the current episode. For instance, the sen-
tence in (613c)-starts an episode describing a struggle between
two shamans (one who has eaten the girl and the other to whom
the request in (613c) is addressed), an episode in which the girl
herself does not play any role (although she is the main figure of
one of the previous episodes).            In (614b) the O participant has a
pronominal modifier tintay ‘that, aforementioned’ which indicates
that the participant plays a role in a previous episode; however,
it is its single occurrence within the current episode, hence the
Neutral marking.
      In all instances of the local O participant, the A participant
represents a continuous and/or persistent entity, that is, it does
occur in other clauses of the same episode, either within (as in
(613)) or outside (as in (614)) the given sentence. For instance,
in (614a) the A participant is not shared by the finite clause,
but nonetheless represents a prominent participant in the episode.
Similarly, the sentence in (614b) belongs to a piece of text which
describes a series of actions carried out by the A participant of
the non-finite clause, cach involving another set of non-primary
participants. Hence, the core participants have differing statuses
within the episode, although the difference is not observable on
the sentence level.

clauses of the same episode,®® both marking options are available.
For Neutral O marking to be possible, the A participant must
represent a more prominent and persistent figure of the episode or
of the text as a whole.
   For instance, in each sentence in (615) the O partictpant of the
non-finite clause is shared by the finite clause, but it is a relatively
minor element on the episode level, while the A participant is the
central figure of the episode. Apparently similar examples in (616)
instantiate another type of situation where both participants play
significant roles in the episode. For instance, the bag in (616a) is
a magic thing involved in all the events of the episode, while the
knife in (615a) is nothing more than an instrument employed only
within this particular event.

In (617), the O participant is involved in the relative clause only,
but it is a continuous and persistent entity within the episode, as
well as the main hero of the text (see Text 1). The A participant
plays a role both in the relative clause situation and in the main
clause situation, yet it is a less prominent figure of the episode
and does not persist in other episodes of the text. This situation
triggers Accusative marking.

Note that Neutral O marking does not require the A participant
to be shared by other clauses of the sentence.                    For instance, in
(612b) the O participant occurs in both clauses of the chain, the
A participant being involved in the non-finite clause only. Fur-
thermore, the O participant is a salient element of the episode (in
which the hero has to follow the way indicated by the hatchet);
yet the A participant is more “global”, being the main figure both
of the episode and of the text, hence the Neutral marking.
   This evidence seems to indicate that Neutral O marking in the
non-finite clause is available only if the A participant of that clause
is a more “global” entity, either on the episode level (see 1.2.2.2)
or on the text level. If the O participant is a more (or equally)
prominent entity both on the episode and on the text levels, it is
likely to take the Accusative marking.
                                 Core participants   and grammatical   relations   3371.3.   “Pragmatic motivations” for case marking: summary
There are four alternative mechanisms which are employed to dis-
tinguish the core participants of a transitive clause:  1. Focus marking. If the O participant is marked for the gram-
     matical Focus, the core participants of the clause are distin-
     guished by virtue of the fact that the A participant cannot
       take the Predicative marking (1.1.1).             This mechanism can
       be viewed as a sort of grammaticalization of the semantic
       affinity between the A role and the “topic”, on the one hand,
       and the O role and the “focus,” on the other. Various re-
       flexes of these affinities are attested in the grammars of many
       languages.- What may distinguish Yukaghir typologically is
       the especially prominent role of this association in the core
       clause-internal syntax.
  2. Person hierarchy. If the A participant coincides with a speech
       act participant and the O participant does not, no overt case
       marking is needed, i.e., the grammar associates the partici-
       pants of the speech act with the A role and the third person
       with the O role. Such affinities are also clearly semantically
       motivated and widely attested cross-linguistically. In addi-
       tion, the agreement marking on the v erb gives a strong formal
       support to this mechanism: the combination of a Nominative
       NP and a first- or second-person verb form accepts only the
       QO interpretation of that NP.","[348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357]"
"4.1.2. The Nominative       case
The Nominative noun phrase represents the S participant (154),
the A participant (155), or the O participant.                  The latter use is
possible if A is 1** or 2°¢ person (156) and in a non-finite clause

The Nominative is used with Possessive noun phrases (158), proper
nouns (159) and third person pronouns (160) in the predicative
function (158) and in the Focus function (159), (160) (see Chapter
12 for further details on these syntactic functions).

modifier (see also 8.2.1-8.2.2):(161)      pulut numge             ‘old man’s house’

               ‘Old man, our hare has run away.’ [F13]
The Nominative case has some other uses which are described else-
where in the grammar: (a) argument of the copula (see 12.1.1.2),
(b) apposition (8.2.1.2), (c) argument of postpositions (7.3, 8.5.2).

The Predicative noun phrase is the nominal predicate (163) or the
Focus of a clause (Krejnovich 1982: 184; 232ff}. Only S (164)
and O (165) can acquire the Predicative marking (9.1.1.2; cf. also
Note 18). The Predicative case is incompatible with Possessive
noun phrases, proper names, and third person pronouns, which
take the Nominative case in these functions {see (158)-(160)).

The Predicative marker has two variants, -lek and-(e)k, which are
formally distinguished only with vowel-final stems and in the Plu-
ral form (see Table 10, 1.4.1). There is a clear functional dis-
tinction between these variants which subsumes two interrelated
factors:7°
    First, the short. variant is used if the narrow information focus
(e.g., the focus of contrast) falls on a modifier, rather than on the
noun phrase as awhole:
 (166)    a. kukki        vosemnadcat’             nodo   azu-k

            find-OF:38G
            ‘Then she went and found traces of other
            people.’ (F54]
The relevance of this factor is indirectly shown by the fact that
only the short variant is possible in question-word questions with
a question word modifying a noun (cf. £2.3.1.1):
 (167)      godi-mie      pajpe-k               L’e-t-u-l?
            what-QLT        woman-PRED          be-FUT-0-SF?
            ‘What woman would it be?’ [F49]
Secondly, the formal opposition in question is employed to express
the distinction between the true predicative and the referential use
of noun phrases. The Predicative noun phrase in -iek ascribes a
property to (i.e., classifies) some entity.In other words, an example
like (165) might be appropriately rendered as ‘The thing I will
give to you is a fox’. The variant in -ek signifies the referential use
(i.e., the Focus NP introduces a referential entity); this is shown
by the fact that only this variant can be used if the noun phrase
is modified by a numeral, in particular by the numeral irkin ‘one’:

condition that A is third person (otherwise the Nominative case
is used, sce 4.1.2):

             ‘Your whip has killed me.’ [F19]
The Accusative marking is compatible with pronouns, proper
nouns, Possessive noun phrases and definite noun phrases (includ-
ing generic reference, as in (170a)); if a noun phrase is indefinite,
the Instrumental case is used instead (cf. Krejnovich 1982:254-255,
see also Note 21).
   There can be two Accusative noun phrases in a clause if some
kind of possessive or part-whole relationship holds between them
(cf. 5.4.2.2 for a designated body-part form).

The Accusative can mark the recipient (17la) and the addressee
(171b}, the functions most commonly fulfilled by the Dative case
(see 4.2.1, 9.2.4).

4.1.5. The Pronominal           Accusative     Case
First and second person pronouns have a special Pronominal Ac-
cusative form in -ul (see 7.1.1.1), which is used for the O partici-
pant under the same conditions as the Nominative form of nouns,
i.e., if A is first or second person (172a)-(172b), or, occasionally,
in non-finite clauses (172c) (cf. 4.1.2).

              ‘He has come in order to eat us.’ [F23}
Like the Accusative in -gele {sce 4.1.4), the Pronominal Accusative
can mark the recipient:
 (173)        met   tet-ul  = mer-uje-t                 ejre-din
              I     you-ACc. [[fly-IPFv-ss:IPFV|        walk-SuP]

              ‘T’l give you feathers for you to fly.’
4.1.6. The Instrumental case: patient-marking function
The      Instrumental   case can be used     for the O participant           if A
is third person (i.e., under the same condition as the Accusative
marking, see 4.1.4). This marking is incompatible with definite
pronouns, Possessive noun phrases and proper nouns (in these
cases, only the Accusative marking is available).

96   Chapter 5.   Nominal   morphologyIn most cases, the Instrumental O marking is applied to unmod-
ified nouns,”! since the presence of a modifier either attracts the
Focus marking (see 4.1.3), or implies definiteness and licenses the
Accusative marking thereby (see 4.1.4). This is rather a tendency
than a rule, since in a few examples the Instrumental marking is
applied to definite (175a) and/or modified noun phrases (175b).

            ‘Such animals are domestic (are kept by people).’ [F9]
Like the Accusative (see (170)), the Instrumental case can mark
the whole if some part of it constitutes the O participant of the
clause:

4.2.1. The Dative case
The Dative expresses recipient, benefactive, purpose, direction,
and the like. The recipient function is exemplified in (177) and
(178) for verbs of transfer of things (177) and information (178)
(see also 9.2.4),

The     Dative   marks    a peripheral       participant      that   is beneficially
(179) or adversely (180) affected (benefactive/malefactive):

In particular, the meaning of purpose is characteristic of the Action
Nominal Dative:
                                                       Functions of the cases   99(183)   a. jagte-lL-yin           gon-t

See 6.1.3.3, 17.4.4 for functions of the “frozen” Action Nominal
Possessive Dative (Supine).
    The Dative marking can be doubled,whereby the second Da-
tive (normally, the Possessive Dative form) is used to specify the
direction more precisely. The following examples illustrate this
phenomenon for a body part (184a) and for the Possessive form
of the AD-postposition al’ (see 7.3.1.1.1):
(184)   a. éul-e             juko-d’on-ben-die-lek

           ‘God’s assistants do not approach him closely.’ [F31]
In its temporal use, the Dative expresses a span of time:

           night-TMP moon              day-DAT

                   ‘The hare and the old man worked the whole day from
               dawn to dusk.’ [F3]
In one example, the Dative is used temporally in the combination
with the Russian preposition do ‘until’:
 (186)             do     ugujel-yin           = mie-de-7i

               ‘They waited until the morning.’ [F36]
The Dative constitutes an element of some verb patterns (9.2.4,
9.2.6) and is used within the Body-Part form (see 4.2.2); see also
8.1.1 for its marginal use as a noun modifier.","[109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"
"5.3.1.    Correlative adverbial clauses
The correlative adverbial clause can have spatial (885), temporal
(886), or comparative (887) semantics, depending on the question
word employed.               The question word                godo ‘how’ can be used not
only with comparative meaning (887), but with temporal meaning
(886) as well.!°° This word godo ‘how’ can be used without a
correlate in the main clause, see (886b), (887c).

5.3.2.    Correlative relative clauses
Correlative relative clauses are made                up as finite indirect ques-
tions, with the demonstrative pronoun tamun ‘that’ (889a)-(889b)
or a full NP (890) serving as the correlate in the main clause; in one
instance, the correlate in the main clause is the universal quantifier
(889c),
      This pattern can be used for the same types of relativization as
the Attributive relative clauses (12.3.1): for relativization of the
subject (889a), of the direct object (889b)-(889c), of the Possessor
(890a), of the temporal (890b) and spatial (890c) adverbial. The
spatial relative clause (890c) can combine a question word with the
Result Nominal form (cf. the similar effect in correlative adverbial
clauses constructed according to the same pattern).

1. Grammaticalized             coreference phenomena
1.1.    Clause-internal phenomena
1.1.1. Participant reflexivization
The only explicit means of assigning two participant roles in a
clause to a single referent is the Reflexive marking on the verb,
which is described in 6.4.5.3, The controller of such reflexiviza-
tion is always the A participant, the target, the O participant.
Accordingly, a pronoun in the direct object function can only be
non-reflexive,
   If a participant other than O is coreferential with the subject,
the regular personal pronouns are used, so that only the context
can disambiguate reflexive vs. non-reflexive use of a pronoun. The
sentences in (891) give examples of reflexively and non-reflexively
used Dative personal pronouns. The sentences in (892) illustrate
reflexively used personal pronouns in other syntactic positions.

"5.1. Possessive pronouns us. Possessive markers
Formally, the pronominal arguments of postpositions are encoded
in the same way as pronominal possessive modifiers of nouns, ei-
ther by the possessive forms of personal pronouns (7.1.1.2) or by
the Possessive marking (5.2, 2.2) on the postposition itself. Yet, in
NPs, the possessive forms of third person pronouns are reflexive,
that is, they signify that the Possessor is coreferential with the
subject of the clause. In postpositional phrases, this is not the
case, i.e., the possessive forms may (599), but need not (600) be
coreferential with the subject:

               ‘This woman’s dog jumped around her showing
               affection.’
To some extent, the non-reflexive use of these forms is determined
by the fact that not all postpositions have the Possessive mor-
phology, i.¢e., the non-reflexive counterpart of possessive pronouns
is not always available (see 7.3 for the list of postpositions which
have Possessive forms). Quite predictably, since one member of
the opposition is not available, the opposition is neutralized.
   It should be noted, however, that the possessive pronouns may
be used non-refiexively with those postpositions which do take the
                                                 Postposttional phrases   321Possessive markers; see (600c) and (601):

             ‘The bag lay near him.’ [F49]
In other words, the functional opposition between reflexive (free)
and non-reflexive (bound) pronominal modifiers is neutralized for
arguments of all postpositions, independently of the morphological
availability of the latter option in each particular case. It may be
assumed, therefore, that the noun-to-postposition grammatical-
ization in Yukaghir involves two partially independent processes:
   e Reinterpretation of the possessive modifier as the argument
        of a postposition. The possessive form of pronominal modi-
        fiers is preserved, but it is reinterpreted as a non-Possessive
        instance of the personal pronoun, hence the loss of the reflex-
        ive meaning (which is associated only with the possessive use
        of personal pronouns, see 7.1.1).
   e Loss of the nominal morphology, in particular, of the Posses-
        sive morphology.","[339, 340, 341]"
" 2.2, Links between same-type situations
There are several grammatical means to combine or to establish
an explicit link between clauses referring to semantically similar
situations, i.e., situations which can be signified by means of the
same verb (in a particular case, between clauses describing the
same referential situation). Such a link can be established either
by means of a connective particle (2.2.1-2.2.2) or by using a single
verb form for both situations (2.2.3).",[548]
"1.3.4. Functions of the Result Nominal
The Result Nominal has an extremely wide array of functions,
including the result of a situation, the affected participant of a
situation, the situation itself, etc.

The Result. Nominal can be used to refer fo the location where
the situation has taken place (see also 11.4.2, 13.5.3.1 on the use
of the Result Nominal for Spatial adverbial clauses}. This use
is apparently motivated by the fact that the location is likely to
preserve some traces of the situation.

The Result, Nominal can be used to express situations and facts.
In these functions, the Result Nominal serves as the relative-past
counterpart of the Action Nominal; see 7/.1 for the use of the
Result Nominal in various types of complement clauses, /7/.4.1.1

"3.1.1. Question words
If the 8/O constituent is represented by an interrogative pronoun
or contains a question word, it has to be marked as the Focus
(796).

This case is fully grammaticalized: the Focus marking is manda-
tory whenever a question word occurs in the S/O position, ie.,
not only in question-word questions, but also in dependent clauses
made up as questions (where the interrogative pronoun functions
as a sort of relative pronoun,     see 19.5.3), and in exclamatory sen-
tences with question words (see        3.3.1.1).
460      Chapter 12.   Nominal predicates   and grammatical   Focus3.1.2.    Narrow focus
If the answer to a question-word question like (796) is constructed
as implied by the question, that is, if it answers exactly that ques-
tion, without any reformulation of its presuppositions, the con-
stituent that “replaces” the question word is also marked as Focus.
The sentence in (797a) is the answer to the question in (793b) and
(797b) is the answer to (796b):

This environment can be subsumed under a broader category of
“narrow focus” clauses, i.e., clauses in which the S/O constituent or
one of its subconstituents is the only element of the assertion, the
remainder of the clause being presupposed and/or implied. This
environment obligatorily triggers the Focus packaging variant:

Note that the notion of contrastive Focus, as employed here, is not
equal to the notion of the focus of contrast, as defined by Chafe
(1976). More specifically, the contrastive Focus environment does
not imply that the remainder of the clause is presupposed, i.e.,
the contrastive Focus is not taken to be a kind of narrow focus
(as in 3.1.2), The only additional condition is that the contrasting
                                         Semantics of grammatical Focus   463element is a part of the assertion (which is intended to rule out so
called “contrastive topics”).
      Thus,   the Focus packaging variant is compulsory          if the $/O
constituent (or its sub-constituent) represents the narrow focus
or the contrastive part of the assertion. Either condition is sufh-
cient for the Focus marking to be compulsory. Of course, the rare
clear instances of the focus of contrast, (where these conditions are
combined) also involve the Focus marking:

              ‘It is not me that is doing this, it is a reven that is
              doing this.’
3.2. Free Focus marking
3.2.1. Functions of Focus marking
If the scope of assertion comprises both the finite verb and the
S/O constituent (“broad focus”), and there is no explicit contrast,
Focus marking is not mandatory, i.e., the broad scope of assertion
generally allows both packaging options. In this situation, Focus
marking (in contrast to neutral clause structure) has a twofold
semantic impact: it signifies that the S/O constituent is a part
of the assertion and delimits the assertion rendered by the given
clause from the previously introduced information, i.e., the Focus
is always the first constituent of the sentence which is within the
scope of assertion.
    The role played by each of these factors is slightly different for
intransitive (SF marking)       and transitive (OF marking) clauses.
For intransitive clauses, the semantic difference between the neu-
tral and Focus packaging variants is appropriately approximated
as the opposition between clauses with the S participant outside
vs.    within the scope of assertion, i.e., Focus marking is normally
required to impose the so-called thetic, or broad-focus informa-~
tion structure (3.2.2).      For transitive clauses, this factor is less
significant, since the O participant is not the “default” topic of the
transitive clause {as it is the case for the S participant). Accord-
464      Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusingly, the delineating function plays the major role in the choice
of a packaging option, i.e., Focus marking is applied to signal a
salient information-structuring boundary immediately before the
O constituent (3.2.3).
    There are two environments which suggest. that this distinction
is a matter of a tendency of usage, rather than of a strict func-
tional opposition between SF marking and OF marking. First, a
pronominal O constituent must be marked for the grammatical
Focus to be included into the scope of assertion. In this case, the
type of NP implies the “default” topical status and thus overrides
the difference between the S participant and the O participant
(3.2.4).      Secondly, the SF marking is not applied if the S con-
stituent is exactly the first element of a text, i.e., when there is
simply nothing to be delimited from. This observation appears to
indicate that the delineating effect is involved in the SF semantics
as well. This is most clearly illustrated by the structural difference
between text-initial and text-internal existential sentences (3.2.5).
   Thus, the general semantic impact of Focus marking is to
present the S/O constituent as the first element of the assertion.
Note that the compulsory Focus marking environments can also
be subsumed under this general formulation.","[479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484]"

"3.3.2.    Iterative suffixes3.3.2.1. The suffixes which are subsumed here under the term Iter-
ative (Krejnovich 1982:126-134) have a variety of meanings, most
of which have to do with some sort of quantification of situations.
This includes, in particular, distributive and dispersive meanings
(several identical subevents involving different participants and/or
different locations or directions). These suffixes can also render the
same meanings as the Imperfective in -nu-, so that, for example,
an Iterative verb can denote an action in progress (see also 6.3.4.1
on the semantic effect of the regular Imperfective when combined
with an Iterative suffix).                Most often, it is not the case that the
semantics of a given suffix can be reduced to onc particular mean-
ing (although some tendencies will be noted below). That is why
all these suffixes are glossed as Iterative (ITER), which might not
reflect the meaning implied by a specific example.
    In a number of cases, the Iterative suffixes are opposed to suf-
fixes -de- or -re-, which build up the (semantically) unmarked
                                                                      Aspect   193counterparts of the Iterative verbs. It does not seem appropriate
to gloss these suffixes as Perfective, although this might be implied
by the idea of the Internal Aspect opposition: these suffixes do not
signify that sort of bounding the situation which is associated with
the term “perfective” in general and with the Yukaghir Perfective
marker in particular. For the purpose of interlinear glossing, I will
use the term non-Iterative for such suffixes (gloss NONIT); thus, if
this abbreviation appears in a gloss, this means that the verb has
an Iterative counterpart (where the given suffix is replaced by an
Iterative one).
   The Iterative suffixes are listed below with some sentences in-
tended to illustrate their meaning, and with some notes on their
distribution. For a representative list of Iterative verbs, see Ap-
pendix 2.
3.3.2.2.    The suffix -ujfi)- (Krejnovich 1982:131) takes the form
-uji- if its second syllable constitutes the final syllable of the word;
if the suffix is followed by a syllabic morph, its final /2/ is dropped
or reduced. This suffix produces the /j/ ~ /é/ alternation in /j/-
initial morphs (see 3.3.3.3.2).
   This suffix signifies that the situation is viewed as a protracted
process, in most cases, consisting of a series of identical sub-
situations {a multiplicative situation); it combines only with in-
transitive verbs (with few exceptions). Most of the authentic text
instances of such verbs are Imperfective or Iterative converbs (see
1.4.3, 1.4.5). In each pair of examples below, (b) contains a verb
marked for Iterative, (a), its unmarked counterpart.

              ‘They lead a nomadic life.’
In some cases, the derivative with -uji- is opposed to the Perfective
derivative with -j, while the unmarked counterpart may be absent,
e.g., kewe-j- ‘to leave, to go away’ vs. kew-uji- ‘to be in the process
of leaving, to go away and come back several times, without being
able to leave after all’.
3.3.2.3.    The suffix -(u)Zu- is attached to a very restricted set of
verbs and signifies the dispersive meaning                   (movement    in various
directions, location at various places):
 (369) a. tamun           ti+ta             uj- de               Soromo-pul-ge

           ‘The blood from the shoeless feet of her running
           children lay on the reindeer moss here and there,
           turning it red.’ [F7|
Practically in all instances, there is no morphologically unmarked
stem. The Dispersive suffix is opposed to the suffix -re-, cf. Sej-re-
vs. Seg-uzu- ‘run away’; jze-re- vs. jie-Zu- ‘swim’; ej-re- vs. eg-uzu-
‘walk’. In one single case, the suffix seems to confer a reciprocal
meaning: jug-uZu- ‘kiss each other’ (from jugi- ‘kiss’).
3.3.2.4. The suffix -éi- (Krejnovich 1982:126-127) is used with a
closed class of verbs, mostly transitive, and most often has the
distributive meaning (action upon several distinct objects).
(370)   a. terike, mit ugr-pe        kude-s’t-ge

           ‘He took away all those things of his.’ [F31]
This suffix can also express progressive (371a) and iterative (371b-
371c).

               ‘When he jumps from there, he always injures his leg,
               making it ache.’ [I]
Almost all the derivatives with this suffix are opposed to the verbs
with the suffix -de-, which thus form semantically unmarked coun-
terparts of such verbs, cf. am-de- vs. am-ci- ‘die’, kude-de- vs.
kude-ét- ‘kill’, etc. In some cases, the basic (morphologically un-
marked) stem also exists and represents the non-Causative coun-
terpart. of the derived verbs; see 4.3.3.5.
3.3.2.5. The suffix -7- (Krejnovich 1982:126) is used with a very
small group of transitive verbs (see Appendix 2), with the itera-
tive/imperfective meaning, cf. the following examples:
 (372)      a. tat     gorobo     aj     kigi-m
               CA      cow        CP     jab-TR:3SG

                ‘He killed one of them by jabbing him with a spear
                (more than once).’3.3.2.6. The suffix -é- (Krejnovich 1982:129) is used with a closed
class of verbs, all of which are derived by one of the non-productive
Causative suffixes, sce 4.3.3; the meaning is most often distribu-
tive:
 (373)     a. Sebis’e           nono-gele         Saqal’e-§-nu-de

               ‘He was gathering wild-rose branches and bringing

                                                                    Aspect   197            b. mied’i-n         igeje-pul-gele   abudu-de

               ‘He is fastening and tying sledge ropes.’3.3.2.7.     The suffix -(n)d’- (Krejnovich 1982:133).          The suffix is
associated, in most. cases, with various sorts of dispersive meaning
(distribution of the event among various locations). In a number
of cases, there is no morphologically unmarked counterpart, the
non-Iterative verb being derived by another non-productive suffix
(see 6.4.3.3.3),       Being applied to a transitive verb, this suffix in-
volves, in addition, detransitivization (by elimination of the direct
object); for instance,       the intransitive verb ege-nd’i- ‘look in vari-
ous directions’ {see (374c)) is derived from a transitive verb, egie-
‘look at something through a hole’.

3.4.     Habitual
3.4.1.     Formation
Basically, the Habitual form is derived by reduplication of the Im-
perfective suffix, -nu- (cf. Krejnovich 1982:137-138). The output
of this operation has the form -nun- if immediately followed by the
Intransitive marker -d’e- (that is, in the first and second person
198      Chapter    6.    Verb morphologyforms of the Intransitive paradigm, see Table 13) or the Subject
Nominal marker -d’on- (see 3.3.3.1.1 on the /j/ ~ /d’/ alterna-
tion), -nunnu- otherwise, cf.:(375)      a.       ejrie-nun-d li                   ‘we used to walk/walk’
                    walk-HAB-INTR:1PL

                    mon-nun-d’on                     ‘one who used to say’
                    sav-HAB-SBNR
           b.            ejrie-nunnu-k               ‘(where) did/do you walk?’
                    walk-HAB-ITR:2SG
                    erie-nunnu-m                     ‘he used to hate/hates’
                    hate-HAB-TR:38GIf the verb contains an Iterative suffix, the Habitual form can be
derived just by adding the regular Imperfective suffix. Classifying
such forms as Habitual (rather than Imperfective) is somewhat
controversial, given the partial intersection of the functions of the
Imperfective and the Habitual (see 3.2.3).                       Yet such forms are
generally used to express meanings not characteristic of the Im-
perfective (for instance, a usual, recurrent situation in the past, see
(377)) and appear not to accept some of the Imperfective senses
(for example,progressive).","[212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218]"
"1.1.4.    The Intensified form
The Intensified form is built by attaching the postpositional mor-
pheme zd’e to the pronominal stem. The form is used instead of
the Nominative case form in order to emphasize the identity of
the participant, cither in contrast to other possible candidates for
this role (439a}, or to stress that the action is carried out by this
participant alone (439b); in (439c), both factors are present.
 (439)     a. tet-id’ie         lek-telle          me+kimdan’e-jek

           ‘She has secretly eaten the meat (=elk) that I have
           killed on her own.’ [F48]
Nowadays, the Intensified form of personal pronouns is often cre-
ated by means of the Russian loanword sam ‘self’. The resulting
form of the third person singular is either tude+sam (440c) or
tut-sam ‘he himself’ (440d).

          ada-       separated demonstrative (‘this, that there’)
          ta _ distal (invisible) demonstrative (‘that; such’)
and the interrogative stem              go-      ~   ga- (‘which?’).    The       demon-
strative and interrogative stems show some (although not abso-
lute) parallelism in derivation of their attributive, nominal, spatial,
qualitative, and temporal forms. These forms are given in Table
19. This subsection describes only the morphology and syntactic
functions of various forms. For functional distinctions between the
demonstrative series, see 1.2.2. The Interrogatives are described
in 1.3. See also 1.2.2.1-1.2.2.2 for complex forms associated with
                                                                                 Pronouns   239particular discourse functions (examples (458), (462)).
1.2.1.1. The Attributive demonstratives are normally used as de-
terminers:
 (442)   a. kin-tek                tig      mino-le         ejre-t-u-l?
            who-PRED               this    raft-INSTR       walk-FUT-0-SF
            ‘Who will sail on this raft?’ [F9]

            “Thank you for having brought this package
            back.’ [F32]
         c. tudel     jobs                modo-l’el             tay     pulut

            ‘He lived in the forest, that old man.’ [F3]
In some cases, although very rarely, they are used as NPs, instead
of the respective nominal forms (pronouns):

            ‘Having skinned that one, without taking any part of
            it, he went home.’ [F34]
The demonstrative            tay         in the Plural form is used to express as-
sociative plural meaning (‘X and those associated with X’). This
construction is most common with kinship terms (444a)-(444b)
and proper names (444c).

1.2.1.2.     The      nominal    demonstratives           (demonstrative    pronouns)
are used as noun phrases, referring to both inanimate (445) and
animate (446) entities.
 (445)     a. tet      gon        num-mek            tugn?

              that    name-Poss T.
              ‘That one, his name was Tebegej.’ [F28]
The Nominal demonstratives are inflected for Number and Case
in the standard way (see 5.1). For specific syntactic and discourse
uses of the Nominal demonstratives, see 1.2.2.
                                                               Pronouns   2411.2.1.3. The interrogative Nominal gadon is used only in the Local
case forms or in combination with postpositions.             Thus, it serves
as an alternative for the Locative (adverbial) Interrogatives:
 (447)   a. pulun-die,      — qo-t        kel-u-k?

            “Where have you come from?’1.2.1.4. The adverbial Locative paradigm (Locative — Ablative —
Prolative — Directional; see 4.2.2) is fully preserved only for the
Separated Demonstrative         (448); otherwise,     one form is used for
both Locative (Essive) and Prolative meanings (449).

qualitative verbs (see 4.3.2 for the properties of qualitative verbs,
6.3.6.4.2 for other qualitative verbs derived by means of the same
242      Chapter 7.   Morphology    of ctosed classessuffix). The examples in (450) illustrate the verb-like morpholog-
ical and syntactic behavior of these forms.

However,       there is one important                   exception:           as noun modifiers,
these forms occur both in the verbal Attributive form (451) and
in the unmarked form (452). In this sense, they can be taken to
belong to the small group of putative adjectives described in 4.3.4.

absolute time of the event (453) or to the temporal distance be-
tween two events (454). The form tane is obsolete, and the respec-
tive meaning (‘long ago’) is commonly rendered by the form tuda
(453b).

distinguished in terms of the distance from the point of reference
(in particular, visibility (Krejnovich 1982:235-237)) and in terms
of the control and direct availability for the speaker.
      The series in é- refers to most proximate entities and/or lo-
cations which are directly available to the speaker (for example,
something belonging to the speaker):
 (455)     a. te-gide    ejre-s’
              here-DIR_ walk-PFV:INTR:3SG
              ‘He has come here (= to me).’

               ‘That is why we have made this raft.’ [F9]
The series in ada- refers to entities and/or locations which                     are
not taken to be remote (in particular, they can be visible for
the speaker), but are not directly available and/or not under the
speaker’s control; such entities often belong or are nearer to the
addressee or to a third person:

Finally, the Distal series in ta@ refers to entities and/or locations
which are considered remote and invisible to the speaker:
 (457)   a. tay     mémeé gol+l’e?
            that    bear  where+be(ITR:3sc)?
            ‘Where is that bear?’ [F17]

            want-CAUS-OF:38G
            ‘T want to return to the days of my youth.’ [F58]
The Locative demonstratives of the ¢a-series can be combined with
the item ejmz ‘across, on the other side’ (see 3.1.5.2 on its use as a
postposition; cf. also Krejnovich 1982:237). In contrast with the
simple forms, such combinations can be used only in the deictic
function:
 (458)   a. ejmi+ta-nide         qon-delle      izulbe
            [across-therc-DIR    go-SS:PFV]    tiredness

            ‘Let us go there and have a rest.’ [F31|

           arrive-FUT-INTR:1SG
           ‘If I reach that place there, I will be able to reach the
           tent.’
The nominal Demonstratives tugn and adugn can be used as deic-
tic subjects of a cleft-like construction, whereby the deictic element
is followed by a complete Focus-marking clause (see 12.2.3).
1.2.2.2. The anaphoric function.      The demonstrative pronoun
tabun is often used to pick up a previously mentioned entity. This
is the only way to refer back to an inanimate entity (459); for ref-
246      Chapter    7.   Morphology        of closed classeserence to an animate entity, a personal pronoun can be used as
well. Generally, the demonstrative (in contrast with a personal
pronoun) involves a certain amount of contrast. In particular, it
often refers to the entity introduced in the previous sentence as
the grammatical Focus:

Moreover, the demonstratives are strikingly more common in the
grammatical Focus position than the personal pronouns (460); see
12.3.2.3 on the pronominal Focus.

The other Nominal demonstratives are impossible in this function.
                                                            Pronouns      247   The Attributive demonstrative toy (or, much more rarely, tiz)
can be used as a determiner when the noun phrase refers to an
aforementioned entity:
 (461)   a. tay      pajpe    atag-un      ug-n’e-l’el
            that     woman    two-ATTR     child-PRPR-INFR(3SG)

            ‘These hunters were pursuing it, but not catching
            up.’ [F34]
In addition, there is a complex         Attributive form   tin+tan     ‘that’
(Krejnovich 1982:237), which can be used only to refer back to
an aforementioned entity, i.e., this form resolves the ambiguity
between deictic and anaphoric interpretations of the Attributive
demonstratives:
(462)    a. tintay     atag-un      pajpe-d+upr-pe            pude

            ‘That old woman gave (him) some tea.’ [F19]
Krejnovich (1982:237) suggests that this form represents the frozen
combination of the Attributive demonstratives tin ‘this’ and tay
‘that’. In addition to this form, he cites a nominal complex form
tin-tamun, which is not attested in my corpus.
1.2.2.3. The resumptive function. The Nominal demonstratives
are often used to refer to an aforementioned event as a whole;
this function is particularly typical for the demonstrative tabun
~ tamun, yet tugn is also possible (see also 14.2.1.2):

The demonstrative pro-forms can also be used as main clause cor-
relates for correlative subordinate clauses (see 13.5.3).
1.2.2.4. Discourse-linking function. The distal Demonstratives in
ta, in particular the Ablative form tat and the Local forms of the
Nominal demonstrative tabun, serve as a very general device link-
ing a clause to the preceding discourse (see 14.2.1.2, 14.3). In
this function, these forms can be glossed as ‘then, so, thus, that is
why’, etc.; the form fat serves as most semantically vague connec-
tive adverbial (it is therefore represented as CA in the interlinear
glosses.)

The      pronoun    pgn ~ pen can refer to the physical environment
(with a meaning like ‘world’, ‘nature’, ‘environment’, etc.; see
(465)-(466}), or to the physical condition of a person (467). The
former meaning is most often evoked               in descriptions of weather
situations, seasonal changes, etc.            (465); see also 9.2.2.2 for this
clause pattern.      However, a less conventionalized usage is possible
as well (466) (for convenience, this word is glossed as ‘it’ in the
interlinear translations).

considered the bound (grammaticalized) form of pgn ~ pen.*®
250      Chapter 7. Morphology of closed classes1.3. Interrogative pro-forms
Most interrogative pro-forms are derived from the interrogative
stem go- ~ ga-. e.g., godo ‘how’, godi-t ‘why’, gamun ‘how many’
(for more interrogatives, see Table 19); there are three other in-
terrogative words, two interrogative pronouns, kin ‘who, whose’
and leme ~ neme ‘what, who’, and the Interrogative adverbial
noyon ‘what for’. The Interrogative pronouns have the regular
mon-Possessive nominal paradigm (as described in 5.1), but for-
mally slightly different predicative forms, kin-tek and lem-dik ~
nem-dik respectively (Krejnovich 1982:234-235):
 (468)     a. kin-tek           jagte-l?
               who-PRED        sing-SF
               ‘Who is singing?’ [F13]
           b. tet     lem-dik           ini-me                      lebte    budie?

               ‘What are you afraid of on the earth?’ [F31]
The      Interrogatives      are    used    in     direct   and   indirect   questions
(13.2.2, 13.5.2) and in correlative subordinate clauses (see 13.5.3).
   The Locative Interrogative gon ‘where’ and the Manner inter-
rogative godo ‘how’ can form phonological complexes with the ex-
istential verb l’e ‘be’: gol+l’e- ‘Where is/was?’ (see 19.2.2.1),
godo+l’e- ‘How is/was?’ (see 13.2.2.2). The latter combines also
with the verb a- ‘make’: god-a- ‘What/how did {A) behave with
respect to (O)? (see 13.2.2.2 for examples).","[256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270]"
"
2.2.2.    Verbs
Verbs fall into two major classes, transitive and intransitive. Each
class has two series of Indicative finite forms, for main clauses
which are neutral with respect to grammatical Focus (Main forms)
and for clauses with intransitive subject (S) or direct object (O}
marked for grammatical Focus (SF and OF forms, respectively).
The finite verb agrees in person/number with the subject (the OF
paradigm and especially the SF paradigm are less distinctive than
the Main one). The Imperative is expressed by a distinct series
of forms, which are shared by transitive and intransitive verbs.
Illustrative paradigms are given in Table 3 (for the verbs modo-
‘sit, stay’ and a- ‘makc’).
     There are Interrogative forms which are used only in question-
word questions in which the questioned constituent is not S/O (in
the latter case, the respective Focus-indicating forms are used).
For the first person subject, there arc special Interrogative person
markers, -m 18G, -ok IPL. The second and third person Interroga-
tive forms differ from the Main Indicative forms only in absence of
the (in)transitivity morphs -j/e)- / -m(e)- (e.g., (qodo) a-k ‘(how)
you (8G) made’, (godo) a-met ‘(how) you (PL) made’, (godo) a
‘(how) he made’, (godo) a-ni ‘(how) they made’).
   The verb morphology is clearly aspect-dominated; the regularly
marked aspect. meanings are Imperfective, Ingressive, Resultative,
and Habitual:
6     Chapter i. Introduction(2)    Productive Aspect markers:
       Imperfective  -nu-         a-nu-m ‘he is/was making,
                                                     he makes’
       Habitual             -nun(nu)-        d-nunnu-m    ‘he used to make’
       Ingressive           -a- /-te-        a-l-a-m. ‘he began to make’
       Resultative           -of)-           d-l-o-j ‘it is made’
The only obligatorily marked tense distinction is Future vs. Non-
Future (the suffix -te-~-t- for Future, zero marking for Non-
Future), although the Past may be expressed through periphrastic
verb forms. The Periphrastic Past is built by putting the Subject
Nominal or Relative Nominal verb form in the predicative posi-
tion:(3)    Tense marking:
       Non-Future               a-™                    ‘he is making/made’
       Future                   a-te-m                 ‘he will make’
       Periphrastic             a-l-bed-ek             ‘(smb) has/had made’
              Past              Taake-ANH-RELNR-PREDThe verb is inflected for several moods;                 major mood   forms are
Inferential (the marker is -l’el-), Prospective (-moZi:-), and Irre-
alis (marked by a pre-verbal morpheme ot-/et-). There is also a
Periphrastic Prospective form made up as a combination of the
Supine form with the existential verb l’e- ‘be’:(4)    Major Mood forms:
       Inferential          a-lel-u-m         ‘he appears to have made’
       Prospective          a-mozZi-m         ‘he is going to make’
       Irrealis             ot+a-m            ‘he would have made’
       Periphrastic
       Prospective          a-din l’e-m       ‘he is about to make, is making’The verb has a rich system of various nonfinite forms. The major
nonfinite forms are illustrated in (5) by the verb SubeZe- ‘run’:

       Conditional converb      SubeZe-de-h-ne    ‘if he runs...’
There are four regular valence-changing means, the Reciprocal
(pre-verb n’e+), the Reflexive (pre-verb met--), the Causative (suf-
fixes -S-, -§-€il’e-), and the Resultative (-off)-), and a number of
nonproductive valence-changing suffixes.","[25, 26, 27]"

2.8, Functions of the Future
Basically, the Future form refers to a future situation, with vari-
ous modal nuances like promise, hypothesis, potentiality, necessity,
desirability, etc.

The Future form can have the meaning of recommendation or
instruction, in particular with the second person subject (325); if
the subject is 1PL, this form can be used to express a proposal for
common action (326).         Hence, in these two meanings, the Future
170   Chapter   6.   Verb morphologycan assume the functions of the Imperative (see 2.8).

The Irrealis is used to express counterfactual situations, most often
in the finite clause of counterfactual conditional constructions (see
also 1.4.6, 10.3.3).

This form can be also used, although less frequently, to express
potentiality or desirability.

               ‘You had better sleep, like I do.’ [K4] 2.5. Functions of the non-Future Inferential
The most frequent meaning of the Inferential is the hearsay ev-
idential; in this meaning, it is used for narration, if the speaker
describes events which he has not witnessed himself (Jochelson
1905; Krejnovich 1982:140), in particular in fairy tales and mytho-
logical stories. In this case, the Inferential is the major form used
throughout the story (see Text 1, and all the examples in the gram-
mar where the meaning of the Inferential is not rendered in the
idiomatic translation). In contrast to this, the events in which the
speaker participated himself, or otherwise witnessed, are narrated
in the simple non-Future form (see Text 2). In the following picce
of a text, the speaker switches from the simple form in the first
two clauses (which describe situations witnessed by him himself}
to the Inferential in the next one, referring to a more remote time
which he could only hear about.

            no Soviets yet, when there were priests, he learned
            {INFR) to read Old Russian.’ [K4]
In this meaning, the Inferential partly takes over the functions of
the absent Past form (Krejnovich 1982:140).
   The Inferential form can be used to render information inferred
on the basis of some other facts.

            ‘If he is not working now, he must have finished.’ [I]
The Inferential form can express mirative experience. In the fol-
lowing examples, it is used to signal that the situation differs from
what was expected by the speaker (that is, from what he sees, he
infers that he used to have some wrong presumptions).

                   ‘You have turned out to be a clever person!’ [F31|
The Inferential can be used to describe actions the speaker has
carried out himself. In this case, the Inferential signifies that the
action was unintentional (333a)-(333b), had unexpected results
(333c), or that the speaker was not aware of all circumstances
(333d) or consequences (333e) (Krejnovich 1982:141-142).

The Inferential and the Future markers can be combined to express
a hypothesis (Krejnovich 1982:140):

This form is used only to express a hypothesis about the past or
present (not about the future).","[188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195]"
"      . Accusative marking.             If A is third person,              a non-Focus O
         participant     takes the Accusative                or the Instrumental      form
         (5.4.1.4, 5.4.1.6).
These marking options are exemplified in the respective sections
on case functions (5.4.1), as well as by many other examples in
this book; for a description of Focus marking, see 12.2-12.3.
      Note that the so called “Anaphoric NPs” (proper nouns, third-
person personal pronouns,               and Possessive NPs)                do not take the
Predicative case form (5.4.1.1, 5.4.1.2}.                      Instead, the Nominative
form is used        in all positions         where          the Predicative case would
otherwise be required.             As a result, in sentences like (605) both
core participants are in the Nominative case form. 51

However, such sentences are never ambiguous, since they occur
only if the O participant is marked as the Focus and the Focus NP
always takes the preverbal position. Hence, the NP representing
the A participant cannot intervene between the Focus and the
finite verb (see 1.5.1). In addition, the Focus NP (which is implied
by the verb form) cannot be omitted, so that the Nominative NP in
the preverbal position can only be interpreted as the O participant.
Thus, it is the grammatical Focus marking (as manifested in the
linearization rules, constraints on pro-drop, and the OF form of
the verb) that is employed to distinguish the core participants in
such. clauses.","[346, 347]"
