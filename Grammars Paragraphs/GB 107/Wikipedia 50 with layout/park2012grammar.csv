       The negative existential verb neesá is used to negate existence, as in (271), and to negatepossession, as in (272). It is likely that the negative existential verb is also used to form negativeperfective constructions as in Crow (c.f., Graczyk 2007:154); however, there are no tokens in mydatabase.","[221, 222]"
       The negative existential verb neesá to not exist can also be used as a response word. Inthis function it can also occur both as an interjection (neesá no) and a verb (neesác there is nosuch thing). The positive existential counterpart of neesá is madú to exist. It can only be used asa verb (madúc there is such a thing) and never as an interjection (*madú yes).,[480]

"           The stem has to be inflected for the plural when the agents and objects of the reciprocalstem are co-indexical. The reciprocal stems need to be inflected in the plural also when thereciprocal prefix occurs in the direct object role and plural agents are referred to. In theimperative forms in (219), the plural imperative speech-act marker -ara is used in affirmativecommands and -ara plus the negative suffix -dhaa in negative commands since the command isgiven to more than one person. The verb stem is not in the plural in (220) because the reciprocalprefix is not coindexed with the agent; rather, it represents relations between elements of the setrepresented by the object.",[207]

"6.1.3 CommandsCommands are used to elicit action from one or more addressees either by directing them orsuggesting that they engage in an activity. Prohibitive, or negative, commands direct theaddressee to refrain from an activity. In Hidatsa, there are two types of commands. The morecommon one is a prototypical imperative that has no other attitudinal connotations. The otherone, the precative, softens the tone of the command and makes it appear more like a politerequest or an entreaty rather than an order. Imperative and precative forms of active stems areinflected for number but not for person. Commands formed from middle and reflexive verbs areinflected for second person and number.",[266]

(66)    maaruwa / maaruu       someone, anyone; something, anything        In addition to independent adverbs and pronouns, nuwa serves as a base for deriving afew verbs, such as maaruwádhaa to be nothing, be OK and nuwahgarú something to be wrongwith something.

"        The only major shortcoming of Jones’s transcriptions is the unreliability of his pitchmarking. According to Jones (personal communication), he tried to describe Hidatsa in terms ofstress-accent, only realizing after his field work that in reality it is a pitch-accent language. It alsoturns out that his main informant, though fluent, was reputed to speak a highly idiosyncraticidiolect, not representative of “standard” Hidatsa. A minor issue, also evident in Harris andVoegelin (1939), is the uncertainty about what constitutes a “word” in Hidatsa. Compounding ofcontent words and combining lexical stems with grammatical and discourse particles seemsarbitrary in all of the published narratives.",[36]

6.1.1.8 -dóòre, -dóòres, -dóòreewa ‘assertion’The three assertive speech-act markers -dóòre, -dóòres, and -dóòreewa are used for asserting afact rather than making a simple declarative statement. The basic form is -dóòre, and the othertwo are synchronically analyzable as combinations of the assertive -dóòre plus the exclamative -wa and possibly the definite -s. The short e in -dóòres may indicate that what is synchronicallyperceived as the definite suffix -s may have its origin in a diachronic cluster that has caused thefinal vowel before it to shorten.6.1.1.8.1 -dóòre ‘assertive’The assertive suffix -dóòre is used when the speaker wants to assert a fact instead of simplystating it, as illustrated in (45)–(50).","[257, 258]"
"       In (75), a speculative speech-act with -dóòg is contrasted with an interrogative speech-actmarked with -ˀ.
(75)   a. Dáàbadoog.           I wonder what it could be.        < -dóòg SPEC
       b. Dáàbaˀ?              What is it?                       < -ˀ INTER       Speculative speech-acts are considered statements in some languages; however,morphological restrictions indicate that on structural grounds they have to be consideredquestions in Hidatsa. One of the indicators is that the speculative enclitic -dóòg must follow theinterrogative form of the future suffix (see 6.5.2). In example (76) the speculative enclitic ispreceded by the second person future suffix -rihi that is used only in questions. The samesentence would be ungrammatical if the speculative enclitic were preceded by the second personfuture tense suffix -ri, which is reserved for statements. Example (77) is a sentence from atraditional text where the first person interrogative future tense suffix -wihi is used instead of themore common first person future suffix -wi that is used only in statements.",[264]
"       Whenever aru- describes hypothetical events it is usually not interchangeable with thefuture suffixes without a change in meaning (verbs inflected for the future may have modalovertones, but they are not used to express hypthetical situations). The hypothetical aru- occursregularly in conditional clauses (see 17.4.2.1), as well as in conjunction with the abilitative -hahgá (see 6.6.1). Examples are (255)–(259).",[311]

      Are you (two) married?                     -- Yes, we are married. (lit. together with each other)           Other lexicalized reciprocal verbs, not related to kinship, are illustrated in (217). In manylexicalized combinations the prefix and the stem have become fused. Reciprocal verbs are alsoused in noun derivation, as illustrated in (218).

     There are several idiomatic ways to express the concept of kinship without making the specific relationship
explicit. In this example, magi-ida-nuxbáàga literally means ‘to possess each other as people’. Another idiomatic
way to express kinship ties between individuals is magi-ida-dáàba ‘to possess each other as something’, as in
Magiˀidadáàbaˀc. They are related to each other.",[206]
"       The focus particle -wa may follow the ergative suffix -rí even in interrogative pronouns,as in (23). Examples are rare in the corpus, but they are nevertheless possible.",[394]
"       At least two D-words (see Chaper 12) are used as exclamatory phrases. Neither one everoccurs with the interrogative speech-act marker -ˀ. Whereas the dabéè! what!? is identical to theD-word ‘to be who’, dáà! what!? is formed by dropping the final syllable from the D-worddáàba to be what.
   •   dáà!           what!? (used in response to someone bothering another person)
   •   dabéè!         who!? (used in response to someone knocking at the door)(28)   Héh!     --    Dáà!?

"           (2) Although future suffixes do not co-occur with commands (i.e., imperative andprecative speech-acts, see 6.1.3.1 and 6.1.3.2), statements and suggestions with imperativeillocutionary force can still be made. First and second person statement forms are used in66
     For some speakers, the sequence of the stem-final -wi and the first person future suffix -wi in maghuuwíwic is
more acceptable than the same sequence in other stems, possibly due to the accent on the stem-final -wi. This
sequence is attested in the sentence Hiraaciréˀ noogaréˀ aruˀágagahsi maghuuwíwic. I’ll try to write down Hidatsa
words.",[306]

16 AdpositionsThe range of concepts expressed in many other languages by adpositions and case endings iscommunicated in Hidatsa by a variety of morphological and lexical means, such as locativeverbal prefixes (see 4.4), other types of applicative prefixes (see 4.5), and a small number oflexical verbs that have become bleached in certain syntactic constructions, such as gúˀ to givesomething to somebody in benefactive constructions (see 17.5.2).","[513, 514]"
"       Whereas the population has clearly rebounded, the trend has been the reverse for thenumber of tribal language speakers. A hundred years ago virtually every Hidatsa was a speakerof the language, and most tribal members were also able to speak Mandan and English withvarying degrees of fluency. Gilbert Wilson made the following observation about the languagesituation in 1908:       The Hidatsa and Mandan have been so closely associated for two or three       generations that tribal barriers are nearly broken down, except perhaps in the matter       of language. A child is reckoned as of his mother’s tribe, and speaks his mother’s
                                                                                                   7
        language; and even husband and wife, if not of the same tribe, address each the        other in his own language. Most of the Hidatsa on the reservation understand        Mandan, and every Mandan understands Hidatsa. In council or preaching service,        an orator of either tribe speaks his mother’s tongue, and no interpreter is necessary.","[30, 31]"
       Examples (26a) and (26b) shed further light on the question. If Hiraaciréˀhaa in (26b)were a causative verb in a contemporaneous clause it would mean ‘to make sb speak Hidatsa’.,[496]
