"       Negative concord in non-standard dialects
        The clearest case of negative concord in English is found in non-standard dialects. This
        book is of course a grammar of Standard English, but the negative concord phenomenon
        is so widespread and salient that it deserves some mention here.
        In many dialects, ranging from Cockney (spoken in the East End of London, England) to
        African American Vernacular English (AAVE, formerly known as Black English Vernacular,
        spoken in segregated African American communities in the USA), the absolute negators no,
        no one, nothing, etc., are used in negative clauses where the standard dialect has the NPIs any,
        anyone, anything, etc.:
       [6]          non-standard                               standard
               i a. !He didn’t say nothin’.                 b. He didn’t say anything.
              ii a. !You gonna spend your whole life        b. Are you going to spend your whole life
                    [not trustin’ nobody]?                     [not trusting anybody]?
             iii a. !Nobody here didn’t point no gun at     b. Nobody here pointed any gun at
                    nobody.                                    anybody.
        Each clause contains just one semantic negation and in the standard versions it is marked by
        a single negator. In the non-standard versions, however, it is marked by verbal negation and
        also on all the existentially quantified elements in the clause. We accordingly have negative
        concord between the verb and these elements.
            Non-standard clauses with negative concord are characteristically homonymous with
        standard dialect clauses containing multiple semantic negation, such as [2v] and [3i] above.
        Standard He didn’t say nothing means “He did say something (it’s not true that he said
        nothing”). The bracketed clause of [6iia] could likewise be used in the standard dialect
        with the meaning “not being in a state of refusing to trust anyone”. In principle [6iiia]
        could be used in Standard English to express a meaning containing four semantic negations,
                                     § 7 Positive and negative polarity in responses and anaphora                     847
      though in practice of course it would be far too complex to process. There are, however, some
      constructions – such as imperative Don’t nobody move! – that cannot be used in the standard
      dialect to express multiple semantic negation.25
          There is an extremely widespread tendency among Standard English speakers to regard
      dialects with negative concord as ‘illogical’ and ‘inferior’. It is argued that by a rule of logic
      two negatives cancel each other out to make a positive. Thus just as It isn’t the case that she
      didn’t move (or She didn’t not move) is equivalent to She moved, it is argued that He didn’t say
      nothing is a double negative that can only mean “He said something” and hence should not
      be used to express the opposite of that meaning. But such an argument is completely invalid.
      The rule of logic that two negatives are equivalent to a positive applies to logical forms, not
      to grammatical forms. It applies to semantic negation, not to the grammatical markers of
      negation. And as far as the [a] examples of [6] are concerned, there is only a single semantic
      negation, so the rule of logic doesn’t apply: it is completely irrelevant.26 The pattern in the
      non-standard dialect is similar to the one found in the standard dialect of Italian, French,
      Spanish, Polish, Russian, and many other languages. For example, Italian non means “not”
      and nessuno means “nobody”, but the meaning of Non ti credo nessuno is “Nobody believes
      you”, not “Nobody doesn’t believe you”. Here again, then, we have two negative words marking
      a single semantic negation, just as we do in the non-standard English dialects. There is no
      more reason to condemn the latter as illogical than there is to condemn Italian, French, and
      so on. The difference between the [a] and [b] versions of [6] is a matter of grammar, not
      logic, and neither set can be regarded as intrinsically superior to the other.
          Despite its non-standard character every experienced user of English needs to be passively
      acquainted with the negative concord construction in order to be able to understand English
      in such ordinary contexts as film soundtracks, TV dramas, popular songs, and many everyday
      conversations. Those who claim that negative concord is evidence of ignorance and illiteracy
      are wrong; it is a regular and widespread feature of non-standard dialects of English across
      the world. Someone who thinks the song title I can’t get no satisfaction means “It is impossible
      for me to lack satisfaction” does not know English.277 Positive and negative polarity in responses and anaphora7.1 Answers to polar questions and comparable responses
 Yes and no answers
      Yes and no serve as markers of positive and negative polarity in answers to ques-
      tions. They may stand alone, or combine with a clause that expresses the answer more 25
    The same applies to the construction without + no (corresponding to standard without + any), as in !Give
    me a large cheeseburger without no onions. And also to the construction with negative concord between the
    verb and an approximate negator of degree, as in !I can’t hardly see (corresponding to standard I can hardly
    see).
 26
    Given that the term ‘double negative’ is strongly associated with the semantic rule whereby two negatives
    do cancel each other out, it is an unsatisfactory term for the negative concord construction. It is in any case
    inappropriate because there is no limitation to two, as we have seen.
 27
    Negative concord was common in Old English and became virtually obligatory in the Middle English period.
    Its decline in the standard written language in the early Modern period may have had much to do with a
    nascent prescriptive tradition and its conscious comparison of English with Latin. In the nineteenth century
    negative concord re-emerged as a literary mark of non-standard usage, the gap in the historical record almost
    certainly concealing a continuous but largely unrecorded tradition in many spoken dialects.

        explicitly:                                                     
       [7]    i a. A: Is this car yours?          B:
                                                     Yes (it is).         No (it isn’t).
                b. A: Isn’t this car yours?       B:                                                     
             ii a. A: He has gone, hasn’t he?     B:
                                                     Yes (he has).        No (he hasn’t).
                b. A: He hasn’t gone, has he?     B:
        The choice between yes and no depends simply on the polarity of the answer – not, for
        example, on agreement vs disagreement with what may be suggested by the question.
        Polar questions, especially negative ones, may be biased, indicating the questioner’s
        predisposition to think that one or other answer is the right one, but that has no bearing
        on the choice between yes and no. In [ib], for example, the appropriate response is yes
        if the car is B’s and no if it isn’t, irrespective of what A appears to expect is the case.
        Similarly with answers to tag questions, as in [ii].
            ∗
             Yes it isn’t and ∗No it is are thus ungrammatical as single clauses. In Yes it is and No
        it isn’t, the yes and no can be regarded as a special type of adjunct, a polarity adjunct,
        which agrees in polarity with the clause – a further case of polarity concord in English.
        The adjunct can also be placed at the end of the clause, with prosodic detachment: It is,
        yes and It isn’t, no. A response to [7i] with the form No, it’s Kim’s would not of course
        violate the polarity concord rule, because here we have not a single clause but a sequence
        of two, just as we do in No it’s not mine, it’s Kim’s.
            One respect in which the agreement vs disagreement factor is relevant concerns the
        choice between single-word and expanded responses. Suppose you ask Didn’t you post
        the letter after all, then?, indicating that you think I didn’t. If in fact I did post it, I would
        normally say Yes I did, not just Yes.","[866, 867, 868]"
"
      4 Polarity-sensitive items       A significant number of items – specific words, fixed or variable phrases, and idiomatic
       expressions – are polarity-sensitive, i.e. sensitive to the polarity of the environment in
       which they occur. Some items are admissible in negative environments but not normally
       in positive ones, while others occur in positive environments but generally not in negative
       ones:
       [1] i a. She doesn’t see him any longer.         b. She knows him already.
            ii a. ∗She sees him any longer.             b. ∗She doesn’t know him already.
       The aspectual adjunct any longer, for example, is acceptable in negative [ia] but not in
       positive [iia]. And conversely already is acceptable in positive [ib] but not in negative
       [iib] (ignoring the special case when it is used to contradict a previous utterance like
       [ib]). We need two pieces of new terminology for referring to these two kinds of item:
       [2]        i Items which prefer negative contexts over positive ones (such as any longer) are
                    negatively-oriented polarity-sensitive items, or NPIs.
                 ii Items which prefer positive contexts over negative ones (such as already) are
                    positively-oriented polarity-sensitive items, or PPIs.
       Non-affirmative contexts
           The reference to preferring negative contexts above is not incorrect, but it is only part of
           what needs to be said about the distribution of NPIs. The clauses in [1] are declarative
           main clauses. When we go beyond such data to consider interrogatives and certain types
           of subordinate clause we find that NPIs are not restricted to negatives:
       [3]        i Do you need me any longer?                                                        [interrogative]
                 ii If [you play any longer], you’ll get too tired.                                     [conditional]
       In [i] any longer occurs in an interrogative clause, while in [ii] it occurs in a subordinate
       clause functioning as protasis in a conditional construction. Although these clauses are
       positive, they have it in common with [1ia] that they are not used to assert a positive
       proposition: the proposition is questioned or merely conditionally entertained. This
       larger class of contexts that admit NPIs we call non-affirmative contexts – and those
       that exclude them, by contrast, are affirmative contexts.
          While NPIs are restricted to non-affirmative contexts, PPIs are not restricted to affir-
       mative contexts. Already, for example, is just as acceptable as any longer in interrogative
       and conditional constructions:
       [4] i Have they already left?                                                  [interrogative]
            ii If [he has already finished his work], we can leave immediately.         [conditional]
       Thus NPIs and PPIs do not occur in mutually exclusive sets of environments. They are
       mutually exclusive in declarative main clauses, but not always elsewhere.17      17
           NPIs are often referred to as ‘negative polarity items’. We avoid that term because it is open to misinter-
           pretation. NPIs are not themselves negative items: the NPI any, for example, is to be distinguished from
           the negative word no. Nor, as we have just emphasised, are NPIs restricted to negative contexts. Alternative
           terms found in the literature for our ‘affirmative’ and ‘non-affirmative’ are ‘assertive’ and ‘non-assertive’.

  Varying strength of the restrictions
   The NPI and PPI classes are by no means completely homogeneous: we find significant
   differences with respect to the distributional restrictions that apply. Much, for example,
   qualifies as an NPI by virtue of the unacceptability of clauses like ∗She loved him much,
   but it is not wholly excluded from affirmative contexts, as is evident from examples like
   She much regretted accepting their invitation. By contrast, the NPI at all (She did not love
   him at all ) is completely excluded from affirmative contexts. Similarly with PPIs. We
   have noted that already is quite acceptable in interrogatives, but pretty (“fairly”) is not:
   examples like ?Is she pretty happy? are of doubtful acceptability.
      It should also be borne in mind that in some cases the restrictions apply to one sense
   of an item but not to another. Thus any is non-affirmative in the sense it has in She didn’t
   make any changes or Did she make any changes?, but it also has a ‘free choice sense’ which
   is not polarity-sensitive, as in Take any card, or Any changes must be approved by the
   board (cf. Ch. 5, §7.5). Where it will help exposition we will use subscripts to distinguish
   between different senses, referring to the NPI any as ‘anyn ’.
      We will review the NPI and PPI classes in turn, and then examine correspondences
   between certain sets such as any (NPI), some (PPI), and no (negator). In the final sub-
   section we take up in more detail the question of what constitutes a non-affirmative
   context.","[842, 843]"

4.1 Negatively-oriented polarity-sensitive items (NPIs)
   The class of NPIs is quite large: it is not possible to give an exhaustive and definitive list.
   The most important ones, and a sample of the less important ones, are given in [5].
  [5]     i The any class of items: anyn , anybodyn , any longer, any more (AmE anymore),
            anyonen , anythingn , anywheren
         ii Miscellaneous grammatical items (mostly functioning as adjuncts): at all,
            eithern , evern , longn , much, till/until, toon , what(so)evern , yetn
        iii The modal auxiliaries dare and need
        iv A few lexical verbs: bother (+ infinitival), budge, faze
         v A large and probably open array of idioms, including: can abide/bear/stand,
            can be bothered, could care less,18 cost a bean, do a (single) thing (about . . . ),
            drink/touch a drop, eat a bite/thing, give a damn/fig, have a clue, have a penny
            (to one’s name) (BrE), have a red cent (AmE), hear/say a word/sound, hold a
            candle to, in ages, in donkey’s years, lift a finger (to help), mind a bit, move a
            muscle, say a word, see a thing, see a (living) soul, so much as (+ verb), take a
            (blind) bit of notice, would hurt a fly    We prefer ‘affirmative’ as it suggests the two most important features: positive in contrast to negative (an
    affirmative answer is a positive one) and declarative in contrast to interrogative (to affirm is to state, not to
    ask). ‘Non-affirmative’ can also be applied to items, providing an alternative term for NPIs, one which we
    have used in other chapters: in the present context we prefer NPI because we are dealing with the contrast
    between the two types of polarity-sensitive item.
 18
    For many American speakers the expression I couldn’t care less has lost its negation and the expression is
    now I could care less, still with the idiomatic meaning “I do not care at all”. For these speakers, care less is no
    longer an NPI; could care less has become an idiom with a negative meaning (approximately the opposite of
    its literal meaning). This is not an uncommon development; it is seen again in the development from I don’t
    know beans about it “I don’t know anything about it” to I know beans about it with the same meaning.
824        Chapter 9 Negation
             The following examples provide matching negative and positive examples in declar-
          ative main clauses for a sample of these.
          [6]      i a. Lee didn’t budge an inch.             b. ∗Lee budged an inch.
                  ii a. They can’t abide aniseed.             b. ∗They can abide aniseed.
                iii a. You needn’t come with us.              b. ∗You need come with us.
                 iv a. He didn’t wait so much as a week.      b. ∗He waited so much as a week.
                  v a. She hasn’t woken up yet.               b. ∗She has woken up yet.
                 vi a. I didn’t see a living soul.            b. # I saw a living soul.
                vii a. Joe hasn’t lifted a finger to help.    b. # Joe has lifted a finger to help.
          The positive versions are either ungrammatical or have a quite different and often
          bizarre literal meaning. Thus while [via] means that I didn’t see anyone, [vib] can
          only mean that in some way I actually saw a soul. Similarly, [viia] means that Joe did
          nothing to help, but [viib] can only mean that Joe’s help consisted literally of raising a
          finger.
             The subscripts attached to some of the items in [5] indicate that they have other
          senses in which they are not NPIs. Thus any and either have free choice senses (cf. Ch. 5,
          §§7.5, 7.7); either also has a non-NPI use as a marker of coordination (She’s arriving
          either on Monday or on Tuesday); ever and yet are similarly not NPIs in It will last for ever
          and He is yet to announce his decision; nor is long an NPI as an adjective (It lasted a long
          time).
             Toon means “very”, as opposed to the ordinary too meaning “excessively”: the differ-
          ence is seen in the well-known ambiguity of the testimonial writer’s I can’t recommend
          her too highly (“it’s impossible to overstate her good qualities” or, with toon , “I can give
          only a lukewarm recommendation”).
             What(so)ever is an NPI, with the meaning “at all”, only when functioning as an
          emphatic postmodifier in NP structure following any or no: There is no justification
          whatsoever for his behaviour; Have you any idea whatever of its value?
             The case with till and until is somewhat different. These are NPIs only when the clause
          has a punctual meaning (cf. Ch. 8, §7.3):
          [7]     i a. We won’t leave till six o’clock.       b. ∗We will leave till six o’clock.
                 ii a. We won’t publish it until next year.   b. ∗We will publish it until next year.
                iii a. We won’t stay until the end.           b. We will stay until the end.
          With verbs that are non-punctual and atelic, till and until are not polarity-sensitive,
          as shown in [iii]. But this is not a matter of a difference in the sense of till/until: it is
          simply that the polarity-sensitivity of these prepositions is limited to their occurrence
          with certain types of VP.","[843, 844]"
" Occurrence in contexts that are non-affirmative but positive
  Negatives constitute the most central type of non-affirmative context, but we have noted
  that NPIs can occur in certain types of positive clause, such as interrogatives – this is
  precisely why we talk in terms of non-affirmative contexts rather than simply negative
  ones. These positive non-affirmative contexts all have various semantic or pragmatic
  links to negatives. There are, however, differences among the NPIs with respect to how
828    Chapter 9 Negation
      strong or close these links need to be. Such differences can be illustrated by considering
      the non-affirmative context provided by closed interrogatives.
      NPIs in closed interrogatives
      Other things being equal, questions expressed by positive closed interrogatives are neutral
      as opposed to biased (cf. Ch. 10, §4.7). That is, they do not indicate any predisposition
      on the part of the questioner to think that one answer is more likely than the other. Now
      the inclusion of certain NPIs in the question has no effect on this neutrality, but with
      others bias towards a negative answer is introduced. Compare:
      [13] i a. Did they have a dog?               b. Did they have any money?
           ii a. Has she been to Paris?            b. Has she ever been to Paris?
          iii a. Did they help him?                b. Did they lift a finger to help him?
      The possible answers to [ia] may be expressed as Yes they did have a dog and No they
      didn’t have a dog: as we have said, there is no indication that one or other of these is
      expected to be the right answer. The answers to [ib] (omitting henceforth the yes and
      no) are They had some money and They didn’t have any money, and again the question
      is quite neutral. The inclusion of any in the question does not indicate that the answer
      containing any is expected. The absence of any indication that a positive answer is
      favoured is sufficient to license the NPI any: this is the default existential quantifier for
      polar questions. Similarly, both questions in [ii] are neutral as between the answers She
      has been to Paris (at some time) and She hasn’t (ever) been to Paris. This is not so in [iii].
      While [iiia] is of course neutral, [iiib] is not: it is oriented towards the negative answer
      They didn’t lift a finger to help him. The form of the question is such that the positive
      answer would be #They lifted a finger to help him, but since this (in the sense “They helped
      him”) is anomalous, the question doesn’t cater directly for a positive answer and hence
      indicates bias towards a negative one. The same applies to most of the other items in
      [5iv–v].
      Pragmatic nature of strength contrasts
      It is important to emphasise that the difference between (say) any or ever on the one
      hand and budge or lift a finger or in ages on the other is not a syntactic one. We are
      not saying that the former can occur in positive interrogatives while the latter cannot.
      The difference, rather, is pragmatic, having to do with the conditions under which they
      can be used in the expression of questions and with the interpretation of the resulting
      questions.
          Take, for example, the phrase in ages, as in I haven’t tasted truffles in ages. This is not
      easily contextualised in an interrogative: ?Have you tasted truffles in ages? would not be
      a highly appropriate way of simply asking someone whether it had been a very long
      time since they last tasted truffles. However, it might well be found in a context that
      was strongly biased in a direction suggesting a negative answer, as in [14i]. Similarly, the
      occurrence of the verb budge is almost entirely limited to negative clauses but one might
      encounter it in a biased context like [14ii].
      [14] i I don’t think you know anything about truffles or any other gourmet foods. Do you
              eat truffles regularly? Have you even so much as tasted truffles in ages?
           ii Did you budge an inch to let anyone else sit down? Not you; you just sat there hogging
              the whole couch as usual.

4.2 Positively-oriented polarity-sensitive items (PPIs)
   The class of PPIs is somewhat smaller than that of NPIs. The main members are listed in
   [15], while [16] provides a sample of positive examples contrasted with their inadmissible
   negative counterparts:

   As a PPI quite means “fairly”: with the sense “completely” quite is not polarity-sensitive
   (cf. That’s quite right ∼ That’s not quite right). The far that acts as a PPI modifies
   comparative expressions for the most part, and means roughly “considerably”; as a
   measure of distance it is not polarity sensitive (cf. They live / don’t live far away). I guess
   qualifies as a PPI where it serves to indicate the illocutionary force of the utterance: it is
   not polarity-sensitive when guess has its literal meaning (as in I don’t guess what’s in my
   presents, I wait to be surprised when I open them on Christmas Day).","[847, 848, 849]"
" Incongruent positioning
  A more significant consequence of the relatively weak scope contrasts found with auxil-
  iaries is that central adjuncts may be positioned ‘incongruently’, i.e. located syntactically
  in a way that does not match their semantic scope. Compare, for example:
 [14] i a. He undoubtedly must have misinterpreted her letter.                     [pre-verbal]
         b. He must undoubtedly have misinterpreted her letter.                      [post-aux]
         c. He must have undoubtedly misinterpreted her letter.                  [incongruent]
      ii a. The party will be long remembered.                                     [pre-verbal]
         b. The party will long be remembered.                                   [incongruent]
  In [i] undoubtedly has wide scope semantically: “It is undoubtedly the case that he must
  have misinterpreted her letter”. The preferred position is after must, i.e. post-auxiliary
  position in the topmost clause. The position before must is also completely acceptable.
  In version [ic], however, undoubtedly cannot be in the topmost clause, the one to which
  it belongs semantically, and hence can be regarded as incongruently positioned. Such
  clauses are encountered, but they are considerably less likely than the ones where there is
  congruence between the syntactic position and the semantic scope. In [ii] long belongs
  semantically with remember ; in version [iia] it belongs in the remember clause, while
784    Chapter 8 The clause: adjuncts
      in [iib] it is located syntactically in the be clause. Examples of this kind, where the
      adjunct occurs to the left of its expected position (rather than to the right, as in [ic]), are
      found with a very restricted range of adjuncts: compare, for example, The supply will be
      drastically reduced with ∗The supply will drastically be reduced.

786
       1 Introduction        A pair of clauses such as It is raining and It isn’t raining are said to differ in polarity. The
        first is a positive clause or a clause with positive polarity, while the second is a negative
        clause or a clause with negative polarity. For the most part positive represents the default
        polarity, in the sense that positive constructions are structurally and semantically simpler
        than negative ones. To a very large extent, therefore, a description of polarity is a matter
        of describing the special properties of negatives – and it is for this reason that we have
        called this chapter ‘Negation’ rather than ‘Polarity’.","[803, 804, 805, 806]"
"      Polarity-sensitive items
       A number of words or larger expressions are sensitive to polarity in that they favour
       negative over positive contexts or vice versa. Compare:
      [3]    i a. She doesn’t live here any longer.      b. ∗She lives here any longer.
            ii a. He was feeling somewhat sad.           b. ∗He wasn’t feeling somewhat sad.
       (We set aside the special case where [iib] is used to deny or contradict a prior assertion
       that he was feeling somewhat sad.) We say, then, that any longer is negatively oriented,
       and likewise (in certain senses at least) any, anyone, ever, determinative either, yet, at
       all, etc. Similarly somewhat is positively oriented, and also some, someone, pretty (in the
       degree sense), already, still, and others.
           It is not, however, simply a matter of negative vs positive contexts: any longer, for
       example, is found in interrogatives (Will you be needing me any longer ?) and the comple-
       ment of conditional if (If you stay any longer you will miss your bus). These clauses have
       it in common with negatives that they are not being used to make a positive assertion:
       we use the term non-affirmative to cover these (and certain other) clauses. Any longer
       thus occurs in non-affirmative contexts, and we can also say that any longer is a non-
       affirmative item, using this as an alternative to negatively-oriented polarity-sensitive
       item.",[80]
"4.1.2 Variation in the strength of the negative orientation
    We noted at the beginning of the discussion of polarity-sensitive items that there is
    variability with respect to the strength of their positive or negative orientation. As far as
    NPIs are concerned, there are two issues to be considered: (a) how strictly the restrictions
826      Chapter 9 Negation
        apply in negative clauses, and (b) the occurrence of these items in other kinds of non-
        affirmative context, such as interrogatives.","[845, 846]"
" Non-affirmative any
 The examples so far have had the quantified NP located before the verb, in subject func-
 tion. When we turn to postverbal NPs we find a third possible expression of existential
 quantification, any. Compare [4] above with the following:
 [5]    i a. He hadn’t eaten [all of the meat].     ≡ b. He hadn’t eaten [some of the meat].
       ii a. He hadn’t eaten [all of the meat].     ≡ b. He had eaten [none of the meat].
                                                      b . He hadn’t eaten [any of the meat].
 In [ia] the negative has scope over all (“It is not the case that he had eaten all of the
 meat”). This is equivalent to [ib], where some has scope over the negation: “There was
 some of the meat that he hadn’t eaten”. Version [ib] is much less likely than [ia], though
 the construction is certainly admissible (cf. I didn’t agree with some of the things he said ).
 Construction [iia], with the meaning “all of the meat had the property that he hadn’t eaten
360      Chapter 5 Nouns and noun phrases
        it”, is somewhat marginal and contrived: He hadn’t eaten all of the meat would generally be
        interpreted with the negative having wide scope, as in [ia]. Much more likely than [iia],
        then, is a version where negation has scope over existential quantification. And this can
        take either of two forms, one with the negative existential quantifier none, and one with
        a negative having scope over any. In the context of a wide scope negative, any is normally
        used instead of some to express existential quantification; we will use the asterisk notation
        for ∗He hadn’t eaten [some of the meat], with the proviso that it could be used in the special
        context of denying a previous utterance of He had eaten some of the meat or the like.
             Any can also be used in interrogative contexts, as in Had he eaten any of the meat? Here
        Had he eaten some of the meat? is also possible, but it suggests the questioner is disposed
        to think the answer may well be positive, whereas any is neutral, giving no indication of
        the speaker’s attitude to the possible answers (see Ch. 10, §4.7.4). However, any cannot
        substitute for some in He had eaten some of the meat : in the sense we are concerned
        with here, any is restricted to non-affirmative contexts (negatives, interrogatives, and
        various others, as described in Ch. 9, §4.4). This gives us three expressions of existential
        quantification: basic some, non-affirmative any, and negative no.","[379, 380]"
"2.3.2 Secondary negation with not following an auxiliary verb
    When not comes between two verbs the issue arises as to which of them it negates. If the
    first verb is a lexical verb or a secondary form of an auxiliary, not belongs clearly with
804       Chapter 9 Negation
         the following verb:
         [12] i She agreed [not to make a formal complaint].
              ii Jill’s instruction had been [not to take on any extra staff ].
         These are straightforward cases of secondary negation, with not located syntactically in
         the infinitival clause. The matrix clauses with primary verb-forms are positive, as evident
         from the reversed polarity tags didn’t she? and hadn’t it?, and other tests. Not can modify
         a preceding verb only if it is a primary form of an auxiliary (or imperative do). This is
         the case we need to consider further.      (a) Not immediately following a primary form of an auxiliary
          In this position not normally modifies the auxiliary verb and hence marks primary
          negation. This is so even when the auxiliary is not within the semantic scope of the
          negative:
         [13]    a. They must not read it.                  b. They need not read it.
         In [a] must has scope over not (“it is required that they not read it”), whereas in [b] not has
         scope over need (“it is not necessary for them to read it”) – cf. Ch. 3, §9.3.1. Nevertheless,
         not belongs syntactically in the matrix clause in both cases. Note, for example, that they
         take positive tags (must they?, need they?) – and that the analytic negation alternates with
         synthetic mustn’t and needn’t.
             There are, however, three exceptions to the general rule, illustrated in:
         [14] i Jill’s instruction was [not to take on any extra staff – in any circumstances].
              ii You can [not answer their letters]: you’re not legally required to respond.
             iii You can’t [not go with them].
         Not after be in its specifying sense
         Example [14i] can be interpreted like [12ii] without the perfect tense feature: “Jill’s
         instruction was that they not take on extra staff ”. The reversed polarity tag in this
         case would be wasn’t it?, for the main clause is positive. The construction illustrates
         the specifying use of be with a clause in the complement position that happens to be
         subjectless and negative. In [14i] it is impossible to replace was not by wasn’t and preserve
         the sense.
             However, it is perfectly possible for the not to follow be in sentences of superficially
         similar form and belong to the copular clause (if the copula is in a primary form):
         compare the attested sentence The sole purpose of the criminal law is not to amuse
         Mr Mortimer, which we understand as denying that the purpose of the criminal law
         is to amuse Mr Mortimer, not as affirming the bizarre claim that its purpose is to avoid
         amusing him. The construction is therefore potentially ambiguous. We included the
         prosodically detached in any circumstances in [14i] because it strongly favours the sec-
         ondary negation reading that we wish to illustrate.
         Can not and possibility of abstention
         The meaning of the first clause in [14ii] is “You are permitted not to answer their letters”,
         with can thus having scope over not. In this use, the not will characteristically be stressed
         and prosodically associated with answer rather than can by means of a very slight break
         separating it from the unstressed can. The fact that the modal has scope over not makes
         this semantically comparable to [13a], but syntactically it differs in that it has secondary
         negation rather than the primary negation of [13a]. This is evident from the fact that
                                                 § 2.3.2 Secondary negation with not and auxiliary verb                      805
      the reversed polarity tag for the can clause is can’t you? The meaning is quite different
      from that of You can’t/cannot answer their letters, which has primary negation in the can
      clause, and where the negative has scope over the modal (“It is not possible or permitted
      for you to answer their letters”).
         In [14ii], therefore – unlike [13a] – the syntax matches the semantics, with the not
      located in the subordinate, non-finite, clause. But this construction is fairly rare, and
      sounds somewhat contrived. It would not normally occur with modals other than can
      and may.
      Can’t not: secondary negation combined with primary negation
      In [14iii] (You can’t not go with them) the not follows a negative auxiliary: a verb cannot
      be negated twice, so the not can only belong in the non-finite clause. Note that the matrix
      clause is straightforwardly negative by virtue of the synthetic negation: the reversed
      polarity tag is can you?, just as it is for You can’t go with them. Syntactically, two negatives
      do not cancel each other out to make a positive: there are two negative elements in [14iii]
      but the main clause remains syntactically negative.
          In principle, this construction is possible with any auxiliary verb: I won’t not speak
      this time, I promise you. It can even be used, and has been attested, when the auxiliary
      is supportive do, to deny a negative assertion that has been made: I DIDN ’T not listen to
      you. Compare also imperative Don’t not go just because of me. These examples have one
      negative immediately within the scope of another, so that they cancel each other out
      semantically. I won’t not speak is truth-conditionally (but not rhetorically) equivalent
      to I will speak; I DIDN ’T not listen is similarly equivalent to I DID listen; Don’t not go is
      equivalent to Go. In most circumstances the simpler positive would be preferred, but
      special circumstances can make the use of mutually cancelling negatives preferable.8
          The can case in [14iii] differs from these in that the first negative has scope over can, so
      that You can’t not go with them is not equivalent to You can go with them; it is equivalent
      to You must go with them, but there is sufficient pragmatic difference between can’t not
      and must to motivate the use of both forms.(b) Not syntactically separated from an auxiliary
    Not can more readily mark secondary negation if it is adjacent to the secondary verb-
    form but not to the auxiliary. There are three distinct ways in which such a separation
    of the auxiliary from the negator can come about.
      Infinitival to preceding not
      The subordinator to can separate an auxiliary from not. One very clear case concerns
      infinitival to in the specifying be construction. Compare:
   [15]        a. Their aim is not to change things.                b Their aim is to not change things.","[823, 824, 825]"

1.2 An overview of negation types
  The framework in terms of which we shall describe negation involves four major con-
  trasts: verbal vs non-verbal, analytic vs synthetic, clausal vs subclausal, and ordinary
  vs metalinguistic. We illustrate in examples [3–6], and then discuss each distinction in
  turn.

             ii a. We were friends at no time.                    b. We were friends in no time.
         [6]       ordinary                                          metalinguistic
              i a. She didn’t have lunch with my old              b. She didn’t have lunch with your ‘old
                   man: he couldn’t make it.                         man’: she had lunch with your father.
             ii a. Max hasn’t got four children: he’s             b. Max hasn’t got four children: he’s
                   got three.                                        got five.
         The first two contrasts have to do with the expression of negation, i.e. with matters of
         form, while the second two have to do with meaning, i.e. with the interpretation of
         negation.      (a) Verbal vs non-verbal negation
          In verbal negation the marker of negation is grammatically associated with the verb,
          the head of the clause, whereas in non-verbal negation it is associated with a dependent
          of the verb: an adjunct in [3ib], object in [3iib]. This distinction is needed to account for
          the occurrence of the auxiliary do, which is required in the [a] examples of [3], but not
          the [b] ones. Within verbal negation we then distinguish three subcategories:
         [7]     i a. You didn’t hurt him.                  b. You aren’t tactless.             [primary]
                ii a. Don’t hurt him.                       b. Don’t be tactless.             [imperative]
               iii a. It’s important not to bend it.        b. It’s important not to be seen. [secondary]
         In primary verbal negation the negative marker is associated with a primary verb-form:
         here do is required if there is no other auxiliary verb. In imperative verbal negation
         do is required even if the corresponding positive does contain an auxiliary verb, as in
         [iib]. The third category comprises all constructions other than imperatives containing a
         secondary verb-form: infinitivals, subjunctives, gerund–participials, and so on. Auxiliary
         do does not occur in these constructions. We label this category secondary with the
         understanding that this is a shorthand for ‘non-imperative secondary’.      (b) Analytic vs synthetic negation
          Analytic negation is marked by words whose sole syntactic function is to mark negation,
          i.e. not and also no in the use in which it contrasts with yes, as in answering a question,
          for example. Synthetic negation is marked by words which have some other function as
          well. Synthetic verbal negation is marked inflectionally, by negative verb-forms. Synthetic
          non-verbal negation is marked by elements of three kinds:

                                                          § 1.2 An overview of negation types      789
   We treat examples like He had no money as cases of synthetic negation because no
   combines the function of marking negation with that of determiner in NP structure.
   As a determiner, it expresses quantification. These two functions are separated in the
   analytic negative He did not have any money.
      The distinction between the absolute and approximate negators is illustrated in:
   [9] a. None of them supported her.                     b. Few of them supported her.
   In [a] the number of them who supported her is zero, whereas in [b] it merely approx-
   imates to zero – it is located towards the bottom of the scale, in the area that contains
   zero. Example [b] in fact has a positive implicature – that some of them supported her.
   It nevertheless has important features in common with [a] that motivate its analysis as
   negative – note, for example, that the reversed polarity tag for both examples is did they?
       The affixal negators are prefixes (un·happy) or suffixes (care·less). The main discussion
   of these is in Ch. 19, §5.5, but we look briefly in §3.4 below at the relation between verbal
   and affixal negation – at the contrast, for example, between They are not common and
   They are uncommon.(c) Clausal vs subclausal negation
    This distinction relates to the tests for polarity given in §1.1: as made clear there, these
    are tests that differentiate between negative and positive clauses. Clausal negation is
    therefore negation that yields a negative clause, whereas subclausal negation does not
    make the whole clause negative. The distinction is seen very clearly when we apply the
    tests to such a pair of examples as those in [5ii]:
   [10] i a. We were friends at no time,                  b. ∗We were friends in no time,
              not even when we were at school.                 not even within a few days.
        ii a. We were friends at no time,                 b. We were friends in no time,
              and neither were our brothers.                  and so were our brothers.
       iii a. We were friends at no time,                 b. We were friends in no time,
              were we?                                        weren’t we?
       iv a. At no time were we friends.                  b. ∗In no time were we friends.
   The tests show clearly that We were friends at no time has clausal negation while We were
   friends in no time has subclausal negation. The former allows a not even continuation,
   takes neither as a following connective adjunct, takes a positive tag, and requires inver-
   sion when at no time is placed in prenuclear position. Conversely, We were friends in no
   time does not permit not even, takes so as connective adjunct, takes a negative tag, and
   does not have inversion when in no time is preposed (the form required is In no time we
   were friends).
       One further difference is that the example with at no time has an equivalent with
   verbal negation whereas the one with in no time does not:
   [11]   a. We weren’t friends at any time.              b. ∗We weren’t friends in any time.
   The negation in in no time thus relates only to the phrase, which means “in a very short
   period of time”: it doesn’t negate the clause as a whole.
      Affixal negation is always subclausal. Compare, for example:
   [12] i These terms aren’t negotiable, are they?                    [verbal negation: clausal]
        ii These terms are non-negotiable, aren’t they?           [affixal negation: subclausal]
790         Chapter 9 Negation
          Clausal negation is a matter of syntax, while affixal negation is purely morphological.
          For the rest we take clausal negation as the default case, and survey in §3.2.2 the main
          places where negative markers other than affixes yield subclausal negation.       (d) Ordinary vs metalinguistic negation.
           Consider finally the contrast between the examples in [6]. In [ia] (She didn’t have lunch
           with my old man: he couldn’t make it) the negative indicates that it is not the case, not
           true, that she had lunch with my old man. But that is not how the negative is understood
           in (the intended interpretation of) [ib]: She didn’t have lunch with your ‘old man’: she
           had lunch with your father. The latter would normally be used in a context where you
           had said She had lunch with my old man. In uttering [ib] I am not disputing the truth
           of what you said but rejecting the formulation you used: I’m objecting to your referring
           to your father as your ‘old man’. Similarly, She doesn’t live in a /kæsl/, she lives in a /kɑsl/
           might be used to reject your pronunciation of castle.
               An important case of metalinguistic negation is illustrated in [6iib], Max hasn’t got
           four children, he’s got five: here it is used to deny an implicature. We argued in Ch. 5, §5.2,
           that Max has four children entails that he has no less than four and implicates that he
           has no more than four. Max hasn’t got four children: he’s got three ([6iia]) is thus ordinary
           negation. It denies the entailment of the positive, i.e. it indicates that Max has got four
           children is false. Max hasn’t got four children, he’s got five ([iib]) denies the implicature. It
           is not saying that Max has got four children is false, and hence is not ordinary negation.
           Again I would typically use the metalinguistic negative in a context where you had just
           said that Max has four children: I am correcting what you said not because it is false but
           because it doesn’t go far enough. It is metalinguistic in the sense that it is saying that four
           was the wrong word to use (among those yielding a true statement).","[807, 808, 809, 810]"

      1.1 Tests for clause polarity
        Negation is marked by words (not, no, never, etc.) or by affixes (e.g. ·n’t, un·), but very
        often the effect of adding a negative word or the suffix ·n’t is to make the whole clause
        negative. Hence the distinction drawn above between It is raining and It isn’t raining as
        positive and negative clauses. We will therefore begin by surveying four useful diagnostic
        tests for determining the syntactic polarity of a clause. They are illustrated in [1]:
        [1]          negative clause                               positive clause
                                                                    ∗
                i a. He didn’t read it, not even the abstract.   b. He read it, not even the abstract.
               ii a. He didn’t read it; neither/nor did I.       b. Ed read it; so did I.
              iii a. Ed didn’t read it, did he?                  b. Ed read it, didn’t he?
              iv a. Not once did Ed read it.                     b. After lunch Ed read it.
        Single underlining marks the clauses whose polarity is indicated in the headings, while
        the double underlining in [i–iii] marks the crucial feature of the diagnostic.",[806]
"
      4.3 Polar questions
        Answers to polar questions
            A polar question has as answers a pair of polar opposites, positive and negative. The
            answers to Is it ready? are It is ready and It is not ready (or equivalently Yes and No, or Yes,
            it is and No, it’s not, and so on). The propositional content of one answer is expressed in
            the question itself, and that of the other is obtained by reversing the polarity.5
                Usually it is the positive that is expressed in the question, but it can also be the negative,
            as in the biased question Isn’t it ready?
            Choice between Yes and No determined by answer
            Yes and no are used in positive and negative answers respectively: the choice between
            them is determined by the polarity of the answer, with the polarity of the question
            being irrelevant. Thus Yes, it is and No, it’s not are answers to both Is it ready? and Isn’t it
            ready? Yes on its own, however, is relatively unlikely to be used as a response to a negative
            question.",[888]
" Polarity-sensitive items
  If adjuncts have much in common, semantically and syntactically, with interrogatives.
  If Jill is here, she’s in her office, for example, implicitly raises the question of whether Jill
  is here, but leaves the question unanswered. And if sanctions polarity-sensitive items in
  very much the same way as interrogatives.
 [23] i a. It will give us an advantage if they are already here.
         b. I’ll be surprised if they are here yet.
      ii a. If anyone has a solution to this problem, please let me know.
         b. If someone has a solution to this problem, please let me know.
 Already is positively-oriented, yet negatively-oriented and both can occur in interroga-
 tives: Are they already here?, Are they here yet? Example [ia] is oriented towards a positive
 answer (it’s their being here already that will give us the advantage), while [ib] is ori-
 ented towards the negative: I’ll be surprised suggests an expectation that they are not here
 yet. The difference between [iia] with non-affirmative anyone and [iib] with affirmative
 someone matches that between Has anyone a solution to this problem? and Has someone a
 solution to this problem?, where the latter suggests a slightly greater inclination to think
 that the answer could be positive.
    Factors of this kind account for the differences in:
 [24] i If you are at all worried about the project, don’t get involved.
       ii ?If you were at all worried about the project, why didn’t you let me know?
      iii ?If you improve your performance at all, we give you a bonus.
  Example [i] readily accepts non-affirmative at all: you may well not be worried at all.
  But the reproachful why didn’t you in [ii] conveys that I think you were worried (and
  should have let me know), and so at all is here infelicitous. Similarly in [iii] we’re making
  a conditional offer, and this suggests a positive orientation to the satisfaction of the
  condition.
746         Chapter 8 The clause: adjuncts
      14.1.3 If in combination with only and even
          Only if
           [25] i I’ll cook only if you clean up.
                ii Students are admitted into the second year only if they achieve a grade of 5 or higher
                   in the first year.
               iii She cycled to work only if it was fine.
           An if phrase is often the scopal focus of only, which as usual may immediately precede
           (as in these examples) or be separated (I’ll only cook if you clean up, etc.). In the former
           case, the whole only if phrase may precede the apodosis (Only if you clean up will I cook),
           but the order shown in [25] is much more usual, and we will therefore describe the
           meaning with reference to the schematic representation Q only if P.
           [26] i Invariant meaning: The truth values of P and Q are related in such a way as to
                   exclude the combination where P is false and Q is true.
                ii Sufficient condition implicature: Q if P.
           Invariant meaning: excludes combination of false P and true Q
           The Q only if P construction rules out the case where P is false and Q true. Thus [25i]
           rules out the case where I cook and you don’t clean up; [ii] rules out that where students
           are admitted into second year without achieving a grade of 5 or higher in the first year;
           [iii] rules out that where she cycled to work in bad weather. P thus expresses a necessary
           condition, a condition that must be satisfied if Q is to be true.
           Sufficient condition implicature: Q if P
           Besides expressing a necessary condition, P is characteristically taken to express a suf-
           ficient condition, one whose satisfaction is all that is required for Q to be true. The
           natural interpretation of [25i] is that I’m offering to cook provided you agree to clean
           up. Similarly we will assume from [ii] that any student obtaining a first-year grade of
           5 will be admitted into second year. And [iii] conveys that she did cycle to work when
           it was fine. But it is clear that Q only if P does not actually entail Q if P. Consider, for
           example:
           [27] i A will is valid only if it has been signed in the presence of two witnesses.
                ii You are entitled to a pension only if you are a permanent resident.
               iii The red light goes on only if the blue light is on, but it doesn’t go on if the green light
                   is also on.
           It is common knowledge that there are other conditions on the validity of a will than
           the one expressed in [i] – for example, the testator must be of sound mind and not
           acting under duress. Example [ii] omits the obvious condition on pensions concerning
           age (or health): we don’t assume that all permanent residents are currently entitled to a
           pension. And in [iii] the second coordinate adds a second condition but is not judged
           to be inconsistent with the first. To make explicit that P expresses a condition that is
           both necessary and sufficient we need to combine if and only if (or use some equivalent
           formulation): I will accept your proposal if and only if my lawyer assures me that it is
           legal.
                                                  § 14.1.3 If in combination with only and even          747
  Logical equivalences
  By virtue of the invariant meaning [26i], Q only if P is equivalent to If not-P (then) not-Q
  and If Q (then) P. Compare:
 [28] i You qualify for a rebate only if your annual income is less than $70,000.
      ii If your annual income is not less than $70,000 you don’t qualify for a rebate.
     iii If you qualify for a rebate your annual income is less than $70,000.
  The third version, however, will again often be pragmatically very different from the
  others. Compare the following examples with modal will:
 [29]       a. I’ll do it only if you pay me.    b. You’ll pay me if I do it.
  Version [a] will tend to be construed as giving you a choice as to whether you pay me or
  not (though if you don’t I won’t do it). Version [b], by contrast, would then sound very
  peremptory: I’m not giving you a choice, but telling you.","[765, 766, 767]"
"       Responses to other kinds of speech act
        Yes and no are used in response to statements in a similar but not identical way:
       [8]    i A: She did very well.             B: Yes (she did ).      No she didn’t.
             ii A: She didn’t do very well.       B: Yes she did.         No (she didn’t).
        In [i] the disagreeing negative response would not normally be reduced to No, and in
        [ii] the disagreeing positive answer could not be reduced to yes. It is in fact here possible
        to say yes to express agreement with the negative statement: “Yes, you’re right”.
            Following directives, yes and no can be used to express intention to comply with a
        positive and negative directive. No is also used to indicate refusal to comply with a positive
        one, but yes is not an idiomatic way of refusing to comply with a negative directive:
       [9]     i A: Remember to lock up.          B: Yes (I will ).
              ii A: Don’t forget to lock up.      B: No (I won’t).
             iii A: Tell me who did it.           B: No (I won’t).
             iv A: Don’t tell them I did it.      B: ?Yes I will.
        In [iv] B would more likely say just I will (tell them), or words to that effect. With
        directives expressed by certain kinds of interrogative clause (a type of indirect speech
        act, in the sense of Ch. 10, §9.6.1), a response may reflect the literal question meaning
        or the indirect directive meaning. Thus in response to Would you mind coming a little
        earlier next week, I might respond No of course not, I’ll come around six (“No of course
        I wouldn’t mind”), or Yes of course, I’ll come around six (“Yes of course I’ll come a
        little earlier”).
                                                                                § 7.2 Anaphoric so and not          849
  Idiomatic negative answers with not and no
      There are a number of idiomatic phrases that express an emphatic negative response to
      a question or other speech act. Some have not, others the determinative no:
  [10] i Not for all the tea in China!                Not likely!              Not on a bet! (AmE)
          Not in a million years!                     Not on your life!        Not on your nelly! (BrE)
       ii No fear!                                    No chance!               No way! 28
7.2 Anaphoric so and not
      With predicates that take so as the anaphoric pro-form for a positive clausal complement,
      not is used as a pro-form for a negative (cf. Ch. 17, §7.7.2). We illustrate with answers to
      questions, but they occur more widely than this.
  [11]        question                         positive answer                 negative answer
                                              I believe/think so.              I believe/think not.
              Are they reliable?              I was told so.                   I was told not.
                                              It seems so.                     It seems not.
      Not (like so) is here functioning as complement and marks non-verbal negation: it is not
      modifying the verb.
         What accompanies the pro-form need not be a full matrix clause; a preposed AdvP
      functioning as clause adjunct will serve as well:                                              Most definitely so.
  [12]                                        Apparently so.                   Apparently not.
              Is the city beautiful?
                                                                               Most definitely not.
      Other adjuncts such as PPs are permitted with not but not so:
                                              ∗
  [13]                                         On the whole so.                On the whole not.
                                              ∗
               Does it rain much?              So in the winter.               Not in the winter.
                                              ∗
                                               Usually so this early.          Usually not this early.
         Not can also introduce anaphorically reduced clauses used in response to other types
      of speech act or following a negative clause:
  [14] i A: I think you should leave now.      B: Not without my money.
       ii I won’t go, not even if they beg me.
      iii There aren’t many wild rhinoceroses left, not in Africa or in Asia.
      Not is here understood respectively as “I won’t leave”, “I won’t go”, and “there aren’t many
      rhinoceroses left”.
 28
      No way can also be integrated into clause structure as an emphatic negator, as in No way is that a diamond!
      The original manner meaning has here been bleached away, so that we understand “That is emphatically not
      a diamond”.

1 Type as a grammatical system of the clause The five major categories
  Clause type is the grammatical system whose five major terms are illustrated in:
 [1]     i You are generous.                                                     [declarative]
        ii Are you generous?                                            [closed interrogative]
       iii How generous are you?                                         [open interrogative]
       iv How generous you are!                                                 [exclamative]
        v Be generous.                                                           [imperative]
 Characteristic use and general definitions
  Each of the categories is associated with a characteristic use as follows:
 [2]       clause type              characteristic use
         i declarative              statement
        ii closed interrogative     closed question
       iii open interrogative       open question
       iv exclamative               exclamatory statement
        v imperative                directive
  A closed question is one with a closed set of answers: for example, the answers to [1ii] are
  just “Yes” and “No”. By contrast, [1iii] has any number of possible answers, and is therefore
  an open question; similarly with Who attended the meeting?, and so on. In [2iv] we have
  used ‘exclamatory statement’ rather than the more familiar ‘exclamation’, because an
  exclamatory meaning can be added to any of the use categories, but the special syntactic
  construction shown in [1iv] is associated just with a particular kind of statement. For
  example, the exclamatory command Get the hell out of here or the exclamatory question
  What on earth are you doing? belong syntactically with [1v] and [1iii] respectively, not
  with [1iv]. ‘Directive’ in [2v] is a cover term for requests, commands, instructions, and
  the like; traditional grammars tend to use the term ‘command’, but this is far too narrow
  and specific for our purposes if understood in its everyday sense.
     The correlation shown in [2] provides the basis for general definitions of the clause
  type categories:
 [3]      Imperative clause is a grammatically distinct class of clause whose members are
          characteristically used to issue directives.
  And similarly for the others.
854         Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
       Complex relation between form and meaning
           We have spoken of ‘characteristic’ use because, as is so often the case, the correlation
           between major categories of grammatical form and categories of meaning or use is by
           no means one-to-one. Compare, for example:
       [4]                                                                    clause type                    use
                  i Passengers are requested to remain seated.                declarative                    directive
                 ii Would you mind opening the door for me.                   closed interrogative           directive
                iii Sleep well.                                               imperative                     wish
           Examples [i] and [ii] illustrate conventional ways of expressing a polite request, a kind of
           directive, but syntactically they belong to the same structural class as You are generous and
           Are you generous? respectively. And though [iii] belongs syntactically with Be generous it
           is not used to tell or ask somebody to do something, but to express a wish. Numerous
           further examples of this and other kinds will emerge during the course of the chapter. It is
           essential therefore to maintain a sharp conceptual distinction between the grammatical
           clause types and the categories of meaning or use – between declarative and statement,
           imperative and directive, and so on. The situation is closely parallel to that which obtains
           in the area of tense (form) and time (meaning), but whereas it is standard practice for
           grammars to distinguish terminologically between tense and time, many use ‘question’
           both for form (our ‘interrogative’) and for meaning. Again we emphasise, therefore, that
           interrogatives aren’t always used as questions, and not all questions have the syntactic
           form of interrogatives.","[868, 869, 870, 871, 872, 873, 874]"
"  Scope of negation
   The negatives in the [b] examples in [16] have scope over the PPI. In general, PPIs are
   admissible with negatives over which they themselves have scope: this does not count as
   a non-affirmative context for the item concerned. Compare, for example:
   [17] i I would rather not commit myself.
        ii Far more of them didn’t understand it than did.
       iii We already can’t afford any luxuries: how will we deal with this new expense?
       iv I still don’t know how she did it.
        v I didn’t understand some of the points she was trying to make.
       vi I’m afraid I couldn’t stand several of her friends.
   In [i] the not belongs in the subordinate clause: it modifies commit, not would rather.
   Example [ii] says that the number of those who didn’t understand was far greater than
   the number of those who did. Example [iii] says that the state of affairs wherein we can’t
   afford luxuries already obtains. In [iv] the state of my not knowing how she did it still
   obtains. And in [v] some of the points she was trying to make had the property that
   I didn’t understand them. Similarly [vi] says there were several of her friends whom I
   couldn’t stand, not that the number whom I could stand was less than several. In all of
   these, then, the PPI itself is not affected by the negation and hence perfectly admissible.
830      Chapter 9 Negation
           The connective adjuncts so, too, and as well, however, cannot even take scope over
        negation:
       [18] i ∗Kim didn’t see it, and so didn’t Pat.
            ii ∗Kim didn’t see it, and Pat didn’t see it too / as well.
        This of course is why we were able to include these items in our tests for clause polarity.
        There is, however, an appreciable difference in the strength of the restriction: [i] is
        completely ungrammatical, whereas [ii] might be regarded as marginally acceptable by
        some speakers provided the final adjunct is prosodically set off to some extent.","[849, 850]"
"
      6.1 Multiple semantic negation within a single clause
      (a) Constructions where the first negation has scope over existential quantification
        [2]        i None of them had no redeeming features.
                  ii No one, surely, has never experienced such temptation.
                 iii Never before had no one nominated for the position.
                 iv Neither investigator had no financial interest in the company.
                  v No one didn’t consider it a retrograde move.
            By virtue of the relation between existential and universal quantification (see Ch. 5,
            §5.1) these are all equivalent to positive clauses with universal quantification: All of
            them had some redeeming features; Everyone, surely, has at some time experienced such
            temptation; Before, someone had always nominated for the position; Both investigators had
            some financial interest in the company; Everyone considered it a retrograde move. Note
            that it is the first negative that is replaced by a universally quantified counterpart in the
            paraphrase. Thus in [ii] no one precedes never, so we have everyone and at some time,
            but in [iii] never precedes no one, so we have always and someone (even though in the
            positive they do not occur in that order).24
                The positive versions are of course easier to process and represent the default way
            of expressing the meanings concerned. The more complex forms would thus typically
            need some special motivation, such as contrast. In [2iii], for example, we are concerned
            with an occasion on which no one had nominated for the position in question, and
            [iii] contrasts this occasion with all previous ones of the relevant kind. Such contexts of
            contrast will often lead to one or other of the negative markers being stressed.
                As far as the syntax is concerned, only one of the negators can mark clausal negation.
            The clauses in [2] are all negative and behave with respect to the tests for polarity just like
            clauses with a single negative. Compare, for example, None of them had any redeeming
            features, did they? and None of them had no redeeming features, did they?",[864]
" Any in determiner function
  For any we have a major distinction between two uses that we call non-affirmative (anyn )
  and free choice (anyf ).
  (a) Non-affirmative anyn
  Anyn has essentially the same sense as some in its basic non-proportional and propor-
  tional uses, but is restricted to non-affirmative contexts – prototypically either negative
  declaratives or else interrogatives.
     The non-proportional use is seen in:
 [32] i There aren’t any letters for you.                                             [plural]
      ii We don’t need any sugar.                                                [non-count]
     iii I haven’t got any job lined up for you today, I’m afraid.            [count singular]
  The count singular case is relatively uncommon. We noted above that the indefinite arti-
  cle a is generally preferred over some for count singulars, and since a – unlike some – is not
382         Chapter 5 Nouns and noun phrases
           polarity-sensitive, that preference carries over to non-affirmative contexts. Thus I would
           normally say, for example, I haven’t got a car rather than I haven’t got any car. The latter
           cannot be ruled out, but it needs some special context, as when I make an emphatic riposte
           to someone who thinks I do have a car. Anyn is found with various singular abstract nouns
           where the distinction between count and non-count is somewhat blurred: They didn’t
           make any attempt to justify their decision (cf. They didn’t make an attempt / much attempt
           to justify their decision, with count and non-count interpretations respectively). In gen-
           eral, the choice between singular and plural with count nouns is determined by the same
           factors as apply with no: see §7.8. Note, for example, that one would normally say They
           haven’t got any children rather than They haven’t got any child.
               The proportional use of anyn is illustrated in:
           [33] i I don’t think any people left early.                                                     [plural]
                ii I don’t think any candidate expressed a view on this issue.                     [count singular]
               iii I don’t think any cheese is made from goat’s milk.                                 [non-count]
           The count singular case is less restricted here than in the non-proportional use, reflecting
           the fact that proportional some is also found with count singulars.
              Anyn is usually but by no means always unstressed. It can be stressed, for example,
           when it is the focus of negation: I don’t think ANY people left early. The negative orientation
           of anyn can be reinforced by the polarity-sensitive at all or whatever: We hadn’t made
           any progress at all / whatever.
           (b) Free choice anyf
           [34] i Any computers with defective keyboards should be returned.                               [plural]
                ii Any policeman will be able to tell you.                                         [count singular]
               iii Any remaining dirt will have to be removed.                                        [non-count]
           Anyf occurs with all three of the main kinds of head: plural, count singular, and non-
           count. It indicates that there is a free choice: an arbitary member (or subquantity) can
           be selected from the set (or quantity) denoted by the head and the predication property
           will apply to it. In [ii], for example, there is a free choice as to which policeman can be
           selected, but no matter which policeman it is, that policeman will be able to tell you. Anyf
           implicates that the free choice will only have to be made once, but this implicature can
           be cancelled. In [ii], since the first policeman selected will normally provide the required
           information, it will not be necessary to ask another one. However, in [i] the modal should
           imposes an obligation to apply the free choice until all defective computers are selected.
           Note that this obligation to return all defective computers is not related to the plurality
           of the nominal: Any computer with a defective keyboard should be returned implicates the
           same obligation.
               For these reasons anyf bears some resemblance to the universal quantifier all: compare
           All computers with defective keyboards should be returned.23 It is clear, however, that anyf
           does not mean “all”. There is, for example, a clear difference between Come on, anyone,
           join me up here on the stage, which asks for one volunteer to come up on stage, and Come
           on, everyone, join me up here on the stage, which asks less prudently for everyone in the
           audience to come up on stage.","[401, 402]"
"      4.1.1 NPIs vs negative idioms
          It will be noted that we have not included the word not or the inflectional suffix ·n’t
          in any of the NPIs. Thus we have listed long and could care less rather than not long or
          couldn’t care less. The negative element is part of the context which admits the NPI, not
          part of the NPI itself. There are in fact a number of idioms which do include negators
          as subparts, and they behave quite differently from NPIs. Idioms of the type in question
          include the underlined phrases in [8]: not half bad “quite good”, like nothing better “be
          pleased”, and stop at nothing “use any means necessary”.
                                     § 4.1.2 Variation in the strength of the negative orientation         825
    [8]     i I tasted the caviar, and it was not half bad.
           ii I would like nothing better than to attend the dinner.
          iii George will stop at nothing to get that job.
    Notice that the positive counterparts are not available, or not available with related meanings:
    half bad, like something better, and stop at something are not positive counterparts to the
    expressions given in [8].
       These idioms contain a negator, but do not negate the clause they belong to. NPIs, by
    contrast, do not contain a negator, but require that one of a certain range of properties be
    present in the context in which they appear in order that it be non-affirmative: negation is
    just one of the properties of this kind. The difference between the behaviour of negative-
    containing idioms and that of NPIs is seen when we contrast, say, the distribution of not for
    long with that of not half bad. At first they might seem parallel:
    [9]    i a. They laughed, but not for long.            b. It was salty, but not half bad.
          ii a. It wasn’t for long.                        b. It wasn’t half bad.
    But the parallel rapidly breaks down:
    [10] i a. They didn’t laugh loudly or for long.        b. # It wasn’t too salty or half bad.
         ii a. No one laughs for long.                     b. # Nothing was half bad.
        iii a. Few people laughed for long.                b. # Few portions were half bad.
        iv a. I doubt that he’ll laugh for long.           b. # I doubt that it was half bad.
         v a. Did they laugh for long?                     b. # Was it half bad?
        vi a. I’ll leave if they laugh for long.           b. # I’ll leave if it’s half bad.
    The ‘# ’ in the [b] cases indicates that the expected idiomatic meaning is not present (though
    some other meaning might be possible, e.g. with half bad meaning “50% putrescent”). As
    we see, for long does not have to be preceded by not or a negative auxiliary; it merely has to
    be in some sort of non-affirmative context. The situation with not half bad is quite different.
    Immediately before half bad must be either not or a negative auxiliary; merely having half bad
    in some non-affirmative context is not sufficient for it to count as an instance of the idiom
    not half bad.
        The idiom like nothing better is likewise restricted to combinations involving those three
    words: [8ii] can be paraphrased by There’s nothing I’d like better than to attend the dinner,
    but not by I wouldn’t like anything better than to attend the dinner. The latter has only the
    literal meaning that nothing (not even winning a national lottery) tops dinner attendance
    on my preference list, whereas [8ii] is just a polite form of words carrying no such literal
    entailment.
        Stop at nothing also exists only in negative form. ?George will stop at something would have

"       Interrogatives
        Most PPIs can occur in interrogative clauses:
       [21]          negative interrogative                        positive interrogative
                i a. Wouldn’t you rather stay here?             b. Would you rather stay here?
               ii a. Didn’t Kim see it too / as well?           b. Did Kim see it too / as well?
              iii a. Isn’t he pretty stupid?                    b. ?Is he pretty stupid?
              iv a. Aren’t they still/already in London?        b. Are they still/already in London?
               v a. Isn’t there something wrong with it?        b. Is there something wrong with it?
        Negative interrogatives are normally used to ask biased rather than neutral questions,
        and when there is bias towards a positive answer this is sufficient to admit the PPIs
        even though they are in the scope of the negative. Illocutionary I guess and connective
        so, however, are restricted to declaratives. For the rest, the degree adverbs pretty, fairly,
        quitep occur significantly less readily in positive interrogatives than the others.
                                    § 4.3 Correspondences between PPIs, NPIs, and negators           831
4.3 Correspondences between PPIs, NPIs, and negators
   There is an important relationship between some, anyn , and no illustrated in such
   sets as:
   [22] i Kim made some mistakes.                                                       [positive]
         ii Kim didn’t make any mistakes.                        [negative with verbal negation]
        iii Kim made no mistakes.                           [negative with non-verbal negation]
   In [ii–iii] the existential quantification falls within the scope of the negation, and (with
   the provisos mentioned in §4.2 above) some cannot occur in this environment. Thus
   [ii–iii] are negations of [i], differing in that the negation is expressed separately from the
   quantification in [ii] but not in [iii].
       Broadly similar relationships are found with a number of other items, so that we can
   set up the following correspondences:
   [23]          PPIS                    NPIS                      absolute negators
            i a. some                    any                       no
              b. someone/somebody        anyone/anybody            no one /nobody
              c. something               anything                  nothing
              d. somewhere/someplace     anywhere/anyplace         nowhere /no place
              e. sometimes               ever                      never
              f. sometime, once          anytime, ever             never
              g. somewhat                at all
           ii a. still                   any more /any longer      no more /no longer
              b. already                 yet
          iii a. so                                                neither/nor
              b. too /as well            either
              c.                         either                    neither
              d.                         either . . . or           neither . . . nor
      These three displays need to be interpreted with some caution. In the first place,
   the relation between paired PPIs and NPIs is not identical in all cases. For example,
   the connection between somewhat and at all is considerably weaker and less systematic
   than that between some and any. Secondly it should be borne in mind that a number
   of the forms have a range of senses or uses, with the correspondences applying only
   to some of them. Take some, for example. Of the several senses distinguished in Ch. 5,
   §7.5, the connection with any and no is clearest in the basic existential quantificational
   sense illustrated in [22i]. But for certain uses, most clearly that seen in That was SOME
   journey (“a remarkable journey”) or SOME friend he was!, there are no close negative
   counterparts.
      A good number of polarity-sensitive items involve quantification. Broadly speaking,
   we find that the following generalisations hold:
   [24] i Universal quantifiers are not polarity-sensitive.
        ii Some multal quantifiers exhibit some degree of negative orientation.
       iii Paucal quantifiers tend to have positive orientation (like a few) or to be approx-
           imate negators (few).
       iv The most central existential quantifiers enter into the pattern of correspondences
           illustrated in [23i].
832          Chapter 9 Negation
            Note in this connection that those uses of some that go beyond simple existential quantifi-
            cation to indicate a fairly considerable quantity do not enter into such correspondences.
            It took some time to rectify the problem, for example, does not have a straightforward
            negative with any or no: #It didn’t take any time to rectify the problem; a pragmatically
            closer negation here would be It didn’t take much time to rectify the problem.
                A further general point to be made is that certain of the NPIs have free choice senses
            in addition to their NPI senses. This applies to any and its compounds and to either
            when it functions as determiner or fused determiner-head in NP structure: Take any
            of the computers; Ask anyone; You can have either of the printers. Ever has a free choice
            sense when compounded with relative and interrogative words (Take whatever you like or
            He’ll grumble whatever you do). Elsewhere ever can express universal quantification: She
            had been ill ever since she returned from Paris (“all the time”); Ever the optimist, she was
            undeterred by these warnings. Free choice and universal quantification are often related
            by implicature: Anyone can do that implicates “Everyone can do that” (see Ch. 5, §7.5).
                We will now provide some further brief comments on the sets given in [23]:      (a) The some ∼ any series ([23i])
          In positive interrogatives the some and any words generally contrast:
         [25] i a. Did Kim make some mistakes?                     b. Did you tell someone?                      [PPI]
              ii a. Did Kim make any mistakes?                     b. Did you tell anyone?                       [NPI]
            The positive orientation of some is reflected in the fact that while the versions in [ii]
            are quite neutral, those in [i] suggest a somewhat greater inclination on the part of the
            speaker to think that the answer may well be positive.
                The variants in [23id] containing place rather than where belong to AmE (informal
            style).
                Ever and never can function as adjuncts of frequency or temporal location. In the
            frequency sense they correspond straightforwardly to sometimes: He sometimes loses
            his patience ∼ He doesn’t ever lose his patience ∼ He never loses his patience.19 For the
            temporal location sense with past time the closest PPI is once: She once liked them ∼
            She didn’t ever like them ∼ She never liked them. For future time the PPI sometime
            can be used: I hope they will change these rules sometime ∼ . . . won’t ever / will never
            change these rules. AmE anytime most often has a free choice sense (Feel free to call me
            anytime), but it is found as an NPI in combination with soon and suchlike expressions
            as counterpart to sometime: I expect it to end sometime soon ∼ %I don’t expect it to end
            anytime soon.
                Correspondence between somewhat and at all is seen in pairs like I somewhat
            regret agreeing to take part ∼ I don’t at all regret agreeing to take part. Somewhat is
            slightly formal in style, and at all occurs in a much wider range of syntactic construc-
            tions. For example, there is no positive counterpart with somewhat for He hasn’t worked
            at all this week. At all commonly occurs as a reinforcing postmodifier in the structure
            of NPs containing any or no, as in I hadn’t had any food at all or I’d had no food at all:       19
            Never is likely to be preferred over verbal negation when ever immediately follows not or the negative verb;
            a more natural use of frequency ever is seen in I don’t think he ever loses his patience. Ever can be used in
            juxtaposition to never with emphatic effect; this device is associated primarily with informal conversation,
            but can be found in other styles too: Any risk of a prime minister abusing this power is effectively
            eliminated because he can never, ever put a political crony into the job.
                                           § 4.3 Correspondences between PPIs, NPIs, and negators                  833
      here the positive is simply I’d had some food. As a modifier of comparatives, somewhat
      can also be paired with any: It was somewhat better than last time ∼ It wasn’t at all / any
      better than last time.
          The PPI somehow generally indicates manner (They had somehow lost their way), but
      can also have a reason sense (in I somehow couldn’t understand what he was getting at
      the word somehow means something like “for some unknown reason” or “in some way
      that I cannot quite specify”). Anyhow exists, but not as the NPI counterpart, so this pair
      is not included in [23i]. As a manner adverb, anyhow is based on free choice any but
      with specialisation of meaning (They had stacked everything into the cupboard anyhow,
      “without care, haphazardly”). More often it has a concessive or connective meaning, like
      anyway.(b) The aspectuals ([23ii])
    The correspondence between the aspectual PPIs and NPIs is illustrated in:
   [26] i a. Ed still lives with us.                         b. Ed doesn’t live with us any more/longer.
        ii a. Jill has already finished.                     b. Jill hasn’t finished yet.
      In the aspectual sense any more is generally written anymore in AmE, and that spelling
      is spreading to BrE.20 In positive interrogatives, some speakers allow still but not any
      more /longer in such examples as Does he still live with you? ∼ %Does he live with you
      any more? A further difference is that any more /longer can be used for projection into
      the future in a way that has no counterpart with still. I’m not working here any more
      is ambiguous between a present time sense (“I no longer work here”) and a futurate
      reading (“I don’t intend to continue working here”), but I’m still working here has only
      the present time interpretation.(c) The either ∼ neither series ([23iii])
    One use of either and neither is as connective adjuncts in the constructions we have used
    as a test of negative polarity for clauses:
   [27] i a. Kim enjoyed it and so did Pat.                  b. Kim didn’t enjoy it and neither did Pat.
        ii a. Kim enjoyed it and Pat did too.                b. Kim didn’t enjoy it and Pat didn’t either.
      Here neither is always in front position in a declarative clause, which excludes the possi-
      bility of a direct counterpart with verbal negation + the NPI either; the matching PPI is
      so. Either occurs in post-verbal position, matching too or as well. In this connective use,
      nor is a variant of neither, but has a slightly wider distribution (cf. Ch. 15, §2.4).
          The either and neither of [23iiic] are the ones that function as existential quantifiers
      in NP structure: He hadn’t read either of them ∼ He had read neither of them. There is
      here no simple PPI counterpart; we can relate these to positive He had read one of them,
      but this differs from either/neither in that it doesn’t indicate selection from a set of two,
      and one, moreover, is not polarity-sensitive. A closer match is with He had read one or
      other of them, where the complex expression one or other is a PPI. The items in [23iiid]
      are markers of coordination: this is the one place where we have absolute negators with
      non-negative counterparts that are not polarity-sensitive.","[850, 851, 852, 853]"
"      1.3.1 The concept ‘having scope over’
          The scope of a negative is most easily seen by considering the semantic effect of removing
          the negative element. We will illustrate by first exhibiting in [13] a case where the negative
          element ·n’t has scope over everything in a sentence, and then in [15] adding to it some
          material over which the negative element does not have scope, pointing out the semantic
          difference that results.
             In the following pair, [a] is negative, and [b] is its positive counterpart:
          [13]    a. Liz didn’t delete the backup file.      b. Liz deleted the backup file.
          Each of the clause constituents Liz, deleted, and the backup file in [b] makes a con-
          tribution to the meaning; we can therefore give the truth conditions of [b] as a list of
                                                     § 1.3.1 The concept ‘having scope over’     791
 statements:
 [14] i “A deletion operation took place”
      ii “The deletion operation was performed by Liz”
     iii “The deletion operation was performed on the backup file”
 Each of these has to be true in order for [13b] to be true. And the falsity of any one of
 them is sufficient to make [13a] true. That is, the negated sentence [13a] is true if either
 there was no act of deletion, or if any deletion operation that occurred was performed
 by someone other than Liz, or if any deletion operation that occurred was performed on
 something other than the backup file. The status of the propositions in [14] thus changes
 as we switch from [a] to [b]: the falsity of any one of them establishes the truth of [a],
 but also the falsity of [b]. All three components are therefore said to be inside the scope
 of the negation – or, to put it another way, the negative has scope over all three of them.
     The negative can therefore be said to have scope over the whole clause, i.e. over
 everything in the clause (except itself): we can say that the scope of the negation here is
 “Liz deleted the backup file”.
     Now compare the following examples, in which an extra clause has been added to
 each of the sentences:
 [15] a. Liz didn’t delete the backup file and        b. Liz deleted the backup file and
           Sue wrote the report.                         Sue wrote the report.
  The truth conditions for [15b] consist of those given in [14] together with
 [16]    “Sue wrote the report”
  But this is also a truth condition for [15a]: if Sue didn’t write her report then both
  examples in [15] are false. The status of [16] is thus not affected by the negation: it is
  outside the scope of the negative. So the scope of the negative is the same in [15a] as in
  [13a], namely “Liz deleted the backup file”.
     Notice that [15a] has the form of a coordination of clauses, and it is quite generally
  the case that a negative in one clause does not have scope over another clause that is
  coordinate with it. There is, though, an exception to this: a negative can have scope over
  a clause-coordination that involves gapping (Ch. 15, §4.2). Compare the following:
 [17]    a. Kim wasn’t at work on Monday               b. Kim was at work on Monday
            or Pat on Tuesday.                            or Pat on Tuesday.
  These involve the following components of meaning:
 [18] i “Kim was at work on Monday”
      ii “Pat was at work on Tuesday”
  Because of the meaning of or the truth of either one of these is sufficient to establish the
  truth of [17b]. But for [17a] to be true, both of [18i–ii] must be false. The negation thus
  affects the status of both: both fall within its scope. In this construction, therefore, the
  negative has scope over the whole coordination.","[810, 811]"
"       Clause continuations with not even
        Negative clauses allow a continuation with not even + complement or adjunct, as in
        [1ia]. This is comparable to Ed didn’t even read the abstract, but instead of the abstract
        being integrated into the structure of the clause, it is added on, as a prosodically detached
        supplement. When the clause is negative, the following even is commonly preceded by
        not, as here, but not is inadmissible after a positive clause. (For the meaning of even, see
        Ch. 6, §7.3.)       Connective adjuncts
        In [1ii] the underlined clause is followed by an anaphorically reduced clause introduced
        by a connective adjunct. Following a negative clause we find neither or nor, whereas a
                                                         § 1.2 An overview of negation types       787
  positive clause is followed by so. Note that switching the connective adjuncts leads to
  ungrammaticality: compare ∗Ed didn’t read it; so did I and ∗Ed read it; neither/nor did I.
  A contrast of the same kind applies when the connective adjunct is located at the end of
  the following clause:
  [2]     a. Ed didn’t read it, and I didn’t either.    b. Ed read it, and I did too.
  Again we may contrast Ed didn’t read it and I didn’t too and ∗Ed read it and I did either.
                           ∗  (The connective adjuncts neither, nor, either and so, too are not restricted to occurrence
  in reduced clauses, but the reduced construction provides the simplest test for our
  purposes.) Reversed polarity tags
  Did he? and didn’t he? in [1iii] are reduced interrogative clauses, known as tags. They
  represent the most common type of interrogative tag, being used to seek confirmation
  of what has been said in the clause to which they are attached. This type of tag reverses
  the polarity of the preceding clause, so we have negative clause + positive tag in [iiia],
  positive clause + negative tag in [iiib].
     These are not the only type of clause + tag construction: it is possible to have posi-
  tive clause + positive tag, as in Ed read it, did he? and some speakers allow negative
  clause + negative tag, as in %Ed didn’t read it, didn’t he? But these are clearly different
  intonationally and in their pragmatic effect from those in [1iii], as described in Ch. 10,
  §5: our diagnostic is based on the most neutral type of confirmation tag.","[806, 807]"
"      1.3.2 Relative scope: wide scope negation and narrow scope negation
             Scope is the semantic analogue of syntactic constituent structure, and in many cases
             the syntactic structure reflects the scope of negation in an obvious and elementary way.
             Compare:
          [21] i a. She didn’t say that she knew him.                 b. She said that she didn’t know him.
               ii a. She didn’t promise to help him.                  b. She promised not to help him.
             In [i] the scope of the negative in [a] is “she said that she knew him”, while in [b] it is
             “she knew him”. Thus the negative has scope over say in [ia] but not in [ib], and this
             correlates with the fact that in [ia] say is located within the subordinate clause functioning
             as complement of the negated verb do, whereas in [ib] the negative is located within the
             clause functioning as complement to say. Similarly, the negative has scope over promise
             in [iia], but not in [iib], and again the negative is in the matrix clause in [iia] but the
             subordinate clause in [iib].
                The concept of scope applies to numerous other kinds of element besides negation
             markers, including verbs. Compare, for example:
          [22]        a. She tried to stop offending them.             b. She stopped trying to offend them.
             In [a] stop is syntactically within the complement of try and semantically within its
             scope, and conversely in [b]: here try is within the syntactic complement and semantic
             scope of stop. In [21iib], then, it is not simply that promise is outside the scope of the nega-
             tive: the negative is inside the scope of promise. We are concerned here, then, with relative
             scope: we have two scope-bearing elements and the issue is which has scope over the other.
                As far as negation is concerned, the clearest cases are those like [21] where relative
             scope is reflected in the contrast between matrix and subordinate clauses.1 Less obvious
         1
             Even here, however, matters are not entirely straightforward. With auxiliary verbs the issue arises as to
             whether a following not belongs in the matrix or the subordinate clause (see §2.3.2), and we will also find
                                                                                    § 1.3.2 Relative scope        793
   are cases where relative scope is not marked by clause subordination in this way. We will
   consider two such cases here, involving the scope of negation relative to adjuncts in clause
   structure and relative to quantifiers; the issue also arises with respect to coordinators
   (see Ch. 15, §2.2.2) and modal auxiliaries (Ch. 3, §9.3.1).(a) Relative scope of negation and adjuncts in clause structure
    Consider first the relative scope of negation and an adjunct such as intentionally.
   [23] i Liz intentionally deleted the backup file.
        ii Liz intentionally didn’t delete the backup file.           [adjunct has scope over negative]
       iii Liz didn’t intentionally delete the backup file.           [negative has scope over adjunct]
   The truth conditions for positive [23i] can be given as follows:
   [24] i “Liz deleted the backup file”
        ii “Liz did what she did intentionally”
   Now [23ii] cannot be true by virtue of [24ii] being false: it can only be true if [24i]
   is false. Thus [24ii] is a condition for the truth of both [23i] and [ii] and hence out-
   side the scope of negation in [23ii]. And since [24ii] is the meaning contributed by
   intentionally, we can say that intentionally in [23ii] is outside the scope of negation. In
   [23i] what was intentional was Liz’s deleting the backup file, whereas in [23ii] what
   was intentional was Liz’s not deleting the backup file, so the negative is inside the
   scope of intentionally: it contributes to specifying what it was that was done inten-
   tionally.
       The interpretation of [23iii] is quite different. This can be true by virtue of it being
   false that Liz acted intentionally. So this time intentionally is inside the scope of negation,
   rather than the other way round. An equivalent way of expressing the difference is to say
   that in [23ii] the negative has narrow scope relative to the adjunct, whereas in [23iii] it
   has wide scope.
       We noted that in the most elementary cases relative scope is reflected in a con-
   trast between matrix and subordinate clauses, as in [21], and in cases like [23ii–iii] the
   difference in meaning can be brought out by means of glosses involving clause subordi-
   nation:
   [25] i “Liz acted intentionally in not deleting the backup file”            [meaning of [23ii]]
         ii “Liz didn’t act intentionally in deleting the backup file”        [meaning of [23iii]]
   When the negative has narrow scope, it appears in the subordinate clause of the gloss;
   when it has wide scope, it appears in the matrix clause of the gloss.
   Contraries and contradictories
   The contrast between [23ii] and [23iii] can also be brought out by noting that they stand
   in different semantic relations to the positive [23i]:
   [26] i Liz intentionally didn’t delete the backup file and Liz intentionally deleted the backup
           file are contraries: they cannot be both true, but they can be both false.
        ii Liz didn’t intentionally delete the backup file and Liz intentionally deleted the backup
           file are contradictories: they cannot be both true, but they cannot be both false
           either.   that in certain circumstances non-verbal negation within a subordinate clause can have scope over the matrix
   (see §3.2.1).
794    Chapter 9 Negation
      Both [23i] and [23ii] are false if Liz deleted the backup file unintentionally, but there is
      no context in which both [23i] and [23iii] are false.
      Relative scope and the contrast between clausal and subclausal negation
      The difference in scope of the negatives in [23ii–iii] is reflected in the fact that while the
      latter behaves straightforwardly as a negative clause, the former does not:
      [27]         narrow scope: subclausal                  wide scope: clausal
              i a. ∗Liz intentionally didn’t delete the   b. Liz didn’t intentionally delete the
                    backup file, and neither did Sue.        backup file, and neither did Sue.
             ii a. ∗Liz intentionally didn’t delete       b. Liz didn’t intentionally delete the
                    the backup file, did she?                backup file, did she?
      The neither continuation is permitted in [b] but not [a] (and so . . . would be somewhat
      awkward in [a], but the inadmissibility of neither is sufficient to establish a clear differ-
      ence). Similarly did she? as a reversed polarity tag seeking confirmation of what is said in
      the preceding clause can be added in [b] but not in [a]. Thus [23iii] is a negative clause,
      but [23ii] is not.
         It should not be assumed, however, that in negative clauses the negative necessarily
      has scope over every element in the clause. One case where this is not so is [19a]. Here
      the negative does not have scope over however, but that does not prevent the clause being
      negative: compare Liz, however, didn’t delete the backup file and neither did Sue (where the
      neither continuation shows that the clause is negative), or Liz, however, didn’t delete the
      backup file, did she? (where the tag shows the clause is negative). We will see, moreover,
      that the exceptions are not confined to cases like this where the element outside the scope
      of negation is non-truth-conditional.
      Relative scope and linear order
      An obvious syntactic difference between [23ii] and [23iii] is that intentionally precedes
      didn’t in the former while didn’t precedes intentionally in the latter. The semantic differ-
      ence in scope is marked syntactically by a difference in linear order. In both examples,
      then, the element with wider scope precedes the one with narrower scope. This represents
      the default case:
      [28] Given a construction containing two scope-bearing elements, the one which
              comes first will generally have scope over the one which comes later.
         As implied by the ‘generally’, relative scope does not always correlate directly with
      relative order in this way. One factor that may override it is intonation. Compare:
      [29] i Liz didn’t delete the backup file intentionally. [negative has scope over adjunct]
           ii Liz didn’t delete the backup file – intentionally. [adjunct has scope over negative]
      In the intended pronunciations of these, intentionally falls in the same intonational
      phrase as didn’t in [i], whereas in [ii] it is prosodically detached. In [i], the default
      pattern is observed: the negative has scope over the following adjunct. But in [ii]
      the prosodic offsetting of the adjunct allows it to take scope over the whole of what
      precedes.
         A similar illustration is provided by reason adjuncts:
      [30] i Because it cost $50 she didn’t buy it.             [adjunct has scope over negative]
           ii She didn’t buy it because it cost $50.                                [ambiguous]
                                                                         § 1.3.2 Relative scope    795
   In [i] we find the default pattern: the adjunct comes first and has scope over the neg-
   ative. The narrow scope of the negative here can again be brought out by a roughly
   equivalent sentence in which it appears in a subordinate clause (underlined): The $50
   price caused her not to buy it. Here we understand that $50 was too high a price. Example
   [ii], however, is ambiguous. It can have an interpretation following the default pattern,
   with the negative having scope over the adjunct; here the adjunct will be in the same
   intonational phrase as didn’t. In this interpretation we understand that $50 was a good
   price, but that this price did not lead her to buy it – and there is an implicature that
   she did buy it, for some other reason. But [ii] can also have the same interpretation as
   [i]. This departs from the default pattern given in [28], and the adjunct would form a
   separate intonational phrase (and in writing it might well be preceded by a comma to
   remove the ambiguity).(b) Relative scope of negation and quantifiers
    The issue of relative scope also arises when negation combines with quantification:
   [31] i He hasn’t got many friends.                     [negative has scope over quantifier]
        ii Many people didn’t attend the meetings.        [quantifier has scope over negative]
   Here [i] is the contradictory of He has many friends: one will be true, the other false. But
   [ii] is not even the contrary of Many people attended the meetings: both could easily be
   true. Given a large enough set of people, it is perfectly possible for the subset attending
   and the subset not attending to both qualify as ‘many’. Again the narrow scope of the
   negative in [ii] is brought out by a gloss with a negative in a subordinate clause: “There
   were many people who didn’t attend the meetings”. Note, however, that [ii] behaves as a
   negative clause: cf. Many people didn’t attend the meetings, not even the first one or Many
   people didn’t attend the meetings, did they? This confirms the point made above that in
   negative clauses the negative does not necessarily have scope over all other elements in
   the clause.
   Linear order
   The examples in [31] follow the default pattern where relative scope matches relative
   linear order. Again, however, the default may be overridden under certain circumstances:
   [32] i I didn’t agree with many of the points he made.                 [scope ambiguous]
        ii Everybody didn’t support the proposal, but most did.         [wide scope negation]
   Example [i] can be interpreted with either the negative or the quantifier having scope
   over the other. With wide scope negation it is like [31i], the contradictory of I agreed with
   many of the points he made. In this reading there weren’t many points that I agreed with.
   The wide scope quantification reading can be expressed unambiguously by fronting the
   quantified NP: Many of the points he made I didn’t agree with. In this second reading
   there were many points that I disagreed with; it is a less likely reading of [32i] than
   the one with wide scope negation, but certainly possible, especially with a clear change
   of intonation contour on many. Without the but clause, [32ii] would be ambiguous in
   the same way: most did, however, forces the interpretation where the negative has scope
   over the quantifier, as it unambiguously does in Not everybody supported the proposal.
   Again the intonation can assist in making the meaning clear: the reading with wide scope
   negation reading will typically be encouraged by high pitch on EVerybody.
796           Chapter 9 Negation
                Because the preferred (most likely) interpretation matches scope with order of ap-
             pearance in the sentence, if we change the order – for example, by switching from active
             to passive – we will change the preferred interpretation:
          [33] i Many members didn’t back the proposal.                                    [narrow scope negative]
               ii The proposal wasn’t backed by many members.                       [wide scope negative preferred]
             A prosodic override is virtually impossible in [i]: many has scope over the negative. In
             [ii] the preferred reading has many within the scope of the negative (“there weren’t many
             who supported the proposal”), though it is just possible for this to be overridden, making
             it equivalent to [i].
          Equivalence between wide scope universal and narrow scope existential quantification
          [34] i All of them didn’t have a clue what he meant.                  [wide scope universal]
               ii None of them had a clue what he meant.                     [narrow scope existential]
          These are semantically equivalent (cf. Ch. 5, §5.1). In [i] the universal quantifier all has
          scope over the negative: all of them had a negative property. In [ii] none expresses the
          negation of existential quantification: “it is not the case that any of them had a clue what
          he meant”. (A more emphatic version is Not one of them had a clue what he meant, with
          negative and quantifier expressed separately, and the one with wider scope coming first.)
          Although [34i–ii] are equivalent, version [ii] is quite strongly preferred. This preference
          for a formulation with existential quantification within the scope of the negative over
          universal quantification with scope over the negative is reflected in the possibilities for
          overriding order in clauses combining negation with universal quantification:
          [35] i All of the members didn’t support the proposal.
               ii The proposal wasn’t supported by all of the members.
             Here [i] can be interpreted with wide scope negation (“Not all of the members supported
             the proposal”): it allows a prosodic override of the narrow scope negation reading much
             more readily than [33i] because None of the members supported the proposal would be
             preferred over the narrow scope negation reading of [35i]. Conversely, override is hardly
             possible in [ii]. The normal reading here has wide scope negation (“not all”): instead of
             overriding the order to put all outside the scope of negation one would normally use any
             instead of all (The proposal wasn’t supported by any of the members), with the negative
             having scope over an existential quantifier.","[812, 813, 814, 815, 816]"
"       The restriction to negative contexts in declarative main clauses
        With some items things are fairly clear. Leaving aside certain special constructions dealt
        with in §4.4 below, the NPI at all is completely excluded from positive declaratives. She
        didn’t like it at all is admissible, but ∗She liked it at all is not, and so on. The same applies
        to the any series of words once we set aside the semantically distinct free choice uses.
        But for others we find that a word may be an NPI in some styles or registers and not in
        others. The item much is a particularly problematic case of this sort, and long and many
        have similar properties.
        Contexts for much, long, and many
        Much has a bewilderingly large set of distinct uses associated with different styles or
        registers. Compare:
       [11] i a. The new, more elaborated abstracts were much favoured among modernists.
               b. Location theorists have given these matters much consideration.
               c. This means much to the American tradition.
               d. The design of an interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle.
               e. The president spent much of the weekend at his summer home on Cape Cod.
            ii a. Thank you very much for the lovely flowers.
               b. So much has happened that I’m not sure I can remember it all.
               c. When I wear these I look too much like my dad.
               d. This is much better than the other one.
               e. I’ll tell you this much: I didn’t pay full price.
           iii a. The lecture was very long but it didn’t really cover much.
               b. I went sailing once but I didn’t enjoy it much.
               c. He isn’t much of a dancer.
        In general terms the examples in [i] can be said to be more characteristic of written
        English, literary contexts, formal style, and the usage of older speakers. The uses illus-
        trated in [ii–iii] are more likely to be found in spoken English, conversational contexts,
        informal style, or the usage of younger speakers. But this is only a rough guide. It is
        extraordinarily difficult to separate the constructions out in a rigorous way, because cer-
        tain phrases from the literary language have become familiar sayings in everyday speech
        almost as quotations.
           We can be more specific about the examples in [11i], which will give a sense of what
        we mean. In [ia], much is a premodifier of a past participle (in its passive use), and has
        an intensificatory meaning like “greatly” or “to a high degree”. This is quite literary, but
        even this turns up in casual conversation through a number of fixed or partially fixed
        phrases that are in a sense borrowings from an earlier stage of the language; for example,
        the phrase Much appreciated is often used with the sense “Thank you”. In [ib], much
        is determiner in NP structure, and means “a lot of ”; again, this is literary, but while
        We have much sugar is extremely unlikely to occur in casual conversation, one might
        easily hear something like The living room is a scene of much confusion, I’m afraid in a
        semi-jocular echo of the formal construction. Something similar is true for [ic], where
        much is used as fused determiner-head. The phrase much like in [id] is distinctly literary
                                § 4.1.2 Variation in the strength of the negative orientation     827
  in that context, yet the phrase one is much like the next has been adopted as a common
  turn of phrase in conversation. And much of the weekend in [ie] is slightly literary (a
  lot of the weekend would be more conversational), but much of the time is familiar in
  conversation.
      There is an important difference between the cases in [11i] and those in [ii]. No cau-
  tions about literariness or formality need apply to the latter: all of them are fully natural
  in casual conversation in the contemporary language. It should be noted that much with
  an adverbial modifier like very, so, or too as in [iia–c] has a far wider distribution than
  much on its own. Much as a modifier of comparatives, as in [d], is very common (much
  longer is analogous to very long); and so are the phrases this much and that much, as in
  [e]. None of these illustrate NPIs.
      That leaves the kind of use seen in [11iii]. These are the constructions in which much
  is an NPI. This is particularly clear in contrasts like these:
 [12] i a. I don’t enjoy sailing much.            b. ∗I enjoy sailing much.
      ii a. We don’t have much time.              b. ∗We have much time.
     iii a. Kim isn’t much of a dancer.           b. ∗Kim is much of a dancer.
      Much is thus certainly an NPI (and it is therefore on the list in [5]), despite the fact
  that looking at a random selection of occurrences of much would make it easy to think
  that one had found counterevidence to that statement. Many occurrences of much are,
  indeed, in affirmative environments. But nonetheless, if we focus on (say) the use of
  much as a post-verbal adjunct when occurring without its own premodifying adverb, it
  is clearly an NPI, as the sharp contrast between [12ia] and [b] shows. Instead of [12ib]
  we would have, in informal style, I enjoy sailing a lot / a great deal. The informal way to
  express the positive counterpart of the claim in [12iia] would be not [12iib] but something
  like We have plenty of time. And to express the positive counterpart of [12iiia] one would
  use something like Kim is quite a dancer.
      The durational adverb long – which, like much, expresses multal quantification –
  exhibits similar behaviour. We have She hasn’t known him long but not ∗She has known
  him long (cf. She has known him a long time); but long can occur pre-verbally in (somewhat
  formal) positive clauses: I have long thought that this should be changed.
      Multal many also shows some signs of negative orientation, though to a lesser
  extent. The sentences Many were lost and We saw many flowers, with no negation, are
  very slightly literary, whereas Not many were lost and We didn’t see many flowers, with
  negation, are as common in casual conversation as in writing. But again, an example
  like ?I’m not hungry because I’ve eaten many biscuits sounds completely unnatural,
  with a lot of biscuits very strongly preferred in informal style.","[846, 847]"
"      1.3.3 Focus
             In all but the most trivial negative clauses there are several different conditions whose
             failure to hold would cause the clause to be strictly true. Which condition is intended
             can be indicated by a speaker through the device of stressing the most closely associated
             word. A constituent marked by stress as being crucial to the way in which an instance of
             negation should be understood is called the focus of that negation.2         Negation focus, falsity conditions, and prosody
             Let us again compare a negative clause and its positive counterpart:
          [36]        a. Your children don’t hate school.             b. Your children hate school.
         2
             Throughout this chapter ‘focus’ is to be understood in the sense of ‘informational focus’: see Ch. 6, §7.3, for
             the distinction between two concepts of focus.
                                                                                  § 1.3.3 Focus    797
 One way of giving the truth conditions for the positive [b], one which highlights the
 contribution of the separate words, is as follows:
 [37] i a. “Somebody’s children hate school”                 b. “You are that person”
      ii a. “Some relatives of yours hate school”            b. “They are your children”
     iii a. “There is some attitude your children            b. “That attitude is hatred”
            harbour towards school”
     iv a. “There is something your children hate”           b. “That thing is school”
 In order for [36b] to be true, each of these conditions must be true; but for [36a] to be true
 it is sufficient that any one of the conditions be false. From this point of view, negative
 statements run the risk of being relatively uninformative. It could be that somebody’s
 children hate school, but not yours – or indeed that no one’s children hate school; it
 could be that some relatives of yours hate school, but not your children – or indeed that
 none of your relatives hate school. And so on.
     English provides ways of making negatives more informative by giving some indica-
 tion as to which condition fails to hold. The way we are concerned with here involves the
 use of stress and intonation to highlight the part of the clause that is associated with that
 condition. Consider, for example, the four ways of saying [36a] shown in [38], where
 the small capitals indicate heavy stress and raised or changing pitch:
 [38] i YOUR children don’t hate school.
         “If there are children who hate school, they are not yours”
      ii Your CHILDREN don’t hate school.
         “If any of your relatives hate school, it is not your children”
     iii Your children don’t HATE school.
         “If your children harbour an attitude towards school, it is not hatred”
     iv Your children don’t hate SCHOOL.
         “If your children do hate something, it’s not school”
 The part of the clause that is prosodically highlighted is the focus. In [38i] the focus is
 your, and this indicates that what makes the positive Your children hate school false is the
 non-satisfaction of the condition associated with your. Hence the gloss we have provided
 for this reading, “If there are children who hate school, they are not yours”, which locates
 the failure to satisfy the set of conditions given in [37] specifically in [ib]. Similarly, the
 glosses given for [38ii–iv] reflect the choice of children, hate, and school respectively as
 focus.","[816, 817]"
"
      5.1 The formation of interrogative tags
       Reversed polarity and constant polarity tags
        A tag is a short interrogative clause which may be negative or positive:
        [2]    i Your friends made a good job of it, didn’t they?                            [negative tag]
              ii They haven’t finished it, have they?                                         [positive tag]
        In [i] a negative tag attaches to a positive anchor and in [ii] a positive tag attaches to a
        negative anchor: we refer to these as reversed polarity tags. It is also possible to have
        constant polarity tags, where the tag has the same polarity as the anchor. Thus in [i] we
        could have did they? instead of didn’t they?, and in [ii] haven’t they? instead of have they?
        The four possibilities are shown in:
        [3]         positive anchor                 negative anchor
               i a. He is ill, isn’t he?        b. He isn’t ill, is he?            [reversed polarity tag]
              ii a. He is ill, is he?           b. %He isn’t ill, isn’t he?        [constant polarity tag]
        As far as the meaning is concerned, the important issue is not whether the tag is positive
        or negative, but whether it has reversed or constant polarity. Reversed polarity tags are
        much the more frequent, and constant polarity tags occur predominantly with posi-
        tive anchors: many speakers reject examples like [iib]. A more formal variant of the
        inflectional negative isn’t he? is the analytic negative is he not?",[912]
"
2.1 Primary verbal negation
  Positive clauses containing a primary form of an auxiliary verb may be negated by
  adding not after the verb, giving analytic primary negation, or by inflecting the verb in
  the negative, giving synthetic primary negation:
  [1]     i Kim will be here later on.                   [positive clause with auxiliary verb]
         ii Kim will not be here later on.                       [analytic primary negation]
        iii Kim won’t be here later on.                         [synthetic primary negation]
  In [i] we have the neutral present tense form will in a positive clause. In [ii] this neutral
  form will is modified by not in post-auxiliary position. In [iii] the negation is marked
  by the negative present tense form won’t.
     To negate a clause containing a primary form of a lexical verb it is necessary to add
  the semantically empty auxiliary that we have called supportive do:
  [2]     i Kim waved to us.                                 [positive clause with lexical verb]
         ii Kim did not wave to us.                               [analytic primary negation]
        iii Kim didn’t wave to us.                               [synthetic primary negation]
800         Chapter 9 Negation
           Do takes on the inflectional properties (here preterite tense) that in the positive are
           carried by the lexical verb, and the latter now appears in the plain form. Again the
           negation may be marked analytically or synthetically by a negative form of do.3       The choice between analytic and synthetic primary negation
           Analytic and synthetic primary negation forms are not fully interchangeable. The main
           difference is one of style level.
              The synthetic forms are a mark of informal style. While they are the default form
           in ordinary conversation and informal writing,4 they are not used in very formal and
           solemn contexts or in some kinds of written (especially published) language. They are by
           no means absent from academic prose, but the author or speaker who uses them makes
           a definite style decision: the effect of using synthetic negative auxiliaries is to increase
           the sense of familiarity, intimacy, and accessibility. Compare the following pairs, where
           the [a] members belong to formal style, the [b] members to informal style:
           [3]    i a. I do not accept, and will not condone or defend, this shameful policy.
                    b. I don’t accept, and won’t condone or defend, this shameful policy.
                 ii a. This is not to say that one could not conceive of a world in which aesthetic
                       properties did not supervene on the physical; but the necessity of positing them
                       does not seem to me an attractive prospect.
                    b. This doesn’t mean that you couldn’t imagine a world where aesthetic properties
                       didn’t supervene on physical ones; but having to assume them doesn’t seem like
                       an attractive prospect to me.
           While [ia] sounds grave and parliamentary, [ib] does not, and might be judged to
           sound too petulant in the context of a political speech. Likewise, [iia] has the tone of a
           published paper in analytic philosophy, while [iib] (in which various other changes are
           made in addition to the choice of synthetic negatives) has the flavour of a more informal
           explanation of the same ideas; it might be judged too patronising for appearance in
           some philosophy journals, but just right for a lecture. Naturally, there is much variation
           in style, and some academic writers choose to use a much more informal style than
           others.
               The fact that synthetic negative auxiliaries are informal does not mean that analytic
           forms are neutral or preferable. Analytic forms sound unnatural in many conversational
           contexts unless there is some clear reason for their use, e.g., emphasis on the word not
           (I did NOT sneak out by the back door when she arrived!). Thus in an ordinary conversation,
           I don’t think so or Don’t worry, I won’t be long are perfectly natural even in slow and careful
           speech, while I do not think so or Do not worry, I will not be long would be not just unusual
           but highly unnatural.5       3
         In earlier forms of English, non-auxiliary verbs in primary forms were also postmodified by not. Instances
         are preserved in various biblical and proverbial phrases (I care not whether she lives or dies ; He who knows
         not, and knows that he knows not, can be taught), but the construction is no longer part of the productive
         syntax of the language.
       4
         This applies to the synthetic forms that are fully acceptable; for the case of %mayn’t and of aren’t with a 1st
         person singular subject, see Ch. 18, §5.5.
       5
         Such unnatural avoidance of negative auxiliaries is used in films to underscore the alienness of such characters
         as visitors from outer space.
                                                                             § 2.1 Primary verbal negation           801
     Grammatical restriction on synthetic negatives: inadmissible in inverted conditionals
     Although the difference is mainly stylistic, there is one construction that does not permit
     synthetic negatives, namely the inverted conditional (see Ch. 3, §2.1.2). Compare:
 [4]       i Had it not been for the weather, the plan would have succeeded.
          ii ∗Hadn’t it been for the weather, the plan would have succeeded.
 Synthetic verbal negation is a matter of inflection
     The suffix ·n’t is often mistaken for a reduced pronunciation of the word not. That is
     of course its etymology, but it is no longer an unstressed pronunciation of not; in the
     contemporary language it is a verbal suffix. There are syntactic, morphological, and
     phonological reasons for distinguishing between such pairs as does not and doesn’t, as
     described in Ch. 3, §1.9.","[819, 820, 821]"
" Downward entailing quantified NPs
  All quantified NPs that are downward entailing in the sense explained in §3.3 sanction
  following NPIs. Compare:
  [37] i a. Few of the bees stung anyone.              b. ∗A few of the bees stung anyone.
       ii a. At most ten students did any work.        b. ∗At least ten students did any work.
  Most downward entailing quantified NPs are negative and hence are already covered
  under (a) above, but we noted in footnote 15 that at most triggers downward entail-
  ment although it is not negative. As seen in [iia], it nevertheless sanctions following
  NPIs. A few and at least are upward entailing, and do not create non-affirmative con-
  texts.
      Although [37iia] is not itself negative, it has clear links with negation. At most ten
  of the thirty students worked entails that the other twenty (the majority) did not work:
  compare the negative paraphrase No more than ten of the students worked, did they?
      At least ten of the thirty students worked, on the other hand, has no such negative
  entailment: in fact it suggests that some of the other twenty may have worked. At least
  can be paraphrased by no less than, but this yields a positive clause: No less than ten of
  the students worked, didn’t they?",[857]
"       Formation of tags by reduction of full interrogatives
        In the examples so far, the tag might be regarded as a reduced version of a full closed
        interrogative clause corresponding to the anchor. The tag in [2i], for example, might be
        derived from its anchor in three steps, as follows:
        [4]     i your friends made a good job of it                                               [anchor]
               ii your friends didn’t make a good job of it                       [step i: reverse polarity]
              iii didn’t your friends make a good job of it?                  [step ii: form interrogative]
              iv didn’t they?                                                             [step iii: reduce]
        For constant polarity tags, step i would of course be skipped. Although this procedure
        works in the great majority of cases, it runs into difficulties with anchors like those in:
        [5]    i Few of them liked it, did they?
              ii It’s hardly fair, is it?
        The only way we could apply step i to the anchor few of them liked it would be to change
        this into few of them didn’t like it, which would lead via steps ii and iii to the tag didn’t
        they? But in fact the reversed polarity tag for this anchor is did they?, as in [5i]. The reason
        is that few of them liked it is in fact negative (see Ch. 9, §3.3), so the reversed polarity tag
        must be positive. It is a negative, however, with no positive counterpart, so step i can’t
        be applied. The same applies with [ii].
                                                          § 5.1 The formation of interrogative tags         893
 Direct formation of the tag
  It follows that we need rules to account for the tags directly, rather than by reduction of
  some full interrogative clause. The form of the tag is as in [6], and it can be derived by
  procedure [7]:
 [6]       Auxiliary as predicator + personal pronoun as subject (+ not)
 [7]     i Subject: if anchor subject is a personal pronoun, repeat it; otherwise take the
           anchor subject as antecedent and select the appropriate personal pronoun.
        ii Auxiliary lexeme: if anchor predicator is an auxiliary, select the same lexeme,
           otherwise select do.
       iii Auxiliary tense: same as anchor tense.
       iv Auxiliary person–number properties (if any): determined by agreement with
           subject.
        v Polarity: opposite to that of anchor for reversed polarity tags, the same for con-
           stant polarity tags.
       vi Negation: if tag is negative, choose between the less formal synthetic negation
           (with negative form of auxiliary) and the more formal analytic negation (neutral
           auxiliary, with final not)
  Step [i] will often require pragmatic information: the tag for the anchor the boss has
  arrived can be either hasn’t he? or hasn’t she?, depending on the sex of the boss. Step [ii]
  reflects the normal rules for closed interrogative formation: the closed interrogative is a
  do-support construction. Step [iv] selects person–number properties by reference to the
  tag subject rather than the anchor predicator to cater for cases like Everybody has read
  it, haven’t they?, where the anaphoric personal pronoun for singular everybody is plural
  they. Steps [v] and [vi] handle the polarity of the tag and of the auxiliary in accordance
  with the account given above.","[912, 913]"
"      Emphatic polarity in negatives
          Emphatic negatives are seen in:
      [24] i He thinks they are cheating, but they are NOT / AREN’T.
           ii You’re wrong: I did NOT / DIDN’T move it.
          iii He never DID understand how she felt.
          Examples [i–ii] have primary verb negation, and hence require an auxiliary verb for this
          reason as well as because of the emphatic polarity. The stress falls on the negative element:
          the verb itself if it is a negative form or else the not. The negation in [iii] is non-verbal
          (marked by never): the unemphatic version is He never understood how she felt. Supportive
          do is therefore added to [iii] just to carry the stress that marks emphatic polarity.10     10
          Auxiliary do was used more widely in earlier stages of the language, and in certain genres one comes across
          archaic uses that go beyond our do-support constructions – e.g. in legal language (The person before the court
          is charged that at Newborough, on or about the 14th day of June, 1997, he did murder one James Robinson).
                                              § 2.1.4 Code: elliptical stranding and pro-verb do     99
2.1.4 Code: elliptical stranding and the pro-verb do
    In the code construction the VP of a clause is reduced, with the remainder of its semantic
    content being recoverable from the context. In the simplest case we have ellipsis of the
    complement of an auxiliary verb:
    [25]         full version                          reduced version
            i a. Pat [can help him too].            b. I can help him and Pat [can too].
           ii a. Pat [is in debt as well].          b. I’m in debt and Pat [is as well].
    In [ib] we understand “Pat can help him too” but the “help him” is left unexpressed,
    recoverable from the preceding clause. Similarly in [iib] there is ellipsis of in debt. The
    site of the ellipsis is shown by the gap symbol ‘ ’ , and we say that the verbs can and is
    are stranded, i.e. left on their own before the site of ellipsis. While auxiliary verbs can
    be stranded in this way, lexical verbs cannot: want, for example cannot be stranded to
    give ∗I want to go and Pat wants      as well.","[118, 119]"
"  Fused-head NPs
      Cardinal numerals occur commonly in simple and partitive fused-head NPs, and onen
      follows this pattern. Ones is found in the simple type, where it fills the gap resulting from
      the inability of a to function as fused-head, and in the special type with the interpretation
      “a person”:                                                                                             
  [45] i a. Kim has written four novels, and Pat has written two/onen .
                                                                                                            [simple]
         b. Mary bought a book, and I bought ∗a /one s as well.
       ii They gave us four copies but two/onen of them seemed defective.                                [partitive]
      iii He behaved like ones who considers himself born to rule.                                         [special]
  Zero and nought
      Zero and BrE nought are marginal members of the set of cardinal numerals. They act like
      cardinals in arithmetic operations (zero/nought times ten), in percentages (zero percent), in
      decimals (zero/nought point two), and temperature measures (zero/nought degrees Celsius).
      Zero, but not nought, also functions as a determiner comparable to no (which is not a
      cardinal numeral, and does not take part in any of the rules for numeral formation):
  [46]         a. They made zero/no errors.                   b. They have zero/no chance of winning.
      Zero is quite rare in comparison with no; its origin as a mathematical term for the number
      “0” tends to give utterances with zero a pseudo-scientific character. Zero differs from no
      in that it is not a marker of negation. The difference is brought out, for example, by the
      reversed polarity tag test for clause polarity (Ch. 9, §1.1): contrast They made zero errors,
      didn’t they? and They made no errors, did they? 29
7.7 The disjunctive determinatives either and neither
  Either as determiner: non-affirmative and free choice uses
      Either selects a count singular head: either parent, but not ∗either children or ∗either
      information. Like any, it has a non-affirmative use (eithern) and a free choice use (eitherf):
  [47] i a. He didn’t like eithern teacher.                    b. ∗He liked either teacher.
       ii a. Did eithern boy have a key?                       b. ∗Either boy had a key.
      iii a. You can take eitherf computer.                    b. ∗She had taken either computer.
      The inadmissible [b] examples are affirmative and also exclude a free choice interpreta-
      tion.",[407]
"
6.2 Negative concord and pleonastic negation
   We turn now to constructions where a single semantic negative is expressed more than
   once.(a) The standard variety
    There are a number of constructions in Standard English in which the negation of a
    clause is expressed at more than one point morphologically:
   [4]     i Their action was neither illegal nor immoral. [disjunctive coordination concord]
          ii They aren’t here, I don’t think.                          [parenthetical concord]
         iii Not in my car, you’re not.                                       [negative retort]
         iv I wouldn’t be surprised if it didn’t rain.       [pleonastic subordinate negative]
   Disjunctive coordination concord
   When a negative has scope over disjunctive coordination, it may be expressed verbally, as
   in Their action wasn’t (either) illegal or immoral, or non-verbally, in the coordination itself,
   as in [4i]. In the latter case it is generally incorporated into all markers of coordination,
   and we can therefore talk of concord or agreement in polarity. Occasionally, however,
   we find or instead of nor: Their action was neither illegal or immoral (see Ch. 15, §2.4).
   Parenthetical concord
   A further minor case is seen in [4ii], where semantically there is a single negation, just as
   there is in the non-parenthetical versions I don’t think they are here or I think they aren’t
   here. In the parenthetical version the negation is expressed both in the anchor they aren’t
   here and in the parenthetical I don’t think. The negation in the parenthetical, however,
   is optional, for we can also have They aren’t here, I think. The matching negation in [4ii]
   is comparable to the matching interrogatives in Are they here, do you know? (cf. Ch. 10,
   §5.3).
846      Chapter 9 Negation
        Negative retort
        Example [4iii] might be said by B in response to A’s saying I’m just driving into town.
        B’s response is thus a reduced version of You’re not driving into town in my car. The
        negated initial constituent represents new information, while the rest is discourse-old,
        recoverable from A’s utterance. The effect is to emphatically reject a proposition or
        proposal that is more specific than the one just uttered.
        Pleonastic negation in subordinate clauses
        Example [4iv] is ambiguous between a reading with two semantic negations (“It would
        not come as a surprise to me if I were to learn that it didn’t rain”) and the one we
        are concerned with here, where there is only one semantic negation (“I wouldn’t be
        surprised if it rained”). In this second interpretation the negative in the subordinate
        clause is pleonastic, an extra mark of something that has already been marked – in this
        case, in the matrix clause. Other examples are:
       [5]    i No one can say what might not happen if there were another earthquake.
             ii He is unable to predict how much of it may not turn out to be pure fabrication.
        The range of constructions where this pleonastic not is found is very restricted. In [4iv]
        the pleonastic not is in the protasis of a remote conditional where the apodosis has a
        negated expression of surprise (cf. also I wouldn’t wonder if . . . ). In [5i–ii] it is in an
        interrogative clause headed by modal may. In all three examples the subordinate clause
        containing pleonastic not is strongly non-factual.","[865, 866]"
"          27
               A further case of mismatch between syntactic and semantic scope is to be found in the position of adverbs.
               Although the order illustrated in He must always/never have filed the letters represents the usual one, it is also
               possible to have the adverb before the auxiliary, as in He never/always must have filed the letters. Must here
               has its epistemic sense, roughly “I am forced to conclude”. And it is clear that the frequency adverbs relate
               semantically to the filing, not to the epistemic judgement: the meaning is “I am forced to conclude that he
               always/never filed the letters”, not “I am always/never forced to conclude that he filed the letters”. Semantically,
               then, it is comparable to He promised always to do his best, although the order matches that of He always
               promised to do his best: the semantic contrast between the two promise examples is lost with must.
                                                           § 4.2.2 The catenative-auxiliary analysis           1215
      The argument has both a negative and a positive side to it. The negative side involves re-
      considering the differences between ask and have presented in the last section as supporting
      a dependent-auxiliary analysis, and showing that on closer examination they do not in fact
      do so. The positive side involves introducing other phenomena which can be handled more
      satisfactorily under the catenative analysis.(a) The distinction between argument and non-argument subjects
      The first point we made was that while ask takes an argument subject, have does not. But as
      we in fact noted when discussing this difference, it isn’t only auxiliary verbs that take non-
      argument subjects: verbs such as seem, appear, begin, tend do so too. The following examples
      with seem thus match the above ones with perfect have in [13–15]:28                                                                  

          It is also important to note that the concept of catenative can be applied to adjectives as
      well as to verbs. Adjectives like certain, likely, eager, keen take non-finite complements, and
      can be chained together recursively in the same way as catenative verbs: cf. She is likely to be
      keen to accept or (with a mixture of verbs and adjectives in a chain of four catenatives) She
      is likely to at least appear to be keen to try to win. And catenative adjectives show the same
      split between those that take argument subjects and those that take non-argument subjects.
      Compare:                                                                      

          b. The PM was likely to be intimidated by Kim.
         Furthermore, this split is to be found in the class of auxiliaries too: it is not quite true
      that all auxiliaries take non-argument subjects, for dare and the would of would rather take
      argument subjects:                                                              
  [24] i a. Neither dare interview the PM.
                                                                               [voice-sensitive: a = b]
         b. The PM daren’t be interviewed by either.
       ii ∗The piano-lid daren’t be open.                                  [selection restrictions apply]
      iii ∗There daren’t be any dust on the piano.                             [dummy there excluded]
         What we find, then, is the cross-classification shown in:
  [25]        argument subject                      non-argument subject
            i dare, would (rather)                  be, can, have, may, need                   [auxiliaries]
           ii expect, hope, try, want               appear, begin, seem, tend                [lexical verbs]
          iii anxious, determined, keen             apt, certain, liable, likely                [adjectives]
      The contrast in the semantic relation to the subject thus provides no basis for treating
      auxiliaries differently from lexical verbs. Moreover, the behaviour of dare and would (rather)
      is inconsistent with the dependent-auxiliary analysis: they are clearly heads, not dependents.(b) Negation
      Although the core auxiliary construction normally has just one negation, the possibility does
      in fact exist for contrasts in syntactic as well as semantic scope and for negating more than 28
      We have changed the non-finite complement of [13] because both Kim seemed to interview the PM and The
      PM seemed to be interviewed by Kim sound somewhat unnatural. They are equivalent, nevertheless.
1216         Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clauses
            one verb at a time. Compare:
        [26] i She can’t always answer his questions, can she?                         [negation of can]
               ii She can always not answer his questions, can’t she?               [negation of answer]
              iii She can’t always not answer his questions, can she?          [negation of both verbs]
        There is an equivalence between [i] and It isn’t always possible for her to answer his questions,
        is it? : the negation clearly includes the can/possible within its scope semantically, and the
        interrogative tag shows that it does so syntactically too – the standard type of tag reverses
        the polarity of the clause to which it attaches (cf. Ch. 9, §1.1).
            By contrast, [26ii] is equivalent to It is always possible for her not to answer his ques-
        tions, isn’t it? (“to refrain from answering”), where the can/possible is now outside the
        scope of the negative, hence positive, as reflected in the negative tag. And [iii] is equiv-
        alent to It is not possible for her to always not answer his questions, is it? The two neg-
        atives here do not of course cancel each other out because they are negating different
        verbs; the tag is the same as in [i], because it is determined by the polarity of the can
        clause.
            The always in these examples makes it easy to see the scope of the negatives. If we omit
        it, there is no longer anything in the linear sequence of elements alone to determine the
        scope: She + can + not + answer his questions could in principle have either the first or
        second interpretation. The second requires a special prosodic reading in which there is a
        break after can and the not is closely linked to answer ; in writing cannot would force the
        first interpretation, whereas can not would tend to be used for the second. An inflectional
        negative always indicates that the negative has syntactic scope over that verb: She can’t answer
        his questions unambiguously has the first interpretation.
            The same range of possibilities is even available with perfect have:
        [27] i He has not always accepted bribes, has he?                                        [negation of have]
             ii He has always not accepted bribes, hasn’t he?                                  [negation of accept]
            iii He has not always not accepted bribes, has he?                             [negation of both verbs]
            Have is negated in [i] and [iii], where has not is replaceable by inflectional hasn’t, but in
            [ii] the have clause is positive (as evident from the tag), and the not belongs syntactically as
            well as semantically with accept : “It has always been his practice to not accept (i.e. to refuse)
            bribes”.
                Examples like [26ii/27ii] are just like the earlier [16iib] (She asked not to be included in
            the survey), and the catenative analysis enables them to be handled in just the same way, as
            non-finite complement negation, secondary negation in the sense of Ch. 9, §2.3. This is not
            possible in the dependent-auxiliary analysis, where they have to be treated as exceptions. The
            above contrasts show that the proposed VGp does not in fact form a unit with a single syntactic
            negation. It is true that examples like [i] represent the normal pattern, but the catenative
            analysis caters more satisfactorily for the range of options that the verbal system makes
            available.29 (It should also be borne in mind that in the ordinary catenative construction
            negation of the matrix is much more frequent than negation of the complement.) Other       29
            Attested examples of the construction shown in [iii] are rare, but the following is a slightly more complex
            version of it: Not since 1992 had Sampras not taken at least one among the Australian Open, French Open,
            Wimbledon and the US Open. The initial negative phrase negates the have clause, while the second not negates
            the take clause.
                                                      § 4.2.2 The catenative-auxiliary analysis          1217
  examples of secondary negation after auxiliaries are given in:
 [28] i He will sometimes not answer the phone.
      ii You should just occasionally not give everyone the benefit of the doubt.
     iii They are always not accepting new orders.","[1234, 1235, 1236, 1237]"
"  47
       The idiom so far can be used either deictically or anaphorically. The deictic use is seen in I have so far
       marked about half of them (“up to now”); the anaphoric use in I had so far marked about half of them (“up to
       then”).
1536          Chapter 17 Deixis and anaphora
       (a) Pro-clause complement with finite antecedent: I think so
           [58] i A: Are they putting the price up? B: I think so. / I’m afraid so. / It seems so.
                ii She thought he was wrong but was too polite to say so.
               iii She was totally opposed to the idea and told the premier so.
               iv Will she accept the recommendations, and if so how will they affect us?
             So here stands for a clause in complement function: we understand “I think they are putt-
             ing the price up”, and so on. The understood clause is always declarative, though the an-
             tecedent can be interrogative, as in [i/iv]. This construction is found with the conditional
             preposition if, the adjective afraid, and a fair number of verbs, a sample of which are
             given in:
          [59]       appear            assume               believe              fear               gather            guess
                     hope              imagine              presume              reckon             regret            say
                     seem              suppose              suspect              tell               think             trust
             Appear and seem take impersonal it as subject: it seems so. Many of the others allow
             passivisation, with so then in extraposed subject position: It is believed so, etc. Verbs
             which, by contrast, do not allow so to substitute for a clausal complement include confirm,
             doubt, realise, resent.48
                 A number of the verbs in [59] also allow it or that as a pro-clause anaphor. In most
             cases there is a fairly clear difference in meaning between so and these NPs. It is particu-
             larly clear in 1st person singular present tense examples like I believe so vs I believe it/that.
             With I believe so the main issue is the truth of the antecedent proposition: I might well
             use this in response to a polar question to give a modally qualified positive answer. With
             I believe it/that the main issue is whether I believe the proposition concerned (and this
             time the antecedent could hardly be interrogative). The difference emerges very sharply
             if we add yes. In Yes, I believe so, the yes relates to the proposition expressed by so; in
             Yes, I believe it/that the yes relates to the matrix proposition: “Yes I do believe”. Or take
             the verb regret. I regret so is understood as “Yes, regrettably”, while in I regret it/that the
             truth of the proposition expressed by the complement is taken for granted, and what is
             asserted is that my attitude to it is one of regret.
             Polarity: so and not
             So normally expresses a positive proposition, with not being used as the corresponding
             negative pro-form. In response to Will Kim be there?, for example, I hope so is understood
             as “I hope Kim will be there” and I hope not as “I hope Kim will not be there”.49 There
             is likewise a straightforward contrast with if between positive so and negative not. With
             say and tell, however, so readily substitutes for a negative clause and not is quite rare and
             often inadmissible outside responses to questions:
          [60] i She didn’t approve of the idea and told them so/∗not.
               ii A: Will they be accepting the proposal? B: She says not.","[1555, 1556]"

      5.2 The use and interpretation of tags
        Reversed polarity tags
         The illocutionary force of an utterance with the form anchor + tag depends on the
         prosody. The two principal patterns both have falling tone on the anchor; the tag itself
         is either rising or, more frequently, falling:
         [10]         positive anchor                          negative anchor
                 i a. He was here, wasn’t he?              b. He wasn’t here, was he?            [rising tag]
                ii a. He was here, wasn’t he?              b. He wasn’t here, was he?           [falling tag]
         (a) The rising tag
         This expresses doubt or asks for verification: the question is biased towards an answer
         that confirms the anchor. A special case, involving a negative anchor, is prosodically
         distinguished by a somewhat wider pitch movement and the lack of any rhythmic break
         between anchor and tag. Here there is no such bias towards an answer with the same
         polarity as the anchor:
         [11]      It isn’t raining again, is it?   It isn’t my turn already, is it?
         If anything, there is a bias towards a positive answer, but in addition the construction
         has an emotive component of meaning – a suggestion of being afraid that the positive
         answer is the true one.
         (b) The falling tag
         The version with falling intonation on the tag does not express doubt: the question merely
         seeks acknowledgement that the anchor is true. Thus it can be used in a context where
         the anchor is obviously true: Good gracious, you’re up early this morning, aren’t you?,
                                                                           § 5.3 Parentheticals   895
   uttered at 4 a.m., say. There may be, as perhaps in this example, an implicit invitation
   to provide an explanation (Yes, I’ve got a train to catch). Or I may want you to admit
   something you didn’t previously accept (I was right all along, wasn’t I?). Or again I
   might be asking for your agreement to some minor uncontroversial proposition (It’s
   a lovely day again, isn’t it?). Thus an exclamative anchor will normally take a falling
   tag because I can hardly ask you to confirm my exclamation: What a mess I’ve made of
   things, haven’t I? With an exclamative the truth of the proposition is not at issue (see
   §8.2), so that such an anchor is inconsistent with the expression of doubt. The falling
   tag may therefore have the character of a rhetorical question, where an answer-response
   is unnecessary.","[914, 915]"

      A further case is in predicative AdjPs modified by so, as in %It was so not funny. This is a relatively new
      construction, characteristic of the informal speech of younger speakers.
808       Chapter 9 Negation
            There are severe restrictions on what quantifiers take not as modifier in this construc-
         tion (cf. Ch. 5, §11). Compare:
         [4]    i not all       not every       not many         not much       not often
               ii ∗not both    ∗
                                not each       ∗
                                                not most         ∗
                                                                 not some      ?
                                                                                not any
         In clauses with verbal negation each, most, and some do not readily occur within the
         scope of negation. The salient interpretation of I hadn’t read most of it, for example, is
         “Most of it I hadn’t read”. There is therefore little need for a phrase that explicitly brings
         them within the scope of a negative.
             Both can occur readily enough inside the scope of verbal negation: I couldn’t afford
         both of them. But there is still little need for a phrase combining not with both. Suppose
         two swimmers have attempted to swim the Bering Straits but have not both succeeded.
         If we want to express the quantification in the subject we would very likely be in a
         position to say Neither of them succeeded or Only one of them succeeded, which are
         more informative, and hence generally preferable to the inadmissible ∗Not both of them
         succeeded.
             Not any is of doubtful acceptability. Normally one would instead use no or none, as in
         None of her friends had supported her, but not any is marginally acceptable as an emphatic
         alternant: ?Not ANY of her friends had supported her.      (b) Not one
         [5]   i Not one person supported the proposal.
              ii They had found not one mistake.
         Not one has a somewhat wider distribution than the items in [4i], in that it can occur
         post-verbally, as in [5ii]. We can also have not in combination with a or a single: They
         had found not a single mistake.      (c) Not two, etc.: “less than’’
          [6] i Not two years ago this company was ranked in the top ten.
              ii He was here not ten minutes ago.
         Not behaves differently in combination with numerals denoting numbers higher than
         one than in (b) above. In the first place, not two, etc., are largely confined to measure
         phrases, of time, distance, and the like. They could not replace one in such examples as
         [5ii]: ∗They found not two mistakes. Secondly, not in [6] marks subclausal negation: the
         clauses are positive, as evident from the lack of inversion in [i], and the reversed polarity
         tags, which would be wasn’t it? and wasn’t he? The clauses in [5], by contrast are negative
         (though not one or not a single . . . can also occur in measure phrases with subclausal
         negation). The interpretation of not in [6] is “less than”, and this sense is found also in
         such expressions as not an hour ago, not long before his death, not far from the post office,
         etc., which likewise do not mark clausal negation.      (d) Not a little, not a few
         [7]     His speech had caused not a little confusion.
         Not can also combine with the determinatives a little and a few. These have paucal
         meaning, and the effect of the not is to negate the low upper bound on the quantification,
                                                             § 3.1 Not as a marker of non-verbal negation                809
      giving “a fairly large amount/number” (compare the use of no in no small achievement in
      [29]). The negative thus has very narrow scope and the clause itself is positive – witness
      the tag hadn’t it ?(e) Not even, not only
    [8] i a. Not even Ed approved of the plan.                      b. Not only Ed approved of the plan.
        ii a. Not even then did he lose patience.                   b. ∗Not only then did he lose patience.
      Not commonly combines with the focusing adverbs even and only. Not even generally
      marks clausal negation: the tag for [ia] would be did he? Clause [ib], by contrast, is
      positive. A tag would be rather unlikely here, but the construction readily allows a
      continuation with a positive connective adjunct: Max approved of it too. In [ii] we have
      inversion in [a], whereas the inversion in [iib] is ungrammatical.10 The difference between
      not even and not only reflects the semantic difference: it follows from [ia] that Ed did not
      approve of the plan but from [ib] that he did approve of it. (In fact [ib] presupposes, takes
      for granted, that he approved of it: that is why it resists the addition of a confirmatory
      tag.)
         Not only marks clause negation when it functions by itself as a clause adjunct:
      [Not only was the acting appalling,] the movie was far too long.(f) Not very, not quite, etc.
    [9] i We had a[not very amicable] discussion.
         ii It somehow sounded [not quite right].
       iii I found his story [not wholly convincing].
        iv He spoke [not very confidently].
         v [Not very many of them] had been damaged.
      Not combines with various degree expressions that can modify adjectives, adverbs, or
      certain determinatives. In [i] it combines with an attributive AdjP, in [ii–iii] predicative
      AdjPs, in [iv] an AdvP, in [v] a DP. While [i–iv] illustrate subclausal negation, [v] is
      different: not very many behaves like not many in marking clausal negation and being
      limited to pre-verbal position.(g) Not unattractive: not with affixally negated adjectives
    [10] i Morton was in his early fifties and not unattractive to women.
         ii It was a not undistinguished private university with a large endowment.
        iii They had fixed the walls, and purchased some not inelegant furniture.
      In general, attributive adjectives cannot be negated directly by not: cf. ∗a not large house
      or ∗It looked not large. The not + adjective construction illustrated in [10] is permitted
      only when the adjective consists of a base preceded by a productive and transparently
      negative prefix. Note then that we cannot have ∗a not anarchic society, ∗several not intrepid
      explorers: anarchic and intrepid are etymologically divisible into negative prefix + base,
 10
      Not only then would not be fronted even without inversion: to give it prominence we would use the cleft
      construction with verbal negation: It wasn’t only then that he lost patience. Not even can occur with subclausal
      negation, and thus without inversion, when the focus is a measure phrase: Not even two years ago this company
      was ranked in the top ten, wasn’t it?
810           Chapter 9 Negation
             but this analysis is not synchronically transparent.11 A further condition is that the
             adjective must be gradable. This excludes examples like ∗a not immoral purpose, ∗this not
             uncrystalline substance, or ∗a not illegal act. In these uses the adjectives are classificatory
             rather than gradable: purposes are either moral or not, substances either form crystals
             or they do not, acts are either legal or not.
                There has been occasional prescriptive condemnation of the ‘not un·’ construction,
             though most manuals are perfectly clear in their view that it is fully acceptable. It would
             certainly be mistaken to imagine that attractive should or could be substituted for not
             unattractive to express the same meaning. The two have different meanings. The adjective
             attractive denotes an appearance that ranks towards the positive end of a scale that has
             ugliness at the negative end, beauty at the positive end, and a range of indeterminate
             looks in the middle. The un· reverses the orientation of the scale to give an adjective
             denoting an appearance ranked towards the lower end of the scale. The not yields a
             negation of being towards the lower end of the scale, suggesting an appearance ranked
             towards the positive end, but only guardedly so, since the middle of the range is not
             excluded, and the phrase is too cautious to suggest that the user intended to indicate a
             high degree of beauty:

          [12] i Not unexpectedly, Charles was late for the meeting.
               ii Not unreasonably, he asked for payment in advance.
              iii Not surprisingly, they didn’t want any part of it.
             Again, adverbs cannot in general be negated directly by not: cf. ∗Not stupidly, he asked for
             payment in advance. The exceptions illustrated in [12] are similar to those with adjectives
             in [10] – except that surprisingly (which is roughly synonymous with unexpectedly)
             accepts not even though it has no negative prefix. The not in [12] has scope over just the
             adverb: the clauses in [i–ii] are positive, while that in [iii] is negative by virtue of the
             verbal negation.      (i) Not with PPs
         [13] i Not at any stage of the proceedings did she contemplate giving up.
               ii Not for the first time, she felt utterly betrayed.
         Not can modify a limited range of PPs, resulting either in clausal negation as in [i],
         or subclausal negation, as in [ii]. The difference here is again shown by the pres-
         ence or absence of inversion. It correlates also with a difference in meaning: [i] en-
         tails that she did not contemplate giving up, while [ii] entails that she did feel utterly
         betrayed.","[827, 828, 829, 830]"
"        Interrogative clauses
         We have observed that NPIs are commonly found in closed interrogatives, and for these
         nothing need be added to what has been said above. Positive open interrogatives, however,
         require some further discussion.
         Open interrogatives
         The way NPIs interact with positive open interrogatives is slightly different from the way
         they work in the semantically simpler closed interrogatives. Compare the following:
         [29] i a. Who helped her?                          b. Who did anything to help her?
              ii a. Why did you help someone                b. Why would you lift a finger to help
                    like George?                                someone like George?
                                                               ∗
             iii a. How come you like her?                  b. How come you like her much?
         In general, questions expressed by means of positive open interrogatives have positive
         presuppositions. When I ask [ia] I normally take it for granted that someone helped her
         and aim to find out who it was. Similarly [iia] presupposes that you helped George and
         [iiia] that you like her.
             Introduction of an NPI, even one like any or ever, changes matters in various ways.
         It is not presupposed by [29ib] that someone did something to help her. It may suggest
         that no one did, though it doesn’t need to – cf. Who has any suggestions to make?, which
         leaves it entirely open whether anyone does in fact have any.
             In [29iib], with the more strongly negatively-oriented lift a finger, there is a negative
         implicature – that George doesn’t deserve help, so that a proper stance would be for you
         not to lift a finger to help him. In effect, the question asks for a reason for departing
         from that presumption.
                                                             § 4.4 Non-affirmative contexts       835
     Example [29iiib] is ungrammatical, like the positive declarative ∗You like her much.
  (Note the contrast with the fully acceptable How come you like her so much?) But again,
  there is no question of much being syntactically excluded from positive open interrog-
  atives: we merely need to find contexts with an appropriate negative flavour, as in Who
  cares much about it, anyway?
 Bare infinitival why interrogatives
 [30] a. Why tell them anything about it?           b. ∗Why not tell them anything about it?
  It might initially seem surprising that the NPI is permitted in the positive question [a] but
  excluded from the negative [b]. But again the explanation has to do with the conveyed
  meaning of the construction.
      Although positive, [30a] conveys the negative suggestion that there is no reason to
  tell them anything about it. The negative meaning of the clause that would express this
  negative implicature allows naturally for NPIs. With why not interrogatives, on the other
  hand, there is a positive implicature. The conventional meaning of Why not tell them
  about it? is to suggest via a rhetorical question that you should tell them about it. The
  positive sense of the latter makes the NPI in [b] unacceptable.","[854, 855]"
" Tags based on subordinate clauses
  Special provision must be made for the construction illustrated in:
 [8]       a. I think it’s legal, isn’t it?   b. I don’t think it’s legal, is it?
  In [a] the first constituent structure boundary is between I think it’s legal and isn’t it?: the tag is
  appended to the main clause I think it’s legal, which is in this sense the anchor. But the form of
  the tag is based on the subordinate clause it’s legal, so from this point of view it is the latter that
  is treated as anchor. This conflict reflects the mismatch between the grammatical structure of
  I think it’s legal and its communicative meaning. Grammatically, it’s legal is subordinate to the
  think clause, but communicatively it is the subordinate clause that is primary: I think simply
  expresses some modal qualification. The anchor is comparable to It’s probably legal, where
  the modal qualification is expressed in a grammatically subordinate way, by an adverbial
  adjunct, or It’s legal, I think, where the qualification is parenthetical: for both of these the
  procedure [7] would give isn’t it? as tag quite straightforwardly.
      Example [8b] is similar but has the added complication of negative polarity. Is it? is a
  reversed polarity tag, but the negative which it reverses is in the think clause. Again the form
  of the tag reflects the communicative meaning rather than the grammatical structure – by the
  process we call specificity increase (Ch. 9, §5) the negative is interpreted as applying to the
  complement of think (“I think it isn’t legal”), so the tag is positive, just as it is in It’s probably
  not legal, is it? or It isn’t legal, I think, is it?
894       Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
             Other expressions allowing the tag to be based on a subordinate clause complement
         include: I believe/suppose/guess/reckon; it seems/appears; it follows /this means; and so on
         (cf. It seems we made a mistake, didn’t we?; It follows that we won’t have to pay any more,
         will we?).","[913, 914]"
"
         13
              There is also an archaic alternant of nothing, namely naught. But as such it is now restricted to a handful of
              collocations, as in It availed him naught, It will come to naught. In AmE naught can also be a variant spelling
              of nought (“zero”), which is not syntactically a negation marker; it is discussed in Ch. 5, §7.6.
                                                                     § 3.2.1 Clausal negation   813
 Alternation with verbal negation constructions
  Clausal negation marked by the absolute negators is generally in alternation with verbal
  negation in which no is replaced by any in the case of [19i] and by either, or, and ever in
  the case of [19ii]. Compare:
 [21]          non-verbal negation                  verbal negation
          i a. They showed no remorse.           b. They didn’t show any remorse.
         ii a. We liked none of them.            b. We didn’t like any of them.
        iii a. You did nothing about it.         b. You didn’t do anything about it.
        iv a. I knew neither of them.            b. I didn’t know either of them.
         v a. He neither knew nor cared          b. He didn’t either know or care
               where his children were.             where his children were.
        vi a. She had never felt more alone.     b. She hadn’t ever felt more alone.
  There are three restrictions that apply to the alternation between the non-verbal and
  verbal constructions.
  (a) No verbal negation counterpart with negator in clause-initial constituent
  Where the negator falls within the subject or an element preceding the subject, there is
  no direct verbal negation counterpart:
 [22] i a. Nobody knew where Kim was.            b. ∗Anybody didn’t know where Kim was.
      ii a. At no stage did she complain.        b. ∗At any stage she didn’t complain.
     iii a. I didn’t go and neither did he.      b. ∗I didn’t go and either didn’t he.
  In the case of [iib/iiib], the ungrammaticality of the verbal negation construction can
  be corrected by placing the element in post-verbal position: She didn’t complain at any
  stage and I didn’t go and he didn’t go either.
  (b) Verbal negation counterparts with no in predicative complements
  Where no determines an NP in predicative complement function there may or may not
  be a verbal equivalent, depending on the interpretation of the negative NP. Compare:
 [23] i a. This is no place for a child.         b. This isn’t any place for a child.
      ii a. This is no time to give up.          b. This isn’t any time to give up.
     iii a. That is no way to behave.            b. That isn’t any way to behave.
     iv a. I’m no angel.                         b. ?I’m not any angel.
      v a. You are no electrician.               b. ?You’re not any electrician.
     vi a. He’s no friend, is he?                b. ?He isn’t any friend, is he?
  The examples in [i–iii] show the regular relationship between the two constructions,
  but in [iv–vi] the [b] versions are of questionable acceptability and in any case do not
  have the same meaning as the [a] versions. It is [iv–vi] that illustrate the usual pattern
  for predicative NPs with no: pairs like those in [i–iii] are largely limited to NPs with
  simple and basic head nouns like place, time, and way, and subjects like this or that.
  As discussed in Ch. 5, §7.8, the interpretations of the [a] examples in [iv–vi] involve
  the stereotypical qualities associated with the set that the head noun denotes: angels,
  electricians, and friends in this case. Thus to make [iva] true it is neither necessary nor
  sufficient that I should not be a member of the set of angels; the sentence claims that I
  do not have the stereotypical qualities of angels (perfect goodness, kindness, patience,
  or whatever). Analogously for [va/via]. For this sort of interpretation, the [b] versions
814    Chapter 9 Negation
      are not appropriate paraphrases; they convey the literal meanings that the [a] meanings
      lack; for example, [ivb] means “I am not any specific member of the set of angels”.
      (c) Limitation on distance between verb and negator
      In principle, non-verbal negators marking clausal negation can appear in any position in
      the clause. However, as the position gets further from the beginning of the clause and/or
      more deeply embedded, the acceptability of the construction decreases, simply because
      more and more of the clause is available to be misinterpreted as a positive before the
      negator is finally encountered at a late stage in the processing of the sentence:
      [24] i a. I am not satisfied with the proposal you have put to me in any way.
              b. ?I am satisfied with the proposal you have put to me in no way.
           ii a. As far as I can recall, I have not purchased food at the drive-through window of
                  a fast-food restaurant on any street in this city.
              b. ?As far as I can recall, I have purchased food at the drive-through window of a
                  fast-food restaurant on no street in this city.
          When the negator is in a subordinate clause, particularly a finite one, and is signifi-
      cantly far away from the matrix clause verb, it will typically not be interpreted as negating
      the matrix clause, but rather will be heard as negating the subordinate clause in which
      it is located. Compare, for example:
      [25] i I was not trying to imply that Bob had offered bribes to any official.
           ii I was trying to imply that Bob had offered bribes to no official.             [= [i]]
          iii I was trying to imply that Bob had not offered bribes to any official.       [= [ii]]
      Example [ii] is not synonymous with [i]: it is, rather, an alternant of [iii]. Compare
      also:
      [26] i I cannot recall actually seeing a magpie attempting to steal anything.
            ii #I can recall actually seeing a magpie attempting to steal nothing.     [= [i]]
      In [26i] there is an occurrence of anything in a subordinate clause with primary verb
      negation in the matrix clause. If the primary verb negation is removed and the anything
      in the subordinate clause is replaced by nothing, we get [ii], but this is not equivalent
      to [i]. Example [ii] is understood with subordinate clause negation, either of the steal
      clause or the attempt clause; e.g., picking the attempt clause as the scope, the meaning is
      “I can recall actually seeing a magpie not attempting to steal anything”. But seeing a bird
      not attempting to steal is hardly worth mentioning, so [ii] sounds bizarre.
          It is not entirely impossible for a negator in a subordinate clause to negate the matrix
      one, merely unusual. Where it happens, the subordinate clause will virtually always be
      non-finite, usually infinitival:
      [27] i I don’t know why they say they were forced to take their shoes off; [WE certainly
              forced them to do nothing of the kind].
           ii [We are requiring people to pay nothing for the concert,] but nonetheless we are
              hoping for at least some donations at the door.
      Here the negator is located in the underlined infinitival clause but marks negation of the
      bracketed finite clause, as shown by the equivalence with the verbal negation versions
      W E certainly didn’t force them to do anything of the kind and We are not requiring people
      to pay anything for the concert. In cases like this, then, the negative property percolates
      upwards from one clause into a higher one.
                                                                                   § 3.2.2 Subclausal negation           815
3.2.2 Subclausal negation
        We review here three situations in which absolute negators mark subclausal negation. (a) Negative NP as complement of preposition
     [28] i I could do a lot for this place with no money at all.
          ii Kim regretted having married someone with no ambition.
         iii It was a matter of no consequence.
         iv They were arguing about nothing.
          v She finished it in no time.
        The PPs in [i–iii] are semantically equivalent to clauses or PPs with clausal complements:
        compare even if I had no money at all, who had no ambition, which had no importance. And
        just as the negative in these latter constructions would not percolate upwards beyond the
        subordinate clause, so the scope of the negative in the PP examples does not percolate
        upwards into the containing clause. Example [iv] is, strictly speaking, ambiguous. It
        has an interpretation as clausal negation, equivalent to the verbal negative They weren’t
        arguing about anything; much more likely, however, is the meaning “They were arguing
        about something completely trivial”, and here the clause is positive (with weren’t they?
        as tag). In no time in [v] is an idiom meaning “extremely quickly”; it is an instance of
        hyperbole: a desirably small amount of time implying a very high speed is overstated
        as being zero and thus implying infinite speed. Also idiomatic is the PP in They were
        obviously up to no good.14 (b) No + mean, small, etc.
        [29]     Getting that degree was no mean achievement, wasn’t it?
        Here, in contrast to [28v], we have understatement: we understand “quite an achieve-
        ment”, a positive meaning. Similarly: His resignation was in no small measure involuntary,
        wasn’t it? (c) Semantically clausal NP                                                                     [ambiguously clausal or subclausal]
        [30] i They predicted no rain.
             ii They promised no increase in income tax.
        Example [i] has an ordinary clausal negation interpretation, equivalent to They didn’t
        predict any rain. But it can also be interpreted as subclausal negation, with the NP serving
        as a compressed expression of a clause, “They predicted that there would be no rain”.
        Similarly for [ii].15
 3.3 The approximate negators
        The class of approximate negators comprises the following seven words:
        [31] i determinatives:                few, little
             ii adverbs:                      rarely, seldom; barely, hardly, scarcely   14
        A non-prepositional idiom is no end, meaning “very much”, as in We enjoyed it no end and so did the others,
        or She had no end of a good time, didn’t she?
   15
        This type is not mutually exclusive with (a) above, for such NPs can occur as complement to a preposition:
        The weak US dollar is expected to weigh on equity and bond markets, despite no signs of inflation in Australia
        (“despite there being no signs of inflation”).
816       Chapter 9 Negation
             Few and little are determinatives. They function in NP structure as determiner (Few
         people liked it) or fused determiner-head (Few of them liked it). Few selects count plural
         heads, little non-count singulars. Little also functions as degree adjunct modifying verbs
         (He little understood the implications of what he had done) or comparatives (He felt
         little better). Few and little are the plain forms of the lexemes few and little, but the
         comparative and superlative forms ( fewer, fewest, less, least) do not behave syntactically
         as negators.
             The words in [31ii] are adverbs. Rarely and seldom are adverbs of frequency, while the
         other three are adverbs of degree, characteristically modifying verbs (She hardly moved),
         adjectives (He was barely intelligible), and a restricted range of determinatives (especially
         any: There was scarcely any food left).
             We refer to these items as approximate negators on the basis of such contrasts as the
         following with absolute negators or verbal negation:
         [32] i a. Few of them will survive.              b. None of them will survive.
              ii a. Ed rarely leaves the house.           b. Ed never leaves the house.
             iii a. She had hardly moved.                 b. She hadn’t moved.
         While the [b] examples indicate absolute zero, those in [a] express an imprecise quan-
         tification which is close to or approximates zero. However, the fact that the approximate
         negators do not indicate absolute zero gives them a somewhat equivocal status with
         respect to the positive vs negative contrast. Take [iia], for example. This entails that Ed
         doesn’t often leave the house, that he leaves the house no more often than occasionally,
         and in this respect has a negative meaning. On the other hand, it implicates that he
         sometimes does leave the house: in this respect it differs from [iib] and has to some ex-
         tent a positive character. We will attempt to shed some light on the status of these forms
         by considering three issues: the nature of the “not zero” implicature, their likeness to
         prototypical negators with respect to what we will call the ‘direction of entailment’, and
         their behaviour in the constructions we have used to distinguish between negative and
         positive clauses. Few and little contrast with a few and a little, which are unequivocally
         positive, and it will help clarify the status of few and little to show how they differ from
         a few and a little in these three areas.      (a) Nature of the “not zero’’ implicature
          As imprecise quantifiers, the approximate negators cover a range of the relevant scale of
          quantification. In general, they entail that the upper bound of that range is not high but
          only implicate that the lower bound is not zero. We can show the relations between a
          few and few in relation to multal many and the absolute negator no in a diagram. The
          arrows stand for two different relations according to the labels: ‘E∼’ means ‘entails the
          falsity of ’ and ‘I∼’ means ‘implicates the falsity of ’.

"
     5.4 Pragmatic presupposition
        Finally, we consider the relation of presupposition, exemplified in:
        [11] i She has stopped trying to secure her son’s release.
             ii She hasn’t stopped trying to secure her son’s release.          [all presuppose [iv]]
            iii Has she stopped trying to secure her son’s release?
            iv She formerly tried to secure her son’s release.
        Presupposition has to do with informational status. The information contained in a
        presupposition is backgrounded, taken for granted, presented as something that is not
        currently at issue. In [11] all of [i–iii] presuppose that she formerly tried to secure her
        son’s release: what is at issue is not whether she tried to secure his release in the past but
        whether she is doing so now.
           This example brings out an important property of presupposition, namely that it
        is generally unaffected by negation or questioning. When a sentence is negated, the
        negation characteristically applies to that part of the content that is presented as being at
                                                                               § 5.4 Pragmatic presupposition                41
 issue. If she in fact never tried to secure her son’s release, [ii] is strictly speaking true, but
 it would normally be a very inefficient or misleading way of conveying that information.
 A simpler, more direct and more explicit way of doing so would be to say She never tried
 to secure her son’s release. The fact that I didn’t say this but said [ii] instead will lead you
 to infer that the negation applies to the stopping, so that [ii] implicates that she is still
 trying. Similarly with questioning. If I didn’t know, and wanted to find out, whether she
 formerly tried to secure her son’s release, I would be expected to ask Did she try to secure
 her son’s release? If I ask [iii] instead, the natural inference will be that I am trying to find
 out about the present state of affairs.
     The kind of reasoning just described is similar in kind to that invoked in discussing
 conversational implicatures, reflecting the fact that both phenomena are pragmatic.17
 Like conversational implicature, presupposition applies in the first instance to utterances,
 but we can apply it derivatively to sentences with the same ‘normally’ qualification as
 before:
 [12] X normally presupposes Y ≡ in saying X the speaker, in the absence of indications
         to the contrary, takes the truth of Y for granted, i.e. presents it as something that
         is not at issue.
     Again, then, we allow that in special circumstances a presupposition may be cancelled.
     Consider, for example, the following exchange:
 [13]         A: Have you stopped using bold face for emphasis?
              B: No I haven’t (stopped using bold face for emphasis); I’ve always used small caps.
     A’s question presupposes that B formerly used bold face for emphasis. But suppose it
     turns out that A was mistaken in believing this. B answers the question with a negative,
     and since this reflects the form of the question it too would normally presuppose that B
     formerly used bold face for emphasis. But in the context given here that presupposition
     is cancelled.
         The presupposition associated with the verb stop coincides with an entailment when
     X is positive and declarative, as in [11i], but with a conversational implicature when X
     is negative or interrogative, as in [11ii–iii]. You cannot stop doing something that you
     have never done before, so [11i] cannot be true unless [11iv] is true. This gives the latter
     the status of an entailment. But it is not an entailment of the negative [11ii], as evident
     from the example in [13]. Nevertheless, if I say [11ii] I will normally be taken to have
     implicitly committed myself to [11iv], and the latter therefore counts as a conversational
     implicature. Likewise with the interrogative [11iii], which does not have entailments.
         This represents the most usual pattern for presuppositions. For the most part they are
     entailed if X is positive and asserted to be true, and otherwise they are conversationally
     implicated. But this is not a necessary feature of presuppositions: we will see that they
     do not always follow this pattern.","[60, 61]"
"       Negative quantifiers
        The scale in [22] cannot be expanded by adding anything to the right of some. In
        particular, we cannot continue with no. Compare the following pair with [18] above:
       [26]     a. Some of her friends voted for him.           b. None of her friends voted for him.
        Example [b] doesn’t implicate the negation of [a] (It is not the case that some of her friends
        voted for him): it entails it. No is thus not a weaker quantifier than existential some : it
        combines negation with existential quantification, and for this reason it does not belong
        on the scale of positive quantifiers given in [22].
           Few is likewise to be excluded by virtue of being negative. The relation between many
        and few is comparable to that between some and no:
       [27]     a. Many of her friends voted for him.           b. Few of her friends voted for him.
        Again, [b] entails the falsity of [a] rather than merely implicating it. Note, then, the
        difference in the following:
       [28] i Some if not all / indeed all of her friends voted for him.
            ii ∗Few if not many / indeed many of her friends voted for him.
        If not all in [i] cancels the “not all” implicature of some by admitting the possibility that
        all voted for him, while indeed all cancels it by asserting that all did. But these devices
        cannot cancel the “not multal” entailment of few.
            Few, however, does not mean “less than many”: it means “the opposite of many”.
        Many and few are antonyms, like good and bad, big and small, old and young, etc. We
        noted above that negating many tends to yield a paucal interpretation. Compare, then:
       [29]     a. He didn’t obtain many votes.                 b. He obtained few votes.
        Example [a] conveys that he obtained a small number of votes. But this is an implicature:
        it could be that he received a fair number of votes but nevertheless somewhat fewer
                                                             § 5.2 Scalar entailments and implicatures             367
     than would merit the description many. Few, however, could not be used in this latter
     scenario: [b] entails, rather than merely implicating, that he obtained no more than a
     small number of votes. Thus [a] and [b] are not equivalent: [b] entails [a], while [a]
     implicates [b].18
        As a negative, few enters into a scalar relation with no, and if we consider just pro-
     portional uses we can also include not all on the negative scale even though it is not a
     single word:
 [30]         no       >       few        >       not all
     We put no on the left because it is the strongest of the three, in the sense of being most
     restrictive. Compare:
 [31] i None of her friends voted for him.                                                [entails [ii–iii]]
      ii Few of her friends voted for him.                     [entails [iii], implicates negation of [i]]
     iii Not all of her friends voted for him.                            [implicates negation of [i–ii]]
     The truth conditions for [i] are narrower, more restrictive, than those for [ii], and the
     latter are in turn more restrictive than those for [iii].
         The entailments and implicatures deriving from [30] follow the same principles as
     with the positive scale [22]. The stronger terms entail the weaker, while the weaker
     implicate the negation of the stronger, as indicated in the annotations given on the right
     in [31]. The implicature from few to “not none” is often very strong, like that from some
     to “not all”, and this is likely to be the case in the particular example we have here. But
     in other cases it is clearer that we are dealing with an implicature, not an entailment.
     Suppose, for example, we are about to mark a set of exam papers. I might say Few will
     do as well as Kim Jones in last year’s exam: of that we can be quite sure. This expresses
     confidence that at most a small number will equal Kim’s (outstanding) performance last
     year, but it doesn’t say that at least some will do so. The “not none” implicature can
     be cancelled in the same way as was illustrated for the “not all” implicature of some in
     [28i]:
 [32]         Few if any /indeed none of them did as well as Kim.
 A few and few
 These are both paucal quantifiers in that they involve a low upper bound. But they
 contrast as positive vs negative (cf. Ch. 9, §3.3). This results in the differences summa-
 rised in:
 [33]                                             a few            few
       i Upper bound is low                       implicated       entailed
      ii Lower bound is greater than zero         entailed         implicated
     (A few entails, in fact, that the lower bound is greater than two.) Notice, then, that a few
     works in just the opposite way from few with respect to the cancellation of implicatures.
     Compare [28ii] and [32] with:
 [34] i A few if not many / indeed many of her friends voted for him.
      ii ∗A few if any / indeed none of them did as well as Kim.","[386, 387]"
"   Restrictions on closed interrogatives
    In the default case, contexts which accept open interrogatives also accept the closed
    type too, and vice versa. There are, however, contexts where the open type is admissi-
    ble but where closed interrogatives are either: (a) of questionable acceptability; or (b)
982         Chapter 11 Content clauses and reported speech
           completely excluded. We will refer to these as involving respectively weak and strong
           answer-orientation.
           (a) Marginal status of closed interrogatives in contexts of weak answer-orientation
       [42]              question-orientation                               weak answer-orientation
                 i    a. Did she say if the door was locked?
                                                                          b. ?She said if the door was locked.
                         She didn’t say if the door was locked.
                 ii   a. Does he know whether it is ready?
                                                                          b. ?He knows whether it is ready.
                         He doesn’t know whether it is ready.
           The [b] examples here are significantly less natural and acceptable than the [a] ones. If
           I know that [ib] is true, then I will typically also know either that she said the door was
           locked or that she said it wasn’t locked – and in that case the expectation would be that
           I would use a declarative complement. She said that the door was locked and She said
           that the door was not locked are clearly more informative than [ib], and hence if I’m in
           a position to say one or other of these I would normally do so. Analogously for [iib].
           The [a] examples involve non-affirmative contexts (interrogatives, negatives, etc.), and
           a number of the verbs governing interrogative complements occur most readily in such
           contexts. But it must be emphasised that this is a matter of pragmatically motivated
           preference, not of a syntactic rule. Compare, for example, [42iib] with He must know
           whether it is ready: this is still an affirmative context, but it is more acceptable than [42iib]
           because the must makes it more likely that the speaker doesn’t know whether it is ready
           and hence is not in a position to use a declarative instead of the interrogative. Compare,
           similarly, He knows whether it is ready but he won’t tell me.
              The distinction between non-affirmative and affirmative contexts is of much less
           significance for open interrogatives. Affirmatives like She said what she plans to do or He
           knows why she resigned, for example, do not have the questionable status of the closed
           interrogatives in [42].
           (b) Exclusion of closed interrogatives in contexts of strong answer-orientation
           Some governing expressions license open but not closed interrogatives:
       [43]              closed interrogative                                open interrogative
                  i a. ∗It’s amazing whether he wrote it.                 b. It’s amazing what he wrote.
                 ii a. ∗He realised if she meant you.                     b. He realised who she meant.
           The [a] examples here are not improved by making the matrix clause non-affirmative:
           ∗
            Is it amazing whether he wrote it? ; ∗He didn’t realise if she meant you. The governors
           generally take declarative complements with a factive interpretation: It’s amazing that
           he wrote it and He realised she meant you presuppose respectively that he wrote it and
           that she meant you (cf. §7.4).13 Note also that [ib] conveys that I know what he wrote –
           similarly with It’s surprising, I’m amazed, etc. Another item which belongs here is the
           preposition considering : while the verb consider licenses a closed interrogative (We were
           considering whether we should accept the proposal), the converted preposition allows
      13
           An exception is the complex governing expression you wouldn’t believe, as in You wouldn’t believe who she’s
           going to marry. You wouldn’t believe that she is going to marry Fred does not involve the same exclamatory use
           of you wouldn’t believe and is not factive.
                                                                                                § 5.3.3 Dubitatives         983
        only a declarative or an open interrogative (Considering what the conditions were like, it
        was a creditable performance, but not ∗Considering whether it was her first attempt, . . . ).
        Similarly with given, except that here the verb from which it is converted does not take
        content clause complements at all.
           Non-factive careful, take care behave in the same way: Be careful what you say but not
        ∗
         Be careful whether they see you. Instead of the latter we need a declarative: Be careful they
        see / don’t see you.
   Subject–auxiliary inversion
        Some varieties of English (quite widespread in the USA) allow subordinate interrogatives
        with subject–auxiliary inversion in contexts of strong question-orientation:
    [44]              inverted order                                      uninverted order
                    %
               i a. She asked what had she done wrong.                  b. She asked what she had done wrong.
              ii a. % He wanted to know was she ill.                    b. He wanted to know if she was ill.
             iii a. ∗ He didn’t know was she ill.                       b. He didn’t know if she was ill.
        In [i] we have the open interrogative construction, with the two versions differing just in
        respect of subject–auxiliary inversion; [ii] has closed interrogatives, marked by inversion
        alone in [a], but by whether or if in the uninverted version. The inverted construction is
        limited to a subset of the question-oriented contexts – to contexts of what we are calling
        strong question-orientation. This is seen in the contrast between [iia] and [iiia]: both want
        to know and not know allow emotive modifiers like on earth (He wanted to know / didn’t
        know why on earth she put up with it), but only the former allows inversion. The inverted
        construction is more characteristic of non-standard speech, but examples are certainly found
        in Standard English.
           The inverted construction represents a blurring of the distinction between subordinate
        and main clauses. It is not to be equated with the main clause construction illustrated in
        [21ii], for this time the question is not cited: [44ia], for example, involves indirect reported
        speech, not direct (such as we have in She asked, ‘What have I done wrong?’ ). We treat it
        therefore as a subordinate clause, recognising that in this variety inversion does not always
        distinguish main from subordinate clause interrogatives.","[1001, 1002, 1003]"
"       4.2.1 The dependent-auxiliary analysis
           Since the NICE properties are found with a few verbs which clearly take complements, as
           in the non-core uses illustrated in [9], these properties cannot provide the justification
           for taking the core auxiliaries as dependents rather than heads: the special treatment of
           core auxiliaries must be based on other factors.
          General motivation for the dependent-auxiliary analysis
           These other factors can be brought out by comparing the following constructions:
           [10] i Ed had a busy morning: he read the report.                     [sequence of main clauses]
                ii Ed says that he read the report.                                   [finite subordination]
               iii Ed asked to read the report.                                  [non-finite subordination]
               iv Ed had read the report.                                           [auxiliary construction]
           (a) Sequence of main clauses
           In [10i] there are two main clauses; they are of equal syntactic status, neither being subordinate
           to the other. This relational independence is reflected in the internal independence of the
           two clauses. That is, each selects independently of the other for tense, polarity, clause type,
           subject, and so on. This is illustrated for polarity in:
           [11] i Ed had a busy morning: he read the report. (=[10i])                   [positive + positive]
                ii Ed had a busy morning: he didn’t read the report.                   [positive + negative]
               iii Ed didn’t have a busy morning: he read the report.                  [negative + positive]
               iv Ed didn’t have a busy morning: he didn’t read the report.           [negative + negative]
           Similarly for subject selection: as it stands, the subject of the second clause is related anaphor-
           ically to that of the first, but the two subjects could be quite unrelated, as in Ed had a busy
           morning: the phone rang continuously. And so on: there are no grammatical limitations on
           either clause imposed by the other.
           (b) Finite subordination
           As we move down to [10ii], we find that this internal independence of the two clauses has
           diminished, though to a relatively modest extent. Here, that he read the report is a subordinate
           clause serving as complement to say: there is therefore a clear structural interdependence in
           that one clause is functioning within the structure of the other. By virtue of its subordination,
           the read clause loses its potential illocutionary force. That is, in uttering [ii] I do not assert
           that he read the report (as I normally do if I utter the simple sentence He read the report): I
           don’t make two separate assertions, as in [i], but a single composite assertion. Related to this
           is the fact that the choice of clause type in the complement clause is restricted. It would not be
           possible to have an imperative clause here. And a closed interrogative is just about excluded
           too (?Ed says whether he read the report ) though it would become completely normal if we
                                                       § 4.2.1 The dependent-auxiliary analysis          1211
  made the main clause negative or interrogative (Ed doesn’t say / Does Ed say whether he read
  the report?), an indication of the interdependence between the two clauses. In other respects,
  however, the read clause has the same range of options available as in a main clause: the
  options for tense, polarity, subject, for example, are unaffected by the subordination (cf. Ed
  says that the boss doesn’t read the reports, which differs in all three of these respects).
  (c) Non-finite subordination
  Moving from [10ii] to [iii] takes us from a finite to a non-finite subordinate clause, and
  non-finites have a reduced range of clausal options open to them. Non-finite clauses tend
  to be significantly less explicit than finite clauses: components of meaning that in finites
  are directly expressed are in non-finites often left to be derived from the context in which
  the clause appears. The non-finite has no inflectional tense – and no possibility therefore of
  including a modal auxiliary (the possible contrast in [10ii] between that he may/must/can/will
  read the report is not available in [iii]). Instead, the superordinate verb contributes a great deal
  to the interpretation of the lower clause: in [iii], for example, the reading is merely potential
  and in a time sphere subsequent to the time of asking, whereas in Ed remembered to read the
  report it is actual and not temporally separable from the remembering. Like most non-finites,
  the read clause of [iii] has no overt subject – but the understood subject is retrievable from
  the superordinate subject Ed.
  (d) The auxiliary construction
  Finally, when we come to [10iv], the range of structural options available is further reduced, so
  much so (the argument goes) that it is no longer justifiable to talk in terms of two clauses, one
  embedded within the other. Historically it is a two-clause construction, comparable to [iii],
  but the two clauses have lost their separate identities, merging together into a single clause.
  This evolution has been accompanied by a reinterpretation of the direction of grammatical
  dependence, with have now dependent on read, rather than the other way round.
     The reduced independence of have and read in [10iv] relative to that of ask and read in
  [10iii] is reflected in a number of ways, most notably [12i–iii], which we examine in turn:
 [12] i Ask takes an argument subject, whereas have takes a non-argument subject.
      ii With ask there is a very clear distinction between negating ask itself and negating the
         complement, but have does not follow the same pattern.
     iii Ask and its complement show a greater degree of temporal independence than we
         find with have and the following verb.","[1230, 1231]"
" Nor with subject–auxiliary inversion
  The following non-correlative use of nor differs from that in [50ii] in that nor is not here
  replaceable by or :
 [51] i The Germans haven’t yet replied; nor have the French.
      ii He didn’t attend the meeting, nor was he informed of its decisions.
     iii He was one of those people who can’t relax. Nor did he have many friends.
     iv The hotel had good views and a private beach; nor were these its only attractions.
  In this use nor introduces a clause (normally a main clause) and triggers subject–
  auxiliary inversion. Some speakers allow a preceding and or but (cf. %The Germans
  haven’t yet replied and nor have the French), so that for them nor here is a connective
1310          Chapter 15 Coordination and supplementation
             adverb, like the neither that could replace it (. . . and neither have the French). For many,
             however, this nor cannot combine with and and but,30 and hence is again best regarded
             as a coordinator, though it very often occurs in sentence-initial position, as in [51iii].
                 This use also differs from that in [50ii] with respect to polarity. In [50ii] the first
             coordinate is within the scope of a negative; in [51] the first clause is usually negative,
             as in [i–ii], but in relatively formal style it need not be. In [iii] the first clause contains
             a negative but it is within the subordinate clause: the main clause itself is syntactically
             positive, though it has an obvious negative entailment, “He couldn’t relax”. In [iv],
             however, the first clause is completely positive.","[1329, 1330]"
"2.5.9 Use
        This is the most marginal of the auxiliaries. For many speakers, especially younger ones,
        it does not belong in the class at all; many others have it as both auxiliary and lexical verb
        (with the former belonging to somewhat more formal style). We therefore find both:
        [65] i a. % He usedn’t to like it.             b. % Used he to live alone?                      [auxiliary]
             ii a. He didn’t use to like it.           b. Did he use to live alone?                  [lexical verb]
        Choice between the negative variants is sometimes avoided in informal style by using
        never : He never used to like it. The version with analytic negation, He used not to like it,
        could be construed either as an auxiliary with primary verb negation, or else as a lexical
        verb with negation of the non-finite complement. Usedn’t is pronounced without an
        internal /t/ and sometimes written usen’t ; similarly used to is pronounced with a single
        /t/ and hence is homophonous with the use to of [ii], and the spelling used is sometimes
        found instead of use in these negative and inverted constructions.
            Use does not normally appear as an auxiliary in the emphatic polarity or stranding
        constructions:
        [66] i ∗He claims neither of us used to reply but we USED to.          [emphatic polarity]
              ii ∗Kim used to like it and I used    as well.                      [verb stranding]
        Contrastive stress on use can only emphasise the past aspectual meaning, not the polarity,
        so the only possibility in [i] is but we DID. In [ii] the only possibilities are to-stranding
        (and I used to as well ) or do (and I did, as well ).
            Morphologically, use is highly defective: it has no present tense, no gerund-participle,
        and no past participle.25 The plain form is found only in construction with auxiliary do,
        as in [65ii]. We have seen that it is mutually exclusive with the modal auxiliaries, but it is
        clearly not itself a member of the modal auxiliary class. It lacks properties [I] and [K–M],
        while [J] is irrelevant because used is a preterite form so the issue of agreement doesn’t
        arise. It is also semantically quite distinct from the modal auxiliaries: the meaning it
        expresses is aspectual, not modal.",[135]
"      The scope of negation
      One important issue in the interpretation of negatives concerns the scope of negation:
      what part of the sentence the negation applies to. Compare, for example, the interpre-
      tation of:
      [4] i Not many members answered the question.               [many inside scope of not]
           ii Many members did not answer the question.         [many outside scope of not]
       These sentences clearly differ in truth conditions. Let us assume that there are a fairly large
       number of members – 1,000, say. Then consider the scenario in which 600 answered,
       and 400 didn’t answer. In this case, [ii] can reasonably be considered true, but [i] is
       manifestly false.
          The difference has to do with the relative scope of the negative and the quantification.
       In [4i] many is part of what is negated (a central part, in fact): “The number of members
       who answered was not large”. In [ii] many is not part of what is negated: “The number
       of members who didn’t answer was large”. We say, then, that in [i] many is inside the
                                                      § 10 Clause type and illocutionary force    61
  scope of not, or the negation, or alternatively that the negative has scope over many.
  Conversely, in [ii] many is outside the scope of the negation or, alternatively, many has
  scope over the negation, since it applies to a set of people with a negative property.
     In [4] the relative scope of not and many is determined by the linear order. But things
  are not always as simple as this. Compare:
  [5]     i You need not answer the questionnaire.                   [need inside scope of not]
         ii You must not answer the questionnaire.                  [must outside scope of not]
        iii I didn’t go to the party because I wanted to see Kim.                 [ambiguous]
  In [i] the negative has scope over need even though need comes first: “There isn’t any
  need for you to answer”; in [ii], by contrast, must has scope over the negative: “It is
  necessary that you not answer”. In abstraction from the intonation, [iii] is ambiguous as
  to scope. If the because adjunct is outside the scope of the negation, it gives the reason
  for my not going to the party: “The reason I didn’t go to the party was that I wanted
  to see Kim (who wasn’t going to be there)”. If the because adjunct is inside the scope of
  negation, the sentence says that it is not the case that I went to the party because I wanted
  to see Kim (who was going to be there): here there is an implicature that I went for some
  other reason.","[80, 81]"
"       Negation
       To the extent that degree adjuncts can combine with clausal negation, they normally fall
       within its scope:
       [22]    I don’t fully understand what you mean.                [adjunct in scope of negation]
       The meaning here is “It is not the case that I fully understand what you mean”, not
       “I fully fail to understand what you mean”. Where there is a need to quantify the degree
       of a negative situation it is usually expressed lexically rather than by clausal negation:
       [23] i a. He very much dislikes them.         b. ?He very much doesn’t like them.
            ii a. I absolutely reject the idea.      b. ?I absolutely don’t accept the idea.
       Nevertheless, narrow scope negation is not entirely excluded:
       [24]    I very much don’t want you to go with them.            [negation in scope of adjunct]
          Where the adjunct is within the scope of the negative, we need to distinguish between
       ordinary and metalinguistic negation (see Ch. 9, §1.2):
       [25] i I don’t like her much.                                            [ordinary negation]
            ii I don’t rather like her: I absolutely adore her.            [metalinguistic negation]
       The first clause in [ii] could normally only be used in a context where it had been sug-
       gested that I rather like her: the negative rejects that proposition not because it is false
                                                                          § 12 Cause and result      725
  but because it falls short of indicating the degree of my liking her. In what follows we
  ignore cases of this kind and consider below only narrow scope ordinary negation.
  Maximal degree
  One case is illustrated in [22]: the negative indicates “less than fully” , with an implicature
  that the degree is still high (i.e. not very much less than fully). Negation of quite implicates
  “almost”: I don’t quite agree entails that I don’t agree, but suggests that I’m not far from
  doing so. This is also the interpretation when it’s a matter of reaching some endpoint, as
  in I haven’t completely finished. Examples like I absolutely adore her, where the verb itself
  indicates high degree, do not permit ordinary negation.
  Multal and moderate degree
  The multal case is illustrated in [25i], and similarly They don’t meet a great deal or He
  wasn’t badly wounded. Negation indicates a lower degree than that expressed by the
  adjunct – and this will usually be interpreted as quite low, in the paucal range. Thus
  while [25i] is consistent with my liking her moderately, it generally implicates a lower
  degree than that. Many of the multal degree adverbs resist ordinary negation. Take He
  bitterly regretted it, for example: in the negative we would be much more likely to use
  much than bitterly, giving He didn’t regret it much. The moderate degree items are also
  unlikely to occur with a negative; note here that quite has the maximal interpretation in
  negation, not the moderate one.
  Paucal, minimal, and approximating degrees
  A little and slightly likewise resist negation. A bit, by contrast, is commonly negated, and
  then behaves like the minimal items at all, etc. They didn’t enjoy it a bit /at all indicates
  a zero degree of enjoyment, as does the less emphatic They didn’t enjoy it. Little, barely,
  hardly, scarcely, being themselves negative, do not occur in the scope of another negative.
  Ordinary negation is also normally incompatible with the approximating items almost,
  etc.
  The relative subgroup
  These readily undergo negation. He hadn’t studied enough to scrape a pass, the negative
  of [21i], indicates a lower degree than the lower bound defined by the positive and hence
  entails that he didn’t scrape a pass. He hadn’t been worrying too much to be able to sleep
  indicates a lower degree than the upper bound defined by the positive and hence entails
  that he could sleep. But too much can occur in the negative with a paucal meaning when
  there is no explicit or implicit infinitival complement: I didn’t enjoy it too much is simply
  an informal alternant of I didn’t enjoy it very much.","[744, 745]"
"      The grammatical relationship between the corresponding clauses in [21] and [22] is, how-
      ever, in some cases quite loose. Although we can say that the polarity is changed (positive
                                                                                             §.5.2 Modification         643
      to negative and negative to positive), and that such features as tense, aspect, and mood are left
      unchanged, there is no simple syntactic manipulation of the clauses in [21] that systematically
      yields the clauses in [22]. For example, if we change [21viii] in the same way as [21iii], we get
      the anomalous #I can think to advise staying home.","[662, 663]"
"
 9.6 Non-imperative directives
9.6.1 Interrogatives as directives
     Directives are very often conveyed indirectly by means of interrogatives. This is espe-
     cially so with requests – particularly when speaker and addressee are not intimates. The
     imperative structure, we have noted, can be used for a wide range of directives, including
     orders: to make a request by means of an imperative may therefore run the risk of ap-
     pearing too brusque or peremptory, even if illocutionary modifiers like please and kindly
     are added. In many circumstances indirect directives with interrogative form are con-
     sidered more polite. This is not to suggest that there is any simple correlation between
     interrogative form and politeness with directives. In the first place, prosody plays an
     important and in part independent role: Can you move your car? will typically be more
     polite than Move your car, but this can be overridden by an impatient, emphatic tone of
     voice. Secondly it depends on the content of the interrogative: Can you move your car
     lends itself much more readily to use as a polite request than, say, Must you park your car
     across my driveway?
        We find a great variety of interrogative directives, but four of the most important
     semantic categories concern: (a) your ability to do something; (b) your desire or willing-
     ness to do something; (c) the deontic necessity for you to do something; (d) the reason
     for you to do something:
     [42] i Can you open the door. (“Open the door”)                                          [ability]
          ii Would you like to / Will you sign here? (“Sign here”)                [desire/willingness]
         iii Must you talk so loud? (“Don’t talk so loud”)                         [deontic necessity]
         iv Why don’t you bring your radio? (“Bring your radio”)                              [reason]
940       Chapter 10 Clause type and illocutionary force
         (As noted in §3.2, there is some variation with respect to punctuation, with a full stop
         often preferred to a question mark in the ability or desire/willingness cases.)      (a) Ability questions
          These lend themselves to indirect directive use since a likely reason for me to be interested
          in your ability to do something is that I want you to do it. Typical openers are:
         [43]     can you, could you, is it possible ( for you), will/would it be possible (for you), are
                  you able, will/would you be able
         The versions with can are most frequent, and are especially likely in contexts where the
         answer is obviously “yes”, so that the direct inquiry force is effectively lost; this will usually
         apply with such everyday examples as Can you pass the salt, etc. The forms with preterites
         (could/would, with the preterite indicating tentativeness) are regarded as more polite.
            All the above could be negated: can’t you, couldn’t you, etc. Negative questions are
         always biased, and in the present case the negation adds some emotive component of
         meaning, perhaps impatience (Can’t you talk a little louder?, suggesting you ought to be
         able to) or persuasiveness (Couldn’t you stay a little bit longer?). Inflectional negatives
         always have the ability predicate within their scope; analytic ones with can are potentially
         ambiguous as to scope. Can you not stand by the door, for example, can have the not in
         the can clause or in the stand clause. In the first case it is a negative question conveying
         the positive directive “Stand by the door”, and in the second it is a positive question
         conveying the negative directive “Don’t stand by the door”.      (b) Desire/willingness questions
          These likewise have a natural connection with directives: if you want or are willing to do
          something you are likely to comply with a request to do it. Typical formulae are:
         [44] i will/would you, would you like to / care to / be so kind as to       [+ infinitival]
              ii do/would you mind                                            [+ gerund-participial]
         Again the tentative preterite would adds to the effect of politeness. (Note that want occurs
         in this use with do but not would, and is appreciably less polite: Do you want to clear
         the table so that we can have lunch?) Inflectional negatives are possible for those taking
         infinitival complements, especially the first three (won’t/wouldn’t you, wouldn’t you like
         to); they do not occur with mind, for the salient bias of the question would be positive,
         suggesting that you do/would mind. The analytic negatives will/would you not have the
         scope ambiguity illustrated above for can. Compare:
         [45] i Will you not [take a seat]?                                            [not in will clause]
              ii Will you [not put your feet on the sofa].                             [not in put clause]
         The pragmatically salient interpretations have primary verb negation in [i], “Take a seat”,
         and secondary negation in [ii], “Don’t put your feet on the sofa”.
            Closely related to desire/willingness is prospective intentional future, as in Are/Aren’t
         you going to tidy your room? These express doubt as to whether you intend to do what
         you should do, and for this reason are quite well down the politeness scale.      (c) Deontic necessity questions
          Deontic necessity is usually questioned by must, as in [42iii] or have (Do you have to talk
          so loud?), though need, necessary, etc., are also possible (cf. Need you / Is it necessary to talk
          so loud?). The situation denoted in the complement clause (your talking so loud) is one
                                                                § 9.6.2 Declaratives as directives     941
     that I regard as undesirable, and the question has, in context, a clear negative bias: I don’t
     think there is any necessity for you to talk so loud. Hence the implied directive – whose
     content is this time the opposite of that expressed in the complement clause. Suggesting
     that you are unnecessarily doing what I don’t want does not of course make for a polite
     directive.  (d) Reason questions
      These are usually expressed by means of why and have been discussed in §4.5. Here again
      the content of the implicit directive is the opposite of that expressed in the question,
      whether the latter is negative, as in [42iv], or positive, as in Why accept less? (“Don’t
      accept less”).    3rd person
     The above examples all have you as subject, but just as imperatives can have 3rd person
     subjects, so can interrogatives with directive force: Will everyone remember to sign the
     register. It is also possible to have 3rd person subjects in examples like those given in [42]:
     Can he come a little earlier tonight?; Would he like to return my wrench?; Must they talk
     so loud?; Why doesn’t she bring her radio? These aren’t equivalent to imperatives because
     they are not addressed to the person(s) concerned, but can still have indirect directive
     force, suggesting that you should convey the directive to whoever is to comply.    1st person inclusive
     Interrogatives used with essentially the same force as 1st person inclusive imperatives
     generally begin with shall we or why :
     [46] i Shall we go for a swim?
          ii Why don’t we eat out tonight? Why waste our time on it?
     At the direct level, [i] is a direction question whose answers are expressed by 1st person
     inclusive imperatives: in context the question is biased towards the positive answer, “Let’s
     go for a swim”, which it therefore indirectly conveys.","[959, 960, 961]"
"        Negation
        With ask we find a sharp semantic and syntactic distinction between negating ask and negating
        its complement. Negation of the complement occurs most naturally with passives, so we may
        contrast [16ia–b], whereas with have we have the single negation [ii]:
        [16] i a. She didn’t ask to be included in the survey.                     [negation of ask clause]
                b. She asked not to be included in the survey.                  [negation of complement]
             ii    She had not been included in the survey.
        The dependent-auxiliary analysis treats She had been included in the survey as a single clause
        and hence predicts that there will be just one negation of it, as in [ii].
           With the modals, moreover, we find that the clear semantic contrast between [16ia] and
        [16ib] may be syntactically neutralised. Compare:
        [17] i You may not start yet.                                                  [external negation]
             ii You must not start yet.                                                [internal negation]
        As explained in Ch. 3, §9.2.1, we use the term ‘external negation’ for the interpretation where
        the negation has scope over the modal, and ‘internal negation’ for that where the negation
        is within the scope of the modal. Thus [17i] is comparable semantically to [16ia] in that may
        (here indicating permission) falls within the scope of the negative, so that we have negation
                                                                 § 4.2.1 The dependent-auxiliary analysis                1213
     of the modality: it says that you do not have permission to start yet. It differs syntactically
     from [16ia] because may is an auxiliary and can hence be negated directly, without do-
     support. However, [17ii] is comparable semantically to [16ib] in that must (here indicating
     requirement or obligation) is outside the scope of the negative. The meaning is “You are
     required not to start yet” rather than “You aren’t required to start yet”; what is negative,
     therefore, is not the modality but the propositional content that the modality applies to. This
     is why [17i–ii] effectively mean the same even though may and must themselves are of course
     very different in meaning. In spite of the difference in the semantic scope of the negative,
     however, they are syntactically alike, not just superficially in terms of the position of not, but
     more fundamentally in terms of their behaviour with respect to the tests for clausal negation
     set out in Ch. 9, §1.1; compare, for example:
 [18] i a. She didn’t ask to be included in the survey and nor/∗so did your brother.
         b. She asked not to be included in the survey and so/∗nor did your brother.
      ii a. You may not start yet and nor/∗so may your brother.
         b. You must not start yet and nor/∗so must your brother.
     In [ia] ask is negated and hence we have matching nor following, whereas in [ib] ask is positive
     and hence selects positive so following. But the parallel semantic difference between [iia] and
     [iib] is not reflected in this way: [17ii] no less than [17i] is treated as syntactically negative.
     This suggests that from a syntactic point of view You must start is a single clause, so that it
     has only one negative counterpart.","[1232, 1233]"
" General and language-particular definitions
  In criticising the traditional notional definitions, we assumed that they were intended to
  enable us to determine what expressions in English belong to the categories concerned.
  It must be emphasised, however, that most of the terms that figure in a grammatical
  description of English are not unique to English but appear in the grammars of other
  languages too – in some cases, in the grammars of all languages. There are therefore two
  issues to be considered in defining or explaining such terms. At one level there is the
  issue of what grammatical properties distinguish one category from another in English.
  We call this the language-particular level. This is the level we have been concerned with
  so far. A language-particular definition will enable us to decide which expressions in
  the language concerned belong to the category. At another level there is the issue of
  what principled basis we have for using the same grammatical terms in the grammars
  of different languages, given that the language-particular distinctive properties will vary
  from language to language. We call this the general level. The fact, for example, that the
  negative imperative Don’t be punctual requires auxiliary do while the negative declarative
  You aren’t punctual does not is clearly a specific fact about English: it belongs in the
  language-particular definition of imperative clause for English, but not in a general
  definition.
      It might then be suggested that the traditional notional definitions should be con-
  strued as applying at the general rather than the language-particular level. Certainly
  they are not intended to apply uniquely to English. But at the same time there can be
  no doubt that as they are presented in school textbooks, for example, they purport to
  be language-particular definitions: the student is meant to be able to apply them to
  decide whether a given word in English is a noun, whether a verb is in the preterite,
  whether a clause is imperative. In effect, the traditional definitions aim to work at both
  levels simultaneously, and our objection is that the levels need to be distinguished,
  and approached differently. At the language-particular level, as we have argued, it is
  necessary to focus on form: to specify the grammatical features that distinguish ex-
  pressions which belong to the category from those that do not. At the general level
  it is quite legitimate to invoke meaning: languages serve to express meaning, and it
32    Chapter 1 Preliminaries
     is rare to find grammatical distinctions that have no correlation at all with semantic
     distinctions.
         We need to make it clear when giving a general definition that it is to apply at
     the general level, not the language-particular. And we need to acknowledge that the
     correlation between grammatical form and meaning is typically complex rather than
     one-to-one. The general definitions we propose for the categories discussed above are
     as follows:
     [20] i noun:            a grammatically distinct category of lexemes of which the mor-
                             phologically most elementary members characteristically denote
                             types of physical objects (such as human beings, other biological
                             organisms, and natural or artificial inanimate objects)
           ii preterite:     a grammatically distinct inflectional form of the verb whose pri-
                             mary use is to locate the situation in past time (relative to the
                             time of utterance)
          iii imperative: a grammatically distinct clause construction whose members are
                             characteristically used to issue directives
     The move to an avowedly general definition, together with the reference to characteristic
     use of the most elementary members, enables us to avoid the vagueness of the term
     ‘thing’ (or ‘name’) in [16i]. The fact that such lexemes as rejection, arrival, idea do not
     denote physical objects is not a problem for a definition at this level. By virtue of the
     distinctive grammatical properties specified in the language-particular definition, these
     lexemes belong to the same category as girl, boy, daffodil, window, etc., and this category
     as a whole satisfies the general definition of noun because it contains lexemes like these
     last examples that do denote physical objects. Note that the abstract nouns rejection
     and arrival are morphologically derived from lexemes of another category (verb); mor-
     phologically elementary nouns, such as girl, boy, etc., characteristically denote kinds of
     physical object.
         Definition [20ii] allows for the fact that verb inflections often have more than one
     use. In [17ia] (The finals started yesterday), we have the past time use. In [17ib] (You
     said the finals started tomorrow) the preterite form started is within a subordinate clause
     functioning as complement to said: this is a case of what is traditionally called indirect
     reported speech. Your actual words will have been, say, The finals start tomorrow, but
     present tense start is shifted into the preterite started in my report. Another use of the
     preterite is seen in I wish the finals started tomorrow, where it indicates counterfactuality:
     we understand that the finals do not start tomorrow. Of these three uses, it is the one
     that indicates past time that is primary. The others are found only in special contexts,
     such as the complement of a preterite verb of reporting or the complement of wish. This
     verb-form therefore qualifies for the label preterite.
         Definition [20iii] likewise overcomes the problems we noted in [16iii]. The language-
     particular criteria assign Sleep well to the same category as Go to bed and Please open
     the door, and since most clauses with this form are normally used as directives we call
     the category imperative clause. Would you mind closing the door is excluded from the
     category at the language-particular level: it does not have the distinctive grammatical
     form of imperative clauses in English.

     The grammatical distinctiveness requirement in general definitions
     It will be noted that the general definitions in [20] all impose a condition of grammatical
     distinctiveness. This requirement means that the general term being defined will be
     applicable in the grammar of a given language only if it can be given a distinct language-
     particular definition in that language.
         A significant weakness of traditional grammars of English is that they incorporate a
     number of categories that in fact have no place in a grammar of Present-day English,
     although they are perfectly valid for Latin (and in some cases older stages of English).
     A simple example is provided by the dative case inflection. A traditional dictionary or
     schoolbook definition is given in [21i], while our proposed revision is given in [ii]:
     [21] i dative:            the case of nouns, etc., expressing the indirect object or recipient
          ii dative:           a grammatically distinct case characteristically used to mark the
                               indirect object
     Definition [i] suggests that in He gave Caesar a sword, for example, Caesar is in the dative
     case, as it is in indirect object function and expresses the semantic role of recipient. And
     that indeed is the analysis found in many traditional grammars and school textbooks
     (especially older ones). But Present-day English has no dative case. In the Latin coun-
     terpart of the above sentence Caesar has a different form (Caesarı̄) from the one it has
     when functioning as subject (Caesar) or direct object (Caesarem), so the distinctiveness
     condition of definition [ii] is satisfied for Latin. In English it is not satisfied: the form is
     simply Caesar whether the function is subject, direct object, or indirect object. There is
     no noun, not even a pronoun, with a distinct inflectional form for the indirect object,
     and hence no basis at all for including dative among the inflectional categories of the
     English noun.15
5 Semantics, pragmatics, and meaning relations     Few grammars even attempt to describe the ways in which sentences are formed without
     making reference along the way to meaning and how sentences express it. After all, few
     would take it to be controversial that a human language such as English is in some sense
     a system for framing thoughts and making meaningful messages expressible, and this
     would make it a natural supposition that meaning and grammar would be to some extent
     intertwined. This grammar, while not attempting a full and detailed semantic description
     of the language (which would be an unrealistically large and difficult enterprise), touches
     on the topic of meaning frequently. But as we will explain, we do not treat meaning as a
     unitary phenomenon.","[51, 52, 53]"
