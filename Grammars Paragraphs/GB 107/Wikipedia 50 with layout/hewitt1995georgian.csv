"3.6.5 Response Particles
Affirmative replies are indicated by diax, k'i, ho 'yes' (most formal,
neutral, least formal respectively). Negative responses are shewn by ara
'no' or vera 'no (Potential)'.",[108]
"5.1.14.2 Potential
Where negation is combined with the notion of ability (viz. 'cannot/could
not'), one can avoid using the unmarked negative adverb ar in association
with the lexical verb meaning 'X is possible for Y' by employing the special
potential negative form ver with an indicative of the very verb whose
action is stated to be impossible, e.g.
                                    SYNTAX                                571  txov+n+a-s       ver          äe-(Ø-)g-i-srul-eb
  request-DAT not(POT) PREV-(it-)you-OV-fulfil-TS(1st.PER.FuT)
  'I shall not be able to fulfil your request'

                                                   be.possible.for-TS(FuT)-it    prefixal passives, particularly in the Prešent, often inherently convey
the concept of potentiality. When they are so used, prescriptive grammar
requires they be negated not by the (now pleonastic) potential ver but by
the unmarked ar, e.g.
    gvino        ar (Ø-)e-sm-ev-a
   wine(NOM) not (X-)IOV-drink-TS-it
    'X cannot drink wine'
though in practice ver is not unknown.-5.1.14.3 unmarked
The neutral marker of negation is ar. Two points not already mentioned
need to be stressed about the function of this element. Past statements
which would be expressed by a verb in the Aorist Indicative if positive
switch to the Perfect when negated by ar, e.g.   šen-s       dge-ši ar ša-mo-(Ø-)m-rč-en-i-x-a+r
   your-AGR day-in not PREV-PREV-(you-)me-lag.behind-TS-PERF-
                                                             you-be
   brj-ol-a-ši
   battle-TS-MASD-in
   'In your day you did not fall short of me in battle'    This does not mean that the Aorist Indicative is never found with ar;
this coupling, however, conveys the nuance that the subject had no wish to
carry out the past action and in fact declined to carry it out, e.g.   p'olit'ik'+ur-i mizez-it         ar mi-(Ø-)i-g-es
   political-AGR      reason-INST not PREV-(X-)SV-receive-they(AOR)
   'For political reasons they refused to accept X'5.1.15 Commands
As stated in Chapter 4 (4.7.1.2.1), for all verbs apart from the verb of
motion, which has its own special imperative form, the imperative is
formally identical with the 2nd person (singular or plural) of the Aorist
572                          GEORGIANGRAMMARIndicative. 1st person exhortations and 3rd person jussives are expressed
by means of the (Prešent or Aorist) Subjunctive in the appropriate person.
For those verbs which have no Aorist Indicative, commands are expressed
by use of the Prešent Subjunctive in the 2nd person, e.g.   torem, (Ø-Ø-)i-c-od-e,                           cocxal-i    ver
   otherwise (you-it-)SV-know-IMPERF-SuBJ(PRES) alive-NOM not(POT)
   c'a-m-i-x-val! 7
   PREV-me-OV-you-go(FuT)
   'Otherwise, know that you shall not get away from me alive!'","[589, 590, 591]"

                               PREFACE
This work began with the aim, consistent with the general goal of the
Benjamin-SOAS series of which it is a part, of presenting the essential
structural characteristics of Georgian for the benefit of general linguists.
As it progressed, however, it turned into something more than this. It had
been my aim to write a reference grammar of Georgian after a further ten
years or so of study, but the request from the Series' editors, Professor
Thea Bynon and Professor Matt Shibatani, to contribute a description of
Georgian happened to coincide with an unforeseen rift in my relations with
Georgia which is unlikely to be repaired. And so, rather than continue to
study this language, to which I was introduced seriously in 1975 when I
travelled to Tbilisi as a Cambridge post-graduate student for a year of
intensive learning on a British Council exchange, as, now of necessity for
me, a virtual dead language, I decided that it was time to kill three birds
with one stone. In marshalling here the sum total of the knowledge that I
have acquired over the last twenty years I hope (a) to have satisfied the
faith placed in my ability by Professors Bynon and Shibatani to write a
grammar of use for the general linguist, (b) to have produced a worthwhile
reference-grammar (the first in English) that it had always been my desire
to compose, and (c) to end thereby the period when Georgian has
represented the main focus of my study and research. If I succeed in
easing even a few people's passage through the waiting mysteries, I shall
conclude the last 20 years to have been well spent.
                            CORRIGENDUMThe Georgian for 'you (will) seat (plural) X' is (da-)sx-am, and not (da-)a-sx-
am, as given throughout this work. The latter form does exist but in the
meaning 'you (will) seat (plural) X on Y', which is to say that the pre-radical
a-vowel functions fully as exponent of the Locative Version. The verb-form
(da-)a-sx-am may, of course, also mean 'you (will) pour (liquid) X'.
                      ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
During the two academic years (1975-76, 1979-80) I spent with The British
Council in Tbilisi as well as in the course of other trips, such as my 3-
month sabbatical there at the end of 1987 through the auspices of The
British Academy, I came to know many Georgians, Mingrelians and Svans
whom I regarded as dear friends and from whom I learned a great deal
about Georgian and Georgia, whether or not they were conscious of their
role as teachers! Under normal circumstances I would have been happy to
list them all in the expectation that it might have gratified them to see their
names in such a book. However, circumstances have changed, and, since I
would not wish to embarrass anyone, I shall merely say that my gratitude
remains undimmed and that any Kartvelian who is still interested in
receiving thanks from me may consider themselves included in this
anonymous list.
     Dr. Rieks Smeets (Leiden University) was kind enough to read an early
draft of chapter 5 and offer some helpful comments thereon. Thea Bynon's
advice was, as anyone who knows her would naturally expect, especially
valuable. Professor Donald Rayfield (Queen Mary Westfield, London
University) cast his experienced eye over the whole manuscript and was a
source of constant encouragement during the preparation of the work.
Mrs. Joyce Hutchinson exhibited great patience in bringing the text into
conformity with the requirements of the publishers, and SOAS was kind
enough to support this publication by generously reimbursing her for so
doing. Mrs. Catherine Lawrence of SOAS' Department of Geography
enthusiastically made her skills available by drawing the map for this
volume. And finally without the understanding of my long-suffering wife,
Zaira, and daughters, Amra and Gunda, for my almost umbilical attachment
to the computer-console while this book was gestating, its birth would have
been considerably delayed. I thank all concerned and alone take the blame
for any mistakes outstanding.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"5.1.13.6 Questions with raising
Questions of the type 'Who do you think will gain the victory?', which
involve the question-word being raised out of its own clause, are formed in
GEORGIANby asking two separate questions—the first takes the form 'How
do you think?', whilst the second asks the basic question with the question-
word remaining in its own clause, producing for this particular example:   ro+gor (Ø-?Ø-)pikr-ob?                  vin
   how     (you-?3rd.PER-)think-TS(PRES) who(NOM)
   ga-(?Ø-)i-marjv-eb-s?
   PREV-(?3rd.PER-)SV-be.victorious-TS(FuT)-X5.1.14 Negation
5.1.14.1 Prohibition
The negative particle reserved for making prohibitions is nu. It is used
with the Prešent Indicative (if the aspect is progressive) or with the Future
Indicative (if the aspect is momentary) for all three persons, e.g.   maga-s                  nu    ga-(Ø-Ø-)a-k'et-eb!

   'Don't do that!'
   nu gv-e-äin-i-al
   not we-IOV-fear-PRES-?it
   'let us not be afraid!'",[588]
"    The usual word for 'how?' is ro+gor. In the following example,
however, from Vazha Pshavela the interrogative sad 'where?' is substituted
for it:      čven,      adam+ian-eb-s, s a d      šgv-i-jl-i-a[-n]6              i+s+e

The second alternative, either a full clause or just the negative ara 'not',
is introduced by tu 'or'. The verb in the first clause has rising intonation,
whilst the second verb (or the negative ara) carries falling pitch, e.g.   bag-s         mo-(Ø-Ø-)rc'q'-av               tu    jroxa-s

   PREV-(you-it-)milk-TS(FuT)       or not
   'will you water the garden or milk the cow // ... or not?'5.1.13.4 'leading'
Questions expecting the answer 'yes' contain the particle xom with high-
falling pitch on the verb, e.g.      xom       lamaz-i-a              sa+kart+v+el+o?
      surely    beautiful-NOM-is       Georgia(NOM)
      'Surely Georgia is beautiful/Georgia is beautiful, isn't it?'    leading questions expecting the answer 'no' have this same particle in
association with the appropriate negative, e.g.      si+m+suk+n+e xom a r             (Ø-)a-k'l-i-a-t?
      fatness(NOM)              not    (3rd.PER-)lV-lack-PRES-it-Pl

always has the choice of repeating the original question with the

questions containing the words tu ara 'or not', and both end up with these
same words in the indirect question, which shews appropriate changes of

There is a great variety of strategies available to convey a fear. Perhaps
the simplest way to express a positive fear is to use the appropriate tense
of the indicative, preferably accompanied by the speech-particle and also
by either vai-tu 'woe if' or xom ar 'surely not?', e.g.     m-e-šin-i-a,       vai-tu rus-eb-i
     I-IOV-fear-PRES-it          Russian-Pl-NOM
     šmo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an(=me+tk+i)

62Ø                       GEORGIANGRAMMAR   / / gv-e-s-ev-i-an(-me+tk+i) / /        še-mo-gv-e-s-iv-
                                          nen(=me+tk+i)
       PRES                               AOR
   'I am afraid that the Russians will attack us // may be attacking us //
   may have attacked us'which may be alternatively expressed by replacing vai-tu by xom ar
placed after the SUBJect rus-eb-i. These two variants, which are based
on direct quotation, sit happily alongside any tense in the introductory
verb, so that replacing m-e-šin-i-a above by the past m-e-šin-od-a
would give the equivalents of 'I was afraid the Russians would attack us //
were attacking us // had attacked us'.
    An alternative is to turn the fearing clause into a negative wish (sc.
that something may not happen or may not be happening), which joins the
negative particle ar to the appropriate SUBJunctive (viz. Aorist for an
event in the future vs Prešent for one contemporaneous with the fear).
Such expressions may optionally be introduced by the complementiser rom
and optionally accompanied by the relevant speech-particle. The above-
example in this variation would be:   m-e-šin-i-a,     (rom)                    rus-eb-i           ar
   še-mo-gv-e-s-i-o-n(=me+tk+i) / /           gv-e-s-e-od-nen(=me+tk+i)

    'I am afraid lest your thinking too be corrupted'16   Note that this strategy is not available if the feared event precedes the

you going (sc. did you say)?', vin ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-á? 'Who did it (sc. did you

interrogative carries high-falling pitch (A: london-ši mi-v-di-v-a+r. B:
sàd(a)? 'A: I am going to London. B: Where?'). Yes-no questions take a
rise-fall on the final syllable of the verb, which will regularly be the final

governing a subjunctive verb.
    Another fossil, originally a finite verb meaning 'it is possible for X', is
e+g+eb(+i+s)/e+g+eb+a, which has as a synonym the parallel fossil from
the still very much extant verb 'it will be' i+kn+eb(+a). The meaning is
'maybe' and the associated verb is usually, though not necessarily,
subjunctive, e.g.   e+g+eb                 (Ø-Ø-)a-job-o-s,           rom a+ma+gam

   'maybe it's preferable that tonight you remain here'    Similar to the last two particles is vinjlo, which similarly governs the
Aorist Subjunctive. 11 means 'perhaps' but adds a note of encouragement
for the verbal activity, e.g.   vinjlo ar da-(Ø-Ø-)i-c'un-o                                č'iatura-c

"   The non-finite alternative consists of the postposition -tana+ve 'at the
very moment' governing the Genitive of the Masdar of the subordinate
verb, so that a further variant of the first clause above would be:

The sequence ma+s še+m+deg,                 ra+c (literally 'after    it, which')
introduces an indicative verb, e.g.    ma+s še+m+deg, ra+c            šen     ga-x-ved-i,

    'After you went out, the teacher fainted'   The allied notion of 'since + Past Tense Verb' is conveyed by the same
construction, though the postposition še+m+deg may be replaced by
uk'an 'behind' or by a+k+et 'on this side, over here', whilst the first two
words of the pseudo-conjunctional complex may yield to the phrase i+m
dro-i+dan 'from that time', e.g.      i+m dro-i+dan, ra+c            šen    mi-(Ø-)m-a-t'ov-e,

      'Since the time you left me 1 have been going around like a ghost'   The English concatenation of 'since' with the Progressive Perfect is
rendered simply by the use of ra+c, which is optionally omissible, with the
Prešent Indicative, e.g.      otx-i     c'el-i-a,      (ra + c) a+m saxl-Si v-cxovr-ob-t

      'It is 4 years (that) we have been living in this house'   Where the action of the subordinate verb is one that is amenable to
repetition, a negative may optionally be introduced into such temporal
subordinate clauses, e.g.      ra+m+den-i   c'el-i-a,            net'av,   ra + c      čven        (ar)

These concepts are conveyed by a choice between the two conjunctions
sa+na+m(de) and vi+d+re(+mde) (older variants being sa+na+mdis/
vi+d+re+mdis), both of which roughly mean 'upto where/which point', such
that the different temporal notions are reflected in the varying syntax of
the clauses themselves.5.2.2.1.7.4.1 'while'

The prešence of a negative in the main clause motivates the introduction
of one in the subordinate clause too, e.g.   ar mo-g-šor-d-eb-i,                                    vi+d+re+mdis

   'He would not (have) come out, until he (had) finished his domestic

reprešented indirect speech, the temporal clause would have to contain the

Notes1   lat'avra Gelenidze's Vocabulary Connected with the Anatomy-Physiology of
    Man in OldGEORGIAN(Tbilisi, 1974, inGEORGIAN)should be consulted by anyone
    interested in the OldGEORGIANvocabulary.
2   Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725) gives a rather interesting list of synonyms in his
    dictionary. I quote: 'sk'ore is the general term for the outpassings [ganavaltaj of
    creatures. But that of birds is called sk'int'li, that of fish t'urt'li, that of reptiles
    curcli, that of goats and wild goats k'urk'li, that of cows and water-buffalo nexvi
    and k'eli [N.B. ModernGEORGIANhas both k'eli and nak'elij, that of pigs čxrink'eli,
    that of horses and donkeys čončorik'i, that of dogs and beasts mčore, that of men
    mjgneri, dried excrement c'iva and pune, watery fæces t'rac'i, the droppings of a
    pigeon naedomi.' As for the basic term, is there a connection with Ancient Greek
    skč:r (Genitive skatčs) = latin stercus = Old Norse sklta = Anglo-Saxon scitan =
    English shit?GEORGIANalso uses the word p'at'ivi 'honour, respect' as a synonym
    (?euphemism) for nak'eli, nexvi. Note the play on words in the proverb: mic'a-s
    (Ø-)u-tkv-am-s: p'at'iv-i da-(Ø-Ø-)m-a-q'ar-e da p'at'iv-s da-(Ø-)g-a-q'r-i-
    o The earth apparently said: «Cast dung upon me and I shall cast honour [sc. in terms
    of a fine harvestj on you»'.
3   The preverb c'a- is given by Sulxan Saba Orbeliani, whilst (ga+)k'u+eb+a is given
    by Fähnrich/Sardzhveladze (199Ø). Because it is reminiscent of this verb, the plural of
    k'u 'tortoise' tends to be avoided — hence the attraction above the city of Tbilisi is
    called k'u-s t'ba Tortoise lake' rather than k'u-eb-is t'ba.
4   This verb is defined in Sulxan Saba Orbeliani's dictionary as: k'ac-ta-gan kal-is
    da-m+dab+1-eb-a 'the lowering (sc. corrupting) of a woman by men'. Dee Ann
    Holisky in her 1981 study Aspect andGEORGIANMedial Verbs' quotes (p.75) c'er-s 'X
    screws Y' vs c'er-a-ob-s 'X screws (intransitive)'. This root's non-slang meaning is,
696                              GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
      of course, 'write'. In Mingrelian part of the paradigm of (do-)xod-u-a falls together
      with that of the verb meaning 'sit down'. If in the Present b-xod-un-k is 'I fuck X'
      and b-xod-u-k is 'I sit down', in the Aorist do-b-xod-i should mean both 'I fucked
      X' and 'I sat down'. In fact, there seems to have been an attempt to avoid ambiguity
      by producing a new form for the commoner verb; Q'ipshidze's 1914 grammar quotes
      ko-do-do-b-xod-i as an alternative for the meaning 'I sat down', where, apart from
      the affirmative prefix ko-, the normal preverb has been reduplicated. When I myself
      was examining this verb some years ago in Ochamchira, one informant gave me the
      following paradigm: do-b-xod-u-k 'I sit down' vs (ks-)do-b-do-xod-u-k 'I shall sit
      down' vs (ke-)do-b-do-xod-i 'I sat down' vs the inverted do-m-Q-)xun(-u) 'I have
      sat down'. What seems to be happening is that, as is generally more common in
      Mingrelian than Georgian, the preverb is not restricted to the non-Present, so that the
      Present here begins with the root's normal preverb. In addition to the affirmative
      prefix, both the Future and Aorist shew reduplication of the normal preverb but with
      the difference from the form given by Q'ipshidze that the inner preverb has fused with
      the root, forcing the subject-marker to follow one instance of the preverb but precede
      the second.
5     Expressions for 'dying' (specifically 'the woman died') include the following: kal-i mo-
      k'vd-a = kal-i garda-i-cval-a = kal-ma sul-i gan-(0-?0-)u-t'ev-a (lit. X gave
      up the soul') = kal-ma c'er+il-i c'a-(0-)i-g-o (lit. 'X took the letter') = kal-ma
      sul-i da-(0-)l-i-a (lit. 'X drank the soul') = kal-s sul-i a-mo-(0-)xd-a.

"5.1.11 Reciprocals
Two reciprocal pronouns exist: e r t + m a n + e ( r ) t - i / e r t + i+me+or+e.
Though in origin compounds consisting of (a) a reduplication of the cardinal
ert-i 'one', with the first instantiation in the Ergative case, and (b) a fusion
of this same cardinal (this time in the Nominative) with the ordinal
me+or+e 'second', the words today simply function as object-fIIIers, much

With the adverb k'inagam 'almost' the verb may be either positive or (it is
suggested, as a result of Russian influence) negative, e.g.   k'inagam        sa+megr+el+o-s        sk'ol-eb-i+dan   kart+ul-i

"5.2.2.1.2 Result
The main clause contains an appropriate correlative (e.g. the equivalent of
'so', 'such a', 'to such an extent', 'so many', etc.), and the following
subordinate clause will begin with the conjunction rom 'that' in combination
with a verb in the indicative mood, e.g.      i+k   i+s+e+t-i     mgl-eb-i       da    t'ur-eb-i

adverb and by placing it immediately before the rom, we can start a
šentence which, though no longer subordinate, is stIII resultative, e.g.   axal+ga+zrč+oba-ši garda-i-cval-a.                  a+s + e        rom

   'He died in youth. And so (The result was that) he could not realise our
   hopes'    Esšentially the same construction as IIIustrated above for the basic
clause of result is employed as equivalent for English structures of the
form 'without V-ing', wherein the subordinate clause will of course contain
a negative, e.g.   i+s     mukta+xora m+gza+vr-ob-s xolme i+s + e, rom
   that parasite(NOM) travel-TS-he           usually so   that

   That parasite usually travels without buying a ticket'    Note how the ordering of correlative and subordinate clause can invert,
and how then the clitic r o m avoids c l a u š i n i t i a l position: i + s
mukta+xora m+gza+vr-ob-s xolme, bilet-s rom ar (Ø-)q'id(+)ul-

    Where the verb has a Privative Participle, it is often possible to
produce an alternative non-finite expression for the meaning 'without
VERBing' by placing the Privative Participle in the Adverbial case, any
direct object of a transitive participle going into the Genitive, e.g.   a+m ambav-ma, romel-i-c               šven     q'vela-m

It is sometimes difficult to draw a clear dividing line between purpose and
result. Such cases have a typical resultative correlative in the main

A range of conjunctions exists to mark causal clauses. Of those that
specifically indicate a reason the most colloquial is ra(+)k'i, the least
colloquial is vina+i+dan, whilst ra+d+gan(a+c) holds a middle position.
The mood of the verb will be indicative, and the ordering of main vs
subordinate clause is irrelevant, e.g.   nu           da-(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-i                         sxva-sa-o,

   'People say «Don't be mocking another as it will rebound upon your own
   head»'    In reply to a question incorporating the interrogative ra+t'om 'why?'
the answer normally begins with the sequence i+m+it'om rom 'for the
reason that/because', e.g.
582                         GEORGIANGRAMMAR   ra+t'om (Ø-)t'ir-i?             (ra+t'om da)        i+m+it'om     rom

   father(NOM) PREV-me-IOY-die-he(AOR)
   'Why are you crying? (If the question is 'why',) Because my father has
   died'   This same strategy can be used to indicate a cause within a main-
subordinate clausal sequence, e.g.      mt'r-isa i+m+it'om       m-e-šin-i-a,             rom si+k'vd+il-it

      'I am afraid of the enemy because (= for the reason that) he threatens
      me with death'    If i+m+it'om is followed by the emphatic particle k'i 'indeed' and the
accompanying verb is negated, the šentence is to be interpreted as one in
which the negative negates not the main verb but rather the reason
offered. And so, faced with the sequence mt'r-isa i+m+it'om k'i ar mr
e-šin-i-a, rom si+k'vd+il-it m-e-mukr-eb-a, the implication is that
there is a more compelling reason than his mere threats for me to fear the
enemy, such that the šentence could be continued with some such addition
as:      ara+me+d ra+d+gan čem-s p'ir+da+p'ir dg-a-s

"    Alternatively, the addition of ara 'no' at the end of a simple statement
turns that statement into the equivalent leading-question. The final syllable
of this negative has high-rising pitch. So, the last two examples could
alternatively be expressed respectively as:      lamaz-i-a  sa+kart+v+el+o, ara?
      si+m+suk+n+e ar (Ø-)a-k'l-i-a-t, ara?",[587]
"   Suffixed to the conditional conjunction tu the particle k'i gives us the
form tu-k'i meaning 'if indeed'.
   The element tu, possibly functioning alone as a sort of abbreviated
condition, can add the sense of 'if at all' to an expression, e.g.   bodiš-i          jnel-ad        tu mo-(0-)a-rč-en-s

with ara mxolo+d 'not only' (cf. 5.2.1), and tu ara da, which is
synonymous with both t o r e m 'otherwise' and the full expression
c'ina+ag+m+deg še+mtxv+ev+a-ši 'in the opposite circumstance', e.g.   cocxal-i   mo-[v-]val,              tu ara da mo-v-kVd-eb-i

   'I shall come (back) alive, otherwise I shall die'    We have met -ga in the sense of 'pray'. It can also mean 'only', in

c'in) mo-k'vd-a 'X died only the day before yesterday').    dae/de(e) (which derives from the imperative d a - ( 0 - 0 - ) e - x s e n

52.21.1 Purpose
Esšentially there is a choice between two strategies, a finite and a non-
finite. The finite involves the conjunction rom 'that' or the more archaic
ra-ta (from ra-yta 'through/by means of what') combined typically with (a)
the Prešent or Aorist SUBJunctive (depending on aspect), or (b) the
Pluperfect Indicative [sicj8. Combination (a) is usual after a non-past main
verb, combination (b) after a past tense verb. The subordinate clause
follows the main, e.g.

K'ldiashvili there is an example where both the notional direct and indirect

By the term 'potential' I mean clauses dependent upon introductory
expressions like 'must, ought, should, want, advise, try, be able, necessary,
possible, preferable, e t c . ' . If a finite reprešentation is required, then
where the proposition relates to the future, the Aorist SUBJunctive is used;
where it relates to the prešent, the Prešent SUBJunctive is used; where it
relates to the past, the Pluperfect is used. The complementiser rom is
optional. The Masdar serves as the non-finite reprešentation in such
expressions.
    The 3rd person Prešent of the verb 'want' (u-nd-a) has been
grammaticalised as the invariant particle of obligation. Prescriptively,
nothing can stand between it and its dependent finite verb—in other words,
rom is never used in this expression, e.g.      male u+nd+a            c'a-[v-jvid-e
      soon it.is.necessary   PREV-[I-jgo-AOR.SUBJ
      'I must go soon'   Should u-nd-a be functioning as the 3rd person Prešent of 'wish', then
rom is optional and other material too may separate main from subordinate
verb, e.g.      masp'injel-s (Ø-)u-nd-a,           (rom) male c'a-[v-jvid-e
      host-DAT      (he-)OV-want-it      that soon PREV-[I-]go-AOR.SUBJ
      The host wants me to go soon'    If the SUBJects of the introductory and subordinate verbs are co-

"1.3 The History of Georgian PhilologyThe earliest known work in Georgian to deal with philological issues in the
language, namely A Treatise on Articles, was discovered by Mzekala
Shanidze (1984) as part of the 11th-12th century manuscript No.6 from the
collection of the I veron Monastery on Mt. Athos, a work she tentatively
attributes to the scholar Eprem Mtsire. Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725)
produced the first native dictionary in 1716, whilst the first grammar of the
6                         GEORGI AN GRAMMARlanguage written in Georgian belongs to Zurab Shanshovani (1737), followed
in 1753 and 1767 by versions of a more comprehensive description by
Patriarch Ant'on I (1720-1788). A number of grammatical works appeared
through the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was essentially in the
writings of T h e Father of Modern Georgian Philology', Ak'ak'i Shanidze
(February 1887-March 1987), that Georgian grammar finally came of age.
His monumental Fundamentals of the Georgian Language, most recently re­
printed in 1980, will long remain the ultimate reference for all students of
Georgian morphology once they have gained a reading-knowledge of the
language. The Georgian Academy published the 8-volume Explanatory
Dictionary of the Georgian Language (KEGL, in abbreviation of its native
title, viz. kart+ul-i en-is gan+mart'+eb+it-i leksik'on-i) between
 1950 and 1964 under the general editorship of Arnold Cikobava, who
contributed his own grammatical sketch in volume 1. I ndeed, it has to be
said that the preparation of this grammar was greatly facilitated by the
invaluable information provided by this magnificent work, for apart from
using the volumes to check the existence and morphology of many of the
verb-forms quoted, I made lavish use of the illustrations included in the
various articles consulted, many of which are quoted as presented, though
in other cases I reduced the content for concentration on the feature in
question. Working so intimately with these volumes over the months, I
came to appreciate even more than I had before just how indispensable
they are for any serious student of Georgian. I know that this dictionary
has been the target of a good deal of criticism over the years, but I am
happy to speak strongly in its defence here. It has the unparalleled
advantage over any other dictionary of Georgian in its inclusion of so much
illustrative material from attested usage. One of the great desiderata in
Kartvelology is for a really good bilingual dictionary including illustrative
material of just this kind, and the first step in any such project would
surely be to render the Georgian definitions in KEGL into some appropriate
second language (like English!) and then to publish the result in a single
volume with a greatly reduced size of font on good quality thin paper, after
the fashion of The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. If such a project
could be financed, at least two observations should be borne in mind: (i) the
long quotes from the published works of Stalin that rather burden volumes
 1-4 could usefully be pruned or replaced, and (ii) since citations are with
3rd person subject (and object(s)), it is not always possible to predict the
form of a verbal root in some paradigms when the subject (or direct object)
is 1st or 2nd person (e.g. given ga-(Ø-)č'r-a 'X cut Y/them', it is not
possible to predict that 'I cut X/them' is ga-v-(Ø-)č'er-i with root
expanded by -e-), so that this information should either be given as part of
                              INTRODUCTION                                  7the citation for relevant verbs, or appropriate examples should be included
in the illustrative materials, which goal KEGL does not always achieve—
see the suggestions along these lines I made in Hewitt (1991a). Without
KEGL whatever value the present volume may have would have been
considerably diminished. Useful articles will also be found in the ongoing
series Questions on the Culture of Georgian Speech, whose 9th volume
appeared in 1989. Numerous dialectal words are contained in the various
volumes of Materials on the History of Georgia's Domestic Industry and
Craftsmanship (in Georgian), which began publication in 1976.
     Foreign investigation of Georgian began in the 17th century with the
work of Italian missionaries—for the history of the study of Caucasian
languages in general see (the Mingrelian) Arnold Chikobava (1965). In 1629
there were published in Rome the Alphabetum Ihericum, sive Georgianum,
cum Oratione Dominicali and S. Paolini's Georgian-Italian Dictionary. In
 1643 M. Maggio followed these with his Georgian Grammar. Facsimiles of
these three bibliographical rarities were published in Tbilisi in 1983 under
the title First Printed Books in Georgian (Xelovneba). F. Bopp, M. Brosset
and H. Schuchardt dealt with aspects of Georgian in the 19th century, and
in 1904 A. Dirr produced his short Theoretisch-praktische Grammatik der
modernen georgischen [grusinischen] Sprache (Leipzig). More recent works
that may be consulted with profit are: G. Deeters Das           kharthwelische
 Verbum (Leipzig, 1930), K. Tschenkéli Einführung in die georgische Sprache
(Zürich, 1958) in two volumes, as well as his             Georgisch-Deutsches
 Wörterbuch in three volumes (1965-1974), which is easily the most
outstanding of any of the bilingual dictionaries currently available, H. Vogt
 Grammaire de la langue géorgienne (Paris, 1971), H. Aronson Georgian—A
Reading Grammar (Chicago, 1982 & 1990)2, H. Fähnrich Kurze Grammatik
der georgischen Sprache (Leipzig, 1986), whilst for Old Georgian there is
this same scholar's 1982 German translation of A. Shanidze's short Grammar
of the Old Georgian Language (both the original (1976) and the translation
published in Tbilisi) as well as in his own right a grammatical sketch of
 1991 and now the monograph Grammatik der altgeorgischen               Sprache
(Hamburg, 1994). My own Georgian: A Learner's Grammar (Routledge,
 1995b) is now available as a self-tutor for English-speaking readers.
     Standing at the intersection of Europe and Asia and occupying an
 important strategic position in the Transcaucasus, Georgia has been
regarded as an attractive prize by more powerful peoples since time
 immemorial. Græco-Roman, Persian, Arabic, Turkish and, latterly, Russian
 influences have all left their traces on the language, especially in respect
of the lexicon. The Academy Dictionary (KEGL) states the provenance of
many foreign lexemes, and in 1964 M. C'abashvili published a dictionary of
8                          GEORGI AN GRAMMARforeign words. The standard reference for Georgian-Iranian linguistic
contacts is the 1966 monograph by Mzia Andronik'ashvili. For Armeno-
Kartvelian contacts see Vogt (1938 & 1988).","[24, 25, 26, 27]"
"3.2.7 Indefinite (gan+u+sa+zgv+r+el+ob+it-i) Adjectives

where the identity is quite unknown), and -ga+c(a), used (more often
without the bracketed -a) for specific indefinites. Adding them to romel-i
we produce romel-i-me 'any (at all)' vs romel-i-ga+c(a) 'some'. The
latter may only be treated as an indivisible whole, which produces the

i-ga+c(a) (e.g. romel-i-ga+c(a)/ra-ga+c(a) ambav-i 'some business').
    The same unchanging pattern is also normal for the non-specific
indefinite, though the Genitive and Instrumental permit an old alternative,

"3.6. Particles    (na+c'il+ak'-eb-i)3.6.1 Interrogative Particles
Though OldGEORGIANformed 'Yes-No' questions by means of the clitic
particles -a and -me, the modern literary language does not (cf. 5.1.13.1),
though some mountain-dialects still employ -a.
    Leading questions expecting the answer 'yes' contain xom, those
expecting the answer 'no' contain xom ar/ver (cf. 5.1.13.4).
    An element of surprise is introduced into a question by means of either
of the particles gana or nu+tu (cf. 5.1.13.5).
    We have seen the particle -ga used with interrogative pronouns to
lend them the nuance of 'pray, on earth' (cf. 3.5.3). Less restrictedly such a
nuance can be provided by such particles as gana,                      nu+tu,

for Transitive Verbs (for a synthetic Perfect and a brief description of
some West GEORGI AN alternative Evidential see 4.11.1 and 4.11.2
respectively). Object-agreement is by means of the elements: 1st person
singular = -v-a+r (N.B. with a prefixai copy of the element v- standing
before the versioniser), 2nd person singular = - x - a + r , 3rd person
singular/plural = either -a or -s depending on verb-type, 1st person plural
= -v-a+r-t (N.B. with a prefixai copy of the element v- standing before
the versioniser), 2nd person plural = -x-a+r-t; in other words it is
esšentially the Prešent Indicative of the copula which is used to mark the
direct object in the Perfect. The paradigms prešented below are for a
changing subject (viz. Dative nominal) with constant 3rd person (singular or
plural) direct object.","[278, 279, 280]"
"1.9 Principles of CitationAll words are divided into constituent morphemes. Morpheme-boundaries
are indicated either by the hyphen or a plus-sign, the latter (+) being used
either when the identity of each morpheme is not important to the
particular phenomenon being explained (and thus they are not individually
glossed in those instances where morpheme-analyses are provided) or when
it is suspected that a morpheme-boudary is present but the precise analysis
might be unclear. For example, we could gloss each component of the Past
Participle 'baked' thus:
     ga-mo-m-cxv-ar-i
     Preverb-Preverb-Past.Participle.Prefix-bake-Past.Participle.Suffix-
                                                              Agreement.Marker
but it would normally be important only to know that this word is a verbal
adjective meaning 'baked', and it would therefore usually be presented
simply as:
     ga+mo+m+cxv+ar-i
     baked-AGR
     'baked'
     To illustrate the second case let us take the verbal noun (Masdar) of
the copula, q'+op+n-a, where the Masdar-formant is the final -a.
16                            GEORGI AN GRAMMARComparing this non-finite form with the finite v-i-q'av-i 'I was' vs i-q'+o
<= earlier i-q'v-a 'X was', we see that the root is -q'((a)v)- (with v -
marking 1st person subject, (-)i- an old passive marker 6 , -i an Indicative
exponent for the Aorist tense, and -a/+o the indicator of a 3rd person
singular subject). Readers will see that I have glossed the old passive
marker with such (Series 11 ) forms of the copula as the Subjective Version
vowel, even though, rather arbitrarily, I have glossed what in origin was
the same i-vowel in the Future Sub-Series forms of the copula, which
derive from an old passive of another root meaning 'do, make' (namely
-k(m)n-), as the Passive marker. What then in the Masdar are the
components - o p - and - n - ? An equals-sign (=) is used either where the
script would itself employ a hyphen or to indicate reduplication. A
question-mark applied to a whole word raises doubts as the
acceptability/existence of that word; when applied to an agreement-affix
within a verb, it questions either the presence of that (zero-)affix or
uncertainty as to the implied referent.
    The provenance of some examples is stated, but mostly no such source
is quoted. A large number of citations are taken from the illustrative
material in KEGL; most of the rest have been noted by me over the years
from my general reading of, and/or listening to, Georgian; occasionally
simple sentences were made up by myself.
    Readers cannot fail to notice the imbalance in the length of the
chapters, with Chapter 4 on verbal morphology representing more than all
the other chapters put together. This is a natural consequence of the fact
that the chief difficulty (and, to the linguist, greatest attraction) of
Georgian resides in the wonderful complexity of the verbal system. I have
endeavoured to give too much rather than too little information on the
various conjugational patterns (to such an extent that I suspect some may
accuse me of unnecessary spoon-feeding). However, as the verb is the
essence of this language, I felt it was important that readers new to the
language should be able to turn up immediately any particular 'screeve' (=
tense-, mood- or aspect-paradigm) and see how any individual sub-class of
verb conjugates therein. I have also tried to give as much guidance as I
could to help readers see and understand the many highways and byways
traversed by individual verb-roots.","[34, 35]"
"5.2.2.1.5 Concession
Esšentially there are two conjunctions that mark concession: tu+mc(a)
'although' is found with non-SUBJunctive verbs, whilst tu+nd(+a(+c)) 'even
if' is principally used in association with the Prešent SUBJunctive for
prešent concessions, with the Aorist SUBJunctive for future concessions, or
with the Pluperfect Indicative for past concessions. The latter conjunction
is analysable as tu 'if', the modal particle u+nd+a 'it is necessary', and -c
'even', which element occurs on a number of subordinating conjunctions and
pronouns to distinguish them from their interrogative variants—sometimes
this clitic attaches to some other word within the clause rather than to the
concessive conjunction itself. In addition to tu, the former conjunction
contains the now obsolete formant -mc(a), whose role in OldGEORGIANwas
to lend a šense of non-factuality to the indicative with which it was
construed. Examples:      tu+nd xvale      mo-m-k'1-a-n,                      a r m-e-nagvl-eb-a

The simplest construction has ro+gor+c 'as' (cf. interrogative ro+gor?
'how?') introducing an indicative verb, the order of the two clauses being
irrelevant, e.g.   ro+gor+c        šen      g-e-p'rian-eb-a,            i+s + e
   as           you(DAT) you-IOV-appeal-TS-it           so
   mo-(Ø-)i-kec-i
   PREV-(you-)PASS-act-AOR.INDIC(=I MPER)
   'Act as the fancy takes you'    If the correlative is i + m + gvar + ad(-ve) 'in (just) that way', the
manner-clause will be introduced by ro+gor+ada+c, whilst a parallel
correlative-conjunctional coupling is i+m+nair+ad(-ve)...ra+nair+ada+c.
    If the above reprešent factual clauses of manner, the situation is
somewhat different in the case of hypothetical manner-clauses. The
subordinating conjunction is t+i+tk+o(+s) 'as if, as though', which derives
from tu i+tkv+a 'if it was/is said' or tu i+tkv+a+s 'if it transpires that it
is said'. The conjunction permits three constructions: (a) the verb will be in
that tense of the indicative which is appropriate to the demands of the
main verb; (b) the Prešent SUBJunctive may replace the Prešent Indicative if
59Ø                         GEORGIANGRAMMARthe main verb is non-past, whilst the III rd SUBJunctive may replace an
Aorist Indicative or Perfect that would have occurred in the putative
original direct speech, regardless of the tense of the main verb; (c) given
the prešence of a form of the verb 'say' within the conjunction, the clause
may reflect the reporting of original speech (or thought) by coupling the
speech-particle -o with the words originally spoken (or thought), e.g.      sax-is       ga+mo+me+t'q'v+el+eb+a i+s+e+t-i

5.2.2.1.7.1'when'
The basic temporal conjunctions are the fully interchangeable
r(+)o+de+sa+c and r(+)o+ca 'when' (cf. interrogative r( + )o + di+s?
'when?'), either of which will stand at the start of a clause containing an
indicative verb, e.g.      r(+)o+de+sa+c / / r(+)o+ca mo-x-val,                šen-i

      'When you come, bring your sister too'    Examples may also be found of causal ra+k'i and manner ro+gor
appearing in contexts where it seems more appropriate to translate them
as 'when'.
    The general subordinator rom is frequently used, especially in speech,
in a temporal šense, so that the subordinate clause in the above-example
could be replaced by:      šen / /     a+k    rom      mo-x-val...
      you(NOM)    here   when

suitable insertions to protect the clitic rom from claušinitial position. The
non-finite method of expressing the basic temporal notion is to use the
Masdar of the subordinate verb. It stands in the Genitive case, being
dependent upon dro-s, Dative of the noun dro 'time', e.g.   tv+it+m+pr+in+av-ši š s v l - i s                  dro-s    gul-is

   churn-TS-MASD(NOM) me-IOV-begin-TS-it          generally
   'When entering a plane I start to feel nauseous as a rule'   The Masdar plus dro-s may be fused to produce the Dative of the
Genitive base within the Masdar alone (i.e. š s v l - i s a - s ) .5.2.2.1.7.2 'as soon as'
Two finite reprešentations exist. The first places the words ro+gor+c k'i
'as soon as' at the start of the indicative subordinate clause, which may
either precede or follow the main clause, e.g.   ro+gor+c k'i       šen-i     c'er+il-i     mo-m-i-va,
   as.soon.as        you-AGR letter-NOM PREV-me-OV-come(.it.FuT)

   it-DAT PREV-I -(it-)SV-read-TS(FuT)
   'As soon as your letter reaches me, I shall read it'    The second strategy is based on the formation of alternative questions
and places the words tu ara 'or not' immediately after the subordinate
verb; a peculiarity of this strategy is that the subordinate clause must
precede the main clause, so that the first clause in the last example may be
recast to give either:   šen-i c'er+il-i mo-m-i-va tu ara,...or mo-m-i-va tu ara šen-i c'er+il-i,...","[607, 608, 609, 610]"

Notes
1   Historically the -s was the Genitive singular added to a stem ending in -e. For the
    analysis see Mač'avariani (1959).
2 It has been suggested that this is an importation from Old Armenian, where the ending
    is normal for the Instrumental case of i-stem nouns (e.g. ban-iw 'by/with/through
    word'). This hypothesis perhaps accounts for the šense in which the ending -iv is
    used inGEORGIAN,but it fails to explain why this borrowing should have capitalised on
    the Instrumental desinence only for Armenian i-stem nouns when no such borrowing
    seems to have taken place from the more common Armenian a-stems (e.g. a m - a w
    'by/with/through year'; Yisous ašakert-aw-k h -n iwr-ov-k h gnac h Jesus(NOM)
    disciple-INST-Pl-the      his-INST-Pl    he.departed 'Jesus left with his disciples'), unless
    k'vla+v 'again' is to be so analysed. The only alternative explanation I have seen
    supposes that originally the particle -ve was suffixed to the citation-form of the
    adjective or participle and that in time the word-final e-vowel was lost by apocope.
    This proposal, however, as far as I can see, completely fails to account for the
    meaning of the forms in -iv.
3 Or Dative perhaps?
4 vidre (cf. 5.2.3.1) may also be used with the object of comparison, which in such
    instances stands in the same case as the entity with which it is being compared (e.g.
    i+s upro did-i-a vidre e+s that(NOM) more big-NOM-is than this(NOM 'that one is
    bigger than this one').
5 Discussing a parallel phenomenon in Mingrelian, namely net'e go-m-o-k'et-eb-ap-
    u-ni =GEORGIANnet'avi (rom (- -ni)) ga-m-a-k'et-eb-in-a 'Would that X
    made/were to make me do it', K'iziria (1982:89) comments: 'the trivalent verb has
    become bivalent; as subject is the noun placed in the Dative.' In other words, he
    views the pronominal element - m - , which correlates with a notionally Dative 1st
    person singular pronoun outside the verb (here unexpressed), as the subject. I find
    this a rather extreme analysis in view of the fact that surely we may simply add to the
    Mingrelian g o r o n t - k (and I suspect g m e r t - m a to theGEORGIAN)'God-ERG'
    (historically speaking at least this is the Ergative case in Mingrelian) to make explicit
    the true subject that is left understood in most cases, cf. the followingGEORGIAN
    phrase with this subject actually prešent alongside the Aorist Indicative gmert-ma
    î?0-)g-i-švel-a, which expresses the wish 'May God help you!'. Tuite (1991.150)
    accepts K'iziria's view in his discussion of theGEORGIANphenomenon.
6 Cf. the use of -u plus an indicative verb in Svan today. See also 5.2.2.1.1.
7 An exact parallel exists in Mingrelian g-a-lu-ap-u-k =GEORGIANg-e-vl-eb-i, from
    which the Adverbial case of the Past Participle is g o - l u - a p - i r - o , as in the
    expression skan-i go-lu-ap-ir-o čkim-i dud-i 'may my head be your encircled',
     so that skan-i go-lu-ap-ir-o is used much likeGEORGIANg-e-na+cva(l-e), cf. also
    kә-go-r-lu-ap-e-d-a-k! =GEORGIANäe-mo-g-vl-eb-od-e! 'may I encircle you!'.
     In Abkhaz we s-wә-k'ә+x+әa-x[a]-aa+yt' 'may I encircle you(MASC)' or 5-wә-
    k'ә+x+sa-w+p' 'I am your(MASC) encircler = darling', cf. yә-wә-x-sa s-a-g[a]-
    ša+yt' 'let what may befall you(MASC) carry me off!': if one were to address these
     expressions to a woman, the - w ә - would be replaced by - b ә - . N.B. the underlined
     sibilant reprešents retroflex articulation.
8 Aorist i-jr-a, Perfect Jr-ul-a. Cf. mic'+is-jvr+a 'earthquake'.
9 Presumably the suffix is analysable as the posposition -tan, here though governing the
     Genitive, plus the adjective-formant -a; when used nominally the Genitive is in -a-s.
 10 As a general term of address we have the Vocative, as in: s'en, m a v a n - o ,

4      Verbal Morphology4.0.   IntroductionThe very esšence of theGEORGIANlanguage (as well as the source of much
of its difficulty) resides in its verbal system. And it is advisable to spend a
while on an overview of the system before entering into detailed
description.
    The following are the morphemes that may occur in aGEORGIANverb-

Suffix(es). The Prešent, Past and Aorist Subjunctive of the copula are
incorporated by some verbs into part of their conjugational paradigms. In
OldGEORGIANa further suffixal morpheme that is no longer attested in the
literary language was an element whose prešence was triggered by some
plural Nominative nouns, e.g.     c'ign-i        da-v-(Ø-)c'er-e

     I wrote books'1which latter today would be: c'ign-eb-i (/c'ign-n-i) da-v-(Ø-)c'er-e.
    Detailed information is offered later in the chapter for each of the
above-morphological elements. In the meantime, preverbs can be thought
of as somewhat akin to the adverbial components of English phrasal verbs.
Version-vowels indicate certain types of relationships holding between the
verbal arguments (e.g. between subject and direct or indirect object, or
118                        GEORGI AN GRAMMARbetween direct and indirect objects); traditionally there exist Neutral,
Subjective, Objective and locative Versions. Thematic Suffix is the term I
have chošen to describe the set of morphemes according to which the
formation of the tense-mood-aspect paradigms of the language's Transitive
and Intransitive verbs is sub-divided; other terms that have been used for
these morphemes are Prešent(-Future) Stem Formants or Series Markers.
A few examples of the above-verbal morphemes in concrete and regular
verbal complexes may help to give an idea of their behaviour, even if a full
understanding will only be possible once each individual morpheme has
been described in the appropriate section below—the sub-script number

an external direct object, no doubt by virtue of loss of the relevant but

      'the lad will strike his sister in the back a heavy blow with a snowball'    The verb just illustrated for the meaning 'hit' is in the process of
becoming a regular transitive, such that today one often hears in place of
the prescriptively correct construction given above the non-standard
deda-m šv+il-i (Ø-)(s2 -)cem-a; another Transitive verb with missing

the locative Version, I have glossed the - a - as the Neutral Version (see

a regular direct object). Ivane Imnaishvili (1971.331-335) lists 23 verbs
which in OldGEORGIANwere Transitives with just external subject and
indirect object but which today have been realigned as normal Transitives,
taking external subject and direct object in the modern language3. The

Peremptory commands can be toned down somewhat by adding ra with a
rise-fall pitch at the end of the sentence (e.g. c'a-Iv-Jvid-e-t, ra! 'let's
go, can't we?', e+s ga-(Ø-)m-i-k'et-e, ra! 'do this for me, please').
Georgian has no simple word for 'please'; the last example could be
rephrased with g - t x o v 'I beg/urge/request you' replacing ra —
alternatively, one could turn the sentence round to give g-txov e+s ga-
(Ø-)m-i-k'et-o 'I request you to do (= Aorist Subjunctive) this for me', or
again g-txov, e+s ga-(Ø-)m-i-k'et-e (ra)r where the Imperative is
used (with or without the softening ra).
    A more or less synonymous effect is achieved by placing mo-di, the
singular imperative of the verb 'come', before the command (with or without
ra at the end).
    Use of the cardinal ert-i '1' also has a parallel effect—it is often
combined with aba, e.g.     aba, ert + i,                   ča-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-q'ar-o-t               a+k

innovated in this regard. It is also found in past unreal conditions, where

direct object is indicated in the verb in exactly the same way as the
subject is indicated in the equivalent Aorist Indicative, which means that
the Weak or Strong endings along with any root-extension found in the
Aorist, whether throughout the paradigm or just when the subject is 1st or
2nd person, will be repeated in the Pluperfect with the difference that it is
now the direct object which motivates them.","[285, 286, 287]"

Depending on whether one wants the neutral, potential or prohibitional
pronouns one has a respective choice of ara-vin, vera-vin, nura-vin
for 'no-one', or again for 'no longer anybody' the choice is a-gara-vin,
ve-gara-vin, nu-gara-vin; the declensions follow that of vin? above.
The parallel choices for 'nothing'/'no longer anything' are ara-per-i/a-
gara-per-i, vera-per-i/ve-gara-per-i, nura-per-i/nu-gara-per-i
respectively; these decline like any syncopating consonant-final noun.
    An older alternative to ara-per-i is ara-ra, or just ara. An example
of this last would be: ara-s (= ara-per-s (ar)) v-i-t'q'v-i 'I shall say
nothing'. The longer of the alternatives is today usually only found when
its constituent parts are split by the verb, as in the traditional start to
fairy-tales (viz. i-q'+o da ara i-q'+o ra 'there was and there was
nothing' = 'once upon a time'). For the potential equivalent vera in the
phrase vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you won't be able to achieve
anything' cf. mag kad+il-it vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i-t, bič'-eb-o
'with that impudence you won't manage to achieve anything, lads'.","[99, 100]"
"     Given two sets of pronominal agreement-affixes, the subject usually
selects its marker from Set A, whilst the object is shewn by a Set B affix
(e.g. m-nax-av-s meB-see-TS-XA(FUT) 'X will see me'), whereas in part of
a transitive verb's set of paradigms and for certain verbs throughout their
conjugation the subject selects its marker from Set B, whilst the object is
indicated by a Set A affix (e.g. ar m-i-nax-av-s not I B - O V - s e e -
TS(PERF)-XA        'I have not seen X', m-q'+av-x-a + r 4          IB-have-youA-
be(PRES) 'I have you').
     Any individual verb-form will be classifiable as (i) Transitive, (ii)
Intransitive (passive), (iii) Medial, (iv) Indirect, (v) Stative. Whilst a single
root does not normally manifest all five types, let us take the root e'er in
an attempt to illustrate each of them: (i) (Ø-Ø-)c'er (you-X-)write(PRES)
'you write X/them', (ii) i-c'er-eb-a PASS-write-TS-X(PRES)           'X is being
written', (iii) (Ø-)c'er-a-ob which is quoted from Holisky (1981.75) as the
slang expression 'you screw around', (iv) (?)m-e-c'er-eb-a          I-IOV-write-
 TS-X(PRES)'\ feel like writing' 5 , (v) s-c'er-i-a ?-write-STAT(PRES)-X 'X is
(sc. in a state of having been) written'.
     GEORGIAN'scomplement of tense-mood-aspect forms (generically
referred to by Kartvelologists as 'screeves' from theGEORGIANword
mc'k'riv-i 'row') are divided into three 'Series': Series I consists of Prešent
Indicative, Prešent Subjunctive, Imperfect Indicative [together constituting
the Prešent Sub-Series], Future Indicative, Future Subjunctive and
Conditional [collectively constituting the Future Sub-Series]; Series 11
incorporates just the Aorist Indicative (or Simple Past) and Aorist
Subjunctive (called by some 'Optative'); Series 111 contains the Perfect
(which screeve, when used without a negative, often implies that the
speaker is drawing an inference from some prešent evidence that some
event must have preceded or that he is reporting hearsay about an

witnessed such that he can vouchsafe for the truth of what he is saying),
Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive. This three-way division is not merely
fundamental for the tripartite distinction in the morpho-syntactic marking
of subject and object of Transitive (and Medial) verbs discussed
morphologically in 4.7.1.3 and 4.7.3 as well as syntactically in 5.1.7, but also
facilitates the description of the morphological patterning of the various
sub-types of verb.
     Roots are normally associated with one or more preverbs, which
typically appear(s) in aspectually perfective forms 6 (which in gross terms
may be taken to mean screeves other than those of the Prešent Sub-Series,
though there are exceptions predominantly with preverbless Series 11
formations). A problem is that, apart from with verbs of motion, it is almost
always impossible to predict which preverb(s) a given root will select. Also
the lexical meaning to be assigned to a particular verb-form is often a
function not just of the root but of the union of root with this or that
preverb (some other concomitant changes, such as to the Thematic Suffix
or Version vowel, may also occur). Examples: out of the basic root c'er we
can produce such Future Indicatives as: (i) da-(Ø-)c'er-s PREV-(Y-)write-
X'X will write (Y)', (ii) mi-(Ø-)s-c'er-s PREV-(Y-)Z-write.to-X 'X will write

     'we shall put a cover over the wine storage-jar'     The formation of screeves for Transitive and Intransitive Verbs will be
given according to a division based on Thematic Suffix—roots which do not
accommodate a Thematic Suffix are called Root Verbs, though one might
equally style them Athematic.
     Sometimes a change of preverb does not alter the lexical meaning of
the verbal complex but introduces a special nuance. For example, the
preverb da- often substitutes for a root's usual preverb if some notion of
plurality is involved, most simply seen in the following example where a
singular subject is replaced with a plural, viz. k'vercx-i ga-laq'-d-a
egg-NOM PREV-addled-become-it(AOR)            'the egg became addled' vs
k'vercx-eb-i da-laq'-d-a egg-Pl-NOM                 PREV-addled-become-
3rd.PER(AOR)       'the eggs became addled'. In the following case the
replacement-preverb reduces the effect of the verbal action, viz. k'ar-i
ga-v-(Ø-)a-g-e door-NOM PREV-I-(it-)NV-open-INDIC(AOR) 'I opened
the door' vs k'ar-i še-v-(Ø-)a-g-e 'I opened the door ajar', cf. kal-i
ga-suk-d-a woman-NOM PREV-fat-becomeshe(AOR)             'the woman grew
fat' vs kal-i mo-suk-d-a 'the woman put on a little weight'.
     Suppletion exists. It may be determined by (a) screeve (Sub-)Series (e.g.
v-(Ø-)amb-ob I-(X-)say-TS(PRES) 'I say X' vs v-(Ø-)i-t'q'v-i I-(X-)SV-
say-lNDlC(FUT) 'I shall say X' vs v-(Ø-)tkv-i I-(X-)say-INDIC(AOR) 'I
said X'—sometimes alteration to a verb's classification combines with
suppletion as in the case of what is formally the Intransitive Prešent ra-s
(Ø-Ø-)Svr-eb-i? what?-DAT (you-it-)do-TS-INDIC(PRES) 'what are you
doing?' becoming the Transitive Future ra-s (Ø-Ø-)i-zam? what?-DAT
(you-it-)SV-do(FUT) 'what will you do?' or again the Transitive Aorist ra
(Ø-Ø-)ken-i? what(NOM) (you-it-)do-INDIC(AOR) 'what did you do?';
alternatively we can illustrate a shift from Indirect verb in the Prešent
Sub-Series for

     'the/a child is lying on the bed'   With bivalent Intransitive Verbs sometimes it is the Nominative
argument which corresponds to the subject, e.g.     q'vela    a+ma-s        (Ø-)e-c'ina+ag+m+deg-eb-a

     'everyone opposes this'
126                         GEORGIANGRAMMARwhereas at other times it is the Dative nominal which fulfils this function,

     woman-DAT child-NOM along (she-)IOV-have-TS-it(FUT)
     'the woman will have her child with her'     Occasionally one and the same verb-form permits both interpretations
(e.g. the Nominative is the subject of the first verb in this proverb:      zgva-s    (Ø-)e-rid-eb-od-a,               cvar-ma

      you(DAT) not(PROH) (PREV-)you-I OV-be.shy-TS-X(PRES)
      'don't you be shy (sc. of doing X)!')   Some formally intransitive (deponent) verb-forms are construed with
what appears to be a direct object, e.g.      e + s xe            k ' a r g vašl-eb-s          (?0-)i-jl-ev-a

would stand in the Nominative, whilst the indirect object remains Dative,
prescriptive grammar (to which speech does not always conform—see 5.1.7)
requires that such nominals remain Dative, e.g.      mo+nadir+e     mgvdel-s      mo-(?Ø-Ø-)u-q'v-a

monovalent by virtue of being construed with only a single Nominative
argument. This state of affairs characterises Series I and II, but, if the
verb possesses forms for the Series 111 screeves, these often revert to

   'the bird will flop/flopped/has flopped down on the ground'    Sometimes not all screeves exist for a given type of verb. In these
cases either a gap exists or the missing screeve is filled by a variant-form
of the root in question; alternatively, suppletion might occur. These
together with all the other morphological particularities and peculiarities of
theGEORGIANverbal system will be described later in this chapter.

relative to the stem, are now prešented. The affixes are pronominal in
function and are prešent whether or not the NPs, possibly consisting of just
a personal pronoun, with which they correlate appear within the clause as
external arguments. As an absolute minimum aGEORGIANverb-form must
contain at least one Set A affix in addition to the root:Affixai Agreement-Set A

in all screeves, whilst for Transitives and Medišis they mark the subject
for the various screeves of Series I and 11 —what happens in Series 111 for
Transitives and Medišis and with Indirect verbs in general will be
described later. l e t us take as model of an Intransitive verb the passive
stem -i-k'vl-eb- 'be killed' (consisting of the Subjective Version vowel in
its role as passive-marker followed by the root followed by a Thematic
Suffix) and illustrate subject-marking in the Prešent, Future and Aorist

      'I am being killed'       'I shall be killed'            'I was killed'    We see that with no preverb, as in the Prešent, the subject pronominal
affix of the 1st person stands first in the complex, preceding any pre-
radical vowel that may be used, whereas it follows any preverb(s) that may
be prešent. If the subject is plural, then the pluralising exponent -t is
added at the end of the complex, to give:

actually selected depends on the screeve and/or type of verb involved, as
will be explained as each type is described in detail below. The 3rd person
equivalents to the above are:   Prešent                     Future                     Aorist

can demonstrate subject-marking for a Transitive verb—the prešence of
the zero-morph from the Set B affixal set in the following verb-forms points

    let us now turn to the Set B affixes. First we note that to mark 3rd
person direct objects the zero-allomorph alone is used and that
prescriptively the plurality of such 3rd person direct objects is never
indicated, though in practice one does come across such examples as:      e+s           (ma-t)      (Ø-)a-xasiat-eb-t

   'X kills them'            'X will kill them'          'X killed them'    The affixes are seen to occupy the same positions relative to the other
exponents as do the affixes of Set A. Where both the 3rd person singular
subject-suffix and the direct object pluraliser are prešent, they occur in
this order (as in the sequence -a-t here from the Aorist). But where the
expected sequence is -s-t (as in earlier forms ofGEORGIANwe would here
have had (mo-)g-k'l-av-s-t 'X kills (will kill) you PI.'), the Set A subject-
suffix is deleted. As to the number of the 3rd person object, it is left to
the context to determine whether forms like (Ø-)k'l-av-s etc.. are
construed with a singular or plural direct object.
    We now have to consider how this picture is complicated when
combinations other than with 3rd person singular subject occur. Assuming
that a subject-prefix would indeed precede a direct object-prefix, the
sequence of v - g - anticipated for a meaning like 'I kill you' is never
realised because the subject-affix is dropped before the object-marker
-g-, viz.
132                          GEORGI AN GRAMMAR   g-k'l-av                    mo-g-k'l-av                   mo-g-k'al-i
   'I kill you'                'I shall kill you'           'I killed you'      I f we now add to such forms the pluraliser -t to give:      g-k'1-av-t              mo-g-k'1-av-t                  mo-g-k'al-i-twe produce forms that are polysemous, for they could be interpreted as: (i)
'I kill/shall kill/killed you Pl.', where the pluraliser is part of the 2nd person
exponent from Set B, or (ii) 'we kill/shall kill/killed you', where the
pluraliser is part of the 1st person exponent from Set A, or (iii) 'we
kill/shall kill/killed you Pl"", where an expected final sequence of -t-t has
been simplified by loss of one of the dentals but it is unclear which one—in
the Prešent and Future the forms here may have as a fourth reading the
one given earlier, namely 'X kills/will kill you Pl', which arises out of the
loss of - s - from Set A when followed by -t.
     There are no problems with combinations of 2nd person subject and 1st
person direct object, e.g.      (Ø-)m-k'l-av           mo-(Ø-)m-k'l-av               mo-(Ø-)m-k'al-i
      'you kill me'          'you will kill me'            'you killed me'

      'you Pl. kill me'      'you Pl. will kill me'   'you      Pl- killed me'
      (Ø-)gv-k'l-av          mo-(Ø-)gv-k'l-av               mo-(Ø-)gv-k'al-i
      'you kill us'          'you will kill us'            'you killed us'
      (Ø-)gv-k'l-av-t        mo-(Ø-)gv-k'l-av-t             mo-(Ø-)gv-k'al-i-t
      'you Pl kill us'       'you Pl will kill us'         'you Pl killed us'    Similarly there are no problems with the combinations of 3rd person
plural subject with (i) 1st person singular or plural and (ii) 2nd person
singular direct objects, e.g.      m-k'1-av-en             mo-m-k'l-av-en               mo-m-k'1-es
      'they kill me'          'they will kill me'          'they killed me'
      gv-k'1-av-en            mo-gv-k'1-av-en              mo-gv-k'1-es
      'they kill us'          'they will kill us'          'they killed us'
      g-k'1-av-en             mo-g-k'1-av-en               mo-g-k'1-es
      'they kill you'         'they will kill you'         'they killed you'    However, since the pluraliser -t may not stand after any of the 3rd
person plural allomorphs -(a/e)n/es/nen of Set A, the forms in the last
                                 VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                               133row quoted are ambiguous as the 2nd person direct object could be either
singular or plural.
    This brings us to the marking of indirect objects. The Set B affixes are
again employed, except that now the alternative allomorphs for the 3rd
person come into play according to the rule prešented in 2.2.7, namely: the
base- (=historically oldest) morph h- assimilates to s- when immediately
followed by any of -c, -c', - j , -č, -č', - j , -t, -t', -d, being retained as
h - before -k, -k', -g, -q', - p ' 1 3 ; before other consonants or a vowel the
zero-allophone is used. However, if until around the 2nd World War the
allophones s-, h- were still possible between 1st person subject-marker v-
and the root-initial consonant (e.g. mi-v-s-c'er 'I shall write to X/them',
v-h-q'v-eb-i 'I follow X/them'), today this is in general no longer true, so
that these examples would now be rendered respectively as: mi-v-c'er,
v-q'v-eb-i. Examples are from the Future Indicative forms of the
Transitive verb 'write to' and of the Intransitive verb 'follow':  mo-(Ø-)g-c'er                   mo-(Ø-Ø14 -)m-c'er           mi 1 5 -(0-0-)s-

134                           GEORGI AN GRAMMAR     Again there is an ambiguity in such forms as mo-g-q'v-eb-i-t, as
between (i) 'I'll follow you Pl', (ii) 'we'll follow you', and (iii) 'we'll follow you
Pl'.
     We have not yet discussed the bracketed 3rd person pluraliser from
Set B or what happens with transitive verbs when both direct and indirect
object would require a non-zero pronominal prefix within the verbal
complex, a couplingGEORGIANseems to prefer to avoid. As regards the
pluraliser, prescriptive rules require that Transitive Verbs simply never
mark the plurality of a 3rd person indirect object, which is why all forms
given above for 'write to' with 3rd person indirect object were glossed as
'to X/them'. I have come across only two examples where the plurality of a
3rd person indirect object is marked with this -t on a transitive verb; the
first is from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo (29 March 1991, p.2):      xm-eb-i-c,            roml-eb-sa-c        asak'-i      ar
      voice-Pl-NOM-too which-Pl-DAT-REl         age-NOM      not

      'the voices too to which age does not give the means to express their

Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's lord of Rach'a. The verb is one of those which are
Transitive but lack a direct object, their second argument being the
indirect object, viz.      m+sm+en+el-eb-s       žriant'el-ma      da-(?Ø-Ø-)u-ar-a-t

      'a shudder ran through the audience'    However, if the verb is a bipersonal intransitive, it is indeed possible to
mark the plurality of the 3rd person indirect object as long as the subject
of the verb is 3rd person singular, so that 'X will follow them' could be
either mi-h-q'v-eb-a or mi-h-q'v-eb-a-t. An attested example of this
feature with this very root, though with a different preverb, comes from
the text of Ivane Imnaishvili's 1971 Historical Chrestomathy of the

     'From their own root only the Prešent Indicative (etc..) are formed for

pluraliser, a consideration of these examples reveals that it cannot simply
be the prešence vs abšence of the plural indirect object in the clause, or
whether the plural indirect object precedes or follows its verb.
    More will be said when describing the formation of Series 111 for
Transitive and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general about the use
with them of the two sets of pronominal affixes, but it is appropriate to
note at this point that, since with these forms the Dative nominal functions
as subject and the Nominative as direct object, the Set B affixes reprešent
the subject, whilst the Set A affixes correlate with the direct object. As
plural 3rd person human subjects impose their plurality on the verb, in
these instances the plurality of the Dative nominal will always be marked
on the verb by the suffixal -t if the Dative noun is human and if the direct
object is 3rd person (N.B. the plurality of the Nominative nominal is just
ignored as far as verbal agreement is concerned), e.g.     m+š+ob+el-s (Ø-)u-q'var-s                šv+il-i            /

      The parents love the children'   This suggests that during the course of its historyGEORGIANhas shifted
subject-status from the Nominative to the Dative nominal for these verb-
forms. There are two interesting illustrations in KEGl of what is
manifestly a bivalent Intransitive verb, namely 'be born to'. The first
comes from the great 19th century writer Ilia t'avč'avadze:      si+t'q'v+a-n-i      gul-ši        m-e-bad-eb-i-an
      word-Pl-NOM         heart-in     me-I OV-be.born-TS-PRES.INDIC-Pl
      'Words/Speeches are born to me in the heart (= are born in my heart)'where the old plural of the (non-human) subject imposes its plurality on the
verb 16 . This contrasts with the following from Ch'avch'avadze's equally
great contemporary, Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli:      šv+il-eb-i          (Ø-)e-bad-eb-a-t
      child-Pl-NOM        (3rd.PER-)I OV-be.born-TS-Srd.PER-Pl

being indicated by the Set A singular suffix -a-, whilst the Dative indirect
object has its plurality shewn by -t, just as if this were an Indirect verb,
which it palpably is not 17 . Thus, one cannot take the mere prešence of this
pluraliser with a 3rd person entity as an indicator that the 3rd person
entity in question is viewed as the subject of the verb-form.
    As already stated, this pluraliser for a 3rd person Dative nominal
should, according to prescriptivists, be found only when the Nominative
nominal is itself 3rd person. Once again, however, one does come across
instances where the pluraliser appears with 1st or 2nd person Nominative
nominals. Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's autobiography furnishes the examples:   da-v-(Ø-)u-brun-eb-i-v-a+r-t                          sopel-ši     da

    How, then, doesGEORGIANavoid having two non-zero Set B affixes
within a single verbal complex, as one would expect in the translation of
clauses like 'they give you to me'?GEORGIANavoids the difficulty by
paraphrasing one of the nominals as a 3rd person NP, which, of course,
takes a zero as its coreferential affix in the verb. The phrase in question
consists of the appropriate case of the noun tav-i 'head; self' preceded by
the possessive adjective of the paraphrased pronoun. This periphrasis then
substitutes for the direct object pronoun, e.g.   šen-i    m+s'+ob+l-eb-i  šen-s  tav-s                 (Ø-)m-a-jl-ev-en

      'our parents give us to you'    This periphrasis will even be used where the indirect object is 3rd
person, asGEORGIANseems to have a preference for interpreting a 1st or
2nd person pronominal prefix on a trivalent verb as the marker of indirect
rather than direct objecthood, e.g.      čem-i     m+š+ob+l-eb-i čem-s tav-s             ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s

      (3rd.PER-her-)lV-entrust-TS-they(PRES)
      'my parents are entrusting me/handing me over to the teacher'    However, where the context makes it clear which nominal is the direct
and which the indirect object, this rule may be ignored—for instance, if I
am the child, it is unlikely that my parents would be entrusting the teacher
to me, and so one might hear in place of the above čem-i m+š+ob+1-eb-i
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en, even if prescriptively this
sequence should be interpreted as though the verb were to be analysed
(Ø-)m-a-bar-eb-en with the šense 'they are entrusting X/them to me'.
KEGl provides an example of the verb 'introduce X to Y' with the

1    Introduction
1.0 Genealogy and GeographyGeorgian belongs to the South Caucasian (Kartvelian) language-family,
whose other three members are Svan, Laz and Mingrelian, the last two of
which are sometimes treated, especially by linguists in Georgia, as dialects
of the so-called Zan language. The schema (after Deeters 1930) in Table 1
shews the generally accepted path of historical divergences.
    For discussions of the diachronic and inter-family relationships see
Schmidt (1962; 1978), Ts'ereteli (1966), who examines the ideas of
Gamq'relidze and Mač'avariani (1966), and Vogt (1967). Despite many
attempts, no-one has yet succeeded in proving a genetic relationship
between Kartvelian and any other language or language-family even within
the area of the Caucasus, let alone further afield, for example the
Georgian-Basque hypothesis, of which accessible critiques are available
from Vogt (1955 or 1988) and Rayfield (1990). The four languages are
together spoken over a relatively small, compact area, which in the main is
centred on the Republic of Georgia, from 1921 to the break-up of the
Soviet Union one of its three Transcaucasian republics. Exceptions to this
are: (a) Laz, which, apart from a negligible number of speakers within
Georgia, is confined to Lazistan, where an unknown, though perhaps
sizeable number of speakers inhabit the coastal strip running roughly from
Rize eastwards to the (Soviet/)Georgian frontier in modern-day Turkey; (b)
Fereydanian, the Georgian dialect spoken in Iran by the descendants of
those transported from East Georgia in the 17th century by Shah Abbas; (c)
Imerxevian, the Georgian dialect spoken by ethnic Georgians in those
provinces that have been part of Turkey since the 16th century; (d)
Ingiloan, the Georgian dialect spoken in the Zakatala region of
Azerbaydzhan; (e) Qizlar-Mozdokian, an obsolescent Georgian dialect
spoken in the north-central Caucasus by descendants of those who sought
safety there from East Georgia in the 18th century. Small émigré-
communities of Georgians live in Germany, France and America, whilst a
considerable number of Georgian Jews are to be found in Israel.
2                        GEORGI AN GRAMMAR             Table 1: Family-tree of the Kartvelian Languages
    Within Georgia itself, as indicated on the accompanying map, Svan is
spoken in the high mountain-valleys of the rivers Enguri and Cxenis-c'q'ali
in the north-western region of Svaneti(a), east of Abxazia. Mingrelian is
located in Mingrelia, the lowland area of West Georgia that is bounded by
Abxazia, Svaneti(a), Imereti and Guria. As for Georgian, its many and
diverse dialects are: Ač'aran, Gurian, Imeretian in the west, Lečxumian,
Rač'an in the north-west, Mtiulur-Gudamaq'rulian, Moxevian in the north,
Xevsurian, Pshavian and Tush in the north-east, K'ax(et)ian in the east,
Mesxian, Dzhavaxian in the south(-west), and Kartlian in the centre. The
literary dialect, which is described below, is based on the speech of the
province of Kartli, in which the capital Tbilisi is situated.
     It might be appropriate to observe at this point that, although the
Georgians on the whole profess (Orthodox) Christianity, as a result of
Turkish influence the natives of Ač'ara adopted Islam. The interplay of
religion and ethnicity is also relevant with regard to the S.W. province of
Mesxeti. On 15th November 1944 144,000 (according to the figure most
regularly quoted) residents of the area and adherents of Islam were exiled
to Soviet Central Asia, a fate that was suffered by a number of Soviet
peoples around the time of World War 11 (Crimean Tatars, Volga Germans,
and from the N. Caucasus Balkars, Karachays, Chechens and Ingush).
Though acknowledged under Khrushchëv to have been guilty of no crimes
(such as treason), these Mesx(et)ians have not yet secured permission to
return to their homeland, principally because of opposition from the
government of Georgia, and many had to be hurriedly evacuated from
Uzbekistan following the inter-ethnic conflict that flared up in the
Ferghana Valley in 1989. These people are usually referred to as
«Mesx(et)ian Turks», and it has been suggested that they were removed
from the border-area because of their pro-Turkish sympathies in advance
                              INTRODUCTION                                 3of a possible Soviet incursion into Turkey. The precise ethnic allegiance
of the possibly 300,000 who wish to return to Georgia is a matter of
dispute: are they turkified Georgians or ethnic Turks, descended from
those who settled in an area regarded by Georgians as primaeval Georgian
land when it became the border between Georgia and Ottoman Turkey?
The arguments put forward in support of Georgia's refusal to allow their
resettlement are that: (a) the region has been repopulated, (b) there is no
room elsewhere in Georgia either, (c) Christian Georgians have always
been, and still are being, threatened by adherents of Islam*, so that to
accept the influx of so many muslims, especially along their border with
Turkey, would be to invite trouble. The most that has been offered is
resettlement somewhere within Georgia of those who (a) vow allegiance to
Georgia, (b) know, or will learn, Georgian, (c) have, or will adopt, Georgian
surnames, and (d) convert to Christianity.","[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"
"    A subtle interplay between affixal marking and preverb sometimes
becomes relevant in such cases. In the non-Prešent Sub-Series the verb
'entrust' can take either mo- or mi-, the former when the verbal activity is
directed towards either 1st or 2nd person (or, more rarely, a 3rd person if
that 3rd person is in the vicinity of either speaker or addressee), whilst the
latter implies an action aimed away from speaker or addressee. This
means that, when prešented with a form like mimabareben, the listener
knows that the 1st person agreement-affix cannot be signalling an indirect
object, as motion towards 1st person would necessitate the preverb mo-.
Hence, this verb-form will be analysed as mi-m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en 'they
will entrust me to X/them', making the periphrasis unnecessary. On the
other hand, momabareben can only be analysed as mo-(Ø-)m-a-bar-
eb-en 'they will entrust X/them to me'.
    The esšentials of cross-referencing within the verb of upto three
external arguments have now been explained. More will be said at the
appropriate places about the specifics of Series 111 forms for Transitive
and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general. This section closes
with some further examples of agreement-patterns for different types of
Transitive and Intransitive verb-forms in Series I and II—try to spot just
the relevant affixes, ignoring other features like preverb, Version-vowel,
or Thematic Suffix that may be prešent:

commentators as Prešent(-Future) Stem Formants or Series Markers, are
elements, consisting in all cases but one of the structure VC, which attach
directly to a root (or root + Causative-marker, or root + passive/inceptive
marker -d-) for all screeves in Series I. Since the Perfect of Transitives
is formed on the Prešent stem, most Transitives keep their Thematic Suffix
also in the Perfect. The verbal noun (Masdar) and participles for most
verbs also incorporate the relevant Thematic Suffix (in some cases in a
reduced guise), and, since Series III for monopersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Past Participle whilst that for bipersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Masdar, Thematic Suffixes are widely attested in Series
III for Intransitive (including Indirect and Stative) verbs. Two of the
Thematic Suffixes (with exceptions) even occur in Series 11. For these
reasons I judge the alternative names given above for these formants too
restrictive.
    The Thematic Suffixes in use today with Transitive Verbs are: -eb,
-ob, -av, -am, -ev, -en, and -i. Those in this list are widely used; in
addition one can point to: (a) -em, found in parts of the paradigm for the
root 'give' (viz. Future mi-(0-0-)s-c-em PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)3rd.PER-
give-TS(FUT) 'you will give X/them to Y/them' vs the equivalent Aorist mi-
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)e-c-i PREV-(you-3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)IOV-give-AORJNDIC                 'you
gave X/them to Y/them'); (b) -op, found with the root for 'divide' (viz. ga-
(Ø-Ø-)q'-op PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)divide-TS(FUT) 'you will divide X/them'
vs Aorist ga-(Ø-Ø-)q'av-i 'you divided X/them')—this suffix also turns up
in part of the paradigm of the copula (e.g. the past participle q'-op-il-i
'having been, ex-' and the masdar q'-op-n-a 'being').
    Whilst theGEORGIANmasdar does not normally distinguish active
(transitive) from passive (intransitive), there are a number of roots which
do possess their own passive/intransitive masdars. In these masdars one
finds the element -om occupying the slot normally taken by the Thematic
Suffix (i.e. between root and masdar-exponent -a). Consider the following:
(a-)(Ø-)dg-eb-i 'you (will) stand up' => vs a-dg-om-a 'standing up' (cf.
dg-om-a 'standing'), (mo-)(Ø-)k'vd-eb-i 'you (will) die' => (mo-)k'vd-om-
a 'dying'18, (Ø-)xt'-i 'you jump' => xt'-om-a 'jumping', (ga-)t'q'd-eb-a 'X
(will) break(s)' => (ga-)t'q'd-om-a 'breaking (intrans.)' vs (ga-)(0-0-)t'ex
'you (will) break X/them' => (ga-)t'ex-a 'breaking (trans.)', (mo-)(0-0-)a-
xd-en 'you (will) effect X/them' => (mo-)xd-en-a 'effecting' vs (mo-)xd-
eb-a 'it (will) happen(s)' => (mo-)xd-om-a 'happening'. With this last it is
interesting to compare the verb-form ( g a - ) ( 0 - 0 - 0 - ) x d - i (N.B. the
144                          GEORGIANGRAMMARdifferent Thematic Suffix as well as the structural analysis) (Prev-)(you-
3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)strip-TS 'you (will) remove article(s) of clothing X from
Y/them', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-a 'undressing', whereas we have
the intransitive form (ga-)(Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you (will) become X; you (will)
grow thin', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-om-a. However, for the
former meaning of this verb-form there exists the transitive (ga-)(0-
0 - ) x d - i 'you (will) render X/them Y' (e.g. u+en+o-s     ga-g-xd-i-s
speechless-DAT PREV-you-render-X(FUT) 'X will render you speechless').
Yet it would seem that in this instance the Masdar in -om is also used
transitively—KEGl quotes this example for C'avč'avadze:      še+i+jl+eb+a st'umar-i jm-ad                mi-(Ø-)i-tvis-o-s

      'It's possible for a man to accept a guest as a brother, but, as for
      making him (his) master, he will die and (still) not deign to do this'     In the case of šr-om-a the word is viewed today more as an abstract-
noun 'work(ing)' than as the Masdar of (Ø-Ø-)š'vr-eb-i 'you do X'.
     There are a few verbs that employ in places the seeming Thematic
Suffix -ol (e.g. kar-i kr-i-s 'the wind blows' => kr-ol-a 'blowing' and cf.
the Future kar-i i-kr-ol-eb-s 'the wind will blow'; g-q'+av-s 'you have
animate X/them' => q'-ol-a 'having (something animate)' and cf. the Future
g-e-q'-ol-eb-a 'you will have animate X/them'; (Ø-Ø-)i-svr-i 'you hurl
X/them' => sr-ol-a 'throwing' and cf. the Future (Ø-Ø-)i-sr-ol-eb 'you
will hurl X/them'; (da-)(Ø-)c'v-eb-i 'you (will) lie down' => da-c'-ol-a
'lying down' (cf. c'-ol-a 'lying')).
     Another suffix that might be regarded as (at least akin to) a Thematic
Suffix is -il, but this too today has more of the force of an abstract-noun
formant—it is particularly common with Stative verbs, and sometimes it
combines with the prefix si- (e.g. tav-i g-t'k'iv-a head-NOM you-pain-it
'your head aches' => t'k'iv-il-i '(being in) pain', (Ø-)dum-x-a+r you-
be.silent-you-be 'you are silent' => dum-il-i '(being in) silence', (Ø-)k'vd-
eb-i 'you die' => si-k'vd-il-i 'death', (Ø-)i-rb-en 'you will run' => either
si-rb-il-i or rb-en-a 1 9 , g-ši-a 'you are hungry' => ši-mš-il-i <= *si-ms-
il-i, for the bilabial nasal cf. mš-ier-i 'hungry' and (Ø-Ø-)a-mš-ev 'you
                             VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                            145make X/them hungry'). In a few verbs the suffix -il seems to correlate
with -in in other parts of the paradigm (e.g. j(-)il-i 'sleep' vs g-j(-)in-
av-s 'you are asleep', korc'(-)il-i 'wedding-feast' vs da-korc'(-)in-d-
nen 'they got married' and gan-korc'(-)in-d-nen 'they got divorced').
     The Thematic Suffix -i is clearly the exception in terms of its
structure, as well as being the one which is not carried over into the
Perfect. However, at first glance it may seem that this latter statement is
not correct (cf. ga-g-zrd-i-s PREV-you-rear-TS-X          'X will rear you',
which gives the Perfect ga-(Ø-)u-zrd-i-x-a+r 'X apparently (has) reared
you', where we still have an i-vowel immediately after the root. However,
this is no longer the Thematic Suffix but a Perfect-exponent, as we see if
we take any Transitive Perfect formed from roots coupled either with no
Thematic Suffix or any Thematic Suffix other than -av or -am in Series I
(e.g. for the Root Verb (da-)(0-0-)c'er 'you (will) write X/them' we have
the Perfect da-g-i-c'er-i-a 'you apparently wrote/have written X/them',
whilst for (ga-)(0-0-)a-k'et-eb 'you (will) do/make X/them' we have the
Perfect ga-g-i-k'et-eb-i-a 'you apparently (have) made X/them').
     Of the Thematic Suffixes listed above -eb, or, more restrictedly, -ob
and -ev are also found in Series I screeves as part of the morphology of
Intransitive verbs—as indeed is the bilabial element of -am and the labio­
dental for some verbs in -av.
     As to the original function of the Thematic Suffixes, the best
explanation so far advanced is that of Aronson (1979). To anticipate what
is made explicit in Chapter 5, a comparison of the syntax of Transitive and
Intransitive verbal classes for Series I screeves reveals that we are
dealing with a Nominative-Accusative configuration (the Nominative case
marks the subject of both Transitive and Intransitive Verbs, whilst the
direct object is marked differently, viz. by the Dative case). In Series II,
however, we have an Ergative-Absolutive alignment (transitive subjects
standing in the Ergative case, whilst intransitive subjects and direct objects
stand in the Nominative(-Absolutive)). The Dative case is, of course, also
used to mark the indirect object with the majority of finite verb-forms, and
the at first glance surprising fact that the Dative also marks the direct
object for Transitive Verbs in Series I screeves could be straightforwardly
explained, if in origin the relevant argument functioned as an indirect
object of what at the time would have been a bivalent intransitive verb-
form. Aronson illustrated an instance in OldGEORGIANwhere what today
would be regarded as a simple Dative direct object was evidently
interpreted as an indirect object thereby occasioning the Set B agreement-
prefix s- in the verb-form (namely:
146                         GEORGI AN GRAMMAR      s-cv-i-d-es                            i+gi-n-i       bč'e-ta
      3rd.PER-defend-3rd.PER-I MPERF-they    that-Pl-NOM    gate-Pl(DAT)
      'they were defending the gates')    Taking, as commentators generally do, Series 11 with its ergative-
alignment to be basic in the language, Aronson suggested that what today
are clearly independently existing Series I transitive screeves with their
own restructured tense, and aspectual (sc. imperfective vs perfective)
oppositions (not to mention the active-passive dichotomy) were in origin all
derived intransitive, imperfective forms produced from the fundamental,
ergatively aligned Series 11 base-forms by an anti-passive transformation,
whose morphological markers were none other than today's Thematic
Suffixes. Series I direct objects were, thus, in origin indirect objects and
were naturally marked by the Dative; this case has simply continued to
mark the relevant entity, now reinterpreted as a direct object.
    A given root will normally be used for a given meaning always with the
same Thematic Suffix, even though it sometimes happens that dialects
employ for a given root a Thematic Suffix different from the one generally
in use, and Root Verbs are sometimes assigned a Thematic Suffix, often
-av (e.g. for (Ø-Ø-)t'ex 'you break X/them' one may meet (Ø-Ø-)t'ex-
av). However, we have already given one example where the suffix -av
was replaced by -eb when an indirect object governed by the locative
Versional vowel a- was associated with the root in question. Two parallel
examples would be (še-)(0-0-)k'er-av (PREV-)(you-3rd.PER-)sew-TS 'you

Thematic Suffix -ev, which is usually a normal bivalent Transitive,
incorporating what would thus be judged to be the Neutral Version a-vowel
coupled with a Dative indirect object without any change to the verb-

148                        GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.3 Preverbs       (zmn+is+c'in+eb+i)In origin the preverbs were independently standing adverbial elements
which indicated directionality and/or orientation (sc. movement towards or
away from the speaker). Comparison of a case like postposition -gan 'from'
vs preverb ga(n)- 'out of' reveals a clear bifurcation in the development of
one such hypothesised adverbial as it solidified in the former instance with
a noun and in the latter instance with a verb (cf. postposition -Si 'in(to)' and
preverb še- 'in(to)'). Further evidence for the original independent status
of these elements comes both from the frequent examples of so-called
tmesis in OldGEORGIANtexts and from the behaviour of some of the
preverbs in modern Svan.
    The original directional-orientational force of the preverbs is
preserved when they are combined with roots expressing motion. Starting
with the two preverbs of orientation, mi- and mo-, the prešent-day list of
preverbs is as follows:      Simplex                                       Complex

from either speaker or hearer (hence the translation 'go'), whereas m o -
indicates 'hither', which is orientation towards either speaker or hearer (or
towards a 3rd person who is in the vicinity of speaker or hearer—hence
'come'). In OldGEORGIANmo- was associated exclusively with the speaker,
so that, whereas today one can only say šen-tan mo-di-s 'X is coming to
your place', the equivalent in OldGEORGIANwould have been šen-tan mi-
di-s. Where a verbal root implies movement, if that root has as its
preverb mi- when the movement is towards a 3rd person indirect object,
then the preverbal slot will be taken by mo- for movement towards 1st or
2nd person (e.g. mi-v-(Ø-Ø-)e-c-i 'I gave X/them to Y/them' vs m o -
(Ø-)g-e-c-i = OldGEORGIANmi-(Ø-)g-e-c-i 'I gave X/them to you' vs
mo-(Ø-Ø-)gv-e-c-i 'you gave X/them to us'; mi-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)mart-e 'you
addressed yourself to X/them' vs mo-(?Ø-)g-mart-es 'they addressed
themselves to you/you(PD' vs mo-(Ø-?Ø-)m-mart-e-t 'you(Pl) addressed
yourselves to me'2Ø).
    Association of the two orientational preverbs in the order given
indicates movement in both directions (i.e. 'to and fro', 'back and forth').
An example would be mi-mo-di-s tav+is otax-ši 'X is pacing back and
forth/up and down in his/her own room'. Such a coupling can often be
alternatively expressed by a special reduplication consisting of m i - plus
relevant components of the verbal complex upto (usually) the end of the
root followed by (and hyphenated if written) the same sequence but with
mo- plus all appropriate inflexional material after the root (e.g. mi-mo-i-
xed-av-s = mi-i-xed=mo-i-xed-av-s 'X will look this way and that' 21 ;
and mi-mo-(Ø-)a-c , q'd-eb-a = mi-(Ø-)a-c , q'd=mo-(Ø-)a-c'q'd-eb-a
'X will crash into Y this way and that'). However, to judge by the relatively
few examples quoted in KEGl, in the case of the basic verb of motion
reduplication with these two orientational preverbs may imply movement
over a greater distance than is achievable in a single room, e.g.

      'men (and) women are coming and going to (sc. and from) the vineyard'    This type of reduplication is not of course limited to the two preverbs
illustrated so far—for example, the normal preverb for the root - c ' o n -
'weigh' is a-, but to indicate a very serious consideration of a matter we
can combine this with da-, whose original directional force was the
opposite to that of a-, to give:      a-(Ø-)c'on=da-(Ø-)c'on-es
      PREV-(3rd.PER-)weigh-PREV-(3rd.PER-)weigh-they(AOR)
      'they weighed X/them up and down'    Coupling of m o - with itself would be illogical, as one cannot have
hither-orientation of 'hither', but for the other preverbs abšence of m i -
implies thither-orientation, whilst the addition of mo- as second component
lends the basic directionality a hither-orientation, which explains the
translations appended to the examples listed above.
    The original force of da- was 'down', and this is still prešent in such
verbs as da-(?0-)e-c-a or da-vard-a 'X fell down'. However, with the
verb of motion the meaning 'go down' is rather restricted, KEGl giving just
the one example for the subject 'temperature', viz.      t'emp'erat'ura     gam-it     zog-jer       nul-a-mde       da-di-s
      temperature(NOM) night-INST some-times null-ADV-upto        PREV-fall-X
      'sometimes by night the temperature falls/sinks to zero'    With this šense the verb has the regular paradigm for the verb of
motion (viz. 3rd person Future da-va 2 3 , Aorist da-vid-a, Perfect d a - s -
ul-a). However, da-di-s more usually has the šense of 'go on a regular
basis', which contrasts with mi-di-s 'X goes/is going NOW' and m i - m o -
di-s 'X is going to and fro NOW' (e.g. sk'ola-ši da-di-s velosip'ed-it 'X

   'boats (regularly) journey between Poti and Odessa')    For this šense the verb resorts to (transitive but preverbless!)
suppletive forms outside the Prešent Sub-Series (viz. 3rd person Future

Pluperfect (ma-s) e-vl-o—see 4.10).
    For the coupling da-mo- Shanidze (1976.71) quotes an OldGEORGIAN
example from Acts (possibly 9:39) where the šense is 'down hither', viz.   da-mo-s-di-od-es                                nak'adul-n-i

   'streams of tears were pouring down them'but in ModernGEORGIANthe coupling is found with only one verb root, and
even here it is restricted to the relevant Past and Privative Participles (viz.
da-mo-k'id-eb-ul-i 'dependent', da-mo-u-k'id-eb-el-i 'independent')
and their derivatives (viz. da-mo-k'id-eb-ul-eba 'dependence', da-mo-
u-k'id-eb-1-oba 'independence').
    For the šense of 'X is going down' ča-di-s is used (e.g lipt'-it a-di-
x-a+r tu ča-di-x-a+r? 'Are you going up or down with the lift?'), in
addition to retaining its original force of 'down into' (e.g. magaro-ši ča-v-
di-v-a+r 'I'm going down (into) the mine'), which is explained by the
preverb's etymology (c'a- <= š-ta- <= *še-da-). The intermediate stage in
the development is retained in such forms as š+ta+gon+eb+a 'inspiration',
whereas the Masdar of this cognate verb today is ča-gon-eb-a 'putting a
thought in someone's mind'. This preverb is also used with the verb of
motion to signify 'alight from a car/train/bus' (e.g. ča-v-di-v-a+r, ga-
(Ø-)m-a-t'ar-e! 'I'm getting off, let me pass/off/through!') or 'go
somewhere (covering a large distance, as between two towns)'.               If
orientation is towards speaker or addressee in these cases, the complex
da-mo- will naturally be used (e.g. dge-s vin ča-mo-di-s mosk'ov-
i+dan? 'Who is coming from Moscow today?').
    In addition to being used for the direction 'into from outside', the
preverb še- is used in contexts of signifying 'up onto' (e.g. da-jd-a 'X sat
down' with da- vs še-jd-a cxen-ze/xe-ze 'X sat on the horse/tree' with
še-).
152                        GEORGIANGRAMMAR    On p. 17 of S. Mak'alatia's History and Ethnography of Mingrelia we find
in virtually identical contexts the Past Participle meaning 'preserved', and
yet in one case še- alone is used, whilst in the other we have še-mo-, viz.     mcire      cn+ob-eb-i-a       jvel berjn+ul m+c'er+l+oba-ši

     'few reports are preserved in Ancient Greek literature'vs berjn+ul c'q'aro-eb-ši mcire cn+ob-eb-i-a še+mo+nax+ul-i 'in

    No example was offered above for the preverbs c ' a - / c ' a - m o - , c'a-
basically indicating 'forward' (cf. c'in 'in front, before, ahead'), in the
Prešent of the verb of motion. This is because such couplings are not
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. However, elsewhere in the paradigm
these preverbs do come into play, and the question arises as to how one
differentiates between, say, the Futures c'a-va and rni-va, both signifying
'X will go'. The answer is that c'a- emphasises the departure and
journeying, whilst mi- implies reaching the destination (e.g. bič'-i c'a-va
sk'ola-ši 'the lad will go to school' vs bič'-i mi-va buxar-tan 'the lad
will go upto the stove'). The same interplay is observed with the verb for
'take'—in the Prešent Sub-Series only mi- is possible, e.g.      eg c'ign-i       sad      mi-g-a-kv-s?
      that book-NOM where? PREV-you-lV-take-it
      'Where are you taking that book?'whereas elsewhere the same nuances as just described attach to the
preverbs mi- and c'a-, e.g.      malamo          tan    c'a-(Ø-Ø-)-t'an-e! (= c'a-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e!)

      'the teacher took the book to the class'
      The difference between mo- and c'a-mo- is that the former indicates

'away' towards or with speaker or hearer (e.g. mo-(Ø-)di a+k! 'come
here!' vs c'a-mo-(Ø-)i, ert+ad c'a-vid-e-t! 'Come on away/along, let's

   'Hold on, we'll come along too')    From their original role as markers of directionality/orientation the
preverbs took on the function of marking perfective aspect with the result
that today for the bulk of verbs in the Transitive and Intransitive classes
the relevant preverb will usually be prešent in screeves other than those
of the Prešent Sub-Series. The addition of the appropriate (and usually
unpredictable) preverb to the Prešent Indicative of most Transitive or
Intransitive verbs produces the Future Indicative (e.g. (Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s
'X does/makes Y/them' => ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s 'X will do/make Y/them').
 In OldGEORGIANthere was no independent Future Indicative screeve, the
Prešent or Aorist Subjunctive as appropriate (sc. according to aspect)
making up the deficiency. The association of root with preverb can then
come to play a lexical role, for by altering the preverb from ga- to še-
with the root -k'et- we produce a verb-form with the lexical meaning
'repair' (e.g. ro+di+s še-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-en a+m t'elevizor-s? 'When
will they repair this television?'), the preverbless Prešent (Sub-Series) forms
being ambiguous out of context for the meanings 'do/make' vs 'repair'.
Another example would be the verb 'kill' which normally takes the preverb
m o - (e.g. bič'-ma baq'aq'-i mo-(Ø-)k'l-a 'the lad killed the frog'), but if
the killing is with a knife (typically of an animal slaughtered in ritualistic
sacrifice or for preparation as food), then the preverb da- takes over, e.g.   dia+saxl+is-ma katam-i              da-(Ø-)k'l-a               da
   housewife-ERG        chicken-NOM PREV-(it-)kill-she(AOR) and

   (it-)us-lV-feed-she(AOR)
   'the housewife killed the chicken (sc. by slitting its throat) and fed it to
   us'    These couplings do not exhaust the possibilities for the root 'kill', and
the range of couplings well illustrates the way the inter-dependencies of
root and preverb (as well as Version) complicate the lexical structure of

The reason for the choice of preverb in most of the examples in the
previous paragraph is, I think, opaque—synonymous roots can be found
which, despite their parallel semantics, take different preverbs (e.g. da-s-
cin-eb = ga-kird-av 'you will mock X'). Sometimes, the change can be
explained in terms of the original directional force of the preverb and the
basic lexical meaning of the root is little altered. The normal preverb for
-ngr- 'ruin' is da-, e.g.      revolucia-m       da-(Ø-)a-ngr-i-a             sa+zizg+ar-i

adjective in full agreement with its head to preposed adjectives manifesting
the partial agreement (sc. for consonant-final adjectives) characterising the
literary language today, as illustrated above.     Georgian literature up to
the early 20th century reveals slight variant-patterns for consonant-final
attributive adjectives, which are now described.         A Dative noun may
produce agreement in its epithet (e.g. maġal-s kaHeb-)s(a)). This same
form of the adjective may be attested alongside a noun in the Adverbial
(e.g. maġal-s kaHeb-)ad(a)), and it is perhaps to be regarded as more
normal than the bare stem when a possessive adjective (see 3.2.5) is
construed with Dative and Adverbial nouns (e.g. čem(-s) da-s my(-AGR)
sister-DAT 'to my sister'; šen(-s) megobr-ad your(-AGR) friend-ADV 'as
your friend'). A Genitive head equally may impose its desinence on its
attribute (e.g. maġl-is kaHeb-)is(a)). This same form of the adjective
was also possible alongside a noun in the Instrumental (e.g. maġl-is kal-
(eb-)it(a)). Two further innovations in agreement-patterning may be
noted: according to Shanidze (1973:84), the first is for the bare stem of the
adjective (e.g. maġal) alone to be used for all cases of the head-noun other
than the Nominative and Vocative. This development, of course, brings

where, as we have seen, there is no agreement today at all. The second,
styled as 'vulgar' in The Norms of the Modern Georgian Literary
Language (1986:132, in Georgian), is for an adjective to keep throughout
its declension the same form that it manifests in agreement with Nominative
nouns (viz. maġal-i). This would produce an exact parallel with Georgian's
largest sister-language, Mingrelian, and, according to The Norms, this
option is indeed restricted to some Western dialects.
    Nouns indicating professions could be interpreted as virtual attributive
adjectives when used in conjunction with a person's surname. In these
circumstances a consonant-final attribute follows the following pattern for
the expression 'President Zhordania':   Case                     Singular
   NOMINATI VE              p'rezident'-i žordania
   VOCATIVE                 p'rezident'-o žordania-v

   INSTRUMENTAL             p'rezident' žordania-ti
   ADVERBIAL                p 'reziden t ' žordan ia -d(a)    This pattern clearly differs somewhat from those already presented,
and it is the one that is followed by expressions of the type kalak-i
tbilis-i 'the city (of) Tbilisi'. In some older types of phrase, where the
profession or, in reference to sovereigns, their number follows a Christian
name, the word designating the profession (or number) declines, whilst the
Christian name appears in its root-form only (e.g. 'Gaioz the Rector' in the
Nominative and Ergative cases would be gaioz rekt'or-i vs g a i o z
rekt'or-ma, 'George I' would similarly be giorgi p'irvel-i vs giorgi
p'irvel-ma; equally 'Queen Tamar' would be tamar me+p+e vs tamar
me+p + e-m). A parallel to this is what happens when Christian and
surnames are given together: the Christian name stays in its root-form,
whilst the surname declines. Under Russian influence the patronymic
system was introduced (with je for 'son' and asul-i for 'daughter'); if used,
the patronymic too will not decline before the surname (e.g. the Nominative
and Ergative of 'Zviad (son of K'onst'ant'ine) Gamsaxurdia' would be zviad
(k'onst'ant'ine-s je) gamsaxurdia vs zviad (k'onst'ant'ine-s je)
gamsaxurdia-m). In those rare instances when the reverse ordering is
followed, the following paradigm is observed (with gaps in the Instrumental
and Adverbial):

         t-i xarisx-eb-i)
There are two formations: the older synthetic pattern vs the newer
analytic.
    The analytic may apply without exception to any adjective in the
language. To produce the comparative grade the adverb u+pr+o 'more' is
placed before the positive form of the adjective, e.g.     'good'        k'arg-i        =>         'better'           u+pr+o k'arg-i
     'bad'         cud-i          =>         'worse'            u+pr+o cud-i
     'few'         cot'a          =>         'fewer'            u+pr+o cofa
     'many'        bevr-i         =>         'more'             u+pr+o bevr-i
     'beautiful'   lamaz-i        =>         'more beautiful'   u+pr+o lamaz-i
     'red'         c'itel-i       =>         'redder'           u+pr+o c'itel-i
     'strong'      magar-i        =>         'stronger'         u+pr+o magar-i
     'long'        grj+el-i       =>         'longer'           u+pr+o grj+el-i
     'sweet'        t'k'b+il-i    =>         'sweeter'          u+pr+o t'k'b+il-i
     'old'         jvel-i         =>         'older'            u+pr+o jvel-i
     'easy'        a+dv+il-i      =>         'easier'           u+pr+o a+dv+il-i
     'blind'       brma           =>         'blinder'          u+pr+o brma
     'sour'        mžave          =>         'sourer'           u+pr+o miave
     'ugly'         ušno          =>         'uglier'           u+pr+o ušno
     'deaf'        q'ru           =>         'deafer'           u+pr+o q'ru   The superlative grade can only be produced syntactically by placing
the word q'vela-ze 'than all' (lit. 'all-on') before either the positive or
comparative grade e.g.

   all-than          (more)      short    dress
   'the shortest dress'    The synthetic formation, which in meaning is rather neutral between
comparative and superlative, employs the circumfix u—es 1 -i. Sometimes
changes will occur to the root: syncope may take place, a suffix may
disappear, as does the final vowel of e-stem adjectives, whereas an
epenthetic -v- appears between root-final -a and the initial vowel of the
suffix. The analytic form for the first four adjectives in the above-list is
irregular. With that list compare the following:   'good'        k'arg-i         =>       'better'           u-k'et-es-i/u-

   'old'         jvel-i          =>       'older'            u-jvel-es-i
   'easy'        a+dv+il-i       =>       'easier'           u-a+dv+il-es-i
   'blind'       brma            =>       'blinder'          u-brma-v-es-i
   'sour'        miave           =>       'sourer'           u-mžav-es-i
   'ugly'        ušno            =>       'uglier'           u-ušno-es-i
   'deaf'        q'ru            =>       'deafer'           u-q'ru-es-i    In all such cases a clear superlative may be produced in the same way
as for the analytical pattern by placing q'vela-ze (possibly immediately
followed by u+pr+o) before either the form in u—es-i or, of course, the
simple positive grade. A special alternative for the meaning 'best' is sa-u-
k'et-es-o/sa-u-m+job-es-o; for 'most' there is u-met'-es-i.

himself a Mingrelian, uses the same analytic method employed by
Mingrelian for non-perfective future statements, namely: the 3rd person
singular of the Future Indicative of the copula (i-kn-eb-a) remains as an
invariant auxiliary in combination with the Prešent Subjunctive of the
lexical verb, which of course contains the relevant agreement-affixes.
Topuria's use of this combination of features suggests that he expected the
force of it to be readily understood by hisGEORGIANreaders. And so, we
should perhaps indicate the coupling in the expectation that it may be
characteristic of some types of non-literaryGEORGIAN.Taking the root

"1.6 DemographyAccording to the 1989 Soviet census there were 3,983,115 «Georgians» in
the USSR, of whom 3,787,393 resided in Georgia, where they comprised
70.1%of the republic's population. However, this total is misleading. In the
1926 census 242,990 citizens declared Mingrelian nationality, and 13,218
Svan nationality. Sometime thereafter, probably around 1930, it seems to
have been decided that these peoples were to be reclassified as
«Georgians», with the result that these minor nationalities simply
disappeared from subsequent censuses. Although in 1989 individuals again
had the right to describe themselves as belonging to the nationality they,
rather than officialdom, deemed appropriate, very few chose (for whatever
reason) to deviate from the post-1926 orthodoxy. One consequence of this
10                        GEORGI AN GRAMMARis that there are no accurate figures for the Svan, Mingrelian and Laz
populations of Georgia, though 40,000 plus is usually quoted for Svans, and
up to one million for Mingrelians. More serious for the linguist is the
absence of data on the strength of native-speaker knowledge of all four
Kartvelian languages within Georgia. During the Soviet period all Svans as
well as the vast majority of Mingrelians and Georgians (proper) have been
educated through the medium of Georgian. The status of Georgian as the
local literary lingua franca together with the facts that (a) Georgian,
Mingrelian, Laz and Svan clearly derive from a common source, and (b)
their speakers generally share a long Christian tradition within the
Georgian Orthodox Church appears to be the main argument in defence of
viewing these peoples as one «Georgian» race. The origin of this confused
thinking is perhaps to be sought in the Georgian language itself. A
Georgian calls himself kart-v-el-i        (cf. sa-kart-v-el-o 'Georgia'),
whereas anything non-human but Georgian is kart-ul-i. The Georgian
expression for 'Kartvelian languages' is kart-v-el-ur-i           en-eb-i.
Regrettably, the language lacks the equivalent epithet for humans (*kart-
v-el-el-i ), with the result that kart-v-el-i 'Georgian' remains the (as
yet!) only available description. Since in English both 'Kartvelian' and
'Georgian' exist, there is no reason to overload the latter with an illogical
ambiguity.      Any attempt to argue for the non-Georgian status of
Mingrelians and Svans regularly excites a ferocious response in Georgia
(for details see Hewitt 1995a). Could this be the result of an exaggerated
desire to present their nation as more numerous (and thus stronger) than it
actually is? How else does one explain the fact that even the few thousand
North Central Caucasian Bats (Ts'ova-Tush) people, who reside exclusively
in the K'ax(et)ian village of Zemo Alvani and whose mother-tongue is in no
way related to Georgian, are equally fiercely portrayed as «Georgians» (cf.
 Itonishvili 1990)? For a recent etymology of the ethnonym-root kart-v-,
which derives it from the more familiar ethnonym 'Parthian', see Shanidze
(1978).
     Though united as a great feudal power from the time of David IV
(nicknamed 'The Builder', 1089-1125) through the «Golden Age» under
 Queen Tamar (1184-1213) to the appearance of the Mongols in the second
 quarter of the 13th century, the concept of Georgia as a single socio­
political unit did not really exist again until the birth of the revivalist-
movement in the latter half of the 19th century, alluded to above. Thus,
 despite its long and distinguished literary tradition, one could argue that
 Georgia is quite a young nation. Despite frequent inter-regional feuding in
 the past the one thing that the Georgians have always had in common is
 their language, and a plausible case could be made for saying that their
                              INTRODUCTION                               11pride in, and loyalty towards, their language have contributed greatly in
helping to ensure the survival of the nation in the face of all the perils
thrown up by history. At the same time, though, such devotion can be
taken to extremes. The belief is widespread that the language suffered
repression from Russia in favour of Russian throughout the Soviet period
(1921-1991), whereas, in contradistinction to the treatment meted out to
Georgian through much of the period of Tsarist rule in the 19th century,
more objective observers would surely conclude that Georgian was given
the opportunity actually to flourish during those 70 Soviet years when it
benefited from enjoying the constitutional status as the state-language of
one of the USSR's constituent republics (Hewitt 1985, 1989a), with universal
publishing of both newspapers and books, radio- and television-
broadcasting, and the possibility of completing the educational process
from kindergarten through university in the mother-tongue. When in 1978
the first draft for the Brezhnevite constitution made no specific mention of
Georgian being the main republican language, demonstrations forced the
then 1st Secretary, Eduard Shevardnadze, to remedy the omission, as one
may see by consulting Article 75. However, not everyone in Georgia
speaks Georgian, even as a 2nd (or 3rd) language. Consider the 1989
census-data:              Table 3: 1989 Population of the Georgian SSR3                             Total                      Percentage

Azerbaydzhani, Abxazian and Ossetic) schools Georgian-language teaching

This screeve of the indicative mood (txr+ob+it-i k'ilo), which is used as
equivalent to English 'X VERBs' or 'X is VERBing' and sometimes 'X is going
to VERB', is formed by adding the appropriate agreement-affixes to a base
consisting of Version Vowel (which will be zero for some verbs in Neutral
Version) plus Root plus Thematic Suffix (sc. other than in the case of Root
Verbs). The 3rd person singular subject-marker is universally -s, which
changes to -en in the plural, except for verbs with Thematic Suffix -i,
which require 3rd person plural subjects to be marked by the allomorph
-an. Basic paradigms are set out according to the so-called 'subject-
conjugation', which means that the direct object is kept constant in the 3rd

"'Motion' (2nd/3rd person subject)
The root that serves as an honorific copula when preverbless, namely
-brjan-, when endowed with a preverb expressing direction becomes an
honorific for the basic verb of motion (e.g. mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t 'you
(will) come' => Aorist mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, Perfect mo-(Ø-)brjan-eb-
ul-x-a+r-t). It is particularly common in asking questions (e.g. sad mi-
(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t? 'where are you going?) and in issuing commands (e.g.
mi-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, g-txov-t 'After you, please' = 'Go thither, I beg
you'). When the preverb is da-, the meaning of the verb-form is 'sit down',
whilst with a- the meaning is 'stand up'.
496                         GEORGIANGRAMMAR'Speak' (2nd/3rd person subject)
The root -brjan- when used transitively (again without preverb) means
'speak' or 'issue an instruction'. Examples: ra-s (Ø-Ø-)brjan-eb-t? 'what
are you saying?', (Ø-Ø-)brjan-e, äen-i xmal-i da čem-i k'iser-il
literally 'Speak, your sword and my neck' = 'Say what you want, I am yours
to command', sardal-ma (Ø-Ø-)brjan-a še+t'+ev+a-ze gada-svl-a
'the general ordered the going over to the attack'. When endowed with the
Objective Version, we get (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-brjan-eb 'you (will) give X/them
command Y','Say to'
Regardless of subject the usual verb for 'say to' can give way for reasons
of politeness to mo-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xs+en-eb 'you (will) say X/them to

used as '(academic) talk, paper', with the Active Participle m o - m - x s + e n -

Notes
      Cf. c'ign-n-i da-(Ø-)c'er-n-a 'X wrote books', which in Modern GEORGI AN is da-
      (Ø-)c'er-a.
      This pronominal prefix should only coördinate with a Dative indirect object, and so
      should strictly not be prešent if the indirect object is reinterpreted as a direct object.
      For a discussion of this verb see Shanidze (1979.122).
      The relevant verbs (quoted in their OldGEORGIANforms) are: (ag-)a-gzn-eb 'you
      (will) stir up', a-gin-eb 'you (will) swear at', (ga-)a-gril-eb 'you (will) cool', a-
      i+jul-eb 'you (will) compel', (da-)a-k'vir+v-eb 'you (will) surprise', (mo-)a-(m)ši-
      eb 'you (will) make hungry', (da-)a-mjim-eb 'you (will) make heavy', a-mxil-eb 'you
      (will) bring X's bad actions to light', a-rcxu-en 'you (will) put to shame', (da-)a-
      rc'm+un-eb 'you (will) convince', (ag-)a-g-eb 'you (will) raise', (gan-)a-gwij-eb
      'you (will) awaken', (še-)a-urv-eb 'you (will) disturb', ( š ) a - š i n - e b 'you (will)
      frighten', (gan-)a-cin-eb 'you (will) make laugh', a-ct-un-eb 'you (will) lead into
      error', (gan-)a-cxr-ob 'you (will) give relief', (da-)a-)in-eb 'you (will) put to sleep',
      a-c'u-ev 'you (will) call upon X to do Y', a-č'en-eb 'you (will) thrust away', (če-)a-
      č'ir+v-eb 'you (will) upset', (gan-)a-xar-eb 'you (will) give joy to', (da-)a-jer-eb
      'you (will) convince'. For the verb 'curse' the 8-volume kartuli enis ganmart'ebiti
      leksik'oni 'Explanatory Dictionary of theGEORGIANlanguage' (KEGL) quotes an
      example with the reinterpreted second argument as direct object (viz. kmr-is
      sa+c'+ol-i š ( Ø - ) a - g i n - a husband-GEN bed-NOM         PREV-(it-)NV-curšshe(AOR)
      'she cursed [herj husband's bed'), but a letter printed in the organ of the Writers'
      union of 31 March 1989 (page 2) has the 'old' indirect object retained (viz. a+m kuč-
      is cq'oč-ma» ar še-(?Ø-Ø-)a-gin-a nodar-s                this street-GEN cock-ERG        not
      PREV-(?3rd.PER-him-)lV-curšhe(AOR)           Nodar-DAT     'the «cock> of this street
      declined to curse Nodar'). Similarly for the verb 'compel' the now defunct journal of
      the Paris-basedGEORGIANčmigrč-community gušagi 'šentinel' had an example in its
      first issue (April, 1984, page 25) shewing Dative for the entity compelled and
      Nominative for the act they were compelled to perform alongside an Aorist verb-form
      (viz. ..sa+idan (Ø-Ø-)a-i+jul-es gad-mo-xt'-om-a xalx-s               whence (itSrd.PER-)
      l V-force, on-th ey(A OR) PREV-PREV-burst thro ugh-TS-MASD(NOM) people-DA T
      '...whence they forced the people to burst through'), whereas one would have
      expected Nominative for the person compelled followed by a subordinate clause (in
      this case, sc. after a past-tense verb, with the Pluperfect of 'burst through').
      The Masdar is q'-ol-a = Mingrelian '-un-a/'w-en-a.

    Dictionary (KEGL), which is why I have prefaced it with a question-mark for this
    particular sense — the form may convey any of the meanings 'it is being written
    for/to/on me' without difficulty, though in these instances it is classified as a bivalent
    I ntransitive.
6   Always assuming that Georgian is correctly described as having such an aspectual
    system — for doubts see Rayfield (1994a).
7   For information on the pluraliser - q ' e found in some dialects see the relevant
    sections of Tuite (1991) or Tuite (1989).
8   The final i-vowel in these forms is a marker of the indicative mood.
9   Some might prefer suppletion to v-i-xoc-eb-i-t           when the underlying patient is
    plural.
10 The only screeves today retaining the voiceless back fricative, which was once the
    universal 2nd person subject indicator, are: the Present of the copula = x-a+r(-t)
    'you (you Pl..) are', and, for the verb of motion, which is here shewn with the preverb
    mo-, the Future Indicative = mo-x-val(-t) 'you (vou Pl.) will come', the Conditional =
    mo-x-vid-od-i(-t) 'you (you P1.) would (have) come', the Future Subjunctive ro(m)
    mo-x-vid-od-e(-t) 'if you (you(PU) were to come', the Aorist Indicative = m o - x -
    ved-i(-t) 'you (you Pl.) came', and the Aorist Subjunctive = ro(m) mo-x-vid-e(-t)
    'in order that you (you Pl.) may come'. ,
11. Changes to the root will be explained at the appropriate time.
12 The following examples come from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo          'Literary Georgia' (3rd
    Feb 1989 page 11 and 1st June 1990 page 2 respectively): ra (Ø-)a-dard-eb- t

    riled at the peace between Georgia and the Abxazian people...'.
13 This h- used also to be found before - b , and it sometimes still occurs in this context.
    Volume 8 of KEGL, for instance, gives the entry-form é a - h - b a r - d - e b - a PREV-
    3rd.PER-be.entrusted-PASS-TS-X(FUT)          X will be entrused to Y'. The Dictionary of
    Morphemes and Modal Elements, published in 1988, also quotes such forms as da-h-
    bzu-i-s 'X buzzes over Y', whereas KEGL volume III, published in 1953, cites this
    latter verb without the h - .
14 These two zero-morphs represent respectively 2nd person subject and 3rd person
    direct object. I arbitrarily assume throughout this work that the affixal ordering is
    subject-direct object-indirect object.
15 The switch in preverb is dealt with below (4.3).
16 In Old Georgian plurals in -n- always imposed their plurality on the verb.
17 There is a homonymous Indirect Verb usually used in conjunction with a negative to
    mean 'have' (e.g. ara+per-i ar m-e-bad-eb-a            nothing-NOM not I-I OV-have-TS-
     it(FUT) 'I shall have nothing', which in the Present I ndicative would be m - a - b a d - i -
    a), but in the present instance we are dealing with the dynamic bipersonal passive of
    the root -bad- 'give birth'.
18 Masdars are usually construed with the relevant preverb.
19 Both variant-masdars (abstract-nouns) are employed by KEGL in the explanation
    offered of the entry-form i-rb-en-s 'X will run', namely: si-rb-il-it i-vl-i-s, r b -
    en-it c'a-va=c'a-mo-va 'X will move about running, X will go and come away
    running'.
20 The presence of a 1st or 2nd person direct object with a root that is construed with
    mi- does not of course occasion any such substitution (e.g. gvino t'k'b+il-ad mi-
    m-a-jin-eb-s 'wine will sweetly lull me to sleep').
5Ø8                              GEORGI AN GRAMMAR21    The natural order in English is of course here to have hither- followed by thither-
      orientation.
22    For the Dative in this quote from Vazha Pshavela cf. 5.1.1.5 (g).
23    The 3rd person subject-affix for this verb-form (sc. with any preverb) is actually zero
      as a result of the historical accident which saw the disappearance of material from
      the original end of the word, which was in Old Georgian da-val-s , where -s was the
      subject-suffix.
24    Note the plural verb-form though the subject is inanimate in this example from KEGL
25    Quoted by the Dictionary of Morphemes as da-h-mger-i-s .
26    The 1953 edition is not accessible to me.
27
      Forms such as (a-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (gada-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (ga-)(0-0-0-)a-
      t'an, (mo-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an (for which see the final paragraph of 4.4.4) are basically
      Locative Versional forms, for which see also 4.4.4. Note also the difference in the
      formation of the Perfect for the Subjective vs Locative Versional forms of this root
      (e.g. a-g-i-t'an-i-a 'you (have) apparently endured X/them' vs a-g-i-t'an-eb-i-a
      'you (have) apparently gone up and reached').
28    Cf. the Indo-European so-called Dative of Interest seen in this Latin example from
      Livy: militanti in Hispania pater eimoritur 'while he was serving [sc. Historic Present]
      in Spain, his father died', though, unlike Georgian, Latin verbs agree only with the
      subject argument.
29
      This is the Georgian translation (Danelia and Tsanava, 1991.47) of the Mingrelian
      osur-i giti-o-bs-әn-d- ә il ndem-c from one of the texts originally published by
      Q'ipshidze (1914).
30    KEGL does not quote the Subjective Versional form of this verb for the allomorph
      with an r root-finally.
31    N.B. (Ø-)g-i-sm-en-t 'I am listening to you (sc. to what you have to say)' with
      Objective Version, which is the standard opening gambit (a) when answering the
      phone or (b) for a waiter coming to take a customer's order.
32    The use of this verb with 'head' as direct object in the colloquial sense of 'cause
      shame to' necessitates the absence of versioniser (e.g. b i č - m a ojax-sa-c tav-i
      mo-(0-)s-č'r-a da čven-s sopel-sa-c             'the lad brought shame both to the family
      and to our village').
33    Note how this passive idea is conveyed by an active verb with non-referential 3rd
      person plural subject.
34    In verbs of this type the 'prescriptive' periphrasis that would change a 1st or 2nd
      person direct object into the 3rd person phrase 'my/our/your head' in the presence
      of a 3rd person indirect object tends to be ignored.
35
      There is also (mi-)(0-0-)i-p , at , iz'-eb .
36    Two Modern Georgian versions shew here the root - p ' q ' r - 'turn, direct' with
      Locative Version outranking the Subjective because of the (actual or implied)
      presence of an appropriate indirect object (viz. zeca-d ag-(0-?0-)a-p'q'r-o tval-
      n-i vs ca-s rni-(0-0-)a-p'q'r-o tval-eb-i).
37    Seen also in an ancient participle a+dg+il-i, now nominalised as 'place'.
38    Prescriptive grammar suggests that when the direct object is plural the root becomes
      -xoc-, as in (Ø-Ø-)xoc-av 'you kill them'.
39     In a number of compounds such as this the noun jvar-i does not syncopate (cf.
      me+jvar+e 'wedding-witness'), but when used in isolation it does syncopate (cf. the
      Genitive jvr-is ).
40    The element -n(i) here is the Mingrelian equivalent of the Georgian subordinator
      rom. If we transpose the Mingrelian system completely here into Georgian, an
       imperfective Conditional will be achieved simply by putting the auxiliary into its
      Conditional form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-a), whilst an imperfective Future Subjunctive will
      result if the auxiliary is placed in its Future Subjunctive form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-e-s).
                                  VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                    5Ø941
     Cf. da-v-(0-)xoc-av 'I shall kill them'.
42   The preverb may be mo- under appropriate conditions.
43   Clearly the morphemic analysis of this verb-form is problematic: the Nominative case -
     marking of 'enemy' would suggest that the second zero-morph of the verb should
     carry the question-mark, but the fact that this Nominative nominal 'controls' the
     versioniser suggests that the first zero-morph is the one without an external noun.
44
     Under appropriate circumstances the preverb may change to mo-.
45
     Clearly the underlying form here is /ga-0-q'v-a/. Since the 3rd person singular of
     the copula in the Aorist has a similar underlying root-suffixal sequence, namely / i -
     q'v-a/, which in this book I write i-q'+o, for consistency I should perhaps also write
     ga-(0-)q'+o here.
46   At least this is the prescriptive rule, even if the occasional exception is found in
     texts.
47   Note this almost literal equivalent to the English method of giving dates, whereas the
     normal way today would be to say rva ianvar-s 8 January-DAT 'on the 8th
     January'.
48   In such combinations one of these labio-dentals may fail to be pronounced.
49
     Note that the radical labio-dental drops under the influence of this immediately
     following bilabial.
50   As explained in 5.2.2.1.7.4.3, a past temporal clause meaning 'before' is normally
     constructed with the Conditional (or Aorist). Is the presence here of the Pluperfect in
     the subordinate clause the result of the influence of the preceding Pluperfect or just
     a variant in the same way as English here allows both 'before you had VERBed' and
     'before you VERBed'?
51   Interestingly in the Mingrelian language, spoken in part of West Georgia, the
     Pluperfect of active voiced Transitive Verbs stands in the same relation to the
     Perfect as the Imperfect Indicative does to the Present Indicative, with the Objective
     Version generalised for marking the subject (e.g. do-m-(i-)č'ar(-u) = Georgian da-
     m-i-c'er-i-a 'I have written X/them' vs do-m-(i-)č'ar-u-d(-u)         = Georgian da-m-
     e-c'er-a 'I had written X/them').
52   Mingrelian has formalised this semantic distinction, at least as far as Series I
     screeves are concerned: i-č'ar-u 'X is being written' vs i-č'ar-e 'X can be written';
     m-a-č'ar-u 'X is being written for/on me' vs m-a-č'ar-e 'I can write X/them'.
53
     Interestingly Mingrelian uses the active voice (Transitive pattern) for both such
     verbs, viz. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rz-en-k vs (Ø-Ø-)i-rz-en-k
54   This particular paradigm is a common Present Indicative for a number of verbs
     distinguished outside the Present Sub-Series by different preverbs. Perhaps the
     forms presented here are most often used in the sense of 'I remain/stay', which
     implies the use of the preverb da-.
55   Examples in KEGL suggest that, if the indirect object is inanimate, it may be
     expressed by means of the Objective Version.
56   This is the root-form of the Perfect as quoted by KEGL. However, in V. Topuria and
     Iv. Gigineishvili's 'Orthographic Dictionary' of 1968 the root-form ga-g-i-jg-i-a is
     given.
57   Do not confuse this with (ga-)i-njr-ev-i 'you (will) move', the Intransitive form of
     (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-njr-ev = (ga-XØ-Ø-)jr-av 'you (will) set X/them in motion'.
58   The Imperfect equivalent of sa-k'itx-i i-s-m-i-s 'a question is being posed' is sa-
     k'itx-i i-s-m-od-a.
59   The meaning 'come forth to meet' would result from a change of preverb to mo-.
60    KEGL wrongly gives this form as the impossible mo-i-xvn-a.
61   Note the devoicing of the back fricative in the first two persons.
62    For this one verb Tschenkéli (1958.I.271) reports a variant in - e .
510                                  GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
63    One meets the occasional example (and not infrequently in the works of Vazha
      Pshavela) where, in place of the regular expansion in -od- plus Imperfect Indicative
      or Prešent Subjunctive endings, the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive of bipersonal
      Intransitives are formed after the pattern of monopersonal Intransitives, i.e. by the
      addition of the Aorist Indicative or Aorist Subjunctive respectively of the copula.
      For example, take the Indirect Verb (and Indirect Verbs are formally identical to
      bipersonal Intransitives in Series III) in romel-sa-c še+u+jl+eb+el-i-a e+s
      si+t'q'v-eb-i da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-i-q'+o 'who it is impossible to have forgotten these
      words' (instead of da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-od-a ); instead of ar m-a-xs+ov-s vin+me
      gverd-ze mo-m-jd-om-od-e-s                         'I don't recall anyone sitting down beside me' one
      may hear the III rd Subjunctive formed as m o - m - j d - o m - i - q ' - o - s . An example is
      even available of a monopersonal Perfect replacing the expected bipersonal form: it
      is from the now defunct Paris-basedGEORGIANjournal 'šentinel' (No. 29, 1992, p.6Ø):
      kart+ul-i p'resa a+m gir+s+še+sa+nišn+av mo+vl+en+a-s ar g a - m o -
      x m a + u r - e b - u l - a 'theGEORGIANpress has not responded to this significant
      phenomenon' (in place of the 'correct' ga-mo-(Ø-)xma+ur-eb-i-a ).
64    KEGl quotes an alternative ending, namely -ev-i(-t) , when the subject is 1st or 2nd
      person.
65    Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would respectively be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-v-
      i-v-a+r-t, da-(Ø-Ø-)xoc-v-i-x-a+r-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-v-i-an
66    Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(Ø-
      Ø-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen
67
      This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)bad-eb-od-e-t                               'may
      you(Pl.) be born to X/them'.
68    This phonetic form may also mean 'may I/we be born to you(Pl.)' or 'may we be born
      to you'.
69    This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)mal-od-e-t                         'may you(Pl.)
      hide from X/them'.
70    This form may also mean 'may I /we stick to you(Pl.)' or 'may we stick to you'.
71    Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-e-t,                      da-(Ø-
      Ø-)xoc-od-e-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen.
72    This is short for magalit-ad 'for example', and I simply give here a possible fIIIer
      just to offer a flavour of the construction.
73    Though this is 'regular' insofar as the form is bipersonal, since the Masdar is g a -
      xir-v-a , one would have expected this bipersonal form to be ga-g-xir-v-i-a,
      seemingly unattested according to both KEGl and Tschenkčli's dictionary.
74    N.B. Tschenkčli offers a choice for the participial base of such forms by prešenting a
      bracketed element, viz. ga-(Ø-)xir-(eb-)ul-x-a+r .
75
      E.g. ar-c c'in c'a-(?Ø-)e-čr-eb-a, ar-c uk'an ča-mo-dg-eb-a                             'X will neither
      push himself forward nor step back'.
76    As in this example: i+ma-s ver v-(Ø-)i-t'q'v-i, rom šuxart-i srul+i+ad ga-
      rk'v-e-ul-i-q'-o-s                  xan-is (resp.           haes) p'repiks-eb-ad         xmar+eb-is
      sa+k'itx-Si 'I shan't be able to say that Schuchardt gained a complete understanding
      of the question of the use as prefixes of xan (or hae)'.
77    As in: čv+e+ul+eba-d m-a-kv-s mo+u+mzad+eb+1-ad ar-sad c'a-v-(?Ø-)e-
      čxir-o 'I have the practice of not getting involved anywhere unprepared'.
78    An interesting example of the use of such a structurally unmotivated -eb to create a
      formal distinction in Series III not found elsewhere in the paradigms is seen in the
      case of š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' - e b - i - x - a + r   'you apparently went in exile to place X and
      took refuge there', which has Prešent-Future (s'e-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xvec , -eb-i                     and Aorist
      ( š ) ( Ø - Ø - ) e - x v e c ' - e . These Series I and II forms are also used in the šense of
      'you (will) beseech X/them', which verb then has the Perfect š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' + n - i - x -
      a+r; this is based on the Masdar ( š ) x v e c ' + n - a 'beseeching; taking refuge', which
      would be expected to underlie Series III for the latter of its šenses too. In the case
                                      VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                             511     of (áe-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xizn-eb-i 'you (will) take refuge in X' (Masdar še-xizvn-a) KEGL
     gives the Perfect as še-(Ø-Ø-)xizvn-i-x-a+r , and yet in the illustrations appended
     to the relevant entry we find an example of the Pluperfect from Tedo Razik'ashvili
     shewing the unmotivated -eb again, viz. bosl-eb-sa da sa+bj+1-eb-s še-(Ø-)
     x i z n - e b - o d - n e n 'they had taken refuge in the animal- and grain-barns'.
79   There can be no doubt about this: KEGL gives as one synonym for (da-)(Ø-)i-c'ok-
     eb-a the (transitive) verb-phrase muxl-s (mo-)(Ø-)i-q'r-i-s , where muxl-i = 'knee'
     and the verb means 'bend'. Thus, the example arčil-i giorg-is login-tan da-
     čok-il-i-q'+o 'Archil had knelt down at the bed of Giorgi' could be paraphrased as
     arčil-s...muxl-i mo-(Ø-)e-q'ar-a. In voluntary buckling of the knees is expressed
     by the bipersonal intransitive verb seen in: vin-me-s muxl-i (mo-)(Ø-)e-č'r-eb-
     a/Amo-)(Ø-)e-k'vet-eb-a, literally 'the knee is/will be cut//sliced for someone'.
80   For my review see Hewitt (1983a).
81   There are two types of exception: (i) Medials which have no Future Sub-Series but
     which would have employed this combination of affixes to form the non-existent
     screeves, had they existed, and (ii) a small number of irregular Medials which use
     only the prefix i- to form the Future Sub-Series.
82   Taking an example like the following from Literary Georgia (18 Nov 1988, p. 15): c ' a -
     val da šv+il-eb-sa-c da-v-(Ø-)xoc-av, tav-s ar v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb                          'I shall go
     and kill (my) children; I shall not allow myself to live', we assume tav-s v-(Ø-)i-
     cocxl-eb 'I shall allow myself to live' became v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb 'I shall be/remain
     alive'.
83   There are a number of examples where a Series 111 screeve of some Medial is
     presented (sc. other than in actual citations from literature) at different places in the
     8-volume KEGL, now with the nasal, now without it.
84   This is the ceremony when, during the lying-in-state at home in the days before the
     funeral, visitors come to pay their respects by ritualistic weeping over the corpse.
85   Some Medials in -av produce their Perfects like normal Transitive Verbs in -av (e.g.
     (Ø-)bobg-av = (Ø-)bordg-av = (Ø-)xox-av 'you crawl' have Perfects g - i - b o b g -
     a v - s = g-i-bordg-av-s = g-i-xox-av-s, and yet (Ø-)čoč-av 'you crawl' has the
     Perfect g-i-čoč-(?n-)-a!
86   Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: varaud-ad a+r-i-s 'it is as a supposition'
     or s a - v a r a u d - o - a 'it is a matter for supposition'.
87   Cf. the synonym based on a cognate form: sa-grjn-ob-i-a 'it is perceptible'.
88   Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: na-gul+is+xm-ev-i-a 'it is meant' or s a -
     gul+is+xm-eb-el-i-a 'it is to be meant'.
89   Wherever this o-vowel is absent in the paradigm, the labio-dental is restored, as in
     the Future (?Ø-)i-gor-av-eb-s 'X will roll around'.
90   This sort of verb, discussed under 2.5 with reference to sound-symbolism, is a typical
     member of the Medial class.
91   There is also (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'X brings (will bring) rain' (e.g. k a r - i guria-ši
     xšir-ad (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'the wind often brings rain to Guria').
92   With Objective Version we have ši+mš+il-it gul-i m-i-c'ux-s 'my heart is heavy
     through hunger', or, from the inceptive, kal-s gul-i (Ø-)u-c'ux-d-eb-od-a                        'the
     woman's heart was turning sad'.
93   For both m o - c u r - a v - s and m i - c u r - a v - s there is a full set of paradigms, so that
     the meanings respectively are 'X swims (will swim) over here' and 'X swims (will swim)
     over there' (=> Aorist m o - / m i - c u r - a => Perfect mo-/mi-(Ø-)u-cur-av-s ).
94   Note a cognate synonym formed as a bipersonal (but monovalent) Intransitive Verb,
     viz. da-(?Ø-)e-xet'-eb-a.
95   Only the form with indirect object is quoted by KEGL when the preverb is da-.
96   Note the shift of Thematic Suffix from -ob without indirect object to -eb here. The
     verb may be used as in the expression av+ad+m+q'+op-is t'uč-eb-s gim+il-i da-
512                                      GEORGI AN GRAMMAR      s-tamaS-eb-d-a = ga-mo-h-k'rt-od-a 'a smile was playing around the lips of the
      sick person'.
97 Note that the preverb here is not in the Prešent Sub-Series.
98 Such formations are not limited to Medials. Consider: c ' a - ( Ø - Ø - ) i - č ' 'you will
      have a bite of something to eat'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-loc-av 'you will say a little prayer';
      c'a-i-t'rus-eb-a 'X will get a bit scorched'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-)in-eb 'vou will snatch a
      bit of sleep'; c'a-i-nam-eb-a 'X will get a bit wet with dew'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xems-
      eb = š ( Ø - ) n a q ' r - d - e b - i 'you will snatch a bite of food'.
99 Cf. the unmarked Intransitive Verb (da-)prtx-eb-i 'you (will) take fright' <= (da-)(Ø-
      Ø-)a-prtx-ob 'you (will) alarm X/them' or, with ga- as an alternative preverb, 'you
      (will) frighten and put to flight'. With this compare (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-prtx+il-eb 'you
      (will) warn X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)u-prtx+il-d-eb-i 'you (will) be wary of X/them'
      or 'you (will) treat X/them with care'.
100 E.g. delegat'-eb-i si+am+ovn+eb-it (Ø-)p'asux-ob-en q'ovel+gvar t'q'u+il-
      sa da mo+čven+eb+it še+k'itx+v-eb-s 'the delegates provide answers with
      pleasure to every kind of lie and specious question'.
101 Also the indirect object may be the possessor of the subject (e.g. luarsab-s saxe
      mudam (Ø-)u-cin-od-a 'luarsab's face was always laughing').
102 Cf. bed-i g-i-gim-i-s 'fate smiles on you' (vs bed-i (?Ø-)g-i-muxtl-eb-s 'fate lets
      (will let) you down').
103 Cf. (mo-/mi-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-c , od-eb                 -tan 'you (will) issue a call/summons to X/them
       to Y', not to be confused with (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-eb                  'you (will) hand X/them
       to Y/them', produced by back-formation from the Aorist mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-e
       which originally had the (stIII extant) Prešent-Future (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'vd-i
       with the Intransitive (Ø-)s-c'vd-eb-l 'you reach out and attain/touch X/them'; any
      appropriate preverb is used (as indeed for the corresponding Transitive) to produce
       the perfective screeves (e.g. Future m o - / m i - / a - 7 g a - / ( 5 a - ( Ø - ) s - c , v d - e b - i =>
       Aorist mo-/mi-/a-/ga-/ča-(Ø-)s-c'vd-i                  => Perfect m o - / m i - / a - / g a - / š a - ( Ø - ) s -
       c'vd-om-i-x-a+r).
1Ø4 Note that there is no preverbless Prešent to this Future, for (Ø-Ø)a-)ax-eb is the
       (pseudo-)Causative 'you (will) make X/them shout' (Perfect g-i-)ax-eb-i-a ).
1° 5 For mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)ax-eb cf. Transitive (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xl-i 'you (will)
      bring X/them crashing against Y/them; you (will) shoot X/them at Y/them; you (will)
      hurl verbal X at Y/them'.
1Ø6 NO form with mo- is quoted.
1Ø7 Note the prešence of the Thematic Suffix -eb, which means that this is not simply
       the basic Medial plus preverb.
1Ø8 This example using either of the transitive synonyms would inGEORGIANbe: (i)
       Prešent-Future pot-a-mde or dge-s (mo-)v-(Ø-Ø-)a-nd+om-eb                                         = (še-)v-
       (Ø-Ø-)a-l-ev        si+a+r+ul-s, (ii) Aorist pot-a-mde or-i dge mo-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-
       nd+om-e = še-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-l-i-e si+a+r+ul-s , (iii) Perfect pot-a-mde or-i dge
       mo-m-i-nd+om-eb-1-a = še-m-i-1-ev-i-a si+a+r+ul-is-tvis
 109 Presumably a second Dative (such as game-s 'night' or p'eriod-s 'period') is
       understood.
 110. E.g. č'+a k+on-eb-a-ze h-k'id-i-a 'eating hangs on having' = 'how one eats
       depends on what one has'.
 111 For which c'ign-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in either
       the prešent or the future.
 112
     One of the two labio-dentals in such collocations may be omitted.
 113 For which malmun-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in
       either the prešent or the future.
 114 The archaic mo-m-e-sm-i-s (etc..) is also sometimes stIII found.
 115 For the preverbal form KEGl quotes the Perfect as mo-m-sm-i-a.
                                         VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                                513
116 The only example given by KEGl has the recipient of the information governed by
    the postposition - t a n . However, the preradical - a - is surely the locative Version in
    origin, and if we note that with preverb š                    this same meaning is possible and that
    the recipient may stand in the Dative as indirect object (e.g. me+p+e vaxt'ang ...
    q'een-s š ( Ø - Ø - ) a - s m - i n - e s   'they informed on King Vaxt'ang to the khan'), it is
    likely that the Dative too will be possible with preverb da-.
117 In the šense of 'accept a proposal/plea', in which case it is synonymous with (še-)(Ø-
    Ø-)i-c'q'nar-eb.
118 Sometimes found without preverb even in the normally perfective screeves.
119
    The antonym is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'un-eb.
120 Not to be confused with (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'q'-eb 'you (will) begin X/them'.
121 N.B. such Prešent Sub-Series only formations as c ' a - ( ? Ø - ) i - b o r š č - e b - s 'it
    resembles borshch', c ' a - ( ? Ø - ) i - m e + c n + i e r - e b - s 'X makes himself out to be a
    scholar/scientist'.
122 Cf. from sa+c'q'+al-i 'wretched' we get the similarly formed tav-s (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-
    sa+c'q'+l-eb 'you (will) make yourself out to be wretched', and from m-k'vd-ar-i
    'dead' we have tav-s (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-m+k'vd+ar-un-eb 'you                             (will) pretend to be
    dead'.
123 Also for this šense in the Prešent Sub-Series only we have g-i-mjim-s (from mjime
    'heavy'), as in mo+x+u+c-s suntk+v+a (Ø-)u-mjim-d-a = (Ø-)u-č'ir-d-a 'the old
    man found breathing difficult'.
124 Cf. the figurative expression k'ač'k'ač'-s ga-(?Ø-Ø-)a-civ-a da ga-(?Ø-Ø-)a-
    cx+el-a äiä-isa-gan 'the magpie got a cold and hot fever from fear'. 'Fever' =
    c i + e b - c x + e l + e b a , where the root -ci(v)- indicates 'cold'. We have a similar type
    of construction for the expression ' X D A T comes out in a rash', as seen in the
    following example, where only the agent of the verb remains unstated: bavšv-s mtel
    t'an-ze m u c ' u k ' - e b - i ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-q'ar-?a                 'the child came out in spots all
    over his body'.
125
    Holisky (1981.129) quotes (?Ø-)e-civ-eb-a, but this is not given by                      KEGl
126 As an ailment 'cold' is surdo (e.g. surdo m-a-kv-s 'I have a cold') vs grip'-i 'flu'.
127 The older form of the root was - t ' p - and it is assumed to be a borrowing from the
    Indo-European root that gives us 'tepid'. TheGEORGIANcapital, Tbilisi, literally means
    '(the place) of something warm', usually taken to refer to the hot natural springs of
    the area. The older form of the root gave rise, through Persian, to the former
    English designation of Tiflis.
128 On the same principle one has gril-a 'it is cool' => Future si+gril+e i-kn-eb-a or
    (?Ø-)e-gril-eb-a, which latter may also function with a true indirect object as a
    synonym for (Ø-)u-gril-d-eb-a 'X becomes cool for Y' => Imperfect gril-od-a 'it
    was cool' (cf. s i - g r i l - e 'coolness', g r i l - i 'cool'), without being able to form an
    Indirect Verb from it, as well as bnel-a 'it is dark' (cf. s i - b n e l - e 'darkness', b n e l - i
    'dark') => Future (?Ø-)e-bnel-eb-a or si+bnel+e i-kn-eb-a.
129
    Holisky (1981.129) but not KEGl quotes (?Ø-)e-tb+il-eb-a for the Future.
130 Or should we analyse g-e-t'k'-in-eb-a?
131 In the Future a - g - t V i v - a is also possible.
132 -tvin is an older form of -tvis 'for'.
133 Between vowels the -v- is optional.
134 It would appear that the origin of the sequence -ši(v)- lies in the Aorist of this
    earlier form (viz. mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-m+š-i-e 'you made X/them hungry').
135 Sometimes the preradical - e - is (incorrectly) altered to -i-.
136 Cf. (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)e-vač'r-eb-i 'you haggle with X/them over the price of Y' => Aorist
     (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)e-vač'r-e => Perfect                  še-rø-?Ø-Ø-)vač'r-eb-i-x-a+r           (e.g. ert u r e m - s

137 In the šense of 'stretch out to get hold of X/them' this verb-form is bipersonal in
     Series III with the Perfect da-(Ø-)šur-eb-i-a i+s ma-s             'X has stretched out to
     grab Y'.
138 KEGl quotes mo-(Ø-Ø-)u-čkar-eb-s pex-s                  as equivalent to a-(Ø-Ø-)u-škar-
     eb-s pex-s, but in the one example quoted (from Vazha Pshavela) we see the noun
     for 'foot' standing in the Nominative (not the Dative) with an Aorist verb-form (viz.
     mo-(Ø-?Ø-)u-čkar-es        m+dev+r-eb-ma-c pex-i             'the pursuers too increased
     their pace'). Cf. nabij-s/si+a+r+ul-s mo-v-(?Ø-Ø-)u-mat'-o-t 'let's increase             our
     pace/walking', and ma+t'ar+eb+el-ma             (?Ø-Ø-)u-mat'-a/(?Ø-Ø-)u-k'l-o    svl+a-s
     'the train increased/decreased its speed (lit. movement)'.
139
     Or should it be g-c'q'+in-s?
140 As a non-Indirect Verb we can have (Ø-)s-jer-x-a+r as a synonym for (Ø-)s-jer-
     d-eb-i 'you are satisfied with X D A T ' .
141 There is a gap here in the Indirect paradigm which is fIIIed by the Medial formation
     from (Ø-Ø-li-c'am-eb 'you will judge X/them credible' => Perfect g-i-c'am-eb-i-a.
142
     E.g. m+mart+v+el+ob-ts si+sul+el-it xalx-i sa+č'm+l-is na+k'1+eb+oba-s
     gan-(Ø-)i-cd-i-s 'through the folly of the government the people are suffering a
     shortage of food'.
143 For which g-e-mjim-eb-a/g-e-mjim-a                 'you deem/deemed X/them heavy' is a
     virtual synonym vs g-e-mčat'-eb-a/g-e-mčat'-a 'you deem/deemed X/them light'.
144 ALL Transitive Verbs (other than those in -av and -am) end in this same sequence in
     the Perfect when their direct object is 3rd person. In OldGEORGIANboth Statives and
     all Transitive Verbs (other than those in -av and -am) in the Perfect ended in the
     sequence -ie-s . This parallelism leads to the hypothesis that in origin today's Perfect
     of Transitive Verbs was a Stative-Resultative formation that was fundamentally
     intransitive with a Nominative subject and Dative indirect object of the interested
     party (indicated by means of the Objective Version). A reinterpretation took place of
     the roles of these two arguments (leading to the Dative becoming the subject and the
     Nominative becoming the direct object) as the hypothesised Resultative was
     assimilated as the modern-day Perfect screeve within the new three-Series verbal
     system as it affected Transitive (and Medial) Verbs.
145 Vogt (1971.158) gives an example in Objective Version with two Datives (viz. ra-c me
     (?Ø-)m-i-k'id-i-a aklem-eb-s, met'-i ar m-i-nd-a               'I want no more than what I
     have suspended on the camels').
146 Out of context such Future Sub-Series and Series II screeves are ambiguous
     between the Stative šense being discussed here and the Dynamic šense, which would
     be 'X is being hung up for Y' for (Ø-)e-k'id-eb-a, whose Future would now be da-
     (Ø-)e-k'id-eb-a vs the Aorist da-(Ø-)e-k'id-a vs the Perfect da-h-k'id-eb-i-a
147 Vogt (1971.157) not only quotes the Objective Versional pul-i (Ø-)u-bar-i-a bank'-
     ši 'X has money deposited at the bank' but also (p. 166) an MP bar-eb-ul-a, neither
     of which appears in KEGl.
148 Vogt has the Objective Versional maril-i (Ø-)u-bn-ev-i-a               'X has salt scattered
     about', which is abšent from KEGl.
149 This is the form given by KEGl, but Shanidze offers h-bj-in-eb-i-a .
150 Also used in the same šense is h - g o n - e b - s ' X N O M thinks Y' (e.g. v-(Ø-)gon-eb
      tav-s p'irvel k'ac-ad 'I suppose myself to be top man').
151 Or is it d+ev-s/j+ev-s?
152 Vogt offers the variant (Ø-)u-dv-i-a .
153 E.g. xalx-ši v-(Ø-)u-r-ev-i-v-a+r           'I am involved with the people' => Perfect v-r-
      e-ul-v-a+r.
154 E.g. for the Perfect bze-s p'ur-is marcval-i (Ø-)r-ev-i-a               'the chaff apparently
     had wheat-grain mixed up in it'.

    Sometimes the Prešent of this verb in particular takes an extra element -n word-
    finally. The full form of the root is -rkv- (cf. tv+it+ma+rkv+i+a 'self-styled').
156 Vogt gives an example with two Dative: imed-i gul-sa (?Ø-)m-p-en-i-a                   'hope is
    cast over my heart'.
157 Is the sequence -q'en- an amalgamation of the copular root - q ' - plus an old
    Causative - e n - ? If someone is already on their feet and you make them stand
    somewhere, this verb is used; if you help someone to their feet, then the preverb a-
    is necessary; for 'cocking a gun' the preverb is š , just as it is for the meaning 'halt'.
158 This form with initial s- is normally used in the šense given. However KEGl gives
    c'er-i-a as the monovalent form, suggesting that when initial s- is prešent the
    meaning is 'be written for X', though the only example quoted for this is the
    colloquialism a+ka+ur+oba-s jvar-i s-c'er-i-a/(ø-)e-c'er-o-sl 'Touch wood!'.
159 Cf. (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-c'q'-ob 'you (will) arrange (e.g. meeting)', (a-XØ-Ø-)a-c'q'-ob
    'you (will) arrange things on or in somewhere', (ča-XØ-Ø-la-c'q'-ob 'you (will)
    arrange things down inside something/get things sorted out by sly means (e.g.
    bribery)'; cf. ra ga-v-(Ø-)a-c'q'-o? 'what can I be expected to do about it?', ra
    ga-(Ø-)e-c'q'-ob-a? 'what is there for it/what's to be done?', xval tu ar g-a-
    c'q'-ob-s, zeg š v - ( Ø - ) x v d - e - t (ert+man+et-s) 'if tomorrow is no          good for
    you, let's meet (each other) the day after tomorrow'.
160 Note the extra element -eb-. Cf. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xil-(v-)eb 'you (will) shew X/them to
    Y/them', though tval-s (Ø-Ø-)a-xil-eb may be used like tval-s (Ø-Ø-)a-xel 'you
    open your eyes'; note also from xil-i 'fruit' the verb (Ø-Ø-Ø-)xil-eb 'you (will) give
    X/them the first taste of some fruit Y' (e.g. st'umr-eb-s q'urjen-i v-(Ø-Ø-)a-xil-
    o-t 'let's give the guests their first taste of grapes'.
161 E.g. nene-m š ( Ø - Ø - ) a - v e d r - a gvt+a+eba-s tav+is-i p'ir+m+š+o                  'Nene
    besought the godhead for protection for her first-born'. A synonym for (še-)(Ø-)e-
     vedr-eb-a is ( i e - X Ø - ) e - x v e c ' - e b - a , from which we have the monopersonal
    derivative in the Prešent Sub-Series only i-xvec'-eb-a 'X is urging, pleading' and
     the parallel Causative (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'-eb 'you (will) ask seek protection for
    X/them DO from Y/them IO'. However, preverbless (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'-eb                      may be
     used in Imeretian like either (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'+n-in-eb              or the strange (Ø-Ø-Ø-)i-
     xvec'+i-eb in the meaning 'you (will) get X/them to beseech Y/them (to do Z)//to ask
     for Y/them (from Z/them)'. Not to be confused with (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'-in-eb
     'you (will) get X/them to polish/refine Y/them' <= Prešent-Future (da-XØ-Ø-)xvec'.
162 In OldGEORGIAN- e v - also functioned as a possible Causative exponent, and a few
     verbs are stIII used with this suffix.
163 Not to be confused with (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-}a-)l-eb-in-eb                  'you empower X/them to
     survive//enable X/them to put up with Y/them' from (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-)jl-eb 'you (will)
     survive/stay' or (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)l-eb 'you (will) put up with X/them' (e.g.
     žang+bad-i          (?Ø-Ø-)a-)l-eb-in-eb-s              m+pr+in+av-s aero+st'at'-it did
     si+magl+e-ze a+pr+en-isa-s 'oxygen allows a pilot to survive when flying at
     great height by balloon').
164 This Causative could also correspond to (ča-XØ-Ø-Ø-)a-cv-am                      'you (will) put
     X/them on Y/them' (Perfect ča-g-i-c-m-ev-i-a -tvis), in which                case the original
     indirect object would appear as postpositional object of - t v i s , e.g. deda mama-s
     p'alt'o-s (ša-)(Ø-Ø-)a-c-m-ev+in-eb-s bavSv-is-tvis                   , which in Series III
     produces a second postpositional phrase with - t v i s , viz. deda-s mam-is-tvis
     p'alt'o ča-(Ø-)u-c-m-ev+in-eb-i-a bavSv-is-tvis
165
     The Conditional is (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-i-d-i.
166
     The Imperfect/Conditional is (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sc'avl-i-d-i.
167 Cf. the phrase da+xmar+eb+a-s (ga-XØ-Ø-Ø-)u-c'-ev                          'you (will) render
     assistance to X/them'.

170 In the Instrumental xaz-ga-s-m-it 'emphatically, with emphasis'.
171 Note that the incorporated noun in taq'van-is-m-cem-el-i 'worshipper' is in the
    Genitive; cf. gul-Se-ma-t'k'iv-ar-i 'fan', both these undergoing syncope of the
    suffixal vowels - e - and -a- respectively.
172 Though this is one of the Root Verbs which does alter the root in the Intransitive
    (e.g. (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)cvet 'you wear out X/them' vs (ga-)cvd-eb-a 'X wears out'), this
    Masdar may do service for both Transitive and Intransitive forms, even though a
    specifically Intransitive (ga-)cvd-om-a also exists.
173 Note the related part-Indirect verb seen in: jal-i da gone q'vela+per-ši še-m-

220   From the OldGEORGIANform, a+r-s, comes the derived noun a+r+s-i meaning either
      'living creature' (cf. the synonyms a+r+s+eba or sul+dg+m+ul-i) or 'esšence' (cf.
      ra+oba). The OldGEORGIANform also provides the basis for the verbs (da-)(Ø-
      Ø-)a-a+r+s-eb 'you (will) found X/them', (Ø-)a+r+s+eb-ob ( (Ø-)i-a+r+s+eb-eb)
      'you (will) exist' => a+r+s+eb-ob-a 'existence'.
221   Note the expected Mingrelian correlate in the corresponding Prešent Indicative: v-
      o+r-e-k, (Ø-)(o+)r-e-k, (o+)r-e(-n), v-o+r-e-t, (Ø-)(o+)r-e-t, (o+)r-e-n-
      a(n). Mingrelian has a full Prešent Sub-Series for its copula, but the forms that are
      cognate with GEORGI AN's u n d Series paradigms have the meaning 'become' in
      Mingrelian.
222   Note this construction with net'av plus Aorist Indicative with unexpressed 3rd
      person subject for a wish that is esšentially unrealisable.
223    Changing the preverb alters the meaning accordingly (e.g. a-svl-a 'going up', š e -
      mo-svl-a 'coming in').
224   In effect the 3rd person subject-affix here in the modern form is a zero-suffix.
225    When coupled with the preverb c'a-mo- , as in c'a-mo-di(-t) 'Come on along!', the
      preverb alone is often used in Imperative function (viz. c'a-mo!).
226   Cf. m+q'+op+ad-i 'Future Indicative'.
227   For the preverbless form (GEN = sa-val-isa ) cf. mirian-s jnel-sa-val t'q'e-ši
      gza da-(Ø-)e-bn-a 'Mirian lost his way in a difficult-to-negotiate forest'. It may be
      substantivised as in a+k-e+dan ert-i saat-is sa-val-i-a 'from here it is a one
      hour journey'.
228   Cf. še-mo-sa-val-i (GEN = š e - m o - s a - v l - i s a ) 'income, revenue'. As Future
      Participles 'for entry' we have both ša-sa-svl-el-i and š s a - v a l - i (GEN = š s a -
       vl-isa), though the former is used as the noun 'entrance, way in' — cf. ga-sa-val-i
       (GEN = ga-sa-vl-isa 'exit'), the latter as the noun 'introduction (e.g. to a book)'. N.B.
       the nominal use of g a d a - s a - s v l - e l - i 'crossing-point', as in                  mic'+is+kve+š+a
       gada-sa-svl-el-i 'underground-crossing, underpass'; the nominal use of ga-mo-sa-
       val-i with syncopating -a- is 'escape, way out (of problem)'; the nominal use of tav-
       gada-sa-val-i with syncopating -a- is 'series of adventures in life, biography'.
229    The morpheme-division here assumes that -ul- is the participial formant, whereas
       one could also analyse the word as mo-sul-i with - s u l - a variant of the root - s v l -
       seen in the Masdar.
230    Note the ordering of the agreement-affixes here: the Objective Versional complex
       precedes the intransitive subject marker!
231    Even though their III rd Series are formally identical, do not confuse this verb with
       Future ga-(Ø-)i-vl-eb-s, Aorist ga-(Ø-)i-vl-o, Perfect ga-(Ø-)u-vl-i-a (ra+me-
       ze, as in xanjal-ze xel-i g a - r ø - ) i - v l - o / m o - ( Ø - ) i - v l - o / c ' a - ( Ø - ) i - v l - o   'X
       snatched hold of his dagger'. Note the formally bivalent intransitive form of this verb
       with m o - in the handy expression mag sa+km+e-s mo-(Ø-)e-vl-eb-a, da-(Ø-)
       m š v i d - d - i ! 'that matter will get sorted out, calm down!', where there is no
       Nominative subject external to the verb. This form can also be used (i) in the šense of
       'land on top of' (viz. mt'red-i tav-ze mo-(Ø-)e-vl-o bič'-s                           'the pigeon landed on
       the lad's head') and (ii) as a parallel to the form with preverb š e - m o - in the
                                       VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                           519    expression for 'encircle' (viz. jar-i rk'al-i-vit (gar+s) ( š ) m o - g v - e - v l - o         š
    mo-gv-e-rt'q'-a 'the army surrounded us like a circle'). The expression tav-
    s/tav-ze š e - m o - g - e - v l - e is used as an expression of affection, especially by a
    parent or elder to a child, from the traditional belief that moving round a troubled
    person takes that person's suffering away: cf. g - e - n a + c v + a l - e 'darling' (lit. 'I
    changed places with you') or šen-i č'ir-i me [gad-mo-m-i-vid-e-sj                     'darling' (lit.
    'your woe upon me [may it come overj').
232
    The Aorist is Weak: gan-v-(Ø-)vl-e(-t), gan-(Ø-Ø-)vl-e(-t), gan-(Ø-)vl-es.
233 Also possible (with 3rd person Nominative subject) is (Ø-)e-jd-om-eb-a, though this
    form (along with the variant (Ø-)e-)d-om-il-eb-a ) is perhaps more frequent as an
    Indirect Verb, used in the Prešent Sub-Series only, in the šense of 'X has a hankering
    to sit down' (e.g. ra m-e-jd-om-(il-)eb-a, kal-o, xom bevr-i sa+km+e m-a-
    kv-s? 'why should I want to sit down, woman, I have a lot of things to do, don't I ?').
234 Also used substantivally in the šense of 'bottom'.
235 less common in da-sa-jd-om-el-i (with syncopating - e - ).
236 In speech (Ø-)u-dg-a is possible.
237 The Prešent Sub-Series Indirect Verb meaning 'X is able to stand' (usually negated) is
    (Ø-)e-dg-om-eb-a or ( Ø - ) e - d g - o m - i l - e b - a   or   (Ø-)e-dg-om-in-eb-a (e.g.
    p'art'izan-ta rig-eb-ši               ar (Ø-)e-dg-om-eb-od-a          'X was not able to
    stand/remain in the ranks of the partisans').
238 The I I I r d Series may also be based on the preverbless Masdar of (da-)(Ø-Ø-)dg-
    am 'you put X/them in a standing position', namely dg-m-a , to give v-(Ø-)dg-m-i-
    v-a+r, v-(Ø-)dg-m-od-i, v-(Ø-)dg-m-od-e etc...
239 An indirect object may be added without any versioniser (e.g. sp'ilo mt'er-s pex-
    eb-it š s - d g - e b - a da sul da-(Ø-)č'q'let'-s        'an elephant will stand on its enemy
     with its feet and completely squash it').
240 Is the root -c'ev- or should it rather be -c'+ev- ?
241 unlike the equivalent Stative roots 'be seated' and 'be standing' KEGl quotes no
    parallel Indirect Verb for this root with such a šense as 'X can/wants to be lying'.
242 Note that pursuit of some activity without any reference within the verb to a
    recipient requires the use in the Prešent Sub-Series of the bivalent Intransitive form
    of this root (e.g. xalx-i gan+ma+tav+is+up+1+eb+el om-s (Ø-)e-c'-ev-a
     imp'erializm-is c'ina+ag+m+deg 'the people are engaged in a war of liberation
    against imperialism'), and yet outside the Prešent Sub-Series Transitive forms are
    employed (viz. agit'acia-s ga-(Ø-)s-c'-ev-s//agit'acia ga-(Ø-)s-c'-i-a                         a+m
    k'andidat'-is sa+sa+rg+eb+1+o-d 'X will//did engage in agitation in favour of this
    candidate').
243 This is also used as a substantive equivalent to login-i 'bed' = sa+jil+e.
244 Is the root -dev-/-)ev- or should it be -d+ev-/-)+ev-?
245 Not to be confused with s-d-ev-s (Aorist s-d-i-a , with no Series III) 'X follows
     after Y/them'.
246 Cf. ga-mo-m-c-em-el-i with syncopating vowel 'publisher',               ga-mo-m-c-em-1-oba
     'publishing house'.
247 If this is 'knowing' in the šense of wisšen, savoir, (ga-XØ-Ø-)i-cn-ob 'you (will)
     know (person(s))' is used in the šense of kennen, connaître.
248 Cf. the derived noun uc'q'+i+s-i 'official list of names', and the verbs sa+oc+ar
     ambav-s (Ø-)gv-a-uc'q'-eb-en 'they are informing/will                 inform us of surprising
     news', k'oresp'ondent'-i (Ø-)i-uc'q'-eb-a, rom...                'the correspondent reports
     that...', inglis-is m+k'itx+v+el sa+zog+ad+o+eba-s (Ø-)e-uc'q'-a rom... 'it was
     reported to the English reading public that...', for which last verb-form no Series III
     exists.
249 N.B. the derived adjective u-v+i+c-i 'ignorant', which gives the abstract noun u-
     v+i+c-oba 'ignorance'. Cf. u-c+od+in-ar-i 'ignorant, uneducated' => u-c+od+in-
     ar-oba 'ignorance'.
52Ø                                 GEORGI AN GRAMMAR250 Do not confuse this verb with the Indirect Verb (še-)g-e-cod-eb-i 'you (will) pity
    me'.
251 From vin (Ø-)i-c-i-s?            'Who knows?' is derived the complex conjunction
    vin+i+c+oba+a 'if perchance, in case'.
252 N.B. da-tk-m-ul dro-s 'at the appointed time', š t k - m - u l - e b a 'plot', gada-tk-m-
    a 'gainsaying, renouncing'.
253 Note the semantic difference between such pairs as: a-rč-e-ul(-i) i-kn-a vs a-rč-
    e-ul-i i-q'+o : the former is dynamic 'X was elected (e.g. in the election)' vs the
     latter which is the stative 'X was (in a state of having been) elected'. However, in an
     article in literary Georgia (1 June 199Ø, p.5) by Zurab Sardzhveladze we see that in
     speaking on two occasions of one and the same event (viz. the invention of the Greek
     alphabet) he employs in the first instance the copula plus Past Participle, whilst in the
     second he utilises the dynamic passive of the same verb, which in this case is of the
     synthetic type.         The first example is: sa+varaud+o-a,                   rom berjn+ul-i
     da+m+c'er+1+oba p'ir+v+el-i at+as+c*l+eul-is mi+jn+a-ze i-q'-o-s                             škmn-
     il-i 'it is to be supposed that Greek writing was created on the threshold of the first
     mIIIennium [sc. B.C.j' vs (Ø-)varaud-ob-en, rom e+s                         tav+da+p'ir+v+el-i
     berjn + ul-i        an+ban-i         u+nd+a š e - k m n - i l - i - q ' + o e r t + o b + l + i v - i
     Se+mo+km+ed+eb-is Je+deg+ad 'they suppose that this proto-type Greek
     alphabet must have been created as the result of joint creativity'.
254 This is rather reminiscent of the construction with ga-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-šv-i kal-i                      'you
     let the womanNOM go'-
255 This word is also used in the šense of m+xed+v+el+oba 'sight' (cf. also the phrase
     m+xed+v+el+oba-ši mi-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-eb                 'you         will       take      X/them       into
     view/consideration'). Cf. also xed-i 'sight = what is in vision, view', for which
     sa+nax+a+oba is also used, though this latter may also mean 'something worth
     seeing'.
256 This verb-form may also mean 'get better (in health)' (e.g. av+ad+m+q'+op-ma m o -
     (?Ø-)i-xed-a = mo-(?Ø-)i-k*et-a = av+ad+m+q'+op-i u+k'et ga-xd-a 'the sick
     person got better').
257 Also possible are i-nax-v-eb-a and the older pattern i-nax-v-i-s
258 N.B. (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)i-xil-av 'you (will) examine your own X(s)', which contrasts with the
     specific meaning attaching to the older form of this preverb seen in (gan-)(Ø-Ø-)i-
     xil-av 'you (will) examine/discuss X/them'.
259 As a noun q'ur-i = 'ear'.
260 When used with this i-suffix, as it more usually is, the Imperfect is formed by -od- .
261
     Cf. (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)a-čer-d-eb-i         = (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)a-šter-d-eb-i              (Aorist mi-(Ø-Ø-)a-
     čer-d-i = mi-(Ø-Ø-)a-št'er-d-i , Perfect mi-(Ø-)s-čer-eb-i-x-a+r                          = mi-(Ø-
     Ø-)št'er-eb-i-x-a+r ). Cf. the formal Perfect š ( Ø - ) s - č e r - e b - i - x - a + r , which is
     used only as a Prešent Indicative in the meaning 'you stare fixedly at X/them' (with
     the formal Pluperfect še-(Ø-)s-čer-eb-od-i and III rd Subjunctive                    še-(Ø-)s-čer-
     eb-od-e being used as Imperfect Indicative and Prešent Subjunctive respectively.
262 Mingrelian has a Thematic Suffix -an- (e.g. r - t i r - a n - s 'X changes you').
263 The animate root is used when the object is a car, when used as a synonym for the
     verb in (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'-ev mo+sa+val-s           'you (will) gather in the harvest', and
     when the object is 'example' (e.g. še+sa+per-i(s-i) magalit-i mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van-e
     'you adduced an apposite example').
264 Note how the expression 'who among you' is formed, namely by associating the
      interrogative pronoun with a 2nd person form of the verb. For a verb close in
     meaning to the one IIIustrated cf. (da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-bgauč'-eb-i                 'you (will) cling onto
     X/them' (e.g. bavšv-i ded-is k'alta-s            (Ø-)e-bgauč'-eb-od-a                'the child was
      clinging onto its mother's hem').
265 Cf. (da-)(Ø-)s-jer-d-eb-i ra-s-me           = (da-)(Ø-)k'ma+q'+op+il-d-eb-i r-iti-me
      'you are (will be) satisfied with something'.

    One would perhaps prescriptively have expected the last clause to read še-(Ø-)g-a-
    xved+r-a ¿em-i tav-i with the 1st person direct object transformed into the 3rd
    person periphrasis, allowing the (2nd) person marker remaining in the verb to
    correlate with the indirect object, but perhaps Vazha Pshavela here prefers the 1st
    person affix in the verb to keep the focus of attention on the 1st person direct
    object, who is the beneficiary of this chance-meeting. In place of a Dative indirect
    object with this verb one may also find the relevant nominal being governed by the
    postposition -tan.
267 Not to be confused with ga-(Ø-)jex-i(-t) 'satiate yourself.
268 Also cognate are the verbs (Ø-Ø-)s-jgvn-i 'you (will) prešent X/them to Y/them as a
    gift' and in the Prešent Sub-Series only (Ø-Ø-)s-)gvn-ob 'you convey gift/greeting
    X to Y/them'.
269
    In the second IIIustration offered by KEGl (vol. VIII) the meaning is rather 'agree
    with X on Y' with two Dative nominals (viz. gio tamasuk-is da+c'er+a-ši ert
    katam-s (?Ø-)gv-jer-d-eb-a 'in writing a note acknowledging the debt Gio comes
    to agreement with us on one chicken'), for which meaning KEGl gives the gloss h-
    q'abul-d-eb-i , though the only example for this verb where the entity agreed upon
    is stated has it not in the Dative but governed by -ze (viz. da-h-q'abul-d-a at
    tuman-ze 'X agreed with Y on ten tenners').
270 In response to the greeting ro+gora x-a+r-t? 'How are you?' one may say tkven
    ro+gor g-i-k'itx-o-t? as the translation-equivalent of 'And how are you?.
271 Cf. ma-txov-ar-i (with syncopating suffixal vowel) or ma-txov-ar-a (Genitive in
    -ar-a-s ) 'beggar'.
272 Recall that this is the regular Aorist conjugation for the root, as in (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-
    Ø-)a-k'l-eb 'you (will) subtract X/them from Y/them'.
273 E.g. ded-is juju maga-s š ( Ø - ) r g - e b - i - a                 'X's mother's breast evidently did X
    some good'.
274 E.g. m - k ' b - e n - a r - a jagl-i/k'b+il-i            'biting dog/tooth' vs m-c'ixl-av-s c'in da-
    (Ø-)u-dg-eb-i-an,              m - k ' b - e n - a r - s uk'ana-o 'they will stand in front of a kicker
    and behind a biter, they say'.
275 N.B. t'uš-ze/tit-ze (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'b-en                         'you (will) bite yourself on the lip/finger in
    realisation and regret at something' vs ena-ze (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'b-en                             'you (will) bite
     yourself on the tongue to stop yourself saying anything further'.
276 For a more regular formation in perfective screeves consider the form in the
    proverb: buz-i rom tav-ze da-g-bzu-i-s, k'ogo-c maä+in da-g-k'b-en-s-o
    'While the fly is buzzing around your head, the mosquito too will then bite you, they
    say'.
277 Also heard, though condemned by prescriptivists, is (Ø-Ø-)i-a+xl-eb-i.
278 Without preverb this verb-form means 'mention': N.B. the saying when someone
    hiccups vin g-a-xs+en-eb-s? 'who is mentioning you?' (= vi-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-gon-
     d-i? 'who has recalled you?'). With ga- or š                       the verb-form means 'remind X/them
     of Y/them' (e.g. da+vic'q'+eb+ul-i da+p'ir+eb+a š / g a - ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) a - x s + e n - e
     direkt'or-s 'remind the director of (his) forgotten promise').
279 This is the Causative of (da-)(Ø-Ø-)?s-c-em 'you (will) knock X/them down', and the
     obligatory noun in this expression for 'sneeze' is cxvir-i 'nose'.
280 This example from D. Mačxaneli is quoted in KEGl under d a a m t k n a r e b s .
281 This is in addition to a separate synthetic form that corresponds inGEORGIANto a
     Transitive Verb in the Imperfect Indicative but with an indirect object alongside the
     direct object (e.g. from the lashkh dialect x-(Ø-Ø-)a-gm-ina""-x-i =GEORGIAN(Ø-Ø-
     Ø-)u-šen-eb-d-i t u r m e 'you were building X/them for Y/them apparently').
282 Note how the Prešent-Stative formant - i - is treated as part of the root here.
283 Such is the form prešented by Topuria on pp. 132-133, but on p. 135 the same Svan
     form (= lә-m-č'ued-iel) is rendered as na-k'itx-eb-a , with -eb- replacing -av- .

5    Syntax5.Ø General SyntaxOnceGEORGIANverbal morphology has been mastered, the syntax of the
language is reasonably straightforward. Its subordinate clauses, unlike
those of North Caucasian languages, do not differ markedly from the
familiar structures of typical Indo-European languages with their use of
conjunctions plus interplay of indicative and subjunctive finite verb-forms.
However, so that those interested in syntax can approach this chapter
without necessarily having to work through all the detail prešented in the
preceding chapters (especially Chapter 4), I now include a short resumé of
the non-syntactic component ofGEORGIANgrammar.","[525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542]"
"5.2.2.3.1.2 Direct Quotation
The three speech-particles are: -me+tk+i, which derives from me v-(Ø-)
tkv-i I I-(it-)say-AOR.INDIC '1 said (it)', and which, naturally, is used when
a 1st person singular speaker is repeating his own words; -tko//-tkv+a,
which derives from (Ø-Ø-)tkv-a (you-it-)say-AOR.SUBJ 'you should say
(it)', and which is used either when a 1st person speaker is instructing the
addressee what words to repeat or when a 1st person speaker (singular or
plural) is repeating his//their own words; -o is used in all other
circumstances, also being possible when the speaker is 1st person plural.

"5.1.6.2 Disjunction
The simple equivalent of '(either...) or' is (an...) an, and this is true for
disjunctive conjunction of words, phrases or clauses (e.g. an si+k'vd+il-i
an ga+marjv+eb+a 'either death or victory'). When an is translateable
by 'or', it may take the ancient form anu (e.g. cocxal-i anu m+k'vd+ar-i
'alive or dead'), which latter is often found when in English we would have
'or rather/or, if you prefer/or, as some say, etc.', e.g.   nigvz-eb-i        anu,   ro(+)gor+c     zog+gan

This strategy employs rom accompanied by appropriate changes of person,
though the tense of the quoted verb remains what it was at the moment of
speech/thought, e.g.   tav-ši mo-(Ø-)u-vid-a              pikr-i,       rom o+de+s+me

   The thought came into X's head that someday (s)he would lose patience'    Regardless of the construction employed, the use of deictic and spatio-
temporal markers seems to be quite free, either that which was appropriate
at the moment of speech/thought or that appropriate at the moment of
citation being permitted, as long as the precise reference is clear from the
context.
    For a fuller discussion of speech-reporting inGEORGIAN(and other
Caucasian languages) see Hewitt and Crisp (1986). For a separate study of
the particle - t k o / - t k v - a see Hewitt (1982) or, in English and with
corrections to the earlier German translation, (1984). On parataxis in
Caucasian languages and the relevance thereto of direct quotation see
Hewitt (1984a) or, in German translation, (1984b). For a peculiarity of
speech-reporting in the related Svan language see Hewitt (1982a).","[634, 635, 636]"
