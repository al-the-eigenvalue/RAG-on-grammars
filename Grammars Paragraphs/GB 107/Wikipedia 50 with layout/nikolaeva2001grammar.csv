9.6.2.2.3. Negative functionNegative pronouns and adverbs are morphologically identical to the
non-specific Interrogative pronouns and adverbs formed with the particle -dA,
for example: ile-de 'nowhere', ali-de (or ali-ali-de) 'never', ni:-de 'nobody',
ni:-zi-de 'with nobody', j'e-uxi-de 'to nowhere' (LAT), j'e-we-de 'nothing'
(ACC). In other words, the polarity of the indefinite non-specific pronouns
depends on the general polarity of the sentence in which they occur. On the use
of the negative pronouns and adverbs, see 23.2.
   Note also the negative adverb: emne-de 'not even once' (from emne 'once').
The numeral omo 'one' followed by the particle -do means 'not a single' under
the scope of negation.",[391]
"
23.2.2.1. Contrastive constituent negationWhen a contrastive focus constituent is negated, the contrasting element is also
present in the sentence. It is in some way expressed in the conjoint clause with
the affirmative interpretation. In the negative clause negation is expressed in a
formally regular manner, while the verb in the conjoint clause takes the same
morphological form. Examples (1753) present the negation of the nominal
constituent, examples (1754) the negation of the predicative element of the
copular construction, and example (1755) the negation of the finite verb.(1753) a.   Nua-ni       ei       zugdi-le         e-ini          bagdi

23.2.1.3. Alternating actionWhen the periphrastic construction of alternating action (7.11.1) includes the
positive and the negative form of the same verb, negation is expressed with the
Present stem of the negative verb, the content verb in a bare form, and the
inflected Past or Perfect form of the verb ede- 'become'.",[857]
"
23.1.5.3.2. Alternative indirect questions with negationIn alternative indirect questions with negation the negative alternative is
highlighted and the negative verb e- functions as a predicate of the second
disjunct. As in indirect alternative questions without negation, in non-finite
clauses predicates in both disjuncts are marked with the particle -dA ... -dA
(1695), while in the finite clause the particles -As(i)... -As(i) (1696) or -nu ...
-nu (1697) are present.(1695) a.   Bi ei-mi               sa:      nua-ni           tala-wa

23.2. NegationExcept for some special constructions, Udihe does not make the formal
difference between sentence negation and constituent negation. Examples of
these two negation types are presented below in 23.2.1 and 23.2.2, respectively.
In both cases, negation is expressed with the negative auxiliary verb e-/ei-,
which precedes the content verb and may take various morphological forms,
e.g. e-si-ti etete-du 'they were not working' <NEG-PAST-3PL work-PL>, e-s'e-li
etete 'without having worked' <NEG-PERF-CC.SS work>. For more
information on the conjugation of the negative verb and the form of the content
verb in negative sentences see 7.3 and 7.1.4. In certain copular constructions
negation is expressed by the impersonal copula anci 'no'.
   Normally, the negative verb immediately precedes the content verb;
however, it is sometimes possible for it to be placed after the verbal stem, as
below.(1699) a.   Nada         gida   bul'a-wa-ni                 xai-ge-si

auxiliary and the content verb, as is shown below. This is not a very frequent
option, however. The constituent that can be inserted between the negative verb
and the content verb is normally an oblique or indirect object (1700), or some
kind of adjunct (1701).(1700) a.   E-te-mi-ne                  zugdi-tigi       i:mi    i: ?

23.2.1. Sentence negation23.2.1.1. Regular negationHere we exemplify ordinary sentence negation (1702) and negation of some
special constructions: the subjectless sentence (1703a), the agentless passive
(1703b), the active agentless construction (1703c), the impersonal
Necessitative (1703d), and the passive (1703e).","[853, 854, 855]"

23.2.1.7. Negative wordsUdihe does not exhibit negative concord. No overt negative elements appear
under the scope of sentence negation. Non-specific indefinite pronouns formed
with the clitic particle -dA (9.6.2) function as negative pronouns.
  Either the negative word itself (1749) or the noun phrase with the negative
modifier (1750) must be strictly preverbal. In subjectless existential
constructions the negative word is located before the predicative noun (1751).(1749) a.   J'e-we-de             a-ta-i                  b'a si.

            'There is nobody in the house.'",[869]
"
23.2.1.2. Inchoative negative constructionInchoative situations in the Past can be negated in two ways, depending on the
scope of negation. If the negation takes scope over the whole proposition ('did
not start doing something'), this is expressed formally in a regular manner:
with the negative verb in the Past and the content verb bearing the inchoative
suffix -li- (8.2.2.1). When the inchoative operator remains outside the scope of
negation ('started not doing something', that is, 'stopped doing something'),
Udihe uses a special construction. It indicates that the action no longer takes
place. The construction contains (in this order) the Present form of the negative
verb e-i, the bare stem of the content verb, and the verb ede- 'become' in the
Past tense with the corresponding agreement affix. Cf. (1705a) and (1705b):(1705) a.   Ñ'aula       e-si-ni                 sotjo-li.

12.1.1.4.1. Meaning 'again, once more'The semantic difference between ña and xai(si) is hard to estimate and in fact
these two particles can co-occur. In (852) we present examples of the particle
ña with the meaning 'again'.(852) a.    Bi           abuga-i          ña      rjua-ìni.
            me           father-1SG       again   sleep-3SG

            ""The whale appeared again.' (K 117)Within a negative polarity sentence the meaning of this particle is 'not anymore'
(853). However, it cannot express the meaning 'not yet', as xaíjí does (12.1.1.1.2).(853) a.    Ña           e-zetje-i                eme-gi.
            again        NEG-FUT-1SG              come-REP

"
23.2.1.5.3. Negation of a construction with a personal copulaCopular constructions that express a temporal state and normally require a
personal non-habitual copula (17.1.1) are negated with the negative verb e- in
the corresponding personal form and the content verb 'be' in the form bie. This
negation type is, therefore, formally similar to the negation of non-copular
constructions (23.2.1.1). In (1718) the negative adjectival construction with
non-habitual copula is illustrated, in (1719) the construction with a quantifier,
in (1720) the adverbial construction, in (1721) the nominal copular
construction, and in (1722) the resultative construction. In adjectival
constructions the adjective may precede the negative verb as in (1718a), but it
may also be located between the negative verb and the verb bie, as in (1718b)
and (1718c).(1718) a.   Si zueze-i           imexi   e-ini            bie.

"
23.2.1.6.4. Generalized relative clauseAffirmative generalized relative clauses can be both finite (18.3.2.1) and
non-finite (19.5.2), but in the negative form only the non-finite construction is
allowed. Sentences with the generalized negative relative clause express the
non-existence of the class of objects characterized by the relative clause. The
superordinate clause of such sentences is a negative existential construction
with the existential negative copula anci. The relative clause is headed by an
indefinite non-specific pronoun (9.6.2) with the negative interpretation, or an
expletive word such as ba: 'place, nature'. The relative clause predicate
corresponds to the Destinative Participle (7.6.1.4). Like the regular relative
clause (Chapter 19), the generalized negative relative clause can be prenominai
or postnominal.
   In prenominai clauses the Destinative Participle is not marked by a personal
inflection. In most cases it immediately precedes the head (indefinite pronoun)
as in (1743), but can be extraposed as well (1744). The Future passive
participle can occasionally function as the predicate of such a relative clause
832   Questions and negation
(1745). The prenominai negative generalized relative clause normally has an
impersonal interpretation.(1743) a    Diga-kci     j'eu-de anéi.
            [eat-DP       what-IND]       no

            [go-DP       place-3SG]       no
            'There is no place to go.'","[867, 868]"
"
12.1.1.3.3. The emphatic focus functionThe particle -dA can be used in order to emphasize the assertion associated
with the corresponding element without bringing about the additive meaning.
In other words, the element within its scope expresses new information that is
not necessarily construed as ""additive"". Such a focus particle takes scope over
any sort of constituent, for example, a subject (845), a predicate (846), and a
postpositional phrase (847). It easily co-occurs with other elements that
normally bear the focus in the sentence, such as the negative auxiliary (848a), a
quantified NP (848b), or an emphatic reflexive pronoun (848c).",[476]
"
9.5.1.3. Tag question functionThe pronoun j'eu in the Nominative can express a tag question. The verb may
be either in the affirmative or in the negative form. The pronoun is typically
used sentence-finally, however in (626e) it precedes the verb.(626) a.     Em'e-i                  j'eu?
             come.PERF-2SG          what

9.5.1.4. SubstantivizationThe pronoun j'eu when substantivized can mean 'things, belongings, property',
as illustrated in the following example:(627)    Sita-na-fi             j'e-ne-fi                b'a-nti          teu

         'Having had children and property they carried on living.' (K 200)9.5.2. Interrogative pro-adjectivesSome of the interrogative adjectives are derived from the j'e- base while others
are from adverbial interrogative stems (9.5.3). These are:
352 Pronouns(628) adi                'how many, how much'
      ja-ma              'made of what'                   <what-ADJ>
       ono-fi            'what sort of                    <how-ADJ>
      ali-fi             'what sort of, from what time'   <when-ADJ>
      adi-(n)ti          'which (in number)'              <how.many-ORD>
      adi(-ma)           'how many, how much'             <how.many-ADJ>

      wogdime            'how many'Syntactically, these elements behave like other pronominal modifiers (13.4).
  The repetition of the adjective adi(ma) causes the indefinite meaning:
adi(ma) adi(ma) 'several', or the distributive meaning: adi adi 'how many to
each'. Note also ono-bui-ono-bui 'various'.","[385, 386]"

23.1.2. Yes-no questionsYes-no questions are not marked by any additional morphological means or
changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence.
They are differentiated from them only by intonational patterns: the last word is
marked by a higher and more prolonged intonational contour (3.6.4). The finite
verb normally occupies the clause-final position. Examples (1675) show
ordinary yes-no questions, and examples (1676) illustrate negative yes-no
questions.(1675) a.   Nua-ni        tue      eme-gi-ze?

23.2.1.5.4. Negation of the ProprietiveThe Proprietive forms with the suffix -xi (4.3.1) are negated in a special way.
The Proprietive forms are not present in the negative construction. Instead, the
826   Questions and negation
possessed noun in the Partitive is combined with the impersonal copula anài.
As in the non-negative counterpart, the construction in question does not
contain any possessive noun phrase. However, as demonstrated in (1725), the
Partitive can be formed from the nominal stem augmented by the suffix of
inalienable possession -ψ-.(1724) a.   Nua-ni       kesi-le        anci.
            he-3SG       luck-PART      no

23.1.4.3. Alternative questions with negationIf in an alternative question the second negative alternative is emphasized, this
is expressed in the second disjunct with negative verb e- which takes the
morphological form of the content verb, or the negative auxiliary anci. Both the
finite verb in the first disjunct and the negative verb in the second disjunct are
followed by the clitic particle -nu... -nu.",[848]
"
17.1.2. Impersonal Habitual copula bie17.1.2.1. FormsThe Habitual copula has the form bie in the Present tense and (bie) bi-s'e in the
Past (see 7.4.2.3). It is impersonal and does not take any agreement affixes. The
Present active participle of the Habitual copula 'be' is also bie. In other
tense/mood categories it does not have any special forms, that is, the difference
between the Habitual and the non-Habitual copula is neutralized. The Habitual
copula cannot be omitted from the sentence.
   The Habitual copula is not negated with the regular negative verb like the
personal verb 'be' (17.1.1), but with the impersonal negative copula anci. The
two semantic types (existential and non-existential/habitual) are negated in
formally distinct ways, see 23.2.1.5. In non-negative sentences there is no
formal difference between the existential and non-existential Habitual copula
constructions.",[645]
"If the subordinate clause contains the existential copular construction, the
impersonal negative copula anci precedes the verb bi- in the corresponding
form, for example, the Perfective Converb in (1739), the Conditional Converb
in (1740), or the Infinitive in (1741). For non-existential copular constructions
                                                                     Negation 831in the subordinate adverbial clause negation is formed with the Present stem of
the negative verb ei and the corresponding form of the verb bi- (1742).(1739) a.   Na:           xu-ni            anci     bi-si-ni         min-zur/e

"
18.1.2.2.2. Negative possessive modifierA negative possessive modifier is typically expressed in a coordinated structure
by means of the Partitive forms (on them see 4.3.2). In (1342) the second
clause p'a:-la anci 'there are no windows' refers to the element of the first
clause zugdi 'house'. Although no anaphoric means indicates this reference, it
is conceptually clear and can be rendered by a noun phrase within a single
clause as 'a house without windows.' In (1342b) in a similar situation the
personal marker refers to the element of the first clause: zawaijku-ni anci,
literally 'there is no its handle', where 'its' anaphorically refers to the element
of the first conjoined clause mulexi 'bucket'. In (1342c) there are two
coordinated negative possessive modifiers.(1342) a.   Nua-ni       ijua-ini           zugdi-du
            he-3SG       sleep-3SG          house-DAT

18.1.2.3. Conjoined embedded clausesEmbedded clauses are conjoined by means of juxtaposition (1343a) or by
repetition of the main clause (1343b).(1343) a.   Maqga        edi-ne-li:-si-ni                  mo:

            'They saw that their elder brother was tied down and that they had
            tied him to the tent.' (SKX 252)
18.1.3. Conjunction under the scope of negationConstituents within one clause cannot be conjoined under the scope of
negation, so the meaning 'neither ... nor' is always conveyed by a biclausal
structure: (a + b)C —» aC + bC where C is negation and a and b are coordinated
constituents. In a sentence they are often followed by the clitic particle -dA
(1344a).(1344) a.   Ni:          xokto-ni-de              anci,   bui

658   Complex sentences18.2. DisjunctionDisjunctive structures are expressed by several particles and conjunctions
glossed as DIS (disjunction). On disjunctive questions see 23.1.4.","[692, 693, 694]"
"(345) Type I             Present
      Type Π             Permissive, Subjunctive
      Type ΙΠ            Perfect, Conditional

      Type V             Past, Past Participle
      Type VI            ImperativeIn a verbal form the tense/mood suffix or the marker of a certain non-finite
form normally follows the stem immediately. Personal inflections usually
occupy the rightmost position in the word, that is, they follow these affixes.
The only exception is the 3rd person inflection -du- in the Π and the ΙΠ
paradigmatic types which immediately follows the verbal stem and therefore
precedes the tense/mood marker, or the marker of the non-finite form, for
example, etete-du-ze 'let them work' <work-PL-SUBJ>. Moreover, for class I
verbs ending in -i or -u whose Perfect stem is derived by the element -ge-, the
3rd Plural inflection -du- precedes this element -ge-. For example: umi-du-ge
'they have drunk' <drink-PL-PERF>.
   Sometimes the 3rd person Singular inflection is absent in the Future: bi-zeije
'he will be' <be-FUT> (SK 1107), e-zerje b 'a-gi 'will not find again' <NEG-
FUT find-REP>.
214 Verbal morphology7.3. Negative conjugationThe negative conjugation is periphrastic and can be formed in two alternative
ways. First, most verbal categories are negated with the negative auxiliary verb
e(i)- (7.1.4) in the corresponding temporal/aspectual/modal form followed by a
bare Present stem of the matrix verb (see also 23.2). The negative verb e-
appears in a morphological form that reflects the role of the predicate in the
sentence. Secondly, for other categories the negative construction has three
components: the negative verb in a certain form + the bare verbal stem + the
copula verb 'be' in a corresponding tense. These two types do not duplicate the
opposition synthetic/analytic.
   The content verb appears as a bare stem or as a stem augmented by
derivational affixes. It may also take the suffixes -du- in the Plural or the bound
Plural word getu, although, like all other Plural markers, they are not
obligatory. The stems of the negative verb are presented in (7.1.4) and its
conjugation is exemplified in 7.3.
   The examples below illustrate the different forms of the content verb in
negative sentences: class I verbs (346), class Π verbs for which the n-final stem
appears in the epenthesized form (347), and stems augmented by the Plural affix
-du (348).(346) a.    Bi ei-mi            sa:.
            me NEG-1SG          know

            'The dog is not walking.'","[247, 248]"
"
23.2.1.4. Negation of stateThe stative negative construction is formed analytically with the copular verb
bi- in the corresponding personal form and the content verb: a stem followed
by the contrastive clitic particle -gdA (12.1.1.8).

"
23.2.1.5.2. Negation of habitual constructionsCopular constructions with the habitual meaning (17.1.2.2) are negated with
the uninflected Present stem of the negative verb ei in combination with the
Habitual form of the verb 'be' bie. This type of negation applies to adjectival or
nominal constructions with a habitual or generic meaning (1714) including
subjectless constructions (1715), as well as to destinative participial
constructions (1716), and constructions of alienable possession (1717).(1714) a.   Ei mo:        gugda ei         bie.

23.1.4.1. Alternative questions with the pro-verbThe alternative question can be formed with the pro-verb ja- as the second
disjunct. The pro-verb takes the same morphological form as the finite verb in
the first disjunct: in (1681a) they are both in the 2nd person Singular Future, in
(1681b) in the 3rd person Singular Present. This type is used when the
alternatives are described by the same verb in a positive and a negative form.

"
7.6.1.3. Destinative ParticiplesDestinative Participles can be formed from virtually all verbs with the possible
exception of the null-place verbs discussed in 14.1.1. They have personal and
impersonal forms and are derived with the suffix -kci added to the Present
verbal stem (which is followed by the epenthetic vowel for class Π verbs). Case
inflection occurs in the same way as with nouns and is therefore not illustrated
in section 7.6. Destinative Participles cannot be pluralized. Examples:(380) class I verbs                               class Π verbs
      jexe-kci           'meant for singing'      dian-a-kci 'meant for saying'
       bu-kci            'meant for giving'
       umi-kci           'meant for drinking'   The negative auxiliary verb does not have a Destinative Participle.
Destinative Participles are negated with the help of a periphrastic construction
(see section 23.2 ""Negation"").",[269]
"
7.1.3. Perfect stem7.1.3.1. Class I verbsFor most class I verbs the Perfect stem is formed from the Present stem through
the laryngealization of the stem-final vowel: lai -» l'ai, loi -> l'ol, lei -> Γ el,
läl    Γäl. The final vowels Iii and lui do not laryngealize; the suffix -ge- is
instead attached after them:(341)           Class I verbs

7.1.4. Irregular verbs (auxiliaries)Two verbs exhibit irregular stem formation: the copula bi- 'be' and the
negative auxiliary e(i)-. The Perfect and Past stem for these verbs are formed
with an element s that goes back to the old *-s- (the etymological source of the
pharyngeal Ihl found within the old Past stem marker, see 7.1.2). The stem
types of the irregular verbs are shown below:(343)                             'be'            negative auxiliary
        Present stem              bi-             e-, ei-

        Perfectstem               bi-s'e-          e-s'e-For the negative verb the Present stem has two variations, ei- and e-. The stem
ei- is used in some personal forms of the Present tense, and in the Infinitive.
The element -/- here goes back to the regular Present tense marker also found
in the 3rd person Present tense verbal inflection (7.2) and Present active
participles (7.6.1.1.1). The stem e- is used for other forms that are based on the
Present stem, and also for some Present tense personal forms (namely the 2nd
Plural, the 3rd person, and the 1st Plural Exclusive).
   Both auxiliary verbs also exhibit, in several other categories, stem patterns
that are irregular. The verb bi- has the irregular Present Habitual bie (7.3.2.3).
The form bie also functions as the stem that co-occurs with the negative
auxiliary. The negative verb exhibits the irregular stem ata- in the Permissive
and Subjunctive and the irregular Imperative (7.5.1). The irregular forms will
be cited below when discussing the formation of inflectional categories.
212     Verbal morphology   It should be noticed that in the past the copula bi- could have a second stem
be-. This can still be seen in the obsolete form be-s'e (Perfect) (SΚ 1091) and
may be historically related to the postposition bede 'like'.
   The negative copula anci is employed in negative constructions, mostly for
existential negation (see Chapter 23) and is a component of several verbal
compounds (8.3.3). It has the following temporal forms: anci for Present, anci
bi-s'e or anci bi-si-ni for Past, anci bi-zeqe-ni for Future, anci bi-ze for
Subjunctive. In some contexts (23.2.2.2.3) it can take personal affixes;
otherwise it does not express subject agreement. On its case forms see 4.3.2
and 23.2.2.2.3.","[244, 245, 246]"
"The examples below demonstrate the negative Partitive forms in the function of
a secondary predicate. The negative copula either takes the Instrumental form
(208) or remains morphologically unmarked (209), cf. 19.6.2.",[180]
"(477) Eme-gi-se-mi-de                    ei      eme-gi.
      come-REP-EXP-INF-FOC               NEG come-REF
      'He had to return but he didn't return.' (SKX 328)   Some of the verbal derivational affixes are very frequent and productive; the
lists of verbs provided for each case in this section are not intended to be
exhaustive. Yet, verbal derivation is typically restricted to a certain subset of
verbal stems. Therefore, for example, the Passive, which is formed only from
transitives (8.2.1.5), is regarded as an instance of verbal derivation and not as
an inflectional category. Furthermore, unlike inflectional categories, verbal
derivation can alter the argument structure of the initial verb. This criterion
classifies, for example, the absolutely productive Causative suffix -wAn-,
compatible with virtually every verb (8.2.1.2), as a derivational suffix. A
formal criterion that allows us to distinguish between derivational and
inflectional verbal affixes in Udihe is negation. Unlike inflectional morphemes,
derivational suffixes are preserved in the bare stem of the content verb in the
negative conjugation (23.2). The negative auxiliary verb does not take
derivational affixes, with the exception of the Passive. The examples below
288 Verbal derivationpresent the Reciprocal (478), the Causative (479), the Decausative (480), and
the Repetitive (481).","[321, 322]"
"  Besides this, the negative possessive construction with the copula anci can
be conjoint to the clause; such cases are addressed in 18.1.2.2.2.
                         Chapter 24
            Information structure and word order
This chapter deals with the effects of information structuring on the surface
shape of the clause. We assume that the information structure is an independent
level of clause representation that deals with the ""packaging"" of the
information in the utterance. The relevant units of the information structure
here considered as primitives are topic and focus. In their definition we will
rely heavily on the practice of Lambrecht (1994) where they are identified in
relation to one another and to the corresponding proposition. Topic will be
understood as the subject about which the proposition is pragmatically
construed (Lambrecht 1994: 131). The existence of a topic participant is
presupposed by the speaker, so topic is always (a part of) the pragmatic
presupposition of the utterance. Focus will be understood as ""the semantic
component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion
differs from the presupposition"" (Lambrecht 1994: 213). If the presupposition
is lacking, the focus and the assertive part of the utterance coincide. Thus,
every sentence has a focus, but not every sentence necessarily has a topic (if it
lacks a pragmatic presupposition). Roughly speaking, sentence elements that
do not correspond to the functions of topic and focus may be viewed as neutral
with respect to information structure.
   Although, strictly speaking, the notions ""topic"" and ""focus"" refer to relations
at the level of information structure, we will use these terms to refer to the
corresponding elements of the clause as well. Topic normally corresponds to a
non-verbal constituent whose referent is mentioned in the discourse, although
new topics are possible as well. As distinct from the topic, focus can
correspond not only to the nominal constituent, but to a verbal constituent as
well.
   We will further assume that information structure functions stand in a certain
mapping relationship to syntactic and semantic units. However, this is a matter
of considerable controversy, and no attempt will be made to describe here such
mapping relationships in Udihe. This chapter only concentrates on the
correspondences between a particular information structure status and the
linear order of the sentence elements. As demonstrated below, word order in
Udihe is primarily motivated by information structure considerations, although
grammatical information is also relevant.
   Section 24.1 deals with word order at a clause level. Additional information
about word order can also be found in other chapters, particularly those on
840 Information structure and word orderquestions and negation (Chapter 23), on the adverbs (10.1.7), and the particles
(Chapter 12). Word order within a regular NP is treated in Chapter 13.
   In some cases the information structure, together with semantics, conditions
the sentence construction, that is, the encoding of semantic units by
grammatical relations. Some remarks on this may be found in Chapter 16 on
the valence-changing operations. Such alternative constructions at the level of
the clause were discussed in Chapter 16. In section 24.2 we address the word
order and information structure driven alternative encoding of sentence
elements within a noun phrase, while in 24.3 we focus on copular
constructions.","[874, 875, 876]"
"In the Present tense copular relative clause the content verb 'be' co-occurs with
the negative verb in the form of either a regular Present Participle bi:(~) or the
Habitual form bie. The former is normally found within the internal relative
clause (19.2) in which the relative clause predicate (participle) follows the
relativized noun and is marked by case and personal markers. Examples
(1733)—(1735) show that the case suffix is either added to the bare participle form
(examples (a)) or to the negative auxiliary participle (examples (b)).(1733) a. Bi ei-mi             aju     ni:       elu       e-iti

23.2.2.2.2. Negation of the temporal adjunctA temporal adjunct which is normally encoded by the Dative noun phrase
(15.4.2.1) is negated with the Dative case of the negative copula inflected with

"
23.2.1.6. Subordinate clauseNegation in the subordinate clause is formally organized in the same way as in
the main clause, that is, with the negative verb in the corresponding
morphological form and the bare stem of the content verb. In the following
examples the subordinate clause is marked with square brackets in the glosses.",[863]
"
7.3.2.3. Irregular verbsThe copula verb bi- 'be' has special Habitual non-analytic impersonal forms in
the Present and the Past. In the Present it has a special impersonal form bie
'there is/there are', which does not take agreement affixes. This form functions
as an independent verb in some copular constructions (Chapter 17). It is also
found within analytic verbal forms, where it substitutes for the regular
(non-Habitual) Present tense of the verb 'be', for example, in the analytic
Present Progressive (7.4.3), or Present Habitual (7.4.2.1). The Past Habitual of
the verb 'be' is the impersonal form bi-s'e or bie bi-s'e 'used to be', while the
220   Verbal morphologyFuture Habitual has regular forms inflected for person and number such as bie
bi-zerje-ni 'he will usually be' <be.PRP be-FUT-3SG>, etc. The form bi-s'e is
in fact the bare Perfect stem of the verb 'be' (8.1.4), but it seems that for the
Habitual copula the Past and the Perfect are neutralized: the form (bie) bi-s'e
simply expresses past tense reference in the Habitual aspect.
   In the negative conjugation in the Present tense the Negative stem ei (which
in fact coincides with the Present Participle of the negative verb) is followed by
the bare stem of the content verb: ei erne 'he does not usually come' <NEG
come>, ei tjene-du 'they do not usually go' <NEG go-PL>. In the Past and
Future the negative verb ei is followed by the verbal stem and the Past (or
Perfect) and the Future form, correspondingly, of the verb 'be': ei wakca
bi-si-mi Ί did not usually hunt' <NEG hunt be-PAST-lSG>, ei wakca bi-zeye-i
Ί will not usually hunt' <NEG hunt be-FUT-lSG>. An example of the
negative Past Habitual follows:(360) Anana            udie     oño-mi          ei      noni       bi-s'e,
      long.ago          Udihe write-INF         NEG can            be-PERF
      tayi-mi-de       ei      ñoñi     bi-s'e.
      read-INF-FOC NEG can              be-PERF
      'Earlier the Udihe could neither write nor read.'","[253, 254]"
"Like adjectives, the negative Partitive forms may be postnominal (206) or
discontinuous with their head (207). In both cases the negative copula takes a
case inflection that indicates the role of the head noun in the clause.",[180]
"
23.2.2. Constituent negationConstituent negation does not differ in a formal respect from sentence negation.
When a constituent is negated but the contrasting alternative is not overtly
expressed, the clause is interpreted as sentence negation. Constituent negation
becomes apparent only in the situation of overt contrast, when the negated
constituent is formally opposed to another semantically similar element
(23.2.2.1). Only for some constituents is negation expressed by some
specialized sentence constructions (23.2.2.2).",[870]
"Proprietive forms are negated in an irregular fashion by means of the Partitive
negative construction as in (1263). For further information see 23.2.1.5.4.",[663]
"
12.2.1.5. Affectionate addressIn folklore tales and songs the word bajani or its expressive variant baja-nie (<
baja-ni <dear-3SG>) can be used after the address itself. It goes back to the

-ni. This word is approximately translated as '(my) dear'.(919) a.    rjua-je              qua-je                   xudasi:          ni:

"  As in the case of Destinative Participles, the negative auxiliary verb does not
have Resultati ve Participle forms. To negate Resultati ve Participles a
periphrastic construction is used (see 23.2.1.5.3).",[270]
"Existential and possessive copular constructions with the copula ede- 'become'
are negated with the negative copula anci (often with the focus particle -gdA)
and the verb ede- in the corresponding form. The resulting meaning is 'remain
without', 'disappear'.(1713) a.   Eitene       dawa o-du              anci     ede:-ni.

"
23.2.1.5.1. Negation of existential and possessive constructionsExistential (17.2.1.3) and possessive (17.2.1.4) constructions, which require the
Habitual impersonal copula bie in declarative sentences, are negated with the
impersonal existential negation anci 'there is no, there are no' in various
temporal forms (see 7.1.4). The existential meaning is shown in (1709) for the
Present tense, in (1710) for the Past tense, and in (1711) for the Subjunctive.
The negative possessive construction is shown in (1712).(1709) a.   O-du         tue     ima: anci.

7.4.1.4. FutureFuture forms are derived from the Present stem with the future suffix -ζΑηΑ-
followed by IV type inflections. Class Π verbs have an optional epenthetic
vowel     after the stem in the Future. Examples:                   ljua-zeqe-fi
<sleep-FUT-1 PL.IN>, dian-(a)-zaya-fi <say-0-FUT-lPL.IN> 'we (IN) will
sleep, say'. The negative forms include the Future of the negative verb and the
bare present stem of the content verb: e-zetje-fì ijua 'we (IN) won't sleep'
<NEG-FUT-1PL.IN sleep>.
                                Formation of the Indicative tense/aspect forms   2177.4.1.5. PluperfectThe Pluperfect is the only analytic tense in the General aspect Indicative. It is
formed with the Past Participle of the content verb followed by the copula bi-
(on the formation of the personal and impersonal Past Participles see 7.5.1.1.2).
The Pluperfect may be formed in three different formal ways, which are in free
variation and do not exhibit any apparent difference in meaning:
   (i) impersonal Past Participle + copula in the Past(352) umi-e bi-si-mi             Ί had drunk'     <drink-PP be-PAST-lSG>
      diaij-ka bi-si-ni          'he had said'    <say-PP be-PAST-3SG>
      camna: bi-si-mi            Ί had broken'    <break.PP be-PAST-lSG>  (ii) impersonal Past Participle + copula in the Perfect(353) umi-e bi-s'e-i             Ί had drunk'     <drink-PP be-PERF-lSG>
      diarj-ka bi-s 'e           'he had said'    <say-PAST be-PERF>  (iii) personal Past Participle + copula in the 3rd person Perfect(354) koijko:-i bi-s'e           Ί had broken'    <break.PP-lSG be-PERF>
      koqko:-ni bi-s 'e          'he had broken' <break.PP-3SG be-PERF>
      korjko:-ti bi-s 'e         'they had broken'<break.PP-3PL be-PERF>Thus, personal inflections attach either to the copula (in the Past or Perfect) or
to the content verb (Past Participle). The 3rd person (uninflected) Perfect copula
that remains unchanged for the whole paradigm is also attested for other
analytic forms (see 7.3.2 and 7.3.3).
   In the negative conjugation, the negative verb is in the Past or Perfect, and
the content verb has the form of the Past Participle: e-si-mi korjko: Ί hadn't
broken' <NEG-PAST-1SG break.PP>, e-s'e-i diaij-ka 'you (SG) hadn't said'
<NEG-PERF-2SG say-PP>, e-s'e-i ise: Ί hadn't seen' <NEG-PERF-1 SG
see.PP>, etc. The copula 'be', therefore, is replaced by the negative auxiliary.","[250, 251]"
"
7.4.3.3. Negative formsProgressive forms are negated by the Infinitive of the negative verb followed
by the verbal stem and the corresponding temporal form of the copula 'be',
which is null in the Present tense, for example: bi ei-mi umi Ί am not
drinking', ei-mi umi bi-si-mi Ί was not drinking' <NEG-1SG drink
be-PAST-lSG>, ei-mi umi bi-zeqe-i Ί will not be drinking' <NEG-1SG drink
be-FUT-lSG>.",[255]
"Non-finite verbal forms have an internally fixed tense/aspect/mood structure.
Most of them are specialized in conveying a particular temporal and/or modal
meaning, and all of them are easily compatible with aspectual (Aktionsart) and
226   Verbal morphology
valence-changing affixes, subject to the usual semantic restrictions (on them
see Chapter 8), for example:(370) a.    Ise-we-je                     gakpa-si-u-we.
            see-CAUS-IMP.2SG             shoot-IM-PAS.PRP-ACC
            'Show how one should shoot.' (SK 390)
       b.   Ni:        sugzä-wa          nagda-li:       zuleixi tukä:-iti.
            man       fish-ACC           get-INC.PRP forward run-3PL
            'Those who struck the fish run forward.' (SK 337)Certain non-finite forms have passive variants.
   Udihe non-finite verb forms fall into three major classes on the basis of the
inflectional categories they can express and the syntactic type of the
subordinate clause in which they function: (i) participles; (ii) converbs; and (iii)
infinitives. Participles express the relative clause, the complement clause, and
sometimes, in combination with certain case suffixes or postpositions, the
adverbial clause. Converbs prototypically express adverbial clauses of various
semantics (and also, in some special cases, the complement clause). Infinitives
form the complement clause or the adverbial clause of manner (for further
details see section 7.10).
   The following morpho-semantic subclasses of non-finite verb forms are
further distinguished: for participles - active, passive, Resultative, and
Destinati ve participles; for converbs - Purposive con verb, Imperfective
converb, Perfective converb, and Conditional converbs (including Realis
Conditional converb, Irrealis Conditional converb for the Present and the Past
and Necessitative Conditional converb); for Infinitives - Infinitive and
Impersonal Infinitive. Infinitives are morphologically invariable. Participles, as
opposed to converbs and infinitives, take a case inflection. Active participles in
certain syntactic functions and most converbs take personal agreement
morphemes which indicate the person and the number of the subject of the
embedded clause. Such forms will be called personal. Impersonal forms of
active participles are only inflected for number. Passive, Destinative, and
Resultative participles do not have personal forms, that is, do not mark the
person and the number of the embedded clause subject.
   Personal forms of active participles and converbs usually encode not only
information about the number and the person of the subordinate clause subject,
but also information about its coreferential relations with the subject of the
superordinate clause (switch-reference). In other words, these forms have
special inflections, which indicate whether or not the subject of the subordinate
clause is coreferential with the subject of the superordinate clause (for the
notion of subject see 15.1.1). When there is coreference we will speak about
same-subject (SS) markers; when there is not we will refer to different-subject
(DS) markers. Different-subject markers are subject agreement markers, and
therefore are distinguished for two numbers and all grammatical persons.
                                                          Non-finite forms 111Same-subject markers have two number forms - Singular and Plural - but do
not vary in person. Some generalizations on the system of switch-reference in
Udihe can be found in 22.5.
   The negative participles, converbs, and infinitives are formed in a regular
way: with the help of the negative auxiliary verb e(i)- which takes all the
corresponding morphological markers and the bare stem of the lexical verb
which follows it, sometimes followed by the copula. Below we will cite for
each particular category the corresponding form of the negative auxiliary verb.
   The following summary table illustrates the system of the Udihe non-finite
verb forms derived from the verbal stem nodo- 'lose' (the table does not
include all personal forms for active participles and converbs, nor all case
forms for participles; they are found in section 7.7).","[259, 260, 261]"
"       Κ   = Kormusin (1998)
       SK  = Simonov and Kjalundzjuga (1998)
       SKX = Simonov, Kjalundzjuga, and Xasanova (1998-1999)The materials of the Northern dialect are cited using a phonological
transcription. This differs from the transcription originally used in the sources,
which was partly phonetic and in most cases employed the Cyrillic alphabet.
   Sentence examples are provided in phonological transcription with morpheme-
by-morpheme glosses and functionally equivalent English translations. Words in
the translations that are absent in the example are bracketed, except for personal
pronouns. For the sake of economy, the personal pronouns, which are not marked
for gender in Udihe, are all translated as 'he'. In the glosses the 1st person personal
pronoun is indicated as 'me'. Russian proper names, and other terms that remain
untranslated, are cited in the international transliteration system, while local
vili Prefacenames are transliterated into English as they are found in English-language
geographical reference books. For polysemantic Udihe words the glosses give the
meaning appropriate to the given context, so the same word may be glossed in
several ways. For example, the Udihe word egdi may be glossed either as 'many'
or as 'much', and the postposition edeisini may be glossed either as 'if or 'when',
depending on the context.
   Morphemes are separated with hyphens in both the Udihe text and the glosses.
Stems are glossed by English lexical words, while other morphemes are glossed
with abbreviations of category labels. When more than one English word is
required to translate a Udihe word, they are linked by a period. The grammatical
category that is not expressed by means of a separate morpheme is not reflected in
the glosses, partly for reasons of economy, and partly because the decision on the
presence or absence of the morphological null may sometimes be controversial.
However, when two separate morphs are contracted to one for phonological
reasons, this is indicated by a period in the glosses. Thus in the following
examples convention (a) will be used instead of (b), or (c).(a)    Sagdä-rji-mi     mo:      bede     ute-ne:-mi ( *— utene-e-mi).
       old-V-INF        tree     like     rotten.tree-V.PAST-lSG
       Ί grew decrepit like an old tree.'
(b)    Sagdä-qi-mi      mo:               bede     ute-ne:-mi.
       old-V-INF        tree:NOM:SG like           rotten.tree-V:PAST-lSG
(c)    Sagdä-iji-mi     mo:-0             bede     ute-ne:-mi.
       old-V-INF        tree-NOM:SG like           rotten.tree-V:PAST-lSGThe period is also used for those few ""portmanteau"" morphs that do not result
from phonological contraction at the synchronic level, for example, -li
<CC.SS> (Conditional converb, same-subject), and -lie <CC.SS.PL>
(Conditional Converb, same-subject, Plural).
  Examples that only make up a fragment of a sentence are glossed in arrow
brackets. In the translations of some examples we have included a grammatical
specification of the meaning in round brackets. This is not intended as a gloss,
but rather to facilitate understanding of the translation, for example:       zugdi-tigi        'to the house (LAT)' or <house-LAT>Unlike nominal stems, bare verbal stems are cited with a hyphen, for example
zìi:- 'saw' (a verb) versus zü: 'saw' (a noun). Embedded clauses are indicated
by square brackets.
   The grammar is intended to be a more or less comprehensive description. It
follows the traditional structure: general introduction - phonology -
morphology - syntax - texts - vocabulary - indexes. Much use is made of
cross-references between the various chapters and sections. The morphological
description is organized around inflectional and derivational forms. The
                                                                     Preface   ix
functions of some of these may be addressed in separate sections within the
corresponding chapters. The syntactic part is mostly organized around various
syntactic units such as, for example, the noun phrase, relative clause, adverbial
clause and so on, but in some cases we also follow the function-to-form
approach.
    The grammar is not biased towards any particular theoretical framework,
although in several cases we choose to explain within the text the basis of the
notions used in the description. The terminology is intended to be theory-
independent. The names of particular grammatical categories typical of Udihe
are capitalized; adjectives derived from these, as well as general grammatical
and semantic notions, are in lower case, for example, ""Possessive suffix"" (the
suffix of the grammatical category Possessive) and ""possessive construction"",
""possessive form"", and ""possessive meaning"".

                              Introduction
1.1. The Udihe language and its genetic affiliationUdihe (other spellings used are Udehe, Udegej, Udege, Udeghe, Udige,
Udighe, LJde) is a Tungus language spoken as a first language by
approximately 100 people, all over 50 years old, in the southern part of the
Russian Far East (see 1.2.3 for more information on the number of speakers
and 1.2.4 on its geographical location). Udihe is divided into two dialects each
with several local variants (1.3). Despite a lack of official status or written
tradition, several attempts have been made to create a writing system for use in
schools (1.6.2, 1.6.3).
   The Tungus (Tungus-Manchu) language family is widely assumed to be a
branch of Altaic. The scheme in (1) represents the classification of the Tungus
languages as accepted in Vasilevic (1960) and Sunik (1962: 16-20, 1968: 54,
1997: 154). The alternative classifications either group together the Manchu
and Southern Tungus languages (Cincius 1949; Benzing 1955: 9-10; Menges
1978: 370; Comrie 1981: 58) or treat Northern Tungus, Southern Tungus, and
Manchu as three independent branches (Avrorin 1959-1961). On some other
classifications and/or comparisons between them see Menges (1968: 25-30),
Ikegami (1974), Doerfer (1978), Vovin (1993), and Miller (1994).","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]"

Casting light on the interplay bet-         which aim at explaining how lang-
ween language and domain-specific           uage works, and how people combi-
knowledge, this new book brings             ne their knowledge from a variety of
together ideas and approaches from          sources as they make sense of and
cognitive linguistics and psychology        draw inferences from text.","[999, 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006]"

7.4.1.2. PastLikewise, the Past tense is not indicated by a special suffix. It is formed from
the Past stem by attaching type I personal inflections.(350) wakca:-i            'you hunted'     <hunt.PAST-2SG>
      wakca:-fi           'we hunted'      <hunt.PAST-lPL.IN>
      diaij-ki:           'you said'       <say.PAST-2SG>
      diarj-ki-fi         'we said'        <say.PAST-lPL.IN>Class Π verbs may also have alternative forms appearing as a result of analogy
with class I verbs: diana:-ni 'he said' <say.PAST-3SG> (-a- is an epenthetic
216   Verbal morphologyvowel that was reinterpreted as part of the stem and lengthened in the Past, like
the stem-final vowels of the class I verbs).
   In the negative conjugation a negative verb in the Past is followed by the
bare Present tense stem of the content verb: e-si-mi wakca, dian-a
<NEG-PAST-1SG hunt, say> Ί didn't hunt, say', e-si-u wakca, dian-a
<NEG-PAST-2PL hunt, say> 'you didn't hunt, say', etc.","[249, 250]"
"
7.5.5. PermissiveThe Permissive is based on the Present stem, and has the suffix -tA- and type Π
personal inflections. For class Π verbs an optional epenthetic vowel may be
present.(368) yene-te-mi           Ί will perhaps go'
      <go-PERM-1 SG>
      zima-ta-u            'we will visit (you) sometime'
      <visit-PERM-1 PL.EX>
                                                             Non-finite forms   225
       bu-te-u              'we (EX) will perhaps give'
       <give-PERM-1 PL.EX>
       diga-ta              'he may eat'
       <eat-PERM>
       dian-(a)-ta-u        'we will perhaps say'
       <say-0-PERM-1 PL.EX>
       dian-(a)-ta-mi       Ί will perhaps say'
       <say-0-PERM-1 SG>Permissive forms are almost always followed by the hortative clitic particle -zA
(see examples in section 7.9.5).
   The negative verb in this mood has the non-standard stem ata- which is
followed by type Π personal inflections and the bare Present stem of the
content verb: ata-mi mute Ί won't be able perhaps' <NEG.PERM-1SG can>.
So, for the negative verb the Permissive and Subjunctive (7.5.2) are
neutralized. The verb 'be' behaves like a regular verb in the Permissive, for
example: bi-te-ze 'it will perhaps be' <be-PERM-HORT>.","[258, 259]"
"
7.6.1.1.1. Present active participlesPresent active participles are derived from the Present stem with the suffix -i.
For class Π verbs this suffix follows the epenthetic vowel -A-. For class I i-final
stems the participle suffix -i- is contracted with the stem final vowel into -/:.
Impersonal Singular forms coincide with the bare participle form: wakca-i
'hunting' <hunt-PRP>, dian-a-i 'saying' <say-0-PRP>. In the Plural the
impersonal forms take the Plural word getu, or - more rarely - -du-: wakca-i
getu 'hunting (PL)' <hunt-PRP PL>, dian-a-i-getu                    'saying (PL)'
<say-0-PRP-PL>. The negative auxiliary impersonal form is ei. An example of
the participle in the negative form is: ei jexe 'not singing (SG)', ei jexe getu
'not singing (PL)' <NEG.PRP sing PL>, ei noni getu 'not being able (PL)'
<NEG.PRP can-PL>, ei soijo-du 'not crying (PL)' <NEG.PRP cry-PL>.
   For personal forms different-subject affixes coincide with regular possessive
suffixes (or type IV inflectional affixes, see 7.2), for example: wakca-i-ni
'hunting       (3SG)'      <hunt-PRP-3SG>,      wakca-i-ti      'hunting    (3PL)'
<hunt-PRP-3PL>, etc. In the Nominative for the Is1 and 2nd persons the
personal affix is contracted with the Participle marker: i [unstressed] + i —> i,
for example: wakca-i 'hunting (1SG, 2SG)' (< wakca-i-i <hunt-PRP-lSG,
2SG>). In the 2nd Plural and 1st Plural Exclusive the participle suffix -i- is
missing, probably for the same phonetic reasons (i + u —» u): wakca-u 'hunting
(2PL, 1PL EX)' (< wakca-i-u <hunt-PRP-2PL, 1PL.EX>). In the function of
the same-subject affixes, the reflexive possessive affixes are used: -i (truncated
in the Nominative) for the Singular and -fi for the Plural. Examples: wakca-i
'hunting' <hunt-PRP.SS>, wakca-i-fi 'hunting' <hunt-PRP-SS.PL>.
   Personal forms always inflect for case. The case suffix follows the participle
affix -i- and precedes the personal affix. Case affixes are the same as for the
class I nouns (see 4.1.3) except that in the Dative case two suffixes are found,
-di- and -du-. In fact, -di is an assimilated variant of -du. It appears when the
personal inflection that follows it contains the vowel Iii (cf. 2.1.4.2). Thus, the
affix -di is found in all personal forms except for the 1st person Plural Exclusive
and 2nd person Plural, which contain the vowel lui and therefore do not
assimilate the Dative suffix. The regular morphonological contraction takes
place in the course of case inflection on the boundary of the case morpheme
and the personal inflection (2.3.1), for example: wakca-i-digi <— wakca-i-digi-i
230    Verbal morphology<hunt-PRP-ABL-lSG> Ί am hunting (ABL)'. For the same-subject participles
the Accusative forms are homonymous with the Nominative forms. The
illustrative case paradigms are presented in 7.7.
   In negative personal forms personal inflections attach to the Present
Participle of the negative verb: e-i-mi 1SG, etc. However, the behavior of the
negative forms with respect to the case affix is flexible in the sense that in the
syntactic positions that normally require case marking for the participle, the
negative verb often does not take the case marker. The case marker then
remains on the verbal stem. Compare, for example, (372a) where the negative
auxiliary has the case suffix (Accusative) marking the semantic role of the
relativized noun, and (372b) where the case suffix (Instrumental) is added to
the verbal stem and not to the auxiliary.(372) a.    Bi sa:-mi            gugda mo:    ei-we-ni
            me know-lSG          tall    tree NEG.PRP-ACC-3SG
            bie.
            be.PRES.HAB
            Ί know a tree which is not tall.'
       b.   Pakula      diasi-e-ni            gabzi ni:      ei
            Pakula      speak-PAST-3SG        happy man      NEG.PRP
            bie-zi.
            be.PRES.HAB-INST
            'Pakula was speaking with a man who was not happy.'","[263, 264]"
"
7.6.3.1. InfinitiveThe marker of this Infinitive is -mi. Examples:(387) Class I                              Class Π
      jexe-mi                'sing'        dian-a-mi         'say'
      bu-mi                  'give'
       umi-mi                'drink'Class Π verbs occasionally have the stem-final Ini consonant dropped before
the Infinitive affix; obviously the epenthetic vowel is not present in this case,
for example: kepte-we-mi 'make somebody lie' <lie-CAUS-INF>.
   As is usual with the final Iii, the final vowel in the Infinitive suffix can often
either be truncated or changed into ie, so forms such as diga-m ~ diga-mie ~
diga-mi 'eat' are variants that depend on the pronunciation style, the intonation,
and the emphasis within the sentence (see also 2.1.5).
   The negative Infinitive is formed from the negative auxiliary Present stem
ei- by adding the Infinitive marker, for example: ei-mi jexe 'not to sing'
<NEG-ENF sing>.",[275]
"  Verbs easily undergo ellipsis under negation, when the content verb is omitted
and the negative verb alone bears the predicative function.(1589) a.   Si eme-zeqe-i?                 E-zeqe-i.
            you come-FUT-2SG               NEG-FUT-1SG
            'Will you come? I won't.'
       b.   Safani:,     e-zetje-i,                oijmo:-mi.
            boring       NEG-FUT-1SG               forget.PAST-lSG
            'Enough, I won't (tell), I forgot.'
       c.   Ε-ζβηβ-i,             guq-ki-ni.
            NEG-FUT-1SG           say-PAST-3SG
            Ί won't, he said.'(SKX 164)
22.3. ReflexivizationFormally, reflexivization is expressed by means of the Reflexive pronoun men-
(9.2) or Reflexive Possessive affixes (4.1.4.2). Examples of these two cases are
presented in sections 22.3.1.1 and 22.3.1.2 respectively. The ordinary personal
pronouns and possessive affixes are not used in the reflexive function. There
are no specialized verbal reflexive affixes. Reflexive markers indicate that the
corresponding element is coreferential with another element, its antecedent.
This element is unambiguously identified as the subject (cf. 15.1.1). The
syntactic conditions on reflexivization are addressed in more detail in sections
22.3.2 and 22.3.3.
ΠΑ Coreference22.3.1. Reflexive elements22.3.1.1. Reflexive pronounsAs mentioned in 9.2, Reflexive pronouns have Singular and Plural forms.
Below we illustrate Reflexive pronouns in argument and adverbial positions in
the Accusative (1590), the Locative (1591), the Instrumental (1592), and the
Destinative (1593).(1590) a.   Ei ñ'aula me-mui             men-e             mäunda-zi:
            this guy     REF-ACC          REF-0            gun-INST.REF
            wa:-ni.
            kill.PAST-3SG
            'This guy killed himself with his own gun.'
       b.   Bue-ni       me-mui          ei-ni             aju.
            he-3SG       REF-ACC          NEG-3SG          like
            'He does not like himself.'
       c.   Nua-ti       mefei           ei-ti             aju.
            he-3PL       REF.ACC.PL NEG-3PL                like
            'They don't like themselves.'","[809, 810]"

23.2.1.5.5. Desiderative constructionThe desiderative copular construction (17.2.3.2) is negated by the uninflected
Present stem of the negative verb ei, which precedes the Desiderative noun.
This is illustrated in (1728), while (1729) shows the same construction with the
copula ede- 'become'.
                                                               Negation 827(1728) a.   Ei-de        diga-mugdi.
            NEG-FOC eat-DESN
            'He does not want to eat.'
       b.   Eitene      ei-de            diga-mugdi.
            now         NEG-FOC          eat-DESN
            'Now I don't want to eat.'(1729) a.   Ei-de        umi-mugdi         ede:-ni.
            NEG-FOC drink-DESN            become.PAST-3SG
            'He stopped feeling thirsty.'
       b.   W'atarji     nua-ni           diga-mugdi      bi-si-ni,
            before       he-3SG           eat-DESN        be-PAST-3SG

            now          NEG-FOC          eat-DESI        become.PAST-3SG
            'Previously he wanted to eat, now he has stopped wanting to.'","[862, 863]"
