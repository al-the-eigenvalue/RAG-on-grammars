These words are adverbs or nouns, used just like any other members ofthese classes.         —      non-verbal:   this   is the case of negation       by means   of the particles _ta(ike)‘negative’ and _wa(a) ‘negative existential’ (cf. 9.1.4), which take the preceding phrase astheir ‘scope’;         — verbal: this is the case of negative clauses built around the negative verbal form(cf. 5.4.3.1.3);         — polar:      this is the case of the negative sentence-equivalent particle owa               ‘no,nothing, nobody’ (cf. 9.2.1).",[577]

10.3.5.1. Non-verbal negation. In Sec. 9.1.4, a general characterization of the meaningsand   uses     of the negative   particles _ta(ike)   ‘negation’    and _wa(a)    ‘negative   existential’(=‘there isn’t’) was sketched. Briefly, _wa(a) negates existence, and thus can only take

Notice that _ta(ike) can be used forconstituent negation (69i-m).(69a)   pahko_ta ~ pahko_taa_n-ai                  (b)      pahko_wa        ~      pahko_waa_n-ai

        The supine (‘purpose-of-motion’) form of the verb is negated with _ta(ike) (70a),which puts it closer to adverbs (cf. 5.4.3.1.1, 10.4.1.2.2, 10.4.1.3.3). Curiously enough, the

Meira 1998a:120ff, L36ff for a hypothesis on the historical development of the negativeand habitual past forms from the supine). The remote past is also negated with _ta(ike)(70d-e).(70a)      méré_pona      wi-tén         emamina-e_ta

The negative equivalent of a conjugated             (Set D clause is acopular or equative clause built around the negative form of the corresponding verb stem(cf. 5.4.3.1.3): in order to say ‘I don’t kill birds’, Tiriyé speakers use ‘I am birds not-killing’(71a-f). Like the habitual past, the negative form follows a nominative pattern of personmarking, in that the O participant can occur as a person prefix on the negated verb stemwhile the A and S participants must be either noun phrases or person prefixes on the copula
                                                                                               559
 e(i). There is some evidence that a preverbal O noun phrase forms a verb phrase with the verb, but the data are scant (cf. 10.2.2). The optional occurrence of the copula makes the negative clause look structurally different from the habitual past; a further difference is theidiosyncratic third-person O prefix im-, which does not occur on habitual past forms (71b).","[577, 578, 579, 580]"

As was mentioned in 10.4.1, clauses based on a verb in thehabitual    past   (-se;       cf.   5.4.3.1.1)   form   show   a nominative-accusative    pattern   of personmarking (the O participant is marked as a prefix on transitive verbs (68a-d), while the A(68a-d)    and S (68e-h) participants are not marked);                  as usual, adverbs or postpositionalphrases can optionally occur (68a, c, d, f-h). No data on coreference control (cf. 10.4.1) isavailable for the habitual past; presumably, it is controlled by the A/S participants, as innegative clauses (cf. next section). An overt O noun phrase, if present, was obligatorilyplaced before the verb, apparently forming a verb phrase (cf. the placement of the second-position particle _pité ‘a second, temporarily’                 after the verb in (68b)). An explicit   A or Snoun phrase is not distinguished morphologically from an O noun phrase; here, word orderis very important. Most of the examples have a postverbal A/S participant; the few cases inwith a preverbal           A     (68d)   usually had either an O-marking         prefix on the verb,    or anintervening O noun phrase (cf. 10.5).

semantics such as capacity, impossibility, etc. (cf. 4.2.2.2 and 6.2.1.2). Considering that negative clauses are
also copular/equative, one wonders if Tiriy6 should be seen as a language in which the expression of ‘verbal
states’ implies copular/equative predications. Unlike English, in which the suppression of one of the
arguments     suffices   (‘he hunts’,    ‘this book   sells well’),    Tiriy6    seems   to reserve    verbal    predication   for less
‘stative’   situations and copular predication

"             Negation can be of the following kinds:
         — lexical: that is the case of negative adverbializing and nominalizing affixes suchas i- -nna, i- -mi(ni)        ‘not having’, I- -:ra, i- -pi(ni)     ‘having an inefficient N’, etc. (cf.",[577]
"            From the semantic viewpoint, there are certain tantalizing similarities between thetransitive and intransitive verbalizers. All of them concern the relationship between one ofthe participants of the derived verb stem (O or S) and the source noun (N), in a ‘negative’(‘depriving’, ‘ceasing’) or ‘positive’ (‘giving’, ‘having/getting’) manner. If the parallelismswere perfect, one might say that the transitive verbalizers are close to being causativeversions of the intransitive verbalizers: the ‘positive’ beneficiative suffixes -hté/-nté and-pa/-ma      would      describe the action of ‘giving N to O’, while the ‘positive’                               inchoativesuffixes      -ta/-na      (-wa)      and    -pa(mi)/-ma(mi)        would      correspond          to      the     event    of‘producing/getting N’; the              ‘negative’   privative suffix -ka would indicate                    the action of‘taking N away from O’, while the ‘negative’ cessative -ke(pi) would express the idea of‘losing N’, ‘not having N anymore’. There are, however, details which deviate from thisparallelism:     -ke(pi),     for instance,     is much   less productive          on nouns         than     -ka, and itsmeaning       does   not     really    imply   ‘being   deprived’     as    much     as    ‘ceasing         to     function’,‘stopping’; moreover, it is more frequently used with verb stems. In addition, though thedistinction between          -ta/-na    and -pa(mi)/-ma(mi)         roughly     correlates        with   the distinctionbetween -hté/-nté and -pa/-ma (e.g. both -pa/-ma and -pa(mi)/-ma(mi) occur on ‘moreabstract’    noun    roots    like emu(ku)       ‘sadness’,   akunu        ‘laziness’,    etc.,    while         -ta/-na   andhté/-nté occur on ‘more concrete’ roots), the overlap is imperfect at best (e.g. nmuu-ma‘impregnate O’, from nmuku                  ‘son’, corresponds not to *nmuh-pa(mi), but to nmubh-ta,
                                                                                                     270 ‘have, give birth to a son’). Although Table             5.8 still looks   suggestive,   and may    haveconsequences for diachronic studies, it seems that, in present-day Tiriyd, the exact processused to verbalize a noun root is, to a large extent, an idiosyncratic lexical matter.","[290, 291]"
"5.4.3.1.3. Negative forms.            Negative constructions        in Tiriy6 are copular clauses        with      a‘negative    adverbial’    verb   form    (cf.   10.3.5).    The   negative   form    has   a suffix   which     ishistorically derived from -se with the negative particle wa (cf. 8.1.4); the result is a verbalnegative suffix -sewa, which follows, for the first syllable, the allomorphic pattern of the

On transitive stems, the O participant can be marked by means of the O-marking prefixes and the collective suffix -:me (with an exceptional third-person prefix in- [imi- if the stem starts with a consonantcluster (123g)] instead of the expected i-/@-), or it can also be left unmarked (in which casethe verb stem occurs in its back ablaut grade).

          Negative constructions in Tiriyd are copular clauses with the negative verb form asthe predicate.

          ‘T still don’t speak your language.’5.4.3.2. The adverbial forms: -tzuwé ‘Posteriority’, -tékéré ‘Cause’. The two suffixesthat characterize      these forms      are probably       old postpositions    (compare      the final wé      in-tuuwé with the derived locative postpositions in -wé / -o in 7.3.1.2; notice also the classmarker w-, typical of nominalizations,              in (128), which suggests that the verb form wasetymologically @-nominalized and used as the object of a postposition). Synchronically,however, it seems better to treat them as verbal suffixes, for the following reasons:5! The   ‘Actual S’-nominalized   form of ée(pi) also has an unexpected     t-: t-éeh-ke   ‘one who   comes’   (cf.
4.2.2.1.3). This t- is reminiscent of—but not identical with—the t- prefix of t-adding verb stems.

          (b) the alternative of considering -tuuwé and -tékéré as postpositions has problems:they cannot take nominal objects (e.g. *iré-tuuwé ‘after that’ and *iré-tékéré ‘because ofthat’, with the third-person anaphoric             pronoun         iré), and the verb stems occurring with-tuuwé and -tékéré do not seem to be nominalized, since they can reduce, and a possessed@-nominalized verb stem should not be able to reduce on account of the presence of thepossessive suffix -(ri) (compare (129a-b) with (129c), in which a @-nominalized syllable-reducing verb stem remains in its full grade with the Instrumental postposition _ke).(129a) i-ponoh-tuuwé _ ii-ja                                 (b)     i-ponoh-tékéré ii-ja

        The particle _rén(ne)       ‘truly, genuine’    is used with nouns       to indicate that thereferent is a near-prototypical member        of the category:       ‘a real N’, ‘a true, genuine N’

It is, however, more frequently found after verbs (32e), adverbs (32d), and evenpostpositions (32f), indicating that the event is real, or is really going to happen (contraany remaining doubts in the hearer’s mind). With           the directional postposition _pona “to(ward)’, _rén forms the combination _pona_rén,          meaning   ‘until’, ‘as far as’,    ‘even’((32g-h), also (4a); cf. 7.3.1.1.2). Notice the collocation with the particle _pa ‘repetition’(cf. 9.1.3.1),   in (32i-j), where _rén_pa    conveys   the idea of ‘forever’   (or ‘never’,    on anegative verb).

          The    negative particles _wa(a)           and _ta(ike)      are used as a ‘negative           existential’(‘there   isn’t’)      and    a   ‘negative   identificational’     (‘it isn’t’),   respectively      (33a-b).   Thissemantic difference implies that only _ta(ike) can occur after adverbs and postpositionalphrases    (33c-d, f-h). Almost certainly, _wa(a)                 is the source of the negative (-sewa;            cf.5.4.3.1.3)      form    of the      verb   (cf. Meira    1998a:136ff),      and     is certainly    related to thesentence-equivalent particle owa ‘no, nothing nobody’                       (cf. 9.2.1); some of its frequentcollocations seem also to be lexicalizing, such as wa_ken                         ‘there isn’t any’    (33e; noticethe short a), and waa_ri               ‘kill O’, which     is giving      rise to a new      verb     stem aawiri(probably because of a misinterpretation of a first person form, e.g. waa_wi-ri ‘I killedO’ as w-aawiti; cf. (33i-j), and also 5.1.6). The particle _ta(ike) (which occurs in its fullgrade _taike in (33h)) is also probably related to the tahka-particles (cf. 9.1.3.2). Somecases of adverbs negated with _ta(ike) are lexicalizing (cf. (33f), in which kawé_ta ‘nottall’ = ‘short’ can be nominalized with -no [cf. 4.2.2.2]), but this is not generally true (cf.(33g), in which pija_ta ‘not small’ cannot be nominalized). _Taike is also used to negatethe -se forms of the verb,. the supine (33k) and the remote past (331) (but not, of course,the negative form; cf. 5.4.3.1).

           The    particle    _sa(a)   ‘a little’,   ‘a bit’   is used    to   ‘reduce    the   intensity’   of thepredicate (34a-b). It frequently collocates with pija ‘small’, forming pija_sa ‘a little bit’(33c-d), but it can also co-occur with other adverbs (33e-f) and postpositional phrases(33g).(34a) é-jomi         wi-kuu-ja-e_sa                              (b)     kit-ét-ahkéé-ja-e_sa

            The particle ahke(ne) has the meaning         ‘as if’, ‘pretending to be’; it is used tomean that the words within its scope refer to something which is similar to the membersof the category that they normally designate, but is not really a member. A few examplesare given in (35). This particle was compared to _me ‘Attributivizer’ and apo ‘like’ in7.3.4.3.(35a)      mée_n-ai           taréno ahken          (b)          ééseené-to_ta     ahken     kit-a-ti

           ‘This toad has claws, it has something like a jaguar’s claws inside.’
           The particle kahta ‘definitely, without fail’ is used to signify that the event musttake place, at any cost (cf. e.g. French sans faute, Italian senz’altro, Esperanto nepre); it isoften used in ‘desperate’       requests (36a-b). Sometimes           it occurs    with an initial h, forwhich no explanation has been found (36c).

         The remaining particles are not well understood yet. The particle san ~ _sanne(or _saane) follows nouns, apparently with some identificational or presentational flavor(‘here, it’s this one’; cf. (37a-c)); it may be related to the particle _hkaasan ‘instead’ (cf.","[492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497]"
"      A final word to you, the Reader, the ultimate goal of this work. If this grammar,inconclusive though it may be (hence the ‘first’ in the title), still ends up being a source ofvaluable information for you, then my goals will have been fulfilled. If you also happen toenjoy reading it—who knows, this world is full of all kinds of people, including thosewho like Cariban languages—, then I will be happy. For I will think that someone elsehas   managed     to understand   the joy and     satisfaction   that my    forays   into the Tiriyédlanguage have brought me. Etiam homo sum.
to the Tiriy6é people(kurano rén nai ijomiikon),

marker (cf. 5.4.1.1.1); the etymological meaning would be ‘not catching us’ > ‘but’. However, the transitive
stem apé(i) is I-reducing, which means that it should take the -sewa allomorph of the negative suffix. In
fact, ‘not catching us’ is synchronically k-épéé-sewa, not *k-tpé-ewa. If képéewa         is seen as an old
negative form of apé(i), the occurrence of -ewa instead of -sewa remains unexplained.

It is very frequent as the first word                  in a narrative story,occurring subsequently apparently to attract the listener’s attention to a change in topicwhen     the speaker deems       it necessary. It is always followed by a pause (marked by acomma). The English translation ‘well’ is very approximative.

        1. Grammatical particles:        (a) Conjunctions usually occur clause-initially to relate a given sentence to others             in discourse (‘then’, ‘but’, ‘likewise’, etc.; cf. 9.1.1).        (b) Subordinators occur at the end of finite adverbial clauses, marking them as             subordinate (‘when’, ‘if’, ‘because’, etc.; cf. 9.1.2).        (c) Second-position particles, defined by their position after the first syntactic             constituent, fall into three subgroups:              (c-1) Predicational particles, which modify the meaning of the predicate by                        expressing notions such as ‘again’, ‘for a second’, ‘irrealis’ (cf. 9.1.3.1);             (c-2) tahka-, hka- and -ka particles, usually expressing evidential values (cf.",[462]
"       A still (but not so clearly) related meaning of this verb is that of ‘imitating’: taripiwi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate a taripi, a capuchin monkey’, said someone who wasabout to entertain his friends by mimicking a Cebus apella. This can be said about peopleas well: waijana wi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate a Wayana’, and also, waijana i-jomiwi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate the Wayana language’. Interestingly, the Tiriy6é alwaysuse the verb ku(ku) to refer to the capacity of speaking a foreign language; it is as thoughthe only language that one really speaks is one’s own mother tongue, while all the otherlanguages that one might know are ‘imitated’, no matter how well or fluently.

(45d-e)). Owa        is clearly a word, obviously related to the negative particlewa(a); it can also, given the circumstances, mean                ‘nothing’ or ‘nobody’     (45d). Aha,       onthe other hand, looks less stable. Its pronunciation can vary from [aha] to [sho], comingsometimes quite close to the agreeing sound usually spelled as ‘m-m’                        or ‘hm-hm’        inEnglish. Notice also that it is possible to find intensifying particles after owa, but notafter aha (e.g. owa_rén, owa_rén_ken ‘Not at all! Never!’, with _rén(ne) ‘truly, genuine’and _ke(ne) ‘Continuative’, but not *aha_rén or *aha_rén_ken).(45a)    —sen_se              man-a-n ?           (b)    ——€-waaré_w-a-n ?

           ‘Bye!’        Naapohpa is the current expression for ‘thank you’. Several speakers claimed thatit truly meant ‘that’s it’, but usually iré_ré is found in this sense.

Acommon way of ending a story is by saying naka ‘that’s it’, or naka menjaaré ‘that’s itfor now’ (50a). Naka wija ‘enough to me’ can be used to express the idea of satisfactionwith one’s portion (‘no more for me’). It can also be used to talk about the end of anactivity (50b), or about running out of something (50c). In the latter cases, it looks lesslike a sentence equivalent and more like an adverb; however, its lack of class-changingmorphology vouches for its particle status.

        Npa is a hortative particle, meaning ‘let’s go’ (equivalent, in this respect, to thehortative form of té[mi] ‘go’, which is kiténne ‘let’s go’). It is most frequently used byitself, but it can, if need be, take a supine (‘purpose-of-motion’) complement (51). Npasentences are the only attested cases of utterance-initial consonant clusters (cf. 2.4. 1-2).

They are usually pronounced with a final long vowel and a non-level intona-tion (tee quick rising, péé slow rising, é€ slow lowering).

         The sound-symbolic words listed in Table 9.2 as interjections occurred generallywithout ka-support, but not always (54c). Some                  of them refer to noises related to, orproduced by, the action: in (54a), Iguana is making his typical noise as he climbs up atree; in (54b), Tapir is hitting a tree, to cause an old enemy to fall down; in (54c), a man isled back home by the barking of the dogs. In certain cases, the sound-symbolic word issimilar to the lexical verb stem used to describe the action (compare kif in (54d) withKitka ‘rub O’, and perhaps also with [t]ki ‘grate O°; jum in (54e) with juuka ‘bend O’;meen in (54f) with ame[mi] ‘roll O up’), but this is not always the case (cf. (54g-h)). It isinteresting to notice that some of these sound-symbolic words correspond to less ‘noisy’

 10. SYNTAX
10.1. Introduction. Of all aspects of grammar, it is in the realm of syntax that Caribanlanguages are least understood, in spite of having attained world celebrity with cases ofOVS as the basic word order (cf. e.g. Derbyshire & Pullum 1981). There are more detailedstudies for two          languages,        Carib     (also known            as Kari’na: Hoff             1968,    1978,        1986,    1990,1995, and also Gildea 1994a) and Hixkaryana (Derbyshire 1979, 1985, 1986a). The syntaxof four        other    languages       has      received      some        attention:    Apalai         (Koehn        &     Koehn      1986),De’kwana (Hall 1988), Macushi (Abbott 1991, Carson 1981), and Waiwai (Hawkins 1998).","[502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512]"

10.3.1. Equative (‘verbless’) clauses. The combination of a two noun phrases (54a-b), or anoun phrase and a postpositional phrase (54c-h), or a noun phrase and an adverb (54i) or aparticle (54j-l), can occur as a well-formed utterance in Tiriyé. The second element formsthe predicate, with the first noun phrase as its ‘subject’.'® If this ‘subject’ is understood, thepredicate    can occur by itself:       (54g)    is actually much          more     frequent    as a single-wordutterance.(54a)    seré, AIDS, epiti-min                                      (ob)    j-eka              Ranpi

         ‘This, AIDS, has no cure.’ (lit. ‘is cureless’).                   ‘My name is Ranpi.’
'§ As there is no verb in an equative sentence, it is difficult to assign its ‘subject’ to one of the participant
types discussed in 10.4.1. Its similarities with copular sentences suggest that it could be considered an S
participant.

        ‘There is something else to tell.’                      “There is tobacco.’        The meaning of an equative clause is often undistinguishable from that of a copularclause (cf. 10.3.2.1): (54a-f) all have copular equivalents. It would seem that an equativeclause is a copular clause from which the copula is missing. This seems even more clearlyso for negative sentences, in which the semantics is apparently the same with or without thecopula (55a-b).(55a)   in-enee-wa        wi             (b)   in-enee-wa_w-a-e

As so often in grammar, gradients are therule. The above classification should thus be seen as a reference grid superimposed on amore nuanced form-meaning continuum.","[464, 465, 466]"

         The non-equative clause types (which one might call ‘verbed’ clauses) can all befurther subdivided       into copular,      intransitive      and   transitive    clauses,      depending   on   theargument     frame   of its verb. Most       negative clauses       are, structurally,       copular or equative;however, given their functional homogeneity, and also the existence of some deviant types,they are discussed separately (10.3.5). The same is done for questions, which can arguablybe placed in any of the four basic types          (10.3.6).",[564]
"        The full grade of the collective suffix -to(mo) (and presumably of -ko(mo) and-kontoko(mo)      as well, though no examples occurred in the available corpus) can have avocative value:

Notice that most cases areformed by the loss of the final syllable of the non-vocative        form.   A special genericvocative jai, apparently equivalent to jako, also occurred in these stories.(90a)   aware     ‘opossum’     =      awa     ‘opossum!’

5. VERBS        Of all Tiriyé lexical classes, the verbal class is the easiest to characterize.                     A numberof different grammatical         markers   indicating person,          number,     tense-aspect-modality           (cf.5.4), as well as a number of derivational affixes (cf. 5.3) are exclusive to verbs. The samecan be said about the participial or -se forms (cf. 5.4.3.1.3), including the negative form(the negative marker -sewa only occurs on verbs; the particle _ta(ike)                        [cf. 9.1.4] is usedwith other lexical classes). These morphological properties are so salient that there can beno doubts about the status of a given stem. Although there are, as could be expected, lessand more prototypical verbs, the difference between them lies in details (for instance,certain verbs are semantically incompatible with speech act participants and thus can onlybe conjugated in the third person: e.g. ahta ‘to drip’, kaarapa(mi) ‘to ferment’, etc.), or inhow regular they are (cf. e.g. 5.4.4 on the forms of the copula ei).","[245, 246]"

6.2.1. Nominal adverbialization. The first striking feature of nominal adverbializers istheir formal division into t-adverbs and i-adverbs. Their meaning is centered in the areaof possession (“having’ or ‘not having’ the objects, properties, etc. denoted by the original_se, followed by the negative particle _ta(ike)). Some speakers considered them distinct in pronunciation,
but no consistent differences were found.

"Their treatment as independent particles rather than affixes was motivated by their lowcategorial specificity: they can occur after any of the lexical classes (including particles,which take place in no morphological processes).

(52b) has an example ofnesting: [ [ [ nééré_ré ]_ja ]_réken] ‘only by this precise person’.!” On this basis, particlesare analyzed here as elements that can be ‘adjoined’ to any of the extant constituent types
""’ Notice that nééré already corresponds to a combination of the third-person animate anaphoric pronoun néré
with the particle _ré (cf. 9.1.4), i.e. _ré ‘occurs’ twice in this example. In fact, some combinations involving
scope particles have lexicalized to varying degrees (cf. again 9.1.4, and also 6.1.1.4 on ke(ne) adverbs).

        From the formal viewpoint, it is noteworthy that most of the verbalizers (except -ka,-ke(pi), and -wa) can be divided into pairs with a nasal and a non-nasal member: -hté/-nté,-pa/-ma, -ta/-na, and -pa(mi)/-ma(mi). Such pairings are reminiscent of the nominal pastsuffixes -hpé and -npé, which are distributed according to possessed noun classes: -hpéoccurs on possessed -ri class nouns, -npé on possessed -@ class nouns or on non-possessednouns (cf. 4.3.1.5.1). Unfortunately,           a similar distribution does not seem to hold for theverbalizers: nouns of both classes can be found with any verbalizer, nasal or non-nasal (cf.the examples        in the following        subsections).      Although     one   may       speculate    that some

"          The negative adverbs show clear signs of negative adverbializers (cf. 6.2.1.2 fori- -nna ‘privative’, i- -:ra ‘inefficient’, ‘negative’) or particles (cf. 9.1.4 for the negative_ta(ike)). As was pointed out above, isunna and ipoinna                    ‘insipid, tasteless’ share a stemwith other adverbs         (suume     ‘sweet’, tiponje      ‘tasty’). The     adverb    iijeeta    ‘many,     a lot(inanimate)’     has   a nominalized       form iijanta (iijanonpéta           with the past -npé)          whichclearly identifies ta as an independent element;'° however, *jije or *iijan cannot be used
° The stem seems to be po(n) in tiponje and poi in ipoinna. This can be explained by assuming that the
stem was *poi, and that tiponje (pronounced [ti.po'p.pe]} is the result of palatalization (/Vin/ > [V'n)),
which, in accordance with the analysis of the sequence ['p] (cf. 2.4.2.1), is reinterpreted as /nj/. In this case,
the adverbializer would be t--ne, not t- -je: *tipoine > tiponje. Notice that the sequence /in/ does not
automatically result in [‘p] (e.g. weine ‘I was’ [vei.ne], apéine ‘catcher, one who catches (it)’) ([a_poi.ne],
etc.), but cases such as tiponje (and maybe also ponjeke ‘collared peccary’; cf. Apalaf poinoko, Wayana
péinéké) suggest that this may have been the case at an earlier stage. Another possibility is that *poi may
have come from *pojV, so that it really was *poj, with a final consonant, and that the sequence *jn, but not
the sequence *in, underwent palatization (the verb stems ei ‘copula’ and apéi ‘catch’, from which weine
and apéine derive, are reflexes of *eci and *apéci [cf. Meira 1998:165, 183], i.e. their i was not a glide).
 0 The pronunciation of these forms, [ii.jan.ta] and [iija.nom.pa.ta] (not *[ijaa.nom.pe.ta]), constitute the
justification for the spelling fijeeta (cf. 2.5.1 for rhythmic stress). This form is usually pronounced [ijee.ta],
an apparent homophone of ije_ta ‘not wanting it’ (the third-person form of the desiderative postposition

"9.1.1. Conjunctions. These particles indicate the relationship between their clause andthe ongoing    discourse.    They    are the main      markers   of parataxis.     Their most   obviousformal characteristic is occurrence in clause-initial position.

It is usually      followed        by    a verb     stem   in the   PresentPerfective, but the Present Imperfective is also attested. The form éwéh occurs when thecollective clitic particle _to(o) follows; it is not known whether or not the h correspondsto a reducing syllable, and what its full grade might be. Note that there is also an adverbéwé    ‘later’, used with Present and Future           forms,       which      contrasts   with   éwé(h)   by nothaving the final h when followed by _to(o) (1d-e)' When no clitics follow, the two wordsbecome homophonous; thus, (la-b) could also mean ‘I am going later’ and ‘we are goinglater’, respectively.

' Two H-Tiriy6 speakers maintained this distinction consistently; a third one, however, failed to distinguish
éwé(h) from éwé. This suggests the possibility of variation within H-Tiriy6. For K-Tiriyé, in which the
sound h does not exist, these two words are always homophonous (cf. 2.4.2.2 for details on the differences
between these two main dialects).

Its obvious source is thethird-person inanimate anaphoric pronoun iré ‘this (which was mentioned)’                      with theattributivizing postposition _me (i.e. ‘as this thing, ...’, ‘this being so, ...’). Since itsdiscourse uses seem far enough from the normal                 uses of _me      phrases, iréme is hereanalyzed as one single conjunction. There are other sentence connectors which still seemclose enough to simple postpositional phrases to warrant such an analysis, but they haveclearly acquired textual cohesion functions (2c-e; cf. also 10.4.2).(2a)   ma,   iréme,téin_ken_pa            wi-ka                ii-ja,

          The    conjunctions    méréme     and     képéewa      both     indicate    that   the   expectationsgenerated by previous discourse are not fulfilled (like English ‘but’). No obvious meaningdifference was detected between them. Méréme occurs more frequently with _re(pe) inthe preceding clause (4a-b), but not obligatorily (cf. (2b) above). Méréme                            apparentlycomes from the inanimate medial demonstrative méré ‘that one’ with the attributivizingpostposition _me. The meaning change for méréme                    (‘as that being’, ‘that being so’ >“‘but’) is more visible than was the case for iréme, which makes méréme an even bettercase of lexicalization.

2. Lexical particles:(a) Independent particles, which usually consitute, by themselves, an utterance.      (a-1) Sentence equivalents are more clearly lexicalized; they are a quick means              to convey the speaker’s reaction to a given situation (‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘all              right’, etc.; cf. 9.2.1).      (a-2)     Interjections     tend to have      emotional     or dramatic         content;          they    are              frequently        onomatopoeic,      sometimes      including        sounds          or        sound              sequences not otherwise found in the language, and some of them seem              to be nonce creations (‘oh!’, ‘hm-hm’, etc.’; cf. 9.2.2).(b) Ideophones, though sometimes showing signs of an onomatopoeic origin, are      more conventionalized than interjections; they occur in constructions with the      Sa verb stem Ka ‘say’ with lexical meaning (‘sneeze’, ‘drizzle’, ‘joke’, etc.; cf.",[463]
"The main reason for this decision is that elements like _rén(ne) can occur after too many' This state of affairs seems to be the result of diachronic change. For some of the above elements, free-
word sources can probably still be found (e.g. wiripé ‘evil thing, sin’ for ripi; cf. 4.2.1); others have
phonologically free cognates in sister languages (e.g. the collective markers to(mo), ko(mo); cf. 3.3.2).

The cost of this decision is that cases like 13a, in which _rén(ne)separates   -sepi from       the noun   maja     ‘knife’, must be considered       exceptional      (mayberemnants of a previous historical stage at which -sepi was freer). This labeling is adoptedas a convenient presentation device;           the   ‘reality’, insofar as it is knowable,   is closer toFig. 3.2, in which structural labels such as ‘clitic’ or ‘affix’ delimit prototypical cases.","[143, 144]"

One might wonder if it would not be possible to analyze the transitive stems as C-initial and the intransitive
stems as i-initial. However, they are so parallel in behavior that a unified analysis seems truer.
2 Tis perhaps worthwhile to mention that there are, among other neighboring members of the Cariban family,
languages which, like Tiriy6, have i-final A-marking prefixes (Wayana [Tavares, pers. comm.], Kali’na (Hoff
1968]), while others have only i-final A-marking prefixes (Waiwai [Hawkins 1998], Hixkaryana [Derbyshire
1985], Katxuyana [Gildea, pers. comm.], Apalaf [Koehn & Koehn 1986]). A detailed comparative study of
the allomorphic pattern of C- and i-initial stems may yield new useful criteria for subclassification.

"        Several occurrences of i- -:ra with @-nominalized verb stems were attested (e.g.(20a-b)). The meaning is that of an O-oriented negative potential adverb (‘cannot be V-ed’, ‘in-V-able’), the opposite of the meaning that non-possessed @-nominalizations havewhen followed by the attributivizer postposition _me (cf. 7.3.4.3). This meaning is quiteclose to that of i- -poora. The difference seems to lie in the degree of specificity of the Aparticipant: while i- -:ra has a generic A, i- -poora has a more readily identifiable one.(20a)   koko_réken           n-etapan-ja-n_mée,            aanao enee-ra

semantics observed, e.g., in (23e) suggest that we may be dealing with a new affix i- -tohpoora ‘negative

All the others have certain problems. Forinstance, t- -pore and i- -poora, the two affixes used to form modal adverbials indicatingability and inability (‘can V’ and ‘cannot V’) are best seen as nominal adverbializerswhich can also be applied to nominalized verb stems (@-nominalized stems for t- -pore,to(po)-nominalized stems for i- -poora; cf. 6.2.1.1.2 and 6.2.1.2.3, respectively). The -seforms, and the -tuuwé      ‘After’   and -tékéré   ‘Because’    forms, have certain non-adverbialfeatures such as person marking that make them better candidates for verb forms; they arediscussed in 5.4.3.
6.2.2.1. -té ‘Potential A’. This suffix only occurs on transitive verb stems. It derives a‘Potential Agent’ (“A.pot’) adverb, which can be used to predicate the general capacity ofcarrying out the action described by the verb, without a clearly specified O participant.

 A -té adverbial can be nominalized with the suffix -(no), becoming -to-(no) (cf. 4.2.2.1.1for a comparison of the meaning of -to-(no) with that of the actual A nominalizer -ne).","[388, 389, 390, 391, 392]"

original meaning  ‘person from the sea’; the Tiriyés do not have a word   for ‘sea’ anymore,   but cf. e.g.

Frikel    claimed     that    tirijo    means     ‘club    people’    or“murder people’ (wohl Keulen- oder Totschlégervolk, 1957:559); according to one of hisPréuyana consultants, the word comes from wdtiire ‘to kill with a club’.® This etymology,as Riviére 1969:17-18 has already pointed out, is not convincing. The word mentioned byFrikel is actually an idiom for ‘to kill’, literally wa(a) tiri ‘to make nothing, to annihilate,to kill’ (formed with the negative particle wa(a)               [cf. 9.1.4] and the t-adding verb stem[t]rt ‘do, make      O”   [cf. 5.1.3]);   the word    for ‘club’,      (si)warapa,    is unrelated.      It is notimpossible that the word tirijo be related to [t]ri (maybe meaning ‘the makers’, a possibleallusion to a presumably higher technological level). A more interesting (though also, forthe time being, speculative) possibility, already mentioned in Meira 1998a:11(fn. 3), is to
(dialectally   and   geographically       determined)     subgroup        of Kari’na        speakers    (cf.   Hoff1968:26). According to Hoff, there are two main Kari’na groups: the tire:wuyu and themura-to. The Kari’na believe that the mura:to had intermarried with escaped Negroes(Maroons),     but not the tére:wiyu        (mura:to     is an obvious        borrowing,        originally fromSpanish-Portuguese        mulato     ‘half-breed’).     These    two      words,     if really    cognate,       aresuggestive of a possible closer relationship between Kari’na and Tiriy6.","[28, 29]"

3 There is a homophonous particle pena ‘already’; cf. 9.1.5.
“ The final syllable (ka) of these adverbs is apparently being lost. When a CCV-initial clitic follows, the full
grade form should always occur, but many informants (especially younger people) accept both a full and a
zero grade: atumaka_nkéré and atuma_nkéré ‘still warm, hot’, kutumaka_nkéré and kutuma_nkéré
‘still painful’, amimaka_nkéré   and amima_nkéré     ‘still stingy, selfish’, etc.

"The only exception is the Distant Past form, which is invariable. It would be rather odd toconsider these verb forms as ‘derived postpositions’, resulting from a process of ‘verbalpostpositionalization’. In spite of the similarities (which, in the case of negative forms,

"Verbs have, in addition, a rich system of tense-aspect-mood markers. Nouns, on the otherhand,    take    a number       of derivational       suffixes    that        further    elaborate   their     meanings(diminutive, augmentative, predilective, etc.).               A further class of adverbs (which includesadjectival      stems,    not differentiable    from    other adverbs)            does     not inflect,      but can     benominalized. In fact, verbs, adverbs, and postpositions can all be nominalized in differentways,    with     different semantic     results.     Nouns      can     be     verbalized,      again    with   severaldifferent affixes resulting in different semantics, but members of other classes must benominalized before they can be verbalized. In addition, there is a class of particles whichcomprises all uninflectables (including, besides more ‘grammatical’ particles, also sound-symbolic words and interjections). A cross-cutting category of interrogatives, comprisingnouns and adverbs, can also be established.
                                                                                                                    23           Tirly6 syntax is also probably typical of its family, though the lack of studies onCariban syntax makes this claim difficult to assess. Recognizable constituents include anOV      verb phrase, a (possessor-possessed) genitive phrase, and a postpositional phrase;groups of appositional nouns can sometimes                     have phrase-like properties. In the simplesentence, the ordering of constituents is pragmatically determined, with topical elementstending to occur in initial position. Several kinds of dependent sentences occur, mostly(but not all) non-finite. Case marking depends on the sentence type: in most cases, it is(superficially) split-S, but there are also ergative and nominative sentence types. The twostrongest semantic roles are Agent and Patient, with good arguments in favor of Dative aswell;    all non-Dative        obliques      can be seen       as one broad        type    of Circumstantials       orPeripheral Participants. Grammatical relations (subject, object) are not really useful toolsfor the description of Tiriy6 syntax.","[43, 44]"

         An imperative verb does not seem to form a verb phrase with a preceding O nounphrase either, as is shown by the obligatory positioning of the second-position particle _moafter the O noun phrase in (48) rather than after the verb (cf. 5.4.2.1 for the use of _mo inthe future imperative). It is, however, true that the objects are always preverbal.Atempts toposition them postverbally usually cause negative reactions (unless a pause is inserted,suggesting an afterthought; (48c-e)).

old particle). In 5.4.4, it was mentioned that Tiriy6 has retained only one third-person form of the copula,
_hai, while other Cariban languages have two or three. It may be the case that *ma is a remnant of another
one of these forms (cf. 8.1 for other possible remnants).

9.1.3.3. _to(o) ‘Collective’. The particle _to(o) is used to indicate that a third-personparticipant is collective. With transitive verbs, if one of the participants is a non-third-person (i.e. if an A- or an O-marking prefix is used), then _to(o) collectivizes the other(i.e. the third-person)      participant.   If both   participants       are third persons,    then _to(o)collectivizes the O participant. With intransitive verbs, _to(o) occurs only in the thirdperson form, indicating that the S is collective. This pattern is exemplified in 5.4.1.2above; here, only its form and syntactic status are discussed. The fact that _to behaves asa second-position clitic can be seen in (25a-d) (note in addition that _to(o) cannot occurclause-initially). (25c) also illustrates its length grade _too.!!

         “They are all going.’                                         ‘They are all going now.’"" An older speaker occasionally had the form _toto instead of _to. There was variation among other
speakers as to whether or not this form was acceptable or even recognizable. Diachronically, it seems that
the original form actually was bisyllabic (cf. Gildea’s 1998:99 reconstruction of *toto to Proto-Carib), and
this may be the source of the observed long vowel in _to(o). Synchronically, the form toto seems to be, at
best, an archaism.

"5.1.3. T-adding stems. Certain verb stems have an unexpected prefix t- (ti-, if they areconsonant-initial) in the following forms, without any change in meaning:
         (a) nominalized forms without a preceding possessor (cf. 4.2.2.1);         (b) second-person imperative forms without a preceding object (cf. 5.4.2.1);         (c) third-person (prefixless) hypothetical forms (with the suffix -i; cf. 5.4.1.3.5);?         (d) supine (cf. 5.4.3.1.1) and indefinite negative (cf. 5.4.3.1.3) forms.*
3 Presumably, the same is true for the other non-factual forms (e.g. the incredulitive and admonitive forms),
but the necessary examples did not occur in the available corpus.
* The verb stem ée(pi) has an irregularity that looks related: it takes an unexpected t- prefix in its negative (t-
&e-sewa, t-ee-sewa; cf. 5.4.3.1.3) and ‘Actual S’ nominalized (t-éeh-ke(ti); cf. 4.2.2.1.3) forms. Note that
these are not the same as (a-d) above.

(6a- c) show a paradigm with the hypothetical inflection (including forms with the first- and second-person prefixes w- and m-, and the irrealis particle _mo), (6d-f) have imperative forms, (6g-j) have nominalizations, (6k-l) have supine forms, and (6m) has an indefinite negative form. Notice that, in (6g, i), the t- cannot be the third-person reflexive prefix, sincethe A participant is a first person.

* Because of this, one might want to analyze these stems as 1-initial rather than as C-initial (i.e. [t]ipT ‘bathe
©’, [t]ir¥ ‘do, make O” instead of [ti]pi, [ti]ri). However, since there are forms in which the whole ti syllable
is dropped, without the i being retained (7f, h, j), the consonant-initial analysis is preferred.

 10.2.2. Verb phrases. The most clearly phrasal sequence of words involving a verbalelement occurs when a third-person A and O (3AO)                 transitive verb form is immediatelypreceded by a noun phrase referring to its O participant. This OV phrase has an inflexibleword order (40a-b), its elements cannot be separated (40c-d), and second-position particlesmust follow it (40e-f). According to some (but not all) speakers, pauses also affect theacceptability of the utterance (40g).

         Thus, the combination of a prefixless 3AO transitive verb form (cf. 5.4.1.1.1) withapreceding overt noun phrase referring to the O participant is the only sequence that forms averb phrase.'? Considering the absence of a person-marking prefix on the verb, one mayfurther propose that the overt O noun phrase in the verb phrase is occupying the samesyntactic slot as the prefix (which is probably also true for postpositional phrases).                 A verbphrase is thus composed of a verb word provided with either a person-marking prefix or anovert O nominal (which is only possible in 3AO                    cases, since all other forms would haveone of the prefix). Thus, (44a-c) are examples of verb phrases, while (44d-e) are not.(44a)   [pahko amohté-n]              (b)        [n-amohté-n]              (c)     [w-amohté-e]

         Non-factual verb       forms    do not take the 3AO          prefix m-; in fact, they look verysimilar to the prefixless forms (except for the fact that the i- on consonant-initial stems isoptional in the prefixless form, but obligatory in the non-factual forms). However,                     evennon-factual forms apparently only form a verb phrase with a preceding O nominal, as isillustrated by the sudden semantic change caused by the insertion of the particle _mo. In

'? With consonant-initial stems, the prefixless verb form has an optional i-; cf. 5.4.1.1.1.

4 Considering the general pattern on verb phrases, one would expect the i- on the verb in the phrase [Kirinti
ituukai]_mo to be the ‘optional i-’ of the prefixless form rather than the ‘obligatory i-’ of the non-factual
forms. However, the few available examples all have i-; it is not known whether or not it can be dropped.

"         De-adverbial nominalizations cannot be possessed;                      their only possible role in apossessive phrase is that of possessor (28). Their behavior in noun-noun sequences isdiscussed in 10.2.1.3.

         Deverbal nominalizations vary in possessibility: some (-ne ‘Actual A’, n- ‘ActualO’, -@      ‘Specific Infinitive’, -to(po)      ‘Circumstantial’)        can be possessed,      while the others(-to(-no)      “Potential   A’,   i- -ke(ti)   ‘Actual    S’,   t-   -se(mi)   ‘Potential    O/S’,   -né   ‘GenericInfinitive’)     cannot.    The   non-possessible        deverbal     nominalizations       behave   like the de-adverbial nominalizations mentioned in the preceding paragraph: they can be the possessor,but not the possessed word, in a possessive phrase.

As far as could be ascertained, there isno syntactic difference between possessive phrases based on verbal nominalizations andthose based on monomorphemic nouns (with a special semantic detail: the possessor of thenominalization must correspond to one of the participants of the event described by theoriginal verb stem: the A participant in the case of the n- ‘Actual O’ nominalizer, and the Oor S participant for the others; cf. 4.2.2.1).

        Just as postpositions can vary along a continuum                    from more noun-like      to moreparticle/suffix-like cases (cf. 7.2), nominalized postpositional phrases vary from the onesthat look more like normal N i-N possessive phrases (31) to the ones that can only becompared    to N-N         possessive   phrases   (32).   More    ‘particle-like’   postpositions,   like thelocative _po, cannot be conjugated and thus do not even have a third-person form, whichmakes them unsuitable for the N i-N construction. Impressionistically, the latter kind looksmore    like the nominalization         of a ‘complex     adverbial’     than a possessive noun      phrase.","[543, 544, 545]"

           About examples such as these, the following suggestions come to mind:           (a) It is conceivable that small pauses in (8a-b) actually mark the initial elements(iré_mao, iré apo, meine) as extra-sentential although they were not clearly perceptible.           (b) Some    combinations       involving     particles    seem   to   show a     certain     degree     oflexicalization. Thus, as was said in 9.1.3.1, the verb té[mi] ‘go’ and the particle _pa oftenseem to form a unit (meaning ‘go away’,                ‘leave’). Wapo_pité        ‘at first’ (implying a laterchange), in (8a), may be one such case.","[518, 519]"

At the current stage of our knowledge, however, the following remark seems valid:           —     In order to understand           the behavior of Tiriy6 participants, semantic                   features(‘volitionality’,      ‘affectedness’,      ‘control’, etc.) do not seem crucial. Participants               that showall kinds of combinations of these features (e.g. the A participants of stems like tuuka ‘hitO’   and ene      ‘see O’, or the S participants of the S, and So verb stems listed in 5.2.2 and5.3.1.1)       seem   to   have   the     same    the   same      morphosyntactic      possibilities.      The      variouspossible       subgroupings       of participants,          and   the   morphosyntactic        treatment     that     thesegroupings receive, seem to be more insightfully understandable as consequences                                    of theirhistory. Thus, once one realizes that the t- -se(mi) nominalizer and the t- -se ‘Remote Past’are historically connected (cf. 4.2.2.1.2), the fact that both are involved in ergative patternsceases to look like a coincidence;               the same is true for the Negative, Supine              and HabitualPast constructions (cf. 5.4.3.1). In the spirit of Gildea (to appear), who suggests that wordorder for certain constructions may be a consequence of their diachronic evolution ratherthan the result of general discourse tendencies in the language, it may be proposed that casemarking        and syntactic alignment           patterns     may sometimes       be   ‘fossil remnants          of olderconstructions’        rather than indicators of synchronic meaning. The best candidate for thisinterpretation is the “‘epiphenomenal split-S system’ as described in 5.2.2.","[529, 530]"
