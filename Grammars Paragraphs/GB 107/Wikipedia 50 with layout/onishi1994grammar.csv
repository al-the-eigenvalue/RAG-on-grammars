Another example of the existential verb tu( h)-:14-33           hoo          ree-mo                   noo          tu-ro-ng?

As in 14-33, the Perfect form of tu(h)- expresses present existence. In a negative
sentence, when the Complement is followed by the negative particle toku and the
numeral noi 'alone/any' (cf. §8.2.2.1.1), the presence of the Perfect form of the verb
tu(h)- is optional (cf. 14-106).14-34           kuu-ngi            tuu       toku     noi        (tu-ro-ng).

  The irregular existential verb tu(h)- 'to be' (cf. §14.3.1.4) is changed to tuh-ee- 'to
have', a two-place intransitive verb, with a newS referring to the Possessor, and a new
C derived from the original S referring to the Possessee.

1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY AND LANGUAGE DATA    This grammar of Motuna is based on narrative texts, most of which were provided
by two main female informants, Dora Leslie from Kaakotokori village, and Therese
Minitong Kemelfield from Panakee village. They are native speakers of the standard7 Basic voice distinction may well be a typological feature common to most Non-Austronesian
languages in Bougainville. It is attested in Nasioi (middle voice corresponds to ""reflexive"" in Hurd and
Hurd 1966, 1970), in Nagovisi (middle voice corresponds to ""reflexive"" in Hunt and Hunt 1973) and in
Konua (middle voice corresponds to ""passive and reflexive"" in MUller 1954). The existence o~distinct
""reflexive"" category in Buin verbs is also suggested in Wurm (1975: 794).

and apart from these languages, Dora speaks her father's language Roviana (Austrone-
sian) in the Solomon Islands, and Therese her first husband's language Tinputz
(Austronesian) in Bougainville. They also speak neighbouring Non-Austronesian
languages such as Nagovisi and Buin to some extent.
    There are other texts by two elderly speakers, Sirou Korikee (female) and Puuwa
Paurarai (male) from Haarii village, which were recorded by Therese when she was
herself collecting narratives and accounts of Siwai tradition from old people.
    In all, my main corpus consists of twenty-three texts, in total duration of 138
minutes. As mentioned in § 1.2, there is very little dialectal variation among these
texts. The texts (I), (VIII) and (XVII) are given in Appendix for illustration. This
grammar is inductively formulated by examining the language data in these texts.
    In addition, I use three texts of the Pouko dialect obtained from Agnes Kennedy (in
her thirties) for supplement. The reason why I did not use these texts in the same way
as the main texts mentioned above is that the Pouko dialect is quite distinct from other
dialects (cf. §1.2). The former are also characterised by many more loanwords and
incomplete sentences than the latter.
    There are four more recorded
                           .
                                 texts.
                                    .
                                        Two of them are recorded from the telephone
conversation of Therese with another Motuna speaker. One is a free conversation
between Therese and her three daughters. And the last one is a personal history told by
a male speaker, Alex Dawuia (in his forties), from Mamangota village. All these texts
are characterised by loanwords from English and Tok Pisin, and loose conversational
style with lots of incomplete sentences. Sentences and vocabulary (especially loan-
words) found in these texts are occasionally used to illustrate particular aspects of the
grammar.
    Four short conversational texts, and a collection of 166 short sentences, written by
Dora Leslie, are also used to illustrate some grammatical points.
    All the examples cited from the above-mentioned data are identified at the end of
English translation in brackets. For example, (XI-13) indicates that it is taken from the
thirteenth sentence of the text (XI). If there is no number in brackets, the given
example is from elicitation. All the elicited examples were checked carefully by the two
main informants. Gaps in some areas of grammar --- especially in the paradigms of
nouns, classifiers and verbs --- are checked through elicitation. They were also
checked carefully by my two main informants.
    The main aim of this grammar is to present major characteristics of this language for
language typologists and linguists in general. It is not exhaustive, but it covers all the
grammatical aspects found in the narrative texts mentioned above. I give examples
quite generously whenever I discuss important grammatical P?ints. Sometimes the
Introduction                                                                                  7same examples are used in different chapters. Wherever it is relevant, the use of the
same example in different chapters is referred to in the text or in brackets after the data
identification number.
  Some aspects of the grammar --- such as the paradigms of numeral classifiers, the
use of the agentless passive construction --- are incomplete. These areas of grammar,
as well as detailed analysis of complex sentences and discourse organisation, investiga-
tion for sociolinguistic variation and genetic relationship with neighbouring languages,
are left for further research.

   My final word of thanks is due to Ayuko, Takashi and our newly-born little Motona.
 They created a joyful family environment which I regard as the most valuable thing in
 my life. I could get myself refreshed whenever I spent time with them. Our second
 son's name was taken from the language name ""Motuna"" with slight modification
 according to Japanese phonology. His name will always remind me and my family of
 the years we spent in Canberra, and of our special friendship with Motuna speakers.

Abstract
  This thesis is a descriptive grammar of Motuna, a Non-Austronesian language
spoken by several thousand people in the south-western part of Bougainville (called
Siwai), Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Buin Family of the Eastern Bougainville
stock, in the Bougainville Phylum. This grammar is based on the analysis of narrative
texts provided by four speakers of the standard Motuna.
  Motuna is a both head and dependent marking agglutinative language with complex
morphology. Like most Non-Austronesian languages in Papua NewGuinea, it is verb
final, and has medial and non-medial verbal categories. In addition, verbs have basic
voice distinction between active and middle voices, and have extensive tense/as-
pect/mood categories. Nouns have six genders and are also classified by fifty-one
classifiers.
  Chapter 1 discusses the typological characteristics, as well as the genetic relations
and dialectal variations of Motuna. It also briefly summarises previous work done on
this language, and provides the scope and data base of this thesis.
  Chapter 2 deals with phonetics, phonology and orthography. It includes an introduc-
tion to morphophonemics which will be discussed fully in later chapters, particularly in
Chapter 4 (nouns), Chapter 8 (classifiers, numerals and the 'all' quantifier), and
Chapter 13 (verbal morphology).
  Chapter 3 outlines the word-classes and the clausal syntax of this language. Chap-
ters 4 - 9 deal with the mopho-syntax of all the word classes except for verbs, partici-
ples and verbal nouns. Chapter 10 discusses the internal structure of the NP, and
Chapter 11 possessive, kinship and other constructions.
  Chapter 12 outlines the morpho-syntax of verbs. I give a gist of verbal morphology
in this chapter, so that readers may skip Chapter 13 which is a lengthy discussion of
complicated verbal morphology. Chapter 14 discusses valency of verbs including
valency-changing derivations (stimulative, causative, applicative and reciprocal).
Chapter 15 deals with tense/aspect/mood. Chapter 16 deals with two word classes
derived from verbs .,.-- verbal nouns and participles.
  Chapter 17 discusses the interclausal relations in Motuna, mainly chaining of medial
verbs and relative clauses.
  Finally, three narative texts of this language are provided in Appendix.

15.5     ASPECTUAL VERBS     Motuna has five aspectual verbs, which are preceded by an SS medial form or a
Definite Future form. TAM inflections of these aspectual verbs are restricted in the
following way:(1) tu(h)- 'to be' expresses duration25 or habituality:
             GEN.SS/ CONT.SS + /tu(h)-/ (PRES, PRESPERF, HABPAST, FUT,
                             IMFUT, IMAG, IMP, 26 OPT, NEGOPT, GEN.SS, GEN.DS)
(2) nang- 'to be' expresses duration or habituality:
             GEN.SS + /nong-/ (FUT)25 I use the term ""durative"" to cover ""continuous"" (as regards states) and ""progressive"" (as regardsevents).
26 Note that the existential verb tu(h)- does not have Future, Imaginative and Imperative forms. cf. fn
14.
Tense/ Aspect/Mood                                                                         477(3) konn- 'to walk/move' expresses progressivity (only with action verbs and termina
           tive verbs):
           GEN.SS + lkopin-/ (PRES, PRESPROG, HABPAST, FUT, IMFUT,
                           IMAG, GEN.SS, GEN.DS, CONT.DS)
(4) pi(h)- 'to go' expresses perfectivity (only with action verbs and terminative verbs):
           PERF.SS + /pi(h)-/ (PRES)
(5) ngo- 'to do' expresses immediate future (only with action and terminative transitive
           verbs):
           DEFFUT + lngo-1 (PRES, PRESPROG, GEN.SS, GEN.DS)
  That these verbs function as operators at nuclear level (cf. Foley and Olson 1985:
33-34), and not as proper verbs which coordinate or subordinate the preceding verbs,
is demonstrated by the facts that:1) the aspectual verbs cannot take arguments of their own.
2) no morpheme can intervene between the aspectual verb and the preceding medial
    verb or verb in Definite Future. In particular, the negative particle toku cannot
    intervene between these two morphemes. In clause chaining, on the other hand,
    toku can intervene between the marked clause and the controlling clause, .and
    negate only the controlling verb.","[505, 506]"

  The discourse marker nee 'it must be-, O.K.?' indicates that the speaker wants to
confirm that his/her information or idea is shared with the addressee. (The speaker may
address him- or herself, as in 9-7).
  The first syllable ne of nee is always pronounced with a high pitch, which is fol-
lowed by a sharp falling contour in the second syllable e. cf. §2.8.9-7        ih!        nii       nee            mara-nno            konn-opi-h=nuto-ng.

           (XI-21)9.1.5     nehe 'do you agree?'
  The discourse marker nehe is similar to nee both in meaning and syntactic behaviour.
  Nee signals that the speaker is quite sure that his/her idea is shared with the ad-
dressee, and he/she is only confirming it. In the case of nehe 'do you agree?', on the
other hand, the speaker is not so sure about it.
  As is the case with nee, the first syllable of nehe is always pronounced with a high
pitch, which is followed by a sharp falling contour in the second syllable he. cf. §2.8.9-9        ... hoo          mara           hoo-jori       ti-weena      tuh-ah   nehe

     The discourse marker ai 'I tell you' signals that the speaker is going to tell the
addressee a fact, or his/her own idea. It can be placed anywhere in a sentence, but
most frequently after the sentential topic.9-11           nii       az                rumanung-ngung-ngi                uko-m-a-a-ng.

     The interjection ai 'or' is homonynous with this discourse marker. cf. 9.5.4.9.1.7 noo 'possibly, may I ask?, take'
  The discourse marker noo 'possibly, may I ask?' is often used in interrogative
sentences (as in 9-13 and 9-14). In a sentence consisting of noo and a noun phrase, the
speaker asks the addressee to take the object referred to by the noun phrase (as in
9-15). 29-13           tiitii.         tuu         noo           no-'ra                      tuh-ee-n-na-na?

I do not know how to interpret noo in this sentence. It seems to be somehow related to the noo
discussed above, but I cannot pinpoint the common semantic component at this stage.

  The discourse marker poko 'there's no other way, had better' always occupies the
second position in a sentence. It signals that the speaker is forced to accept a certain
situation, or the necessity of a certain action. The speaker signals the end of a conver-
sation or show the agreement to the other's proposal, by using poko in set phrases with
mirahu 'good' (as in 9-16) and oso 'O.K.' (as in 9-17b).9-16       mirahu poko                           manni.          urisih-i-woro.

9.3    THE EMPHATIC SUFFIX /-ko/
  The emphatic suffix /-ko/ can be attached to any word except for interjections. It can
modify a particular word, phrase, clause or sentence. It singles out the element it is
attached to.
  When it modifies a clause or a sentence, or a conjunction or a discourse marker, it
expresses the concessive meaning 'even, if only'. It can also mark two successive
clauses or sentences, with the meaning 'A, and also B'.","[225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"

The paradigms of verbs in Motuna are described according to this classification.
  Verbs take TAM suffixes listed in Table 12-3a- c after cross-referencing mor-
phemes. In addition, the negative infix /-woo-/ can be placed between cross-
referencing markings and the Imaginative, General DS, Continuous SS or DS medial
suffix. TAM suffixes may be followed by gender suffixes in the case of fully inflected
non-medial verbs, or may be fused with a switch-reference marking in the case of
medial verbs. Schematically,

  In 15-152a and b, the verb unu-ko-ng is used as a proper verb. It takes a peripheral
argument noni-nno. Furthermore, in 15-152a, the negative particle toku can intervene
between the controlling clause with this verb and the marked clause with the medial
verb hu-mo. In 15-152b, the marked clause with the medial verb hu-mo is placed after
the controllong verb unu-ko-ng.
 The first four aspectual verbs listed above are intransitive. They cross-reference the
person of the most salient core argument of the preceding verb, according to the
hierarchy given in Diagram 13-17 in § 13.3.4. For example,15-153a roki         inak-u-mo                 nu-ku             honna'-heeta-na.

             'And while she kept looking after me, I grew up.' (VI-9)
  In 15-153a, the aspectual verb tu(h)- cross-references the 1st person of the A
argument, and in 15-153b, the 1st person of the 0 argument, of the verb inak- 'to look
after'. 1st person A and 0 are more salient than 3rd 0 and A respectively, according to
the hierarchy mentioned above.",[507]

  The realisation of the 1st person A suffix is as follows:
      Rule 13-12      Realisation of 1st Person A Suffix
            The following rules apply before Rules 13-1- 13-5.
            The 1st person A suffix, in singular, is combined with the following TAM
             suffixes to take various forms:             (a) {1st A} -m -> -o-m
             (b) {1st A} -k -> -ong
            (c) {1st A} -w, -h -> -op
            (d) {1st A} -r -> -oNn
            (e) {1st A} -i -> -os-i
            (f) {1st A} -juu -> -osuu
            (g) {1st A} -u -> -ot-u
            (h) {1st A} -o -> -om-o
            It is realised as /-opi/ before the dual suffix /-til:            (i) {1st A} -> -opi I_ -ti
            In paucal/plural number, it, again, takes various forms. It fuses with the /r/
            of the Perfect and Negative Optative suffixes, and /w/ of the Optative suffix
            and the negative infix. It is realised as -opi word-finally, as -opi-r10 before
            a vowel, and -oN in other environments.","[334, 335]"

  Remote Past 1-u/ describes an event which took place long ago (at least more than a
year or so before the speech moment), and which has no relevance to the present
situation. It is rarely used with totally stative verbs (1) (but see 15-61 below).
  This is the TAM which is used most frequently in my corpus of traditional narra-
tives, in which the narrator describes past events objectively. For example, see the
following sequence of sentences, in which all the main verbs are in Remote Past.

     The narrator can, however, freely switch to Present to achieve the vivid description
of a past event. cf. § 15.3.2.
     I have only one example of the copula tu(h)- in Remote Past in my corpus:15-61         ong         waasiih hoo                     napa-nno              mahkata-nno              u'kisa

According to my informants, tu(h)- in this context means that they were enemies to
each other after they had lived together, but it does not specify whether that relation has
lasted till now or not.
13   napa-nno ... tu'ni is a Possessor attributive clause. cf. §17.1.

   Immediate Future /-hee-MID-ko/ describes an event or state which is about to take

question (cf. §2.6), Definite Future is used as a rhetorical question:15-83       he'ee!         tiko      ua-ko             kumar-opee?

           The reference point of time may not be the speech moment, but may be supplied
      from the context. It could be some time in the future (as in 15-85), or in the past (as in
      15-86 and 15-87).      (i) the speaker predicts that an event or a state will take place immediately after the•point

           Dependent embedded clauses with verbs in Defmite Future function as the Comple-
      ments or the peripheral arguments of the superordinate predicates, and may either
      precede or follow them.
           Verbs which take Definite Future verbal clauses as Complements include haa- 'to
      agree/want' and kaah- 'to disagree/not to want' (§ 14.3.1.1), haa-jee- 'to need/want'
      (§14.6.1), tiik- 'to say' (§14.3.1.2), mi'no- 'to instruct sb' and tiih- 'to tell sb'
      (§ 14.3.2.1).
           As peripheral arguments, they indicate the purpose of the action referred to by the
      superordinate verb.

15.4.1 Overview
     Motuna has five ""medial"" TAM suffixes which mark switch-reference.
     As will be discussed in Ch 17, the clause which has a verb marked by one of these
suffixes as head is syntactically non-embedded in most cases. 21 It is, however, usually
followed 22 by another clause which ""controls"" its TAM and SS/DS marking. I will call
the clause which has a medial verb as head ""marked clause"", and the clause which
controls its TAM and SS/DS marking ""controlling clause"".23
     Among the five medial suffixes, the General SS, General DS and Perfect SS suffixeS
are primarily attached to the stems of dynamic verbs (mainly verbs (3) and (4), and
sometimes verbs (2) when the focus is on unstable or habitual states, or on the incep-
tion phases of states). The Continuous SS and DS suffixes, on the other hand, are
primarily attached to those of stative verbs ((1), (2), (3b) and (4b)). Schematically,

       stative verb stem +                Continuous /-if            Continuous 1-juu/
     Roughly speaking, the temporallaspectual concepts expressed by the General and
Perfect SS suffixes are covered by the General DS suffix, and those expressed by the
Continuous SS suffix are covered by the Continuous DS suffix. But, as will be seen
below, they are not exactly symmetrical.","[483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493]"

  The paradigm of the transitive verb /noh-/ 'to say to/think about', with all the Ti}M
suffixes listed in Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/feminine/dual-
paucal gender suffixes in Table 13-3, is discussed below. The stem-final/h-I is deleted
before a consonant due to Rule 13-16a. The combination of the stem-final/h-I and the
3rd person A suffix /-ul is optionally dearticulated to /HJ before a CV sequence (except
before the sequences of /r/ and a high vowel in Near Past and Remote Past) due to Rule
13-20d. The vowel /of of the stem is assimilated to the following a due to Rule 2-9a.

negation. In negation it refers to the state before the inception of the event:pi(h)- 'to go' (3a):

In some cases, the Continuous SS form of a dynamic action verb is used in affirmation
to describe the manner of an activity, rather than the activity itself:ngo- (middle) 'to be involved in an event' (3a):

           'Then, while advancing quiefuc, he caught one of them.' (XIII-63)
  The DS form of a dynamic action or tenninative verb, on the other hand, is used to
express the continuation of a state resulting from a completed event ( 15-143 - 15-145).
In negation, it expresses the state before the inception of the event ( 15-146).

  Syntactic constructions, on the other hand, are not lexical units. Their meanings are

    [ART.M      mango          fall.3S-HABPAST]-LINK-CL.season
    'the season when mangoes fall'
  The first example above is a so-called bahuvrihi compound with the numeral noi,
incorporating its NP argument (cf. §7.1.3 and §8.2.2.1.1). Three grammatical words,
nii-nno, koro=koro and noi-ngung, constitute a single grammatical unit. The second
example is a classifier construction, in which the classifier -mori is combined with an
intransitive verb with its S argument via the linker -no- (cf. §8.1.3 .2.5). Here again,
three grammatical words, hoo, kongsi' and haaro'-ki-no-mori, constitute a single
grammatical unit. I will hereafter associate such grammatical units by square brackets
in the interlinear text, as is shown in the above examples.

  The functions of General DS roughly correspond to those of General and Perfect SS.
It simply sets up the time frame for the event described by the controlling clause.
Specifically, it expresses that:
 466                                                                                                     Chapter 15 (i) the event expressed by the marked clause has been completed before the event
 expressed by the controlling clause takes place (this function corresponds to that of
 Perfect SS): 15-106     tiwo=tii'-ku                            sih-a-a-ng.

            'After he had said that way, they left him.' (XII-24)
 (ii) two events are simultaneous or successive habitual events. Alternatively, the event
 expressed by the marked clause may be interpreted as the condition under which the
 habitual event described by the controlling clause takes place. (These functions
 correspond to (ii) and (iii) of General SS): 15-107     tii          uri       pata'-ku                   oi                   raang   koho si'mata

 General DS cannot express a progressive event. However, the combination of the verb
 in General SS, and the general DS form of the aspectual verb tu(h)-, can describe such
 an event, which is simultaneous with the event described by the controlling clause (this
 function corresponds to (i) of General SS): 15-108    paa-mo                   tu-ku                          noh-u'-na: ""... ""

            'While she was crying, I said to her:               II ••• II   '   (XV -57)
   Continuous SS and DS express situations in which the events described by the
. controlling clauses takes place. These suffixes are most commonly attached to stative
 verbs: 15-109     ... ore        peh=pehkita              nu-i                        ti-ki        miisini-ngori-ki

            '... well, (the big flood) happened while I was very small and I was in the
            mission.' (VI-29, cf. 14-31)
 They do not seem to be attached to the sterns of dynamic action or terminative verbs
 very often. The Continuous SS suffix, in particular, rarely occur with those verbs,
Tense/ Aspect/Mood                                                                        467except in negation or to describe the manner of activities rather than the activities
themselves. See further discussion and examples in§ 15.4.5.","[494, 495, 496]"
"
    Among the medial verbal forms, Perfect SS cannot be used with totally stative verbs
( 1). It is used with inchoative stative verbs (2) to focus on the inception of the states,
and with verbs (3) and (4) to focus on the completion of the events. On the other hand,
Continuous SS is used with verbs which belong to (1), (2), (3b) and (4b) to express
the continuation of states, but it is rarely used (except in negation, or to describe the
manner of an activity as is the case with konn-) with dynamic action verbs and termina- ,
tive verbs (3a and 4a).",[467]

           'My mother, my elder brother, my (one) brother after me, my little younger
           sister who was just born and was (with us), and me, whose age was about
           five.' (II-4)9.4.2 The Suffix -nno 'and' as a Coordinating Conjunction
  The suffix -nno is used to conjoin two nouns within a noun phrase. Note that the
syntactic function of this suffix differs from that of the comitative case suffix -nno
which conjoins two NPs. cf. §3.2.2.3 and 9-53 above.
  In the following example, two nouns nuka and umoka, coordinated by the suffix
-nno, constitute the head of the ergative noun phrase tii-ngi nuka-nno umoka-nno.9-54       ... tii-ngi            nuka-nno         umoka-nno       no-m-u-'-na: ""... ""
                 ART.DP-ERG       my.mother-and    my.father-and   say.to-10-3A-dl.RMPAST-F
           ' ... my mother and father said to me: "".. .''' (VI-10)
  In the following example, the noun phrase poowoi-nno by itself constitutes the head
of an absolutive noun phrase, which functions as a term of address:9-55       oi      po-owoi-nno.
           hey     my-brother-in-law-and
           'Hey, brother-in-law (and someone else).' (V-17)
                                         ~tVr\s.
In this case, the suffix -nno indicates/\as if the speaker addresses not only the listener
referred to by po-owoi, but another person who is not overtly referred to. This is a
device to express politeness towards the addressee with the implication of duality. cf.
§4.2.2.

9.4.3.1 impa 'and then, now'
   The local noun impa 'this time, now' (cf. §4.4.2.5) functions as NP head. Like any
local nouns/pronouns, it can function as an adverbial modifier of a verb by itself:9-56          hoo      nee          muumiaku           impa         patak-u-i=to-ng.

              'The lord(= my dearest son) must be arriving now.' (1-10)
    The conjunction impa, on the other hand, is used to connect a clause with a preced-
ing independent clause (as in 9-58 and 9-59) or medial clause (as in 9-57). It is always
placed at the beginning of a second clause, introducing the description of an event
which the speaker wants to focus on. It is often used to introduce a new topic in the
discourse (as in 9-58b and 9-59).9-57          umi-ro                       impa               ruu         ong      angumuuka

    The conjunction mannilma'ni5 'then, so, certainly' is also used to connect a clause
with a preceding independent clause (as in 9-60b) or medial clause (as in 9-60a). It
indicates that the speaker is going to describe an event, which logically or naturally5   The form ma'ni is attested only a few times in the texts by two female speakers.

(9-61). It may be placed at the beginning of a clause {9-60a), or after the first or
second word of the clause, especially after the sentential topic (9-60b and 9-61).9-60a       tiwo=tiih-ku                                                    haa-u-u-na

            'No! She certainly(= as you suspected) did not move.' (VII-47)
    It is often used in combination with the conjunction tiko. See 9-62d in §9.4.3.3.9.4.3.3 tiko 'and, then, so'
   The conjunction tiko 'and, then, so' probably derives from the local article tii in the
purposive case.
   Tiko introduces an independent clause, and connects it to the preceding clause which
is also usually independent. 6 It indicates the temporal or logical sequence of a chain of
events. Observe the following sequence of sentences at the beginning of a narrative:9-62a       kupuna-no-ru                     hoo         Siuai-no-po                         ong      tui

6             -a~c;.~
  I \:-.~ve a fewl\examples where the preceding clause is a medial clause. Such a medial clause,
however, may be regarded as a separate sentence on a phonological ground (cf. §2.8 and§ 17.1). e.g.:
            haaro'-ro             manni.         tiko         jeewo-ning       koto   ngo-woro-hee?

Note that in 9-62d, where the narrator describes an activity which is the consequence of
the situation described in 9-62a- c, she uses the conjunction manni in addition to tiko.9.4.3.4      hoo(=hoo) 'so, now, then'
  The conjunction hoo(=hoo) 'so, now, then' obviouly derives from the masculine
form of the article hoo, which vaguely summarises the background situation expressed
in the previous clause (9-63) or understood from the context (9-64 and 9-65). The
second hoo, which is optional, derives from the same article functioning as a topic
marker. (The second hoo, if present, is invariably stressed. cf. §6.2.6.) Hoo( =hoo)
thus introduces a sentence or a clause, often with a new topic, with a certain illocution-
ary force:9-63         roo           tii          manni        toku      kumar-i-heeta-na.        hoo=hoo

  The conjunction tiko 'because' seems to derive from the local article tii in purposive
case, and the optional hoko from the masculine article hoo with the emphatic suffix -ko;)
The conjunction tiko( =hoko) is always placed at the beginning of an independent
clause, which denotes the cause of the event described by the previous independent
clause.9-66      impa-ko        hoo    toku      mu-kui-na.          tiko=hoko        hoo     Sande

  The conjunction roruki 'but, however' expresses that the sentence contrasts with the
previous sentence, or with something which is understood from the context. It may be
placed at the beginning of a clause (9-68b), or after the word which focuses on such
contrast (e.g. after the negator toku and the discourse marker nah-ah 'possibly' in
9-69b).

9.5        INTERJECTIONS  Interjections are the words which either can constitute single utterences by them-
selves, or are syntactically isolated from other elements in a sentence. They can be
subcategorised as follows:
( 1) emotive interjections
(2) interjections for attracting attention
(3) interjections for response
(4) filler words
  The endings of emotive interjections, and some interjections for response, are
characterised by a level high pitch (cf. §2.8).
  Note that in some interjections, such as ehe;ehee 'laughter', u'uung 'yes', hu'uung
'no' and he'ee 'no', a glottal stop occurs between vowels, which is not permissible in
general phonotactic rules (cf. §2.4.1).","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245]"

(5) The ending of the so-called emotive interjections (§9.6) is characterised by a level
high pitch. The last word of a declarative sentence may also be uttered in the same kind
of level high pitch, with a long pause after that. In Figure 2-17 in page 37, the last
word of the first sentence haarokuung is pronounced almost in a falsetto tone, after
which the speaker deliberately suspends the utterance of the following sentence (for one
and half second) to draw the attention of the addressee. The latter sentence describes an
event which is crucially related to the event described by the previous sentence. 29
29 The first sentence in Figure 2-17 describes how the heron fell into the water. The second sentencedescribes how helpless the heron was after that. The two sentences are given below:

2.9      ORTHOGRAPHY
     I follow the orthography adopted by Oliver (1955: xxii) except for /ng/, which he
transcribes as ""IJ"", and /w/, which he transcribes as ""v"".
     In the orthography in Bible translations, the Catholic missions tend to use ""j"" ,30
while the United Church ""y"", 31 for /j/. Both ""r"" and ""d"" are used for /r/. 32
     I use /j/ for the back glide because: ( 1) ""j"" seems to represent the allophonic range of
this phoneme better than ""y"" (cf. §2.2.4), and (2) ""y"" is confusingly used to represent a
non-phonemic transitional glide [j] which is heard after Iii and before a non-high vowel
(cf. Rule 2-8 in §2.3).
     On the other hand, I use the symbol /w/ for the labial glide. This symbol seems to be
well-established among native speakers, 33 although it is also confusingly used to
30
     as in So Gosipeli Maka (1952).
31
     as in So wasiih mirahu Matiu ki kehurung (1968).
32
   So wasiih mirahu Matiu ki kehurung (1968) also uses ""b"", ""j"", ""g"", ""v"" and ""1"" for loanwords
(especially in personal names or place names).
33   All my informants use ""w"" for the labial glide, while some use ""y"" and others ""j"" for the palatal
glide. Gasaway ( 1987b) reccomends ""w"" and ""y"".
38                                                                               Chapter 2represent non-phonemic [w] after /u/ and before a non-high vowel (cf. Rule 2-8 in
§2.3).
 I use only ""r"" for /r/ because [d] is clearly a free allophone of /r/ which occur in
restricted phonological environments (cf. Rule 2-6 in §2.2.5).

   Words in Motuna are classified into the following categories on morphosyntactic
criteria:
(1) Major Word Classes
      (i) Noun (cf. Ch 4)
      (ii) Adjective (cf. Ch 7)
      (iii) Verb (cf. Ch 12)
      (iv) Participle (cf. Ch 16)
(2) Minor Word Classes
      (i) Pronoun (cf. Ch 5)
      (ii) Article (cf. Ch 6)
      (iii) Demonstrative (cf. Ch 6)
      (iv) Classifier (cf. Ch 8)
      (v) Numeral (cf. Ch 8)
      (vi) Quantifier (cf. Ch 8)
      (vii) Adverb (cf. Ch 7)
      (viii) Discourse Marker (cf. Ch 9)
      (ix) Negator (cf. Ch 9)
      (x) Conjuncion (cf. Ch 9)
      (xi) Interjection (cf. Ch 9)
  Verbal nouns --- a subclass of nouns --- are discussed in Ch 16.
  The words which belong to major word classes primarily function as the heads of
phrases (noun phrases, adjective phrases, verb phrases, and participle phrases, respec-
tively). Phrases are syntactic units which constitute clauses (cf. §3.2).

      word classes -at~t,            all the others. Some of them function as substitutes for,
or modifiers of, major syntactic units. Others carry out various syntactic and pragmatic
functions.
  Motuna is predominantly an agglutinative language. It is often the case that a word
contains one or more bound morphemes. In addition, there are various types of
40                                                                                       Chapter 3compounds and syntactic constructions. For example, kinship terms and classifiers are
bound lexical roots, which are combined with various bound morphemes and/or
words.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69]"
"
  In this chapter, I will discuss the paradigms of verbs in the following order:
(1) In§ 13.2, I will discuss the paradigms of cross-referencing S markings of intransi-
    tive verbs, in combination with the negative infix, TAM suffixes, and gender or
    switch-reference markings. I will discuss the paradigm of S0 verbs ( § 13 .2.1), SA
    verbs (§13.2.2), irregular verbs (§13.2.3), and middle verbs (§13.2.4) in tum. In
    § 13.2.5, the cross-referencing markings of intransitive verbs of all types are
    summarised.
(2) In §13.3, the paradigms of transitive verbs are discussed and summarised in the
    same way as above.
(3) In § 13.4, all verb stems are categorised according to their phonological shapes. I
    will discuss the morphophonemic processes, which affect them when they are
    combined with cross-referencing markings.",[314]

              look-3S-DEFFUT
10 The final /il of the Imaginative suffix /-kuil is realised as u before the archinasal/N/. cf. Rule 13-9
in §13.2.1.15.
11Verbs in Imaginative TAM take gender suffixes in independent clauses, but do not take them in
dependent embedded clauses. Compare 12-lOj with 12-11a.
12   The realisation of the Imperative suffix is highly irregular. See Ch 13.

ditional markings. Medial DS forms take General or Continuous suffixes which also
indicate a Different Subject category.","[291, 292]"

This suffix is susceptible to Rules 13-2 and 13-6. cf. fn 1.

following TAM suffixes. Those changes are summarised in §13.2.4.15.
     I found three verbs which take the 2nd person suffix beginning with In/ instead of
/r/, i.e. /noro/- /nee-til- /nee-ru/. They are: /sih-/ 'to be quiet', /tung-/ 'to enter', and
/ruh-/ 'to come out' .13

    Since the person and number of A and 0 NPs are obligatorily cross-referenced, in
 many cases A and/or 0 NPs can be left unexpressed without confusion. Thus the basic
· word order and case-markings of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses are:
 13 In other words, the ergative suffix marks the A argument which is not a sentential topic. In elicitation sessions, my informants sometimes marginally accepted sentences in which A NPs in
 ergative case are sentential topics at the same time. But I have found no such sentence in my entire
 corpus of narratives and daily conversation. This fits Wierzbicka's argument that 'the ergative marks
 the peripheral (less topical) actant' ( 1981: 69).

As discussed above, the choice between (1) and (3) depends on which argument is the
topic. (2) is used instead of (1) when A provides given information. The 0 NP, or the
A NP in ergative case, can be placed after the verb, when they provide new information
in the discourse. 15
     In addition to core arguments, many transitive verbs can take NPs in absolutive case,
verbal nouns, verbal clauses with verbs in Definite Future TAM, or sentences in
quotation, as Complements. Examples of absolutive NPs functioning as the Comple-
ments of transitive verbs are given below (see §14.3.2.1, §14.5 and §14.6 for the
examples of different types of Complements):3-65          hoo          impa             Keehno              tang-a-'-ko-ng.

              [ 0]                 c ]
              'Now people call them Keehno tribe.' (XI-30, cf. 14-39)3-66                 hoo       ko'sa            tii        Koimeke      nep-ee-wa-ro ...

                     [     c         [  ]      0      ]
              '... after they took the shell from Koimeke, (they) .. .' (VIII-34)
     Note that the verb stem nep-ee- in 3-66 is derived by the applicative suffix -(j)ee. It
introduces a new 0 argument (Koimeke) and moves the original 0 (hoo ko'sa) into
Complement status. (See also 3-24. See Ch 14 for a detailed discussion of valency-
changing processes.)
14   Unless another absolutive NP denoting location precedes and functions as a topic. e.g. 3-15.
15 The definitions of ""new"" and ""given"" information are according to Chafe (1976). See also fn 3 in§6.2.6. In Motuna, elements which provide given information are generally placed at the beginning,
while those which provide new information are placed at the end. This rule applies both at phrase and
clause levels. cf. Ch 10.

  Intransitive verbal clauses require only one core NP in absolutive case (S).
  Predicate verb phrases in intransitive verbal clauses typically express intransitive
actions, existence, possession, changes of state, processes, or inner experiences.
Thus, semantically, S could be the Agent, the Experiencer, the Theme, or the Patient.3-67      roo                 pee              tii        Maawo       poko-no.

  Absolutive or similative NPs, APs, PartPs, verbal nouns, Definite Future verbal
clauses, or sentences in quotation, can function as the Complements of certain intransi-
tive verbal clauses. (cf. 3-8, 3-21 and 3-60. See also §14.3.1 and §14.3.2.2.)3-71      ong               noo             toko=tokoh-ah             tu-ro-ng?

     A nominal clause consists of two noun phrases, which function as the argument and
the predicate in this order. 16
     The argument NP is always in absolutive case, and the predicate NP is either in
absolutive case, or a Possessor or a local noun with a gender suffix. Predicate NPs are
usually without determiner. 17
     Semantically, nominal clauses can be classified into (1) ""equational"", (2) ""posses-
sive"" and (3) ""local"" clauses. Nominal clauses with verbal nouns as predicates are
discussed separately inCh 16.","[89, 90, 91, 92]"

    SA person suffixes ---1-o(C)/, 1-opil and /-oN/ (1st), 1-il (2nd), and 1-u/ and /-wal
(3rd) --- are identical in form with, and undergo the same morphophonemic changes as,
A person suffixes in transitive verbs. Thus, in the morphophonemic analysis below,
they are simply called ""A suffixes"".
    Note that the initial/w/ of the 3rd person paucallplural A suffix /-wal is dropped after
a consonant. See Rule 13-16b in §13.4.1. Nonsingular number may be expressed by
a person suffix (/-oN/ for 1st paucallplural and /-wal for 3rd paucallplural), or by an
additional number suffix /-til (dual) or 1-ru/ (paucallplural).
    Inclusive/exclusive distinction does not exist in A cross-referencing suffixes. 9
    The full paradigm of the SA verb /mon-/ 'to look', with all the TAM suffixes listed in
Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/feminine/dual-paucal gender
suffixes in Table 13-3, is discussed below. I will not make comments on the morpho-
phonemic processes which have already been discussed in § 13.2.1. The realisation of
1st person A suffixes is highly irregular; it is summarised in §13.2.2.15.                Note that
the vowel/of .of the stem is assimilated to the following a due to Rule 2-9a.","[327, 328]"

Acknowledgements
  First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to three ladies, without whose
assistance this thesis would never have been completed.
  Two of them come from Bougainville. Dora Leslie initiated me into her beautiful
language, taught me and answered my endless questions with utmost patience. Therese
Minitong Kemelfield told lots of interesting stories to me. Her fervent discussions on
Siwai culture were ever so inspiring. For both of them, the last four years must have
been the most dreadful time in their lives --- their mothers and other close relatives were
suffering from the political conflict on the island, and there was no way for them even
to communicate with their own people most of the time. In spite of this frustrating
situation, they never failed to address me with warmth in their hearts. All their family
members living in Australia have become very good friends of my family as well.
  Ulrike Mosel, my supervisor in chair, assisted me to write the thesis from beginning
to end with meticulous care. Before starting my PhD, I was virtually a novice in
writing a grammar. I saw the last four years as my apprenticeship, and she was the
most worthy Meisterin. She taught me not only how to write a grammar, but also how
to enjoy writing a grammar. Her liberal and flexible way of thinking very often saved
me from mental exhaustion.","[4, 5, 6]"

  Local nouns can also stand as predicates in nominal clauses. This construction

       referencing bound morphemes. Motuna also has a periphrastic passive construe;...
       tion (cf. § 16.3.4).
(2) Medial and non-medial verbs. I call the verbs which mark switch-reference ""medial
       verbs"", while those which don't ""non-medial verbs"".' Switch-reference mark-
       ings indicate whether the ""themes"" 2 of the medial verbal clauses are the same as,
       or are different from, those of the following clauses. 3 Fully inflected non-medial
       verbs, on the other hand, cross-reference the genders of the sentential topics.
(3) Fourteen TAM categories for non-medial verbs, and three for the same subject
       forms and two for the different subject forms of medial verbs.
(4) Verb stems may be underived or derived. Derived stems may take one or more of

  The underlying form of the Continuous SS suffix is /-if. This form surfaces, when it
is separated from the preceding cross-referencing suffixes by the intervention of the
negative infix /-woo-/. The paucallplural inclusive suffix /-ru/ is again dearticulated to
an archinasal due to (Rule 13-6).

    The Present Progressive suffix consists of /-i/ and /-tu(h)/. The suffix /-tu(h)/
derives from the existential verb /tu(h)-/. It inflects according to the person/number of

Present Perfect):

    The Present Progressive form is used only in an independent clause and is obligato-
rily followed by a gender suffix. The final /o/ of the inflectional endings of the suffix
/-tu(h)/ is assimilated to the feminine suffix (Rule 2-9), and are fused with the dual-3  That they are intervened by the boundary""="" rather than""-"" is shown by the following fact: the
change ri -> Q occurs either stem-finally or before a CV syllable where C is voiceless, and ri -> N
before a CV syllable where Cis voiced, due to Rule 13-5. We find the forms kaa-m-u-'-nuiee/
kaa-m-u-'-nuio-ng with 1st person paucal/plural inclusive Ss. Here, although the following In! is
voiced, /ri/ is realised as a glottal stop, and not as a nasal; this fact can be explained if we assume that
/ril is followed by a boundary between phonological words.

    The Perfect suffix /-ro/ is followed by a gender suffix in independent clauses.
Assimilation to a (Rule 2-9) and fusion with the dual-paucal gender suffix (Rule 13-11)
occur as usual. Note that the glide j does not occur in paucal/plural inclusive forms
when /-ro/ is followed by another morpheme. 4

13.2.1.5      Near Past
  The underlying form of the Near Past suffix is the same as that of the Continuous SS
suffix /-if. It is used only in independent clauses, and is obligatorily followed by a
gender suffix.
  The dual and paucallplural inclusive suffixes are fused with it in the same way as
with the Continuous suffix. The fused forms I-s-if and /-r-i/ further undergoes Rules
13-3 and 13-5 respectively, and the former is realised as-h, while the latter -n, before
the dual-paucal gender suffix /-nil.
  When the Near Past suffix /-if is followed by the back nasal-ng of the masculine
suffix 1-N/, and preceded by a back vowel u of the dummy 3rd A suffix, it is realised as
a high back vowel u due to assimilation (cf. Rule 13-7 below):      1-u/ (dummy 3rd A) +/-if (NRPAST) + 1-N/# -> -u-u-ng#
  The dual-paucal suffix /-nil is deleted if it is preceded by a Near Past suffix /-if,
which is further preceded by another vowel, in this case 1-u/ (Ru1e 13-11 ).      /-nil (DP) -> ~ IV- i- (NRPAST) _      (5) Near Past

    Medial verbal clauses often stand as separate sentences. 4 In some cases, the
controlling clause of such a medial clause exists in, or is easily recovered from, the
preceding or following sentence. For example,17-13         ongi              mono-ji-rii-juu.                    nii    mi-ko-ng.

              babies with me (and go)?' (XVI-26- 27)
In 17-13, the marked clause is immediately followed by the controlling clause nii
mi-ko-ng, which constitutes a separate sentence. 5 In 17-14, the unexpressed control-
ling clause of uko-opito, shown in the brackets, is easily recovered from the previous
sentence.
    However, there are cases where no obvious controlling clause exists or can be
recovered, and the theme of the discourse must be understood from the speech situa-

In 17-15, the dependent embedded clause tii haapi'-ku sets up the temporal framework
for the whole sentence. The perfect SS form pi-ro is controlled by tuujuu. The DS
marking of tuu-juu indicates that the state of the S referent of this verb 'our papa' is
contrasted with the main theme of the discourse, i.e. ""our (the narrator and her chil-
dren) waiting at home"", which is understood from the context.17-16       aat-opi-h                            piru=piruk-oro-mo                     toku-ko      tapa.

In 17-16, the overlapping referents of the twoS arguments, i.e. ""we two (the narrator
and her daughter)"" of aat-opih and ""she (the narrator's daughter)"" of piruk-oro-mo, are
parts of the thematic framework of the whole discourse. Thus both of them are marked
by the SS suffixes.
  The Continuous SS and DS forms, without explicit controlling clauses, are often
used to express the speaker's assertion that such states/durative events should continue

"
    The verbal morphology of Motuna is extremely complex. All the verbs mark the
person and number of core argument(s)- S, in the case of intransitive verbs, and 0 and
A, in the case of transitive verbs. They also distinguish active and middle voices,
similar to those found in classical Indo-Aryan languages. 7 A periphrastic agentless
passive construction is formed by participles and the auxiliary 'to become', which""is
mainly used when the speaker addresses or refers to someone in a special kin relation.
    Similar to many other Papuan languages, Motuna has ""medial"" verbs which usually
occupy sentence-medial positions and are marked by switch-reference morphemes.
The endings of fully inflected ""non-medial"" verbs, on the other hand, mark the gender
of the topical argument of the sentence.
    Motuna has an extensive tense/aspect/mood system. Non-medial verbs distinguish
fourteen tense/aspect/mood categories, while medial verbs distinguish three for the
same subject forms, and two for the different subject forms.
    As for derivational morphology, verb stems may undergo four valency-changing
processes--- stimulative, applicative, causative and reciprocal. They can also derive
verbal nouns and participles.",[34]

In 4-153a, taapu- 'to help' is a verb stem, while in 4-153b the reduplicated taa=taapu
'help' is a noun, expressing reciprocal activities. Note that reduplicated verb stems of
this type can take the verbal suffix -tuh, and then form reciprocal verb stems, as
mono=mono-tuh- in 4-153b. See §14.7.4-154       hoo         nommai tu 'ki tii-nohno                   ono=ono arap-ah                toku noi.

'the words (with similar contents) repeated by many people', expressing distributional

"
    As mentioned in §3.2.1, verbs consist of the following morphological elements.
1) verb stems,
2) bound morphemes which cross-reference the person and number of core
       argument(s),
3) tense/aspect/mood (hence TAM) suffixes, and
1 Note that ""medial verbs"" do not necessarily occupy the medial positions of sentences; they may
even stand as the heads of separate sentences, cf. § 17.1. Some ""non-medial verbs"", on the other hand,
may function as the heads of dependent embedded clauses, and in such cases they may occupy sentence-
medial positions.
2   Themes often coincide with the grammatical subjects (S or A) of the verbs, but not always, cf.
§ 17 .1. Although ""same/different theme"" are more appropriate labels than ""same/different subject"" for

"6.2.4     The Article with the Empatic Suffix /-ko/
    The article, either as a determiner or as NP head, may have special functions when
the emphatic particle /-koP is attached to it. In such cases, it may be used either
deictically or anaphorically. In deictic use, it refers to the entity outside the sphere of
both the speaker and the addressee. In anaphoric use, it singles out the entity which is
referred to in the preceding discourse. For example,6-22a         Tantanu-ki           roki        noh-u-r-u-ng:                   ""ho-ko             hiuo

              'Now they saw that clay pot filled with various kinds of food.' (III-42)
    Ho-ko in 6-22a is used deictically, pointing to the clay pot which is located outside
the reach of both Tantanu and the children. Ho-ko in 6-22b, on the other hand, is in
anaphoric use, singling out the clay pot just referred to. Note that the demonstrative
and article classifier constructions in juxtaposition, o-muu-ro ti-muu-ro in 6-22b,
denote distributional plurality. cf. § 10.3.3.4.6-23a        tii-ngoo                     koto     paruparu            kuhir-i- '-hee.

in 6-23a. Tii-ngoo in 6-23b functions as NP head; it can be interpreted either deictically
or anaphorically in this case.
    Ho-ko, as an impersonal pronoun with the emphatic suffix, is used to refer to a
situation or surroundings deictically:6-24         ho-ko         ehkong         muu=rii-ko-ng.

6.2.5 The Article Used Contrastively with the Demonstrative
  The demonstrative and the article contrast in deictic use, when they are accompanied
by LD nouns koho 'down' and koto 'up' (cf. §4.4.2.1). In such cases, the entity
referred to by the demonstrative is considered either spatially or temporally closer to the
speaker and the addressee than that referred to by the article.6-25         inokee-ko         ongo                koho      mii-kori        inokee-ko

In the following sentence, the speaker addresses his brother-in-law in dual form (cf.

              'Hey brother-in-law .... And with what could I help you? So you will just
              go downstream.' (V-17)
4.3 SEMANTIC CATEGORIES INDICATED BY CLASSIFIERS      Apart from the two obligatory grammatical categories discussed above, the semantic
categories of the referents of nouns may optionally be indicated by classifiers. The
categories expressed by classifiers include 'human', 'animate', 'long object', 'concave
object', 'taro', 'stone', 'human habitation', 'day', etc.
      Classifiers are always combined with various bound morphemes, or nouns or verbal
clauses. Classifier constructions thus formed may be juxtaposed to head nouns, may
be employed in headless noun phrases, or may function as NP heads by themselves. I
have attested fifty-one classifiers in my corpus and from elicitation.
      Some nouns can take two or more different classifiers in different contexts. For
example, the human noun nommai 'person/people', which is either masculine or
feminine, can take the 'human' classifier -uru, the 'animate' classifier -wori 'animate',
the 'lot' classifier -ngu and the 'group of people' classifier -po injuxtaposition: 109 The speaker could also use the paucal form po-owoi-naa (cf. 4-102c in §4.4.4.1.3) to address him,
and verbal forms with a paucal subject such as taapu-r-ong-hee, pi-'-hee.
111When an NP is determined by the demonstrative or the article, the classifier usually chooses the
bound form of the same determiner, as in 4-20. In such cases, the demonstrative functions either
deictically or anaphorically, and the article anaphorically. cf. Ch 6. However, it can take other
morphemes, e.g. the 'number one' numeral as in 4-21, which give additional information about the
entity referred to by the head noun. cf. Ch 8.

           ART.M     person      ART-CL.group
Note that the semantic category indicated by a classifier is never cross-referenced by
any other morpheme within or outside the NP. In the above examples, the inflection of
the determiner marks the gender of the noun nommai (masculine or feminine), and not
the semantic category specified by the classifier.
  Similarly, the noun moo 'coconut', which is either masculine or dimi,nv.tive, can
cooccur with five different classifiers: -ri 'nut with hard shells', - 'ri 'round object',
-mung 'plant/fruit' , -oita 'half, and mo' 'bunch of nuts'.4-21a      ong        moo        no-ri                   'this/that one coconut (nut with hard
           DEM.M      coconut    one-CL.nut              shells)'    b      ong        moo        no- 'ri                 'this/that one coconut (round object)'
           DEM.M      coconut    one-CL.round.object
    c      oi         moo        no-mung                 'this/that one (small) coconut
           DEM.DIM coconut       one-CL.fruit/plant      (fruit or tree)'    d      hoo        moo        no-ita                  'one half of a coconut shell'
           ART.M      coconut    one-CL.half
    e      tii        moo        no-mo'                  'one bunch of (small) coconuts'
           ART.DIM coconut       one-CL.bunch.of.nuts
Here again, the inflection of the determiner indicates the gender of the noun moo
(masculine or diminu.tive), and not the semantic category specified by the classifier.
  See Ch 8 for further examples and discussion.

4.4.1 Common Nouns
  Common nouns can be determined by the article and/or the demonstrative. Common
nouns can take any kinds of attributes such as adjectives, Possessors, relative clauses,
etc. (cf. Ch 10). Nouns in local and manner genders are not included in this class.","[103, 104, 105]"

             Medial verbal clauses typically function as dependent non-embedded clauses. Medial
         clauses with verbs in General DS or SS, however, may function as dependent embed-

         homonymous with the local noun tii-nohno 'that.time-length' (cf. §4.4.2.6).
            I regard them as subordinating conjunctions because the syntactic behaviour of medial clauses
         introduced by them diffe~from that of other medial clauses. The former always occupy the initial
         positions of sentences, and cannot stand as separate sentences on their own. (In this respect their
         behaviour is similar to that of protases in Imaginative. cf. 17-3.) The latter, on the other hand, can be
         placed after or within the controlling clauses, and can stand as separate sentences on their own. See the
         discussion below and in § 17 .2.
         3 This sentence has no controlling clause. The continuous SS form noh-u-i expresses a durative
         event going on at the reference point of time understood from the context. See the discussion of
         examples 17-15-17-17 below.
506                                                                                          Chapter 17  Dependent embedded clauses introduced by tii may also function as post-head
attributes:17-10         ngo-ng         rumaru tii        nii pehkita honnang-o-mo                nu-ku ---

              'My life when I was small and was growing up ---' (11-0)
  In most cases, however, medial verbal clauses function as dependent non-embedded
clauses. Switch-reference markings track the ""theme"" of the discourse (cf. Roberts
1988b).
  In Motuna, ""theme"" and ""topic"" are two distinct categories. As exemplified inCh 3,
""topic"" is a focal NP argument (usually in absolutive case) in a clause. In a verbal
clause it could be A, 0, S, or a local argument, and is cross-referenced by the gender
suffix on the non-medial verb. It does not control switch-reference operation.17-11         tiko tii       kongsi'-ko        poo'            patak-a-ro                manni

              nah-a-a-na: ""... ""
              say .to-30.3pcl.A-RMPAST-F
              'And after they had arrived at the underneath of the mango tree, they said
              to her: "" ... ""' (VIII-11)
In 17-11, the topic of the clause with the non-medial verb nah-a-a-na is the 0 argument
'her', which is cross-referenced by the feminine ending -na on the same verb. The
topic of the preceding medial verb patak-a-ro may be the S argument 'they' or the local
argument tii kongsi'-ko poo' 'at the underneath of the mango tree', neither of which is
coreferential with the topic of this controlling clause. If the topic were to control the
switch-reference operation, we would expect that this medial verb would be marked by
the DS suffix -ku. But in fact it is marked by the SS suffix -ro.
  As is shown in the above example, switch-reference is usually sensitive to the
coreference of SfA arguments, as in other Papuan languages, and not to the coreference
of clausal topics as defined above. However, there are also many instances where
medial verbs are in the same subject forms even though S/A are not coreferential. e.g.:17-12         tiko   hoo       oi         P.                  o-no-ori'                pee-mo

              return-MID.3S-PERF.SS    and. then        1-EMPH        certainly
              tini-mon-na.
              be.transferred-MID.lS.RMPAST-F
              'And P. and her sisters' father returned, and then, I was certainly trans
              ferred.' (XVI-40, cf.11-14)
Interclausal Relations                                                                                  507Here the referent of the S of turu-woo-ro (the narrator's husband) and that of the
controlling verb tini-mon-na (the narrator herself) are different. They are regarded,
however, as parts of the same referential framework which includes all the members of
the narrator's family living and moving together.
    It is clear from the above example that switch-reference does not operate within the
boundaries of a sentence, but is a thematic operation which essentially identifies the
frame of that particular discourse with that of the adjacent discourse. It is true that S/A
are the major components of such framework in that if they are the same or their
referents overlap, medial verbs are always in the same subject forms. But the spe3ker
can also regard different participants referred to by S/A arguments as belonging to the
same group for discourse reasons, as in 17-12.","[534, 535, 536]"

    As is shown in Diagram 13-4 and Table 13-5, S 0 suffixes are analysed as the
combinations of 0 (1-rnl, 1-r/ or zero) and the invariable (dummy) 3rd person A suffix
/-u/ in singular. 2 In dual number, and in paucallplural inclusive, they additionally take
the suffixes /-til and /-ru/, respectively, after 1-ul. Paucal/plural exclusive 0 suffixes
1-mor/ (1st) and /-ur/ (3rd) precede 1-ul. Note that inclusive/exclusive distinction exists
only in paucallplural number.
    The full paradigm of S 0 verb /kaah-/ 'to disagree/not to want', with all the TAM
suffixes listed in Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/feminine/dual-
paucal gender suffixes in Table 13-3, is discussed below. Note that the stem-final /h/ is
deleted before a consonant due to Rule 13-16 in § 13.4.1.","[314, 315]"

1  I will call these five TAM suffixes ""medial suffixes"" according to the convention of the grammati-
cal descriptions of other Papuan languages. Verbs marked by these suffixes do, however, not necessar-
ily occupy the medial position of a sentence; they may even stand as the heads of independent sen-
tences. cf. §17.1.

    THEIR INHERENT ASPECTUAL MEANINGS     Largely following Sasse (1990: 36), I categorise verbs in Motuna into four (or six)
classes according to their inherent aspectual meanings:
(1) ""totally stative"" verbs which express pure states, e.g. tu(h)- 'to be'
(2) ""inchoative stative"" verbs which express both states and their inception phases, e.g,,,
       haa- 'to agree/want'
(3) ""action"" verbs which express progressive events with their inception and termina-
       tion phases, e.g. konn- 'to walk/move'
(4) ""terminative"" verbs which express terminative events, e.g. hu(h)- 'to come'
     Note that Motuna has no ""totally terminative"" verbs (cf. Sasse 1991: 35-36). Action
verbs in class (3) may express events which last for a relatively long period, or just for
a moment. Events expressed by action verbs such as tokis- 'to cut' or ratik- 'to find'
are usually interpreted as punctual, but they may also express progressive events over a
certain duration of time in Present Progressive.
     Some verbs in class (3) can express both ""actions"" and ""states"". For example, hurir-
expresses the action 'to fly', but it also expresses the state 'to be in the air'. I will refer
to those verbs which express only actions as ""dynamic action"" verbs (3a), and those
which express both actions and states as ""action-state"" verbs (3b) hereafter.
     Similarly, some verbs in class (4) can express both ""terminative events"" and
""states"" .2 For example, it- expresses the terminative event 'to stand up', but it also
expresses the state 'to be standing'. I will refer to those verbs which express only
terminative events as ""dynamic terminative"" verbs (4a), and those which express both
terminative events and states as ""terminative-stative"" verbs (4b).
     Representative verb forms in each class are given below:       (1) totally stative verbs (full list):
             tu(h)- 'to be', tu(h)- 'Copula' 3
2 The states expressed by these verbs have not necessarily resulted from terminative actions. Forexample, Present Perfect of it- 'to stand up/be standing' can be used in the sense of '(a tree, a house,
etc.) is standing'.","[464, 465]"
"16.3.2.5       Participles Functioning Adverbially
  The following participles function adverbially in combination with NPs, nouns or
adverbials:tu'n-ah 'starting (from)-' derived from the intransitive verb tu'n- 'to begin (middle)'
(3a), and patak-ah 'till/up to -' derived from the intransitive verb patak- 'to arrive' (4a).
Tu'n-ah is used with an ablative NP, andpatak-ah with an absolutive local NP or a
locative NP:16-46         tiko impa          hoo-jori      monare no-roo'-no                     nau-nauk-arei

  The participle tang-ah, derived from the intransitive verb stem tong- 'to say/think',
also functions as a discourse marker. It occupies the second or third position in a,
sentence, usually after the sentential topic (see also 16-42).16-52      ana          tangah          iiro-nno                       ong        heewa tu 'ki

   The temporallaspectual scope of states denoted by participles may be indicated by the
TAM forms of the Copula tu(h)- .
   Participles with tu(h)- in Present express states which are going on for a certain

duration of time till the speech moment:

           'Is that possibly still hot?' (cf. 3-71)
  The Continuous form of tu(h)- simply expresses the continuation of a state referred
to by the participle:16-57      ... roki=manni          kirokowo          toko=tokoh-ah          tuu-juu.

           ' ... while it was still really very hot.' (XIII-34)16.3.4     Agentless Passive Construction
  Passives are formed by participles and the intransitive verb rii(h)- 'to become/be'.
Participles may be either transitive or intransitive.
  The whole construction describes a spontaneous action/event. One uses this con-
struction to avoid mentioning the central participant (the referent of S or A) of an event,
especially when such a participant is a parent/child-in-law, or a brother/sister-in-law, in
relation to the addressee, or to the speaker (if the referent of the unexpressed S/A is the
addressee). The unexpressed SorA is usually the Agent (as in 16-58 and 16-60), but
it could be the Experiencer as well (as in 16-59).

17.1     INTRODUCTION    According to the syntactic and pragmatic functions in interclausal relations, clauses in'J
Motuna are classified into independent and dependent clauses. There are two types of
dependent clauses --- those dependent at sentence level, and those dependent at supra-
sentence or discourse level. According to Foley and Van Valin's (1984: 238ff.)
terminology, I call the former ""dependent embedded"" and the latter ""dependent non-
embedded"" clauses respectively. Schematically,

                                   ""non-embedded""                       ""embedded""
    Independent clauses may stand alone as syntactically self-contained units. The
predicates of independent clauses may be verbs, nouns, or adjectives (cf. Ch 3). They
may optionally be combined with dependent clauses of either type.
    All the dependent non-embedded clauses are verbal clauses with medial verbs as their
heads. They can often stand as separate sentences, 1 but their dependency on the
discourse structure is overtly marked by switch-reference suffixes.
    Dependent embedded clauses are verbal clauses, whose heads are non-medial verbs1 The boundary between sentences is determined primarily by the existence of illocutionary force (cf.
Foley and VanValin 1984: 220-221), which is reflected in intonation patterns. In general, the end of a
declarative sentence is marked by a natural falling in pitch after the final stressed mora, with a
significant pause before another sentence starts. cf. §2.8. Sentences with verbs in Imperative, Definite
Future, and Continuous SS/DS (such as 17-1 b -c and 17-17) which express the speaker's commands or
assertions seem to be characterised by a steeper falling in pitch at the end than declarative sentences, but
this needs further investigation.
  There are cases where two or more independent clauses, with fully inflected non-medial verbs as
predicates, are uttered in one string. Unless such indepedent clauses are connected together by rii-ku (cf.
§7.2.3), I regard each clause as a separate sentence.
Interclausal Relations                                                                  503in most cases. They are subclassified into: (1) clauses filling the Complement slots of
verbal predicates, (2) adverbial clauses functioning as the peripheral arguments of
verbal predicates, (3) Possessor attributive/predicative clauses, and (4) relative clauses.
Medial verbal clauses may function as dependent embedded clauses only when they are
introduced by the conjunctions tii 'when' and tiinohno 'while, as soon as'. See 17-8
and 17-9 below.
  Verbal predicates in independent verbal clauses are always non-medial verbs.
Non-medial verbs may take one of the TAM suffixes discussed in § 15.3.1 - § 15.3.13.
They may or may not be marked by gender suffixes, depending on the types ofTAM
suffixes they take. Compare the following examples:17-1a      tii      uri       pi-heeta-na.       'You (F) will go to the village.'
           ART.L    village   go.2S-FUT-F
    b      tii      uri       pi-hee.            'You will definitely go to the village.'
           ART.L    village   go.2S-DEFFUT
    c      tii      uri       pee.               'Go to the village.'
           ART.L    village   go.2S-IMP
In 17-la, the Future form of the verb pi(h)- 'to go' is marked by the feminine suffix
-na. In 17-1 b and c, on the other hand, the verbal predicates are in Definite Future and
Imperative respectively, and they are not marked by gender suffixes.
  Note that verbs in Definite Future can be used either in independent or in dependent
embedded clauses, as discussed in § 15.3 .11. Compare the following sentence with
17-1b:17-2a      roo        hoo      ro-ong        mono-i-hee           haa-ru-i-na.

contour of /r/.

     I use three symbols to distinguish different types of morpheme boundaries:
       #                  a boundary between two grammatical words.
                          a boundary between two phonological words in a compound,
                          between a root and a prefixing reduplication, 25 or between a
                          verbal suffix derived from the existential verb tu(h)- 26 and a
                          morpheme preceding it.
                          a boundary between two bound roots, between a root and an
                          affix, or between two affixes.","[55, 56, 57]"

               CHAPTER 6 THE ARTICLE AND
                  THE DEMONSTRATIVE6.1   INTRODUCTION  Motuna has one article and one demonstrative, both of which can be used as the
determiner of an NP or as NP head. They have also bound forms, which are employed
with kinship roots and classifiers.
  The article is used as a determiner indicating the specificity of an NP, as a neutral
anaphoric or cataphoric pronoun, or as an impersonal pronoun ""it"" vaguely denoting a
situation or surroundings. It can be used deictically only when it is marked by the
emphatic suffix /-ko/, or is contrasted with the demonstrative with the help of the
locational-directional (LD) nouns koho 'down' and koto 'up'; in such cases it refers to
the entity outside the sphere of both the speaker and the addressee (which may be
translated as 'that over there').
  The demonstrative can be used either deictically or anaphorically. In the former case,
it refers to the entity located within the sphere of the speaker and the addressee (which
may be translated as 'this/that'). In the latter case, it is used to reintroduce a particular
entity, which is either intimately known to both the speaker and the addressee, or a
central topic in that particular discourse.","[163, 164, 165, 166]"

5 For example, the 1st person singular pronoun /ni/ is realised as [ni:] when it is not followed by any
suffix. In such a case it is represented as nii in orthographic representation. cf. §2.3.
6   Unless otherwise stated, original Tok Pisin words are taken from Mihalic (1971).

          1-   k -> [+labial] I u        o
Examples:
      kiuruko [kt(i)f(j)k w 0   r                'two (humans)'
      tuko [t(Ukw o]                             'ants' nest'
The phoneme /k/ may be realised as [!J] and UJ in certain morphophonemic environ-
ments. cf. Chs 4, 5 and 6.
    The archiphoneme /Q/, realised as a glottal stop[?], occurs word-medially before a
consonant, or word-finally, but never in word initial position. I will use the symbol '
for this phoneme in orthographic representation. e.g. /tuQkil tu'ki 'all', /moniQmo/
moni'mo 'woman', /kinaaQ/ kinaa' 'yesterday', limoQ/ imo' 'my relatives'.
    A glottal stop can also be non-phonemic when it occurs as an intervening consonant
between two vowels across a phonological word boundary""="", or across a grammati-
cal word boundary ""#"" if the grammatical words on both sides constitute a syntactically
tight unit. 8 See examples below. A non-phonemic glottal stop can also occur
between two vowels across a grammatical word boundary in rapid speech, or after a
vowel-final word when the speaker makes a deliberate pause (for hesitation, looking
for a next word, etc.).","[40, 41]"
