"6.1.7 The adverbial use of affirmative -pini
Affirmative -pini is a loan from Aymara where it expresses affirmation (Porterie-
Gutiérrez 1981:33If) and can be translated as 'truly' or 'for sure'. It is a clausal clitic
(cf. 7.2.3). Uchumataqu adopted these functions and affirmative -pini occurs in all
adverbial subclasses appearing regularly on adverbs expressing degree. With time
adverbs and adverbs of location and direction, we may assume that the marker
signals Affirmation, as demonstrated in example (27).

    Provided -kacu is an instance ofpredicator -kasi, example (17) is in contrast to this finding since it is
not an attributive predicate clause. No suitable explanation can be given

With manner adverbs and adverbs expressing degree, affirmative -pini marks an
increased degree In this function, it can be translated as 'very', 'really' or, even more
extended, 'enormously' (cf examples (14), (20), and (23))
(28)      luwa luwa           luwa-pim-cay

          'very quickly'      'very / really quickly'   (Vellard 1951 13)
Only in its affirmative function does affirmative -pint come close to what according
to Schachter (1985 20) signals the speaker's attitude towards the predication When it
occurs on manner adverbs or adverbs expressing degree, it looses this function and
becomes a mere way of increasing degree, which does not say anything about the
speaker's attitude
     With respect to word order, we find four possible positions the adverb can take
In most cases, it precedes the entire clause which may be regarded as the unmarked
position (pos 1) Another common and probably equally unmarked position is
preceding the verb, adverb, or adjective it modifies (pos 2) This position is in some
cases identical to the one preceding the entire clause The adverb can also appear at
the end of the clause which is less common than its position at the beginning (pos 3)
Accordingly, the adverb occurs sometimes after the item
it modifies although it does so less often (pos 4) Again, this position is in some
cases identical to the one following the entire clause In comparison to the position
preceding the modified item or entire clause, the position following it is possibly
marked in some way although it remains uncertain why or in what way it is marked
     There are only a few deviations from these positions We can only assume that
these deviations denote highly marked positions but it is impossible to provide
further explanations for the reason or meaning of these deviations6 2 Postpositions
In most languages, the distinction between case markers and adpositions is not
discreet one and the following definition is described as a ""[r]ule of thumb"" by Payne
(1997 100) However, I would like to adopt this definition for the following section
on postpositions
         Case marking is the morphosyntactic categorization of noun phrases that is
         imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase occurs Adpositions
         are free of such configurational constraints (Payne 1997 100)
Thus, adpositions may be seen as providing some additional semantic information on
the noun phrase they refer to and accordingly, are not required by verb semantics
     Adpositions in Uchumataqu are postpositions and some morphological features
help to clarify their status as postpositions To differing degrees, they are able to
combine with morphological markers other than clausal clitics which is not possible
for case markers In one case (see below), the postposition mora 'middle' follows a
case marker and it would be highly unusual for Uchumataqu to have two case markes
on one word In most case, a noun cames only one morphological marker (cf 3 2)
Only for huntani 'on, above' do we have to refer to Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino
260                      UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
2006:141) since the expression does not provide any hints to its status, i.e. it could be
a case marker as well. However, huntani 'on, above' can be equated with the Chipaya
postposition huni 'on, above' and thus, we may assume that huntani in Uchumataqu
is a postposition, too.
      In Uchumataqu, we find four postpositions which are huntani 'on, above', kesu
'close to', mora 'middle', and kos 'inside'. Each of these will be presented below.6.2.1 huntani 'on, above'
The postposition huntani 'on, above' does not combine with other markers except for
declarative -cay.
(29)      wes       huntani-cay potsi
          blanket on-DEC           knife
          'The knife is on the blanket.'                          (Uhle 1894:64)
It is possible that huntani consists of a stem *hun followed by locative marker -ta (cf.
4.1.1.4) and an element -ni. The latter may be in some way related to the subject
relativiser -ni but it is not the marker itself since locative -ta already is a nominal
suffix. However, the postposition huntani probably was lexicalised at the time of its
documentation and thus, has to be considered a lexeme.6.2.2 kesu 'close to '
The postposition kesu is translated as 'close to'.
(30)      oeisa    kesu       kuasi-cay
          sheep    close to water-DEC
          'The sheep is close to the water.'                      (Métraux 1935:105)
(31)      wat-cula         kesu-cay
          village-little close to-DEC
          'The little village is close.'                          (Muysken 2005:26)
It can be combined with predicator -kasi and declarative -cay. It is particularly
predicator -kasi that confirms the status of kesu as a postposition since a case marker
cannot appear in a predicative position, such as shown in example (32).
(32)      kesu-kaci-cay
          close tO-PRE-DEC
          'It is close.'                                          (Vellard 1951:14)6.2.3 mora 'middle'
The postposition mora means 'middle' and no example is found where it is combined
with other morphological markers. However, since huntani 'on, above' and kesu
'close to' can be combined with at least declarative -cay, we may assume that mora,
too, can be followed by clausal clitics.
CHAPTER 6 - ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS AND NEGATION                                                           261

            'In the middle of the village, there is a / the church.'              (Uhle 1894:68.2)
Although mora is a postposition, there is one case in which it precedes the noun it
refers to. It is uncertain whether this reversed order is highly marked or due to
language attrition.
(34)        mora     lyiksi-kina tsi:t-aki-cay
            middle road-DlR place-FU-DEC
            'We will place ourselves onto the middle of the road.' (Uhle 1894:17)
The following example confirms that mora is a postposition and not a case marker.
(35)        //' tapa        cufkij    xin-kinfaj ya-ki        maska-kifnaj mora
            this pepper we            stock-DlR put-TOP pot-DlR              middle
            'Let us put this pepper into the stock, into the pot in the middle.'
                                                                      (Métraux 1935:101)
As shown in the example clause, the form mora follows the directional case marker
-kina which would be impossible if mora itself was another case marker.6.2.4kos 'inside'
The last postposition to be discussed is kos 'inside'. With respect to morphology, kos
differs to a certain degree from the other postpositions in that it can be combined with
nominal markers, such as directional locative -ski and locative -ta. This is a proof that
kos indeed is postpositional in nature.
(36)        wir-i-l       kui     kos-ta                 ikan-s-n-a-cay

            'I will stay inside the house.'                                (Vellard 1967:30)
Postposition kos also combines with the form -carku '-wards' (cf. 6.1.2, and example
(10)).
(37)        kos-carku
            inside-AD
            'inside'                                                              (Métraux 1935:95)
In the following example, the meaning of kos is slightly changed to 'under'. This
becomes explicable if the table is viewed as a square with the legs forming its sides
and thus, building a closed space.

    The use of object marker -n is somewhat sinking here. It is possible that it reflects the locative object,
in the sense of 'stay in it (= house)'

Only in modem Uchumataqu does an allomorph josi592 occur. Since all other
documents represent the form as kos, I adopted this spelling.

The morpheme ana negates entire clauses as well as noun, verb, pronominal, and
adjectival phrases, i.e. it can occur with all parts of speech. It has several translations
depending on the context. According to the morphological markers or lexemes ana
can be combined with, four categories can be distinguished. They will be presented
below.
     The basic meaning of ana is 'no' or 'not' and in this function, the negation
appears either without any morphological marking at all (example 40) or combines
with clitic elements (41). However, in most cases, ana is not marked at all.
(40)        ana k""asi tun-n-aki-cay         tiks-n-aki-caysn
            NEG water come-OB2-FU-DEC die-OB2-FU-DEC
            'No water [= rain] will come, we will die.' (Vellard 1949:152)
(41)        tomxe-ki ana-l            t(a)xa-cay wir-ki
            today-TOP NEG-CL=1 sleep-DEC I-TOP
            'Today, I did not sleep.'594                (Uhle 1894:12b)
Declarative -cay is attached to the negation ana only as an exception.
(42)        ana-cay tuku          saki
            NEG-DEC yet           cold

With respect to its position, ana almost always precedes the element it negates, i.e. it
appears either at the beginning of the entire clause or precedes the phrase it refers to.
Sometimes the position at the beginning of a clause coincides with the one preceding
the negated phrase (e.g. example 40). Only in one case does ana appear at the end of
a clause and there, it is used to build a tag question. Since the construction in (43) is
the only one of this type found in the sources, it is impossible to state whether it is a

CHAPTER 6 - ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS AND NEGATION                                                        263
regular construction and what its exact meaning is. However, we may assume that the
position of ana is marked in some way in order to form the tag question.
(43)        kun kepck-aki ana(-cay)
            you retum-FU NEG(-DEC)
            'You (sg) will return, won't you?'                           (Métraux 1935:106)
When the negation is inflected with affirmative -pini, the meaning of ana extends to
'never', thereby reflecting the affirmative sense of -pini. Thus, -pini rules out the
basic meaning of ana. Affirmative -pini itself can be combined with declarative -cay.
(44)        ana    xuwa sels-cay ana-pini slekisini
            NEG    totora be-DEC NEG-AFF duck egg
            'There is no totora, [there are] never [again] duck eggs.'
                                                               (Vellard 1949:151)
In one instance, ana is inflected with certainty -kala (cf. 5.9) which takes a position
normally reserved for affirmative -pini since certainty -kala is a verbal and
affirmative -pini a clausal clitic.
(45)        kuya tax-cay sax-aki-cay ana-kala ci cuna
            house roof-DEC drip-FU-DEC NEG-CERT one good
            'It will drip from the roof of the house (lit: 'the roof of the house will
            drip'); it is [certainly] not good.'
            ('ku-ya tax-cay sax-r-kicay hana Kala c/'-cwna') (Vellard 1949:166)
Since affirmative -pini is a more recent loan from Aymara (Porterie-Gutiérrez
1981:331f), its occurence is limited to the works of Vellard (1949-67) and Muysken
(2005) (cf. 7.2.3). In all cases, the emphasised negative expression ana-pini- precedes
the item it refers to.
      So far, morphological processes have been discussed. The following will deal
with lexical processes involving negative morpheme ana. It can be combined with
indefinite pronouns in order to build negative indefinite pronouns595 (see 4.2.4). It
occurs with hek 'who' (only attested for Uhle 1894), culu or ci-culu 'something'596,
cila 'another', and the lexical expression ti suni 'this man'. Depending on the
indefinite pronoun, the resulting expression means either 'no one, nobody', 'nothing',
or 'not one'. Although negative ana can be inflected with clausal and personal clitics
(examples 46, 47), its scope is over the indefinite pronoun, i.e. an expression as e.g.
ana-pini hek means 'certainly no one' and not 'never one' (example mine). Thus, the
combination of ana and an indefinite pronoun rules out the meaning a clausal clitic
has on the negation on its own (example 47). The indefinite pronouns themselves can
take nominal or clausal clitics but in most cases they are not marked at all.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280]"
"595
    Uhle (1894'92.1) reports three instances where ana seems to be combined with the pronoun of
exhortative first person plural inclusive cukfij However, Uhle himself (1894.65) points out that in Irohito
no such combination exists and therefore, these uncertain instances will not be considered in the following
596
    Both hek 'who' and culu 'what' are in principle interrogative pronouns (see 4.2 5) but serve as
indefinite pronouns as well
264                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA

           NEG-AFF what lama-CL=2 kill-PST2-DEC
           'We [certainly] did not kill any lama.'597 (Vellard 1967:11)
Since negation ana and the indefinite pronoun form one expression, they hardly ever
split up. However, on a few rare occasions this is possible and we may assume that it
is highly marked in order to express e.g. emphasis.
(48)       qotsuni-pini ci waxlfaj-stani ana tox'sasm ci-cul
           Uru-AFF         one village-COM NEG other          what
           'The Uru have only one village (lit.: The Uru are with one village); there is
           not any other.'                             (Vellard 1967:18)
The overwhelming majority of negative indefinite pronouns appears at the beginning
of the entire clause, in one case, it immediately precedes the verb phrase it negates,
and example (48) is the only instance where the expression occurs at the end of the
clause. Thus, we may assume that example (48) is marked twice, i.e. the negative
indefinite pronoun occurs at the end and, furthermore, it is split up.
       In the last category to be discussed here, the negation ana is combined with
lexemes in order to express an antonymic relation. Since the resulting expressions are
found throughout the sources, they may be regarded as lexicalised. The following
combinations exist: ana cuni 'bad (lit.: 'not good')', ana ci cuni 'bad (lit.: 'not one
good')', ana cini 'mute (lit.: 'the one who does not speak')', and ana ep(-cic) 'orphan
(lit.: 'no father[-having]')'. At least for the paraphrastic expression ana cini 'mute'
exists a synthetic synonym which is cukcilai or chuxta, respectively (Polo 1901:473,
Muysken 2005:45).
(49)       ana aep-cic
           NEG father-POS

The negation ana can be inflected with personal (example 51) and clausal clitics,
such as declarative -cay (example 52) although in most cases it does not take
morphological marker at all (examples 49, 50).
(51)       ti-kfij     anas           cuni     oklai-cay

  Usually, toxsa serves an Uchumataqu name for the Aymara people, meaning 'the others' It is uncertain
why it is employed here instead ofcila 'another'
CHAPTER 6 - ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS AND NEGATION                                                 265(52)       ana-cay cum

In most cases, the lexemes that are combined with ana do not take further
morphological marking However, ep 'father' and cim 'speaker' are exceptional,
since they can be inflected with possessive -ci and subject relativiser -ni,
respectively
     With respect to word order, the lexical expressions have a tendency to appear
either at the beginning of the entire clause or to precede the item they refer to,
although this happens less often Only in two cases does the negative lexical
expression follow the negated phrase (examples 53) and both clauses are predicate
clauses
(53)       tara 9 ana-cay cum
           maize NEG-DEC good
           'The maize is bad '                                  (Métraux 1935 101)
Only in some exceptional cases does negation ana lose its final vowel In the works
of Vel lard (1949-67) and Muysken (2005) the negation is sometimes decnbed as
hana or jana, respectively This points to a fricative quality the initial sound may
have, similar to Aymara ham (ci Portene-Gutiérrez 1981 32) However, in the
majonty of all cases600, the negation is transenbed as ana and therefore, I adopted
this spelling here

7 CLAUSES
In what follows, I will describe the clause types Uchumataqu displays and the
morphological means by which they are marked. I will first discuss clausal and
personal clitics before turning to a description of clause types, including declarative,
imperative, and interrogative as well as predicate clauses. The final sections will be
concerned with the several types of complex clauses in Uchumataqu.","[280, 281, 282, 283, 284]"
"4 2 4 Indefinite Pronouns
In Uchumataqu the numeral ci 'one' also serves as the indefinite pronoun 'a' It is
used for human beings (94) and animals (95) alike.
(94)        cesku       ci sum pit-kala-cay
            yesterday one man come-CERT-DEC

The indefinite pronouns cila 'another' (96) and ci-culu 'somebody, -one' are derived
from ci The interrogative pronoun culu 'what' also serves as the basis for the
indefinite pronouns ci-culu or culu 'something' Negative indefinite pronouns are
built by adding the negation ana 'no, not' (98) to the expression, as ana ci-cul
'nobody, -one' (lif 'not somebody') (Vellard 1951 16) (cf 6 3).

Although the difference between ci-culu 'somebody, -one' and culu 'what' is clear-
cut according to Vellard (1967:25), the translation found in his works does not
always correspond to this distinction (cf. 98). However, in all other documents as
well as in the majority of Vellard's work, this distinction is upheld so that we can
propose the following hierarchy:
(99)       (ana) ci-culu           refers to     animate beings
           (ana) culu              refers to     non-animate objects.
Both Uhle (1894:58.2) and Métraux (1935:105) mention another indefinite pronoun
which is haqeltaqe or hakilta, respectively. It is translated as 'somebody, -one'413.
      In attributive position indefinite pronouns precede the head noun or subject they
modify (cf. 96). If the indefinite pronoun is used independently, i.e. without a
referent, it occurs in different positions in a clause. Since indefinite pronouns can
fulfil the function of a noun phrase they very often appear as the head of a phrase. As
such they are mostly placed at the beginning of the phrase they govern (100;
underlined -cay marks the end of a phrase). This phenomenon has also been observed
for Quechua (Cusihuamân 1976:112). However, if the indefinite pronoun does not
function as the head of a phrase, its position is not predictable but ruled by
considerations of topic and discourse.

Indefinite pronouns hardly ever take morphological markers. If there is
morphological marking we find comitative -stani attached to ci (30) as well as clausal
clitics such as declarative -cay or affirmative -pini. The form culu regularly takes
personal clitics (97, 101). Topic marker -ki appears on all indefinite pronouns.

    However, neither Uhle nor Métraux demonstrate a regular use of this pronoun and it is not found in
other documents on Uchumataqu. Furthermore, at least the element haqe seems to be a loan from Aymara,
meaning 'man, human being' The second clement -lta(q) may be related to Aymara take 'totality'
(DeLucca 1983:161, 397). For these aspects it will not be considered a regular pronoun of Uchumataqu

Uhle (1894) is the only one to report the use of the interrogative pronoun hek 'who'
in combination with the negative particle ana 'no, not' as a means to create the
indefinite pronoun ana hek 'nobody'.

               NEG-CL=3 who-ADD Want-IR-DEC
               'Nobody would want it [, either].'                                  (Uhle 1894:58.2)
No source other than Uhle mentions the form ana hek. It is possible that this was the
original expression, which became lost due to language attrition and was then
replaced by the periphrastic expression ana ci-culu. This assumption is supported by
the fact that with regard to interrogative pronouns a distinction is made between
human (hek 'who?') and non-human entities (culti 'what?'), which, however, is not
reflected (any more) in the system of indefinite pronouns as represented in sources
after Uhle. Since no further evidence for the use of hek as an indefinite pronoun is
available, 1 will not pursue this topic.
      It is in Uhle's and Vellard's data that we find an element -mi attached to the
pronouns hek 'who' (cf. 102, 103) and culu 'what'. Uhle reports four instances, one
of which is uncertain and (104) is the only example found in Vellard.

                'In a long time, thunder has not killed any of us [, either].'
The interpretation of -mi is not entirely certain, but I would like to point to Cerrón-
Palomino (2006:177, 178), who interpreted an identical suffix for Chipaya as being
additive. According to the author, additive -mi is attached to indefinite pronouns and
on a clausal level conveys the notion of adding something or someone to (a)
person(s) or object(s) mentioned before. Cerrón-Palomino suggests a translation as
'also; too'. I would like to adopt Cerrón-Palomino's interpretation of -mi as an
additive marker (ADD). However, in Uchumataqu, additive -mi appears to be
restricted to pronouns and does not occur on other parts of speech and I will therefore
not adopt its interpretation as a clausal marker but rather analyse it as a pronominal
marker without sentential scope. Its interpretation and translation is reflected in
(102), (103), and (104) by adding 'either' (due to the use of negation ana) to the
reading provided by the sources. The additive marker -mi is formally identical to the
Quechua declarative marker and it is possible that its use in Uchumataqu and
Chipaya has been inspired by it, particularly with respect to the clausal value ascribed416
    Given the original translation by Uhle, an interpretation of-i as subject marker (cf. 5 4 2) is possible
417
    For the additive element -mi, cf. below.

to it by Cerrón-Palomino. However, its usage as a marker of addition rather than of
assertion differs notably from Quechua and if the latter indeed had inspired the
Uchumataqu / Chipaya marker, we may assume that this is not a recent development.
Uchumataqu hardly makes any use of additive -mi and, as mentioned above, the are

"1.1 Structural overview of the Uchumataqu language
Together with closely related Chipaya (cf. 1.1.2), Uchumataqu forms the language
family of Uru-Chipaya, which is assumed to be isolated (cf. Torero 2002:466,
Muysken 2001:76). The following summary of the linguistic structure of
Uchumataqu is based on my research and the features addressed here will be further
outlined in chapters 2 to 7.
       Uchumataqu phonology differs in some aspects from that of the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Just like these languages Uchumataqu has a rather
elaborate set of plosives. However, these include aspirated, glottalised, and labialised
plosives, and word initial plosive clusters, something that cannot be observed for
Quechua or Aymara. Furthermore, Uchumataqu has some affricates and fricatives,
which do not occur in its neighbouring languages, either, such as dental voiceless
affricate /ts/ or postalveolar voiceless fricative [J]1. Another distinctive feature of
Uchumataqu phonology is the 5-vowel system with a long variant of each vowel.
However, increasing influence of Aymara (with a 3-vowel system) caused the
attrition of the 5-vowel system, as can be observed in later studies on Uchumataqu
(e.g. Vellard 1967). The tendency of Uchumataqu to allow consonant clusters is also
reflected in its syllable structure, where a syllable can have the form of CVCC or
    Which does not have phonemic status.
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                              3
CCVC. However, the most common forms are CV or CVC. With respect to stress we
find that Uchumataqu has a tendency to place stress on the penultimate syllable,
although this is not compulsory and there are exceptions from this, particularly when
a bisyllabic stem is inflected with a bisyllabic suffix or a mono- or bisyllabic verb is
inflected with first person singular markers -u or -a.
      The elision of final vowels (or in some cases the deletion of the last syllable)
does not have morphological meaning in Uchumataqu, i.e. kuy' 'house' does not
denote a direct object or any other grammatical relation, although the full form would
be kuya. I therefore call these processes context-sensitive instead of
morphophonological. The context-sensitive processes comprise mainly final vowel
elision and to a lesser degree elision of consonants. In order to prevent elision, the
dummy elements -i and -u are used. Uchumataqu has a certain tendency towards
metathesis, which occurs with the present tense habitual marker -in that is
metathesised to -ni, related state adjectival marker -tni to -tin, and the locative
markers -kis and -fa/' and their allophones -ski and -siki which are built by metathesis
      Uchumataqu distinguishes three major parts of speech, which are nouns,
adjectives and verbs. There is no morphological device that distinguishes particles as
a separate class and the only particle that occurs frequently is the negation particle
ana 'no, not'. Adverbs can be subsumed under either nouns or adjectives. The latter
are distinguished by the use of predicator -kasi and form an open class in
Uchumataqu. Morphological processes of Uchumataqu are primarily compounding,
only marginally noun incorporation and reduplication. Uchumataqu compounds
consist of a nominal head and a modifier, which can be another noun, an adjective, or
an adverb; the resulting compounds are endocentric or exocentric, although the latter
is exceptional. Compounding is a productive process in Uchumataqu and occurs
mainly with kinship terms and body parts. Noun incorporation, however, is hardly
ever used in Uchumataqu and the few examples found could be analysed differently.
Reduplication is another productive morphological process of Uchumataqu and
occurs with all parts of speech and can be partial or complete. With verbs,
reduplication mainly intensifies the meaning of the verb stem, while reduplicated
adjectives and nouns are augmentative or, in the case of nouns, express plurality.
Reduplication of grammatical material is mainly restricted to possessive marking -ci.
      Although Uchumataqu is an agglutinative language, the average number of
affixes per word is low: nouns and pronouns tend to carry only one affix, while
adjectives and adverbs are often zero marked or have at best one bound morpheme.
This also holds for particles and numerals. Only verbs have a tendency to carry two
morphological morphemes, and verbs with three or four affixes attached are
exceptional. Uchumataqu differs from Aymara and Quechua by the low number of
affixes that occur on a stem.
      Uchumataqu employs mainly suffixes, but it also has two prefixes, one of which
is lexicalised. The case marking system of Uchumataqu resembles that of Aymara
and Quechua with the exception of locative marking devices, where we find the
directional locative -kis (and its metathesised allomorph -ski), locative marker -ksi
(and the allomorph -siki) as well as yet another locative marker -ta. The latter
contrasts with locative -ksi I -siki since the form -ta does not occur with stative or
4                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
position verbs or in locational predicate clauses. Uchumataqu has six personal
pronouns, which also occur in possession marking and only for the first person
singular does a specially marked form exist: wist 'my'. However, it is likely that at
least the third person plural pronoun ninaka 'they' has been inspired by Aymara, with
which it shares plural marker -naka. This appears to be a recent development since
sources until Métraux (1935) still report the use of an ancient pronominal plural
marker -wici. Similar considerations could be applied to the pronoun of first person
plural exclusive wisnaka, which is clearly derived from first person singular wir 'Γ
and -naka, although no combination of wir with -wici occurs. Another peculiarity of
Uchumataqu's pronominal system is the form kun, which appears to be the pronoun
of second person singular and is preferrably applied in interrogative clauses, although
it occurs in sentence types too. Its function and meaning is not fully understood.
      Uchumataqu has four postpositions, one of which, kos 'inside', can be inflected
with nominal locative marker -ta.
      As in the majority of South American languages, the verbal system of
Uchumataqu is rather complex, although some of its aspects can be described only
vaguely due to the incomplete sources and the progressive attrition of Uchumataqu
reflected in them. In the verbal system the two prefixes mentioned above can be
observed. The marker s- appears to have been still productive at the time of
documentation and marks a first person singular as object. The second prefix ke-
indicating 'return' had already been lexicalised on kepic- 'return' when Uchumataqu
was documented. However, the use of prefixes is exceptional among the Andean
languages. Uchumataqu has a tense system, which primarily distinguishes future /
non-future, although there are markers for past, present and future tense. Only a first
singular is clearly indicated in present and future tense by the markers -u and -a.
There are no bound morphemes for any other person, with the exception of In-Group
marker -acu referring to first plural inclusive, which, however, may have an aspectual
quality. Only a few aspectual suffixes are found in the sources, probably due to the
circumstances of data collection and the increasing attrition of Uchumataqu. Other
verbal markers are nominalising -ni and -s(i), two subordination markers, of which
only gerund -ku can be satisfactorily interpreted, and irrealis -aca, which fulfills
several functions, such as marking conditional or Deontic modality.
     The general order of verbal affixes is that grammatical function marking affixes,
aspectual suffixes, subordinating and switch reference marking suffixes, the valence
changing suffix as well as nominalising and adjectival state marking suffixes cluster
around the verb stem. These suffixes appear to be mutually exclusive. They can be
followed by the validational suffix -kala, which is a verbal suffix. Mood, modality,
and portmanteau suffixes expressing tense and person are the last verbal suffixes to
be attached. Verbs can take one or two of the clausal clitics -pini, -ki, or -cay2, which
themselves can be followed by one of the personal clitics -/, -tn, or -s.
     On a clausal level, Uchumataqu has the following clitics: declarative -cay, topic
marker -ki, and affirmative -pini3. Another peculiarity of Uchumataqu is the use of
2
    Affirmative -pini and declarative -cay can be combined.

    Which is a more recent loan from Aymara.
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                      5
the personal clitics -/, -m, and -s, which refer to first, second, and third person,
respectively. Although their usage in the sources appears to be mainly emphatic,
there are also hints that these clitics had a person marking function in a more intact
stage of Uchumataqu. This is particularly reflected in interrogative and imperative
clauses. Uchumataqu is predominantly an SOV language but it allows great variation
with respect to word order. Interrogative devices are the interrogative pronouns and
the use of question markers -ta and -xwi; the latter is an allomorph of topic marker -ki
used in questions. In most cases, declarative -cay does not occur in interrogative
clauses, although there are some yes / no questions in which it is used. Although the
number of relative clauses is severely limited in my data, it appears that they are built
with nominalising subject relativiser -ni and are prenominai in nature, corresponding
to the basic SOV word order. The available examples suggest that relativisation in
Uchumataqu is restricted to subjects.","[19, 20, 21, 22]"

                 'Yes'                                                (Vellard 1949 159)
In contrast to modem Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino 2006 109), which uses hee-za to
express positive confirmation, the sources on Uchumataqu (including Vellard) agree
on that the notion 'yes' is expressed by repetition of the verb form (cf 113a and b)
(113) a          kun tam
                 you take
                 'Did you (sg) catch [itp'

                 '[Yes,] I caught it '                                (Vellard 1949 158)
Although the Uchumataqu form hi-lay shows considerable similanty to its Chipaya
equivalent, it remains largely uncertain whether hi-lay is a regular form, under which
314
      Uchumataqu forms alphabetically ordered Slashes denote alternative forms
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                    161
circumstances it could be used, and what the difference is between hi-lay and
repetition of the verb form.
      Next is isu-cay 'so, that' (Vellard 1949:151), which is probably a loan from
Spanish eso 'this, that' (cf. 2.11) and thus, we do not know whether the form ka:ya-
ca: (Uhle 1894:2) represents the original Uchumataqu expression. Furthermore, Uhle
did not specify whether this item is from Chipaya or Uchumataqu.
      Likewise uncertain is the use of sipi 'when, if, as given by Polo (1901:476).
Notions of mood and modality are usually expressed by irrealis -aca (cf. 5.8.2) and
thus, the use of a presumably unbound morpheme such as sipi appears to be striking.
It is possible that the first part is a loan from Spanish si meaning 'when, if335 but in
this case, the second element *-pi remains unanalysable. I would like to point to
Cuzco Quechua where a similar phenomenon can be observed. In this dialect,
Spanish si in its meaning 'when, if is combined with -chus which itself consists of
negation and question marking -chu and Reportative -s(i) (Cusihuamân 1976:248).
The resulting form sichus is likewise translated as 'when, if (cf. Valderrama and
Escalante 1977, Hannß 2004). However, since sipi is a single instance and its second
component remains elusive nothing further can be said about it.
      Another element to be discussed is somewhat exceptional to the previous ones
since wajasiki23*' 'that's why' comprises a form -siki which can be analysed as the
locative marker (cf. 4.1.1.3). The element *waja- does not occur elsewhere and we
may assume that wajasiki is lexicalised, provided it is a regular form of Uchumataqu
at all.
      Finally, Uhle (1894:113, 54.1) presents two particles related to Aymara. The
expression winaya 'always' is a direct loan from Aymara337 (DeLucca 1983:853)
while waligara, which is translated by Uhle as 'like'338, comprises the form wali
meaning 'well' or 'much' (DeLucca 1983:444). The form wali itself is used as an
adverb in Uchumataqu (cf. 6.1.4) but the element *-gara cannot be established for
neither Aymara nor Uchumataqu. The notion of comparative 'like' is expressed in
Aymara by the bound grammatical morpheme -jama (DeLucca 1983:606), whereas
Uchumataqu uses separative -kistana. Therefore, the form waligara remains largely
unanalysable. The remaining forms do not show any peculiarities or relations to other
bound or free morphemes.
      In what follows, I do not interpret the term 'phrase' in its syntactic sense but
rather in a pragmatic way, i.e. as a fixed expression that serves in daily
communication. As such, these phrases form a closed set. They are not a part of
speech as are e.g. adjectives but neither do they belong to a particular clause type (cf.
chapter 7) for they are fixed and do not allow much morphological or syntactic
variation. Therefore, these expressions are treated as a final remark on the parts of
speech Uchumataqu comprises.
      The majority of these phrases comes from Vellard (1949, 1951) and is thus
subject to the same source-related restrictions as are particles. Some of the phrases  It can also mean 'yes'
  As a quotation, the form waja- is maintained and not adopted to the Irohito alphabet
  Uhle points to this.
  Likewise for not specified for its origin Uhle himself is doubtful about the meaning of waligara.

cannot be analysed and most may be regarded as lexicalised. Furthermore, we lack a
context to these phrases and therefore, it remains largely unclear how they were used.
Taking this into consideration the following will be restricted to a mere presentation
of phrases and discussion will concern only some general features and observations.

Table 3.6: Uchumataqu phrases of daily communication
  Vellard (1949· 182) equated this form with monsieur 'mister, sir'
  See also the polite toast reported by Vellard 1949
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                        163
Some of these phrases are clearly analysable, e.g. ok^acay 'I will go' and in response
cunukasiì4ì 'alright' (Vellard 1951:20). Others can be understood only in part. This is
the case with e.g. cuni luxkucay wat cay 'thank you (for the meal)' (Vellard 1951:20)
where cuni luxkucay means 'I ate well' but the expression wat'cay remains elusive
(cf. Muysken 2005). The same is true for 'good evening' which is expressed as
sequese sincilita (Polo 1901:479). The first element sequese is reminiscent of the
word for 'evening' sericai or seheri (Polo 1901:476) but the form sincilita remains
uncertain342. Other forms that cannot be explained are kuntinsw, kal tinskucay, kam-
tun, and wa.ntuncay. It is possible that tun- of kam-tun and wa.ntuncay is related to
the verb stem tuna- or tona- meaning 'to come'. Provided these expressions are
indeed part of the Uchumataqu register of phrases, well-wishes, and greetings, it is
likely that they are lexicalised.
     The element -ay or -lay344 occurs on the respectful address for a superior person
appay or apây 'father', on epalai145 'good day', on cicalay used to greet a brother or
a person of equal rank. It may have inspired the interjection hay 'oh', as in hay
happay 'oh, father' (Vellard 1951:19) in response to happay. If the element -ay or
-lay has ever been a suffix of Uchumataqu it was not productive any more at the time
of documentation and it does not occur elsewhere. Although its exact meaning
therefore has to remain uncertain it seems justified to propose that it conveys the idea
of a respectful and polite address when attached to kinship terms. These terms, then,
may be considered to be an appropriate way of expressing politeness and respect
when dealing with a person one is not related to.
      Finally, the greeting exchanged between husband and wife should be mentioned.
The husband greets his wife with tun'una atto (Vellard 1951:20) which itself is not
translated by Vellard. The first element tun 'una shows considerable similarity with
the verb ton- 'to come' (Métraux 1935:109)346 while the second element atto is a
kinship term meaning 'mother'. In response the wife replies with wa.ntuncay apay
341
    The change of/i/ to /u/ on curnt- cannot be explained
342
    Métraux points to the similarity between the expression for 'good evening' and the word for 'evening'
sese.
343
    The element kun could be a form of second person singular. For further dicussion, cf. 4 2.5 1.1
344
    See also Polo (1901 481) who points out that male kinship terms end in -at
345
    Although Métraux translated this expression as 'good day' it is likely that it means the same as happay,
i e. 'father' in respectfully addressing a person of higher rank, epalai shows considerable similarity to the
kinship term ep '(biological) father'.
346
    Vellard does not mention the use of the verb ton- 'to come'
164                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
where wa.ntun- remains largely inexplicable except for the element -tun- which again
is reminiscent of'to come'. The term apay means 'father' as outlined above. That is,
the kinship terms of 'father' and 'mother' are used between husband and wife in
order to express politeness and respect347. This consideration gives further support to
the assumption that with respect to pragmatics kinship terms function as a polite
means to address people of equal or higher social rank. Thus, they have a scope
beyond the simple denotation of relationship.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]"
"7.2.3 Affirmative -pini
Affirmative -pini is a recent loan from Aymara since this marker is testified for
Uchumataqu only in Vellard's (1949-67) and Muysken's (2005) data617. In Aymara,
it is emphatic and best translated as 'truly' (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981:331). However,
in Uchumataqu its meaning depends on the part of speech it is attached to, ranging
from purely affirmative to increasing degree.
      With nouns and pronouns, the meaning of affirmative -pini is purely affirmative
and is translated as 'truly, for sure'. It can be regarded as a direct loan from Aymara.
(20)           culfuj kustak-pini-ki
               what olderbrother-TOP
               'Which one is the [truly] older brother?'                (Vellard 1967:24)
The translations offered in the sources suggest that with negation ana, affirmative
-pini is either affirmative (21) or increases its degree to 'never' (22).
(21)           ana-pini sek-cay
               NEG-AFF be-DEC
               'There is [truly] not much.'
               (Wo es mucho. (No hay mucho de e5o/) 618 (Vellard 1967:21)617
      With the exception of one possibly lexicalised expression found in Métraux (1935:108).
618
      The original translation is added to indicate that the researcher understood ana-pirn as affirmative and
274                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
(22)        wilk cip     ana-pini piks-cay

            ' My sister never comes. '                                (Muysken 2005:28)
However, the by far most common use of affirmative -pini is with adjectives or
adverbs where it marks increased degree (cf. 6.1), meaning 'much', 'many' or 'very'.
(23)        yuk-pini    xala-kfij  wir-takfi]
            much-AFF lama-TOP I-BEN
            ' I have many, many lamas. '                              (Vellard 1967:16)(24)        untu-pini k 'au-k 'awa-aca-cay
            hard-AFF cry-cry-lR-DEC
            '(S)he [probably] cries very hard.' 619                   (Vellard 1951:24)
Thus, the most central meaning of Aymara -pini, namely marking affirmation, is
extended in Uchumataqu to the notion of expressing increased degree. Apart from
this, -pini occurs in the lexicalised expression of xospini 'almost' and Vellard
(1951:21) reports that cun[i] cip-pini (lit.: 'most beautiful sister') is given as a pet
name to a beloved woman. Affirmative -pini does not appear on verbs where its slot
is taken by certainty -kala (cf. 5.9). Thus, these elements occur in complementary
distribution. Only in one and not entirely certain case is affirmative -pini shortened to
-pin ', otherwise it always keeps its final vowel.","[290, 291]"

1 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE UCHUMATAQU LANGUAGE
AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDYUchumataqu, also known as Uru, was spoken around Lake Titicaca in the
communities of Irohito (northwestern Bolivia), Ch'imu (southeastern Peru), and in
the Bay of Puno (Peru) It is assumed that in pre-colomal times there has been an
Uru-speaking population all along the nvers of the Bolivian Altipiano and at the great
lakes Titicaca, Ροορό and Coipasa Wachtel (1986 283) named this stretch the
""aquatic axis"" Adapting to this environment, the Uru based their economy on
hunting, fishing, and gathering However, it is likely that the Uru already became
dispersed under Inca rule and matters did not improve for the Uru population when
the Spanish arrived In fact, they were forced to leave their traditional communities,
abandon their lifestyle and settle down in Aymara villages By this process, the
community of Irohito became isolated and what could be called one of 'the last
stands' of Uru culture and language Despite less favourable social, economic, and
political circumstances, the small village of Irohito managed to survive and even
maintained its language Uchumataqu Although the Uru, their particular culture and
language had been known since early colonial times, they were not documented
before 1894, when Max Uhle paid a visit to Irohito and for the first time collected
linguistic data Irohito soon became a kind of scientific hot spot (Muysken m s
2007 4) and during the first half of the 20th century, the village was visited by a
number of researchers, who recorded Uchumataqu However, a severe drought at the
beginning of the 1940's brought the end to Irohito, and Uchumataqu became extinct
around 1950 However, Irohito recovered and survived as a settlement Today, there
is a certain pnde of the inhabitants about their distinct culture Although the language
has been extinct for about half a century by now and only the knowledge of some
words and phrases remains, the Uru are aware of their ancient language, which, still,
contnbutes to the Urns' view of themselves as being different from all their
neighbours
      This study is based on the efforts and results of the early researchers, who
worked in Irohito and on Uchumataqu between 1894 and 1967 Although a
considerable amount of research had been conducted during this time, only few
studies were actually published and none brought together what had been said on
Uchumataqu Therefore, the aim of this book is to provide a grammatical description
of Uchumataqu, taking into consideration every study, published or unpublished, that
is concerned with linguistic data on Uchumataqu It seeks to give an impression of
this language and its phonological, morphological, and syntactic processes and to
provide linguists from different backgrounds with a reference grammar on this so far
minimally described language Working with (in part) historic material on a language
that is not acquired by anyone any more as native language involves a certain degree
of reconstruction and makes necessary more assumptions and incertainties than
would have been the case with a language that is still spoken However, this study is
not a reconstruction in the sense that it tries to reconstruct a proto-language or the
kind of Uchumataqu that was spoken 500 years ago Rather, its purpose is to describe
the language as it has been recorded during the last 50 years of its existence and is
2                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
thus a description of a highly endangered language, which, became extinct two
generations ago. It cannot be denied that material from different researchers with
different backgrounds and recorded at different stages of the language, adds new
problems to the already existing challenge of describing a dying language. Thus, in
some cases our knowledge of certain phenomena remains limited since the data do
not provide solutions and there are no native speakers left to answer questions.
      To give a more detailed outline of Uchumataqu, its speakers and the research on
which the present study is based, this chapter will sketch the structure of Uchumataqu
and its differences and similarities with closely related Chipaya, before giving an
overview of the Spanish, Quechua, and Aymara influences on this language. That
will be followed by a description of the history of Irohito, its development during the
20th century, and its position at the beginning of the 21 st century, including a sketch
on the field-work I conducted in Irohito. Before turning to detailed presentation of
the sources considered here, I will comment on the theoretical framework applied for
the current study and the resulting terminology and methodology.
      This introductory chapter will be followed by a description of the phonology of
Uchumataqu and its morphophonological processes in chapter 2, which I call
context-sensitive processes. Chapter 3 describes the morphological patterns that can
be observed in Uchumataqu. Then I turn to a description of the nominal system in
chapter 4. Chapter 5 concerns a presentation of the verbal system of Uchumataqu.
The following chapter 6 deals with adverbs, postpositions, and the negation particle
ana. The final chapter of this book provides a description of the clause types and
syntactic operations of Uchumataqu. The appendices contain a comparative
dictionary and transcriptions of Uhle's and Lehmann's manuscripts of Uchumataqu.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

Benefactive -taki in Uchumataqu is a loan from Aymara where it marks beneficiary
too; but in this function it is limited to human beings. Additionally, it also indicates a
purpose or an objective; in both these functions -taki is translated as 'for'.
      Uchumataqu adopted only the benefactive function with human beings, that is to
say: the most typical meaning of benefactive -taki. Its other function in Uchumataqu,
namely to build possessive predicate clauses like 'For me exist(s)...' is not described
for Aymara377. This use of-taki seems to be a re-interpretation extended on the basis
of its most typical meaning378.

4.1.2.3 Purpose       -xapa
The nominal morpheme -xapa belongs to the case marking system of Uchumataqu
and marks purpose (PUR). It can be regarded as the counterpart to benefactive -taki
which expresses beneficiary and possession (see section 4.1.2.2) while -xapa is
restricted to marking purpose379. It is attached to verbs nominalised by infinitive -5
(45) and possibly subject relativiser -ni (see below) and nouns (46), and although
Uhle (1894) also says it is used on pronouns, no such example is available for
Uchumataqu380.
      It is to note that Vellard (1967:27) interpreted the form, which he spells -
srapam, as being verbal382. This interpretation becomes explicable if one considers
that purpose -xapa can be attached only to a nominalised verb form. The element /δ/
    Aymara also builds possessive clauses by using the verb utxa 'exist' but it does not employ benefactive
-taki in such constructions (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981154f)
378
    Uhle (1894) presents one instance in which sel- 'exist' and benefactive -laki are used to express
obligation 'It is ours to leave the house.'. This clause is built in the way possessive predicate clauses are
but clearly marks obligation. This is the only example for this usage and is considered to be exceptional.
379
    This is in contrast with Aymara and Quechua where the benefactive markers -taki and -paq,
respectively, fulfil both functions
3 0
 "" However, for Uchumataqu, Uhle (1894:52.1) mentions the interrogative pronoun cui-xapa 'for whaf'
but it occurs only as a single item, i.e. outside a clause and without further context No other researcher
notes the use of cul-xapa
381
    On some occasions also represented as -srapa.
382
    In contrast to this, Vellard (1949:177) stated that the form could be attached to nouns, verbs, and
adjectives alike.
178                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
or Isl in Vellard's inteipretation reflects the obligatory use of action nominaliser -s
before purpose -xapa. Since the form -xapa appears almost exclusively with the
action nominaliser -5 (cf. 45), Vellard (ibid.) apparently analysed Isl (or /s/) as being
part of the morpheme and therefore considered it a verbal element. However, a
problem in Vellard's data is that the form -srapa also appears twice on nouns, i.e. on
forms that do not require a nominalising morpheme. We can only assume that
Vellard, after he had analysed the form as -srapa, decided to analyse it as such in
every context, i.e. even on nouns, as in (46).(45)        haske-l         ox-cay       ma:-ki             kona      tuki    ana

            'The mother goes far away before she runs dry, for [the child] not
            remembering the breast [= being breastfed], for forgetting it.' 384
                                                              (Vellard 1967:18)
(46)        xuwa           cukfij    s-tax-cay             kau-s-xapa

            ('totora allons placer bord pour.')                 (Vellard 1949:155)
There is no special form indicating negative purpose. Instead it is expressed by the
negative particle ana 'no, not' preceding the element marked by -xapa (cf. 45).
     As demonstrated above, purpose -xapa can be preceded by action nominaliser -s
which itself can be preceded by verbal markers, such as object marker -n or habitual
present tense marker -in I -ni.

                                                              (Uhle 1894:96.1)
However, there is only weak evidence for purpose -xapa being also preceded by
subject relativiser -ni (for purposive meaning of -ni, cf. 5.6.1) The following is the
only suitable example for this kind of usage.

    The element -/ cannot be explained.
!W

    The element -sxi cannot be explained but it is possible that it constitutes a clitic element of third person
•j followed by an epenthetic vowel

If purpose -xapa is not preceded by either of the elements mentioned above, it is
attached to the noun stem and not followed by other elements. As an oblique case
marker, -xapa is not selected by semantics and does not occur with any particular
verb construction. In contrast to benefactive -taki, -xapa has no alternative forms386.","[193, 194, 195, 196]"
"  In case the morpheme combination -acaki is analysed as consisting of irrealis -ac(a) and future tense
marker -aki As pointed out above, this is the least probable solution
CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEM                                                                                 247
5.8.2.6 General remarks on Irrealis -aca
Uhle (1894:92.1) reports a suffix -txani or -xani, which serves to build a subordinate
conditional clause. The matrix clause can be either a declarative clause (125), or
another conditional clause (126).
(125)           ep-i-s              pis-txani    lul-aki-cay
                father-LV-CL=3553 come-COND eat-FU-DEC
                'If the father comes, we will eat.'                             (Uhle 1894:92.1)
(126)           cix-in-xani         cqal[a]-aca-cay
                rain-HP-COND SOW-IR-DEC
                'If it had rained, we would sow.'554                            (Uhle 1894:92.1)
It is only in Uhle's data that the form -(t)xani occurs and its meaning is not entirely
clear. Aymara has a simple past marker -ja (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981:244-55, 404),
but it is unlikely that this form would be employed here. Although the element -ni is
reminiscent of the Uchumataqu Nominaliser, it seems highly improbable that it is
used here. Thus it is likely that -txani is a genuine suffix of Uchumataqu used to
express a condition.
      Another special case is in Vellard (1951, 1967), where in four instances the form
-aca is translated as marking an habitual and / or a repeated action.
(127)           ni       k'au-k'awa-aca-cay
                (s)he cry-cry-lR-DEC
                '(S)he usually cries a lot.'                    (Vellard 1951:24)
                ('/Va l'habitude de beaucoup crier (forme de répétition)')
Since the form is grammatically correct we can only assume that there must have
been a misunderstanding between the involved language consultant, the interpreter,
and the researcher. What this misunderstanding might have been remains uncertain.
     Negative irrealis is expressed by placing negation ana before the expression or
clause containing irrealis -aca (cf. example 113).

Irrealis -aca is not restricted to a particular verb class and does not require a
particular person marking. The majority of clauses contains a subject or subject
pronoun but another group of clauses does not show any person reference. Only in
two cases person is indicated in the verb and clitic elements support person reference.
     The form -aca is sometimes shortened to -ca. After a vowel, often the form -ca
occurs while -aca tends to be used after a consonant. However, there are exceptions
since -ca also appears after a consonant although it does so less often. There is no
natural class of consonants558 that requires the form -ca.","[263, 264, 265]"

6 ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS, AND NEGATIONIn this chapter I will describe the adverbial subclasses as well as the postpositions of
Uchumataqu The final section will be concerned with the negation particle ana6 1 Adverbs
Adverbs occur as modifiers of verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, ι e they are
""modifiers of constituents other than nouns"" (Schachter 1985 20) In most languages,
adverbs do not form a closed class, but rather show the same features as nouns,
adjectives, or verbs The following approach to adverbs roughly follows Schachter
(1985 20ff), ι e adverbs can be divided into three subclasses
1) verbal modifiers of time, location and direction, manner,
2) modifiers of other adverbs and adjectives expressing degree,
3) adverbs that express the speaker's attitude towards his / her predication
In what follows, the adverbial system of Uchumataqu will be discussed Adverbs in
Uchumataqu can be viewed as standing between nouns and adjectives as roughly
summarised by the following figure Thus, they do not form a closed class in
Uchumataqu
                                  Adverbs

                   Figure 6 1 Adverbs in Uchumataqu
This is only a very general rule since exceptions occur on both sides, ι e on the
nominally as well as on the adjectivally encoded side However, the following
subclasses of adverbs can be established in Uchumataqu, which will be discussed one
by one
1 ) temporal adverbs
2) spatial adverbs
3) adverbs of manner
4) adverbs expressing degree with verbs
5) adverbs expressing degree with other adverbs or adjectives
No lexical means that signal the speaker's attitude could be established This is
possibly due to the fact that such notions are expressed by verbal suffixes, such as
urealis -oca (cf 5 8 2) or certainty -kala (cf 5 9) However, affirmative -pini seems
to express, at least in part, the speaker's attitude and will therefore be discussed at the
end of this section
252                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
The lists of adverbs given in what follows are by no means exhaustive but rather
include only those items that can be verified for at least two different sources, i.e.
only the better documented and most reliable forms are listed.","[266, 267, 268, 269]"
"7.1 Clausal and personal clitics
""A clitic is a bound morpheme that functions at a phrasal or clausal level, but which
binds phonologically to some other word, known as the host."" (Payne 1997:22,
markings by the author). Clitics are not bound to a specific clause types, but are
nonetheless crucial for the analysis and interpretation of Uchumataqu clause types.
Therefore, these clitic elements will be introduced before I discuss Uchumataqu
clause types.
      Uchumataqu has two sets of clitic elements: the first set consists of the clausal
clitics affirmative -pini, declarative -cay, and topic marker -ki, while the second set
comprises the personal clitics -/, -m, and -5 (first, second, and third person). Before I
describe these elements, I will discuss the ground on which they can be termed
clitics. I follow Zwicky and Pullum (1983:503ff) for this discussion. According to the
authors, six criteria establish the clitic nature of an element. These criteria will be
examined for their truth value of the Uchumataqu clitic elements.
      The first criterion for clitichood is that clitics show ""a low degree of selection
with respect to their host."" (Zwicky and Pullum 1983:503). This requirement is met
by clausal clitics since they can occur on every part of speech without any restriction.
(1)        ninaka lik-cay
           they     drink-DEC
           'They drink.'                                         (Métraux 1935:92)
(2)        hasi-ki     kuifaj-kifnaj ok-a-cay wir-ki
           now-TOP house-DlR         go-FU-DEC I-TOP
           'Now, I will go to the house.'            (Vellard 1967:20)
The same is true for personal clitics. Please consider examples (3) and (4).
(3)        heki aka winsi-s   pit-[a]c[a]-aki
           who tomorrow-CL=3 come-lR-FU
           'Who will come tomorrow?'                             (Vellard 1967:15)
(4)        tomxe-ki       ana-l          t(a)xa-cay wir-ki
           today-TOP NEG-CL=1            sleep-DEC      I-TOP
           'Today, I did not sleep.'601                          (Uhle 1894:12b)
The second criterion is that there ""are no arbitrary gaps in the set of host-clitic
combinations - no cases where a PARTICULAR host word fails to combine with [...]
 "" Temporal relationship expressed in the example is based on Uhle.
268                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
clitics."" (Zwicky and Pullum 1983:504, marking by the authors). This is a logical
consequence of the first criterion, since the clausal as well as the personal clitics
appear on every morpheme combination, either nominal, verbal, or attributive (cf.
examples 1 to 4). That is, there is no rule which forbids the combination of either of
these elements with e.g. a verb inflected with past tense 1 -u.
      The third criterion concerns phonology: ""[...] no cases where a particular host-
clitic combination shows an unexpected phonological form. Hosts are unaffected by
these clitics, and the clitics themselves have allomorphs distributed by general rules
referring to phonological and morphological properties of the host."" (Zwicky and
Pullum 1983:505). The application of one (or more) of the clausal clitics does not
change phonological or morphological properties the host602 (5), and only in some
rare cases is the final stem vowel deleted.
(5)        ana xuwa sels-cay ana-pini sleki sini
           NEG totora  be-DEC NEG-AFF duck egg
           'There are no totora reeds [there are] never [again] duck eggs.'
                                                         (Vellard 1949:151)
Personal clitics -/, -m, -s never cause the deletion of a stem or final vowel. If either of
them is to occur between two consonants, a linking vowel is inserted, resulting in
either -/-/' / -/-/, -m-i /-i-m, or -s-i I -is.
(6)        lisla-l-i       pek-u-cay
           leg-CL=l-LV want-lSG-DEC
           'I love legs (of women).'                     (Métraux 1935:90)
(7)        am-i-m       pi[c]-cay
           you-LV-CL=2 come-DEC
           'You (sg) come.'
           {'aminpica')                                  (Métraux 1935:109)
A further syntactic criterion of Zwicky and Pullum (1983:505f) is that ""[s]yntactic
rules can affect affixed words, but cannot affect clitic groups. [...], no syntactic
operations exist which treat a word combined with one of the clitics [...] as a unit.""
This criterion cannot be applied to the clausal clitics. Affirmative -pini, declarative
-cay, and topic marker -ki have fixed positions following all other nominal or verbal
markers and cannot change positions among each other or with any of their preceding
suffixes. That is, they are bound to an enclitic position. In contrast, the personal
clitics -/, -m, -s have the freedom to occur in a pro- as well as enclitic position (8) and
thus, never form a fixed unit with their host the way an affix does. Furthermore, there
are examples that suggest that -/, -m, -s are able to split up compounds (9).

          'We go hunting fish in the new balsa raft.' (Vellard 1949:155)
Two last criteria listed by Zwicky and Pullum (1983:504, 505) are: ""[...] no cases
where the contribution of these clitics to sentence meaning is not identical to the
conribution of their associated full forms."", and further: ""Clitics can attach to material
already containing clitics, but affixes cannot."". With respect to first criterion, the
personal clitic of second person -m is reminiscent of the personal pronoun am 'you'
and could be derived from the personal pronoun. However, apart from this, the clitic
elements of Uchumataqu do not develop from contractions of otherwise full forms
and thus, this criterion cannot be applied to Uchumataqu. With respect to the second
requirement, we find that declarative -cay and topic marker -ki are mutually exclusive
but it is well possible for declarative -cay to follow affirmative -pini (10). No
instance is found where -pini is followed by topic marker -ki. Affirmative -pini can
be also combined with personal clitics (11), although this is rather exceptional.
Among each other, the personal clitics are mutually exclusive due to the person
reference they express. No other nominal, adjectival, or verbal morpheme can follow
after a member of the sets of clitics has been attached. With that, the final criterion of
Zwicky and Pullum is fulfilled.(10)      ana-pini-cay hoxk-aca-cay
          NEG-AFF-DEC gO-IR-DEC
           'Certainly not; we cannot go.'
           ('hoxk '-hacacay')                                    (Vellard 1949:151 )

           '(S)he scolded much with me.'                         (Vellard 1951:36)
In sum, of the six criteria named by Zwicky and Pullum for the establishment of
clitics, four are fulfilled by all of the forms discussed here, while a fifth (the syntactic
criterion) is fulfilled only by the personal clitics. A final criterion cannot be examined
due to language specific features, i.e. the lack of adjacent full forms. However, I
regard the results of the preceding discussion satisfying enough to label -pini, -cay,
and -ki as well as -/, -m, and -5 clitic elements605.","[284, 285, 286]"
" 7.8.1 Coordinate clauses
Only two types of coordinate clauses can be established with some certainty:
juxtaposed and exclusive clauses. No means to express conjunction (e.g. 'and') or
disjunction (e.g. 'or', 'but') are found.
      Juxtaposed clauses consist of two (or more) main clauses following each other
without any further conjunction. In most cases, both coordinate clauses are marked
with declarative -cay.
(75)      taxa-cay mica650 tesa-cay
          sleep-DEC wick        extinguish-DEC
          'We sleep. We extinguish the wick.'
          (' Wir wollen uns wieder legen, lösche das Licht aus. ' We want to lie down,
          extinguish the wick.)                                  (Uhle 1894:98.1)
If one of the coordinate clauses does not have declarative -cay (76), this probably
indicates a higher degree of clausal integration.
(76)      aciwa      cu:l-cay          curka untu hipu
          sail    fillout-DEC          great strong wind
          'The sail fills out, [it is a] great, strong wind.'    (Vellard 1949:162)
One of the coordinate clauses can be a predicate clause of any type (cf. 76 and 77).
No specific device is used to juxtapose a simple declarative and a predicate clause.
(77)      cunfij-kas-kaci-cay k^asi wir-i-l-i lik-a-cay
          good-PRE-PRE-DEC water I-LV-CL=1-LV drink-FU-DEC
          'The water is good, I will drink.'            (Vellard 1967:11)
Often one of the coordinate clauses consists of the verbal predicate alone while the
other shows the unmarked word order of declarative clauses, i.e. SV or OV (cf. 75
and 78). Juxtaposed predicate clauses either precede or follow the coordinate clause.
(78)      Icepit-fajca-cay ni-stani     kepit-cay
          retum-lR-DEC that-COM retum-DEC
          'We have to return, with that we return.'              (Vellard 1949:160)
By exclusive clauses I understand two coordinate clause one of which is negated with
ana (cf. Villafane 2004:152; cf. 6.3).
(79)      kuni wata-cay ni-ki            ana paxk-cay kesa-ki
          dry    year-DEC that-TOP NEG grow-DEC potato-TOP
          'The year is dry; thus, the potatoes do not grow.'  (Vellard 1949:151)  From Spanish mecha 'wick' Person reference is based on Uhle.
286                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAThe negated (= exclusive) as well as the non-exclusive clause both reveal the basic
word order of declarative clauses, i.e. in the exclusive clause, negation ana is
followed by either SV or OV. It can also consists of either a non-verbal predicate or
the verbal predicate alone, as in (80).
(80)           cigni thun-aki-cay ana pica-y-cay651
               rain arrive-FU-DEC NEG come-?-DEC
               'When the rain comes (= If it rains), I will not come.' (Muysken 2005:69)
However, the non-exclusive clause has a tendency to appear as a predicate clause
(79) or is more elaborate by including indirect complements (81 ), a feature not found
in exclusive clauses.
(81)           am-tani        ok-[s]i     pek-u-cay            ana-l    wir-ki
               you-COM        gO-AN       want-lSG-DEC         NEG-CL=1 I-TOP

              ('amtani olfipekuca anal wirkipuiriufcai)')                         (Métraux 1935:110)
In most cases, both exclusive and non-exclusive clauses carry declarative -cay.
Negative ana occurs just with one clause, it appears only exceptionally in both
clauses.
(82)           ana xuwa sels-cay ana-pini sleki sini
               NEG totora  be-DEC NEG-AFF duck egg
               'There is no totora, [there are] never [again] duck eggs.'

There is only weak evidence for a possible conjunction nektaru 'because of, that is
why', and (83) is the only readily interprétable clause displaying this item. It is
possible that nektaru (provided it has been a regular conjunction) is related to the
Connective nikstani 'then, afterwards' but what this relationship might have been or
whether nikstani itself served as a conjunction, remains uncertain. Please note that
the preposed clause shows right-dislocation whereas the conjoined clause reveals an
unmarked word order.

7.8.2 Complement clauses
The term complement is understood here as an argument required by the semantics of
the matrix verb. The following discussion654 will be restricted to non-finite
complement clauses since finite complement clauses in Uchumataqu have the shape
of juxtaposed matrix clauses and are thus treated under the heading of coordination
(e.g. example 81).The data suggest that Uchumataqu allows for object complements
only.
       Non-finite complement clauses are built with either chain verb constructions or
action nominaliser -s(i) (cf. 5.6 and 5.7). What is called chain verb constructions here
differs from typical serial verb constructions since the chained verbs of Uchumataqu
do not denote aspects of one action or event but refer to different actions or events.
However, one action or event is usually dependent on the other. Furthermore, I would
like to point out that the data on complement clauses is limited and show little
variation with respect to the matrix verb (they are almost exclusively limited to
volition verbs). It is particularly with action nominaliser -s(i) that we lack entire
clauses in the data. This marker occurs mainly with singular items where an infinitive
is required.
       Chain verb constructions are indicated by zero marking of the complement verb,
i.e. it carries neither person, tense or aspect markers nor declarative -cay.
(84)      ana liks     pek-u-cay
          NEG drink want-lSG-DEC
          ' I do not want to drink. '                        (Muysken 2005:46)
The same is true for complements built with the action nominaliser: the complement
is marked by -s(i) but it does not cany any other tense, aspect, or mood marking.
(85)      kasari-s "" pek-u-cay
          marry-AN want-lSG-DEC
          'I want to marry.'                                (Uhle 1894:94.2)
Although the following example at first sight appears to be a typical instance of a
-sf/j-marked complement clause, the sentence is striking. The matrix verb is ok- 'to
go' and thus, it is remarkable that it selects the use of a complement at all.
Furthermore, the translation as provided by Métraux suggests a purposive
interpretation, which does not match the use of action nominaliser -s(i) as attested
elsewhere, and besides that one would expect either purpose marking -xapa or a
construction involving subject relativiser -ni with a motion verb in matrix position if
indeed a purpose meaning was intended. I present the clause but so far I am unable to
provide an explanation, except for the proposition that it represents a
misinterpretation.","[302, 303, 304]"

   The form -ca occurs after Ini, Ikl, It/, and /j/
559
   Uhle (1894) also reports a form -kal which is attached to personal pronouns only and no example is
found where -kal is used in a clause exphcitely marked as being from Uchumataqu Furthermore, Uhle
himself admits to be uncertain about the nature of this form (1894:39) For these reasons, I do not include
the form -kal in the analysis presented here

                                                            (Métraux 1935:109)

Certainty -kala appears with past and present tense but not with future tense562. This
restriction is based on pragmatics, because one cannot be certain about an event that
will take place in the future. However, certainty -kala can be preceded by resultative
-t (cf. 5.2.1) as in examples (129) and (131) or else is attached to the verb stem (130).
Irrealis -aca (1,3) and declarative -cay (2, 3) optionally follow.

                                                              (Vellard 1949:166)
In most cases, a subject or subject pronoun is attached to express person reference
(cf. 129, 131), although there are a few instances in which person reference is not
marked at all, as in (130). It is noteworthy that certainty -kala has a tendency to
appear with third person singular or plural but whether it is limited to these cannot be
answered564. It remains uncertain, whether Uchumataqu possess a similar marker for
first and / or second person. As with other verbal markers, clitic elements alone do
not contribute to person reference.
      According to Métraux (1935), certainty -kala also appears on the adverb tuku- or
nukukal 'enough'. Other sources only demonstrate the use of predicator -kasi on
adverbs (cf. 4.3.2; 6.1.6). However, in the case ofn/tukukal we may assume that the
use of -kala is lexicalised.
(132)          nukukal pek-u-cay
               enough want-lSG-DEC
               'I want enough.'                                       (Métraux 1935:91)
In example (133), certainty -kala is attached to the non-verbal negation ana 'no'
taking a position normally reserved for affirmative -pini565. The confusion of these
elements points out that for the speaker -kala and -pini are conceptually close and
this strengthens the interpretation of Uchumataqu -kala as certainty. It is noteworthy
that certainty -kala and affirmative -pini never occur in the same clause566.","[265, 266]"
"3.6.3 Verbs
Verbs express actions, events, and processes and their prototypical function is to act
as predicates (Schachter 1985:9). However, in Uchumataqu verbs can function as
arguments as well, i.e. they take up a function usually reserved for nouns. It is
possible to distinguish two different kinds of verbal arguments. The first group
consists of nominalised verbs, or as Schachter (1985:9, italics by the author) puts it,
""verbal nounsfs]"", i.e. forms that are derived from verbs but which cannot function as
verbs any more. In Uchumataqu, verbal nouns are built by nominalisation with
subject relativiser -ni or action nominaliser -s(i) (105 and 106).

(106)        ikan-si kumi pek
             rest-AN you want
             'Do you (sg) want to rest?'                               (Vellard 1949:169)
Neither ta[n]-ni nor ikan-si could serve as a predicate of the given clause but instead
are arguments of ok- 'to go' ana pek- 'to want', respectively.
     The second group of verbal arguments consists of zero marked forms. Please
compare example (107) to example (108).
(107)        kunua pek-u-cay
             woman want-1 SG-DEC
             'I want a woman (= wife).'                                 (Vellard 1967:14)
(108)        sisa pek-u-cay
             know want-1 SG-DEC
             'I want to know.'                                          (Vellard 1967:19)
In example (108), no distinctive marking is found on the verb sisa- 'to know' and
morphosyntactically it behaves like a noun. Furthermore, nouns themselves can be
the predicate of a clause and these nominal predicates are not marked distinctively,
either328, since Uchumataqu does not employ a copula to mark nouns used as
predicates (cf. example 109 and 3.6.1).
(109)        wakii29 son[i]-cay tiksi
             many      man-DEC here
             'There are a lot of people here.'                          (Métraux 1935:99)
That puts Uchumataqu into a situation as described by Schachter (1985:12): ""[...] a
functional distinction between nouns and verbs becomes difficult to establish to the
extent that nouns occur as predicates and verbs as arguments without any distinctive
marking."". To a certain degree we find this overlap between the two categories in
Uchumataqu.
      Notions typically associated with Uchumataqu verbs are tense, aspect, and mood
(cf. Schachter 1985:10), while the verbal notions voice and polarity are not marked in
Uchumataqu. Nouns do not express any of these concepts

158                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Thus, from a structural point of view nouns and verbs can be clearly distinguished in
Uchumataqu. The categories of tense, aspect, and mood are confined to verbs,
whereas notions such as e.g. number are expressed by nouns only.
     Like most if not all languages Uchumataqu has intransitive and transitive verbs,
although the argument of a transitive verb is not necesarily expressed overtly. This is
particularly the case when object marker 2 -n is applied and we may assume that the
argument of these instances is either already known from context (example Ilia, b,
and c), or else easily inferable (for further discussion, cf. 5.4.3).
( I l l ) a.      awaritism    hun-n-ay
                  spirits      give-OB2-IMP
                  'Give me [some] spirits!'
            b.    hun-n-a-cay
                  give-OB2-FU-DEC
                  'I will give it.'
            c.    lik-a-cay        hap 'pay
                  drink-FU-DEC father
                  'I will drink [it], oh father!'                (Vellard 1949:168)
Although one would expect to find object marker 2 -n in (111c), it is missing from
(111c). This may be due to the fact that the argument of likacay 'I will drink' has
already been established in the previous conversation and its marking by -n or overt
expression is considered unnecessary.
      Uchumataqu does not show a structural distiction between verb classes. The
different kinds of verb class that can be distinguished semantically are motion verbs,
action verbs, action-process verbs, factive, cognition, and utterance verbs (cf. Payne
1997:54ff). Below, the most common types of verb class are listed with examples:
         MOTION VERBS                      ACTION VERBS

The verb classes are structurally not distinctive, i.e. every member of every verb class
can be inflected with e.g. future tense -aki. However, the verb classes select different
nominal case markers (for further discussion, cf. chapter 4).
      In sum, on the basis of their functional properties verbs are not always easily
distinguished from nouns and with respect to function we find a considerable overlap
between these categories. As has been shown for nouns and adjectives there are no
clear-cut boundaries between the several parts of speech in Uchumataqu. However, in
terms of their structural properties verbs can be set apart from other word classes by
their ability to be marked for tense, apect, and mood. These concepts are encoded
verbally and are not found on any other grammatical category in Uchumataqu.
The following table summarises what has been said about the three main grammatical
categories in Uchumataqu. Shaded areas denote overlaps between categories. Please
note that adjectival subcategories are not considered.","[173, 174, 175, 176]"

Table 4.16: Morphosyntactic and semantic features of adjectives4.3.1 Attributive function
Attributive adjectives qualify a noun in some way. It seems that the only possible
word order for attributive adjectives is that they precede the subject (123), (124). If
this is true, the only exceptions from the regular word order appear with predicative
adjectives but not with adjectives in attributive function.

In most cases attributive adjectives do not take any other morphemes (123), (124) (cf.
Croft 2003:185) but it is only the adjectival stem that precedes the subject. The only
grammatical morphemes attached to adjectives in attributive function are the clausal
clitics declarative -cay (125) and Topic marker -fa' (125), although this occurs rarely.

  istansia is a loan from Spanish eslancia 'estate'
200                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
As with predicative adjectives, the decision to inflect attributive adjectives with
either the declarative or the Topic marker is one of focus and topic and is therefore
subject to the speaker's intention.
     If there are modifiers or the negation particle ana, they precede both adjective
and subject.
(127)         [...] ana ci cuni qhasi
                     no that good water
              '[...]; that is not good water.'             (Vellard 1967:11)
(128)         ci cauk para

              'that big stick'                             (Métraux 1935:100)4.3.2 Predicative function
Predicative adjectives are found in the form of either adjectival predicate clauses or
as adjectives in predicative function. The former is understood as a clause in which
the adjective itself is the predication whereas the latter describes a clause in which it
makes a predication about a noun.
     Adjectival predicate clauses most often have the form of adjective plus
declarative -cay followed by the demonstrative pronoun //' 'this' plus Topic marker
(129)         kuma-cay ti-ki
              clean-DEC this-TOP
              'This is clean.'
              Ckuma ca-tiki')                              (Vellard 1951:11)
Adjectives in predicative function most commonly follow the subject although there
are some counterexamples. Declarative -cay is attached to the adjective in most
cases.
(130)         si:         k 'utini-cay
              sun(light) warm-DEC
              'The sun(light) is warm.'                    (Vellard 1950:65)
In both forms the adjective can take predicator -kasi 'to be' which itself can be
followed by declarative -cay. The use of -kasi is limited to the predicative use of
adjectives (10) although they can also occur without -kasi (cf. 4.3).
(131)         cuni-kasi-cay?
              gOOd-PRE-DEC
              'Are you well?' (lit: 'Be good?')            (Uhle 1894:66.1)

              this man-TOP ? (-DEC) ready-PRE
              'This man is ready.'                         (Métraux 1935:105)
  listo is a loan from Spanish
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOMINAL SYSTEM                                                                         201
If there are adverbs or the negation ana they precede the adjective in an adjectival
predicate clause. In these cases, adverbs are not marked morphologically.
(133)          inawis       uca-cay      ti-ki
               rather/quite small-DEC this-TOP
               'This is rather / quite small.'
               ('inawis ucacatikV)                                    (Métraux 1935:103)
(134)          ana ci       cuni...
               NEG that good...
               'That is not good ...'                                 (Vellard 1967:2)
When adjectives in predicative function are modified by adverbs, we find three
different possibilities for word order. There is a strong tendency to place the subject
before the adjective:
                -     SUB     ADJ      ADV
                -     SUB     ADV      ADJ
                -     ADV     SUB      ADJ
The position of the sentence's constituents probably depends on focus (marked with
-cay) and the speaker's intention, as the following examples demonstrate:
(135)          wata-kfij       aski-cay   iyai
               village-TOP far-DEC        more
               'The village is further away.'                         (Métraux 1935:100)
(136)          wata      iya-cay      aski-n
               village more-DEC far-?
               'The village is further away.'                         (Métraux 1935:104)
In sum, the most common word order in adjectival predicate clauses is: adjective
inflected with declarative -cay followed by a demonstrative pronoun inflected with
topic marker -ki. When there are adverbs, they precede the entire construction.
      For adjectives in predicative function one can state that the subject mostly
precedes the adjective while adverbs are free in their position according to focus and
the speaker's intention435.","[216, 217, 218]"
"7.7.4 Possessive predicate clauses
The next type to be discussed are possessive predicate clauses. Benefactive -taki (on
the possessor) and possessive -ci (on the possessed) occur with this type of
predication. Here, the predicate is often inflected with declarative -cay.
(65)       ti-ki        ucumi-takfij-cay
           this-TOP we-BEN-DEC
           'This is ours.'                                       (Uhle 1894:65)
(66)       ana cer(a)-ci-cay ti soni-ki
           NEG hair-POS-DEC this man-TOP
           'This man has no hair.'                               (Métraux 1935:104)
In some cases, the copulative verb sel- 'to be, exist' occurs as well. However, it is no
crucial element of the predication, since in those cases, the predication is expressed
by benefactive -taki (67).
(67)       wir-takfij sel-cay koya
           I-BEN       be-DEC house
           'I have a house, (lit.: 'For me a house exists.').' (Vellard 1951:33)
The subject of possessive predicate clauses mainly takes topic marker -ki (65 and 66)
or else is zero marked (67). In Muysken (2005), possession is expressed by
juxtaposition only, i.e. neither possessive -ci nor benefactive -taki are in use any
more. There is a slight tendency for the subject to precede the predicate (65 and 68)
but there are exceptions (e.g. 66). It is also possible for a possessive predicate clause
to consist of the predicate alone (69), although this is not frequent.646

The last predication type to be discussed are attributive predicate clauses, i.e. clauses
that predicate either a quality or a quantity. Morphological features of this type are
predicator -kasi as well as the clausal clitics affirmative -pini and declarative -cay (cf.
7.2.1 and 7.2.3). Both predicator -kasi and affirmative -pini can be followed by
declarative -cay.

As shown in (72), it is also possible for the predicate, here uca 'small', to be zero
marked.

            'This pocket knife is small.'                             (Vellard 1967:21)
As with other predication types, the subject of an attributive predicate clause is either
marked by topic marker -ki (70 and 72) or zero marked (73).
(73)        wara wara yuk-cay
            star star many-DEC

Again, there is a slight tendency for the subject to precede the predicate but often the
predicate appears on its own.

7.8 Complex sentences
Various types of complex sentences exist in Uchumataqu, of which I will give a
presentation in the following.","[300, 301, 302]"
"3.5.2 Adjectival and adverbial reduplication
In most cases, adjectives reduplicate only their initial syllable and reduplication of
the entire stem (or root) is exceptional.
(54)      cu-cuni
          RED-good
          'very good'                                   (Vellard 1951:10)
(55)      ana    cu-cuni
          NEG RED-good
          'disgusting'                                  (Polo 1901:470)
Example (56) shows the reduplication of the entire (admittedly monosyllabic)
adjectival stem.
(56)      ca-ca-cay
          old-old-DEC
          'very old man'                                (Vellard 1950:60)
The function of adjectival reduplication is always augmentative regardless of whether
there is partial or, less common complete reduplication.
     There is only one instance of adverbial reduplication present in the sources. It is
lexicalised; no basic, non-reduplicated form can be found. Example (57)
demonstrates this instance, with the entire stem reduplicated.
(57)      loaloa
          'quickly'                                     (Métraux 1935:110)3.5.3 Nominal and pronominal reduplication
Nouns and pronouns show the broadest range of reduplication types and functions.
Particularly nouns can reduplicate their initial or final syllable or the enire stem, and
functions most commonly expressed are either augmentative or plurality. The latter
can be expressed only in case the entire nominal stem is reduplicated. This may be
due to the fact that partial reduplication is insufficient in conveying the idea of
plurality and instead, the entire stem must be reduplicated. There are no such
constraints with an augmentative function, which can occur with partial and complete
nominal reduplication. The following examples show the types of reduplication and
functions found with nouns and pronouns.
     Examples (58) and (59) demonstrate the reduplication of initial and final
syllables. For none of the items basic, non-reduplicated forms can be established and
thus, the impact of reduplication cannot be established.

(58)          tututin
              'skin rash'                                          (Métraux 1935:96)
(59)          tululu
              'uncle'                                              (Vellard 1950:61)
The following is the only instance where an initial consonant cluster is reduplicated.
As in the preceding two examples, the function of reduplication is unknown and the
term is possibly lexicalised.
(60)           cckispi
              '[egg]shell, skin [of fruits, etc.]'                  (Lehmann 1929b:3)
Example (61) presents an instance where the initial syllable is reduplicated with an
augmentative function. The same meaning is expressed in example (62) with the
entire stem reduplicated.
(61)          cu-cula
              RED-child
              'child, little boy'                                   (Vellard 1950:60)
(62)          tur-tur
              girl-girl
              'little girl (less than three years)'                 (Vellard 1950:60)
Example (63) shows the augmentative function of pronominal reduplication.
(63)          ni-ni-ksi
              that-that-LOC
              '(over) there, yonder'                               (Métraux 1935:99)
It is only with pronouns that a possible distributive function may be expressed, as in
(64) and (65). There are only a few instances.
(64)          cila      cila
              another another
              'each of us'                                          (Vellard 1949:163)
                                       211
(65)          ci-u[n] ci-ufnj-cay

As mentioned above, plurality is conveyed only in case the entire stem is
reduplicated as shown in the following example.
(66)          s(i)ki-siki
              garment-garment
              'clothes'
              ['lapeau']                                            (Métraux 1935:96)
311
      ci-un is a combination of the Uchumataqu numeral ci and Spanish uno, both meaning 'one'

Names of astronomical constellations can be regarded as lexicalised In cases such as
these, reduplication has the function of expressing plurality
(67)          warawara
              'stars'                                            (Metraux 1935 96)

              'it is the Pleiades'                                       (Vellard 1950 67)
A similar situation is found with animal names, which are often built by reduplication
of either the initial syllable or the entire stem As with astronomical phenomena, we
may consider them lexicalised
(69)          kusi-kusi-cay
              'it is a spider'                                           (Vellard 1950 87)
                             m
(70)          ma-ma m
              RED-falcon
              'falcon'                                                   (Lehmann 1929b 7)
In some cases, reduplication serves an onomatopoetic effect
(71)          ko ko ro ko™
              'rooster'                                                  (Lehmann 1929d 8)
(72)          tsiru-tsi ru
              'mosquito'                                                 (Lehmann 1929d 10)
Another special case is the reduplication of grammatical material It affects nouns,
adjectives, and numerals and occurs only with possessive marking -ci It is unlikely
that reduplication of possessive -ci is lexicalised since every word bearing
reduplicated -ci has a basic, non-reduplicated form Furthermore, reduplication of -ci
is exceptional since in the majority of all cases, the marker is not reduplicated Thus,
the function of this reduplication type is not entirely clear but it is possible that it
denotes a very close and possibly inalienable kind of possession If this assumption is
true, reduplication of -ci could be considered to be augmentative in function
Consider the following examples
(73)          kurs-ci-ci
              tail-POS-POS
              'rabbit (ht tail-having)'                                   (Lehmann 1929d 5)
(74)          ana kar-ci-ci
              NEG hand-POS-POS
              'one-armed, one-handed (lit 'not arm-/hand-having')'(Polo 1901 472)312
      A word shared with Aymara (cf Van der Voort 2004)
3,3
      Examples (69) and (70) are items also used in Aymara
314
      This onomatopoetic expression is probably a borrowingfromSpanish
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                  149
Reduplication of possessive -ci is not restricted to body parts but can also occur with
adjectives describing characteristics and numerals
(75)     tuk[i]-ci-ci
          old-pos-pos
          'grandfather (ht old / age-having)'                    (Polo 1901 464)
(76)     kalu cep-ci-ci
         ten     three-POS-POS
         'thirteen'                                    (Vellard 1951 18)
The interpretation of reduplicated -ci as marking a very close relation is further
supported by its use on numerals (cf 4 4) Vellard (1951 17ff) reports the
reduplication to appear on every numeral higher than ten (cf example 76)
In conclusion, I would like to state that reduplication must have been a fairly
productive means of stem modification once, but lexicalisation has often obscured its
meaning This is particularly the case with verbs However, with adjectives, nouns,
and pronouns some regularities can be detected Adjectives mainly reduplicate their
initial syllable and due to their semantics convey only an augmentative meaning,
whereas nouns and pronouns show partial or complete reduplication In contrast to
adjectives, nominal reduplication can have the function of plurality but only with
complete reduplication3 6 Parts of speech
According to Payne (1997 32, bold marking by the author), ""grammatical
categories are called 'parts of speech'"" or are sometimes also referred to as ""lexical
categones"" The lexical content of an Uchumataqu word is sometimes hard to grasp
due to diverging or even missing translations Therefore, I will classify Uchumataqu
categones primarily on the basis of their structural and functional properties, ι e
according to their morphosynatctic behaviour Pursuing this approach the following
parts of speech can be established nouns, adjectives, and verbs Two somewhat
special cases are particles and so-called phrases, ι e fixed expressions found in
everyday life's communication Particles do not form a word class of their own but
do not belong to another word class either Phrases, even less than particles, do not
form a grammatical category but will be treated here as a final remark on
Uchumataqu parts of speech They differ syntactically from prototypical noun or verb
phrases and clause types and thus will not be considered in chapter 7
      Although it is well possible to establish three grammatical categories the
boundanes between them are not always clear-cut (cf Schachter 1985 6, Payne
1997 32) These overlaps are observed for other languages too and go as far as to
bring into question the traditional distinction between the different categories (cf
Croft 2003 183)
      In what follows, I will use the terms 'grammatical category' and 'parts of
speech' alike to refer to the Uchumataqu categones Further, I would like to point out
that for the subsequent outline of the classification of Uchumataqu parts of speech, I
roughly follow Schachter (1985) and Payne (1997)
150                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
3.6.1 Nouns
Notions most typically associated with nouns are time-stability (Payne 1997:33) and
referentiality (Croft 2003:185) to ""persons, places, and things"" (Schachter 1985:7),
the latter concepts considered to be prototypically encoded by nouns.
Payne (1997:33)3'5 lists as functional properties of nouns their ability to act as the
head of noun phrases, to serve as either subject or object of a clause, and to be most
commonly the topic of texts. The head of a noun phrase can be characterised as ""the
one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity that the whole phrase refers
to"" (Payne 1997:33) (cf. 77).
(77)       co:k lu.si
           big    jar
           'abigjar'                                              (Métraux 1935:94)
Example (77) is about ajar, not about co.k 'big', which only specifies the type of jar.
That is, the phrase itself refers to lu.si 'jar', but not to co.k and therefore, lu.si is the
head of the phrase.
     Another function of nouns is as predicates and as such, no particular marking or
copulative device is required. Please consider (78).
(78)       paya           koya-cay
           adobebrick house-DEC
           'This is an αί/oèe-house (= a house made from adobe bricks).'
                                                       (Vellard 1967:7)
The role of a predicate is usually reserved for verbs. When nouns are used as
predicates without particular marking, the distinction between nouns and verbs
becomes blurred316.
      Despite this overlap between verbs and nouns, the latter can be set apart by their
ability to function as the subject of a clause (examples 78 and 79).
(79)        hep-[p]im-s          kuyla manti-cay311
            father-AFF-CL=3 house rule-DEC
            'The father rules [in] the house.'                    (Vellard 1951:35)
The noun hep 'father' is the subject of example (79), whereas kuyla 'house' serves as
object. Thus, these findings are in accordance with Payne's definition. However, with
regard to the role of objects we find an overlap with verbs since verbs can likewise
function as arguments, i.e. objects. These cases will be further discussed in 3.6.3.
     The third functional property of nouns mentioned by Payne is their potential to
be the topics of texts, as demonstrated in example (80a) and (80b). As such, they are
often marked by topic marker -ki (bold).","[163, 164, 165, 166, 167]"

30                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Uhle stayed in Irohito between 23rd August and lsl September 1894 (Uhle 1894 m.s.
Chronologie meiner Erfahrungen57:!) and for all we know, this was his only visit to
the community. He does not provide the name of his language consultant but only
refers to him as ""at least one who taught me his language, in spite of his fellows""58
(Uhle 1896:19, translation mine). That is, the Uchumataqu data collected by Uhle
stem from one single speaker and except for the fact that he was male nothing further
is said about him. Neither does Uhle specify the personal relationship to his language
consultant, although he twice mentions him as his ""teacher"" (Uhle 1894:3, 89.1).
However, we do not know whether he refers to his visit to Irohito or Huachacalla.
      With respect to his language skills, Max Uhle spoke Spanish but probably
hardly any Aymara59 at the time he visited Irohito and it was only after his trip to
Irohito that Uhle became more acquainted with Aymara (cf. Rowe 1954:106).
Although he mentions an interpreter for his studies on Chipaya (Uhle 1896:331)60,
we find no unequivocal hint to an interpreter for his trip to Irohito. Only once does
Uhle (1894:82, translation mine) remark upon ""an interpreter speaking a second
Indian language""61 but it remains uncertain whether he refers to his study on Chipaya
or Uchumataqu. However, it seems justified to assume that Uhle was dependent upon
an interpreter in Irohito as well. Thus, the languages used in the process of data
collection must have been Uchumataqu, Aymara, and Spanish.
      The Uchumataqu data have never been published and are thus available only as
a manuscript, which, as part of Uhle's academic legacy, is in the possession of the
Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin. The manuscript is handwritten in what is
today an old-fashioned script called Siitterlin and with a few exceptions Uhle uses
German throughout his notes.
      The part of the manuscript that is of importance here is the grammar of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya called ""Basic outline of an Uro grammar"" (Grundzüge
einer Uro-Grammatik). It consists of 117 single and double pages, some of which are
not numbered, in which case I cite them as e.g. 64.1. Here, 64 refers to the last page
number Uhle used, while . 1 indicates that it is the first unnumbered page after this;
correspondingly, 64.2 would refer to the second unnumbered page following p. 64.
      Although the first section in Uhle's manuscript is about the language of Irohito,
the manuscript itself is concerned with both varieties, i.e. Uhle treats Uchumataqu
and Chipaya and melts them into one grammatical description. He often indicates
where he obtained a particular piece of information from or which variety a statement
refers to, but does not consistently do so. In some cases, he points to differences
between the two varieties. However, Uhle deals with every aspect of the language
and his manuscript is thus an entire grammar of Uru-Chipaya. Although Uhle
collected a considerable number of sentences and more than 600 words in Irohito
 (Uhle 1896:19), his grammar does not contain texts but single sentences. These are
transcribed according to the phonological transcription conventions of Uhle's time

(cf. chapter 2) and therefore the data convey not only grammatical but also
phonological information. As it was common in the late 19th century, Uhle used a
Latin-based model for his grammar, which particularly with respect to the verbal
system led to a certain frustration on the researcher's part:
        While recording the language I tried several times to conjugate a short verbal
        phrase through the different tenses but all I got was that with every person I
        received an entirely new tense changing the entire meaning of the sentence,
        [...]. Particularly the answers on tense were always the most unsatisfactory.
        Some of these answers I had to correct by cross-checking two, three times but
        did not always succeed. (Uhle 1894:84, translation mine)62
Uhle also compares his results to Aymara referring to the grammar of Middendorf
(1891), observing similarities and differences and repeatedly pointing to the
increasing Aymara influence on Uchumataqu.
     From Uhle's difficulties to describe the verbal system a certain bias results
towards the nominal and pronominal system of the language: it is by far the most
elaborate section and an almost complete description of the nominal and pronominal
aspects of Uru-Chipaya. In comparison, the verbal system is less detailed and as
indicated in the quotation above, Uhle is concerned mainly with the tense system,
while he is less interested in e.g. aspectual features. Furthermore, most of the data
exemplifying the verbal system seem to come from Chipaya. Other parts of the
language are treated equally briefly, e.g. postpositions, clausal markers, and adverbs.
Each of these topics receives only a few pages' treatment. In the following I give a
rough sketch of the contents of the grammar. The numbering is mine.

   At the beginning, Uhle uses la, 6a, etc.
64
   These parts are regarded, too, when considered to contribute information to the analysis and
interpretation.

Furthermore, Uhle's manuscript also contains some notes concerning his journey,
and anthropological observations. They are considered for the current work only to a
minor degree.
-     a list of the clauses he collected in Irohito and Huachacalla66 (30 double pages)
      a word list comparing Uchumataqu and Chipaya (six single pages)
-     another word list where Uhle compares his data to those collected by Polo67,
      with a Spanish translation; personal notes by Uhle (24 single pages)
-     a comparative word list labelled 'Uro and Puquina', but which actually contains
      an Uru-German vocabulary (9 pages)
-     a brief word list Spanish-Atacamefio with some notes by Uhle (three pages)
-     a list of words and clauses from Chipaya (24 single pages)
-     some notes and preliminary grammatical interpretations; possibly in preparation
      of the grammar (23 single pages)
 -    detailed notes on his journey, personal experiences, as well as anthropological
      and archaeological observations (all in all 77 pages)
 -    grammatical relations between Quechua and Aymara (one page)
      catechism ('Doctrina Cristiana') in Aymara and Spanish (17 double pages) ""
We find personal notes and comments made by Uhle throughout his manuscript.
Some of them were clearly made while collecting the data, whereas others were
probably added afterwards. They enable us to get an insight into the way Uhle
obtained and treated his information, something he himself does not further specify.
Thus, Uhle reports the expression tsi: wa.sa 'once' but remarks: ""The Indian gave me
tsi u.nu, but u.nu is probably Spanish WHO!""68 (Uhle 1894:33, translation mine). That
is, Uhle does not use the expression his language consultant provided but what he65
   Which is expressed by the copulative verb sel - 'to be' and benefactive -taki
66
   These clauses are repeated from his grammar
67
   Since Polo visited Irohito in 1897, it seems that this list must have been added some time after Uhle
returned from South America
68
   ""der Indiër gab mir tsi u nu an, aber u mi wird = uno span sein1""

considered to be appropriate. It is not unlikely that this happened with other entries,
too, even if Uhle does not mark them as 'corrected'. A similar process can be
observed with the use of parenthesis, as e.g. on -kin(a) 'to, towards' (Uhle 1894:11).
Although Uhle does not explain when and why he uses parenthesis, it is likely that
they mark elements that were not realised due to e.g. elision but which Uhle
considers to be necessary.
     When it comes to an evaluation of the manuscript, we have to take into
consideration that Uhle spent only a short time in Irohito, worked only with one
language consultant, whose background remains unknown, he probably needed an
interpreter speaking Aymara and Spanish, and possibly changed some of his data to
what he considered appropriate. However, despite these restrictions Uhle's work can
be regarded as one of the most important documents on Uchumataqu. Not only was
he the first researcher ever to collect any linguistic data, but he also documented
Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already endangered. His
description of the nominal and pronominal system is supported by following works
and even modem studies on the closely related Chipaya (cf. Cerrón-Palomino 2006)
confirm his findings. In conclusion, Uhle's manuscript contains highly valuable
information on Uchumataqu.","[46, 47, 48, 49, 50]"
"6.1.1 Temporal adverbs
Among the group of adverbs that signal temporal modification we find the following
expressions:
twrnxe™                         'today'
sesko                           'yesterday'
haqa or haqa winsi              'tomorrow'
maxena                          'early day'
wiya56*                         'night'
yasi                            'now'
nikstani569                     'afterwards, then'
wina or wir(i)wina510           'afterwards'
yam tuku                        'not yet'
hiya or his                     'still'.
Some temporal adverbs consist of lexical compounds, such as haqa winsi
'tomorrow'or yam tuku 'not yet' whose constituents can be explained only in part.
The component winsi of haqa winsi 'tomorrow' never occurs on its own and
therefore, nothing can be said about its exact meaning or the semantic impact it has.
The same is true for yam of yam tuku 'not yet'. Sometimes there are alternative
forms, as e.g. hiya or his 'still' but the difference between these forms has also to
remain uncertain.
     Temporal adverbs belong to those adverbs that behave nominally, i.e. they can
be inflected with nominal suffixes (see example 1). However, at least yasi 'now' can
take the adjectival predicator -kasi (cf. example 2 and chapter 4.3.2).

                                511

                                                          (Vellard 1949:162)
                                                                572
The expression yasi 'now' is the only example of a temporal adverb that takes
predicator -kasi. Thus, it has to be regarded as an exception from the general567
      The spelling of this forni differs considerably
' 6 * It is uncertain whether the stem is wiya or wiyam. Inflection points into the direction of wiya.
"" ί , The use of separative -k[i]slam is lexicahsed here. The change of final vowel /a/ to l\I possibly reflects
the use of a dummy element.
570
      win itself means 'anus' but can be used to designate anything which is somewhere at the back.
571
      puka probably derives from aymara phokana 'completar / [ ] cumplir' (DeLucca 1983 352) as does
resultalive -la (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981 117). Vellard ( 1951:13) points to that.
CHAPTER 6 - ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS AND NEGATION                                                           253
morphological coding pattern and the use of predicator -kasi does not appear to be
obligatory, as demonstrated in example (3) (for further discussion, see 6.1.6).
(3)         tusa          caka -cay 3 asi-ki
            balsa_ raft   launch-DEC now-TOP
            'We launch the balsa raft now.'                          (Vellard 1949:155)
As mentioned above, temporal adverbs can take nominal morphemes (except yasi) as
well as clausal clitics, such as topic marker -ki, declarative -cay, affirmative -pini, or
clitic elements. However, in most cases, they are not inflected at all.
(4)         haka      pikiltafnj soni pic[a]-aki-cay
            tomorrow the_two      man come-FU-DEC
            'Tomorrow, two men [together] will come.' (Métraux 1935:109)
The form (-)paca demands some discussion. It occurs twice in the corpus, on
temporal adverbs which are tonx 'today' andjOsz' 'now'.
(5)         tonx paca             as[-]paca
            today INT             now[-]iNT
            'even today'          'now'
            ('aujourd'hui même'1) (lmaintenant,)                     (Métraux 1935:91,100)
These are the only instances where the form (-)paca occurs with temporal adverbs
which provides a small basis for any conclusive statements. However, it seems that
with the expression tonx paca 'even today' a sense of urgency or intensification is
included. Cerrón-Palomino (2006:179, translation mine) observes an identical suffix
for Chipaya which the author labels ""puntualizador"" and describes as follows: ""[...]
the morpheme -paca imprints a sense of urgency or irreplacable pressure on the
situation or event expressed by the phrase to which it is added.""574 I would like to
adopt this definition of-paca and will call the morpheme intensifier (INT). However,
the severly limited database on the form -paca prevents further statements on other
functions or kinds of usage as well as on the type of suffix -paca presents, i.e.
whether it is a nominal, adjectival, or clausal marker. However, it may be well related
to either the Aymara or Quechua word paca which in both languages means 'time'
(DeLucca 1983:328, Lira 1944:720)575.","[269, 270]"

    Closely related Chipaya has been likewise labelled agglutinating (Torero 2002:474, Cerrón-Palomino
2006:77).

    Again with the exception of first person singular, which is marked as wist 'my'

    Uhle does not specify whether this example refers to Uchumataqu or Chipaya.

The second prefix ke- was completely lexicalised on kepic- 'return' when
Uchumataqu was documented. The form ke- is solely found in combination with the
verb pit- 'to come' (cf. 19). The construction kepit- is translated in the sources as 'to
come back, return' and the form ke- thus expresses the notion of 'back to'. For a
more detailed discussion of the prefix ke-, cf. 5.2.2.1.
(18)        kepit-cay

            'you return'                                           (Vellard 1951:26)
However, apart from these two cases all other verbal elements are suffixes expressing
tense, mood, and aspect. The same is true for nominal, adjectival, and adverbial
morphology, which comprises only suffixes.
      Uchumataqu also has clitic elements, which can be split into two groups that are
distinguished by their function282. The first group consists of the markers declarative
-cay, topic marker -ki, and affirmative -pini, which appear in enclitic position (see
examples 17 and 18) and function on the clause level. Declarative -cay and topic
marker -ki are mutually exclusive, but particularly the marker -cay can be preceded
by affirmative -pini. Declarative -cay and topic marker -ki functionally resemble
Aymara -wa and -xa and Quechua -mi and -qa. The second group of clitic elements
bears person reference and consists of-/, referring to first person, -m (second person),
and -s (third person). They appear in pro- or enclitic position, although they
preferably occupy an enclitic position. The personal clitics can follow the first group
of clitic elements, but among themselves are mutually exclusive for the person
reference they express.( 19)       wir-i-l     wat 'ta-kistani pic-a-cay

Although it is possible that the personal clitics had a more comprehensive function
once, their use as reflected in the sources is mainly emphatic. This is particularly the
case with declarative clauses and only in interrogative clauses do they express true
person reference.
     It is noteworthy that the use of prefixes and personal clitics in Uchumataqu does
not occur in other Andean languages, such as Aymara and Quechua.","[150, 151]"

    With one exception found in Métraux (1935 108)
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                        9
The form -paca occurs in two different functions in Uchumataqu. In its first function
it is attached to adverbs of time in order to act as intensifier (cf. 6.1.1). Both Aymara
and Quechua have a noun paca meaning 'time' and it is likely that Uchumataqu -
paca in its intensifying function on temporal adverbs has been inspired by it. There is
another form -paca on Uchumataqu wakpaca 'all, everything', which consists of
Aymara waki 'part, portion' (also 'price') (DeLucca 1983:444) and the totality
marking suffix -pacha (DeLucca 1983:328). The expression wakpaca itself is not
used in Aymara and waki occurs only in the last stage of Uchumataqu, as
documented by Vellard.
      The plural marker -naka occurs in both Aymara and Uchumataqu and it is
impossible to say whether its use on nouns is recent or not, whereas its use on the
personal pronoun ninaka 'they' is possibly a more recent development (cf. 4.1.4).
      Terminative marker -kama occurs in Aymara, Quechua, and Uchumataqu. In
Aymara and Quechua it has a distributive and terminative meaning. In Quechua,
terminative -kama also outlines the direction of a course or trajectory. This meaning
is not found in Aymara but a meaning of terminative -kama limited to Aymara is that
of'only', i.e. exclusiveness. In Uchumataqu, these different meanings of terminative
-kama have been reduced to temporal 'until'. It is this restricted use that gives rise to
the assumption that -kama spread from Aymara or Quechua into Uchumataqu and not
vice versa, although it is not impossible, either, that Aymara or Quechua adopted this
suffix from Uchumataqu and extended its meaning (cf. 4.1.1.6).
       A similar observation can be made for benefactive -taki, which has been
borrowed from Aymara. Uchumataqu adopted only the benefactive function, in
which benefactive -taki is translated as 'for'. In Uchumataqu, possessive predicate
clauses are created with the benefactive marker -taki and the copulative verb sel- 'to
be, exist'. These constructions are translated as 'for X exists', as in wir-takfij sel-cay
koya 'I have a house.' (lit.: 'For me a house exists.' Vellard 1951:33). This function
of benefactive -taki is not found in Aymara (cf. 4.1.2.2).
       The Uchumataqu resultative marker -t resembles the Aymara resultative marker
-ta with respect to form and function to some degree. It is possible that both suffixes
influenced each other or one inspired the use of the other, but Uchumataqu resultative
-/ is not a direct loan from Aymara -ta (cf. 5.2.1).
       The lexicon is by far that part of Uchumataqu that shows the largest degree of
borrowing. However, not every word shared with Aymara or Quechua is necessarily
a loan. We may assume that the name of fish, water birds, types of totora reed and
other water plants as well as denominations for balsa rafts, their parts, and tools for
hunting and fishing were adopted by Aymara and Quechua from Uchumataqu rather
than vice versa. However, when it comes to agricultural terms and words denoting
non-aquatic plants and species, expressions found in both Aymara and Uchumataqu
are probably loans in the latter. Spanish had some influence on Uchumataqu with
respect to kinship terms and, of course, modem technical devices. Note that one of
the last semantic fields not influenced are Uchumataqu numbers10, although Vellard   In contrast to Chipaya, where numerals above 4 have long been replaced by the Aymara terms
10                      UCHUMATAQU THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
(1951 18) reports pataka '100' instead of kalo-kalo, which would have been the
Uchumataqu word The word pataka is Aymara but also close to Quechua pachak
     Finally, I should mention some features that can be described as areal
phenomena rather than loans Among these areal features are the agglutinative nature
of Uchumataqu, its predominately SOV structure, stress on the penultimate syllable,
and the structure of the Uchumataqu nominal and verbal system, which resemble that
of Aymara and Quechua Thus, although Uchumataqu is genetically unrelated to
Aymara and Quechua, centuries-long contact produced a certain degree of adaptation
and similarity
     In the present study, I compare Uchumataqu to the northern Aymara variety
spoken around Lake Titicaca, which has been described by Porterie-Gutiérrez (1981)
and Huayhua Pari (2001), who carried out a study on the Peruvian variety of Aymara
Since Lake Titicaca stretches across the border of Peru and Bolivia, it is justified to
take also into consideration the Peruvian Aymara variety, which may as well have
exerted some influence on Uchumataqu Only if there is an Aymara element present
in my data but undescnbed by Porterie-Gutiérrez and Huayhua Pan do I refer to
works dealing with other Aymara varieties1 2 The present study
In the following I will briefly describe the theoretical framework applied for the
current study, the terminology resulting from the theoretical framework, and the
methodology used m working with the Uchumataqu data7 2 7 Theoretical framework and terminology
Given that the material on Uchumataqu is heterogenous and that the grammatical
description is meant for linguists from different backgrounds, no specific linguistic
theoretical framework is employed Instead, it is first and foremost a descriptive
work, whose theoretical framework can be best described by what Dixon (1997 128)
calls ""Basic Linguistic Theory"" Dryer (in prep 3) supplies the following explanation
of what can be understood by this ""It can thus be roughly described as traditional
grammar, minus its bad features (such as a tendency to describe all languages in
terms of concepts motivated for European languages), plus necessary concepts absent
from traditional grammar [ ] Basic linguistic theory differs from traditional
grammar most strikingly in its attempt to describe each language in its own terms,
rather than trying to force the language into a model based on European languages ""
That is, basic linguistic theory is primarily descriptive, adopting ideas, techniques,
etc from other theories, if they refer to or describe a phenomenon appropriately
      Works that contributed to a considerable degree to the framework of the current
description of Uchumataqu are among others Shopen (1985) and Payne (1997)
Correspondingly, specific terminology has been avoided whenever possible
However, if a particular theoretical concept or term has been borrowed, its usage in
the current grammatical description is explained
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                              11
1.2.2 Notes on methodology and presentation of the data
First, it is necessary to provide a definition of what is considered as primary and
secondary data in the current study. By primary data, I understand data that have
been collected during field-work and thus represent first-hand experience of
Uchumataqu and its speakers. Since the current work is primarily a linguistic
description, purely ethnographic data are considered mainly for background
information on the Uru culture and history (cf. Posnansky 1934, LaBarre 1941,
Palavecino 1949). I consider the following sources as primary data: Uhle (1894),
Polo (1901), Bacarreza (1910), Lehmann (1929), Métraux (1935), LaBarre (1941),
Palavecino (1949), Vellard (1949, 1950, 1951, 1967), Grinevald (1995), and
Muysken (2001, 2005). Secondary data are those that provide an analysis and
interpretation on the basis of primary data and therefore studies as e.g. Torero (2002)
are regarded as secondary data and add to the description only to a minor degree. The
grammatical description attempted is first and foremost concerned with primary
linguistic data on Uchumataqu.
      The spelling of the data quoted here is based on what has been established as the
phonemic system of Uchumataqu (cf. 2.1-2.10). However, it is not a phonemic
spelling in a strict sense, since at the present state of research I am unable to state
what the phonemes of e.g. the word 'to go' are. I will thus present different possible
spellings. This leads, of course, to a certain amount of variation. For example, the
verb for 'to go' is represented as either oq-, ok-, or ok""a (another example can be
found in table 2.1). For further discussion of orthographical practices and
representation, cf. 2.14.
      In most cases I adopt the translations provided by the researchers, who have
been with the Uchumataqu speakers and probably had the best opportunities to cross-
check their material. However, in case I propose an analysis, interpretation, and / or
translation different from that of the researcher, the original analysis, interpretation
and / or translation is provided in brackets. This also applies to Uchumataqu forms,
phrases, or clauses for which I propose a different transcription, as is the case with
e.g. -srap'pa (Vellard 1949-67). I propose to transcribe the form as -s-xapa but add
Vellard's original transcription in brackets. Elements I reconstruct, such as e.g. topic
marker -k[i], are marked by brackets, while parenthesis mark additions, restrictions,
etc. made by the researchers themselves. However, in any case, glosses are mine.
      The primary data are always quoted with the year of publication, i.e. although
Vellard might have collected certain data in 1938, he published them in 1949 and
accordingly, I quote material from this work as Vellard (1949). Only in the case of
the unpublished material of Uhle and Lehmann do I refer to the year the material has
been collected. In Uhle's case, this would be 1894, while Lehmann is quoted as
 1929b and 1929d. Since no other researcher (with the exception of Uhle, see below)
provides data from outside Irohito, this is necessary only with Lehmann.
      As will be further outlined below, Uhle (1894) aims to merge data from
Uchumataqu and Chipaya in his manuscript and in some cases does not indicate
whether a certain example comes from Uchumataqu or Chipaya. Therefore, I decided
to use only those clauses, phrases, etc. that are clearly marked as from Uchumataqu.
However, in some cases I also quote unmarked material, i.e. material the origin of

which is uncertain but I only do so when that material can be confirmed by other
sources on Uchumataqu (e.g. Vellard 1949-67). An example is the phrase am qoya
'your house' (Uhle 1894:46), which is not marked for origin. Since identical phrases
are found in other sources that exclusively contain data from Uchumataqu, such as
amp kui[a]u 'your house' (Vellard 1967:29), Uhle's unmarked example clause can
be included in the grammatical description. However, such cases are exceptional and
if an unmarked example from Uhle's manuscript is given, it is indicated in a footnote.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"

 Our most reliable information on the Uru in pre-colonial times is from sources
written in the Ιό* and 17th century, i.e. from a time when the Spanish were about to
understand and administer their newly conquered colony. Some passages in these
documents (e.g. Gavilân [1621] 1988:85) point to the possibility that, just as the
Aymara, the Uru were once just another ethnic group of Bolivia, which lived all over
the Altipiano, always close to (or even on) the rivers and lakes. This stretch of Uru
population on the Lakes Titicaca, Ροορό, and Coipasa and along the Desaguadero
River was titled ""aquatic axis"" by Nathan Wachtel (1986:283). However, the sources
also suggest that already in pre-Spanish times, the Uru had to suffer from the Inca
system of mitimaes, i.e. the resettlement of ethnic groups in order to stabilise the Inca
empire. In the Relation de los pacajes Mercado de Pefialosa ([1586] 1965:336,
translation mine) points to this: ""[...] and when the Inca came conquering this
province of the Pacaxes, they made these Uru, who were close to the water, leave
[the water] and made them live with the Aymara and taught them to plough and
cultivate the earth and they forced them to pay tribute in fish and make cases of
straw.""19. Thus, even during the Inca reign, the Uru were forced to abandon their
lifestyle (and with it probably their language) and it is possible that the negative
attitude towards the fishing and hunting Uru often found in colonial sources indeed is
from the Inca, which, as farmers and stockbreeders may have had prejudices against
the Uru. Thus, the situation of the Uru today is not a recent development but has its
roots in Inca times.
      However, since reports about the Uru in the pre-Spanish era are not many, I will
tum now to the description of the Uru as given in colonial sources, covering the 16th
and 17th centuries. These early documents can be roughly split into two groups:
chronicles and description of travels on the one hand, and administrative documents
concerned with taxation and number of inhabitants on the other. According to the
different nature of these documents, their reports on the Uru focus either on their
distinct culture and compare them to the Aymara and Quechua population, or they
just give the number of persons classified as Uru and the amount of tax they have to
pay-
      One of the earliest documents to mention them is the Visita a Chucuito
([1567/68] 1964), carried out by Garci Diez de San Miguel (1567/68), which is an
administrative document concerned with taxation. There, the designation Uru refers
to the lowest class of taxation20 but is not primarily the name for an ethnic group. A
similar use of the name Uru is found in the Tosa de Visita General del Toledo
([1573-75] 1975), which is also an administrative document.
      Another important colonial document are the Relaciones Geograficas de Indias.-
Peru (Cook et al. [1586] 1965). On behalf of the viceroy Francisco de Toledo
officials visited virtually every settlement of 'New Spain' and counted taxable21
inhabitants and their belongings, goods, cattle, fields, etc. They also paid a visit to the
"" ""[ ] y cuando los ingas vimeron conquistando esta provincia de los Pacaxes, hicieron salir a estos
indios Uros de junto al agua y les hicieron vivir con los aymaras y les enseflaron a arar y cultivar la tierra y
les mandaron que pagasen de tributo pescado y hiciesen petacas de paja "" For Pacajes, cf below
20
    It is noteworthy that a similar observation was made by Bacarreza (1910 61), almost 400 years later.

department of the Pacajes and gave detailed description of the villages there. One of
these is Machaca, where an Uru population of 270 taxable persons is counted
(Mercado de Pefialosa [1586] 1965:336), living among an Aymara population, which
outnumbered the Uru almost 1 to 10. Mercado de Pefialosa also provides evidence
that this was a situation brought forward by the Inca policy of resettlement (quoted
above). Apart from the remarkable change in economy, the forced vicinity to the
Aymara also caused the Uru to give up their language, which, according to de
Pefialosa, was Puquina, and they turned to Aymara instead (ibid.).
      The Relaciones Geograficas de Indias mention only two more settlements with
Uru populations in the Titicaca region. One of them is Tiwanaku23, where about 100
Uru were counted (ibid.). The other village is Waki and although de Pefialosa does
not give numbers of the Uru population, his note on the Waki Uru is striking. The
official explains that there was only few native livestock, but instead the Uru were
breeding great quantities of pigs. Thus, it seems the Uru people of Waki had quickly
abandoned the traditional economy and successfully adapted a new lifestyle.
      The Spanish officials immediately adopted the Inca policy of resettling ethnic
groups and started their program of the so-called 'reductions' (reducciones). By this,
groups formerly living scattered were forced to move close together into a
(sometimes newly founded) village24. These groups were often of different ethnic
backgrounds and so, Uru who had not been affected by the Inca resettlements, came
now into the focus of the Spanish reducciones and were forced to move into Aymara
villages. This, of course, almost always meant the end to the traditional water-centred
lifestyle of the Uru, an aspect Fray Reginaldo de Lizarraga points to in his
Descripcion breve del Peru ([1608] 1968:67, translation mine): ""The reduction made
them [the Uru KH] eat bread and drink wine, and for the doctrine that was the most
important. But look at them before dawn in their balsa rafts, nearly naked, steering
and fishing [...].""25
      Despite these measures, Uchumataqu must still have had a broader spread at the
end of the 16th century, as can be assumed by the Copia de Curatos ([1596] 1982)26
(cf. Torero 2002:467, 468). This document was made for Christian missionaries and
lists the languages that were spoken in the Altipiano villages, so that the missionaries
knew which language(s) to use for preaching. The Copia de Curatos mentions
Aymara, Quechua, Pukina, and Uruquilla, i.e. Uchumataqu and Chipaya, as the
languages that had to be used for missionary work (Torero 2002:468). Thus,
Uchumataqu as well as Chipaya must still have been of importance then.
      Part of the Uru population resisted Spanish domination and tried to maintain
their original lifestyle (together with their language), which is reported by Alonso22
   The area around Lake Titicaca, and which today forms part of the department La Paz
23
   Centred around the famous ruins of the same name

   By this process, the village of Santa Ana de Chipaya was founded m the 1 ö* century

   ""Les ha aprovechado la reducción para que coman pan y beban vino, y para la doctrina ha sido lo
principal Pero verlos antes que amanezca en sus balsas de totora, casi desnudos, navegar y pescar [. ] ""
The meaning of amanezca, which is translated as the verb 'dawn', is not entirely certain. It may refer, in a
somewhat poetic style, to the time before the Spanish conquerers arrived and brought what they
understood to be civilisation

Ramos Gavilân in the Historia del santuario de Nuestra Senora de Copacabana
([1621] 1988:82, 355). In August of 1618, a group of Urn fortified an island in the
mouth of the Desaguadero River near Cepita and denied access to the Spanish,
defending their place of retreat with arms. They also went plundering on nearby
estates and villages. The Uru were eventually defeated by Miguel de Andrada, but
this shows that at least parts of the Uru population tried to escape reductions,
aymaricisation and hispanicisation.
      This struggle for independence made it possible for some Uru groups to
maintain their traditional lifestyle and language, an aspect remarked upon by e.g.
Reginaldo de Lizârraga Descripción breve de toda la tierra del Peru ([1608] 1968)
and Antonio Vazquez de Espinosa Compendio y descripción de las Indias
Occidentales ([1628] 1948). However, violent actions, the completely different
lifestyle of the Uru together with their distinct language created a negative attitude
towards them. Lizarraga ([1608] 1968:67, translation mine) characterises the Uru as
""most barbaric people, with a language different from all others of the mainland and
from that of the Inca; they understood it very little, they knew it little, [...].""27. A
similar view is uttered by Antonio de Castro y del Castillo, author of the Descripción
del Obispado de la Paz ([1651] 1906:201, 202, translation mine): ""they are like the
others, but less cultured; they fish and cruise the bay with balsa rafts [...].""28.
      In sum, the arrival of the Spanish and the colonial administration fuelled a
process that had already begun in pre-Spanish times, namely the Urus' forced
adaptation to a farming lifestyle, which brought with it the loss of their language.
However, parts of the Uru resisted this process and managed to maintain their
lifestyle, for which, however, they were despised by other indigenous groups and the
Spanish. Thus, by the second half of the 17th century, Uru groups living a traditional
life became more and more scattered, the contact between southern groups around
Lakes Coipasa and Ροορό and the Titicaca region was probably severly interrupted,
and whenever they had to make contact with outsiders they had to use Aymara (or
sometimes Quechua). This situation may be regarded as the base for the further decay
of the Uru culture.","[31, 32, 33, 34]"
"4.2.5.1.2 Question marker -ta
The question marker -ta requires some additional comments. In Uhle (1894), its
regular use is testified but in later documents it is found less and less. In Vellard
(1967) -ta is used only occasionally on the interrogative pronoun kasu, but otherwise
does not appear any more. In Muysken (2005) it has entirely vanished. Therefore, the
following statements are based mainly on Uhle's data.
     The question marker -ta is mostly attached to the interrogative pronoun, less
often to a personal pronoun, and hardly ever to the subject of a phrase. It is not used
obligatorily, and we find a general tendency to delete the question marker -ta after
case marking suffixes on interrogative pronouns when these appear at the beginning
of a phrase (e.g. example 99) (cf. Uhle 1894:55). Accordingly, there is a tendency to
employ -ta on pure interrogative stems (119) and often the element which -ta is
attached to is not positioned at the beginning of a phrase (97). The use of -ta seems to
be reinforcing rather than purely marking an utterance as interrogative.

According to Vellard (1967:26) -ki and -xwi are interrogative particles. The use of
-xwi is limited to the work of Vellard (1949-67) and does not occur in other
documents. Despite its uncertain origin it is clear that -xwi is not a loan from Aymara
or Quechua.

              what name you-QTP
              'What is your name?' (lit: 'What name is yours?') (Vellard 1967:19)
Although Vellard labelled -ki a question marker, it appears in declarative clauses, too.
Furthermore, interrogative clauses are regularly built without -ki. The same is true for
-xwi: the majority of interrogative clauses is constructed without it (tab. 4.13),
although it is worth to note that -xwi is restricted to interrogative clauses. Neither -ki
nor -xwi are attached to the interrogative pronoun itself (tab. 4.14 and 4.15). These
aspects point into the direction that none of these elements is a question marking
suffix. Instead, -ki might be seen as the topic marker.
      Both morphemes show a tendency to occur on nouns and pronouns and they
appear in complementary distribution. It is the last point that gives rise to the
assumption that -xwi may well be an allomorph of Topic marker -ki. It then has to be
glossed as question bound topic marker (QTP) since its scope is strictly limited to
interrogative clauses. If -xwi is an allomorph of topic marker -ki, there has been a  For the difference between apa and ep, cf. 3.6 4

phonological shift from the plosive Ikl to a labialised fricative /xw/. What induced this
shift is uncertain but we may assume that it is at least in part due to the attrition of
Uchumataqu.
      Vellard (1967) presents three examples which may be interpreted as instances of
the question bound topic marker, although their form differs from this suffix (121).
However, since these instances occur only in interrogative clauses, I propose a
reading as the question bound topic marker.(121)          culu si-si-n-aki        wir-xo

4.3 Adjectives
The core function of adjectives is to qualify a noun, but for many languages it is
problematic to state whether they have a separate class of adjectives or not.
Adjectives sometimes stand between nouns and verbs, and in many languages
concepts that in other languages are expressed as adjectives are encoded as either
nouns or verbs; and often the situation is not entirely clear.
     In Uchumataqu, adjectival concepts are in general not encoded as verbs429, but
the situation is not so clear when it comes to the difference between nouns and
adjectives. In the following I will discuss whether Uchumataqu has a separate class
of adjectives or not 430 .
     There are some morphosyntactic and semantic means to state whether a
language has adjectives. The most common way to do so is to look at morphology,' l29 In fact, there are at least two adjectival concepts that are encoded verbally. These are 'to be tired' oc-
and 'to be ill' asi- Maybe also the notion of 'to be sad' is expressed verbally but there the situation is not
entirely clear. These cases are viewed as exceptions but not as a general means to express adjectival
concepts.
""""This discussion is limited to ""descriptive adjectives"" because ""limiting adjectives"" (Dixon 1982:3) as
numbers and expressions such as 'this','other', or 'much' behave morphologically different (cf 4 2 3;
4.3.4, 4.4)
198                       UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
i.e. do nominal markers also attach to adjectival concepts? Or are adjectival concepts
morphologically marked distinctly from nouns?
      As Croft (2003:185) points out for a theory of markedness, adjectives are
prototypically morphologically unmarked in modifying position, but they are marked
when used as nouns or in predicative function. Nouns, on the other hand, derived
from adjectives are marked as derivations, e.g. 'happi-ness' in English (2003:185).
Another characteristic of adjectives is their ability to function in comparative
constructions (Schachter 1985:14).
      With regard to semantics Dixon (1982:13) points out that if a language has
adjectives at all, at least the concepts of dimension (e.g. tall), colour (e.g. red) and
value (e.g. good) as a universal tendency, will be encoded as adjectives ('Languages
that have only a limited class of adjectives show considerable similarity in the
concepts that are expressed through adjectives.' Dixon 1982:3). Furthermore, if there
exists a class of adjectives there tend to be antonyms.
      In Uchumataqu, adjectival concepts are not marked for case suffixes or the
plural marker -naka. The only morphological markers they have in common with
nouns are clausal clitics such as declarative -cay and Topic marker -ki.
      With regard to morphological marking, adjectival concepts in a modifying
position usually do not take morphological markers at all. In predicative function
they often take the predicator -kasi (cf. 4.3.2.1), which also occurs on e.g. manner
adverbs, such as e.g. nisu-kasi 'so' 431 . Adjectives can be further modified by adverbs.
      The adverb iya 'more' is used to increase the degree of the meaning embodied in
an adjectival concept and in this sense contributes to some kind of comparison (122).
For true comparisons between two entities separative -kistana is used (cf. 4.1.1.4).
(122)        wata      iya-cay       aski-n
             village more-DEC far-?
             'The village is further away.'                   (Métraux 1935:104)
With respect to semantics, no nouns derived from adjectives could be found in
Uchumataqu but there are lexically distinct words for semantically related concepts
such as 'the cold', hipu and '(to be) cold', saki. This is evidence of a separate class of
adjectives. There are also antonym pairs among adjectival concepts in Uchumataqu,
e.g. coq, 'great' and uca, 'small, little'. With regard to morphology, the antonym
pairs behave similarly to each other and to other typical adjectival concepts as e.g.
value (cf. Table 4.17). The concepts proposed by Dixon (1982:13) as universally
apparent if a language has adjectives at all, appear mostly as modifiers in
Uchumataqu. As such, they do not take any special morphological markers but are
mostly inflected with -kasi when they occur in predicative function. The expression
cuni 'good' can function as an adjective as well as an adverb (cf. 6.1.4).
     As one can see from Table 4.16, most of the criteria are fulfilled by Uchumataqu
so one can speak of a separate class of adjectives found in this language. I propose an
open class of adjectives (Dixon 1982) because no restricting mechanisms can be
431
    In Uchumataqu, adverbs stand between nouns and adjectives and some adverbs can therefore be
inflected with the predicator -kasi For a more detailed discussion, cf 6.1.

stated. But I would also like to point out that there is no clear-cut distinction and that
there are some exceptions where adjectival concepts are encoded as either nouns or
verbs (e.g. oc-u 'I am tired', lit: 'I do tire' Uhle: 1894:89.1).","[213, 214, 215, 216]"
"1.4.2.5.4 Vellard 1967
Vellard's article Contribution al estudio de la lengua Uru was published in 1967120.
Vellard himself does not provide any introductory notes, but instead, the brief
introduction is written by Salvador Bucca, who points out that the edition is to be
understood as a complement to Vellard's preceding work on the Uru (1949-1951).
However, the consultation of them is recommended in order to fully comprehend this
edition. The editor also points to phonological variation apparent in the texts. Apart
from this, no further information is provided on how and when the data were
obtained or on the editing process. It thus remains uncertain whether Vellard himself
carried out the translation, analysis, and interpretation of the data or whether another
researcher was involved. The document was published in Spanish in Buenos Aires.
     Although not mentioned explicitly, it becomes apparent in the footnotes that the
language consultants were Manuel and Luis Inta and Carlos Kispe. Luis Inta is
described as ""a mestizo who speaks a very incorrect language""121 (Vellard 1967:36,

translation mine). Dates on pp. 36 and 37 point to the possibility that the data were
collected in 1942 and 1944, except for the data provided by Luis Inta, which
probably come from 1952 (Vellard 1967:34, 36, 37). However, as a footnote (Vellard
1967:36) states the prayers ""Confesión"" and ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" were
recorded nearly ten years after Vellard's first field-work campaign, which, if this
were true, would have been in 1948. This does not correspond to the dates proposed
in table 1.4, for which I am unable to provide an explanation. As usually, no
information on the duration of Vellard's field-work is given.
     The data consist mainly of single clauses and only in some cases do more
comprehensive sequences occur, such as question and response. The clauses are of
varying length and complexity and include imperative and interrogative clauses as
well (Vellard 1967:1-24). They are all provided with a word-by-word as well as free
translation. This section is followed by a sample of adverbs and conjunctions
(Vellard 1967:24-26) and interrogative pronouns (Vellard 1967:26). These
grammatical observations are continued by a brief overview of some suffixes, which
are called ""particles with prepositional force""122 (Vellard 1967:27, translation mine),
whose use is further exemplified by clauses (Vellard 1967:28-32). This part is
followed by some basic grammatical observations, which deal with e.g. reduplication
as a means of reinforcement or the meaning of cuki 'let us' in imperative clauses
(Vellard 1967:33). The subsequent data were provided by Luis Inta and consist of a
question and the response to it as well as of the prayers mentioned above. A footnote
to ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" states that this prayer is a somewhat corrupted
Aymara version (Vellard 1967:35, footnote 2)' 23 . The article concludes with a
comparison of numerals (Vellard 1967:36, 37). The first comparison comprises
numerals 1 to 10 supplied by Manuel Inta124 compared to numerals as provided by
Posnansky and numerals 1 to 5 from Tiwanaku. The entire comparison is titled
""ancient numeration of the Titicaca region (as remembered by some old people)""125
(Vellard 1967:36, translation mine). A next comparison comprises numerals 1 to 10
from the ""Uru of Irohito""126, Chipaya, and Puquina, following Ore (1607). It is
noteworthy that the numerals given by Manuel Inta and those under the heading of
""Uru of Irohito"" are not identical, although the numerals from Irohito are congruent
with the rest of my data (cf. 4.4). Finally, numerals 1 to 10 from Aymara and
Quechua are compared. Some of the clauses published in 1967 had already appeared
in earlier works of Vellard, mainly that of 1949.
     With respect to evaluation we find a situation similar to the one from 1949, i.e.
most of the data can be verified when compared to e.g. Uhle or Métraux. However, as
already indicated for 1949, the amount of Aymara loan words and grammatical
elements is higher than that in other sources and we find a certain degree of
phonological variation. The data provided by Luis Inta are hardly analysable at all.
The grammatical analysis, interpretation, and translation are only in part

understandable and not always consistent. That is, in some cases the data and their
analysis and interpretation are best considered separately from each other. The data
themselves are as informative and reliable as those from e.g. Vellard 1949.
     Although Vellard mentions only some of his visits (cf. table 1.4), particularly
those during which he had collected linguistic data, it becomes obvious from
footnotes, etc. that he was in Irohito several times. The following table is an attempt
to summarise the dates of Vellard's visits and the sources for this information.

Table 1.4· Overview of Vellard's visits to Irohito1.4.2.6 Final remarks
Although the personal backgrounds of the researchers presented above are highly
divergent and most of them did not have any intensive contact with each other, the
52                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
data collected are consistent to a considerable degree. That is, the grammatical
materials provided by Uhle (1894) and Métraux (1935) are very well comparable and
confirm each other's results, which is also true with respect to the lexical material
collected by Polo (1901) and Lehmann (1929). It is only with Vellard's data that we
find a certain difference with regard to the results of the preceding studies, which can
be ascribed to an increasing influence of Aymara and the de facto extinction of
Uchumataqu. It is one of the tragedies of the language that the first researchers
studied Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already highly
endangered, unfortunately left hardly any information on their language consultants,
etc. Therefore, we know virtually nothing about their field trip experiences. Vellard
was the only researcher who bothered to introduce his language consultants and
provided background information on his field-work. However, Vellard visited Irohito
when the community and its language had as good as vanished. Despite these less
favourable circumstances the data found in the several documents can be regarded as
a reliable and highly informative source on Uchumataqu.
      Certain restrictions have to be taken into consideration when dealing with the
sources on Uchumataqu. Although not always mentioned explicitly, we have to
assume that data collection required the use of three languages: Spanish, Aymara,
and Uchumataqu. This gives plenty of room for interference on the language
consultant's as well as on the interpreter's and researcher's parts. Furthermore, none
of the language consultants, interpreters, or researchers was a native speaker of
Spanish127.
      It also has to be taken into consideration that only Uhle had professional
linguistic training, while the other researchers were either social anthropologists or
even came from completely unrelated disciplines. For them, the recording of
Uchumataqu was rather a sideline in their career, which they did not further pursue
(except Vellard)128. This leads to the observation that all researchers lived in a time
when the idea of academic research differed considerably from that of present-day
research. Even those researchers who did not have linguistic or anthropological
training considered themselves qualified to collect linguistic data, a consideration
originating in the old idea of the 'all-round scientist'. Furthermore, there were no
standards or a unified methodology for language documentation and description and
thus, every researcher used his own techniques and methodology. Particularly Uhle
was influenced by a Latin-based grammar model, which he tried to apply to
Uchumataqu. Furthermore, most researchers tried and compared Uchumataqu to
Aymara and, to a lesser degree, to Quechua, which does not yield satisfying results,
particularly with respect to the verbal system. This bias towards a standardised
(Andean) grammar model resulted in turning the language consultant's information
into what was thought appropriate by the researcher, as in the case of Uhle.
     Other aspects that today would be considered inadequate are the short periods of
time spent in the language community as well as the collaboration with only one or
two persons. The average time spent in Irohito was about one week129, which is     With the exception of Polo and Palavecino
     Cf. Muysken and Hannß (2006 218)
     With the exception of Vellard.
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                              53
hardly sufficient to document a language in depth. Thus, particularly complex
features of the language, such as e.g. the verbal system, could not be explored in
detail, even if they were (more or less) fully functional at the time of documentation.
      When talking about language consultants we have to consider that probably
most or all of them would have been men. That is, all the researchers were men and it
is likely that they got into contact with men first and due to the short time they spent
in Irohito could not intensify their contact with women. Therefore, potential gender
distinctions and / or gender related speech130 may have been impossible to record.
The only exception is Vellard, who mentions women among his language consultants
and reports so-called ""phrases d'amour"" (Vellard 1951:21, 22), in which a woman's
speech is recorded.
      It should be emphasised once more that Uchumataqu has been an endangered
language at every stage of its documentation and description, and in the case of
Vellard it has to be regarded as almost extinct. This is of course crucial to the
analysis and interpretation of the data since even in the earliest documents most
complex structures were already simplified, used incorrectly, have simply vanished,
and / or have been replaced by Aymara. These processes explain why in some cases
there are limited, contradictory or even no data at all on particular phenomena. The
process of language death as well as the in part insufficient data collection impose
some considerable restrictions on the data.
      Finally, the researchers were influenced by political and social circumstances.
This is particularly the case for researchers of late 19th century, when the so-called
""War for the Pacific"" (1879-1884) was fought between Chile, Peru, and Bolivia
(Loza 2004:22). This war was followed by rebellions of the indigenous population
against Spanish domination during a time when Uhle was at the Lake Titicaca region
(Loza 2004:23). The rebellions themselves were a kind of prelude to the so-called
""Federal War"" between 1898 and 1899 (ibid.), a time when Polo, too, carried out his
research. Another example of the influence of external factors is that Vellard's final
visit to Irohito in 1952 coincided with a revolt of farmers, miners, and students who
succeeded in installing a new government131. Thus, the political atmosphere was at
times less favourable for European researchers to visit and work in indigenous
communities and might have prevented further studies.
     After having evaluated the sources with respect to their reliability and usefulness
for a grammatical description, I will provide an overview of the numerical
contribution of each document to the amount of data (cf. tab. 1.5). Column Β
provides numbers on purely lexical material as given in word lists, which excludes
Vellard 1949 and 1967. Column C offers the amount of words found in phrases,
clauses, and texts, therefore excluding Bacarreza (1910), Posnansky (1934), LaBarre
(1941), and Palavecino (1949) while in D an overview of the total number of words
in each source is supplied. Columns E and G show the proportion of their
contribution to the whole corpus of data.","[66, 67, 68, 69, 70]"
"3.2 Typological classification
Uchumataqu can be characterised as a moderately agglutinating language. Based on
the syntactic notion of word, a count of affixes per word results in the following
table. This counting was based on Vellard (1949), who is the only one to provide
entire texts and thus, instances of natural speech.
     As shown in table 3.1, nominal, pronominal, adverbial, and adjectival stems are
either zero marked or tend to have only one grammatical morpheme attached. Verbal
stems, however, mainly carry at least one grammatical morpheme, but generally they
have two morphemes attached. Particles and numerals have a tendency to be zero
marked. Thus, the overall picture is somewhat different from Aymara and Quechua,
which generally show a higher number of affixes per word. However, like Quechua
and Aymara, Uchumataqu can be likewise classified as an agglutinating language.

Table 3.1: Number of affixes per word
Criteria for defining a language as agglutinating are provided by Comrie (1981:40):
a) morpheme boundaries are clear-cut within a word, b) morphemes have an invariant
shape. Both these main criteria are fulfilled by Uchumataqu, as demonstrated by
examples (12) and (13).
(12) a.     lax-0-cay                            '(s)he plunges'
            la[x]-ku-cay216                      '(s)he had plunged'
            lak-aki-cay                          '(s)he will plunge'             (Vellard 1951:27)
            okwa-0-cay                           'you (sg) go'
            okwa-ku-cay211                       'you (sg) had gone'
            ok"" a-aki-cay                        'you (sg) will go'              (Vellard 1951:37)
(13)       pi.la                                 'pampa, sand'
           pi.la-naka                            'pampas'                        (Lehmann 1929b:21)
           kuya                                  'house'
           kuyaf-Jnaka                           'houses'                        (Vellard 1967:7, 20)
In each of the examples, morpheme boundaries are clear-cut, which makes it possible
to establish e.g. okwa- as a verbal stem and -aki as a morpheme attached to it. To each
of these suffixes, a meaning can be unequivocally assigned, e.g. -aki marks future
tense and -naka expresses plural. Further, the shape of the morphemes remains
mainly unaltered278 and recognisable, regardless of whether they are attached to e.g. a276
    The elision of/x/ is probably caused by following -ku
277
    Vellard provided only okwa-ku-cay as an example for first person singular and added ""etc"" Thus, the
form of second person singular is based on my interpretation
278
    Except for smaller adjustments to the phonological environment, which may result in allophones, as is
the case with e.g subject relativiser -ni and its allophone -m, which can be conditioned by following high
front vowel /i/
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                 133
transitive or intransitive verb. These features sufficiently satisfy the requirements for
establishing Uchumataqu as an agglutinating language279.
      However, although the overall profile of Uchumataqu is that of an agglutinating
language, there are features reminiscent of either fusional or isolating language types.
It is particularly in the verbal system that portmanteau morphemes, characteristic for
fusional languages, are found. Thus, -u not only marks present tense but it also refers
to first person singular as does -a, marking future tense with first person singular.
Similar observations are made for the so-called In-Group Marker -acu, which
expresses first person plural exclusive and present tense, and habitual present tense
Marker -in I -ni, which encodes both a temporal (present tense) and aspectual
(Habitual) notion. Thus, these suffixes comprise two categories, mainly tense and
person marking ""to give a single, unsegmentable morph"" (Comrie 1981:41).
Furthermore, Uchumataqu has some isolating tendencies, particularly in the
pronominal system, where no difference is expressed between e.g. a pronominal
subject and a possessive pronoun280, as in (14) and (15):(14)       am qoya
           you house
           'your (sg) house'                                          (Uhle 1894:46)·
(15)       am ok tafnj-ni
           you go hunt-SR
           'you (sg) go hunting (lit.: 'you go as a hunter')' (Uhle 1894:94.1)
These differences with respect to typical agglutinating languages, such as Aymara
and Quechua, have already been observed by Muysken (2000:104) and, as Comrie
(1981:43) points out ""the majority (perhaps all) of the world's languages do not
correspond exactly to one or other of these types [i.e. isolating, agglutinating, or
fusional KH]"".","[148, 149, 150]"
"1.1.3 Aymara, Spanish, and Quechua influence
Aymara is the language that had most influence on Uchumataqu, while Spanish
contributes mainly lexical items to the language, and Quechua can be regarded as
exerting only a minor influence. In some cases it is difficult or even impossible to
determine whether a feature is a loan or an areal phenomenon shared by many
Andean languages, since we have to take into consideration that these three
languages were neighbours for centuries or even millenia. I will discuss this further
below (cf. 1.3).
     In Uchumataqu, influence from other languages is found mainly in the
phonology and morphology and, of course, its lexicon. I will first present loan
phenomena in phonology before turning to a brief description of morphological and
lexical loans.
     One of the most remarkable changes brought forward by an increasing Aymara
influence is the reduction of the formerly 5-vowel system of Uchumataqu to a 3-
vowel system of the Aymara (and Quechua) type, i.e. from /a/, /e/, /il, lol, and /u/
reduced to /a/, HI, and Iwl (cf. Muysken 2001:82).
     In other aspects of phonology, Spanish exerted influence on Uchumataqu.
Among the few sounds that are maintained in Spanish loan words are [b], [g], and [f],
although in the majority of all cases, loan words are adapted to Uchumataqu
phonology. These changes affect mainly sounds from Spanish loan words, but are
also applied to Aymara or Quechua words if their structure violates a phonological
rule of Uchumataqu. Thus, Aymara lluchu 'cap', for example, is changed to lukcu
(Polo 1901:470) since Uchumataqu does not allow [11] in word initial position. For a
more detailed description, cf. 2.6.
     When looking at the bound grammatical morphemes of Uchumataqu, one finds
only a relatively small number that are actually borrowed from Aymara or Quechua.
Among the more recent loans we find affirmative -pini, whose use is testified only in
the material of Vellard9 (1949-1967), intensifier -paca, and plural marking -naka
used on personal pronouns. Other possibly less recent loans are resultative -t,
terminative -kama and benefactive -taki.",[25]
"6.1.4 Verbal degree
The next subclass of adverbs to be discussed is labelled 'verbal degree'. According to
Schachter (1985:20), adverbs that modify other adverbs or adjectives express degree.
However, the adverbs called 'verbal degree' modify verbs but although express
degree and not, for instance, manner. We find the following adverbs among this
subclass: wa/z'581 'much, very', cuni 'much', yuki 'much', ipa 'little, less', and
possibly sina 'only'. All of them also occur as modifiers of adverbs or adjectives and
both cuni and yuki can function as adverbs and as adjectives582 (see 4.3). However,
although yuki 'much' is homonym to yuki 'before, in front of (and thereby also to
yuki 'face'), it seems unlikely that these forms would be related but are rather
homonym. In most cases, adverbs expressing verbal degree are not inflected.
(18)           wali hisk-n-u-cay             xoxa
               much frighten-OB2-lSG-DEC thunder
               'The thunder frightens me much.'                         (Vellard 1949:166)
 10
      For further discussion of the morpheme combination -aca-[a]ki, cf. 5 8 2.2.

      As waki, wall is a loan from Aymara (DeLucca 1983:444).

      In this function cum is translated as 'good' instead of 'much' as is done here.

If these adverbs take morphological markers, they are either adjectival, i.e. predicator
-kasi (19), or clausal, e.g. affirmative -pini (20).
(19)        ipa-kafsi]     selx-cay
            little-PRE     be-DEC
            'There is little.'                                     (Métraux 1935:103)
(20)        am wirakuca cuni-pini pek-u-cay
            you white_man much-AFF want-lSG-DEC
            'I want [=love] you very much, white man.' (Vellard 1951:21)
As with other adverbial subclasses, there is an exception from the general coding
pattem. According to Métraux (1935:91), the expression for 'enough' is either
lukukasi or nukukal (21), Muysken (2005:46) also lists nukukasi (22). No instance is
found where a form *nuku or *luku appears on its own and thus, we may assume that
the expressions are lexicalised.
(21)        nukukal pek-u-cay
            enough want-lSG-DEC
            'I want enough.'                                       (Métraux 1935:91)
(22)        nukukasi liks
            enough drink
            'We drink enough.'                                     (Muysken 2005:46)
The element *-kal on nukukal is reminiscent of verbal certainty -kala (cf. 5.9) which
would be a remarkable deviation from the pattem proposed here since in all other
cases, adverbs behave as either nouns or adjectives but not as verbs. It is not entirely
certain whether *-kal is indeed related to verbal certainty -kala or whether it is some
other form which was probably not productive any more at the time of
documentation.","[273, 274]"
"6.1.3 Adverbs of manner
In most languages, manner adverbs form the largest group of adverbs. However, for
Uchumataqu only a comparatively small number of manner adverbs can be
established which may be due to the documentary situation. Among these adverbs are
asta and loaloa both meaning 'quickly', untu 'hard, strong', and ina 'in vain'. In
contrast to the adverbial subclasses discussed above, manner adverbs are combined
with adjectival morphology, i.e. predicator -kasi (13) and they take clausal clitics,
such as declarative -cay or affirmative -pini (14).
(13)        ops-kasi   (a)pa:-ta-ni
            secret-PRE make-RES-SR
            'That which is done secretly.'                           (Métraux 1935:107)
( 14)       untu-pini k 'au-k 'awa-aca-cay
            hard-AFF cry-cry-iR-DEC
            '(S)he [probably] cries very hard.'579                   (Vellard 1951:24)
579
   Vellard (ibid.) translated the clause as habitual, i.e. the author analysed -aca as habitual marker instead
of irrealis. Thus, we do not know what kind of irrealis -aca denotes here and the translation offered here is
rather speculative For further discussion, see 5.8.2.6.
256                              UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
However, in most cases, manner adverbs are not inflected at all (15).
(15)           loaloa ton-aki-cay wat[a]-kina
               quick come-FU-DEC village-DlR
               'You will come very quickly to the village.' (Métraux 1935:109)
The expression ina 'in vain' demands some discussion. It can take predicator -kasi
but it also takes the forms -ci and -kacu. The element -ci may be the nominal
possessive marker -ci (cf. 4.1.2.1) in which case ina would be an exception from the
general adjectival coding pattern. The element -ci appears only on elicited, singular
items and when ina occurs within a clause, it is not inflected with -ci (16).
(16)           has    ina     ki-aca-kiSB0
               now in_vain speak-IR-TOP
               'Now, (s)he may speak in vain.'                          (Métraux 1935:98)
The following is the only example clause that contains the element -kacu.
(17)           ni     hina-kacu oxk-cay
               (s)he in vain-? go-DEC
               '(S)he goes in vain.'                                    (Vellard 1951:13)
It may be possible that -kacu developed from the alternative form of predicator -kasi
which is -kaci (cf. 4.3.3) by way of final vowel deletion and co-articulation. In this
case, final /if of -kaci would have been deleted and co-articulation may have led to
the form -kacu. If this is true, it would be a further proof of the adjectival nature of
ina. In this case, an inflection with nominal possessive -ci seems unlikely and the
form -ci has to remain uncertain.","[272, 273]"

Table 4.11: Overview of indefinite pronouns4.2.5 Interrogative pronouns
Uchumataqu has four basic interrogative pronouns:
           culu      'what? how?'           hek       'who?'
           kasu      'how many?'            xas       'where?'
A word must be said about the interrogative pronoun 'where'. Its representation in
the sources differs so that we find the following forms: haxsi (Uhle 1894), xasik(i)
(Métraux 1935), axsi (Vellard 1967), and jas (Muysken 2005). I have decided to
represent it as xas, which is closest to the spelling represented in the sources, which
suggest that xas starts with a fricative of velar quality. Thus, when not referring to a
particular example, I will represent 'where?' as xas.
     There are three lexicalised derivations of the interrogative pronoun culu 'what'.
It can be combined with comitative -stani, separative -kistana, or directional -kina to
build cul-stani, cul-kistana, or cul-kina 'why'419 (cf. 4.1.3; 4.1.1.5; 4.1.1.1 ).",[209]
"634
    There are exceptions from this rule, which make up 5,26% of all information questions I consider them
to be misinterpretations and thus, will not treat them as regular instances of Uchumataqu interrogative
clauses.
635
    The form of the interrogative pronoun hekis 'who1'' differs from the usual form hek. The difference
cannot be explained.
280                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
(48)       hek-stan(i) am am-ki     cis(i)             tafnj-ni ok-aki
           who-COM you you-TOP species_of_fish hunt-SR go-FU
           'Whom will you (sg) go hunting cisi fish with?' (Uhle 1894:94.1 )7.6.2 Yes /no questions
This type of interrogative clauses has no particular morphological features except for
the question bound topic marker -xwi.
(49)       uxk ni-stani     paku-xwi
           go (s)he-cOM dog-QTP
           'Did the dog go with him / her?'
           ('tEl hapartido con esteperro?'')                            (Vellard 1967:24)
A striking feature of yes / no questions is the use of declarative -cay. In general, there
is a slight tendency for the interrogative clauses to occur without this marker (50) but
it occurs regularly in non-verbal predicate clauses of any type (51).
(50)       ikan-si kumi pek         okwa-kalfaj pek
           rest-AN you     want go-CERT           want
           'Do you (sg) want a rest [or] do you want to go?' (Vellard 1949:169)
(51)       qotfaj-ksi sex ana-kfij sex-cay
           lake-LOC be NEO-TOP be-DEC
           'Are there (some) in the lake or are there not?'             (Uhle 1894:68.2)
However, declarative -cay is also used in clauses containg a full verbal predicate
although in such cases, the tendency is to occur without it.
(52)       ana tulun kun-tani okwfaj-aki-cay
            NEG grief      you-COM gO-FU-DEC
            'Won't you (sg) go with grief?' (lit.: 'Won't the grief go with you?')
                                                               (Vellard 1949:169)637
It is possible that the application of declarative -cay marks an increased certainty on
the speaker's side with respect to the answer. Thus, when the speaker believes to
know the answer, (s)he uses declarative -cay, whereas in a case when the answer
cannot be anticipated by the speaker declarative -cay is missing. If this proposition is
true, then example (50) would display a lack of certainty, i.e. it is unknown to the
speaker what his / her interlocutor may want. In example (52), however, a particular
answer may even be expected (namely, that Vellard would not leave easily) and thus,
the speaker feels able to use declarative -cay in his question.
      In some cases, declarative -cay and question bound topic marker -ki are
combined, which I regard as errors since these markers are generally mutually
exclusive (cf. 7.2). The answer to a yes / no question is the repetition of the verb, as
demonstrated in example (53a) and (b).","[296, 297]"

Samenvatting
De taal Uchumataqu werd ooit gesproken in de omgeving van het Titicacameer en
langs de bovenloop van de Desaguadero rivier, maar is rond 1950 uitgestorven. Het
onderwerp van dit onderzoek is de gemeenschap Irohito (Noordwest Bolivia). Dit
dorp was één van de laatste nederzettingen in het noorden van Bolivia waar de
bevolking Uchumataqu sprak. Het aantal sprekers is waarschijnlijk altijd vrij klein
geweest: waarschijnlijk nooit meer dan 150 sprekers. Het Uchumataqu vormt samen
met het gerelateerde dialect Chipaya de taalfamilie Uru-Chipaya. Deze wordt gezien
als een geïsoleerde taalfamilie.
      Verschillende onderzoekers hebben Irohito bezocht, totdat een ernstige droogte,
gedurende de jaren 40 van de 20e eeuw, een einde maakte aan het Uchumataqu als
een gesproken taal. De Duitse taalwetenschapper Max Uhle was de eerste die
linguïstische gegevens heeft verzameld in Irohito in 1894. Hij werd gevolgd door
José T. Polo, Zenón Bacarreza, Walter Lehmann, Alfred Métraux en Jehan (Jean)
Vellard. Vellard heeft als laatste gesproken Uchumataqu opgenomen. Het door Uhle
en Lehmann verzameld materiaal bleef ongepubliceerd. Recent onderzoek in de jaren
90 van de 20de eeuw en het begin van de 21ste eeuw werd uitgevoerd door Colette
Grinevald en Pieter Muysken.
      Dit boek bevat de eerste grondige beschrijving van het Uchumataqu waarbij
ieder onderzoek, gepubliceerd of ongepubliceerd, naar het Uchumataqu wordt
betrokken. Dit onderzoek is gebaseerd op de voorheen genoemde onderzoeken en de
gegevens die daarin zijn verzameld. Observaties over de huidige situatie in Irohito
werden verkregen gedurende een veldonderzoekdoor de auteur. Het veldwerk werd
uitgevoerd in Irohito.
      In hoofdstuk 1 worden de sociale, geografische en historische achtergronden van
Irohito en het Uchumataqu beschreven. De genetische verwantschap binnen de Uru-
Chipaya taalfamilie wordt bediscussieerd en Uchumataqu en Chipaya worden met
elkaar vergeleken. Hierna wordt een korte beschrijving gegeven van het theoretisch
kader en de gebruikte terminologie voor de grammaticale beschrijving, gevolgd door
een overzicht van de geschiedenis van Irohito. Het laatste gedeelte van het hoofdstuk
gaat in op de studies die als grondslag voor dit boek gebruikt zijn.
   Hoofdstuk 2 gaat over het fonologische systeem van het Uchumataqu. De
medeklinkers en klinkers worden eerst geïntroduceerd, waama de klanken die in
leenwoorden voorkomen worden behandeld. Dit wordt gevolgd door de presentatie
van contextgevoelige processen. Binnen deze processen komt elisie van finale
klinkers het meest voor en leidt vaak tot verdere contextgevoelige processen. De
lettergreep en het klemtoonpatroon worden gepresenteerd voordat de representatie en
orthografie worden behandeld. Ik laat tot slot zien hoe de fonemen en allofonen van
het Uchumataqu in de manuscripten worden gepresenteerd.
      Hoofdstuk 3 geeft een overzicht van de morfologische processen. De termen
wortel, stam en woord worden behandeld voordat affixatie, clitische elementen,
samenstellingen, incorporatie en reduplicatie worden gepresenteerd. In het tweede
deel van hoofdstuk 3 worden de zinsdelen van Uchumataqu geïntroduceerd.
      In hoofdstuk 4 wordt het nominale systeem beschreven. Het begint met een
beschrijving van de nominale markeerders en de persoonlijke voornaamwoorden van
Uchumataqu Daarna worden de beschrijvende voornaamwoorden geïntroduceerd In
tegenstelling tot andere Andestalen heeft Uchumataqu een aparte klasse van
adjectieven Deze omvat twee subcategorieën kwantificerende adjectieven en
adjectieven van toestand In het laatste deel van het hoofdstuk wordt het numeneke
systeem beschreven
      Hoofdstuk 5 gaat in op het verbale systeem Het begint met de markering van
tijd, die opmerkelijk is, omdat Uchumataqu alleen de eerste persoon enkelvoud in de
tegenwoordige en toekomstige tijd apart markeert, terwijl alle andere personen
ongemarkeerd zijn Na de beschnjving van tijd volgt een presentatie van de
aspectuele affixen, waarvan slechts dne werden gevonden Dit relatief kleine aantal is
mogelijk het gevolg van taalverhes en de methoden van dataverzameling Binnen de
aspectuele affixen vinden we een prefix, dat tegenwoordig is gelexicaliseerd Na een
korte presentatie van het koppelwerkwoord worden de markeerders voor subject en
object geïntroduceerd Binnen die groep vinden we een ander prefix, een
subjectmarkeerder, dat nog productief gebruikt werd ten tijde van de documentatie
Het gebruik van prefixen in een Andestaal is opmerkelijk en niet bekend van het
Aymara of Quechua De causatieve markeerder wordt kort beschreven voordat de
nominahsatie- en onderschikkingsmarkeerders worden behandeld De begrippen van
modus en modaliteit worden geïntroduceerd in de daaropvolgende sectie In het
laatste gedeelte van het hoofdstuk wordt het validatieve suffix besproken
     Hoofdstuk 6 gaat in op bijwoorden, postposities en het negatiepartikel In
Uchumataqu worden temporale en ruimtelijke bijwoorden en bijwoorden van wijze
gecodeerd als zelfstandige naamwoorden, terwijl bijwoorden van graad en
bijwoorden die bijwoorden en adjectieven modificeren, zich gedragen als
adjectieven In het daaropvolgende deel worden de postposities behandeld Daarna
wordt het negatiepartikel gepresenteerd Uchumataqu heeft een negatiepartikel, dat
woorden, constituenten en hele zinnen ontkennend kan maken
     In hoofdstuk 7 worden de verschillende zinstypes van het Uchumataqu
beschreven Het hoofdstuk begint met een presentatie van clitische elementen,
waarvan de persoonlijke chtica uniek zijn in het Andesgebied Het volgende deel gaat
over de basale zinstypes declaratieve, imperatieve en vragende zinnen Daarna
worden predicatieve zinnen geïntroduceerd Dit wordt gevolgd door een behandeling
van complexe zinnen nevengeschikte zinnen, complementszinnen, adverbiale zinnen
en relatieve zinnen

This book is the first comprehensive grammatical description of Uchumataqu, the lost
language of the Uru of Lake Titicaca in northwest Bolivia. Uchumataqu forms part of
the isolated Uru-Chipaya language family, which was influenced to different degrees
by Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish. The Uchumataqu language became extinct around
1950 and although several researchers had documented the language during the first
half of the 20th century, their results were never considered in a comprehensive
context. Some of the more substantial studies remained unpublished.
         This grammatical description is based on previous publications and archival
materials and provides the most complete treatment of Uchumataqu to date. The
study also comprises a detailed description of the data source situation as well as
a thorough introduction to previous research that resulted in the database for the
present book. In addition, it contains a description of the phonological system and
the morphological processes of Uchumataqu. The nominal and verbal systems are
discussed in detail. Particular attention is paid to the complex person-marking system,
of which the person-marking clitics distinguish Uchumataqu from the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Other important topics are nominalisation and
subordination strategies and the existence of a separate word class for adjectives.
The relationship between Uchumataqu and the surrounding Aymara and Quechua
languages is described in detail.
          This book will appeal especially to historical linguists, typologists and Andean
linguists, but it should also interest anthropologists, Americanists, and linguists in
general. In addition to its academic value, this book is a physical record of the extinct
Uchumataqu language for the descendants of its speakers.

"1.4.2.2 José T. Polo (1841-1918)
José Toribio Polo was bom in Ica in 1841 and went to Lima to study history at the
Convictorio de San Carlos and the Seminary of Santo Toribio but never completed
his studies there69 (Dager Alva 2000:147, footnote 48). Beside other occupations, he
worked at the Archive del Cabildo eclesiastico, the Tribunal de Cuentas, and the
Biblioteca Nacional, of which he was subdirector (Dager Alva 2000:137, footnote 3).
Polo died in Lima in 1918.
     According to Polo's profession the introduction to his work Indios uros del Peru
y Bolivia (1901) contains a detailed compilation of notes on the Uru in historical
sources, including a comparison of the historical representation of Cunza, Puquina,
and Uru (pp. 445-455). Since at that time Uchumataqu was considered to be identical
with or related to the historical Puquina mentioned by Ore (1607), Polo provides a
comparative word lists of Puquina-Uchumataqu-Spanish, which consists of twenty
items and includes the numerals 1-10 (p. 456). This list is followed by a Puquina
version of the Lord's Prayer (p. 456). Polo also adds a brief comparative word list
Atacameno-Uchumataqu of only seven items (p. 457). The following etymological
discussion of the name 'Uro' (p. 457) as well as some anthropological considerations
(pp. 459-463) are also dominated by historical considerations. These aspects make up
more than half of Polo's work on the Uru.
     The Uchumataqu-Spanish word list (pp. 464-479) itself consists of about 300
words, which are ordered according to the Spanish alphabet. It comprises nouns of
    As Dager Alva (2000.147) points out, at this time historiography was not a subject with an academic
tradition and it still lacked a unified methodology. Correspondingly, Dager Alva (2000:135) describes Polo
as belonging to a ""generation of historians in transition between an amateur-like history and a more
professional one""69. Regardless of these restrictions, Polo can be characterised as a historiographer and his
first and foremost field of activity was history
34                               UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
several semantic fields, e.g. kinship terms, body parts, clothing, domesticated and
non-domesticated animals as well as natural and religious phenomena, personal
pronouns, and numerals. The list further contains directions, adjectives, colour terms,
and verbs of every class. Polo adds footnotes that either explain in greater detail a
particular word or point to the Aymara or Quechua origin of the item. The author also
provides a list of fourteen Spanish loan words (p. 478) and about 30 phrases (p. 478-
479), which he considered to be of frequent use. They include the questions for food,
one's name, and one's well-being. Polo concludes his article with some brief remarks
on his spelling of Uchumataqu lexemes and some basic grammatical observations on
compounding, personal pronouns, numerals, adjectives, the negation ana, and kinship
terms. He also provides basic notes about the verbal tense system, adverbs, and the
agglutinative character of Uchumataqu (pp. 479-482).
      It is noteworthy that Polo does not use a particular phonological transcription
system but represents the Uchumataqu items by using the Spanish alphabet. The only
adaptation is that [kk], [pp], and [tt] are employed to ""reinforce the sound and also
distinguish certain words""70 (Polo 1901:480, translation mine).
      Polo remains vague about the circumstances under which he collected his data.
He mentions a small vocabulary by Augusto Benavides (Polo 1901:464), which he
used to compare it to his own data. Polo ascribes differences to either dialectal
variation or to a certain ""confusion on the Urus' part for being questioned in
Aymara""71 (Polo 1901:464, translation mine). It remains uncertain whether Polo
refers to Benavides' language consultants, who were confused for being questioned
in Aymara, or his own. In case he refers to his language consultants, it is still
unknown whether Polo spoke Aymara sufficiently to communicate directly with the
Uchumataqu speakers or whether he relied on an interpreter. Further, Polo does not
specify who his language consultants were, but since he uses a plural form when
refering to them he must have worked with at least two speakers. Polo was
accompanied by Javier Gonzalez del Valle, a professor at the Colegio National in
Puno, and Enrique Gamero, likewise a resident of Puno. The latter contributed to
Polo's article by collecting data in the villages of Ancoaqui and Ahuallamaya (Polo
 1901:463). Polo (ibid.) also expresses his thanks to Victor R. Cavinos, who left him
some words and phrases of Uchumataqu. Since both Gamero as well as Cavinos are
Spanish surnames, it is unlikely that they were native speakers of Uchumataqu and
therefore Polo's article does not only comprise his own data but also those of other
researchers, which, however, is not indicated in the word list itself. Thus, it remains
entirely unknown whom Polo worked with, whether he had an interpreter, and which
of the data result from his own field-work and which do not.
     However, Polo (1901:463) mentions that he visited the Lake Titicaca region in
February 1897 to collect his data, which then were published four years later. He
does not further specify the duration of this trip but since Polo (1901:463) refers to it
as ""una ràpida excursion"", it must have been a rather short time. For all we know this
was Polo's only visit to the Uru, at least for linguistic purposes. We do not know of
     ""Las letras kk, pp, /ƒ, son para reforzar el somdo, y distinguir asi algunas palabras "" (italics by author)
     ""[...] pueden provenir de equivocación de los indios al ser preguntados en aimarâ ""
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                             35
which kind Polo's relationship to his language consultants was, but it is remarkable
that he characterises the Uru as remaining in their ""primitive state"" and points out
that the Spanish conquerers could oppress them only by work and taxes (Polo
1901:459, 460). This description shows that Polo was not only influenced by the
picture of the Uru as presented in historical sources but also by the general idea of his
time that there is a constant progression from primitive to less primitive to civilised
human communities72 (cf. Dager Alva 2000:138).
     For an evaluation of Polo's data, we have to take into consideration that Polo's
language consultants and their personal backgrounds remain unknown as does the
exact duration of Polo's apparently brief stay with the Uchumataqu speakers.
Furthermore, we do not know whether Polo needed an interpreter. Finally, his article
contains data other than his own, but it is not indicated which these are. However, the
lexical material presented by Polo is mainly congruent with that of other researchers,
although similarities are sometimes difficult to establish due to Polo's uncommon
spelling. The phrases, clauses, and verbal paradigms hardly ever agree with those of
other sources. It happens frequently that Polo reports a feature which other sources
do not mention or else a particular feature is similar in all sources except for Polo.
That is, Polo's phrases, clauses, and paradigms can be hardly verified and thus, his
grammatical material is only in part reliable.","[50, 51, 52]"
"Ì .4.2.5.1 Vellard 1949
In the publication from 1949 Contribution à l'étude des indiens Uni ou Kot'suns
Vellard mentions his two most important language consultants: Manuel Inta and
Carlos Kispe. Vellard (1949:149) describes Manuel Inta as being about 90 years old,
estimated by the events of his youth Manuel Inta can recall. Despite his old age,
Manuel Inta was in good physical and mental health. According to Vellard, he spoke
a bit of Aymara but had no knowledge of either Quechua or Spanish. Vellard
describes him as an ""[excellent informateur"", and indeed most of the data presented
in the following were contributed by Manuel Inta. Carlos Kispe was considerably
younger than Manuel Inta, aged between 40 and 50 years and spoke neither Quechua
nor Spanish. However, Carlos Kispe was fluent in Aymara, which is due to his
intense contact with the surrounding Aymara population. In comparison to Manuel
Inta, Vellard describes Carlos Kispe's command of Uchumataqu as follows: ""[...] his
syntax is less pure and less varied than that of Manuel Inta and his lexicon is poorer
and mixed with Aymara.""'03 (Vellard 1949:149, translation mine). Apart from them,
Vellard (1949:150) also worked with other inhabitants of Irohito for general purposes
or for comparing vocabulary, but does not further specify who they were. However,
Vellard (1949:193-197) lists the names and age of the remaining inhabitants of
Irohito; for a discussion, cf. 1.3.4.
     Although Vellard provides sufficient information on his language consultants,
he does not state whether he required an interpreter in communicating with the Uni.
Since neither Manuel Inta nor Carlos Kispe spoke Spanish, it is likely that Vellard
was accompanied by an interpreter unless he had a good working command of
Aymara. From certain statements in the texts it can be inferred Vellard had a rather
close and even personal relationship with his language consultants. It was definitely
closer than that any of the preceding researchers had established.
     Vellard (1949:150) mentions that the texts described in the following were
revised together with the language consultants several times and the translation was
always checked in Aymara. He also comments repeatedly on differences perceptible
between Manuel Inta and Carlos Kispe and points to a certain linguistic variation
perceived with the latter (Vellard 1949:147, 148, 150). This variation is probably due
to Carlos Kispe's intensive contact with the Aymara communities. Vellard notes that
at the time he was in Irohito the language used among the inhabitants was only
Uchumataqu except for some individuals, who spoke Aymara to varying degrees.
However, most of the men and all of the women did not speak Aymara. This
observation stands in contrast to Métraux's statement (1935:89, see above), which
Vellard (1949:148) explains by the fact that a researcher gets into contact more easily
103
    ""[ .] su syntaxe était moins pure et moins vanée que celle de Manuel Inta et son vocabulaire plus
pauvre et plus mélangé d'aymara""

with those inhabitants who speak a second and more common language, such as
Aymara. This would give a false impression of the language community as a whole.
Vellard's aim was to collect as many ethnographic and linguistic data as possible
since he saw the Irohito community in immediate danger to perish (Vellard
1949:146).
     It is unknown during which of his visits Vellard collected the material presented
below. The article of 1949 is published in French and consists of an introduction with
some general notes on the flora and fauna of Lake Titicaca. It also contains a
description of the great draught during the 1940's, which caused the decay of the
Irohito community. Vellard also mentions the dates of his visits to Irohito (cf. tab.
1.3) in the introduction. In a section called ""Récits et Conversations"" Vellard
(1949:147-150) supplies information on the linguistic situation and explains how he
obtained and treated his data104. It also includes the introduction of Manuel Inta and
Carlos Kispe. Finally, Vellard provides some basic notes on the phonological
transcription used (cf. chapter 2).
   The most important part of the article for the current work is a sample of texts, as
presented in table 1.3. Each of these texts has an interlinear, word-by-word
translation. The sample of texts is followed by a free translation in French and brief
comments by Vellard concerning ethnographic information, the context for each text
recorded as well as some basic grammatical observations (Vellard 1949:170-188).

classified them as being ""purely Uru"", of mixed or Aymara origin (Vellard 1949:191-
197). The final section contains observations concerning physical anthropology and
includes detailed tables of Vellard's findings (Vellard 1949:197-209). The entire
article contains photos of the inhabitants of Irohito and their community.
      Vellard's sample of texts has to be regarded as unique among the material on
Uchumataqu since he is the only researcher ever to have collected entire texts.
Furthermore, some of these texts are of considerable length and they deal with
different aspects of life. From a methodological point of view, Vellard's study is the
only that conforms to most modem scientific standards by e.g. revising the data with
his language consultants and providing background information. However, as Vellard
already points out Carlos Kispe was influenced to a certain degree by Aymara, which
is reflected in his data e.g. by the use of affirmative marker -pini. It is a loan from
Aymara, which occurs only the data collected by Vellard (with one exception found
in Métraux). Other such loans are e.g. wali 'much, many' (DeLucca 1983:444),
which likewise appears frequently in Vellard's material. That is, we find more
influences from Aymara in Vellard's texts than in earlier documents. However, when
compared to material from preceding studies (e.g. Uhle, Métraux) we find a high
degree of congruency and most of the interpretations obtained by an analysis of
Vellard's texts can be verified by comparisons with other material.","[61, 62, 63]"

2.13.2 Stress
Main word stress in morphologically simple forms lies on the penultimate syllable, as
already observed by Uhle (1894:2). Stress is indicated by an acute <'>, as in:
(212)          pa.ya                  'adobe brick'                      (Lehmann 1929b: 1)
               hi.pu                  'wind'                             (Vellard 1949:162)
               cé.ra                  'hair'                             (Uhle 1894:64.2)
               ά.ca                   'head'                             (Vellard 1950:57)
Even in the case of inflection, stress remains on the penultimate syllable, as
demonstrated in example (213), in which stressed elements are marked bold.

               'The mother goes far away before she runs dry, for [the child] not
               remembering the breast [= being breastfed], for forgetting it.'264
Although in example (213) stress mostly falls on the penultimate syllable, there are
irregularities since e.g. kata-srap'a is doubly stressed. In what follows, I will present
changes that take place when morphologically simple forms undergo affixation. It is
important to point out that the data do not provide rules governing the distribution but
rather tendencies and that there are counterexamples to the claims presented below.
This is probably due to obsolescene phenomena in the process of language extinction.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that stress is not always marked
consistently. Within a single source, some words may be marked for stress while
others not. Polo (1901) and Métraux (1935) do not indicate stress at all. I will discuss
nominal265 stress first before turning to verbal stress patterns.
     Nominal stems can consist of one, two, or three syllables and when the stem
undergoes affixation, the following stress patterns are possible: a word receives
multiple stress, stress remains in its original position, or it is shifted to the
penultimate syllable. The choice of which process takes place depends on the number
of syllables in the nominal stem and in the morpheme attached.
     A monosyllabic nominal stem receives double stress only if the attached
morpheme consists of two syllables, thus resulting in a trisyllabic word. This is
particularly true for suffixes that are not easily affected by elision, such as
terminative -kama or comitative -(s)tani.

    The clilic of first person -/ cannot be explained. I understand the construction kö -na kù ki to consist of
kona tuh 'before dry', ι e of two separate words. For further analysis of this sentence, cf. 4.1.2.3.

To shift stress to the penultimate syllable is a possible alternative to applying
multiple stress. When a monosyllabic word receives a bisyllabic suffix, stress shifts
to the new penultimate syllable. The circumstances are the same as for receiving
double stress, and the criteria for the choice between double stress and stress shift
have remained unclear.

In monosyllabic nominal stems, stress remains in its original position when a
monosyllabic morpheme is attached. The same holds when a poly-syllabic morpheme
undergoes elision and is thus perceived as monosyllabic. In these cases, the position
occupied by stress is often not the penultimate syllable.

With bisyllabic nominal stems no clear pattern of distribution emerges. That is, the
number of syllables in the attached morpheme does not seem to have any impact on
the position of stress. Bisyllabic nominal stems do not receive multiple stress but
otherwise, stress either shifts to the new penultimate syllable or remains in its
original position. Example (217) demonstrates instances where stress remains in the
original position (i.e. on the formerly penultimate syllable).assume that assimilation of/x/ and /s/ took place and that the latter assimilated to /x/.

    fcsfadenves from separative -kistana but due to elision, the formerly trisyllabic morpheme is reduced to
the monosyllabic form of -ksta.

             'you have a younger brother'
Most trisyllabic nominal stems already bear double stress, mainly in an alternating
pattern with the first syllable stressed269. Attaching further morphemes does not
change the stress pattern of trisyllabic forms, particularly in the case of monosyllabic
morphemes. Example (219) shows items where the stress pattern does not change.

Example (220) in particular may suggest that there are hardly any rules that govern
the distribution of stress. Although tukima is a single stressed, trisyllabic nominal
stem taking a bisyllabic morpheme, the stress pattern remains unaltered although the
expectation is that it receives double stress.","[133, 134, 135, 136]"

    As will be shown in subsequent sections and chapters, adverbs stand between nouns and adjectives

3.6.2 Adjectives
Adjectives in Uchumataqu form an open, separate class of words. The most common
function of adjectives is to serve as modifiers of nouns, as demonstrated in (89).
(89)      cuni soni-naka
          good man-PL
          'good men'                                      (Uhle 1894:28.2)321
Since adjectives function as modifiers of head nouns (as in 89), they themselves do
not occur as heads of phrases except for some attributive predicate clauses (cf.
chapter 7), as in (90).
(90)        utca-kasi-cay

Thus, their restricted ability to appear as heads of phrases sets them apart from nouns,
whose normal function is to act as heads of noun phrases.
    On the structural level, adjectives differ from both nouns and verbs in that they
do not take nominal or verbal markers with some exceptions. There are two or three
elements322 that describe concepts that could be encoded as adjectives but which in
Uchumataqu are expressed as verbs. Please consider examples (91) and (92).
(91)        oc-u-cay
            tired-ISG-DEC
            'I am tired (lit: 'I do tire.')'                        (Uhle 1894:89.1)323

            'I am ill (lit.: My being ill.)'324                     (Métraux 1935:100)
Apart from the presumably verbal use of some otherwise adjectivally encoded
concepts, another exception occurs with predicator -kasi. As will be further outlined
below, this element is usually restricted to predicative adjectives but there are six
cases where it occurs on nouns. However, some of these are doubtful and in others,
predicator -kasi seems to be used to further stress the fact that one is dealing with a
nominal predicate clause (cf. 93). If this interpretation is correct, the use of -kasi in
nominal predicate clauses may be considered hypercorrect.

    Uhle does not specify whether this phrase comes from Uchumataqu or Chipaya. However, evidence for
the verbal use of oc- 'to be tired' in Uchumataqu comes from Métraux (1935).

    This example is sinking The pronominal form is possessive, meaning 'my', whereas the following
form appears to be verbal due to the use of first person singular marking -u. I have no explanation for this
154                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
However, apart from this rare and somewhat doubtful overlap, adjectives do not
share morphology with neither nouns nor verbs. Instead, they take predicator -kasi,
which is used to predicate adjectives (see 90 and 94).

           'I am well.'                                   (Vellard 1967:23)
Predicator -kasi does not occur on either verbs or nouns, except for the anomalies
mentioned above and thus, it is a morpheme restricted to adjectives alone.
      However, although there are some overlaps with nouns and verbs, the functional
and structural properties of adjectives set them apart from both these categories and
sufficiently classify them as a word class of their own. For a more detailed discussion
of the basis on which adjectives are classified as a separate class of words, cf. 4.3.
      The category of adjectives comprises four subcategories, which to varying
degrees share features with the class of adjectives. However, none of these
subcategories can be termed prototypically adjectival. Each of them will be discussed
below.
      The first subcategory consists of adjectival states derived from verbs by
application of -tni or its allomorph -tin, which itself results from a combination of
resultative -/ and subject relativiser -ni (cf. 5.2.1, 5.6.1). Adjectival states like
prototypical adjectives do not take nominal or verbal morphology and even when
they appear in predicative function they are not inflected with the adjectival
predicator -kasi325 (95).

          totora raised
          'The torora reeds are raised (in bundles).'              (Vellard 1949:164)
Therefore, from a structural point of view, adjectival states differ from prototypical
adjectives. However, with respect to functional properties we find that -tni I -tin
marked States behave very much like adjectives, i.e. their most important function is
to modify nouns (cf. 96 and 97). It is necessary to point out that the majority of
expressions containing -tni I -tin is lexicalised and it is thus impossible to trace the
underlying verb form (96).

That is, the link between adjectives and adjectival states is their common function to
act as modifiers of nouns. A point not discussed here is their meaning, which further  Except for one case which I regard as exceptional

suggests to classify -tni I -tin marked items as adjectives. For a more detailed
discussion on adjectival states, cf. 4.3.5.
      The second subcategory consists of adverbs that express manner and verbal
degree or modify other adjectives or adverbs (cf. 6.1.3 to 6.1.5). With regard to
structural properties, we find that these adverbs behave like prototypical adjectives in
that they are inflected with predicator -kasi when used predicatively (98)326.

In contrast to adverbs expressing time, location, and direction (cf. 3.6.1), adverbs that
signify degree and modification do not take nominal marking. With respect to their
functional properties, it is possible to state that their main function lies in modifying
verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, as demonstrated in examples (99) and (100).
(99)        qhi:pi   oqlay-a

            'Go quickly! '                                            (Uhle 1894:98.1 )

Although these adverbs do not modify nouns (as do prototypical adjectives) but other
parts of speech, from a structural as well as functional point of view they are close to
prototypical adjectives. Therefore they can be considered to be a subcategory of
adjectives. Thus, adverbs stand between nouns and adjectives with adverbs of time,
direction, and location being encoded nominally (see above), while adverbs of
manner, degree, and modification behave like adjectives.
     The third subcategory is built by quantifying adjectives of which there are only
two instances: yuki 'much, many' and sapa 'every' (cf. 4.3.4; for yuki, see also
6.1.4). With respect to their structural properties they behave similarly to adjectival
states, i.e. they do not take any morphological marking.
(101)          yuk[i] qa:
               much money
               'much money; a lot of money'                              (Uhle 1894:29)

               'Blood comes every moon = menstruation.' (Vellard 1950:59)
As shown in (101) and (102) both yuki and sapa function as modifiers of nouns,
which is their functional link to prototypical adjectives. That is, although none of

them is inflected with morphological markers, they are related to adjectives by their
function as nominal modifiers.
     The last category to be discussed are numerals. Structurally they differ from
adjectives as presented above because numerals are obligatorily inflected with
nominal possessive marking -ci, thus being structurally closer to nouns than to
adjectives.

            'thirty-three'                                (Vellard 1951:18)
However, apart from the lexicalised expressions of pikiltan I puhultan 'the two
together' and cepultan 'the three together' (Métraux 1935:95, 108) no other nominal
markers appear on numerals. So far, no instance is found where numerals appear as
heads of phrases. From a functional point of view, they resemble adjectives since
their main purpose is to act as modifiers of nouns, as shown in (104).
(104)       wir-i-l      pis    xala-kfij   kun-u-cay
            I-LV-CL=1    two     lama-TOPkill-PSTl-DEC
            'I killed two lamas.'                              (Vellard 1967:15)
Thus, the situation of numerals is similar to that of adjectival states marked by -tni I
-tin since numerals differ structurally from adjectives but resemble them very much
with respect to function. On the basis of this consideration, I subsume numerals under
the general category of adjectives.
      As the discussion of subcategories has shown, the class of adjectives is even less
homogenous than that of nouns. Particularly with respect to manner, degree, and
modifying adverbs as well as numerals we find overlaps with the class of nouns.
However, this overlap is a minor one. In most cases, adverbs can be assigned rather
clearly to either the category of nouns or adjectives, while numerals are restricted to
one single nominal morpheme, possessive -ci, and do not take other nominal
marking. What sets these subcategories further apart from nouns is that their main
function is modification of other parts of speech but not to act as heads of phrases.
These features show that the subcategories are not prototypical adjectives but stand
between these and nouns, although to differing degrees they are closer to adjectives,
and are thus treated as adjectival rather than nominal categories here.","[169, 170, 171, 172, 173]"
"1.1.2 Uchumataqu compared with Chipaya
Chipaya is the only member of the Uru-Chipaya4 linguistic family that is still in use
today. It has approximately 1,800 native speakers in the communitiy Santa Ana de
Chipaya near Lake Coipasa in southwest Bolivia. Chipaya is highly endangered due
to an increasing influence of Spanish in modem Bolivian society and a shift to
Aymara. Uchumataqu and Chipaya are considered to be as closely related as French
4
   In 2001 the Nacwn Originaria Um (NOU) was formed in Oraro and consists of several groups, who
consider themselves to be of Uru origin. However, none of them speaks a Uru-Chipaya language any
more, with the exception of the Chipaya.
6                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
and Spanish (Muysken 2001:77), although the exact kind and degree of their
relationship still has to be explored.
      It has become common usage to refer to the variety of the Titicaca region as
Uru, whereas Chipaya denotes the variety spoken in southwest Bolivia close to Lake
Coipasa. For further discussion of the denominations Uru and Uchumataqu, cf. 1.3.1.
      Both varieties are structurally close to each other and with respect to phonology,
we may say that Uchumataqu and Chipaya are almost identical (at least from what
can be judged from the phonological information on Uchumataqu given in the
sources). However, with regard to morphology, Uchumataqu has certain morphemes
that do not occur in Chipaya, either because Uchumataqu preserved an older stage of
the language due to its isolation or, alternatively, Uchumataqu developed these
morphemes after its split from other Uru-Chipaya. These morphemes, then, are
unique to Uchumataqu. Among these unique morphemes are possibly the personal
pronoun of second person singular kun 'you', which appears to be restricted to
interrogative clauses. Another pronominal form is -wici, which can be described as
an original pronominal plural marker that was used to build niwici 'they' before
Aymara plural marker -naka took on this function. Morphemes that probably
developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya speaking groups had lost contact are
predicator -kasi, question bound topic marker -xwi, and In-Group marker -acu. The
non-existence of predicator -kasi in Chipaya relates to another difference: in
Uchumataqu, predicator -kasi distinguishes adjectives as a separate word class, while
in Chipaya adjectives form a subcategory of nouns (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:103) but
do not constitute a class of its own5. Uchumataqu resultative -/ resembles Aymara
resultative marker -ta to some degree and Chipaya seems to have borrowed the
Aymara marker. Thus, Uchumataqu -/ and Chipaya -ta are not entirely different but
contrast, just like Uchumataqu -t and the Aymara morpheme. It is possible that
Uchumataqu -t derives from the Aymara form and would be therefore a morpheme
that developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya had become separated.
      One of the more crucial differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is the
locative marking system. As will be further outlined under 4.1.1.2 and 4.1.1.3,
Uchumataqu has two basic locative forms, which are -kis and -fa/, each of which has
an allomorph derived by metathesis: -kis I -ski and -fa/' / -sikf. The form -kis I -ski is
the directional locative, which marks a movement 'into X' with motion verbs, while
with stative or position verbs it is translated as 'in X'. The form -fa/' / -siki expresses
a locative and is always understood as 'in X'. I analyse this as a system in transition
(cf. 4.1.1). Chipaya also has two locative markers -kiz(i) and -kin(a), which do not
possess metathesised allomorphs. The form -kiz(i) refers to entities or objects being
close to the speaker, while -kin(a) marks entities or objects being away from the
!
   Chipaya preserves lexicalisations with -Un, a form that in Uchumataqu serves to create adjectival states,
which form a subcategory of adjectives In Uchumataqu, -/in was still productive at the time of
documentation, but lexicahsed forms with -Im exist too (for further discussion, cf 4 3 5) In Chipaya, it is
doubtful whether the form -tin is still productive Cerrón-Palomino (2006) does not interpret it as a
morpheme
   It has to be noted that the interpretation of-ski and -siki as allomorphs is arguable It may possible that
both forms represent one morpheme and -ski is the same as -siki only with an unstressed -si
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                                7
speaker (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:128). Uchumataqu, too, uses a form -kina but it is
purely directional. Thus, the two systems are rather different. When I asked a native
speaker of Chipaya to translate the Uchumataqu expression wat-siki 'in the village'
(Uhle 1894:19), he understood it as 'the weave (el tejido)', thus analysing wat- as the
verb stem 'to weave', -s possibly as the action nominaliser followed by a linking
vowel -/', and topic marker -kf.
      Another case of formally similar but functionally different suffixes are Chipaya
-z and Uchumataqu -s. Chipaya -z is analysed by Cerrón-Palomino (2006:159, 160)
as 'reflexivo-mediopasivo', while for Uchumataqu -s I propose an interpretation as
first person singular subject marker. Even if possible interpretation errors are left
aside, the fact remains that both suffixes appear in the same slot, are preceded and
followed by the same types of morphemes, and they even have similar allomorphs,
namely -zh in Chipaya and -s in Uchumataqu. Nonetheless, they cannot express the
same idea since Chipaya -z is not restricted to a particular person, whereas
Uchumataqu -s marks a first person singular as subject. Thus, formally they are
almost identical but differ considerably with respect to function.
      One of the greatest differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is that the
latter has a gender distinction, which Uchumataqu entirely lacks. The Chipaya gender
distinction affects nouns, pronouns, and the personal clitics, although there is a
growing tendency to neglect the use of female pronouns, particularly with respect to
the plural form nanaka 'they (fern.)'. This may be due to a growing Spanish
influence on Chipaya, since in Spanish a group of men and women is referred to as
ellos 'they (masc.)'. Only if there is a group composed solely of women would the
female form ellas 'they (fern.)' be used. A similar use of ninaka 'they (masc.)' and
nanaka 'they (fern.)' can be observed in Chipaya8.
      It is possible that some of the morphemes described as characteristic only for
Chipaya existed in Uchumataqu before it became highly endangered. Alternatively, it
is possible that they existed even at the time of documentation, but went unnoticed
because documentation would have required a long-term study of a wider range of
data including conversations between native speakers, story telling, etc. However,
given the high number of different morphemes or formally similar but functionally
different affixes, it seems doubtful that intelligibility between speakers of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya has ever been very high, despite Wachtel's observation
(1990:269) that during a recent meeting of Uchumataqu and Chipaya speakers both
groups could talk to each in ""Uru-Chipaya"". During field-work carried out in January
2006, I asked several native speakers of Chipaya to translate phrases and simple
clauses from Uchumataqu and the outcome was very different. In some cases, there
was hardly any or no understanding at all, while in other cases there was a certain
degree of intelligibility. However, the fact that some Uchumataqu phrases from Uhle
   The interpretation and transcription of these morphemes in Chipaya provided by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006) is slightly different: what I termed action nominaliser -s is labelled the ""infinitivizador"" -z(a)
(Cerrón-Palomino 2006 131), while what I analyse as a linking vowel -ι is termed by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006.87) as ""inflexion vocalica"" The interpretation of-Ai as topic marker is the same for Uchumataqu (cf.
7 2 2) and Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino 2006 175).

intelligibility since a French native speaker would probably understand the basic

be probably quite different if (s)he were confronted with rapid, spoken Spanish. This
was actually the case when during field-work I asked the Chipaya native speakers to
listen to the Uchumataqu passages in Vellard's film: none of them could immediately
understand what has been said and it was only after several sessions that they had
gained a general idea of the Uchumataqu texts. That is, it has probably been possible
for an Uchumataqu native speaker to understand whether a Chipaya speaker talked
about his / her family, fanning, or the latest transactions made in La Paz, but details
may remain obscure.","[22, 23, 24, 25]"

Sometimes the subject is expressed overtly but the tendency is for the predicate to

precede or follow the predicate; no preference for either position can be established.

A significant feature of existential predicate clauses (cf. Payne 1997:112) is the
obligatory use of the copulative verb sel- 'to be' which always carries declarative -
cay, while the predicate either takes topic marker -ki (59) or is not marked at all (60),
although this happens only exceptionally.

Locational predicate clauses predicate over the location of an entity. Thus, the
morphological feature of this predication type is the application of nominal locative
marking morphology, such as directional locative -kis, locative -fcy/ (62), and
postpositions which follow the subject (63). Although the locational predicate can
take declarative -cay, this happens only exceptionally (63).","[298, 299]"
"5.8 Mood and modality
The terms mood and modality have been extensively discussed in the literature and
the resulting definitions reflect the various approaches to this topic. A detailed
discussion of the terms is beyond the scope of this section and in what follows, I rely
on Foley and Van Valin (1984) as cited in Bybee (1985).
     Mood is understood by Bybee as 'a marker on the verb that signals how the
speaker chooses to put the proposition into the discourse context.' (1985:165), i.e. the
speaker makes a statement on his / her view of the predication. According to this
definition, mood is subdivided by Bybee into ""illocutionary force"" and ""commitment
to the truth of the assertion"" (1985:170), the first subgroup consisting of imperative,
Optative, Admonitive, Prohibitive, and Interrogative, the latter of Subjunctive,
Dubitative, Probable, Potential, and Conditional. If this definition is applied to
53
    maska 'pot' is a loan from Quechua
536
    putti- is a loan from Spanish puedo 'I can'. The ending -u is interpreted as Uchumataqu first person
singular.
537
    In one example the adjective kewa 'fat' is used as a verb, in the sense of 'to get fat'
240                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Uchumataqu and the inflection with declarative marker -cay is chosen as a criterion
(cf. Bybee 1985:170), the following scheme evolves:Speech act type 538                                     Inflection with declarative -cay
Interrogative, imperative, optative =
                                                                                —
 Illocutionary force
Potential, conditional, future irrealis539 =                                     +
 Speaker's commitment
Table 5.4: Mood, speech act type, and inflection with declarative -cayWe find that those speech act types labelled by Bybee as ""illocutionary force"" (ibid.)
cannot take declarative -cay, whereas those which express the speaker's commitment
can take the marker as can any basic declarative clause. Thus, the proposition made
by Bybee (on the basis of Foley and Van Valin 1984) is valid for Uchumataqu, too,
and accordingly, the speech act types treated in the following sections (imperative,
Optative, Potential, Conditional, and the so-called future irrealis) are viewed as mood
categories.
     A term not yet mentioned is deontic and Foley and Van Valin (1984:214) and
Bybee (1985:166) agree on that it belongs to the category of modality but not to
mood since deontic modalities always refer to the agent of the predication and not to
the speaker. Thus, the categories of mood and modality in Uchumataqu can be
sketched as follows:
                /\                                              ι

"4.4 The numeral system
The Uchumataqu numeral system is a decimal one, as is shown in the way of
building numbers higher than ten. Numbers up to 99 are built on the base of qhalo
'ten'. In Uchumataqu we find the following numerals:
208                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
(160)         ci              'Γ         taqcuku            '6'
              piski           '2'        tu.ku              '7'

              paxpiki         '4'        sanqu              '9'

Cardinal numbers higher than ten are built as possessor-possessed constructions
where possessive -ci marks possession on the possessed (cf. 4.1.2.1).
     The numbers 11-19 are built with qhalo as possessor with the digit in the
function of the possessed. Here we find the following order: ten-digit-POS(-POS).
(161)         kalu    paxk'pik'i-ci-ci
              ten    four-POS-POS
              'fourteen'                                             (Vellard 1951:18)
For the numbers 20-99 the reverse order holds: digit-ten as in (162), or digit-ten-
digit-posas in (163).
(162)         cep      kalo
              three ten
              'thirty'                                               (Vellard 1951:18)
(163)         cep     kalo pisk 'i-ci-ci
              three ten two-pos-pos
              'thirty-two'                                           (Vellard 1951:18)
Possessive -ci is attached only to digits, ie: 11-19, 21-29, etc 452 . Constructions as
(163) can be understood as a possessive structure with the digit being possessed and
inflected with -ci. However, possessive -ci is not attached to 20, 30, 40, etc (example
162). These are built in the way of digit-ten without taking possessive -ci.
      Cardinal numbers 200 to 900 are built in the way of: digit-hundred, without
possessive -ci (164). One hundred itself is expressed as qhalo qhalo (lit: 'ten ten') or
with the Aymara ioanpataka.
(164)         konko pataka
              eight hundred
              'eight hundred'                                        (Vellard 1951:19)
Numbers from 101 to 199 etc. are built in the following way: hundred-digit(-ten)(-
POS).(165)         pataka        pisk'i-ci-ci
              onehundred two-POS-POS
              'one hundred and two'                                  (Vellard 1951:18)451
    The forms given by Muysken are chhip and chhepe, respectively, but they will not be used in the
following since Uchumataqu does not have an aspirated palatal voiceless affricate *[chh], as outlined in
chapter 2. Furthermore, the sources agree on that the form for the numeral 'three' is cep, which will be
employed instead.
452
    In Muysken (2005) the use of possessive -ci on numerals is not demonstrated any more The loss of this
morpheme is probably due to language death
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOMINAL SYSTEM                                                                             209

As with cardinal numbers 11 to 99 possessive -ci is attached only to digits but not to
ten (166). The numeral 1000 is expressed as waranka, which is a loan from Quechua
or Aymara. For numbers above 900 we have only fragmentary data and this topic will
therefore not be treated here. Numerals as quantifiers of nouns appear in the modifier
position preceding the head noun.

Multiplication is expressed by Aymara wasa 'time(s)' (cf. Middendorf [1891]
1955:70).
(168)          cep      wasa
               three times
               ' three times '                                           (Métraux 1935:97)
According to Uhle (1894:32.1) an ordinal relationship is expressed by cardinal
numbers, too. Thus, an utterance like cep quya (Uhle 1894:32.1) can be translated as
either 'three houses' or 'the third house'.
     With regard to morphological markers we find only three forms that are attached
to numerals. These are declarative -cay, Topic marker -ki, and possessive -ci. Plural
marker -naka and numerals do not appear together since plurality is expressed by the
numeral itself (cf. 4.1.4).454
     There are two lexicalised exceptions where a numeral is combined with case
marking comitative -stani. These arepikiltani Ipukultani 'the two' and cepultani 'the
three'(cf. 4. 1.3).
(169)          amcuk cepultani
               you the three
               'the three of you (pi)'                                   (Uhle 1894:25)455
The numeral ci 'one' is related to the Demonstrative pronouns ci 'that' and ti
'this'456, (cf. 4.2.3).453
     palaki is probably a loan from aymara pataca '[c]ien, ciento, centena' (DeLucca 1983 335)
'l54 Three instances are found where the predicator -kasi is attached to Spanish uno 'one', but no instance
where the predicator is attached to an Uchumataqu numeral. The use of -kasi on a numeral is not
considered a regular application but an uncommon device However, Uchumataqu numerals behave similar
to adjectives in that they do not take nominal suffixes (others than -ci) but, on the other hand, are separated
from adjectives because they do not accept predicator -kasi but instead must be marked with possessive ci
Therefore, numerals in Uchumataqu stand somewhere between nouns and adjectives

'l56 This distinction is not necessarily found in every manuscript According to the author's transcription,
we find ή and », tsi and n, and sometimes only U However, the evidence supports the view that
Uchumataqu has these two different demonstrative pronouns They do not take case suffixes although Uhle

The word for 'another', cila, is probably related to the numeral ci 'one'. The element
-la has to be considered as lexicalised.
(1894:26.2) mentions a plural tsi-naka 'some'. This is the only instance of nominal inflection on a
demonstrative pronoun
5 THE VERBAL SYSTEM
In contrast to nouns, verbs do not express time stable concepts but denote actions,
processes, and events. Uchumataqu marks tense, aspect, mood, and grammatical
functions on the verb. According to their semantic content, several kinds of verb
classes can be proposed, such as e.g. motion or action verbs.This may have
consequences for affixation possibilities. Another subcategory in forms according to
which Uchumataqu verbs may be ordered is the distinction between active and stative
verbs. The verb sel- 'to be' functions as a copulative verb.","[224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"
"1.4.2.4 Alfred Métraux (1902-1963)
The Swiss scholar Alfred Métraux was bom in Lausanne on November 5' 1902 and
in 1922 began his studies at the École des Chartes, the Sorbonne, and the École
Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris97 (Sachot 2007:61). In 1928 Métraux went to
Argentina, where he founded the Ethnological Institute at the University of Tucumân,
of which he was director for the following six years (d'Ans 1978:19f; Monnier
2003:9-14; Wagley 1964:603f; quoted in: Sachot 2007:61). He went on field-work
trips to the Chaco region. Northwest Argentina, and the Bolivian Altipiano. The data
on Uchumataqu (as well as on Chipaya) were collected during these years98. Alfred
Métraux committed suicide in Paris on April 11th 1963 (Sachot 2007:63).
      As other researchers of the late 19th and first half of the 20lh century, Métraux is
not very detailed about the background information of his field-work. That is, there is
no comment on whether Métraux employed an interpreter or which languages were
used in the process of data collection. However, as Sachot (2007:64) points out
Métraux was accompanied by an Aymara speaking interpreter when visiting the
community of Chipaya and we may therefore assume that he also had an interpreter
with him when studying Uchumataqu. It is also likely that the languages used during
the interviews were Spanish, Aymara, and Uchumataqu. It remains likewise unkown
with whom Métraux collected his data and the only note made about one of his
language consultants refers to ""[u]n vieil Indien"" (Métraux 1935:88). We know that
he must have worked with more than one person since Métraux mentions his
""informateurs uro"" (Métraux 1935:89). It can be inferred from his data that Métraux
worked with elderly people who were fully competent native speakers of
Uchumataqu. Although Métraux does not further specify the kind of relationship
between him and his language consultants, he mentions an unhappy incident that took
place during his stay. The two Bolivian soldiers, who accompanied Métraux to
Ancoaqui, became annoyed with some inhabitants of the village and threatened to
bum their houses (Métraux 1935:89). It is likely that this incident did not improve
matters for Métraux.
     Together with Posnansky, Métraux stayed in Ancoaqui for one week in June
1931 (Métraux 1935:75). It remained Métraux's only visit to the community. The
resulting article Contribution à l'ethnographie et à la linguistique des indiens Uro
d'Ancoaqui (Bolivie) was published in 1935, i.e. four years later. The language used
in the article is French.
     The article consists of an introduction with some notes on the literature
published so far on the Uchumataqu speakers and a brief report of the circumstances97
    Among his professors were well-known anthropologists of his time, as e g. Marcel Mauss and Paul
Rivet Métraux departed from university with a PhD degree, the topic of his work was the material culture
of the Tupi-Guarani.
98
    In the following years, Métraux became interested in areas outside South America and between 1948
and 1950, he carried out ethnographical research in Haiti (d'Ans 1978 21; quoted in: Sachot 2007:621) As
a result, Métraux published Le vaudou haïtien in 1958, which is one of his best known works, and for
which he became famous.
42                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
of Métraux's field trip (Métraux 1935:75, 76). The introduction is followed by a
detailed ethnographical description concerning the material culture: house types,
household goods, and tools as well as notes on the economic situation (hunting,
fishing, agriculture, livestock and cattle) (Métraux 1935:76-84). The following part
deals with the several uses of totora reeds, used for building rafts, plaits, and ropes
(Métraux 1935:84-86). A final section describes the clothing of the Uru (Métraux
1935:86f). On the next few pages Métraux (1935:87-89) is concerned with the social
and religious organisation of the Uru and also adds a brief section on their
""character"". The word list is preceded by some basic notes on the linguistic situation,
including a very brief comment on the phonological transcription system used (cf.
chapter 2). Métraux (1935:89) observes that the Uru would not use their ancient
language any more but spoke Aymara even among themselves. A somewhat
contradictory statement is that Métraux considered Uchumataqu to be ""purer""99 than
closely related Chipaya, which he explained by the fact that Ancoaqui and Irohito are
geographically close to important Uru centres of Lake Titicaca (ibid.). Métraux
supplies photos of Uchumataqu speakers and detailed drawings on tools and
household goods throughout his ethnographic description.
      The word list itself (Métraux 1935:90-110) is French-Uru and ordered
alphabetically. It contains 631 lexical items of all word classes, i.e. verbs from every
class, adjectives, adverbs of time, manner and degree as well as nouns. The latter
cover all possible semantic fields, as there are: body parts, kinship terms, clothing,
food, illness, tools and appliances, balsa rafts, domesticated and non-domesticated
animals as well as natural and astronomical phenomena. Métraux also provides
personal and interrogative pronouns, directional adverbs, short phrases of everyday
life, and numerals 1 to 23, 100, 1.000 and 10.000. However, Métraux made only very
basic grammatical observations, such as that e.g. -kin is a suffix meaning 'to, toward'
(Métraux 1935:109).
      Apart from a mere word list Métraux provides almost 200 additional explicative
clauses to the majority of his lexical data. These clauses and phrases aim to show the
use of a certain item in various contexts, e.g. in interrogative or imperative clauses.
Thus, we find eighteen clauses exemplifying the use of the verb 'to go'. Example
clauses occur with several kinds of lexemes, but particularly with the following
verbs: 'to have'100; 'to kill'; 'to hit, beat'; 'to come'; 'to put'; 'to see'; 'to make'; 'to
want'; 'to eat'; 'to leave'. The interrogative pronoun 'who?' is likewise explained in
greater detail. The example clauses are of varying length and complexity.
      Métraux's work is primarily a word list, which may be the reason why it has not
been considered for subsequent publications on Uchumataqu. That is, neither
LaBarre (1941), Palavecino (1949) nor Vellard (1949-67) mention it as a source of
their works and recent studies (e.g. Torero 2002) refer only to Uhle ( 1894), Lehmann
(1929), or Vellard but neglect Métraux's word list. Although Métraux's study on
Uchumataqu has always been underestimated, it contains highly valuable linguistic99
    Métraux does not explain what he means by ""purer"", but we may assume that it implies that
Uchumataqu was less influenced by Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish than Chipaya
100
    The notion of 'to have' is expressed by a construction involving benefactive -fail and the copulative
verb sel- 'to be'
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                                  43
(and ethnographic) information. As already mentioned above, his language
consultants must have been ftilly competent native speakers of Uchumataqu, to which
the complexity of several of the example clause points. Not only is the old
pronominal plural marker -wici present in Métraux's data, Métraux is, apart from
Uhle, the only researcher to report vocalisation (cf. 2.12.1.2). Almost all grammatical
interpretations obtained by an analysis of Métraux's example clauses are congruent
with Uhle's findings and can be verified by them. The lexical material provided by
Métraux agrees to a high proportion with the lexical data given by e.g. Lehmann
(1929b). It is a general observation that there is a gap between material recorded
before 1931 and material recorded after this time. This gap is found in the lexicon but
to a the larger degree it occurs with grammatical morphemes. That is, certain features
present in the documents from 1894 to 1935 are not found in Vellard's work, while
Vellard reports characteristics that seem to be of recent origin, since neither Uhle
(1894), Lehmann (1929), or Métraux (1935) mentions them.
      To conclude, I regard Métraux's material to be highly reliable and informative.
Together with Uhle's manuscript Métraux's data form 'core information' on
Uchumataqu. However, as other works of his time, Métraux's article shows the same
lack of information on his language consultants, languages used during the recording
process, and the general circumstances of his field-work. Furthermore, the time he
spent in Ancoaqui was rather short and he did not pay a second visit. From a present-
day point of view, this can be considered a significant failure in the process of data
collection.","[58, 59, 60]"
"5.1 Tense marking suffixes
Uchumataqu has a tense system which may be a future / non-future-system although
there are markers for present, past, and future tense. The markers for simple present
and past tense 1 resemble each other more than those for future and simple present
tense (cf. table 5.1). Furthermore, a verb in present457 and past tense can be zero
marked for tense, which is rare for future tense.
      It is only for future and simple present tense that a person distinction is made,
i.e. first person singular is marked differently from all other persons which receive
the same marking, habitual present tense, past tense 1 and 2 may be viewed as having
some aspectual notion to them, due to their lack of person marking (see also 5.2.2).
With regard to the distribution of pronominal and clitic elements, the tenses behave
similarly. The two strategies employed most often are either no marking at all or the
use of a subject or subject pronoun. If neither a subject or subject pronoun nor a
subject clitic is used, we must assume that context contributes to person reference.
However, the first person sg is always clearly marked and very often there is double
or triple marking. In this case, a subject clitic is attached to a subject pronoun, and in
present or future tense the verb takes -u or -a, respectively. In general, clitic elements
do not establish person reference by themselves. The tense markers are applied
disregarding verb class.458Person          Future tense Simple                 Habitual             Past tense I     Past tense II

   In simple present tense, this is the usual way to express any person other than first person singular
458
   Although future and present tense in Uchumataqu are nearly identical to Chipaya, the varieties differ to
some degree in past tense marking Uchumataqu does not have the Chipaya -ci paradigm, which does not
only express past tense but also person reference and gender distinction Furthermore, Uchumataqu uses
the resultative-/faj in a different manner as well
212                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
5.1.1 Simple present tense -u and 0
In the Uchumataqu simple present tense, the first person singular is obligatorily
marked by -u (1). For second person singular to third person plural no verbal markers
exist, so there we only find the verbal stem (2)460.
(1)         wir-i-l       hase-kasi q'a-             ta:-s   pek-u-cay

            'Now, I want to give him / her money.'
            (7cA will gleich Geld geben.' Now, I want to give money.)
                                                                (Uhle 1894:94.2)
(2)         aciwa      cu:l-cay       curka       untuhipu
            sail fill out-DEC great               strong wind
            'The sail fills out, (it is a) great, strong wind.' (Vellard 1949:162)
It is noteworthy that the verbal phrases of first person singular found in Vellard 1951
do not contain the first person singular marker -u (3) and it is only in entire clauses
that the marker occurs (4). No definite explanation can be given for this, but we may
assume that Vellard wishes to present an infinitive form by deleting the first person
singular marker -u.
(3)         wir taxe-cay
            I     sleep-DEC
            'I sleep.'                                                 (Vellard 1951:25)
(4)         am wirakuca cuni-pini pek-u-cay

            'I want [= love] you very much, white man.'                (Vellard 1951:21)
There are some more cases in Métraux (1935) and the work of Vellard (1949-67)
where -u is missing, but those instances are not entirely clear and very often an
interpretation as another person is possible, too (5).
(5)         wist kui-kina     pit-cay
            my house-DiR come-DEC
            'You, (s)he,... come(s) from my house.'
            (To vengo de casa. ')                                       (Vellard 1967:20)
The first person singular marker -u can be preceded by subject marker -s (3, 4) and
object marker -n (4) (cf. 5. 2. 3).
(6)         wir-i-l     tusa                  pa:-s-u(-cay)

   The following statements are restricted to declarative clauses since verbs in interrogative or imperative
clauses behave differently (cf. 7 5 and 7 6).
460
   In Chipaya, -u also serves to mark a first person plural inclusive. However, this is not attested for
Uchumataqu; instead, a first person plural inclusive is unmarked. In Métraux's work (1935) we find some
instances of a first person plural inclusive indicated with -u, but those cases are not entirely clear
Therefore, I consider -u strictly limited to first person singular
CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEM                                                                            213(7)         wilk espejo-ta       wils      yuk cir-s-n-u-cay

            'I see my face in the mirror.'               (Muysken 2005:56)
Since second person singular to third person plural have no marker of their own, no
preceding suffixes can be listed462. The only morpheme that frequently follows verbs
in the simple present tense is declarative -cay, although this is not a rule because in a
few instances it is attached to other constituents as well. When -cay is not used, the
verb is completely unmarked (except for first person singular where -u is attached).
     Although the example clauses are translated as simple present, semantics and /
or pragmatics point into the direction of actions or events happening at the moment
of speech (e.g. examples 1, 2, 6, 7). That is, these actions or events do not take place
over an extended period of time but are restricted in their temporal scope to the
moment of speaking and are therefore seen as conveying a progressive meaning
The following two examples contain a progressive form in their translation.

Since except for first person singular, person reference is not indicated on the verb,
the use of pronouns and clitics should be important to the understanding of a clause.
For second person singular to third person plural it is most common to find a subject
or subject pronoun before the verb, but the use of a subject clitic is exceptional. The
most common way to mark first person singular is to attach -u to the verb, which
itself is preceded by a subject pronoun which bears a subject clitic -/ (cf. 1, 6).
Although it seems crucial to indicate person by pronouns and / or clitics, there are
many instances in which person is not marked at all (except for a first person singular461

The interpretation of -in I -ni as markers of habitual present tense is in part inspired
by the meaning and function these forms have in Chipaya (cf. Cerrón Palomino
2006:148). This is necessary because, the Uchumataqu database for -in I -ni is limited
and the translations given in the sources are not transparent with respect to the
meaning of -in I -ni.
        The form -in and its allomorph -ni are attached to verbs and form part of the
Uchumataqu tense system. They mark a habitual present tense (HP) and are therefore
translated as 'habitually' or 'usually'.

           '[Usually], the mother nurses [breastfeeds] for two years.'
The habitual present tense markers -in I -ni are attached to the verb stem and can be
followed by either declarative -cay or Topic marker -ki (cf. 13, 14). The application
of -in I -ni prevents the use of first person singular -u in present tense, as
demonstrated in (15). This feature points in the direction of a tense marking function
since one would expect first person singular -u to appear if -in I -ni were purely
aspectual. However, they themselves have no person marking function471, so in most
of the cases, a subject or subject pronoun is used to express person reference (cf. Π­
Ι 5). It is not expressed by clitic elements alone.

Habitual present tense -in I -ni is attached to action and action-process verbs
Because of the limited database on -in I -ni they may occur in another verb class as
well, but as expected, we do not find -in I -ni on stative, position, or cognition verbs,
whose meanings already express a habitual concept.
      There are homonymous forms where a linking element /i/ is inserted and
immediately followed by the object marker -n. In such clauses, it can only be
clarified through context whether an habitual present tense is expressed, cf. (16).

With respect to the phonological distribution of habitual present tense -in and its
allomorph -ni, we find free alternation when they appear between two consonants.
After a vowel, -ni follows, while after a consonant -in is applied (either followed by a
vowel or as the final element). In general, -in is employed more often than -ni.                                                     -in      -ni

5.1.3 In-Group marker -acu
The suffix to be described in the following does not entirely belong to the group of
tense marking morphemes but will be treated with these suffixes due to its almost
exclusive use with present tense. The In-Group marker -acu marks a first person
plural exclusive and is therefore best translated as 'we (excl.)', excluding the
addressee. The use of this suffix is remarakble because it can occur with the pronoun
of the first person plural inclusive ucumi 'we (incl.)'.
(17)        ucumi      awaris474-taki lux-acu-cay
            we         SOUI-BEN           eat-m-DEC

            ('ucumi awari-staki lux '-acucay "")                     ( Vellard 1949:167)
However, the use of -acu implies that the addressee is not included, as in (18), where
it is unlikely that the speaker includes the addressee (in this case Vellard) since he
refers to a custom characteristic for his own group. Furthermore, the marker -acu can
be attested only to a certain degree since it is found solely in the works of Métraux
(1935) and Vellard (1949-67). It is in the latter that we find a frequent use of the In-  In one uncertain case we find a possible instance of-in on the weather verb cur- 'to rain'
  This clause refers to funeral habits and means that a meal is prepared in honour of the deceased.
216                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Group marker -acu, but in Métraux it appears only in a few cases. Not only is it
missing in Uhle (1894) as well but such an element is likewise unknown from
Chipaya.
      In-Group marker -acu cannot be satisfactorily integrated into the Uchumataqu
person marking system, but I would like to point to its presumably recent origin. It is
possible that Uchumataqu once had a four-person system consisting of the pronouns
of first to third person singular and ucumi 'we (incl.)'. As outlined under 4.2, ninaka
'they' and wisnaka 'we (excl) 'may have possibly developed only by an increasing
influence of Aymara. This influence may have caused either the 'invention' of -acu
as a verbal bound marker to indicate the newly adopted first person plural exclusive
or the re-interpretation of an already existing but distinctly used morpheme. As a
further support to this assumption may be taken that -acu is reminiscent of first
person plural ucumi and may have been derived from it to create a verbal bound first
plural exclusive marker.
      However, since there is no firm evidence for this in the sources, I will analyse -
acu as the In-Group marker, which excludes the addressee. For the following
discussion, I rely mainly on Vellard (1949-1967).
(18)       alma475 skit'ti-k[i]   huk-acu-cay
           soul    clothes-TOP bum-iN-DEC
           'We bum the soul's clothes.'                           (Vellard 1949:167)

           'We do not know how to swim in the water.' (Vellard 1967:4)
Although In-Group marker -acu is not limited to a specific tense, it is very often
translated as present tense477. However, there are a few instances which are translated
as past tense478 and / or with a person reference other than first person plural
exclusive. These cases are not entirely clear and allow an interpretation as present
tense and first person plural exclusive as well (20).
(20)       wat [aj-kistam pic-acu-cay
           village-SEP      come-lN-DEC
           'We come from the village.'
           (' Yo he venido del pueblo. ')                          (Vellard 1967:29)
Since the form -acu already establishes person reference, the vast majority of all
cases lacks subject pronouns or subject clitics, as in (18) to (20). Thus, the
application of subject pronouns and / or clitics may be considered emphatic, as in
(21, example 17 repeated).","[228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"
"4.2.5.1.1 The second person singular kun
The form kun requires some discussion. It can be interpreted as a second person
singular pronoun and in seventeen out of 25 cases it occurs in interrogative clauses.
Vellard (1967:26) points to this: ""kù [...] an interrogative particle, which is placed at
the beginning of a phrase.""423 That is, the form kun may be interpreted as a second
person singular personal pronoun restricted to interrogative clauses (112 and 113).
(112)          luli  kun-ki      pek
               food you-TOP      want
               'Do you want food?'                                  (Polo 1901:479)
(113)          kun kepck-aki ana(-cay)
               you retum-FU NEG(-DEC)
               'You will return, won't you?'                        (Métraux 1935:106)
What is particularly remarkable is that (with the exception of Uhle and Lehmann) all
documents use both am and kun, although am is by far the more common form. What
is the origin of kun. It may be possible that it is a loan from Aymara cuna 'what?'
(DeLucca 1983:73), with which it shares an interrogative meaning. However, since
cuna means 'what?' and kun clearly denotes a second person singular 'you?', this
proposition seems only partly appropriate. Yet another possibility is that kun derives
from Aymara personal pronoun xuma*24 'you' (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981:122). In this
case, the initial fricative oïxuma would have been replaced by a stop, while the final
vowel /a/ got lost and the bilabial nasal Imi became alveolar Ini. Strikingly, Aymara
xuma is not restricted to interrogative clauses. On the other hand, it is less likely that
a language (even one as endangered as Uchumataqu at the time of documentation)421

    Following other transcription conventions, the second person singular pronoun is represented as juma

borrows only one single pronoun and furthermore changes it considerably with
respect to meaning and / or phonological form. Even if we assume that kun is a native
form of Uchumataqu, it is still remarkable that the language has only one specific
personal pronoun used in interrogative clauses and not a complete set of them.
Finally, it may be possible that kun is the remainder of an older pronominal paradigm
(cf. 4.1.4), but we lack sufficient data to further pursue this claim. In sum, I cannot
provide a satisfying answer to the question of the origin of kun, but would like to
point out that it appears in Polo (1901), Métraux (1935), Vellard (1949, 1951, 1967),
and possibly in Muysken (2005). With respect to morphology, we find that kun takes
clausal clitics and nominal markers (115).

Apart from the examples quoted so far, there are other instances, where what appears
to be kun carries unanalysable elements. Please consider (116).

The form kun is transcribed in several ways. The more common forms are: kum,
kumi, and cun (each found three times), while ku appears two times, and kuma, can[-
Jcu, kon f-J tais426, and kam are single instances. The form kun itself is used ten times
in the data.
     As mentioned above, in eight cases kun appears in non-interrogative clauses as
well (cf. 116). I have no explanation for this. In (118), chun421 is used to denote a
direct object, a use not found elsewhere.

However, Uchumataqu has a rather free word order and nearly all sequences can
occur, although the language has a very strong tendency to place the verb at the end
of a clause. Example (36) shows a marked word order. We may assume that any
word order distinct from the three most common sequences presented above is
marked for reasons of emphasis and / or stress. No increased Spanish influence on
Uchumataqu word order can be established, given also the low level of Uchumataqu-
Spanish bilingualism among the last Uchumataqu speakers.

Imperatives differ from declarative clauses with respect to morphological marking
and, to a certain degree, word order. Imperative marking is: -a or its allomorph -ay
for second person, -x marks an indirect command, while -la expresses an exhortative
and was replaced by cuki V-ki in a later stage of the language (cf. 5.8.1). Declarative
-cay is not used in imperative clauses since it expresses a proposition not yet fulfilled
and whose fulfillment is dependent on the willingness of a person other than the
speaker's (except in exhortative clauses). Most imperative clauses consist only of a
verbal predicate (38), which can be accompanied by manner adverbs (39).

In some cases, the subject is mentioned explicitly, as with the form of cuki V-ki
where the personal pronoun is obligatory. When used with persons other than this, we
may assume that it has an emphatic value, as in e.g. English 'You go!'.

            ('Nosotros trabajaremos [...].')             (Vellard 1967:5)
As demonstrated in (42), imperative clauses may be elaborate and can include direct
and indirect complements. Among these more elaborate clauses, the word orders of
SOV and OSV are the most common ones, although they form only a small part of
the imperative clauses accounted for. Example (41) shows the marked word order of
OSV and the emphatic value is reflected in the translation. Since Uchumataqu is
rather free in its word order, other combinations appear as well but are exceptional.","[293, 294, 295]"

5.7.1 Gerund -ku
Gerund -ku marks the same subject for dependent and independent verb forms and is
best translated by English gerund -ing. In accordance with that, it expresses
simultaneousness.
(92)        am cer-ku txas-txas-u-cay
            you see-GER laugh-laugh-1SG-DEC
            'Seeing you (sg), I laugh [and] laugh.'                           (Uhle 1894:94.2)
(93)        tiki-cay kwas-na521 k'ap-ku
            die-DEC water-LOC sink-GER
            '(S)he died, sinking into the water.'                             (Vellard 1967:4)Gerund -ku is the only element that can be attached to a subordinate verb form528 and
the use of declarative -cay is prohibited on the subordinate form.
     We find gerund -ku attached to action, motion, and cognition verbs and we may
therefore assume that there is no restriction with respect to verb class. Gerund -ku is
not selected by a specific verb or verb class in the matrix position.
      In most cases, the subordinate verb precedes the independent verb, as in
examples (92) and (94), although there are a few exceptions (cf. 93).
     Person reference is expressed either by the use of a subject or subject pronoun or
is otherwise indicated on the verb itself, as in (92) and (94).

The form -na, and its possible variant -an, is found only three times, so the database
on which the following statements are based is severely limited. Furthermore, the
clauses that contain -na are not entirely clear and it may be possible that -na does not
mark subordination at all. However, if we assume that -na is used for subordination,
then it expresses switch reference (glossed as SWR) combined with non-
simultaneousness, i.e. the action expressed by the -«α-marked verb form still has to
happen.(95)        tukunwa tiks-na tacikni litrai     ceri-s-n-a-cay
            woman die-SWR portrait             see-SU-OB2-FU-DEC
            'When the woman dies, I will look at the portrait.' (Vellard 1949:168)527
    Aymara locative form, cf 4 1 1 2 and 4 1.13 Person reference is based on Vellard's translation
528
    In fact, there are two instances in which -ku is preceded by the elements -n; and -na and once, it is
followed by an element -/ Since these cases are not entirely clear, I will treat them as misinterpretations
529
    The word hap- 'to run' is found only in Vellard's work ( 1949-67)
!ï0
    The expression litrai is a loan from Spanish retrato 'portrait' However, the form tacikni remains
uncertain, particularly since Vellard (1949 186, translation mine) himself does not provide a further
analysis but only points out ""I am myself not absolutely sure about the transcription of tiks' na-tacikni, it
is a future form of die, meaning 'the one strechted out"".(""Je ne suis pas absolument sûr de la transcription
de liks' na-tacikni; c'est une forme future de mort, littéralement 'qui est étendu"" )
238                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAThe potential alternative form -an appears only once and there, an interpretation as
verb stem plus object marker -n is possible, too. The translation is based on Métraux
(ibid).
(96)        //' soni        luxl-s-ka-ra     tiks-t-in-cay  luli
            this man        eat-SU?-lC-DT531 die-RES-SR-DEC food
            cuki on-an-ki
            let_us give-swR-TOP
            'This man is nearly starved to death, let's give him food.'
                                                                    (Métraux 1935:97)
The form -an in example (96) is followed by Topic marker -ki, the use of which is
selected by the personal pronoun cuki 'let us'. But even if a clausal element such as
Topic marker -ki can appear on a subordinate verb form, we may assume that the use
of declarative -cay is impossible on a verb subordinated by -an or -na. According to
the examples (95) and (96), no morphemes precede the forms -an or -na.
      The limited database on switch reference subordination markers does not allow
any statement about potential verb class restrictions532, normal word order, or the
distribution of pronominal and clitic elements. With respect to the latter, we may
assume that the use of subjects or subject pronouns is obligatory should -na indeed
mark switch reference. This requirement is fulfilled for examples (95) and (96).
      It seems likely that particularly in its last stage Uchumataqu employed a
coordination strategy rather than switch reference subordination. In examples (97)
and (98), we find simple declarative clauses533 joined by coordination, each
containing its own subject or subject pronoun.

    -ka is glossed as incompletive (IC), -ra as distributive (DT) (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981 208, 281). If Ihis
interpretation is true, both elements are from Aymara origin, although it is not entirely certain whether the
assumption is accurate.
 52
    The three potential instances of -na I -an occur on cognition, action-process, and factive verbs If the
proposed interpretation of-na / -an is correct, the distribution does not point to a restriction with respect to
verb class

    The end of a clause is indicated by declarative -cay (underlined).

5.7.3 Chain verb constructions
What may be understood as a kind of subcategory to subordination are the so-called
chain verb constructions (cf. Muysken 2001:108). The matrix verb is often the
volition verb pek- 'to want' and the complement verb is zero marked, i.e. it consists
of the verb stem alone. Although two different actions (e.g. 'want' and 'eat') are
expressed, these are closely related, as can also be seen by word order, where the
complement verb immediately precedes the matrix verb (cf. chapter 7.8.2).
(99)       wir-l-i      sisa pek-u-cay       kon sunfij-s taqu
           I-CL=1-LV know want-lSG-DECUm-GEN               word, language

(100)      wir-i-l      ci maska            kaye     pek-u-cay
           I-LV-CL=1 one pot                buy      want-lSG-DEC
           'I want to buy one pot.'                                       (Métraux 1935:90)
If at all, chain verb constructions come closest to what could be described as
coreferential and non-simultaneous, although there are counterexamples such as
(101), which is simultaneous.
(101)         ana-l          cita puiti-u""6
              NEG-CL=1 lift can-lSG
              'I can't lift (it).'

With respect to verb class, we find chain verb constructions involving action,
cognition, utterance, and motion verbs537. Although the database is limited, we may
assume that there is no restriction with regard to verb class. As in simple declarative
clauses, person reference is expressed mainly by the use of a subject or subject
pronoun, the latter one is frequently inflected with a subject clitic (cf. 99 and 100).","[253, 254, 255, 256]"
"1.4.2.3.1 Manuscript from Ancoaqui (fair copy)
As Lehmann states in the fair copy, he visited Ancoaqui on October 12th 1929 and
made the fair copy the following day in La Paz, which means he spent only one day
in the community79. The fair copy consists of 26 pages80 with 453 entries, which are
mainly lexical. Until p. 21 Lehmann provides only nouns and adjectives, which cover
several semantic fields. It is noteworthy that the nouns refer mainly to concrete
objects, such as e.g. 'house', 'broom', 'knee', etc., although Lehmann also reports
kinship terms, such as 'brother-/sister-in-law' and some terms designating religious
phenomena, such as 'soul'. These purely lexical entries are followed on pages 21 and
22 by the numerals 1 to 10, 20 and 100, the personal pronouns, and a possessive
paradigm exemplified by the word 'house'. On pages 23 and 24 Lehmann presents
the drawing of a traditional Andean loom and ten Uchumataqu terms referring to its
parts. It is only on the last two pages (p. 25, 26) of his manuscript that Lehmann
gives some grammatical information. This consists of conjugations of the verbs 'to
be' and 'to give' and although the latter is supposed to be transitive, we find no
object expressed, i.e. Lehmann asked for 'I give', 'you give' and so on. He also
presents the forms 'I was', 'I am not', and 'I was not', which are single entries
without full paradigms. Page 25 also contains what appears to be a repetition of the
possessive paradigm presented on p. 22. On the last page Lehmann supplies the
intransitive form 'I die' and four examples of the transitive verb 'to kill': 'I kill you',
'you kill me', 'he kills me', and 'I kill him'.
     The following unnumbered page shows Lehmann's hypothesis about a possible
genetic relationship between Uchumataqu and Atacameno81 and correspondingly, he
presents a comparative word list of 46 lexemes of these two languages on another
two pages (A and B). On the following two pages (a and ß) Lehmann compares

CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                              37
Uchumataqu with Mochica but points out that it has to be considered a ""preliminary
attempt""82 (Lehmann 1929b, a, translation mine). This list consists of 26 lexical items
as well as the numerals 5 and 6. Lehmann does not mention his sources for the
Atacameno and Mochica terms but the Uchumataqu terms must be from Ancoaqui
since Lehmann produced the list on October 13th 1929 in La Paz, i.e. two weeks
before he visited Ch'imu. However, he must have returned later to this material since
the lists are followed by a final remark, in which Lehmann explains that further
research on the Puquina texts of Ore is required to clarify the linguistic situation at
the northern coast of Peru. The note is dated April 24th 1931.
       Lehmann uses Spanish in his manuscript with the exception of the introduction
and the description of the loom and its parts. However, Lehmann did not speak
Quechua or Aymara, as becomes apparent in the introduction to the Ch'imu
manuscript (Lehmann 1929d:ii)83. Since the Uchumataqu speakers did not understand
Spanish, Lehmann needed an interpreter to communicate with them (Lehmann
1929b:i)8'1. He describes the interview situation as follows: ""Using my synoptical
word lists the conversation with the Uru was pursued by the interpreter in Spanish,
Aymara, and Quechua.""85 (Lehmann 1929b:i). The interpreter (Lehmann 1929d:ii)86
is described as speaking not only Spanish but also Aymara and Quechua fluently.
However, some confusion arises with respect to the names and numbers of
interpreters actually involved. As Lehmann mentions on the first page to the
Ancoaqui manuscript (and repeats in the more detailed introduction to the Ch'imu
manuscript) he was accompanied by only one interpreter, but on the second page he
gives the names of two men he refers to as interpreters: Chunak kasi and Mariano
Kispe87. However, on p. 23 / 43488 Lehmann declares Suma Ch'ufiak kasi to be the
alleged name of his main language consultant. Lehmann does not further clarify the
situation of interpreters and language consultants involved, but I suppose that there
has been a misunderstanding since cuna-kasi is an Uchumataqu expression meaning
'it is well' or in the case of suma cuna-kasi 'it is very well'89. It is thus probable that
Lehmann interpreted as a name what in fact was only an agreement uttered by one of
his consultants. Lehmann himself seems to have mistrusted the statement of his
language consultant as he refers to it as the alleged name. Apart from these not
entirely clear notes Lehmann does not provide further specifications on his language
consultants or interpreter and their personal backgrounds. However, since Lehmann
refers to Chunak kasi as his ""main informant"" we may assume that other persons
were involved too. We do not know what kind of relationship there was between

visit to Ancoaqui
87
    Posnansky (1934 264) lists the names of Manano Kispe (sen ) and Manano Kispe (jun ) and it is thus
possible that Minano Kispe indeed was not the interpreter but rather one of Lehmann's language

Lehmann and his language consultant(s) and given the short time Lehmann spent in
Ancoaqui it further seems doubtful whether there was any particular relationship at
all. However, according to Lehmann the Uchumataqu speakers were sympathetic
about the interview situation and encouraged him to learn their language. This
remained his only visit.
     Taking this into consideration as well as the fact that most of Lehmann's data
are lexical, we find them less suitable for a grammatical description. However, when
compared to other sources, the vast majority of Lehmann's lexemes can be verified,
which is also true for his basic grammatical observations. As Uhle and Polo,
Lehmann visited Ancoaqui at a time when fully competent native speakers of
Uchumataqu were apparently still alive. This is reflected in his data, which contain
elements that cannot be found in later documents, e.g. the pronominal plural marker -
wici. Thus, the data provided by Lehmann can be judged reliable but less appropriate
for a grammatical description since they are mainly lexical.","[53, 54, 55]"
"1.4.3.3 Pieter Muysken
Among other research areas, Pieter Muysken has worked and published on language
contact situations of Caribbean and South American languages. He works at the
Radboud University Nijmegen.
     Pieter Muysken published an article based on Vellard's material on Uchumataqu
in 2000 {Drawn into the Aymara mold? Notes on Uni Grammar), in which he
describes features of Uchumataqu, such as reduplication, incorporation, suffixation,
and particularly the declarative Marker -cay, explaining possible links with Aymara.
     In April and May 2001 Pieter Muysken visited Irohito and collected about 800
words on several semantic fields, such as kinship terms, body parts, plants and fruits
as well as numerals 1 to 20 and 100. He worked with several members of the
community, among them Lorenzo Inda and his nephew Cyriaco Inda as well as
Desiderio Lopez Inda, Nicolas Salinas, and Teodoro Vila. On a second visit in

    I am very grateful to Colette Gnnevald who allowed me access to her material on Uchumataqu
56                       UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
August 2001, Muysken met Teodoro Vila's older sister Julia Vila, who can be
described as the last speaker to be considerably fluent in Uchumataqu. Julia Vila
acquired Uchumataqu by her grandmother, who used this language when talking to
her. Julia Vila contributed a number of new words to the vocabulary and was also
able to produce a short text about the Uru's past and their ancient deity called
Uphana. Part of the results of this field-work campaign were published in 2001 under
the title El uchumataqu (Uru) de Irohito. Observaciones preliminares. Apart from
Julia Vila's story, the article is concerned with the genetic affiliation of Uru-Chipaya,
the current situation of Uchumataqu as well as phonological and grammatical
observations. Pieter Muysken returned to Irohito in March and April 2002 to present
and further check the vocabulary resulting from his first field trip to Irohito in 2001.
     The most comprehensive part of the field-work results, however, was published
2005 in the form of a vocabulary titled El idioma Uchumataqu. It contains the
vocabulary mentioned above, and all in all there are 240 phrases and clauses. Some
of them are very brief and consist of two words only, while other are more elaborate
and include imperative and interrogative clauses. Furthermore, two songs recorded
with Lorenzo Inda in August 2001 are also included. A brief description of the
studies carried out on Uchumataqu so far as well as some texts published by Vellard
1949 are also provided.
     It is the publication El idioma Uchumataqu that is considered for the current
work. The lexical material is part of the lexicon while the phrases and clauses are in
part considered for the grammatical description. However, one has to take into
consideration that the language has been dead for almost half a century in 2001 and
even Julia Vila probably did not make regular use of Uchumataqu. Therefore, the
phrases and clauses will only be considered when they can be confirmed by other
sources, e.g. Uhle or Métraux. Features found only in this most recent publication on
Uchumataqu can be ascribed to the strong Aymara influence on the remaining
speakers and their long disuse of Uchumataqu.
2 PHONOLOGY
In the following sections I will describe the phonological system of Uchumataqu as
well as the context-sensitive processes observed in the language. A final section will
deal with the syllable and stress patterns of Uchumataqu and the spelling conventions
used in subsequent chapters.","[72, 73, 74]"

    For a more detailed discussion on these elements and the reason for which they are termed clitics, cf.

CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                     135
Uchumataqu affixes can be characterised by the so-called ""relevance principle"", as
presented by Bybee (1985:15f): ""[...] semantic elements that are highly relevant to
one another are likely to be packaged together and expressed lexically, or will be the
most common inflectional or derivational categories."". That is, categories that are
generally thought of as most relevant, such as tense, aspect, mood, number, and case
are expressed in Uchumataqu as either derivational or inflectional (bound)
morphemes.
      For the distinction between derivation and inflection, I would like to follow
Booij (2006:654, 656): ""The distinction between inflection and derivation is
primarily a functional one: it refers to different functions of morphological processes,
the creation of different forms of lexemes versus the creation of different lexemes."",
and further ""[...] derivation may change the syntactic category of its input forms,
whereas inflection is always category-neutral. [...] [I]nflection creates forms of the
same lexeme, unlike derivation, which determines the lexical category of the lexemes
it creates."". Thus, by derivation I understand that the application of a grammatical,
bound morpheme can change the syntactic category of its host. Inflectional affixes do
not have this ability.
      Based on this definition, I view action nominaliser -s(i), subject relativiser -ni,
related State marking -tni (and its allomorph -tin) as well as causative -sna (and its
allomorph -ska) to be derivational. The following examples demonstrate their usage.
      Both action nominaliser -s(i) and subject relativiser -ni nominalise a verb stem
and these suffixes thus match the criterion for derivational affixes. Please consider
examples (21) and (22).
(21)       pot-si
           cut-AN
           'a knife (lit: 'that which is for cutting')'             (Uhle 1894:64)
(22)       sis-ni-ki
           know-SR-TOP
           'a sorcerer (lit.: 'the one who knows')'                (Métraux 1935:96)
                                                     2U
The application of State marking -tni I -tin to verbs produces adjectives (cf. 4.3.5)
and thus, both these markers are considered derivational (see examples 23 and 24).(23)       lik-tni
           drink-ST
           'drunk (lit.: 'the one who drank')'                     (Métraux 1935:99)

136                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
The causative marker -sna and its allomorph -ska do not change word class, since a
verb stem to which -sna (or -ska) is attached remains a verb. However, attaching the
causative morpheme has syntactic and semantic implications, as expressed by Booij
(2006:656): ""[...] the derivation of causative verbs leads to the creation of transitive
verbs that indicate the obligatory presence of a direct object [...]. Hence, the
derivation of causative verbs has syntactic relevance."". Apart from this syntactic
impact, derivation of causative verbs often leads to a semantic difference, which
sometimes results in lexical causatives, such as e.g. 'to eat' and 'cause somebody to
eat = to feed'. The Uchumataqu causative fits into this scheme, since it introduces a
new participant286 and produces new lexical items.
(25)        cis-                  'to speak'
            cis-[s]na             'to cause someone to speak = to teach someone'
                                                            (Métraux 1935:103,96)
(26)        kaxa                  'debt'
            pkaxsna-cay           'to cause somebody to be indebted = to lend'
                                                            (Uhle 1894:100)
Example (27) presents a lexical causative:
(27)        tiks-     'to die'          kona- 'to kill'              (Métraux 1935:101, 108)
Another possible example of a lexical causative is the verb skata- 'to send' (Vellard
1967:9), which could have been constructed of causative -ska and the verb ta: 'to
give', meaning 'to cause somebody to give = to send'. Problematic is that the
potential causative form precedes the verb stem, which otherwise must not be the
case. If skata- has indeed been derived this way, we may assume that it has been
completely lexicalised at the time of documentation. Since further examples are
missing, this has to remain speculative.
     In sum, the majority of Uchumataqu affixes is inflectional and only the forms
discussed above are considered derivational.
     With respect to the order of affixes, ""[i]t is often observed that derivational
morphemes occur closer to the root to which they attach than inflectional morphemes
do"" (Bybee 1985:33). In Uchumataqu, we find that on nouns and pronouns the plural
marker precedes case suffixes, which themselves can be followed by clausal clitics.
This observation is in accordance with Bybee's findings (1985:34)287. In most cases,
adjectives and adverbs are zero marked. However, if they take markers, we find a
situation similar to nouns, i.e. case markers (on adverbs) or predicator -kasi (on both
categories) are attached directly to the stem and can be followed by clausal clitics.
Only verbs tend to have a higher number of affixes, although it rarely exceeds two
affixes per verb stem. This limitation makes it somewhat difficult to determine the
position an affix can take, i.e. although it may be attached directly to the stem, it is    The form -sna occurs with (transitive) cognition (e.g. sis- 'to know') and utterance verbs (e.g. cis- 'to
speak') as well as with (intransitive) states, which then become transitive. Its allomorph -ska appears only
with (transitive) action and action-process verbs (e.g cer- 'to see, look at' and kos- 'to break')

possible that it is preceded by a number of empty slots. Some morpheme
combinations never occur, although in theory they could and therefore, it remains
likewise uncertain whether these morphemes occupy the same slot or different ones.
However, despite these restrictions I propose the following order of verbal
morphemes in Uchumataqu, but it is tentative, and the position of some affixes can
only be assumed.","[151, 152, 153, 154]"
"3.1 Roots, stems, and words
Before describing the morphological entities of Uchumataqu, I would like to point to
a somewhat inconsistent use of terminology in the literature. Thus, particularly the
terms 'root' and 'stem' are often used in contradictory ways and what is defined as
'root' in one study describes a 'stem' in another one. I will adopt a definition for the
terms 'root' and 'stem' that is not bound to a certain theory, as provided by Payne
(1997:24). According to this author, a root can be defined as ""an unanalyzable form
that expresses the basic lexical content of the word,"", while stem can be described as
""consist[ing] minimally of a root, but may be analyzable into a root plus derivational
morphemes. [...] Like a root, a stem may or may not be a fully understandable
word."". Example (1) presents some roots of Uchumataqu.
(1)       un-                   'to give, lend'                  (Polo 1901:478)
          oq-                   'to go'                          (Uhle 1894:90)
          soni                  'man, human being'               (Métraux 1935:98)
          kaku                  'net'                            (Vellard 1949:163)
The following items may be analysed as Uchumataqu stems.
(2)       yuxki okni            'guide'                          (Lehmann 1929b:7)
          cerini                ' looked at, upon '              (Uhle 1894:71 )
The expression yuxki okni 'guide' is a compound that consists of the directional
adverb yuxki 'in front of and the verb ok- 'to go', which is nominalised by the
subject relativiser -ni. The construction can literally be translated as 'the one who
goes ahead'. The component okni, literally 'goer', is interpreted as a stem. The
second example cerini 'looked at, upon' can be analysed as consisting of the verb
cer- 'to see' and an adjectival state marker -ini. The application of the marker -mi
turns the verb into an adjectival state (cf. 3.6.2 and 4.3.5). It has to be noted that the
instances in (2) are exceptional since in many cases the difference between roots and
stems is not visible in Uchumataqu. For example, the expression sisni 'sorcerer'
(example mine) can be analysed as being composed of the verbal root sis- 'to know'
and the subject relativiser -ni, meaning 'the one who knows'. In this case, sisni can
be analysed as a stem. It can also be interpreted as the lexicalised expression
'sorcerer', in which case it would be a root. Since the degree of lexicalisation of a
particular term often remains uncertain, I will prefer the term 'stem' over 'root'.275
     With respect to the number of syllables in stems (cf. 2.13.1), we find that
nominal and adjectival stems can have up to three syllables. Forms consisting of four

syllables are the result of compounding and lexicalisation processes, as e.g. in
pikiltani 'the two together', where the Numeral pisk 'two' is combined with
comitative Marker -stani and linking element -il. However, on the average, adverbs
tend to have either one or two syllables. If an adverb comprises three syllables, this is
likewise the result of a lexicalisation process, as in wirwina 'last' (Vellard 1951:19),
which is composed of win 'back; anus' and an unanalysable element -wina. Verbal
stems are likewise limited to a maximum of two syllables. However, since verbs are
almost always inflected with morphological markers, the final stem vowel is often
deleted during this process and thus, verbs often appear to be monosyllabic, although
the stem is actually bisyllabic. Only in a few cases the final stem vowel is maintained
during inflection, as can be seen in examples (3) and (4) (final stem vowel bold).
(3)       ceri-s-n-a-cay
          see-su-OB2-FU-DEC
          'I will see it.'                              (Vellard 1949:168)
(4)       pica-x
          come-JU
          '(S)he shall come!'                           (Uhle 1894:92.2)
The elision of the final stem vowel caused by inflection often makes it necessary to
reconstruct it.
     Only in interrogative and subordinate clauses, as well as in chain verb
constructions do verbs appear in the shape of their stem (see also sections 5.7.3, 7.6,
and 7.8.2). Nominal stems, on the other hand, can occur without marking, as is
frequently the case with subjects and direct objects, which are only optionally marked
by topic marker -ki. The same situation is found with adjectival and adverbial stems,
particularly in attributive function, where they are often zero marked (cf. 3.2).
     However, both verbal and nominal stems form the basis for further inflectional
and derivational processes, as shown in the following examples (stems bold).
(5)       hisk-n-u-cay
          afraid-OB2-lSG-DEC
          'it frightens me'                             (Vellard 1949:166)

          sleep-AN
          'bed (lit.: 'that which is for sleeping')'    (Métraux 1935:100)
Adjectival and adverbial stems take nominal morphological markers as well, but can
also be inflected with adjectival predicator -kasi (cf. 4.3.3 and 6.1.6).
(8)        sies-kfisjtani
          yesterday-SEP
          'since yesterday'                             (Uhle 1894:23,49)

(9)       yafsij-kasi
          now-PRE
          'it is now'                                  (Vellard 1949:162)
Before turning to the average number of affixes per morpheme and the related
question of the tyological profile of the language, I will discuss the basis on which
the items quoted in (5) to (9) can be termed 'words'. That is, how is it possible to say
that e.g. yafsij-kasi (example 9) is construed of one single word and not of two, such
as *ya[si]ka si. As the discussion of phonology (chapter 2) has shown, phonological
criteria are a less reliable means for establishing word boundaries and thus, I will
adopt a syntactic definition of the term 'word', as provided by Anderson (1985:153):
""The units which can thus be permuted or interrupted freely by other 'words' can
therefore be taken to establish a syntactic notion of ""word."". Examples (10) and (11)
present such cases.
(10)      wala-kfij       aski-cay   iyai
          village-TOP far-DEC         more
          'The village is further away.'               (Métraux 1935:100)
(11)      wata iya-cay aski-n
          village more-DEC far-?
          'The village is further away.'               (Métraux 1935:104)
Sentences such as (10) and (11) establish wata, iya, and aski as discrete lexical items,
whereas no similar case involving -kasi can be found. Thus, e.g. iya can be
established as a word, while -kasi cannot. Once word boundaries are established, they
can be further supported by morphological and even phonological evidence, such as
that e.g. declarative -cay is always word final, and that words do not begin with /r/.","[146, 147, 148]"

    With the exception of uskalan 'a moment, in a moment' Métraux (1935:101) Métraux presents the
form as either uskatan-kama or uskatan-kasi, ι e. the expression can take a nominal as well as an adjectival
morpheme. However, the expression occurs only once and cannot be verified for sources other than
Métraux and therefore I do not regard it as a meaningful form of Uchumataqu.

    According to Vellard (ibid ), caka- means 'ready' However, the translation given in Muysken
(2005 49) is 'to launch' which seems more appropriate in this context.

    Aymara has a suffix -pacha (DeLucca 1983:328), which denotes totality and is probably the one
occunng on wakpaca 'all, everything' (cf 4.3.4). However, the temporal relation expressed here suggests
that it is the noun pacha that it used rather than the totality marking suffix

6.1.2 Spatial adverbs
The group of spatial adverbs contains expressions such as tiksi 'here', kela Outside',
asqi 'far away', hos- 'down' and the directions eia 'north', xana 'south', tun 'east',
and taxa 'west'. The latter can also serve to indicate 'up' or 'down'. Some adverbs
occur as temporal as well as spatial modifiers, e.g.: wir(i)wina 'back; last' and
nikstani 'afterwards'576. As wir(i)wina, the adverb yuki 'in front of is clearly related
to a body part, in this cast yuki 'face'.
      In most cases, spatial adverbs do not take morphological markers at all, as in
examples (6) and (7).
(6)        qela ulan-a
           out leave-iMP
           'Get out!'                                            (Uhle 1894:96.2)
(7)        wakpaks-tafki] kinsi                         cila    cila    sek-cay
           all-BEN      fishingenclosure                another another be-DEC

           away.'                                       (Vellard 1949:163)
However, if spatial adverbs take morphological markers, these are either nominal (8)
or clausal. In contrast to temporal adverbs, no exceptions occur.
(8)        haski-na ok""[a]-acu-cay kam                 pa:-s-xapa

           'We go [to a place] far away for making a totora rope.'
                                                       (Vellard 1949:154)
The four directions and the adverb os 'down' are exceptional in that they can be
combined with the suffix -carku which is best translated as '-wards'. The suffix -
carku occurs with the four directions, the adverb hos-, and the postposition kos
'inside' (cf. 6.2.4). Since it occurs mainly on adverbs, it is glossed as an adverbial
direction marker (AD).
(9)        sik-carku     k'uya tax-cay
           north/up-AD house cover-DEC
           'Above, the house is covered, (lit.: Northwards / upwards ...)' 578
                                                        (Vellard 1950:69)

  As mentioned above, the four directions also serve to indicate 'up' or 'down' The example clause
means that the house has a roof

In some cases, -carku is not translated as '-wards' (11) and it is not entirely certain
whether this is due to some misunderstanding, to a certain degree of lexicalisation of
-carku, or to language attrition. However, in the majority of all cases, -carku
expresses movement into a direction.
(11)        xana-carku
            south-AD
            'south'                                                  (Métraux 1935:107)
The form -carku can be combined with clausal clitics although this happens only in a
few cases. Usually, -carku is not followed by other morphemes and is directly
attached to the adverbial stem.
     The following instance is the only one where a form -paca is attached to what
appears to be a locational / directional adverb.
( 12)       siq-paca         pic-u-cay
            far away_place come-1SG-DEC
            'I came from [a place] far away.'                        (Muysken 2005:26)
As indicated in the glosses, (-)paca has been analysed here as meaning 'place' (Lira
1944:720), i.e. as a noun. Thus, it is probably a loan from Quechua since in Aymara,
paca is restricted to a temporal meaning (DeLucca 1983:328). According to the
translation, it may be possible to analyse the element siq- as being an alternative form
ofasqi 'faraway'.
      Together with temporal adverbs, spatial adverbs form a nominally encoded
subclass of adverbs and are conceptually close, as can be seen from forms used both
in a temporal and locational / directional sense.","[270, 271, 272]"
