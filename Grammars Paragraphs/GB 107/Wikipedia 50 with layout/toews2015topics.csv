2.3.4.2.4 NPI wo
The particle wo has some characteristics of a negative polarity item (NPI): Wo occurs mainly in
negative clauses, but it is not obligatory in negative clauses. It can also occur in certain types of
affirmative questions (Adger 2003). The data available at this point are compatible with it being
an NPI, so that is how I have chosen to gloss it.",[81]

3.4.4.2 Imperfective Uses Negative Particle with VO Order
Imperfectives are negated by a particle. The particle does not cause a change in word order. In
the affirmative sentence in (77a), the verb (na) precedes the object (tawa), the same as (76a). In
the negative sentence (77b), the verb still precedes the object.77.    language: Dewoin (from Marchese 1986:168)       a.       S                              V        O              affirmative

"       The difference between auxiliaries and particles is that auxiliaries always occur in clauses
where the basic word order is S(Aux)OV whereas particles occur in clauses where the basic
word order is S(Part)VO. Thus, negative auxiliaries induce a change in word order from SVO in
the affirmative (35a) to S(Aux)OV in the negative (76b). Negative particles do not have such an
effect (77b).
       Notice in (78) that the object kùà and the verb nu are reversed from one example to the
next: the negative perfective has OV word order while the negative imperfective has VO word
order. It also appears that the verbs are uninflected in this case, since the verb for the perfective
(78a) and imperfective utterances have the same form.",[178]

the ordering of the verb and the object.36.    language: Dewoin (from Marchese 1986:168)       a.      ɔ-ɔ                            na    tawa.           affirmative

"2.5.1.1 Kru Languages Are SVO and S Auxiliary OV
Kru languages have mixed word order properties. If there is no auxiliary, the word order is SVO
but in certain environments (such as negative clauses), the order may change to S Auxiliary OV.
The affirmative clause in (127a) has SVO order, but when the same clause is negated with an
auxiliary (127b), the order of the object and the verb is reversed, and the order is S Aux OV.127.    language: Dewoin (from Marchese 1986:168)        a.       ɔ                          pi       sayɛ̀.                     affirmative

"3.4.4.1 Perfective Uses Negative Auxiliary with OV Order
All perfectives in the Kru languages discussed by Marchese (1986) are negated by an auxiliary.
The auxiliary causes the word order to change from VO to OV. Example (76a) shows an
affirmative perfective. Notice that the verb (pi) precedes the object (sayɛ̀). Example (76b) is a
perfective negated by the auxiliary se. In this sentence, the object precedes the verb.",[177]

2.3.4.3.2 Negative bo

2.3.4.2.2 ki 'non-finiteness'
The particle ki is used in a number of non-finite environments, including non-verbal predicates,
imperatives, temporal anaphora, and irrealis/modal subordinate clauses.
         First of all, ki occurs in copular clauses, which have no main verb (Haas 2004).39
Example (64) shows affirmative copular clauses and (65) shows a negative copular clause.64.      Àníi     ki       myɛ́n ɔ?                    Àníi      ki   hlaŋ ɔ.

         Cows are not birds. (Haas 2004)38
   There are other when-type words that also occur in a pre-predicate position. For example, mùkar (when for future
events) and mùfɔn (when for past events). The particles bè and ki (and maybe even ri) can form if/when-type clauses
as well, depending on context.
39
   One might argue that the copula is a verb. However, if it is, it is different from other Siamou verbs in that it does
not inflect for aspect. It also has a different segmental melody, since it consists of only a vowel nucleus and has no
onset, which is not the case for any other Siamou verb.","[74, 75]"

"         In a negated polar question, the question particle always follows the negative particle
(105a). Note that bo becomes be in that environment;55 bo followed by a is ungrammatical54
   To complete the paradigm, an example is needed in which both instances of ín follow bo. Such an example is
predicted to be unacceptable because the most preferred order is ín bo.
55
   The bo/be alternation may just be a phonological change, but if so, it is the only one of its kind that I am aware of
in Siamou. It may also be a different negation particle which also occurs in negative imperatives (i).",[92]
"
125
    The verbs in (Table 3.37k-n) all have a coda r while none of the other verbs in this table do. In these verbs (but
not the others), /i/ is pronounced [ɪ], and this is likely related to the fact that they pattern differenctly in the
perfective and imperfective forms (Paul Thiessen p.c).
126
    The verb form dénno is unusual. It often acts as the perfective of the verb don (go). However, the actual (regular)
perfective of don is dòn. There are rules governing the use of dòn versus dénno which I am not very familiar with.
However, the first form occurs more in negative clauses and the latter occurs more in affirmative clauses. The verb
form dénno patterns differently in the grammar as well. For example, dénno can occur with the non-finite particle ki,
which no other perfective can do, suggesting that it is probably not a perfective, although it functions as one in many
cases. It is possible that dénno is multi-morphemic. Siamou has a suffix -no which means something like 'go', and
this suffix can attach to some other bare verbs. I am not sure what the dén would be in that case.
Throughout this thesis, I have glossed dénno as go.PRFV?. The ? indicates that I am not sure of its status.",[188]

         Wo can occur with all the aspectual suffixes except the completive and the prospective
aspect 2. In (80) I show negative clauses that contain wo and the right-edge negative particle bo.
I give one example for each of Siamou's six aspectual suffixes (see chapter 3), of which the final
two are ungrammatical. In these cases, wo seems to strengthen the negative force of bo

Example (81e) shows that the completive is not grammatical with a ri. . .bo negative
construction. The difference between the negatives with ri and the wo negatives is that the wo
negatives have a little more negative force than the ri negatives (Souleymane Traoré p.c).","[81, 82]"
"        Unlike auxiliaries, particles do not cause a change in word order. In (128), there is a
negative particle with a VO word order. This is the main way particles are distinguished from
auxiliaries in Kru languages: they do not cause a change in word order, while auxiliaries do
(Marchese 1986).",[111]
"These judgments, however, are not very clear. Although utterances such as (102b) are often
judged ungrammatical, sometimes they are accepted, with a comment such as, ""That's not really
the logical way to say it, but people sometimes talk this way.""
       In fact, in rare cases it is even possible to have two instances of ín in the same negative
clause, one preceding negation and one following it (103a). If there was only one ín after bo and
none before it, it was judged slightly less acceptable (103b). Two instances of ín both preceding
bo was definitely unacceptable (103c). Just one ín preceding bo was the most acceptable (103d).",[91]

Above the aspect phrase there is a locative phrase which contains two particles fɔn 'be here' and
mí 'be there.' I put these two particles in the same syntactic position because they are in
complementary distribution and because they are both locatives. I put them at the bottom of all
the functional particles because whenever they occur with another pre-predicate particle they are
always to the right of the other particle (e.g. ri fɔn, wo mí) (see 2.3.4.2.8).

                                                                                                  50
these particles in the same syntactic position because they never co-occur. I put them above the
locative phrase because wo precedes mí if they co-occur (wo mí).
        The next level up is the finite phrase which contains the non-finite particle ki and the
finite particle ri. (The labels for these particles is also tentative.) I put these particles in the same
syntactic position because they never co-occur and because they both seem to have something to
do with finiteness. If ki or ri occur with another pre-predicate particle, they are always to the left
of the other particle (e.g. ki bè, ri bè, ki wo, ri mí).
        Above the finite phrase is the TP, which contains the right edge particle ín. This particle
precedes all other right edge particles (see 2.3.4.3). I placed the TP as close as possible to the
finite phrase, since I expect both of them to be part of the IP.
        The phrase above TP is the NegP which contains the right edge particle bo (sometimes
be) NEG. I put this particle above ín PAST because ín always precedes bo (although see (103a.)).
        Above this is the CP, which contains the pre-predicate particle nì 'if/when.' This particle
is in complementary distribution with ki and ri in the finite phrase. Nonetheless, I chose to give it
its own position because of its function. That is, it seems to fit into the CP better than the IP.
        Immediately above the CP is another functional phrase that contains two right-edge
particles: a polar question particle a and an emphatic particle na. I put these particles in the same
position because they never co-occur. I put them above the NegP because they always follow
negation (be a, bo na).
        The highest level in the tree is the quotative phrase which contains the quotative particle
dé. I placed this particle at the top because it precedes all other elements of the phrase. Since I
am focusing on functional particles, this tree does not include the subject of the sentence.
However, I assume that the subject is generated inside the VP and raises to a position higher in
the clause. In Siamou the subject precedes all pre-predicate particles. The only particle that
precedes the subject is the quotative dé. Therefore, the subject likely raises as high as the CP.
        The subsections below look in more detail at each these functional elements. In 2.3.4.1 I
introduce the quotative, dé, in 2.3.4.2 the set of seven pre-predicate particles, and 2.3.4.3 the set
of four right-edge particles. The final section, 2.3.4.4, is about some unusual verb stems.","[72, 73]"

Other similarities between Siamou and other Kru languages include a number of grammatical
morphemes that appear to be cognates (such as the negative particle bo in Siamou and the
negative particle be in Grebo), and word order, both in the verbal and nominal domains. Person
(1966) also gives a historical explanation for the geographical distance between Siamou and the
other Kru languages, arguing that Kru languages were originally spoken further north than they
are now, in Ivory Coast and Liberia, until the Mandé and the Maninka pushed them out. Most of
them moved south, except for the Siamou, who fled north into Burkina Faso (Person 1966).",[101]

   In fact, this might be a more general pattern with pre-predicate particles in Siamou: ri seems to occur in most
finite clauses (bearing in mind that it drops out frequently in casual speech) unless there is another particle, in which
case ri does not occur. The following minimal set shows that ri alternates with wo and bè in negative clauses. These
utterances have not been analyzed, but their interpretations are very interesting because they all express different
kinds of modality.i.       À       ri        bɛ-a               bo.

2.5.3 Siamou Is an Outlier Relative to Other Kru Languages
Of the 39 Kru languages, most fit into two branches: a western branch (23 languages) and an
eastern branch (11 languages). Of the remaining five languages, three belong to the Aiza group,
spoken in Ivory Coast. Two languages, Kuwaa and Siamou, do not belong to any subgroup
(Marchese 1983, Lewis et al. 2013).
       This means that we expect Siamou not to show stronger similarity to Western Kru
languages than to Eastern Kru languages, nor the other way around. It may have some properties
that resemble Western Kru languages, some that resemble Eastern Kru languages, and some
properties that are distinct from both. Chapter 3 looks at how Siamou perfective and imperfective
aspect compare with these aspects in Kru. I argue that the Siamou perfective is a L tone suffix.
However, in surface form, sometimes the L tone surfaces, and sometimes it does not. In Kru, the
general pattern is that the Western branch has an unmarked perfective and the Eastern branch has
a L tone perfective. Thus, the surface forms of Siamou perfectives sometimes resemble Western
Kru perfectives and sometimes resemble Eastern Kru perfectives. Siamou differs from both
Western and Eastern Kru languages, however, in the formation of negative perfectives. In the
other languages, negating a perfective structure with a negative auxiliary causes a change in
word order from VO to OV. In Siamou, the word order is always OV, and there is no change in
word order when perfectives are negated.","[117, 118]"

       In the same way, by adding past tense ín to a sentence that already has a past tense
interpretation, you are choosing an utterance like the one in (11b) instead of the one in (11a).
There must be a reason for it. One reason for this could be that the speaker is signaling that the
event is more distant in the past, as discussed in 6.4.1. However, sometimes it may be clear from
the context that the event is not more distant in the past, and in those cases there has to be
another reason that the speaker would choose to use past tense ín. It is in these contexts that the
politeness and doubt readings are predicted to arise. At this point I do not have a clear
explanation for how this happens, so I set it aside for future research.11.    a.      N̂      srɔ́ɔ              jɔ=ɔ̂        ri      sɛl             duklɔ́.

"        Siamou differs from the other Kru languages in that it does not make use of different
negation strategies to differentiate between perfective and imperfective clauses. Instead, both are
negated with a clause final particle, bo.119 In fact, Siamou does not distinguish at all between
second-position particles and auxiliaries like Kru does. The word order is always S (Part) O V.

           g.       It is sometimes useful to give questions in pairs so that the consultant can contrast
                    one form with another. For example, instead of eliciting a set of perfective
                    utterances and then a set of imperfective utterances, elicit them as minimal pairs:
                    one perfective utterance with a matching imperfective utterance.

"7.3.4 The Three Future Expressions Can Refer to Events That Are Not Expected to
Happen
The previous three diagnostics support my claim that Siamou's three future expressions encode
prospective aspect. In this and the next section I show that in addition to expressing prospective
aspect, these future expressions are also all modal. To prove that they are modal, I show that in
certain contexts, a speaker can utter a future expression even if he is quite sure that the event he
is referring to will not actually occur (48). If the future expressions in Siamou were purely
temporal, this would not be possible. This is because modality allows for branching futures in
which more than one outcome is possible—some in which the event occurs, and some in which it
does not. A future that is purely temporal (which likely does not exist) would only have one
possible outcome. Example (48c) is particularly interesting because the affirmative of the certain
future is followed by the negation of the simple future with no contradiction.48.    a.      Ń       ni     kpɛ̂ŋl-a       kɛ̀      ń       ni      kpɛ̂ŋl hìn              bo.

"6.4.1 Deriving the Remote Past Implicature
When utterances that have a default past interpretation are marked with past tense ín, they are
often interpreted as being more distant in the past than the same utterance without ín. I argued in
6.3.3 that ín always marks past tense, even when it modifies default past expressions. If the
meaning of the utterance is already past, then adding the past tense ín would not change it. This
is not really a problem - redundancy is pervasive in language. However, if ín is not required to be
part of a sentence to contribute past tense, and it is not required to be part of a sentence to make
that sentence grammatical, then we have to ask what reason a speaker might have for adding this
particle to their utterance. If speakers are obeying the rules of conversation and not randomly
adding bits of phonology (which would be flouting the maxim of manner (Be clear and concise.)
and also perhaps the maxim of quantity (Don't say more than necessary.), then we have to
assume that ín is contributing something. The audience, if they assume the speaker is obeying the
rules of conversation, must also assume that ín is contributing something. Perhaps they say to
themselves, ""If she is marking something as past that is already past, it must really be past!"" And
thus we get a conversational implicature meaning of remote past.
       The remote past meaning is easy to cancel by context. For example, if ín is used in a
context that indicates that the speaker is expecting a response from the listener, then it does not
have a remote past meaning. The utterance in (76) is not incompatible with a remote past
reading, but in the given context, the speaker is wondering why the other person has asked if he's
already had his turn. In this case, ín does not indicate remoteness, but an indirect (or polite) way
of asking for a response.76.    Ń       ni      kɛl             ín.

2.3.4.3 Right-Edge Particles
Siamou has four main particles that occur at the right edge: a past tense particle ín (see chapter
6), a negation particle bo, a question particle a, and an emphatic particle na. In this section I
introduce them and examine their ordering and co-occurrence restrictions.",[90]
"       My goal in the next chapter is to establish the truth and felicity conditions for two Siamou
morphemes: the low tone suffix that I have been calling perfective aspect, and the -n suffix that I
hav been calling imperfective aspect, and to see how closely they match commonly accepted
truth and felicity conditions for perfectives and imperfectives. In a language, when a certain
phonological form regularly occurs in an utterance in conjunction with a consistent meaning or
set of meanings, we associate that form with the meaning(s) accompanying it. We like to give the
form some kind of name or label to identify it. Since similar sets of meanings occur in many
different languages, if the interpretation of a particular form in one language is similar to one that
occurs in one or more other languages, it is useful, for the sake of cross-linguistic comparison, to
give them the same name. Therefore, I will test whether or not the Siamou low tone suffix fits
the general definition for perfective aspect, and whether or not the Siamou -n suffix fits the
general definition for imperfective aspect. I will also determine how closely the meanings
associated with these forms match meanings associated with other forms with the same label in
other languages. If the Siamou forms have meanings similar to forms in other languages that are
called perfective or imperfective, it is sensible to give the Siamou forms the same name. This is
not to say they are equivalent, but they have some basic features in common.
       In order to reach the goal of establishing truth and felicity conditions, we need a way of
formalizing concepts so that a language can be examined systematically. This is the purpose of a
theoretical framework. It provides a vocabulary and allows us to define the terms perfective and
imperfective. Using these definitions, we can make predictions about the behaviour of these
forms, and then test these predictions by eliciting utterances, along with truth and felicity
judgments, from native speakers of a language. These tests are called diagnostics. Over the next
few pages, I discuss the theoretical framework that I adopt for my analysis of the Siamou verb
forms that correspond to the perfective and imperfective.
       Perfective and imperfective aspect both belong to the category of grammatical aspect.
However, their deployment is sensitive to the lexical properties of the verbs that they combine
                                                                                                  177
with. Therefore, in order to understand the perfective and imperfective, which are instances of
grammatical aspect, we need to consider how lexical aspect interacts with grammatical aspect. In
the following two subsections, I look first at two theories of grammatical aspect (4.2.1) and then
at lexical aspect (4.2.2).","[199, 200]"
"         In Section 5.5, I look at factatives in more detail. I argue that in Siamou, the factative
effect is not needed to explain the present stative interpretation of certain perfective-marked198
    For Siamou, the only information that appears to have been available was Prost (1964), which labels the
perfective and imperfective past and present respectively.

    I was not able to find negative data to show that a present interpretation is not acceptable for the examples in (40)
and that a past interpretation is not acceptable for the examples in (41).",[271]
"3.3.2.4 A (Possible) Argument from Auxiliation
Languages sometimes use auxiliary verbs to allow more than one kind of aspect in a clause. For
example, in English, the auxiliary have (+past participle) introduces perfect aspect and the
auxiliary be (+present participle) introduces progressive aspect. These aspects can stack, as
shown with the perfect progressive sentence in (64a). However, it is not possible for these
aspects to stack on the same verb, as evidenced by the utterance in (64b) which attempts to stack
the past and present participial forms of the verb think.64.      a.       He has been thinking.
         b.       * He is thinking-ed         If we only looked at (64b), we might conclude that English does not allow aspect
stacking either, but that is clearly not true (see Cinque 1999). It just does not allow stacking on
the same verb. There is some evidence that this may be the case in Siamou as well. The utterance
in (65) expresses both prospective aspect and imperfective aspect. In order to accommodate both,
the utterance uses the verb tɛŋn ('be/become') with prospective aspect morphology. Imperfective
aspect is marked with an imperfective nominal táaŋn that is the subject of the verb.",[167]
"Both of these sentences require the situation to be one in which your mom answered the phone,
but (8b) also requires both the speaker and the addressee to already believe that someone
answered the phone. This means that the question Did someone answer the phone? in (9) can be
answered by (9a), but not by (9b), even though both of them are true. Therefore these sentences
have similar truth conditions, but different felicity conditions (Matthewson 2004).",[198]
"5.4.1 Being a Stative Predicate: Lexical Statives Are Always Non-Verbal
The first strategy to express stativity is non-verbal stative predicates, such as the ones in (47-49).
This type of predicate is very common in Siamou. Some are formed with a post-positional phrase
(47), others with a copular particle ɔ (48),204 and still others with adjectives (49) or the noun shi
'knowledge/life (50).
         The phrases in (47g-i) express wanting. The thing that is wanted is in brackets.",[274]
"3.4.4 Aspectual Inflection and Negation: Siamou Diverges from Kru
There is a strategy for differentiating the perfective and imperfective in Kru which does not exist
in Siamou. All the Kru languages in Marchese's (1986) study for which she had the relevant data
had different negation strategies for the perfective and imperfective.",[177]
"
2.3.4 The Extended Verbal Projection
The tree in (58) below is a schema that represents my current understanding of Siamou's
extended verbal projection.
           At the bottom of the tree is the VP with the head (V) and the object (DP). Immediately
above that is the first aspect phrase, which contains perfective and imperfective aspect, and then
the second aspect phrase which contains stative, completive, prospective aspect 1 and
prospective aspect 2. (See 3.3 for arguments that support splitting the aspect phrase into two
levels.)
           The higher levels of the verbal projection contain a total of twelve functional particles:
one clause initial particle, seven pre-predicate particles, and four right-edge particles. No single
Siamou sentence contains all these particles. The pre-predicate particles are more restricted than
the right-edge particles. No more than two pre-predicate particles can occur in one sentence (see
2.3.4.2.8). The ordering of the particles in this tree is very tentative, and is based on co-
occurrence restrictions and ordering relations between them. The following paragraphs discuss
the rationale behind the tree in (58).",[71]

"
3.2.1.2 Siamou Is Consistently Head-Final
In Siamou, sentences always have surface SOV word order, as shown in (21) above. In fact, all
lexical heads in Siamou follow their complements. This is true for verb phrases (24a), noun
phrases (24b) and postpositional phrases (24c).9524.      a.       DP       V         [le]    [dì]

                                     eat food94
   For simpilicity, the diagram in (23) leaves out the aspectual inflection of the verb dì and uses only the bare verb
form di. Later in 3.2.1.4 I show the structure of the aspect phrase as well.
95
   I do not have any data to show the order of adjective phrases. It may be that Siamou does not have transitive
adjectives.",[144]
"       Koopman (1984) argues that this alternation is a verb-second effect similar to what
occurs in many Germanic languages. In this analysis, the underlying word order in Kru is SOV.
If an auxiliary occurs in the inflectional phrase (INFL), that position is filled, and the word order
remains S (Aux) OV. If there is no auxiliary, the verb raises to INFL resulting in a derived SVO
word order.
       In many Kru languages there is a contrast between auxiliaries and particles (Marchese
1986). (See 3.4.4.) Auxiliaries, as stated above, occur in clauses with an OV word order while
particles occur in clauses with a VO word order. For example, the auxiliary se (NEG.AUX) in (35)
changes the word order from SVO in (35a) to S (Aux) OV in (35b).",[150]
"1.3.1 The Grammatical Sketch
Chapter 2 provides background information about Siamou grammar and a brief description of
Siamou's phonology, including the inventory of consonants and vowels, syllable structure, and
tone. This chapter also surveys Siamou syntax, with information about basic word order (SOV),
and some detail about the nominal projection and the verbal projection. The discussion of the
nominal projection covers pronouns, modifiers, plurality, definiteness, possession and
nominalized verbs. The discussion of the verbal projection focuses on functional particles,

including a left-edge quotative particle, seven pre-predicate particles, and four right-edge
particles, concluding with a brief description of verb stems. The final portion of this chapter is a
short introduction to the Kru language family that shows how Siamou fits in. Siamou is an
outlier among the Kru languages both geographically and genetically. This chapter is important
because information about Siamou grammar is scarce and difficult to access. This is the first time
some of this information has been made available. It is also an important tool for understanding
this thesis. The remaining chapters focus on issues pertaining to tense and aspect. The
background provided in this chapter is intended to make the data in the following chapters more
comprehensible.","[33, 34]"

"This sentence can be said in reference to a person who was forbidden to eat for a day in order to
have a medical procedure done. After the procedure, she is allowed to eat, but she feels sick and
has no appetite. The first can has to do with permission, and the second can has to do with
physical ability. This tells us that even though on the surface it may seem that the Siamou phrase
À bè du-a has the same meaning as the English phrase He will climb, they are actually different
from each other in a very important way.
       To show how unrelated languages sometimes display uniformity, let us take an example
from the category of viewpoint aspect. In English, utterances like (9a) and (9b) have a very clear
contrast. The first one means that the rain started falling after I was done picking tomatoes, but
the second one means that the rain started falling while I was still picking. This is an aspectual
contrast.9.     a.      I picked tomatoes, and then it rained.

"2.4.2.1.4 Marchese (1983, 1986) on Kru
Marchese (1983) is the most comprehensive reference for Kru languages currently available. It
contains a description of the division of Kru languages into an Eastern branch and a Western
branch, with a few outliers, including Siamou. She describes canonical syllable structure and
phonological properties of Kru languages as well as properties of noun phrases and verb phrases,
and some syntactic constructions, including causatives, interrogatives and focus constructions.
        Marchese (1986) has given a preliminary description of tense and aspect in a large
sampling of Kru languages (Dida, Bété, Godié, Koyo, Neyo, Wobé, Nyabwa, Guéré, Krahn,
Grebo, Tepo, Bereby Kru, Cedepo, Nyabo, Borobo, Bassa, Dewoin, Klao, Bakwé, Sapo, Kuwaa,
Aïzi, and Seme (Siamou)). Kru languages express tense and aspect in the following ways:
suffixation, second position particles, auxiliaries, sentence initial markers, and periphrasis.
There is one category that has been described as a future tense, and four aspectual categories:
perfective, imperfective, progressive and perfect. While nearly every language in Marchese's
(1986) study has perfective, imperfective and progressive aspect, and future tense, the perfect
only exists in some languages. Also, Marchese (1986) argues that the perfective in nearly all
Kru languages is a certain kind of perfective known as a factative. The factative was described
by Welmers (1973) based on data from Igbo. It has a past interpretation with eventive verbs and
a present interpretation with stative verbs (Welmers 1973, Déchaine 1993). However, in Kru
languages the factative is different in that it has either a present interpretation with statives or it
                                                                                                      83
is neutral, having either a past interpretation or a present interpretation (Marchese 1986).
Throughout this thesis, I rely heavily on Marchese's (1986) description of tense and aspect in
Kru languages, making frequent comparisons and contrasts with the data I have collected for
Siamou.","[105, 106]"
"1.1.2 How Tense and Aspect Are Deployed in Siamou: The Empirical Stakes
Linguists are involved in a search for uniformity and diversity across languages. To understand
how language works, it is important to know what languages have in common, and also in what
ways they are different. Our knowledge of tense and aspect is gathered from looking at a variety                                                                                                      2
of languages. The more languages are studied, the more we can refine and develop this
knowledge. This thesis is about how tense and aspect works in Siamou: how it is like other
languages (uniformity) and how it is different (diversity).
         As an example of a way in which languages are diverse, here is a basic contrast between
two unrelated languages: English and Siamou. In English, sentences must be marked for tense,
but not aspect. This means that you can say (4a) with past tense ate, but not (4b) with unmarked
eat. Although there is no aspect marking in (4a), it is still grammatical.4.       a.       Yesterday I ate breakfast.
         b.1      * Yesterday I eat breakfast.","[24, 25]"
"
The VP is the lexical layer, which includes the verb. The IP is a functional layer and contains
things like tense, aspect, and agreement. The CP is a higher level functional head that includes
complementizers, relative pronouns, question markers as well as topicalized and focused
elements of a sentence (Rizzi 1997).
       Various authors have proposed that each of these levels (CP, IP, and VP), which
Grohmann (2003) calls prolific domains, can be more complex than just one phrase. For
example, Larson (1988) proposed that the VP be split into various levels to account for di-
transitive verbs, Pollock (1989) proposed that the IP is made of up a tense phrase, a negation
                                                                                                  135
phrase, and an agreement phrase,97 and Rizzi (1997) proposed that the CP is made up of a force
phrase, a topic phrase, a focus phrase and a finiteness phrase.
         Then, to take it one step further, a more fine-grained structure has been proposed for the
aspect phrase, a sub-part of the IP, e.g., Tenny (2000).) Aspect is commonly taken to be made up
of two main parts: lexical aspect and grammatical aspect (Smith 1997). Lexical aspect is a
property of predicates, a part of the VP. Grammatical aspect is part of the IP.
         Liao (2005) proposes that in addition to the split between lexical and grammatical
aspect, grammatical aspect can be split into two kinds, which he calls viewpoint aspect and
temporal aspect. Viewpoint aspect includes perfective, imperfective, progressive and habitual
aspects. Temporal aspect includes perfect and prospective aspects (Table 3.18).98Table 3.18 Three Levels of Aspect99
Type of Aspect     Includes
Lexical Aspect     stative, accomplishment, achievement, activity
Viewpoint Aspect perfective, imperfective, progressive, habitual
Temporal Aspect perfect, prospective         This split reflects an intuition that the perfect and prospective are somehow different than
perfective and imperfective (Comrie 1976). Descriptively, temporal aspect has to do with
situations in which the reference time and the event time do not overlap while viewpoint aspect
has to do with situations in which the reference time and the event time do overlap. See chapter
4, especially 4.2-4.3, for more information about this.
         The key point of this discussion is that there is evidence from the literature for a more
fine-grained structure of the aspect phrase. Therefore, the structure proposed for Siamou in (55),
with the perfective and imperfective in a lower aspectual phrase than the other aspects, is not in
any way unusual. In Siamou, there are two morphological properties of the perfective and
imperfective that distinguish them from the other aspects, and are consistent with the
independently motivated structure in (55). This is discussed in 3.3.2.","[157, 158]"
"       The examples above can all be accounted for if we assume that -a encodes distant
prospective aspect while -bɛ̂ encodes near prospective aspect. Distant prospective aspect and
near prospective aspect can be diagrammed as in (58).58.    a.      Distant prospective aspect      R. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . E
       b.      Near prospective aspect         R. . . . ENearness does not have to be interpreted as temporal nearness (or ((57) would be infelicitous). It
can be interpreted as certainty (nearer to reality), as in (52b) and (53b), or even as physical
nearness, as in (54b).
       With the certain future, it often seems as though the events leading up to the event have
already been set in motion (see Bybee and Dahl (1989)). The certainty of the certain future can
be derived quite naturally from the process already in motion. If the sequence of events leading
up to an outcome has already begun, it is much more likely the outcome will be realized. The
certain future can be used when the process has actually already begun, such as in (53b) when
the rock is already on its way to falling, even if you are not foolish enough to sit on it, or in (54b)
when the speaker has already arrived at the market, ready to buy corn, or in (56a) when
presumably the rain clouds have already started to form. It can also be used when the sequence
of events is not as clear. For example, someone's decision to do something can be a part of the                                                                                                   360
process. Thus (52c) can be uttered in the context of planning a party, but it is not felicitous as an
offer because the speaker is saying that the sequence of events leading up to their making of the
food has already begun, which allows no room for negotiation.
       Utterances with past reference times can also refer to events already in motion. For
example, in (59), the utterance is infelicitous because the speaker is already beginning the
process of spreading a mat, which is not possible if there is no mat.59.    #Ń     bè      kpàr búr-bɛ̀,          kɛ̀      kpàr tɛ̀n-nèn      bo.
