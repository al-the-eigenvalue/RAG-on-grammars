"     Although wala logically connects two disjunct clauses, in (292) it functions
indirectly as a kind of polar interrogative marker. German .... oder? '..., or?' following
an affirmative sentence has a similar polar interrogative function.
176 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization     The morpheme rjga! can be used in isolation to mean 'yes!'. Note that rjga
elsewhere functions as the 3SgF pronoun, and as the SFoc (subject-focus) morpheme,
but the etymological connection of the 'yes!' interjection to these grammatical
morphemes is unclear. The form kalaa! means 'no!', again as an isolation form.
     However, rjga! and kalaa! are not the preferred responses to polar questions.
Instead, wherever possible, the response to a yes-no question is a truncated echo clause
consisting of a pronominal subject and a nonzero MAN morpheme, the remainder of
the clause being omitted. (293a) shows positive and negative responses to a question
in imperfective aspect, while (293b) shows a negative reply to a question in the
unmarked perfective aspect.(293)    a.   Q: no-o              dira        suba         wala ?
                 2SgS-Impf         travel      tomorrow    or?
                 'Will you(Sg) travel tomorrow?'

9.3.4 Equivalents of negative polarity itemsKCh does not appear to have any lexical items that are used exclusively as negative
polarity items in the fashion of English (not) any, (not) ever, (not) a red cent, etc. (but
cf. §5.4.7). The forms that can be used to translate such English expressions are also
used in ordinary positive contexts. The main ones are listed in (475).(475)         form      gloss (positive)     gloss (negative contexts')
              foo       One, a(n)'           '(not) any, non' [preceding section]
              kul       'all, every, each'   '(not) any, none' [preceding section]
              abada     'always' [rare]      '(not) ever, never, absolutely not'
              far!      'indeed!'            '(not) at all!'
              wala...   'even ...; or ...'   '(not) even ...""",[274]
"     It is possible to add the Emph particle yaa to such an answer, hence ay goo yaa
'Yes I will.'
     The one case where such a truncated answer is not possible is a positive answer to
a perfective aspect question, since here the MAN slot is vacant, both positive polarity
and perfective aspect being unmarked. In this case, the only possibility is rjga! 'yes!'.
     It follows that kalaa!, the corresponding 'no!' interjection, is not obligatory as an
answer to any yes-no question, and is not particularly common in this function.
However, kalaa! can also be used to contradict or challenge an assertion by an
interlocutor.
     In (293a), note that Impf goo and its negation sii have their full forms, in contrast
to ο - go and si when followed by an overt VP. These same full forms are also used as
locational quasi-verbs meaning 'be (present)' and 'not be (present), be absent' (§7.1.2).",[192]
"
9.6.5 Subjunctive clauses under the scope of a distant negativeSimple negative clauses ('she didn't see him,' Ί am not sick') are expressed in the
unmarked indicative mood. That is, the negative morpheme itself is the only
indication of the truth-value status of the underlying (positive) proposition. In this
respect, KCh resembles English and other western European languages, and diverges
from the pattern seen in some (e.g. Australian) languages where ordinary negation is
marked by the combination of a negative morpheme and an irrealis mood form ('it
wasn't that she see-Irrealis him,' 'It's not that I be-Irrealis sick').
     However, there are indications that even in KCh, clauses under the scope of a
negation have latent tendencies to take subjunctive rather than indicative form. In other
words, while the KCh subjunctive is predominantly a future-oriented deontic modal
(desiderative, obligational, purposive), it has a second function, admittedly less
conspicuous, as an irrealis (nonactualized) epistemic modal.
     We got a hint of this in the use of subjunctive complements after bilaa 'without'
(§9.6.4). Since 'without' has a built-in negative semantic component, perhaps this
(weak) negation rather than deontic modality is responsible for the subjunctive mood.(562)        yee         yenaa gi           nin i     na bey ka kaa ta

7.2 Mood-aspect-negation (MAN)
The categories distinguished by the MAN morphemes that intervene between subject
NP and the verb are those in (250). The unmarked categories are expressed by the
absence of a MAN morpheme.

perfective, or positive in interlinear glosses.
     Aside from the three basic binary oppositions in (250), there are some special
forms for presentative imperfectives (§7.2.3), future tense (§7.2.5), and progressives
(§7.2.6).","[170, 171]"

9.3.2 Clause-internal and higher-level (metalinguistic) negationOrdinary (clause-internal) negation is expressed primarily by the morphemes in (464).(464)          form   gloss       comments               positive counterpart

sii and its positive counterpart goo, see §7.1.2 and §8.2.1.
     Some lexical stems with one kind or another of built-in negative sense, though
not grammatically negative, are given in (465).(465)         form         gloss                  comments
              jen          'fail (to ...)'        serial verb plus infinitival VP

               morjgo      'fail (at), be unable' intr. or tr. verb, or serial verb
              yaada        'be worthless, free' verb or adjective    jen is useful in that it can itself be preceded by Inf[initive] ka in an infinitival
VP, where the preverbal MAN morphemes in (464) are not allowed. Likewise, the
(etymologically related) compound final jeηey is the nearest approximation of
negation within a NP.
     In addition to clause-internal negation, there is a more complex construction that
can be used with either a NP (466c) or a clause in its scope. The construction begins
with a na oi ... 'it is not ...' When the complement is a clause, the 'that ...'
conjunction kaa is occasionally used (466a), though more often omitted (466b). This
higher-level construction can be used for ""metalinguistic"" negation, e.g., to correct a
phrase or sentence previously uttered by the current speaker (self-correction) or by
someone else. As we will see, a higher-level negation may result in more transparent
scope relationships vis- -vis a quantifier. For now, note the split-level negation in
(466b).(466)    a.   a        na      £i kaa ay         guna har    foo
              3SgS Neg be that ISgS see man one

              'It's not a dog.'","[270, 271]"
"      Disjunctive yes-no questions with wala Or' often take unreduced form, ba occurs
after the first of the disjunct clauses (758a). (758b) shows wala as a tag question in
yes-no contexts where the second disjunct clause (the positive-negative inverse of the
first clause) is omitted.(758)    a.   woo di na mor-ciino woo di^ ο                gay           ba ?
              Dem Def with now            Dem Def Impf be-long-time yes-no?

              or     Dem Def with now              3SgS ImpfNeg be-long-time?
              'From that (prosperous time) to now, has that been a long time? Or from
               that time to now, it has not been a long time?

              2P1S      come-with knife          small or?
              'You brought the little knife, didn't you?' (='Did you bring the little
               knife?')     Clause-initial particle yala ~ yara is occasionally used instead of wala in simple
or embedded yes-no questions. While wala also means Or' and is basically a
disjunction, yala - yara elsewhere has modal values ranging from desiderative (§9.6.4)
to expectation, cf. (819) in §9.6.5, below.
     Truncated echoic replies to yes-no interrogatives, of the form subject pronoun
plus positive go or negative si, occur in DjCh but less systematically than in KCh.
Alternatives are a simple 'yes!' ( h ! with rising pitch on the second syllable) or 'no!'
(δ'δ! with falling pitch) interjection, or a syntactically complete sentence including a
verb, as in (759).",[421]
"
9.6 Subjunctive complementsThe subjunctive mood is expressed by a preverbal morpheme ma, which directly
follows a subject NP. For the irregular 2SgSubj ma replacing the rare fuller sequence
?#/H ma, and the optional irregular ISgSubj ye alongside regular ay ma, see §7.2.4.
The mood marker is always ma after other pronouns and after all full NPs. The
subjunctive may be directly negated, with si following ma. The subjunctive is
therefore a full-fledged, finite clause, lacking only aspectual marking.
     In the following sections we describe in greater detail the syntactic and semantic
contexts in which subjunctive clauses occur. We distinguish five construction types
involving an identifiable ""subjunctive trigger"" which calls for this type of clause:
specific matrix-clause verbs like 'want' (§9.6.1); obligational bara (§9.6.2); jussive
reported speech (§9.6.3); certain complementizers (§9.6.4); a distant negative marker
(§9.6.5). In §9.6.6 we discuss cases where there is no (overt) subjunctive trigger.
Finally, in §9.6.7 we consider syntactic issues that cut across these types of cases,
such as multiple subjunctive clauses associated with a single subjunctive trigger.
     There are two basic semantic clusters here. The most obvious one is deontic
modality (desiderative, obligational, purposive), which is oriented toward possible
future action. A less conspicuous one involves epistemic modality, specifically, the
suspension of truth-value assertion of a clause under the scope of negation. Both the
290 9 Sentence-level syntax and semanticsdeontic and the epistemic uses of the subjunctive can be pre-empted by the presence of
stronger modal elements. The deontic use of the subjunctive is pre-empted by an overt
imperative, but this still leaves plenty of deontic ""space"" for the subjunctive to appear
in. On the other hand, the epistemic uses of the subjunctive are mainly associated with
negation, but an overt negative within the clause pre-empts the subjunctive. As a
result, we find an epistemic subjunctive clause most often in syntactic contexts
involving a distanced negation that takes scope over, but is not part of, the
subjunctive clause (§9.6.5). There are, however, some cases of non-negative epistemic
subjunctives (§9.7.8).","[305, 306]"

9.1.2 Double-object constructions ('give', 'show')noo 'give' most often has a canonical direct object plus dative construction even when
the indirect object is a first or second person pronoun, as in (795).(795)   a. yo-o           noo ga          [ni      see]
           3PlS-Impf      give 3SgO [2Sg          Dat]

hay a (foo) si ηεε 'there is nothing here.' In this instance, the polarity item precedes
the negative (si 'not be').","[434, 435]"
"     The composite construction X ci Υ nono occurs chiefly in the negative form X na
ci Υ nono, which functions as the usual negative counterpart of Υ nono, with the
emphasis on identification rather than description. Although the relevant part of (231)
is positive, it is in a yes-no question, which may have favored the longer construction.
A typical negative example is (232).

              'It isn't a human.'","[162, 163]"
"      If the second disjunct in an embedded polar interrogative is simply the negation of
the first, as in (506), one of them may be be omitted, the wala 'whether' on the overt
disjunct implying the second. In this case, the overt clause may be either the negative
or the positive version. The negative version is actually preferred, as in (507), the
literal translation of which is awkward in English.(507)         ay      si      bey wala [ni          si    bey ga]
              ISgS ImpfNeg know or          [2SgS ImpfNeg know 3SgO]
              Ί don't know whether you don't know him.'",[289]
"      Here the negative ordinarily has narrow scope regardless of the syntactic role
(subject or nonsubject) of the quantified NP; (469a) can be paraphrased as 'for all x, we
could not see x' rather than 'It is not the case that we could see everyone.'
      Comparing the behavior of foo and kul, the generalization is that their
combinations with a negation are interpreted in the manner which produces the
strongest assertion (that with the most precise truth conditions). In the case of foo
One', the strongest reading is the one with wide-scope negation ('not [... one ...]'),
but in that of kul 'all' the strongest reading is the one with narrow-scope negation ('all
[... not...]'). The result is that there is no truth-conditional difference between foo and
kul in negative contexts. One factor favoring kul is that, unlike foo, it can be freely
used with mass (as well as count) NPs, as in (469c). Replacing kul with foo here
would be awkward, though perhaps not impossible, cf. (467c).
      The truth-conditionally weaker interpretations of Neg plus kul 'all' can be elicited
provided the context is favorable, as in (470). The preceding material makes it clear
that i-kul na bun means 'they did not all die' (i.e., 'it is not true that, for all χ, χ
died'), not 'none of them died' (i.e., 'for all χ, χ did not die').(470)         h ysi hinja     di bun, a-foo            cindi,

7.3 ImperativesWith kaa 'come' the forms are: singular positive kaa! 'come!', singular negative ma
si kaa! 'don't come!', plural positive wo kaa!, plural negative wo ma si kaa!. The
only difference vis- -vis KCh is that the plural negative uses the 2PlImpera wo rather
than the full 2P1S form wor, as sometimes in other subjunctive contexts.
                                                                    Djenne Chiini   4038.1.1 Nonsubject focus constructionsWhereas nonsubject focalized constituents in KCh are always fronted, in DjCh they
may be fronted or may remain in place (in situ). The in situ pattern seems dominant in
the basilect. When a semantically focused constituent such as a WH-interrogative
remains in situ, it may lack explicit DF marking (752a-b). While WH-interrogatives
are presumptively focalized, in sentences with ordinary (noninterrogative) NPs as
postverbal constituents there may be no way to determine whether one of these
constituents is ""focalized,"" so the concept of grammatical idealization is dubiously
applicable to DjCh. However, Emph yaa is often added to a postverbal NP in
focalizing function, as with the WH-interrogative in (752c).(752)    a.   n      kar    mey?
              2SgS hit      who?

"
7.3 ImperativesSpecial Impera[tive] forms are limited to second person subject and occur in the
positive only. Expressions used as negative imperatives are identical to negated
subjunctive clauses. It is possible to distinguish the negative-imperative usage from
other subjunctive uses on the grounds that negative imperatives require no external
subjunctive trigger.
     There is no aspect marking in imperatives; Impf o is not allowed. The forms are
shown in (263), with indicative counterparts (perfective aspect) provided for
comparison.

"     Of the two 'except' particles in KCh, bara is much more common than kala in
Timbuktu (§5.9.9). Both particles also have other functions (or homophones); for
bara see §7.1.3 (existential quasi- verb), §9.5.9 (indicative 'since' complementizer),
and §9.6.2 (impersonal obligational with subjunctive); for kala see §9.5.8 (rare
indicative 'that' complementizer).
     In the 'except X' construction that concerns us here, bara or kala precedes the
attached constituent. Often they identify a positive exception to a preceding negative
proposition; see the following section. However, bara or kala can also identify an
exception to a positive proposition, as in (403).(403)        i-kul         kaa      [bara      A]

     It is clear that ο ~ go is basically an imperfective marker, and that ma is a
subjunctive modal. The distribution of the negatives si and na makes precise analysis
difficult. On the one hand, indicative perfective negative na should be a simple Neg
morpheme, since indicative and perfective are zero categories. This would imply that
indicative imperfective negative si is the surface expression of two marked categories,
Impf plus Neg (also interpreted as indicative due to the absence of subjunctive
marking). This in turn would lead us to expect that the negative marker used with
Subju ma would be the categorially simpler Neg na rather than the more complex
ImpfNeg si, but in fact we get si in the negative subjunctive ma si. To avoid arbitrary
reductionism, I conservatively label 173 as ""Neg."" In the indicative, I label si as
""ImpfNeg,"" but in the combination ma si (where aspect is neutralized) I label si
simply as ""Neg.""
     In KCh (particularly in Timbuktu), the variant ο is vastly more common than the
other variant go. Irregular contractions of ο with a word-final vowel in the preceding
(subject) NP or pronoun are discussed in §3.7.1.
156 7 VP structure     As noted in §7.1.2 and §8.2.1, ο - go and si are arguably identical to the
locational quasi-verbs 500 (positive) and sii (negative).
     The 2Sg pronoun, elsewhere ni, shows some irregularities. The 2SgS (perfective)
Neg sequence is ma na instead of #ni na. The 2Sg ma allomorph is also possibly
present in 2SgSSubju ma (if reduced from #ma ma) and is clearly present in 2SgDat
mana- mane. See §3.8.2 for discussion.
    The ISg pronoun, usually ay, has an optional ISgSSubju variant ye alongside
regular ay ma, see §3.8.1.","[171, 172]"
"    The KCh system of possessive predications is quite different from that of KS and
other Songhay languages to the east.
7.1.5 haya foo '(do) anything' and other apparent verbless predicatesThere is one construction where an NP with indefinite or interrogative reference
appears to be used as a verb. We first consider haya foo One thing', which can be
used as a negative polarity NP '(not) ... anything' (§9.3.4). However, it appears to
function as a verb in (247a-b).(247)    a.   woo       ci ferey       kaa      si

"     Other such expressions are combinations of a noun with foo or kul, like boro foo
'someone, anyone, no-one' (475a) and haya foo 'something, anything, nothing'
(475b); we may add noqgu foo 'somewhere', saa foo 'some time', ban foo 'some
day', etc. For haya foo as a verb '(do) anything', see §7.1.5.
     In (476a), abada (<Ar. 'never') is an autonomous adverbial particle which is far
more common in negative than positive contexts, far! can be thought of as a default
intensifying interjection (§9.2), and is used both in positive ('..., period!') and
negative ('[not]..., at all!') sentences, as in (476b-c).

             together, which screech, indeed!'","[274, 275]"
"      A more literal translation is 'it's the truth, if it is not (the case that) [it's the
season which be ruined],1 cf. (285) in §8.5.3. (564) shares with (563) the use of a
higher-level negation and the subject-focus construction in the lower clause, and there
are additional textual examples of exactly this type.
      What (562-64) seem to have in common is that a negative operator has semantic
scope over a clause X, but does not appear directly in the normal (preverbal) position
within X itself. Either X is an elaboration or paraphrase of a preceding negated
proposition (minus the Neg marker), or X is negated by a higher-level negation and
itself has a focalized subject NP intervening between this negation and its own VP.
      I have no textual examples where non-subject focus, as opposed to subject focus
as in (563-64), combines with higher-level negation to force a shift to subjunctive
mood. For example, (481) in §9.3.5, above, is 'it is not [[only once] [focus] (that) I
drank alcohol]' with indicative mood.",[315]
"
9.3.5 Negation, adverbiale ('again', 'first'), and DF morpheme Only'jinaa 'first, at first, for the time being' was introduced in §9.3.1, with examples in
positive contexts. It associates an eventuality whose time interval precedes that of
another eventuality, or whose time interval is not seen as permanent.
     The combination of jinaa with a preceding negative results in the sense 'not yet*.
A sentence of the general type 'he has not eaten yet' can be paraphrased (however
awkwardly) as 'for now [it is not the case that [he has eaten]],' but not as 'it is not the
case that [he ate first],' which would require a higher-level negation. This shows that
jinaa rather than the negation has wide scope in single-clause combinations. Examples
in (477).(477)    a. a      na      hantum jinaa
            3SgS Neg write           at-first

260 9 Sentence-level syntax and semantics    For ka jinaa ... as serial verb, see §9.7.5.
    koyne 'again, further' was likewise introduced in §9.3.1 with positive examples
Combining this with a negation gives the sense 'not again, no longer, no more, not
any more' in the great majority of cases. A sentence of the type 'he no longer danced'
can be paraphrased as 'it is not the case that [he danced further]' but not as 'again [it is
not the case that [he danced]].' Therefore in this case the negation has wide scope.
Examples in (478).(478)    a.   IM      si       yee       koyne
              2SgS ImpfNeg return again

"     Since bilaa 'without' is intrinsically negative, it is reasonable to connect this use
of the subjunctive with those described in the following section.
     An alternative way of expressing 'X, without Y' where X and Υ are clauses, is by
simple juxtaposition of X with the negative form of Υ (§9.5.3).",[314]
"     See also (247b) in §7.1.5, above, bara can also be used as a clause-initial
'because ..."" particle (§9.5.9), and in examples like (407a) one could possibly construe
bara in this way. kala, for its part, is sometimes used as a 'that' complementizer
(§9.5.8). Close attention to context is required in analysing textual occurrences of
bara and kala.
     In (407b-c), English would normally omit the repeated subject NP and the tense
inflection in the exception clause, which would therefore be syntactically a VP ('She
does nothing except sleep'). In KCh, complete clauses including subject NPs are
required.
     Although the construction with bara or kala is quite productive, we also find
textual examples with nda^ a na ci... 'if it (he, she) is not ...' expressing exceptions
to negative clauses. In this case, the exception clause may precede (408a) or follow
(408b) the main negative clause.(408)    a. nda_^ a          na     ci sanda alwakati addaruura-nte yo

'rice'.
     moo is a typical DF morpheme which follows the constituent over which it has
primary scope. This constituent may be an NP (full NP or pronoun) or adverbial. In
the case of a PP, moo attaches to the NP and therefore precedes the postposition, as in
(409).(409)        nda aSsaraa         kaa hay kaa a-a              dam-di

"     A freer English translation: '... whether (or not) you know him.'
     Normally, two or more disjuncts linked by wala must be of the same syntactic
and semantic types (e.g., both are clauses, or both are NPs). However, the same kinds
of nominal catch-all expressions used to end an NP disjunction (§5.11.5) may be used
in the same function with clausal disjunctions, especially in a negative context, as in
(508).(508)         a        na ci      a-a         goro ka hantum
              3SgS Neg be 3SgS-Impf sit               Inf write
              wala [woo         di      taka]
              or       [Dem     Def kind]
              'It isn't as though he sits and writes, or something like that.'
274 9 Sentence-level syntax and semantics     One could argue, though, that this represents '... or HE DOES something like
that,' with some phonologically unrealized material.
     The sequence 'either ... , or ...' can also be expressed asymmetrically, with
another particle maa (<Ar. 'immaa 'either ... , or ...') at the beginning of the first
conjunct and wala at the beginning of the second, as in (509).(509)        maa a-a                fan    wala a-a             kur wala—
             either 3SgS-Impf farm or              3SgS-Impf herd or—
             'Either he toils (in the fields), or he herds (animals), or—'    For wala as a polar interrogative marker (yes-no), see §8.2.1.","[289, 290]"
"     As in English, ""negative raising"" is common with 'want'. In (544a) and (546c),
the negation arguably belongs in the subjunctive clause (Ί want that it not be torn'),
but surfaces on the matrix verb (Ί don't want that it be torn'). However, with other
matrix verbs, negation works differently in matrix and subjunctive clauses, as in
(547a-b).(547)     a.   a      na      yedda        [ay        ma    kaa]
               3SgS Neg consent [ISgS                 Subju come]
               'She did not consent that I come.'
          b.   a      yedda      [ay       ma         si  kaa]
               3SgS consent [ISgS Subju               Neg come]
               'She consented that I not come.'",[308]
"     For wala in the sense 'even' (in positive or negative clause), see §8.5.9.",[275]
"     With a mass noun like 'wind' in (468a), it is clear that the negation again has
wide scope ('it is not the case that there was some wind'). With a countable noun like
bor(o) 'person* in (468b), on the other hand, we can construe it generically, in which
case there is no clear truth-conditional difference between wide-scope negation ('for no
representative χ is it the case that χ could control it') and narrow-scope negation ('for a
representative χ, χ could not control it'). However, even such cases are at least
compatible with a wide-scope reading.
     The other high-frequency quantifier in negative sentences is kul 'all, every, each*.
Some examples are in (469).(469)    a.   yer    na hin_^ ka       guna [boro kul]

9.7.6 Quantifying and negative serial verbsHere we are concerned with serial verbs listed in (583d) in §9.7.2, above, that specify
the extent (positive or negative) to which the eventuality in question was realized.
     As a simple verb, hlsa can mean 'fix, prepare, cook (food), make, make well'.
Sometimes it simply denotes production, sometimes it stresses the thoroughness or
high quality of the work of production or repair. As a serial verb, the general sense is
'VP very much, VP a lot'. It is common with verbs denoting gradient adjectival
qualities, as in (595a), but it also occurs with other kinds of VP denoting measurable
activities, as in (595b).(595)    a.   a        tiisa     [ka     sendu]
              3SgS do-very [Inf          be-difficult]
              'It (=food) has become very expensive.'
         b.   woo ci baana kaa yer         tiisa      [ka gey-nda—,  a    oinne]
              Dem be rain Rel 1 PIS do-very [Inf endure-with—, 3Sg peer]
              'This was a rain, which we have gone a very long time without the
               likes of it.'",[329]
"    For wala with following clause in the similar sense 'even if ...', see end of
§9.5.1.
     wala can be used with a following VP after a negation. Depending on the speaker,
the VP is either simple (in which case wala is analysed as a simple particle inserted
between MAN marking and VP), or has the form of an infinitival VP (in which case
wala appears to function as a serial verb). The two constructions are seen in (424a-b).

8.6 Co-occurrence of major discourse-functional categoriesThe DF categories discussed in this chapter are in many cases very productive, to the
point where multiple DF marking may occur in a sentence or even on a single
constituent.
     There is no syntactic or logical problem in having more than one Emph
constituent, or in having multiple topics. However, focus marking in the sense of
§8.1.1-2 is expressed by a clause-level syntactic operation (fronting, plus insertion of
an SFoc or Foe particle between the fronted constituent and the rest of the core
sentence), so there can only be one focalized constituent per clause in this sense. In
examples like (307c) in §8.2.3, above, one could argue that there are two (functional)
foci, but only one constituent is syntactically marked as focus.","[252, 253]"

                                   Introduction
1.1 Generalities about SonghaySonghay is often described loosely as a ""language,"" but in fact it is a large complex of
varieties, some of which are quite clearly distinct languages. Languages of the
Songhay family are linguistically dominant in northeastern Mali along the Niger
River, and others of the family occupy much of the Republic of Niger (""Kaado"" and
""Zarma""). Additional varieties are spoken in Bonin, and perhaps still residually in the
Dori area of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta). Some ""nomadic"" or ""northern""
Songhay languages, not yet well studied, are spoken by small beduin groups in far
northern Niger, with one offshoot each extending into Mali ('Tadaksahak"" near
Menaka) and in southwestern Algeria (""Korandje"" in the Tabelbala oasis). The major
work on the internal genetic classification of Songhay varieties is that of Nicola'i
(1981), who puts considerable emphasis on sound changes and phonological typology.
     My work on Songhay has focused to date on the four main varieties spoken in
Mali. The following sets of designations are partially interchangeable. One set
consists of transcriptions of the native terms; the second is simply the name (in
English or French) of the respective major town; the third is the cardinal-direction
system developed by Nicola'i.        native term         major city or town    NicolaTs term

         humburi senn-i     Hombori               central Songhay (S. central)     For Gao, koroboro senn-i co-occurs with other variants such as koyra senn-i and
koyra senn-e.
     The nouns ciini and senn-i ~ senn-i (with variant senn-e ~ senn-e) are noncognate,
though both mean 'speech, speaking, language', cf. verbs cii (<*ciin) and selaq -
seien. In the cases of Djenne and Hombori, both of which are (in effect) Songhay
enclaves rather than parts of extended Songhay-speaking regions, the first term of the
compound is simply the name of the town. Timbuktu and Gao, on the other hand, are
merely the largest cities in extended Songhay-speaking regions, and the terms for these
varieties are more general: koyra-ciini 'town language' and koroboro-senn-i
(contraction of koyra-boro senn-i 'town-person language') distinguish the sedentary
Songhays from the nomadic Arabs and Tuaregs. The Songhay are also sometimes
called 'river people' (Timbuktu isa-boro), but no related expression for their language
is in common use.
     For the native sense of sonoy, see beginning of §1.2.
     We will use the informal transcription ""Koyra Chiini"" to denote the unbroken
koyra ciini complex of dialects in the region along and near the Niger River beginning
2   1 Introduction with Timbuktu. This includes the towns of Dire"", Tonka, Goundam, and Niafunke
 going upriver (west) from Timbuktu. There is a thinly populated northern extension in
 Araouane, on the caravan route from Timbuktu to Taoudenni. There is a relatively
 sharp linguistic break between Koyra Chiini and Koroboro Senni (the ""Gao"" variety)
just east of Timbuktu. Koroboro Senni is the traditional language even of Gourma
 Rharous and Bamba, the first important towns on the Niger River going east from
Timbuktu.
      Most of my Koyra Chiini data are from Timbuktu itself. I have a corpus of some
 six hours of transcribed recordings, mostly dyadic (interviews, conversations, or
 narratives with an interactive listener). I have supplemented this data base with elicited
material obtained chiefly in the final field sessions (1996-97).
      I also have some transcribed recordings from Niafunke"" and Goundam, which can
 serve as representatives of the larger complex of ""upriver"" dialects (""upriver"" from the
perspective of Timbuktu). I also spent about a week in this area in 1996 to clear up
 some problems in the analysis of these tapes and to do some follow-up elicitation and
ethnobiological vocabulary elicitation and specimen collection. A summary of
observable differences between the upriver dialects and the Timbuktu dialect is given in
the short Appendix 1. In the much larger Appendix 2, I describe the distinctive and
 geographically separated variety of Djenno, which I refer to as ""Djenne Chiini"" (for
jenne ciini, literally ""Djenn6 language""). Abbreviations for the Malian Songhay
 languages and varieties used in this grammar are KCh (Koyra Chiini, the present
object of study), DjCh (Djenne Chiini), KS (Koroboro Senni of Gao, etc.), and HS
 (Humburi Senni of Hombori). Names of other Songhay languages are not abbreviated.
      The wider genetic affiliation of Songhay is controversial. It is one of the few
African languages for which Joseph Greenberg (1966) did not make a confident
assignment to a large genetic stock, though he suggested Nilo-Saharan as a possible
connection. Nicolai (1984, 1990) has suggested a possible Creole origin in which
Tamashek (Tuareg) played a major lexifying role, but this has not won wide
acceptance. It might be advisable to defer reconsideration of the wider affiliation of the
 Songhay complex until we have better descriptions of the several varieties within the
complex and can thus do serious reconstruction of Proto-Songhay.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"

7.1.1 Quasi-verbs ci (equational) and nono (identificational)The unnegated equational-quasi verb is pronounced ci or si, the latter being common in
the local basilect. In general, each speaker uses one variant or the other consistently.
Care must be taken to distinguish this si (which always precedes a NP) from ImpfNeg
si (which always directly precedes a verb), and from negative locational si (next
section). As in KCh, the quasi-verb normally occurs in unmarked (perfective) aspect
(742a) and is therefore negated by na (742). In this combination the quasi-verb is
pronounced ti (742b).(742)    a.   na ni         si     boro    kaa...
              if    2SgS be person Rel ...
              'if you are a person who ...'
         b.   ay      na        ti      yenge-koso
              ISgS Neg          be      brawler
              Ί am not a trouble-maker (habitual fighter).'
400 Appendix 27.1.2 Locational quasi- verbs go, siThe locational quasi-verbs, positive go and negative si, seem to have about the same
syntax as do KCh 500 and sii. However, in DjCh I hear the vowels as short.
Moreover, go is sometimes reduced to ο when followed by a locational phrase, as in
(743). KCh always has goo in this context.(743)         mey ijga^      ο         ηεε
              who? S Foe be            here
              'Who is here?'     go may also disappear entirely after a pronoun (if a locational expression follows),
as in wor ηεε 'you(Pl) are here' in ex. (744b) of §9.5.6. Disappearance is most
common after ISgS pronoun ay, as in (744). Recall that Impf go is also often omitted
after this pronoun.(744)         ay        _        morayda      norjgu        di kama
              ISgS      _        now place Def              Rel
              'the place (in) which I am now'     Because of these facts, the equation of locational go ~ ο and si with Impf go - ο
and ImpfNeg si is even better justified in DjCh than in KCh.","[415, 416]"

5.4.7 Currency and time of dayThe local currency is the CFA franc, which is held at a fixed exchange rate to the
French franc (FF) and is shared with the other Francophone West African countries
                                               5.4 Numerals and other quantifiers      95 (except Mauritania). The rate was 50 CFA = 1 FF for many years until 1994, when it
 was abruptly devalued to 100 CFA = 1 FF. In the early years of Malian independence,
 there was a Malian franc (franc malien).
      However, currency is normally calculated in terms of the 'riyal' (<Spanish real, via
 Arabic). The usual KCh pronunciation is allaara; an older form alliyaara is found in
 other Songhay dialects and points to an Arabic prototype such as *ar-riyaal(a) via
 metathesis of r and 1.
      The riyal was a colonial-era coin of high value. Terms for smaller colonial-era
 coins like koboro are now used chiefly in 'red cent' negative polarity usage ('he didn't
 give me even a koboro'). As the colonial currency was displaced first by the franc
 malien and then by the CFA franc, the vernacular term allaara was equated with
 multiples of these new official units, and currency continues to be calculated in riyals
 in the native languages (though not in local French). One riyal is equivalent to 5 CFA
 francs. Therefore, in the marketplace, waraqka 'twenty' denotes the 100 CFA coin and
jember foo One thousand' denotes the 5000 CFA banknote. However, milyo foo One
 million' (cf. French million) is directly equated with 1,000,000 CFA (French million
francs) rather than a million riyals (=5,000,000 CFA).
      In stating the unit prices of commodities, distributive reduplications of numerals
 are commonly used (§5.4.4).
      Clock times are now commonly expressed in French (e.g. trois heures et demi
 '3:30'). The traditional time-of-day expressions revolve around the five daily Muslim
prayers as coordinates, supplemented by a few other expressions. See §11.1.4 for
details.","[110, 111]"
"     That baa 'want' has a special sense 'be about to' as serial verb is shown by
examples with inanimate subjects ('the wall wanted to [=was about to] collapse'). For
'want' plus a subjunctive complement clause, see §9.6.1.
     Next we have some serial verbs which specify that the core eventuality occurred
before the temporal reference point: bey 'know' ('have ever VP-ed'), faati 'have
already VP-ed', and kokoro 'have VP-ed recently'. Examples in (591).(591)   a.    D: aywa,          ndooso woo, ni                bey

                                               9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbs     311      bey 'know' is used in experiential perfects, which nicely fits its basic sense. As a
serial verb it is most common in negatives (Ί have never ...') as in (591b), and
questions ('have you ever ...'), as in D's query in (591a). Note that H's response in
(59la) omits bey, just as 'ever' is omitted in the corresponding translation. The
translation 'have never' in (59 Ib) shows that the negation takes scope over the
experiential perfective ('it is not the case that [I have ever seen him]').
      faati 'pass' (<Ar.) is uncommon as a simple verb (cf. bisa 'pass'), but is more
common as a serial verb meaning 'already', as in (59Ic). A negative takes scope over
it, as in (591d), giving the sense 'not [... already]'. This is close to the sense 'not yet',
but the usual way to express this is negation plusjinaa 'first, for now', which is fact
is used in D's repetition of H's point in (591d).
      Serial verbs expressing habituality or iteration are oindi 'remain', dooney 'do
habitually', yee 'return', and fitta 'repeat'. In all cases the serial-verb use is closely
related to the core lexical sense. Examples are in (592a-h).(592)    a. ije-keyna       di^ o          oindi     [ka      jafa      yene]

         c. a      si          yee       [ka filla [Ksa          haya foo koyne]]

            3SgS ImpfNeg can"" [Inf repeat [Inf eat]]
            'It (=donkey) can't eat any more.'
312     9 Sentence-level syntax and semantics     cindi 'remain' can be used with imperfective aspect, as in (592a), to indicate
present-time continuity. However, this serial verb is especially common with
unmarked (perfective) aspect, indicating past habitual ('used to'), dooney can often be
glossed 'be accustomed to', but as (592b) shows it need not have a sentient agent and
the most appropriate general gloss is 'do usually*.
     yee 'return' is semantically weak, and even in simple motion contexts it nearly
always combines with either Centripetal -kate in the sense 'come back' (§6.3.3), or
with another motion verb in a serial construction, like yee ka koy (592d). In the
more abstract sense 're-VP, VP again' with a non-motional substantive VP, we
generally get either filla 'repeat' by itself (592e-f,h) or a combination of yee and filla
in either order (592c,g). filla is notable in that it optionally omits the usual Inf ka
before the following substantive VP. ka is absent after filla in (592c,e,g), but present
in (592h). Both yee and filla combine easily with a negative in the sense 'not VP
again' or 'no longer VP'. In both positive and negative contexts, yee and filla are
often reinforced by the adverbial particle koyne 'again' (§1 1.1.5), as in (592c,e-f).
     duu 'get, earn' as serial verb is best glossed 'proceed to VP' or '(and) then VP'.
This hopefully captures the flavor of this combination, which indicates sequencing
after the previously described event but also adds a little extra foregrounding (593).(593)     a.   saa foo yo yer o             kani^ i     se hawey,               hal

"     The best case for an existential reading of foo is in the scope of a simple negative.
Here the compositional sense is of the type 'not (even) one X', which effectively denies
the existence of any denoted entity, as in (106).(106)         ma       na       bana [haya         foo]
              2SgS     Neg      pay     [thing     one]
              'You(Sg) didn't pay (=haven't paid) anything.'     (106) means, in quasi-logical notation, 'There is not (even) one χ such that χ is a
thing and you paid x.' For more on interactions between foo and negation, see §9.3.3.
     Some examples of reduplication and parallelism discussed in §5.4.4 also have
existential implications, though no such construction is purely existential.",[105]
"     Here nda 'with' is used in the comparative sense 'than ...'. In more idiomatic
English translation, 'even' would be shifted ('... which is even harder than cement'). In
KCh, wala in this emphatic sense remains closely attached to the focal constituent.
Perhaps shifting it out of this constituent to any earlier position where wala is
syntactically permitted would risk confusion with this particle's more common sense
Or'.
     wala is common in negative sentences ('[not] even'), as in (423).(423)          ay     si         mey wala^ allaara
               ISgS ImpfNeg have even riyal
               Ί don't have even a riyal (small coin).'",[252]
"
9.7.6 Quantifying and negative serial verbslilsa 'prepare' does not seem to be used as a serial verb '(do) very much, (do) well'.
The functional equivalent of this KCh serial- verb construction is to add gumo 'well* as
a postverbal adverb.
     je ~jen is used in the negative sense 'fail to', like KChjen.
      VP [ka tontö] means 'VP some more (additionally)', with tonto ~ tonton 'add,
augment' .",[444]
"     However, when the sentence with negation and koyne follows a parallel negative
clause ('notX'), we occasionally get the reading '... not [Y] either', paraphrasable as
'again [it is not the case that [Y]]', where koyne rather than the negator has wide
scope. The final koyne in (479) appears to be an example of this. The first koyne after
alhoor 'limestone' is probably anticipatory, giving a 'neither X, nor Y' construction.(479)         a-a           kaa      sanda haya kaa hasara,
              3SgS-Impf become like           thing Rel be-ruined,

              3SgS Neg be banco, 3SgS Neg be brick again
              'It (deposit of poor-quality limestone) turns out to be something that

other Songhay variaties. A simple example is (757a). (757b) shows that it follows
any embedded clauses—here a quotative—, and also shows how ba may cooccur with a
higher-level negative a na ti 'it is not (the case that...)' in querying function.(757)    a.   B        go         koyra       bal

"
9.5.3 Juxtaposed clauses in adverbial function ('while', 'without')When two clauses are juxtaposed, the second sometimes functions as a temporal
adverbial clause translatable as 'while' (if positive) or 'without' (if negative), as in
(501). 'While' is to be taken in its temporal (= 'during') rather than adversative sense
(= 'whereas'). Note that 'without knowing' is logically equivalent to 'while not
knowing', so the 'while' is consistent.(501)    a.   ammaa [saa di kaa] a                 kar,
              but      [time Def Rel] 3SgS hit,
              [a       kar] [hew        sii^    [a      ra]]
              [3SgS hit]      [wind be^not [3Sg Loc]]
              'But when it (=rain) struck, it struck while there was no wind.'
         b.   [no-o         bisa [a ga]] [ni           si        bey]
              [2SgS-Impf pass [3Sg by]] [2SgS ImpfNeg know]
              'You'll pass by it without knowing'     This type of construction normally consists of an initial clause denoting a
foregrounded event, followed by a brief second clause denoting a temporally extended
state or process that is not caused by the first event. The best way to make sense of
such a combination is to infer that the second clause denotes a background situation
whose temporal interval contains that of the event denoted by the first clause. The
second clause is most often in imperfective aspect. It can, however, be in the
unmarked perfective aspect, for example when this clause is negated, as in (648a-b) in
§10.2.4.
     There is no overt morpheme meaning precisely 'while ...'. Both saa di kaa ...
'when ..., (at) the time that...' and nda ... 'if (when) ...' are strongly associated with
temporal sequence rather than overlap. The only obvious alternative to (501a), then, is
272     9 Sentence-level syntax and semanticsto invert the order (""There was no wind; the rain struck'). In the case of 'without',
there is an alternative construction involving bilaa 'without' (<Ar.) and a subjunctive
clause, see §9.6.4.
     When two juxtaposed clauses are both imperfective, they may be fused in
somewhat the same way as in (501), but it is not always the case that the second
clause functions as an adverbial modifier of the first. Consider (502).(502)         yee       kaa     ta hää ga         [wala [addeliil foo  ga]
              ISgSImpf come Inf ask 3SgO [or            [reason which? on]

                 was coming to ask him^, for which reason (=why) did hex not
               respond when I greeted himx.'","[287, 288]"
"     The examples in (405) show clear separation between the negative clause and the
following exception phrase. This is always found with subject NPs, since the subject
NP of the negative clause is always separated from the 'except' phrase by other
material. However, optionally in the case of clause-final direct objects, and even more
commonly with other clause-final constituents (spatiotemporal adverbials,
instrumental phrases), the correlative constituent in the negative clause is dispensed
with and we get what looks like a single clause. Examples in (406).(406)     a.   wirci woo si              din    bara   farka      kul kaa yekuwa
               disease Dem ImpfNeg seize except donkey all Rel                be-solid

              'There are many ailments that they can't cure except with alkaafun
                (spice).'     (406a-b) involve direct object NPs, (406c) a spatiotemporal adverbial, and (406d-e)
instrumental NPs. When the constituent in question is a direct object, the fuller two-
part construction (405b-c) appears to be grammatically preferable to the single-clause
pattern (406a-b). In (406a), for example, the quantifier kul 'all' (= 'any') shows up on
the NP in the 'except' phrase, though it would make more sense on the (omitted)
correlative NP in the initial negative clause (""That disease doesn't afflict any donkey,
except a donkey that is healthy'). I think, then, that we can regard the single-clause
type (406a-b) as a truncated version of the fuller construction.
     The two instrumental examples (406d-e) show different word orders, kala 'except'
preceding nda in (406d), while bara 'except' follows nda in (406e). Follow-up
elicitation with Timbuktu informants showed that nda bara X and bara nda X are
interchangeable.
     There are some textual examples where bara or kala takes scope over a following
clause denoting an eventuality that serves as an exception to that expressed by the
preceding negative clause. Here we gloss bara or kala freely as 'except that ...'. This
is arguably the case in (407a-c).(407)    a.   bana sii_^     a    ra,    haya foo sii^        a      ra    bara

9.6.2 Subjunctive complements of obligational barabara occurs in various functions: verb of existence (§7.1.3), 'except' particle (§8.5.3),
and 'because ...' particle (§9.5.7). Leaving these aside, it occurs sentence-initially in
two impersonal constructions, one with following bare indicative complement
associated particularly with oaths and other strong assertions (§9.5.9), the other with a
following subjunctive complement, usually in obligational sense (bara [X Subju see
Y] = 'X must see Y').
     In the subjunctive (mainly obligational) construction that concerns us here,
nothing precedes bara within the sentence. Negation is expressed inside the
subjunctive clause (bara [X Subju not see Y] = 'X must not see Y'). Focus too is
expressed, if at all, inside the subjunctive clause, as in the elicited examples (552a-b).(552)     a.   bara ni       ijga   ma      koy, a       na c£ ey

"     A much more colorful and slightly vulgar alternative is laafriiti, which can be
used as a serial verb meaning roughly 'VP a hell of a lot'. This stem (from an Arabic
noun denoting a type of djinn) is also used after a noun or adjective as an intensifier ('a
hell of a N').
     The serial verbs denoting failure to accomplish an expected or intended event are
jen 'fail at' and morjgo 'have no power over, fail at'. As serial verbs, jen indicates
nonperformance of an action, while moqgo (596c) indicates inability to perform the
action, jen is most common in the negative 'not fail to VP' (596a) but also occurs in
the positive; moggo is usually positive (596b). jen is etymologically related to the
noun -jegey 'lack', used as a compound final (§4.6.5).(596)    a.   ay^ jaati si     jen [ka mey [a kuna]

7.2.4 Subjunctive moodI use the term ""subjunctive"" to denote the mood category expressed by preverbal MAN
morpheme ma. The negative counterpart is ma si. si is elsewhere specifically
Imperfective Negative (ImpfNeg), but in ma si we gloss it simply as ""Neg.""
     Unwary readers of texts might confuse Subju ma with the 2SgS allomorph ma.
When ma is preceded by an overt subject NP (or pronominal), it can only be the
Subju morpheme. The 2SgS interpretation is possible only when no other subject NP
is present. Moreover, Subju ma is always followed either by the verb or by Neg si
plus the verb, while 2Sg ma occurs visibly only in 2Sg (perfective) Neg ma na
VERB ... . When 2SgS and Subju combine, we get a simple ma VERB ... , and one
could argue about whether the ma in this construction is a 2SgS or Subju morpheme;
we gloss it in this case as ""2SgSubju"" (§3.8.3).
     The only other irregular subjunctive form is the optional, and fairly uncommon,
ISgSSubju variant ye. The more common variant, ay ma, is regular in form. Some
subjunctive examples are in (258).

1.3 Format of grammarThe present grammar of KCh is written in a fairly strict format to facilitate
comparison to the appendices and to my forthcoming parallel descriptions of other
Songhay languages. The numbering of chapters and sections thereof will be held
constant to the extent possible, although this means that in each grammar some
subsections are blank (e.g., ""tonology"" in the present grammar). In Appendix 1 on the
""upriver"" (Goundarm, Niafunke) varieties, and to a lesser extent in Appendix 2 on
DjCh, we disregard areas where their grammars do not differ significantly from that of
Timbuktu KCh (perhaps giving an example or two), reserving extended analysis for
areas where they differ from Timbuktu.
     The format of the grammar is not revolutionary, and its general nature can be
gleaned from a pass through the table of contents. We begin with a brief overview
chapter (2), designed to give readers an idea what a simple Songhay sentence looks
like. Fortunately, the language is simple morphologically and readers should be able to
pick up its basic sentence structure quickly. A brief chapter on phonology (3) leads to
two chapters (4, 5) on nominal constructions, the first focusing on derivational
processes (also including information on personal and demonstrative pronouns), the
second describing NP inflection and phrasal syntax.
     Verbs likewise get two chapters (6, 7), one mainly on voice categories expressed
by suffixation (or by zero), the other on mood-aspect-negation (MAN) inflection and
VP structure.
     The next chapter (8) turns to ""information packaging"" issues such as focus, topic,
and relativization. These are all of great importance in Songhay discourse, and it turns
out that there are important differences among the Songhay varieties in the respective
forms and functions. This is followed by a chapter (9) on complex (interclausal)
syntax, in which various types of ""serial verb"" construction play important roles. The
final grammatical chapter (10) is on anaphora; the most significant topic here is the
use of logophoric and reflexive versus ordinary personal pronouns.
     The last chapter (11) looks at selected lexical semantic matters, including the
lexical division of labor in expressing spatiotemporal concepts, and some
ethnosemantic issues such as kinship and emotion terminology.
     A volume of Texts in Koyra Chiini (Songhay of Timbuktu) is in press with
Koppe Verlag, Cologne. It includes texts from Timbuktu, Niafunke (an ""upriver""
dialect), and Djenne. A set of three Songhay-English-French dictionaries is to be
published by rHarmattan, Paris. One of the three is KCh (Timbuktu to Niafunke), and
another is for DjCh (the third is KS of Gao).
6     1 Introductionl .4 Transcriptional conventionsKCh is quite simple morphologically and there are few productive phonological rules
disguising underlying (lexical) phonological representations. Double slashes // ... //
enclose underlying representations (not italicized). In the grammar text, brackets [ ... ]
enclose phonetic representations. The ordinary phonemic transcription is italicized
without slashes or brackets. We use the hyphen ""-"" as a morpheme boundary in a fairly
restricted set of cases where it seems justified. Examples are verb stems containing a
derivational suffix (Fact-Caus or Mediop -ndi), such as dira-ndi 'cause to walk'.
     It has been difficult to decide whether to use hyphens in noun-noun compounds,
noun-adjective combinations, and similar close-knit stem sequences showing various
degrees of lexicalization. There is no consistent phonological test for lexicalization of
such combinations, and other criteria (frequency, semantic specialization) are gradient
rather than categorical. In general, I use hyphens in compounds sparingly (when the
combination seems fairly clearly lexicalized), and in combinations involving high-
frequency finals such as -ije 'child' and -fiaa 'mother'. However, readers should not put
too much stock in these transcriptional decisions.
     My most idiosyncratic transcriptional decision is to use the subscripted ligature
""^"" to indicate assimilations across word or morpheme boundaries. This enables us to
show the basic forms of the morphemes in question, maintaining the transparency of
the morpheme structure, while at the same time at least hinting at the surface
pronunciation.
     In the case of nasal consonants, a ligature indicates point-of-articulation
assimilation to a following segment, generally n —> [η] before velar stop. The
expected parallel shifty—> [n] before alveolar consonant is moot in Timbuktu KCh,
where lexical stem-final η is normally absent, but occurs in upriver KCh dialects
which allow stem-final η.","[21, 22]"
"
7.1.2 Locational quasi-verbs goo, siiThe basic locational predicators are goo 'be (in a place)' and its negation sii 'not be (in
a place), be absent'. Each is normally followed by a more concrete LP (locational
phrase, §5.12) such as a place name, adverbial, or PP. I refer to them loosely as
""quasi-verbs,"" but their peculiarities are different from those of other quasi-verbs
described in the adjoining sections. Examples in (234).(234)    a. i        goo       nee
            3P1S     be        here
            'They are here.'
         b. a        sii              [huu      di       ra]
            3SgS     be-absent [house           Def      Loc]
            'He (She, It) is not in the house.'     goo is clearly related to Impf (positive) ο ~ go (<*go), as is sii to ImpfNeg si. In
sentences with ordinary verbs, ο and si are members of the set of MAN (mood-aspect-
negation) morphemes that intervene between subject NP and verb (§7.2.1). That the
connection between {goo sii} and the cognate imperfect!ve morphemes ο ~ go and si is
synchronically real is shown by the fact that the imperfective morphemes are
pronounced goo and sii in the one situation where they are clause-final; namely, in
truncated replies to yes-no questions and similar echoes (§8.2.1). Moreover, locational
{goo sii} cannot be preceded by MAN morphemes (#o goo, #ma goo, etc.).
     If we were to assume that the ""verb"" position is obligatorily filled in any
predicate, the preferred analysis of (234a-b) would be to take {goo sii} as verbs, albeit
a special type of verbs which do not allow MAN morphemes. Alternatively, since
these quasi-verbs are apparently morphemically identical to the cognate preverbal
MAN morphemes, one could argue that {goo sii} in (234a-b) are simply stressed
allomorphs of Impf (positive) ο ~ go and ImpfNeg si, used when the following verb
position is vacant (a possibility limited to locationals). The two analyses lead to the
alternative parsings in (235a-b) for sentence (234a).(235)            subject NP      MAN morphemes           verb             locational
              a.     i               0                   goo                nee
              b.     /               goo                 0                  nee
              c.     /               goo                 BE                 nee
              d.     i               tx                  βοοχ+ BE           nee     I favor (236b) over (236a). However, we might also consider additional variations
on the general approach (235b), represented here as (235c-d). In (235c), goo is a MAN
morpheme as in (235b), but the verb position is filled by a ""light"" (i.e. low-content)
verb BE that happens to be phonologically null. In (235d) we have started out with the
                                                        7.1 Types of predicates       149same structure, but the MAN morpheme goo has then been fused or adjoined to BE,
perhaps leaving a (coindexed) trace tx behind.
      In (235c-d), we might equate the BE verb specifically with bara 'be, exist'
(following section). In any event, forms with overt bara are closely related
syntactically to the goo and sii sentences we have been discussing. There are three
syntactic contexts where goo and sii are syntactically impossible, and where
constructions involving bara are used instead. First, goo and sii cannot be used in
subjunctives, where they are replaced by, respectively, the positive and negative
subjunctive of bara. The subjunctive equivalent of (234a) is therefore / ma bara nee
'that they be here.' Second, goo and sii cannot be used in imperatives, so we again
make use of the subjunctive of bara to fill the void; see (266) in §7.3. Third, goo is
not allowed in infinitival VPs, again requiring the use of bara, as in ... ka bara nee
'... to be here.' We can therefore get a very close approximation to the surface facts by
arguing that there is an underlying existential-locative BE verb which is realized as
zero following imperfective morphemes, and as bara elsewhere. In order to actually
formalize this analysis, we would have to distinguish this BE, realized as (0 ~ bara,},
from bara2 in the sense 'exist', since bara2 can occur after Impf as well as other MAN
morphemes (following section). In any event, existential-locative BE is clearly distinct
from equational or identificational quasi-verbs (oi 'be', ποπό 'it is') described above.
      Although goo and sii in (234a-b) are basically locational rather than pure
existentials, in some textual occurrences the following LP seems to be nearly pro
forma, and the clause comes close to a pure existential predication with little emphasis
on location. The favorite ""bleached"" locationals used for this purpose are doodi ~ dooti
'there* and third person pronominal Locative PPs such as a ra 'in it, therein'. Both
occur in (236), which describes how one detects limestone deposits in the bush; the
key phrases are bolded in the free translation as well as in the interlinears.(236)        jombu-jombu woo di                ye na nda yer guqguma

150 7 VP structure     Unlike English bleached there in there is (are)..., the locationals a ra 'in it' and
doodi 'there' have at least vestiges of a locational denotation, but in passages like this
the location has already been established in prior discourse. In other cases, the location
is vague or indefinite, making the existential function even harder to miss, as in (237).
Even when there is no overt LP, a locational is implied, as in (238).(237)         wirci      foo moo goo doodi, kaa^ ci wirci jaas-o
              disease one also be there, Rel            be disease bad

               disease.'
(238)         a          goo
              3SgS       be
              'Here she is!Or ""There she is!'     (238) is usually rendered as la voila or la void in local French and has a similar
presentative quality. For more on presentatives, see §7.2.3.
     There is another, completely different use of a goo and similar combinations of a
pronoun with goo or sii, only superficially identical to the presentative type (238).
This is the pattern exemplified by a 500 '(Yes) it is' and ay sii '(No) I don't' used in
truncated replies to yes-no questions and in similar echoing contexts (§8.2.1). This
type has no presentative or locational-existential connotations.
     Locational quasi-verbs have no difficulty occurring in relativized or focus
constructions. Examples in (239).(239)    a.   maa        rjga      goo    nee ?
              what?      S Foe be         here?
              'What [focus] is here?'

              where?     Foe       3SgS be ?
              'Where [focus] is he?'     (239c) and similar instances with clause-final 500 (or sii) only superficially
resemble the presentative type (238). (239c), unlike (238), does have an overt LP
complement, the only difference being that in (239c) the LP (man 'where?') has been
fronted as part of the focalization process that is regular with WH interrogatives. We
could represent (239c) as manx na a goo tx with a phonologically unrealized trace to
make this clear.
                                                        7.1 Types of predicates     1517.1.3 Existential and impersonal quasi-verb baraThe form bara occurs in several constructions. We disregard here the 'except'
construction with following NP (§8.5.3) and the clause-initial use as a 'because'
complementizer (§9.5.7), in order to focus on its verbal and quasi-verbal uses.
     First, bara is used in the normal verb position (following a subject NP and MAN
morphemes) as an existential predicator 'exist'. We have noted in the preceding section
that locationals of the type 'be there' or 'be in it' can also be used in a fashion
approaching existential predications, so the use of bara as an existential is somewhat
circumscribed. In general, bara is preferred when the existant is abstract, unlocalized,
or too diffuse to be meaningfully localized. Examples in (240).(240)    a.   saa      kaa       keydiya^      ο       bara

              time     Rel       monsoon       ImpfNeg    be
              'when there is no rainy season'     Note that bara can be preceded by Impf o or ImpfNeg si. The ability to appear
after MAN morphemes distinguishes bara from locational quasi-verbs goo and sii
(§7.1.2) and from identificational nono (§7.1.1). Note also that bara does not require a
following LP (locational phrase), though such a phrase could be added to (240a-b).
     bara replaces locational goo in certain constructions where goo is syntactically
impermissible. This use of bara does not translate easily as 'exist', so it may be
useful to recognize a distinct abstract locational BE that is realized as 0 after
imperfective morphemes and as bara, elsewhere, distinct from bara2 'exist', as
suggested in the preceding section. Negative locational sii is likewise replaced by a
negated form of bara2. These replacements occur in the subjunctive mood with ma,
which cannot co-occur with {goo sii} or with the imperfective morphemes related to
the latter; an example is (241a). Using ""L"" to represent the locational, X goo L 'X is
in L* has subjunctive counterpart X ma bara L 'that X may be in L,' while its
negation X sii L 'X is not in L' becomes X ma si bara L 'that X may not be in
L'. Likewise, in the infinitival VP construction with Inf ka, bara replaces goo. In
(241b), the infinitival construction is required by serial verb hima.(241)    a.   yee          baa ay        ma       bara nee jirjgar ban
              ISgSImpf want ISgS Subju be               here holiday day

              'He ought to be in Bamako.'","[164, 165, 166, 167]"
"     The vast majority of causatives are expressed by using the productive Causfative]
derivation (§6.2.2), or by simply switching valency with no overt change in the verb
stem (§6.2.1). However, (548) is an appropriate use of the more complex (but more
transparent) analytic causative construction, since the lower clause contains an internal
negation which could not be precisely captured in a compressed monoclausal version.
     Next we consider verbs of allowing and preventing (543c). In these constructions,
the subject of the subjunctive clause is almost always distinct from the subject NP of
the matrix clause. Examples in (549).(549)    a.   yer junubu yo rjga jendi [baana ma                       kar]
              1P1 sin          PI SFoc prevent [rain          Subju hit]

         c.   n         si         yedda [ay ma             koy ka nan ni]
              2SgS ImpfNeg consent [ISgS Subju go                  Inf leave 2SgO]

              Inf      precede [3SgS Subju die]
              'if hex gave someoney a thing before hex died'     Note that ""positive"" nan 'let' and yedda 'consent', as well as ""negative"" jendi
'prevent' (= 'not let'), have the subjunctive complement. This is a further indication
that deontic modality (here: intention) is more significant than degree of likely truth in
determining the use of the subjunctive mood.
     For nan 'let', I have also recorded a construction with an intervening hal 'so that'
(in other contexts 'until'), as in (550a). For hal as subjunctive trigger see §9.6.4. In
villages near Timbuktu, nan can take indicative as well as subjunctive complements;
an indicative example is (550b). I did not hear such a construction in Timbuktu itself.(550)    a.   ni    si         nan hal [i      ma        hlsa ka nin kul]
              2SgS ImpfNeg leave until [3P1S Subju do-muchlnf ripen all]

              ISgS leave [3P1S go]
              Ί allowed them to go.'
294     9 Sentence-level syntax and semantics    Though not real subjunctive triggers, noo 'give' and kate ~ kata in the literal
sense 'bring, fetch' are often immediately followed by a bare subjunctive complement
denoting a projected follow-up action, as in (551).(551)          ... wala wor o         noo kuuru
               ... or    2P1S Impf give skin

"     In (285a-d), a nonzero MAN morpheme intervenes between rjga and the verb, as
the schema in (283) allows. The nonzero MAN morphemes are Subju ma (285a),
ImpfNeg si (285b), Neg na (285c), and Impf o (285d). In the cases with negation, the
negative has scope only over the backgrounded core sentence. Thus (285c) means 'it's
my whole head that did not bring it up' rather than 'it's not my whole head that
brought it up.'(285)    a.   nda      a         na      ci jaman di rjga            ma     hasara

9.3.3 Negation and quantifiersA negative morpheme [si sii na} often co-occurs intrasententially with a quantifier.
We begin by considering foo One', which often functions as an indefinite in
existential contexts (467).

"     So neither sanda nor allaa means simply 'like, similar to'. Further examples of
ai/aaare (252f,i) in §7.2.2 and (670) in §10.3.1.
     The two nouns taka 'manner, (essential) type' and cinne ~ cilde - cille 'peer,
equal' are common as compound finals (or possessed nouns) in expressions that can be
translated freely as 'like X', where X is the compound initial (or possessor). The
compound type X taka means, more precisely, 'something of the same type as X,
something like X', while X cinne means 'a peer or equal of X, the likes of X'. These
finals often co-occur with sanda or a7/aa preceding the compound, as in (416c) with
sanda ... cinne and as in (417c) with taka ... allaa... sanda ... taka. Further examples

234     <S Discourse-functional constructions and relativization8.5.7 dee, mee, gaadee is a particle that can be used a) clause-finally as an emphatic with no necessary
relationship to any following material, or b) linking two clauses (often pronounced at
the onset of the second clause).
     In the clause-final use, dee emphasizes the proposition as a whole and may have
an adversaria] pragmatic nuance (cf. English unstressed now with warning tone in
Don't stay out late now!). It can be used to given a tone of finality to an assertion that
contradicts or challenges a position taken by the addressee, or to an assertion likely to
be disbelieved. It can also give an admonishing tone to an imperative. It is common in
rhetorically charged contexts such as haggling in the marketplace (419).(419)          πο-o          koy yoobu, i-i            neere ga       doodi,
               2SgS-Impf go market, 3PlS-Impf see              3SgO there,

                moreover they (=sellers) will tell you 'definitely 300 (riyals)', or
                'definitely 400'; a market person (=seller) just haggles (over prices)
                until the point where God has given you(Sg) the thing that
                whatchamacallits (=is needed).'","[249, 250]"
"    Essentially, haya foo here functions as a kind of ""etcetera"" verb that can be
roughly glossed 'be or do anything'. Its clause is generally the last in a series of
negative clauses, and caps them by generalizing the negation to the set of imaginable
154 7 VP structurepropositions of the same general sort as the preceding ones. In (247a) the preceding
verbja/a 'cut, carve' is used in a mediopassive sense 'be cuttable', so here haya foo
represents 'be X-able' for any similar transitive action verb, for example 'carve' or
'break'. In (247b), haya foo caps the series 'get tired ... , break a sweat ...' and by
implication denotes the set of similar expressions involving fatigue or other
discomfort.
     Like haya foo in (247), interrogative maa 'what?' (§8.2.2) can be used as an
apparent verb, as in (248).(248)         a-a               maa ?
              3SgS-Impf        what?
              'She (is or does) what?' (= 'She whats?')     The 'whatchamacallit1 words haywana, hajje, and haya-jje (§8.2.6) have the
same capacity. When used as verbs, they are usually intransitive, but can also be
transitive as in (249a-b).(249)    a. yee                 haya-jje              ga

"     In (173a) it is difficult to decide whether the reading is exclusive or inclusive. At
the collective level, crates are constructed from wood of any of the three spp.
mentioned. Individual crates are normally of one or the other, but the assertion would
presumably be true even for crates made from mixed pieces of wood. In (173b), the
disjunction 'machete or pick-ax' is under the scope of bilaa 'without'. Such negative
contexts distinctly favor inclusive readings, which in this context are stronger than
exclusive readings.
