"4.2.8. Negative forms: Negation is marked by various forms; some
preceding the verbal root, some following it. In negative
constructions all the tenses are not marked: In non-past and past
tenses ho:to is used to mark negation. It can occur preceding or
following the verb.           ho:to-kappo 'does not/did not sleep', (kappo ‘to sleep’),           jo istan-ki e:riḍa:n engki ga:ḍi ho:to ghaṭa-jere

                  Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION   The term nahal in the Nihali/Nahali language means ‘tiger’ or
‘lion’. Russel and Hiralal (1916) describe the Nahal or Nihal as a
hybrid of the Bhil and Korku. They were also identified with an
ancient community, called Nahalka, mentioned in Padma Purana as
an offshoot of the Nishada. The Nahals are subdivided into
Raghuvanshi and Tavadia sections. The Korku, who first migrated
to the Berar region of Madhya Pradesh, found the Nahal in
possession of the hills. Gradually, the Nahals lost their land. They
are notified under the nomenclature Nihal/Nahul as a scheduled
tribe, and are grouped along with the Korku, Bopchi, Mouasai,
Bondhi and Bondeya. At present, the Nahals of this area speak
Nimari, an Indo-Aryan language. However, in some places like
Buldhana district of Maharashtra, Nahals speak their own language,
which is highly influenced by Korku and other languages. The
Nahals are further divided into a number of totemic clans (nata).
Monogamy is the norm. They mainly subsist on agriculture labour.
They are mostly employed as labourers in agricultural fields by
other communities. (From K.S.Singh’s People of India book)   Nihali, also Nahali, had 3600 speakers according to 1961 census
of India reports. The speakers are found in an area of about fifty
square miles in the northern extremes of Buldhana district of
Maharashtra. Though Nihals are found in Amravati district of
Maharashtra and East Nimar district of Madhya Pradesh, in the
foothills of the western-most range of the Satpuda mountains they
no longer speak their own speech form. According to the available
information there are no monolingual adult Nihals. Only two brief
descriptive articles have appeared on this language so far.
However, comparative studies have been somewhat richer, since the
genetic relation of Nihali is a matter of dispute. Konow believed
the language to be Munda, with heavy Dravidian and Indo-Aryan
2                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyaccretion. But even the Munda element consists largely of Korku
loans, and in 1941 R.Shafer proposed that Nahali represents an
altogether separate stock. F.B.J. Kuiper has shown that over 20
percent of the available vocabulary of Nahali is unrelated to that of
any Indian linguistic family. The present study corroborates with
this view.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
"Also, sometimes another negative form from Hindi (?) bigar
‘without’ is used.:(116)      bigar joppoki nawki ji:wta:ken
           ‘Without water how (one) will live ?’ho:ṭo: In past tense ho:to ~ ho:ṭo is used to mark negation. So no
separate tense marker is used. It always precedes the verb. In the
process, the final vowel of it gets dropped in some cases, and in
some cases the second consonant of it undergoes assimilation
(which is optional) to the consonant of the next word.(117)(a)    ho:ṭo-kappo 'did not sleep' (kappo ‘to sleep’),     (b)    se ra:m a:wa:r-ke pa:ṭi/ho:ṭpa:ṭo (without assimilation)
            yesterday Ram house-to come-pt /not come-np
            ‘Yesterday Ram came home/ did not come home’   As can be seen above, in negative construction no tense marker is
used, while in positive construction tense marker is required. But it
can take aspectual marker -ḍa:n.(118)(a)    jo nene ma:nḍi ho:ṭcakni
            I your word not listen

"3.7.6. Negative forms: Negation is marked by various forms; some
occur preceding the verbal root, some following it. The negative
markers (forms) are the following: beṭhe, ho:ṭo, biji, hayom, and
bikhil. The last one is not frequently used. Probably it may be a
variant of beṭhe. In negative constructions all the tenses are not
marked. Among these negatives, while biji marks negative
imperativeness; beṭhe is used in non-past constructions; ho:ṭo is
used in past tense only; and hayom is used only in constructions
which express a sense of unfulfilled expectations.
A set may be provided as a sample.:
76                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(112) a:pa ‘to weep’: a:pa biji ‘don’t weep’ (imp.)
                      a:pa beṭhe ‘does/will not weep’
                      ho:ṭo a:pa ‘did not weep’.beṭhe: Used in non-past constructions. It can either occur preceding
or following the verb stem. Normally it precedes the verb in a
sentence; but it can occur after a verb as well, when the verb is of
predicate adjective type or equational type, etc.:beṭhe occurring before a verb:
(113)(a) jo beṭhe ha:goken
         I neg laugh-pr
         ‘I do not laugh’.     (b) nanika         beṭhe pa:ṭo
          anyone/someone neg come
          ‘no one comes’.
       vs. nanika pa:ṭoka ‘someone comes/ will come’   When this negative form occurs before a verb, often it comes
under assimilatory influences with the following verb. First of all,
the second syllable of beṭhe gets dropped; and the first consonant of
the verb gets geminated. It may be noted that it is optional, as it does
not happen always.(114)(a) kyamp jo beppa:ṭo
         tomorrow I not come –pr
         ‘tomorrow I will not come’
         [beṭhe > dropping of 2nd syllable; and be- > bep /-p]     (b) inginki sokra bebbe

also mean ‘home’/ ‘family’, so it can take hiṭkel, as in the following:(189)      i:r-a:wa:r hiṭkel ‘two houses’ (= members of two houses)
           kho:bo a:wa:r ‘many houses’

      ‘a stick in one hand and a lantern in another hand…’   Oppositive NPs can contain two NPs in opposition. Here is an
instance of the same. In this phrase enge bakkoka kha:na pi:na and
another NP acca-acca pakwa:n are in opposition. The first NP is a
possessive construction, ‘my hand’s food (= eating-drinking)’. The
112                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularysecond part qualifies the first part. It is in opposition to the second
NP acca-acca pakwa:n ‘good-good food’.(194)    enge bakkoka kha:na pi:na acca-acca pakwa:n…

         ‘my hand’s food drink good-good delicious items…’3.12.3. Verb phrases: These are made up a main verb, being
obligatorily present and preceded by either an adverbial
construction and or an object. A few illustrations can be provided
here. The first is an imperative construction, where both the subject
and second person are absent, and supposed to be covertly present.
Interestingly it contains an adverbial element as first member, jaldi
‘quickly’, followed by an indirect object, basel he:la:ki ‘to the
children’, and an object, beḍe-beḍe mitha:yi ‘one-one sweet’, and
finally the verb, in imperative formation, be:-ki ‘give’.(195)     jaldi basel he:la-ki beḍe-beḍe mitha:yi be:ki
          quickly child-all-to one-one sweet-obj give-imp.
          'Give quickly one-one sweet to all the children'   In the next two illustrations, the adverbial elements occur after
the subject NP, and followed by the main verb.(196)(a) jo seko:n minḍi ḍecco celom-na kappi

pronoun jo ‘I’, or ne ‘you’(sg.); followed by the verbal complex
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                               113containing the object backaren ‘children’ in (a), and hi-ka:mo ‘this

        'I bathed the baby'.     (b) ne hi-ka:mo kama:ken
         you this-work do-can
         ‘You can do this work’In the following two instances, the NP is more fuller in structure. In
(a), it is made up of a possessive construction, dharamra:ja-na orari
‘dharamraja’s wedding’ followed by the verbal structure. Similarly,
in (b) the NP is made up of the plural demonstrative hiṭkel taking a
postposition minja:r ‘middle’, to obtain hiṭkella minja:r ‘between
them’; followed by the object, tago-jagṛa ‘quarrel/fight’, and the
verb of happening, jere- in past tense.(198)(a) dharamra:ja-na orari     jerey-ḍa:n

        ‘they both fought with each other’   The above illustrations provide some insight into the internal
structures of sentences. They also reveal the place of adverbials
when they occur. In the following, various types of sentences both
from the nature of the verb, and from the complexity will be
discussed. In this process it is hoped that some more insights will be
available as far as the language structure is concerned.
114                       The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary
3.12.4. Types of sentences:(a) Existential sentences:
These sentences will have the main verb of ‘to be’ type. But in
negative constructions, as in (c) below, the verb for be is imne/imni
is used in positive constructions; while in negative constructions hey
+ beṭhe ‘negative form’ is used.(199)(a) a:wa:r-sammaki mandir ḍa:n
         house-front-in     temple is
         ‘there is a temple in front of the house’      (b)   biya-kon paslaki para:y ḍa:n
             village-of behind-to river is
             ‘there is a river behind the village’      (c)   paray-ki joppo imni/e
            river-in water be
            ‘there is water in the river’ vs.            paray-ki joppo hey beṭhe:la
            river-in water be neg
            ‘there is no water in the river’(b) Identificational sentences:
In this type of constructions no verb is overtly used. Placement of
two NPs sequentially makes a sentence. Here also it is possible to
obtain negative constructions using the negative form beṭhe. For
instance,
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                 115(200)(a) jo / do:ktar ‘I (am) a doctor’ vs. jo / do:ktar beṭhe ‘I
          (am) not a doctor’
     (b) iṭiko:l / guruji ‘that woman (is) teacher’ vs.
          iṭiko:l / guruji/ beṭhe ‘that woman (is) not teacher’
      (c) iṭimanso / korku ‘that man (is) Korku’
      (d) herey / banjara ‘this (person) (is) a banjara’, etc.
      (d) eṭey enge dusman beṭhe ‘he (is) not my enemy’
      (e) eṭey nani ‘who (is) he?’ vs. eṭey ḍa:kṭar ‘he (is) a doctor’
      (f) uṭan na:n ‘what (is) that?’ vs. uṭan ka:kado ‘that (is) a
          paper’(c) Attributive sentences:
This type of sentence also does not take a verb/copula. Here the
attribute of the subject will follow the subject concerned. The result
is a complete sentence. Here also it is possible to obtain negative
constructions by adding negative form beṭhe, as shown below.(201)(a)   hi manso / masto        vs. hi-manso masto beṭhe
           this man good               this-man good-neg
           ‘this man (is) good’        ‘this man (is) not good’      (b) eṭlan a:wa:r/ mera:ki
          his house near-to
          ‘his house (is) near’     (c)   engen a:wa:r/ backa
           my house small
           ‘my house (is) small’     (d)   hi a:ḍḍo / bha:ga lamba
           this tree very long
           ‘this tree (is) very long’      (e) ne /nu-san ‘how (are) you?’ vs. jo masto ‘I (am) fine’
116                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(d) Possessive sentences:
In this type also except for verb imni(c)/imri(c) ‘be’, and ṭha:k- ‘to
have’ type; no other verb is used. Placement of two NPs
sequentially makes a sentence. Here also the negative constructions
can be obtained by using the negative form beṭhe, as shown below.
For instance:(202)(a) a:ḍḍo-ki phu:l imric
          tree-in flower be-np
         ‘the tree has flower’      (b) eṭey gida:r janwarṭa ṭha:ki
          he many animals have-np
          ‘he has many animals’.(203)(a)   ra:m-ki / biḍi-ka bakko
           ram-to one-only hand
           ‘ram (has) one-only hand’       (b) dho:r-ki/ na:lku khuri
           cow-to        four leg
           ‘cow (has) four legs’      (b) a:ṭo-ki / i:rbakko biḍi peñ
          man-to / two hand one head
          ‘man has two hands one head’.      (c) a:wa:rki / biḍi-bi da:na hey beṭhe
          house-at one-even grain be neg
          ‘at home not even a grain is’      (d) ha:n / nanin a:wa:r ‘this whose house ?’ vs. ha:n /enge
          a:wa:r ‘this my house’.
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                              117(e) Interrogative sentences: In this type, the interrogative forms
occur at the end of the sentence. For instance:(204)     ne jumu na:n
          your name what
          ‘What is your name?’
         (See Interrogatives section for details)(f) Negative sentences have been amply illustrated in sec. 3.7.6.
So, they are not discussed here.","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128]"
"   From the above paradigm many aspects of verbal structure
becomes clear and it can be seen that sentences end in verbal
constructions. First of all, the word order is Subject-Verb in an
intransitive sentence. Here, the verb kap- ‘to sleep’ occurs after the
subject jo ‘I’. In a negative sentence, the negative marker normally
occurs preceding the verb. The verbal structure does not show any
68                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyform of agreement with the rest of the sentence. The verbal
structure is pretty simple. The verbal construction carries tense
marker, aspect and mood markers in 'word' structure. The t/a/m
markers follow the verb base.
   In a NP, adjective precedes the Noun. Similarly adverbs precede
the verb. Unlike other language families of the area, there is no
agreement in this language.","[78, 79]"
"In the following ḍa:n is used as an aspectual marker with imne :    (e) eṭla a:wa:rki imne-ḍa:n
        they house-at be-pp
        ‘they had been at home’    (f) a:wa:rminja:r-minja:r-ki biḍi kuyi imne-ḍa:n
         house-inside itself     one well used to be
        ‘in the middle of the house there used to be a well’.
64                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyThere is another verb, a borrowed one, used for the verb ‘be’ hey,
very restrictively, in present tense in negative formation only. For
instance:
(86)(a) eṭey a:wa:rki hey-beṭhe
          he house-at be-neg
          ‘he is not at home’     (b) eṭey hinki hey beṭhe ḍa:n
         he here-at be –neg-pp
         ‘he was not here’     (c) parayki joppo hey-beṭhe
         river-in water be-neg
         ‘there is no water in the river’   As can be seen from the illustrations above, hey is used in
negative constructions with the negative form beṭhe. The positive
construction would be: parayki joppo imni ‘(there) is water in the
river’.jere(y) ‘happen’ is used as a regular verb to convert an active
sentence into an impersonal one. For instance:(87)(a) hiṭkella minja:rki tagojagṛa jerey
        they-between-obj quarrel happen
        ‘between them quarrel happened’     (b) uku:n ba:y a:ra kya:m a:ra uṭhwã-uṭhwã
         so today see tomorrow see like this gradually        meyna i:r-meyna jerey
        one month-two months passed
        ‘so seeing today seeing tomorrow just like this one - two
        months passed.’

         by me this work neg-do happen
         ‘by me this work cannot be done’.
         [be- < beṭhe : loss of second syllable, + assimilation]   A few verbs have varying forms between their imperative form
and in different tenses. For instance, the verb e:r- ‘to go’, in its
imperative form is eṛe; while in other tenses will have e:r-. (See
below for details).
66                       The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyVerbless constructions, where adjectives like masto ‘good’, backa
‘small’, kemti ‘less’, etc. function as predicate adjectives.:(89)(a) jo masto ‘I (am) fine’ vs. jo masto beṭhe ‘I (am) not fine’     (b) himanso masto ‘this man (is) good’ (vs. masto manso ‘good
          man’ NP),     (c) enge a:wa:r backa ‘my house (is) small’ vs. (vs. backa
          a:wa:r ‘small house’ NP)     (d) eṭey u:nca ma:nso ‘he (is) tall person’ vs.
          eṭey ma:nso u:nca-(ka) ‘that person (is) tall’     (e) hipirjo kho:bo dima:g ‘this girl (is) very intelligent’  Even a noun can function as a predicate, in a possessive
construction, as in the following:(90)(a) ra:m-ki biḍi:-ka bakko
        ram-to one-only hand
        ‘ram (has) one-only hand’     (b) hi-pustak-kon da:m kemti
         this-book-pos price less
         ‘this book’s price (is) less’.","[74, 75, 76, 77]"
"    In the above constructions each positive construction has been
provided with the negative counterpart as well. It will be seen that in
many tenses not only the same negative form is used (except in past
tense); but even tense markers are not used in all negative
constructions (c, d, e above).
(93) Another paradigm: ie:r ~ e:r ‘to go’:
        ne eṛe ‘you go’(imp.)

       jo sokra ṭye-ya-ḍa:n ‘I had eaten food’
       jo sokra ṭye-ya-ken ‘I will eat food’ (khaavunga)
       jo sokra ṭye-ya-kena ‘I will eat food’
       jo sokra ṭye-ya-kiḍani ‘I am now eating’
       jo sokra ṭye-ya-kiḍani-ḍa:n ‘I have been eating’
       jo sokra ṭye-ya-ka-ḍa:n ‘I was eating food’.(95)   me:r- to play’:
       me:r-kini-ḍa:n ‘was playing’
       kappo-kini-ḍa:n ‘was sleeping’(96)   ne pya ‘you go’ (imp.)

future. While the present tense is –ka, past tense is marked by –i;
and the future tense marker is –ken. In present tense –ka is used.

        book to me’)
       -ka is used as a present tense marker and as definiteness
        marker as well.     (b)   eṭey bekaṭa:rki jo:rda:r ba:ro:ka

         ‘this horse runs fast’   But in a negative sentence, the tense marker –ka is not used; and
the negative form beṭhe is placed before the verb itself.(98) (a) ro:jo jo beḍe-beḍe rupya beṭhe okki

"3.7.5. Moods: Modal distinctions are very few in this speech
variety. There are only indicative mood, which is unmarked,
imperative mood, marked by –be, in positive construction, and biji
in negative construction; and interrogative mood. As interrogative
74                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularywords occur very close to the verb in a construction, it has been
considered as a modal distinction. Still, it has been treated
separately. So, except for these three moods, no finer distinctions
are available.(i). Imperative verbal construction is marked by the suffix –be added
to the bare verb root.(107)(a) ne pejko-be ‘you run’

convey imperativeness. For instance, ne eṛe ‘you go’ (sg.) (> ne:ṛe).

imperativity.","[84, 85]"
"   In this speech form adjectives are not derived as such. However,
negative form beṭhe can be used as a prefix with some of the
adjectives to obtain negative adjectives. Interestingly here only a
prefix is used in this way. Some examples will make it clear.:(152) bhum ‘sharp’(e.g.knife) vs. bebhum ‘dull’(knife)
      nitto ‘sharp’(e.g.knife) vs. benitto ‘blunt’ (knife)
      ho:si ‘consiousness’     vs. beho:si ‘unconsciousness’
      diso ‘visible’           vs. beddiso ‘not visible’
      ḍhang ‘proper’           vs. beḍhang ‘useless’.",[105]
"Korku also has many negative forms. They are the following: heba,
ban, ḍun/ḍuka, athika, baw, baki and bangon. (For details Nagaraja,
1999). These markers do not show any formal similarity with the
Nihali forms. However their placement is very much similar to the
Nihali forms. They either precede or follow the verb concerned.
Secondly, in both the languages when the negative marker is used,
tense marker is not used.",[153]

When they join, it becomes bam-maka. It is a possible construction,
though not very frequently used. It is used to connect two clauses.

           enjoy, spent all the money’   In the following illustration, the subordinate clause precedes the
main clause. The structure of the subordinate clause is somewhat
changed compared to the main clause, in that the object occurs after
the verb; while in main clauses the object occurs before the verb.
Also in this case the subormindate clause and the main clause are
connected by a particle kay. However, this kind of construction is
not very common.(226) jo e:riḍa:n eṭeyna a:wa:rki / kay/ eṭey a:wa:rki beṭhe ḍa:n

as in the following:

        when rain coming forest blue-blue appears
        ‘when rain is coming forest looks green’.
Here jab of Hindi which is a subordinator has been used. The
subordinate clause precedes the main clause.","[133, 134, 135, 136, 137]"
"    The grammatical analysis and description are carried out within the model
of modern American Structural linguistics. Establishment of functional
sounds, their contrasts, distribution and allophones together with syllable
structure form the description of phonology. The term grammar comprises the

from elicited data and texts. Under noun morphology person, number, gender

of verb-structure reveals the unique structural patterns of Nihali. The original
analysis is supported by nearly 250 phrases, clauses and sentences, each point
dwelling and dealing with structural nuances. Dr.Nagaraja’s Nihali Language:
Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary is a landmark of his years of linguistic
fieldwork on different minor, neglected and tribal languages. He has firsthand
experience of working on Austroasiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Dravidian group
of languages. One may recall his earlier grammatical treatises on Khasi, Korku

          kappo-kini-ḍa:n ‘was sleeping’Past perfect construction is obtained by adding –ḍa:n to the past

are used. While the first one is used in non-past constructions, the
second one is used in past constructions. However this distinction is
not always followed. Also, frequently the negative marker precedes
the verb; while it may even follow the verb in a construction. (For
more details see 3.7.6.).","[83, 84]"

simple clauses, but without the agent overtly expressed; but
connected by connector ‘and’. Actually all are potentially simple
sentences. As this instance is taken from a text (narration), the agent

the first clause the object is mentioned first, as in (kay) eṭeynaka

clauses, containing only the verbs concerned, like : ḍo wocoli2 ḍo

ones are in past tense.","[130, 131]"

expectation. It occurs before the verb in a construction.(119)(a)   eṭey aju hayom pa:ṭo

           'he even now did not come'.

          ‘I have not seen your wife yet.’biji: This form functions as a negative imperative marker, as
stated above. As can be observed, it can pecede or follow the verb.
When it precedes the verb, it sometimes undergoes some
assimilatory changes; while when it occurs after the verb no such
assimilation takes place.(120)(a) a:pabiji ‘don’t weep’. Or: ne biji ṭye ‘you don’t eat’

"   The most affected area is the Nihali phonology. The present
structure is such that it almost has become bland, and so similar to
other families of the area in many structural aspects. It was
indicated in the previous sections that vowel length and aspiration
are secondary; so their presence can be directly attributable to IA
languages. Similarly the retroflex series is very unstable, indicating
the possibility of it being non-native. Though at present these
speakers live away from the Dravidian communities like Gondi or
Kolami; probably they must have had some contact with them for
some considerable time before. Of course it is also possible that
130                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularysome of these features might have entered through the neighbouring
and alternate (Munda) language, particularly Korku. As most Nihals
live in close proximity to Korkus, and most of them are bilinguals in
Korku this is very likely.
4.1. The vowel system is simple, almost in line with Munda
languages like Korku. The morphemes are predominantly open
(vowel ending); seldom have initial or final consonant clusters. The
syllabic structure is mainly of CVCV type.
   There are no unusual features which can be considered to be
peculiar to this language. So, no checked sounds which are found in
Munda languages (even though Korku has lost this feature). Lexical
items are quite different from Korku or any other language; even
though some losses can be observed. Pronouns, demonstratives,
interrogatives, negatives, tense, aspect markers are all different as
compared to other languages. A list of two-hundred common words
has been given at the end of this section comparing Korku forms.
This will provide important lexical differences.","[140, 141]"

three types based on the number of main clauses it contains. It has
been noticed that speakers of this speech form either use either only
118                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyactive voice or impersonal voice; but seldom use passive voice.
Also, very simple constructions are noted. If a sentence has single
main clause, then it is a simple sentence. Most of the illustrations so
far have been of this type. The second type is that which contains
two main clauses either connected by a connector or without it, is
called compound sentence. See below for illustration. The third type,
which is called complex sentence, contains one main clause and one
or more subordinate clauses embedded with in the main clause. The
subordinate clauses are obtained by converting a main clause by use
of a subordinator element, discussed below. (i) Simple sentences: Already quite a few illustrations have been
provided for this type. So, a few examples for simple sentences are
provided here, which illustrate the word order, etc.:(206)(a) tembrya dongor-ki bhum-ka
         tiger     forest-in walk-prs
         'tiger walks in the forest'.      (b) la   kaṭamkika kamayhona
          you(pl.) silently do-need
          ‘you (pl.) silently should do the work’(ii) Compound sentences: Compound/Coordinate sentences are
made up of two or more main clauses conjoined by an overt or
covert connector. Though normally three subtypes are identified
among the connectors, coordinate connector ḍo ‘and’ is more
common than others. The others are pine/i, pani, okon ‘but’, sorka:n
‘even then’, baken ‘otherwise’, etc.(i) ḍo ‘and’:
(207)(a) biḍi-bakko-ki lakri ḍo biḍi-bakko-ki kanḍil koya…

"   Also, for ‘first’ instead of the above number ‘one’, a totally
different form ceyni is used. It means both ‘first’, ‘previous’ as well
as ‘before/preceding’, depending upon the context.:(78)(a) eṭey ceyni cergoki jita:ya
        he first running-in won
        ‘he succeeded in the very first attempt’.     (b) jo ceyni pa:ṭi

        ‘once a man had killed a tiger’    (b) jo daccophera cergi
        I ten times run-pt
        ‘I ran ten times’3.7. VERBS3.7.0. General remarks: In this language verbal structure is very
simple. Normally verbs occur after the noun phrase(s) in a sentence.
In other words, verbal structure ends a sentence. The verbal
structure normally consists of the verb root+tense +/ aspect marker
only. So, the verbal morphology though agglutinative in nature, is
quite simple. While three-way tense distinction is available, only
two aspectual distinctions are noted; and moods are not very
complex. There are only indicative mood, which is unmarked,
imperative mood and interrogative mood. So, except for these three
moods, no finer distinctions seem to be available.
   On the whole a verb is capable of taking verbalizer/infinitve
marker –be. However all verbs do not take it. Particulalry
intransitive verbs like imni ‘be’, ulta:y ‘fall’, harp- ‘lose’, ola(y)-
‘be wet’, pya-/pak- ‘come’, cark- ‘fall’, doksa- ‘flow’, etc. Most of
the transitive verbs are capable of taking infinitive marker.
   Though this language agrees with all other languages of the area
in word order (like Indo-Aryan, Dravidian or Munda), verbs do not
take any agreement markers. From that point of view it is very
different from them.
60                      The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary   A noun can function like a verb, by taking verbal forms, such as
kamay ‘to do’ or jere(y) ‘to happen’ or ca(:)ka- ‘to climb’ readily
converts a foreign word into a native one. Native verbs do not take
any of them mentioned above, they are inherently verbs, while
others need one of the above mentioned forms for their
verbalization. For instance: kama(y) is the most common form,
which also functions as an independent verb, but functions as an
auxiliary when occurs with another verb or converts a
noun/adjective into a verb. Further it is used with intransitive verb
to obtain transitive form of it (see below for it). For instance:(80)(a) kamay: pata:r ‘dry’ : pata:r-kamay +-be = pata:rkambe ‘to
        dry (cloth)’,
        ila:j ‘treatment’: ila:j-kamay + -be = ila:jkambe ‘to treat
        some one’,
        ulṭa ‘up side down’: ulṭa-kamay +-be = ulṭakam-be ‘to
        cause to fall’, etc.;     (b) jere(y) ‘to happen’: dil ‘heart’: dil-jere ‘to heart move’,
         gelti ‘mistake’ :   gelti-jere-be ‘to commit mistake’
         kama:y ‘work’ : kama:y-jere-be ‘to do the work’     (c) ca(:)ka ‘to climb’: ja:ra-cakay ‘fever climbed’
        khi:jo ‘anger’:      khi:jo-cakay ‘anger climbed’
        a:rsa ‘lazyness’:    a:rsa-cakay ‘lazyness came’, etc.","[69, 70, 71]"
"(83) Incomplete verbs: These are incomplete verbs, in the sense
that they do not take all tense/aspect markers. : hona ‘need’, jerey
‘happen’, etc. (a)     hona ‘need’, when used as a verb, it occurs after a noun, with
         or without a negative form. E.g.: (i)     engki hi-ci:jo beṭhe hona okon iṭi-ci:jo hona
62                         The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary           me-to this thing neg need but that thing need
           ‘to me this thing (is) not needed, but that thing (is) needed’ (ii) engki masto ma:nso hona
      me-to good person need
      ‘I want a good person’ (iii) ne:ki na:n hona
       you-to what want
       ‘what do you want?’Verb ‘be’ in present tense is imne/imni; and in past tense ‘ḍa:n’:
When it occurs without a verb, ḍa:n functions as an independent
verb, marking existence; and used more in past tense (particularly in
narrations); while when it occurs after a verb, it functions as an
auxiliary/aspectual marker.:(84)(a) eṭla a:wa:rki imne
        they house-in be
        ‘they are at home’     (b)  aju masto te:mo imne

         ‘now is the good time’

"   It can be observed from above list, the negative form beṭhe > be-,
by retaining onlythe initial CV- and dropping the second syllable
completely. In some cases there is some assimilation with the
following consonant of the root.",[105]
"   I started taking interest on this language way back in 80s and 90s of
last century when I used to teach a course in Languages of South Asia in
which Nihali was also included. But at that time very little information on
the language was available except for Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya’s paper
based on a field trip in fifties of the same century. All other works
belonged to much earlier periods. Naturally I wanted to work on this
language. After completing work on Korku, I decided to work on Nihali.
The first fieldtrip was conducted in 1996 to locate the speakers of this
language. After locating the speakers every year I used to make short
visits to the areas and collect some data and compare the same with the
previous data to ascertain whether it is really same or different from them.",[6]
"    Nihali texts represent the narratives dealing with several aspects of tribal
life including the traditional knowledge, life style, equality of persons, joy and
sorrow of the people and their philosophy of life. The texts are represented in
phonetic transcription, rather than transliteration, to preserve the spoken style
of the narratives. Each sentence is numbered, with word-to-word meaning and
free translation into English. Nihali lexical items are given in the English
alphabetical order with their meanings on the left side and the source of
borrowing, if any, on the right (in a three-column arrangement).
    Nihali was identified as a separate speech in the mid 1950s by the late
Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya and after a lapse of nearly six decades, the present
volume is the first original detailed study of this endangered language isolate.
It will be of great interest to the students and scholars of Linguistics,
Anthropology, Folklore, Lexicography, Education and Language Planning.
Dr.Nagaraja deserves the appreciation of academic community for his
unceasing seminal linguistic fieldwork and language analysis, with untiring
commitment.",[5]
"4.2.12. Conclusion: The above limited comparison clearly shows
that Nihali is not similar to Korku. Though from the point of
structural considerations, there is some similarity. But beyond that
no similarity can be found. This dissimilarity probably prompted
Bhattacharya in 1954 itself to consider it as a non-Munda language.
The present description clearly supports his contention. In this
language verbal structure is very simple. Normally verbs occur after
the noun phrase(s) in a sentence. In other words, verbal structure
ends a sentence. The verbal structure normally consists of the verb
root+tense +/ aspect marker only. So verbal morphology, though
agglutinative in nature, is quite simple. While a three-way tense
distinction is available, only two aspectual distinctions are noted;
and moods are not very complex. There are only three moods, viz.
indicative mood, which is unmarked, imperative mood and
interrogative mood. So, except for these three moods, no finer
distinctions seem to be available.
   Though this language agrees with all other languages of the area
in word order like Indo-Aryan, Dravidian or Munda), verbs do not
154                    The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularytake any agreement elements. From that point of view, it is very
different from them.","[164, 165]"
"   In around five-six villages in that district these speakers are
located, but in small numbers. There is no exclusive village where
these speakers live. Most of them are bilinguals or multi-linguals;
knowing at least Korku, a Munda language of higher social prestige
and having large number of speakers in the area; and/or local
varieties of Marathi/Hindi as well. Most Nihals are landless
labourers, so economically very poor. Because of it, they come in
contact with other language speakers for their own survival. As their
number is quite small, education, which is very recent, has to be
imparted to them through other languages. So, their language has
been influenced very much by Korku and to some extent by other
Chapter 1/ Introduction                                             3languages. Since 1998 yearly some data has been collected on the
language spoken in Buldhana district of north Maharashtra by the
present writer. So far all the villages where Nihals live and speak
the language have been covered. Based on the data, a preliminary
phonemic analysis and a tentative grammatical sketch have been
prepared.
Statistical and Geographical data   Nihali speaking people live in the following villages: Jamod,
Sonbardi, Kuvardev, Chalthana, Ambavara, Wasali and Cicari - all
in Buldhana district and also fairly close to each other. It has been
observed that a few dialectal differences, particularly in the lexicon
have been observed between Kuvardev-Chaltana varieties vs.
Jamod-Sonbardi varieties. Elsewhere not much of variation is found
between these speech forms. In the following description general
features of Nihali language will be discussed.","[13, 14]"
"    The fourth chapter, with a question whether Nihali is an Isolate,
the answer being that it is an isolate. Here this speech form has been
compared with Korku, which being very close to it physically as
well as most of the speakers are bilingual in it. As no other language
has any chance of being comparable as they are very different from
it, and Korku’s influence on it is most significant; an attempt has
been made in this chapter to compare them taking various aspects
and prove that it is not in any way connected to Korku. Also a list of
so-called two hundred basic wordlist has been provided for both the
languages. In addition, comparable wordlist has been provided
from Mundari, a close relative of Korku, which will serve the
purpose of indicating the relationship with Korku. This hopefully
supports the claim that Nihali is not related to Munda languages. No
attempt has been made to identify whether each comparable set is
native or borrowed. It has been left for the readers’ judgment to
decide on the closeness.",[16]
"   The above comparative table provides some interesting facts
about the possible closeness between Nihali and Korku. Out of two
hundred word list above, more than half are different between them.
Even without going into the statistics, it becomes quite clear that
they are not related from lexical point of view as well. When similar
comparison is carried out between Nihali and Dravidian languages
like Gondi, which was probably spoken in that area some time back;
we find many lexical items similar between them. This aspect
probably indicates to the fact that either Nihals lived for some time
with Gondi speaking people before reaching the present settlements.
Their oral literature does not reveal this aspect. Probably more
intensive work on their language and culture might reveal these
aspects.

156   The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary
                         NIHALI TEXTSThe texts are presented in fairly phonetic transcription, though some
extent of phonemicization has taken place. For instance, length is
indicated wherever observed; but keeping narrator’s pronunciation
into account, an attempt has been made to keep editing to a
minimum; so that the text is as far as possible as it is narrated. So,
length and nasalization are marked even though they are not
phonemic in the language, to facilitate accurate pronunciation. Also,
a given word may have length in one place, but may not show it in

glosses have been given subscripts for easy reference; however, it
may be noted that they themselves do not have any significance.","[165, 166, 167, 168]"
"   The second section provides 8 texts with grammatical
identifications, at times taking phrases into consideration, using sub-
scripts to mark them for easy matching; followed by summary
meaning.",[16]
"   The above three samples provide some insight into the sentence
formation in this speech form, particularly in narrations. These
constructions contain many verbal phrases or simple clauses
connected by the additive coordinator ḍo ‘and’. As could be
observed from above, often the subject will be absent, and even the
object is understood. So the verb finite form is used, which mark
various actions. All are sequentially arranged both chronologically
as well as temporally.(ii) pini/e, pani ‘but’:
(208)(a) pini/e hisaharki joppo kho:b ghaṭajere

"In impersonal constructions, infinitival phrase can occur at the
beginning itself; while in other cases it occurs after the subject of
the matrix clause, as can be seen above.(144)(a) eṭey [ḍongorki caka-caka-ka] cerki
         he     forest/hill climbing     fall-pt
         ‘he [while climbing the hill] fell down’.(iii) Imperative marker is: -be.:

     (c) jo henka ne ṭye:be
          I req. you eat-let ‘please (I request) you eat’(iv) Gerundial constructions are obtained by suffixing a bound form
-ḍone to a verb stem, as can be seen below.:(146)(a) jo bhu:m-ḍone pa:ṭi
          I walk-by come-pt
          ‘I came by walking’

          he house-into weep-by go-pt
          ‘he went home weeping’(v) Temporal clauses indicate the time of action. In this speech
form the verb is reduplicated to express this aspect. For instance, the
verb e:r ‘to go’, by reduplicating it, e:r-e:r ‘go-go’ > ‘while going’,
conveys a sense of duration of action.(146)(a) jo   se        e:r-e:r   enge anga:rkon peṭekamay

"4.2.6. Case: Case is marked by suffixes and/or postpositions. But
'case' is not highly distinctive. Many cases have undergone
syncretization. So, it is in a state of simplification. Nominative case
is unmarked. The first noun phrase in a sentence usually will be in
this case. If it is followed by another NP, it will be in accusative
case. Here, if the object is animate, then it is marked by the case
suffix. If the NP is inanimate, no case marker is used with it. In case
of animate NPs, human nouns take -n as the suffix, while non-
human nouns take -na as the suffix. For examples, see below.
Instrumental, dative and locative cases are marked by using the
same overt case suffix, -ki. Ablative and sociative cases are marked
by the use of the suffix (or postposition) -gon. (eṭey-gon 'from/with
him').

quite different from Nihali system. Though both use suffixes
(loosely put), the elements as such except for sociative case, others
are very different. In both quite a bit of syncretization has taken
place. But the syncretization is independent to each language, so
differences are observed. In Nihali instrumental, dative and locative
have merged into one, ablative and sociative have merged into one,
and accusative and possessive have merged into one. So, effectively,
only three distinctions can be observed. On the other hand, in Korku
instrumental and ablative have merged into one, and dative and
locative have merged into one. So here syncretization is relatively
less as compared to the Nihali situation. Both the languages use
postpositions to some extent.","[150, 151]"
"Reduplication of verbs in the above way is a common method of
obtaining temporal clauses. (More on reduplication will be
discussed in the section on Reduplication, 3.11.).",[102]
"3.1. Morphological processes
3.1.1. Affixation: In affixation mainly suffixation is employed in this
speech form. Prefixation is used marginally in adjectives section.
Infixation is almost not used at all. Suffixation is used to derive
agentive and other types of nouns from verbs, etc. For instance the
suffix –re is used to obtain agentive nouns from verbs and non-
agentive nouns. For instance:(1)(a) saykal ‘cycle’ + -re >       saykal-re ‘cycle rider’
       maw ‘horse’ + -re >          maw-re ‘horse rider’
       cana ‘dance’ + -re >         cana-re ‘dancer’
       pahun ‘guest’ + -re >        pahun-re ‘guest’ (one)
       jam ‘to buy’ + -re           jam-re ‘buyer’
(1)(b) ḍhol-be ‘to beat drum’ + -re > ḍhol-be-re ‘drummer’
                                    (ḍhol ‘drum’, be- ‘to beat’)
       asuḍ-be ‘to swing’ + -re > asuḍre ‘swinger’
                                    ( = one who swings)
       baro-be ‘to sing’+-re        baro-bi-ka-re ‘singer’Another suffix –hela means ‘all’ can be added to nouns to obtain
agentive nouns in plural.:(2)(a) biya ‘village’ + -hela >     biyahela ‘villagers’
       basel ‘child’ + -hela >      baselhela ‘children’
28                     The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary       pahun ‘guest’ +-hela >        pahunhela ‘guests’There is another suffix, –ji used to derive nouns from verbs,
adjective, etc. It provides a sense of thing/object used for a purpose.
For instance, a verb like ceki- ‘to hold’ + ji > cekiji ‘tongs’ (= that
which is used to hold something). But this method is not very
productive, as only a few instances of this type are available. They
are listed below:(b) ceki ‘to hold’ + -ji > cekiji ‘tongs’
    cacom ‘to taste sweet’ + -ji > cacomji ‘sweet things’
    aranga ‘to become stale (food)’ + -ji > aranga:ji ‘stale
    food’(left over)
Obviously this method needs to be explored further.","[38, 39]"
"   The Nihali language has great significance, due to its uniqueness,
in not having any known relationship with any known language. In
this regard Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya had conducted a fieldtrip in
1954-55. After that, though some data was collected from the
Nahals of Buldhana district of Maharashtra, in the sixties of
previous century under the Munda project, it came to light only in
1996, in the form of Nihali lexicon published in a Journal called
Mother Tongue in the USA. Other than that, no scholar had shown
any interest in this language. In order to fill this vacuum in 1996 a
pilot study was conducted by the present scholar to ascertain where
these speakers are living. That fieldtrip was successful in locating
these speakers, in a place called Jamud, and in the neighboring areas
in Buldhana district of Maharashtra. There are not many villages
where this language is spoken.",[13]
"   There are a few problematic as well as doubtful cases, which
need to be clarified at a later date. Some of them have been
indicated by a question mark. The present data has been collected
from a few nearby villages. Various texts have been collected by
different speakers. A few dialectal features have been noted. Here
no attempt has been made to provide an exhaustive statement
regarding dialectal differences. That will be for the future work.",[260]

character; but it is simple. Not too many affixes get joined to a base
form. The roots of the language are primarily disyllabic with vowel
ending, though some consonant ending roots are possible. The
common canonical structure of a root is- CVC(C)V(C).
Morphological processes employed in this language are: affixation
(generally suffixation only (but potentially also infixation among
demonstratives only), compounding and reduplication.","[37, 38]"

preservation of many terms in Nihali. In Nagaraja (2008), this topic
has been discussed in some detail. From that it becomes clear that
though some forms are similar to Korku, (due to proximity of the
Korku people), many forms are different. Here, the adjectives for
‘small/young’ is backa-, and for big/elder’ is bha:ga-. Also, there is
a term gita meaning ‘younger sibling’, male or female. Such
Chapter 4 / Is Nihali, an Isolate?                               143
common terms are very few. In this language also, similar to Korku,
a distinction is made between ‘self’s’ and ‘other’s’. The marker is -
ja to indicate ‘self’s’ whereas the other is unmarked. However, its
range needs to be ascertained.","[153, 154]"
"There is another form –ki which is used in imperative sense, though
not frequently. Its distribution is not clear. For instance, a statement
like hi pustakkon da:m kemti ‘the price of this book (is) less’ can be
converted into an imperative (request ?) one by suffixing –ki at the
end of the sentence, as :
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                                 75
(108) hi pustakkon da:m kemti-ki ‘reduce the price of this book’.","[85, 86]"
"Also, instead of pine, another form okon can be used to express this
concept.:

"3.9. Adverb(ial)s: The adverbs are those which normally modify a
verb in a sentence or construction. There are different types of
adverbs; like manner, time or temporal adverbs, place adverbs
which function more like nouns; and frequency adverbs. Most of
them are quite free in their occurrence. The following forms have
been found to be used in this function.(a) Manner adverbs: Though manner adverbs in this speech form
do not take any marker as such, still some of them take a form –ki
Chapter 3 / Grammar                                              95with them. Using it with adjectives, some adverbs are obtained.
Other than –ki, they are not morphologically marked. Only by the
place of their occurrence they are identified as such. They normally
occur preceding the main verb in a sentence. But they can occur
much before the verb, or even after a verb, as will be seen below.
Following are some of the manner adverbs.: geyra:-ki ‘slowly’,
jaldi-ki ‘fast’, masto-ki ‘nicely/beautifully’, jhaṭ-ka ‘all of a
sudden’, baro:bar ‘properly’, bageteka ‘silently’, marṭhay-ki ‘after
longtime’, etc.","[105, 106]"
