4.6 NEGATION OF PREDICATIONS
   Negation of predications in Korafe is usually signalled by the combination of the
negative focus marker jo 'not' and the stem I form of the terminal verb with the negative
de verbal ae 'not doing' at its terminus. The copula ri follows the negative deverbal,
indicating an event that has occurred prior to the speech-act moment, but it does not specify
any time frame (e.g. today's past, near past, etc.).
4.85   Na jo       ning-ae=ri.
       I S NEG hear.I-not.do=COP.AQ
       ' I didn't hear (what was said). '
If i t is important to link the non-occurrence of a n event to a specific time frame, the
negative deverbal precedes an appropriately inflected form of the verb e 'do', functioning
like a nominal complement to the verb e 'do ' . Example 4.86 with a today ' s past tense form
and 4.87 with a present tense form are commonly used.
4.86   Na jo      ning-ae+e-teni.
       I S NEG hear.I-not.do+dO.l-TP. I S.AQ
       'I didn't hear (what was said just now).'
4.87   Na jo      ning-ae+er-ena.
       I S NEG hear. I-not.do+IPF-do.PRES. I S.FN
       'I do not hear (what is being said).'
If the non-occurrence of an event is projected, a future form of e 'do' must follow the
deverbal.
4.88   Na jo        ning-ae+arena.               Ning-ari imboe+er-ira.
       I S NEG hear.I-not.do+do.F.I S.FN hear. I-DVB dislike+IPF-do.PRES.3S.FN
       ' I will not listen. I don't want to listen (to what I believe will be said) . '
   If the speaker wants t o focus o n the negation o f a constituent other than the verb, he or
she may place jo before that constituent. In example 4.89, it precedes the instrumental
argument.
4.89   Ghaka=mo,      jQ  asi tefo+tefo        aimi          digh-ae
       canoe=TIF      NEG vine nothing+nothing that.CEFF.TIF tie.I-not.do
       e-raera.
       dO.l-CUST. 1 PL.FN
       ' Outrigger canoes, we don't lash together with just any old vine.'
It is also possible to focus on both a non-verbal constituent and the verbal constituent as
being negated, by positioning a jo before each of the constituents. In example 4.90, the
138     Chapter 4speaker emphasises his main point that not everyone will get into heaven by marking both
isasarnbu 'each and everyone' and the verb.
4.90    Narnonde jQ      isasarnbu utu=da          jQ    y-ae +arera.
        l PL.EXC   NEG all .RED     heaven=LOC NEG go.DUR-not.do+do.F. 1 PL.FN
        'Not each and everyone of us will go to heaven.'
    In negated topic-comment clauses, the copula ri must occur with a deverbal form of iri
' remain' : irae 'not remain' . Examples 4.26a and b, 4.27b and 4.27c in §4.2. 1 illustrate this.
   The verb iri 'remain' can replace the verb e 'do' to indicate that non-accomplishment of
an event is or was or will be a continuing state of affairs.
4.9 1   Ni nange     bayau jo       it-ae+ir-esi?
        2S do.how food NEG cook.I-not.do+remain-PRES.2S.AQ
        ' How come you're just lazing around here without cooking the food?'
   The scope of negation may cover either a single predication or a sequence of
predications within SRCs. Examples illustrating the scope of negation in SRCs can be found
in §6.2.3. The scope of negation cannot extend beyond a final verb, however. Therefore all
bases in co-ranking sentences must be individually negated. In example 4.92, the verb aira
'he went' terminates the predication in the positive sentence base, and the predication in the
subsequent antithetical base is negated.
4.92    Nu nu        karnbo=da a-ira,                     avata        vikoko jQ
        3S SPEC      house=LOC go.NDUR-TP.3S.FN           that.CT.FRUS knife  NEG
        b-ae=ri.
        get. I-not.do=COP.AQ
        ' It is true that he went to the house, but he didn't get the knife.'
   As illustrated in the previous examples, predications that are statements (4.90) and
questions (4.9 1 ) are negated by jo 'not' at the onset and ae ' not do' at the terminus.
Commands are negated by using the negative hortative form of the final verb. The scope of
negation in a command can be optionally marked by placing {era} 'don't' before the initial
constituent to be negated. Examples 4.93a and b illustrate negative prohibitions without and
with {era } .
4.93a. Usu          duru=da   anurnb-eose!    Oroko           usu=i        du-do
       coconut      under=LOC sit-NEG.H.2S.CR today           coconut=CEFF fall.l-SEQ.SS
        d-arira.
        hit.I-F.3S.FN
        ' Don't sit underneath the coconut tree. (If you do,) a coconut will fall down and
        hit you now. '
4.93b. Usu         duru=da      era anurnb-eose!
       coconut under=LOC NEG sit-NEG.H.2S.CR
       ' Don't sit underneath the coconut tree. '
Other examples involving negative hortative forms may be found i n §2.4.2 . 1 1 , §2.S.2.6,
and §7.2.2.2.
                                                       Clauses. predicates. predications and sentences       1 394.7 SIMPLE SENTENCES
   Korafe simple sentences are minimally composed of one base with accompanying
prosodies. 1 7 Sentence bases correspond syntactically to the clauses and semantically to the
predications outlined in this chapter, and have either P I SOY or P I :TOPIC-COMMENT
constituent structure.
   In simple sentences with P I SOY constituent structure, the verb must be an independent
final verb, and those with P I :TOPIC-COMMENT structure must terminate with the copula
(ri). The maximal constituent structure of Korafe simple sentences can be represented by
one of the following two structures:
       Periphery P2:THEME, PI SOY, P3:TA IL or
       Periphery P2:THEME, P I :TOPIC COMMENT, P3:TAIL,
where P I and P3 are NPs or PPs, not clauses.
    Modal particles that attach to the verb or the copula at the terminus of the base encode
epistemic and evaluative modalities. Epistemic particles include: asi 'that was said (quoted
speech or strongly asserted by the speaker)' , tana 'possibly' , and tanaja 'perhaps, maybe
so, maybe not'. Evaluative particles are: ta 'I, the speaker, am frustrated or annoyed', vae
'I, the speaker, am extremely annoyed to the point of anger' , { ere } 'this material is
immediately relevant to our present situation'. Example 4.94 illustrates the use of the
epistemic modal particle, asi 'that was said'.
4.94    Nundae       si-seni,            ""Fu,               nanda dengesi=da
        3S.BEN       say. I I-DP. I S.AQ come.DUR.IMP.2S.AQ I S.GEN sid e=LOC
        iJarata+as=asi!      ""        dock.lengthwise+do .H.2S=that. say .II
        ' I said to him, ""Come, and dock next to me,"" that was said.
The epistemic particles tana 'possibly' and tanaja 'perhaps' convey two grades of doubt
about the situation, the former expressing more of a possibility. They are often used in
sentences in conjunction with avase 'perhaps, I just don't know (lit. that.CT.say.n)"" which
occurs as an initial peripheral segment or follows the thematic entity, as example 4.95
illustrates.","[157, 158, 159]"
"12       In SVcs verbal predicates must lie within the scope ofjo and the negative deverbal; negation of one
         verbal constituent does not occur withjo. Bases in co-ranking structures must be individually negated.
1 92    Chapter 6   The negative deverbal is a nominal form that is primarily used in SRCs in combination
with an auxiliary verb, either e 'do' or iri ' remain' . The auxiliary e 'do' is used to encode a
sequencing temporal relationship between marking and reference clauses, and a form of iri
'remain' encodes a simultaneous or overlap temporal relationship between the two clauses.
   In example 6.21 with the SS medial form of the auxilary verb edo 'do ' , both the marking
clause with the negated segment and the reference clause coreference the same referent as
their subject.
6.2 1    . . . a jo      tumond-ae        e-do         nundae jijivu+s-eteri.
        that NEG believe-not.do do. I -SS.SEQ 3S .BEN swearing+say-TP .3PL.AQ
        , . . . they did not believe that, and they swore at him.'
A sequencing relationship marked by etiri 'he did and' also obtains between the marking
and reference clauses in example 6.22, but the marking clause with its DS medial verb form
differs from the reference clause as to its subject referent.
6.22    . . .jo totoi       fu-r-ae           e-tiri,         evetu nu kote-tira . . .
            NEG quickly come-(r)-not.do dO.I-SEQ.R.3S .DS woman 3 S think.I-TP.3S .FN
        ' . . . he didn't come (back) quickly, and the woman thought. . . '
Overlap or simultaneous relationships are conveyed by the negative deverbal in conjunction
with a medial form of iri ' remain' (6.22).
6 .23   Na nange      yaru eni gat-ae              ir-eno               at-eti?
        I S do.what.I song a      select.r-not.do remain-SIM.R. l S .DS dawn-TP.3S .AQ
        ' How come I remain not having selected any song while it has already dawned?'
The negative focus marker jo is missing from the above example; just the negative deverbal
gatae 'not select' occurs. When there is a strong possibility that the non-event can be
reversed, the jo can be omitted. The speaker selected a song and sang it immediately after
the words given in example 6.23 were uttered.
   The combination (negative deverbal + iri medial form) provides a strategy for
circumventing the iconic order restriction that SRCs adhere to. It is acceptable to say in
Korafe, while x still remained not having happened, before that . . In example 6.24, a
                                                                         .simultaneous medial form is j uxtaposed with a temporal conj unction that encodes
anteriority.
6 .24   John jo  siror-ae    lr-/Tl              ainda         giti=da,
        John NEG born-not.do remain-SIM.R.3S .DS that.CEFF.GEN initial.part=LOC

        3s.mother poison bad true          find.u-DP.3S.FN
        ' Before John was born, his mother was very sick. (lit. While John was remaining
        not born, before that, his mother encountered very bad poison.)'
I do not have a good explanation for why a simultaneous medial form can be juxtaposed
with an anterior conj unctive expression. Certainly the enduring state of affairs conveyed by
jo sirorae iriri 'while he remained not having been born' totally overlaps with the mother' s
period o f illness. Perhaps the temporal conjunction is used because i t is relating the time of
                                                                                     SRCs   1 93the mother's illness to John's birth, which is certainly a reality at the speech act encoding
time.
    In examples 6.2 1 , 6.22, 6.23 and 6.24 above, the scope of negation does not extend
beyond one clause. Contrasting with them, examples 6.25 and 6.26 contain SRCs in which
several, but not all, bases share a negative polarity. In each case, the negative SRC is linked
at its negative deverbal terminus to a base in another SRC, which does not have negative
polarity. As 6.25 illustrates, the negative SRC terminating with the deverbal form gae 'not
see' is linked to irise 'while remaining' and linked by irise to the other SRC which
terminates with the final verb dadabetira 'it finished' . The latter SRC has realis status, but
the negative SRC, which is underlined, has irrealis status.","[211, 212, 213]"

         happened (back to b) or the young children who are growing up after it
         happened, (back to a) we will tell them the account and they will hear (it).'
SRC (a) is broken off at the DS simultaneous medial verb form of se ' speak: siruroro 'while
we will be speaking' . It is resumed at the sequencing form of se: saoro ' we will speak'. SRC
(a) has irrealis status. SRC (b) begins at edo 'and '. It has realis status, as the final verb
babojerera 'they are growing' indicates. The negative SRC (c) intervenes between edo and
etero in S RC (b); it terminates with ningae 'not hear', which is linked to etero in SRC (b).
The medial verb foa 'they will come' is interpreted as sharing the negative polarity and
irrealis status of ningae.
   In a number of examples, the entire SRC is negated up until the final auxiliary verb e 'do'
or iri ' remain' or the copula ri, which is the final constituent in the sentence. The negated
verbs in example 6.27 include: mutoro 'we will [not] give' , budo ' (you) will [not] get' , and
yae 'not go' ; the final verb areva 'you will do' terminates the SRC.

                                                                                           SRCs   1 95   A number of SRCs that occur with a negated segment are structurally problematic in one
of three ways: ( 1 ) mismatches between the syntax and the semantics of some lexically fixed
verb sequences that are negated, (2) the occurrence of the negative deverbal without an
auxiliary or copula in SRCs, and (3) the occurrence of copular constituents of SRCs.
(1)     A mismatch occurs between the syntax and semantics o f some lexically fixed verb
        sequences, such as 'hit(x,Y)-die(Y)', when they are a negated segment within an SRC.
        The scope of negation invariably extends over both verbs in such fixed sequences.
        Thus, the jo ' not' precedes a DS future medial form that is syntactically positive and
        semantically negative, and the negated segment terminates at the negative deverbal
        which is syntactically negative and semantically positive. In example 6.29, the
        focused element is the subject nane ' 1 ' , so jo precedes it. The negated segment
        terminates with the verb ambae 'not die ' .
6.29     Jo     nane      d-aono                 amb-ae=ri.
         NEG I S .ACT hit.I-SEQ.lR. I S . DS die .I-not.do=COP.AQ
         ' It wasn't I that killed him. (lit. (It was)n't I I hit (him) and he did not die.)'
Even though daono 'I will hit' is morphologically positive, the reality is that the speaker
did not perform the 'hitting' action. And even though ambaeri ' he did not die' is morpho­
logically negative, someone really did die.
(2)     The negative deverbal sometimes occurs without an auxiliary verb (see § 5 .3 . 1 ). When
        the negative deverbal is not followed by a pause, the structure it terminates can in
        most instances be considered to have a manner adverbial role in the clause. However,
        there are a few cases in which the negative deverbal occurs without an auxiliary and
        is followed by a pause, as in example 6.30.
6.30     Nunda saramana jQ          ilil.,  nu do         sumb-ira.
         3S .GEN work         NEG not.do 3S leave.l run.l-TP.3S .FN
         ' She didn't do her work, and she has left and run (away).'
This negative construction could be considered to be an SRC base, which is missing the S S
sequencing form edo. Or it could be treated a s a negative construction with the copula
missing, because it occurs intrasententially. (The copula always indicates assertions;
therefore, it usually occurs sentence-finally.) The sans copula analysis seems quite possible
for example 6.29, because the construction is the initial constituent in the sentence. The
construction could be interpreted to be a co-ranking sentence, rather than an SRC.
  However, in example 6.3 1 the negative construction seemingly occurs as a base
constituent in the middle of an SRC.

                                                 '
It does seem preferable to interpret this negative construction as an SS constituent of an
SRC, less sharply defined temporally than it would be with the medial verb edo. It should be
noted that this particular pattern usually precedes the verbs dodo ' leaving off and jaredo
'despairing of . Where edo is overtly present, as in example 6.3 1 , the two events are
complementary, one flowing into the other. Both examples 6.29 and 6.30 encode a sharp
contrast, in fact a change of direction. The sans copula option is not favoured here, because
copular clauses are not normally constituents of SRCs.
(3)    However, Korafe does have some exceptional instances of S RCs in which copular
       constructions do appear to be SRC constituents, as in 6.32.
6.32    Ebe=mane aya=da           enda gov-use,
        uncle=PL    mother=GEN land plant.I l-SrM.SS

        I have not gone and planted gardens together with them
        'While (my) uncles have been planting mother' s land, (it) is (the case that)
        they haven't invited me to go and plant (gardens) along with them. '
Although I cannot explain the linking of a copular clause with a clause predicated by a
medial verb, this is the way the facts appear to be. The medial verb govuse ' while they are
planting' , does not fall under the scope of negation. In fact, the clause it terminates appears
to be coordinated in an SRC with the 'clause' the copula ri terminates. The underlined SRC
with negative polarity commences at the negative focus marker jo, and terminates at govae
'not plant' . The entire SRC bracketed by markers of negation is a predicate nominal unit
connected by the negative deverbal to the copula ri which terminates the sentence.
   Occasionally negation is expressed by SRCs with verbs having negative hortative forms.
For an account of SRCs utilising negative hortative verb forms, see §2.S.2.6 and §7.2.2.2.
The latter section illustrates the use of negative hortative verb forms in negative purpose
constructions.","[213, 214, 215, 216]"
"
6.2.3 OPERATION OF NEGATION IN SRCs
   Of the co-ranking and chaining sentence constructions in Korafe, SRCs are the only type
that allows several negative bracketing options. Negative bracketing structures may be
manifested: ( 1 ) within one clause in the chain, (2) by a few clauses together, or (3) by the
entire lexical series in the chain, other than the auxiliary verb terminating the sentence.
The two markers of negation, namely the negative focus marker jo ' not' and the negative
deverbal : stem I of verbs and ae 'not doing' usually bracket the segment within which
negation holds. 1 2 Each medial verb in the chain defined by the negation markers i s
interpreted as sharing the irrealis status and negative polarity of the negative deverbal
which terminates the chain.",[211]
"
2. 1 . 1 POSITIVE DEVERBAL: STEM [ + ARI-
   The derivational formative -ari combines with stem r of verbs to yield a nominal.
Although deverbalised, this form retains the word stress pattern of verbs, i.e. stress occurs
on the first syllable of the suffix. Distributionally, -ari deverbals occur most often as nouns
heading noun phrases, as example 2.25 illustrates .
2.25   .. .jebuga   seka,   ir-ari           seka,   enda seka      a=va
         life       new     remain-DVB       new     earth    new   that=CT
       namonde      tambu    b-arera.
       I PL.INC         fmd.!  get. I-F. I PL.FN
       ' . . . we will fmd and get that new life, new lifestyle, and new earth.'
Occasionally, these deverbals function as modifiers. In example 2 . 26, digari 'many ' is a
quantifier modifying the noun head, and ambari is an intensifier, modifying digari.
2.26   evetu+genembo dig-ari                  amb-ari        eko
       woman+man           multiply. !-DVB    die. !-DVB bad
       ' lots and lots of people'
    The deverbalisation process may include the original clause (subject, object and verb) in
its entirety. The resultant deverbal construction has a nominal function. In examples 2.27
and 2.28 it functions respectively as the topic of an evaluation and as an object complement
of a speech act or mental process verb.
2.27   John     nune      toro noaro    d-ari=mo,        eko=ri.
       John 3S.ACT self 3 S .wife hiu-DVB=T/F bad=coP.AQ
       ' For John himself to hit his wife would be bad.'
2.28   Mandi koti-sira,              na nombura=i        b-ari=a           koti-sira.
       boy      think. I I-DP.3S.FN 1 S crocodile=CE get. l -DVB=that think.II-DP.3S.FN
                                                                       ,
       ' The boy thought that a crocodile had got me. (But it hadn't.)
2. 1 .2 NEGATIVE DEVERBAL: STEM 1 + -AE
   The derivation formative -ae combines with stem I to form the negative deverbal. It is
primarily used to negate verbal predications, but it also functions like a negative participle
(modifier).
32       Chapter 22.29        Nu mandi semb-ae =ri.
            he boy         cross. I-not.do=COP.AQ
            ' He is a culturally -aberrant boy. '
2.30        Yasivu,      evetu+genembo diti            ir-ae,            daguna, dengoro

            ' Go (and) summon those blind, lame, deaf, and dumb people! '
   The negative deverbal is an essential constituent of all negative predications. The
particle jo 'not' usually precedes the constituent that is the focus of the negation. The
negated segment is terminated by the deverbal, usually in combination with the copula ri
(2.3 1 ), a form of e 'do' (2.32) or a form of iri 'remain' (2.33).
2.3 1       Na nu if!.       J!-ae =ri.

1.6 TYPOLOGY
  Korafe is morphologically agglutinating, primarily hosting suffixes and enclitics. It
exhibits both head-marking and dependent-marking strategies:
                                           head-marking               dependent-marking
                   clauses                 predicates                oblique arguments
                                           auxiliary verbs
                   noun phrases            nouns                     qualifiers
                                                                     possessors
20    In Farr and FaIT ( 1 974:26), this vowel length was interpreted as word tone. And a slight down-glide
      often does accompany the lengthened vowel.
21    There are two other subsidiary rules for the today's past and future tense paradigms that constitute
      exceptions to this general rule. These are: ( I ) stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable when a today's
      past tense verb form has more than two syllables (e.g. seteni 'I said', tendeni ' I lashed', but beni ' I got'),
      and (2) stress perturbs from the initial syllable of the future tense suffix to the second syllable when the
      focused element in the clause is not the verb (e.g. Na yarena ' I will go', Na Tufi yarena ' I will go to
      Tufi. ).
           '
                                                                                Introduction   15   The unmarked order of core constituents i n the clause is subject-object-verb (sov), but
word order of clausal constituents is fairly free with the one stipulation that the verb be last.
In fact, the verb is the only constituent of the clause that obligatorily occurs. Any argument
that is recoverable from the discourse context or the external deictic situation can be elided.
   Korafe distinguishes two major open word classes: nominals and verbs. Nominals
include words that correspond to the categories: noun, qualifier, quantifier, numerator, and
adverb in English. Processes that apply to nominals include inflecting for plurality,
intensity, and/or specific focus, but nominals usually occur without inflections. As is typical
for Papuan languages, verbs are morphologically complex, undergoing agglutinating and
fusional processes which link stems with their corresponding inflections. Verb forms differ
from nominals in the inflectional categories they host, intensification strategies, and the
stress rules that apply to them.
   Closed word classes having referential function in discourse are personal pronouns,
interrogatives/indefinites, and demonstratives-deictics. Other closed word classes include:
postpositions, conjunctions, and sentential focus markers. Interjections, response words and
greetings are numerically limited, but the Korafe repertoire is expanding to include English
interjections and responses.
   Postpositions often cliticise to the preceding noun phrase or sentence base that they
relate to a larger construction or to the discourse deictic context. They function as: ( 1 )
semantic case role markers, (2) markers of pragmatic functions, and (3) modal indicators.
Markers of semantic case roles and pragmatic functions are enumerated, and their
function(s) with noun phrases are specified in Chapter 3. Some combinations of these
postpositions with nominals, personal pronouns, demonstratives, and interrogatives/
indefinites are lexically frozen (e.g. sovenida ' across from' , eloda ' on top of' , ikxida,
dengesida 'beside', all nominals occurring with the general locative postposition da to
specify a position).
   Epistemic and deontic modals terminate sentence bases and left-dislocated themes. The
speaker uses these indicators to declare his or her orientation or attitude towards the deictic
situation detailed. They include: vae 'I'm exasperated', ta ' I ' m annoyed' , lano 'probably
so', tanojo 'perhaps', asi 'certainly (a-si, that-saY.II.evidential indicating reported speech)',
re 'relevant to the immediate deictic situation' and the related demonstrative sets ere, are,
ore which spatially link the event to the speaker, the addressee, or some place away from
both.
   Four personal pronoun stems occur in Korafe: na ' 1 ' , ni 'you' , nu 'he, she,it', and ne
'you (pL)/they' . Frozen combinations of these stems with enclitics are used to make dual
and plural as well as first person inclusive and exclusive distinctions. Only pronominal
stems occur with the actor focus suffix -ne and the limiter -suka 'only ' . The nominal
10/0/1010/0 ' self/selves' is used as a reflexive form or to emphasise the subject in a clause
(which is usually a pronoun). Reciprocal relationships are signalled by t% t% .
   Interrogative and indefinite words arise from four basic stems. Two are basically
pronominal : ave/mave 'who' and re ' what' . The referential specifier -jo (avejo ' who
specifically?') and semantic case role and pragmatic function markers occur with these two
16    Chapter 1pronominal forms. The stem ningi 'which' always combines with forms that are based on
                                                                                          ,
the demonstrative a 'that' (ningia 'which one?'). The verb stem nange 'how (lit. do what)
is the only Korafe verb that may be followed by the comparative postposition go/gao In
content questions, the question word retains the same position in the clause as its
antecedent except in the case of subject where OSV order often occurs.
   All members of the Binandere family manifest the same three-way set of demonstrative
stems: e 'this near the speaker', a 'that near the addressee' , and 0 'that away from both ' .
Markers o f pragmatic functions directly follow demonstratives (amo 'regarding that one',
ava 'that as opposed to any others'). Modal enclitics also occur with the demonstrative set
(amasi 'regarding that certain one'). Semantic case role markers or the pro-verb ge 'do
(FOCUS)' follow one of the pragmatic effector of change markers i or mi (aindae ' on
                                                                          ,
account of that', aminda 'there', aminge 'do thus'). The term 'deictics 22 encompasses the
entire range of demonstrative-based forms.
   Korafe contrasts with some Papuan23 languages in having upwards of 20 conjunctions
and conjunction complexes, which are related to demonstrative forms and/or same-subject
medial verb forms. An inventory of these forms and their functions in co-ranking sentences
is catalogued in Chapter 8. Their function in SRCs is outlined in §6.2.4.
   Sentential focus particles include the negative focus marker jo ' not' , the proposition
specifier nu 'this proposition selected from the available ones', taka 'just, frustratingly' .
Sentential focus words such as avose 'perhaps (lit. that. CT. say)' and avori 'all right (lit.
             ,
that.cT.coP) may also occur in isolation as response words. Other than jo which precedes
the negated constituent in focus, these sentential focus markers either occur sentence­
initially or following the subject and are often set off by pauses from the rest of the
sentence. Tag markers for polar questions (e.g. ai 'yes?', ai tefo 'yes or no?' ) also belong to
this class. However, they are set off at the terminus of the sentence by pauses.
   Interjections (termed yove in Korafe) are a small set of uninflected words and fixed
expressions that the Korafe employ to express emotional reactions (e.g. mara 'what a
shame' , arie ' wow! '). Among the response words and expressions the Korafe use are:
aavori 'that' s sufficient', aii 'yes' , and aiyakoe or tanik yu 'thank you' . Like the sentential
focus particles, interjections and response words may be set off from an accompanying
sentence by pauses; but more normally they are uttered in isolation associated with an
intonation contour that can display considerable pitch variation. Greetings and farewells
(termed ategi in Korafe) occur in isolation or with a vocative expression. The current daily
greeting Sifo eveva! ' Good day ! (lit. day good)' has largely replaced the traditional
greetings using present tense forms of verbs (e.g. /resa! 'You are staying! ' , Refesa! ' You
are coming! ', Ravasi! 'You have slept! '). Command forms of verbs (e.g. Anumbeyo! 'Sit ! ' ,
/yo! ' Go ! ' , A viyo! ' S leep ! ') continue to b e used a s farewells. Interj ections and other
utterances that are shouted at a distance terminate with an -0.","[34, 35, 36]"

relationship with the noun beM 'reality' . Base 2 is composed of two co-ranking bases,
linked by the conjunction a 'and ' . Bases 2a and 2b are each multiclausal SRCs. Base 1
terminates with a copula, and bases 2a and 2b terminate with final verbs.
   Because each base is absolutely grounded, taking the speech act moment as its temporal
and modal reference point, bases in CRSs are not required to share tense, aspect, mood,
polarity, illocutionary force or any arguments. Thus, the copular predicate terminating base
1 in 8 . 1 is realis. but the verbs terminating bases 2a and 2b nested in base 2 have future
irrealis forms. Base 1 has positive polarity in contrast to the latter two bases which each
terminate with a clause having negative polarity.
     Bases in CRSs can be linked to each other by direct juxtaposition, as are bases 1 and 2 in
8 . 1 . Or they can be l inked by mostly demonstrative-based forms that function as
conjunctions and determiners, as bases 2a and 2b in 8. 1 are.
    Sentence bases can be dependent or independent. Only dependent bases can terminate
with a demonstrative determiner, which follows the final predicate in the base and occurs in
the rhythm group associated with the base. The falling-rising intonation pattern associated
with the terminus of dependent bases distinguishes them prosodically from all other bases
in the CRS.
   The syntactic, pragmatic and semantic relationships co-ranking bases have with each
other are the focus of sections ( 1 ) to (3).","[266, 267]"
"
6.2 HOW CLAUSES IN SRCS OPERATE TOGETHER
    Clauses in SRCs are knit together in the following ways:
( 1 ) they occur in a sequence which is isomorphic with the sequence of events they encode;
(2) they can be linked only by those conjunctions which either maintain the temporal
    iconicity of the events they represent or encode alternation or addition of events that
    totally overlap and hence can be reversed;
(3) the verbs predicating them agree in status (realis or irrealis); 6
(4) they share the propositional value (asserted as valid or desirable or neutral with regard
    to assertion) of the terminal clause;
(5) negation can be limited to one clause, or it can extend over several clauses, so any
    number of them can share the same polarity; and
(6) those clauses that are predicated by SS medial verbs share the same subj ect referent;
    argument sharing also may occur between clauses marked with a DS medial verb and
    the following reference clause.
Bonding between medial verbs is also illustrated by instances in which they are gapped.
Bonding between a pair of SRCs at their interface is accomplished by 'tail-head linkage' .
The first five properties as well as gapping and 'tail-head linkage' are explained i n this
section (6.2). Section 6.3 deals with referential tracking.",[201]
"
9.2.2 . 1 NEGATION
   The scope of negation obligatorily extends over both verbs within all standardised clause
sequences. Therefore, the morphemes that bracket negation, jo . . . ae 'not . . . not do' must
bracket both verbs together. The negative focus markerjo 'not' must occur before either the
initial verb or the focused sector of the initial clause along with the verb, as in 9. 1 Sa.
9. 1 Sa. Nu jo        namane s-aoro                   siror-ae =ri.

         ' It wasn' t we that caused him to be born. '
Example 9. 1 Sb is ungrammatical because the negative focus marker jo ' not' does not
precede saoro 'they will say' .
9. l Sb. *Nu namane s-aoro                        jo  siror-ae=ri.

                                               .",[322]
"(5) Realis versus irrealis
   The distinction between realis and irrealis status is clearly defined by the morphological
shape of medial verbs and the distributional restrictions holding between medial verb forms
and the final verb in the chain. If the final verb in a chaining sequence is future, hortative,
customary, counterfactual, negative in polarity, or the auxiliary verb in habitual
26    Chapter 2constructions, the medial verbs that precede it in the SRC must all be irrealis (i.e. future,
customary, or negative hortative) forms. Realis medial verb forms must precede fmal verbs
manifesting the present or a past tense (i.e. today 's, near, yesterday' s, distant, or enduring
past tenses) and a speech act value which includes modal considerations (see discussion in
§2.3.3).","[45, 46]"
"
5 . 1 .2 EXAMPLES OF CONTIGUOUS SVCs
   There are no recorded instances of contiguous SVCs containing more than four verbs.
The majority consist of two verbs. Whether this limitation is due to a grammatical rule or to
pragmatic constraints is not clearly established. Example 5 . 3 has a total of nine clauses,
each represented by a line identified by a letter. Each clause terminates with a medial verb,
except for the terminal one (i), which has a final verb. Five of the clauses (a, b, e, f, g) are
SVCs, each with two verbs that are underlined. The verbs in (a), vose + aira � vosaira ' she
went down' form a compound lexeme.

              the false skin and threw it and it went down into the water and floated and went
              away.'
In almost every SVC in example 5 . 3 the verbs jointly share the same set of subject, object
and oblique referents that are present. The one exception occurs in clause (c) where the
intransitive verb vose-do ' descend', by definition, does not share withfiti 'put down' its
object referent (understood to be kosina voru ' false skin' . The subject NP evetako ai 'that
old woman' is overtly present in (a) only, but its referent persists as subject until the
marked switch in reference at the terminus of (g). The obj ect kosina voru of (g) i s
understood to be the referent of the subject o f both (h) and (i). The NP kosina voru ' false
skin' is the object of both verbs in (g). The locative argument, uvuda ' in the water', is
shared by both verbs in (h).
   In 5 .4 the initial verb mindi ' eat' is transitive with its own obj ect, which the terminal
compound verb ambududuruseri 'they died' does not share. The scope of the inflection
-seri (distant past tense, third person plural subject, assertion speech act marker) marked on
ambududuruseri extends over mindi as well.5.4         ... karaje       mindi ambu+dudur-useri.

   In example 5 . 5 which has three clauses identified by letters and represented by separate
lines, the SVC in line (a) has two intransitive verbs, anumbe 'sit' and iriri ' while she was
remaining' , which share as subject the NP gagara 'girl ' . The four verbs in the SVC in line

he was seeing' . The first three verbs are intransitive, but gosiri is transitive having as its
understood obj ect the girl referenced as subject in line (a).

   Clause c in 5 .6 is a two-verb svc. The scope of the customary tense and the third person
singular subj ect marking extends over both verbs. (It is not obligatory to reference birds
with a plural subject marker.)

   All the verbs in the SVC de Jose jighi borae in 5 .7a share the negative polarity of borae
'not roast (or singe) ' . Example 5 . 7b is ungrammatical, because the negative specifier jo
does not precede the verbs de Jose ' hit and knead' , which are also part of the SVC.

   Any verb position (e.g. V I > V 2 , V 3 ) i n an SVC may b e filled b y a nominal + V unit. Thus
in example 5 .8, the nominal + verbal unit, kaifa + erenere 'care + I am performing at this
very moment', function as the terminal verbal constituent of a contiguous SVC that has bu
'get' as its other constituent. The particle ere ' here and now' can only follow final verbs in
SVcs terminating sentences.

          ' . . . and it is I that have gotten and am guarding the bolt to the door of
          the place of the dead. '
In example 5 .9, the nominal iji ' sun' functions as an adj unct of avi ' dry ' . This nominal +
verb unit expresses a routine activity, ' dry in the sun'. The second verbal unit feghako arira
' it became lightweight' is a nominal qualifier + verb combination that functions here as a
resultative predicate. The bagoya ' mangrove shoot' is the entity referenced as subject for
the combined series of verbal units.

          ' . . . that mangrove shoot . . . dries in the sun and becomes lightweight.'
The nominal qualifier + verb (teria 'large' + e 'do') behave as a verbal unit in example 5 . 1 0

290   Chapter 9include in addition to a generative grammar: ( 1 ) a dictionary of subject matter lexemes,
(2) a system of discourse rules incorporating a body of speech formulas, each with its own
grammar and (3) an ethnography of discourse. This chapter and the next are a preliminary
attempt to apply the subject matter language construct in a limited way to Korafe.
   Subject matter lexemes consist chiefly of names and terms, i.e. ""expressions that native
speakers recognise as conventional and institutionalised and which substitute for part of
speech categories (N , V , etc.)"" (Pawley 1 986: I 03). This would include not only the
morphemes and idioms present in the ' grammarian' s lexicon' , but also the well-formed
complex and compound words that are typically included as dictionary entries in
lexicographer's dictionaries, e.g. brotherliness, forgettable, forgetful, forgetfulness.
   Speech formulas are ""conventional ways of saying things for definable discourse
purposes"" (Pawley 1 994:7). Prototypical speech formulas are ""bundles of at least seven
components: meaning, grammar, lexical form, naturalness (idiomaticity) constraints,
discourse function, discourse context, and prosody or musical conventions. Built into each
formula is a specification of what to say, when to say it, how to say it and why"" (Pawley
1 995 : 7-8). A gestural component is also obligatory for speech formulas used by speech-act
participants face-to-face.
   Pawley ( 1 9 83 :88-95, 1 994 : 1 4- 1 8) distinguishes fixed, semiproductive, and productive
speech formulas. Formulas that are fixed occur with invariant lexical content and word
order. Examples from English include: A rolling stone gathers no moss!, A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush! The formula Good day! is a typical greeting. God bless you! is
often said when someone sneezes.
   Semiproductive formulas occur with severe constraints on the variation. An example is:
What in the name of NP!, used to express extreme annoyance, where there are only a few
acceptable variations of the NP constituent. Two are: What in the name of blue blazes! and
What in the name of heaven!
   Productive formulas are constructions whose lexical content is only partly specified.
Some English formulas are : NPi turned on NP;S heel, The ADJi-er (x) the ADJi/j (Y)! as in The
sooner he leaves town, the better! or The sooner you start, the sooner you 'll be done!, NPi
got NPis nose(s) all out ofjoint, NPi is out to get NP/ Many variables can realise the NPs and
ADJs in exponents of these formulas. Often the tense of the verb can change, as in the
following token of the final formula above: John was out to get Charlie.
   The ethnography of discourse involves ""identifying discourse genres and relating each to
wider systems of knowledge and rules of behaviour, and specifying the discourse structure
rules for each genre"" Pawley ( 1 994:20). Discourse structure rules ""specify an agenda of
things that may be said with an order in which they may be said"" ( 1 994 : 1 8).
   In Korafe, expressions describing most conventional activities consist largely of
sequences of verbs. In order to speak Korafe idiomatically, one must memorise these
standardised verb sequences and master the rules governing their use in discourse. Failure
to do so will hamper not only one ' s fluency in Korafe, but also one ' s ability to apply
syntactic processes like negation correctly to such verb sequences. Without this knowledge,
one is likely to omit verbs that should be included and insert NPs where ellipsis is required.
                                                        Standardised verb sequences and TCCUs   29 1Issues of fluency and thematicity converge with issues of syntactic and semantic well­
formedness in the production of these standardised sequences. Although one might classify
such sequences as idioms, most standardised verb sequences in Korafe are syntactically and
semantically well-formed.
   The focus in this chapter is threefold: ( 1 ) on those verb sequences that rank as subject
matter lexemes, (2) on those clause sequences used as speech formulas and (3) on the
utilisation of subject-matter lexemes, speech formulas, and free expressions in shaping
units, called thematic clause chain units (TCCUS), that package information in a discourse
framework.","[309, 310, 311]"

   The Pacific Linguistics logo was
designed by Ian Scales after one small
panel of a para batuna from Vella
Lavella, held in the Australian
Museum (A8S17). This is an artefact
made from a plaque of fossilised giant
clam shell (Tridacna sp.), carved into
an elaborate fretwork design. These
particular artefacts were made in the
western Solomon Islands, probably
between 100 and 200 years ago.
   The basic cover design is also by
Ian Scales. The motif was drawn by
Malcolm Ross after the stylised

1 54   Chapter 5(3) The temporal relationships (i.e. sequencing and overlap relationships) between the
    verbs are not overtly expressed by their structure, as they are by the medial verbs in
    switch-reference constructions (SRCS).
(4) Only the terminal verb is inflected, but the scope of its inflection (which includes tense,
    aspect, mood, subject marking and speech-act value) extends over all the verbs in the
    series.
(5) All verbal constituents encode events in which at least one of the referents, usually the
    one realised as subj ect, is ' shared' . (The default value for subject referent for the series
    is assumed to be the one marked on the terminal verb.) In addition to its direct coding
    on the verb, the subject NP is sometimes referenced by an overt NP.
(6) Nominal + verb combinations (see §2.6) are regarded as a verbal unit, distributionally
    equivalent to single verb constituents of the SVC.
(7) Verbal constituents cannot be embedded by demonstratives and/or postpositions as a
    complement of another verb in the series.
(8) Modal particles (e.g. are, asi, la, (ano, ai), indicating the speaker' s outlook on an event,
    cannot follow bare verb stems.
(9) SVCs encode events. The term ' event' is used without a modifier to refer to ' conceptual
    event' throughout the rest of this work. According to Pawley ( 1 98 7 : 3 3 5-3 3 6),
    conceptual events are ""the meaning of a clause, containing . . . a kind of action,
    conceptually simple or complex."" ! It has been noted (Lord 1 974: 1 96- 1 97; Bradshaw
    1 982:28; Foley and Olson 1 985 : 1 8-22; Sebba 1 987:2 1 2; Givan 1 990b:23,48; Durie
    1 992:2) that each verb in an SVC can often be considered to express a subpart or aspect
    of a single overall event, which correlates closely with a complex or episodic event, as
    defined by Pawley ?
   Two basic structural types of SVCs can be distinguished in Korafe:3 ( 1 ) contiguous SVcs
and (2) non-contiguous SVcs. Contiguous SVcs minimally consist of an uninterrupted
sequence of two or more verbs. This contiguous set of verbs follows any nominals and       In his taxonomy of conceptual events, Pawley lists: ( I ) simple single actions, (2) episodic ""sequences
       of more or less separate acts"", or (3) complex events, which lie ""between simple and episodic events
       occupying various points on a scale of complexity"". Examples of simple events given by Pawley are:
       Bill released the -rope; John winked; Mary gave me a slap in the lace. The following sentences
       exemplify episodic events: Mary painted a landscape; Bill built his own house. These examples from
       Pawley typify complex events: Bill hit a bal/ through the window; Fido is letching his stick; Mary 's
       words made me angry.
          Pawley also lists generic events and events specified for temporal and spatial settings in his
       taxonomy.
2
       Pawley (personal communication) notes that an event does not necessarily have an objective unity
       outside of the speaker's decision to depict it as such.
3      Foley and Olson ( 1 985:57) and Lane and Pawley ( 1 992:4) have also documented a binary split
       between more closely-knit and more loosely-knit SVcs. Foley and Olson defme ( I ) nuclear and (2)
       core serialisation of predicates in svcs, based on a layered conceptualisation of clause structure.
       Predicates joined at the nuclear layer are juxtaposed. They share all arguments as well as tense,
       polarity, modality, mood, and illocutionary force and must be under one intonational contour.
       Predicates joined at the core level also share all peripheral arguments, tense, polarity, modality, mood,
       and illocutionary force, but they share only one core argument, which may intervene between verbal
       constituents.
          Pawley and Lane differentiate two SVC types for Kalam: simple SVCS and multiscene SVCs.
                                                                                    SVCs    1 55modifiers present in the construction. Non-contiguous SVcs allow nominals and modifiers
to intervene between any two verbs in an SVC.
  The term ' serial verb sequence ' (SVs) is also used to refer to the sequence of verbs,
whether contiguous or not, as opposed to the entire SVC.
   The main questions that attach to the analysis of SVCS in Korafe (and other languages)
are : ( 1 ) are some or all SVCS analysed as a single clause, as a reduced clause sequence, or
something different from the notions, clause or clause sequence? (2) Are SVSs not only
single predicates (if the single clause analysis is chosen), but single lexemes? (3) If entered
in the dictionary, how do we describe the role assignment of SVcs? These questions will be
taken up in detail in a later section.","[173, 174, 175]"

marks in the marking clause and the following reference clause, and the other an overlap
relationship.
   Like the realis paradigms, the irrealis OS medial paradigms distinguish sequencing and
simultaneous temporal relationships. They are additionally differentiated by three sets of
markers that can be labelled: ( 1 ) general irrealis (or future), (2) customary, and (3) negative
hortative.

(third column) and final verb forms in the reference clause (fourth column).

terminates with -0 (rather than -i or -a which would make it a final form) can occur with
final verbs having present, today's past, near past, yesterday's past, distant past, or enduring
past tense forms. Th.e abbreviations used are: OS different subject, T-A-M tense-aspect­
mood, SEQ sequencing, SIM simultaneous/overlapping, OUR durative, NOUR non-durative,
and IPF imperfective.
   The realis medial forms accord with final verbs having tense-oriented TAM suffixes.
Any OS realis medial form (other than near past forms) may occur with any realis final
verb, present or past tenses. The near past medial verb forms occur only in sequences with
fmal verbs marked for present, today ' s past and near past tenses. As for the general irrealis8
       When they are questioned, Korafe speakers declare that customary medial forms should be used with
       the customary final verb and the habitual complex terminating with a final form of ghe 'do again'. In
       practice, however, they use both the irrealis future and customary medial forms in conjunction with
       SRCs that terminate with customary or habitual verb forms.
                                                                                                  SRCs      1 85or future medial forms, they may occur with the entire set of irrealis final verbs. The DS
medial customary paradigm is restricted in its distribution to occurrence with final verbs
marked for customary aspect or verb complexes that indicate habitual aspect. The DS
negative hortative paradigm occurs only with final verbs marked for negative hortative
mood.
    All languages9 in the B inandere family except B aruga have similar tense
correspondences to those listed in Table 6.2 for Korafe. To illustrate the similarity in tense
correspondences that languages in the B inandere family exhibit, Suena tense
correspondences are compared with Korafe sets. Examples illustrating the sequencing of
events having realis status are given in 6.6 (Suena) with 6.7 (Korafe), and examples
illustrating the temporal overlap of events having no realis status in 6.8 (Suena) and 6.9
(Korafe). Irrealis sets are compared in 6.9 (Suena) and 6. 1 0 (Korafe).
   In 6.6 the Suena today' s past tense paradigm is used sentence-medially to encode a
sequencing relationship between the marking clause and the reference clause. The reference
clause is predicated by a final verb in each of the following tenses: present (6.6a), today' s
past tense (6.6b), yesterday's past (6.6c) and past (6.6d).

   A pause-free intonation contour or rhythm group is associated with contiguous SVCs. By
contrast, non-contiguous S V c s that contain conj unctions can occur with pauses, as in
examples 5.22 and 5.23. The Korafe editors of the New Testament thought that a comma
should be placed between vose ' descend' and eva etoda to signal a pause in example 5 .24,
taken from Matthew 1 4 :29.
5.24       Peter ghaka=da ghe               vose,      eva                        eto=da fete

           Jesus=ALOC go.DUR-DP.3S .FN
           ' Peter got down from the boat, stood on top of the sea and went to Jesus.'
The quotation that is itself two sentences long in example 5.25 intervenes between two
verbal constituents sosofe ' lick' and setiri ' she said' of an SVC. Punctuation marks
indicating pauses are positioned after sosofe, the vocative Fono Gimasa, the command gi
' see (about)' , and the statement ravira ' it is burning' and the terminal verb of the SVC,
setiri ' she said and' .

   Pause words enabling the speaker to regroup his or her thoughts, such as avori ' al l
right', also intervene between verbal constituents i n non-contiguous SVcs. In example 5 .26,
the speaker uses avori ' all right' in (b) to signal that he has mentioned all the events
required to precede the final activity 'eating'.

          and Pig Tusk Jewelry', recorded by Sextus Kainafara in December 1 979 in a Village Writers'
          Workshop. When Kingsley Seko edited it in February 1 992, he changed the verb stem ghaghose 'she
          chewed' to the medial form ghaghosedo 'she chewed and'. He dropped the oka gae sosofe ' (she) put
          her limestick into the lime and licked it' . In its place he put a final verb as the quote formula before the
          quote: setira 'she said', removing the quote from being embedded in an Svc.
1 64    Chapter 5          mind-eri.

          ' . . . (a) we collected and put to the side the firewood on top (of the mumu),
          and (b) we collected and put aside the banana leaves, all right, and then
          we ate the food together. '
5 . 3 NEGATIVE DEVERBALS IN SVCs
   Like final verbs, deverbals, both positive and negative, may be the final verb in chaining
structures, as example 5 . 7) above illustrates. (For an explanation of deverbals, refer to §2. 1
and its subsections and §4.6.) In these cases, the negative deverbal l inks the S VC it
terminates to the main clause. In example 5.27, the deverbal joins with the copula rio
5.27    Nunda asug-ari     eveva=go eni jo asuge
        3S .GEN clothe-DVB goOd=CPAR a NEG clothe
        fu-r-ae=ri.
        come.DUR-EPEN-not.do=cOP.AQ
        ' He didn't put on any good clothing and come.'
The whole SVC functions as a very complex nominal expression in combination with iri
' remain' or e ' do', as shown in example 5 .28.
5.28    Nengae        ambo=da jQ       okia=da         bayau iti        mind-ae+areva.
        2S.D.COM back=LOC NEG clay.pot=LOC food                  cook.l eat.I-not.do+do.F .2PL . FN
        , After (this) the two of you will not cook food in a clay pot and eat it. '
   When the negative deverbal precedes the verb stems i n an SVC, i t sometimes functions
as an adverbial form expressing manner. The deverbal forms kotae 'not thinking' , kotae
                                                                   ,
kotae ' haphazardly' and sembae 'mistakenly (lit. not crossing) have lexicalised and
standardly function like adverbs in Korafe. They can occur without the negative specifier jo
clause internally.
5.29    Jumbu!        Kot-ae           fgJj       jumbu!
        pull.UMP think. l-not.do press. r pull.I .lMP
        ' Haul (it in) ! Heedless (of all else), put your weight into it and haul (it in) ! '

'haphazardly (lit. not thinking not thinking)' does not influence it.

   In some cases, the negative deverbal preceding verb stems in an SVC functions similarly
to a participle. In 5.3 1 , the nominal object and the deverbal, bayau itae 'not having cooked
                                                                                                 SVCs     1 65food' , function as an incorporated unit modifying the ellipsed subj ect referenced on the
verb as second person singular.

         ' How come you, not having cooked the food, are lying down and sleeping?'
    Occasionally, however, the negative deverbal, occurring without jo, intervenes in a
string of verb stems. The role played by the deverbal in these cases is unclear. Does it form
a nominal+verb combination with the verb stem e ' do ' , which is not phonologically
distinguishable, and function as a constituent of the svc? If it does not, is it marking the
terminus of an svc that functions as an oblique manner argument of the following verb or
as a participial modifier of the subject? A good example is 5.32, taken from the translation
of Luke 1 3 : 7.
5 .32    Tava+e       g-ae,          bune         jare-do . . .
         look.for+do see.I-not.do not.know.I despair. I-sEQ.SS
         ' We looked for (it), and not seeing it, we were fl ummoxed . . . '
The Korafe men questioned disagreed on how this construction should be viewed, although
all of them insisted that a phonological j uncture (marked by a comma) occurs at the
interface of gae 'not seeing' and bune 'not know'. The two younger men said that gae 'not
seeing' should be written gae e ' do the act of not seeing'. If the younger men's option is
correct, the combination gae+ e 'not seeing+do' should be a constituent of a contiguous
svc. Why, then, do they assert that a comma is necessary, as if it were a non-contiguous
svc?
   The older man adamantly insisted that only gae 'not seeing' should be written. With this
option, it is necessary to posit two svcs, the first one being tava e gae 'having looked for
and not seeing ' . Since it is phonologically distinct from bune jaredo 'not know and give up
hope' , tava e gae 'having looked for and not seeing' cannot be a manner argument of bune
'not know' . However, it can be an svc acting as a participial expression that modifies the
subject. This option provides a more satisfactory explanation of the construction.","[182, 183, 184, 185]"

          Paul stood aside (out of harm' s way). ' (Acts 1 9: 30)
Although both verbs have third person plural subject referents, they are not coreferential.
The subject of oju edo ' (they) feared' is Iesu da dorevare 'Jesus' followers', but the subject
referent of deoro 'they hit and' is the rioting crowd of people at Ephesus. The negative
purpose construction contains three clauses: the sequencing irrealis SS medial form erama
'will do ' , used here to mark the onset of the scope of the negative hortative, the sequencing
negative hortative DS medial form deoro,9 and the negative hortative final form ambeure

16   The '( ' occurs only suffix-initially with e-verbs. Other verbs (u-verbs and i-verbs) occur with -eni, -esi,

17   Both {-a} and {-i} may occur as the fmal speech-act value index on verb forms using the counterfactual

18   The enduring past paradigm is rare and seems to be disappearing. There is a suppletive set of endings
     beginning with -i, e.g. -ia-n-a, -ia-s-a, instead of -ua-n-a, -ua-s-a. Both refuira and refeira 'he was
     coming along' are attested, and there seems no way of ascertaining which is ' right' at this point in time.
19   The { -i} speech-act value that marks predicates in content questions occurs in the current data corpus
     only with first person forms in the hortative mood.

                        CLAUSE CHAIN UNITS (TCCUs)   This chapter examines standardised ways of expressing particular types of events and
situations. It takes up the question: How are things said in Korafe?
     In a much-cited passage, Chomsky ( 1 965 :4) stated that a grammar of a language should
be a systematic description of the linguistic competence of native speakers, competence
being ""the speaker-hearer' s knowledge of the language"". Echoing this view, Radford
( 1 988:3, 27) indicates that ""a model of a native speaker's competence"" is ""a grammar that
tells us what we need to know in order to be fluent in a language"", a grammar being ""a
finite system of rules which generate . . . the infinite set of well-formed sentence-structures in
the language"". In the structuralist grammarian's view, the lexicon is part of the grammar,
lexical items being the form-meaning pairs in a language, morphemes and idioms, that are
unpredictable by the rules of grammar. I
   Pawley ( 1 985 :87-90, 1 994 : 7- 1 8, 27) argues that this ' grammar-lexicon model' presents
                                                              2
an ""impoverished account of linguistic competence"". He argues that a proper speaker
should show nativelike standards in: producing grammatical utterances, pronouncing words
and adhering to conventional intonation, stress and rhythm patterns, being able to decode
fluent speech, knowing the idiomatic way of saying things as opposed to ways that are
merely grammatical, distinguishing between standardi sed expressions and ad hoc
descriptions, and saying the right thing at the right time.
   Drawing on the work of Grace ( 1 987), Pawley proposes an alternative view of languages
as ' subject matter codes (or languages)' . A description of a subject-matter language would
    In recent years, the scope of the lexicon generativists propound has been extended from a minimalist list
    to include: ( I ) more grammatical information about individual lexemes and (2) forms that were initially
    derived by rules of morphonology and syntax, e.g. nominalisations. However, it still differs considerably
    from dictionaries that lexicographers make. Pawley ( 1 986: 1 0 1 ) lists a number of morpheme sequences
    that dictionaries like Webster 's have but grammarians would count as literal expressions, formed by
    productive processes, hence not included in their lexicons.
2
    The term 'grammar-lexicon model' is from Grace ( 1 98 1 ).
        In the 1 960s, Pawley sought to do a grammar and lexicon of Kalam, a Papuan language. Feeling
    dissatisfied both with his grammatical description and early drafts of the lexicon, he ( 1 993 : 1 03) makes
    this comment: ""My thesis . . . failed to record some of the most distinctive and quintessential
    characteristics of the language. The analysis did not give the reader much idea of how the Kalam
    actually say the kinds of things that they say. The most productive patterns for reporting events and
    situations, for instance, were not distinguished from those patterns that were grammatical but
    unidiomatic"" .","[308, 309]"
"9        Some Korafe speakers prefer to use the negative hortative fmal verb forms in all clauses of negative
         purpose constructions, medial and terminal. In this example, deoro would have the form deore 'so that
         they might not hit' .
228        Chapter 77.3 'MISMATCHED' CLAUSES IN THE SRC
   Apparent anomalies in subject referencing occur between marking and reference clauses
that are base constituents of SRCs. In these cases, the initial marking clause indicates that
the following reference clause shares the same subject referent, but the reference clause
does not, in fact, have the same subject referent. The expected and actual patterns are
diagrammed below. For ease of reference, the initial marking clause is labelled S 1 and the
reference clause S2.
       EXPECTED (or CANONICAL):
         S I (SUBJECT=i DS S2 (SUBJECT=j)                        DSWhat actually occurs is the following pattern.
       ACTUAL :
         S I (SUBJECT=i)           SS S 2     (SUBJECT=j)        DSAlthough ellipsis of NP arguments is quite common in SRCs, S2 either has an overt subject
NP or the subject is uniquely recoverable.
   I will refer to such cases as exhibiting 'mismatching' between marking and reference
clauses. Unlike the embedded skipped sentences which do not obligatorily maintain tense
iconicity, these mismatched clauses are either ordered to maintain the temporal iconicity of
the events they reference in the event sequence the SRC represents, or indicate overlap of
one event with two other events that are represented in iconic order. This means that a
mismatched clause cannot be reversed with the clause before or after it.
   Mismatched constructions are associated with three types of clauses in Korafe: ( 1 )
mismatched clauses that encode physiological and psychological responses, (2) mismatched
clauses that provide a temporal, meteorological or circumstantial setting for a subsequent
segment of the SRC, and (3) mismatched clauses that register a temporal overlap between
marking and reference clauses. 1 0

    In §4.4.3 , two distinct options that the Korafe have for encoding emotional responses
were discussed. They are illustrated by examples 4.62 and 4.63, which are repeated here as

18   Unlike innate word stress, a pitch is not necessarily connected with one syllable, but may extend over
     several syllables. However, there are minor pitch fluctuations on every syllable.
19   The fluctuation before fa seems too slight to warrant assigning it its own intonation contour.

    Keghana assigns the greatest posItIve amplitude to the topical component, n i
'you' (which is 3 3 . 1 (-9.6dB) as compared with the amplitude of the focal constituents,
yaresa 'you will go' with ya at 29.4 (- 1 0.6dB) and tela 'no' with te at 27.2 (- 1 1 .3dB)). He
assigns the highest pitch to ya in yaresa (2 1 2.2 Hz as compared with ni which registers
1 7 1 .8 Hz at its highest pitch level). The longest syllable is ya in yaresa at 25 1 milliseconds;
the focal element, ai 'yes', is second longest at 242 milliseconds. Thus, the focal
constituent yaresa is the most accented element in the utterance, ranking first in pitch and
in length and a close second in loudness.
     Seko assigns the highest pitch to the topical component, ni 'you' (2 1 3 .0 Hz as compared
to ya in yaresa 'you will go' which registers 204.6 Hz). The ya in yaresa has the greatest
amplitude in the utterance (32.9 (-9.7dB) as compared to the te in tela ' no' at 24.8
(- 1 2 . 1 dB)). The longest syllable is ai 'yes', at 284 milliseconds, ni is second at 274
milliseconds, and the ya in yaresa is third at 26 1 milliseconds. In the initial auditory
evaluation of this utterance, the focal constituent yaresa appeared to be the most accented
element to all of us listening to the tape. However, the instrument measurements indicate
that yaresa and ni are pretty much on a par. The focal yaresa ranks first in loudness and is
second in pitch and third in length, while the topical ni has the highest pitch and is second
in length and third in loudness.
   Because the focused constituent is the centre of the message the speaker intends to
communicate, it tends to be the most accented element. But, as demonstrated above, the
topic also may be strongly accented. Focal constituents that frequently draw the strongest
accent to them are: ( 1 ) the final lexical verb in a verbal predicate or the stressed word
before the copula in copular predicates, (2) the negative deverbal ae ' not do' in negated
clauses, (3) focus words, such as the focal actor pronouns, the negative specifier ja and the
                                                      Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences    1 43proposition specifier nu, and (4) the interrogative pro-word in content questions. The
Korafe can indicate two significant focal constituents by signalling one with increased
amplitude and the other with higher pitch. In the sample taken, the greatest amplitude is
consistently associated with a syllable of a focal constituent. In over 80% of the cases, the
syllable with the highest pitch also belongs to a focal constituent, but only 1 8.3% of the
examples assign both high pitch and loudness to the same syllable. A syllable belonging to
the topical constituent registers the highest pitch in 25% of the examples and the greatest
length in 50% of the examples.
   The examples illustrating sentence types in the following sections were recorded by
Kingsley Seko (KS: age 65) and Bensted Keghana ( BK: age 5 1 ) in February 1 995 at Baga
village in the Tufi district of the Oro Province. At that point, an auditory analysis using four
relative pitches20 was made both by the men and this writer. Although accent was originally
perceived as high pitch in the auditory analysis, the instrumental analysis by computer
revealed it was only in a little more than half the sentences that high or very high pitch was
the predominant feature associated with syllables perceived to have the greatest accent. For
the others, increased loudness and, occasionally, length played a more significant role. The
computer-produced graphs of amplitude curves and intonation contours convey a more
accurate and complete picture than the 4-pitch auditory analysis, so they are presented with
the examples in the following sections.
    The examples illustrate some trends in the use of intonation contours, loudness, and
length in Korafe sentences. However, the speaker's attitudes at utterance time and motives
in making the utterance also influence the shape of intonation contours, the assignment of
loudness and length, and the positioning of pauses, overlaying and modifying any general
patterns there are. 21 A complete study of the prosodic combinations that are associated with
attitudes such as doubt, relief, joy, grief and anger is beyond the scope of this book.","[161, 162, 163]"
"
4.7. 1 SENTENCE PROSODIES
   Heavy stress or accent marks the thematic, topical and focal constituents in Korafe
utterances. Physiologically, accent is produced by the expulsion of an increased amount of
air from the lungs. In terms of how it is perceived, accent in Korafe coincides with
increases or maj or changes in one or more of three prosodic parameters: duration, intensity
or loudness, and pitch.
   Length in Korafe is associated not only with word stress; increased length is also
associated with accented syllables of utterances (see § 1 .5 and §3 . 1 . 1 ) . Inherently stressed
syllables may be reduced in length when they are not the accented syllables in utterances.
Because of the tendency in Korafe to space stresses uniformly throughout the utterance,
some syllables get reduced to the point of being omitted.
                                                    Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences    141   Loudness i s indicated by amplitude curves in graphs, which were produced for this study
using the CECIL (Computerised Extraction of Components of Intonation in Language)
program: (Hunt 1 990). Amplitude curves display the average heights of the sound wave
from crest to trough correlated with utterances measured over a small fraction of a second.
(The graphs used in this book are calibrated at one tenth of a second.) Two figures are
given for each sound at the measured point in time, the positive number of decibels (dB)
measured from the centre of the frame up and the negative measured from the centre of the
frame down.
   The pattern of pitch changes associated with an utterance or a part of an utterance is
registered by frequency curves (or ' intonation contours'). These contours display the
number of vibrations or hertz (Hz) the sound wave produces in a fraction of a second. Total
intonation contours consist of a precontour and a primary contour that are pronounced
together (Pike 1 945:25-26). The precontour has unstressed syllables, which either rise or
fall in pitch. The primary contour begins with an inherently stressed syllable, termed a
'tonic syllable' by Ladefoged ( 1 975 :99). 1 8 This tonic syllable carries a major pitch change,
either an increase or a decrease in the frequency of the sound wave. A tonic syllable that
occurs with the highest pitch in the intonation contour is called the 'peak ' . Korafe contour
patterns associated with the primary contour, incorporating and continuing the changes that
begin on the tonic syllable, include: falling, falling-slight rise, rising-falling, slight
rise-slight fall-slight rise, and slight fall-slight rise-slight fall. One or more intonation
contours constitute a rhythm unit. A rhythm unit consists of an utterance or part of an
utterance that is bordered by pauses or silence.
   Although the amplitude and frequency curves sometimes vary in harmony with each
other in Korafe, more frequently they fluctuate independently. Thus, the speaker can
indicate thematic, topical and focal constituents with increased length, increased loudness, a
significant fluctuation in pitch or any combination of the three. Prosodic amalgamations
differ in their constituents from utterance to utterance and from speaker to speaker. For
instance, Bensted Keghana ( BK) and Kingsley Seko (KS) assigned distinct frequency curves
(or intonation contours) and amplitude curves to the clause in example 4.98. These are
shown on the following page.
4.98    Ni y-aresa,           ai tefo?
        2S go.DUR-F.2S.FN yes no
        ' Will you go, yes or no?'
   Keghana's utterance is one rhythm group with four intonation contours: ( 1 ) Ni ya re
(2) sa, (3) ai (4) te-fo? 1 9 Seko breaks the rhythm unit constituting his utterance into five
intonation contours: ( 1 ) Ni (2) ya-re (3) sa, (4) ai (5) te-fo?","[160, 161]"

12    According to Longacre (1 972:68-69, 90-9 1), ""natural languages contain in their lexical structure certain
       Expectancy Chains. An Expectancy Chain may involve (i) a succession of actions which customarily
       follow each other in chronological order; (ii) an intent to act plus the action itself; (iii) an obligation to
      act plus the action; or (iv) the ability to act plus the action ... around the world, we find Expectancy
      Chains which involve successive actions such as: 'leave (someplace). .. go. . . arrive '; 'search. . .find';
        'waste away. . . die '; fall down. . . smash. ...
                                                        '
           Expectancy Chains which involve Succession with different actors are such as the following:
        'shoot... die '; 'hit.. . die '; 'call... answer... '; 'give (to someone) ... appreciate '; give (to someone) ... cook (it) '.
       Although most of his examples are paired collocations, Longacre does not clearly differentiate paired
       clause sequences from scripts. (See discussion of scripts in Chapter 1 0.) And two of his multimembered
      expectancy chains definitely correspond more closely to scripts: 'go with hooks... tie hooks. . . catch
      fish. . . bringfish. .. eat ' and 'cook in leaves.. .put into container... bring to the canoe... come down '.
           The standardised clause sequences described in this chapter, for the most part, contain two verbs.
       They are lexically, grammatically, and phonologically constrained. Korafe scripts often involve more
      than two verbs. Although the verbs in Korafe scripts are lexically constrained, the definition of scripts
       does not involve grammatical or phonological constraints.
                                                       Standardised verb sequences and TCCUs   303  In 9. 1 6a a clause sequence encoding continuous aspect, jofughuse iri 'remain
swallowing', is negated as a unit.
9. 1 6a. Nu uvu jo         jofughu-s'+ir-ae=ri.
         3S water NEG swallow.I I-SIM.SS+remain-not.do=COP.AQ
         ' He wasn't continually swallowing water. '
Examples 9. 1 6b and 9. l 6c are ungrammatical because the negative focus marker j 0
intervenes between V I and V2 . It should occur only preceding V I .
9. 1 6b. *Nu uvu jofughu-se           jo  ir-ae=ri.
          3S water swallow. Il-SIM.SS NEG remain-no.do=COP.AQ
9. 1 6c . *Nu uvu jo    jojughu-se         jo  ir-ae=ri.
           3S water NEG swallow. II-SIM.SS NEG remain-no.do=COP.AQ
  Non-standardised sequences of medial verbs do occur with the structures found in 9. l 6b
and 9. 1 6c. (Refer to §6.2 . 3 .) It should be noted that the structure found in 9. 1 6c is
permissible with those standardi sed c lause sequences that are not grammatically
constrained, as 9. 1 7 shows.
9. 1 7   Nu, jQ    namane s-aoro                  jQ      siror-ae =ri.
         3S NEG I PL.EXC say.-SEQ. lR. I PL.DS NEG be.born-not.do=cOP.AQ
         ' Regarding him, it wasn't we that caused him to be born, not at all . '
   When these sequences are negated, a discrepancy between their syntax and semantics
occasionally occurs. Syntactically, the negative focus marker jo must precede V I and V2
must be marked by ae. However, in these cases the semantics of the situation indicate that,
while the event represented by V I did not happen, the event represented by V2 did. In (9. 1 8)
the initial clause contains the negative focus marker and its verb is marked irrealis, and the
second predication has the negative deverbal along with the copula.
9. 1 8   Jo    nune    genembo jigh-ari                  amb-ae=ri.
         NEG 3S.ACT man              hold.l-SEQ.IR.3S.DS die .I-not.do=COP.AQ
         ' It wasn't he that killed the man.'
In reality, the first event is the one that did not happen, but a death actually did occur. The
one accused did not perform the sorcery, but the man did die.
   In standardised clause sequences such as the one in 9. 1 8, the speaker must must make V I
a final verb if he or she wants to negate one verbal constituent without negating the other,
as example 9. 1 9 illustrates.
9. 1 9   Nu genembo kae+jigh-ira,                avata            jQ      amb-ae=ri.
         3S man        poison+hold. I-TP.3S.FN that.CT. FRUS NEG die.I-not.do=COP.AQ
         ' He performed sorcery on the man, but (the man) didn't die.'","[322, 323]"

7.2.2. 1 PURPOSE CONSTRUCTIONS WITH POSITIVE POLARITY
   Purpose constructions with positive polarity are grounded temporally and referentially in
the matrix clause.
   When the subj ect of the terminal clause is coreferential with the subj ect of the matrix
clause, purpose clauses terminate with a positive deverbal (ari form) as in example 7.9,
where the purpose construction terminates with ningari 'hear'.
   When the subjects are not coreferential, a D S irrealis medial verb (or a final verb in the
hortative mood) 8 is the terminal verb in the embedded chain. In example 7. 1 0, the verb
predicating the purpose clause has a sequencing irrealis D S medial form, but the SRC
terminates with a fmal verb having today' s past tense and realis status.",[245]
"In example 2.79, the sequencing realis past SS medial form s /ena 'I came and' and ena ' I
went and ' occur i n an SRC that terminates with a final verb i n the distant past tense: sisira
'he said' .
2.79   . . . na   jovereghe                                                   nati=da       oto

       ' . . . 1 turned around and came (back) to the village, got the axe, went and gave
       it to father, and father said . . .   '
A copula or final verb in any tense can terminate sentences with dependent final verbs
predicating dependent bases. In the topic-comment in example 2 . 80, a distant past
dependent final verb form fusena ' I came' terminates an SRC, which functions as an
internally headed relative construction. This construction relativised by avo 'that one'
forms the comment which terminates with the copula rio

56      Chapter 2In example 2 . 8 1 , a distant past dependent final form of the verb i ' go ' occurs in the

2 . 5 .2 DIFFERENT SUBJECT (DS) MEDIAL VERB PARADIGMS
    Korafe has four realis and six irrealis DS medial verb paradigms. Each of the paradigms
is comprised of a stem and a suffix set. When the imperfective morpheme occurs, the stem
II form of the verb must occur. The general structure of DS medial verbs is:
        verb stem IIII (lPF) + suffix set.
     The suffix sets have the following constituents:
        Relative timing/STATUS + SUBJECT:PERSONINUMBER + { -o } .
The initial partial by itself o r i n combination with an imperfective marker indicates the
relative timing of the verb it marks (prior to [SEQ] or overlapping [SIM]) with the verb
predicating the reference clause and the status (realis or irrealis) of the marked medial verb.
The second partial marks the person and number of the subj ect referent in the marking
clause. The final {-o} expresses the outward focus, indicating that it has a relationship with
the subsequent reference clause, and more specifically indicating that the reference clause
has a different subject than the marking clause.
     The suffix sets for DS medial verb forms are shown in Table 2.6. Both the imperfective
{-uru } and the suffix sets are given for the simultaneous irrealis paradigms. But only the
suffix sets are shown for the DS near past and DS enduring past medial paradigms, because
placement of { ere- } depends on the stem configuration, as given in the ere placement rule
in §(7) at the beginning of this chapter.

2.5.2. 1 OS REALlS SEQUENCING PARADIGM : STEM 1 + {- ENO }
   The sequencing realis medial verb paradigm is the most frequently used DS medial verb
set. Examples of the paradigm are:
       Person           ' say'                'enter'            ' see'           ' write'
       IS               se-teno               tere-teno          g-eno            gemb-eno
       2S               se-teso               tere-teso          g-eso            gemb-eso
       3S               se-tiri               tere-tiri          g-iri            gemb-iri

       2PL              se-tevo               tere-tevo          g-evo            gemb-evo
Thi s paradigm resembles the today ' s past tense final forms, and exhibits the same
fluctuation between e-verbs using the -�eno suffix set and i-verbs and u-verbs with the -eno
suffix set. The underlined medial verb gembero 'we have written' in example 2.82 refers to
an event with realis status that occurred prior to the event marked by the present tense form
of the verb, tetererira ' it is entering' , which terminates the SRC.

2.5.2.2 O S REALlS SEQUENCING OURATIVE PARADIGMS :
             NEAR PAST: {ERE-} + STEM II + { -ANO}
             ENDURING PAST: { ERE-} + STEM 1I + {-UANO}
   Korafe has two OS sequencing durative paradigms that are very occasionally used: the
near past and the enduring past paradigms. Both obligatorily occur with the imperfective
marker { ere-} . The OS sequencing near past medial paradigm resembles the near past final
paradigm, except for the final { -o } . It encodes iterated events or processes that began
yesterday or today and terminated before or right at the commencement of the event
encoded by the reference clause.
58       Chapter 2         Person      ' say'          'enter'               'see'               'write'

The OS sequencing enduring past medial paradigm resembles the enduring past final
paradigm, except for the final { -o} . It indicates a process or iterated activity that began at
least three days ago but may have begun long before in the enduring past. The available
examples all encode activities that terminate at the point the event encoded in the reference
clause commences.
         Person      'say '          'enter'               'see'               'write'

     In example 2.83, the activity encoded by the DS sequencing enduring past medial verb
eregefuano ' I was weaving' terminates at the point the speaker ran out of the string
encoded by the reference clause, asi dadabetira, which has as its predicate a final verb in
the today' s past tense.

          'I was weaving a stringbag until I ran out of string. '
2 . 5.2.3 OS REALIS SIMULTANEOUS PARADIGM: STEM [ ] + {-END}
   The simultaneous realis different subject medial paradigm resembles the present tense
verb forms without { e re- } , but with final {- o} instead of { -a} . These forms indicate
temporal overlap between the predicate of the marking clause and the predicate of the
reference clause. The following examples illustrate the paradigm:
         Person         'say'           'enter'            'see'              'write'
         IS             s-eno           teter-eno          gos-eno            gef-eno
         2S             s-eso           teter-eso          gos-eso            gef-eso
         3S             s-iri           teter-iri          gos-iri            gef-iri

In example 2.84, the verbs irero 'while they were living' and darigero 'while they were
clearing out' have simultaneous realis medial forms.
2.84       . . . kora                a=in=da       totofo Evaraga+Oyani a=i

        living (there), the Korafe arrived. They arrived, attacked them, and while
        they (Evaraga and Oyani) were clearing out, the Korafe settled (there). '
These two verbs encode events that overlap with the events signalled b y the final verbs in
each of the sentences.
2.5.2.4 os IRREALlS (FUTURE) PARADIGMS:
              Sequencing paradigm:              stem I + {-ono }
              Simultaneous paradigm:            stem II + { -uru} + { -ono}
   The os irrealis (future) medial set is more frequently used than the other irrealis medial
sets, the customary and negative hortative. Both sequencing and simultaneous paradigms of
each of these sets occur with the same suffix sets. But the sequencing paradigm manifests
stem I forms, and the simultaneous paradigm occurs with stem I I forms and the
imperfective marker { - uru } . The sequencing paradigm resembles the hortative mood
paradigm, even exhibiting the fluctuation between {-one } and { -aone} , but occurring with
final {-o} rather than -e. Paradigm examples are:

This paradigm occurs in SRCs that terminate with any irrealis form: future tense, customary
aspect, counterfactual mood and positive hortative mood paradigms, positive and negative
deverbals and forms in the imperative mood. The underlined verbs are marked as os
sequencing irrealis medial forms in the following examples which terminate with a final
hortative form (2.85), a counterfactual form (2. 86), a customary form (2.87) and a negative
deverbal construction (2.88).

Examples of the DS simultaneous irrealis medial paradigm are :

   The surface structure forms illustrated by the above paradigm examples result from
applying the r-insertion and regressive vowel gobbling phonological rules. The
simultaneous irrealis medial verb ururoro 'while they will be endeavoring' indicate that its
action overlaps with the actions of the verbs that follow it in example 2.89.

2.5.2.5 DS CUSTOMARY PARADIGMS:
                 Sequencing paradigm:            stem I + { -eono}
                 Simultaneous paradigm:          stem II + { -uru} + {-eono}
   The DS customary medial paradigms occur only in SRCs that obligatorily terminate with
a customary aspect final verb form or an habitual clause complex. Paradigm examples are :
        Person         ' say'              'enter'               'see'                  ' write'
        IS             s-eono             ter-eono              g-eono                  gemb-eono
        2S             s-easo             ter-easo              g-easo                  gemb-easo

       For the rest of the interlinear examples, the morpheme-by-morpheme translation for medial verbs with
       {-uru} will not include the marking imperfective. The marking SIM with irrealis (IR), customary (CUST)
       and negative hortative (NEG.H) will signal the presence of the imperfective marker, as in:
          lI-r-uroro                   or gef-uroro               or gef-ureoro

One only rarely fmds the simultaneous customary medial verb forms in texts, because the
os simultaneous irrealis (future) forms are used instead. When employed, the simultaneous
customary medials encode events that overlap with other events on a customary or habitual
basis, like the mosquito's advent while people are sleeping (avirureoro) in example 2.9 1 .

           buzzes in the person's ear. Then it bites hislher body.)'
2.5.2.6 OS NEGATIVE HORTATIVE PARADIGMS:
                 Sequencing paradigm :               stem I + { -eono}
                 Simultaneous paradigm:              stem [[ + { -uru } + {-eono}
   The OS negative hortative medial forms occur only in SRCs where the final reference
clause has as its predicate a negative hortative final verb form. Like the negative hortative
29      Some older speakers utilise this paradigm: -eaono, -easo, -eari, -eaoro, -eaovo. Because of the current
        trend to allow only two unique vowels in a sequence, most speakers use the {-eono} set, but Elijah
        Simati modified the sequence to 'ea ' rather than 'eo ' in this example: borearo and ambearo.
62      Chapter 2final verb forms, these forms occur with stress on the second vowel in the suffix. Examples
of the sequencing negative hortative medial paradigm are:
        Person          'say'             'enter'              'see'                  'write'

The negative hortative medial form refers strictly to hypothetical events that the speaker
hopes will never eventuate in the real world. The negative hortative focus marker { era}
usually precedes the initial constituent in multiclausal negative hortative SRCs.
2.92      Era                        eovo,                       dara      re-f-ua

2 . 6 NOMINAL + VERB COMBINATIONS I N KORAFE
  Like other Papuan languages, Korafe has complex expressions formed by nominals or
nominal compounds with verbs.The nominals may relate to accompanying verbs as either
complements or adjuncts.3D The term 'complement' is used here to refer to obligatory
nominal constituents which are objects of accompanying verbs or predicate complements.
The term ' adjunct' is used for nominal constituents which modify accompanying verbs.","[75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]"
"
5 . 1 . 1 PROPERTIES OF CONTIGUOUS SVCs
   In addition to the properties of SVCS listed above, contiguous SVCs have the following
properties:
( 1 ) They consist minimally of a series of two verbs, but may contain up to four verbs.
(2) It is common for the transitive verbs in contiguous S VC s to share the same obj ect
    referent. The referent of oblique arguments may also be shared.
(3) NPs and modifiers obligatorily precede the series of verbs.
(4) The scope of negation obligatorily extends over all verbs in the sequence. The onset of
    negation is obligatorily marked by jo 'not' and the terminus by a negated verb form
    (negative deverbal marked by ae).
(5) Verbal constituents cannot be linked by conjunctions. (The list of conjunctions can be
    found in Table 8. 1 .)
(6) The entire construction is uttered without any perceptible pauses (0. 1 second or longer)
    under a single intonational contour.",[175]
"(2) Non-finite verb forms
   Non-finite verb forms are inflected verbs that are not marked for person. Deverbal forms
and SS medial verb forms are non-finite forms, composed of a verb stem and an invariable
suffix.
   Both positive and negative deverbal forms occur with stem I. Positive deverbals take the
suffix -ari: x{stem}-ari 'to x, x-ing'.
2.7   a.   s-ari                     b.     it-ari                       c.   gemb-ari

           'to speak/speaking'              'to cook/cooking'                 'to write/writing'
   Negative deverbals host the suffix -ae : X{stem}-ae 'not x-ing ' . Their structure and
functions are the focus of §2. 1 .
2.8   a.   s-ae                      b.     it-ae                        c.   gemb-ae
           say.l-not.do                     cook.l-not.do                     write.l-not.do
           'not saying'                     'not cooking'                     'not writing'
   Non-finite SS medial verb forms utilise three invariable suffixes, -do, - a, and -se, to
signal temporal relationships between marking and referencing clauses. Stem I verb forms
occur only with -do. They indicate non-durative events that are completed before the
reference clause event starts. Stem II forms signal durative events that express rhythmic
iteration (with -do and a form ofJu 'come' or i 'go'), sequencing durative irrealis events
and states (with -a), and overlapping events or states (with -se).
2.9   a.   gembu-do                            b.        gefu-do

"24
     Pawley suggests that pauses under 0.2 second should not be considered as markers of TCCU boundaries.
25
     Multiclausal sequences that encode iteration at irregular intervals are an exception to this rule. They may
     form several TCCUs.
330     Chapter 9
(4) Even though TCCUs in SRCs are multiclausal, like clauses, they are restricted to having
three unmarked or core arguments. Clauses typically have one to three arguments that are
not obligatorily marked. These are the syntactic core arguments, subject and obj ect, and the
pragmatic topic (P I ) argument. These arguments are realised as overt NPs and/or by the
subject marker on verbs within the chain. TCCUs are also limited to three core arguments
that are not obligatorily marked.
   However, TCCUs contrast with clauses in their assignment of arguments. In any given
clause, each core argument may be assigned only one syntactic role. In T C C Us, core
arguments may have object role in one clause and subj ect role in a subsequent clause. For
instance ghaito in unit 3 of 9.72 is an overt NP object of the first clause ghaito ruvedo 'they
coil up the pandanus' , the referent of the ellipsed object of fitoro 'they put (it) ' , and the
referent of the ellipsed subject of irari ' it remains' . Peripheral arguments, such as ijida 'in
the sun' in unit 2 of 9.72, are realised as overt PPs wherever they are needed within the unit.
(5) When the scope of negation extends over more than one TCCU, the negative focus
marker jo 'not' must be repeated. In 9.74 thejo appears in the second unit before nunda
dombuda 'before him' and is repeated in the third unit before the negative deverbal form
sae 'not saying' .

(6) Discontinuity-signalling devices define initial and terminal boundaries of TCCUS. z6 The
linguistic evidence at TCCU boundaries suggests that focused or activated concepts in the
speaker' s short-term memory shift slightly. This cognitive shift appears to be registered by
a shift to a less continuous referential coding device on the topic continuity continuum, e.g.
a shift from using verb agreement markers alone to using N Ps. In fact, the primary

      Longacre ( 1 972:26-50) in conjunction with several others, notes the existence of ""devices which break
      up chains into subchains"" in many of the chaining languages in Papua New Guinea. He uses Scott's
      material on Fore as an example (pages 27-29). Suffixes which mark verbs that define significant
      multiclause sub-chains in Fore SRCs include: ( I ) three morphemes which indicate that the verbs in the
      chain in which they occur have the same set of participants, (2) the <-aga> set marking DS verbs, (3) the
      suffix -nta, which splits up a chain of ss medial verbs, and (4) two other ' focal' suffixes that embed a
      string which has a different subject.
                                                              Standardised verb sequences and TCCUs         33 1signalling device at TCCU onsets is the occurrence of one to three overt N Ps or PPs. Not
every TCCU must begin with an NP, but there appears to be a strong preference for having
an N P at the beginning of the first TC C U in a sentence after the recapitulating TCCU.
Sometimes, NPs are placed in their own rhythm group (TCCU), preceding the TCCU that
details the interaction of their referents. When this happens, NPs may be copied by a
pronoun within the following TCCU. Pronouns may occur as an initial NP, even when they
are not copying an NP in the previous TCCU.
     Discontinuity at the terminal border of TCCUs may be signalled by any of the following:
( 1 ) the pause indicator avo/avori 'all right';
(2) a terminal clause encoding a temporal notion or followed by a temporal conjunction,
    such as ainda amboda 'after that', ainda gitida ' before that', ainda jokada 'within that
    span', and ainghae dabade 'at the same time';
(3) a determiner (e.g. amo 'thatTlF', ava 'that.CT') or a conj unction (e.g. aindae (sedo) 'on
    account of that' and gido 'so/seeing') following the terminal clause;
(4) a final verb;
(5) a 0 S sequencing medial verb predicating an intransitive clause and expressing a
    resulting effect; or
(6) a o s simultaneous medial verb, except when followed by a perception verb (e.g. gido
    ' seeing' , ningido ' hearing' , bune jaredo 'not knowing and despairing' , itatamedo
    'feeling', bune jaredo 'not knowing and despairing' or tambudo ' finding').
More than one discontinuity signalling device may occur at the terminal boundary of a
TCCU. In one oral text, the following combination terminates a thematic clause chain unit:
dadabetiri ainda amboda, avo . . . ' it finished and after that, all right . . . '
   The following examples illustrate the use of some of the TCCU indicators listed above.
Example 9.75 was segmented into TCCUs by three men, who broke the sentence up at my
request. I expected that they would give me clauses, but they gave me a segmentation by
TCCUs. Although they did break it down into clauses after some discussion, it seems that
the TCCU segmentation was the natural one for them.

      In the process of segmenting this sentence, the men regularised the os irrealis form irurari 'while it will
      be going' in the original sentence to the os customary form irureari 'while it goes' to operate in concord
      with the customary form of the sentence final verb, mindiraera 'we eat'.

In example 9.75, the first 3 units commence with an overt N P. The perception verb gido
' seeing' terminates unit 1 . Units 2 and 3 terminate with an intransitive different subj ect
medial verb. Each unit also has its own theme. In unit 1 the kunai grass is burned. The
movement of the wallabies in response to the fire dominates unit 2. In unit 3, a man kills a
wallaby. The coordinated structure gorobai afe gaedo {j ghamanai je basedo 'throw a spear
and pierce and bludgeon with a stone' encodes two methods used in accomplishing the kill.
Unit 4 encodes a movement sequence, expressed by the verbs budo-yama-buvudo ' get-go­
arrive' . In unit 5, the wallaby is roasted, cut and eaten.
   Example 9.76 is from the legend Jaruga Roro.

          she was repeatedly sawing through. '
Each one of the units in this example commences with an overt NP. In fact, the first unit
contains two internal NPs initially: evetu genembo isambu 'all the people' with subject
function and oju bekd ava 'very great fear' with object function. An NP with object function
beka baka 'chatter' is the initial component in unit 2. In unit 3, the initial core NP in a TCCU
is realised by just a pronoun, nu 'she' . The NP in unit 4 has an embedded clause nunda ruka
dighera 'her brother that they had tied' within it. The embedded clause is in a possessive
relationship (indicated by da 'of) with the head noun asi ' vine rope' . There is a slight
pause between this NP and the rest of TCCU.
   In 9.76 unit 1 has just one clause. Unit 2 terminates with an intransitive DS verb form.
Unit 3 is an aspectual clause sequence conveying sporadic iteration of the entire series,
marked by ghuse 'while doing again' . It includes two standardised SVSs direction + motion
verb combinations savi+ya ' go in' and buvu+foa 'come back out' within it.
   Thematically, unit one in 9.76 encodes an emotion, not an action. The state of the
participants involved is the primary semantic focus of unit 2. Unit 3 details the movements
of Jaruga Roro's sister, and unit 4 details the rescue operation she mounts for her brother.
    The previous examples have been SRCs. Example 9.77. which is from a sermon given by
an Anglican evangelist, Oscar Done, exemplifies TCCUs that operate over non-chaining
structures. It contains simple sentences (e.g. units 1 0 and 1 4), chaining sentences (e.g. units
4-8 and unit 9) and co-ranking sentences (e.g. units 1 -3 and 1 1- 1 3). None of the sentences
is conjoined by tail-head linkage. The length in seconds of each TCCU and pause is given in
the parentheses.

In contrast with example 9.73 exemplifying an SRC, in which TCCUs average 2.32 seconds
in length and five words per unit, the TCCUs in example 9.77 average 1 . 1 7 seconds and
three words per unit. The longest unit (unit 1 3 ) is two seconds and contains five words
comprising two clauses, j uxtaposed with each other and predicated by final verbs. No unit
contains more than two clauses, and some contain only NPs or PPs (units 4, 6, 7, 1 1 and 1 2).
Other than the SRC in unit 8 and the CRS in unit 1 3 , all the units are clauses or fragments of
clauses. This is typical of simple sentences and CRSs which tend to obey the general ' one
clause at a time constraint' operative in the delivery of spontaneous connected discourse in
English (Pawley and Syder 1 983 :202).
   TCCUs provide thematic packaging for and thematic continuity in discourses.
                                        CHAPTER 1 0
                      INTRODUCTION TO KORAFE DISCOURSE   Pike ( 1 954:33, 57) defined a 'discourse' as a ""behavioreme"", a chunk of human
behaviour that has internal structure and a definite beginning and end, recognised by the
cultural community using it. Crystal ( 1 985 :96) gives several definitions of ' discourse'
ranging from ""a behavioural unit which has a pre-theoretical status in linguistics"", to ""a set
of utterances which constitute any recognisable speech event"".
   The discussion of Korafe discourses in the next two chapters is restricted to internally
connected and bounded multi sentence utterances and written texts and their features.
Although the features to be described can also be observed in conversations involving
several Korafe participants, I will concentrate on monologues and written texts, from here
on termed 'texts'. To treat conversations would take us well beyond the limits imposed on
this study.
   A text may be a story that involves participants interacting with each other in events that
build up to a crisis and then are resolved. Or it may expound a theme giving supporting
arguments. It may be a sermon, a letter or an encyclopedic description. Other possibilities
for it exist as well.
    The Korafe employ two basic strategies in their organisation of discourses: ( 1 ) tense­
iconic ordering and (2) thematic organisation. Discourses that have narration of events or
listing of procedures as their basic communicative goal are primarily ordered tense­
iconically. Discourse segments that are tense-iconic have chaining structures as their
primary components. At sentence junctures, they commonly manifest tail-head linkage.
Discourses that illustrate or support themes and topics manifest thematic organisation.
Thematically oriented discourse segments make use of all sentence structures, but are
characterised by frequent use of co-ranking structures, which are linked by juxtaposition or
conjunction.
   These two organisational strategies are useful in differentiating two types of paragraphs
and types of discourses. Section 1 0. 1 describes a prototypical chaining paragraph,
distinguishing it from a thematic one. Section 1 0.2 treats discourse structure rules that
operate across all discourse genres. Discourse structure rules that apply more specifically to
discourses with tense-iconic ordering or thematic organisation are presented in § 1 0.3.
Included in the discussion are speech formulas that signal specific discourse genres.
   The conventional knowledge a speech community shares about the routine activities its
members engage in is often encoded in discourse by structures which represent appropriate
sequences of events in given contexts. These structures are termed scripts. Section 1 0.4                                                336
                                                                      Introduction to Korale discourse     337introduces the notion of scripts, outlining the types of scripts and their standard components
and how they are invoked. Several Korafe scripts with their component parts are then
delineated.","[349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357]"

                                                                                                          INTRODUCTION ( TUTURO)              1.1 AIM, SCOPE AND THEORETICAL ORIENTATION
                This book compares and contrasts the structure and functions of three types of complex
             constructions in Korafe, a language spoken in the Oro Province of Papua New Guinea.
             These three constructions are: (1) serial verb constructions (svcs), (2) switch-reference
             constructions (SRCS), and (3) co-ranking constructions (CRCs). SVCs and SRCS contrast with
             co-ranking constructions in the types of information they present and in the communicative
             goals they are designed to accomplish. These constructions are central to the organisation
             of Korafe discourse.
                To facilitate an understanding of the structure of the complex constructions, a brief
             overview of morphological and syntactic structures is provided. Verbs and their
             morphology are outlined in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 summarises the structure and functions of
             noun phrases and the related postpositional phrases, and Chapter 4 presents predications,
             polarity and basic sentences/sentential modes.
                Chapters 5, 6, and 7 detail the features of the two 'chaining' structures, SVCs and SRCS.
             Chaining structures terminate with a verb of fuller structure than the preceding verbal
             constituents, which are verb stems in SVCs and medial verb forms in SRCs. These verbal
             predicates are normally linked by juxtaposition and may occur with arguments. However,
             syntactic constraints marked on or implicit in chaining structures enable the speaker to
             monitor subject reference from verb to verb without using very many overt noun phrases.
             SVCs are the focus of Chapter 5. The rules governing the structure and argument-tracking
             system of SRCs are given in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 examines some discrepancies in linear
             argument tracking in Korafe SRCs.
                Co-ranking constructions are the focus of Chapter 8. In co-ranking constructions, all the
             constituents terminate with verbs of the same rank, namely final verbs, or in topic-comment
             constructions, predicate complements. Co-ranking constructions combine clauses, SRCS,
             and/or other co-ranking sentences by juxtaposing or conjoining them. Bases are syntactically
             related to each other by parataxis or hypotaxis. A common pragmatic relationship
             expressed by bases in co-ranking constructions is the theme-rheme relationship. Sentence

2    Chapter 1verbs (including medial verbs that are the predicates of distinct clauses) are found in
Korafe. These units convey semantic notions such as direction+motion, posture+state,
cause+effect, manner+action, iteration at uneven intervals and rhythmic iteration. These
predictable verb sequences are integrated into the structure of a unit, here termed the
thematic clause chain unit (TCCU). TCCUs represent the speaker' s chunking of information
into intonational pause-free units.
   Chapter 1 0 compares the use of chaining and co-ranking constructions in discourse. A
prototypical chaining paragraph is contrasted with a prototypical thematic paragraph. It
outlines the discourse structure rules that characterise discourses in general and
differentiate discourse genres, making use of tense-iconic chaining structures and logically
ordered 'thematic' structures as well as speech formulas. It concludes with a delineation of
some common scripts that are threaded into the warp and woof of Korafe discourses.
   Devices encoding cohesion and prominence in Korafe discourse are the focus of Chapter
11.
   This study is designed to enrich the growing corpus of data on Papuan languages, which
are still under-represented in typological and theoretical accounts of the languages in the
world. It builds on the research of many of my colleagues in the Summer Institute of
Linguistics' as well as that of others analysing Papuan languages ? It expands on those
frontiers in the following ways:
1.   It identifies a Korafe unit between clause and sentence which plays an important role in
     structuring the flow of information in Korafe discourse. This unit is the thematic clause
     chain unit (TCCU) and corresponds to Pawley and Syder' s ( 1 983 :202) ""fluent unit"" and
     Chafe ' s ( 1 987:22) ""intonation unit"". It is defined by phonological, grammatical and
     semantic criteria.
2.   It shows how the Korafe use personal pronouns as a contrastive focus device and as
     markers of TCCU onsets.
3.   It details the features of chaining and co-ranking structures and shows how they
     contrast in their discourse functions.
4.   It argues that canonical SRCs convey foregrounded events in tense-iconic discourses.
     There are two special cases that are accounted for in this description: ( 1 ) discrepancies
     in the switch-reference anticipatory coding system and (2) simultaneous and sequencing
     durative medial verb forms that appear to realise clauses in tense-iconic SRC sequences.
5.   It shows how discourses in Korafe cohere. It describes that cohesion in terms of
     Givan's ( 1 987: 1 79, 1 990a:827 and Givan, ed. 1 983) suggested parameters of discourse
     continuity: ( 1 ) temporal, locational, participant and action continuity in tense-iconic
     discourses, and (2) thematic continuity in thematically-oriented discourses.","[20, 21, 22]"
"   Twenty-four years ago when my husband, our son Jamie and I went to Tufi, we did not
realise how deep our relationships with the Korafe people would go. They not only allowed
us to study their language; they welcomed us into their family! We appreciate the help and
generosity of all the Korafe and Mokorua people in the Tufi area, particularly the people of
Baga Village where we settled. We are deeply indebted to Justus and Rhoda and Brigitte
Seko, Kingsley and Barbara Seko, Dunstan and Zelma Seko, Michael and Magdalene Mota,

2.4. 1 1 NEGATIVE HORTATIVE MOOD: STEM I + {-EONE}
   Examples of the negative hortative paradigm are:
       Person       ' say'         'enter'         ' see'         'write'
       IS           s-eone        ter-eone         g-eone         gemb-eone
       2S           s-eose        ter-eose         g-eose         gemb-eose
       3S           s-eure        ter-eure         g-eure         gemb-eure
       1 /3PL       s-eore        ter-eore         g-eore         gemb-eore
       2PL          s-eove        ter-eove         g-eove         gemb-eove
  The negative hortative paradigm is the negative counterpart to the imperative forms,
expressing prohibitions. Negative hortative forms optionally occur with the negative focus
marker { era} 'don't' which has the variants: era, erua, erama and eruama.
2.73    Sarara era     eave!
        crying NEG do.NEG.H.3 PL.CR
        ' Don't cry ! '
It also occurs i n negative purpose constructions (detailed i n §7.2.2.2), expressing negative
purpose, apprehensions and precautions.
52     Chapter 22.4. 1 2 IMPERATIVE MOOD:
        Simple form:       stem I (+-vu)
        Durative form:     { ere-} + stem II + (-vu)
        Simultaneous form: stem II +-uru + (-vu)
   Korafe has three imperative sets: ( 1 ) the simple imperative, (2) the durative imperative
with { ere- } and (3) the simultaneous imperative with {-uru} . Although imperative forms
are final independent verbs, their paradigm is deficient, containing only second person
forms. The singUlar and plural forms of the simple imperative set and the singular form of
the other two sets are shown below:
                           'do'         ' speak'     'enter'      'see'          ' write'
       Simple (s):         e           se            tere         gi         gembu
       Simple (PL) :       e-vu        se-vu         tere-vu      gz-vu      gembu-vu
       Durative:           er-u        re-sz         teter-er-u   ere-gosu   ere-gefu
       Simultaneous:       u-r-uru     si-r-uru      teter-uru    gos-uru    gefuru
   The simple imperative indicates a command to perform the action or state encoded by
the verb one time. Its singular form is identical with the stem I citation form; stress occurs
with the initial syllable in non-complex verbs with three syllables or less. For plural forms,
the stem I form occurs with the second person plural marker -v and the speech-act value
marker {-i}, which is realised as -u. Stress falls on the [mal vowel (class or characteristic
value) of the stem as example 2.74 shows with the plural command, bUvu 'take (PL)'.
2.74    Nimamo Sextus=da           ghaka    bU-vu!
         2S . father Sextus=GEN canoe take. I-2PL.lMP
         'Take your classificatory father Sextus' canoe ! '
    The durative imperative with the imperfective marker { ere- } occurs very rarely. It
encodes the idea: 'do x for a while' , as eregefu 'write for a while' in example 2.75
illustrates.
2.75     Ere-geru,         e-do          fu-r-ase!
         IPF-write.II.IMP dO.l-SEQ.SS come.DUR-EPEN-H.2S.CR
         ' Write for a while and then come ! '
   The simultaneous imperative, formed with the exocentric imperfective marker -uru,
implies that another action will overlap with the action encoded in the command. In
example 2.76, the speaker promises to come while the addressee is stil l doing his
assignment.
2.76    Na saramana mut-ena                a=va      ururu,       na fo-r-one!
         I S work         give.I-TP. I S.FN that=CT dO. lI.IPF.IMP I S come.DUR-EPEN-H. I S.CR
         ' Get doing the work that I gave you today, and while you're still working, I will
         come (back).'
   When the addressee is at a distance o r when the interlocutors are farewelling each other,
the stentorian or declamatory -0 terminates the imperative forms. The y-insertion rule
applies in the formation of the singular stentorian imperatives (e.g. e -7 e- 0-7 e-yo). The
                                                                                        Karafe verbs   53vowel-gobbling rule applies in the formation of the plural stentorian forms (e.g. e-vu --7
e-vu-o --7 e-vo).
      Stentorian     ' Do ! '   ' Speak! ' ' Enter ! '   ' See ! '   ' Write ! '
      Singular:      eyo        seyo        tereyo       giyo        gembUyo
      Plural:        evo        sevo        terevo       givo        gembUvo
2.5 FINITE VERB FORMS - MEDIAL VERB PARADIGMS
    Like final verbs, finite same-subject and different-subject medial verb forms host a
tripartite suffix set. As their name suggests, medial verbs occur sentence-medially. They
must agree in status (realis or irrealis) with a subsequent final verb.
   Unlike independent final verbs, medial verbs do not occur with the epistemic clitics: asi
'saying that', tano ' probably ' or tanojo ' perhaps ' . The frustrative ta ' contrary to your
expectation' occurs occasionally with os medial verb forms.
   Unlike dependent final verbs, medial verbs cannot precede demonstrative topicalisers
                                                                             ,
(e.g. amo ' given that, aimi 'by means of that', ava 'that (contrastive) ). Nor can they
precede conj unctions which utilise these topicalisers or do not maintain iconic ordering of
the events they link (e. g. amo 'if, when', avata 'but, although', ava sedo 'therefore' , ainda
susu mo 'the source of that').
   The SS sequencing realis medial sets are described in § 2 . 5 . 1 . The os medial verb
paradigms are the focus of §2.5.2.","[71, 72, 73]"
"
17   The term 'sentence' is not easily defined. Three types differentiated by Lyons ( 1 977:622-635) are:
     system-sentences, text-sentences, and utterance-units. System-sentences can be generated from the
     formal grammatical rules without reference to any deictic or endophoric context. Text-sentences are
     ""context-dependent utterance-signals (or parts of utterance-signals)"" (Lyons 1 977:622). Utterance-units
     are a subset of utterances which Harris ( 1 95 1 : 1 4) defines as ""any stretch of talk by one person, before
     and after which there is silence on the part of that person"". Simple utterance units ""contain one and only
     one simple proposition"" and ""are the basic units of language behaviour"" (Lyons 1 977:633).
          The term ' simple sentences' used here approximates the abstract grammatical construct termed
     ' system-sentences', allowing, as Lyons ( I 977:626) suggests, that at least some part of their prosodic
     structure, including their intonation contour, be accounted for. Declarative, interrogative and imperative
     sentences are system-sentences with a particular grammatical structure. When system-sentences are
     contextualised by language speakers, they can be regarded as ""utterance-un its-to which such terms as
     ' statement', 'question', and 'command' are applicable ( 1 977:633).""
1 40   Chapter 44.95   Nu, avose,             kae+tarnb-ira=tano.
       3S that.CT.say.II poison+find.I-TP.3s.FN=perhaps
       ' He, well I ' m just not sure, perhaps he's gotten sick.'
In example 4.96, the speaker uses ta to express his annoyance with the addressee and with
the current state of affairs.
4.96   Ghaka beje-tira,           e    gi=ta!
       canoe break. I-TP.3S.FN this see.I.IMP.2S.AQ=FRUS
       'Now look at this (that you've done), the canoe's busted! '
   I n addition to the base, Korafe simple sentences may have initial peripheral segments,
one or more themes (P2), and a tail (P3). Initial peripheral segments usually occur sentence­
initially, but sometimes they follow the theme, as shown in example 4.95 . The initial
peripheral constituents include evaluative/pause words and vocatives. Examples of
evaluative (or pause) words are avori 'all right', avose 'perhaps', rnrn 'yes' and others.
Vocatives may follow evaluative words or be the initial segment in a sentence. They are
                                                                                        ,
either a person's name or kin relationship optionally followed by ko 'dear (honorific) or 0
'that (distal-2 used in declamations)' . Example 4.97 illustrates an evaluative peripheral
word followed by a vocative kin expression. The base is simply a predicate filled by a verb
in the hortative form.
4.97   Avori, nanda rnandi, yaore!
       all.right l S.GEN boy,      go.NDUR-IR.H . l PL.CR
       'All right, my boy, let's go ! '
   Like initial peripheral segments, themes are separated off by a pause from the rest o f the
sentence. In simple sentences, themes may either be NPs or PPs which may be additionally
marked by a topic marker (rno or va). Section 3 .2.3 . 1 provides fuller details and examples
of themes.
   Tails (P3) follow the sentence base. The tag words, ai 'yes ' , ai tefo 'yes or no' often
mark polar questions and are used along with prosodic features to distinguish them from
other sentence types. Examples are given in §4.7.2.3. Other examples of tail constituents
can be found in §3.2.3 . 1 .","[159, 160]"
"
4.7.2 SENTENCE TYPES
4.7.2 . 1 STATEMENTS
   Statements or declarative sentences are manifested by clauses that are unmarked by
distinguishing grammatical particles or constructions. Clauses terminating with either the
copula or final independent verb forms in the past tenses (other than third person singular
forms) are marked as definitely asserted by the speech act value marker { - i } . Clauses
terminating with present, future, and third person singular verb forms occur with the neutral
speech-act value marker {-a} . Declarative sentences occur with all the modal particles. The
speech-act value marker is apocopated when sentences terminate with the current relevancy
marker (ere/are/ore) and/or the reported speech evidential (asi).",[163]
"
19    An examination of the apparent anomalies in Korafe might give rise to the hypothesis that the lack of
      overt referential marking on ss medial verbs facilitates their use in these apparently anomalous cases.
      However, the default reading of these forms is ss following, and it is the very discrepancy in
      referential marking between what is expected and what actually occurs that signals the anomaly.
           This hypothesis is also discounted for many other Papuan languages, in which os medial verbs that
      are overtly marked are also used to register apparent anomalies. For instance, Roberts ( 1 988a: l 06-
      1 1 0) gives Amele examples where anomalies registered by os medial verbs express thematic breaks,
      i.e. shifts in time, place, and/or world settings and surprise changes.
           Korafe handles such thematic shifts by using left-dislocated NPs or PI'S as global themes marked by
      pragmatic topic markers (rna, va and iml) and followed by pauses.
           Olson ( 1 98 1 :298-306) describes several switch-reference markers (ga, gana, moga, koga) that have
      similar function in Barai. These markers indicate a switch of thematic topic, even when the local topic
      remains the same, and they often affect several clauses. They do not monitor switch-reference.
242      Chapter 7   Thus, it is not always the subject, the agent, or the topic that plays the pivotal role in
determining the marking of referential switches in Korafe S R Cs. Participant-centred
explanations that focus only on a pivotal NP are inadequate for explaining the total switch­
reference system in Korafe, which must include apparent anomalies as well. That is
because switch-reference expresses a relationship between clauses, not merely between
NPs. As Stirling ( 1 993 : 1 3 6) suggests, ""SR is a clause level function which does not deal
with the reference of NPs as such but with degrees and types of cohesion between
eventualities"".
   Five types of cohesion that produce ' event integration' (Givon 1 98 3 : 53-54, 1 987: 1 79,
1 990a:827) are: ( 1 ) referential continuity, (2) temporal continuity, (3) location continuity,
(4) action continuity and (5) thematic continuity. Continuity and discontinuity of reference,
temporality, and action play a major role in signalling relationships between clauses in the
Korafe switch-reference system.
  As was previously noted, continuity and discontinuity of syntactic subject referents is
encoded by the canonical switch-reference system.
    Temporal continuity or order is maintained in Korafe SRCs by both sequencing and
simultaneous medial verbs. The order of events in the real world imposes a temporal
' straitjacket' on the sequence of medial verbs encoding them. The use of simultaneous
medial verbs in the canonical system does not interrupt this order. The event signalled by a
simultaneous medial verb must commence before the event encoded by the verb in the
reference clause, so at its onset it preserves temporal iconicity. However, its terminus is
unspecified and overlaps with the subsequent event encoded by the reference clause.
   Like sequencing medial verbs, simultaneous medial verbs may not normally be reversed
without disturbing the temporal sequence. However, simultaneous medial verbs are the
only medial forms that may be freely reversed when they encode total overlap and are
coordinated by a conj unction that is a free form such as a ' and' and 0 ' o r '?O To indicate
total discontinuity or a complete reversaf 1 of temporal order, co-ranking structures with
final verbs must be used.
     Regarding action continuity, Givon ( 1 983 :54) suggests that:
        . . . action continuity is the domain of chaining verbs/predications one after
        another within the thematic paragraph in a way that coheres or makes temporal
        or causal sense.
  He adds, "" . . foreground clauses . . . tend to maintain the sequence of action continuity"".
For Korafe then, the canonical SRC is certainly the domain of foregrounded clauses. It has
been claimed (Labov and Waletzky 1 966: 20-2 1 ) that ""only independent clauses are20
        The ss and os indicators can be viewed as conjunctions, meaning 'and x' , ' while x, 'then x ' where x
        is an event encoded by the medial verb form. However, switch-reference indicators are bound forms;
        the conjunctions mentioned here are free forms, having a demonstrative base.
21
        Within the switch-reference system, it is possible to use a negative deverbal together with a medial
        form of iri 'remain ' followed by a temporal PP. This structure has the format: 'x remained not having
        happened. before that '. Technically, however, the correct temporal ordering is still preserved in this
        structure.
                                                                         Apparent anomalies in SRCs       243relevant to temporal sequences"" of narrative units. 22 However, there is a definite
resemblance between SRCs and the strings of independent narrative in clauses of English
(that Labov and Waletzky discussed). Like strings of narrative clauses in English, SRCS are
the major vehicle in Korafe for narration of events in temporal sequence, even though they
are primarily comprised of medial dependent clauses. The marking on medial verbs is
equivalent to English conjunctions 'and then' or 'and while'. In fact, the primary function
of the SRC is to indicate and maintain action continuity within narrative and procedural
discourses. Final independent verbs are used to interrupt action continuity, so there is the
potential for discontinuity of action or backgrounding at each occurrence of a final verb.
   Apparent anomalies signal an abrupt break between the marking and the reference
clauses. Whenever apparent anomalies occur, the marking clause registers continuity of
reference, temporal order, and/or continuity of action. However, the subsequent reference
clause indicates discontinuity. The event signalled by this clause does not have the same
subject referent, is out of temporal order with the previous event, and/or is an event off the
action line.
   Although discrepancies in subject referencing between clauses and differences in status
and temporality signal apparent anomalies, they do not provide their raison d 'etre. My
hypothesis is that apparent anomalies occur in the Korafe switch-reference system to
encode discontinuity of action in discourse. Giv6n ( 1 983 :54) links discontinuity of action
with background, stating: ""background clauses . . . tend to be outside the sequence of action
continuity . . . "" Hopper and Thompson ( 1 980:280) defme backgrounding as:
     That part of a discourse which does not immediately and crucially contribute to
     the speaker's goal, but which merely assists, amplifies, or comments on it, is
     referred to as BACKGROUND.
To explain how apparent anomalies function in Korafe, it is helpful to distinguish two basic
types of background: 'off-line background' and 'on-line background,?3
22    Interpreting Labov, Waletzky and Reinhart, Thompson ( 1 987:442) states: ""According to Labov and
      Waletzky and Reinhart, the foreground (narratives) clauses must not be syntactically dependent"". That
      would exclude Korafe medial verb clauses from being foregrounded clauses. However, Pawley
      (personal communication) counters: ""I suspect medial verb clauses would qualify as ' independent' in
      Labov' s and Waletsky' s sense. They were concerned to exclude embedded clauses and clauses of
      reason, condition, etc. which broke up the iconic ordering of narrative clauses. True medial clauses are
      'dependent', but they don't break up iconic ordering (usually)"".
          Hopper and Thompson ( 1 984 : 74 1 -742) also express two opposing ideas about chaining
      constructions. They suggest: ""THE 'CHAINING' CONSTRUCTION is a term for a sequence of real is clauses
      in which only the final one is presented as foregrounded"". However, they go on to say: ""not all medial
      v's show less categoriality than their [mal counterparts: in many Papuan languages, medial v's which
      are 'coordinate' with the following v typically do not mark tense and mood independently, but ones
      which are 'subordinate' to the final v do mark these categories. This apparent paradox suggests that
      chained clauses are typically in a part-whole relationship to some higher discourse unit...""
23    Others have also noted that the m ismatched reference clause, termed S 2, can be interpreted as
      background information. Hairnan ( 1 985 : 82-83, 92), drawing on comments from Longacre ( 1 972),
      Marlett ( 1 98 ) ), and Gordon ( 1 983), suggests that it is appropriate to interpret S 2 as backgrounded
      information for Hua. Reesink ( 1 983:235) uses terms like 'setting' and 'reasonable necessary condition
      for them.' Roberts ( 1 988a: 1 1 4) suggests that this segment is ""bracketed off...as background material
      or a subordinate theme"".
         Thelin ( 1 990:25-3 ) ) discusses two types of background: actual background and proper background.
      Actual background has the feature [+TIMEJ or ""temporally definite. (related directly to state-changing
                                                                          ..
244    Chapter 7   ' Off-line background' includes all events that are not temporally ordered within the
time frame for the main event line of the SRC. Korafe embedded constructions, both those
that terminate with a fmal verb and purpose constructions, are ' off-line background' in
discourses.
   ' On-line background' is temporally ordered within the time frame for the main SRC
event line. Unlike 'off-line background' constructions which often can be moved to other
places in the sentence, the order of the mismatched clause encoding 'on-line background'
cannot be reversed with clauses preceding or following it. The mismatched clauses
described in this chapter belong to 'on-line background' . An emotion or physiological
change of state impinges on the main participant, but does not take the focus off him or her.
Apparent anomalies in the system relegate temporal, meteorological or circumstantial
events to settings. In both of these cases, the mismatched clause is temporally synchronised
with the main event line, but the speaker or author has chosen to use apparently anomalous
SS marking to represent the mismatched clause as part of the background that supports the
main event line rather than being a main line event itself. As for the temporal mismatch
type, one would think that the mismatched clause should have a position on the main event
line, since it does focus on a significant discourse entity, explaining the complication that
entity introduces into the discourse. However, this participant or entity is experienced or
seen through the eyes of another major participant that has his or her role in clauses that do
express the main event line. At no time is this temporally mismatched clause given its own
separate temporal status on the main event line.
   Let us return to the analogy of the stage play. Concepts like the 'narrator', 'actors' , the
'spotlight', ' stage sets or backdrops' , and positions such as 'centre-stage' , 'down-stage', in
the 'orchestra pit', 'before the curtains' can all be used to explain how apparent anomalies
operate.
   Embedded sentences that encode 'off-line' background material are like the sections of
the play that the narrator reads either in the orchestra pit, off to one side, or in front of the
curtain.
   Mismatches expressing 'on-line' background are represented as events or states that
actually are played out or have a place on the stage. Those involving physiological or
psychological responses are like those segments that are read by the narrator off to one side
or in the orchestra pit at the same time as the actor standing frontstage and centre stage is
miming them in his or her facial expressions and body gestures.
   Mismatches encoding temporal, meteorological or circumstantial settings are like stage
sets or backdrops on the stage.
   In mismatches involving narrative backtracking to pick up some missing strands of the
story, the participant whose activities are encoded by the main event line is like the actor
who remains in the spotlight at all times. The participant involved in one or more events on
the secondary event line is like an actor who performs his role downstage and out of the      foreground events)"". Proper background with the feature [-T I ME] is 'temporally indefinite' or not
      specifically defmed in tenns of time. Thelin applies these background types to English and Russian,
      but I am unsure how his definitions match with the Korafe background types. Therefore, I am using
      the tenns 'on-line background' and 'off-line background'.
                                                             Apparent anomalies in SRCs   245spotlight, except when the spotlighted actor moves near enough for the spotlight to
encompass both of them.
   In the same way, the thematically prominent NP in bracketing structures corresponds to
the actor frontstage and centre stage with the spotlight on him or her. The subject of the
bracketed clause corresponds to the actor downstage who is only in the spotlight when the
actor being spotlighted moves into proximity with him or her.
   Likewise, partitioning is like narrowing the focus of the spotlight from two actors to the
prominent one in this event.
   The speaker or author is like the playwright who plans the production, the technical
production manager who handles the spotlight, the stage hands who move the stage sets
into place and the narrator who orchestrates all the entrances and exits of the actors. He or
she makes and executes all the staging decisions. In the process, the switch-reference
system gets used in two ways. Morphosyntactically, it sets up formal and semantic relations
between clauses, that enable the speaker to reference events iconically and to keep track of
subject referents. Pragmatically, it provides a way for the speaker to create scenes that
represent the world from his or her perspective, foregrounding significant events that carry
the action forward in a discourse and backgrounding supporting material.

                                    CO-RANKING STRUCTURES   Languages containing chaining structures, particularly those with switch-reference, are
often presented as being rather exotic. However, chaining structures are not the only type
Korafe has. The co-ranking structures, discussed in this chapter, behave similarly to
structures which have several verbs of the same rank predicating each clause in the
sentence in English and other Indo-European languages.
   A co-ranking sentence (CRS) 1 has as its primary constituents two or more bases of the
same rank. 2 Such bases can either be clauses or clause sequences that act as a unit (e.g.
SRCs or other C R SS). They terminate with a final verb, a copula or a predicate in a
topic-{;omment clause without the copula.
  Example S . l is a CRS with two main bases ( 1 and 2), but each of the main bases is
multiclausal. (Note that EC stands for an embedded clause.)

         that.cT+say.I.SEQ.SS

      Longacre ( 1 985:238) uses the term 'co-ranking structures' to refer to structures which combine ""verbs
      of the same rank"". These clauses are often joined by conjunctions, e.g. 'and', 'but', 'or' in English.
          Technically, a sentence is minimally a clause plus prosodic features. In the case of written text, the
      prosodic features are represented by punctuation. Combinations of clauses are 'clause complexes'
      (Halliday 1 985 : 1 92-193) until prosodic features are assigned to them. However, as applied to Korafe,
      the term 'co-ranking structures' is used interchangeably with 'co-ranking sentences', and the term
      'sentence' is used for clauses and clause sequences that terminate with an independent final verb.
      Clause sequences that do not terminate with an independent final verb are not sentences.
2     The definition of 'base' as a clause or clause sequence that is a primary constituent of a sentence
      follows Bruce's ( 1 984:26 1 -263) explanation of the term. Adverbial clauses and other clauses that are
      phonologically distinct from the independent base are considered to be sentence bases.
          Longacre ( 1 985:284, 235-237) uses the term 'base' in a much more restricted sense to refer to
      structures which are ""a functional subpart of a nucleus"" of the sentence. He distinguishes sentence
      'margins', which normally contain adverbial clauses, from 'bases' . Thus, for h im, co-ranking
      structures are limited to bases in paratactic relationship with each other. [n this work, bases which
      have terminal verbs of the same rank (Le. fmal verbs) are CRSs. This includes bases in either paratactic
      or hypotactic relationship. Thus, the defmition of CRS used here is much broader than Longacre's.
          Not all clauses or clause sequences are bases in CRSs. Structurally, embedded c lauses and
      sequences of clauses that act as a unit (e.g. SRCS) terminate with fmal verbs, but they function as NPs
      or constituents ofNPs and are phonologically bound to the matrix clause in which they are embedded.
      They are, therefore, not primary constituents (bases) of CRSS.","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266]"

8.9.2 INDIRECT QUOTES
   Indirect quotes usually have two components : the indirect quote and the speech-act
formula.
   Indirect quote constructions are differentiated into four structural types by their word
order, their intonational pattern, the type of predicating constituent and by the
complementiser that embeds them. In only one of the types is the indirect quotation
phonologically separate from the speech-act base. Usually it is the dependent base in
hypotactic relationship with the speech-act base. The other three embed as complements in
the dominant or matrix clause and have the following structures: ( 1 ) the indirect quote
terminates with a positive deverbal form followed by a, va, or ava that embeds them, (2)
the indirect quote is a purpose construction embedded by dae in a matrix clause with a form
of se ' say ', and (3) the indirect quote either is a topic-comment clause without the copula
or it terminates with a final dependent verb followed by va or a demonstrative form, and is
phonologically linked to the speech-act formula. (A fuller explanation of the deverbal and
purpose construction types is found in § 3 . 1 .6. l and §7.2.2.)
   In example 8.66 an indirect quote that is an embedded complement is contrasted with an
indirect quote that is not embedded within the speech-act clause. In 8.66a two speech­
act/mental-process bases bracket the indirect quote uvu kafuruva 'the water was deep
water', which is an object complement of the verb setira 'he said' . The complementiser va
signals that the indirect quote (topic-comment structure) is not true.
8.66a.     Nu kate-tira            amo,       uvu         kafuru=va   se-tira.
           3S think.I-TP.3S.FN that.TIF water deep.water=CT say.I-TP .3S.FN
           ' He thought that the water was deep. (And it wasn't.)'
The indirect quote in example 8.66b is phonologically separate from the speech act base.
This quote gives true information.
                                                                                      eRSs   2798.66b.     Nu kote-tira            amo,       uvu   kafuru=ri.
           3S think.I-TP.3S.FN that.TIF water deep.water=coP.AQ
           ' He thought that the water was deep. (And it was.)'
   When the indirect quote precedes the speech-act formula, it is quite often embedded as
the object complement of the speech-act or mental-process verb. However, in example
8.67, the indirect quote comprises a sentence base that is phonologically separate from the
sentence base that contains the mental process.
8 .67

         I S NEG knowledge+not.do=cOP.AQ
        , . . . where I left the canoe, I did not know. '
Pronominal reference in indirect quotes mirrors the external context of the discourse. As
8.67 shows, the narrator uses first person pronouns for self-reference : na ' I ' in the speech
act/mental process base and first person singular marking on dotutusena 'I left ' .
   Second person forms are used for those that the narrator i s addressing. All discourse­
internal participants are referenced by third person pronouns. The second person genitive
pronoun in the indirect quote of example 8.68 refers to the person the narrator i s
addressing. The third person pronoun references the discourse-internal speaker.

8. 1 0 SENTENTIAL COMPLEMENTS IN CRSs
   Sentential complements that occur in CRSs have theme function in the sentence. Unlike
many complements, they are not embedded in the independent terminal base, but they
occur as a dependent initial base that is phonologically distinct from and in hypotactic
relationship with the terminal base. The complement is predicated by a dependent final
verb, which is usually followed by a demonstrative.
  Korafe complements encode : ( 1 ) indirect quotations or mental processes, (2)
evaluations, (3) final cause (or purpose) and (4) habitual acts. Embedded complements that
express evaluations or habitual acts are discussed in §3 . 1 .6. 1 . Section 7.2 gives
complements that encode purpose. Section 8.9.2 describes and illustrates indirect quotes.
  This section illustrates complements in CRSs that encode evaluation. As examples 8 .69
and 8.70 illustrate, amo 'that' is usually the demonstrative complementiser for sentential
complements in evaluations.

         ' That he went away is good.' (He was a bad influence in our community.)
     In 8.70 the initial thematic complement contains two alternative bases. The second
alternative base is a multi-clausal SRC. The thematic complement has the evaluation evevari
               , 2
' (it) is good . 0 The entire sentence is a polar question that requests the addressee to
evaluate the alternatives.

4.4.2 PERCEPTION AND FEELING PREDICATIONS
   Perceptions are expressed by a small group of two-place predicates which occur with
either agent or experiencer semantic roles as subject and object-theme as object. Verbs
predicating perception clauses include: gi ' see, look at' , ningi ' hear, listen to, obey ' ,
kasame e 'know, learn' , bune 'not know' , itatame ' feel, touch' , tambu ' meet up with, look
for', kote 'think', tumonde 'believe, trust' , dubo bu ' love ' , uju e ' want', oju e ' fear, be
afraid of . In example 4.53, the syntactic subject is an agent [+volition, +control] overtly
present as an NP in the initial clause and co-referenced on the verb of perception, gosudo
(aira) 'he went along looking at' .
4.53   ... kora=da   ata+kotu aminda              gosu-do       a-ira
           beach=LOC foot+print that.TIF.CEFF.LOC see.II-SEQ.SS go.NDUR-TP.3S.FN
       noaro=kena          buvu-do . . .
       3S.wife=ALOC arrive. I-SEQ.SS
       ' . . . he went along the beach looking at the footprints and approached his wife . . .      '
The subject of example 4.54 is an experiencer [-control, -volition], one who merely
receives the information.
4.54   Na binD ningi-do          dudukughe-do            ghamo keinghu-sira.

       'I heard the news and was surprised and was startled out of my wits. '
   The object of perception verbs is sometimes a sentential complement. The complement
is underlined in example 4.55. As the comma indicates, the pause between the two bases in
                                             ,
this sentence follows ava 'that (contrastive) .

       kasama+ae =ri.
       knowledge+not.do=CoP .AQ
       ' . . .1 didn't know where I left the canoe. '
   With the verbal lexeme oju e 'fear, be afraid o f and occasionally with uju e 'want', the
object is marked by the benefactive-purpose postposition dae 'on account of .
4.56   Namane evetu+genembo vuvuji=dae                     oju+e-raera.

       ' We people are afraid of centipedes.'
1 26     Chapter 4Purpose and negative purpose or apprehension constructions marked by the complementiser
dae ' on account of are often sentential complements of uju e 'want' and oju e ' fear'
respectively. These constructions are more fully discussed in §7.2.2.

4.4.3 IMPERSONAL EXPERiENTIAL PREDICATIONS
   Korafe has a set of impersonal experiential predications that encode involuntary
physiological and emotional responses. 'Impersonal constructions' are so-called because
any entity that could be construed as controlling or motivating the response is non­
volitional and non-personal. These impersonal predications have the following
characteristics:
( 1 ) up to three entities may be indicated by overt NPs. They are: (a) an animate entity,
      usually human, who experiences the affecting stimulus and responds, (b) the body part
      affected, and (c) the emotion or bodily response. 7
(2) the animate entity making the response is not cross-referenced on the verb as subject,
    and is not in control of its response. Its syntactic status is discussed in detail below.
(3) the verbal predicate invariably cross-references a third person singular subject,
    regardless of the person and number of the overt NPs.
   Physiological responses have three common components: ( 1 ) an animate entity (often
represented by a personal pronoun), (2) an optional body part (represented by an NP such as
jiro 'head') and (3) a body response which has a verbal component (i.e. merna resira ' it is
hurting (lit. it is saying pain)').
        physiological response: (1) animate entity (2) (body part) (3) body response+V
    Emotional responses have two basic components: ( 1 ) an animate entity and (2) an
emotion usually expressed in a nominal+verb combination (i.e. dubo merna erira 'he or she
is sad (lit. he or she/it is doing neck pain)').
        emotional response: ( 1 ) animate entity (2) emotion+V
   Examples 4.58, 4.59, and 4.60 typify physiological responses. In each of these cases, a
human entity (na ' I ' or namane 'we') is the initial element labelled ( 1 ) in the predication.
The second element labelled (2) is the body part involved : jiro 'head' or ala ' leg' . The third
element labelled (3) is the bodily response.
4.58      ( 1 ) Na           (2) jiro         (3) sarig-er-ira.
                IS                 head             split- IPF PRES.3S. FN

       Roberts ( l 988a: 1 00) documents both for Amele, a Papuan language from the Madang Province.
                                                     Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences    1 27   Example 4 . 5 8 has two overt N P arguments na ' 1 ' and jiro ' head', the response is
registered by the verb sarigerira ' it is splitting' . Example 4.59a has the same two overt
arguments as 4.58, but a verbal lexeme (nominal + verb: mema resira ' it hurts (lit. says
pain)') indicates the bodily response.
4.59a. ( 1 ) Na        (2) jiro           (3) mema+re-s-ira.
             IS               head              pain+IPF-say-PRES.3S.FN
       'I have a headache. (lit. lime head is saying pain.)'
It is possible to use a possessive pronoun with some body parts in a sentence like 4.59a.
The word ungo 'armlhand' shown in 4.59b illustrates this.
4.59b. ( 1 ) Nanda      (2) ungo       (3) mema+re-s-ira.

       ' My arm is hurting (lit. saying pain).'
In some cases, there is no body part included, just the bodily response, ighoi etiri ' it did
hunger' or 'hunger did' in (4.60).
4.60   . . . vare+begata=da semb+i-se,

       ' . . . as (we) were crossing on the garden path, we got hungry and. . . '
   Predications indicating emotional responses pattern like example 4.6 1 have two basic
elements: ( 1 ) the animate entity and (3) the emotion.
4.6 1 a. ( 1 ) Na   (3) dubo+mema+er-ira.
               IS       neck+pain+IPF-do.PRES.3S.FN
         'I am overcome with grief. '
Unlike the physiological examples given above, the body part and the bodily response are
not separate entities.8 Instead, they form a compound nominal unit in Korafe, i .e. dubo
mema 'worry, grief, problem (lit. neck pain) ' . Example 4.61 b is ungrammatical.
4.61b. *(1 ) Nanda dubo mema                er-ira.
             I S.GEN neck pain              IPF-do.PRES.3S.FN
       'I am overcome with grief. '
8   There are contexts where it is acceptable to encode physiological responses by an animate entity
    possessing the body part. For example, Najiro mema resira 'I have a headache' can be changed to:
        Nanda jiro mema re-s-ira,                        nanange atimb-aoni?
        I S.GEN head pain          IPF-say-PRES.3S.FN do.how.! carry.slung.on.head-H. I S.AQ
        'My head is aching, how ever will I carry that stringbag slung on my head?'
    Most Korafe lexemes conveying emotions are metaphors composed of a body part (e.g. dubo 'neck') that
    co-lexicalises with a qualifier or a body response. After combination, these lexemes are inseparable. Na
    dubo mema erira ' I am sad (lit. lime neck pain it is doing)' cannot be changed to *Nanda dubo mema
    erira ' my neck is doing pain', nor is it possible to insert a negative focus marker, *Nanda dubo jQ mema
    aeri. But dubo mema 'worry, sadness' can be used as a nominal compound:
        Nanda dubo+mema=mo evi=ri.
        I S.GEN neck+pain=T1F          this.CT=COP.AG
        ' My problem, (well, it) is this.'
1 28     Chapter 4This nominal compound can either be regarded as a complement incorporated into the stem
of a verbal lexeme (nominal + verb) or a separate NP argument if expanded into a full NP
with modifiers, e.g. dubo merna feria beM ' very great grief .
   It should be noted that the animate entity experiencing the emotion is sometimes cross­
referenced as the verb.
4.62      ( 1 ) Na (3) dubo+mema+er-ena.
                IS      neck+pain+IPF-do.PRES. I S.FN
          'J am upset over this(lit. I am doing neck pain). ' (And I ' m going to stay that way.)The semantic difference between examples 4 . 6 1 a and 4.62 is one of control . The
impersonal rendering in 4.6 1 a registers an involuntary emotion, something that over­
whelms the animate experiencer. In example 4.62, the animate entity controls the emotion,
choosing to nurse it over a period of time or even to generate it in his mind.
   The syntactic function of the animate entity experiencing the bodily process or emotion
cannot be conclusively established in Korafe. It could quite possibly have object function,
because it is an unmarked non-subject argument.9 If that were the case, the clause in the
impersonal experiential construction would have OSV as its normal order. It should be noted
that unlike other clauses manifesting O S V order, in this construction, the putative S
constituent is never marked with the effector of change marker imi.
   In fact, there are no clear grammatical criteria for identifying the subj ect of the
impersonal experiential construction, beyond the third person singular subject agreement
marker on the verb. There are at least three posssibilities regarding the identification of a
subject. 10
( 1 ) The body part affected or the bodily response NP when they are not incorporated in the
      verb are the subject.
(2) Some unspecified (in most cases) stimulus triggering the response is the subject.
(3) There is no subject. If this solution is adopted, it could apply globally to all cases.
  Assigning semantic roles to arguments in these predications is also problematic. The
most plausible role designation for the animate entity is experiencer, and for the body part9      In those Papuan languages that do mark the verb for object agreement, it is clear that the animate entity
       is cross-referenced as the object. (See Roberts 1 988a:97, Reesink 1 983 :232-233, and Olson 1 98 1 :296-
       298.)
10
       Stirling ( 1 993 :242-243) gives a fourth explanation for impersonal constructions in Amele, involving a
       'dummy subject'. Rejecting Roberts' (forthcoming:77) solution that ""incorporated nominals"" encoding
       emotions are co-referenced as subject, she ( 1 993 :242-243) cites the occurrence of the 'pseudo-passive'
       in Amele as support for setting up a third person singular ' dummy subject'.
            However, one cannot claim precedence for a dummy subject from the pseudo-passive set in Korafe,
       because Korafe uses a third person plural, not singular, form for the pseudo-passive, as jitoro 'they put'
       below shows .
         ... 'telephone exchange ' nanange-do         jit-oro             Popondetta ghe-do

rather than an experiencer has subject function in impersonal predications encoding
physiological responses. This reverses the subject-accessibility hierarchy, referred to in
§3.2.2 . 1 , in which experiencer is selected as subject before patient. The fact is, though, that
the animate entity never has subject function in impersonal predications. It does, however,
have the genitive circumstantial role in some predications expressing physiological
responses (see example 4.59b).
   The question before us is what the third person subject marking on the verb is agreeing
with. Let us briefly consider each of the syntactic alternatives along with some semantic
alternatives.
   1 . In physiological responses, the most likely candidate for syntactic subject is the body
part experiencing the response. In examples 4.58 and 4.59a, this NP is a body part, jiro
'head', and in 4.59b ungo ' hand ' . It agrees in person with the third person subject
agreement marking on the verb. However, as plural marking never occurs in such
constructions this fact is not diagnostic. In terms of the semantic relations between
constituents, this body part NP encodes the most likely entity experiencing the response. I I
   Physiological or emotional responses (e.g. ighoi etiri 'got hungry' in example 4.60 and
dubo merna erira 'felt grief) can be considered to be incorporated into the verb. However,
when the nominal is modified as in ighoi ambarako etiri 'got extremely hungry' and dubo
merna teria bekQ erira ' is totally overwhelmed by grief , it is certainly a third person
singular form with which the verb could agree.
   2. Viewing an unspecified external stimulus as the subject would scarcely be feasible if
there were no cases where a stimulus is specified. However, in example 4.63, a stimulus is
specified. The flounder's biting the narrator is the external stimulus provoking the vexation

In this case the stimulus would be treated similarly to the way the initial event in clause
sequences encoding completive aspect is treated. In example 4.63b the subject of dadabetiri
'it finished' is the event,furu dighero 'they lashed the fence'.

     Roberts ( 1 988a: 1 00) treats body parts as subjects in Amele impersonal experiential constructions where
     they occur.
1 30      Chapter 4   In the same way , it is possible that the subject of dubo eko etiri '(I) got angry (lit. it did
anger)' is the event gambiri ' it bit (me)' .
   I f this option were chosen, 1 2 one could posit the fol lowing two revised sets o f
participatory arguments for impersonal experiential predications. This solution would allow
the physiological response to be an object, either incorporated in the verb or a separate
constituent from the verb, having the same syntactic role in the cases illustrated in
examples 4.6 1 a and 4.62. 1 3 Physiological response predications would have the following
semantic roles : locus, patient and/or force , and object-theme (where the nominal is a
separate N P ). Emotional response predications would have these arguments: experiencer,
force, and object-theme (where the nominal is a separate N P).
   3 . If the final option were adopted, it could apply globally to all cases, including the
ones where only an animate entity and a nominal+verb combination exist, e.g. 4.60 and
4.6 1 a, in which there is no NP overtly present in the clause that would trigger subject
agreement. However, this option is controversial. Subject is considered by many to be an
indispensable element in a complete sentence. 14
   To sum up, the evidence is divided. Where a body part is present in physiological
responses, it is a reasonable candidate for subject. Option (2) is attractive , but there are too
few instances where a stimulus is specified to provide conclusive evidence.
    These impersonal experiential predications are somewhat unusual in that subject and
topic are maintained as distinct entities. The animate entity is the topic constituent in this
construction, corresponding to P I in the formula P I SOY (Dik 1 978 :20-2 1 ) . Since it never
has subject function, this animate entity cannot be realised by the focal actor pronoun, as
illustrated in 4.64a. Example 4.64b likewise demonstrates that it cannot be emphasised by
t% 'self which marks an actor taking credit for an accomplishment.
4.64a. *Nane       ighoi+er-ira.
          I S.ACT hunger+IPF -do.PRES.3S.FN

         I S self   hunger+I PF-do.P RE S.3S. FN
       'I myself am making myself hungry. '
Since the animate entity has topic function , it obligatorily precedes the negative focus
markerjo.
4.65a. Na jo     ighoi+ae=ri.
       I S NEG hunger+not.do=COP.AQ
       'I'm not hungry. ' or 'Nothing is making me hungry.'","[145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150]"

3 .2.3.3 OTHER MORPHOLOGICAL MARKERS OF PRAGMATIC CONSTITUENTS
   The following morphological markers also indicate pragmatic constituents: ( 1 ) current
relevancy markers and ani, (2) modal thematic markers (asi and ta), (3) personal pronouns
including focal actor pronominal set, (4) interrogative pronouns and other forms, and (5)
contrastive specifiers (jo and nu).
   The current relevancy marker re 'here is, currently in focus' marks THEME NPs, given
information the speaker assumes is ""already activated"" (Chafe 1 976:30) in the mind of the
addressee. The noun phrases or noun clauses marked by re are part of the gestural or
symbolic deictic context of the speech act, as illustrated in 3 . 1 3 8 .
3 . 1 3 8 Dudley=re,          a=ni         buva=ghae, a=vo=ri.
          Dudley=COP.here that=COP.there scar=COM.D that=CT=COP.AQ
          ' Dudley here (you want to know which of the twins is Dudley), he' s that
          one with the scar, that one.'
   The modal markers asi ' that certainly was said (reported speech) ' and ta 'unexpectedly,
frustratingly' follow final verbs. They also mark THEME NPs, as shown in examples 3 . 1 39
and 3 . 1 40.
3 . 1 39 Father=masi,              bagia+kato=ri.
         Father=T/F.that.sayJI thief+repeated.doer=coP.AQ
         ' Father, they certainly say, is a thief.'
3 . 1 40 A =mo=ta,        ir-ira                  a=mo!
         that=T/F=FRUS remain-PRES.3S.FN that=TIF
         ' There, you ninny, it' s right over there (near you) ! '
1 08    Chapler 3   Personal pronouns signal contrast, marking the referential animate NP as the significant
one in a set. Two sets of pronouns have pragmatic FOCUS function: ( 1 ) the exclusive focal
actor set with -ne and the (2) exclusive focal experiencer set with -mo+a. Like { imi} , the
exclusive focal actor personal pronoun set (nane ' I myself, nine 'you, yourself , nune 'he
himself , and nene ' they themselves') marks its referent as the specific initiator of the
action encoded by the verbal predicate. However, unlike { im i } , this set is restricted to
clause-internal function, as syntactic subject, semantic AGENT, and pragmatic FOCUS. This
set must be used when a personal pronoun has subject function in an osv-ordered clause.
Therefore, example 3 . 1 4 1 b is ill-formed.
3 . 1 4 1 a. Na nune        de-lira.              b.   *Na nu de-tira.
             I S 3S.ACT hiu-TP.3S.FN                      I S 3S hit. l-TP.3S.FN
             ' It was he that hit me. '                * ' 1 he hit. '
This set indicates the focal actor in both transitive (3. 1 4 1 ) and intransitive (3 . 1 42) clauses.
3 . 1 42 Randall nune        i-sira.
         Randall 3S.ACT go. DUR-DP.3S.FN
         ' It was Randall himself that went. (He'll represent us well.)'
The pronominal referent undergoing some action can be singled out by adding mo+a to the
pronominal root forms, as illustrated by namoa 'me myself in example 3 . 1 43 .
3 . 1 43 Nu na=mo=a de-lira.
         3S I S=TIF=that hit.I-TP.3S.FN
         ' It was me that he hit! '
   I nterrogative p ronouns and other interrogative forms have FOC U S function in
clauses or sentence bases, drawing the accent of the intonation contour to their inherently
stressed syllable, as examples 4. 1 04 and 4. 1 05 illustrate.
   The negation marker jo ' not' is a contrastive specifier that immediately precedes the
focused constituent in the clause or takes the accent in the intonation contour and is itself
the focused constituent. Its function and distribution are detailed more fully in §4.6.
   When the contrastive specifier n ll occurs as THEME, it signals the topic for discussion
that the speaker is selecting out of a range of possible topics, as in example 3 .98 above.
When nu follows the TOPIC in a clause that is part of the initial base in a sentence, it marks
that base as the one contrastively focused on. In example 3 . 1 44, the speaker is correcting a
misapprehension of the addressee, by marking the event he knows occurred, contrasting it
with the non-event which he believes the addressee thinks occurred.
3 . 1 44 Nu nu kambo=da a-ira,                             a=va=ta            vikoko
         3S � house=LOC go.NDUR-TP.3S.FN                   that=CT=FRUS(=but) knife
       jo      b-ae=ri.
       NEG get.I-not.do=coP.AQ
        ' He did go to the house (it' s true), but he didn't get the bush knife.'
   This specifier is further discussed in § 8 . 1 2.

               CLAUSES, PREDICATES, PREDICATIONS AND SENTENCES4. 1 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
   This chapter surveys Korafe clauses/predications and briefly outlines the structure and
intonation patterns of simple sentences.
   Clauses roughly correspond to the semantic notion of full predications, i.e. predications
with both participatory and circumstantial semantic arguments. The predication types
detailed in the following sections are based on the correspondence between the number of
core arguments that can occur and the semantic roles these arguments play. Predication
types in Korafe are either stative or active. Non-verbal clauses and clauses with iri ' remain'
express states of affairs. Other verbal predicates express events, the verb stem being an
""event classifier: a verb stem denoting a kind of action [or process] , conceptually simple or
complex"" (Pawley 1 987:33 5-3 36).
   Simple sentences have two basic components: a base with accompanying prosodies.
Because the base of a simple sentence corresponds syntactically to a clause and
semantically to a predication, predication types are presented first in the fol lowing
discussion. The simple sentences surveyed in the final section of this chapter are:
statements, content questions, polar questions, and commands.","[127, 128, 129]"
"27   The morphological form and semantic configuration of this paradigm support the hypothesis that the
     negative deverbal ae 'not do' and the today's past form of the verb 'do': {eteni} are its components.
50     Chapter 2   Deontic wishes and obligations as well as polite requests are also expressed by this
paradigm. Example 2.69 expresses a strong recommendation.

imperfective morpheme { -uru} , as in:

2.4. 1 0 HORTATIVE MOOD: STEM I + {-ONE}
   Hortative forms differ from others in that the basic speech-act value marker is -e,
marking the speaker' s desire for the event to occur immediately. The positive hortative
paradigm is illustrated below. Verbs with Y or CY stem I forms (e.g. se 'say' and gi 'see')
occur with an initial -a integrated with the first person and all plural suffixes.
                                                                                Karale verbs   51       Person       ' say'          ' enter'         ' see'          ' write'

   Hortative verb forms are predicates of the final clause in sentences encoding suggestions
that have only one base, composed of one (2.71 a) or more clauses (2. 7 1 b).
2.71    a. Y-aare!                    b. Y-a                   b-aare!

           ' Let' s go ! '               ' Let' s go and get it! '
  They also are predicates of the clause in the second base in sentences such as 2.72, in
which the first base has as its predicate an imperative form of the verb.
2.72    Jruru,           namane y-aare!
        gO.IPF.RED.IMP I PL.EXC gO.DUR-H. I PL.CR
        ' Get going on your way, and we'll be going shortly.'
   Some speakers use this positive hortative suffix set to encode -dae purpose constructions
outlined in § 7.2.2. 1 , but most speakers use the sequencing irrealis medial set (§2.5.2.4).","[69, 70, 71]"
"
6.2.2 OPERATION OF ONE PROPOSITIONAL VALUE OVER SRCs
  The SRC functions as a sentential unit, either as a presupposition 1 1 or as a proposition
with illocutionary force. In the latter case, only one illocutionary act is performed when the
SRC is uttered. This illocutionary act can be either ( 1 ) a statement, (2) a question, or (3) a
command. An SRC cannot contain both a statement and a command, as some co-ranking11    The term 'presupposition' is used here to refer to something the speaker assumes as given for the
      context in which he or she makes his utterance. This pretheoretical defmition is basically pragmatic,
      opposing presuppositions with assertion. It is not a ' semantic' notion, defmed in terms of truth­
      conditions, opposing presuppositions with entailments (Lyons 1 977:600).
1 90     Chapter 6sentences do. The same interactive features that indicate the illocutionary force of a simple
sentence illustrate the illocutionary force of an SRC. These features (discussed in §4.7) are
reviewed here and illustrated.
( 1 ) The SRC can contain one and only one dependent or independent final verb, marked by
      a speech-act-value marker, {-i}, -a, or -e in accordance with the specifications given in
      §2.3.3.
(2) The frequency and amplitude contours in the rhythm group(s) assigned to the SRC
    follow the patterns illustrated in §4.7 and its subsections for statements, content
    questions, commands, and polar questions or they terminate with a fal ling rising
    intonation contour which characterises presuppositional material. Pauses can occur SRC
    internally.
(3) Only one modal particle (or two tag words, e.g. ai te/o 'yes no?') can occur at SRC
    terminus; they cannot occur SRC internally. Only one evaluative word, such as avose
    ' perhaps' , may occur sentence-initially or after the subject NP in the initial clause.
    Pause words, such as avori 'all right' can occur several times in an SRC .
   The following SRC has the illocutionary force of a statement. The epistemic modal asi
'thus said' occurs at its terminus. It contains two clauses, which fall under the scope of one
rhythm group with five intonation contours: ( 1 ) na (2) ya-ma (3) a- (4) -fa (5) ga-re-na-si.
6. 1 7    Na y-ama                         a/a    g-aren-asi.
          I S go.DUR-SEQ.IR. SS.EMP father See.l-F . I s.FN-that.say.II
          ' I will go and see father, that was said! '
In auditory analysis, the a in a/a 'father' was considered to be the accented syllable in the
utterance. In the instrumental analysis, however, the ya in yama ' (I ) will go' was the
longest syllable at 3 1 8 milliseconds, the loudest syllable in the first clause at 83.3(- 1 .6dB),
and was given the highest pitch in the utterance: 1 78.5 Hz. The a in a/a was given the
highest pitch in the second clause: 1 72.5 Hz. The re in garenasi ' I will see, that was said'
was the loudest syllable in the utterance at 93 .0(-0.6dB) and the longest syllable in the
second clause, enduring 226 milliseconds.","[209, 210]"
"
9.2. 1 FIXED AND SEMIPRODUCTIVE SPEECH FORMULAS
   Fixed speech formulas (formulas that do not vary in lexical content or word order) in
Korafe are exemplified by the greeting Sifo eveva! 'Good day ! (lit. day good)' , a calque on
the English expression. Fixed formulas used for expressing gratitude are: A iyakoe!
'Thanks ! ' and A iyakoe bekti resena! ' Thank you very much! ' . The telling of a legend
begins with the fixed formula Kiki! ' Story ! ' and Kiki aghata bamba! 'tall tale ! ' concludes
them.
   Semiproductive formulas occurring with severe constraints on the variation include both
traditional greetings and farewells in Korafe. Some common greetings are given in 9. 1 3 .
9. 1 3   a. R-av-asi!             b.   Ir-esa!                 c.   Re-f-esa!
            IPF-sleep-NP.2S.AQ         remain-PRES.2S .FN           JPF-come-PRES.2S.FN
            ' You slept ! '            ' You are staying! '         ' You are coming ! '
Only second person forms are used in these greetings. They are statements, not questions or
commands, that must occur with near past tense for ravasi! 'you slept' and present tense for
the other forms. In addition to their discourse function as a greeting, they often signal the
initial discourse utterance or the initial response in a dialogue. Movements, such as the third
greeting encodes, can be SVSs encoding direction + motion, such as: Viti refesa! ' You are
coming up.' and Sembu refesa! ' You are coming across (the surface crossed is usually the
fiord)' .
  Farewells are also standardised. However, they are not statements, l iterally, but
commands. The most common farewells are:
9. 1 4   a. Anumbe-y-o!             b. Yasi-y-o!                 c. Avi-y-o!
            sit.IMP-EPEN-STEN          gO.lMP-EPEN-STEN             sleep .IMP-EPEN-STEN
            ' Sit! '                   'Go ! '                      ' Sleep ! '
         d. I            av-ase!
            go.DUR.IMP sleep-H.2S.CR
            ' Go get some sleep! '
These expressions also comprise verbs, i n this case inflected for imperative mood or verb
sequences with V I inflected for imperative and V 2 for hortative moods (see 9. 1 4d above).
All the verbs have the second person singular subject suffix. Those that terminate in -0 are
uttered at a greater amplitude than most conversational exchanges are. As with the
greetings, directional verbs can be juxtaposed with the short form of the command: Vosiyo!
(vose +iyo) ' Go down! ' and Sembiyo! (sembu+iyo) 'Go across ! '
                                                               Standardised verb sequences and TCCUs          3019.2.2 STANDARDISED CLAUSE SEQUENCES
   Standardised clause sequences used in SRCs are among the productive speech formulas
that occur in Korafe. These speech formulas denote conventional activities or grammatical
notions, such as iterative aspect or conative mood. lo They are the primary focus of this
section. They have the general structure:
       C LA U SE I : (x) V I=SSIDS + C LA U SE2 : (x) V2=INFLECTED VERB
where X stands for unspecified non-verbal material and V I is expounded by a medial verb
                                                                       II
form and V 2 by an inflected verb form, either medial or final. (Constraints on the
occurrence of (x) are given below and further discussed in §9 .2.2.2.)
   These standardised clause sequences are more closely integrated than other sequences
involving medial verbs. In addition to obeying all the restrictions that apply to SRCs, such
as tense-sequencing constraints, they are constrained by grammatical and phonological
rules which apply obligatorily to them, but optionally to other sequences involving medial
verbs. These rules include:
( 1 ) the entire sequence must be negated as a unit. If only one of the events represented is
      negated, the initial verb must be changed to a final verb, and the SRC must become a
      co-ranking structure (CRS). (See §9.2.2. 1 .)
(2) The initial clause often manifests tokens of (x) before V I . Normally, nothing intervenes
    between V I and V 2 in C I and C 2 respectively. However, sometimes tokens of (x) do
    intervene between V I and V 2 in sequences encoding generic cause-effect, change of
    location or state, transfer and the inchoative aspect. Examples of exceptional cases are
    discussed in §9.2.2.2.
(3) The entire sequence must be associated with one rhythm unit and often is associated
    with one intonation contour.","[320, 321]"

2.4 FINITE VERB FORMS-FINAL VERB PARADIGMS
   The suffix sets listed in Table 2.3 and discussed in the previous section combine with
one of the two stem forms to constitute the final verb paradigms listed, explained, and
illustrated in this section. The imperfective morphemes { ere- } and { -uru} also are
components of some of the paradigms. The endocentric {ere-} is an obligatory component
of present and enduring past tense paradigms. These final verb paradigms are labelled in
terms of the tense, aspect, or mood that they encode. Korafe has five past tenses differing in
degree of remoteness from the speech-act reference point. They are: today's past, near past,
yesterday' s past, distant past and enduring past. Other final paradigms include present
tense, future tense, customary aspect, counterfactual mood, positive and negative hortative
moods, and the imperative mood, which has only second person forms.
   The final paradigms presented in this section use the suffix set marked by an asterisk (*)
in Table 2.3, encoding the indicative mood. Four paradigms are listed for each tense: two e­
verbs, se ' say' and tere 'enter' ; an i-verb, gi ' see, and a u-verb, gernbu ' write'.",[62]

8.6 CONJOINED BASES IN EXPLlCITLY EXPRESSED TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS:
       AINDA GITIDA (MO), AlNDA AMBODA (MO), AINDA JOIViDA (MO), AI TANO GHEDO
   Temporal combinations ainda gitida (mo) 'before that', ainda amboda (mo) 'after that',
ainda jokGda (mo) ' during that time ' , and ai tano ghedo 'from that point on' function as
themes expressing the framework (temporal, in this case) within which the main base holds.
The stressed syllable of the nominal head of the temporal phrase (e.g. giti, ambo, and joka)
is the peak of the final primary contour in the rhythm group they belong to.
   Sentences with adversative and conditional relationships contain dependent bases
without any clear constituent role in the dominant base. These temporal conj oining phrases,
by contrast, can be analysed as PPs which signal their temporal role relationship with the
predicate in the dominant base. Because they are part of their own rhythm group and
separated by a pause from the dominant base, they are here analysed as sentence themes
setting the temporal framework within which the predication in the dominant base holds
rather than as peripheral arguments of that predication.
266     Chapter 8   As was noted in Chapter 6, some temporal conjunctions are used in SRCS to suspend the
immediate temporal ordering that exists between the two clauses they link. 1 4 This allows
for a reversal of the clauses before and after ainda gitida ' before that'. A delayed interim in
which other non-specified events can occur is often encoded by ainda amboda 'after that' .
The conj oining phrase ainda jokada ' during that time' indicates that the event encoded in
the following clause is included within the time frame of the event encoded by the clause
preceding it. Phonologically these conjoining phrases are often grouped with the preceding
clause(s) in its (their) rhythm group, which often includes the recapitulated verb at SRC
onset. Sometimes, they are separated by pauses from the rest of the sentence and function
as a thematic segment (P2).
   When temporal conjunctions are used to link co-ranking structures, they make explicit
the temporal relationship that exists between the two bases. This does not preclude the
occurrence of other non-specified events between the two expressed events. In example
8.40, a simple clause occurs with ainda amboda ' after that' as the dependent base.
8 .40     Nu vare=da             a-ira                   ainda                  ambo=da=mo.

          , After she went to the garden, then, trading guests arrived (and are staying).'
The temporal combination ainda joktida ' during that (time)' indicates that the action
encoded by the the dominant base occurred within the temporal span of the action in the
dependent base.

           ' During that time you were working, you made a grievous error.'
  The combination ai lano ghedo 'continuing from that endpoint' is a clause terminating
with a S S medial verb form that has grammaticised into a fixed formulaic temporal
expression. It is not used in SRCs, only in CRSs.
8.42       Enda siror-usira                  ill         lano         [the-do                     oroko.

           ' From the time the earth came into being until now, nothing like that has ever
           happened. '
14      Not all conjunctions used in SRCs suspend immediate temporal ordering. The conjunction ainghae
        dabade 'straightaway' highlights the strong temporal link that ties the action encoded in the clause
        following it to the action encoded in the clause preceding it.
                                                                                              CRSs     2678.7 CONJOINED BASES REALISING CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS
   Implicational cause-effect relationships are expressed in Korafe by any of several
conjunctions. I S The unmarked order for cause-effect explanations is iconic, namely that
cause precedes effect.
   Two conj unctions encode circumstantial or enabling cause-effect: agido ' so (lit. seeing
that) ' and avo gido ' seeing that pivotal cause ' , and two express sufficient cause-effect:
aindae ' because of that' and aindae sedo ' speaking on account of that ' . General
explanation is encoded by ava sedo 'therefore (lit. saying that) ' . These conjunctions signal
hypotactic relationships when they occur in the rhythm group with the initial base and
paratactic relationships when they are separated from base 1 by a pause or a falling glide
that terminates in voicelessness.
    Korafe cause-effect and result-reason conj unctions (refer to § 8 . 8) overtly encode a
distinction between private and public information. Public information is referentially
transparent. That is, both speaker and addressee have the same knowledge, beliefs, and
viewpoint on the information and can verify it. Private information is information that only
the speaker has access to. Because it arises from the perspective and beliefs the speaker
holds on the content and context of the speech act, the speaker assumes it is not accessible
to the addressee and uses a form of se ' say' to signal that. The ss medial forms sedo or sise
are used with cause-effect conjunctions (ava sedolsise and aindae sedolsise) and the final
present tense form resira occurs in a result-reason conjunction (ai resira amo
   Final cause (purpose) and warning are conveyed by constructions using the positive and
negative hortative paradigms respectively in combination with the complementiser dae ' in
order to' . A fuller account is given in §7.2.2 and its related sub-sections.
   Although bases encoding cause normally precede bases encoding effect, dependent
bases that express explanatory cause (sufficient cause, and final cause) also may occur in
sentence-final position. Giv6n ( 1 987 : 1 82- 1 83) suggests that preposed P(presupposed)­
clauses are thematically broad in scope, anaphorically referring to a large chunk of the
preceding discourse as well as serving as a grounding device for the following assertion.
Postposed P-clauses tend to be more concrete, depending on the immediately preceding
clause for their interpretation and ""commonly referring to the motivation of the
participants"" (Giv6n 1 987: 1 82).","[285, 286, 287]"
"        It should be noted that topic-comment clauses have a topic rather than a subject, being non-verbal and
        lacking person and number-of-subject agreement marking.

    Combinations of the markers occur, as in examples 4. 1 4 with ava 'that (contrastive)' and
4. 1 5 with numo ' it definitely' .

         ' Regarding the King Parrot, it definitely is an attractive bird.'
Example 4. 1 6 comes from a text describing the King Parrot, where it follows example 4 . l 5 .
The initial topical component i s separated off phonologically from the two topic-comment
clauses that follow it and has sentential theme function.
4. 1 6   [Nun=da     tamo=mo, hHEME       [mendenihoPIC [ingago =rilcoMMENT ii

         ' Regarding its body (colouration), some are black, and near (their) necks
         (they) are red. '
   The copula ri usually signals a sentence boundary. In sentence-internal positions, the
subj ect-topic and the predicating constituent are juxtaposed without a copula, as the
following coordinated sentence indicates.
4. 1 7   Bosivara=mo mindafu, ii          nunda tamo         ingago=ri.
         porpoise=TIF big            and 3S.GEN body         black=coP.AQ
         'The porpoise is big, and its body is black.'
Non-verbal clauses dependent on and in a hypotactic relationship with another sentence
base obligatorily occur without a copula. In example 4. 1 8 , the topic-comment clause is left­
dislocated, functioning as the antecedent of ava in the following base.
4. 1 8   Nunda buroro=mo ghoghousa, ava     bu-do      tuse-do

                                                 Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences   1 15   In addition to the topic-cornment(±copula) structure and general criteria detailed in
§4. 1 . 1 , non-verbal clauses are uniquely specified by five distributional and/or
morphological restrictions. They are:
   ( 1 ) topic and comment NPs are never marked by { imi} .
   (2) comment NPs have unique forms of { va } .
   ( 3 ) comment NPs must express comparison with go, not gao
   (4) personal pronouns that are predicate nominals must host mo.
   (5) interrogative-indefinite NPs occurring as predicate nominals in comments
       obligatorily host -jo.
As examples 4. 1 9 and 4.20 illustrate, m 0 and va can mark topics of non-verbal
predications; the effector of change marker imi never does.
4. 1 9a. Seeka=da          tamo=mo fakara=ri.
         fantail.raY=GEN body=TIF hard=COP.AQ
         'The body of the fantail ray is hard. '

        Leopard.cone.bracelet=GEN work+do.DVB that=CEFF.TIF hard                       true=COP.AQ
   The examples in 4.21 illustrate the use of demonstrative + pragmatic information marker
combinations in topic-cornment clauses. In example 4.2 1 a, m o is limited to marking
demonstratives in topic position or in fragments without the copula. Examples 4.21 b and
4.2 1 c contrast the use of allomorphs of { va } that occur with demonstratives having
pragmatic focus function. In non-verbal clauses with the copula ri, {va} has the allomorphs
[vi or vo], as in evi 'this', avo 'that', ovi 'that' . In verbal clauses, its allomorphs are [via or
va], as in evia (eva), ava, and ovia (ova).
4.2 1 a. Aja,      na e =mo!       *Aja na e=mo=ri.
         Idiot I S this=TIF Idiot I S thiS=T/P=COP.AQ
         ' Idiot, I ' m here (where I ' m supposed to be). '
4.2 1 b. Na e =vi=r=ere!                 *Na e=via=r=ere.
         I S this=CT=COP=this.CR
         ' I ' m right over here! (disclosing my whereabouts as I speak)'
4.2 1 c. Na okia e=via dimb-arena.            *Na okia e =vi dimb-arena.
         I S pot this=CT dip.up-F. I S.FN
         'I will serve up this pot.'
   When the comparative postposition {go} occurs with predicate complements, its basic
form [go] obligatorily marks them. In verbal clauses, the allomorphic variant [ga] often
1 16   Chapter 4replaces [go], marking NPs that have pragmatic focus function. Example 4.23 is repeated
from 3 .88b.
4.22a. Luke =da     kau=mo mave =gQ=ri?
       Luke=GEN type=TIF who=CPAR=COP.AQ
       ' What is Luke really like? (lit. Regarding Luke's type, like who is (he)?'

       ' What was the tenor of the discussion they had? (lit. Talk like who did
       they speaking say?)'
  The personal pronoun stems must occur with the topic-focus marker mo in predicate
complement position, as in examples 4.24a and b. Objects in verbal clauses freely occur
unmarked and mo-marked.
4.24a. 1   gitofu mave vive eko             gove-tira          a=mo,    Satan

4.24b. *1      gitofu mave vive eko         gove-tira        a=mo,    Satan

       nu=ri.
       3S=TIF=COP.AQ
  In predicate complement position, the interrogative-indefinite pronouns: ave1mave 'who'
and re 'what' obligatorily occur withjo: avejolmavejo and rejo.
4.25   Susu=mo       re=jo=ri?              *Susu=mo      re=ri?
       source=TIF what=SPEC=COP.AQ            source=TIF what=COP.AQ
       ' What's the reason for that? (I want to know the specifics involved in this
       issue under discussion.)'
    The distinction between stative non-verbal and stative verbal clauses is often neutralised
when they are negated. The negative deverbal form of iri ' remain, be' obligatorily occurs.
This deverbal is followed by the copula in topic-comment clauses, as example 4.26a
illustrates. Example 4.26b is ungrammatical, because it omits irae.
4.26a. Nunda jimbi jo            ghousa beM     ir-ae=ri.
       3S.GEN tail        NEG long      true    remain-not.do=COP.AQ

                                                 Clauses, predicates, predications and sentences   1 17When stative verbal clauses such as example 4.27a are negated, the negative deverbal form
of iri 'remain, be' can be followed either by the copula (4.27b) or by a form of the verb e
'do' (4.27c), if a specific temporal span is assigned to the clause.
4.27a. Noaro=ghae         lr-lra.

1.    They may occur with more than four verbs.
2.    Both core and oblique arguments may intervene between verbs.
3.    Arguments that follow verbs cannot b e considered part o f their predicate role frame.

   Semantic criteria occasionally are used to determine the distribution of oblique
arguments in full predications. In example 4.83, the locative closest to the verb corresponds
to the ' inner' locative, that gives ""the location of a participant rather than of the event or
state as a whole"" (Andrews 1 985 :70). The initial locative is an 'outer' locative: ""the place
where something is done"".

    When two temporal arguments occur, most often they precede the clause, separated from
it by a pause in the thematic position or P2 (Dik 1 978:20-2 1 ) . As example 4.84 illustrates,
the initial temporal NP is more general than the subsequent temporal.

2.3.2 PERSON AND NUMBER OF SUBJECT
   Five persons are distinguished in Korafe finite verb forms: first, second and third person
singular, first and third person plural conflated, and second person plural. Table 2.4 shows
the five person indexes and their occurrence in some suffix sets.
      TABLE 2.4 : PERSON AND NUMBER OF SUBJECT MARKER SHOWN IN SUFFIX SETS

are: ira*li, a*lara, and areleure. From the overall pattern, i t is possible to posit that 3 S
is realised by 0 or by an underlying morpheme that triggers the mid to high vowel shifts
(e � i and 0 � u) seen in -esa (2S) � -ira (3S) and -eose (2S) � -eure (3 S). The -ra
appears to be a unit, apocopating in third person singular forms predicating content
questions and occurring terminally in third person dependent final forms for near past and
yesterday'S past tenses ?O
2.3.3 SPEECH-ACT VALUE
   The final partial in the suffix set expresses the speech-act value the speaker assigns to
the sentence. Korafe speakers use four speech-act value markers : -a, -i, -e and -0.
   The -e and -0 appear to be deictic spatio-temporal and psychological orienters, related to
the demonstratives e 'this' and 0 'that, far off. As Table 2.3 illustrates, the -e is the speech-20
     The -ra occurs in complementary distribution with -a as allomorphs of the speech-act value partial { -a} .
     The -ra occurs with third person singular independent indicative and dependent final forms; the -a with
     non-third person independent indicative non-past final forms and dependent final forms.
     The -ra could also be related to the copula ri, -ra indicating neutrality with regard to assertion and ri the
     speaker's commitment to the factuality of the marked clause.
                                                                                              Korafe verbs      39act value partial in the two hortative suffix sets. The speaker uses the -e to communicate his
or her view of the temporal proximity of the event and to request that the addressee get
involved in this activity, or conversely, that he or she should not carry it out. The -0
terminates all utterances that are called out to an addressee at some distance away from the
speaker. It is also used as the final recurrent partial in the suffix sets in os medial verb
paradigms (with the exception of third person singular forms).
    The speech-act value markers that usually occur with final verb suffix sets are {-a} and
{ -i}, z l Korafe uses both { -a} and { _i} 22 to mark indicative verbs in declarative sentences.
The { -a} marks all non-past indicative final verbs, i.e. future tense, customary aspect, and
present tense forms. It also marks all third person forms of indicative final verbs, regardless
of tense. The { -i} serves as the speech act value marker on past tense verb forms other than
the third person singular forms. From an analysis of the fixed and productive usages of the
speech act value markers { - i } and { - a} in Korafe, the following pattern can be
hypothesised. The speech-act value marker { - i } appears to register the speaker' s
                                               2
commitment to the factuality o r desirability 3 o f the ideas being expressed; the use of the
speech-act value marker { -a} does not.
     The consistent use of { -a} in a non-past tense is illustrated in 2.43a and b.
2.43a. PRESENT TENSE:
          Embavo                     re-j-irg.
          afore.mentioned.one IPF-come.DUR-PRES.3S.FN

2.43b. Na re-j-eng.
          I S IPF-come.DUR-PRES. 1 S.FN
          ' I ' m on my way.'
   I n the examples in 2 .44a and b, the use of {-a} with third person is contrasted with the
use of { -i} with first person in the distant past tense final verb forms.
2.44      D ISTANT PAST TENSE:
          a. Nu May fu-sirg.                               b.   Na May fu-senf.
                3S May come.DUR-DP.3S.FN                         I S May come.DUR-DP. 1 S.AQ
                ' He came in May.'                               'I came in May. '
21     The second person plural speech-act value marker i s -u, not i (e.g. selesi 'you (s ) said', but selevu 'you
                                                                     -
       (PL) said'). The person and number of subject markers that precede -i (-n, -s, r ) all have the feature
                                                                                          -
       [+coronal]; the 2PL marker -v does not. Stem II verb forms (introductory section ( 1 ) of this chapter) also
       manifest this alternation.
22     Korafe is atypical of Binandere languages, which manifest -G to signal indicative mood for all tenses.
       Documented languages are: Suena (Wi lson 1 974: 1 ,5-6), Zia (Wilson 1 980); B inandere (Capell
       1 969b: 1 0, 1 9), Ewage-Notu (Parrington 1 9787: 1 9) and Orokaiva (Larsen and Larsen 1 982:26,27,90). The
       -i is used to mark content questions in Suena, Zia, Binandere and Ewage-Notu.
23     Lyons ( 1 977:748-50) defmes Hare's 'neustic' as ""that part of the sentence which expresses the speaker's
       commitment to the factuality, desirability, etc. of the propositional content conveyed by the phrastic
       [propositional content of the sentence]"".
40   Chapter 2   In addition to occurring with past tense final verb forms, the { - i } is the terminal
recurrent partial on final verbs that are predicates of content questions. Even though both
examples 2 .45 and 2.46 utilise the today' s past tense paradigm, the second person singular
verb forms having indicative mood 2.45a and predicating a content question 2.45b do not
differ in form, but the corresponding third person singular forms illustrated in 2.46a and b
do differ.
2 .45a. Ni geka eveva s-etesj.
       2S talk good say-TP.2S.AQ
       , You made a good speech. '
2A5b. Ni geka rejo            s-etesi?
       2S talk what.SPEC say-TP.2S.AQ
       ' What specific topic did you discuss?'
2 .46a. Nu geka eveva s-etirf!..
       3S talk good say-TP.3S.AQ
       ' He made a good speech. '
2.46b. Nu geka rejo           s-eti?
       3S talk what.SPEC say-TP.3S.AQ
       ' What specific topic did he discuss?'
   The { -a} is used to mark all dependent final verbs. In the following examples 2.47 and
2.48 , the a. examples are sentences that terminate with an independent fmal verb. The same
lexical verb in the b. examples is a dependent final verb. In 2.47b, this verb is the predicate
of a replacive relative clause.
2.47a. Tamo+Joyago namonde-dae aroro              Jutu-mutfi·
       skin+white      I PUNC-BEN pebble give.I1-YP.3S.AQ

       that=TIF John hit.J-DS.SEQ.R.3S die.!-TP.3 S.FN
       ' That white man (that) gave us the money, John hit him, and he died.'
   In example 2 .48a, ojeni marked with the speech-act value marker { -i} terminates the
sentence. The ojena marked by { -a} is the predicate of the dependent base in 2.48b, an
adversative sentence.
2.48a. Na=mo oka gay-ari=dae              se-do            oj-enf.

        ' As for me, I came to spear fish, but why in the world did I act this way
        (fall asleep and fall in the ocean)?'
   Although the use of the speech-act value markers { -a} and {-i} is primarily fixed in
Korafe, there are some contexts where the choice of { -a} or { -i} depends upon the speaker
and the perspective he or she wishes to communicate. Hence in example 2.49a, the speaker
uses {-i} instead of the expected {-a} marker to indicate his strong desire to meet up with
the other person. His use of {-a} in 2.49b indicates that he is not really committed to a long
search.
2.49a. Na nu        y-arena,         a=va=ta      j6  tambareni.
         I S 3S.FOC go.DUR-F. I S.FN that=CT=FRUS NEG find. I-F. I S . AQ
        'I will go, but I just hope I find him. (I'll give it my best shot.)'
2.49b. Na nu       y-arena,         a=va=ta      j6                       tamb-arena.
        I S 3S.FOC go.DUR-F. I S.FN that=CT=FRUS NEG                      find.I-F . I S.FN
        ' I will go, but I doubt I ' ll find him. (The chances of finding him are very slim.
        There are just too many obstacles.)'
   In example 2.50a, the {-i} signals a proposition that the speaker believes the addressee
does not share with him, so he asserts it. In 2.50b, the {-a} signals a proposition that the
speaker assumes he and the addressee both presuppose.
2.50a. Na uju + erena,                Jamie fur-aett-
        I S want+IPF .do. PRES. I S.D Jamie come.DUR.IPF-CFAC.3S.AQ
        ' I would like Jamie to come. (But I 'll understand if the answer is no.)'
2.50b. Na uju + erena,                       Jamie fur-aetira.
        I S want+IPF.do.PRES.I S.FN          Jamie come.DUR.IPF-CFAC.3S.FN
        'I would like Jamie to come. (And you and I both know it's expected that
        Jamie be there. I won't take no for an answer.)'
    From the above examples and others arises the hypothesis expressed above, that the
speech-act value marker { -i} registers the speaker' s commitment to the factuality or
desirability of the ideas being expressed; the use of the speech-act value marker { -a} does
not. The { - a} marks presuppositions and uncompleted events that do not require the
speaker' s wholehearted commitment to their validity or desirability, because the addressee
shares them with the speaker or at least is assumed to share them, or they are not firmly
established as facts. Past events can be validated, so they are encoded in sentences that
assert them as facts, sentences terminated by a final verb marked by { -i} or by the copula
rio This hypothesis is less satisfactory as an explanation for the fixed uses of { -a} with all
third person indicative forms and { - i } with all content questions ?4 An alternative24   One might posit that content questions are marked with { -i} , because the very utterance of the content
     question signals the speaker's commitment to the actual existence of the item in question or the actual or
     projected occurrence of the event for which information is sought.
42       Chapter 2explanation is that Korafe has inherited these fixed usages from an earlier stage in its
development.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62]"

      Those that do not nasalise it are not happy with the usual 'an ' spelling, but both groups accept 'ii' as a

NPs, clauses with clauses, sentence bases with sentence bases. The second base in 8 . 1 9 is a
conjoined coordinate sentence, that is juxtaposed with and enhances the initial base. Bases
2a and 2b are conjoined by the conjunction ii.

Although the concepts conveyed in base 2a and base 2b are interchangeable, b uroro
'feathers' , which is ellipsed in base 2b, must always be in the first of the two bases.
  In 8.20, ii combines with kotugo, which is often used singly or with ii when the second
base continues the same activity or the same line of thinking as the first base.

   The medial verb form edo 'do' is used as a coordinating conjunction by Korafe speakers
to link paragraphs and sentences and occasionally clauses and NPs. The speaker uses it to
signal the importance of either the temporal order: 'and then' or the logical order: ' and in
addition to that, on top of that' . In the following example, the speaker uses edo to express
how negative the situation really was.

5.4 BONDING AND THE CLAUSAL STATUS OF svcs
   The relationship of the clause to the svc has long been a matter of debate8 among
linguists. There is no simple answer to the question. Are they lexemes, predicates, clauses,
or something more than a clause? The degree of integration or bonding between verb stems
in SVCS can be measured by several variables: ( 1 ) the distance between verbal predicates,8       West African language scholars Williamson ( 1 965), Boadi ( 1 968) and Stahlke ( 1 970) posited that
        some SVcs are derived from multisentence underlying structures, but Schachter ( 1 974:262) proposed
        that ""a verb phrase concatenation"" rather than a multisentence underlying structure is all that is
        necessary. Li and Thompson ( 1 973) saw the possibility of both multiclausal and multic1ausal SVcs in
        Mandarin. Baker's ( 1 989) object-sharing analysis, Schiller's ( 1 989) auto lexical semanticosyntactic
        analysis, and Durie's ( 1 992) fused conceptual structure (that follows lackendoffs linking theory to
        assign more than one semantic role to an N P ) are all attempts to explain a multic1ausal analysis,
        especially of those cases where ""each transitive verb in the series has its own object (Schiller
        1989:405).""
1 66      Chapter 5(2) how many and which argument referents are shared by the predicates, (3) the scope of
inflectional categories (such as negation, tense, aspect, mood) in relationship to the
sequence of verbs, (4) the lexicalisation status of the verbal sequence, and (5) phonological
criteria. On a continuum registering degree of bonding, S V S S that have undergone
phonological reduction and are lexical compounds would be at one end and non-contiguous
SVCs separated by pauses and/or conj unctions at the other end.
   Only a few conventional SVSs have fused phonologically, becoming tightly integrated
lexical compounds. These include posture + iri 'remain' combinations 5 .33a and direction
verb + motion verb sequences 5 .33b.
5 .33a.    jasa+e        +   irira               � jas+ ir-ira (fasirira)
           recline+do    +   remain-PRES.3S.F � recline.do+remain-PRES.3S .FN
           'recline'         ' she is remaining'    'she is lying down'
5.3 3b.     vose         +   a-ira             � vos+a-ira (vosaira)
            descend. !   +   gO.NDUR-TP.3S .FN � descend. HgO.NDUR-TP.3 S .FN
            ' descend'       'he went'           'he descended'
   Quite a number of conventional S V S s recur in Korafe and are utilised as standard
expressions for regularly associated events, e.g. se ningi 'discuss (lit. speak hear)' and kote
do ' forgive (lit. think leave off) ' . They can be considered compound lexemes. Mostly
combinations of two verbs, some of these compound lexemes encode semantic notions,
such as ( 1 ) postural states, (2) directional movements, (3) manner+motion, (4) perception­
communication, and (5) cultural routines. Other compound lexemes have developed a
syntactic relationship in which the final stem has become an auxiliary verb to the initial
lexical one. These convey superlative performance of an action, comprehensive-completive
events, and the conative mood. These lexically and grammatically fixed expressions having
an svc format are more fully explicated in §9. 1 .
   The prototypical svc that Lane and Pawley ( 1 992:6) posit, building on earlier work by
Bradshaw ( 1 982:28) and Crowley ( 1 987 :38, 1 990 :60-6 1 ) does not manifest any clause­
internal boundaries. Their list of characteristics includes the following points:
( 1 ) the two or more verbs that are constituents of SVCs do not contrast in their inflections,
(2) overt morphemes such as coordinators, subordinators or switch-reference markers do
    not occur,
(3) there is no intonational evidence of clause boundary,
(4) core arguments (actor and undergoer) are either identical or the undergoer of the first
    verb becomes the actor of the next,
(5) in some instances, the scope of negation and adverbs extends over the entire sequence
    of verbs.
Foley and Olson ( 1 985 :56-57) specify the nature of argument relationships in SVCS in more
detail. In nuclear layer serialisation, the sequence of verbs is joined in a complex predicate
with one set of arguments. Core layer serialisation joins verbs together that have in
common the set of oblique arguments and one of the core arguments. Their definition of the
                                                                                   SVCs     1 67clause as ""a grammatical structure consIstmg of one and only one non-composite
periphery"" encompasses SVCS joined at both nuclear and core layers.
   Non-contiguous SVCS do not qualify as prototypical SVCs, because they do occur with
coordinators, and because pauses and pause words intervene between verbal constituents.
Some of them do not meet Foley' s and Olson's criteria; they have independent peripheries.
For instance, in example 5 .34, two locations are involved. One is stated in the previous
clause as % % 'the verandas' where the addressees are situated when they get (bu) the
firebrand.
5.34   Sifo eni,          a.   avaraka bu             b.   vose

  Contiguous SVCS by and large do qualify as prototypical SVCs, some being joined at the
nuclear layer, illustrated by example 5 .35, and others at the core layer, as in example 5.36.
5.35    ... na /uka=imi            gambu fiti     do=do . . .
               I S pig=CEFF.T/F bite.!    put.I leave.I=SEQ.SS
       ' . . . a pig bit me, put (me) down and left (me) . . . '
In example 5 . 36, sirige ' launch' is transitive and has ghaka 'canoe' as its object, but
sembojighera 'they came across' is intransitive and shares its subject referent only with
sirige.
5.36   . . . ne ghaka sirige        semb+oji+gh-era . . .
            3PL canoe launch.I cross. I+come.NDUR+position-SEQ.PAST.3PL.FN
       , . . . they launched the canoe and came across . . . '
In both of the above examples, each verb contributes its ful l lexical meaning to the
construction; the intransitive combination sembojighera does not gain an object, but just is
meshed with the transitive predicate in a series of events whose borders are left indistinct. It
is possible to convert the verb stem sirige to a medial verb sirigedo, distinguishing more
clearly the temporal relationship between the transitive predicate and the intransitive
compound lexeme without changing the basic meaning of the sequence.
   Some contiguous SVCS terminate with a verb expressing an aspect. For example, the
verb dadabe ' finish' contributes a comprehensive completive meaning when it combines in
                                                                             ,
a serial construction such as mindi dadabe 'utterly consume (lit. eat finish) .
5.37a. Na bayau mindi dadabe-teni.
       IS      food     eaU finish.I-TP. I S .AQ
       ' I totally consumed the portion of food I was given. '
The Korafe cannot change the sequence to 5.37b.
1 68   Chapter 55.37b. *Na bayau mindi-do     dadabe-Ieni.
        I S food eat.I-SEQ.SS finish.l-TP . I S .AQ
The Korafe response to 5.3 7b is laughter. The closest meaning that could be assigned to it
is: I ale food and I terminated. However, animate entities die (ambu); they do not terminate
(dadabe). The lexical verb sequence is acceptable in example 5 .3 7c which contains a
different subject medial verb + verb and encodes the perfective aspect.
5 .37c. Na bayau mind-eno                    dadabe-lira.
        I S food       eat.I-SEQ.R. I S . DS finish.l-TP.3S.FN
        ' I have finished eating.'
    I n example 5.37a, the verb stem + dadabe has fused t o the point where its meaning as a
unit, 'I totally consumed my allotted portion of food' differs from the meaning of its parts,
' I eat' and ' I finish ' . However, the SVC combinations in example 5 . 3 5 and 5 . 3 6 do not
evidence this level of fusion; the meaning of the unit does not differ from the meaning of its
parts. Syntactically, the verbs in 5 . 37a belong to one clause, but in 5 .3 7c, they belong to
two clauses. The semantic difference between casting the verbs in an SVC or in an S R C
(switch-reference construction) is that the SRC makes explicit the temporal relationship
between the events encoded by the verbs. Whereas in the SVC (5.37a) the focus is on the
fact that the food portion was totally consumed, the focus in the SRC (5 .37c) is on finishing
the act of eating.
    What is the clausal status of constructions manifesting core serialisation in which each
of the verbal predicates has its own object? Do they operate as fused units like the aspectual
S V C in 5 . 3 7a? In 5 . 3 8 , the axe (010) is the object of bu ' get' , but the ellipsed object,
jambura 'dugong', is the understood object ofje basiseri 'they gashed and bored' .
5.38    ... 010 b u je           basi-serio
            axe get. I gash.! bore. Ii-DP . I PL .AQ
        , . . . we got an axe and bashed (the dugong) breaking its skin.'
Foley and Olson ( 1 985:44) cite a similar example in Barai, which is given as example 5.39.
5.39    Fu burede ije       sime abe ufu.
        3S bread DEF knife take cut
        ' He cut the bread with a knife.'
They suggest (p.44) that the use of abe 'take' in this Barai example is ""basically a valence­
increasing device; it introduces an instrumental argument into the core frame"". They posit
two role frames for the lexical entry assigned to abe : [A ,U] and [A,U,I]lvt. They note that
predicates in SVCs bond together forming a complex nucleus to which the entire set of
arguments must relate as a unit.
   It is not clear in Korafe that the use of bu 'get' in these cases is basically a valence­
increasing device, introducing an instrumental argument into the core frame. It is often
juxtaposed with transitive verbs in Korafe when the resultant combination does not involve
an instrumental reading. Examples like nu 010 bu mutira 'he got the axe and gave it', or nu
ghamana bu gira 'he got the rock and looked at it' , or nu 010 bu vegelira 'he got the axe
and sharpened it' are all possibilities.
                                                                                     SVCs    1 69   The verb bu appears to contribute its full lexical value to the SVC sequence in the same
way as its corresponding medial form budD does to the SRC medial verb sequence, which is
multiclausal and preserves separate role frames for the verbs. Instruments can be marked by
i or imi without occurring with the verb bu. And the verb bu can have as its syntactic object
an instrument marked by imi. Examples 5 .40a and b use the same lexical sequence as 5 .3 8 .
5 .40a.   . . . genembo gi-do,         goraba a=imi         ale     gae-do,

          and gets rocks and gashes and punctures (the wallabies with them) and they die . . . '
The version given in 5 .40b is a revision of 5.40a, made by a Korafe editor. It uses
customary medial forms, a shortened version of the effector of change marker i and the
verb stem bu in place of the medial form budo.
5 .40b.   . .. gi-do,       goroba=i ale       gae-do,        ii  ghamana=i bu

           ' . . . the man sees (the wallabies hopping) and he throws spears and impales them
          and gets rocks and gashes and punctures (the wallabies with them) and they die . . . '
The verb sequences used in 5 .40 represent the standard event schema the Korafe use to
describe hunting and killing wallabies. In example 5 .40a, the obj ect ghamana 'rocks' is
marked by aimi ' with that' and serves as the obj ect of the medial form, budD 'get' and the
understood instrument of je basari ' he will gash and puncture ' . The use of the fuller
marking aimi places extra focus on the instrument. In 5.40b, the use of the short form of the
effector of change marker i without a demonstrative places less emphasis on the
instrumental argument. When the instrument is unmarked and merely functions as the
object of bu 'get' , as in example 5 .38, the verb it occurs with represents an event that is
slightly more individuated and less integrated with the following events than its marked
counterpart. The verb sequence bu je basiseri 'they got, gashed, and bored' terminates
example 5 .38, but the sentence that follows it in the narrative begins with the sequence, Je
basetera, without bu. The omission of bu in the recapitulated segment suggests that it may
not be bound as tightly to je basiseri as the latter two verbs are bound to each other.
   Durie ( 1 992:48-5 1 ) also notes that some SVCs appear to allow for multiple thematic role
assignments. Like Foley and Olson, he prefers a solution using semantic notation in the
lexicon to j ust ""permitting multiple role assignments and saying nothing more"". His
solution preserves the integrity of the original role frame for the instrumental verb. He
assumes that an argument can bear different semantic roles simultaneously and employs
1 70      Chapter 5lackendoff s9 notational system to illustrate the conceptual structures available to TAKE.
Durie initially assigns TAKE (bu in Korafe) the PATIENT role it has with oto ' axe ' . He then
argues that this structure assumes an INSTRUMENTAL role in the overall configuration of the
conceptual structure of the SVC (oto bu je basiseri in Korafe). Thus, he argues for a fusion
of ""the argument structures, allowing for an integrated set of semantic roles"".
   Applying Durie's solution to Korafe would greatly increase and complicate the entries in
the lexicon. One would have to apply this instrumental analysis to quite a number of verbs,
e.g. ale 'throw' , bambu ' gather' , keve 'carve' , dighi 'tie', tendi ' lash' as well as bu 'get',
which themselves occur with many different verbs i n svcs. IO However, i f we allow that the
lexicon can be as large as the lexicographer chooses, what are the criteria determining
entries? Do we want discontinuous verb sequences to count as lexemes? The alternate
strategy Durie mentions-""permitting multiple role assignments""-seems preferable for
Korafe.
Fusion of predicate frames seems impossible in cases where Korafe non-contiguous SVCS
exhibit switches in subjects as well as the switches in objects. Switches in subject reference
that are not overtly coded by the verbal morphology may occur in: ( 1 ) cases of referential
overlap, (2) constructions expressing physiological and psychological responses, (3)
changes of temporal, spatial, and circumstantial settings, and (4) cases where distinct verbal
predicates encode perception and the perceived entity. Referential overlap is exhibited in
example (5.4 1 ). The subject shifts from na ' I ' to nangae ' we two' between vose 'I descend'
and mindorasi ' let' s us two eat, that was said! '5.41         a.   na viti                  b.     jegha=6       bu                  c.    vose       nangae
                  I S ascend.!                    pandanus=that get.I                     descend. I I DU.COM
             mind-or-asi!
             eat.I-H. I PL-that.say.II
             'I will climb up and get the pandanus fruits, climb down and let's eat them the two
             of us (repeated quotation)! '
Although no shift in subject reference i s indicated at lange ' open' in example 5 .42, the
subject Ghebu Mose is not the subject of atetira ' it dawned', sifo 'day' i s. In fact in this
change of temporal setting, the two verbal predicates do not share any argument referents.5 .42a.      Ghebu+ Mose            diti lange
             ghebu. tree+young.lady eye open.!
9         lackendoff ( 1 990) restricts role-doubling by determining which 9-role is dominant in the bound
          complex of 9-roles (the entire set available to the svc). The fused set of 9-roles for an individual verb
          (also termed its fused conceptual structure) arises from the role structures it evidences in its lexical
          entries.
10
          Schiller (J 989:4 1 5) notes that ""so many verbs can take instrumental oblique objects that it would seem
          that most transitive verbs should be treated as triadic"". He suggests freely permitting instrumental
          complements for transitive verbs and requiring lexical licensing for directional and goal complements.
          Durie ( \ 992:46) himself notes that Kalam also manifests proliferation of ""instrumental verbs"".

In example 5 .43, the girl is understood to be the subject of ere ' she arose' , but she has no
role in the event encoded by the following predicate, sandi aviri 'they grabbed and slept' (a
euphemism for having sexual relations) . She just sees it.

Such subj ect shifts mirror the apparent anomalies that the switch-reference system exhibits
and are more fully discussed in Chapter 7. These examples with their distinct sets of
arguments appear to be multiclausal like the switch-reference examples they mirror.
  Thus, Korafe data appear to ""permit multiple role assignments"" in some SVcs. These
SVCs are defined by having one or more of the following characteristics:
( 1 ) embedded clauses and quotations (examples 5 .20 and 5 .25) intervene between verb
      stems,
                                                                II
(2) pauses, pause words, and conjunctions occur,
(3) the verbal constituents themselves indicate shifts in location and temporality or have
    separate role frames that characterise peripheral or clausal junctures (Foley and Olson
    1 985 :56-57). (For Korafe examples, see examples 5 . 1 6 and 5 .34.)
   When the entire set of Korafe SVCs, both contiguous and non-contiguous is accounted
for, the continuum registering the degree of bonding of verb sequences extends from fused
lexical verb compounds to clauses and complex constructions that appear to be more than
one clause. As Lane and Pawley ( 1 992: 1 9) suggest, ""there is no natural break between
multiclause and single-clause constructions, only a continuum of types"". Most SVCs fit
Foley and Olson' s typology which extends the single-predicate clause to accommodate a
multilayered clausal approach, in which the SVc has only one role frame. However, not all
Korafe S V C S fit within these single clausal limits . Some, like the switch-reference
constructions, are joined at the peripheral layer. The deviations from prototypical SVCs that
non-contiguous serial verb constructions manifest are indicative of their ambiguous
position between monoclausal SVCS and multiclausal SRCs. They have the morphology of
SVCs, but syntactically and phonologically, they often manifest multiclausal features.","[185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191]"
