"In (290) the aspectual IDC 'already' conveyed an affirmative response. The negative
response is achieved by beh lagi? ('NO' and aspectual lagi? 'still') 'not yet'. In an

  The affirmative marker dom 'AFF' is not used to mark a positive response to a
question, generally being used to reinforce an affirmative statement. Example (292)
contains the strong affirmative toko? 'of course, don't doubt (it)', which occurs in
addition to repetition of the main clause predicate.

"In the following discussion, the negation centres around implicata.
320     10 Basic clauses   Sentence-external negation may be paraphrased as, The sentence S is not true'
(Horn 1985: 143). It denies the truth of the statement S that has been either uttered
or implied previously. It is used to REJECT S or its implicata (Horn 1985: 153).
   In Semelai, the distinction between internal and external negation is formally
marked by different morphemes, unlike English where 'not' serves both functions.
A further distinction is made on the basis of the clause type: the negator beh 'NO' is
associated primarily with verbal clauses (§10.4.2.1), and b?en ' N O T ' with
non-verbal clauses (§10.4.2.2).
   An alternative analysis here is that beh 'NO' is simply an interjection 'no', and
that interjections normally express external negation. For instance the English 'no'
and 'not' exhibit comparable patterning. However, the following examples, where
beh 'NO' functions alone without the internal negator da?, clearly show the
distinction between the two forms.

10.4.2.1 beh 'NO'
In its simplest use the metalinguistic negator b e h 'NO' expresses denial of
something stated or implied in a previous utterance, providing pragmatic contrast.
  beh 'NO' co-occurs with verbal, nominal, prepositional and existential predicates,
with the meaning 'on the contrary; but no'. It is not used in negated nominal,
prepositional or possession clauses, in which case b?en (§10.4.2.2) is used, beh
'NO' occurs primarily in four environments:
a) In verbal clauses whether affirmative (252), or internally negated with da? 'NEG'
(253).

or a prepositional phrase; or a negated (255) or non-negated existential predicate.

"10,63.2 The negative transitive imperative
The imperative negator boy 'NEG:IMP' is followed by the verb which hosts the
irrealis proclitic ma= 'IRR' (§5.5.2).
   The verb and addressee may be elided, in which case the imperative enclitics or
the particle may follow the imperative negator. The enclitics and the particle are
never used in the formation of the negative imperative when the verb is present. The
absence of the particles is not ungrammatical, but speakers judge their inclusion to
be better in a pragmatic sense.
   In (343) the verb is elided and the imperative negator is encliticised by =jia 'IMP2'
in the first instance; in the second where the verb is present, the enclitic is not used.
(343)   boy=jia!         boy               ma=yok!
        NEG:IMP=IMP2     NEG:IMP           IRR=take
        Don't! Don't take (it)!
In (344) the O follows the verb.

        NEG.IMP    IRR=hit      If
        Don't hit me!",[365]
"  The transitive negative imperative form is also used with intransitive verbs which
may take pronominal proclitics (§9.3.3.1). Consider malu? 'to be shy', whose
derived transitive means 'be shy (of s.th.)'. The use of this verb in a negative
imperative is illustrated by (347), in which directions are given by an uncle to
encourage a child to walk past someone he fears. The first verb, which is
intransitive, is in the positive imperative, the second is a negative transitive
imperative, the third is unmarked but expresses a positive transitive imperative.

Frequently, in negative transitive imperative clauses ma= 'IRR' is not used and the
clause has the form of a declarative, the addressee being coded by a verbal proclitic,
either kD= *2f or ji= ' 2 \ Note that a free vocative pronoun would not normally
occupy this position and, in fact, vocatives are rarely attested in this construction.
The construction is used when the speaker is not on familiar terms with the
addressee, but also in other instances where the motivating factor is not so clear. It is
possible to account for two instances where this construction arises.(a) The imperative mode is already established:(348)    A tiger warns a woman not to touch his fruit in the first clause. She is insistent, and
         consequently he is losing his patience by the time he uses the proclitic construction
         in the second clause.

         ""Don't pick those salacca fruits!"" ... ""No,"" (he) said, ""don't you pick (them)! (They
         are) my fruit.""","[365, 366]"
"  In the hortative construction (§10.6.2.3), used where the addressee is invited to
perform an action which the speaker is also performing, the vocative is the first
person inclusive he 4 1&2\ orhe=?en '1&2=AUG':

        HORT2    1&2       follow   YS
        Let's go follow younger sibling!
  The imperative is also distinguished from the declarative by the optional presence
of enclitic illocutionary particles - the clitics =ce? 'IMP/, =jia 'IMP2' - and the
phrase na? yandeh 4 IMP 3 \ or the negative imperative marker boy 'NEG:IMP' (312),
332     10 Basic clauses
in combination with heavier final stress of the clause and a rising clause-final
intonation pattern. The final point is important where there is no overt marking of
the imperative.
   The two enclitics occur frequently and appear to be freely interchangeable
(310M311). These are not solely imperative clitics; they also function as discourse
clitics (§13.3.1 and §13.3.3). In the positive imperative the enclitic attaches to the
verb; in the negative to the negator.

         sleep=IMP2

         CAUS-bathe=EM        YS
         Bathe (your) younger sibling!
The negator directly precedes the verb:
(312)    boy       dtoh         tet   ke!
         NEG:IMP moveilateral TO:spec there
         Don't go across there!
Any other information that the speaker wishes to include, like the O in (311), or the
PP in (312), can usually only follow the verb.
  The imperative construction is largely confined to active verbs, however stative
verbs which are controlled by the subject, like adjectives of speed, do occur in the
negative imperative:
(313)    boy        ?r>yon!
         NEG:IMP be.slow
         Don't be slow!
Usually stative verbs only appear as the complement of an active verb:
(314)    boy      bh              dkhes      ko!
         NEG:IMP moveilateral be.close 2f
         Don't come close, you! (Lit. Don't move laterally (so as) to be close, you!)10.6.2 The positive imperative
There are two types of positive imperative clause, a specific imperative construction
(§10.6.2.1) and a normal declarative clause used with imperative intonation
(§10.6.2.2). The hortative construction, which is essentially an inclusive imperative,
is a sub-type of the imperative (§10.6.2.3).
10.6.2.1 The basic type
In addition to the standard features of the imperative clause, the positive imperative
includes one of the illocutionary markers: the clitics =ce? ' I M P / , =jia 'IMP 2 \ and the
phrase na? yandeh 'IMP3\ All three markers are optional.

"10.5.1 Polar interrogatives
Polar interrogatives are those that seek an expression of affirmation or negation of
the truth of the questioned proposition. The response sought to a polar interrogative
is either an affirmation or negation of the proposition. There are no words for 'yes'
and 'no' in the interrogative context. This is achieved by means of an echo system,
i.e. the partial repetition of the predicate. A sub-type is the alternative interrogative
(Sadock and Zwicky 1985), which provides a list of constituents, or a proposition
and its negation, to which the respondent must make a choice. There are three
interrogative morphemes associated with polar interrogatives: tah ' Q \ expressing
doubt, 'who knows', 'maybe' (§10.5.1.1); kah 'ALT' expressing possible alternatives
andbeh 'NO' the external negator meaning 'or not?' (§10.5.1.2).",[353]
"
10.4 Negation
There are four basic negative operators in Semelai: the propostional negator da?
'NEG' (§10.4.1), the two metalinguistic negators beh 'NO' (10.4.2.1), b?en 'NOT'
(10.4.2.2)6 and the imperative negator boy 'NEG:IMP'. Although the negators
discussed here function in different domains, it is on account of their functional
commonality that the first three are discussed together in this section. The
imperative negator is discussed in (§10.6.3). Expressions of negative attitude are
described in §13.2.",[344]
"  The negative marker, beh 'NO' can be included in a response. In agreeing with the
negative question in (293), and the negative portion in (287) above, the external
negator beh 'NO' is used along with an internally negated clause.",[356]
"In (285), the NP does not stand in juxtaposition with another NP, but indicates that
there could be a number of things which could be in contention for burning.

"10.5.1.2 Alternative interrogatives
There are two alternative interrogative particles: kah 'ALT' is used for NPs and beh
'NO' for predicates. The former requires the expression of each constituent, whereas
the latter is elliptical, containing only the affirmative proposition and a tag.i. kah 'ALT' The scope of kah 'ALT' is limited to the constituent it follows, kah
expresses a choice of two or more possible alternatives, and is often used where two
NPs are juxtaposed in an alternative relationship, 'is it A, or is it B?' It is repeated
after each constituent, kah is a borrowing from Malay kah, a general interrogative
post-position or particle (Mintz 1994: 238).(283)    ""kulat.klbeber kah,"" khler)         ""kulat sisir      kah,     n:>?iu>??""

(§6.2.3). The construction parallels the Malay apakah (apa 'what' + kah
'interrogative particle) 'what'.(284)    sma?       khbes     kah,     mande       kah,   kloc     lyan      no??

         ?ah         'ah!'
         ?eh, ?e?    like English 'eh'   dom 'AFF' is sometimes used to provide an affirmative response to a question. It is
usually uttered in agreement or affirmation of an accompanying statement, made
either by the speaker or the addressee, as in (25) below. (See §10.5.1.3 for responses
to polar interrogatives.)
   khe? 'who knows?', is used to express a lack of interest or even annoyance
towards someone's question. It is the verb 'to know', uttered in a curt manner, with
an emphasis on the aspiration of the initial segment, and accompanied by rising
intonation.

"6.2.7     Distinctions in the ignorative class
Table 6.2 sets out the basic ontological categories and the forms used across the
range of contexts. As demonstrated, for some categories the basic
interrogative-based lexeme is multifunctional,5 and the majority of the range of
ignorative functions are expressed by a single lexical item per category, e.g. h5n
WHERE, i.e. 'where; somewhere' (§6.2.5). For others, different lexical items and
strategies are employed across the range, with the interrogative and generic noun
sharing the functional load. For example, the category of PERSON is expressed in the
following ways: by an interrogative kadeh 'who'; an indefinite pronoun sma?
(person)/ko= (3UA) 'someone'; in negative contexts, by a negative pronoun da? da?
sma? (NEG EXIST person) 'no-one', and by a free choice pronoun bororj-kadeh (any
who) 'whoever', (§6.2.4).
   The categories of PROPERTY and REASON shown in Table 6.2 share the same form,
but are distinguished by differing syntactic contexts (§6.2.2). The ontological
category of MANNER is expressed by a complex ignorative, hon-mande 'in what
manner, how', derived from a compound of the basic terms for PLACE and THING.
The shaded areas in the table indicate the lack of a form for the particular category.",[204]

  beh 'NO' may be used with a clause negated by da? 'NEG', as we have seen in the
examples above, or it can occur in relation to a clause containing a positive
assertion. The presence of the external negator does not affect the truth value of the
accompanying proposition. The fact that beh 'NO' does not negate the clause is
evidence of its external nature, and clearly illustrates that it does not overlap with
the internal negator da? 'NEG'. In the following examples beh occurs in predicates
which do not contain the negator da?, but precedes an affirmative clause, verbal
(265)-(266), or non-verbal (267), to negate or contradict that which has been stated
or implied in the previous discourse. Here, beh 'NO' has the same function as with
the negated clauses above.",[350]

"10.6.3 The negative imperative
The imperative negator is boy 'NEG:IMP' 'refrain from V (§10.4.3). The form of the
negative imperative clause is dependent on whether the verb is transitive or
intransitive. The intransitive form consists of boy 'NEG.IMP' and the verb
(§10.6.3.1). The transitive imperative is formed by the negative imperative and a
verb bearing the irrealis proclitic ma= 'IRR' (§10.6.3.2), or by a declarative clause
(§10.6.3.3). People on familiar terms use the first form; the second is used where the
addressee is non-familiar (§10.6.3.3).
  The negator is pre-verbal, but may stand alone if the verb is elided (337), but it
usually hosts either =ca? 'IMPI' or =jia *IMP2\ or is followed by na? yandeh 'IMP3':

interesting contrast to the Malay negators tidak and bukan, which apply to
descriptive rather than metalinguistic negation.
   There are similarities between the Semelai b?en and the Malay negator bukan.
Bukan is used to negate nouns and noun phrases. Bukan can be used to negate verbs
or adjectives where it relates not only to the verb or negative, but the implications
associated with the statement as well. Bukan can be used to negate prepositional

prepositional phrase. Examples of a comparative situation are found in (268)-(269).

10 Basic clausesThis chapter explores basic clauses. In the first section, §10.1, non-verbal clauses are
described. In §10.2 the irrealis constructions are discussed. The irrealis is used to
express epistemic and deontic modalities, however the category is only expressed
morphologically for transitive clauses. Before turning to the various non-declarative
clause types, the modifiers of the simple clause are described in §10.3. Sections 10.4
to 10.6 discuss negation, the interrogative clause and the imperative clause,
respectively. The markedness of relations holding between certain categories in the
grammar is evident in the imperative construction (§10.6): transitivity is
distinguished in the negative imperative, but not in the positive imperative. The
morpheme is the irrealis proclitic ma= 'iRR(ealis)' introduced in §10.2, a category
which is only expressed morphologically for transitive clauses.","[295, 296, 297]"
"  The clause containing the cause can stand alone without the consequent
expressed. In this context the consequent has already been established in the text as
indicated by the affirmative dom *AFF\ In (238) the reason has not been stated
explicitly, but the speaker makes the following inference:

"
13.2.1     Expressions of negative attitude
There are three markers of negative attitude: bah, ?ec and ?ac. They always co-
occur with negated propositions. Each is described in turn below.
  bah 'NO!' is an emphatic variation on beh 'NO' and expresses strong opposition
to, or the rejection of, the asserted proposition. It may be used by the speaker, as in
(17), or by the narrator with similar effect, as in (18).(17)     do?     ?dji,    bah,     da? da?        hal       rom                   ?aji

         Ah no! He wouldn't accept (it).
   ?ec and ?ac, both meaning 'no!', are used in conjunction with the external negator
beh 'NEG'. There are no examples in the corpus of them co-occurring with b?en
'NOT'. ?ac is a stronger protest than ?ec: ?ac is used to express disgust toward a
statement; ?ec to express mild opposition. Note the similarity of ?ec to ?es which is
used as a gentle alternative to utterances containing boy 'NEG:IMP', the imperative
negator (§10.6.3), especially when addressing a child.

        buried it as she requested. The tiger, disgusted at her lack of faith in him, protests.

10.6 Imperatives
The imperative refers to a sentence used to express a command. The imperative in
Semelai is used to offer suggestions, invitations or requests, and in the negative,
warnings. It would be misleading to characterise the imperative as either an order or
command as this would require the compliance of the addressee. The speaker
presents a proposition for the addressee to act upon. In an egalitarian-type society
like that of the Semelai the type of authority required to achieve this does not exist
between individuals at any level of social interaction, even between an adult and a
child.",[359]
"5.3.6.1 Applicative -i? 'APPL' and intransitive verbs
The suffix -i? is attested with verbs of motion and verbs of emotion, where it
functions as an applicative. The function of the morpheme is to bring into focus the
goal argument, be it a location, or the source of the emotion in the case of emotion
verbs. The action is focused toward the O, but does not imply physical impact upon
it.
    The presence of the suffix results in increased valency, and is not just a case of
valency rearrangement. Evidence that the intransitive verb functions as a transitive
verb is the cross-referencing of the postposed agent with the pronominal proclitics
(109), the potential for the verb to be marked for the irrealis ma= 4IRR' and form the
transitive negative imperative (111), both features that are usually associated with
the transitive verb.
(108)   kehn     rjren                (109)    ki=rjren-i?            kmpdn
        3S       be.angry                      3A=be.angry-APPL        wife
        He is angry.                           He is angry (at/toward) (his) wife.
The occurrence of this form in a transitive negative imperative construction confirms
the increased valence of the derived form. Compare the negative imperative of the
underived form of the verb in (110) with the transitive negative imperative form of
(111).
(110)   boy          yr>r!
        NEG:IMP      ascend
        Don't go up (there)!
(111)   Some parents warn their children from approaching the troops:
        ""boy       ma=yi>r-i?!""         khlei),   ""he      hne      khbas, de=bunuh""
        NEG:IMP     IRR=ascend-APPL QUOTE         1&2      THEN die           3plA=kill
        ""Don't go up (to them)!"" (they) warned, ""we will die,"" (they) said, ""they will kill
        (us).""
136     5 The verbL Directional raising 'APPLy The suffixation of -i? 'APPL' to intransitive verbs of
motion which take a 'directional' complement (TO.NP) (see §8.6) raises the
complement to O status. This process, which I term 'directional raising', is
schematised in Figure 5.8. Cross-linguistically, motion towards a goal is reportedly
one of the most common semantic roles of additional NPs resulting from an
applicative process (Comrie 1985: 316).
FIGURE 5.8     DIRECTIONAL RAISING APPLICATIVES
The pair of examples in (112)—(113) illustrates the process. The goal is expressed as
a prepositional phrase, shown in brackets in (112); it is expressed as the O in (113).

         (I'm) going up (to) fourth-born aunt.","[163, 164]"
"It also suffices to use the negative existential without an ignorative as in the
following example where it is not included in the response:
(32)     Q:   ""?Dh    te            hon?""        khl*n        A:    ""beh,      da?    da?""

         Q:   ""Oh, where (are you going)?"" (he) asked.        A:    ""No, nowhere.""
              (Lit. ""Oh, where to?"" (he) asked.)Finally, it should be noted that generic nouns do not function in the free-choice
category, and they tend to be found in negative contexts, see also Haspelmath (1997:
182-3).
  We will now turn to an examination of the individual types from Tables 6.2 and
6.3. The following description is organised around the basic ontological categories
outlined in the introductory section above, taking the main interrogative function as
                                                                         6.2 Ignoratives   179the starting point, and then examining the manner in which the range of indefinite
functions is expressed.
  Although the discussion of interrogative pronouns precedes the indefinite
pronouns, their function in the interrogative clause is but one of these functions, and
while it is the most basic and accessible function, it should not necessarily be
considered primary. Note that cross-linguistically, indefinite pronouns tend to be the
more marked category relative to the forms used in the interrogative function
(Haspelmath 1997: 27), see §6.2.1.2 above.","[206, 207]"
"10.2.3 Deontic modality
One of the features of the irrealis is its occurrence in clauses associated with
statements expressing deontic modality. The irrealis is used in the following four
instances:
   a) to convey negative transitive imperatives;
   b) to deny permission;
   c) to state prohibitions;
   d) to express lack of obligation.
294     10 Basic clauses   All cases involve a transitive verb embedded under a negator, either the
imperative negator boy 'NEG:IMP' (§10.2.3.1), or the declarative negator da? 'NEG'
and the modal or matrix verb (§§10.2.3.2-3).
   Negative imperatives, denials of permission and statements of obligation should
be regarded as representing advisable or precautionary actions, which if followed
will prevent an adverse consequence affecting the addressee. This act has to be
balanced against the belief that fulfilment of desire is tantamount to maintaining
good health; wanting puts a person at risk of falling ill and illness is associated with
soul loss. As a result, there is an apprehension on the speaker's part toward
preventing someone from what they intend to do, or are in fact doing, for the
speaker cannot judge the inner state of the addressee. This argument leads back to
the epistemic function of ma= 'IRR' in the earlier discussion in §10.2.2. In all four
types, the speaker attempts to move an addressee to action by imposing a condition
of obligation. It must be understood, as expressed in §10.6, that in terms of the
organisation of Semelai society the authority to command is relatively weak. A brief
introduction of each type is provided below, but the main discussion is found in
§10.6.","[321, 322]"
"(87)   A group of monkeys want to join a ship, but the captain only wants one of them:
       da?      ki=jon        [b-?ra-?rdy]
       NEG      3A=allow [MlD-lNTNS-be.many]
       He wouldn't let (them) be many.
356    11 Complex clausesThe transitive verb of non-permissive complements must be marked for the irrealis
with the proclitic ma= 'IRR'. 4 This proclitic is associated with deontic modality and
is also used to form the negative imperative of transitive clauses (§10.6). Effectively
the substitution of a non-permissive main clause by the negative imperative marker
boy 'NEG:IMP' yields a negative imperative clause. With this predicate type, mood
marking in the COMP is an obligatory structural requirement and the irrealis
proclitic is never interchangeable with the agent proclitic as it is in the Desiderative
type (§11.2.3) below.5 As a result, it is treated here as a reduced complement type,
despite the presence of the irrealis proclitic.(88)     ?ac,    da?   ki=jon         ma=tbg
         ah      NEG 3A=allow lRR=grab.hold

"10.6.3.1 The negative intransitive imperative
The negator boy 'NEGIIMP' followed by the verb, forms the negative imperative of
intransitive verbs:(339)      toy     ?yot!
         NEGrIMP return
         Don't go back!",[364]
"10.6.1 Formal features of an imperative clause
The form of the imperative depends on the transitivity of the clause: the positive
imperative has one form (§10.6.2); whilst the negative imperative has two forms,
one for intransitive clauses (§10.6.3.1) and one for transitive clauses (§10.6.3.2).
  In the imperative construction, pronominals are in the free form, indicating in the
transitive clause that they are not attached to the verb, but function as vocatives.
They occur either pre- or post-verbally (307)-(308). The pronominal representing
the addressee is the second person singular or plural, kD '2f(amiliar)\ ji *2
non-familiar' or je=?en '2=AUG\(307)   boy        swak,    ko!
        NEGHMP     walk     2f
        Don't go, you!",[359]
"  The form of the positive imperative is the same regardless of the transitivity of the
clause, unlike the negative imperative where a distinction is made (§10.2.2). This is
exemplified with an intransitive clause in (318) and a transitive clause with an O in
(319).

        ""Ah,"" (she) said, ""make a hut!""",[361]
"10.2.3.1 The negative transitive imperative
The clitic ma= 'IRR' is used to form the familiar form of the negative imperative of
the active transitive verb. The irrealis is not used when the directive is aimed at
someone with whom the speaker is not on familiar terms. A full discussion of the
imperative can be found in §10.6.3.2.
(109)    A pregnant woman, trying to satisfy her cravings, approaches a fruit-laden Salacca
         tree in the jungle. Salacca fruits are a favourite of tigers, and unbeknown to the
         woman the owner of the tree is nearby. She hears a voice:

As we saw above with mandehmoh, the ignorative is rare other than in negative or
free-choice contexts.
   When the negative indefinite meaning 'nothing' is required, the ignorative is used
in a negated existential clause. Either mande ~ mande-mande '(RDP)-what' may be
used.

"4.3.7 Interjections
Interjections are a closed class of words which may stand alone as complete
utterances (§13.2). They are generally monosyllabic forms, and include expressions
of negative attitude, delight, bewilderment or surprise, commands and vocatives.
5 The verbIn Chapter 5 the categories that are marked morphologically on the verb are
examined. Prior to discussing the functions of the morphemes, the structure of the
verbal word is examined in §5.1. We then pass to a semantic classification of verbs
in §5.2.
   In Chapter 3 the structural processes of morphology were examined. The focus in
this chapter is on the function of the derivational morphemes (§5.3 and §5.4), and
verbal clitics (§5.5).
   In §5.6 we diverge from categories marked morphologically on the verb, to a
description of modal auxiliaries, treated systematically here on the basis of semantic
category.","[132, 133]"

6.2, are distinguished by their general lack of corresponding indefinite pronoun
function, so that a correlation may be drawn between an increase in morphological
complexity corresponding to a decrease in functional range.
6.2.1.2 Ignoratives as indefinite pronouns
As revealed in Table 6.2 above, there are no lexemes which function uniquely as
indefinite pronouns in Semelai. These concepts are expressed either by: a) a
basic/simple ignorative; b) a generic-ontological-category noun functioning as an
ignorative, or c) a combination of the generic noun and a basic ignorative. The
generic nouns employed most frequently in this manner are sma? 'person' and
bDrt>rj 'thing' <— Malay barang 'things in general'.
   It is not always easy to ascertain whether the noun is actually grammaticised as an
indefinite pronoun, although when used in the indefinite pronoun function, the
generic noun never co-occurs with markers of referentiality, e.g. demonstratives, or
classifiers. In contrast, the negative indefinite pronoun may have a classifier:
178    6 Pronouns: personal, ignorative, and demonstrative(29)     me=?ikur     sma?     da?      da?
         one=CLF      person   NEG      EXIST
         There wasn't a single person. (Or: There was no-one.)
A generic noun is not used to express unspecified place or time.
   Cross-linguistically, indefinite pronouns express a range of complex semantic
distinctions (Haspelmath 1997: 3) and this appears to be borne out in many, but not
all, of the ontological categories in SemelaL Whilst the main context of indefinite
pronoun usage is to express indefiniteness, they are also used here in contexts where
they may express free choice, i.e. having a semantically non-specific referent, as
well as contexts which are characterised in terms of existence, or more usually,
non-existence, i.e. negative indefinite pronouns.
   The lack of specificity associated with the free-choice and negative-context
indefinites may be distinguished formally by the reduplication of the root, e.g.
mande-mande 'anything'.
   Free-choice pronouns actually represent free choice within a restricted domain,
where the referent must be a token of the same type, for example in (30), the token
must belong to the domain of culinary dishes.
(30)     ki=masak pay          ninca, hue, mande-mande
         3A=cook for.now food          rice   RDP-what.sort
         She cooked the food for now,rice(and) whatever.
Two free-choice pronouns take the form of a compound combining the lexeme
bDrDrj 'thing' and PLACE h5n, bDrorj-hon 'whereever', and with 'person'
borDrj-kadeh 'whoever'. bt>rt>rj is from the Malay barang 'things in general', as
noted above. The compound appears to represent a caique of an archaic form of
question words in Malay, e.g. barang apa 'whatever', barang siapa 'whoever', but
which are no longer common, at least in the standard variety of Malay (Mintz 1994:
118).
  There are no distinct negative pronoun forms, this function being achieved by
placing an ignorative in a negated existential construction:
(31)     ""?eh"" khldrj,    ""da?     da?      mande       md=ki=ca                la=bsi?""
         ah      QUOTE NEG         EXIST what.sort REL=3A=penetrate             A=metal
         ""Ah,"" (he) thought, ""there's nothing that the metal can penetrate.""","[205, 206]"
"6.2.4.2 Indefinite and negative pronoun functions
Several different forms are used to express this category in different contexts,
including kadeh, kade-kadeh, and the rare free-choice compound bDrarj-kadeh
'who-ever'.
  kadeh 'who' is used in the complements of verbs of cognition to express lack of
knowledge:
(73)    da?      ye=khe? kadeh        no?
        NEG      l=know who           this
        I don't know who this is.",[214]
"In (53) the demonstrative hosting the clitic is co-referential with the NP O of the
following imperative. The clitic appears to be to linking the independent constituent.(53)   ""dom no?=$on,"" khldij,          ""no? ct>i),              masuk      kloc     rban!""

sampay 'so' and jadi? 'happen, when'. It never occurs on a discourse connective if
it is already encliticised by =hn 'CONN'. In (55) it is enclitic to the second of the
connectives:(55)   sampay, ?le?le?=SDn,         cin,         kira?        ninca

        NEG      EXIST person
        There is noone.",[215]
"4.2.1.5 Ignoratives
Ignoratives (§6.2) are a closed class of words which express a lack of knowledge,
e.g. wh- words, and indefinite pronouns. The primary function is in the formation of
interrogative clauses (§10.5), where the following ontological categories are
expressed: person, thing, reason, manner, place, quantity and time.
   Less central notions, like 'whose', 'whither' and 'whence' are expressed by
phrasal lexemes, e.g. with the possessive preposition: do kadeh (of who) 'whose', or
with the directional te h5n (TO:unspec where) 'to where'.
100   4 Word classes  Forms like mande 'why' and h5n 'where', also function as indefinite pronouns
(§6.2.1), either alone, or in compounds, e.g. bDrprj-hon (thing-place) 'somewhere'.
Other categories are expressed by generic nouns, e.g. the generic noun for 'person'
sma? is 'anyone', and in negative existential clauses 'no-one'.","[127, 128]"
"13.3.2 Speaker conclusion =svn 'sc'
As with =cd? 'EM', it is difficult to assign a function to =son 'sc', although a
characterisation of the clitic would suggest that it is used primarily in relation to
background information, and the deduction or drawing to a conclusion in terms of
the narrator's or speaker's belief or opinion: 'due to the event or state X, I draw the
conclusion Y \ It is glossed 'sc' 'speaker conclusion' and is translated as 'evidently'
or 'naturally'.
   =sDn 'sc' was never observed in materials obtained through direct elicitation. It
occurs infrequently; in a rough count in a selection of two traditional narrative texts
from one speaker the following rates of occurrences were recorded: 13 out of 112
clauses in the first text and 1 from 130 clauses in the second. A general description
of the distribution and functions of =SDII 'SC' is set out below in §§13.3.2.1-2.
13.3.2.1 Syntactic distribution of =$on 'SC'
=st>n 'sc' is used in both realis and irrealis clauses; it is the only enclitic compatible
with the irrealis mood.
   =si>n 'sc' may be hosted by one of the following constituents of the initial
constituent in the clause, other than the discourse connectives in c) below. Possible
hosts are: a) a predicator; b) an NP; c) the discourse connectives: ?le?le? 'then' and
sampay 'so'; d) negative and affirmative lexemes, or e) the temporal clause
connective kna? 'it happened that when ...' and jadi? 'when'.
   Some examples and further comments on the hosts listed above are presented
below.
a) The enclitic only attaches to main verbs; it is never found in dependent clauses.
The verb may host the irrealis proclitic (51).
                                                                      13.3 Discourse clitics   415(49)   da?   ki=kali=si>n,          b-knlek

subject of an NVC as in (54).(52)   kira?      knon,         dom     twanptri?=st>n,

       See the child, indeed evidently the princess, (she) peeled the mango.","[442, 443]"
"10.2.2.3 The mirative
The mirative is employed in contexts resulting from direct perception, marking it as
an unanticipated observation counter to expectation or normality.
   One of the options for irrealis, cited by Chafe for the Amerindian language
Caddo, is to mark a situation as contrary to the speaker's expectation, ""a negation of
normality"" (Chafe 1995: 357) associated with an actual realised event. This is also
attested in the Albanian 'admirative' (Friedman 1986: 180). For a discussion of the
validity of mirativity as a cross-linguistically relevant category, see DeLancey
(1997); and for further evidence of its recurrence across languages, see Lazard
(1999).
                                                            10.2 Irrealis constructions   287   In Semelai, the mirative occurs in first and third person in conjunction with
predicates of visual perception and cognition and exclusively in the first person with
affective state predicates.
   The use of the mirative sense with the third person 'perceiver' contradicts the
'assertability constraint' applying elsewhere. The ability of the speaker to know if
another is surprised by what they perceive suggests that the narrator is accorded
special 'narrative authority'. All the examples of third person with perception verbs
are drawn from traditional narratives. Although this requires further investigation, it
is supported by the general use of the mirative with the third person in narrative
discourse.
i. The mirative and perception and cognition predicates This construction, irrealis
marking on a verb of perception or cognition, has the resultant meaning of observing
something counter to expectation or normality, 'to X's surprise' indicating surprise,
or even disbelief as in (84). Speaker A informs Speaker B of a death. Speaker B
provides the standard response to this type of information, indicating a lack of prior
knowledge.
(84)   A:   kdhn    k h bes
            3S      die       B:   da?        ma=?yei)
            NEG        IRR=hear
       A:   He died.
       B:   I hadn't heard.","[314, 315]"
"
12.2 The syntax of expressives
Expressives function in an adjunct-like manner, syntactically independent of the
associated constituent (whether clause or phrase), hence their treatment here rather
than in previous chapters on clausal syntax. Expressives are defined syntactically by
the following features:
  •     They only occur in relation to positive declarative clauses.4
  •     They cannot be negated, quantified, or modified. This distinguishes them
        from manner adverbials with which they could otherwise be confused.
  •     Expressives are usually, though not always, distinguished by an intonation
        break separating them from the constituent which precedes or follows. This is4
  The inadmissability of expressives in negated clauses is attested cross-linguistically in genetically
and areally unrelated languages such as the African language Chadic and the Austronesian language
Sundanese. In Korean, expressives can only occur with metalinguistic negation indicating the
inappropriate use of an expressive (Diffloth 1972: 446).
400   12 Expressives       represented in the examples by the comma and in the gloss by the
       exclamation mark.
  Expressives are never syntactically integrated, i.e. they never occur in any
position which is inside a phrase boundary. In this respect, they bear some
resemblance to the relationship between the quotative marker khtei] 'QUOTE' (§13.1)
and its accompanying direct speech. In fact, aural expressives may be followed by
      'QUOTE':(4)    ""prac,""         khl*i)     kris,     lalu?,      ""par""         khten      bsurak
       draw.weapon! QUOTE dagger            then        sound: shout! QUOTE shout
       ""prac"" went the dagger as it was drawn, then, ""paV went sounds of shouting.","[427, 428]"
"A speaker paraphrased the above response by using the restrictive negative modifier
da?...cerj 'not at all', indicating that the speaker had no prior knowledge of the
information just offered; it is new to her:
(85)   ye, da? ye=?y*r) car)
       1     NEG lA=hear at.all
       Me, I hadn't heard at all.
  The mirative occurs with the cognitive predicate khe? 'to know, understand',
expressing an inability to comprehend something:
(86)    The speaker doesn 't understand the motive behind the instructions she has received
       from her husband:
       beh,     da?     ma=khe?        pn-?ur           keh
        NO      NEG IRR=know           NMZ-direct       3
       No, to my surprise (I) don't understand his instructions.
  The perception predicates which occur with this meaning are ?yeq 'to hear' (87),
jrpk 'to look at, to observe' (88), andprati? 'to watch'. The verb ?ye 'to see',
which has a more general sense of 'to perceive visually', is not used in this
construction.
288    10 Basic clauses
(87)    The child, nicknamed bon trek (bear mischievous) 'Mischievous Bear' is, under
        normal circumstances, a chatterbox. Today, as his grandmother comments, he is
        unusually quiet. She teases him gently, knowing that his silence is due to my
        presence.

        (To my surprise), I haven't heard Mischievous Bear speak at all.","[315, 316]"
"3.3.2   Irrealisma= 'IRR'
The proclitic ma = 'IRR' occurs primarily in conjunction with transitive verbs to mark
the irrealis in a range of clause types (§10.2). It is mutually exclusive with the
pronominal proclitic, the presence of ma= 'IRR' being associated with the
suppression of the A in the clause. Unlike the proclitic, it does not coreference an
external NP: ma=V ((hn=)O).
  ma= has the same range of distribution as the pronominal proclitics, cliticising to
the initial verbal constituent of the verbal word (§5.5.2) as in the negative imperative
clause in (26).(26)    boy          ma=y:>k!
        NEG:IMP      IRR=fetch
        Don't fetch (it)!",[117]
"   Intonation interrogatives m a y also h a v e clausal a n s w e r s providing additional
information:(294)    The wife has been abandoned by her husband. The response is in the affirmative:
         Q: kmpdn       ki=ba?i?
             wife       3A=be.alone         A: ?ah , kmpen ki=ba?i               tiijal        rom    knon
            ah     wife      3A=be.alone stay               WITH   offspring
         Q: The wife (stayed) alone?
         A: The wife alone stayed with (her) child.",[356]
"The interpretation of the quotative is often coloured by accompanying interjections
such as: bah 'NO!' 'strong disagreement', ?ac 'displeasure, disgust', ?ec 'negative
surprise'; so the translation is composed of khlarj plus the interjection, e.g. hmmm ...
khldrj 'agreed' as in (5) above, and ?ac ... khlerj 'complained'. Interjections are
discussed in §13.2.
   In the same manner, the intonation of the utterance will also influence the
interpretation of the quotative marker. Interrogative intonation will be translated as
'ask, enquire', (11) below, and imperative intonation, (or indeed the actual presence
of the negative imperative marker) will also affect the translation.
   A third function of khterj is to mark non-communicative aural events, in particular
the sounds associated with aural based expressives, i.e. 'to make X noise'. In the
following examples, the expressives convey the sound of the protagonists' passage
through space:
(6)       ki=cDmpDk       hn=tilam        C?CD?         ha?    malaij    ctol.      ""p h ur""

"
6
  Propositional negation is also referred to as internal or descriptive negation; metalinguistic negation
is referred to as pragmatic or external negation. The distinction between the two forms can be seen in
the following examples from Frawley (1992: 431). The first is propositional and denies the truth of
the proposition, the second is metalinguistic and rejects the assertability of the statement:
     a) Bill didn't paint the house.
     b) Bill didn't paint the house, he slapped it all over with cheap whitewash.
7
  It is also referred to as 'sentential' or ""standard negation' (Payne 1985).
                                                                         10.4 Negation   317(227)   da? ji=sd*r?

         NEG:1MP     IRR=CAUS-WOrk         Don't get (me) worked up! (Lit. Don't make (me) work!)(b) To emphasise the importance or urgency of the addressee's compliance with the
wishes of the speaker. Examples (350)-(351) both represent life and death
situations.",[366]
"  Clauses containing the irrealis are frequently employed in the vicinity of negative
imperatives and denials of permission.",[321]
"The response is based on the clause nucleus rather than the tag (§10.5.1.3). Although
the question presents two propositions to the respondent, there is an element of bias
in interrogatives of this type, in that the interrogator appears to expect a negative
response.
(287)   Q:      ""than           beh,          kD=kde? ?""     k hlen     puyorj        ke

        A:   ""NO (I can't),"" he replied.",[355]
"4
  The exception is when the subject of the complement is the indefinite pronoun sma? 4someone,
anyone*, in which case the irrealis is not marked on the verb.

  This is the rendering of a negative imperative, a direct statement, into an indirect or reported one:
boy ma=tlDrj (NEG:IMP lRR=grab) 'Don't (you) grab (it)!' as opposed to (88). Deontic force is
maintained. A similar construction to this is the intransitive predicate da? sot (NEG permit) 'not
allowed (to)'.

PrefaceThis is a description of Semelai, an Aslian language spoken by some 4,000 people in
Peninsular Malaysia. The present book is a revision of my doctoral dissertation
submitted to the University of Melbourne in 1999. The study is based on a corpus of
data collected during an initial period of fieldwork undertaken from July 1990 to June
1991 at Tasek Bera, in the state of Pahang. Insights from recent visits in 2000-1, whilst
a postdoctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in
Leipzig, Germany, have also been included. Revisions have been completed during a
post-doctoral fellowship at the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology, La Trobe
University, Melbourne, Australia.
   First and foremost, this book represents an initial step in the documentation of a
unique and complex language, in an area which to date has been largely neglected by
linguists.
   My main consideration in writing this grammar was to provide a lucid and accessible
account of Semelai for linguists of all theoretical persuasions. The language is described
in terms of Basic Linguistic Theory. I have sought to treat equally all aspects of the
grammar, examining form and meaning and providing semantic motivations for the
various distinctions made within it. A generous number of examples and texts are
included to illustrate the discussion and to create a reference work, which will be of use
to descriptivists and typologists alike. The discussion of the grammar is contextualised
with reference to other languages and comparative notes are included where possible.
The analysis is supported by references to literature on issues of theoretical and
typological relevance.
   When I first set out to write this description, the meagre resources available only
hinted at what was to come. Each advance was - reflecting Diffloth's sentiments with
regard to writing a description of Jah Hut - 'a step in the unknown' (1976c). This book
provides a model of grammatical description for future researchers in this region. In
addition, it will benefit typologists by providing empirical data for an area under-
represented in cross-linguistic studies.
   With this book I hope to draw attention to the Aslian languages and advance our
knowledge not only of Aslian, but also of Mon-Khmer linguistics in general. Tucked
away at the end of a vast continent, Semelai and the other Aslian languages represent an
outlier of Austroasiatic, the oldest phylum present in mainland Southeast Asia. They
hold an important place for our understanding of the linguistic typology of the region
and the study of Southeast Asian prehistory.
   A few points are required on the method of data collection. The technique employed
was to work monolingually with a cross-section of the community, collecting narratives
                                                                                         Preface    xviiin a range of genres. I worked on a daily basis with normah het, who became not only
my principal informant, but also my friend. Her willingness to accept me into her
family circle and allow me to participate in their daily life consolidated my knowledge
of the Semelai language. Not only did normah provide me with language data, she also
introduced me to her wider family and encouraged them to assist me in the collection of
lexical and textual materials. Textual materials were also provided by the following
people: ?amay isa - whose prolific knowledge of traditional narratives, and passion for
relating them, despite her age and ill-health, was astounding; pa?ijah jahudi provided
traditional narratives; normah's mother k:>p, in addition to traditional narratives,
recounted events from her childhood and the Communist Emergency; the late brahim
of Kampong Jelawat, galenah, her eldest son kassim and the late nari, also had much
to offer.
   Text collection was usually undertaken in a group setting, at the suggestion of the
narrator, who felt that an interactive audience was a necessary and important component
of the performative retelling of traditional narratives. Audience interaction ranged from
interjections and non-verbal gestures, to direct comments and questions. This context of
spontaneous conversation proved useful for data collection. Direct elicitation of
language materials was kept to a minimum, employed only to clarify phenomena in the
texts, or to work through infrequent or poorly understood structures. Unless otherwise
noted, all examples in this grammar come from the collected texts. A selection of texts
is found in §14.
   The texts were transcribed and annotated primarily with the assistance of normah.
These sessions took place in the afternoons when groups of people gather on each
others' verandahs. These group settings, which included people of all ages from
different settlements, provided a forum of spontaneous and often lively debate which
greatly increased my understanding of the language. In my translation and
commentaries I have tried to capture some of the spirit of these engagements and the
culture of the Semelai.
The reader should note that examples are numbered separately within each chapter;
cross-references to examples are only made within individual chapters.
   Semelai is not a written language. The orthography used here is phonemic, and
follows Benjamin (1976b) and Diffloth (1976c) employing the standard IPA symbols
with the following exceptions: IPA / j / , / j / and / s / are replaced by / y / , / j / and / s / , and
/rrj/, /q/ and /q/ are represented as the digraphs /hm/, /hn/ and /hq.
   The initial letter of Semelai personal names and place names is not capitalised in
accordance with IPA conventions.
   The language/ethnic names of some Aslian groups are not standardised. I have
maintained the spelling found in the original document. The following variants are
noted: Besisi/Mah Meri; Jahai/Jehai; Kensiu/Kensiw; Kentaq Bong/Kintaq Bong and
Semaq Beri/Semoq Beri.
Acknowledgements
Without the acceptance of the Semelai community this work would not have been
possible. It is out of respect for them that I persisted with this research. It is impossible
to acknowledge every one who assisted in teaching me Semelai, for every exchange
provided a contribution to my knowledge of their language. I am especially indebted to
my primary informant normah het for her friendship; to her extended family, and in
particular her mother kop, for their hospitality and assistance in my endeavour; to my
neighbours at Kampong Gau and their extended families, borhan pipin, ma2nah krdor,
the late mntri? ?abas, the late nari and noriah nari. I would also like to thank 2amir
wadi for the hours he spent with me in the early days; the people at Kampong Jelawat
who always welcomed my visits; the residents of Kampong               Putat pa?gah    jahudi,
?amay isa and jimpang and layon who spent many hours enthusiastically retelling oral
narratives for my benefit, and matnor sujin, ?2on, tatey, raizan maris, rohana
2inolan, shamsuddin gosi and the late brahim. I am also indebted to Bah Tony
Williams-Hunt who generously found time to provide me with an introduction to the
community, and to 2atim padot and family for making their home available during my
initial field trip.
   This research would not have been possible without the permission of the
Government of Malaysia and the State of Pahang, to whom I am grateful. I would also
like to thank the Jabatan Hal Ehwal Orang Asli, in particular Mohd. Sayed Abdullah,
and   Puan   Munirah   Abd.   Manan,   Economic    Planning   Unit,   The   Prime   Minister’s
Department. Thanks are also due to Professor Asmah Haji Omar, Universiti Malaya,
and Professors Hood Salleh and Shamsul Amri Baharuddin, Universiti Kebangsaan
Malaysia, for their assistance and support in Malaysia.
   My principal supervisor, Nicholas Evans, first suggested the Aslian languages as an
area for research. Nick’s enthusiasm, challenging criticisms and perceptive observations
were invaluable in shaping this work, enabling me to finally find order amidst chaos.
   I have greatly appreciated the contributions of Mark Durie, Bill McGregor and Jean
Mulder, who took over supervision at various periods over the years. 1 have also
benefited from discussions with Geoffrey Benjamin, James T. Collins, Gerard Diffloth,
Ilia Peiros and Niclas Burenhult, and from the considered comments and
encouragement of my examiners, the series editors Bob Dixon and Keren Rice and the
anonymous reviewer from Cambridge University Press. I would also like to thank Sasha
Aikhenvald for her support and encouragement.
   Formatting was initially done by Erich Round, before Adam Bowles took over.
Adam’s valuable suggestions and attention to detail in preparing the manuscript are
greatly appreciated. The maps were drawn by Chandra Jayasuriya.

various stages of this project.
  To my friends and family who have provided me with moral and practical support
over the years, I am deeply grateful. Too many years and too many people have passed
by for me to thank every one, but particular thanks go to Alec Coupe, Catriona Hyslop,
Andrew Ingram and Janet Sharp for their encouragement and practical assistance in the
final stages, and to Anthony Jukes and Tonya Stebbins.

1 SemelaiSemelai is an Aslian language belonging to the Mon-Khmer division of Austroasiatic.
It is spoken by approximately 4,103 people in Peninsular Malaysia around the shores
of Tasek Bera, along the banks of the Bera, Teriang and Serting rivers in south-west
Pahang and north-west Negeri Sembilan states, and the Muar River in north-west
Johore (see Maps).1
   As with all Aslian languages, there is no written tradition, or recorded history, other
than oral based.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"
