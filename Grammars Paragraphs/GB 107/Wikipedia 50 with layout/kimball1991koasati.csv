                Stative verbs cross-reference their syntactic subjects with the
             prefixes that usually mark either the direct object or benefactive
             object (dative) of a transitive verb. Stative verbs exist as a class in
             all Muskogean languages; however, linguistic interest been focused
             on stative verbs in Chickasaw (Payne 1981, Munro and Gordon
             1982, Dahlstrom 1983) and Choctaw (Davies 1986, Jelinek 1988),
             trying to formulate a theory to fit the facts of the languages. Here
             the author will not go into theoretical detail, except to say that what
             Jelinek has to say seems to be the most appropriate approach for
             Koasati.
               Koasati    stative   verbs,   as   attested   by   their   negation,   are
             autonomous or impersonal third person forms;' their verbal nouns
             are formed as if they were active verbs of the appropriate verb
             class. Subjects of stative verbs are marked on the nouns in exactly
             the same manner as active verbs, The basic origin of stative verbs
             in Koasati is semantic; stative verbs consist of that class of verbs in
             which the syntactic subject is perceived as not having control over
             the performance of the action. Because certain actions can be
             performed either under the control of the syntactic subject or not
             under her control, verbs that refer to these actions can be inflected
             as active verbs or as stative verbs.        Thus, Koasati is a “fluid” S
             language according to the criteria of Dixon (1979). In addition the
             majority of stative verbs, which are simple intransitives, there is a
                                                                                       249

 That stative yerbs are autonomous third person forms is attested
y their negation and verbal noun formation. Compare the positive
lird person, negative third person, and verbal noun of the active
ass 1B verb cé:pan ‘to buy something,’ with the forms for the
ative 1B verb okoyé:pan ‘to be lonely,’ with first person cross-
ference.

The morphology of stative verbs seem to have arisen from a
uation in which the syntactic subject of the verb was considered
e patient of the verbal action.                When the syntactic subject was

  Since a stative yerb is autonomous (i.e., the action of the verb is
divorced from attachment to the syntactic subject), an active verb
may be transformed into a stative verb when the action takes place
                                                                 g

it present, most stative verbs can be inflected with only one of
  two scts of prefixes, and the choice of prefix set must be
‘ked   in     the   lexicon   with   the   verb,   as   the   choice   is   not
antically predictable.        Ca-stative verbs greatly outnumber am-

 Transitive Stative Verbs
      The existence of transitive stative verbs in the language, and the
 class of words that makes up these verbs, is a major indication that
 stative verbs in general are a morphological response to semantic
 pressure.    These stative verbs, which are few in number in
 comparison to the total number of stative verbs in the language, use
 the ca-set of pronoun prefixes to cross-reference the syntactic
 subject and the am-set to cross-reference the syntactic object. The
 am-set precedes the ca-set, so the order of elements is unusual (for
 Koasati): object, subject and verb.
   Three such stative verbs—bdnnan                   ‘to need,’ fyf:hon ‘to be
  unwilling     for someone      to go    away;    to treasure   someone,’   and

   All transitive stative verbs have to do with emotions for or against
something. As emotions are on the whole not under the control of
the one experiencing them, and certainly not under the control of
the one inspiring them, it is only natural that, with the concept of
the stative yerb reflecting lack of control over an action, verbs of
emotion were interpreted as statives, with stative objects.
   A number of these verbs appear as intransitive stative verbs, with
a change in meaning in some cases. These verbs are Aé:pan ‘to be
sick or hurt (see example 9 above), ilhé:sin ‘to forget,”* takean ‘to
be homesick,’ and ofahyan ‘to be ashamed,’ The transitive stative
verbs with the prefixed instrumental marker st-/s- (examples 28, 29,
and 30) have been derived historically or synchronically from other
verbs. Paired with stimaydkpan ‘to love’ is ayékpan ‘to be happy
(ca-stative),’ and beside stificcdkkin ‘to be jealous of is fiecdkkin
‘to be jealous.’ The use of the instrumental to derive transitive verbs
in Koasati is unique among Muskogean languages.

                                           Notes
     1. Unlike in Choctaw     (Davics   1986;21; 38),   in  Koasati   one   cannot   posit-a
general nepative marker, unmarked for person.          All  negative   markers   in Koasati
are portmantcau morphemes indicating both person and negatio
                                                                          n and cannot be
decomposed synchronically.
    2. A comparison of    the compuls ive  formati  on   of a stative  verb   and an active
verb supports the origin of stative subject markers in demoted
                                                                        agents, When an
active verb is made compulsive, the agent is demoted to patient,
                                                                        as in the following

When a  stative verb is made compuls ive, because the marker of the syntactic agent

                                                             examples.

    There is a rich and varied system of imperatives    in  Koasati ,
 seemingly more elaborate than any in the other        Muskog   ean
 languages.’ Although some of the categories, such as the
                                                               polite
 imperative, which is similar to that category in Mikasuk  i,   have
 parallels in the other Muskogean languages, the widespread   use   of
 delayed imperatives seems to be unique to Koasati. On the
                                                               other
 hand,   delayed    imperatives   are      (or         were)   common      among
Algonquian languag  es, and the existence of this categor y in Koasati
may reflect former contact with such languages, There are
                                                                   two
kinds of imperatives, root imperatives and h-grade imperatives.
Root Imperatives
   The various imperative suffixes require different forms of the root
or base. The first person singular imperative suffix -taka, the third
person    imperative   suffix -tika, and         the     second   person   plural
exclusive imperative suffix -6ka require the h-grade of the verb root.
The second person singular suffix -@ requires the simple
verbs.’ The first person plural imperative suffix Aska requireroot  of
                                                                s the
simple root, as do the second person plural inclusive imperative
suffixes; the latter suffixes themselves have the following
specializations:   the suffix -héli is used with verbs of class 2A, the
262
as does the suffix used to indicate the polite imperatives of
continuation, -tika. The delayed imperative suffixes -V/h ‘later on’
and -V:hah ‘much later on’ are simply suffixed to the simple
imperative form.
  All imperative suffixes must be followed by a phrase-terminal
marker. Only the polite imperative suffix -16 takes the phrase-
terminal marker V, all the others take DEL. The former elite
speech suffix -F could be used following DEL. Sce table 6.1 for a
complete table of the imperatives using f:pan ‘to eat’ as the
exemplar.

    5.   This seems to be because the h-grade of the verb is required for the
formation of all non-second person imperatives.
    6. Not all speakers accept delayed imperatives for forms other than second
person.
    7, The polite negative imperative of continuation is most often used for first
person and second person addressees. The distinction between the polite negative
imperative and the regular negative imperative is thus: one would only say ispan
‘don't cat it!’ if the person addressed were about to eat something poisonous or
inedible; if she were about to cal a pitce of food that one wished to save, cikpotik
‘please do not cat it’ would be used.

  Of the two kinds of nouns that can be derived from verbs,
verbal noun refers to an abstract or concrete nominal quality of a
verb, and the agentive noun refers to a person or an object that
performs an action or is typified by it. There are two kinds of
agentive nouns, regular agentive nouns, which are fully productive,
and nouns derived by old nominalization, which is no longer
productive.
Verbal Nouns
   A’verbal noun is a derived noun that refers to a quality of the
verb from which it is derived, such as ficcakhilkd ‘jealousy’ from
ficcakkin ‘to be jealous’ and cayahka ‘walking’ from cayéhlin ‘to
walk.’ Verbal nouns are essential to the verb paradigm, because
 they serve functions similar to the English infinitive or gerund.
    The verbal noun for verbs of all classes, except class 2A, is
 formed from the first person plural affirmative form of the verb,
 without phrase-terminal markers. The accent usually falls on the
ultimate syllable of the noun, unless the penultimate syllable is
naturally long, whereupon that syllable is accented. Thus, from the
verb hi:can ‘to see,’ where vowel length is not organic, the verbal
noun ilhica is formed; from halon ‘to hear,’ where vowel length is
organic, the noun ifha:la is formed. Frequently, as in ilha:la, the
                                                                 273
 permit the formation of two verbal nouns usually will; thus the
 nouns wilapkact ‘a plow’ and wilapkaca ‘plowing’ are derived from
 wilapli:cin ‘to plow.’
    Although the majority of verbs have verbal nouns, impersonal
verbs do not.       If a noun must be derived from such a verb, it is the
 agentive noun which is used, as in the following examples,!
        faplin               ‘to be windy’                fapli               ‘wind’
        hiplin               ‘to snow!                    hipli               ‘snow’
        malméhkan            ‘to be lightning""         malmdahka              ‘lightning’
        okhétkan            ‘to be waves of the           okhétka         waves of the
                             sca                                           sea
        6lfan               ‘to sprout""                olfa                   ‘sprout’
        éyban               ‘to rain’                  oyba               ‘rain’
        winthkan            ‘to thunder’               winihka            ‘thunder’
Certain of these agentive nouns have abberrant accentuation; rather
than     being accented      on     the     penultimate       syllable   like other
agentives, these impersonal agentives are accented as if they were
underived nouns.
  There are a few other verbs that for semantic reasons do not
form a verbal noun, most notable of which are yammin ‘to be like,’
akkémmin ‘to be so,’ (nak)sammin ‘to be how,’ mdmmin ‘to occur
by chance,’ and mayé:ban ‘to happen by good fortune.’
  The      derivation   of verbal         nouns   for verb        class 2Ai      is not
formation; still others form their ver
pattern of class 2Aii. Table 7.1 lists class 2Ai verbs and verbal
nouns, with the paradigmatic pattern for the latter.

   There is no simple negative verbal noun, To express the same
meaning a negative verbal noun would carry there are two
formations: one with the verb on which the verbal noun depends
being negated and the other a double-verb construction with the
first verb iia       the verbal noun) inflected and with the suffix
string -a@:hi-k.

verbs     that        have     reciprocal,         reflexive,      locative,      or      instrumental
prefixes may also form verbal nouns, as illustrated by the following

Use of Verbal Nouns
  Verbal nouns can be used either as simple nouns or as
complements of verbs. When used as simple nouns they take the
various case suffixes that nouns do; as complements to verbs they
are uninflected.      Therefore, the verbal nouns in examples 3 and 4
are being used as nouns, because they have respectively the
nominative case suffix -k and the accusative focus suffix -on, and not
as verbal complements, in which case they would be uninflected.

      ‘Women are afraid to look at them,’
   In constructions using the verb sobdylin in the sense of ‘to know
how to’ or mankan in the sense of ‘to teach how to,’ the verbal
noun frequently suffixes -o:/i, which may be the emphatic/copular
suffix -o plus the deductive suffix -:/i.

      ‘T will teach you how to shoot.’
In example 10 note the shifting of the object to the head of the
sentence from its expected position before the verbal noun. The
shift occurs because the phrase sammi:cit holiccé:li is a verbal
complex, and subject or object nouns cannot appear between the
members of such a complex (see chap. 20 for a further discussion
of this feature),
   The use of the verbal noun is semantically restricted, indicating
that the action of a verb is considered to be occuring a number of
times in sequence, or continuing over a broad band of time. Thus,
in example 13 the verbal noun is used because the desire not to
shave is something that is not limited to the specific moment, but

      Agentive nouns are nominalized verbs that indicate that the
is one who     does or does not perform the action of the verb. Thus,
                                                               hf-ca

  Although, as mentioned above, agentive nouns most frequently
occur without verbal suffixes, it is possible for them to have verbal
suffixes, especially in locative agentive nouns. Locative agentive
nouns are the preferred construction to express a locative relative
clause, followed by embedded questions (see chap. 20), while
locative participles are exceedingly rare.   Locative agentive nouns
are also unique in that they can be formed on non-third person
verb forms, which then cross-reference the possessor of the noun
phrase, as in the following paradigm.
ohacintihcotohofa       ‘in the place of origin of you two""

   If an agentive noun can be used to refer to non-humans as well

humans and animals, is replaced by a:‘koybéhli when referring to

Use of Agentive Nouns
    Agentive nouns and noun phrases are used just like root nouns;
                                                            following
only by their derivational origin are they distinct. In the
examples the agentive nouns are italicized.

Old Nominalization
   Old Nominalization is a long-obsolete process that was used to
derive certain agentive nouns from verbs.                  Old Nominalization
seems to have been limited to verbs in classes 2A, 3A, and their
multplicatives. The process deleted the classifying suffix of the verb
and the multiplicative suffix, if any, and generally lengthened and
accented the penultimate syllable of the remainder. The following
are the most transparent examples of Old Nominalization.
                                                                      dung""

o:lasla                   ‘istand’            ovtalla:kan            ""to lic in water’
   Old Nominalization was probably a Proto-Muskogean process, as
attested by the words for house in Creek, Mikasuki and Apalachee,
which are transparently related to the singular and dual of the
Koasati verb cokké:linjcikki:kan ‘to sit; to dwell.’
          Creek           coka         ‘house’        cokkélin      ‘to sit [sg]
          Mikasuki        ercki        ‘house’
                                                      cikki:kan     ‘to sit [du]’
          Apalachee       cik          ‘house’
                                          Notes
     1.     Paradoxically, agentive   nouns      are used   instead of verbal       nouns   for
impersonal verbs because at least some of those verbs historically are personal
verbs.    Winthka ‘thunder’ originally meant ‘the Thunderer’ and fapli ‘wind’
originally meant ‘onc of the two Winds.’ Because such verbs originally referred to
animate beings, the verbal noun, which is inherently impersonal, could not be used.
     2. However, in the name of Elephant, the agentive noun a:ti;pa does not mean
 ‘cannibal,’ as Elephant is alsvays non-human. Rather, acti:pacoba means Great-
 Onc-Who-Eats-Human-Beings,’
     3. This word has a variant, hinafololé, The element hina- is probably a reflex
 of Proto-Muskogesn *xinad ‘road; path.’            Thus the word hanafololé may have
 originally meant ‘the coiling path.""
   Participles, which are derived by suffixation from verbs, are used
exactly like noun modifiers (adjectives), They follow the nouns they
modify and take the case suffixes that the noun phrase would take.
Additionally, the noun modified by the participle may have its
subject marking stripped, just asa noun modified by an adjective
may (see chap. 18). Participles have been noted primarily in
elicited speech; in texts, similar constructions are handled by joining
sentences with switch-reference markers.           Participles seem to
subordinate the action of their own clause to the action of the main
clause; in switch-reference marking, the action of both sentences is
given equal weight.
   It seems likely that the participial suffixes are added to an already
nominalized    verb.    Certainly,   nominalization   is an extremely
powerful process, enabling verbs with overt subject marking or
verbal suffixes to become nouns (see chap. 7). This supposition is
strengthened by the fact that all the participial suffixes (with the
exception of the future participle, which is, however, transparently
derived from the present participle) also appear as article suffixes
on nouns (see chap. 13), When the article suffixes are used on
nouns, they indicate that the infomation is old information; this also
seems to be the case with the participial suffixes.
compared to the deictic ya ‘this.’ The present participial suffix
requires the focus form of the subject and object markers.

theory that the participial suffixes are nominal in origin.

  The Koasati verb, like those of other Muskogean languages, can
undergo a series of internal modifications, which are termed
internal changes, or with less justice, ablaut grades, although they
are not at all of the same nature as Indo-European ablaut forms.
In Choctaw, as reported by Nicklas (1974) and Ulrich (1988),
internal changes are used to indicate aspect, the categories of which
are generally handled by suffixes in Koasati. In Creek (Haas 1940),
internal changes are generally used to indicate tense, although
aspect is also included, and the changes occur, apparently, almost
without exception in the company of suffixes that convey additional
information. In Mikasuki (Derrick-Mescua 1980; Boynton 1982),
internal changes also indicate tense. Alabama as described by
Lupardus (1982) stood alone among the Muskogean languages in
lacking productive internal change; however, recent descriptions of
the language (Hardy and Davis 1988; Hardy and Montler 1988a;
1988b) attest to the existence and productivity of internal change
in Alabama. In Koasati, as the numerous verbal suffixes have taken
over most tense and aspect functions (see chap. 4), the system of
internal change has undergone a number of modifications that
cause it to differ in some respects from the systems of other
languages.
  Internal changes are always accompanied by an accent; in a few
cases, only accentuation may distinguish between two forms.' There
are seven productive internal changes: the indicative, the
imperfective, the aorist, the interrogative, the h-grade, the n-grade,
The Indicative
   The indicative is the most common of the internal changes. It
operates only on the verb root; if the root has a heavy syllable
(CVC) in penultimate position, the indicative accents that syllable;
if the penultimate syllable is light (CV), the indicative makes it
heavy by lengthening the vowel, then the syllable is accented, The
accent is usually the high pitch accent; however, with a very few
verbs, the accent is the low accent.” Additionally the indicative is
the only internal change that co-occurs with the vowel-deleting
phrase-terminal marker DEL or the vowel-nasalizing phirase-
terminal marker. The aorist and interrogative internal changes, by
their very nature, mark the termination of a phrase, while the h-
grade, n-grade, and intensive internal changes cannot occur as final
elements in a phrase.

   The indicative form is the usual citation form of a verb and is the
only internal change that permits extensive suffix co-occurrence
(outside of the interrogative, g.v.). A fair number of verbs undergo
penultimate syllable lengthening in the indicative; most are of
classes 1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B. The lengthening effect of the
the consonant beginning the penultimate syllable is geminated. If
the consonant beginning the penultimate syllable is word-initial or
the member of a consonant cluster, the vowel of the penultimate
syllable is is lengthened, if it is not already long.               If the syllable is
already long, then the initial consonant of the penultimate syllable
is geminated. Verbs with basic geminate or heterogenous clusters
at the boundary of the penultimate syllable lengthen the
antepenultimate syllable. Although verbs with long vowels at that
that syllable boundary occur, no examples of such verbs in the
imperfective have yet been found.               Examples of the imperfective
derivation can be found in table 9.2.

the present tense, followed by the phrase-terminal marker DEL. As
such, its use indicates that the action is taking place at the very

   Native speakers feel the limitations of the imperfective; when
discussing it they say such things as “we say it, but there’s not much
mcaning in it.” In fact, it is very difficult to elicit the imperfective
unless one catches a speaker in the act of doing something.
   A few verbs, however, are found only in imperfective form and
do permit the co-occurrence of tense/aspect suffixes. These are
verbs of location, position, and number;            most of these are listed

The Aorist
  The aorist, at present, is an uncommon form of internal change.
However, in earlier times, such as when Mary Haas did her
fieldwork, the aorist was the preferred citation form of the verb, as
corroborated by the fact that the author’s consultants over eighty
years of age consistently used the aorist in citation forms, and those
over seventy did so sporadically.”                The aorist is formed by the
accentuation of the final vowel of the verb base, which is the verb
root plus any subject cross-reference suffixes.

     The semantics of the aorist are complicated. It is often used for
the description of an idealized action that occurs in no temporally
bound context, and it is limited to verbs that describe the voluntary
acts of the subject. Furthermore, the aorist is used in statements
correcting the erroneous impressions of the listener, as in the
following two conversations.

 The Interrogative
       The interrogative transforms a statement into a question.                It is
 formed by infixing a glottal stop between the penultimate                      and
 ultimate syllables of a verb and by accenting each of the flanking
 syllables. If there is a consonant cluster between the syllables, the
 glottal stop is deleted and only the accentuation indicates the
 interrogative. This internal change can occur at the end of a string
                                                               or
 of any number of suffixes and is not limited to the verb root
 base. In addition, the interrogative seems to co-occur with the
 indicative, as shown by the presence of the indicative accentuation
 and syllable lengthening appearing when the interrogative occurs at
 the end of a suffix string. However, when the interrogative appears
 on a verb base, its accentuation takes precedence over that of the

                                                       about?""
The H-grade
  The h-grade is cognate with similar changes in Choctaw, Creek,
and Mikasuki, unlike the previous changes discussed, which are
either doubtfully cognate or non-cognate. The h-grade is formed by
infixing an A before the consonant that initiates the final syllable of
the verb root and by accenting the previous syllable. A verb in the
h-grade form can not occur phrase-finally, except in a few
abbreviations, as in example 13 below.           The h-grade, in contrast to
other Muskogean languages, is used to indicate that actions occur
in a sequence, as in the following two examples.

       ""The panther, having killed the deer, ate off of it.’
   In sequences of verbs where the h-grade is used to indicate
sequencing, the last member of the sequence takes all temporal and
aspectual affixes, while the preceding members take the infix hand
the suffix -ok, the same-subject switch-reference marker with focus.
Although the h-grade occurs most frequently in the company of the
suffix -ok, if the consequent action is understood, or previously
referred      to, the h-grade is used without it, and simply takes the
suffix -1 which is the different-subject switch-reference marker.

that initiates the ultimate syllable of a verb root, there are
interesting phonetic effects when a consonant cluster occurs in such
a position, as the /t is infixed between the members of the cluster.
If the first member     of the consonant    cluster is a stop, then the
infixation causes the consonant to geminate, although this geminate
is not as Jong as an ordinary geminate consonant. If the consonant
cluster is a geminate, in rapid speech the infixed / replaces the
initial member of the cluster, as in examples 13b and 13c. In
careful speech, however, if the cluster is composed of stops, the
initial member is audibly lengthened. If the initial member of a
cluster is h, it is lengthened by the infixation; if the cluster is / plus
a voiced consonant, an epenthetic schwa vowel is inserted between
the lengthened A and the consonant. If the initial member is a
lateral, the / is audibly pronounced and may metathesize to appear
before the lateral.   If the initial consonant is a nasal, the infixation
of the hk may cause the nasal to disappear, leaving the previous
vowel nasalized; it can appear medially, nasally released, with the
 previous vowel still being nasalized. If the consonant cluster is a
geminate nasal, the infixation can elide the the initial member of
the cluster, appear medially and nasally released, geminate the
nasal, or metathesize and appear initially with a following schwa.
If the consonant cluster begins with y, the infixed A is pronounced
with a following schwa. If the consonant cluster is a geminate b, the
h either disappears, leaving the previous vowel nasalized, or it
deletes the initial 6, which also leaves the previous vowel nasalized.
Finally, if the initial member of a cluster is a fricative, the infixed h
will either geminate the fricative or simply disappear, leaving
context to indicate the presence of the h-grade,

   There are three imperative suffixes that require the h-grade of
the root: -4aka, first person singular exhortative; -tfka,third person
singular exhortative; and -dka, second person plural exclusive
imperative. Examples of these suffixes with the h-grade are found
in      chapter        6.   In   these   cases,     the     use    of    the    h-grade   is
morphologically motivated and does not seem to carry any semantic
value. On the other hand, a second person imperative can be
formed on the h-grade of a verb root, with a semantic difference
from simple imperatives (see chap. 6).
     Finally, the h-grade has a different semantic reference when used
with noun modifiers (see chap, 18 for examples).
                                                                  n-
means ‘to keep on’ or ‘to continue,’ In the latter case, when the
grade is used in narrative, the verb in its n-grade form is repeated
three times, as in example 18 below.
   In its first semantic use, the n-grade often occurs in conjunction
with the diminutive/intensive suffix -:si-/-o-si, when the latter has
the meaning ‘totally,’ which thus complements the meaning of the
n-grade. The n-grade is preserved in nominalizations, as in example
16.

The Intensive
   The intensive is formed by both lengthening and accenting with
the high rising-falling accent the rightmost accented syllable of the
verb, taking the indicative form as the base. That is, if there is a
verbal suffix with a natural accent, the suffix, rather than the verb
root, will take the intensive change.
   If the accentual system is conceived as consisting of a number of
pitch levels, level 1 (~) being low, level 3 (unmarked) mid, level 5
(*) high, and level 7 extra-high, then the intensive accent ("") covers
levels 6-7-6. If the intensive is rhetorically extended, as it often is,
the pitch of the syllable slowly falls from level 7 until it reaches level
3. If the syllable that takes the intensive change contains a long
vowel, that vowel becomes twice as long. Note that, like the n-
grade, the intensive is preserved in nominalizations.

 Co-occurrence of Internal Changes
      The occurrence of two internal changes in the same word, other
 than the indicative with the interrogative or intensive is rare. Such
 co-occurrence is found primarily in verbs with adjectival meanings
 (see chap. 18 for examples).
Prenasalization
   Prenasalization occurred when a nasal consonant was infixed
before the consonant closing the antepenultimate syllable of the
verb. Only three roots taking this change were noted (see below);
however, each has a corresponding unprenasalized form. The
semantics of prenasalization seem to have been similar in some
respects to that of the imperfective, and some speakers conflate the
two. For example, the prenasalized form of sobéylin ‘to know [sg
subj]’ is sombdylin ‘to remember [sg subj].’ Some speakers use the
imperfective form instead, producing for the latter meaning the
form sobbéylin,

      infixing h before the closing consonant of the antepenultimate

      The last three preaspirated forms are derived by an h-inflection of
      the initial syllable of the basic form; the reason for this is not clear.
      In addition, these three forms are used properly only when
      accompanied by gestures indicating the comparison implied.
      Lengthening
         This obsolete change, like preaspiration, is dubious.           It has been
       posited to explain the occurrence of minimal pairs where the
       distinction is vowel length in the antepenultimate syllable. In only
       one example is there a semantic relationship between the
       lengthened and unlengthened forms; all the others seem to be
       semantically distinct. All examples of lengthening are given here.

    An carlicr version of this chapter was published in the proceedings of the 1983
Mid-America Linguistics Conference.
    5) An cxample:     biffi ‘he could dance’ (aorist) and bitli ‘dancer’ (agentive
noun).
    2. A few verbs with low accent in the indicative are fakAa:nin         ‘to biced,’
ibissnon ‘to have a runny nose,’ bannan ‘to want,” MAlin ‘to nod,’ and ontenmin
‘to be the same.’ Apparently the low pitch accent was once semantically motivated,
as allested by the following minimal pairs: l&can ‘to be black,’ faxcan ‘to be dirty’
and fanmin ‘to fall,’ t2anmin ‘to be lying down.’
    3. The Proto-Muskogean forms that can be postulated as ancestral to these are
*aklo (cf. Mikasuki akli), *a?ia (cf. Apalachee ahta-dli and Choctaw atta), *haklo
(cf. Choctaw hakio and Mikasuki hakdi), and *a?ya (cf. Choctaw ayya).               (The
reconstructed clement *? stands for some unknown velar or pharyngeal consonant
that produces Koasati vowel length and Choctaw gemination.)
    4. The term imperfective is taken from the work of Hardy and Montler on
Alabama (1988), which has the same morphological formation. However, the
imperfective has a wider range of meaning and much greater productivity in
Alabama than in Koasati.
   5. The history of citation forms in Koasaii is of interest. In the nineteenth-
All these interrogative suffixes contain the glottal stop and flanking accents of the
interrogative internal change, and may be bimorphemic in origin.
    7. When the subject of a verb is a possessed noun and the action of the verb
reflects back onto the possessor, a dative pronominal prefix must be used with the
verb. This construction is similarin outward form to possessor raising in Choctaw
and Chickasaw; however it differs sharply from possessor raising in these two
languages. First, the “raised"" form is basic—i.c., an action referring back to a
possessed noun must always take a prefix cross-referencing the possessor. Second,
the possessed noun never loses its possessor marking, as in Choctaw and
Chickasaw,
     8. Naksdmtmin, the base of naksé4min, is an abbreviation of the phrase
naksé@mmin 6?mi, literally meaning ‘how is it that it is?"" or ‘why?’
    9, Derived from the verb hompénin is the noun shompénka ‘toy; game,’ from
ihe verbal noun Aompanka with the instrumental prefix s-.
  In common with other Muskogean languages, Koasati has a
number of methods by which the number of the subject or object,
or the number of times an action is done, can be marked on the
verb. There are two categories of plural formation: first, change
within or of a verb root, and second, change by prefixation or
suffixation.
Formation of Plurals by Change of Verb Root
Formative Replacement
    Of the first category of plural formation, formative replacement
is the most common, even though it is linked solely to yerbs of
classes 2Ai, 2B, and 3A. The formatives, archaic in that they are no
longer freely used to form roots, are: -f-, action on a surface; -p-,
action by hand, foot, or other organ; -¢-, action involving severing;
“s-, action involving liquid; -y-, action with circular motion; -t-, action
with motion    from a    stationary position;   and   -:-, action without
motion, from a stationary position.’ Examples of these formatives
follow.

      With a very few exceptions, only verbs that have these formatives
 as the third consonant of a triliteral root can be pluralized? The
 root is also limited in that the vowel sequence within the root
 cannot be a followed by i, or o followed by i. The following
 ordered rules govern the formation of plurals by formative
 replacement,
                                     TABLE     10.1
            Rules for the Formation of Plurals by Formative Replacement
L            If the formative is vowcl length, the plural is formed by
             reducing the root to CVC,
2.           If the second vowel of the root is o and not identical to the
             first root vowel, the plural form replaces the formative
             with vowel length.
3a,          If the root has the form CiBaC (where B is cither p or b),
             the plural is formed by replacing the formative with vowel
             length.
i             If the root yowels are i followed by a, the plural is formed
              by reducing the root to CVC.
6a.           If the root is of the shape CVcVC, and the two yowels are
              identical, the plural form replaces the formative with vowel
              length.
6b.           If the root vowels are identical, the plural form reduces the
              root to CVC.

   These rules of pluralization have been extended to a number of
verbs which seem not to have had this kind of pluralization
originally. The following are examples of this kind of extension;
note that a number of them have alternative plural formations.

    There are several irregularly formed formative replacement
 plurals, the reasons for the irregularities in the larger group, the
members of which have various irregular plurals, are not clear at
 the present, so they will be listed and their irregularities noted; the
smaller group forms its plurals by adding an -f- to the root.
    Violating the rule that a plural formed by formative replacement
can be formed only on a triliteral root, there is a biliteral root which
forms its plural in this manner, srnd-p-li-n ‘to pull something taut,’
plural sna-:-li-n, Two transitive verbs have a singular form in -ka
and a plural in -li; cakda-t-ka-n ‘to chop,’ plural cak-li-n and bocd-
p-ka-n ‘to squeeze in the hand,” plural bocdé-:-lin. The verb sciti-
p-ka-n ‘to pick one’s teeth’ has the irregular plural scift-:-ka-n,
even though the verb from which it has been derived, ci#i-p-ka-n‘to
spear,’ has the regular plural form cif-ka-n. Three other verbs
form unexpected plurals: the first, fti-f-ka-n ‘to press down on
something,’ has the plural form ¢f#f-:-ka-n,      not the expected *ti#-
ka-n; the second, #iya-p-li-n (var. tikd-p-li-n) ‘to step on something,’
has the plural form fiyd-:-li-n (var. tika-:-lit), neither the expected
*tiy-li-n nor *#ik-li-n; and third, the verb limét-ka-n ‘to swallow
something,’ has the plural form fin-ka-n (from lim-ka-n, with m
becoming n before k), not the expected *limi-h-ka-n.
   Three verbs form their plurals by suffixing an -f- to the root:
okpaké;li-n ‘to float,’ plural okpaké-f-fi-n; illapéslin ‘to sew
something on,’ plural illapa-f-fi-n; and lapa:li-n ‘to hang on a
vertical surface; to have sexual intercourse from the rear,’ plural
lapa-f-fi-n. This last verb also can form a regular plural, /ép-li-n,""°
Sound Symbolism in Formative Replacement Roots
  Because the meanings for formatives listed in table 10.1 have
been identified with the sound, the formative consonants scem to
a piece cut out.
   Variation as the result of sound symbolism seems to have
occurred in the verb fiwdplin ‘to open something,’ which has the
formative -p-; its variant fiydplin replaces the meaningless medial
consonant with the formative -y- ‘action with circular motion.’ The
same process has occurred with the verb silaffin ‘to tear something,’
which only has the formative -f-; in the variant form #ildffin the
initial consonant is replaced by the formative -f- to indicate action
 involving severing. A final example is the verb tikdplin ‘to step on
something.’ The initial # may have meaning for the speaker in that
stepping on something breaks or destroys it, and the formative -p-
indicates that the action is done by foot; the variant #iydplin
replaces the medial consonant with the formative -y- so that, by
sound symbolism alone, the term can be interpreted as meaning ‘an
action involving breaking or severing, done with a circular motion
by the hand or foot.’ Other Koasati variation where consonants are
sporadically replaced with other unrelated consonants may be the
result of this or other kinds of sound symbolism.
Suppletion
  There are three kinds of plural formation by suppletion. The first
features three separate roots to express the singular, dual, and
plural; the second has one root to express the singular and dual and
another to express the plural; and the third has a singular root and
a plural root, and the dual is not distinguished from the plural. The
dual   is expressed   only   in the   root;   the subject   cross-reference
markers are the regular plural ones.

verbs that indicate a state, a punctually reduplicated form has been
taken to indicate multiple separate occurrences of a state, and thus
a plural. There are two kinds of punctual reduplication: simple
reduplication and partial reduplication with deletion. In the first,
the initial consonant of the root followed by the vowel o (and vowel
length)'* is infixed between the members of the consonant cluster
between     the       ultimate     and     penultimate     syllables    of the   root.
However,     if there is a consonant               cluster between      the first and
second syllables, and the root is vowel initial, the element -ho- is
infixed between those two consonants, as in okcdyyan ‘to be alive
[sg], plural ok,ho,cayyan. Compare the verb alétkan ‘to be full,’
plural alot,lo.,kan, where there is no initial consonant cluster.
  In punctual reduplication with deletion, the initial consonant and
o (exceptionally the initial consonant and vowel) are copied after
the deletion of a vowel-consonant syllable from the root. Although
this form of reduplication is quite rare (the examples given in the
list below are exhaustive), there are traces in the language of its
having been more common (for examples and discussion see
Kimball 1988:438-39),

 Formation of Plurals by Prefixation and Suffixation
   The second category of plural formation, prefixation and
suffixation, is by no means as common as the first category. The
prefix that marks the plural, used only with verbs that have
adjectival meanings, as in examples 2 and 4 above is ho-/-oh, the
prefix that usually indicates the distributive. For further information,
see the discussion of this prefix in chapter 4, There are two suffixes
that mark the plural, ci, and -ci,
Suffixation of -ci,
   This suffix occurs only with a handful of verbs and their
derivatives, and it is used to mark only the third person dual in
those verbs that have a suppletive plural and third person plural in
those that do not.      The handful of verbs with which is does occur
are all verbs of motion.           The following are the only verbs which
have this suffix.
                             ~Ci Marks Third Person Plural
Verb     Gloss                     Suffixed Forn        Gloss
f:lan    ‘to arrive here’          Dé:cin          “they arrive here’
&dan     ‘to arrive there’         ota:cin         ""they arrive there’
Ontin             ‘to come’     onti:cin          ‘They two come.’       ilma;kan
aticyan/at+an™    ‘to go’       atta:cin          ‘They two go.’         ama:kan
The third person dual negative of the verb ati:yan/dttan is
atki-ya:cg, derived from the otherwise unattested third person dual
positive form *ati:ya:cin.
Suffixation of -ci,
   The second kind of suffixation, -ci,, is also not especially common.
It occurs primarily on verbs of classes 2Aii and 3A, and is used to
indicate that the action of the verb is repeated or extended.
    In its simplest form, the suffix merely causes the verbal accent to
fall on the syllable immediately preceding the suffix, as in the
following verbs.

wananatlin       ‘to shiver’         wananatli:cin         ‘to shiver all over’
pattin           ‘to split up        patticcin             ‘to splinter something’
                  something’
talkan           ‘to be lying        talka:cin             ‘to be lying all over

                                                            [of a flood)’

                                                      {of a river bank}’
   When suffixed to a verb terminating in the class suffix -ka, -ci,
often converts -ka to -li in the same fashion as the homophonous
compulsive.

tatabanép-ka-n     = ‘to jump over’       tatabanap-li-ci-n    ‘to overflow’
  However, in four cases, -ci, converts -li to -ka, apparently to
prevent homophony with the compulsives of these same verbs.

                                        Notes
   This chapter, in preliminary form, was published in the proceedings of the 1982
Mid-America Linguistics Conference.
    1. The author had previously considered the yowel length formative to be
simply the induced vowel length of the indicative appearing when the peaultimate
syllable of the verb was open. However, careful hearing of the compulsive forms
of such verbs has shown that the vowel length is still present and thus consists of
an independent segment, parallel to the other formatives. As a gencral rule,
plurality in intransitive verbs refers to the subject, in transitive verbs to the object.
With verbs indicating a punctual action, plurality usually refers to the number of
times the action is done.
    2. Hardy and Moniler (1988a:405), based on a reading of Kimball (1982)
concluded that the “semantic connections [of the formatives] are quite vague.” It
is necessary to sce a number of examples of verbs having the same formative
together (more than the sample four of cach category given in the text) to see that
there is indeed a semantic connection. A good example is the formative -p-, action
by hand, foot, or other organ, found in the following verbs:
          ficd-p-lin           ‘to raise one's head while lying on one's:‘stomach'
          fict-p-kan           ‘to gore’
          foté-p-kan           ‘to pull up""
          hissaklaw4-p-kan     ‘to pull someone's hair up by the roots’
          kahd-p-lin           ‘to dip up’
         kayé-p-kan            ‘to pick up a granular substance’
         kohé-p-kan            ‘to knuckle someone’
         las4-p-lin            ‘to lick something’
         lofa-p-lin            ‘to take a lengthwise chip off something’
         tiyd-p-lin            “to step on’
         tomé-p-lin           ‘to whip’
         misi-p-lin           ‘to wink""
         stah4-p-kan          ‘to lean on one’s elbows""
         tiwd-p-lin           ‘to open’
         yité-p-lin           ‘to {car down’
   3..   In the following lists, the formative will be separated from the rest of the
root by hyphens. Although historically it was a scparate morpheme, it can not be
80 considcred at present, The -n that follows a cited verb is the switch-reference
Suffix. Although verbs with -n are glossed as infinitives, they are actually third
person forms, The equivalent of English infinitives, the verbal nouns, are derived
reappears when it becomes part of a consonant cluster.
    8. The forms of this verb are no longer understood as being singular or plural.
Some people use obekhitiplin for both singular and plural; others use obakhitlin.
This verb contains the element obak-, an archaic form of the noun obéli ‘back;
behind’; both terms arc ultimately derived from Proto-Muskogean *ok”a7tixa.
    9, This verb contains fyyak-, an archaic form of iyyi ‘foot,’ which is also found
in the verb iyyakhalatkan.   ‘to catch one’s foot and trip.’ Both forms descend from
Proto-Muskogean *ilya?i ‘foot’; Apalachee ipa, Creck ili.
   10,    The above description is the synchronic situation concerning the
pluralization of verbs with formatives. The diachronic situation is complicated by
the fact that the plural formsscem to be basic and that the singulars were derived,
This fact is attested first by the number of verbs that occur only in “plural” form
and that refer to actions consistingof a number of separate motions that inherently
cannot be done once—for example: bftin ‘to dance,’ hiplin ‘to snow,’ {alin “to
play the ball game,"" saslin to masturbate,’ ete, Second, this fact is attested by
several roots that have forms with more than one formative—for example: kalé-
s-li-n ‘to scratch,’ kalé-f-fi-n ‘to mark,’ ataka-:-ka-n “to be hanging,’ ataka-p-ka-n
‘to be hung up on something like thorns or briars,’ and (ané-t-li-n ‘to descend,’
tanéy-li-n ‘to roll something with a downward motion.
    11. This-verb is falling out of use at the present, perhaps because attrition of the
dual is beginning in Koasati, a process already far advanced in Alabama (Lupardus
1982:147-48, 152-55). However, with other verbs of position and verbs of motion,
the dual is used consistently,
   The verb ballé:kan ‘to lic down {sg],’ which has a regular plural, bd/kan, has a
dual formed by s-infixation, ballaskan.
   12, The plurality marked on these verbs, as in many transitive verbs with plural
marking, is the number of the object.
   13. The plurality marked on these verbs is the number of times the action is
done,
   14. Like onohali:kan are achali;kan/askahkan ‘to exit’ and cokhatizkan/
cokkahkan ‘to enter.’
   15. In Alabama, in addition to walizkan           there is the regular verb pair
tosttocka ftortka.
   16, The verbal nouns of these three verbs have meanings additional to their
verbal ones. Ali:ta-also means ‘life history,’ aliswa means ‘a dwelling place of two
people,’ and isti/kaé means ‘a place of many dwelling or existing.’
   17. This verbal noun also has the additional meaning ‘personality; someone's
personal thoughts and feclings.’
. =     Here, vowel length is induced by the indicative internal change and is not
inherent.
  22. This is an am-stative verb, therefore it must have a subject cross-reference
marker to be spoken intelligibly. The third person form is chosen to parallel the
other examples given.
  23,      In the first, second, and third persons singular, afijwn and d#an have
subtle semantic differences. Avizyan indicates that one is actually in the process
of going, while Gan indicates that one is considering or planning to go.
  24, The dual of the verb ‘to sit,’ cikki:kan, forms ciki:kézci-n ‘to sil agitatedly
[du}.’ The plural is irregular: Isat &ya-n ‘to sit agitatedly [pl].” This form seems
(o have arisen to avoid confusion with the compulsive isé:cin ‘to scat several
people.’
  25. The plural verb sobayézlin ‘to know’ is used only in the third person plural.
For the first and second person plural Sobaylin is used.
  There are at least nine methods by which verbs may be derived
from nouns or other verbs: derivation through root transformation,
verbalization with -o-, verbalization with -/i, verbalization with -ci,
derivation   by n-grade   and   -:si suffixation, derivation   through
classifying suffix transformation,   compounding,     borrowing,   and
reduplication.
Derivation through Root Transformation
   This process takes a noun root and treats it as a verb root by
applying the obligatory internal changes typical of verbs.
Transformation of a noun into a verb by the application of the
indicative internal change is most common. Verbs so derived have
the meaning of being, becoming, producing, or acting as the noun
of origin, as in the following examples.
                                                                    335
                                icokhiskon      ‘to grow a beard’
                                mihan           ‘to be fat""
                                ocksin          ‘to have children’
onapi                           ond:pin         ‘to get pregnant’
totkaybi                        totkéybin       *to turn to coals’
   Several verbs derived through root transformation occur only with
the verbal prefix iva- ‘action on the ground’ and are used to
described kinds of ground. The following is a representative list.

Verbalization with -o-
     The emphatic/copular suffix -o-, which is of class 3Cii, is
frequently employed when the identity of one noun with another is
asserted or denied, as in the following examples.
2) {Gesi-k sayk-6-Y
      BIRD-subj VULTURE-be-phr-term
      / {&sik sayk6 /
       ‘The bird is a vulture (not anything else),’
3)     nashollé-k c4-I-ko-Y
       WILD:ANIMAL-subj          Isstats-BE:A-3neg(2A)-phriterm
       ca-ai:t-o-Y
       1sstats-HUMAN:BEING-be-phriterm
       / nashollék calkg. acaztg /
       ‘Lam not a wild animal. Iam a human being!’
       BIRD VULTURE
       / {&si sayki /
       “The bird's 2 vulture.’
4c)    sayki-k {&s-on énk
       VULTURE-subj BIRD-obj:foc BE(intrans)
       / saykik f6son 6nk /
       ‘The vulture is a bird.""
  The suffix -o- can be added as well to verbs. In such cases it has
no copular meaning, but is merely emphatic. Examples 235 and
236 in chapter 4 show the use of this suffix in a purely structural
manner to permit the negation of the irrealis suffix -laho-. The
following examples show the use of this suffix with verbs.
5)    cokfi-k ilakas4:mo-y4;1-0-Y
      RABBIT-subj SUFFER:HUBRIS-modal-be-phr:term
      / cokfik ilakasézmoy4:lo /
      “Indeed, Rabbit occasionally suffers from hubris,""
6)    mé:mi-n hissi ho-koy6ffi-toho-k 6nk-o-Y
      BE;THEN-sw HAIR distr-CUT(sg)-realis-ss BE(intrans)-be-phr:tcrm

     / fslalahokkéhe katik 6S /
     ‘But it is the case that he will not be able to arrive here.”
  With the verb ‘to be,’ dmmin, -o- forms a complex, that, rather
than asserting that whatever the complex governs is true, merely
suggests it to be so. This complex can be rendered in English by

     occur by the physical             actions of another, with a very limited
     metaphorical extention. Thus, ci can be used to derive nokcobd:cin
     ‘to stop someone’ from nokco:ban ‘to stop,’ but it cannot derive a
     compulsive from péftin ‘to split something.’ In the latter case, if
     one wants to express a causative, the independent verb /éhnon ‘to
     cause’ is linked to the verb, as in téhnon péttin ‘to cause someone
     to split something.’
        The compulsive is a root-forming suffix; that is, a word derived
     with -ci is considered a single root, and all internal changes take
     place according to the shape of the new root (see chap. 9).                    When
     ~ci is suffixed to verbs of class 3A ending in -ka, the -ka is changed
     to -fi. This operation is purely formal and does not give additional
     semantic weight. The newly derived verb then belongs to class 2B.
     A few examples are given below, followed by the inflection of
     yahit:cin ‘to cause to cry,’ derived from yahkan ‘to cry.’

    If a verb of class 3A that terminates in one of the classifying
suffixes -ko or -ki has -ci suffixed to it, the classifying suffix does not
change, and the verb is transformed to one of class 3B, as in the
following examples.

homophonous morpheme -ci, a suffix indicating that an action is
taking place a number of times, is discussed in chapter 10.
Derivation by n-grade and -:si- suffixation
   This form of derivation is not very productive, with only a handful
of forms noted. The meanings of verbs derived in this way contain
intense or continued physical activity. The derivation consists of the
n-prade of a verb followed by the intensive/diminutive suffix -o:s/,
which fuses to the verb root. If the verb to which this derivation is
applied is of class 1A or 2C, the derived verb remains 1A or 2C.

   Occasionally a verb in -fi and a verb in -ka are clearly related;
however, the semantics of one or the other verb are so specialized
that it is not possible to determine which verb is primary in origin.

Compounding
   Compounding of two words to form a verb is extremely rare, but
six examples have been noted:          jipacé:ban ‘to be a heavy eater,’
from {pan ‘to eat’ and cé:ban ‘to be big’; and five verbs in which
the second part of the compound is made up of the element “Ibi
‘face,’ no longer used as an independent noun, but only as a verbal
prefix. These are: hatké:bin ‘to turn pale-faced from fright,’ from
hatkan ‘to be white’; pasa:ka:bi:kan{pasaska:bi:kan ‘to be ugly-
faced {sg/pl],’ from pasd:kan/pasaskan, ‘to be ugly [sg/pl]’; and
stipila:bi:kan/ stipisla:bi:kan ‘to have an attractive face [sg/pl]’ from
stipi:lan/ stipistan ‘to be physically attractive [sg/pl].’
   Occasionally the adverbial suffix -fhna-‘too much’ will fuse with
a preceding word to form a root, as is illustrated by comparison of
the following two sentences.
15a)   i:pa-li-fihna-t
       EAT-Iss-adv-Past
       f izpalifihnat /
       ‘T ate too much.’
15b)    ipafihna-li-t

       / ipafitnalit /
       ‘Toverate,’
           / bataplilazho:sit/
           ‘T hit it very hard (not necessarily intending to).’
 168) batapla:ho:si-li-t
      HIT-ADV-1ss-Past
           / batapla:hossilit /
           ‘I hit it very hard (and intended to do'so),’
    Although this construction is so rare that its derivational effects
 are unclear, it seems likely that it affects the class membership of
 the derived verb in the same manner as the n-grade -:si derivation.
Borrowing
   As a method of verb formation borrowing is not especially
common. Borrowing has taken place from other Indian languages,
from French, and from English. This section includes only verbs
that have Koasati equivalents; verbs such as andzhin ‘to be poorly
dressed,’ from Creek anahita ‘to be in want’ or ficcdkkin ‘to be
jealous,’ from Creek fikcakhita, which have no other equivalents
and are not perceived as being loans, will not be listed.’

The Incorporative Suffixes -ka and -li:ci
   Most recent loans from English are taken into the language by
the incorporative suffix -ka. Because most English verb roots are
monosyllabic and terminate with a consonant, they are not able to
be assimilated into Koasati syllable structure unchanged. To make
the syllable structure of an English word compatible with that of a
Koasati word, the element -ka is added to the English word, which
then not only makes the syllable structure congenial, but also allows
the verb to be inflected as one of class 3A.               Nevertheless, the use
of English verbs is considered to be sloppy speaking and is
stigmatized to some degree, Because, technically, any English verb
can be used in a Koasati sentence by means of -ka, and no English
verb is used to the exclusion of any Koasati verb, a listing of
examples cannot be made.                The example below shows the use of
the suffix -ka on an English verb followed by the proper Koasati
equivalent.
                      ed sugar for me.’
   The two eldest male speakers consulted were, surprisingly, the
Ones who used the most English loan verbs, such as vétkar ‘the
voted’ for ittabanni:cit and bé:nkalit ‘I was born’ for cahofantit.
Only school-age children, talking about unfamiliar subjects, used
more    English   loans.       Compulsives     of verbs   formed   by -ka
occasionally occur; thus from kdankan ‘to be canned [of food]’ is
formed kankéd:cin ‘to can food.’
   A very few verbs are derived from English words by means of the
suffix -/f:ci. On the surface, -/f:ci would seem to be the compulsive
of -ka, were it not for the fact that the compulsive of -ka is -ké:ci.
These are verbs used only by children and teenagers; so this
method may be a new incorporative structure. The verbs noted are
matonit:cin “to turn something on,’ from English on and matofli:cin
‘to turn something off,’ from English off.
Reduplication
  Although verbs with iterative meaning are generally formed by
the prefixation of hoho-/ohoh-            (the reduplicated form of the
distributive prefix ho-/oh-;    see chap. 4), a small number of verbs
derive a new root with either a punctual or an iterative meaning by
means of reduplication.    Koasati reduplication has been discussed
extensively by Kimball (1988), whose comments will only be
recapitulated here.
  There are two forms of reduplication, punctual and iterative.

    Iterative reduplication copies the consonant and vowel of the
penultimate syllable and infixes it after the penultimate syllable of
the verb of origin, as illustrated below,

                                        Notes
     1, Even though the realis is used, the sentence is not translated in the past
tense, as this is an cxample of the genre of aphorism, which describes an idealized
sequence of events. The realis is frequently used in this genre; however, it is best
rendered in English with a gnomic present.
    2. This word originally applied only to the bioluminescence observed in glowing
insects such as fireflics and millipedes, Natural light is referred to by the verb
hastéhkin “to be light [of the sun or moon].
    3, Because of the locative ya:li *here,' the demonstrative y@ ‘this’ is considered
superfluous and is not used.
    4. Note that illi:cin ‘to allow to die by abusc or neglect’ is not synonymous with
f:bin “to kill.’ Although the result in both cases is death, the intention
                                                                           differs.
    5.   The gemination of ¢ in kapatiizcin scems to have been motivated by a
parallel to other verbs in which geminate ¢ is the result of a # cluster, Unlike
other nouns verbalized with -ci, kapatfi:cin is a member of class 2B,
    6. A semantically equivalent form produced by root transformation is also
found, fakhimin ‘to bleed.’
    7. It is somewhat doubtful whether all these words are really perceived as
loans. Those that clearly are, such as sirmandélin, baptin, and-efitkan, are looked
on with such disfavor that they have become obsolete, Even skilkan, which has
been long naturalized, suffers severe competition from nazsincaksobdaylin. This
linguistic behavior is all the more interesting in that speakers have no qualms about
taking whole English phrases into Koasati by means of the incorporative suffix ka.
   8.    This Creek form is from Loughridge and Hodge (1890); in the modern
Creek language the final vowel of the word has been lost.
   9. The use of English loans by these elderly male speakers may have been
sociolinguisticallbased.
                      y ‘These men were (clling things that they thought were
important to a semispcaker (the author), whom they wished fo understand fully
what they were saying.
inside a building,’ timimihkécin   ‘to make a squelching sound, as of stepping in
mud,’ and Jopopohké:cin   ‘to make a Mapping sound,’ related to the interjection
fopopép “flap, flap!""
   Koasati has a regular decimal numeral system and a number of
elaborate ways of using it. However, because of extreme pressure
from English, the youngest speakers cannot manipulate the system
to any great degree and borrow English words into their Koasati
when using numerals, Only the oldest speakers are comfortable in
the system, and it is their usage that is recorded here.        The
following discussion will cover cardinal, ordinal, and adverbial
numerals, discuss the transitivization of numerals and the use of
these transitivized forms to tell time, show how the Koasati counted
the months and days and how they used to discuss mathematics,
and illustrate the old system for counting money.
Cardinal Numerals
  One of the salient features of numerals is that they are verbs,
with the exception of the terms cokpf ‘hundred’ and cokpacé:ba
‘thousand,’ which are nouns and require a following verbal numeral.
Unlike most verbs, numerals do not form a verbal noun.        In
counting, numerals require the switch-reference suffix -n to be
affixed.

            osté:kan
            cahappa:kan

    Because numerals are verbs, their syntax is very different in
 Koasati than in English. If a numeral is not the main verb of the
sentence, it must be related to that verb—with the connective suffix
-t if it shares the same subject with that verb, or with the switch-
reference suffix -n if the subjects are different. A noun governed
by a numeral is actually the subject of the verbal phrase including
the numeral. If the numeral phrase shares the subject with a
following verb, the noun in the numeral phrase is overtly marked
for subject. If the following verb has a different subject, the noun
in the numeral phrase appears in the autonomous case, stripped of
its subject marking.     This situation is exactly parallel to what
happens in adjectival phrases, when the adjective is an underlying
verb (see chap. 17 for a discussion of the loss of the nominative
case marker in adjectival phrases).

  Numerals can be given verbal inflection when telling how many
people there are ina group. All numbers’can be inflected as ca-
stative verbs of class 3Ci; however, several can be inflected, at least
partially, as active verbs. The use of active versus stative inflection
for numerals is based on the subtle semantic distinction between
being a certain number by chance (stative inflection) or being a
certain number by choice (active inflection).

   Compound numbers are inflected as active verbs by inflecting the
final element of the numeral compound; as statives by the prefix
preceding the initial member of the compound, as in the following
examples.

   The numerals for the decades, which are formed with an element
pol- prefixed to the numerals from two to nine, are usually inflected
as stative verbs of class 3Ci or, more rarely, as active verbs of that
class or as an active verb of the class of the element to which pol-
is prefixed, as in the followirig example.

Ordinal Numerals
      Ordinal numerals are in use (if at all) only from one to ten,
although given the proper context, ordinal forms can be elicited for
numerals above ten,
                                  Stonosté:kan
        fifth                     stacahappf:kan

       eighth                     stontocci;nan
       ninth                      stacakka:lin
       tenth                      stapokkérlin
     With the exception of himd:kan and expressions telling the day
of the month, ordinal numbers are rarely used. Just like cardinal
numerals, ordinal numerals are verbs, and therefore have similar
syntax. If an alienably possessed noun is modified by an ordinal,
the ordinal precedes the noun, and the possessive prefix is infixed
into the ordinal (prefixed in the case of himéd:kan), as in examples
7 and 8° If an inalienably possessed noun is modified by an
ordinal,        the noun       retains   the     possessive   prefix, and   nothing   is
attached to the ordinal, as in examples 9 and 10.

   Sporadically, higher numerals will occur in adverbial form, as for
example, apoltékion ‘twenty times.” The adverbial numerals are
clearly derived from the cardinal numerals, with the general locative
prefix a- added before consonant-initial stems and the specific
locative prefix on- before vowel-initial stems (see chap. 4 for a
discussion of these prefixes), As the adverbial numerals are
basically verbs, it is possible for them to take verbal affixes, but
since they are used primarily as adverbs, they require the switch-
reference suffix -1 whenever they are used.

Numerals with Adverbial Suffixes
  Numerals can occur with four adverbial suffixes:                 -ndnna-, -:si-/
-o:si-, -ffizna-, and ~dhozsi-, which have specialized meanings when
used with numerals. The suffix -ndnna-, which in other contexts
means ‘all the time; constantly,” with a numeral means ‘n by n; in
groups of n,’ as below.
        one by onc; one at a time               caffa:kanannan
         two by two; two at a time              toklondnnan

        “They are sitting in groups of four.”
      The suffix -:si-/-o:si-, the diminutive/augmentive, with a numeral
means ‘merely n; only n,’ as below.
         only one                               caffa:ka:sin

      The adverbial suffixes -nénna- and -:si- can co-occur following a
 numeral, in the complex -:sindnna-,° which means ‘only n at a time,’

Causatives of Numerals
  The causatives of cardinal numerals are even less in use than
numerals themselves. They were obtained only in elicitation and
were said to be variant ways of expressing the division of an object
into parts. However, the causative numerals are basic to the telling
of time. In some numbers, causatives are formed by transforming
the segment -ka of to -/i and in all other numbers by affixing the
compulsive suffix -ci.
   Almost completely out of use and forgotten are the causativesof
adverbial numerals. Formerly these causatives would mean ‘to do
something nw times.’ The only one of these causative numerals that
has ever been observed in use is onosta:lin ‘to do something four
times.’   Because all ritual actions were done four times, this
particular verb has been preserved in use long after its sisters
became obsolete.

  The phrase hast ha:lahké means ‘sun movement’ and originally
meant ‘hour’ or ‘visible movement of the sun.’ In later times, with
greater familiarity with clocks and watches (called hasosi ‘little sun’
or hast sobayka ‘knowing the sun’) the phrase was transferred to the
movement of hands of the clock and now refers primarily to
minutes, although it is still used in its old sense, as in example 20
above.
  As elaborations of the time-telling process, the time word
followed by the switch-reference suffix -n and the verb topdtlin ‘to
pass through [sg]’ is used to express being past an hour, as in
examples 24 and 25. With the adverbial suffix -d:ho:si- a time word
indicates that it is almost an hour, as in examples 26 and 27.

      To ask what time it is, the verb ndmpon    ‘to be so many’ is
transformed by means of the suffix -ci into the verb nampé:cin ‘to
cause to be so many’ and inflected as a question, as in the following
example.

 Counting Months and Days
   The Koasati, like other American Indian groups, formerly had a
 system of named lunar months. This system has been obsolete so
 long that it has almost gone out of memory. However, with the aid
 of partial lists obtained in 1910 by John R. Swanton, and in the
 1930s by Lyda Taylor, a complete set of month names and their

   There are thirteen month names, as indeed there are nearly
thirteen lunar months in a solar year, Because the year is about
eleven days longer than twelve lunar months, the months have a
tendency to fall out of alignment with the seasons from year to year.
It is not clear how the Koasati handled this problem; it does seem
that planting (and thus na:sacthlihast) was fixed by the observance
of the Pleiades (hocitlokké-li ‘the Standing Stars’) just before their
final disappearance in the west at sunrise (about mid-April).”
  After contact with Europeans, the Koasati developed a system of

   Even though the month names in table 12.8 contain phonemes
and sequences that do not normally occur in Koasati, these forms
are, as a consultant put it, Kowassa-ti ico:wilikst sna:tickd, “spoken
with Koasati lips [i.e., accent].” Because of the universal use of
English outside the community, these loan words suffer severe
pressure to be normalized as much as possible to English phonetics;
thus ‘April’ is more often rendered éypritka than é:pa.
   To express the day of the month, the month name adds the suffix
-fé:kon, and the number of the day (ordinal numbers are used)
Suffixes -:/G:k, as in the following examples,

      To express an occurrence in a month, the suffix -fo:ka- is added;
to negate that expression, the complex ~fé:kokko- is used.

Mathematics
  The ability to do mathematics in Koasati is a skill that is no
longer widespread. With the decline in the use of numerals in the
language, all the disciplines based on the manipulation of numbers
have fallen into decline, Formerly, it was the custom for older
people to teach children mathematics using shelled beans to
illustrate the problems and mathematical operations. This custom
is reflected linguistically in the constructions used in mathematicss,
which can clearly be interpreted as referring to countable things,
not just numbers in isolation.
Addition
      The basic structure of an addition problem                 is:   Number,-1
anampo number, number,-DEL, which is equivalent to English
      ‘Two plus three is five,""

      ‘Ten plus fifteen equals twenty-five.’
Subtraction
   The basic structure of a subtraction problem is: Number,-fa
number,- onaist aléhka number,-DEL, which is equivalent to
English, ‘Number, minus number, equals number;.’ The verb
onat:sin‘to subtract’ here used in the aorist form, isa compound of
the prefixes on- ‘vertical plane,’ a- ‘general locative,’ and f:sin ‘to
take something.’         The whole complex literally means ‘to take
something from the face for surface] of.’

        *Two minus two equals zero.’
      The last example shows the verb fksor ‘not to exist,’ which usually
does not take internal changes, but takes the aorist to form iksé
Multiplication
      The basic structure of a multiplication problem is:                 Number,
number, number,-DEL,
                 which is equivalent to the English ‘Number,
times number, equals number,,’

                                         Notes
    1. Archaic   here refers to  a term  that  is remembe red   but never  occurs, even in
Sporadic use, such as: hofi ‘war,’ now ittihépka; kaski ‘warrior,
                                                                        ’ now solité:wa;
and ibisnéli wali:ka   ‘automob ile,’  now   mobi:la.  An   obsolete  term,  on  the
hand, is one that, though rarc, occurs S$poradically, such as; pici ‘mother,’        other
commonly mé&ma; and kakanahitké
                                                                                     more
                                         ‘mirror,’ more commonly ilifhica.
    2. The failure of the stative pronouns   to substitute changed  forms  before  a
vowel-initial numeral is notable. It may be that the expected forms, *akosta:k
*ahacisté:k, are too altered for easy comprehension.                            and
they have never been noted to occur together outside a numeral phrase.
       7. The months ocacitaili hast sad takkola hast, in particular, are of uncertain
location. The list of month names has been set up so that it can be compared with
lists of month names in other Muskogean languages, even though it is likely that
nazsacthli hast was the first month of the Koasati ycar,
    8. The term bihi refersto the European fig, although it is a reficx of the Proto-
Muskogean *k”ici ‘mulberry.’ The mulberry is named with a related term, bihala.
       9,     In a myth collected by Swanton in 1910, the Pleiades are linked to the
planting of pole beans and thus, perhaps, to planting in general.
      10. In this phrase, hoicifo may be a first person plural aorist form, rather than
a noun—compare holci:f ‘we name it’ (ho:ci:fon is—or was—a class 1B yerb.), The
first person plural is occasionally used to refer to a generalized or impersonal
action.
      11, Itis'a Mardi Gras custom of the French people in Louisiana for groups of
men to ride horseback from house to: house.                  The householder throws them a
chicken after which they rave; the man who catches it wrings its neck and attaches
it to his saddle, and the group rides on to another household.              This is called courir
de Mardi Gras.
      Note the total lack of religious reference in the terms for Good Friday and
Easter.        The Koasati as a group completely converted to Christianity only in the
late 1920s, even though missionary work had begun in the 1890s-
      12. These terms are actually agentive nouns, and are not cxactly equivalent to
the English glosses piven. The verb pathan, from which patha derives, has a verbal
noun, palitha ‘wideness,’ but the latter is not used in expressions of measurement.
      13.    There is an alternative construction that verbalizes the locative phrase, as
in this example;

            INCH BE: TEN AND TWO-sw FOOT-in-be-phr:term

 elaborate than any found in the other Muskogean languages. In
 addition to the case suffixes, which indicate the function of a noun
 in the sentence, there are suffixes that indicate that the noun has
 been previously mentioned and also locate that noun in time. Still
 other suffixes supplant the case suffixes and serve discourse rather
 than sentence functions.
 Case Suffixes
      There are seven different cases in Koasati, but no noun occurs
with more than six. The classical terminology for cases will be used
to name the cases of Koasati, but it must be understood that the
functions of these cases may not be, in all instances, their classical
ones. With this in mind, the following are the cases of Koasati:
nominative, accusative, autonomous, locative, allative, inessive, and
vocative,
      Nouns fall into five categories, depending on the cases with which
they are permitted to occur,   All nouns take the nominative,
accusative, and autonomous cases; of the remaining cases, some
nouns. take only the locative; others take the locative and allative;
still others take the locative, allative, and inessive; a few take only
the inessive; and another few take the vocative.
   Before the cases are individually described, it will be useful to
tabulate the five noun classes and the forms that the nouns take in
the various cases. These can be seen in the following table.

   These noun classes are semantically governed. Noun class I
consists of all nouns referring to animate objects, class II consists of
those nouns to which or in which an action may occur, class II]
consists of those nouns within which or among which an action may
occur, class IV consists of those nouns, usually describing an area
of some extent, within which an action may occur, and class V,
which could be considered a subclass of class I, consists of personal
names and a few kinship terms, which take the vocative case.
The Nominative Case
  The nominative case is marked by the suffix -k. It is used to
mark the actor of a transitive verb, as in examples 1 and 2, and the
experiencer of a stative verb, as in examples 3 and 4. Example 4
also shows that the appositive noun takes the same inflection as the
initial noun. This is true of all appositives in Koasati.

         “Tt is the case that my friend Rabbit is hurt,” he said.’
       The focus form of the nominative case, -ok, elides the final vowel
of the noun to which it is attached. This form adds more emphasis
to the noun in the sentence; however, it is nondistinctive for nouns
terminating in o. In such a case, only context can tell whether the
form is a focus form or not, as in the following example using the
words nifé ‘bear’ and fi:t6 ‘turkey.’

 simply as nasalization of the preceding vowel, especially if the word              |
 terminates in i. The accusative is used primarily to indicate the
 object of a transitive verb, as in examples 6 and 7; it is also used to
 indicate the object of certain transitive verbs that mark the object
 on the verb with the dative pronoun prefix set, as in example 8.

      The accusative suffix -n has a frequent allomorph, -@, which is
used in contexts where word order alone is sufficient to indicate
that the noun is the object of the verb. In such a case the noun
must precede the verb on which it depends, although a locative
expression may intervene.

   The zero allomorph of the accusative is not used when any
 ambiguity between it and the autonomous form of the noun could
 occur.
 The Autonomous Case
     The autonomous case is so named because it has no suffix and is
_ the form of the noun used in citations. Even though this case has
  certain dativelike functions, being the form uSed with the dative
  cross-referencing prefixes and the form used as the object of a
  postposition, nonetheless, its other functions—citation, possessing
  noun, form of a noun followed by an adjective, and vocative of
  nouns with no true vocative case—indicate that it is more than
  simply a dative. In the morphemic breakdown of the following
  examples, the noun in the autonomous case is italicized.
        In the       following    example,       the    autonomous         and    the   zero
 allomorph           of the accusative       case      co-Occur;     the   word   order   of
 subject, indirect object, direct object, and verb is what keeps the
 sentence from being ambiguous.

The Locative Case
  The locative case in Koasati is marked                by the suffix f@.   A
cognate suffix -fa occurs in Alabama (Lupardus 1982:93); both may
be related to the Yuchi locative fa (Ballard 1973). This case
indicates that an action takes place in or at a location. If an action
occurs on the ground, in water, or in a vertical or horizontal plane,

      The locative case can be verbalized with the suffix
 following example.
 The Allative Case
    The allative case is marked by the suffix -fon. This suffix is
 clearly made up of the locative case suffix @ plus a segment -on,
which looks like the accusative focus suffix  -on, one of the uses of
which, as shown above, is locative.          However, because the
combination        of the meanings          of the      two    suffixes      does   not
correspond to the allative case suffix, the latter will be considered
as monomorphemic,       The allative case indicates that actual or
metaphoric motion is taking place in the direction of the noun; the
meaning can be generally rendered as ‘to’ or ‘toward.’

       ""They also used to dwell over toward Shepherd [Texas].’
The Inessive Case
   The inessive case is marked by the suffix -hayo, which is clearly
related to the independent word hayé ‘interior; inside.” Historically,
this process’clearly is the result of a postposition fusing with a noun
(cf. hahcf apatahd ‘beside a river’ and hahcapataha ‘riverside’).
However, since the suffix -hayo frequently truncates the noun to
which it is suffixed (see the examples in table 13.1) and always
bears the single accent of the compound,’ it seems to have finished
the transition from postposition to case suffix. The inessive case
indicates location within an area with a conceivable boundary.

The Vocative Case
  The vocative case is marked by deletion of the final vowel of the
noun; if the noun ends in the segment -ka, that segment is deleted.®
The marked vocative case is used only with proper names and four
Kinship terms; all other nouns use the autonomous case for the
vocative.

Plurality and Case Marking
   A marked nominal plural in Koasati is permitted only for nouns
that refer to human beings. Most nouns which take a plural use the
suffix -ta; if the singular has the accent on the ultimate syllable,
then the suffix is accented in its place; if the accent is elsewhere,
accentuation    remains unchanged.             A few nouns, all historically
derived from diminutives, have the paucal plural suffix (two or
three) -ki and the multiple plural suffix (four or more) -ktha.
Because plurality in Koasati is expressed obligatorily only in the
verb (see chaps. 10 and 15), these suffixes do not occur frequently,
When they do occur, they have been noted only to take the
nominative, accusative, and autonomous cases. These suffixes
universally take the zero allomorph of the accusative suffix. For a
further discussion of these suffixes, see chapter 15.

Article Suffixes
  The article suffixes locate a noun in time and indicate that it was
previously mentioned. These suffixes come between the noun and
the subject and object case suffixes but follow the locative case
suffix -fa. The article suffixes are usually followed by the focus form
of the nominative or accusative suffix or by one of the discourse
suffixes; they also appear in the autonomous case. Four of the five
article suffixes are identical to the participial suffixes (see chap. 8).
Article suffixes occur almost exclusively in texts, and they vary in
frequency based on the way the text was recorded. Article suffixes
are very common in texts recorded by dictation, in which the
speaker had to wait until the listener had finished writing a phrase;

  The suffix -:sdya reminds the listener that the noun refers to
something spoken of previously, and does not include any
information on the placement of the noun in time,

 It has two uses: suffixed to nouns referring to specific persons, it
 indicates that the person being spoken of is dead (examples 58 and
 59); suffixed to other nouns, it locates them in the past and
 indicates that the action they participate in is true only for that time
 in the past (examples 60 and 61).

Discourse Suffixes
  Of the three discourse suffixes, -p and -o:t are quite frequent; on
the other hand, -Vy is extremely rare. The discourse suffixes do not
distinguish between nominative, accusative, and autonomous case;
only word order can tell the case of the noun when these suffixes
are used.    However, these suffixes permit the formation of two
locative cases, the locative and the inessive; the discourse suffixes
are suffixed to these case markers.
-p ‘new topic’
  This extremely common suffix indicates that the topic into which
a discussion is about to enter, or which is just finished, is new, or
contains new information.        This suffix has the allomorph -ap, which
occurs only with pronouns; additionally, the inessive case has not
been noted with this suffix, although it is a theoretical possibility.
As the subject of a verb:
62)   kancokfala-p naksofa Ohya i:sa-Vhei
      SPIDER-new:top SOMEWHERE              ALL DWELL(pl)-progress
      } kancokfalép naksofa Ohya i:séhei/
      ‘Now, spiders live everywhere.’
 In the locative case:
 64)    hini apatahd ohiy4:ci-Whoo-k naksofasdntik
        ROAD BESIDE BE:ALL:OVER-habit-ss EVERYWHERE
        is-hfsc-o-Y   tiksi-fa-p

        ‘They are all over alongside the roads, you can scc them everywhere in
         Texas.
Allomorph -ap with a pronoun:

       ‘As for him, he was skinny and thin, as you might expect,’
-0;t   ‘list’
   This semantically unusual suffix is also quite common. It is used
primarily to connect categorically similar nouns in a list and thus
could be equated with the English connective ‘and.’ However, it

 suffix is used on the noun to remind the listener what was being
 spoken of, as in the following examples.

                                            Notes
    I. Here the verb matimpéhkan is used in its old sense of ‘to call off fat a
distance) for someone.’ In this instance, it cannot refer to telephoning, as the text
from which this example is taken relates events which took place well before the
turn of the century. Telephones (not to mention electricity) did not become
common in this area of Louisiana until after 1940.
    2. This construction may actually be a form of locative expression. Afalék
hassén &ik would then mean “The morning glory is among the plants.’ This would
explain the use of the intransitive form of the verb ‘to be.’
    3. In Koasati mythology, Elephant (literally, Great-Onc-Who-Eats-Human-
Beings) was a carnivorous being that Rabbit finally transformed into a plant cater
and expelled across the ocean.
    4,    Every word in Koasati must have at Jeast one accent,         If 2 noun and its
suffix share an accent, the complex can be considered to form one word.
    5S.   The   inessive of itt6 ‘tree,’ idohayd,   is used to render the English terms
‘forest’ and ‘in the forest,’
    6. The deletion of -ka from native names in the yocalive scems to have led to
the use of the element -ka as a segment to be used to incorporate first foreign
names, and Jater loan words having an incompatible syllable structure into the
language. See chap. 16 for further discussion.
    7. The Koasati woman's name Tollice has an interesting origin.                  The
autonomous form of the name, faliska, was borrowed from the Cajun French name
Dalisca; however, the scgment -ka was interpreted as being the native marker of
loan words, and is dropped from the anglicization of the name.
    8. This example, an English name with English phonemes, shows that the
vocative case is still productive.
   9. These two nouns, nihtakoté and mistakoia, preserve archaic forms of nihta
‘day’ (Proto-Muskogean *nihtaka) and mi:ta ‘other’ (Proto-Muskogean *mi?taki
Creek i:ta, Apalachee miiak, Alabama minta).           The segment -ofa, derived from
the verb éeéan ‘to be there,’ is also found in the old words for spring aed autumn:
ohayyota ‘summer coming’ and tafota ‘winter coming.’
   10, The word na:siséntik is one from among a series of undeclinablé pronouns
that are all probably verbal phrases in origin (sec chap. 14 fora further discussion).
    Koasati has three groups of pronouns: independent, interrogative
and indefinite, and universal. There are five sets of independent
pronouns; the interrogative and indefinite pronouns can be used
with embedded questions. The universal pronouns are unique in
that they are indeclinable nouns and terminate in a consonant.
Independent Pronouns
   The      five sets of independent        pronouns   are the simple,   the
emphatic, the autonomous, the isolative, and the repetitive.

and to the verbal suffix -4:#1- ‘must.’ The element -a:ka:lo, which
derives the repetitive pronouns, does not have any related word or
suffix.
Simple Pronouns
   Since pronoun reference is usually marked on the verb by means
of the various subject cross-reference markers and the object
prefixes, the simple pronouns are used to indicate additional
information about the pronoun reference, as in the following
conversation,
1)     A: kaf-6a ci-ba,V7V,nna
       A: COFFEE-obj:foc Isstats-WANT,Q,
           : / kaf6n ciba7na? /

               { andk caban/
     9
        C: *] want some, too.’
     Simple pronouns are also used in topicalization constructions.
The pronoun is followed by the suffix indicating a new topic, -p,
which has the form -ap after pronouns. 2

Emphatic Pronouns
    Emphatic pronouns, some of the rarest pronouns in use, indicate
special emphasis on the role of the person to which the pronoun
refers. Such emphasis is best rendered in English by the pronoun
followed by ‘-self.’
     ‘I myself had completely forgotten, until he asked me, and ] am now sitting
       and thinking of it.’
Autonomous Pronouns
   Autonomous pronouns are rare, but they occur more frequently
than emphatic pronouns. They indicate that the person to which
the pronoun refers is solely responsible for the ensuing action.

Isolative Pronouns
    These pronouns indicate that the person to which they refer is
alone or unaccompanied in the performance of the action involving
that person.

Repetitive Pronouns
  Repetitive pronouns are the most uncommon of the independent
pronouns. They indicate that an action has been done once by the
subject, and is being redone in exactly the same way.

indefinite sense, Several of these examples can be perceived as
containing embedded questions.        Note in example 24 the
replacement of the indefinite pronoun naksé with the indefinite
form 4:ti, which       is in line with the bleaching of a7        of its root
meaning of ‘human being’ and its use as a marker indicating an
indefinite human, as in the verbal prefix a:t- (see chap. 4).

Universal Pronouns
      Universal pronouns as a class are unique in Koasati. Although
they are nouns, they are indeclinable, and, unlike other nouns, they
terminate in a consonant, k. Five of the six universal pronouns
terminate in the sequence -sdntik, which may be related to the
verbal phrase sdmmmitik ‘but it is how.’ Thus, the universal pronouns
may be verbal in origin, which would explain their indeclinability
and their termination in a consonant. Nonetheless, at present they
are used as nouns, and must be so considered.               The sixth universal
pronoun, naksofa:ka:lok ‘someone else,’ seems to be related to the
repetitive pronouns. Parallel to the indefinite pronoun né:si used
as an adjective, there is the universal pronoun naksdntik, which is
used only as an adjectve.

      Note the use of the indefinite pronoun 4:fi in the formation of
the term a:tiséntik ‘anyone,’ a form much more frequently used than
the comparable term naksosdntik.

       1,    Because of the lack of gender and number in the third person pronoun,
examples will be glossed 3:PRONOUN for simplicity’s sake.
    2. This situation may indicate that the independent pronouns originally ended
in -@, like the corresponding pronouns in Alabama (Lupardus 1982:65),
    3. The form naksé&n is derived from an unattested form *naksohén, which is
in turn derived from naksofén by an obsolete rule that converted f to A in
intervocalic position.

    There are two sets of noun prefixes, the am-set and the ca-set,
that indicate the person and number of the possessing noun.

The am-set
      The   possession    of most    nouns        is marked     with the am-set.
Historically, this set of pronouns was used to mark alienable
possession, but at the present it can be used with some kin terms*
and body parts, lexical items that usually take the ca-set. The
following is a paradigm of a noun taking this form of possession.

a relative of one’s own, especially if there is a hesitation between
using a first person singular and a first person plural prefix, as in

     As a general rule, plurality of a noun is not marked on the noun
itself, Rather, plurality of a noun subject or object is marked on or
within the verb on which the noun depends, as in the following
examples,

                                         Notes
    1. There are also three inanimate nouns derived with the diminutive suffix that
take this suffix to form the plurak fahcosi ‘stream,’ pl. hahcoskt; okhicast
‘window,’ pl. okhicaski; and talcosi ‘pebble,’ pl. falcoski. ‘The last item, at least,
does not always require the plural form when the semantics of a scatence in which
it is used call for plurality, These are the only inanimate nouns that form plurals.
    2. For pluralization of non-human animate diminutives, the independent word
lawista ‘small [pl]' is used. Thus, the plural of nifast ‘bear cub’ would be nif@
fawista “bear cubs,"" literally, ‘little bears.’
    3. The surname Robinson, rébosi, is construed by speakers as already being
a diminutive; thus, rabasi, depending on context, indicates either ‘a Robinson’ or
‘a Robinson child.’ However, in the paucal and plural the diminutive is distinct:
raboski ‘a couple of Robinson children’ and raboskiha ‘Robinson children,’ versus
rabosiha ‘the Robinson family.’
   4.      In other   Muskogean     languages,   such   as Mikasuki   (Derrick-Mcscua
1980:432-33), Crock (Haas 1948;245-46), and Seminole Creck (Nathan 1977:100-
104), items of cloth require a verb to have a dual form, and water requires a verb
to have a plural form. This system seems to be a specialization from a system of
mass and count nouns like that of Koasati.
    5. Nonctheless, the verbs used to mean ‘to lay down a globular object’ have a
singular, dual, and plural form: coko:li:cin, ciki:li:cin, and isd:cin.
   6.     Here too, there is a discrepancy between the verbs meaning for a large,
long, thin object to lic, and to lay down a large, long, thin object. In the latter case
there is the singular/plural verb pair ballé&lin/ballin, which refer to large, long,
thin objects considerably smaller than fallen trees, rivers, and roads (c.g., beaks of
herons and human corpses).
    7, Forcxample, with the verb (o dic; ilfin (sg) / hépkan (pl), ifa tree is dying
but not yet dead, iilin is used.    However, once it is dead, a tree becomes, for this

  There are three main methods of noun formation other than by
agentive or verbal nouns (or the obsolete Old Nominalization): by
the formation of diminutives, by compounding, and by borrowing
from other languages.
Diminutives
   Diminutives are freely derived from all kinds of nouns with the
suffix -si/-ost. The allomorphs are phonologically conditioned; -si
occurs after nouns which terminate in a or 0, and -osi occurs after
nouns terminating in i, which vowel the suffix elides. If a noun has
its accent on the ultimate syllable, the ultimate syllable of the
diminutive form is accented; if the penultimate syllable is accented,
the accented syllable is unchanged with the addition of the
diminutive suffix.
      Noun       Gloss             Diminutive      Gloss
      tayyi      ‘woman'           tayyosi         ‘girl’
      né:ni      ‘man’             na:nosi         *boy’
   As a general rule, the diminutive simply indicates a smaller
variety of the noun; however, at times the diminutive carries an

   A noun with an unsuffixed diminutive will always be singula
                                                                and
Animate diminutives take the suffixes -ki to mark paucal plural
-Kiha to mark multiple plural (see chap. 10). The plurals of
inanimate diminutives are formed by replacing the diminutive suffix
with the independent word /awfsta ‘small [pl],’ which frequently
fuses with the noun it modifies.                The following are examples of
plurals of diminutives.

                                                                 have
  An obsolete diminutive suffix of similar form, -o:si, seems to

been frequently used to derive kin terms and may have had
affective connotation.                 That   these      old   diminutives          are   true
diminutives is attested by the fact that they are inflected for paucal
and multiple plural, like other animate diminutives.
  The modern diminutive suffix has been used to derive some kin
terms, the most notable of which are cofosé ‘great uncle,’ from tcofi
‘maternal uncle,’ and (d:fasi ‘paternal uncle,’ from té:ta ‘father.’
Noun Compounding
   Nouns can be compounded with each other with relative facility.
There are two kinds of compounds;          compounds formed by
apposition, where each noun retains its shape and accent, and
compounds formed by conflation, where the final vowel of the first
noun is deleted by the initial segment of the second, which is the
only noun to retain its accent.        Compounds formed by apposition
will be written here as separate words even though there is no
hiatus between the two; only if the accent of the initial element is
lost will they be written together. The two forms of compounding
are not mutually exclusive, as can be seenin the following forms for
‘pine-cone,’ all of which are equally acceptable.

     Conflation        coyyimati                 coyyati
  If the compound noun is derived from a possessive phrase, the
compound will generally refer to a quality or possession of the first

Marked Loan Nouns
   Loan words are marked with the suffix -ka when the syllable
shape of the borrowed noun is incompatible with Koasati syllable
structure (i.c., when the noun is monosyllabic or terminates in a
consonant). If an English word is compatible with Koasati syllable
structure, it is borrowed without any additional morphology. For
example, the word mofor (the local dialect of English loses syllable-
final r) has been taken into Koasati as mé:ta. (In such words as this
the syllable that is stressed in English is lengthened and accented in
Koasati.) The suffix -ka seems to have been appended through the
interpretation that English personal names are equivalent to
Koasati vocatives of names derived from verbs ending in -ka; in
such Koasati names, the element -ka is dropped in the vocative.
From personal names, the use of -ka apparently has been extended
to other nouns.
   Frequently a word is borrowed ephemerally into Koasati from
English by means of the incorporative suffix -ka, for example

    7. The disappearance of vowel length in these compounds is the usual result
of a:CC sequence. Because sequences of ACC and 7CC also reduce to CC, vowel
length patterns like a glottal consonant. Koasati vowel length in native words may
                                                                              not

‘whale,’    Thus, this form may be a reflex of a Proto-Muskogean form such as
 *okixapox”ka, father than a new formation.
    9, This example shows how powerful the process of nominal derivation is. The
first clement is a negated verb with a verbal suffix and the second is a verbal noun
with two verbal prefixes.

    10. A shorter form of this compound is in usc, consisting of only the third
 fourth elements, talistjhaccat.
    11. The Caddo form comes from Wallace Chafe (personal communication).
 Koasati folk etymology relates their own tribal name to the phrase kowasitk ‘we
 are lost’: the Caddo folk etymology for the name of the Koasati relates it to the
 Caddo phrase kuyasadah (phonetically /ku”asadah/) ‘lam lost.’ The Koasati and
 the Caddo were neighbors in Louisiana during the nincteenth century, thus, if this
 similarity is a coincidence, it is an extraordinary onc,
    12. This phrase actually means ‘these are cypresses.’ The etymology of waksina
 is uncertain; however, there is no more phonetic alteration between ho akSus na?a
 and waksind than between naranja and yilahé.
      13. This phrase means ‘taboo serpent’ (hiwew means ‘taboo'). It is likely that
                                   with Atakapa, misunderstood hiwew as referring
 the Koasati, with little familiarity
  to a kind of serpent rather than as an adjective.
    In the native languages of Louisiana there are several interjections thal are
 almost identical to those of Keasati, such as Chitimacha 7e-hé ‘yes’ Koasati ihi
  (pronounced [ehé]) and Chitimacha ?/+hd ‘oh!’ (with disgust), Koasati Aisha ‘damn!’
     14, Redbone is a local English term for a person of mixed black, white, and
  Indian heritage; originally it was a derogatory term, but is coming to be used as a

Earlier loan names from French show even more striking phonetic adjustments.

   Modifiers of nouns and verbs are indistinguishable as a form
class. They are used to modify the meaning of nouns and verbs
and therefore they equivalent to English adjectives and adverbs.
Koasati modifiers are all nominal, even though most are derived
from verbs. In addition, noun modifiers are more basic than verb
modifiers, the latter being frequently derived from the former by
suffixation (e.g., palhikkg ‘slow,’ palhikkon ‘slowly’.
Noun Modifiers (“Adjectives”)
   Because in general noun modifiers are nominalized verbs, they
follow the modified noun—the adjectival phrase, if it may be so
called, is a nominalized verb phrase, with the components in the
order subject, object, verb (SVO), the most unmarked word order
in the language. Compare the following derived nominal phrases,
the first a derived agentive noun phrase, the second a derived
adjectival phrase.

Comparison of Noun Modifiers
   Comparison of modifiers is not common, nor have noun modifiers
been found nominalized and used as subjects or objects of other
verbs. This is due primarily to stylistic considerations, A native
speaker of Koasati prefers to make a comparison of equality rather
than one of inequality, of which a comparative construction basically
consists (see Kimball, 1989b). When a comparison of inequality is
 formed, the modifier is used invariably in its verbal form, inflected
 with the auxiliary verb mdzyan (class 2Ai) ‘to be more’; the standard
 of comparison is indicated by the dative prefix attached to the verb
 mé:yan. The modifier is joined to the auxiliary with the suffix -k if
 the statement is a comparative, with the suffix -t if the statement is
 superlative,

Internal Change and Modifiers
   In addition to the above method of forming comparatives, the h-
grade of the verb root can be used to form a kind of comparative.
Other internal changes are also used to form constructions similar
to, but not the same as, superlatives. In the following examples the
h-grade is used to form the comparative with the verb cé:ban, ‘to
be big.’

   The n-grade of modifier roots in combination with the h-grade is
used to produce a form with the meaning ‘it is A, as A things go.’
This form has been noted so far only in elicitation.

Syntax of Noun Modifiers
   The use of noun modifiers is not limited to the constructions
outlined above.        Frequently, when the semantics of an utterance
would, in English, call for a noun modified by an adjective, Koasati
has the modifier used verbally with the modified noun in a state of
quasi-incorporation. In quasi-incorporation, which occurs only with
noun modifiers, the modified noun occurs stripped of the subject or
object markers that would be expected with the modifier in a verbal
form, and the noun forms an integral part of the verbal phrase.
The following examples—all from texts, as quasi-incorporation has
not been noted in simple conversation— illustrate this form of the
use of noun modifiers.

      Demonstrative Modifiers
         In contrast to the great majority of all modifiers, demonstrative
      modifiers are nouns. In addition, most occur before the noun they
      modify. Their function is strictly demonstrative; they are otherwise
      unremarkable in form. Their first unusual feature is that they occur
      more often as independent words than as demonstratives; their
      second unusual feature is their use as locative demostratives. In the
      latter case some occur without any suffixes, while others take an
      element -d:li. The following list is ordered in terms of increasing
      distance from the speaker.
yard     ‘this [by         ‘this one [by
          speaker]'        speaker]’
yi: fa   “that [away       ‘thal one [away from     ya:fa     ‘there nearby’
          from speaker      speaker and
          and hearer,       hearer, but not too
          but not too       far off]
          far off]
m4       ‘that’            ‘that one""
                           “that one [by hearer}’
ma:fa    “that over        ‘that one over there’              ‘over there’
mazfa    ‘thal, way        ‘that one way over                 ‘way over there’
                           there’
akkd     ‘that, very far   “that one, very far      akkésli   “way, way over there [or
                           away [or out of                    out of sight]
                           sight]
  Demonstrative modifiers are not exclusive of each other, and one
speaker will not necessarily use the same demonstrative as another
when referring to an object at a middle distance.     Obviously, a
salient feature for Koasati demostrative choice is the position of the
hearer with respect to the speaker, which is not quite so salient in
English. (Note the two demonstratives in example 13.)

Verb Modifiers (“Adverbs”)
      Verb   modifiers, like noun        modifiers, are basically verbal in
nature, although there is a class of nominal verb modifiers and a
small class of independent adverbial words.               Those that are verbal
are related to the verb they modify by means of the various
connective and. switch-reference suffixes. Those that are nouns
attach the focus-object suffix -o to relate to the verb. The feature
that unites all verb modifiers is their position before the verb in
simple constructions.    Those adverbs that can be                       used   in
comparative constructions follow the verb they modify.
Adverbs of a Basic Verbal Nature
   The most frequent method of adverbial modification is to relate
the verb acting as a modifier to the verb to be modified by means
        / caconoskak pélké:ho:sin békl /
        ‘My heart is beating very fast.’

        BLACK:PERSON-subj
       / kimmisk, acihban i:s4hcotg atlocdk /
        ‘Because this was so, the black pcoplc lived miserably,’
      A related adverbial construction is formed with the addition of
the diminutive/intensive suffix -o:si-/-:si- followed by -1, which lacks
the intensity or sufficiency of action implied in the simple -1
construction,

      / anampéhcon pahlizcilit /
      ‘t made it whistle several times.’
   Another way to form adverbial constructions is to join the
modifying verb to the verb to be modified with the connective suffix
-t. This construction is used when the verb modifier can be
considered as an action taking place at the same time as the action
of the main verb.

        ‘When they poured it into the mortar, they pounded it really quite gently,’
      When the adverbial action can be applied as much to the subject
of the sentence as to the verb, the verb and its adverbial modifier
are related with the same-subject switch-reference marker -k. This
is not a very frequent construction.

Comparison of Verb Modifiers
      Just like comparison of noun modifiers, comparison of verb
modifiers is uncommon.              On the whole, the standard of comparison
is left unexpressed, although tacitly present in the dative prefix to
the verb md:yan. The construction of a comparative adverbial
phrase is identical to a comparative adjectival phrase; for a
comparative, the adverbial word in verbal form suffixes a -& and is
followed by the auxiliary verb inund:yan; for a superlative, it suffixes
- and is followed by the same auxiliary.

are not distinguishable from noun modifiers; only in their semantics
are they distinct. They are the semantic equivalents of English
prepositions. However, unlike English, which derives nouns from
its prepositions, in Koasati, on the whole, the postposition and the
postpositional noun are identical. Thus, the Koasati equivalent of
the English ‘out of; outside’ is acd, ‘in front of; front’ is bikké, etc.

   Certain words in table 18.2 occur more often in other functions
than as postpositions. For example, aba is more used as a noun
meaning ‘up’ or with accusative inflection, abén, as a verb modifier
‘upward.’
   When the semantics of an utterance call for a pronoun followed
by a postposition, the postposition is inflected with the ca-set of
possessive pronoun prefixes, as illustrated below with obda:li
“behind.”
              ac-obécli                          ‘behind me’

     1, The modifier arya, which mcans ‘all’ when following a noun, means ‘whole’
or ‘entire’ when preceding the noun, as in a:pihct Giya ‘all their bodies’; diya
a:pihci ‘his whole body.’
equation in Koasati.
     5. The English rendering ‘in vain' for métik is an unhappy compromise
between the involved circumlocutions produced by Koasati speakers 10 explain
maéxtik’s obvious unitary meaning, Ma&tik is used when some facet of the action
of a sentence is perceived as being wrong, faulty, or lacking in some necessary
quality. The use of an affirmative or negative verb scems not to affect the meaning
of a sentence with métik. The use of this adverb clearly nceds further study.
   6. These postpositions ending in the segment -ta are phonologically archaic,
The postposition apataha is derived from Proto-Muskogean “apafaxa ‘beside’
(Choctaw apata), and pilaha is from PM “pilaxa ‘toward’ (Choctaw pilah). The
reasons for the preservation of this element, usually lost in Koasati, are not clear
at present.
   7. The word apatahdé is used to mean ‘behind’ when speaking of objects that
do not have a natural division into a front half and a back half. Thus, to say ‘I hid
behind a tree,’ one must use apatahd: itd epatahd lénkalit, never *itto obdvli;
for to the Koasati minda tree does not havea front side     or a back sie.
    8. There is, however, a verb derived from the root /folha//, olhd&cin, ‘to draw
something toward oneself,’
   Interjections form an anomalous group of words. As a class they
have aberrant phonology, having five vowels (a, ¢, i, 0, «) with
apparent contrasting length in final position,’ an additional voiced
stop (g), an additional fricative (x), and an additional tonal contrast,
the falling (*). The following examples show minimal and near-
minimal pairs for these contrasts.
1)     hché       ‘giggling sound’
       hé;        ‘Go on!'
       xé         ‘Bad dog!’
2)     hiy        *Yick!’
       héy        ‘It is dripping,’
3)     ga         cry of surprise used by men
       kash       ‘He says it.’
       xa:        ‘Whew!’
   Interjections can consist of single-word utterances or several
words, the meanings of which may not have direct relevance to the
meaning of the whole phrase, as in the following obsolete
interjectional phrase.
4)       hin&p m4-p m6k alpiysa-V:mo-Vhco-k

  As a general rule, however, an interjection consists of only one.
word. In the following table of recorded interjections, the gloss is

Child Language
   The topic of child language has never received any attention in
Muskogean studies. In Koasati there is a small but distinctive set
of forms used by children. The forms are here classified with
interjections because they are one-word utterances that do not
follow usual rules for classification into nouns or verbs. It seems
that these particular children’s forms are most frequent when the
child is under the age of five or six and are gradually replaced by
adult forms, so that by the age of ten or eleven children’s forms are
sporadically used, and they are no longer used once children enter
their teens.” The following minimal list illustrates the most notable
children’s forms; almost certainly there are other forms that the
author did not have the opportunity to record.

wewo                    ‘grandfather’                awd
   The regular adult forms for ‘mother’ and ‘father,’ ma:ma and
fata, seem to be children’s forms in origin. Other terms for
‘mother’ are remembered: iski, which is no longer used, and pici,
which is still used by some older persons. There is no other term
for ‘father’ recorded, but from comparative evidence, it should have
been *itki,
                                             Notes
       1. This may be spurious. The interjection hé:, for example, may well have the
underlying form /héy/. Whenever the vowel i comes together with y the resulting
pronunciation is [i:]; the same may be true for ¢ and y.
     2. Other particles that sccm to serve discourse functions—such as mé, map,
mén, and mék—are discussed in chap. 21.
     3. This is a good example of the difficulty of translating from Koasati to
Engtish. The majority of the glosses for interjections in this chapter were derived
from the observation of the context in which the Koasati interjection is used, and
the English intorjection that would be used in the same context was supplicd as the
gloss.
       4. The variant forms for these interjections, arising from the presence of the
and is not simplya chance resemblance, First, it is a CV root, and native roots of
this form are very rare. Sccond, in the 1790s, two traders of English stock, Robert
Walton and John McLeod, are recorded as living in the Koasati town in Alabama;
their residence there would afford the opportunity for borrowings from English.
     9. Speaker B, a very young woman interpreting for her aged grandmother,
speaker A, did not understand the words bitka stotamaka             and thought her
grandmother had said bitka stamané&kah ‘T am finished with dance songs.’
   10. Adult speakers tend to dismiss the reality of children’s forms. Adults will
say something like, “It just wants to talk so bad, he says it however he can; it’s not
quite right, but we understand anyway.""
   Ll, Although it may just be a coincidence, the resemblance between the Koasati
children’s form na@inala and the Natchez ma-yanolg ‘I will slecp’ and nanolg ‘he
slecps' (from Mary R. Haas, p-c.) is striking.
Syntax
  The syntax of a language is usually the most complex topic that
a grammar has to cover; the syntax of Koasati is no exception. The
following discussion covers word order and word order variation,
gapping, switch-reference marking, verbal conjunction, conjunctive
and disjunctive words, and sentence particles—which are either
operations within a phrase or sentence, those that link sentences
together, or those that operate on the discourse level.
Word Order
   The most unmarked word order of a sentence is subject, object,
verb (SOV). If there is an indirect object and the direct object is
not present in the sentence, the order is subject, indirect object,
verb (SIoV). If both a direct and indirect object are overt, the
order is usually subject, object, verb, indirect object (SOVIo),
although SIoOV can occur (see chap. 13, example 17). If there is
a locative phrase (a noun in one of the locational cases, a noun
followed by a postposition, a locational noun), it follows the verb
(SOVLo¢).
  Although the above schemata show the most unmarked word
order in the language, because Koasati employs nominal cases, a
                                                                513
sentence; verbs have no such morphological machinery to convey
focus. Indeed, some of the more unusual word orders in Koasati
seem to be the result of allowing verbs to take primacy over nouns
for various reasons. Although subjects and objects are the focus of
the following discussion, word               order variation involving these
elements can result as much from linguistic attention on the verb as
from a real change in a noun’s prominence.
Supecr
   The most unmarked position for the sentence subject is before
the yerb in intransitive sentences (example 1) and before the object
and verb in transitive sentences (example 2).

     When a subject should logically occur between the elements of a
verbal complex, it is moved to a location after the verbal complex
in order to prevent a disjunction of its elements, as in the following
example.

     ‘The aforementioned black people cleared fields, made fences, plowed, and
      planted cotion.’
In example 6, the verbal complex prevents the object, paykahatka,
from preceding the verb acfhlit, as it should logically do; it also
prevents the subject from preceding the verb.
Osrecr
   The most unmarked position for the object is after the subject
and before the verb, as in example 2. If the subject is cross-
referenced on the verb and does not have a nominal realization, the
object can occur as the first element of the sentence, as in the
following.

     / kapedé sténtatoho:f&k. .../
     “When we took carthworms there. .. .”
   The order with the object following the verb is quite unusual.
SVO does occur in contexts where there is greater emphasis on the
verbal element, as in example 8.
from English.'
  Example 6 shows how the object is moved if it comes between
members of a verbal complex; with a nominal subject the order is
VOS.      The order VSO never seems to occur.
Inpirecr Ogsecr
     The indirect object is cross-referenced on the verb by the dative
set of pronominal prefixes (am-).               With non-third person indirect
objects there is almost never a nominal indirect object. With third
person nominal indirect objects, the most unmarked order is for the
indirect object to follow the verb, as in the following example.

      As with other sentence elements, if the position of the indirect
object should logically come between the elements of a verbal
complex, its position is shifted. The only examples so far noted
shift the indirect object to before the verb complex, and when there
is an overt direct object, the indirect object precedes that, as in the
following example.

      / c&bakok 46ykaton imi:safa/
      “The horse returned to their house.’
   The locative phrase can be emphasized by being brought to the
head of the clause, and a locative phrasein any position but directly
after the main yerb is emphasized to some degree.
Phrase initial Jocatives:

      / naks6:li sobfiykosk, iscobafa amd:katon /
      ‘Because they did not know. who it might be, to the church they went.’
  A lesser degree of emphasis obtains if the locative phrase
appears before the verb but after the subject of the sentence, as in
      / afal6k cafhayé nécho:p, kénké:hosimaé:m /
      ‘If in the fields there is morning glory, it seems (o be very bad.’

Double locatives occasionally occur; the locative elements can occur
together at the end of the phrase, as in example 16, or separated,
as in example 17.

   A noun subject or object may also be gapped in a complex
construction if there is no switching of reference from that noun to
any other, The following is an example.

      ‘There used to be gold long ago, but it is the case that now it never exists.
       I do not even know what its appearance is like.’
  Verb gapping does not occur frequently, but it does have one
notable use. When asking what someone is doing when one cannot
       / n&son 6nci? /
       ‘What are you. . . 7’
21) ahiss-6n 0,V?V,m-ci
    MEDICINE-obj:foc BE,Q,-2ss(2A)
       / ahiss6n 6nct? /
       ‘Is it medicine that you are... 2”
The answer is also frequently gapped          in the same way, as in
examples 22 and 23.
22)     kaf-én 6mmi-l

       { nipén 6mmil /
        ‘Tt is meat that    Tam. ...'
      Unlike the English equivalents for the last four examples, Koasati
forms are complete sentences. However, if full comprehension is
desired, full forms of the answers can be substituted,     Examples 24
and 25 are the full forms for examples 22 and 23.

 undergo gapping by the deletion of the element é7mi, the verb
 émmin inflected for the interrogative, In such gapped sentences
 there is no verbal marking of the interrogative, only the initial
 element of the complex, which is not basically interrogative in
 nature.
 Switch-reference Marking
   In chapter 4 switch-reference marking was discussed in relation
to the order in the verbal suffix string in which these suffixes occur.
There are two basic switch-reference suffixes, each with a focus
form.      The suffix -k (focus form -ok) indicates that the following
verb has the same subject as the previous verb; the suffix -1 (focus
form -on) indicates that the subject of the following verb is different
from the previous.
The same-subject switch-reference marker -k:

        “He Iay there for about two hours (it was like a fever), and it [the siezurc]

      The following examples show the interactions of the two kinds of
switch-reference markers in a discourse context.

   Sometimes a verb in an independent sentence in conversation will
have a switch-reference marker if there is some kind of direct
relationship or change in topic from that of the previous speaker.

Relative Clause Equivalents
  Unlike many other languages of the world, which have special
constructions and vocabulary to handle relative clauses, Koasati
does not have any distinguishing features that mark certain clauses
as being relative. However, it does have constructions that are
translated as relative (even though in this language’s own terms they
are not “relative”), and it is these constructions that will be
discussed in this section.
   Very frequently, the Koasati translation equivalent of a relative
clause is a participial phrase, which is in its own terms a kind of
noun phrase. A participial construction is frequently used if the
noun to be “relativized” is in a locative case,.as in the following
examples.

          Portrait of Istima-facki,
after a lost original by John Trumbull, 1796!
  The Koasati language belongs to the Muskogean family, which
consists of Alabama (its closest relative), Creek, Mikasuki, Choctaw,
and Chickasaw as well as the extinct languages Hitchiti and
Apalachee. Koasati is spoken primarily by about three hundred
and fifty people living in southwest Louisiana. A much smaller
number of speakers (probably fewer than fifty) can be found on and
near the Alabama-Coushatta Indian Reservation near Livingston,
Texas.   Many Alabama speakers are reported also to have a
knowledge of Koasati, although their degree of fluency is not
known. Outside Texas and Louisiana, there do not seem to be
more than a dozen Koasati speakers, all of whom are of Louisiana
origin. These people are widely scattered: in Talahina, Oklahoma;
on the Navajo and Zuni reservations, and on the Umatilla
Reservation in Oregon.’ More people of Koasati origin, but who do
not speak the language, can be found in the old Choctaw Nation in
Oklahoma, where their part-Choctaw ancestors migrated about the
beginning of the present century.
  In Louisiana the Koasati live in households scattered over a
thirty-square-mile area north of the town of Elton; a few families
live in Elton itself. The area is still forested, with some clearings,
 Jocations. In low-lying areas are found cypress (waksind), tupelo
 (hikaht), honey locust (tat), swamp cherry (tithomma), and crab
 apple (sattilbi). Minor components of the pine forest include the
 various species of oak (itté hind:ba ‘live oak,’ itté hémma ‘red oak,’
 iné ciska “post oak,’ okwanti ‘water oak,’ cilaké ‘blackjack oak,’ and
 bost6 ‘overcup oak’) as well as red maple (iptimithatké), beech
 (nof6), hickory (ocd), basswood (batahké), magnolia (tolacobé), and
 other trees. Formerly, in cut-over areas sweetgum (Kafold) was the
 first tree to regrow; however, at present it has strong competition
 from     acacia   and   especially   from    Chinese    tallow    tree,   both
introduced into the area in this century. The latter now forms
dense groves along some sections of Bayou Blue.
   Of the many birds in the forest, some species, such as the
whooping crane (warola) and peregrine falcon (atan@), have been
extinct so long that they are known only by report; other species,
such as egret (foshatka), great blue heron (wahkacayhdé), and
Sparrowhawk (salikif), are common, and some, such as blackbird
(okcat#i), during certain seasons stream across the sky in great
numbers. Animal life, especially of the smaller Species, is abundant,
Rabbits     (cokfi), raccoons     (sawé),    Oppossums     (sokhatké),     and
armadillos (pa:satta) are common, as are deer (icé).              Most larger
animals, including wolves (wasé), mountain lions (kowi), bobcats
(Kawaknasi),and bears (nitd), have been killed off by non-Indians.
The latter two species reportedly still exist in remote sections along
Bayou Nezpique.
   In addition to many non-poisonous snakes     —such   as   egg  snakes
(abacala), water snakes (osawd), and garter    snakes  (cinto   sapsiwa )
>—venomous snakes abound, includin      g  copperh eads    (ittiltapatkt),
water moccasins (hiwd), and rattlesnakes (cinto coba).             Pigmy
rattlesnakes (hacolaycf )are especially dangerous and frequently are
abundant; they are generally avoided, although sometimes they are
killed for their meat.
   Present Koasati culture is of mixed origin. Their technology is
almost entirely of Western origin, while their social life and customs
are, with the notable exception of their adherence                   to
Congregational Christianity (and other minor protestant sects),
aboriginal. The Koasati are, on the whole, opposed to ethnological
enquiry and resent non-Koasatis prying into the nature and extent
of their aboriginal culture. They believe that their traditional
culture (athémma imolpind) is the sole property of the Koasati
themselves and should not be revealed to outsiders.* At one time
this attitude extended to the language itself; community members
were opposed to teaching the language to non-Indians, and until the
1930s they taught outsiders interested in the Indian language the
Mobilian Trade Jargon (yamé@) to maintain linguistic distance
between themselves and non-Indians (see Drechsel 1979),
Historical Sketch
Protohistoric and Colonial Periods, 1540-1795
  The Koasati have been identified with the archaeological culture
called the-Dallas Focus, located in the upper Tennessee River
valley (Lewis and Kneburg 1946; Bauxar 1957). At the beginning
of the historic period, the Koasati inhabited the upper Tennessee
valley from above the mouth of the Hiwassee River downstream to
the northward bend of the Tennessee.      The middle section of the
Tennessee valley seems to have been inhabited by the Tuskegee
(also spelled Taskigi or Casquigi; cf. the Koasati kaskf ‘warrior,’
paucal plural suffix -ki), and the lower Tennessee valley by the
                                                       f affairs when
 De Soto passed through Koasati territory in 1540 (Swanton 1922).
   Little can be discovered of their history for almost the next two
 hundred years. The Beaver Wars of the 1670s, themselves little
 known, seem to have devastated the inhabitants of the Tennessee
valley (Hunter 1978:588-93). Early eighteenth-century maps, based
on data gathered many years before, show the Kaskinampo,
Tuskegee, and Koasati gathering together on an island in the
Tennessee River.     In addition, the introduction of European
diseases almost certainly contributed to a steep decline in
population.
   When the Koasati appear again in the historical record, in the
 second decade of the eighteenth century, they are found dwelling
 below the confluence of the Coosa and Talapoosa rivers in what is
 now south-central Alabama. Sieur d’Anville’s Carte de la Louisiane
of 1732 is the first map accurately showing the location of the
Koasati; it also names the nearby villages: Takiki (Tuskegee),
Tamaita (Tamahitan), two Pacana (Muskogee-speaking) villages,
and the Alabama villages of Oucchanya (Oakjoy) and Tomonpa.
This grouping indicates that a group of refugee tribes from the
north emigrated together to this safer locality, in the same way that
a group of Shawnee did somewhat later. The name of the Koasati
town varies considerably in the records of the eighteenth century.
In the French period, at the beginning of the century, it was
frequently spelled Conchati; in the Spanish period, Cusate; and in
the American period, it was often Coosawda.
   In the 1770s the Koasati began to play a prominent role in the
affairs of the developing Creek Confederacy. They traded in both
Mobile and New Orleans and had close contacts with the Spanish
in the two cities, as well as with the Chickasaw. At this time they
were under the leadership of the independent and energetic chief
opposition to certain policies of the Confederacy—one of which was
a proposed war on the Chickasaws—and because of his good
relations with the Spanish of Louisiana, he and 214 followers left
their homes   in 1795, traveled   to New     Orleans and   Mobile   for
supplies, then removed to a location sixty miles from the confluence
of the Red and Mississippi rivers (Nunez 1958:19-20).
   Somewhat earlier (at the time when a large number of Alabama
had emigrated to Louisiana), and unnoticed by most contemporary
writers, a portion of the Muskogee-speaking town of Pacana,
formerly located near the Koasati, removed to Louisiana, In 1805
they were noted by Sibley (Jefferson 1806:51) as dwelling on the
Caicasieu River, The existence of this group, almost unnoticed by
Europeans, would have important consequences for the Koasati in
the mid-nineteenth century.
The Koasati Remaining in Alabama, 1795-1940
  The population of the town of Coosawda was drastically reduced
by the emigration of Red Shoes and his followers; nonetheless, it
remained important in the affairs of the Confederacy; one of its
members was a signatory to the Treaty of Limits of 1802 with the
United States.
  The next leader-of       the    Koasati    was   Nomatlee    Imautla
(inhoma‘hta imata ‘Leader Going About’), more commonly known
as Captain Isaacs.   When Tecumseh          and the Shawnee Prophet
visited the Creek, even though Tecumseh spoke in Coosawda,
Nomatiee Imautla opposed him and when the Creek civil war broke
out supported the Creek who had not revolted. The United States
intervened, ostensibly as a result of the Fort Mims           Massacre
(where, however, the majority of the victims were loyal Creeks), but
 the final removal of the Creek from Alabama.
    During this unsettled time, Coosawda still played an important
role, especially toward the end of the period. Numerous councils
were held at Coosawda, and a new Koasati leader, Cochah Hadjo
(ka-cca ha-co ‘Recklessly Brave Tiger’), was signatory to Creek
letters and petitions to the U.S. government. He is the last known
leader of those Koasati who did not emigrate to Louisiana. Little
is written of those Koasati after the removal to Oklahoma that
began in 1836. It is known that a few Koasati lingered on in
Alabama as late as 1847.° In Oklahoma, the Koasati divided into
two towns, called Quassarte no. 1 and Quassarte no. 2, This
division of an already small population, coupled with their removal,
seems to have accelerated acculturation. The final notice of the
Koasati who did not emigrate to Louisiana was in the Creek census
of 1891 (Debo 1941). The population of Quassarte no. 1 was 79,
and Quassarte no. 2 had a population of 48, a total of 127 persons.
At some time in the next quarter-century, Quassarte no. 2
disappeared. In 1939, Quassarte no. 1 federated with the town of
Alabama to form the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town. In the
preamble to the constitution of the tribal town, the people of
Quassarte identify themselves as Creeks,
The Koasati beyond the Mississippi and in Texas, 1795-1870
  The Koasati did not remain long at the site on the Red River, but
soon moved on (Nunez 1958;21-22). They seem to have established
their primary village on the Sabine River (Jefferson 1806:51), the
location of which was six miles north of the confluence of Bayou
Anacoco and the Sabine. A secondary village was established on
miles north of its mouth.
  The Koasati kept on good terms with the Spanish and with other,
immigrant European groups; they frequented the newly established
iown of Galveston (Koasati kalfisti) to trade (Yoakum 1856:197),
and they aided the ill-fated French colony of Champ d’Asile on the
Trinity River (Hartmann and Millard 1819:33-36), Their relations
with most of the native Indian groups of Texas were good
(Jefferson 1806:51). However, they were enemies of the Tonkawa
and the Comanche,
   At this point, the Koasati had reached a peak in numbers and
prosperity which, after the disasters of the late 1830s, they would
‘never achieve again. This prosperity is reflected in the census taken
of them by J. Francisco Madero in 1831 (Smither 1932:90-1). They
lived in two villages, Colete and Battista, with a total population of
426.   The paramount chief was Long King; the subchiefs were
Nekima and Keileite (later known as Kalita).’        Koasati stability
began to dissipate in the later 1830s. They suffered from epidemics
of dysentery in 1833 and in 1839. Beginning in 1839, there also
were troubles with white settlers who had begun to move into the
Trinity River area. The Koasati chief was now Kalita; both Long
King and Nekima had apparently died, Kalita petitioned Mirabeau
Buonaparte Lamar, president of Texas, concerning the depredations
of the settlers, and Lamar interceded on his behalf (Gulick et al.
1931 11:16-17, 39).
  At the petition of the Koasati and Alabama, the Congress of the
Republic of Texas granted them each a reservation in 1840
(Smither 1932:94). However, a surveyor was not sent out until
1843; he reported that the Battista village had been occupied by
whites who would not return it; Colete village was owned by a white
man who permitted the Indians to continue dwelling there. He also
noted that the Koasati numbered only 135 to 140 (Winfrey 1959, I,
146-47).   Although the epidemics of 1833 and 1839 were partially

the Koasati around th
that the Koasati settled either near or among the Pacana.
   Kalita died sometime after 1842; his son, Chickasaw Abbey,
became    chief of the Texas Koasati (Smither 1932:100).             The
Koasati never obtained the reservation promised them, Some
moved onto or near the Alabama reservation when it was set up;
others remained near Shepherd, Texas.         A slow but steady
migration to Louisiana shrank the latter group; finally, in the late
1880s or early 1890s, Chickasaw Abbey’s son, John Abbey,
emigrated to Louisiana, where he became chief. The history of the
Koasati in Texas since about 1860 has been indistinguishable from
that of the Alabama;     little appears on the Koasati in Texas after
1844,
The Koasati in Louisiana, 1840-Present
  The    Koasati   who   returned   to Louisiana   settled   along    the
Calcasieu River.    Over 250 persons were living there about 1860
(Jacobson 1960:105); present-day tradition says that the Indians
lived in scattered household groups between the Whiskey Chitto
and the Calcasieu, primarily in the area of the present town of
Indian Village. In addition to the Koasati and Muskogee, a band
of Choctaw lived along the Calcasieu. In 1884, the Indian Village
site was sold out from underneath the Indians (Jacobson
 1960:105-6).   With the help of a white friend, the combined group
of Indians homesteaded land north of Elton, Louisiana, seventeen
 miles from their former home.       Each family head received 160
 acres;’ the holdings of the Indians were thus approximately three
 thousand acres. Their numbers continued to decline; around 1908
 there was a major emigration of people of Choctaw descent from
 the Louisiana settlement     to Oklahoma,    as part of the second

he attempted to travel to Washington, D.C., to get aid for the
Koasati, but he did not reach his destination.” His failure seems to
account for the Koasati’s unprecedented replacement of Jackson
Langley with a new chief, about 1930. The new chief was the son
of John Abbey, Jefferson Abbey (Koasati name sacikilli). With his
interpreter, Douglas John, he went to Washington and apparently
persuaded the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to offer some
educational services, in addition to the Congregational Church
school (opened about 1905).'' Some contract medical services were
also provided.
  The Koasati held no trust land; the Indians all owned their tracts
of land individually. As time went on, a number of tracts of land
were sold or seized to pay back taxes. The primary purchaser was
the Bell Estate, which added these tracts to its extensive forest
holdings in the area. By the 1960s, Indian-owned land was reduced
to about 1,300 acres, widely scattered in the forest north of Elton.
   Jefferson Abbey died in 1951. In the election of 1952 there were
three candidates for chief: Jefferson Abbey's son, Martin Abbey;
his grandson Bel Abbey; and his interpreter, Douglas John, Martin
Abbey won the election and became chief. Then, in 1953, the
United States cut off all aid, apparently in conjunction with the
termination of the Alabama-Coushatta Reservation in Texas.
Martin Abbey made numerous trips throughout Louisiana trying to
get help of some kind for the Koasati; he even managed to interest
newspapers in the Indians (Reed 1965). The Koasati were still
unable to gain federal recognition, however, and by 1970 it became
clear that they would have to organize a government according to
BIA plans before such recognition could take place.    Accordingly,
Martin Abbey stepped aside as the representative of the Koasati,
though he retained the title of chief. A government was organized
through the aid of the Association on American Indian Affairs
(AAJA), an Indian rights organization, and Ernest Sickey* became

for a community center, including a health center. The tribal
government provided a good deal of employment for needy people,
either directly or through Comprehensive Employment and Training
Act (CETA) funds. In addition, housing rehabilitation was begun.
Medical services were extended to all tribal members. Trust land
increased from the 15 acres purchased through the AAIA in 1972
to 135 acres in 1977, and housing for landless Indians was erected
on the trust land.
   This period abruptly ended with the Republican victory in the
1980 national elections, Funding was cut severely; CETA funding
was eliminated entirely. The housing rehabilitation program came
to a halt, and     medical    services   were   withdrawn   from   all but
chronically ill tribal members.    Disaffection with the tribal
government grew, and, catalyzed by an attempt to establish bingo
on the reservation,     Ernest Sickey was ousted as tribal chairman in
January 1985,
   Several years of severe political turmoil ensued. Because Edwin
Poncho, who had replaced Sickey as tribal chairman, had long lived
away from the community, his legitimacy was not recognized by the
whole tribe, and in June 1985 Leroy Sylestine was elected tribal
chairman. The situation was so disturbed that the Choctaw Agency
of Mississippi, under whose aegis the Koasati fell, was obliged to
send Indian policemen to the reservation to maintain order.         More
federal funds began to become available, housing rehabilitation was
restarted, and medical services were re-extended.           In addition, a
communal    field was     established    to grow   vegetables   for tribal
consumption.     Nonetheless, the political situation had become so
unstable that Sylestine was forced to leave office, to be replaced
briefly by Barry Langley, and he in turn by Beverly Poncho. Finally,
after the election of Lovelin Poncho        as tribal chairman in 1988,
relative calm was restored.
   Prospects for amelioration of the financial situation depend
entirely on the vagaries of national politics. The community does

 Mrs. Donald Johnson of Kinder, Louisiana.
   The next professional linguist to study Koasati was Mary R. Haas,
 who engaged in fieldwork in 1938 and 1939. Besides vocabulary
 and paradigmatic materials, she also gathered texts (Haas; n.da),
and has published various articles on the language (e.g,, 1944, 1946,
1949, 1950). In the 1960s the anthropology department at Tulane
University employed Bel Abbey to assist a linguistic field methods
course; the author began fieldwork on Koasati in one of those
classes in 1977. Tape recordings and other materials on the
language gathered in these classes are preserved in the department.
  Additional fieldwork on Koasati was done by Thurston Dale
Nicklas in the 1970s (n.d.) with a speaker who had migrated from
Louisiana         to   Oklahoma;     by    Frank   Trechsel    (1977),   who    did
fieldwork in Louisiana; and at present by Roy Jones of Rice
University, who does his fieldwork in Texas. Between 1980 and
1988 linguistic work was being done, first by Gene Burnham of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), and later by David Rising of
SIL, in order to translate the Bible into Koasati. SIL withdrew its
fieldworkers in late 1988.

 // is voiced, fortis, and unaspirated in all positions.              It is unusual
 not only in that it is assymetric, but   also  in that  it patterns more
 frequently with resonants than with Stops.            For example, the
 underlying cluster /bl/ surfaces as /bb/, just as underlying resonant-
i clusters surface as a geminate resonant. This does not occur with
other stop-/ clusters. /b/ also has a nasal quality, which is noticeable
when a geminate /b/ is affected by the h-grade (see chap. 9).
Fricatives
   There are four fricatives: /f/, /4/, /s/, and /h/. /f/ is a bilabial
fricative, [4]. A now-obsolete rule changed /f/ to /h/ intervocalically;
this rule becomes more comprehensible when it is realized that /f}
comes from Proto-Muskogean *x” and /h/ from Proto-Muskogean
*x. /¥/ is a lateral fricative, [4]. The fricative /s/ has a number of
allophones. It has the dental allophone /s/ when it occurs as any
member of a consonant cluster or initially in a word before /a/. It
has the alveolar allophone /s/ in word-final position and initially in
a word before /i/, and the palatal allophone /S/ intervocalically and
initially before /o/.

     sopatlit             [Sopauit}           ‘She cleaned it.’
There is also sibilant harmony among the allophones of /s/ in
syllables of the shape sVs; in such a syllable the allophone of the
initial /s/ harmonizes with that of the final /s/, as in séslit ‘he skinned
them,’ which is pronounced [séslit], not *[Soslit]. Finally, there is
a rare allophone of /s/ in final position, [r], a voiced continuant.
     o:tammos             [o:téammo:r]        ‘Tt is just sunset.""
     shofahnays           [somahana:r]        ‘It is owing down.’
  The fricative /h/ also has a number of allophones. Word-initially
and intervocalically, it is a voiceless aspirate. Word-finally, /h/ is a
voiceless continuation of the preceding vowel. In the speech of
men, final /h/ is difficult to distinguish from the prolongation of any
word-final yowel which is typical of their speech. However, in the
speech of women, who close off all vowel-final words with a glottal
stop, it is easy to distinguish, as in the following:
     Woman Speaking     Man Speaking      Phonemic Form           Gloss
     [isk6nna?]         {iskénna:]        iskénna                 ‘low’

As an initial] member of a consonant cluster, /h/ has a variety of
phonetic realizations. It can be a voiceless continuation of the
preceding vowel, as in ilféhnot, [ilté6not), ‘she worked’; it can be an
aspirate followed by an open transition, as in [ilt6hanot]; or it can
be pharyngealized, as in i:pdhci, [i:pifici}, ‘she is eating.’ The
pharyngeal allophone of /h/ occurs primarily before /c/, although
                                                             eceding consonant if
 that consonant is a stop or fricative.                  With stops, /h/ forms an
 aspirated unit.

With fricatives, /h/ assimilates partially to the point of articulation
of the preceding fricative.

Resonants
  There are five resonants:            two nasals, a lateral, and two glides.
The nasals are the bilabial /m/ and dental /n/; the glides are the
bilabial /w/ and the palatal /y/; the lateral is A/, In a few words /I/
interchanges with /n/, as in intolihnd ‘work’ for ilolihnd.
Additionally, /l/ has a rare alveolar continuant allophone {r] in
intervocalic position.

     fol4yhki                   [forayhki}                     ‘woman's personal name’
There is no possibility of confusing the [r] allophone of /I/ with the
[r] allophone of /s/, as the latter can occur only word-finally, and the
former can occur only word-medially.
operation of the n-grade, which causes morphemic. nasalization.
Word-finally, nasalization is the result of a nasalizing phrase-
terminal marker. Therefore, although nasalized vowels will be
written in this work, it must be realized that nasal vowels are not
autonomous phonemes in Koasati.
  The short vowels /i/ and /o/ are shifted in articulation to [1] and
[u] in closed word-final syllables. In addition, /i/ has the allophone
[1] in all closed syllables.
     *hOKAY                    [hokfit]               ‘She put it on.’
      fikbot/                  [ikbut]                ‘He did not kill it.”
Rarely, /i/ will have the allophone [e] and /o/ will have the
allophone [u].
      fyilahd/                 [yelahd]               ‘orange [fruit]’
      fsolité;wa/              [sulita:wa]            ‘soldicr’ (not *{Sulita:wa])
The reasons for these allophones is not clear, but it must be noted
in these two cases, the words                are ultimately loanwords         from
Spanish: naranja and soldado.
   Of the long vowels, only /i/ undergoes an articulatory shift in
closed final syllables, to [e:).
      Mize}                    {hé:c}                 ‘He sees,”
Even this allophone is variable, and can be heard ranging from [i:]
to [e:].
   in the speech of men, all vowels in open word-final syllables are
prolonged. In this environment, /i/ has the allophone [¢]. In the
speech of women, however, open final syllables are closed with a
glottal stop, and /i/ for them has the.allophone [1].
Marginal Phonemes
  There are two marginal phonemes in Koasati, the glottal stop [?]
and vowel nasalization,   Both are at once the reflection of
morphemes and the result of morphophonemic processes.
The Glottal Stop
   The glottal stop is a morpheme infixed before the penultimate
syllabie of a verb to indicate the interrogative; it induces high pitch
accent in each of the flanking syllables. The glottal stop can occur
before any consonant; it replaces vowel length but is deleted before
4 consonant cluster, with only the distinctive accents remaining to
indicate the interrogative. In careful speech, there is an open
transition between the glottal stop and a following consonant; in
rapid speech it is a true cluster.

     fishi:c/        {ishé:6]            “You sce it.""

     [ishi7cA}       [ishi76t4]          [sii2e4)        ‘Do you see it?""
   The glottal stop is inserted between the members of a vowel
cluster and occurs after word-final vowels in the speech of women.
This use of the glottal stop is purely phonetic, and its deletion does
not affect meaning,
         /honndy          [honn
   Finally, the glottal stop does occur as an autonomous phoneme
in two demonstratives, /ya?4/ ‘this one here’ and /ma?a/ ‘that one
there,’ and their derivatives.’
Nasalization
   Nasalization is the realization of two morphemes:                  one occurs
word-finally; the other occurs word-medially.’ — The word-final
nasalization morpheme is a phrase-terminal marker, used when the
other phrase-terminal marker, which deletes final unaccented
vowels, would cause difficulty in comprehension. This phrase-
terminal marker has, in the speech of some elderly persons, the
allophones [w] after /o/, [h] after /a/, and [y] after /i/.

In this work, words such as [akkghili:¢] are written phonetically
(akkghili:e, not akkambhili:c), in order not to confuse them with
those words      which    have    a_ nasal-fricative cluster in a
monomorphemic item, such as /asmhat/, pronounced [a.s4m.hat],
meaning ‘it [beans or rice] was overcooked,’ which is never
pronounced with a nasal yowel.
Accents
  Koasati has three pitch accents:.the low, [~], high, [“], and high
rising-falling, [“]. In addition, there is a mid level of pitch that is
unmarked in this work. If the pitch levels are arbitrarily assigned
the numbers 1 through 7, the low level pitch accent would be 1, the
mid level pitch accent would be 3, the high level pitch accent would
be 5, and the high-rising-falling pitch accent would be 6-7-6. The
following are examples of the various pitches.
   All the pitch accents in verbal forms are morphologically
motivated. The high and low accents are induced by the indicative
form of the verb. Most verbs take the high accent in the indicative;
                                                                  The
only a few take the low, and these verbs may be archaic forms.
                                                                     n-
aorist form induces only a high accent, while the h-grade and
                                                                  high
grade seem to follow the indicative. The intensive induces the
                                                                     of
rising-falling accent. For further discussion and exemplification
these terms see the discussion on internal changes below.
   Pitch accent in nominal forms is lexical in nature. Every noun
must have an accented syllable. The vast majority of root (i.e.,
underived) nouns haye regular accentuation based on the shape of
                                                                   has
the penultimate syllable of the word; if the penultimate syllable
a long vowel, that syllable bears          the accent; if the penultimate
syllable does not have a long vowel then the ultima bears the
accent.   Of the few exceptions, the most notable are a:po
‘grandmother’ (instead of *apo) and hini ‘road’ (instead of *hinf).
The high pitch accent is the only one that can occur on root nouns.
Allotones
   Koasati pitches vary depending on their position in a word.            A
mid pitchin initial position, if followed-by at least one other mid
syllable, will be lowered from 3 to 2.

Alabama, Lupardus 1982:53-54; Creek, Haas 1977:196), has not
been noticed in Koasati.

Consonant Clusters
   Most consonant clusters in Koasati have two members. Three-
member clusters are very rare, and most are the result of the h-
grade (see chap. 9).? Table 2.2 illustrates the possible consonant
clusters to be found and gives-an-example of each.                 In the list,
morpheme boundaries are not indicated; some clusters occur only
across morpheme boundaries, although every effort was made to
find clusters in monomorphemic words. Items glossed as infinitives
are actually third-person indicative forms followed by a switch-
reference suffix, as the verbal noun (see chap. 7) is often irregular.

Restrictions on Occurrence
        The only generalization that can be made concerning the
restrictions on occurrence of consonant clusters is that resonants,
with the exception of //, are less likely to occur as members of a
consonant cluster. Because of assimilations, certain clusters with /1/
as fi
plide /y/ as the final member of a cluster is equally rare.
Vowel Clusters
  Among the Muskogean languages, vowel clusters are unique to
Koasati. In other Muskogean languages, and in possessive and
most stative verb constructions in Koasati, metathesis and vowel
deletion eliminate vowel clusters. However, constructions with
locative prefixesor with transitive negative verbs of class 1A with
pronoun objects do not undergo those processes, and vowel clusters
result. All vowel clusters are phonetically separated by a glottal
stop, although occasionally a glide transition can be heard. Table
2.3 lists all vowel clusters and gives examples of each.

Restrictions on Occurrence
       Only those vowel clusters that begin with /a:/ or /i:/ are of any
frequency. Of vowel clusters beginning with /o/ or /o;/, only /oi/
occurs often. These limitations are due to the distribution of vowels
as the final members of locative and direct object prefixes, and as
the initial segments of verbs.
Syllable Canon
   The syllable shape for monomorphemic words in Koasati is quite
rigid. Syllables in Koasati are either light, consisting of a CV string,
or heavy, consisting of CVC. All words must end in a light syllable;
they can be divided into two groups depending on whether the
penultimate syllable is light or heavy.

V.CV.CV and CV.CV.CV.           The rule of syncope worked from the
beginning of a word, deleting the vowel of every second syllable,
except that in the ultimate syllable. Examples of this rule are found
in ipté ‘squirrel,’ from *ifato, and in doublets such as yalobafyalba
‘tadpole’ and 1iliké/tilko ‘wheat.’
     In words of three syllables or longer in which the initial syllable
is of the shape V or VC, apheresis can take place, in which only the
yowel, or the vowel and consonant both are deleted. Thus doublets
occur such as ataffojtaffé ‘grasshopper’ and iccommt commit ‘anus.’

B. Words with a heavy syllable preceding a heavy penultimate
     syllable
  Words of this shape, if not old compounds, have probably been
produced by the rule of syncope from words of the first class of the
shape (C)V.CV.CV.CV.CV.         For example, the verb //ponha:lo//
seems to originate from an original form *ponahakalo, with the
contraction of the sequence ak to a: before the resonant i, another
obsolete rule.
   Words of this shape with a preceding light syllable are almost all
compounds historically. Note that when the preceding light syllable
is only a vowel, the vowel is either a- or i-, respectively the general
 —         prefix, and the obsolete third person possessive/stative
 prefix.

III. Other Syllable Canons
  Words of other   syllable patterns than those described above are
derived from those patterns as the result of compounding or the
rule of syncope. Words containing a heavy syllable preceding a
light antepenultimate syllable: seem primarily tobe compounds; for
example, //nokhayoli// ‘to drool’ contains the locative prefix nok-
‘action in the throat,’ //coshinaba// ‘to suffer a stunning blow to the
chest’ contains the verb //hinaba// ‘to be hard,’ and //icoktakali// ‘to
open one’s mouth’ contains the obsolete prefixes i- ‘third person’
and cok- ‘mouth.’

                                        (no other examples)
B. Alternate heavy and light syllables
  These words seem in part to have arisen from   syncope of words
of the syllable shape CV.CV.CV.CVC.CV.         This is shown by
 doublets such as //hayatanatka// and //haytanatka// ‘to turn.’ Other
 words are compounds historically, such as cokpacé:ba ‘thousand,’
cokpi  ‘hundred,’ and acdé:ba ‘old.’
                                                          something [sg subj]'
C. Alternate light and heavy syllables
   This canon as well seems to have resulted from compounding;
//obakhitipli// ‘to go backward’ is clearly related to oba:li ‘back’; and
/fobaksolohka// ‘to have thin legs’ is related to obi ‘thigh’ and
//solohka// ‘to be dry [pl subj].’

                                      (no other certain cxamples)
   From time to time other syllable canons may be found in
apparently monomorphemic Koasati words; however, on inspection
they all can be derived by syncope, compounding, or apheresis.
Regressive and Progressive Vowel Deletion
    Regressive vowel deletion occurs when two words come together
across a morpheme boundary; the final vowel of the initial word is
deleted by the initial segment of the second.

                                          Stand’
   Progressive vowel deletion takes place when ca-set pronominal
prefixes are used to possess nouns or inflect stative verbs that begin
with weak i.                                                                                !

Ici-{      J ibfzyan/    ""to have a                {ci-bary/          “You have a           |

fko-/ _ /ithé&sin/       ‘to forget’               fKo-ihé-sit/       “We forgot it,’
There are two environments in which consonants are deleted in
compounding. First, if the initial word ends in a geminate cluster,
the geminate cluster is degeminated. Second, if the initial word
ends in a cluster, the initial member of which is a glottal (/h/, /?/,
ff), and the final word begins with a consonant, the glottal
consonant is lost.
Ca-set Prefix Alteration
     When the ca-set of pronominal prefixes is added to indicate the
possession of a noun—to indicate the direct object or to indicate
the stative subject of a word beginning with the vowels @ or o—the
prefixes are changed to the following: ca- becomes ac-; ci- becomes
aci-, ko- becomes ako-; and haci- becomes ahaci-. The changed
form ac- is prefixed to the vowel, but the other forms follow the
rule of progressive vowel deletion.

Apocopation
     All verbs that end in the classifying suffix i, along with a few
other verbs and verbal suffixes, will lose {i (or Jacking that element,
the final vowel of the verb), before one of the following suffixes:
-t                       connective
-toho-                   realis
 -toha-                  emphatic realis
 -tik                    but
            There      are     only      four    apocopating

nasal consonant assimilates to the point of articulation of the
suffixes beginning with ¢.

However, if the root ends in a nasal and the suffix is -Vheo or -Vhei,
the nasal, is eliminated entirely, as in examples 6 and 8          The
suffixes -Viico and -Vici, when following a conson ant other than a
nasal, are reduced to -co and -ci, as in example 4. Another
                                                             rule
apocopation permits the collapse of the sequence -Vhcok émmi- of
-Vicommi-, as in the following examples.                      to
    / naksé&n yomahlihcémmitg /
    “Wheresocver they were going about. . .’
This rule is applied most frequently in rapid speech; it is less
common than the previously illustrated rule of apocopation but, like
it, is completely optional.
Initial Syllable Deletion
  An initial syllable of a trisyllabic or polysyllabic word may be
deleted optionally, if that syllable consists of a short vowel, a short
vowel and consonant, or a CVC sequence. The number of words
to which this rule may apply varies greatly from speaker to speaker,
but most commonly the initial syllables of akkémmin ‘to be so,’
naksammin ‘to be how’ (see example 9 above), and the sequence
itt- at the beginning of most words are deleted.

 various verb classes is extremely complex and is not well understood
 at the present. A full description of the origins of the verb classes
 is beyond the scope of this work. Where it is deemed necessary,
 historical matter will be included to aid comprehension, but no
 complete diachronic description of the classes will be undertaken.
    Each verbal class will be described separately, so far as possible.
 At the beginning of each description will be given a skeleton outline
 of the affirmative and negative subject cross-reference markers,
 followed by a table of inflected examples. The tables will not
 include an entry for the third person plural, as the third person
 form is used indifferently for singular or plural cross-reference. The
prefix he-/oh-, considered by Haas and others to mark the third
person plural, is actually a distributive and indefinite prefix. It is
discussed along with the other verbal prefixes in chapter 4. In
addition to the subject cross-reference markers, the verbal noun will
be given in the tables for each verb that forms one, as the verbal
noun forms an essential part of the verb paradigm. The verbal
nouns,     along   with   the   agentive   nouns,   which,   because   of their
multiplicity will not be given in the tables, will be discussed fully in
chapter 7. Finally, a list of verbs belonging to closed classes with a
small number of members will be given.
Class 1A
   This is the only class in the first conjugati  on that was discussed by
Haas. However, with the       discovery   of class 1B it is now one of two
classes in the first conjugation.    Class   1A is typified by prefixing its
Subject cross-reference markers.           The negative subject cross-
reference markers are also prefixed; additionally the negative
complement -9 is suffixed.* The roots that make up this class all
have the syllable structure CVCV or iCV. However, not all verbs
with this syllable pattern belong to this class; wa:cin ‘to wait for’ is
  ma ‘that,’ yé:fa ‘that (nearby); there,’ and méfa ‘that there; over
                                                                      there.’ To further
  complicate the situation, the verbs ynmin ‘io be so’ (the aspirate
                                                                        d form of

  is yahhémmin—see chap, 9, Obsolete Internal Changes) and maémmin ‘to

        8.    There is one noun that has a phonemic nasal vowel, hghkd
                                                                                     ‘monster that
 cats bad children.’ This, however, could  be an nominatization of a h-grade form.
 Although there is at present no verb *hahkan, it can be compare
                                                                    d to the verbs
 hahkéecin ‘to pant’ and hihkan “to bellow; to roar.’
        9. The only other three-member consonant clusters occur in Indian personal
 Rames, as in the woman's   name  folayhki and  the men’s names  apolayhci and
 Satowayhki. Indian personal names do not carry any meaning, and
                                                                  many scem to
 have        becn borrowed from other Indian languages.            Haas (n.d.b) states that the
 woman's name imikahki is from Creek, and the woman's name tantana
                                                                   seems to
 be borrowed from Biloxi tgntgna ‘Ancient of Panthers.’
    10, On the underlying level, these forms are actually three-member
                                                                       consonant                       {

 of the cluster is dropped. See chap, 9 for a discussion of the h-grade,

  16,        The presence of the cluster /ss/        can be recovered by asking for the
possessed form of the  noun.   Because /ss/ is the  result, in initial position, of the
instrumental prefix s- occurring before an s-initial word, the possessi

Class 1B
  This subclass of the first conjugation was not discussed by Haas
in her 1946 article, although a partial paradigm of one member
appeared in her 1944 article, “Men’s and Women’s Speech in
Koasati.” Class IB is a closed-class of verbs, and one which is
slowly disappearing, as its members switch their membership to
other classes,""* primarily classes 2Ai and 3Cii. Paradoxically, the
three root stative verbs of this class show no sign of switching
conjugations; however, of the active verbs, only three can be fully
inflected      in the     class   1B    pattern,     and     none   are   habitually   so
inflected. Verbs of this class are typified by the infixation of their
subject cross-reference markers, which are almost identical to the
prefixes of class 1A in the affirmative, lacking only initial vowels.
In the negative,          however,     the root has been            reshaped,   and the
infixes are those of class 2C.

   The three active verbs that can take this paradigm are cé;pan ‘to

6:tin ‘to kindle.’

    formed with class JB subject cross-reference markers. These are

    Many other verbs form their verbal nouns according to the class 1B
    pattern; they will be discussed in the section of this chapter on
    verbal irregularity.
    Class 2A
      This verb class is made up of two unequal subclasses. Class 2Ai
    is a closed class of verbs with approximately sixty members; class
Class 2Ai
   This class, although historically formed by analogy with verbs of
class 2Aii, is discussed first to continue the parallelism of this
discussion with that of Haas (1946). Probably all the verbs now in
this class were once members of other verb classes (most probably
1A or 1B): they are either loans from other Indian languages, such
as hopé:nin ‘to cook,’ stalpi:san ‘to be enough,’ hé:tin ‘to cook by
boiling,’ and kosé:pin ‘to pray; to beg’ (from Chickasaw hopo:ni and
atpi?saand Creek hotita and mi:kosapita, respectively), or they are
yerbalized nouns, which for reasons as yet unclear, are inflected as
members of this class rather than the more usual 3Ci,

   Unlike those of all other classes, the verbal nouns of this class
cannot be produced by rule, because many, if not all, verbs of this
class were originally members of other verb classes, and these
recruited verbs tend to retain the verbal noun typical of their
original class.        Thus the verbal noun of bannan ‘to want; to need,’
balinné ‘need,’ has the form of a yerbal noun of class 2C, and that
of 6:tan ‘to arrive there,” is onté ‘arriving there,’ in the form of a
class 1B verbal noun. Some verbs, in analogy with verbs of class
2Aii, delete the final vowel of the root and suffix -ka, while others
base their verbal noun on the first person plural form, in analogy to
the general rule of verbal noun formation in the language (see
chap. 7 for further discussion of verbal nouns).
        The following list contains slightly fewer than half the verbs
found in class 2Ai.

      o:té;ban           ‘to dream’ (ca-stative)
Class 2Aii
   In the forms of its inflectional suffixes, this class is identical to
class 2Ai. However, all verbs in this class end, either overtly or
underlyingly, in the clement li, which is deleted by the subject
cross-reference suffixes. In other Muskogean languages, verbs with
the element -/i or with reflexes of this element are gencrally
transitive, so -/i has been considered to be an clement marking
transitivity.      However, -/i or its reflexes are always overt in these
languages (Creek,”! Choctaw, Mikasuki), while in Koasati, -fi is
almost never overt except in the first person singular affirmative
and the third person affirmative, and then only in the latter case
when certain elisive verbal suffixes are not present,               And, although
the majority of verbs terminating in -li are transitive, many others
are not, such as caydhlin ‘to walk,’ ciléffin ‘to limp,’ cofétlin ‘to
jump,’ niflin ‘to nod,’ tammin ‘to fall,’ misiplin ‘to close the eyes,’
icoktaka:lin ‘to open the mouth,’ etc. The only thing that -li
invariably indicates in Koasati is that the subject cross-reference
suffixes have to be of a certain set.           Therefore, in this work, -ff is
considered to be a classifying suffix in the same way that -are, -ere,
and -ire are considered classifying suffixes in Latin.

verbal noun:     X-ka
     The negative subject cross-reference suffixes are of interest, for
the first person plural and the second person forms are identical to
the same forms of class 3A. A comparison with the negative
markers of verbs of classes 2B and 2C shows that the negative
paradigm of class 2A has been strongly influenced by class 3A.

      If the consonant preceding the class suffix -li is a fricative or
resonant with bilabial or dental articulation, or is the voiced labial
b, the / of the class suffix assimilates to the point of articulation of
the preceding consonant. For example: si#-li-7,/ti#tin/, ‘to push
something’; sif-li-n, /siffin/, ‘to buck’; tafilam-li-n, /tafilammin/, ‘to
overturn [once]’; fob-li-n, /tGbbin/, ‘to hole something many times’;
and kéw-li-n, /kawwin/, ‘to snap many things.’ The class suffix -/i
can also follow /, as in tafil-li-n, /tafillin/, ‘to overturn [many times].’
However, not all verbs terminating in the sequence -/i are members
of class 2A (such as illin ‘to die,’ class 1A; hasikillin ‘to be on
tiptoes,’ class 3Ci).
Class 2B
  This open class of verbs is composed of the compulsives and
multiplicatives of verbs from classes 2Aii and 3A. Class 2B is
derived by suffixing the root-forming suffix -ci, which has a
compulsive signification with same verbs and a multiplicative with
others, and by changing the class suffix, where applicable, from -ka
to -li,     About 275 members           of this class were recorded, but it is

  The affirmative cross-reference markers are clearly those of a
verb of class 2A, however, the suffix -ci (the vowel length is
induced by the indicative internal change, q.v.), rather than
preceding the markers, follows them. The negative cross-reference
markers, on the other hand, are quite different from those of class
2A, partly because the negative complement Q, instead of fusing
with the negative markers, as in verbs of class 2A, follows the
compulsive/multiplicative suffix. The other differences seem to be
the result of the preservation of the negative markers of an earlier
form of class 2A, partly by being protected by the suffix -:ci and
partly by the divorce of the verbs to which this suffix is added from
the morphological and semantic closeness that class 3A manifests
toward class 2Aii.
    Class 2B is the only class that consistently distinguishes between
the concrete and abstract verbal noun, such as those derived from
sikli:cin ‘to saw’: sikkact ‘handsaw' and sikkacd ‘sawing; to saw.’

Class 2C
  This closed class of verbs has more members, over 210, than any
other closed class. It consists of those verbs with a root terminating
in the sequence V,C,C,V., where C,V, is neither -li nor -ka. The
initial consonant of the cluster can consist of any consonant or
vowel length (the reflex of some PM glottal or laryngeal consonant,
the exact nature of which is not known).”* There are no restrictions
on the membership of the consonant cluster, except those language-
wide restrictions on the appearance of certain clusters (see chap. 1).

   The subject cross-reference markers for this class are very similar
to those of class 2B, which reflect the more archaic form of the
suffixes of the second conjugation. The markers of class 2C are yet
more archaic in that the first person plural affirmative marker is ,/i,
(probably related by metathesis to the class 1A prefix for the same
person, #/-) and the first person. singular negative marker is simply
,ka, (again probably related by metathesis to the class 1A marker
ak-),   Haas (1977:531) put forth the idea that the infixes of this
class arose by analogy to the inflection of verbs of classes 2A and
2B; however, analogy does not well explain the variation of the
infixes from the form of the suffixes, especially in the negative. A
better solution is to propose that very early on, probably in the
Proto-Muskogean period, there was a series of suffixed subject
cross-reference markers that were elisive. They deleted the final
vowel of verbs with a final syllable structure of VCV, and deleted
the element -fi from verbs with a final syllable structure VCii.
However, if a verb had a syllable structure terminating in VCCV,
the markers could not be suffixed, as a three-member consonant
cluster would be produced, which was not permissible in the
language, as it is not permissible in modern Koasati. Consonant
cluster simplification would cause serious semantic problems with
either the verb or the suffix.   The solution was to infix the cross-

  Class 3A
      Nearly six hundred members have been noted for this open class
 of verbs. It is made up of three categories of verbs: root 3A
 actives, root 3A statives, and derived 3A mediopassives. This latter
 class, derived mediopassives, is of interest because it is made up of
verbs derived from verbs of class          2Aii—t  ransit  ive     verbs that
 terminate with the classifying suffix -li and    that  form    their derived
mediopassives by transforming the suffix      -fi  into  the   suffix -ka, the
classifying suffix for most verbs of class 3A.               These derived
mediopassives are as a rule impersonal verbs with two primary uses,
First, they are used when the action, usually perceived as being
carried out by an agent, has that agent deleted, so          that   the  action
apparently occurs without the intervention of an agent. Second              ,   a
derived mediopassive is used when the agent of an action             Is seen   to
have lost control over the performance of the action. The followi
                                                                              ng

     assumed to be an intransitive or mediopassive auxiliary; however,
     it is more likely that *ka is an old verb meaning ‘to be,’ which has
     an identical reflex in Apalachee, ka,”’ and also seems to appear in
     the Koasati enclitic katika ‘but it is the case that’ (cf. -tik ‘but’). As
     mentioned above, the close similarity of the negative paradigm of

 paradigm has been reshaped after the 3A pattern.

Class 3B
    This closed class of verbs nevertheléss has a goodly number of
members, almost 275 recorded. It is made up of the compulsives
of verbs that do not belong to classes 2Aii or 3A, nouns verbalized
with -ci, and a few unanalyzable verbs terminating in the element
-ci,

    Verbs of class 2B that end in -ci optionally may be inflected as
members of this class. However, such a transfer of verbs from one
class to another is not common among most adult speakers.
Class. 3C
      This class was not discussed by Haas in her 1946 article.                       The
subject cross-reference markers belonging to class 3C are very
similar to those of classes 3A and 3B, however where class 3A
suffixes frequently begin with / and class 3B suffixes begin with a
vowel, class 3C suffixes begin with ¢. This class consists of two
subclasses, 3Ci and 3Cii.           The latter class only consists of words
verbalized with the emphatic and copular suffix -o.
Class 3Ci
    This open class of verbs has only about one hundred                              basic
members. Verbs derived from nouns by the use of internal changes
(see chap. 11) also belong to class 3Ci. The verbs basic to this class
are generally trisyllabic and do not have a classifying suffix. This
  verb for which the speaker has tempor  arily   forgot ten  the  class
  membership. A few verbs in this class are certainly loans,
                                                               such as
 tahpa-lan ‘to invite people,’ a word now obsolete,
                                                    which is derived
  from the Creek word tahpa-la ‘town messenger; town crier,’

   The construction of   the   subjec t   cross- refere nce  marke rs   is even
more reminiscent of a double          verb   constr  uction  linked   with   the
connective suffix -t, This   analys is  is possib le,  howeve r,  only  for the
afirmative, where both root and suffix bear an accent

negative only the suffix bears the accent for the word.
   In the following table note  that for the verbal ized noun, the
indicative form is not used, but rather the aorist
                                                   ,” because such

   As can be seen, the subject cross-reference suffixes are identic
to the affirmative suffixes of class                                al
                                     3Ci with the additi on  of  -o in the
affirmative and -é-kkg in the negati ve.  The paucal  and   plural
are derived from the paradigm for nouns that take                   forms
                                                              those two

Auxiliary Verbs
   There are a number of verbs that, when they occur in conjunction
with other verbs, have different meanings than when they are used
independently. These are termed auxiliary verbs, of which there are
 two kinds, regular auxiliaries and sporadic auxilaries.
 Statityan                     ‘to continue’                     ‘to be taking’
 ané&lin (sg)                  “to finish [trans]'               ‘to use up; to devour’
 an6:kan (sg) anoskan (pl)     ‘to finish {intrans]’             ‘to be used up’
 &:tan (sg)     f:san (pl)     ‘to keep on; 10 continue’         ‘to dwell’
 faylin (sg) faydhlin (pl) —_ ‘to quit; to stop [trans}’         ‘to leave off
 faykan (sg) faydhkan (pl)     ‘to quit; to stop [intrans]'      ‘to be cnded’
émmin                          ‘to be the case that [trans]'     ‘to be [trans]’
énkan                          ‘to be the case that [intrans]'   ‘to be [intrans]'
   In contrast with other Muskogean languages verbs of position,
such as sitting or standing, are not used as regular auxiliaries
(Booker 1980:207-9),      Furthermore, there are three pairs of
auxiliaries that mark not only the singularity or plurality of the verb
to which they are connected, but also its transitivity. The coding of
transitivity on auxiliaries does not occur in any other Muskogean
language except Alabama.
ati:yan ‘to become; to go on’
     With intransitive verbs, ati:yan is used to mean ‘to become.”
With transitive verbs, it means ‘to go on.’ The following examples
show both uses of this auxiliary.
9)    itt6 hissi-k la:na-t atiry

      “He kept on wandering about; he must have pone and worked, and he came

  The use of aff:yanin the sense of ‘become’ is restricted to verbs.
When one noun is transformed into another noun, the verb
anahkan™ js used, as in the following examples.

ané:lin    | andslin | ané:kan | anéskan ‘to finish’
   These four verbs are in extremely common use as auxiliaries—far
more than as independent verbs. These verbs are used to indicate
that the actions of the verbs they modify have been completely
carried out to their conclusions.

        ‘When they are full grown, they, too, in the same way fly looking for things
        and cat them.’
      The intransitive plural auxiliary andéskan does not always occur
where expected, as in example 14, perhaps due to a feeling that
plurality in an intransitive auxiliary is not an especially significant
 feature.

      This is probably the most common paired set of auxiliary verbs.
In the Muskogean languages of Florida, Seminole Creek (Nathan
1977:109-10), and Mikasuki                  (Boynton        1982:86-88),* cognate
elements have fused with the verbs to which they once formed
auxiliaries; however, in Koasati they are still independent verbs.
omenin
      This auxiliary, the transitive form of the verb ‘to be,’ is used with
both transitive and intransitive verbs. It can either be coordinate
with the main verb of the sentence, which then takes the suffix -&
or it can dominate the entire sentence, the verb of which takes the
suffix -n. This process is clearly an ¢laboration on the switch-
reference marking system used to relate sentences to one another.
   When émmin is coordinate with the verb of the sentence, it
generally has a progressive meaning. However, énunin differs from
the progressive suffix -Vhci in meaning, since the latter does not
imply a termination to the action to which it refers, while émunin
does.      When 6mmin occurs after the suffix string -Vico-k it often
fuses with the string to form -Vhcémmin.               When 6mmin dominates
a sentence,        it indicates      the   action   is an    example   of what   is
happening; it is best rendered in English by ‘it is the case that.’

        ‘Bul this being so, we were going on, too much, as can be surmised, in
         habitual difficulties.’
      The verb 6mmin also occurs connected to a previous verb with
the suffix       -f. This is, however, not an auxiliary construction, but a
coordinate expression, as in the following example.

                   ‘to want something’ have been noted.              Like 6mmin,
 énkan can be coordinate with or dominant to a phrase, with the
 same switch-reference marking on the verb with which it is
 associated, The meanings of this auxiliary seem to be similar to
 those of démumin,

   The use of énkan as an auxiliary verb must be kept distinct from
its use in sentences where it defines the category of an object.

introducing quoted speech, and as such is glossed quori in this
work.
Sporadic Auxiliaries
   A few verbs, most of them rare, require as auxiliaries other verbs
than those discussed above.          Unlike regular auxilaries, these
sporadic auxiliaries are obligatory; however, a choice of several

Defective Verbs
      Defective yerbs are those verbs which have some lack in their
conjugation. There are only two verbs which can be considered
defective in this manner: -Vilin ‘to be a,’ and ankan / cinkan /
inkan {| konkan | hacinkan | ilinkan | ittinkan ‘to give.
-Vilin ‘to be a?
      This ca-stative verb of class 2Aii is defective; not only does it lack
a third person form anda verbal noun (they are supplied from the
conjugation of the verb émumin), but it also occurs only in the
present indicative (affirmative and negative) and interrogative. It
never occurs with any of the various verbal suffixes,

‘to give’
      In Koasati the verb ‘to give’ is irregular because it has no root.
It is simply composed of a dative prefix, which cross-references the
person to whom something is given, and the classifying suffix -ka,
which indicates that the actor is cross-referenced by the suffixes of
class 3A. This situation has a complex historical origin. The root of
the verb ‘to give’ was originally *a, inflected by means of the
auxiliary ka,” with obligatory dative prefixes. In the language
ancestral to Alabama and Koasati, the syllable canon changed so
that monosyllabic verb roots were unacceptable. The auxiliary *ka
fused with the root and prefixes, which then syncoped (see chap.
2), and the auxiliary was reinterpreted as the classifying suffix -ka.
That process produced the seven separate verbs meaning ‘to give.’
In Alabama, the verb ‘to give’ shows indications of a growing
reanalysis as a root, inka (Sylestine, Hardy, and Montler 1989), as
attested by its inflection (e.g., Albama iniska ‘you give to him,’
Koasati {hisk). Table 3.14 gives the various inflected forms of the
Koasati verbs; table 3.15 shows their historical development.

Trregularity in Inflection
  Two verbs with irregular inflection are discussed here, ké:han ‘to
say something,’ and a:lon ‘to hope, think so, guess.”
Kahan ‘to say’
   This verb is irregular in that its full root only occurs in the first
person singular and the third person; otherwise it appears as ka:,
Historically, this verb seems to have had the form -ka: in all
persons, with phonemic vowel length in final position, a feature that
no longer occurs in the language. When the language ancestral to
Alabama and Koasati changed its syllable canon to reject
monosyllabic verb roots, in Koasati the subject cross-reference
prefixes were reinterpreted as part of the syllable canon; in the first
and third persons, lacking such prefixes, the a: of the root broke to
become aha in accordance with a rule that a long vowel may
become a VhV sequence.           Finally, the vowel-deleting phrase-

verbal noun:           ilka
&:lon ‘to hope’
  This verb is irregular in the inflection of the second person,
where an excrescent s appears in both the affirmative and negative
conjugations.                 In the following inflectional paradigm for this verb,
excrescent § is italicized.

verb, azlotilka.
   The impersonal verb *alf:lan—which means ‘to be good’ in the
sense of something which is approved and which may be related to
é:lon—is irregular in that it forms no negative and appears only in
stereotypical formulae such as alf;io ‘good enough!’ alf:la:sg “quite
good!’ and alf:lamé ‘thank you!” (literally ‘good indeed!’),
Trregularity in Derivation
   A few verbal nouns have irregular derivation because they
cannot, as. most verbal nouns, be predicted from the first person
plural form of the verb. The verbs from which they are derived
have switched classes, and the verbal noun is formed on the first
person plural form of the verb’s former class. The vast majority of
irregular verbal nouns are formed after the pattern of class 1B, a
class that is disappearing (see above). A few verbal nouns are
double marked; that is, instead of manifesting one derivational
morpheme they manifest two, in two cases markers of different
classes. The following table lists these irregular verbal nouns.

                                        Notes
    1, The description of verb conjugation in Alabama is complicated by the fact
that Lupardus has analyzed it in terms of the Proto-Muskogean forms from which
the Alabama subject cross-reference markers are descended. Therefore, it is very
difficult to compare the forms she gives with comparable Koasati forms. Montler
and Hardy (1989) provide a much more accessible description.
    2. In descriptions of other Muskogean languages, especially Choctaw, the
ncgative morpheme has been described as a discontinuous morpheme, ik... 0.
However, as the / in ik is almost certainly historically derived from a third person
pronoun prefix, and the o {at least in Koasati) can be deleted by a number of
vowel-initial verbal suffixes, the basic negative morphome must bek. The negative
complement      -o occurs independently only with those negative subject cross-
reference markers thal are prefixed or infixed. It has fused with suffixed ncgative
cross-reference markers, When the negative complement (independent or fused)
occurs in phrase-final position, it takes         the vowel nasalizing phrase-terminal
marker, For greater graphic simplicity in the tables, this phrase-terminal marker
is not sct off morphemically.
   3.     The appearance of the vowel deleting phrase-terminal marker may have
caused i:sin to change classes. Because of consonant cluster assimilations, three
of the paradigmatic forms would have become almost identical; the second person
singular *is (from is-s), the third person singular is, and the first person plural *is
(from ii-s, with ls becoming ss), At      present, Koasati tolerates only two similar
forms in one paradigm, as i:/ ‘he arrives’ if ‘we arrive’ (from i/-!),
    4, The verbal noun is accented on the penultimate syllable when that syllable
has inherent vowel Icngth, as in halon (from Proto-Muskogean *haklo).
    5. The root form given is the third person form of the verb with the indicative
internal change, followed by the switch-reference marker -n. The infinitive gloss is
more appropriate to the verbal noun, one of the uses of which is as an infinitive.
instrumental prefixes maintain their subject cross-reference prefixes in the position
immediately before the verb root, so that the prefixes precede the inflectional
morphology.      Thus:    cassén ona-i:pa-l-4 ‘I am going to cat corn off the cob’;
negative form, cassén ona-ak-p-G.
   10. This verb, like other verbs of motion, has a third person non-singular suffix,
-ci, In verbs with a singular/dual root and a suppletive plural, -ci suffixed to the
singular/dual root signifies third person dual; with other verbs it signifies third
person plural.
   LL. This verb literally means ‘to arrive for someone.’ The segment im- is the
dative prefix, and it changes to agree with the number of the person to whom the
baby will be born,
    12. This verb is derived with the instrumeatal prefix st- and the reflexive prefix
ili- from the verb n&ion, and literally means ‘to use something on onescl£.’ Note:
stilsisn&zh ‘you rub medicine on yourself; stil-ak-n&hg ‘Ido not rub medicine on
myself.”
  13. ‘This verb is most frequently inflected after the class 3Ci pattern.    Its class
1A pattern is irregular: ca-lihd:t ‘T awaken’; ca-L,ik,h&l-g ‘I do not awaken,’ which
seems. to indicate that the element ifi- is the reflexive prefix.
   14. In Alabama, on the other hand (Sylestine, Hardy, and Montler 1989), verbs
of a class parallel to Koasati’s 1B are not uncommon; the majority are fully
conjugated according to their Alabama pattern. Verbs of this Alabama class
include 4a “to stay; to be located,’ aca:pa ‘to object to,’ ahozba ‘to tic with
someone,’ atozba ‘to take someone's place,’ aya:bi ‘to be greedy about something,”
oko:ci “to draw water,"" o:ti ‘to kindle,’ and so forth.
   15. The semicolon (;) marks both vowel length (:) and location of infixing (,).
   16. The verb stafizyan ‘to be taking,’ derived from atiyan, also has a verbal
noun of 1B form, stanfi:ya, which is used to mean “transportation.”
   17. The verb é&fan is one of the verbs of motion which takes the third person
non-singular suffix -ci. As the suffix falls between the third person negative subject
cross-reference marker and the negative complement, the original form of the
negative marker for class 2A is thereby revealed.
   18. The verb. bannan      and the verb Kanan   ‘to be well, good’ have two negative
paradigms.     The class 2A negative paradigm for bannan, bankg, means ‘not to
want’; for k&non, kinkg ‘to be morally bad’; the class 3Ci negative paradigm for
bimnan,     bannatikkg,   means ‘not to need,’ and for ké&non, ka:notikkg       “to be
unwell.’
   19.     The verbs é&san    ‘to cradle in the arms’ and &san       ‘to be with’ are
homophonous. This may not have been the casc historically, however, as Mikasuki
has.a cognate for the first verb, a:fa ‘to cradle in the arms,’ pointing to a possible
                                                                          or is
  21. In Creek,    Proto-Muskogean *-/i has the reflex y intervocalically
                                                                     7), in her
assimilated completely to a preceding consonant. Nathan (1977:2  account for the
description of Seminole Creek, sets up a rule of y epenthesis to
                                                                   this rule may be
relationship between -y- and -k- in verbs, However appropriate
synchronically, it is diachronically wrong,
                                                                 that in the Proto-

                                                               simply that such an
Muskogean period -/i did not indicate a transitive verb, It is
analysis is not synchronically valid for Koasati.
                                                                            Hitchiti

Vulture, who. has just finished “doctoring” Rabbit by killing and eating him,
ironically uses the term to refer to the taste of his flesh. Bear, who has been

well again.

   38 The verbal noun alyokea          is found only in the compound          taki alyokcé

meaning of ayékcin has shifted to ‘to beget; to engender children,’ and it forms a
regular verbal noun, ayokeiiké.
Outline of Verbal Prefixes
  A verb stem is preceded by nine rigidly fixed slots that can be
filled by verbal prefixes. These prefixes cover the semantic areas
of pronominal object and indirect object, location, distribution,
instrument, and direction, In addition, the distributive is being
extended to cover the passive, and the instrumental prefix is being
used to derive transitive verbs. Below is a brief catalog of the
prefix positions and the items that occur in them, followed by a
fuller description and examples of each (see table 4.1 for a graphic
depiction of these slots).
Position 1
  These prefixes are simply the subject cross-reference prefixes,
both positive and negative, of verbs of class 1A.
Position 2
   Position 2 contains only two prefixes. The one is the general
jocative prefix @-, which is falling into disuse, having been replaced
in most cases by one or another of the specific locative prefixes.
The other is the prefix ak-, which indicates action on the skin or
                                                                    111
a vertical surface or in a vertical plane,’ ita- ‘action in the middle
of something,’ ibi:- ‘action on the human face,’ ico:- ‘action on or in
the human mouth,’ no:- ‘action on the human neck,’ and nok-
‘action in the human throat.’ Originally there were four other
prefixes in this position: ac- ‘motion outward,’ cok- ‘motion inward,’
ako- ‘motion downward,’ and ono(n)- ‘motion upward.’ These
prefixes are at present limited to a very few verbs of motion, and
are not freely used.
Position 4
  Position 4 is filled by the ca-set of pronominal prefixes, which
cross-reference direct objects of transitive verbs, subjects of ca-
Stative verbs, and the possessors of any object that can be inherently
possessed.
Position 5
  Position 5 is filled by the am-set of pronominal prefixes, which
cross-reference indirect objects of transitive verbs (or, rarely, direct
objects), benefactives (and malefactives), subjects of am-stative
verbs, and possessors of any alienable object.
Position 6
   The distributive prefix ho-/oh- and the iterative prefix hoho-/ohoh-
occur in this position. In addition to its use as a distributive, the
prefix ho-/oh- is used to mark indefinite actor, adjective plurality,
and to derive the passive.

prefix mas-/mast- indicates that the object with which the action is
done is full or solid and is at a distance from the speaker; mas-/
mast- contrasts with mat-.
Position 8
   Position 8 is filled by the directional prefixes oht-/oh-/o- ‘to go
and do something’ and £ét-/it-/i- ‘to come and do something,’ The
latter prefix has the secondary function of deriving agentive nouns
of location from verbal nouns.
Position 9
   Position 9 js filled by the incorporated indefinite nouns na:si-
/na:s-/nas- ‘something’ and a:ti-/a:t-/at-/a- ‘someone.’
Prefix Position 1
   This slot is filled by the following subject cross-reference prefixes
of verbs of class 1A:

     Is             Bs        ak-

    pe      locative’
This prefix, unlike its widely used cognates in other Muskogean
languages, does not frequently occur alone; it usually forms a
complex with the specific locative prefix on- and appears as ona-.
The semantics of the prefix are very general and only indicate that
the action is taking place at or near something, Frequently a- has
a derivational, rather than locative force; see table 20.3 for
examples.

place to, from, or on the ground, as in the follo

A number of words having reference to water begin with ok-;
however, they all seem to be formed by compounding with ok?.

   The prefix pa:- has in some cases been Iexicalized in combination
with a verb to form a unit with different semantics than the
components. Therefore, for example, the singular /dual/plural verb
complex, cokké:lin | cikkt:kan / t:san ‘to sit,’ with the prefix pa:-
(pa:cokké.lin | paicikki:kan | pa;t:san) means not only ‘to sit on
something’ but also ‘to ride horseback’ and, secondarily, ‘to ride in
any kind of vehicle.’          The same verb complex, when used in
reference to birds, means ‘to perch.’ Additionally, the verbal nouns
of the singular and plural members have the following concrete
meanings: pa:cokko:ka ‘chair; saddle’ and pazistilka ‘perch.
  A secondary meaning of the prefix pa:- is ‘on the human back.’

      The n of the prefix assimilates in position to a following stop and,
preceding a fricative, disappears and nasalizes the preceding vowel,
as in examples 23, 27, and 28.

As the changed set of ca-prefixes elide the initial vowel of this
prefix, it is possible, in fricative-initial words, for the prefix to be
reduced to nasalization of the vowel of the changed prefix, as in the
following:

      There seems to be no noun related to the prefix on-; however, it
has      a   cognate       in   the   Mikasuki   prefix   on-   (Derrick-Mescua

Because of the restricted meaning of ifta-, there seems to be no
conflict with the homophonous prefix i#ta-, ‘action on the ground or
in fire.’ [tta-‘in the middle of has no related noun.
ibi:- ‘action on the human face’
      This prefix indicates that the action is taking place on the human
face or, more rarely, an animal’s face or the metaphorical face of
an object.

The initial vowel of ibi:- is elided by the vowel of a preceding ca-
set prefix. This prefix is related to the noun ibita:la ‘face’ as well as
to    ibisa:ni ‘nose’ and ibitkani ‘nasal mucus.’
ico:- ‘action on the mouth’
   This prefix indicates that the action is taking place on, in, or near
the human mouth or the metaphorical mouth of an object.

As with ibi:-, the initial vowel of ico:- is elided by a preceding vowel.
   The closely related unproductive prefix icok- is used with a few
unanalyzable verbs, such as icoktaka:lin (sg), icoktaklin (pl) ‘to open
the mouth,’ and with some nouns, such as icokhiské ‘beard,’
icokpaskaci ‘cheek,’ and icokhaibf ‘mouth.’

      If the action can be viewed as occurring simultaneously on the
exterior and the interior of the throat (as in various types of
beheading), either prefix may be used, as no:-tipdslin/nok-tipdéslin ‘to
tear the head off and no:-koydffin/nok-koyéffin ‘to cut the head
off.’
   The prefixes no;- and nok- are related to the Koasati words né:bi
‘neck’ and nokondé:bi ‘esophagus,’ as well as to Creek nékwa ‘neck’
and Mikasuki nokbi ‘neck.’
The Archaic Motion Prefixes ac-, cok-, ako- and ono(n)-
   These prefixes formerly occurred in position 3, but are now
limited to a very few verbs. The first three prefixes are found
attached to the singular/plural verb pair -hali:ka-/-kahka, which no
longer occurs independently. Table 4.2 lists all the examples so far
noted,

                   on6-:tan              -              ‘to reach up for’
   In the speech of some persons the semantic distinction between
the verbs onghali:kan and onéyyan has become blurred; in such
cases the two paradigms collapse into one, with ondyyan becoming
the singular verb and enonkahkan the plural.
Prefix Position 4
   Prefix positions 4 and 5 are filled by the direct and indirect object
prefixes, which also are used to inflect stative verbs and indicate the
possessor of nominalized verbs. Position 4 is filled by the direct
object prefixes, termed the ca-set of prefixes, after the first person
singular prefix, ca-. These consist of: 1s ca-, 2s ci-, 3 0-, Ip Ko-, and
2p] haci-,      There   is also a reflexive prefix, ili-, and a reciprocal

All /-initial verbal prefixes in position 1 are strong.
Prefix Position 5
   This slot is filled by the dative/benefactive prefixes, termed the
am-set after the first person singular prefix, am-. This set of
prefixes consists of the following: 1s am-, 2s cim-, 3 im-, 1p] kom-,
2pl hacim-, reflexive ilim-, and reciprocal ittim-.        These   prefixes
cross-reference the indirect object of a verb but also cross-reference
an action done to the benefit or detriment of one affected by the
verb.     Additionally, if a possessed noun is the subject, then the
      / cayytk gfitizb /
      ‘L have a cramp in my foot.”

   Two prefixes of position 5 can be used together if the semantics
of an utterance require that both a benefactive and a dative object
be expressed. However, the benefactive takes precedence over the
dative, which can be expressed only by a third person prefix. When
a bencfactive and a dative occur together, the prefix closest to the
stem is dative, and the one furthest from the stem is benefactive.

       there so that I might interpret for her, so that I might tell them things for

   The prefixes of positions 4 and 5 are used to indicate the
possessor of a nominalized verb. The prefixes of position 4 are
identical to those prefixes that indicate inalienable possession (see
chap. 14). Therefore, their use with nominalized verbs is quite rare,
because such verbs usually indicate objects that are alienably
possessed. However, compare example 76 with example 77.

not have a special form to indicate the plural.

      ‘The flowersof the magnolia are also beautiful. They are white and largish.’
   The distributive prefix is also used to indicate that the actor in a
verb phrase is indefinite; it is thus equivalent to the indefinite they
of some English dialects.

      ‘They also looked for a doctor, but were unable {to find one}, and they seat
      him off to a faraway place, to New Orleans.’ (actor unspecified)
   As an indicator of an indefinite actor, the distributive prefix has
come to be used as a way of concealing from the hearer the fact
that the speaker knows the identity of the actor, as in the following.
89)   mié:fa 4swa-n ohayyi ndmpo-to

person) and did not wish to convey the knowledge.
  Finally, in an extension of its indefinite use, the distributive is
used to derive the passive. The passive is not the same as the
intransitive (mediopassive) of verbs of class 2A.                  Only transitive
verbs     of that class can derive            an intransitive     form, while    all
transitive yerbs can, in theory, form a passive.                   The passive is
distinguished from a statement of indefinite action by the fact that
the object of the transitive verb is raised to subject in the presence
of the distributive prefix, and marked with the nominative case
suffix -k, as in the following examples.

Iteratives of any kind are uncommon, and the iterative prefix very
rarely occurs. Koasati prefers to'use a multiple verb construction
(as in example 94), or one with the auxiliary verb a:tan(sg)/f:san(pl)
‘to keep on’ (as in example 95), to cover the semantics of the
iterative. Quantifying adverbs may also be used (as in example 96).

as they are mutually exclusive with 5-/st-, they are classified as
instrumental.
s-{st- “by means of; with’
   This prefix has the phonologically conditioned allomorphs s-
before a consonant-initial word and st- before a vowel-initial word.
Its main use is to indicate that the action of the verb is done with
or by means of some object. This prefix is not used with reference
to humans; if an action is done with or accompanying a person, the
sentence must be constructed using either the verb a:san ‘to be with
someone’ or siékion ‘to be together with someone.”                          In the
following examples s-/st- has an instrumental function.

   Koasati has many verbs that in English could be construed as
tacitly instrumental, but are overtly so in Koasati,. The following are
some of the more important examples.
                     Verbs Derived with the Instrumental Prefix
       Root          Gloss                  Derived Form       Gloss
       iltGhnon = =— ‘to. work’              stiltéhnon        ‘to use’
       i:lan         ‘to arrive’            stilan             ‘to bring’
       ontin         ‘to come fsg/du}’      —st6ntin           ‘to be bringing”
       éctan         ‘to be there’          sléctan            *to take’
       aticyan       ‘to go [sg/du]’        staticyan          ‘to be taking’”
       fiyan         ‘to go about [sg]’     sta:yan            ‘to carry”
It is notable that the root forms are all intransitive verbs and that
the    derived    forms      are     transitives.       In   the   same     manner,   the
instrumental prefix is used to derive certain verbs of emotion from
others, the derived forms being almost completely transitive,* as in
the following examples.
          ilahollé:cin   = — ‘to mourn’! 10   stimilahollé:cin   ‘to give someone the ereeps'
       Although a number of other verbs of emotion seem to have been
derived with this prefix, simple roots for them seem not to exist,
         Verb                      Gloss
         stimilac’:ban             ‘to be uncooperative with somcone’
         stimpilé:cin              ‘to bother; to annoy somcone’
         stibak#in                ‘to be poor and suffering""!
         stamatahkan              ‘to steal in a raid; to get by guileor trickery’
  The following example shows that the element st- in these verbs
behaves like the instrumental prefix.

         “When it was certain that he was dying, he told people, “Do not bury me

   A rare allomorph of the instrumental prefix before a vowel is s-
rather than sf-. This allomorph has been noted only in siyawépkan,
a Sstative verb meaning ‘to eat avidly’ (first person singular
scayawépk—ef, yawophilkén ‘quickly; rapidly’) and in the noun
sit(ainnahé ‘poker’ (cf. innahé ‘thing to use’ and the locative prefix
itta- ‘in the fire’). This rare allomorph may occur in the verb
siyahkan ‘to whine [of dogs] (cf. yaéhkan ‘to weep; to yelp; to yow!’).
mat-    ‘ala distance’
   The second prefix in position 7 is mat-, the general meaning of
which is ‘afar,’ ‘at a distance,’ or ‘away from a location.’

   Much as the instrumental prefix does, mat- obligatorily occurs
with some verbs as a derivational element. As in the case of the
instrumental, there are a few verbs that occur only with this prefix.
                   Examples of Verbs Derived with the Prefix mat-
        Root          Gloss                  Derived Form      Gloss
        cokkélin      ‘to sit”               matcokkélin       ‘to be out [of the sun]!
        miciksin       ‘to raise the head’    matmiciksin   ‘to raise the head and
                                                            look al something’
        &lan           ‘to make a musical     matimélan     ‘to ring [of one’s ears}?

                        or basket’                           atsomething'
mas-/mast- ‘full; solid; containing something’
  This is the last prefix position 7, and unlike the others it is rather
uncommon. Its primary meaning is to indicate that the object of
the verbal action is full, or solid. To contrast with mias-/mast-,               and
to mean ‘empty or hollow,’ the prefix mrat- is used, as in the
following example.
1084)    sapokd-n mast-dnk
         PACK-obj     full-GIVE:TO:ME(imp)
         fsapokan    mastank/
         ‘Give me the full pack!’
108b)     sapoka-n mat-dnk
          PACK-obj afar-GIVE:TO;ME(imp)
          ‘sapokfn   matdnk/
          ‘Give me the empty pack!”
The following are a few more examples of the use of this prefix.
      mast-Im-asé:ci-n mat-aptil-ok
      full-3dat-PULL:OUT-sw afar-THROW:ss:foc

     ‘The wind took it [the porch] off of her, and she pulled it [her leg] out, and
      it [the wind] threw her about, and...’
  Just like the other two prefixesin this position, mas-/mast- is used
in derivation; however, it derives nouns as often as it does verbs.

such were the case in Koasati, the directional prefixes would have
the forms *o#t- and *ilt-. However, these forms are not found and
the change of # to /and / to vowel length does not occur,
oht-/oh-/o- ‘to go and do something’
  This prefix has three phonologically conditioned allomorphs: oht-
before vowels, oh- before consonants,            and o- before consonant
clusters. As the only consonant clusters that can begin a verb
contain the instrumental prefix, o- occurs only before words
containing that prefix.

   When        nouns     derived    with        this   prefix    are        possessed,        it   is
considered better if the pronoun prefixes occur after the directional
prefix, although forms in which the pronoun prefixes precede the
directional are accepted; thus itaminnocafa ‘in my bedroom’ is
considered preferable to ami:tinnocafaé. For further discussion of
verbal nouns, see chapter 7.

   The process that incorporates these nouns into the verbal phrase
seems to be in some             measure still active, as the location of the
prefix can vary. Although its position in the outermost slot is most
common, it is not unusual for it to occur outside position 5, and
after the directional and instrumental prefixes.”

nazsi-/na:s-/nas- ‘something’
  Na:si- occurs in careful speech, na:s- before vowels, and nas-
before consonants. The prefix signifies that the verbal action
involves something indefinite and non-human, as in the following
examples.

location in time or sequence, and function within a sentence                   or
clause. These suffixes, many without parallel in other Muskogean
languages, sccm to have arisen from the accretion of formerly
independent words onto the verb base. Some, from comparative
evidence,    seem      to   have   arisen    from    the    incorporation      of
independent adverbs; presently such adverbs are very rare.
   With the exception of eleven suffixes, which can only occur alone
or with a severely limited number of additional suffixes, all other
suffixes can co-occur, technically, with all suffixes that do not occupy
the same position after the verb base.” Therefore, the following
conglomeration, though highly unusual, is completely grammatical
and comprehensible:

       ""They say that they all might be able to go and bring it to him, but on the
       contrary, | do not believe them.’
  There are fifteen rigidly ordered positions after the verb base in
which these suffixes can occur, in order from left to right they are:
(1) adverb, (2) diminutive/intensive, (3) habitual, (4) intention, (5)
ability, (6) realis/irrealis, (7) deduction, (8) modality, (9) dubitative,
(10) hearsay, (11) auditory, (12) tense, (13) consequence,                   (14)
discourse functions, and (15) enclitics. Table 4.4 lists the the
suffixes found in each position, Because the vowel-deleting phrase-
terminal marker frequently operates on these suffixes, many have
a different word-final form. which is listed, along with the
apocopated form that a few suffixes have.

  This slot is filled primarily by adverbs of quality or intensity. The
majority of them bear a natural accent, and it is very probable that
they are in origin independent words incorporated into the verb
complex. Below each adverb that can occur in this slot is listed and
exemplified, with discussion where warranted.
the verb suffixed indicates a state or quality, -d:ho:si- means ‘very’;
with an action verb it means ‘almost’ or ‘nearly.’

(Byington 1912:121) and Chickasaw -finna ‘too’ (Munro 1984:339).

  In the following unusual construction, the adverb/diminutive
compound has been incorporated as part of the verb base, as
indicated by the deletion of the accent of the adverb and the
reassignment of the accent to the penultimate syllable of the
compound, as in a root verb.
-mbi:ka-‘a pleasant deal’
   This adverbial suffix indicates that there is an intensity of the
action, but also that the speaker views it as something pleasant or
desirable. This suffix has a Choctaw cognate in the adverb bika
‘always; commonly; usually’ (Byington 1912:88).

magnification of the basic emotional state implied by the verb.

The adverb -V:mo- is very likely related to the sentence particle md,
which has a vague emphatic force (see chap. 20).
-mé:li-      ‘in the same way’
   This rather rare suffix indicates that the action taking place is
similar to one mentioned previously. It has been observed so far
only in texts.

-nadnna-    ‘all the time’
  This is a very common adverbial suffix, one that is frequently
used in deriving verbs from nouns. With verbs -n4nna- means that
the action occurs all the time; with nouns it means that an area is
characterized by the object referred to in the noun.

The suffix -ndnna- has special semantics when used with nouns
referring to body parts, and the verbs derived from it have certain
restrictions on use.

pata:ia           ‘chest’      pata:landnnan         ‘to have one’s shirt unbuttoned’
   These derived verbs are generally used only with verbs of motion,
to describe how someone is going somewhere, as in example 162,
or adverbially, as in examples 163 and 164.                      In addition to the
meaning given above, cofkonindnnan can also mean ‘to be nothing

Suffix Position 2: Diminutive/Intensive
-si-/-o:si-    diminutive/intensive
   The sole occupant of this slot is the diminutive and intensive
suffix -:si-/-o:si-. The allomorphs are phonologically governed: -:si-
occurs after the vowels o and a; -o:si- appears after the vowel i,
which is elided. The suffix -:si-/-o:si- has a cognate in the Mikasuki
intensive suffix -os- (Boynton 1982:97).           This morpheme is
polysemous; on the one hand it indicates that the action of the verb
is less intense than it usually is; on the other it can mean that the
action of the verb is taking place to its fullest extent. The following
examples show the use of this suffix as a diminutive.

  Occasionally this suffix refuses the allomorph -o;si- after i. In
most of those cases, as in the following example, the i preceding the
suffix is part of the sequence -ci, which is either historically or
synchronically the complusive/multiplicative suffix.
         ‘They used to say that at Mardi Gras time, the Catholics really fast.’
   The suffix -si-/-o:si-,      in addition to its diminutive and intensive
functions, has a few rarer uses. At times it seems to mean “merely,”
as in the following:

         ‘She is merely one-half her twin is deceased; the one died on her.’
       With the delayed imperative suffix -Yh, the suffix -si-/-o:si- adds
a note of urgent desire, as in the following:
176)     i:la-:si-Yh
         ARRIVE;HERE-dim-delay
         { islazsjh/
         ‘Be sure and come!""
Suffix Position 3:         Habitual
   Three suffixes fall into this slot, and all are closely related to each
other: -Vico- ‘habitual,’ -Vico-li- ‘customary, and                   -Vici
‘progressive.’ The almost unique feature of the suffixes in inducing
an accent in the vowel to which they are attached indicates that
they have differentiated from one basic form, However, the three
forms are monomorphemic and must be treated as distinct entities.

-Vhcorli-    ‘customarily’
   This suffix also occurs frequently. On the surface it appears to
be a compound of Vico- of position 3 and -:li- of position 7.
However, when an item of position 6 occurs, that item does not
appear between the elements, but after, which is'a strong indication
that this suffix is monomorphemic.         This suffix occurs most
frequently with indicators of past or future time, With an indicator
of past time, it can be translated as an imperfect; the action was
going on, but there is ng indication of its termination. With a
marker of future time, -Vicozli- indicates that the action will be
going On sometime in the future, and there is no indication of its
termination.

verb is going on at the present time, and there is no indication that
the action has a beginning or an ending.

differ in the details of their use.

but that the possibility exists that it will, or the speaker intends that
it will.      As with other vowel-initial suffixes, -d:/i- elides the vowel
terminating the preceding element.      The                  Mikasuki suffix -d-h-
‘Future I’ is cognate (Boynton 1982:103).

There is a slight semantic difference between the two constructions,
that with -@-hi-k appears to have a more limited reference, while
that with the verbal noun seems to be more gemeral. The following

   The. suffix -d:hi- has several specialized uses.           With the
interrogative, it forms polite questions, as in the following examples.

compound tenses concerning actions that had the potential to be
fulfilled, but were unrealized.

 the realis suffixes -toho- and -toha-. These suffixes do not indicate
 tense, but rather that an action is done or yet to be done. The
 association of these two concepts reflects the basic Koasati view of
 time as divided into two sections, the now and the not-now
                                                            ;          the
 present covers the now, and the realis/irrealis the not-now.
                                                               This
 duality is reflected in the verb ihé;can, which means both ‘to be
 long ago’ and ‘to be a long time in the future,” and which is
 frequently used as an adverbially derived form.“
-laho-      ‘irrealis; future’
  This suffix indicates that the action of the verb will take place
some time in the future. Phonologically, -laho- is unusual in that it
apocopates the first person singular subject cross-reference marker,
-li, reducing it to -/-, and also the first person plural suffix of class
2A, -hili-, reducing it to -hil-,as in the following example.

   It is possible to negate the futurity of the action without negating
the action itself. This is accomplished by verbalizing the verb
phrase with the emphatic/copular suffix -o- and negating the suffix
according to its 3Cii pattern, as in the following examples.

         ‘She was going to have a baby,’
-laha-      ‘irrealis; future’
   This suffix is very much rarer than -laho-; it only occurs in word-
final position and can only be followed by the nasalizing phrase-
terminal marker or an enclitic. It is more emphatic than -/aho- and
indicates that the action will indeed occur.""

 -toha-     ‘realis; perfect’
       This suffix is as rare in comparison with -toho- as -laha- is in
comparison to -laho-. It is used to indicate that the action has been
completed, thus it is equivalent to the perfect. It is also like the
suffix Jaha- in that only the nasalizing phrase-terminal marker or
an enclitic may follow it. An unusual feature of -toha- is that when
suffixed to the sequence -o:1-0- (the article-suffix -o:to- ‘deceased’
plus the verbalizer -9-) the sequence collapses into -o:toha-.

   When      phrases with suffixes such as. -d:pi- are negated, the
position of the negative cross-referencing morpheme differs with the
scope of the negation, as in the following example.

modification indicated by a verbal
person negative suffix typical of class 3Ci follows the element to be
negated (except for those few suffixes that have a special negative
form.)
  The suffix -@:pi-, in combination with the deductive suffix ~i-,
forms a complex that, suffixed to nouns, gives  the meaning ‘it is

Suffix Position 9: Dubitative
  This slot is filled by the suffixes -mdzmi- (which has the
apocopated form -md-) and ~md:s. These suffixes are used to
indicate that the speaker          has doubts      about    the possibility or
occurrence of an action.
-ma:mi-    “perhaps; maybe’
   This suffix is the most common form of the dubitative.

  The apocopated form -mé- is used when the suffix -Vhco- follows.
The string that results, -mdhco-, has the meaning of ‘ever’ with
affirmative verbs or ‘never’ with negative verbs, as in the following
examples.

        ""Because they had never seen such peopleas those, it is said that they were
         afraid.’
-mé:s     ‘dubitative of observation’
  This suffix is one of the rarest, with very few occurrences noted.
It is derived     historically from     the phrase-final      form   of -mi:mi-,
followed by DEL, -md;:m, followed by the phrase-terminal marker
-§ (for a discussion of which see below). With the obsolesence of
the marker -5, the form -méd:¥ became lexicalized as -ma:s. This
suffix seems to be used to indicate that the speaker is dubious
about an action she is in the process of observing. The following is
the only unequivocal example of the use of this suffix.

Suffix Position 10: Hearsay
  This slot is filled by the single suffix -pa-, one of the most
frequently occurring suffixes in the language. It indicates that the
speaker has knowledge of the action only through the words of
others. It may describe either second-hand knowledge or first-hand
knowledge being reported to another. In the latter case, -mpa- is
used to incorporate quoted speech into an utterance, as in the
         { taétwamp/
         ‘He, says that he, sings.’
 Due to the distinctive énkak-ké:han frame for most Koasati quoted
 speech, the sentence in example 282a can never be construed as
 referring to the speaker, as an English translation can (cf. example
 282c).
 282c)   tilwa-li-mp
         SING-Iss-hearsay
         / talwalimp/
         “He says that I sing.’
The above example shows the difficulty of applying transformational
theory to Koasati. On a deep level, the énkak-kd:han frame has to
be equivalent to -mpa-, yet that suffix has no phonological or
morphological similarity to the frame. This theory also does not
take into account that if the subject of the verb encompassed by the
frame is in the second person, then in order for the suffix -mpa- to
operate correctly, the verb must be transformed from a second
person form to a first person form, if the addressee is the one who
is repeating the quoted speech (see examples 282a and 282b),

         / cokfa:tihitk6n amm@hiska7ht? /
         ""Would you tell me a traditional narrative?”
If the frame contains a first person form (a third person subject
speaking of herself), then the first person form must be transformed
into the third person when -mpa- is to be suffixed. However, this
formal complexity is not reflected in the actual ease with which
speakers employ the suffix.
  The following are examples of the use of the hearsay suffix.

   Numerous other examples of -mpa- can be found in this chapter
and elsewhere throughout this work.
Suffix Position 11: Auditory
  This slot is filled by the single suffix -hawa-, which indicates that
the speaker knows of the action through hearing, but not seeing, the
action occur.     The word-final form, -ha, is unusual; comparative
evidence indicates it should be *-haw. Perhaps originally the suffix
was   *-hahwa-; in final position it would have had the form *-hahw,
which would have been pronounced *[haAW], with the final two
elements devoiced. Then the devoiced elements would have been
lost, in the same way that the apocopated form of the adverbial
suffix -ftfina-, -fi, was formed. Later, the medial form *-hahwa-
would have been restructured as -hawa-, since the cluster /hw/ does
not occur in monomorphemic words in Koasati.
   The auditory suffix, structurally parallel to the hearsay suffix, is
the functional equivalent of a verb phrase followed by the switch-
reference marker -n and the verb hdzlon ‘to hear.’ It does not have
quite the transformational peculiarities of the hearsay suffix, for it
s rarely, if ever, used with verbs having a first or second person
iubject. The auditory suffix always has an impersonal flavor; that
s, ~hawa- is best translated by an English construction such as ‘one
van hear.’

          ‘One can hear the barking of the dog pack echoing from afar.’
    The suffix -hawa- seems to be related to the suffixes -hd-wa-
‘possibly’ and -ha?wa ‘rhetorical question’ (see below).
 Suffix Position 12: Tense
   This slot is filled by the four past tense suffixes, as well as the
 temporal suffix -(6:ka- and the negative imperative suffix -Vana.
 The Past Tense Suffixes
       The past tense suffixes (IPast, -sa-; [[Past, -ti-; Past, -fo-; and
 IVPast, -ki-) indicate at what point in the past an action took place;
 they are ordered in relation to each other. The word-final forms of
 the IIPast and IIIPast suffixes are identical (-f-) and, for this reason,
 to several years ago.
    The [VPast suffix, -ki-, indicates that the action took place many
 years ago. There is frequent overlap in the use of -fo- and -ki- in
 deferring to many years in the past; however, it is common for some
 speakers to use -fo- when referring to personal experiences, even
 when sixty or seventy years in the past, and to use -ki- when
 referring to actions performed by others at such a length of time.
 One reason may be that the tense suffix -ki- is used in traditional
narrative        as   almost   the   sole   tense   suffix   and    so     has   strong
connotations of mythological time. Or, the reason could be simple
vanity; by not using the IVPast suffix to refer to one’s own actions,
one does not admit to the possibility of being very old.*” On the
other hand, some speakers use the IVPast tense suffix with aplomb
in talking about themselves.

          ‘He cut it off, and cooked it for him, and gave il to him to eat, so it is said!’
<fé:ka-      ‘when; while’
   This suffix indicates that while one action is in progress, another
is about to take place, or is taking place. The two subjunctive
suffixes -:p and -:k are semantically similar to -:fé:ka- in that they
also can be translated as ‘when.’ However, while the subjunctive
suffixes are used when the action is either unrealized or generalized,
+f6:ka- is used whenever the action is actual or specific. This suffix
has cognates in Hitchiti (-kfof:jki) (Gatschet 1884:143) and
Mikasuki (-kfo:k-) (personal fieldnotes), and Apalachee (-:fo:ka)
(Kimball 1987:153). Because they are mutually exclusive, -fé:ka-
is listed here with the tense suffixes. It rejects occurrence with
suffixes indicating time in general, but it will occasionally occur with
the realis/irrealis suffixes. The suffix occurs invariably with one of
three discourse suffixes: -ok ‘same subject with focus,’ -on ‘different
subject with focus,’ and -p ‘new topic.’ Quite often the suffix string
<fo:kok is reduced to -:fé:k, due to syncope in the final syllable; the
intermediate stage [:f6:kOk] can also be heard.

  The subjunctive suffix added          to the h-grade (sahimin) or the
liminutive (sdémmozsin) of the verb sémmin ‘to be how,’ forms
vomplexes that are lexicalized as the adverbs sahmi:p ‘sometimes
with   some    regularity!’ and sdmmo:sizp           ‘sometimes   [not very
requently].’
k “if; when’ subjunctive II
 In contrast to the subjunctive I suffix -;p, which indicates that the
ction of the verb is only potential or unreal, the subjunctive Il
uffix indicates that the action is a generalized possibility. It is
requently used for actions that might be done to achieve a certain
oal.

 equivalent to the words because, for and since in English statements
 of cause.

  This suffix indicates that the action following the action of the
verb to which it is affixed is contrary to what one might expect.              It
differs from -tik ‘but,’ which occurs in position 14 and indicates that
the speaker has no expectations as to what action might occur.
This suffix may be followed only by -ok ‘same subject, focus’ or -on
‘different subject, focus,’ and cannot occur in word-final position.
This suffix may be related to the nominal suffix -Vy, which
introduces a statement that is contrary to expectation.

          “We were going to go to church, but contrary to expectation, we siayed

     This last example shows that if the suffix -y- is not added to the
 first element in an expression (in this case amé:halkalahok), it may
be added          to the second     element without change          in meaning.
 Nevertheless, the semantic order in this construction is rigid; no
matter where the suffix -y- is put, it is always the first element to
which the indication of contrariness to expectation is applied.
-tika-    ‘but’
   This suffix indicates that a statement is about to be made
contrary to something stated in the verb to which it is suffixed.
Unlike the suffix -y-, which also occurs in this slot, -tika- does not
indicate that the following phrase is contrary to the expectations of
the speaker. This suffix is never followed by the switch-reference
markers -k or -n; however, it does occur with the new-topic marker
?p.

The Phrase-Terminal Markers: DEL,    VY, and §
  The Koasati phrase-terminal markers are features unique to the
language.    They are not found in Alabama, a language otherwise
closely related to Koasati (Lupardus 1983),      Creek and Mikasuki
have an “indicative” suffix -s, which may be related to Koasati -5;
however, the former use of - in Koasati (it is now obsolete) was so
specialized that the two suffixes may not be cognate.
The Phrase-Terminal Marker DEL
  This phrase-terminal marker deletes the final vowel of a verb,”
when the Jatter is unaccented and the marker -Y is not applied.
Historically, this phrase-terminal marker seems to have arisen from
the devoicing of phrase-final vowels. As indicated above in the
discussion of the apocopated form of the suffix -/fhna-, devoiced
segments in Koasati are highly unstable and are apt to be lost.
Thus, the loss of a phrase-final vowel became lexicalized as the
marker of the end of a phrase.
   Because the phrase-terminal marker DEL is so common and due
to its subtractive effect, it has not been specified in the
morphological descriptions of examples to cut down on the clutter
of morphological abbreviations and to bring the morphological form
of the examples closer to what is actually pronounced.        In the
following examples, however, DEL will be marked.
332)   azt-i:pa-coba-k
       PERSON-EATER-BIG-subj
        “He lies over here!” he said.’
   Due to the operation of this phrase-terminal marker, it is easy to
confuse certain forms, such as -k ‘switch-reference marker, same
subject,’ and -k ‘IVPast,’ the latter from -kKi-DEL; {2s ‘they dwell,’
from f:sa-DEL,     and f:s‘he takes it,’ from f:si-DEL,and hOkf ‘he puts
it on,’ from Adékfa-DEL and hékf ‘he puts it in,’ from hokfi-DEL,.
This kind of homonymy seems to have led to the demise of the
IlPast suffix -ti-, the vowel-deleted form of which is identical to the
vowel-deleted form of the IIPast suffix -t0-, -t. At times Koasati
speakers use this property of the phrase-terminal marker for
humorous effect, as in the following example:

                  Ipls(1A)-ARRIVE-phr:term
                 /i1/     homophonous with iM-DEL,/ il       ‘it is dead’
                  “We are here!’ (said by people arriving at someone's housc)

                 / nf&sok {2112 /
                 “What's dead?’
The Phrase-Terminal Marker ¥
  The use of the phrase-terminal marker ¥ (vowel nasalization) in
opposition to DEL       is not entirely clear; however, it seems to be
where the deletion of the final vowel would cause serious loss of
meaning. Examples of contrast between Y/ and DEL are hard to
find, but the most common one is with the IIPast and IilPast
suffixes, which with DEL fall together as + (glossed merely as
‘Past’), while with Y they maintain their identities as -ti- and -to-.
Many examples of ¥ are found in this chapter and throughout this
work, so none will be illustrated here.
   As mentioned in chapter 2, in the speech of certain very old
persons, 7 has the realization of fh after a, y after i, and w after o,
as in the following.

       ‘Nowadays, it is just so. It seems that they go about as barred owls.’
   It is tempting to see -*/ as the historical origin of this. phrase-
 terminal marker, as 4 in vowel-/t sequences before a consonant
 frequently takes on the character of the preceding vowel. The
 nasalization present in the speech of middle-aged and younger
comment since it was first described by Haas and ascribed by her
only to male speakers of the language (1944). At present, this
marker is obsolete; nonetheless, several consultants were able to
produce forms using it. However, contra Haas, the consultants
ascribed -§ to women as well. It seems likely, though at this late
date no longer provable beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this
marker was used in the speech of persons of high status. In the
author's articles on the topic (Kimball 1987; 1990)             there is a full
discussion of the use and meaning of this marker.
   The  pronunciati on of -§ was given almost universally as [3], which
may have been a contrastive phoneme.           Phonemes of limited
occurrence are not unusual in Koasati, as witnessed by the presence
of the glottal stop and the vowels /e/ and /u/ in interjections. The
phrase-terminal marker -§ was added after the phrase-terminal
markers DEL and ¥. In the author's data, -§ appears as -F after
DEL     and as -:¥ after ¥ and after DEL               when    the word-final
consonant is a nasal, which is deleted.

The Switch-Reference Markers
  Koasati, like other Muskogean languages, has a system of switch-
reference marking that indicates whether the subject of a clause has
the same or a different subject from the following clause. The basic
forms of the switch-reference markers-are -k for a clause with an
identical following subject and -n for a clause with a different
following subject. These suffixes have forms with greater emphasis,
or focus, as it is sometimes        referred to:     -ok for same   subject
reference and -on for different subject (see Nicklas, 1972:211 for
details of a parallel system in Choctaw). In addition, the switch-
reference marker -p indicates that a new topic is being introduced
or that new information is being proferred. The switch-reference
suffixes are identical to the nominal case suffixes -k ‘nominative,’
-n ‘accusative,’ and -p ‘new topic.’ It seems likely that originally
they were unitary nominal or nominalizing morphemes that have
become distinct from their distinctive uses.
  Switch reference in Koasati is used to disambiguate actors in a
complex narrative, especially when there are two or more third
person subjects. This construction leads to a great economy of
expression and a lack of the ambiguity that can occur in parallel
constructions in English. The switch-reference suffixes are discussed
further in the chapter 19 (Syntax),

Connective Suffixes
   Of the two connective suffixes - and -h, the former, a
coordinating conjunctive suffix, is by far the most common, It
indicates that the subject of the verb is the same as that of a
following verb or verbs and that the actions of all verbs are taking
place simultaneously or in a very quick sequence. Only the last
verb of a sequence will bear any person cross-reference markers or
verbal suffixes; verbs suffixed with -t cannot take any of these. In
this regard -¢ differs from the switch-reference marker -k ‘same
Subject,’ with which the cross-reference markers and verbal suffixes
can and are often used and which does not have the same strong

       “When he fell sick [with a seizure}, when he fell to the ground, he whirled
        around, and rolled around; he drooled and frothed at the mouth; foam
        came out of his: mouth, and his whole body turned bluc.’
   As a subordinating conjunctive suffix, - subordinates the
meaning of the following verb to that of the preceding. The only
certain example of this suffix occurs when it precedes the verb
bannan ‘to want; to need.’ The whole complex -h bannan then
means ‘to try to.’ In this use -h is quite common, otherwise it is very
rare.

   All five of the interrogative suffixes seem to have been formed
from other items by means of the interrogative internal change, V7V
(see chap. 9). However, as suffixes of similar phonological shape
are very different in meaning, these suffixes will be treated as
monomorphemic items.
-O?lf ‘simple question’
   This suffix indicates that a statement has been transformed into
a question. It is not used as frequently as the interrogative change;
it seems to occur most often on nouns and on verbs with a past

-Vh ‘first delayed imperative’
  This suffix is one of only two in this position that do not fall into
one of the above categories. It has been placed in this slot because
it never has any suffix following it, like most suffixes of this slot, and
it has no relatives in any other slot. The phonological form of -/h
is quite unusual; examples of Alabama imperatives in Sylestine,
chapter 6.

-Vhah     ‘second delayed imperative’
   The position of this rare suffix affirms the placement of the
 phonologically similar first delayed imperative in suffix position 14,
 after the tense suffixes.    ‘This suffix, unlike the first delayed
 imperative, which is used only in imperative contexts, can be used
 to indicate that any action is taking place at a vague future date.
 For further information on the use of this suffix in imperatives, see

       This enclitic is extremely frequent in texts. It indicates that the
 phrase       to     follow     contains   a   contradiction      of   the   previous
phrase—not a contradiction of expectation (like -y- or a simple
 ‘but,’ like -tika), but rather an indication that the situation has
 changed from one phrase to the other.

  It is difficult to ‘say what the origin of the enclitic katika is. It
seems to be composed of the suffix -fika “but’ and an element ka-,
which appears to be an archaic verb meaning ‘to be.”
méhco     ‘it is a similar occurrence to’
   This enclitic, which is clearly related to the nominal adjectives
mahco ‘more or Jess’ and ma:mi ‘like to,’ indicates that the action
of the verb to which it is attached lacks some of its usual intensity.
This enclitic requires a following switch-reference or connective
suffix, It does not seem to co-occur with the phrase-terminal
marker DEL and thus appears to be approaching the status of a
true suffix.

   This is an extremely rare suffix; only a few examples in texts were
noted. It is said by speakers to be an exact equivalent of the
complex      -d:hik bannan ‘to want to’ (which is the construction most
frequently used to express that idea, followed by the construction of
the verbal noun followed by bannar).

  The origin of -d:s is obscure. Since it was first elicited in a study
of the phrase-terminal marker -§, -d:s may be derived from the
ntentive suffix -4- followed by the marker -5, thus originally being
»xronounced [-4:5].        When -5 fell out of use, this sequence was
‘estructured as a unitary morpheme, and the pronunciation changed
o [4:$] to fall in line with the pronunciation of word-final /s/ (see
chap. 2).

With time words, this suffix can be used to mean ‘about’; thus from
nakso:fé:kon     ‘when?’ can be derived nakso:fo:kaffi:non ‘about
when?’ Furthermore, -ffi:na- is used to derive the terms for the
semicardinal directions, which are verbs: falammihaso:tammiffi:nan
‘to be the northwest,’ falammi hasachalf:kaffi:nan ‘to be the
northeast,’ oko:mahli haso:tammiffi:nan ‘to be the southwest,’ and
oko:mahli hasachali:kaffi:nan ‘to be the southeast.’ See chapter 12

   This suffix, which is not infrequent, indicates that the actor is able

difference between this suffix, the suffix -halpi:sa-, and the

suffix -halpt:sa-is used in general statements of ability, samumin. is
used when the ability or inability to do a previously mentioned
action is discussed, and -Vitc is used when the speaker believes that
the action can or cannot be done. As a rule the suffix -Vhc is used

   This suffix is used to translate English phrases like ‘as long as’
and ‘as far as.’ It is related to the independent noun wayif ‘edge.’
The variant forms seem to code transitivity in the verb to which
they are suffixed, with verbs bearing -wayka:p being intransitive and
verbs bearing wayli:p transitive. Nonetheless, examples are not
common enough to determine this question at present.

 ‘1. Koasati is rich in terms for describing poverty.       Stibaktin   refers to the
 atal pain brought about by poverty; bassin refers to the weakness and Icthargy
 maght on by not being able to obtain cnough to eat; hobékein refers to the
  bilityof a person without cnough food to do useful work; sowwin refers to the
 aness and emaciation brought on by insufficient food; possdhlin describes a baby
 ible to thrive duc to poor nutrition; and andchin refers to the lack of adequate
  thing due to poverty. An adjunct to this concern with poverty and lack of food
 he equation of fatness with beauty. All terms in the language connected with
 aness or slenderness are negative, with the sole exception of patiknan ‘to be
 i-stomached,’ which in any case is related more to muscle hardness than actual
 aderness. Thus, the average Indian idea of beauty is entirely the opposite to
 1 in general American culture,
 \2. The use of this term, literally ‘to make a musical sound to somcone from
 r,' relates to the belief that when a person's cars ring, Someone is speaking of
 3. Literally, this term means ‘to call out to someone from afar’; it is now used
 marily to refer to the use of the telephone. The object of the verb is marked

 \4, The verbal noun of this verb, mastaliind, has its meaning specialized to

                term refers to a court of law.
 6. The verb h&ion is used to mean ‘possessed of supernatural power,” hollé
 ng a (erm for that idea expressed by the Algonquian manido. However, as in
 ve Algonquian languages (notably Shawnee), the term for Supermatural power
 x¢ to refer to evil power and finally to something frightening or dangerous. The
  meaning of the word occurrs in the term tahollé ‘Sunday,’ derived from nihté
  5 “holy day,’
  !, This is a verbalization of the verb phrase sta,ki,/-0-V (instr-LIKE,3neg(2C),-

  in the negative ‘to dislike,’
campoilifjNté?lk? ‘Was it too sweet?’ which in rapid speech is pronounced
[Campo:lifj 2621)}.
  21. This rule (more fully stated as: when three consonants come together across
a morpheme boundary, if onc is a glottal and the others are not members of a
geminate cluster, the glottal consonant drops out) explains why the glottal stop
disappears in the interrogative form of a verb with a consonant cluster between the
ultimate and penultimate syllables of the verb, This rule is violated only in the case
of the h-grade form of a verb, and then only in careful speech (sce chap, 9).
   22; The only difficulty with this hypothesis is that the verb a(pi-san means ‘lo be
mean; nasty.” The semantic shift between -halpi-sa-, stalpi-san, and alpi:san is
inexplicable at present,

     ihokizcokon     ‘recently’
      ihdAcatikkon ‘in nota very long time’
   24, It is tempting to see the irrealis suffix -laha- (as well as the corresponding
realis -toha-) as being bimorphemic: -laho- (or -toho-) followed by an emphatic
suffix -2. However, no such emphatic morpheme exists. Booker (1980:140,146)
treats the forms ending in o as bimorphemic; however, the usage of the suffixes
-toho- and -laho- does nol support her conclusions. The meaning of the forms
cading in o is more gencralized, that of the forms ending in a more specific.
  25. This statement focuses not on the motion of the wind, as in the English, but
on the location of its blowing. Toa Koasati speaker, the wind that is now here was
once in the north, so the. realis is used,
  26. Gencrally the suffix string -o-l-d:p-ok is used with no following phrase.
When onc complains about being barked at by a dog, the response is simply if-o-

   27. The Koasati have mixed feelings about old age.          Respect for elders and
obedience to their wishes are basic cultural beliefs, bul they also have a stereotype
of the old person as intrusive, sharp-tongued, ill-tempered, willful, and prone to
witchcraft. In fact, the most vicious way in which an old person is insulted (usually
out of hearing range) is to call him opac&ba ‘old owl,’ the opé, or barred owl,
being the avatar of the witch.

Verbal Conjunction       Verbs can be joined together in two ways:                   by the connective
suffixes -¢ and -/ or by the switch-reference marker -k. Leaving the
suffix -1 out of the discussion for the present (on account of its
rarity), the connective suffix -( is used when the actions are
considered to take place more or less simultaneously; the switch-
reference marker -k is used when the actions are considered to be
 taking place in a sequence. In the following example the three
 actions of running over, killing, and squashing are considered to be
 more or less simultaneous, thus requiring the connective suffix -t.
 43)     Kolti hisca-li-:fozka-p mobi:la-k pa:-kondtlit f:bi-t
      ‘Sometimes, if you want it, you can go and look for it, pop it, and eat it”
The following example shows -t and -k used together in a complex
sentence. (Note also the use of switch reference in its formation.)

   At times, even if the actions occur at the same time, the verbs
can be joined with -k if the actions are considered not to have an
intimate relation with one another, as in the folowing example.

 conveyed by the verbal suffixes in the consequence position (see
 chap. 4). On the other hand, the idea of ‘or’ is most generally
This word, probably the old verbal noun of the obsolete verb ‘to

The word i/kg has been noted only once in natural speech (example
52) and all the conditions for its use remain uncertain.               It seems
likely that it is used when the alternative offered is the one which
the speaker wishes the hearer to choose,               Since apposition is the
most unmarked way to offer alternatives, the use of f/kgis a signal
to the hearer that the speaker wishes to guide the choice. Very
frequently, the sentence particle inkg (see below) is used in the
sense of ‘or’ when the two possibilities are mutually contradictory.

      The third method of noun conjunction is accomplished by means
of the reciprocal verb prefix itti-/ittim- or the linking verbs a:san “to
be with’ (frequently with the reciprocal prefix as if@:san) and
stkion ‘to be together,’ the latter derived from the verb s6k/on ‘to
be two in number.’
  Examples 59:and 60 show the use of the reciprocal prefix in noun
conjunction.       (Note that the initial noun is in the nominative case,
and the following noun in in the autonomous case.)

  The idea expressed by the English conjunction or is generally left
unexpressed in Koasati. When a choice between two nouns is
given, they are offered in apposition to each other, as a general
rule.

 Just as when pressed for a lexical item meaning ‘or’ in verbal
 conjunction, speakers can produce an item meaning ‘or’ in nominal
 conjunction: the suffix -o:kop, which is suffixed to the first noun in
 the choice; the second item obligatorily takes the focus form of the
 accusative case, -o7.

Because the suffix -o:kop has never been noted in unforced speech,
the conditions for its proper use remain unknown.
Conjunctive Words
   Koasati has a plethora of conjunctive words, which are used
primarily in discourse, at the beginning of sentences, These words
relate the actions of the previous sentence to the following sentence
in terms of sequence, dependence, and causality. Additionally,
nearly all are marked with switch-reference markers indicating
whether the following sentence has the same or a different subject
than the previous sentence.
   Although conjunctive words are numerous, there are only three
roots: mammin, akkammin, and *ma. The verb mdammin is used
independently with the meaning ‘to occur by chance, to happen’; it
contrasts with the verb mayé:ban ‘to occur by a fortunate chance.’
form often occurs, especially in the speech of the young. It is likely
that in the future the form akkd:min will be generalized for use in
conjunctive words. The initial syllable ak- in this word is frequently
dropped in all but careful speech.
  The root *ma, from which the conjunctive words ma:fo:kon,
méztohon,   and    their      relatives    are          formed,   no   longer   occurs
independently.     Like the other pre-Koasati monosyllabic verb
roots—*a ‘to give,’ *ka ‘to be,’ and *ka: ‘to say’—this verb has been
eliminated from the language except in changed or relic forms (see
chap. 3 for a discussion of the reflexes of ""a, “ka, and *ka: in the
present-day language).         Finally, the adverb himé.ya (var. hind-ya)
‘now’ occasionally occurs introducing sentences in discourse.                              It
occurs with the new-topic suffix -p or with the adverb mdr ‘again’;
it has not been noted to occur with any switch-reference suffixes.
(See the texts in chap. 21 and elsewhere for examples of
conjunctive words.)

Sentence Particles
  The sentence particles y6, md, md, and fnkg form an obscure and
difficult element of'the grammar of Koasati. Occurring at a low but
steady frequency, these words, which native speakers cannot explain
in English, require further study. The particles yé, ma, and mé are
all affirmative, while inkgis negative.
   The negative particle inkgin various forms, is used in a sentence
when a speaker makes a sudden shift in topic, either adding
material or changing something mentioned earlier in the same
sentence, or in a previous sentence. When inkgoccurs without any
following element, the final vowel is nasalized.

      The      three   affirmative   particles—yé,    ma,   and    mé—are.      more
difficult to characterize. All seem to have some emphatic force, but
the exact nature of this force is not clear. They seem to be related
to the deictics yd ‘this’ and md ‘that.’ It seems to be possible to
translate yé. as ‘in this way’ and md and mé ‘in that way’; however,
the most natural English rendering for all three seems to be ‘thus’
or some sort of emphasis. Y6 is quite rare, and mé is much rarer
than mé,           All are enclitic in nature, and the particles yO and md
usually occur with a nasalized vowel.

      The affirmative particles may be related to the adverbs mdk and
mén,      which     mean     ‘also,’   and   to   man,   which     means       ‘again.’
Although from their form these adverbs look as though they could
have switch-reference functions, they occur indifferently whether or
not the subject of the sentence has changed. When following a
noun they eliminate the case suffix of the noun, but do not take
case themselves. The only trends noticable are that dk most often
occurs after a noun in a sentence, while man and mén occur more
 often in sentence-initial or secondary position. Occasionally one of
 these adverbs will function like a particle, which leads to the
 supposition of their relationshipto the affirmative particles,

both languages difficult.>         Eyen when such shades come to be
understood,      rendering     them    into English         is not simple.     The
common      word    in traditional narrative, ka:hatoho:limpdahcok,             has
been rendered as ‘she [he] said, so it is reported.’ However, this
rendering lacks the nuances of completion, deduction, habituality,
and far distance in time that.are basic to Koasati semantics.
  This section, which covers meaning and stylistic use of the
internal changes, terms denoting emotions, and idioms, is merely an
overview of the topic; an in-depth study could reap a rich harvest
of information.
The Internal Changes
  In chapter 9 the forms and functions of the various internal
changes were sketched out. In addition, the indicative, the aorist,
the h-grade, and the n-grade have stylistic functions in discourse.
Some of these functions will be sketched out below.
   The indicative is the most frequently used of the internal changes,
because it is the only one which allows for extensive use of the
system of verbal suffixes.       The gnomic present—that is, the
indicative with no suffixes—is rarely used. Instead, when an idea is
to be conveyed in the present tense, the habitual or progressive
suffixes are used. The habitual suffix expresses action that occurs
continually with little change (example 89), and the progressive
suffix denotes action that, although at present occurring, may yet
change (example 90).

   One of the more notable features of plain narrative is the use of
the historical present, which also occasionally is found in traditional
narrative. This is manifested by some verbs not showing the tense
or aspect marking that would indicate their actions taking place in
the past. This stylistic device makes the narrative more vivid to the
hearer and gives it more immediacy. In a text where the historical
present is used, occasional verbs will be marked with tense or
aspect to cue the listener to the proper temporal location of the
narrative. In the following selections the historical present forms
are italicized in the word-by-word transcripton.

        ‘But this being so, I ask my late mother, “Why is i always mocking all the
         birds?” I say. “The mockingbird is, so it is said, the preacher of the birds,”
        she says, telling ito me. “In.summer, it lives about in the trees, it mocks
        and Mics up, gocs and hovers in the air, returns to the same branch, comes
        and roosts on it, makes noise, it lifts up its wings and puts them down, it
        jumps about among the branches and lives among them,” she uscd to say,
        telling it 10 me.’
      In the following excerpt—the            climax of the story of how the
Williamses’ house was destroyed by a tornado—with the exception
of four realis forms that offer background information, all the action
is in the historical present. When the tape of story was played to
the sister of the narrator, who had gone through the experience
with  her, she said, “I saw it right before my eyes again.”

The aorist form of the verb ihdssan ‘to be empty; to feel empty,’

of emptiness among them that does not end. The feeling existed in
the past, exists now, and will exist so long as there are those who

can be used, but its literal meaning, that the subject is happy about
something, lacks the connotations of ‘pride.’ On the other hand,
the term ilakasé:mon indicates that someone is proud of his abilities
or talents, but it also means that he treats others badly because of
this pride. Thus, ilakasé:mon covers only what can be termed evil
pride, or hubris. A term like hubris almost never occurs in everyday
English speech; however, in Koasati, not only is the term well
known, but the comeuppance that characters suffer as a result of
possessing ilakasamorika is the theme of many traditional
narratives,   Once there was a word that meant, ‘to be proud,’ the
now-forgotten akasa:mon, preserved only in the writings of Brinton.
Thus, a change in attitudes toward emotions seems to have led to
the loss of a word to describe a certain one.
  Another feature lost in going from one language to another is the
linguistic relationship between terms for certain emotions.     In
English to be in mourning and to mourn are clearly related; in
Koasati the first is rendered by ilahollé:cin, which refers to the
social customs of mourning; the second is rendered by the verb
compound imacthba:sit yahkan, which refers to the overpowering
feelings of sorrow expressed in weeping which occur after a death.
Imacihba:sit yahkan is in fact related to the verbs imacihba:cin ‘to
grieve someone,’ stimacihban ‘to worry,’ and imacthban ‘to be sad,
sorrowful.’ Thus, linguistic-relationships among terms referring to
emotions imply an attitude among the speakers of both languages
that links emotions and the words that signify them.
   Throughout Koasati there are a number of oppositions that are
novel to the nonnative speaker—for example the doublet oyyammin
‘to be strong tasting’ versus fopdksin ‘to be weak tasting’ and the
quadruplet asamhan ‘to be burnt [of boiled food],’ libd:tlin ‘to burn
{of a hot solid or liquid],’ atakban ‘to burn [of radiant heat],’ and
atini:lin ‘to burn with fire.’ However, such oppositions are logical
cimalokista, alokistg, etc.) ‘to be interested in something,’ used in
the meaning of ‘to dislike something’ only with inanimate objects.
   Table 20,2 lists most Koasati terms relating to emotional states.
All are verbs; nouns referring to emotional states are very rarely
used in Koasati, in contrast to English.

Idioms and Idiomatic Expressions
  Idioms and idiomatic expressions carry a semantic content that
adds to or differs from the surface semantics of the utterance.. It is
difficult to classify idioms, but two groups are readily apparent:
verbal prefixes in unusual uses, and idiomatic names for plants and
(more rarely) animals. Most other idioms have to do with weather
or other natural phenomena,
   Certain locative prefixes of verbs have been noted in idiomatic
uses.   For example, the verb triad pa:cokké:lin (sg)/ pa:cikki:kan
(du)/ pa:i:san (pl) ‘to sit on something’ has the additional meaning
‘to ride horseback’ and, by extension, ‘to ride in any kind of vehicle.’
In the same way, o:wd:yan (sg/du)/o:yomdahlin ‘to go about in water’
is used in the meaning of ‘to swim [of animals which habitually live
in water]’ and is opposed to o:hépkan ‘to swim [of human beings or
other terrestrial animals].’ The locative prefix compound on-a- also
has an idiomatic use: in the triad onad:tan (sg)/ onadswan (du)/
onai:san (pl), which means not only ‘to exist on or in [as insects in
fruit],’ but also ‘to be on all sides of; to fly all around fas butterflies
or hummingbirds around flowers].’ The locative prefix pa:- has
been noted in three additional idiomatic uses:                in the verb
pa:cayhan ‘to be raised up above normal,’ from cayhan ‘to be tall’;
in the verb pa:hdhpan ‘to be renovated,’ from hahkpan ‘to be new;
and in the verb pair pa:cofétlin (sg)/ pa:céffin (pl), ‘to attack
someone out of ambush; to strike [of snakes],’ derived from the pair
cofétlin (sg)/céffin (pl) ‘to jump.’ The locative prefix o:-/o:w- is used
in the expression o:yé:bin ‘to be condensation,’ from yé:bin “to be

tandtlin              ‘to descend’           atandtkan         ‘to surround somcthing’
The        prefixed   form       of batapkan,      with      the   addition      of the
instrumental prefix, becomes stabdétapkan ‘to have a single-car
automobile accident’; with the instrumental and reciprocal prefixes
it becomes. stittabatapkan ‘to have a multi-car accident.’ The
instrumental prefixes are notable for their idiomatic use (see the
examples in chap. 4, pp. 141-42).
   A number of plants and a few animals have idiomatic names;
many of these must have once had a mythological origin, but at
present, when speakers are asked why they use such names, they
simply say their parents used them. Certain idiomatic names are

tayyikdhno inné:ni      = “best woman's husband' = “bittern [bird]’
      Many other idiomatic expressions are concerned with natural
events. For instance, during a thunderstorm, when the lightning is
flashing continuously, in addition to the usual comment (example
99), the idiom in example 100 may be used.
99)     malmdhk-f:ho-s
        BE:LIGHTNING-ady
        / malmdhké:ho:s /
        ‘There is @ great amount of lightning.’
Koasati were in contact with some Algonquian peoples in former
times. The Muskogean belief, reflected in the Koasati metaphor for
lightning, was that lightning consisted of the arrows of the
Thunderer,
101)   winihka im-takt
       THUNDER 3poss-ARROW
       / winthka j taki /
       ‘the arrows of the Thunderer’
   When lightning hits something, it is referred to not as ‘striking’ or
‘hitting’ the object, but rather as ‘standing on’ it, as in the following.

       ""They were afraid of lightning. Lightning struck [lit., stood on] trees and
        the Thunderer shot trees; when they [lightning and Thunderer] did so, they
        [the old Indians} did not like it...’
In addition, mirages are considered to be a form of lightning. Thus,
when someone sees 4 mirage on the road, she would say:
buy food, they remark to each other:
104)     -pinaki anél-ok6m
         CACHED:FOOD FINISH(sg)-ss:foc BE
         / pinaki ané:lok 6m /
         ‘The cached food is all eaten up,’
At the present, this is just a saying, as no one caches food any
more, and as a general rule the word pinaki has come to mean “box
lunch.’ Nonetheless, it suggests to the hearer the deleterious effects
of constant bad weather.
       After a heavy rain has passed, and a mist rises up from the
ground, people will say:
105)     sattapol6-k hassikba:c
         BOX:TURTLE-subj LIGHT:GRASS:FIRE
         / sattapol6k hassikbaze/
          ‘Box Turtle is lighting a grass fire.’
Seeing this mist indicates that it will rain again the next day.
   When the wind is blowing strongly, and one is out in the forest,
and the tree branches creak in the wind, people may make one of
the following comments (example 106 is more common).
106)     itt6 insd:wa-k naks4hka-hawa-3s
         TREE BRANCH-subj MAKE:NOISE-audit-IPast
         / itt6 insd:wak naks4hkahawa:s /
         ‘One can bear the trce branches making noise.’
   When one sees a ring around the moon, one says:
108)   nitahasi-k int4l
       MOON-subj      SET:TRAP
       { nitahasik intat /
       ‘The moon is setting out his trap.’
The origin of this idiom is totally Jost, as no one now knows what
the moon is setting out his trap for.         The moon in Koasati
mythology was male, and although the evidence is not complete, the
sun was probably conceived of as female.
   During an eclipse of the sun or moon, one of the following
comments is appropriate.
109)   hasi-k itt-o:taméil
       SUN/MOON-subj_recip-PASS:BY

   Two birds have idiomatic epithets. The kingbird, hacipé-ti, is
known by the epithet oybéci ‘rainmaker,’ because it is believed that
if this bird is seen flying around, rainy weather is sure to come. The
red-bellied woodpecker, cacahké, is called hipli:ct ‘snow maker’ and
hiplt:cosi ‘little snow maker’ because it is believed that if someone
shoots this bird in winter, it will cause it to snow.
    When spring comes, and one hears the distinctive calls of the
cardinal and the bullfrog, one of the following may be said:
113) tiskommé-k ohayyf:c
     CARDINAL-subj MAKE:SUMMER
       / tiskommak ohayyi:c /
       ‘The cardinals make summer.’
114)   hanon6é-k ohayyi:c
       BULLFROG-subj           MAKE:SUMMER
       / hanon6k ohayyi:c /
       “The bullfrogs make summer,’
This idiom comes from the old belief that these animals, by their
calls, cause summer to come. The above examples could be more
loosely translated as ""The cardinals for bullfrogs] usher in summer.’
    When a bull is seen tearing the earth with its horns in anger, the
arose from analogy between the motion of the bull’s head against
the earth and the motion used to grease one’s hair.
   The owner of an animal or slave is termed the ‘person’ of the
animal or slave, as in ifa ima:ti ‘a dog's master.’

        “When they gathered the cotton, when the others weighed the weight, if it
        did not come out to just so much, the black people were beaten by their
        masters.’
In the example above the subject, verb, object word order in the
final phrase results from moving the yerb forward to give it more
prominence.         A semantically closer translation would be ‘their
masters beat the black people.’ The word order variation here
indicates the incredible nature of the action.
   A final idiom is used with animals: cats when purring are said to

also used to mean ‘to win against someone.’
Miscellaneous Idioms

Doubtless there are many other idioms that the writer did not have
the chance to record.

_          When a body part is paralyzed, it is said to be ‘dead on’ that
    person; if something paralyzes the body part, that thing ‘kills it on’
    the person. The verb sobdylin is used with the dative prefix in such
    contexts to indicate whether or not a person feels sensations.

      When someone’s stomach is growling, one can say either 123a,

are balla:kan (sg)/ balléskan (du)/ balkan (pl) ‘to lie [animate

Example 124 shows that death of an animate subject does not affect
its grammatical animacy.

Euphemisms
   The Koasati feel reticence about excretion, sexual functions, and
death, and generally use euphemisms in discussing such topics in
mixed company.     In sexually segregated groups, however, such
euphemisms are much less frequent.
  The two main verbs for excretion are hdswan ‘to urinate’ and
hoppé:lan ‘to defecate.’ The polite way to announce that one is
going to the bathroom, however, is to use the verb ohtdykan
(sg)/ohtoyéhkan (pl), which literally means ‘to go and return.’
125)     oh-dGyka-l-4-Y
         go:&-RETURN(sg)-1ss-intent-phr:term
         / ohtéykalf /
          ‘Tam going to the bathroom.’
       If one wants to be a little more specific and refer obliquely to
urination, one can say:
imi:sa ‘house of ground meat.’ This last is considered so revolting
that when it was accidently uttered in the presence of a woman
eating, she choked on her food, and complained most vehemently
about having to listen to such talk,
  There is also a euphemistic term for iccormmi ‘anus’; it is owwasi
‘rear end; the behind.’ On the other hand, iccommi is used in
insults, the most common of which are comniloca “Black Anus’ and
commilaykf ‘Dung Anus.’      The latter is also the nickname for
someone who cannot maintain bowel control while drunk,         There
is no euphemism for hdkcon ‘to fart,” for though people try not to
fart publically, when it happens, others laugh, Aékcor also is used
for the spraying of the skunk and of the stinkbug.
   In the discussion of sexuality euphemisms for the sexual organs
are taken from child language: for ikci ‘penis,’ the euphemism is
cic, for the term ikcd:li ‘vagina,’ the form is cocéd. For bihtin ‘to
have sexual intercourse with someone,’ the term acdkkin ‘to follow
someone,’ is used; if adultery is the subject, inkoybdhlin   ‘to steal
something from someone’ is preferred.     To speak about rape, the
euphemism fabétkan (sg)/ taba:kan (pl) ‘to catch something’ is
used.*   There is, however, no euphemism     for the term sdslin ‘to
masturbate,” as masturbation is never discussed in mixed company.
  For the verbs fllin (sg/du)/ hépkan (pl) ‘to die,’ the most common
euphemism is nakdttan ‘to go off; to disappear.’ It is used in
almost exactly the same way as the English euphemism pass away.
Another euphemism, which is rather rare, yet elegant, is hifoshifkak
imané:kan ‘for breath to finish on someone,’ plural /ifoshilkak
imanéskan, roughly meaning ‘to breathe one’s last.’ That hifoshilka
‘breath’ was another way of expressing solokci ‘soul,’ is attested by
  Humor is a topic too broad for treatment in a discussion of
idiomatic usages, and deserves a study of its own. Nevertheless,
included here is a sketch of the major forms of linguistic humor:
punning and-word plays.
   Punning occurs frequently among the Koasati.

          A:    ‘Itstinks,    What stinks?’
   Interlingual puns between Koasati and English also occur, as in

           B: ‘I'm aot Chicano; I'm Indian!’
  Interlingual puns between English and French, incorporated into

    1. When such SVO constructions were offered, the author would often
rearrange the order to SOV, and offer it back to the speaker. The author was
frequently told how   much      better the SOV     word   order sounded   and was
complemented on his learning of the language.
when they are tolerably flucnt in both, attests to the separation of the two
languages,
  This lack of interface docs not prevent loan words from being taken into the
language, as shown in chap. 17, but frequently such words are taken with no real
understanding as to their meaning. For cxample, the tcrm for ‘slingshot’ isa loan
compound nikaséitka    shécca,   borrowed   from the colloquial local term nigger
shooter. It is clear, however, that the agentive noun shooter was not understood,
so the Koasati agentive noun shécca ‘shooter of things with’ was added to indicate
what a nikasdtka was.
    4, The verb tabatkan/tabitkan is therefore almost never used with humans
(except for catching criminals), To say that someone has gotten caught by
something, the verb ficifkan ‘to be trapped’ is used.
    $. The verb ittakla:n&cin is made up of the verb la:né:cin ‘to brown
something’ and the obsolete prefix compound iftak-, from itta- ‘action in fire’ and
ak- ‘action on the skin or surface of something.’ Thus, in making the pun, the
second speaker replaced the verb ittakla:nixcin     with the verb iffakloca:cin   “to
blacken something on the surface,’ punning on the elements fla:na/ “brown"" and
floca/ ‘black.’
   There are several speech styles in Koasati, some obsolete and
others still productive.
Conversation
   Conversation is typified by short utterances and the frequent use
of graded verb roots, participial forms, and interrogatives. Longer
utterances tend toward parallel restatement of an idea, which is
more typical of the various kinds of narrative. Only fragmentary
examples of conversation were recorded; the Koasati objected in no
uncertain terms to the use of the tape recorder, probably because
the permanent recording of unguarded speech is repugnant to
Koasati ideas of privacy. Since examples of conversation can be
found elsewhere in this work, none are included in this chapter.
Plain Narrative
   This form of speech, called a:tihilka ‘story,’ is typified by a
generally straightforward recital of facts. Plain narrative can range
from simple description, such as the many short texts on natural
history, excerpts of which appear in this work, to the highly
                                                                   571
concerned with the Trickster-Hero Rabbit, his name has been given
to the entire genre. There does seem to be a psychological division
between those traditional narratives that take place in mythological
time and are concerned with the semianthropomorphic animals, and
those which take place in semihistorical time, and could possibly
have a basis in fact. There are speakers who claim to be totally
ignorant of cokfatihilka, yet are able to tell fine semihistorical
stories, which are stylistically identical to cokfa;tihilka.
   Linguistically, most literary narratives are typified by the
occurrence of the suffix string toho-:limpa-Vhco-ki-DEL or tolo-
:li-mpa-ki-DEL, [-toho:limpahcok] or [-toho:limpak], added to verbs
at intervals. This string indicates that the action took place long
ago, that it was habitual but is now completed, that the knowledge
of it may have been arrived at by deduction, and that it was not
experienced by the narrator, but rather the knowledge was obtained
through hearsay.    There is a tendency in literary narrative, as in
plain narrative, for ideas to be put forth, then restated in a modified
form.   In some of the best examples of literary narrative,
onomatopoetic sound effects are added, such as tinun for the
zooming flight of the hummingbird or the whistle hwe::w for the
sound Jay makes in tricking Bear.         These tales are frequently
accompanied by expressive gestures, such as striking the hand on
the thigh and extending the arm forward to show in what way
Hummingbird set off. These gestures, unfortunately, cannot be
expressed easily on paper, and indeed some speakers do not use
gestures, perhaps partly because they lacked an audience at the
time of recording.    A goodly number of examples of literary
narrative were recorded, even though the form is not as common
gathered by Swanton in 1910, see Kimball
Instruction, or Didactic Narrative
   Didactic narrative, called olpind ‘instruction,’ is a relatively
common and culturally important kind of narrative, in which the
speaker makes moral observations about human behavior using as
a moral     foundation   the athémma          imolpiné   ‘Indian   Instruction,’
traditional Indian culture and behavior.      This form frequently
contrasts the moral lapses of the present with the ideals of the past:
for example, mutual aid, respect for elders, willingness to learn, and
obedience     to cultural   ideals.     The     boundary between        didactic
narrative and plain narrative, on the one hand, and oratory, on the
other is hard to define.          Plain narrative occasionally leads into
didactic narrative, and within didactic narrative some of the more
deeply felt passages rise to the oratorical level. Two excerpts from
an instruction will be given to illustrate this genre.
Aphorism
     An aphorism is a pithy phrase that succinctly describes a thing
or action. Although this form is not given a name, Koasati speakers
say in English that an aphorism “takes something all the way to the
end.” Only one speaker provided aphorisms, but because they were
so   many    and   tended    to    be   repeated    identically    on   different
 occasions, it seems they are an actual genre and not just the
 idiosyncratic productions of a highly fluent speaker.    Four
 aphorisms are given as examples of this speech style.
typical of Creek oratory, and because the Creek and the Koasati
are linked historically, it is likely that these passages are true
survivals of oratory.
    It is possible that oratory is preserved in the speech of the Indian
lay minister in his sermons, but he not only objects to having his
speech recorded but also believes that Koasati should not be taught
to non-Indians. Therefore, no examples of his sermonizing style
were recorded.’
   For examples of oratory, two'selections from different didactic
narratives are given.
Song
   This   obsolete   speech   style, ‘alilwa,   originally   accompanied
religious ceremonies and dances, was used in curing rituals, and
gave virtue to Indian medicine. With the Christianization of the
Koasati, song was suppressed. Some older people know dance and
curing songs, but they are not willing to convey them to others, at
least not to non-Indians. Five Koasati dance songs were recorded
by James Crawford from Azalie Langley (Indian name 4.sili, born
ca. 1883, died 1975). The only Koasati songs preserved, they are
musically complex, frequently covering a wide range of notes, with
complex rhythms and occasional changes in tempo. The Horse
Dance Song will be given as an example.
perhaps, a yarn. An elderly man, Kini,n
greet visitors with the jest, “Cokkéhlok, alcika:nasi mahcot a:tiks!”
“Sit down, and tell some kind of little alcika:na!”           This would make
his visitors laugh and put them at ease.

    This story has many of the traits of good Koasati narrative.
First, it is well plotted, moving directly from event to event.
Second, the emotional states of the characters are not stated, but
rather must be inferred from their words or actions, because a
person's emotional states are part of her or his alf-ya ‘interior life.’
In good narrative it is not permitted to speculate on a person’s
altzya. Words and actions are part of a person’s ali:ta ‘way of life,’
which, being observable, can be reported. Therefore, the wife’s
emotions on finding her husband’s horse with the saddle ruined are
not mentioned, but indicated by the fact that she hitches up the
horses quickly to go and search for him. Furthermore, after the
wife finds her husband, she finds someone else to continue on to
the church to spread the word, then disappears from the narrative,
presumably returning to her husband’s side. The emotions of the
churchgoers are not described, but indicated by the fact that they
all go off to try to help him.
   The structure and features of this text seem to be typical of
dramatic narratives and akin to thoseof literary narratives. In plain
narratives, where there is no thread of action running through the
narrative, the structure is much less tightly organized.
                          Literary Narrative
   The following example was taped from Bel Abbey. The symbol
[+] which occurs in the morphemic transcription indicates a pause
to take a breath.     Certain hesitations and errors, caused by
nervousness in the presence of the recorder, have been deleted.
""Well, as for that, 1 do not know exactly how they found them, but T will tell you.’

Conunentary
   This text is elaborately structured and has many of the typical
features of traditional narrative, especially successive restatement
of an idea, as in these lines:         kdaruik fskotik, amaléhkak tksoskan,
ati _nd:sok né:son       imacikthbo:s | nd:sok stimacthbalahokko:s |
ana;tohco:liskat, a:ti nésok amacikihbg { ‘But all the same,                   be it
drunk, because my relatives no longer exist, no one at all can feel
sorry about anything / Nothing will sadden anyone. / Because I have
been habitually alone, no one sorrows for me.’ Another major
feature in this text is the typicallly extensive use of quoted speech,
which adds interest and immediacy to traditional narrative, In fact,
quoted speech occurs in all examples of this genre gathered, even
highly abbreviated versions. This whole Nafrative, as mentioned
before, is highly elaborate, and could be divided into sections and
scenes and verses, as Dennis Tedlock (1972) and Del Hymes (1976,
1977, 1980) have done for literature from other American Indian
languages. Such a study has been done for the literary narrative
that Swanton called “The Pigeon Hawk's Gift” (retitled “Peregrine
Falcon and Great Horned Owl” by Kimball, 1989a).
    Didactic narratives as a gencral rule are Jong and can be difficult
to interpret. Therefore, rather than an entire instruction (which
would require lengthy annotations), two selections of one didactic
narrative are given. They were recorded on tape by Martha John;
in the morphemic transcription, the sign for a pause, [+], is not
given, because the pauses in her light and rapid delivery are less
significant than those in the speech of Mr. Abbey. This rapid, lenis
style of speaking is not usual, but is the result of nervousness and
self-consciousness in the presence of the tape recorder.

“Because we are coming along habitually mixed, as with white peoplic and such like,

   These two selections show typical features of didactic narrative,
One feature is the use of extremely long sentences.        Another
feature is their relative difficulty, as a great, deal of background
material is left implicit, rather than being set out, as in other kinds
of narrative. That difficulty, in addition to shift in the point of view
of the narrator from simply relating facts, to quoting specch, to
making   moral   observations,   makes   this spcech    style   the   most
opaque to the non-Indian listener. The one feature that didactic
narrative shares with other styles is the use of repetitive phrases
and structures, although repetition does not occur as often in
didactic narrative as in the other kinds of narrative.
    A feature of interest in the second example is the use of stress
as a supersegmental: andp amatlawistak ikséhcok ‘As for me, my
children do not exist.’ All Koasati words have a weak non-
phonemic stress on their penultimate syllables; however, when an
emphasis beyond that available in the morphological system is
needed, the stressed syllable is given extra loudness. A raise in
pitch is not used, as raising the pitch level on a word is a way of
making a verbless interrogative: A: té:nik mé:fa G21? B: té:ni?
A: [to:‘nik* ma:*fa* a?°ta*] B: [to:’ni°] A: ‘Is Tony there?’ B:
‘Tony?’ Furthermore, a phrase uttered at a higher pitch than
normal indicates that the speaker is upset or angry.

Commentary
   The transcription and translation of these selections has been
arranged to show the verse structure typical of oratorical pieces.
Repetition of ideas, seen in other kinds of nattative, is especially
notable here. In the second selection the verb ménkan — literally,
‘to tell to,’ but here with the leaning ‘to teach by word of mouth’ —
reinforces the lesson the oration is trying to convey by its constant
repetition.
    All oratorical selections so far noted are didactic. This is not
Surprising, since they are preserved in didactic narratives. However,
it is possible that oratory may have been always didactic.
Comparative studies of oratory in other Muskogean languages (see
Bell, 1979, 1983a, 1983b for studies on Creek oratory) will help to
elucidate the original nature of oratory in Koasati.
an old-time fecl to the narrative. Note that it is aot uscd consistently in the speech
of the person using il, as it would have been in real life.
    6. The switch in the order of the verbal suffixes here is remarkable, from the
expected hacikanmihinka:silahon (to the attested form hacikanmilahohénka:sin-
The reasons for this change are unclear, but it scems to be duc to verbalizing the
string hacikinmilaho- with the copular/emphatic suffix -o. Any word to which the
suffix -o is attached acts as a basc, and any suffix from positions 1 to 15 may follow.
     7. From this phrase to the end of the orphan’s speech, the audience would
laugh. Apparently the humor comes from the appreciation of tho naiveté of the
Indians on their first contact with alcohol.
     8. The verb aybéscin, whith is frequently rendered 'to forbid someone,’ has
the primary meaning ‘to instruct someone by means of admonitions; to inculcate
proper behavior in someone’ (withess the meaning of the verbal noun aybacitké
‘law').
     9. It is difficult to interpret this méxtohoskazlin. An clement -fi- following the
consoquential suffix -ska- is unknown, so this -fi- has been analyzed as the first
person singular subjcct suffix added to a verbalization of the sequence métoho-
ska-. ‘This interpretation is most uncertain.
   10, This last word was added as a humorous afterthought, and it madc other
listencrs laugh. A sudden switch in tonc in a narrative, such as the introduction of
a delicate subject like sex, death, or exerction is used to deliberately incite laughter.
Such humor is stroagly ironic,
   11. The initial syllables of the reciprocal prefixes itti- and itlim- are dropped
here, as they often are in rapid or casual speech.

An American Indian language belonging to the Muskogean linguistic family,
Koasati is spoken today by fewer than five hundred people living in south-
western Louisiana and on the Alabama-Coushatta Indian Reservation in
Texas. Geoffrey D. Kimball has collected material from the speakers of the
                                                                         ion of
larger Louisiana community to produce the first comprehensive descript
Koasati.
  ‘The book opens with a brief history of the Koasati. The chapters that follow
describe Koasati phonology, verb conjugation classes and inflectional mor-
phology, verb derivation, noun inflectional and derivational morphology,
grammatical particles, and syntax and semantics, A discussion of Koasati
                                                                        s of
speech styles illustrated with texts concludes the book. Because example

with the language since I finished the first version of this grammar
has led me, in revising it, only to enrich and improve my original
format, not to replace it. I would like to say again here what I said
in my previous work: for a virtually unknown language, a simple
description based on the categories inherent in the language itself
is better than one with a theoretical oricntation. Once a language
has been described adequately (and Iam not sure, even now, of the
adequacy of this grammar), then it can be used to test linguistic
theory.   But until such descriptive work is done, any theoretical
work based on a superficial knowledge with such an unknown
language is suspect.
   I have seen the previous version of my grammar treasured, but
not read, by the Koasati-speaking people to whom I have given it.
I hope that this time, in this improved format, they will take the
lime to puzzle through the rather academic English to see the
beauty, clarity, and the interest that I found in their language.
  For other linguists, to whom this work is addressed, I trust that
it will serve as a useful reference grammar of Koasati. A dictionary
of Koasati is in preparation at the present time; it too should serve
for reference use. But I would encourage linguists not only to pay
attention to the syntactic mechanisms of the language but also to
read what the examples say; for many of them were chosen
specifically for their instructive value. I have written elsewhere that
the motivations of certain Koasati speakers for working with me
were not the same as my own. I was interested in learning Koasati;
they were interested in teaching me about proper living, using
Koasati as a medium of instruction. Therefore, because I was
instructed, I wish to instruct in my turn.
Raymond J, DeMallie. I would never have considered revising this
work for publication without their interest and support. My original
grammar was written with the help of many Koasati-speaking
people, who deserve to be thanked again. These people are:

The revision of this grammar has been accomplished with the
additional help of Bel Abbey, Martha John, and Ruth Poncho.
  Once again I must thank Bel Abbey.          Not only is he a very
intelligent man (educated in the Indian way and notin the Western
way), but he is patient, resourceful, and highly practical as well. It
has been primarily through his intercession that I have met and
been able to work with so many speakers of Koasati, and the
completeness of the grammar is due as much to his labor as it is to
mine.
                                                                     xi
Well
       Ruth Poncho
proud of her knowledge of esoteric words and
her extensive unwritten knowledge of the genealogies of the Koasati
back to the turn of the century. She is a formal, very moral
woman, brought up to the dictates of Indian civilization, and
disturbed by the erosion of traditional Indian morality under the
pressure of Western culture. Thus, she is an instructor. She lets
one know that individuals long ago were no more moral than they
are today but that their collective behavior was much better.
Although she appreciates the advances of Western technology (and,
in fact, gave me most of the terms for technological items), she
wishes that they did not have to come at the price of the old social
relationships.
   My interest in Koasati was kindled and stimulated by Thomas C.
Smith-Stark; 1 have further profited from discussions at Tulane
University with Victoria Bricker, Barbara Edmonson, and the late
Jack Fisher. The two people working on the Alabama language at
the University of North Texas, Heather Hardy and Timothy
Montler (who designed the font with which this work is printed),
have helped me, not only by what they have said, but in the work
they have done. Jack Martin has attempted to ensure that my
Creek examples are accurate. I also am grateful to John Baron of
the music department at Tulane University, who printed the music
text in chapter 21, using the Theme program developed by Mark
Lambert.
   Other persons with whom I have spoken, and who have helped
to clarify my thoughts, include Karen Booker and Robert Rankin
of the University of Kansas, David S. Rood of the University of
Colorado, and Michael] J. P. Nichols of the University of California,
Berkeley.
   Outside the academic community, Stephen L. Pearce has given
advice and encouragement almost from the beginning and provided
me with the space to work on this project. Other friends who have
possible by a grant      from   the Phillips Fund   of the American
Philosophical Society.    Finally, some material used in the revision
of the grammar was made possible by a grant from the National
Science Foundation for the Koasati Dictionary Project, BNS-
8719269.
  To all the above I again extend my deepest and most heartfelt
thanks.
