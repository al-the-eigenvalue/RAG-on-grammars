"       Finally there are a number of semantic distinctions that are diachronically and/orsynchronically built out of the negation morpheme in Chácobo. For instance, theconjectural seems to combine negative with interrogation. I dedicate a section to discussingthe negative and all modal categories that seem to be built out of the negation marker andsomething else. The markers of perspectival semantics are summarized in Table 13.1.",[1047]

             5.2.3.10. Verb stratum 3 – Position 11Some functional morphemes can occur directly after the pleonastic wa (position 10) inbetween the V̄-constituent and the pronominal plural morpheme =kan (position 12). Thisis demonstrated in the following sentence in (5.124) where wa occurs because the verbphrase constituent is fronted.(5.124)          yoʂa       pistia    tsayá     tsi    ha      wa     =tɨkɨ(n)=ka(n)                 woman      small     see        P5     3       TR     =AGAIN=PL                 =ní=kɨ                 =REMP=DEC:P                 ‘They saw the young woman again.’ ELIC          Position 7 is a slot; only one morpheme can occur in this position at a time. All ofthe morphemes that can occur in this position can also occur in position 9 except one (=ʃina‘at night’). When the V̄-constituent is not fronted in position 2 it is impossible to tellwhether a morpheme is occupying position 9 of the verb phrase constituent or position 7of the clause, because there is no intervening morpheme that allows us to distinguishbetween these positions. For instance, in (5.125) it is not clear whether =tɨkɨn ‘again’ is inposition 4 inside the verb phrase constituent or position 7 of the clause. It is possible thatposition 7 is simply irrelevant for clauses where the verb phrase is not fronted.","[379, 380]"

In more advanced stages of research elicitation can be used to test specifichypotheses grammatical structure that emerge from text analysis. Following Matthewson(2004), I view careful elicitation as an important source of negative evidence. Furthermore,context-induced semantic elicitation can help reveal details of semantic structure thatcannot easily be inferred from text data. Literature on formal semantics have developed anumber of diagonistic tests for investigating semantic structure (Waldie et al. 2009; Bruil                                              24

"        To illustrate this idea consider the verb complex in (3.7). The verb complex in(3.7a) consists of four morphemes; a verb root atʃ ‘grab’; the three grammatical morphemes-a ‘transitive’; =má ‘causative’; =kɨ ‘declarative, past tense’ all display different degreesof contiguity with the verb root atʃ ‘grab’. The suffix -a ‘transitive’ is the most contiguousin that it can never be separated from the verb root by a free form. The enclitic =ma‘causative’ can be separated from the verb root by the free form negative marker. This isshown in (3.7b). This morpheme is not separable from the verb root by any constructs thatcan contain more than one free form (e.g. a verb complex or noun complex). However, theclause-type enclitic =kɨ ‘declarative, past tense’, can be separated from the verb root by anoun complex (subject), that contains more than one free form.

felicitous as in (13.103). This show that the direct evidence meaning associated with =ráis an implicature.(13.103)        kiriko=yá              tani                tʃani=kɨ=rá               hama                foreigner=COM           Tani                speak_with=DEC:P=ASS       but                toka              tsi          ɨ          tsaya=yáma=kɨ                like_so           P5           1SG        see=NEG=DEC:P                ‘Tani spoke with the foreigner (I assert), but I didn’t see this happen.’                ELIC        The assertive =rá can also combine with the reportative as in (13.104). A speakercan still mark themselves as having strong epistemic authority even when their evidence isfrom a second-hand source. The fact that the assertive can combine with the reportativeprovides further evidence against treating =rá as an evidential marker. In these sentencesthe assertive does not have scope over the reportative; the speaker is not vouching for thetruth of the fact that the proposition is said to be true, but rather that the proposition is true.(13.104)        tʃani=ʔikia=rá                speak=REP=ASS                ‘He spoke (to him) (it is said and I assert).’        ELIC

       The assertive =rá implies that the speaker vouches for the truth of the propositionat the time of the utterance.

       The reason that there are no examples of layered structures with =bɨkí in texts canbe attributed to the fact that =bɨkí is extremely rare in general (Section 8.9). However, allof my consultants accepted elicited examples such as those in (5.63) and (5.65) where bɨkícombines with another position 2 (verb stratum 2) morpheme       The clitic =bɨkí cannot be variably ordered with any morphemes in the verb stem(verb stratum 1). The causative morpheme =má is an exception in this regard. Myconsultants also reject sentences where the negation morpheme intervenes between theverb root and the passive suffix -ʔaká. This is captured in the current description by thefact that the negation morpheme does not appear in the verb stem (verb stratum 1).","[331, 332]"
"          14.2.8 Sympathetic yói
The morpheme yói is an adjective that means ‘ugly, poor’. It has all of the properties ofadjectives as described in Section 3.3.2: (i) it occurs right-adjacent to a noun it modifies;(ii) it can be verbalized with the morphemes -na ‘intransitive verbalizer’ and -wa ‘transitiveverbalizer / transitivizer’. It has a few properties that adjectives do not typically have. First,it can occur internal to the verb complex without necessarily taking on a clear adverbialfunction (see Section 5.2.3.9). Secondly, very frequently the morpheme does not describean attribute of a noun phrase referent per se. Rather it often expresses an emotional stateof the speaker often indicating that the speaker sympathesizes with one of the participantsof the discourse (see Ponsonnet 2018 for a broader typological perspective; see Guillaume

PLURAL PRONOMINAL ELEMENT =KA(N)The plural pronominal element is already introduced in the context of alignment in Chapter7 (Section 7.2.2). It is a piece of the plural subject pronoun ha … =kan where ha occurs inthe position of {A,S} arguments. The pronominal element =kán has a special distributionwith respect to the other pronouns in that it occurs in position 12 of the sentence in a verbalpredicate construction (see Section 5.2.3.11).62 In non-verbal predicate construction =ka(n)
62 As described in Chapter 7 pronouns have the same syntagmatic distribution as full NPs except that they
can occur clause-finally in subordinate clauses. Pronouns have an accusative alignment when they occurbefore the clause-type/rank morpheme (position 14 of the sentence). After the clause-type/rank morpheme                                                 1190

       The example in (5.57) demonstrates that the definition of the stem I have used doesnot result in perfect nesting between the layers. As is shown in §5.1.1.4 =ma ‘causative’ isa clitic. It can be interrupted by the free form negation morpheme yáma. However, thesuffix -ʔaká ‘passive’ cannot be interrupted by the negation morpheme yáma or any otherclitic apart from the causative clitic =má. Thus, a layer 2 clitic can interrupt a position 5suffix. I do not attribute any special theoretical or descriptive significance to this, since itonly shows that the division into stratum is arbitrary and done for organization purposes.","[320, 321]"

         Unlike affixes, clitics vary in terms of whether they incorporate into the high toneinsertion domain projected from the stem. In other words, some clitics block high toneinsertion and other clitics do not. Most of the clitics of the V̄-constituent (second verbstratum) incorporate into the high tone insertion domain. That clitics of this levelincorporate into the high tone domain of the verb stem is illustrated in the sentences in(6.56). For instance, hana ‘leave’ receives stress on its first syllable. High tone insertiondoes not map a high tone on the verb root, however, because =bɨkí ‘interactional’incorporates into the high tone insertion domain of the stem. High tone insertion does notapply because it only inserts a high tone if one is not present underlyingly.(6.56)    a.

"       Where a language is positioned on the analytic-(poly)synthetic continuum dependson a notion of word and/or how the linguist cuts the division between “morphological” and“syntactic” phenomena. I view much of the grammar of Chácobo as straddling theboundary between morphology and syntax such that a global distinction between wordsand phrases and morphology and syntax is perhaps unmotivated on language specificgrounds. Symptomatic of this type of profile, the grammar of Chácobo will be presentedas ubiquitously built out of clitics.",[75]

11 The minimum free form test is distinct from the test of pronounceability, which refers to the capacity of a
speaker to be able to assign some meaning to a segment in an utterance. It is currently not clear how to applythe test of pronounceability in a consistent fashion. It seems to depend heavily of the metalinguisticknowledge of the speaker. I have not found the criterion of pronounceability defended in any publishedwritings. Nevertheless I mention it here, because many linguists have told me that they use this criterion,even if it is never mentioned explicitly.",[158]
"         The morpheme =ʔá can be used in future time discourse. This is illustrated in(9.15a). The clause marked by =ʔá ‘nominalizer, anterior’ is embedded in a non-pastsentence marked by =ki in this sentence. In this sentence the =ʔá clause expresses a pastof the future (future perfect).",[772]
