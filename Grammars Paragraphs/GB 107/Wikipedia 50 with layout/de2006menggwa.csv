Positive realis and positive irrealis are indicated by zero morphs (but the tense-aspect-mood affixes for positive realis and positive irrealis moods are mutuallyexclusive); negative realis (§6.1.3) is conveyd by negative realis verb boke (class I)or -boka (class II); positive semi-realis (§6.2.1) is conveyd by the positive semi-realis verb samby or its bound form -mby/ -mb; negative-semi-realis (§6.2.2) isconveyd by a particle ga; and negative-irrealis (§6.3) is conveyd by an affix ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m.,[350]
"       There is no affix marking positive irrealis specifically. The positive irrealisverb forms have the following morphological structure (the prohibitive mood verbsare never in positive polarity):       FINITE VERB STEM — CROSS REF SUFFIX(ES) — TM SUFFIX
       Formally, the negative irrealis verbs differ from the positive irrealis verbs byhaving an extra negative irrealis affix which is affixed to the verb stem. Thenegative realis affix has the form of ma-, -ma, -me or -m. The negative realis affixis always ma- when affixed to non-finite verb stems (§5.1.1). For finite verb stems,the regular allomorphy of the negative irrealis affix is as follows:   •   -ma is suffixed to class IIB, class II or class III verb stems.   •   ma- is prefixed to consonant ending class I or class IH verb stems;   •   -me is suffixed to vowel ending class I verb stems, except that when the       following class IB cross-reference suffix begins with a, the negative irrealis       suffix becomes -m.",[393]

6.2    Semi-
       Semi-realis status       Semi-realis status encompasses only one tense-mood category — futuredeclarative (other future categories are irrealis; §6.3). Future declarative verbs ofpositive and negative polarities have markedly different morphological forms:positive semi-realis verbs are characterised by a serialised ‘positive semi-realis verb’

samby (class I) (§6.2.1), whereas negative semi-realis verbs have a negative semi-realis particle ga (§6.2.2). Finite verb stems are used for semi-realis verb forms(§5.1.1), and if the lexical verb lexeme makes a distinction between future versusnon-future finite verb stems (§5.1.2), the future form must be used. The form of thepositive semi-realis verb varies greatly depending on the person-number-genderfeatures of the subject, and it is difficult to give a general morphological template ofpositive semi-realis verbs. In some cases the positive semi-realis verb forms aseparate phonological word from the lexical verb, and in other cases the positivesemi-realis verb forms a phonological word together with the lexical verb (see§6.2.1). On the other hand, negative semi-realis verbs are morphologically simple incomparison. Negative semi-realis verb forms begin with a negative semi-realisparticle ga and then followed by a (future) finite verb stem (§5.1.1-2) together withits cross-reference suffix(es). The cross-reference suffixes used in negative semi-realis verb forms are always class A suffixes (§5.2).

"       Independent verbs carry cross-reference suffixes (§5.2) and other affixeswhich indicate tense, mood, status, polarity, and sometimes aspect (§6). There arethree tenses: past, present and future. Three statuses are distinguished: realis (§6.1),semi-realis (‘certain future’; §6.2) and irrealis (§6.3). Morphology associated withthe three statuses is markedly different, especially the way negatives are formed(negativity is independent from status in Menggwa Dla; §6.1.3, §6.2.2, §6.3).",[22]
"       The negative form of a DR chain verb is formed by serialising a negative verbboke (class I) or boka (class II) in DR chain verb form to a non-finite form of thelexical verb; class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs take boke (which takes class I cross-reference suffixes), whereas class II and III lexical verbs take boka (which takesclass II cross-reference suffixes). This is formally the same as the negative realisverb boke/ boka used in independent clauses (§5.1.3). Nevertheless, the chain clausenegative verb boke/ boka does not indicate status, unlike the independent clausenegative realis verb boke/ boka which indicates realis status. The following areexamples of positive CR chain verbs, positive DR chain verbs and negative DR chainverbs in different verb classes. Notice the changes in the cross-reference suffixes,especially when the negative verb boke (class I)/ boka (class II) is used.

Near present timerefers to immediate past time or immediate future time, in other words time which isconsidered by the speaker to be near the present time, typically no more than a fewminutes away from the present time. Correspondingly, past tense and future tenseconvey non-immediate past time and non-immediate future time respectively. If theprogression of time is represented by a horizontal line running from left to right, andthe time of utterance by an × on the horizontal time line, this is how the tenses inMenggwa Dla dissect the time line:

6.1.3   Negative realis verb boke and boka        A negative realis independent clause is formed by the lexical verb in its non-finite form (§5.1.1) followed by a negative realis verb boke (class I) or boka (classII). Whether boke or boka is used depends on the verb class membership (§5.2) ofthe lexical verb: for class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs, boke (class I) is used; for classII and III lexical verbs, boka (class II) is used. Class IH, IIB and III lexical verbshave mismatching classes of cross-reference suffixes between positive and negativerealis verb forms: in positive realis, the finite lexical verb stem itself controls theclass membership of the cross-reference suffixes; in negative realis, it is the negativerealis verb boke (class I) or boka (class II) which controls the membership of thecross-reference suffixes. The following table summarises the class of cross-reference suffix used in positive realis verb form versus negative realis verb form.","[370, 371]"

7.1.2.1          Realis -hwani ‘when’ clauses          A realis -hwani verb has a (non-future) finite verb stem (§5.1.1-2), subset Across-reference suffix(es) (§5.2), and a -hwani ‘when’ suffix at the end. With realis-hwani clauses, the situation is known by the speaker as having occurred (positivepolarity) or not occurred (negative polarity), or habitually occurring (positive) orhabitually not occurring (negative), and the situation of the matrix clause beginsafter the inchoation point of the situation of the -hwani clause. The use ofsubordinate realis -hwani clauses is rather rare, for that sequential meaning is mostlyconveyed by chain clauses (§7.2). A realis -hwani clause is used as the final clauseof a non-finite clause chain or when it is followed by non-finite chain clauses (andnon-finite chain clauses themselves are rather rare; §7.3.1). In a non-finite chainclause, the subject must be coreferential with the subject of the following clause inthe clause chain. On the other hand, the subject of a -hwani clause must be disjoint-referential with the subject of its matrix clause. In effect, a non-finite chain verband a realis -hwani verb is the coreferential (CR) and disjoint-referential (DR) verbforms — respectively — of a switch-reference (SR) system. Nevertheless, this non-finite/ -hwani SR system is used much less often than the chain clause SR system.","[448, 449]"
"Usually, the DR affix comes in the form of ma-, -ma or -me. The DR morph has thesame allomorphy as the negative irrealis affix (§6.3).11 However, some verblexemes have irregular DR chain verb forms and/or irregular negative irrealis verb11
  There is also an -m allomorph of the negative irrealis affix. However, -m is only used when

"       Other than having defective paradigms (as they cannot have object cross-reference suffixes other than -a (3FSG:O)), these monovalent class IIB verbs have thesame formation as other class IIB verbs. Most importantly, these monovalenttransitive class IIB verb lexemes form the realis negative form in the same manner asother bivalent class IIB verb lexemes. The realis negative form of class IIB verblexemes are formed with the lexical verb lexeme in its non-finite verb form followedby the realis negative verb boke (class I).

Chain verbs which indicatecoreference of subjects between clauses are called CR chain verbs, and chain verbswhich indicate disjoint-reference of subjects between clauses are called DR chainverbs. There are a number of morphosyntactic differences between CR chain verbsand DR chain verbs: a) CR chain verbs have a zero CR morph, whereas DR chainverbs have a ma-/ -ma or -me DR affix; b) CR chain verbs carry subset B cross-referencing (§5.2), whereas DR chain verbs carry subset A cross-referencing, with theexception of class IIB verbs which must take subset B cross-referencing regardless(§5.2.2); c) CR chain verbs must be in positive in polarity, whereas DR chain verbscan be in positive or negative polarity;10 d) CR chain verbs can be serialised with thecompletive verb fefi (fa-) ~ mefi (ma-)/ me and the sequential verb nuŋgu(nu[mb/ŋg]-) (§7.4), whereas DR chain verbs cannot be serialised with these verbs;10

One salient feature is that most realis tense-aspect suffixes havecase clitic counterparts; it is most likely that these realis tense-aspect weregrammaticalised from the case clitics. Cross-linguistically it is not uncommon tohave tense-aspect-mood markers grammaticalised from case markings (e.g. Blake2001:180-131). One transparent example is from Kalaw Lagaw Ya (a dialect of theWestern Torres Strait language) where pratically the whole set of case suffixes arealso used on verbs to indicate tense or asepct (Kennedy 1984). Aikhenvald (2005)mentions that in Manambu (a Ndu language spoken in East Sepik Province in PapuaNew Guinea) and a wide range of other languages in her survey that case markersare often used with dependent clauses (often at the edge of the clause) to indicatevarious dependent relationships. These dependent clauses may be reanalysed asindependent clauses (‘desubordination’), and the case markers may be reanalysed asverbal tense-aspect-mood affixes. This is also likely the path of grammaticalisationof most of the realis tense-aspect suffixes in Menggwa Dla (except -hwa; see below);it is likely that the relative clauses (§7.1.1) were reanalysed as independent clauses,maybe through a stage of ‘obligatory’ cleft constructions. Amongst the four realistense-aspect suffixes (see table 6.4 below), -mbi, -hi and -hya are the ones which canbe used on relative clause verbs (§7.1.1); these are also the ones which have
                                           339
corresponding case clitic forms. The remaining past tense suffix -hwa cannot beused on any dependent verbs, and -hwa is also the only realise tense-aspect suffixwhich does not have a corresponding case clitic form. The following table lists therealis suffixes and the corresponding case clitics.","[352, 353, 354]"

"        Independent verbs are grammatically marked for status1, tense, aspect, moodand/or polarity. In terms of verbal morphology, the most important categories arestatus and polarity (polarity is independent of status in Menggwa Dla), as the overallmorphological structure of a verb is determined first by its status and polarity. A lotof languages have a binary realis-irrealis status distinction; Mithun (1999:173)generalises the binary status distinction as follows: ‘The realis portrays situations asactualized, as having occurred or actually occurring, knowable through directperception. The irrealis portrays situations as purely within the realm of thought,knowable only through imagination’. In addition to realis status and irrealis status,there is also an in-between status category called ‘semi-realis’ in Menggwa Dla,which signifies that on one hand it is like irrealis in that the situation is imagined,but on the other hand it is like realis in that the speaker is conveying his/ hercertainty over the realisation (positive future declarative) or non-realisation (negativefuture declarative) of the situation.",[349]

Hypothetical protasis often have counterfactual apodoseswhich carries the -naho counterfactual suffix (see §6.3.4 for more examples). Thefollowing exemplifies some hypothetical protases.7-138. hwahwa-Ø-a-mbona, wanu ma-sa-ŋga-u-naho.        know-CR-1SG-DEP         money NEG:IR-give-1SG-3SG:O-CNTR        ‘If I had known, I would not have given him/her the money.’        (hwahwa ‘know’ class I, sefi (sa-/ da-) ‘give’ class III)

Polarity questions are mostly answered simply with ini ‘yes’ or awe ‘no’ (§3.2.9).,[369]
"6.4.1   Copulas        Copula is a special class of verb in Menggwa Dla. Like other verbs, copulasalso have finite forms which carry cross-referencing and non-finite forms which donot. However, as the main verb of a clause, finite copulas only head independentclauses (§6), and the non-finite copulas only head non-finite chain clauses (§7.3.2)(copulas are not used as the main verb of subordinate clauses (§7.1) and chainclauses (§7.2); see also §6.4.3 on auxiliary copulas). Moreover, finite copulas markless tense-aspect-mood categories than ordinary verbs, and the way tense-aspect-mood-polarity categories are expressed in copulas is also mostly different from thosein ordinary verbs (§6.1-3). The following table summarises the copulas in MenggwaDla; the copulas are introduced in the listed order in the rest of this section.",[408]

3.2.9   Interjections, greeting phrases and miscellaneous would classes        Interjections are words which are semantically not related to the rest of theutterance. All of the following words except hya can form utterances on their own.        a              ‘ah’        o              ‘oh’        wu             ‘oh’        hya            INTJ        yambi          ‘OK’ (example 3-160 below)        ai             ‘ai!’ (exclamation of surprise/ accidents/ forgetfulness)        ini            ‘yes’        awe            ‘no’        The interjection a ‘ah’ can be used utterance initially (example 3-144 below)or medially (example 3-75 above), o ‘oh’ is used utterance-initially (example 3-102above), and wu ‘oh’ is used utterance-medially (example 3-145 below).3-144. a      yanu.        ah enough        ‘Ah, (that is) enough.’ (N)
                                          179
3-145. ye      bani safa aflambe wu ma-ek-wa-mbo,       then sago meat plenty        oh DR-exist-3FSG-DEP       ‘Then there would be a big pile of sago starch, and…’ (B)       The interjection hya — homophonous with the ablative case clitic =hya(§4.5.3) — is a frequently used space filler which is used after noun phrases ordirect quotes.3-146. ahala=na=pa         hya      imbu safo tamako=nambo kikifi nuŋgu-mbo,       root=ALL=only INTJ           two   half axe=ALL           chop SEQ-DEP       ‘People chop (the trunk) into two halves along the length of the trunk (‘only       to the root’), and…’ (B)3-147. yaplu            hya      Ø-numb-a-mbo,       coconut.stalk INTJ        CR-stand-1SG-DEP       ‘I put the coconut stalk up, and…’ (B)3-148. wara rani hya rani sa-ya-a                pi-Ø-Ø-mbo,       so        that INTJ that take-3SG-3FSG:O go-CR-3MSG-DEP       ‘so then he took it away, and…’ (A)3-149. “ naho ni”       hya hya tutu-Ø-ni           gwa,         what      TENT INTJ INTJ ask-3MSG-TENT but       ‘maybe he asked (them) “what is it”, but’ (A)
                                           180
       Other than forming utterances on their own, the words ini ‘yes’ and awe ‘no’can also be followed by gwa ‘but’ (§3.2.6), the exclamatory particle ke or thecautionary particle we (see below)). The word ini ‘yes’ is used to indicateagreement or existence (ini ‘yes’ is used in agreement with a negatively-polarisedquestion), whereas awe ‘no’ is used to indicate non-agreement or non-existence (inexample 3-151 below, awe ‘no’ signifies non-existence rather than non-agreement toa statement raised by someone).3-150. “ga        po-l-afa?”                “ini, (ga       po-l-aha.)”       “NEG:SMR go:FUT-LIG-2SG”             “yes (NEG:SMR go:FUT-LIG-1SG)”       “You will not go?” “Yes, (I will not go.)”3-151. awe, munika hof-ehye-mbi.       no    nothing come-1DU-PRES       ‘No, we are coming back with nothing.’ (N)       In addition, awe ‘no’ can also be used in an independent clause as a predicatemeaning ‘be not’. Unlike verbs, the predicate awe is not inflected, and unlike nouns,awe cannot be followed by a copula.3-152. awe, ai=na dani=hya awe.       no    3=TOP here=ABL be.not       ‘No, s/he is not from here.’
                                         181
3-153. bohoni amamo=na sini=mbe akani=mbe=na awe.        before moon=TOP sky=INS                 there=INS=TOP be.not        ‘Once upon a time the moon was not there in the sky.’        (repeated from example 3-107 above; A)        Another invariant predicate is the word hwambo ‘be the case’. Thefollowing example shows that hwambo can take an object argument. The phraseimbumamo waplumbi ekwahya is a zero-headed relative clause (§7.1.1.3): -hya isthe only past tense suffix available to relative clauses, and the only mbo morphwhich can follow -hya is the object case clitic =mbo (§4.5.2).283-154. [imbumamo waplu=mbi                ek-wa-hya]=mbo              hwambo        [three          bucket=PROP exist-3FSG-PAST]=OBJ be.the.case        pi-Ø-a-Ø,        go-CR-1SG-DEP        ‘With there being three buckets I go, and…’ (B)The following is another example of hwambo; the object case clitic =mbo is notobligatorily used in Menggwa Dla (§4.5.1).","[193, 194, 195, 196]"

We have seen that future declaratives are expressed by semi-realis verb forms(§6.2). Future interrogatives, however, must be in irrealis status. The futuretentative verb form is used for both content questions (question word questions) andpolarity questions (yes-no questions). The following are some examples of contentquestions in future tense.6-150. dani=hya=na            ga=na           po-ma-afu?          here=ABL=TOP where=ALL go:FUT-NEG:IR-2SG          ‘From here where will you go?’ (pi (pi-/ po-) ‘go’ class I; -afu class IB)6-151. nahombo kaha-ma-wa-a?          why        chop-NEG:IR-2SG-3FSG:O          ‘Why will you chop it down?’          (kahefi (kaha-) ‘chop standing things’ class IIB; -wa-a class IIB)6-152. nuŋgwi         bli-ma-ha-a?          how.many buy-NEG:IR-1SG-3FSG:O          ‘How many should I buy?’ (bli ‘buy’ class II; -ha class IIA, -a class IIB)                                              390

2.4.2    Word pitch and clausal intonation         The pitch pattern of a word is not always predictable. However, somegeneralisations can be made about word pitch and clausal intonation. In this section,high pitch is abbreviated as H, mid pitch is abbreviated as M, and low pitch isabbreviated as L. Contour pitches are analysed as a combination of the simple levelpitches.22         Words uttered in isolation tend to have a H level or falling (HM/ HL) pitchpattern if the word is monosyllabic, HL pitch pattern if the word is disyllabic, andM…HL pitch pattern for words with three or more syllables.23 This correspondswith stressed syllables having a H pitch.","[129, 130, 131, 132]"

5.1.2   Finite verb stems: non-future versus future        Most verb lexemes have only one finite verb stem which is used in allenvironments where a finite verb stem is required (§5.1.1). The following areexamples of the verb apu (ap-) ‘sleep’ (class I) in past tense (§6.1.2), present tensecontinuous aspect (§6.1.1) and future tense (§6.2). The finite verb stem remainsinvariant for apu (ap-) ‘sleep’ (class I) and most other verb lexemes.","[275, 276]"
