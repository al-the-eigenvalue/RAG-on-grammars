                                         IntroductionIn the Caning language there are different types of words: nouns, verbs, prepositions,
pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and connectors. We will learn about these in this book. We will
also learn about how the words go together into groups of words called phrases, clauses, and
sentences. The words and how they go together are called grammar.","[3, 4]"

sign to compare one noun with another, to identify a nearby or recently mentioned noun, or to
show the end of a relative clause. Locating near suffixes can also be on verbs to show the
action is near the speaker.",[191]
"Identifying suffixes4 can be an equal sign in a sentence without a verb. In this way they help
identify or tell information about certain nouns. They can show the end of an identifying
relative clause (a group of words with a verb that tells which noun we are talking about). They
can also show a clause depends on another clause to make a complete sentence. They can also
show the end of a phrase (group of words without a verb) that is in focus, the most important
words of the sentence.",[85]

differences in meaning or the way the verb is used.","[127, 128]"

general meaning of ‘some people’. When this subject prefix has this meaning, it is as if the
verb is done by an unmentioned subject, which is like a passive verb in other languages.",[177]

"                                         Verbal nounsVerbal nouns are verbs that are used as nouns. They can be introduced by prepositions,
possessed, the object of a verb, or used in other ways as nouns. Most verbal nouns only have a
plural form which takes plural suffixes, but a few have both a singular and plural form. Many
verbal nouns have the suffixes –ad, ed, -id or -d, but some verbal nouns are without any suffix,
and are the same as the verb root.",[172]
"The identifying suffix –ng is on the preposition and pronoun taging ‘to you’ in the relative
clause. However, it is used to show the larger clause i näs ceza cadogäng taging ‘if she who
gave it to you’ depends on the following words inorder to be a complete sentence.",[121]
"Exercise 19In the following sentences, underline all locating near suffixes on nouns and pronouns.",[93]
"The chart below has other verbs with changes in the first consonant when there are also

underlined words in (1-5) above or in similar sentences.",[155]
"In (AKT 16) the identifying suffix –ang on the verb kawungang ‘came’ shows the clause Ka
nox Tumos kawungang ‘if you see elephant come’ depends on the following words to make a
complete sentence. These words cannot be a sentence by themselves.",[190]
"In (Nyax 71), the suffix –kanang shows the words nyämändäs nganag ‘he asked elder sisters’
tell which mäned ‘asking’ we are talking about. This locating near suffix comes at the end of
this identifying relative clause.",[91]
"It is most common for plural complement suffixes to begin with –a-. However, plural
complement suffixes can instead begin with –ta- when the final root letter is d, -ka- when the
final root letter is g, -wa- when the final root letter is u or o, and -ya- when the final root letter
is i or e. Plural complement suffixes can be without a beginning consonant and a when the final

  Boyeldieu, Pascal (2009) in Afrika und Übersee, 90:9-84 considers all these noun forms to be unmodified and
without suffixes. That is, the various copulas are all separate words. However, since speakers do not think of these
copulas as separate words, and because there is some morpholophonology to support them as being bound to nouns,
this book presents them as bound (probably they are enclitics similar to the enclitic copulas of Gaahmg, another
Eastern Sudanic language.).",[51]

  Boyeldieu, Pascal (2009) in Afrika und Übersee, 90:9-84 speaks of the noun unmodified form such as nyang
‘crocodile’ and the noun modified form such as nyangz- which includes the consonant z in this noun, but would
include other consonants for other nouns. In this way, the morphology is simplified a great deal. However, it
remains to be seen if Caning speakers think of the noun in this way since the ‘modified form’ of the noun is never
without a suffix. That is, it is not possible to say nyangz without adding additional segments. Thus, this book does
not compare modified with unmodified forms of nouns, and instead presents the morphology in a way that is
perhaps closer to the mind of the speaker.",[49]
"Pointing near suffixes point to a noun near the speaker. In stories, the pointing near suffix is
nearly always used in speeches.",[55]
"A pointing far suffix on a noun can also be used to introduce an identifying relative clause (a
group of words with a verb that is used to show which noun we are talking about).",[60]
