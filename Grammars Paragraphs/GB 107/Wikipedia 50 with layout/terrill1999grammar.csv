"There are various ways to negate different kinds of constituents: including the Negative
verbal suffix -la, the particle tamu ÔnoÕ; the intransitive verb tave Ôbe notÕ; the negative
imperative expressed by the Admonitive suffix; and other negative lexical items.
Frequently, negative predications are expressed using a focus construction. The use of
focus constructions in the areas of questions and negation is a very characteristic feature
of Lavukaleve, and indeed of other languages which have grammaticalised focus
structures.",[433]
"The first part of this chapter discusses the syntactic structures used to express questions,
and also all the interrogative lexical items in the language. It also discusses how positive
and negative polar questions are answered. The second part of the chapter presents a
discussion of all aspects of negation, including the role of the focus markers in negative
clauses. The morphological, syntactic and pragmatic features of focus constructions are
discussed in Chapter 11.",[433]
"
17.1.2 A NSWERS TO POLAR QUESTIONSPolar questions can be phrased both positively and negatively, as the examples above
have shown. Positive answers to positive polar questions are expressed by iire ÔyesÕ.
Negative answers to positive questions are expressed by tamu ÔnoÕ. The particle comes
first, in its own sentence intonation unit, then a longer sentential answer may follow.
For example the answer to the question in (2) Is it here you want to stay? is as follows:
                                                   409

answer. However questions phrased negatively expect a positive answer. For example
the question in (4) above The giant here didnÕt eat you? was asked when a boy
reappeared in his village after a long absence. The village people had assumed he had
been eaten by the giant, but seeing him they realised he must not have been, and thus
asked the question knowing that it would receive a positive answer: the giant had not
eaten him. The boyÕs answer is as follows:7)     Tamu.     Ngaulam                         fin.

negative particle.","[435, 436]"

                                           17 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATION17.2 NEGATIONThere are a number of means by which a word or a clause can be negated. Verbs can be
negated using the verbal suffix -la, which usually, but not necessarily, involves a focus
construction. NPs can be negated using the adjective ro ÔoneÕ, with its negative suffix
-ru to mean Ônot oneÕ. Adjectives and whole propositions can be negated using the
intransitive verb tave Ôbe notÕ. An entire proposition or an NP can be negated using the
particle tamu ÔnotÕ. A negative command can be given, using the Admonitive verbal
suffix -n. In addition there are various lexical items which have a negative meaning.
The syntax and semantics of these methods of negation will be discussed. The method
of expressing not wanting, while not actually a syntactically negative construction,
nonetheless belongs in this semantic area, and is also discussed below.","[441, 442]"
"Even though negative questions expect a positive answer, it is possible to give a
negative answer to a negative question. This is done using a particle oman Ôon the
contraryÕ. A negative answer to the above question (Q: The giant didnÕt eat you? A:
The giant ate me (which would only make sense if the boy was now a ghost for
example)) could be expressed in the following way, using oman and a positive
sentence:8)     Oman.             Bagatum            na     oum                fongai.
       oman              bagatum            na     o-        u   -m   fongai

       On the contrary, the giant did eat me.                                      e4 018a
17.1.3 CONTENT QUESTIONS USING THE HEO FOCUS MARKERContent questions are those which expect a content word or words as an answer. It was
shown in Section 11.7 that if a content question employs a focus construction, the focus
marker used will be the heo focus marker. The heo focus marker in questions works as
in focus constructions, but the element it is questioning is the element it expresses focus
on, using the agreement system outlined in Chapter 11.",[436]
"These restrictions mean that the verbs of many construction types cannot be negated
directly. Instead, multi-verb constructions are used, such that verbal morphology
appears on a different verb from that which the Negative suffix appears on.
Alternatively, other kinds of negation apart from the Negative suffix can be used.",[443]
"
17.2.4 TAMU ÔNOTÕThe particle tamu negates an entire clause or an NP. It appears postposed to a positive
clause and negates the proposition of that clause, or, as discussed above, it provides an
answer to a negative question. The difference between using a tamu construction and
using the verbal suffix -la or tave Ôbe notÕ, which have the same propositional effect,

                                            17 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATIONappears to be a stylistic one; in texts, particular speakers tend to favour one or the other.","[445, 446]"
"
NEGATIVE IMPERATIVEThe negative imperative use of the suffix commands the hearer not to carry out the
action of the verb. There is no necessary implication that bad results will follow if the
hearer ignores the command. The admonitive in the negative imperative meaning is
often accompanied by sevo, a particle meaning Ôtabu/holyÕ, which can also be used by
itself to tell someone to stop doing whatever it is they are doing.",[334]
"For example, the following construction type is commonly used for future negation. The
lexical verb carries the Negative suffix, and the Habitual Auxiliary carries the Future
Tense suffix:

using two verbs can be used. In the following example, the first verb carries the
negative suffix and the second creates Present tense meaning:38)     Kini         minamina                  okovelam                             olei?

A tave construction may be used to negate a clause.","[443, 444]"
"The next four examples are negative Sentence-Final focus constructions, in which the
focus marker always shows subject agreement (i.e. sentence focus) in Lavukaleve. This
represents a grammaticalisation of the pragmatic functions of the focus marker in negative
constructions. In negative focussed sentences, the focus marker is no longer signalling a
pragmatic choice of focus marking; instead the focus marker has become obligatory, and
the pragmatic function is lost:                                                 261

object with a negative Sentence-Final focus construction. For example, (30) above, The
man didnÕt see the woman, using subject agreement, would also be used as the way to
express It was the woman that the man didnÕt see. That is, there is no grammatical
construction for expressing focus on an object in a negative sentence focus construction.
Similarly, there is no grammatical construction for expressing focus on a subject in a
negative sentence focus construction (It was the man who didnÕt see the woman).","[287, 288]"

possible to mark predicate focus in negative clauses. Negation is discussed in general in
Section 17.2, and with particular reference to focus constructions in Section 11.3.2.","[262, 263]"
"It was explained in Chapter 11 that all verbal predications, negated or otherwise, may
appear in a focus construction, with the type of focus being shown by means of which
core participant is indexed with the Agreement Suffix and the focus marker. In all
transitive non-negative predication types in which there is a focus marker immediately
following the verb, the speaker may choose whether the Agreement Suffix and focus
marker will agree with the subject or object of the verb; the choice depends on what
type of focus the speaker wishes to express; either sentence focus or predicate focus. In
negated clauses, however, there is no choice: the Agreement Suffix and focus marker
must obligatorily agree with the subject of the verb (in positive sentences this agreement
system would mark sentence focus).",[442]
"The word me, suffixed with the Future Tense marker -re, plus the Agreement Suffix, is
used with negated verbs to express negative habitual-state meanings3. The resulting
construction differs from the construction discussed above only in that the auxiliary me
is always suffixed with the Future Tense marker -re in these constructions, and the

    There are also four positive examples of this construction in a corpus of around 5000 sentences.",[382]
"
17.2.1 THE VERBAL SUFFIX -LAThe verbal suffix -la (glossed NEG) is used to negate a verb. It co-occurs with little
other verbal morphology: only an object prefix if the verb is transitive, the Causative
suffix (which precedes it) and the Agreement Suffix (which follows it). Negative
expressions involving the negative suffix -la are almost always expressed in focus
constructions. This is a stylistic rather than obligatory syntactic matter, but nevertheless
it is unusual to see a negated verb not in a focus construction.",[442]
"
17.2.3 RO-RU ÔNOT ONEÕThe suffix -ru only appears on the adjective ro (cited here in its feminine singular
form). Ro means ÔoneÕ; ro-ru means Ônot oneÕ. The suffixed ro word is used to negate a
noun. It very frequently negates mina ÔthingÕ; thus mina roru ÔnothingÕ. A clause
containing an NP negated with ro-ru must appear with a further clausal negator. Thus,
if the clause is verbal, the verb must be negated using verbal suffix -la. If the clause is
non-verbal, it must be negated with the negative particle tamu ÔnotÕ.",[445]

predicate (and on the focus marker), as per Principle 4.","[253, 254]"

3.17.4 QUANTIFIER PARTICLESThere are only two quantifier particles; suni ÔallÕ and mail Ôa bitÕ. Other concepts from
this semantic area are expressed by words of other word classes, e.g. vutia Ôbe manyÕ
(intransitive verb); ro-ru ÔnoneÕ (adjective ro ÔoneÕ with negative suffix); fatu ÔhalfÕ
(noun); viluril ÔmostÕ (derived verb); and fan ÔsomeÕ (noun). They function as adjuncts
of verbs.",[88]

INTRANSITIVE CLAUSESIntransitive clause constructions always show agreement with the subject. Thus, in the
terms in which transitive clauses have been analysed, intransitive Sentence-Final focus
constructions all show sentence focus. It is not possible for such sentences to show
predicate focus, as there is no object NP for the focus marker to agree with. Some
examples:

NON-VERBAL CLAUSESNon-verbal clauses function in this respect similarly to verbal clauses. The focus marker
in non-verbal Sentence-Final focus constructions can in theory agree with either of the
two NPs that may be present, although in practice it is very difficult to find an example
showing the focus marker agreeing with one NP but not the other, because the
complement in almost all cases is the item of equation or identification with the subject,
and thus they both have the same agreement properties. Therefore, sentence focus and
predicate focus are distinguished in two-NP non-verbal clauses, but in practice often the
difference cannot be seen. There are some examples however which are clear:Agreement with subject:

verbal clause, there are two frequently used strategies. Speakers usually either change the
construction and use a verb with a negative meaning in the focus marker clause (thus, not
using a non-verbal clause) (e.g. 40), or use a non-verbal clause with the negative particle
tamu ÔNEGÕ, but no focus marker (e.g. 41). The focus marker does not normally co-
occur with the negative particle.","[288, 289, 290]"

Lavukaleve (see Chapter 11 and Section 17.2).","[383, 384]"
"Sentence focus is a pragmatically (and distributionally) very highly marked focus
construction. In Lavukaleve it is used for situations involving very strong, often
contrastive focus. All negative Sentence-Final focus constructions take this form too.
Lambrecht points out that sentence-focus constructions are usually used for presentational
sentences involving all-new information. ÔPresentationalÕ, refers to structures that Òare
used to introduce an NP referent, or the concept associated with some NP, into the
universe of discourseÓ (1987: 375). Such sentences have also been referred to as thetic
(e.g. Lambrecht 1987. Note though, that Sasse (1987) expresses unease at such a
correlation of thetic utterances with sentences involving focus on the entire statement.)For Lambrecht, Ò[Sentence focus] structures express propositions in which the assertion
extends over the entire proposition, they exhibit a certain Òall-newÓ character which
distinguishes them from [predicate focus] structuresÓ (1987: 379). This all-newness of
presentational, sentence focus structures also, in many languages, becomes associated
with situations involving unexpected or surprising information: ÒThe less the cognitive
status of the NP referent warrants the use of the [sentence focus] structure, the more the
construction will give rise to the implicature that the piece of information expressed in the
[sentence focus] structure is of special importanceÓ (1987: 379). These types of pragmatic
functions are indeed present in Lavukaleve sentence-focus constructions.",[291]
"The scope of morphology in serial verb constructions is not negotiable: in all serial verb
constructions without lei ÔexistÕ, non-participant marking verbal morphology appears on
the final verb and obligatorily has scope over the whole serial verb construction. It is
only with serial verb constructions with lei as the second member that the Negative
suffix appears on the first not the last verb, and is not possible for the Negative suffix to
appear on the last, lei verb. Note that the Negative suffix is the only non-participant
verbal morphology found on serial verb constructions with lei in the corpus. It is not
known whether other non-participant verbal morphology would appear on the first or
last verb of serial verb constructions with lei.",[370]

CHAPTER FIVE
Noun formation
Verbal inflectional processes in Lavukaleve are remarkably regular; all verb stems are
completely regular, and apart from a couple of straightforward morphophonemic rules,
there is only one form for each verbal affix. Nouns and noun inflections are, conversely,
very irregular. In many cases there are slightly different noun stems depending on
which suffix or prefix is to be added, and these are unpredictable by rule. In addition,
for some categories, the form of the suffix taken by a particular noun cannot be
predicted.","[114, 115]"

"
11.6.3 FOCUS SYSTEM VERSUS ALIGNMENT SYSTEMIt is possible to be misled by the agreement patterns of the Agreement Suffix on the verb
and the focus marker into thinking that they form part of a syntactic alignment system.
Consider for example, that in positive clauses the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus
marker generally agree with O of a transitive clause and S of an intransitive clause; and
that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker agree with A/S in negative clauses.
This phenomenon might suggest that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker are
actually forming part of a split-ergative agreement system determined on purely syntactic
principles. There are a number of reasons why this analysis would be unsatisfactory.
Firstly, not all positive clauses have the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker
agreeing with O; sometimes they agree with A. So one would have to find syntactic
reasons why in these cases agreement was with A, not O. One could argue that the split-
ergative system was based on partially syntactic and partially pragmatic principles; and
this kind of system does occur (rarely) in the languages of the world (see e.g. Dixon
1994: 211). But such an analysis would fail to account for the pragmatic function of the
focus marker in the sentences in which it occurs; and it would miss the generalisation that
the agreement of the focus marker (and verbal Agreement Suffix) can be predicted without                                               281

11.6.4 A TYPOLOGICAL NOTELambrecht and Polinsky (1997) propose some typological universals with respect to the
grammatical encoding of sentence focus. They argue that there is a formal, paradigmatic
relationship between predicate focus and sentence focus constructions in languages:
Ò[sentence focus] constructions have the form they do because they are to be minimally
distinct from corresponding [predicate focus] constructions within a given languageÓ
(Lambrecht and Polinsky 1997: 191).","[307, 308]"
"
17.1.1 P OLAR QUESTIONSPolar questions are framed using a focus construction involving the meo focus marker,
with the focus marker agreeing with the questioned element. Since questioned elements
are focussed, by definition, one would expect questions to be expressed using morpho-
syntactically marked focus in a language in which this is available, and this is indeed
what happens in Lavukaleve. Some examples (there are many more in Section 11.7):Questioning an NP:

14.1 SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS
14.1.1 INTRODUCTIONSerial verb constructions consist of two or, rarely, three verbs in juxtaposition,
functioning as a single predicate, with no morphology to mark their relationship with
each other. Each of the verbs receives its own stress, and thus is a separate phonological
word, but the construction as a whole is expressed in one intonational unit. Verbs of a
serial verb construction share their subjects and (if more than one member is transitive)
objects. They also share adjuncts. They share all their morphology except object
marking; all transitive verbs cross-reference their own objects. However, all other
categories that can be marked on verbs (e.g. subject marking, TAM, polarity, valency
changing, and other morphology) are marked only once on the predicate, and have                                             339

Questions and negation
This chapter takes as its starting point the semantic fields of questions and negation and
looks at the kinds of constructions used to express them. The expression of questions
and negation in Lavukaleve involves some use of focus constructions, as well as other
syntactic strategies not involving morphologically-marked focus.","[431, 432, 433]"
"
12.4.1 THE ADMONITIVEThere is a cluster of related meanings associated with the Admonitive suffix -n. The
core meaning, in terms of frequency at least, is the one which the suffix has been named
for: it is used to warn against something, telling the hearer to avoid something bad
happening. It sometimes contains an implied command to not do something. The suffix
is also used for a negative imperative; telling the hearer not to do something, with no
implication of avoiding anything bad that might follow from ignoring the command.
The suffix is also used to indicate that something bad might happen, without any
implied command to avoid it, or not do something. This is a deleterious possibility
usage (in the words of Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994: 211)). The suffix can, more
rarely, be used as an irrealis marker; to mean that something may happen, whether good
or bad, again with no implication that the speaker should do or not do anything to avoid
it. Lastly, the suffix may be used as an exhortative, asking that something, usually good,
should happen. This use is restricted to prayer.",[333]
"These meanings, for the sake of clarity, can be schematised as follows:· DonÕt! (negative imperative)
(No implication of trying to avoid something bad)· Avoid something bad! (admonitive)
(Warning, sometimes an implied negative imperative)· Something bad might happen! (deleterious possibility)
(Pointing it out, with no implication of commanding the hearer to avoid it)· Something might happen! (irrealis)
(No indication of whether the something is good or bad, and no implication that the
hearer should avoid it)· May something happen! (exhortative)
(Asking that something, usually good, may happen. Used in prayer.)This is a large semantic range for one morpheme, but one can clearly see the semantic

                                          12 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODconnections between each of the meanings. The final use, the exhortative, is perhaps
surprising given the first few meanings; but it can be understood it in terms of a slight
alteration of the irrealis meaning of Ôsomething might happenÕ to wanting something to
happen.","[333, 334]"

12.4.2 THE IMPERATIVESThere are two Imperative paradigms, each one with three members, marked for number
(singular, dual and plural). These Imperatives have 2nd person reference. Similar
command-type morphology for 1st inclusive reference is the Hortative -me (discussed
below, Section 12.4.3). Note also the 3rd singular exhortative form, one of the uses of
the Admonitive suffix -n (discussed above, Section 12.4.1), which also falls into a
similar semantic area. The Imperative forms discussed in this section are all positive;
the negative imperative is expressed by the Admonitive suffix -n (see above, Section
12.4.1).",[336]

negative particle tamu: Ôits X is notÕ (see Section 17.2).",[114]
"Focus is a central part of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax. It is heavily grammaticalised into
clause structure, and extremely frequent in discourse. Roughly one third of all clauses
have some kind of grammatical focus construction. Any constituent can be focussed,
including NPs, postpositional phrases and other nominal adjuncts, adverbs, predicates
(either just a verb, or a verb with its object), subordinate clauses, the lexical part of a
complex predicate, or indeed whole sentences. There are two different kinds of
syntactic focus construction, one with the verb in a special form, used to mark focus on
predicates (verb plus object) or whole sentences, and one without this special verb form,
used for focussing on arguments, adjuncts and non-main verbal forms. In both
construction types, focus is marked by special particles, which occur immediately after
the focussed constituent and show agreement in person, gender and number. The scope

                                       1 - I NTRODUCTIONof the focus is indicated by the agreement of the focus marker. There are three separate
paradigms of focus markers, which differ in terms of the sentence type with which they
occur. One is used only in polar questions; one in content questions and environments
expressing particular kinds of emphasis; the third is used elsewhere.","[39, 40]"
"
3.17.5 V OCATIVE PARTICLESThere are three vocative particles, which appear at the end of sentences, and provide
illocutionary force to the utterance. Typically they occur with commands and
exhortations. The three particles are na (vocative, singular), nail (vocative, dual) and
nai (vocative, plural). The particles are always spoken as the final word of an utterance,
after an intonation break (indicated below by the slash and comma respectively in the
following examples), and they always receive very strong stress. Their use is only
possible in very informal circumstances. Note that I have translated them as ÔyouÕ,
which, in this context, seems like the closest functional equivalent in English. They do
not, however, make any reference to person, and are not to be understood as pronouns
of any sort. Some examples:16)    E!     Ngana    lafa       ro         feo        ngonerea              /   na!

3.17.6 HESITATION PARTICLESHesitation particles are used as fillers while a speaker decides what to say next. They
cannot sensibly be said to have scope. Some of the common ones include a, e, mi, i and
mina ÔumÕ. Mina is also a feminine noun meaning ÔthingÕ, but in its use as a hesitation
particle it appears in sentences not as an argument but rather as a filler, while the
speaker thinks of the word they want.","[88, 89]"

                                    11 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS11.6 FURTHER DISCUSSION
11.6.1 NO MARKED FOCUSNot all Lavukaleve sentences have marked focus; in fact only about a third do. Under
LambrechtÕs analysis, all sentences convey information; they all have information
structure, and thus they all have focus. This is certainly true for Lavukaleve, as for all
languages. The above analysis has suggested that are two types of sentences in
Lavukaleve: those with grammatical focus constructions, and those without. By this,
however, it should not be understood that those sentences which do not employ a focus
construction do not have focus. Rather, in those sentences which do not employ focus
constructions, speakers are still conveying information about something; they are still
dividing their speech into presupposition and assertion; but they are not making this
distinction grammatically overt in the way a focus construction does. In other languages
with grammatically marked focus systems, for example Somali (Saeed 1984), the focus
system is likewise not used in every single sentence of the language.","[305, 306]"

the subject of a serial verb construction can be marked only once across the whole
predicate, not once on each verb as here. For the same reason it cannot be any other type
of complex predicate. Syntactically such sequences of verbs are considered to be two
independent clauses in succession. Such constructions only occur with verbs tave and
tuna; in all other cases, clauses in sequence must be overtly marked for their
relationship with each other, either as subordinate-dependent or coordinate-dependent
or coordinated independent clauses.","[444, 445]"

14.1.4 S HARING MORPHOLOGYIt has been shown above that subject cross-referencing is shared among members of a
serial verb construction, while object cross-referencing is not shared, but must be
marked on each transitive verb of a serial verb construction. The Causative suffix
appears on an individual verb, and has scope only over that verb. This can be seen in
example (20) below. All other verbal morphology, including TAM, negation, and
subordinate adverbial clause-marking suffixes, is marked once only in the serial verb
construction, on the final verb, and has scope over the whole predicate. Examples of the
Non-Finite, Imperative and Completive suffixes only occurring on the last member of
the serial verb construction have occurred above (see (1), (3), (4), (6)). Examples of
other sorts of morphology follow:
                                                         343

15)    Vau         keleanun.

There is one exception to this generalisation that morphology appears on the final verb
of a serial verb construction. The Negative suffix -la occurs on the first verb of a serial
verb construction in which lei ÔexistÕ is the last verb. Compare the position of the
Negative suffix in the following sentences with (14) above.","[368, 369, 370]"
"LambrechtÕs three-way analysis works very neatly for Lavukaleve. The two focus
construction types, Sentence-Final and Sentence-Internal focus constructions, differ
syntactically in what constituents they are in construction with and what agreement they
show; and they differ pragmatically in what type of focus they express. Sentence-Internal
focus constructions are used to express argument focus; Sentence-Final focus
constructions are used to express either predicate3 focus or sentence focus. Focus markers
are used in Lavukaleve precisely to show, by means of their agreement, the scope over
which focus is asserted.",[280]

12.2.1 THE FUTURE TENSEThe Future Tense is marked by verbal suffix -re. The Future Tense category marks an
event or state as being located in a time which is after now. In Chung and TimberlakeÕs
(1985) terms, it is an absolute tense marker, marking time with respect to the speech
event. Some examples:1)     Efuluge                         fi        aka lekalem                      na       aka

The most common use of the Future Tense marker, and the one exemplified above, is
for prediction of events. It can also be used to indicate that the speaker thinks an event
should occur:

reference. It can co-occur with the Causative suffix (which it follows), and the
Agreement Suffix (which it precedes). Tense-marked verbs cannot receive Aspect or
Mood suffixation, but note that the Future Tense suffix can be used with the Habitual
Auxiliary (see Section 14.3). As tense marking does not occur on negated verbs, to
express a negative future clause, the Habitual Auxiliary with the Future Tense suffix
must be used in construction with a negated verb:7)     ""O kosora mefo'sal        rovoru      vokurula          merev                       fome""

coordinate-dependent verbs which form a sequence with the following clause. It can be
easily distinguished from the Future Tense marker on morphological and semantic
grounds. A verb marked by the Non-Finite suffix cannot receive subject cross-
referencing, can receive certain Aspect marking, and has no constraints on time
reference. Conversely, a Future Tense marked verb can easily occur with subject cross-
referencing (as shown in the above examples), cannot receive Aspect marking (as
mentioned above) and can only have future time reference. The Non-Finite suffix is
discussed in Section 15.4.4.","[323, 324]"

Sentence focus is also used in situations where something happens counter to
expectations. In the next sentence the speaker has just been startled by an arrow landing
next to her with no warning, and then is further surprised to see the addressee, who had
sneaked up behind her. She asks the question, expressing surprise that the man in front of
her might own the arrow, although it is clear that she had no expectation of who the
owner is (so this isnÕt contrastive focus):25)    ""Tumai, i n u      ta     mina         onuvem            hin?""

obey their chiefs, and contrasting that with the perceived disobedience in villages now.
He uses sentence focus in this sentence for a strong statement, that those people then
obeyed the chiefsÕ word, which makes an explicit contrast with the people of today. The
speaker is talking to an audience of younger people, and he is perhaps slightly defensively
making a strong point, using the marked sentence focus construction, to achieve this.",[286]
"The fourth part of the thesis deals with interclausal syntax: clause chaining constructions
(Chapter 15) and subordinate clauses (Chapter 16). There are three types of subordinate
clauses; one of them, subordinate adverbial clauses, involves a split-ergative marking
system. Most other areas of the language have nominative/accusative alignment. The final
part of the thesis, discourse organisation, aims to bring together some of the broader areas
of importance to Lavukaleve discourse. The expression of questions and negation is
described in Chapter 17. In Chapter 18 is a discussion of typical Lavukaleve ways of
structuring discourse in narratives for textual cohesion, and an examination of how
reference tracking devices operate across a larger section of narrative than a single
sentence.",[10]
"LambrechtÕs idea of focus is a refinement of the traditional view of focus as new
information. Under his analysis, focus does not function to mark a constituent as new: for
one thing, it is not constituents alone that convey new information, but rather, the
conveying of information (old or new) comes about via the establishment of relations
between elements of the proposition (1994: 46-50). Indeed, focus functions Ònot to mark
a constituent as new but to signal a focus relation between an element of a proposition and
the proposition as a wholeÓ (p. 210). (Note that Òa focus relation is the pragmatic relation
between a denotatum and a propositionÓ (p. 210)). And further,
       I do not define the focus of a sentence as Ôthe new informationÕ ... Rather I claim that
       the focus is to be understood as a formal scope indicator, i.e. as a grammatical signal
       indicating the scope of the assertion expressed by a sentence or proposition. The focus
       indicates which portions of the sentence are asserted and which portions are
       pragmatically presupposed. (1987: 374)Further, the focus of a sentence
       is seen as the element of information whereby the presupposition and the assertion
       DIFFER from each other. The focus is that portion of a proposition which cannot be
       taken for granted at the time of speech. It is the UNPREDICTABLE or pragmatically NON-

         assertionÓ. (p. 207, his emphasis)2Focus occurs over a domain: Ò[t]he syntactic domain in a sentence which expresses the
focus component of the pragmatically structured propositionÓ (p. 214). This focus
domain is phrasal, not lexical, because it is the relationship between propositions, not the
mere appearance of lexical items, which serves to convey focus. Thus, focus domains are
always either predicates, arguments, or whole sentences.","[278, 279]"
"
11.2 MORPHOLOGY AND SYNTAX OF THE FOCUS MARKERSThe focus markers are independent words which form their own word class. The three
focus markers each form a paradigm of suppletive forms marked for person, gender and
number. The three different focus markers are meo, heo and feo (cited throughout in
their 3rd person singular feminine form). Each one is used for a different sentence type.
Meo is used in polar questions. Heo is used in certain syntactic environments such as
information questions, or where there is a demonstrative pronoun foia in the clause, or as
the second focus marker in a focus-echo construction. Heo can also be used to express
strong emphasis; this use of heo rather than feo or meo is not obligatory (unlike the
others), but a pragmatic choice made by a speaker for a certain effect. The third focus
marker, feo, is the unmarked one; it has the widest distribution and the least constraints
on its use. It is used in all situations where grammatical focus is to be expressed, apart
from those using heo or meo. In this sense, feo can be viewed as the default focus
marker.",[274]

17.1.4 CONTENT QUESTIONS USING INTERROGATIVE LEXICAL ITEMSContent questions are often phrased in focus constructions using specific interrogative
lexical items. These interrogative words belong to various word classes, and thus have
different syntactic properties. The full list is as follows:WORD              GLOSS                     WORD CLASS
