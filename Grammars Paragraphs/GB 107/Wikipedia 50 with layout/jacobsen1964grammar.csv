For        example,       adopting           the         alternative             of     1.7.1(setting         up a ""long             stress”)          would           preclude            the     adoption
of that        of 1.7.3            (analyzing            long vowels               as geminates),                  and

likely        the        adoption       of    that       of        1.7.9        (glottalized              resonantsas unitary               phonemes),          and vice              versa.
        1.7.1.            Long    and       short     stress.               There       exists           a relation-ship     between           stress       and    length              which     might       be     recognized              byan    alternative            analysis          to    the           one    that     has     been          adopted        inthis     grammar.            The     present         analysis               assumes        a phoneme
                                                                                                   ofstrong        stress /’/,            a phoneme            of weak            stress,           which       is generally
unmarked        but        which     we mark         /”’/          for    the     purpose           of    this     expo-sition,        and        2a phoneme         ef length /+/.                      The    length           phoneme
eccurs        only        after     strongly          stressed              vowels,        not        after       weaklystressed         ones.           Thus       length       presupposes               strong           streas        whilethe    reverse            is not     true.          Ye    therefore               have     the        three       follow-ing     syllable           nuclei:

This
phoneme        would        be    menifested             by        beth     strong        stressof    the     vowel        with    which       it    occurred.                   Then    the        syliabie        nucleiwould       beccme:
                    aA                  ’

                                                                   e

         An    advantage             of    this           analysis          would       be        the       simplificationof    syllabie           types       (see       2.2).           With        every       vowel           there          would
occur     one       and       only     one      stress          phoneme.             With          the       analysisthat     has       been       adopted,          however,             either        one       or        two       of     these“suprasegmentals""                    occurs          with       any       one     vowel.              This        means          thatthe    length        phoneme          has       a    distribution                 which          is     not       paralleledby    that     of     any      cther       phoneme,         This       analysis          would          also       make        somewhat             more        straight-forward        the       morphophonemic                    shortening             that       is       a necessaryconcomitant              of weakening                of     stress          (3.18,          3.19).              As     thingsstand,        we    are       forced       to       posit       a    charge        of       two       entities,stress        and     length,         at     the      same          time.         The       alternative                  analysiswould     bring          it    about       that       only          one     entity          would          be     lost       atany    one     time.           There       would          not       be    a reduction                 in     the       totalnumber        of    rules,       however,             for       there        would          be     twe       parallelrules     operating             in    identical              environments,                   one        for       the       weak-ening     of       the    long       stress          and     the         other     for       the        weakening                ofthe    short        stress.","[73, 74, 75, 76]"
