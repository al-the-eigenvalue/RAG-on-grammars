7.3.1. Negative Clitics
       There exist two negative clitics: /=ŋgó/, which is used in both NoG and SoG and
/=cê/, which is used by Gumuz speakers living in and around Sirba Abay wereda
(county) as well as parts of Wenbera and Agelo Met’i weredas. These clitics are
restricted to attaching to main clause verbs (7.185-7.187); when negating a subordinate
clause, one must use (with some exceptions) a negative auxiliary (see Chapter XI,                                            241
examples 11.64, 11.65). Also, as stated previously in section 7.2.1.2, the negative clitic
does not normally co-occur with the affirmative prefix.","[270, 271]"

       NoG and SoG verbs lack the affirmative marker when the verb is negated. In
both NoG and parts of SoG (Kamashi) the negative clitic /=(a)ŋg̩ ó/ attaches to the end of
the conjugated verb. In (7.76) affirmative and negative forms of the same verb are used.","[237, 238]"

clause is semantically negative, both the conditional clause and the consequent clause use
the verbal construction with /b-/ (13.17). If the consequent clause is semantically
positive, the conditional clause will be introduced with /éé-/ (13.13). However, as shown
in (13.16) a negative hypothetical event in which the verb of the conditional clause is
affirmative and the verb of the consequent clause is negative is also possible with the
hypothetical n- construction.","[466, 467]"

      Affirmative commands do not use any form of the ma- construction. Furthermore,
the affirmative commands use two distinct constructions. The first and second persons
follow what I call an ‘imperative’ form and third person follows a ‘jussive’ form. The
imperative is formed with the verb root followed by a bound subject pronominal plus
other possible stem morphology (e.g. directional, IN/Classifier). The jussive is formed
with the prefix /n-/ or /l-/ (for some speakers of NoG) followed by a bound third person
subject pronominal plus the verb stem (see also Example 8.124 of Chapter VII). For
comparison with negative commands, Tables 11.3 and 11.4 provide imperative and
jussive forms of ‘go’ in NoG and SoG respectively.",[411]

7.2.1. Mood
           The first morpheme position on the verb (only the nonfuture verb in SoG) is
occupied by the ‘affirmative’ morphemeː /d-/ (NoG) and /b-/ (SoG). 8 Uzar (1989: 383)
first labeled this ‘affirmative’ as it does not occur with interrogatives or negatives. I have
maintained this label but ‘affirmative’ does not fully account for all instances of when
this morpheme is used. Notably, most non-initial affirmative verbs in subordinate clauses
and clause chains lack the affirmative morpheme.","[234, 235]"

11.2.2.           Complements of Negative Auxiliaries
          To negate a subordinate clause verb in Gumuz (save a few exceptions), one must
use a negative auxiliary in place of the negative enclitics =ŋgó (NoG, SoG-Kamashi) or
=cê (SoG-Sirba Abay) that are used for main clause verbs (see Chapter VII for further
discussion of negative enclitics). There exist two negative auxiliaries ko and batsʼ(-áʃ),
both of which are used in SoG (11.49, 11.60, 11.61), while only batsʼ is used in NoG
(11.43, 11.59). For most subordinate clauses, the complement of these negative
auxiliaries is a non-finite form of the ma- construction. 11

  Example (11.60) is translated directly from Amharic. As the construction in Amharic uses ‘say’ in a
clause chain, I believe the consultant translated the sentence literally and the sentence can be said without a
‘say’ construction in Gumuz. However, ‘say’ in Gumuz (as in Amharic) often indicates intent.","[403, 404]"

7.2.1.1 The Affirmative Marker and Question Constructions
        Lack of the affirmative morpheme with a final rise in intonation generally
indicates a Yes/No question (7.66). In SoG, one must also add the Yes/No question
marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ to the end of the clause (7.67) (see also section 7.3.2).",[236]

complement are expressed with the ma- construction (although the ma- on the negative
auxiliary forms part of the purposive prefix; see Chapter XIII). Unlike other negative
subordinate clauses, the negative auxiliary of the purpose clause remains uninflected for
person and number and its complement carries all inflection (11.62). The form of the
negative auxiliary in this construction, similar to the ‘go’ auxiliary in section 11.2.1.2,
appears to be a frozen 3SG form of the verb in the ma- construction: m-batsʼ-á (NMLZ-

Below are the variations from one Kamashi speaker in polite versus impolite negative
forms of CV H tone verb roots in SoG. In the affirmative, the 2SG imperative
counterparts are : tsá ‘goǃ’, sá ‘eatǃ’, and fá ‘drinkǃ’. 1414
  One explanation for the variation in tone for the Strong vs. Polite conjugation of CV verb roots is that
these roots may be toneless with a H tone added in the 2SG imperative form. That is, the roots tsa ‘go’ and
sa ‘eat’ may not be assigned tone but H tone is added for the 2SG imperative form. It is also possible that                                                   383

        A negative circumstantial adverbial clause is a dependent clause expressing an
event that did not or will not happen before the event of the matrix clause. These are
often translated into English as ‘without X-ing, ...’ In NoG, the construction for negative
adverbials is as follows: /kaʒiigá=/ + /mâ-/ (an abbreviated form of the purpose prefix) +
the verb root + any applicable morphemes ordered according to the future tense (13.24).
The /kaʒiigá=/ clitic appears to be comprised of the instrumental preposition /ka=/
followed by the verb root ʒiig ‘be poor, be without’. The final /á/ in this clitic complex is                                              440
likely a remnant from the dative proclitic /ká=/ which forms the purposive prefix /káma-/
or /kám -/̀ (see Chapter 11). The /kaʒiigá=/ clitic is also found with NPs meaning
‘without’ or ‘except’ (13.25).","[469, 470]"

the negative clitic, so a negative auxiliary must be used (see section 11.2.2 below). 4 As a4
 There exist a few exceptions in which the negative clitic can be used in a complement clause, namely the
more nominal complements like that found in (11.25).",[394]

two bare objects. Indirect objects are marked with the prepositional proclitic ka=.
However, it could be the case that ‘belly’ and ‘house’ form a nominal compound which
functions as the O argument and that ‘belly’ is not incorporated into the verb. Indeed
there exists a nominal compound: líí-mátsʼá (belly-house) ‘floor’. However, one can see
that ‘belly’ forms a phonological unit with ‘house’ in this NN compound as the vowel
and the consonant metathesize. In contrast, when forming a phonological unit with the
verb, ‘belly’ maintains its vowel-consonant structure: -ííl.13 In Southern Gumuz, however,
such a metathesis does not occur as the initial vowel-consonant structure is often found in
the noun stem as well as in the IN. Thus, other (syntactic) evidence would be necessary
for this dialect to demonstrate that the noun root contiguous with the verb root and the
following O argument do not actually form a NN compound. Indeed, both incorporation
and compounding are possible in Gumuz for clauses with (nearly) identical translations.
But there are clear differences between the structures as shown both by phonology and
negative placement. In (8.29a), the noun ílúkʼwá ‘head’ is incorporated into the verb stem.
However, in (8.29b) ílúkʼwá ‘head’ forms a compound with hosa ‘cow’14 and this
compound functions as the O argument. Both clauses can propositionally mean ‘Skin the
cow’s head’. In Gumuz, the negative =ŋg̩ ó is an enclitic that attaches to both nouns and
verbs. Examples (8.30 a-b) provide the negative forms of the commands in (8.29 a-b),
demonstrating that there is a word boundary between ‘head’ and ‘cow’ in example
(8.29a). On the other hand, the word boundary in (8.29b) is after the verb root kóɗ ‘skin’
as demonstrated with its negative form in (8.30b). Thus, (8.29a) and (8.30a) must have
INs in the verb stem as the negative enclitic should not separate the two noun roots of a
NN compound.","[284, 285]"

11.4. Negative Commands
         What I label a ‘negative command’ in Gumuz includes both the negative of
imperative forms as well as the negative of jussive forms. Negative imperative and
jussive forms are structurally the same: /ka-/ INSTR + ma- construction + bound subject
pronominal + negative enclitic in NoG and ma- construction + bound subject pronominal
+ negative enclitic in SoG. The 2SG form is often unmarked in SoG (11.80). 13 I gloss the
resulting /kama-/ (NoG) and corresponding /ma-/ (SoG) prefixes as NEG.IMP (negative
imperative).

enclitic is =cê (11.82). Otherwise, the structure of the negative command is the same as
in and around Kamashi wereda.","[409, 410]"

        Other morphemes can occupy the first position on the verb; all but one (the
jussive) of these others introduce subordinate clauses: /nágó-/ ‘when, because’, /ká-/ ‘if’
(conditional), the relativizers /l-/ and /et-/, and the jussive /n-/. In this grammar, I refer to
all these first-position prefixes as markers of “mood”. Example (7.65) illustrates the
affirmative in a simple affirmative clause.","[235, 236]"

arguments are questioned in SoG, the affirmative marker does not need to occur (7.74,

7.3.   Clitics
       There are at least four enclitics found on fully inflected verb forms in Gumuz, two
of which are only found in SoG: the Yes/No question clitic and the clitic indicating
perfect aspect. Both dialects have the negative clitic /=ŋgó/ but the Sirba Abay
subdialect (SoG) has a distinct form /=cê/. A hearsay clitic is present in both dialects as
well. Clitics in Gumuz are phonologically bound in that tonal downstep of H tones does
not occur between the verb (or noun) and the enclitic, and there exists no phonological
pause between morphemes. However, the final /a/ on the word to which it attaches is
pronounced [a] instead of [ə] as though the vowel were in word-final position (see
Chapter II). All known clitics, with the exception of the aspectual clitic in SoG, occur on
nouns as well as verbs in Gumuz. The Yes/No question particle is a clause final clitic
while the remaining enclitics are word-final.","[269, 270]"

conditional clause exhibits the following structure: the /n-/ prefix + a bound subject
pronominal + /gá-/ + the ma- construction + the /-n/ locative suffix (13.18). This latter
construction is also used to express the notion ‘before/without X-ing’ (13.19) and is often
used with 3PL impersonal subject marking (Chapter VII). 44
  The /-n/ locative suffix appears to mark a subordinate adverbial clause in SoG. However, temporal and
many conditional clauses are not marked with this suffix. It appears to be related to the /-ná/ found on non-
initial verbs of clause chains in SoG.

        Lastly, one can also express a negative conditional clause in SoG with the same
negative hypothetical construction as above (n- plus gá-) but with the /b-/ prefix instead
of the /n-/ prefix (13.20).","[467, 468]"

       This chapter describes various types of functional adverbial clauses found in
Gumuz. Some adverbial clauses utilize the ma- construction which was introduced in
Chapter XI, but others do not. Temporal and conditional (and some causal) adverbial
clauses are simply introduced with an erstwhile preposition followed by a finite verbal
form. Some temporal and conditional clauses involve the morpheme /gó-/ found in
relator noun constructions (Chapter III) as well as ‘where’/‘place’ relative clauses
(Chapter XII). Adverbial clauses involving hypothetical and/or counterfactual events are
formed with a finite form of the ma- construction combined with the affirmative prefix
and other possible erstwhile prepositions. Yet other adverbial clauses can be introduced
with a distinct phonological words/phrases (or clitics) meaning ‘at the time of’ and
‘because’, and ‘without’. Lastly, purpose adverbial clauses are introduced with the prefix
     ̀ whether nonfinite or finite. This last prefix is a combination of the
/kám -/,
dative/benefactive /ká=/ preposition plus the ma- nominalizing prefix (of the ma-
construction). Purposive clauses in NoG can also be formed with the /ká=/ prefix
followed by /gó-/ plus the ma- construction.
       The following sections are organized by function and not by structure. Section
13.1 describes temporal adverbial clauses, section 13.2 describes conditional adverbial
clauses, section 13.3 describes concessive adverbial clauses, section 13.4 describes
negative circumstantial adverbial clauses, section 13.5 covers causal adverbial clauses,
and section 13.6 describes purpose clauses.","[460, 461]"

affirmative prefix is not used and the tonal pattern associated with the bound subject
pronominal of the verb reflects the tonal pattern of main clause Middle Voice
Constructions (12.103).

12.3.2.3       Relativizing on O Arguments
       When relativizing on O arguments in SoG, the O head is nearly always lexically
overt, whether as part of a predicate nominal, or frequently appearing before the RC
(12.104). The verb of the RC can be expressed with or without the affirmative prefix /b-/
in the nonfuture tense in which case the relative pronoun/relativizer /etá-/ is
phonologically reduced to /et-/ when the affirmative prefix is not expressed (12.105)
(similar to relativizing on A arguments). Also, clauses relativized on an O argument can
be part of the 3PL Impersonal Construction; all examples of such a type demonstrate an
intransitive tonal melody on the bound subject pronominal on the RC verb (12.105,
12.106).","[454, 455]"

across the border in southeastern Sudan. This study compares the phonology and
selected aspects of the grammar of two major dialects within the Gumuz cluster:
Northern Gumuz (NoG) and Southern Gumuz (SoG), both of which are spoken in the
Benishangul-Gumuz Region of western Ethiopia. Analysis is based on twenty months of
fieldwork in Ethiopia conducted from September of 2007 through April of 2009.
Language data was gathered from thirty-three native speakers of Gumuz: fourteen from
NoG and nineteen from SoG. The Gumuz language consultants provided a total of sixty-
eight texts of varying lengths and multiple genres, thirty-four texts from NoG and thirty-
four texts from SoG. In addition, a list of approximately two thousand words was
collected from each dialect as well as countless hours of elicited language data. To aid in
further comparison, I worked with two additional Gumuz language consultants from
Yaso wereda 1 eliciting several hours of language data and one text. To date, this is the
first description of Gumuz which analyzes and compares the grammar and phonology of
the two main dialects - that of the north and that of the south. In addition, this description
includes the first tonal analysis of any Gumuz dialect.
         This first chapter gives an overview of the Gumuz language, where it is spoken, a
description of the dialect cluster, Gumuz culture, history, and migrations. It also includes
a review of previous descriptions of the Gumuz language and the various attempts to
classify it. Chapter II provides a description of the phonological inventories of NoG and
SoG, phonological rules, and a discussion of tonal contrasts as well as tonal downstep
and related rules. Chapter III covers the basic shape and phonology of simple noun words

 A wereda is a political division roughly equivalent to a county in the United States. Ethiopian regions are
divided into zones, which are further divided into weredas. A wereda, in turn, is divided into smaller units
called k’ebeles.","[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

  The non-initial or dependent (DEP) verbs of clause chains in SoG are marked with /-(á)ná/ in addition to
their lack of the affirmative prefix. If the affirmative is added to a non-initial (dependent, non-main) verb,
the resulting interpretation is that there is a lag in time between events.",[239]

11.2. Complements of Auxiliaries
         There are at least four known auxiliaries in Gumuz: ‘go’, ‘be’ and two negative
auxiliaries batsʼ and ko. 10 All four of these auxiliaries precede their verbal complements.
The following subsections describe the complements of the ‘go’ auxiliary and the two
negative auxiliaries. The ‘be’ auxiliary can optionally form part of the progressive
construction (section 11.4).","[401, 402]"

13.2. Conditional Adverbial Clauses         In NoG, conditional clauses are introduced with the prefix /k-/ on the verb in
place of the affirmative /d-/ prefix, and they are always expressed in the nonfuture tense.
The conditional adverbial clause takes the same form regardless of whether the matrix
clause expresses a ‘possible’ event, a hypothetical event (13.9), and/or ‘counterfactual’
event (13.10, 13.11); all these semantic readings are possible whether the matrix verb is
expressed in the future (13.10) or nonfuture tenses (13.9).2 When the matrix verb is
2
 If the S argument of an intransitive conditional clause precedes the verb or is not overt, an /-á/ suffix is
added to the verb. This is the same suffix that is added to the verb of the relative clause in NoG under the
same conditions (see section 12.2.1.2 of Chapter XII). This /-á/ suffix might also indicate that the subject of

tisákʼwá following a ‘future tense’ form of the main verb (13.11, 13.12). If the matrix
clause is an affirmative counterfactual, the negative form of the ‘future tense’ verb is
used (13.12). If the matrix verb is introducing a counterfactual event, the hypothetical
prefix /dega-/ is used on the ‘future tense’ main verb (13.11). 3                  NoG (Gumuz saying)

the subordinate clause is different than that of the matrix, but further investigation is needed (see example
12.76 of Chapter XII).

 It is possible that /dega-/ can be broken down further as there exists a related hypothetical prefix /daga-/.
See example (12.88) of section 12.2.1 in Chapter XII.

       In SoG, conditional adverbial clauses expressing a possible event in the future are
introduced with the prefix /éé-/ plus an inflected form of the ma- construction (Chapter
XI), following the pattern of a future tense verb. The matrix verb likewise is expressed in
the future tense form (13.13). If the hypothetical event is expressed in the past, the verbs
of both the conditional clause and the consequent clause are formed with the prefix /n-/
followed by a bound subject pronominal and the ma- construction (13.14). The two
clauses (conditional and consequent) in this latter construction are structurally identical
and appear to be distinguished via order — the conditional clause is expressed before the
consequent clause. These clauses also appear to be equally dependent, neither capable of
being uttered without the other.","[464, 465, 466]"

  To express that someone or something is the cause in NoG, one can use either tʃagwa ‘foot’ or maanɟa
‘fire’ as the first noun in the Associative Construction (Chapter VI) with the second noun functioning as the
cause. With tʃagwa, one must also use the locative preposition ná= and the cause is semantically neutral
(not negative). With maanɟa, the dative preposition ká= is used and the cause is negative (see also
example 13.28 for the metaphor ‘fire’ being used to indicate a ‘problem’). Both of these constructions
roughly translate as ‘because of X’.

       Purpose clauses in Gumuz are formed with the dative ká followed by either a
nonfinite or finite form of the ma- construction. In many cases, these two morphemes
                                      ̀ but the /a/ vowel of the nominalizer /ma-/ deletes
appear to be fused as the prefix /kám -/,
and a floating L tone remains. This floating L tone causes downstep of a following H

     ̀ prefix and its allomorph(s) are identical in structure to the future tense prefix of
/kám -/
SoG (and the immediate future prefix of NoG). In NoG, a purpose clause can also be
formed with ká plus gó (<góá ‘place’) followed by the ma- construction.","[471, 472]"

12.3.2 SoG Relative Clauses
          There are two main strategies for relativizing on core arguments in SoGː 1) the
relative pronoun strategy and 2) the relativizer strategy. In SoG there exist two relative                                               421
pronouns used to relativize on core arguments of a finite RC (where NoG has just one of
these)ː /etá-/ PRO.SG and /dá-/ PRO.PL. The relative pronoun /etá-/ can be used to
relativize on non-core participants, namely objects of prepositions. Lastly, the relative
pronoun /gó-/ ‘where’ relativizes on locations. All relative pronouns can either occur
with the affirmative prefix /b-/ of nonfuture verbs or without the prefix. When /etá-/
PRO.SG introduces a clause which lacks the affirmative prefix, the pronoun isphonologically reduced in that the final /á/ is lost. Along with phonological reduction,
there is some degree of semantic bleaching in that the ‘relative pronoun’ no longer
(necessarily) refers to animate singular referents. Thus, /et-/ begins to resemble a
relativizer in such constructions.","[450, 451]"
"
12.3.2.1       Relativizing on A Arguments
        When relativizing on A arguments, one can use either the /etá-/ (/etsá-/ in
Kamashi wereda) PRO.SG or the /dá-/ PRO.PL relative pronouns. In general, one cannot
use the relative pronouns with the /b-/ affirmative prefix when relativizing on an A
argument but there exist a few exceptions (12.90, 12.91). Also, when using the plural
relative pronoun for relativizing on an A argument, the bound subject pronominal
remains 3SG in form even when the referent is 3PL (12.91, 12.93).   (12.90)     ŋga etsá-b-a-dá-gá
               food PRO.SG-AFF-3SG.TR-do-NFUT
               ‘The one who prepared the food’   (12.91)     dá-b-é-e-míc                        kʼóá

               PL-Bacic COM=wife-3SG.POSS
               ‘The ones who chased (remote past) the dog are Bacic and his wife.’       In the present corpus, these pronouns more frequently introduce a RC which lacks
the affirmative prefix when relativizing on the A argument. Without the affirmative
prefix, the PRO.SG relative pronoun also lacks the final /á/ which carries H tone: /et-/ (/ets-

/ in Kamashi wereda) (12.92). The plural pronoun, on the other hand, retains the /á/ vowel
(12.93).     (12.92)      et-a-míc-agá                   kʼóá á-báácíc

                  COM=woman-3SG.POSS
                  ‘The ones who chased the dog are Bacic and his wife.’         In SoG relativization on an A argument can either have a head (12.94) or beheadless (12.90-12.93). Most examples of RCs with heads are postnominal and lack the
affirmative prefix on the verb.     (12.94)      ɓaga et-a-tʃʼá-ká              lamáána eé-kea
                  person PRO.SG-3SG.TR-have-NFUT wealth AUG-beer                  b-a-da-ká
                  AFF-3SG.TR-prepare-NFUT                  ‘The person who has money prepares the feast.’
         When forming a future tense RC, the singular relative pronoun retains its final /á/
as does the plural pronoun. Unlike main clause verbs, the future tense RC verbs lack the
initial /ká/ of the /kám -/̀ future prefix. The future RC form involves a verb nominalized
with /ma-/ followed by a bound subject pronominal. Again, when relativizing on an A
argument, the bound subject pronominal is 3SG when the referent is 3PL. 2121
  The 3SG future tense form of the verb ‘chase’ in (12.95, 12.96) is identical to the verb nominalized with
/ma-/, and is thus identical in form to an Agent Nominalization or nominalized RC.","[451, 452]"

               ‘The ones they are chasing are dogs.’       When the RC consists of an auxiliary plus its nominalized complement, a clear
resumptive pronoun strategy is employed for relativizing on an O argument. Such is true
for both relativization strategies. With the bare relativizer strategy, the RC is prenominal
and the tonal pattern on the negative auxiliary is transitive. While the tonal pattern in
(12.77) suggests that it might be internally headed, the RC appears to have an external
head with a resumptive pronoun (RP) suffix (/-má/) on the nominalized verb of the RC
which is coreferential with the external head.","[445, 446]"

         The participant nominalizations in (12.10) and (12.11, 12.12) are very similar in
form to the participant nominalizations referring to animate plural A/S arguments. A
participant nominalization similar to (12.10) exists in NoG as well (12.13a). The main
difference in this particular example is that the /-má/ suffix is added to mark an
erstwhile O argument and dá is repeated as the predicate nominal. When negated with
the negative clitic =ŋg̩ ó, the inherent possession suffix referencing the O argument, /-má/,
is not used (12.13b). 2                  NoG

the referent is a plural human A argument, whereas in (12.13), the referent is an
inanimate patient argument of the verb sá ‘eat’. Thus, it appears as though sentential
context is required to distinguish the ambiguity between dáá PRO.INAN (‘thing’) and
dáá PRO.PL (animate). 3 In (12.13 a), dá ‘thing’, of the predicate nominal makes it clear
2
  One can determine that the noun dá ‘thing’ is part of the NN collocation in (12.13b) in that the H tone on
dá does not undergo downstep as it does when it is a distinct noun functioning as the head of a NP. Also,
the register for tone is reset for the second NP in an NP NP juxtaposition. Thus, tone height indicates
whether the noun is incorporated into a verb or forms a distinct word/phrase (from the previous word).
3
  The Gumuz dialect spoken in Gesas (south of the Mandura area), however, distinguishes animacy via
vowel length: dáá- for animate and dá- for inanimate (Travis Williamson, personal communication). Also, a
nominalized transitive verb can, in some cases, refer to the O argument modified by the verb (see examples
6.53-6.54 of Chapter VI) and not the event itself. For example, the nominalized VP ‘to tear a sack’ can also
mean ‘a torn sack’. Thus some Gumuz speakers use ma-sa-dá (NMLZ-eat-thing) for ‘thing to eat’ (which
also means ‘to eat something’) instead of the forms given in (12.10) and (12.13).","[419, 420]"

       When relativizing on an S argument in SoG, the RC often has a head, in which
case the RC is postnominal (12.97, 12.98). However, prenominal RCs are also possible
(12.99) as well as headless RCs (12.100). The RC retains the /b-/ affirmative prefix and
the tonal pattern of the verb in the RC is identical to that of intransitive main clause verbs
(when expressed in Active Voice).","[452, 453]"

in Gumuz, relational versus absolute nouns, as well as all known inflectional and
derivational morphology on nouns. Chapter IV describes both bound and free
pronominals. These include personal pronouns, subject and object pronominals on the
verb, possessive suffixes on nouns, as well as interrogative and relative pronouns.
Chapter V discusses the possible constituents of both noun phrases and prepositional
phrases, the latter of which demonstrates some syntactic properties of a noun phrase.
Chapter VI describes nonfinite nominal modification constructions, which demonstrate
properties of both compounds and phrases. Chapter VII covers the structure of the verb
word, discussing verbal morphology and the relative positions of morphemes on the verb.
The grammars of the two Gumuz dialects , NoG and SoG, are most divergent with regard
to verbal morphology. Thus, the similarities and differences between the two are
discussed in great detail in Chapter VII. Chapter VIII introduces the synchronic process
of noun incorporation in Gumuz, as a prelude to the more grammaticalized (and
lexicalized) historically incorporated nouns/class morphemes to be discussed later in
Chapter IX. Chapter IX describes both the verbal classifiers and class morphemes which
historically arose from body part terms in Gumuz. The resultant noun categorizations
that arose from these grammaticalized body part terms (some of which are verbally
incorporated and others of which form part of NN compounds) are described in detail.
Chapter X describes simple clauses found in Gumuz, including copular clauses,
expressions of possession, comparative and superlative constructions, intransitive and
transitive clauses, and possible ditransitives. Case marking alignment is also briefly
discussed. Chapter XI describes the various constructions in Gumuz in which verbs
nominalized with /ma-/ are utilized. These constructions include complements,
subordinate clauses, progressive aspect, and the negative jussive/imperative forms.
Chapter XII covers the various clausal constructions ranging from participant
nominalizations to fully finite relative clause constructions. Lastly, Chapter XIII
discusses various adverbial clauses including temporal, conditional, concessive,
hypothetical/counterfactual, causal, and purpose clause constructions.","[30, 31]"

denoting reason or cause are formed with a dative prepositional phrase, the incorporated
preposition appears to index these causal obliques. The dative preposition is used as part
of a complex word used to express ‘why?’ and ‘because’ ká-ts(á) / kâ-nts(á) (for what?).
Consider the questions (a) and respective responses (b) in (7.116) and (7.117). The
dative /ká-/ of the question word corresponds to the dative suffix on the verb in both
(7.116a) and (7.117a). Likewise, the dative form in the answer, whether as part of the
purposive (7.116b) or part of the question word, correlates to the dative affix on the verb
of the question. Alternatively, the dative form is part of the repeated “question word” in
the answer with the meaning ‘because’ (7.117b).","[250, 251]"

7.2.1.4 Jussive
         In Gumuz, the jussive mood relates to commands for third person subjects and is
marked by the prefix /n-/. This jussive prefix occupies the same position as the
‘affirmative’ prefix and the two prefixes are mutually exclusive. A verb conjugated in
the jussive mood has person marking before the verb root, similar to nonfuture
conjugations (see also Chapter XI) (7.82). 10            SoG

            ‘Wash the bed (linens) (and) the child shall sleep on it.’7.2.2. Person / Number
         Both person and number are marked on the verb in Gumuz. This is mainly for S
and A but can also include O in NoG. All bound pronominals vary in tone according to
the valence of the verb stem (see Chapter IV) and indicate person as well as number. The
plurals are interpreted as ‘paucal’ (two to four people) in NoG. In order to indicate a
larger number of participants in NoG, one must use the ‘greater plural’ suffix in addition
to the plural (or singular) form of the bound pronominal. As Chapter IV discusses all the
various forms of the bound pronominals, the following sections focus on simultaneous A
and O marking in NoG (Section 7.2.2.1), the ‘greater plural’ in NoG (Section 7.2.2.2);
and the use of the third person plural form for passive meaning (Section 7.2.2.3).","[239, 240]"

        Despite all the variations, only one personal pronoun is suspected of being
borrowed: áŋk(ʼ)o 1SG (4.2). A similar bound pronominal is found in Bertha, a
neighboring N-S language: -ɲkʼo 1SG.POSS (Benishangul-Gumuz Language
Development Project 2007:212). This pronoun is used only once in SoG as a free form
(meaning 1SG) and twice as a bound form (by a different speaker meaning 1SG.POSS) in
the present corpus.    (4.2)    b-a-kóó-gá                      m-u-é-a                        éé=áŋko

             ‘He keeps from coming like me (unlike me, he stays home).’        Certain pronoun forms from Table 4.1 appear to be more phrasal, combining
bound pronominal-like forms with demonstrative adjectives. At least one of these forms
is phonologically one word (4.3). That is, there exists no tonal downstep of H tones at
the supposed morpheme boundary: dá-ná 3PL (NoG). 3 However, the speaker translated
the pronoun as a phrase: ‘these people’. When asked to produce the same clause using
‘they’, the speaker used the pronoun áχámááma.

             ‘They (these people) will do it by themselves.’        Other personal pronouns that are phrase-like are phonologically two words
according to tonal patterns. That is, H tones are downstepped at word boundaries. All but
one of these involve the bound pronominal dáá- PRO.PL which is an allomorph of the
morpheme in (4.3) (see also Chapter XII) and only occurs in NoG as part of a personal
pronoun. As dáá- PRO.PL does not occur as an independent noun in Gumuz, I will
consider these phrase-like pronouns to be equivalent to single words. Example (4.4) has
a phrasal pronoun form similar to the form in (4.3) above.","[135, 136]"

        The ma- construction in Gumuz is simply a verb stem nominalized with the /ma-/
prefix. The resulting verbal noun exhibits the following structure: /ma-/ + verb stem +
/-a/ (the last item is discussed further in Chapter III, section 3.3.1.1). However, the final
/-a/ nominal marker is not always present in the ma- construction. For this reason, I
consider the ma- construction to be comprised of only the nominalizing prefix followed
by the verb stem. This construction forms the basis for many other verbal constructions in
Gumuz, namely complement clauses, the complements of auxiliaries, the progressive
construction, and negative imperatives. Adverbial clauses are also formed with the ma-
construction and are discussed in Chapter X. Nominal constructions which can be formed
with the ma- construction are discussed in Chapter VI and Chapter XII.","[385, 386, 387]"
"
7.1.3.1 Event Number
       Gumuz uses the nasal prefix /N-/ to encode multiple events or an iterative
repetition of the same event involving one or more participants. In NoG the verb stem
kwáa-kʼw means ‘return’ or ‘do again’. When /N-/ is added as in (7.87), the meaning
changes to ‘do again and again’. Here this derived verb form is used to help express the
repetitive action of a cow chewing its cud.",[226]
"
12.3.1.4       Relativizing on A Arguments
       With the bare relativizer strategy, one can relativize on an A argument by simply
substituting the affirmative main clause prefix /d-/ with the relativizer /l-/ and adding H
tone to the transitive tonal melody of the bound subject pronominal. The RC is assumed
to be internally headed (12.50 b), mirroring the more typical AVO word order of Gumuz
main clauses (12.50 a).   (12.50)     a.      ɓaga d-a-ɓátʃ          ŋ́gafa

                       ‘The person that hit the woman is here.’       It is also possible to have a headless RC using the bare relativizer /l-/ in order to
relativize on the A argument. In example (12.51), the O argument of the RC precedes the
verb, and the RC is externally headed. An /-a/ suffix is added to indicate that the NP
defore the verb is the O argument of the RC and the lexical A argument head is external
to the clause. In addition, H tone is added to the bound subject pronominal on the verb to
indicate that the clause is relativizing on an A argument. The resulting tonal pattern on
the bound subject pronominal of the transitive verb is HL. The addition of the H tone for
all other bound subject pronominals beyond the 3SG in this RC construction is not
detectable as the tonal melody for transitive non-3SG pronominals is H.",[438]

          Beyond mere NN compounds, internal possessors in Gumuz can be part of
genitive constructions (see Chapter V) as shown in (8.19a) above in which the genitive
prefix lá- (alá- in SoG) attaches to the possessor, dua ‘child’. 17 The possessor is followed
by the possessum ‘arm’ which has a possessive suffix /-má/ (3SG.POSS) conveying person
and number of the possessor.
          In Southern Gumuz, there are at least four ways of expressing the meaning ‘He hit
me in the eye’: two with internal possession constructions (8.46-8.47) and two with EP
constructions (8.48-8.49). The most common and accepted way of expressing this
statement (according to native speakers) is by means of the EP construction in example
(8.49).",[291]

12.3.2.5          ‘Where’/‘Place’ Relativization
         Another strategy for relativizing on a location is to use the relative pronoun /gó-/
‘where’. RCs introduced with /gó-/ ~ [gwá] may or may not have an overt head. If there
is an overt head, the clause is postnominal (12.117, 12.118). 24 In the nonfuture tense, the
affirmative prefix /b-/ is maintained under the same conditions as in main clause verbs
and the tonal marking on the bound subject pronominal is also the same as in main clause
verbs.","[458, 459]"

         Because both Irwin and Uzar had analyzed the same variety, Sese, Uzar adds as a
disclaimer that “there remains the possibility of non-trivial dialectal differences in verb
morphology” within Gumuz (1989:370). He reduces Irwin’s three verb types to two,
labeling them split and unsplit. 20 The root in the unsplit type stays intact while the root in
the split type is interrupted by the first part of a discontinuous suffix, -aka, and is then
followed by the last part of the verb root (1989:371).
         Uzar also provides data illustrating the future tense, remote past, as well as the
perfective, frequentive, and continuous aspects. In addition to tense and aspect, he
provides examples of jussive, conditional/irrealis, interrogative, and negative moods.
Lastly, Uzar provides a paradigm of person markers which seems to differ slightly from
those of Bender (1979).
         Uzar (1997) is an unpublished introductory course for the Gumuz language. Even
though the intended audience is not linguists, the booklet is somewhat of a linguistic
description of the language, complete with a consonant phoneme chart, phonological
rules, morphology and syntax. In this course booklet, Uzar revises his consonant
inventory to include labialized segments, perhaps due to Unseth’s comment that he
believed the labialized velars were diachronically moving toward phonemic status in the
language. The revised analysis includes thirty-eight consonants.
         Like Unseth, Uzar (1997) only posits two levels of tone for the Sese (SoG)
variety. He acknowledges, however, that sometimes a middle tone can be heard, but he
maintains that “middle tone seems to be not phonemically relevant (it is only a
predictable phonetic variant).” He subsequently gives examples of lexical items that
follow four “tone patterns:” high-high, low-low, high-low, and low-high (1997:10).
         As to comparative work with Gumuz dialects, Uzar provides a comparative chart
of numerals from the Gumuz spoken in Agelo Meti and Sirba Abay. He also reports that
the Gumuz in these two areas rely extensively on the numerals of a neighboring Cushitic
language, Oromo, especially for numbers higher than twenty (1997:36).","[46, 47]"
