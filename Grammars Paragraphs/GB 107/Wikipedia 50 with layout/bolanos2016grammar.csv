negative response to a polar question can be done by repeating the predicate of the

12.13 Responding to imperatives
        Responses to imperative clauses are constructed like responses to questions
(described in §12.10 above under interrogative polar and content questions).
Commands are usually responded to with the particle (interjection) hɨhɨ  ̃̂ ‘yes’, or
another particle with affirmative meaning (see Chapter 3 for a list of particles and
interjections in Kakua), such as da! ‘thereǃ’, among others. Additionally (as with
questions), imperatives can be responded to by repeating the predicate of the
imperative clause in a declarative construction. Example in (111) below illustrates a
response to a command:

        ‘yes, alright, I will tell (it to) Armadillo right now’      Negative responses to a command are also constructed like negative responses
to questions. A negative response may involve repeating the predicate in the
imperative clause, adding the negation marker -kan as illustrated in (112):112) A: beh-é

12.14 Summary
        This chapter describes the basic clause structure in Kakua. A minimal clause
contains at least one predicate. Given that cross-referencing proclitics can stand for
the subject NP of the clause, the overt expression of the subject NP is not obligatory
in order to form a clause. In basic clauses involving predicates with semantically
transitive verb roots, the object argument NP generally precedes the predicate of the
clause. Most other clause types also prefer the basic SOV order of constituents. An
exception to this is the imperative clause, which prefers an OSV order.
        The basic clause structures of copula constructions (affirmative and negative
copular clauses), predicative possessive clauses, comparatives, verbless clauses, and
basic locative clauses were described in sections §12.2 to §12.7 respectively. It was
also shown that nonverbal clauses represent a common strategy in Kakua to express
equative copular meanings.
        This chapter ended with a description of the structure and coding of
declarative, interrogative and imperative (both affirmative and negative) clauses in
§12.10 and §12.11. Kakua declarative clauses represent the default type of clause.
        Additionally, there is a morpheme which expresses an imperative mood for
when the request is to perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The origin
of this morpheme is obscure, and a diachronic explanation is still to be found in
order to have a more accurate approach to analyze the form. Future research,
342   A Grammar of Kakuaincluding perhaps a comparative analysis between Kakua, Nɨkak and other
neighboring languages, will undoubtedly presents us with fascinating hypotheses on
the origin of this form.

13.0 Introduction
       This chapter describes the different mechanisms for combining clauses in
Kakua. This complements chapter 9 where verb serialization was introduced as one
strategy that Kakua has to express a series of events when these events have an
integrated relationship among themselves. In addition to serialization, Kakua has two
other strategies to relate events to one another: coordination and subordination.
          i)       Coordination: the symmetrical relation of events, or events that are
conceptually less integrated.
          ii)      Subordination: an asymmetrical relation of events (clauses) in
which one depends, grammatically and semantically, on a higher clause, i.e.
subordination. Subordination is a strategy that falls in between the expression of
events that are considered as more conceptually integrated (verb serialization) and
events that are less conceptually integrated (coordination).
       Section §13.1 provides a description of the two main strategies of
coordination in Kakua: i) simple juxtaposition of the coordinated clauses; or ii) use
of a coordinator particle. 1 The specific properties of each subtype of subordinate
clauses (complement, relative, and adverbial) are described in §13.2-§13.5.","[361, 362, 363, 364]"

11.5 Summary
        The word order and alignment of arguments in Kakua can be summarized as
follows:
 Kakua shows a strong preference for the SOV ordering of its constituents.
     Alternative orders follow a preferentiality scale, from most preferred SOV to
     least preferred (but attested with restrictions) VOS.
 Most preferred orders are verb-final, with objects preceding the verb.
 The coding of subject arguments is of the head-marking type.
 Subject arguments are not morphologically marked for case.
 Kakua A arguments and S arguments are not different morphosyntactically. This
     conforms to a typical nominative-accusative type of alignment, where A and S
     arguments are equal, while different from P arguments: A=S≠P.
314    A Grammar of Kakua     The marking of object arguments is of the dependent-marking type. Nouns or
      NPs functioning as object arguments are marked by case with the case marker
      =diʔ.
     Differential Object Marking (DOM) criteria govern the overtness of
      morphological marking of object arguments.
     The object case marker =diʔ serves to mark NPs functioning as object
      arguments in several different semantic roles.
     The alignment of object arguments corresponds to a neutral type of object
      alignment, where P=T=R.

          Basic clause structure and types of clauses
12.0   Introduction
       This chapter describes the basic clause structure and the different clause types
in Kakua. Section §12.1 provides an introductory overview of the minimal
requirements to form a clause. Section §12.2 gives a description of copular
constructions involving predicative and existential copulas. In addition to affirmative
existential copulas, Kakua also has a negative existential copula; this type of negative
existential is described in §12.3. Section §12.4 gives a description of predicative
possession. This is followed by a description of comparative constructions in §12.5,
and non-verbal predicates expressing equation in §12.6. Finally, §12.7 provides a
description of the basic locative constructions.
       This chapter concludes with a description of Kakua clause types, presented in
4 subsections: declarative clauses in §12.9; interrogative clauses, both polar and
content interrogatives, in §12.10; imperative clauses in §12.11; and negative
imperative clauses in §12.12. Responses to imperative clauses are described in
§12.13, and a summary is found in §12.14.
12.1   Minimal clause
        A basic sentence in Kakua is composed of at least one independent clause.
An intransitive clause is minimally composed of a predicate (with optional
indexation of the subject by means of a cross-referencing proclitic), as in (1); or an
optional subject NP and a predicate, as in (2), where the subject NP typically
precedes the predicate (SV). Transitive clauses minimally contain a predicate;
additionally, transitive clauses typically contain an overt object NP (though not
obligatorily); the subject NP is optional, and it may be indexed on the predicate by
means of cross-referencing proclitics (3), which are themselves also optional (see
Chapter 11 for description of criteria governing the occurrence of proclitics). In
transitive clauses, the object NP typically precedes the predicate of the clause (SOV)
(4)-(6).                   ̃̌ ʔ=hĩ

12.2     The affirmative existential copular verb hɨm
        The affirmative existential verb hɨm is used in predicative and existential
copular constructions to encode existence, and also permanent states and attribution,
as discussed in this section. Equative constructions in Kakua use a different strategy,
and are formed by the juxtaposition of the NPs without the use of the existential verb
hɨm (see §12.6 below). Note that the verb hɨm ‘exist’, which is referred to as a copula
here, can function as a predicate on its own, whereas the canonical definition of
copulas expects copulas to not be able to function as predicates on their own right;
see Hengeveld (1992). Examples below illustrate copula constructions in Kakua,
using the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ in its different functions to express permanent
states, existence/location, and attribution:7) jeděʔ-wã    jěb    hɨm=nit

    ‘Hamu is very sadǃ       The basic structure of predicative and existential copular constructions in
Kakua does not differ from that shown for other types of verbal constructions
(intransitive, monotransitive, ditransitive), in which the verb is (preferably) in final
position, being preceded by the object and the subject/agent arguments: SOV( cop).
Thus, a copular construction is also preferably of the type SOV. The copular verb in
Kakua takes all of the verbal morphology (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of verbal
morphology). This include interrogative mood (14) and tense and aspect (14)-(17)
(see also the examples above in this section), cross-referencing proclitics,
morphemes indicating evidentiality, as in (16), and nominalizers, as in (17):

318      A Grammar of Kakua12.3     The negative existential verb wîʔikan
        In addition to the affirmative existential copular verb hɨm, Kakua has an
inherently negative stative verb wîʔikan denoting the meanings of ‘not to have or not
to exist’. This form can be further analyzed into two morphemes, a verb root wîʔi-
and the verbal negation suffix –kan. However, the root wîʔi- is obligatorily bound
and cannot occur without the negation suffix –kan, and this verb is thus considered
to be a single negative existential expression. The negative existential verb, like other
Kakua verbs, takes all the verbal morphology available to verbs in general: cross-
referencing proclitics (18); TAM affixes (18)-(20), evidentiality prefixes and/or
enclitics (as in (18)-(20)), and derivational suffixes to form adjectives (21):18) hiw=bɨt                  ʔã=t-wîʔikan=na

negative response to a question (of the English type ‘no’) as exemplified below:22) Q. ʔã=t-ʔên=nit                ʔã=t-bìdi=nit=hĩ

       ‘did he look? did he search?’       A wîʔikan
         ‘no’       Although the affirmative existential verb hɨm can also be negated by attaching
the negation suffix -kan to it, Kakua speakers strongly prefer using the negative
existential wîʔikan, when the predicative or existential clause is negative. Negating

"
12.10 Interrogative clauses
12.10.0 Interrogative clauses
        Kakua has two main types of interrogative clauses: Content (or question-
word) interrogative clauses, and polar (yes-no) interrogative clauses. Content
questions (§12.10.2 below) are formed by using interrogative pronouns or other
interrogative words like interrogative demonstratives and/or adverbials (see Chapter
7 on interrogative pronouns and question words). Polar interrogative clauses
(§12.10.1 below), on the other hand, are morphologically marked by the clitic =nit.
Interrogative clauses contrast with declarative clauses in that the declarative marker
=na does not occur in interrogative clauses. They do not differ from declarative
clauses in word order. Also no particular intonational pattern is required to
exclusively mark interrogative clauses (although in future work intonation patterns
in interrogative clauses should be looked at carefully).. Interrogative clauses can be
both affirmative and negative. When negative, the verbal predicate must be marked
by the negation suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’, or the negative existential wîɁikan ‘not.exist’
is used. Compare the following examples:54) wã=ʔip    ma-=hiʔ̃́            ʔã=hɨm=nit=be

    ‘what do you not know?’       Interrogative clauses differ further from declarative clauses (§12.9 above) in
that interrogative clauses have not been found to occur with the entire range of
evidentiality distinctions (I have found them occuring only with the inferred
evidential markers). Further research should focus on specifically testing for
acceptance of each of the evidential markers in interrogative clauses and explore the
reasons why some (at least the inferred category) are allowed to occur whereas other
categories are not. Examples (55) above and (58) below illustrate interrogative
clauses occurring with the inferred evidential. It is interesting to note that evidential
markers can occur in interrogative clauses, even though one might think that
evidential marking presupposes assertion.
       Additionally, the interrogative marker can also co-occur with the dubitative
mood suffix -hi ‘DUB’ in the same clause, as illustrated in (60) below. See Chapter
10 for further descriptions of interaction of the interrogative mood with evidentiality
and other mood markers.58) měm       ma=ta-naʔa-beh=ta=nit

    ‘maybe you want to go?’       Polar interrogative clauses and content interrogative clauses differ in that
polar questions must obligatorily be marked with the interrogative mood clitic =nit,
while in interrogative clauses formed with question words, the presence of = nit is
optional, and it is most often omitted.","[348, 349]"

12.9   Declarative clauses
        Declarative clauses in Kakua are those expressing statements (in the sense of
Palmer 2001:65). Declarative clauses are morphologically marked by the clitic =na.
Note, however, that in many cases the declarative marker does not occur. The criteria
predicting the omission, or facultative marking, of the declarative clitic, are left for
future research.
        From a formal perspective declarative clauses do not have special
phonological features (like, for example, dedicated intonation, or other phonological
traits to be found exclusively in declarative clauses) nor do they have a special
constituent order. Declarative clauses can express affirmative or negative statements,
as seen in the examples in (48)-(49) below:48) kǎn=diʔ             ʔɨbʔ                wã=bèw=na=hĩ

12.11 Imperative clauses
         Imperative clauses in Kakua are formed by reduplication of the last vowel of
the verb root of the predicate of the imperative clause. The reduplicated vowel
receives an obligatory high tone. The imperative suffix is then by default represented
as -Ṽ́ , where the quality of the vowel is the same as that of the last vowel of the
verb root. This is illustrated in examples (90)-(105):90) ɲi=tɨ ̀j-huj-ú
    2PL=be.good-listen-IMP
    ‘listen carefully!’91) hemʔ-é
    eat-IMP
    ‘eat!’
336     A Grammar of Kakua92) wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-á=buhú
    1SG=OBJ tell-IMP=DIR
    ‘tell me’5       Like all Kakua clauses, imperative clauses in Kakua are typically verb-final.
Kakua often omits the overt expression of subject NP arguments (although their overt
expression is considered acceptable by speakers, they judge them to be redundant),
for they are usually referred to by means of cross-referencing proclitics on the verb
predicate. Imperative clauses in Kakua tend to omit the subject argument of the
clause more often than other clauses (a cross-linguistic common characteristic of
imperative clauses; c.f., Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171; Aikhenvald 2010:92-97, and
Chapter 2 of the same book). The omission of the subject argument of the clause
occurs more frequently with 2SG forms than with 2PL forms; however, this omission
can be said to be facultative, since instances of the 2PL where the subject argument
is omitted can also occur when context is sufficient to allow for it. The verb root
plus the imperative marker -Ṽ́, without need of further affixes or clitics, can function
as an imperative clause by itself (also a cross-linguistically common feature of
imperative clauses Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171). If additional TAME distinctions
occur, they form a separate clause. Imperative clauses without an overt proclitic are
interpreted by default as having a second person singular subject (93)-(94). Examples
(95) and (96) illustrate imperatives with overt 2PL and 2SG proclitic pronouns
respectively:93) fwɨb-ɨ ̃́
    return-IMP
    ‘come back!’94) ɲaw-á
    run-IMP
    ‘run!’95) ɲi=nêʔ-é                    tɨ ̀j-wẽp-ni
    2PL=press-IMP                 be.good-be.strong-ADJVZ
    ‘press strongly!’96) ma=tiw-í
    2SG=shot.with.blowgun=IMP
    ‘shoot!’
         5
             This example can also be analyzed as wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-ábuhú 1SG=OBJ tell-IMP2, where ‘IMP2’,
is an imperative concerning an action for the benefit of someone else. See the description of this
construction at the end of this section.
                                   Basic clause structure and types of clauses    337       Imperatives can also be used to give commands to other than a 2 nd person
(singular or plural) participants. This is done by adding the appropriate proclitic
pronoun in the imperative construction:97) mi=Ɂên-é
    3SG.F=see=IMP
    ‘may she see!’
98) mi=têw-é
    3SG.F=work=IMP
    ‘may she work!’        Constituent order in imperative clauses is somewhat different from that in
declarative clauses. Imperative clauses do have a verb final order. But if the subject
argument is fully expressed by an NP, then the subject argument most often
immediately precedes the verb. It then follows the object rather than preceding it as
in other clauses, with an OSV order as the result. The fronting of the object argument
in an imperative clause is not an uncommon cross-linguistic feature of imperatives
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97). This ordering of imperative clauses in Kakua is
illustrated in examples (99)-(101) below:99) kan=diʔ měm          ma= fwẽh-é
    3SG=OBJ 2SG           2SG=leave-IMP
    ‘leave it!’100) bab-ni=diʔ                    měm     ma=dúk-ú
     be.white-ADJVZ=OBJ            2SG      2SG=sift-IMP
   ‘sift the manioc drink!’101) wã=pebʔ           měm       ma=ɲɨʔ-hɨwʔ-ɨ ̃́
     1SG=be.near        2SG        2SG=stand-come-IMP
     ‘you come stand by me!’       The only evidentiality marker that can occur in combination with imperative
clauses in Kakua is the reported evidential =wɨt, possibly together with the prefix
t- ‘EVID’ (prefix of second hand, nonsensorial evidentiality. See Chapter 10 on
evidentiality) to express that the order has been given by someone other than the
speaker. The use of the reported evidential marker usually serves also to attenuate
the force of the command, making it a more polite imperative. This is often used
when directing orders to elders (102)-(103). Note that the additional evidentiality
specification forms a separate clause, so cannot be directly combined with the
imperative verb:

     ‘take (the manioc) out for grating, it is said’        In fact, imperative clauses in Kakua lack all TAME distinctions in the clause
itself, and all of these distinctions form a separate clause. Cross-linguistically
speaking, this is not an uncommon characteristic of imperative clauses (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985).
        An additional construction expressing imperative solicits the addressee to
perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The form of this imperative is
-áʔbuhú and it is glossed here as ‘IMP2’. In constructions using this morpheme, the
subject is always a second person, and its overt expression may be omitted. See
examples (104)-(105) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’. This
form can only code a ‘beneficial’ imperative, and no other benefactive or dative like
meanings can be drawn from it.104) ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ                nih-áʔbuhú
     take=DECL=ASS=D.S               say-IMP2
     ‘(she) is recording, (you) tell her!’105) kǎn=diʔ ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
     3SGM=OBJ take.out-IMP2
     ‘take (it) out for him’       Synchronically, -áʔbuhú is considered here to be one single morpheme.
However, because of the phonological (syllabic structure, vowel harmony) structure
of Kakua words, it is likely that that -áʔbuhú is historically at least a complex form.
The etymology of this imperative is not transparent.6
         6
          It might be a lexicalized combination of a morpheme -áʔ and the directional clitic=buh ‘DIR’.
The first element could be a phonologically reduced form of the negative suffix -kan, or it might
correspond to a morpheme that is no longer used in synchronic Kakua. Note that the negative suffix
doesn’t support a semantic motivation for this ‘beneficial’ imperative. Perhaps, the source of the proposed
first element -áɁ, expressed similar semantics of performing an action on behalf of a third party.
Nonetheless, there is no evidence neither in Kakua nor in its sister language Nɨkak that allows me to
strongly claim this hypothesis. The second element of this form would be the directional clitic =buh
‘DIR’, displaying the addition of a reduplicated vowel and high tone, i.e. the regular way to form
imperatives -Ṽ́. I propose the directional clitic as the most likely source of this element in this imperative
marker because of the semantics of this clitic, which comes from a verb root meaning ‘to perform an
action from a distance’ (see note at the end of Chapter 8 regarding the fuzzy verbal-directional identity
                                            Basic clause structure and types of clauses              33912.12 Negative imperative
       Negative imperative clauses require the negative imperative suffix -kabuhú.
This is also clearly a complex morpheme, historically derived from at least two
morphemes. The first part of this morpheme can be identified as the negative suffix
marker -kan/-kap. The second part, however, is less clear, and can have at least two
interpretations. Firstly, it may relate to the directional clitic =buh ‘DIR’, or to the
emphasis function of the clitic =bǔ ‘EMPH’ (see Chapter 8), plus a reduplication of
its vowel. As for now, I have no strong evidence for either of these hypotheses, but
what is clear is that (as with the second imperative described in §12.11 above), given
Kakua’s phonological and morphological rules, this particular negative imperative
morpheme can be considered historically as a complex form.
       The negative imperative morpheme must immediately follow the verb root
(to which no affirmative imperative can be attached): (PN)=Verb-kabuhú :106) ma=ʔɨm-kabuhú
     2SG=be.afraid-NEG.IMPER
     ‘don’t be afraid!’
of this morpheme). Thus, performing on behalf, or for the benefit of somebody else can be equated to
performing an action from a distance. Whenever the clause refers to this specific semantics of performing
an action for the benefit of somebody else, the imperative is expressed with this obscure morpheme
-áʔbuhú, thus it is considered here as one single complex morpheme. In constructions using this
morpheme, the subject argument of the clause is always in the second person, and it may be omitted. See
examples (i)-(ii) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’:
(i)         ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ                       nih-áʔbuhú
            take.out=DECL=ASS=D.S                  say-IMP2
            ‘(she) is recording, tell her!’
(ii)        kǎn=diʔ                ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
            3SGM=OBJ                take.out-IMP2
            ‘take (it) out for him’
Since it seems to have a beneficial encoding (perform for the benefit of someone else), the following
considerations might be relevant for a future study of this imperative: i) Kakua does not have a dedicated
marker for benefactive roles (see discussion in Chapter 6), ii) many Vaupés languages also do not have
dedicated markers for benefactive roles; iii) Kakua does not have a dative case marker (another possible
source for the development of a benefactive encoding of a form). If the source were a dative case marker,
however, it would be necessary to explain why and how a case marker becomes a verbal morpheme; iv)
many Vaupés languages have been described to lack a dative marker; v) Nɨkak, Kakua’s sister language,
has been described as making five case distinctions, among which a dative; vi) Kakua, as many of its
neighboring groups in the Vaupés, makes three morphological distinctions, for case: Object arguments,
Locatives, and Comitative and Instrumental; vii) Nɨkak’s dative marker is -éʔ (see Mahecha 2009); viii)
there is a regular sound correspondence of Nɨkak /e/ to Kakua /a/. This may be relevant for the complex
benefactive imperative form in Kakua -áʔbuhú; ix) because of Kakua’s phonological (syllabic structure,
vowel harmony) and morphological rules, we know that -áʔbuhú imperative is a complex form.

not contain TAME marking. If the reportative evidential is used, it does not attach
to the predicate together with the negative imperative, but it rather occurs forms
another clause (as in (107) above), and (110) below. The use of a reportative
construction seems to serve a function of making the command more ‘soft’, or more
polite:110) kět=diʔ             Katherine         ma=tû-kabuhú

      ‘Katherine, don’t push them! they have said’       As seen in (110) above, constituent order in negative imperatives clauses is
typically verb final; and whenever both the subject and object are overtly expressed
through a lexical noun or free pronoun, the order of subject and object is inverted
from the typical SOV basic order in Kakua, resulting in OSV (although speakers
accept other orders). The change of the preferred order into an OSV order is typical
for imperative clauses cross-linguistically (c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97).","[356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361]"

12.10.1 Polar interrogative clauses
      Polar questions seek a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. This type of clause is obligatorily
marked by the interrogative clitic =nit.3 The interrogative clitic is in complementary
        3
            Note that the interrogative morpheme is homophonous with the same-subject enclitic =nit ‘S.S’
(Chapter 13) and the plural collective –nit ‘PL.COL’ (Chapter 4). Whether there is a historic relation
between these forms has yet to be explored in future research.

with the same hosts as the declarative marker =na; that is, interrogative =nit can

    ‘is he the crab?’       Common greetings in Kakua are similar to polar questions, but the
interrogative marker =nit is often omitted in these. These greetings do not elicit
information, as they refer to an action for which the speaker has clear direct evidence
and thus doesn’t require an answer. Note that, since the declarative marker can be
omitted in declarative clauses, the type of clauses presented below can alternatively
be analyzed as declarative clauses. The examples below illustrate a morning greeting
(65) and arrival greetings (66)-(67):

    ‘have you arrived?’67) ma=tɨ ̃̂j
    2SG=be.good
    ‘how are you?’ (lit. you good)        Departure greetings do require the interrogative clitic. Example (68)
illustrates the typical greeting directed towards those who are leaving. Again, it does
not elicit information, as it is used even when the process of leaving is taking place
in the presence of the speaker.68) ma=beh=nit
    2SG=go=INTERR
    ‘are you leaving?’        Another exception to obligatory marking with the interrogative clitic =nit in
polar questions occurs in traditional Kakua storytelling. This practice requires one
or more “responders” whose role in the event is to respond to the person telling the
story. The response often consists of repeating the last sentence of the main narrator.
This “response” can be understood as a question,4 but the interrogative marker =nit
is not required. Example (69) below comes from a story-telling event of a folktale.
Speaker A is telling the story, and speaker B is the designated “responder”. His or
her duty is to ask questions to the speaker while the story is being told. Speaker B
asks the questions without using the interrogative marker =nit. When inquired about
this, speakers reported that everybody assumes that the denominated “responder” is
asking questions, and therefore the use of the interrogative marker =nit was
considered redundant (although possible):
         4
             I assume this because it is the only accepted translation that speakers give, and also because the
main narrator gives an affirmative answer. Also, when having conversations in Spanish with me, the
Kakua speakers will use the same formula, though in Spanish they will use the interrogative intonation to
indicate that the repetition of the sentence said by one of the speakers represents a ‘rhetorical question’,
or just a figure of speech.

       Question-word interrogative clauses elicit specific information (as opposed to

see below). A list of interrogative words (discussed in Chapter 7) is given in Table

       The following sections provide descriptions of the different types of
independent clauses in Kakua. Declarative clauses are described in §12.9, followed
by a section describing interrogative polar and content questions (§12.10). Section
§12.11 provides a description of affirmative imperative clauses and §12.12 of
negative imperatives. These sections show that these types of clauses differ in their
possibility of encoding evidential categories.
       All of these clause types have dedicated markers, as given in Table 11.2
below. Additional description and exemplification of these markers are also
presented in other chapters. Chapter 10 on TAME describes the meanings of these
markers in the context of other markers encoding mood, e.g., frustrative, dubitative,
and other moods. Chapter 8 gives a basic template of the verb and describes the
syntactic position of these markers within the verbal word.","[346, 347]"

constituents, forming independent interrogative utterances. Question words standing

accompanied by an intensifier or emphasis marker (e.g., dêɁe=tiɁ ‘who=INTS

     ‘how were you all people born, where were you all, where were you all born?’       Question words can also be omitted in constructing content questions, if an

following example:83) Q: pǎʔ=ka
       dad=ASS
       ‘(where is) dad?’     A: tâʔ             ʔã=têw=na

334    A Grammar of Kakua12.10.3 Responding to interrogatives
       Content questions are typically answered with a (declarative) clause, or with
a single word that provides the particular information solicited.
       Polar (yes-no) questions can be responded to positively in two ways: with the
                       ̃̂ ‘yes, aha’ (84)-(85) or by repeating in a declarative form the
affirmative particle hɨhɨ
verb phrase that appeared in the interrogative (86)-(87). Subjects are frequently
dropped, as in (84) and (86).","[352, 353, 354, 355]"
"
10.4.3 Imperative mood: –Ṽ́ ‘IMP’, -kabuhú ‘NEG.IMP’, and -ʔabuhú ‘IMP2’
       The last category of illocution is the imperative mood. The imperative mood
expresses commands. Commands in Kakua can be expressed by three different
markers that encode specific types of commands. A positive command, which is
marked with the suffix -Ṽ́, a negative command, marked with the suffix -kabuhú,
and a command that solicits an action to be performed for the benefit of someone
else, marked with the suffix -ʔabuhú.
         Like declarative and interrogative moods, the imperative moods can serve
to form types of clauses. The host of the imperative suffixes is the predicate (or verb
as in Table 10.3). Examples of these three imperative markers are given below:59) kan=diʔ měm                 ma=fwẽh-é
    3SG=OBJ 2SG                  2SG=leave-IMP
    ‘leave it!’60) ma=beh-kabuhú                ʔĩ=pĩ-nih=na=wɨt=hĩ
    2SG=go-NEG.IMP               3PL=HAB-say=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST
    ‘don’t go, they always said’61) kǎn=diʔ              ʔɨ ̃̂b-áʔbuhú
    3SGM=OBJ              take.out-IMP2
    ‘take it out (for somebody else)’        10
            Note that, unlike the interrogative, the dubitative modality does not express a question, given
that the category of modality, as adopted here from Hengeveld (2004), does not have the ability to form
clause types. A question is a type of clause, whereas the dubitative modality expresses doubt, and not
necessarily a question. See the description on dubitative modality in §10.5.1 below.
                                         Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality     287        Usually additional modality (and tense and aspect) distinctions are not
expressed in imperative clauses. Whenever the clause is further specified for these
distinctions, the TAME markers occur on another element of the clause, which can
take all of the needed TAME morphology:62) ma=ʔɨb-ɨ ̃́          hit-at              pînaʔ   nih=wɨt=hĩ
    2SG=take.out-IMP grate-NMLZ              POT      say=REP.EVID=REM.PST
    ‘take out (the manioc) for grating, it is said’         More information on the different imperative markers and the type of
clauses that they form is given in Section §12.11.","[307, 308]"
"
          Position 1: Proclitics
        Kakua (virtually always) indexes the subject argument of the clause by means
of cross-referencing proclitics (see Chapter 6 for description of subject indexing on
the verb and exceptions to its obligatoriness, and Chapter 11 on alignment). These
proclitics agree in number and person with the subject argument of the clause, and
also in gender for 3rd person singular subjects (often no overt subject NP is needed).
Example in (17) below illustrates the use of a 1st person singular subject proclitic
with no overt subject noun phrase:17) baj-ni-bit            wã=hêjʔ
    be.small-ADJVZ-DIM 1SG=know
    ‘I know a little bit’
         Position 2: Prefixes: evidentiality
       Prefixes encoding evidential and aspectual meanings occur in the second slot
of the verb word. These prefixes cannot occur without a preceding proclitic. One of
these second position prefixes t-/ti- encodes secondhand evidentiality, expressing
                                           The verb: morphology and structure          247that the statement was not sensed, directly heard, or witnessed by the speaker. This
evidential prefix often occurs together with the reported evidential enclitic in the
same word (see Chapter 10 for the description of evidentiality in Kakua). An example
is given in (18):18) tʃèj kãk  ʔã=ti-beh-ep=wɨt=hĩ                     hunhatiʔ
    night       person 3SG.M=EVID-go-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST LONG.AGO
    ‘Long ago, a person went out at night (it is said)’       Other meanings that are expressed by prefixes occurring in this slot are:
inferred evidentiality t-/ta-, as illustrated in (19) and (20); habitual aspect, as in (21);
and non-visual evidentiality (see examples in Section §10.6).        ̂ ã=diʔ

     ‘They didn’t tell me’ (I assume since they usually don't tell me)
         Position 3: Prefix: reciprocal and reflexive
       Position 3 can be filled only with the reflexive/reciprocal prefix mǐk-. This
reflexive/reciprocal prefix can fill the pre-stem position required by verb words
without needing to be preceded by a proclitic. Example (22) below illustrates the
reflexive/reciprocal prefix being preceded by a proclitic (position 1) and an inferred
evidential prefix (position 2):22) ʔĩ=t-mǐk-pâʔ-ap=hĩ
    3PL=INF.EVID-RFLX/REC-break.in.half-PST=REM.PST
    ‘They broke themselves apart’ (they took different paths by themselves)       The prefix mǐk- ‘RFLX/REC’ in Kakua is the only morpheme that changes the
valency of the verb to which it attaches. It serves to encode both reflexive and
reciprocal meanings. These are illustrated in (23) for the reciprocal meaning, and
(24) for the reflexive meaning of the prefix:
248    A Grammar of Kakua23) fĩ=mǐk-fwãʔ=na=ka                      ʔinwɨʔá

    ‘We meet each other, my relative!’24) mâ-dǔbʔ=hĩʔ          mi=t-mík-pũj-ũp=wɨt=be
    tree-CL:pointed=COM 3SG.F=EVID-RFLX-hit/whip-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
    ‘she whipped herself with a vein (it’s said)’       Whether this prefix expresses reciprocal or reflexive depends on the context.
With a singular subject, as in example (25) (see also example (24)), a reciprocal
reading is not possible. Verbs with plural subjects, as in (26), on the other hand, can
have either a reciprocal or a reflexive meaning. The context determines the
interpretation as either one or the other:25) kǎn=héʔ              ʔã=mík-bûd
    3SG.M=EMPH             3SG.M=RFLX-cut
    ‘he cut himself’26) kět         ʔĩ=t-mík-bûd=be
    3PL         3PL=EVID-RECIP-cut=REC.PST
    ‘they cut each other’ or ‘they cut themselves’        Verbs that include the reflexive/reciprocal prefix can drop the subject proclitic
if reference is sufficiently clear from the context, like with other verb forms. This is
illustrated in (27) below:27) victor-ĩʔ             mɨ=bǔ=hĩ                    fĩ=hɨm-ɨp=hĩ

      REFL/RECIP-chat=DECL         1PL=PROG=REM.PST
      ‘we were at Victor’s house, chatting (among ourselves)’       Additionally, the reflexive/reciprocal prefix can have a use different from the
encoding of reciprocal or reflexive meaning. Instead, it can have an intensifying use,
similar to ‘self’ in English. This is illustrated in the following example:28) ma=mǐk-wẽp-hâ=na
    2SG=RFLX/RECIP-be.strong-wake.up=DECL
    ‘eat your breakfast yourself’
      Position 5: Suffixes: imperatives
      Position 5 can be filled by affirmative imperative -V́, the negative imperative
-kabuhú, and the imperative on the benefit of someone else -Ɂabuhú. The different

verbs inflected for imperative mood (for more examples of imperatives, including
the imperative for the benefit of someone else, see Chapter 12):29) ma=jàp-ʧɨ ̂jʔ-beh-é
    2SG=pass-step.on-go-IMP
    ‘walkǃ’30) ma=tîw-kabuhú
    2SG=play-NEG.IMP
    ‘Don’t play!’        Note that both the imperative and the negative imperative suffixes occur in
final position in the examples presented above. I do not have evidence in my corpus
to tell whether these suffixes can occur together with other suffixes or if their position
is later within the template.","[268, 269, 270, 271]"

12.4     Predicative possession constructions
       Kakua has two main strategies to express possession. Firstly, the juxtaposition
of the possessor and the possessed NPs, with the possessive marker -ǐʔ suffixed to
the possessor NP for alienable possession, and without the possessive marker for
inalienable possession (see Chapter 5). Secondly, possession can be expressed by
means of a predicative construction (i.e. predicative possession). Predicative
possessive constructions involve the stative possessive verb bibùʔ ‘have/possess’.
The constituent order in predicative possessive constructions is consistent with
Kakua’s preferred SOV order. Thus, the possessor, most often animate, precedes the
possessed NP (usually inanimate), and the verb is at the end of the construction.
Constructions using this verb are illustrated in examples (23)-(26) below:23) badʔdaʔ         telu-ʧaʔ                    bɨdǐ
    deceased        quiver-CL:container         be.big       ʔĩ=t-bibùʔ=hip=tagǎ

    child         cold     3SG.M=have=DECL=ASS
    ‘the child has a cold’       As seen in the examples above, the predicative possessive verb ‘have’ bibùʔ
takes the common verbal morphology (e.g., subject cross-reference proclitics, tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality). The possessed NP of a predicative possessive
construction is not case marked, even when DOM criteria apply (see Chapter 6).
320    A Grammar of Kakua12.5   Comparative constructions
        The function of comparative constructions in Kakua is to assign the relative
position of two referents on a predicative scale. Comparative constructions,
according to the terminology used in Stassen (1985), involve the following elements:
the standard of comparison (the NP indicating the object that serves as the yardstick
of the comparison); the comparee (the object that is being compared); the parameter
(the property on which the comparison is based), and the index (referring to the type
of comparison). The last two, i.e. the parameter and the index, are referred to as the
scale.
        Kakua comparative constructions include those in which the scale of
comparison expresses standards referred to as being less than, more than, and equal
to the compared entity. In these types of constructions, the scale is expressed by verb
roots, without additional TAME morphology, affixes or proclitics. In these cases, the
verb root by itself indicates the scale of comparison. Examples (27)-(29) illustrate
the use of the verb tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’ not functioning as a predicate, but as a scale for
comparison. The order of constituents in comparative constructions is as follows: the
comparee precedes the standard, and the position of the scale of comparison (e.g.,
tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’) is free.27) newě=bǔ jad-wili             tʃaʔ               hap=bǔ=ka

    ‘he is uglier than a flea’       Example (30) involves the use of the verb nɨmʔ ‘be.below’ as a scale for
comparison meaning ‘be less than’. Note that in these examples, as in (27)-(29) above
and (30) below, the verb expressing the scale for comparison does not take additional
TAM affixes and its function within the clause is not that of a predicate, but of a
scale of comparison:

    ‘like this short, the younger brother was shorter (than the older ones), just like
    Chavela’        Semblative comparison, in which the standard and the comparee are
conceived to be of equal degree on a given scale, are formed by using different
particles encoding meanings such as ‘be alike’, ‘like this’, ‘and so like this’, ‘be
equal’, ‘be similar to’. Choosing one particle or another depends primarily on
whether or not the speaker can physically signal the relative dimension of the
standard of comparison, and on the physical proximity of the speaker to the standard
of comparison. For example, if the speaker points to a tree in the distance as the
yardstick for comparison of height, then the particle paniʔna ‘and so like this’ (or its
shortened allomorph panʔ) would be used. This particle is also used whenever the
standard of comparison is not visually accessible. If instead the speaker physically
touches the yardstick of comparison, or uses gestures to indicate its dimensions, then
most often the particle mɨn ‘be equal’ is used.
        Example (30) above, highlights the use of particles mɨn ‘be equal’, and paʔniʔ
‘be alike/be like this’. During the utterance of the first line in the example, the
speaker was indicating how short the younger brother is with a hand gesture, by
placing one hand below with the palm of the hand facing upwards, and the other
hand higher up with its palm facing downwards. In this case the speaker uses the
particle mɨn ‘be equal’. Then, the speaker pointed at Chavela (a young girl listening
to the conversation), expressing that ‘the younger brother’ in the tale was about her
size; for this comparison the speaker uses the particle paʔniʔ ‘be alike/be like this’.
        Additional examples of semblative comparatison are given in (31)-(33) below.

where the nominalized verb jǔb ‘be true’ serves to express that the referent of the
noun keh ‘fish’ is the biggest among the referents of the standard of comparison
noun bita ‘others’. These examples additionally illustrate that the noun phrase
expressing the standard can be case-marked. Maybe this indicates that the standard
is regarded as a syntactic object. There is no explanation why it is that sometimes
comparees are object marked while other times they are not (the animacy hierarchy
governing DOM does not seem to predict object marking in these cases).34) newě        niʔat=diʔ          tʃaʔ               hap=bǔ

12.6    Non-verbal predicates
        Non-verbal predicates occur in verbless clauses that are formed by the
juxtaposition of two NPs without a verb. The subject argument always occurs clause-
initially in this type of clauses. Verbless clauses are used to express equative
relations, including identity, class inclusion, and class membership. Examples in
(36)-(39) below illustrate verbless clauses:36) kǎn          fwĩʔ=wâw-daʔ
    3SG.M         1PL.POSS=head-CL:round

          1SG=pass-PST-FUT
          ‘I am going to pass to you the ancient songs, now that you are a man,’       Note that an alternative analysis of these constructions may seem to be that
the copula has been omitted, i.e. as ‘zero copula’ construction. According to the
standard definition of copula constructions (Hengeveld 1992, Pustet 2003, and
especially Stassen 1994), a ‘zero copula’ type of construction presupposes that there
is a syntactic slot that is otherwise filled by another element, or in which a copula
occurs optionally under certain grammatical criteria. The examples shown in this
subsection, however, are not considered here as copula constructions with a zero
copula, because it is not the case that in these constructions a syntactic slot remains
empty in a restricted context, while alternating with an overt copula in some other
contexts. The examples presented in this section do not have alternatives with an
overt copula.
       Additionally, the simple juxtaposition of related elements in Kakua is a very
common strategy to express many different types of relations (e.g., derivation of
nouns Chapter 5, possession Chapter 5, coordination of clauses Chapter 13). It should
not be surprising then that expressing these more ‘permanent’ states of being (as
opposed to the less permanent states of being illustrated in the examples in section
§12.2) also appeal to the juxtaposition of elements as a way to express these more
permanent states of being.","[340, 341, 342, 343, 344]"

kan-ni has an unidentified element pêjʔ, which, at this moment, remains unglossed.
In the currently available Kakua data, no source form can be identified. Presumably,
this unidentified morpheme is (or was) a verbal root because it is followed by
morphology that is exclusive to verbal elements: the verbal suffixes –kan ‘NEG’, and
–ni ‘A.NMLZ’ or ‘ADJVZ’. Possibly, this unidentified element pêjʔ is related to a blend
of the verbs roots peh-hɨm ‘be.friends/be.together-exist’ or to the compound of peh-
wîʔi-kan ‘be.friend-not.exist-NEG’. Whether or not the unidentified element pêjʔ
corresponds to a diachronic compound is thus not clear.
                                                      Elements of the noun phrase       223        The motivation for proposing a source relating to a meaning of ‘be.together’
plus an additional morphological element, relies on two facts: i) many Eastern
Tukanoan languages have a clear etymological source for the numeral ‘four’ with a
meaning similar to ‘having a companion’ (see Huber & Reed 1992 for Eastern
Tukanoan languages Tatuyo, Barasano, Tuyuka, Yurutí, Makuna, Piratapuyo,
Siriano, Karapano). Thus, extrapolating this logic to the Kakua term for ‘three’, it
could be translated into ‘that who does not have a companion’. ii) This directs the
hypothesis of thinking that possibly the form was constructed from a, previously,
complex compound involving the negative existential morpheme wîʔi-kan ‘not.exist-
NEG’, or the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ which was attached to the verb péh meaning
‘be.together’, or ‘be friends’. Example (37) below was found in a Kakua text, in this
case, not referring to the numeral three in itself, but to an odd numbered item. Here
the speaker was counting pairs of seeds, when one seed was standing by itself in the
line of paired seeds:37) bǐʔ             tib

     ‘one seed was odd (didn’t have a partner)’        Forms for numerals 6-20 are based on terms for hands, feet, fingers and toes,
added to the terms for numerals one, two, and three. These are shown in Table 7.6
below.
        Note that in the glosses given for these lexemes, sometimes the plural
morpheme given is the animate plural -wã (e.g., ʧênewã ‘two’) or the inanimate
plural -na (e.g., ʧênna ‘two’, ʧênenamîk ‘four’). The use of either plural animate or
plural inanimate is determined by the animacy of the enumerated noun: if it is
inanimate (ʧênna mɨ ̃̌ ‘two houses’) the plural form used in the numerals is the
inanimate plural -na ‘IN.PL’. If it is animate (ʧênwã kãk ‘two persons’) the plural
form used in the numeral is the animate plural suffix -wã.","[244, 245]"

10.2.1 Habitual aspect: prefix pĩ-
       The verbal prefix pĩ- encodes habitual aspect. Semantically, it refers to an
event or situation that occurs habitually or frequently for an extended period of time.
The semantics of this prefix conforms to the general definition of habituality, as
given in Comrie (1976:27f): “the feature that is common to all habituals […], is that
they describe a situation which is characteristic of an extended period of time, so
extended in fact that the situation referred to is viewed not as an incidental property
of the moment but, precisely, as a characteristic feature of a whole period.”
Sentences marked with the habitual prefix are translated with the similar habitual
adverb in English ‘usually’, or ‘always’. Some examples follow:
                                                 Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality              27527) niʔat=diʔ            wã=pĩ-hêjʔ-kan=ka
    every=OBJ            1SG=HAB-know-NEG=ASS
    ‘I usually don’t know’28) wã=pĩ-ʔɨm=na=ka
    1SG=HAB-be.afraid=DECL=ASS
    ‘I’m always afraid’        Perhaps related to what its semantics encodes, indicating that something
occurs in an extended period of time, the habitual prefix in Kakua also implies some
level of assumption by the speaker. For example, although its main semantics is that
of habituality, the speaker expresses a certain attitude towards the veracity of the
proposition when using the habitual prefix. In other words, because the habitual
prefix conveys that a given situation usually occurs in a certain predictable way, the
speaker is also encoding a degree of confidence towards the content of the
proposition, because she assumes that, given the habituality of the situation, it is
assumed to occur (or have occurred), as is being stated.
        Perhaps because of this, the habitual prefix does not co-occur with the
reported or the inferred category of evidentials, since its implication of assumption
would be incompatible with inferred or reported meanings. Inferred or reported
evidentialities do not imply that the proposition occurs as such ‘in the majority of
cases’ (Dahl 1985).1 An ‘assumed-like’ encoding, on the other hand, will imply that
the assumption is being made on the basis of a regularity, or ordinary occurrence of
a situation in such a way that it leads to assume or express the habituality of such a
situation. In other words, the habituality of the situation makes that situation
predictable.
        Note that the habitual prefix in Kakua does not necessarily encode that the
proposition must always be true, or that things always happens as is being stated. It
is an unasserted assumption that the stated preposition habitually occurs as such.
Perhaps this also explains why it is that the habitual prefix can cooccur with the
assertion (illocution) mood marker. Given that by using the assertion mood marker
the speaker full asserts the situation being expressed (see the description of the
semantics of the marker of assertion in Kakua in §10.5.3 below), the habitual marker
can be said to be also compatible with a ‘real’ world assertion (examples of the co-
occurrence of habitual and assertion markers can be seen in (27) and (28) above and
(29) below).
        The habitual prefix expresses propositions anchored to non-future tenses. The
explanation behind this can be that it would be rather difficult to predict that an event
        1
           Here I follow Dahl’s (1985:96f) definition of habitual aspect as a category of which the use
“indicates that what is expressed in the sentence took place in the majority of those occasions”.
         Note also that although the habitual marker, as presented here, includes some kind of evidential
meaning, it doesn’t strictly convey a default ‘assumption’. The habitual prefix encodes primarily
habituality, and it shouldn’t exclude or be incompatible with an evidential specification.

10.6 Evidentiality
10.6.0 Introduction
        In this section I present the complex evidentiality system of Kakua, which
differentiates between visual, non-visual, inferred, assumed and reported
evidentiality.
        In Kakua, the different evidentiality-marking morphemes serve to indicate a
number of ways in which the speaker relates to the proposition. Whether or not the
speaker is revealing a commitment to the veracity of the proposition is less relevant
than is expressing the source from which the speaker presents the proposition. In
other words, although it is true that evidential markers reveal “the extent to which
the speaker is committed to the truth of the proposition”, as in Bybee et al.’s
(1994:179) definition of epistemic modality, indicating the source of information (as
in Aikhenvald 2004:3 definition of evidentiality) seems to be the primary meaning
of Kakua’s evidentiality markers. Thus, I assume here that evidentiality in Kakua
serves to express information source, though it may also imply epistemic modality.
The latter is, however, not its primary function, given that evidentiality in Kakua can
also, but not exclusively so, encode the commitment of the speaker towards the
validity of the proposition. In this sense, the primary function of evidentiality in
Kakua is to provide information source, and only optionally it can also provide a
truth value of the proposition (epistemic modality).
        The different markers encoding evidentiality, and their semantics and
morphosyntactic hosts, are summarized in Table 10.5.

in that, like adverbs, it modifies verbs or entire clauses. Unlike adverbs, however, it
is more like a grammatical morpheme, and is here glossed as such. This is the
morpheme puʔba which encodes an emphatic meaning similar to the expression
‘right there’ or ‘right that’.
        An example of the emphatic adverbial like morpheme is given in (83)-(84)
below. This morpheme occurs always clause finally and it serves to emphasize the
entire noun phrase.83) měm           ma=tɨj-ni                  jew-háp=diʔ      puʔba

      ‘(he came) up until right there in the very middle of the front yard’         The main properties of adverbs in Kakua can be summarized as follows:a) Adverbs in Kakua are morphosyntactically different from verbs, in that they can
   occur on their own, without need of additional inflectional morphology.
b) Adverbs modify verbs and clauses, and encode meanings such as time, degree
   and certainty.
c) Unlike nouns, some adverbs do not take noun morphology such as case marking.
d) Syntactically, adverbs tend to occur at the beginning of clauses.

3.3.7 Particles
        Particles form a small but very heterogeneous classes of words. Particles are
a group of words that –like most adverbs, adjectives and nouns- can occur as
utterances on their own. Unlike adverbs and adjectives, these words do not function
as modifiers.
        Particles do not take any type of derivational or inflectional morphology.
They do not compound together with other elements. Particles are monomorphemic
words.
        Particles can be used as minimal expressions, responses, or reactions in a
discourse. This heterogeneous class of words includes discourse elements like the
hesitation particle nép ‘who was it now?’, or discourse tags like bat ‘dude’, hɨʔ̌ ‘and
what do you knowǃ’, expressions of astonishment like hiw              ̌ ‘no wayǃ’; and
interjections like ʔagá ‘ouch!’. A list of these particles is given in Table 3.12 below:Table 3.12 Particles in Kakua

               The noun: morphology and structure
4.0    Introduction
        This chapter describes the morphology of nouns and the syntactic position of
morphemes in the noun word.
        Most of Kakua nouns are formed by monosyllabic (at most bisyllabic) roots
(c.f., §2.3, Chapter 2, on the syllabic structure of morphemes in Kakua); morphemes
with three or more syllables are exceptional and in most cases are lexical borrowings.
        Kakua has a set of free and bound noun roots. A free noun root in Kakua can
be sufficient as a minimal nominal word; i.e., without need of additional morphology,
a bare noun root can function as head of a noun phrase, as an argument of a verb or
postposition, and also as a nominal modifier.
        Kakua nouns can be specified for number, shape, possession, case, and
definiteness.
        Nouns in Kakua do not take prefixes, and with the exception of proclitics, all
of the noun morphology in Kakua, as is the case for many Amazonian languages
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2012: 131), occurs exclusively after the stem. According to
Aikhenvald (2012:131), it seems to be a fairly common cross-linguistic tendency that
in predominantly suffixing languages, cross-referencing person-marking markers
will be the only morphology occurring in a pre-stem position. In the case of Kakua,
in which morphology is predominantly post-stem, the number of prefixes is very
limited (only two prefixing slots), and the cross-referencing person-marking markers
occur as proclitics.
        Semantically, the elements belonging to the word class of nouns in Kakua
denote animate and inanimate entities, including abstract concepts, substances,
names (like proper and place names), natural and ecological phenomena, among
others.
        This chapter is subdivided as follows: Section §4.1 introduces a description
of the two general types of nouns in Kakua: free and bound nouns. A template of the
noun in Kakua and its morphological categories, such as case, number, and
classification, is described in §4.2. This chapter ends with a description on the
different types of nominalization strategies in Kakua in section §4.3.","[144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149]"

                                                  Introduction: Kakua and its speakers                3        The morphology of Kakua is highly agglutinative (especially in its verbal
morphology), with a combination of head and dependent marking. The language is
predominantly suffixing, with a few prefixes occurring exclusively on the verb.
Kakua has cross-referencing proclitics that agree in person and number with the
Subject/Agent argument of the clause. Third person singular referents have,
additionally, gender agreement of feminine or masculine. Roots are often
compounded to form new words.
        Parts of speech in Kakua can be divided into open classes (nouns and verbs),
and closed classes (adjectives, adverbs, numerals, interjections, and other particles).
          Kakua nominal categories include number, classifiers, diminutive and
augmentative distinctions, and case marking. Nominalization is a highly productive
strategy to derive nouns from verbs. Animacy is particularly relevant for the system
of differential object marking and differential number marking. There are no
prefixing positions in the noun template, unless additional derivational processes
have been applied (Chapter 4).
          Nouns can be further subdivided into alienable and inalienable classes, as
is evident from the system of possession marking (Chapter 5).
        Most of Kakua morphology occurs in the verbal construction. There, prefixes,
suffixes and enclitics encode all of the tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality (TAME)
distinctions (clitics conveying TAME distinctions can also occur on other word
classes). Likewise, valency changing morphemes, verbal negation, cross-referencing
proclitics, and many markers of discourse also occur in the verb construction. Verb
roots can group together in a very productive grammatical strategy of verb
serialization.
        Kakua’s most common constituent order is verb-final (S)OV, although other
orders are also allowed. It has a nominative-accusative alignment system.","[24, 25]"

10.4.1 Declarative mood =na
        The declarative marker in Kakua expresses an assertion without indicating
the reasons for that assertion or the speaker’s commitment to it (as in the definition
of declaratives given in Palmer 2001:64). It is, in terms of Palmer (2001:64), an
“unqualified assertion”. This characterization of the semantics of the declarative
marker in Kakua also implies that a proposition marked with the declarative mood
can be further specified by modality in order to convey the speaker’s commitment
to it.
        In Kakua the declarative marker can co-occur with some evidential markers,
as long as they encode, by themselves, a certain degree of assertion. Such is the case
of the reported evidential clitic =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, in which the degree of assertion is
entirely a third party’s responsibility (see examples below).
        The declarative marker in Kakua is the clitic =na ‘DECL’, and although its
most common host is the predicate (verb; as in Table 10.4 above), the declarative
marker can also attach to other parts of speech such as nouns, pronouns,

    and.so=DECL             say=DECL=ASS                          PROG
    ‘so, (like this he) is saying’        As stated in the introduction to this section, the declarative marker is not
restricted to main clauses, as illustrated in the following example. Note that the
declarative marker occurs on the elements of the subordinated clause: 747) [ʔĩ=hǐt-feh-ni=na=diʔ                            ʔĩɁ=mup-ni=na=diʔ
    3PL=grind-leave-SUBR=DECL=OBJ                      3PL-to.rot-SUBR=DECL=OBJ     ʔĩʔ=babʔ-ni=na]                       niʔat                 ʔã=pĩ-ʔɨ ̃̂b-běd
     3PL=drink-SUBR=DECL            everything       3SG.M=HAB-take-finish
     ‘he would always take everything, that which they grinded and left, that which
     they rotted (manioc), that which they drink (beer)’        Assessments can refer to situations in the future or the past. Because of this,
the declarative marker can also co-occur with markers of tense distinctions. This is
illustrated in the following examples:
        6
           Note cases such as the one in (45), where the declarative enclitic occurs twice. Cases like this
are not explained in this grammar and future research is necessary to understand this phenomenon.
         7
            This is a very intriguing syntactic distribution of the declarative marker, occurring in
subordinate clauses even when not necessarily conveying reported speech. Perhaps an explanation for this
strange occurrence in subordinate clauses can be found in other semantic values that the declarative
marker can convey. For example, as implied above, the declarative marker can also convey some kind of
evidentiality value (i.e., that of an ‘unqualified assertion), as opposed to strictly functioning as a
declarative marker. In this sense, the declarative marker in Kakua would have properties of both illocution
and modality markers, blurring the line between these two type of mood markers.

    now=REAL 2PL=OBJ             3SG.F=take.out-INM.FUT=DECL=ASS
    ‘now she is going to record you’        A few examples above have illustrated the declarative occuring with the
marker of assertion =ka (e.g., (46), (48), and (50)), this serves to illustrate how
clauses with the illocution marker for declarative can be further specified for
modality.
        Likewise, the declarative marker can also occur in sentences marked with the
reported evidential. This is the only evidential category with which the declarative
can co-occur (be it marked by the reportative enclitic =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, or with the
second-hand evidential prefix t- ~ ti- ‘EVID’, as long as the sentence represents
reported information. Sentences of inferred evidentiality cannot contain the
declarative marker.8 See §10.6 below for a description of the different evidentiality
distinctions). The following examples illustrate the occurrence of the declarative in
reportative sentences:51) kět=diʔ           mi=t-nih=na=wɨt=hĩ,
    3PL=OBJ            3SG.F=EVID-say=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST      dě=beh=tigá                           ɲi=tʃãh

      3SG.F=EVID-say=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST
      ‘She asked them, where are you all going?’
         8
           I believe that one possible explanation for this is that perhaps the inferred evidentiality category
reduces somehow the degree of assertion of a situation. The situation is more likely to be asserted if the
speaker has either full commitment towards the veracity of it, or if the commitment towards the veracity
of the situation falls completely onto someone else. Thus, if the sentence is marked for reported
evidentiality, the responsibility of what is being asserted is not entirely on the speaker’s behalf, but on
somebody else’s. An inferred statement, on the other hand, implies the speaker’s own inferences as regards
the situation and may compromise her reputation if the situation is asserted based on inferred grounds.
This may also serve as another argument suggesting that the declarative marker has some kind of
evidential function.

    3PL=brother.in.law             arrive=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST
    ‘their brother in law arrived (it is said)’       The ability of the declarative marker to occur in reportative sentences is
predicted in Hengeveld (2004:1191), referring to quotations as one of the typical
environments in which a declarative marker can occur. 9 More discussion of
declarative clauses is found in Chapter 12.","[303, 304, 305, 306]"

10.4 Illocution
10.4.0 Introduction
        Illocution refers to a semantic subgroup of mood markers that function to
express the communicative intention with which the speaker presents a proposition.
As such, the communicative status of the proposition in Kakua can be that of an
assertion, a question, or a command. This section deals with these three basic
illocution markers, namely declarative (§10.4.1), interrogative (§10.4.2), and
imperative (§10.4.3).
        The markers of illocution are presented here only briefly in order to illustrate
their semantics. This is because these markers have a formal distinction as well as a
semantic one: they have the ability to form clause types (clause types are described       5
           A formal description of illocution marking is presented in Chapter 12 (clause types).
282   A Grammar of Kakuain Chapter 12, sections §12.9, §12.10, and §12.11 for declarative, interrogative, and
imperative clauses respectively. Negation is also described in Chapter 12).
       In the characterization of the morphological markers of illocution, Hengeveld
notes that “by their very nature, basic illocutions [this is declarative, interrogative
and imperative, KB] are restricted to independent sentences and quotations. This
feature will be of help in distinguishing illocutionary from modal categories”
(Hengeveld 2004:1191). This is, however, not a characteristic of the morphological
markers of illocution in Kakua, for these markers are not restricted to independent
clauses and may occur in subordinate clauses (see example (47) below, and Chapter
13, for examples of declarative marker occurring in subordinated clauses).
       The different markers of illocution mood in Kakua are summarized in Table
10.3 below.","[302, 303]"

       Acknowledgments
         After the many years it took me to sew this grammar together, I couldn’t
possibly come up with a fair list of all the people who helped me on my way.
Completing a dissertation is not only a writing process, but also an emotional ride
of happiness, excitement and despair.
         First, I owe the most heartfelt gratitude to the Kakua people, who allowed for
me to meet them back in 2008, and who later became a group of friends, a family,
taking care of me during the long walks in the inhospitable forest. With patience
they taught me the simplest, most beautiful appreciation for the sublime things and
beings in life. I thank those Kakua ‘who left’ to the forest and did not return, who
left life and kept on going, who passed away and are deeply missed. I especially
want to thank the women of Wacará for their power, for lovingly taking care of me,
and for showing me the formidable force of female wisdom. No acknowledgments
section is long enough, and no language is fair enough to express my gratitude for
the Kakua people.
         I greatly thank my supervisors who had to struggle along with my own
difficulties and periods of being stuck with a single problem, periods that seemed
like a string of eternities. At times I was filled with motivation, but at many others
it felt as if I was only being dragged through to barely make it to an end, or even a
starting, point. Some other times, I was delivering only because I couldn’t bare the
embarrassment of not keeping up with all of the support that seemed to have been
earned without fair merit from my end. I owe my gratitude to Frank Seifart who had
to face the worst effects of frustration, and who had made many sacrifices to walk
along with me and make this dissertation possible; I’m sure that I am still unaware
of many of his sacrifices. Kees Hengeveld always intervened with warm enthusiasm,
and he always offered emotional motivation that transcended beyond the dissertation
itself. Finally, I blame Pattie Epps more than anyone for both the beginning and the
end of this project. It was she who first encouraged me to undertake the
documentation and description of Kakua, and through the inspiration that she spreads
with her passion and endless motivation, even at the least promising times, I kept on
enjoying the ride of building the puzzle that the grammar of Kakua represents to me,
always positively affected by Pattie’s fascination for the project as if it was herself
going through every second of the time it took me to understand Kakua. Thank you
also for warmly taking care of me, personally and academically.
         At the University of Texas at Austin, where I spent my first years of academic
training in linguistics, I also splash some of the blame onto Nora England, who would
unconditionally offer me support, care and force, filling me with the confidence to
face the best parts and the nasty bits of these past years.
         Also at UT Austin, my professors and fellow students provided me with an
inspirational academic environment from which this grammar has greatly benefited.
         My friends Ana Paula Brandão, Telma Can, and Thiago Vital were the
familiar and loving support that only friends can offer when home is far away.
        The department of linguistics at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig stepped
in in 2012 to offer an unbeatable setting for academic development. I thank my
colleagues there for the academic inspiration towards a growth in the fascination for
science.
        My time in Leipzig was filled with colors and love from my friends Iren
Hartmann and Diana Schackow, reaffirming and redefining the meaning of
friendship and family beyond what I have ever experienced: Diana, motivated by
such caring love that she even suffered an uncomfortable train ride to come to my
rescue, and Iren, guiding me out of the darkest places with her strength, compassion
and love. Not only did both my friends provide me with important doses of much
needed alcohol and food, but also left a permanent impression of inspiration and of
strong loving women in academics, as well as friends and family. May life continue
to bring us together, and keep both of you as beautiful, strong and loving as the
women as you are.
        Also in Leipzig, Heriberto Avelino made sure of my emotional wellbeing,
and while he wasn’t exactly a model of decency (more of moral decay and chocolate
overdoses), I hold him deep in my heart for his friendship and love.
        In the world in general I have always run into Martin Kohlberger and always
will, and since I’m such a superstitious person I rapidly learnt that it meant he was
going to be that big part of my heart. I gave in and I couldn’t have had better times
and better laughs. Even during the most obscure times I would always be cheered by
the joy and love that he spreads. Thank you for helping me getting through the rough
unpaved parts of these past years. This grammar is silently infested with your
greatness.
        I thank Sasha Aikhenvald for the time in Cairns and the enthusiasm towards
the completion of this dissertation, and for her comments in some chapters of this
grammar. I also thank Kasia Wojtylak for every warm word and every smile.
        In Cairns I also had the emotional and pharmacological-caffeinated support
and friendship of Nick Piper, whose mere voice and presence was already a
motivation for happiness, not to mention our shared embarrassing TV preferences.
        Natacha Chevrier, for sharing the endless cold nights in Leiden, and always
offering an alternative in case of the apocalypse: ‘an incomplete grammar of Kakua’.
        I also thank the academic panel who revised this grammar for their insights
and stimulating comments.
        En Colombia, a mis amigos que me llenaban de fuerza silenciosa para seguir
trabajando. Saber que regresaba a verlos siempre era un aliciente para los días de
desespero y de ausencias. Federico Viadero, Daniel Castro, Mauricio Concha, Sharay
Cruz, Camilia Gómez Cotta, Madelaynne Montaño, Claudia Andrade, Pilar Blanco.
        Finalmente gracias a mi familia. A mis hermanos Soraya y Vladimir, por el
amor que es lo que hace hermosa la vida. A mis padres, de quienes lo recibí todo, y
que vivieron con fuerza las alegrías de esta aventura Kakua, y me ayudaron a llevar
el peso de las angustias y frustraciones. Solo ustedes saben lo que pasa más allá del
corazón y la mente, cuando la fuerza no es suficiente. Este trabajo es solo parte del
reflejo del inmenso amor, porque sin ese amor, confianza y cuidado, no podría haber
tomado el primer paso.

                    Introduction: Kakua and its speakers
1.0    Introduction
        Kakua is an Amazonian language spoken in the linguistic area of the Vaupés,
in Northwest Amazonia, eastern Colombia (the Ethnologue/ISO 639-3 code for
Kakua is cbv; the WALS code is cac).
        The language is a member of the small Kakua-Nɨkak language family.1 Its
speakers live in inland forest settlements. Two main settlements are home to most of
Kakua’s approximately 250 speakers. The largest of these two settlements is
Wacará2, with 183 individuals.3 Wacará is located between the Vaupés and the
Querarí Rivers in Colombian territory approximately 100 kilometers to the east of
Mitú, near the Brazilian border (see Map 1 below).
        The second bigger Kakua settlement is Nuevo Pueblo, which is an inland
forest village between the Vaupés and the Papurí rivers. The number of inhabitants
of this village is approximately 40 ~ 45 individuals.
        About 10-15 other speakers of Kakua live scattered either in villages inhabited
by speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages (a neighboring language family), or on
their own in remote interfluvial settlements.
        The present work undertakes a grammatical description of the Kakua
language. The description is based mainly on dialects spoken in the Kakua village
of Wacará. Kakua is divided into two main dialect areas (see §1.6 below), in each of
these areas, there are some clan-specific varieties.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"3.2.1 Nouns
       In Kakua, nouns are typically formed by a noun root which serves as the head
of the phrase (a detailed description of subclasses of nouns is given in Chapter 4).
       Semantically, prototypical Kakua nouns are lexical items denoting things,
places, names, animate and inanimate entities, abstract concepts such as thoughts and
104   A Grammar of Kakuafeelings, and various ecological elements. This semantic characterization of the noun
class complies with the typical typological characteristics of nouns (c.f. Givón 1979,
Hopper & Thompson 1984, Thompson 1988, Schachter & Shopen 2007, among
others). Examples of Kakua nouns are given in (19)-(20):19) nin tɨtʃi,     nin      Wacará
    this village this.M Wacará
    ‘In this village, here in Wacará’20) wěm          bík-wili=héʔ                       tul̂ iʔtɨ=diʔ         wã=tah-ap
    1SG           one-CL:fem=EMPH                      manioc=OBJ            1SG=plant-PST
    ‘I, alone, planted manioc’       Syntactically, nouns head noun phrases which can function as arguments of a
predicate; thus, nouns are typical hosts for the marking of case to indicate the
grammatical function of a head noun within a clause (see Chapter 6).
       Kakua is a predominantly verb-final language, thus, noun phrases tend to
precede the verb as illustrated in example in (21) below:                      Noun phrases                                           Verb
21) bɨ, nin    húptʃi=diʔ          wěm tul̂ iʔ-tɨ  wã=tah-ap=hĩ
    nowDEM year/summer=OBJ 1SG manioc-root 1SG=plant-PST=REM.PST
    ‘Now, in this year I have planted manioc indeed’       There is no exclusive phonological trait that distinguishes nouns from other
types of morphemes in Kakua.
       The morphology of nouns is far less complex than that of verbs.
Morphologically, and unlike verbs (see §3.2.2 below and Chapter 8 for the
description of the verb morphology and structure) 1, the vast majority of nouns roots
can occur on their own as free morphemes. Examples (22) and (23) below illustrate
nouns occurring as free morphemesː22) newě       ʔã=beh=na=ka
    man         3SG.M=go=DECL=ASS
    ‘the man goes away’23) ʔibǐ wɨbɨ              ʔã=tɨh-ɨ=na=ka       ʔã=ʧãhap
    uncle wild.turkey.hen 3SG.M=hunt-RED=DECL=ASS 3SG.M=PROG
    ‘uncle is hunting wild turkey hen’       1
           Verb roots occur on their own only under specific syntactic or discourse related conditions.
                                                 Types of morphemes and word classes                 105        Another morphological characteristic of nouns, as opposed to verbs, is that
the number of affixes that combine in individual noun forms are by far fewer than
those that combine with verbs. The maximum number of affixes that can be included
in a simple noun form is five derivational and/or inflectional suffixes. Additionally,
the Kakua noun template allows for only one proclitic, and a maximum of five
enclitics. Figure 2.1 below illustrates a simplified version of the noun template.
Obligatory elements are in bold (a detailed noun template is given in Chapter 4):Figure 3.1. Simplified noun template
       {PN=root(s)-suffix(es)=enclitics}       An example of a noun root and the morphology that attaches to it is given in
(24) below:24) miʔ=tʃɨ ̌jʔ-hɨd-bit-daʔ-na=héʔ
    3SG.F.POSS=manioc-circle-DIM-CL:round-PL=EMPH
    ‘her very own little manioc breads’       Nouns do not take prefixes. Prefixes are restricted to verbs. Unlike verbs,
nouns take affixes for number (25)-(26) and can be bound to shape classifiers (27):225) nɨ ̂w               nɨ ̂w-na
    leaf                leaf-PL.IN

    ‘louse’             ‘lice’27) wɨ ̂-naʔ
    leg-CL:tree
    ‘leg’       Nouns can also be the result of the nominalization of verbs. Example in (28)
below illustrates de nominalization of verbs by attaching the nominalizer suffix -at.
Other nominalization suffixes and nominalization strategies are described in Chapter
5.28) hěmɁ-at     wiʔi-kan
    eat-NMLZ     exist-NEG
    ‘there was no food’         2
             See chapter 4 for a description of nominalization of verbs when taking shape classifiers. See
chapter 5 for a description of classifiers in Kakua.
106   A Grammar of Kakua
       Only nouns can be possessed (alienable/inalienable possession. Possession is
described in Chapter 5). Example in (29) below illustrates possession on a
nominalized verb. Example (30) shows possession on a noun:29) fwit   fĩʔ=mɨ ̀n-at                                híʔhéʔ
     1PL 1PL.POSS=speak-NMLZ                            be.on.top
     ‘only in our language’30) nun-hějʔ-kan=hĩ                      wěm    kolombia-ǐʔ-haʔ=diʔ
    be.down.below-know-NEG=REM.PST 1SG             Colombia-POSS-mouth=OBJ
    ‘I did not know any Spanish’ (I didn’t know any Colombian mouth)       The strategy for negation in nouns differs from that of verbs in that verbal
negation is marked with the negation suffix -kan, while the negation of nouns is
expressed through existential negation,3 as in (31):31) kět webit wîʔi-kan          yegěʔ wîʔi-kan
    3PL child    not.exist-NEG    clothes not.exist-NEG
    ‘They don’t have children and don’t have clothes’       It is also an exclusive characteristic of nouns that they can be modified by
numerals, or take quantifiers. Additionally, numerals and quantifiers can themselves
function as head of noun phrases.
       Finally, noun compounding is a productive strategy in Kakua of derivation or
to express possessive relations. Noun compounding is described in Chapter 5.
       The following list summarizes the main properties of nouns in Kakua.
Properties summarized in (a)-(c) are exclusive to nouns; these properties also apply
to derived nouns, but the underived noun roots are most relevant for establishing the
difference between word classes. Properties summarized in (d) and (e) are properties
shared between nouns and verbs.a) Semantically: they refer to human beings, places, things, animate & inanimate
   entities, abstract notions
b) Syntactically: nouns function as heads of noun phrases. Noun phrases can
   function as arguments. Inflection for case occurs only on the noun phrase and
   on adjectives, and on verbs only when they are functioning a complements (see
   Chapter 13 on complement clauses).
c) Morphologicallyː there is a smaller repertoire of bound morphology that can
   combine with nouns than the repertoire of morphology that combines with verbs.
   The morphology of nouns includes the marking of number, shape and/or case.
   Nouns do not take prefixes.","[125, 126, 127, 128]"
"
9.3    Order of verb roots in a SVC
        A further interesting aspect regarding the serialization of verb roots concerns
the order in which the verb roots occur within the SVC. It is known from other
languages that the sequencing of verb roots in a SVC tends to be tense-iconic (c.f.,
Haspelmath 2014:13; Diessel 2008; Aikhenvald 2006:16, 21, 28-29; Durie 1997:§4;
Givón 1991). Likewise, the verb roots of a SVC in Kakua are ordered in such a way
that the verb expressing the earlier event of the sequence is placed at the beginning
of the SVC and is then followed by verb roots expressing later events, in
chronological order. Example (19) below illustrates this:19) ʔã=fwɨb-hɨ ̃wʔ-pàʔ-hɨ ̌j=na
    3SG.M=return-come-float-arrive=DECL
    ‘he came back, floated and arrived’     In example (20) the crying of the child is presented as preceding the arrival, and
therefore the verb root hɨj̃ ̌ ‘cry’ precedes the verb root hɨjbi ‘arrive here’ in the SVC.
This does not imply that the TAME values are different for the roots involved in the
SVC. The TAME values have scope over all of the roots in the construction.20) webit-wili                    ̃̌
                          mi=hɨj-hɨjbi=na=ka
    child-CL:fem          3SG.F=cry-arrive.here=DECL=ASS
    ‘the girl crying arrives here’       Many other functions and meanings of SVCs in Kakua remain to be further
explored in future research. In many other Vaupés languages, for example, in
addition to lexicalized SVCs and temporally iconic sequences of events, SVCs also
serve to express causative relations and simultaneous events. Furthermore,
Aikhenvald (2003, 2006:178-201) describes for Tariana (Arawak language spoken
in the Vaupés area) that certain orderings of the elements of a SVC appear to be non-
iconic with regard to temporality. Thus, the careful focus on SVCs in Kakua show a
promising, very fructiferous aspect of the language that should be further explored.
264    A Grammar of Kakua9.4    Serial verb constructions versus coordination of clauses
        Although many examples of SVCs are translated as coordinated constructions
in English (and Spanish as well), SVCs and coordination are clearly formally
different in Kakua. While SVCs present a string of verb roots having the same tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality values (TAME henceforth), and negation values marked
only once, coordination in Kakua is formed by the juxtaposition of verbs, where each
verb represents a coordinated event and is marked separately for TAME and negation
values.
        See examples (21)-(25) below on coordinated constructions, and compare
these to those shown for SVCs throughout the previous subsection. Note that each
coordinated event takes TAME or negation individually, even when the values are
the same for the entire construction. Example (21) shows a sequence of coordinated
events. Note that each predicate bears its own marking. Verb roots are given in
boldface:21) kǎn=na    ʔã=t-bɨ ̌g-jak                                           ̃̌ ʔ
                                                  ʔã=t-tʃâw-beʔ-ɲaʔa-hɨw
    there=DECL 3SG=EVID-fall-put.inside           3SG=EVID-smoke-grow-jump-come      ʔa=t-ʔǐg=na=wɨt=hĩ
      3SG=EVID-ignite=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST
      ‘(The firefly) fell inside (the firewood) and let out smoke and it lit the fire’        Similarly, consider the examples in (22)–(23) below, illustrating coordination
constructions, in which the SVC clauses are marked individually for TAME. Note
that although the subject argument is not indexed in both predicates of the two
coordinated SVCs in examples in (22) and (23) (because of discourse related criteria,
see Chapter 6), unless specified with different or same subject markers, the
coordinated predicates share the same argument:22) ʔɨdjɨ=bɨt
    younger.brother=also      ʔã=t-hɨjbi-ɲɨʔ-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ

               Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality10.0 Introduction
        Situating an event or state in time, both externally and internally (via
expression of tense and aspect, c.f., Comrie 1976, 1985; Dahl 1985; Bhat 1999;
Timberlake 2007), and expressing the different perspectives of the speaker toward
the event (via expression of mood, c.f. Bhat 1999; Hengeveld 2004; Timberlake
2007), is achieved in Kakua by verbal morphemes. Some of these can also occur
with other hosts, as will be indicated below for each of the morphemes.
        This chapter deals with the description of the semantics encoded in the
different morphemes that serve to express the speaker’s attitudes towards events or
states, and the general means to express location in time in Kakua. The meanings
involved are treated under the headings of tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality
(henceforth TAME).
        Tense distinctions are described in §10.1. The general characteristics of
aspectual distinctions in Kakua are described in §10.2. The categories of mood are
described in §10.3. Section §10.4 and §10.5 focus on the specific characteristics of
illocution and modality, respectively. Finally, evidentiality is dealt with in section
§10.6 of this chapter.","[284, 285, 286, 287, 288]"

Verb phrases in Kakua are preferably clause final. Examples (34) and (35) below
illustrate verbs in their most common clause-final syntactic position:34) kǎn          ʔã=beh=na=ka

illustrate the derivation of nouns from verb stems (nominalization of verbs, see
example (28) above). This derivation of nouns allows for verb roots to occur in other
non-verbal constructions. An additional example of nominalization of verb stems is
given in (39) below:39) mi=iʔ-wɨn-at

   processes, actions, or temporal or permanent states.
b) Syntactically, verbs can function as head of verb phrases that can themselves
   function as predicates.

                                           Types of morphemes and word classes        99selection. However, they are still being described as clitics here, because they occur
after a string of clitic positions of their host. Thus, describing them as affixes would
fail to account for the identity of the morphemes (clitics) which precede these set of
clitics which do not have freedom of host selection.
        The status of case markers as clitics vs. affixes will be discussed in some
detail here, as one example how clitics can be distinguished from affixes in Kakua.
Case markers have freedom of host selection in that they attach to nouns and
adjectives (which share some, but not all characteristics of nouns, see section 3.3.5).
On the other hand, case markers may only occur on verbs if these are in the
subordinate clause (see Chapter 12 for a description of subordinate clauses in
Kakua). Case markers also display a greater freedom of movement than affixes in
two further respects. Firstly, they can occur on only one element of the noun phrase,
rather than on each individual elements of the noun phrase (examples (4)-(8), which
can be the second (4)-(6) or the first element (7).4) mâw-bɨ ̂di-ip=wɨt=hĩ                      [nin-dê]=diʔ

100     A Grammar of Kakua      Secondly, =diɁ is attested to also occur after the remote past clitic =hĩ.
Normally, the remote past clitic occurs at the very end of a construction. These
examples are not common. I only have gathered a few. One such is:8) [wɨn-ni         báka=hĩ=diʔ]

      (long ago when the eclipse was passing) they asked the dead cadaver’ (Spanish
      ‘el cadaver finado’)        Affixes, unlike any other type of morpheme in Kakua (this includes clitics
and all of the word classes), can have syllables without onsets (see Table 3.3 below),
or consist of just a consonant (Table 3.4). Also, only affixes can have unspecified
vowels in their underlying structure. Thus, they allow for the copying of the vowel
quality of the host to which they attach. As mentioned above, affixes do not have
freedom of host selection. A list illustrating some representative examples of suffixes
in Kakua and their hosts is given in Table 3.3 below:Table 3.3 Examples of suffixes in Kakua

encoding second hand evidentiality in its reduced form t- (see Chapter 10 for
description of evidentiality), when preceding a consonant-initial stem (prefix-CVC),
violate the phonological restriction in Kakua that disallows consonant clusters. Note
that exceptions to phonological restrictions in Kakua occur for other affixes as well
(e.g. vowel copying and the onset-less syllables mentioned above). In what follows
of this section, I present a set of three enclitics that can attach to various word classes
to express emphasis or intensity of that constituent. These forms are: = jǔb, which
serves as an intensifier to nouns, with the semantic meaning of ‘truly’, or ‘really’.
Example (9) illustrates this verb root jǔb ‘be true’, from which this intensifier
derives, occurring within a verbal construction. Example (10) shows the function of
=jǔb as an intensifier of a pronoun:9) panʔni=tiʔ           nih-ip wɨd-jǔb=na=hĩ
    and.so=INTS         say-PST swallow-be.true =EMPH=DECL=REM.PST

    fire.wood burn-finish          3SG.M=OBJ=INTS                 burn
    ‘once the fire was on, (I) burned him really’        This intensifier has freedom of host selection, and it can as well occur with
another adverb, intensifying the meaning of the adverb to which it attaches. This is
illustrated in (11) below:11) fɨ ̂b-hɨ ̌j=nit=na               kǎn=diʔ           bɨká=jǔb

102   A Grammar of Kakua        In addition to the intensifier =jǔb ‘truly’ illustrated above, Kakua narratives
are full of the intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ. Its meaning is that of an affirmation
such as ‘truly’ or ‘exactly’. This intensifier =ti can also occur with both, nouns and
verbs:12) ʔã=t-hɨw̌ ʔ=hĩ=tiʔ          pɨ                   wẽp-ep=héʔ

     ‘the grandfather Sabino, in reality was my dad’       The intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ occurs commonly in interrogative clauses,
with interrogative pronouns and question words, and in adverbial particles such as
paniʔ=tiʔ ‘and so=INTS’, tɨt=tiʔ =ma ‘then’, and with the adverbial particle
hunhã=tiʔ ‘long.ago=INTS’.14) ʔĩ=ʔêw=na         hunhã=ti,           bêʔe=nit     hun=héʔ

3.2    Open classes
3.2.0 Introduction
        Nouns and verbs conform the two open classes of words in Kakua.
        The elements of the open word classes in Kakua have, in principle, an
unlimited membership. That is to say, the open classes of words in Kakua may
include not only native words, but also readily accept borrowings, calques, and any
other type of new lexical items such as words newly formed by semantic extensions
or by the lexicalization of formerly more complex words (e.g., historical compounds
that have undergone morphological and/or phonological fusion to form one complex
lexical item).
        The main element of the members of open classes is a noun or verb root that
heads the noun or verb phrase accordingly.
        Roots can be further divided into those that can occur as free elements and
those that are obligatorily bound with inflectional or derivational morphology
(Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the different free and obligatorily bound noun roots. Verb
are described in Chapters 8 and 9).
        In this study a free morpheme is understood as an element that is
phonologically independent, i.e. it is not obligatorily bound to another free
morpheme or to other bound morphology in order to form a full word.
        A major distinction between Kakua noun and verb roots concerns the
morphology each of these requires. Kakua nouns are formed by a free root that can
occur without the need of additional morphology. Verbs, on the other hand, require
for the most part a more complex morphology.
        The main semantic, phonological, syntactic and morphological characteristics
of Kakua nouns and verbs are described in the following subsections. Subsection
§3.2.1 describes these main characteristics that define Kakua nouns. §3.2.2 deals
with the main properties that characterize verbs.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"9.1     Serial verb constructions
       Serial verb constructions (henceforth SVCs) are constructions consisting of
two or more verb roots in sequence such that they represent one single clause. In
such a construction, there should be no other element (grammatical nor lexical) in
between the verb roots.
       Haspelmath (2014) has proposed a series of descriptive generalizations for
SVCs across languages. Loosely following these, I propose in the following list the
defining properties specific to SVCs in Kakua:i)         Components of a SVC in Kakua may not be negated separately .
ii)        Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same tense value and may not be
           given different tense values individually.
iii)       Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same aspectual value and may not
           be given different aspectual values individually.
iv)        Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same mood value and may not be
           given different mood values individually.
v)         Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same evidentiality value and may
           not be given different evidentiality values individually.
vi)        Components of a SVC in Kakua share the same arguments       I proceed now to provide examples in order to illustrate each of these

frustrative enclitic (position 10), and the declarative mood marker =na and the

interrogative =nit, adjectivizer –ni, agent nominalization –ni, and the collective
plural marker –nit.

    ‘perhaps they ate (it looks like it)’        The dubitative marker frequently co-occurs with evidentiality markers (most

the evidentiality system), and also with the frustrative marker (see example (41)

the clause contains the reported evidentiality marker =wɨt in slot 12). See example
(45) below and note that the frustrative enclitic occurs after the reported evidential

        Position 14: Enclitics: Tense and mood
        This position is filled by three enclitics that cannot co-occur with each other.
These enclitics indicate recent past =be ‘REC.PST’, remote past =hĩ ‘REM.PST’, and
assertion mood=ka.
        There are two forms of the assertion marker. The form=ka of the assertion
marker is used as the default. When the event being referred to is marked with the
assertion mood and takes place close to the speaker, the default form =ka is used.
When the event needs to be specified as taking place at some distance from the
speaker, the form =kɨ is used instead. This deictic distinction is made only by Kakua
speakers from Nuevo Pueblo belonging to clans descending from clans in Wacará.
The form =ka is not used by Kakua speakers of Nuevo Pueblo, and instead only the
form =kɨ is used with no deictic value.
        Example (47) illustrates a statement uttered while the speaker is distant from
the event being referred to (the event being that a person is approaching). The clitic
is glossed here as ‘ASS.DIST’ assertion distant). In (48), instead, the speaker refers to
the same event, but this time it is taking place close to the place where the speaker
is uttering the statement. The clitic is glossed here as ‘ASS.PROX’, assertion
proximate:

        The last slot of the verb word may be filled by enclitics encoding several
different meanings. These enclitics express additional information to the verb word:
the intensifier enclitic =bɨká (51); the enclitic =buh which provides modal
information about the clause, glossed here as an action done from far away, as in
example (52); and the different-subject enclitic, as illustrated in example in (53). The

254     A Grammar of Kakua
       In summary, it was shown that Kakua verbal morphology encodes a wide
variety of heterogeneous semantic distinctions. Many TAME specifications are
encoded by verbal affixes, while others are encoded in clitics that have freedom of
host selection, but also often occur on the predicate of the clause in Kakua (see Table
3.2 showing enclitics and their different hosts presented in Chapter 3).
       It is important to note that there are a few apparent counterexamples to the
morpheme ordering given in the template above. These concern the ordering of the
reportative evidential clitic =wɨt ‘REP’ and the directional clitic =buh. Both of these
markers have a clear lexical origin, as can be seen in the following examples:54) nǎwʔ-beh=na                   fwǐt      fĩʔ=mɨ ̀n-at                    hĩʔhẽʔ kǎn=diʔ

"8.1    Defining the verb in Kakua
       As opposed to the morphology of nouns (see Chapter 4), the verb morphology
in Kakua is very complex. With only very few exceptions, verb roots cannot occur
as bare roots when functioning as main clause predicates. Verb roots must always
be inflected for person, number (and gender for 3SG) with a procliticized cross-
referencing pronoun, and/or be specified for mood (see section §8.3 below).
236        A Grammar of Kakua       Phonologically, the characteristics of verb roots are not unique to the class of
verbs (see the description of the defining characteristics of the different parts of
speech in Chapter 3). Verb roots, as roots in the language as a whole, must be
minimally monosyllabic, and maximally bisyllabic. Roots bear lexical tone, and all
of Kakua’s tonal inventory is exhibited in verb roots (as shown in 1 below):1) jùj            ‘have diarrea’
    jûj           ‘massage while praying’
    jǔj           ‘be dripping’     Although a verb word may be composed of several roots (see Chapter 9 for verb
compounding and serialization), and these roots may present different tonal values,
the verb word as a whole has a characteristic intonation, with a high pitch at the
beginning of the word that gradually falls towards the end of the word. Thus, if a
verb word is composed of more than one root, the highest tone pitch for the second
root is invariably lower than the highest tone pitch of the first root (this is discussed
in detail in Chapter 2 on Kakua phonology regarding downdrift).
     Verb roots are also lexically specified for nasality or orality, as another general
characteristic of Kakua roots that is not unique to verb roots. As briefly introduced
in Chapter 2, verbs are distinguished from nouns primarily on semantic and
morphosyntactic grounds, rather than phonological (see the overview in Chapter 2
on the parts of speech and their basic characteristics).
        Semantically, verbs roots refer to actions (e.g., ʧaǩ̃ ‘bite’), processes (e.g.,
mǒp ‘to rot’), and temporal or permanent states (e.g., paʔ ‘be.like’; hěp ‘be.jealous’).
In other words, Kakua verbs prototypically express relations that are anchored in
time, processes or actions, or more general atemporal states of being such as dɨ ̀ ‘be
red’, nɨmʔ ‘be below’, etc. States denoting inherent or temporal properties are usually
expressed by descriptive verbs. The verb word may function as the predicate of the
clause.
        Related to its characteristic of being a heavily agglutinative language, Kakua
verb roots tend to encode only one relatively simple meaning each, while complex
meanings are created by combining various verb roots (see discussion in §8.3 below
for each of these verbal morphemes).
        Syntactically, the predicate tends to be the last constituent of the clause
(SOV). It is, thus, easy to recognize the verb word within a clause: it is the
morphologically most complex word, and the one that normally occurs in the last
syntactic position of the clause. The verb word by itself can also be sufficient both
as the predicate and as the only constituent of the clause, as is further discussed in
Chapter 11 on clause structure. Two examples are given in (2) and (3) below.
Example (2) illustrates the predicate occurring in its most typical final position.
Example (3) illustrates the predicate as sufficient to function as a clause in itself:

        This subsection describes the different semantic subclasses of verb roots. This
section will first address the semantics of verbs with regard to transitivity; after these
transitivity distinctions have been addressed, this section will describe the different
types of verbs with regard to other semantic features, specifically the semantic
subclasses of verbs, such as descriptive, stative, positional, and motion verbs. Other
verbal constructions and their semantics, such as verb serialization and
compounding, are dealt with in Chapter 9.
        With regard to transitivity, verb roots can be identified as being inherently
intransitive or transitive (mono- or ditransitive) verbs, judging by the number of
arguments that they can take. This distinction, however, is not very straightforward
and the lexical transitivity of verb roots is often difficult to establish. This is because
arguments do not have to be overtly expressed whenever these arguments have been
previously mentioned in the discourse. This applies particularly to the overt
expression of object arguments. Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb,
and only with restricted exceptions these are not overtly expressed. The rules
governing the optionality of cross-referencing subject proclitics are discussed in
Chapter 6.
        Example (4) below illustrates this problematic classification of verbs roots
according to their lexical valency. The example is extracted from a conversation in
Kakua, shows a semantically transitive verb bɨ ́dʔ-tû ‘add.onto-hold.vertically’, where
the object argument is not expressed. However, since the argument to which the verb
is referring had been previously stated, the sentence is perfectly grammatical in
Kakua discourse:4) bɨ ́dʔ-tû=ka=nit
   add.onto-hold.vertically=ASS=S.S      ʔã=t-hɨjbi-ɲɨʔ-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ
      3SG.M=EVID-arrive.here-stop-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
      ‘he arrived and stopped, and held (the panflute) vertically (against his body)’
238    A Grammar of Kakua       The use of another semantically transitive verb with and without an overt
object noun phrase is illustrated in (5)-(6).","[257, 258, 259, 260]"

13.1.3 Adversative coordination
       Adversative expressions encoding an emphatic meaning of opposition are
marked with the particle ʔubuʔhéʔti ‘but/although/on the other hand’. Its polysyllabic
form suggests that it is historically complex, but the etymology of this word remains
unclear.3 Some examples of the use of this adversative particle are given below:         3
             Hypothetically this form may be analyzed as follows: ʔu-buʔ=héʔ=ti ‘?-?=INTS=INTS’. The

     ‘I would’ve been having a party today if they had paid the work, but they didn’t
     pay’       In addition to the adversative particle ʔubuʔheʔtiʔ, Kakua also uses
juxtaposition to express adversative relations. Although this is more limited, and the
adversative coordinator connector ʔubuʔheʔtiʔ is preferred, a few instances of
juxtaposition with an emphatic adversative meaning are found within the corpus.
Example (13) below illustrates this adversative reading of the juxtaposed
construction. Note that in this construction the emphatic clitic =bǔ is used to encode
a contrast between the emphasized elements (see Chapter 3 for a discussion of the
emphatic semantics of =bǔ):13) kǎn=bǔ                     hɨ ̀dʔ-beʔ=na=wɨt=hĩ                                 kět=bǔ

     ‘(He) showed (the evil spirit), but they wouldn’t touch (it), they were afraid of
     him’
disjunctive o ‘or’, and the second one, buʔ, might correspond to the emphasis clitic =bǔ. Given the lack
of transparency of the form, no further hypothesis at this point can be drawn.

 the verb of the
 subordinate clause         As shown in Table 13.1 above, these five different subordinating strategies
are used to form three types of subordinate construction in Kakua. A canonical
description of subordination regards it as a particular type of combination of clauses,
such that one of them is syntactically and semantically dependent on the other (c.f.,
Langacker 1991, Cristofaro 2003). The subordinate clause functions as a constituent
of the higher clause. This presupposes a distinction between main clauses and
subordinate clauses. I follow here the general definitions of these three types of
subordinate constructions as defined in e.g. van Gijn et al (2011:3), Cristofaro
(2003), and Haumann (1997): complement clauses, which function as arguments of
the verb of the superordinate clause, are described in §13.5; relative clauses, which
function as modifiers of a noun phrase in the superordinate clause, are described in
§13.6, and adverbial clauses, which modify the verb of the higher clause or the higher
clause in its entirety, are described in §13.7.
       As shown above, subordinate clauses in Kakua can often be identified by
morphological cues (suffixes, clitics, particles, or even verb roots): i.e., there are
morphological elements that serve to identify the subordinate clause in a complex
clause construction (Table 13.1). These elements, as introduced in Table 13.1, have
                                                              Complex Clauses      351different syntactic positions with regard to the subordinate clause. They can be in
initial position of the subordinate clause (as with the temporal adverbial particle
tɨtimaʔ ‘then’), be cliticized to an element of the subordinate clause (as with switch
reference markers when used to link adverbial subordinate clauses, see §13.7 below),
suffixes (as with the subordinator suffix -ni, see §13.5 and §13.6 below), or as post-
or prepositions (as with the potential particle pînaʔ ‘POT’ see §13.7 below).
        As presented in Chapter 11, the preferred order of constituents in Kakua is
that in which the predicate of the clause is in final position (S)OV. Adjuncts and
subordinate clauses tend to occur embedded in the main clause (see, however,
examples of exceptions to this in §13.4 for tail-head linkage, and in §13.5 for
complement clauses). The internal structure of the embedded clause also tends to
maintain the preferred OV order. Thus, in an asymmetric combination of clauses
(subordination), there are going to be two predicates, one pertaining to the
subordinated clause, and another one pertaining to the superordinate clause. A
structure similar to the following is typical for an asymmetric combination of clauses
in Kakua, where the square brackets refer to the subordinate clause in the
construction: (S)[(S)OV]OV.
        The subordinate clause furthermore in the majority of cases precedes the
element that it modifies or is an argument of in the main clause. Thus, complement
clauses (§13.5) in the majority of cases precede the predicate of the main clause, as
follows: (S)[COMPLEMENT]V (see discussion of exceptions below). Likewise, relative
clauses (§13.6) tend to precede the N they modify, but relative clauses may also
follow their head. Example (14) illustrates a complement clause that precedes its
head, the predicate of the main clause.","[369, 370, 371, 372]"
"3.1    Overview of types of morphemes
3.1.0 Overview of the morphosyntactic characteristics of the types of morphemes
         This section summarizes the main characteristics of the different types of
morphemes in Kakua.
         Syntactically, morphemes in Kakua can be divided into two basic types of
morphemes: free morphemes and bound morphemes.
         Free morphemes are monomorphemic roots, which may represent nouns,
adjectives, adverbs, or particles. Verbs, on the other hand, cannot occur as free
morphemes (exceptions to this are discussed in Chapter 8 where a full description of
Kakua’s verbal morphology is given).
         Bound morphemes can be subdivided into three types: i) roots, ii) affixes, and
iii) clitics. Bound roots have lexical semantic content, whereas formatives (affixes
and clitics) tend to have a more abstract grammatical content. Some formatives,
nonetheless, have a clear lexical source from which a grammatical function has been
derived, and both the semantic meaning and the grammatical function can still be
identified.
         Most of the grammatical morphology in Kakua occurs after the stem. Thus,
the set of suffixes and enclitics is larger than the set of prefixes and proclitics.
         Affixes can be further subdivided into inflectional and derivational affixes.
Derivational affixes are optional whereas inflectional affixes are obligatory.
         A list of the different types of morphemes in Kakua is seen in Table 3.1
below:

                                                      morphemes       As opposed to the free morphemes and bound roots, affixes and clitics cannot
function as heads of phrases. Those morphemes that can function as head of phrases
are understood as words, whereas affixes and clitics form the set of formatives in
Kakua. The morphosyntactic characteristics of these formatives are described in
§3.1.2 below.
       The semantics and morphosyntax of the different word classes in Kakua are
described in §3.2 and §3.3 of this chapter.","[118, 119]"
"        For temporal adverbial clauses, Kakua also uses bare verb roots (see §13.4
above) (note that this is a different strategy than verb serialization. See Chapter 9).
In addition to the verb pêa ‘finish’, other verbs with similar semantics can be used
in this function, e.g., běd ‘extinguish’ or pê ‘be.last’ (these verbs are non-finite, used
in their bare form, i.e., without any additional morphology). Examples (42)-(44)
illustrate the use of such verbs as temporal linkers between the adverbial clause and
the main clause. Note that, like complement and relative clauses, the adverbial
subordinate clause precedes the main clause being modified. Note also that the verb
does not necessarily need to be a bare verb root in order to serve as an adverbial
clause linker (see also example (20) above, where these verbs appear to link two
main clauses, instead of marking a subordinate clause):       ̃́

sequencing of events is tɨtimaʔ ‘then’. In example (45) below the adverbial particle
links a nominalized subordinate clause (see below) to a main clause:45) wěm bɨ ̀ wã=tɨ ̀j-beʔ-bɨ ̌g
    1SG today 1SG=be.good-grow-fall    [kǎnʔ=tiʔ          mi=kûʔ-at                         tɨtimaʔ]

    today       1SG=be.good-grow-PST AT.LAST
    ‘Today I’m better, after she gave (me) her medicine, I am better finally’       Additionally, Kakua has a set of other adverbial particles (see Chapter 3,
section §3.3.6 on adverbs) that can serve as temporal adverbial linkers between a
main clause and a subordinate clause.46) panʔ       ʔã=nih-at            pũniʔ                     ̌ ʔ-hip

    ‘So, they gave me lots of their usual ants’        Purpose adverbial clauses can take the potential morpheme pînaɁ ‘POT’.
Unlike the other subordinate clauses, purpose adverbial subordinate clauses follow
the main clause. The potential morpheme pînaɁ ‘POT’ does not have any evident
etymological source. The fact, however, that it forms adverbial clauses that are
different from all other ones in that they follow the main clause, may suggest a
historic development of pînaɁ ‘POT’ that is different from other Kakua particles.48) ma=têw-buʔé=na               ʔĩ=t-nihi=wɨt=hĩ

    2SG.POSS=be.strong-NMLZ POT
    ‘learn how to work, they said [for your strength]’       Also in the absence of adverbial particles, the nominalization of the predicate
of the subordinate clause is used in Kakua as a type of adverbial subordination to
describe a result or a process together with its result. Note that nominalization is a
common strategy that South American languages use to create subordinate clauses
(van Gijn et al. 2011:3). In Kakua, nominalizations can function in the same way as
other subordinate clauses, where the adverbial subordinate clause precedes the main
clause being modified. The subject of the nominalized verb is also the subject of the
superordinate clause. Examples are given below:49) [jěw         ocho             hɨm-at=dê]                   ̌ ʔɨ=tʃaʔ

predicate construction with the verb root hîb. The use of this verb to express a causal
relation seems to be falling out of use, and only a few older people still use this verb
with a meaning such as ‘do as a consequence of’. Some speakers reported still
knowing and using this verb with such a meaning; however, they still attributed the
correct use of this verb to the older generation. Also, while in an elicitation session
with an elderly speaker, the young men accompanying the session would inquire
about the meaning of hîb when used by the older speaker. The following example
illustrates an instance where the verb hîb is used to express a causal relation:51) ʔã=t-ʔɨw              ʔã=t-hîb                           hiw      kǎn=diʔ

    3SG.M=EVID-eat=REP.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘Since he fell asleep, the jaguar ate him’       Younger speakers make use of some of the adverbial strategies in order to
construct causal relations, but more often by linking clauses via bare verb roots
(described in 13.4 above), resulting in constructions like the elicited example in (52)
below:52) ʔã=t-ʔɨw-ɨp=be                          ʔɨwɨ     hiw       kǎn=diʔ

    3SG.M=EVID-eat=REP.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘he fell asleep. Sleeping, the jaguar ate him’ (because he fell asleep, the jaguar
    ate him)
368 A Grammar of Kakua13.9 Summary
       Kakua has different mechanisms of expressing the relation between events:       i)        Verb serialization, which serves to express events that are
                 conceptually integrated into a bigger event (described in Chapter 9)
                 and which is not a combination of clauses,
       ii)       coordination, which serves to express a symmetrical relationship
                 among different independent clauses (described in §13.1 in the
                 present chapter),
       iii)      subordination, which expresses a dependent relationship among the
                 combined clauses (described from §13.2 onwards in the present
                 chapter).","[385, 386, 387, 388, 389]"
"
         23 Barnes (1999:210) observes that most of the East Tukanoan languages have no coda.
Moreover, in those languages said to have a coda, this is always a glottal stop, but the status of the glottal
stop has been analyzed differently by different authors. See Stenzel (2007) for discussion of the glottal in
Wanano.

             Types of morphemes and word classes
3.0    Introduction
        This chapter presents an overview of the major word classes in Kakua. These
are divided into open classes and closed classes of words. The defining grammatical
features of these word classes are established by syntactic, semantic, and
morphological criteria. The word classes in Kakua include nouns, verbs, a small set
of adjectives, a small group of adverbs, a group of particles, and a large number of
grammatical, bound morphemes.
        The intricateness of Kakua’s grammar is due, for the most part, to its
morphological complexity. Kakua morphology is highly affixing; most affixes are
post-stem (suffixes), as is characteristic of the languages spoken in the Vaupés
linguistic area (c.f., Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999, Payne 1990, Aikhenvald 2002b,
2012). Prefixing occurs in the verb phrase only and the number of prefixes in Kakua
is far less than that of suffixes (see Chapter 8). Compounding in Kakua occurs very
productively as a strategy of derivation, possession, or as a strategy to form new
(lexical) meanings.
        The verb morphology in Kakua is by far more complex than the morphology
of nouns, regarding both inflection and derivation (cf., Chapter 8). A detailed
discussion of inflection and word class-changing derivational processes related to a
specific part of speech can be found in later chapters where for each part a thorough
description is given.
        Kakua syntax, on the other hand, is more simple and straightforward. The
preferred order is SOV, although alternative orders are often allowed (see Chapter
12).
        The word in Kakua consists of roots (at least one is obligatory) plus other
optional elements such as prefixes, a large number of derivational and inflectional
suffixes, and other formatives, such as clitics. Some discourse-related morphemes,
namely particles serving as intensifiers, or adverbial particles, also cliticize to
preceding hosts. For an overview of the definition of the Kakua word see Section
§3.1 below.
        The first aim of the present chapter is to offer an overview of the main types
of morphemes of Kakua. Note that this chapter provides only a basic description of
the main concepts that help define Kakua’s parts of speech and different
morphological categories. Secondly, this chapter describes Kakua’s open and closed
word classes. Open and closed word classes in Kakua differ in that open word classes
admit new items, whereas the closed classes, on the other hand, strongly resist the
introduction of new items.
96    A Grammar of Kakua        An overview of the types of morphemes and a description of how affixes and
clitics can be differentiated in Kakua is given in section §3.1.
        The semantic, syntactic, and morphological characteristics of the open classes
of words in Kakua are presented in §3.2. Section §3.3 provides a description of the
semantic, syntactic and morphological characteristics of the closed classes of words.","[115, 116, 117, 118]"
"        The tense suffixes in Kakua are past –Vp, immediate future –min, and general
future –bip (see also Chapter 8 for verb morphology in Kakua and Chapter 10 on
tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality). These markers are always suffixed closest to
the verb root of the clause (see Chapter 8 for a full template of verb morphology). If
in a SVC, the tense suffix will attach to the last verb root in the construction.
Crucially, the scope of tense is over the entire set of serialized verbs. See examples
(7)–(8) below:7)    tʃèj-kɨjʔ-wã=diʔ                     ɲi=pɨ ̂wjak-hěmʔ-ep

      ‘you all put inside and ate the night ants’        1
            Note that the English translation given in (5) above might suggest that the verbs are negated
separately, and not as a SVC as a whole. The construction in Kakua, however, is conceived as a SVC
even though the translation in English fails to express this. Negating each of the verbs in the construction
separately would require the overt marking of the negation suffix -kan to occur on each of the verb stems
resulting in a combination of clauses (see §9.3 below for discussion of SVC and coordination):
        (i) wã=pĩ-hêjʔ-kan     wã=pĩ wêʔe-kan
            1SG=HAB-know-NEG 1SG=HAB-talk-NEG

          be given different aspectual values individually.","[280, 281]"
"
10.6.3 Second-hand evidentiality
        The categories of visual (unmarked) and nonvisual, described above, can be
described as firsthand evidential categories. Additionally, Kakua has two other
categories which indicate that the proposition was not directly experienced by the
speaker. These two categories of ‘second-hand’ evidence express inferences and
reported evidence. Each of these has specific morphemes, =ta (with its allomorph
=tagǎ) and =dê for inference (§10.6.4 below), and =wɨt for reported evidentiality
(§10.6.5 below). These two second-hand categories may co-occur with a prefix,
which indicates inferential evidentiality in general, without specifying whether or
not this inference is based on some else’s report or not, and which can be used on
its own. The co-occurrence of the second hand prefixes and reported or inferred
envidentiality clitics is not obligatory.
        This prefix has three allomorphs: t- ~ ti-, and t- ~ ta- and are all glossed as
‘EVID’. The forms t- ~ ti- co-occur with the reported evidential clitic =wɨt, and the
forms t- ~ ta- co-occur with the inferred evidential clitics =ta, =tagǎ. Both prefixing
forms ti- and ta- typically undergo a phonological reduction to t-. It is possible that
in a future stage of the language the difference between the two forms ti- and ta- will
be lost, and only the form t- will survive to encode second-hand evidentiality, where
further specification for inference or reportative will be required (as it is in
synchronic Kakua). Moreover, the difference between ti- and ta- is only rarely made
by elder speakers, and younger speakers only use the prefixed form t- for both
inference and reportative evidentiality. Thus, because of this possible future path
towards a neutralization of the prefixed forms into one single ‘second-hand’
evidentiality marker in need of further specification, I propose that these are
synchronically different markers, but will at some point merge together into one.
        Even for the elder generation that still makes the difference between ti- and
ta-, the difference seem to be made exclusively when a clitic of inference or
reportative is not present. In the remaining cases when the clitics for inference or
reportative are marked, then the prefixing forms ti- or ta- seem to be more rarely
marked fully as such, and are rather found as t-.
        A few examples are shown below. More examples of the co-occurrence of
the second-hand prefix with clitics of inference or reported evidentiality can be found
below in §10.6.4 and §10.6.5 respectively.

      ‘because he fell asleep, the jaguar ate him’ (reported information)        Prefixes in Kakua must be preceded by a proclitic (with the exception of the
reflexive/reciprocal prefix mik-, see Chapter 7). Thus, a second-hand evidential
prefix (and this applies also to the nonvisual evidential prefix described above) must
be preceded by a proclitic. If there is no person proclitic, the clause is only marked
with the relevant enclitic, as in (93) below:93) hêjʔ-kan=ta=be
    know-NEG=INF.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘(they) didn’t know’ (I infer)
10.6.4 Inferred evidentiality
        Encoding inferences in Kakua requires at least one morphological marker. As
described above, Kakua has a prefix form, t- or ta-, which expresses second-hand
evidentiality in general. Additionally, the encliticized forms of these evidentiality
markers further specify inference in a more narrow sense, and often co-occur with
the second-hand evidential prefix.
        The forms of these enclitics are: =ta ~ =tagǎ, and =dê. These forms always
encode inferred evidentiality, but they are used in combination with different tenses.
Unlike the forms =ta and =tagǎ, the form =dê does not co-occur with the second
hand prefix t- ~ ta- (described in §10.6.3 above). The clitic =dê encodes an inference
made regarding a situation at a future moment. It is glossed here as a future inferred
evidential ‘FUT.INF.EVID’. The inference expressed with =dê is based on tangible
evidence or evidence that can be corroborated that a certain situation is likely to
occur. Note in example (97) below that the enclitic for future inference = dê does
not necessarily need to co-occur with the future suffix -bip ‘FUT’. Therefore, the
future inference enclitic =dê could also be analyzed as expressing both evidentiality
and future tense.15         15
           It is possible that the form of this future inferred evidential has some relation to the basic form
(de-) of interrogative pronouns and questions words (e.g., dedě ‘what’, dêdʔ ‘which’, dêʔe ‘who’, see
Chapter 7, §7.2), although the semantic connection between interrogatives and inference remains unclear.

    ‘I’ll leave (tomorrow) (most possibly if it doesn’t rain)’95) wã=beh-min=dê=ka
    1SG=go-IMM.FUT=FUT.INF.EVID=ASS
    ‘I’ll leave (soon, most possibly, depending if circumstances are well)’       Using any other of the inferred evidential clitics in future tenses is not
admissible. The same construction in (96), for example, will not be possible to
express using the inferred evidential =tagǎ as illustrated by the inacceptable
sentence below:96) *wã=beh-min=tagǎ
    1SG=go-IMM.FUT=INF.EVID
    Intended meaning ‘I’ll leave (soon, most possibly)’       The future inferred evidential can attach to parts of speech other than verbs.
An example of the future inferred clitic attached to an interrogative pronoun is given
below:97) deděʔ=dê=tigá                        kãk=na=ka
    WHAT=FUT.INF.EVID=EMPH                 person=DECL=ASS
    ‘will it probably be a person indeed?’        For tenses other than the future, the basic form of the inferred evidential is
the clitic =ta. If the inference refers to a situation occurring in the remote past, then
=ta immediately precedes the remote past marker =hĩ, as in (98). If the situation
occurred in the recent past, then =ta immediately precedes the recent past clitic
=be, as in (99):98) mandú-wã              ʔĩ=t-hɨm-ɨp=ta=hĩ

    ‘after having gone, they ate’ (I infer from food leftovers)        Making inferences referring to a present situation, the form of the inferred
clitic is =tagǎ. It is possible that this form comes from a fusion of the inferred
evidential =ta (shown above), and the marker of assertion=ka, which by some

invariably =tagǎ (never =taka). Note that the marker of assertion=ka does not co-
occur with the inferred evidential marker =ta. To the question of where his father
was at the moment of speech, the speaker replied as follows:100) mâwa=tagǎ
     kill=INF.EVID
     ‘(he) is killing’ (I infer, that is why he is not here)        The use of the form =tagǎ is not restricted to situations in present time. A
good number of examples in the corpus involves the co-occurrence of the form
=tagǎ and the general past suffix -Vp. In these cases, however, the form =tagǎ
never occurs together with either the recent past or remote past clitics (if these tense
clitics were to occur, the form preceding them would always be =ta and never
=tagǎ). This is illustrated in the following example:101) nin-paʔ-ka                      ʔĩ=t-nih-ip=tagǎ

13.4 Bare verb roots as clause linkers: tail-head linkage       In addition to the switch reference markers presented in §13.3 above, Kakua
uses repetition of bare verb roots as a strategy to link clauses, in a system of ‘tail-
head linkage’9 (c.f., Hopper 1979, Stirling 1993, Thompson et al. 2007; also Givón
2001: 347). Tail-head linkage, as described previously for other languages, consists
of connecting (groups of) sentences or clauses by partially or completely repeating
the predicate of the last element of the linked clauses or sentences (the ‘tail’) at the
         7
             Note also that, as in the case of the different subject marker, the same subject marker in example
(15) and (23) above is cliticized onto an element of the main clause. Thus, this same subject marker should
not be described as a marker of subordination, rather, it can be more accurately described as a marker
that serves to combine clauses.
         8
             Note however that the repetition of the object argument is not a usual characteristic of tail-head
linkage strategies.
         9
              Other terms used are ‘linkage’, ‘head-tail linkage’, ‘recapitulative linkage’, ‘tail-head
recapitulation’ (c.f., Guillaume 2011:109 ff and other references there given). It is commonly found simply
with the abbreviation THL.
356 A Grammar of Kakuabeginning (the ‘head’) of the following sentence (c.f., Hopper 1979, Stirling 1993,
Guillaume 2011:110).10
          Kakua uses tail-head linkage as a way to temporally connect sentences or
clauses together, to recapitulate parts of the previous sentence or clause that sets the
(simultaneous) beginning of the following sentence or clause. When using a predicate
as a ‘linker’ (or connector of a chain of clauses or sentences), most of the verbal
morphology can omitted, but it is not obligatorily omitted. The only verbal
morphology that must be omitted with predicates when these are functioning as
linkers are cross-referencing proclitics. Suffixes and enclitics, on the other hand,
seem to be allowed in these connecting predicates. An example of the repetition of
a predicate as a linking strategy is given below (see also example (20) above). The
translation given to the connecting predicates is usually that of ‘while VERBing’, or
‘once VERBed’, or ‘after VERBing’. The connecting predicate is boldfaced:24) dettũp ʔã=t-jâj-ap=wɨt=hĩ         jâj=na                                      ɲâw-ɲàʔ-be

     3SG.M
     ‘he pulled a liana, (after) pulling he ran off’       An interesting characteristic of this repetition of the predicate as a linking
strategy in Kakua is that many examples show the repetition of the object argument
as well. Examples of this are given in (25)-(26) below:25) ʔã=ta-hɨjbi           ʔibi-bâdʔdaʔ                             hɨjbi

        10
             Some authors, e.g., Seifart (2010b) for Bora, include not only predicates, but also other linking
elements (such as pronouns) in the description of ‘tail-head linkage’ for specific languages.

there seem to be different tense values for the tail-head linking verbs. Note in the
following example that the ‘repeated’ verb is marked for remote past, while in the
preceding instance it is marked for recent past. Examples such as this also raise
questions regarding the exact way in which this strategy of repetition of predicates
relates to the canonical description of tail-head linking strategies.27) kět ʔĩ=t-ʔɨw-ɨp=ta=be                 ʔɨw-ɨp=hĩ

    ‘they slept, (after) sleeping, (they) made a house and slept’       De Vries (2005:376f), in a typological study of tail-head linkage in Papuan
languages, reports that in some of those languages, instead of repeating the last
predicate of the ‘tail’ clause, the tail-head linkage is formed by using a verb meaning
‘do’ or ‘be’ (translating into ‘having done that/so’ or ‘being so’). This type of linkage
strategy de Vries labels ‘generic verb linkage’.11 Similar to this, Kakua often uses
the verb pêa ‘finish’ as the linking ‘generic’ verb instead of repetition of the same
predicate in the ‘tail’ clause is used. This strategy in Kakua serves as a temporal
linkage of clauses, indicating the temporal sequence of the events. The translation
given in these constructions is ‘after finishing VERB’, referring to the completion of
the event expressed by the predicate of the ‘tail’ clause. See the following example:28) tâʔ-kit                           nin=diʔ         peŵʔ-jòʔbâ=ka

    ‘to this base of the blowgun hammer until it exits across, finishing, do well this
    one’
       11
            Also called ‘summary-head linkage’ in Thompson et al. (2007: 274ff).
358 A Grammar of Kakua         The verb pêa ‘finish’ can also occur together with a repeated predicate of the
‘tail’ clause, reinforcing the temporal sequencing of the linked clauses. The following
example illustrates this:29) bûd-hênaʔ=buh=nit mǐʔ=wãw-jùk     newěɁ Ɂãǰʔ=daʔ
    cut-count=DIR=S.S 3SG.F.POSS=head-hair man 3SG.M.POSS=CL:round    ʔĩ=t-tʃãh-ãp=wɨt=hĩ,                           tʃãh-pêa=nit    kǎnʔ=diʔ

    3PL=EVID-bath-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
    ‘(they) cut her hair like a man’s head they did, finishing doing, they bathed her’        The use of bare verb roots as a tail-head linkage strategy in Kakua serves to
maintain a temporal continuity of the events when there is a sequencing of clauses
in the discourse. As can be seen in the examples in this section, the sequence of
clauses may, but need not, be dependent on one another. As with the description for
switch reference markers presented in the preceding section (§13.3), tail-head
linkage in Kakua is more accurately described as a strategy of linking combined
clauses, rather than merely a subordination strategy, although it may serve to
introduce a subordinate clause.
        The tail-head linkage strategy presented here for Kakua behaves similarly to
those described for other South American, and particularly Amazonian, languages
(e.g., Guillaume 2008 for Cavineña, Zariquiey 2011 for Panoan Kakataibo; Michael
2009 for Zaporoan Iquitos; Overall 2016 for Chicham Aguaruna). It has been noted
before (c.f., Guillaume 2011:112f) that there may be a correlation in some languages
that have tail-head linkage strategies to also have a switch-reference system.
        The fascinating expression of tail-head linkage and switch-reference, and the
further unexplored functions or semantics that these might encode in Kakua, should
be further explored in future analysis and research to expand on the basic description
presented here. For example, it will be interesting to see whether the tail-head linkage
system or the switch reference markers can be analyzed as a type of cosubordination
(as defined by Van Valin & LaPolla 1997) in Kakua.","[376, 377, 378, 379]"

        5 This is a distinct group from the Bará people, speakers of an Eastern Tukanoan language of the
Vaupés, spoken in the Pirá-Paraná region. The etymology of this ethnonym is not clear
4     A Grammar of Kakua        The Kakua people have been locally referred to as Makú de Cubeo, Makú de
Desano, or Makú de Wanano, or generally as ‘Makú’. In the literature, they have
also been referenced as Bará (Silverwood-Cope, 1972) and as Cacua.
        The term ‘Makú’ has been used by the River people in the Vaupés region to
refer to any forest-dwelling group of people, or people from the forest in general,
regardless of their ethnicity or language (c.f., Jackson 1983:149, and other
discussions found in Ospina 2002 for Yuhup, and Epps 2008 for Hup. See also V.
Martins 2005 on reference to the ‘eastern Makú’ branch, and Mahecha et al. 1996-
97 on additional discussion of the term Makú. Epps & Bolaños submitted, offer also
discussion of the term Makú used as a linguistic classification to group many
unrelated forest-dweller peoples). The term Makú in itself has a very strong
pejorative connotation, and is even used as an insult among peoples in the region.
The term probably has an Arawak origin with the meaning of ‘those who do not talk’
or ‘do not speak’ (e.g. Arawak Baniwa-Curripaco ma-aku ‘NEG-speak’; see Koch-
Grünberg 1906:877; see also discussions in Martins & Martins 1999: 251, Ramirez
2001a:198, Epps & Bolaños submitted. See also Ospina 2002:16 for alternative
suggestions on the origin of the ‘Makú’ term).
        As opposed to the ‘forest people’, the ‘river people’ live along the main rivers
or main streams and cultivate large agricultural fields (compared to that of the
Makú’s). Their protein sources are obtained primarily from fishing, and this has
made them experienced river navigators able to face the wild rapids of the Vaupés
River.
        Forest people, in turn, are expert navigators of the land. They are perceived
as quick and silent in the forest and able to face long nights walking and sleeping in
the forest without being noticed by the river peoples. Their experience with water,
however, is less developed and constantly invites mockery from the river peoples.
        Forest people are both feared and looked down upon by River peoples.
Because they are considered to be socially inferior, they are hardly considered worth
referring to. However, because of their astuteness when dealing with the inhospitable
forest, the same river people who look at them with pity, fear them as well.
        Because the Kakua people have relied strongly on hunting and gathering for
their subsistence they are also called ‘Makú’ (as mentioned, the term ‘Makú’ is
applied to all the hunting-gathering forest peoples of the region). Different from most
of their neighbors, peoples from Eastern Tukanoan and Arawak speaking groups, the
Kakua peoples have a highly mobile lifestyle, engaging in long trekking, and hunting
trips that can last from one day to many months. Additionally, family groups often
organize trips to visit other family members either to the village of Nuevo Pueblo,
or to inland places where they spend time together, hunting and gathering forest
goods. These trips may last a few months, or even years.
        The connotations of the term ‘Makú’ is thus negative now and as far as we
know has always been so. In the broader social context of Colombia, being
indigenous is synonymous to being an inferior person, poor and naïve. Calling
someone an Indian in the urban context has very negative overtones. When
indigenous peoples in the Colombian Vaupés become aware of the social
embarrassment entailed in being indigenous, they claim not to be so, replying often
                                                   Introduction: Kakua and its speakers                5that the ‘Makú’ people are the real Indians, and not them (“indio yo? no, indios los
Makú, yo no!”).
        I have also witnessed a fight among children in an Eastern Tukanoan village
of Desanos, where the ultimate insult culminating the fight was when one of the
children involved called the other one ‘Makú’, reinforcing his insult saying “you are
just like those Kakua savages!”
        Likewise, in many of my trips to the area, whenever I have told people that I
frequently visit the Kakua people, I am questioned with high astonishment: why do
I want to visit forest people? and what is really so interesting about them? The
implication is as if they were almost animal-like creatures.
        When I first visited the Kakua village of Nuevo Pueblo, I was greeted by the
Kakua in the Desano language.6 When I replied back speaking in Kakua people
looked at me with disbelief and insisted a few more times in Desano. Once it was
clear to them that I could not understand a word of Desano, the first person
addressing me stepped back and with a look of unpleasant surprise on her face she
asked again, this time in Kakua, “are you really understanding our language? Can
you really not understand the language of the patrons?”. This seems to have been a
big disappointment not only for the Kakua people, but for the Desano people as well.
Many times during my stays in Nuevo Pueblo I was addressed in Desano, and people
seemed not to be able to get over the fact that I could not speak Desano but was
trying to make my way into Kakua.
        Finally, from my own observations in the Tukano village of Piracuara at the
basin of the Papurí River, the Hup people –also considered Makú, and with whom
the Kakua people of Nuevo Pueblo have social relationships and even some cases of
intermarriage– represent the more numerous population in the village. Nonetheless,
the Tukanoans maintain control and make primary decisions in this village. At the
local school, children are given meals twice daily during the school program. The
Hup children will only eat after the Tukanoan children have already eaten and been
served. This serves as a good illustration of the lower class position of the ‘Makú’
people vis à vis their regional neighbors.
        These experiences are not very different from what has been documented in
the ethnographic literature of the peoples of the area. For example, Jackson
(1983:159) mentions specific cases when the ‘Makú’ are referred to as animal-like
creatures.
        The ‘Makú’ people overall are considered to have a socially inferior status,
and their socio-economic relationship with the other indigenous groups of the area
(Eastern Tukanoans and Arawak groups) is clearly unbalanced.","[25, 26, 27]"

This reported enclitic has a clear etymological source in the Kakua verb wɨt
‘command’ (see comments on this at the end of Chapter 8). This clitic is also used
when quoting someone or in narratives such as mythological stories which are
regarded as events that did occur but were experienced by people who told them to
someone else. It is also used when the original source of the information is unknown,
or unavailable, but nevertheless the information is not regarded as imaginary.109) manji                  tɨ ̃̂b-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ

10.6.6 Getting the right evidential marker
        It is noteworthy that there is a strong awareness among Kakua speakers about
using the ‘correct’ evidential marking for each situation. The following episode that
occurred during my fieldwork illustrates how important evidential marking is in
Kakua speech. The following example comes from a conversation after watching a
documentary movie about the Nɨkak. Here the speaker is telling what he saw the
night before in the movie. Since this was a movie, choosing the correct evidential
marker is non-trivial, especially because the speaker himself had seen the Nɨkak
people before when they were brought to the Kakua village in the late 1980s. Thus,
he appears to have regarded the images in the movie as projections of situations in
the real world. However, a movie, or a photographic image, is not regarded as a
direct visual experience, but as information experienced through some other sensorial
means. The speaker hesitated on what evidential marker he should use, and, as seen
in the example below, he repeats the same predicate ( ʔĩ-t=jǎk-bâbʔ-bâbʔ=hĩ
3PL=EVID-cook-drink-drink=REM.PST ‘they cooked and drank’) various times until
he finally decides that expressing the proposition as visually experienced, without
any formal marking, is the most accurate way to tell his version of the story. The
text continued with the speaker only using the visual (unmarked) form.

                        Alignment and word order
11.0 Introduction
      This chapter describes word order in simple clauses (sec. 11.1) and the
alignment of argument NPs with respect to the predicate in simple clauses (sec.
§11.2-§11.5). Complex clauses and their syntactic behavior are presented in Chapter
13.","[322, 323, 324, 325, 326]"
"11.3 Subject alignment
       Subject arguments of intransitive verbs in Kakua are not treated distinctly
from those of transitive verbs. In other words, both A and S arguments behave in the
same way both morphologically and syntactically, exhibiting a prototypical
nominative-accusative type of morphosyntactic alignment: A=S≠P. Subject
arguments of a clause can be identified in two ways: they are NPs lacking
morphological marking for case (as opposed to other case-marked arguments), on
the one hand, and they trigger morphological agreement on the verb, on the other
hand. Compare the subject of the intransitive verb ʔêg ‘vomit’ in (11) with the subject
of the transitive verb hěmʔ ‘eat’ in (12) below. Note that in both cases the subject
argument is expressed by the pronoun kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ and it is indexed on the predicate
with the proclitic mi= ‘3SG.F’; the lack of morphological case marking and the
syntactic position of the subject noun phrase and the indexing on the verb seen in
the intransitive construction in (11) are the same as those in the transitive
construction in (12):11) kǎnʔ        mi=ʔêg=na=ka
    3SG.F        3SG.F=vomit=DECL=ASS
    ‘she is vomiting’12) kǎnʔ          tʃɨ ̌jʔ-daʔ,              niʔat=jǔb,
    3SG.F          manioc.bread-CL:round, everything=INTS,      mi=hěmʔ-ep=be
      3SG.F=eat-PST=REC.PST
      ‘she ate the manioc bread, everything reallyǃ’       As mentioned above, a clause in Kakua can be formed by a subject and a
predicate, or by a predicate with a subject proclitic (in addition to no expression of
subject at all, if recoverable from the context). Consider the following intransitive
clauses. In (13) the subject argument is fully expressed with a free pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’ as well as indexed on the verb with the cross-referencing proclitic ã=
‘3SG.M’, which agrees in person, number and gender with the subject NP kǎn.
                                                   Alignment and word order        309Compare this to the construction in (14), where the clause is formed by a single
predicate with the proclitic wã= ‘1SG’, indexing the subject argument of this
intransitive clause:13) kǎn        ʔã=ʔêw=na=ka
    3SG.M       3SG.M=sing=DECL=ASS
    ‘he is singing’14) wã=pĩ-ʔɨm=na=ka
    1SG=HAB-be.afraid=DECL=ASS
    ‘I’m always afraid’        Subject arguments can express the semantic roles of agents or experiencers.
Examples (15) and (16) show subject arguments of stative verbs in which the subject
arguments have the semantic role of ‘patient’, a prototypical semantic role of subjects
of stative verbs:15) wěm         wã=pĩ-hêjʔ-weʔe-kan=be
    1SG          1SG=HABT-know-NEG=REC.PST
    ‘I used to know’16) wěm        bɨ          wã=tʃù-fwɨʔɨ
    1sg         today       1SG=rest-TEL.PROG
    ‘I am, today, still resting’       Subjects of intransitive verbs of motion or active verbs prototypically have
the semantic role of agent. This is illustrated in example (17) below:17) kǎn       ʔã=t-fwɨ ̂b-ʔǎb-beh=na
    3SG.M      3SG.M=EVID-follow-go.up-go=DECL
    ‘he went back up again’       Finally, subjects of intransitive clauses involving verbs of mental or emotional
processes (or verbs of perception) prototypically have the semantic role of
experiencers. Examples (18)-(20) below give an illustration of these types of clauses
in Kakua:18) kǎnʔ        mi=pĩ-tîk=na=ka
    3SG.F        3SG.F=HAB-be.embarrassed=DECL=ASS
    ‘she is usually embarrassed’19) wěm        bɨdǐ           ̃̂

    ‘I was very sad/very sorry’

    ‘they might be surprised tomorrow’       Examples (12)-(20) above illustrate the expression of subject arguments in
intransitive clauses, showing that, although the subject noun phrase does not receive
morphological marking to indicate its grammatical function (i.e. no subject case
marker), the verb usually takes a cross-referencing proclitic encoding person and
number properties of the subject argument.
       The expression of subject arguments in transitive clauses is illustrated in
examples (21)-(22), which show that the subject arguments are morphologically and
syntactically expressed in the same way as the subject arguments in the intransitive
clauses presented in (11)-(20) above. In (21) the subject argument expressed by the
NP wã=ʔibi ‘my uncle’ is the instigator of the action expressed by the transitive
verb tɨh ‘kill with blowgun’ performed on an object argument with the semantic role
of patient, which is morphologically marked with the object case marker =diʔ:21) wã=ʔibi  wɨbɨ=diʔ           ʔã=t-tɨh=na=tagǎ

      PROG
      ‘my uncle must be hunting Curassow (bird.sp)’        Example (22) shows a similar type of clause, where the subject argument is
expressed both by the NP hiw ‘jaguar’, and indexed on the predicate with the
proclitic ‘3SG.M’, agreeing in person, number and gender with the subject argument:22) hiw       mɨhiw=diʔ               ʔã=t-tʃãk=na=wɨt=be
    jaguar dog=OBJ                    3SG.M=EVID-bite=DECL=REP.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘the jaguar bit the dog, it is said’        The syntactic position of subject arguments in intransitive and transitive
clauses is preferably sentence-initial (see above). Additional examples are given in
(23)-(24), displaying constructions involving verbs of perception or mental
processes. In (23) the subject is a lexical noun cross-referenced on the verb by the
proclitic ʔã= ‘3SG.M’. In (24) the subject argument is a pronoun and is also cross-
referenced on the verb:         S      O                           V

    ‘he loved his daughter’        Consider now example (25), in which the subject argument is not expressed
through an NP, but indexed on the predicate of the clause only. In this case the
resulting constituent order is O s=V. Example (26) further illustrates the same order,
where the noun wãp ‘white capuchin’ is the object of the verb fwãʔ ‘find’, and the
subject is expressed by the proclitic fwĩ= ‘1PL’:        O                                   s=V

    ‘we met the (evil spirit) white capuchin’
11.4 Object alignment
       Kakua marks its object arguments with the case marker enclitic =diʔ on the
object NP, i.e. a dependent-marking strategy, in terms of Nichols (1986). Unlike
subject arguments, object arguments are not indexed on the verb. Examples (27)-
(28) below illustrate object case marking:27) měm=be                       wěm=diʔ             ma=buʔé=na=be
    2SG=REC.PST                   1SG= OBJ             2SG=teach=DECL=REC.PST
    ‘you taught me’28) wěm         kǎn=diʔ                   wã=hěp-ʧàʔ-tɨb=na=ka
    1SG          3SG.M= OBJ                 1SG=be.jealous-be.on.top-hurt=DECL=ASS
    ‘I am jealous of him’       The object case marker clitic =diʔ serves to mark object arguments in several
different semantic roles.1 This is examplified in (29)-(32). (See further discussion on
semantic roles and object marking in Chapter 6). Example (29) shows an object
        1
            See the comment in Chapter 6 regarding the possibility that the object marker =diɁ might have
other functions than marking object arguments, as it also occurs on noun phrases expressing source/goal,
as well as on other NPs that are not core arguments.

more objects co-occur in di-transitive constructions, both in terms of the use of the
object case marker =diʔ and the differential object marking that applies to it.
       An example of a ditransitive construction is given in (33) below. This example
exhibits a typical ditransitive Kakua verb wɨʔ̃ ̌ ‘give’, exhibiting an agent-like subject
argument, and two objects, one of which is in a recipient (R) role, Gabí ‘Gabriel’,
and the other, dâwa-daʔ ‘ball-CL:round’ is in a theme (T) role. Two things are
important to note here. Firstly, note that all object arguments are marked with the
object case marker =diʔ. Secondly, note that all arguments occur before the verb:

"7.1    Personal pronouns
       The Kakua pronominal system has three different sets of forms: free forms,
bound pronouns (that serve to express possessive relations as described in §5.3, or
to encode cross-reference to the subject argument as described in Chapter 8), and
possessive pronouns (occurring in alienable possession, described in §5.3). Table 7.1
summarizes the forms and functions of the three sets of pronouns in Kakua.

        As can be seen in Table 7.1, Kakua pronouns encode person and number.
Gender is specified only for the 3 rd person singular forms. The 3rd person singular
pronoun kǎn ‘3SG.M’ is obviously related to the proximate demonstrative form kan
‘PROX.DEM’. The 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn ‘3SG.M’, can in principle be used
for inanimate referents (‘this/it’), and animate male (or unspecified for gender)
referents (‘he’) (it is a non-feminine form, see below) and is glossed in the texts as
‘3SG.M’. For inanimate 3rd person singular referents, the demonstrative form kan is
used most often. Therefore, kan is glossed as either ‘PROX.DEM’ or ‘3SG.M’ according
to the context. If encoding deixis is its main function, then it is glossed as
‘PROX.DEM’, whereas if in pronominal function it refers to an inanimate referent, it
is glossed as ‘3SG.M’. Section §7.3 below describes the forms and functions of
demonstratives in Kakua.
        Gender distinctions in the forms for 3rd singular pronouns are best understood
as feminine versus non-feminine.1 The forms kǎnʔ and mi= strictly encode female
gender for 3rd person singular, while for all other referents, the pronouns kǎn
‘3SG.M’ and ʔã= ‘3SG.M’ are used even when the gender of the referent is not strictly
male, or is unspecified. All of the pronominal forms shown in Table 7.1 above, can
be further specified by feminine gender. This is done by attaching the feminine suffix
classifier -wili:2)      wěm-wili
        1SG-CL:fem
        ‘I (female)’

    For the sake of consistency, kǎn, ʔã= and ʔãǰʔ=, are glossed as ‘3SG.M’ throughout this work, even
when the referent is not male.

     ‘he was the one who chased away the jaguars’ (he was the jaguar chaser)       The bound pronouns (proclitics) are normally bound to a head noun or verb.
When bound to verbs, the proclitics serve as cross-references to the subject argument
of the clause (see Chapter 6 on argument marking in Kakua).
       The set of pronouns that are called “bound pronouns” can also occur without
being attached to a head noun or verb, but in this case the bound pronoun must
always be followed by another clitic to form a phonological word. The contexts
motivating the constructions of the pronouns without a head noun or verb need to be
explored in future research.
       An example of the proclitic occurring with additional morphology only,
lacking a head noun or verb, is illustrated in (5) below:5)   fwɨb=be               mâ-naʔ          kan      ʔã=be           wɨw
     return=REC.PST        tree-CL:tree     3SG.M    3SG.M=REC.PST caiman     wã=beʔên=tâ=tik                     ʔã=be            wɨw
     1SG=recognize=INF.EVID=INTS          3SG.M=REC.PST caiman
     ‘I came back, (with) a stick I recognized the caiman, he must have been a
     caiman!’        Unlike the free pronouns, the forms of the bound pronouns do not have lexical
tone specification; instead, their tone value is assigned by the elements in the
surrounding environment to which the proclitics are attached (usually the tonal value
is assigned by the roots to which the pronoun is clitized). In cases such as the one
presented in (5) above, where the bound pronoun lacks a head, and instead it occurs
only with other morphology, which are themselves also toneless, the entire set of
bound morphemes is realized with a low tone.
        When pronominal forms function as subjects, objects, or comitative or
locative adjuncts they take case markers indicating their function within the clause:
214     A Grammar of Kakua6)    kǎnʔ       kan=diʔ            mi=t-hěmʔ-ep=wɨt=be
      3SG.F         3SG.M=OBJ        3SG.F=EVID-eat-PST=REP.EVID=REC.PST
      ‘She ate it’ (it is said)       As described in Chapter 5, (bound) pronouns can be used to indicate
possessive relationships. Inalienably possessed nouns take bound pronouns, while
alienably and inherently possessed nouns take the possessive (bound) pronouns (see
Chapter 5, §5.3, for description of possession). As mentioned in Chapter 5 (§5.3),
the possessive pronominal forms in Kakua are derived from a combination of the
bound forms of the pronouns with the possessor marker –íʔ. This is shown in Table
7.1 above in the column of possessive pronouns. An example of an alienably
possessed noun marked with the possessive bound pronoun is given in example (7)
below:7) ʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ                   kǎn     kãk=bɨt
   3SG.M.POSS=path=LOC               3SG.M    person=ALSO     ʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ
     3SG.M.POSS=path=LOC
     ‘[they parted…], he (the armadillo) on his way, and the person also on his way’        Free pronominal forms do not have variants when used as possessive forms.
        Kakua pronouns can have anaphoric functions, referring back to a previously
mentioned noun or noun phrase, as discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 (§11.2 on
subject alignment).
          In Kakua narratives, usually a (3SG.M) pronoun is sufficient to refer to the
main participant of the story, and the expression of the participant as a lexical noun
is not necessary. Example (8) below illustrates a situation in which two participants
of the narrated event are being referred to by using 3SG.M pronouns only:8)    kǎn        kǎn=diʔ           ʔã=t-těw-hip=tagǎ
      3SG.M        3SG.M=OBJ         3SG.M=EVID-shot.darts-DUB=INF.EVID
      ‘he (the person) shot darts to him (the jaguar)’       Like the demonstrative form kan (see above), the third person pronoun can
also be used for generic reference to inanimate entities in general, or abstract
concepts like thoughts, feelings, or ideas. The bound pronoun highlighted in bold in
example (9), anaphorically refers to the derived noun higaɁ-at     ̃̂      be.sad-NMLZ
‘sadness’. It can also be translated into ‘it (the sadness)’. Example (10) illustrates an
instance of the pronoun kǎn used for generic anaphoric reference.

7.2     Interrogative pronouns and question words
       The interrogative pronouns in Kakua are built from the element de-, to which
other morphological material is added. The interrogative pronominal forms are given
in Table 7.2 below:Table 7.2 Interrogative Pronouns
  Gloss                                    Form

  who                                      dêʔe       These pronouns can be used as arguments of clauses, as shown in the
following examples:11) dêʔe=ti=be                    mem=diʔ          ʔã=t-ʔên

    who=INTS talk-A.NMLZ          POT      say=DECL=ASS 1SG=PROG
    ‘I’m saying, who is going to talk?’       An interrogative mood marker =nit may optionally be cliticized to the verb
of the clause, as found in (14)-(16) below.14) dedě=tigá          kǎn     pant   nih=nit

    ‘what do you want?’16) dêdʔ=ti            ma=nâʔ=nit
    which=INTS          2SG=want=INTERR
    ‘which (one) do you want?’       Interrogative pronouns, as is the case for the rest of the pronominal forms in
Kakua, do not have different forms when functioning as subject, object, comitative,
locative, etc. Thus, if functioning as an object argument, for example, the
interrogative pronoun does not change its basic form and instead it optionally takes
the object case marker, compare examples (15) and (16) with (17) and (18) below:17) dêʔe=diʔ=ti=be                 ma=ʔên
    who=OBJ=INTS=REC.PST            2SG=see

    what=OBJ=INTS 2SG           know
    ‘what (story) do you know?’        Interrogative pronouns can take the possessive suffix -íʔ to encode possessive
relations, as in (19), or be compounded to a noun stem as in (20) below. Note that
in cases such as that illustrated in example (20) below, the interrogative pronoun is
not considered a procliticized form (as with the proclitic personal pronouns) because,
unlike proclitic personal pronouns (possessive personal pronouns), the interrogative
pronoun can stand on its own, like other interrogative words (i.e., can occur
syntactically unbound, like example (23) below where the interrogative dě ‘where’
occurs on its own. Most commonly, however, the interrogative pronouns occur
together with intensifiers or emphasis markers):19) dêʔe-íʔ  tigǎ     nin-mɨ ̃̌-hǐw
    who-POSS EMPH this.M-house-jaguar
    ‘whose dog is this one right here?’            ̃̌

    who-son=OBJ=INTS=REC.PST                 2SG=see
    ‘whose son did you see?’        Kakua has a set of forms that are homophonous to the element de- present in
the interrogative forms: the inferred future evidentiality enclitic =dê ‘INF.FUT.EVID’;
and the noun dê ‘relative’ (‘person who is related). The extent to which these forms
may or may not be related is unknown.

that are also built from the element de-. These question words are given in Table 7.3
below:Table 7.3 Question words

Note that in example (22) the particle paʔniʔ ‘and so’ presumably functions as a
clause linker, with the interrogative pronoun initiating a new clause.21) děd=paʔ           fǐt    fĩ=fwîʔ=hĩ

      ‘they stayed there for, hmmm… how many?, another month?’       As seen in this section, Kakua interrogative pronouns and question words are
built on a basic de- form. Semantically, both interrogative pronouns and question
words can be considered to fall into one class of interrogative words. Functionally,
however, these words form two different sets: the set of interrogative words that
have pronominal function, and the set of interrogative words with adverbial
functions.
                                                  Elements of the noun phrase         2197.3    Demonstratives
        Kakua has a demonstrative system which makes three distinctions: proximate,
distal, and immediate proximate. The forms of demonstratives are given in Table 7.4
below:Table 7.4 Kakua demonstrative pronouns
 Function                                            Form Demonstrative Pronoun Proximate ‘there/this’
                                                             kan                                                             kun ~ kǔn ~ nun
 Distal ‘that’
                          masculine ‘this right              nin
 Immediate                here’
 proximate                feminine ‘this right               ninʔ
                          here’        The proximate and distal demonstrative forms, kan and kun respectively, can
be specified for gender if necessary (unlike immediate proximate forms, which are
already inflected for feminine gender in their basic form). In such cases, the classifier
-wili may be suffixed to the demonstrative form as follows: kan-wili ‘this (female)’,
and kun-wili ‘that (female)’.
        Additionally, the 3rd person singular feminine personal pronoun, kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’,
can be used as a demonstrative when referring to female animate beings that are
(spatially) proximate to the speaker, and in such cases it is preferred over kan-wili.
        As mentioned in §7.1 above regarding the 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’, both kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kan ‘PROX.DEM’ can be used with the same deictic
meaning. It is also possible that the proximate demonstrative form kan was the
historical source of the pronominal forms kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ (following a
crosslinguistically common development of 3 rd person pronouns from
demonstrative), but the pronominal forms include further phonological
specifications, which suggests that a reverse development might also be possible.
        The proximate demonstrative kan ‘PROX.DEM’ is used to refer to objects
which are spatially close to speaker, to the hearer or to both. It is not used for objects
immediately next to the speaker, for which the immediate proximate demonstrative,
nin or ninʔ, is used. The proximate demonstrative is also used to refer to something
that has already been mentioned in the discourse, e.g. ‘the one there’, or ‘this
aforementioned’ object. The proximate demonstrative can be translated as English
‘this’ or ‘there’, and is glossed as such where appropriate:27) kan=jǔb=pûʔba
    there=EMPHZ:be.true=EMPH
    ‘right there, all right!’

    ‘he lived over there also’        The distal demonstrative kun ‘DIST.DEM’ is used to refer to referents far away
from the speaker, hearer, or both (32). Its alternate forms are kǔn and nun. The use
of the distal demonstrative is usually accompanied by a pointing gesture signaling
towards the (imagined, in the case of stories, for example) location of the referred
entity. The referent can be either visible or not visible to speaker and hearer. This
distal demonstrative has an alternate form nun as shown in Table 7.4 above. The
criteria conditioning the use of one over the other seem to correspond to clan dialectal
variation but need to be investigated further.","[233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"
"3.2.2 Verbs
       Verbs form the second open word class in Kakua. In general, the verb part of
speech is formed by lexical items that function as heads of verb phrases.
Semantically, in accordance with the typologically expected semantics of verbs (see
Schachter & Shopen 2007: 9-13), Kakua verbs express actions (e.g., ʧǎk ‘bite’),
processes (e.g., mǒp ‘to rot’), and temporal or permanent states (e.g., paʔ ‘be.like’;
hěp ‘be.jealous’). In other words, Kakua verbs prototypically express relations that
are anchored in time, processes or actions, or more general atemporal states of being
such as dɨ ̀ ‘be red’, nɨmʔ ‘be below’, etc. States denoting inherent or temporal
properties are usually expressed by descriptive verbs (see Chapter 8 for a detailed
description of verbs).
       The semantic concepts expressed by verbs differ considerably from those
expressed by nouns. Based on semantics itself, verbs and nouns can be identified as
two different parts of speech. Morphological and syntactic properties of verbs are
addressed below in this section.
       Unlike nouns, verb roots in general cannot appear as free forms, i.e. cannot
be uninflected. With the exception of some specific contexts in which verb roots can
appear as free forms, verbs always require minimally a mood suffix (the exceptional
contexts in which verb roots can appear as free forms are discussed in detail in
Chapters 8 and 9).
       All of the tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality distictions are encoded in
verbal morphology, but note that some of the enclitcs encoding tense, aspect, mood
and evidentiality can also occur on other parts of speech.
       A verb root must always be specified by mood (enclitic), and when the
specific semantic and discourse related criteria are meet, the proclitics must always
precede the verb root. Verb roots occurring as free elements have a very restricted
range of contexts, one of them being citation forms (example 26, further below). In
general, verbs in Kakua consist of at least one root plus an obligatory mood (e.g.,
declarative) clitic. A detailed description of verb morphology and structure is given
in Chapter 8.
       In addition to the obligatory morphology, verbs generally take proclitics that
agree with the subject argument of the clause. For this reason, an intransitive verb
marked with a person and number proclitic and a mood enclitic can serve as a
complete sentence on its own:

    ‘I am leaving’        A simplified verbal template is given in figure 3.2 below. Obligatory elements
are in bold.","[129, 130]"
"4.1    Free and bound nouns
       Kakua nouns can be divided into two types of nouns; nouns that are
obligatorily bound (i.e., noun stems that cannot occur without additional
morphology), and nouns that can occur freely (i.e., without need of any further
morphology).
128       A Grammar of Kakua        Bound noun stems are almost all obligatorily possessed. These include, but
are not restricted to, nouns with human referents, like kinship terms, but also nouns
denoting body parts, parts of a bigger entity, hunting and personal instruments. Also
included in this group of obligatorily bound noun stems are a large number of nouns
referring to inanimate entities which must be specified by a shape classifier suffix.
The nature of these nouns is further described in Chapter 5 (on compounding,
classification, and possession of nouns in Kakua), which also includes a discussion
on the status of classifiers. Bound nouns thus require a possessive pro-form
preceding the obligatorily bound noun (see Chapter 5 for a description of possession
in Kakua, obligatoriness and the alienable/inalienable distinctions).
        Kinship terms in Kakua, for example, are obligatorily possessed.
Furthermore, they are possessed via a strategy of inalienable possession in which
they take a proclitic pronoun, and not possessive pronouns (see Section §7.1 in
Chapter 7 for a description of pronominal forms in Kakua):1)    a. wã=ip           b.       Ɂĩ=hî             c.      mi=nɨm

include proper names, nouns referring to animals, vocative forms of kinship terms,
elements referring to parts of the natural environment (e.g., dirt, star, sun, dawn),
and some objects that do not need to be specified by shape classifiers.3)    a. bɨ ̌bʔ           b.       ʔîm                c.      Ɂetá

       Nominal morphology in Kakua is by far less complex than verbal
morphology. Kakua nouns never take prefixes. With the exception of proclitics
(including possessive proclitics which obligatorily precede bound nouns), the
morphology of nouns in Kakua is exclusively post-stem, and this includes suffixes
and enclitics.
       Free noun roots can stand on their own as the only obligatory element to form
a noun word in Kakua, unlike verbs (see §3.1.1 and Chapter 8 for verb morphology).
Free nouns roots can also function as arguments of a predicate or as an attributive
modifier of another noun.
       Of all of Kakua’s word classes, only nouns can be specified for possession.
Nominal negation is expressed through existential negation constructions (see
Chapter 12, §12.7 for a description on existential negation constructions).

root (in boldface) is obligatory in forming a noun word in Kakua, except in the case
of bound nouns (see §4.1). While free nouns will not require more than a noun root,
obligatorily bound nouns require additional nominal morphology, these being
proclitics, or classifiers. Some nouns can have more than one root (see §5.1 in
Chapter 5 on noun compounding and classifiers). The noun word (as a grammatical
word) ends at position 5. Nouns (as phonological words) may include clitics
(positions 6-10).","[149, 150, 151]"

Chapter 5). The coordinated juxtaposed NPs are boldfaced:7) tʃênewã=wɨt=hĩ                        ʔã=ʔwěbʔheɲě

13.1.2 Disjunctive coordination
       Coordinated clauses expressing disjunction have two possible realizations.
They can be marked with the morpheme o (a loan from the disjunctive conjunction
o in Spanish),2 or by simple juxtaposition (asyndetic coordination). The use of
morpheme o as a marker of disjunction seems to be used more frequently among
younger speakers of Kakua. The simple juxtaposition strategy as a form of
disjunction is a more frequent strategy, especially among elder speakers.
         Example (8) below comes from a conversation with one of the eldest Kakua
men. He does not use an overt marking for the disjunctive construction. The
interpretation as a disjunction is given by context. A conjunctive reading (‘and’) is
also possible, but in the example below, the speaker interpreted from the context that
the reading of the sentence should be that of disjunction:8) wîʔi-kan               měm             hêjʔ-kan=na=ka                  kět

     know-NEG=DECL=ASS
     ‘no, you don’t know, or they don’t know (the story)’        Example (9) shows the disjunction of NPs, also without a connector, although
the interpretation is that of a disjunctive construction:
        2
            The use of o as a disjunctive connector is found in many other languages of the Vaupés, which
might suggest that its use in Kakua came from contact with perhaps Tukanoan languages (although it
must ultimately have a Spanish source). However, its predominant use by younger speakers in Kakua,
might also suggest that it was borrowed directly from Spanish.

     ‘What is it that makes that noise? is it his teeth or his fingernails?’       Although no example of the disjunction of clauses using the Spanish loan o
occurs in the currently transcribed Kakua data, I report here the use of o for the
disjunctive coordination of clauses from the speech of younger Kakuas that I
overheard. Disjunction with the Spanish loan o is more frequent in conversations,
and less so in narratives. Perhaps this has to do with the speakers’ perception of
narratives as a speech event usually used with stronger authority among the elder
generation, who tend to use the juxtaposition strategy rather than the use of the
disjunctive coordinator o from Spanish.
       Mithun (1988:332) suggests that languages that lack a writing system (or
lacked it until recently) often lack indigenous coordinators and use coordinators
borrowed from prestige languages such as Spanish, English, Arabic, and Russian
instead.","[367, 368, 369]"

7.5    Quantifiers
      In addition to numerals, Kakua has other morphemes that express quantity.
These are: tâwʔ ‘sometimes’, tak ‘be.middle/half’, niʔat ‘all/every’, lâ ‘times/era’,
dawǎ ‘many’, and henaʔ ‘this much/count/measure’. These terms can act like
modifiers of nouns (or adverbials) in noun phrases, or can also occur by themselves
as the head of a noun phrase functioning as quantifiers. Examples of these
morphemes expressing quantity are given below:44) panʔniʔ=na                  bɨ ̃̀   tâwʔ          wɨnɨ=tʃaʔ

large quantity or a group of entities:

7.6    The emphasis marker =bǔ
       The Kakua enclitic =bǔ is a polysemous morpheme. It serves as a locative
case marker (encoding physical and temporal location), as illustrated again in
examples (54) and (55) below (see section §6.4.1 in Chapter 6 for a description of
locative case marking):54) ʔIna         wâptʃiʔ=bǔ               mi=beh-bip=na=ka

    ‘let’s go fish downriver’       In addition to the locative use, the enclitic =bǔ also serves to emphasize a
particular participant in an event. A contrast between the locative use of this marker
and its emphatic use can be seen by comparing (54) and (55) above to the example
in (56) below.56) nih=na   beh=nit                          panʔ       ʔã=t-nih-ip=hĩ

      ‘this is the one that says, goes like this, grandfather said’      When functioning as a marker of emphasis, =bǔ can attach to subject

historically derive from one morpheme; i.e. =bǔ underwent, or is undergoing, a
semantic extension, and also developed different distributions: one occurs with
subjects whereas the other (locative) cannot. The direction of this semantic extension
(or semantic shift) would probably have been from physical location which became
associated, over time, with the ‘location’ of a participant within the discourse,
following the cross-linguistically the common pathway from a concrete spatial
meaning to other more abstract meanings (e.g., of time or discourse relevance).
        Whichever the direction might be, the semantic extension, or shift, of =bǔ
developed with a functional motivation, in which either a physical location became

more abstract-like discourse marking of participant location became associated to
the physical location of a referent.
       This enclitic is glossed as ‘LOC’ when functioning to mark location, and as
‘EMPH’ when its use is to emphaticize a participant of the discourse. Further
examples of the emphatic use follow.58) panʔ=na                 kǎn     jǔ=bǔ

8.0    Introduction
        The morphology of verbs in Kakua is complex. Verbal morphology is highly
agglutinative (“concatenative” in Bickel’s 2007 terms), i.e. several functional
morphemes and roots concatenate to form the verbal word.
        While most Kakua clitics and affixes occur after the stem, verbs have the only
prefixing positions in Kakua, but even in verbs, suffixes and enclitics far outnumber
prefixes and proclitics. These prefixes encode some of the evidentiality categories
fused with aspectual distinctions (see Chapter 11), and the reflexive/reciprocal
morpheme mik- ‘RFLX/REC’.
        Verbs in Kakua inflect for person and number, and gender for 3SG, encoded
in the cross-referencing proclitics which mark agreement with subject arguments. In
principle, these proclitics are obligatory on the verb word; some semantic and
discourse conditions, however, allow for omission of these proclitics on the verb.
These criteria were discussed in Chapter 6.
        Verb stems are morphologically regular, there are almost no suppletive forms
or other types of allomorphy, with one exception, the irregular verbal stem form niʔ,
which is considered to be the past form of nih ‘say’.
        This chapter presents a detailed description of the morphology and the
structure of verbs in Kakua. Some semantic characteristics are also discussed, but
the details of semantics of the verb in Kakua await future research.
        Section §8.1 describes the phonological, morphological and semantic
characteristics of verbs in Kakua. Section §8.2 is dedicated to the different semantic
classes of verb roots, i.e. the semantic distinctions of positional, stative, motion, and
descriptive verbs. The basic morphological template of verbs and the structure of the
predicate is discussed in §8.3. Further verbal constructions, like compounding,
serialization, and other tense, aspect, mood, modality and evidentiality distinctions
are discussed in subsequent chapters.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"

10.5.3 Assertion mood =ka ~ =kɨ
        The clitic =ka expresses assertion by the speaker. By using this clitic, the
speaker expresses her attitude towards the situation, in a sense that it is the speaker
herself who takes responsibility for stating the situation.
        This enclitic of assertion has two forms =ka and =kɨ. Kakua speakers of
Nuevo Pueblo use the form =kɨ exclusively. Kakua speakers of Wacará, on the other
hand, use both =ka and =kɨ. The form=ka is used as the general assertion marker.
The form =kɨ appears to have a deictic meaning as well, indicating a spatial distance
between the speaker and the hearer. Thus, the difference between the example from
a text in (74) and the elicited example in (75) is that in (74) the speaker is in close
spatial proximity to the hearer, while in (75) the speaker is presumably speaking
from a distant point. The deictic distinction is not commonly marked, and because
of this I describe the form =ka as the ‘default’ form of the assertion marker.74) wěm=ka kǎn=diʔ                wã=mâw-bip

292     A Grammar of Kakua       The enclitic of assertion can attach to various parts of speech, such as
pronouns (74) above, demonstratives (76), nominalized or adjectivized verbs (77),
NPs (78)-(79), and predicates (as in (80)-(82), which represent the most common
hosts of the assertion marker).76) nin=bǔ=ka                                 ʔã=hépaʔ-bip=na=ka

    ‘I don’t remember’        The marker of assertion, as seen in example (76) above, can occur in
situations anchored in a future tense. In these cases, the assertion marker is
acceptable if the future situation is likely to take place, given that the assertion
marker encodes a situation to which the speaker is committed.
        The assertion marker can also co-occur in situations that are further specified
for evidentiality, specifically with the reported evidential marker (§10.6.6). In
                                         Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality      293principle, the assertion marker does not occur with the past and present forms of the
inferred evidentiality marker (see §10.6.5 below), this might have to do with the fact
that inferring that a situation has occurred (inferred evidentiality), doesn’t represent
the confidence needed for the speaker to commit an assertion towards the situation.
An alternative analysis for the assertion marker possibly having fused with the
inferred evidential marker is presented §10.6.5 below (although an inference in the
future tense can be marked with the assertion marker).","[312, 313, 314]"

13.5 Complement clauses        A complement clause is commonly defined as a clause that functions as a core
argument of the predicate of the main clause (c.f., Givón 2001:39, Dixon 2006:15-
40, Noonan 1985:46, 2007: 52). Predicates that can take a complement clause,
instead of an NP, as their argument, are commonly verbs that encode meanings of,
e.g., say, believe, wish, know, see, hear, tell (Noonan 2007). These type of predicates
                                                              Complex Clauses      359are commonly called ‘complement-taking predicates’ or ‘CTPs’ (e.g. by Noonan
2007:53).
        In Kakua, common CTPs are verbs like nih ‘say’, nǎwɁ ‘tell’, and hêjɁnahǔj
‘think/believe’ (from hêjɁ ‘know’ and hǔj ‘listen/understand’). Complement clauses
in Kakua do not take special subordinating morphology (i.e., a complementizer
particle). Syntactically, complement clauses are most typically embedded within the
main clause:30) fǐt [Iginio tew-bǔpʧew-ni=na=ka]                         fĩ=niɁ
    1PL Iginio work-have.flu-ADJVZ=DECL=ASS                    1PL=not.know    hêjɁnahǔj-kan=be
    think-NEG=REC.PST
    ‘we didn’t think [that Iginio was sick]’ (with dengue)       Although the complement clause tends to be embedded within the main
clause, alternative orders can also be found. Consider example (31), referring to a
child who is in her crawling stage, perhaps about to walk. In (31) the complement
clause occurs following the main clause. The alternative order in (32) is also accepted
by speakers.31) kǎnɁ mi=nih-hêjɁnahǔj=na
    3SG.F 3SG.F=say-think=DECL    [ʧejbit                mi=japʧi-hej-bip=na=ka]
    tomorrow               3SG.F=walk-know-FUT=DECL=ASS
    ‘she says that she thinks [that she will know how to walk tomorrow]’32) [ʧejbit  mi=japʧi-hej-bip=na=ka]                           kǎnɁ
    tomorrow 3SG.F=walk-know-FUT=DECL=ASS                      3SG.F    mi=nih-hêjɁnahǔj=na
    3SG.F=say-think=DECL
    ‘she says that she thinks [that she will know how to walk tomorrow]’       Example (33) below also shows a case in which the complement clause
follows the main clause:33) wã=hêjɁ-kan=ka              [dedpaɁ=ka          Ɂĩ=ʧãh-ãp=tagǎ]
    1SG=know-NEG=ASS              WHAT=ASS            3PL=do-PST=INF.EVID
    ‘I don’t know [what they did]’      Alternatively, the example shown above can also be analyzed as a
combination of two main clauses (e.g., ‘I don’t know, what did they do?’).
360 A Grammar of Kakua      The conditions allowing for these alternate orders have not yet been explored
and await future research.
13.6 Relative Clauses        Relative clauses are clauses that modify an NP of the main clause (c.f.,
Keenan 1985, Van Valin 2005:183-224). In Kakua, relative clauses differ from
complement clauses in that they are marked with the relativizer suffix –ni/-nit12 (here
glossed as SUBR ‘subordinator’) that attaches to the predicate of the relative clause.
The relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. 13 When the relative clause is
modifying the object argument of the main clause, the object marker may also occur
on the relative clause (e.g. (35) below). The relativized noun phrase can be the
subject, or object (as in (35)-(36) below) within the relative clause. There is no
relative pronoun in Kakua, and as the examples below show, the subordinator suffix
marks the predicate of the relative clause:34) [fin               têw-ni]              newě     Ɂã=wɨn-at
    yesterday          work-SUBR             man       3SG.M=die-NMLZ     Ɂã=beh-ep=be
     3SG.M=go-PST=REC.PST
     ‘the man [who worked yesterday] died’ (the man who worked yesterday went
     to his death)35) [ʧɨ ̂=diɁ                     hěmɁ-ni]=diɁ        ɲɨj=diɁ
    pineapple=OBJ                 eat-SUBR=OBJ         opossum=OBJ     Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be
     3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
     ‘they killed the opossum [that ate the pineapple]’        12
             Note the (near) homophony of this morpheme with other functional morphemes in Kakua: the
interrogative clitic =nit ‘INTERR’ (Chapter 8), agent nominalizer suffix -ni ‘A.NMLZ’ (Chapter 4),
collective plural -nit ‘PL’ (Chapter 4), and same subject clitic =nit ‘S.S’ (Chapter 8 and section §13.3
above). The homophony of morphemes in Kakua has been seen also for other morphemes (e.g., declarative
=na, inanimate plural number -na; emphatic =bǔ and locative =bǔ). The extent to which all of the
-ni/=nit forms might have a historic relation hasn’t been explored yet. Finally, the variants -ni ~ -nit as
complementizer suffixes seem to have free variation even within one and the same speaker. Since I did
not test for a context in which one form would be preferred over the other, a more systematic study should
be undertaken in future research on Kakua.
        13
             According to Dryer (2013), relative clauses preceding the noun are rather uncommon outside
of Asia. He also points out that typologically languages in which the relative clause precedes the noun are
also verb-final languages, which is true for Kakua.
                                                               Complex Clauses      36136) [mɨhiw ɲɨn-ni]=diɁ            mɨɁ=diɁ         Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be

    3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
    ‘they killed [the opossum to whom Katherine had given pineapple]’        Examples (35)-(37) above raise various interesting questions. One concerns
the marking of object case on both the relative clause and the head noun. Probably
this marking on both elements is a formal distinction that, in addition to the use of
the subordinator marker -ni ~ -nit, helps to identify relatives clauses from other types
of subordinate clauses. Or maybe the marking of object case on both the relative
clause and the head noun can be interpreted as an apposition of a headless relative
clause and the noun to which it refers (headless relative + head N. See examples of
headless relative clauses below).
        Another interesting construction of relative clauses is that shown in example
(37). This is an internally headed relative clause, which illustrates yet another
strategy of relative clause formation. Kakua can thus be said to have externally
headed relative clauses, internally headed relative clauses, headless relative clauses,
and (maybe) the apposition of the relative clause and the head noun.
        Future research on these different subordinating constructions will
undoubtedly provide us with very enriching typological information of subordination
strategies in the languages of the area.
        Kakua frequently uses headless relative clauses. Thus, the subordinate clause
occurs on its own and, as other relative clauses, usually precedes the predicate of the
main clause. Examples of headless relative clauses are given below. Note that
perhaps because of the lack of a head NP, in this type of headless relative clauses,
the subordinate clause seems to also be able to function as an argument of the main
clause (to function as a complement clause). Headless relative clauses are, by
definition, arguments of the main clause; thus, finding a formal difference between
headless relative and complement clauses can help to set these constructions apart in
Kakua. Possibly, a formal difference is the presence of the subordinator particle -ni
~ -nit ‘SUBR’. This formal distinction will help to describe examples like the ones in
(39)-(41) below, but does not account for the headless relative in (38) which lacks
the subordinator suffix. A rigorous evaluation of the different types of subordinate
clauses and their strict formal distinctions awaits further research:

have not provided a description of arguments that may or may not be relativized

other within the relative clause).

        The dubitative modality expresses doubt as a subjective approximation of the
situation on the part of the speaker. The speaker indicates that she has a certain
degree of doubt regarding the veracity of the proposition. This semantics of the
dubitative marker in Kakua conforms to the typical characterization of what a
288   A Grammar of Kakuadubitative modality marker expresses (see Hengeveld 2004:1197 for one definition
of dubitative modality).
        The marker for dubitative modality has two (dialectal) forms: -hin and -hip,
and is glossed ‘DUB’. One form, -hip, is used exclusively by two clans (tõjdaʔwã
‘bitter manioc’ clan and Ɂɨ ̃́ɁwẽɁwã ‘children of blowgun’ clan), while the rest of the
clans seem to use exclusively the -hin form of the dubitative in the same contexts
where -hip is used by the above mentioned clans. I present examples below of this
dubitative marker using data transcribed only for those clans that use the -hin form.
Some of these examples were elicited to ask for the possibility to use the form -hip
instead of -hin. Speakers accepted both forms, though emphasizing that the form
-hip will be the one used by individuals of a different clan (referring then to the clans
tõjdaʔwã and Ɂɨ ̃́ɁwẽɁwã).63) ɲi=beh-hin-jɨʔ=na

    3PL=EVID-be.deep-eat-DUB-NEG=INFERR=INTERR
    ‘perhaps they did not invite (her) to eat?’        It is important to note also that often the form -hin, undergoes a phonetic
reduction to -hĩ. This usually occurs when the dubitative marker is followed by a
clitic having a nasal consonant in the onset position: -hin=C+N  -hĩ=C+N. In these
cases, the vowel in the dubitative marker retains the nasal quality of the morpheme.
        I note that this is the most common phonetic realization of the dubitative
marker in the context mentioned above. However, I have also noted instances in
which the dubitative marker remained -hin even in contexts when it was followed
by a nasal consonant. This is left for future reasearch. Finally, I have not tested this
for the cases of the variant of the dubitative form -hip, and a study on the different
dialectal variations in Kakua will perhaps provide an explanation regarding the status
of the -hip form of the dubitative. An example of the dubitative form, phonetically
reduced to -hĩ ‘DUB’ is given below:65) jěb         ɲi=t-naʔa-hĩ=nit

    ‘do you (all) want, perhaps?’
10.5.2 Frustrative mood =jɨʔ
       The frustrative marker =jɨɁ indicates that the event encoded by the verb did
not occur as expected, or was not fully realized as intended. It can also indicate that
the action was fully realized but without the intended outcome. I thus follow here
the definition of frustrative proposed by Overall (forthcoming: 3), as a grammatical
marker expressing “the non-realization of some expected outcome implied by the
                                          Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality     289proposition expressed in the marked clause.”. The frustrative marker is presented as
an enclitic; however, as seen in Chapter 8, the frustrative can also occur as a suffix,
as in (66), or even detached from any preceding element, as in (68), as discussed
below.66) ɲi=beh-hin-jɨʔ=na

    say=DECL FRUST=DECL
    ‘he said (but failed to accomplished what was said)’        The marker is a suffix in (66) because it precedes the declarative marker,
which is in the first enclitic position of the verb template (see Chapter 8). In (68) it
is a morpheme detached from the preceding elements, because each element of the
clause is taking a declarative marker of its own. The declarative marker is never
marked twice in the same word. When the clause is marked for evidentiality, the
frustrative marker will follow both the declarative marker (as opposed to what is
shown in (66) and (67) above), and the evidential marker. This is illustrated in (69)
below:69) Ɂĩ=tiɁ-nih=na=wɨt=jɨɁ=hĩ
     3PL=EVID-say=DECL=REP.EVID=FRUST=REM.PST
    ‘(it is said) they said but weren’t heard’        As discussed in Müller (2013:106ff), and Overall (forthcoming:7), frustrative
marking does not necessarily overlap with an incompletive meaning, but instead
refers to a situation the outcome of which is contrary to expectations, where the
situation may or may not be completed. Likewise, the frustrative marker in Kakua
refers to the speaker’s expectations regarding the outcome of the proposition, and,
although the frustrative is normally used in propositions that are fully completed, it
is not contradictory with a progressive or telic aspect (§10.2.2 and §10.2.3 above
respectively). An example of Kakua telic aspect co-occurring with the frustrative
mood is given below:

    1SG=HAB-make.prayer-TEL.PROG=FRUST=REM.PST
    ‘I still prayed vainly’ (I used to pray vainly and still am praying)        Kakua has another form that expresses meanings similar to the frustrative
marker =jɨɁ, but that usually functions as a verb,11 not as a grammatical morpheme.
This is the verb najɁ ‘to want to do something but not to be able to’. It is described
here as a ‘borderline’ form between a verb and a functional morpheme, particularly
because of i) its semantics when functioning as a verb versus when used as a
functional morpheme, and ii) because of its morphosyntactic position when
functioning as a verb, different from that when it is a functional morpheme.
        When functioning as a verb, it encodes ‘wanting to perform an event but not
being able to’. When used as a functional morpheme, it conveys that the ability for
performing an event is no longer present, but it is possible to achieve such ability
again. Then it is glossed as ‘WANT.TO’, and functions morphosyntactically as a clitic
(or as a suffix, as future research will have to show), as in the elicited example in
(71). In this example, najʔ conveys that there was the ability to blow, and now the
ability is not there but can be recovered. The ‘blowing’, as opposed to example (72)
below from natural speech, did not occur in vain:71) wã=pĩ-pɨwɁ-ɨp=najɁ=hĩ
    1SG=HAB-blow-PST=WANT.TO=REM.PST
    ‘I used to be able to blow’ (can’t blow now but can try to do it)       As mentioned above, najɁ is not incompatible with the frustrative marker, and
its function is not that of encoding frustrative. This is illustrated in the following
example. Note that the occurrence of the frustrative marker indicates that although
there used to be an ability to perform an event (blowing as part of a shamanic healing
prayer), both the blowing and the ability to perform the blowing do not have the
expected outcome: ‘blew in vain’, and ‘had the ability but that ability can no longer
be recuperated’):72) wã=pĩ-pɨwɁ-ɨp=najɁ=jɨɁ=hĩ
    1SG=HAB-blow-PST=WANT.TO=FRUST=REM.PST
    ‘I used to be able to blow in vain’ (used to blow in vain but now I can’t and
    can’t try either).","[308, 309, 310, 311]"

1.6     Kakua dialects and clans
       Kakua is subdivided into two main dialect areas: the Kakua spoken in the
areas surrounding the village of Wacará, and the Kakua spoken in the areas
surrounding Nuevo Pueblo. These two areas have some degree of dialectal variation
occurring mainly in their lexicon and phonology.
       The most salient phonological differences that I was able to perceive are a
correspondence between the Wacará́ [ʧ] to [ts] in Nuevo Pueblo, and Wacará́ [a] to
Nuevo Pueblo [ɨ]. The first of these two correspondences occurs everywhere in the
lexicon where these sounds are found. The second correspondence occurs mainly in
the following: Wacará kǎnɁ ‘3SG.F’ and -kan ‘NEG’, corresponds to Nuevo Pueblo
kɨnɁ ‘3SG.F’ and -kɨn ‘NEG’. It also occurs with the assertion marker, which for Kakua
of Wacará is =ka, while for Kakua of Nuevo Pueblo is =kɨ.11 A discussion        11 Note that /a/, /ɨ/ and /k/ are attested phonemes in both dialects. With further research on
dialectal variation it would be interesting to test if at some point there was a diachronic process in which

found in Chapter 8.
        Additionally, the Kakua people of Nuevo Pueblo express a spatial or temporal
deictic difference in the assertion clitic. Whenever the referent is located or the event
is occurring near the speaker, the assertion form of the clitic is =ka ‘ASS.PROX’;
when the referent is located or the event occurs further away from the speaker, the
assertion form is =kɨ ‘ASS.DIST’.
        Another phonological difference between the Kakua spoken in Wacará and
the Kakua spoken in Nuevo Pueblo, is that the Wacará varieties have completely
merged the /o/ and /u/ phonemes into one single /u/ phoneme. The difference is
maintained in the varieties of Kakua spoken in Nuevo Pueblo.
        Given that my work concentrated on the village of Wacará, at this point I
cannot provide further details on dialectal variation. For example, no grammatical
features such as morphosyntactic or further phonological features were studied
during the time when the data for this grammar was being collected.
        In each of the dialect areas, different clans also have different clan-dialect
variations. This was not studied either. Below I only list the clans of speakers of the
Kakua spoken in Wacará.́ Some of these clans, such as the hɨ ̌wɁwã clan are originally
from the area of Nuevo Pueblo, and speakers of this clan, though having been born
in Wacará, still use many of the dialectal differences (lexical and phonological) found
in the Kakua variety spoken in Nuevo Pueblo.
        All Kakua clan names are invariably marked with the plural number marker
for animate entities –wã ‘PL.AN’:Table 1.1 Kakua clans in Wacará
 CLAN NAME                                             CLAN TRANSLATION

 tõjdaʔwã                                            ‘clan bitter manioc’        According to the Kakua speakers of Wacará, most of them considered that
the most conservative variety of Kakua was that spoken by the tõjdaʔwã clan. They,
it was said, are the ones who still speak like the forefathers, with strong tonal
distinctions and a slow paused speech, the tõjdaʔwã clan “almost don’t erase sounds”
when speaking.
a merger of /ɨ/ and /a/ occurred in one dialect, conditioned by preceding /k/, giving birth to the sole form
=ka in the variants of Kakua spoken in Wacará, and keeping the difference of =ka ~ =kɨ in the variants
of Kakua spoken in Nuevo Pueblo.
18    A Grammar of Kakua        A correspondence that I did find between the tõjdaʔwã clan and the rest of
the clans in Wacará,́ however, was that many words that started with the combination
of sounds [ʧa] would be pronounced as [ha], where the sound [ʧ] would correspond
to [h]. The word [ʧãh] ‘do’, for example, is invariably pronounced [hãh] ‘do’ by the
tõjdaʔwã clan. Also, the intensifier which is pronounced [=tiɁ] ‘INTS’ in all other
clans, is pronounced as [=ti] by members of the tõjdaʔwã clan.
        I look forward to future work focusing on the dialectal variations in Kakua,
and exploring the diachronic and synchronic developments that a dialectal study can
help explain.","[38, 39, 40]"

10.3 Mood: illocution and modality
        The modal categories in Kakua are very versatile and encode many more
distinctions than any other category related to the event or situation encoded by the
predicate.
        While tense and aspect deal with temporal particularities of a proposition
(‘external temporal constituency’ and ‘internal temporal constituency’, respectively,
as in Comrie 1976:3), mood deals with finer specifications regarding the status of
the proposition, reflecting a speaker’s attitude towards the proposition, “not directly
concerned with situating an event in the actual world, as conceived by the speaker”
(Hengeveld 2004:1190). Consequently, mood in Kakua is described here as the
morphological category that is not anchored to an expression of time, but rather it is
concerned with expressing “the status of the proposition” describing the event (I
follow here Palmer’s 2001 general definition of mood). This is to say, mood in Kakua
conforms to a cross-linguistic grammatical category that expresses something about
the speaker’s view of the proposition (c.f. Bybee 1990, Palmer 2001, Hengeveld
2004 for discussions of mood).
        Hengeveld (2004) proposes a subdivision of the category of mood into
illocution and modality, illocution being “instances of specific types of speech acts”,
while modality is “concerned with the modification of the content of speech acts”
(Hengeveld 2004:1190). In the subsequent sections I follow Hengeveld’s division of
mood, and describe separately illocution and modality as categories of mood in
Kakua. The motivation for adopting Hengeveld’s division of mood categories is
mainly a semantic one. Dividing the mood markers in Kakua into two groups helps
                                                  Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality            281to better describe their semantics: illocution markers are ‘unqualified’ expressions
of the speech acts, whereas modality markers do express the type of relationship,
expectations, or attitude of the speaker towards the content of these speech acts
(modality can “modify the content of the speech acts” ibid). Additionally, only the
group of illocution markers can constitute types of clauses. The same cannot be said
for the modality markers, which do not form types of clauses (there are no clauses
such as ‘frustrative clauses’ or ‘dubitative clauses’).
        The semantics of these categories are described in the subsequent sections.
Section §10.4 describes grammatical morphemes encoding illocution, 5 and section
§10.5 describes the different morphemes expressing modality. Evidentiality is
presented separately in §10.6. Note that all three categories are considered to be part
of the overall mood category in Kakua.
        A formal distinction between illocution and modality, as presented in
Hengeveld (2004), is that “in the expression of illocution the morphological category
of mood has to compete with word order and intonation as markers of particular
subdistinctions, whereas modality is expressed by mood markers only” (Hengeveld
2004:1190). As shown in the subsequent sections, although one of the illocution
morphemes comes along with a particular intonation, it is not necessarily the case
that illocution morphemes in Kakua, as opposed to modality morphemes, compete
in terms of word order and intonation with other subdistinctions. Rather, I will say
that the primary distinction between illocution markers and modality markers in
Kakua, is that, as stated above, illocution markers have the ability to indicate a clause
type, whereas modality markers does not.
        Morphosyntactically, it cannot be said that there is a distinction that
characterizes one or the other type of mood. Although most of these markers have
their own dedicated morphosyntactic slots, and while most occur following the stem
(as suffixes or enclitics), there are some in prefixing position (specifically
evidentiality markers).","[301, 302]"
"        When the possibility of stating the sentence in (73) above was checked with
native speakers two things happened. Firstly, speakers hesitantly accepted the
construction but evaluated it as strange. Secondly, speakers tried to make sense of
the construction but the meaning changed quite a bit: the frustrative marker had
scope only over the verb najʔ ‘want but can not do’, and not over the verb pɨwɁ
‘blow’. Thus, the meaning of the construction was given as: ‘I used to blow
(successfully), and I used to want but can’t do blowing, but now I don’t want and
can’t do.’
        Examples (66) to (73)above show that there is a fascinating field awaiting to
be explored regarding not only the semantics of a contra-expected outcome of a
situation, but also regarding the development of grammatical morphemes in Kakua
expressing modality distinctions.",[312]
