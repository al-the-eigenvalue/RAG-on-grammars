"  Interestingly, short answers to yes/no questions in Warao
exhibit a. peculiar phonology:    they are often more like
paralinguistic utterances than like ordinary morphemes, for
instance, affirmative uh—hunh and negative unh-uhn. which may
be furnished as answers in the language. These expressions are
nasalised since they must flow out through the nose given
total closure at lip level.",[34]
"
   Embedding    in  Warao implies one     clause    holding   a
hypatactical relation with another, whose linkage may be
indicated either by an inflectional morpheme in association
with aspect/mood, or by an independent word        (a sort of
complementizer), or by nothing. The possibilities of combining
negative and non-negative main and embedded clauses, no matter
the kind of linkage between them, are:     (i) negative main
clause/non-negative embedded clause, (ii) non—negative main
clause/negative embedded clause, and     (iii) negative main
clause/negative embedded clause.    In the types in    (i) and
(iii), negation has a broad scope covering the           entire
sentence. Within this context, negation, morpho-syntactically
speaking, operates just as it does within the simplex sentence
context.  Examples of the combinations in (i) and    (iii) are
offered in (59)

  In Warao, the repeating of the verb in a yes/no echo
question is obligatory, such as it is shown in     (51). This
response may be preceded by the affirmative words nome 'yes'
and tuatane 'it is so', or the negative tuatane ana 'it is not
so' .","[33, 34]"

  12. NEGATION
  12.1. Simplex sentence negation (or main clause negation)
  Negation is expressed by means of the suffix -naka 'NEG',
whose scope is the entire sentence. The negative marker —naka
'NEG' is directly attached to the verb root, possibly followed
by a mood marker if the need arises to indicate modality
overtly. It is convenient to state that all unmarked for mood
main clauses are in the indicative. Once —naka 'NEG' has been
added to the verb root, the inflectional markers for number
and aspect/tense appear on the auxiliary verb ta 'AUX'. For
example, the negative sentence in X53)
                                 27

       ’Your -father comes'                                     i  Other examples illustrating positional changes undergone by
verb in-flections in negative sentences are shown in the pairs
below

            morokoto I   eat     OPT AUX NON-PAST
            'I want to eat fish'
  In (55), -naka ’NEG’ breaks the verb inflectional string,
inducing the presence of the auxiliary on which aspect j and
tense must appear. In (56) —naka ’NEG’ admits a followingjmood
marker,   in this case —turu 'OPT', which in turn disrupts the
verb inflectional chain, bringing about tense suffixing to the
auxiliary   (In Warao mood markers as well as negative, and
interrogative markers are closing morphemes, so they do, not,
allow further suffixing. Once they break the verb inflectional
chain, the auxiliary becomes the locus for tense/aspectj and
number markers. ISee 26.1.2.3. and 26.1.2.33.             :  12.2. Negation in some sentential constituents                ■

  12.3. Complex sentence negation
  For complex coordinate sentences which relate two (or more)
finite  (or tensed) clauses paratactically, negation operates
such as in simplex sentences: —naka 'NEB' is suffixed to the
verb of one or the other clause, or both, depending on whether
conjointness  (or disjointness), or adverseness is involved.
Such an addition of the negation marker to verbs triggers :the
regular tense and aspect inflection movements linked to the
presence of the auxiliary ta 'AUX' elsewhere.","[36, 37]"
"
  To question constituents within postpositional phrases, the
corresponding head nouns must be replaced by the proper
interrogative pronoun. The following pair illustrate the case:
  (48) a. atono     kaika oka naru —ki —tia
          Antonio   with we go      INT HAB
          (Anthony)

              (lit.) 'The canoe of whom sank?', or
              'Itlhose canoe sank'  In the absence of interrogative pronouns to question about
place,   time,   quantity or amount, etc.,      (Warao   lacks
interrogatives with where, when, how many connotation), the
language uses sina 'who' and kasikaha 'what' as interrogative
determiners which modify nouns referring to location, time,
currency, price, etc., giving the idea of what place?. what
day?, what Quantity?, who individual?, etc. Some examples are
shown in (50)
  (50) a. kasikaha ama a hokahi        eku

              'What Warao da/will hurry the work?’
  11.3. Echo questions  Warao echo questions require no special answer words. Simple
affirmative or negative responses to questions may involve
repeating the verb of the question, with or without additional
material:       YES/NO ECHO QUESTION
  (51) A: ama a hokahi ata oka yaota -te

"
  11.1. Yes/no questions
  Warao marks yes/no questions with the sentence—final verb
suffix —ra ’INTERROG’ in the absence of constituent order
change  from declarative. Yes/no questions are      normally
neutral; i.e.,
         l .e.  their marker and arrangement do not lead to

"          10.1.2. |1.1. Clausal conjunction
      .Clausal! conjunction takes place when referents in subject
     and/or object roles within two paratactical1y-related clauses
     do not change, making possible reduction in one of them. Even
     when the1 two clauses may keep:all their constituents— in a
     sort of full coordinate sentence— such as      j (20) o s i b u 1,, h o s e i t o         yaba    -n   -a   —e      teka      tai
      I ..'i ,mo‘rokDto Joseito                  fish    =g    PUNC PAST   peccary   he

      kub -a     —e
      hunt PUNC PAST
      'Joe fished morokoto (and) he hunted peccary',
  it is likely that repeated subjects and/or objects       undergo
ellipsis, such as illustrated in (21)
  (21) osibu    hoseito   yaba -n -a  —e      teko     0
       morokoto Joseito   fish sg PUNC PAST    peccary
       (kind of (Joe)
       fish)      kub   -a   -e
      hunt   PUNC PAST
      'Joe fished morokoto (and)   (he) hunted peccary’
  Another example of clausal conjunction is offered in (22)
  (22) aru    tai kona -n -a     -e    hi sab -a  —e
       manioc he bring sg F'UNC PAST cook      PUNC PAST
       ’He brought manioc (and) (he) cooked (manioc)’
  10.1.2.1.2. Clausal adversative junction
  Paratactical clauses may also suggest an         adversative
linkage.  Adversative coordination is normally encoded by
negating one of the clauses within the sentence. This is often
the case in Warao, as illustrated in (23)
  (23) a. tai   ine hahobu     —bu -a   —e    mi -naka
          3sg.O I   search for ITER PUNC PAST see NEG
          ’I searched for him repeatedly (but) (I did) not see
          (him)’       b. warao ekoro —naka —te      musimo        ekoro
          Warao finish NEG   NON-PAST Carib people finish
          (lit.)  ’The Warao do not finish (but) the Caribs
          finish’, or
          'The Carib are terminated, but the Warao are not’
  There    are   also instances of antithetical adversative
junction in which apposite lexical meaning (in the absence of
the negation marker —naka ’NEG’) is sufficient to express
adverseness:
                              14
         (24) tama -tika -mo sanuka    tai mi -na —te

         j,     from right over there’        10.1.2.1.3. Clause disjunction
    .    1 ' ■: ■
      Disjunction conveys the idea of exclusion. In Waraa, the
    logics of discourse is the only        resource to be used for
    determining which clause content excludes the other one.
    Disjunction   seems not to be         well integrated      in   the
    interclausal   relations   of     the   language.    Warao—Spanish
    bilingual speakers who know the use of              the     Spanish
    disjunctive: coordinates frequently express doubts about the
    appropriatness of examples when asked to     attest     them. They
    sometimes frame their disjunctive coordinates upon the Spanish
    framework incorporating o ’o r ’ to their native utterance.    The
    best example collected in my data is presented in (25) below
! , (25) yatu nao -te         nao —naka ta -te     —ra
I         you   come NON-PAST come NEB AUX NON-PAST INTERROG

postposi tions of the language.j omi 'deprived of someone, or
something' is inherently negative denoting the manner how the

        container (since it is lacking)!’                I 25.3. Comitative
  Comitative is expressed by means of the postposition kaika
'in the companion o f ’ or 'with someone’. This postposition
conveys   the comitative sense by indicating someone : in
association with which some entity was or is, or was or is
during the enactment of a situation. In the fallowing example,
the noun phrase in constituency with kai ka 'with someone'
represents someone the actor was in association with while
enacting the situation:
  (23B) atono     kaika oka naru -ki —tia
        Antonio   with we go      INT HAB
        (Anthony)
        'We are going with Anthony as usual'
  As well, the presence of kai ka 'with someone' may imply,that
the entity which it introduces is typically of higher status
than the one representing the partner, as in (239)
  (239) bare     fcaika warao orabakaya ha
        father   with Warao four        COP
        (priest)
        'Four Warao are with the priest (they are    under   the
        priest's responsibility)'
  (239) reveals the kind of relationship that the Warao      and
the missionaries keep, which is often one in which           the
religious leaders are official authorities protecting        the
natives.","[96, 97]"

  As for morphology and syntax, the speakers of any language,
may   accomplish a great many communicative tasks with i the
sentences of their language. In this regard, Sadock & Zwicky
(1979) note that speakers'   conventional conversational uses
let narrate a tale, report what someone knows or has heard,
suggest a joint action, give permission to do something, 1 and
so on. For some of these uses, a language will have   specific
syntactic constructions, or even specific forms, reserved (just
for these uses— special particles, affixes,      word   order,
elliptical   arrangements, etc.— that will keep a connection
with the rales of the   participants and that ultimately will
depend upon particular styles. All of the above lead to
conclude that style heavily conditions the lexicon, phonology,
morphology and syntax of a language. Under such circumstances,
styles are code variants of language used in specific ways and
with particular purposes.","[120, 121]"

  This Jl research concerns War a o , a language isolate          of
Wne'ziiera.           Its goals ' are  twofold:    it     offers    a
typoiogicaliy-oriented referente grammar of the language, and
it.:also describes, on the grounds of sociolinguistic data, the
speech styles observed in.Warao. I have striven to make the
grammar j a s ’ .general as possible, covering as many topics as
possible; , in. a f ramework that is understandable and usable by
linguists of all theoretical persuasions. Additionally, I have
endeavoured           to  depict styles by    considering    language
structures           that  correlate with spatial,    temporal    and
referenbialtcontent factors, as well as social factors defined

ONE •.. that provides generalities about the research and the
language, in the first part, consisting of SECTIONS TWO, THREE
and/j FOUR, I offer syntactic, morphological and phonological
features of* Warao.          In the remaining part, consisting of
SECTION FIVE, I describe speech acts, participants roles and
styles detected in the language. For the purposes of handling
the contents, all throughout this investigation, SECTIONS have
been! divided into SUB-SECTIONS numbered correlatively from 1.
through''34.'Further Sub—diVisibns are included, also numbered
in, correspondence with that numeric entry identifying the
sub—section to which they are asbcribed.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"

  At this point of the analysis, it is worth noting that all
Warao comparatives arrange the standards o-f comparison before
the topics of comparison, and these before the marker iof
comparison that is part of the verbal core, which is the
positional relationship to be held since the language is OSV.
These comparatives prove affirmative my QSV order hypothesis
for Warao.","[24, 25]"
"  The type in (ii) corresponds to complex sentences in which
negation has a narrower scope. In this type, negation is
restricted only to the embedded portion of the whole sentence,
such as shown in (60)

  13.   DIRECT SPEECH
  Warao   allows direct—quote complements only      with   the
utterance verb dibukitane 'to say'. The Warao speaker merely
passes on the direct quote complement as a more-or— less
verbatim quotation. Conversely, indirect-quote complements do
not occur in the language. In these respects, Warao behaves as
most languages,   in which indirection    ""is absent probably
because it implies a certain paraphrase that leads to take
editorial responsibilities on the part of speakers.      Those
responsibilities are reflected in the control of co-reference
pronouns.  Thus, speakers of such languages take a much more
limited     responsibility    restricting    themselves     to
direct-quotes,   which, of course, exert      less   editorial
tampering"" (Giv6n, 1983:121).",[38]

  S fronting and the reversing of the order of D ’s is commoun
in statements as well. In such cases, variations from the
basic order are conditioned by the discourse environment,
marking a diversity of functions including focus— this    time
highlighting. and providing new information rather        than
requesting it as in the case of interrogatives.       A FOCUS
FRONTING RULE may account for orders different from OSV in
statements. The operation of this rule is illustrated below:  (69) a. atono      saba yasi yak    -era tai nisa -te
          Antonio    for hat goodness AUGM he buy    NON—PAST
           (Anthony)

 , It seems very likely that in OSV and DATIVE OSV sentences, a
 ;constraint against fronting more than one constituent in a
!|sentence' regulates the operativity of the FOCUSING RULE.         In
j (69V, it may be noticed that when S, or direct 0, is fronted,
 tno movement of other constituents takes place. In my view, the
  constrained J operativity of the FOCUS FRONTING RULE acts in
j favor of my hypothesis of OSV as the basic order in the
Jlanguage. ■ |

 i Furthermore,,some obliques may appear post-verbally. This is
| particularly true of OSV and DATIVE OSV sentences with
I obliques, in which the latter may be thought to be more
•peripheral constituents.         It is my contention that the more
iperipheral a constituent of the Warao basic simplex sentence
J is, the freer its placement:            (70) a. ama      ebe   hanokosebe   eku —ya kasiri aisiko

   (70-71) show that obliques may appear in several different
places within sentences. But obliques often precede or follow
other DSV sequences; at least this is true of sentences having
direct D ’s such as the ones in (70), as well as sentences
containing several obliques such as those in      (71). (71c),
which is the only sentence within (71) not exhibiting ;GSV
order, reflects the operation of the FOCUS FRONTING RULE upon
the subject of the sentence; therefore,      (71c) has to| be
S-initial. It might be thought that the basic position of (the
more peripheral constituents within the Warao basic simplex
sentence is final, and that they are fronted by the FOCUS
FRONTING RULE in a way similar to that of moving subjects,
direct objects, etc. I find such possibilities inappropriate
since as (71c) shows, the FOCUS FRONTING RULE would have! to
front more than one sentential constituent at a time. I Have
painted out earlier in this analysis that there is ( a
constraint against a fronting movement of more than ,ane
constituent;   such a constraint favors my OSV word order
hypothesis and, clearly, my accepting of a multifranting
operation for the FOCUSING RULE would weaken it since I would
be using rules to explain free order rather than OSV order.   I
view the change in position of some obliques as motivated by a
kind of relationship that operate in discourse called staging
relationships. Grimes    (1975:113) paints out that ""staging
relationships are concerned with expressing the speaker's
perspective on what is being said"".       Additionally, Grimes
 (1975:323) indicates that ""every clause, sentence, paragraph,
episode and discourse is organised around a particular element
that is taken as its point of departure. It is as though jthe
speaker presents what he wants to say from a particular
perspective.   I find it convenient to think in terms of how
various units are staged for the hearer's benefit"".        !'","[41, 42, 43]"
"
  However, —ra ’INTERROG’ cannot be directly attached after
the negation marker -naka 'NEG' as well as same mood markers
that break the verbal inflection string. In those cases, —ra
'INTERROG'  is added to the auxiliary ta 'AUX', which is a
locus for tense,    aspect and questioning, under specific
conditions. An example is presented in (41) below
  (41) naba muhoko tatuma    waba -komoni
       river side of they    die  NEG.POT        t   —a ■ —e   -ra
        AUX PUNC PAST INTERROG
        'Couldn’t they die on that side of the river?’
  -ra   'INTERROG'   must be present     in   those   contexts
corresponding to the following two types of questions:     (i)
yes/no questions, and (ii) question—word questions. Rising
intonation is associated with questioning. This matter has not
been sufficiently explored by the author though.",[29]
"
  Structurally speaking, nominal (label covering denominal
adjective—like   nouns    and     adverb—functioning     nouns)
comparatives in Warao consist of    two sentences     holding a
paratactical   relation, one containing the       standard,   of
comparison and the other containing the topic of comparison.
Some constituents which are repeated in the standard and topic
clauses, that is to say, that are common to both, are often
deleted, and the remaining are joined together to give rise to
an elliptical comparative sentence. Thus, at a level below the
surface, for example, (26b) and (26d) would respectively ;have
syntactic configurations as follows in (27a0 and (27b):    ;
                                                           I  (27) a. Cihi kubatu yak    —era ha 3 Choseito kubatu

   .On the other hand, -from the review o-f (26-28), some -facts of
 importance about the Warao comparatives are: (i) the language
 uses analytical comparison'exclusively, and (ii) it lacks an
 element that 'may be considered to have the status of a
 ""complementizer"".   Related to '(ii), in the absence of a
;""d:ompiemehtiZer""-like element,ino alternative mechanism such
 as case—marking of the standard Iof comparison is used.","[23, 24]"
"  So   far, basic OSV order for Warao has been         exemplified     in
                                6
each    of the major sentence types.      However,   structural
arrangements different from OSV are often found in the
language.   It is common in WaraD discourse to leave out P ’s
whose referents have been set' up earlier. Since the person of
the object of transitive verbs may be     marked in the verb,
transitive.. sentences occur frequently with the verb and the
subject; only. For example, (B) below      TRANSITIVE OSV
  (B) ma     hi       rakoi ahi -a   —e
      lsg.O 2sg.POS sister hit ! PUNC PAST
      'Your sister hit me’  may be reduced as in:       TRANSITIVE SV
! (9) 0 hi        rakoi m—           ahi   —a    -e
; ! :‘    2sg.P0S sister lsg.Q       hit    PUNC PAST
   ( : 'Your sister hit me'   On the other hand, copulative sentences in Warao nearly
always      are      subject    initial,     showing     mostly
S—COMP(lement)—CPF' (ula) order. Further, ha —kitane ‘BE/HAVE
— INFINIT.’, the form denoting ‘COP’ may be deleted giving rise
to S-CQMP order. The examples below illustrate the case:
          COPULATIVE S-COMP-COP
  <1Q) a. tai tira burebaka ha
   i      that;woman insane   COP
          ’That woman is insane’          COPULATIVE S-COMP
       b. tai tira burebaka O
          that woman insane
   1      ’That woman (is) insane’
  Different from 0 and COP which, as shown, may not explicitly
appear in the Warao sentence, B tends to be expressed. This is
so ;because the WaraD verb is unmarked for subject agreement;
hence, subjects need to be present to avoid ambiguities and
misunderstandings. A subjectless sentence such as (lib) below
is exclusively motivated by the discourse environment:   (lib)
ohviously reflects a short answer to a question:
  (11) a. Q: ihi    ma     kaika nao —nak.a        —ra
             2sg.S lsg.O with come NEG              INTERROB
             ’Don’t you come with me?’       b. A: 0    nao —naka
                  come NEG
             ’ (I) do not come’
                                 7
                                                               1
  The process illustrated by til) above involves a principle
of economy of words which operates in languages wherever the
logic of conversational sequences allows no possible confusion
                                                            1
  From the review of (1-10), the facts of imnportance about
Warao word order are: ti > V is final, (ii) S nearly always
immediately precedes V, and (iii) D mostly occurs in sentence
initial position. Ahead in this Section, the rules that permit
variations from the basic QSV order    are    discussed    and
explained.                                                  I  7. VERBAL SENTENCES                                       ■

  All Warao verbs have subjects, although they may,    or may
not, attract other constituents, such as objects,      subject

the proper noun wauta 'Wauta' seen in (12b), both filling in

  Subjects in Warao lack morphological devices that allow
their identification; for instance, they are not case-marked.
This feature coupled with the fact that Waran is a verb final
language in which the remaining sentence constituents    (both
subject and objects)     usually precede, make subjects very
resistant to deletion. It      might   be expected that overt
subjects contribute to preserve meaning.     Subjects normally
express the agent     of    the action, if there is one. This

    or jthe, other, their inflectional behavior overrides such a
    distinction1, so' that    no    different    sets of markers to
    operate: in! transitive or intransitive contexts exist. Warao

  7.4. Oblique abject (or adjunct)  The remaining arguments kaken by Ularao verbs give shape ,to
the oblique objects, also referred in this studyy as adjuncts.
Adjuncts are integrated into the structure of the sentence
being affected by such processes as negation and questioning,
keeping with verbs the same kind of relationship whatever
their underlying semantic roles might be. Such roles include
manner,  locative, time, instrumental, comitative, source,
possessive, benefactive and cause. These meanings may be
expressed by   (i) simple and compound (derived)  adverbs and
adverbials, which are normally denominal, denoting manner,
place and time, and (ii) postpositional phrases expressing
placement and location in time, as    well   as    possession,
benefactive, origin and some other meanings.      Obliques or
adjuncts are exhaustively described and exemplified in 24. and
25.","[16, 17]"

  8. COPULATIVE SENTENCES
  ha 'COP' in Warao never functions as an existential.    Thus,
it may be drawn that copulatives are quite limited in their
semantic scape. The copula, ha 'COP' has three well-defined
predicative   functions:    (i)   equative,   expressing    the
identification of one entity with another, (ii) attributive,
characterizing entities, and (iii) adverbial, denoting time
and place. In all of these three functions, ha. 'COP' is a link
between the subject and the predicate. Throughout this study,
predicates in copulative sentences are handled with in two
ways: (i) as subject complements when employed in relation to
nominal items    (nouns and attribute nouns, also called here
adjective—like attributives), which is the case with equative
                              10
and attributive predicates, and (ii) as adjuncts when employed
in relation to time and place expressions, which is the case
with adverbial, predicates, Examples of the types of copulative
sentences in Warao are presented in (15):
          EQUATIVE
  (15) a. ine warab ha yatu hotarao     0
   •      I   Warao COP you non-warao
          'I am Warao (and) you (are) non—Warao (or criollo)1
          ATTRIBUTIVE
       b. tama, —ha hoko         , ha
          this NOM shade of any COP
                    light color
          (lit.) 'This one is light-colored', or
          ‘This one has a light color', or
          'This one is white'
          ADVERBIAL
          TIME
      .c. ine kura           warao isaka     ha
          I    The Pleiads   Warao one       COP
               (annual path) (twenty)
          'I am twenty years old'            PLACE
       d.    mahoka      ayakata    ama      —te   ha
            cattish     school ot that yonder LOG COP
                        tish
            (lit.)    'The school ot cattish is (in) over there’
  The copula ha may be deleted it its coreterent is in an
immediate preceding utterance, as shown in (15a). It intlects
only for past tense:
            ine ma—     omu a namo ha
            I   lsg-POS foot of caver COP
            'I have my shoes'            ine ma­       □mu a namo ha —e
            I   ilsg. POS -foot of cover COP PAST
            ’I had my shoes'  9. STATIVE SENTENCES  The suffix -ira 'STAT' attached to attribute nouns turn them
into stative verbs meaning 'be in the state of*. Sentences
containing denominal stative verbs are objectless, denoting a
permanent or temporary state in which the subject (animate or
inanimate)  is a patient—of-state, such as in the following
                                 II
                                                         ]
                                                         i
examples:
  (17) a. waraa -tuma ta       -era -ira -te
          Uaran PL     stregth AUGM STAT NON—PAST

                                                         t
  The most common way offorming    complex   structures in
subject, object and oblique roles appears to be by parataxis.
Also, parataxis is observed in some complex sentences in which
two or more clauses are simply juxtaposed, with no indication
of the temporal, spatial, causal, or whatever, relationship
between them.
                                                         ;   <■

  10.1.1. Paratactical phrases                           j
  Paratactical phrases are structures containing 2 (or more)
non-conjoined references to the same entity, or containing 2
(or more) references to the same entity      (or to different
ones), conjoined without coordinating conjunctions.   Against
this background, there have been specified for Warao, the
fallowing      functions      of      phrasal      parataxis:
identification/modification and coordination.           !","[17, 18, 19]"
"  24.1. General modifiers  These   items   and   attributive nouns    do   not   differ
morphologically. Their adverbial connotation is set up by the
relationship they hold with the verb to which they adjoin. For
example!  (172) dakobo rakobo hi-       esemoi aisia asa
        brother brother Isg.POS flute with badness        wara —ki —tia —ine

           'Those fought bravely’                                70
 :24.2. Manner adverbs i    ^           i'              -i        ‘
  Manner :is usually expressed by the pair tuatane ’thus' and
tuatane ana 'not thus"" preceding verbs. This usage suggests an
extra pragmatic -force in the verb:
 ; (175), monida:  ebe        iwirinoko a iramo tuatane
          sickness because of Wirinoko o-f chief thus           , .eicoro —n —a    —e
          ’; ; finish' sg PIINC PAST
               '.The chief of Wirinoko finished (died) thus because of
               sickness'
     (176) tuatane ana nana —naka ta —n —a   —e
          1 thus     no do     NEB AUX sg PUNC PAST
            'He did not do (it) (not) thus'  Furthermore, manner may be denoted by the postposition tane
'manner/way of doing something’ attached to nouns, which gives
rise to postpositional phrases functioning as either comple­
ments in copulatives, or adjuncts in other types of sentences:
 t(177)' irtare  tane   naru -Icotu
         silence manner go    2pl.IMP
         'You all, go silently!’

           jaguar', or
           'We thought (that) you were like a jaguar'  Manner   is   also encoded by means of       the   privative
postposition omi   'PRIV or 'without' which is intended for
preventing the entity to which is attached from the effects of
the verb of the sentence, creating an opposite meaning:                                       71

  In (181), ka omi indicates that in the manner of doing
things, there is a suppresion of the participation of some
previous participants.                                ,  24.3. Location adverbials                                                         i
  Adverbial location is expressed by either a small set, of
deictic locatives, or a large set Qf postpositional phrases,
or a few adverbs of place.                              ^
  24.3.1. Deictic locatives                                 *
  The set of deictic locatives derives from the demonstrative

set of ""general"" local case markers of the language, with the
exception of —ti ka and ^a which seem to be pertinent to. the
deictic locatives.   Also, TABLE 13 reveals that such local
markers may co-occur to increase the level of specificity of
the locatives, which makes them morphologically complex. :Some

  In cases of elliptical answers to yes/no questions, such as
in (75), any constituent other than the verb may be left out.
For question-word questions (and echo questions as well), any
constituent may be elided.  (iv) Copulative sentences:  The copula is omitted very frequently. It seems that,     in
Warao, the copula is the LOCUS for past tense. Non—past tense
is not marked in the copula. The copula in this language is a
sort of semantically—empty dummy verb. Copulative sentences,
temporarily unmarked simply do not need the dummy carrier:  (77) a. dims   a kabesekuhu     irida    O
          father of pair of pants bigness
          'The pants of my father (are) big'

■.». I iJ ,.M ‘ I                     ;
 ;, Transitive subjects of passives1 may, or may not, be overtly
expressed, ! Occurrences of elliptical      passives    transitive
subjects usually imply identity across sentence boundaries,
i .e"". , their antecedents are in any preceding sentence.       In
Wariao    passives,   the agentive postposition       aisia   ’by'
introduces the underlying transitive subject, whereas the verb
of the sentence (or the auxiliary, if necessary)     suffixes the
completive, past tense marker        ’COMP’ and the perfective
aspect marker -ha 'PERF':
  (7B) a. tama —ha a namu        ma   aisia nona —i   —ha
          this NOM of container lsg.O by    make COMP PERF

   . ■ , ,i ’.The container of this one was made (He didn’t make
              it, but someone else did)'  The elided transitive subject of the passive leaves the
postposition aisia   'by' as a trace, which makes eminently
clear that a doer exist, even when it remains unspecified.
  (vi) Possessive phrases:
  In Warao, a-possessive noun phrases may be reduced by
eliding the possessor, with retention of the postposition
                                                                  ml u
'of'. Elliptical a-possessives take place under anaphori
correspondences, depending upon who the speakers are and their
roles in the events being narrated:  (79) a. tai a nibora ribu —n —a    —e
          she of man    say   sg PUNC PAST
          'The husband of hers said'       b.   0   a nibora ribu —n —a    -e

  17. ANAPHORA
  The presence of full noun phrases is generally interpreted
as a signal of pragmatically—marked contexts. Such items often
introduce new information in discourse or clarify referents
when sufficient ambiguity has arisen in a piece of speech.. For
Warao, this assertion seems to be rather valid because -full;
noun phrases have a low rate of occurrence in speech,! as
compared, far instance, with free and bound pronouns, which'
are primary means of referring to participants in discourse.
Free and bound pronouns couple with contextual     information
that helps to identify participants,       allowing a    proper
development of the speech sequences and favoring adequate!,
interpretation of the messages:                            t

                 -one’ ‘ in' (81b) lacks a coreferent and rather introduces a new
                 character.1 Further, -ine ’I ’ in‘ (81c) and (81e), as a bound

"          15. 'FOCUS -(Romero—Figueroa, 1985)      Warao,. permits variations,, from the basic OS9 order. Far
    example, S is moved to initial position in question—word
    questioning: 1      (66)    •siha tama — ha   ribu —te •      —ra

accounted -for by an obligatory rule of WH—QUESTION MOVEMENT.
In (66), the -focal point has been fronted. The concept focal
point or focus here is somewhat similar to that of new
information:  it applies to what is requested through the
question rather than to what is already common knowledge or
pressuposed. Thus, the fronting of the focus is a dominant
device far question formation in Warao. Since all major
sentence constituents may be questioned in the language, when
WH-movement operates upon sentences having multiple objects,
i.e., sentences containing direct objects plus        indirect
objects   with or without obliques, or sentences containing
several oblique objects, such movements have the effect of
reversing the position of some of them respecting the others.
Far instance, the questioning of the direct object of i a
sentence such as in (67)
  (67) buare       aisiko ibure    hua    n      -a   -e
       machete     with   wild pig Juan   kill    PUNC PAST
       (big knife)                 (John)
       'John killed a wild pig with a machete'
  implies the fronting of such a direct abject which makes the
oblique appear after the direct object in the interrogative
farm of the sentence:
  (6B) kasikaha buare       aisiko hua
       what     machete     with   Juan
                (big knife)         (John)       n   —a   —e   —ra
       kill PUNC PAST INTERROG
       'What did John kill with the machete?'","[40, 41]"
"                    Moreover^, the, verb number marker -na 'sg' in several of the
                 sentences of the narrative in          (81) sets up a sort of
                 cor-eferential | relationship with; the     sentential   subjects

                 ta| the fact that third person subjects are usually left out,
                 the .number marker in the verb acts as a meaning-preserving

to be irrelevant   Waraa relatives tit Comrie’s characterization at RC a s ' a
construction consisting necessarily ot a head noun and a ‘rc
which restricts such a head noun by giving a proposition that
must be true ot the actual reterent ot the overall sentence
(Comrie,    1981:136),     In    agreement    with     Camrie’s
characterization, Keenan (1935:141) points ou that RC's are
tull noun phrases consisting at a determiner, a common noun
and an rc. Keenan adds that semantically the common noun
(henceforth N) determines a class of objects, called the
domain of relativization and the rc identifies the sub—set of
the domain, those elements which satisfy the condition given
by the RC. In Waraa R C ’s, the domain N occurs within the rc,
which makes them internal (as opposed far instance to English,
in which the domain N occurs outside the rc):  (32)   ima -ya domu nari       -te   Icotaimi — kitane

         'You all, come to see the bird that flies at night'
  In (32), the rc imaya narite kotai 'that flies at night'  is
split   by domu 'bird', the domain N. Thus, the RC iroaya domu
narite kotai 'the bird that flies at night' is clearly of  the
internal class.    In Waraa, subject and abject nouns may : be
relativized. The relativizer item is kotai 'REL'.","[48, 49]"
"      Given   its peculiarities, DIHIBU ’words of       giving
explanations'  as a speech act sets down a specific style.   I
have called it the DERI STYLE 'council style'. The passages of
talk in the DERI STYLE offer very interesting saciolinguistic
data for the three following reasons: (i3 participants focus
on just one topic in most of the cases offering explanations
of actions that depict a problem and identify individuals
playing parts in it. This sort of explanations contain varied
                                130
  phonological, morphosyntactic , and lexical forms that make
  possible to compare manners of saying and behaving. The DERI
  STYLE! closely associates with direct speech, the manner of
  speech nowadays ; considered the keystone for understanding
  dxscoursive sequences and their socio-cultural      meaning and
  inip1ications, Cii) language is used not only for transmitting
; expressions and discussing actions, but it itself represents
  actions    since   every   participant— using   all     possible
, resources— attempts to convince the others of accepting his
 point .of view., One of the major efforts in this respect should
  be .made by the airamotuma 'chiefs' whose fundamental role is
 the -finding; of a solution' to each problem,     for instance,
  persuading the protagonists of an impasse to change the
 attitude of one towards the other and viceversa.         In this
  sense, - the DERI STYLE is a source of data for studying
 performativity’ (Brimes,    1975), and   (iii) contents reveal
 linguistic     usages   that allows to explore degrees        of
 proficiency and personal attitudes of the Warao towards the
 Warao language. The passages of talk in the DERI STYLE offered
 by participants, independently from statuses, point out the
.relevance, of such conceptual relations as those shown in
  (323> belriw        (36) obonobo ===> dibu ===> yanoko ===> yakerata
             think        say       listen      solve
             (Briggs, 198B)   '    Several notes of morpho—syntactic value about Warao by
Barr si   (195B) have been included in ethnographies, grammars
and dictionaries in the absence of an analysis of styles in
this language. As a result, some of the remarks by Barra! lack
justifications,    and in the case of other       authors their
appreciations are not convincent. For instance, Barral     (195B)
mentions     that ""occultism""— or what he personally        calls
 ""literary camouflage""— is an outstanding quality of the speech
of the airamotuma 'chiefs' and wisiratu 'shamans'. Barral adds
that the airamotuma and wisiratu try to create a sort of
mysterious environment around them to reach the goal to put
intentionally a belief into any Warao's mind, and since the
Warao are candid, as he says, the use of language showing
uncommon     arrangements   and   realisations   of    difficult
interpretation becomes an instrument f a r     such a purpose.
Socially,    Barral's judgement may be true, but from           a
linguistic perspective, his explanation is insufficient.         I
have found that what seems to be simply ""literary camouflage""
represents indeed manifestations of stylistically-motivated
syntactic    patterns and lexicon.    For instance,     suffixal
pronouns, and morphological causatives of di—transitive verbs
are typical in the DERI STYLE, and some of these structures
are variants of other structures commonly used in everyday
language. It appears to be that the emphatic value of suffixal
pronouns as opposed to the semantic effect of prefixal ones
arid   the    possibilities   of   language   enrichment     that
morphological di—transitive causatives bring about as compared
with other causatives are important tools in discoursive
                              131
sequences related to DIHIBU.","[137, 138, 139]"

bilingual in Warao and         Spanish to varying degrees. Rather

these ’are the most remote 'and difficult to reach, located next

  10.2. Hypotaxis (Embedding)
  In Warao, there are also hypotactical complex constructions
involving verb suffixes associated with aspect/tense Ias
markers of such hypotactical relation, which is commonplace,in
verb-final languages. Besides, the linkage between the higher
clause and the embedded one may be expressed by means of
clause-initial free items, often postpositions, in the manner
of complementizers. To account for embedding, such a process
in non-finite clauses is examined first; then, the one in
finite clauses is examined.",[25]

expressing temporality. Of course, the Warao system ! is

mathematical parameters inherent: to clock and calendar time
divisions, j:.The parameters used by the Warao to measure time
correlate wi th the movement*.; of the sun, the moon and some

•flood, and the tidal fluctuations of the water levels in the
Orinoco Dellta. ,                 ;j-   The basic time expressions in Waraa can be grouped into   (i)

     24.4.2. Month and the passing of months
  The term used for referring to the moon, waniku Cwani
'hide', eku 'inside'= the one that hides inside itself], is
extended in a temporal sense to the month. The passing of the
moon through its four phases, which covers a 2B day-period,
represents   in   terms   of extension    the   nation   under
consideration.  As well, the occurrence of the moon phases
marks time paints used as reference for activities performed
by the'Warao. A summary of the time adverbs related to months
and month divisions is offered in TABLE 16:

                                                             i  Reference to years involves the seasonal behavior of, the
canos of the Orinoco Delta. The phrase ho ira literaly means
'water rise’, which is an adequate reference for the annual
big flood of the Orinoco, an event that is crucially—important
for the survival of the Warao. The dietary habits of the Warao
depend of the rising of the waters, when they gather crabs,
catch some nutritious seasonal fish, grow some kinds of edible
roots, and so on. It is common to hear among the Warao,
statements as the following one:                         ?
                                                         t  (217)   ho    ira mi -kore motana     saba naru —kotu     .

   ho ira ’big flood’ is the departing point to set up (one-
year— long periods, which is logically the lapse stretching
between two floods. Age is determined on the basis of' the
number of floods that have passed from the day of birth^, or
arrival, or making, etc. For example                    j

          I   big flood Warao one    COP
          ’I am 20 years old’  ho ira also means ’rainy season’. It has to be taken f into
account that the overflow of the Orinoco river andf the
equatorial heavy rains coincide, reaching their peaks in
August, ho ira ’rainy season’ opposes to ina waha (lit.) ,’soil
dryness’ or ’dry season’. Both seasonal terms may be used, for
marking paints within a year period. For example:         i

functioning as adverbials which are used exclusively in pieces
of mythological narratives. Such time items usually describe
the state of affairs in a legend emphasizing on any particular

periphrases.  Some of them (at least, those that are recorded
in my data) are listed in TABLE IB;

  All cardinals bring about corresponding distributives of the
kind    exemplified  in  (135). Further,    a   sub-class   of
distributives is exclusively expressed as a postpositional
phrase containing cardinals introduced by tane, which can be
roughly‘glossed as English ’times’, tane ’times’ postposed to
any figure indicates the number of times an action occurs. For
example: :(136) isaka.tane   hobi —nu  *
        one   times drink 2sg.IMP
 '      ’Drink (it) once’
 f(T37) dihanaiao tane yatu hobi —ki —tia
        three     time you drink INT HAB
      ’ ’You are going to drink (it) three times as usual'  Distributives as the exemplified above always have adverbial
function.","[62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"

 : 20. DETERMINERS
 ' 20.T. Demonstrative determiners
  This is a class of three members which shares with nouns the
suffixation of the number marker -tuma 'PL'. The paradigm of
Warao demonstrative determiners is presented in TABLE 3 below               PROXIMAL              SINGULAR                PLURAL              tama      'this'        tama —tuma ’these'               DISTAL              SINGULAR                PLURAL              ta(i) 'that'            ta -tuma    'those'
              ama   ’that yonder'     ama -tuma   'those yonder
           TABLE 3: Demonstrative determiners  The items in TABLE 3 are part of a small set of definite
determiners, which locate their heads with respect to the
deictic center of the speech situation in at least three
degrees of distance.    Such demonstrative determiners     may
indistinctly precede or follow head nouns within noun phrases,
though postceding seems to be most widely spread:
  (112) a. noboto -ma ta    -tuma
           child   PL that PL
*          ’Those children'
                                 51
         b. ta -tuma nobotD —ma
            that PL   child  PL
            'Those children’
 20.2.   Interrogative and indefinite determiners
  As in a number of Amazonian languages, WaraD has a small set
of determiners which show two major uses:      indefinite I and
interrogative. These are                                  !                a. sina     'who/some/any'               b. kasi kaha 'what/some/any’
            TABLE 4: Interrogative   and   indefinite
                     determiners  The two major senses for each determiner are linked, iWhat
the determiners indicate is that the identity of an entity is
not known to the speaker. The interrogative sense may be
engendered, depending on content although it may be morpholo­
gically instantiated by the verb suffix —ra 'INTERROG'.  These
process is exemplified in (113)                          I
        INTERROGATIVE                                    i
  (113) warao —tuma sina yaota rubuhi —te     —ra
        Warao PL    who work hurry     NON-PAST INTERROG !
        ‘Who Warao will hurry their work?'               i
  (114) ama a hakohi kasikaha eku yatu
        (to)day      what     in you         naru —te     —ra
         go    NON-PAST INTERROG
         'In what day will ou go?'","[58, 59]"
"  To explain staging in Warao, focusing must be brought again
into discussion. I have already mentioned that new information
in Warao tends to appear in sentence initial position,   which

•focuses it. Since the sentence ^initial positioning of new
information in- the language is implemented by the FOCUS
FRONTilNB: RULE, such a rule, for example, fronts the oblique
hanokosebe teku'va 'in(to) the "";vi1 lage’ in (70b). In (71c), the
FOCUSINB,., RULE jfrants the subject .waraa isaka ‘one Warao’ in a
way -similar to that in which the rule operates upon the
oblique in (70b). The moving of other sentential       constituents
in j (70b) and (71c) may be considered a consequence of the
operation of the'FOCUSINB RULE'to front those constituents
representing new information,' i.e. hanokosebe ekuva and warao
i saka. which are now ""centered on the stage""              (Brimes,
1975: 325) . i-The relocation of ithe abliques kasiri aisiko   ‘with
kasiri” in (70b) and ho muhoko ‘on the side of the river’ in
 (71c) ——both representing packages of old information— depends
upqn the speaker’s consideration of them as secondary or
Unimportant enoug h a s to be siderstaged or placed far from the
center ;of ;the .stage occupied ,by the new information or focus.","[43, 44]"
"
  There is an alternative mechanism to question constituents
within embedded clauses in complex sentences. This implies the
use ;of sina 'who' and/or kasi kaha ’what’ preceding the
embedded clause provided that the main clause is left out, in
a treatment identical with echo questions. Such a treatment is
by thejWay:of illustration applied to (46), as shown in (47)  (47) a. sina —ra       hi      ribu nona —naka —kore 0
          who   INTERROG 2sg.F'OS say do     NEG   COND
          ’If who do not do as he (the chief) says?’
          b. kasikaha —ra       yatu nona —naka —kore
             what      INTERROG,you do     NEG   COND
             ’If you do not do what?’  s   ""
  Since the interrogative marker —ra ’INTERROG' only attaches
to main verbs, which in this particular context is absent, the
question-word themselves suffix them. This is a commonplace
procedure in Warao, more likely to take place in copulative
sentences in which the copula may be omitted, such as
exemplified in (44f).",[32]

  As in most languages, the introduction of new characters in
Warao discourse often brings about supplementary information
concerning them, which serve identifying       (and modifying)
functions:

        Anthropologists working on South America have drawn attention
        to the notion of ""social space"", that is SPACE conceived as
        relevant to society. Brahaoi (1986) studied the usage of three
        styles;    ritual wailing, communal singing and        political
        oratory.   She observed that the styles tends to be associated
        exclusively with distinct parts of the Xavante social space.
        Xavante villages are organized into a semicircle of houses
        around a central plaza. Graham       (1986) noted that ritual
        wailing occurred almost exclusively around the hut, whereas
        political oratory was associated with the plaza, the area
        where the meetings of the men's council occurred. Communal
        singing was in this regard intermediate, taking place in the
        plaza, but also between the plaza and the hut as groups of men
        marched around the village singing.

  (ii)    TIME. Time is a very -frequent co—determinant of usage.
One example of this is discussed by Urban (1987) along the
following lines: in Shakleng, the origin of myth-telling, dr
ceremonial dialogue style, known as the waneklen. and the ■
dyadic chanting style known as the ahan are closely related in
structure-independent     forms,    differing     markedly;  in
structure—dependent aspects. The former style is associated i>
with these rituals for the dead, and it is in this measure
temporally—bound. The latter style occurs at the lip—plug
giving and thigh—tabooing ceremony for 1— to 3—year— old
children.   It only takes place in the latter temporallyj-bound ,
context.  (iii)     PERSON.  A basic distinction, Urban   (1987) notices,
among personal determinants of style has to do with their
relational as opposed to non-relational character. The ! style
may be determined more in terms of the person who is speaking,
regardless of the interlocutor or other aspects of the
context, or mare in terms of the relationship            between
speaker(s)     and   hearer(s).   Among   the    non-relational
determinants are such basic oppositions as that between,; male
and female.    In some cases, there may be full of structural
differences    between men's and women's      speech.    Another
non-relational contrasts involves age, especially, differences
between elder and younger speech.                         j         A relational determinant is style variation depending
upon the kinship relation between speaker and hearer. In; some
Central Brazil    languages, affinal relationships demand a E
formality in interaction which includes linguistic styles.      i.

    (iv)     RFERENTIAL CONTENT. This refers to the content or
subject matter of the discourse which may be associated with ,
stylistic distinctiveness.    In general, style determined by
content is usually referred to as ""genre"". Urban (19B7) i notes
that there are many formal features that          differentiate |‘
myth-telling from other instances of language use, and that j
differentiate one type of myth—tel1ing, that dealing' with
traditional stories, from another, that dealing with the
origin myth. In the case of Shakleng, Urban paints out, , these i-
are mainly lexical and syntactic; however, in other Amazonian |.
languages they may be basically phonological.            j
  30. WARAQ SPEECH ACTS AND ASSOCIATED DISCOUSE FEATURES
  To accomplish the goal of describing different speech !styles
which characterize by particular morpho—syntactic and lexical
usages determined— on a spatial—temporal framework— by the ■
person who is speaking, kinship ties or social relationships o
between speakers and hearers and referential contents or |(
subject matters into consideration, it is necessary to (typify
speech acts and clasify the discourse features prevailing in
such types. Only after this step has been completed, styles or ;

  10.2.1. Nan—finite clauses
  10.2.1.1. Nominal   (infinitival) clauses
  Some nominal constructions derived from underlying verbs
constitute the nearest equivalent to noun clauses. In Warao,
these   are exclusively infinitival, and they       serve   as
complements of verbs. When a verbal complement has the same
subject as the main clause, this is nominalized with the
suffix -kitane 'INFINIT' and placed next to the main verb thus
disrupting the sequence of constituents of the main clause.
Infinitival clauses tend to be rather short, mostly occurring
as objects. Borne examples are offered in (30-31)
  (30) tukubita —ya tai hiaka
       Tucupita ALL he garment       nisa —kitane naru -na —te
       buy   INFINIT go    sg NON-PAST
       'He/she goes to Tucupita to buy garments'
  (31) ine ure     buha    -kitane     nao -a   -e
       I   malanga dig out INFINIT     come PUNC PAST
       'I came to dig out malanga'
  In (30), for instance, hiaka nisakitane 'to buy garments’ is                                18
an !infinitival clause in the rale of object complement
embedded! in the main verb narunate ’g o ’* thus breaking into
two halves the main clause tukubitava tai narunate 'He/she
goes; ,tos Tucupita’. Analogous behavior is observed between the
infinitival; clause ure buhakitane 'to dig out malanga'      and
the,main clause ine naonae 'I came' in (31).","[25, 26]"

participants in any syntactic role can be questioned.      For
example, (44a) and (44e) question subjects. (44b) questionsan
indirect   object and    (44c) questions an oblique.     (44d)
questions a direct object. (44f) and       (44g) question the
complement of the copula. Even, some elemets of a complex
quotative sentence may be questioned. For example, (6b) cited
above makes possible questions such as those in (45)  (45) a. sina tira wab —a  —e   tatuma
          who woman die PUNC PAST 3pl.□          ribu -n —a   —e   -ra

          'What did the young girl say to them?’  Nevertheless,   other complex sentence types, in    which
embedding often causes main clauses to split, for instance,
the conditional sentence in (46) below  (46) airamo hi-     ribu yatu nona —naka -kore

                              24
   tend to avoid question-word questioning within the embedded
clause.  In this regard, no instance of questioned embedded
clause constituent by using question—words appears in the
Collected data. In addition to that fact, all the hypothetical
examples 'presented    to the informants      were  considered
ungrammatical.1  It is likely that the fronting of         the
questioned1constituent inherent to question-words brings about
syntactic complications that act as deterrant. Quotatives seem
to escape this restriction because the embedded clause, i.e.
the quote, precedes the entire main clause, which makes the
former behave as any initial object that needs not be further
moved from;its original position.","[30, 31, 32]"

                         CONCLUSIONS
   (1) The data provided by Marao and the descriptive analysis
here offered is expected to have broadened the data base
available to linguistic science for purposes of formulating
substantive    and   formal universale an     human   language,
particularly in areas of current theoretical interest s u c h ; as
the determination of basic constituent order, Waran has proven
to be a predominantly object initial language within a very
steady verb final sentential      pattern, which favors       iOSV
arrangement in simplex sentences. Although subjects in Warao
appear    to be erratic constituents often,       fronted     for
highlighting purposes, they may be adjacent to verbs, behavior
which works in support of its classification as a prototypical
CSV language.","[139, 140, 141]"

  5. TRANSCRIPTION AND MORPHOPHONEMICS                         j
  The following conventions are observed in presenting ! my
Warao examples. Three lines of information appear with most
examples    in the body of the paper:       ii)    a    morphemic
representation giving the underlying     forms    of    all     the
morphemes    and  the   boundaries between      them,     Cii) ' a
morpheme—by—morpheme English gloss, and (iii) an appropriate,
rather    free,  English translation.    In this     system , of
representation,   common recurring    morphemes      are     given
abbreviated glasses indicated in uppei— case letters. A list- of
these abbreviations is found in the introductory pages of this
research. It must be emphasized that the morpheme glosses are
intended for helping the reader to understand the structure or
usage, either in isolation or contextually.         It is worth
mentioning as well that when examples are intended for
presenting the referential content that characterizes some
styles, the morpheme-by-morpheme English glosses are avoided,
and an almost literal translation is included.                  |                                4

" ■ The term PAST is obvious enough since it means ""anterior to
the    moment : of   speaking"",  or ""looked    back   on"",   or
""recollected”, or ""recalled” from the moment of speaking.   The
term,: WON-PAST makes sense in terms of the semantic potential
of the tense category in Warao, a language which besides
referring to past and recalled events, with equal ease refers
to current or subsequent ones. i“ ■       .i■

 ! Time previous to time of speaking is indicated by means of
two .suffixes: (i)    which is completive and correlates with
the perfective aspect, and      (ii) ^e. which runs with the
imperfective aspect, and it is inherently punctual:     ’PAST’
and —n(a) ’PUNC’ always cluster. Further distinctions such as
proximity and remoteness are expressed externally,       i.e.,
outside the verb inflectional system, by means of time adverbs
and constructions indicating location in time.   Examples are
provided all throughout this research.",[102]
"   (3) This sociolinguistic sketch of Warao incorporates this
language to the very reduced set of Amazonian languages that
have been looked into upon an adequate theoretical framework.
Many existing analyses written at the turn of the century have
described native languages against a Latin-based grammatical
background.    Despite  increased contributions    about   the
functioning of native languages developed during the past
twenty   years, the Amazon—Orinoco axis still remains        a
linguistic    reservoir about which very little has       been
investigated.   In this particular linguistic context, some
studies of strict phonological, morpho-syntactic and lexical
scope have been completed. Nevertheless, little attention has
been paid to language and society interaction.   Native South
American languages very often offer different patterns and
alternative    forms rooted in societal traits.      In  these
languages, perhaps more than in any others, the property of
variation in languages becomes remarkably significant. I have
found for Warao oral performances that the diverse forms of
stylistic differentiation are intimately linked to social
organization— interacting actively and each one supporting the                               134
other.   In   the   Waraa case, the     study   of   styi isti c
differentiation demands considerations about customs beliefs,
political order,   kinship, alliance, etc-, as well as about
more restricted social circles within society.","[141, 142]"

  DAT is used to express several different meanings.   Animate i
nouns take DAT to indicate beneficiary, in particular, within
the indirect object of verbs of giving, as in (84)  (84) dima -si raukuaha tai kona -te
       father DAT fruit    he bring NON-PAST
       'He brings fruit for his father'                     ;  Further, DAT can perform a temporal function        adding     a
special time reference to nouns. For example:
  (85) haira       -ma warao -tuma yaro -te                 ■
       rainy season DAT Warao PL    return NON-PAST
       'The Warao will return for the rainy season (they    will
       spend their time in the village then)’
  LOG serves as a general marker     of   static   location,|   as
illustrated in (86)
  (86) dima -no ha
       father LOC COP
       'He/she is at his/her father's place'
  Co-occuring with telic motion verbs,     it can also mark
movement towards.   The use of LOC in the latter sense,, as
opposed to ALL, carries an additional implication that , the
goal would be reached in the course of motion, for example:
  (87) bare     a hanoko —ira —no ine naru —te
       father   of house   AUG   LOC I   go    NON—PAST
       (priest)
       'I go to the mission house (the speaker is approaching
       the place as he speaks'  ALL is used to denote movement towards a place in a locative
sense.  Additionally, verbs of perception assign ALL to the
object of perception. Both cases are respectively exemplified
in (88) and (89)
  (88) hanoko —ya rieko naru —te
       house   ALL Diego go    NON—PAST
       'Diego goes to his house'  (89) dau —era. —ya oko mi —a   -e

Warao questions.",[30]
"  On the other hand, the unintentional aspect marker — ka
’UNINT'  attracts the past tense marker ^e 'PAST' to mean the
unintended effects (often occurred accidentally)   of already
passed events:  (26B) wahibaka isiko wanari — ka   -n -a   -e

    26. 1.2i 2. 2.4. Punctual/semelfactive aspect
 . The -form for punctuality,   'RUNG’, as a rule, denotes a
short- duration of an action.        ’RUNG'  has semelfactive
overtones suggesting an action done in one attempt    (it may
also., be] explained as expressing lack of iteration). The
punctual| aspect easily occurs with motion verbs or verbs
implyingjmovement. With such verbs,    'RUNG' is figuratively
understood as,instantaneous. Punctual aspect is used with past
and non-past time reference:
 j     ‘ PUNCTUAL PAST       M    |

 ;    , ... ’My mother cut the bush with a single blow’   26.1.2.2.2.5.   Iterative/usitative/frequentative aspects  There is a highly variable interpretation for the verb
morphology which indicates iteration or ’repetition a second
time or more’. Such iteration is expressed in the language by
means of the aspectual suffix —bu ’ITER’. For example:          GENERIC
    (272) tai boro      —bu —te
          He punch holes ITER NON-PAST
          ’He punches holes (to extract palm heart) repeatedly’   (272) could imply some additional information, such as the
following; ’he punches many holes many times’, or ’he punches
just one hole many times, deepening it’, or ’he punches many
holes one time each’, and even other interpretations. Thus, it
might be said that —bu ’ITER’ is a quite generic iterative
marker whose meaning must be precise contextually.","[105, 106]"
"  However, -vama 'BY HSY' is used in association with ( the
periphrastic    legendary   past advebials of the language,
within narratives handed down for generations. Thus, as it
might be expected, —vama 'BY HSY' has a restricted usage 1 and
it is very seldom,     if ever, heard in everyday speech.
Independently from these last considerations, —vama 'BY HSY’'
is a significant indicator that the speaker is transmitting
someone   else’s comments, which is a      manifestation l of
indirection.                                             ;
  14.   REFLEXIVES/RECIPROCALS                             j

reciprocals.  Reflexivity is expressed exclusively byj the

 behavior o f ; the listeners which is almost totally passive,
remaining in silence all over the delivering. In this case,
 listeners' - participations— “if      any— generally       confine
 themselves to collective laughing as a response to stimuli of
 comic nature;    !

       Another speech act that has been detected— called
DIHIBU 'words of giving explanations'— covers discussions
intended for solving communal problems, particularly those
which have caused physical and verbal violence or any other
kind of disagreement among the Warao of a village. !The
contextual situation for DIHIBU is somewhat defined by ithe
time, space, person and referential content parameters, i A
DIHIBU session meets at night in the place of any community
leader, whether this is the home of the kobenahoro 'governor',
or   any airamp 'chief'— the bisi kari     'fiscal',  kabitano
'captain'   or borisia 'policeman'. The confronting parties
together with relatives and friends show up at the meeting
place where the kobenahoro and other chiefs might have
convened, and one by one expresses points of view about the
matter. They may be questioned to clarify doubts.         Once
argumentations    have been evaluated,    one of the    chiefs
interprets what has happened and makes a point on what the
consequences of such deeds may be or might have been. Finally,
he encourages the ceasing of hostilities and the restoration
of harmony between the upset men, groups or families. ;The
chief emphasizes in the need of sticking to peaceful solutions
such as the ancestors always did. The chiefs’ pieces of advice
seldom generate reactions other than those leading to a
settlement;   nonetheless, the participants in DIHIBU meetings
may go on in the discussion of the problem for several hours
to adjust the terms of the arrangement. My data suggests that
consensus is obtained very quickly when the chief is a
skillful orator.    In egalitarian societies like the Warao,
leading statuses correlate with ability to preserve good
interpersonal    relations in groups and communities.      The
opposite condition— current alteration of social order :and
delay to bring it back— means leadership weakening, and often
this triggers the renewal of community heads.","[128, 129]"
