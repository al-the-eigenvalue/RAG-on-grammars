of their clause. These words are postposed particles which follow the word or phrase in their
scope. The examples here are organized by the syntactic role in the scope of 'only'.","[725, 726]"
"                                  31.1. Simple negationThe negative morpheme is either a suffix or a proclitic particle depending on the verb's
inflectional form: suffix for tense forms, proclitic cy for converbs and nonfinites, proclitic my
for imperatives. (For the negative suffixal forms see §13.12.) There is also the stylistic
option of emphatic negation, marked with a non-clitic word: see §31.6.)            In (1)-(2) the
negative morpheme is hyphenated off for visibility, though the exact morpheme boundary is
not always discrete.",[716]
"
                      31.2. Indefinites in the scope of negationThere is no double or multiple negation in Ingush, with the possible exception of the two
specialized adverbs c'aqqa='a 'never; (not) … ever' and cq'ea-cq'a 'not once'. In origin these
are indefinites specialized for use in negative contexts; they contain no formal marking of
negation. Apart from these, ordinary indefinites ('someone', 'something', etc.) are used with a
negative verb, often taking focus gemination or the clitic ='a but otherwise bearing no formal
696                                    Ingush Grammar
indication that they are in the scope of negation. The ordinary indefinites sag 'someone' (lit.
'person') and hama 'something' (lit. 'thing'), when in the scope of negation, have phrasal
accent if they are in the nominative case, and they can be preceded by indefinite cwa 'one' or
an emphatic indefinite (with focus gemination and optional focus particle) cwaaqqa or
cwaaqqa='a 'any'. Another form in the oblique cases is cwannie='a 'someone' (nominalized
form of 'one' plus particle). The distinctive forms are found only in the nominative; in oblique
cases, ordinary indefinite forms are used (sometimes with the focus particle).
     Partial case paradigms of the most common indefinite forms:        'someone;          'no one'                   'something;        'nothing'
        no one'                                       nothing'

ERG     cwan saguo         cwannie='a                 (not attested)In the following examples each of the successive primary phrasal accents is lower in pitch
than the preceding due to normal declination. After a high-accent nominative indefinite, an
element that would ordinarily bear high accent (such as bwarjga in (20), where it is the first
element of a compound) has low accent. The high tone associated with the negative suffix on
the verb sounds like primary stress with high accent and may well be so parsed. Its pitch is
lower than that of ság due to declination.","[718, 719]"

                                       NEGATION
Negation is formally marked only on the verb in Ingush, regardless of its semantic scope.
(There is one exception to this statement: the negative participial forms discussed at the end
of §31.1.) The word in the scope of negation can sometimes be identified by particles and
prosody, but often there is no formal marking of scope.","[715, 716]"

            INFLECTIONAL CATEGORIES OF THE VERB
                                       13.0. Introduction     Ingush has a large number of tenses and moods which combine with aktionsart and
pluractionality categories (Chapter 14) to create a very rich system of tense-aspect-mood
distinctions. This chapter describes the forms and meanings of the TAM categories.
Appendix 1 includes full inflectional tables for two simplex verbs. Tables 12-1 and 12-2 in
Chapter 12 show the main forms for one verb of each conjugation class.
     Ingush has tenses that I have labeled narrative past and narrative pluperfect because they
are used primarily in narrative. Speakers also use a narrative present discourse strategy,
which involves shifting some tenses to present and some simulfactives to pluractional. Since
this is a discourse strategy for the use of tenses rather than a distinct tense or set of tenses, it is
described in Chapter 33 on discourse (§33. 4).
     Ingush is notably sensitive to evidentiality, and speakers generally comment on the
evidentiality rather than on the aspect or tense when asked to explain the meaning of a tense.
I have tried to label tenses based on the most salient meanings, so the tense that might have
been called aorist is termed witnessed past here and what might have been called perfect is
termed nonwitnessed.","[264, 265, 266]"
"                                      13.12. Negation     Indicative finite verbs are negated suffixally. For simple tenses built on the present stem,
the suffix -(â)c is added to the infinitive stem, followed by any tense suffix. For tenses built
on the past stem, -(â)ndz- is added to the infinitive stem, followed by any tense suffix.
Colloquially, and among younger speakers, the past stem is used: normative tuoxandzar
'didn't strike', colloquial tiexandzar (infinitive stem tuox-, past tiex-); normative dieshandzar
'didn't read', colloquial diishandzar (infinitive stem d.iesh-, past d.iish-); normative aalandzar
'didn't say', colloquial ealandzar (infinitive stem aal-, past eal-). In analytic tenses only the
auxiliary appears in its negative form. Plain 'be' has irregular ablaut in its negative forms, as
do most irregular verbs. The negative suffixes have high tone (§4.2), which falls on the
preceding vowel stem vowel or epenthetic schwa.",[331]
"5.6.1. Clitics. Clitic coordinating and chaining conjunctions: ='a, =ji 'and' (Chapter 24).
Both have high tone which spreads to the preceding syllable, and the vowel of the conjunction
itself is a schwa which undergoes elision (§§2.5.1, 3.2.2).
      Focus and attenuative focus clitic particles: =m, =q. These are special clitics which are
positioned relative to particular words: =m follows the word in focus, and =q immediately
follows the inflected verb. It is difficult to prove that they are clitics, since they lack vowels
and therefore cannot show clitic vocalism. They are unlike affixes in that they begin with
consonants but never take an epenthetic vowel. In Ingush orthography they are written with a
hyphen, i.e. not as affixes.
      Negative proclitics indicative cy= and imperative (prohibitive) my= (Chapter 31). These
have high tone which does not spread as their vowels are never elided.
      The emphatic proclitic my (§§16.2.1, 32.4.2, 33.2.1), segmentally homophonous to the
prohibitive negative but without high tone.
120                                      Ingush Grammar
    Interrogative =ii (after consonant), =i (after vowel). This particle is enclitic to verbs. It
has high tone which does not spread as the vowel of the particle is never elided. See Chapter
32 for examples.
    Phrase-initial qy 'another, more, else; (not) any more'. Unaccented and probably
proclitic, most often preposed to the first word in the phrase; it can host clitics: qy=t'y
'moreover, besides', qy='a 'another, more, else'.","[142, 143]"
"     The schematic diagram of intonation in (56) shows that an indefinite modifier and the
indefinite word it modifies each have phrasal accent. The high pitch on the syllable before
='a, the high pitch on the word in the scope of negation (here, sag), and the high pitch on the
syllable before the negative -ndz- are all high, but declination lowers each successive one.",[723]
"    High tone is not an automatic property of certain morpheme classes. The witnessed past
negative carries it while the negative past participle does not:54(31)   qeikandza 'uninvited'                        (cf. qeikândzar 'didn't invite')The procitic negative (prohibitive) my has high tone while the segmentally homophonous
proclitic emphatic particle does not:54
     The tonal difference between the two negative morphemes is interesting, as the morphemes
themselves are cognate. The Proto-Nakh morpheme was *c(V). In the witnessed past tense this *c
has been voiced after /n/, which is the only remnant in Ingush of the ancient Nakh recent past tense
suffix *-in (which survives in Batsbi and marginally in Chechen). (For voicing of *c after /n/ cf.
Chechen hinca, Ing. handz ‘now’.) This recent past suffix has high pitch in Batsbi (in my own
field notes) cognate to the high tone in the Ingush nonwitnessed and witnessed past suffixes.

"(Such examples have declination: see §4.4.)
     The declination over IP's with high and low accents give Ingush prosody a distinctive
declining sawtooth or stairstep contour.

                                          4.2. Tone     Ingush has a minimal tone system which is interesting precisely for being so minimal and
yet so clearly a tone system.53 The Ingush tone system has correspondents in the other two
Nakh languages Chechen and Batsbi, though the Batsbi system is one of mobile stress
apparently without separate phonemic tone. Several languages of the Daghestanian branch of
Nakh-Daghestanian have been described as having tone (Kodzasov 1990), but tones have not
been reported in the descriptions of Daghestanian languages available in English and their
presence in Daghestan is not well known outside of Russia. The Ingush system, though
minimal, is of the same general type as the Daghestanian systems, supporting Kodzasov's
analysis.
     In Ingush a handful of morphemes (all of them grammatical formatives) carry a tone
realized as high or rise-fall on the tone-bearing morpheme or (if it is enclitic) on the preceding
syllable (even if that is an epenthetic schwa). See §2.9 for spectrograms. Historically, this
tone may have been non-initial stress; but now stress in Ingush is almost invariably word-
initial (and non-initial stress, in the few words that have it as described in §4.1.1, is not
phonetically identical to high tone).
     The tone-bearing morphemes of Ingush are:     Proclitics
       cy=                  Negative (converb)
       my=                  Negative (imperative)     Suffixes

   I believe the first description of a Nakh language as having tone is Nichols 1998 (an earlier
version of this section). Komen 2007 describes tone for two Chechen clitics cognate to identically
toned Ingush ones.

                             14.1. Singular and plural verbs     A few verbs undergo stem changes in agreement with the number of the S/O. The 23
known pairs are shown in Table 14-1. The main formations are suppletion, ablaut of stem
vowel, and change of stem-final -ll- to -xk-. Only simple stems are given here (some are
attested mostly with prefixes). Two plurals correspond to ull 'lie': d.aada (progressive, most
often with animate subject) and uxk (stative, often with inanimate subject). The two forms
corresponding to xou 'sit' are variants; some speakers prefer one, some the other. This
singular/plural distinction could be viewed as either a lexical category or a partial derivational
category.
     The plural agrees with the morphological number of a noun or pronoun and not with the
sense of the NP. Thus plural nouns take plural verbs but a numeral phrase takes a singular
verb as it has a singular head noun.","[333, 334, 335, 336]"

indicating a past event with present results when the speaker has not witnessed the event. The
aspect is perfective: the event has occurred and the result is in force, so the endpoint of telic,
punctual, and ingressive aktionsart is realized. This tense can be used in ordinary narrative
where the speaker did not see the event but sees (or has seen) the result and infers the event,
but it can also be used where the speaker has not seen the result and is not inferring anything.
It is the usual tense for narration of legends, myths, folktales, jokes, stories heard from others,
and the like, and also the usual tense of proverbs. Thus the basic meaning can be described as
a perfective event with a result, where the speaker has not necessarily witnessed the event.
To Ingush speakers, the most salient meaning seems to be the fact that the speaker did not
witness the event, and this is usually the only property mentioned by language consultants.
However, the verb occurs with good frequency in the first person singular, where it naturally
indicates events which the speaker has witnessed and/or performed, so the meaning that is
salient to speakers is not the only meaning of this form.
      An example of narrative in the nonwitnessed tense is this passage set in the middle ages.",[278]
"                              12.2. Regular verb classes107     Verbs have almost no lexically conditioned differences of inflectional endings, but
regular verbs fall into 16 ablaut classes. A representative verb of each class is shown in Table
12-1 and the negative forms in Table 12-2. There are three ablaut grades or stem forms: the
infinitive stem (used in infinitive, verbal noun, and negative forms), the present stem (used in
present, imperfect, and future tenses and converbs), and the past stem (used in the witnessed
past and nonwitnessed tenses, the pluperfect, and anterior converbs).",[260]
"180
    The finite non-negative form of the verb would be toajeai (repair-J.CS.NW.J), with cliticized
tense auxiliary =jy (§13.3.1) reduced to [-j]. Here joacandea is the negative anterior converb of
that tense auxiliary. With an auxiliary this long the verb is usually written as two words: toajea
joacandea (and not toajeajoacandea).

      uninvited came back without [any dog food: desh D 'gruel for dogs'] having been
      poured.)(126) has a manner clause similar to a depictive:(126) ghaalmaqa  chei yshtta luusazh  laattar,

distinct from adjunct phrases and clauses. Elicited examples often contain focus gemination
or a focus particle. In (127) the focus gemination and prosody are crucial to interpreting
'clean' as a resultative; otherwise it is understood as an attributive adjective as in (128).",[644]
"13.0.2. Idiosyncratic tenses. There are two verbs 'be': neutral d.y (an irregular verb) and
delimited xul (regular). Their forms were shown in Table 12-3. Both verbs function as
lexical verbs and also provide TAM auxiliaries. Neutral 'be' has a defective stem paradigm
with only a present stem and the forms based on it. It has a plain past tense, which no other
verb has; all other verbs have imperfect, witnessed past, and others which neutral 'be' lacks. It
also has a synthetic negative simultaneous converb d.oacazh and a synthetic negative
interrogative d.iec=ii. All other verbs have analytic forms here.",[267]

of delimited 'be'. Forms whose meaning has to do with inference of a progressive action can
be elicited but are rare in texts, and consultants differ as to their exact meaning. A text
example is the last clause of §35.5 (sentence (110)). Elicited forms are:(156) molazh           xanna      xannuu

imperative is identical to the infinitive (though their negative forms are different: the
infinitive takes cy= and the imperative my=). Meaning: Default imperative form, used
whenever there is no specific addressee and when the pragmatics of the mild and future
imperatives do not apply: writer's comments to reader; orders and commands; sudden
warnings; etc. The addressee is expected to comply (or at least react) immediately.",[297]
"       The following pair shows how dwa- can imply an undesirable situation and add
negative connotations:(94)   Hwo Ahwmadaa bwara+hwazharii?
       2s Ahmed.DAT eye+look.WP=Q
       Have you seen Ahmed lately? Have you looked at Ahmed? (The question implies that
       Ahmed has changed greatly, or more generally that the speaker wonders whether the
       hearer has noticed Ahmed's appearance.)(95)   Hwo Ahwmadaa dwa-bwara+hwazharii?

       Did you look at (that ugly bastard) Ahmed? (Did you see what an ugly face that
       Ahmed has?) 137     In all three of these patterns the deictic slot is lexicalized, though in different ways. In
person-based and displaced deixis (§§15.5.1.1, 15.5.1.2) illustrated just above, what is usually
lexicalized is not one or the other deictic prefix but the pair of them, with the choice of hwa-
vs. dwa- in a particular example based on true or displaced deixis relative to clause
participants. With metaphorical deixis, either hwa- or dwa- is lexicalized as basic (and there
may be further alternation following person-based or displaced deixis).",[375]

    High tone transferred to the second syllable of aara from the following clitic, whose schwa is
elided: see §2.5.1. Segmental transcription: [aÚr˙÷vænÚ˙].

The first IP in (18) has both high and low accents because it has two tonic syllables. The
second one has only one tonic syllable, but scans as an IP because the posttonic syllable can
replace the low accent.
     The proclitics my= (imperative negative), cy= (nonfinite negative), chy= 'in, into', and
t'y= 'on, onto' do not have stress but have high tone (§4.2) which causes the following tonic
word to have lower pitch, which I transcribe as low accent on the tonic syllable. Phrases like
(19)-(21) thus also scan as IP's, though they contain only one tonic syllable.(19)   m»y=jèlxa

       'going in'     Tonic words preceding the prosodic phrase are usually pronounced with some
prominence and medium to high pitch, though they are less salient than the primary and
secondary stresses of the prosodic phrase itself, and their pitch is slightly lower than that of
the primary stress.","[126, 127]"

                      Abbreviations and interlinear conventions     The interlinearizing conventions for examples cited here (most of them taken from the
Berkeley Ingush Corpus) were initially worked out in 1996 by Zev Handel and Ronald
Sprouse for an example sentences database accompanying the lexical database on which
Nichols & Sprouse 2004 is based. The example sentences database formed the core of BITC
(Sprouse 1997), which holds the Berkeley Ingush Corpus described in Data Sources below.
     Inflectional morpheme boundaries are generally not written in the Ingush forms (they are
written only where the segmentation is at issue), and in the interlinear their categories are
separated by periods (not hyphens). This is done in part because many inflectional categories
are marked by ablaut, suppletion, and other unsegmentable phenomena; in part because it is
not always clear whether the schwa vowels often found at inflectional morpheme boundaries
should be segmented with the root or with the affix; and in part in order to ensure that words
look as much as possible like readable words. Syntactically relevant derivational morphemes,
especially verb prefixes and valence-affecting suffixes, are hyphenated off.
     Syntax examples extracted from natural text have sometimes had pauses, corrections, etc.
editorially removed where this does not affect the point at issue. In Chapter 35 (Texts), all
such things are intact.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"Hence Ingush has both stress (mostly fixed initial) and tone (high vs. lack of tone).
Distinctive high tone appears most often on unstressed syllables. The finite verb bears a pitch
contour unique to it: a sharp rise-fall located on the tonic syllable or a high-toned suffix. The
precipitous fall to low tone on the syllable after this rise-fall is especially audible in the
witnessed past negative, where the tone-bearing syllable is followed by another in the same
word. In the following example the low tone is underlined:(42)   vealândzar           '(he) didn't go' (negative, witnessed past)     At a more abstract level I believe that all finite verb forms may have high tone on the
root or suffix. In the present tense it is not readily audible as the present tense is generally
monosyllabic so there is no adjacent non-high syllable for comparison. In (12) and (12´) the
pitch contour is not identical: bú in (12´) is higher than bólx in (12), and bù in (12) is higher
than àaz in (12´). In (12´) the first accented word has high accent and high tone, so it is
higher in pitch than the first accented word of (12).
     Though this is less certain, it appears that in clauses with verb-second word order
(§30.2.3) the verb has high accent and its separated prefix or preverbal word, which is clause-
final, has low accent. That is, a verb-second clause does not have an orthodox IP consisting
of the rightmost two tonic syllables; rather, the same accent contour spans the entire clause.
A simple example with a short clause is in (43), where forms of d.ieza 'need, want' are in
                                 4. Prosody and prosodic wordhood                              109
second position.55 For clarity the high accent mark is placed before the entire verb, not on the
tonic syllable.(43)    axcha      ´diêza    cynna        'he needs money' (present)
        money                3s.DAT
                   ´diezâc                'he doesn't need money' (negative)
                   ´diêzar                'he used to need money' (imperfect)
                   ´diizâr                'he needed money (e.g. yesterday)' (witnessed past)
                   ´diizândzar            'he didn't need money (e.g. yesterday)' (negative)
                   ´diizâad               'he (evidently) needed money' (nonwitnessed)     The rise-fall pitch is imposed by the tone, and the syllable of a verb that it falls on is
determined by the tone of the verb form. As a result, there is actually a phonetic contrast in
tone on stressed syllables, as the imperfect (with its rise-fall on the root syllable) differs in
tone from nonfinite forms, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, etc. (with stress on the initial
syllable). A minimal triad, shown in (44), comes from the conjugation type in which
witnessed past, imperfect, and verbal noun all have the same root vocalism (all have the same
segmental suffix or ending -(a)r). Here the circumflex is used for the rise-fall and the acute
accent for the pitch accompanying ordinary stress.(44)    lâtar      'used to fight' (imperfect)
        latâr      'fought' (witnessed past) (lätar)
        látar      'fighting, a fight' (verbal noun)On all three of the forms the tonic syllable is the first one, as indicated by its amplitude and
the reduction of all posttonic vowels (in the witnessed past the second syllable has the same
schwa quality as in the other two forms). Impressionistically, the witnessed past sounds
rather like a Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian disyllable with rising pitch (though the sharp fall to a
low tone in the following word, i.e. after the high-fall tone, is unlike Bosnian/Croatian/
Serbian). The verbal noun sounds like an initial-stressed word in any stress language, or like
a word with a falling tone in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian. The imperfect, with its sharp rise
(clearly audible even on a short vowel) and sharp fall to a low pitch on the following syllable,
sounds like something one expects to find only in a language with a system of contrastive
contour tones.
     There is a tendency for diphthongs to be pronounced as rising under the rise-fall tone and
falling under ordinary stress:(45)    diêzar              [di»‰:zar]         'was supposed to', 'used to like' (imperfect)

110                                       Ingush Grammar
In the following, from a recorded conversation, the schwa of the high-tone mild imperative
ending is reduced, leaving only a voiced /l/ and transferring its high tone to the preceding
syllable, where again the diphthong is rising:(46)     mielalazh {mielâlazh}          [mi»‰lÚi«z] 'drinking' (drink:PLC.IMPVfut.PL)(The first part of the geminate [l:] also has high tone.)
     The contrast of rise-fall vs. ordinary high tone on the first syllables of the imperfect and
verbal noun is phonemicized, given that it is part of the ordinary pronunciation of these forms
in isolation. Not all speakers perceive it as pitch, however; one of my consultants perceives it
as something like stress, and the rest, though they are aware of it or can be made aware of it,
seem to think of it as part of the phrasal prosody and not as part of the sound system.","[131, 132, 133]"

progressive verbs, most often laatt, lit. 'stand'. Laatt implies that the speaker knowingly or
deliberately performs the action. It is not literal; the subject need not be actually standing
(though, when asked, speakers sometimes say that the subject must be standing). D.aagha 'sit'
implies stubborn and/or continued performance of the activity despite negative indications;
when asked, speakers say that the subject must be sitting, but in actual usage it is not clear
that this is essential. Ull 'lie' is used only when the subject is literally lying down performing
the action. D.oall, lit. 'be contained', strongly connotes agentivity.
     Meaning: A prototypical progressive, where the activity fills a time frame and is in
progress at the moment of speech. Typically, the speaker sees the subject performing the
action. With ingressive and punctual verbs the meaning can be 'is beginning to…'. Pear story
narratives told in the present tense have many tokens of this tense. All of what has been said
here applies only to clauses with animate and especially human subjects; with inanimate
subjects these verbs do not seem to have progressive force, either as lexical stance verbs or as
auxiliaries.","[291, 292]"
"                         1.2. Typological overview of IngushIngush has a fairly large consonant system with three manners of articulation (voiced,
voiceless, ejective) and including uvulars and pharyngeals. Ejectives are not particularly
forceful and plain voiceless stops are not aspirated, so plain-ejective contrast is less audible
than in most languages of the Caucasus. Pharyngealization (phonetically, epiglottalization)
is a phonation property of syllables, audible mostly on the vowel but its distribution based
mostly on the onset consonant. There is a minimal tone system, and a distinctive descending
""sawtooth"" prosody that very demarcates phrases. The vowel system is large, with
diphthongization of most of the long vowels and much centralization of the short vowels.
There is an underlying long/short opposition which surfaces partly as length and partly as a
tense/lax opposition; there is a schwa, whose elision produces long vowels in open syllables
and thereby phonemicizes pure length at least for some speakers. Those speakers who can
hear schwas seem to perceive them as something other than vowels; still, in chanting, other
metric genres, and the speech of some of the oldest generations schwas are audible as vowels,
and those schwas that occur in what I call restressed position are full vowels (and heard as
such). This system of vowel-zero alternations, different sources of length, and schwas with
unusual phonetic status makes it almost impossible to devise a writing system that is
straightforwardly phonemic, a situation that makes it very difficult to achieve literacy given
the way Ingush is taught. Other aspects of the Ingush orthography make it very difficult to
sound out words or spell correctly based on pronunciation.
     Ingush is a mostly dependent-marking language. Nouns and pronouns distinguish eight
basic cases and some further secondary ones, whose endings are mostly monoexponential (i.e.
non-cumulative) and, in the plural, follow a separate plural suffix. There are four gender
agreement markers which distinguish, depending on how one counts them, up to eight
genders. Gender agreement is a partial category: only about 30% of the verb roots and 10%
of the adjective roots take gender agreement. Ingush also has overt inherent gender, where
the gender-bearing noun itself has a prefix marking its gender; this is also a partial category,
and is usually but not always the same as the agreement gender class of the noun.
     Verbs distinguish a very large number of tenses, which blend aspect and evidentiality
with pure tense. In addition to these there is stem-internal marking of plurality (of S/O)
and/or pluractionality, both partial categories. Apart from the tenses, Ingush distinguishes
various kinds of evidentiality and mirativity by other means such as suffixation and particles.
     The three word classes of noun, verb, and adjective are strictly differentiated
inflectionally, syntactically, and in terms of word formation, but they are not on equal footing
in the language. Ingush has a noun-based lexicon: elementary noun roots are an open class,
                           1. The Ingush language and its speakers                             11
while verb and adjective roots are closed classes (about 200 members each). The verbal
lexicon is split: the basic verbs (the closed class) have consistently ergative alignment in their
agreement and derivation, and take the full set of suffixal valence-affecting derivations; the
open class is phrasal predicates with light verbs, and they are mostly accusative in alignment
and limited in derivational possibilities (since most of the light verbs are transitive, while
several derivational categories are limited to intransitives). Basic verbs are mostly
intransitive and form semantic causatives by morphological transitivization; phrasal
predicates and compound verbs form causatives by transitivity-neutral processes such as
suppletion and change of light verb. Adjectives and manner adverbs are not formally distinct,
and neither are converbs and participles. On the other hand, attributive and non-attributive
adjectives, participals, and cardinal numerals are kept strictly distinct.
     The numerals are base-ten for the first two decades and base-twenty thereafter. They
form an unusually rich set of derivatives such as ordinals, distributives, nominalized forms,
plex forms, and others.
     Verbs form a large set of converbs: three basic ones (anterior, sequential, simultaneous)
used in chaining and a large set used in various kinds of adjunct subordination. There is
rather little finite subordination and almost no subordinating conjunctions; converb clauses
and nominalization are the main devices for complementation and adjunct subordination.
     Though verbs of perception generally have dative subjects and stative one-argument
phrasal verbs often have ergative subjects, making it possible to classify Ingush as split
intransitive, it is nonetheless consistently ergative overall, in the morphology of agreement,
case, and verbal derivation, and in syntax. There are almost no valence alternations (such as a
locative alternation). There are derivations that change valence or argument structure
(inceptive, causative) but no inflectional or syntactically-based passivization or the like.
     There is extensive and systematic long-distance reflexivization, accusative to neutral in
its alignment, subject- and object-controlled, and partly working to overcome the coreference
problems inherent in contexts of obviation.
     Phrases are head-final. Clause word order is like that of early Germanic: verb-final with
frequent verb-second order in main clauses (with prefixes and first elements of compound
verbs left in clause-final position). In most kinds of complex sentences the finite clause
follows the converb clauses. Where English would use clause or VP coordination with
conjunction reduction, Ingush uses chaining and therefore imposes a grammatically rigid
framework with argument sharing and strict choice of verb forms with sequence of tenses on
what would, in English, be a much freer matter of juxtaposing or coordinating sentences with
the same subject or topic. Relativization uses deletion, and unlike chaining and various forms
of nonfinite complementation, which have strict case and/or valence constraints on sharing,
there are almost no constraints on what can be relativized.
     Sentences are also mostly head-final, in that most chained and many subordinate clauses
precede the main clause. Controllers of coreference-constrained phenomena, and overt
tokens of shared arguments, are generally in the main clause. Controlled phenomena
themselves can and often do extend far to the left. Long-distance reflexivization and case-
12                                      Ingush Grammar
based argument sharing in core chaining, in particular, can extend over many clauses.
Logophoricity affects the immediately dominated clause. These and other factors that require
calculating from the end of the sentence while producing it from the beginning indicate that
fluent speech, especially narrative, requires a good deal of advance planning on the part of the
speaker. Even the phrase and clause prosody require parsing starting from the right edge of
the constituent. Though the Berkeley Ingush Corpus contains mostly the speech of the older,
fully fluent generations and most of my elicitation has been done with fully fluent speakers,
what information I have on the younger generations indicates that many of them are no longer
in full command of the grammatical phenomena requiring this extent of advance planning. If
this is indeed the case, and the younger generation cannot construct complex narrative in
Ingush, the language is becoming restricted in its ability to handle one of the essential
everyday functions.","[33, 34, 35]"
"Tense/aspect/mood categories are signaled by the ablaut grade of the root and the ending.
There are also analytic tenses, such as the progressive tenses, signaled by a combination of
converb and tense auxiliary (not shown in (1)). There is no person agreement. About 30% of
the simple verbs take gender agreement marked by mutation of the initial consonant; the
others have no gender agreement in the root. (Some endings and a number of derivational
suffixes and light verbs and tense auxiliaries also agree in gender, so though only 30% of the
roots agree in gender, probably well over 50% of the inflected verb forms have gender
agreement somewhere.) Negation, not shown in (1), is suffixal in finite forms and proclitic
elsewhere (§13.12). The first clitic slot includes proclitic nonfinite negation and the chaining
enclitic ='a (§24.4); both can be present in the same verb form. The final clitic slot includes
pragmatic and evidential proclitics and some postverbal particles that are unstressed but not
strictly cliticized.

    Examples are (2)-(7), beginning with the simplest inflected forms, which consist of only
a root in an ablaut grade and an ending, and continuing with more complex inflected forms.
The ablaut grade of the stem (past, present, infinitive) is shown after the colon (in these
examples only and not in the rest of the grammar). Tense auxiliaries (here and throughout the
grammar: §13.0.3) are interlinearized with the name of the tense category, while the lexical

    '(they) must have invited (him)' (inferential perfect tense)     In most respects, Ingush verb morphology conforms to the standard expectations that
marking of derivational categories is inside of inflectional categories and more outer elements
have scope over more inner ones. Thus the deictic prefix, which is in the first slot, situates
the entire predicate, including its local prefix, in space. Derivational suffixes are followed by
inflectional endings (tense, aspect, mood: see Chapter 13), and these are followed by
pragmatic and evidential clitics and other elements which qualify or comment on the entire

predicate including the inflectional categories. There are departures from this neat picture,
however, most of them involving agreement. Gender agreement is marked by mutation of the
root-initial consonant (see Chapters 7 and 19),106 but the future and nonwitnessed tenses also
have gender agreement in their endings, and tense auxiliaries (not shown in (1)) may have
gender agreement initially and/or in endings. Gender agreement is inflection, but as it has no
place in the semantics it cannot be said that the various and often multiple markings of gender
are actual exceptions to a generalization based on scope. Plurality (plural number agreement)
and pluractionality (multiple action) in verbs (for which see Chapter 14) are expressed root-
internally, by changes of the final consonant(s) and/or by suppletion. Tense is expressed by
both endings (relatively outer affixes, as is expected) and ablaut of the verb root (the
innermost position).","[258, 259, 260]"

"                                      29.6. Obviation     Obviation is the obligatory ranking of third person nominals (nouns, pronouns) based on
discourse function, syntactic relations, and semantic properties such as animacy. One
nominal in a clause is proximate (as are all its coreferents); the others (and their coreferents)
are obviative. Proximate outranks obviative for access to syntactic roles and processes.
Languages differ in whether and how they require that obviation ranking be aligned with
syntactic relations and animacy ranking. (This analysis of obviation, and the examples and
criteria below, are all due to Aissen 1997.)
       Since both possessors and subjects are proximate by definition, in languages with
obviation the following two kinds of configurations are problematic or impossible because
they make two different referents compete for proximate status. (In these schematic English
examples the asterisk means not that the English sentence is ungrammatical but that its
equivalent in a language with obviation would be ungrammatical.)
662                                   Ingush Grammar
       (a) possessor of subject is coreferential to object (bad because possessor is proximate,
therefore subject is obviative and object proximate, therefore obviation and grammatical
relations are misaligned): *Musai's wife is looking for himi; *Musai's friends scared himi. The
same configuration is acceptable where the coreferential nominals are not third person: your
wife is looking for you, etc.
       (b) main-clause subject (proximate) is coreferential to subordinate-clause object (which
is then outranked by an obviative subject in the subordinate clause): *Mariemi asked when
Musa had seen heri.
     When animacy is aligned with obviation, animates are proximate and inanimates
obviative. In such languages a third configuration is problematic or ungrammatical:
     (c) inanimate subject and animate object of transitive verb, e.g. *the snow covered the
sheep.
     Obviation has so far been attested only in head-marking languages (Aissen 1997:743),
where strictly grammatical constraints such as obviation are functionally valuable because
they can narrow down the assignment of reference and syntactic relations to formally
unmarked nominals. Something much like obviation is also evident in Ingush, a strongly
dependent-marking language, where it shows up as otherwise inexplicable gaps in formal
antecedence, i.e. in contexts like (a) above. Here are Ingush examples for contexts (a), (b),
and (c).
    (a) Third person possessors of subjects cannot formally antecede objects. Asterisked
examples here are ungrammatical where possessor and third person pronoun are coreferential
(but may be grammatical if they are non-coreferential).","[684, 685]"
"Negation or assertion can also trigger reduplication, either for emphasis or to make clear that
the verb itself is the focus of negation. The reduplicate is followed by ='a or negation.",[397]

interrogative citic variously on the clitic and on the preceding syllable: {tuox=ii} 'strike?'

d=îi 'is?', d=ôi 'does it make? do they make?', etc.
     The answer to a yes-no question is generally just the finite verb form, optionally with any
additional words needed for expansion on the answer. The subject can be included
(postverbally, and often with slight a pause before it). Less often, the entire clause can be
repeated. The particle aa 'no' can preface one of the more elaborated replies. (Ha'a 'yes' is
not used often in answers, though it is sometimes used in affirmations (§32.6).) Emphatic
deara can be clause-initial or follow the verb. Here and below, A and B lines are the different
speakers in a dialog. (2B) shows a number of possible answers.","[732, 733]"
"5.6.3. Tonic words. Comparison: sanna, muo 'like'. (Phrasal scope. §23.1.)
     Delimiting: maara 'only, except' (§31.5), duhhwal 'chiefly, primarily'. (Phrasal scope.)
     Local: gholla, daa, both 'along', following a postposition (§17.1.6).
     Subordinating conjunctions occur in the subordinate clause and mark it as subordinate of
some particular type. There are very few of them in Ingush; the clearest examples are
nagahw sanna 'if' (§27.2.2), hana ealcha 'because' (§27.2.1.), and xaana 'time.DAT', which
takes a modifying oblique participial clause, the whole meaning 'at the time that/when…'.
The anterior and sequential converbs of 'say' eanna/ealie/oalie function as complementizer
with speech verbs (§25.3). Most subordinate clauses are marked by nonfinite verb forms,
specifically converbs if they are adjunct subordinates (such as clauses of time, reason, etc.).
     Linking conjunctions: t'aaqqa 'then, so then', heata 'then, so', yshta 'so', cuduhwa
'therefore, so', etc. These occur in the main clause and mark it as having a subordinate clause
or more generally as a main clause with an event that is semantically contingent on that main
clause. For examples see §16.2.3.4. It is worth noting that the subordinating conjunctions
hana ealcha and eanna/ealie/oalie are often prosodically in the main clause, which may mean
that they are turning into linking conjunctions.

    Parentheticals: These are adverbs that clarify the logical status and logical sequence of
phrases, clauses, or sentences and their sequence in reasoning. They differ from linking and
subordinating conjunctions in that they do not identify the function of one clause in relation to
another, though some of them can have phrases clauses or sentences in their scope. They are
usually positioned at clause or sentence edges, or adjacent to the word in their scope.
Examples include xietarjgahw 'probably', gheahhwaa 'exactly, precisely', deara 'of course'.

"     ""Particle"" is as good a term as any for this formally diverse but functionally unified set of
uninflected words. All are uninflected in the sense that they do not form the standard noun
and verb inflectional paradigms, though some of them bear frozen inflection, and some of
them enter into functional paradigmatic sets with other words such that they can be
considered inflectional. None has an independent clause word order position; all are
positioned relative to the clause boundaries, the clause head (the inflected verb form), or the
word in the particle's scope. All have scope but no arguments or valence. (In their scope and
positioning they differ from interjections, which largely stand outside of clause and sentential
syntax: §5.7.) They lack lexical meaning and can be described as grammatical elements.

   One speaker says that (95) does not necessarily have negative connotations but requires some
special context, e.g. continuation of a narrative. See §15.5.1.4 just below.

     15.5.1.4. Narrative sequencing. In elicitation it is often observed that a verb ordinarily
lacking a deictic prefix tends to take one in narrative, when the clause is sequenced relative to
the preceding and following clauses. In the examples found so far, the choice of hwa- vs.
dwa- follows person-based deixis, but the presence vs. absence of the prefix slot as a whole
has the function of narrative sequencing. (The prefixed examples here were not extracted
from narrative but were elicited in minimal pairs to the unprefixed ones, and the consultant
volunteered that the prefixed ones would normally be sequenced.)(96) a. Yz suona bwara+hwazhar.

         (Then) Ahmed looked at you. (In a narrative sequence)     15.5.1.5. Imperatives. For reasons that are not clear, imperatives often take deictic
prefixes (in true person-based deixis).
     Perhaps because deictic prefixes are common on imperatives, when minimal pairs with
and without deictic prefixes are elicited out of context the prefixed form is sometimes
interpreted as implying a previous imperative: 138(98) a. Aaz komarazh jeaxar

       important only to the hearer and not to both men.)13.6.4. Cumulative focus: =q. This particle is enclitic and found only on finite verbs. It puts
the entire clause or sentence into focus or emphasis in a larger discourse context. Often the
preceding sentence or two lead up to the focal one; sometimes the focal one is a key juncture
in a narrative or the summary of an argument or other discussion. Sometimes the particle can
be glossed ""Oh, it's just that…"",""What's going on is..."", ""The point is ..."", or "" ..., that's what /
why ..."". Some speakers use it more often than others. There are several examples in §35.3.
     This particle is pronounced as a cluster with any consonant that precedes it, without any
assimilation, epenthetic schwa, or other adjustment.

appear to be no less independent words than joax or hwuona (§§13.6.1-3 above), which are
never written with a hyphen. They are more or less synonymous introspective interrogatives
that can be rendered 'I wonder whether' (often with an implication that the speaker hopes the
complement is or will be true) and are used almost exclusively in questions (including
interrogative complements) and almost never on negative forms.
     In main clauses hwogh is used most often in questions, where the sense is 'I wonder
whether…', 'I wonder what…', etc. It looks like a form of the second person singular
pronoun, but in natural text examples it seems that the speaker never expects the hearer to
have the answer.(213) galanjg jaaxar       fy    mawan dolazh         dy-hwogh

inserted between the verb root and whatever elements precede it, including prefixes and first

words, so the compound or prefixed verb stem is broken into two pieces and the inserted

        (kep otta-ju 'pretend', lit. 'make semblance, pose the appearance')    Mel 'how much' is regularly used in this way with 'be' and a few other verbs, in a greatly
broadened, probably incipiently grammaticalized function of open-ended or indefinite
quantification (§9.2.12). The sense of some such examples can be rendered with English Wh-
ever. Expecially where incipiently lexicalized, this mel undergoes Wackernagel vowel
reduction (§3.3.10) and is pronounced [m\l], though in other examples it is tonic and is often
parsed together with the following word in a two-stress IP.","[391, 392, 393, 394]"
