Allosemes                are    narrow         glosses                       (in    the    sense        of    narrow        transcription),                   while        sememes                       are    the    broad        glosses       from     which            the narrow               glosses                       are    predictable.

"                                522.2.      Numeral        classifier             affixes,
                                So far      20 lexical          affixes           have     been     found        which |
                       can be added            to numerals.                ‘The chapter           on numerals
                       will     cover     them      in more         depth     and     will        cover     the
                       extensive         numeral       allomorphy            involved.             These     affixes
                       are    listed here           because         over half        of them         can     also        be
                       affixed         to roots       which     are not numerals.                    Eight        of
                      them      can also        be affixed           to the       numerical          interroga-

                      seem     to function            in the        same    manner        as numeral             class-

                      can     be affixed         to numeral           roots       in order to count
                      certain      nouns;         nouns       with     identical           lexical         meaning

                                    Numeral         classifier        affixes        were       apparently        used
                        more        extensively            in pre-contact            times       or    even 70 years

                        speakers         remember           many    of   them       and    use    them     obliga-                        torily.          The        range    of numbers          they      can be used with
                        also varies             with       the   affix.        In the       following           table
                        the numeral             classifier          affixes         are    listed       with     range
                        of affixability                (those       with      greatest          range     are    listed
                        first), affixability to k’{-1, affixability to non-
                        numeral        roots,         and whether           they     are    obligatory           or
                        optional.             For     allomorphy          of the         affixes        see the
