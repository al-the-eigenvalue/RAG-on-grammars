            The attention getting particle aka 'hey!' is often inserted at the beginning
     of an utterance such as a question to attract the addressee's attention:
     (5.67) (aka) ma- y         idim-     ge bakyamu- 0           awgog- em?
              hey 2SgS-Deix morning-Loe Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 big climb-All
              '(Hey,) are you going up to the top of the hill tomorrow?

              'Hey, will I sleep here at this place?
            There is a particle -aw which is cliticised onto the last word in the sentence.
     It operates like a tag question asking for confirmation or just checking to see
     whether the speaker has the addressee's attention:
     (5.69) ma kcira mir asor- 0-                  aw?
              2SgA lSgGen word listen-Fut2/3-tag
               'You will listen to what I am saying, won't you?'

              3SgS Restr alone Adj go- tag
               'He went on his own, didn't he?'
            There is also a vocative suffix -oy affixed to a proper noun when the person
     being addressed is distant or non-visible. When the person is close-by, no marker
     is used:
     (5.71) Kosir-oy 'hey Kosir!'
              Warib-oy 'hey W arib!'
              Eydyana-oy 'hey Eidiana!'
              ?Pomoy-oy 'hey Pomoy!'
            Examples need to be collected to see whether this suffix can be used when
     kinship terms or common nouns are used for address forms:
            ?ama-oy        'hey mother!'
            ?berbet-oy 'hey sibling!'
            ?nap-oy        'hey grandchild!'
            ?kerim le-oy 'hey boss!'
            It can also be used with interrogative pronouns where the forms will differ
     depending on whether what is being questioned is animate (-oy) or inanimate
     (-ay): e.g. nete-oy 'who?'; nalu(w)-ay 'what?'

 '     5.5.2 Imperatives.
           As we saw earlier in the section on temporal/ aspectual morphology, there
     is no distinction between the future and the imperative for 2nd person. The
     same form of the verb is used for both functions. However, the pronoun can be
     omitted when it is being used with an imperative function:
                                                                                 193

        'Eat this (you two).'
      When it is a negative imperative, the verb can be used in its nominal form
with the privative suffix:
(5.74) nole ero-0              nole aro- kak
        Neg eat-Fut2/3         Neg eatN-Priv
        'Don't eat it.'
      Note, however, that the privative nominal is actually ambiguous for the
utterance could be interpreted as '(It's) inedible' although there is a different
intonation for each.","[203, 204, 205]"
"5.5.3 Reported Speech.
       No examples of indirect speech have been collected in the data despite the
fact that there are some 150 pages of texts. The most common strategy is to report
speech directly. A complement kega can optionally be used to introduce the
speech act. It may be related to the following deictic markers: ke(y) 'in this
manner, way' + ga 'and then, and also there':

       to her: ""! am a person.""'5.6   Negation.
      The negation particle nole - ne (these are in free variation) 'not, no' must
precede the verb and typically occurs following the first accented element in the
utterance to negate an event:
(5.77) wi       kikem-ge
        3n SgS first- Loe
        nole umer-kak da-r(a)-       a               le

(5.79) ma nole abi dip-         0        2SgA Neg 3Sg0 dob in- Fut2/3
        'Don't dob him in.'
      The negation particle can sometimes occur at the beginning of a clause
which is intonationally dependent on the preceding clause:
(5.80) wi       sikak we- ge akarik-ley,
        3n SgS okay beach-Loe land- PastDual
        nole le-      lut yabi    na-    rdar-i

        'They (2) landed on the beach, allright, no-one saw them.'
        (Dewmer, p209, section7)5.7    Valency Changes.
       In the section on the intransitiviser ba-, the prefix was shown to make
transitive verbs intransitive either by making the A the S argument as it is
reflexive, or by making the 0 the S argument of the intransitivised verb. This
process is exploited in the language for a number of So/listic effects.
       The intransitiviser can be used with events affecting inalienable body parts
where the Sis reflexive and the non-S argument, if there is one, is either
interpreted as a non-syntactic argument or as part of the verb phrase:                                                                          195
     (5.81)   ka     imus ba- tu- Ii

              'I am shaving myself.' (lit: I am beard-shaving)
     (5.82) Gamalay ba- trimurik-li
              G.S        lntr-stretch- Primpf
              'Gamalay is stretching.'
            Contrast 5.81 with 5.83 and 5.82 with 5.84:
     (5.83) Lez-ide tabara imus itw- i
              L.- A 3Gen beardO shave-Pf
              'Les shaved his beard.'
     (5.84) ka netat teter erapey-                 da, ka netat teter itrimurik-da
              lSgA one footO break Sg/DualO-PfSg lSgA one footO stretch- PfSg
              'I have one leg folded, I have one leg stretched out.'
            A much larger corpus of data is required to establish what the meaning
     difference is between using the transitive and the intransitive forms. To date,
Â·,   only events involving body parts have been collected with this kind of case frame
 I     and one could hypothesize that there is a preference for these types to be treated
     in this way because an intransitivised verb allows the 0 to be expressed within
     the verb phrase, making it parallel in form and function to reflexive
     constructions.
            There is an innovation in the use of the intransitiviser bai which is
     sometimes being used for events that are not necessarily reflexive, but rather
     because the same pronominal free form is used. As was seen earlier, the same
     pronominal forms can be used for the reflexive, i.e. oneself, as well as the
     exclusive meaning, i.e. by oneself:
     (5.85) ka imus itw- i kababu
               lSgA beardO shave-Pf Exel
               'I shaved my beard by myself.'
      (5.86) ka kababu imus ba- tw-            i
               lSgS lSgRefl beard Intr-shave-Pf
               'I shaved myself.'
             However, speakers are sometimes making the verb intransitive when it is
     the intensive pronominal function:
      (5.87) ma        mabu        ba- smer-0
               2SgA/S Refl/Excl lntr-see- Fut2/3
               'See yourself - See for yourself.'
             Thus, the presence of the intransitiviser morpheme doe.6 not,in such
      instances) , indicate a reflexive action.It is the result of the pronominal free
      form, marking a reflexive action (i.e. 5=0) and/or an exclusive meaning (i.e.
      nonsyntactic).","[205, 206, 207]"
"                                                                            49
          (from the tape made for Social Security)
        The suffix can also be used with nominalised verbs in a negative
imperative:
(2.114) ma nole aro- kak
          2SgA Neg eatN-Priv
          'Do not eat (it).'
(The above use needs to be tested with nonsingular (pro)nouns to see whether it
is still possible without the usual cross-referencing for number on the verb.)
         Morphemes beginning with a voiceless velar stop such as the privative
suffix -kak or the intensifier suffix -kar (see section 4 below p52) devoice the final
consonant of the root if it is a voiced stop:
/b/        >        p/-+k                      kap-kar 'original M.I. dance'
/d/         >       t                          (>kab 'dance' + kar 'intensifier')
/g/        >        k                          tebut-kak 'without friend'
                                               (>tebud 'friend' + kak 'privative')
                                               la(k)-kak 'dislike, not want'
                                               (>lag 'desire, want' + kak 'privative')3)     The semblative suffix -ise is affixed to a (pro)nominal which is the object of
comparison. There are no examples of this affix followed by a case inflection:
(2.115) e     eper-da ebur-ise
        3SgS fly- PfSg bird- Smbl
        'He flew like a bird.'
(2.116) Gilam -ide ab+ab- ise dikepwar-er               lamar koskir

        'Gilam thought as he had the last time that (she) was a ghost.'
       The suffix -ise is frequently preceded by an affix -ka whose meaning is not
clear. Examples of its use are:
(2.117) ma pe siga           iri- Ii      kari-ka-yse
        2SgA Deix ciggieO drink-Primpf lsg- ?- Smbl

         'No-one knows how to make it (cocnnuted rice) like one's Kosir.'
(Note that in the above sentence, the privative phrase is functioning like a
predicate.)                                                                               50
      It may be that the semblative suffixes -kayse and -ise do not signal any
meaningful difference but are simply in free alternation. Alternatively, it may beO,
mor.photogical distinction where common nouns take the form -ise and other
nominals (pronouns and proper nouns) take the form -kayse.
        The suffix -kayse is also used with adjectives with a comparative effect:
(2.120) able wag kikem kelar- kak wam-i
         Det windS first       strength-Priv blow-Pf
         a       no abra       kelar     aw-ka-yse batay-0
         Conj Restr 3SgGen strengths big-?- Smbl grow-Pf
         'At first, the wind blew without strength (but then), its strength just
         grew bigger (or big-like?).'
        The related suffix -ka, which is often reduplicated on adjectives, occurs as a't\i
intensifier to indicate a greater or lesser degree:
(2.121) e       aw le      da-               Ii
         3SgS big person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'He is a big/old man.'
(2.122) e       aw-ka+ka le          da-             Ii
         3SgS big- Intens person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'He is a very big/old person.'
        In 2.122, -ka(ka) is functioning as an adjectival intensifier. There is a
similar derivation -kar which is added to nouns as an intensifier with the
meaning 'the real N, the even more like N':
(2.123) keymer-          kar
         young sibling-Intens
         'the youngest sibling'
(2.124) u-          kar    pe da-                 Ii
         coconut-Intens Deix n PIS be(person?)-Prlmpf
         'Those are the proper kind of palm trees.'
        The suffix -ka occurring on adjectives and the suffix -kar occurring on
nouns could be related and these in turn are probably related to the semblative
construction with -kayse.
        There are comparative constructions with the ablative case used to mark a
standard comparison (2.125 and 2.126) and the allative case used to mark the
property with respect to which a comparison is made (2.127):
 (2.125) yaba         mir wi          dipigeme-daryey, akay-da yaba            mir

"2.     Language Oassification and Type.
       Unlike its neighbour Kala Lagaw Ya, which is classified as an Australian
Paman language, Meryam Mir is classified by Wurm (Ibid) as a Papuan language
of the Trans-Fly stock with a close genetic relationship to the languages of the
Eastern Trans-Fly Family, Bine, Gidra and Gizra.
       Its phonology is relatively simple, comprising a three way distinction in
point of articulation for oral voiced and voiceless stops (bilabial, alveolar and
velar) and a two way distinction in point of articulation for nasal stops and glides                                                                                 1
(bilabial and alveolar). The remaining consonants, a voiced and voiceless
fricative, a lateral and a rhotic tap, are all produced at the alveolar point of
articulation. The language has a five vowel system contrasting front and back
vowels /i, e/ and /u, o/ with a low central vowel /a/. The pitch-accent is
phonemically significant in the language, serving to distinguish certain lexical
items. Every word bears a high pitch on either the first or second syllable with
the majority of words carrying high pitch on the second syllable. The phonology
is covered in Chapter 1.
       The following word classes can be distinguished: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs, deictics and interjections. Nouns and pronouns are
inflected for syntactic and non-syntactic cases. The cases are: ergative,
nominative, accusative, instrumental, allative (which includes some of the
functions of dative in other languages), ablative, locative, associative (which
could be labelled alternatively 'comitative') and genitive. There is a split case
marking system with an ergative case pattern on nouns for subjects of transitive
verbs and a nominative case pattern on pronouns for subjects of transitive or
intransitive verbs. Within the noun category, a distinction can be drawn between
common and proper nouns. With proper nouns, there is a three way split in the
case marking system with distinct inflections for the subject of a transitive verb,
the object of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive verb. Adjectives
as well as possessors marked by the genitive immediately precede the noun
which they modify and are thus syntactically dependent on the noun which is the
head.
        Pronouns distinguish between first, second and third person with a further
distinction contrasting inclusion and exclusion for first person nonsingular. In
addition, there are distinct forms for the singular versus non-singular. There is
no gender distinction with third person. Word classes and nominals are covered
in Chapter 2.
        Verbs can be categorised into two classes: atelic stative and telic active.
These classes are morphologically determined since the atelic stative verbs only
include intransitive verbs which mark the subject by means of a prefix, whereas
 the telic active verbs mark either the transitive or intransitive subject
 predominantly by means of a suffix. The two verb classes are partially
 semantically motivated as suggested by the names atelic stative and telic active.
 Verbal cross-reference markers encode information about both number,
 distinguishing singular, dual, paucal and plural, and to some degree, person.
        Time is divided up along the lines of present versus non-present where
 present refers to events that occurred any time on the same day as the utterance
 and non-present for events that occurred on another day or will occur following
 the utterance. There are also aspectual features such as the imperfective and the
 perfective. In addition, there is a mood marker, the irrealis non-committal,                                                                            2
which conveys the lack of commitment on behalf of the speaker to say whether
something will happen or not. Temporal, aspectual and mood categories, cross-
reference markers and other features of the verbal morphology are covered in
Chapter 3. Included in this chapter is a brief survey of adverbs, their formation
and function.
       There is a rich and complex system of deixis in the language which is
explored in Chapter 4. Deictic markers' forms are determined by the temporal
occurrence of the event relative to the time of the utterance. Their function is to
essentially focus on various elements in space, time and in discourse itself.
       Existential/locational verbs, intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs
form the basis of simple clauses. However, there are many events or states which
are expressed by complex verbal phrases consisting of a noun and verb with
nominals forming an essential part of the verbal's meaning. In such instances,
the whole verb phrase must be regarded as a complex head. There are no valency
changing operations except for an intransitiviser morpheme. A verb's valency is
more or less fixed with some non-productive morphemes affecting the verb's
transitivity and with periphrastic constructions for expressing inchoative and
causative meanings. Basic sentence types, verbal and nominal phrases as well as

"      Meryam Mir is a Papuan language spoken in the Torres Strait, that stretch
of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It has an A-0-V
or S-V word order and an agglutinating morphology. Case inflections are
suffixed to nominals to mark their syntactic role in the clause. Markers cross-
referencing the syntactic arguments of the clause are affixed to the verb indicating
number and, to some degree, person. In typological terms, the language can be
regarded as a double-marking language.
      The following study is a sketch grammar of the language. Chapter 1 deals
with the phonology. Chapter 2 examines briefly the different word classes and
nominal morphology. Chapter 3 looks at verbals and their morphology. In
Chapter 4, the system of deictic markers is presented outlining some of its
functions and meanings. In Chapter 5, basic features of the syntax are outlined.

Acknowledgements.
       There are many people who must be thanked for their help. First and
foremost is the Murray Island Council who permitted me to come and live on
their island. All the people on Murray made me feel so welcome and I found
many new friends. I really need to thank everyone, from all the villages, from
Webok to Babud. Each and everyone contributed in one way or another and
taught me so much with diligence, patience and humour. The teaching sessions
often did not happen in formal sessions but when I was going for walks, at the
shops, having cups of tea, camping or picnicing at Dawar, spending time in
people's homes. To all those people, thank-you. To Les Saleee, his wife,
Maryann (Kosir), and their children, Galiga and Kinor, whom I lived with for all
those months and who became my dear family, thank-you. To all my other
relatives at Dew, thank-you. A special thanks to Tapim Binifather, Gamalai Passi
and Kathleen Salee who gave up their time to answer all my nit-picking queries,
helped me decipher texts and taught me more about their language. I would also
like to thank all those that allowed me to record stories: Henry Kaberi, Gracie
Barsa, Kaba Noah and his wife, James Rice, Eidiana Tabo, Meb Salee, Sam Passi
and many others. To each and everyone of you, 'big eso'.

        I would also like to thank my supervisors, Professor Dixon and Dr. Koch,
for all their helpful comments. My gratitude to all my friends, the 'Four
Muskateers', Felix 'Mangro' Ameka, Andy 'Slippery' Butcher, Ian 'Perv' Green
 and Nick 'Tufty' Reid as well as Yoshiko Sheard and my dearest friend Fran~oise
Dussart for all their support and assistance. There are too many to thank
individually but each one helped and encouraged me. Finally, to my family, all
my thanks and to Dotty, for making this last year very special.

                                     CHAPTER FOUR                                     DEICTIC MARKERS        4.1    Introduction.
               There is a closed class of markers grouped together on a semantic basis as
        their meaning is dependent and relative to a place, time, referent or proposition.
        They can be regarded as deictic markers because they are 'aspects of the
        interpretation of sentences that relate to the speech act situation' (Fillmore, 1975;
        8). In Meryam Mir, this is reflected in the choice of marker being determined by
        the time at which the event or state happens or is happening relative to the time
        of the speech act itself.
               It is unclear whether the deictic markers are words or not. They may or may
        not carry an accent. Their distribution in the sentence is equally unclear. They
        always follow the first element in a sentence and they nearly always occur before
        the verb in a clause. They never occur in isolation but always in conjunction
        with a verb which suggests they do not have independent grammatical status. In
        most examples, the deictic markers can be omitted without altering the
        grammatical status although there is obviously a change in meaning. Thus, the
        main functional load is on their meaning rather than their syntactic role.
               Their status and grammatical function will be discussed following a
        description of their forms, features and pragmatic/semantic function. However,
        several points should be made before the description:
        (i) Examples have been drawn mainly from texts or casual conversation as
        elicitation proved to be unsuccessful though desirable for testing certain claims.
        One of the consequences of such an approach is that there are major gaps in the
        data and not all meanings are contrasted.
        (ii) The glosses and free translations reflect the analysis of the researcher rather
        than informants' translations as they rarely gave any translation for the markers
        other than a spatial meaning and in some of the examples, such a translation was
         clearly inadequate.
         (iii) A number of features are given for each deictic marker which may prove in
.. ,I
  I     the light of further research to be irrelevant in establishing the contrast between
         them. Nonetheless these features have been included to make the treatment of
         each marker as extensive as possible.
         (iv) There is variation amongst speakers as to the appropriate or suitable marker
         to be used. Some speakers actually 'correct' the form of the marker used by
         another speaker, which suggests the deictic system is in a state of flux. Speakers
         do have choices depending on the perspective they wish to take and particular
         features which determine the choice of marker for one speaker may not be the                                                                                   146
     same prominent features which determine the choice for another speaker. In
     other words, a certain amount of variation within the system may be the result of
     ongoing changes.
     (v) The analysis presented below is by no means final but represents a working
     hypothesis based on the current corpus of data. Further study in the area may
     result in considerable changes.","[156, 157, 158]"
"5.     Sociolinguistic Notes.
       A special form of the language is used for grieving or expressing sympathy
for an individual. This speech style is called nas+nas rnir 'sorry talk' (lit: sad Adj
word) and only affects verbs by either changing the first vowel to /o/ or /u/ or by
inserting a bilabial glide between the initial consonant and vowel; e.g. dali 'be
Primpf' ---> dwali 'be Prlmpf in sorry talk'; digern 'walk' ---> dogern 'walk in
sorry talk' (see the section in Phonology on glides p. 10).
       Whilst all Meryam speakers on Mer can talk some Creole, it is not the case
that all Creole speakers can talk Meryam. For this reason, community affairs are
generally conducted in Creole. For example, when council candidates were
giving their election speech during my stay, only one out of six candidates
delivered their speech in Meryam.
       Furthermore, even with Meryam speakers, there is code-switching
depending upon the topic and addressee. In the family home, parents often
address their children in Creole, switching to Meryam when they want to discuss
something which does not concern them. However, many younger people in
their twenties and below, only have a passive knowledge of Meryam and,
consequently, always converse in Creole. It is only speakers in their mid-thirties
and above, with a sufficient grasp of Meryam, who can converse in it.
       The language of education is English with Creole used informally in the
classroom for giving instructions or explaining difficult concepts. Meryam is
taught for only half an hour or an hour a week in the school and is funded by the
Commonwealth government.
       The Creole spoken on Mer (and on the other Eastern Islands, see Shnukal
1988) does have a high proportion of Meryam lexical items. Similarly, speakers of
Meryam also employ Creole words although the proportion may vary
enormously from speaker to speaker and topic to topic. There are sometimes
preferences for words from a particular language and meanings can differ from
one language to another. For example, the Creole kinship terms sisi 'sister' and
bala 'brother' are used far more frequently than the Meryam term berbet 'sibling'.
An example of semantic shift is the instance of two children from one family
who use Creole terms rnarni 'mummy' and dadi 'daddy' for their parents and the
Meryam terms am.a 'mother' and bab 'father' for their grandparents instead of
the Meryam term kayed or ata for 'grandparent'.
       Not all speakers of Meryam have the same command and knowledge of
the language and future research must aim at documenting the range and
differences in forms, functions and meanings comparing conservative Meryam
and Creole.",[16]
"3.     Previous Research on the Language.
       Earlier work on Meryam has been limitgd in quantity and quality. In 1893,
Ray and Haddon published a study of vocabularies and grammatical notes drawn
from various missionaries', explorers' and researchers' notes. Unfortunately, the
study is subject to the contributors' spelling idiosyncracies, e.g. 'Maer' for Mer, to
interpretations of the sort: 'I think the variation of initial vowel is only due to
the influence of individual choice', and to dubious meanings because of personal
beliefs, e.g. omare 'mercy'.
       The most extensive study is that of Ray (1907) which provides some 40
pages of grammar, 30 pages of vocabulary and 30 pages of texts. Such a study
provides the opportunity to compare earlier and later forms of the grammar.
       A more recent work was undertaken by Bartos (1977), who provides a
preliminary study of the sounds of the language, and a paper by McConvell (1983};
who examines ergativity and verb agreement in the language to demonstrate that
Meryam cannot be said to be fully ergative or accusative in its system.
       In addition, there are a number of primary sources such as texts produced
by Meryam students at the School of Australian Linguistics in the newsletter
Ngali and field notes kindly made available by Rigsby.",[14]

4.5    Status and Grammatical Function of Deictic Markers.
       The deictic markers' status is ambiguous. Phonologically, they appear to be
independent words capable of bearing their own pitch-accent. (Pronouns either
get pre or postcliticized onto them):
(4.145) e-     pe ta- bakyamu- da
         3SgS-Deix Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
         'Then he came.'
(4.146) Kosir pe tabakyamuda
         'Kosir then came.'
       When they are being used with spatial reference, they often carry stronger
stress marking (evidenced by higher amplitude) which thus adds emphasis:
       Determining the deictic markers' position in a sentence is problematic.
There is a tendency for them to occur directly preceding the predicate or
following the first element in the clause, i.e. A/S-deictic-(0)-V, a position itself
frequently associated with clitics. Nonetheless, they frequently occur in a differeni
position although these are always predictable. They sometimes occur in clause
initial position when the A/S is omitted because its identity is already established
(see example 4.149). They sometimes occur following the verb bakyamu-/bakyaw-
'go'. When the deictic markers follow the verb, they always have the goal
meaning:
(4.147) e      baka ge
         3SgSgo Deix
         'He went there.'
       Their grammatical status makes them clearly dependent as they cannot
occur without a verb:
(4.148) e      nade da-                Ii?      pe da-                Ii
         3SgS where n PlS be(person)-Prlmpf Deix n PlS be(person)-Prlmpf
          'Where is he? He is there.'
        *pe
        *Npe
      Do the deictic markers carry a phoric/ co-referential element in their
meaning and do they have a syntactic role? There are examples where the subject
and deictic marker cannot co-occur within the same clause which suggests that
the markers do indeed carry some kind of phoric/ co-referential element and do
have a syntactic function. Consider:
(4.149) ki          bakyamu- daryey pamas-em able aw le-            kem
        1n SgExclS Sg/DualS go-PfDual shop- All Det big person-Ass
        pe kari o- na-          tapert-er
        Deix 1Sg0 Fut3-1/2Sg0-growl-n Prlmpf
        'I went to the shops with the old man who is always growling me/ I went
        to the shops with the old man; the one always growling me.'","[190, 191]"
"
                                                                           181
       Deictic markers cover a wide range of functions. They are markers which
can contrast or highlight various elements of a sentence or utterance. Those
elements can be referents, events/states or entire propositions. The evidence
presented suggests that they are more discourse sensitive than syntax sensitive.
There is much overlap in function between what is described in many other
languages as switch-reference marking and these deictic markers. When they are
tracking referents, are they not marking these as being the same or different (or
new)? Furthermore, the correlation between temporal relations of switch-
reference systems and that of deictic markers' functions are again quite striking.
Switch-reference markers often indicate a temporal sequential and/ or
simultaneous relation with the previous clause parallel to the deictic markers)
although these often also include a logical relation with the previous clause.
       It can be informally noted that the clauses with deictic markers pa and ga
generally involve a much tighter syntactic linkage with the antecedent clause
than deictic markers pe and ge. There are no instances in the data of pa and ga
occurring with a discourse initial clause. In contrast, markers pe and ge may or
may not occur with a discourse initial clause. Similarly, both markers i and ya can
occur discourse initially but only the marker ya marks a clause where the relation
to its antecedent clause is that of sequence or expressing some kind of logical
relation.","[192, 193]"
"                                                                             172
      There is a restriction on the occurrence of the deictic marker i and the
imperative: that is one can only specify a place in the imperative with the deictic
marker ge. Sentences with i/-y are unacceptable. Consider the following
examples:
(4.110) ma ge ero-e
        2SgA Deix eat- Fut2/3
        'Eat here/ Eat now(?).'
(4.111) ma ge ut           mi-     wpe           da-              wa
        2SgS Deix sleepN 1I2SgS-n PIS be lying n PIS be(person)-Irr
        'Stay asleep here.'
(4.112) *ma i ero
        *ma-y ero
        *ma i ut nawpe dawa
        *ma-y ut nawpe dawa
      Note however that this is not determined by the presence of 2nd person
because in non-imperative sentences in the 2nd person, the deictic marker i is
acceptable (as is the marker ya):
(4.113) ma na-        nyay+nyay i      n(a)- aw-                e      Mer-ge?
        2SgS Q clitic-timeN.      Deix 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Fut2/3 M.I.-Loc
        'How long will you be staying here on Murray?'
(4.114) aka ma i- ko bakyamu-               e      sop-       kak?
        hey 2SgS Deix-again Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 long time-Priv
         'Are you going back again so quickly?'
(4.115) ma nade             ya ut         eydi-          e,
        2SgS where/when Deix sleepN n PIS lie down-Fut2/3
         ka- y       meta d-a-       rp-    e
         1SgA-Deix houseO l-Futl-1 sweep-Futl
         'When you lie down, I will sweep the house.'
       Why should there be such a restriction? Commands are inherently
concerned with getting the addressee to do something which s/he has not yet
been doing (thus a goal orienting effect) or telling him/her to keep on doing
something which s/he has been doing. The inherent goal orientation in the
imperative, may have caused the deictic marker ge to become an overt marker for
the imperative. Note however that the marker ge can never be used when the
goal is at the same place as the speaker, which suggests ge always refers to a place
away from the speaker, at least with a verb of motion. The direction/manner
marker ke(y) must always be used when the speaker is the goal. Consider:
(4.116) ma ke(y) ta- ba
         2SgS way Deix-go
         'Come this way I here.'
         *magetaba                                                                          173
       Yet with a verb of non-motion or a verb of location, the marker ge can be
used to indicate proximity to the speaker:
(4.117) ma ge na-          mri-           e      kari-doge
         2SgS Deix 1 /2SgS-n PIS sit down-Fut2/3 1Sg- Loe
         'Sit down here, close to me.'
(The prefix marker na- on the verb is the S/O cross-reference marker being used
here to indicate close proximity to the speaker so there is no ambiguity as to
where the speaker wants the addressee to be located.)
       It may be that the imperative carries some modal function conveying to the
addressee that something different will/ should/ ought to happen and thus, the
deictic marker that is associated with something different is used. Although no
evidence has been found in the data to account for the restriction in use of deictic
marker ge in the imperative, it should be noted that such a restriction does indeed
exist.5)    i - place associated with remote past
      In the remote past, there is a restriction since only the marker i can be used.
Sentences with the same verbal marking and the deictic marker ge are
unacceptable:
(4.118) e      i    o-        da-               li     Areb-ge

         there was a path at Sebeg.'
         *kikem taym, gab ge waykeredi Sebege.
       Contrast the examples above with those below where non-remote past is
used and the marker i cannot be used (at least in the non-future):
(4.120) e      ge daw-                 er     Korog-e
         3SgS Deix n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf K.-       Loe
         'He was there at Korog.'
(4.121) e i dawer Koroge
         *He was staying there at Korog.
         (good: He will be here at Korog.)

         'I saw him there.' (earlier than today)
         *ka ika abi erdari
                                                                            174
      Note that examples in the present are also unacceptable with the marker i
when these involve perfective marking on the verb:
(4.123) *ka     i- ka      abi erdar-i
        'I saw him there.' (earlier today)
      What is the motivation for the deictic marker i to be associated with the
remote past and for the deictic markers ge and pe to be associated with the past
and present respectively? In the same way as the imperative became obligatorily
used with the deictic marker ge because of its strong semantic orientation to a
goal, the distant past has become obligatorily used with the deictic marker i
because of its strong semantic orientation to a source. In other words, the remote
past locates events with respect to a beginning, the time from which other events
ensue. There is some evidence to support this interpretation since the remote
past frequently occurs only at the beginning of texts thus marking the location as a
source.
      The occurrence of specific deictic markers, namely ge and i with certain
mood and aspectual features of the verb, may be an innovation, a diachronic
change being perceived at the sychronic level. As such, the deviance can be
regarded as an extension of the markers' meanings and functions.","[183, 184, 185, 186]"

        There is an additional pronominal set which functions both as a reflexive/
reciprocal pronoun and as an 'exclusive' pronoun. In the latter function, it
provides information about the will or high level of involvement of the Sor A,
i.e. A or S exclusively. Its meaning is captured by the following paraphrase: by
oneself, by one's own free will, on one's own. It does have a semantic restriction
in that it must be co-referent with the S or A. The forms themselves are derived
from other pronominal forms:
        kababu 'myself, on my own' < ka lSgA/S
        kerbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n SgExcl)' < kerbi ln SgExclO
        merbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n Sglncl)' < merbi ln SglnclO
        mabu 'yourself, on your own (Sg)' <ma 2SgA/S
        wabu 'yourself, on your own (n Sg)' < wa 2n SgA/S
        tababu 'himself, herself, themselves, on his/her/their own (non)Sg'
                                          < taba(ra) 3Gen
        Note that the dual function of this set is parallel to the English pronominal
set with 'self: which can be used for both reflexive/reciprocal events, e.g. I hit
myself, and to mark an exclusive role in the action, e.g. I did it by myself.
        Some examples of the two uses follow:
 (2.252) ma mara meta dimr- i mabu?
          2SgA 2SgGen houseO build-Pf 2SgExcl
          'Did you build your house on your own?'

          (usually said at a feast to encourage people not to be shy and to serve
          themselves)
                                                                             70
(2.255) able koskir-           et tababu able lamar erdar-i
        Det (married)female-SgA 3Excl Det spiritO see- Pf
        'The woman, herself, saw the ghost.'
        (i.e. it was not someone else who saw it)
       The two functions are usually kept distinct because when the pronoun is
being used in a syntactic function (i.e. as a reflexive/reciprocal pronoun), the verb
has the intransitiviser prefix ba-. Thus:
(2.256) ma mabu ba- smer-o
        2SgS 2SgRefl Intr-see- Fut2/3sg
        'See yourself.'
(2.257) ma mabu dasmer-o
        2SgA 2SgExcl see-       Fut2/3sg
         'See for yourself.'
       However, the language is in a state of flux with many speakers using the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as the only signal for reflexive/reciprocal
actions and reserving the pronoun for the exclusive meaning but with the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as well. Thus:
(2.258) werem ba- mri-          da
         childS Intr-sit down-PfSg
         'The child sat himself down.'
(2.259) werem tababu ba- mri-          da
         childS 3Excl Intr-sit down-PfSg
         'The child sat himself down on his own.'
       What seems to be happening is that the presence of the pronoun is
automatically triggering the intransitive form of the verb irrespective of whether
the action is reflexive/reciprocal or not. This change is probably due to the high
frequency of the two meanings of the pronoun (i.e. as both an exclusive marker
and a reflexive/reciprocal marker).
       One can speculate on the origin of this set of pronouns. Ray, in his study
(1907), gives the following set of genitive singular pronouns:
       kaba-ra 1SgGen (>modern: kara)
       maba-ra 2SgGen (>modern: mara)
       taba-ra 3SgGen       (>modern: tabara)
       These may have been the source of the roots of the pronominal set
discussed above. Note that the affix -bu that occurs suffixed to the pronouns,
e.g. kababu 'on my own', might be a particle or it might be derived from the
instrumental nominal suffix -u, e.g. bakir-u 'with a stone'. The consonant may
have been inserted because of two vowels occurring across a morpheme
boundary, e.g. kaba+u ---> kaba-b-u. (Consonant insertion is attested elsewhere
with the instrumental case, e.g. lu 'thing'---> lug-u 'with something'.) The
choice of the bilabial stop insertion could have been due to the presence of a                                                                             71
bilabial stop in the root (except for mabu, *mababu which was affixed to maintain
regularity within the paradigm). Thus, these free-standing pronominal forms
might be derived from the instrumental case but whose meaning is to provide
information about the clause as to the volition or the unique participation of the
A/S.","[80, 81, 82, 83]"

5.8    Periphrastic Constructions.
       Inchoative and causative events are typically expressed periphrastically.
Causative constructions have two verbs: the causing event and the resulting
change of state. Inchoative constructions also have two verbs: an intransitive
activity type verb and the resulting change of state. Let us examine each type in
turn.
       The verbs ikay 'make Sg/DualO' and iker 'make Pauc/PlO' express the
causal part of the event with the A acting upon the 0, and the inchoative verb
expresses the result with the 0 of 'cause' usually the S of 'become' (bay 'Sg/DualS
become' and ber 'Pauc/PlS become'). Here are some examples:
(5.88) wi           na-     ker-          da
         3n SgA 3n SgO-make Pauc/Pl0-PÂ£Pl
         tewpay mir ber-                  da
         short word pauc/ plS become-perfpl
         'They have made the words become short.'
(5.89) kaba- yde abi ikay-                   da ekesmu- da
         banana-A 3Sg0 make Sg/DualO-PfSg split intr.-PfSg
         'The banana (tree) has made it (the pipe) split.'
(5.90) Lez-ide bakir ikay-                 da lawlaw bay-                   da
         L.- A stoneO make Sg/DualO-PfSg tableS Sg/DualS become-PfSg
         'Les made a table out of a stone/ Les made the stone into a table.'
       Causal verbs can occur outside causative constructions meaning 'tell' (with
'word' incorporated into the verb complex) and 'swive' (with the paucal/plural
form of the verb being used which could be an idiomatic use)':
(5.91) kimyar-            ide taba koskir           mir ikay-da
         married man-A 3Gen married femaleO word tell- PfSg

         1SgA 2Sg0 Fut1+1/2Sg0-swive-Fut1
         'I will swi ve you.'
       With inchoative events, there is a clear preference to express it as a
complex event involving an intransitive activity type verb with an S argument
(akay 'Sg/DualS do' and eker 'do') and the inchoative verb (bay 'Sg/DualS
become' and ber 'Pauc/PlS become'). Here are some examples:
 (5.93) e         akay-         da kimyar bay-                da
         3SgS Sg/DualS do-PfSg man         Sg/DualS become-PfSg
          'He has become a man.'

         Sg/DualS do-PastSg stoneS/0/0? Sg/DualS become-PastSg
         'She then changed, turned into a stone.' (D6pem, p218, section25)

         maykeaw wag
         close big wind
         'If the sea turns a deep sea colour (i.e. murky), a big wind (is) nearby.'
        Although little can be said about the precise meaning of the intransitive
verbs 'do', it can be pointed out that these verbs are used to mark the inception of
a process and that they always are intransitive with an S argument and the
second nominal, if there is one, being either a non-syntactic argument or part of
the complex verb phrase:
(5.96) ma nole sirib- ge akay-                   0         2SgS Neg shame-Loe Sg/DualS be-Fut2/3

          Det married manS Deix Det unmarried female lust- Loe do- Prlmpf
          'That man there has started lusting after that girl.'
(Note that the role of the non-S nominal is not understood although it may be
literally: ?That man is doing that girl lust.)
        The forms of the inchoative verbs warrant some discussion as well. Note
the resemblance between these forms, i.e. bay, ber, and the causative and
intransitive 'do' forms, i.e. ikay, iker, and, akay, aker. It may be that the forms are
derived from the transitive verb with the intransitiviser ba- although the
transformation also involves an odd change, namely the loss of the initial vowel
 and consonant.","[207, 208, 209]"

           'I will eat first.'
         For some words, it feels intuitively that the adverbial function is primary
with the secondary function having developed from it. Adverbs such as kikem
'firstly', emetu 'already', mena 'still, continue', etc. Unfortunately, there is no
linguistic evidence to either refute or support such a claim.
         Although it is not possible to isolate these words as being uniquely or even
primarily an adverb, their function is clearly adverbial. Adverbs contribute
information about the manner:
(3.253) ma ta-            ba dudum+dudum
           2SgS Deix-go quick
           'Come quickly.'

               3SgS-Deix already Intr-dig-Pf
            '... (but) he had already buried himself.'
         As can be noted from the examples, adverbs covered in this section do not
have any inflections or affixes. (Adverbial phrases do occur as illustrated in the
section on inflections). Their position is relatively free in the sentence although
they tend not to occur in word initial position.
         Several of the words used adverbially appear in reduplicated form. This
might be done for two reasons. It may be to derive an adverb from a noun, i.e.
 dudum-ge 'in haste' (lit: haste-Loe), dudum+dudum 'quickly'; nyay-em 'forever'
 (lit: long time-All), nyay+nyay 'eternally'. Note that since this parallels
 reduplicated forms for adjectives, reduplication could be viewed as a syntactic                                                                            144
process for deriving nouns into modifiers, be they adjectives or adverbs.
However, somewhat similar to adjectives, reduplicated adverbs also imply a
greater intensity, i.e. mayk-e 'dose-by' (lit: close-Loe) versus mayk+mayk 'very
dose-by'. Thus, reduplication is both a syntactic and semantic process for adverbs
as well.","[154, 155, 156]"
"Interrogative/Indefinite Pronouns.
      There is a set of interrogative words used with non-polar questions such as
nete 'who', netim 'to who, for who', nade 'when, where', nalug-lam 'why, from
what', etc. Within this set are included: nade 'when, where~ which is used to
introduce a temporal or spatial adverbial clause, and nako 'what (to do)~ which is
used to introduce an activity clause. Interrogative words follow a case marking
pattern similar to nouns, an ergative-absolutive pattern, i.e. A versus S/O for
non-humans, and a three way split, i.e. A, S and 0 for humans.
      The interrogative/indefinite pronominal paradigm is as follows:
                                nete 'who'        nalu 'what'
A                               net-ide           nalug-ide

Instrumental                                      nalug-u     Some of the interrogative words cannot be broken down into morphemes
and must be listed in the lexicon. These include:
      nete 'who'
      nade 'when, where'
      nako 'what'
     Other words are formed by the interrogative proclitic na-. For example:
      na-lu 'what' (lit: Q clitic-thing)
      na-ged-ge 'where' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-Loe)
      na-ged-im (-nagadim) 'where to' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-All)
      na-nyay+nyay 'how long (in time)' (lit: Q clitic-time N)
      na-war-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-length of time-Loe)
      na-kerker-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-point in time-Loe)
      na-piri 'how long (in space)' (lit: Q clitic-length)
      na-urut-ge 'what year' (lit: Q clitic-year-Loc)
                                                                           72
       Interrogative pronouns typically occur at the beginning of a sentence or
immediately following a sentence-initial pronoun. Examples to illustrate
interrogatives, their position and their inflections follow:
(2.260) net- ide keriba            lewer ays-          li?
         who-A ln SgExclGen foodO carry Pauc/PlO-Primpf
         'Who is taking our food?' (D6pem, p217, section13)

         3SgA Q clitic-thing-Instr 3Sg0 hit- Pf
          'What did he hit him with?'
        There is no distinction between A, S or 0 for nonsingular interrogative
pronouns. Thus:
        neti-de       'who A (Sg)'

        The interrogative pronoun with the ergative plural case marking does not
exist, i.e. *nete-gize. However, the interrogative word formed by the question
clitic and the word le 'person' does have an A plural form and an S plural form
(the plural S form is not acceptable to all speakers):
(2.267) na-       le-     lut? (\el\..\t:.1fre~ular-{ormof le.''pef""Son'+et~68A"")
        Q clitic-person-SgA
        'who A (sg)?'
(2.268) na-     le-     gize?
        Q clitic-person-plA
        'who A (pl)?'","[83, 84]"
"1)     The nonsingular suffix -iba/-ibi is added to a singular noun in a complex
phrase to indicate that it is a member of a group of two or more. For example:
(2.91) kari       omay-iba mari omay-ey wi              ba- reg-        ley
        1SgGen dog- n Sg 2SgGen dog- Dual 3n SgS Intr-bite flesh-nPrlmpfDual
        'My dog and your dog, they bit each other.'
(2.92) wi         Sigar-iba na-     rdar-dare omaskir-kem
        3n SgA S.-     n Sg 3n SgO-see- Pauc children-Ass
        'They saw Sigar along with his children.'
         (?They, Sigar and his children, got seen.)
       As exemplified in the two sentences given above (2.91 and 2.92), -iba
merely indicates one of a group of two or more. There are no instances of this
suffix occurring with inanimate nouns. Could this be because speakers are less
interested in number reference with inanimates? Typically, with inanimate
objects, the nouns are simply juxtaposed:
(2.93) e       tabara sarik kep- kem giz- ge irm-                        i
         3SgA 3Gen bow arrow-Ass trunk-Loe stick Pauc/PlO into-Pf
         'He stuck his bow along with his arrow into the base of the tree.'
         (Dewmer, p209, sections)
       There is one example (2.94.) collected with -iba suffixed onto an inanimate
noun but it is an example collected through elicitation and the genitive case is
used within the complex phrase, a feature which is not normally permitted:
(2.94) ?ma kara          sogob- iba masis-ey na-          rapey-           0          2SgA 1SgGen ciggies-n Sg <Eng- Dual 3n SgO-buy Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
         'Buy my cigarettes and matches.'
       The -iba suffix has been classified as an inflection for the following reasons:                                                                              46
â¢       The apparent restriction against the genitive case co-occurring with it in its
full form (excluding the example just given above). This is a restriction parallel
to that for inflections:
(2.95) taba koskir-                  iba omasker-kem
         3Gen (married)female-n Sg children- Ass
         'his wife along with his children'
(2.96) *taba-ra koskir-iba omasker-kem
                  Gen
â¢       A distinction in the form when affixed to a noun in a non-syntactic case,
namely -ibi. Thus, there are basically two forms for this affix: -iba for syntactic
cases and -ibi for non-syntactic cases. Here are some examples with the form -ibi:
(2.97) ka bakyamu- da Sigar-ibi uteb- em omasker-kem
         lSgS Sg/DualS go-PfSg S.-        n Sg place-All children-Ass
         'I went to Sigar and his children's place.'
(Note that in the above example 2.97, the -ibi phrase seems to be in a genitive case
function which could be interpreted as evidence of the genitive's fluid status as a
syntactic or non-syntactic case.)
(2.98) ... pa- ka ta- ba Irwered-ge Mesnare-ybi- (i)m Eydyana-ey
               Deix-lsgS Deix-go I.-      Loe M.-       n Sg-All E. -     Dual
         da-ra-         bger-i
            I -3n Sg0-1 call- Pf
         ' ... and then, I came to Irwered, to Mesnare and Eydyana's and invited
         them.'
(2.99) Bewr pe eypu- ge irdi                      Webok-ibi- lam a       Babud-ey
         B. S Deix middle-Loe n PIS be(place) W.-          n Sg-Abl Conj B.-     Dual
          'Bewr is half-way between Webok and Badud.'
        There is no distinction between the A, S or 0 argument when the
nonsingular inflection is affixed. Thus, one can use this suffix with an A
argument (2.100) or with an S argument (2.101):
(2.100) Lez-iba koskir-                 ey lewer ti- dikasr-eyey
         L. - n Sg (married)female-Dual foodO Deix-cook- PrlmpfDual
          'Les and his wife are cooking (there).'
 (2.101) Lez-iba kosker-                ey ta- bakyamu- daryey
          L.- n Sg (married)female-Dual Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfDual
          'Les and his wife came.'
        There is some ambiguity caused by this lack of distinction. With an
 intransitive verb, there will only be one core argument so the -iba phrase will
 have to be S. With a transitive verb, the non-iba phrase will either have an overt
 ergative case marker for A or it will be marked overtly for 0 if it is a pronoun or a
 proper noun. The only instance where it will be ambiguous is when a common
 noun is the 0 as this will be the -0 case marker with no way of distinguishing 0                                                                             47
from A. Of course, word order can always be used to disambiguate. Here is an
example where the overt 0 case marker on the personal pronoun allows the
addressee to interpret the -iba phrase as the A:
(2.102) neti- (i)ba yabi ne-      rwer-da?
         who-n Sg 3n Sg 3n Sg0-teach-PÂ£Pl
         'Who(pl) taught them?'
       There is some diachronic and synchronic evidence which suggests that the
suffix -iba is related to the pronominal plural genitive case form (see section 2.3
p68 on Pronouns for more details). The nonsingular genitive pronominal forms
which are relevant to this discussion are:
1n Sg Exel keriba
       Incl meriba
2n Sg          waba
3n Sg          wiyaba I yaba
       The nonsingular forms which all end in -(i)ba correspond closely in form
as well as in function to the nominal nonsingular affix -iba.
       In addition, Ray in his study (1893) gives the following examples to indicate
a pair or a group:
(2.103) keriba           Pasi-ey bakyamu-        ley      Dawar-em
         1n SgExclGen P.- Dual Sg/DualS go-PastDual D.-          All
         'We (exd dual), Passi and I, went to Dawar.'(lbid; 61)
         (the glosses are my own)
(2.104) mi          merbi-      tkem na-     mri-                da
         1n Sglnd ln SglndO-Ass      1/2Sg?-Sg/DualS sit down-PfSg
         'We sat down in one another's company/You sat down along with us.'(?)
         (Ibid; 64)
       Although there are no examples in Ray's data of this construction being
used with nominals such as those given for modern Meryam Mir, the reader
should note that in at least one of Ray's examples, the plural genitive pronoun is
used to indicate the plural pair. This parallels the examples found in the present-
day language where the -iba is affixed to nominals for similar effect.
       The earlier Meryam Mir examples both differ and resemble modern
Meryam Mir with regard to pronominals. Like the earlier form of the language, a
nonsingular pronoun is required in this construction:
(2.105) ki            ama- ey bakyamu- daryey
         1n SgExdS mother-Dual Sg/DualS go-PfDual
          'We two, mother and I, went.'
(2.106) wi        ama- ypkem na-         mr-                eder
         3n SgS mother-Ass       3n SgS-Pauc/PlS be seated-n Prlmpf
          'They were seated, him along with the mothers.'
       Note that if there is possession, it must be with the reduced form:                                                                            48
(2.107) ki         kerbi       ama- yey

       'we two, our mother and I'

            ln SgExclGen
       * keriba amayey
       'we two, mother and I'2)     The privative suffix -kak is added to (pro)nominals to indicate the absence
or the lack of something:
(2.108) e       bar-       kak mir dike
        3SgS crookedN-Priv word n PIS be(word)
        'That is the right word.'
         (lit: it is a word without crookedness)
(2.109) e       sirib- kak werem da-                  Ii
        3SgS shame-Priv child n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'He is a shameless child.'

         lSgS Neg sleepN-Priv 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'I am not sleepy.'
         (lit: I am without sleep)
       It can be used with pronouns or animate nouns as well to denote their
absence at a particular place:
(2.111) nole abi- tkak meta- ge irdi-                 redi
         Neg 3Sg0-Priv house-Loe n SgS be(place)-Pr
         'He was not there at the house.'
         (lit: There/It is without him at the house)
       When it occurs within a noun phrase, it must precede the head noun and
the stem will operate in an adjectival or attributive function. As such, it might be
considered a derivation. For example:
(2.112) able mir- kak newr-                    ide abi ep-          Ii
         Det word-Priv unmarried female-A 3Sg0 carry Sg/DualO-Primpf
         'The quiet silent girl is carrying him.'
       Nominalised verbs can also be used with this affix:
(2.113) ese ma aspir- kak apu             a      bab
         if 2SgS marryN-Priv mother Conj father
         ma n(a)- a-                     Ii...

          'If you are an unmarrried mother or father .. .'","[57, 58, 59, 60]"
"                                                                            169

           'The ghost's noise was (heard) travelling away.'
           (i.e. it was heard travelling away from the location of the main
           protagonist)
          Contrast the above examples with the following where the marker ge is
    used implying movement to or towards a location, i.e. a goal marker, although
    the goal can never coincide with the speaker:
    (4.93) able lamar-ira burner ge ti- ditimd-                  i
           Det spirit- Gen noises Deix Deix-travel of noise?-Pr-Pf?
            'The ghost's noise was (heard) travelling towards him.'
            (i.e. it was heard travelling towards the location of the main protagonist)

            lSgS Deix-lSgS Futl-go
            'I will go there.' (correct translation?)
          As evidence that the marker i is associated with the source, consider the
    following example where its occurrence with an ablative phrase is acceptable but
    unacceptable with an allative noun phrase:
    (4.96) mi            1- mi             na- bakyaw-       dere     uteb-lam
            1n SginclS Deix-ln SginclS Futl-Pauc/PlS go-FutlPauc place-Ahl
            'We (incl) will now go from this place.'
            *mi 1-mi na-bakyaw-dere uteb-em
                                               All
          The spatial notion can be extended to a temporal notion.    4)     i - future (punctual)/nonimperative
           The marker i can also be used to mean 'from this point in time (onwards)'.
    One can see from the translations given in the following examples that the spatial
    use is extended in time where movement away from a place is parallel to events
'   moving away from now. Consider:
I   (4.97) Abob a          Kos, wiyaba    ad    1- ka d-a-      tawt-e
             A.      Conj K., 3n SgGen storyO Deix-lSgA 1-Futl- I tell- Futl
              'I will from now on tell Abob and Kos' story.'
    (4.98) ka         abi 1-     ka a- rdar-e
              lSgA 3Sg0 Deix-lSgA Futl-see- Futl
              'I will see him from now on.'
           It is unclear whether it is the same homophonous reduced morpheme or
    clitic -y attached to pronominals that is used with the meaning 'at that point in                                                                               170
time'. (It could possibly be glossed as 'from that point in time'.) With nominals,
the form ya (rather than i) tends to be used although the correlation might simply
be due to the lack of acoustic salience when -y is used. Here are some examples
with pronouns:
(4.99) ese ka na- bakyamu-              lu      pamas-em
         if lSgS Futl-Sg/DualS go-FutlSg shop- All
         ka-     y     mara siga        ta- ra- pey-             lu
         lSgA-Deix 2SgGen ciggieO Deix-Futl-buy Sg/DualO-FutlSg
         'If I go to the shops, I will buy your cigarettes.'
(4.100) aka ma- y          bakyamu- s           awgog-       em?
         hey 2SgS-Deix Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 big climbN-All
         'Are you going up to the hill?'
(4.101) nako e-        y     o- bakyamu- B              T.1.-em?
         what 3SgS-Deix Fut3-Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 T.1.-All
         'Is he going to T.I?'
       This marker is not obligatory although clearly preferred in some instances.
Thus, in conditional/hypothetical sentences, it tends to occur whereas with
interrogatives, it may or may not be present. The shared meaning of i and -y
seems to be as a future marker but how is this use related to its use as a source
marker? These two functions do have one feature in common, namely that the
future marker i occurs with events that are either temporally or spatially close
and the source marker i must be, by definition, closer to the deictic centre, the
place of the speech act than the goal.
       The distinction between its spatial and temporal use is not discrete and this
may be a contributing factor to the disagreement amongst speakers as to the
suitability and acceptability of sentences when i has future spatial reference.
       For some speakers, the marker i can only be used to indicate a general area
close-by and/ or it involves an event in the immediate future. Thus, the
following sentence is unacceptable as it overtly marks distance away from the
speech act with the verbal deictic t(V)-:
 (4.102) *ka i-         ka ta- ra- mri-                 lu
            lSgS Deix-lSgS Deix-Futl-n PIS sit down-FutlSg
          'I will sit down away from here.'
       When it is 1st or 2nd person, distance away from the speech act must be
 expressed with the deictic markers ge or ya:
 (4.103) ka ge- ka ta- ra- mri-                       lu
          lSgS Deix-lSgS Deix-Futl-n PIS sit down-FutlSg

          1SgS Deix-1SgS Deix-Futl-n PIS sit down-FutlSg
          'I will sit down over there.'","[180, 181, 182]"
"Remote Past.
       The remote past is used to mark events that happened a long time ago. It
represents a broad temporal category and aspectual meanings are conveyed by a
combination of the prefix wa- and various suffixes.
The remote past is marked by the prefix and the past suffix:
(3.150) ab-       korep e     we-       t- eper-e
        former-type 3SgS RemPast-Deix-fly- PastSg
        'Like before, she flew (to the place).' (D6pem, p217, section15)
The remote past imperfective is marked by the prefix and the present
(imperfective) suffixes:
(3.151) able tonar e        wa-       yke-li
        Det habitO 3SgA RemPast-do- Primpf
        'She did (it) this way.' (D6pem, p217, section15)
(3.152) able tonar wa-          yrdi-               (redi)
        Det habitS RemPast-n PIS be(time, place)-Pr
        'The same thing happened (there).' (D6pem, p217, section14)
The remote past perfective is marked by the prefix and the perfective suffix:
(3.153) ebur wa-            ta- bakamu-         da w-        egimu- da
         animal RemPast-Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg RemPast-land- PfSg

         'The bird came, landed, changed; (as) a woman, (she) went there and took
         all the food.' (D6pem, p217, section15)
       There is no past irrealis in the remote past or rather there is no distinction
between the remote past perfective and the past irrealis. Such a collapse is
understandable if one considers that events in the remote past are so distant in                                                                           120
time that it is not possible to comment on what might or could have happened.
For this reason, the past irrealis mood is redundant and the marker is used to
signal remote past perfective.
        The reader should not assume from the description of the remote past that
it is a tense used frequently. In fact, it is probably falling into disuse with speakers
preferring the more recent tenses even in narratives concerned with events in
the remote past. Only one text was collected in which the remote past was used
throughout a story and even then, there was a switch half-way to the past:
(3.154) netat aw koskir                  e    o-        da-               Ii

        Most narratives involving events which happened a long time ago begin
the story with the remote past and then switch immediately to the past:

          'One day, in the middle of the monsoon season, a man and his daughter

      Why should it be the same prefix wa- recurring in these functions: i.e
future 3rd person, past irrealis, remote past? There is a thread binding all these
together. The future is often realised in many languages as the irrealis mood
because events concerned with the future are, by their very nature, uncertain.
Thus, there is a link between the future and the irrealis. In Meryam, future
events involving 3rd person may be the least certain events because the
participant is frequently absent from the speech act place and it involves someone
which neither speaker nor addressee have direct control over. Given that 3rd
person future expresses the greatest degree of uncertainty, it is the same
                                                                               121
morpheme which is used to express past irrealis events and those so far removed
in time that they could be regarded as irrealis events themselves.
       Why should the past irrealis and remote past be more closely related in
meaning to the 3rd person future marker than the irrealis noncommittal? The
irrealis noncommittal is concerned with the attitude of the speaker: I don't want
to say this will happen, I don't want to say this won't happen. In Meryam, such
an attitude is inappropriate with the past, be it irrealis or remote, as it deals with
events that have already happened or events that should or could have
happened but did not occur. The speaker would be essentially saying: I know
what happened but I don't want to say. Such a meaning is not part of the
message when the past irrealis or remote past are used and consequently, the
irrealis noncommittal is unsuitable for past (realised or non-realised) events.
       Nonetheless, the forms of the future 3rd marker and that of the irrealis
noncommittal are clearly related, the unmarked/singular form of the latter being
homophonous with the former. These can probably be traced to a single
historical source. The different functions of the prefix/ suffix wa, i.e. irrealis
noncommittal, past irrealis, remote past and 3rd person future, are linked
together as they all deal in one way or another about what the speaker thinks is or
wants to say is the degree of certainty of the event's realisation.","[131, 132, 133]"
"Irrealis Non-committal.
       This marker is used for events where their realisation or continuation is
uncertain. It is also used sometimes by speakers to be polite, not wishing to
assume that an event, involving the addressee, definitely will (continue to)
happen. It is restricted to events with 2nd or 3rd person participants since these
are potentially less certain than events with the speaker, i.e. 1st person, which are
more certain (at least from the speaker's point of view) and cannot carry an
irrealis non-committal mood. When this mood is used, there is often an
additional component of desire on behalf of the speaker or of someone else in
wanting the event to (continue to) happen and that the event will be good.
       Consider the following examples contrasting future with irrealis:
(3.129) debe le                nole inner-kak wa- yrdi
         good person/ones Neg rain- Priv Fut3-n PIS be(time,place)

         'I hope that it will not rain for the tombstone opening.'
         (translation given by the speaker)
(3.131) ma ut na-                wpe       daw-    o
         2SgS sleep 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS lien PIS be-Fut2/3
         'Remain sleeping.'
(3.132) ma ut         na-        wpe       daw- (w)a
         2SgS sleep 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS lien PIS be-Irr
         'Could you please remain asleep.'
       In these examples, there is a contrast between the future (3.129 and 3.131)
and irrealis (3.130 and 3.132) with regard to the speaker's attitude. In the irrealis,
the speaker indicates his/her desire for the event to happen or continue
happening. In 3.132, the irrealis indicates the speaker's desire to be polite in not                                                                             115
wanting to say whether the event will happen or not although it is dear from the
context that the speaker wants the event to happen and thinks it will be good.
The irrealis examples can be tentatively explicated as follows:
               I don't want to say it will happen/ go on happening
               I don't want to say it won't happen/won't go on happening
               I can't do it or stop it happening
               (I want- you want- other people want something)
               (I think- you think- other people think it will be good)
       In some examples, the event is both desired by and beneficial to the
speaker:
(3.133) ese ka nole na- kyam- lu 3 klok wa- yrpey-                          o,

         'If I am not awake (when) 3 o'clock strikes, then you should wake me up.'
       In some examples, the event is desired only by the speaker but beneficial to
the addressee:

         'Stand clear of me in case of something going wrong.'
         (This was said by someone about to chop down a tree to warn the person
         to stay clear in case the blade might fly off.)
(3.135) ese ma idim-           ge baka, ma baka lu            imu-        wa,
         if 2SgS morning-Loe go             2SgS go thingO hit for noise-Irr

          'If you go in the morning, go and should you strike something which

          (This example was said by an old woman to someone in their dream to
          help them find the right bit of wood.)
        In some examples, the event is neither beneficial nor desired by the speaker
or addressee but by another person (such as in the phrase below ese legize mari
bawru onaskawem 'if people should try and spear you' where the spearing is
desired and would benefit only the spearers, not the speaker nor addressee):
(3.136) ma baka baraygi-o              ge na-            w-             (w)a karem- ge

        ese le-      gize mari bawr-u        o- na-      sk-   awem,

         'Go, dive in (and) stay there in the deep sea. H people should try to spear
        you with their spear, then you should try and break their spear.'
         (This was said by a mother to her child urging him to dive into the water
         and break the spears of those who try and spear him.)
       In the following example, the event is neither beneficial nor desirable for
the speaker, only for the addressee:
(3.137) wa        na- lug- lam
         2n SgS Qclitic-thing-Abl
         wa      baka lar dipomde daw-                   (w)a?
         2n SgS go fishO feel           n Pl?S be(person)-Irr
         'Why should you go fondling the fish?'
         (where the speaker is addressing a group of women that he asked to help
         him cook a fish but does not want them to know that the fish is a young
       boy)
       In this example, the irrealis marker is used as a kind of warning. The
speaker does not want to say that the event is happening and so, he uses the
irrealis marker. This illustrates another important feature of the irrealis marker.
The irrealis is never used with yes/no questions nor non-polar interrogatives as
the presupposition in the speaker's mind is that something will happen or is
happening. Thus, below, in 3.138, the speaker assumes the addressee is staying
for a while and is asking for more information about the period of the stay. It
would be inappropriate to use the irrealis marker suggesting that the addressee
was not staying. Similarly in the other example below, 3.139, the speaker must be
thinking that there is some suggestion or possibility that the addressee will be
staying and so the irrealis marker would imply the converse:
(3.138) ma na-        nyay+nyay i         n-        aw-              0     Mer-ge?
         2SgS Q clitic-long time N Deix 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS be(person)-Fut2/3 M.- Loe
         'How long will you be staying on Murray Island?'
         *ma na-nyay+nyay i n-aw-(w)a Mer-ge?
(3.139) aka ma i         n-         aw-              0      Mer-ge?
         hey 2SgS Deix 1/2Sg/P1S-n PIS be(person)-Fut2/3 M.- Loe
         'Will you be staying on Murray Island?'
         *aka ma i n-aw-(w)a Mer-ge?
        When the irrealis marker is used with reference to 2nd person, it is
frequently used as a politeness form. Speakers often explain such sentences as the
speaker giving permission to the addressee, i.e. any time you like do it. It is
 probably for this reason that the irrealis marker has been described by Ray as the                                                                            117
form of the imperative used when the speaker will be absent. When it is being
used as a form of politeness, the time reference is not specified for the immediate
and hence interpretation of its meaning in terms of the speaker's absence is
plausible and accounted for. Here are some examples of its use as a politeness
form:
(3.140) ma mena n-             aw-               (w)a
         2SgS still 1/2Sg/PIS-n PIS be(person)-Irr
         'Do stay here/ You should stay longer/ You could stay longer.'
         (often used by speakers as a polite way of bidding farewell)
(3.141) ma na-           mi              da-                wa
         2SgS 1 /2Sg/PIS-n PIS be sitting n PIS be(person)-Irr
         'Do stay seated.'

         'Should you be (back) in your country, could you send (us) your good
         thoughts.'
       A feature of the irrealis marker which warrants further investigation is the
frequent occurrence with conditional sentences, both in the condition and the
consequent. Is the irrealis marker used to indicate a lesser degree of certainty? Is
it used to indicate an overt lack of commitment to its realisation on behalf of the
speaker? If one compares sentences with and without the irrealis, the contrast lies
in the degree of certainty of the events:
(3.143) nade ma abi erdar-0,              ma abi detager-0
         when 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Fut2/3 2SgA 3Sg0 tell-            Fut2/3
         'When you see him, tell him.'
(3.144) ese ma abi erdar-0,            ma abi detager-0
         if 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Fut2/3 2SgA 3Sg0 tell-           Fut2/3
         'If you see him, you tell him.'
(3.145) ese ma abi erdar-wa, ma abi detager-wa
         if 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Irr 2SgA 3Sg0 tell-          Irr
         'If you should see him, you could tell him.'
         *nade ma abi erdar-wa, ma abi detager-wa
       The incompatibility of the temporal phrase marker nade 'when' and the
irrealis noncommittal suggests it does indeed carry a lesser degree of certainty. It
may also be suggesting that the speaker does not want to say whether something
will happen or not. This interpretation of the irrealis noncommittal is supported
by non-conditional sentences with 3rd person where the irrealis noncommittal
marker indicates that the speaker will not say whether something will happen or
not:                                                                          118

                                  INTRODUCTION1.     The Language and its Speakers.
       Meryam Mir is one of three languages spoken in the Torres Strait, that
stretch of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea (see Kmao lh.
                                                                       !Ca.klw a.Wo.w d J
on p. iv). The other two languages are Kala Lagaw Ya (also known ast\1(alaw
Lagaw Langgus, Mabuiag or Yagar Yagar, see Kennedy 1985 and Ford and Ober
1987; 1), which is spoken on the Western islands, and Torres Strait Creole (also
known as Broken, Pizin, Big Thap, Blaikman or Ailan Tok, see Shnukal, 1988; 3)
which is the lingua franca of the region. Meryam Mir was spoken throughout
the Eastern islands of Erub (Darnley Island), Ugar.(Stephen Island) and Mer
(Murray Island). However, with the ever-increasing use of Creole, Meryam Mir
has been seriously impinged upon and, as a consequence, it is being spoken less
and less in these communities. The number of speakers are estimated to be
approximately 700 (Wurm, 1977; 328)1 which presumably includes Eastern Torres
Strait Islanders living on other islands of the Torres Strait and on the mainland
of Australia in cities such as Townsville, Cairns or Mackay.
       The name itself, Meryam Mir, is drawn from the word mir meaning 'word,
language' and from the name of one of the clans living on Mer, the Meryam
people (from Mer 'Murray Island' and the morpheme -(y)am '(?)of a clan, of a
place'). It frequently appears in the literature written as Miriam or Meriam (Mir)
but to be consistent with the orthography used in this study, Meryam (Mir) is
chosen.
       Meryam Mir has an agglutinating morphology employing both prefixes
and suffixes. Its word order is basically A-0-V or S-V with the verb always in
word final position but with variation on the arguments' order depending on
pragmatic features. It has an extensive system of cross-reference markers on the
verb coding information about the number, person and syntactic nature of the
arguments as well as case inflections suffixed on nouns to indicate their syntactic
function within a clause. Thus, Meryam Mir can be regarded in typological
terms as a double-marking language (Nichols 1986; 72).","[11, 12]"
"Clause Relators.
      Items in this closed class serve to link two syntactic elements together.
These might be two phrases or two clauses (and in the case of the conjunction a,                                                                                30
this can also be two words). Little can be said about relators without a full study
of the types of clause linkage. There will be no discussion about them and they
are simply listed with an example of each in the chapter on basic syntax. Note
that deictic markers are also used in this category or rather exploited in this
category to link two syntactic units together.","[41, 42]"
"5.9   Clause Relators.
      We saw in the section on deictic markers that these sometimes fulfill a
function parallel to that fulfilled by subordinate (relative) clause markers in other
languages. One of the main differences is the lack of syntactic dependency
between the two clauses although there is often intonational dependency                                                                             198
between the two. In addition, there are several clause relaters which overtly
signal a semantically subordinate relationship between the clause in which they
occur and the main clause. The verb in the subordinate clause, however, has full
inflectional markings, i.e. it is finite. Here are some of the relaters and an
example of each:
temporal clause relaters:

        'Flatten it so that it becomes really flat.'
       Some of the clause relators have other functions which do not mark a
dependent clause. For example, kewbu can either serve to introduce a temporal
dependent clause meaning 'after' or it can be used as an adverb meaning 'later,
behind':
(5.112) ka na- ba kewbu
        lSgS Futl-go later
        'I will go later /behind.'
       Clause relators can be distinguished from their other functions because
they always occur at the beginning of the clause (except when there is a pronoun
which can precede it).
       There is also a co-ordinating conjunction a 'and, or' which can link two
words, phrases or clauses together. This may be a borrowing from English 'and':
(5,113) ese ma aspir- kak apu
        if 2SgS marryN-Priv mother

         (from the tape made for Social Security by Mabo, S.)
       A number of the clause relators can combine with each other providing
there is no conflict in meaning. A full description of the relators syntactic and
functional role within the clause or sentence awaits further study.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"

                                                                            152
       What evidence is there for claiming these markers are marking the goal and
not say, the place or source? Example 4.22 was unacceptable when the marker ge
was used with an overt ablative phrase and acceptable with 4.21 with an overt
allative phrase:
(4.21) mi           ge- mi           na- bakyaw-        dere     uteb- em
        1n SglnclS Deix-1n SglnclS Fut1-Pauc/PlS go-FutPauc place-All
        'We few will go to a place.'
(4.22) *mi ge-mi na-bakyaw-dere uteb-lam
                                          Abl
       Given the unacceptability of the marker ge with the ablative phrase (and
presumably the same result would occur with pe although this remains to be
tested) and given that these markers occur with verbs of motion, one can
conclude that they refer to a goal. (See the later section on i where the converse is
true; that is the marker i can co-occur with an ablative phrase but not with an
allative phrase.)3)    pe, ge - focus on new I different event/ state
      There are examples in the data where the markers pe and ge can sometimes
be glossed as 'now' or 'then', which suggests a temporal meaning. However, they
may be indicating to the addressee to focus on the event itself because it was not
occurring before. Neither interpretation is incompatible with the other. They
could be explicated as:
      something is happening/happened;
      before this time, it was not happening
      at this time, it is happening/happened.
      Consider:

        'Another day, he went off, he went (and) speared a fish; he kept spearing
        fish and then putting them onto the rocks.'
      The temporal meaning assigned to these markers does not exclude them
from carrying simultaneously spatial meanings as well. One can see from the
examples given above that it is sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to assign a
spatial or temporal meaning to them exclusively. Such is the case in the
following example:
(4.29) ka pe- ka n(a)- a-                         Ii
        lSgS Deix-lSgS 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
        'It is me here now.'
        (This was said by someone who had just arrived at a new place and was
        introducing himself to a friend of his father's i.e. new place and/or focus
        on new event.)4)     pe, ge - focus on new I different referent
       The markers pe and ge can also be used to focus on a new referent or to
reintroduce an established referent. This is sometimes done to overtly contrast
one referent with another but at other times, the opposition is, or seems to be,
only implied between one referent and a set of other potential referents. Whether
this latter case is one of its functions or merely an inference is not something
which can be proved with the current corpus of data. To illustrate its use, consider
the following examples:
(4.30) na-        ged newr pe da-                   Ii?
         Q clitic-land girlS Deix n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'What island is that girl from?'
         (talking about an island girl that has just come into their field of vision

         (example from: Kudub, K., Gerip-sik, Ngali Dec. 1984)

      Although the time when the language changed predates the time of the
speech utterance, the present deictic marker is used because the language remains
different to this day.2)    pa, ga - focus on same referent
      There are examples where the deictic markers pa and ga maintain focus on
the same referent. The use of the term 'same referent' is used for a semantic/
discourse-based notion rather than a syntactic-based one. As details of complex
sentence structures are documented and analysed, it may emerge that features
such as langu~ge pivot and types of subordinating structures will have a bearing
on the postulated meaning of the pa/ ga construction. However, as a preliminary
note, it can be stated that the deictic markers depend upon a semantic notion of
referent. Sentences, where the shared referent is in fact a syntactic argument, will
be pointed out to the reader and the possibility of analysing such constructions as
syntactically motivated will be explored following the pertinent examples:
(4.57) wi        baka say          dirbir-             iyey;
         3n SgS go rock wallO build (by piling up)-PfDual

         'They(2) went (and) built the rock wall; they started at Teker, they built the
         rock wall from Teker as far as Korog (where) it juts out and so that same
         rock wall is still standing because of their building endeavours.'
       The deictic marker pa is focussing on the same referent namely the 0 of the
verb dfrbir 'build' and the S of the verb dararbir 'be built'. The clause mena
Korog ewpamada which intervenes between the two clauses containing the same
referent say may in the light of further data be analysed as a subordinate structure
and so, the deictic marker pa could in this example be regarded as marking as
same referent, a syntactic argument and as operating across clauses.

"2.1    Parts of Speech.
       The following parts of speech need to be distinguished:
Nouns
Verbs
Adjectives
Pronouns
Adverbs
Deictic Markers
Clause Relators
Exclamations/InterjectionsNouns.
        Nouns are an open word class including both concrete or abstract nouns.
Concepts such as hunger, thirst, fatness and width are expressed in the language
as nouns; for example, 6mar 'good feeling', weku 'anger', werer 'hunger', nyap
'thirst', dob 'fatness', deg 'width', piri 'height', new 'ripeness, blister', kiris
'rawness'. This class of words is inflected for case through suffixes. Within this
class, a distinction needs to be drawn between common nouns, which inflect by
distinguishing A from S/O,and proper nouns, which inflect differently for all
three cases. There are many compound nouns formed with either two nouns,
e.g. kerim le 'boss' (kerim 'head' and le 'person'), or a nominalized verb and
noun, e.g. aro+aro tup 'sardines' (< ero 'eat'+ tup 'sardine').",[40]
"5.5.1 Interrogatives.
      There are two types of interrogatives in the language. One type for polar
questions and another type for non-polar questions.
      Polar questions have the same form as declaratives but with rising
intonation at the end of the utterance to indicate a question:
(S.64) ma- y       kari-m paret dirup- o?
        2SgA-Deix lSg- All dirt sweep-Fut2/3
        'Will you sweep for me?'
(S.65) ma suga        dikri- o?
        2SgA <EngO throw-Fut2/3
        'Have you put in sugar?
       Non-polar questions require an interrogative pronoun or clitic inserted at
the beginning of the utterance. The form of the interrogative depends on what is
being questioned (see the section on Interrogative Pronouns, p72). Although
these typically occur at the beginning, they can follow a pronoun:
(S.66) ma nalu ike-li?
         2SgA whatO do- Prlmpf
         'What are you doing?'",[203]
"
                                                                       183
4.    A transitive verb with an A and 0 argument (either explicit or implicit):

(5.10) ka uteb [lumi dikris- i]
        lSgA placeO weed scrape-Pf
        'I cleared the place.'
5.    A di-transitive verb with an A and two 0 arguments:
(5.11) ka      abi bawr ikwar-                i
        lSgA 3Sg0 spearO give Sg/DualO-Pf
        'I gave him a spear.'

        lSgA 3Sg0 bookO show Sg/DualA/0-PfSg
        'I showed him the book.'
      In addition, clauses may be extended by a number of peripheral adjuncts.
These include instrumental and comitative phrases, locational and temporal
phrases:
(5.13) ka ekyam- da ut- lam
        lSgS wake up-PfSg sleep-Abl
        'I woke up from (being) asleep.'

        lSgA ointment-Instr rub-       Pf
        'I rubbed it with ointment.'
      Clause types 1. and 2. will first be examined. Clause types 3. to 5. that is
intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs will only be discussed in the
context of determining which of their arguments are syntactic and which are
non-syntactic, and whether the verb's valency is fixed or with some variation.
Problems of this nature arise from the fact there are complex verb phrases in the
language and that not all arguments need be overtly expressed. Special attention
will be paid to cross-reference markers to show their role in this area.","[194, 195]"

        The temporal reference of nonpresent sometimes appears to also include
the present when referring to habitual events and probably means something
like: it is always this way and will always be this way. It might also be indicating
that it is not occurring at the time of the speech act but does indeed happen, i.e. a
kind of present irrealis. For example:
(3.93) Lez w- ekyam-dar-er                gayr idim-      ge idim      kakar- ge
          L.S Fut3-get up- ?- n Prlmpf many morning-Loe morning Intens-Loc

(The discussion of the morpheme/root form -dar- will be delayed until the end of
the section outlining the meanings and functions of the Non-Productive
Derivations p142.)Perfective.
      The suffixes in this category are in their broad meaning nonfuture markers
used for events that are completed,, or about to be completed, at the time of the
speech act. They thus encode a temporal feature of nonfuture as well as an
aspectual feature of perfectivity. To illustrate their meaning, here are a few
examples:

        'I have scooped up our big fish with the fish trap.'
       There are instances where the nonfuture perfective is used for events that
are not yet completed at the time of the utterance. Such events are punctiliar and
the perfective is used to indicate that the outcome or achievement is inevitable
and imminent. It is for this reason that it is appropriate the marker should
involve a temporal element, namely, the nonfuture. Consider the following
examples where the imminent realisation and the punctuality of the event
necessitate the perfective:
(3.98) ka pe- ka wabi dikayrt-i
        1SgA Deix-1SgA 2n SgO leave- Pf
         'I will now leave you (pl) here.'

         1SgA Deix-1SgA 2Sg0 1 /2Sg0-sit- PfSg
         'I am now leaving you (sg) here.'
       The perfective suffixes are also used to indicate a change of state, something
that has re~ulted from a process:
(3.100) kara      tag pim ismi-                da
         1SgGen hand finger cut Sg/DualO-PfSg
         'My finger got cut.'

         'The shop is closed, i.e. it has become closed.'
       Contrast the above example (3.103) with that below (3.104) which is a
nominalised verb used in an ascriptive sentence and involves a state, not a
change of state:
(3.104) able pamas aymir+aymir ike-                  (redi)
         Det shops close N.           n PIS be(thing)-Pr
          'The shop is closed.'","[117, 118, 119]"
"Arguments for considering the glides as underlying consonants.
(i)    There are only sequences of vowel plus glides or glides plus vowels within
the one syllable. Other vowel sequences always occur over two syllables with a
glide intervening although it may not be very prominant, e.g. kayed
'grandparent', keyar 'crayfish', eyu 'type of grass', iyu 'tears Instr', Mowa 'island
name'. Phonotactically, the glide occurs in a position typically occupied by a
consonant and thus, could be regarded as part of the consonant system.
(ii)   With some lexemes, there are examples of two glides and a vowel within
the one syllable:
       syaw 'sneeze'
       bway 'kinspeople'
       way 'seed inside the coconut'
       yey 'large blind shark'
       waw 'yes, hole'
       If glides are analysed as underlying vowels, then an account must be made
in the phonotactics of a possible sequence of three vowels- a somewhat unusual
phenomenon amongst languages of the world. If, however, the glides are
analysed as underlying consonants, then a sequence eve can be hypothesized- a
pattern which can be found elsewhere in the language.
       The analysis of glides as consonants will still require further specification
in the phonotactic outline of the language because the only clusters that are
permitted word initially are those of a consonant plus glide type.
(iii)  Glides will have to be postulated to account for their use across morpheme
boundaries:
       tutu-em-tutuw-em 'type of doll-all'
       ,     ,
       1-u-1y-u   'tears-ms
                         â¢ tr
                           I
       6+o-6w+o 'courageous' (lit: liver+liver)
       le-em-ley-em-le-m 'person-all'       The decision as to whether glides are part of the consonant system or part
of the vowel system cannot be made at this stage of the analysis. More data and
evidence needs to be collected. In this analysis, glides will be presented as part of
the consonant system although this is only tentative.",[24]

"Arguments for considering the glides as underlying vowels:
(i)     There is a speech style called nasnas mir 'sorry talk' which is used by the
speaker to convey sympathy I grief for the topic (which might also be the
addressee). The phonetic change that takes place only affects verbs and more
specifically the initial vowel or vowel plus glide sequence in the verb. If the
initial vowel is /a/, then a glide /w/ is prefixed to it. If it is any other vowel or
vowel plus glide, these are deleted and a back vowel /u/, /o/ or /w/ is inserted:
                                                                               10
#V[ +high,+front] C V[ +high,+front] ----> #u C V[+high,+front]
#(C) a                                   ---> #(C) wa
elsewhere                                -----> #(C) o
For example:
        da-li        ---->        dwali 'n PIS be(person) Primpf'
        digem        ---->        dogem 'walk'
        er6          ---->        or6 'eat'
        iri          ---->        uri 'smoke, drink'
        When there is a vowel plus glide sequence, both phones are deleted and
replaced by a back vowel:
        ewpamaret------> 6pamaret 'jump'
        This provides some evidence that these are underlying vowels for the fact
is that the replacement by the vowel affects both vowel and glide if there is one.
This suggests that glides could be part of the vowel system as rules affecting
vowels also affect them.
        On the other hand, it is generally regarded that glides do share features in
common with vowels and hence their frequent label as semi-vowels. The above
phonetic changes can simply be regarded as evidence of features in common
between vowels and glides.
(ii)    There is an example of a word that has the sequence glide plus vowel and
when it is abbreviated, the glide becomes syllabic which suggests it must be
underlyingly a vowel:
        negwam ------>      negu 'cousin'       (i.e. w --> u)
Conversely, one can state the change in terms of a glide becoming syllabic when
there is no other vowel in the syllable.
(iii)   There is morphophonemic evidence that at least some verbs have as their
underlying form a vowel sequence rather than a vowel plus glide sequence:
        b-6s 'pl S be born'
        e-wsmer 'n PIS be born' (i.e. underlyingly eo)
parallel to:
        ba-wm 'pl S die'
        e-wmi 'nonpl s die' (i.e. underlyingly ew)
        The use of the glide symbol in the word ewsmer obscures the
 morphophonemic relationship between the sequence /ew/ and /o/ whereas if
one represents it as a vowel sequence /eo/ (with rules that apply later and
 transform the sequence eo --->ew, the change is more transparent and easier to
 account for. However, the relationship between the two forms is not always as
 clear. If one considers the following examples where the future 1st person is
 marked by the infixation of the vowel I a/, in the first example, i--->aw whilst in
 the second example, i---->ay:
         diski 'open Sg/DualO'                                                                             I I
        dawskilu 'open Sg/DualO Futl'
        dimi 'close Sg/DualO'
        daymilu 'close Sg/DualO Futl'
        Thus, the rule can only be formulated very generally stating that an
accented vowel will become a vowel plus glide sequence when an affix (prefix or
infix) is attached. Is it appropriate to use morphology to prove something in the
domain of phonology? Whilst it is the linguist's task to assemble data from all
areas and assess these in relation to each other, it does not necessarily follow that
an analysis in one area justifies a particular analysis in a different area.
(iv) There are examples in the data where the vowel plus glide sequence
sounds like a complex rather than a single peak; it sounds like two syllables
rather than a single syllable. Examples contrasting single and complex peaks
follow:
        peybri-peibri 'name of a clan, moiety(?)'(3syll) peym 'dream'(lsyll)
        bawr- baur 'spear'(2syll)                            baw 'enter'(lsyll)
        Bewr- Beur 'village name'(2syll)                     Dew 'village name'(lsyll)
        Note that if the examples in the first group were transcribed with the extra
syllable (e.g. eyi), then there could be no claim that the underlying forms were a
monophone vowel sequence as they would represent a sequence of two syllables
with the glide marking a syllable boundary. On the other hand, if these were
transcribed as a single syllable (e.g. eyC), the task would remain to account for
why the first group of words sound different to the second group and if these are
phonetically as opposed to phonemically distinct.
        There are two complex peaks in the following environments:
(i) There is an accented vowel I e/ and palatal glide followed by a voiced
consonant cluster, e.g. peybri [pefuri] 'clan name', eyrsida [eirsida] 'SgS moored
 (Pf)'. Contrast with: neys [neys] 'two', peym [peym] 'dream', deyb [deyb]
 'swelling, mound'.
 (ii) There is a front accented vowel and bilabial glide followed by a consonant,
e.g. ewmida [eumida] 'SgS die (Pf)', gewm [geum] 'fear', iwri [iilri] - ewri [euri]
 'SgS weave (Pf)', newr [neur] 'unmarried female', newd [neud] 'parrot fish',
 ewsmeda [eusmeda] 'SgS come out (Pf)', ewtmer [eutmer] 'ask'. Contrast with:
 new [new] 'ripe', Dew [dew] 'village name'.
 (iii) There is an accented vowel and glide followed by a voiced consonant /r /,
 e.g. toyr [t6ir] 'fat', gayr [gafr] 'many', wawr [waur] 'type of wind', bawr [baur]
 'spear', teyr [tefr] 'decorated'. Contrast with: ays [ays] 'bring Pauc/PlO', Koyti
 [k6yti] 'name of person', waw [waw] 'yes', Bawz [bawz] 'name of village', awmkep
 [awmkep] 'type of cloud', aydir+aydir [aydir+aydir] 'lie Adj'.
      The same data could be examined reaching the conclusion that a vowel
sequence is a valid analysis. Glides do share features with vowels and their
                                                                              12
ability to become syllabic or maybe make the syllable sound longer is a
consequence of one such feature.","[21, 22, 23, 24]"
"8.    The ablative case (-lam/-ilam), like the allative case, has local, temporal
and causal meanings. It is used to mark the point from which there is
movement away:
(2.51) e      op- dewday- lam ta- bakyamu- da
         3SgS face-mainland-Ahl Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
         'He came from Papua New Guinea.'

         3SgS Deix-climb down-Pf hill- Ahl
         'He came down from the hill.'
       This case inflection can also be used to mark the cause (of a non-finite
clause):
(2.53) ka gim+gim n(a)- a-                        Ii      waywi aro- lam
         lSgS illness Adj 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf mangoO eatN-Abl
         'I am sick from eating mangoes.'
       It can also be extended in meaning to include a temporal notion, i.e. to
mark from a particular point in time:
(2.54) ki-lam 'from/ since last night'
         emeret-lam 'from a long time ago'9.     The genitive case (-ira - -ra) is used to mark the beneficiary or goal of an
action:
(2.55) ka laglag epey           a- rapey-           lu      kari    ama- ra
        lSgS wantN basketO Futl-buy Sg/DualO-FutlSg lSgGen mother-Gen
        'I want to buy a basket for my mother.'
       Note that there is overlap in the functions of the allative case with its
purposive function and the genitive case with its beneficiary function. (It remains
to be tested whether it can also be used as a maleficiary.) It could be argued that in
Meryam Mir, the genitive case includes within its meaning both a benefactive
and purposive meaning. This would account for the more felicitous and
common sentence given below with the genitive rather than the allative case:
(2.56) kara      mekir          ageg            t-  iruk-       o
         lSgGen almond(tree) fleshy fruit?O Deix-pluck PIO-Fut2/3sg
        'Pick me some almonds.'
         ?kari-m mekir ageg tiruk
               -All
       The two cases, namely the genitive and allative case, must have some
overlap in their function as well as permitting some slight nuance in meaning
because there are examples where the two cases co-occur within a single sentence:
                                                                              39

        'I bought him a new shirt in town.'
       Clearly more work needs to be done in this area to refine the distinctions
between the allative and genitive cases.
       The genitive case is used to mark the possessor/owner of an alienable or
inalienable object/physical quality /person/body part:
(2.58) ka pleyn-ira bUm.er d-              asr- i

(2.60) Lez-ira newbet ewmi-da
        L.- Gen FZ S die- PfSg
        'Les' aunty died.'
       The genitive case can also be used to mark the experiencer of a physical or
emotional state:
(2.61) Galiga-ra werer         bark- i
        G.-       Gen hungers happen-Pf
        'Galiga is hungry /Hunger happened for Galiga.'
(2.62) able le-       ra weku bark- i
        Det person-Gen angers happen-Pf
        'That person is angry I Anger happened for that person.'
       The genitive case cannot occur when the complex noun phrase itself is
marked by a case as in the following examples. In 2.63, it cannot occur with the
locative case; in 2.64, it cannot occur with the ergative case; in 2.65, it cannot
occur with the semblative case and in 2.66, it cannot occur within a noun phrase
itself marked by the genitive case:

         The ending suffixed or pronominal form for the absent genitive is
phonologically homophonous with the 0 argument case form for proper nouns,
i.e. -i,or the accusative pronominal form. One could speculate that the case
marker for this argument is the accusative/ dative case marker as it is used in
adnominal possession, it is typically the base for oblique inflections on proper
nouns and pronouns and, it is used to mark definite or human direct objects.
Another possibility is that there are alternations in the form of the genitive case
morpheme itself, i.e. -i ,.. -y, used when the complex noun phrase in which it
occurs carries another case inflection. Evidence that these are indeed
morphological alternations of the genitive case can be seen by the fact that these
case markers also occur with common nouns (which do not take the case suffix -i
in the accusative case) when they are in a possessor relation within a case-marked
complex phrase:
(2.67) kari        newr-i      kimyar-      ide abi detagr-i
           1SgGen girl- Gen (married)male-A 3Sg0 tell- Pf
           'My daughter's husband told him.'
         Contrast with the lexical compound newr kimyar 'sister-in-law' where
there is no genitive marking (2.83):
(2.68) kari newr kimyaride abi detagri
           'My sister-in-law told him.'
         Another example follows of a common noun suffixed with the alternative
form of the genitive case:
 (2.69) able ama-        y werm-et abi detagr-i
           Det mother-Gen child- SgA 3Sg0 tell- Pf
           'The mother's son told him.'
           *able ama wermet abi detagri
         Although the genitive case marker cannot be confused with the accusative
 case marker in the examples given above, there are many examples in the third
 person singular where these two functions cannot be distinguished, that is where
 the (pro)nominal phrase could be analysed as the 0 argument or as the
 phonologically reduced genitive case. For example:                                                                           41

person objects or 3rd person non-singular objects will be cross-referenced on the
verb.)

       -ira I elsewhere            ex. newr-ira omay 'the girl's dog'  10.     The associative case (-kem) is suffixed to an inanimate noun to indicate
  that it was associated although not used to perform the action:

           'He gathered up his things with these words: .. .'
          Contrast the above examples with the following where the instrumental
  case is used to indicate the action was performed using the object:
  (2.76) e digm-i koket-u
                             -Instr
           'He walked using his walking stick.'

           (lit: they (2) did things to each other using words)
          The associative case -kem and the allomorph -ipkem (used with proper
  nouns and possibly with kinship terms, e.g. ama-ypkem 'along with mothers),                                                                            42
are used to indicate that the person was associated with a particular event
although not a participant:

        thingS Intr-take down Sg/DualO-Pf L.- Ass
        'The things were unloaded in Les' presence.'
       A similar form and parallel use occurs with pronominals:
(2.79) Dawgiri erkep ikered-            er        ge Bame-y erdar-i
        D. S     eye n PIS be(thing)-n Prlmpf Deix B-         0 see- Pf

        Deix-Intr-row-Pf 3Sg-Ass sand-Loe land- PfSg
        'Dawgiri was watching when he saw Bame swimming (towards the area
        where Dawgiri was) and right in front of Dawgiri, Bame came up onto the
        beach.' (Dewmer p210, section12)
       Andrews (1985) makes a useful distinction between circumstantial and
participatory roles which correspond neatly to the associative versus
instrumental case. The associative case involves a circumstantial role as the
phrase forms ""part of the setting of the event"" whilst the instrumental case
involves a participatory role with the phrasE; an ""actual participant in the
situation implied by the verb"" (Andrews, Ibid; 69). An argument marked with
-kem/-ipkem is signalling that the thing/person was present although not an
instrument or participant in the activity.
       How does the associative differ from the locative when the locative case
carries a comitative meaning? Whilst the locative case is marked on an animate
noun to indicate thats/he performed the same action at the same place as the
S/ A, the associative case is also marked on an animate noun but to indicate that
s/he was at the same place although not performing the event/activity.
However, there is a further use of the associative suffix which is exploited in a
participatory role to indicate paucal or plural inclusion; in this use, it is always
within a complex noun phrase. This function will be examined in the following
section.","[50, 51, 52, 53, 54]"
"Adjectives.
       Adjectives are essentially a closed class. These include: aw 'big', kebi 'little,
young', debe 'good', adud 'bad'. Also included in this class are determiners and
quantifier words such as netat 'one', neys 'two', kep+kep 'few', wader 'several',
mitkar 'alot', gayr 'many'. As these items are the most representative of
adjectives cross-linguistically, it seems plausible that these are the basic adjectives
with others being derived from nouns or verbs. Words which function as
adjectives modify a noun in some way or are used attributively in a predicative
construction. Their position in the sentence is either before the noun which they
modif)j or preceding an existential verb when they are used with an ascriptive
function.",[41]

      Note that the suffixes are affixed to a noun phrase which is part of a more
complex noun phrase, be it a pronoun or another noun.
       Inclusion is an essential feature of this construction. If a pronoun occurs, it
must refer to the sum of the participants and the associative or dual phrase is
subordinate to it. Note that the cross-reference markers always treat the complex
noun phrase as non-singular. Below are examples to demonstrate the
grammaticality with a nonsingular pronoun and the unacceptability with a
singular pronoun:
(2.85) wa       net- ipkem bakyaw-         da pamas-em?
        2n SgS who-Ass       Pauc/PlS go-PÂ£Pl shop- All

         'We, mother and I, went to the shops.'
         *ka amaey bakyamudaryey pamasem
       It remains to be established whether the use of the associative suffix is a
distinct function and meaning. In this use, it has noun phrase function rather
than clause function. Clearly, however, the two uses are related in meaning.
Participation in the event is marked by the case of the complex whole noun
phrase and by the verbal cross-referencing.
  Several sentence types need to be elicited in order to validate these claims:
 â¢ whether the associative phrase can ever be linked to an 0 argument, e.g. I saw
the man with his walking stick, or, I saw the man walking with his brother.
 â¢ whether the associative phrase can be used with a transitive verb with a plural
agent, e.g. They unloaded the things in front of Les (who did not help at all).
 â¢ whether the nonsingular marker attached to the first nominal in the complex
phrase can be omitted when it is an animate, e.g. Sigar omasker-kem bakyawda
Dawarem 'Sigar and his children went to Dawar.'","[54, 55]"
"
                                                                           149
     In the above example, it is not the contrast between the noun phrases which
triggers the different forms but the different time reference. This is illustrated by
the following example where the two noun phrases are contrasted but the forms
do not alter as the states coincide with the time of the speech act:
(4.3)   kcira    bawr pe ilce
        1SgGen spearS Deix n PlS be(thing)

        'This is my spear, not that one.'
      The same marker ge is used with events or states that occur following the
speech act or at least continue on after the time of the utterance. Although there
are no examples contrasting present and nonpresent within a single sentence,
there are elicited examples which show the ungrammaticality of using a present
marker in a nonpresent context:

contrast with a previous location. Speakers comment that the place is often

meaning:

       Several facts emerge from the examples. The deictic marker does not
indicate relative proximity or distance to the speaker I speech act because the same
marker can be used whether the speaker is pointing to a place close-by or referring
to a place away from the speech act. Relative distance is marked by the deictic on
the verb t(V)- . The deictic marker denotes a place that either the addressee was
not focussing on previously or a place where the referent was not situated before
or only after some point in time and thus can be regarded as a new location.
These examples could also be interpreted as having a presentative/locational
function, Le. 'there is X', or 'Xis/was there'.
       With the non-present, the presentative function is absent and the
nonpresent marker ge is used to indicate a new place or one which the addressee
has not been focussing on. Here are some examples with ge to illustrate its
meaning:

      The same referent in the above example could be one of two arguments. It
could be co-referent with the A, Wayer pit legize 'the people from Wayer point'
or co-referent with the 0, abi (Bame) '3Sg0' since both are the same syntactic
arguments.

        in pain, Dawgiri and Wayda ran, hit him, cracking open his head with the
        club.' (Dewmer, p213, sections 24 to 27)
      In the last example, the first use of the deictic marker ga is unproblematic
and marks as same referent bab 'father' which is S in both clauses. However, the
second use of the marker does not appear to be referring back to any common
syntactic argument of the previous clause, unless nerkep 'heart' and sarup
'castaway' are viewed as the same referent given that one is a part of the other
and the referents are the same by virtue of one being an inalienable part of the
other. Clearly such an interpretation requires an extensive treatment of syntactic
features in complex sentence structures.
      There is evidence of nonfinite clauses with the deictic markers used to
introduce a purposive clause also indicating the same referent is involved:
(4.64) le          o- bakes- lare         able neys ged- ge mekik- em
        peoples Fut3-travel-n PrlmpÂ£Pl Det two island-Loe fishing-All

        Conj Deix-again turtleO searchN-All
        'People travel to these 2 islands to fish and also to look for turtles.'
        (Frank Kaigey, Mekikem, Ngali no.9, Dec. 1984)3)   pa, ga - same event/ state
     Some of the examples with the deictic markers indicate that it is the same
event/ state as that of a previous event or state, i.e. someone else also does the
same I someone else does it the same way. Semantically, the deictic markers
appear to have scope over a larger unit than just a referent and are operating over
the whole proposition. Of course, a category distinction between 'same referent'
                                                                         163
and 'same event/ state' is arbitrary as many examples involve the same referent a5
well. Consider:
(4.65) ki            ge- ki           ta- da-                  le
        1n SgExclS Deix-1n SgExclS Deix-n PIS be(person)-n PrlmpfPauc

        'We were there, Kinor was also there/ We were there and so was Kinor.'
(4.66) ki            ge- ki            ta- da-                 le
        1n SgExclS Deix-1n SgExclS Deix-n PIS be(person)-PrimpfPauc
        Kinor ga daw-                   er
        K.      Deix n PIS be(person)-n Prlmpf
        'We(excl) were there, Kinor was also there.'
       The two examples above were chosen as the deictic markers have the same
function w;th Â·only the temporal reference Q5 different. The S of the pa/ ga clause
could be said to be included within the S of the previous clause as it is a plural
pronoun of which the S of the second clause is a part. In both of these, the
function of the deictics could be analysed as indicating the same place. However,
the example below provides counter-evidence for this hypothesis:
(4.67) netat post ge isk- i, nerut post ga t- isk- i
        one <EngS Deix stick-Pf another <EngS Deix Deix-stick-Pf
        'One post was stuck in there, the other post was also stuck over there.'
        (The deictic markers are referring to different places.)
       This example also demonstrates there is no restriction on referents being
the same in both clauses unless the two posts are thought of as a pair, i.e. one is a
part of the other and vice versa (after all, it was two posts of a clothes line!) If a
category marking the same event/ state is proposed then the absence or presence
of co-referent arguments is not an issue.
       Another example to illustrate this use follows:
 (4.68) Geygi baka b6zer erdar-o           ewdi       b6zer dike- lu,
         G.S go eel sp.O see- PastSg therefore eel sp.O spear-PastSg

         gas       dike- lu,    ga tabger-o: 'arna, na-             lar?'
         eel sp.O spear-PastSg Deix point- Past mother, Q clitic-fish
         'Geygi went, saw a small eel, so (he) speared the small eel, held it up to his
         mother: 'Mother, what (kind of) fish is it?' Nageg said to him: 'The
                                                                             164
        small eel is an edible fish.', and so he (that same one) went off again,
        speared a large eel, also held it up: 'Mother, what (kind of) fish is it?""
      The gloss proposed by the speaker for the deictic marker ga was 'again' but it
is unclear whether he was referring to the referent, i.e. Geygi, or the events, i.e.
going off again and pointing something out to his mother again. The same
problem is encountered in the example below where the deictic marker could be
indicating the same A or 0, or it could be indicating a repetition of the event:
(4.69) ese ma abi erdar-wa, abi ga detager-wa
        if 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Irr 3Sg0 Deix tell-            Irr
        'If you should see him, then you should also tell him.'
        (i.e. tell him what I have told him or what you have told him before)
      Some examples have been collected with the deictic marker used within a
phrase:
(4.70) Nageg pa- ko         abra werem Geygi,
        N.S Deix-again 3SgGen childS G.S?
        wi       o-       da-r(a)-      a-               Ii     Ne-ge
        3n SgS RemPast-1 - 3n SgS-1 n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf N.- Loe
        'Nageg and also her child Geygi were living at Ne.'
      Would one want to consider the presence or absence of an immediate verb
as the criterion for determining whether the deictic marker is operating within a
phrase or over the whole clause?4)     pa, ga - logical relation
       In all the examples with the deictic markers pa and ga, there is also a
relation of logical dependency as encountered with the markers pe and ge. The
logical relation might be, as discussed earlier, a temporal one marking a sequence
or partial overlap between one clause and the previous one or a relation
indicating a result or consequence. The temporal relation, although similar to
that of the deictic markers pe and ge, generally involves a closer unity in time
between the clause and its antecedent. It also requires the antecedent clause to
bear a causal relationship to the following clause. Here are some examples to
illustrate the meaning of the deictic markers when they are marking both a
temporal and logical relation with the previous clause:

       There are examples in the data which appear to contradict the temporal
restriction that the deictic markers pe and pa can only occur in the present.
Consider the following examples where the markers are used in the nonpresent
and more specifically the past:

       There is also one example where the deictic marker ge is being used with
present temporal reference:
(4.77) ki            ge- ki            ta- da-                le,

         'We (few) were there (earlier), Kinor was there too.'
       There are various explanations which fit the different examples but no
single explanation accounts for all of them. At first glance, it seems that the
present deictic markers are being introduced sometimes to give the text a 'lively'
feel about it; this is what is often labelled the present narrative. In some cases,
they are used for events/states that lie outside the narrative proper, e.g. that one
which I am now talking about/ this one which I am now talking about. A closer
look will reveal that the most plausible and convincing explanation combines a
number of inter-related factors.
       The deictic marker pe is becoming exclusively used for animate subjects
which are contrastive in function. Thi~ in turn, contrasts with the marker ge
which is used in the single example in the present with inanimate non-subjects to
mark a place. The deictic marker pa is also losing its temporal reference for a
different reason. The marker frequently occurs with stative verbs which are
losing their temporal reference because of phonological reduction in their forms
 (see the introductory section on Tense/ Aspect/ Mood/Number Suffixes, p100).","[172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178]"
"     Comparison with the Genitive Construction.
           Anderson (1985; 185) claims that the genitive case when marked on the
     possessor 'really expresses the fact that one noun is subordinate to and a modifier
     of another'. This is verified in Meryam Mir where the possessor acts as a
                                                                                66
modifier to the head. Many of the nominal compounds encountered can be
paraphrased by a genitive construction:
(2.235) kaba- (ra) lam
        banana- Gen leaf
        'banana leaf'
(2.236) tag             (ira) kok
        hand,arm- Gen joint
        'elbow'
(2.237) kole-          (ra) mir
        European-Gen word
        'English'
       Whilst Anderson's claim captures the structural difference between a
genitive construction (being subordinate) and a compound, what of the the
semantic difference? The choice of one particular construction over another is
determined by whether it is new information or not, with the genitive being used
for new information:
(2.238) .. .lam abra, kaba- ra lam (dike),
              leaf 3SgGen banana-Gen leaf n PIS be(name)
        kaba lam t-             iri-          0,     t-   ays-            0        banana leaf Deix-cut Pauc/Pl0-Fut2/3 Deix-carry Pauc/Pl0-Fut2/3
         ' ... its leaves, the banana tree's leaves, cut the banana leaves, bring them .. .'
         (How to make damper, p220, section9)
       In other cases, compound nominals cannot be paraphrased by a genitive
construction as it will yield an unacceptable phrase or signal a change in the
meaning:
(2.239) *poni-ra wer
            eye- Gen star,egg
(2.240) newr-                       ira kimyar
         (unmarried) female-Gen (married)male
         'daughter's husband'
as opposed to:
         newr-kimyar
         'unmarried sister-in-law'
       Nonetheless, a close relationship does exist between compounds and the
genitive construction. This may be the result of the restriction on the genitive
case when another case marker follows within the same phrase causing many
juxtaposed nominals to co-occur.
       The possessor can be modified in a genitive construction whereas only the
head noun (or it could be the whole compound) can be modified with a syntactic
 compound:
                                                                                   67
(2.241) aw enew          tarn
        big wongai tree branch
        'a big wongai branch'
(2.242) aw enew-ra tarn
                  gen
        'branch of the big wongai tree'
       On the basis of this, one can hypothesize that the genitive construction
represents a looser syntactic construction derived from a syntactic process
whereas nominal compounds represent a tighter syntactic construction derived
from a morphological process.

"1.4   The Syllable.
       The syllable remains inadequately defined in linguistics. Attempts have
been made to<cllTelate it with acoustic and physical properties such as a chest
pulse (Ladefoged, 1975; 220) or by asking the speaker (Ibid; 218). Other attempts
have focussed on the different types found within the phonological or
phonotactic system appealing to features such as onset, nucleus and coda
(Clements and Keyser, 1983; 11) as well as rules generating a set of possible syllabic
types for any given language (Kahn, 1980; 39). None of these approaches prove to
be entirely satisfactory when attempting to isolate just what is a syllable in a
given language.",[29]

        'He kept on cutting down light things (wood) (and) throwing them into

(An important point to note from the above example is the use of 3rd person
singular pronoun in the second clause: e-ge ... which does not in fact correlate
with the S/ A of the verb in terms of number, i.e. it is marking plural instead of
singular. One would expect to have a nonsingular pronoun. This might lead one
to suspect that it is not the pronoun being marked by the deictic but the event,
clause or even the whole proposition. More about this will be said shortly.)
      The use of the deictic markers to focus or contrast referents is further
exploited to introduce a clause that makes the referent specific, i.e. it is used as a
kind of restrictive relative clause marker. It would be premature to label such
constructions as restrictive relative clauses without having undertaken a full
                                                                            156

      There are examples where the deictic markers cannot be readily identified as
focussing on specific referents but rather on whole propositions.1 either in the form
of a single predicate proposition or of a multi-predicate proposition.

propositions involve a relation of logical dependency. This logical relation might
be, at the very least, a temporal relation marking a sequence or partial overlap
between one proposition and the previous one (such as in the t.lCatortes quoted

     It may be that the logical relationship established between two referents or
propositions is the result of inference and not part of the meaning proper of the
deictic markers themselves. This is an area requiring further investigation.4.2.3 pa,ga1)    pa - relative to present time/ space; ga - relative to nonpresent time/ space
      The same temporal distinctions as pe and ge serve to contrast the related
deictic markers pa and ga which can both be defined roughly as having the same
referent or event/state as a previous proposition. The difference between pa and
ga lies in their temporal reference. Pa is restricted to the present, ga to the
nonpresent as defined earlier. Note that the marker pa can include states which
began earlier than the day of the speech act and remain current at the time of the
speech act utterance. The following examples illustrate the time distinctions:

       The reason for the ungrammatical sentence given above is that the present
deictic marker pa conflicts in its temporal reference with the future event.
       An example where the present deictic marker is suitable follows:

         They(2) changed their language (Central Islanders'), their language, so that

"3.2    Verb Types: Atelic Stative and Telic Active.
       There are two distinct verb types in the language distinguished by their
different morphological markers. The first group of verbs takes temporal suffixes
which distinguish present (-(re)di/-o) from nonpresent (-(re)der/-o). The second
group of verbs takes temporal/ aspectual suffixes which distinguish between
(non)present imperfective (-li/-eyey /-le/-eda; -er/-ley /-le/-lare) and perfective
(such as the forms -i/-iyey /-idare/-da). (The differences in forms correspond
roughly to different number marking and there is no temporal/ aspectual
marking for some numbers. See the section on Temporal/ Aspectual/
Mood/Number markers 3.8.1 p99 for more details.)
       As is apparent from the markers, the first group does not distinguish
perfective from imperfective whereas the second group does. This difference
reflects to some degree semantic categories corresponding to atelic stative verbs                                                                           84
for one group and to telic active verbs for the other. Consider for example the
following two related intransitive verbs emri 'sit down' (telic active) and imi 'be
sitting' (atelic stative):
(3.15) ki               d-               imi-                redi
         1n SgExclS 1/2Dual/PaucS-Sg/DualS be sitting-Pr
         'We (2excl) are sitting.'
(3.16) ki               emri-          daryey
         1n SgExclS n PIS sit down-PfDual
         'We two (excl) sat down.'
       The two examples given above show that number cross-referencing differs
depending on whether it is an atelic stative or telic active verb. The former
category, i.e. atelic statives (3.15), cross-references by means of prefixes equivalent
to those used for 0. The latter category, i.e. telic &;Â¢.tives (3.16), cross-references by
means of suffixes equivalent to those used predominantly for A. Compare the
cross-reference marking with intransitive verbs to the following transitive verb
imri 'seat someone' (3.17), where the person and number of 0 is marked with a
prefix d- and the number of A is marked with a suffix -daryey:
(3.17) ki               wabi d-          imri-daryey
         1n SgExclA 2Sg01/2n SgO-sit- PfDual
         'We two sat you(2) down.'
       Compare this example with those of intransitive verbs. The atelic stative
verb's cross-reference marker for S matches that of the transitive verb's 0 cross-
reference marker, i.e. a prefix, and the telic active verb's cross-reference marker
for S matches that of the transitive verb's A cross-reference marker, i.e. a suffix.
Although the markers do not always correlate in such a neat one to one
correspondance, there are instances where they do.
        The temptation is to consider the two verb types, namely the atelic stative
and telic active, as derivations of each other. Such an approach would be
inappropriate as not all verbs have an active and stative form. For example, the
verb ikasir 'be going along' and the verb esk (< Vkos) 'be flowing' only have
 stative forms:
 (3.18) e        ikaser-         edi
          3SgS be going along-Pr
          'He is going along.'
          *e ikaser-da
                     Pf
          *e ikasr-i
                    Pf
 (3.19) e esk-             edi
          3Sg be flowing-Pr
          'It is flowing.'","[95, 96]"
"
       Bartos proposes 3 different allophones for velar stops that are produced
with the dorsal part of the tongue: palatal-velar [<k][<g], velar [k] [g] and back
velar [>k][>g]. The environments can be summarized as follows:
lkl        > <k        /#-i,e                   lg/ -----> <g           /#-i,e
                       /i,e-i,e                                      /i,e-i,e
     -----> >k         /#-a,o                     ----> >g          /#-o
                       /a,o-a,o                                     /o-o
                       /a,o-#                                       /a,o,u-#
    ------> k          /elsewhere                 -----> g          /elsewhere
      The allophones and environments given are plausible although the
environments given by Bartos for the allophones [>k] and [>g] are not identical.
However, the current corpus of data does not reveal any significant differences in
the point of articulation of these stops. There may be slight fronting of the velar
stop when it is followed by a front vowel and slight backing when it is followed                                                                                7
by a non-front vowel. This is evidenced by the high degree of friction or hissing
sound that can occur upon the stop's release. However, the change at the point
of articulation is minimal./r/

       The reader should note that the allophones along with their
environments are based on a sample of speech of generally older, possibly more
conservative speakers whilst others appear to use, to a greater degree, the                                                                               8
continuant. (This has been confirmed by Rigsby p.c. having worked with an
informant who only used the continuant). No taped or elicited material has been
collected for specifically documenting this and comments are based on casual
observation. It is at least suggestive, however, that the variation between the tap
and continuant is the result of diachronic change reflected in a synchronic study.
This may be an influence from English.
          The change may be as follows. For some speakers, the tap has weakened to
a continuant when preceded by a consonant that occurs at the same point of
articulation,. ie.an alveolar. Rather than producing the alveolar sound then
bringing the tongue back to the same place of articulation for the tap, it is easier
and faster to weaken the tap to an approximant. The change, which may have
started only in these typesof clusters)        , is spreading F~.~ some conservative

speaker~~to most non-alveolar clusters but not to peripheral voiced oral stops for
some reason. Thus in the data collected, there are no examples of peripheral
voiced stops followed by a continuant:
          detagri 'say Pf'          ?detag..Ii
          abr a '3SgGen'             ?ab.la
          Elsewhere (word finally and in non-clusters), the tap still occurs. However,
for        other speakers, the continuant is being used more and more. The
diachronic change can be very tentatively schematised as follows:
(i) r I everywhere
(ii) r I C [peripheral voiced oral stop] -
(iii) ..I IC [alveolar] -
(iv) .i I c -
(v) ..I/ everywhere
          The arrows are an attempt to show a dynamic process of change
rather than a static state. More conservative speakers move down the scale while
less conservative speakers move up the scale. The former will call the language
Meryam Mir and the latter will call it Me..tyam Mi.I.
          The distinction between a trill versus a tap may be erroneous as the rhotic
is never really trilled. What occurs in most instances is a tap or a continuant. It
does appear that in words ending in a rhotic such as berder 'mud', the sound
produced is often a tap followed by a voiceless alveolar fricative whereby the
tongue is not actually hitting the roof of the mouth but the air is passing through
in a series of bursts suggestive that the speaker is at least approximating to a trill.
On the other hand, this may be the result of the high pitch accent occurring on
that syllable and what is being heard is air turbulence produced by a large amount
of energy. In words where the rhotic occurs in non-final position, the sound
produced is a tap or a continuant and elsewhere, it may be a tap or trill.","[18, 19, 20]"
"3.8.3 Inherent Aspectual Features of Verbs.
       Apart from the distinction of atelic stative from telic active verbs on
semantic and morphological grounds, there has been an implicit assumption
throughout the discussion on the meaning and function of temporal/ aspectual/
mood markers that all verbs can be affixed with these markers in order to yield a
meaning directly transparent to the verb root's meaning and the inflection.
Such a view is an over-simplification for it fails to account for the interaction
between verbs' meanings and inflections.
       A number of verbs have an inherently punctiliar meaning, that is they are
all events that have no duration. Verbs in this semantic class include ewmi 'die',
baraygi 'Sg/DualS dive in', baw 'Sg/DualS go in'. Also included in this class are
verbs which involve a specific number such as erapey 'buy Sg/DualO', igared
'take animate Sg/DualO', etaruk 'pick up Sg/DualO', etaker 'gather up Pauc/PlO'.
Some of these verbs are not readily affixed with markers conveying a durative
meaning. Sometimes, such a meaning can only be conveyed periphrastically:
(3.156) kara     ama     ewd- em eke-Ii
        lSgGen mothers dieN-All do?-PrlmpfSg
        'My mother is dying.'
        *kara ama ewmi-li
                   die- Prlmpf
                                                                            122
       For some verbs, only a related paucal/plural form that is indefinite in
number (or possibly generic in meaning) can be associated with durativity or
iterativity:
(3.157) able uteb- ge pe- ka          digwat-            Ii...
         Det place-Loe Deix-1SgA pull in Pauc/Pl fish-PrlmpfSg
         'The place (where) I fish .. .'
         *able uteb-ge pe-ka digwatmu-                Ii
                               pull in Sg/Dual fish
       The speaker is not saying that he catches many fish at that place nor that he
has caught many fish there. What is being conveyed is that it is the place
associated with a particular activity done at frequent intervals, namely fishing.
        With some verbs, a semi-productive morpheme dar- must be used to allow
a non-punctiliar associated meaning of the verb (See end of chapter on Non-
Productive Derivations, p142):
(3.158) e       b(a)- a-                 da(r)-li
         3SgS Intr- put in Sg/DualO-?-          PrlmpfSg
         'He is coming out.'
(3.159) ka mir           atrum-              da(r)-li
         1SgA wordO suggest Sg/DualO-?- PrimpfSg
         'I am suggesting something.'
        Not all verbs can be affixed with this morpheme to produce such a
meaning:
(3.160) *e       ewpama-         da(r)-li
           3SgS Sg/DualS jump-?-         PrlmpfSg
          'He is jumping.'
          ..re ewpamaret-li
               Pauc/PlS jump
        For a number of verbs, temporal/ aspectual markers are exploited lexically
in order to derive a related but slightly different meaning. Thus, durative
marking on a punctual verb such as ewmi 'die' produces a different lexeme in
Meryam meaning 'ache, wither'. Similarly, a punctiliar verb such as igared 'take
Sg/DualO animate' can produce a different lexeme when a durative inflection is
suffixed, namely 'be living with Sg/DualO animate in a defacto relationship':

5.2.1 Equational type Clauses.
       Within equational type clauses, one can include clauses such as equational,
locational, descriptive, existential and proprietive. In fact, the same verbs can be
used for all these types. They can be distinguished from each other semantically.
locational:
(5.16) e       [Caims-ge da-                   Ii]
         3SgS C.-       Loe n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'He is in Cairns.'
descriptive:

         2SgS Neg work- Priv 2SgS 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'You are without work.'
proprietive:
(5.19) abra        neys teter da-ra-      ke
         3SgGen two feetS I -3n SgS-1 n PIS be(thing)
         'It has two feet.'

         1SgGen Neg stone-Priv 3n SgS-PlS be(thing)
         'I do not have money.'
existential:
(5.21) nole [abit-kak irdi                   ] meta- ge
         Neg 3Sg-Priv n PIS be(place,time) house-Loe
         'He is not there, at home.' (lit: It is without him at home.'(?))
equational (i.e. NP1 has the same referent as NP2):
 (5.22) e       [kara    newr                    da-            Ii]
         3SgS 1SgGen (unmarried)femaleS n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
          'She is my daughter.'
        Equational clauses can be distinguished from other types in being able to
 have the topic deleted since it is co-referential with the comment:
 (5.23) kara       berbet da-                Ii
          1SgGen sibling n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
          '(He) is my brother.'
        Deletion of topics with locational, descriptive and proprietive sentences is
 either not possible or it will result in an existential meaning:
 (5.24) *Cairns-ge da-li
          '(He) is in Cairns.'","[195, 196]"

        Number alternations in verb forms appear to follow an ergative-absolutive
pattern in that it is overwhelmingly the number of 0 arguments of transitive
verbs and the number of S arguments of intransitive verbs which determine the
form of the verb root. For example: akaweret 'Sg/DualS climb onto', etir
'Pauc/PlS climb onto' and ikaweret 'load onto Sg/DualO', itir 'load onto
Pauc/PlO'.
        However, there are verb root forms where the number alternations are not
determined by a particular argument but rather by the number of arguments
irrespective of whether they are A or 0 with paucal/plural arguments taking
precedence over singular I dual. For example, consider the related verb roots
etomeret 'show Pauc/PlA or O' and etomer 'show Sg/DualA and O':

"        Examples of juxtaposed nouns can be analysed as nominal compounds for
the following reasons:
(i)     Modifiers precede the noun they qualify and when these occur with
compounds, they cannot interupt it but must precede it and modify both parts of
it:
(2.133) parko+parko kole           mir
         imperfect Adj European word
         'imperfect English'
         *kole parko+parko mir
(2.134) aw lu             tam
         big tree,thing branch
         'big branch'
         *'branch of the big tree'
         *lu aw tam
(ii)     Some compounds are clearly lexical in so far as the meaning of the
compound cannot be gleaned from the sum of the components:
(2.135) beyzam                 mi
         hammerhead shark clam
         'clam sp.'
(2.135) apu        le
         mother person
         'MZS/D'
(iii) For at least some of the compounds) whose components are monosyllabic,
the high pitch-accent only occurs on the second component of the compound
thus indicating a single phonological word and 0. ~hift in 1-IJe accent:
(2.136) bey          lid
         palm leaf bone
         'palm leaf stem'
 (2.137) lu           sik
         tree,thing flower
         'flower'                                                                         55
       There are two kinds of compounds: compound lexemes and syntactic
compounds. Syntactic compounds are those which Lyons (1977; 535) describes as
'regular derived lexemes in that their meaning and distribution can be accounted
for in terms of the productive rules of the language system; and for that reason,
they need not be listed in the lexicon'. Compound lexemes, on the other hand,
have to be listed in the lexicon as they are either idiomatic in their meaning or
the individual components cannot be isolated in form or meaning.
       Examples of compound lexemes whose meanings cannot be deduced from
their components include:
(2.138) newr                 kimyar
         unmarried female married male
         'unmarried sister-in-law'
(2.139) wer        sor
         star,egg shell
         'turtle egg'
(2.140) berbet apu
         sibling mother
       'FZ'
       Examples where there have been phonological changes at the morpheme
boundary so that the meaning and form of the components can only be
hypothesized on the basis of parallel syntactic compounds include:
(2.141) imus
        'beard'
        <ib 'jaw', mus 'hair'
Parallel to the syntactic compound:
(2.142) op             mus
        (upper)face hair
        'moustache'
(2.143) gesep
        'earth, land'
        <ged 'land (mass), sep 'earth'
Parallel to the syntactic compound:
(2.144) ged           kawr
        land(mass) island
        'island'
       Examples where a gloss cannot be found for one of the components as a
result of some phonological change or where a free form has not been obtained,
include:
(2.145) gilid
         'shoulder bone'
         <gir '?', lid 'bone'                                                                          56
(although gir was collected by Ray as meaning 'boar's tusk, a charm worn on the
chest')
(2.146) kirgir makrem
         ?      unmarried male
         'adolescent'
(2.147) sursur werem

                           (lit: your nappie is still stuck on (your) back)
(2.148) dogay meg (Ldo3ax 'devil woman' in ~lawL39aw ya)

(2.149) wadali       lewer
         honey ant? food
         'rice'
        As the reader can note, some of the compound lexemes lacking a gloss for
one of their components are simply the result of gaps in the data and further
elicitation may result in these being re-categorised as syntactic compounds.","[66, 67, 68]"
"      The marker ya overlaps in its temporal reference with the marker i as it can
also be used in the remote past and future.4.4   ya1)    ya - future (nonpunetual)
      In the future, the marker ya occurs with non-punctual events, that is the
marker ya stresses more the durative or iterative nature of the event:

         'How long will you be staying here?'
         (the implication being that the stay is for a long period of time?)
       Contrast these with the following i examples:
(4.127) Kinor, e       i    ut       wa- t-      ipered-      er

         'How long will you be staying for here on Murray?'
         (implication being that the stay is for a relatively short period?)
       Note that a particular deictic marker does not necessarily restrict the
tense/aspect marking on the verb, so that, for example, only the marker ya can
occur with the nonpresent imperfective and the marker i only with the future
(punctiliar). Rather, one finds a slightly different perspective on the event
depending on the marker used. Thus, in the example where the speaker is asking
the addressee about the length of their stay, the marker ya could imply a long stay
whereas the use of the marker i, a shorter finite period.
       There is a contrastive example in the data where the length of time is made
explicitly finite and i is used rather than ya which is unacceptable:

          *ka yaka naw mena aw kikem watirpey2)    ya - distant in time/ space
      In some examples, the marker ya seems to be used to indicate distance away
in time or space. Consider the following examples:
(4.130) ma ya t-          emri-               o
        2SgS Deix Deix-Sg/DualS sit down-Fut2/3

        (i.e. it is unacceptable without the verbal deictic indicating distance)                                                                           176

         'He will show it to Les so you go and have your lunch.'
         (It is ambiguous from the example whether the location is close-by, at the
         place of the speech act or distant.)
       However, there are counter-examples in the data where the marker ya does
not refer to distant location. For example, in the following sentences, the location
is close-by:
(4.133) ka mena ya- ka n(a)- aw-                          er        able ki-   ge

         3SgA still Deix L.- All Det Fut3-show- n Prlmpf
         'He will keep on showing this to Les.'
       These examples can be accounted for if one considers that the marker can
refer to either distance in space or in time and thus, in the first example, the
emphasis is on the distance in time and in the second example, the emphasis is
on the nonpunctual nature of the event.
       There are also counter-examples where the marker ya seems to indicate
neither distance in time nor space:

         'You have been working all day, sit down (and) do not do anything; Kin01
         will sweep the house now.'
      These examples do not in fact conflict with the claim made about the
marker. Distance is a relative term and what one speaker may regard as distant,
another may regard as fairly close. In the above examples, the speakers are
interpreting the time lapse between the speech utterance and the future
realisation of the event in terms of distant (or possibly a more accurate
interpretation would be as non-immediate). Thus, the following utterances
employing the marker i are equally acceptable although the time lapse between
the utterance and the event is far smaller:
(4.137) e      i    wa- t-     akomer-o        mayk-e
         3SgS Deix Fut3-Deix-return- Fut2/3 close- Loe

         K.-     A Deix houseO Fut3-sweep-Fut2/3
         'Kinor will sweep the house right now.'
       From the examples given, the generalization appears to be that the marker
ya is used to mark distance in time or space although this must be determined
within the context. This is not to say that there is no shared concept of such a
notion within the linguistic community for all speakers agree that the following
day to the speech act would be most appropriately expressed by the distant marker
ya:
(4.139) ma ya idim-           ge akomer-o         Mackay-em?

      The marker ya is also used to indicate sequentiality in the future or in the
remote past . To illustrate this, consider first examples in the future:

       Only one example was collected where the marker was used to mark
sequentiality in the remote past:
(4.144) wi        baka i          wa-        wrid-          Ii,

          'They went (and) stayed there; thus (when) their water ran out they then
          had to stay on.'
       It remains to be checked whether the marker ya is necessarily immediate
sequence, non-immediate sequence or either possible interpretation. It is not
possible to generalize about the remote past habitual on the basis of a single
example although it does not contradict those occurring in the future, i.e. it also

       Contrast 2.274 where the pronominal is indefinite with the following
example (2.275) where the pronominal is definite:

       A few examples have been collected with the interrogative pronoun
nalulu:

         'Why is he so happy?'
       Informants have said nalulu is the same as nalu 'what O'. However, the
English gloss might be better captured by 'what kind of X', i.e. what kind of thing
did they get up to yesterday at Dew? What kind of happiness is he feeling? (i.e.
what is the cause?). In other words, nalulu may be the interrogative word used
for asking information about a component of a compound. In order to verify this
claim, questions need to be elicited of the type:
What kind of hair does he have?
What type of house does he live in?
What kind of bananas do you grow? etc.","[84, 85, 86]"
"5.3     The Verb Complex.
        There are a number of uninflected nominals occurring within a sentence.
These must be considered as part of the verb complex. Consider the following
examples:
(5.35) ter mayso [mir iga- Ii]
          reef noises word speak-Prlmpf
          'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.36) Galiga [ut ipe-                 redi]
          G.S     sleep n PIS be lying-Pr
          'Galiga is sleeping.'
        The nominals mir 'word' and ut 'sleep' must be part of the verbal phrase
for the following reasons. The verbs given above are intransitive as evidenced by
zero marking on the S argument so the non-S argument cannot be 0. Its
function must be part of the verb phrase. Other arguments found in support of
this analysis follow.
        Nominals in the verbal phrase must occur immediately preceding the verb,
which suggests they form a syntactic unit:
(5.37) *mir ter mayso igali
          'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.38) *ut Galiga iperedi
          'Galiga is sleeping.'
        There is some suprasegmental evidence that the nominal and verb form a
single phonological unit. The main pitch-accent of the verb phrase is carried on
the nominal when it is mono-syllabic and the verb itself begins with a vowel,
e.g. tit ipe 'n PIS be lying asleep', but ipe 'n PIS be lying'.
        However, there are instances where the nominal's role is not
straightforward and it could either be a verbal nominal (i.e. within the verbal                                                                          187
complex) or a syntactic argument of the verb. Consider the following examples
where the verb might be di-transitive or transitive with a complex verb phrase:
(5.39) koskir-             ide lumi dikris-li      uteb- ge
        (married)female-A weed dear- Prlmpf place-Loe
        'The woman is clearing her place.'
(5.40) koskir-             ide (uteb) lumi dikris-li
        (married)female-A placeO weed dear- Prlmpf
        'The woman is clearing (her place).'
       In 5.39, number reference for the nonA nominal (be it 0 or whatever) is
automatically plural and no further cross-reference marking can be used. As 0
arguments for transitive verbs can be cross-referenced on the verb for number,
one must assume that the nominal is not an 0 and thus part of the verb complex.
Contrasting with this, in 5.40, number specification for 0 is singular, referring to
the number of yards, and cross-reference marking can be used to indicate
nonsingular number as exemplified below:
(5.41) koskir-             ide neys uteb lumi da-ra-        kris- i
         (married)female-A two placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-Pf
         'The woman cleared two yards.'
(5.42) koskir-             ide neys a    netat uteb lumi da-ra-        kris- idare
         (married)female-A two Conj one placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-PÂ£Pauc
         'The woman cleared several yards.'
(5.43) koskir-             ide mitkar uteb lumi da-ra-        kris- a
         (married)female-A many placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-PÂ£Pl
         'The woman cleared many yards.'
       The cross-reference markers for 0 provide syntactic evidence that the
nominal lurni 'weed' is part of the verbal complex and not an 0 argument.
       Given that there are complex verbal phrases in the language, it may be
possible to interpret one of the arguments of a di-transitive verb as a nominal
within the verb phrase rather than a syntactic argument. Consider an example
with a di-transitive verb such as ikwar 'give':
(5.44) ka       abi lu        ikwar-          i
         lSgA 3Sg0 thingO give Sg/DualO-Pf
         'I gave him something.'
(5.45) ka        abi lu      na-      kwar-         i
          lSgA 3Sg0 thingO 3n SgO-give sg/ dualO-Pf
          'I gave him two things.'
          (cross-reference marking to the inanimate 0 argument lu 'thing')
 (5.46) ka       yabi lu        na- kwar-             da
          lSgA 3n SgO thingO 3n Sg-give Sg/DualO-PfFl
          'I gave them something.'
          (cross-reference marking to the animate 0 argument yabi '3n SgO')                                                                           188
       As either of the nonA nominals can be cross-referenced on the verb (5.45
and 5.46), one must assume that both nominals are syntactic arguments of the
verb with the specification that only one of the arguments can be cross-referenced
at any one time on the verb. More examples need to be collected with (di)-
transitive verbs to prove this.
       A couple of transitive verbs have been collected where the nominal can
either be part of the verb complex or a syntactic argument:
(5.47) ka       mara mir        asr- i
         1SgA 2SgGen wordO hear-Pf
         'I heard your message.'
(5.48) ka lar- ira gepi           ditkiri-   (i)
         1SgA fish-Gen scalesO peel,scrape-Pf
         'I scaled the fish.'
(5.49) ka       mari mir n(a)-      asr- i
         1SgA 2Sg0 word 1/2Sg0-hear-Pf
         'I heard you (talking).'
(5.50) ka kumala              gegur ditkiri-      (i)
         1SgA sweet potatoO peel peel,scrape-Pf
         'I peeled the sweet potato.'
       It is unclear what the semantic distinction is between the two types. One
possibility may be that the nominal incorporated into the verbal phrase (5.49 and
5.50) is indefinite whilst the non-incorporated nominal (5.47 and 5.48) is definite.
An alternative explanation would be that the incorporated nominal focusses on
the activity itself whilst the non-incorporated nominal focusses on an end-point,
a purpose. Note, however, that for many verbs, there is no choice.
       There are examples of lexicalised complex verb phrases, that is where the
noun is an inseparable part of the verb phrase and its meaning. Examples of
lexicalised complex verb phrases include for intransitive verbs: i ezo 'cry'
(<tearN, shed?), erer ekri 'shout, squawk' (<shoutN, emit?), segur etker 'play'
(<playN, ?), kobek esi 'cough' (<coughN, bang down upon waves), and for
transitive verbs: upi diti 'help' (<tail?,?), lag dasur 'smell' (<smellN, ?), tag
digwat 'shake hands' (<hand, pull), op dipit 'meet' (<face, hit?), tep diskir 'taste'
(<skin of fruit, activity to do with mouth?).
       Within complex verbal phrases, a nominal can always be isolated from the
verbal component because verbal inflections occur only on the verb, not on the
nominal, and the nominal can always occur as an independent lexeme. It seems
that the generalization is as follows: at one end of the continuum, there are
nominals functioning as syntactic arguments of the verb and at the other end of
the continuum, there are nominals within verbal phrases forming an essential
part of the verb phrase's meaning. In between these two extremes, there are
                                                                            189
some verbs which allow both types to occur and these are exploited for various
stylistic purposes.
0 argument<--------------------------------------------------------------->N + V> VP5.4      The Noun Complex.
         The structure of a noun complex is as follows:Determiner-          N[modifier]-      N[head]       - giz 'Pl'
                     lAdjective                      Â·(iba-ibi 'n Sg') Â£N-kem 'Ass'
                     lNoun-Gen                                         lN-ey 'Dual'(5.51)  [able mitkar epey ] pe da-ra-            mar
          Det many baskets Deix I -3n SgS- I PIS be resting upon
        'The many baskets are there (resting upon something).'
(5.52) [able kebi bam+bam nar ] pe ikase
        Det little tumeric Adj boats Deix be going along
         'The little yellow van is going by.'
(5.53) lim-ira bi
        sun-Gen light
         'sunlight'
      Case inflections are suffixed to the head or clitic immediately following the
head, i.e. giz, iba-ibi. Genitive nouns follow the order with the possessor (the
modifier) preceding the possessed (the head).
      The plural marker -giz(e) always directly follows the noun which it
modifies:
(5.54) gayr le-         gize kari na-     tager-da
         alot person-PIA lSgO 1/2Sg0-tell- PÂ£Pl
         'Alot of people told me.'
       The marker -giz(e) behaves like inflections, which are always suffixed to the
noun. It can be regarded as a post-clitic since it forms a single phonological unit
with the noun, i.e. there is a single pitch-accent, e.g. netat le '1 person', gayr le-giz
'many people'.
       Not included in the structure of the noun complex outlined above are
locational adjuncts often involving a nominal and a locational noun acting like a
kind of postposition. Both are inflected for case:
(5.55) ka [pon- ge muy- ge] na-                 zirk-                  edi
          lSgS <Eng-Loe inside-Loe 1/2Sg/PlS-Sg/DualS be inside-Pr
