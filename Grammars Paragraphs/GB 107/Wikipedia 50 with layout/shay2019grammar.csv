the pévé language                                                                  196.12     Negation
Negation in Pévé is unusual in two respects, namely dual marking of negation
and the scope of negation. Negation of the indicative clause is marked by the
negative marker tsú immediately after the subject noun or pronoun and the
negative marker mì at the end of the clause. The marker tsú can be omitted
only if the negative clause is a response to a question.
   An interesting feature of Pévé is that whether or not tsú occurs, the scope
of the negative clause is the entire proposition. Attempts to elicit interrogative
sentences in which only one constituent is negated, e.g. the equivalent of ‘he
bought a cow, not a goat’, resulted in two separate clauses, one affirmative and
one negative: ‘he bought a cow; he did not buy a goat’. Unlike in some Chadic
languages, the coding of tense and aspect in the negative clause in Pévé is the
same as that in the affirmative clause.","[34, 35]"

2        Indicative ClausesIn most instances, negation of the indicative clause is coded by the negative
marker tsú immediately after the subject noun or pronoun and the negative
marker mì at the end of the clause. Following are examples in various aspects
and tenses:Perfective aspect:(1) Taú tsú tá lúmò tám kə              bə̀kà  mì
    T. NEG go market today ASSC morning NEG
    ‘Tau didn’t go to the market this morning’Cf. the affirmative perfective:(2) Taú tá lúmò tám kə            bə̀kà
    T. go market today ASSC morning

    3F NEG sell       milk NEG
    ‘she does not sell milk’Cf. the affirmative unmarked aspect:(4) tá gi tsoɓ súm fə̀tà lúmò
    3F sell     beer day market
    ‘she sells beer on the day of the market’The non-existence of an entity can be coded through negation of the affirma-
tive clause:(5) mòta       tsú gàk tsuwal ɗáw mi
    car (Ful.) NEG can cross one NEG
    ‘No car could cross it.’ (or ‘Not one car could cross it’)(6) mum ti ɬew ɓay mum tsú ár                 kam kwá məsin mi
    3M eat meat CONJ 3M NEG leave rest                other NEG
    ‘he ate the meat and did not leave any behind’The same variations in constituent order that occur in affirmative clauses also
occur in negative clauses. For example, in the future tense there is an alterna-
tion between the form S Tense/Aspect V O IO ne and the form S Tense/Aspect
IO V O (see chapter 8). Either form can be negated by the same means, namely
post-subject tsú and clause-final mì:S NEG Tense/Aspect V O IO ne NEG:(7) na tsú də̀ gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn          ùm ne mì
    1SG NEG FUT sell          cow 1SG.POSS 3M.O ADP NEG

    ‘I will not sell him my cow’

The markers may occur in succession or may be separated by other constitu-
ents:(9) mə̀ na tsu mi
    mə̀ na tsú mi
    REL 1SG NEG NEG
    ‘“It wasn’t mine!”’(10) dàw       nə     tsú ɗáw zaʔ mi!

     ‘So not one child can be found!’(11) ta tsú kə       sə̀lày mì

     ‘she does not have money’Cf.:(12) ta kə     sə̀lay-a
     3F ASSC money-FV
     ‘she has money’Neither of the negative markers tsú or mì can be omitted when the negative
clause is used in isolation, and most negative clauses in natural discourse also
use both negative markers. However, tsú can be omitted in a negative clause
that is a response to a question:(13) Taú (tsú) tá lúmò mì
     T. NEG go market NEG
     ‘Tau didn’t go to the market’ (in response to ‘Did he go to the market?’)As shown in chapter 9, the marker tsú is also not used in the prohibitive
clause:(14) à         ɗak ku nayʔ     mi
     2M.SBJV touch fire DIST.M NEG
     ‘do not touch that fire!’

     2M.SBJV buy clothing ADP 1SG.O one NEG
     ‘do not buy any clothing for me!’The assertive marker si cannot be used in the negative clause. This supports
the analysis that si codes the assertive mood, i.e. the speaker’s desire that the
hearer believe in the occurrence of an event (see chapter 9):(17) handày tsú tsóɓ ya nãw mì *si
     3PL      NEG buy cow NEG ASSERT
     for ‘they did not buy a cow’The sequence zaʔ mi (‘more NEG’) indicates the temporal status of the negated
event or state:(18) na tsu ti fun zaʔ mi
     1SG NEG eat food more NEG
     ‘I do not eat anymore’(19) May tsú bə̀ ndʒí          sə́     zaʔ mi
     M. NEG love husband 3F.POSS more NEG
     ‘May no longer loves her husband’A clause marked negative can serve as an interrogative clause, depending on
context and intonation:(20) ha tsú táʔ l’école dimanche nə       zaʔ mi
     2M NEG go to school Sunday DED.M more NEG
     ‘you no longer go to Sunday school?’The negated clause can also be followed by the interrogative marker su. Note
that the following clause also involves the permissive modality marker ye (see
chapter 9), evidence that modality is a distinct domain:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     2M.SBJV walk PERM more NEG             Q
     ‘you’re not walking anymore?’ (the hearer was expected to continue walk-
     ing)
3       Scope of NegationElicited examples suggest that the scope of negation in Pévé is the entire propo-
sition rather than an entity involved in the proposition. Attempts to elicit sen-
tences in which one referent with a given grammatical role is negated while
another referent with the same grammatical role is not negated resulted in sep-
arate clauses: a negative clause and an affirmative clause. Following is a Pévé
translation of the English construction ‘he bought a cow, not a goat’:(22) mum tsóɓ ya nãw àmá          mum tsú tsóɓ hu mì
     3M buy cow but (Ar.) 3M NEG buy goat NEG
     ‘he bought a cow, but he did not buy a goat’Translation of the English ‘he doesn’t buy mine, only yours’ also results in two
separate clauses:(23) mum tsú tsoɓ mə na kpe mì ama                      mum tsoɓ mə
     3M NEG buy PREP 1SG never NEG but (Ar.) 3M buy PREP
     ha taw sar-a
     2M only-FV
     ‘he never buys (what is) mine; he only buys (what is) yours’
4       ConclusionMost negative clauses involve the marker tsú after the subject noun or pronoun
and the marker mì at the end of the clause. The negative marker tsú can be omit-
ted in a prohibitive clause or in a negative clause that is a response to a question.
Tense and aspect are coded in the negative clause as they are in the affirmative
clause. The scope of negation is the entire clause, not a single constituent.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256]"
"         Chapter 14: Negation         AbstractThis chapter describes the means of negating verbal and verbless indicative clauses in
Pévé. All attested negative clauses are marked by the negative particle mì in clause-
final position. In most negative clauses the marker mì is accompanied by the negative
particle tsú, which follows the subject noun or pronoun and precedes the verb. The
means that are used to code tense and aspect in the negative clause are the same as
those used in the affirmative clause. The clause-final marker mì also marks negation in
the prohibitive clause.",[380]

         chapter 14Negation1        IntroductionThis chapter describes the means of negating verbal and verbless indicative
clauses in Pévé. All attested negative clauses are marked by the negative particle
mì in clause-final position. In most negative clauses the marker mì is accompa-
nied by the negative particle tsú, which follows the subject noun or pronoun
and precedes the verb. Situations in which only one negative marker occurs
are described in sections below. Unlike in some Chadic languages (Wandala,
Frajzyngier 2012; Hausa, Newman 2000; Mina, Frajzyngier and Johnson with
Edwards 2005, and others), the means that are used to code tense and aspect
in the negative clause are the same as those used in the affirmative clause. The
means that are used to mark negation in the prohibitive clause, i.e. the negative
counterpart of an imperative or subjunctive clause, are described in detail in
chapter 9.","[251, 252]"
"2.2.2      Speaker’s Obligation: sáyʔ
The clause-initial particle sáyʔ codes the speaker’s sense of his or her own
obligation. The first-person subject can be represented by a pronoun from the
indicative or the subjunctive set:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘come here (so I can punish you)!’ (cf. ‘get over here already!’ in English)2.2.3      Permission: ye
The particle ye, like the particle riʔ, occurs only in phrase-final position. The
two particles cannot co-occur in the same clause. The particle ye is glossed
‘PERM’ for ‘permission’. With a second-person subject, ye conveys the speaker’s
permission to perform an act and can also be interpreted as a polite or formal
command:(32) à          zye ye
     2M.SBJV enter PERM
     ‘go on in/it’s okay to go in!’(33) à          pum nùm ye

     ‘hit him and then catch him!’Clauses ending in ye are not limited to the second-person addressee. Use of
ye with a first-person plural subject indicates the speaker’s suggestion or the
speaker’s desire, both of which imply the speaker’s sense of permission:(38) mə́ tà ye
     1PL go PERM
     ‘let’s walk’In a clause with a third-person subject, the marker yé conveys the speaker’s
permission, wishes or suggestions with respect to the subject:(39) nə̀ mbə̀ yé
     3M come PERM
     ‘may he come/let him come’(40) nə̀/tə̀ ʔyá yé
     3M/3F leave PERM
     ‘he/she should leave’The marker ye can occur in an interrogative clause, where it marks a request
for permission or a question about obligation. Note the use of the subjunctive
subject pronoun as well:(41) á         ɬe ɗérwa ye       su

verb wàʔ ‘to want’ (see chapter 19 for complements of volitional verbs):(43) na wàʔ ʔyá ye
     1SG want leave PERM
     ‘I would like to leave’2.2.4       Prohibitive: mì
A prohibitive clause, the negative counterpart of the imperative or subjunctive
clause, is marked by the clause-final negative marker mì. While most indica-
tive negative clauses involve two negative markers, the clause-final mì and the
clause-internal negative tsú (see chapter 14), the prohibitive clause does not
involve the clause-internal marker tsú. Pronouns used in the prohibitive clause
are from the same set as those used in the subjunctive or imperative clause (see
Table 12, above):(44) à          də̀ han mì

     3M leave NEG
     ‘may he not leave/don’t let him leave’The markers ye (permission), riʔ (obligation) or sáyʔ (speaker’s obligation) can-
not be used in the prohibitive clause. This provides evidence that permission,
obligation, and prohibition are all subdomains within the domain of the sub-
junctive mood:(47) à          tsoɓ mbraw ne nàn ɗáw mi *ye/*riʔ/*sáyʔ

of the epistemic mood, which pertain to the speaker’s degree of belief in the
truth or likelihood of an event. The speaker’s attitude toward the truth of a
statement or the likelihood of a state or event can be expressed by a num-
ber of means, including verbs of saying, verbs of volition, verbs of cognition,
and conditional constructions, all of which are discussed in other chapters.
The discussion here is limited to the clause-final particle ɓo, which codes the
speaker’s reassurance or promise that an event will occur (promise mood), and
the clause-final particle si, which advises the hearer to believe in the occur-
rence of a past, current or future event or state (assertive mood). The evidence
that ɓo and si are both markers of mood is that they cannot co-occur with each
other or with any other markers of mood. The evidence that ɓo and si belong to
a modal domain distinct from that of the subjunctive mood is that all attested
clauses with ɓo or si involve subjects from the indicative set, not the subjunc-
tive set.","[180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"

2        Polar QuestionsPolar questions are defined here as questions that seek the answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’. A
polar question has the form of an indicative clause marked by the phrase-final
particle su. Elicited and natural discourse examples do not show an intonation
pattern distinct from that of affirmative clauses.
  In most examples the interrogative particle has mid tone:(1) Taú tá lúmò su
    T. go market Q
    ‘did Tau go to the market?’(2) hí wé ndày só           ndày       su
    2PL saw 3PL.O house 3PL.POSS Q
    ‘did you see them at their place?’Based on natural discourse data, low tone on the interrogative particle places
emphasis on the proposition in question (the voiceless fricative /s/ is some-
times voiced in intervocalic position):

    3M who Q
    ‘who is he?’ (similar to ‘who does he think he is?’)The assertive marker si before the interrogative particle places emphasis on the
unexpectedness of the event. Here the interrogative marker has mid tone:(7) Taú tá lúmò tám kə             bə̀kà     si        su
    T. go market today ASSC morning ASSERT Q
    ‘did Tau actually go to the market this morning?’ (I told him to)(8) mum tá lúmò si               su
    3M go market ASSERT Q
    ‘did he really go to the market?’ (I told him not to)The marker si cannot be used in a content question, which seeks additional
information about the event. This is evidence for the assertive function of si, as
described in chapter 9, since the speaker cannot advise the hearer to believe in
a state or event that is not fully described:(9) ha tá ka       tám (*si)            su
    2M go where today (ASSERT) Q
    ‘where did you go to today?’ (i.e. I know you went somewhere, but I don’t

tions the truth value of a single element of the proposition:Speaker 1:(10) Taú tá Garoua tám-á
     T. go G.        today-FV

     subject did not go)Cf. the neutral content question:(12) mum tá ka        tám su
     3M go where today Q
     ‘where did he go today?’The polar question marker may co-occur with a marker of modality, e.g., the
permission marker ye. This is evidence that the interrogative mood does not
belong to the same domain as the deontic and epistemic modalities described
in chapter 9:(13) á         ɬe ɗérwa ye       su

3       Content QuestionsContent questions are defined here as questions seeking additional informa-
tion about an event or state whose truth value is taken for granted. Coding
means involved in content questions include content question words, prepo-
sitions, and the clause-final interrogative particle su. The grammatical role of
the constituent in question is coded as it is in the affirmative clause, by linear
order or preposition.","[242, 243, 244]"

     ‘they came so that they could help each other’In the following sentence the purpose clause is not marked by kə́dàn and does
not have a subject. The result is a sequence of two compound verbs, ʔyá táy ‘to
depart for’ and gi tsoɓ ‘to sell’. Omission of the purpose marker kə́dàn is a likely
source for some serial verb constructions:

     3PL      flee PREP brush build fire
     ‘they fled because of the brush fire’The preposition zə̀ followed by the question word mi forms a question about
reason (cf. chapter 13):(82) zə̀    mi ha ʔí         nàn su
     PREP what 2M insult 1SG.O Q
     ‘why did you insult me?’
8       Positive AdjunctPévé has an adjunct whose function is to emphasize the existence or actuality
of an event or state. Native speaker Wambadang views the function of kətáʔ
as the opposite of that of the negative marker tsu … mi (see chapter 14), hence
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

sentence-final or clause-final position. The English translation is approximate:(83) ha wé kwa tí            kətaʔ-a
     2M see thing PROX.F POS-FV
     ‘you really saw something’(84) mum làʔ         də̀ mbə̀ kətáʔ si sáyʔ  na gíláʔ tú
     3M COND FUT come POS REL OBLIG 1SG ready body
     rìn-ì
     1SG.POSS-FV
     ‘if he actually comes, I must be ready’Evidence that kətáʔ is an adjunct is that the form can be deleted from a sen-
tence with very little change in meaning. In the following sentence, the use of
kətáʔ emphasizes the past-time temporal status of the clause:(85) namba ké kə́       sə̀lay kətáʔ-a
     1PL    COP ASSC money POS-FV
     ‘we used to have money’ (but not anymore)Removing kətaʔ does not affect grammatical or temporal relations, but simply
removes emphasis from the temporal status:(86) namba ké kə́       sə̀lay-a
     1PL     COP ASSC money-FV
     ‘we used to have money’Further evidence for the positive function of kətaʔ is that the form cannot occur
in the same clause with the negative marker (tsu) … mi:(87) ta tsú kə        sə̀lày mì *kətáʔ-a
     3F NEG ASSC money NEG POS-FV
     for ‘she does not have money’ (or any other meaning)It is likely that the first syllable of the positive marker kətáʔ stems from the
associative preposition kə. A potential source for the syllable táʔ is the verb táʔ
‘show’ (see chapter 8 and elsewhere).","[330, 331, 332, 333]"
"6.11     Interrogatives
All interrogatives in Pévé, whether polar (‘yes/no’) questions or content ques-
tions, are marked by the phrase-final particle su. Grammatical roles are marked
in the interrogative clause as they are in the affirmative clause. Tense, aspect
and mood are also marked as they are in the affirmative clause. Content ques-
tions distinguish between the human constituent, represented by sa ‘who’, and
the non-human, inanimate or abstract constituent, represented by mi ‘what’.
Content questions also distinguish among questions concerning manner (ma
‘how’) and location (ka ‘where’). Questions concerning the time of an event or
the cause of an event are marked by the prepositional phrases zə̀ mi ‘why’ (lit.
‘for what’) and kə ma ‘when’ (lit. ‘with how’).",[34]

A question about the identity of a human participant in an event involves the
question word sa ‘who’, whose grammatical role is coded as it is in the affirma-
tive clause. The interrogative marker su occurs at the end of the clause:(14) sa dám mbraw ne nùm su
     who sew clothes ADP 3M.O Q
     ‘who sewed clothes for him?’Cf.(15) ta dám mbraw ne nùm su
     3F sew clothes ADP 3M.O Q
     ‘she sewed clothes for him?’The role of the question word as possessor is coded by the position after the
possessum, as it is in the affirmative clause:(16) hu sa víʔ su
     goat who lost Q
     ‘whose goat is lost?’(17) mum wə́     bàr só        sá su

     3M IMPF stay house 1SG.POSS
     ‘he lives at my house’A verbless clause with sa as predicate poses a question about the identity of
the human subject. The person, gender, and number of the referent are coded
by the pronominal subject:(19) ta sa su
     3F who Q
     ‘who is she?’
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M who Q
     ‘who is he?’In a question about the identity of a previously mentioned referent, the de-
ducible reference marker nə (see chapter 12, section 3) follows the question
word:(21) ɓay sàanəsu
     ɓay sa          nə    su
     CONJ who        I.PRO Q
     ‘“So who was it?”’The effect of the demonstrative nə may be to place the question word in focus:(22) sa nə       gí    kwáti ne nùm su
     who I.PRO made food ADP 3M.O Q
     ‘who was it who cooked for him?’3.2      Questions about Non-human Constituents
The question word mi ‘what’ is used in questions about non-human or inani-
mate participants and in questions about abstract constituents. The grammat-
ical function of the question word is marked by linear order or by preposition.
The subject role is marked by clause-initial position:(23) mí gí su
     what go Q
     ‘what happened?’The object role is marked by the position after the verb:(24) mum ti mí su
     3M eat what Q
     ‘what did he eat?’(25) ha wàʔ mì su
     2M want what Q
     ‘what do you want?’

less clause. The subject is represented by the question word mi ‘what’ and the
predicate is a deictic demonstrative coding the person, gender, and number of
the referent (see chapter 12). The relative marker may precede the demonstra-
tive:(26) mi (mə) ni      su
     what REL PROX.M Q
     ‘what is this?’(27) mi (mə) náyʔ      su
     what (REL) DIST.M Q
     ‘what is that?’3.3      Questions about Reason
There are several ways of posing a question about the cause of or reason for an
event, all of which involve a preposition and the non-human question word mi
‘what’.
   The preposition zə̀ ‘for’ followed by mi ‘what’ indicates a question about
reason. The prepositional phrase, like most adjuncts, may be clause-initial or
clause-final. When zə̀ mi is clause-final, the interrogative particle su follows the
prepositional phrase:(28) mum mbə́ zə̀ mi su
     3M come for what Q
     ‘why did he come?’The prepositional phrase zə̀ mi is one of the few constituents that can precede
the subject of the sentence:(29) zə̀    mi mum mbə́ su
     PREP what 3M come Q
     ‘why did he come?’(30) zə̀ mi mum tsú tʃé           mbì mə su
     for what 3M NEG drink water NEG Q
     ‘why didn’t he drink the water?’The preposition zə̀ also marks the affirmative reason clause (cf. chapter 21):
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3PL      flee PREP grass build fire
     ‘they fled because of the grass fire’At the normal rate of speech the preposition zə̀ may be omitted from the rea-
son question, leaving only the question word mi ‘what’. The structure is thus
the same as a question about a non-human participant in the object role:(32) ha tʃiʔ mí ndə́ na         su
     2M cry what like I.PRO Q
     ‘Why are you crying like that?’(33) ha gí mi tám su
     2M do what today Q
     ‘what did you do today?’A question about reason may be coded by the phrase zə̀ dàn (‘for word/matter’)
followed by the question word mi. The sequence zə̀ dàn mi poses a question
about the fundamental cause or root of an event:(34) ha ʔí      nàn zə̀ dàn               mi su
     2M insult 1SG.O reason (‘for word’) what Q
     ‘why did you insult me?’ (‘what caused you to insult me?’)A question about reason can also be marked by kə́dàn (ASSC ‘word/matter’)
followed by the question word mi and the interrogative marker:(35) mum mbə́ kə́dàn mí su
     3M come PURP what Q
     ‘why did he come?’The phrase kə́dàn also marks the affirmative clause describing the purpose of
an action (see chapter 21):(36) na mbə́ kə́dàn wum ín kwá
     1SG come PURP learn read (lit. ‘speak thing’)
     ‘I came here to learn to read’

A question about manner is indicated by the question word ma after the verb,
followed by the interrogative marker su. The question word may be preceded
by the relative marker mə̀, the conditions for which remain to be explored:(37) ha gi (mə) ma su
     2M do (REL) how Q
     ‘how do you do it?’(38) syem(ɗe) màŋ       ɗe ma su

     2M do work 2M.POSS REL how today Q
     ‘how did you work today?’ or ‘how did you do your work today?’The question word ma and the question word mi ‘what’ are interchangeable in
some constructions:(41) ha tsoɓ ma/mi      su
     2M buy how/what Q
     ‘how/what are you buying?’(42) ha tì ma/mi        su
     2M eat how/what Q
     ‘how/what are you eating?’3.5     Questions about Time
A question about the time of an event may be marked by the question word ma
‘how’ preceded by the associative preposition kə:(43) Gwà mbə́ kə      ma su
     G. come ASSC how Q
     ‘when did Gwa come?’
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M see 3M.O ASSC how Q
     ‘when did he see him?’3.6      Questions about Quantity
In a question about quantity, the phrase ma dák ‘how many/how much’ follows
the noun whose quantity is in question. As usual, the interrogative marker su
is clause-final:(45) ha tsóɓ ndaʔ ma dák                   su
     2M buy horse how many (‘what amount’) Q
     ‘how many horses did you buy?’3.7      Questions about Location
In a question about the location of an event or an entity, the question word ka
‘where’ follows the verb and precedes the interrogative marker:(46) Taú suk       ka      su
     T. stay, live where Q
     ‘where does Tau live?’(47) ha tá ka      tám su
     2M go where today Q
     ‘where did you go today?’Cf. the affirmative, where the locative complement also follows the verb:(48) ha tá lúmò

predicate, followed by su:(49) mum ka         su

     ‘where is he?’The locative question word may be preceded by the locative complement gaʔ
‘side’, apparently without changing the meaning:

4       ConclusionAll types of interrogatives in Pévé are marked by the clause-final marker su. The
polar question has the form of an affirmative clause followed by su, with gram-
matical roles and other categories marked as they are in the affirmative clause.
Content questions are marked by a set of question words that distinguish
among human referents on the one hand (sa ‘who’) and non-human, inani-
mate, or abstract constituents (mi ‘what’) on the other; manner (ma ‘how’); and
location (ka ‘where’). Further distinctions, including time, reason, and quan-
tity, are coded by prepositional phrases involving the content question words
above. The marker si occurs in a content question only when the question
expresses the speaker’s disbelief in some element of the clause. Grammatical
relations within content questions word are marked as they are in the affirma-
tive clause.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251]"

Again, its scope is the entire clause:(53) mum gã           dzuk-u
     3M freeload much-FV
     ‘he’s always freeloading (waiting for a free meal)’(54) tú     màn         ti kum        dʒuk-u

     ‘I was too sick yesterday’ (‘my body was eating me too much’)(55) yii       nə wé      ʒi gàyʔ dʒuk-u
     squirrel FOC know play gàyʔ much-FV
     ‘Squirrel knew how to play gàyʔ very well.’The modifier tʃet ‘all’ also occurs in clause-final position. When preceded by a
noun, tʃet appears to modify the noun:(56) tám tà gí tsoɓ mbìr tʃettʃet-e
     today 3F sold milk all.all-FV
     ‘today she sold all the milk’ (emphasis on ‘all’)However, tʃet may be separated from the noun by a temporal adverbial. This
suggests that the scope of tʃet, like that of ɓáyrúm, is the entire clause (this can-
not be captured in the English translation):(57) tà gí tsoɓ mbìr tám tʃet-tʃet-e
     3F sell     milk today all-all-FV
     ‘she sold all the milk today’ (not ‘she sold milk all day’)The adverbial tʃet can also be separated from the noun it modifies by a posses-
sive pronoun:(58) mum ti ɬew um         tʃet-tʃet-e
     3M ate meat 3M.POSS all-all-FV
     ‘he ate all his meat’The scope of tʃet as an adjunct that modifies the entire clause is confirmed by
the fact that tʃet follows the assertive marker si, which is usually clause-final or
followed only by a negative or interrogative marker:
                                                                       Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M ate meat 3M.POSS ASSERT all-all-FV
     ‘he ate all his meat’The form tʃet-tʃet contrasts with the form tʃẽʔtʃẽʔ, which codes repetition of the
event. Its position may be clause-initial or clause-final:(60) tʃẽʔtʃẽʔ Səray gí    sìn ɓáy tséʔ ndə́ Máy naʔ-a

     S.     make work good all like M. always-FV
     ‘Səray always works as hard as May’The adverbial kerker ‘always, all the time’ also codes repetition or duration of
the event. Use of the perfective aspect indicates that the event was bounded:(62) vay bá(r) dùkrí kerker      kə tʃiʔ-i
     baby lie night all the time with cry-FV
     ‘the baby cried all night’Recurrence of an event can be coded by the noun syem ‘foot, leg, step’ followed
by a quantifier or numeral:(63) na tá Mora syem            ráw si

probably the spatial proximate marker tòʔ ‘near the speaker’:

"6.7     Modality
The domain of modality in Pévé can be divided into two major categories: sub-
junctive and indicative. An unusual feature of Pévé is the existence of a set of
subject pronouns used exclusively in subjunctive clauses: In many cases, the
form of the subject pronoun is the only means of marking a clause as subjunc-
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
16                                                                     chapter 1tive. Other coding means within the subjunctive mood include the absence of
an overt subject and/or the form of direct/indirect object pronoun(s) used in
the clause. Interestingly, direct/indirect object pronouns used in the subjunc-
tive mood are identical with those in the perfective set, as described above. This
set of object pronouns can thus be termed the perfective/subjunctive set, in
contrast with the non-perfective/non-subjunctive set. The verb in the subjunc-
tive clause carries its underlying tone and cannot be preceded by a tense/aspect
marker.
    The subjunctive mood is subdivided into several modalities, including obli-
gation, permission, and prohibition, each marked by one of a set of clause-final
or clause-initial particles. Unlike many languages, Pévé does not make a formal
distinction between the imperative mood, i.e. a command addressed to the sec-
ond person, and the subjunctive mood, which may express desire, possibility,
obligation, and other irrealis functions. While in some languages the absence
of a subject pronoun is a marker of the imperative mood, in Pévé the subject
pronoun can be used in or omitted from both imperative clauses and clauses
marked for other subdomains within the subjunctive mood.
    Modalities within the indicative mood include the speaker’s promise or
prediction, marked by the clause-final marker ɓo, and the assertive modality,
which conveys the speaker’s belief that an event or a state did occur, is occur-
ring, could occur, or will occur. The assertive modality is marked by the mor-
pheme si, which can occur in clause- or sentence-final position or immediately
before the clause-final interrogative marker su in a polar question. The marker
si cannot be used in a negative clause.
    Pévé has also grammaticalized the counterfactual modality, marked by the
postverbal marker kə̀zə́, as a means of indicating that the subject’s belief or
wish concerning the event was unrealized or cannot be realized. Caron 2015
describes a similar function in two West Chadic languages, namely Hausa,
where the counterfactual is marked by the clause-initial conjunction dà, and
Zaar, where the counterfactual is marked by the conjunction jâːn or the con-
junction dà:, borrowed from Hausa.","[31, 32]"

tions and content questions. All interrogatives are characterized by the pres-
ence of the phrase-final particle su. The coding of grammatical roles in the
interrogative clause is the same as that in the affirmative clause, with the excep-
tion of certain verbless interrogatives concerning the identity of the deictic
subject. Content questions code the following distinctions: human constituent,
coded by sa ‘who’; non-human, inanimate or abstract constituent, coded by mi
‘what’; manner, coded by ma ‘how’; and place, coded by ka ‘where’. Further dis-
tinctions are coded by prepositional phrases involving question words, e.g. zə̀
mi ‘why’ (lit. ‘for what’), and kə ma ‘when’ (lit. ‘with how’).","[241, 242]"

         chapter 1The Pévé Language1        IntroductionThe present volume is the first full description of the grammar of Pévé, a Chadic
language spoken in parts of the southwestern area of the Republic of Chad
and the Northern province of the Republic of Cameroon. Data for this volume
were gathered in the course of fieldwork in Cameroon during the summer of
2012 and supplemented by additional data gathered from native speakers. The
present volume also draws on the works of Rodney Venberg, Herrmann Jun-
graithmayr and Michka Sachnine for additional and comparative data (section
3, below).","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"
"3.1     Speaker’s Promise: ɓo
The particle ɓo, glossed ‘PROM’ for ‘promise’, has the same distribution as the
particles ye and riʔ, discussed above: It occurs in clause-final position and can-
not occur in the same clause with another marker of mood.
    The marker ɓo in a clause marked for the future tense codes the speaker’s
promise that the event will occur. With a first-person subject, the marker ɓo
indicates a promise on the part of the speaker:(48) na də̀ tsoɓ ʒyè            wũ ne ɓo
     1SG FUT buy peanuts 2M.O ADP PROM
     ‘I will certainly buy you some peanuts.’The sentence is complete without ɓo but does not convey the same degree of
certainty:(49) na də̀ tsoɓ ʒyè         wũ ne
     1SG FUT buy peanuts 2M.O ADP
     ‘I will buy you some peanuts’The fact that the particle ɓo can be used in conjunction with the future tense
to code the speaker’s hope or promise with respect to a future event suggests
that the future tense form alone does not convey the speaker’s belief that the
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

is that the future tense marker də̀ can be omitted if ɓo is present:(50) na tsoɓ ʒyè           wũ ne ɓo
     1SG buy peanuts 2M.O ADP PROM
     ‘I (will) definitely buy you some peanuts’In a simple clause with a non-first person subject, ɓo conveys the speaker’s hope
or belief that the event will occur:(51) mum (də̀) màn ne sə̀lay ɓo
     3M FUT 1SG.O ADP money PROM
     ‘I hope/believe he (will) give me the money’Use of the particle ɓo in a negative clause indicates that the event has not yet
occurred, though the speaker believes that it will occur:(52) mum tsu màn ne sə̀lay ɓo
     3M NEG 1SG.O ADP money PROM
     ‘he has not yet given me the money (but he will)’The particle ɓo occurs in the proper name koi suk ɓo ‘Koi will survive’ (‘Koi live
PROM’) and in the following exchange of salutations:Greeting:(53) heɓ su
     peace Q
     ‘hello’ (‘at peace’)Response:(54) heɓ ɓo
     peace PROM
     ‘hello’ (‘peace is promised’)3.2     Assertive Marker si

and elicited examples. The following sections describe the form, distribution,
and function of the marker.","[184, 185]"

The marker si, analyzed here as the marker of assertive mood, can occur in
several positions: clause- or sentence-final position; the position immediately
before the clause-final interrogative marker su; or the position immediately
before a sentence-final adjunct. The implications of these possibilities are
described later in the chapter. Here are examples involving the marker si:Clause-final:(55) ndʒɪn màn          ɮɛ́ si
     ndʒin màn          ɮé si
     story 1SG.POSS start ASSERT
     ‘My story starts right now.’Before the interrogative marker:(56) ha wé      si       su
     2M know ASSERT Q
     ‘did you know (that)?’/‘did you see (that)?’The assertive marker can also be used in a question that is marked for future
tense. This provides evidence that the assertive marker does not code a func-
tion in the domain of tense (see chapter 8):(57) nambà də̀ ndewa                      ʃíw      si     su
     1PL      FUT meet (lit. ‘fall head’) tomorrow ASSERT Q
     ‘will we see each other tomorrow?’The marker si also occurs at the end of all recorded conditional protasis clauses:(58) laʔ      hi wə́      də̀ lumo si       i dʒi wa
     COND 2PL IMPF go market ASSERT 2PL.SBJV wait head
     rìn-i
     1SG.POSS-F
     ‘if you go to the market, wait for me’The assertive marker si can also occur at the end of the apodosis clause, i.e., at
the end of the complex sentence:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     COND 3M IMPF 3F.O hit ASSERT 3F.SBJV leave ASSERT
     ‘if he is hitting her, she should leave’The marker si follows some, but not all, temporal protasis clauses (see also
chapter 18):(60) kəri məni handày gí sin ndày             ndóʔ wə       ʃìnè si

     3PL     return DIR house 3PL.POSS
     ‘when they finished their work in the field, they went back home’Cf. the temporal protasis without si:(61) kəri məni ta gé ndoʔ sin sə́          ta pemãy(-a)
     when      3F finish work 3F.POSS 3F rest(-FV)
     ‘when she finished her work, she rested’The evidence that si does not mark the boundary between the protasis and the
apodosis is that si in the protasis clause can be followed by an adverbial adjunct
that modifies the preceding clause:(62) kəri məni mum làʔ      ʔwáy gàyʔ sì          dáŋʔ mum par          vay

     ‘he ate all his meat’Moreover, in the temporal construction the protasis clause (bolded in the fol-
lowing example) does not have to end in si:(64) dayna dùkri mə̀ tám (pause) handày də̀ tsòɓ ndá màn

The marker si indicates that the speaker wants the hearer to believe in the
truth or actuality of the event or state described by the clause that precedes
the marker si. The temporal status of the event or state may be the past, the
time of speech, or the future. The evidence for the assertive function is pro-
vided by examining the circumstances in which si does and does not occur and
contrasting the function of si with the functions of other morphemes and con-
structions.
    The evidence that si codes a function in the domain of affirmative modality
is that the marker cannot co-occur with the negative marker:(65) motaʔ         ɗáw tsugàk          tsùwal mi *si
     mòtaʔ (borr.) ɗáw tsú         gàk tsùwal mi *si
     car (Ful.)    one NEG can cross NEG ASSERT
     ‘Not one car could cross it.’The marker si also cannot be used in a content question that seeks additional
information about the event:(66) Taú tá ka       tám kə       bə̀kà   (*si) su
     T. go where today ASSC morning ASSERT Q
     for ‘where did Tau go this morning?’However, the marker si can be used in a polar question marked by the clause-
final interrogative su. The result is a polar question seeking confirmation of the
speaker’s assertion/belief that an event took place or will take place:(67) Taú tá lúmò tám kə             bə̀kà     si       su
     T. go market today ASSC morning ASSERT Q
     ‘did Tau (really) go to the market this morning?’The marker si cannot follow an incomplete clause:(68) ma        tʃí vun rùm-u  *si      ha mbə́ wàʔ mi su
     woman ask 3M.POSS ASSERT 2M come want what Q
     for ‘the woman asked him, “Why did you come here?” ’The evidence that the clause is incomplete is that it cannot stand alone:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     woman ask 3M.POSS ASSERT
     for ‘the woman asked him’Although si is often used in describing an event that took place in the past, it
is not a marker of tense or aspect. There are several pieces of evidence for this.
First, si can follow a clause marked for the future tense:(70) hí də̀ ndewa síw              si      su
     2PL FUT meet tomorrow ASSERT Q
     ‘will you (PL) see each other tomorrow?’(71) dayna dùkri mə̀ tám (pause) ta də̀ ge            ndoʔ sin sə́
     after night REL today               3F FUT throw finish work 3F.POSS
     si
     ASSERT
     ‘after tonight, she will finish her work’Second, si can follow a clause in the perfective aspect, marked by high tone on
the verb, or a clause in the progressive aspect, marked by the aspect marker ké.
If the marker si had a function in the domain of aspect, it would not co-occur
with other aspect markers:Perfective with si:(72) ndʒin man        ndózu       si
     ndʒin man        ndóʔ zù     sì
     story 1SG.POSS finish bottom ASSERT
     ‘My story has ended.’Progressive aspect with si:(73) Gwà ke      suk wə       Mayo-Lope si
     G. PROG stay PREP M.-L.            ASSERT
     ‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope’Evidence that si does not code the completed or bounded nature of the event
is that the marker si can follow a clause describing an ongoing state:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     G. large exceed M. ASSERT
     ‘Gwa is bigger than May’(75) tsoɓ rum          (wə̀) ke ɓáyrúm si
     price 3M.POSS IMPF COP much ASSERT
     ‘its price may be high’As previously noted, a conditional clause referring to a potential future event
must be marked by si. The conditional protasis clause describes an event or
state that may or may not occur in the future, which might seem contradictory
to the notion of the assertive modality. In fact, this explains the obligatory use of
si in the conditional protasis clause: The assertive marker advises the hearer to
believe in the content of the protasis clause, without which the apodosis would
have no validity (see chapter 18 for a description of conditional constructions):(76) laʔ        tsoɓ rum         ɓáyrúm si,      i     tsoɓ gaʔ ri məsin
     COND buy 3M.POSS much ASSERT 2PL buy side place other

     PERM
     ‘if its price is high, you can buy it somewhere else’(77) ha laʔ       waʔ fun si,        a mbə ye
     2M COND want boule ASSERT 2M.SBJV come PERM
     ‘if you want boule, come here!’(78) May ɗík      i      ta gak       gəɓo mota kəzə si    ama
     M. believe COMP 3F be able drive car CF ASSERT but (Ar.)
     ta gak     mi
     3F be able NEG
     ‘May thought she could drive a car, but she couldn’t’Perhaps the strongest evidence for the function of the marker si is the follow-
ing example, where si occurs at the end of a clause describing a potential event
that did not actually occur. The presence of si advises the hearer to believe that
the event could have occurred. The marker kə̀zə́, glossed CF for ‘counterfactual’,
indicates the speaker’s knowledge that the event did not actually occur. The
scope of the assertive mood is thus the speaker’s wish for the hearer’s belief,
not the speaker’s own belief or knowledge with respect to whether the event
or state actually took place in the real world:

         chapter 9Mood and Modality1        IntroductionThis chapter describes forms and functions in the domains of deontic and epis-
temic modality in Pévé. In most grammatical descriptions, deontic modality is
taken to include the imperative mood, typically described as commands to the
second person, and the subjunctive mood, typically described as expressing
desire, possibility, obligation, and other irrealis propositions. Unlike many lan-
guages, Pévé does not make a formal distinction between the imperative mood
and the subjunctive mood. Coding means such as the presence or absence of
an overt subject marker and the use of a dedicated set of subject pronouns
differentiate subjunctive clauses from indicative clauses in Pévé but do not dif-
ferentiate commands from other functions in the deontic mood. For simplicity,
the term ‘subjunctive (mood)’ is used to refer to commands to the second per-
son as well as clauses expressing permission, obligation, expectation, etc. with
respect to any person, from the speaker’s perspective.
   Means of coding the subjunctive mood include the choice of subject pro-
noun, the absence of an overt subject, and the use of object pronouns from
the perfective/subjunctive set. Subcategories within the subjunctive, such as
permission, obligation, and others, are marked by clause-final or clause-initial
particles (see below). The verb in the subjunctive mood is unmarked in that it
carries its underlying tone and is not preceded by a tense or aspect marker.
   The primary difference between epistemic modality and the subjunctive
mood, as described in this chapter, is that pronouns used in the epistemic
modality are from the indicative set, not the subjunctive set, and that markers
of epistemic modality may co-occur with various markers of tense or aspect.
The subjunctive mood, in contrast, uses only pronouns from the subjunctive
set (chapter 6) and can co-occur only with the unmarked tense/aspect. The
present chapter begins with a description of the subjunctive mood and a num-
ber of subdomains within the subjunctive mood, functions of which include
the speaker’s prohibition of an event, the speaker’s statement of obligation
concerning an event, and the speaker’s statement of permission concerning an
event. The latter part of the chapter describes two subdomains within the epis-
temic mood, referred to tentatively as ‘promise mood’ and ‘assertive mood’. The
promise mood, as used in the present work, conveys the speaker’s certainty that
a future event will take place. The assertive mood, as used in this work, conveys

is occurring or will occur (see Palmer 2001 for discussion of the assertive func-
tion). The function of the assertive marker in Pévé, marked by the clause-final
morpheme si (glossed ‘ASSERT’), resembles the function of certain markers in
other languages, such as lè in Giziga (Shay 2012, ms.), za in Mina (Frajzyngier
and Johnston with Edwards 2005), and náx in Kapsiki (Smith 1969). Whether
the function of si in Pévé directly corresponds with the functions of markers
in other languages remains an open question. Other subdomains within the
domain of epistemic modality are described separately in chapter 18 (condi-
tional and temporal constructions) and chapter 19 (complementation).","[172, 173, 174]"

AcknowledgmentsI am extremely grateful to Lazare Wambadang, a native speaker of Pévé who
is also fluent in French and English and without whom the present project
could not have been accomplished. Wambadang has selflessly devoted a great
amount of time and energy to describing and analyzing Pévé and creating
the present volume, and his enthusiasm has been an important part of the
project. I am also grateful to the American Council of Learned Societies, which
provided significant financial support for the project. I sincerely thank Henry
Tourneux, who provided essential logistical and personal support before and
during the fieldwork; Venasius Lendzemo and Noë Woin of the Institute de
Récherche Agricole pour le Développement (IRAD) in Cameroon, who also
provided logistical support for the fieldwork; Rodney Venberg, who has very
generously shared his own work on Pévé and provided many helpful comments
regarding the present work; the kind and supportive staff at Le Relais de la
Porte Mayo in Maroua; and Zygmunt Frajzyngier, whose assistance was crucial
before, during, and after the fieldwork and who provided much thoughtful and
detailed advice concerning the present work. Praat software (http://www.fon
.hum.uva.nl/praat/) was extremely useful for analyzing tone in the texts that
are the basis of the grammatical analysis. I also thank the publisher’s reviewer
for useful questions and suggestions concerning the document, all of which
have been taken into account in the final version.
    I greatly admire the Pévé people for striving to maintain their language and
culture through peaceful measures despite social, political and changes of a
kind that have led to the loss of languages over centuries and across the world.
I sincerely hope that the present volume will be of use to native and non-native
speakers of Pévé and to speakers of languages that are related to, or have been in
contact with, the Pévé language. Because collaborator Wambadang is a native
speaker of Pévé, any errors in the transcription, translation or analysis of Pévé
are mine.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"6.19     Comparative Constructions
Comparative constructions compare the properties or actions of one argument
(the target) with those of another argument (the basis). The property or action
involved is referred to as the standard of comparison. Coding means in com-
parative constructions include the comparative marker ndə́ ‘like’, which indi-
cates equal comparison, and the verb pã ‘exceed, surpass’, which indicates that
the target exceeds the basis. When the basis exceeds the target, comparison is
marked by a negative clause involving the verb dày ‘to reach, to arrive’ and the
clause-final negative marker mí. Grammaticalization of the verb dày ‘reach’ as
a marker of comparison is unusual in Chadic languages.",[37]

Pévé-English Lexicon1        IntroductionThe Pévé-English lexicon in this chapter is organized according to the International
Phonetic Alphabet, with some additions and exceptions. In general, the order of vow-
els as entered in the lexicon is i, e, ə, a, o, and u; the consonant or fricative (e.g. ndz,
ʃ ) precedes the palatalized form (ndʒ, ʃy); and the non-glottalized form (b, d) precedes
the glottalized form (ɓ, ɗ ). Because some existing written works on Pévé do not use IPA
symbols, the symbols used in those works are shown in brackets after the correspond-
ing IPA symbols, such as ɓ [b’], dʒ [j, dž]. Abbreviations are used in the lexicon as they
are in the text.
    As shown in chapter 2 (Phonology), there are a number of free variations in pro-
nunciation, especially in morphemes that begin with a stop or fricative followed by a
high or mid front vowel. In the Pévé-English lexicon, the Pévé form in the left-hand col-
umn represents the native speaker’s perception of the underlying form, e.g. ʃinè ‘field’,
while the form in the right-hand column of the English-Pévé lexicon (chapter 24) may
include the underlying form and free variations as transcribed by the author, e.g. ʃinè
or sine.
    Needless to say, the two lexicons do not represent a complete list of lexical items and
morphemes in the Pévé language; there are many more to be examined and described.
The items listed below represent those attested in the data and others whose forms
and/or translations may be of interest to the reader.","[346, 347, 348]"
"
2       SubjectThe subject is defined here as the sole argument of an intransitive verb or the
controlling argument of a transitive verb. The defining features of the subject
argument in Pévé are as follows: (1) the subject noun or pronoun always pre-
cedes the verb, although other material may intervene between subject and
verb, and (2) the pronominal subject is represented by a member of a unique
set of pronouns that code a distinction between pronouns used in indica-
tive clauses and pronouns used in subjunctive clauses. Both subject pronoun
sets are distinct from the pronouns that represent direct and indirect objects.
Nearly every clause has a subject noun or pronoun. Exceptions to this rule
are some imperative clauses (commands addressed to the second person) and
some clauses in which the subject referent is a known entity (see chapter 12).
   The grammatical relation ‘subject’ does not imply a particular semantic rela-
tionship. The subject may be controlling or non-controlling, animate or inani-
mate, without further marking:(1) dʒwə fáŋ        ʔya    ɮé
    chief repeat depart pass
    ‘the chief left again’(2) ndʒɪn màn           ɮɛ́ si

coding grammatical relations                                                  105   Although the noun or pronoun representing the subject always precedes the
verb, much material may occur between the subject noun or pronoun and the
verb. This material includes independent markers of tense, aspect or negation:(4) ta də̀ də̀ lúmò
    3F FUT go market
    ‘she will go to the market’(5) ta wə́      də̀ lúmò
    3F IMPF go market
    ‘she is going to the market’(6) Taú tsú tá lúmò tám kə              bə̀kà  mì
    T. NEG go market today ASSC morning NEG
    ‘Tau didn’t go to the market this morning’A temporal adverb may also intervene between subject and verb, as may a deic-
tic demonstrative indicating location:(7) dʒwa gwaʔ tʃí vun rùm-u
    chief then ask 3M.POSS-FV
    ‘then the chief asked him’(8) ɓay na ni          fáŋ mbə́
    CONJ 1SG PROX repeat come
    ‘so I came back here’Even the conditional marker may intervene between subject and verb:(9) hə́ŋ làʔ      gí    kwáti ndóʔ si,          nambà də̀ ti
    2F COND made food finish ASSERT 1PL               FUT eat
    ‘if you have finished cooking, we will eat’In some tenses and aspects, as described in sections 3 and 4 below, the sub-
ject noun or pronoun can be separated from the verb by a noun or pronoun
representing another argument:(10) na də̀ ùm gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn-à
     1SG FUT 3M.O sell        cow 1SG.POSS-FV
     ‘I will sell him my cow’
                                                                 Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
106                                                                  chapter 6   In the following examples the subject pronoun is separated from the verb by
the negative marker, the future-tense marker, and a pronoun representing the
recipient of the event:(11) na tsú də̀ ùm gì tsòɓ ya naw màn ne mì
     1SG NEG FUT 3M.O sell         cow 1POSS ADP NEG
     ‘I will not sell him my cow.’(12) mum tsú də̀ sə́ tsòɓ ne mi
     3M NEG FUT 3F.O buy ADP NEG
     ‘he will not buy (it) for her’The pronoun representing the direct object can also occur between the subject
and the verb:(13) mum tsú də̀ um/sə́            tsoɓ síw mì
     3M NEG FUT 3M.O/3F.O buy tomorrow NEG
     ‘he will not buy it tomorrow’The fact that many lexical and grammatical items can occur between the sub-
ject and the verb raises the question of whether the position before the verb
is the coding means for the subject or whether sentence-initial position is the
coding means for the subject. However, the subject does not have to be the first
element of the sentence, as it can be preceded by the conditional marker or a
temporal adverbial:(14) làʔ      hə́ŋ gí    kwáti ndóʔ si           nambà də̀ ti
     COND 2F made food finish ASSERT 1PL               FUT eat
     ‘if you have finished cooking, we will eat’ (same meaning as example 9,
     above)(15) kəri rùm         handày fáŋ káw                  Taobay
     time 3M.POSS 3PL          arrest (‘repeat grab’) T.
     ‘Then they arrested Taobay.’ (For the use of kəri rùm in conditional con-
     structions, see chapter 18.):In the following text fragment the sentence beginning with ɓay has no con-
nection with the preceding sentence apart from the fact that it follows that
sentence in discourse. This demonstrates that ɓay is sentence-initial and pre-
cedes the subject pronoun:
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘All of us, we were very tired. And we got into Garoua at eight o’clock in
     the morning.’The subject role of the noun phrase is thus coded by the position somewhere
before the verb, though not necessarily in sentence-initial position. When more
than one argument precedes the verb (see sections 3.2 and 4.2), the subject is
the first of those arguments.","[120, 121, 122, 123]"

3       ConclusionPévé is an active language whose speakers are well aware of the need to pre-
serve their language, cultural activities, and intercultural relations in a world
in which political, social, and economic affairs can lead to the loss of language
and traditions. The goal of the present work is to document and preserve some
of the interesting and important characteristics of Pévé for the benefit of gen-
erations to come. With respect to nomenclature, the present work adopts the
educated native-speaker Wambadang’s view that Pévé is a language distinct
from Zimé; that the term Lamé also refers to Pévé; that dialects of Pévé include
Dari, Doué, and perhaps others; that (Vun) Dzəbao, Gumaji and Herdé may
be either remote dialects of Pévé or pidgin languages that are influenced by
both Pévé and Mesme (Chadic, East Branch); and that the term Kaʔɗó (and
its variants) is not acceptable as a name for the Pévé language or culture. The
present work does not attempt to answer further questions about classification
but focuses instead on lexical and grammatical forms in Pévé and the functions
they encode.
    While Pévé shares many forms and functions with other languages of the
Chadic family, particularly those of the Masa branch, the Pévé language also has
a number of unique or unusual features. One such feature is that the choice of
pronoun(s) in a given clause is often the only means of indicating the temporal,
aspectual, and/or modal properties of the clause. In other words, the language
has a number of distinct sets of pronouns whose function is not only to indi-
cate the gender, number and syntactic role of a participant but also the tense,
aspect or mood of the clause. Despite the large system of pronouns, the gram-
matical gender system is limited to singular second- and third-person pronouns
and a small set of nouns that are inherently feminine or masculine. Another
interesting feature of Pévé is that the scope of the negative clause is that of the
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

ture is that while Pévé has a rich system of reference that distinguishes among
anaphoric, deictic, and deducible referents, nouns in Pévé are rarely marked for
number (singular or plural). The language also has a rich system of modality
that includes the unusual counterfactual mood, whereby a dedicated marker
indicates that the event described in the proposition did not occur.","[38, 39]"

Focus on the subject is marked by the marker kə followed by the relative marker
mə and a resumptive pronoun coding the gender of the head. The difference
between the focus clause and the relative clause lies in the marker kə́ after the
focused subject. The source of the marker kə́ is an open question, as the form
bears similarity to both the copula kè and the associative preposition kə:(10) mum kə́ mə̀ ni tsóɓ ya nãw àmá na tsú mì
     3M FOC REL PRO buy cow but 1SG NEG NEG
     ‘it’s he who bought the cow, not I’(11) mum kə́ mə̀ ni bay màn-a
     3M FOC REL PRO friend 1SG.POSS-FV
     ‘it is he who is my friend’Compare with the relative clause, where the head is not followed by kə:(12) swə mə̀ ni ɬé nàn mbə́ ti              kə  ndi nə̀ bay
     man REL PRO take 1SG.O come here ASSC OP POST friend
     màn-à
     1SG.POSS-FV
     ‘the man who brought me here is my friend’When the focused entity is a proper noun, focus is marked by a determiner fol-
lowing the proper noun:(13) ɓay Taobay nə           gàʔ gazù
     ɓay Taobay nə           gaʔ ka   su
     CONJ T.         DED.M side which Q
     ‘“So where is this Taobay?”’3.2     Focus on the Object
As shown in chapter 6, a previously mentioned inanimate object is usually not
overtly marked. When an object pronoun is used to refer an inanimate argu-
ment, this places the argument in focus:(14) na ti sə́/nùm        kúm-ú
     1SG ate 3F.O/3M.O yesterday-FV
     ‘I ate it yesterday’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M IMPF 3F.O buy 1SG.O ADP
     ‘he is buying it for me’Cf. the non-focused form, where the direct object is unmarked:(16) na tsóɓ        kúm(-ú)
     1SG bought yesterday
     ‘I bought (it) yesterday’In some examples focus on the object is coded by the juxtaposition of an affir-
mative and a negative clause pertaining to the same event, where each clause
has a different overt object. The following sentence is a Pévé translation of the
English form ‘he bought a cow, not a goat’:(17) mum tsóɓ ya nãw (pause) mum tsú tsóɓ ya hu mí
     3M buy cow                 3M NEG buy fem. goat NEG
     ‘he bought a cow; he did not buy a female goat’3.3     Focus on the Adjunct
In the next three examples, focus on the temporal adjunct (see chapter 21) is
marked by the clause-final impersonal pronoun na, which indicates that the
adjunct is an independent equational clause (cf. chapter 11). The marker ni
codes proximity to the time of speech. The English translation is intended to
convey the meaning, though it may not reflect the order of constituents in Pévé:(18) mgbaŋ ni         na    ì           də̀ ɗe nùm ye
     now PROX I.PRO 2PL.SBJV FUT call 3M.O PERM
     ‘it is now that you should call him’(19) i           də̀ ɗe nùm kə          fə̀tà ni na

     T. go market ASSC morning PROX I.PRO
     ‘Tau went to the market this morning’The sentence is acceptable without the sequence ni na, but there is no indica-
tion of focus:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     T. go market ASSC morning
     ‘Tau went to the market this morning’
4       ConclusionA non-subject constituent is topicalized by fronting. The role of the topical-
ized constituent as the inanimate direct object of the comment clause is not
overtly marked within the clause. When the fronted non-subject argument is
not the direct object of the comment clause, the argument is marked by the
phrase dàn Noun DED, where DED is a deducible reference marker indicating
the gender of the head (i.e. topicalized) noun. The topicalized subject of a ver-
bal clause may be marked as the head of a relative clause, with the grammatical
role of the topicalized subject indicated by a resumptive pronoun within the
comment clause. Another means of indicating topicalization is a pause after
the topicalized constituent.
   Pévé does not distinguish between contrastive and non-contrastive focus.
Means of coding focus include the preposition kə followed by the relative
marker mə and a resumptive pronoun referring to the focused constituent;
overt marking of a constituent that is normally understood, such as the pre-
viously mentioned inanimate direct object; and the impersonal pronoun na,
which places the constituent in focus by marking it as an independent clause.","[259, 260, 261, 262]"

Direct and indirect object pronouns used in a subjunctive clause are from the
perfective object pronoun set (see section 1, above, and also chapter 6):(14) à          pum nùm ye
     2M.SBJV hit 3M.O PERM
     ‘hit him!’(15) à         ne nàn riʔ-i
     2M.SBJV give 1SG.O already-FV
     ‘you should/may give it to me’ (request, permission)Cf. the same pronouns in the indicative perfective clause:(16) swə          púm nùm-u
     man/person hit 3M.O-FV
     ‘someone hit him’(17) mum ne nùm ne nàn-a
     3M give 3M.O ADP 1SG.O-FV
     ‘he gave it to me’The verb of the subjunctive clause may be followed by an object pronoun from
the perfective-subjunctive object set that reflects the person and number of
the addressee, resulting in dual reference to the subject. Use of a coreferen-
tial object pronoun in a subjunctive construction involving only one entity,
the addressee, conveys the speaker’s belief that the addressee will be indirectly
affected by the command or wish expressed by the speaker. This function is
similar to that of ‘self’ in English constructions such as ‘get yourself over here!’
or ‘have yourself a sandwich!’:(18) ì         mbə̀ ni ti   ríʔ-i

ject set is the only means of indicating the person and number of the referent:(20) mbə̀ ni ríʔ-i

     ‘come (PL)!’(21) ta nu        ye

     ‘eat!’2.2     Clause-Final Particles in the Subjunctive Mood
In nearly all elicited and natural discourse examples, a clause in the subjunctive
mood has a clause-initial or clause-final particle that conveys urgency, obli-
gation, permission, or politeness from the speaker’s perspective. The attested

         chapter 6Coding Grammatical Relations1        IntroductionThe term ‘grammatical relations’ refers here to the functional relations between
the verb and the noun phrase(s) in a clause. These relations include the sub-
ject, the object, and the indirect object, as defined in sections below. As stated
in chapter 1, in the pronoun set there is no distinction between direct object
pronouns and indirect object pronouns. The terms ‘direct object’ and ‘indirect
object’, as used in the present chapter, thus refer to the grammatical relations
between the verb and its arguments rather than to the form of the pronoun that
represents an argument. Because there is no direct vs. indirect object distinc-
tion within the pronoun system, a pronoun that may represent either a direct
object or an indirect object is referred to simply as an object pronoun, glossed
as O for ‘Object’.
    In addition to subject vs. object pronoun distinctions, the grammatical rela-
tionship between a given noun phrase and the verb can be coded by one or
more of the following means: the position of the noun phrase with respect to
the verb; the position of the noun phrase with respect to another noun phrase;
the indirect object marker ne (glossed ‘ADP’ for ‘adposition’), derived from the
verb ‘to give’; the associative preposition kə; a pronoun coding a specific gram-
matical relation; and the position of a pronoun with respect to another noun
phrase or pronoun. Pronouns are neither prefixes nor suffixes, and there is no
coding of grammatical relations on the verb itself or on the noun stem. Pévé
also has an impersonal pronoun, na, whose functions in the domains of ref-
erence and complementation resemble the functions of ‘that’, ‘it’ and certain
other forms in English. The form na and its functions are discussed in chapters
11 and 19.
    An important feature of Pévé is that the coding of grammatical relations
is inseparable from the coding of tense, aspect, and mood. Different linear
orders and different pronoun forms are used in different tenses, aspects, and
moods, and in some cases the choice of pronoun form and/or the linear order
of constituents is the only means of coding tense, aspect, or mood (see chap-
ters 8–10). With respect to the subject argument, the primary distinction is
between the indicative mood and the subjunctive mood. With respect to all
other arguments, the primary distinction is between the perfective aspect and
the subjunctive mood on the one hand and all other tenses, aspects, and moods

‘non-perfective’. The interaction of grammatical relations with other means of
coding tense, aspect, and mood is explored further in later chapters.
   This chapter describes the means of coding the grammatical relations sub-
ject, object, and indirect object in perfective and non-perfective simple sen-
tences. The interaction of grammatical relations and mood is further discussed
in chapter 9. The coding of grammatical relations in negative clauses is ad-
dressed in chapter 14, and the coding of grammatical relations in complex
sentences is addressed in chapter 19.","[118, 119, 120]"

verbless and copular predications                                                 199Furthermore, like other verbs (see chapter 8), kè carries high tone when the
clause refers to a time before the time of speech:(17) ta ké bay màn-à
     3F COP friend 1SG-FV
     ‘she was my friend’In an equational predication with future time reference, the copula has low
tone and is preceded by the future tense marker də̀, providing further evidence
that kè is a verb while na is not:(18) ta də̀ kè bay màn-a
     3F FUT COP friend 1SG-FV
     ‘she will be my friend’Cf. the form with reference to the time of speech (recall that na is not necessary
in an equational clause of the form Pronoun Noun):(19) ta bay màn-a
     3F friend 1SG-FV
     ‘she is my friend’As previously mentioned, the clause-final impersonal pronoun na rarely co-
occurs with another clause-final marker. A content question about the identity
of a human participant (see chapter 13) has the form of an equational predica-
tion whose predicate is the content question word sa ‘who’. The clause-final
impersonal pronoun na does not occur, since the clause-final interrogative
marker su itself marks the end of the clause:(20) ta sa su
     3F who Q
     ‘who is she?’ (lit. ‘she [is] who?’)A question about a non-human participant has mi ‘what’ as the subject and
a deictic demonstrative as the predicate. The relative marker mə before the
demonstrative is optional and the impersonal pronoun na does not occur:(21) mi (mə)ni su
     what PROX Q
     ‘what [is] this?’
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     what DIST.M Q
     ‘what [is] that?’3.2      Pronoun as Predicate
An equational predication with a pronoun as predicate corresponds to ‘X is
mine/yours/his/hers’, etc. Unlike the English translation, the pronoun serving
as predicate in Pévé is from the set of indicative subject pronouns (see chap-
ter 6), not the set of possessive pronouns. The pronoun serving as predicate is
preceded by the relative marker mə̀. A clause-final marker, such as the imper-
sonal pronoun na, must be used to indicate that the sequence Subject mə̀ Pro-
noun clause is an independent clause (see section 2, above):(23) ya nãw kunə mə nambà na
     cow PL REL 1PL        I.PRO
     ‘those cows are ours’vs.(24) ya nãw kunə mə nambà
     cow PL REL 1PL
     ‘our cows there …’The equational predication with a pronoun as predicate is distinct from the
attributive clause, in which the pronoun modifies the subject (see section 4,
below). In the attributive clause, the modifying pronoun is from the possessive
set:(25) ya nãw man          na
     cow 1SG.POSS I.PRO
     ‘it/that is my cow’Cf. the equational predication, with an indicative subject pronoun:(26) yá nãw mə̀ na na
     cow REL 1SG I.PRO
     ‘the cow is mine’A clause-final marker, such as the negative mì or an added final vowel, can also
mark the end of the equational clause, rendering the phrase-final impersonal
pronoun na unnecessary:                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘he never buys mine (‘what is mine’); he only buys yours’ (‘what is yours’)
4        Attributive PredicationThe attributive predication is a verbless clause of the form Noun/Pronoun
Modifier, where the modifier denotes an attribute of the subject noun or pro-
noun. Like other verbless predications, the attributive predication must end
with a clause-final marker, which may consist of an added final vowel (FV) or a
marker that is inherently clause-final. In the next example, the marker of com-
pleteness is the clause-final assertive marker sí (cf. chapter 9):(28) Sə́ráy jáŋ sí
     S.       tall ASSERT
     ‘Sə́ ráy is tall’Without the assertive marker, the construction cannot stand alone and there-
fore cannot act as an attributive predication:(29) Sə́ráy jáŋ
     S.       tall
     ‘tall Sə́ rá …’A phrase-final added vowel (see chapter 3) is sometimes the sole marker of
completeness of the predication:(30) ta bròʔ-o
     3F ugly-FV
     ‘she is ugly’(31) mum ɗáw sar-a
     3M one only-FV
     ‘he is alone’(32) ya ndaʔ                    rə    uraʔ-a
     mare (lit. ‘female horse’) DED.F black-FV
     ‘that mare is black’                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     mare (lit. ‘female horse’) DED.F black
     ‘that black mare …’An attributive predicate that is not an inherent modifier must be overtly
marked for the modifying function. For example, a noun that functions as a
modifier is preceded by the relative marker mə̀. The resulting construction is
not a relative clause (see chapter 17). The evidence for this is that the attribu-
tive predication, unlike the relative clause, can stand alone as an independent
clause:(34) ya nãw mə̀ ɓú
     cow REL whiteness
     ‘the cow is white’ (not ‘the cow that is white …’)The chief formal difference between the relative clause and an attributive
predication with a nominal predicate is the lack of a resumptive pronoun in
the attributive predication. With the resumptive pronoun ti, the construction
serves as a relative clause rather than an independent attributive clause. The
relative clause cannot function as an independent clause:(35) ya nãw mə̀ ti       ɓú
     cow REL PRO whiteness
     ‘the cow that is white …’The difference between the relative clause and the attributive predication is
further illustrated by the next example. The first instance of the form mə̀ marks
the verb phrase tà kə syem ‘walks on legs’ as an attribute of the subject kwá
‘thing’. There is no resumptive pronoun within the phrase, so the phrase is
attributive. The attributive phrase [kwá mə̀ tà kə syem] is itself the head of a
larger clause that is marked by the second instance of mə̀. The evidence that the
larger clause is a relative clause and not an attributive clause is that the marker
mə̀ in the larger clause is followed by the masculine resumptive pronoun ni. The
end of the relative clause is marked by the masculine post-relative marker nə̀
(chapter 17), which does not occur in the attributive clause. The lengthy relative
clause kwá … nə̀ in turn functions as the subject of a larger attributive predica-
tion whose predicate is kəlìŋ ‘rat’. The status of the sentence as an independent
identificational clause is marked by the clause-final impersonal pronoun na:
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘the animal (‘thing walking on legs’) that we saw, it is a rat’As is the case in equational and identificational constructions, the attributive
clause with past or future time reference is marked by the copula kè. The copula
has high tone in reference to past time:(37) ta ké ɓáy kum               àmá        tám ta tsú ɓáy zaʔ mi
     3F COP pretty yesterday but (Ar.) today 3F NEG pretty still NEG
     ‘she was pretty yesterday, but she is not pretty today’Cf. the same notion with reference to the time of speech, where kè does not
occur:(38) ta ɓáy

the copula and the copula carries its underlying low tone:(41) tsoɓ rum də̀ kè ɓáyrúm
     price 3M FUT COP much
     ‘its price will be high’

corresponding to English ‘to have’ or its equivalent in other Indo-European lan-
guages. The possessive predication has the form Possessor kə Possessum (the
thing possessed), where kə is the associative preposition:(42) ta kə     sə̀lay-a
     3F ASSC money-FV
     ‘she has money’ (lit. ‘she (is) with money’)(43) ta tsú kə       sə̀lày mì
     3F NEG ASSC money NEG
     ‘she does not have money’The attribute ‘hot’ is also conveyed by a possessive construction:(44) fún           nə       kə      ku
     boule/food PROX ASSC heat, fire
     ‘this food is hot’ (lit. ‘with heat’)The inanimate subject does not have to be overtly marked in the clause, pro-
vided the subject is understood:(45) kə       ku
     ASSC heat, fire
     ‘(it) is hot’The resemblance between the copula kè and the associative preposition kə
might suggest a path of evolution from one function to the other, but this is
rendered unlikely by the fact that the two markers can be used together, each
retaining its own function:(46) namba ké kə́       sə̀lay-a
     1PL     COP ASSC money-FV
     ‘we used to have money’

vowel, the interrogative marker su, the assertive marker si, the clause-final
impersonal pronoun na, and perhaps other means of marking the end of a
clause. Verbless clauses are attested in the domains of identificational pred-
ication, equational predication, and attributive predication. The impersonal
pronoun na is used in such predications only if the clause in question refers
to a state or event that exists or takes place at the time of speech. If the clause
refers to a point in time before or after the time of speech, the clause is marked
instead by the copula kè. Like other verbs, the copula carries high tone in the
perfective function and is preceded by the marker də́ in the future tense func-
tion. The absence of the copula kè, the impersonal pronoun na, or some other
means of marking the end of a clause renders the verbless clause a dependent
phrase that cannot stand alone.","[214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221]"

2        Equal ComparisonThe equal comparison construction corresponding to ‘Noun1 is like Noun2’ is
marked by the comparative marker ndə́ after the target (N1) and before the basis
(N2). The impersonal pronoun na in clause-final position marks the compara-
tive construction as an independent clause, just as it marks the sequence Noun
Noun or Noun Adjective as an independent (equational) clause:(1) də́ ndə́ índù na

    ‘the dog is like the hyena’Without na, the clause is incomplete:(2) də́ ndə́ índù

ndə́:(6) varìrkwayrùm              gi ndə́ naʔ

3       Unequal ComparisonAll attested constructions involving unequal comparison are verbal clauses,
even when the standard of comparison is represented by a modifier describing
an attribute. The modifier representing the standard follows the target noun.
When the target exceeds the basis with respect to the standard, the standard is
followed by the verb pã ‘to exceed, to surpass’, marked for the perfective aspect.
This is a common means of coding unequal comparison in Chadic:(8) Gwà toŋ pã ́       May si
    G. large exceed M. ASSERT
    ‘Gwa is bigger than May.’
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

    ‘Səray is smaller than Tau’(10) Taú mbúɗ pã ́       Kóm sì
     T. grow exceed K. ASSERT
     ‘Tau is taller than Kom’When the basis exceeds the target with respect to the standard of compari-
son, the clause is a negative clause with the verb dày ‘to arrive’ in the perfective
aspect. The adjective describing the attribute modifies the subject (target). This
grammaticalization of the verb dày is unusual in Chadic:(11) Sə́ráy tsú mbúɗ dáy Taú mí
     S.     NEG grow arrive T. NEG
     ‘Səray is not as tall as Tau’The same structures apply when the standard of comparison is an action. When
the target exceeds the basis, the verb pã follows the verb referring to the stan-
dard:(12) Sə́ráy wə́   gí     sin pã ́ Máy sì
     S.     IMPF make work exceed M. ASSERT
     ‘Səray works harder than Máy’(13) Sə́ráy wə́   gí     sin brò pã ́        Taú sì
     S.     IMPF make work bad exceed T. ASSERT
     ‘Səray works worse than Tau’ (i.e., does not work as well)When the basis exceeds the target, the verb dày ‘arrive’ follows the verb and the
clause is negated:(14) Sə́ráy tsú wə́      gí    sin ɓáy dày Taú mì
     S.     NEG IMPF make work good arrive T. NEG

Chadic languages.","[312, 313, 314, 315]"
"Despite the availability of tone as a coding means, there are many homonyms
within and across lexical and grammatical categories:

ri      ‘to cut with a sickle’ or ‘place’, ‘time’
tà      ‘to walk’ or 3F subject pronounGrammatical morphemes, and lexical items other than verbs, retain their
underlying tone in the surface form. While stress and intonation patterns may
affect the perceived tone, such changes are not contrastive. Clause-final parti-
cles such as the interrogative marker su and the assertive marker si may carry
high, mid or low tone, depending on the tone of the preceding morpheme, into-
nation, stress patterns, and other factors. The same is true of phrase-final added
vowels (see chapter 3), which may or may not carry the same tone as the pre-
ceding vowel. It is also possible that some grammatical particles do not actually
have an underlying tone. Because the present volume is authored by a native
speaker of Pévé and a linguist who is not a Pévé speaker, there are instances
in which the linguist and the native speaker have different perceptions of tone,
resulting in apparent inconsistencies in transcriptions used in the text. Further
studies will be necessary to discover the language-external causes for such vari-
ations in tone.
   Verbs are the only category in which tone carries a grammatical function, as
opposed to a lexical function. Each syllable in a verb carries a tone, which may
be high, mid or low. The surface tone of the verb is an important factor in the
coding of tense and aspect. The primary distinction is between the perfective
aspect, coded by high tone on the verb, and all other tenses and aspects, where
the verb retains its underlying (also called unmarked) tone. In the independent
clause, tenses and aspects other than the perfective are coded by independent
markers that are not part of the verb. For example, the verb ti ‘to eat’ has under-
lying mid tone. High tone on the verb marks the perfective aspect:(31) na tí        fun
     1SG eat.PERF food
     ‘I ate’Other aspects are marked by independent morphemes and the verb with its

     ‘I will eat’The subjunctive mood is marked by a dedicated set of subjunctive subject pro-
nouns (see chapters 5 and 9). The verb carries its underlying tone, with no
additional markers:(34) à           ne         ye
     2M.SBJV run/give PERM
     ‘run!’ or ‘give!’ (SBJV: subjunctive; PERM: permission (see chapter 9))Compare with the perfective, coded by high tone and the use of a subject pro-
noun from the indicative set:(35) ha né si
     2M run ASSERT
     ‘you ran/fled’In natural discourse, it appears that the high tone that marks the perfective
aspect may not be absolute but may be relative to the morpheme that pre-
cedes the verb. When the syllable preceding the verb has low tone, the verb
marked for perfective aspect sometimes has what would appear to be mid tone
in other environments. This observation is based on the examination of pitch
using audio recordings and the Praat program (http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/
praat/). After a morpheme with mid tone, the perfective verb often has higher
pitch than the perfective verb after a morpheme with low tone. In the follow-
ing example, both instances of the perfective form nyén, preceded by a syllable
with mid tone, have high pitch and are therefore marked for high tone:(36) mota        nyén dapà gaʔ tʃɪɓáyrúm               ɓaĩyén        dàpà gaʔ …

     ‘Cars filled the banks on this side and that side (the other side) as well.’2 The use of the adverbial tòʔ, meaning ‘near the speaker’, is an error when used with the phrase
  gaʔ dayʔ ‘that side’. However, the adverbial tòʔ can be used with the phrase gaʔ ti ‘this side’.","[65, 66, 67]"

4       Function of Final Vowel AdditionThe function of the phrase-final added vowel in Pévé is to indicate that the
preceding morphological, lexical or grammatical unit is complete as far as the
speaker is concerned and should be interpreted as such. This can be viewed
as a subdomain within the domain of parsing morphology as described in Fra-
jzyngier 2016b, though it differs from the function of parsing morphology in
Wandala.
    In Pévé, phrase-final vowel addition is not determined by whether or not
the phrase, clause, or sentence with the final vowel is grammatically com-
plete. In the following fragment, the first instantiation of the noun dzənàk
‘guinea fowl’ has a phrase-final vowel because the phrase kəri məní, which fol-
lows dzənàk-à, is always clause-initial. In other words, whatever precedes kəri
məní must be marked as phrase-final regardless of whether or not it could
function as a grammatically correct independent utterance. To put it another
way, adding the final vowel to dzənàk indicates that the word dzənàk should
be interpreted as a component of what has gone before and not what fol-
lows.
    The second instantiation of dzənàk in the following example has no phrase-
final vowel. This can be explained by the fact that the demonstrative plural kunə
modifies dzənàk and so is part of the same unit, which may or may not be gram-
matically complete. Similarly, the final /ə/ in kunə is explained by the fact that it
is followed by the assertive marker si, which occurs only in phrase-final position
(recall that kunə becomes kun-a in phrase-final position). The phrase-internal
forms dzənàk and kunə thus tell the listener to expect more information within
                                                                       Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

expect more information within the same unit of the utterance:(33) brògò …            ʔyá táy    gi tsoɓ də̀bãwə        só

     ‘Monitor Lizard went to sell tobacco in the village of the guinea fowls.
     When he got to the village of the guinea fowls, he found them sitting
     under a tree.’In the next example, the initial clause nambà gáyʔ vun ʒè nə (‘we stayed at
the riverbank’) is grammatically complete and could be used in isolation if
the form nə (/n/+epenthic vowel), which signals that the head noun refers to
a known entity, were changed to n-a. The absence of an added final vowel,
i.e., use of the form nə rather than n-a, tells the listener to expect more infor-
mation about what has gone before. While the grammatical system of the
language determines whether a given grammatical unit is grammatically com-
plete, the presence or absence of the phrase-final vowel determines whether
the hearer should expect more material in whatever grammatical construction
the speaker has chosen for conveying the information:(34) nambà gə́ və̃ ̀      ʒye ndə̀gandʒìkee …                syə́ɗáʔ har

that follows that morpheme is part of the same unit of the utterance, i.e., when
the material that follows can only be interpreted in the context of what has
gone before. In the next example, rùm (3M.POSS) has no added vowel because
the constituent that follows, namely fol-o ‘whitish’, cannot be interpreted in
the context of the material that follows. Adding a final vowel to rùm would
force the listener to view the form fol-o as the first component of the clause
that follows. The absence of a phrase-final vowel after fol would tell the lis-
tener to expect more information within the same constituent, but this would
be unfeasible since the next morpheme in the text is the preverbal (and usually
clause-initial) subject pronoun na:(36) mum láʔ i          wa rùm             fol-o           na laʔ   mbə́
     3M say COMP head 3M.POSS whitish-FV                   1SG COND come

     COND 1SG can 3M.O find ASSERT
     ‘He said his head is whitish; if I come, I can find him.’The form fol ‘whitish’ does not require a final vowel in order to be grammatical,
since the clause wa rùm fol can be used in isolation.
   In the following example, which also involves form rùm, the phrase-final
vowel -u indicates that the phrase that precedes it is complete and that what
follows is new material. Evidence for this is that the direct-speech phrase that
follows rùm-u can stand alone:(37) a. mum gwaʔətʃí və          rùm-u        syamɗyewũ              ɗyè

completeness is provided by the following example, where two noun phrases
have the same structure but the vowel can be added only after the speaker has
finished expressing the idea:(38) handày tsóɓ ya nãw ɗáw(-*a) kə     hu ɗáw-a
     3PL     buy cow one(-*FV) ASSC goat one-FV
     ‘they bought one cow and one goat’Further evidence that absence of the phrase-internal vowel is not determined
by pre-pausal position is that a form without the added vowel can, and often
does, occur before a pause:(39) mum gé də̀wã səlay ùm…          bruk         ne nùm-u

     ‘look here, you’d better get up!’Interestingly, the lack of a phrase-final vowel where such a vowel would be
expected, e.g. at the end of an utterance that is grammatically and semanti-
cally complete, places emphasis on the final element of the constituent. This is
illustrated by the following elicited exchange:Speaker 1:(42) Taú tá lúmò tám-á
     T. go market today-FV
     ‘Tau went to the market today’
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

5       ConclusionLexical and grammatical morphemes in Pévé show a formal alternation be-
tween the phrase-internal form, which is also the isolated form, and the phrase-
final form, which consists of the phrase-internal form with an added final
vowel. When a phrase-final constituent ends in a consonant in the isolated
form, the vowel added to the constituent in phrase-final position is a copy of
the vowel that precedes the final consonant. When the phrase-final constituent
ends in ə in the isolated form, the vowel ə is deleted in phrase-final position and
replaced by a, which may be the underlying form of the phrase-final vowel.
When the phrase-final constituent ends in a front or back vowel in the isolated
form, the underlying final vowel is retained and the phrase-final marker a can-
not be used. A morpheme that has no meaning or function unless it is followed
by additional material does not undergo phrase-final vowel addition.
   The contrast between the phrase-final form and the phrase-internal form
of a given morpheme tells the listener how to parse the utterance. When a
morpheme has an added final vowel, the morpheme is interpreted as the final
component of the constituent to which it belongs. The constituent does not
have to be grammatically complete, but it must contain all of the information
that the speaker intends to include in that constituent. When a morpheme is
in phrase-internal form, the listener expects more material within the same
constituent. If the next morpheme is also in phrase-internal form, the listener
expects still more material within the same constituent, and so on. While the
contrast between the phrase-final added vowel and the absence of an added
vowel in Pévé is not identical with the contrast between final vowel retention
and final vowel reduction/deletion in Wandala, both may be considered func-
tions within the domain of parsing morphology.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81]"
"
4       ConclusionPévé has grammaticalized the subjunctive mood, which subsumes the sub-
domains of the imperative and the subjunctive as often described for other
languages, and the epistemic mood, defined as the expression of the speaker’s
belief in the truth or likelihood of an event. The subjunctive mood is marked
by the absence of a subject pronoun or use of a subject pronoun from the sub-
junctive set. Apart from intonation and context, there is no dedicated means of
distinguishing a command to the second person from other functions within
the subjunctive mood. The subjunctive mood is subdivided into several deon-
tic modalities, including obligation, permission, and prohibition, all of which
are marked by clause-final particles in clauses that are marked subjunctive by
the choice of subject pronoun. Epistemic modality includes a number of sub-
domains, some of which are described in other chapters. Subdomains include
the speaker’s promise, marked by the clause-final particle ɓo, and the widely
used assertive mood, marked by the clause-final particle si, which conveys the
speaker’s desire that the hearer believe in the truth of a statement or in the
actuality of an event or state. Both markers occur only in the indicative mood.",[191]

5       Notes on the TranscriptionIn transcriptions of natural discourse data, the top line represents the author’s
auditory perception of the utterance of the native speaker, sometimes with
the help of the Praat program (www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/). The second line
shows the underlying form of each morpheme used in the utterance. In tran-
scriptions throughout the text there are some inconsistencies in the underlying
form, as it is not always clear which form is underlying and which represents a
variation. This is complicated by dialectal variations in the pronunciation of a
given form.
   The third line in a natural discourse example contains the gloss of the under-
lying meaning and/or function of each element of the utterance, in accordance
with the Leipzig glossing rules. The fourth line consists of a colloquial English
translation of the Pévé utterance. Here is an example of a natural discourse
transcription. The term ‘lit.’ refers to the literal or underlying meaning of a
form:

and occasionally the gloss, of a given example may differ slightly from one
occurrence to another, depending on the topic of the surrounding narrative
and the function(s) that the example has been chosen to demonstrate.
   Elicited examples consist of three lines: The underlying morphemes, as per-
ceived by speaker and listener; the gloss showing the meaning and/or function
of each morpheme; and the English translation of the utterance. The transla-
tion of an elicited example begins with a capital letter only if the first element
of the utterance is a proper name. An elicited example may end with a question
mark, an exclamation point, or zero punctuation:(2) à          mbə̀ riʔ-i

    ‘he saw me on the road’ (zero punctuation)In the top line (i.e. Pévé form) of the transcription, a slash between two mor-
phemes indicates that either morpheme, but not both, can be used in the same
utterance:(4) ma/swə                  wé nàn-a
    person (f.)/person (m.) see 1SG.O-FV

form has more than one pronunciation, as in tsóhoʔ ~ tswóhoʔ ‘eight’ and go ~
gwaʔ ‘then’. Partially or fully reduplicated forms are marked by a word-internal
hyphen, as in ryéŋ-ryéŋ(e) ‘very small, thin’ and tʃiriŋ-riŋ ‘very deep’.
   A parenthesized component in the Pévé form is considered by the native
speaker to be optional in the utterance in question:(6) May (wə́) ɗi fún

    ‘May cooks food’ (ɗi fún and wə́ ɗi fún have the same meaning)A parenthesized component in the English translation is intended for clarifi-
cation and does not directly correspond to any morpheme in the Pévé version,
e.g.:(7) na tsoɓ ʒyè           wũ ne ɓo
    1SG buy peanuts 2M.O ADP PROM
    ‘I (will) definitely buy you some peanuts’A bracketed morpheme or phrase in the top line or second line of a natural dis-
course example represents a self-correction made by the native speaker after
listening to a recording of his own text:(8) ɓay mùm tʃí vun rùmu           [syemɗe rùm …] (error) syemɗe

    ‘… and he (guinea fowl) asked him, “What is his name?” ’ (rùm: 3M inalien-
    able possessor; ùm: 3M alienable possessor; see chapter 5)As is the case in many languages, there is often free variation in the pronun-
ciation of certain phonemes, especially those that involve a stop or fricative
followed by a high or mid front vowel. This is particularly true with respect
to underlying vs. surface tone, since the latter may be affected by intonation
and stress patterns, which themselves may be affected by context, previous dis-
course, the speaker’s motivation, and other factors. The phonemic structure
and tone of examples throughout the text are transcribed as heard by the lis-
tener but do not always represent the underlying form from the native speaker’s
perspective. As a result, there may be inconsistencies in the transcription of
certain morphemes described in the text below. For clarity, the attached Pévé-

2       Future Tense2.1       Form of the Future Tense
The future tense is marked by the form də̀, probably derived from the verb də̀
‘to go’, followed by the main verb. The main verb carries its underlying tone,
i.e., the tone that occurs in the citation form, in the unmarked verb form, and
in all tenses and aspects other than the perfective (see sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4,
below):(1) Taú də̀ tà lúmò
    T. FUT walk market
    ‘Tau will walk to the market’(2) ɓà     ha də̀ we      sakə sà      sù
    ɓay ha də̀ we sa kə                sa su
    CONJ 2M FUT know who ASSC who Q
    ‘So how will you know who is who?’Evidence that the future marker də̀ in such constructions is a grammatical
marker and not the phonetically similar verb ‘to go’ is provided by the fact that
the future construction does not necessarily involve movement (see preceding
example). Moreover, the future marker may co-occur with the main verb də ‘to
go’, evidence that the two forms have different functions:(3) Taú də̀ də lúmò
    T. FUT go market
    ‘Tau will go to the market’As shown in chapter 6, an object pronoun from the non-perfective set can inter-
vene between the future marker and the main verb. This is evidence that the
future marker, like other tense/aspect markers, is a constituent that is separate
from the main verb:
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

    1SG NEG FUT sell          cow 1SG.POSS 3M.O ADP NEG
    ‘I will not sell him my cow’2.2     Function of the Future Tense
Evidence that the future marker də̀ codes the future tense is that it can be used
with an adverbial referring to a specific time in the future:(6) ta də̀ gewa Garoua síw
    3M FUT return G.          tomorrow
    ‘she will return from Garoua tomorrow’(7) dayna dùkrí mə̀ tám (pause) namba də̀ ke wə         Garoua
    after night REL today             1PL  FUT COP PREP G.
    ‘After tonight, we will be in Garoua.’The marker də̀ cannot be used in a clause that refers to the past or the time of
speech:(8) na *də̀ tsóɓ vú kúm-ú
    1SG FUT buy salt yesterday-FV
    *for ‘I bought salt yesterday’(9) á *də̀ tà rəʔ /riʔ/ go [gwa]

     ‘I can come on in now’Evidence that the future marker də̀ codes tense rather than aspect is that it can
be used in reference to a future bounded event, a future ongoing event, or a
future state, all of which are functions in the domain of aspect:(12) kəri məni kwáti làʔ      gí ndóʔ si,     nambà də̀ ti

     use ba)(14) ta də̀ kè bay màn-a
     3F FUT be friend 1SG.POSS-FV
     ‘she will be my friend’Further evidence that də̀ is a tense marker is that it can co-occur with a marker
of aspect, such as the imperfective marker wə́. The marking of both tense and
aspect in the same clause is unusual in Chadic languages. In the following
examples, the imperfective marker is not required, but its use is considered
grammatical:(15) ta láʔá nambà (wə́) də̀ Pala
     3F say 1PL       IMPF go P.
     ‘she said, “We will be going to Pala”’(16) handày (wə) də tsoɓ bàfyek man ne

3       AspectThe following aspectual distinctions are marked within the verb phrase: Perfec-
tive aspect, coded by high tone on the verb; imperfective aspect, coded by the
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

main verb; and the unmarked aspect, coded by use of the verb with underlying
tone and no other markers.
  An aspect marker, like the future marker, follows the subject noun or pro-
noun and precedes the verb. As illustrated in sections 3.2 and 3.3, other material
may intervene between the subject marker and the aspect marker or between
the aspect marker and the verb.","[155, 156, 157, 158]"
"3.3.1       Form
The progressive aspect is marked by the perfective form of the copula ké (some-
times with the surface form kə́) followed by the main verb (cf. chapter 11 for use
of ké as the copular main verb). The verb following ké is unmarked and carries
its underlying tone:(50) tá ké      gi tsoɓ mbìr kə       fə́tá
     3F PROG sell        milk ASSC dry season

     ‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope (lit. ‘river-mud’ (Ful.); a village where Pévé
     is spoken)’Reference to an ongoing event that may occur after the time of speech is indi-
cated by the imperfective marker wə́ before the future tense construction də +
Verb (see chapter 11):(52) námbà wə́      də suk fəta tam kə           bãrĩ mba
     1PL     IMPF FUT stay day today ASSC Bar today
     ‘We will be spending the day today with Bar.’3.3.2      Function
Evidence that the marker ké does not mark the past tense is that ké can be used
in a clause with an adverbial referring to the time of speech. The function of
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

the time of speech:(53) ta ni ké          ge ndoʔ sin sə́          na
     3F now PROG finish work 3F.POSS I.PRO
     ‘she is just now finishing her work’ (in answer to ‘what is she doing?’)(54) ta ké        dayri mgbaŋ ni na
     3F PROG arrive just now now I.PRO
     ‘she is just now arriving’ (in answer to ‘where is she right now?’)The progressive aspect differs from the perfective aspect in that a clause mark-
ed for progressive aspect may refer to an uncompleted or ongoing event prior
to the time of speech:(55) ta ké     ɗi     fún ɓay ta ké          gi tsoɓ rùm        lúmò
     3F PROG make food CONJ 3F PROG sell               3M.POSS market
     ‘she was making food and she was selling it at the market’Cf. the perfective aspect, which codes completion of the event before the time
of speech:(56) ta ɗí    fún ɓay ta gí tsoɓ rum lúmò
     3F make food CONJ 3F sell         3M.O market
     ‘she made food and sold it at the market’The progressive aspect differs from the imperfective aspect in that the latter
describes an event that is ongoing at the time of speech:(57) ta wə́     ɗi    fún ɓay ta wə́          də̀ gi tsoɓ rum      lúmò
     3F IMPF make food CONJ 3F IMPF go sell                3M.POSS market
     ‘she is making food (right now) and selling it at the market’In some cases the same event can be described using either the perfective
aspect or the progressive aspect, with a slight difference in meaning. In the
following examples, use of the perfective aspect indicates that the event, what-
ever its duration, is completed, while use of the progressive focuses on the
duration of the past event. This distinction is expressed in the English trans-
lations:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘I was going the day before yesterday’As is often the case with markers of aspect, the specific aspectual or temporal
function of ké may depend on surrounding discourse and/or knowledge shared
by the speaker and hearer. The following example may thus have several inter-
pretations:(62) Gwà ké        súk       wə     Mayo-Lope
     G. PROG stay, live PREP M.-L.
     ‘Gwa lived/was living/used to live in Mayo-Lope’ (in answer to a question
     or as a preface to a sequential clause)Use of additional markers outside of the domains of tense and aspect may be
used to narrow the meaning of the clause (English translations are approxi-
mate):(63) Gwà ké      súk        wə    Mayo-Lope si
     G. PROG stay, live PREP M.-L.          ASSERT
     ‘Gwa lived/was living in Mayo-Lope’                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     G. PROG live, stay PREP M.-L.          already-FV
     ‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope’In many cases the clause marked for progressive aspect provides information
necessary for the proper understanding of the clause that follows, as in the next
example:(65) ta ké       ɓáy kum           àmá tám ta tsú ɓáy zaʔ mi
     3F PROG pretty yesterday but today 3F NEG pretty still NEG
     ‘she used to be pretty, but she isn’t pretty anymore’ (note the use of kum
     ‘yesterday’ in broad reference to the past)The progressive aspect in Pévé can be used in an independent clause whose
proper interpretation depends on the clause that preceded it in conversation.
For example, the progressive may be used in a response to a content question,
whose inherent function is to seek more information about a given situation.
The clause marked for progressive aspect provides that information:(66) na ké        in      dàn kə       rù
     1SG PROG speak word ASSC 2M.POSS
     ‘I was talking to you’ (in answer to ‘what were you doing?’)3.4      Unmarked Aspect
3.4.1      Form
The unmarked aspect is characterized by underlying tone on the verb and the
absence of a non-verbal tense or aspect marker. The unmarked aspect is found
in both independent clauses and dependent clauses:(67) na wàʔ ʔyá (ye)
     1SG want leave PERM
     ‘I want to leave’(68) na tsú bə̀ ɬew də́ mi
     1SG NEG like meat dog NEG
     ‘I don’t like dog meat’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M ask 3M.POSS-FV name 3M.POSS call how Q
     ‘He asked him, “What do they call him?”’The unmarked aspect is the form used in subjunctive clauses, as marked by a
subject pronoun from the subjunctive set (see chapter 6):(70) à láʔá               fãmbə       tám-a
     ha láʔ á             faŋ mbə     tám-a
     2M say 1SG.SBJV repeat come today-FV
     ‘you said I should come here again today’(71) à          pum nùm ye
     2M.SBJV hit 3M.O PERM
     ‘hit him!’ or ‘you can hit him!’ (‘can’ is used here in the permissive sense)The imperfective aspect marker wə́ can be optional in a clause referring to an
unbounded event. Since the verb following the imperfective marker has its
underlying tone, deleting wə́ results in a clause in the unmarked tense/aspect,
raising the question of whether there really is an unmarked tense/aspect:(72) May (wə́) ɗi fún ɓay Gwà (wə́) gi tsoɓ rum              lúmò
     M. IMPF cook food CONJ G. IMPF sell             3M.POSS market
     ‘May cooks food and Gwa sells it at the market’The evidence that there is an unmarked aspectual form that is distinct from the
imperfective or any other aspect is provided by the fact that there are indica-
tive clauses in which neither the perfective high tone nor an overt tense/aspect
marker, including wə́, can be used. This is true of the subjunctive clause below:(73) mum *wə́/*də̀     gewa mbə̀ sədayʔ         dáyʔ
     3M IMPF/FUT return come day after tomorrow day after
     for ‘he should come back in three days’In the following example, the verb ɗə is not marked for tense or aspect and can
occur only in its underlying form. Reference to the future is provided solely by
the temporal adverbial siw:(74) à          ɗə/*ɗə́ nan siw-i
     2M.SBJV call       1SG.O tomorrow-FV
     ‘call me tomorrow’                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
tense and aspect                                                               153  Similarly with the verb mbə̀ ‘come’, which retains its underlying low tone
even in reference to the future:(75) Taú láʔ mum mbə̀ siw-i
     T. say 3M come tomorrow-FV
     ‘Tau said he will come tomorrow’In the main clause of the following example neither wə́ (IMPF) or də̀ (FUT)
can be used before the verb ‘to say’. The use of the non-perfective pronoun ùm
to indicate the addressee rules out the perfective interpretation, leaving the
unmarked aspect as the only possible meaning:(76) lum gwàʔ *wə́/*də̀       ùm in ne na      à   kar riʔ
     lion then IMPF/FUT 3M.O say ADP I.PRO 2M.SBJV look already
     mbə̀ tí          rìʔi
     come PROX.F already
     for ‘Lion then says to him, “Look here!”’Compare with the perfective form, where the addressee is marked by nùm, not
ùm, and the adposition ne precedes the addressee. The future marker is omit-
ted in the complement clause, leaving only the choice of pronoun (màn, the
non-perfective 1SG object) and the constituent order SOV as markers of the
non-perfective aspect:(77) mum lɛ́ʔ né nəm ha lambə                   sí       ha man yè
     mum láʔ ne nùm ha láʔ              mbə̀ si          ha màn yè

     si
     si
     ASSERT
     ‘He told him, “If you come here, you will know me.” ’3.4.2       Function
The interpretation of the unmarked aspect depends on context. When there
is no adverbial or other marker indicating the temporal structure of the event,
the unmarked aspect may be interpreted as pertaining to the time of speech,
as is the case with the form waʔ ‘want’ in the following:
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     REL           last time pass I.PRO
     ‘I want to tell the story about my most recent trip from Maroua to Garoua
     last Friday.’The unmarked aspect may also indicate a habitual or unbounded event. Use of
a temporal adverbial may narrow the scope of the unmarked aspect:(79) tá gi tsoɓ súm ( fə̀tà lúmò)
     3F sell      beer day market
     ‘she sells beer (on the day of the market)’The unmarked aspect may describe an unbounded state that obtains at the
time of speech:(80) Gwà toŋ pã          May si
     G. large exceed M. ASSERT
     ‘Gwa is bigger than May’The unmarked aspect may also describe an unbounded state that obtained
prior to the time of speech:(81) motaʔ         ɗáw tsugàk          tsùwal mi

     car (Ful.)    one NEG can cross NEG
     ‘Not one car could cross it.’ (before the time of speech)The constituent order in the unmarked tense/aspect is the same as that of a
clause in any other non-perfective aspect (see chapter 6). In the next example,
the order S V O IO ne, along with the choice of pronoun from the non-perfective
set, makes it clear that the clause is non-perfective, even though there is no
overt tense/aspect marker:
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

marker də̀; the perfective aspect, marked by relative high tone on the verb;
the imperfective aspect, marked by the preverbal marker wə́; the progressive
aspect, marked by the preverbal marker ké; and the unmarked aspect, charac-
terized by underlying tone on the verb and the absence of any other external
markers. Only the unmarked aspect is attested in the subjunctive clause.
   The perfective aspect describes a singulative event that was or will be com-
pleted, while the imperfective describes a state or event ongoing at the time of
speech or some other specified time. The progressive aspect marks a clause as
essential to understanding the material that follows the marked clause or as a
response to a preceding question. The interpretation of the unmarked aspect
depends on context and the nature of the event. In the indicative clause, the
unmarked aspect may refer to ongoing, repeated, habitual or unbounded event;
in the subjunctive clause, the unmarked aspect may also refer to a bounded or
singulative event.","[164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"

2        Conditional ConstructionsThe conditional construction in Pévé, as in many languages, describes a certain
state or event (protasis) and the potential outcome or implications of the state
or event (apodosis). The conditional protasis clause, which describes the ini-
tial state or event, is marked by the conditional marker làʔ and by use of the
assertive marker si in clause-final position. The marker làʔ, no doubt derived
from the verb làʔ ‘to say’, may occur immediately before or after the subject of
the protasis, with no apparent distinction. Tense and aspect are marked in the
conditional protasis and apodosis by the same means used in the independent
clause:(1) làʔ      hə́ŋ gí    kwáti ndóʔ si           nambà də̀ ti

marker at the end of the protasis clause advises the hearer to believe that the
event or state described in the protasis has occurred, will occur, or may occur.
The use of the assertive marker in the conditional clause is explained by the fact
that consequences expressed in the apodosis will have no bearing if the hearer
does not believe in the truth or reality of the protasis. The consequences of the
protasis are described in the apodosis clause, which has the same form as the
corresponding simple sentence:(5) laʔ        tsoɓ rum         ɓáyrúm si,      i     tsoɓ gaʔ ri məsin

    ‘if you have finished cooking, we will eat’Cf. the simple sentence:(8) nambà də̀ ti
    1PL      FUT eat
    ‘we will eat’As shown in the preceding examples, there is no dedicated marker of the condi-
tional apodosis. There are, however, two types of conditional apodosis clauses:
One that is followed by the assertive marker si and one that is not followed by
the assertive marker. Both are described below.
   When the apodosis involves the auxiliary verb gàk ‘can, be able to’ followed
by another verb, the apodosis is followed by the marker si:(9) na làʔ        mbə́ síi          na gàʔ əm zaʔ si
    na làʔ        mbə́ si           na gàk ùm zàʔ si
    1SG COND come ASSERT 1SG can 3M.O find ASSERT
    ‘If I came here, I could find him.’(10) mum làʔ         gé ndoʔ sin um             si        mum gàk pemãy
     3M COND finish work 3M.POSS ASSERT 3M can rest
     si
     ASSERT
     ‘if he has finished his work, he can rest’ [gé ndoʔ ‘throw end’]The marker si may also follow the apodosis when the protasis describes a
state or event that did not occur. In the next example, evidence that the event
described by the protasis did not occur is provided by use of the counterfactual
(CF) marker kə̀zə́ (see chapter 19) in the protasis clause. This provides evidence
that the assertive marker indicates the speaker’s desire that the hearer accept
an ‘if X, then Y’ connection between the protasis and the apodosis rather than
the speaker’s belief in the real-world state or event:(11) mum làʔ        gbə̀gbóŋ kə̀zə́ ɓáyrúm sí,        kà mum kóra sìnè
     3M COND strong CF much ASSERT then 3M leave field

     DED.M finish arrive ASSERT
     ‘if he were very strong, he would have finished the field earlier’                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

The explanation for this is that use of the future tense indicates the speaker’s
belief that an event or state will occur, so use of the assertive marker would
result in reduplication:(12) handày làʔ        wə́   gí sin wándʒì sí                 handày də̀ ndóʔ
     3PL       COND IMPF do work together ASSERT 3PL                     FUT finish
     ʃìnè rúm         gáʔrí *si
     field 3M.POSS quickly ASSERT
     ‘if they are working together, they will finish their field faster’For the same reason si cannot follow the independent future clause:(13) mum də̀ gewa Garoua síw               *si
     3M FUT return G.             tomorrow *ASSERT
     for ‘he will return from Garoua tomorrow’The assertive marker also does not occur when the apodosis is marked for
another modality, such as obligation or permission. The fact that the assertive
marker does not co-occur with other modality markers adds to the evidence
that si itself is a marker of modality, since markers of different modalities can-
not occur in the same clause. The marker si does not occur when the apodosis
is marked with the clause-initial obligation marker sáy. The following sentence
expresses the speaker’s doubt in the subject’s arrival:(14) mum làʔ         də̀ mbə̀ kətáʔ si sáyʔ na gíláʔ tú
     3M COND FUT come now REL OBLIG 1SG ready body
     rìn-ì           *si
     1SG.POSS-FV ASSERT
     ‘if he comes, I must be ready’The marker si also does not occur when the apodosis clause is marked for the
subjunctive mood, as indicated by use of the subjunctive (SBJV) pronoun (see
chapter 9):(15) la?      hí wə́      də̀ lumo si,           i      dʒi wa
     COND 2PL IMPF go market ASSERT 2PL.SBJV wait head

conditional and temporal constructions                                            263   The key components of the conditional construction are thus the con-
ditional marker làʔ preceding or following the subject of the protasis, the
assertive marker si at the end of the protasis, and the stand-alone nature of
the apodosis.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279]"

6       Outline of the Grammar6.1       Phonology
The phonology of Pévé resembles that of many other Chadic languages in hav-
ing a rich consonant system. In Pévé, the system includes glottalized and labi-
alized stops, palatalized and non-palatalized fricatives, lateral fricatives, glottal
stops, a number of continuants, and syllable-initial consonant clusters. Pévé
has the phonemic vowels /i, e, a, o, u, ə/, where ə represents a high-central
vowel. The nasalized vowels /ĩ, ẽ, ã, õ, and ũ/ also occur in surface forms. The
question of the phonemic vs. phonetic nature of nasalized vowels is discussed
in chapter 2.
    Syllables in Pévé may have the form V, CV, VC, CVC, CCV, CCVC, CCCVC.
An interesting feature of Pévé is that the majority of lexical items in the data
are monosyllabic. Among the few polysyllabic lexical items in the data, most
are obviously derived through compounding or other morphological means
(see below), suggesting that the derivation of the polysyllabic forms is relatively
recent.
    Pévé has three tones, high, mid, and low, which carry functions in the do-
mains of both lexicon and grammar. In some cases a lexical distinction is coded
solely by tone. The primary function of tone in the grammatical system is the
coding of perfective aspect by means of relative high tone on the verb. In all
tenses and aspects other than the perfective, the verb has its underlying tone,
i.e., the tone that is used in the isolated or citation form. In the description
below, this form is referred to as the unmarked or non-perfective form of the
verb. As shown in chapters 8–10, temporal, aspectual and modal categories
other than the perfective are coded by preverbal markers and by the choice of
subject and non-subject pronouns. The use of non-subject pronouns to mark
functions that are typically associated with verbal markers is an unusual char-
acteristic of the Pévé language.",[28]
"2.6     Mood in the Complement Clause
The subjunctive mood in the complement is coded by the use of a subject pro-
noun from the subjunctive set. This holds true for direct- and indirect-speech
complements:(51) mə̀m láʔá            fãmbə tám kədàn vɛ            səle   màn-a
     mum láʔ á            faŋ mbə̀ tám kə́dàn ve        sə̀lay màn-a
     3M say 1SG.SBJV return today PURP collect money 1SG.POSS
     ‘He said I should come back today to collect my money.’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     lion say 2M.SBJV 2M.SBJV repeat PERM
     ‘Lion said, “Go back!”’The subjunctive subject marker is used even if the nature of the matrix clause
indicates obligation or command, as in the following example:(53) tá ták nùm í            nə̀       tsòɓ mbə̀ràw né sə́ mì
     3F forbid 3M.O COMP 3M.SBJV buy clothing ADP 3F.O NEG
     ‘she forbade him from buying her clothing’The subject is marked in the subjunctive complement even if the subject is also
overtly marked as the addressee in the main clause:(54) handày ín ne mbà mə́                  ʔyá só  sí
     3PL      say ADP 1PL.O 1PL.SBJV leave village ASSERT
     ‘they told us we should leave the village’(55) ə̀ŋ        làʔ sə́ tə̀         mbə̀ ye
     2F.SBJV say 3F.O 3F.SBJV come PERM
     ‘tell her to come!’ (‘(you) tell her1 she1 should come’)2.7     Speech Topic as Complement
The complement of a verb of saying may represent the thing said or the topic
of speech. The noun dàn ‘word’ after the verb in refers to a fragment of speech,
which may or may not be specific:(56) na ín dàn ne nù
     1SG tell word ADP 2M.O
     ‘I told you something/I told you that’(57) na ké        in dàn kə        rù
     1SG PROG tell word ASSC 2M.POSS
     ‘I was saying something/that to you’The phrase wa dàn ‘about’ (lit. ‘on word’) marks what follows as the topic of
speech:
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     1SG want PURP tell         about trip
     ‘I would like to talk about the trip.’The form wa, corresponding to ‘about’, may occur without the noun dàn ‘word’
without an apparent change in meaning:(59) swə mə̀ní ha ín       dan wa sa              nə mbə́ sí
     man REL 2M speak word about 3F.POSS DED.M come ASSERT

     ‘he asked me about the animal that we saw’Attempts to elicit a nominalized verb as a complement of a verb of saying pro-
duced only complements in the form of independent clauses, preceded by the
complementizer i:(61) handày ín né nàn í                  á         ʔyá yé
     3PL      say ADP 1SG.O COMP 1SG.SBJV leave PERM
     ‘they told me to leave’ (‘they told me I should leave’)(62) tá ták     nùm í          nə̀       tsòɓ mbə̀ràw né sə́ mì
     3F forbid 3M.O COMP 3M.SBJV buy clothing ADP 3F.O NEG
     ‘she told him not to buy her clothing’ (‘she told him that he (should) not
     buy clothing for her’)
3       Verbs of PerceptionComplements of matrix verbs of perception distinguish between direct and
indirect perception. The recorded verbs of perception include mùn ‘to hear, to
understand’, we ‘to see, to know, to recognize’, and ye, a dialectal variant of we.
   Indirect perception is coded by the complementizer i followed by an inde-
pendent clause. Since there is no addressee, the complementizer i follows the
matrix-clause verb:
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘Tau heard that she1,2 forgot her1,2 hoes’The complementizer i may be preceded by the phrase handày ín ‘they said’,
where the 3PL subject pronoun represents an unspecified speaker:(65) Taú mún handày ín i              tá ɗúm wa kávà s-á
     T. hear 3PL         say COMP 3F forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
     ‘Tau heard that she1 forgot her1 hoe’ (‘Tau heard them/someone say that
     she forgot her hoe’)Direct perception is coded by the object role of the complement clause in the
matrix clause, the same means used to code the de re domain with the verb tʃi
vun ‘to ask’. The complementizer i does not occur:(66) na wé swə wə́        mbə̀ hayʔ mbà
     1SG saw man IMPF enter PREP 1PL.POSS
     ‘I saw someone entering our place’Evidence that the complement is the object of the matrix clause is provided by
the fact that the pronominal subject of the complement clause is represented
by an object pronoun:(67) na wé sə́ ʔyá       wə́  dà
     1SG see 3F.O depart IMPF go
     ‘I saw her leaving’The subject of the complement clause may be represented as the possessor of
the thing heard:(68) na mún syem tà ùm                wə́     mbà
     1SG hear foot walk 3M.POSS IMPF come
     ‘I heard him coming’ (‘I heard his feet walking’)
                                                                 Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     M. heard word 1SG.POSS ASSERT
     ‘May heard/understood what I said’ (‘heard my words’)
4       Verbs of CognitionVerbs of cognition include we or ye ‘to recognize, to know’ (also ‘to see’, above),
ɗìk ‘to think, to believe’, and ɗúm wa ‘to forget’ (‘to lose head’). Complements of
these verbs code a distinction between indirect knowledge and direct knowl-
edge. The latter is marked by the complement serving as the object of the
matrix clause.
   The complement representing indirect knowledge is an independent clause
preceded by the complementizer i:(70) mum wə́        ɗìk      i        mum gáo
     3M IMPF believe COMP 3M hunter
     ‘he1 believes that he1,2 is a hunter’(71) mum ɗík        i         mum gáo
     3M believe COMP 3M hunter
     ‘he1 believed that he1,2 was a hunter’In constructions involving the verb we as a cognitive verb, the matrix clause
is followed by the assertive marker sí, possibly to distinguish we as a cognitive
verb from we as a verb of perception:(72) na wé      si        hə́ŋ ɗúm wa kávà màŋ-á
     1SG know ASSERT 2F forget hoe 2F.POSS-FV

     ‘I know that you (PL) forgot your hoes’Cf. we as a verb of perception, as indicated by the absence of si:(74) na wé i            tá ɗúm wa kávà s-á

domain de re, indicated by the fact that the nominalized verb of the comple-
ment functions as the object of the main clause:(75) swə̀ nyé           ʒi gayʔ      si
     swə nə       yé    ʒi gayʔ      si
     man DED.M know play game-FV ASSERT
     ‘the man knew how to play gayʔ’In the next example the compound verb ɮaʔ wa dàn (ɮáʔ+‘about’) corresponds
to ‘to realize’. It is possible that ɮaʔ and zaʔ ‘to find’ are derived from the same
source. In the next example, the event of the de re complement is represented
by a nominalized compound verb (ɗúm wa) that functions as the object of
the main clause. The agent of the complement clause, which may have its
own object, is indicated by a possessive pronoun modifying the nominalized
verb:(76) sə̀ráy ɮáʔ     wa dàn ɗúm wa kávà s-á
     S.     realize about forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
     ‘Səray realized that she forgot her hoe’ (‘she realized the forgetting of her
     hoe’)The complement of the compound verb ɗúm wa is marked for the domain de
re when the thing forgotten is an entity or place. The complement is a relative
clause whose head (bolded) is the item whose identity is in question. The rela-
tive clause functions as the object of the matrix clause:(77) mum ɗúm wa ri          mə̀ ni mum wé kwá mə̀ tà kə́

5       Volitional Verb wàʔComplements of the verb wàʔ ‘to want’ distinguish between the domains
de dicto and de re, where the different-subject complement belongs to the
domain de dicto and the same-subject complement belongs to the domain de
re.
    The different-subject complement is an independent clause preceded by the
complementizer i. The use of a subject pronoun, not an object pronoun, to code
the subject of the complement is evidence that the subject of the complement
does not play a grammatical role in the main clause:(80) tá wə́    wàʔ i         handày ʔyá yé
     3F IMPF want COMP 3PL.O leave PERM
     ‘she wants them to leave’(81) handày wàʔ i            nambà ʔyá yé
     3PL     want COMP 1PL.O leave PERM
     ‘they want us to leave’An interesting feature of different-subject complements of the verb wàʔ is that
the 1PL or 3PL subject of the complement clause is marked by a pronoun from
the indicative/alienable possession set (see above), while all other subject pro-
nouns used in different-subject complements are from the subjunctive set. The
complementizer i occurs with both types of complements, indicative and sub-
junctive:(82) ha wàʔ i         á         gi mi su
     2M want COMP 1SG.SBJV do what Q

     1PL    want COMP 2PL.SBJV leave
     ‘we want you to leave’The distribution of indicative vs. subjunctive pronouns in the complement
holds true in all aspects and also with the counterfactual marker kə̀zə́:Subjunctive subject:(85) nambà wàʔ í           à  ʔyá

     3PL     want CF COMP 1PL        leave PERM
     ‘they wanted us to leave’The same-subject complement of the verb wàʔ has no subject marker. The verb
of the complement functions as the object of the matrix clause, marking the
clause as belonging to the domain de re. The complement may be followed by
the permission marker ye, which codes the subjunctive mood:(88) tá wàʔ ʔyá (ye)
     3F want leave PERM

     ‘they want to leave’The matrix verb wàʔ may be followed by the purpose marker kə́dàn, which also
codes purpose in non-volitional constructions. The only recorded instances
involve a same-subject complement without an overt subject marker, where
the subject of the complement is the object of the matrix clause:

6       Ability Verb gàk ‘Can, Be Able’The speaker’s estimation of the ability of the subject to perform an action is
coded by the verb gàk ‘to be able’ followed by a verb denoting the action. The
same form with the same meaning is found in Mundang. The verb gàk resem-
bles the future tense marker də̀ and the aspect marker wə́ and ké in that gàk
follows the subject and precedes the verb; the verb following gàk is in the
unmarked form; and other markers, including pronouns referring to the indi-
rect object, may intervene between gàk and the main verb. The verb gàk thus
functions as an auxiliary rather than a matrix verb:(92) mum làʔ         gé ndoʔ sin um             si mum gàk pemãy
     3M COND finish work 3M.POSS ASSERT 3M can rest
     si
     ASSERT
     ‘if he has finished his work, he can rest’When the verbal complement describing the action to be performed has a
pronominal direct object, the order of elements is S gàk O V and the pronoun
representing the object is from the non-perfective set:(93) na làʔ        mbə́ síi          na gàʔ əm zaʔ si

     3F FUT 3M.O hit-FV
     ‘she will hit him’High tone on the verb gàk in the indicative clause indicates that the poten-
tial action was achieved. The verb following gák (gàk with high tone) is in the
unmarked form and the object pronoun is from the perfective set:(95) na gák zaʔ nùm si
     1SG can find 3M.O ASSERT
     ‘I was able to find him’Although the construction involving gàk resembles constructions involving
tense and aspect markers, there are several important differences. One is the
fact that the verb gàk may carry the high tone coding perfective aspect, while
tense/aspect markers have fixed tone. Another is that gàk may function as a
main verb, as evidenced by the following complete clause:(96) na tsú gák mì
     1SG NEG can NEG
     ‘I was not able to/I could not’The speaker’s estimation of the subject’s ability can also be coded by a serial

marker kə̀zə́, glossed ‘CF’ for ‘counterfactual’, as a means of indicating that
the subject’s belief or wish, as expressed in the matrix clause, was unreal-
ized.
   The precise function of kə̀zə́ depends on the choice of verb in the matrix
clause. With a verb of cognition, kə̀zə́ indicates that the belief of the matrix-
clause subject did not turn out to be true. The marker kə̀zə́ follows the matrix
verb. The evidence that kə̀zə́ is part of the matrix clause and not the comple-
ment is that kə̀zə́ can be followed by the complementizer i.(98) sə̀ráy ɗík      kə̀zə́ i      tá ɗúm wa kávà s-á

     ‘S. thought that she forgot her hoe’ (she didn’t forget it)Cf. the clause with the compound verb ɮáʔ wa dàn ‘realize’, where the subject’s
belief is borne out by events. Here, kə̀zə́ does not occur:(99) sə̀ráy ɮáʔ wa dàn ɗúm wa kávà s-á
     S.      realize     forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
     ‘S. realized that she forgot her hoe’When it is not obvious whether the subject’s belief holds true or not, kə̀zə́ is not
used:(100) mum ɗík         i        mum gáo

      ‘he1 believed that he (1,2) was a hunter’ (he may or may not be a hunter)Use of kə̀zə́ with the volitional matrix verb wàʔ ‘want’ indicates that the sub-

      3PL     want leave PERM
      ‘they want to leave’In a sentence involving the auxiliary verb gàk ‘to be able’ there is no matrix
clause. The marker kə̀zə́, which indicates that the act the speaker deemed pos-
sible did not occur, is attested in both clause-final and clause-initial position, a
characteristic of most adjuncts (see chapter 23):(105) na gàk ùm zàʔ kə̀zə́ si

      CF 1SG can 3M.O find ASSERT

tual matrix clause can be followed by a clause negating the potential event
described by the matrix clause:(107) na gàk ùm zàʔ kə̀zə́ si              àmá na tsú gák mì

not met.","[296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"
"2.2.1      Addressee’s Obligation: riʔ

conveys a suggestion or a granting of permission (recall that i is the more formal
version of the 2M subjunctive pronoun):(26) i        mbə̀ ye
     2M.SBJV come PERM
     ‘come on over!’ or ‘you may come over’Use of the particle riʔ is not limited to the subjunctive mood. When used in
the indicative mood, the particle riʔ marks an event as having been completed
in the unspecified past. The evidence that riʔ is not an aspectual marker is
that it can be used with other markers of aspect. In the next example, where
high tone on the verb marks the perfective aspect, the particle riʔ is neces-
sary to show that the event of the first clause was completed prior to the
event of the second clause. The assertive marker si (see section 3.2, below) is
optional:(27) mum ndé ʃyèn (si)              riʔ     ɓay mum ti kwá ɓo
     3M fall sleep ASSERT already CONJ 3M eat thing PROM
     ‘he slept first (‘already’), and then he ate’In the next example, which is marked for progressive aspect, riʔ indicates that
the event was completed at some point in the past:(28) Gwà ké      suk wə       Mayo-Lope riʔ-i
     G. PROG stay PREP M.-L.            already-FV
     ‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope’The use of the particle riʔ in both indicative clauses and commands addressed
to the second person resembles functions of the adverb ‘already’ in English,
as in the indicative ‘he left already’ and the imperative ‘leave already!’ Similar
functions are posited for French déjà and Italian già in Hansen and Strudsholm
2008.","[179, 180]"

guish between a command (typically ascribed to the imperative mood) and a
wish, suggestion, possibility, etc. (typically ascribed to the subjunctive mood).
Although some clause-final particles imply obligation or urgency (see section
2), there is no dedicated particle that codes the imperative mood. The evidence
for this is that all of the particles that occur in commands addressed to the sec-
ond person also occur with subjects other than the second person, which are
by definition non-imperative.","[174, 175, 176, 177]"

alveolar affricate /dʒ/:/dz/    dzàk ‘to chop, cut into pieces’, dzòk ‘to pound grain using a mortar and
        pestle’, dzúk ‘to despise’The palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ is considered underlying because it may be
followed by a non-front, non-high vowel:/dʒ/    dʒí ‘to tend, to watch over’; dʒek (a small melon with white flesh); dʒwə̀
        ‘chief’In some cases there is free variation between the non-palatalized and palatal-
ized forms, as in dzìku vs. dʒìku ‘very (much)’. Before a mid front vowel, an
additional palatal glide may be inserted between the palato-alveolar affricate
and the vowel, as in dʒyew ‘tent, shelter’, dʒyèw ‘to tie something’.
   The voiced prenasalized affricate /ndz/ contrasts with /dz/:/ndz/ ndzar ‘sister’, ndzə̀r ‘brother’, ndzur ‘cousin’; ndzor (a wild vine-like
      plant)The voiced prenasalized affricate is palatalized before a high front vowel, as in
ndʒike ‘iron’, and optionally palatalized before a high back vowel, as in ndzuku
~ ndʒuku (a type of mouse).
   In some instances a labialized affricate appears to contrast with the non-
labialized affricate, e.g. tswə ‘to chew something crunchy’ vs. tsú (negative
marker); dʒwə ‘chief’ vs. dzùk ‘to despise’. It is likely that the labial feature is
a result of an underlying round vowel following the affricate. This hypothesis
is supported by the forms ndzú ‘to chew something crunchy’ in Lamé (Sach-
nine 1982: 437) and Dari (Wambadang p.c.) and the Lamé form dùwà ‘religious
leader’ (Sachnine 1982: 355). Moreover, since there appear to be no contrastive

morphemes. For morphemes for which there is no English equivalent, the English def-
inition consists of a description of the grammatical category or grammatical function.
The abbreviations used in the grammar and in the Pévé-English lexicon are also used
below.","[348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360]"
"3.1      Perfective Aspect
3.1.1      Form
The perfective aspect is marked by relative high tone on the verb, regardless of
the underlying (also called ‘unmarked’) tone of the verb. The tone on the per-
fective verb is higher than the tone of the syllable that precedes the verb (for
more detailed discussion of the nature of tone, see chapter 2):(17) na tí ɬew nãw kúm-ú
     1SG eat meat bovine yesterday-FV
     ‘I ate beef yesterday’ (unmarked form ti ‘to eat’)(18) mum tá lúmò kə          s-á
     3M go market ASSC 3F.O-FV
     ‘he went to the market with her’ (unmarked form tà ‘to walk’)When the verb has underlying high tone, there is no formal distinction between
the perfective aspect and the unmarked aspect:(19) mum súk             kə     mbà zə̀ bə̀kà tʃep-e
     3M stay, live, sit ASSC 1PL.O PREP day few-FV
     ‘he stayed with us for a few days’Cf. the unmarked aspect:(20) Taú súk            ka    su
     T. stay, live, sit where Q
     ‘where does Tau live?’If the verb is bisyllabic, only the first syllable carries high tone in the perfec-
tive:
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M return G.         CONJ 3M leave road M.           ASSERT
     ‘he returned from Garoua and he departed for Maroua’If the verb is a compound verb consisting of a verb followed by a noun, the
high tone coding the perfective is carried only by the verbal constituent of the
compound. The nominal constituent of the compound has its underlying tone:(22) na ín dàn               ne nù
     1SG say (‘speak word’) ADP 2M.O
     ‘I said something for you’ (unmarked forms are in ‘speak’ and dàn ‘word’)Cf. the following, where dàn functions as the verb and so carries the high tone
that marks the perfective:(23) na dán ne nù
     1SG word ADP 2M.O
     ‘I told you so’ (lit. ‘I gave you word’)In a serial verb construction of the form Verb+Verb, each verb carries high tone
in the perfective:(24) kəri məni handày fáŋ tá    dáy Garoua
     when      3PL    repeat go arrive G.
     ‘When they got back to Garoua …’Evidence that relative high tone on the verb is a coding means is that a verb
whose underlying form has low or mid tone cannot carry high tone in a clause
involving a marker of another tense or aspect, such as the future tense marker
də̀ or the imperfective aspect marker wə́:(25) mum də̀ gewa/*géwa Garoua síw
     3M FUT return            G.      tomorrow
     ‘he will return from Garoua tomorrow’(26) mum wə́       gewa/*géwa Garoua
     3M IMPF return            G.
     ‘he is returning from Garoua’

The perfective aspect, marked by high tone on the verb, is used to describe
a bounded event or state. The event or state may have been completed or
come to an end prior to the time of speech, or it may be expected to be com-
pleted or ended after the time of speech. The evidence that high tone on the
verb codes perfective aspect rather than the past tense is that the verb with
high tone can be used with reference to past, present, or future time (see
below).
    The perfective aspect may be used with reference to a single event that was
completed before the time of speech:(27) nambà ʔý       ti … kə         ndʒikèɬ (error) əə ndʒìke váɬ mə
     nambà ʔyá ti            kə     ndʒìke ɬ        əə ndʒìke váɬ mə

     tobacco 1SG.POSS day before yesterday-FV
     ‘He said, “One of you took my tobacco on credit (lit. ‘my tobacco’s credit’)
     the day before yesterday.”’The evidence that high tone on the verb marks the perfective aspect rather than
the past tense is that a verb marked for perfective aspect may refer to a bounded
event that will occur in the future. In this case, the verb is preceded by the con-
ditional marker làʔ (see chapter 18) and followed by si, the marker of assertive
modality (see chapter 9):(29) kwáti làʔ      gí ndóʔ sì             nambà də̀ ti

event or the state is bounded:(32) na tá Mora syem            ráw si

with an adverbial referring to the time of speech:(35) ta dáyri mgbaŋ ni na
     3F arrive just now now I.PRO
     ‘she arrived just now’The perfective aspect may be used with an adverbial coding the duration of the

3.2.1       Form
The imperfective aspect is marked by the aspectual marker wə́ in the position
after the subject and before the verb. The verb carries its underlying tone:(37) na wə́      dʒì (wa) Gwà
     1SG IMPF wait PREP G.
     ‘I’m waiting for Gwa’(38) mum wə́       tsoɓ ya nãw ɗáw-à

     ‘we are doing a reunion’Compare the perfective form, without wə́:(40) namba ɓáwá si
     1PL     reunite ASSERT
     ‘we reunited’Other material, such as the negative marker tsú, may intervene between the
subject and the imperfective aspect marker:(41) Sə́ráy tsú wə́        gí    sìn ɓáy dày Táo mì
     S.       NEG IMPF make work good arrive T NEG
     ‘Sə́ ráy works less hard than Tau’The indirect object pronoun may intervene between the imperfective aspect
marker and the verb:(42) mum wə́        mbà ne hu

     ‘he is giving us a goat’
                                                                Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

The imperfective aspect is used to describe an event that is ongoing at the time
of speech:(43) ya      vay wə́       ne kwáti kə vay

     ‘the mother is feeding her child’(44) səmbeɗ wə       səsaʔ-a

     ‘the wind is blowing’The imperfective aspect is also used to describe a current state:(45) vay wə́        tuk kəɗam-à
     child IMPF feel good-FV
     ‘the child is satisfied’ (lit. ‘the child feels good’)Evidence for the function of the imperfective marker is that it can co-occur
with an adverbial corresponding to ‘(right) now’:(46) na wə́      taʔ kwá sə́ ne go/gwa
     1SG IMPF show thing 3F.O ADP now
     ‘I am teaching her now’The evidence that wə́ codes the imperfective aspect rather than the present
tense is that the imperfective aspect can be used to describe an event that was
ongoing at a time prior to the time of speech. Note the contrast between the
perfective aspect, used to describe the completed event of the first clause, and
the imperfective, used to describe the ongoing event of the second clause:(47) mum mbə́ záʔ mbà ka           nambà wə́  gi ʃin-i
     3M came find 1PL.O while 1PL        IMPF do work-FV
     ‘he found us while we were working’Further evidence that wə́ does not code present tense is that it can be used with
an adverbial connoting a habitual event that may or may not be happening at
the time of speech:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘on market day, she sells beer’3.3      Progressive Aspect
The progressive aspect refers to an event or state that was ongoing before the

2        Conjunction ɓayThe conjunction ɓay conjoins two clauses that are part of the same narrative.
While the source of the conjunction ɓay is not obvious, the form is clearly not
a borrowing from Fulfulde or Mundang. Unlike coordinating conjunctions in
some languages, ɓay does not function as a nominal conjunction. In all but one
natural discourse example clauses conjoined by ɓay are independent clauses
and each clause has its own subject noun or pronoun. The subject of the second
clause is omitted in one natural discourse example and also in some elicited
examples.
   Clauses conjoined by ɓay often describe sequential events involving the
same participants:(1) mum ti kwá ɓay mum ndé ʃyen-e
    3M eat thing CONJ 3M fall sleep.N
    ‘he ate and then he slept’Prosodic evidence makes it clear that ɓay is a component of the second clause,
not the first clause, as there is frequently a drop in intonation and a pause
(marked by ‘…’) before the marker ɓay:

    ‘I lay down and I slept until five o’clock in the afternoon.’In the examples above, the conjoined clauses share a common subject. In dis-
course, the conjunction ɓay may introduce a sentence that shares nothing with
the preceding sentence other than the fact that both are part of the same nar-
rative. The discourse connector function of ɓay thus resembles the secondary
function of English markers such as ‘and’, ‘also’, ‘so’, ‘anyway’, ‘but’ (see Frajzyn-
gier and Katriel 1991). The discourse connector function of ɓay is illustrated in
the following pairs of consecutive sentences from natural texts:(3) a. nambà ʔyá ti … kə              ndʒikèɬ (error)         əə ndʒìke vaɬ

"2.1       Marking the Addressee
The means of marking the addressee of a verb of saying depends on two fac-
tors: (a) whether the addressee is represented by a noun or by a pronoun, and
(b) whether the verb is a simple verb or a compound verb consisting of a verb
followed by a noun.
    The pronominal addressee of a simple verb is marked in the same way as
an indirect object pronoun with the semantic role of beneficiary, recipient, or
malefactive (cf. chapter 7). As is the case in simple clauses involving an indirect
object, the choice of pronoun and the presence of the adposition ne depend on
the tense and aspect of the main clause. In a perfective clause with an inher-
ent verb of saying, the pronominal addressee is marked by an object from the
perfective set, preceded by the adposition ne:(1) na ín ne nù
    1SG say ADP 2M.O
    ‘I spoke to you’(2) ta ín ne nùm tə́              ʔyá yé
    3F say ADP 3M.O 3F.SBJV leave PERM
    ‘she1 told him she2 should leave’The nominal addressee, like the nominal indirect object in other types of pred-
ications (see chapters 6, 7), is marked by the associative preposition kə after the
adposition ne:(3) mum láʔ ne kə́         brùk             na      mum gewa mbə̀
    3M say ADP ASSC monitor lizard-FV I.PRO 3M come back
    sədayʔ
    two days later
    ‘He told Monitor Lizard he should come back in two days.’The addressee of a compound verb is marked differently from the addressee
of a simple verb. The verbs tʃí vun ‘to ask’ and ɗam vun ‘to answer’ are com-
pounds consisting of a verb followed by the noun vun ‘mouth’. The pronom-
                                                                         Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

pronoun rather than an object pronoun, probably because the nominal con-
stituent of some compound verbs is a body-part noun. The possessive pronoun
immediately follows the noun:(4) mum tsí vun rìn          i        na wé   vun Pévé sí sú?
    3M ask        1SG.POSS COMP 1SG know mouth P. ASSERT Q

    3M answer 3M.POSS-FV REL 1SG NEG NEG
    ‘He answered him, “It wasn’t mine!”’2.2      Coreferentiality vs. Non-coreferentiality
As shown in Frajzyngier 1996, some Chadic languages differentiate between
coreferentiality and non-coreferentiality (also called disjoint reference) with
respect to (a) the subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the comple-
ment clause, and (b) the addressee of the matrix clause and the subject of the
complement clause. Pévé has a grammatical means of indicating whether or
not the subject of the matrix clause is coreferential with the subject of the
complement clause. As shown below, this applies only when the complement
clause is in the subjunctive mood.
   When the pronominal subject of the matrix clause and the pronominal sub-
ject of the indicative complement clause have the same values for person, gen-
der, and number, the same pronoun form can be used to mark the subject in
both clauses. Coreferentiality or lack of coreferentiality with respect to the two
subject pronouns depends on context:(6) mum láʔ i             mum dʒwa
    3M said COMP 3M chief
    ‘he1 said that he1/2 is chief’(7) tá ín í            tá kəí kávà sá-a
    3M say COMP 3M break hoe 3F.POSS-FV
    ‘she1 said she1/2 broke her hoe’There is also no means of marking coreferentiality or non-coreferentiality
when the subject of the matrix clause is a noun and the subject of the indicative
complement is a pronoun:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

    K. say COMP 3M hunter I.PRO-FV
    ‘Koi said that he (Koi) is a hunter’ or ‘Koi said that he (someone else) is a
    hunter’While there is no overt means of coding coreferentiality of the two subjects
in the indicative mood, the subject of the complement clause can be omitted
when it shares the person, gender and number of the matrix clause subject.
When the subject of the complement clause is omitted, the assumption is that
the subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the complement clause refer
to the same entity:(9) mùm láʔ i           na    (mùm) táʔ tu        rùm né nàn
    3SG say COMP I.PRO 3M             show body 3M PREP 1SG.O
    si
    ASSERT
    ‘He1 said that (he1) would show himself to me.’When the complement clause is in the subjunctive mood, as defined in chap-
ter 9, Pévé does make a distinction between coreferentiality and non-corefer-
entiality between the pronominal subject of the matrix clause and the pronom-
inal subject of the complement. When the subject of the complement clause
shares the person, gender and number value of the subject of the matrix clause
but is not coreferential with the subject of the matrix clause, the subject of the
complement clause is marked by a subject pronoun from the subjunctive set
(see chapter 6):(10) ta ín ne nùm tə́             ʔyá yé
     3F say ADP 3M.O 3F.SBJV leave PERM
     ‘she1 told him she2 should/could leave’(11) mum ín ne nùm nə                 ʔyá yé
     3M say ADP 3M.O 3M.SBJV leave PERM
     ‘he1 told him he2 should/could leave’The subjunctive pronoun is also used when the subject of the matrix and the
subject of the complement do not share person, gender and number:(12) mùm láʔ á       fàŋ mbə̀ tám kə́dàn ve    sə̀lày
     3M say 1SG.SBJV return today PURP collect money
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

      1PL.POSS-FV
      ‘He said I should come back today to collect my money.’The evidence that the subjunctive pronoun in the complement marks non-
coreferentiality rather than the subjunctive nature of the complement is that
when the subject of the subjunctive complement clause is coreferential with
the subject of the matrix clause, the same pronoun form is used in both clauses.
In other words, when the subject of the matrix clause and the subject of the
complement clause have the same referent, the subjunctive mood of the com-
plement clause cannot be marked by the choice of subject pronoun. This leaves
the clause-final particle, such as yé (permission, obligation), as the only means
of marking the subjunctive mood in the complement:Coreferential subject (fem.):(13) ta ín ne nùm ta ʔyá yé
     3F say ADP 3M.O 3F leave PERM
     ‘she1 told him she1 could leave’Coreferential subject (masc.):(14) mum ín ne nùm mum ʔyá yé
     3M say ADP 3M.O 3M leave PERM
     ‘he1 told him he1 could leave’Coreferentiality of the subject of the complement and matrix clauses can be
emphasized by the use of a coreferential non-perfective object pronoun after
the subject of the complement:(15) ta ín ne nùm ta sə ʔyá yé
     3F say ADP 3M.O 3F 3F.O leave PERM
     ‘she1 told him she1 could leave’(16) mum ín ne nùm mum um ʔyá yé
     3M say ADP 3M.O 3M 3M.O leave PERM
     ‘he1 told him he1 could leave’There appears to be no means of indicating the referential relationship
between the addressee of the matrix clause and the subject of the comple-
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

same reference, the subject of the complement is marked by a pronoun from
the subjunctive set:(17) hándày ín ne mbà mə́           ʔyá sí
     3PL      say ADP 1PL 1PL.SBJV leave EE
     ‘they told us we should leave’The subject of the complement is also marked by a pronoun from the subjunc-
tive set when the addressee and the subjunctive complement do not have the
same reference:(18) ə̀ŋ laʔ sə́ nə̀ mbə̀ ye
     2F say 3F 3M come SUBJ
     ‘you (fem.) tell her that he should come’When the complement is in the indicative mood there is no distinction
between the coreferentiality and lack of coreferentiality of the addressee and
the subject of the complement. This is also true of the subject of the comple-
ment (Gwà) and the possessor within the complement (‘his hoe’):(19) Taú ín ne kə          Gwà i           mum ɗúm wa kávà ùmù
     T. say ADP ASSC G. COMP 3M forget hoe 3M.POSS

In constructions consisting of a matrix clause followed by a complement, the
complement may or may not be preceded by a complementizer. Unlike in
some Chadic languages, such as Lele (East Chadic; Frajzyngier 2001), the pres-
ence or form of a complementizer following a verb of saying in Pévé does not
necessarily depend on whether the complement represents direct or indirect
speech.
   Markers used in constructions involving a matrix-clause verb of saying
include the inherent complementizer i and the impersonal pronoun na (see
chapter 11). Use of an impersonal pronoun as a complementizer in Pévé is much
like the use of the English form ‘that’, which may function as either a pronoun
or a complementizer depending on position and context. The Pévé form na,
which may occur independently or may be preceded by the complementizer i,
functions as a complementizer with only a small set of verbs, including làʔ ‘to
say, to tell’, in ‘to speak, to tell’, and ɗìk ‘to believe’ (see section 4, below). The
                                                                         Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

as well as with verbs of saying, as shown in later sections.","[285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290]"

2        Existing ApproachesThe alternation between a given morpheme with a final vowel and the same
morpheme without a final vowel has been subject to a variety of analyses in
Chadic linguistic literature. Most analyses (Barreteau and Le Bléis 1990, New-
man 2000, Frajzyngier with Shay 2002, Newman and Vanheuven 1981, and oth-
ers) view the contrast as being between a prepausal form, which has a final
vowel (in some cases a long vowel), and a non-prepausal or sentence-internal
form, which does not have a final vowel. In most such studies it is assumed
that the final vowel is underlying and that it is deleted in non-prepausal posi-
tion.
   Analyses based on the prepausal/non-prepausal contrast do not account for
contrasts of the type found in Pévé. In both of the following sentences the first-
person singular pronoun is phrase-final, yet one form has a final vowel and one

parsing morphology                                                               55does not. Either form can be followed by a pause. Phrase-internal vowel dele-
tion cannot be a factor, as the isolated 1SG pronoun has the form nàn rather
than *nàna:(1) ta gí    kwáti ne nàn-a
    3F make food ADP 1SG.O-FV
    ‘she made me some food’ (FV: final vowel)vs.(2) ta gí    kwáti ne nàn
    3F make food ADP 1SG.O
    ‘she made me some food’The question, therefore, is why a given morpheme has a final vowel in certain
utterances and not in others. As shown below, the distinction in Pévé between
the vowel-final form and the form without a final vowel occurs with lexical and
grammatical morphemes of many different categories.
   In Pévé, the contrast between the phrase-final added vowel and the absence
of an added vowel resembles, to some extent, the contrast between final vowel
addition and final vowel deletion in Wandala (Central Chadic). Frajzyngier
2016b describes the function of the two forms in Wandala, termed ‘parsing mor-
phology’, as follows:      While neither of the forms indicates any specific semantic relation, they
      both enable the listener to parse the sentence into units that can undergo
      further analysis and allow for inferences about a large number of seman-
      tic relations within the clause and within the sentence.
           Frajzyngier 2016b: 1While the concept of parsing morphology broadly applies to the alternation
between phrase-internal and phrase-final forms in Pévé, the function of pars-
ing morphology in Pévé differs from the forms and functions in Wandala, as
shown below. The following sections describe the form and distribution of
phrase-final vowels in Pévé and the functions of phrase-internal and phrase-
final forms.","[70, 71]"

example the resumptive pronoun ti refers to the head of the relative clause:(1) [ma     mə̀ ti     ɗí   fun]
    woman REL R.PRO cook food
    ‘the woman who cooked the food …’The resumptive pronoun ni after the relative marker mə̀ may refer to either a
masculine singular head or a plural head of unspecified gender. As shown in
later sections, the resumptive pronoun is not associated with any particular
grammatical function within the relative clause or the larger construction:(2) a. [swə          mə̀ ni      ɗám so        màn        ɗám so]
       man/person REL R.PRO build house 1SG.POSS build house

       ‘the person who built my house built his house, too’Cf. the plural:      b. [sõwã mə̀ ni         ɗám so      màn]        ɗám so  um

         tàʔ-à
         also-FV
         ‘the people who built my house built his house, too’When the relative clause itself functions as the object within a larger construc-
tion, the relative clause follows the main verb. As shown in later sections, this
is true regardless of the role of the relative head (bolded) within the relative
clause:(3) na wé [má       mə̀ ti      ɗí    fun]
    1SG see woman REL R.PRO cook food
    ‘I saw the woman who cooked the food’2.2     Deducible-Reference Marker
The end of the relative clause is often marked by a deducible-reference marker
(DED) reflecting the gender of the head of the relative clause. The marker often
has low tone, probably due to end-of-clause prosody. As shown in chapter 12,
the function of the deducible-reference markers rə (f.), nə (m.), or kunə (pl.) is
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

deducible reference marker follows a relative clause, the function of the rela-
tive clause is to narrow the scope of reference:(4) [yá náw mə̀ ɓú          rə̀]     mə̀ ná n-á
    cow        REL white DED.F REL 1SG I.PRO-FV
    ‘it is the white cow (lit. ‘the cow that is white’) that is mine’Evidence that the deducible reference marker is not a resumptive pronoun is
that the two markers can co-occur:(5) [swə mə̀ ni      ɬé nàn mbə́ ti         kə    ndi    nə̀]    bay
    man REL R.PRO take 1SG come here ASSC 3SG.O DED.M friend
    màn-à
    1SG.POSS-FV
    ‘the man who brought me here (lit. ‘took me [and] came here with me’)
    is my friend’Frajzyngier 1996 shows that in some Chadic languages the presence or absence
of a marker at the end of the relative clause is connected with the referential
status of the head of the relative clause, e.g. whether the head of the relative
clause is visible, previously mentioned, or known to the listener. As shown in
the following examples, the post-relative marker in Pévé does not encode such
distinctions:a. Known referent, followed by the phrase-final impersonal pronoun nə̀ (under-
lying form na). Use of the phrase-final marker is optional:(6) na wé      [swə mə̀ ni      mbə́ kə   rù ti (nə̀)] sí
    1SG know man REL R.PRO come ASSC 2M here DED.M ASSERT
    ‘I know the man who brought you here’b. Unknown referent, which may also be followed by the impersonal pronoun

ment followed by mə̀, has the function of object within the relative clause.
The relative marker mə̀ is usually followed by the resumptive pronoun ti or
ni, evidence that the resumptive pronoun is not associated with any particu-
lar grammatical function.
   Because the head of the relative clause is always the first component of the
relative clause, the role of a non-subject head within the relative clause must
be deduced from the presence or absence of other arguments within the rela-
tive clause. In the following example, the role of kwáti ‘food’ as object within
the relative clause is deduced from the presence of the subject pronoun ta
before the verb in the relative clause, resulting in the form O REL R.PRO S V
(DED):(8) [kwáti mə̀ ni        ta gí      nə̀] kəɗám-á
    food REL R.PRO 3F make DED.M good-FV
    ‘the food that she prepared is good’Similarly, in the next example the object role of kwá ‘thing’ is deduced from
the presence of the subject pronoun nambà before the verb within the relative
clause:(9) [kwá mə̀ tà kə         syem mə̀ ni         nambà wé nə̀]       kəlìŋ
    thing REL go ASSC feet REL R.PRO 1PL                see DED.M rat

    I.PRO-FV
    ‘the animal (‘thing that walks on legs’) that we saw is a rat’In the preceding examples the relative clause functions as the subject of the
larger construction, in each case a verbless identificational predication (see
chapter 11). When the larger construction containing the relative clause in-
volves a predicate, the function of the relative clause as subject of the larger
construction is indicated by the position of the relative clause before the main
verb:(10) [má     mə̀ ti      ha wé rə] mbə́ si
     woman REL R.PRO 2M saw DED.F come REL
     ‘the woman you saw has come’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

its position after the main verb. In the following examples the relative clause is
the object of the larger construction and the head of the relative clause is the
object within the relative clause:(11) ná túk [kwátí mə̀ ní           tá gí nə̀ kə̀ɗámá]
     1SG feel food REL R.PRO 3F do DED.M good
     ‘I liked the food that she prepared.’(12) na tsóɓ       [ndáʔ mə uráʔ-a]
     1SG bought horse REL black-FV
     ‘I bought a black horse (‘horse that is black’)’ or ‘I bought the black horse’(13) handày fól          ya nãw mə̀ kə         gáɓ kunə tsóp-ó
     3PL      slaughter cow REL ASSC illness PL first-FV
     ‘they slaughter the sick cows (lit. ‘cows that are with illness’) first’The head of the relative clause can function as indirect object within the rel-
ative clause. The role of the head as indirect object is deduced from the fact
that the verb in the relative clause is followed by two arguments (see sə (3F.O)
and ɗerwa ‘book’ in example 14, below). As shown in chapter 6, when two
arguments follow the verb, the first argument after the verb has the function
of indirectly affected object, in this case the recipient. Note that the indirect
object head of the relative clause is represented by the resumptive pronoun ti:(14) na wə         gi lekol wanji      kə      [vay ma      mə ti na

     ‘I go to the same school as the girl to whom I gave a book’As shown in the preceding and following examples, the relative clause may
function as the object of a preposition within the larger construction. As is the
case with other prepositional phrases, the relative clause follows the preposi-
tion:(15) múm mbə́ kə          [kwá mə̀ ní          há né nùm nə       sí]
     3M come ASSC thing REL R.PRO 2M give 3M DED.M EE

tive clause, where ‘adjunct’ means a lexical item, phrase, or clause that can
be added to almost any construction (see chapter 21). The role of the head as
addressee within the relative clause is marked by the associative preposition
kə followed by a pronoun from the set coding inalienable possession/object of
a preposition (see chapter 5). The function of the relative clause as subject of
the larger construction is marked, as elsewhere, by the position of the relative
clause before the main verb:(16) [má     mə ti      na ge dàn                  mə kə  sə wə

     ‘the woman whom I talked with in Maroua has arrived’The locative role of the head of the relative clause can be marked by the demon-
strative han, which indicates anaphoric reference to a location that is not the
place of speech (see chapter 12). When the head of the relative clause is a loca-
tive complement, the resumptive pronoun has the masculine/plural form ni:(17) ɓay [mota         mə̀nahã                    rawtirùm]
     ɓay [mota         mə        ni na han rawti             rùm]

     ‘Then the car that I was sitting in there managed to cross the river at four
     o’clock in the morning.’Like other relative clauses, the clause with a locative head may be followed by a
deducible reference marker (in bold). As elsewhere, the object role of the rela-
tive clause in the larger sentence is marked by the position of the relative clause
after the main verb:
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

5       Deictic Relative ClausesIn nearly all of the examples cited above there is a predicate within the relative
clause. Exceptions are equational, identificational and other predications that
are verbless as stand-alone clauses. When the relative clause does not contain
a predicate, the resumptive pronouns ni and ti function as markers of proximal
deixis, as in the following examples:(19) [swə mə̀ ni       nə]      púm nùm-u
     man REL R.PRO DED.M hit 3M-FV
     ‘the man who is here hit him’In the following sentence, the relative clause functions as the head of another
relative clause:(20) [ya nãw mə̀ ni        kunə] mə̀ handày n-á
     cow      REL R.PRO DED.PL REL 3PL.POSS I.PRO-FV
     ‘these cows (‘cows that are here’) are theirs (‘that are theirs’)’It is very likely that the proximal demonstratives ti and ni are the source of the
resumptive pronouns ti and ni. Evidence that ti and ni in a verbless relative
clause have a function that is different from the function of ti and ni in a relative
clause that involves a predicate is provided by the fact that the distal demon-
stratives dáyʔ (fem.) and náyʔ (masc.) can also be used in a verbless relative
clause:(21) [ya nãw mə dáyʔ rə́]               mə mùm            n-á
     cow      REL DIST.F DED.F REL 3M.POSS I.PRO-FV
     ‘that cow is his’ (lit. ‘the cow that is there is his’)(22) [mi mə̀ náyʔ] su
     what REL DIST.M Q
     ‘what is that?’
                                                                       Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

the deictic demonstrative. The significance of this variation remains to be
explored:(23) à kat [sõwã (mə) náyʔ            kun-a]
     2M look people (REL) DIST.M DED.PL-FV
     ‘look at those people (‘people who are there’)!’The deducible reference marker can co-occur with the resumptive pronoun ni
or ti in the deictic function, as it can in the non-deictic function:(24) [swə (mə̀) ni     nə]       púm nùm-u
     man REL R.PRO DED.M hit 3M-FV
     ‘this man (‘man who is here’) hit him’
6       ConclusionThe basic form of the relative clause is Noun REL R.PRO … (DED), where Noun
is the head of the relative clause, REL is the relative marker mə, R.PRO is a
resumptive pronoun that reflects the number and gender (if singular) of the
head of the relative clause, and DED is a deducible-reference determiner from
the set rə (fem.), nə (masc.), and kunə (pl.), described in chapter 12. The pres-
ence of the deducible-reference determiner at the end of the relative clause
indicates that the function of the clause is to narrow the scope of reference for
the hearer. The resumptive pronouns ti and ni are probably derived from the
proximal deictic demonstratives discussed in chapter 12. Evidence for this is
that ti or ni functions as a deictic demonstrative in a relative clause that does
not contain a predicate. In all instances, the syntactic function of the relative
clause within the larger construction is indicated by the position of the relative
clause with respect to the main verb and by the presence or absence of other
arguments in the larger construction.","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274]"
"3.2.1      Pronoun as Direct Object: Perfective Set
A very important distinction between the perfective set of object pronouns and
the non-perfective set has to do with how the function of direct object is coded.
As shown below, the direct object function of a pronoun from the perfective
set is marked by the position immediately after the verb in both the perfective
aspect and the subjunctive mood (SVO), while the direct object function of a
pronoun from the non-perfective set is marked by the position before the verb
(SOV; see below).
   Like subject pronouns, object pronouns convey the gender of the second-
or third-person referent and the number of the first, second-, or third-person
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

An object pronoun from the non-perfective set can be used to represent the
direct object in all non-perfective indicative constructions but cannot be used
in subjunctive constructions. The perfective/subjunctive object set is repeated
in Table 9 (above) for purposes of comparison.
   The existence of two sets of object pronouns distinguished by tense, aspect
and mood is relatively rare across languages. The fact that most object pro-
nouns in the perfective set in Pévé have an initial n suggests that a marker n(V)
may once have had the function of distinguishing the object in a perfective
clause from the object in a non-perfective clause. It is also possible that the
marker n(V) at one time served as a postverbal marker of perfective aspect,
resulting in the following tentative path of evolution: Verb+nV Pronoun > Verb
nV Pronoun > Verb nV+Pronoun.
   As shown in chapter 8, non-perfective tenses and aspects may be marked by
(a) use of the unmarked tone on the verb, or (b) a preverbal marker followed by
the verb with unmarked tone. When the direct object in a non-perfective and
non-subjunctive clause is marked by a pronoun, the pronoun follows the tense
or aspect marker and precedes the main verb, resulting in the order Subject
Tense/Aspect (T/A) marker Object Verb. (The term T/A is used instead of the
usual term TAM (tense/aspect/mood) because mood is not indicated by mark-
ers before, after, or attached to the verb; it is instead indicated by the choice of
pronoun forms and phrase-final particles (see chapter 9)). The means of coding

different from the means of coding the direct object function of a pronoun in
a perfective clause (see above), where the pronominal direct object immedi-
ately follows the verb. Recall that the nominal direct object in a clause with
only one non-subject argument immediately follows the verb, regardless of the
tense, aspect, or mood of the clause. Thus, the only situation in which the direct
object precedes the verb is the non-perfective/non-subjunctive clause that has
a pronominal object:
   Here are some examples contrasting the position of the non-perfective
object pronoun with that of the perfective object pronoun:Imperfective aspect (S T/A OV):(53) lum wə́       sə́ ti
     lion IMPF 3F.O eat
     ‘the lion is eating it’Cf. the perfective form (SVO):(54) lum tí sá

     smell meat IMPF 1SG.O bother-FV
     ‘the smell of the meat is bothering me’

     3M FUT 3F.O buy tomorrow(-FV)
     ‘he will buy it tomorrow’In a clause that has the same arguments and the same temporal value, the direct
object in the form of a full noun follows rather than precedes the verb, resulting
in the form S T/A VO:(59) mum də̀ tsòɓ vu síw(-i)
     3M FUT buy salt tomorrow-FV
     ‘he will buy salt tomorrow’(60) mum wə́       tsòɓ vu
     3M PRES buy salt
     ‘he is buying salt (now)’In a non-perfective clause, the marker coding future tense or imperfective
aspect is often omitted in natural discourse. If the direct object is pronomi-
nal, the use of a pronoun from the non-perfective set and the position of the
pronoun before the verb indicates that the clause is non-perfective, i.e. neither
perfective nor subjunctive. Whether the clause is interpreted as imperfective
or future depends on the context and the nature of the event:(61) ha màn yè         si
     2M 1SG.O know ASSERT
     ‘You know me.’ or ‘You will know me.’
4       Indirect ObjectIn Pévé, means of distinguishing between the function of indirect object and
the function of direct object include the relative order of constituents in the
clause and the use of the designated indirect object marker ne, derived from
the noun ne ‘give’. The form ne is glossed ‘ADP’ for ‘adposition’, as it sometimes
occurs before the noun or pronoun representing the indirect object and some-
times occurs after the noun or pronoun representing the indirect object (see
below). As shown in Améka 2003, the use of the same adposition in either
prenominal or postnominal position is very rare across languages (the exam-
ple Améka 2003 provides comes from Dutch, as described in Van Riemsdijk
1990). As shown below, the means of coding the grammatical role of the indi-
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

the presence or absence of an overt direct object.
   While the precise semantic role of the indirect object is a function of the
inherent meaning of the verb and the arguments in the clause, the indirect
object is typically less directly affected by the event than is the direct object.
The semantic roles of indirect object arguments include the recipient of a thing
given, the beneficiary of the event, the addressee of certain verbs, and a par-
ticipant who suffers from the event (‘malefactive’). The semantic roles of the
indirect object are further discussed in chapter 7.
   The following sections describe the means of marking the indirect object
role of a nominal argument, the means of marking the indirect object role of a
pronominal argument in a perfective or subjunctive clause, and the means of
marking the indirect object role of a pronominal argument in a non-perfective
clause.","[128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"

2        Temporal AdjunctsPévé has a rich set of temporal nouns and noun phrases, some of which are
listed below. Most of these nouns function as temporal adjuncts without addi-
tional marking. Most may have either deictic or non-deictic reference, e.g., tám
‘today’ (deictic) or ‘these days, now’ (non-deictic); kum ‘yesterday’ (deictic) or
‘the past’ (non-deictic):wə́ta       ‘last year’
wãy         ‘three days ago’; ‘three days before (some point in time)’; ‘latest,
            most recent’
kum         ‘yesterday’; ‘in the past’
tám         ‘today’; ‘in the present’
ʃiw         ‘tomorrow’
sədayʔ      ‘the day after tomorrow’ or ‘two days after (some point in time)’
sədayʔ dayʔ ‘the day after the day after tomorrow’ or ‘three days after (some
            point in time)’
wãy zaʔ kum ‘the day before yesterday’ or ‘two days before’ (lit. ‘three days ago
            plus yesterday’)

lowed by a temporal noun: kə bə̀kà/ fə̀tà/riya ‘morning, afternoon, evening’. The
phrase kə fə̀tà (ASSC ‘sun’) is also used to refer to the dry season. Adding a deic-
tic noun or deictic determiner makes the temporal reference deictic, as in tám
kə bə̀kà or kə bə̀kà ni ‘this morning’:(1) Taú tá         lúmò tám kə         bə̀kà

    ‘today she sold all the milk’As is the case in many languages, the adverbials kum ‘yesterday’ and tám ‘today’
may code broad reference to the past and the present, respectively. In the next
example the adjunct zaʔ ‘still’ (also ‘plus’, as in wãy zaʔ kum, above), combined
with negation, emphasizes the fact that the state does not obtain at the present
time:(7) ta ké       ɓáy kum           àmá tám ta tsú ɓáy zaʔ mi

    ‘she used to be pretty, but she isn’t pretty anymore’ (note the use of kum
    ‘yesterday’ in broad reference to the past)The preposition zə̀ ‘for, under’ followed by a temporal noun marks the noun as
coding duration of the event:(8) mum súk kə mbà zə̀              bə̀kà ki ̃ ́

     ‘she will sell it another tomorrow’ (for ‘she will sell it in a week’)Reference to time on a clock is coded by the associative preposition kə followed
by the phrase ndʒike (‘iron’) + Numeral. The term ‘iron’ goes back to to the
metal watches introduced decades ago by Europeans. The distinction between
morning and evening is coded by the marker mə followed by a temporal noun
or noun phrase: mə rìyà ‘afternoon’, mə (vun) bə̀kà ‘morning’ (‘mouth of the
day/morning’) or mə (gaʔ) bə̀kà (‘side of the day/morning’).

adverbials, gwáʔ occurs between the subject and the verb. This is a feature that
gwáʔ shares with the conditional marker làʔ (cf. chapter 18), the future tense
marker də̀, the aspect markers wə́ (IMPF) and ké (progressive aspect), and the
auxiliary gàk ‘to be able’. Since làʔ and də̀ are clearly derived from verbs (làʔ
‘to say’, də̀ ‘to go’), it is likely that gwáʔ ‘then’ and other preverbal markers are
also of verbal origin. The following examples show the use of gwáʔ in natural
discourse:(17) dzənàk      gwáʔ ɗámvərùm-u                  mə̀ na tsu mi

3       Associative and Instrumental AdjunctsAs shown in chapter 5, the associative preposition kə may conjoin two nouns
within a single noun phrase. When the noun marked by the associative prepo-

     ‘Tau went to the market with Gwa’Cf. the conjoined noun phrase:(22) Taú kə     Gwà tá lúmò

     ‘they came to help each other’The preposition wa ‘on’ followed by the reciprocal ndʒì codes a similar function.
The preposition wa is probably derived from the noun ‘head’, used in other con-
structions as a spatial preposition (chapter 10):(26) nambà mbə́ gí sin wa          ndʒì
     1PL    come do work PREP RECIP

concurrent with the event of the main clause. The verb in the concurrent clause

marker go, with the underlying form gwáʔ, is glossed as ‘now’, as its function is

5       Intensity, Repetition, and RecurrenceThis section describes adjuncts coding repetition, recurrence, or intensity of an
event. Some adjuncts are single lexical items, some are derived through dupli-
cation, and others are prepositional phrases.
   As shown in chapter 5, reduplication of the verb conveys some meanings
that are conveyed by adverbs in many other languages, such as intensity or rep-
etition of the event:(45) tʃiʔ vay wə́      màn gu(n)-gun-u
     cry child IMPF 1SG.O bother-bother-FV
     ‘the child’s crying always/each time bothers me’ (‘rep.’: repetition of
     event)(46) tú     màn          ti-ti
     body 1SG.POSS eat.eat (intrans.)
     ‘I am very sick’ (lit. ‘my body is eating me’)Intensity can also be conveyed by the clause-final modifier ɓáyrúm ‘very, much’.
The scope of the modifier is the entire clause:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘I was a person who was a good drummer.’Evidence that ɓáyrúm is not an inherent adverb is that it may function as the
modifier in a verbless clause:(51) tsoɓ rum ɓáyrúm-u

1 The use of the adverbial tòʔ, meaning ‘near the speaker’, is an error when used with the phrase
  gaʔ dayʔ ‘that side’. However, the adverbial tòʔ can be used with the phrase gaʔ ti ‘this side’.","[316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326]"
"4.1       Compound Verbs
Many verbs in Pévé are derived through compounding, where a compound is
defined as two or more independent words that function as a single lexical item.
As is the case with many compounds across languages, the meaning of the com-
pound is not necessarily predictable from the meaning of its components.
    Many attested compound verbs in Pévé consist of a verb followed by a noun,
e.g. dàm kwá ‘to sew’ (dàm ‘to pluck’+kwá ‘thing’); nde ʃy ̩èn: ‘to fall asleep’
(nde ‘to fall’+ ʃyèn ‘mat, place for sleeping’); tá rəkway ‘to travel’ (tà ‘to go, to
walk’+rəkway ‘stranger’ (probably derived from the noun ri ‘place’ followed by
an unidentified morpheme)); and káwri ‘arrive’ (káw ‘grab’+ri ‘place’). There is
at least one compound with three components: gi tsoɓ kwá ‘to sell’ (gi ‘make’+
tsoɓ ‘purchase (N)’, kwá ‘thing’), which serves as a colloquial form of the com-
pound gi tsoɓ ‘to sell’.
    In some cases the noun within a compound has the same form as a verb with
a related meaning. For example, the noun tsoɓ ‘purchase’ in the compound gi
tsoɓ ‘to sell’ has the same form as the verb tsoɓ ‘to buy’, and the noun ɣaw ‘fight’
in the compound gi ɣaw ‘to cause a fight, to get into a fight’ has the same form
as the verb ɣaw ‘to fight’. For this reason, one could argue that such compounds
are actually serial verbs. If one accepts that tsoɓ and ɣaw do represent nouns,
one could argue that the noun is not part of a compound but instead func-
tions as the direct object of the preceding verb. Both approaches are addressed
below.
    Evidence that the second component of the compound verbs listed above is
a noun and not a verb, and therefore is not part of a serial verb construction,
is that the pronominal direct object following the verb is represented by a pos-
sessive pronoun from the inalienable set (see chapter 5) rather than a pronoun
from the object set. In the next example, the pronominal direct object is rep-
resented by the inalienable possessive pronoun rum. If tsoɓ were a verb in this
construction, there would be no possessum for the possessive pronoun rum to
modify:
                                                                       Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     1SG sell         3M.POSS ASSERT
     ‘I sold it’ (lit. ‘I made/caused its purchase’)Compare with the clause below, in which tsoɓ functions as a verb. Here, the
object is marked by a pronoun from the perfective direct object set (see chap-
ters 5 and 6):(15) na tsóɓ nùm si
     1SG buy 3M.O ASSERT
     ‘I bought it’Evidence that the noun within the compound does not function as the object
of the verb that precedes it is provided by the fact that another nominal or
pronominal direct object may follow the compound. In the following example,
səlay ‘money’ is the direct object of the compound verb gé də̀wã, consisting of
the verb ge ‘to throw’ followed by the noun də̀wã ‘back, nape of neck’. If də̀wã
were in fact the direct object of gé, the noun səlay could not occur in this posi-
tion:(16) kəri rùm         ndày     fáŋ kàw                Taobày ndày faŋ …

     nùm-u
     3M.POSS-FV
     ‘Then they arrested Taobay and they returned—he gave his money—
     Monitor Lizard’s (money)—back to him.’The next example involves the compound verb gí tsoɓ ‘sell’; the direct object
mbìr ‘milk’, whose function is marked by the position after the compound verb;
and the indirect object nù, whose function as recipient is marked by the adpo-
sition ne. As there is no possible construction *S V O O IO, it is clear that tsoɓ
is part of the compound verb rather than the object of the preceding verb
gí:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

compound—i.e., the verb—has the high tone that marks the perfective aspect:(18) mum gí tsoɓ ya nãw wə         lúmò
     3M sell       cow PREP market
     ‘he sold a cow at the market’The word tsoɓ alone, with the verbal function ‘to buy’, has high tone in the per-
fective aspect:(19) na tsóɓ vú kúm-ú
     1SG buy salt yesterday-FV
     ‘I bought salt yesterday’Compound verbs of the form Verb+Noun co-exist with serial verb construc-
tions of the form Verb+Verb (see chapter 10 and later chapters). The prolifer-
ation of compound verbs and serial verbs in Pévé allows the verbal piece to
express a number of fine distinctions that in some other languages might be
expressed periphrastically or through the use of verbal extensions or modifiers.","[86, 87, 88]"

2        TopicalizationIn Pévé, as in many subject-initial languages, a constituent or phrase that is not
the subject of the clause may be topicalized by being placed at the beginning
of the clause. The grammatical role of the topicalized constituent may or may
not be overtly marked in the comment clause.
   When the topicalized constituent refers to an inanimate entity that func-
tions as the direct object in the comment clause, its role in the comment clause
is not overtly marked. This is consistent with the absence of overt coding of the
inanimate direct object in other constructions (see chapters 6 and 12):(1) ã … eh, sém mi           dʔe má su

    meat dog           1SG NEG like NEG
    ‘dog meat, I don’t like (it)’The function of a fronted direct object whose grammatical role in the comment
clause is overtly marked is described in section 3.2, below.
   When the fronted argument plays a role other than direct object in the com-
ment clause, the topicalized entity is marked by the phrase dàn Noun DED,
where dàn has the meaning ‘word, topic’, ‘Noun’ represents the topicalized
argument, and the determiner is from the deducible reference set rə and nə (see
chapter 12). Note that the topicalized entities below function as possessors, not
direct objects, in the comment clause:(3) làʔ        dàn ndáʔ nə          si          Taú də̀ gi tsoɓ rum-u
    COND word horse DED.M ASSERT T. FUT sell                         3M.POSS-FV
    ‘if it’s about the horse, Tau will do his sale’ (i.e., sell him)(4) làʔ        dàn ya nãw rə          si        Taú də̀ gi tsoɓ s-á
    COND word cow            DED.F ASSERT T. FUT sell              3F.POSS-FV
    ‘if it’s about the cow, Tau will do her sale’ (i.e., sell her)When the topicalized element is a locative complement its role in the comment
clause is marked by the demonstrative han (see chapter 12), which is used only
in anaphoric reference to a location:(5) Mora (pause) na tá han sem ráw-a
    M.             1SG go there times many-FV
    ‘Mora, I have been there many times’Because the subject is the first constituent in the neutral clause (i.e. a clause
without a topicalized constituent), fronting is not a sufficient means for topi-
calizing the subject. The topicalized subject has the form of a headless relative
clause, where the topicalized subject is preceded by the relative marker mə and
followed by the deducible reference marker nə or rə (see chapter 17 for the func-
tion of nə or rə as postrelative marker). The grammatical role of the topicalized
subject constituent is indicated by a resumptive pronoun within the comment
clause:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

    ASSERT
    ‘as for Tau, he went to the market today’The deducible reference marker can be omitted, provided there is a pause after
the topicalized constituent:(7) mə Taú (pause) mum tá lúmò tám kə          bə̀kà   si
    REL T.             3M go market today ASSC morning ASSERT
    ‘as for Tau, he went to the market today’In the following elicited verbless clause there is no marker either before or after
the topicalized subject. The only indication of topicalization is the pause after
the topicalized constituent Gwà and the indicative subject pronoun tá in the
comment clause. The clause-final impersonal pronoun na marks the verbless
equational clause (see chapter 11):(8) Gwà, tá ndzar-rín           mə̀ mbə̀rí na
    G.    3F sister-1SG.POSS REL older I.PRO
    ‘Gwa, she is my older sister’Cf. without the indicative pronoun:(9) Gwà ndzar-rín           mə̀ mbə̀rí na
    G. sister-1SG.POSS REL older I.PRO
    ‘Gwà is my older sister’
3       FocusA variety of constituents can be placed in focus, including nouns, modifiers,
and predicates. The chief formal difference between topicalization and focus is
that the focused element is not fronted but remains in situ, where its grammati-
cal role is marked by the same means used in the neutral clause. Recall that Pévé
does not draw a formal distinction between contrastive and non-contrastive
focus.","[257, 258, 259]"
