"       Thus, the location particles in Particle + Verb Constructions are not
prefixes. However, they can become cliticized. This occurs when some other
pan of the sentence is given prominent stress for emphasis or clarification. and
when the panicles are contracted, as seen in (90).(90)   a. ['a wegwaL]                                     Gwal]

Clitics
          Clitics are bound words. The word it binds to in the phrase or clause is
called its host. hust as affixes can be prefixes or suffixes, clitics can attach to
the beginning (pre-clitic) or the end (post-clitic) of a word. Euchee has both pre-
clitics and post-clitics. Unlike affixes, which are bound to a specific part of
speech, clitics attach to a constituent. either a phrase or clause. For example. the
noun classes always move to the end of the noun phrase, so they may appear
after a bare noun, or a quantifier, or an adejctive; they are not always attached
to the noun itself. Since clitics can attach to several different hosts, they are
more loose1y bound than affixes. In Euchee, all one-sy llable independent
particles are stressed. If they are not stressed, due to emphasis elsewhere. they
can become cliticized to a host. The difference between ciitics and independent
words. then, is mainly phonological.
          The Yes/No question particle 'le is an irrealis mode particle. It is always
an independent word. It is not phonologically reduced, but carries with it a
prominent stress. However, it has characteristics of a clause-level clitic. It
prefers to be after the first complete phrase in a clause, called a 'second position'
clitic. While Ye prefers the second position, it can be placed at the end of any
constituent in the clause. Because of this, it is a good test for constituency in
Euchee, Chapter 8, Section 3.1 Yes/No Questions for examples.
          Most of the independent particles can be several phrase-level clitics when
unstressed. These attach to the phrase which they modify, and are typified by
the noun class/determiner post-clitics, the piural particle, the tense particle. This
is similar to the English 'not,' which must be attached to a host when it is
phonologically reduced, as in 'doesn't.'
          Only the negative pre-clitic nP- - me- is always attached and can never be
an independent particle. The negative pre-clitic attaches to the besinning of
either the noun or the verb phrase, similar to the English 'I do not have any
urandchildren' and 'I have no grandchildren.'"" The evidence that they are bound
r'
and not free comes from the fact they follow the stress patterns of the verb and
noun. The negative pre-clitic bears secondary stress of the first syllable,
although they are often emphasized for pragmatic purposes. See Chapter 8.
Section 4 Negation.","[121, 122, 123]"
"4. NEGATION
       Euchee has two negative pre-clitics n2- and h&-. The negative pre-critic
nP- is the most productive today.",[502]
"
       The affirmative answer hb 'yes' also functions as a mode panicle at the
end of an utterance."" Wagner (1934: 354) states that hb is an emphatic suffix.
The affirmative hb is emphatic in the sense that when ones affirms one
commitment to a future action or affirms one's belief that something is possible,
it is generally more emphatic than withodi such confirmation. However, the
basic conlent and function is one of affirming and confirming not emphasis.
                                  -
       The affirmative hb - [hJ] [hv], and sometimes [hC], is used to confirm
one's commitment to a future action. It is most common when offering to do
something, such as the example from (52) above. It is provided again here in
(95a). It is also used when giving permission, as in (95b).

"Although the Yes/No question particle is in second position, its placement with
the negative pre-clitic can also be due to the focus on the negative in negative
questions.",[481]
"
Negative Phrase
       The sentential negative phrase is a pre-clitic on the verb phrase. The
Yes/No question panicle comes after the negative phrase, and so negative
cliticizes to the Yes/No question panicle.(18)   a. Nele k'ashz?                   'Aren't you eating?

       The quantifier sala means 'all of (a group).' Like whale 'many,' if the
quantifier follows a noun, the noun must be in the plural. The quantifier sala is
also used to express the indefinite pronouns 'everything' and 'everybody.' The
forms of sala follow in (30).(30)   sala 'all of (a group)' 'everyone'       hisala             'all of them, everything'

       Pndzesala          'all of you all'       The adverb hile also expresses 'all, ' but it is not verbal, and so it does not
change form.
       The negative quantification 'most of or 'much of is fonned by adding the
negative pre-clitic nP- to 'all.' Thus, 'most of and 'a few of is literally 'not all of.'
The negative form are nzhisala. ne'wesala etc...
       The quantifier dzalale means 'both of (a plural).' It can also mean ?hose

 a reciprocating or accompanying situation'. See Chapter 4, Section 3.3 for more
discussion and examples of k'aju. The reciprocal k'aju 'together' also has
 pronominal agreement. When it refers to inanimates, it has the meaning 'both'
 and generally has the stative -le, as seen in (32).","[456, 457, 458]"
"
4.3 PROBABILITY
             /ere         Probability, such a s 'might' 'probably' is expressed with the mode auxiliary
lere   - ledi (BPD). The irrealis particle gd 'potential' also expresses 'might.'
However, in general the potential is used for situations which have not yet
occurred and to express politeness. In contrast, the probability auxiliary lete
tends to express the speakers belief about a present situation. However. these
can be interchanged, and the potential gd can be combined with the auxiliary to
express doubt about the future.
         The probability auxiliary is used with the active verbalizer. As such, it is
commonly used a s a complete expression. In (@a) below, the l l ~ r e 2is a general
non-committal answer 'maybe.' With the ability re attached, the response is 'it
could be,' as in (64b). In ( 6 4 ~ ) is
                                     . a similar response 'maybe' using the auxiliary
re, combined with encouragement ICP and the affirmative hb. However, this is
usually restricted to giving consent, pemission, or some future commitment on
the part of the speaker. Finally, the sentence in (64d) is often used to express
'maybe.'

"
3.1 Y ES/NOQUESTIONS: t E AND 'YA
        Yes/No questions are a type of question where the expected answer is
'yes' or 'no.' Yes/No questions are fonned with the irrealis mode particle ye,?
although )a can be used in the conditions described below. In addition to a
mode particle, Yes/No questions are signaled by rising intonation.
        Wagner (1934: 357) called the particle 'Ie a suffix and described the
placement as verb final, except for the attachment to the negative pre-clitic n2-.
This overlooks two importatn facts about Ye. First, it can be found at the end of
most complete phrases (noun phrase, postposition phrase, verb phrase). Second,
it has a propensity to be found in the second position (in the position after the
first phrase of a sentence). These facts make it a likely candidate for a clitic (or
bound word). However, there is evidence that the morpheme is an independent
word. First, 'Ze is not reduced phonologically but always bears the most
prominent stress of the utterance and is generally accompanied by high pitch.
Second, like other irrealis particles, 7e can be the verbalizer for verbal nouns.
       The Yes/No question marker 'le prefers to be in the second position, that
is, after the end of the first phrase. When there is an independent noun phrase,
the panicle can be in second positon (after the noun phrase) or after the verb
phrase. In these positions, the question marker has scope over the whole
sentence. If the particle comes after any other phrase, it changes the focus to
that phrase.
       Because the Yes/No question marker 'le must appear at the end of a
phrase, it can be used as a test to determine the boundaries of phrases
(constituents). The end of phrases often coincides with the end of words, and as
such, it has been helpful in determining suffixes from clitics. Therefore, most of
the patterns are given below to amply illustrate its placement. Although not all
the possible sentence patterns are given in the sections below. the rule that the
Yes/No question particle must be at the end of a complete phrase and its
preference for second position is illustrated in the common sentence patterns
below. These are followed by the exceptions.","[477, 478]"
"       The affirmative can also confirm one's knowledge about a past event or
state. An example is in (96a). Using -hd with past events often gives an
emphatic quality to the statement, as in (96b).",[344]
"The verb go2 is derived from k l 'to accompany' and the verbalizer z . ~
' This order is a little odd for an A-P-V (SOV) language. One expects to find
the copula immediately following the verbal noun. This order is also inconsistent
with the rest of verbalization in the language. which is found after the verbalized
pan of speech.
- An alternative word for 'green, blue' is hifa. However, it does not seem to be
in widespread usage.
  Wagner (ca. 1935: 47) gives 'have' as kl 'to be with.' See Chapter 4, Section
3.3 for the stem uses of k5.

         This chapter describes how noun phrases, verb phrases (including the
verbals structures), and particles are put together to form longer utterances.
People do many things with language. We make statements concerning the
world around us (declarative sentences). We ask questions, and sometimes
command someone to do or not to do something. Each of these kinds of
utterances has one (or more) specific constructions. Statement, question, and
command forms can then be used for a variety of other functions. For example,
questions can be used to make requests or invitations. Statements can also show
empathy, expectation, or obligation. These functions are shown through the
mode particles and auxiliaries following verbs and are found in Chapter 5. The
first three sections of this chapter describes the construction (syntax) of utterance
types.
         In addition to types of utterances, an utterance may be simple or complex.
A simple sentence has one clause. A clause has one main verb which shows
agreement and may show tense, aspect and mode. Chapters 3 and 4 developed
the verb phrase with pronominal agreement. The inflected verb phrase is the
simplest complete clause in Euchee. A complex sentence has more than one
clause. The second clause may be embedded within the main clause, or the two
clauses may be joined one after the other with a coordinating conjunction.
         Sentences that are manipulated to focus the most important information in
the sentence are given in the section 7.
       This section describes the basic word order for Euchee. Although the
noun phrase is free to move into many places, the word order in daily usage is
fairly constant. Changes in word order generally create a change in focus and or
for topicalization.'
       The basic word order in a one-place declarative sentence is Actor (A) or

Patient (P), then Verb (V). These orders are illustrated below.

        Because the information on the participants is marked on the verbs, it also
allows the noun phrases to move. Speakers can still undenand who is doing
what to whom because that pronominal prefixes make it clear, even if the Agent
and/or Patient is not in their usual places. In the sentence below 'Sissy loves
Sonny,' the pronominal agreement on the verb is sio-. This informs the hearer
that the actor is female, so 'Sissy' must be the actor (the person doing the loving,
not receiving the love). The possible word orders are shown in (2a-c). The basic
word order (APV)is given first. The examples in (2d-f) have an asterix (*)
because they are impossible word orders.","[466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472]"

"Ability: Te Can'       The ability of the actor to complete the action in the verb may be due to
'internal' or 'external' forces. Internal force refers to the actor's physical abilities,
mental abilities, or willingness to help. External force refers to social conditions,
such as prior commitments or obligation to family and elders. The auxiliary verb
re 'able' is used for both kinds of ability.
       The examples give simple sentences which illustrate the basic use of re
'ability' in relationship to the main verb. In (35a) gives the ability 'can.' In (35b).
the Yes/No question particle comes between the auxiliary re and the verb. In
(35c) the negative ability 'can't' is given: it is predictably formed by the negative

"       Since 'anotherlthe other' are more referential than the other quantifiers,
 and they can be pronouns, as in 'the other one,' they are more fully described in
 Chapter 6 Noun and Noun phrase.
        Singular quantifiers refer to a all or part of a singular object. They are
formed with a singular noun. In Euchee, there is only one singular quantifier.
        The quantifier johi refers to all of a singular object. When the quantifier
johi follows a noun, the noun must be in the singular, and the pronominal
prefixes refer to singular entities.

           LOCATION,
4. EXISTENCE,     AND POSSESSION
       The expression 'ake'eoften shortened to ke'e has a variety of different
meanings and uses. The phrase is the verbalized location ' M e 'there.' And
although it may at one time have been purely existential 'there is,' the phrase has
the more emphatic feeling today. it can mean 'that's the way it is' or 'it is that
way.' It can mean '(to do something) in this manner.' It can be the comparative
'to be like (something else).' And it can mean 'to seem, feel like.' The phrase is
essential to everyday Euchee. Some speakers pepper their speech with the
phrase, and nearly all recall it as being something that they always used to hear
 he old people using.
       The most common use of 'ake'e is 'that's the way it is.' It can atso mean
That's right.' The phrase is often given by itself. It can take all tense, aspect,
and mode. When the phrase is the complete sentence, it requires fa 'perfective'
in the simple present tense because the way something is can only be seen as a
whole. However, the perfective in the present tense is irregular. A few
examples are given below. The terse or mode particles are underlined. The
stress is always on the last syllable of the stem 'diand so the particles are
written as cliticized.","[459, 460, 461]"

       This section describes complex sentences which have two clauses: an
independent (main) clause and a dependent (embedded) clause. An independent
clause is fully inflected with agreement, and can be inflected for aspect, tense,
and mode. It can be a complete sentence by itself. A dependent clause relies
on another clause for part of its inflection or meaning, or both.
       Euchee has two types of dependent clauses. Small clauses (non-finite
compIements) are characteristically different from the other dependent clauses
(finite complements). Causative verbs, the verb 'want' and sensory verbs require
small clause complements. The other dependent clauses include noun clauses
(complements),adjective clauses (relative clauses), and adverb clauses.","[506, 507]"

       The particle iva is the only realis particle. It conveys the meaning that a
situation is true. It can be translated as 'islwas' or 'do/did. ' It can be used
forcefully to assert the speakers certainty of the truth, and in these cases means
'sure isisure did.' Wagner (1934: 354) stated that k a is an emphatic suffix. In
contrast to the irrealis. the realis by asserting the truth is more emphatic.
However, the particle h a does much more than provide emphasis.
        As the realis mode particle, it functions as the neutral copula 'be' verb. In
other words, it 'couples' two nouns together as a sentence. The second noun
identifies the first noun. Because of this prominent role, the realis particle wa is
glossed in the interlinear text as 'cop' for copula. The copula function of h a can
be seen below.(66)   a. Neke 'wa ditsole.

'  Wagner (1934) did not state how he determined suffixes from clitics. Tense
and modes are suffixes (pp. 351-352, and pp. 353-355, respectively).
'   The consequence is that tense and mode are treated as separate from the verb
   hrase in Euchee.
'It is probable that the future nasal is n contraction of the inchoative port-clitic
 2 with the stem. This is normal contraction in Euchee (see Chapter 2, Section
4.1 Contraction). The immediate future fits semantically with the inchoative. In
addition, the tense particles are grammaticalized from auxiliary verbs of position
(Linn in prep). Sitting ci became the past imperfective j5. Standing fa became
the present, as in 'akeFB That's the way it is.' It is also used in the past
perfective jzfa. The lying 'e would fit nicely into this pattern of
grammaticalization, with '2 having the progressive and immediate future reading.

    Crawford was treating ie as an aspect suffix 'duration' (rough notes). I reject
this on the grounds of stress. Primary stress falls on the last syllable of a stem.
So, for example, the habitual aspect suffix -ne gets primary stress on verbs, and
when it acts as the norninalizer for verbs, it still gets primary stress on the end of
the noun. If le were an aspect suffix like -ne, we would expect this same
behavior, but is the last syllable, it should have primary stress. But, as stated in
the text. it is not stressed.
         In addition, the habitual -ne can be used on a11 verbs and verbal
structures. but as a verbalizer le can not be attached to existing verbs. Since
adjectives always have a verbalizer, it raises the question as to whether the
adjective is underlying a verb, and that le is durative aspect and T is progressive
aspect on the verb, However, without le or '2, adejctives can not function as a
verb. No such morphology is needed for other verbs (including stative verbs). In
addition. le cannot be added to active verbs in order to get a reading of say. 'She
 lived for a iong rime.' or 'He smoked cigarettes d~tringhis liferime.' Therefore, le
 is considered to be a cliticized verbalizer and not an aspect suffix.
         The verbalizer -lc is possibly related to direction ciitic -kc, meaning
'movement along or down a long object'. Other location clitics are used as
aspect. For exampie, on nouns -1e (a homonym with -1e 'movement along or
down a long object') is the direction 'back to,' and on verbs it is the repeated
aspect. The distant location -ke indicates heard action verbs. The meaning of
*alongan object' could be interpreted as 'a long time, over a long period of time.'
 However, this interpretation seems more likely under the 'duration' affix
 hypothesis of le, This is because it is not clear why le would get a 'verbalize'
 reading on some nouns but a 'direction' reading others. This can be explained if
adjectives are underlying different from nouns or verbs.
          The cliticization of le does raise interesting speculation into the history
and nature of suffixes in Euchee.

    Speakers read this hypothetical lengthening form as the future ~swhi:      They
(nan-Euchee)will be pitiful.'
    It is not clear why the auxiliary requires the verbalizer before the completive
de (if it is indeed the completive). Since auxiliaries are not fully verbal, it could
be that Euchee requires an active verb in order to show completion. The
verbalizer 'Z carries the present continuous aspect. A parallel is found in the
adjectives fonned with the duration -1e. These require the copula n ~ abefore they
can be put into the past tense.
7
   The extreme combination of modes is probably due to two factors. First, the
Chief does vev tittle direct speaking. The Speaker for the Chief usually speaks
for the Chief. When the Chief does speak, it is the highest level of formality
and politeness. In addition, this form is archaic and represents the fullest forms
of Euchee.
h e analysis of herzu'e is not certain. It could be the completive de, as with the
'should/ought to' re'2de (also a tentative analysis). However, since the vowel is
always reduced, the final vowel is not definitively reconstructable. The vowels
 which commonly reduce to dl! make the possibilities de, /de/, Ida/, /dB/. and /d8/.
Another possibility is that the de is not the completive, but particle of strong
potential. This would parallel the structure her2 gd 'might have to' where gd is
the potential mode.
9
    The speaker has regularized the form. The 1"" and 2"" person singuhr forms of
(8o)nd 'come' are irregular. The 1"" person form is dz6 'I come.'
 10
    According to de Haan (De Haan to appear), scholars of epistemic modality
argue that evidentials are related to doubt and certainty of the the proposition,
 but that grammars of individual languages report that speakers do not show
differing degrees of certainty with evidentials.
 "" Another possibility is that h~5is a discourse marker at the end of the
 utterances. However, it does not occur frequently in any person's speech. as one
 would suppose of a discourse marker.

1. OVERVIEW
       This chapter introduces the noun and noun phrase. This includes the basic
stems and stem formation through compounding and the nominalizer -ne
(derivation). It also includes the affixes and clitics which create a noun phrase
(inflection), such as the noun class clitics, plural clitics, possession prefixes, and
location suffixes. Following this are other modifiers which are used to extend
the noun phrase.
       There can be up to three noun phrases as participants in a Euchee
sentence: the actor, the patient, and the recipient or beneficiary. However, the
participants do not have to appear as overt noun phrases. The pronominal
agreement prefixes on the verb indicate the participants in the event or state
denoted by the verb. Therefore, if the participants in the sentence are clear from
context. the noun phrases are omitted. Context includes previous mention in the
discourse and shared world knowledge by the people engaged in rhe
conversarion, In discourse. the nouns may be reinserted for focus, emphasis, and
clarification if needed.
       Formally, it is difficult to distinguish noun s from verbs in Euchee. No
one affix is able to distinguish the two. The traditional criteria for establishing
nouns as a pan of speech separate from verbs and adjectives are difficult to
apply. This is illustrated below with some of the ways in which nouns, verbs.
adjectives. and sentences share the same morphology.
       The ability for nouns to show definiteness is one of the standard criteria
for nouns. Although there is no detinite or indefiinite article, as in the English
'the' and 'atan,' Euchee does have definite particles which are cliticized to the
noun (see 3.1 below). Yet, the definite markers are not unique to the noun
phrase. Instead, they are identical to location verb (go)nb 'be located' and
position verbs ci 'sit,' fa 'stand' and e' 'lie. Examples (1)-(2) below compare
definite nouns with simple sentences. Definite nouns can be seen in the (a)
examples, while sentences containing a location or position verb that is identical
to the definite marker on the noun are found in the (b) examples.(1)    a. dathlawen6

"        Negative warnings are formed with the negative pre-clitic on the verb.

             'You had better not leave yet!'","[324, 325]"
"
Asain. this indicates that the verbalizer is a separate word from the verb.
Finally, the verbalizer '2 can be the stem on which the negative pre-clitic can
attach, as seen in (25) below. Because of these facts, the verbalizer 9 is treated
as an independent particle which can cliticize (-2)to another stem.
       The verbalizer '2 carries the aspect suffixes for the new verb. Any
needed mode auxiliaries, mode particles, and tense can follow the verbalizer.
       The verbalizer Y can attach to nouns, as seen below.","[307, 308]"
"       These verbalized question words are often used as the main clause in
specific information questions. This causes the content verb to be an embedded
clause. Thus, questions such as 'Where did you go?' or 'What is this called?' are
literally 'Where is it that you have been?' and 'How is it that you call this thing?'
Several examples of this construction are given in (38). In (38a) the content verb
'do' in the embedded clause is in the past tense. It is marked with12 'past
imperfective', but (38b) shows that the older past imperfective sh2 used for
embedded clauses is also possible. The example in (38c) also shows that the
content verb 'eat' is embedded since it has requires the begative pre-clitic Itcr-,
which also marks negative embedded clauses.

"          The impersonal pronominal prefix go- is used to take focus away from the
actor. They de-emphasize who does something. The actor may be unknown. or
the speaker may not wish to cast blame or doubt on the actor. These are
impersonal sentences, and are best vanslated as the passive.( 1 14)   a. Go'yushe disha.

rhrases in Euchee consistently q u i r e the negative preclitic n2-.
  Because the combination c a be  ~ ~treated as a lexical unit, Wagner called all
causative constructions 'compound verbs.' I use the term 'compound verbs' to
refer to two adjecent stems creating a new word.

It is literally 'to make good teeth,' which refers to the historical practice of filing
one's teeth to achieve the aesthetic quality of pointed teeth. The analysis of the

       In contrast to ksa, the potential gfi indicates that the speaker is not
committed to the truth of the assertion. Thus, it is an irrealis mode. In English,
the potential is expressed in several ways 'might,' 'could,' 'perhaps,' 'may be,' and
even 'I guess.' These can also be expressed in the mode auxiliary I i ~ r e
'probabilily' discussed above in Section 4.3. The terns and meanings are very
similar, and both are types of imealis. However, 'potential' means that
something is not yet in existence. The potential gb usually refers to the speakers
doubts about future situations. So, 'potential' is used for the irrealis particle gii.
'Probable' means that something is likely. The probability auxiliary l ~ ~ usually

used only with adjectives. Because it is associates with adejctives, more
examples and discussion of -gi is in Chapter 7, Section 2.4
7. AUDITORY EVIDENCE:-Ke       Evidentials are markers which indicate the source of information for a
proposition. Euchee uses -ke to report an event that the speaker hears but does
not see. It is therefore an auditory eviden~ial.
       A typical use of the auditory -ke is shown in (89a). The sentence is an
assertion 'They're coming' and the evidential -ke gives the additional meaning of
'I hear them.' However, the verb cannot agree with the speaker. The same
meaning can be expressed with verb chkZ 'hear' in the main clause, as seen in
(89b). This time the speaker is the actor of 'I hear' and there is no evidential.(89)   a. 'Ahe 'ig6ke.                                 ['a he 'igq ke]

           'I hear them coming.' (women's speech)       The evidential -ke are normally not used in questions. However, the
Yes/No question in (90) is possible. However, the speaker is showing more
excitement or surprise that they are coming rather than needing information.
The position of the Yes/No question marker between the verb stem and the
auditory -kp shows the evidential is a clitic.
(90)   'Ahe 'igo 'leke?                        rahd 'ig3 like]

       here ~SG(E).PAT-COW Q-HEAR
       'Are they coming (you hear them?)' (women's speech)       Although it usually becomes a fully voiced /g/ today, the auditory -ke is
the same as the location suffix -ke, which means 'yonder' o r 'way over there.'
Like its locative meaning of 'far away,' the auditory -ke conveys the idea that the
action is so far away that it can only be heard and not seen, as in (91a-b). The
auditory -ke does not have to be used with all sound verbs, such a s 'blow' in
( 9 1 ~ ) but
          . can be attached to any non-sound verb to indicate that it was heard.","[339, 340]"
"    Although this is the probable structure, speakers treat the phrase as one word
    (indicating that 'le cliticized t~ ke). The question particle with the adverb kide
    'now' is treated here as a whole, and is glossed 'n0w.Q' for convenience.
           If kide is present, the Yes/No question prefers to attach to this adverb,
    with very few exceptions for extreme emphasis elsewhere in the question. The
Y
    Yes/No question panicle can be moved after the verb phrase, but speakers rarely
do this outside of elicited forms. The adverb and Yes/No particle keVde is
translated as 'yet' or 'now.' Examples are given in (26).(26)   a. Kelede khrenewi?

"        Some speakers use the copula h ~ aafter any verb when adding the past
tense j2. Since the past imperfective jt? is not mandatory to express the past
tense, it may be that these speakers feel that using the past tense particle is
more emphatic, for clarification or focus. The copula icla is also used as the
focus marker. Or, the reason may be historical. Since tense and global aspect
are treated as separate from the verb phrase, the language may at one time have
required a copula to cany this information.
Dependenr Clause -ShZ
       The past imperfective in a dependent clause is sht. The form helped
mark a dependent clause, but it is not used regularly today. Some speakers still
prefer it, some can use it interchangeably with the imperfective j2 used in
independent clauses, and others are not familiar with its usage. Several
examples follow with the dependent clause underlined.

"Upon finding this note I was immediately relieved to know that I was nor the
only one with these problems, but frustrated by the problems that none seemed to
have overcome.
       More recently there has been renewed interest in Euchee for historical
and comparative purposes. Dale Nicklas re-examined the pronominal classes
(Nicklas 1994). He took a phonological approach to the history of the
pronominal classes instead of the classificatory approach proposed by Ballard.
Nicklas worked on data from Wagner (1930; 1934). And recently, Roben Rankin
(1996, 1997) has reopened investigation into the senetic affiliation of Euchee and
Siouan using Wagner (1934) and Ballard (1973; 1978).
       In summary, although quality data exist on Euchee in manuscript and
notebook form, previous research has not produced a full documentation of any
Icvel of the grammar. and there has been no significant work on the syntax.
Most allention has been paid to the genetic classification of the language. but
this, too, has been limited by insufficient grammatical data.
4. COALSAND CHARA(XERISTICS
                        OF THIS GRAMMAR
       This is the first comprehensive grammar of the Euchee language. I have
tried to include all family and dialect variations whenever possible, but some
unintentional oversights are inevitable in such a work. All languages are
complex and changing, and so there will always be a need for more work into
the subtleties and richness of the Euchee language. It is my hope that this
grammar can be a starting point from which more work on the phonology, syntax.
and pragmatics of the language can be explored.
       The extensive coverage of aspects of the language in this grammar is due
to several factors. First, I have been able to compare my findings and draw on
the work of all those before me. The work of Gatschet, Wagner. Ballard, and
Cnwford have been particularly invaluable to me in this endeavor. Second. I
have tried whenever possible to include not only what is possible in :he
language. but also what is not possible in the language. This has meant untold
hours of grammatical elicitation, and much patience and expertise on the part of
the speakers. It has created some humorous times as well. When testing the
limits of certain morphemes, speakers have laughingly admonished me. 'That is
just plain bad Euchee!' Which of course is what I wanted to know. In addition
to the direct elicitation of forms. I have relied heavily on data from texts. I have
endeavored to use both historical and contemporary textual information. and both
formal and informal narrative styles. Some of these texts are found in Appendix
1.
       Most importantly, I have had continuous interaction with the speakers uf
Euchee for six years. This continuity has given me a depth and breadth into the
language and its use. I have not only been allowed into the Euchee community.
but blessed with the generosity of the people. Many families have lent me their
personal family recordings. Mrs. Phoebe Bucktrot Jones let me use recordings of
her father, the late Chief Madison Bucktrot; Mrs. Sarah Skeeter McNac let me
use a recording of her mother, the late Mrs. Sadie Green Skeeter with ner
mother; The Euchee (Yuchi) Tribe of Indian, Inc. and the family of the late Chief
Jim Brown, Sr., graciously allowed me access to a video tape of Chief Brown;
and Mr. Gregory Bigler has generously let me use hours of video taped
storytelling, along with extensive use of the materials collected by the Euchee
Class of Sapulpa. In addition, Ballard's recordings and transcriptions
substantially increased my base of recorded Euchee speakers, and I have enjoyed
many hours with current speakers reviewing these tapes, as it has brought back
memories for them to hear these voices again.
       I have been fortunate to work with speakers, both male and female. and
their families from all three Euchee geographical areas. This has enabled me to
have a better understanding of the variations that occur within the language. I
had the opportunity to work with the late Mrs. Louanna Bamett, the late Mrs.
Mae Tulsa, and the late Mr. Dimmie Washburn. I have gained many insights
from Mr. Gregory Bigler and Mr. Richard Grounds, who are actively learning the
language. I owe my understanding of the Euchee language to the dedication of
those that have worked closely with me over these years: Mrs. Josephine Wildcat
Bigler, Mrs. Maxine Wildcat Barnett, Mrs. Maggie Cumsey Marsey. Mrs. Martha
Fox Squire, Mrs. Josephine Bamctt Keith. and Mr. Mose Cahwee. I could not
have begun this project without the guidance of the very talented and eloquent
speaker. the late Mr. William Cahwee. His gifts as a natural linguist, and his
willingness to help others, were extraordinary. Finally. Mr. Henry Washbum has
been a most dedicated teacher. His keen ability to son out the impossible and
his patience, often stopping to 'kick that around,' made it possible for me to finish
this work.
       There may be skeptics who do not believe that there could be
fluent speakers of Euchee at the end of the twentieth century. However, I
must stress that not only are all the speakers superb speakers of the
Euchee language, they do not vary significantly either lexically or
-grammatically from monolingual speakers recorded by Gatschet in 1885,
Wagner in 1928-9, or the monolingual and bilingual speakers recorded in
the 1970's Crawford and Baltard. In fact, upon seeing Gatschet's field
notes for the first time, I was struck by how similar his entries are to
mine: I could easily read his entries and found forms in his that I had not
found any other descriptions about in the language."" Ridge's 1826
vocabulary shows inflectional morphemes not published by Wagner, but
certainly appear in my work (and a few were being noted by Cnwford as
well). Additionally, the language has not bee affected by neighboring
languages. There has been remarkably very little borrowing of English
words. nor of Muscogee or Shawnee, the Euchee preferring to create their
own words instead.
       There are some phonological shifts as are noted in Chapter 2, but
even these are remarkably small for the intense contact with English since
allotment in 1895 and Oklahoma statehood in 1907. There is also some
loss in the honorific and familial classification system, which are
commonly susceptible to cultural and language shift. However, it should
be noted that even these changes occur almost solely in the speech of
men. implying that Euchee women are more conservative in their speech
than Euchee men. This phenomenon is well documented in other
languages throughout the world.
       It is my hope that this grammar will be used within as well as
outside of the Euchee community. Since Euchee is not like any other
language spoken today, there is ample data here for testing linguistic
theories for many years to come. In addition, a better understanding of
Euchee can aid in typological studies of the languages of the Americas
and of all human language. And again, perhaps a more complete
grammar can shed light on the history of the Euchee people. In addition
to these. it is my sincere hope hat the Euchee people will be able to use
the grammar in the preparation of language dass materials. I hope adult
language learners can use it as a resource, and all Euchee can pick it up
and feel pride in their heritage language.
       The aim to serve the needs of two distinct communities has made
the presentation of this grammar a hybrid. I have followed the descriptive
tradition as closely as possible. In this way, the data can be useful to
linguists working in any theoretical persuasion. It is not, however, strictly
in keeping with formal descriptive grammars. In attempting to make the
grammar accessible to the members of the Euchee Tribe, I have chosen to
use t e n s more likely to be found in a teaching grammar. Linguistic
terminology is placed in parentheses. I have also found the traditional
categories unwieldy for describing Euchee. The separate designations
'morphology' and 'syntax' simply do not work. and so I have organized the
grammar by building words (derivational morphology) into phrases
(inflectional morphology and syntax) and then into clauses (syntax). It is
my hope that this grammar will aid the trained linguist, the Euchee
language teachers, and the interested lay reader in understanding how the
Euchee language works.","[46, 47, 48, 49, 50]"

Perception Verbs
       Perception verbs also require a small clause in Euchee. Perception verbs
include (golchive 'hear,' (go)'n2 'see,' and (gojha, 'smell.' Examples are in (83).(83)   a. Williams'en6 s'e'yagwa doch'wa: je

       Complement clauses (finite clauses) are embedded clauses that are much
less dependent than the small clauses. The verb in the complement clause can
have its own aspect, tense and mode. In addition, the pronominal agreement is
not dependent on the main clause. As such, they can stand alone as a sentence.
       However, complement clauses have markers that flag them as dependent
clauses. These are subordinators. There are two (non-aspect) subordinators.
The sitting noun class ci marks subordinate clauses where the actor or the patient
of a stative verb is singular. The plural inanimate ha is used when the actors or
patients of a staive verb are plural. These are translated as 'that.' In addition,
dependent clauses are marked with the dependent past imperfective tense shZ
and the dpendent negative pre-clitic ha-. A dependent clause, in the second line
of the gloss, is shown below with all of its dependent markers.","[516, 517]"

5. MODEPARTICLES:
               REALISAND IRREALIS       Euchee has a set of mode particles which express the speakers beliefs
about what is real (irrealis) and what is unreal (the irrealis). There is one realis
particle in Euchee. The particle 'wa expresses certainty that a situation has
occurred, is knowable, or is true. There are several irrealis panicles. Most are
concerned with future action. Since the future has not happened yet, it is
'unreal.' They express the potential g6, expectation La, intention n6. In addition,
the Yes/No question particle is an irrealis particle in Euchee: If one questions the
situation the truth, it is not yet real to the questioner.
       All of the irrealis mode particles are verbalizers. They can follow nouns,
adjectives, and quantifiers in order to give them a verbal reading. This function
is introduced in each of the following sections. However, the process is treated
as a whole in Chapter 7: Other Verbal Structures.
       The realis/irrealis mode particles follow the verb or the mode auxiliaries.
When the mode particles are combined with the mode auxiliaries, they tend to
loose stress and become attached. However, when they function as the
verbalizer for nouns and adjectives, they have stress and are independent
particles.","[326, 327]"
"       When used in complete sentences and clauses, the postpositions generally
occur with one of the general location/direction suffixes and are independent
particles. However, when a postposition phrase is given by itself, they can be
independent word, and therefore stressed. Or, they can be unstressed and
cliticize to the noun. However, the end of the noun gets primary stress, so the
difference is a matter of emphasis by the speaker. Some phrases tend to always
be cliticized, as are the examples in (126).                                    'over his head'
                                    'on his feet'
                                    'under his feet'
       Adjectives and quantifiers, such as 'many' or 'few' are verbal structures.
The follow the noun that they modify. However, they are always clauses.
Adjectives and quantifiers are found in Chapter 7: Verbal Structures.
       Adjective and quantifiers are dependent clauses. As such they must have
a dependent clause marker. These are the noun class and plural post-clitics.
                                   r-- 8.
Depe9dem t!suses are treated in Chanter
       A few adjectives can appear non-verbal after a noun. These are
restricted to common adjectives such as h 'big' and s'i 'small' and a few others.
When these occur, the noun class or plural follows the adjective. These
structures are most likely on their way to being compounds. A few examples
follow. The second in each pair is the verbal adjective with the active verbalizer
-5 or the stative verbalizer -1e.(127) a. 'yd fi                         'a shining star'
              'yd   frm                 'a shining starme star is shining.'       b. 'ya 'a?                       'a big tree'
              ya 'zle                   'a big treeme tree is big.'       c. shu s'i                       'a little fish'
          shus'i                        'a minnow'       Euchee can have recursive adjectival modification, although speakers
prefer to have no more than two adjectives in a phrase. If the string contains a
color term, the color term will always be the closest to the noun; numerals are
always last. The noun class/deteminer post-clitic attaches to the end of the noun
phrase.(128) a. hostane 'yakiicj                                 'the white box'
         hostane 'yak2 hohb'Ecj                           'the empty white box'
         hostane 'yak8 'aele hohf 'Ecj                    'the big empty white box'          b. k'asothl'ine titiha                          'yellow pencils'
             k'asothl'ine titi hinegiiha                  'new yellow pencils'
             k'asothl'ine titi hinegiiha nbwii            'two new yellow pencils'As can be seen above, the noun class/determiner post-clitic or the plural post-
clitic follows the noun and its adjectivets). Although it follows the last modifier.
the numarals are outside of the noun phrase. 14 They may have once been verbal
structures.
' The word for blujay ts'e is probably onomatopoeic.
   The meaning 'human' is for the most part 'Euchee,' although the meaning has
expanded in recent times. Gatschet recorded it as explicitly Euchee, but
speakers today insist on gor'e being all humans, not just Euchees. The possessive
pronominal we- versus go- on body parts definitely divides Euchee body parts
from non-Euchee human body parts, and the pronorninals we- versus go- in
deverbal nouns also distinguish Euchee from non-Euchee human activities.
There is no word *wet2 meaning non-Euchee human, implying that hurnaness
was restricted to Euchees. This is not an uncommon separation in languages.
On the other hand, the human marker is used to describe non-Euchees for the
names of races and some other Tribes:(i)    gotsyathla     human-red             'Native Americans'
       go'ispi        human-black           'African, African-Americans'
       go'yaka        human-white           'Caucasians'
       WP'~                                 'Creek'  This is the expected order in an APV (SOV)language. However, the head in
the left position runs contrary (Williams and DiSciullo 1987), who argued that
compound heads are universally the right stem. On a descriptive level, this is
not upheld with quick perusal of grammars of most Native (SOV)languages.
However. Williams and DiSciullo argue on theoretical grounds that the heads of
all words are the right-most element, including derivational suffixes. Thus, the
nominalizer (derivation) could be the head in Euchee. The nominalizer -ne is the
same as the habitual aspect -ne on verbs (inflection). Noun and verb stems, as
argued in the text, have little distinction. If they are indeed simply [+stem]
underlyingly, and not specified for noun or verb, then the -ne is for all stems.
The habitual suffix gives the verb a non-event reading, and non-events can be
used in the syntax a s norninals. Although the habitual is integrated more fully
into the noun stem (it gets the primary stress for the noun) than on the noun (it is
unstressed), it is still an inflectional affix. Thus, the heads in Euchee can still be
argued to be the left stem, contrary to the universal right-head hypothesis.
4
   The word 'sword' jGfhl'igZ is no longer attested by speakers, They agree that
this is a probable word for 'sword', but they have never heard the word used
before. However, assuming that they would use this word for 'sword', they agree
with the analysis differing 'sword' from 'a long knife'.
  Wagner (1934: 317-18)also considered all two syllable stems to be compounds.
He presented the bisyllabic compounds in three categories, combining the degree
of interpretability of the head and modifying stem:(ii)    Wagner's Bisyllabic Compound Categories
        Noun+Adjective                   both independent words
        Noun+SpecifyingElement           independent + bound and obscure
        Theme Element+SpecifyingElement both bound and obscureWagner's first two fall under my first group, and his last falls into my third group.
The problem with Wagner's presentation is his wording and the amount of data
that he gave to support these categories. The term 'theme element' is
misleading; it sounds as if the first syllable were a classificatory morpheme.
However, the first syllables are not classificatory morphemes, they are the heads
of the compounds. Then, Wagner gave only a few examples of each of his
categories and made no comments on the productivity of the stems as compound
heads. He did not show the relationship of the arguably older bisyllabic
compounds to noun modification and compounding in the language
   Rankin uses only heads we, go, and da as an ancient classificatory system. He
compares these with phonetically and semantically similar classification
morphemes in Proto-Siouan. The resemblance between these morphemes are
striking and deserve continued attention, but the grammatical basis for their
comparision-a classification system-is tenable.
'  The word for 'face' is commonly given with the noun class post-clitic -ci today.
This is clearly the noun class post-clitic, however, and not a modifier as the
pssessive forms shoe: didaci 'my face' and 'odaha 'our faces.'
   There is a good possiblity that the stem of these nouns comes from the
adjective ts6ldzci (today d f i or hidz9) meaning 'greenblue.'
9
  It is easy to confuse words which are formed with the we- as part of the stem
and those which are we- given with the animate non-Euchee possessive prefix.
 Each must be tested by eliciting other possessive forms of the word. By this
 method I have eliminate some words commonly found in comparative literature
 as including we- as pan of the stem. A few of these are given examples below
 so that the status of we- as the possessive prefix can be seen. The classifier or
 plural is given in parentheses:(iii)   sh'i          'bone'
        wesh'i'ha     'Its/His bones (non-Euchee) I/ animal bones'
        gosh'i'ha     'someone's bones//human bones'
        dish'iha      'my bones'
        gosha         'louse, lice'
        wesna         'his (nun-Eucheej iicz; He ilas iice.'
       di dzyogosha          'my lice'lo   'Big House' is a figurative usage for the clean ground or ceremonial ground.
I ' Crawford consistently records the nasal variation -nZ in his field notes with
Mrs. Nancy Wildcat. However, the -ne and -nZ occur in free variation with
speakers today, with a propensity towards the non-nasal variation. This is
expected as there is denasalization at the end of words and phrases (see Chapter
2). Nasalization of this morpheme was not recorded before Crawford.
'? This reconstruction was given by Mr. William Cahwee.
l 3 The word for 'cow' is most probably derived from wedi 'buffalo' and the -ne
diminutive. Today, speakers are not able to assign meaning to wedi by itself.
However, Gatschet recorded it alone meaning 'buffalo' (1885) The modem term
for buffalo, then, has been lexicalized from wedi and ga 'old man'.
14
     This is expected if all independent noun phrases are adjuncts, as proposed by
both Jelinek (1983) and Baker (1996) for polysynthetic languages.
l 5 For some speakers who are not as fluent socially, the inanimate classes have
merged into one definite morpheme, similar to the English 'the.' The default
class -ci 'sitting' is the definite morpheme.
l6 There is also some question of several families in Georgia who claim Euchee
heritage as well. One speaker, who told of meeting one of these extended
families, did not use the Euchee class with them. I do not know if this is
because they were outwardly more clearly of African descent than of Euchee
descent and thus did not seem Euchee to this speaker, or because there were no
clear family ties.
    In his 'Some Grammatic Elements of the Yuchi Language,' Gatschet (1905) re-
worded 'not related' to read 'not of the same totem.' Although some Euchee
elders refer to clans, many others do not remember a clan system growing up.
Instead, they refer to a person's lineage association through their kir, [he tribal
town or stomp ground.
''  Gon ';iskPweno is also the word for 'picture' and 'photo'. With this meaning, it
always takes the inanimate noun class post-clitic -ci.
 19
     Gatschet and Wagner recorded the word for' Creek*as gopa. Gatschet's
consultant, Mr. David Bamett, gives the translation as 'people burner*from when
the Euchees were at war with the Creeks. This is a plausible etymoloy, with go-
p l being 'human-bum.' However, I (as did Crawford) get a clearly glottalized
gop'a for 'Creek'. Mr. Henry Washburn stated that his mother thought it was
because [he Creeks stare at people. In this case, the etymology would be go-p'a
'human-look at.'
'O The Euchee have been friends with the Shawnee since before removal. See
Jackson (1998) for details of this ongoing relationship. This variation of the word
'Shawnee' translates as 'little Shawnee'. It does not refer to the current split in
the Absentee Shawnee Tribe between North and South Little Axe Ceremonial
Ground. Speakers do not think that the two words refer to the different Shawnee
Tribes in Oklahoma, the Absentee, the Loyal and the Eastern Bands. Thus, it
may have referred to pre-removal relationships.
*'   One of my female consultants reports that the possessive do- series is used
mainly in men's speech for family terms. However, Wagner gives the opposite.
 He gives the do- set is used mainly in women's speech. The speaker today is
 from Polecat area, and Wagner worked mainly with speakers from Sand Creek
and Big Pond areas. The speakers today from Big Pond Dialect do not use the
do- for men's speech. So, the difference could be one of dialect variation.
""   It was impossible to elicit a clearly definite 'the Tuesday' without the meaning
'on*because phrases such as 'the Tuesday before last' or 'the Tuesday when
Richard was here' still contain the meaning 'on the Tuesday.'
23 Both Gatschet and Speck recorded the demonstrative pronouns as the only
independent pronouns.
""   This is contrary to what I have proposed earlier. b Linn (1996) I asserted that
the classifiers (and plural) morphemes must be the left-most constituent in a
definite noun phrase.

       Verbs have been treated extensively throughout this work. This chapter
looks at other parts of speech which can be made into verbs. The process is
quite productive in Euchee. Most parts of speech can be interpreted as a verb
simply by adding a verbalizer (active and stative aspect), tense, or mode particle.
This underscores the notion that stems are not marked for category but are
interpreted as a noun or a verb in the syntax. If a stem is followed by verbal
inflection, then it is a verb.
       This chapter covers verbal nouns (predicate nominals), verbal adjectives
(predicate adjectives), quantifiers, and location and position constructions.","[429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436]"

Exceptional 'le Position: Tense and Mode
       The Yes/No question particle can never be placed after the tense or mode
phrase. The questions in (14) are repeated in (28) below, with the addition of
the ungrammatical placement word finally after a tense or mode phrase.(28)   a. S'eyo'aene & je?
          s'e-yo-'me                                      je

Changing 'ie Posirion: Focus       When Ye is not in the 2ndposition, it changes the focus of the question
from the whole sentence to the phrase that it is immediatley following. The
difference can be seen in the meeting questioned in (29) below. Tuesday is the
usual meeting day for this group. In (29a) the question is sentence-level scope.
The question particle comes after the verb phrase and the verb 'see each other' is
in question. However, in (29b) the verb is 'meet', but question does not focus on
whether or not they will meet. Rather, the question panicle comes after the
noun phrase 'Monday' because it is different from the usual. So, 'Monday' is the
focus of the question in (29b).

"       Despite the consistency of height on morphemes, and their resistance to
other phonological rules, some instances of height in BPD leave open the
possibility that, a t least a t o n e time, the raising in BPD was not morpheme bound
but a product of a more general heightening rule or vowel harmony. For
example, some BPD speakers will pronounce kede 'now' a s [kedi], but the spatial
morpheme -de will not be [-di] in other occurrences. Additionally, in a few
cases. it word final vowel will be heightened, such a s (46) above. where the verb
I s k ' irne is pronounced Lgni] by BP speakers.""   A possibility still remains that
the BPD 2ndperson singular pronominal prefix ni- and the 3rd person non-Euchee
pronominal wi- are the result of regressive vowel harmony. Unlike the suffixes.
and the location root ni, it is not mandatory that the 2nd person and 3rd person
non-Euchee pronominals be high before non-high vowels. Although examples of
these heightened pronominals exist in environments which could not produce
harmony to height, the majority are before high vowels.
       In addition to vowel height. BPD is actor to several other phonological
differences. The palatalization rule given in (18) above is active only in BPD.
and the word final /e/ laxing, given in (25) above is less prominent.
I
   The similarity between the Euchee phoneme inventory and those of the Siouan
languages. especially those of the Dakota branch, is probably what lead Sapir to
hypothesize a Euchee-Siouan relationship. Siouan stops contrast by aspiration
(plain and aspirated) and glottalization, although not always by voicing (arguably
a newer innovation in Euchee). However, the Ohio Valley (Southeastern) Siouan
languages, neighbors to the Euchee, had collapsed the glottalized series creating
smaller inventories. Like Euchee, Dakota Siouan languages have a full set of
fricatives, but there are two /m, n/ to three /IJ/ nasal stop phonemes where
Euchee has only one nasal stop phoneme /n/. Siouan languages tend to have 5-
vowel systems. with 3 or more nasal vowels, all contrasting by length. Euchee
shows no phonemic contrast by length (see Sections 1.4 A Note on Vowel Length
and 3.2 Vowel Lengthening in Emphatic, Comparative, and Superlative
Structures).
'  In this case, the 'human' morpheme is the bound root. see Chapter 5 . Section I.
Noun Roots. The 'human' morpheme may also occur as a pronominal prefix
Gatschet ( 1885) recorded the 3' person impersonal pronominal prefix as
voiceless unaspirated [ku-1. ,In addition, Gatschet gave the ISG'person singular
pronominal prefix as [ti-] (actor) and [tse-] (patient). Today these morphemes are
voiced [go-]. [di-] and [dze], although this is due to their initial position (see
discussion in the text). However, the bound root go- meaning 'human' is always
fully voiced.
'  The verb k B 'to make, to do' is often produced [go] or [gal in noun compounds.
As a verb, it retains its ejective and nasal [k'q].

   These allophones of /f/ suggest that the modem If/ is recent in the language. It
may have arisen from an earlier *hw or *xw. as did the /f/ in Muskogean. If this
is the case, it could confirm borrowing from Muskogean Nick!as (1994b).
'  Wagner (1934: 305) stated that the epenthetic [n] occurred only before the
pulmonic dental stops. I have found them before any non-biiabial and non-velar
consonant. Wagner (305) also did not find epenthetic nasals before electives. but
 I have found no such restriction.
6
   The velar fricative [x] was described by Wagner (1934: 306) as occumng
""whenever an open or closed unnasalized vowel is followed by a dental or
alveolar stop (d, T, t ) or by a palatal stop (g, K, k)."" (Wagner's notation for the
unaspirated stops is [T] and [K].) Wagner marked [x] (voiceless dorsal-palatal
friiaiivsj oi [&j (voiielcs~vclar fricative) consistently in these snvironmenis
throughout the Yrrchi Tales (1930). Wagner did not describe them in word final
position. From the unpublished notes in phonetic transcription of both Crawford
and Ballard, it is apparent that neither linguist were recording an occurrence of
[x] or [XI.Crawford did mjke a handwritten note in an unpublished phonology
manuscript about the pre-aspiration of some aspirated stops. However, aspirated
stops are the one stop environment that Wagner did not find [x] in.
'   The epenthetic [x] and [h] are more pronounced in some speakers than others.
and they are overall more clear and consistent in female speakers. Wagner
consistently recorded [x] in male speakers as well as female. Therefore, I am
assuming that their prevalence in women's speech today is due to the women
being generally more conservative speakers than the men, and not that it was
pn      of the difference between men's and women's speech styles.
    Crawford (1973) used the symbols [El for the mean-mid front vowel of the lax
oral vowel to distinguish it from the [E] lower-mid front vowel of the lax nasal
vowel.
    Wagner (1934: 371) recorded an [o], or [&pol6], not an /ul or [u].
 loIn a few roots, the underlying vowel phoneme has been lost. Whenever this is
the case, I use the orthographic 'v', used for [D]in contractions and /Q/, as it most
often occur centralized, and [A]in the morphemic representations.
 ' I It is telling that speakers who write in Euchee are diligent in indicating nasal
vowels but never attempt to distinguish length. In addition. when the Euchee
Language Class of Sapulpa was meeting regularly (attended by most of the
 fluent speakers), they would often have discussions about vowel qualities such as
nasality and laxing, such as whether to write [el or [ E ] . However. I never heard
a discussion as to the length of a vowel.
 I' This is fundamentally the same analysis as Crawford. which he gave as
C(C)V(:).
l3  For one speaker, contrxtion is not optional with the animate non-Euchee
classifier. For this speaker, the contracted form marks the singular definite and
the uncontracted form with the penultimate stress marks the plural of all animate
non-Euchee nouns.
IJ
   An alternative hypothesis is that the deletion applies to the onset only and the
features of the deleted onset and the remaining vowel assimilate. For descriptive
purposes, the syllable deletion view is maintained.
        The contraction process in Euchee can accounted for quite elegantly with
feature geometry (Linn 1995). The following is an example, using a deleted we-
3rd singular actor, non-Euchee, pronominal agreement prefix. The we morpheme
is contracted, and the features [+round]and [+back]from the [w] spread left to
the preceding vowel. This accounts for the regular backing and rounding of the
preceding vowels in ule contractions.

and Ballard (1975: 166), and minimally by Crawford (1973: 176). Both Wagner
and Ballard listed the changes associated with the contraction of the non-Euchee

immediately preceding the deleted rve morpheme. Their changes are reproduced

    In this section on contraction, all of the examples from hames Crawford (JC)
are pulled from an unpublished manuscript entitled 'Yuchi' and his notes for this
manuscript. The examples are from his notebooks of text and direct elicitation of
 forms with Mrs. Nancy Wildcat. The manuscript appears to have been for his
class on the Euchee at Georgia State University.

    One speaker does contract the 3"" person singular pronominal /he-/ to /h~-1.
 19
    The vowel shifts for the ho- and hi- contraction look the same as in we-
contraction, with the exception of the diphthong [ao] produced with assimilation
 to /a/. The diphthong [ao] is the sole evidence for the [+round]feature of the /w/
 to spread left. Otherwise, like the /h/ deletion, the roundness is due to the fact
 that all back vowels in Euchee are round.
O' Both [gdspi] 'black person' and [gaka] 'white person' are commonly used with
 all Euchee. even those who do not speak the Euchee language.
 'I This example is from Sadie Skeeter, who was from Duck Creek. Thus. this is
 not an instance of the Big Pond Dialect dialect variation /wid instead of we-.
 "" Rankin (1997; from Ballard (1974:17) gives a set not listed here: side 'naked'
 and sllitle 'bald. bare.' I have checked this with three speakers (representing
 both dialects and both genders). All of them use only one side for both
 meanings, and none have heard shirle. Since some speakers palatalize Is/ before
 a high vowel (see Section 1.2 of this chapter) is probable that difference here is
 due to the phonological palatization rule, not lexicalization.
''   This is apparently the same conclusion that Crawford (1980) was reaching.
 What is interesting is that even though Euchee is not as synthetic as many of the
  languages of the Americas, it still behaves like a polysynthetic language. in the
 sense of Baker (1996). This includes the mandator): pronominal agreement, freer
  word order, and discontuous constituents. Other characterstics are noted
  throughout this work. it shouid be noted that although the ianguage is not tigntiy
 bound together, the process of cliticization is productive. Its relationship to stress
and the continuum with affixation need funher attention.
""    Speakers today cannot analyze this morpheme in the word for 'tax.' However,
 Wagner (ca. 1935) gives the word for 'tax' as [tapihotigokSnC]. In his example,
 the first morpheme [tapi] appears to be 'salt.' I am assuming his earlier
 transcription as [thlebi] is a possible compti onAs salt has always been a valued
 resource in human societies, it is possible that the word refers to payment by or
 for salt. As this idea became obsolete, the language appears to have added sh
 'land' (and in some variations jk'alal 'thing') without having dropped the 'salt.'
 ?-F Many of the locatives are derived from nouns. For example, sk is the
 'ground/earrh' as well as 'down' and /ta/ is 'face' as well as 'on.' This can be one
 reason for their independent status and behavior with the location suffixes.
 26 Gatschet recorded only two Panicle + Verb Constructions, and he wrote the
 panicle separate from the verb (1885: 38). Speck (ca. 1904-1923) discusses
 'general' locatives [locative particles] as separate panicles (p. 41), but then he
 writes them on the verb or almost attached. This was a device he used 'when
 the connection is close' (p. 40). He later gives four 'specialized' locatives as
 'nearer to being verbal prefixes' (p. 48). The difference between hi 'general' and
 'specialized' locatives is not clear, and is not the same has my distinction
 between the generalized location/direction suffixes and the locative particles.
          Wagner, roo, had trouble determining the status of the locative particles.
 The locative panicles were treated as noun suffixes in his 1930 publication. and
  then changed to verb prefixes in the grammatical sketch (1934: 358). Neither
  Ballard nor Crawford discuss the locative particles, but in their field notes they
  are treated as attached to the verb and presumably treated as verb prefixes
  (Ballard ca. 1972-75; Crawford 1972-1973).
7' Since verbs are inflected for person and can be full clauses. technically the
  negative preclitic is also a clause-level clitic. ow eve-(, for the purposes of
  description of Euchee, it is more convenient to group the negative preclitic with
  the other phrase-level clitics.
  28
     This could be argued to be a case of overgeneralization to the habitual
  morpheme [-nil.

                       --Ellen Allen (Euchee), Letter to Frank Speck
                       June 1, 1947
       Pronouns 'I,' 'you' 'he/she/it' and so on may be separate words (called
independent pronouns) or they may be attached to a verb or noun (called
pronominal affixes). In Euchee. the pronominals are required even when the
core particpants are indicated by an independenc noun phrase. Thus. pronominals
cross-reference, or agree with, the noun.
       Euchee has a rich system of pronominal agreement on the verb. The
pronominals are prefixed to the verb stem. Each verb must be cross-referenced
for each of the participants in the clause. Because of this, the participants may
not be stated in independent noun phrases. Instead, the verb and its pronominal
agreement are a complete sentence. In fact, after the first reference. or when
the participants are otherwise known to the hearer, speakers do not use
independent noun phrases.
       The role of the participants in a sentence is not marked on nouns in
Euchee. Instead, the pronominal prefixes reflect these roles. There are two sets
of pronominal prefixes distinguished by role: The actor set and the patient set.
The choice of pronominal set is determined by the inherent aspect of the verb.
The actor set is used for all event verbs, and the patient set is used for all verbs
showing n state. Therefore, the Euchee pronominal prefixes reflect a stative-
active system.
       The agreement system also interacts with a prefix which changes the
number of participants in the clause (valence). An historical valence prefix,
presumably *yo-, adds one participant to an event: a one-place (transitive) verb
is changed to a two-place (transitive) verb, and a two-place verb into a three-
place (ditransitive) verb. The valence prefix comes between the verb stem and
the pronominals. In this position, both actor and patient pronominal forms have
contracted with the [+participant]prefix *yo-, and they can not be un-contracted
today. This lexicalized contraction is what has created the abundance of
pronominal forms, or what Wagner (and subsequent linguists) called the four
'series' of pronominals.
       Throughout this work, the pronominal sets are referred to with the 1""
person singular forms di- actor set, dze- patient set, do- actor + participant set
and dzo- - dzyo- patient + participant set, instead of Wagner's terms Series I.
Series 11, etc ... The reason for this is pedagogical: The 1"" person pronominal
gives learners a more direct coirespondence with the set, and the 1"" person
singular is the only pronominal form which can tell a learner which set is in
           '
operation. The meaning of verbs can help rt learner predict which set of
pronouns to use, but there are many exceptions to the pattern. So, learners are
encouraged to elicit the 1"" person singular form when working with a speaker.
This is also the reason that examples throughout this work are given in the I""
person singular form-not    to encourage egocentrism, but to encourage accuracy
and ease in learning.
       Finally, the 3rd person pronimal prefixes show complexity due to the noun
classes. Since every verb must be cross-referenced with the independent nouns.
and since every noun in Euchee has a noun class, the pronominals must agree
with the class of the noun. The noun classes are seen in the 3rd person, when
referring to other people, living beings, places, things. or concepts. In addition.
the noun class morphemes have variations according to the sex of the speaker.
These variations (called honorifics) also affect the form of the pronominal
agreement. With noun class and honorifics, there are eight possible 3d person
singular pronominals. The 3d person pronominal agreement is introduced below,
but a full description of the noun class system and how it interacts with levels of
formality is found in Chapter 6, Section 3.2.","[131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143]"

       Information (or content) questions are questions in which the response
contains information beyond 'yes' or 'no.' Information questions contain a
question word (interrogative pronoun). The question words not only signal that
the clause is a question, but they indicate what kind of information is being
asked. With the exception of w i k 'what,'
                                   ~       all the question words are formed with
the question stem wa. The question word has rising pitch (indicated with a [;I),
but the end of question has falling intonation. With only a few exceptions, the
rising pitch is on the second syllable of the information word. The list of
question words is in (34).(34)   wan6                         'who'

       The Euchee language is not demonstrably related to any known
language. Thus, Euchee is classified genetically as an isolate language.
However. there is continuing debate over its possible affiliation with the
Siown language family. Sapir ( 1921) proposed the genetic connection
between Euchee and the Siouan language family. Although he did not
give any evidence for this classification, it has stuck with Euchee as a
classification to either prove or disprove. Few linguists have gone beyond
this in search for other possible relationships.
       Haas (1951). in her pursuit of a larger Gulf family, investigated
Sapir's Siouan-Yuchi classification, but did not find adequate evidence to
support the claim. Haas (1951; 1964) also suggested ties with Proto-
Athabaskan, through its connection to Siouan, but dropped this as well. In
both cases, she limited her work to phonological comparisons of cognate
sets. Elmendorf (1963. 1964) began research into a possible connection
with the Yukian family (using Yuki and Wappo data) in California. Once
again, the link relied on the connection between Siouan and Euchee.
Elmendorf also looked at lexical resemblances, and then used what he
called 'item sets.' which were morphemes with broad phonological and
semantic similarities. In the end Elmendorf made no firm commitment to
any Yuchi-Yukian relationship. More recently Rankin (1996; 1997) has
renewed the interest in proving the Siouan-Yuchi hypothesis, this time
searching for grammatical evidence between Euchee and improved Proto-
Siouan data. The search in this direction continues to yield interesting
information into shared history, whether the shared history is genetic or
sheds light on the nature of contact between two unrelated peoples.
However. no hypothesis has generated sufficient data to place Euchee
firmly into any language family (Crawford 1979; Linn 1997a). and the
question of the classification of the Euchee language is far from being
resof ved.
       To give an idea of the time depth for genetic relatedness of Euchee to
any other language family, we can look at the time depth of the Siouan language
family and its proposed relationship to Euchee. Proto-Siounn is estimated to be
24,000 years from the present. This means that 2-4.000 years ago, all the tribes
comprising the Siouan language family were together speaking one common
language--the proto-language, or the predecessor language. The demonstrated
Catawban branch is distantly related to Proto-Siouan at a time depth significantly
previous to this 4,000 years (Rankin to appear). If Euchee is related to Proto-
Siouan-Catawban, then the relationship must predate the Catawban split by a
time depth great enough to obscure its obvious relationship to Proto-Siouan.
Thus. we are looking at a time depth of at least 8.000 to 10,000 years for a
possible relationship to Proto-Siouan-Cntawban. and probably an equal amount
for any other potential relationship.
        With only very deep genetic relationships possible, there will never be an
abundance of evidence, and it is clear that evidence of deep genetic relationship
can nor come only from phonology and cognate sets but must also rely on
morphological and syntactic evidence. One of the goals of this grammar is to
provide a thorough Euchee description that can aid comparative linguists in
teasing out shared grammatical paradigms. Hopefully, Sapir's Siouan-Yuchi
connection can be firmly established or be safely put aside so that comparative
linguists can look for other connections.
       The Euchee language shows variations due to region and gender.
There are also formal and informal registers. These are noted throughout
the grammar, but are introduced briefly here.
       Two regional dialects are spoken today, and there is some
evidence to suggest that a third existed during the nineteenth century in
Oklahoma. One dialect corresponds directly to the Big Pond Town. This
Tribal Town was the farthest west of the Euchee townsJceremonial
grounds, around present day Depew. Big Pond ceased to be an active
ceremonial ground in the first decade of the 20Ihcentury. Most of the Big
Pond people became part of the Sand Creek Ceremonial Ground. Thus,
most speakers who come (or whose parents came from) from Big Pond or
Sand Creek speak what is called the Big Pond Dialect. The Big Pond
Dialect is marked by regular phonological (vowel heightening) and
morphological variation from what is spoken at Polecat (Sapulpa-
Kellyville) and Duck Creek (Hectorville-Mounds). See Chapter 2 for a
description of these variations. The differences are minimal. and speakers
from the different regions can completely understand each other. Some
speakers are fluent in both dialects.
       Speakers carry no judgements of which dialect is better or worse.
In fact. they stress that both are good Euchee. I use the Euchee spoken at
Polecat and Duck Creek communities throughout this grammar. I do this
only because the differences are easily described in terms of variation
from what is spoken in Polecat and Duck Creek. In addition. the Big
Pond Dialect represents fewer speakers (and a smaller community) today
in comparison with the speakers who come from Polecat and Duck Creek.
I use the abbreviation BPD for examples which are given in the Big Pond
Dialect: otherwise, the Euchee spoken in Polecat and Duck Creek will be
given in all examples.
       There is a good possibility that during Gatchet's time there was
another regional dialect. Gatschet worked in the southernmost area
Euchee habitation, and his notebooks reveal consistent phonological
variations from either the Big Pond Dialect or the PolecatPuck Creek
Euchee in the speech of his first (probably three) consultants. The most
consistent variation is the raising of 101to /u/ in several morphemes. For
example, Gatschet consistently records klc- for the human. 3* impersonal
pronominal. In both dialects today this is pronounced ko-/go- Although
there is not an abundance of evidence for a third dialect, the likelihood of
a third exists as there were at least three distinct and geographically
dispersed Euchee areas at the time of the Tribe's removal to Indian
Territory.
       The language also contains lexical variation, especially in new
words, such 'car,' 'curtain,' and 'television.' Whereas some of the variation
in lexical items is systematic between the two dialects, many instances
are not. They are better attributed to family variations. One reason for
the differences is due to shortening words. Nouns in particular can
become extremely long. and some parts may be dropped off (See Chapter
5). In some cases. a shortened fom has become the standard form in onc
arealfamily, but has remained long in others. In addition, there may be
several ways to shonen a word. Some families have shortened a word in
one way and others in another way, and these shortened forms became
the norm. This is not a new occurrence but has been happening
throughout the history of the language. Another source for the difference
is that many of these newer items appeared in everyday use after the
lribal members were dislocated from each other due to allotment. When
a new cultural item was introduced, they would describe it one way, and
another family described it another way. In most of these cases, they are
similar enough, or accurate enough in their descriptions that speakers can
understand the different words.
       The question of regional dialects was examined in a master's thesis
by Abla (Abla 1994). She concluded that there was no dialect variation
in Euchee. Instead, all variation was confined to lexical variation, which
in turn was due to language loss. However, Abla worked with only three
speakers, two of whom are speakers of one dialect. The other is quite
fluent in both dialects. Furthermore, she concentrated on lexical items
which are variable in the ways mentioned above.
       In addition to regional dialects and variation, Euchee varies
according to the gender of the speaker, known within the community as
'men's and women's speech.' In brief, women use different 3"" person
pronouns than men. However, the distinction based strictly on gender is
not so clear cut. but is better described in terms of formal and informal
speech styles, where women are more formal when referring to men.
This is fully explored in Chapter 6, The Noun and Noun Phrase.
       Formal and informal speech styles, or register, can also be seen in
different speech genres in the Euchee repertoire. Informal speech genres
such as conversation, instruction, personal narrative. and telling ghosl
stories will make liberal use of shonened forms and contractions (see
Chapter 2 Phonology). However. too much contraction, or the inability to
recall or use full forms, is not considered good Euchee. Fluent speakers
called this -slanging the language."" This is becoming more common
today, as some speakers use shortened forms exclusively and are no
longer able to easily reconstruct full forms.
       Formal oratory, such as public speech giving and public prayers. is
noted by the use of full forms. Ceremonial speech is the highest register
and in addition to the use of full forms, it is marked by differences in
phonology. One example of ceremonial speech, the Dance Call, is given
in Appendix I and is analyzed in Chapter 2 (see also Jackson and Linn
2000). Formal genres include ceremonial speech at the ceremonial
grounds, public speech giving, prayers, and sermons. Skillful oratory has
long been a prized quality for the Euchee, and speakers are noted for
their ability to speak formally.","[34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]"
"This implies that there are two postions in the gender phrase. However. it is not
clear why the both positions can not have -Ye intervene if the gender phrase is
separate from the verb phrase, The other possibility is that the patient
pronominal in (iv-a) is an independent pronoun. Then it is not immediately clear
why the normal form sedi is not used. However, it is possible that the I"" Euchee
female prefix se- attaches to the stem di for independent pronouns, but may just
a s well attach to another stem, the verb stem or the Yes/No question particle. for
example.
"" Travis (1994), Rice (2000). and Bybee (1985) among others, have suggested
that the functional phrases closest to the verb stem are the most immediate in the
 interpretation of arguments.
?' The 3rd 'person' may in fact be unspecified for person features (Benveniste
 1956; Noyer 1997; Ritter and Rosen to appear). Only I"" and 2"" persons have
features for [+person]and [+number]. As a non-person, 3rd can not be animate.
Euchee provides evidence for this proposal.
'3 The animacy hierarchy in Euchee also provides evidence for a separate gender
phrase. or a functional projection GenP (Linn 1998; Linn and Rosen, in progress).
This means that the traditionally accepted bundle of features in the Spec of AgrS
and AgrO would not include gender.
''  In addition, the contractions with the stem 4u confused the issue.
'*  As in English, the sentence 'I bought it for him' in Euchee is ambiguous
between the two readings, 'the gift is for him' or 'I did the errand for him'
'""aker      (1996: 192-198) notes that in polysynthetic languages, the recipient or
bene faciary (his 'goal') of three-place verbs has patient (his 'theme') agreement.
 However, in Mohawk, the patient is required to be inanimate ('neuter'). This is
not a requirement in Euchee. as can be seen in example (78) of the text, where
the patient is the baby.
"" This analysis is due to the fact that the location 'a reappears on the 3r* person
 patients. These must be given as independent noun phrases. When the patient
of a three-place verb is a demonstrative noun, it is almost exclusively given with
 'a plus the appropriate animate noun class instead of the more common -1r and
 noun class. The 'a demonstratives are seen in the example verb (go)\r*i      'to give'
 in the text. The -1e demonstratives are use with all to-place verbs. The location
 'a is further away than -le, which makes sense as action of an three-place event
 exends away to another person.
''  A possible explanation for this prefix order precedes from the analysis in
 endnote 26. If it is true that the actors dropped off as in the 'aso- '112' irregular
 pronouns, perhaps given in independent pronouns, then they may have been
 reinsened at a later time. Instead of comin in between the fused recipient or
 benefactive pronominal and the stem, they may have attached to the beginning
 of the proniminal complex, creating the irreguiar order.
""   The verb hi 'take' can not be used for *canyT    or 'bring.' The verbs (golk'atltla
 'to go with' or 'to cany' and (gojk'agd 'to come with' or 'to bring' are used instead.
 Both contain the accompaniment prefix ka- 'with.' Therefore, the third
 participant of h5 'take' is a source 'kom someone.' Apparently, the source
 participant in hi 'take' is treated like a recipient or beneficiary and not like other
 sources. which are clause construction (see example 93) in the text). This is
  probably because the source may be human, and when it is human. the person is
  highly affected. The same analysis holds for (go)& 'to receive (from).'
!O
   This is expected in a polysynthetic where the Case roles are on agreement
(Baker 1996).
31 Wagner (1934: 333) gave only the derived set as the first reflexive series.
-''Wagner (1934: 333) gave quite a few more verbs which he said occur
exclusively in the reflexive. The verbs 'yuite'ne 'attempt, try' and j.rt 'naga
'believe' can not be reflexive according to speakers today. Speakers can not use
the verb ry8 to mean 'fast' today. The rest of his list can occur both in the
reflexive or with actor or patient pronominal prefixes.
33 The pronominal look like the derived actor [+participant]forms. However,
there is a possible alternative analysis. That is, the morpheme /we/ is pan of the
3d person stem, just as it is in the Is' and 2"" person. The 3rdperson Euchee
pronominal prefixes have contracted with /we/ and not *yo-. The vowel change
would be the same, and the /y/ in the 3rdEuchee female and 3rdEuchee male
(women's speech could be a result of palatalization with /so. The 3rdnon-Euchee
retains the /we/ in the stem and has reanalyzed it as the pronominal prefix rrv-.
This is supported by the 3""' person inanimate. There is not a 3rd inanimate actor.
but the sentences in 58) of the text show inanimates 'going' with wethla. The
morpheme /we/ is more clearly part of the stem in the related verb (go)\c.eda
'have gone, went. left.' See Chapter 5. Section 2.5 for the paradigm of this verb.

   The underlying form of the 1"" person singular patient is Itsel and 2ndperson
singular patient is n e t ~ e - .However. ltse-/ has become voiced [dze-] and the 2""*
person has become [n~dze-1.The voiceless Itsel is imponant for understanding
the continuing voiceless irregular forms. and the irregular 2"" person patient

affixes (inflectional morphology), except for pronominal agreement. which is

reciprocal and accompaniment valence prefixes. Section 4 contains the aspect

processes of Euchee phonology. It occurs exclusively in rapid speech and the full

Contraction is still the most pervasive phonotogical process in the language.
Contractions are still easily reconstructed when they occur across word
boundaries. However, they are not always apparent inside of noun compounds
today.
         The term 'contraction' is used to identify all instances in which a syllable
is deleted and its deletion triggers a vowel change in the preceding syllable. The
term 'contraction' is used with the speakers of Euchee and is quite useful for
describing the phenomena. There are other instances of deleted syllables in the
language. The term 'deletion' refers to deleted morphemes (a meaningful part of
a word. or independent particle), and there is no change in the preceding
syllable. Deletion occurs in longer noun compounds, and so is discussed in the
Chapter 6, Section 2.3. The difference between contraction and deletion is
