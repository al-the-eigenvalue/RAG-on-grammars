 This formation is only documented for the present and future and restricted to Ist
 and 3"" persons singular and plural. It is constructed by suffixing -m to the pre-
 sent or future participles which are assimilated. The personal endings are those
 of the indicative. The resulting forms are:
                      Present                                              Future

 volvement of the subject or the significance of the act. Witnessed action is a
 typical function of the affirmative. Browne’s affirmative seems to correspond to
 Zyhlarz (1928:67) “durative”. Examples are:
(St. 6.12-7.2)

truly    give birth-ISGPRESIND        —_be-PART-and ~—_Christian-PRED-INCH-1 SGFUTAFF
‘and truly, if | do give birth, | shall become Christian’Werner (1987:164) explains the so-called affirmative as an originally interroga-
tive paradigm because of its morpho-tonological structure. As Werner’s infor-
mants insisted, affirmative forms are never understood as questions but as strong
or emphatic affirmation. He regards a negative question with auxiliary min- as
basis for the affirmative construction which later underwent a semantic shift. The
underlying negative question, however, is presumably not ‘you’re not actually
beating?’, as Werner proposes, but ‘is it not that you are beating/aren’t you beat-
ing?’ which was reinterpreted as ‘you’re definitely beating’. In accordance with
Werner, Browne (ibid.) speaks of a ‘collapsed negative’ in Old Nobiin.
   The suffixes of the affirmative in Modern Nobiin are the following:
 Isc         -minee                 IPL        -minoo
2sG          -mi                    2PL        -minoo
3sG          -mi                    3PL        -mina/-minaaIn Modern Nobiin, the paradigm includes second persons singular and plural.
Werner compares his affirmative to Reinisch’s (1879:71) negative question.
Below, Reinisch’s paradigm is given in comparison to the negative question of
Lepsius:
                                                                                                    99

is obvious. Werner (1987:165) didn’t collect a full paradigm for the negative
interrogative but the examples in his sentences document similar forms to those
of Lepsius.
   It can be questioned whether the modern forms given by Werner actually de-
veloped from the Old Nobiin forms. Although they are undoubiedly similar, the
correspondences are by no means regular. The modern forms are evidently based
                                                                                                       mr
on the negative verb men-/min- whereas the old forms go back to an old negative
formant -m-. Unfortunately, there is not much                    textual evidence      from   Modem
Nobiin to analyze its function. Thus, the question concerning the relationship
between the forms has at present to remain open.","[98, 99, 100]"

9.1 NegationThe negation is one of the numerous periphrastic constructions of Old Nobiin.
Undoubtedly, it is one of the most important and frequent periphrastic construc-
tions as there is no non-periphrastic negation documented. It is built with the
verb men-/min- ‘not to be’ which goes back to an even older prefixed negation
m- + -in-/-en- ‘to be’. In accordance with its important function in the language,
men-/min- can be used in all three types of periphrastic formations, i.e. it can
follow a participle, predicative or indicative. In many instances, emphatic post-
position -/o is attached to the negative verb. Examples for the different types of
periphrastic constructions are:Participle Periphrastic
(ChN. 9.16)
iar-il               min-il-gu-!
understand-PART      not to be-PART-PL-SUB)‘who do not understand’(M. 2.1)
kon-men-na-lo
have-not to be-3SGPRES-EMPH‘she did not have’    (with reduced participle)Predicative Periphrastic
(M. 1.9-19)

kop-ona               men-a
€at-2SGPRETIIND       not to be-3SGPRES
‘it is not that you ate’The indicative periphrastic seems to be rare and even more infrequent in the
documentary texts. Amongst eighteen negative constructions in the texts of Qasr
Ibrim III, none is represented by the indicative periphrastic. This seems to con-
form with an interpretation of the indicative periphrastics as a focus construction
which is not only rare but was also lost in the process of language change. On the
contrary,      reduced        participle   and      predicative   periphrastics   are   predominantly

 documented in these texts. The reduction can go so far as nothing is left of the
 original periphrastic construction, e. g.
 (IT III 56 ii 4)
peff-i-min-il                      ak-ire-lo

el-men-ami
find-not to be-JUSSPRES3SG‘let (him) not find’ (complete loss)The examples with reduced participle and predicative or complete loss of marker
lead over to Modern Nobiin. Here too, the formerly independent verb min-/men-
expresses the negation. In most of the tense/aspect paradigms, a variant muun- is
used. Lepsius, however, presents different forms for 24 person singular and
3"" person plural where old -min- is still preserved. Werner’s paradigm seems to
be further reduced by analogy. There is no trace left of the former periphrastic
construction.         The       element   -min/-muun-     is inserted      between   verbal   basis anc
ending. The paradigm of the negative present is:
                     Werner (1987:159)                    Lepsius (1880:115)

3PL                  -muuna (-muunna)                    -min(n)anPersonal endings are highly reduced. In Lepsius’ paradigm only the Ist and 3"" per-
son singular coincide. Werner’s list shows that the negation was further simpli-
fied because -muun               also replaced the      Ist person plural ending still present at
Lepsius’ time. The origin of -muun remains enigmatic as there is no trace of this
variant in Old Nobiin. Although                 -i- and -u- often interchange         in Old Nobiin,
                                                                                                    123
there doesn’t seem to be one example of it in the case of the negative verb. It can
be speculated whether another negative verb, i. e. mon-/mun- ‘to hate, reject, be
reluctant’ (= m-on- ‘not to love’), forms the basis of this paradigm. There Is,
however, no evidence supporting this suggestion. In all probability, the influence
of the emphatic particle -/o which was regularly suffixed to the negative verb in
Old Nobiin is responsible for the change. A regressive vocalic assimilation might
have led to the change from -i-/-e- to -u-.
   For the preterit, the endings of Old Nobiin were completely replaced by the
innovated complex with -kun- which is only rarely used in the positive form (see
chapter 10.8). The paradigm of the negative preterit is:
                        Werner (1987:160)                            Lepsius (1880:118)

3PL                     -kum-muuna                                   -kum-minnanIn Lepsius’ list, we find an additional form with -min- in the 24 person plural.
Lepsius’ examples reveal that the negative forms originally follow the adjunctive
-a (see chapter 10) which is dropped with verbs ending in a vowel or single con-
sonant.
   Lepsius as well as Abel list some forms which they regard as remains of an old
 preterit negative. In the Ermenne narrative, there is one example Abel discusses:
 (Erm. 129)
 illa    buruu-kududi   wirk-a-kum-mun
 only   girl-small      throw-ADJ-PRET-NEG3SG
 wirko-moon-on-gooni      sultani   issig-j-on
 throw-?-3SGPRET-and      sultan    asked-OBJ-3SGPRET ‘Only the little girl didn’t throw, and (as) she didn’t throw the sultan asked her:” Abel interprets -moon- in the second part of the sentence as variant of the negative
 -muun and denies a possible relationship with the verb moon- ‘to not want to, to re-
 ject’. There are various reasons why Abel’s interpretation seems highly improb-
 able. Firstly, -moon- would be another variant of -miin/-muun- which is only docu-
 mented once. Secondly, Abel doesn’t explain why the regular negative preterit is
 found in the first part of the sentence, but not in the second one. Thirdly, he doesn’t
 explain why wirk- is followed by -o- in the second instance, by adjunctive -a in
 the first one. Correctly understood, -moon- actually is the aforementioned indepen-
 dent verb, together with wirk-, they form a verbal complex with both verbs mark-
 ed as 3d person singular preterit. The whole sentence should be analysed as:
  124
(Erm. 129)

‘Only the little girl didn’t throw, and (as) she rejected to throw the sultan asked them:’Although Abel (1913:68) collected a complete paradigm for his remnant nega-
tive preterit, it has to be asked whether or not a communicative problem between
him and his informant has to be assumed. None of the other forms in the para-
digm are documented in his narrative.
   In a similar way, Lepsius (1880:120) was convinced to have found a few rem-
nants of a former negative preterit. His only example comes from the translations
of the gospel and is wrongly interpreted as pluperfect:
(GM 9, 32)
tariin bannitta        fehemi-ken-kom-mes-san
his    speech         —_understand-IMPERF-PRET-NEG-3PLPRET“they hadn’t understood his speech’As we find the regular -men- (and not -moon-) in this sentence, it is more con-
                                                                                                           nen
vincing        than    Abel’s    example.       The   corresponding       form     listed    by   Werner
(1987:239) is -ken-kum-muuna. On the basis of this one example, Lepsius also
reconstructs a complete paradigm which he calls a negative pluperfect. It will be
argued below that Lepsius misunderstood -ken as a variant of -kun, the former
actually being the marker of the imperfective (sometimes habitual).","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"

‘and truly, if | do give birth, 1 shall become Christian’ (lit.: ‘and truly if | am I give birth’)That most of these constructions represent stylistic variations of non-periphrastic
forms can presumably be regarded as one reason for their disappearance on the
way to Modern Nobiin. Kept, though changed, were those forms with no non-
periphrastic alternatives. Interestingly, most of the second verbs used in peri-
phrastic    constructions       are   preserved       in    Modern     Nobiin:      au-    ‘to do’,   okkir-
(causative of ok- ‘to be’) ‘to put’, dar- ‘to be’, kin- ‘be without, be poor’, midde-
‘be full’ are still documented in the dictionaries as independent verbs.
   The development of the verb in- ‘to be’ which was frequently used in peri-
phrastic constructions constitutes a special case. In affirmative use, it was re-
placed by a verb men- ‘to be’. It looks exactly like the negative verb of Old No-
biin and its origin has to be discussed. That this is a random similarity seems to
be highly improbable. The complete paradigm for the present is listed by Lepsius
(1880:79):
Isc               men or min                               IPL              men-nu

(ibid., 117) gives the paradigm with final -7 assimilated to the negative verb:
IsG               im-mun                                   IPL              im-munu

verbal complexes which was already present in Old Nobiin, but later completely
replaced the periphrastic constructions. If we take into consideration that one of
the functions of the participle and predicative periphrastic with -in and -men was
to topicalize the verb it is perfectly feasible that the topicalized negative verb
was reinterpreted as positive verb ‘to be’.
   In the next chapters, the four constructions which found their way into Mod-
ern Nobiin will be presented.","[120, 121]"
" 6.4 Imperative/Jussive The imperative/jussive of Old Nobiin was marked by the following suffixes:
 Isc                  _
 2sG                  -e(so)
 3sG                  -e(so)

 2PL                  -ana(so)
 3PL                  -ana(so) Browne (1989:29) noticed that in the 2nd and 3"" persons -so is rarely missing.”
 He describes the suffix as emphatic particle. Besides the forms mentioned there
 are additional ones for the 34 person singular and plural:
 SG       -o/anaso         (preterit I)        PL      -ouanaso    (preterit I)
 SG       -ame                                 PL      -isaname    (preterit II) The preterit I + II forms represent the indicative + -so or -me. The remaining
 singular form seems to consist of predicative -a + -me.
    The negative imperative takes the negative auxiliary -men/-min. There is an-
 other form which Browne (1989:30) calls “vetitive”.
 SG        -a-ta-me, -a-ta-m                   PL       -a-tan-ke-(so) The suffix -ta- which characterizes the vetitive is also present in connection with
 the negation in -men which it seems to intensify.",[88]
"Excurse 3: A Short Note on the so-called Emphatic Particles of
Old Nobiin    In many example clauses and sentences cited in this book elements marked as
EMPH for “emphatic” are found suffixed to nominal as well as verbal phrases. A
few remarks on the different particles and their function seem to be indicated.
These remarks focus on Browne’s (1997) classification and commentary which
describe the usage of the emphatic particles. Browne also compiled a catalogue
of examples recommended to those who want to gain a deeper understanding of
the matter.
   In Old Nobiin, two emphatic particles, -/o, and -sin, are documented which
were frequently used in various contexts. The original postposition -/o has two
main functions:
    1. It is a locative (and sometimes instrumental) postposition with the meaning of
   ‘in, (in)to, from’ which is documented          in numerous examples from the texts
   cited in this book.
2. It is an indicator of focus.
The first function is rather clear-cut and need not be commented here. With re-
gard to the second function Browne (ibid.) distinguishes the following uses:
-      -lo is regularly added to a noun marked as predicate and reinforces the notion
       of predication. It could furthermore be interpreted as a copula, a function it
       actually occupies if the nominal subject is missing. With a verbal predicate
       -lo is mostly restricted to the negative.
—     -lo could be suffixed to a nominal predicate in the subjective, then carrying
      the notion of predication and functioning as a copula.
-     -lo could be added as focus marker to a noun or pronouns functioning as
      logical predicate in an adjectival cleft sentence.

      According to Werner (1987:145), the imperative singular of Modern Nobiin is
 identical to the verbal base (e. g. unni ‘give birth!’) and the plural shows a suffix
-an following the ending -i of the verbal base which is, however, often omitted.
Unfortunately, no further information on the origin of the endings and the use
and function of the imperative are given. Werner also makes no mentioning of
jussive forms. One hundred years earlier, Lepsius (1880:139) listed a more com-
plex paradigm (with tokk- ‘to shake’) for the imperative/jussive.
2sG           tokk-ee, tokk-e, tokk-eiaa
3sG           too-ciaa
2PL           tokk-anaa, tokk-an, tokk-anaia
3PL           took-anaiaaThe origin and function of the different endings will be discussed below.
   The negative imperative or jussive of Modern Nobiin evidently corresponds to
Old Nobiin “vetitive” forms. Lepsius (1880:141) points out that these endings
follow -a which is the marker of direct speech (see below), thus adding another
correspondence to the Old Nobiin forms:
Lepsius (1880:141)           SG (-a)-tam/tamece       PL (-a)-tam(m)an/tam(m)anaa
Wemer (1987: 146)            SG -tam                  PL -tamanThe optional -a is no longer documented by Werner (ibid.) who also doesn’t
mention the use of the endings in the 3 person singular and plural. Examples of
the use as negative imperative or jussive are found in the gospel of St. Mark and
in the Ermenne text. Below, some examples are given:

last two negative examples, however, show that the ending was replaced by a
variety of suffixes. These necessitate a longer excurse on the origin of these
elements and their various functions.","[88, 89, 90]"

 9. Periphrastics
Old Nobiin had a wide range of periphrastic constructions which were lost in the
course of the development towards the modern                  language. Browne (1982:26ff.;
 1989:27ff.) was the first to group the different constructions under the heading
“periphrastics” without, however, giving any detailed analysis of the specified
uses of the forms. Old Nobiin periphrastics have in common that they are formed
by attaching in- ‘to be’ or its equivalent to a participle, predicative or indicative.
The resulting constructions are demonstrated with the verb doll- ‘to love’:
Participle periphrastics              doll-il in-
Predicative periphrastics             doll-ira in-
Indicative periphrastics              doll-ina in-Different verbs or elements which presumably have a verbal origin can take the
place of in- ‘to be’. Not all of them can be found in all three types of periphrastic
construction. The following chart shows the different verbal elements and their
distribution:
-men-/-min-            ‘not to be’, negation         (part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
-(a)n-                 ‘to become’, inchoative       (part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
-g(a/i)r-              causative                     (part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
-ke-/-ki-/-k-          habitual                      (part. per.)
-in-                   ‘to be’                       (part. per., pred. per., ind. per.)
-dal-/dar-             ‘to be’                       (part.   per, pred. per.)
-dul-                  ‘to be’                       (part.   per., pred. per.)
-au-                   ‘to do, to make’              (part.   per.)
-k(a)n-                ‘to be’                       (part.   per.)
-kinn-                 ‘be without’                  (part. per.)
-medd-                 “to be full’                  (pred. per.)
-ok-                   ‘to be’                       (part. per.)Browne (1989:27) at first regarded the periphrastic indicative as an emphatic
variant of the non-periphrastic construction which is semantically comparable to
the admirative, the other two he interpreted as mere stylistic variants of the non-
periphrastic constructions. After a more thorough analysis of the data at hand
(Browne 1991:60) he explained the indicative periphrastics with in- and men- as
focus constructions. Participle and predicative periphrastics he regarded as being                                                                                           119
employed to topicalize the verb and “thus to yield the O.N. equivalent of a cleft
sentence, either substantival or adjectival” (Browne 1991:60).
  There is, however, another aspect to be considered here. Four of the elements
mentioned above are part of periphrastic constructions with clearly defined
grammatical          functions     as    negative,     inchoative,         causative,   and    habitual/
imperfective. There is no non-periphrastic alternative to these periphrastics. In
this, they differ from constructions with other verbal elements. From the perspec-
tive of Modern Nobiin, these are of special importance because they are pre-
served, though no longer as periphrastics.
   As the first four constructions will be discussed in detail in the following
chapters, some examples of periphrastic constructions with other elements will
be given below.","[118, 119, 120]"
"                                                                                               17]
          10.8 “Perfect(ive)”          This construction originates in a verbal complex with the verb kon-/kun-/ko- ‘to
          have’ (all three alternative forms are already present in Old Nobiin) as second
          verb. Such a complex is absent in the religious-theological texts, but Zyhlarz
          (1928:167) was the first to notice two examples of this complex as part of a graf-
          fito in Jebel Adda published by Griffith (1913:64ff.). The second verb follows
          the adjunctive -a- suffixed to the first verb and is marked as 34 person singular
          present subjunctive or indicative.

          find a total of five instances for kon-/kun-/ko- as second element in a complex in
          a corpus of 32 texts of different lengths. All examples but one are from personal
          letters or requests, one comes from a commercial transaction.

          ‘the nation having approached’          The example is rather clear-cut grammatically with adjunctive -a- deleted—as it
          is also found in similar constructions—and -ko- following the verb directly. In
          the next example, additional elements and another verb precede -ko-:
           (IT Ill 46.2-3)
           id-doko           nisiti   tor-a       pi-r-ko-n
           you-through cleansing      enter-ADJ   be-CAUS-PERF-3SGPRESSUB           ‘[after] he has caused (them) to enter cleansing through you’           This is a more complex example as Browne (1991:97) interprets a predicative
           periphrastic construction with -pi- ‘to be’ and reconstructs tor-ra pi- with the -r-
           of the predicative deleted. In his grammar (Browne 2002:59, n. 69), however, he
           came to the conclusion that -pi- is only found in participle periphrastics, because
           no example for preceding predicative can be found. It seems probable that it is           172
  not a periphrastic construction but rather a verbal complex and the verb for- is
  followed by adjunctive -a- instead of a predicative -ra-. The second verb in the
  complex is pi- ‘to be’ and the first half of the complex is thus resembling ‘stative
  constructions’ as they are discussed under 10.9. The complex is marked as causa-
  tive by suffix -r- and is completed by -ko ‘to have’ and the 3"" person singular
  subjunctive marker.
      In the next sentence, adjunctive -a- is present which seems to come along with
  the longer variant of ‘to have’ -kon-/-kun-. The complex is also marked as indica-
  tive.

  ‘he has kept you upon your throne’  The last two examples are in the preterit. Although the longer form -kon- is pre-
  sent, adjunctive -a- is missing in the first one.

  ‘the king has ordered you’  In summary,        it can be said that in most of the examples,   the second verb is
  marked as present, but two show past tense suffixes. In two instances, the unre-
  duced -kun/-kon follows the adjunctive -a which is absent with the reduced form
  -ko and in the past tense. These few sentences are insufficient to find any regular-
  ity. They indicate, however, that a process where the verb ‘to have’ was used as
  an aspect marker had presumably started not later than the 12‘ century in spoken
 Nobiin and was occasionally used by individuals in informal written communi-
 cation. Until the end of the documentation of Old Nobiin, it was, however, rarely
 used. Although nothing definitive can be deduced, the few examples point to kon-
 / kun-/ko- marking a ‘classical’ perfect aspect: It is the verb ‘to have’ that can be
 used with different tenses and as far as the contexts are undisputable a state re-
 sulting from an earlier event is expressed in each sentence.
     In Modern Nobiin the situation has changed. The element -kon/-ko is suffixed
 to a verb but only takes the past tense suffixes. The construction with adjunctive
 -a- is lost. The complex is rarely used in the affirmative, but has replaced the old
                                                                                   173
past in the negative (see chapters 6.2 & 9.1). The paradigms which the different
authors present are the following:

plural forms have been reduced. Lepsius’ 1st person plural suffix is more com-
plex than Abel’s. The latter might be a reduction as well as a dialectal variation.
Lepsius and Abel mix and confuse two rather different constructions—the one
discussed here with -kon/-ko, another one with -ken—which they regard as sim-
ple variations. The -ken construction, however, originates in a periphrastic con-
struction of Old Nobiin and marks a habitual as has been described in chap-
ter 9.4. Lepsius (1880:88) and Reinisch (1879:80) call -kon/-ko perfect markers.
Werner (1987:175ff.) fails to distinguish the formation from the preterit and
describes it as expressing an action which was completed in the past.
        In Abel’s Ermenne text are only two examples of an affirmative perfect:
    (Erm. 112)

    sultan, having seen the boy’s doing, and having seen it she loved the boy very much’    -kun is not marked for tense/person in this example, but as part of a verbal com-
    plex where only the last verb (doll-os-on) is marked as 3'4 person singular pret-
    erit. This is not quite typical for verbal complexes because the tense/aspect mark-
    ing of the last verb differs from the one of the other verbs. If we take a look at
    the meaning of the event told here it is rather obvious that the two verbs with
    -kun- refer to events prior to the one described by the last verb.
        In the next example, a verbal complex ends with -kon/-ko and is also marked
    as preterit. As the sentence is in direct speech, the chronological reference point
    is the time of speaking.","[171, 172, 173, 174]"
"
Excurse 2: The Origin of a Complementizer in NobiinAccording to Lepsius (1880:139ff.) the endings -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion are often
attached to the positive and negative imperative. He interprets these suffixes as
alternative and arbitrary forms of a subordinating conjunction. Their use with the
imperative/jussive, he continues, is determined by the conception of these con-
structions as dependent or subordinate. They can be suffixed to any verbal end-
ing without changing its meaning and function. Lepsius distinguishes these end-
ings from identical suffixes he calls shortened and enclitic forms of the verb iig-
‘to say’ which he describes as used parenthetically in narratives corresponding to
Latin inquam, inquit ‘I said, he said’ (Lepsius 1880:330). Abel (1913:15ff.) has
shown that the two are identical. In his Ermenne narrative these endings are
found as -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye and documented about one hundred times within
two hundred sentences. Werner (1987:383) mentions the variants -yon/-ayon/
-eyon in his wordlist. He calls the forms “‘subordinating morphemes”, but doesn’t
discuss their function in his grammar. Although Werner speaks of “subordinating
morpheme”, he adds the translation ‘he said’ to the three variants.
   Lepsius, Werner and Abel agree that the endings originate in the verb iig-,
shortened i- ‘to say’ and that the different forms have to be regarded as clitics.
Looking at Old Nobiin we find evidence that originally two verbs with the mean-
 ing of ‘to say’, igir-/ig- and il(d)- were present. Only il(d)- was occasionally
 reduced to i-. The endings therefore can be traced back to the latter and do not
 originate in igir-/ig- which is still present as independent verb in Modern Nobiin.
    The process which the commentaries of the different authors indicate resem-
 bles the one described e. g. by Lord (1976) for West African Kwa languages
 where the verb ‘to say’ is reinterpreted as a subordinator, which was probably
 first used with complement clauses and was later extended to other clause types.
 According to Lord the process begins when a general verb meaning ‘to say’ is
 90
used to reinforce other verbs of saying in the so-called matrix clause. This is the
case in most of the examples from the Ermenne narrative which have the general
verb jig- ‘to say’ reinforced by -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye, as in
(Erm. 20)
wilidi iiga-tir-a             lala-iye          taf-fabi      wide      mas-aiye           iden-ga     ed-0os-on

‘he said to them: “I want a contract with you” [-he said], [...], they said: “but what is your contract”
(-they said)’In the sentences of the Nubian textbook Werner based his grammar on, this con-
struction is found in connection with direct speech in almost the same way as in
the Ermenne text:
(Wermer 1987:306, 40.11-12)
kaj       murti-g             iiga-tir-o               in            kirri_   gittir-aya

sentence above, each statement is completed by -ayon or -eyon. It can be con-
cluded that the endings not only reinforce the verb ‘to say’, but generally mark
direct speech, although they are not obligatory.
    In the next examples the notion of direct speech is lost and the endings func-
tion as complementizers:
(GM 9,11)
iig-innan           eeliiaa     fa-ki-in-iaa
Say-3PLPRES         Elias       1FUT-come-3SGPRES-COMP‘they say that Elias will come’At the same time the endings come to be used as complementizers after a whole
range of matrix verbs which include verbs of cognition and perception, but most
of all with different verbs of speaking.","[90, 91]"
"
                                                                                                           131
In the last example, it can either be understood that the “blood of the innocent” is
habitually or repeatedly shed. Thus, we might have a case of the generalization
of grammatical function where a habitual developed into an imperfective.
    Expectedly, in Modern Nobiin no traces of the former periphrastic construc-
tion can be found. Instead, we find an unchangeable suffix -ken- which only
takes the endings of the past, thus forming the following paradigm (Werner
 1987:176):
1sG                 -kess                                IPL                  -kess

-kun- “perfect(ive)” (see chapter 10.8) and -ken- interpreting both as variants of
the perfect marker. Reinisch (1879) agrees with this interpretation but restricts its
use as a variant to the negative. Werner (1987:177, 301) interprets -ken- as habit-
ual marker. He cites some examples from a Nubian textbook translated by him:
madrasa-l juu-kess                ‘I used to go to school’
assar-ii dan batar-kess           ‘1 used to play with children’
diigdakil aay-kess                ‘I used to do much’These examples come from a lesson within the textbook for Arabic speakers
learning Nubian. Although it tries to tell a little story about a grandfather speak-
ing about his childhood, they are not part of a continuous text but isolated sen-
tences. The translation as habitual ‘used to’ cannot be deduced by a context.
Thus, it is interesting to look at some examples in the longer texts which might
give us some indication of why the early authors confused the constructions with
-kun- and -ken-. Although he doesn’t refer to them in his grammar, Reinisch has
some examples in his Nobiin stories which are translated as habituals:
(RL, 216, 15-17)
unde-n       kin-ni-naani                abelhiBeen-ii    dii-o-ji-kawamini
 habit-GEN      way-belonging to-GEN     fox-PL           die-DIR-PL-CONDPRES3PL(?) ukki   weeka     ——_ wissiki-kes-san
 ear    one-OB)     jiggle-IMPERF-3PLPRET
 ‘after the habitual way foxes used to jiggle one ear, if they were dead.’ Reinisch translates the beginning of the sentence as ‘from ancient times’ which is
 not the literal meaning, and cites more examples with the same introduction. The
 next example comes from a slightly different context.","[131, 132]"

"5.1 “Clause Conjugation” and “Sentence Conjugation”The smallest unit which represents a complete predication in Old Nobiin consists
of a subject marked as genitive and a predicate which is either a participle or the
subjunctive. As it is attested only as a subordinate clause Browne (1982:11)
called it clause conjugation. He represented its components as follows:
clause conjugation:                    subject                             predicate
                                       noun                                participle
                                                          + -n(a)
                                       pronoun                             subjunctive
 Participle and subjunctive are verbal nouns. The subjunctive is formed by suffix-
 ing personal endings to the different participles. Thus, it overtly expresses person
and number in contrast to the participle. Application of various phonological
rules generates the different endings presented in chapters 6.1 and 6.2. Unless the
subject of the participle is identical to the one of the main clause or to be taken
 from the context it has to be expressed. The subjunctive must be used if the sub-
ject is not evident.
    Browne (ibid.) analyzed the Old Nobiin verbal syntax on the basis of different
elements suffixed to the predicates of the “clause conjugation”. These elements
are the so-called “postpositions of conversion to sentence status” or “sentence
converters”. They help to convert a “clause conjugation” into a “sentence conju-
gation”. He distinguished between the “primary sentence conjugation” which is
                                                                                                     65
formed directly from the “clause conjugation” and the “secondary sentence con-
jugation”, which is built upon the “primary sentence conjugation”.
   The most important formant of the “primary sentence conjugation” is predica-
tive -a, which can also mark nominal predicates. If -a is suffixed to a participle,
the so-called predicative emerges. Again, person and number are not morpho-
logically marked. The subject must be expressed and marked as such if              it is a
noun and cannot be understood within the context. If the predicative -a is suf-
fixed to the endings of the subjunctive the indicative emerges which also has
person and number suffixes. A nominal subject has to be marked by the suffix
-(i)I. One of the periphrastic constructions, the so-called periphrastic predicative,
also belongs here.
    The origin of the different constructions of the “primary sentence conjuga-
tion” can be represented as follows:
subject             predicate
                    subjunctive                         indicative
noun      -|
pronoun                                  +-a=
                    participle                          predicative
                    participle           + -in=         periphrastic predicative
What Browne (ibid.) called “secondary sentence conjugation” emerges by suffix-
ing certain elements to the indicative or predicative. Most of these constructions
belong to the periphrastic constructions or the copulative. The most common of
the former are the “predicative periphrastic” and the “indicative periphrastic”
which are formed by combining a predicative or indicative with the verb -in ‘to
be’ or an equivalent (see in detail below chapter 9). The periphrastic indicative
seems to have an emphatic function whereas the periphrastic predicative is inter-
 preted as a stylistic variant of the non-periphrastic constructions.
      Another construction based on the predicative is the “predicative copulative”
 which represents one of the more uncommon         formations. The element -7(a) is
 documented as a copula with an antecedent noun in the predicative. It is also
 found with verbs in the indicative, a construction which Browne (ibid.) called
 “indicative copulative”, and which seems to focus the verb. A final formation
 based on the indicative is the “‘copulative with -me”, which is also present with
 nouns and pronouns in the predicative. Its function has yet to be described. Zyh-
 larz (1928:102) called -me “affirmative copula”. The most important construc-
 tions of the “secondary sentence conjugation” can be presented as follows:
 66
subject            predicate
                   indicative    {   + -m(a)       = _ indicative copulative
                                     +-me          = _ copulative in -me
noun -I            indicative                      = __ periphrastic indicative
pronoun                              + -in
                   predicative       et sim.       = __ periphrastic predicative
                   predicative       +-le          = __ predicative copulative
                                     + -(I/as)ke
A detailed discussion of the different tense/aspect forms will be presented in the
following chapters.","[65, 66, 67]"

 10. Grammaticalization of Verbal Complexes
10.1 IntroductionThe loss of periphrastic constructions in the development from Old to Modern
Nobiin coincided with an increasing use of constructions involving so-called
adjunctive -a (see chapter 5.2). Zyhlarz (1928:111) was the first author who
recognized an additional function of predicative -a. It is used in so-called verbal
complexes of Old Nobiin. Verbal complexes are verb strings with two or more
verbs sharing a common subject where verbal morphology only occurs on the
last verb. The other verb(s) often take(s) predicative -a which, however, may be
elided. In accordance with Hintze (1975:16), the -a element in these formations
is called “adjunctive”, although it is presumably identical to the predicative. The
verbal complexes show many characteristic features of serial verb constructions,
but differ in that, for example, overt markers of coordination are possible. Al-
though the numerous authors dealing with serial verb constructions in the lan-
guages of the world do not always agree on what is absolutely necessary to de-
fine one, the absence of this kind of overt marking is listed by Aikhenvald
(2006:1): “A serial verb is a sequence of verbs which act together as a single
predicate, without any overt marker of coordination, subordination, or syntactic
dependency of any other sort.” In many instances, the different verbs constitute a
single predicate and the serial verb construction describes what is conceptualized
as a single event. Aikhenvald (2006:4ff.) lists the following typical formal and
semantic properties:
 1. Serial verb constructions act as single predicates.
2. Serial verb constructions are monoclausal and allow no markers of syntactic
  dependency on their components.
3. The verbs in a serial verb construction share tense/aspect, mood,     modality,
   and polarity value.
4. Serial verb constructions refer to one overall event.
Although, as some examples show, verbal complexes may have typical features
of serial verb construction, they more often seem to agree with what can be
called “clause chaining”. DeLancey (1991), who analyzed Tibeto-Burman Lhasa,                                                                                137
describes constructions which express sequences of events. One or more verb(s)
take(s) non-final affixes and is/are followed by a finite verb with tense/aspect/
mood affixes. Although most of the constructions analzyed by DeLancey refer to
multiple events, there are some verbs occurring as final and finite verbs which
combine with preceeding non-final verbs to express single events. The verb ‘go’
for example expresses distal directionality as final verb. In these constructions,
DeLancey argues, the last verbs became reanalyzed as aspect markers. Having
undergone this process they may occur with non-final markers. DeLancey speaks
of ‘serialized’ verbs in this context. It will be demonstrated below that similar
developments can be observed in Old Nobiin.
   In Old Nobiin, we find numerous instances of verbal complexes where at least
two verbs combine and function as single predicate, as in
(IT III 57 ii 1-2)
mani-kon           dok-on-j-eso
eyes-and           kiss-love-PLOBJ-IMPERSG
‘and (lovingly) kiss his eyes!’The two verbs of this complex are directly attached to each other without an
intervening element.                  Furthermore,   the construction     seems    to fulfil all of the
above criteria of verb serialization as does the next example from a release cer-
tificate for a former slave.
(IT III 33. 7-8)
aiu [...] yjopa             gra      nar-kaj-a-sin
 I         [...]   Nubian   like   keep-keep-PREDPRES-EMPH ‘I [...] keep (him) as a Nubian’ In most of the verbal complexes, however, the different verbs are marked by
 adjunctive -a. Furthermore, they need not to be contiguous and are occasionally
 coordinated by -on ‘and’ as the following examples show:
     (CRN 7.14-16)
     it-a        wel        tid-a-sin               wer-ildo            ak-a__—thalasu_uattto-ka
     man-PRED    one        encounter-PREDPRES-EMPH mountain-upon       sit-ADJ sea      whole-oB)
     gill-a            nik-k-ik-ka
     consider-ADJ      see-come-PARTPRES-OB)
     ‘[...] it is a man, he encounters, sitting upon a mountain, considering looking coming at the whole
     sea.”","[135, 136, 137, 138]"
"9.5 Copulative Constructions For the sake of completeness, two additional periphrastic constructions have to
 be mentioned here. The following copulative constructions were much less
 common in Old Nobiin. Browne’s (1989:29) ‘predicative copulative’ is restricted
 to the 2™4 persons singular and plural. It complements the affirmative (see chap-
 ter 6.5) which provides the Ist and 34 persons. The suffixes -/e (SG) and -ke (PL)
 are attached to the predicative, in the plural -/- precedes in the present and fu-
 ture/intentional, -as- in the present and preterit. The forms documented in the
 texts are:
 Present              SG   --        PL_   -ra-l-ke, -(r-)as-ke
 Preterit I           SG   -ara-le   PL    -ar-as-ke
 Future/Intentional   sG   -dra-le   PL    -arra-l-ke
 134
Modern Nobiin has a full paradigm for the so-called affirmative which provides
enough reason for the disappearance of the form.
   Browne (ibid.) identified another periphrastic construction which he called
“indicative copulative”. Postposition -m/(a), otherwise known as following nouns
in the predicative, is suffixed to an indicative. The examples suggest that in these
cases it topicalizes the verb, as in:
(NC 20.5-6)
kim-mis-so-m             ni-mis-so-ma
Cat-NEG-IPLPRETIIIND-COP drink-NEG-1 PLPRETIIIND-COP
‘is it we did not eat, it is we did not drink’That these constructions were uncommon in Old Nobiin might be one reason
they completely disappeared like most of the other periphrastic constructions of
Old Nobiin.","[134, 135]"
"
 6.5     Admirative/A ffirmative In the first version of his Old Nobiin grammar, Browne (1989:26) discussed a
 formation which he called admirative. He later (2002:59) agreed with Werner’s
 (1987:164) designation of the probable Modern Nobiin equivalent as affirmative.",[98]
"
3.4 Formation of NounsOld Nobiin had a rich inventory of noun formation suffixes some of which will
be presented and discussed below. Of interest will be those still found in Modern
Nobiin either as productive elements or lexicalized.
   A well documented suffix forming abstract and concrete nouns from verbs is
-at(t)-      as in
tapp-att-            ‘destruction’      from    tapir-        ‘to destroy’
seu-att-             ‘heir’             from    seu-          ‘to inherit’The element is preserved as -afti in Modern              Nobiin. According to Werner
 (1987:91) and Lepsius (1880:29), -atti marks a person, but has a negative conno-
 tation in most of the cases, as in
 banp-atti           *babbler’          from    banp-         ‘to speak’
 di-atti             ‘murderer’         from    di-           ‘to die’
 mark-atti           ‘thief?            from    mark-         ‘to steal, to rob’The negative connotation doesn’t correspond to the Old Nobiin examples. There,
however, we find the denominative and deverbative agent formant -katti which
 produces comparable nouns, such as48
uk-katt-/ur-katt-       ‘oppressor, enemy’       from      ur           “to (op)press’”
nape-katt               ‘sinner’                 from     nape          ‘sin’The last example is also listed by Lepsius (1880:367) as
nabce-gatti             ‘sinner’Another similar derivation with a negative connotation in Modern Nobiin is
marja-gatti             ‘liar’                   from      marja        ‘lie, wrong’Old Nobiin -Xatt- is not restricted to pejorative contexts as other examples show.
The same holds true for Modern Nobiin. Both Lepsius and Wemer noted words
ending in -atti in the vocabularies which do not fall in this semantic category, but
are not accounted for. Examples are
fag-atti                ‘half?                   from      fag-         ‘to divide’
till-atti               ‘sweat’                  from      till-        ‘to sweat”
unn-atti                ‘progeny’                from      unn-         ‘to bear, to give birth to”Old Nobiin pak-katt- ‘share, half? from pag- ‘to share’ shows that an original
-katti might have been reduced in these examples. unnatti is not documented in
Old Nobiin, and (ilatti is only found in a doubtful instance in IT III 39.24 where
Browne (1996:171) tentatively translates ‘bosom’.
   To further complicate the situation unnee-gatti ‘wise man’ from unnee ‘under-
Standing, thoughts’ has to be cited which was documented by Lepsius
(1880:406).           This de-nominal        derivation   corresponds   to Old      Nobiin     une-katt-
‘wise’ from une- ‘understanding’. There is no evidence that -gatti is productive
in Modern Nobiin and seems to be present only in lexicalized from.
    Another suffix in the context of word formation which is present in Old No-
biin and still productive in the modern variant is the denominative and deverbal
abstract noun formant
-itt-         as in
aru-itt-                ‘irrigation’             from     aru-          ‘rain’
iskel-itt-              “request, prayer’        from     iskel-        “to beg’Werner (1987:87) lists ewitti- ‘field work’, fayitti ‘scripture’, and uwitti ‘second’
as examples for the productive suffix in Modern Nobiin. The last two are inter-
esting because the corresponding words in Old Nobiin look quite different. Mod-
ern Nobiin faay- ‘to write’ corresponds to Old Nobiin par-. The phonological
changes are regular ones. Instead of the deverbal noun *paritti- ‘scripture’, how-
ever, pa(a)rt- and pait- ‘scripture, writing’ are found in the Old Nobiin texts. Of
quite a different nature is the example of wwitti ‘second’ from uwwo ‘two’. In
Modern Nobiin, ordinals are regularly formed by suffixing -itti to the cardinals.
The only exception is wrragi ‘beginning, initially’ which is used as ordinal ‘first’
                                                                                                      49
instead of *weeritti from weer- ‘one’. Only some of the ordinals are preserved in
the old texts but we find formations with -ift(i) for ‘3d’ tuskit(t)-, ‘4’ kemsit()-
and ‘7th’ kolotit-. The corresponding number ww(wo) ‘two’ is present, but the
ordinal documented is wil- ‘second’. Only in one text, IT 1 11, we find circum-
stantial evidence for the existence of another form. In line 9, the ordinal ‘12!’ is
part of the expression dimedu witinin ‘it being the twelfth’. witi- corresponds to
modern wwitti ‘second’. In line 8 of the same text, wif- seems to be part of a
compound noun ‘two small feasts’. As these examples are singular the evidence
is not conclusive. The most convincing explanation of present-day uwitti- is as a
formation analogous to the other ordinals.
    A suffix which forms abstract nouns from verbs and nouns is
-k(i)-       as in
it-k-                  ‘mankind’               from   it-         ‘man’
tur-k                  ‘setting’               from   tor-        ‘to enter’-k(i)- is neither discussed nor recognized by Werner (1987) or Lepsius (1880).
 Lepsius’ Nobiin vocabulary, however, includes derivation as jag-ki ‘fear’ from
jag ‘to fear’, and Khalil (1990) also records a number of formations with the
suffix -k(i)-, as e. g.
afri-ki              ‘beauty’                  from   afri-       “beautiful”
gak-ki               ‘gap, crack, cleft’       from   gak-        ‘to rip, to crack, to break’
abinti-ki            ‘benignity, placidness’   from   abint       “benign, gentle, soft’Into the same category of abstract formation falls the suffix -kane- as in
aigajkane-             ‘exultation’            from   ai(l)gaj-   “to exult”
aiokkane-              ‘grudging*              from   aiol-       ‘to be grudging”
                                                                  (with assimilation of -l-)In ChN 6.20, one instance with geminated nasal is found
aik-kann-              ‘spirituality’          from   ail-        ‘heart, soul’Lepsius (1880:28ff.) describes a presumably corresponding suffix -kennee which
forms abstract nouns from verbs, nouns and adjectives, as in
assar-kennee            ‘childhood’            from   assar       ‘small, child’
mas-kennee              ‘the good’             from    mas        ‘good’
uus-kennee              ‘misdoing’             from    uus-       ‘bad, evil’
ed-kennee               ‘wedding’              from    ed-        “to take, to marry’The suffix -it is a general noun formant both from verbs and nouns. Although
Zyhlarz (1928:21) listed an -it suffix, he did not succeed in determining the ver-
bal origin of his examples. In his earlier works, Browne did not recognize the
50
       derivational morpheme. It is in the Qasr Ibrim texts that most of the nouns are
       found (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996:229). Examples are
       tisk-it          ‘destruction’           from   tisk-          ‘to destroy’
       unn-it           ‘birth’                 from   unn-           ‘to bear, to give birth’
       pisteu-it        ‘belicf”                from   pisteu-        ‘to believe’
       doll-it          ‘wish, desire’          from   doll-          ‘to wish’
       od-it            ‘illness’               from   od(d)-         ‘to be sick’
       tei-it           ‘hope’                  from   tei-           ‘to hope’
       kap-it           ‘loaf (of bread)’       from   kap-           “to eat’
       kit-it           “garment”               from   kit(ir)-       ‘to dress’       In one Old Nobiin text, Chrisostomus Nubianus, the derivation
       ag-id            ‘seat’                  from   ag-            ‘to sit’       is documented. This leads over to Modern Nobiin where the corresponding -iid/
       -id is the most productive suffix used to derive verbal nouns from all kinds of
       verbs. Examples can be found in Werner (1987:202) and Lepsius (1880:28).
       Khalil documents (1996:57) kap-id ‘round, thick loaf of bread’ which directly
       corresponds to Old Nobiin kap-it (see above).
          This unquestionable correspondence makes Browne’s (2002:27) equation of
       the suffixes -it and -t highly improbable. Old Nobiin -f- is another deverbal and
       denominal noun formant which is documented in examples as
       iar-t            ‘knowledge’             from   iar-           ‘to know’
       gut-t            ‘shame’                 from   gur-           ‘to be shameful’
                                                                      (with assimilation)
       dumart-          ‘power’                 from   dum(m)ar-      ‘to rule over, hold’       The modern correspondence is the suffix -¢i, Nouns with final -ti are frequent in
       present-day Nobiin        but it doesn’t seem to be a productive derivational suffix.
       Examples are
       nur-ti           ‘flour’                 from   nuur        ‘to thresh, to grind’
       jor-ti           ‘oath’                  from   jor         *to swear’       The suffix -; is presumably an allomorph of -é- after d, n, j, and yl, as Browne
       (2002:27) has pointed out. He cites the examples
       sonoj-j-         ‘office of the sonoj’
       an-j-       ;    ‘life, savior’          from   an-               ‘to live’       The last example is also listed by Khalil (1990:113) for Modern Nobiin:
       aan-ji           ‘life’                  from   an-             ‘to live’       Another suffix which forms abstract nouns from verbs and nouns is

and -ee with a long vowel. The latter is most probably a loan from Kenzi (Wer-
ner 1987:81). Examples from derivate nouns with short vowel -e are, e. g.
gug-e             ‘flatulence,        from       gug-          ‘to swell, to bloat’

 of language change. These formants will not be discussed here.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"

-sin is employed as emphasizer and copulative, the latter being the primary us-
age.
   -sin puts a whole verbal clause or verbal sentence into focus. Repetition of
   the particle within the clause or sentence is common but not obligatory.
   It also functions as focus marker in nominal sentences.                    ;
   With -appa ‘for’, the particle is obligatory and it may serve as a copulative
   with a preceding noun.
   -sin regularly has a causal implication, whether it is repeated      in the same
   sentence or not. The causal implication has to be inferred from context. The
   basic function remains that of a copulative.
   Suffixed to a noun in the predicative, -sin marks the antecedent of a relative
    clause.
The different functions of the so-called emphatic particles in Old Nobiin outlined
above might explain why so many sentences and clauses with -sin and even more
so with -/o are found in the texts and in the examples given in this study. In spite
 of these numerous examples from Old Nobiin, the two emphatic particles obvi-
 ously have disappeared in Modern Nobiin. The evidence is insufficient to finally
 decide on the matter but Khalil (1996) is the only one who cites in his dictionary
 of Modern Nobiin a suffix -sen with the presumed meaning of ‘yes, certainly,
 sure’ which presumably corresponds to ‘Old Nobiin’ -sin as the translation sug-
 gests an emphatic connotation.","[103, 104]"

 ‘and also all who were in her house were barren’ Here, we find a predicative periphrastic construction (see chapter 9) in mir-a-
gue-lo is-sana with a literal meaning of approximately ‘they were the being
barren’. Again, the relative clause is marked as predicative, mifJan- ‘all’ is the
referent and takes the suffix of the subjective. This is an example for Type 3
construction because the main verb is in the indicative.
    Finally, Satzinger (1990:196) lists an additional type of relative clause which
is characterized by a referent with predicative ending followed by -sin. The latter
is one of all in all three elements which Browne (1997) described as Old Nobiin
emphatic particles and which fulfilled a wide range of different functions. The
relative clause has either the participle or the subjunctive.
    In a sales contract from Qasr Ibrim, we find such a construction in a documen-
tary context:
(IT III 37, 19-20)
jan-a-sin            etti-ji-sil-gu-I-lon                         nap-il     20-lo
price-PRED-COP       receive-OBJPL-PARTPRETII-PL-SUBJ-and         gold-SUBJ 20-COP
‘and the price which I received is 20 gold’Again, the first part consists of a nominal sentence. Predicative -a- is enforced by
-sin. A noun in the predicative followed by -sin as referent of a relative clause is
also documented several times in the more formal religious texts (Browne 1996).
The verb of the relative clause is a participle preterit II marked as plural subjec-
tive because the price consists of several pieces of gold. Literally, the meaning of
the whole sentence is ‘it is 20 gold it is the price having been received’.
   In Modern Nobiin, various changes conceming the construction of relative
clauses can be observed. As has been mentioned before predicative and subjunc-
tive have disappeared and also the once omnipresent emphatic/focus/copulative
particles -/o and -sin were lost.
    Instead of the lost constructions, Modern Nobiin occasionally employs two
clauses marked as indicatives, one of which functions as main, the other one as
relative clause, as in:
                                                                                                    211

tied, no one ever mounted it’. Although this is not rendered in the English trans-
lation there seems to be two relative clauses in the Nubian version. As in one of
the examples from old Nobiin above, one relative clause is embedded between
the referent and its modifier which both have the suffixes of the objective case.
The literal meaning of the clause is ‘a donkey’s foal which is tied’ and the stative
verb is marked as indicative. The subject of the relative clause is the object of the
main clause. The second relative clause is juxtaposed and has the suffixes of the
negative indicative. A new subject is introduced in the second relative clause but
its object is identical to the object of the main clause.
    More often, we find relative clauses with participles, as in the next two exam-
ples from the gospel of St. Mark:
(GM 5.32)
gelb-on                     (iden             saw-ohe              tiiraa

‘he buries him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock’t is interesting to note that although Nobiin is basically a verb final language the
main verb is clause initial in both instances. Also in both sentences, the main
verb is followed by a postpositional phrase into which the relative clause is em-
bedded. The postposition is clause final. Only in the first example, however, the
participle is marked as object.
    In the Ermenne narrative, we find various examples with participles in the
relative clauses. The following one shows the expected word order with the ref-
erent in front and the main verb in clause final position:
(Erm. 15)
wide[ideni (in-wilit-ta                   hidm-i ))——_iig-a-tir-on

212
 The following example shows striking similarities to some of the Old Nobiin
 examples because the pronominal subject of the relative clause is marked as
 genitive. The referent, on the other hand, is marked as object according to its re-
 lationship to the subject of the relative clause, as opposed to its status in the main
 clause.

clauses:
(Erm 31)

ashes, and eat’The main clause is marked as interrogative and consists of a verbal complex with
a pronominal subject ir mug-os-a juu kab-o ‘did you leave, go, eat?’. The relative
clause is represented by a present indicative, udr-eedaag-a-te-rii, the other one
by a participle marked as object, okk-a-/fi-i-ka. The first one takes the position of
the object of the transitive verb mug- ‘leave’, the second one modifies the loca-
tive noun phrase ‘diidee’.

subject in sentence final position. The copula -/in is added which regularly ex-
presses identity of two nouns or pronouns. Here, the second noun is the unex-
pressed subject of the relative clause.
   Lepsius (1880:67ff.) describes an independent relative pronoun faa in his
grammar. Werner (1987:128) addresses Lepsius’ suggestion but is doubtful about
the actual function of faa. He cites Almkvist (1911:248) and von Massenbach
(1933:214) who translate ‘only’ which also corresponds to a translation given by
one of Abel’s informants (Abel 1913:50). Werner’s isolated examples, such as
                                                                                                             213
ay taa ay lii, allow the translation ‘I am who I am’ as well as ‘I am only I’. It
helps to look at the following example from Lepsius’ translation of the gospel
because it documents faa followed by the Arabic loan bes ‘only’.
(GM 2,26)

‘he ate the consecrated bread which only priests eat’As it seems improbable that ‘only’ is rendered twice in one clause, the example
can be regarded as evidence for the use of faa as an element which introduces
relative clauses.
   Amongst several different contexts Abel documents fa(a) in his narrative.
There is one which seems to correspond to Lepsius’ example:
(Erm. 76)
ta-in         eye          irin   kene    simark-a-fi-e-[y]                         ai-logo   mola-ije
REL-DEM?      [she said]   your   so     be angry-ADJ-STAT-INFPRES{she said]        I-to      close-[she said]‘this which [she said] makes you angry-[she said], is easy for me’
The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘that which is your being angry about, is
close to me’. Whether -in actually represents the demonstrative or is a remnant of
-in ‘to be’ is difficult to decide.
      Lepsius (1880:391) documents another context in which faa is used:
(GM 2,10)
taa  uk-koo     n_irber-okom
FIN     you-PL-and   know-2PLPRES‘and so that you may know’Here, faa seems to introduce a final clause. All things considered there isn’t
enough evidence to draw definite conclusions concerning the origin of faa. As is,
however, documented for other languages too, the element might be related to
the 3-4 person singular pronoun far (see e.g. Heine & Reh 1984:280). There
doesn’t seem to be any evidence for this type of construction in Old Nobiin. This
might explain why only very few instances can be found in the known texts. An
equivalent can presumably be found in those relative clauses introduced by de-
monstrative pronoun in.
    Lepsius (ibid.) describes another construction as equivalent of a relative
clause. This is introduced by an interrogative pronoun and interpreted by him as
an indirect question. His examples are from the translation of the gospel:

    examples are found in the texts. None                   of the contexts can be interpreted as
    equivalent of a relative clause.
       Summing up the different constructions of relative clauses in Modern Nobiin
    presented above, the following overview can be put together:
            . indicative + noun-OBJ + indicative (+ modifier [+ postposition])
NDnkwnd —
            . indicative + noun-(OBJ) + participle-(OBJ) (+ modifier [+ postposition])
            . noun + noun-OBjJ + participle + indicative
            - noun(-OBJ) + noun-GEN + participle + indicative
            . (noun) + noun-OBJ + indicative + taa (+ noun) + indicative
            . nai(-OBJ) + different types of clauses                  °
 The overview is far from being exhaustive. A systematic study of Nobiin syntax
 will presumably uncover additional types and enable more systematic categoriza-
 tion. It can, however, be concluded that the type most frequently used employs
 the participle in the relative clause. These types more or less correspond to the
 construction in Old Nobiin presented above. Juxtaposition of two indicatives is
 also documented rather frequently and presumably corresponds to a construction
 with subjunctive in the relative clause in Old Nobiin. The types with introducing
 pronouns are rarely used and are not present in Old Nobiin.","[210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"

     The impersonal as well as personal forms of the relative seem to be neutral
  with regard to tense/aspect. The following three examples from the Menas leg-
  end show different tense/aspect markers in the consequent.
  (M. 4.13-15)
  itt-il-lon             pes-sna                    alesin in-no    tukr-en    is-gil            jo-din
  woman-SUBJ-and         say-3SGPRETIIIND           truly this-from leave-COND where-to          go-2SGOFUTSUB
  ‘and the woman said: “truly, if you depart from here to where will you go” The consequent is marked as future/intentional and action expressed in the ante-
 cendent can be understood as taking place either in the present or future. In the
 main clause, the indicative would have been expected.
 (M. 4.16-5.4)
 agopp-il           pes-ara               alesin     od-il         ai-ka   = mudu-konno
 skipper-SUBJ       say-PREDPRETI         truly      god-SUBJ      I-OBJ     guide-3SGCOND filoxenith-gille-lo        —_ju-re
 Philoxenite-to-EMPH        go-ISGPRESIND ‘the skipper said: “truly, if god guides me, I go to Philoxenite”’ The consequent is marked as present and therefore, the antecedent is understood
 as taking place at the same time.
 (M. 6.10)
 alesin unn-re                          en-en-non            Xristianos-a-n-adimme
 truly   give birth-ISGPRESIND be-COND-and                   Chistian-PRED-INCH-1SGOFUTAFF
 ‘And truly, if 1 do give birth, | shall become Christian’In choosing an indicative periphrastic construction for the conditional antece-
dent, an additional tense/aspect marking was made possible. The indicative is
marked as present, the conditional has no marker for tense/aspect, and the conse-
quent has the suffixes of the future affirmative.
   The combination of conditional + imperative is also documented in the docu-
mentary texts where the modern forms of the conditional with -ka- seem to be
preferred:
(IT Il 51, 6-8)

                                                                                                                 189
Although Moder Nobiin alleeg ‘truly’ is documented as correspondence to Old
Nobiin alesin it is not used in conditional clauses.                                              Instead an optional parti-
cle/conjunction, -on/-lon is employed which is suffixed to the subject of the
protasis, as in
(Erm. 5)
wide      nor-oni    gemiil-tan-go             timm-oo-ko-kani                            [...J
and       god-if     goodness-his-OB)          fulfils-DIR-PERF-1SGCOND
‘and if god fulfils his goodness [...]’Most certainly, modern -on/-/on originates in Old Nobiin -on (-/lon after -/-) ‘and,
but’. There are contexts in Old Nobiin texts in which -on is used to introduce a
conditional or temporal consequent, as in
(M. 3. 1-9)

    vater of the holy one’ f the assumption of a relationship between old and moder -on is correct a shift
in function has taken place, from introducing an apodosis to introducing the
conditional protasis. According to Abel (1913:21), ten out of twenty-one relative
clauses have -on/-lon most of which are attached to a personal pronoun.
       As for the sequence of tenses in ‘open’ conditional clauses, the texts present
the following combinations:
                              Antecedent                                          Consequent
                1.            present conditional                                 future/intentional, e. g.
(Erm. 19)
ai      ed-oo-kaie                            ikka     in-ideni             fa-kuud-an-o-tee-n

    190
             2.           present conditional                        imperative, e. g.
(GM 13.29)
ingirraa            nak-kawooii          in-iin       —_—kik-kanii
(in) this way      sce-2PLCONDPRES       this-GEN     come-3SGCONDPRESirbir-ana                 moola-iaa        baab-n        _—_—urrag-laa
recognize-IMPERPL         be near-COMP     door-GEN      front-at‘if you see in this way if it comes recognize that he is near in front of the door’It is interesting to note that the subject of the second conditional is marked as
genitive. Similar constructions have been observed by Abel (193 1:27ff.). In these
instances, the verb seems to be interpreted as a nominalized verbal form.
   An exception to the otherwise more or less strict sequence of tenses/aspects in
conditionals is found in the next example from the Ermenne narrative:
(Erm. 75)
aawo-tik-kaye               ken           diioos-eye           ebeden-ogo       aag-a-timmu-mun
do-BEN-ISGCONDPRES          in order that die-[she said]       never-in         HAB-ADJ-accomplish-3SGNEGPRES
‘if I do (sth.) so that he dies it is never accomplished‘The use of the present in the consequent is probably linked to the use of the ha-
bitual. Although the habitual is not expressed in the antecedent it is understood,
and the implicit meaning is ‘every time I do something so that he dies...’.
    Examples for remote or counterfactual conditionals are rare in the texts. As
has been mentioned before these constructions serve as irrealis in Old Nobiin.
Marker of the irrrealis is the suffix -en the origin of which is far from clear. I*
might be related to in- ‘to be’, the most convincing explanation so far.
(IT 17 ii 15-16)
i-san-en-appa                     nodu noki-n-ka
know-3PLPRETIISUB-IRR-for         Lord glory-GEN-OBJ
istauros-ildo _ olliri-men-disana-c[in]
Cross-upon        = hang-NEG-PLINDFUTPRET-for
“for if they had known, they would not have hanged upon the cross the Lord of Glory’It is interesting to note that irrealis marker -en follows the tense/aspect/person
suffix in the example above. In the consequent, the verb is marked as future
preterit.
    Browne (2002:89) compares -en to a form described as ‘electivum’ by Lepsius
(1880:113-114). According to Lepsius, this suffix is used in the preterit and
conveys the meaning of ‘I could have done it (if I had wanted to)’ which seems
to imply an irrealis. One example from the gospel is
                                                                                                           191
(GM 14.5)
janoos-een-kos-san       —_ denaar_=imil-tusko-logo
sell-IRR-PERF-3PLPRET      denar    hundred-three-formeskiin wee-kuu-g__       tir-oo-j-een-kossan
poor    one-PL-OB)        give-DIR-PLOBJ-IRR-PERF-3PLPRET
‘for this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and the money given to the
poor’Although Lepsius lists complete paradigms for the present and perfect given to
him by his informants, there is unfortunately only this singular example for this
type of construction in the texts. Contrary to the order of elements in Oid Nobiin,
-een here precedes the tense/aspect/person markers in Modern Nobiin.
    There is one additional example for an irrealis construction in Old Nobiin
which seems to be a predicative periphrastic:
(IT 1412-3)
iri _ inno du-ar-en-kan                      an ennal   di-men-dra-lo
you   here be-PREDPRETI-be-3SGCOND           my brother dic-NEG-PREDOFUT-EMPH
‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died’In the consequent, the future is used which conveys the literal meaning of ‘will
not die’.
    In addition to Lepsius’ ‘electivum’ as a corresponding way of expressing an
irrealis in Modern Nobiin, it is expressed by the endings of the conditional fol-
 lowing the perfect marker in the protasis. In the apodosis, the innovated future is
 followed by the suffixes of the preterit resulting in a future preterit, as in
 ‘Erm 16)
 y0-loni          aiga    ed-oo-ko-kani                 ai   ikka   in-nekini   ahsen-ga

 IFUT-serve-ISGPRET       you-and    IFUT-love-1SGPRET
 ‘if your father marries me | will serve you better than this and I will love you’ 11.3.2 Purpose ClausesThere are several ways of constructing a purpose clause in Old Nobiin. If the
subject of the clause is identical to the subject of the main clause the element
-inia or one of its variants -ania/-enua/-inua/-unua is suffixed to the verb.'* The '8 Browne (2002:90ff.) calls this construction “non-personal final clause”.","[188, 189, 190, 191, 192]"

1. Introduction
 It is not often that we can observe language change in a language over a period
of more than one thousand years. Nobiin-Nubian seems to be the only language
belonging to the Nilo-Saharan phylum where this is possible. The present study
analyzes language change in Nobiin over a period of about a millennium. This
analysis is based on textual data from the older stage of Nobiin written in the
medieval period between the 8th and the 15th centuries, called Old Nobiin
throughout this book, as well as present-day Nobiin, as it is known through the
work of scholars from the nineteenth century onward until the latest grammatical
and lexical studies of Werner (1987) and Khalil (1996), called Modern Nobiin
here.
     A few introductory notes on terminology seem to be indicated at this point.
The Nobiin language was and is spoken in a region called Nubia. The geographi-
cal term, which will frequently be used in this study, comprises the area of As-
wan around the Ist Cataract in the north (see map) and the region around ed-
Debba between the 34 and 4th Cataracts in the south. This means that the north-
ernmost part of Nubia lies in the modern country of Egypt but the greatest part of
Nubia belongs to present-day Sudan. Traditionally, the region between the Ist and
2nd Cataracts was referred to as “Lower Nubia” and the region south of it as
“Upper Nubia”, with the Batn el-Hajar or kid-n-tu “Belly of Stones” as a stretch
of the Nile difficult to pass as a natural barrier in between the two divisions. The
construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s brought about dramatic
changes for the Nubian people and the region. People were relocated in regions
far from their original homes and great parts of Lower Nubia were flooded. At
the same time, the construction project led to the first collaborative international
rescue effort involving UNESCO. The so-called “Nubia Campaign” aimed at
salvaging the archaeological sites threatened by the Aswan High Dam. Most of
the Old Nobiin texts which served as a basis for the grammatical analyses in this
book were found in the course of several archaeological campaigns conducted
during the “Nubia Campaign”.
    Throughout this book, the chronological and historical category “medieval pe-
riod” is repeatedly used. “Medieval period” or “Middle Ages” usually designate
a period in European history mostly dated from the fall of the Western Roman
                                                                                          os nat adoro al
Empire in the 5% century until about the end of the 15th/early           16 century,
amongst other things marked by the beginning of European overseas expansion.
As part of the European historical periodization, the term “medieval period” and
the concept behind it cannot and should not easily and uncritically be transferred
and applied to the history of non-European regions. Early scholars of Nubian
languages and history used the designation “Christian Nubia” for the period after
the “fall” of the Meroitic Empire and a short “Dark Age” and before the final
Islamization of Nubia, i. e. between the 6th and the 14th/]5th centuries. As late as
2002, Welsby divides the history of Nubia along traditional terms as “Pagan”, a
term which is not only biased, but also pejorative, “Christian”, and “Muslim”.
This tripartition suggests that history happens in events at identifiable dates and
that religion is the defining factor for the periodization of history.
     In this book, the designation “medieval period” is mainly used for the era
 when Old Nobiin was a written language in Nubia. As the oldest document is
 dated to 787 and the youngest to 1484 this compasses a period of about 700
 years. In the appendix dealing with written sources, this period is expanded to
 nearly a millennium because it includes and critically assesses the work of Chris-
 tian historiographers on Nubia which starts as early as the 6th century. So it
 seems justified to talk about the Medieval Period or the Medieval Millennium
                                                                                             osises Sines
 without referring to religious categories or transferring European periodization to
 Nubia. Nubia had “its own” medieval period in history which was characterized
  by a highly organized kingdom interacting with its southern, eastern, western and
  northern neighbors—of different religious affiliation—and also with the Byzan-
  tine Empire outside the African continent.
      The older stage of the language analyzed in this study has been known as
  “Old Nubian” for about a century. Although it is still used by scholars of the
  various Nubian languages, this designation is not adequate and appears anti-
  quated, not the least because Nubian is the name of a language family consisting
  of different subgroups of languages not mutually intelligible. The language
  called “Old Nubian”, however, doesn’t represent an early stage of the whole
  language family but of only one of its members, the Nobiin language, which is
  moreover isolated within the family (Bechhaus-Gerst 1984/85, 1990, 1996). To
 call this language “Old Nubian” is at least as misleading as would be calling
 “Old English” “Old Germanic” which nobody would ever think of. One reason
 for the misleading designation lies in the history of Nubian studies. For a long
 time, only the Nubian languages spoken in the Nile Valley were known to Euro-
 pean scholars. They automatically assumed a closer genetic relationship between
 these “Nile Nubian” languages which only later turned out to be not the case.
 When the first pieces of medieval literature were discovered, the writing was
 deciphered and the linguistic affiliation was identified, it seemed natural to call it
 12
Old Nubian, although Griffith (1913:68) in the first comprehensive editing of the
then known texts remarked that “the agreement with the Fadija-Mahass dialect
 [= today’s Nobiin] as opposed to the Kenzi-Dongolese dialect is very clearly
marked”. It is recommended here that the term “Old Nubian” should be alto-
gether abandoned in favor of the more accurate “Old Nobiin”.
     The present study is not a work of linguistic theory but it also doesn’t restrict
 itself to mere descriptions of different language states. It tries to reveal processes
of language change and grammaticalization from Old to Moder Nobiin but also
within Old and Modern Nobiin respectively. Although the development and
changes in the nominal and pronominal systems are discussed, the focus was put
on the verbal morphology and syntax. Nevertheless, this book can only represent
the beginning of the study of language change in Nobiin. In 1991, the mentor of
Old Nobiin studies, the late G. Michael Browne, expressed what he regarded as
desiderata of future scholarly work. On top of his list he posted the need for a
diachronic grammar which would treat the relationship between Old and Modern
Nobiin but also diachronic patterns within Old Nobiin. This study hopefully is a
first step towards this end. As most of the work on Old Nobiin has been done by
classical scholars and the texts are available only in non-transcribed and non-
segmented form, the numerous examples from the texts may also serve to inter-
est scholars with different backgrounds for the interesting subject of language
change in Nobiin.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

 6.6 Interrogative There is no complete paradigm of the interrogative documented                         in Old Nobiin
 although we would expect a fully developed paradigm if we look at Modern
 Nobiin. According to Browne (2002:66), interrogative sentences can end in:
 “i         2™ person singular in all examples
 -ha        one example 1* person singular and 3™ person singular respectively The suffixes follow the verb/predicate and personal endings. The question can be
 introduced by an interrogative pronoun, such as is- or mina (for interrogative
 pronouns see 4.4). The terminal particle is optional and can be dropped.
 (M. 9.1)
 anki-min-na-i
 remember-NEG-2SGPRESIND-INTERROG
  ‘don’t you remember?’  An interrogative pronoun can be placed at the beginning of the sentence or
  clause, as in
  (NC 26.10-12)
  mina iru    till-ilogoian    —_ daui-na-i
  what you     god-than           be great-2SGPRESIND-INTERROG
  ‘what? are you greater than god?’
      100
Although the interrogative pronoun is there it is not a wh-type question but a
yes-no one. Second person singular -i seems to be part of a regular interrogative
paradigm which is still present in Modern Nobiin (see below). Suffix -ha, how-
ever, listed by Browne under the same heading is not part of that paradigm. In
the two instances documented, it follows interrogative pronouns, thus addition-
ally marking wh-type questions, as in
(M. 8.14-15)

“where was it?’
(ITII 16iii 9-12)
iskaragra-ha [...]           pal-di-re
how-INTERROG [...]           go forth-FUT-ISGPRESIND
‘how will I go forth?’In Modern Nobiin we find two paradigms                               for the interrogative which   Werner
(1987:153) labels interrogative I and II. Interrogative I has a suffix -i for the
2nd person and seems to correspond to the Old Nobiin form. The suffixes of the
interrogative are:
                       Interrogative I Present                Interrogative I] Present

words. Lepsius (1880:102ff.) and Abel (1913:39) document slightly different
forms. Lepsius calls his second paradigm a contracted variant of the first. The
paradigms are:

the other paradigm with wh-type questions. The following sentences exemplify:

respond to those documented by Werner (1987:154ff.):

5. The Verb — Introduction
To this day, the most convincing analysis of the basis of the Old Nobiin verbal
system is the one developed by Browne (1982:11ff. and later). As his analysis
helps to understand what will be described in the following chapters on the verb,
it has to a certain extent to be presented here. Browne reduced the verbal system
to four basic forms which he named differently over the years. In his older work,
he spoke of “infinitives” meaning a verbal noun. Later, he preferred the term
“verbids” in reference to Jespersen’s (1924) creation. On the basis of numerous
examples from the texts edited by him, Browne demonstrated that these forms
function as verbal substantives as well as verbal adjectives (ibid., 23;
 1991:288ff.). Hintze (1989:VII) opposed this terminology and called the forms
“participles” as did Stricker (1940:443ff.) before him. He was positive about a
clear formal and syntactic difference between infinitive and participle. Browne
(1991:88) countered by demonstrating that Hintze’s “infinitive” is actually a
reduced form of his “participle”. In retrospective, the discussion between Hintze
and Browne seems to have been rather about terminology instead of function.
The forms under consideration here are non-finite forms of the verb with a wide
range of functions. To simplify matters they will be called “participle” through-
out this book.
    Old Nobiin exhibits four participles distinguished by tense/aspect:
Present        -il/-el
Preterit I     -ol(-al 7)
Preterit II    -sil
Future         -aril/-dilThe actual meaning and function of these forms will be discussed in the follow-
ing chapters.
   In Modern Nobiin, three of the four participles are preserved:
Present        -i(i)
Preterit       -0(0)
Preterit (7)   -siinThe present and preterit participles are reduced forms of the old ones. The old
preterit II participle is a more complicated form and has to be discussed. Accord-
                                                                                63
ing to Werner, it is different from the other two particles tonally in that the first
two are neutral with regard to tone and adapt to the tonal structure of the verb,
but -siin is marked by high tone. Werner regards the final consonant -n as a mod-
ern correspondence to Old Nobiin -/ which actually is documented in several
instances. Another explanation would interpret -siin as originating in an ex-
panded participle -si/-n. This form is a genitive which is used absolutely, i. e.
without following postposition, constructed in analogy to subjunctive forms.
Lepsius wrongly calls the form infinitive of the aorist and distinguishes it from
the participles. -siin functions as a passive participle in Modern Nobiin according
to Werner (1987:197). The following examples from the Ermenne narrative con-
tradict Werner’s proposition:
(Erm. 21)
ed-00-siin-ani                sabahiye-ga       _ideni    medid-ee-ka           aw-00s-a
marry-DIR-PART-GEN            moming-at         woman     porridge-one-OB)      make-DIR-ADJ
‘The next moming, after he had married, the woman made porridge’
(Erm. 17)

his-father-GEN         evening-at    waterwheel-from      come-PART-after       say-BEN-3SGPRET
‘After his father had come from the waterwheel in the evening, he said to him’Obviously, the two sentences do not contain passive constructions. Instead, -siin
seems to be a past perfect participle in both cases. A relation between a past
situation and an even earlier situation is expressed. Also in both instances the
results of the earlier actions—marriage and arrival of the father—still hold at the
time of the second situation. The difference between -siin and -o(o) becomes
evident in the next example from the Ermenne narrative:
(Erm. 144)
fal-o-juu-o-goni                            urraak-tenni-la_—s      murti-g     iiga-tir-on
go Out-PARTPRET-g0-PARTPRET-and             beginning-their-at      horse-OBJ   say-give-3SGPRET
‘and walking away in front of them he said to his horse’Here, -o suffixed to the first verb marks the background to the action introduced
by the second verb. At the same time, simultaneous action is indicated. Both
events are located in the past.
    A past perfect also seems to be indicated by the following bible quotation:
(GM 2.15)
noog        tan-naa_      sufra-la__tiig-siin            wagti-gaa      mekkaas-ii-goon        aib-ii-goon
house _ his-in            table-at   sit down-PART       _time-at       tax collector-PL-and   sinner-PL-and
aagi-san       sufra-1_   Iesuu-goon     talaamiid-ii   tanguu-goon-dani
Sit-3PLPRET _ table-at Jesus-and          disciple-PL_his-and-with
‘at that time he had sat down at the table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners sat with Jesus
and his disciples’Although this example might not be as clear-cut as the ones before, the sequence
of events has Jesus sitting down first and the other joining him while he is still
sitting there.
    It can be concluded that Modern Nobiin still has two suffixes for past partici-
ples with different function. Contrary to Werner’s opinion, the Old Nobiin differ-
entiation between preterit I and II has not completely disappeared in present-day
Nobiin. That does not exclude that one of these was used in passive construc-
tions. It has already been pointed out (Werner 1987:199) that alternation between
transitivity and intransitivity is quite common in Sudanic languages.","[61, 62, 63, 64, 65]"

others and is difficult to explain. It is interesting to note that the endings based on                                     ;
-ko- which were predominant in Old Nobiin have completely disappeared. From
the plural endings, it can be deduced that the construction with -/o formed the
basis of the modern forms. In Werner’s paradigm, forms are even more reduced.
    Werner (1987:161) presents a second paradigm for the conditional which dif-                                             f|
fers in the 1st person singular and 1st and 2™ plural and has no correspondence in                                           f                                                                                                                            f
Old Nobiin. Only Reinisch (ibid.) lists -kega as 1st person singular alternative                                            f
                                                                                                                            |

-kaye which he lists as Fadijja. The forms are:

either the imperative or the so-called innovated future/intentional (see below
chapter 10.5). It has been mentioned above that Old Nobiin had an optional addi-
tional marker which introduced a conditional clause, alesin ‘truly’. In Modern
Nobiin, is has been replaced by the optional particle -on/-lon ‘if? suffixed to the
subject of the protasis, so that a double marking is still possible.
   In Modern Nobiin, the endings of the conditional can also follow the perfect
with -ko/-kun. In the Ermenne narrative, we find the following example:
 (Erm 4)
 ai-loni     junt-an-oo-ko-kaiye                             tood-ee-koon-unn-oo-ko-kaiyeei

 Shatirhassan-OBJ           _IFUT-call-1SGPRET-[...] ‘if | become pregnant and deliver a son, I will call him Shatirhassan [...]’ The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘if | have become pregnant and have deliv-
 ered a son, I will have called him Shatirhassan’. The function of these construc-
 tions with the past can be deduced discussing the following dialogue between
  Shatirhassan and his father. The two sentences are consecutive in the text.

   ‘his father said to him: “o my son, if I marry this woman she will become a stepmother for you””   Abel (1913:13ff.) gives a rather convincing explanation of the difference in
   meaning between the two constructions. The present and future are used in the
   father’s answer because it is certain that the woman will become the boy’s step-
   108
mother as an outcome of the marriage. That the two will be better off after the
marriage, as the boy suggests, is, however, far from certain. Thus, according to
Abel, the past is used. What Abel describes is the difference between a real con-
dition and an irrealis. The father’s statement presents a real condition, because a
certainty is expressed, the event is taking place. By contrast, the son’s prediction
consists of an irrealis. As the development of the story shows, the situation of the
son deteriorates, because his stepmother tries to kill him. In the light of this de-
velopment, some of the promises made by his father’s new wife are unreal in that
they are blatant lies. They are therefore marked as irrealis, as in
(Erm 16)
ibo-loni         aiga   ed-oo-ko-kani                ai   ikka   in-nekini   ahsen-ga

IFUT-serve-ISGPRET      you-and      IFUT-love-1SGPRET
‘if your father marries me, I will serve you better than this and | will love you’The examples show that in Modern Nobiin real and unreal conditions can be
expressed and morphologically distinguished. Real conditions are characterized
by the endings of the conditional in the protasis and the endings of imperative or
innovated future which takes the suffixes of the present in the apodosis. In the
irrealis, the endings of the conditional follow the perfect marker in the protasis,
and in the apodosis, the innovated future is followed by the suffixes of the pret-
erit resulting in a future preterit. The first construction resembles those of real
conditions in Old Nobiin presented above. Whether the irrealis was expressed
accordingly in the old stage of the language has so far been left open. It seems
that there are only three instances of an irrealis documented in the texts. One of
these examples comes from Qasr Ibrim:
(IT 17 ii 15-16)
i-san-en-appa                 nodu    nok-in-ka     istauros-ildo _ ollir-imen-di-sana-sin
know-3PLPRETIISUB-?-for       Lord    glory-GEN-OBJ cross-upon —_ hang-NEG-FUT-3PLPRETII-EMPH
“for if they had known, they would not have hanged upon the cross the Lord of Glory’The apodosis has the endings of the old future followed by the suffixes of the
preterit II indicative, comparable to the construction in Modern Nobiin presented
above. The protasis differs in that the verb is preterit I] subjunctive which is in
accordance with its status as subordinate clause marked by -appa ‘for’. This
might be due to the fact that contrary to the examples of Modern Nobiin where
the events and actions described are in the future at the time of speaking and still
an—if unlikely—possibility, the event described in the Old Nobiin example is no
longer possible because at the time of speaking, a different course of action has
                                                                                                109
already been taken. In Old Nobiin, an additional element -en is inserted which
seems to be documented in only one other non-restorated instance:
(IT 1412-3)
iri    inno duar[a?)en-kan an         ennal          di-me-dra-lo
you    here   be-PRED-?-3SGCOND       my brother     die-NEG-FUT-PRED-EMPH
‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died (lit.: ‘will not die’)This example has the 3% person conditional -kan in the position of -appa in the
example before. Although the past is not morphologically marked, the sentence
is an irrealis in the same way as has been found before. The events described
refer to a possibility which existed in the past.
      Browne compares the element -en with Lepsius’ (1880:113—114) marker of a
so-called electivum. According to Lepsius, it is mostly used with the preterit, and
from his examples it actually seems to be a form of the irrealis. Although Lepsius
lists paradigms for the present and perfect with -en, there seems unfortunately to
be only one instance in the texts:
(GM 14.5)
janoos-een-kos-san denaar       imil-tusko-logo        meskiin      wee-kuu-g__   tir-oo-j-een-kos-san

 the Old Nobiin examples above. The evidence, however, is too scarce for both
 Old and Modern Nobiin, to draw any conclusion. It can only be said that an ele-
 ment -en seems to have existed already at the Old Nobiin stage which marked an
 irrealis, but seldom used. More on conditional clauses will be presented and
 discussed in chapter 11 on syntax.","[106, 107, 108, 109, 110]"

phatic conjugation”) as going back to predicative -a suffixed to the endings of
the subjunctive. Browne (1981:61; 1989a:23) reconstructs the following assimi-
lation processes which resulted in the suffixes of the indicative:
                Subjunctive                                     Indicative

3PL                -an                     +          a          -anaThe present personal endings of Modern Nobiin originate in those of the Old
Nobiin present indicative/subjunctive. Only the second persons singular and
plural are different and have to be innovations. They are not restricted to the
present but are also used in the past and with different aspects. They are, how-
ever, not found with the interrogative present and preterit, the conditional and the
so-called affirmative. The innovations were presumably caused by the ambigu-
ous forms for the 24/3 person singular and Is'/24 plural of Old Nobiin and
were meant to restore unambiguousness. The origin of these innovated personal
endings is obscure. They were not borrowed from another Nubian contact lan-
guage or Arabic and must therefore be explained by an internal development of
Nobiin. It has been indicated by Werner (1987:147) that they also differ tonally
from other personal endings in that they alone have high tone, whereas the end-
 ings of the 1st and 34 persons have low tone. Although not all the relevant
 tenses/aspects have been discussed yet, the innovated forms are listed here:
 Present                 SG                    -nam             PL      -rokom
 Preterit                SG                    -onam            PL      -sokom
 Future/Intentional      SG                    -aanam/-diinam   PL      -allokom/-dillokom Compared to the Old Nobiin forms, it becomes evident that the additional ele-
 ments -m in the singular and -kom in the plural were suffixed to the personal
 endings of the indicative. As nasal -m is found in the singular as well as in the
 plural, -ko must be some kind of 24 person plural marker. If we look for a possi-
 ble origin of these endings one of the Old Nobiin copulative constructions seems
 to be a likely candidate. In the so-called ‘indicative copulative’ (Browne
  1989:29) the postposition -ma, in which the vowel a is often deleted, is attached
 to the indicative. -7(a) has the function to topicalize the preceding verb, e. g.
 kim-mis-so-m                         Di-mis-so-ma
 €at-NEG-IPLPRETIIND-INDCOP           drink-NEGI PLPRETIIIND-INDCOP
  ‘is it we did not eat, is it we did not drink [...]?’  The topic marker might have become part of the personal endings of the second
  persons and its original function was lost. The origin of -ko plural is more difficult
  to determine, because there is no exact corresponding plural marker in Old Nobiin.
  In the predicative copulative and the so-called vetitive, there is a particular pro-
  nominal element -ke denoting the 2"" person plural. Zyhlarz (1928:105) proposed
  that this element developed into the plural marker -ko of the innovated endings by
  way of vowel harmony. As the preceding personal endings all show a vowel -o this  76
is not to be dismissed. The process would have been present -ro-ke-m —> -rokom,
past -so-ke-m —» -sokom, and future/intentional -allo-ke-m —> -allokom. Although
this reconstruction is probable, the problem remains that no traces of the process
can be found          in Old Nobiin. This can indicate a recent innovation which took
place after the Old Nobiin script was abandoned.
   In Modern Nobiin, the forms listed are used in main as well as complement/
subordinate clauses.
   Taking a look at the contexts in which the present is used without any other
aspectual marking, we find examples like the following:
(IT II, 36, 14-16)
yaggi      kinn-lo              neuesi     adama-de        anenikol-ideke-n      as-ka

this document, and the house itself which is included’In the first example, the classical function of the present is documented. The
action of selling land and house is in progress at the time of speaking or—in this
case—at the time of writing the contract.
(IT III, 55 ii 1-2)
Parre anni-do          uru-ka            og-ire-lo                     mon-ina

‘I call the king to my land. He is reluctant.’
(CRN, 11, 4-5)

this     rock-upon      build-ISGPRESIND)            my _ church-OB)
‘[You are Peter;] upon this rock I build my church.’The second and third examples come from a personal letter from the Qasr Ibrim
corpus and from the more formal religious/theological Chrysostomus Nubianus.
The second is similar in its use of the present but seems to be more in line with a
general imperfective meaning. In the third example, the function as imperfective
is even more obvious because this quotation from Matthew 16,18 is usually
translated as future or intentional: ‘Upon this rock I will build my church’.
   As expected the simple present is only rarely used in the narratives of Modern
Nobiin but often found in the isolated sentences recorded by the various authors.","[73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"

 12. General Conclusions on Language Change in
      Nobiin
Although Modern Nobiin has much in common with its predecessor Old Nobiin
the language changed in significant ways in the course of about a millennium.
This does not come as a surprise, as language change is a permanent process not
least dependent on the social and political changes its speakers undergo in the
course of time. At all times, Nubia was a region where a multitude of languages
were spoken and written, a multi-lingual contact zone where different factors
influenced language use, language change, and also language shift.
   The creation of a written form of Old Nobiin, which was used in different
contexts such as church, political administration, economic transactions and the
personal sphere, is evidence of an highly organized political structure. It also
seems to have been one important means of constructing a Nobiin identity be-
cause at that time, the Nobiin already had two written languages, Greek and
Coptic, at their disposal. As on the one hand the oldest manuscript preserved
dates back to the end of the 8h century and written sources on the other hand
indicate that the Nobiin had been the dominant political force in Nubia from at
least the 6th century onwards, one has to ask for the reason why the Nobiin want-
ed a written form of their mother tongue at exactly that time. Written sources
from neither inside nor outside Nubia give an answer to that question. We can
only speculate that the period under consideration was a relatively peaceful one
which allowed for such a process. At the same time, the advancing Arab/Moslem
neighbors north of Nubia might have created an urgent necessity to construct and
assure a Nobiin identity. Political and religious changes finally led to the disap-
pearance of written Nobiin at the end of the 15th century. A Nobiin identity seems
to have no longer been sought after.
   The multi-lingual setting of medieval Nubia was the main factor in triggering
language change as it was described in this study. Between the 6th and the 13th cen-
tury Old Nobiin, as the language of the royal house, the administration, and also of
religion, was of high prestige which was certainly important to acquire knowl-
edge of for all those who spoke other languages as their mother tongue. First and
foremost, the speakers of Nubian Dongolese/Kenzi have to be mentioned here
                                                                                 217
which were settling in the Nubian Nile Valley as neighbors of and amongst the
Nobiin from the 4"") century onwards.
   It has been pointed out before (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996) that Modern Nobiin in a
way looks like a reduced or “simplified” version of its earlier stage. This devel-
opment can be explained by large numbers of people who spoke Old Nobiin as
second language but often had only imperfect knowledge of the language. Their
“mistakes” entered spoken Nobiin, a process which can to some extent be ob-
served in the documentary texts of Old Nobiin. This process probably intensified
when the language lost its status as quasi-official language.
   As has been shown, changes have been most prominent in verbal morphology
and morpho-syntax. The following features of Old Nobiin have been lost or are
only present in reduced or non-productive form:
 1. the subjunctive as morphological marker of a subordinate or complement
        clause
       . the predicative construction
AWN
       . the periphrastic constructions
       . the distinction between preterit I + II
       . the admirative
ONAN
       . the predicative copulative
       . the copulative constructions with -m(a), -me and -so
       . the emphatic particles -sin and -/o
 These constructions were not actually replaced in Modern Nobiin but formative
 possibilities were reduced especially where mere stylistic alternatives were em-
 ployed in Old Nobiin. The most important innovations in verbal morphology or
 morpho-syntax         were   based   on   verbal   complexes   which   gave   rise   to   new
 tense/aspect/mode forms. In some cases, the beginning of the process of gram-
 maticalization of independent verbs could be observed in Old Nobiin. New for-
 mations include the innovated future/intentional, the new habitual/imperfective,
 the durative/resultative, and the perfect(ive).
    Corresponding to these processes, main clauses in Modern Nobiin can no
 longer take either a predicative or indicative depending on the necessity to
 overtly mark person and number but take the one formation which remained.
 Likewise, the morphologically marked distinction between main and subordi-
 nate/complement clause was lost. This reduction also affected other construc-
 tions such as the conditional or the formation of relative clauses.
     It can be concluded that Old and Moder Nobiin are still closely related but
 that the modern variant is a result of language change through interference from
 non-Nobiin languages and their speakers.","[216, 217, 218]"

                          The initial vowel as well as -r- may be dropped. The predicative preterit II would
                          have been -isira, but is not documented. There is a preterit II form -isa which is
                          only used in attributive constructions (Browne 2002:50).
                                 Besides the indicative, the predicative can occur in a verbal sentence. As per-
                          son and number are not marked with predicative forms, it can only be used if the
                          subject is expressed or understood within the context. Examples are innumerable
                          in the religious as well as documentary texts. Some of them are presented below:                          Predicative Present

EEEEEEeEeEeEaEEeEVw~Es~
                          In Modern Nobiin, some remnants of the formerly widespread predicative -a are
                          found. In a nominal sentence, the noun which functions as predicate is still
                          marked by -a, but it is followed by men- ‘to be’ marked for tense/aspect and
                                                                                                                                        69

person. This construction corresponds to the one from Old Nobiin mentioned
above under 3. ‘nominal predicate + in- ‘to be”. Only in the 3""4 person singular,
the verb can optionally be dropped (Werner 1987:203). The resulting construc-
tions resemble to the nominal sentence of Old Nobiin:
(Wemer 1987:203)

this      man-PRED
‘this is a man’ (ibid.)In Abel’s Ermenne narrative and the gospel according to Mark, we find examples
of the construction with men-:
(Erm. 26)

 ‘being a gift’.

 the 3d person singular, as the following example shows:

The predicative as one of the verbal forms in a verbal sentence has completely
disappeared. In connection with verbs, only the adjunctival function of -a was
preserved. In this function, it is still found in verb strings or verbal complexes
where it is suffixed to all but the last verb which takes the tense/aspect and per-
son markers,Excurse 1: Indicative and SubjunctiveIt has been mentioned before that Old Nobiin had indicative as well as sub-
junctive forms. Indicative and subjunctive are rather traditional labels which
might no longer be generally understood in the sense they were used within the
framework of Old Nobiin grammar. Therefore, some explanations seem neces-
sary, as—to hopefully simplify matters—this distinction is maintained in this
book. As presumably generally known, indicative and subjunctive belong to the
grammatical    category of mood.    Palmer (2006?:5) discusses the difference be-
tween indicative/subjunctive on the one hand and realis/irrrealis on the other
hand. Although both may express the distinction between the notional features of
realis and irrrealis, there are differences in their distribution and syntactic func-
tion. A characteristic feature of the subjunctive is that it is found mainly in sub-
ordinate clauses. Palmer furthermore mentions that the indicative/subjunctive
system usually occurs with the tense systems, a feature which does not apply to
the realis/irrealis system. He discusses a wide range of different subordinate o
complement clauses which are marked by the subjunctive in various language:
of the world (ibid., 107-144). Most of his categories have, however, no relevance
for the use of the subjunctive in Old Nobiin.
   Jespersen (1924:314) noted that the subjunctive may simply have the function
of being subordinate and therefore is typically the mood used in subordinate
clauses. Palmer (ibid., 142ff.) agrees with Jespersen’s assumptions and stresses
that the subjunctive sometimes lacks any motivation of irrealis. He gives exam-
ples from Latin where the use of the subjunctive increasingly concentrated on
marking subordination in general or to distinguish between different kinds of
subordinate clauses.
    With regard to Old Nobiin, the first grammar by Zyhlarz (1928:59) distin-
guished   between   an   emphatic/finite   and   a subjunctive/infinite   conjunction.
Browne (1982 and more) replaces emphatic with indicative but otherwise agrees
with Zyhlarz’ general interpretation of the verbal system. Both authors regard the
subjunctive as one of the forms of the verb in subordinate clauses, the other one
being the participle. Browne’s thorough analyses has shown that both forms are                                                                                    71
verbal nouns distinguished by the overt expression of person and number in the
subjunctive which       is missing with the participle. Although     in some        instances
irrealis features might be involved, they are by no means predominant or even
important. First and foremost, the subjunctive in Old Nobiin is a subordinator
used in all kinds of complement clauses without any notion of irrealis, the main
factor being the necessity to express person and number.                       .
   Correspondingly, the term indicative refers to the form of the verb in main
clauses if person and number have to be expressed. Otherwise, parallel to the
participle in complement clauses, the predicative is used in main clauses.
   All authors writing on Modern Nobiin also dealt with the question of the exis-
tence of a subjunctive in the language. Lepsius and Reinisch who had no knowl-
edge of Old Nobiin came to different conclusions. Reinisch (1879:82) lists a
paradigm for the subjunctive in Modern Nobiin which mainly differs from the
indicative in the absence of the innovated second person singular and plural (see
below chapter 6.1). There are, however, no convincing examples in his texts.
Lepsius obviously wasn’t aware of a subjunctive in Nobiin and ignores it com-
pletely. In his comment on Reinisch’s grammar (1880:477) he points to the fact
that no examples are given and that his informants are ignorant of the forms.
Eighty years later, Abel (1921:3) describes the old subjunctive of Nobiin as about
to disappear. Another sixty years later, Werner (1987:192) recorded the remains
of a subjunctive paradigm which only shows up when followed by the postposi-
 tion -faan ‘until’. It is no longer productive and the comparison with Abel’s
 paradigm reveals that in the 2nd and 3% person singular, the personal endings
 were either lost and replaced by the suffix of the Infinitive -e, as Werner (ibid.)
 suggests, or simply reduced from -en to -e. Neither in the singular nor in the
 plural, the innovated suffixes of the 2.4 person are found.

 with Abel’s paradigm of the subjunctive is that it looks like the indicative minus
 the innovated 2""4 persons. That there actually are remnants of the old subjunctive
 in Modern Nobiin is most obvious in Wemer’s 1st person singular and 1st and
 2d person plural where even the ambiguous forms of the Old Nobiin subjunctive
 are preserved. If the attempt at reconstructing the innovated personal endings is
 72
at least partly correct (see below) it is consistent that they are missing in the
subjunctive. The indicative copulative -m(a) never follows a verb in the subjunc-
tive in Old Nobiin (see chapter 9.5). A much simpler explanation would argue
with the status of the subjunctive as disappearing as a productive paradigm at the
time of the innovation of the 2     person ending which was only preserved      in
fixed paradigms like the so-called ‘subjunctive with -faan’.
   To summarize these excursive remarks it can be emphasized that the terms in-
dicative/subjunctive are maintained in this book basically referring to morpho-
logically distinct verb forms in Old Nobiin found in main and subordinate/com-
plement clauses. How these combine with various tense/aspect constructions will
be discussed in the respective chapters. In Modern Nobiin, the morphologically
marked distinction is lost, but looking at the endings (see below) it is far from
obvious whether these represent reduced endings of the old indicative or whether
the old subjunctive was generalized and also used instead of the original forms.
Definitely, predicative -a, which was characteristic of Old Nobiin indicative, is
missing in Modern Nobiin.","[68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73]"

         A double relative marked as object is found in the following example from a
     sales contract:
     (IT III 40, 14-15)
     parre     kapop-in           jan-a          dis-sil              ir-aula        pi-l

     Udji-below       lie-PARTPRES-OBJ     “(I) sold Kapopi’s land which is within my power and which lies in Lower Udji’     As referent, the demonstrative pronoun in ‘this’ can be added which results in a
     kind of subtype of type 3 above:
    4. noun + demonstrative + participle/subjunctive
       salu.  in pes-in
           word    this say-3SGPRESSUB
           ‘the word which he says’ = lit.: ‘the word this he says”    As the demonstrative pronouns generally precede their noun in- seems to actu-
    ally function as a relative pronoun in these constructions. The following example
    is from a documentary text from Qasr Ibrim:
—   (IT IIL 33, 8-9)
    in        doll-en-gul-lo               dui-I-la
    this      wish-PRESPART-PL-EMPH_       be-PART-from
    ‘he is amongst those who wish’    According to Browne (2002:84), a relative clause introduced by in- is either
    individually definite or typically general. The example above belongs to the
    latter category. The literal meaning is ‘being from those wishing’. The pronomi-
    nal referent is understood, but not expressed.
        In all types described above, we find either the participle or the subjunctive in
    the relative clause. There are, however, additional constructions which employ
    the predicative or even the indicative in the relative clause. This becomes neces-
    sary if the referent is also marked as predicative. The following variants can be
    distinguished:
    5. noun-PRED + (noun-OB)) + predicative
           cit-a       sak-ka    _—pes-ra

     sal-a         pes-na
     word-PRED     say-3SGPRESIND
     “the word which he says’ = lit.: ‘(it) is the word he says’The first example comes from the ‘Miracle of St. Menas’ and shall be explained
in detail because it shows that the structure of sentences in the texts is actually
more complex than the formalized sentences show:
(M. 1.1-3)
nokkor-a          Xristosi-in    martyrosu     nissu mina-na       au-sa-lo
miracle-PRED      Christ-GEN     martyr        holy Mena-GEN       do-PREDPRETII-COP
‘it is a miracle which Mena, the holy martyr of Christ, did’The first part of the example above consists of a nominal sentence marked by
predicative -a. Browne (1997, and others) interprets final -/o as the postposition
functioning as a copula. As suffix -a is sufficient to mark a predicate, -/o can also
be interpreted as emphatic particle or focus marker. au-sa- is a predicative the
ending of which goes back to a preterit II participle -si/- plus predicative -a-. The
verb in the modifying clause is nominalized, and because of this its subject mina-
na is marked for genitive case. The sentence is an example of a restrictive rela-
tive clause where the relative or modifying clause restricts the referent, in this
 case the ‘miracle’, to a specific member of that class, in this case ‘which Mena
 did’. Browne (1994:22) classifies this type of construction as “attributive relative
 clause”. The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘(it) is a miracle the holy martyr of
 Christ Mena’s having done’.
      A noun connected with miffan ‘any, all’ has to take predicative -a. Accord-
 ingly, this also applies for relative clauses with mifJan as the following example
 from sales contract shows:
  IT III 36 i 15-16)
  varre in      sigerrin-na_—s   da-ra       miffan-ka   jan-a     te-ra
 land this document-in           be-PRED      all-OBJ    trade-ADJ give-PREDPRES
 ‘I sell all land which is in this document’ The relative clause is embedded between the referent and its modifier which is
 marked as object. In the main clause, the predicative is used because the subject
 is known and therefore mustn’t be marked at the main verb.
    A similar but slightly different construction is found in the next example from
 the miracle of Menas.","[208, 209, 210]"

religious interpretation, however, would assume that the marriages outlast the
death of the participating men and the woman.

   In the next example, it is more obvious that the action spoken about belongs
to the past and is concluded. The possessed man spoken about here is about to be
healed by Jesus:

perfect constructions in Old Nobiin when they were followed by the suffixes of
the present. Although there are only two examples with the preterit, a perfective
meaning is already indicated in these instances. In Modern Nobiin, verbal com-
plexes with kon-/kun-/ko- are restricted to the preterit. This restriction comes
along with a loss of the function of a perfect. The kon-/kun-/ko- complex func-
tions as a perfective in most of the examples above. That Werner failed to distin-
guish the formation from the preterit indicates a loss in functional differentiation
the endpoint of which was reached in the negative past where the complex with
kon-/kun-/ko- completely replaced the old preterit.","[174, 175, 176]"

‘after those went away on the road, he too mounted his lame horse and went away’According to Abel’s informant, the two sentences differ in that the second with
-(o)os emphasizes the people’s being completely outside or gone. Abel seems to
have missed that the second sentence alone contains two uses of fal-, one with
the other without -(o)os. In fact does the use of -ahara ‘after’ in the second ex-
ample show what the difference is about. The use of -(oJos in connection with
ahara in the first part of the sentence indicates that a completed action or resulta-
tive is marked. In the sequence of events, the going away of ‘those’ was com-
pleted before the going away of the main character of the story started.
    The grammar of Nobiin by Werner (1987:184) once more confirms the inabil-
 ity to infer a clear-cut function of the verbal complex with -(oJos. Werner con-
 fines himself to two observations: -(o)os in a verbal complex marks the “totality”
 of the action and therefore also means the complete execution of an action, i. €.
 the action belongs to the past. For this reason, the complex can only take the
 suffixes of the preterit, a statement which as has been shown does not apply.
    What has been proposed by different authors concerning the function and use
 of -(oJos in a verbal complex and what can be derived from the examples above
 can be summarized as follows: Use of -(o)os with Tenses and Aspects
 no restriction (Reinisch)
 No restriction, but mostly in the preterit and imperative (Lepsius)

 resultative or perfective                                                        no function discernible Verbal complexes with the verb -ed in Modern Nobiin have been treated in con-
 nection with -(o)os complexes by most of the aforementioned authors, although
  154
 in comparison they are still infrequent. -ed has undergone semantic change as an
 independent verb, as its meaning was reduced to ‘to marry (or take in marriage)’.
 Lepsius (1880:157) regarded the suffixation of -ed to another verb as insignifi-
 cant. He interpreted e. g., el- and eled- as indiscriminately signifying ‘to find’,
 nal- and naled- ‘to see’, etc.. In contrast to the -(oJos complex, the ed-complex
 was analyzed by him as wide-spread with the present or present participle and
 with the preterit. Reinisch (1879:54) stated that in use and meaning, complexes
 with -(o)os and -ed were identical. This assertion is rejected by Werner
 (1987:184ff.) who interprets -(oJos as more emphatic and -ed complex as syn-
 chronically more or less identical with the simple form. It can be used with the
 present but only with the preterit it occasionally obtains a meaning of “actual or
 factual happening of the action”. Abel (1913:76) interpreted the function of -ed
as intensifying the meaning of the simple verb. His translation of some exam-
ples, however, tells something else: for the verbs tu/b(e)- and oogire- which have
the meaning of ‘demand’ and ‘call’, the ed complexes tulb-ed- and oogr-ed are
formed which are both supposed to mean ‘to bring up, bring about’ (German
‘herbeiflihren’). Here, something like direction or directionality seems to be
indicated as can be seen by the German and English renditions ‘herbei’, ‘up’ and
‘about’. It is worthwhile to look at examples from the Ermenne text. Comparable
to the situation described for Old Nobiin, -ed is attached to other verbs denoting
‘to take’. In these instances, -ed still functions as directional:

‘well [said] the sultan, absorbed this contract in his inner self”Here, it is emphasized that the process of absorbing is directed towards the sul-
tan. The verb wudir- ‘to put, to lay’ obtains the meaning of ‘to put on (clothes)’

when it is used with -ed. The person who dresses is the reference point and again
-ed marks the direction towards it, as in
(Erm. 61)
wee-kon      udr-ed
one-and      put-DIR‘and one put on!’In other instances, it is more difficult to deduce a special function of the -ed
complex. In most of the cases, it seems to follow movement verbs, although the
direction of the movement is not necessarily the subject as reference point:

 ‘he trailed his gazelle (and) went to the village’ In the last example, tebbaiy ‘to seek’ is conceptualized as a movement verb in
 connection with the movement verbs ‘stand up’ and ‘come out’:

 ‘they stood up and came out and looked for the gazelle’ It can be summarized that -(o)os and -ed are documented                          in Old and Modem
 Nobiin as independent verbs with the meaning of ‘to pull out, to take out’ and ’to
 take, to marry’ respectively. They were used in verbal complexes following the
 adjunctive which could be deleted. In the course of the medieval Nobiin period, a
 functional split took place, as a result of which on the one hand the original func-
 tion and meaning was preserved, on the other hand a process of desemanticiza-
 tion and grammaticalization was initiated. Mostly in combination with motion or
 transfer verbs, -(oJos now               functions as directional marking         ‘movement away’
 from what might be called a deictic center. A deictic usage can also be found
 with -ed which mostly in combination with verbs meaning ‘to take’ or transfer
 verbs marks ‘movement towards’ a deictic center. As the examples show the
 deictic center is a point of reference which can be either animate or inanimate.
 There seem to be restrictions as to the use of tense and aspect with -(o)os and -ed
 at that stage. The further development can only be reconstructed on the basis of
  156
 Modern Nobiin. Another functional split must have taken place which might
 originally have been restricted to -(oJos. The directional was now used to empha-
 size the result or completion of an action. Werner’s statement that the resultative
 function logically entailed a restriction in the use of tense and aspect could not
 be corroborated. At the same time, an expansion must have taken place as to the
 verbs which can be used in an -(oJos complex. A restriction to motion and trans-
 fer verbs is no longer found. The deictic function may still have been productive
over a period of time but was more and more restricted. In Modern Nobiin, it is
only preserved in lexicalized form with the transfer verb jan- ‘to trade, to ex-
change’. With -ed, the further development is less evident. There seems to be an
analogous use as a completion or resultative marker in combination with the
preterit. It can, however, still be used with the present and Abel’s (see above)
translations suggest that at least at the beginning of the twentieth century ves-
tiges of the directional function were preserved. The problem of determining any
function of the verbal complexes with -(o)os and -ed which shows in all gram-
matical descriptions of Nobiin is evidence of the last stage in the development of
these complexes. The process of change can be reconstructed as
“directional”   —p   “definitive?   ——»    “resultative?   ——>     no functionwith the first to last existing simultaneously. The inflationary use of the two
elements with all kinds of verbs and in non-resultative contexts will finally result
in a complete semantic and functional loss, a process which is nearly completed.
It is interesting to note that the whole development from the Old Nobiin stage at
which only few examples of -(oJos- and -ed complexes with relatively clear-cut
function as directionals can be found to the more or less complete semantic and
functional loss took about seven hundred years. One mustn’t, however, mr
that we only know about the written language of the medieval period. In spoke’
Nobiin, the development will have been further progressed.","[153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"

and is built upon the subjunctive. The reduced participle is followed by -ko- (or
-ka-), the subjunctive formant is suffixed. In most instances, -/o is added which
                                                                                                         a
according to Browne (1997:21—24) is not the emphatic marker, but the locative.
With -/o initial -/ is often elided or assimilated (Browne 1987:27). If the subject
of protasis and apodosis is identical and unambiguously identifiable -ko-/-ka- is
directly followed by -/o. Otherwise, person and number are marked before -/o.
The following paradigm emerges:
                                                                                                                  ee
              -koeio          <       -ko-O-lo
Isc           -koio           <_     -ko-i-lo
2sG           -konno          <_     -ko-n-lo
3sG           -konno          =<__s-ko-n-lo             alternative form:             -kan(no)
IPL           -koouo          <_     -ko-ou-lo
2PL           -koouo          <_     -ko-ou-lo
3PL           -koanno         <_     -ko-an-lo                                        -kauan(no)
                                                                                                             te aman
                                                                                                         ~ pen
Although -kan(no) marks the 3"" person singular it alternates with -en, a form
unmarked for person and number, in the texts. At the same time, enkan alternates
with en.
   Evidence that it actually is the participle which is found in the conditional is
given in the first example from a letter in which participle and conditional
marker are separated by an adverb:
(IT HI 58.10)
alesin   ikka_peff-il               wel-kon           anni-gil    karte     _pa-eso
truely   you judge-PART             again-3SGCOND     me-to       letter    write-IMPERSG
‘truly if he judges you again, write a letter to me’Often, the protasis is additionally marked by a/esin ‘truly’, as it is the case in the
next example from the Miracle of St. Menas:
(M. 4.16-5.4)
alesin   nod-il        aika        muduu-konno      filoxenith-gille-lo     —_ju-re
truly    god-SUBJ      me          guide-3SGCOND    Philoxenite-to-EMPH     go-1SGPRESIND‘truly, if the Lord guides me, I am going to Philoxenite’                                                                                                   105
The next example also comes from a personal letter. The protasis has the endings
of the conditional including assimilated -/o followed by identical emphasizer -lo
and the apodosis is in the imperative:
(IT III 51.7-8)
tri-mon-kaanno-lo        taanna                _asti-tot-ina      gr-eso
give-reject-3PLCOND-EMPH her-GEN               daughter-young-GEN cause to be-IMPERSG
‘if they reject to give, cause (them) to be her young daughter’s’In the next sentence from the Nicene Canons, we find the endings of the condi-
tional followed by the negative verb men- and again including assimilated -/o. In
this instance, however, we find the subjunctive in the apodosis.
(NC 20.2-3)
iereos-il-lon        wek-ka         —_uis-ka           tir-men-kanno        tan ail-la_—_ pes-en

                                                                                           3SGSUBJNCTPRES ‘and if the priest does not give any compensation, he says in his heart’ Often, forms without -/o are found, resulting in endings which lead over to those
 found in Modern Nobiin and will be presented below. In the sentence from a
 personal letter, the shorter ending of the conditional is followed by the impera-
 tive in the apodosis:
 (IT Ill 51.6-7)
 elok           kotin tanni-ka_tik-kauan-de               pal-a            jour-eeso
 and now        EMPH of her-OBJ give-3PLCOND-and          come forth-AD)   go-IMPERSG
 ‘and now, if they give (them) to her (agent), come forth’ Short forms are also documented in the following examples from the Nicene
 Canons:
  (NC 20.1)
  orpa_ en-kan              elle  en-kan
  wine be-3SGCOND           wheat be-3SGCOND
  ‘if it is wine, if it is wheat’  In Modern Nobiin, a further development of the old conditional is found in one
  of the paradigms presented by Werner (1987:161). The paradigm is evidently
  based on the variant form with -ka-. The plural forms documented by Lepsius
  (1880:11), Reinisch (1879:84) and Abel (1913:14) which represent an earlier
  form of Modern Nobiin are even more similar to their Old Nobiin predecessors.","[104, 105, 106]"
"                                                                                 157
   There is no corresponding form in Old Nobiin as the language had not yet de-
veloped verbal prefixes. Werner (1987:151) rightly rejects any attempt to explain
the element as loan from Arabic. Lepsius (1880:98) derives it from the independ-
ent verb fal- ‘to go out, to come out’, a plausible etymology, as future markers
often grammaticalize from motional verbs.
    It is difficult to trace the origin of the innovated future/intentional in Old No-
biin where the old one is still fully productive. Interestingly, it is in two of the
theological texts that we find clues to the genesis of the new future/intentional.
The two examples support Lepsius’ idea as to the origin of the future prefix fa-
which he developed without any knowledge of Old Nobiin.
(Lec. 100.4-6)

come out-ADJ         be-PART-INCH-PREDFUTURE-EMPH
‘a word [Immanuel] which means “God will be with us”The verb pel- ‘to come out, to go out’ which has the alternative forms pil-/pal- is
the first element in a verbal complex which is marked as future. pel- is followed
by adjunctive -a. The literal meaning of the complex is something like ‘god with
us will come out become being’.
    The next example shows pil- as first verb in a periphrastic construction
marked as participle and followed by a predicative:
(ChN. 11.18-19)
armiskide-Ide        oukkout-ilde-kello         ekka   __ pel-j-il      :       pi-ra
judgment-and         punishment-and-also we-OBJ           come out-PLOBJ-PART   be-PRED*[but in the next (world)}, judgment and punishment will be for us (lit.: ‘coming out for us it is’)’Common to both examples is a verb ‘to be’ following pil-/pel-. No further conclu-
sions can be drawn from only two examples. It seems highly plausible that the verb
pel-/pil-/pal- is the origin of the modern verbal prefix fa(a-). Obviously, the modem
construction is a relatively recent development in Nobiin which was not introduced
into the written language and might even be as late as the 15th or 16th centuries.
       In Modern Nobiin, constructions with fa(a)- as first element combine with the
suffixes of the present to produce the following examples:
(Wemer 1987:151)
tan-gii-n    as-ka                   fa-ed-i
his-uncle-GEN daughter-OB)           IFUT-marry-3SGPRES
‘he will marry his uncle’s daughter’
 158
    Corresponding to Werner’s interpretation as ingressive, the correct translation
    would rather be ‘he is about to marry his uncle’s daughter’.
       To detect any differences between the old and new future/intentional one has
    to look at the contexts provided by the longer texts. There are several examples
    of the gospel:
    (GM 1,8)
    ai uk-ka           gatis-ji-s                      aman       nogo   laakeen
    I you-PL-OB)       baptize-PLOBJ-ISGPRET           water     with    but    tar fa-kir           gatis-ji-n                 fogorti    gudsi-logo
    he IFUT-come         baptize-PL-3SGPRES         ghost      holy-with
    ‘I baptized you with water: but he will come (and) baptize you with the Holy Ghost.’    The sentence presents a typical biblical prophecy in which John the Baptist an-
    nounces the future arrival of Jesus. In Old Nobiin, the old future would have
    been found here, in the Modern Nobiin translation of the Gospel of St. Mark, the
    two constructions can be found side by side in certain contexts but the innovated
    future dominates where there is no direct connection with a verb of saying.
   Evidence for the verbal extension with /a(a)- as a late development in Nobiin
is the less close relationship between the element and the main verb. The next
examples show that different objects can be placed between the two:
(Werner 1987:151)
aboo      fa             shongir-k         __ide-e
my father IFUT           money-OB)         send-3SGPRES
“my father will send money’(GM 1,17)
ai     fa      uk-ka                ademi-rii-n   saiaada-ka-j-jir-eeni
I      IFUT    you-PL-OBJ           man-PL-GEN fisherman-OBJ-PLOBJ-make-for
‘and I will make you fishers of men’The question to be discussed here concerns the function of the fa(a)- prefix be-
tween tense and aspect, future and intentional. Lepsius (1880:97ff.) describes the
form as future but assumes that historically, there was a difference between the
old and the new future in that the old construction with suffixes marked a general
future and the new construction with prefix /a(a)- an intention and will to do
something. To his knowledge, this distinction had disappeared at the time of his
research and constructions with fa(a)- were in the process of completely substi-
tuting the old future. As mentioned above, Werner (1987:151) speaks of ingres-
sive with a second and—if at all—third function as intentional and future. He
interprets fa(a)- as expressing a strong certainty that an action or event is going
                                                                                           159
to take place. Thus, in the sentence aboo fa shongir-k ide-e ‘My father will send
money’, the speaker is quite certain that money will be send. Abel’s informants
(1913:13) give rather similar explanations when they translate fa-ju-r ‘I will go
(certainly, I will definitely go)’. According to Abel, fa(a)- functions as future
tense marker if an exact temporal specification is given, e. g.
Sahr-ee-n-ahara             irkuna      fa-ju-r
month-one-GEN-after         home        IFUT-go-ISGPRES
‘After one month I will go home (I definitely intend to go)’This example, however, is an isolated sentence and has no context. In Abel’s
Ermenne narration, the fa(a)- prefix is predominantly used in conditional claus-
es. But there are also some other contexts, e. g.:
(Erm. 56)
ai     Shatirhassan-ga gelaabiye afri-uwo-ga           fa-jan-ara-teer-[eye]        _hari-raton
I      Shatirhassan-oB) dress    Nnice-two-OB)         IFUT-buy-BEN-[she said}      silk-of
‘I will buy two nice silk dresses for Shatirhassan.’The speaker expresses an intention or wish to buy two dresses; she receives
money from her husband, goes to the market and actually buys the dresses.
   In the next sentence, the woman in the story is speaking to herself about her
intentions to kill her stepson. The chain of action as it is planned by her is ar-
ranged as a regular verbal complex consisting of three verbs two of which have
the adjunctive marker -a (aw-oos-a and uuda-ca-tir-a) and only the last one (fa-
di-keer-) takes the prefix fa- and the tense/person marker.
(Erm. 36)

pan-one-into             Opposite-him     poison-OB)      put-PL-BEN     _IFUT-die-CAUSISGPRES-[she said]
 ‘The woman said to herself: “This night for dinner I will make eggs as food into a pan across from
 him I will put poison for him (and) I will kill him” (she said)’ As we learn only a few sentences later, she doesn’t succeed in killing him which
 gives the complex the connotation of an irrealis. But there are different reasons
 why the sentence is interesting to take a closer look at. We have a temporal ex-
 pression here (en-auwo ‘this night’) within a direct speech statement. The refer-
 ence point is the moment of the woman’s monologue in which she locates an
 action subsequent to the moment of speaking. This might be interpreted as a
 160
 future tense function of fa(a)-. At the same time, a strong intention or volition,
 i.e. to kill the boy, is expressed. Thus, we might speak of a future intentional
 with reference to the innovated future of Old Nobiin.
     It is interesting to look at different occurrences of the innovated future/inten-
 tional in Lepsius’ translation of the gospel. Regularly, it is used with the condi-
 tional, e. g. in
 (GM 11,3)

 10.9 Stativepi- ‘to be, to lie’ is often used independently in Old Nobiin texts, especially in
 geographical descriptions where it expresses that a plot ‘lies’ somewhere. It is
 one of the verbs employed in verbal complexes after adjunctive -a. In these con-
 structions, the verb supposedly functions as a stative (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996: 143,
 Browne 1998c:237—238). Some examples from the texts are:
 (IT15i3-4)
 [...] kit-ka     g[el]gel-tak-a   pal-a          pi-n
 [...] stone-OB) roll-PASS-ADJ     come out-AD)   be/lie-3SGPRESSUB ‘[she saw] that the stone was rolled away (lit.: ‘lies coming out being rolled’)’ This example shows a verbal complex with two adjunctives and the final pi-.
 Here, pi- followed by present tense suffixes of the subjunctive marks a state at a
 time contemporaneous with that of the main verb which in this case is in the pre-
 terit II. The state results from an action—the rolling away of the stone—divided
 into the action itself gelgel- ‘roll’ which is marked as passive by tak-, and the
 next to last verb pal- which functions as a directional. The directional is missing
 in a similar example from the same text. Here, however, the talk is of a headcloth
 and the connotation is not that it is rolled away from a place, but rolled up and
 lying somewhere:
  176
 (IT 1 5 123-24)

 other   place one-in   roll-PASS-ADJ      _be/lie-3SGPRESSUB *[which] was rolled up alone in another place’ The next sentence is part of a longer direct speech (1 Cor 2). In this instance, the
 complex is marked as preterit which might be due to the fact that the hiding
 spoken of happened before the time of speaking.
(IT17 ii 11)
 mystir      _—_igir-tak-a pi-ol-la
 mystery     hide-PASS-AD) be/lie-PARTPRETI-in
 ‘the mystery which was being hidden’The last example again has pi- marked as present, because it is contemporaneous
to the time of the main verb:
(CHN 8, 12-13)
tuskono di-j-ol-gu-na                    gad-gu-kon     —sursur-(ta)k-a    pi-ran
already dic-PL-PARTPRETI-PL-GEN          body-PL-and    disturb-PASS-ADJ _ be/lie-3PLPRESSUB
‘and the bodies of those already dead were disturbed’Regarding the examples analyzed so far, it has to be noted that pi- seems to indi-
cate a state resulting from some past action. All sentences also have in common
that they are additionally marked as passive. This could imply that all the Nobiin
verbs involved were transitive and had to be detransitivized in a stative construc-
tion. As in other languages too, dynamic passive connotations could figure in
some of the examples. Unfortunately, there are not enough examples documented
in the texts to draw any definite conclusion. We have, however, the Modern No-
biin data for comparison.
    In Modern Nobiin, -fii- which is the regular correspondence to Old Nobiin -pi-
is still present as an independent verb ‘to lie, to be’ but also used in a verbal com-
plex. As its predecessor in Old Nobiin, -/ii is always attached to the adjunctive -a.
Lepsius (1880:303) who didn’t recognize the adjunctive function of -a neverthe-
less mentions the complex with -fii in his dictionary and describes it as express-
ing a state. In the gospel of St. Mark, numerous examples for the present as well
as the preterit can be found some of which are also marked as passives. As these
are important for the comparison with Old Nobiin, they will be discussed first:
(GM 10,32)

verbs which are detransitivized by the passive marker -fakk-. The 3"" person plu-
ral ending -fan of the first sentence seems irregular but is actually a compound
suffix consisting of the plural subject marker -j- (see chapter 8.3) and the ending
-san. The plural subject marker seems to be obligatory in the stative although
Werner (1987:185) noted one exception to this rule in his sentences. There are,
however, more examples to be found for stative constructions which do not re-
quire this type of transformation. Some of these are:

 which are interesting to discuss. The verb daa- ‘to be, exist’ is followed by fii- in
 the majority of cases. According to Abel (1913:86), no difference in meaning can
 be deduced whether daa- stands alone or has the stative marker.
 (Erm 22)
 laakini    faalal-la   da-fii-le     semmi-ga      __uudec-c-on        wild-in-doro

 da- and fii-, a container of sort is involved that holds different kinds of material.
 Whether this is the decisive criteria for the combination of the two elements is,
 however, questionable. Contrary to other sentences with da- ‘to be’, a persisting
 State is described whenever /ii- follows.                In each case, an actual stative meaning
seems to be involved. In contrast, constructions with fii- missing often express
situations that have already been terminated at the time of speaking or any other
reference time, as in

irtrealis formations.
    Besides the constructions with da- ‘to be’ discussed above, Abel’s Ermenne
narrative contains examples for stative constructions comparative to those found
in Lepsius’ gospel. The following sentence may serve as an example:
(Erm 72)
ju-a-goni       —_iden-ga        simark-a-fi-ni                    el-on

Although a regular stative interpretation of this sentence is appropriate there is
another connotation present which is even more prominent in the next examples:
(Erm. 40)

 11.3.6 ChangesIf one looks at the chapters above to sum up some general observations on lan-
guage change with regard to syntax one cannot but accept that many construc-
tions or parts of constructions observed in Modern Nobiin cannot easily be ex-
plained from corresponding Old Nobiin forms or actually have no relationship to
the older language stage at all. This seems to be in contrast to the situation de-
scribed for other parts of the grammar for which the beginning of language                                                                                             215
change could often be observed in the texts, especially in the documentary ones
from Qasr Ibrim.
   The most obvious changes took place as a consequence of loss which was
probably triggered by language contact (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996). Diversity in
clause or sentence construction was reduced when the predicative and subjunc-
tive disappeared. Of formerly two ways to construct main and complement
clauses respectively, only one for each clause type was preserved.
    Nobiin subordinating conjunctions were replaced by loanwords from Arabic, a
process which   requires rather competent   speakers of the language. Although
conjunctions were replaced, the corresponding constructions were often main-
tained, as was shown   using the example of the conditional or certain purpose
clauses. The introduction of ken as subordinating conjunction in purpose clauses
is one example for changes which are not easy to explain from Old Nobiin texts.","[215, 216]"

6.2 Preterit/PastIn Old Nobiin, two forms of the so-called preterit or past are found which
Zyhlarz (1928:63) called aorist and preterit and Browne (1989:24ff.) preterit I
and IJ. How both differ in meaning and function from each other has not yet been
sufficiently understood. According to Browne (ibid.), the difference seems to be
aspectual; he regards preterit | as “either a descriptive imperfect or a resultative
perfect”, and preterit II as a “punctiliar past”. He has to notice that this distinc-
tion is already in the process of disappearing. It is completely absent in the sub-
junctive where preterit I is adverbial, preterit [I adnominal. As in the present, the
endings of the subjunctive are the result of the suffixation of personal endings to
a participle. The following assimilation processes can be reconstructed:
Preterit!     —-al/-ol       + -i              Isc          »    *-ali                >          -ari

                             +   -n            2/38G        >    *-s(i)rin            >          esin

paradigms for preterit I and II are (with do/l- ‘love’):
                                       Preterite I                               Preterit II

we have to take a look at some examples from the texts beginning with the more
formal theological ones:
(IT 1, 471)
ak-ona
Sit-3SGPRETIIND‘L... Mary] stayed {at home]’This fragment comes from the gospel of John, chapter 11:30. In this scene when
Martha hears that Jesus is coming, she rushes to meet him, whereas Mary stays                                                                                                           79
at home. The verb has the endings of preterit I. The next sentence ‘And Martha
said to Jesus’ is badly damaged,                      but Browne    reconstructs pes-sna       ‘she said’
which would be preterit II.
(Lect. 111, 6)
in-de       niss-alo      pes-tak-ona
this-and      holy-EMPH   say-PASS-3SGPRETIIND‘and this was named the Holy’This quote is from Hebrews 9:2 and refers to the “Old Covenant” with its imper-
fect offering which is by then obsolete and disappearing. The next example from
the gospel according to John has preterit Il where a dialogue between Martha and
Jesus is quoted in direct speech. Several times, ‘Martha said’ or ‘Jesus said’ is
repeated and introduces direct speech. Contrary to the first two examples, this
one has preterit II:
(IT 1,419)
iesus-ion     —_ pes-sna              tar-gille
Jesus-and        say-3SGPRETIIIND     she-to‘and Jesus said to her’
 If we now tum to the sale documents from Qasr Ibrim we find the formulaic
 introductory words in a release from purchase marked by preterit I:
 (IT 11 31,1)
 papi-lde       on      nad-de      don     seuartu    niss-ildeken tan-loko-lo    par-tak-ona,
 father-and     and    son-and      and     spirit     holy-and     name-in-EMPH   write-PASS-3SGPRETIIND ‘It was written in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.’ In most of the contracts of sale, the date of the transfer is noted. With a following
 date, preterit I is generally used:
 (IT Ill, 36 i 2)
 in         sigen-il            par-tak-ona [Datum]
 this       document-SUBJ    _— write-PASS-3SGPRETIIND
 ‘This certified document was written [in the year 907 from the Martyrs, it being the 5™ of the month
 of Hathya, it being the 24"" of the moon)’
 In the same contract, one of the signatories, a woman named Kapopi, is selling
 land which she inherited from her mother. The process of inheriting was defi-
 nitely completed at the time of the sales contract. The sentence shows preterit II
 indicative:
 80
      (IT III, 36, i 14)
      parre     annu_—   anen-no-joa                   seu-ise                                 miffan-ka
      land = my          my mother-through             inherit-1SGPRETIIIND (SUB expected)     all-OBJ
          ‘[...] as regards all the land that I inherited from my mother’      At the end of the same document, the following sentence seems to mark the final
      closing of the deal and therefore the action. The two verbs also have the suffixes
      of preterit II.
      (IT III, 36 ii 5-6)
      ai maffuda diakon tino-n                  georgiosi-ko         an papi-gu-d-dal        timm-a

      ak-PRESPART         write-ISGPRETII       witness-ISGPRETII-focus
      ‘Il, MafSuda, Deacon, who has the George-Church of the West, sitting in assembly with my Elders,
      wrote and witnessed it’      Some other evident examples of preterit II are found in:
      (IT IIL 54 i 1-2)
      aici    pesa            iwi-ka          sonoji    jan-a      o-se

      ‘I, Pesa, sold the grain to Sonoja’
      (ITT S5 1-2)

      ]         evil      what-OB)   do-ISGPRETIIIND
      “What harm did I do?’      In all three instances, we can assume that the action was over at the time of
      speaking. In a similar way, the closing of deals is certified in the next examples:
      (IT Il 38, App. 1-2)
      ponnen = matarki-ka                 persi-de    tan en-deken-na

      ‘As for the testimony of Nonnen, the witnesses of the fact that Persi and her mother bought (the plot
      of) the Stauros-Church are:”      (IT IIL 44, 3-4)
      tanni-gu-!       janes-sana-lo              jane-ol-gu-l-lon
      her-PL-SUB)          buy-3PLPRETIIIND       buy-PARTPRETI-PL-SUBJ-and      ‘her people bought it, and those who bought it (are):
eee
                                                                                                            81
eee
The two examples are a little bit more complicated because they contain preterit
] as well as preterit II forms. jan-ona eis-sana is a verbal complex with the literal
meaning of ‘they exchanged they took’ = ‘they bought’ (for the discussion of
verbal complexes see chapter 10). The process of buying is broken down into
two separate actions the first the ‘exchange’ being marked as preterit I, the sec-
ond the ‘taking’ as preterit II.                                              ;
   In the second example, the verb of the main clause takes the personal endings
of preterit II, the second is a relative clause where preterit I is generally used
when the subject of the clause is not in the genitive (Browne 1989:25). A similar
construction is found in the next example:
(IT III, 49 ii 1-2)
tann in-in       eis-se-lo                      essi _ dar-ok-kon                 eis-sana-lo
his these       receive-ISGPRETIIIND-EMPH       water be-PARTPRETI-and            receive-3PLPRETIIIND-EMPHajjeji-na      _ille   un      eis-sil-lo                     eis-kon    _nissa      minna-sin
ajjeji-GEN     wheat   your    receive-PARTPRETII-EMPH        rest-and   cleaning     not to be-2SGPRETIISUB
 ‘I received what is his, and they received Ajjeji’s present supply of water. Also, the rest of the wheat
 that you received does not require your cleaning’ In the following example, the Greek aorist of the Vorlage is rendered as preterit I
 and II in two consecutive phrases:
 (CRN. 12, 16-19)
 tan    damar-kon      kam-a-lo             medd-il-gr-ona
 his    bow-and        _hold-ADJ-EMPH__     be ready-PART-CAUS-3SGPRETIIND
 ‘and holding his bow, he caused (it) to be ready;” medd-il-gar-isna                           tar-ia dia-n         tirassi-gu-ka
 be ready-PART-CAUS-3SGPRETIIIND            it-in death-GEN      chains-PL-OBJ
 ‘he prepared in it chains of death’
 Whether the use of two different forms has to be interpreted as a blurring of the
 distinction between preterit I and II or as a deliberate and differentiated percep-
 tion of the two actions cannot be decided on the basis of the available material.
 Examples for the use of preterit I and II in complement or subordinate clauses
 are found in chapter 11 on syntax.
     The blurring of any distinction between preterit I and II which was beginning
  to show in Old Nobiin was completed by the time documentation of the modern
  variant started. By that time, it had led to a merger of the two to one past tense
  paradigm. The element -o- in the 2» and 3"" person singular comes from the old
  preterit I, -s- from old preterit Il. Added to these are the innovated 2d person
  endings. Lepsius (1880:83) calls the form aorist. Abel (1921:4) still lists a para-  82
digm for the subjunctive which corresponds to preterit II subjunctive of Old
Nobiin. The innovated 2""¢ person endings as well as the merger of preterit I and
Il are missing. None of these forms are, however, actually found in Abel’s Er-
menne narrative. The personal endings of the preterit in Modern Nobiin are:
                          Lepsius                Werner
Isc                       -is                    -is

3PL                       -(i)san                sanExamples for the use of the preterit in Modern Nobiin are abundant. Below some
sentences from Abel’s Ermenne narrative:
(Erm. 30)
issig-on:          tellasik-ka                 kab-o-iye?

‘The boys of the neighbour said to her: “He went to his uncles’ house with some of the boys, while
playing” [they said].’Throughout the story, we find numerous instances of the preterit or simple past.
What is narrated in direct speech is in the past as well as the introductory phrase
‘he said’ or similar phrases.
      It can be summarized that the preterit of Modern Nobiin has obviously assumed
most of the functions of the two preterits of the older variant. At the same time,
however, a form emerged which most authors called the perfect. In the negative,
this innovated form completely replaced the old preterit which will be discussed
later. In Old Nobiin, two forms of the preterit are found. The so-called preterit I
seems to have been more rarely used than preterit II. This might be one of the
reasons why only the endings of the 2.4 and 34 person singular were retained when
the paradigms for preterit I and II finally merged into one. The difference between
the two preterits is difficult to determine in the indicative and non-existent in the
                                                                                                       83
subjunctive. Interestingly, in the predicative only preterit | is found. Most of the
time, the distinction between the preterits is blurred which indicates that the proc-
ess of merger and loss had already begun. Some of the functions of the preterits
were later assumed by innovated verbal forms which will be discussed later.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84]"

 2.5.1 The Texts This study is based on Old and Modem Nobiin texts published by various au-
 thors. As the corpus of Old Nobiin is restricted, all texts were included except
 small fragments and texts where only smaller parts were well preserved. Old
 Nobiin textual material extends over a period of seven hundred years. Most of
 the texts cannot be dated accurately; paleographic studies which aim at a chrono-
  logical classification of the material are still missing. There is some evidence that
  most of the documents originate in the tenth to twelfth centuries. The oldest
  manuscript preserved so far dates back to 797 (Lajtar 1997:117); the youngest
  one bears the date 1484 (Adams 1977:533). Half of the documents preserved
  cover religious texts, as e. g. translations of the New and Old Testament, homilies
  and other Christian writings. The other half comprises documentary texts such as
  contracts and letters. In the latter category are 32 manuscripts which were found
  in one vessel at Qasr Ibrim and could be identified as part of 12th century archive
  on the basis of date specifications at the beginning of the texts. Most of the
  documents originate in Lower Nubia where Nobiin is still spoken today. This has
 nothing to do with a geographically uneven distribution of writing in Nubia, but
 with the northern part being much better excavated than the south.
     The two main textual categories differ in several ways. The religious texts are
 often works of translation from Greek Vorlagen and because of the specific con-
 text represent a rather conservative Nobiin. By far the longest religious text is the
 24
so-called Serra East codex which was published by Browne under the name of its
Greek Vorlage Ps. Chrisostom. /n venerabilem crucem sermo (Browne 1984).
The documentary texts, and within this groups one has to mention specifically
the letters, show a more modern language which sometimes even gives the im-
pression of a “spoken” variety. Many concern economic transactions including
sales of land and orders for payment. We find documentation of emancipation of
slaves and the personal correspondence between dignitaries of the Nubian
church.!°
    The entire corpus of Old Nobiin has the size of about one hundred pages of
continuous text.'!' The problems brought about by a corpus which is limited in
content and form are understood but not further discussed here. Nevertheless, it
is more than adequate to serve as the basis for a historical grammar. Hopefully,
more textual material will be found in the future which will allow us to complete
our knowledge of the language. For a survey of the textual editions, I refer to the
list of abbreviations and the bibliography.
    The documents mentioned above were used in their published and annotated
form. 1 mainly worked with the numerous publications by the late Gerald M.
Browne whom we owe most of the first or revised editions of the Old Nobiin
texts. His “Old Nubian dictionary” (1996) and his very compact “Old Nubian
grammar” (2002) have been extremely helpful for me. Griffith’s first editions of
different Old Nobiin texts (1913) and the first comprehensive grammar by Zyh-
larz (1928) were also consulted.
    Because Nobiin definitely ceased to function as written language by the end
of the 15th century we have a large gap in our direct knowledge of the processes
of language change which extends over a period of four hundred years. A few
words and phrases were recorded by the Franciscan Arcangelo Carradori in 1635
in Egypt; the material is interesting but restricted and doesn’t help to reconstruct
language change.
   The modern written documentation of Nobiin starts with the European schol-
ars Leo Reinisch and Richard Lepsius in 1879 and 1880. The latter undertook his
field research   in Nubia    in the   1840s, so that what we call Modern       Nubian    starts
in the middle of the nineteenth century. This classification is arbitrary because it
depends on the presence of linguists in Egypt and the Sudan and not on linguistic
criteria. The longest text published by Lepsius is a translation of the gospel ac-
cording to Mark from Arabic into Nobiin. This he complemented by several
Nobiin songs he recorded when he traveled in the region. In the foreword to his

" As the conditional is discussed in detail in chapter 7, one example has to suffice
 here. We also find the new future/intentional where the English version of the
 bible has constructions with modal verbs, as in
 (GM 9,19)
 isonane-faaminii ai       ud-dan          _fa-aag-roo
 how long             I    you-with        1FUT-stay-] PLINTPRES-how
 isonane-faaminii ai       fa-saabri-rii                       ud-daani
 long                 1    1FUT-hold out-ISGINTPRES           you-with
 “How long shall I be with you? How long shail J put up with you?’This use is not surprising as many languages use this tense/aspect for similar
purposes. Also at the same time, this example consists of questions about the
future. A similar modal use is documented in the next example where fa- func-
tions as additional marker of a jussive:
(GM 1,38)
iig-a-tij-j-on                      irki        mool-kuu-I    fa-juur-oia
Say-ADJ-BEN-PL-3SGPRET              village    near-PL-to     IFUT-go-JUSSIPL
‘he said to them: “Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby’ 299All contexts in which fa- is used have in common that they express possibility,
that they are speculative and irrealis.
    This even more applies when in Modern Nobiin fa(-a) is combined with the
suffixes of the preterit. Lepsius (1880:98ff.) gives a paradigm for what he calls
Juturum exactum but admits that it is not found in his texts. He stresses that even
 in conditionals where he would have expected the construction, the present tense
is regularly used. Abel’s informants interpret the preterit fa-ju-s as ‘I will proba-
bly go (my going depends on the several circumstances)’. This is mentioned in
contrast to the use with the present fa-ju-r ‘I will go (certainly, I will definitely                                                                                                       161
go)’. Werner describes constructions where fa(-a) is used with the preterit as
irrealis, as in
(Werner 1987:151)
ay faa    oos-is
1          IFUT   take out-ISGPRET
‘I was about to take out (but couldn’t)’In Abel’s Ermenne texts, two examples of fa(-a) with the preterit which are not
morphologically marked as conditionals are documented:
(Erm. 32)
    irin     kab-j-an-ahara          faalal-latoni
your         eat-OBJ-INFGEN-after plate-from
    wide jeloow-oos-a         iboo-ga            faalal-la fa-uudi-ti-s
    then wash-DIR-ADJ         your-father-OB)    plate-on IFUT-put-INDOBJ-1SGPRET
    ‘after you eating from the plate I then cleaned it and put (the food) on the plate for your father’    This is a temporal clause with the subordinator -ahara ‘after’ followed by a ver-
    bal complex consisting of two verbs the first of which has adjunctive -a, the
    second is marked for tense/aspect. Abel interprets the sentence as a covert condi-
    tional which is not the whole explanation. In the narrative, several temporal
    clauses with -ahara are present, none is followed by the future intentional, e. g.
    (Erm 17)
    taf-fab-nani   auwok-ka eskalee-ltoni              kis-siin-ahara        iiga-tir-oon
    his-father-GEN night-OBJ water-wheel-from          come-INFPRET-after    said-BEN-3SGPRET     ‘after his father returned from the water-wheel at night, he said to him’     Accordingly, one would expect the simple preterit in sentence 32 above. The
     explanation for the use of the future intentional preterit seems to be that in this
     case it is constructed as an irrealis as opposed to all other occurrences of -ahara
     in the text. It is constructed in such a way because the proposition is wrong, the
     woman speaking is lying, the things she is talking about never happened. Thus,
     we have another example for the use of fa(a)- with the preterit functioning as
     irrealis.
        Abel’s explanation of an underlying conditional might apply for the next sen-
     tence which also presents a future intentional with the preterit.

circumcision-his-OBJ IFUT-make-BEN-ISGPRET    nice (white?)-ADV‘in order to carry out the run, I will carry out one to the south and the north and I will make his
circumcision beautifully’This is a final or purpose clause consisting of a verbal complex with two verbs
the first of which has adjunctive -a, the second is marked for tense/aspect. The
sentence contains a promise to God to be fulfilled after the birth of a son. The
condition this sentence refers to is uttered at the beginning of the paragraph
which the example above closes. The use of the past after fa- reveals that we are
dealing with an irrealis and as a matter of fact the promise the story talks about
could never have been fulfilled because of the speaker’s death.
    What has been called innovated future in the title of this chapter fulfills sev-
eral functions in the tense, aspect and modal system of Nobiin. The few exam-
ples from Old Nobiin which indicate something about the origin of the innova-
tion consist of religious predictions which seem to have the status of intentionals.
In Moder Nobiin, examples for the whole range of tense/aspect/modal marking
can be found. When there is a temporal specification fa- may function as future
tense marker. Without temporal reference, the element regularly marks an inten-
tional. In the translation of the gospel, prophecies              and predictions      are docu-
mented which correspond to those in the Old Nobiin texts. This leads over to the
frequent use of /a- in irrealis constructions which can also be observed with the
conditional. In addition, fa- is used in different kinds of constructions where
modal verbs are necessary in English. Finally, fa- is restricted to the function as
irrealis when used with the preterit.","[161, 162, 163]"
"Although in this sentence -j- could be interpreted as an intensifier, Abel explains
the context as repetitive, i. e. plurality of action is supposed to be indicated. In
his notes, he therefore translates ‘every time the boy does something wrong’. The
use of the phrase nahar-ee-ka ‘one day’, however, contradicts Abel’s translation.
   Plurality of subjects seems to be indicated in the next example:
(Erm. 131)
belel-le   ju-a           masani        oogr-ana-iye                  oogr-ek-kac-e-isan-goni    —_(-c- instead of -j-)

sultani    iiga-tir-oon
sultan     say-BEN-3SGPRET““go into the village, good, call (him)”, and when they fetched and brought him, the sultan said to
him’Abel compares the use of -/- (here as voiceless -c-) in this example with a corre-
sponding passage in Lepsius’ translation of the gospel where we find another
example for marking of the plurality of subject:
(GM 7, 32)
tal-log    mumur       necj    wee-kaa_ekkac-c-isan                            (-c- instead of -j-)
he-to      mute        deaf    one-OB)        take-come-PL-3PLPRET
‘They brought to him a deaf-mute.’It can be summarized that the suffix -/- asserted its position as marker of plural-
ity, either of subject, object or action—the last one additionally having developed                                                                                                                       117
into an intensifier—over the course of the centuries without any indication of
erosion or a tendency towards loss.","[117, 118]"
"       2.3 Linguistic Variation within the Texts       Although Old Nobiin is undoubtedly an earlier variant of Modern Nobiin, it was
       not in the strictest sense a standardized language. A close look at the text reveals
       some variations which shed light on the linguistic background of the scribes.
       These variations are to be expected as the region was linguistically heterogene-
       ous and it would oversimplify the situation to assume that all scribes were moth-
       er tongue speakers of Old Nobiin. In addition to that it goes without saying that
       loanwords from closely related Dongolese/Kenzi also spoken          in Nubia at the
       time of written Old Nobiin were borrowed into the language.
                                                                                               int as ET,

   The sales contract IT III, 36 is one of the texts of special interest in matters of
linguistic variation. It concerns the sale of land owned by a woman named Ka-
popi to another woman named Neuesi. With regard to content, it is fascinating
because it gives information about the position of women in Nubia at the end of
the 12th century (see chapter 13.8). Linguistically, it is interesting because it
contains numerous place names (see chapter 13.10) and most notably words not
found elsewhere. One of these is ana-biti (36 ii 3), presumably a beverage. It is
found as ana-piti in IT 34 1 29, and the second element -piti presumably corre-
sponds to -pitti in ChN. 5.11 and St. 22.5 where it is also found in a compound
denoting a beverage. The phoneme 6 of ana-biti is not part of the original inven-
tory of Nobiin and is also not found as allophonic variant of p. The modern cor-
respondence of Old Nobiin p is f so that it is not evidence of regular sound
change. -biti actually represents the expected Dongolese/Kenzi form because Old
Nobiin p, Nobiin f regularly correspond to Dongolese/Kenzi 5 and vice versa.
Although a scribal error cannot be excluded, the writing variant can also indicate
a different linguistic background. The latter assumption is supported by another
lexeme found in IT III 36, kal- ‘to eat’. The verb ‘to eat’ is one of the few lex-
emes diagnostic for classifying a wordlist as Nobiin or Dongolese/Kenzi by
origin. kal- is the Dongolese/Kenzi word shared by most of the other Nubian
languages whereas Old and Modern Nobiin have the isolated word kap-/kab-.
IT III 36 is the only instance where kal- is documented in writing but in the same
text, also kap- is found.   In the last lines of document   36, we get to know   about
the fee for the scribe who was paid in kind. He was supposed to receive one kol-
in tewiti which corresponds to modern Dongolese/Kenzi kal deewdi ‘flat bread’.
kol- is merely a variant of kal- described above. The alternative use of vowels o
and a is documented again in the same text with kap- and kop- ‘to eat’.
    In the documentary text from Qasr Ibrim, it can be observed that foreign words
or loanwords from Arabic enter into Old Nobiin. In the sales contract IT III 36, the
Arabic word ouati ‘wadi, valley’ is used, only documented in one other instance
in Sale 9 as wati. The use of Arabic wadi is remarkable because regarding the
modern languages, it is restricted to Kenzi. In Nobiin, we find the original farki
or the much more common Arabic loan khor both meaning ‘valley’. Armbruster
(1965:103) lists the latter in the form hoor also for Dongolese.
   Finally, egeti ‘kettle’ is another word which is found only in this text and in
modem   Kenzi, but not in Modern Nobiin.
   A close look at the Old Nobiin dictionary compiled by Browne (1996) on the
basis of the texts reveals that many entries have modern correspondences in
Dongolese and Kenzi, but not in Nobiin. Although numerous of these “missing”
correspondences can be explained by a later loss or/and replacement by Arabic
loanwords in Nobiin, this explanation cannot satisfy for all of the entries. One of
                                                                                    21
the longer texts, Chrysostomus Nubianus (Browne 1984), contains many Old
Nobiin words not documented in any other text. Whether this means that the text
was written in a dialect or style not preserved elsewhere or that it is only a coin-
cidence cannot be resolved. It has to be kept in mind that for the present, we have
a closed corpus of texts and can only work with what is on hand.","[20, 21, 22]"
"
     9.4 Imperfective/Habitual/Continuous     In Modern Nobiin, we find two constructions which have been described as
     habitual by various authors (Reinisch 1879:55; Lepsius 1880:265; Werner
     1987:177). Synchronically, one, aa(g)-, is a prefix, the other, -ken-, a suffix.
     Analyzing the material from Old Nobiin it becomes evident that the two are quite
     different in origin and go back to different time levels. Modern -ken- goes back
     to one of the periphrastic constructions typical of Old Nobiin. A formerly pro-
     ductive construction where an element -ke-/-ki-/-k- was followed by tense/person
     markers developed into a fossilized morpheme -ken- which has to be followed by
     the tense/person markers of the past in Modern Nobiin. aa(g)- on the other hand
      is one of only two independent verbs which developed into a prefixed aspect
      marker—suffixes being the usual form. This development had only just begun at
      he time of written Old Nobiin and will be discussed later (see chapter 10).
         In his Grammar of Old Nobiin (1928:76), Zyhlarz discusses a verbal complex
       hich he calls “Adverbialis II” and interprets as marking a subordinate clause. It
      is, as he continues, only used when the subjects of main and subordinate clauses
      are identical and therefore not expressed in the latter. Zyhlarz gives the element
      -ken as suffix of the “Adverbialis II”. As Browne (1984:85) has shown -ken “is
      actually an expanded infinitive built upon the root k(e)-; [...]”. The element -ke-/
      -ki-/-k- which forms the basis of the construction is one of the syntactic equiva-
      lents of -in- ‘to be’ in periphrastic constructions. It presumably goes back to a
      non-identifiable verbal origin. When participle -/ is suffixed to -ke-/-ki-/-k- and
      followed by nasal -n, regular assimilation rules apply and a geminated nasal
      emerges. The geminated nasal can usually be reduced. -ke-/-ki-/-k- is only used
De
      130
in participle periphrastics. Constructions with -ke-/-ki-/-k- are documented in the
religious texts with the suffixes of present and past, indicative as well as subjunc-
tive, but also with other non-finite constructions and in the imperative:

‘it is because of envy that they shed the blood of the innocent’Browne (1989, 1996) interprets the -ke(n)-complex as denoting consuetudinal or
habitual action. He derives his interpretation from the function it is supposed to
have in modem Kenzi (Hofmann 1983:131ff., von Massenbach 1933:133). In
Kenzi, however, -ken- is only used with the prefix aa- described below as an
innovated marker of the habitual. It has furthermore been proven that the aa-/
-ken construction is a loan from Nobiin into Kenzi (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996). Nev-
ertheless, the examples above which represent many more with similar contents
and contexts show some important similarities. They all refer to actions and
situations which are or were consistently or regularly or continuously performed,
happening or emerging. Thus, the -ke-/-ki-/-k complex fulfils the criteria of a
general imperfective, with a more special function of a habitual or even iterative.","[130, 131]"

Lepsius (1880:164) translates the sentence as complement clause.
     As can be seen, the meaning and morphology of the original ‘to say’ verb i- is
 lost in the process of grammaticalization as a complementizer. Therefore the
different authors have to conclude the arbitrariness of the variant forms. Con-
structions which originally consisted of two independent clauses were reanalyzed
as a matrix verb and a complement clause introduced by a complementizer. In a
next stage ‘say’ is used with other clause types as the following example shows:

The examples above present purpose clauses which not only consist of the com-
plementizer,       but also show a                   future infinitive. This construction                 was     already
identified by Lepsius (1880:144ff.).
   Saxena (1995) describes a grammaticalization process where a word meaning
‘say’ expands its grammatical function from direct quote marker/complemen-
tizer to reason/purpose marker to conditional marker to comparative marker.""
The first two stages are present in Modern Nobiin as the examples above demon-
strate.
     The Ermenne narrative documents another use of the verb-turned complemen-
tizer. In almost forty instances the endings follow the predicative of mas- ‘good’,
as in
(Erm. 28)
mas-aiye        iig-o-tir-a                taf-faab-in-den-ga

iig- ‘to say’. In the next sentences jig- is missing in the Nobiin text, although it is
translated by Abel:

10.6 The New Habitual/ImperfectiveIt will be shown that the verb -ak-/-a(a)g- with the original meaning of ‘sit, re-
main, stay’ had entered into a process of grammaticalization in Old Nobiin as
second verb of a verbal complex which resulted in a durative in the modern lan-
guage. Not many examples for the beginning of this development, however,
could be found in Old Nobiin. The same holds true for -ak-/-a(a)g- as first verb
in a complex.
   As the -ke-/-ki-/-k- periphrastics were generalized from the special function of
marking the habitual to a general imperfective, the need may have arisen to find
new ways of expressing habitual action. As we know from Modem Nobiin, this
has actually happened. The a(ag)- complex seems to have filled the gap left by                                                                                              163
the original habitual. a(ag)- is one of only two verbs which were grammatical-
ized as first elements in a complex.                                      ;
   In almost all of the classical religious texts, ak- is only documented in the
function of a simple verb. In Lectionary 111,3, however, we find the following
sentence:
(Lec. 111,3)
palyei] [r iin Jil-appa ak-dak-tak-ara[sin]
shrine-SUBJ-for         sit-be covered-PASS-PERFPREDPART-(for)‘For the [first] tabernacle was set up.’Here, ak- ‘sit’ is used in a verbal complex preceding another verb tak- “be cov-
ered’. The complex is ambivalent and can be understood in two ways. Browne
(1996:8) lists ak-dak- as a compound with the new meaning of ‘set up’ (‘sit,
remain’ + ‘be covered’). This new meaning is mainly derived from the Greek
 Vorlage of the Nubian text which is Hebr. 9.2, where the setting up of the taber-
nacle is described. The second possible interpretation derives from just this con-
tent. The text talks about the traditional way of sacrifice of the old religion. Ha-
bitually, the tabernacle or tent was set up in which the lampstand, the table and
the loaves were of display. From the whole context, a translation of dak- as
 ‘cover up’ is plausible. Then, ak- could be ascribed the function of marking a
 habitual action.
    A second and undisputable example is documented in a part of a psalm docu-
 mented in the Qasr Ibrim texts:
 (ITH, 13 ii, 20-23)
 ak-oup-ar-ra-sin            kiptou-gu-ka_     ou-gille on’
 Sit-fall-CAUS-PRED-EMPH people-PL-OBJ we-(in)to and
 sippi-gu-k       on oun’    oei-n         tri-ltauo
 nation-PL-OBJ    andour     foot-GEN      pair-under ‘He has overturned peoples for us and nations also under our feet.’ In this example, ak- preceding the causative ‘cause to fall’ can be interpreted as
 marking a habitual action. The quotation talks about God and what God ‘habitu-
 ally’ does for his chosen people.
     These few examples do not allow drawing any substantial conclusions con-
 cerning the grammaticalization of ag- in Old Nobiin. It can be said that it goes
 back to a verbal complex with ag- as the first element. The literal meaning of the
 example from Qasr Ibrim would be ‘he causes to overturn sitting’ or ‘he causes
 to overturn and sits’, ‘sitting’, however, being desemanticized and developing in-
 to a function word.","[163, 164]"
"
 Posteriority Temporal clauses of this type often show the postposition -pau(u) ‘when, until’
 as subordinating conjunction or complementizer. In these contexts, -pau(u) ex-
 presses the end of a period of time, as in
 (IT 11 58, 11)
 ai-de urti-ka           den-e[n]                 pau         ak-ire
 I-and   property-OB)    give me-3SGPRESSUB_          until   stay-1SGPRES ‘I am staying until he gives me the property’
202
 The subjunctive seems to be regularly used, if the subject of the main clause
 differs from that of the subordinate clause. If the two are identical, the participle
 can be employed.
      Although the subjunctive is expected in the subordinate clause the indicative
 is found in the next sentence. There are several other examples for the use of the
 indicative in complement/subordinate clauses in the documentary texts which
 could indicate the beginning of the loss of subjunctive forms.
 (IT IIL 55 ii 3-4)

 food, until he came to Philoxenite’As the subject of the main clause is the same as that of the subordinate clause,
the participle is used with -pauka. The use of the object marker suggests that
-pau is a noun by origin. There is only one possible candidate in the Old Nobiin
dictionary pau(u) ‘power, authority, order’. The object marker -ka is often used
in temporal expressions to denote duration (see chapter 3.2.3).
     A remnant        of this construction          seems       to be preserved         in what   Werner
(1987:191 ff.) calls the subjunctive with -/aan ‘until’. Although initial -- in Mod-
em Nobiin regularly corresponds to Old Nobiin -p-, final -n is not easy to ex-
plain. The forms are discussed in Excurse 1.
    Abel (1913) as well as Lepsius (1880) have the temporal postposition -famini
‘until’ in the position of -faan. Zyhlarz (1928:95) cites an unfortunately damaged
Old Nobiin graffito where he reads pami ‘until’ which could be related to
-famini. As subordinating conjunction, -famini follows the infinitive, as the ex-
amples from the Ermenne narrative and the gospel according to Mark show:
(Erm. 39)
wilit-ta_    inp-adaag-roi         geraia-Itoni   kir-o-famin

                                                                                                     203
(GM 6.10)

where    place-at   your    go-INFPRES     house-into   thereat   stay-IMPERPL   your   go-INFPRES-until“wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave’The two examples show that the infinitive is employed whether or not the sub-
jects of the clauses are identical. If the subject is expressed as in the second in-
stance, it is in the genitive in accordance with the nominal character of the verb
 in the subordinate clause.
    Only Reinisch (1879:39ff.) gives -faan as well as -famini as Nobiin forms in
 his dictionary. This could indicate a dialectal variation within the language.
 There and in his grammar (1879:148), he cites an additional variant -duofamini/
 -duefamini also mentioned by Lepsius (1880:289) who adds variant -duuwe-
Jfaminii). An example from Lepsius’ gospel is
(GM 9.9)
tariin fas-siin-keela              duuwefaaminii    diio-kuu-ltooni
his    _rise-PARTPRETII-after      until            dead-PL-from
‘until after he rose from the dead’The literal meaning is ‘until after his having risen from the dead’. Lepsius inter-
prets the first part as the independent verb duu- ‘come, reach, arrive, happen’
which is most probably related to Old Nobiin dul- ‘be (located), exist, remain,
continue’ used in periphrastic constructions after the participle or predicative. A
construction like the one above is reminiscent of the periphrastics of Old Nobiin
and could be regarded as evidence for their partial preservation in some fossilized
contexts.","[202, 203, 204]"
" Browne (ibid.) hypothesizes that -a is a reduced form of ia- ‘saying’ which con-
 sists of the verb -i plus adjunctive -a.
    -a does not only function as marker of direct speech, but also as complemen-
 tizer in Old Nobiin. That Browne’s hypothesis on the origin of -a is correct, is
shown below, where the non-reduced and the reduced forms are found as com-
plementizers in similar contexts. In these examples they are used with the verb
ank- ‘to think’:

was described as second stage of the grammaticalization process above. The next
examples show the marker of direct speech/complementizer as marker of reason/
purpose clauses:
(Lec. 109.1)
Osi-j-e-a-ion                                seni-min-ne-so

This sentence from the Lectionary is interesting in that -a and conjunction -ion
follow the imperative, resulting in a complex suffix -eaion. The connection with
the imperative as well as with the verb ik- (ek-) ‘to say’ is found in the following
examples from the documentary Qasr Ibrim text:
(IT II] 48.7-8)
ai-roko-lo            magak-ka_       _oss-e-a                     ek-eso
I-through-EMPH        magal-OB)       take oult-IMPER-COMP         tell-IMPER
‘tell in order that it be taken out to Magal through me’ (lit.: tell: ‘take out to Magal through me’)Without a following conjunction the suffix imperative singular -e and marker of
direct speech/complementizer -a result in the compound suffix -ea.
   Other examples of purpose clauses are:
(Lec. 112.10)

 clauses are expressed by the infinitive and the verb i- + adjunctive -a. The result-
 ing compound suffix -ia is often reduced to -a which functions as marker of
 direct speech.
     Wanting to summarize what has been discussed above we have to turn to the
 different forms as well as to the various functions and the possible relationship of
 the two.
    In Old Nobiin, a verb il- ‘to say’ is found which is often reduced to i-. It has
 various forms and functions depending on the contexts and the following end-
 ings. The forms and function can be listed as follows:
 96
 Form                                         Function
 i(l)-                                        reinforces another verb of speaking
 i- + -a adjunctive reduced to -a-            marker of direct speech
 i- + -a adjunctive or reduced -a             complementizer
 imperative + -ia or reduced -a               purpose clauseThe combination of the various additional endings needed to express the differ-
ent functions produces a wide range of compound suffixes, as e. g.
reduced -a                                            -a
i- + -a adjunctive                                    -ia
-ia + -ion conjunction ‘and’                          -iaion
imperative -e + reduced -a                            “a
imperative -e + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a           -esoa, -esa
imperative -e + reduced -a + -ion conjunction         -eaion
imperative -ana + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a         -anasoSome of these endings are obviously related to those listed by Lepsius (1880) for
Modern Nobiin under the different headings “imperative”, “conjunctions” and
“purpose clause”. On the way from Old to Modern Nobiin the imperative/jussive
dropped optional emphatic -so. Imperative markers -e and -ana are still present
from Old Nobiin. To these Lepsius (1880:139ff.) adds other endings which are
now well known from Old Nobiin. If we isolate these endings, we find:
SG        -ee the long vowel presumably going back to imperative -e + -a
          -ia(a)
PL        “a
          -ia(a)According to Lepsius (1880:139ff.) for the 3"" person jussive occasionally -ion
for the singular and plural is added to the 24 person endings, resulting in suffixes
38G       -eion
3PL       -anaionWhat we find here are not new endings for the imperative but the markers of
direct speech/complementizer of Old Nobiin. Either Lepsius misinterpreted these
endings due to the fact that all his examples for imperatives necessarily consisted
of either direct speech or complement clauses/indirect speech or we are dealing
with a reanalysis of Old Nobiin purpose clause as simple imperatives.
   Lepsius and Abel note that in the texts the different forms of the ending inter-
change arbitrarily. These variations consist of:
Form
Lepsius      -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion
Abel         -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye
Wemer     = -aya/-yon/-ayon/-eyon                                                                                    97
The endings given by Lepsius and Werner are similar, because they both include
at least some forms which add -ion/-yon. Werner (1987:342) lists -aya as non-
personal form meaning ‘saying’. The three other suffixes are translated as ‘he
said’, thus being interpreted by him as 3'4 person singular preterit which, how-
ever, has lost final -n according to his own paradigm. From the many examples
in the texts it seems much more probable that these endings go back to Old No-
biin forms with conjunction -ion ‘and’ (see above).
      All in all a table with the different forms and function of the verb-turned com-
plementizer in Modern Nobiin shows many similarities in function, but no longer
clear-cut divisions between the forms:
Form                                                 Function
-ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion                                 reinforces another verb of speaking
-eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye           }                  marker of direct speech

 future infinitive + -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion            purpose clause
                     -ecye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye   }
mas- ‘good’ + -ceye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye                discourse markerIt seems that in the process of becoming Modern Nobiin several morphosyntactic
and functional processes took place. Compounding and cliticization occurred in
Old Nobiin when the reduced verb i- and adjunctive -a were combined to func-
tion as marker of direct speech and complementizer. The verb i- ‘to say’ was
desemanticized to become a complementizer. In Old Nobiin, different assimila-
tion processes were involved depending on the preceding words or phrases. The
resulting phonologically determined variations were obviously reanalyzed as free
alternatives, morpheme boundaries disappeared. The optional connection of the
endings with conjunction -ion ‘and’ was also included in the various processes
and a merger took place with the preceding verb-tumned complementizer. It also
was completely desemanticized. Although the use of the different ending is arbi-
trary today, Old and Modern Nobiin are still rather similar with regard to the
form and function of the elements described above. The most striking difference
concerns the use with purpose clauses. The various endings are still used to ex-
 press purpose, but have to follow the Old Future.","[95, 96, 97, 98]"
"13.1 Some Thoughts about SourcesWorking on Nubian history we are in the fortunate situation to be able to base
our studies on different written sources. As mentioned above Christian and Mus-
lim authors took an interest in the religious and political processes in Nubia and
of capital importance are the documents written by the Nubians themselves in
various languages used in the medieval millennium.
      This promising basis had less positive impact on historical studies than could
have been expected.          Most scholarly works         on medieval      Nubian    history   lack
serious source criticism, which is supposed to be standard procedure for any
historical study, let alone any kind of historical discourse analysis which is based
on post-modern theories introduced by French philosopher Michel Foucault in
the 1970s, now an important paradigm in cultural studies including history.'®
This cannot be required of older works, but even modern studies often take the
bait of accepting medieval writing at face value, not asking for any religious or
political context in which they were compiled.”
      In this chapter, following discourse theoretical approaches, it is argued that all
the texts, whether they are of Muslim, Christian or Nubian origin, have in com-
mon that they do not reflect a historical reality but produce this reality in writing.
Thus, they cannot be regarded without consideration of the dominant discourses
of the respective eras, societies, religions, regions etc. they constituted parts of.
   As mentioned above we have to distinguish at least three different types of
sources concerning Nubia in the medieval millennium. Setting aside early, i.e.
pre-sixth century writings from Nubia and neighboring regions which are of no
interest here, written records concerning the period under consideration start with
the narratives about the alleged conversion of Nubia to Christianity. As these will
be discussed in detail below, only some explanatory notes on the discursive '9   For Foucault’s epoch making studies see Foucault 1972 and others.
20    See for example Adams 1977, 1996; Welsby 2002. There are, of course, positive examples to be
      mentioned, such as the works of Spaulding (and Kapteijns, see bibliography), Hunwick, and oth-
      ers.",[220]
"3.3 PostpositionsOld Nobiin had a     rich inventory of postpositions only some of which are still
present or productive today. Postpositions followed the subjective or the genitive
depending on their origin and meaning. There are simple postpositions and com-
pound ones. Below, some of the postpositions of Old Nobiin are presented and
discussed with regard to their origin and change in their process of becoming
Modern Nobiin. For a full inventory of old and modern postpositions see the
respective grammars and dictionaries.
   Old Nobiin had a set of simple postpositions which usually followed a noun in
the subjective case. Sometimes an -(/)-element of indefinable origin and function
preceded these postpositions (Hintze 1975a:68; Browne 2002:67). Examples are:
Old Nobiin
-la (-Ila)     *(in)to, in, from’Because of the wide range of meanings of this postposition it is one of the most
common ones documented in the texts. It functioned as local, directional and
temporal postposition, as the examples below illustrate:

 semantic range:

time       its-at‘at that time’For the use of -/a as a marker of temporal clauses see below chapter 11 on syntax.
    A comparably wide range of meanings is found with the postposition -/o (-/lo)
‘in(to), in, from’ in Old Nobiin. -/o and -/a are quite similar in meaning and func-
tion so that a common origin is possible. Only -/o, however, functions as an
emphasizer in many contexts (see under Excurse 3). At times, the two postposi-
tions are used in identical contexts and seem to be interchangeable. It has to be
taken into consideration that the vowels a and o are often confused in Old Nobiin
and represent either dialectal variation or simply lack of precision on the part of
the scribes, as Browne (2002:15) proposed.
    In Modern Nobiin, we find -/o/-ro ‘in, from, out of? as equivalent. According
to Werner (1987:131), this postposition is almost extinct and only found as sec-
ond element in a complex noun + postposition. As postpositions usually follow
nouns his statement might imply that he only found lexicalized use. He gives the
example:
in-iin       ahar-ro                      ‘afterwards, thereafter, lastly’
this-GEN     end-inInterestingly, in the gospel according to Mark (e. g. 1.32) we find ahar-ra with
the postposition -/a suffixed to the noun instead. Lepsius and Abel do not list
-lo/-ro amongst the postpositions. What we do find in the Ermenne text is a com-
pound postposition -/o-tooni ‘from’ which will be discussed below. It can be
concluded that of the two postpositions -/a and -/o which overlapped in meaning
and function and were already interchangeable in Old Nobiin finally only -/a
survived as a productive element and that -/o was only preserved in a few lexi-
calized contexts. Both simple postpositions were used to construct more complex
ones (see below). In these cases, the overlapping of meaning and interchange-
ability of the two is also found.

-(I)do                                    ‘upon, at, to, for, over, from, in, against’This is another Old Nobiin postposition with a wide range of meanings.                   Some
examples are:                                                                                           39

the first part -id- (or assimilated -ir- or -in-) is difficult to determine. Abel simply
 ignores it and Lepsius wrongly interprets it as a genitive construction -in-do. -do
 is also found as second element of the interrogative pronoun -siddo ‘where’ and
 in adverbs indo ‘here (= this in)’ and mando ‘there (= ‘that in)’.
    The simple postpositions described above were attached to nouns to construct
 more complex ones. Examples are:

This compound                   postposition       represents a very          common     type of construction
consisting of a noun plus a simple postposition. In Old Nobiin, these two ele-
ments had already merged and were completely lexicalized. An independent
noun au ‘interior’ no longer existed. The non-contracted form appears in a sales
contract as well as in the formal Lectionary (101,5), so that both forms obviously
existed side by side for quite some time. Both of the two simple postpostions -/a
and -/o appear in the second postion behind the noun without any change in
meaning. In the Lectionary, we also find one instance where aua functions as an
adverb, but is actually attached to a genitive:
(Lect. 111.13-14)

manna-GEN             within      be-3SGPRES(?)“manna being(?) within’Interestingly, the form of the postposition ending with -o is restricted to one of
the texts discovered in Old Dongola. This, however, leads over to Modern No-
biin and the regular form

After or parallel to the merger and lexicalization of au ‘interior’ + -/a/-lo ‘in’ into
-(l)-au()a/-(1)-auo ‘within, into’ a second compound emerged which consisted of
the body part noun tu- with the literal meaning of ‘belly’ and a more metaphori-
cal one of ‘interior’, and the simple postposition -/a ‘in’. The noun was inde-
pendently used in Old Nobiin and is in fact still in use in the Modern variant.
Only very few examples of this compound postposition are found in the texts.
Contrary to -(1)-au(1)a/-(l)-auo, -tu-la followed the genitive so that we have a
regular possessor/possessed-construction:

‘(what) they ate and drank within the writing-office (?)’On the way to Modern Nobiin, a merger or fusion of -fu- and -/a occurred. In
Werner’s grammar (1987:138) a form, -twul, is given where the phonological
substance of the postposition—as happens so often in grammaticalization proc-
esses—is reduced by erosion. The final -a is lost and the simple postposition -/a
has disappeared as a phonological unit. But Werner also lists the unreduced form
-tuula which is found in the Ermenne text. Lepsius (1880:401) lists the two vari-
 ants side by side. The postposition still follows the genitive. The noun -tu ‘belly,
 inside’ is also used independently in Modern Nobiin. Examples are:
 (Erm. 36)

      -tauo                                         ‘below, under’      looks like it was constructed in a similar way as -auo ‘within, into’ above. A
      noun with the meaning of ‘underside’ is not documented in Old Nobiin and was
      possibly already lost. -tauo is often found in toponyms (see chapter 13.10). In
      Modern Nobiin, -sawwo ‘lower side, underside, under, below’ can function as a
      postposition when attached to a genitive and as an independent noun. An exam-
      ple for its modern usage is
      (GM 7,28)

      he __ below-his-at          Sit-3SGPRET      ‘he sat below him’ lit.: ‘he sat at his underside/below’      Contrary to Werner (1987:36ff.), it is assumed here that the use of awwo and
      tawwo as nouns             is the result of a re-interpretation of a former postpositional
      phrase.
          A different origin and development can be assumed for modern -dooro ‘upper
      side, above, against, because of’ and -gasko ‘center, mid, amidst’ both function-
      ing as postpositions following genitives. Although -dooro is also found in place
      names, its origin is difficult to determine. In one Old Nobiin passage we find:
      (IT I, 4 ii 26)
      lesusi     map-an_   tri-ka           dolle       _polg-ara           [pessna]

      more plausible derivation would be an origin in the verb dodul- ‘be high’
      (Browne 1996:49) which consists of -do ‘upon’ (see above) as adverb and the
      verb -dul ‘be, be located’. As there are other instances of a change from Old
EEE
                                                                                                                  43
Nobiin -d- to Modern Nobiin -r- this is highly probable. The verb doduI- is e. g.
documented in
(IT 11.13 ii. 17)
nodu      dodul                         ‘the high Lord’
god       be(ing) high(ITH 12 ii 7)
dodul-o       du-n                      ‘who is on high’
be high-on be-3SGPRET
Modern -dooro might well be a contracted form of -dodulo. An example for its
use in Modern Nobiin is
(GM 6,48)
aman-dooro          tapp-a-juu-on
water-above         walk-ADJ-g0-3SGPRET
‘he walking on the water”Modern -gasko ‘center, mid, amidst’ also appears to be a compound with former
-lo suffixed to a noun. In Old Nobiin, however, we find the compound gasknau-
la ‘in the midst’ which follows the genitive as does its modern equivalent.
Gasknau-la itself is a genitive construction consisting of a noun gask- with un-
known meaning, genitival -n and the compound postposition -au-/a ‘within, into’
 described above. If we assume gask- denoted something like ‘centre’ or ‘mid’,
 the literal meaning of the compound would have been ‘in the interior of the cen-
 ter’. Through several processes of fusion, assimilation and loss the modern form
 -gasko emerged.
    Some other postpositions are worthy of discussion here. A few of them are
 only documented in a few or even isolated instances. To the latter belongs
 Old Nobiin
 -mol                                    “close to, nearness’ which       follows the genitive and therefore represents an original possessive
 phrase. The only example seems to be
 (IT I1 23. 7-8)
 sulwi      kroda-m-mol         do-en                     ‘if you come near/close to the Sulwi Kroda’
 Sulwi      Kroda-GEN-near      come-PARTCOND In Modem Nobiin, we find a noun -mo(o)/ ‘nearness, proximity, neighbour’
 which, however, takes the simple postposition -/a to function as the compound
 postposition -mo/(o)i(I)a ‘close to, nearby’ which follows the genitive (the suffix
 of which may be deleted).

        what happened. It seems that in Old Nobiin -mol was a noun which expressed a
        locational relationship in a possessive construction. Like every other noun too,
        -mol could take various postpositions, examples of which are found in Modern
        Nobiin, e. g. in the gospel according to Mark:
        (GM 4,1)
        aadem_    kaamil    barri-laa   aman     mool-laa          aag-ji-san

        ‘and he intended to pass by them (lit.: by their neamess)’        Contrary to -tul above, the construction -mo/ + postposition is fully productive
        and neither fusion nor reduction have yet taken place.
           Werner lists another compound postposition, -faala ‘outside of’ following the
        genitive and derives it from a hypothetical noun *faa ‘outside’ and the postposi-
        tion -/a. He also cites a noun faado ‘outside’ with the same presumed nominal
        basis. The Ermenne narrative has one example of an adverbial use of faado in the
        phrase faado fal- ‘go outside’ (1913:37).                  Lepsius’ gospel only has faado too.
        -faala is not mentioned by the two authors. There is one instance of a similar
————E
        adverb in the Ibrim texts:
        (IT 111 49 ii 3)
        Sario         ak-il-gu-ka               0-ar-j-es-eso

        postposition -/o. The nouns doesn’t seem to be documented in Old Nobiin unless
        it is related to fa(ajl- ‘door, gate’, an equation which might be a little farfetched.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"
"
11.1 Nominal SentenceAs has been presented in chapters 5.1 and 5.2, a nominal sentence of Old Nobiin
has a noun or its equivalent marked as predicate by the predicative suffix -a.
Often, emphatic particles (-sin, -lo, -m(a), -mi) are added to the predicate. In
Modern Nobiin, men- ‘to be’ has to follow. As in the 3 person singular, the verb
can be dropped, the resulting construction resembles those in Old Nobiin. The
emphatic particles have disappeared. Examples are given in chapter 5.2 and need
not be complemented here.",[183]
"The particle -is-, often reduced to -s-, may also take verbal suffixes, as in:
 is-sana (i. ¢. is-rana 3PLPREIND)              ‘whatever/whoever they are’
 s-ena (i.e. is-ena 3SGPRESIND)                 ‘is it...2?, what is...?’
s-il       (i, €. is-il PARTPRES)               ‘who is...?’ The last example is only documented in one of the personal letters of Qasr Ibrim
 (although there might be one arguable instance in the Stauros text; Zyhlarz
 1928:43) and seems to be evidence for the development to Modern Nobiin. In
 the more informal context of letters, we also find combinations of min-/men- and
 -is- which probably are evidence of a more colloquial variant of Old Nobiin:
 (IT 1123.1)
 made         56   min-is-ena
 millet            what-INTERROG-3SGPRESIND
 ‘what about the 56 (artabs of) millet?’ (IT II] 48.2)
 men-s-ena
 what-INTERROG-3SGPRESIND  ‘what is it?’  In Modern Nobiin, these complex forms are not present. The interrogative parti-
  cle -is-, however, is preserved in a form which has to be analyzed. The following
  formations can be found in the various texts and dictionaries:
  siddo                 (do ‘place’)                             ‘where?’
  sikkir                (kir ‘manner’)                           ‘how?’
  sille                 (INTERROGPART -lc ?)                     ‘who?’
  siddoton              (do ‘place’, -ton ‘from’)                ‘where from?’
  sikkeel               (keel ‘end, boundary, limit”)            ‘how long?, how big?’
  sillog                 (-log ‘with, by, through’)              ‘from where?’
 sin(n)                  (GEN marker -n)                         ‘whose?’
  60
It is evident from the geminated middle consonants of the interrogatives that it
can not be the simple particle -(j)s- which is preserved in Modern Nobiin. In-
stead, it seems to be Old Nobiin s-i/ ‘who is...?’, the interrogative particle
marked as present participle, which provided the basis for the modern forms. The
geminated consonants are the result of regular assimilation processes.

sil-n       -       sinnIn summary, it can be noted that in the system of pronouns no basic changes have
occurred. The loss of inclusive/exclusive distinction with the personal pronouns
is the most noticeable one. Reduction of plural marking at the demonstratives
corresponds to the general changes in nominal plural marking which took place
in the course of the development from Old to Modern Nobiin. Concerning the
interrogatives, some changes which finally led to the modern pronouns were
already observable in the Old Nobiin texts. To these belong the use of -m/(i)i
‘why’ and the development of s-i/ ‘who is...?’ combined with different postposi-
tional elements.","[60, 61]"

3. The Noun
3.1 NumberOld Nobiin has a common nominal plural marker -gu. Much less common are
the two markers -ri-gu and -ni-gu. Zyhlarz’ (1928:36) attempt to divide these two
along the categories animated (-ri-gu) vs. inanimate (-ni-gu) has to be rejected.
Browne (2002:31) associated -ri-gu with loan words from Greek, but only as an
optional variant, and his first example mug-ri-gu ‘dogs’ can not be regarded as a
Greek loan at all. As -ri- as well as -ni- precede the basic plural marker -gu we
can assume that an original distinction which complemented -gu lost its function
and meaning. In all cases, -gu may be deleted. The plural markers precede the
case markers (see below).
    In Modern Nobiin, nominal plural marking is more complex due to loans from
the related Nubian languages Dongolese/Kenzi (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996). The
language has four plural markers two of which are absent in Old Nobiin texts.
The Old Nobiin basic plural morphemes -gu as well as the less common -ri (with
-gu always absent) are preserved, -ni-gu is lost. According to Werner (1987:80),
-gu and -ri are marked by high tone. Two low tone suffixes -ii and -ncii are mod-
ern loans. In Dongolese, -i is suffixed to a noun with a terminal consonant, -nci
to a terminal vowel (Armbruster 1960:159). In Nobiin, the use of the borrowed
plural suffixes is not restricted to loanwords from Dongolese. Which of the four
plural markers of Modern Nobiin is used with a certain noun is not predictable
and seems to be optional. Lepsius (1880:32) tried to find some regularity and
related -nci to nouns with a final long vowel and accent on the last syllable if
disyllabic. According to Werner (1987:81), words ending in high tone -ée take
plural -ncii in most cases.
    If we take the example of -gi(i) ‘uncle, mother’s brother’, it takes plural suffix
-ncii according to Lepsius (1880:32). In Abel’s Ermenne text which has numer-
ous examples for ‘uncle’, gi- has plural marker -gw suffixed in all instances.
Khalil in his Nobiin dictionary (1996:26) gives both suffixes as optional alterna-
tives. All things considered it can be concluded that Nobiin and Dongolese Nu-
bian language contact added to the Nobiin system of plural marking and made it
unpredictable with regards to which suffix has to be used with a certain noun.","[30, 31]"

       This was discovered by Griffith when he worked on Meroitic and Old Nubian. Lately, it has
       repeatedly been discussed whether a Meroitic origin of Old Nubian characters is plausible, not
       least because the Nubian characters seem to represent phonemes different from Meroitic. This ar-
       gument, however, is not convincing as the characters might represent the spoken Meroitic of the
       time Old Nubian was put into writing.

      Although Greek was introduced to Nubia during the 26th dynasty and later by
    the Ptolemies, its use intensified after the Roman conquest of Egypt, when
    northern Nubia became an extension of Roman Egypt—at least from the Roman
    point of view. The Romans replaced Egyptian with Greek as the official language
    of administration and law.‘ There were also Nubians who took the opportunity to
    climb the social ladder to become part of the Roman establishment. A Nubian
    named Paccius Maximus obviously received a Greek education and composed
    Greek poetry which was inscribed on the walls of local temples. There are some
    findings which suggest that Greek was taught at Meroe itself (Burstein 2006).
      The development of Greek as a lingua franca is closely related to the introduc-
    tion of Christianity which started in the Sth century AD. At the same time, Greek
    became one of the written languages of “international” or diplomatic communi-
    cation between peoples of different linguistic background. A letter written by a
king of the Blemmyes (Beja) to a Nubian king dated to the 5th century is evi-
dence of this development (Skeat 1977; Plumley 1982). Relating to the language
of this letter, Hagg (1982:105) speaks of “Pidgin Greek, in the strict sense of the
term, that is, a means of communication between two parties, neither of whom
used Greek as his native tongue, and with the grammatical structure partly bro-
ken down”. Numerous inscriptions and graffiti show a Nubian-Greek bilingual-
    ism which exhibits some sort of “mixture” of the two languages. Jakobielski
(1972:14) speaks of “mixed texts [...] which—with fundamentally Old Nubian
structure—preserve some Greek words together with articles or Greek texts with
numerous orthographical and grammatical errors”.
   This, however, is not the whole story. Greek in Nubia was by no means a pid-
gin language, although we have to speak of a genuine Nubian variant. The Chris-
tian Middle Ages were the heyday of Nubian Greek and the language was one of
the official languages of government and religion. Political terminology was
borrowed from Greek and books were written in the language. Greek inscriptions
and graffiti as well as the remains of a library were found at Qasr Ibrim and it
has to be assumed that this was not the only place in Medieval Nubia where an
abundance of written material was archived. Scratched on the walls of churches
innumerable graffiti were preserved, as many as 650 in one church. Many of
these short texts were written in the first person. Hundreds of funerary stelae
with Greek inscriptions have been found all over Nubia.® As Burstein (2006) has
pointed out, variations between the texts on the stelae attest to the linguistic
competence of the Nubians who not simply copied empty formulae but modified

  3.2.2 Genitive  Old Nobiin marks the genitive with the suffixes -(i)n and -(i)na. According to
  Browne (2002:33), -n is used if the genitive is closely bound to its noun, -na if
  the union is less close. Final -a presumably represents the predicative (see chap-
  ter 5.2). The genitive regularly precedes its noun, although there are numerous
  exceptions in the texts.
      Closely bound genitives are compound-like nouns such as
  32
(CN. 8.10)
auwi-n = sauno-
ship-GEN     rudder*ship-rudder’but also simple genitives as
(IT HI, 46,1)
sonoj-in      simer-a-lo
eparch-GEN       statement-PRED-EMPH‘it is the Eparch’s statement’These examples are opposed to less close genitive constructions such as
(ChN. 4.18)
iart-na            palkit-la
thought-gen        _sea-into
‘into the sea of thoughts’As the following examples from one of the Qasr Ibrim texts show, it is some-
times impossible to separate the two constructions:
(IT Hf 1878)
[nlod-ina        medjoukanti-ka            ‘slavery of god’

(IT 1 18 ii 2)
[no]d-in      medjoukanti-ka               ‘slavery of god’
god-GEN     _ slavery-OB)The contrast between the two types of genitive is found in the example
(CRN. 19.13-15)

eski-tak-sik-ka                      nal-en-non
conquer-PASS-PARTPRETII-OBJ          see-PARTPRES-and
‘and when he saw the offspring of mankind conquered by the baseness of the devil’Browne (2002:33) interprets the two genitives diabolos-in meert-lojun ‘by the
baseness of the devil’ and ji-n kaui-gu- ‘the offspring of mankind’ as specifying a
mere juncture of rectum and regens. The phrase kaui-gu-na ---- eski-tak-sik-ka
which literally means ‘the offspring’s having been conquered’ must, however, be
regarded as a nexus with kaui-gu-na as the logical subject and eski-tak-sik-ka as
the logical predicate. The Old Nobiin texts show numerous examples of the geni-
                                                                                    33
tive as subject of complement clauses (see chapter 11 on syntax). Nevertheless is
the differentiation described far from being obligatorily.
    In the texts numerous examples with the genitive following its noun are
found, as in
(IT III 40.14)
parre kapop-in              jan-a           dis-sil                       ir-aula          pi-l
land Kapopi-GEN             exchange-ADJ    give to me-PARTPRETII         power-within   — be/lic-PARTPRES
‘(1) sold Kapopi’s land which is within my power’In Modern Nobiin, genitive is marked by the suffixes -n after nouns ending in a
vowel or -in following consonants. The genitive still precedes the noun it de-
pends on and follows the plural suffixes:

aadem-irii-n       bampid                            ‘the people’s speech’

buruu-wii-daauwuur-in-ogji-rii                       ‘the older girls’ men’
girl-PL-old-GEN-man-PLIn his chapter on compound nouns, Werner (1987:96) lists an element -ni(i) with
the meaning of ‘belonging to’. The example given is mug-nii ‘dog meat’ with the
literal meaning of ‘belonging to the dog’ or simply ‘of the dog’.                            This suffix is
described by Lepsius (1880:36ff.) as alternative genitive marker which is em-
ployed if the genitive follows its noun. His examples are from the gospel of St.
Mark:
(GM 2,18)

‘and I want a mosque near the castle [she said] and its minaret higher than my father’s’Contrary to Werner (1987), Lepsius (ibid.) also documented a genitive suffix -na
which the latter regards as a variant of -ni with the function to emphasize (“Her-
vorheben’’) the word.
