"     Bach sentence consists of the same set of words.    They are, however,
     arranged differently.    Each arrangement expresses a different attitude
     by the speaker toward the action that he is talking about.     In the
     first one he is making a simple statement of fact.     In the second
     sentence he is not certain of the fact and is posing it as a question.
     The third sentence expresses his wish that the action be done, and
     forms a command.   These notions and the ways in which they are ex-

                                                    GRAMMAR AND SENTENCE PATTERNS
  In     previous                lessons                you        used      food      items           in    two     sets    of    sentence         patterns.
  You practiced a particular set of food                                                              items with each set of                      sentence
  patterns.   They were not interchanged.                                                              For example, you said
              aka,                     3                -                                                     to
              TonaakUx            ti’             patat.                                                     'This     is    a potato.!
                            but
          T’naroésl                 t{°It               ka’istadka.                                          'This     is    salt.'
  In     English,                the         two        sentences            follow             the     same       pattern;        in     Arikara     they
  an not.                Arikara speakers divide                                     food        into        three     categories;             liquid,
   sranular              and everything else.       t us consider the categories of granular and everything else.   Foods
       ch as salt, beans, the general class meat, roasted corn, pemmican,
  rice        and        cornmeal                 are           made    up   of      particles               or    granules.            When   Arikara
  speakers talk about                                these             foods,        even        one        serving,        they    use     the    plural
  form of the verb.","[48, 49]"
"     Modes are used in Arikara as well as in English.    In Arikara, how-
     ever, modes are expressed by prefixes to the verb.    Different modes
    take different prefixes.    They do not require changes in word order
     in the sentence as in English.    Thus, Arikara and English express
     mode in entirely distinct ways, although the meanings    (or speakei'’s
     attitudes)                  are        the        same.",[285]

verb charts.    These charts consist of a selection of typical verbs that
are used ‘throughout the book-~ones — that are transitive and intransitive,subjects in the singular, dual, and plural numbers.                             They are “given in
three modes: negative, interrogative, and potential.                             The purpose of the
charts    is    to   present   a   variety    of   verbs   in   these       forms     sothat       you   may
learn them and refer to them when studying.   They are also an important
learning device: most of the sound changes that occur in Arikara verbal
inflection are contained in this sample; and when you have mastered this
material, you should be able to inflect new verbs that you learn, making
the correct sound changes.",[14]

    The Arikara          language contains                       sounds      that are both            familiar and     un-
    familiar to          English speakers.                        There      are 22 sounds            in Arikara:
12     consonant          sounds        and     10    vowel         sounds.               Written    Arikara   has   just
22 symbols to represent these sounds, one symbol for each sound.
(A symbol is a letter or mark, or a combination of these.)    Although
Arikara is written in most of the same letters as English, the sound
value for some of the letters is different.   To read and write Arikara
accurately, you must learn the correct symbol for each sound and the
correct          sound     for     each       symbol.
                be asked to relate mos st of the Arikara sounds to
                                                                |  similar
                English sounds.   Keep in mind that this method does not
                give you the true quality of the Arikara sounds, only an
                approximation.   The best way to learn these sounds is to
                study them with an Arikara speaker.","[14, 15]"
"           As        you    progress     through        the        lessons,      you      will   develop       t     a,

Arikara.   By the time you have completed all of the 50 lessons, you will
be able to use your new language skill in talking about one or more
individuals engaged in a variety of activities in the past, present, or
future.   You will know, among other things, the Arikara names for various
tribes, utensils, animals, colors, everyday items of clothing, and how to
greet a person.   You will, moreover, be able to form both simple and
 complex        sentences,
       The lessons begin very simply, taking you one step at a time into
the Arikara language.   Gradually the lessons become more complex, each
one building on what you have learned previously.   This gives you a firm
foundation for the basics and a usable vocabulary.",[13]
