negations; d) '(not) anything' (emphatic negative polarity item). The particle
represents the confluence of various Arabic forms, in some cases perhaps via
Songhay or other African languages. An example in the sense (b) 'even',
where it is dialectally interchangeable with kud, is (696).(696)   war arhe-γ                waeld-dasr       a-haenay-annet

"     The perfective negative corresponds to both simple perfective (PerfP) and
resultative (Resit). This makes sense, since a past negative statement denies
that an event took place over a generous time span, making aspectual
distinctions less useful than in the positive. As a result, (638.a) negates both
PerfP assasn-aer Ί knew, found out' and the more common Resit assan-aer Ί
know' (stative).
     The normal imperfective negative construction consists of waer and a
special LoImpfN stem (a negative variant of LoImpfP). The LoImpfN blocks
the ablaut accent χ and the first-syllable full-V feature χ that appear in the
LoImpfP, while allowing final-syllable χ and all consonantal adjustments
found in the LoImpfP (prefix -t-, gemination). The LoImpfN also has strict
«Η» melody, while the LoImpfP has «Η» or «L» melody depending on verb
class (§7.2.5.1).
     To negate an imperfective, we get waer plus a special LoImpfN stem that
is related to, but distinct from, the LoImpfP. For the future negative see §9.1.4
below. The negative imperative (=prohibitive) includes waer but the stem-
choice is somewhat complex; see §7.2.4.4.(639)   war           l-baddad

        'He is not standing/stopping.' (= 'He doesn't stand/stop.')     In (639), -baddad- is the LoImpfN corresponding to LoImpfP -baddaed-.
The basic form of the verb is -vbdvd- (PerfP -abdaed-).
     For special forms like wasdden used in biclausal negatives ('it is not the
case that [...]'), see §9.5.
     Forms used as negative polarity items (like 'anything' in 'not ...
anything') include ordinary generic nouns like ae-wadam 'person', haeraet
'thing', and e-daegg 'place', but also the specialized and somewhat emphatic
polarity form waeld 'nothing' (nonhuman). Its extension waela ""iy-aen 'not
(even) one, none at all' can be added to any NP. For abstractions and other
mass nouns, waeld andasrr-asn 'not (even) a little' can be used. The form
waeld, in other contexts, has a range of uses from emphatic 'even' to
disjunctive 'or'. A more general '(not) at all' polarity item is the interjection-

"    It is also possible to put the possessor in subject position with transitive
verb -νΐυ- 'have' (§9.1.3, and for the irregular morphology §7.3.2.13). One
can further extract the object of this verb, e.g. as a 'what?' interrogative, the
effect being to approximate a predicate genitive ('what does X have?' = 'what
belongs to X?').

               definite demonstrative     participle         ablaut change    In (8.a), a morphophonological rule Prefix Reduction (e.g. -a- reduced to
-as-, or -i- reduced to -a-) applies to nouns in combinations with specific
preceding forms. Of special interest is the fact that reduction applies to the
12    2 Overviewverb-subject sequence, but not to a verb-object sequence. For more on the
role this plays in ""case marking,"" see §2.3, below.
    For verbs, the only true local dependency is that of an inflected verb on a
preceding Negative (8.b). This applies in all combinations where no elements
(other than floating clitics) intervene between the two, hence to perfective,
(long) imperfective, and imperative (i.e. prohibitive) stems. Basically the
modification converting Y to Y' adds phonetic content (where it is not
vacuous) in the perfective, reduces phonetic content (erasing a V-length ablaut
formative χ-pcl and an accent ablaut formative χ-pcl) in the imperfective and
prohibitive, and modifies the stem vocalism in all of these stems.
    The cases in (8.c) are limited to definite relative clauses, which begin
with a definite demonstrative (in apposition to the head NP, which if overtly
expressed is external to the clause). The modification in ablaut form of the
verb involves erasure of a V-length ablaut formative (χ-pcl), and (with
specific exceptions) a shift in the location of the ablaut accent formative (in
one combination, this formative is entirely erased). The formulation of the
relevant rules requires an extraordinary interpenetration of ""syntax"" and
""phonology,"" and constitutes an important empirical argument against highly
modularized theories of grammar.
    It is possible to combine two [X Y'...] configurations, as in the
combination [Negative verb noun(subject) ...]. In this combination, the
relevant pairs involving local dependencies are [Negative verb] and [verb
noun(subject)]. As a result, internal bracketing as in [Negative [verb
noun(subject)] ...] or [[Negative verb] noun(subject) ...] is counterproductive
(any such bracketing would appear to separate two forms that enter into a local
dependency). The only points that matter are adjacency (disregarding clitics)
and the grammatical relationship (e.g. Negative + verb, or verb +
noun(subject).
    Superficially similar cases are those in (9)(9)     [X Y'...] Dependencies Not Requiring Adjacency        X                     Y'          modification in Y'        Future particle       verb        Short Imperfective
        complementizer        verb        Short Imperfective    The cases in (9) involve either a Future particle or a particular type of
complementizer, plus an inflected ""Short Imperfective"" form. The latter cannot
be used clause-initially with its usual subject pronominal inflections. However,
the short imperfective is related to the positive imperative (which has no
morphological connection to the prohibitive). The positive imperative is
clause-initial (hence is preceded by no ""X"" element), and it lacks the usual
subject pronominals.
                                                                   2.2 Nouns      13     Importantly, while the [X Y' ...] depencies in (8) require direct adjacency
(except that they allow floating clitics to be hosted by X), the dependency of
the Short Imperfective on the Future particle or on the complementizer in (9)
can extend to a second short imperfective clause appended to the first one,
with no repetition of the X element. Thus [Future Shlmpf,, Shlmpf 2 ] is
grammatical, where both verbs are under the scope of the Future morpheme
(cf. English he will come, and eat). No confusion is likely, since the Shlmpf
cannot be used in the absence of a dependency. In other words, a Shlmpf can
be triggered by a variable-distance dependency; compare the concept of
""serie enchainee"" adapted from other Berberist literature to Tuareg by Leguil
(1992:43). By contrast, we cannot get e.g. #[Neg Verb,, Verty where both
verbs are under the scope of the negator; the correct expression is [Neg Verb,,
Neg Verb2] with the negator repeated, since adjacency is required in local
dependencies.","[30, 31, 32]"

9.5 External negation and negative copular clausesIn addition to the normal clause-intemal negation, expressed with waer as a
preverbal particle (§9.6.2), there is an external negative element (arguably
segmentable) with the dialectal variants indicated in (633).",[604]

                 LoImpfN [long imperfective negative] (after Neg waer)
                 Prohib [prohibitive] (after Neg waer)    For example, 'get' has PerfP -sjraew-, Shlmpf -sjrew-, and LoImpfP
-jamew-. The perfective and short imperfective subsystems generally differ
only in vocalism, while the long imperfective subsystem is characterized by
consonantal (as well as vocalic) ablaut features.
    Some of these stems can occur clause-initially, but others (PerfN, Shlmpf,
LoImpfN, Prohib) occur only after a preverbal particle (for the Shlmpf the
relevant particle need not be adjacent). The specifically negative stems occur
after Negative preverb waer. The Shlmpf stem is used after Future ad and in
some other dependent positions.
    The Resit is very common, and in many cases can be translated as a
present-tense stative verb in English ('know', 'be sitting'). The LoImpfP
denotes recurring or habitual events, as well as progressives ('be dancing').
    For morphological purposes, it is necessary to distinguish numerous verb
classes, based on their basic stem shape, e.g. -vPQvC- or -CuCCu- (+ -t). See
§2.11, below, for the notation. Two important factors in verbal morphology are
the heaviness of the stem (light, middleweight, or superheavy, the latter two
subsumed under ""heavy""); the presence of any full V ' s initially, medially, or
finally; and (for V-final) stems whether the verb takes Augment -t.
     Participles, which agree in number and gender (but not person), are used
in subject relatives. They can be formed from those non-imperative verb stems
that occur clause-initially (PerfP, Resit, LoImpfP). In combinations involving a
preverbal particle, the Participial affix can be added to the particle, the details
depending on dialect. Modifying adjectives are a special case of intransitive
participle.
    Essentially all verbs have a Verbal Noun (VblN) formed by ablaut. A
large number of verbs also have an Agentive. There are a number of less
productive nominalization patterns confined to a few verbs.
    Valency-changing derivations include causative, mediopassive, passive,
and reciprocal. These categories are expressed by derivational prefixes with
some associated ablaut changes. Causative and passive are especially
productive, and layered derivations (e.g. passive of causative) are very
common. Each such derived verb has its own full set of stems of type (12), as
well as participles and a VblN.","[34, 35]"

The two variants also interact differently with participial endings (§8.5.6.2).","[609, 610]"
"
3.5.2.2   Verbs after Negative particlesThe basic Negative preverb is waer, used in all MAN combinations (e.g.
perfective, imperfective, imperative). In all of the interactions described below,
the Neg preverb must be adjacent to the affected verb.
     In the perfective, if the verb stem is bisyllabic and ends in ...aeC-, the ae is
converted to e. Bisyllabic V-final verbs, i.e. those of the shape -vC(C)i> or
-uC(C)i>, allow this vocalic substitution to apply in combinations where the
stem-final full V appears as se in combination with a subject suffix. The
modified stem with e is the PerfN (perfective negative) stem, and is part of the
""perfective system."" For other verbs, and for -vC(C)i> or -OC(C)D- verbs with
no subject suffix, the PerfN is indistinguishable from the PerfP (perfective
positive).
     The modification in the PerfN is treated formally here as the effect of an
ablaut formative e - p c l f (§3.4.4, §7.2.2.3), where e targets the first
postconsonantal short V if this V is also stem-final in the sense indicated. Note
that this stem-modification is additive (i.e. it increases phonological
markedness) rather than reductive.
     In the imperfective (indicative), the only stem that can directly follow the
Neg particle is the long imperfective. In comparison with the positive form
(LoImpfP), the negative counterpart (LoImpfN) is characterized by <H>
melody, and by the absence of the ablaut features that lengthen and accent the
first postconsonantal V in the LoImpfP, i.e. χ-pcl and χ-pcl. Since the
LoImpfP can have <L> or <H> melody depending on its syllabic shape, the
melodic difference between LoImpfP and LoImpfN is audible only for those
verbs whose LoImpfP has <L> melody. Example: 'destroy', with LoImpfP
-hdllaek- and LoImpfN -hsllak-. These two forms differ in having <L> versus
<H> melody, and in that -hallsek- has an accented full ά while -halbk- has no
full V and no marked accent. For more on long imperfectives see §7.2.5.
     In the imperative, there are two options for negation. One is to use the
same PerfN form described above, so 'don't-Sg eat!' is identical to 'you-Sg
didn't eat'. The other is to use a stem of the long imperfective family, with the
same vocalic melody as the LoImpfP, but without the formatives χ-pcl and
χ-pcl. I refer to this stem as the Prohibitive]. Thus 'don't-Sg destroy!' can be
152     3 Phonologyexpressed as either wser t-ahlek (with PerfN stem, note the e) or as wasr
haellaek (with the Prohib). For more on these negative imperatives see §7.2.5.3.

                        Hortative (Hort)     The three ""systems"" are based on morphology, not (just) on meaning.
     The Imprt has special 2Sg, 2MaPl, and 2FePl forms. All other stems are
inflectable in the sense that they can take the full set of pronominal subject
prefixes and suffixes. A minor exception is that special perfectives of many
adjectival verbs can take subject suffixes but not prefixes.
     In French-language scholarship, the Resit is often referred to as ""l'intensif
de raccompli."" Likewise, the LoImpfP is referred to as ""l'intensif de
l'inaccompli."" The two ""intensives"" have some ablaut features in common,
namely χ-pcl (accent) and χ-pcl (V-lengthening).
     I use ""long imperfective"" to designate a set of stems characterized by
ablaut formatives including at least one consonantal increment (prefixation of
-t- or internal gemination). The short imperfectives and the perfectives lack
these consonantal increments; they are distinguished from each other by stem
vocalism, except that adjectival verbs often have an irregular perfective stem.
The basic grammatical difference between the Shlmpf and the LoImpfP is that
the Shlmpf functions as a dependent form, either preceded by a Future particle
or occurring in add-on clauses following an independent clause. The English
present tense of stative verbs ('they know', 'it is green') usually translates into
Tamashek as Resit (rather than LoImpfP). The LoImpfP is therefore typically
used for habitual aspect, and for ongoing activities (e.g. progressives).
     Inflectable verb stems take default accents, with three exceptions. First,
an ablaut accent formative occurs in the Resit (but not other perfective) and
LoImpfP (but not other long imperfective) stems (§7.2.2.2, §7.2.5.1). Second,
unaugmented V-final verb forms combine with V-initial suffixes to produce
words with surface penultimate accent, suggesting both the stem-final V and
the suffix-initial V are counted for purposes of Default Accentuation (though
they are later contracted into a single surface V); see §3.3.1.2 and §7.3.1.3-4.
This is compatible with Default Accentuation, but the latter must apply at a
pre-surface level. Third, these unaugmented V-final verbs undergo Stem-Final
i/A-Deletion (29) (§3.1.2.4) in the short imperfectives, and for a subset of
these verbs (specifically, the light stems, e.g. -vCCi>), the resulting stem-final
CC cluster is resyllabified (Final-CC Schwa-Insertion (44), §3.2.4); in the T-ka
dialect this resyllabification entails a shift of accent to the inserted schwa (i.e.
onto the stem-final syllable); see §3.3.1.2, §7.3.1.3. With these exceptions,
inflected verb stems (and inflected forms) are transcribed below with default
accent (""v""). If an unaccented inflected verb has fewer than three syllables, a
phrasal accent will appear on any preceding particles within the accentual
phrase. Thusl-bsa 'he vomited', negative war i-bsa 'he did not vomit' with
phrasal accent on the Neg particle.

capable of occurring clause-initially (PerfP, Resit, LoImpfP), but have a
special set of MaSg, FeSg, and PI suffixes instead of the usual pronominal
subject prefixes and suffixes, see §8.5. For verbal nouns (VblN), agentives
(Agent), and other purely nominal derivatives, see §8.8-11.
    For most (nonadjectival) light stems, the stem-shape is basically consistent
in PerfP, Imprt, and Shlmpf, e.g. -vPQvi- or -vPPvC-. With heavy stems that
do not have a full V in the first Imprt syllable, there is variation in surface
shape of the onset, with PvC... in the Imprt corresponding to either -vPQ... or
-vPPvQ... (depending on syllabic structure) in the perfectives and short
imperfectives. I take the Imprt to be indicative of the lexical representation of
the stems. Both the -vPQ... and -vPPvQ... onsets require a rule of Stem-Initial
V-insertion. In addition, -vPQ... requires a rule of Stem-Initial Syncope,
while -vPPvQ... requires a rule of Q-Gemination. On these rules, see §3.4.8.","[318, 319, 320]"

the relative clause (here, a head noun in the indefinite construction), even
when a preverbal particle like waer- is present.
    T-ka and R have the same basic grammar for negative participles. They
diverge, however, in future (and future negative) participles, to which we now
turn.

positive utterances. The Future Negative is expressed in T-ka by u - m a r
(presumably fused from *wasr mar), in R and some other dialects by w $ r
followed by Future allomorph e. In effect, a d is confined to clause-initial
position and is replaced by mar or e when non-initial
    For T-ka, the combinations of (noninitial) Future particle m a r with
participial endings are given in (522).","[515, 516]"

                              Introduction
1.1 Tuareg and Berber linguisticsThe Berber family is part of the Afro-Asiatic (or Hamito-Semitic) phylum (1).","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"
7.3.2.11     ExistentialAocational 'be' (Vl)The defective verb -νΐΐυ- occurs only in the perfective system. In positive
utterances, Resit -alia- is normal, although PerfP -alia- is attested after Past
preverbal particle kaeld, see (424.g), below. In negatives, the stem appears as
(PerfN) -alia-. It may be translated 'exist', 'be present', or 'be here'. The
emphasis is on existence, or on presence as opposed to absence (in a
presupposed location such as 'here'). The locational element in translation ('be
here') is best considered a pragmatic implicature, and -νΐΐυ- is not used in
expressions like 'be in (a box, a city)' where the locational is part of the
argument frame. Unmarked time reference is to the present, or to a timeless
(gnomic) status, unless Past particle kaeld precedes the verb. These temporal
and aspectual features are mostly shared with 'be in' and 'have' (see just
below). For additional information on the morphosyntax of this verb see §9.3.
422     7 Verbal morphology    For T-ka and some other dialects, -νΐΐυ- is syntactically transitive, but the
""object"" is an invariant 3MaSg clitic (allomorphs -\e, -\t, etc.), and in some
combinations this clitic is optionally dropped. For these dialects, the clitic is
nonreferential. When the Negative preverbal particle is present, the clitic (as
usual) follows thie Negative particle. Examples showing the clitic are in (424).","[440, 441]"
"    When the jussive clause is negated, it switches to hortative form, with no
complementizer. The clause begins with Neg waer followed by a verb in the
Prohibitive stem with suffix -et. This was checked for T-ka and R (817.a-b). I
did, however, record one instance of a regular (unsubordinated) future negative
complement in my brief study of Im dialect (817.c).(817)   a.      anne-rAa-s                   [war i-nsezzzer-et]

                Ί told him not to come.' [Im]    For the K-d speaker, negative jussives use direct quotation. Therefore the
negative jussive clause is identical in form to a (second-person subject)
negative imperative. My K-d examples show the negative imperative type that
uses a PerfN verb (818).(818)   anne-rAa-s                    [war       t-attes-asdl
        say.PerfP-lSgSADat-3Sg [Neg              2S-sleep(Vds).PerfN-2SgS]

        [lit. ""I told him, don't you-Sg sleep!""]
676      13 Clausal subordination13.3.1        'want' (-vrhi>)a - \ d is also found with -vrhu- 'want'. Below are examples with positive
(819.a) and negative (819.b-c) complements. The alternative is a VblN
complement. This is the case in (819.d), which negates the higher 'want' verb.(819)    a.         i-rhd                  [a-\d             n-snzsr]

13.3.2     'be able' (-dubu- + -t) and 'prefer' (-suf-)-dubi> (+ -t) 'be able' (820.a-e) takes Shlmpf verbs in the complement, while
-suf- 'prefer' (820.f) can take e.g. LoImpfP and Resit verbs. (820.a) shows the
usual dropping of the cliticized preposition Ad when another clitic is present.
(820.e) has a negation in each of the main and subordinated clauses. (820.f)
shows the use of a LoImpfP complement to specify an extended time span.(820)    a.         wasr       seddobe-r

                Ί prefer that they-Ma surround (=stay close to) me.' [K]    In the somewhat awkward double negative example (820.b), the T-ka
informant also allowed a-\s with cliticized Instrumental preposition as an
alternative to dAd. He did not accept this substitution in the positive
complement in (820.a).
    These verbs ('can', 'prefer') may also take VblN complements (§13.6.8).","[694, 695, 696]"
"    YQS after one clause, followed closely by another clause, can indicate
temporal proximity of the two events (§13.1.1.4).
    The alternative construction involves a negated clause, followed by an
add-on phrase (small clause) with ar 'except' and the highlighted constituent.
(For a version with ssel instead of ar, see §11.3.2, below.) This ar is a particle
rather than a true preposition and does not induce Prefix Reduction on a
following noun.(699)    a.      war      l-tatt                      ar        1-s-an

followed by ar and a VblN specifying the concrete event type. Note that
although t-e-taete is the logical subject of 'occupy', the latter has default
3MaSg subject rather than 3FeSg agreement, and t-e-taete does not show
Prefix Reduction as it would if it were a true syntactic subject.
    In (700.b), ar is followed by a complete clause, if dd here is the Future
particle.
    In R dialect, ar is also a particle meaning 'until' or 'all the way to', but in
T-ka and other dialects the 'until' particle is har (§13.1.1.5).
11.3.2 'other than'(ssel)The particle sael occurs in a construction of the type '(an) X other than Y'
where X is a noun (normally indefinite in sense) and Y is an NP with more
specific reference. If X is not expressed by a regular noun, the minimal
demonstrative ά can be used, sael is not a preposition, and a following noun
does not undergo Prefix Reduction.(701)   a.       daer      ae-kall       sael       [w-α               naesasn]
                 [in       Sg-land]      other.than [Ma-Dem.Sg         lPlPoss]

                 'He eats (foods) other than meat.'     (70l.b) is noncommital as to whether the person in question eats meat. It
specifies that what he eats is not limited to meat.
     ssel also occurs in the fixed temporal phrase d-sal wen sael a-sskka 'the
day after tomorrow', lit. 'that day there other than tomorrow'.
     ssel can occur in constructions of the type 'not..., except X' (i.e. 'only X'),
cf. §11.3.1, above.(702)   ά-di     waer-\hl-\tt                    i-rsed

        'So, nobody ruined it for me, other than father.' [K]
11.3.3 'also, too, again' (dar)The phrase-final particle d a r (in T-ka also heard as daev) is very common. Its
basic sense is 'also, in addition', with 'again' as a more contextual translation.

11.3.4 'still'(har w-ά)har w-ά 'until this-Ma' is a frozen expression meaning 'still', i.e.
'(continuously) until now'. In A-grm I heard this as haerwd, with shortened
first V, no longer transparently segmentable. For other senses of har w-ά, see
§11.3.5, below, and (795) in §13.1.1.4. For har 'until' see §13.1.1.5.(704)   har            w-ά               i-rhln

11.3.5 'not yet' (har w-ά, saedder, and!)There are two basic constructions for 'not yet'. The first is of the syntactic type

may be clause-initial or -final (705.a-b). The second construction also involves
a negation, but uses sasdder (dialectally saedden) '(not) yet' clause-finally
(705.c). The variation between saedder and saedden resembles that between
negative predicator wasdder and wasdden (633) (§9.5), though the dialectal
range of the rare variant ssedden is much more limited than than for the variant
wsedden.(705)   a.      wser-\d           0-osa                     har     w-ά

"     It is not possible to add a second verb under the scope of a Negative
particle in the first clause. In such contexts, the second verb has its own
Negative particle (830.a). This is true even in (830.b) where the second verb is
in PerfN form, i.e. is indexed as negated. However, if the second clause is
positive and already effectively subordinated to a preceding clause, so that the
two form a single proposition, it may remain attached without change when the
first clause is negated; in (830.c), the final LoImpfP clause is a kind of serial
adjunct to the 'go to' clause and is therefore included in the scope of the higher
negation.(830)   a.      [wser        n-sksa]             [wser      n-aswa]

set of entities exhorted or permitted to undertake the activity is indexed in the
grammatical subject. For example, if there is one speaker and one addressee,
'let's go!' has 1P1 subject.
     In the alternative construction to which we now turn, a 1P1 dative clitic is
added to an imperative. The overt subject of the imperative is Sg or PI
depending on the number of persons in question, excluding the speaker. This
imperative verb is followed by a 1 PI dative clitic, even if only two persons
(speaker and addressee) are present. The 1P1 dative can therefore be taken as
subsuming the 2nd person subject of the imperative. In this construction, 'let's
go!' for two persons (1st dual inclusive) is expressed as 'go!-Sg for us'. On the
other hand, 'let's go!' for three or more persons is expressed as 'go!-Pl for us',
the imperative being 2MaPl or 2FePl according to the sex of the addressees
(and any other included non-speaker referent). Data in (327) are valid for at
least T-ka and R dialects.","[341, 342]"

8.5.6      Participles built on preverbal particles8.5.6.1     Participles with Negative w&rSubject relatives with a negation are constructed by participializing (i.e. adding
Participial suffixes to) the Negative particle waer. The MaSg is -aen and the
FeSg is -aet as in simple verb participles, but the PI ending is now also -aen
(homophonous with the MaSg), as seen in (515). In K-f, the Participial suffixes
lose their short V, resulting in PI and MaSg n- and FeSg t-. In Im dialect, n-
generalizes from Masg and PI to FeSg, and is prosodically part of the
following verb.",[512]
"
7.2.2   Perfective systemThe Perfective Positive (PerfP) is used for temporally bounded events in the
past (i.e. events that ended prior to the ""now"" of the speech act, or some other
contextually established deictic center). The PerfP is the basic form of the
perfective system, and the other two perfective-system stems are built on it.
    The Resultative (Resit), which adds accent and length formatives to the
PerfP, is used when the perfective event results in a situation or state, and
depending on the verb can be translated as a stative present ('knows') or as a
perfect ('has already arrived'). It can often be translated loosely as present
progressive ('is red', 'is burning'), but this does not capture the actual
tense/aspect nuance of Tamashek, which specifies a situation or state that
results from an event or state that began earlier (and may or may not be
complete, depending on the verb).
    The Perfective Negative (PerfN) is formed by adding an ablaut formative
changing ae in the PerfP to e. Except for light verbs ending in CvC, this
formative has no audible effect, in which case the PerfN is indistinguishable
from the PerfP. The PerfN is used, after Negative preverbal particle wser, to
negate either the PerfP or the Resit. It must directly follow wser with no
intervening material other than clitics.
     Both the PerfP and the Resit have participial forms used in subject
relatives. The PerfN lacks its own participial form, since the relevant subject
relative is formed by adding a Participial ending directly to the Neg particle
preceding the PerfN verb.
302       7 Verbal morphology7.2.2.1     Perfective Positive stem (PerfP)The PerfP is the normal positive verb form for completed events. The time
reference is therefore normally past (with respect to the here-and-now). No
other marking of past time reference is needed. The PerfP can also be used in
exhortations (prayers) with 'God' as subject.
     All PerfP stems are lexically unaccented. Unless an accented directional
clitic is present, the word-form built on the PerfP stem gets the default accent.
     Examples are in (308), giving the unmarked (i.e. Sg) Imperative (Imprt)
for comparison. Phonetic representations in brackets show the effects of BLC's
and/or monophthongization of homorganic diphthongs.","[320, 321]"
"     In (648.a), ύ-mar functions as a unit and precedes the clitic. This is the
most common pattern. In (648.b), ύ-mar is replaced by the more transparent
waer ... mar, with the clitic intervening. (648.c) is like (648.b) except that we
get waer ... u-mar with the fused form ü - m a r after the clitic. In this case, the
fusion of ύ-mar is such that it can be taken as a variant Fut allomorph used in
negative contexts.
     For R (which however prefers waer ... e) I have also heard a variant Neg +
Fut form a m m a r instead of ü-mar. This results in an even more opaque form
hardly worthy of hyphenation. An example is a m m a r i-saw 'he will not
drink'.
     The Diebok dialect near Gao was not investigated in detail, but the two
examples in (649) were obtained for this dialect from literacy specialists in
Gao. It appears that - s a - is a Future element fused with Neg waer, much as
- m a r - is for T-ka. In (649.b), it appears that - s a - is reduced to -s- before a
V-initial verb, but the overall allomorphy and its morphosyntactic distribution
are not clear to me.(649)   a.       waer-sa-\dd               0-as

594     9 Verb phrases and other predications9.7 Verbs borrowed from FrenchFrench verbs are not borrowed as inflectable verbs. Instead, the borrowed verb
stem is accompanied by the verb -vju- 'do' functioning as an auxiliary. The
borrowed stem generally ends in e, which can be taken as a composite of the
productive French infinitive -er, participial -e, ""vous"" form -ez, and perhaps
the imperfective (-ait, etc.). The borrowed verb functions as direct object of
-vju-. If the sense calls for a real object, this appears as a dative (650.a).(650)    a.     je-Y-\a-s2en                      repdse

                                  Clitics
10.1 Sentential cliticsClitics are normally realized at the end of the first word (perhaps a preverbal
particle or a verb) in the relevant clause (for occasional repetition of a
directional clitic on a noninitial word, see below). The clause onset for this
purpose excludes the following: a) topicalized NP or adverb (preverbal); b)
focalized NP or adverb; and c) the head noun in a definite relative (the
following demonstrative functions as clause-initial). Certain sentence-initial
particles like musam 'but' are also disregarded. When a preverbal particle
hosts a directional clitic, this clitic is optionally repeated on the following verb
as in (655) and (662) below, but other clitics are not doubled in this way.
     Clitics include directionals (§10.2), object and dative pronominals (§10.3),
pronominal PPs, and (in extraction constructions) cliticized prepositions. For
details on the relative ordering of clitics, see §10.4.
     The double symbol -\ is used to indicate the boundary between a clitic and
a preceding stem, suffix, or clitic. I use this since it can be typed within the
phonetic font used here and in the dictionary.","[612, 613, 614]"

9.6.2   Negative (war)The clause-internal Neg particle weer is used in any aspect-mood combination,
though it requires adjustments in the form of the following verb stem. It is
heard as [war] directly before {a u i} by Short-V Harmony (46), and as [waer]
before any other V or C. For some T-ka speakers, the r is dropped in
conversational style when followed by a clitic beginning t, as in waeAtaen i-ha
haeraet 'there is nothing in them'.
    In the perfective, light C-final PerfP verb stems with /as/ in the second
syllable undergo PerfN ablaut after waer, replacing the /ae/ by e (§7.2.2.3), due
to ablaut formative 6-pelf (638.a). For heavy stems, the PerfN and the PerfP
(used in positive constructions) are homophonous (638.b), since the e-pclf
formative has no audible manifestation (638.b).(638)   a.      war     assen-aev

9.6.4   Combinations of preverbsThe relative ordering in T-ka is Past + Neg + Fut. To my knowledge Past and
Fut do not co-occur, so the attested combinations are Past + Neg and Neg +
Fut.
     Past + Neg is not particularly common, since the simple perfective is the
common translation equivalent of English past negatives ('he did not go', 'she
was not sick'). The combination ksela wasr plus PerfN stem (which is
sometimes homophous to the PerfP) is used to denote a temporally extended
negative state, and can be generalized as an experiential negation 'not ever'.

pattern is characteristic of verbs that are basically adjectival in nature. This
confirms the need for a grammatical distinction between nonadjectival (310.a)
and adjectival (310.b). In (310.c), the marked accent is audible but lengthening
(if present) is not, since the V in question is already a full V. The surface forms
in (310.c) therefore give us no clue as to which stems belong with the
nonadjectival verbs in (310.a), and which belong with the adjectival verbs in
(310.b). Presumably those with adjectival sense, like 'be brown', belong with
(310.b), but there is no way to prove this empirically.
     In (310.d-f), we have an i in the Resit. As I analyse these forms, the i is the
result of applying χ-pcl to /a/ (after Melodic Association), where the relevant
schwa is the overt or underlying ν following the first C position of the stem.
For example, 'raise (child)' in (310.d) is -rvbbu- and 'be joyful' in (310.f) is
-hvlvylvy- in their basic lexical representation, and the first short ν is targeted
by χ-pcl, resulting in -arribba- and -ahllasylaey- after all rules have applied. In
308     7 Verbal morphology(310.g), there is already a full V in the relevant position, so χ-pcl applies
vacuously.
     In (310.e-g), because the V targeted by χ-pcl happens to be the antepenult
or earlier, this grammatical accent is overridden by Default Accentuation. In
(310.e-f) at least χ-pcl is audible in the form of the i vowel, but in (3lO.g)
there is no audible difference between the PerfP and the Resit.
     In (310.b-c), the only audible distinguishing feature of the Resit is the
accent, either because χ-pcl is suspended (adjectival verbs) or because the
targeted V in question is already full so χ-pcl has no audible effect. If suffixes
and/or clitics are added to Resit verbs of types (310.b-c), so that the
grammatical accent χ-pcl is overridden by Default Accentuation (or by an
accented directional clitic), there is again no audible difference between PerfP
and Resit.
     As detailed in §3.5.3.1, §8.5.2, and §12.1, χ-pcl is erased in Resit verbs
and Resit participles in definite relative clauses. This eliminates the
distinguishing i in (310.d-f), and the distinctive lengthening of the final-
syllable stem-vowel in (310.a). However, the erasure does not affect χ-pcl (i.e.
accent), so certain types of verbs maintain the PerfP/Reslt opposition even in
definite relative clauses, viz., the verbs in (310.a-d), provided that the accented
V is in the penult or final of the word and is not followed by an accented
directional clitic or by a suffix that forces penultimate accent.
     In light V-final stems, i.e. -VC(C)u- (V = short or full vowel, υ = full
vowel), e.g. 'go to' in (309.c) with PerfP -skka- and Resit -akkd-, the only
difference is accent when no subject suffix is added: 3MaSg PerfP 1-kka, Resit
i-kkd. However, when subject suffixes are added to light V-final verbs, the
suffix creates an environment that permits χ-pcl (in addition to χ-pcl) to
apply. Thus 3MaPl PerfP Skkae-n (with Presuffixal α-Shortening (112) and
VV-Contraction (37.d)) and Resit a k k d - n , 3FePl akkae-naet and Resit
skkd-naet, where the Resit forms have a lengthened as well as accented stem-
final ά. For all other verb types, including heavy V-final verbs and all C-final
verbs, suffixes are not a factor in ablaut. This shows that the scope of ablaut,
in the case of light V-final verbs, consists of the stem plus up to the first
suffixal C, hence all of 3MaPl /akka-aen/, and all of 3FePl /akka-nast/ except
the final ast. In §7.2.2.3, below, we will see that the same definition of domain
works for PerfN ablaut.
    In causatives, a Resit stem beginning in -s-ί... might be mistaken (by a
non-native speaker) for a LoImpfP. This is because many causative LoImpfP
forms begin in -s-ί... . However, the Resit stem will always have a low V at
least in its final syllable, while a LoImpfP stem beginning with i (i.e. with <H>
melody) will have high vowels through to the end of the stem.
    Examples of the resultative are in (311).(311)    a.      t-3dds-\taen                   t-orhanna η           ""a-sni

7.2.2.3    Perfective Negative stem (PerfN)Negation is expressed in all aspect-mood categories by the preverb wser, which
undergoes Short-V Harmony to war when immediately followed by a high
vowel {u a i}. Both the PerfP and the Resit of positive sentences are negated
by a single form that is here labeled PerfN (Perfective Negative). For example,
both PerfP sssaen-aer Ί knew, found out', and the much more common Resit
sssdn-aev Ί know', are negated as war assen-aer Ί don't know' or Ί didn't
know'.
    Curiously, the same combination of waer plus PerfN verb that is used to
negative the PerfP or Resit is also used as a prohibitive (i.e., negative
imperative) 'don't VERB!'. There is no audible difference, even at clause
level, between the prohibitive and perfective negative readings. However,
there is an alternative prohibitive construction consisting of waer plus the
Prohibitive] stem, which belongs to the long imperfective system. See
§7.2.5.3 for both types of prohibitive.
    The PerfN is formed from the PerfP by adding a single ablaut formative
that is realized (if at all) as an e vowel. I label this e -pelf. This formative is
expressed audibly only in light stems ending in ...CaeC-, where it appears in
the second syllable. Otherwise the PerfN is homophonous to the PerfP. The
basic morphological data are given in (312).

which are light and C-final, with ae in the second syllable of the PerfP. (These
are the same verbs that express both χ-pcl and χ-pcl audibly in the Resit.)
     In (312.b), the stems are light V-final verbs, i.e. -V(C)Cu- with the length
of the first V variable. These verbs do not distinguish PerfN from PerfP in the
unsuffixed forms shown in the table, hence PerfP 1-ksa 'he ate', negated as
war i-ksa 'he did not eat'. However, these verbs do distinguish PerfN from
PerfP if one of the PI -asC or -CaeC subject suffixes, e.g. 3MaPl -aen or 3FePl
-naet, is present. This is because, for PerfN ablaut as for Resit ablaut (see
§7.2.2.2, above), the initial asC of subject suffixes is included, for with light
V-final verbs, in the scope of ablaut. For example, the 3MaPl (suffix -asn)
occurs in PerfP alhae-n 'they wept' (cf. Resit alhd-n), which is negated as war
slhe-n, while the 3FePl (suffix -naet) has PerfP alhas-naet, negated as war
Mhe-nast. See the full paradigm of the PerfN for the similar verb -ojja- 'weep'

suffixes are not within the scope of ablaut.
    In (312.c), the verb is too heavy to be affected by e - p c l f . In (312.d), the
PerfP does not end in ...CaeC-. Causative -aes-saer- 'depilate' looks as though it
ought to be amenable to e - p c l f , but it is syncopated from -...s-vsvr- and
therefore counts as heavy rather than light.
    In summary, the effect of e - p c l f is to insert e replacing a short ae of the
PerfP, when this is the first postconsonantal V and is also the final V.
    (313) shows that a clitic may intervene between Neg waer and the PerfN
verb.(313)     a.      waer-\t£en         i-jrew                      ^-sni ?

7.2.3     Short imperfective systemThe Shlmpf stem is closely related morphologically to the Imprt (used in
positive imperatives) stem. There is a short hortative form based on the Shlmpf
stem. I discuss the inflected Shlmpf and Imprt stems, and the short hortative
forms, in this section before turning to the long imperfective system.
    Stative aspect with present time reference is normally expressed by the
Resit stem in the perfective system. Therefore ""imperfective"" is used here for a
more limited temporal/aspectual range than in other languages where
imperfective stems are required with present time reference.","[325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]"

14.1.3 Gender and plural agreementThe agreement site for a Tamashek NP may be to the left (verbal subject
agreement) or to the right (participles, including ""modifying adjectives"").
     In conjunctions ('and'), left agreement is confined to the features of the
left coordinand, as in (883.a-b), where the clause-initial verb shows subject
agreement with the left coordinand. Right agreement is summative (hence
always plural), as in (883.c) where the participle agrees with the sum of 'ewe'
and 'goat'. (883.d) shows the same pattern, but not necessarily true clause-
internal agreement, since a preverbal ""subject"" NP (here 'bull with cow')
could be considered to be a pre-sentential topical constituent that is ""resumed""
by a plural pronominal in the core sentence itself. In (883), only nouns that are
factors in agreement are bolded.

"     A subject or object noun (but not both) can form an accentual phrase with
a preceding verb. Default and secondary accents are applied from right to left.
Thus, in (13), [anhsey-ajn medd-aen] is an accentual phrase, with a lexical
accent on the e of medd-asn and a secondary accent on the second syllable to
its left. In isolation, the verb is anhaey-aen with default accent on the
antepenult. If the noun medd-aen is omitted in (13), we would get [anhsey-asn
elu], where the object noun now forms an accentual phrase with the verb. Two
adjacent nouns are never grouped accentually, so as (13) stands elu has no
accentual interaction with medd-aen.
     If the clause is future or negative, there is a preverbal particle (Future ad or

example, Future e (or: he) is doubled, occurring once before and once after
Negative waer. The Future particle occurs only once in the other types, before
Neg in the (ii) examples and after it in the (iii) examples. The (iii) examples
appear to be most common for the R informant, and it is consistent with the
usual ordering (Neg Fut) in non-relative clauses. The (i) and (ii) types are
therefore anomalous. They may reflect difficulty in hearing Fut e before MaSg
subject prefix i- in (526.a.iii), a difficulty that can be resolved by adding
another (h)e before the Neg particle.
    In any event, the forms of the verb are consistent in (526). The FeSg forms
have FeSg Participial suffix -aet, but no Participial suffix occurs on the verb in
the MaSg or PI constructions. One variant of the FeSg construction (526.b.ii)
also adds -aet to the Neg particle (waer-ast). The MaSg and PI add their
participial suffixes to the Neg particle (waer-aen).

7.2.3.1    Short Imperfective stem (Shlmpf)In positive main clauses with no preverb, other forms (Resit, LoImpfP) are
used as translation equivalents of the English present tenses (simple present,
present progressive). The Shlmpf is used after a Future preverbal particle (e.g.
ad), with or without negation. It is used in an add-on construction in parallel
with a preceding imperfective clause (§13.4). It is used in subordinated
clauses beginning with minimal demonstrative a, for example purposive
clauses (§13.2.1). It is optionally used in the consequent clause of
312     7 Verbal morphologycounterfactual and proverbial conditionals (§13.9.2-3). It is used with the verb
- ν η η υ - 'say' in the fixed expression t - a n n a - d 'you-Sg (would) say',
translatable more idiomatically as 'it is/was as though ...', with a following NP
or clause.
      A Neg preverb with the Future, or in an add-on clause, is compatible with
a Shlmpf verb. Thus ad 1-druram 'it (liquid) will run' is negated as u - m a r
1-druram 'it won't run'.
      Examples of the Shlmpf stem are in (314), with PerfP forms for
comparison.","[330, 331]"

            -νΐΐυ-                'exist' (usually Resit -slid-)
            -vbu-                 'lose'    -vkku- 'go to' is the 'go' verb used with a specified destination, which is
expressed as the direct object. A PerfP example with object NP is t-akka
e-haen 'she went to the house'. Note that the object NP has no locative
preposition. The destination can also be expressed as an object clitic:
Skkas-nAt 'they-Ma went to him'. The verb can be passivized: 0-aetw-aekka
'he was gone to'. A reciprocal version: aenm-äekkas-n 'they went to each
other'. A different verb -vjlu- expresses intransitive 'go, go away, depart' with
no specified destination.
    Likewise, -vfvl- 'go from, leave' takes an object NP denoting the
departure point. Example: i-faelAad baemasko 'he left Bamako (on the way
576     9 Verb phrases and other predicationshere)'. -\ad(d) here is the Centripetal clitic. This transitive verb, along with the
use of preposition r o r 'chez, at the place of in composite 'from X to Y'
adverbial expressions (§6.7), makes an ablative preposition unnecessary, and
Tamashek has none.
     -vwvr- 'be on' takes a direct object, rather than a PP, to specify the object
or surface on which the subject rests. In the (positive) stative sense it occurs in
the Resit form -awdr-. An example with full noun as object: i-war t-s-hun-t
'he is on the stone'. An example with object clitic is i-wdr-\t 'he is on it-Ma'.
The passive sounded dubious to informants, but I was able to elicit a reciprocal
-nvm-vwvr-, 3MaPl PerfP: aenm-aewaer-aen 'they were on each other'.
     -vhi> 'be in' takes an object NP denoting the object, region, or space in
which the subject is located. Example: n-aha e-haen 'we are in the house'. The
verb can also be used in extended senses of the type 'be produced (caused) by'.
Example: i-h-\e a-s-assuhu η Vrazzej 'strengthening of the livestock is in
(=is brought about by) it (=a pasture grass sp.)'. In positive main clauses it is
always in the Resit form, -vhu- is a defective verb with no imperfective stems
(§7.3.2.12). It occurs in many idiomatic phrases, for example with a nominal
denoting a personality trait or other characteristic as subject, and a human NP
as object, e.g. t-ah-\e ""t-ae-haeke 'he is generous' (lit. ""giving is in him"").
     Another defective transitive verb is -νΐυ- 'have', the ordinary verb of
possession. It too appears (in positive sentences) in the Resit form -aid-. See
§7.3.2.14. One can extract the object to give sentences like e-haen miAtH-las-n
'the house [topic], who has it?' (i.e. 'to whom does the house belong?'). For an
alternative construction 'X be mine' etc. see §9.4.
     Still another defective transitive verb is -νΐΐυ-, which combines with a
referentially empty 3MaSg object clitic to form an existential sense 'exist,
there is/are'. See §9.3, below, and §7.3.2.11 for the irregular morphology and
the dialectally variable omission or reinterpretation of the 3MaSg clitic.
     The sense 'get lost' is expressed as (PerfP) 0-aeba-, with invariant 3MaSg
subject form (here 0 - before a) plus an object NP or clitic denoting the person
or object lost. Example: 0-aeba-\taet 'she got lost', also a common polite
expression for 'she died'. The 3MaSg subject is audible as i- in LoImpfP
i-t-iba-\taen 'they are (often) lost'. See §7.3.2.16 for more forms of this
defective verb.","[594, 595]"
"    The negative imperative (=prohibitive) category is expressed using either
the P e r f N or a the Prohib stem of the long imperfective group after N e g

(short) hortative positive. The suffix is C)-et, extended as C)-het after a full
vowel. It is the only suffix beginning with a full V. Insertion of h is also
typical of clitics that begin with a short or full V. When word-final, the
Hortative suffix requires accent (marked as v) on the word penult. For
Hortative ( ~)-et with long imperfective stems, see §7.2.5.5. For an alternative
hortative construction based on the Imprt stem, and not involving the Hortative
suffix, see §7.2.4, below.

13.3     Jussive and subjunctive clauses (a-\d)This section turns to a-\d clauses that are subordinated to a controlling verb.
     Positive jussives (quoted imperatives) are expressed with a main clause
containing -νηηυ- 'say', with or without an explicit dative, and a subordinated
clause beginning in phonetic [ad] with a S h l m p f verb, or a LoImpfP verb
denoting recurrent events. The d of [od] is dropped if a clitic is present. The
[ad] can, at first sight, be taken either as Future particle ad, or as the sequence
of minimal demonstrative ά and cliticized Comitative -\d, i.e. a-\d. The latter
analysis is shown to be correct for T-ka and most other dialects by the form of
negative subordinated clauses (a-\d waer ..., etc., see below).(815)   a.      snne-Y-\a-s                   [a-\d          i-nzsr]

There are two exceptions. First, imperatives have an unaffixed 2Sg, and
special suffixed 2MaPl and 2FePl forms (§7.4.3). Second, certain verbs with
""adjectival"" sense have a special type of perfective stem (of probable nominal
origin) that can take subject suffixes but not subject prefixes (§7.4.2).
    The morphological relationships among the stem types in (302) vary
depending on the type of verb, which is primarily determined by the basic
syllable shape of the stem, distinguishing short from full V ' s and in some
positions distinguishing geminate consonant clusters, represented as ""PP,"" and
nongeminate clusters, represented as ""PQ."" Where indexation is not needed I
use ""C"" for consonants, hence ""CC"" for clusters that may be geminate or non-
geminate. In abstract representations of stems, ""v"" is a short vowel, ""υ"" is a
full vowel, and ""V"" can be either short or full. It is not necessary to mark
accents in these abstract lexical representations, since inflectable verb stems
294     7 Verbal morphologyacquire accent either by accent formative χ-pcl in ablaut (Resit, LoImpfP), or
by Default Accentuation (§3.3.1). Aside from differences among stem-shape
classes, e.g. -vPPvC-, -uPQu-, and -CvCvC-, there are also special features
associated with adjectival verbs.
    This chapter is organized as follows. First, Augment -t of a large class of
V-final stems is discussed (§7.1). These are referred to throughout as augment
verbs, in contrast to unaugmented V-final stems. Then the stem categories in
(302) are discussed in turn, briefly describing the syntax and semantics of each
category, and extracting generalizations about ablaut morphology that apply
across stem-shape classes (§7.2). In §7.3.1 I focus in turn on each stem-shape
class, beginning with various types of (syllabically) light verbs and moving on
to heavy and superheavy stems (on the ligh/heavy distinction see §3.4.1.4). In
§7.3.2 I proceed to discuss verbs that have individual idiosyncrasies. There is
considerable duplication between §7.2 and §7.3, since they approach the same
morphological system from two different perspectives. In §7.4 I describe the
pronominal subject prefixes and suffixes.","[312, 313]"
"
7.2.5.1     Long Imperfective Positive stem (LoImpfP)The LoImpfP is the only stem in the imperfective system, aside from the
uncommon long imperative, that can be used clause-initially (i.e. without
preverbal particles): i-jdll 'he goes (regularly)'. It can denote recurring or
habitual events, or a (present) progressive, as in i-t-ihnaffi-t 'he often moans'
or 'he is moaning' and i-t-umad (variant i-t-imud) 'he prays (regularly)' or 'he
is praying'. I noted above that the Resit, which is part of the perfective system,
may also be used in present stative/resultative sense and for some verbs can be
glossed with the English progressive: i-ttas 'he is sleeping' (better: 'he went to
sleep and is still asleep'; root Vds). The LoImpfP may be preceded by Future
ad to denote future recurrent events: ad i-jdll 'he will go (regularly)'; this
combination is uncommon, the usual future being a d plus the Shlmpf. The
LoImpfP is replaced by the LoImpfN when directly preceded by Negative
waer.
    The LoImpfP is built from the basic lexical form of the stem by the full set
of ablaut features listed in (328), above. The melody, which is diagnostic of
the characteristic long imperfective melody (also used in the Prohib), depends
on the stem-shape type. Except for the type -(t-)awwdt- 'hits' with
compositive <H L> melody, all T-ka verbs have either stem-wide <L> or
                                                             7.2 Stern categories     331stem-wide <H> as the characteristic long imperfective melody, but eastern
dialects preserve some cases of <L H> with V-final non-augment verbs.
    All LoImpfP stems have one of the two consonantal increments, Γ-c2 or T,
and for some speakers (or dialects) the type -(t-)aww0t 'hits' has both.","[349, 350]"

3.5.2     Verbs after particles3.5.2.1     Verbs after Future particlesThe (non-imperative) Shlmpf (=short imperfective, §7.2.3.1) stem is always a
""dependent"" form. It is used chiefly after Future particle ad (or variant,
§9.6.3), whether or not a Negative particle is also present. An example is ad
0-aeks 'he will eat'.
     The Shlmpf is usually just the ""basic"" (i.e. minimal) form of the verb stem
(e.g. -vCCvC-) plus a melody (<L>, <H>, or <L H>). The Shlmpf lacks the
special ablaut components of the long imperfective (accent and lengthening of
V's, gemination of C's, addition of prefixal -t-).
     Since the Shlmpf is not obviously connected to any other specific stem, no
(morpho-)phonological derivation will be offered here to ""derive"" the Shlmpf
                      3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes       151stem. The use of a stripped-down, minimal verb form after the Future particle
is roughly similar to the use of phonologically reduced noun and verb forms in
Y position in [X Y...] syntactic combinations. However, the combination of
Future particle plus Shlmpf does not fit the prototypical [X Y...] pattern, which
requires adjacency of X and Y. By contrast, the Shlmpf stem need not be
adjacent to the Future particle. This is because a combination [Future +
Shlmpf clause] may be followed by a second Shlmpf clause without repeating
the Future particle (§13.4).","[169, 170]"

constructions. There are two, both containing Negative preverb waer. Both
constructions are widely distributed in Tamashek dialects.
      In what I call the PerfN prohibitive, waer is followed by a PerfN stem
with the usual (non-imperative) 2Sg, 2MaPl, or 2FePl subject affixes (2Sg
t-...-aed, 2MaPl t-.-.-asm, 2FePl t-...-maet, with the t- prefix generally deleted
before a C). The entire construction is identical to the (2nd person) perfective
negative construction. Examples in (342).(342)    a.       waer     t-alle^-asd
                  Neg      2S-insert.PerfN-2SgS

                  'Don't-FePl sleep (late)!' (K)    The alternative is an unambiguously prohibitive form that I call the
Lolmpf prohibitive. This construction consists of Negative waer plus a form
of the Prohib stem with imperative-type subject marking (§7.4.3): zero for
2Sg, O-aet for 2MaPl, and O-maet for 2FePl (both 2MaPl and 2FePl suffixes
require word-penultimate accent). Examples are in (343). The t- prefix in some
of the verbs is that of the long imperfective system, not the 2nd person (non-
imperative) subject prefix.(343)    a.      waer     t-aellaez

with Comit -\d, as usual in spatiotemporals.(787)   a.       aelwasqq [w-a-\d                i-mmu-t],

is omitted in the presence of another clitic) is also used in temporal contexts
'when ...'; see §13.1.2, below for examples. One can expand this by adding a
head noun ajud (cf. noun s-jud 'point in time') (788). ajud usually means 'if
...' (§13.9), but 'if...' and adverbial 'when ...' overlap pragmatically.(788)   a.      ajud        d-i-h<S-\d...

person clitic. In (685.a), the final -\tt is a 3Sg object form, so the ambiguous
lSg Λα-hi- is interpreted as a dative. In (685.b), the final -\ha-s is a 3Sg
dative, so the ambiguous lSg Λα-hi- is interpreted as an object pronominal. In
both types, informants normally reject suggested alternatives with the lSg
clitic following the non-lst person clitic. Thus #i-waet-\t-\ha-hi for (685.a) and
#i-wast-\a-s-\ha-hi for (685.b) were usually expressly rejected, though very
rarely such a combination did occur in paradigmatic elicitation.
     However, in some combinations it is possible for a 1st person dative clitic
to follow a 3rd person object clitic. Consider (686), attested in T-md and K-d.
                                                  10.4 Ordering of clitics   613(686)   i-qre-\n-\ha-hi
        3MaSgS-kill.PerfP-\3MaP10-\Dat-lSg
        'He killed them-Ma for me.' (T-md)     Here the 3MaPl object has a reduced, arguably V-initial allomorph (/-aen-/)
after the V-final verb (-sgra-), and we get VV-Contraction with /a-ae/
surfacing as e. It appears that this ""fusion"" of object clitic with stem-final V
permits an exception to the first person first rule. However, even here, some
speakers including my primary T-ka informant strongly prefer to allow the first
person first rule to apply, so instead of (686) they have i-qYCi-\0-hi-\taen, with
3MaP10 -\taen at the end.
     In the combinations not involving a 1st person clitic, the common
sequence is dative-object. In other words, the object-2 slot is favored for
object clitics. One can account for the data by recognizing (684.b) as the basic
order, while allowing for subsequent ""fronting"" of a lSg or 1P1 form to initial
position within the clitic cluster. However, there are also some attestations of
object-dative order even when a 1st person clitic is not involved, so the
ordering is not rigid.
     In the uncommon case where two objects and one dative co-occur, the two
object clitics flank the dative clitic, so we get object-dative-object order.
     Some further examples each involving one dative clitic and one object
clitic are in (687). The verb glossed 'kill' can also mean 'hit hard, whack'.
(687.a-b) include a 1st person, while the others do not.(687)   a.      waer-\hl-\tt                   i-ηγα

  Discourse-functional particles and topicalization
11.1    TopicalizationA topicalized constituent can be placed before the clause proper. It has its own
accentuation in this position, may have ""comma"" intonation, and is essentially
external to the clause. If the referent in question is subject, object, etc., it is
expressed by a pronominal in the clause proper. In (689.a-b), the topicalized
nouns (masculine and feminine, respectively), correspond to the object clitics
within the clause proper.(689)    a.      e-haen    [ajbar-aen-\t                       am-an]

7.3.2.13        'have' (V/JThe possessive verb is -νΐυ-. Like -vhu- 'be in' (see just above), it is used only
in the perfective system, and it is most often reduced to -1υ-. It is a simple
transitive as in English. Like 'be' and 'be in' (§7.3.2.11-12, above), it occurs
only in perfective forms. In positive main clauses it occurs in the Resit, and
negative counterparts have the PerfN. The PerfP is found in subordinated
clauses. As with 'be' and 'be in', unmarked time reference is present or
timeless, while past time may be specified by preposing kaela.","[443, 444]"
"    It is important to distinguish a-\d (Focus morpheme a plus cliticized
Comitative d) from clause-initial Future particle ad. This can be tricky,
except in negatives, since Future ad reduces to a - before a clitic. In
otherwords, both a-\d (Focus and cliticized Comit) and ad (Future) appear as
[ad] without a further clitic, and as [a] in the presence of a further clitic. If the
following verb phrase contains a preverbal particle, or an inflected verb in a
stem other than Shlmpf or LoImpfP, the initial element must be interpreted as
a-\d rather than as Future ad. If the following verb phrase lacks preverbal
particles and has a Shlmpf or LoImpfP verb, the initial element is ambiguous
and must be interpreted in context.",[666]

X precedes the negative form as a kind of topicalized NP.(635)     a.       a-w-a                        waedder       edi

"     Both -vmus- and -vqqvl- in copula function can take object pronominals

elicitable.(622)   a.      aemos-aeq-\q

normally takes a referentially empty 3MaSg object clitic (allomorphs -\tt, At,

when the words are phrase-initial or occur in isolation, since default and
marked accents are identical phonetically, but the difference can be inferred
from the broader (morpho-)phonology including the negative counterparts
presented below.
    The Sg Participial suffixes, MaSg -aen and FeSg -ast, show accentuation
parallel to that seen in (65.c). Thus 0-osas-n 'come-Partpl.MaSg', as in ere-\d
0-osae-n 'whoever comes'. Note that the accent remains on the 0-osae-n rather
than shifting to the preceding ere.
    The negative (PerfN) counterparts to (65), shown in (66) below, bring out
the accentual distinctions between lSg/2Sg and 3MaPl/2MaPl that are latent in
the PerfP (66). This is because PerfN verbs are always preceded by Neg waer,
which takes phrasal accent when followed by an unaccented bisyllabic stem as
in (66.b), but not when the verb is treated (at the point where Default
Accentuation applies) as trisyllabic as in (66.c). The e in (66.c) is ablauted
from /ae/, as usual in PerfN verbs, rather than being due to VV-Contraction.

               2MaPl              waer t-ojje-m    This paradigm has been verified for several dialects (T-ka, K-d, R). In
effect, then, the stem-final V of the Perf stems is deleted outright before the
3MaPl and 2MaPl suffixes (66.c). However, the penultimate accent, audible in
(66.c) and latently present in (65.c), suggests that this V is present when the
accentuation rule applies, so VV-Contraction follows Default Accentuation.
On the other hand, the stem-final V contracts with the initial short V of the lSg
and 2Sg suffixes (66.b), but this VV-Contraction p r e c e d e s Default
Accentuation.
     In trisyllabic unaugmented V-final stems, the paradigms are simpler. The
PerfN ablaut element e is not applicable to these superheavy stems (it is
audibly present only in bisyllables). Moreover, the lSg and 2Sg suffixes are
treated just like the 3MaPl and 2MaPl suffixes, so the stem-final V is deleted
outright but leaves a trace behind in the form of surface penultimate accent.

identical (but are preceded by waer).","[109, 110]"
"     Another common 'maybe' construction involves t-arhd, which if so
transcribed (t-aerha would also be phonetically accurate) could be taken as a
specialized 3FeSg subject Resit of 'want', plus a clause with aAd. In (856.a) I
give a negative complement to show that we have aAd rather than Future ad
(which becomes ü-mar in this dialect in the negative, as in (855) above.

is that illustrated in (856.b). The key phrase is i-ll-\e, which usually means 'it

3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processesThere is a pervasive interaction between ""syntax"" and ""phonology"" in
Tamashek, which allows us to make a strong case for a morphological view of
the grammar. That is, instead of a model of grammar that starts with an
autonomous abstract syntax, and then allows a phonological module to execute
more or less natural phonological adjustments to the outputs of the syntax,
Tamashek lends itself to a model where grammatical categories, linear
ordering, and phonology (segmental, accentual, and ablaut) are inextricably
intertwined.
    The common denominator of the phenomena treated in this section is a
repeating ""figure"" of the type [X+Y...], where X is some phrase-initial word or
particle, and Y is a word whose phonological form is modified in this syntactic
context. The modifications of Y are mostly, but not always, interpretable as
reductions. The [X+Y...] groupings do not correspond to phrasal boundaries in
current formal syntactic models. For example, the combination [verb
+ subject] (excluding object) is not recognized as a phrase in any syntactic
theory I know of. Therefore even the phrasal bracketings relevant to the
morphophonological processes described here are idiosyncratic to Tamashek.
On top of this, the phrasal bracketings are not identical to those needed for
phrasal accent. For example, [verb + object] counts as a phrase for
accentuation, as does [verb + subject], but of the two only [verb + subject}
shows Prefix Reduction in the noun. Therefore converting ""syntactic"" phrases
to ""prosodic"" phrases by rebracketing, as a way of explaining how Tamashek
microsyntactic organization diverges from natural syntactic groups, will not
                     3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes       147work, at least if ""prosodic"" phrases are defined in a manner relevant to actual
prosody.","[165, 166]"

9.6.3   Future (ad, ar, mar, mad, e)The Future particle has a form dd in clause-initial position. It is followed
(after any clitics that may be present) by a Shlmpf or (rarely) LoImpfP verb
stem. I was told by informants that there is a dialectal variant ar, but I cannot
identify the dialect(s) in question, and ad is usual in all the dialects I worked
on.
    The d of ad is dropped before any clitic, as in αΑΚί i-wat 'he will hit me'
(lSgO clitic Ahi). Perhaps a trace of the *d lingers in the geminated tt of the
3MaSgO clitic Att (postvocalic allomorph), as in aAtt awat-aer Ί will hit
him', but the geminated tt is now part of the clitic and is also heard after
V-final verb stems (§10.3.1).
    The alternation of ad and ά in the Future particle results in partial
convergence between this particle and the combination aAd consisting of a
590     9 Verb phrases and other predicationsminimal demonstrative ά and a following cliticized Comitative preposition d
(= ad). This a-\d functions as the normal jussive complementizer (§13.3). The
surface convergence of complementizer a - \ d with Fut d d is especially
thoroughgoing in that the -\d in a-\d is omitted if another clitic is present, as in
certain high-frequency adverbial clause types. Therefore both Fut ad and
complementizer a-\d appear as phonetic [ad] without a clitic and as phonetic
[a] before a clitic. Moreover, both occur clause-initially.
     However, there is a syntactic distinction between Future ad and the
combination a-\d in the way they combine with negation. The combination
Neg + Fut is expressed as Neg wzer (or a reduced allomorph) plus a distinctive
non-clause-initial Future allomorph such as m a d or e replacing ad (§9.6.4,
below). By contrast, complementizer a-\d is followed by Neg waer. In
addition, Future ad can only be followed by a Shlmpf or (much less often)
LoImpfP stem, whereas complementizer a-\d can be followed by a fuller range
of stems (including perfectives).
    In ordinary contexts, the verb stem used after Future ad is the Shlmpf, as
in (641.a). The LoImpfP is much less common, but can be used to specify an
extended time span (641.b).(641)   a.      ad        i-jal

5.1.1.2          ComparativesThe most common symmetrical comparative construction, glossable as 'X be
as [adjective] as Y \ involves the transitive verb -ujdvh- (PerfP -ojdaeh-). In
the absence of a specification, this verb can mean 'be equal to' or 'be as big
as'. It can be adapted to other adjectival qualities by adding an appropriate
specification ('X equals Y [with respect to\ strength'). The specifying noun
follows the verb, with no preposition. The Resit stem -ojdaeh- is usual in
positive comparatives. Some dialects have g for T-ka j.(220)     a.        waerAdsr-l                  0-ogdeh

attainment of equality with something. Its most common use is in questions
and in negative statements like (221), which provide a mechanism for
translating 'less than'.(221)     wser 0-aewwed                     abbä-nnet         [daer t-sssajrat-t]

simple NP object (Y) in the sense 'X be bigger than Y' or 'X be more than Y'.
In positive comparatives it is usually in Resit form. Additional asymmetrical
comparatives can be generated by adding an additional non-argument NP
