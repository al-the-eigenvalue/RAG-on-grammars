"                             8 Chafe    (1976)   doesn't     actually        use        the     term   ‘single      focus
                     contrast',        but others    have applied         this     term to situations         where      the
                     three     conditions   he   outlines    hold    true        (e.g   Dooley    1982).                           9 the term 'double focus contrast'    is   sometimes     used    in   the
                     literature.     Asserting a correct  match-up   betwen  two   paris  of   items
                     is clearly far more common, though    Chafe    suggests    that    situations
                    with triple contrast might be possible.

                     which an affirmative is expressed by the negative of the contrary.",[391]

                     1.    Basic constituent order is VSO (order of direct object and
                           oblique may vary).
                     2.    Fronting of NP's (or other elements) to the left of the verb
                           is a possibility under pragmatically marked conditions.
                     3.    There is a tendency to move given information to end of the
                           clause (relative to the order of direct object and oblique).
                     4.    The language is agglutinative and polysynthetic.
                     5.    There is essentially no nominal case marking for subject and
                           object (but Set II clitics have case/pronominal features).
                     6.    Relative clauses are post-head.
                     7.    Descriptive modifiers are post-head.
                     8.    Relativization may be by deletion                     or by retention         of a
                           Set I or Set II clitic in the position relativized.
                     9.    Manner adverbs generally follow the verb.
                     10.   Auxiliaries precede the verb.
                     11.   The dominant       negative      particle néé precedes               the verb.
                     12.   (Some) modal formatives are affixal to the verb.
                     13.   Embedded verbs generally follow the embedding verb.
                     14.   Clausal objects follow the main verb.
                     15.   There is no overt copula.
                     16.   Placement of the yes/no question particle is specified with  _
                           reference to the beginning of clause (second position within C).
                     17.   In information questions, the questioned NP is fronted
                            ('movement' of questioned NPs from embedded clauses is also
                           a possibility at least for subjects).
                     18.   Some adverbial and complement clause types follow their main
                           clause (though conditionals and other -tiy clauses precede
                           their main clause).
                     19.   Complementizers precede their clause.","[406, 407]"

                     marked intonation are from oral texts.    A double slash line represents
                     a      relatively  longer   pause    than   ae   single    slash,    judged

It    is       important        to keep          in mind         that    in                     all      languages                  there           is     probably            some         sensitivity           to      pragmatic                     factors.           In some           languages,              such    as       Papago,        pragmatic          factors        account                     for     just       about          all     ordering            phenomena,              and      consequently               there         is                     questionable                  value          in trying         to    force          them     into    a syntactic           ordering                     mold.     It is not                 clear       to me that we even want                        to talk           about          ‘basic’                     ordering            in        such           languages.             We    would         first       have    to    show     that        new                     information              is       more        (or    less)      basic           than        given       information;               that                     definite                information                  is     more         (or        less)      basic        than         indefinite                     information,                 etc.       And     it       is not clear           to me that we can do                      so.      Both                     new      and        given            information               are       clearly        essential          to    communication,                     though        it    may       be true           that         given        is        more      frequent,           at      least         in                     narrative           genres.","[50, 51]"

Given    any                     particular             sentence            or        noun    phrase         in        isolation,                   it         is        relatively                     difficult                to      determine                  whether             a    noun          refers               to          a     discourse                     manipulable              entity        or        concept.           For    example,               in     (251)          above,            we cannot                     really       tell       whether             niisijyo          is     discourse              manipulable.

The        following              clause        occurs           later        in the text                  than     the                     clause        in which           tapyyvyey                 niisijyo         is       introduced.",[163]

                     some  other  way   pragmatically               marked,         I    have     counted    it   just    as
                     pragmatically marked.                           16 me data in Table 6.6 may suggest that     A   is more  commonly
                     encoded    with  a noun phrase when pragmatically marked and preverbal.
                     However, when the data of Tables 6.5 and 6.6 is taken together, overt
                     cases   of   preverbal  A and   postverbal  A   are more eqval.  This is
                     reflected in Table 6.12.",[391]
