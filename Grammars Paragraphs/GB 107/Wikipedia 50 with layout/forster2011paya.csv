  This construction is the negation of the adjective and does not carry the antithetic connotation of the suffixed word (see
9.4.2.3).
206                                                                                                                    Commands1) Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) „no‟ negating a word
      As discussed in Section 9.4.2, the negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) may be used to negate specific
      words such as adjectives or adverbs. The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) is added to an
      adjective to give a negative answer to a question, to intensify antithesis or to provide an antonym for an
      adjective which does not have an antonym.
Examples
    1. totojuli                      ‗not small (emphatic: large)‘
    2. kakpijuli                     ‗not at all bitter (sweet)‘
    3. tikalbal                      ‗nearby‘
       becomes
       tikajul                       ‗not near (far)‘2) Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) „no‟ negating a sentence
      A Kuna sentence is negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) ‗no‘ to the verb.96
      The long form has a more emphatic connotation than the short. The suffix is attached to the verb stem or
      immediately following the aspect suffix, for example, the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi (see 2.4.2.1).
Examples
    1. An immal pakchul.                                       ‗I did not buy a thing.‘
    2. An mol peichuli.97                                      ‗I do not want cloth.‘
    3. An mol peichul.                                         ‗I do not want cloth.‘
    4. An nan takchajul.                                       ‗I did not see Mother.‘
    5. Anmal yannu gwen takchajulmal.                          ‗We did not see a single peccary.‘
    6. An nebijul.                                             ‗I don’t want to go.‘
Exercise 23. -chul/-zhul/-jul negation of sentence frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise is repeated several times.
Example        Teacher: An nejul.
               Student: An nejul.
       1. An nejul.                                  ‗I am not going to go.‘
       2. An mas kuchajul.                           ‗I didn‘t eat (any) food.‘
       3. An mol pakchajul.                          ‗I didn‘t buy cloth.‘
       4. An tub peichul.                            ‗I don‘t want thread.‘
       5. An nebijul.                                ‗I don‘t want to go.‘
Exercise 24. -chul/-zhul/-jul negation of sentence stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a sentence from those listed below. The student responds by giving the negative form of the
sentence.
Example        Teacher: An ne.
               Student: An nejul.
       1. An ne.                                     ‗I‘m going to go.‘
       2. Machi ua chwas.                            ‗The boy caught a fish.‘
       3. Tad es pakpi.                              ‗The elder wants to buy a machete.‘
96
   After the dipthongs ai, ei, and oi, -chul(i) occurs rather than -jul(i). In fact, the -ch form of any suffix having an alternate
beginning in ch would occur after these diphthongs.
97
   The verb stem pei ‗to want to have (something)‘ expresses a desiderative state (see 2.4.2.2).
15.4 Grammar                                                                                                      207      4. An mani pei.                       ‗I want money.‘
      5. An karpa chobcha.                  ‗I made a basket.‘
Note that s + ch/j = ch, for example, chwas + -jul = chwachul.","[218, 219, 220]"
"1) Forms of the basic negative word chuli „no‟
        When used alone, the basic negative word chuli ‗no‘ may occur in one of three forms:a) Chul ‗no‘
     Chul ‗no‘ is the most common form of the basic negative word. It is used in response to a question which
     requires a negative answer. In other words, it is used to deny that the action in the question is going to take
     place.
94
     -chul follows fortis consonants, -zhul follows lenis consonants, and -jul follows vowels.
15.4 Grammar                                                                                                               205Examples
    1. ¿Pe ne?                     ‗Are you going?‘
    2. Chul.                       ‗No.‘b) Chuli ‗no‘
     Chuli ‗no‘ is a more emphatic form of the basic negative word and is used as a more emphatic denial in
     response to the same situations for which you would reply with chul ‗no‘.
Examples
    1. ¿Pedro Pucurche ne?                         ‗Is Peter going to Pucuro?‘
    2. ¡Chuli!                                     ‗No!‘c) Chula ‗no‘
     Chula ‗no‘ is a very rare form of the basic negative word. It is used in reference to an action of the past
     and parallels the English construction, ―never, not a chance.‖ It is often used as a response to consistent
     teasing or persistent accusation and gives the response the flavor of ―not only is that not true, it never was
     true either!‖
Examples
    1. ¡An akande, pedin tar chus!                 ‗You took my axe!‘
    2. ¡Chula!                                     ‗No (I did nothing of the kind)!‘2) Basic negative word used in a sentence
      Any form of the basic negative word chul/chuli/chula ‗no‘ may be used in a sentence to deny that an
      adverb or adjective used in the/a previous sentence is valid. In this construction, the sentence is reiterated.
      The subject must be emphasized by the addition of the topic marking suffix -din/-tin or by the use of the
      demonstrative adjective we ‗that‘. A form of the word chul/chuli/chula is used at the end of the sentence
      to negate the adjective/adverb.
Examples
    1. Uade, totó.                                 ‗The fish is small.‘
    2. Uadin, toto chul.95                         ‗The fish is not small.‘
       or
       We ua, toto chul.                           ‗That fish is not small.‘
Exercise 22. Chul ‗no‘ denial stimulus-response drill
The teacher selects a sentence and says it. The student replies denying the statement.
Examples       Teacher: Uade, totó.
               Student: Uadin, toto chul.
       1. Uade, totó.         ‗That fish is small.‘
       2. Molde, muis.        ‗That cloth is cheap.‘
       3. Manide, unni.       ‗That money is enough.‘
       4. Akande, nued.       ‗That axe is good.‘
       5. Ulde, tummad.       ‗That canoe is big.‘15.4.2.2 Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i)
The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhuli/-jul(i) may be added to certain words in order to negate the word itself
or it may be used to negate an entire sentence.","[217, 218]"
"1) Negation of adjectives ending in a consonant
      Adjectives that end in a consonant are negated by use of the negative forms -chuli/-zhuli following the
      adjective.
Examples
   1a. chered                   ‗old‘
    b. cheredzhuli              ‗not old‘
   2a. nued                     ‗good‘
    b. nuedzhuli                ‗not good‘2) Negation of adjectives ending in a vowel
      Adjectives that end in a vowel are negated by the addition of -juli to the adjective.
Examples
   1a. kollo                    ‗ripe‘
    b. kollojuli                ‗not ripe‘
   2a. toto                     ‗small‘
    b. totojuli                 ‗not small‘3) Exception in negated adjective formation
      Two common exceptions in the formation of negated adjectives ending in a consonant involve the words
      tummad ‗big‘ and muis ‗cheap‘. In the case of the former, the consonant is dropped and the negative
      suffix -juli is added to the adjective. In the case of the latter, s + ch becomes d.
Examples
   1a. tummad/tummadi           ‗big‘
    b. tummajuli                ‗not big‘
9.4 Grammar                                                                                                    107     2a. muis                   ‗inexpensive‘
      b. muiduli                ‗not inexpensive‘9.4.2.2 Common significance of negated adjectives
The most common meaning of a negated adjective is similar to the meaning of the negated adjective in
English/Spanish.
Examples
   1a. istar                    ‗bad‘
    b. istarchuli               ‗not bad‘
   2a. olobi                    ‗empty‘
    b. olobijuli                ‗not empty‘
When it has this meaning, the first syllable of the negative suffix tends to be stressed.
Example        olobijúli                       ‗not empty‘9.4.2.3 Idiomatic use of negated adjectives
Sometimes the use of a negated adjective does more than simply negate an attribute. When a person chooses to
use the negated form of certain adjectives in preference to an existing antonym, a very intense antithesis is
communicated. In this case, the use of the negated adjective completely eliminates any characteristic of the
concept negated.
Examples
       1. iche                    ‗a little‘
       2. ichejuli                ‗not a little (a lot)‘
In this construction, the syllable preceding the negative suffix tends to be stressed.
Example        ichéjuli                          ‗not a little (a lot)‘
The intensification of antithesis is a phenomenon which occurs only with certain adjectives. Some adjectives
that are used to intensify antithesis are in the following list.
Examples
                       Direct Translation      Idiomatic Significance
      1. totojuli      ‗not small‘             ‗big‘
      2. purwijuli     ‗not tiny‘              ‗large‘
      3. tutujuli      ‗not soft‘              ‗hard‘
      4. tinnajuli     ‗not dry‘               ‗damp/wet‘
      5. karkijuli     ‗not expensive‘         ‗inexpensive‘
      6. muiduli       ‗not cheap‘             ‗expensive‘
      7. ichejuli      ‗not a little‘          ‗a lot‘
      8. tikajuli      ‗not nearby‘            ‗far away‘
Exercise 6. Negated adjective drill
The teacher says Sentence 1. The student responds by repeating the modified noun with the negated form of the
adjective and omitting the verb used in Sentence 1. The succeeding sentences are drilled in a similar fashion.
Examples      Teacher: Ul toto nai.
              Student: Ul totojuli.
              Teacher: Win purwi pukwa.
              Student: Win purwijuli.
      1. Ul toto nai.                   ‗A small boat is (there).‘
      2. Win purwi pukwa.               ‗Tiny beads are (sitting) (there).‘
108                                                                                     Basic Health/Medical Discussion      3. Neg tika chi.                           ‗The house is (sitting) nearby.‘
      4. Mol karki pakcha.                       ‗I bought expensive cloth.‘
      5. Ochi tutu kunnai.                       ‗I am eating a soft candy.‘
      6. Sabured tinna nai.                      ‗The sabured is (suspended) dry.‘9.4.3 Colors (Ex. 7–10)
Color plays a very important role in Kuna culture and the Kuna concept of color varies considerably from the
English/Spanish view. Therefore, a brief overview of the Kuna color system is given here for the language
learner.37
Truly beautiful colors from a Kuna standpoint are colors which are classified as ―pure‖ colors. Each of the five
―pure‖ colors has a name:
      1. kinnid                  ‗red‘
      2. kollogwad               ‗yellow‘
      3. arrad                   ‗blue‘
      4. chibu                   ‗white‘
      5. chichid                 ‗black‘
All other colors are inferior and less highly valued. The five pure colors comprise the base points of a two-way
color distinction; spectral colors and shades of intensity.","[119, 120, 121]"
"15.4 Grammar
15.4.1 Commands: Direct/Polite (Ex. 3–21)
As it has already been expressed, commands or requests vary in force. The relative force of the command is not
only conveyed by intonation, as seen in Section B, but is also expressed by the grammatical structure chosen.
There are three degrees of forcefulness in Kuna commands: 1) polite command, 2) strong command, and 3)
very polite command.
The three degrees of commands may be expressed in singular form or group form and each may be positive or
negative.",[207]
"1) Negative command words
     There are several words in Kuna which may be used in isolation and which are strong negative commands.
     These negative command words are used in the same situations as their English/Spanish counterparts.
Examples
    1. ¡Melle!                  ‗Don‘t!‘
    2. ¡Mellema!                ‗Don‘t, I said!‘
    3. ¡Kusma!                  ‗Stop it!‘
    4. ¡Ogus!                   ‗That‘s enough!‘2) Negative commands
     Any command may be made negative by placing the word melle ‗don‘t‘ before the command.
204                                                                                                     CommandsExamples
    1. ¡Melle tag!                                  ‗Don’t come!‘
    2. Melle negzhe nao.                            ‗Please don’t go home.‘
    3. Melle wis negwelo.                           ‗(Be so kind as) not to go.‘
Exercise 20. Melle negative command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example          Teacher: Melle nao.
                 Student: Melle nao.
         1. Melle nao.          ‗Don‘t go.‘
         2. Melle chogo.        ‗Don‘t tell (anyone).‘
         3. Melle kobo.         ‗Don‘t drink (it).‘
         4. ¡Melle po!          ‗Don‘t cry!‘
         5. ¡Melle ebu!         ‗Don‘t touch!‘
Exercise 21. Negative command stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a command from those listed below and says it. The student gives the negative form of the
command in reply.
Example          Teacher: Negzhe nao.
                 Student: Melle negzhe nao.
         1. Negzhe nao.         ‗Please go home.‘
         2. Ina kobo.           ‗Please take the medicine.‘
         3. Anka chogo.         ‗Please tell me.‘
         4. Machiga uko.        ‗Please give (it) to the boy.‘
         5. Mani chabo-o.       ‗Please put away the money.‘15.4.2 Negatives (Ex. 22–30)
The basic and most common negative word in Kuna is chul/chuli ‗no‘ (see 3.4.1.). This word may also be used
as a negative suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul94 attached to certain words, phrases or sentences. There are also other
negative words which are used in certain situations.","[216, 217]"
"15.4.2.1 Basic negative word chuli „no‟
The basic negative word chuli/chul ‗no‘ may be used alone as a negative exclamation, or it may be used within
a sentence. Chuli/chul ‗no‘ is used to respond negatively to a question asked, or a statement made to negate a
fact or action mentioned in the/a previous sentence, or to negate a certain adverb or adjective used in a/the
previous sentence.",[217]
"15.4.2.3 Other negative words
Several other words used in a sentence give the sentence a negative meaning.",[220]
"2) Negative desiderative action yapa „don‟t want to‟
     As has been mentioned (see 15.4.2.2.2, Example 6), a desiderative action may be negated by adding the
     basic negative suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul to the verb. The desiderative action may also be negated by use of an
     adverb yapa ‗don‘t want to‘ in the adverbial position after the subject and before the object, if there is one.
     The adverb yapa ‗don‘t want to‘ has a stronger negative connotation than does the desiderative action
     suffix -bi/-pi and -chul/-jul.
Example       An yapa mol pak.                ‗I don‘t want to buy cloth.‘
Exercise 25. Yapa negative desiderative action frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example      Teacher: An yapa ne.
             Student: An yapa ne.
      1. An yapa ne.                          ‗I don‘t want to go.‘
      2. An yapa mantur kun.                  ‗I don‘t want to eat roasted plantain.‘
      3. An yapa mol pak.                     ‗I don‘t want to buy cloth.‘
      4. An yapa ina kop.                     ‗I don‘t want to take (drink) the medicine.‘
      5. An yapa wartiku.                     ‗I don‘t want to get wet.‘
Exercise 26. Yapa negative desiderative action stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a sentence and says it. The student responds using the negative form with yapa.
Example       Teacher: An nebi.
              Student: An yapa ne.
      1. An nebi.                             ‗I want to go.‘
      2. An ua kumpi.                         ‗I want to eat fish.‘
      3. An saglabak chunmabi.                ‗I want to talk to the chief.‘
      4. An ul nudabi.                        ‗I want to repair the canoe.‘
      5. An chagla chikpi.                    ‗I want to have my hair cut.‘3) Negative adverb yo „not yet‟
     The negative adverb yo ‗not yet‘ or ‗before he/she/it (had) ...‘ is used as an adverb in a subordinate
     sentence. Yo ‗not yet‘ is when the action in the independent sentence precedes that of the subordinate
     sentence. That is to say, Kuna negates an action by using yo ‗not yet‘ to indicate the concept that before
     something happened, the action in the independent sentence took place.
Example       An yo nadgu, an mas kucha. ‗Before I left, I ate (some) food.‘

As you do the following exercises, concentrate on using correct intonation patterns. You will find that your
audience will really appreciate hearing all the details of any trip you make, no matter how brief the trip was.
Retelling the events of even a short jaunt into the jungle will provide excellent language practice. Work hard on
the intonation patterns in the following exercises so that you will be able to recount your trips in traditional
Kuna style. Your audience will be thrilled.
Exercise 1. Tracking
Track the teacher and his assistant (if available) as they say Dialogue 16.1. Concentrate on the overall
intonation patterns of the entire speech and responses.
Exercise 2. Dialogue dramatization
Dramatize Dialogue 16.1 with two students playing the roles of Traveler and Villager.
Exercise 3. Problem solving exercise
Discuss and drill any problems encountered in Exercise 2 above.
Exercise 4. Tracking
Listen to tapes of travel stories and track them, in order to thoroughly master the intonation patterns.","[220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226]"
"1) Command form when each group marker acts as an individual.
      If the speaker is addressing a command to a group of people and he expects each person to act as an
      individual, he uses a command form with no group suffix. Strong, polite and request commands may be
      used in this way.
Examples
Strong command
       1. ¡Ne!                   ‗(Each one of you) go!‘
Polite command
       2. ¡Nao!                  ‗(Each one of you) please go!‘
Request command
       3. ¡Negwelo!              ‗(Each one of you) be so kind as to go!‘2) Exclusive command form
      If the speaker is addressing a command to a group of people and he expects the group to act as a unit, but
      does not expect to do the command himself, -mal is attached to both the vocative and the verb. The
      vocative is said with the same intonation pattern and is followed by a brief pause, just as the vocative in
      statements (see 10.4.6).
Examples
    1. ¡Pemal, negzhe nemal!                   ‗(You all) go home!‘
    2. Pemal, anche tagmalo.                   ‗(You all) please come to me.‘
    3. Pemal, wis negwelmalo.                  ‗(You all) (would you be so kind as to) go.‘
    4. Pemal, wis negzhe nemalo.               ‗(You all) (would you be so kind as to) go home.‘3) Inclusive (hortatory) command form
      If the speaker is addressing a command to a group of people whom he expects to act as a unit, and he
      includes himself in the action to be done, the suffix -mal is added to the verb. The subject is not stated.
      The polite command is the preferred form for inclusive or hortatory commands, although the strong
      command form does occur.
Examples
    1. ¡Nemal!                   ‗Let‘s go!‘
    2. Nemalo.                   ‗Please, let‘s go.‘
    3. Wis negwelmalo.           ‗I would like you to be so kind as to go (with me).‘

The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example      Teacher: ¡Pemal, negzhe nemal!
             Student: ¡Pemal, negzhe nemal!
      1. ¡Pemal, negzhe nemal!          ‗You (all), go home!‘
      2. ¡Pemal, saglaga chogmal!       ‗You (all), tell the chief!‘
      3. ¡Pemal, ormanegzhe chedmal!    ‗You (all), take (them) to the meeting house!‘
      4. ¡Pemal, aknirmal!              ‗You (all), move back!‘
      5. ¡Pemal, saglaga itomal!        ‗You (all), listen to the chief!‘
Exercise 18. Inclusive strong command form
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: ¡Nemal!
              Student: ¡Nemal!
      1. ¡Nemal!                              ‗Let‘s go!‘
      2. ¡Aknirmal!                           ‗Let‘s get out of the way!‘
      3. ¡Saglaga itomal!                     ‗Let‘s listen to the chief!‘
      4. ¡Ormaked negzhe chedmal!             ‗Let‘s take (them) to the meeting house!‘
      5. ¡Neg elimal!                         ‗Let‘s clean the town!‘
Exercise 19. Inclusive polite command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: Nemalo.
              Student: Nemalo.
      1. Nemalo.            ‗Let‘s go.‘
      2. Aptamalo.          ‗Let‘s wait.‘
      3. Arbamalo.          ‗Let‘s work.‘
      4. Itomalo.           ‗Let‘s listen.‘
      5. Aknirmalo.         ‗Let‘s get out of the way.‘15.4.1.6 Negative commands
In Kuna, negative commands are given by either the use of a negative command word or by using melle ‗don‘t‘
before any command form.","[215, 216]"
"11.4.3.4 Negative conversation sustainer responses
Sometimes a conversation sustainer is a negative response.",[146]
"9.4.2.1 Formation of negated adjectives
Negated adjectives are formed by the use of the negative suffix: -chuli/-zhuli/-juli.",[119]
"1) Negative command melle „don‟t‟
     The negative command melle ‗don‘t‘ is discussed in Section 15.4.1.6.",[220]

                                             ABSTRACT
The purpose of this grammar is to help any interested person learn to speak and understand Paya Kuna ,
which is spoken by the people of Paya, Pucuru, and Capetí in the Darién province of the Republic of Panama
and in the Kuna settlements of Arquía and Kudi on the Colombian side of the border. This volume deals with
some of the most basic characteristics of Kuna pronunciation and grammar, and it provides appendices on
various topics and a fairly extensive Paya Kuna vocabulary. Many important characteristics are not discussed
in this volume, but hopefully, after mastering these first twenty lessons the student will be equipped to
continue self-directed language learning. The grammar was designed primarily for use in a classroom where
the teacher is a native speaker of Kuna, but it also lends itself to learning Kuna in the informal situation of a
Paya Kuna village. Each section is not meant to be covered in a single class period, but normally consists of a
dialogue, pronunciation notes, notes on cultural etiquette, grammar aspects and exercises, and vocabulary
items for memorization. Emphasis is put on learning by mimicking in chorus and alone until the speech
patterns become automatic, thus, using a conversational approach to learning a language. An attempt is made
throughout to not only explain and drill the forms discussed, but also to enable language students to know in
which situational contexts their use is appropriate. An effort was also made to show the inseparability of the
Kuna language from its socio-cultural context.

                            THE PAYA KUNA ALPHABET
To simplify reference, Paya Kuna will be referred to as ―Kuna.‖ For pedagogical purposes some modifications
of the official Kuna alphabet have been employed in the spelling of Kuna words in the body of the text. In the
vocabulary in Volume 3, if the official spelling differs from the practical one adopted for this grammar, it is
given in square brackets.

1.1 Dialogue
When you first encounter a Kuna speaker, it is important to establish rapport. The first step is the use of
greetings and leave-takings appropriate to the occasion. One of the common formats for greeting and
leave-taking is given in this Dialogue.
Upon arrival:
        1.    Visitor:          Anná.1                              ‗Hello.‘
        2.    Villager:         Mai./Chi.                           ‗I‘m home (masculine)./I‘m home (feminine).‘ (see
                                                                    I.D.1.)
    3. Visitor:                 An pe taktani.                      ‗I‘ve come to see you.‘

    7. Visitor:                 Nabiri.                             ‗Okay.‘

        9.    Villager:         Eye.                                ‗Yes‘1.2 Pronunciation
1.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2)
In learning another language as an adult, you will have to break one set of habits and acquire a new set as
required by the new language. One of the first is intonation, the ―tune‖ of what is being said, since Kuna
intonation differs from that of English or Spanish. Learning the intonation patterns is very important to your
future control of the language. Learn them at the beginning so you do not have to unlearn wrong patterns later.
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher (not another student) as he says Dialogue 1.1 by humming the intonation patterns (―tune‖).
Note: Humming the intonation patterns should be done before any attempt is made to master the individual
(segmental) sounds.
Attention should be paid to pitch, intensity, rhythm, etc. In short, mimic everything you can say with your
mouth still firmly shut! Further practice can be gained by mimicking the teacher under your breath, while he
is working with other students. Do not mimic other students.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 1.1. Pronounce the individual sounds as best you can without 1) slowing down
or, 2) losing the intonation pattern.
Note: If you have trouble with a particular sound, you should master the sound by using the drills designed
specifically for the sound, not by trying to master it in the dialogue.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"9.4.1.1 Position of adjective in noun phrase
In Kuna, unlike English, the adjective is placed after the noun.
Example       Karpa tummad chi.               ‗A large basket is (sitting) there.‘9.4.1.2 Position of suffixes
Up to this point, suffixes which are used in conjunction with a noun have always been attached to the noun.
Examples
      1. neggin                ‗in the house‘
      2. ulgin                 ‗in the canoe‘
      3. ¿Masde, igi mani?     ‗The plantains, how much are they?‘
However, when the noun is modified by an adjective (e.g., ‗small‘, ‗red‘), the noun plus the adjective is
considered as one unit (a noun phrase) in Kuna, and the suffix is added to the end of the noun phrase: noun +
(adjective + suffix).
Examples
    1. neg totogin              ‗in the little house‘
    2. ul tummadgin             ‗in the big canoe‘
9.4 Grammar                                                                                                    1059.4.1.3 Noun modified by another noun
One noun may be used to modify another noun when it is necessary to talk about a specific part of a whole
object. In this case, the (whole) object precedes the part of the object.
Examples
       1. kallin nono         ‗chicken head‘
       2. ti nak              ‗river mouth‘
Sometimes one noun is used to modify the meaning of the other noun. In this case the modifying noun comes
first.
Examples
    1. ormaked neg              ‗meeting house‘
    2. ulmol ul                 ‗sail boat‘
    3. nono kal                 ‗skull bone‘
Exercise 4. Noun phrase varied substitution drill
The teacher says the frame and then a word from the list below. The student repeats the frame, inserting the
adjective said by the teacher.
Examples      Teacher: Machi ul tummad takcha.
              Teacher: pin
              Student: Machi ul pin takcha.
              Teacher: Machi ul pin takcha.
              Teacher: olobi
              Student: Machi ul olobi takcha.
Frame         Machi ul ____ takcha.        ‗The boy saw ____ canoe.‘
     1. tummad                ‗big‘
     2. toto                  ‗small‘
     3. pin                   ‗new‘
     4. chered                ‗old‘
     5. olobi                 ‗empty‘
     6. ena                   ‗full‘
     7. nued                  ‗good‘
     8. istar                 ‗bad‘
     9. karki                 ‗expensive‘
    10. muis                  ‗inexpensive‘
Exercise 5. Noun phrase suffix drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 in which the suffix is attached to the noun. The teacher then says the adjective. The
student responds by inserting the adjective with the proper suffix into the sentence. The drill should be repeated
several times.
Example       Teacher: Es ulgin mai.
              Teacher: toto
              Student: Es ul totogin mai.
     1a. Es ulgin mai.                       ‗The machete is in the canoe.‘
      b. toto                                ‗small‘
     2a. Es mesagin mai.                     ‗The machete is on the table.‘
      b. kinnid                              ‗red‘
     3a. Pundin nad.                         ‗The girl (on the one hand) went.‘
      b. tummad                              ‗big‘
106                                                                                Basic Health/Medical Discussion      4a. Machidin pes.                       ‗The boy (on the other hand) stayed.‘
       b. toto                                ‗little‘
      5a. Machi yalbal nad.                   ‗The boy went to the mountain.‘
       b. tummad                              ‗big‘9.4.1.4 Limitation of the noun phrase
In general, a Kuna noun phrase may contain only one adjective. (A means of modifying a noun with more than
one adjective is discussed in 9.4.4.3) There is, however, an exception. Occasionally, a noun and adjective are so
closely associated in the mind of the speaker that they are considered one concept. Take, for example, the
English words ―pink eye.‖ Although the phrase ―pink eye‖ is made up of two words, actually only one idea, a
type of disease, is communicated.
The Kuna words tule tummad ‗leader‘ are an example of two words conveying one concept. A noun phrase
which contains two words but one concept may be further modified by a number.
Example        Tule tummad walpá nad.         ‗The three leaders went.‘9.4.2 Negation of adjectives (Ex. 6)
Although most negated adjectives function as do negated adjectives in English and Spanish, there is an
idiomatic use of the negated adjective which is unique in Kuna (discussed below in 2). With few exceptions, the
negation of an adjective varies according to whether the adjective ends in a vowel or a consonant.","[117, 118, 119]"
"2. Keep others talking
In learning Kuna, an important part of the process is ―listen, listen, listen.‖a. Reason
This is useful in several ways:
1. Hearing the language in its natural context gives good reliable correlation between the situation and the
   appropriate intonation, grammar and vocabulary.
2. You increase your ability to divide up a torrent of speech into meaningful pieces so that you understand
   what is being said.
3. You increase your ability to visualize the situation under discussion without having to go through some
   intermediate language.
4. Constantly hearing the intonation and grammatical patterns tends to reinforce them in your own mind.
5. Hearing a word used in different contexts helps define the area of meaning of a word, e.g., neg is found to
   mean ―house or building.‖ It is also used to refer to the ―village‖ (as opposed to the surrounding
   countryside) or a ―field.‖ It is also used as a ―place‖ in general.b. Problem
The problem is that in Kuna, like most languages, you have to show your interest in what is being said by
responding in the appropriate way, or the person will feel that you aren‘t interested and stop talking. In Kuna,
this is done by so-called conversation sustainers such as mmmm, ajáj, or repeating the last important phrase
of what was being said. These conversation sustainers should be used right from the beginning, starting with the
more simple neutral ones such as mmmm and injecting them at random until you can distinguish the
appropriate places to use them.",[324]
"9.4 Grammar
Adjectives
Adjectives in Kuna, as in Spanish and English, are modifiers of a person or object and are used in conjunction
with the noun in order to describe it more fully. Most Kuna adjectives are part of a noun phrase and convey a
concept similar to the English/Spanish adjectival concept. Since some aspects of negation of adjectives and of
Kuna color are unique, they are described apart from the general discussion on adjectives. The formation of
attributive and existence sentences is also unique.",[117]
"      3) Relationships
      After dealing with pressing problems, work through a list of universal grammatical relationships139 and see
      which ones you can handle. Next, make a list of what would appear to be the most useful for you to use.
      Then use this as a basis for your investigation.e. Process
Plan for the following stages in investigation:
1. gather data
2. hypothesize (guess what the grammar rule is)
3. check your hypothesis

There are several books which adequately deal with this subject and it is beyond my purpose here to deal
extensively with this subject. However, there are two cardinal rules worth repeating:a. Write it down
When you gather information (language data), write it down. Otherwise, you (in common with humankind) will
forget it.b. Filing
The information written down must be filed in such a way as you can readily ―find‖ it.c. Rate
Don’t gather information faster than you can digest (process) it, or it will drown you. For example, don‘t sit
down and gather 100 new words. Just take 5–10 new words, write them down, check their meaning, learn them
and use them. Then, and only then, gather another 5–10 new words or one grammatical device and assimilate
that.

"3.2.5 Pronunciation of monosyllabic words (Ex. 11)
Monosyllabic words are words which have only one syllable. Kuna words which are made up of only one vowel
and one consonant, or of only one vowel are pronounced by lengthening the vowel. When such monosyllabic
words are said in isolation or at the end of a sentence, the tone slides down (down glides).
Examples
    1. ti             ‗water‘
    2. an             ‗branch‘
    3. u              ‗nest‘
Exercise 11. Pronunciation of monosyllabic words
The teacher says a word from the list below, and the student repeats the word after the teacher, mimicking as
closely as possible the down glide in these monosyllabic words.
Example    Teacher: ti
           Student: ti
     1. ti         ‗water‘
     2. no         ‗frog‘
     3. ka         ‗hot peppers‘
     4. pe         ‗you‘
     5. ku         ‗louse‘
     6. ma         ‗to peck‘
     7. ne         ‗Go!‘
     8. ni         ‗moon‘
     9. po         ‗to cry‘
    10. tu         ‗(species of) armadillo‘
    11. a          ‗that‘
    12. e          ‗his/her/its‘
    13. u          ‗nest‘3.3 Culture
When people first meet, there is usually an exchange of questions which helps the people become acquainted.
Cultures differ as to the questions which may be politely asked in such a situation.
Questions about where you have come from and where you are going are quite acceptable in Kuna. The
question, ―When are you leaving?‖ is also often asked. That question does not have the same negative
connotation it does in English, but rather implies the idea of, ―How long are you staying?‖ Questions
concerning your parents, brothers and sisters, and wife/husband and children are bound to follow.
28                                                                                                  Conversational RepliesIn Kuna, it is quite acceptable to ask the price of items bought. If the item was a gift there is no need to disclose
the value.
Great care should be taken when inquiring about the success of a hunting or fishing trip. Direct questions
concerning the kill or the catch may be interpreted as a request/demand to share in the proceeds. It is much
more acceptable to ask what happened on the trip than to ask what was killed or caught.","[40, 41]"
"                                                                 273

     When the topic of conversation is the subject of the sentence, ad(e) ‗he/she/it‘ or amal(a) ‗they‘ is used.
Examples
    1. ¿Ade pia nad?                           ‗Where did he go?‘
    2. Amal pato nanmal.                       ‗They‘ve already left.‘b) Topical non-subject
     When the topic of conversation is not the subject of the sentence, the third-person pronoun tar is used plus
     the appropriate suffix if one is required.
Example        An targa chogzha.               ‗I said to him.‘2) Non-topical third-person pronoun
     When the subject is not the topic, it is possible to leave out the pronouns which refer to the subject.
     Elsewhere in the sentence a non-topic element may be referred to by a pronoun.a) Non-subject, non-topic in the first-person narrative
     In first-person narrative, the third-person pronoun ne accompanied by the appropriate suffix is used
     everywhere in the subject position.
Examples
    1. An ne mecha.              ‗I killed it.‘
    2. An nega chog.             ‗I said to him.‘b) Non-subject, non-topic in third-person narrative
     In third-person narrative, the pronoun te is used to refer to the direct object.
Examples
     1. Pablo te mecha.         ‗Paul killed it (that same one).‘
     2. An te ukcha.            ‗I sold it (that same one).‘
    In the case of the indirect object, the indirect object suffix -ga occurs alone without an accompanying
    pronoun.
Example        Luis ga chogal.                 ‗Louis began to say to him.‘3) Continuity of paragraph topic
     The topic of a conversation (discourse) tends to occur as the subject of the sentences throughout the
     paragraphs that make up the conversation. Sometimes, however, the topic of the conversation becomes the
     direct or indirect object of a sentence. In English, the passive voice is used to indicate that the topic in that
     particular sentence is not the actor, ―John was hit by a car.‖
      In Kuna, when the topic of the conversation becomes the direct/indirect object of one of the sentences, it is
      placed in the first position of the sentence and there is a slight pause before the remainder of the utterance
      is said. The third person pronoun tar accompanied by the appropriate suffix occurs in the object position.
Example      Juan, achu tar kucha.          ‗John was bitten by the dog.‘
    When the topic of a paragraph is not the topic of the conversation nor the subject in a given sentence, it is
    placed at the beginning of the sentence followed by a slight pause; there is no pronoun in the
    object/indirect object position.
20.4 Grammar                                                                                                              275Example            Anita, achu kucha.                  ‗Anita was bitten by the dog.‘20.4.1.2 Pronominal reference
In Kuna, a third-person pronoun can only be used once or twice before the noun to which the pronoun refers
must be repeated. Where ambiguity could arise, the noun is preceded by te ‗that same‘ to ensure that the listener
realizes the reference is to the same person/object as before.
Example
               Ome noni. Te omedina, Luis e nan itos.                ‗A woman arrived. That same woman (is) Louis‘
                                                                     mother (you) understand.‘20.4.1.3 Subject in indirect speech
In indirect speech, the person being quoted is referred to by the pronoun ede or e plus the appropriate suffix.
The suffix -chog/-zhog/-jog attaches to the verb which describes the action of the person under discussion (see
15.4.3).
Examples
    1. Ede nejog.                                                ‗(He) said (that) he is going.‘
    2. Sagla chog Pedro, ede ne(jog).                            ‗The chief said that Peter was going.‘20.4.2 First-person exclusive subject pronoun
The first-person exclusive pronoun nan121 is used by the speaker to refer to himself and those accompanying
him in an action, but to exclude the people/person to whom he is speaking. When the addressee is included, the
suffix -mal is added to the first-person pronoun an.
Examples
    1. Nanmal pato mas kucha.                          ‗We (not you) already ate the food.‘
    2. Anmal pato mas kucha.                           ‗We (including you) already ate the food.‘20.4.3 Demonstratives
Demonstratives are used to point out a person/thing to whom/which the speaker is referring, in a manner similar
to the English demonstratives ―this‖ and ―that.‖
In Kuna, they may be used in isolation as pronouns or as adjectives preceding the noun to which they refer; or
they may be suffixed and function as adverbs. They have a restricted use in discourse situations.
There are four demonstrative pronouns in Kuna: iti, we, a and te. Iti ‗this‘ and we ‗that‘ are used to refer to
people/things that are within seeing distance of the speaker (in the speaker‘s presence), a ‗that‘ refers to a
person/thing outside the speaker‘s setting (presence), and te ‗that same‘ is used to reinforce a back reference
and confirm that the same person/object is being referred to as was previously mentioned.
The demonstratives frequently occur at the beginning of a sentence, since the item they refer to is often topic.
Examples
    1. Iti (mol) an pakne.                                           ‗I am going to buy this (blouse) (which is right here).‘
    2. We (mol) an pakchul.                                          ‗I won‘t buy that (blouse) (over there).‘
    3. A (tule) odurtalegenab.                                       ‗That person (who is not here) should be punished.‘
    4. ... ¿Ibi nika tede?                                           ‗... What‘s wrong with that (person about whom we
                                                                     have been talking)?‘
        5.     Pe iti uko.                                           ‗Sell this.‘121
      The final n of nan is fortis nn but is written as a single letter by convention (see 2.2.3.4 footnote 8).
276                                                                                                      Classifications20.4.3.1 Demonstrative adjectives
A demonstrative used as an adjective precedes the noun to which it refers. Often this person/item is not only
topic, but is also being singled out or contrasted with another. In this case, the noun is suffixed with the topic
marker -tin/-din (see Appendix E).
Examples
    1. Iti moldin nued.                                ‗This blouse (is) good.‘
    2. We esdin nugal nika.                            ‗This machete (is) sharp.‘
    3. Pe we tulega chogo.                             ‗Tell that person (over there).‘20.4.3.2 Demonstrative adverbs
The locative suffixes -gin/-kin and -bal/-pal (see Section 8.4) may be attached to any of the demonstrative
pronouns to give the connotation of a narrow or broad setting adverb.
Examples
    1. Es itigin mellemai.                             ‗The machete is (lying around) right here.‘
    2. Es wegin mellemai.                              ‗The machete is (lying around) right over there.‘
    3. Es webal mellemai.                              ‗The machete is (lying around) somewhere over there.‘20.4.3.3 Forward and backward reference to demonstration
The suffix -ob122 may be added to the demonstrative pronouns we ‗that‘ and te ‗that same‘ to express a concept
similar to the English ―like that‖ or ―in that manner‖.
Weob ‗like this‘ is used to refer forward to what is going to be said or demonstrated, or to what has just been
demonstrated. Teob ‗like that‘ is used to refer backwards to what was said.
Examples
    1. Weob be imako.                  ‗Do it like this.‘
    2. Teob be imako.                  ‗Do it like that (as I told you).‘20.4.3.4 Specific use of we and a in discourse
During a conversation or speech, that is to say, in discourse and in a written text, the demonstrative pronoun we
‗that‘ is used as an adjective before the noun plus suffix -din/-tin to refer to the topic under discussion.
Non-topic people/things are referred to by the demonstrative pronoun a ‗that‘ before the noun. Te ‗that same‘ is
used to refer to a previously mentioned non-topic item where ambiguity might arise from the use of several
successive third-person pronouns. In such cases, the listener might understand the speaker to be introducing
other actors/objects into the story.
Examples
    1. We tuledin, tule nued.                          ‗That person (about whom we are speaking) is a good person.‘
   2a. Machidin yannu takcha.                          ‗The boy saw a peccary.‘
    b. A yannudin igalgin mellemai.                    ‗That peccary was sprawled out on the trail.‘
    c. Te yannudin purkwis, takcha.                    ‗That same peccary was dead, (you) see.‘20.4.4 Indefinite and indeterminate pronouns20.4.4.1 Indefinite pronouns
The third-person pronoun amal ‗they‘ (see 1.4.2 and 8 4.3) may be used to refer to unknown or unspecified
people.122
      -ob(i) is a contracted form of -yob(i) ‗like‘ (see 19.4.12.3).

Example
           Kwentin ua kumpi; kwentin chuga.             ‗Some (a group) want to eat fish; some (want to eat)
                                                        crab.‘
                                 123
g. kwentin ... piddin/pimaladdin ‗some ... others ...‘ is usually used in a situation of a more marked contrast
between two parts of a group than is referred to by kwentin ... kwentin ‗some ... ; some ...‘.
Example
        Kwentin ua kumpi tenal pimaladdin chul.             ‗Some want to eat fish while others don‘t.‘

Example
         Tule sate pe pentagal.            ‗There is nobody to help you.‘
l. nikchulchal ‗almost no one/none‘ excludes all but a few from the group.
Example
        Tule nikchulchal mani               ‗Almost no people have money. (Almost no one has money.)‘
Another way of excluding the entire group is with the expression nikchul ‗not one‘.
Example
       Tule kwen nikchul pe pentagal.                     ‗There is not a single person to help you.‘20.4.6 Reflexive pronouns
In Kuna, as in English, reflexive pronouns are used to indicate that an actor is doing an action to
himself/herself/itself. Reflexive pronouns are also used in a construction which indicates volition. There are two
reflexive pronouns: naga ‗myself‘ and aga ‗yourself/himself/herself/itself‘ and these follow the noun or
pronoun referring to the subject of the sentence.
Examples
    1. Antin naga chikcha.                      ‗I cut myself.‘
    2. ¿Pedin aga chikcha?                      ‗Did you cut yourself?‘
    3. Machi aga chikcha.                       ‗The boy cut himself.‘20.4.6.1 Group marker with reflexive pronoun
When a reflexive pronoun is used to refer to a group of people/things who are doing the action to themselves,
the group marker -mal (see 13.4.3) is added to the noun or pronoun which refers to the participants. It is also
added to the verb.
123
   kwentin, piddin and pimaladdin are formed by adding the topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin to an indefinite pronoun
stem.
20.4 Grammar                                                                                                        279Examples
      1. Anmal naga pezhe chikchamal.                 ‗We (including you) cut ourselves badly.‘
      2. Nanmal naga chikchamal.                      ‗We (excluding you) cut ourselves.‘
      3. ¿Pemal aga chikchamal?                       ‗Did you (plural) cut yourselves?‘
      4. Machimal aga chikchamal.                     ‗The boys cut themselves.‘
When the people in the group are acting reciprocally, i.e., doing the action to each other, the actors are stated
with the group marker -mal. The third-person reflexive pronoun is followed by the repeated third-person
pronoun which has the group marker -mal. The verb also has the group marker -mal added.
Examples
     1. ¿Pemal aga emal-emal chikchamal?                 ‗Did you cut each other?‘
     2. Machimal aga emal-emal chikchamal.               ‗The boys cut each other.‘
     3. Tulemal aga emal-emal chogalmal pede             ‗The people said among themselves that you were a
           tule nued.                                    good person.‘
When there are two actors acting one toward the other, the third-person reflexive pronoun is used. It is followed
by the second participant in the action to which the accompaniment suffix -bak/-pak has been added. The group
marker suffix -mal is added to the verb.
Example       Pun aga machibak sakismal. ‗The girl and boy hit each other.‘20.4.6.2 Volition
The Kuna construction which parallels the English phrase, ―of his own volition,‖ is expressed by using the
appropriate reflexive pronoun followed by tukin (see 20.4.8).
Examples
    1. An naga tukin nad.                     ‗I went myself (of my own free will).‘
    2. Machi aga tukin es pakcha.             ‗The boy bought the machete himself (of his own volition).‘20.4.7 Affirmation20.4.7.1 Contrastive affirmation
A speaker may affirm one idea/action in contrast with another. For example, in the case of ―the youth doesn‘t
know how to make a canoe, but the elder does,‖ the (village) elder‘s skill is affirmed in contrast to the youth‘s
lack of experience. This concept is expressed in Kuna by the contrastive affirmation suffix -diji/-tiji.
Example
           Machi wichul ul chob tenal taddiji.             ‗The youth doesn‘t know how to make a canoe but the
                                                           elder does.‘20.4.7.2 Emphatic affirmation
In English, a speaker may affirm that it was indeed the subject who did the action by stressing a reflexive
pronoun which refers to the actor or he may affirm the carrying out of the verb by stressing the verb itself. The
verb may also be affirmed by the use of an adverb such as ―really, truly, indeed.‖
In Kuna, the subject may be affirmed by adding the affirmation suffix -d(e)/-t(e) to the first-person and
second-person pronoun subject and -de/-te to nouns referring to all other subjects. It may also be affirmed by
the use of the adverb chunnad ‗(it was) really (I/you/he/we/they)‘.
Examples
    1. Annid takcha.                          ‗I saw (it) myself.‘
    2. ¿Ped takcha?                           ‗Did you see (it) yourself?‘
    3. Machide takcha.                        ‗The boy saw it himself.‘
    4. Ade takcha.                            ‗He saw (it) himself.‘
280                                                                                                   Classifications      5. An chunnad takcha.                 ‗(It was) really I (who) saw (it).‘
The action may be affirmed by adding the affirmation suffix -de/-te to the verb or by using the adverb
chunchunnad ‗really/actually‘.
Examples
    1. Anid takchade.                          ‗I myself saw (it).‘
    2. ¿Pe takchade?                           ‗You saw (it)?‘
    3. An chunchunnad takcha.                  ‗I really saw (it).‘20.4.8 Contrary-to-fact (Ex. 5)
To this point in the discussion of Kuna grammar, most situations have been likely to come to pass or did,
indeed, happen. There are times, however, when one needs to use expressions which parallel the English
construction ‗had ... happened (although it did not)‘ or ‗I wish ... had happened (but it didn‘t)‘. Such situations
are called condition contrary-to-fact or hypothetical situations. An example of an English contrary-to-fact
sentence is, ―Had I gone, I would have gotten wet.‖ This is contrary-to-fact because the person did not go and
did not get wet.
In Kuna, a condition contrary-to-fact sentence is formed by adding the contrary-to-fact suffix -n to the verbs in
both the conditional and main clauses of a conditional sentence (see 14.4.5). Various shades of meaning are
indicated by the use of different aspects and tenses in the main and subordinate clauses.
Many contrary-to-fact constructions are rare. For the purpose of this discussion, general principles are given to
guide in the construction of contrary-to-fact expressions, and some of the more commonly-used constructions
are listed by way of example. 12420.4.8.1 General principles used in construction of more common contrary-to-fact sentences

In Kuna, a polite contradiction of a statement parallels the English construction, ―If that had been true/so, (this)
would have been fine/okay.‖

The English concept of wishing is expressed in Kuna by the use of a contrary-to-fact conditional clause
accompanied by the adverb nabirin ‗it would be good‘ in the main clause. This construction basically parallels
the English expression ―It would be nice to/for ...‖ or ―I wish for/to ...‖. As in English, the Kuna optative
construction is used in situations which are much less likely to materialize than are situations which employ the
desiderative suffix -bi/-pi ‗to want to ...‘ (see Section 2.4.2).
Examples
    1. An motor pin nikalen, nabirin.                    ‗I wish I had a new motor. (Lit.: If I were to have a
                                                         new motor, it would be good.)‘
     2. An motor pin nikujalen, nabirin.                 ‗I wish I had had a new motor. (Lit.: If I had had a new
                                                         motor, it would have been good.)‘
     3. An mas kuchalen, nabirin.                        ‗I wish had eaten. (Lit.: If I had eaten it would have
                                                         been nice.)‘
The optative construction is also used to wish something for someone else and parallels the English
construction, ―May you....‖
Examples
    1. Pe nugujalen, nabirin.                                       ‗May you get well.‘
    2. Pab Tummad be nugu takelen, nabirin.                         ‗May God bless you. (Lit.: It would be well if God
                                                                    would look well on you.)‘20.4.8.4 “Almost, but not quite”
An event which almost transpired, but did not, is described by using the immediate future suffix -ne followed
by the contrary-to-fact suffix -n.
Examples
    1. Machi iche napi purkwenen.                     ‗The boy almost died.‘
    2. Mu aglenen.                                    ‗The old woman almost fell.‘20.4.9 Past perfect aspect suffix -n
The past perfect aspect parallels the English construction, ―he had previously finished eating,‖ in contrast to the
completive aspect which parallels, ―he finished eating.‖ The past perfect is formed by adding the suffix -n after
the completive suffix. This -n should be distinguished carefully from the one occurring in contrary-to-fact
constructions (see 20.4.8).
Example
         Amal iktual pato mas kuchan.                     ‗They had already eaten beforehand.‘
Note that with the positional verbs nai, mai, ti, etc., the perfective form with -n means that the position has
since terminated. In the case of the suffix form -nai, -di/-ti, etc., the action in progress has since terminated.
Examples
    1. ¿Pia pe tin?                                   ‗Where had you been?‘
    2. Pabdin main.                                   ‗Father had been home.‘
    3. An mas kunnain.                                ‗I had been eating.‘
126
      In this irregular case, the final n of nabirin becomes d before the suffix -din.
20.4 Grammar                                                                                                               28320.4.10 Probability/possibility
Events, actions, and people/things may be described in terms of probabilities or possibilities.
If an event is probably true/going to happen, the suffix -chulchi/-julchi ‗Is it not?‘ is added to the verb of the
main sentence.
Examples
      1. ¿Pe nejulchi?                      ‗You are going, are you not?‘
      2. ¿Pabdin nadchulchi?                ‗Father went, did he not?‘
When an action or noun (phrase) is described as a probability, the suffix -dewa/-tewa127 is added to the verb or
noun (phrase).
Examples
      1. ¿Pe anka immal chedodewa?                     ‗Will you probably bring something for me?‘
      2. An manigin uknedewa.                          ‗I‘m probably going to sell (it) for money.‘
      3. An mol pakne; kinniddewa.                     ‗I‘m going to buy cloth; probably red cloth.‘
If something is a possibility and by no means certain, the suffix -dowa/-towa ‗possibly‘ is added to the
appropriate verb or noun (phrase).
Examples
    1. ¿Pe mol paknedowa?                                ‗Are you perhaps/possibly going to buy blouses?‘
    2. An Pedro panamabal takodowa.                      ‗I will perhaps see Peter in Panama.‘
    3. An wichi toa sagla palmine; Pedrodowa.            ‗I don‘t know whom the chief is going to send, Peter
                                                         perhaps.‘
The suffix -wa is also added to question words to indicate possibility.
Examples
    1. ¿Pia?                       ‗Where?‘
    2. ¿Inkwa?                     ‗When?‘
    3. ¿Ibi?                       ‗What?‘
    4. ¿Piawa?                     ‗Where could it (possibly) be?‘
    5. ¿Inkwawa?                   ‗When could it (possibly) happen?‘
    6. ¿Ibiwa?                     ‗What‘s wrong? (Lit.: What possibly?)‘20.4.11 Alternatives
The stating of alternatives in Kuna is complex: both of the alternatives are stated. Several ways are used to
express alternatives.","[286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296]"
"      2) Active listening
      A less profitable way is to listen actively. Sometimes it‘s just not wise to track the speaker, so this is the
      best you can do. Think about what you are hearing. Don‘t only pay attention to the content (or meaning) of
      what is being said, but also to the way it is said. Sometimes you should concentrate on everything that is
      being said. Other times you should select a particular feature and zero in on that, e.g., where a listener
      inserts a conversation sustainer, or if there is some pattern to how one of them is used.
Appenxix N                                                                                                       313     3) Passive listening
     This is just listening to what is being said, without thinking about the intonation, grammatical construction
     used, etc. This does not mean that you have ―switched off‖ the speaker. It means that you listen to the
     speaker, like you listen to English, to hear what he is saying.c. Noting the setting
This is as important as the tracking or listening itself. It‘s no use knowing patterns of intonation, grammar, etc.,
if you don‘t know when to use them. So, whenever you are listening, notice the following:
1. What incident triggered what the speaker is saying? Was it a question? Was it an allegation? Was it what
   happened? Was it what the speaker had failed to do?
2. What is the speaker‘s emotional attitude? Is he happy, sad, angry, afraid or doubtful? Is he defensive,
   aggressive, involved, neutral or trying to disassociate himself from something?
3. What is the relative status between the speaker and the listener? Is the speaker of higher or lower status? Is
   the difference in status being ignored or even reversed?
4. Is the speaker using his authority or trying to manipulate someone? Is he only pleading?
5. Is he serious or speaking in jest?d. Gestures
Note the accompanying gestures and facial expressions.","[325, 326]"
"1. Goal of language learning
The ultimate goal of language learning is to be completely bilingual; to be able to say anything you want to
express with all the nuances of meaning and shades of emotion with as much facility as you can in your first
language (mother tongue). Although few people really achieve this goal, it is something for which we should all
aim. However, for our encouragement along the way, there are various stages (levels) of achievement. The
following is one scheme:
Stage 1: When you are able to greet people and say goodbye.
Stage 2: When you are also able to exchange pleasantries.
Stage 3: When you are able to parrot fixed phrases, dealing with essential needs such as food, shelter, a guide,
         directions, basic buying and selling.
Stage 4: When you are able to communicate effectively in the specialized areas where you have most contact
         such as medical, trade, teaching or work projects.
Stage 5: When you are able to communicate, generally, in all common aspects of everyday life with a limited
         number of verb aspects (tenses).
Stage 6: When you are able to control reasonably well most normal grammatical relationships such as
         cause-effect, time, location, condition, purpose, ability, possibility and motion verbs.
Stage 7: When you are fluent in any non-abstract area up through Stage 6 and reasonably control focus and
         emphasis.
Stage 8: When you are able to talk about the abstract, present an argument, use figures of speech, etc.
Stage 9: When you are able to discuss emotions, values ,and able to discuss life from the Kuna philosophical
         viewpoint.
Goal: Absolute bilingualism.",[320]
"9.4.5.1 Hunger and thirst
Only one word, ukul/ukulu is used to describe both hunger and thirst in Kuna.
Example
       An ukul nika.                ‗I am hungry/thirsty.‘ (lit.: ‗I have hunger/thirst.‘)9.4.5.2 Sickness
Various Kuna words refer to being sick, however; the most common are the adjective ye ‗sick‘ and the noun
poni ‗sickness‘. The term poni also means ‗problem‘.
Examples
    1. An ye.                       ‗I am sick.‘
    2. An poni nika.                ‗I have (a) sickness/problem.‘9.4.5.3 General health question
There are two common questions that may be used to refer to the general state of a person‘s health or well
being.
Examples
    1. ¿Ibi nika?                   ‗What is the matter?/What (disease) do you have?‘
    2. ¿Igi ito?                    ‗How do you feel?‘9.4.6 Suffix of excess -rba41
An expression which parallels the English construction ‗(one) who ____ excessively/in excess‘ is conveyed by
adding the suffix -rba to the long form of the verb stem.
Examples
    1. We tule kal nikarba.                         ‗That person is excessively (extremely) strong.‘
    2. We tule kwallu nikarba.                      ‗That person is excessively fat.‘
    3. We tule mas kunnerba.                        ‗That person is a glutton.‘ (lit.: ‗He eats excessively.‘)
    4. We tule ua chwaerba.                         ‗That person is a fanatic fisherman.‘ (lit.: ‗He fishes excessively.‘)9.4.7 Existence sentence (Ex. 15)
An existence sentence parallels the Spanish/English construction, Hay elefantes. ‗There are elephants‘. It
confirms or negates the existence of something. The Kuna existence clause is formed by stating the noun which
exists, followed by the verb nika ‗to have‘. Generally speaking, nika is used in the same sense of a
person/animal owning or possessing something. In the case of possession, an owner, and sometimes the object
owned, are named with the verb.41
   -rba is actually derivational suffix -r ‗adjectivizer‘ (used with a verb) plus -ba ‗adjective intensifier‘. For example, yer
‗fine/good‘ and yerba ‗very good‘.
114                                                                                Basic Health/Medical DiscussionExamples
       1. An nika.               ‗I have (it).‘
       2. An mani nika.          ‗I have money.‘
In the case of an existence sentence, only the object which exists occurs with the verb nika ‗to have‘. Usually
the context makes the meaning of an existence sentence clear.
Example       Mani nika.                      ‗There is money.‘

10.1 Dialogue
Grouping of objects, people and actions is a very important aspect of conversation; several illustrations of it
occur in the following dialogue.
     1.  Old man        ¿Machi, pia ne?                       ‗Young man, where are (you) going?‘
         (calling out):
The young man approaches the older man.
     2.    Young man:       Pukurbal ne.                      ‗(I‘m) going to Pucuru.‘
     3.    Old man:         Mmmm. ¿Toa ne?                    ‗Oh! Who is going?‘
     4.    Young man:       Anni, Ricardo, Enrique;           ‗Richard, Henry and I, (three of us) are going to go.‘
                            walapá ne.
     5.    Old man:         ¿Ricardo nemo?                    ‗Richard too?‘
     6.    Young man:       Eye, nemo.                        ‗Yes, he is going too.‘
     7.    Old man:         Aaa. ¿Inkwa noniko?               ‗Oh! When will you return?‘
     8.    Young man:       Pane.                             ‗Tomorrow.‘

      Although jáj ‗challenge‘ is often used to make a real question (one that expects an answer) into a
      rhetorical question (one that doesn‘t expect an answer), in a wider sense, it is used to challenge the listener
      to dispute or contradict what he has said.
Example        ¿Inkwa pe takcha, jáj?          ‗When did you see (it), (go on tell me)?‘5) -chulchi/-zhulchi/-julchi
      When the speaker feels that the audience is in agreement with him, the appeal for agreement is a mere
      formality and the point will be willingly conceded, the suffix -chulchi/-zhulchi/-julchi ‗Isn‘t that so?‘ is
      used (see Monologue 19.1, Sentence 2).
Example
           Teun Pedro maimojulchi.                          ‗At that time Peter was home, wasn‘t he? (Everybody
                                                            knows he was.)‘6) itos
      The marker itos ‗(you) understand‘ is used to mark explanatory comments of background or additional
      information (see Dialogue 15.1, Sentence 11).
Example        An pega ochi ukmogo itos.       ‗I‘ll give you a candy too, (you understand).‘7) takcha/taikcha
      The marker takcha/taikcha ‗you understand‘ is also used to appeal/ask for understanding. However,
      takcha is used with mainline information such as the main points of an argument, or an important
      explanation on which the outcome of the story is dependent (see Section 20.1, Sentence 5).
Example
           An pega mani uko, anka immal pakegal ,           ‗I‘ll give you some money, see, to buy me something.‘
           takcha.8) takenye
      The marker takenye ‗appeal for credibility‘ is used when the speaker is appealing for the believing
      support of the listener(s). It is used extensively in storytelling and in narrating of personal or reported
      experiences (see 20.1, Sentence 17).
Example        Teun achu mai takenye.          ‗At that time tiger was living/at home (you) see.‘9) takenchogye
      The marker takenchogye ‗(appeal) for credibility of what was said‘ has the same meaning as takenye
      except that it relates to what was said instead of what happened (see 20.1, Sentence 20).
Example
           Koe chogal: --An ne tegil, takenchogye.          ‗Deer said, ―I‘m going then,‖ (you understand that he
                                                            said it).‘10) chogeye
      The marker chogeye ‗it is said‘ is used when the speaker disclaims any responsibility for what is said. It is
      usually assumed to be fiction (see 20.1, Sentence 4).
20.5 Vocabulary                                                                                                     287Example       Koe mai chogeye.                ‗Once upon a time, deer was living/at home.‘11) chogchundo
     The expression chogchundo ‗it is said and it is supposed to be true‘ is used when the speaker is claiming
     what he said to be true but at the same time he is not accepting the responsibility for what is being said.
Example
          Tadgan maidgin teob kuschogchundo.               ‗That‘s what happened when the ancestors were alive.
                                                           (They say it is true.)‘12) itoleye
     The speaker is advising his listener that the statement itoleye ‗it is understood‘ is surmise on the part of
     someone other than himself (see 20.1, Sentence 30).
Example       Koe untar immal mecha itoleye.           ‗Deer killed many creatures (it is) understood.‘20.5    Vocabulary

           APPENDIX A: LONG AND SHORT WORD FORMS
In Kuna, many words and suffixes (though not all) have long and short forms. That is to say, certain words or
suffixes occur in various specific situations with the final vowel and in others it is deleted, without altering the
meaning of the word or suffix. The use of the short form of words/suffixes is more common, while the use of
the long form is more restricted. The number of words/suffixes which have both long and short forms varies
according to the class of word; these are listed in Section 1 below. General rules for predicting which
words/suffixes have a long or short form are given in Section 2, and rules governing the use of the long form are
given in Section 3.","[298, 299, 300, 301]"
"3.4 Grammar
3.4.1 Yes/No questions
As stated in 3.2.3.2, the order of words in a question requiring an eye ‗yes‘ or chuli ‗no‘ answer is the same as
the order of the words in a statement. In conversation, a question is distinguished from a statement by
intonation. In writing, a question is distinguished from a statement by punctuation (question marks).
Example         ¿Pe mas tune?                     ‗Are you going to cook?‘3.4.2 Verb tense aspect - immediate future (Ex. 12–16)
When an event is viewed by the speaker as being imminent (the action will undoubtedly take place), the
tense-aspect11 used is called the immediate future. In using the immediate future, keep two things in mind: the
immediate future suffix is added to the verb and a time reference must be either stated or implied.",[41]
"3.4.5.1 Change of subject
A common use of the change of subject suffix is the exchange of greetings. One person may ask, ―How are
you?‖ Then the other person answers, ―I am fine. How are you?‖ In this case, the you refers back to the first
speaker. The subject of the dialogue has changed. A Kuna speaker would signal such a change of subject by the
use of the suffix -din.
Example
       Visitor :           ¿Pe igi oipos?           ‗How are you this morning?‘
       Villager:           Ampala. ¿Pedin?          ‗So-so. And you?‘3.4.5.2 Contrast of subject
Kunas also use the suffix -din/-tin to mark a contrast between what two subjects are doing.
Example             Machidin ua makne.                 ‗On the one hand, the boy is going to spear fish.‘
                    Omedin ua tune.                    ‗On the other hand, the woman is going to cook fish.‘

    Helps for distinguishing between short and long fortis consonants at the end of words are given in 4.2.2.
2
    -din becomes -tin after a fortis consonant.

  Beginning with this lesson, both the long and short forms of words—where two exist—are given in the vocabulary.
Parentheses enclose the vowel that is dropped for the short form. If the consonant changes, the two forms are separated by
commas.
                                                4 QUESTIONS
4.1 Dialogue
Question words are extremely useful in finding your way among strangers in a new place. When you have only
partial control of the language, you can question someone until you fully understand what they have been
saying. By fully using the question words—several of which are included in Dialogue 4.1—you can continue a
conversation for a reasonable time, even though you have very little control of the language. They also help the
language learner to become better acquainted with the language and culture.
Wife to her husband about visitors in their village:
      1.    Wife:              ¿Toa noni?                           ‗Who has arrived?‘
      2.    Husband:           Waga.                                ‗An outsider!‘
      3.    Wife:              Mmm. ¿Inkwa noni?                    ‗Hmm. When did he arrive?‘
      4.    Husband:           Immis.                               ‗Today./Just now.‘

4.2.1 Intonation (Ex. 1–2)
In section 3.2.3 the intonation pattern of questions requiring yes/no answers is discussed. Other types of
questions are discussed in this lesson (see 4.4.3 for grammatical explanations). Become familiar with the correct
intonation of questions by doing the following exercises.15
Exercise 1. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 4.1 by humming the intonation. Pay special attention to acknowledgement of the
answer to a question.
Exercise 2. Intonation drill
Mimic the teacher in Dialogue 4.1, formulating the individual sounds as closely as possible without 1) slowing
down, or 2) losing the intonation pattern.","[44, 45, 46]"
"1) Verb form of a very polite command
      A very polite command may be formed in one of three ways:
      a) Insert the suffix -gwel/-kwel between the verb stem and the future aspect suffix -o of the polite
      command form. No subject is used. In the case of the verb ne ‗to go‘, the request command form is
      negwelo, that is to say, the polite command form of the verb, nao, is not used in this construction.
Examples
     1. An pentakkwelo.                      ‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘
     2. Anche taggwelo.                      ‗I would like you to be so kind as to come to me.‘
    b) Use the future aspect form of the verb preceded by the word wis ‗a little‘. In this case (as in future
    statements), the subject is included. The intonation pattern of a command is used.
Example      Pe wis an pentako.              ‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘
    c) Use both the word wis ‗a little‘ and the suffix -gwel/-kwel with the future aspect of the verb. That is to
    say, wis precedes the verb and the suffix -gwel/-kwel is inserted before the future aspect suffix -o in the
    verb. The subject is included.
Example        Pe wis an pentakkwelo.         ‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘2) Additional information stated in the request
      As stated above, a subject must be used when the word wis ‗a little‘ is used in the request command. The
      subject precedes wis and the rest of the very polite command follows normal word order. Wis can be
      repeated before the verb to make the request very polite: vocative + subject + wis + indirect object + direct
      object + verb ( + -gwel/-kwel) ( + -o).
Example
           Pedro, pe wis anka ina (wis) ukkwelo.           ‗Peter, I would like it if you would give me the medicine.‘3) Questioning request
      When the speaker is not sure whether or not the listener can meet a request, he uses a questioning request.
      This construction is formed by using the word wis ‗a little‘ with the suffix -ji following the future suffix.
      A question intonation pattern is used (see 3.2.3). The use of -ji expects a positive (yes) answer.
Example        ¿An wis pentakoji?             ‗Would you be so kind as to help me?‘
Exercise 12. wis very polite command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example        Teacher: Pedro, pe wis an pentako.
               Student: Pedro, pe wis an pentako.
      1. Pedro, pe wis an pentako.         ‗Peter, I would like you to please help me.‘
      2. Nestor, pe wis negzhe nao.        ‗Nestor, I would like you to please go home.‘
      3. Amma, pe wis nanbak nao.          ‗Aunt, I would like you to please go with Mother.‘
      4. Luis, pe wis anche tago.          ‗Louis, I would like you to please come to me.‘
      5. María, pe wis anka tub uko.       ‗Mary, I would like you to please give me some thread.‘

     Living away from the city takes more time for chores, maintenance, etc. This fact has to be recognized and
     planned for.
The above list is not in order of importance or priority. All the items need to be included. None can be left out.c. Planning your contacts with people
Plan what the contact is going to be: a visit, or work party, or meeting, etc. Based on the type of contact, think
of what opportunities there are likely to be for hearing or speaking or learning in Kuna. In view of the
opportunities that are likely to be available, think of what learning devices you will be able to use:     1) Hearing
     1. Tracking
     2. Active listening
     3. Passive listening     2) Talking
     4. Conversing and speaking

      5. Questioning
      6. Recording and writing what is said.
Having decided which learning devices you will probably be able to use, in addition to the general use of
tracking, talking, etc., think of what special features of the intonation, sounds, and grammar you need to
concentrate on.
In view of what features you want to concentrate on, think of what topics you think it would be helpful to steer
the discussion or conversation towards, if given the opportunity.
Assuming that you have an opportunity to steer the conversation, think through how you will achieve this.
Now that you have decided what you need to do, write it down and familiarize yourself with it.
Then think through the whole contact, writing down what you need by way of greeting; establishing topic; your
contribution by way of conversation; some of the ―sustainers‖ you will probably need and closures.
Plan what you intend to do when the conversation winds down. If it is a planned activity, make sure all the
necessary preparations are made.
Plan your exit.d. Plan your investigation of Kuna
In planning further investigation of Kuna, there are several factors to be taken into account:      1) Need
      If you have a situation in which you can‘t express yourself correctly, cropping up several times in a row,
      then this is the logical area to investigate next. For instance, if you have difficulty in expressing when an
      incident will/did take place, then it would be good to investigate time phrases and clauses.","[330, 331]"
"14.4.11.1 Opinion
The position/opinion of the speaker on a particular topic/situation is stated by using the habitual aspect of ―to
think/say‖ followed by a direct or indirect quote, which is the stated position/opinion of the speaker.
Example           Antin chog: ―Nabir.‖86             ‗I think that is fine.‘14.4.11.2 Process of thinking
The process of thinking is expressed by the verb pinzhe ‗to think (about)‘. The verb is preceded by the thought
which is marked by the specific or general suffix -gin/-kin or -bal/-pal (see 14.4.8.1–4).
Example           An nangin pinzheji.                ‗I am just thinking about Mother.‘14.4.11.3 Surmise
Surmise is expressed by the verb ebinzhe ‗to think/surmise‘. The content of the surmise is followed by the
ebinzhe clause.
Example
              Pabdin pato Pukurgin omos, an ebinzhe.              ‗I think Father would have already arrived in Pucuru
                                                                  (by now).‘14.4.12 Exclusive noun suffix -bi/-pi (Ex. 26–27)
The use of the exclusive noun suffix -bi/-pi parallels the English construction ‗only (a certain thing)‘, such as
found in the sentence, ―I eat only cooked plantains.‖ This exclusive construction is used only with the noun
phrase and is achieved by adding -bi/-pi to the last word of the noun phrase, either a noun, an adjective, or a
pronoun.
Examples
    1. An chiglibi takcha.                           ‗I saw only wild turkeys.‘
    2. Macherganbi ormanemal.                        ‗Only the men are all going to the meeting.‘

Exercise 26. Exclusive suffix -bi/-pi frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: Chiglibi pukwa.
              Student: Chiglibi pukwa.
      1. Chiglibi pukwa.                      ‗Only wild turkeys are there.‘
      2. An nalu kinnidbi mecha.              ‗I killed only red macaw parrots.‘
      3. Wagbi noni.                          ‗Only outsiders arrived.‘
      4. An palubi pakcha.                    ‗I bought only salt.‘
      5. Macherganbi ormanemal.               ‗Only the men are all going to meet.‘
Exercise 27. Exclusive suffix -bi/-pi drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, using the exclusive suffix -bi/-pi form.
Example       Teacher: Chigli pukwa.
              Student: Chiglibi pukwa.
      1. Chigli pukwa.                        ‗The wild turkeys are there.‘
      2. Tule tupkin mai.                     ‗Kunas live on the island.‘

The exclusive action adverb unila ‗only‘ indicates that only the particular action mentioned in the sentence is
carried out. The exclusive adverb is placed in the adverbial position in the sentence.
Example       Antin unila murruk ebus.     ‗I only/just touched the cup.‘
Contrast the above example with the following:
Example        Antin murrukpi ebus.           ‗I touched only/just the cup.‘
The first example illustrates the way the adverb excludes any other action. The person ―only touched‖ the cup,
he did not move it or break it. The second example illustrates that it was ―only the cup‖ that was touched, not
the saucer or the glass.
Exercise 28. Exclusive action versus exclusive noun phrase contrast drill
The teacher says the sentence and then says a word or phrase from the sentence, which is to be made exclusive.
The student repeats the sentence adding the exclusive noun suffix -bi/-pi or the exclusive adverb unila ‗only‘ in
the appropriate position. This exercise should be repeated as necessary.
Examples      Teacher: An koe takcha.
              Teacher: koe
              Student: An koebi takcha.

15.1 Dialogue
The giving of orders and commands is important in every culture. Each culture has ―acceptable‖ ways to give a
command, which may vary according to the situation or the relationship of the speaker to the listener.

"14.4.4.1 Irregular response to habitual aspect condition
When the response to the habitual aspect condition is irregular, an appropriate adverb is used to modify the verb
in the independent sentence. Appropriate adverbs include: tigujal ‗usually‘, impagin ‗often‘ and impakwa
‗seldom/rarely‘.77
     -alil is made up of the inceptive aspect -ali plus the prior conditional suffix -l (see 12.4.1.b).

When the response to the habitual aspect condition is regular, the nominalized form of the verb stem in the
conditional clause is followed by the appropriate adverbs. The shape of the adverb (with the exception of ―every
time‖) varies according to the appropriate number stem used. For example, ilbal ‗every time‘, il-ilbogin ‗every
second (other) time‘, and il-ilpagin ‗every third time‘.
Examples
    1. An ai yegued ilbal, an ina che.                          ‗Every time my friend gets sick, I administer

      5. Tad neg chobzha.                ‗The elder built/worked on a house.‘14.4.5 Conditional with –le (Ex. 12)
A conditional sentence parallels the English construction ―If..., then....‖ It is constructed by adding the suffix -le
to the long form of the verb stem or to the suffixed verb in the conditional clause. This construction is used
when the speaker is uncertain whether or not a condition will be fulfilled.
Examples
    1. An mol pakele, an pega uko.                              ‗If I buy cloth, I‘ll give (it) to you.‘
    2. Anmal yannu makmalale, anmal wis chan                    ‗If we shoot a peccary, we will give you a little meat,
         pega ukmogo.78                                         too.‘Exercise 12. Conditional -le frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it, etc.
Example       Teacher: An mol pakele, an mol kinnid pako.
              Student: An mol pakele, an mol kinnid pako.
      1. An mol pakele, an mol kinnid pako.       ‗If I buy cloth, I‘ll buy red (cloth).‘
      2. An ul ukele, an ul toto uko.             ‗If I sell a canoe, I‘ll sell the small one.‘
78
  The indirect object pega occurs after the direct object chan in this example, in order to focus more attention on the one
receiving the meat than on the meat itself.

The purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added to the verb stem of a purpose clause in order to express the purpose for
the action of the independent sentence. It may also be added to certain verbs to form a noun which serves as the
tool with which to perform the action of the verb.
There are three types of purpose clauses; a straightforward explanation of the purpose of the action in the main
clause, a reference to the event that it is hoped will be precipitated by the action in the main clause, and a
reference to the event which it is hoped will be prevented by the action in the main clause.","[191, 192, 193]"
"10.4.1.1 Future suffix
When the time of the future action is unspecific, (―sometime‖), the future suffix -o43 is added to the verb stem or
the verb stem with any of the appropriate suffixes (see 10.4.5).
Examples
    1. An nao.                         ‗I will go (sometime).‘
    2. An kabi kobo.                   ‗I will drink coffee (sometime).‘

         2. An kabo.          ‗I will sleep.‘
         3. An kobo.          ‗I will drink.‘
         4. An poo.           ‗I will cry.‘
         5. An purko.         ‗I will die.‘
Exercise 5. Future suffix drill
The teacher says the verb stem and the student adds the future aspect suffix to the verb stem.

In referring to actions which will take place in the future it is important that you understand the situations in
which the immediate future suffix -ne is indicated versus the situations in which the future suffix -o is indicated.
When the time of a future action is specified, the immediate future suffix -ne is added to the verb. The time may
be specified, for example, pan ‗tomorrow‘ or ibaboje ‗in two days‘, or it may be understood to refer to the time
the speaker is speaking.
Examples
      1. Yoroku, an mas kunne.               ‗At noon, I am going to eat.‘
      2. Nan mas tune.                       ‗Mother is going to cook.‘
(The use of the immediate future suffix -ne indicates that the time refers to the time of the utterance, i.e.,
―now‖.)
      3. Nan mas tuo.                          ‗Mother is going to cook.‘
(The use of the future suffix indicates that the time is unspecific, i.e., ―sometime‖.)
When a time word is used it usually means that the action will take place at a specific time in the future.
However, occasionally a person wishes to communicate that ―sometime‖ during a stated period of time, an
action will take place. In this case, although the time is specified, the future suffix -o is added. This construction
is very rare.
Examples
    1. Pane an kabi kobo.                       ‗Tomorrow (sometime) I will drink coffee.‘
    2. Chedo an mas tuo.                        ‗This evening (sometime) I will cook plantains.‘10.4.1.3 Future of positional verbs
The future of positional verbs is formed by adding the future suffix -o to the short form of the positional verb.
Thus, when nai, mai, ti, etc., refer to a position or state rather than an action, they do not occur with -ne
‗immediate future‘.
Examples
    1. An webal maio.                           ‗I will be there.‘
    2. Eswal ilagin kwichio.                    ‗The spear will be standing by the wall.‘
    3. Pirkagwenche pe ampak tio.               ‗In a year‘s time, you will be (go about) with me.‘
Exercise 6. Immediate future suffix review drill
Review the discussion of the immediate future suffix in Section 3.4.2. Do as many of the exercises as are
necessary to reinforce the use of -ne, paying special attention to the need for a specific time reference.
Exercise 7. Immediate future versus future suffix drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says the time word and the student makes a
sentence using the time word and changing the verb of Sentence 1 to a verb which uses the immediate future
suffix. Sentence 2 is drilled in a similar manner.

         b. pan                                     ‗tomorrow‘10.4.2 Including an additional participant in an action (Ex. 8–9)10.4.2.1 Participants viewed individually
You may wish to refer to a participant performing an action with others, yet wish to view his participation
separately from the participation of the others.
In English, one way of doing this is to name the new participant, the action, and the word ―too‖ or ―also‖ in a
separate sentence. For example, ―John went. Peter went, too.‖ Or it can be expressed in a sentence such as,
―John went, and Peter also.‖1) Reasons for viewing participants individually
        There are several reasons for viewing participants individually.a) Afterthought
     One of the most common reasons for viewing a participant in an action individually is the need for an
     afterthought. That is to say, you may start out by saying, ―John went.‖ Then you remember about Peter
     and add as an afterthought, ―Peter went too.‖b) Separate roles
     A more important reason for viewing a participant in an action individually is that you want your hearer to
     keep sight of the different roles of the characters. An example of this is found in the story, Little Red
     Riding Hood: ―Little Red Riding Hood went on to grandmother‘s house. The wolf went, too.‖
        In this example, there is a desire to keep the role of the heroine separate from the role of the villain.c) Individual actions
      Another reason for viewing the participants of an action separately is that, for some reason, it is important
      to emphasize that the added participant also participated in the action. This may be accomplished in
      English by use of the word ―both‖ or ―all.‖ For example, ―John and Mary both went.‖ or ―Peter, John and
      Mary all went.‖

     Ne, when used as the verb stem, means ‗going to go‘; when it is suffixed to another stem it means ‗going to ___‘.
120                                                                                   Grouping Objects, People, or Actions2) Including an additional participant construction
        In Kuna, to refer to an additional individual participant who also performed the action, a separate sentence
        is used. That sentence restates the participant, and the action, and adds the suffix -mo to the verb referring
        to the action.
Example
       Juan nad. Pedro nanmo.46                  ‗John went. Peter went too.‘        a) Including an additional participant in an attributive sentence
        In the case of an attributive sentence, where no verb is expressed, the suffix -mo attaches to the attribute.
Example
       Pedro orojuli. Juan orojulmo.             ‗Peter is tall. John is tall too.‘        b) Including an additional participant in a conversational exchange
        In conversation, if you wish to include somebody else in the action to which the previous speaker just
        referred, repeat the verb he used and add -mo to it.
Examples
    1. John:             An ne.        ‗I am going to go.‘
    2. Mary:             An nemo.      ‗I am going to go, too.‘10.4.2.2 Participants viewed as a group
At times, it is necessary to group the different participants together and treat them as if they had acted as a unit.
For example, ―John and Mary went.‖
There are at least two constructions for viewing participants as a group. Reference to participants as a group
usually occurs in answer to a question or in making a statement.","[130, 131, 132, 133]"
"19.4 Grammar
19.4.1 Obligation (Ex. 5–6)
Obligation parallels the English construction, ―ought to ...‖ or ―have to ...‖. This concept is expressed by adding
the obligatory suffix -nab to the long form of the verb stem.
Example
       Nuskan e pabgan atakenab.               ‗Children ought to respect their parents.‘
Exercise 5. Obligation frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise may be repeated several times.
Example       Teacher: Ome mas tuenab.
              Student: Ome mas tuenab.
      1. Ome mas tuenab.                       ‗The woman has to cook the food.‘
      2. An nenab.                             ‗I have/ought to go.‘
      3. Pe an pennukenab.                     ‗You have to pay me.‘
      4. Nuskan e pabgan atakenab.             ‗Children ought to respect their parents.‘
      5. Pe anka chogenab.                     ‗You need to tell me.‘
Exercise 6. Obligation stimulus response drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies using the obligation -nab form.
Example       Teacher: ¿Pe ne?
              Student: Antin nenab.
      1. ¿Pe ne?                               ‗Are you going?‘
      2. ¿Pe kai chune?                        ‗Are you going to fetch sugar cane?‘
      3. ¿Pe saglaga chogo?                    ‗Will you tell the chief?‘
      4. ¿Pe neg chomne?                       ‗Are you going to build a house?‘
      5. ¿Pe ina too?                          ‗Will you take (swallow) the medicine (pills)?‘19.4.2 Non-obligatory expressions
Several adverbial expressions may be used to indicate that an action was done without obligation or duress.19.4.2.1 an/pe/a itoleged „my/your/his/hers/its own desire (lit.: feeling)‟
Example    Machi a itoleged nad.      ‗The boy went of his own desire.‘19.4.2.2 pinche „just (without duress or purpose)‟
When used to refer to an action executed without duress it is generally said with a disclaimer intonation (see
6.2.2).
19.4 Grammar                                                                                                   259Example       Machi pinche yogal pakcha. ‗The boy just bought the shirt (on a whim).‘19.4.2.3 naga/aga tukin „of my/one‟s own free will‟
naga/aga tukin ‗of my/one‘s own free will‘ is further discussed in Section 20.4.6.2.
Example
       Punadin aga tukin mol ukcha.           ‗The girl sold the blouse herself (of her own volition).‘19.4.3 Futility
An event or action may be perceived as being done in vain. This concept of futility is expressed by the adverb
pinche ‗in vain/for nothing‘ which, in this usage, normally occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Examples
    1. Pinche an ti.                        ‗I went for nothing.‘
    2. Pinche an ul chobzha.                ‗I might as well have not made the canoe.‘
However, when used as an adverb of futility, pinche occasionally occurs in the adverbial position.
Example       Antin pinche mani amidi.      ‗I went in vain for the money.‘
Pinche can also mean ‗just (for no reason/purpose)‘. Intonation, context and word order provide clues to which
meaning it has.","[271, 272]"
"14.4.6.1 Purpose clause - explanation of action
One type of purpose clause is formed by adding the purposive suffix -gal/-kal to the verb (stem) of the
(purpose) clause. This type of purpose construction is used to give a straightforward explanation of the purpose
or desired goal of the action in the independent sentence. It parallels the English construction, ―He went
shopping to buy shoes.‖ In this construction, the focus is on the independent sentence. The speaker wishes to
express one main idea, but adds the purpose construction to give additional background information. Hence, the
purpose clause does not advance the listener to the next step in the story/explanation/argument, but rather gives
the motive for the main action.
Although a purpose clause may occur in the adverbial position in a sentence, it usually occurs at the end of a
sentence in the postpredicate position (see 17.4.1).
Examples
    1. Machimal ya akinai, ti ariogal.                   ‗The boys are digging a ditch (hole), to let the water
                                                         flow (out).‘
     2a. Nandin mol makcha, manigin ukegal.              ‗Mother sewed a blouse to sell for money.‘
      b. Nandin manigin ukegal mol makcha.               ‗Mother sewed the blouse to sell it for money.‘
When the subject and/or object of the purpose clause is the same as that of the independent sentence, it is not
repeated in the purpose clause.
Example
         An mol pakcha, nanga ukegal.                ‗I bought cloth (for me) to give (it) to Mother.‘
However, if the subject of the main clause becomes the indirect object of the purpose clause, it must be repeated
with the suffix -ga/-ka.
Example
       An ina pakcha, nan anka madu chobgal.            ‗I bought yeast, for Mother to make bread for me.‘14.4.6.2 Purpose clause - event precipitated by action of independent sentence
Another type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be precipitated by the action in the
independent sentence. This clause begins with meke ‗in order that‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added
to the verb.
The purpose clause marked by meke ‗in order to‘ focusses more attention on the purpose than on the main
action. It expresses the desired outcome or result (as yet unfulfilled) of the main action. It is part of the mainline
information and advances the story/explanation/argument another step in the logical progression.
The meke form of a purpose clause almost always occurs in the postpredicate position. Even though the subject
may be the same in both clauses, it must be stated in both clauses.
14.4 Grammar                                                                                                      181Examples
      1. Antin pe pabga mani palmine, meke adin          ‗I am going to send money to your father, in order
           Panamaje taggal.                              that he will come to Panama.‘
      2. Antin immis mani amine, meke an pan             ‗I am going to get money today, so that I can buy
           nabir immal pakegal.                          (some) things tomorrow.‘
In order to understand the change of focus given by the use of the word meke, contrast Example 1 above with
the following sentence, in which the purpose of sending money is explained, rather than focussing on the goal
of having your father come to Panama.
Example
          Antin pe pabga mani palmine, adin               ‗I am going to send money to your father, to/for him
          Panamaje taggal.                                to come to Panama.‘14.4.6.3 Purpose clause - event prevented by independent sentence action
This third type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be averted/prevented by the action
in the independent sentence. This clause begins with the adverb melle ‗don‘t‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal
is added to the verb. This parallels the English construction ―in order not to....‖
Example
       Pe anka chogo, melle an igegal.                 ‗You tell me, in order that I will not forget.‘
Exercise 13. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example      Teacher: Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.
             Student: Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.
     1.   Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.             ‗The chief gave (me) money in order to buy corn.‘
     2.   An ne, immal pakegal.                     ‗I am going, in order to buy something.‘
     3.   Machimal ya kinai, ti ariogal.            ‗The boys are digging a ditch, in order for the water to
                                                    flow (away).‘
     4.   An akan amine, tad ul chobgal.            ‗I am going to look for an axe in order for grandfather
                                                    to make a canoe.‘
     5.   An kal palmis, nudagal.                   ‗I sent the radio, in order to repair it.‘Exercise 14. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal drill
The teacher reads the pair of sentences. The student makes the second sentence into a purpose clause by using
-gal/-kal.
Example       Teacher: Machi kinki pakcha.
              Teacher: Machi immal amine
              Student: Machi kinki pakcha, immal aminegal.

The teacher says the sentence and then says either meke or melle. The student uses the frame to make a
sentence incorporating the sentence said by the teacher as a purpose clause.
Example       Teacher: An ne.
              Teacher: melle
              Student: Pe anka chogo, melle an negal.
      Frame Pe anka chogo: meke/melle ____-gal. ‗Please tell me so that I will/won‘t ____.‘

       2. Machi e urpa pentas.           ‗The boy helped his younger brother.‘
       3. An pega mol ukcha.             ‗I sold the blouse for you.‘
       4. An mas kunne.                  ‗I am going to eat.‘
       5. An machi odurtas.              ‗I punished the boy.‘14.4.6.4 Noun of purpose (implement)
An implement or tool used in performing a certain task or action may be referred to by adding the suffix
-gal/-kal to the verb stem that describes the action itself.
Examples
     1a. turwi                   ‗to sweep‘
      b. turwigal                ‗broom‘
     2a. igmu                    ‗to burrow‘
      b. igmugal                 ‗(type of) hoe (for burrowing in the earth) (Spanish: coa)‘
This device for naming implements cannot be used for all implements. Some forms are unacceptable, and some
are never used. It is very useful, however, in describing a tool foreign to the culture.","[193, 194, 195]"
"13.4.5.1 Sequential conjunction tegin(e) „and then‟
Tegin(e) ‗and then‘ is used to indicate either temporal sequence (one action following another) or logical
sequence (one idea following another).
Examples
       1. Tegin sagla immal aminad.            ‗Then the chief went hunting.‘
       2. Tegin sagla us abingus.              ‗Then (he) met an agouti.‘
       3. Tegin ilgwen imas.                   ‗Then (he) shot once.‘
       4. Mecha.                               ‗(He) killed (it).‘
In the above examples, the speaker viewed the events of the sequence as following one after another in a time
sequence. Each separate event began with the word tegin ‗then‘. The speaker viewed the shooting, Tegin
ilgwen imas, and the killing in the last sentence Mecha, as a single main action, not as a sequence of actions
and, therefore, did not use the conjunction tegin.
The speaker could have chosen to consider the two last actions imas ‗shot‘ and mecha ‗killed‘ as separate and
used the conjunction in the last sentence.
Examples
    1. Tegin sagla immal aminad.             ‗Then the chief went hunting.‘
    2. Tegin sagla us abingus.               ‗Then (he) met an agouti.‘
    3. Tegin ilgwen imas.                    ‗Then (he) shot once.‘
13.4 Grammar                                                                                                     171     4. Tegin tar mecha.                     ‗Then (he) killed it.‘
Tegine, the long form of tegin, tends to be used in adding onto something already said such as in listing.73

       An immal pakcha; aros, palu, tegine kwallu.            ‗I bought some things, rice, salt, and oil.‘13.4.5.2 Variations of tegin(e)1) tegin kep
        Tegin kep ‗then only/only after that‘ is used to make the present event a clear sequel to the previous event,
        that is to say, only after the one event happened did the actor continue with the sequence.
Examples
    1. Antin wis mas kucha.                     ‗I had a (little) bite to eat.‘
    2. Tegin keb an nadbal.                     ‗Only then did I go on again.‘2) tegin and tebal
        Tegin ‗that is where‘ and tebal ‗that is where‘ may be used as locatives to refer back to a narrow or broad
        setting (see 8.4.1) in adverbial clauses of location.
Examples
    1. Machi sae koe mechadgin, tegin an es onos. ‗At the place where the boy killed the deer, is where
                                                  (the exact spot) I found the machete.‘
    2. Pukur igalbal, tebal an ti.                ‗Along the Pucuru trail, that is (more or less) where I
                                                  was.‘3) tegidgin
        The conjunction, tegidgin ‗at the same time‘ is used to indicate simultaneous action.
Examples
    1. Tegin koe tigin arkwasgu, tegidgin an imas. ‗Then as the deer fell into the water, at that moment,
                                                   I fired.‘
    2a. Sagladin, anche ekichis.                   ‗The chief asked me.‘
    b. Tegidgin an nega chogal.                    ‗At that precise moment, I told (the chief) himself.‘13.4.5.3 Change-of-direction marker tenal
Tenal ‗but‘ marks a change in the direction that a sequence of events or ideas are taking or it may mark an
unexpected outcome or response. Thus, it may be used when the expected result is not achieved. It may also be
used to modify a general statement. Tenal ‗but‘ is not used to contrast or indicate one thing as opposite from
another. The contrastive construction uses the suffix -din/-tin (see Appendix E.4).
Examples
    1. Pedro Panamaje nebi tenal adin igal ma               ‗Peter wants to go to Panama but he does not have
         nikchul.                                           permission.‘
    2. An immal paknade, tenal an kwen immal                ‗I went to buy (some) things but I did not buy
         pakchajul.                                         anything.‘
    3a. Koedin igalgin un.                                  ‗The deer was standing on the trail.‘
    b. Tenal antin kwen imachul.                            ‗But I did not shoot.‘
    c. Antin pala saté.                                     ‗I had no bullet.‘73
     See Section 5.4.2.
172                                                                     Communicating Community Togetherness13.4.5.4 Change-of-topic marker te choggudin(a)
Te choggudin(a) ‗then I have something else to say‘ is frequently used in long teaching discourses to mark a
shift from one topic to another.
Examples
    1. ...Nuskandin e pabgandin atakenab.                 ‗...Children ought to respect their parents.‘
    2. Te choggudina Pab Tummaddin anmalga                ‗Then I have something else to say: the Big Father
         igal ebes...                                     left us our traditions...‘13.4.5.5 Result conjunction tegil
Certain situations lead to or make possible a subsequent action. The conjunction tegil ‗so (then)‘ may come
before or after the subsequent action to relate the action to the preceding one.
Examples
      1. Tegil an ne.           ‗So then I am going to go (now).‘
      2. An ne tegil.           ‗I am going to go then.‘
This construction differs from the assertive (emphatic) construction formed by the addition of the suffix -do/-to
(see Appendix E.6).
Example          An nedo.                      ‗I am going to go.‘
It also differs from the consequential action formed by the addition of the consequential suffix
-chun/-zhun/-jun to the verb (see 19.4.5).
Example       An nejun.                       ‗Consequently, I am going to go.‘13.4.5.6 Concessive conjunction yabli
In order to express the concept that in spite of what has/will happen, an event has/will take(n) place, the adverb
yabli ‗in spite of/even though/nevertheless‘ is used. It usually occurs before the subject in a concessive clause
although it may occur after it in the adverbial position in a simple sentence. Yabli may also be used to express
the English concept, ―whether...‖ or ―whether ... happens, still ... (is going to happen).‖
Examples
     1. Yabli an neelen, antin machi pentachulin.        ‗Even though I were to go, I wouldn‘t help the boy.‘
     2. Antin yabli nad.                                 ‗I went nevertheless.‘
     3. Yabli an chunma, yabli an yakir pes,             ‗Whether I talked (or) whether I remained silent, still
           tulemal an kwen ibzhachulmal.                 nobody believed me.‘
Yabli ‗nevertheless‘ is used following tenal ‗but‘ when the event is not expected to occur because of the
adverse circumstances.
Example       Ti winai, tenal yabli an nad. ‗It was raining but nevertheless, I went.‘13.4.5.7 Explanation introducer immidin
Immidin ‗now/now then‘ is used to introduce an explanation.
Example       Immidin pedin wis antin nejuli.          ‗Now (to explain) you know I am not going.‘13.4.5.8 Reason-result construction with ulgin
One event may take place because of another. The reason for action adverb ulgin may be used in a clause of
reason, or to initiate a sentence which is the result of a previous sentence.
The reason clause is marked by using the nominalizer suffix -d/-t with the verb, followed by the word ulgin.
This clause may occur in either the adverbial or postpredicate position.
13.4 Grammar                                                                                                           173Examples
      1. Jaime pe chogzhad ulgin nad.        ‗Jim left/went because of what you said.‘
      2. Jaime nad, pe chogzhad ulgin.       ‗Jim left/went because of what you said.‘
Sometimes the reason is given in one sentence and is followed by a sentence which gives the resultant action.
This second sentence is introduced by either a ulgin ‗because of that‘ or te ulgin ‗because of that very thing‘.
Examples
   1a. Antin ye.                                   ‗I am sick.‘
    b. A ulgin an arpachuli.74                     ‗Because of that, I did not work.‘
   2a. Pe chogzha.                                 ‗You told (it).‘
    b. Te ulgin an nejuli.                         ‗Because of that very thing, I am not going to go.‘1) Extended use of ulgin
        Ulgin ‗because of‘ is also used to express the fault of someone or conversely, in a good sense, ‗by virtue
        of (someone)‘.
Examples
    1. Motordin pe ulgin iskus.                    ‗(It was) your fault that the outboard motor broke.‘
    2. An pe ulgin abonoles.                       ‗I was rescued by/because of you.‘2) Other similar constructions
        There are two other words which contrast with ulgin in some constructions: anal ‗in the place of‘ and
        nuggin ‗by/in the authority of/name of‘. The three are contrasted in the following sentences.
Examples
    1. An poni nikad ulgin purkwene.75          ‗I am going to die because of the disease I have.‘
    2. Pedro an anal neg kweburga immal paknao. ‗Peter will go in my place to buy things for the town.‘
    3. Antin sagla nuggin immal imako.          ‗I will do it by the authority of the chief.‘13.4.5.9 Cause-effect construction ulal
One event may be caused by another. This differs from reason in that the reason may have prompted or influenced
the course of action, but it did not actually cause it or bring it about. Cause is marked by ulal ‗the cause of‘. It
almost always occurs together with the appropriate demonstrative a or te. The cause sentence occurs first. The next
sentence is introduced by a ulal ‗that is why/the cause of‘ or te ulal ‗that is exactly why/the cause of‘.
Examples
   1a. Telefono iskus.                                      ‗The telephone is out of order.‘
    b. A ulal keg an pebak chunma.                          ‗That is why I can‘t talk with you.‘
   2a. Pedin wis chapidin akangin aglas.                    ‗You know (that) the tree fell on the axe.
    b. Te ulal pe anka akan pid pakenab.                    That’s exactly why you have to buy me another one.‘13.4.5.10 Logical outcome
An event may be anticipated and a certain cause of action embarked on accordingly. In expressing this idea, the
anticipated situation is given in one sentence. The subsequent action embarked on is introduced by al ‗this leads/led to‘.
Examples
    1. Pedro pe yartakojob.                        ‗Peter says he is going to deceive/cheat you.‘
    2. Al an iktual pega chogdani.                 ‗This led me to come and tell you beforehand.‘
74
     arpas ‗worked‘ + chuli ‗not‘ = arpachuli ‗did not work‘.

                                  14 SOCIAL INTERACTION
14.1 Dialogue
The early conversation of a casual social call often revolves around what the respective host and guest have
done during the day.
      1.    Visitor:          ¿Pia pe ti?                          ‗Where did you go?‘
      2.    Villager:         Antin, an76 chapurbal ti,            ‗I went to the jungle with my brother-in-law.‘
                              ubbak.
      3.    Visitor:          ¿Ibi chedi?                          ‗What did you do?‘
      4.    Villager:         An ila chwadi, matabake an           ‗I got chonta palm, four of them.‘
                              chwas.
      5.    Visitor:          Teobi. ¿Ibiga?                       ‗Is that so? What are they for?‘
      6.    Villager:         Neg chobgal, ubgad.                  ‗For building a house, my brother-in-law‘s.‘
      7.    Visitor:          Aaaa. ¿Pe immal takcha?              ‗Oh! Did you see anything (wildlife)?‘
      8.    Villager:         Chuli. Pinche chigli takcha,         ‗No, only one turkey.‘
                              kwagwen.
      9.    Visitor:          ¿Makcha?                             ‗Did you kill (it)?‘
      10.   Villager:         Makchado. Tegin tapa                 ‗(Yes), I killed it. Then we saw a bushmaster
                              igalbal maibali.                     (snake) on the trail.‘
      11.   Visitor:          ¿Chunna?                             ‗Really!‘
      12.   Villager:         Eye. Tenal an ub tar mecha,          ‗Yes. But my brother-in-law killed it with a
                              esgin.                               machete.‘

      15.   Visitor:          Ajáj.                                ‗A-hah!‘14.2 Pronunciation (Ex. 1–4)
Visiting is the heart of social interaction. Concentrate on sounding natural by drilling and redrilling
conversational patterns such as those found in Dialogue 14.1. Note the difference between a formal,
laryngealized, nothing-much-happened, disclaiming response (see 16.4.3) intonation and a relaxed, more
intimate, and common intonation.
Exercise 1. Tracking
Track the teacher as he says Dialogue 14.1. Be sure to keep within two or three syllables behind him at all
times. Repeat this exercise several times, concentrating on the common intonation pattern.
Exercise 2. Dramatizing the dialogue
Dramatize Dialogue 14.1 with the student playing the role. The teacher is to check for:
1. correct common intonation patterns,
2. correct pronunciation, and
3. correct gestures.","[183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188]"
"19.4.4.1 Ability in the five senses (innate ability)
The five basic senses are described in Kuna by two verbs: tak ‗to see‘ (atak ‗to look at‘) and ito ‗to
hear/feel/taste/smell‘. The ability to use the senses is expressed by the use of the verb mag ‗to be able to‘ which
usually precedes the verb of sense.
Examples
     1. Machi toto mag take.                  ‗The little boy is able to see.‘
     2. Machi mag atak.                       ‗The boy is able to look at (things).‘
     3. Punadin mag ito.                      ‗The girl can hear/feel/smell/taste.‘
Conversely, innate inability to use the senses is expressed by aku ‗to be unable to‘.
Examples
    1. Punadin aku immal tak.                             ‗The girl is blind (unable to see anything).‘
    2. Machidin aku ito.                                  ‗The boy doesn‘t understand/hear (lit.: unable to
                                                          understand/hear). The boy is deaf.‘
260                                                                                           Kuna Speech Types19.4.4.2 Capacity to perform an action
One may have the capacity to perform an action, but actually carrying it out may depend on the desire of the
actor. To express the capacity to perform an action, the adverb nabir ‗to be able‘ is used before the action verb.
Conversely, the adverb keg ‗to be unable to‘ indicates that the actor has the capacity to perform the action but
for some reason he is unable to do so in a given situation.
Examples
      1. Mimmi nabir nane.                   ‗The little girl can walk.‘
      2. Machi keg pe pentako.               ‗The boy will be unable to help you.‘
Nabir ‗to be able to‘ and keg ‗to be unable to‘ are also used referring to permission: nabir ‗to be
allowed/permitted to‘ or keg ‗to not be allowed/pemitted to‘.
Examples
    1. Machergandin nabir we tak.             ‗The men are allowed to look at that.‘
    2. Omegandin keg we tak; izhe.            ‗The women are not allowed to look at that (it is forbidden).‘19.4.4.3 Learned ability
Where knowledge is a prerequisite for performance, the verb wis ‗to know how to‘ is used. Conversely, wichul
‗to not know how to‘ is used to indicate lack of knowledge. Wis/wichul(i) may be used alone or together with a
verb specifying the skill. The short form of the verb stem specifying the skill is used.
Examples
   1a. ¿Punadin wis mas tu?                            ‗Does the girl know how to cook?‘
    b. ¿Wis, (adin)?                                   ‗(She) knows.‘
   2a. ¿Machidin wis tomoma?                           ‗Does the boy know how to swim?‘
    b. Wichul.                                         ‗(He) does not know how.‘
    3. Taddin wis neg chob.                            ‗The elder knows how to build a house.‘
    4. Machidin wichul kammu ogol.                     ‗The boy doesn’t know how to play the flute.‘
Exercise 7. Ability frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise may be repeated several times.

Certain actions or events result in succeeding event(s) as a consequence of the situation which they bring about.
The succeeding event is introduced in English by the phrase ―and consequently‖. Generally speaking, in Kuna,
the first event is stated in one sentence and the consequential event is stated in the next sentence which begins
with the conjunction tegin ‗and then‘. The consequential suffix -chun/-zhun/-jun111 is added to the verb.
Examples
    1. Sagla maichuli.                                         ‗The chief was not home.‘
    2. Tegin antin kannan negzhe nadzhun.                      ‗Consequently I went back home.‘
Exercise 10. -chun/-zhun/-jun frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise may be repeated several times.
Example         Teacher: An nadzhun.
                Student: An nadzhun.
         1. An nadzhun.                              ‗So I left.‘
         2. Wagi ob machun.                          ‗So the parrots ate the corn.‘
         3. Ome upchan purenaichun.                  ‗So the woman is spinning the cotton.‘
         4. An karta nermanejun.                     ‗So I‘m going to write a letter.‘
         5. An mas kunnejun.                         ‗So I‘m going to eat (some) food.‘
Exercise 11. -chun/-zhun/-jun substitution frame drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it substituting it in the frame.
Example        Teacher: An kannan nadbal.
               Student: An yannu mecha. Tegin an kannan nadbalchun.
       Frame An yannu mecha. Tegin ____-chun. ‗I killed a peccary. So then ____.‘

         5. An chapurbal yannu ebes.                  ‗I left the peccary in the jungle.‘19.4.6 Causative (Ex. 12)
A causative action is one which the subject causes someone else to perform; it parallels the English construction
―to cause (someone) to‖. In Kuna, the causative is formed by adding the causative prefix o- to the verb stem.
Most, although not all, verbs may use the causative prefix. Certain related concepts which in English are
expressed by two separate verbs, are expressed in Kuna by the verb and by the verb plus the causative prefix.
Examples
   1a. turta                          ‗to learn‘
    b. odurta112                      ‗to teach (lit.: to cause to learn)‘
   2a. kun                            ‗to eat‘
    b. okun                           ‗to feed (lit.: to cause to eat)‘
   3a. kob                            ‗to drink‘
    b. ogob113                        ‗to give a drink (lit.: to cause to drink)‘
   4a. Kallen oge.                    ‗Light the lamp./Switch on the light.‘
    b. Kallen okin.                   ‗Put out the lamp./Switch off the light.‘
Exercise 12. o- substitution frame drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it using the causative o- form in the frame.
Example          Teacher: An ti kobo.
                 Student: An machi ti ogobo.
       Frame An machi ____ o-____.            ‗I ____ cause the boy to ____.‘
        1. An ti kobo.          ‗I‘ll drink water.‘
        2. An ua kucha.         ‗I ate fish.‘
        3. An turtane.          ‗I‘m going to learn.‘
        4. An tomomanai.        ‗I am swimming.‘
        5. An nane.             ‗I walk.‘19.4.7 Causative commands
The formation of commands which cause another person to do an action varies according to the type of verb
used.","[272, 273, 274, 275]"
"1) Money unit prefixes used to describe quantities less than one dollar
        Two prefixes used by Darién Kuna for money valued at less than one dollar are mani- ‗five cents/nickel‘
        and ton- ‗fifty cents‘.a) Mani- ‗coin‘
    Mani- ‗five cents/one nickel‘ is the smallest unit of money used for trade in the Darién.30 In describing the
    cost of items valued between five and forty-five cents, the Kunas describe the cost as a multiple of five
    cent pieces. For example, if an item costs twenty-five cents, the Kunas would interpret the cost of the item
    as five five-cent units, or five nickels. The prefix mani- uses two forms of the numeral phrase. If an item
    costs from five to thirty cents (i.e., one to six nickels), the form of the numeral phrase is mani- + basic
    number stem.
        If the item costs from thirty-five to forty-five cents (seven to nine nickels), the form of the number phrase
        is mani- + kwa-31 + basic number stem.
Example
    1. manibake                      ‗20 cents (four five-cent units)‘
    2. maniatal                      ‗25 cents (five, five-cent units)‘
    3. manikwakugle                  ‗35 cents (seven, five-cent units)‘
    4. manikwapabak                  ‗40 cents (eight, five-cent units)‘
Exercise 10. Money unit drill
The teacher writes on the board one of the money quantities listed in the lesson. The teacher then says the Kuna
money unit. The student repeats the money unit after the teacher. This exercise should be repeated several
times.
Examples        Teacher (writes):    5¢
                Teacher (says):      manigwen
                Student (says):      manigwen
                Teacher (writes):    10¢
                Teacher (says):      manibo
                Student (says):      manibo
         1. 5¢          manigwen           ‗five cents‘
         2. 10¢         manibo             ‗ten cents‘
         3. 15¢         manipá             ‗fifteen cents‘
         4. 20¢         manibake           ‗twenty cents‘
         5. 25¢         maniatal           ‗twenty-five cents‘
         6. 30¢         maninerkwa         ‗thirty cents‘
         7. 35¢         manikwakugle       ‗thirty-five cents‘
         8. 40¢         manikwapabak       ‗forty cents‘
         9. 45¢         manikwabakebak     ‗forty-five cents‘
30
     mani kollogwad ‗cent‘ (lit., yellow money) is used only in the city and in larger towns.
31
     kwa- is a Group I shape prefix (see 5.4.1.3).
7.4 Grammar                                                                                                           77b) Ton- ‗fifty cents‘
     Ton- is used to describe units of fifty cents. The most common use of the prefix ton- is in the description
     of an item which costs fifty cents, tongwen. Very occasionally other number stems are added to the prefix
     ton- and are used to describe values which are multiples of fifty cents. The numeral phrase is formed by
     ton- + basic number stem.
Examples
    1. tongwen               ‗fifty cents (one fifty-cent unit)‘
    Rarely used forms include:
      2. tonbo                    ‗one dollar (two fifty-cent units)‘
      3. tonpá                    ‗one dollar, fifty (three fifty-cent units)‘
      4. tonbake                  ‗two dollars (four fifty-cent units)‘2) Money unit terms used to describe quantities of one dollar or more
     Two terms used by the Kuna in the Darién to describe money valued at more than one dollar are karta
     ‗dollar bill‘ and olmani- ‗gold sovereign‘.
     Karta ‗dollar bill‘ is the word used to describe dollar bills in Kuna. It actually means ‗paper/book‘. The
     form used to describe the denomination of a dollar bill or the price of an item is karta + ka- (or mata-32) +
     basic number stem.
     Although either ka- or mata- may be used in the numeral phrase, ka- is more common. The word karta is
     usually used to describe denominations of money valued at less than ten dollars. However, this is not
     always the case. When the term karta is used to describe denominations of twenty or more, the Group I
     prefixes, ka- and mata- are not usually used.
Examples
     1. karta kagwen           ‗one dollar‘33
        or
        karta matagwen
     2. karta kabo             ‗two dollars‘
        or
        karta matabo
     3. karta katulabo         ‗forty dollars‘
        or
        karta matatulabo
        or
        karta tulabo
    Olmani- ‗gold sovereign dollar bills‘ is another money unit prefix. The form used to describe the
    denomination of a bill or the price of an item is olmani- + basic number stem.
     This prefix is usually used to describe denominations of more than ten dollars, although occasionally one
     dollar amounts are described by this prefix.
32
  ka- and mata- are Group I shape prefixes (see 5.4.1.3).
33
  Sometimes the loan word balboa or dólar is used in the place of karta. If an item was purchased in Colombia, the word
peso might be used.

    1. olmanigwen/olmanigwenchak              ‗one dollar‘
    2. olmaniambe                             ‗ten dollars‘
    3. olmanitulagwen kakaambe                ‗thirty dollars‘
Exercise 11. Drilling numerals substitution frame drill
Using the frame, the teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it. Then the teacher and student say
Sentence 1 in unison. The teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it. Then the teacher and student say
Sentence 2 in unison, etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Examples       Teacher:                             karta kagwen
               Student:                             karta kagwen
               Teacher and Student (in unison):     karta kagwen

               Student:                             karta kabo
               Teacher and Student (in unison):     karta kabo
      1. karta kagwen          ‗one dollar‘
      2. karta kabo            ‗two dollars‘
      3. karta kapá            ‗three dollars‘
      4. karta kabake          ‗four dollars‘

      8. karta kapabak         ‗eight dollars‘
      9. karta kabakebak       ‗nine dollars‘
     10. karta kaambe          ‗ten dollars‘
Exercise 12. Numeral agreement substitution frame drill
Using the frame, the teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the
student repeats it, etc. The teacher and the student say the succeeding sentences in unison.
Example        Teacher:                             karta kaambe kakagwenchak
               Student:                             karta kaambe kakagwenchak
               Teacher:                             karta kaambe kakabo
               Student:                             karta kaambe kakabo
               Teacher and Student (in unison):     karta kaambe kakapá
      1. karta kaambe kakagwenchak                      ‗eleven dollars‘
      2. karta kaambe kakabo                            ‗twelve dollars‘
      3. karta kaambe kakapá                            ‗thirteen dollars‘
      4. karta kaambe kakabake                          ‗fourteen dollars‘
      5. karta kaambe kakaatal                          ‗fifteen dollars‘
      6. karta kaambe kakanerkwa                        ‗sixteen dollars‘
      7. karta kaambe kakakugle                         ‗seventeen dollars‘
      8. karta kaambe kakapabak                         ‗eighteen dollars‘
      9. karta kaambe kakabakebak                       ‗nineteen dollars‘3) Complex amounts in money phrases
     The description of a price may require one, two or three of the money unit categories, mani ‗five-cent
     unit‘, ton- ‗fifty-cent unit‘, and/or karta/olmani- ‗dollar bills‘. The conjunction eg ‗and/in addition to‘ is
     used to join the parts of a complex money phrase.
7.4 Grammar                                                                                                       79Example
       karta              kapá              eg                   tongwen          eg               maniatal
       dollars            three             and                  fifty-cents      and              five-nickels
       ‗three dollars and seventy-five cents‘
     Eg ‗and‘ may be omitted from the number phrase. Following are suggestions for the inclusion or omission
     of eg ‗and‘ in the complex money phrase.
     Use eg ‗and‘ with complex dollar quantities. If the dollar quantity is a number from 11–19 or not a
     multiple of ten, eg ‗and‘ is used before the unit of cents.
Examples
     1. karta katulagwen kakabo eg tongwen              ‗$22.50‘
     2. karta kaambe kakapá eg maniatal                 ‗$13.25‘
     3. karta tulagwen tongwen                          ‗$20.50‘
     4. karta katulagwen kakaambe eg maninerkwa         ‗$30.30‘
     5. karta tulapá tongwen                            ‗$60.50‘
    Use eg ‗and‘ in a three-category money phrase. A money phrase which includes three categories of money
    units (mani-, ton- and karta/olmani-) separates the mani- from the ton- category by the use of eg ‗and‘.
Examples
     1. karta kabo, tongwen eg manipá                   ‗$2.65‘
     2. karta katulapá kakabake tongwen eg manibo       ‗$64.60‘
    Eg ‗and‘ is seldom used in a two-part money phrase. A money phrase which includes only two categories
    of money units (mani- + ton- or karta + ton- or karta + mani-) tends not to use the conjunction eg ‗and‘.
Examples
     1. karta kabo, tongwen                     ‗$2.50‘
     2. tongwen manibake                        ‗$ .70‘
    Use eg ‗and‘ in the case of hesitancy. Eg ‗and‘ is used in a money phrase in which the speaker hesitates as
    he tries to recall the particular quantity. In this circumstance, eg ‗and‘ may be used between any of the
    parts of the money phrase.
Examples
    1. karta kagwen eg ... manibo                      ‗$2.10/$2.00 and ... 10¢‘
    2. karta tulagwen eg ... tongwen eg manipá         ‗$20.65/$20.00 and ... 65¢'
    3. tongwen eg ... maniatal                         ‗75¢/50¢ and ... 25¢‘4) Unit price phrase
     In buying and selling, a useful expression is the cost of a single item, the unit price. The unit price phrase
     in Kuna is expressed by saying the appropriate number prefix + -gwen ‗one‘ + the cost of the item.
Examples
     1. ka- + -gwen, manibo                kagwen, manibo                       ‗one for 10¢‘
     2. ko- + -gwen, karta kabo            kogwen, karta kabo                   ‗one length for $2.00‘
    It is common to use out-of-culture measurement units (see 7.4.1.1) in describing unit prices.
Examples
    1. yartagwen, karta kabo eg tongwen                ‗one yard for $2.50‘
    2. liberatal, karta kagwen                         ‗five pounds for $1.00‘
80                                                                                              Buying and SellingExercise 13. Money units frame drill

"18.4 Grammar
18.4.1 Nominalization (Ex. 4–5)
Verbs may be nominalized by the addition of the suffix -d.
Examples
   1a. kob                                    ‗to drink‘
    b. kobed                                  ‗a drink/something to drink‘
   2a. namake                                 ‗to sing/chant‘
    b. namaked                                ‗a song/chant/something sung or chanted‘
   3a. Sagla tulemal namaked wis.             ‗The chief knows the Kuna chants.‘18.4.1.1 Use of nominalized forms
A nominalized form of a verb may be used as a noun. The examples above parallel the English construction,
―something to (verb).‖ It may also be used to refer to a person/animal who is doing the verb which is used. This
parallels the English construction, ―the person/animal who is (verb)-ing.‖
Examples
      1. kukualed onaned                    ‗pilot (lit.: the person who is causing the airplane to go)‘
      2. arpamalad                          ‗workers (lit.: the people who are working)‘
      3. immal taked                        ‗manager (lit.: the person who is watching (it))‘
      4. achu neg taked                     ‗watch dog‘
A nominalized verb may also be used in a construction which parallels the English relative clause in the
sentence, ―The boy who cut his hand, is the one I saw.‖ In the Kuna phrase chunkal chiked ‗who cut his
hand‘, the nominalized form of the verb chik ‗to cut‘ is used as a relative clause.
Examples
    1. Machi chiklejad nad.                   ‗The boy who had been cut went.‘
    2. Machi nono kochad arpanai.             ‗The boy who hit his head is working.‘

Any noun suffixes may be added to the nominalized verb form.
Examples
    1. An ul nudajadgin nad.                      ‗I went in the canoe which had been repaired.‘
    2. An tule sae nonikidbak nad.                ‗I went with the person who arrived yesterday.‘

  Larson, Donald N. and Smalley, William A. (1972). Becoming Bilingual, A Guide To Language Learning. New Canaan,
Connecticut. Practical Anthropology, pp. 147–150.
310                                                                                                  Language Learninga. Reason
This forces you to do several things:
1. Use what you know of the language.
2. Expand the areas of language that you need most.
3. Decrease the use of the national language, which helps you to start ―thinking‖ in Kuna.
4. Usage helps the words and patterns you employ to become more automatic.b. Problem
Speaking only Kuna will increase cultural stress.137 It is important to note that cultural stress is different from
culture shock inasmuch as it affects everybody who lives in a culture other than their own. The frustration of
trying to communicate in a language you do not control increases your stress load. This is especially true in the
early days but will decrease as your ability to speak Kuna increases. In addition, moving around in a minefield
of unknown cultural booby traps in the form of gestures, attitudes and nuances of spoken clues, is also very
stressful. You should be aware of how to recognize and deal with this problem. There is much written on this
subject which would be of help. In light of this problem. the rule of ―speak Kuna and only Kuna‖ should be
modified.
For instance, depending upon your intended length of stay, stress tolerance, etc., ―only Kuna‖ might have to be
modified to ―only Kuna for X number of hours per day.‖ Preferably you should state when this should be, e.g.,
12:00 noon - 8:00 p.m. (the busy visiting time). It will take discipline even to do this, but the effort will be
worth it. Cultural relaxation, such as light reading or music is good after the end of the designated period for
speaking.c. Setting the limit on speaking only Kuna
There are three ways in which you can limit (modify) the rule of ―speak only Kuna, always.‖ Again, you need
to remember that you are looking for the minimum number of exceptions to this rule that will allow you to
work and live within your limitations (of your stress load, etc.).","[322, 323]"
"5. Conclusion
The suffix -do/-to indicates the conclusion (resolution) of a conversation and is equivalent to the English
expression, ―Let‘s go, then.‖ or to the Spanish expression, ―Vamos pues.‖
                                                       295
296                                                                                       Topics of ConversationExample       Nemaldo.                       ‗Let‘s go, then.‘6. Affirmation
The suffix -do/-to is also used to affirm something.
Example       An wichuldo.                   ‗I do not know.‘7. Word order
The normal word order in Kuna is subject + object + predicate.
Example        Omedin we mol pakcha.           ‗The woman bought that blouse.‘
―The woman‖ in the above example is not only the subject of the sentence, but also the topic of the conversation
as indicated by the topic-establishing suffix -din.
In another situation, it might be the blouse which is under discussion, and the speaker merely comments on the
fact that the woman bought it. In that case, the topic of conversation is the blouse and a Kuna speaker would
change the word order of the sentence by putting the topic (the blouse) first; i.e., topic (object) + subject +
predicate.
The topic is always first in a Kuna sentence (following any setting or conjunction), and usually occurs with a
topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin.
Example
          We moldin, ome pakcha.                           ‗That blouse was bought by the woman. (Lit.: As for
                                                           the blouse, the woman bought (it).)‘
In summary, it may be said that when the subject of the sentence is not the topic of conversation, the normal
word order is rearranged and the topic is positioned at the beginning of the main part of the sentence.
            APPENDIX F: FURTHER NOTES ON -BAL/-PAL
When the suffix - bal/-pal is used in conjunction with the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi, the order of the suffixes
varies according to the significance of the utterance. That is to say, the order of suffixes varies according to the
focus of the desire.","[308, 309, 310]"
"
50
  Nanu is an exception; it is an alternative long form for the word nana ‗mother‘, which is used only as a vocative to
express very intense emotion.
10.4 Grammar                                                                                                        125Example         An ne, tada.              ‗I am going, sir.‘
Long and short forms of words may be used as a vocative. Long forms usually indicate intense emotion such as
fear, frustration, or anger.
Example      ¡Paba, an tobe!              ‗Father, I‘m frightened!‘
When employing a vocative, it is more common to use the role, status, or kinship term for a person, than his
proper name.
Example        Yai, an ne.                      ‗Older brother, I am going.‘10.4.7 Indirect object (Ex. 14)
The indirect object in Kuna functions in approximately the same way that it does in English. For example, ―I
gave the ball to the boy‖ specifies the person to whom the ball was given as the boy (indirect object).
In Kuna, the indirect object usually occurs after the subject and before the direct object and verb in transitive
sentences, or before a verb of ―saying.‖ It is marked by the addition of the suffix -ga/-ka to the noun, proper
name or pronoun.
Examples
      1. An pega mol ukcha.                      ‗I gave the blouse to you.‘
      2. An machiga chogzha.                     ‗I said (it) to the boy.‘
If, however, the indirect object is in focus, it occurs after the verb.
Examples
    1. An mol ukcha, pega.                      ‗I gave the cloth to you.‘
    2. An chogzha, machiga.                     ‗(I said (it) to the boy. (I told the boy.)‘
Exercise 14. Indirect object substitution frame drill
The teacher repeats the frame. The teacher selects a word from the list below that can be substituted in the
frame and says it. The student then substitutes the word in the correct place in the frame.
Example        Teacher: An pega chegar ukcha.
               Teacher: ai
               Student: An aiga chegar ukcha.
    Frame      An ____-ga/-ka chegar ukcha. ‗I gave matches to ____.‘
     1. pe             ‗you‘
     2. pab            ‗father‘
     3. nan            ‗mother‘
     4. mu             ‗grandmother/respected older lady‘
     5. tad            ‗grandfather/respected older man‘
     6. ai             ‗friend‘10.4.8 Affected (interested) object
A common usage of the suffix -ga/-ka is in a situation that affects the present speaker in a similar way to which
it affected the original speaker. For example, when the original speaker says things are going well with him, the
present speaker may say, ―It is going well with me, too.‖
Example          Nuedmoga.                      ‗It is going well with me, too.‘
If the effect is to occur in the future, the -moga becomes -mogo.
Example        Nuedmogo.                        ‗It will go well with me, too.‘
126                                                                                    Grouping Objects, People, or Actions10.4.9 Habitual aspect51 (Ex. 15–16)
Certain events that we speak of happen regularly; they are habits, or customary. ―Tigers eat deer.‖ is an example
of an habitual action. The event of a tiger eating deer is not a one-time event, but rather something that happens
all the time, habitually. In English, the present tense of the verb is used to describe habitual actions. In Kuna,
the short form of the verb stem is used alone without any suffix.
Example           Achu parpad koe kun.               ‗Tigers eat (habitually) deer.‘
Exercise 15. Habitual aspect frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it.
This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example          Teacher: Tule ua kun.
                 Student: Tule ua kun.
         1. Tule ua kun.                             ‗Kunas eat fish.‘
         2. An ina che.                              ‗I practice medicine.‘
         3. An mol pak.                              ‗I (always) buy blouses.‘
         4. An nugal unke.                           ‗I (always) pull teeth.‘
         5. An ome mol mak.                          ‗My wife (always) sews blouses.‘
Exercise 16. Habitual aspect drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student changes it to the habitual aspect form of the verb and adds the word
pane-pane ‗everyday‘.52
Example          Teacher: Machi ua kucha.
                 Student: Machi pane-pane ua kun.
         1. Machi ua kucha.                 ‗The boy ate the fish.‘
         2. Tad ua chwas.                   ‗The elder caught fish.‘
         3. Pun mol enukcha.                ‗The girl washed the clothes.‘
         4. Mu mol makne.                   ‗The old lady is going to sew a blouse.‘
         5. Ome mas tus.                    ‗The woman cooked food.‘10.4.10 Adverbs (Ex. 17–18)
Adverbs in Kuna, as in English, modify the verb; but their position in the sentence is different from English
word order. In Kuna, they occur after the subject and before the indirect or direct object: subject + adverb +
indirect object + direct object + verb.
Subtle nuances of meaning are achieved by changing this basic word order and are discussed in later lessons.
Example
       Pab pirkin machi pilal.                       ‗The father loves the boy very much.‘

      6. e              ‗his/her/its/their‘13.4.2.2 Possessive suffix -gad/-kad in an equative sentence
Possession in an equative sentence is expressed by saying the object possessed, followed by the noun or
pronoun that refers to the possessor to which the possessive suffix -gad/-kad is attached.
Examples
      1. Achu ankad.          ‗The dog is mine.‘
      2. Achu pabgad.         ‗The dog is father’s.‘

A possessive phrase paralleling the English construction ―____ of mine/yours/his/its‖ can be formed by stating
the object possessed, followed by the noun or pronoun that refers to the possessor to which the possessive suffix
-gad/-kad is attached.64
Examples
    1. Es ankad neggin mai.                      ‗A machete of mine is in the house.‘
    2. An karta Pedrogad takcha.                 ‗I saw the book of Peter’s.‘13.4.2.4 Possessive questions
Questions of possession are formed by adding the possessive suffix -gad/-kad to a question word.
Examples
    1. ¿Toagad?                   ‗Whose (is it)?‘
    2. ¿Ibigad?                   ‗To what (does it belong?‘13.4.2.5 Extended use of -gad/-kad

  The variation in word order in which the possessive -gad/-kad form precedes the noun indicates that the focus is on the
possessive word. For example, Ankad ul cheles. ‗(It was) my canoe that was washed away.‘ but Ul ankad cheles. ‗My
canoe was washed away.‘

In Kuna, there is not necessarily anything in a noun or in most verbs which would tell you whether it is singular
or plural. Generally speaking, you understand that a noun/verb is singular or plural from the context of the
sentence or from the situation.
In the case of nouns, however, there are two suffixes, -gan(a)/-kan(a) and -mal(a), which are added in certain
situations to indicate that the speaker is referring to more than one individual.
Positional verbs have a plural form and the suffix -mal(a) may be added to a verb to indicate that ―everyone‖ is
included in an action.","[173, 174, 175]"
"2.4 Grammar
2.4.1 Word order (Ex. 29–30)
Most languages allow for some variation in the normal word order for specific reasons. In Kuna, the normal
word order is different from Spanish or English. Normal word order in the transitive sentence is subject, object,
predicate.
Example
       Subject            Object              Predicate
       An                 ogob                kumpi.
       I                  coconut             eat-want-to
       ‗I want to eat coconut.‘
Exercise 29. Word order -- object substitution drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it. The teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc.
This exercise should be repeated several times.

             Teacher: An nuzha pakpi.
             Student: An nuzha pakpi.
     1. An kallin pakpi.                      ‗I want to buy a chicken.‘
     2. An nuzha pakpi.                       ‗I want to buy eggs.‘
     3. An mol pakpi.                         ‗I want to buy cloth.‘
     4. An kachi pakpi.                       ‗I want to buy a hammock.‘
     5. An ogob pakpi.                        ‗I want to buy coconuts.‘
     6. An mas kumpi.                         ‗I want to eat plantains.‘
     7. An ua kumpi.                          ‗I want to eat fish.‘
     8. An chan kumpi.                        ‗I want to eat meat.‘
     9. An mam kumpi.                         ‗I want to eat manioc.‘
    10. An aswe kumpi.                        ‗I want to eat an avocado.‘
Note 1: Phonological Changes
In forming words, it is important to realize that if certain consonants occur before certain other consonants, the
first consonant changes: n (nn: see section 2.2.6) becomes m if it occurs before p.
Example      kun + -pi = kumpi                ‗want to eat‘
Note 2: Concept of Plural
In Spanish and English, in most cases, the speaker must distinguish between singular and plural, e.g., the
speaker must choose between boy and boys, egg and eggs, etc. In Kuna, this is not so. The speaker does not
need to distinguish (and generally does not distinguish) between singular and plural. The concept of plural and
the means of distinguishing plural from singular is dealt with in Lesson 13.4.3.
Exercise 30. Direct object substitution drill
The teacher repeats the frame and then says any word from the list below. The student then substitutes the word

Desires can be divided into two areas. One either wants to do something (desiderative action) or wants to have
something (desiderative state).","[32, 33, 34]"
"1) Avoiding ambiguity
        Sometimes a speaker, in the process of saying a sentence, will realize that his meaning has been obscure,
        and he will add a word following the predicate to avoid ambiguity or to clarify the intended meaning.
Example              An ul pei; ul kinnigwad.    ‗I want the canoe; the red canoe.‘2) Afterthought
        Occasionally, a speaker will add information in this position as an afterthought. Such a thought is
        sometimes added to forestall an expected objection by the listener, by clarifying the intended meaning.
Example
              Kujal, an pe pennuko ... chedo, itos.         ‗Later I will pay you back; ... (pause) ... this
                                                            afternoon, you understand.‘

      At other times, the postpredicate position is used to fill in information after the speaker pauses because he
      has momentarily forgotten or omitted an item. In such instances, a generic (non-specific) term may occur
      in the main sentence and a specific term after the predicate.
Example
    1. ¿Toa nad?                                   ‗Who went?‘
    2. ... Iwen nad; ... m-mmm Pedro.              ‗(Thinking) So-n-so went; ... m-mmm Peter.‘
Exercise 4. Postpredicate position intonation drill
Stage 1 - Mimicking
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student hums the tune; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student hums
the tune, etc.
Stage 2 - Tracking
The student tracks the teacher as he says Sentence 1; the student tracks the teacher as he says Sentence 2, etc.
Stage 3 - Frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc.
Example        Teacher: Tule noni; tule walapá.
               Student: Tule noni; tule walapá.
       1. Tule noni; tule walapá.           ‗Three people arrived.‘
       2. Machi ne; immal amine.            ‗The boy is going to hunt.‘
       3. Ul noni; ul tummadi.              ‗The big canoe arrived.‘
       4. Anka chogbalo; pinna.             ‗Tell me again slowly.‘
       5. Machi mol ukcha; nanga.           ‗The boy gave the cloth to (his) mother.‘17.4.2 Guidelines for placing elements in the postpredicate position (Ex. 5–28)
For purposes of discussion, the elements of the simple sentence are divided into two classes: basic and
peripheral. Basic elements are the subject, the direct object (in transitive sentences), and the predicate. All other
elements of the simple sentence are peripheral: indirect object; locative, goal and time words and phrases; and
adjectives and adverbs.105
The guidelines for placing both peripheral and basic elements in the postpredicate position are similar. Those
for placing peripheral elements there tend to be more general, however, and are, therefore, dealt with before the
more specific ones for basic elements. If the same guideline applies to a basic element, it is included in this
section. Guidelines specific to basic elements are discussed in Lesson XVIII.D.5. When a peripheral element is
to be placed in the postpredicate position for purposes of highlighting or clarifying, it may be handled in one of
four ways.","[244, 245]"

      Frame Chuli. An pato ____ ti.         ‗No. I have already been to the ____.‘
       1. ¿Pe chapurbal ne?                 ‗Are you going to go to the jungle?‘
       2. ¿Pe negzhe ne?                    ‗Are you going to go home?‘

       4. ¿Pe mas kunne?                    ‗Are you going to eat (some) food?‘
       5. ¿Pe immal amine?                  ‗Are you going to go hunting?‘18.4.3 Gerundial verb form (Ex. 7)
The gerund in English is formed by adding the ending -ing to the verb stem, whereas in Kuna it is composed of
the long form of the verb stem, that is to say, the verb stem which has the -e. There is no tense aspect suffix in
the Kuna gerund.
The gerund is able to act like a noun, for example, ―The doing of it is difficult.‖ In Kuna, as in English, the
gerund focuses on the type of action, versus the doing of the action. Take for example the two phrases, ―to plant
rice‖ and ―rice planting‖. The first phrase tends to focus on the doing of the action, whereas the second phrase
tends to focus on the act itself.
Examples
      1. An cho chike.           ‗I have been firewood cutting.‘
         but
      2. An cho chikti.          ‗I have been to cut firewood.‘
Following are illustrations of the lack of time aspect suffix:
Examples
   1a. ¿Pia pe ne?              ‗Where are you going?‘
    b. Mas chike.               ‗Plantain cutting.‘
   2a. ¿Ibi chenai?             ‗What are you doing?‘
    b. Mas chike.               ‗Plantain cutting.‘
   3a. ¿Pia pe ti?              ‗Where have you been?‘
    b. Mas chike.               ‗Plantain cutting.‘
Exercise 7. Gerund stimulus-response drill
The teacher asks one of the three questions listed below and then selects one of the verbs listed below and says
it. The student replies to the teacher‘s question using the gerund, i.e., -e form of the verb in the frame. This
exercise should be repeated several times, changing the frame to some other suitable one.
Example         Teacher: ¿Pia pe ne?
                Teacher: chik

      9. enuk          ‗to wash‘
     10. chu           ‗to fetch/take‘18.4.4 Qualitative suffix -gwa/-kwa
The qualitative suffix -gwa/-kwa is used to identify/describe an object by its nature/quality and parallels the
English construction ‗a ____ one‘. This suffix may be added to some nouns and many adjectives; one must
learn which forms are acceptable and which are not, since there are no general rules.
Examples
       1. We omegwa e mimmi akwe.                   ‗A female (one) cares for the young.‘
       2. Machi orokwagwa.                          ‗The boy is (a) short (one).‘
The suffix -d(i) may be added to the -gwa/-kwa form of a word and has the effect of the definite English article
―the‖.
Examples
    1. Antin omegwad(i) pakcha.                         ‗I bought the female (of a pair).‘
    2. Pe anka es orokwagwad(i) uko.                    ‗Please give me the short machete.‘18.4.5 Postpredicate position of basic elements (Ex. 8–20)
In Lesson XVII, general guidelines for using the postpredicate position were discussed. In this lesson,
guidelines specific to the basic elements of the sentence -- subject, direct object, and predicate -- are discussed.","[260, 261, 262]"
"14.4.8.1 Instrument suffix -gin/-kin
An object such as an implement or tool is often used to carry out an action. This tool is called the instrument. In
English, the instrument occurs with the preposition ―with‖, the same preposition as used to indicate
accompaniment (see 14.4.7). For example, ―I ate rice with (by means of) a fork.‖ and ―I ate rice with
(accompanied by) my wife.‖ In Kuna, however, the instrument is marked by the suffix -gin/-kin added to the
noun, or to the last member of the instrumental noun phrase (see 9.4.1.2). The instrument is placed in the
adverbial position or just after it.
Examples
       1. Machi eswalgin nakpe mecha.                      ‗The boy killed the snake with a spear.‘
       2. Machi es tummadgin nakpe mecha.                  ‗The boy killed the snake with a big machete.‘
       3. Machi kueye-kueye eswalgin nakpe mecha.          ‗The boy quickly killed the snake with a spear.‘
In some cases, the use of the instrument suffix -gin/-kin parallels more closely the English construction ―by
____‖ or ―for ____.‖ Vehicles of transportation and the medium of exchange/purchase are generally considered
as instruments.
Examples
    1. Machi ulgin ne.                        ‗The boy is going by (in a) car.‘
    2. Juan kukualedgin noni.                 ‗John arrived by (in the) plane.‘
    3. An manigin es pakcha.                  ‗I bought the machete with (for) money.‘

The description of an action may be modified by referring to the method used to perform the action. In this case,
the method refers to one means of doing an action as opposed to any other means. For example, a person may
arrive ―by plane‖ as opposed to ―by car‖ or ―by ship‖. The means usually parallels the English construction ―by
(means of) ____‖ and is formed by adding -bal/-pal80 to the instrument noun.","[197, 198]"
"      2) From their viewpoint
      1. They don‘t wish to embarrass or discourage you.
      2. They get tired of correcting the same thing.
      3. They forget that you really want them to correct you. So, you need to constantly remind your friends to
         help you by correcting you.b. Try to make full use of your knowledge
1. Consciously try to make use of your full repertoire of grammatical constructions.
2. Try to make full use of your vocabulary on a given topic.
3. As you progress in the language, try to be more expressive. Try to bring out the emphasis and focus you
   want to get across to your listener. Learn to be more graphic in your description of exciting events.c. Keep going
If you start to speak on something and you run into trouble, e.g., you‘ve forgotten a vocabulary item, you run
into a situation where you don‘t know what the grammatical structure is, don‘t give up without a fight. Try one
or several of the following:
1. Try to receive prompting by using iwen ... iwen (see Section 11.4.4.1).
2. Admit to a poor memory: ¡Aai! An igija. ‗Oh dear! I forget.‘
3. Try the error technique (see Appendix N).
4. Try a descriptive phrase or sentence instead of a word.
5. Try dramatization, if practical.
Above all, be able to laugh at yourself and at your mistakes. It is much more fun that way, and besides, you will
provide a lot of local entertainment.d. Evaluate yourself
Think about your trouble spots. These may be areas where you get ―stuck‖ or even areas where you are
constantly corrected. This is a good indication that here is an area that you need a lot, yet don‘t control. It makes
good sense to make such an area the next one that you find out about and learn.",[329]

   expanded form in the postpredicate position
      The predicate may be stated in the minimum form of a motion verb (see 16.4.1), ne ‗to go‘ or tag ‗to
      come‘ in the main part of the sentence and expanded by either stating the object and other verb suffixed by
      a motion verb or by stating the object and the gerundial form of another motion verb.
      The predicate cannot be omitted from the main part of the sentence and occur only in the postpredicate
      position of the sentence. Furthermore, this is the only situation in which the direct object is omitted from
      the main part of the sentence. This construction emphasizes the purpose of the motion.

   adverb or goal of action with or without the verb in the postpredicate position
     The predicate may be highlighted/clarified by stating any verb in the main clause and by stating only an
     adverb in the postpredicate position. It may also be clarified by stating an adverb or goal of motion and
     repeating the verb in the postpredicate position. Note carefully that verbs which occur in the main clause
     using -bal/-pal or -mo cannot be highlighted/clarified in this way.
Examples

  Time expressions occasionally occur after the subject or at the end of the sentence, as discussed in 12.4.1.a.3, both in b)
and c).
12.4 Grammar                                                                                                      1431) Past time reference
        When the event to which the speaker is referring happened before the time of his speech, it has a past time
        reference. The past time reference can be expressed by the use of (simple) adverbs of time, or by the
        formation of complex time words. In independent simple sentences, the completive suffix -cha/-zha/-s/-ja
        usually occurs on verbs with a past time reference.a) Use of (simple) adverbs of time
     In Kuna, adverbs of time can be used to express time periods from the immediate past, immis-immis ‗just
     now‘ to asto ‗the day before yesterday‘; or they can be used to express more general past, times such as
     mutik ‗at night‘.
Examples
    1. Immis-immis an chunkal chikcha.                         ‗Just now I cut my hand.‘
    2. Sae an mol makcha.                                      ‗Yesterday I sewed a blouse.‘
    3. Asto an ua chwanad.                                     ‗The day before yesterday I went fishing.‘        b) Forming complex time words
        Specific concepts that are further into the past than ―the day before yesterday‖ are formed by attaching an
        adverb of time (iba ‗day‘, tummi ‗week‘, ni ‗month‘, pirka ‗year‘) to a number suffix and the suffix
        -gus/-kus:54 adverb of time + number suffix + -gus/-kus.
Examples
    1. iba                 + pá           + -gus = ibapagus                        ‗three days ago‘
       day                 three
    2. pirka               + gwen         + -gus = pirkagwengus                    ‗one year ago‘

Exercise 6. Time setting in the past, stimulus-response drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies. The teacher repeats the question and the student replies
with an earlier setting. This drill may be repeated using other questions listed below.
Examples      Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?
              Student: Immis.         ‗today‘
              Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?
              Student: Sae.           ‗yesterday‘
              Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?
              Student: Asto.          ‗day before yesterday‘
              Teacher: ¿Inkwa noni?
              Student: Ibapagus. ‗three days ago‘
The teacher should tell the student when to change from iba ‗day‘ to tummi ‗week‘ or to ni ‗month‘ or pirka
‗year‘.
         1. ¿Inkwa noni?                           ‗When did (you) arrive?‘
         2. ¿Inkwa nade?                           ‗When did (you) leave (here)?‘

        When the event to which the speaker is referring will take place after the time of his speech, it has a future
        time reference. The future time reference may be expressed by the use of adverbs of time, or by the
        formation of complex future time words.a) Use of adverbs of time
     In Kuna, temporal adverbs are used to express time in the immediate future, immis-immis ‗just now‘56
     kujal ‗later‘, and as far into the future as achul ‗day after tomorrow‘ or they may be used to express more
     general future times such as ibegwenche ‗until some day‘.
Examples
    1. Kujal an mas kunne.                         ‗Later, I am going to eat.‘
    2. Pan an mol makne.                           ‗Tomorrow, I am going to sew a blouse.‘
    3. Achul machi ua chwane.                      ‗The day after tomorrow the boy is going to go fishing.‘
56
     The word immis-immis ‗just now‘ may refer to either past or future events, depending upon the form of the verb.

     Time concepts that are further in the future than ―the day after tomorrow‖ may be expressed by attaching
     an adverb of time (iba ‗day‘, tummi ‗week‘, ni ‗month‘, or pirka ‗year‘), a number suffix and the suffix
     -che/-zhe/-je:57 adverb of time + number suffix + -che/-zhe/-je:
Examples
    1. iba                  + nerkwa       + -je = ibanerkwaje                     ‗in six days‘
       day                  six
    2. tummi                + pabak        + -che = tummipabakche                  ‗in eight weeks‘
       week                 eight
    3. pirka                + atal         + -zhe = pirkaatalzhe                   ‗in five years‘
       year                 five
Exercise 7. Time setting in future frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example          Teacher: Pan an ne.
                 Student: Pan an ne.
         1. Pan an ne.                               ‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to go.‘
         2. Pan an karpa chomne.                     ‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         3. Pan an immal amine.                      ‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to go hunting.‘
         4. Achul an ne.                             ‗Day after tomorrow, I‘m going to go.‘
         5. Achul an karpa chomne.                   ‗Day after tomorrow, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         6. Achul an immal amine.                    ‗Day after tomorrow, I‘m going to go hunting.‘
         7. Kujal an ne.                             ‗Later, I‘m going to go.‘
         8. Kujal an karpa chomne.                   ‗Later, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         9. Kujal an immal amine.                    ‗Later, I‘m going to go hunting.‘
        10. Chedo an immal amine.                    ‗At dusk, I‘m going to go hunting.‘
Exercise 8. Time setting in the future stimulus-response drill
The teacher asks the question and the student replies. The teacher repeats the question and the student replies
with a later setting. This drill may be repeated using other questions listed below.
Examples      Teacher: ¿Inkwa ne?
              Student: Ampayo. ‗Not yet.‘
              Teacher: ¿Inkwa ne?
              Student: Pan.           ‗Tomorrow.‘
              Teacher: ¿Inkwa ne?
              Student: Achul.         ‗Day after tomorrow.‘
              Teacher: ¿Inkwa ne?
              Student: Ibapaje.       ‗In three days‘ time.‘
The teacher should tell the student when to change from iba ‗day‘, to tummi ‗week‘, or to ni ‗month‘, or pirka
‗year‘.
         1. ¿Inkwa ne?                               ‗When are you going?‘
         2. ¿Inkwa immal amine?                      ‗When are you going to go hunting?‘
         3. ¿Inkwa ul chomne?                        ‗When are you going to build the canoe?‘
57
     -che follows a fortis consonant, -zhe follows a lenis consonant, -je follows a vowel.

The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
Example          Teacher: Ibapaje an karpa chomne.58
                 Student: Ibapaje an karpa chomne.
         1. Ibapaje an karpa chomne.                 ‗In three days‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         2. Ibabakeje an karpa chomne.               ‗In four days‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         3. Ibaatalzhe an karpa chomne.              ‗In five days‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         4. Tummigwenche an karpa chomne.            ‗In one weeks‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         5. Tummiboje an karpa chomne.               ‗In two weeks‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         6. Ni walagwenche an karpa chomne.          ‗In one months‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         7. Ni walaboje an karpa chomne.             ‗In two months‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         8. Ni walapaje an karpa chomne.             ‗In three months‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
         9. Pirkaboje an karpa chomne.               ‗In two years‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘
        10. Pirkanerkwaje an karpa chomne.           ‗In six years‘ time, I‘m going to make a basket.‘3) Position of time expressions in a sentence
        Time expressions (word/phrase/clause) usually occur at the beginning of a sentence. They may, however,
        occur after the subject of the sentence or at the end of the sentence.
Examples
    1. Mutik an ne.                ‗Tonight, I am going to go.‘
    2. Antin mutik ne.             ‗I am going to go tonight.‘
    3. An ne, mutik.               ‗I am going to go -- tonight!‘a) Time expressions at the beginning of a sentence
     As discussed in Section 12.4, a time expression most commonly occurs at the beginning of a sentence.
     This sentence initial position is indicated in certain situations.","[155, 156, 157, 158, 159]"
"2. Problem of adult language learning
A child will learn three or four languages without difficulty. Any new sound, word or grammatical construction
gets added to his repertoire. It will take him a while to separate out the systems of each language entirely. This
he will do provided he is exposed to environments where only one system is present. (Otherwise, he fails and
this leads to the formation of a Creole.)
By adulthood, however, the limited repertoire of sounds, words and grammatical systems of the mother tongue
has become so habitual (automatic) that they have formed almost a closed system. It takes will power,
determination and effort to learn new distinctions, new patterns, and new words. Adults do not enjoy repeating,
repeating and repeating things. But this is what it takes for the new sounds, words, and grammatical patterns to
become automatic. This is the only way to become fluent.
Now, there are ways of making the repetition more palatable, e.g., It is much better to ―become fluent‖ in a
prepared conversation by visiting a dozen homes and saying it in each home, than saying it to yourself twelve
times at your desk. (Besides, hopefully, the people you visit will correct you.)                                                       307
308                                                                                        Language Learning3. Speaking a language
In order to speak a language, you have to ―think‖ that language. You need to ―see‖ in that language and you
need to ―visualize‖ in that language. You should never translate into that language from the mother tongue or
bridge language. To illustrate this, when you see:
                                              Figure 9.
you think ulu, not ―canoe‖.
When you visualize:
                                              Figure 10.
you think An immal amine, not ―I‘m going to hunt.‖
You should never translate ―I‖ as ani, ―am going to‖ as -ne, or ―hunt‖ as ami, because often you will end up
with a mismatch, such as An (omitted) amine in which immal ‗thing, animal‘ has been omitted. It is also very
difficult to translate quickly enough.","[320, 321]"
"3.2.3.2 Intonation pattern of questions
A question has a different intonation pattern from a statement. The actual order of words in a question which requires
a yes/no answer is the same order as for a statement. Because the word order does not vary, it is important that you
learn the intonation patterns for questions versus statements in order to distinguish a question from an answer.
In Kuna, the pitch at which the question is said is higher than the pitch of a statement. The last word of a
question is even higher pitch than the rest of the question and then the pitch of that word falls off quickly.
Exercise 5. Yes/no question intonation drill
Mimic the intonation of the teacher by humming the the intonation of the following questions.
      1. ¿Pe mas chikne?                       ‗Are you going to cut plantains?‘
      2. ¿Pe mol pakne?                        ‗Are you going to buy cloth?‘
      3. ¿Pe ogob tigne?                       ‗Are you going to plant the coconut?‘
      4. ¿Pe ua tune?                          ‗Are you going to cook the fish?‘
      5. ¿Machi ob kunne?                      ‗Is the boy going to eat the corn?‘
      6. ¿Machi chowal chikne?                 ‗Is the boy going to cut the firewood?‘
26                                                                                          Conversational RepliesExercise 6. Yes/No question intonation pattern drill
The teacher drills the class using Sentences 1–5 below as yes/no questions.
Example       Teacher: ¿Machi ob kunne?
              Student: ¿Machi ob kunne?
      1. ¿Machi ob kunne?                ‗Is the boy going to eat corn?‘
      2. ¿Machi mas chikne?              ‗Is the boy going to cut plantains?‘
      3. ¿Machi immal amine?             ‗Is the boy going to hunt (something)?‘
      4. ¿Machi ina komne?               ‗Is the boy going to drink the medicine?‘
      5. ¿Machi ul chune?                ‗Is the boy going to fetch the canoe?‘
Note: The lenis consonant b becomes m when it occurs before n
Example       kob + -ne = komne               ‗going to drink‘
Exercise 7. Statement intonation pattern drill
The teacher drills the students using Sentences 1–5 below as statements.
Example      Teacher: Machi ob kunne.
             Student: Machi ob kunne.
      1. Machi ob kunne.                      ‗The boy is going to eat corn.‘
      2. Machi mas chikne.                    ‗The boy is going to cut plantains.‘
      3. Machi immal amine.                   ‗The boy is going to hunt (something).‘
      4. Machi ina komne.                     ‗The boy is going to drink the medicine.‘
      5. Machi ul chune.                      ‗The boy is going to fetch the canoe.‘
Exercise 8. Question and statement contrast
The teacher says one of the sentences above. The student has to identify whether the teacher has uttered a
question or a statement and writes ―question‖ or ―statement‖ on his answer sheet.
Examples         Teacher (says):        ¿Machi immal amine?
                 Student (writes):      question
                 Teacher (says):        Machi mas chikne.
                 Student (writes):      statement
If difficulty is experienced by the student in hearing the differences in the exercise, then the student should
practice Exercise 9.
Exercise 9. Question and statement contrast
The student should listen while the teacher repeats Sentences 1–5 in Exercise 6 above. The teacher then inserts
the following sentence between Sentences 4 and 5 as a statement (A) or as a question (B). The student has to tell
the teacher which has been used -- a question or a statement. The exercise should be repeated several times.
     A. Machi ua makne.                       ‗The boy is going to spear fish.‘
     B. ¿Machi ua makne?                      ‗Is the boy going to spear fish?‘
Exercise 10. Question and statement contrast
Repeat Exercise 9 using the statements in Exercise 7. Again, the student needs to distinguish whether the
statement (A) or the question (B) has been inserted.
Note: After Exercises 9 and 10 are successfully completed, Exercise 8 should be repeated.","[38, 39]"
"1. Awareness
First, you need to be made aware of the existence of a particular sound, word, grammatical construction or
intonation pattern and its meaning. Yon have to learn to ―hear‖ (recognize) it in a particular context. For
example, you find out (become aware) that toa means ―who‖ and start to ―hear‖ (recognize) it when it is used in
an amplificatory question (see Section 4.4.3.1).
Example       ¿Toa nade?                     ‗Who went?‘2. Reproduction
Then, you have to learn to reproduce (say) automatically the same particular sound, word, grammatical
construction, or intonation pattern in that particular context. For example, you practice using toa ‗who‘ in
amplificatory questions until you can do so without even thinking about it.",[322]
