"3.6    Question formationTwo functional types of question can be distinguished: constituent questions and
polar questions. The formation of questions requires the placement of an interrog-
ative proforms in the position of the requested information, and/or a change of the
intonation pattern (acoustic analyses can be found in §2.4.2.2).
3.6. QUESTION FORMATION                                                           1033.6.1 Polar questionsPolar questions, sometimes referred to in the literature as ‘yes-no questions’, can
be formed from basic verbal and non-verbal clauses by changing the intonation.
The distinguishing criterion is a pitch change located on the last two syllables, with
penultimate syllable rise in pitch, and a slight rise in pitch and elongation of the
last syllable (see §2.4.2.2).  (163)    ngə-tir     kup      ngan-e,        “me ta-ti∼vi            ko

           ‘[They told us everything about the mountain, ...we looked up to the
           mountain like that, the name of the mountain is Baram.] Then I asked
           (about everything) I said, “and people just go up there?”’
                                                                      [CM-B2-035]   The positive answer of a polar question is formed by either repeating the sen-
tence in an affirmative intonation, or the exclamation ‘mm’, or simply inhaling
with a gesture of lifting one’s head and raising the eyebrows.
   The negative answer is usually the negator kori. In the case of answering a
question of asking if one has anything, the negative answer is either kori go and/or
a gesture of twisting one’s hand and shrugging.","[134, 135]"

AbstractThe thesis is the first fairly comprehensive descriptive grammar of Tulil, a non-Austronesian
language spoken by approximately 2,000 speakers on East New Britain Island, Papua New
Guinea. The analysis in this grammar is based on primary field data collected during 9
months of fieldwork in the area, which comprises 12 hours of text data, complemented by
participant observation, elicitation and stimulus-based elicitation.
   The grammar provides an overview of all levels of grammar, covering phonology (ch.2),
basic clause structure (ch.3), word class (ch.4), noun phrase structure (ch.5), prepositions
(ch.6), demonstratives (ch.7), verb complex (ch.8), verb morphology (ch.9), nominal clas-
sification (ch.10), coordination (ch.11) and subordination (ch.12).
   Notable features of the language include split intransitivity, complex nominal classific-
ation system and complex verb morphology.
   There are two sub-systems of the nominal classification system in Tulil: a nominal class
system (11 different classes including distinction in sex, size, shape), and a gender system
(3 classes, only include sex). Different sub-systems are involved in different morphosyn-
tactic contexts: the nominal class system is mainly used inside the noun phrase, manifes-
ted as an enclitic as the last component of a core NP; and the gender system is used for
various person indexes such as verb indexes, possessive indexes, etc., and the free pronom-
inals/demonstratives can involve both systems.
   Verb morphology in Tulil is fairly complex. Multiple stems are involved in the forma-
tion of verbs related to different grammatical categories. Verb morphology involves mainly
prefixing, including person/number/gender/tense portmanteau prefixes marking A/SA ar-
guments, and reduplication (marking imperfective aspect). Multiple stems are involved
derivational processes include the applicative suffix and incorporation. The morphophon-
ological pattern of verb inflection in Tulil is not immediately transparent, and involves an
interaction between initial consonant mutation and reduplication of the stems.

                  ‘They said they were down there in the big valley.’           [LR-TH-064]3.7 NegationThere is a negator kori in Tulil, which can be used for clausal negation, usually
verbal clauses. Another negative strategy consists of kori NEG and the general
non-specific pronoun go ‘some’, used to negate non-verbal clauses/sub-clausal con-
stituents. kori can also be used with other non-specific pronouns such as gəta
‘someone.SG.CLF:MASC’, gətəm ‘someone.PL.CLF:HUM’ and gəvət
‘somewhere.SG.CLF:SEG’, meaning ‘no one (SG)’, ‘no one (PL)’ and ‘nowhere’.
    A general rule is that kori is mostly used for negation of verbal clause/subclausal
constituents, and kori go for negation of non-verbal clause/subclausal constituents,
though atypical cases exist in categorical boundaries. In this section, both clausal
and subclausal negation will be discussed.
    The short form ko is also used in fast speech35 .

Chapter 4Word classesIn this chapter, I attempt to formulate adequate definitions of word classes in Tulil.
The criteria for differentiation mostly consist of morphosyntactic characteristics,
with some concerns of semantics. There are two open classes - nouns and verbs - to
which new items can be added, and several closed classes: adjectives, pronominals,
numerals, quantifiers, demonstratives and adverbs. While some classes will be
discussed in more detail in other chapters (§6 prepositions, §7 demonstratives, §9
verb morphology), the other word classes will be discussed in more detail in this
chapter.","[141, 142, 143, 144, 145]"

and thought verbs such as məngar ‘say’, bokbok ‘talk’ and tən ‘think’. It can also be
used as a predicate itself, implying a real speech or thoughts. For instance, in 277a,
the first e follows the speech verb məngar ‘say’; while in 277b, it constitutes the
predicate. In both cases, e has a defective inflectional pattern (quotative indexes)
that does not reflect tense (§10.1.2.4).
   In the production of narrative in Tulil, speakers make extensive use of direct
speech. Direct quotes have the internal syntactic structure of typical clauses and
even multiple sentences. The speaker can not only quote the speech of a person,
but can also mimick with interjections, onomatopoeic expressions, or non-verbal
events.  (278) a. və-t∼tit            at-e,       kss, kss, kss.

introduction of clause structure in §3.1, two types of clauses in Tulil are described:
verbal clauses (§3.2) and non-verbal clauses (§3.3). Functions of different clauses
are discussed briefly in §3.1.2 and extensively in §3.4. Both types of clauses can
combine with negator and interrogative words to form negative utterances (§3.6)
and questions (§3.7).","[80, 81]"

and in-case functions. The two differ in that there is a direct causal link between
the two propositions in the avertive function, but not in the in-case function. So
we can see in in contrast, for example, in 294a, hiding in the bush prevents the
two to be found by Namugi, while in 294b, the fact that young men and women go
to sleep is not a consequence of our ‘not going’.

4.11.4   Emphatic particlesEmphatic particles include konəng, ava, eva, ar. avar is a complex morpheme
formed by ava + ar, and kavar means ‘just at that time’. All these morphemes
can express ‘only, just’ according to context they are used in, and the determina-
tion of semantic/pragmatic differences among these forms requires further studies.
ava/eva can also mean ‘again’, as well as indicating an explanation of reasons in
the following clause (‘it is just (because) that...’); ar can express still; and avar is a
mixture of both.
   konəng can follow an element and modify it. It can have a scope over a single
consitituent, or a phrase. konəng has a short form ko.The use of konəng inside an
NP is discussed in §5.1.1.  (295) a. nə-bət    o   kəvənav konəng=e        e-vi        to da

170   CHAPTER 4. WORD CLASSES
Chapter 5Noun phrase structureThis chapter deals with Tulil NP structure. The major characteristics of NP structure
in Tulil includes the following:    (A) NPs are typically headed by nouns, nominal/adverbial demonstratives, as
        well as non-specific pronoun and personal pronouns;
    (B) NPs are inflected for number and nominal classes, manifested by              (a) class marking encliticized to the end of the core elements of NP;
                  a default zero-class marking (idə in indexing) is given to NPs
                  without a specified class, such as NPs headed by nominalized
                  verbs or mass nouns, non-specific pronouns, etc.
              (b) pronominal indexes reflecting the class/number of NPs, on verbs,
                  possessive pronouns, prepositions etc.","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203]"
"76. Tulil has a comitative preposition n generally associated with meaning of ‘with’, see §6.4.3.2

11.2.1.2   Contrastive conjunctionConjunctive constructions can also express contrastiveness. Contrastive conjunc-
tions can be either symmetric (723) or asymmetric (724). In the latter case, it is
pragmatically problematic to reverse the two coordinands in this type of construc-
tion, when the last part rather than the first one needs to be emphasized.  (723)    [ a-vi        mən=ba tipur ava kori və-re           go

both clauses are of similar structure. This type of parellelled structure gives rise to
a contrastive reading.
    me is quite often used when an adversative interpretation can be applied. In
this case, me can express either 1) a denial of an expectation (725a), or 2) the con-
trast between a negative and positive expression (725b). This is called substitutive
adversative coordination by Haspelmath (2007:28).  (725) a. kəletuak o   doto ngi-t∼ton          mat =e         o

11.2.1.3 Temporal conjunctionConjunctive constructions describing temporal relations are asymmetric: the orders
of coordinands convey the temporal sequence of the events. Temporal conjunction
can be expressed by juxtaposition; coordinator me; io and topicalizer o.

    Another common structure is when a complex sentence starts with a string of
juxtaposed coordinate clauses/phrases (predicates), with io ‘and then’ leading the
last one.  (728)   [ du-vi      nə-m∼bo    ], [ du-mat      =a   tuk=a

below, the events linked by me happen in order, but the meaning of the sentence
is not emphasizing the order of the events, rather the fact that both of the events
happened, and collectively lead to the result (“he being happy”).  (729)   doto nga-kəbənət   ləm n    =idə, me nga-nu      =a

me ‘and’, but can be considered to have a coordinating function when me is not

just applies to the clause it attaches to (742), and if both clauses are to be negated,
then negators need to be expressed on both clauses (743).

370   CHAPTER 11. COORDINATION
Chapter 12SubordinationTraditionally, a simple dichonomy between coordination and subordination is drawn
between terms of clause combining strategies: conjuncts have equal grammatical
status in coordinate constructions, while subordinates have unequal status in the
subordinate constructions. Formally, the distinction is usually based on criteria
such as dependency (the subordinate clause is dependent on the main clause) and
clausal embedding (the subordinate clause takes on a syntactic function in the
main clause) (cf. Lyons, 1968:178 and Haspelmath 1995).
   Also, a differentiation between embedding and hypotaxis is usually made: em-
bedded clauses are those that take up a function in the main clause [+embedded],
while hypotactic clauses are also dependent on the main clause, but relate to the
main clause as a whole [-embedded] (Matthiessen & Thompson, 1988). In this
sense, complement clauses (functioning as NPs) and relative clauses (functioning
as modifiers inside NP) are usually classified as embedding, and adverbial clauses
(function as adverbials) as hypotactic (Matthiessen & Thompson, 1988).
   However, it is recognized in cross-linguistic studies that neither the distinction
between subordination/coordination nor the one between embedding and hypo-
taxis is a clear-cut one, but rather a syntactic continuum involving a number of
independent parameters (Lehmann, 1988; Givón, 1990).
   In Tulil, all three types of subordinate clauses can be identified:

of the traditional criteria of dependency and embedding. In Tulil, the following
strategies of subordination and embedding are involved in subordinate clause form-
ation:      (A) Special verb form: Nominalized verbs (gerundive)
      (B) Subordinating morphemes:               (a) morphemes with no lexical meaning: to general subordinator;
               (b) morphemes with lexical meaning: doto ‘when/if’; mata ‘until
                   (time)’; tove ‘because’; da (purpose) ti (negative purpose/in-case);
                   kati (counterfactual condition); ka;
               (c) use of topic markers as separator of subordinate clause and main
                   clauses (after subordinate clause and preceding main clause).","[391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404]"
"1.5 Typological profileAs mentioned earlier, Tulil (Butam), along with the Baining languages, is usually
grouped into the East Papuan languages, which are thought to be the descendants
of the languages spoken by the original inhabitants of Island Melanesia, before
the more recent settlement of the Austronesian people. East Papuan languages are
usually reported to show more influence from Austronesian languages than other
Papuan languages, due to their geographical vicinity. Dunn et al. (2002) examine
the structural features of the East Papuan languages from a typological point of
view. Among the similarities proposed for these languages, the pronominal system
is often highlighted for grouping purposes. Ross (2001, 2005) provides evidence to
suggest a East Papuan group based on comparison of the pronoun paradigms. Also,
descriptive data suggests that almost all of the East Papuan languages have some
sort of nominal classification system (cf. Terrill, 2002). Though it is pointed out
that gender system are not impossible to be borrowed (Dunn et al., 2002:29), both
the Tulil and the Butam language show nominal classification systems similar to
the Baining languages (nominal classification system of Tulil is elaborated in this
study, cf. chapter 10) and complex to an extent that it does not seem to be easily
borrowed.
    A list of relevant typological features of Tulil is provided in Table 1.2, with
reference to features of both the western Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family
and the Trans New Guinean type Papuan languages (features of the two groups
adapted from Ross, 1996:186). Table 1.3 compares the features of Tulil to both
Tolai (Mosel, 1984) and Mali Baining (Stebbins, 2011). The bolded features in
both Tables show the features that other groups have that are similar to the Tulil
language.
    Tulil has a fairly simple phonological system, similar to what is observed for
most Papuan languages (Foley, 1986:48-64). It has a phoneme inventory of me-
dium size, with 15 consonants and 6 vowels (cf. §2). Four places (bilabial, alveolar,

by full noun phrases, but by the compulsory portmanteau person prefixes on verbs
(A/SA arguments expressed by NP constitute approximately 12% among all cases)9 .
    Unlike in Tolai and Baining languages, where preposed articles are utilized for
marking definiteness in common nouns, Tulil only has a prefixal article a- which
marks borrowed words (cf. §4.2). Proper names also take articles in Tulil: the
articles are to for men and e for women. This is similar to the Tolai language
where names of men are marked by to and women by la (Mosel, 1984:17-19).
    Tulil makes a distinction between alienable and inalienable possession (cf.§4.2.4,
§5.8), marked by different possessor indexes attaching to a possessed noun. Inali-
enable possessive indexes differ from alienable possessive indexes in 1SG and 3SG,
and these inalienable possessive indexes tend to cliticized to the possessum. The

body parts and kinships, but not all members of these categories are inalienably
possessed.
    Tulil does not have an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the 1st person pronom-
inals. This distinction is often found in Austronesian languages, but is not com-
mon in Papuan languages, except East Papuan languages. However, the feature
is not known to be present in Papuan languages in East New Britain (Dunn et al.,
2002:40). Tulil pronominals make a three-way number distinction: singular, dual
and plural.
    Tulil has a category of prepositions (Tolai has prepositions and Baining postpos-
itions) with a large set of members, which shows a certain degree of heterogeneity
in terms of morphosyntax (§6).
    Concerning the function of demonstratives as spatial deictics, the relative dis-
tance may be measured based on the position of the speaker exclusively, or the
speaker and hearer. As pointed out by Foley (1986:75), Papuan languages most
commonly have a deictic system of the first type, ranging from a two-term system
(‘this’ and ‘that’) to more complicated ones with other parameters such as visibility
and elevation, while Austronesian languages usually have a three-way distance dis-
tinction (close to speaker, close to hearer, and away from both). Both Mali Baining
(Stebbins, 2011:76-82) and Tolai (Mosel, 1982) in the area seem to have a system
of the first type, with additional parameters pertaining to landscapes, etc. Tulil
uses a combination of the two types, like some other Papuan languages such as
Fore (Scott 1978). Tulil shows a three-way distinction on the distance scale: near
speaker, near hearer, and away from both; on a larger distance scale, other para-
meters are also involved, such as elevation and specific landmarks such as the sea
(§7).
    Verb morphology in Tulil is fairly complex (cf. §9). Multiple stems are involved
in the formation of verbs related to different grammatical categories. Verb mor-
phology involves mainly prefixing, including A/SA person/number/gender/tense
portmanteau prefixes and reduplication (imperfective aspect). Derivational pro-
cesses include the applicative suffix and incorporation. The morphophonological
pattern of verb inflection in Tulil is not immediately transparent, and involves an
interaction between initial consonant mutation and reduplication of stems (§2.5.5).
Mood in Tulil is marked by adverbial particles.
   Tulil has a rather complex nominal classification system, with 11 different nom-
inal classes based on sex, size and shape, usually manifested in NP-related struc-
tures, and a smaller system of 3 gender distinctions (masculine, feminine, neuter),
manifested as person indexes on verbs, possessives, etc (§10). Nominal classific-
ation has been proposed as a possible distinctive characteristic common to the

Solomons region (Terrill, 2002), and is not found in any of the Austronesian lan-
guages of the area. However, among these languages, only the Baining languages
have a large set of distinctions (Stebbins, 2005, 2011:136-155), similar to what we
find in Tulil.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"

   When to is used as a preposition, it can be optionally indexed like other preposi-
tions. However the forms of indexes used in this case are different from indexes on
other prepositions (cf.§4.7.7). It is difficult to identify whether the index is present
or not, when the modified NPs have SG.MASC/FEM class markings a/e: in this case,
the index of to have the same form a/e with the nominal class markings, and the
vowel deletion rule in hiatus (§2.5.1) delete one of the vowels in this case (for
instance: /maoka/ + /ato/ → /maokato/). However, when the person index is 3
neuter singular (unspecified gender), it is optional (present in 472b and omitted in

havior of comitative n (see §6.4.3.2). In this case, the person index of to is com-
pulsory, as a strategy to identify the modified NP. However, differing from to ‘of’,
comitative n always has to be accompanied by a person index.  (473)   a-vi        ror=a,                a-vi        o   a-to

the source and goal of a change of location: mən ‘from’ SOURCE; tə ‘to’ GOAL. They
can also precedes other type of adjuncts such as temporal/locational adverbs and
adverbial demonstratives, see §3.5.4.
    The following example shows the simple preposition be ‘at’ combining with both
of the directional clitics:

positions encoding physical locations are more likely to be procliticized with dir-
ectional clitics. Almost all the prepositions indicating specific locations (such as
‘in’, ‘at’, ‘on’ and ‘under’) can be attached by the orientational clitics, and result in
rather transparent meanings. Here are some more examples:  (476) a. ava və-kər            =tang      mən=da vit=e

Chapter 7DemonstrativesDemonstratives are defined by Himmelmann in terms of the following two charac-
teristics Himmelmann (1996:210): firstly, an element must be in a paradigmatic
relation to elements which locate the entity referred to on a distance scale when
used exophorically; secondly, the element should not be amenable to uses which
are characteristic of definite articles.
    This definition expands the functional class of demonstratives to include not
only the basic ones that make reference to locations on a distance scale (proximal,
distal, etc.), but also spatial reference terms that are not distance-based (e.g. elev-
ation, landforms), usually defined as a separate class called ‘directionals’ in other
grammars (cf. Hyslop, 2001; Stebbins, 2011). In Tulil, these geocentric forms have
the same morphological and distributional properties as the basic demonstratives
(like ‘this’ and ‘that’), and they can entail participant- and distance-oriented uses
in both cases where a speaker/addressee is involved (e.g. down there from where
the speaker is standing) or not (e.g. down there where another object/person in
the narrative is standing).
    On the other hand, the definition excludes spatial deictics that are in themselves
adverbs, such as do ‘here; now’. Another specification that one can add to the
definition of demonstrative in Tulil is that the primary use of demonstratives is
nominal. This means, all demonstrative s can be used adnominally, co-occurring
with nouns (Table 7.2). The necessity of including this point lies in the fact that
there are cases like the restrictive verb vəde ‘(come) this way (towards self)’, which
has spatial deictic function, and can be used predicatively (480a) and adverbially
(480b), but cannot be used nominally/pronominally. A full list of demonstrative
stems is shown in Table 7.1 (the original meaning of each term is bolded).  (480) a. avar a-vi         a-te,      ‘ngi-vəde’.

   Tulil demonstratives have three types of forms: 1) substantive forms (SUBS) with
person index before the demonstrative stems; 2) local adverbial forms (L-ADV) with
locative prefix nə-; 3) manner adverbial forms (M-ADV). Different forms utilize all
or a subset of the possible demonstrative stems, and subsume spatial deictics of
various syntactic functions, as shown in Table 7.2, and examples can be found in
481 to 483. Demonstrative stems can be either simple or derived (§7.1.1).","[264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273]"

3.1.3 Form and meaning correlationIn the previous section basic functions of clause types were discussed. Different
semantic categories are roughly reflected24 in the basic clause types, and will be
discussed in detailed in §3.4. Figure 3.1 shows a mapping between predicate types
and the semantic predicate categories. Dotted lines show that the clause type plays
a minor role in expressing the relevant semantic types (special cases). Other func-
tions such as existential are not shown on the mapping.
   Different types of clauses and their features are summarized in Table 3.1. The
table shows clearly the difference between verbal and non-verbal clauses. The
various types of clauses are exemplified by the following sentences and will be
further elaborated in the following sections.
   A more detailed description of form-meaning correlation is given in the form
of a feature table. It is often observed that the basic clause types show gradient
24. For instance, when a iamitive marker b occurs in a non-verbal clause, the clause expresses a change of
state, and could be seen as a type of event. This is not taken into consideration here.

PTV25 defined by Andrews 2007) to prototypical nominal clause (type II nominal
clause in the case of Tulil).
   Person marking, patientive case and constituent order are defining features of
25. PTV is a transitive verb taking two arguments, with their semantic roles being an agent and a patient.
Accordingly, A, as a grammatical function, is the argument which receives the same grammatical treatment as
the agent of PTV, and P the same as the patient. S is defined as the only argument of a one-argument predicate.
3.1. INTRODUCTION                                                                 55verbal clauses, and will be discussed in §3.4. Reduplication and Negation are
two diagnostic features concerning the distinction of verbal and non-verbal clause.
We can see that the more prototypical verbal clauses such as (di)transitive and
active intransitive clauses and prototypical nominal clauses show consistent and
unambiguous features on these two aspects, while impersonal clauses, stative-
intransitive clause and locative clauses are less verbal-like, yet not fully nominal
clauses.
    Reduplication is only used in verb clauses (cf. §9 verb morphology), and never
occurs in non-verbal clauses. In transitive/active-intransitive clauses, reduplica-
tion encodes imperfective aspect (continuative, habitual) in both past (51a) and
non-past tenses (51b). Impersonal clauses have no perfective forms but only im-
perfective forms (52). In stative-intransitive clauses, reduplication encodes intens-
ity (53a) and continuation (53b). Locative clause as a special case of intransitive
clause, does not involve reduplication forms.","[85, 86, 87]"

4.1 IntroductionTulil is a language displaying a certain degree of flexibility in word classes (cf.
Rijkhoff & van Lier, 2013). For example in (190), the root tədor can function as
the heads of the NP, verb complex, and modifier of NP or VC head. This flexibility
is not uncommon across the lexicon.  (190) a. Head of NP: ‘power, strength’
           voin=a              va          tədor o   bə  kori

             strong
             ‘Now this sun is strong (lit: stood strongly).’          [AL-RM-028]   It is also common for a borrowed root to take different functions across verbal
and nominal domains.  (191) a. tə-p∼poto          mat ta.
           3PL.PST-IPFV∼photo take 3PL
              ‘They took photos of them. ’                             [PP-PH-018]          b. bə= tə-mat        =a   a-poto.
             IAM= 3PL.PST-take =PAT ART-photo
              ‘They took the photo.’                                   [PP-PH-019]   On word level, there is no difference in morphological marking among non-
verbs such as nouns, adjectives and adverbs (except that borrowed nouns are marked
by the prefixal article a-). One characteristic of the language is that many gram-
matical features are marked on phrasal level rather than on a morphological level.
For instance, the nominal class marker is on the NP level rather than on the noun
root (§5.7). Verbs differ from non-verbs in that they can be marked by inflectional
verb morphology such as person indexes (§9).
4.2. NOUNS                                                                                              115    On root level, one productive derivational process can be identified, which is
nominalization, by means of reduplication. The reduplicative form used in nomin-
alization is the same form as non-finite verb forms such as infinitives, gerunds and
coverbs (cf.§9.2).  (192)     bə= məle nging be t∼tirN da maok=a,            ... bə= kori

            2SG.NPST-ask
            ‘you stop (at) asking for space, don’t ask.’                                   [SV-N1-020]    The degree of flexibility in word classes in Tulil requires more specialized invest-
igation, and certain observations clearly support the idea of assuming conversion
across word classes. For instance, prototypical nouns referring to people or entit-
ies are never found to be used as head of a verb complex and processes involving
nouns such as ‘become a man’ are expressed by non-verbal clauses §3.3.
    Thus, the purpose of this chapter is to identify the features that are associ-
ated with various classes of words, rather than drawing categorial distinctions
between classes. However, I will make some arbitrary choices on top of the criteria
provided, but at the same time bear in mind the possibility of finding more items
flexibly used in different functions, if provided with more data.

4.2 NounsNouns are the second-largest word class (after verbs). It is an open class to which
new items such as loanwords can be added.
  The defining properties of nouns are the following:
116                                                                  CHAPTER 4. WORD CLASSES      i.    Morphology: borrowed nouns and person names can be prefixed by art-
            icles.
      ii.   Syntax: nouns take a specific position in the noun phrase structure, and
            occur as the leftmost (the head position) element in a core NP (cf. §5.1.1),
            or as modifier (property noun). Nouns can be possessed and the possessor
            occurs left of the head noun. Nouns have intrinsic gender that manifests
            itself as nominal class marking at the end of the core NP, or they may be
            reassigned to other nominal classes that are size/shape-based.","[145, 146, 147, 148]"
"7.4.3 Discourse deixisDiscourse deixis encodes reference to some portion of the text in which the utter-
ance is located (Levinson, 1983:85). It means that discourse deixis can refer to
an earlier or forthcoming portion of the discourse relative to the speaker’s current
location in the discourse. Similar to the anaphoric use of the demonstratives, the
commonly used ones in Tulil are deictic and spatial terms: vi (upcoming text), bət
and bo (earlier text).  (556)   a-pir     idil u-vi      o   nandi.

Chapter 8Structure of the verb complexIn this chapter, I will discuss the structure of the verb complex. The verb complex
is the head of the verbal clause (cf. §3.2), as shown in Figure 8.1. A verb complex
comprises the head (§8.2), verbal adjuncts (§8.3), and flagging/serial verbs (§8.4).
    Pre-VC elements that are commonly related to verbal operators are considered
to be clause-level constituents, rather than components of the VC, given the fact
that they behave similarly to both verbal and non-verbal predicates (cf. §3.1.4).
These constituents include irrealis ka/aka, iamitive bə and the negator kori/ko, and
are discussed in §4.11. bə and da are particles that can also precede phrase-level
constituents. Details of these elements can be found in word class chapter (§4).
    O/SO arguments, oblique arguments and adjuncts occur as post-VC elements.  (559)   [ də-tukmən mat ]VC [ =a   tivən ]O nPREP [ =a doedə ]OBL

fective aspect), as well as the applicative suffix nə/mə and incorporation. The
morphological structure of Tulil verbs will be discussed in §9.","[306, 307]"

ive rather than an adverb), suggesting that this clause type has some verbal-like

ments and adjuncts are similar in verbal and non-verbal clauses, including particles
that are commonly verbal operators in other languages. These constituents in-
clude irrealis ka/aka/dame (§4.11.1), iamitive perfect bə (§4.11.2), purposive da
(§4.11.3) and negation kori/ko (§3.6). Most of these particles can occur on most
structural levels inside a sentence, and the structures shown in Figure 3.2 and 3.3
only represent these particles when they have a scope over the predicates. Details
of these elements can be found in the word class chapter (§4). Several examples
of co-occurring possibilities of these elements in verbal and non-verbal clauses are
shown in examples 59 to 63.     (59)   iu  o   ka bə   iu-re         venang kurek=a

3.4    Functions of verbal and non-verbal clausesIn Tulil, the event predicates are exclusively verbal, thus will not be discussed in
further details. This section will focus on functions of clauses related to class mem-
bership, property, state, location, possession, as well as non-predicational functions
such as existential and identificational.

class/number marking is marked at the end of the NP (cf. §5). A similar example
is shown by a noun of property used in a possessive NP:  (125)    tivən=e         e-vi        ve            təməng laik=a.

           ‘This rock is very heavy (lit. this rock’s heaviness).’                   [E]   A type II nominal clause is the most common way to express class membership
and property. When the subject is human, type III clauses can also fulfil these
functions, given its restrictive use for human subjects (cf. §3.3.2). When a property
word is involved in the predicative NP, both types of clauses can express property
meaning. The structural difference between the two clauses is discussed in §3.3.2.
The functional difference is that type II nominal clauses tend to sit closer to the
90                                             CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE‘class membership’ end and type III nominal clauses to the ‘property’ end of the
continuum.
    There are two types of closely-related functions expressed by type III clauses,
related to its tendency to express property: firstly, it assigns a single property to the
entity (usually involves an adjective in the NP, such as ləm ‘young’ in 126), rather
than categorizing the entity. The adjective ləm ‘young’ here designates a specific
property rather than defines a category ‘young man’, because it can be modified
by degree modifiers such as moli ‘really’ in this case.     (126) a. [ lok ləm=ip            ]PRED ngun me ta-vi     o   bə=

of properties related to the members of a certain class (‘feature bundles’ as in Wi-
erzbicka 1986, e.g. possessing property of ‘devil’ or ‘Tulil people’ in 127) and em-
phasizes its relevance to the contexts. For instance, the difference between 128a
and 128b is that the latter tend to (but not necessarily) assert and emphasize that
“I” possess the property of prototypical ‘males’ such as braveness in the context of
128b, while type II nominal clauses usually do not have this interpretation. In the
context of example 128c, the speaker was emphasizing the fact that because ‘I’ was
a boy (possess the sexuality of ‘male’) in contrast with being a girl, so ‘my’ mum
wanted to kill ‘me’ when ‘I’ was born.     (127) a. [ ngang ]TOPIC o   voin=a            ngang.

specific reason that is indicated in other parts of the sentence. In the same sense of
what has been shown for the contrast in 128, 129 shows a case where an emphasis
of ‘family relationship’ is crucial for ‘you’ not ’to be killed’.  (129) a. To-Kalulu o  məte nga         makut=a.

that assigns the noun root lok ‘man’ into the feminine nominal class. The first
sentence is strange because it is not culturally salient to acknowledge a category of
‘manly woman’. The same predicate is acceptable in the structure of 130b, where
the use of the predicate is to assign the prototypical man property to a female:

subject into the class of ‘white men’ in the sense that he can actually belong to
the ethnic group, which would be contradicting reality, but emphasizing the ste-
reotypical properties of this group perceived from the local people’s view, such as
‘wearing trousers instead of laplap’, or ‘not working (in the gardens)’.     (131) məgət o   tar=ta          tat-e,        da   iap   o

differences across languages (cf. Downing, 1978; Keenan & Comrie, 1977), such as
the one given by Comrie & Kuteva as ‘a clause narrowing the potential reference
of a referring expression by restricting the reference to those referents of which a
particular proposition is true’ (2013). Syntactically, relative construction consists
of a ‘pivot constituent’ (usually an NP) and a subordinate clause (the relative clause)
(De Vries, 2002:14).
    According to the Accessibility Hierarchy of Relativization (subject > direct ob-
ject > indirect object > oblique argument > genitive) proposed by Keenan and
Comrie (1977), it is easier to relativize positions higher on the hierarchy than it
is to relativize on lower positions, and a strategy that can be used for relativizing
lower positions must be available to higher positions. The syntactic constructions
of RC can differ typologically according to three parameters (cf. Lehmann 1986;
Keenan 1985; Andrews 2007)85 :      (A) Position of the semantic head: whether the semantic head is inside
          (internally-headed) or outside the RC (externally-headed; preposed or
          postposed) (also see Dryer 2013);
85. While Andrews considers interally/externally headed to be a subdivision under embedded RCs, Lehmann
adopted a view that internally/externally headed and embedded/adjoined are two independent parameters.
I will arbitrarily adopt the latter here as it employs a broader scope of ‘head’ as the functional head of the
relative clause.

        or embedded in the main clause.","[424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431]"
"4.7.2 Non-specific pronounsThe non-specific go ‘some’, apart from being a pre-nominal modifier in the NP, can
also function as a pronoun, often found in negative and non-specific contexts. NPs
headed by non-specific pronouns are discussed in §5.4, and when functioning in
non-A/SA positions, the NPs headed by non-specific pronouns have to be marked
by patientive marker =a.  (237)    ngi-lur        mən =a   go    tuk ngang.

(eg. full paradigm see §10.1.1.2). The same form go as interrogative proform ‘who’
inflects only for gender and has a different inflectional pattern (for instance gət-a
for non-specific pronoun and guria for interrogative proform in masculine class,
§3.6.2). Examples show some inflected non-specific pronouns in different classes,
and the used of non-specific pronouns with negator kori:  (238) a. doto ta-pən-m          =a   gət-a             be p∼pən

and can be used as O/SO argument (239) or complement of preposition (240). It
cannot be modified by anything, and is not preceded by patientive marker =a.

           ‘The ferule was just there, that he put it beside himself.’   [RR-AD-034]
    tang ‘REFL/RECP’ expresses both reciprocal and reflexive meanings, as shown by
examples above (239 reciprocal, 240 reflexive). Even though the reciprocal and
reflexive meanings are clearly different (‘each other’ vs. ‘oneself’), the contexts are
usually able to resolve the ambiguity. For instance, in 239, if the comitative con-
struction ‘we and the spirits’ is not present, the clauses can have ambiguous mean-
ing: ‘we don’t see each other/ourselves, and we don’t know each other/ourselves’.
However, with the comitative construction, it is clear that ‘we’ and ‘the spirits’ are
reciprocals.
   tang tends to form idiomatic expressions with certain verbs, such as in :

          mugati    ‘share’            mugati tang      ‘share among’
    However, tang ‘REFL/RECP’ is not incorporated into the verb with certain nouns
(for instance, the noun gati ‘share’ forms the verb mugati ‘share’ with the verb mu
‘put’, see §9.1.5), given that manner adverbials (such as mərek ‘good’, kup ‘all’) can
still occur in between.

   However, the V + tang formation is idiomatic in three senses. First, the use of
tang as an object of the verb does not always conform to the argument structure of
the verb. For instance, the verb mugati ‘share’ usually takes the ‘shared things’ as
the object 244a, while in the expression mugati tang, the ‘shared thing’ becomes the
oblique argument, and tang REFL/RECP is the direct object, as shown in example
244b.

components. For instance, the meaning of pe extends from ‘tie’ to ‘wear’ when
accompanied by tang. Thirdly, the V + tang expression may form a unit that serves
as base for derivation, such as the derived noun petang=e formed by pe + tang and
a nominal class marking, meaning ‘clothes; dressing’:  (245)    tə-p∼pe          mat tang       n    =a

4.7.4 Verbal indexesVerbal indexes are two sets of pronominal prefixes that index the A/SA arguments,
reflecting the number, person and gender of A/SA argument, and also intertwined
with the tense system (two sets as of indexes for PST and NPST). Examples are
shown in 3.2.1.1 and full paradigms of forms with discussions can be found in
10.1.2.1.
    In contrast to personal pronouns, verbal indexes are always obligatory as long
as there is A/SA arguments in the verbal clause.","[173, 174, 175, 176]"

be measured based on the position of the speaker exclusively, or the speaker and
hearer. As pointed out by Foley (1986:75), Papuan languages most commonly have
a deictic system of the first type, ranging from a two-term system (‘this’ and ‘that’)
to more complicated ones with other parameters such as visibility and elevation,
while Austronesian languages usually have a three-way distance distinction (close
to speaker, close to hearer, and away from both). Both other languages of the
area, Mali Baining (Stebbins, 2011:76-82) and Tolai (Mosel, 1982) have a system
of the first type, with additional parameters concerning landscapes, etc. Tulil uses

(Scott, 1978:82). In Tulil, there is a three-way distinction on the distance scale:
near speaker, near hearer, and away from both; on a larger distance scale, other
parameters are also involved, such as elevation and landscape. The semantics of
the spatial deictic use of demonstratives will be discussed in §7.2.
    In addition to their primary use as exophoric deixis to refer to an element that
is external to the text (spatial deictics, temporal deictics, etc.), demonstratives have
a range of endophoric functions as well to make text-internal references (Halliday
& Hasan, 1976:57-76). The endophoric use is subdivided into the (i) anaphoric,
(ii) discourse deictic, and (iii) recognitional uses, following Himmelmann (1997).","[273, 274, 275]"

3.2.2.1 Impersonal clauseImpersonal clause26 is a special type of verbal clause in Tulil, with impersonal verbs
(mostly psych-verbs such as ‘be hungry’, ‘forget’, ‘shiver’) as head (a full list of im-
personal verbs can be found in §4.3.2). Impersonal clauses are either transitive or
26. The term ‘impersonal’, as pointed out by many (cf. Creissels, 2008; Siewierska, 2008; Malchukov & Ogawa,
2011) has been used in the literature to refer to various heterogeneous structures. Here I followed the definition
of the term by Siewierska (2008:116), that ‘impersonal’ is “from the structural point of view associated with
the lack of a canonical subject, from the functional perspective with agent defocusing.”

argument, and instead represent a non-referential (dummy) argument. Morpholo-
gically, the person indexes of A/SA arguments used in a impersonal construction are
restricted to 3rd person neuter prefixes, with the distinction of tense (idə- 3N.PST,
iT- 3N.NPST) retained. This means that comparing to A/SA arguments of other
transitive verbs, the parameter lost in the grammatical A/SA argument in this case
is the person and number distinction. Also, the impersonal verbs only have imper-
fective aspect forms, represented by reduplication (details of verb morphology can
be found in §9). The morphosyntactic property of P argument is not affected when
the clause is transitive, and this P argument becomes the ‘notional subject’.

    In the above examples of transitive impersonal clauses, the A arguments being
indexed by the 3rd person neuter prefixes idə- and iT- are all non-referential. For
instance, it is quite unlikely that the grammatical A argument in 82a is referential as
in ‘something hungry me’. In 82b, even though ‘the food grows us’ (mətmət ‘food’
as mass noun can be related to 3rd neuter person) seems to work semantically,
the sentence *mətmət ittu udu with mətmət as the NP argument is ungrammatical27 .
Thus the grammatical P arguments ngang ‘1SG’ and udu ‘1PL’ are the only referential
arguments, and thus the notional S arguments in these examples.
   A transitive impersonal construction normally expresses experience, with the
experiencer as the object. On the other hand, the agent or causer is usually specified
by oblique structure (83).","[99, 100]"

ized complements behave like NPs, and can be introduced by patientive marking
when functioning as O/SO arguments, and follow prepositions/applicatives when
functioning as obliques.

   Complementizers are morphemes that function to identify a clause as a com-
plement. Elements that can be used as complementizers are da PURP (desiderative
meaning), general subordinator to and quotative e. Complementizers may have
semantic functions and different meanings arise for the same CTV to be associ-
ated with different complementizers (cf. Boye & Kehayov, 2016). Examples in
(778) show the different meanings of complement clauses of the CTV təm ‘know’
when combining with nominalized complements (778a), complementizers da PURP
(778b) and quotative e (778c).

   In the above examples, (778c) with the quotative e encodes a propositional
complement, while both (778a) and (778b) mark state of affairs complements,
meaning ‘know how to’. The difference between the two is that the complement
led by da PURP has the connotation of an intention to accomplish something, while
the nominalized complements simply state the ability. This can be seen clearly
when the verb is negated. For instance, both examples in (779) express a lacking
of certain ability, but (779b), the complement clause led by da PURP also suggest
an intention to accomplish a result that is associated with the ability.

    Another example is the CTV tən, which has basically two meanings: ‘think’ and
‘think of doing sth.’, according to the complement it takes: quotative e is associated
with propositional complements (780a) and da PURP with state of affairs comple-
ments (780b). The two meanings can be categorized into two different semantics
types respectively: propositional attitude and desiderative.

   The interpretation of CTVs also depends on coreferencing between the main
clause and the complement clause. For instance, the two examples in (781) both
involve the verb məngar ‘say’ and the morpheme da expressing desiderative. In
(781a), when the addressee is the same as the subject of the complement clause,
məngar means ‘tell someone to do’ and expresses manipulative meanings such as or-
der/advice; while in (781b), when the subjects of the main clause and complement
clause are the same, məngar simply describes the utterance event, which includes
the will of the subject. As suggested by Hansen et al. (2016:183), this difference in
meaning is ‘not from strict syntactic rules, but rather from the issues of volitionality
and the capability of the agent to influence the state of affairs’.

12.2.1     Classes of complement-taking verbsTulil has seven different classes of complement-taking verbs, according to the se-
mantic classes of CTVs defined in Noonan (2007), as shown in Table 12.2. Also
there are adjectives/nouns that can take complements, such as mərek ‘be good’
(positive evaluation).
    Certain verbs can be used in more than one semantic classes (marked by sub-
scripts of numbers), and the different uses are associated with the choice of com-
plementizers, as discussed in the section above. The complementizers commonly
associated with each CTV is also shown in Table 12.2.","[418, 419, 420, 421, 422]"
"   We have seen from earlier discussions (cf. §8.3) that verbal adjuncts inside the
VC cannot precede an argument directly and has to be followed by a slot 3 element
when the VC still asks for an argument. In this case, the patient-like argument of
the transitive verb is usually preceded by applicative n:  (592)   a-mənə     tenəvərtovo [ tə-kul      ]VC =a   ləvək=pənik,

personal transitive verbs, given that the argument following VC is the sole argument
for these verbs, and thus is obligatory in the VC, when there is a verbal adjunct
present:  (593) a. vatər           tədərngəp me b=   [ idə-bok     ]VC =a

8.4.3 Serial verbsVerb serialization refers to “the juxtaposition of two or more verbs, each of which
would also be able to form a sentence of its own”, defined by Bisang (1996:533). I
adopt the following criteria in identifying serialization in Tulil (adapted from Durie
1997:291):      1)    The serial verbs make up the predicate of a single clause, with no clause
            boundary or dependency marker in between;
      2)    constitute one single prosodic entity, without pause;
      3)    share the same tense and aspect, marked on the V1 ; share mood, polarity,
            marked by particles which have scope over the involved verbs.
66. as defined by Dixon as ‘a construction involving the specification of an additional argument, a causer onto
a basic clause’ (Dixon, 2000:30).

   Verb serialization is not particularly prevalent in Tulil - three verbs (mat ‘get’,
tuk ‘give’ and vari ‘help’) can be used as serial verbs. These verbs in Tulil can occur
in different positions (examplified by mat ‘get’, not limited to serial verbs):    1)         head verb in a VC (598);
    2)         slot 2 inside VC, non-finite form, converb (599);
    3)         slot 3 inside VC, nuclear-type, symmetrical SVC (600);
    4)         preceding oblique argument, core-type, symmetrical SVC (601);

rare: 1) the serial verb is used as slot 3 element in a VC (a nuclear-type, symmetrical
SVC), denoting a sequence of actions; 2) the serial verb is used to lead an oblique
argument (a core-type, symmetrical SVC). This section will focus on the discussion
of the first type, and in many of these cases the serial verbs still lose some of their
lexical contents and have been grammaticalized to a certain degree.8.4.3.1 mat ‘take’The verb mat ‘take’ has the greatest flexibility to occur in multiple positions in a
verb clause (598 to 602). It is the only verb that can occur in all three slots - verb
root, verbal adjunct (non-finite form), and slot 3, while still keeping its semantic
property as a full verb (603). However no examples have been found for mat to
take up both slot 2 and slot 3 at the same time, also no examples were found for
mat to be modified by the converb m∼mat ‘completive’.

294                                 CHAPTER 8. STRUCTURE OF THE VERB COMPLEX   The difference between 604 and 605 is that, in the former examples, mat adds
the meaning of ‘get’: in 604b, it is possible to cut and leave (even though from the
context we know the ‘getting’ can be inferred); while in 605b, it is quite unlikely
for someone to buy without taking. In this sense, mat emphasizes the sense of
‘obtaining’. The effect of mat can be subtle, as also shown in the following two
examples:  (606) bə= tə-mənan      mat =a    a-tepelin    idil=von

a new participant, with various semantic roles associated with the ‘affectee’:  (608) ngar mat/tuk ‘talk to’

tuk in these cases is that tuk emphasizes a ‘give - receive’ relationship, while mat
emphasizes a sense of ‘obtain - affected (by the obtention)’. A similarly subtle
difference can be observed from applicative n and mat in the following examples,
8.4. FLAGGING AND SERIAL VERBS                                                   295where the former is merely stating the fact of ‘lying’, and the latter emphasizes the

reading. For instance, the verb manəng ‘chase; run’ means ‘bring sb. [here]’ after
combining with mat (611); and the intransitive verb matər ‘stand’ means ‘wait for
sb.’ (612a) or ‘start with sth.’ (612b).  (611) du-p∼pi         da   du-manəng mat =a      Mərubət nə-bo be

Chapter 9Verb morphologyVerb morphology in Tulil is more complex than the morphology of other word
classes. Verb inflection67 involves mainly prefixing, including A/SA person/tense
prefixes (cf.§9.1.2) and reduplication (imperfective aspect) (cf.§9.1.3). Deriva-
tional processes include the formation of M-stem, applicative suffix -m (cf.§9.1.4)
and incorporation (cf.§9.1.5). The morphophonological pattern of verb inflection
in Tulil is not immediately transparent, and will be discussed in §9.3.","[321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329]"

Chapter 1Introduction1.1 Overview of the Tulil speakers and the languageThe Tulil language is spoken on the island of New Britain of Papua New Guinea. It
is spoken by approximately 2000 people as of year 2000 according to Ethnologue
(Simons & Fennig, 2017), spreading over four villages (Tulil 1, Tulil 2, Kadaulung
and Toma). The Tulil people are referred to by their neighbours as ‘Taulil’, and
‘Tulil’ is the name they call themselves. The Butam people also live among the
Tulil people, and none of them is known to possess knowledge of the Butam lan-
guage that has to be considered extinct, after the last speaker died in 1938 (Laufer,
1959a).
    According to the oral history being passed on among the Tulil people1 , Tulils,
as well as Butams, both migrated from New Ireland Island long time ago, before
the Tolais’ arrival. According to this oral history, Tulils departed from Namatanai,
and landed in New Britain from Ataliklikun Bay in Epelik (named after a lady who
died during the process of migration), in between the Keravat river and Tivanakot
river, and gradually moved inland. Butams, on the other hand, departed from Siar
and landed from the east where the Varangoi river meets the sea. The two groups
later became one during an era of constant tribal fights with Tolais and Bainings,
and since then live in the ‘buffer area’ between these two big ethnic groups. It is
reported that the Butam group was wiped out after constant raids from the nearby
tribes in 1880s, and a few survivors sought protection from the Tulil and since then
living among them (Parkinson, 2010:75).
    The majority of the Tulil ethnic group is residing in Tulil 1 and Tulil 2, in a
narrow area between the Tolais in Rapitok, and the Bainings in Gaulim. There is
no clear geographic boundary between the two villages, and the division may only
be an administrative one: Tulil 1 is based on Protestant institution and Tulil 2 on
Catholic one. Except for these two villages, a few families live in Toma with the

changably with complement preceding NPs (375) and pronouns based on NP class,
such as von SG.CLF:DIM (376). However, bem can be complemented by personal
pronouns and the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun tang (377), while be cannot. be can
precede personal pronouns inside NPs, when the personal pronoun is modified by
a relative clause:  (378)   və-m∼ume            ngang be     ta to [ ta-ti∼vi            bərtəm

6.2. CLASSIFICATION OF PREPOSITIONS                                               207    In 377a, we can see that the form bemə with a schwa precedes the 2SG pro-
noun nging. The form bemə is used before all personal pronouns starting with the
phoneme /ng/. Also in 376, the first be is in fact bem, where /m/ assimilates to the
following pronoun and change /β/ to /b/ (details of the relevant morphophological
rules can be found in §2.5.2).
    Because type I prepositions do not take personal pronouns as complement, we
cannot see an alternation between a type I preposition cliticized with a patientive
marking =a and without, as the type II prepositions. Interestingly, most type I
prepositions end with the phoneme /a/ (ba ‘in’, da ‘on’, ga ‘at a crossing’, etc). The
form of their corresponding type II prepositions may suggest their original forms:
for instance, da has the derivative form dəm rather than dam, and vəda has the de-
rivative vədəm. Also, spatial adverbial expressions derived from prepositions show
the same fact. For instance, tədə latu ‘TO=on garden’ meaning ‘work on garden’
(§6.7). adverbs However, because the forms without the patientive marking =a is
never used for type I prepositions, they will be glossed only as one lexeme in this
grammar (eg. as vəda rather than vəd =PAT).
    Complements in 3rd person neuter can be dropped with some type II prepos-
itions, leaving the preposition stranded. For instance in 379, u-vi 3N-PROXS ‘this
thing’ is the implied complement for the preposition bem, and is omitted after the
preposition.  (379)    u-vi     o   nga-nəngar    bem pədəm.
           3N-PROXS TOP 1SG.NPST-talk about later
           ‘As for this, I will talk about it later.’                   [KM-TH-081]   Also, bem can occur by itself without a complement (be cannot). This happens
when the complement is mentioned elsewhere (380a) or indicated in the main
clause as related to a complement clause where bem occurs (380b). In both cases,
the implied complement has to belong to the 3rd person neutral gender (such as
matme in 380b).  (380) a. kori nga-nəngar  bem.

adverbially, when no apparent candidate of a complement is inside the clause,
such as the use of bərodəm ‘inside’ in the following example:  (382)   bə= kori go    ioi   nə-mu      bərodəm. b=   idə-təv

11.1.2 CoordinatorsIn a coordinate construction, the coordinator usually occurs between the coordin-
ands, syntactically closer to the coordinand that follows it (“A co-B”), due to two
reasons:    (A) The natural intonation break is before the coordinator (so does punctu-
        ation, when the speakers write);
    (B) Coordinators such as me ‘and’, məie ‘but’ can introduce a sentence while
        occurring in sentence-initial positions, forming an elliptical structure, where
        the first coordinand is recoverable from the context; and functioning as a
        conversation starter (708, 709).

   In (708), the woman has already asked her husband exactly the same ques-

While in (709), the quoted question intends to add more understanding about the
mountain that “we” have already talked about, which is the question, “do people
go up there?” In both cases, the coordinators are conversation starters that build
connection to the former contexts.
   There is no clear boundary between membership of the coordinator category,
and other linking elements belonging to the preposition or adverb categories. Co-
ordinators in Tulil typically include me ‘and’, ba ‘or’, məie ‘but’. Other conjunctions
involved in expressing coordination include discourse connective (io ‘and then, so’)
and topicalizer o.","[385, 386]"

                 The two high vowels /i/ and /u/ have allophones [ɪ] and [ʊ] in close syllables:
                             
                              [ɪ] / closed syllable

                              [i] / elsewhere

                 (8) /u/ →
                               [u] / elsewhere
   Schwa is comparatively weak in Tulil. For instance, /ə/ between stops/fricatives
and liquid is often shortened or deleted in fast speech:                 (9) ‘scratch’ /kəri/ > [kʰəri] ∼ [kʰə̌ri] ∼ [kʰri]
                     ‘pierce’ /vəlok/ > [vəlok] ∼ [və̌lok] ∼ [vlok]
24                                                             CHAPTER 2. PHONOLOGY    Also, /ə/ is often deleted when combining with another vowel during suffix-
ation/encliticization (cf. §2.5.1). And there are certain cases where /ə/ can be
deleted or inserted between consonants (cf. §2.5.2).
    These facts may suggest that schwa has limited distribution and may be epen-
thetic historically, however, its occurrence is not fully predictable synchronically
(cf. Blevins & Pawley, 2010; Evans & Miller, 2016). For instance, the ending schwa
cannot be predicted by word class or phonological contexts: e.g. near minimal pairs
məgunə v. ‘swallow’ and gun v. ‘count’; vətə v. ‘fish in creek’ n. ‘protein’, pət v.
‘break’ and vət class marking meaning ‘one segment of’.
    Vowels seldom occur word-initially: 1) initial high vowels /i/ and /u/ are ana-
lyzed as approximants /j/ and /w/; 2) /a/ mostly occurs as initials when it is the
affixal article (cf. §4.2), or person prefix; or initial of particles such as ar ‘still’; 3)
/ə/ never occurs word-initially; 4) /o/ occurs once as initial oraorong ‘big noise’,
and on its own as the topic marker o; 5) /e/ occurs as person prefix.
    (Near-)Minimal pairs of vowels occurring in interconsonantal and final positions
are shown in Table 2.6.
Table 2.6: Vowel (near-)minimal pairs                  Interconsonantal        Final     a            /tar/ ‘stick.into’      /ba/ ‘in’

     e            /ter/ ‘dig.out’         /be/ ‘at’
     i            /tir/ ‘ask’             /bi/ ‘where’
     o            /tor/ ‘wood’            /bo/ ‘up’
     u            /tur/ ‘wash’            /bu/ ‘heart’
2.2.2 Vowel combinationTulil avoids identical vowel sequences on the surface, and two vowels of the same
quality usually merge into one in surface realization, given that there is no observ-
able length difference between a single and a double vowel. This phonological rule
does not only apply word internally (affixation), but also between words inside a
phrase (cliticization), and in fast speech across word boundaries.
    This process is commonly observed in 1) patientive marking =a PAT and bor-
rowing article a- ART of the following noun; 2) noun class marking =a SG.CLF:MASC
and =e SG.CLF:FEM with the index of the following demonstrative a- 3SG.M- and
e- 3SG.F-.
2.2. VOWEL INVENTORY                                                                       25  (10) a. PAT =a + ART a- >a
         b. CLF:MASC =a + ART.M a- >a
         c. CLF:FEM =e + ART.F e- >e    Another hiatus resolution rule that is phonological involves the vowel /ə/,
which is always comparatively weak. The combination of [ə] with other vow-
els is not found in the data, and /ə/ is always lost in the process of affixation and
cliticization when combining with other vowels. This type of hiatus always arises
when verbs ending in vowels combine with 1) the patientive marking =a (11a),
as well as 2) the O/SO pronouns starting with vowels such as =e 3SG.F.PAT (11b).  (11) a.         telə ‘search’ + =a PAT >tel=a
         b.       mərkatə ‘leave.behind’ + =e 3SG.F.PAT >mərkat=e    All other vowel combinations exist in surface realizations in Tulil, as shown in
Table 2.7. /i/ and /u/ are analyzed as approximant /j/ and /w/ in word initial,
syllable medial and coda positions (§2.3), such as iaia /jaja/ ‘grandpa’. Based on
the stress pattern, and phonotactic considerations, only /ai/ can be analyzed as a
real diphthong in Tulil.","[55, 56, 57]"

be seen in Figure 2.6 and that of a non-verbal clause is shown in Figure 2.7. In the
first sentence, the highest pitch is the beginning of the verb (person index), and a
smaller peak at the beginning of the particle konəng ‘only’. In the second one, the
highest peak is the subject ttia ‘dad’ and another rise when the second NP occurs.
The general tendency of the pitch contours of both sentences are falling towards
the end of the utterance.

1.6 The dataThe corpus which forms the basis of this description of Tulil was mostly collected by
myself during nine months of field work in Papua New Guinea from November to
December, 2012 and from January to September 2014. Out of these nine months I
spent the whole time in Tulil village 1/2, and a couple of days in Kadaulung village
with the Butam descendents. The language description presented in this thesis is
based on the dialect spoken in Tulil village 1/2. Up to this stage, few dialectal
variations have been noticed of the Tulil language as a whole. In addition to that,
recordings collected by Schneider (transcribed by me and informants) were also
incorporated into the corpus and used as material for the analysis of this grammar.
    I recorded about 21.5 hours of texts (both audio and video) in total, from 40
different speakers (25 male, 15 female), ranging in age from 14 to about 82. The
description presented in this grammar is based on about 13.5 hours of these re-
cordings which are transcribed and translated in Elan10 . They comprise mostly
narratives and procedural texts. There are also some conversations, songs and
stimulus-based elicitation. Other types of recorded material such as community
meetings and classroom interactions are not yet transcribed and thus were not in-
cluded.
    The recorded material is supplemented by field notes of elicitation sessions and
participant observation. In addition to that, I used the following wordlist, ques-
tionnaires and stimuli: Swadesh list (207 items), Dahl’s questionnaire on tense and
aspect categories (Dahl 1985), BowPed topological stimulus (Bowerman & Peder-
son, 1992), each with one male and one female speakers.
    A lexical database in Toolbox format based on this corpus consists of about 1286
entries at present.
    I worked with 6 informants on transcribing and elicitation (each worked for dif-
ferent period/length of times): Donald Puongo, Elsie Evan, Kalistus Luaina, Louis
Gulua, Maria Rikie, Wenzel Mogor (in alphabetic order).
    The writing of this grammar is mainly based on the basic descriptive framework,
and does not explicitly commit to on any specific theoretical frameworks.10. https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, The Language Archive,

14   CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
Chapter 2PhonologySimilar to what is observed for most Papuan languages (Foley, 1986:48-64), the
phonological system in Tulil is relatively straightforward and simple. This chapter
begins with a description of the phoneme system and phonetic realization of seg-
ments (consonants §2.1, vowels §2.2) and phonotactics (§2.3). The following sec-
tion on suprasegmental features (§2.4) briefly describes stress assignment, with
instrumental analyses of sentential intonation. Other morphophonological pro-
cesses (such as affix interactions and morphophonemic alternations) are described
in Section §2.5. In §2.6 a brief description of loanword adaptation is given.
   Some acoustic analyses are given throughout the chapter: the analyses of indi-
vidual phonemes are mostly based on a Swadesh list collected from two speakers:
LG (Luisa Gulua, female) and DP (Donald Puongo, male), and the sentence ex-
amples are extracted from the texts.","[45, 46, 47]"

1.4 Previous work on TulilPrevious published materials on Tulil involve German missionary Carl Laufer’s pa-
per (1950), introducing the people of Tulil and presenting a brief grammatical
sketch. This paper was partially based on data collected by earlier missionary
Futscher, and after the publication of the paper, Futscher’s original notes were pub-
lished by Laufer as a micro-film (Futscher, 1959; Laufer, 1959b). The microfilm

    SIL researchers Lindrud and Nicholson worked on the language in 1981, com-
piled a note on sound system, several pages of example sentences, and a wordlist
(Lindrud & Nicholson, n.d). In 2002, Stebbins worked with a Tulil speaker who had
intermarried into the Baining group and the outcome was a wordlist, and gram-
matical notes. Cindy Schneider also collected several texts (comprising 51mins of
recordings). Tulil language consultant Louise Gulua and Maria Rickie collected
several stories from the speakers, and compiled a story book, with no recordings.

summary of Futscher’s work (Laufer, 1959a), comprising around 200 words and a
brief grammar sketch. Butam is no longer spoken and the last speaker died in 1938.
According to Laufer, this speaker’s language ability is in doubt, and the accuracy
of the information provided can not be guaranteed.","[39, 40, 41]"
"9.1.3 ReduplicationIn Tulil, reduplication in verbs can be seen as an inflectional process, expressing
aspect: the language marks imperfective, in contrast with perfective, by reduplic-
ation of the verb stems. In both NPST (622) and PST (623) tense, verbs can be
inflected as imperfective (words marked by underlines).  (622)    i-to∼bokbok          tuk udu da    d-a∼matme          da

morpheme may have a tendency to be reanalyzed as part of these verbs. For in-
stance, the stative intransitive verb lət(n) ‘arrive’ never occurs by itself without the
applicative n: lət cannot take an argument by itself, and an applicative n always
precedes the subject:  (629)    io  [ lət   n    ]VC =a   p∼pən      i-to a-Siapan.

           ‘Then the war of the Japanese arrived.’                         [JK-PP-006]   However, when the verb root is modified by an adverbial, the applicative n still
occurs after the adverbial:  (630)    [ lət    kup      n    ]VC =a   molimoli=ta       da

of the verb or not. However, the tendency of the applicative marking being part
of the verb is shown clearly by the existence of the allomorph -m (similar to nə,
mə is a phonologically conditions allomorph, occurring before consonants) of the
applicative suffix. For instance, the stative intransitive verb lang(m) ‘want’ has a
behavior similar to lət(n): firstly, the morpheme lang cannot take an argument by
itself (631a); secondly, when modified by an adverbial, the verb root can occur
by itself without the applicative suffix -m, but has to take the applicative particle
nə at the end of the VC (631b). However, lang(m) differs from lət(n) in that the
applicative can be marked twice in the clause as a suffix inside the verb and a
particle inside the VC, when modified (631c). This suggests that the applicative
marking shows a tendency to be reanalyzed as part of the verbs.  (631) a. lang-mə   ngang da nga-natme     nga         go

Except lang(m) ‘want’, the other ones are all intransitive verb roots (transitive when
occurring with applicative), including pən(m) ‘hit; kill’, mun(m) ‘pierce.through’,
mong(mə) ‘have sex’, tan(m) ‘copulate’(examples shown in 632 to 636). The latter
two words each only occurs once in the corpus, and the speaker reported that
they can be used intransitively. These words show m as a possible allomorph of
n when occurring after nasals. The allomorph m of applicative morpheme only
occurs within the verbs. Thus in (632) the applicative n after təng ‘put.on’ does not
show the same allomorphy after /ŋ/ (the reason why it is not outside VC will be
discussed in the following section), as ‘lang-mə’.

(vi), near hearer (bət), and away from both (mu). An additional parameter of vis-
ibility is combined with the distal distance (umu, glossed as DIST.INVS, possibly
derived from mu). Because the distance to the addressee is relevant, it is called
a person-oriented system according to Anderson & Keenan (1985:282-286), in
contrast to the distance-oriented system, where ‘middle’ term refers to a location
in medial distance relative to the deictic center, and make a distinction among
PROXIMAL, MEDIAL and DISTAL.

senario, where the deictic centre shifts between the two people, and two different
demonstratives are used for pointing at the same referent (‘the small chickens’).
The referents were close to B when he was chasing them, so they were addressed

sign (‘whistling’ sound) indicating the vicinity of the devil woman. That is to say,
they haven’t seen her but predict that she is approaching, thus they use e-umu to
refer to her.

ings are not totally exclusive of each other: in a sentence where movement is
involved and the second meaning is activated, CONTINUOUS has a connotation of
emphasizing the far distance of the destination, and END-POINT shows the destin-
ation is relatively close, and every step of movement is also of short distance.
    How the manner of movement differs for the two types of stems can be illus-
trated by the following two examples:

the manner of the movement. The difference is that in 490, ‘we’ were moving
continuously for a long distance, and in 491, the ‘two children’ were engaging in
some activities along the way, thus the END-POINT stem is used here.

to prepositional phrase (cf. §6.6), adverbial demonstratives and other type of ad-
juncts that indicate location or time. Both clitics can be combined with all types
of adverbial demonstratives (including interrogative nə-bi), and when combining
with demonstratives, the allomorph təkə is used rather than tə. Examples can be

used as arguments of verbs or adjoined to a coreferential noun in apposition (see
S5.1.2). The co-occurrence of nominals and nominal demonstratives has two types
of word orders: the noun (the core nominal) preceding the demonstrative, and the
nominal following the demonstrative, as shown in the following two examples:  (493)   it-nə∼nakun    nandi     io   a-kul=vitəm

postnominal demonstrative semantically modifies the core NP in an appositional
NP, while in 494, the prenominal demonstrative is in fact an NP itself and apposed
to another NP, as the semantic head (as in 495). In the second structure, the nom-
inal demonstrative is modified by an NP to provide more specific information to
identify the referent. Example 496 shows a case where the two uses co-occur.

specificational and clarificational function, generally in two respects: 1) when a
referent that is presumably not familiar to the hearer is introduced, as a specific
entity that needs to be explained further (as shown above in 494); 2) identify
one referent that was already mentioned in the discourse, when more than one
possibility exists (contrastive anaphora) (497). In the first case, only vi can be
used, while in the second case, most demonstratives can occur in the structure.

7.2.2 Demonstratives as indentifier/locationalPredicative demonstratives are those that occur in verbal clauses (locative clause,
§3.2.2.4). There are three types of meanings related to a predicative demonstrative:
1) identify the referent, as in English ‘This is...’ (498); 2) indicate a location, which
can fill out different roles in different event types, such as is location (where a
referent is found, 499), goal (500), path (501). The determination of the specific
interpretation is context-based.  (498)    doto məgəte molimoli=a         to a-ti∼vi            nogət n

food.
   In the use of the predicative demonstrative as describing a motion, the stem is
sometimes the reduplicated form (501, see §7.1.1.2 for details). Though indicating
a type of event in this case, no formal distinction can be identified between the
dynamic use and the static use (the same person index is used for both non-past
and past event, compare 500 and 502), thus it is taken as a type of dynamic reading
expressed by a verbless construction (cf. Västi & Kittilä 2016).  (501)    go    vəti=von       o   du-m∼bo,       təkə=nə-bo

navonbət ‘like that’ (shortened form nanbət) are derivative forms of the two stems
vi ‘close to speaker’ and bət ‘close to hearer’. The bases are the nominal demon-
stratives that are inflected for the diminutive nominal class (CLF:DIM).           stem               nominal (CLF:DIM) manner adverbial             short form

           bət ‘close to H’   vonbət ‘that (one)’   na-vonbət ‘like.that’    nanbət    The form of the manner adverbial demonstratives with the morpheme na- has
likely developed from the structure applicative/instrumental n + patientive a +
nominal demonstrative vodi/vonbət.
    The functions expressed by these two forms can be either exophoric or en-
dophoric. When used exophorically, they can refer to a manner, way or action.
navondi/nandi ‘like this’ refers to something that is being shown by the speaker by
action or gesture (510a); navonbət/nanbət refers to something related to the action
of the listener (510b).

    On the other hand, the two forms can be used to refer to a manner, way or
action that is endophoric. navondi/nandi refers to something that was immedi-
ately mentioned (in the same utterance) or is just about to be mentioned in the
discourse (511a); navonbət/nanbət refers to something that was mentioned earlier
in the discourse (511b).

   Specifically, they can refer to a piece of direct speech: navondi/nandi is used to
refer to something that is about to be said (preceding the direct speech) (512a);
and navonbət/nanbət is used to refer to something that has just been said (following
the direct speech) (512b).

been said (‘it is like this/that’). navodi/nandi is usually used at the end of a prosodic
unit (513a); and navonbət/nanbət is used at the beginning of a prosodic unit. This
kind of usage is more common in older people’s speech (513b).  (513) a. ava v-əngar         at-e,      ‘ava ngu-pi      təgət.’ navodi.

poral meaning ‘now’33 . Depends on the context, the distinction can be either clear
or ambiguous. Similar words also exist in other categories, such as demonstratives
nəbət ‘there, that time’.
   Manner adverbs modify verbs and directly follow a verb inside a verb complex,
before the post-verbal arguments. Also, the valency of the verb complex is de-
creased when a manner adverb is present, and an applicative particle n(ə) needs
to precede the argument.","[131, 132]"

3.4.4 PossessionPredicative possession can be classified into two types depending on the topicality
of the possessor and possessed NPs: indefinite predicative possession (when the
possessor NP is the topic, with a meaning such as ‘someone has something’) and
definite predicative possession (when the possessed NP is the topic, with a meaning
such as ‘something belongs to someone’) (Stassen, 2009:28).
    In Tulil, indefinite predicative possession is encoded by verbal or non-verbal
strategies in two types of construction:
    1) verbal (locative clause). The subject NP is an adnominal possessive construc-
tion, with the possessive pronoun and the non-specific pronoun go ‘some’. The
predicate is a demonstrative with person index, indicating existence.  (137)   bə= du           go    vətə laik=a          a-bət,

          ‘We will have big meat, a big eel.’                          [AK-FH-012]    2) Non-verbal: type I nominal clause, using an NP of adnominal possessive con-
struction as an existential predicate.  (138)   da   ta          go    venang    mə=nə-bət.

          ‘They want something from there.’                            [JK-PP-065]   3) a topic-comment construction with the possessor as the topic and the pos-
sessee as the comment, usually accompanied by locational adjuncts.

AcknowledgementsThis grammar literally would not have been possible without many people who
supported me along the way intellectually, materially and emotionally.
    First of all, my thanks go to all the Tulil speakers who welcomed me into the
community, allowed my participation in daily lives and cultural events, and taught
me about their language. I thank them especially for pardoning my ignorance and
lack of awareness in the social contexts. And I would like to express my special
gratitude to the people who actively participated in this study, either as language
consultants, or story tellers, whose names will be listed in the introduction part
of this thesis, and the text table. mərek vəvat bətmə ngən! I dedicate this thesis
and my sincere remembrance to my iaia (‘grandpa’) Ludwick Rickie, who I briefly
met during my first field trip and recorded many materials with; whose profound
knowledge of the language, culture and history of Tulil did not get a chance to be
fully captured before he died. ngattən təbemə nging.
    I would like to thank the many teachers who have inspired, encouraged and sup-
ported the research and writing of this thesis. First, I would like to acknowledge
my supervisor, Stefan Schnell, who gave the most advice throughout the forming
of this work, by reading through it many times with careful eyes. His attitude of
serious academic pursuit always inspires me. Secondly, I would like to thank my
other supervisor, Stephen Morey, for carefully reading and comments on the final
draft of the thesis, and being always helpful and available for administrative as-
sistance. I also want to thank Tonya Stebbins and Birgit Hellwig, who made this
research possible in the first place, by providing help and suggestion for the applic-
ation of my PhD, supervised me for the first two years of my study, and advised in
all practical matters that are fieldwork-related, without whom the fieldwork would
not possibly have been as smooth as it was. Birgit also read and commented on
the grammar when it was a sketch and various sections of this grammar later after
she left La Trobe University. Also, I would like to thank the various teachers in
ANU and Leiden University, who brought me into the world of linguistics and ini-
tially got me interested in this field in general, as well as the languages and culture
of Papua New Guinea, especially Felix Ameka, Nick Evans and Avery Andrews,
amongst others.                                         xxiii

dents in La Trobe University. Thank you all for the tolerance and acceptance of
me being a quirky and somehow socially retarded person. I am especially grateful
to Daniel Arisawa and Tamami Arisawa, for being supportive in life and as col-
leagues. Also, I would like to thank my friend Xuefeng Zhao, for academic-related
discussions throughout the years, and for translating some German texts for my
reference of this thesis. I am very grateful to my friend Xun Gong, for his friend-
ship, for providing various kinds of support during my whole PhD, my fieldwork
and helpful comments on several aspects of this grammar. mərimərit bətmə nging

and the free translation are in single quotes (‘’). Ungrammatical forms are marked
by asterisks (*).
   Glossed examples in this grammar follow the glossing conventions suggested
by Lehmann (2004) and the Leipzig Glossing Rules (Comrie et al., 2015). Each
example consists of at least four lines, and an example is shown:    L1: orthographic representation of the utterance, separated into morphemes
        (italics);
    L2: interlinear morphemic glossing;
    L3: a free translation into English in single quotation marks (‘’), with reference
        number in square brackets.

   The morphology of conjunctions can be complex or simplex. For instance, doto,
tove, kati, dame seem to be historically related to simplex forms of particles (e.g.
doto = do ‘here/now’ + to SR), though the meaning is semantically opaque.
4.11.2 bə iamitive perfectThe iamitive perfect proclitic bə occur before most types of elements to add as-
pectual connotations. It can have scope over clauses (examples in 281), and phrase-

verbials, examples in 282). When preceding elements starting with vowels, the
allomorph b is used, such as idə 3N.PST (281a) (but not semi-vowels /j/ (i) or /w/
(u), e.g. b before i- 3SG.F.PST but not iu-/ju/ 2DL.NPST). However, bə can be occa-
sionally found to be used instead of b (such as in 281b, compare with 283), this may
relate to the scope of the particle, or pragmatic functions, and further investigation
needs to be carried out on this issue.

    bə can be used with both dynamic and stative predicates with a similar use
to that of English ‘already’ (the term ‘iamitive’ derives from Latin iam meaning
‘already’). The semantic connotations differ when bə occurs with different
tense/aspect categories.","[192, 193, 194, 195]"
"3.2.2.4 Locative clausesIn a locative clause, demonstratives, prepositions and some locational adverbs
function as the predicate and can take a person index, and express locational,
possessive and existential meaning. The person indexes used with demonstrat-
ives/prepositions are ‘defective paradigms’ with no tense distinction28 (paradigms
can be found in §4.7.6 and §4.7.7). Clauses with some particles (such as quotative
e, directionals mən ‘from’ and tə(kə) ‘to’) preceded by special non-tensed person
indexes are also classified into this type.
28. Baining language may have a similar strategy: in the description of Mali-Baining, Stebbins differentiates
between ‘active’ verbless clause and ‘stative’ verbless clause, where demonstratives are considered to be ‘active’
because it requires indexing pattern similar to active intransitive verbal clause, with a different paradigm,
expressing existence, possession and location (Stebbins, 2011:48-49).

ing on whether a post-PRED argument is present. Table 3.2 shows the transitivity
of locative clauses with different types of predicates. Similar to the structure of
transitive or active intransitive verbal clauses, either a subject (no topicalizer o,
91a) or a topic (with topicalizer o, 91b) can be present in the clause (when the
clause expresses existential meaning, no o is present).","[105, 106]"

liu can be used to modify almost all demonstratives except vi ‘close to speaker’.

7.3 Semantics of demonstratives in spatial referencingThe main function of demonstratives in Tulil is to specify the location of a referent
in relation to the deictic centre (519a). The location can be and quite frequently
further specified with a modifying PP (519b).

    Demonstratives can also be used to describe motions (directions). It is less
likely for nominal demonstratives to be used for directions, but predicative (520)
and adverbial demonstratives (521) are quite often used for these functions. If
occurring together in a clause, directional adverbial demonstratives are placed to
the right of the static adverbial demonstratives, and they are not modified by PPs.

              ‘When they see her from New Ireland in the sea, they see an island they
              think it is an island moving down there inside the sea, then it comes back

movement, which is further specified by the PP ba viuve ‘in the sea’, while nəmə de-
scribes the direction of the movement. In the second part of the sentence, mə=nəmə
is also indicating the source of the movement, thus also a position, with an adverb
nuvəde ‘to here, this way’ specifying the direction.
    In the same sense, in (520), the predicative demonstrative a-mbo indicates the
action of moving (‘he was going up’), rather than the position (‘he was up there’).
Also the position of the destination is not specified. However, the latter meaning
can be expressed by the same construction. The deictic centre can be either the
speaker, or another location in the discourse.
    In Tulil, there are several sub-domains of spatial meaning: distance, interiority,
vertical axis, front-back axis and landforms (Table 7.4). The first four sub-domains
are generally involved in small-scale spaces that are closer, or more accessible57 to
57. The concept of accessibility is necessary due to the modern technology such as mobile phone. It creates
circumstances in which the speaker and hearer are far away from each other, but accessible. For instance, if

away from the deictic centre.
    We can see from Table 7.4 that the demonstrative stems can have more than
one sense in relation to the different sub-domains: for instance, -mu can be used
as distance (‘far from both speaker and hearer’), interiority (‘inside’) and landform
(‘inland’). In this case, the first sense is likely to be the original meaning.
    In Table 7.4, the most likely original meaning of each demonstrative stem is
noted in bold, and the other senses are the extended meanings. We can see that
demonstrative stems with their original meanings fall into the ‘distance’ and ‘ver-
tical’ categories are usually morphologically simple, while the stems of landform
expressions are usually derived (cf. §7.1).
    Although they tend to be used in different situations, the semantic parameters
are not totally independent. The demonstratives are chosen according to which of
the parameters (distance, vertical, interiority and landform) are the most relevant
one to the discourse, in the perception of the speaker.
    For instance, the following two examples describe the same spatial relationship
of ‘a body’/‘bones’ and a pit on the ground where they are in. However, two
different demonstratives are used: mu ‘inside’ (interiority) in the first case, and mə
‘down’ (vertical) in the second.   (522)      du-mu       mat idə nandi, ava du-liu             idə təkə=nə-mu

7.3. SEMANTICS OF DEMONSTRATIVES IN SPATIAL REFERENCING                                        261    In 522, mu ‘inside’ is used to emphasize that the ‘bones’ are inside the hole, in
contrast with the concept of ‘outside’ as the deictic centre that is set up by ‘our’
position. In 523, mə is used in contrast with bo to describe a movement from ‘down’
in the pit to ‘up’ at the side of the pit.
    A basic account of the functional system underlying the use of demonstratives is
outlined in this section, though more systematic research in spatial deixis is needed
for detailed description.","[287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293]"

2.4.2.2                  QuestionsThe pitch range is generally higher in questions, especially in polar questions. We
can see the frame of pitch in Figure 2.6 to 2.8c is 60-240Hz for declarative sen-
tences, while for polar questions it is 120-300Hz (Figure 2.11), in order to position
the pitch figures in the middle of the frame.
   For constituent questions, there is a slight rise-falling pattern on the question
word, otherwise the general tendency of the sentence is falling, similar to declarat-
ive sentences. Figure 2.9 shows a constituent question with the question word

   Intonation is the only cue to distinguish a declarative sentence from a polar
question. Polar questions (Figure 2.11) also show a steep rise and fall on the last
word of the utterance, where the rising may form the highest peak of the whole
sentence, and the falling end point is still higher compared to other part of the
utterance, differing from both declaratives and constituent questions, where the
end point of the sentence always shows a low point in the whole sentence.
   If the question offers alternatives, as in Figure 2.12, there is usually a peak on
the first alternative, and falling towards the end of the utterance.","[60, 61, 62, 63]"

4.7.5 Possessive indexesPossessive indexes are phonological clitics (clitics for inalienable but not for alien-
able) that precede the possessees, indicating the person, number and noun class of
the possessor nouns. Possessive indexes are compulsory in an NP-internal possess-
ive construction. The possessor can also be denoted by an optional NP. The full set
of forms of possessive indexes can be found in §10.1.2.2, while the use of them in
possessive construction can be found in §5.8. There are two sets of possessive in-
dexes: inalienable possessive indexes, and alienable possessive indexes. The nouns
associated with each group are discussed in §4.2.4.

to ‘of’, and one for the other prepositions (including the comitative n) (forms of both
can be found in §10.1.2.3). The person indexes of to ‘of’ index the possessee NP
before to, and the posseesee NP is optional if it can be retrieved from the context.

people want to say ‘you two go first’, they use it-nogət with the person index it
rather than iu-nogət with the person index iu. The reason is that the person indexes
for nogət is not tensed and iu for either past or non-past event, and it has a tendency
to be used as real verb, where the 2nd person plural prefix for future tense is it.
But even in the ‘correct’ usage, it-nogət still makes sense because the same form it
is used as the 3rd person dual index.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180]"

3.2.1.1 Person indexingA/SA arguments are indexed on the verb by pronominal prefixes, specifying the
person, number, gender of the argument, as well as tense (tense is lacking in some

distinguishing past (PST) and non-past (NPST) (see §10.1.2.1 for all the forms).
   Person indexes are obligatory on verbs, while NPs as the indexed arguments
are optional if they are recoverable from the context. As shown in the following
examples, the verb mume ‘tell’ is preceded by a full NP as the A argument in 66b,
but not in 66a; while in both sentences, person indexes are present:     (66) a. və∼mume             ngun at-e…

ments). Thus the person indexes in transitive impersonal clauses only represent
the tense of the predicate, but not person or gender. In example 68, the transitive
impersonal verb tu ‘become.fat’ are used with both the PST and NPST forms of the
person marking.

11.2.1.1 Symmetrical conjunctionThe conjunctive construction can be symmetric, which means the coordinands can
be reversed without a change of meaning. Conjunction of phrases is only found to
be symmetric, while conjunction of clauses can be either symmetric or asymmetric.
   Symmetrical conjunctions are expressed by means of juxtaposition or coordin-
ator me, and the latter is most commonly used. Juxtaposition of phrases is always
symmetric, however, juxtaposition of clauses are commonly temporal/consecutive
(will be discussed later).   (720)      da   nga-nume       bem =a   a-moli     mukəm.magərung,

   Verbs that can be used in intransitive impersonal clauses can always occur in
transitive impersonal constructions (a full list of impersonal verbs can be found in
§4.3.2).
    The restricted use of imperfective aspect in impersonal clauses suggests time sta-
bility and the unprototypical status of the impersonal clauses, though a distinction
in tense (PST vs. NPST) still remains. However, a tendency to lose this distinction
can sometimes be observed as well in the intransitive impersonals. For instance,
the word mang ‘pungent; burning’, when used in a setting which took place in the
past, can sometimes use the NPST grammatical tense (85b and 85c).

3.2.2.2   Stative-intransitive clauseTulil shows split intransitivity and has two types of intransitive clauses: active
intransitive and stative intransitive clause. The predicate of a stative intransitive
clause is a VC commonly taking either stative verbs (86a) or adjectives (86b) as the
head (cf. distinction of verb and adjective in §4.4). The stative intransitive verb
is not prefixed by A/SA person marking, and the sole argument S in this clause is
placed after the verb, and marked by the patientive case marker a or realized by
the patientive pronominals.

verb mat ‘get’ (see VC structure §8).
    Special cases of stative intransitive clauses involve predicates headed by PPs
(87) or adverbial demonstratives with directional proclitics mən ‘from’, where an
applicative n is always included in the VC. The structure is verbal because the pro-
noun following n (for instance, =a 3SG.M.PAT in 88b) is the patientive pronominal
form, and the patientive marking =a precedes an NP argument (88a). However,
this structure shares properties with non-verbal clauses with PP/adverbial as pre-
dicate. A detailed comparison is given in §3.3.3.  (87)    ngang o ba anguək        nə   ngang.

lexicon of the language, and clear cases of members belonging to this class is rare.
Also, patientive case marking is not strong enough a key feature to identify a split
intransitive pattern, given that all non-A arguments take this case (for instance,
the complement of prepositions). However, there are two reasons to acknowledge
that the language has a phenomenon of split intransitivity, rather than analyzing
the stative-intransitives as predicative adjectives and attributing the contrast in the
morphosyntactic encoding of arguments to a split in argument encoding of verbal
and non-verbal clauses (cf. Danielsen & Granadillo 2008).
72                                             CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE    First of all, morphosyntactic criteria to build a stative-intransitive verb class are
clear, especially 1) the applicative suffix mə that is unlikely to occur in adjectives;
2) the serial verbs mat that is unlikely to follow adjectives. These two criteria
lead one to believe that there is at least two undoubtful members of the stative-
intransitive class: lang-m(ə) ‘want’ (though most of the time m is separable from
the stem, and only one example shows the m is reanalyzed as part of the verb, see
§9.1.4 for the analysis of this morpheme) and məle ‘rest’ (which can cooccur with
mat and form a serial verb construction, see §8.4.3.1).
    Secondly, a diachronically possible connection between split intransitivity and a
‘transimpersonal’ construction is discussed by various papers included in Donohue
& Wichmann (2008) (such as Holton, 2008; Malchukov, 2008; Mithun, 2008). In
these studies, it is suggested that split intransitivity may develop as the result of
the reanalysis of transimpersonal constructions, which include a dummy subject,
and a referential argument encoded like the P argument.
    In Tulil, transitive impersonal constructions differ from full transitive clauses
in the limitation of person / aspect (the former only use the imperfective aspect
and 3rd neuter person). Functionally, transitive impersonals differ from stative-
intransitive constructions in showing the tense distinction of past and non-past,
though impersonals may have a tendency of losing this distinction (see §3.2.2.1).
   There is no evidence that any of the stative-intransitives in the current usage
of Tulil actually derived from the impersonal verbs, but it reveals the fact that
the morpho-syntactic alignment in Tulil could be semantically based; namely, the
sole-argument following the stative-intransitive verb and marked with patientive
case in many instances a less agentive/involved roles, but more affected/volatile
than a ‘property possessor’, when the latter is more likely to be expressed by an
NP. For instance, in the following examples, the possessor of ‘brain’ and ‘legs’ take
the semantic roles of ‘experiencers’.

In Tulil, the recipient of the ditransitive verb is coded like the P argument of a
monotransitive verb, and the oblique argument (the theme) is marked differently
with double marking (90a). It is primarily marked by the instrumental preposition
n (it has the same form as the applicative and the comitative). Also, like P argu-
ments, the oblique arguments take patientive case, either marked by the patientive
marker, or has a patientive form of a personal pronoun.   (90) a. a-tuk           ta n     =a   nangə.

this type of construction, the recipient of ‘give’ can occur after the theme (90b), or
after an adjunct (90c) and marked by the prepositional use of tuk ‘RECIP’.","[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]"
"6.2     Classification of prepositionsPrepositions in Tulil can be roughly categorized into four groups according to their
morphosyntactic characteristics: type I (§6.3), type II (§6.4), composite preposi-
tional (phrases) (this section) and prepositions of shared categories (§6.5).
    The two main classes of prepositions – type I and type II prepositions are
differentiated according to the type of complements they take, summarized in Table
6.1. We can see that type II prepositions can take all kinds of complements, while
type I cannot take personal pronouns and REFL/RECP pronouns as complements.
This is illustrated by type I preposition be ‘at; about’ and type II preposition bem
‘about’ in the following examples (detailed discussion of the two prepositions can
be found in §6.3.2 and §6.4.1.1):Table 6.1: Distribution of Type I and II prepositions            head of complements (NPs)                   Type I       Type II         personal pronouns (eg. nging 2SG)                ×            
  NP-class-based pronouns (eg. von SG.CLF:DIM)                        
             REFL/RECP pronouns tang                      ×            

        occur with particle like konəng ‘only’            ×            
    Morphologically, type I prepositions include many unanalyzable forms that are
associated with basic topological relationships, such as ba ‘in’, be ‘at’, da ‘on’, ga
‘at a crossing’, etc; while type II prepositions are mostly (but not all) derivatives by
suffixation of the morpheme m (or rarely, n), with an allomorph mə(or nə) in front
of ng (if the ending phoneme of the root is a vowel), or in front of all consonants
(this only works for m, when the ending phoneme of the root is a consonant).
Details can be found in §2.5.2).                      

    Bases of type II prepositions can be type I prepositions (for instance, as shown
in the above examples bem and be ‘about’, also, vəda and vədəm ‘for’. Type II pre-
positions sometimes but not necessarily have semantic uses similar to the type I
they correspond to. Also, type II prepositions can be derived from member from
other word classes, such as adverbs, nouns, verbs or unrecognizable elements (that
may be a lexical item historically) (Table 6.2).","[236, 237]"

   Locative clauses can also have PPs as predicates. Only one preposition (to ‘be-
long to’) always occurs in a verbal clause and requires the person index preceding
the preposition, expressing possession:     (92)    ror=a                 a-vi        o   a-to     nga

present, the clause is verbal; when there is no person index, it is non-verbal. Both
cases where a PP occurs as the predicate are rare (especially verbal, which occurs
in elicitation but seldom in texts). A more common case to express location is a
clause with a demonstrative as the predicate (either verbal or non-verbal), with PP
as a modifier.

as indefinite. In this case the topicalizer o is never present. Another way of ex-
pressing existential meaning is the nominal clause, usually as a simple NP without
topic (see §3.3.2).

Tulil are grammatically ambiguous: in addition to the function of a predicate in a
verbal clause, they also function as pronominals (e.g. avi ‘this one here; he’), or
nominal modifiers (e.g. molimolia avi ‘this man’). Thus structures with a substant-
ive demonstrative form are usually syntactically ambiguous (Table 3.3). A locative
clause (verbal demonstrative) can have alternative analysis as equative (pronom-
inal demonstrative). For instance, 91b can also be ‘My home is that one (inland)’,
and the example in 101 can also mean ‘her kids are here...’. In both cases, the
contexts disambiguate the meaning.  (101)   i=               vil=vənik               o   ta-vi,

possible to think of the two analyses as two readings of the same structure; another
reason is verbal demonstratives are different from (pro)nominal ones in that they
can be preceded by first/second person indexes (cf. §7.2.2):  (102)   nga-vi    konəng to nga-no∼mətor    konəng.

can have either an existential (verbal demonstrative) or identificational (pronom-
inal demonstrative) reading. For instance, example 100 can be understood as ‘those
two up there are two coconut trees’. Because the topicalizer o is never present in a
locative clause when the subject is indefinite, the nominal modifier analysis of the
demonstrative is also possible, thus a sentence like 103 can have various analysis,
as shown in Table 3.3:

dicates, while in 104c / 104d, the clauses are nominal clauses with NPs formed by
pronominal demonstratives as predicates. In 104e, the demonstrative is a modifier
and forms a whole NP with the core NP ləvək=a. A special case is that in 104d, the
pronominal demonstrative is a postposed subject (emphatic), and the NP ‘banana’
is the predicate. We can notice that when the first NP (subject in a/b/c, predic-
ate in d) is indefinite, the topicalizer o cannot be placed between the NP and the
demonstrative.

ferent types of prepositions, see §6.2). Examples of a typical PP can be seen in the

between a preposition and its complement NP. In this case, an applicative n also
has to be inserted before the NP. This is a special type of PP that 1) only functions
as predicates (either verbal or non-verbal), but not as adjuncts (so it is a property
of the predicate rather than the PP itself); 2) can only include Type II prepositions

an adjunct within an NP, modifying the noun məngəd=a ‘village’. The PP consisting
of this NP and the preposition ba ‘in’ is an adjunct of the verbal predicate led by the
verb pi ‘go’. Both of these two PPs are accompanied by adverbial demonstratives,
while the third PP be Valirua ‘at Valirua’ is an adjunct by itself.
    In addition to functioning as adjuncts in verbal clauses and NPs, PPs can also be
non-verbal predicates:  (372)    nang=e          e-bət       to tat-e        tor=e

           ‘That tree they called ‘the wood’ is at Palakukur.’            [JK-CB-010]   In atypical but not uncommon cases, a preposition can be used as a verb-like
predicate and take person indexes. In this case, the NP complement functions as
the argument. The person indexes that attach to prepositions differ from those
with verbs: there is no tense distinction in preposition person indexes (see §4.7.7),
while for verbs there are two sets (NPST vs PST). Thus when prepositions function
as verb-like predicate, the clause does not differentiate tense.  (373)    du-p∼pi,        du-ba      a-rot,   io   du-vən-m         =a

in many ways like a verb: 1) both can be encliticized by a patientive marking =a
when necessary; 2) both need an applicative marking nə before the argument if

and take a person index. However, prepositions differ in the degree to which they
resemble verbs, and can be classified into different types accordingly.","[233, 234, 235, 236]"

7.1.1.2   End-point and continuous stemsThe two demonstrative stems bo ‘up’ and mə ‘down’ can be affixed to form two
types of stems: p-STEM ‘end-point’ and m-STEM ‘continuous’, meaning ‘rather close;
moving and stopping’ and ‘very far; continuous moving’ respectively.

   The underlying form of the prefixed /p/ and /m/ in both forms can be seen as
two types of phonological doubling, where /p/ is the result of the following bil-
abial feature (of both /b/ and /m/) copied onto a [+STOP] element, and /m/ is
the result of gemination (/bb/ realized as [mb] due to prenasalization of voiced
stops, §2.1.1). There is an iconic component in the formation of these two forms.
Firstly, /m/ in the continuous m-STEM is often elongated symbolically to represent
an extension of space/distance. Secondly, the Mali Baining language also has a dis-
tinction between ‘terminal end point’ terms and ‘general direction with no terminal
end point’ (Stebbins, 2005:201-203), and the ‘terminal end point’ terms have the
forms of the ‘non-terminal forms’ plus a final stop /k/, /p/ or /t/:

types of demonstrative forms:

3.4.5.1 ExistentialType I nominal clause consisting of a bare NP is usually existential, stating existence
of something. The predicate can be a core NP, or pronominal, such as a pronominal
demonstrative:

when the subject NP is interpreted as indefinite. The clauses shown have alternat-
ive readings as locational, when the subjects NP have definite interpretation (e.g.
‘That man is around here’ in 148b). This type of existential expression differs from
the nominal type in that it usually encode locational information.     (148) a. a-kar   a-bət!

loosely attached to the clause, in contrast with ‘complement’, which is considered
to be obligatory in a clause structure. Adjuncts are distinguished mainly on a
semantic basis. They include semantic categories as spatial-temporal, manner pur-
pose, reason, condition.
   The common structures used as adjuncts are PPs, adverbials including adverbs,
adverbial demonstratives, and adverbial clauses. Adjuncts tend to occur towards
the end of the clause, or in the topic position, and it is possible to stack multiple
adjuncts. Manner adverbs differ from other adjuncts in that they directly follows
the verb inside a verb complex.","[129, 130, 131]"
