"These two clauses have a highly marked structure. Because in both clauses
the left-dislocated NP refers to the object of the clause, this is not the regular
fronting of re-activated constituents discussed in section V.3.1. Further in-
stances of left-dislocation can be observed in examples IV.297b), IV.298b),
V.30 and V.100b), some of them with S constituents dislocated to the left.
378                                Chapter V.7V.7.2 Negation
Negation is pragmatically marked in the sense that it asserts that “some
event, situation or state of affairs does not hold” (T. Payne, 1997, p. 282).
For a thorough treatment of this aspect of Majang grammar, see Unseth
(1994). The Majang language uses a fully inflectable auxiliary k- (see sec-
tion IV.3.5) for creating negative sentences in conjunction with the negative
verbal nouns introduced in section IV.2.2.1.
The negative auxiliary takes the place of the verb in the clause, whereas the
lexical negative verb form follows later as a complement to the auxiliary
predication.
Example V.85: negative auxiliary and negative verb
  a) nɛ kìr cɛːnà gájɛːL òláːtL bàŋɛ.

IV.3.8.1 Pragmatic particles
Pragmatic particles are used by the speaker to interact with other speech-act
participants. The following is a list of pragmatic particles identified in
Majang.
In Majang agreement is expressed with the affirmative particle ǐː.
Example IV.289: affirmative particle ǐː
   ǐː líkí mɛlɛ cìnɛːŋ.
   ǐː     líkí     mɛl-ɛ      cì-n-ɛ=ŋ
   yes correct arrive-3S.DJ DEM-SG-HR=SFT
   Yes, right, that is clear.
There is no particle in Majang that takes the function of English ‘no’.
The particle ánɛ expresses the doubt of the speaker to something said previ-
ously:

   Really, how can it be the end?","[328, 329]"
"Although this sentence has some morphological complications, such as the
use of a serial-verb construction to express an associated motion, and the use
                       Pragmatically Marked Structures                     375of the dative to express possession on a kinship noun, the sentence does not
deviate from the basic clause configuration. The verb is directly followed by
an absolutive noun phrase, and therefore none of the pragmatic markings
provided by the language are in evidence. The verb appears in the conjoint
form, indicating that the P is non-topical, and no sentence-final topicality
marker is placed. The constituent order is in compliance with the canonical
VAP of Majang.
Other pragmatically relevant features are also set to the default: the sentence
is affirmative, and therefore has no negative morphology. It is a declarative
sentence, therefore there is no question morphology or sentence tone in-
volved, and also no imperative or jussive morphology is in evidence.
This section now presents the effects of any changes to this default prag-
matic setting: markings for individual constituents as topical or focus, nega-
tion, questions, and imperatives with jussives.","[380, 381]"
"There is also a negative existential form, which, just as the affirmative form
     L
làkɛ , is an impersonal verb form:
Example V.90: use of negative existential form
   ìɟáːg kɛːL cìnɔ̀ tɛmk ɛ kɛːL cìnɔ̀ dàràːjɛːk.

      REL-SG-DIST despise-IMPS=SUB
      There is no work that is small or despised.","[385, 386]"
"This negative copula works like affirmative copulas in that it stays the same
for all persons; it is further specified by a regular personal pronoun:
Example V.89: use of negative copula
   moko eːt àgàltL!
   moko eːt àgàltL
   COP\NEG 1S      thief\SG.ABS
   I am not a thief!",[385]
"Negative imperatives use the hortative particle kàt in front of a simple main-
clause verb form. This implies that kàt is not a negative auxiliary form, but
rather a negative hortative particle, filling the same slot as ìn and koL in ex-
ample IV.185. Otherwise one would expect the use of a negative verb form
following kàt.",[276]
"In this example, the auxiliary verb óːl ‘can’ is used in the negative form
     L
óːlɛː . This needs to be preceded by the negative auxiliary k-, which is in this
context used in its 1S form kà. Negative verb forms cannot be used without
such a preceding negative auxiliary.
It appears that the negative verb formation is based on the formation of infi-
nitives. For almost half of all the verbs in the sample, the form of the infini-
tive is identical in all respects to the negative form. This is particularly true
for most of the verbs forming their infinitive with the suffixes -ɛːt and -iːt.
All the verbs forming their infinitives with -iːt do the same for the negative
verb form. Of all the verbs forming their infinitive with -ɛːt, only nine do not
use this marker for the negative. One of these, with the infinitive làptɛːt ‘to
die’, uses the suffix -ànL for the negative làptànL. The other eight use the
suffix -iːt, which is regularly used for all ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs ending with the
detransitivizing marker -ɗiːL.
Example IV.117: negative forms of ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs with detransitivizing marker
   base stem           class                   infinitive negative        gloss

   moɗíːL                                             L
                       ɛ-class verb suffixes   moɗɛː       moɗíːtL       burn
The last two of these examples show high-toned base stems, which form
their infinitives regularly with -ɛːL. They, too, end their negative forms on
    L
-iːt , which copies the root tone and is followed by a floating L. It is difficult
to determine whether this is the same suffix as the -iːt of i-class verbs, or an-
other suffix -tL just used for the negative form. A suffix -tL is also used for
the six verbs using the durative stem extension -àː, such as rɔ̀ːríjàː ‘teach’, in-
finitive rɔ̀ːríjɔ̀nL, negative rɔ̀ːríjàːtL. Other high-toned negative -iːtL markers
are found on five a-class verbs, such as ɗegeger ‘agree’, infinitive ɗegeger,
negative ɗegegeríːt.
The verbs that form their infinitives with -ɛːL or -íːL (and that don’t pick the
same marker for the negative) have an almost identical negative form -ɛːɗ
                                                         Verbs                                 221(38 ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs) or -íːɗ (20 i-class verbs); the implosive is only dropped in
the absolutive form of the infinitive. If the implosive is not dropped, then the
final H is realized as a HL sequence. In any case, all other tones on the stem
are replaced by a H that spreads across the whole word.

In the same way, the suffix set -ànL/-ɔ̀nL is not only used for the infinitive,
but also for negative verbs, although in smaller numbers than the previously
mentioned suffixes. Only seven i-class verbs use it for the negative, whereas
the other eleven i-class verbs which use -ànL for the infinitive instead use -ɛːL
for the negative. Another 16 ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs use -ànL for both the infinitive and
the negative, and 14 more use -ɛːL for the negative. In the a-class, six verbs
use -ànL and its tonal varieties for both the infinitive and the negative, and
seven more use -ɛːL for the negative instead of -ànL. Among these are some
low-toned manifestations of the marker -ɛːL.

The marker -ɔ̀nL of the infinitive is applied for the negative with a slight
tonal variation as -ɔ̀n for nine a-class verbs. For ten more a-class verbs it is
222                                                    Chapter IV.2left tonally unchanged, while a few more choose different negative markers
such as -ɛːL or -ɛːt.

The tV-prefix infinitives almost all use similar forms for the negative, but
they often involve slight changes to the stem vowel or to the tone. The only
two tV-infinitives using a different marker are tegeɟL ‘to prepare’ with the
negative keːɟíːtL, and tɔ̀kɔ̀ɲL ‘to persuade’ with the negative kɔ̀ɲɛːɗ.

Only one negative verb form in the sample is completely unmarked, kolloɟ
‘whistle’, which is both the root and the negative form. Three verbs (two of
them verbs of perception using the same suffix -ntàL) use suppletive forms,
but these are different verbs from those which use suppletion for the infi-
nitive:

The infinitive and the negative forms can be derived from practically all verb
stems, and they lead to verbal nouns which are used in certain grammatical
contexts. These are, according to Comrie and Thompson (1985, p. 350ff),
action/state nominalizations. But, beyond these two forms, there are other
ways to derive nouns from verbs with a more lexicalized meaning, called
argument nominalizations by Comrie and Thompson. They (1985, pp. 351–
357) sub-categorize this kind of nominalization into a number of more de-
tailed types, such as agentive nominalization, objective nominalization, in-
strument nominalization, and locative nominalization. In Majang, there is no
one-to-one correlation between these nominalization types and any of the
various nominalization forms introduced in the following sections.","[226, 227, 228, 229]"
"Only for the 2nd person plural, the imperative form is used in the negative,
instead of the simple main clause verb form. Again, the negative hortative
particle is used:
Example IV.188: negative 2P imperatives
   kàt gàːlàkɛL kɛkàr!
   kàt          gàːlà-k-ɛL        kɛkàr
   HORT\NEG     forget-EXT-IMP.PL again
   Don’t forget again!",[277]
"If this example consisted just of a negative verb phrase, then one would ex-
pect the SFT-marker to be placed at the end of the sentence. But this can never
be done. Unseth (1989b, p. 111) therefore correctly assumes that the nega-
tive verb needs to be seen as a complement of the negative auxiliary. This
also fits its nature as a nominalization, which is quite often formally identical
to the infinitive.
Verbless predicates are negated by the use of a negative copula:
Example V.88: use of negative copula
   mókò ìɟáːgL cìnɔ̀ kómój òmóŋL ŋɔ̀nk dákɛːɗà.
   mókò ìɟáːgL          cì-n-ɔ̀    kómój       òmóŋL   ŋɔ̀nk   dákɛːɗà

   Work is not just of one kind.",[385]
"
IV.3.5 Auxiliaries
There are not many auxiliaries in the Majang language. Auxiliaries are
lexically empty verbs whose purpose is to provide the grammatical
information needed for another verb that comes in a reduced grammatical
shape, but that provides the semantic content to the proposition (T. Payne,
1997, p. 84).
The morpheme that fits this definition best is the negative auxiliary k- that is
needed to precede the negative verb forms introduced in section IV.2.2.1.
Whereas the negative verb form is unchanged for all persons, the subject
information is provided by the negative auxiliary.
The negative auxiliary, just like verbs, has different endings for the 1 st, 2nd
and 3rd person in the singular and plural:
314                                  Chapter IV.3Example IV.268: conjugation of the negative auxiliary
   1S kà pàːkkà        I am not hot
   2S kín pàːkkà       you are not hot
                              SG
   3S kí pàːkkà        it is not hot
   1P kíː pàːkkà       we are not hot
   2P kí *ːr pàːkkà    you are not hot
                              PL
   3P kír pàːkkà       they are not hot
Unseth (1989a, p. 119) recorded the negative marker as kù-, which is pro-
bably a dialectal variation that I did not encounter during my data collection.
Getachew (2014, p. 177ff) seems to have recorded the negative marker with-
out the vowel /ù/.
The negative auxiliary can undergo further inflection than just the bare per-
son suffixes seen above. It can appear with the impersonal marker:
Example IV.269: impersonal negative auxiliary
   máL tɛːnàn ɟéːmɛL kɛːL rɔ̀ːríjáːtìŋ.
   máL tɛːnàn     ɟéːmɛL         k-ɛːL  rɔ̀ːríjáːtìŋ
   but instead previously NEG-IMPS teach\NEG
   But they were not previously taught.
Furthermore, the negative auxiliary is also the carrier of any directional in-
flection marking:
Example IV.270: negative auxiliary with centripetal inflection
   kìːkíːL túːkɛːL ɟóːpL ɔ̀gɔ̀ wàlɛc.
   k-ìːk-í ,ːL túːk-ɛːL ɟóːpL        ɔ̀gɔ̀ wàlɛc
   NEG-CP-1P join-NEG people\ABS.MOD other from.outside
   We don’t join with other outside people.
The following are the negative auxiliaries with direction markings:

city to do something. It is inflected as an ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verb.
Example IV.273: auxiliary oːl ‘can’
   óːlùn típír à éːkeːr.
   óːl-ìn      tí-pír       à    éːk-eːr
   can-2S.CJ INF-fly\ABS.SG CONJ truth-PL.ABS
   You can truly fly!
As seen here, this auxiliary is followed by an infinitive verb form.
Furthermore there are a few verbs which can serve as full verbs in some con-
texts, but which can also serve as auxiliaries to other verbs, in order to pro-
vide modal or aktionsart information.
The first of these is the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verb ɗɛj with the meaning ‘want’ and ‘need’.
This is used to indicate deontic or optative mode to a proposition. If so, then
the other verb appears in the infinitive form:
Example IV.274: ɗɛj as an auxiliary
   a) ɔ̀kɔ̀n làkɛL ɟóːpL gɔ̀ ɗɛjɛr àmbàbɛːt, ...
      ɔ̀kɔ̀n làk-ɛL          ɟóːpL       gɔ̀      ɗɛj-ɛr     àmbàb-ɛːt

316                               Chapter IV.3The same lexeme is also used as a full transitive verb, with the desired object
in the P slot:

   ɗɛjɛrL màcáːpɛL nɛːk cìnǐŋ joː?

IV.2.1.3 Infinite verbs
There are two different infinite verb forms in Majang: infinitive and nega-
tive. For the majority of verbs these forms can be accomplished by adding a
productive suffix to the stem. These suffixes are presented in section
IV.2.2.1 Infinite verb forms below. Both forms are syntactically verbal
nouns, but at least the infinitive can still serve as the semantic predicate of a
subject or object clause (see examples IV.100 and V.121). The negative
form is quite restricted in its use, but the infinitive form has all the morpho-
logical characteristics of a noun, which means that it can be inflected for
number and case. Many nouns of the lexicon are in fact lexicalized infinitive
forms. Other nouns are derived from verbs by the use of some less produc-
tive nominalization devices provided by the Majang morphology; these often
result in lexicalized meanings, not as predictable as the ones gleaned from
the infinitive or negative verb forms.
212                             Chapter IV.2IV.2.2 Derivation processes for verbal roots
This section explores the derivation processes that operate on verbal roots. It
is not always easy in Majang to decide which verbal markings are to be seen
as derivational and which as inflectional. Nominalization is certainly a deri-
vational device, and the main-clause person marking is clearly inflection.
Other categories may be less clear, such as the impersonal marking or the
various direction forms found in Majang. For the former there are some
indications that place it firmly in the inflectional drawer; for the direction
markings things are less straightforward.
The following processes are described in this section as derivational, as they
produce new stems from verbal roots: nominalizations (with infinitives and
negative verbs), detransitivization, inceptive verbs, durative verbs, and two
more derivation devices with an unclear semantic interpretation. Further-
more, the formation of imperfective verb stems through reduplication makes
it profitable to treat this device in this section.","[217, 218]"
"The subject can also be placed following the negative verb form, as hap-
pened in example V.85a).
                          Pragmatically Marked Structures                   379The combination of negative auxiliary and negative verb does not create a
unified verb phrase; this can be concluded from the fact that the sentence-
final topicality marker is never used following a negative verb:
Example V.87: no SFT-marker following negative verb
   kíːL gájɛːL.
   k-íːL        gàj-ɛːL
   NEG-1P        succeed-NEG
   We don’t succeed.","[384, 385]"
"In both cases, the two questions do not differ in their order of constituents or
in any other morphological way from their affirmative counterparts. The
only difference is a sharply rising sentence tone at the end of the clause, as in
the following (stereo) pitch curve of example a):
                   Figure 10: pitch drawing of máL kɔ̀ːL èːt mó?",[389]

     My database contains about 55 clearly identified stative verbs.
278                                       Chapter IV.2Nominalizations
Nominalizations of stative verbs are comparatively rare. As shown, infini-
tives can only be created from stative verbs by using the suffix -kàː, which
replaces the root tone with a constant low tone in all cases.
Example IV.198: infinitives and negative forms based on stative verbs
      root         infinitive   negative       gloss
      àːj         àːjkàː     àːjkàː       being slow
      dɛː          dɛːkàː      dɛːkàː        being red
      ɗɔ̀m         ɗɔ̀mkàː     ɗɔ̀mkàː       being sharp
These nouns derived from stative verbs all follow the same inflectional num-
ber and case-marking paradigm, illustrated here by the stative verb méː ‘be
in pain’.
Example IV.199: case-marking paradigm of meːkàː being in pain
      SG.ABS              meːkàː         PL.ABS         meːkàːtàkL
                                          PL.ABS.MOD     meːkàːtàL
      SG.ERG              meːkàːt        PL.ERG         meːkàːtà
      SG.ERG/NOM.MOD      meːkàːL        PL.ERG/NOM.MOD meːkàːtà
                                                                    L
      SG.NOM              meːkàːtL       PL.NOM         meːkàːtàL
      SG.DAT              meːkàːtà100   PL.DAT         meːkàːtàkàL
      SG.LOC              meːkàːt        PL.LOC         meːkàːtàkɛL
      SG.LOC.MOD          meːkàːt
      SG.POSS             meːkàːtonk     PL.POSS          meːkàːtàkonk
Some stative verbs create abstract nouns by using the verbal derivation mar-
ker -Vːɗ (see section IV.2.2.6). The resulting stems always have a high tone,
although the stative-verb stems mostly have a low tone. The plural is formed
by adding the suffix -àkL.
Example IV.200: nominalizations of stative verbs with suffix -Vːɗ      root      gloss of root       NOMIN.SG        NOMIN.PL     gloss
      ŋàdí     angry               ŋádíːL          ŋádíːꜜɗàkL anger
      páːk      hot                 páːkáːL         páːkáːꜜɗàkL heat100
  My language consultants informed me about an apparent dialect difference regarding the
  singular non-central case stem, which looks as shown here, with a LH pattern, in the area
  around Teppi, but comes entirely low-toned in the Godare area.
                                        Verbs                                      279Adverbs derived from stative verbs
Adverbs can be derived from stative verbs in two productive ways. One way
is the use of the clause-internal conjunction à to introduce adverbial verbs or
stative verbs:
Example IV.201: adverbial elements from stative verbs using the conjunction à
   nɛ èːŋáɗír ɗùŋéɗL à jòwɛːɗíːŋ.
   nɛ    èːŋáɗ-ír      ɗùŋéɗL         à      jòwɛːɗ-iːL=ŋ
   CONJ smell-CF.3S     hyena\SG.ABS   CONJ   far-3S.DJ=SFT
   He smelled Hyena far away.
This is a rather syntactic way to create adverbial elements, and it also applies
to regular verbs. The result of this is not a new word category of adverbs, but
rather adjuncts that are used in an adverbial function. Syntactically, in spite
of the clause-internal conjunction, a second clause is added to the sentence.
This strategy is supplemented by a device of a more morphological nature,
the use of the infinitive of the stative verb in the locative case:
Example IV.202: adverbs from stative verbs using the locative infinitive -kàːt
   nɛ tàjɛ ɓànkàwkàːt.
   nɛ     tàj-ɛ       ɓànkàw-kàːt
   CONJ open-3S.DJ strong-INF.SG.LOC
   He opened (it) forcefully.
Although making use of grammatical means seen elsewhere in the language,
this device may rightfully be called a derivation; it creates a different word
category called adverbs. It can be used with all stative verbs, as in bɔ̀ːlàːkàːt
‘weakly’, gorgorkàːt ‘speedily’, àːjkàːt ‘slowly’, bàlàːkàːt ‘a little’, boːbkàːt
‘hugely’, ɓɔ̀ːkàːkàːt ‘abundantly’.","[283, 284, 285]"
"Example a) shows that some material can be placed between the auxiliary
and the negative verb, such as a dative pronoun. Interestingly, I have not en-
countered a single example where the subject appears between the auxiliary
and the negative verb. Unseth (1989b, p. 119) seems to have found such ex-
amples, however, so this is apparently a sporadic gap in my data and not a
structural one. My language consultants accept Unseth’s following example
as grammatical:
Example V.86: subject between negative auxiliary and negative verb
  kí kɔ̀ joːsep ɓokotíːt ɗɛpɛL.
  k-í       kɔ̀     joːsep       ɓokot-iːt   ɗɛpɛL
  NEG-3S RECPST      Joseph\NOM kill-NEG      lion\SG.ABS
  Joseph didn’t kill a lion.",[384]

Acknowledgements
I want to thank the following people for their contribution to this study:
The main language consultant for this study was Joseph Kalakun. In many of
the research sessions Joseph was supported by his colleagues of the Majang
Bible Translation Project, Hawariyat Babure, Epheson Teramaj, and, until
2011, Abyot Girma. This was graciously permitted by the Illubabor Bethel
Synod of the EECMY. James Kim and Gallo Aylate helped setting up the re-
search sessions. Furthermore, James and his wife Whashu shared their
knowledge and material on the Majang language.
Other Majang speakers contributing to this work were Yordanos Addisu,
Kadiree Nyamor, Nibeyat Dimesse, and Ashine Astin.
Tyler Schnoebelen generously shared his personally collected Majang Data
with me. Sandra Hufnagel transcribed most words of the Comparative Afri-
can Word List, initially supported by Stefanie Hauser.
Pete Unseth shared more data and analysis with me. He once intended to
write this very language description, and I am glad that he entrusted me with
completing this work.
I am grateful to Drs. Moges Yigezu and Getachew Anteneh for the ideas and
inspiration we shared with each other while working on the same language.
I benefited from practical help by various friends and colleagues. David Ford
spent hours editing sound files, and even more on proofreading. Seyoum
Berhe translated materials from Amharic to English. Tefera Endalew pro-
vided logistical help in Mizan Teferi. Other workers of the Bench-Maji MLE
project, particularly Efrem Belay, helped me immensely in later stages.
My doctoral supervisor Maarten Mous and co-promoter Constance Kutsch-
Lojenga gave good feedback on all parts of this study, and more came from
the committee members Gerrit Dimmendaal, Doris Payne, Jenneke van der
Wal and Maarten Kossmann. Further conversations I had with Mary Pearce,
Keith Snider, Helga Schröder, Colleen Ahland, Michael Ahland, Mike
Bryant, Joshua Smolders, Anne-Christie Hellenthal, Don Killian, Manuel
Otero, Mike Cahill, Roger Blench, and Tom Payne. More occasional advice
was given by numerous participants on the SIL Linguistics Discussion List.
Colin Davis created the language map on page 37. Anne-Christie Hellenthal
provided the Dutch Samenvatting at the end of this book.
14                          AcknowledgementsFunding was provided by my personal supporters, channeled through my
sending organization Wycliffe Germany. Wycliffe also provided an addition-
al grant for finalizing the research in 2016 (thanks to Martin Sauer). Other
funds came through an SIL project for languages in Western Ethiopia.
Finally, I want to express my warm gratitude to my wife Corinna, and to my
daughters Teresa and Sara.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

List of bound morphemes
The following is an alphabetic list of all bound morphemes of the Majang
language, as encountered in this work. V in a prefix stands for the first stem
vowel in a total vowel harmony context. In a suffix it refers to the class vow-
el of the verb (à, ɛ, or i). The following tonal conventions are used to refer to
the underlying tone of the morpheme:
          •   -i (no tone indicated): a toneless morpheme – the morpheme copies
              the previous tone.
          •   -í:, the morpheme takes the polar (opposite) tone of the previous

Introduction
      “Grammar and discourse interact with and influence each
      other in profound ways at all levels, so that in real life neither
      can even be accessed, not to mention explained, without refer-
      ence to the other.”
This statement by John Du Bois (2003, p. 49) may serve as a fitting tag-line
for this language description, which provides much justification to his idea.
The past few years of my attempts to first understand and then describe the
structure of the Majang language were deeply impacted by this interaction
between grammar and discourse. The project began with a tone workshop
under the guidance of Keith Snider and Constance Kutsch Lojenga in Addis
Ababa in 2008; there I became convinced that another description of the
Majang language would add value to the efforts of previous and contempo-
rary linguists, simply because my newly gained understanding of the tone
system would give me a considerable advantage that was not available to
them. With this confidence about tonal differences, I felt that I could open
doors into the inner systems of the grammar by identifying all the categories
that so far were not described by my colleagues.
I started by analyzing a substantial word list, and then worked on simple
narrative texts. They revealed that Majang had very little to offer in the way
of case marking, as most central constituents appeared to be unmarked for
case. After some time I started branching out from the texts by eliciting fur-
ther data, and this was the first time that it dawned on me that things might
become more complicated. The consultant at that time returned completely
unexpected tone patterns to me, both on verbs and nouns, so that after a few
days of this I falsely concluded that I could not trust his data and decided not
to work with him again. What is worse, I went through the data I collected
from him and corrected it to the way I thought it had to be, because it just
did not fit my assumptions.
Next then came another workshop, this time about grammar, which was
based entirely on elicited material gleaned from a number of motivated lan-
guage consultants. After a short time with these men it became very clear
that the Majang language had a surprise in store for me that I did not expect
to find in an African language – a full-blown ergative-absolutive alignment
system, probably the most robust specimen encountered so far in any lan-
guage on the continent. I went through my text corpus again to change all the
30                                 Introductionglosses according to this new discovery, correcting all the data where I must
have misheard things initially. Unfortunately, I ran into more and more diffi-
culties with this, as rather a lot of the early transcriptions did not quite fit the
new revelation.
Some elicited data finally made me aware that there must be some split sys-
tem regarding intransitive subjects. Often they came out with different cases
than the absolutive I expected, and I presented this as some kind of split-S or
fluid-S system at the 2015 Nilo-Saharan colloquium in Nairobi. Later, I
checked my data again and discovered what seemed closer to the truth, a
split-ergativity system based on the pragmatic parameter of topicality, which
fits very well into the framework provided by typologists (section III.2.1.2).
Then going through the tedious job of checking all the paradigms of nouns
encountered in my texts, I made the startling discovery that, with very few
exceptions, ergativity did not appear in any of the texts. I was looking at a
language with two faces – one with a vibrant ergative-absolutive nature
jumping at me from all my elicited grammar data, and another one stubborn-
ly aligned along nominative-accusative characteristics in my texts.
There are explanations for these two natures, grounded in the aforemention-
ed interaction between discourse and grammar. In the discussions that follow
I hope that I do this language justice. One thing I have learned in the process
of preparing this grammar: whatever the linguist finds out depends to a great
extent on the nature of the available data. Had I followed the advice of only
looking at data from natural texts, I would probably not have encountered
the ergative-absolutive nature of this language. Had I only restricted myself
to elicited data, I would not have realized how marginal the structures are in
the language, at least in the kinds of text that are usually analyzed by lingu-
ists. I am grateful that somehow I stumbled across the most felicitous mix.
This Majang grammar was written for linguists. This means that it is not par-
ticularly useful or even readable for those who want to learn the language, or
for linguistically untrained members of the Majang language community.
Other resources need to be (and hopefully will be) written for them. At least
it is my hope that this language description can serve as a resource for those
who will be creating such works of a less technical and more practical na-
ture. Reading this grammar requires a minimum of linguistic training, which
encompasses familiarity with the terms provided by what is called Basic
Linguistic Theory. This concept is now readily accessible in the three vol-
umes of the same name by Dixon (2010a, 2010b, 2012). Following the con-
                                  Introduction                                31cept of Basic Linguistic Theory entails the commitment to disregard any
particular contemporary grammatical theory or model in its current special-
ized terminology or formal representation, or to at least reduce it to a mini-
mum. The idea is that even in generations to come, linguists and typologists
will be able to make use of this description without having to first go
through a course on the intricacies of linguistics in the early 21 st century. I
hope to accomplish this goal by providing sufficient definitions for all ter-
minology that is not part of Basic Linguistic Theory, and by refraining from
any kind of formal representation that is not self-explanatory. Contemporary
readers who hope to find explanations and representations according to the
latest models will therefore be predictably disappointed. All in all, the focus
is mostly on description, and much less so on explanation.
For the most part, I also refrain from historical statements, and I take no part
in any discussion regarding the placement of Majang or any other higher-
level language family unit in any kind of genetic classification. Where the
presented data supports or contradicts any existing classification, I say so,
but without drawing any further conclusions.
This language description comes in several parts. The division into parts is
inspired by the ideas of both T. Payne (2006) and Noonan (2006), who en-
visioned the development of user-friendly grammars as coming from two
perspectives: one a form-to-function approach, and the other a function-to-
form approach. Although this division could not be upheld entirely, these
two approaches are reflected in Part IV: Morphology and Part V: Other
Syntactic and Pragmatic Topics of this language description. But I found it
necessary to add a third part preceding these two perspectives which deals
with the basic facts behind information packaging in the clause (Part III:
Basic Syntax). This is the shortest of the parts in this work, but it introduces
many of the concepts in both form and function that accompany the reader in
all the following sections. It also discusses my choices regarding analysis
and terminology, and explains why some alternative approaches were not
pursued in the interpretation of certain language structures. In a sense Part III
can be seen as the central chapter of the whole description.
Further elements necessary for a helpful language description are found in
the other parts. Part I: The Cultural, Ecological and Sociolinguistic Context
not only provides demographic, ethnographic and sociolinguistic informa-
tion on the Majang language and the people who speak it; it also gives de-
tails on sources and history of this study, and the people involved in it. It fur-
32                              Introductionther contains a short typological summary (section I.11) of the language.
Part II: Phonological Inventory and Orthography presents the findings of
the phonological analysis, which is an integral part of this study, together
with much of the data that underpins these findings. It also explains the par-
ticulars of the practical orthography used in this language description.
After the main grammar parts III-V, Part VI: Texts and Lexicon provides
two word lists, one from Majang to English and one from English to Majang,
to give an impression of the Majang lexicon. This is preceded by two sample
narrative texts, which show the language in natural use.
It is my sincere hope that the index provided at the end enhances the useful-
ness of the grammar to those who do not have the time to read this work
from beginning to end, since this usually describes the largest group of
grammar users.

Part I: The Cultural, Ecological and
Sociolinguistic ContextI.1 The Name of the LanguageThe Majang language, a Nilo-Saharan language spoken in southwest Ethio-
pia, has been given many names; see Dimmendaal (1998b, p. 26ff) for a list
of names of all Surmic languages. The following are the names listed there
for the Majang language: Ajo, Ato Majangeronk (self-name, means ‘mouth
of Majang people’), Mageno, Majangir, Majanjiro, Mezhenger, Masongo,
Mesengo, Ojang and Tama. As seen in section I.3.1, the variety of names has
led to some confusion regarding the 2007 Ethiopian census.
The only names applied to the Majang people nowadays are based on the
(closely related) variants Majang, Mesengo and Mezhenger. Since these are
different orthographic representations of the self-name, they do not cause
any offense to the Majang people. I am not aware of any derogatory names
currently applied to the Majang people.
In this study, I use the name Majang language, or, in short, Majang.
The ISO 639-3 code for Majang is mpe. WALS (Dryer & Haspelmath, 2013)
uses the code maj, and Glottolog1 the glottocode maja1242.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]"
"Further irrealis situations are negative clauses and imperatives/jussives,
which are treated in their respective sections V.7.2 and V.7.4.1. For these,

particular irrealis marking beyond the negative or imperative morphology.
One way in which the Majang language does show the irrealis nature of the
clause is the use of the clause combining conjunction ɛ. It is used instead of
the conjunction nɛ if two clauses are connected that are each either negative,
or the protasis of a conditional construction, or assumed future events.

Negative conditional clauses
Negative conditional clauses are protases which state that a condition is not
met. They usually also have a negative apodosis. In the following example
the rare situation is encountered where the protasis follows the apodosis.

"This negative protasis does not make use of the conjunction ɔ̀kɔ̀n ‘if’, but
begins with the conjunction cluster máL tɛːnàn ‘but instead’. Only the use of
the conditional clitic at the end of the clause makes it evident that this is
indeed a conditional clause; it cannot be an SFT-clitic, as such never follows a
negative verb.",[409]
"
Infinite verb forms
The Majang language makes use of two infinite verb forms; they are based
on verb roots, but not inflected for person, conjoint/disjoint, or relative tense.
Instead, they can be at least partially inflected like nouns. As their formation
is very closely linked with the formation of lexical nominalizations, it is as-
sumed that these forms are derivations from the verb. Semantically, the infi-
nitive and the negative verb forms can be analyzed as action nominalizations
(see section IV.2.2.1). Many of these verbal-noun formations use more or
less productive suffixation processes, but even where this is the case, other
changes to the stem are frequent.

nals, as they can still serve as predicates of subordinate clauses (see section
V.8.2.1). In the following example, the subject clause rɔ̀ːríjɔ̀nL nɛːkɛːk is
clearly marked as a subordinate clause by the subordinate-clause marker =k.
The predicate of this clause is the infinitive rɔ̀ːríjɔ̀nL ‘to teach’.

      nɛ rɔ̀ːríjɔ̀nL nɛːkɛːk òːɗǐːŋ.

  because what CONJ COP-NEG join-PURP.3S
  This is in order to not join...",[410]
"The negative purpose clause also uses the conjunction nɔ̀, followed by the
negative copula mó, and it uses the purpose marker on the verb.

A modal clause provides adverbial information about how the main-clause
action is performed. In Majang such clauses are introduced by the conjunc-
tion òkó cɛ, which consists of the preposition òkó ‘like’, followed by the
short demonstrative cɛ. The subordinate verb comes in the relative-past form.
Such clauses may be accompanied by the subordinate-clause marker =k.

IV.2.1.2 Finite verbs
The finite verb in Majang follows this template (Figure 9):
         Stem – Extension – Direction – Relative Tense – Referential Object –
                             Person (+ conjoint/disjoint)
                             Figure 9: affix template of finite verbsNone of the suffix slots are filled for all verbs. There are some zero allo-
morphs among the person morphemes, and the extension slot and the relative
tense slot are rarely used. Each verb could also be followed by various
clitics, such as the sentence-final topicality marker =ŋ or the subordinate-
clause marker =k. Any simple or derived stem may serve in the stem slot;
some means of derivation are introduced in section IV.2.2 below. The ex-
tension slot may contain the semantically empty suffix -k in front of some
person markers, but only in certain verb classes. It is inserted for phono-
logical reasons, and it never appears in the same verb with a relative tense
marker or a direction marker; therefore the relative order between these is
not relevant, except that the analysis proposed here sees the extension as an
extension of the stem. The direction slot follows the stem directly only for
81
     For the i-class, the 3S, 2P and the 3P forms are also defined by the class-vowel, but they are
     subject to the labial-harmony rule 4, which changes short /i/ to /ù/ for the verb lòw.
                                     Verbs                                    211two of the set of three direction markers, centripetal and centrifugal. The
deictic-transfer direction marker is regularly placed following any relative-
tense marker. The relative-tense slot is used for a few morphemes connect-
ing the verb to its pragmatic temporal setting, and only in subordinate
clauses. Although the referential-object suffix is identical to one of the
relative-tense forms, it does not fill the same slot, as it follows other relative-
tense suffixes.
Some person markings are characterized by tonal changes on the stem. The
person-marking suffixes themselves are portmanteau morphemes that also
carry the conjoint-disjoint distinction of the language. Conjoint forms indi-
cate that the immediately following NP in the absolutive case is non-topical.
In all other situations, the disjoint form is used (see section III.3 for informa-
tion on the use of this distinction).
Aspect is expressed through the choice of different verb stems, with the im-
perfective aspect using a reduplicated version of the perfective root.
Other grammatical categories often associated with verbs in other languages
are not expressed through inflectional categories on the verb in Majang: ab-
solute tense and modality use other means, such as free particles or auxiliary
verb constructions.","[216, 217]"
"Infinitives
Infinitives are formed using a variety of morphological means, but for the
most part on a predictable basis. Any prediction depends on the inflection
class of the verb, and its root tone. As verbal nouns, the infinitives can be in-
flected for number and case, although it is difficult to find plural examples in
a natural text.
The following major infinitive markers are used82: for many low-toned roots
of the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class and the i-class the infinitive marker -Vːt is chosen. Vː stands for
the class vowel /ɛː/ or /iː/; /ɛː/ undergoes height harmony rule 5, which turns
it into /eː/ following a final root syllable with a high vowel /i/ or /ù/. This suf-
fix is used as -ɛːt for almost 100 ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs (out of about 230) and as -iːt
for 17 i-class verbs (out of about 80). In all cases this suffix copies the low
tone of the root.

plural marked by -àkL with a stable high tone. A sample paradigm follows:

Most of the other low-toned roots of the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class and the i-class use the
marker -VːL, which is a truncated absolutive singular variety of the suffix
                              L                                                           L
-Vːɗ. This materializes as -ɛː for about 70 ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs, and as -íː for about
30 i-class verbs. Unlike the suffix -Vːt it does not copy the L of the stem, but
it superimposes a H across the whole infinitive word. It also causes a down-
step for any following word starting with a H. There is a certain ambiguity
about the length of this final vowel, which is often perceived by the speakers
as being short. But since the i-class variant does not undergo labial harmony
(which would result in korùL ‘to close’ in the example below), and because it
goes back to a long vowel in the suffixes -ɛːɗ and -iːɗ, it is assumed that the
vowels are long.

The suffixes -ɛːL/-iːL and -ɛːt/-iːt are also used for other, more lexicalized no-
minalizations (see the relevant section below). Infinitives using the markers
   L           L
-ɛː and the -iː are inflected for number and case according to the following
paradigm, with an unmarked singular and a plural marked by -àkL:

The stem of this noun is the infinitive ŋádíːɗ based on the i-class root ŋàd ‘be
angry’. This is shortened to ŋádíːL in the absolutive and in the modified erga-
tive/nominative forms.
The marker -ànL copies the tone of the stem, and causes a downstep to the
following word, if it begins with a high tone. It is the marker of choice for all
high-toned verb roots of the i-class (18 verbs) and most high-toned roots of
the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class (32 verbs). For the a-class (total sample of almost 90) it is used
for five verbs with a low root tone.
                                                                 L

Only once in the examined data this marker -ànL is used for a high-toned a-
class root. The infinitive ŋàrotowànL ‘to snore’ is therefore exceptional in
Majang. A handful of other verbs use the marker with a HL sequence, as in
toroːkàn ‘to trample (a-class)’, ɓɛːràn ‘to crush (a-class)’ or goːpàn ‘to punish
(i-class)’. Whenever this happens, the preceding stem vowel is long, but
there are other infinitives with the same environment which don’t have a fal-
ling tone. Four more a-class infinitives, eꜜjànL ‘to milk’, gíꜜjànL ‘to grind’,
       L                                 L
ɲeꜜjàn ‘to strain food’ and wɛːꜜŋàn ‘to breathe’, have high-toned suffixes
on the high-toned a-class roots ɛj, gíj, wɛːŋ and ɲej. The tone of the preced-
ing root is not copied, but the suffix has its own high tone, which is therefore
216                                  Chapter IV.2downstepped according to the morpheme-downstep rule. The infinitives with

The marker -ɔ̀nL is the infinitive suffix for a large group of a-class verbs,
regardless of which tone is found on the root. For high-toned roots (of which
there are 28 in the sample), this tone is always copied. The seven low-toned
roots using this marker replace all tones on the infinitive word with a H.

As shown below, the suffixes -ànL/-ɔ̀nL are not only used to form infinitives,
but also for other, more lexicalized nominalizations – but in those situations
the tonal pattern of the resulting nouns is quite different.
A total of 23 verbs of the sample (about 6%, all from the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class or the a-
class) use an entirely different and for the Majang language somewhat sur-
prising way to form infinitives. Instead of using any suffix, they use a prefix
based on the consonant /t/ and the reduplicated vowel of the root. Long root
vowels are shortened in the infinitive:
Example IV.109: infinitives formed with the tV-prefix   root          class                     infinitive   gloss
   kàːm         a                         tàkàmL     limp
   kɛg           a                         tɛgɛkL       pound
   kɔ̀ːw         a                         tɔ̀kɔ̀wL     dig
   pír          ɛ-class verb suffixes     típírL     fly
   rɔ̀g          ɛ-class verb suffixes     tɔ̀rɔ̀L      laugh
   kùɗ          ɛ-class verb suffixes     tùkùL      weep
All these infinitives have a low-toned root. Those of the a-class have their
infinitives with a LH tone melody, whereas the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class infinitives have a H
melody. There is no reason to assume that the prefix infinitives are in any
way functionally different from the suffix forms. The use of a prefix is very
unusual for Majang. The only other attested prefix is the very archaic and
unproductive causative prefix *i- identified by Unseth (1998, p. 116). The
prefix-formed infinitives are inflected according to the following paradigms:

Another set of 23 verbs of all three inflection classes uses the root without
any suffixes or prefixes for the infinitive. Of the i-class, all seven infinitives
entirely preserve the root. For ɛ-class verb suffixes- and a-class verbs, there are frequent tonal
and segmental changes to the verb root.

taches to low-toned roots, and replaces all tones on the word by a high tone.
The identity of the rhymes of all a-class verbs of this group is noteworthy.
Example IV.113: infinitives marked by -ínL   root      class   infinitive   gloss
   ɓàːr     a       ɓàːrínL    forbid

   ɗùŋkù   i       ɗùŋùnL     lie down
   mùr      i       mùrùnL     return
Four a-class verbs form their infinitive by adding the suffix -àL. It copies the
tone of the root.
Example IV.114: infinitives marked by -à   root      class   infinitive   gloss
   ɲɔ̀ːn     a       ɲɔ̀ːnàL     insult

   tím      a       tímà       wound
   tùːl     a       tùlà       shave
Yet another group of four verbs uses some kind of suppletion form for the
infinitive.

   kɛːɗ      a       ɛɲɛːL        go

   kùc      i       mɛlɛL        come
Negative verb forms
The negative verb forms are syntactically more restricted than the infinitive,
as they can only be used in the negative construction, where they are always
preceded by the negative auxiliary (see section IV.3.5). Therefore they
cannot be inflected like nouns, and accordingly are less nominal in character
than infinitives.

"The three examples display the forms of ‘mother’ for a first person (a), se-
cond person (b) and third person possessor (c). There is no unpossessed form
of mother in Majang. Example c) further illustrates a second characteristic of
kinship terms: if they are the head of a possessive NP, their possessor nouns
do not use the regular forms of the possessive (-konk or -k), but they use the
dative form. This trait of kinship terms was already carefully described by
Unseth (1992b, p. 99). Other examples of suppletive kinship forms are the
following:
Example IV.98: some other kinship nouns
            1st person       2nd person   3rd person

  sibling   dèːdéː           mácóːkòjL    máɲáLIV.2 VerbsVerbs in Majang are defined by their various syntactic and morphological
properties, which are different for finite and infinite verb forms. All verbs
can be used in a finite form with person marking, and all verbs can also be
used in the negative and infinitive forms, which are not marked for person.
These criteria, however, also apply to words denoting stative property con-
cepts, which morphologically are very similar to verbs. They are therefore
                                               Verbs                                              209treated as a sub-class of verbs in section IV.2.4, where they are called stative
verbs in line with the nomenclature applied to other Surmic languages.
Readers looking for the category of adjectives in Majang are therefore di-
rected to that section.
Finite verbs are characterized by their ability to serve as the predicate of a
clause, without the use of either a copula or a subject pronoun. More about
the use of verbs can be gleaned from sections V.3.2.2 and V.3.3.","[214, 215]"

V.7.1.1 Cleft constructions
Cleft constructions are not a frequently used device, at least based on the
sample of texts analyzed for this study. Only one affirmative cleft construc-
tion was encountered:

      ègè cìnì cìnɔ̀ pàːrírkúnɗɔ̀L dákɛɗàk.

      This is what you are only going to try.",[382]
"But even this is freely exchangeable with the regular 2P form:

"Example a) has the irrealis conjunction between two protasis clauses; in
example b) it is between two future clauses, and in example c) between two
negative clauses. As all these factors can be seen as providing an irrealis en-
vironment, the use of this different conjunction ɛ therefore seems to indicate
this change of mode.",[377]
"I.10 The CorpusThis section gives an overview of how this study came about, and how its
presentation is envisioned.
                                  The Corpus                                  43I.10.1 The nature of the research
The research conducted for this study was impacted by two main factors: the
requirements of the Leiden University Ph.D. program under which this dis-
sertation was developed, and the expectations I had to meet as a result of my
affiliation with SIL International, working in Ethiopia. Fortunately, both
were not set against each other, and there was a lot of helpful overlap. Still,
having to work in a full-time position resulted in the inevitable neglect this
study received over time, which means that it took much longer than this
kind of research is supposed to take. It also had the disadvantage that I was
not able to spend extended periods of time in the language area, and I did not
develop any active proficiency in the language.
In the Introduction, it was stated that this study is based on both elicited data
and natural texts, against Dixon’s advice (2010a, p. 321ff), who insists that a
grammar should always be based on natural data only, possibly augmented
by data from elicited paradigms to fill gaps. I believe that such a restriction
would have led to a poorer description of this language. I will explain in
section III.2.1.2 why there are good reasons not to expect a high number of
ergative forms in narrative or conversational discourse, which is exactly
what happened in the texts studied for this grammar. Not only was I forced
to elicit ergative structures by using contrived examples, I also had to go
through countless paradigms of both verbs and nouns in order to get a clear
identification of the forms found in the texts. Part IV: Morphology makes it
clear that it is not possible to just look at a verb or, particularly, a noun in
Majang to determine its syntactic status. For practically each noun encoun-
tered in a text, I had to collect a full number-case paradigm to be sure of
what particular form I was looking at, especially when it came to central-
case forms, and often even beyond that. Any hope that I would accumulate
sufficient knowledge of forms exclusively from natural texts would have
been totally unrealistic.
My corpus of well-analyzed texts contains 2879 words, availing me with
sufficient material to demonstrate the various structures of the language in
the sections that follow. It is balanced by many pages of elicited sentences
and paradigms. Occasionally I also draw on less well-analyzed texts for ex-
amples to illustrate a particular point.
The research began in 2008 with a phonetic transcription of the 1700-word
Comparative African Word List (CAWL, Snider & Roberts, 2004), which
was initially prepared for me in 2007 by two linguistics students, Sandra
44                                     Chapter I.10Hufnagel and Stefanie Hauser. This word list, arranged by semantic do-
mains, constituted the main source of information in the very early stages of
this research. Using this resource, I collected the singular-plural paradigm
for each noun, and the main-clause paradigms for all persons for each verb
encountered. It also served as the basis for the tone analysis conducted in
2008 at a tone workshop in Addis Ababa.
This tone workshop introduced me to the methodologies propagated by both
Constance Kutsch Lojenga and Keith Snider 4 and gave me an excellent set of
tools to formulate and test hypotheses. This was amplified by the qualities of
my language consultant during that workshop, Joseph Kalakun, who is a
good whistler and who compares the tone patterns of different utterances
with a high and well-deserved confidence.
A substantial amount of textual material was given to me by both James Kim
and Pete Unseth, who collected these texts years before. I picked some of
these texts, re-recorded them and applied my own transcription. This was ne-
cessary, as no tonal information was present in the old transcriptions, and
there was much uncertainty about vowel qualities and quantities. Two of
these texts are presented in section VI.1. Most texts were traditional narra-
tives, but I also analyzed a hortatory text written in the course of a discourse
workshop in the early 2000s, and I recorded a new spontaneous conversation
between the three main consultants, which provided me with structures not
encountered elsewhere in my corpus. Many of these appear as examples in
the following sections.
As I slowly discovered the various case forms of Majang, I devised diag-
nostic frames that I could apply to all nouns, and in this way I was able to
glean the various nominal paradigms presented in sections IV.1 and IV.2.2.1.
For verbs, I was easily able to collect paradigms about basic finite forms,
nominalizations, infinitives, negative forms, and direction forms. It was
more difficult to create appropriate frames for the subordinate-tense forms.
More and better research can and should be conducted on this, including the
other tense options, aspect and mode.
All texts, all lexical information and much of the grammar was entered into a
database running under the SIL Fieldworks software. For the phonological
analysis I used SIL Phonology Assistant, supported by both Praat and SIL
Speech Analyzer. Much of the paradigm analysis was facilitated by the help-
ful spreadsheet features of OpenOffice and LibreOffice.

"The alternation regarding the position of the verb apparently goes back to a
restriction that each clause needs to begin with either a conjunction or a
verb.
The only other material that can be analyzed as being part of the verb phrase
is the particle ɗeL, which is part of a few phrasal verbs: dòkú ɗéL ‘he sits
down’ or dùnkú ɗéL ‘he lies down’. This particle is always found immediate-
ly following the verb and is therefore apparently an integral part of the verb
phrase. It cannot be left-dislocated like tense markers or short pronouns.
338                             Chapter V.3V.3 Grammatical Relations in the Simple ClauseGrammatical relations are the way in which a language establishes formal re-
lationships between a predicate and the most important participants in a sim-
ple clause, based on the perspective the language has on the semantic and
pragmatic situation (T. Payne, 1997, p. 129ff). Each language’s grammar is
deeply impacted by the perspective the language takes. This is certainly the
case for the Majang language, which places a high emphasis on the pragma-
tic outlook of a proposition. It forces different case-marking strategies for
the most central participants.
This grammar does not intend to follow the terminology, even less the for-
malisms of any particular theory or model of grammar. It hopes to be still
useful and readable when all the models or theories of grammar fashionable
at the time of its production have long been cast aside by future generations
of linguists. But this does not mean that it ignores all contemporary thinking;
the early 21st century provides a wide variety of useful models to inform the
work of a descriptive linguist. Particularly the area of grammatical relations
requires that a grammarian discloses what perspective was adopted when
looking at the data.
The choice of terms such as predicate and participant in the preceding sec-
tions reveals that my perspective has been chiefly a functional one. I believe
that the concept of valence and the idea of the predicate frame, both well de-
veloped by Simon Dik (1989) in his Functional Grammar, provide simple
and insightful tools to describe what is going on in a clause, and my termino-
logy borrows heavily from Dik’s model. Slightly more modern influences on
my analysis of the Majang data come from Croft (2001), Dixon (2010a) and
VanValin & LaPolla (1997). The following terms are used in this section:
      •   Predicate: the central element of a clause, semantically defined by
          what is being said about the subject. The predicate slot of a clause
          may be filled by verbs, stative verbs, nouns, pronouns, quantifiers,
          even adverbs. Each different word category may require a different
          construction.
      •   Participant: a being or object involved in the semantic representa-
          tion of a clause. This participant may or may not be referred to by a
          noun phrase.
                Grammatical Relations in the Simple Clause                  339    •   A: the most agent-like participant in a transitive clause.
    •   P: the patient or undergoer of a transitive clause. The participant
        most affected by the action.
    •   S: the only central participant of an intransitive clause.
    •   Construction: a syntactic configuration resulting from the combina-
        tion of a particular predicate with particular participants in a particu-
        lar pragmatic setting.
The simple clauses in Majang are characterized by a surprising variety of
constructions, triggered by various factors to which the Majang syntax pays
particular attention. Some of these factors are of a syntactic nature. Other
factors make reference to the semantic and pragmatic makeup of the propo-
sition.
In this section various simple-clause constructions of Majang are presented.
They are introduced by stating the various parameters that influence these
constructions, followed by a listing of these constructions, showing how dif-
fering combinations of the listed parameters result in different clause con-
figurations.","[343, 344, 345]"
"
IV.3.9.2 Adverbial conjunction
In the Majang language many clause-level adverbials are not case-marked
noun phrases or prepositional phrases, but mini-clauses which consist of no
more than a verb, stative verb or numeral, and which are not treated as inde-
pendent clauses. They clearly are placed in the adverbial slot of the clause
and are introduced by the clause-internal conjunction à. These adverbials
have a very different status from the adverbial clauses presented in section
V.8.3. For example they can never precede the clause they belong to.

Part V: Other Syntactic and Pragmatic TopicsThis part of the language description deals with the use of the various forms
explored in the previous sections, focusing on what they accomplish mostly
from a functional perspective. Section V.1 investigates the structure of the
noun phrase, and section V.2 does the same for verb phrases. In section V.3,
the structure of the various kinds of simple clauses is presented, and section
V.4 surveys the semantic functions of various noun phrases. Sections V.5 to
V.6 briefly deal with further syntactic topics (valence-changing construc-
tions and tense, aspect and mode). Section V.7 lists a number of pragmatical-
ly marked structures, such as fronting, negation, questions, focus and imper-
atives. Section V.8 investigates the various ways to combine clauses to com-
plex sentences, and section V.9 addresses topics relating to topical continuity
and discontinuity.","[332, 333, 334, 335]"
"I.11 Typological OverviewThis section contains an overview of the basic typological facts about Ma-
jang for easy reference. The details of all these features should be read in
their respective passages in this language description.
Compared with other Surmic languages, Majang has a very small consonant
inventory with only 18 consonants, including two implosives /ɓ, ɗ/ (see sec-
48                             Chapter I.11tion II.2.1). The language provides no systematic opposition between stops,
fricatives and affricates – all these sounds can be subsumed under the single
label obstruents.
Majang has seven vowels (including two sets of mid vowels, see section
II.1.1), without ATR vowel harmony (section II.1.4). There is contrast be-
tween short and long vowels (section II.1.3). Important phonological rules of
Majang are labial harmony, which rounds the short vowel /i/ to /ù/ in verbal
suffixes following syllables containing round vowels or labial consonants,
and the morphologically restricted vowel-height harmony, which changes
the vowel /ɛ/ into /e/ following a high-vowel syllable (section II.5).
The tonal inventory consists of two tones plus downstep (section II.6). It can
be shown that some morphemes in Majang are inherently toneless, and that
another morpheme requires an analysis involving a polar tone. Many words
demonstrably end in a floating low tone (section II.6.3), which is often at-
tached to apparently toneless morphemes. Tone plays an extensive role, not
only in distinguishing lexical items, but also in the grammar of Majang.
The Majang morphology is predominantly agglutinative, with segmental af-
fixes containing individual bits of grammatical information (only suffixes
are productive, with two unproductive prefixes). Some grammatical features,
however, such as noun number and case, are indicated by stem changes or by
tonal means. Like most Eastern-Sudanic languages, Majang does not display
grammatical gender, but it provides a very diverse number- and case-mark-
ing system on nouns, with a large number of inflection classes (section
IV.1.3). Case marking is complicated by the provision of special forms for
modified nouns in some syntactic cases (section IV.1.3.2). Unlike other Sur-
mic languages, Majang has no distinction between inclusive and exclusive
forms of the first person plural of pronouns or verbs.
The language has a variety of personal pronouns for various functions. One
set of pronouns serves for general anaphoric reference, another for reference
inside the verb phrase, and a third for contrastive purposes (section
IV.3.1.1). Demonstratives and relative pronouns code a three-level deictic
system, with reference to either the speaker, the hearer, or a place away from
them both (sections IV.3.1.2, IV.3.1.3). Possessive pronouns indicate the
person of the possessor together with number reference to the possessed
entity (section IV.3.1.4). Interrogative pronouns always appear at the end of
the question.
                              Typological Overview                             49Many Majang verbs come in pairs of perfective and imperfective, where the
imperfective form is derived from the perfective form through partial redu-
plication (section IV.2.2.7). Furthermore, all verbs are inflected with subject
suffixes. Most verbs also distinguish between a tonal conjoint (CJ) form and a
disjoint (DJ) form; the conjoint form is only applied to verb phrases that are
immediately followed by a non-topical NP in the absolutive case (section
III.3). Another grammatical category frequently expressed on the verb is di-
rectionality, which comes in three values: centripetal (CP) forms, which
indicate a movement towards the deictic center; centrifugal (CF) forms, which
express a movement away from the deictic center; and deictic TransFer (TF)
forms, which are used for a movement from one deictic center to another
deictic center.
The basic order of constituents in Majang transitive clauses is VAP, where A
stands for the transitive agent and P for the transitive patient-like constituent,
usually the object. The order of constituents is fairly fixed in the language,
except for the option to front certain constituents (mostly subjects) for syn-
tactic and pragmatic reasons (section V.7.1).
Pragmatic factors indeed have a major influence on the syntax of Majang.
The case marking of central participants of a clause depends on their topical-
ity (section III.1). If they are not topical, S and P are marked by the same
absolutive case (examples a and b):
Example I.3: non-topical case marking of central constituents
   a) kàwɛ èːɟɛː wárL kɛkàr.
      kàw-ɛ      èːɟɛː        wárL     kɛkàr
      bite-3S.DJ cat\SG.ERG dog\SG.ABS again
      A cat bites a dog again.
   b) ɗegàr wàrL kɛkàr.
      ɗegàr       wàrL     kɛkàr
      sleep\3S.CJ dog\SG.ABS again
      A dog sleeps again.
   c) kàwɛ wàr íɗítL.
      kàw-ɛ      wàr         íɗítL
      bite-3S.DJ dog\SG.ERG   man\SG.ABS
      A dog bites a man.
50                                Chapter I.11The non-topical A, however, is marked by a different case, the ergative (ex-
ample I.3c). If topical, this A is marked by yet another case form, the nomi-
native, which is also used for a topical S:
Example I.4: topical case marking of central constituents
     a) ɗegàrL wàr kɛkàr.
        ɗegàrL      wàr      kɛkàr
        sleep\3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM again
        The dog sleeps again.
     b) kàwɛ wàr íɗítL.
        kàw-ɛ      wàr       íɗítL
        bite-3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM man\SG.ABS
        The dog bites a man.
The three different case forms of ‘dog’ – wàrL (ABS), wàr (ERG) and wàr (NOM)
– are only distinguished by tone, but different they are. Two more clause-
level cases are used by the Majang language, the dative (DAT) and the loca-
tive (LOC), plus a further possessive (POSS) case to mark nouns as possessors of
a noun phrase. A detailed discussion of the cases and their use is presented in
sections IV.1.3.2 and III.2.1.2.
Though the constituent order VAP is normal, the verb is often found at the
end of the sentence. In that situation, another morpheme is attached to the
verb, the sentence-final topicality marker =ŋ (SFT). This marker indicates
that the final constituent is either the verb phrase or a topical noun phrase
(see section III.4 for its discussion).
The language makes use of some valence-changing devices. Most notable
among those is the antipassive (AP) (section V.5.1). A genuine passive con-
struction in the sense of Dixon (2010a, p. 166) is not encountered in the lan-
guage – its function is partly covered by the impersonal form, an inflectional
device described in section IV.2.3.1.
In spite of Unseth’s (1989b, p. 106) claim to the contrary, Majang does not
have postpositions, and only a few questionable prepositions (section IV.3.6).
Relative clauses are very frequent in Majang, and can be both restrictive and
descriptive (section V.8.5). Some temporal adverbial clauses have subordi-
nate-tense verb forms (section V.8.3.1). Otherwise tense is only expressed
through tense markers which appear to be working along the lines of a
metrical tense system (section V.6.1.1).
                                                                           51
Part II: Phonological Inventory and
OrthographyThis section introduces the inventories of the Majang phonology – vowels,
consonants and suprasegmentals. It also displays the rules which govern the
use of the various elements of these inventories.
In this section, data presented without any kind of bracketing is understood
to be in its surface-phonemic representation, transcribed according to the
phoneme inventories shown in tables 1 and 3. Only when further phonetic
detail needs to be shown for greater clarity, phonetic data is supplemented in
square brackets […]. On the other hand, in some places information is given
about the individual morphemes making up a word. These are always shown
in their underlying representation, and the brackets {…} are used to sur-
round such lexical units. This is different from the other parts of this lan-
guage description, where the underlying representation is shown without
brackets.
Individual sounds are shown by /x/ to be phonemic, by [x] to be phonetic and
by <x> to be in orthographic representation.","[53, 54, 55, 56, 57]"

IV.2.1.1 Inflection classes
Each Majang verb belongs to one of three80 inflection classes, which in this
study are named according to the vowel of the second person plural suffix.
The a-class uses -à*r (e.g. ŋɔ̀ɗ-à*r ‘you abandon’), the i-class uses -í *ːr (e.g.
                                                   PLlow-í *ːr ‘you lead’), and the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class uses -ɛ*ːr (e.g. oɟok-ɛ*ːr ‘you shake’). For
                PL                                                                   PLthis reason the 2P form is used as the citation form of verbs in the word lists
in section VI.2. This is not to claim that Majang speakers would use this
form naturally as a citation form for verbs, but that this form is very useful to
identify the inflection class at first glance.
For the person-marking suffixes, the 2P form is not the only difference de-
pending on the inflection class. Often the defining vowel indicates other dif-
ferences, as the following paradigms for the conjoint forms illustrate:
80
     A fourth class, the u-class, is only used for stative verbs, and is therefore introduced in
     section IV.2.4.3.

      3P     ŋɔ̀ɗ-àr          low-ùr        oɟok-ɛrBeyond the person suffixes, the inflection class also influences the choice of
suffix-allomorphs for some other morphemes, such as the infinitive and the
negative form.
The a-class needs to be divided into various subclasses, due to differences in
behavior regarding the stems of the verbs. The details for this are given in
section IV.2.3, a-class verbs.","[215, 216]"

   (1968) *N/*K distinction.
54
   Countless infinitives and negative verb forms (see section IV.2.2.1) also use this marker, so
   this is really an open class with a lot more potential members.

In these examples the change between suffixes ending in / t/ and those with-
out can be seen nicely. But there are also irregularities, like the different
ways of forming the locative (which does not distinguish between plain and
modified forms for any of these nouns).","[158, 159]"

44
     I am deeply indebted to Gerrit Dimmendaal, who pointed me to this phenomenon usually
     found in some Bantu languages. He (Dimmendaal, to appear) reports a similar conjoint-dis-
     joint distinction for the Southwest-Surmic Baale language, and sees traces of it in South-
     east-Surmic Mursi.
134                                  Chapter III.3The terminology of conjoint and disjoint is taken from Bantu linguistics45,
where similar distinctions46 are found in a number of Eastern Bantu lan-
guages. Creissels (2012, p. 1) describes this distinction as follows:
       “[…] a conjoint verb form is a verb form that cannot be found
       in sentence final position, and cannot be separated from the fol-
       lowing phrase by a pause. A disjoint verb form is a form that
       does not have this limitation, but is not excluded from non-final
       contexts either, and a disjoint verb form in non-final position is
       not necessarily separated from the following word by a percep-
       tible pause.”
This description defines conjoint and disjoint in entirely structural terms,
and, as it stands, describes the behavior of the conjoint and disjoint forms in
Majang quite accurately, which is why this terminology is adopted here for a
Nilo-Saharan language. As far as I know, the terms conjoint and disjoint
were not applied previously for languages displaying ergative-absolutive
structures – this makes it necessary to use caution while applying the terms
in the Majang context with its very different syntactic and pragmatic en-
vironment compared to Bantu languages.
When it comes to the function of conjoint and disjoint forms, there are at
least some Bantu languages where the definition of conjoint and disjoint re-
mains on the structural level (Van der Wal, 2011, p. 1735). But even for
those, van der Wal asserts that “there are pragmatic effects attached to the
choice for the one or the other verb form, where the element following the
conjoint form is non-topical and may be focal [...]” (ibid.).
Van der Wal’s (2017, p. 15) most recent definition of the conjoint-disjoint
distinction is even more explicit in the inclusion of information structure as a
defining criterion:
       “The conjoint/disjoint alternation is an alternation between
       verb forms that are formally distinguishable, that are associ-45
   Besides the Surmic languages indicated by Dimmendaal, conjoint-disjoint distinctions out-
   side the Bantu family were also reported for Adamawan Doyayo (Elders, 2006) and the Gur
   language Yom (Fiedler, 2017).
46
   The situation in Majang does not fit the defining characteristics of metatony, as sum-
   marized by Hyman (2017, p. 108). Metatony in Bantu happens whenever the verb in ques-
   tion is followed by an object. But this is not the case in Majang, where the presence of an
   object in itself is not sufficient to trigger the tonal difference.
                             Conjoint-Disjoint Distinction                                 135       ated with an information-structural difference in the interpreta-
       tion of verb and/or following element and of which one form is
       not allowed in sentence-final position.”
Riedel (2009, p. 31) observes that in those languages which have this dis-
tinction, “a disjoint verb cannot precede certain focal items, such as wh-
words.” Even if this holds true for Bantu languages, such a claim cannot be
made for Majang. The conjoint form is not consistently observed in all
places where the verb is followed by a constituent in focus. The following
example shows the disjoint form preceding an interrogative pronoun:
Example III.29: disjoint forms preceding focussed NP
       ɟàrtí náːk, ɗàm kɔ̀ ɟìkónt?
       ɟàrtí          náːk         ɗàm       kɔ̀       ɟìkónt
       woman\SG.ABS POSS\1S.SG.ABS eat\3S.DJ RECPST.DJ what.ERG
       My woman, what ate her?
Furthermore, example V.93c) shows a disjoint form preceding a constituent
which apparently is in a new-information focus position, as the response to a
content question47. If the conjoint form cannot be reliably encountered in
front of constituents with new-information focus, then focus is apparently
not what the conjoint form signals.48
My previous publication on the conjoint-disjoint distinction (Joswig, 2015)
asserted that the distinction was based purely on syntactic parameters (p.
175). But this was written before I fully understood the importance of topi-
cality in Majang. Assuming topicality as the starting point of the conjoint-
disjoint distinction in Majang, as envisioned by Van der Wal (2011, p.
1735), would render the language much more similar to the state of affairs in
Tswana, as described by Creissels (2012, p. 18), which also has a super-47
   For a discussion of wh-questions as diagnostics for new-information focus, and some
   caveats, see Van der Wal (2016, p. 264ff).
48
   Van der Wal (p.c.) points toward a possibility how conjoint and focus may still be indirect -
   ly related in Majang; the assumption would be that verb phrases are marked as conjoint
   when the adjoining NP is counted as being inside the VP constituent – this would only ever
   happen to absolutive NPs, but only when they refer to unexpected or new, that is, focal en-
   tities. Question words in Majang are apparently outside their linear order in the clause (see
   section III.2.2.4), and therefore also outside the VP constituency, which would explain the
   disjoint marking preceding focal material. The same would have to be assumed for disjoint
   marking preceding NPs denoting responses to questions, such as in example V.93c).
136                              Chapter III.3ficially syntactic conjoint-disjoint distinction; it is diachronically traceable to
the presence or absence of a topical NP.
Topicality, as defined in section III.1, serves other purposes in Majang
beyond deciding the conjoint-disjoint marking, as it also is the basis of DEM
and differential-S marking. It turns out that disjoint marking before absolu-
tive P constituents always coincides with the placement of the SFT-clitic (see
section III.4), if all other structural conditions for its placement are met.
Therefore, the following is a summary of what the conjoint-disjoint distinc-
tion accomplishes in Majang:
      •   Only absolutive NPs can trigger conjoint marking on a preceding
          verb. Therefore, the conjoint-disjoint distinction is neutralized for all
          verbs not followed by an absolutive NP.
      •   The conjoint form on the verb shows that the following absolutive
          NP is not topical.
      •   If an absolutive NP follows a disjoint verb form, it implies that the
          NP refers to the P constituent of a transitive clause, and that this
          referent is topical.
      •   For S-constituents, the conjoint-disjoint distinction serves as a re-
          dundancy device indicating the topicality status alongside the dif-
          ferential-S marking described in section III.2.1.2. This is helpful in
          situations where the case forms are identical through syncretism (see
          example III.30).
Whether in a previous stage of the language the conjoint form was used pre-
ceding all non-topical constituents cannot be decided due to lack of pub-
lished data from any other related language. Currently one can only go by
today’s situation in Majang, which firmly places the conjoint form in front of
non-topical absolutive NPs, and the disjoint form in all other contexts.
So far the conjoint-disjoint distinction was only observed in languages which
do not make use of case marking. The syntactic status of an NP in Bantu lan-
guages can be captured by the more general terms subject, object, and ad-
junct, which are the terms used in the descriptions of Bantu conjoint-disjoint
distinctions (Creissels, 2012, p. 18 f; Van der Wal, 2011, p. 1738). In
Majang, instead, the syntactic properties of a noun phrase are closely related
to its case marking, and therefore the language must make reference to a
                         Conjoint-Disjoint Distinction                         137particular case (the absolutive) in order to assign the correct marking to each
verb.
It was stated above that conjoint status is a feature of the verb phrase, not
just of the verb. This is because in situations where the verb is followed by a
tense marker, such as kɔ̀, kɔ̀ː and ɓà, it is not the verb that is marked for con-
joint, but the tense marker. The verb appears therefore in the (apparently un-
marked) disjoint form, although the whole VP is conjoint (section IV.3.4.2).
The conjoint-disjoint distinction is quite useful for the syntactic interpreta-
tion of language data. The nature of the Majang case system does not allow
for an easy identification of case forms for each noun, as the differences be-
tween nominative, absolutive and ergative are usually expressed only tonally
or through idiosyncratic stem changes, if indeed they are expressed at all.
The conjoint-disjoint distinction therefore frequently allows a clear identifi-
cation between some homophonous case forms, as in the following
examples:
Example III.30: case disambiguation through conjoint and disjoint verb forms
   a) ɗeːgàr     wàrL        kɛkàr.
      sleep\3S.CJ dog\SG.ABS   again
      A dog sleeps again.
   b) ɗeːgàr     wàr         godej.
      sleep\3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM house\LOC
      The dog sleeps at the house.
Both examples have the same verb ‘he sleeps’ as the intransitive predicate.
Example a) has it immediately followed by the S in the absolutive case.
Example b) has the same S-NP following the same verb. Although on the
surface the two subject NPs in both clauses sound identical (the lack of
downstep on the nominative form cannot be heard in this context with a fol-
lowing low tone), the difference of the conjoint-disjoint marking on the verb
makes it clear that in example a) wàrL is in the absolutive case, whereas in
example b) wàr is not. It is therefore marked by the nominative case, which
becomes only clear through the redundancy effect of conjoint marking.
138                              Chapter III.4III.4 The Sentence-Final Topicality Marker (SFT)Another device of the Majang language related to topicality is the sentence-
final topicality marker (SFT).
This device consists of a velar nasal =ŋ, added as an enclitic to the last con-
stituent of a main clause, if this constituent is either a verb phrase or a topi-
cal NP. This main clause needs to be the last element of its sentence; a main
clause that is not the final clause of its complex sentence is not marked.
The following set of examples shows the use of the SFT-marker at the end of
the verb phrase:
Example III.31: SFT-marker following verb phrases
  a) kɛː ɓàrtɛŋ.
     kɛː         ɓàrt-ɛ=ŋ
     then        give.birth-3S.DJ=SFT

Part IV: MorphologyThis major part of the language description approaches the morphology from
a predominantly formal perspective, showing which forms are used in the
grammar, and what morphological processes account for derivational and
inflectional variation. To provide some much-needed background to the
reader, Part III: Basic Syntax gave an overview over the basic grammatical
distinctions that operate on the noun and the verb. The next few sections in-
troduce the morphology of the various parts of speech. The first of these is
the noun (section IV.1), followed by the verb (section IV.2, including stative
verbs). The other word classes, including pronouns, modifiers, adverbs, aux-
iliaries, prepositions and particles, are presented in section IV.3.","[149, 150, 151]"

IV.3.4 Adverbs
The Majang language uses two kinds of adverbs – the one being an open
class of regular adverbs which is used to provide any kind of adverbial infor-
mation on the clause-level, and the other a small closed class of particles
which provide information on tense.
                                Other Word Classes                                 305IV.3.4.1 Adverbs on the clause level
Clause level adverbs can be created in several different ways. First there are
a number of short adverbs providing information about the temporal or local
pragmatic setting. Many of them go back to some kind of demonstrative
form.
Temporal adverbs are: nɛːkɛ ‘now (POSS.3S.SG.LOC)’, cìcéL/cìcɛL/cìcɔ̀L ‘now’,
     L
càːdí ‘then’, kɛː ‘then’, kɛɓúː ‘sometimes’, òtóːp ‘often’, báꜜŋí ‘afterwards’,
   L                     L                                                      L
cáː ‘thereafter’, ɟéːmɛ ‘previously’, ɓéɲcè ‘today’ (from ɓɛːɲɔ̀ ‘day’ and ce
                                        L
‘DEM.SP.LOC’), kɔ̀ álɛ ‘yesterday’, kɔ̀ː álɛ ‘tomorrow’, kɔ̀ ájtínán ‘day before
yesterday’, kɔ̀ːL ájtínán ‘day after tomorrow’, rómíːɗ ‘in the morning’, írkíɗ
‘at dawn’, káːlt ‘at midnight’, tɛːn ‘in the beginning’.
Local adverbs are: cèːd/cèːdíL ‘here’, cɛːd/cɛːdíL ‘there (HR)’, còːd/còːdíL ‘there
(DIST)’, cáːL ‘there’, ìcíL ‘right here’, ɔ̀cɔ̀L ‘right there’, cǒːj ‘far away’, ɔ̀ːnkùŋ
‘near’, ɟók ‘nearby’, ɗíɗíká ‘right’, kántáL ‘left’ (dative of kántL ‘left hand’),
      L
ɗɛːgá ‘across, down’, ɛdɛn ‘up, east’, pàːnì ‘down, west’, ràŋànà ‘upwards’,
wàlàc ‘outwards’, wàlɛc ‘from outside’, cɛm ‘straight’.
Further short adverbs are used for providing modal information about the
action: ɟɛt ‘very’, cɔ̀kà, kàɗɛːŋ ‘perhaps’, dákɛːɗà ‘only’, dɔ̀ːc ‘well’, éːkéːrɛ
‘truly’ (locative of eːkeːr ‘truth’), kócɛk, kójùnk ‘like this’, kócùnk ‘like that’,
                                                 L
ìcígìcìgǐ ‘exactly like that’, kɛkàr ‘again’, ín ‘yet’, kɛlɔ̀t ‘carefully’, kɛɗɔ̀m
‘properly’, tɔ̀cɛ ‘correct’, líkì ‘correct’ (loanword from Amharic), mó
‘alone’.
Some adverbs are formed from two words, such as àgútL òmóŋL ‘together’ or
                                L
táːmɛtàkán ‘directly’ from táːmá ‘face’ and tàk ‘inside’.
At least one adverb needs to combine with another particle to form a com-
plete unit, the adverb ɓɔ̀ ‘also’. It needs to be followed by a pragmatic pro-
noun (see example IV.221). It comes in the following combinations:
Example IV.253: adverb ɓɔ̀ with pragmatic particles
   1S ɓɔ̀ rà      1P ɓɔ̀ re
   2S ɓɔ̀ re       2P ɓɔ̀ rɔ̀
   3S ɓɔ̀ rɛ       3P ɓɔ̀ rɛ
Other ways to form adverbs were presented elsewhere. Stative verbs can turn
to adverbs by use of their locative infinitive form, as seen in example
IV.202. Other stative verbs are adverbialized by using the clause-internal
306                             Chapter IV.3conjunction à (see example IV.201). But this device does not only work for
stative verbs, but for other verbs, too.

II.6.3 Toneless morphemes and polar tones
Not all morphemes of the Majang language have their own underlying tone.
Although all stem morphemes of Majang and all particles have their own in-
herent tone or tone melody, some suffixes are not specified for tone in the
lexicon.
Example II.32: toneless 3P.DJ morpheme
   a) íbáːlírL          b) làŋír
      {íbáːl-irL}           {làŋ-irL}
      play-3P.DJ             find-3P.DJ
      they play              they findThe 3P.DJ morpheme -irL for the i-class verbs always behaves like in these
examples, and in the same way the 3P.DJ morpheme -ɛrL for the ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs.
Following a stem ending in a high tone (example a), it carries a non-down-
stepped high tone. Following a stem ending in a low tone (example b), it car-
ries a low tone. This variation is best explained by a simple tone-spreading
rule which assumes that the suffix is inherently toneless. The morpheme-
downstep rule shown above does not allow the high suffix tone in example
94                                     Chapter II.6a) to be analyzed as an underlying tone, as it would then be downstepped. It
must be analyzed as the same tone as the high tone on the last stem syllable,
spreading over to the suffix.
Example II.33: tone spreading to toneless morphemes
      a) íbáːlírL        b) làŋír
         {íbáːl-irL}         {làŋ-irL}           LH      L            L     L
As can be seen in these examples, the situation is somewhat complicated by
the presence of a floating low tone on many of these toneless morphemes.
This means that when the 3P.DJ suffix -irL copies the preceding stem tone and
this results in a high tone on the suffix, the next word will then be down-
stepped, which implies a word-downstep situation and therefore the involve-
ment of a floating low tone. This is also the case in the following examples:
Example II.34: toneless PL-morpheme -ɛL with floating low tone
      a) kùꜜrojɛL     gàːnk         b) kùtùrɛ     gàːnk
         {kùꜜroj-ɛL}                    {kùtùr-ɛL}
         donkey-PL.ABS POSS\1S.PL.ABS    hog-PL.ABS POSS\1S.PL.ABS
         my donkeys                      my hogsThe plural suffix -ɛL copies the stem tone in both examples a) and b). But in
example a), the high tone on the following possessive pronoun is down-
stepped. Since the tone on the suffix in example b) is already low, no non-
automatic downstep is applied to the following possessive pronoun – the
high tone on gàːŋk is automatically downstepped compared to previous high
tones in the utterance.
This behavior is not what one would expect according to established phono-
logical universals. One of the constraints relating to tone according to Auto-
segmental Phonology is a strong dislike of languages for floating low tones
and for toneless syllables. Such constraints23 can of course be violated, as ap-
parently the Majang language does here, but it is striking to see that in this
situation, there should actually be no need for such a violation. The mor-
pheme -ɛL is a syllable and has an available low tone attached to it; one
23
     Cahill (2004, p. 13) translates Goldsmith’s (1976) Well-Formedness Conditions into Basic
     Tone Mapping (Well-Formedness) Constraints, of which the two constraints *TONELESS and
     *(L) are relevant in evaluating the behavior of Majang.
                                     Tone                                     95would therefore expect that this low tone just becomes associated with the
syllable, in this way eliminating the offending presence of both the toneless
syllable and the unassociated floating low tone. The Majang language
instead opts for leaving the floating low tone unassociated, while dealing
with the toneless syllable through tone copying from the stem. Other mor-
phemes, such as the 3P.CJ marker -ɛr on ɗɛjɛr ‘they want’, have a fixed low
tone, which is always realized on the syllable itself. There is no apparent
alternative to an analysis which assumes that there is an underlying differ-
ence between an associated low tone on some morphemes (such as on -ɛr
‘3P.CP’) and a non-associated, floating low tone on other morphemes, such as
the noun-plural marker -ɛL. The underlying representation of these two mor-
phemes must be different, as they behave differently in word formation.
At least some phonologists claim that each floating tone must connect to an
available toneless TBU. The Tone Mapping Rule in Halle and Vergnaud
(1982, p. 67), which they adopted from Williams (1976), would clearly rule
out Majang’s behavior. One way to uphold the Tone Mapping Rule is an as-
sumption that the floating L is created in the process of the tone-spreading.
Such a conclusion might be drawn as a result of the fact that almost all tone-
less morphemes behave like the 3P.DJ marker -irL or the plural marker -ɛL –
they have an inherent floating L. This could invite an analysis involving a
rule that somehow adds this floating low tone to a toneless morpheme when-
ever the resulting surface tone on the suffix is high. Unfortunately, this pro-
posed rule is rendered untenable by the presence of a few toneless mor-
phemes without a floating L when a H spreads on the toneless syllable. Some
non-modified plural nominative suffixes, for example, clearly copy the stem
tone without using a floating low tone, as in càkomà < càkom-à ‘friends
(NOM)’ or wàrtùn < wàr-tùn ‘dogs (NOM)’. There is therefore no rule in Majang
that places a floating L following high-tone copying. All other attempts to
maintain the constraint would require assumptions about tone replacement
on what is here called a toneless morpheme, and such an analysis would
make very complicated what can easily be described in terms of tone spread-
ing. Other languages display similar violations, such as the Bantu languages
Kikuria and Chiyao (Odden, 1995, p. 459), although the floating tone in-
volved in those languages is a high tone. In the following, all morphemes
with a similar behavior as the 3P.DJ markers -ɛrL and -irL, or the plural marker
  L
-ɛ , are represented in the examples as being toneless with an unassociated
floating low tone. Other analyses of their behavior may be possible, but I
leave these to be worked out by those who have a higher interest in main-
96                                    Chapter II.6taining the validity of the above universal that such morphemes should not
exist in any language.
One particular morpheme of the Majang language, the 1P.DJ suffix on the
verb, also shows variation, but in a different manner than toneless suffixes.
Example II.35: polar tone on the 1P.DJ suffix
     a) toníːL        b)   gùːgùɲíː
        {ton-í ,ːL}        {gùːgùɲ-í ,ːL}
        tell-1P.DJ          enter-1P.DJ
        we tell             we enterThe 1P.DJ suffix consistently has a high tone following a low-toned stem (ex-
ample a), and a low tone following a high-toned stem (example b). If it re-
ceives a high tone, it again causes downstep on a following high-toned word.
It is therefore assumed that the suffix in its underlying representation is
equipped with both a polar tone and a floating low tone, and is therefore re-
presented in the lexicon as -í ,ːL, where the superscript cross symbol represents
the polar tone.
For the two Gur languages Moore and Lama the authors Kenstowicz, Niki-
ema and Ourso (1988) demonstrated that polar tone goes back to an underly-
ing high tone that is dissimilated when following another high tone as an in-
stance of Meeussen’s Rule (HH → HL), which applies to avoid violations of
the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP). If this were the case in Majang,
then the underlying representation of the 1P.DJ suffix would be -íːL. It would
keep its shape when following a low-toned stem, and when following a high
tone, OCP would force it to be realized as -íː. Such an analysis would have
the advantage of providing the suffix with a more regular position in the pa-
radigm, where most other person markers also have a high tone, such as
1S.DJ -à or 2S.DJ -ín. The conjoint forms of these, including the 1st person
plural, have a fixed low tone: -à, -ín and -íː.
In spite of these benefits, such an analysis is not tenable for Majang. There
are countless morphemes in Majang with a lexical high tone that do not un-
dergo Meeussen’s Rule to avoid a violation of OCP. These include the other
members of the disjoint person paradigm listed above. When these follow a
high-toned stem, they are subject to morpheme downstep, which is the lan-
guage’s device of choice to deal with OCP violations. It could be argued that
the long vowel of the 1P suffix may trigger a different strategy, but there are
other long-voweled morphemes such as the disjoint impersonal marker -ɛːL
                                                     Tone                                                       97(as in ɓɔ̀lɔ̀ːꜜrɛːL ‘one grows’) that refute this idea. It undergoes morpheme
downstep like all other high-toned suffixes. Consequently, the only way to
describe the 1P.DJ morpheme is to assume an underlying representation that
includes its polar-tone behavior24. Majang can therefore be listed among the
languages that support Newman’s (1995, p. 775) and Cahill’s (2004) idea
that at least for some languages one can assume genuine tonal polarity.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"
"V.7.3 Questions and focus
This section presents a short overview of questions and focus phenomena, as
far as they have been studied so far.
Majang contrastive focus is accomplished by the use of the contrastive pro-
nouns (see section IV.3.1.1). Contrastive focus often entails a choice from
already known entities, which is why Dik (1989, p. 278) cautions against
equating focus with information new to the hearer. This is therefore a prag-
matically different situation from new-information focus, as defined by
Thwing and Watters (1987, p. 101): “Focus: that information in an utterance
which the speaker believes, assumes or knows that the hearer does not share”.
Information questions are a widely accepted and applied test for new-infor -
mation focus (Van der Wal, 2016, p. 264ff), as the component in question is
assumed to be in focus. The expected answer provides confirmation or infor-
mation, and as such is always new information (Dixon, 2012, p. 377). Study-
ing questions can therefore be revealing about focus structure, because, as
Dik (1989, p. 280) points out, “if a language has special strategies for the
expression of focus constituents, these strategies will typically be also used
for question words.”
The Majang language, in spite of its VAP syntax, places information with
new-information focus at the end of the clause, and does so also with interro-
gative pronouns, which fill the slot of new information. The responses to
questions fill exactly the same slot as the question words that solicited them:
Example V.91: information packaging in questions and their responses
      a) ɗàmíːL kɔ̀ tàːr woːɗ?
         ɗàm-íːL          kɔ̀   tàːr     woːɗ
         eat-AP.3S.DJ RECPST\CJ meat\SG.ABS who\SG.ERG
         Who ate meat?108108
  Here is an unexplained use of the detransitivized verb form in a question. This seems to be
  in free variation with the plain verb form in example V.92. Possibly the use of the detransi-
  tivized form has to do with the use of an unspecified and therefore non-individuated object ,
  which may then result in a less than fully transitive form of the verb.

"Example a) has a directionally unmarked verb, for ease of comparison with
b), which shows the same verb with the centrifugal marker. This centrifugal
component seems to imply that the subject looks away from its initial focus
and thereby notices something. Example c) has a centripetal verb, which
indicates a movement towards the deictic center. Example d) has the deictic-
transfer form, indicating a movement from one deictic center to another ac-
tivated participant.
                          Tense, Aspect and Mode                           373Directional marking systems are not unknown in the linguistic landscape of
Nilo-Saharan languages in East Africa, as similar systems were described for
Komo (Otero, 2017), Maasai (D. Payne & Otero, 2016) and various other
Nilotic languages (Mietzner, 2012). Regarding the Surmic relatives of
Majang, Bryant (1999, p. 88ff) described two sets of Motion Away and Mo-
tion Towards suffixes for Tirmaga, which don’t seem to have any phonologi-
cal similarity with the morphemes found in Majang. Mütze (2014, p. 91)
showed a ventive marker operating in Mursi. Dimmendaal (1998a, p. 49f)
reported further use of directional morphology in Tennet.
But the deictic-transfer form seen above is so far not attested in Surmic lan-
guages. Although the details are quite different, the Majang system seems to
be reminiscent of the intriguing situation described by Otero (2017), which
also features not just the two often-encountered distinctions between centri-
fugal and centripetal, but a third value; this again seems to be tied to a sec-
ond deictic reference point. On the other hand, the situation in Koman lan-
guages is much more complex than in Majang, as the deictic-directional
markers there make use of the concept of associated motion (see Belkadi
(2015, p. 50) for a recent discussion of this concept from a typological per-
spective). Majang directional morphology only appears to be used where the
basic verbal semantics allow for a directed interpretation. Associated motion,
instead, is expressed by serial-verb constructions (see section V.8.4 and ex-
ample V.80 for an illustration of this).
It was shown in section IV.2.3.3 that the deictic-transfer form exhibits mor-
phologically different behavior from the other two direction forms centri-
petal and centrifugal. Therefore it would not be surprising to find that other
Surmic languages make no use of deictic transfer. Everything points to the
assumption that the TF-form is a quite recent innovation of the Majang lan-
guage. But the source could hardly have been the similar systems found in
Koman languages (Otero, 2017; D. Payne & Otero, 2016), as the Majang
moved into the vicinity of the Komo settlements only a few generations ago
– probably not enough time to borrow and establish such an intricate system
all over the Majang habitat. Nilotic languages (D. Payne & Otero, 2016, p.
15f) from the neighborhood of the original Majang habitat near the Boma
plateau should rather be considered as sources of this innovation in Majang.
Other languages with more complex directional systems in East Africa are
Somali and Päri (Belkadi, 2015, p. 50). These do not advertise themselves as
possible sources of more involved directional systems in Majang, as they
have never been in contact with any Majang population.
374                                Chapter V.6It was shown in section V.5.4 that the deictic-transfer form is also used to
provide the material for the recipient-removal construction for the language.

to the no longer overtly expressed secondary deictic center of the construc-
tion. But there are other constructions involving the TF-form, where the
dative NP is not removed.

III.2.1.2 Differential ergative marking
Many languages with morphological ergative-absolutive case marking do
not have ergative-absolutive alignment in all possible contexts. If a language
displays an ergative-absolutive pattern in one context, and a nominative-
accusative pattern in another, the language is said to have split alignment
(Comrie, 1989, p. 110), for which Dixon (1994, Chapter 4) attempted to
31
     The example I had presented to this effect (Joswig, 2016, p. 473f) is troublesome in this and
     other ways, particularly because the A of the whole sentence was misanalysed as ergative,
     when it was, in fact, in the nominative case.
                     Case Marking on Central Constituents                  113establish universal criteria. These will need to be discussed for their applica-
bility in Majang, as in this language, too, split phenomena can be observed
beyond the already mentioned verb-indexation versus post-verbal case-mark-
ing split. But it will become clear that these split phenomena are quite differ-
ent from split phenomena in other ergative languages, and that it is better to
describe the data in terms of differential ergative marking (DEM), as pro-
posed by McGregor (2010, p. 1614f).
Practically all examples involving the ergative case are from elicited lan-
guage data. Looking at Majang narrative texts, it is very difficult to find
clear examples of the ergative case. The only two unambiguous examples
that I was able to find in my corpus of well-analyzed texts are the following:
Example III.9: ergative case found in narrative discourse
   a) nɛ càːdíL ɓéɲ òmáltè dɛnɛ wàːloːk gòpàn wɛjL lɛːrík.

      see-3S.DJ Waalook\ERG path\SG.ABS house\SG.ABS Leer-POSS
      Then, one day, Waalook saw the path to Leer’s house.
   b) ɟàrtí náːk, ɗàm kɔ̀ ɟìkónt?
      ɟàrtí          náːk         ɗàm       kɔ̀    ɟìkónt
      woman\SG.ABS POSS\1S.SG.ABS eat\3S.DJ RECPST what\ERG
      My woman, what ate her?
In these examples, the A of the transitive clause is marked by the ergative
case, as evidenced by the HL sequence on the last syllable of the proper
name in example a), and by the special ergative form of the interrogative
pronoun (see p. 387 for the other case forms of this pronoun) in example b).
In example a), the ergative is chosen for a main participant following a reset
of time and place, and with a different subject than in the previous clause. In
example b) the ergative is used for a question word asking for an unknown
subject; the object of this clause is left-dislocated (see section V.7.1.2) to a
position outside the clause. A less clear example shows an NP in the am-
biguous form that is identical for both the modified nominative and the
modified ergative:
114                                      Chapter III.2Example III.10: textual example with ergative case assumed by word order

   because that hyena had killed his friend,The NP ɗúŋéL cìnɛ can be either nominative or ergative according to its mor-
phological shape. The reason to assume that it is ergative in this clause is its
position following the verb, where in clear textual examples nominative A-
NPs were never encountered (see section III.2.2.1).
These rare examples taken from natural discourse are balanced by countless
examples from elicitation, using questionnaires with context-free example
sentences, where practically every transitive clause yields an ergative-abso-
lutive pattern, illustrated in the following clauses:
Example III.11: ergative case found in elicited sentences
   a) ɗɛnɛ wàr àdùreàk L.
      ɗɛn-ɛ     wàr                 àdùre-àkL

      kill-3P.DJ hog-PL.ERG            man\SG.ABS
      Hogs kill a man.
Undoubtedly these examples are unnatural in the sense that it is very dif-
ficult to find them in narrative discourse. The factor of preferred argument
structure, as proposed by Du Bois (1987, 2003), in combination with the ten-
dency of Majang to avoid free pronouns for subjects, explains the very low
frequency of ergative-marked noun phrases in natural texts. Preferred argu-
ment structure discourages the use of a full NP as an A argument. An NP that
                         Case Marking on Central Constituents                             115is not there cannot be marked for ergative, which renders the ergative case
invisible in a language that only ever marks it on an NP.
Still, it would be unwise to discount the information gleaned from such ex-
amples on the basis that they do not come from narrative texts. It remains a
fact that when a Majang speaker is asked to produce a transitive sentence,
without fail s/he first comes up with an ergative-absolutive case pattern in a
VAP clause. This alignment system therefore represents a deeply ingrained
grammatical structure that probably sees prominent use in everyday natural
discourse, but not in the kind of structured texts that linguists tend to analyze
for writing their grammars. The observer is faced with the notion that “when
a departure from Preferred Argument Structure does occur in natural dis-
course, the resulting utterance bears not a hint of ungrammaticality” (Du
Bois, 2003, p. 78). After all, “Preferred Argument Structure cannot be re-
duced to a grammatical rule. It must remain within the domain of discourse,
as a patterning of grammar with consequences for grammar” (ibid).
Now it still needs to be asked where exactly in natural discourse the erga-
tive-absolutive alignment system thrives to the point that it appears as the
grammatical system of choice in almost all elicited transitive clauses; if no
one ever uses it in any speech situation at all, this alignment system would
be quickly forgotten by the grammar. Looking outside the narrative genre, in
my case, did not provide the answer: one text of my corpus is a planning
conversation between three speakers with well over 150 clauses, and still the
ergative case does not feature in this at all. The same is true for a short horta-
tory text. It therefore remains a rewarding task for future research 32 to deter-
mine the segments or genres of Majang natural discourse that freely admit
the use of ergative-absolutive systems. My hypothesis is that they must exist,
and that I just have not found them.
As for the alternative to this ergative-absolutive alignment system: as stated
above, the main reason why it is almost impossible to see ergative-marked
NPs is preferred argument structure. But even an existing A-NP is usually32
     Watters (2018, p. 394ff) conducted such research for the Tibeto-Burman language Dzong-
     kha, comparing the impact of genre on competing case-marking patters. For that language,
     Watters concluded that “grammatical relations in Dzongkha is found to range from a split-
     ergative system to a pragmatic system, whereby the manifestation of one marking pattern
     over another is probabalistically dependent on and functionally motivated by genre.” The
     exact findings, however, are very different from the situation in Majang, showing a higher
     probability for ergative-marked As in monologic texts.
116                                     Chapter III.2not marked by the ergative case. Majang noun phrases can be marked ac-
cording to two competing case marking systems: one of them is the non-
topical ergative-absolutive case marking system, and the other the topical
nominative case marking for A or S. The choice between the two is of a
purely discourse-pragmatic nature, based on the topicality of the A or S in
the discourse (see section III.1 for how the concept of topicality is estab-
lished for Majang). The elicited examples seen above show non-topical in-
stances of A (elicited examples usually deal with non-topical participants, as
they leave the relevant context open to the interpretation of speaker and
hearer), and these are marked by the ergative case. In narrative discourse,
new participants are usually introduced in intransitive clauses, or as PS or ob-
liques, but practically never as an A (Du Bois, 1987, p. 828). From then on,
as long as they are activated participants, they are topical and therefore usu-
ally marked by the nominative case33:
Example III.12: nominative case marking on A

"This example also features another pragmatic particle, the question marker
kíː, which is not necessary to create a question (the interrogative ɛk would
accomplish this on its own), but it reinforces the question to the hearer.
Both particles í *ː and ànɛ could alternatively be classified as interjections (see
next section), as they can serve as non-elliptic utterances on their own
(Ameka, 2006, p. 1).
The particle àná is used instead of the imperative/jussive particle ìn in order
to downplay the magnitude of the imposed task:
Example IV.291: particle àná
   àná tùrgùmɛL!
   àná tùrgùm-ɛL

Majang people greet each other by use of the particle dìgój. This is very
similar to the greeting digé observed in the Omotic Benchnon language
neighboring the southern pockets of the Majang language area. The response
to this greeting is the verb bɔ̀dɛŋ ‘it is well’.
The particle tɔ̀L is used together with the conjunction nɛ and the 1S short pro-
noun tàL to exhort another speech-act participant to act on something.

A final pragmatic particle is ɔ̀rɛ, which serves as a thematic development
marker, which leads into a new thematic topic in a non-narrative discourse.

V.6.1.2 Tense inflection of subordinate verbs
Beyond the use of the tense markers, the Majang language provides another
tense system exclusively used on subordinate verbs providing a relative time
reference compared to the action of the main verb. Three different subordi-
nate verb forms were encountered: the relative-past subordinate verbs, the
simultaneous subordinate verbs, and the inchoative subordinate verbs. They
incorporate a good deal of aspectual or aktionsart information in their tempo-
ral structure. These forms and their uses are described in detail in section
IV.2.3.2. They were only encountered in their tense function in adverbial
subordinate clauses, so it is assumed that they are restricted from being used
in main clauses.
368                              Chapter V.6V.6.2 Aspect
Aspect in language refers to the “pattern of distribution of action through
time” (Talmy, 1985, p. 77), or, as Chung and Timberlake (1985, p. 213) put
it, “aspect characterizes the relationship of a predicate to the time interval
over which it occurs”. The Majang language is clearly sensitive to this rela-
tionship and uses grammatical means to indicate deviations from the norm;
this norm is defined by a perfective action. A perfective action is one that is
seen as completed within the event frame and therefore has closure (Chung
& Timberlake, 1985, p. 219). Perfective actions as the default are not in any
way marked by the Majang language:
Example V.72: perfective propositions
  a) nɛ ɓáL jàwɛ kúꜜrój cìnɛ ɓákìŋ.
     nɛ ɓáL       jàw-ɛ     kúꜜrój       cì-n-ɛ    ɓák=ŋ

  b) máL ɓòkòtú ɛmɛcL lɛːrǎːŋ.

     but kill-3S.DJ mother\3S.ABS Leer-DAT=SFT
     But he killed Leer’s mother.
  c) nɛ ɓɔ̀ rɛ kɛːɗí ɗɛːgá L cɔ̀L.
     nɛ      ɓɔ̀     rɛ          kɛːɗ-í   ɗɛːgáL   cɔ̀L
     CONJ    also 3S.PRAG go-3S.DJ        across   DEM\SG.DIST.DAT
     He also went across.
Each of these clauses has a verb that reaches closure – in a) and b) the
respective objects are dead as a result, and in c) the subject reached the other
side. The verbs are not particularly marked for this fact – therefore it appears
that the perfective aspect is the unmarked value of the aspect distinction in
Majang, except for stative verbs, which can only have an imperfective read-
ing in their base form. But even stative verbs reveal the perfective aspect to
be the unmarked state, as many stative verbs come with a reduplicated stem
without corresponding simple root (see section IV.2.4).
There is no reason to agree with Getachew (2014, p. 168) that the language
uses a perfective marker – he identified the sentence-final topicality (SFT)
marker =ŋ as such, but without presenting any convincing evidence to sup-
port this idea (see example III.35 in section III.4).
                                Tense, Aspect and Mode                           369Unlike Southwest-Surmic languages such as Suri-Tirmaga (Bryant, 1999, p.
103), Mursi (Mütze, 2014, p. 85f) and Me’en (Will, 1989, p. 141f), Majang
uses neither suffixes nor any suppletive verb forms to indicate imperfective
aspect; instead, it uses reduplicated stems (see section IV.2.2.7 for details on
their formation). These are mainly used to provide imperfective contrast to
verbs that are otherwise interpreted as inherently perfective:
Example V.73: reduplication to create imperfective verbs from perfective roots
   a) ɗɛnɛ wàr àdùreàk L.
      ɗɛn-ɛ     wàr             àdùre-àkL

Syntactic behavior
It is first necessary to explain why they are treated as free forms in this de -
scription of the language. Both Unseth and Bender were ambivalent in their
interpretation of these markers, sometimes (Bender, 1983, p. 134; Unseth,
1989b, p. 112) showing them as suffixes to the verb, sometimes (Bender,
1983, p. 135; Unseth, 1989b, p. 110) as separate words. From my interaction
with Majang writers it is apparent that the currently used orthography is in-
terpreting the markers consistently as suffixes (or at least enclitics, which
would make them part of the phonological word).
                                  Other Word Classes                                     307In spite of this, they are treated as separate words in the present description
because of their tonal behavior. Example II.30 on page 91 demonstrates that
the tense markers are not subjected to the word-internal downstep, which
provides hard and fast evidence of their status as free phonological word
forms. Tense markers like ɓàL ‘remote past’ or kɔ̀ ‘recent past’ have a con-
sistent high tone104, which is not downstepped even following a morpheme
carrying its own high tone. If the marker were a suffix or a clitic, one would
expect the H on the particle to be downstepped. Therefore one needs to as-
sume that these tense markers are used as free words.
Example IV.256: tense marker following a high-toned stative verb
      pàːkɛ kɔ̀ŋ.
      pàːk -ɛ     kɔ̀  =ŋ
      hot -3S.DJ RECPST =SFT
      He was hot.
On the other hand there is some good evidence that tense markers directly
following a verb are in terms of constituency a part of the verb phrase, as op-
posed to being outside of the verb phrase; this may cause their current ortho-
graphic treatment as suffixes or clitics. In a clause which satisfies the condi-
tion for flagging the SFT-marker =ŋ (section III.4) this marker is attached to
the verb only if it is not followed by a tense marker:
Example IV.257: tense marker with SFT-clitic
      pàːkkàL      kɔ̀ːŋ.
      pàːk-kàL     kɔ̀ːL=ŋ
      hot-CP.1S.DJ NFUT=SFT
      I will soon be hot.","[312, 313]"
"The recent-past particle usually does not trigger downstep on a following
high-toned word; the downstep observed here is therefore the morpheme
downstep happening only inside a phonological word. This is confirmed by
the rounding of the vowel of the short pronoun, which again can only happen
inside a phonological word. So in this example the short pronoun has turned
into a pronoun clitic. But I have found no other examples of a similar nature.
Apparently the short pronouns are currently in a transition from free words,
probably hailing from full pronouns, via verb-phrase particles, to pronominal
clitics. It may be predicted that they will develop into object markers on the
verb. Their behavior, in conjunction with the deictic-transfer form to fill the
3rd person gaps, already now creates paradigms that seem to fulfill this func-
tion (see example V.46).",[294]
"
III.2.2.4 Question particles and question words
Unseth (1986a, p. 97) pointed out that the Majang language violates Green-
berg’s (1966, p. 111) 12th universal, which states that “if a language has do-
minant word order VSO in declarative sentences, it always puts interroga-
tive words or phrases first in interrogative word questions […].”
This universal is indeed violated in Majang, as the interrogative pronouns
and question words are always found at the end. See section V.7.3.2 for the
use of these interrogative pronouns.
Example III.26: question words at the end of the clause
   àríːL kój cáːL òlà cìgì ɛk?
   àr-í ,ːL  kój cáːL         òlà         cì-g-ì    ɛk
   do-1P.DJ DFUT thereafter things\ABS.MOD DEM-PL-SP how?
   How will we then do these things?",[138]
"If the SFT-marker were to be used not only at the end of each sentence, but at
the end of each clause that complies with conditions 1 and 2, then one would
expect it in this sentence to show up following ŋàːrkí. But it is not used,
which establishes its role as a sentence-final topicality marker. This know-
ledge helps with parsing strings of main clauses, which in narratives are all
introduced by the ubiquitous conjunction nɛ. Speaker intuition quite often
lumped clauses together into one orthographic sentence which according to
the use of the SFT-marker apparently need to be broken up into two sentences:
Example III.38: the SFT-marker as a sentence recognition device
      máL cɛnkL wárL49 èːŋàɗàːŋ. nɛ èːŋáɗír ɗùŋéɗL à jòwɛːɗíːŋ.
      máL cɛnkL wárL            èːŋàɗáː=ŋ        nɛ èːŋáɗ-ír
      but 3S.CONTR dog\SG.ABS sniff\3S.DJ=SFT CONJ smell-CF.3S

      hyena\SG.ABS CONJ far\3S.DJ=SFT
      But dog sniffed. He smelled Hyena far away.
49
     This form could also be the nominative wàr, as the floating L cannot be phonetically estab-
     lished preceding a word beginning with a low tone. But in this syntactic context, accom-
     panying a co-referential contrastive pronoun, only absolutive nouns are encountered.
                    The Sentence-Final Topicality Marker (sft)                             143These two main clauses were originally seen by the informants as being
parts of the same sentence. The use of the SFT-marker following the first
verb, however, does not allow such an interpretation – that text segment
needs to be analyzed as containing two syntactically independent sentences.50
Two additional problems remain with the interpretation of =ŋ as a sentence-
final topicality marker. First, there are a few instances like the following
example where the SFT-marker is used and where absolutely no topical parti-
cipant appears to be involved in the clause. These examples contain imper-
sonal weather or environmental verbs.
Example III.39: further problems with the SFT-marker
     nɛ kɔ̀ɟúrúꜜrúŋ òkó cìnìk
     nɛ     kɔ̀ɟúrúr-í=ŋ            òkó        cì-n-ì-k.
     CONJ become.dark-3S.DJ=SFT like            DEM-SG-SP-POSS
     It became dark, just like this.
This sentence, at first glance, may fit better with the analysis of =ŋ as a
marker for argument indexation only, as proposed in Joswig (2015) – there I
assumed a completely syntactic rule governing its appearance on verb
phrases, whenever no other constituents were present in the sentence. This
analysis made no reference to pragmatic factors, but also had to wrongly
ignore all occurrences of =ŋ on noun phrases. An alternative interpretation,
in line with the idea of =ŋ as a topicality marker, is that weather and en-
vironmental verbs indeed refer to topical entities, that is the weather and the
general environment – the interaction of these with the narrative can be
taken for granted and is grounded in the world-view of the speech-act parti-
cipants.51
Second – and this can be illustrated with the same example III.39 – this
sentence has material following the verb marked by the SFT-marker. Majang
narratives frequently use such expressions which seem to express the attitude
of the narrator (see examples IV.267 and V.138b), and which are usually
translated as ‘just like this’. It might be possible to analyze them as extra-
clausal and even extra-sentence material which is thrown in by the narrator

IV.2.3.4 Imperative and jussive marking
Another verbal paradigm of the Majang language is provided by the impera-
tive/jussive forms, which are used for orders, hortative, obligation and
similar modal functions. Except for the imperative singular, which consists
of a simple verb form, they are formed by a preceding hortative particle plus
the verb form. For the 1st and 3rd person forms these are identical with the
respective simple main-clause verb forms. For the 2nd person, that is for the
imperative forms, different forms are provided by the language. For the 1S,
3S, 2P and 3P forms, the hortative particle is ín; for the 1P form it is koL.
Example IV.185: imperative/jussive paradigms
     àr (i)        do              ɓànkàːwr (a)       get strong
  1S ín àrà     let me do!      ín ɓànkàːwꜜrà    let me get strong!
  2S àrík        do!             ɓànkàːwrùk        get strong!
  3S ín à*r      he must do!     ìn ɓánkáːwúr         he must get strong!
  1P koL àríːL   let’s do!       kóL ɓánkáːwrìː       let’s get strong!
  2P ín àrɛL     do! (PL)        ín ɓànkàːwꜜrɛL    get strong! (PL)
  3P ín àrír    they must do!   ín ɓànkàːwꜜràr   they must get strong!
The imperative forms for the 2nd person are very regular for the plural, and
somewhat more varied for the singular. The plural form invariably adds the
suffix -ɛL with a fixed H and a following floating L to the stem. This stem is
usually identical with the simple main-clause verb stem, sometimes extended
by /k/ to separate the suffix from a stem-final vowel. Only three verbs pro-
vide an exception to this regularity. The three low-toned verb roots làːr (a-
270                                      Chapter IV.2class) ‘lose’, ɗɔ̀k (a-class) ‘bring’ and coːw (ɛ-class verb suffixes-class) ‘plant’ have a H-melody
for the whole imperative verb, as in ín làːrɛL, ín ɗɔ̀kɛL and ín coːwɛL.
The special morphology and the absence of a hortative particle for the 2S
form may suggest that it does not really belong with the other members of
the above paradigm. But its plural counterpart seems to bridge the gap to-
wards the other members, by using a special suffix and a hortative particle.
The 2nd person singular form is in most cases formed by the suffix -ík/-ùk.
This is the case for 107 out of 122 attested imperatives in the sample. The
stem tones, however, are less conservative than with the plural forms. About
half the low-toned roots change the tone to H for the imperative singular.
Only a few verbs choose different forms for their imperative singulars. The
suffix -àk is used for the four imperatives boŋàk ‘take out!’, díːlàk ‘bring!’95,
ɗíːgàràk ‘sprout!’ and ŋàːrák ‘go!’. Five more verbs use the suffix -à, which
copies the stem tone: dùgà ‘hide!’, ɓùrɓùɗà ‘descend’, dírkíà ‘straddle!’,
ɗànɗàmà ‘pray!’ and àːdà ‘wash!’. These five verbs are based on complex
verb stems ending in a long vowel. Suppletion forms exist for ɗɔ̀k,
imperative díːlàk ‘bring’ and for kùc, imperative wàɗík ‘come’.
All verbs also have the option to leave the imperative singular completely
unmarked. This happens regularly when the imperative verb does not end the
sentence, but some other material follows afterwards:

      Carry the fire of the pipe to the woman for me!","[275, 276]"
