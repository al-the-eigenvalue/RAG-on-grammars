expressed either by a different word or by the addition of kashel
(male), kar (female), e.g.            kwai,        man             ker,        woman

           For animals, etc., different words exist in a few cases
to express sex; in others kaus (male), kar (female) are a#ded, e.g.

                   guinea-fowl

the adjectives to indicate the male; when it is necessary to speak
of the female, kar is added.","[31, 32]"

particles used with each mood and tense. It is now proposed to
amplify'these and to consider each particle in detail. It should
be noted at the outset that their use does not alwa~rs correspond
vd th English tense usages.    One particle may be translated'by two
or more English tenses, accordi~€ to the context in which it-is
