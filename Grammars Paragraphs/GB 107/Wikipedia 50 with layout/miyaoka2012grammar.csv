3.1. Questions  content, polar, alternative, echo, indefinite, indirectThere are two major types of interrogative sentences: (a) content or informa-
tional questions (as with a wh- word) and (b) polar (yes-no) questions, each
with subtypes. Both typically have a sentence-final falling tone.    i) Content questions: A content question is a request for information that the
speaker expects can or will be supplied by the addressee. It requires an
ignorative word or phrase (nominal or verb; see § 15.2 for six ignorative prima-
ry stems  what, who, where, when, how, how many) and a predicate verb
occurs in the interrogative mood (§ 48.2), as opposed to a polar question in ii)
below.
    The ignorative word or phrase typically comes at the beginning of a sen-
tence, though it can occur later in the sentence as well.
    One question may contain two ignorative words conjoined by the enclitic
|=Ѥu| and as in (49) and (50).
    The verb used in a response (a, b) in the following question (32) is not nec-
essarily in the indicative mood as in (a) but is more frequently in the participial
as in (b), which is more reactive or responsive and is typically accompanied by
the reactive enclitic |=wa| (§ 54.1):(32)      Ki-naS                 tekit-a?
          who-ABS.sg.            arrive-INT.3sg.
          Who has arrived?
       a. NukaqS                tekit-uq.    ~      Tekit-uq              NukaqS.
          p.n.ABS.sg.            arrive-IND.3sg.

       b. NukaqS=wa             tekite-llria. ~     Tekite-llria=wa       NukaqS.
          p.n.ABS.sg.=REA        arrive-PTP.3sg.
          Nukaq arrived.The focus Nukaq for the question by ki-na may stand word-initially or not.
    Ignorative words in content questions may either be a particle (how), an in-
flected adverbial adjunct (why, when, where), or a core or demoted argu-
ment (what, who[m], which). Not only intransitive S and monotransitive P
and A, but any ditransitive T, R, or A can be questioned by an ignorative word
and the interrogative-mood verb (as illustrated in § 48.2)  cf. § 35.2.4 for ques-
168 Syntactical preliminariestions of ditransitive verbs. Content questions are more fully illustrated with
ignorative words (§ 15.2) and interrogative mood verbs (§ 48.2).
   Verbs of other moods than the interrogative, however, may also be used to
form content questions, see, e.g. § 47.2 for a participial-mood verb particularly
with the particle |ima| you know.
    ii) Polar questions: A polar question, in contrast with the content question
just above, does not occur with an interrogative-mood verb and is characterized
by the rhetorical question particle |qaa| (§ 53.2; instead of an ignorative word). 9
This |qaa| as a particle may occur independently as a free word meaning (is
that) right?  see (38b) for confirmation. But it is typically attached like an
enclitic to the sentence-initial word (except for vocative and interjective words),
nevertheless forming a non-HQFOLWLF ERXQG SKUDVH DV LQGLFDWHG E\  EHORZ
(which triggers a pre-boundary regressive accent, unlike an enclitic =).
    Depending upon which constituent is the focus of the polar question, (33)
has different constituent orders. Typically the particle is attached to the word
initial word, forming bound phrases /nùk|kàqqaa/ and /tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tùq|qaa/ with the
regressive accent on the final syllable of the first word:
(33) a. Nùkàq  qaa       tekit-uq?         Has Nukaq arrived?
        p.n.ABS.sg.QST arrive-IND.3sg.
     b. Tekít-ùq  qaa           Nukaq      Has Nukaq arrived?
        arrive-IND.3sg.QST      p.n.ABS.sg.
 thereby showing that the questioning qaa is not an enclitic. Compare with
enclitic bound phrases Nukaq=llu /nùk|kaq|ܾu/ Nukaq also and tekituq=llu
/tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tuq|ܾu/ and he arrived with no regressive accent (*/nùk|kàqܾu/,
*/tܺkí‫|ޞ‬tùq|ܾu/).
    A ditransitive verb in polar questions is shown by:
(34)         Arna-mA  TDD       cikir-aa         angunR
             woman.REL.sg.QST give-IND.3sg.3sg.man.ABS.sg.

             Did the woman give the man ice cream? Is it the woman who gave
             the man ice cream?9.     It is interesting to note that the distinction in verb mood that CAY makes between
       polar questions (marked by |qaa|) and content questions does not obtain in its clos-
       est neighbors Central Siberian Yupik (CSY; Western Eskimo) and Iñupiaq (East-
       ern), where the interrogative mood is employed for either type of question, but that,
       among the neighboring languages, Yukaghir, an isolated Paleosiberian language,
       follows exactly the same pattern as CAY, with an interrogative mood and the same
       contrast between the two types of questions  see Krejnovich (1982: 150151) and
       Endo (1993: 8385).

    A response to an polar question typically occurs with the affirmative particle
|ii=i| /ií=i/ ~ /ii=í/ yes (35) 10 or the negative |qaaƾ| /qaáƾ/ ~ |qaƾƾa| /qàƾƾa/
no (36) 11 in the sentence-initial position, and if a verb accompanies (though
not obligatory), it is done reactively in the participial mood and with the in-
teractive enclitic |wa| or declaratively in the indicative mood:(35)       Ii=i,    tekite-llria=wa      /            tekit-uq.

           (VVn |-ksait-| not yet; § 44) instead of -(l)lria.","[219, 220, 221]"
"    When replying to a negative question, Yupik speakers confirm or deny the
statement made in the question either with the particle ii=i yes or
qaang~qanga no (showing the same pattern as Japanese but not as English),
as in (37a) vs. (b):(37)      Tekite-ksait-tuq        TDD       Nukaq?

          No, he has arrived.   A polar question with _TDD_ is formally distinguishable from the confirma-
tion of a presumption by the questioner using the particle independently. Com-
pare (a) a polar question with (b) a confirmation:
10. It is very common, however, to raise the eyebrow slightly to express yes, often,
    though not necessarily, out of shyness. This is not only the case with children.
11. Pragmatically, however, the use of this negative particle may be more or less
    avoided, especially where definite negation could not be guaranteed (as in future
    events or happenings), in favor of some hedgings such as naamiki I dont know, I
    am not sure, aipaagni perhaps (fifty-fifty; aipa-agni partner-LOC.3du.sg.).

Negation (VVn)
1.      Double and partial negation.............................................................. 1285
NegationNegation in CAY is mostly clausal with a verb-elaborating VVn suffix in-
volved, except for a few privative verbalizing NV suffixes like NV |ƾLW-| to
lack, have no N, there be no N (§ 38.1) and apart from for one negative sen-
tence word (particle) |qa(a)ƾ| ~ |qàƾD| no (§ 53.2). There are no affixes for
word negation (like English un-, im-, -less). Ignorative stems (§ 15.3.2) may be
contextually negative as well as interrogative and indefinite. See also (§ 40.2.5)
for the ignorative complex transitive VVcm suffixes.
    A fair number of VVn suffixes are listed below, many of which have some
fusion with tense-aspect or modality. The most general and common negator is
VVn |-nћլit-| not and its variant |+1pѠkѠ-~+vѠkѠ-| (first in the list below), the
latter of which is selected by appositional-mood verbs characterized by the
mood marker |-na-| (instead of |-lu-|)  see § 51.1.3.
    Except for |-at-| (second in the list below) which is very much limited to a
small group of stems and suffixes, all VVn suffixes are composites, with two or
more morphemes fused together. Even the most general and neutral negator
VVn |-nћլit-| is a composition of the abstract nominalizer VNnm |-nћլ-|
(§ 18.3.1.1) followed by the privative NV |ƾLW-| (just above), while VVn
|-nћլiћլ-| no longer is of the same nominalizer followed by the privative NV
|+ƾLћլ-| to have N removed (§ 38.1). All the others also contain the negative
element |ƾLW-|, although the exact morphological and semantic relationships
with positive counterparts (if any) may hardly be obvious.
    There are a few valency-modifying suffixes, that is, two that add A IMP
(VVsm) and one with a complex transitive (VVcm) at the end.

tive suffixes (VVn; above) and privative (NV; § 38.1) as well as a number of
adjectival verb stems. A peculiarity of these /t/-final negative suffixes is that
they are adjectival and often followed by VV |- 1k*Ѡ-| to consider, which
fricativizes the negative-final consonant (§ 37.2.1).(1)       ca-u-nril-k-aanga               he thinks little/worthless of me

         optative future |-1ki-|; § 49.5, § 49.7).","[1323, 1324, 1325]"
"Some speakers differentiate by inserting (or retaining) the schwa in the second
(b). The negative (a) is ambiguous as it is homonymy with a separate verb stem
|Dƾћլ-| to say yes, i.e. ange-nrit-uq he did not say yes.
    The scope of negation (i.e., that portion of a sentence affected) by the suffix
in the two sentences below is different as indicated by the italics in translations:
The adverbial adjunct (with a connective-mood verb) is outside the scope of
negation in reading (a), but falls within the scope in reading (b).",[1326]
"
1.3. Negative appositionalsThe negative appositional mood marker |-1na-| occurs in place of |+lu-| after
(generally) negative suffixes and a few non-negative ones. The subscript 1 de-
letes a stem-final apical if (P5i) applies (with some caveats below):   i) Negative suffixes  include a) verbal elaborating suffixes of negation
(VVn; § 44) and b) a few verbalizing privative suffixes (NV; § 38.1). Except for
one VVn suffix |-at-|, all of them end in /it/, and the /i/ is replaced by /u/ in
many dialect areas.   i.a) VV negative suffixes  include |+1ƾ DLW_ will not, |-ksait-| not yet,
|+cuit-| never, |+1cuћnait-| definitely not, |+nait-| not to cause one to,
|+1cunait-| cannot, |+1cuumiit-| not to care to, etc. (VVn; § 44) as well as
extended stems with negative suffixes like |asiit-| to be bad (from |asiћլ-| to
be good), but excluding the general negator |-nћլit-| not (composite suffix
with VNnm |-nћլ-|) in (c) below:(17) a. |ayaћ-ksait[-1nani|                        he not leaving yet

negative appositional. The initial /p/ with the subscript 1 deletes a stem-final /c/

CAY comparison includes three types  comparative (e.g. to be bigger than;
§ 45.1), superlative (to be the biggest; § 45.2), as well as equalitive (to be as
big as; § 45.6)  each of which uses different morphological strategies with
different VVc suffixes as indices, although they are morphologically related
with each other. The general pattern they follow is summarized by:COMPAREE NP + STANDARD NP + PARAMETER-INDEX-VERB.INFLECTION
ABS                       LOC / REL / EQL            INTRANSITIVE / TRANSITIVE   It is remarkable that CAY comparative, superlative, and equalitive clauses
are not only an intransitive construction but can also be a transitive one
(Miyaoka 2004b, 2009), which is implied by the subscript REL for the standard
NP in the above pattern. The predicate has a verb stem as the parameter (to be
big), which may not only be stative but also be inchoative (to become/be
now bigger than, to become/be now as big as). This means a four-way contrast,
1288 Comparisonthat is, intransitive/transitive and the stative/inchoative distinguished by the
composite suffixes as indices which are all morphologically related with each
other.
    The comparative index is based upon the person-inflected abstract nominali-
zation by VNnm |-nћլ-| ~ |-Ѥћլ-| (§ 18.3.2), while the equalitive index is based on
the equalitive VVc |+ta-| (§ 45.6.1) and its deverbalized VN |+ta+(u)t-|. As
partly described in § 18.3.2, the indices are a kind of relational verb construc-
tion, either intransitive or transitive (§ 37), which reverbalizes comparative and
equalitive phrases. In addition, a few isolated lexical expressions of comparison
will be mentioned: |anaћc-| to surpass, |ayuqѠ-| to resemble, be similar to
(§ 45.9), e.g. (37).
    As the pattern above implies, CAY comparative constructions are not so-
called conjoined comparatives that consist of one clause containing the
comparee NP and the other containing the standard NP, cf. a very rare construc-
tion like (24), however. Furthermore, the transitive constructions are utterly
distinct from those types known in many languages that employ (free) transitive
verbs meaning to exceed or to surpass for their index, and from the type that
uses a valency-increasing affix such as from or in opposition to. Note, how-
ever, that the secundative ditransitive stem for to exceed, surpass (i.e. |cipѠc-|)
is the most productive device for non-round numerals in CAY (§ 14.3.1). See
Stassen (1985, 2008) and Dixon (2008) for cross-linguistic typology of compar-
ison constructions.","[1338, 1339, 1340]"

2. Third-person optativesA third-person subject optative verb is used to ask for permission or consent
from the addressee concerning a third person, with some reply expected, either
positive or negative, or to merely express the speakers wish concerning the
person.(19) a. Irnia-qaS         ciumek ner-li? May my child eat first?
        child-ABS.1sg.sg. first     eat-OPT.3sg.
     b. Irnia-maA            pai-lia?        May my child stay with me?
        child-REL.1sg.sg. stay-OPT.3sg.1sg.",[1419]
"   Interestingly, the suffix |+pakaћլ-| may occur without inflection, that is, like a
deverbal particlizer (VPc):(54)       ange-nru-vakar ~ ange-nru-vaa! i. oh my, how exciting!
                                          ii. how bigger (than)!

The optative mood chiefly expresses the speakers wish, request, or suggestion,
although it also has a non-optative use (§ 49.7) with a declarative force, like the
indicative (§ 46) and the participial (§ 47) moods.
    A third or a first person subject optative-mood verb is used to ask for per-
mission or consent from the addressee concerning the person, possibly with a
reply, either positive or negative, being expected.
    The second person optative can specifically be regarded as an imperative
verb for command or prohibition. The subject should be an A or Sa argument,
which typically has controllability.
    Negative optatives are prohibitional.
    An optative verb by itself generally sounds too direct, strong, or impolite to
be used except in limited situations. A number of devices can, however, soften
the effect:
    a) the third person is used instead of the first or the second person (disguised
person § 12.2.3.5, § 32.3.2)
    b) periphrastic constructions with |pi-| verb are used (§ 49.4.2, § 51.3)
    c) a number of non-inflecting words and suffixes tend to be selected by the
optative mood that give different connotations to the verb, like enclitic =tuq,
                                                                    Inflection 1363
=kin, =ggem, =gguq (§ 54), and particle qaa, ampi, atak(i), atek, ikik, kitak(i),
etc. (§ 53). See also |-1ki-| (§ 49.5, § 49.7).
    Inflectional morphology of the optative mood is more fluctuating and varied
than the other moods, and this is partly due to personal preferences, so the full
spectrum of nuances and details is beyond convering in this chapter.","[1413, 1414, 1415]"
"   Negative appositionals may occur in double negation (§ 44.1) together
with the general negative |-nћլit-| (§ 44). Compare with (17b):(27)       pi-nrite-vke-nani     (he) doing without fail

           do-NEG-NEG-APP.3Rsg.   iii) The negative mood marker |-1na-| is also found to occur in the future
and continuative prohibitional optatives (not to do, not to be ing) marked
respectively by |+1caqu(na)-| (§ 49.6.2) and |+1piiqѠ(na)-| (§ 49.6.3), thereby
showing some resemblance to negative appositionals. Comparison with Table
48 shows that 2sg. |-1naћ|, 1sg. |-1nii|, and OPT.2sg.3sg./APP.3sg. |-1naku| are
shared by both optative and appositional moods (see below).",[1479]

1278 Negation (VVn)   Although the suffix | ƾDLW-| will not is the most common negative future,
the general negator may follow VVt |+1ciqѠ-|, which is a stronger or more em-
phatic negation than |+1ƾ DLW-|:(26)       ayag-ciqe-nrit-ua   I will not go!, equivalent to the following:

tional variant |+1pѠkѠ-|, possibly with an added nuance of repeatedness.","[1329, 1330]"
"
6. Prohibitional optativesThe negative form of an optative verb expresses a ban or prohibition.",[1430]
"   A negative marker can follow the future. Although the negative future is typ-
ically indicated by VVn |+1ƾ DLW-| will not (§ 44), the future suffix may occur
immediately preceding the negative |-nћլit-| not to indicate stronger or more
emphatic negation:(20)      ayag-ciqe-nrit-ua              I will not go
          䍦ayag-ngait-qapigt-ua, with the typical negative future followed by
          the intensifier |-qapiћc-| (§ 41.3.1).",[1267]
"
3. First-person optativesThe first-person optative may merely express the speakers wishes regarding
himself or ask for permission or consent from the addressee, with an answer
(positive or negative) expected.(29) a. Ca-lii?                              What shall I do?
        do-OPT.1sg.

         see § 49.5 for the aspectual -qi-. Addition of the interrogative parti-
        cle qaa to pissu-qi-lii conveys stronger wish for confirmation.",[1421]
"
1. HedgingLinguistic hedging in GCAY, the avoidance of definite or too precise state-
ments, commitments, direct mentions, or personal opinions, is extensively fol-
lowed by deliberately selecting one of the devices available.
   The hedging practice is not merely concerned with a special set of words or
phrases in the language to be used in certain situations but is a matter of the
normal and common way of speaking in almost any situation in the daily life of
Yupik people irrespective of when, where, or to whom a person is speaking.
The use of direct or definitive phrasing, particularly with regard to personal
feelings or future events, would not be well received by conservative speakers
188 Sociolinguistic notes cf. Morrow (1990). Sensitivity to indirectness / politeness and reserve / re-
straint is an important feature of the language that permeates many aspects 
morphological, syntactic, and lexical  of its structure. There are a good number
of grammatical and lexical strategies that conspire to avoid directness, specifica-
tion, or assertion in speech. They also serve to show respect particularly to el-
ders.
    In constructing a word or a sentence, speakers will tactfully choose:   i) verb moods (§ 46 ~ § 51); see e.g. |-1cu(a)-| (§ 50.7)
   ii) subject persons  disguised person of the third for the first or second or
        of the plural for the singular (§ 32.3.2), possibly related to use of the lo-
        cative case to refer to a first or second person argument (§ 27.4) and to
        avoidance of vocatives by final vowel doubling to an elder or respected
        person (§ 31.1).
   iii) highly elaborate system of demonstrative such as |u-| this (§ 12.2.3.5-i)
   iv) particles (§ 53)
   v) enclitics  e.g. |=kin|, |=kiћլ|, |=ћuћլ| (§ 54)
   vi) various kinds of verb elaborating suffixes  e.g. VVa |-qaћլ-| just, mere-
        ly, politely, VVm |+1caaqѠ-| but actually, VVt |+niaћլ-| so that, soon,
        VVe |-Ѥini-| I see in addition to attitudinal or (dis)honorific suffixes
        (§ 20.3)
   vii) more or less set expressions of less assertive or possitive answers in
        combination with a verb or a nominal  e.g. aipaagni may or may not,
        fifty-fifty; lit. in one of the two (§ 5-fn. 11, § 11.4.3, § 40[179]),
        piyukuvet if you (sg.) like (§ 50.6), pillilria=wa it may/could be so,
        perhaps he did (§ 47(4)), or the like
   viii) frequent use of the semantically neutral or expletive pro/prop word |pi-|
        to do; one (§ 10.3.1-ii, § 34.7-ii,§ 51.3 etc.) instead of a concrete word
        (e.g. § 51.3.1)
   ix) avoidance or very infrequent use of the strong negative particle |qàƾa|
        no! which sounds too direct or blunt (as compared with English no,
        for instance) and may commonly be supplanted by such indirect or eva-
        sive or non-commital particles as naam(ell) or naamiki(ka) I dont
        know. The very common particle |ii=i| yes (§ 53.2) is most frequently
        replaced by non-verbal quick eylid movement upward, shyly among
        children in particular.
    x) use of informal nicknames (§ 11.6.1-i).","[239, 240]"
"
6.1. General prohibitionA second-person optative form with the general negative suffix VVn |-nћլit-|
expresses the prohibition of an action.",[1430]
"   The privative NV suffix has yielded a number of productive (more or less
fixed) composite suffixes of negations (VVn; § 44), including the most general
VVn |-nћլit-| not (composed with the abstract nominalizer NN |-nћլ-|).
   Examples of composite negative suffixes are given here, some of which are
not so clear in compositions or are almost beyond analysis, with full list of sev-
enteen being in § 44:(21) a. |-nћլit-|         not, with the most neutral nominalizing suffix VNnm
                          |-nћլ-|
          |-Ѥћլ(u)it-|    have never been; there was no such per-
                          son/time/place (§ 44), with the past NN/VV
          _ƾDLW-|        will not
       b. |-ksait-|       not yet
          |+(s)ciiћat-|   cannot.",[1063]
"The (a) and (b) group are described in separate chapters § 37 and § 38. The
former, i.e. relational verbs (a), are very productive in many ways, both syn-
chronically and diachronically, and will turn out to be the warp and weft of the
grammatical texture unique to CAY. Later chapters will clarify how important a
part relational verbs play in CAY grammar.    iv) Verb-elaborating suffixes (VV; § 39, § 40; § 41 through § 45)  modify a
preceding verb stem to form a verbally expanded stem, without converting the
word class. They are functionally most versatile and make up two groups in
terms of valency modification.
    One group is responsible for valency modification  increase, decrease, and
rearrangement of arguments  within simplex verbs (VVsm; § 39  e.g. causa-
tive, applicative, adversative, etc.) and for producing complex transitive
(VVcm; § 40  directive, speculative, causative, ignorative, etc.), which embeds
a simplex verb into a (possibly recursive) upper-layered clause with its own
agent argument (A') added.
    The other group involves no valency modification, but only concerns verbal
categories (VV; TAM, polarity, evidenciality, etc.), adverbial modifiers (of
manner, degree, location, time, etc.), and same-subject secondary verbs (e.g. to
wish to, pretend to, be tired of ing, etc.).
    Besides these major types, there are a few specific types of suffixes:   v) (Dis)honorific suffixes  include a fair number of NNh/VVh suffixes that
express an attitude/evaluation (e.g. affectionate, pejorative) of the speaker to-
122 Morphological preliminarieswards the person(s) or thing(s) concerned as the subject argument (S/A). One
and the same suffix works either NN or VV, but is conveniently illustrated in
§ 20.2 as NNh. Some suffixes of this type in particular have the peculiarity that
they are typically nomadic, floating among nominals or verbs, and others may
stand after particles or (inflected) personal pronouns and particles, reminding us
of postinflectional derivation (§ 4.1.3.2). 17   vi) Particle related suffixes  there are a small number of suffixes  cf.
§ 5.1.3.2  that may:(53) a. be added to particles  relational verb NVrv |+ƾu-| to be N, linker
        EX |+(V/VV)ћլ-| to utter/say, VVa |+1paћ-| to say loudly, possibly
        after particles as in § 41.3.2(111)
     b. be added to ignorative words and particles  intensifying VVa
        |-qapic-| ~ |-qapia(ћլa)ћլ-| (§ 41.3.1)
     c. particlize verb stems  exclamative VPc |+1paa| (§ 52.4.1)
2.5.2. Suffix orderThe considerable flexibility of word order within a sentence contrasts with the
relatively rigid suffix order within a word, which is, in general, determined se-
mantically, grammatically, and/or pragmatically. A suffix may have semantic
and/or syntactic scope over the immediately preceding suffix or an expanded
stem as a whole. Due to semantic or grammatical constraints, two suffixes may
occur in opposite positions, generally with some difference.
    Variously contrastive orders may be illustrated with two or three VV suffix-
es, each with different scopes, one of which is the reportative complex transitive
VVcm |+ni-| A' to say (§ 40.2.4):(54) a. pissur-ciq-ni-a                         she said he would go hunting
        hunt-FUT-A'.say-IND.3sg.3sg.
     b. pissur-ni-ciq-aa                        she will say he has gone hunting
        hunt-A'.say-FUT-IND.3sg.3sg.","[173, 174]"
"    Morphologically being NN or VV suffixes, they do not simply provide a
semantic elaboration on the preceding nominal or verb stem, but rather express
some attitude, feeling, evaluation, politeness, etc. of the speaker towards the
person(s) or thing(s) concerned, which can be either:
        (a) positive  expressing endearment or attachment, admiration, praise,
        and politeness, or
        (b) negative  expressing hatred and insults, criticism, and denial.
The attitude expressed by one and the same suffix, however, may be ambiva-
lent, either positive or negative.
    As an NN type, the attitude is expressed toward the referent of the noun
stem. As a VV stem, it is directed toward the argument, typically a person, but it
may be a thing connected with the verbal action. As a verb elaborating type,
they are taken as a kind of modality suffixes (cf. § 43.1).
    Characteristically, a (dis)honorific suffix occurs after nominal stems, includ-
ing common nouns, personal names, nominal demonstratives, and personal pro-
nouns. Though rarely, it also occurs after attributive nouns, numerals, non-
personal pronouns, and deverbalizations (relative and nominal clauses) 
akalla-cungaq, pingayu-cungaat, uquri-lria-cungaq from akallar- old one,
pingayut- three, qaku when (FUT), uquri-lria- one who is fat.
    Frequent co-occurrence of a (dis)honorific suffix with a nominal demonstra-
tive is the most remarkable feature of (dis)honorific suffixes. As described in
§ 12.2.1, nominal demonstratives (and the only nominal interrogative |ki(t)-|
who; § 15.2.2) have three different kinds of stems characterized by three ex-
panders added to the demonstrative roots as: a.) |+u-| selected by singular
nominals (except for ones in the absolutive case; cf. c.)); and singular-subject
verbs, b.) |+ku-| selected by non-singulars; and c.) |+na-| selected by the
absolutive singular case.
    In view of their morphology, (dis)honorific suffixes behave somewhat dif-
ferently than productive suffixes do in general in that, despite being suffixes,
they are characteristically nomadic, that is, they float among words of differ-
ent classes (somewhat like clitics), though in a far from uniform way. This im-
                                                     (Dis)honorifics (HNR) (NNh/VVh) 681
plies that they may occur interchangeably after nominal (incl. vocative) and
verb stems, but also very often after particles, although there can be a slight
difference in emphasis or implication depending upon which word it occurs in
or which morpheme it is attached to. They may also be repeated, occurring both
in a noun and a verb, or in two or more words of a sentence. At least one suffix
(|-ћլuћլluћլ-|) floats even within words, relative to other suffixes.

in the North Pacific Rim are reported to have a similar kind of attitudinal or
evaluative morphemes that float, and are usually diminutive or augmentative. 77.   In reference to Atkan Aleut, Bergsland (1989: 9) writes that certain derivative
     suffixes move from the noun to the verb, citing the following pair:
           Hla-kucha-X          hila-ku-X.    The little boy is reading.
           Hila-kuch-ku-X.                    He is reading, the little one.
     Again, with reference to Koryak (and Chukchi) of the language family adjacent to
     the Eskimo-Aleut group, M. Kurebito (2000) provides detailed information and a
     discussion of generally the same kind of phenomena found in a number of diminu-
     tive and augmentative suffixes by distinguishing stem-modifying and argument-
     modifying suffixes. It is interesting to note, however, that in this language the ar-
     gument-modifying suffix, which floats like in CAY, refers to the O or S argument
     in the ergative pattern, unlike the unanimous subject in CAY.
         Finally, in his celebrated classification of grammatical concepts in Language
     (1921), Sapir discusses a Nootka diminutive affix in detail (100111). It is more
     of a feeling-element, an element of nuance, than our -ling (111, fn. 17) that floats.
     Although the term affix is used, it may actually be an enclitic, given his remark
682 Nominal elaborations    NN/VV |-cuƾaћլ*-| cute, nice little, dear. Generally used teasingly or mis-
chievously towards one to whom the speaker feels dear or close, particularly
between cross cousins (cf. § 11.4), but also from an older to a younger person,
expressing an attitude of affection or carrying a flavor of endearment. The suf-
fix may sound like something uttered by the older speakers. It is more promi-
nent outside of Kuskokwim where the diminutive |-cua(ћլa)ћլ*-| ~ |-1ksua(ћլa)ћլ*-|
(§ 20.1.1) is instead more common, although the diminutive floats to a much
more limited extent.(175) a. arna-cungaq      / arna-cuar                (dear) woman

cation from the particle |ataam| again (§ 53.4-ii), but should be distinguished
from the ditropic |am=| ~ |=am|, which is a truncation of the particle |ampi|
hurry up (§ 54.1-i).",[1605]

may be followed by the privative suffix NV |ƾLW-| to lack as VV |-nћլit-| ~

3. FunctionsThe nuclei of a clause are formed of a verb and nominal(s), i.e. inflecting words,
and even though non-inflecting words are restricted or almost devoid in deriva-
tion and inflection, they are highly important in the actual functioning of the
language and carry multifarious and subtle and obscure nuances that are often
hard to define. The semantic interactions of a non-inflecting word with another
lexical item or a grammatical form result in a wide variety, so elusive as to defy
exact definition.
    CAY has a fair number of non-inflecting words that are interjective/excla-
mative or of adverbial nature, but they are not the kind of words that constitute
such phrasal verbs as abound in English (e.g., to put off, turn down).
    The language has no prepositional or postpositional particles either, the
functions of which are well handled by an abundance of location nouns and
demonstratives in an oblique case (§ 11.2 and § 12). It has hardly any subordi-
nate conjunctions (conjunctional non-inflecting words) either, although there
are a few coordinating-conjunctional particles or enclitics whose occurrence is
highly frequent. Its near lack of subordinate conjunctions (e.g. because, when,
if, etc.) is partly related to its highly developed system of connective-mood and
appositional-mood verbs (§ 50 and § 51).
    Though with the strong reservation that the distinctions are, by necessity,
more or less elusive and obscure in many instances, CAY particles may be clas-
sified for the sake of convenience as follows:       1.   interjective/exclamative                    § 53.1, § 54.1
       2.   sentence word                               § 53.2,
       3.   sentence-adverbial (modal, expressive)      § 53.3, § 54.2, § 54.3
       4.   adverbial                                   § 53.4, § 54.3
       5.   conjunctional                               § 53.5, § 54.5
       6.   discoursive                                 § 53, § 54.1, § 54.4
       7.   sentence fillers                            § 53.6, § 54   One and the same particle may naturally have different functions that belong
to two or more groups. Some interjective/exclamative and adverbial particles
are more or less conjunctional. The particle |tawaam| (§ 53.5), for instance, can
1508 Non-inflecting words in generalbe conjunctional (but), adverbial (delimiting only), discoursive, or implica-
tive of indirectness, as below.
    The use of some non-inflecting words (sentence-adverbial and inter-
jective/exclamative ones in particular) makes into narratives sentences that oth-
erwise would be mere statements. This implies that those words are almost ob-
ligatory in connection with participial-mood verbs (§ 47) and are very often
required by optative-mood constructions (§ 49).","[1559, 1560]"

Enclitics

4.        Reportative/quotative ....................................................................... 1555
5.        Coordinating ..................................................................................... 1559
The CAY enclitics, generally monosyllabic, form a closed class of a little more
than a dozen, of which a few seem to be originally composite.
    Two of them |=wa| (§ 54.1) and |=kin(a)| (§ 54.2) may behave as non-
enclitic particles also, that is, | wa| and | kin(a)| (for some speakers/dialects).
    Clearly distinct from derivational or inflectional suffixes, they may attach to
words of any category (following the word, that is, to its right), whether inflect-
ing (nouns or verbs) or non-inflecting.
    While one enclitic |=Ѥu| and (§ 54.5) is syntactic, i.e. coordinating-
conjunctional, all the others are taken basically as interactive adverbs and play a
greater role especially in conversations and narratives, containing some element
of modality. There are no pronominal enclitics in CAY (although all the person-
al pronouns may occur in bound phrases).
    Except for the coordinating conjunctional |=Ѥu|, they are second-position en-
clitics, being attached to the first word of a sentence.
    Enclitics may occur in succession, but three in succession (58)
=llu=ggur=am is rather rare and four in § 52(4) =kiq=ggur=am=llu may per-
haps be the maximum.
    The classification of enclitics below is again a tentative one. The first three
groups are very common in (particularly interactive) discourses and narratives,
but not so much in descriptive or explanatory speech and writings.","[1595, 1596]"

2. (Dis)honorific (or attitudinal) expressionsCertain NNh/VVh suffixes (§ 20.3) are selected to express the speakers attitude
toward or evaluation of the topic  person(s) or being(s) especially from within
the natural world  to be uttered. Distinctions are basically made among positi-
ve or honorific (elevating, respectful, desirable, or endearing), negative or dis-
honorific (depreciating, derogatory, or condescending).
   (Dis)honorific or attitudinal expressions by means of the suffixes are very
common in daily utterances and in narratives, but less in formal speech such as
ceremonial or public speaking. Usually these suffixes (except NNh |-ћլuћլluћլ-|
poor, sorry) may not be used to refer to elderly persons, however.
   In addition, Yupik speakers love to use cooing words  called |inqut-| ~
|inqutaћլ-| (from |inѠqѠ-| to coo (to child)) and VNrl/nm |+1ut-| or its derivative
|+1utaћլ-| means)  in addressing to a baby or a young child, whether a relative
or not. As a child grows up, their use may fall off (at least at the presence of
other people, when it is possibly embarrassing).",[241]

1. Functions and morphologyIgnoratives are a class of morphologically diverse words, functionally common,
however, in that they are required in content questions (§ 5.3.1) in which the
head verb selects the interrogative mood (§ 48), and they may subsume not only
ignorative uses (e.g. where, § 15.2) but also non-interrogative uses, i.e. indefi-
nite (somewhere, § 15.3.1) and negative (nowher, § 15.3.2).
    There are six ignorative stems, two nominals, two ambivalent, and two parti-
cles:

444 Ignoratives    The three of them |na-| where, |ca-| (to do) what, and |ki(t)-| who have a
limited extent of denominal derivation.
    Either nominally or verbally, they inflect only to a limited extent and not all
in the same way. While |ca-| what and |ki(t)-| who inflect for number and
case, |qavciћլ-| how many and |na-| where inflect only for case (but the latter
like adverbial demonstratives). The expanded (nominal) ignorative stems
|na(t)-|, etc. that are derived from |na-| where inflect for person (possessor) 
see § 12.3.3 for |+t-| selected by adverbial demonstrative stems to derive loca-
tion nouns.
    A verbally inflected ignorative word in the interrogative mood functions by
itself as a content (or wh-) question. This is also the case for interrogative claus-
es that consist of the ignorative |qaillun| how or |ca-| (to do) what and the
generic bivalent stem |pi-| to do; thing (§ 10.3.1) in the causal-connective,
appositional, or participial mood.
    Ignorative words used in conjunction with an interrogative-mood verb |pi-| 
e.g. pi-a (INT.3sg.) just below  are frequently used as a kind of set phrase for
expressing uncertainty (e.g. I am not sure how, I cant really say how [but...])
besides their use in asking questions (e.g. how does he, whats wrong with
him?):(1)       qaill (qangvaq, qavci-nek,        ki-na,          na-ni,..)

"    As a matter of fact, a CAY appositional verb does not remain solely as a
cosubordinate clause. On one hand, it may function more like an adnominal
clause (§ 16.6-i, § 51.5), as just above and, though less frequently, like a quasi-
nominal clause (§ 51.6); on the other hand (as mentioned), it may be used inde-
pendently like a coordinate clause or a main clause by itself (§ 51.4), supplying
a connected new piece of information (like an afterthought, emphasis, affirma-
tion, or statement of something contrary to what is supposed by another speak-
er). Particularly in narratives, a more or less connected sequence of events is
frequently expressed through a series of verbs in the appositional rather than the
independent mood, sometimes even with changes of the subject, to such an ex-
tent that appositional verbs function as main clauses.
    In the following sections, the basic morpho-syntactic characters of the appo-
sitional mood are outlined in § 51.1, and an attempt is made to classify the func-
tional and semantic diversity of the mood in the rest (§ 51.2 through § 51.7).

1.1. Mood markerThe most important morphological characteristic of CAY appositional verbs is
that their inflection has the suppletive mood marker |+lu-| 2 ~ |-1na-| (called
negative appositional, § 51.1.3) followed by a single person, i.e. mono-
personal, marker (just below).
    The monopersonality here means that, even when it is semantico-
syntactically transitive, an appositional verb marks only one person, as opposed
to a transitive verb in any other mood, which marks a bipersonal relationship
(such as IND.3pl.1sg. |(+ћaћլ)ƾDWƾD| they  me). More details in § 51.1.4.
    Verbal person markers (Table 30; § 32.2.1) are employed to mark the single
person for appositional verbs. Table 50, above, gives the complete paradigm of
appositional inflections. This can be compared with the inflectional paradigms
for the other five moods (Tables 46 through 49), which are bipersonal for transi-
tives.
    While the two 1sg. appositional markers (|+lua| and |-1nii|) are formed by
regular phonological adjustments, the only morphological idiosyncracy is the
negative 2sg. |-1naћ| instead of *|-1natѠn|.","[1472, 1473]"

1.     The suffix may perhaps be a reflection of a very deep-rooted perception in CAY
       culture. The English gloss (imitation, copy, fake, pretention) might sound like a
       negative or (even) derogatory concept; but the suffix may be better understood as
       reflecting a positive significance of identification with when man and nature (non-
       human world) are merged in harmony, given, for instance, the ways in which
       a -nguaq or -nguar-ing (imitation) is used and done in various aspects of traditional
       life (particularly in ceremonies like the elriq or memorial feast). The word (69) ca-
       nguaq mask is also used as a very important item connecting man with nature.

limited. Apart from the future |+kaћլ-| which is responsible for the two compo-
site nominalizers |-ѤѠћլkaћլ-| and |+(u)ciћլkaћլ-| (as given in Table 13), hardly any
nominal elaborating suffixes stand after a nominalization VNnm.
    There are a small number of NV which stand after a nominalization, yielding
composite suffixes (VV < VNnm-NV), most of which are largely gramma-
ticalized or fixed grammatical markers.
    The nominalization suffixes |-Ѥћլ-|, |-nћլ-|, |+(u)ciћլ-|, |+1caћլait-| are followed
by two kinds of NV suffixes:(81) a. relational verbs (intransitive) NVrv |+ƾu-| and (transitive) |-kѠ-| and
        their corresponding inchoative versions |+ƾu-ћլc-| and |-k-saћuc-| 
        § 37
     b. privative NV |-ƾit-|  § 11.2.3.2, § 38.1. which have yielded the following two groups of composite suffixes, all of
which are very common and basic grammatical markers in CAY:           intransitive / transitive
(82)       |-Ѥћլu-|     / |-ѤqѠ-|*           past tense marker ed (§ 42.1)
           |-nћլu-|     / |-nqѠ-|            comparative index to be more (§ 45.1)
           ( |+1ta-| ) / |+1tat(Ѡ)kѠ-|**     equalitive to be as  as (§ 45.6)
           |+(u)ciu-| / |+(u)ciqѠ-|          similative to be like (§ 18.2.1.3)

586 Nominal clauses (b) is a rather rare composition where a verbalizing suffix (|-li-| to make)
other than a relational or a privative one is involved, as illustrated in (111).
    While some are not necessarily fixed, many of these composite suffixes be-
have like single grammatical markers (VVt, VVn, VVc, VVcm in particular).
The nominalizers |-Ѥћլ-|, |-nћլ-|, and |+(u)ciћլ-|, with person and case (oblique)
inflection, have diachronically contributed to the contemporative-connective
mood marker (when; § 50.8) and some of the quasi-connective mood markers
(until, after, since, as soon as, whether; § 50.11).
    In addition, the nominalizers also occur in much less fixed composition,
more along the lines of incidental suffix sequences with one of the two kinds of
suffixes (relational and negative), and they are responsible, together with
relativizers, for morphological reverbalizations or transcategorical changes
characteristic of the language (§ 17.8.1). As such, these are more of syn-
chronical derivation than diachronical (above).","[636, 637, 638]"

words are non-interrogative, i.e. indefinite or negative (some or no).
    While the ignorative pronoun ki-na (ABS.sg.) in (a) and (b) below is inter-
rogative (who) with interrogative-mood inflection (-a INT.3sg.), it is indefi-
nite (someone) in (c) with an indicative verb (-uq IND.3sg.), and negative (no
one) in (d) with the negative VVn -nrit-:(68) a.   Ki-naS    aya-llru-a?        Who went/left?
     b.   Ki-naS    aya-nrit-a?        Who didnt go?
     c.   Ki-naS    aya-llru-uq.       Someone went.
     d.   Ki-naS    aya-nrit-uq.       No one went.    Interrogative use as contrasted with indefinite use is illustrated with the rela-
tive ki-a (REL.sg.) in the A function. Note the difference between (a) vs. (b) in
verbal inflection, i.e. interrogative vs. indicative, both with future specification

rare case in which a nominalization is reverbalized by other suffixes than the
negative and the relational verbs, as stated in § 18.1:(111)       kuingir-ngail-ucirk-i-llru-anga

Non-inflecting words
Words other than nominals and verbs do not inflect (§ 52). Non-inflecting
words consist of particles (§ 53) and enclitics (§ 54). While particles are a
semi-closed class, enclitics are a closed one. The latter contains a limited mem-
bership of around a dozen.

1. Particles and encliticsCAY non-inflecting words  which, unlike nominals and verbs, do not inflect 
are either particles or enclitics. Many of them generally are expressive or intro-
duce the modification of a discourse function, with the exception of conjunc-
tives. Some are illocutionary and others may be more or less expletive, serving
as lubricants in utterances. However, many non-inflecting words are so subtle
and elusive as to defy clear-cut definition. Their functional classification cannot
be a neat one, and the one made below (§ 52.3) is nothing but tentative.
    Particles are polysyllabic, while enclitics are monosyllabic like |=lu|, |=kiћլ|,
|=ћuћլ|, and |=wa|. An enclitic is dependently attached to a preceding word,
forming an enclitic bound phrase, while a particle occurs independently, i.e.
with potential pause, or dependently, i.e. forming a non-enclitic bound phrase
characterized by a pre-boundary regressive accent  see i) below.
    There are a few monosyllabic words that some speakers (or speakers in some
areas) may use as non-enclitics, that is, with a pre-boundary regression: |=wa| ~
_  wa| and |=kin| ~ _  kin(a)| (§ 54.1-i, § 54.2-ii).
    The bisyllabic particle |qaa| may stand independely by itself meaning is that
right?, but is used typically as the marker for polar questions when it is at-
tached to the sentence-initial word like _ qaa| (§ 53.2). It seems like a second-
word enclitic, but forms a non-enclitic bound word and triggers a pre-boundary
regressive accent, unlike an enclitic (§ 8.4.1). Distinct from |qaa|, there are two
interjective particlizing suffixes VPc |+1paa| and |+naa| (§ 52.4).
    The language has no proclitic per se: The proclitic-like |am=| (urging) as in
DP¶  QHUL hurry up, and eat! is a truncation and can also be enclitic-like
|=am| (§ 54.1-iii).
1502 Non-inflecting words in general    i) An enclitic is always a bound word that leans phonologically upon its
immediately preceding host word, forming a single articulus, i.e. an enclitic
bound phrase marked here with an internal = (though with a hyphen in practical
orthography  § 3.6.3.1). The host, which may be any word, either inflecting or
non-inflecting, is generally at the initial position of a clause  i.e. a so-called
second-position clitic (referred to as Wackernagels Law), except for the con-
junctive |=lu| and, also, as well (§ 54.5), which occurs after the last of two or
more conjoined words, if any, in a sentence, as well as the reportative |=ћuћլ| it
is said; tell (s.o.) (§ 54.4), whose position in a sentence is determined by its
syntactic function.
    On the other hand, a particle may either be free or bound, i.e. may occur in-
dependently as a single articulus or may combine with another preceding or
following word, forming a non-enclitic bound phrase (§ 2.3.1; marked with an
LQWHUQDO  RQO\ LI WKH LQIRUPDWLRQ LV UHOHYDQW  but with only a space and no
mark in practical orthography). A non-enclitic bound phrase triggers a pre-
boundary accent regression, as contrasted with an enclitic bound phrase.    ii) Cliticization from formerly free words is not attested in CAY. Nor, for
that matter, is there any evidence at all of sufficalization from enclitics. And
clitic use of free words is not found either (unlike, e.g. English ve and ll from
have and will). CAY enclitics are not reduced forms of words with an inde-
pendent existence. Unlike clitics in many other languages, 1 CAY enclitics do
not include such items as pronouns, determiners, tense markers, case markers,
etc. In this language, personal pronouns or determiners (demonstratives) in
CAY, for instance, are free words, though they very often occur in (non-
enclitic) bound phrases (§ 2.3.1), while tense and case markers are pure and
simple suffixes.
    CAY enclitics are clearly distinct from suffixes (either derivational or in-
flectional) and they can never be interchangeable. The language does not fea-
ture the phenomenon of gradation in this regard between the two kinds of mor-
phemes. Enclitics are words and always stand after a full-fledged (morpho-
logically complete) word, forming postinflectional articulations (phonologically
bound), while suffixes cannot stand on their own but only exist as a part of a
word. Cf. a few caveats, e.g., in § 41.3.1-iii.","[1548, 1549, 1550, 1551, 1552, 1553, 1554]"
"    The most common particle of this group is the particle |qaa| is it so? is that
right? as used independently. But it is much more commonly used for a polar
question marker (yes-or-no type; § 5.3.1-ii, etc.), appended like an enclitic to
the first word of a clause involved, forming a bound phrase (like a second-
position enclitic, though it is not an enclitic and hence marked by non-HQFOLWLF 
like angyar-cì  qaa your boat? A typical reply is made by (a) |ii=i| yes or
(b) |qa(a)ƾ| ~ |TjƾD| no. See 6.1-ix for non-verbal yes.",[1574]
"
2.2. Constituents of inflecting words  stem, derivation, and inflectionAs stated, inflecting words, either verbs or nominals, morphologically consist of
two obligatory constituents, a stem (called a base by some Eskimologists),
which always comes word-initially, and an inflection, which stands finally to
morphologically complete an inflecting word as a form, signaling its end.
   It is the inflection that determines the word class, but not a word-initial stem
(or root). A stem can be indefinite or ambivalent (nominal and verbal) and can
change the class repeatedly by transcategorial suffixes within a word (§ 4.2.5.1).
A stem may have a sequence of recursive transcategorial suffixes, finally be-
coming either a noun or a verb depending upon the functional kinds of the suf-11. The index of comparison |-nћլu-| can also occur with a denominal relational verb
    (e.g. to be an old woman) or with the verb to choose, prefer  cf. § 45.1.4.
102 Morphological preliminariesfixes involved. A good number of apparently ambivalent stems in CAY (listed
in § 10.4) may not be a problem to be dealt with using the so-called zero-
derived transcategorial conversions.   i) Stem and inflection  Only one stem occurs in each word (as stated). The
single-stem principle is very strict in CAY word formation, implying the com-
plete avoidance of stem compounding apart from a few cases of phrasal com-
pounds (single words, as stated) as morphological anomalies (§ 2.3, § 4.3.6) and
of noun incorporation as a means of compounding noun and verb stems.
   Inflection, which consists of one, two, or three inflectional suffixes that are
often fused, encodes the obligatory categories of:
   a. mood and person (subject and object) for verbs  § 32
   b. case, number, and person (possessor) for nominals  § 21 through § 29.    ii) Derivation  Between the stem and the inflection there may optionally
occur another constituent, i.e. one or more derivational suffixes. The order of
the three constituents cannot be permutated.
    Thus the structure of inflecting words  nominals (N) and verbs (V)  is rep-
resented by example (1) above and exemplified by (2) and (3), etc.
    In CAY, tense-aspect is optionally provided by verbal derivation (verb-
elaborating VVt suffixes; § 42) or lexically by some particles. Modality and
evidentiality are likewise provided optionally by verb elaborating suffixes
(modal VVm; § 43) or by some particles but also partly an inflectional category
(for illocutionary force; declaratives, interrogatives, imperatives, and optatives,
see § 46 through § 49). Polarity or verbal negation (VVn) is expressed by nega-
tive suffixes (§ 44).    iii) Two kinds of suffixes  derivational and inflectional, the former of which
forms a semi-closed class and the latter a closed class, are morphologically dis-
tinct. While derivational suffixes are a lexical means of creating new words,
they also have extensive syntactic relevance. The notion that derivational suf-
fixes are unproductive while inflectional ones are productive is totally alien to
CAY. Concerning the distinction between the two, Mithun (1983: 238) once
suggested that expressions which speakers of the language may have thought to
be more important at one stage have been morphologized into (derivational)
suffixes while the most important ones that they determined to be obligatory
have been morphologized into inflections.   iv) Roots  A good number of stems cannot be followed directly by inflec-
tions unless immediately expanded by one of a limited number of (derivational)
suffixes. They are referred to as roots (§ 10.5) and the expanding suffixes as
root expanders (EX), some of which are specific to roots while others are not.
A root followed by a root expander functions as a stem (root-derived stem;
                                                     Word and its constructions   103§ 36), which then can be followed by inflections with or without intervening
derivational suffix(es).
    It is to be noted that many roots are more or less indeterminate as to being
either nominal or verbal  see § 10.5. Verbal roots have no valency, i.e. a-
valent. All demonstratives (§ 12) and some ignoratives (§ 15.2) begin with
roots. Demonstrative roots are expanded into nominal, adverbial, and verbal
demonstrative stems by their particular expanders (§ 12.2, § 12.3, § 12.4).","[153, 154, 155]"

not to (negative conative; § 44). Possible with a complex verb as in (31). A
composite suffix |-ƾQDTWXћլ-| (emphatic) to try hard to is illustrated in (34)

"    VVn |-nћլilkuћլc-| to try (to be careful) not to, to keep oneself from ing

conative VVm |-ƾQDTѠ-| and |-saaћ-| to try to (§ 43), perhaps comes from the
general negator |-nћլit-| and inchoative |ƾXћլc-| to become, though with the
intervening -k- difficult to determine.(17)      qane-nrilkurt-uq

Foreword
This is a grammatical description of Central Alaskan Yupik (CAY hereafter),
an Eskimo Language spoken traditionally in small villages in Southwest Alas-
ka, but now also in major Alaskan cities outside the traditional Yupik-speaking
areas, by those people who have moved to or, in an increasing number of cases,
been born in the urban areas among dominantly English speakers. Yupik, pro-
nounced as [yúppik], is the self-designation of the people, meaning a real per-
son (yu-pik person-genuine).
   Of CAY dialects, of which there are at least five (as given in § 1.2), General
Central Yupik (GCAY), as it is called, is the target of this documentation,
which is basically a largely revised and expanded version, with extensive re-
modeling, of the same author's Sketch of Central Alaskan Yupik, an Eskimoan
Language (Miyaoka 1996) in the Smithsonian's Handbook of North American
Indians, Vol. 17, Languages. More or less heavier emphasis is laid upon the
Kuskokwim, Coast area, and Nelson Island dialects, followed by the Lower
Yukon (see below for the dialects).
   This, however, comes with an important caveat. Like any living language,
CAY should never be considered as a single stable or monolithic entity. It is
very often the case that each village or small local area is perceived (and clearly
pointed out) as having its own dialectal characteristics by which it is easily
discerned from another. It is full of generational and idiolectal variations and
vacillations within itself, in addition to dialectal differences, particularly in
matters lexical. This may particularly be the case with a language such as CAY,
which has not only a very wide area of distribution and is experiencing very
rapid acculturation and decline under the strong pressures of the predominant
language (English) and culture (American), but which has been further influ-
enced by different degrees of outside influences, depending upon family and
individual history, intermarriage and school education, etc. See § 1.3 for post-
contact and current status.    i) It cannot be over-stressed that the Yupik people tend to be reluctant to
generalize things in their environment (social, natural and supernatural), to say
nothing of their language. Crude generalizations in matters linguistic may be
easily doubted and flatly rejected, as is the case with their non-linguistic cul-
ture. Their traditional teaching of children in general is based on concrete illus-
trations and telling stories rather than abstract explanations, very much unlike
teaching in American schools. Morrow and Mather (1994: 40), long-time non-
Native and Native collaborators in matters anthropological, speak of the ten-
x Foreworddency of the people to avoid generalized analyses of meaning and motivation
and to see the academic predilection for critical analysis as leading people
from meaning toward discord and confusion.
    This applies all the more so to the language in such matters as acceptability
of lexical items of wide range and some grammatical usages (due to their rapid
decline among non-conservative speakers). Most conspicuous to the speakers,
however, is nothing but lexicon instead of grammatical patterns. A remarkable
fact is that Yupik people are very sensitive to lexical differences in actual
speech of other persons even among ones own family, so it is frequently ob-
served that people argue against one another either for fun or seriously. They
may also be very much aware of some phonological differences of their
(sub)dialects (but hardly of grammar). Not surprisingly, Yupik speakers often
let slip that there seems to be neither such a thing as a coherent language (as
CAY), a typical dialect (as GCAY or even Kuskokwim), nor a representative
speaker (either of the language or a dialect).    ii) Fully aware that neat and easy generalizations about a language are
doomed to fail, this writer has taken care, within practical (individual or social)
limitations, to avoid hasty generalizations by constantly cross-checking any
piece of information obtained with as many speakers as possible. Accordingly,
everywhere in this description, utmost cautions are taken to avoid hard and fast
generalizations or inflexible conclusions in all instances, which some readers
might prefer to have. Every speaker, however, may readily find many examples
(words or sentences) cited in this grammar that he or she openly claims are not
my language or just say no. It would not be surprising to find many Yupik
illustrations acceptable only to a portion of CAY speakers and subject to disa-
greements (responding no) from other speakers, since acceptability in general
varies, empirically speaking, to a considerable extent according to speakers, not
only between regions, but even within families  moreover, meaning of no by
speakers needs to be correctly judged with the utmost care, since it may not
necessarily be grammatical or idiolectal/dialectal, but may be pragmat-
ic/contextual, a mere personal preference, etc. Modest experience with the lan-
guage will lead one to conclude that it would be practically impossible indeed
to find a representative speaker of CAY or a single speaker who will accept
(nearly) all the Yupik examples in this documentation without reservations.

tive constructions, in particular, aside from vocabulary.   iii) CAY is a very rich and expressive language with fine grades of semantic
and functional distinction made within words. Although I have striven to exam-
ine the subject as assiduously and comprehensively as my abilities and oppor-
tunities allow, this grammar is necessarily far from an exhaustive or a definitive
treatment. Yupik examples, which are chosen to be as illustrative as possible of
the point under discussion, are reduced to the minimum for this book under
space limitation. Accordingly, the grammatical description presented here may
hardly be anything but an abstraction (which the people dislike). Even aside
from the speakers different responses, which are to be duly expected, this is
inevitably another grammar which leaks (Sapir 1921: 39). There is of course
a multitude of points that will need correction, revision, and deeper understand-
ing. As such, even after many years of studying CAY, this book admittedly
remains a merely preliminary stage for a fuller grammatical documentation and
explanation. It must be so, given that a hundred linguists working a hundred
years could not get to the bottom of (fully document and explain) a single lan-
guage (Krauss 2007: 16).    iv) Obviously this is an old-fashioned grammar that is not fortified by re-
cent theoretical formulations. However, it is not a beginners school grammar
either and demands a certain extent of linguistic background. It is intended to
be something that will be of interest not only to non-speakers (either linguists
or not) who are interested in the current language, its depth and subtleties, but
also be of some help to the present and future speakers who will appreciate the
beauty, richness, intricacy, and orderliness of the language. Despite some pos-
sible prejudices among speakers against an academic grammar, this will, I hope,
be something to help understand the language and serve to explain part of the
fluent speakers inner (unconscious) knowledge of it. In addition, proper
awareness of phonological rules (§ 7) will help to avoid easy etymologizing or
metanalysis of words (morphemes), which the simple phonological system
(with only four vowels) of the language may tempt ones to do. (A deep root
may be not more than a conjecture.) The last thing I want is to produce more
material only for theoretical tinkerings or dilettantish hasty hypotheses.
    Based upon my comprehension that the genuine object of linguistics is a
word (§ 2), this is a morphology-based description, which does not mean that
syntactic phenomena are slighted. In this language particularly, to my percep-
tion, morphology and syntax are too interwoven to validate separate treatments
(cf. Part 1 Preliminaries). The foregoing documentation consists of a fundamen-
tal grammar as its main part, accompanied by a suffix list and references, to-
gether with (recorded) sources for the language. However, it remains nothing
xii Forewordbut an ever on-going work subject to constant correction and revision. Any
comment and suggestion, factual and interpretational, would be fully appreciat-
ed.
    Three different writing systems co-exist in this publication: phonological
and phonemic representation (both in academic symbols) as well as the current-
ly adopted practical orthography (as explained in § 3). What may seem re-
dundant, especially in early chapters, will, I hope, serve to help propagate the
orthography currently enjoying a greater acceptance and usage in traditional
Yupik-speaking areas and beyond.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"   See also Miyaoka (1967: 107109) for more. Some of them have Aleut cog-
nates as connected by Bergsland, e.g. qam(i)- eyebrow (1994: 306, 527), and
Fortescque et. al (1994: 408) gives a proto-Eskimo suffix -lu(ћլ) place or thing
(for performing action). On the other hand, this obsolete suffix is suggested as
the origin of the appositional (cosubordinate) mood marker |+lu| (§ 51.1.1) by
Mithun (2008: 98).

Nominal elaboration is responsible for the semantic elaboration of preceding
nominal stems. The semantic function of nominal-expanding (NN) suffixes
generally consists in bringing about a more or less concrete adjectival elabora-
tion (e.g. big) or secondary modification (§ 20.1). A small part of NN suffixes
give merely a slight associative elaboration on the preceding stems (generally
of certain semantic categories) and are often very opaque in content (§ 20.2). A
fair number of (dis)honorific NN suffixes express positive or negative atti-
tudes to persons or some living things, and they are also used as VV suffixes
(§ 20.3). Besides (dis)honorifics, many NN suffixes may also serve as one or
more other types, i.e. VN, NV, VV.
    Some NN suffixes, which occur in a considerable number of stems, are how-
ever oblique and no longer productive. Only the more or less productive NN
suffixes are given below.","[697, 698]"
"The Yukon version of the most common greeting-like expression is cangac-it?
(what.amiss-INT.2sg.). It may carry negative connotations (something is
wrong with you?), and some elders do not seem to like this. There is another

    The former (NV type) includes formation of relational verbs (§ 37; NVrv),
i.e. copula-like transcategorial (denominal) verbs, and of non-relational verbali-
zations (§ 38; NV). There are important syntactic differences between relational
and non-relational denominalized verbs (§ 37.5) that should be clearly distin-
guished. Most of (denominal) verbal derivations are treated as incorporation by
Sadock (1980), that is, object incorporation and non-object incorporation (of
predicate nominals for relational verbs and of allative-case NPs).
    The latter (VV type) includes valency modification (VVsm; § 39 for simplex
verbs and VVcm § 40 for complex verbs), and non-valency elaboration with
various verbal categories (grammatical or lexical) such as adverbial in a wide
sense (VVa; § 41), tense-aspect (VVt; § 42), modality (VVm; § 43), polarity or
negation (VVn; § 44), evidentiality (VVe; § 43), and comparison (VVc; § 45).
As is generally the case with the functional classes of suffixes, many VV suffix-
es may also be NN, VN, or NV (as given after the slash).

Relational (equational) verbs (NVrv)
CAY does not have the so-called copula construction with two arguments
involved (copula subject and copula complement; Curnow 2001, Dixon
2002) which encodes equation, identity, or group membership between the two
participants (e.g. X is Y).
    The CAY copula-like transcategorial relational verbs are not only intransi-
tive with S argument, but also transitive with A and P involved. The participant
X is expressed by an NP in the S or P function, while Y is a referent of the head
(noun stem) of the denominal verb. It is a possessor Z of Y that is referred by
the A argument (like X is Zs Y).
    Relational verbs are distinguished from non-relational verbalizations (§ 38).","[1032, 1033, 1034, 1035]"
"   In the practical orthography the question marker |qaa| is generally written
with a hyphen, as it has commonly been considered an enclitic. It in fact be-
haves like an enclitic in being dependently attached to its head word at the be-
ginning of a sentence. Prosodically speaking, however, it is more of a non-
enclitic particle than an enclitic. Its prosody or accentuation pattern does not
show an enclitic bound phrase but a non-enclitic bound phrase and can occur
independently by itself (is it so/right?)  cf. § 43 and § 53.3㸬 In this grammar
the unequal sign (), instead of the equal sign, is employed to indicate the de-
pendently used particle:(181)       Aana-qaa / $DQDTDD      /aánà(q)  TDD/ (is it, do you mean) mother?

             Note the regressive accent with gemination on /q/ by (P18iv.a  but
            not P18ii) before TDD but its absence before =mi in the compared.   ii) to distinguish a non-native stem. There are a considerable number of
words incorporated into (and established as part of) Yupik lexical stock from
Russian and some neighboring native languages such as Inupiaq, Aleut, and the
Athabaskan languages. English has also contributed loanwords, but far fewer
than Russian.

   Although bilingual Yupik speakers are beginning to mix their speech with an
increasing number of English words, most of them have not been incorporated
as Yupik stems but clearly remain and are perceived as non-native elements.
Such un-incorporated non-native words, whether nouns or verbs, have to be
separated by the linker |+(V~VV)ћլ-| (LNK  § 52.5.2) from its following native
suffix, derivational or inflectional, and a hyphen has to be inserted between the
non-native stem and the linker.(182) a. líbràry-q      ~ library-mi              library (ABS.sg. ~ LOC.sg.)
