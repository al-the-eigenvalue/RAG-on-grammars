7.7.7 Negative
Negative polarity in Ik depends on the irrealis-realis distinction for
morphological manifestation. In other words, there is no independent
marking for polarity, in particular for negative polarity. Negation is
expressed in Ik with a combination of highly irregular negating verbs and
modal suffixes (irrealis or realis). This section presents only a brief
summary; see §10.13 for a more complete discussion of negation.",[392]

In (252), the noun ɲɛƙɛ- receives a H tone on its first syllable as a result of
high-tone insertion disrupting a sequence of more than three L tones.
                                                                                  557
9.16.4 Negative tags
Ik has two negative ‘tags’ that can be used following either positive or
negative statements. When they are used, the speaker normally expects a
corresponding positive reply. These tags and their replies are as follows:
(254)   Nta ƙamatii?                              Ƙamatadǃ
        ńt-á       ƙám-átì=ìINTERROG              ƙám-át-a=dᵉ
        not-REAL be.like-3PL[IRR]=DP              be.like-3PL-REAL=DP
        Are they (i.e. words) not like that? They are like thatǃ
(255)   ...keɗe benia nti?                        Ntia ʝaǃ
        keɗe      beni-a           ńtí            ńtí-a=ʝa
        or        not.be-REAL like.that           like.that=ADV
        ...or is it not like that?                Just like thatǃ
Finally, Ik has both positive and negative independent polarity particles:
ee/éé ‘yes’ and ńtóodó ‘no’. The particle ńtóodó seems to be morphologically
complex, though it cannot be fully parsed out. In any case, it seems to
incorporate the negator verb ńt-. In Ik, contrary to English, a negative reply
to a negative question can be preceded by ee/éé ‘yes’, and positive reply to a
negative question can be preceded by ńtóodó ‘no’. Consider the following:
(256)   Negative question:                 Nta beɗidi?
                                           ńt-á              bɛ́ɗ-ɪ ́dɪINTERROG
                                                                        ̀
                                           not-REAL          want-2SG [IRR]
                                           Don’t you want (it)?","[588, 589]"
"
The verbs in (48) form a subset based on the fact that they all aspectually
modify    a      morphologically    defective,     semantically    main   verb.   The
‘anticipative’ verb ŋɔ́r- ‘do early’ is most likely related to the proto-Kalenjin
verb ŋɔɔr- ‘foretell’ (Rottland 1989). And the verb sár- is functionally quite
similar to the Turkana auxiliary -rok- which Dimmendaal calls the “auxiliary
of unexpected state of affairs” in the affirmative (1983:138) and the
“unexpected negative perfective” in the negative (1983:457).",[517]
"
In this third and final example, the singular anaphoric pronoun =ꜜdéé
comes between the CA and the RC, with no intervening relative pronoun:
504
(103)   ama dee bara
        ám-á=ꜜdéé                 [bar-a]RC
        person-NOM=ANPH.SG        rich-REAL
        that rich person (lit. ‘that person (who is) rich’)
The number of verb-form types allowed in an Ik relative clause is restricted.
For positive polarity, only realis forms are allowed. For negative polarity,
only irrealis forms are allowed. Other forms, like sequential, simultaneous,
and optative, cannot function as the predicate of a relative clause.","[535, 536]"
"
The sequential impersonal passive cannot be negated in and of itself. If a
clause with the SPS needs to be negated, the sequential aspect negator moo is
employed with the second (negated) verb in the impersonal passive voice.
To illustrate this, (219) presents an affirmative sequential impersonal
passive sentence, followed by its negative version in (220):
396
(219)   Honetiakoo ragw, ceiƙweesed.
        hɔ́n-ɛ́t-ɪa-kɔ́=ɔ          ráɡw-ᵃ       cɛ-ɪ ́ƙɔ́-ɛsɛ́=dᵋ
        drive-VEN-1SG-SEQ=DP ox-NOM             kill-COMP-SPS=DP
        With that I drove an ox, and it was killed (from that).","[427, 428]"
"
With the conjunction naˊ=, the type of conditional clauses shown above
have a present, gnomic, or even future tense. But they may also be put in
the past tenses with the addition of the past tense particles, as in:
(132)   Past-tense conditional clauses
        na=ƙáyukᵒ,…             ‘If she goes,…’
        na=náá ƙayukᵒ,…         ‘If she had gone (earlier today),…’
        ná=bee ƙayukᵒ,…         ‘If she had gone (yesterday),…’
        na=noo ƙáyukᵒ,…         ‘If she had gone (a while ago)…’
                                                                                    515
Conditional clauses may be negated through the use of the sequential
negating verb moo/noo following the conjunction naˊ=. And whereas
affirmative conditional clauses contain verbs in the sequential aspect,
negated conditional clauses contain the bare negative (irrealis) verb form:
(133)   Naa noo ƙai, iryametima ŋitsanik.
        [na=nó-ó          ƙa-ⁱ]COND       iryám-ét-ima            ŋɪ ́tsanɪ ́-kᵋ
        CONJ =not-SEQ     go-3SG[IRR] get-VEN-1PL.EXC[SEQ]        problems-DAT
        If he doesn’t go, we’ll get into trouble.","[546, 547]"
"
Semantically, these prohibitives are ‘irrealis’ in the sense that the
predication has not happened and is even forbidden from happening.
However, grammatically, the Ik prohibitive is marked as ‘realis’ with the
realis suffix {-a} (implying temporal actuality) on both the negating verb
and the complemental main verb. This kind of ‘polarity reversal’—where
negative imperatives occur with realis suffixes—is reportedly only rarely
attested in other languages around the world (Dixon 2012:112).",[587]
"
Negated imperatives—prohibitives— are significantly different in form from
the affirmative ones. They involve the highly irregular negating verbs ma-
/na- and the particle eʝá plus the negated verb as a complement in the realis
mood with subject-agreement suffixes. Prohibitives are touched on in the
next section and more fully treated ahead in §10.13.",[392]
"
9.12.4 Tags
Ever given to rhetorical flourishes, Ik speakers may use one of several
interrogative ‘tags’ to solicit a response from those listening to their speech.
Each of the tags is a negated polar question to which the expected response
is in the affirmative. The following two are representative:
(191)   Benia ntia?                                  Nti.
        beni-a          ńtíâINTERROG                 ńtí
        not.be-REAL like.that                        like.that
        Is it not so?                                (It is) so.",[566]
"
9.16.3 Copula clauses
Although the copula of identity (mɪt-) and the copula of cocation (i-) can be
negated with either negator verb, Ik also has two lexical verbs that function
as negative copulae. These negative copulae seem to have been (partly)
grammaticalized from the synchronic lexical verbs bɪrá- ‘lack’ and bení- ‘be
unique’. The sentences below illustrate both ways copular verbs can be
negated—first with negator verbs and second with negative copulae. Note
how morphological case suffixes change going from one type to the other:
(248)   Nta ntsa iyi awak.
        ńt-á          nts-a         i-i   awá-kᵉ
        not-REAL      s/he-NOM      be-3SG home-DAT
        She’s not at home.
556
(249)   Biraa ntsa awao.
        bɪra-a         nts-a          awá-ᵒ
        not.be-REAL s/he-NOM          home-ABL
        She’s not at home (lit. ‘She lacks from home.’).","[587, 588]"
"
(124)   Atsuo ƙaano beɗetano ƙaƙaaƙo.
        ats-úó         ƙá-áno           bɛ́ɗ-ɛ́t-ano            ƙaƙa-aƙɔ-∅
        come-IMP       go-1PL.INC[OPT ] want-VEN-1PL.INC[OPT ] hunt-inside-ABL
        Come let’s go, let’s look for (it) while hunting.
356
7.7.5 Subjunctive
The subjunctive mood (along with negative polarity) is the quintessential
irrealis mood in that it is zero-marked. That is, it is recognized
morphologically by the subject-agreement suffixes surfacing in their
underlying forms. Syntactically, it is recognized by a couple of conjunctions.","[387, 388]"
"
In terms of etymology, Ehret links the copula mɪt- (which is mɛt- in the
Kuliak language So; Carlin 1993:65) to the Proto-Nilo-Saharan root *méːy ‘to
do, make’ (2001:281). But how that may have developed into a copula is
not obvious. Also unexplained is the link between i- and the Proto-Central-
Sudanic *nɡwi ‘to be (somewhere)’ > Central Sudanic *-i (Ehret 2001:371).
In neighboring Teso-Turkana languages, two of the three Ik copula verbs
have what appear to be close cognates: Ik i- ↔ Teso-Turkana (a)yákáʊ̥̀ ‘to be
somewhere’ and Ik ir- ↔ (a)rakaʊ̥ ‘to be something/ somehow’.
492
Ik also has a pair of negative copula verbs: bení- ‘not be (something)’ and
bɪrá- ‘not be (somewhere)’. The first negates mɪt- and ir-, while the second
negates i-. Both verbs have other, lexical meanings. The verb bení- can mean
‘be unique’, while bɪrá- can mean ‘lack’. In their capacity as negative copula
verbs, these two verbs take complements with a variety of cases:
(71)    Negative copula verbs
                          Copula   CS     CC
        Identity          bení-    NOM    COP/OBL        Possession        bení-    NOM    GEN        Attribution       bení-    NOM    adverb
        Location          bɪrá-    NOM    ABL/ACC        Existence         bɪrá-    NOM    (ABL)
And the following examples illustrate actual usage of the negative copulae:
(72)    Mita bi.                         Benia buk.
        mɪt-a       bi                   beni-á          bu-kᵒ
        be-REAL you.SG[OBL]              not.be-REAL you.SG- COP
        It’s you.                        It’s not you.","[523, 524]"
"
And unlike the past-tense clitics, the freely occuring non-past tense
adverbials can precede or follow the negated verb in a negative clause, e.g.:
(298)   Nta tsʼoo ƙoi.                          Nta ƙoii tsʼoo.
        ńt-á           tsʼɔɔ   ƙó-íⁱ            ńt-á           ƙó-íí       tsʼɔɔ
        not-REAL       PRES    go-1SG[IRR]      not-REAL       go-1SG[IRR] PRES
        I’m not going now.                      I’m not going now.
424
7.12 Epistemic qualification
Ik employs three methods for qualifying the certainty of knowledge
expressed in a statement. Knowledge that is not completely certain, that is
made on inference from observed evidence, may be expressed with a set of
morphologically complex ‘inferential’ particles (§7.12.1). Knowledge gained
counter-expectationally is marked at the clausal level through a special
combination of verbal modality and nominal case marking (§7.12.2). And
lastly, knowledge expressed as a way to confirm a state of affairs is marked
by a special usage of temporal particles (§7.12.3). Quite unlike evidentiality
in some other languages, these epistemic devices are not part of an
obligatory inflectional system in Ik. They are simply an available means to
qualify the status of one’s knowledge communicated in a proposition.","[455, 456]"
"
9.12.1 Polar questions
Polar questions generally expect a simple confirmation or denial as a
response. The response can be ‘yes’ (éé/ee) or ‘no’ (ńtóodó) or a repetition of
the question in the affirmative. Such questions in Ik are recognized by two
characteristics: 1) They end with the non-final allomorph of the last
morpheme in the question (as opposed to the final form in an Indicative
sentence), and 2) the last mora of the question takes a low boundary tone:
(166)   Maraŋa?                              Maraŋǃ
        maráŋ-à                           maráŋ-∅                 good-REAL                            good-REAL
        Is it good?                          It’s good.",[558]
"
Ik can only negate full dependent and independent clauses. It has no
derivational processes for creating negative lexemes. Neither can smaller
clausal constituents like noun phrases be negated morphologically. They can
be negated syntactically and semanticaly by first being topicalized. To
illustrate this, the verb bɪrá- ‘not be’ in the following sentences negates
various clausal arguments that are modified by headless relative clauses:
(243)   Biraa ama iya naye na.
        bɪra-a       ám-á             i-a          naí-é=na
        not.be-REAL person- NOM       be-REAL      here- DAT =DEM.SG
        Nobody is here (Lit. ‘There is no person (who) is here.’).",[586]
"
As described earlier (§9.10.1), Ik verbless copulative clauses consist of
nouns inflected with the copulative case suffix {-kɔ}. These clauses are
negated with the negative copula bení-. When this occurs, the complement
of the negative copula can take either the nominative or copulative case.
(252)   Ɲeƙek.                        Benia ɲeƙek.
        ɲɛƙɛ-kᵓ                       beni-a         ɲɛ́ƙɛ-kᵓ
        hunger- COP                   not.be-REAL hunger-COP
        It’s hunger.                  It’s not hunger.",[588]
"
A ‘basic clause’ is defined here is a simple, declarative statement with a 3SG
subject, realis modality, and positive polarity—in other words, functionally
and semantically unmarked. As noted above, the order of core constituents
480
in an Ik basic clause is VSO, or more precisely, VS in intransitive clauses and
VAO in transitive clauses. In (30) below, the noun ŋókᵃ ‘dog’ is functioning
as the subject of the intransitive predicate ep- ‘sleep’. And in (31), the same
noun is acting as the subject of the transitive predicate átsʼ- ‘gnaw’ with ɔká-
‘bone’ as its object. Note how the subject follows the verb in each example,
and how the object follows the subject in (31):
(30)    Epa ŋok.
        ep-aV          ŋók-ᵃS             Intransitive=VS
        sleep-REAL dog-NOM
        The dog is asleep.","[511, 512]"
"
7.7.1 Irrealis
The irrealis modality in Ik is zero-marked. When pertinent, the zero-marking
may be glossed in square brackets as [IRR], but otherwise it will not be
reflected in the glossing of examples (as opposed to realis). As mentioned
above, the irrealis modality is reserved for predications whose temporal
realization is not grammatically encoded. Irrealis is the base form for a
variety of modal and aspectual categories, including the following:
(97)    Negative past:           Maa atsid.
                                 má-á         ats-ídⁱ
                                 not-REAL     come-2SG[IRR]
                                 You haven’t come.
                                                                         347
(98)    Negative non-past:       Nta atsid.
                                 ńt-á          ats-ídⁱ
                                 not-REAL      come-2SG[IRR]
                                 You don’t come.","[378, 379]"
"
9.15.4 Superlative clauses
Ik also has no special construction to express superlativeness either. Instead,
it simply adds the adjective muɲu ‘all’ to modify the standard in Type F
comparative constructions, making the standard a universal plural, e.g.:
(234)   Toda maraŋie iloyoo roɓaa muɲ.
        tód-a         maráŋ-í-e        ɪlɔ́-ɪ ́-ɔ           roɓa-a   muɲ
        speak-REAL good-3SG-SIML       defeat-3SG-SEQ people-ACC all
        He speaks better than everyone else (lit. ‘and defeats all people’).
550
9.16 Negation
Negation in Ik is signaled by a combination of highly irregular, paradigm-
less negator verbs (235 below) and irrealis marking on the negated verb.
The negator verbs show agreement for an impersonal 3-person subject. One
of them, ńt-, always appears in the realis modality with a negated
complemental main verb in the irrealis modality. The other, ma-/na-, can
appear in either the realis or irrealis modalities (in the sequential aspect as
moo/noo). For past and present perfect tenses, its verbal complement is in
the irrealis modality, while for prohibitives (negative imperatives), the
complement is in the realis modality. Beyond these two negator verbs, two
lexical verbs, bɪrá- and bení-, are used to negate copula of location and
copula of identity verbs, respectively. The table in (235) presents the
negator verbs with the verb and clause types they can negate:
(235)     Ik negator verbs
                             Verb type             Clause type
          ńt-                Non-past realis       Main
          ma-/na-            a) Past realis        Main
                             b) Present perfect    Main
                             c) Imperative         Main
          (as mo-o/no-o)     d) Irrealis           Subordinate
The negating morphemes presented in (235) are analyzed here as defective
verbs rather than merely negating particles for the following reasons:
      1. They fill the clause-initial slot, which is reserved for the main verb.
      2. They take modal suffixes (e.g. realis {-a} and sequential {-(k)ɔ}).
      3. The negator ma-/na- can be modified by tense enclitics, which only
          modify the clause predicate.
      4. The irrealis (sequential) negator moo/noo can bear the dummy
          pronominal enclitic {=ˊdɛ}, which otherwise attaches only to verbs.
                                                                            551
In terms of etymology, the Ik negator verbs can be traced to ancient proto-
Nilo-Saharan forms (Ehret 2001:218-223). The realis-negating verb ńt- likely
originates in the proto-‘Northern Sudanic’ suffix *-to that is believed to have
also negated indicative clauses. Though perhaps this ancient negator crossed
phyletic boundaries into Afroasiatic, if the Cushitic language Afar’s defective
negating morpheme -innio is any indication (Mahaffy, n.d., p. 33).
According to Ehret, the prefix n- in the Ik ńt- developed as an independent
morpheme, though its function may not be reconstructable today.","[581, 582, 583]"
"
The next example features a complement clause functioning as the copula
complement (CC) of the negative copula verb bení-. With this verb, CCs
typically take the copulative case, and this sentence is no exception:
(196)   Benia toimenoo mitida ceki na gaan.
        beni-a      [toimɛnɔ-ɔ [mɪt-ɪ ́d-a     ceki=ná            ɡaan-∅] CoCl]CC
        not.be-REAL COMPL-COP be-2SG-REAL woman[OBL]=REL.SG bad-REAL
        It’s not that you are a bad woman.",[568]
"
This third example shows the affirmative durative Auxiliary sár- modifying
the intransitive verb kom- ‘be many’:
(51)    Sarima koma zuk.
        sár-ím-aAUX             kom-aV     zukᵘ
        still-1PL.EXC-REAL      many-REAL very
        We are still very many.",[518]
"
In this second example, the conjunction (í)koteré introduces a third person
negative imperative whose expressed purpose is that people do not laugh:
                                                                                    511
(122)   Taa kotere maa roɓa fek.
        taa      [kóteré má-á            roɓ-a          fek-ᵃ]PURPOSE
        QUOT     so.that not-REAL        people- NOM laugh-REAL
        (That) so that people don’t laugh.","[542, 543]"
"
In principle, any word, phrase, clause, or sentence in the language can be
questioned in a way that expects a confirmation or denial. Whatever
grammatical category the questioned element belongs to, it will be in its
non-final form together with the low boundary tone of interrogative

intonation. In (172) and (173), it is a simple NP that has been questioned,
whereas in (174), a simultaneous subordinate clause is under query:
(172)   Ntsa?                                 Ee, nts.
        nts-à INTERROG                        ee         nts-∅
        s/he-NOM                              yes        s/he-NOM
        She?                                  Yes, she.","[559, 560]"
"
To negate the kind of possessive clause in (24), one has to substitute the
negative locative copula (bɪrá- ‘not be there’) and put the possessor (or more
precisely, the ‘un-possessor’) in the ablative case:
(25)    Biraa ɲakalama ncu.
        bɪra-a        ɲákalám-a ɲcu-∅
        not.be-REAL pen-NOM        I-ABL
        I have no pen (lit. ‘A pen lacks from me’).",[509]
"
The third function of the copulative is to mark the complement of a copula
clause (CC) with the negative copula bení-. If the copula subject (CS) is
mentioned, as in (169) and (170), then it appears in the nominative case:
(168)   Benia ʝa ngok.
        beni-a=ʝá              ŋɡó-kᵒCC
        not.be-REAL=ADV        we.EXC-COP
        It’s really not us.",[319]
"
The table in (114) illustrates the complex optative-marking strategy with
full optative paradigms for the verbs fút-és ‘to blow’ and bɛr-ɛ́s ‘to build’:
                                                                            353

        3PL        fút-átiˊ          bɛr-átiˊ
The optative mood is used to express a wish, even an ironic negative wish in
the form of a resignation. And with the appropriate auxiliary verb, the
optative has been grammaticalized into use as an irrealis narrative mood.","[384, 385]"
"
Despite what the preceding sentences show, complements of the negative
copula of identity bení- can also appear in the nominative case. Or perhaps
in the following two examples, the nouns in the nominative case are in fact
the copula subjects whose complements are understood from the context:
(171)   Benia ʝa nk.
        beni-a=ʝá              ŋ́k-ᵃCS/CC?
        not.be-REAL=ADV        I-NOM
        It’s just not me.
288
(172)   beni-á       ɗ-a CS/CC?     ɲjíní-e
        not.be-REAL one.SG-NOM we.INC-GEN
        Is it not (the one of) ours?","[319, 320]"
"
Lastly, when paired with the interrogative pronoun nꜜdɛ́ɛ ́ ‘from where’, the
simultaneous aspect can be used elliptically to form a negative statement:
(156)   Otsiike ndee?
        ots-íí-ke        nꜜdɛ́ɛ ́
        climb-1SG-SIML from.where
        I’m not climbing (lit. ‘I climbing from where?).
370
7.8.3 Imperfective
The same form—{-ɛ́s-}—encodes both intentional modality and an
imperfective aspect. Phonological and morphophonological details of this
suffix are discussed back in §7.7.3. Although they are related semantically
and probably historically, the two uses are viewed here as too far apart to
be treated as two functions of the same suffix. The Ik imperfective marked
by {-ɛ́s-} is contrasted with the perfect aspect which is the default and
unmarked aspect. In other words, without {-ɛ́s-} the meaning of many verbs
does not have the internal temporal composition of the activity or state in
view (though some verbs are lexically imperfective, such as tsuwa- ‘run’).
This does not mean that the activity or state has no temporal duration, only
that any temporal duration is not grammatically encoded. By contrast, the
imperfective aspect highlights the ongoing and unfinished nature of the
predicated situation. On this score, compare the following examples:
(157)   Ƙayuo awak.
        ƙa-i-o      awá-kᵉ
        go-3SG-SEQ home-DAT
        And he goes/went home.
(158)   Ƙeesuo awak.
        ƙe-es-ú-o       awá-kᵉ
        go-IPFV-3SG-SEQ home-DAT
        And he was/kept going home.
(157)-(158) illustrate the straightforward use of the imperfective, adding a
nuance of duration to the sense of a verb. But the imperfective can also
function in a way similar to the simultaneous, by modifying a sequential
clause with a sense of temporal duration. The sequential aspect is inherently
tenseless and perfective in aspect, so the imperfective prolongs a temporal
situation long enough for it to be simultaneous or accompanying. Consider,
for example, the imperfective verbs in the following sentences:
                                                                            371
(159)   Atsiata noo dzigwaa lotoɓae,
        ats-í-át-a=noo                   dzíɡw-aa        lɔ́tɔ́ɓa-ᵋ
        come- PLUR-3PL-REAL=PST 3 buying-ACC tobacco-GEN
        They used to come to buy tobacco,
        iyesini tumede.
        i-és-íni       tʊmɛꜜdɛ́-ɛ́
        be-IPFV -SEQ there-DAT
        (and) they were (continuously) there.","[401, 402, 403]"
"
Relative causes can be negated. To negate one, the sequential negator moo
(and allomorph noo) is used just after the relative pronoun. If the subject of
the relative clause is overt, then it follows the negator. Being negated, the
main verb of the RC then appears in its negative (irrealis) form, as in:
(104)   jejeika dii nuu moo epanid
        jéje-ik-a=ꜜdíí=[nu-u              mo-o     ep-anɪ ́=dᵋ]RC
        skins-PL-NOM=ANPH.PL=REL.PL not-SEQ sleep-IPS=DP
        those sleepings skins that were not slept on
(105)   Iya kona iresie na moo ɲotoa ɦyeat.
        i-a     kɔn-a    írési-e=[na               mo-o       ɲɔtɔ́-á   ɦye-átⁱ]RC
        be-REAL one      ceremony-GEN=REL.SG not-SEQ men- NOM know-3PL
        There is one ceremony that men do not know.",[536]
"
A complex sentence like this one embodies the language’s full-fledged
morphological case-marking system. In addition to word order and
connectives like ńda ‘with’, Ik uses this case system to mark grammatical
relations and encode semantic roles in an integral and efficient manner.
232
6.1     Case overview
        “The case marking typology of a language is surely its most central
        typological parameter, since almost all other parts of the grammar
        must interact with it.”—Talmy Givón, quoted by Serzisko (1992:50)
All Ik nominals must be inflected for case, and formal parallels of nominal
case markers are found in other diverse parts of the grammar. Due to its
grammatical centrality, the Ik case system has already been the subject of
several works (e.g. Heine 1990, König 2002, König 2008, and Schrock
2014). As König defines it, “a case system is an inflexional system of
marking nouns or noun phrases for the type of relationship they bear to
their heads… expressed by affixes, tone, accent shift, or root reduction…”
(2008:5). Out of the above list, Ik uses a combination of affixes and stem
reduction to encode case relations. The affixes are suffixes, and stem
reduction means the stem-final vowel is deleted before some case suffixes.","[263, 264]"
"
An interesting structural feature of Ik negation is that while the negator
verbs function as the main verb of the clause and are marked for an
impersonal 3SG subject, the subject of the negated verb, if overt, fills the
normal syntactic slot for subject. Compare the following sentences:
(241)   Ƙoyaa bee nk.
        ƙó-í-a=bee            ŋk-ᵃ
        go-1SG-REAL=PST2 I-NOM
        I went (yesterday).",[585]
"
In closing, the question must be asked: Is the Ik ‘copulative’ really a case?
As mentioned above, Cushitic parallels for the Ik copulative case suffix {-kɔ}
are analyzed variously as suffixes, clitics and ‘markers’ more generally. In
strictly morphological terms, the morpheme {-kɔ} certainly patterns like all
the other Ik case suffixes: 1) It has an identical segmental shape as that of
the dative and accusative cases, 2) it undergoes identical morpho-
phonological alternations as the others suffixes, and 3) it fills the same
nominal suffixal position as the other case suffixes. Then in syntactic terms,
it patterns with other cases in that it is required to mark a unique argument
(complement) in a specific clause type: a negative copula of identity clause.
Thus it is analyzed in this grammar as a ‘case’ proper, synchronically.",[320]
"
7.12.1 Inferential
When Ik speakers make an inference about something based on any
observable evidence, they may use an ‘inferential’ adverbial particle.
Because the knowledge expressed is only inferred, it has a degree of
uncertainty. This inferentiality can be translated in English with such
phrases as ‘it seems’, ‘it appears’, ‘X must have…, and ‘apparently, …’.",[456]
"
(29)    Eyakasi iyong ngaatuk.
        eyakási íyoŋ          ŋáâtuk
        be:3PL you:DAT        cows
        You have cows (lit. ‘Cows are to you’).
                                                                          479
9.3     Basic clause structure
The ‘clause’ is defined here as the minimal unit of syntactic organization
that includes a verbal element, finite or non-finite. Thus it encompasses the
‘verb phrase’ (predicate and any modifiers) and any ‘noun phrases’ (nouns
and any modifiers) needed to fill the predicate’s argument slots. The notion
of ‘verb phrase’ per se will not be dealt with further since the ‘clause’
includes the verb phrase by definition. Having discussed noun phrases in the
last section, this one takes up the topic of basic Ik clauses: unmarked main
clauses, subordinate clauses, and various types of marked main clauses.
Other specific topics covered in later sections of this chapter include
questions, reported speech, comparative constructions, and negation.","[510, 511]"
"
The true morphological marker of polar questions in Ik is the final, low
boundary-tone comprising the interrogative intonational tune. In this, Ik
differs from neighboring Teso-Turkana languages like Turkana which
append the invariable question particle -à to utterances to make a polar
question (Dimmendaal 1983:429). Heine & König posited -a as an
interrogative particle in Ik too (1996:116), but this must be based on an
incorrect analysis of the suffix {-a} which marks both nominative case and
realis modality. If either of these morphemes came clause-finally in a polar
question, it would definitely resemble the Teso-Turkana question particle.",[561]

The copulative case has the following three grammatical functions:
(163)   Copulative case grammatical functions
        1    Mark focus in a cleft construction
        2    Mark the complement of a verbless copula
        3    Mark the complement of a negative identity copula
The first function of the copulative is to mark an argument that has been
brought into discursive focus by being fronted before the main verb. The
result is a cleft-construction that means something like ‘It is X (that)...’. The
fronted constituent can be a subject, object, or any peripheral argument:
(164)   Subject:         Ngoo naa ikametim.
                         ŋɡó-ó=naa              ɪkam-ɛt-ɪ ́m-Ø
                         we.EXC-COP=PST 1       catch-VEN-1PL.EXC-REAL
                         It is we (who) captured (him).","[317, 318]"
"
A basic morphological division in the verbal system is realis-irrealis. This
division is posited more on the basis of morphology than semantics. Other
                                                                             19
verbal extensions include suffixes to nominalize the verb, give it directional
deixis, subject agreement, or non-core argument reference. And yet other
suffixes give the verb modal, aspectual, valency-changing, or polarity
properties. Most attributive (descriptive) notions are handled by intransitive
‘adjectival’ verbs in Ik. Tense, contrary to aspect and modality, is
communicated by clitics and lays out a three-level time deixis in both the
past and non-past. Ik uses a variety of strategies to express epistemic status.","[50, 51]"

7.11 Tense markers
Tense in Ik is a grammatical category that is not reflected in verbal
morphology per se but rather in a group of tense particles. The past tenses
are expressed by a class of particles analyzed as enclitics because a) they
participate in vowel harmony and b) are also in the second position of the
clause (§7.11.1). By contrast, the non-past tense particles are treated as free,
syntactically mobile adverbial words (§7.11.2).","[449, 450]"

9.12.2 Content questions
Content questions in Ik involve clauses in which a constituent has been
replaced with an interrogative word. Unlike in some languages, only one
interrogative word per question is permitted in Ik. Ik Interrogative words—
see (179) below—include those corresponding to (and therefore standing in
place of) (pro)nouns, adverbs, and verbs. Besides the interrogative words
themselves, no other special morphological or intonational means are used.
530
(179) Ik interrogative words
        INTERROG           Meaning                                Word class
        ndo-               ‘who?’                                 (pro)noun
        ndaí-/ńtá          ‘where?’                               (pro)noun
        ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɪ ́-       ‘which (sg.)?’                         (pro)noun
        ńtí-ɛ́nɪ ́-        ‘which (pl.)?’                         (pro)noun
        ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɪ ́-/ńt-   ‘when (+specified unit of time)?’      (pro)noun
        isi-               ‘what?’                                (pro)noun
                           ‘why (with DAT or ABL case)?’          (pro)noun
        ńtí                ‘how?’                                 adverb
        kɪtɔ́ós-          ‘what quality (color, shape, etc.)?’   verb
        taná-              ‘how many?’                            verb
As can be seen from (179), most Ik interrogative words are (pro)nouns and
thus inflect fully for case. Some others, like ńtɛ́- ɛ́nɪ́- ‘which (sg)?’ are
compound nouns. The adverbial interrogative ńtí ‘how’ is an invariable
particle, and the words kɪtɔ́ɔś - ‘what quality?’ and taná- ‘how many?’ are
both intransitive verbs.","[561, 562]"
"
But on a 1SG verb, the unreduced allomorph of the dummy pronoun is found
clause-medially, as shown in (90). This is apparently to avoid an interrupted
sequence of three vowels, each belonging to a distinct morpheme:
(90)    Ntsuo naa imoɗiade bik.
        ntsú-ó=naa         ɪmɔ́ɗ-ɪ ́-a=de     bi-kᵃ           (**ɪmɔ́ɗ-ɪ ́-a=e)
        it-COP=PST1        trick-1SG-REAL=DP you.SG-ACC
        That’s why I tricked you.
                                                                               343
7.7     Modals
Ik grammar specifies the non-spatial setting of utterances with a varity of
modality and aspect-marking suffixes, as well as tense-marking and
epistemic clitics and particles. This section examines the verbal affixes that
express sentential modality, that is, how speakers perceive the predication
in terms of its actuality, likelihood, or relevance. The modal notions
conveyed by these affixes include reality, necessity, and desire.","[374, 375]"
"
The confirmational construction is morphologically interrogative, in that the
final vowel is voiced in a clause-final position. For example, in the
indicative mood, one would expect the phrase in (305) ‘Yes, I did speak (to
so-and-so)’ to surface as noo tódi in Ik, with the realis {-a} devoiced or
deleted. Perhaps at a pragmatic level, the structure is functioning as a
rhetorical question whose implied response is ‘Yes, of course you spoke’.
8 Other Word ClassesIn addition to nouns and verbs—Ik’s large open word classes—the language
also has several other, closed word classes. These include quantifiers (§8.1),
demonstratives (§8.2.), adverbs (§8.3), conjunctions (§8.4), prepositions
(§8.5), interjections (§8.6), ideophones (§8.7), and infantile imperatives
(§8.8). Time expressions, while technically nouns, are discussed as a lexical
subset in §8.9. And though greetings do not make up a separate class in and
of themselves, they are used in a ritualized way that transcends whatever
word classes they consist of. For that reason, they are discussed in §8.10.","[458, 459]"
"
As seen in (196) and (197), the quotative particle taa (a phonologically
reduced form of kʊta ‘s/he says’) often accompanies toimɛna-. This particle
functions as an optional introducer of reported speech (see §9.14). The Ik
‘saying’-words toimɛna- and taa can be compared to similar forms in
neighboring Teso-Turkana languages. For example, in Karimojong, the
complementizer a-tɛmar is also the verb ‘to say’ and the quotative particle
ɛbɛ́ is an irregular 3SG form of the verb ábala, also meaning ‘to say’.",[569]
"
9.12.3 Alternative questions
So-called ‘alternative questions’ (Dixon 2012:398-400) are made possible in
Ik through the use of the disjunctive conjunction keɗe ‘or’. This conjunction
joins noun phrases in a series or whole clauses into a complex sentence.
Apart from keɗe, Ik alternative questions are not marked by any overt
morphological or prosodic means. In the examples below, keɗe joins two
534
clauses that could each constitute polar questions on their own. Together
they make up a content question whose answer will be the affirmation of
one or the other. Note that the final constituent remains in its final form:
(189)   Maraŋa keɗe gaan?
        [maráŋ-á] keɗe           [ɡaan-∅]
        good-REAL or             bad-REAL
        Is it good or (is it) bad?","[565, 566]"
"
However, Ik does not lie exclusively in either of these two groups. In a near
mirror-image of the three past tense clitics, Ik has a three-term non-past
tense system that is expressed by free, adverb-like particles. But a non-past
setting in Ik is also conveyed by the intentional modality suffix {-ɛ́s-}
(§7.7.3). So ‘future’ for Ik is a concept hinging both on tense adverbs and
verbal morphology, a combination of Dixon’s groups I and II.",[454]
"
Pitch-accent, ‘musical stress’, and ‘rule-governed prominence’ seem to be an
areal feature of East Africa. For example, in Turkana, “tonal inflection is
obligatory regardless of the underlying tone pattern of the noun stem
(Dimmendaal 1983:52). Evidence suggests that in wider Nilotic—languages
that have had a deep impact in Ik—‘quantitative’ metrical units based on
syllable   weight   or   mora-counting     interact   with   tone   assignment
(Dimmendaal 2012). Despite recent strides in understanding Ik tonology,
one still gets the impression that the key to the system lies just out of reach.

3.3.5 Intonation
In addition to lexical and phrasal tone, Ik also uses sentence-level tone or
‘intonation’ to express meaning. Intonation is understood here as the “the
use of suprasegmental features to convey ‘postlexical’ or sentence-level
pragmatic meanings in a linguistically structured way” (Ladd 1996:6, italics in
the original). The suprasegmental feature Ik uses to alter pragmatic meaning
is a boundary tone at the right edge of the relevant syntactic unit. Three
intonational boundary tones (or lack thereof) create the following three
‘tunes’ (the symbol <%> being borrowed from Ladd 1996:80):
(78)    Ik intonational tunes
        #    Name                        Defining boundary tone
        1    Indicative Tune             .................................Ø%
        2    Interrogative Tune          .................................L%
        3    Solicitive Tune             .................................LH%
The indicative tune is the default, unmarked intonational pattern used for
declarative statements. This tune is defined by an absence of change on the
tone of a clause’s final word. A morpho-syntactic correlate of this tune is
that the final morpheme of the sentence will be in its final form. Take for
example the two basic statements below, each with their pitch profiles:
(79)    Jʼeʝa naa awak.
        ʝɛʝ-a=náaꜜ              awá-kᵉ
        stay-REAL=PST1          home-DAT
        S/he stayed at home.
126
        [ʝe     ʝa           náa             a       wá                kᵉ]
In this example, the focus is on the final word, awákᵉ ‘at home’. With the
indicative tune, this word, declined in the dative case, takes the normal
pitch that its tone melody calls for: mid followed by high.","[156, 157, 158]"

9.5.1 Auxiliary verbs proper
The auxiliary verbs ‘proper’ are lexical verbs in their own right but also
double as aspectual auxiliaries. In the Ik auxiliary verb construction, the
aspectual auxiliary fills the slot for the main verb and is the only verb
marked for subject-agreement, tense, and polarity. The semantic main verb
follows in a morphologically defective form. If the clause subject is overt, it
comes between the auxiliary and the main verb, making the constituent
order of auxiliarized clauses Aux-S-V or Aux-A-V-O, the same order found in
                                                                                  485
subordinate clauses. The only inflection found on the main verb in an
auxiliary construction is the realis suffix {-a}. It remains thus, regardless of
the various inflectional suffixes the auxiliary verb may take.","[516, 517]"
"
Some Ik speakers, especially those having learned other languages, find
alternative ways to express contrast. This may be for example, by borrowing
a contrast word from Karimojong (naít) or Swahili (lakini).",[594]

Trying to capture the grammar of a living language linearly on paper is a
little like photographing an elusive wild animal. As it darts through the
underbrush, you snap your photo. What the photo captures is true: the
shape and contours of the animal, its color and patterns, its mode of
movement. But as true as the photo may be, it in no way does justice to the
living beast. In the same way, a written grammar can trace the structural
features of a language: its phonemes, morphemes, syntactic structures. But
seen in light of the living language in use, the grammar pales in comparison.
Even after completing this project, all I have to do is walk through the
neighborhood, overhear a conversation, or attend a public function to learn
something totally new about the language. After cataloguing all the
phonemes, morphemes, and many lexemes, I can still hear a string of Ik
speech whose meaning escapes me entirely. I have tried to write a true
description of Ik, but the language in use is much more colorful...and alive.",[19]

As    discussed   below    in     §6.4.1,     König   has   traced   a   chain   of
grammaticalization from an old focus marker (cf. the Cushitic parallels) to
both the copulative suffix in the nominal system and the sequential aspect
marker in the verbal system (2002:349-361). And so it would seem that the
Ik copulative case shows the traits of a transitional form between a nominal
and verbal morpheme. This might help explain its cross-categorial behavior.

6.4     ‘Case’ and grammaticalization
Formal parallels or homophones of the nominal case suffixes are found in
other subsystems of Ik grammar. These are most richly attested in the verbal
system (§6.4.1), though they are also found on demonstratives, relative
pronouns, and tense particles (§6.4.2). This homophony has led to claims
that Ik case is marked on ‘conjunctions, postpositions, prepositions, adverbs,
and even verbs’ (König 2008:81). But this is misleading because most of
these word classes are really nouns or verbs in Ik. The notion that nominal
case suffixes grammaticalized into verbal inflectional affixes is one of the
key claims of König 2002. Using her methodology, Schrock 2013 traces out
several other potential grammaticalization pathways going from nominal
case suffix to verbal affix. The picture emerging from this work is that due
to its near ubiquity, ‘case’ is a unifying structural element in the language.","[320, 321]"
