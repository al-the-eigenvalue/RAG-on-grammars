              The suf1'ixe.d elements discussed in the rollo.ing
       sections constltute a characteristic trait of Alsea morphology
      and may be best conpared, trom a f'unctional pOint or view,
      with the Chinook verbal stems that appear as s.cond elements
      of verbal compounds and that express local ideaa. l      These
      elements differ vastly from the syntactiC particles (see 99
      131-111) in two important respects: First, their position in
      relation to the other parts of a sentence is fixed and,
       secondly, they oan refer to individual words only and not to•      the whole sentence.   They may be added to verbs or nouns and
       they stand always in absolute terminal pOsition (excepting
       one or two instances where they precede the nom1.nalizing
     , suffix -.!1!!!, see § 112) following even the subjective pro-
      nouns, with which they have two other features in common;
       to wit: (1) they are preferably added to the adverbial and
      other forms that precede the verb or noun (see    s.f 36), and
    (1) Itt like the former elements, they may be incorporated into
       certain syntactiC particles (see 918).    They form but a lodlse
      unit with the words to which they are added, a feature that
      is emphasized in the texts and citations quoted in this sketch,
      by It hyphen (-) placed between the stem and the suffixed
      particle.   This hyphen is omitted whenever a phonetic law•      causes the amalgamation of the particle with the stem that
      1.   See Chinook, p. 592
•   precedes i t (5O$i9""1. 9) •
         Their function is both morphological and lencograpbic;
    that is to say, they are employed as formative elements for
    the purpose of expressing certain grammatical ideas, and they
    are also used in the formatton of 'compound) stems(seejI121.,124,156).
         In accordance with the ideas which these suffixed
    particles indicate they may be divided into the fOllowing
    four categories:
           (1)   3u.ff1xed partiel.es expressing local Idea.s.          :cal   Interrogative suffixed partioles.
           (3)   3u.f""r1xed particles indioating modality.

    character and correspond to the formative elements found in

             Reduplication in Alsee. does not seem to have any

    they express degrees of certainty and knowledge, emotional
    states, connection with preViou.sly expressed ideas, emphasis,
    exhortation, comparison, interrogation and concHttonality.

     cation oan be drawn batween the parttC..I.es disoussed in the
     suooeeding sectio.ns. the su.l'i'lxed particles (s6699120-124) and
     the adverbs (see§§ 150-153).      Ther·· are. however, other ways
     and means of distinguishing them rrom the latter elements, from
     which they differ vastly in two particular respects; first in
     reference to. the poal tion they occupy in a complex of words and.
     secondly. in regard to the various meanings which the~ imply.
     Unlike the suffixed particles, they form no unit whatsoever
     with either a preceding or following word, being phonetically
•    absolutely independent.     They may be shifted from one place to
     another without affecting, in !Ul.y way, the sense of' the sentence,
     and they ref'er rather to the whole sentence than to any speclf'ie
    , part of it.   In contradistinction to the adverbs, they are not
     always capable of expressing a de.finlte or clear idea, when
     used alo8.e.
             A majority of these expletives have no accent of their
     own, being either enclitic or proclitic.     A .few are composed
     of' two or more distinct particles and express the combined ideas
     of their component elements; soma appear in the form of verbal
     stems, while others may be verbalized or nominalized by means
     of a proper verbal and nominal suffix     (see§'§33. 155).
             All particles are used to exp ..'ess grarrmmtlcal categories•    and syntactic relations.     Their functions cover a wide range of'
     ideas, in accordance with which they may be subdivided into the

      (and prefixes) had been originally independent words that      have in the course of time ?art1.ally lost their independence

    Both are ccmpuund particles whose first element is the future
    prefix ~        (see 929).         The el.ements .:!. and II   are obscure.     The

     This typescript of the Alsea language, by Dr. Leo J. Frachtenberg, was
sent by Franz Boas to Jacobs in 1935 when he (Jacobs) condl<cted field work
with the then last surviving speaker of' Alsea, John Albert, at Oakville,
Washington. Jacobs used this FTschtenberg typescript for eliciting a large
number of forms fram Mr. Albert. Jacobs' file of such fOTI!l3 is in his
possession and has never been copied by photography. He is having a ~opy
made only of Frachtenberg's old typed grammar. A few of the pencilings on
its pages my be identified as Jacobs' handwriting, especially the scrib-
blings on pages 1 to 3. It is Jacobs' purpose to keep his OW'!! field notes
of Alsea items until that time wben he can decide who is the most suitable
professional linguist to initiate a thorough and up-to-date kind of study
of the language. Boas apparentJ.y inherited the Frachtenberg Alsea type-
script. He a:pparently transmitted that inheritance to Jacobs, in 1935.
I would prefer that the definitive study of the language be postponed until
that time when I can determine ,-,pon the ablest and most appropriate scien-
tific linguist Who can then utiliZe both Frachtenberg's and my total
materials. Meantime, Frachtenberg's typescript is properly made available,
in copied sheets, if these be placed in a proper repository, and if it also
be understood that the 1935 Jacobs file, which;res based upon FTschtenberg' s
typescript, is not being made available until a later time.",[1]

    tJ~e   b.'TO follouing        c';lteGori~s:     (1) Semi-temporal and (2) true

•   (see § 78), all semi_temporal suffixes ure treated as modal
    elements and must precede the true te':,po.t'ul sui'fixes.
             A lIlIljority of the tempor!!.l suffixes appear in two forms
    one denoting the time of transitive actions, and the other expressing
    intransitive peri'ormsnces.        '.!.he former are u::Jually compo;1ed of the
    temporal elements plus the objective suffixes (see§i 37-44) or
    are rendered by using the temporal suf'fix in conjunction with    the transitivlzin.:; prefix      l- (see ISO) i the latter include in
    their composition the intrnnsitive          -~ (see ~ 48).
             Of the several tenses that occur in Alsea the most important
    seem to be the continuative aru'l future        c:lte~ories.   which are
    expressed by a great v~riety of distinct suffixes.              All continuative
    elements are invariably '~dded to the ,,-orist form of iii. verbal stem;•   that is to say, to that forIJ. which has been amplified by means of
    a vocalic change (see    in a separate future form.
                                9' 130).   The future seems to be of utnost    importance, each senli-temporal (and even the past) tense appearing
                                       The Alsea lafi.t,~age has no distinct
    suffix for the present tense, 1.'rhieb is usually rendered by one
    of the inchoative ele-:-:ents (see     9 76).
             Practically all temporal suffixes are subject to a process    of abbreviation which consists of the droppiIlG oi' the final    syll3.-:::1es {see   9 19}, and all h~3.ve --- in ac;dition to their
    temporal character ___ also a verbaliziJlci function, chlll1.ging

            All infinitive suffixes tnlst be used in conjuntion with

    where the grouping of too many sounds in initial position has
    necessitated the drOppins of the prefiX (see§'{ 4, 14).                 J;t will
    be well to remember that, gener'llly speakine, all intransItive
     infinitives require the prefix               1:..-, while the transitive verbs
    are preceded by the prefis             ,2-'
            An analysis of the several infinitive suffixes Shows them
     to have the element          -1    in cOl'l1mon. which may be consids2ed as
    the elemsnt expressiTlb a general modal idea of an ini'initive                    or
    participial character.             Whether this      -1   Is in any way related
e   to the various other Alsea suffixes of similar structure. is a
    matter of mere conjecture.             It seems, however, that there can
    ,be no connection between the auxiliary and nominal         -1 (see 47.     5,
    115), the hzpsrati'le         -1 (see;' 69) and this formative element
     (see ~ 33).     The infinitive suffixes for transitive verbs have
    the element      -~      in connnon (see i. '74).
            In orcer to avoid a classification of the infinl tl 'Ie
    formative elements into too many sections, all these postpositions
    have been divided here. r,:.ther arbitr'lrily. into two categoriest
          (1)   Infinitive suffixes for intransitive verbs.
          (2)   Infinitive suffixes for transitive verbs.

              -xamt     refers to plural subjects (see ,84).                  It follows
    the stem directly (see, 4), or else it is preceded by the recip-    rocal     -ll!.! (see § 56), by the distributive               _sal (see S 59), by
    the ibchoative        -1 (see j 76 ) or by the continuative -~ (see
    ~ ~ 46,   '79).    In the f'irst mentioned instance it denotes, besides
    the infinitive mode. also a reciprocal Qction.                   The verbal stem
    to which this suf'fix is added nnlst be preceded by the prefix                       ~­    (see   i 30) which may be omitted, whenever the verbal stem begins
    with a cluster of consonants              (see 9 4).    Like the preceding           _!.
e   this format! va element has been rendered by the infini ti va, by a
    participle, by a nOun or by the indicative mood.                        Its etymology
    is obscure.        'I'he final ele:r.1ent is undoubtedly the general infinitive
    -1 (see 9 72 and above).           'lhe    !.   of   ~     cannot be the verbal
    sign, since that element does not occur in the infinitive mode
    (see    f 46); nor does the !!! seem to be in any Ylay related to
    the future     -E (see f 81). It is probable, however, that it    may be rel'lted to the nomna! suffix                 -xam (see ~ 111).

                 -1st      is added to transitive verbs and indicates the presence
    of a direct or indirect third person object.                    It can be used onl,-
    in co njunction with the prefix                ;e.- (see 9 32).    It follows the
    verbal stem directly or it may be preceded by SOme temporal suffix,
    or by the prono:rn1nal eleI:1ent         ~ (see     5 42) ..    The phonetic a.greement
    between this suffix, the subjective pronoun for                   t~e   inclusive dual    (aee ~ 35) and the nominal             -~ (see    9 115) is purely accidental.
    It is probable, however, that it may be                ~el·lted   to the impera.tive
e   .on (see 9 69); and it is, furthermore, conceivable that, owing to
    t..~e   presence of the intentional p_""efix. the infinitive phrase is
    ~reated as a future tense, in which case the                    -1: may be the
    suffix for the transitive future (see, 82) and the                       _.!!:,   identical
    with the sirr.i1a.r elel1ent which expresses an intransitive infinitive
    idea         (see §'~ 33, '13).   It is also possible that the           -1 may be
    the inchoative tense sisn (see            9 '16).     This sui'f'ix appears also as
    -.!l!b in accordance with the 113.;.,. permitting the interchanbe between

that has been discussed in a preceding seetion (see f                 SO).      In
any event, the vcrbal sign would seem superfluous, as both thE)prefix   !,- < and the sui'fl,x   -,!, have a discriminative function.
That a di9criminatlV6 element should be used as denoting a re-
flexive action is perfectly justified by the fact. that iIt 1:JUch
an action the performer is at the same time discriminated as the
Object of the sentence.      The form    -~     has been a.bbreviatedfrom   -xasx; it coincides phonetically with the abbreviated form

    always changed Into vowels            (£., ~. ~ and 1) when preceded by
    consonants, unlells the vocaliZation Is prevented by the insortion
    of' a weak vowel between the.!. and Z and the consonants that
    precede them (see §4).            The change takes place mostly aftere   12. !!!-. !!, ~. !:.. and!.       VocaliZation of the .! occurs more

               Phonetic changes, affecting the system of vowels,    resorted to extensively in Alsea for the plU'pose of expressing    certain grammatical ideaS.         These changes affect chiefly the    stems, a1thou@l instances are not lacking where a :formative    element has been subject to mutation; nor are they confined to    verbal stems alone.        The main idea. expressed by this process,    is that of intensity and duration of action, a.11d its importance    may be deduced from the fact, that all suffixes denoting intensity    or duration of action can be added to such stems only that have    been previously amplified by means of a vocalic chanee.               The•   most important of these formative elements are: the imitative    _tslilautx (see§ 51). the acclerativ9 -usx              (see953),    the    retardative -syautx        ~see 5 54).   the prohibitive _!!,   and-~    (seeoH6G, 71),        the infinitive suffixes        (see§§'!2-74). all    continuative e:""'ements (see979),         the past    -sal (see 983),    t~le    plural   _~    (see 485) and, 8.JYlong the noni:-tal suffixes.","[351, 352, 353]"
