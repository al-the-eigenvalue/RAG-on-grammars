       2. Indicative Irrealis pronouns, which represent the affirmative Indicative
           Irrealis (i.e., Future) as well as negative Perfective and negative non-
           Perfective clauses, share a CVV structure; while the tone melody for the
           affirmative Indicative Irrealis and negative Perfective pronouns is HL,
           that of the negative non-Perfective pronouns is LH.","[282, 283]"
"There are no negative forms corresponding to the Perfect tense. In the context of
discourse, when a Perfect verb is negated, a negative Perfective form is used (this is
similar to the neutralization of negative “past” and “anterior” forms by many speakers of
Swahili; see Dimmendaal 2000:172–3).       mì               làà4rì           )ígà                      I have eaten something

There are two negation particles used with verbs: yá and gá.",[374]
"7.5.3 Negative subject pronouns
In addition to being marked by negative particles (7.5.2), verbal negation is marked on
Indicative subject pronouns (6.1.2). Negative Indicative pronouns exhibit the CVV shape
which distinguishes Irrealis verb forms, but their tonal value varies: negative Perfective
verb forms are LH, and negative non-Perfective (negated Imperfective and Future) forms
are HL.",[375]
"Four Indicative particles are found in Mambay:       nà      (question particle; see also 4.4.2.3)
       yó      (affirmative particle)
       yá      (negative particle)
       rè      (topicalization particle)Indicative particles are used in reference to clauses as well as clause constituents. Since
the core of a clause is prototypically a verb, applying a particle to a verbal clause is
formally and functionally equivalent to applying it to the verb (see 7.6.1.1 for examples).
In the following section, each of the Indicative particles is shown (whenever attested) in a
verbless clause, with an Indicative verb, and with at least one other clause constituent.",[450]
"7.4.2.3 Subjunctive constructions with pá ‘make, do’
Finally, Optative verb forms are found in subjunctive constructions which pattern as the
object of pá ‘make, do’ (7.6.3). In this case, a periphrastic causitive construction results:                                            356

Five of the six basic inflectional categories (7.4) have corresponding negative forms
(7.5.1). The segmental and tonal form of a verb word remains constant when it is
negated. Verbal negation is instead marked by negative particles (7.5.2), and with
Indicative verb forms, by negative subject pronouns (7.5.3). A summary of negative
verbal forms is provided in 7.5.4.","[373, 374]"
"7.5.4 Summary of negative verbal forms
Negative verb forms are marked with negation particles (7.5.2) and negative subject
pronouns (7.5.3). These forms are summarized in the following table:                             Negative verbal forms in Mambay                                                          verb shape and     negative

7.6 Expansions of verbal inflection
Expanded verb forms allow for functional enrichment of the categories in the basic
inflectional system. While some are formed by means of TAM indicators (7.6.1), others
are formed using possessive constructions (7.6.2) and complex inflectional constructions,
including serial and auxiliary verb constructions (7.6.3).",[377]
"       3. Optative pronouns exhibit an invariable CV structure, whether affirmative
           or negative.",[283]
"The particle yó may also be applied to complete verbless clauses (10.1.3).       mù kwéé yó                                 you are indeed Kwe

10.1.2.3 The negative particle yá
Negation is always signalled by the clause-final negative particle yá along with some
additional indicator. For negation of an equivalence clause, yá is found in conjunction
with a third person negative non-Perfective pronoun híì (6.1.2.6) in initial subject
position.       híì          wáà           yá               he/she/it is not the chief

       3SG.INDEP chiefFor absence/non-existence clauses, a third person negative Perfective negative pronoun
hìí (6.1.2.5) is used directly before yá.       wáà     hìí           yá                    the chief is not there / there is no chief
       chief   3:PFV.NEG     NEG   cf. wáà     tògó                                the chief is there / there is a chief
       chief   beThe negative particle yá is most commonly found with verbs (7.6.1.1.1) and, like the
other Indicative particles, is found clause-finally; the marking of negation in this position
is an areal feature (Watters 2000:207). Here, yá is accompanied by a modification of the
structure of subject pronouns, which mark realis value (see 6.1.2).       míì            té’là   yá                   I am not walking / I do not walk
       1SG:NONPFV.NEG walk:VN NEG   cf. mì té’là                                    I am walking / I walk
       1SG walk:VNObjects may also be negated: modifications in tonal and segmental structure similar to
those applied to subject pronouns signal that negation concerns an object rather than the
verb or clause. This negation has the effect of focus on the object, and indicates that the
object is different item than the one which the listener expects. In the following cases,
the object’s final syllable is lengthened and a low tone is associated with it.       mìí         kó       ígàà      yá                   I didn’t see the child

"Verbal inflection is explored in 7.4. Specifically, this section treats basic inflectional
categories, which are marked length on subject pronouns and tone on subject pronouns
and verb words. It is shown that a division between Indicative and Optative mood is
fundamental to the verb system, and Indicative verb forms are also distinguished for
realis value and aspect. Negative verb forms, which pattern differently than their
affirmative counterparts, are treated separately in 7.5.",[316]
"Examples of negative Perfective forms are as follows:       mìí         hèè                 yá                           I did not climb

In some cases, a word or phrase may in itself constitute a complete utterance even though
it does not meet the minimal formal requirements for a clause (i.e., subject plus
predicate). While its significance is bound to the discourse of which is it a part, it is
syntactically independent. Items which typically pattern in this way in Mambay include
interjections, swear words, commands, vocatives and formulae as well as affirmative and
negative markers. The following serve as examples:       háá/)ààháà            ha! aha! you see? (gloating)
       haFy                  oh my! (astonishment)

In Mambay, clauses are related within a sentence by means of coordination (10.2.1) and
subordination (10.2.2). In the present discussion, a description of clause combinations is
carried out with an emphasis on the morphemes as well as the syntactic structures that
make relations between clauses possible.","[455, 456, 457]"

The basic inflectional categories in Mambay are marked by length and tone on subject
pronouns (6.1.2) and tone on verb words (see 7.3.2.2 as well this section below).
Mambay verb forms may be divided into Indicative (7.4.1) and Optative (7.4.2) moods.
The clear majority of verb forms are Indicative, and are further subdivided according to
realis value, aspect, and tense.8 Optative forms, in contrast, do not reflect these
distinctions. This basic verb system may be schematized as follows:                         Functions of basic verbal inflection in Mambay                    mood          realis value         aspect                 tense

                OptativeIndicative verb forms are used to express events (7.4.1). Optative verb forms, in contrast,
are used to express a speaker’s wishes, to express purpose in dependent clauses, and to
express the effect of causation (7.4.2). Formally, the classification of Indicative vs.
Optative mood corresponds to the use of the negation particles yá and gá (7.5.2)
respectively. In addition, Indicative verb forms are inflected for realis value, aspect, and
tense.","[355, 356]"

"7.4.1.2 Irrealis
Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not happening.
They have in common a CVV subject pronoun shape. Irrealis verb forms are represented
by the Future tense and negated Indicative verb forms. Although this higher-level
grouping could seem like an ad hoc device to account for a coincidental formal match,
Payne (1997:244–5) and Palmer (2001:168–75) state that both future and negative forms
frequently pattern as irrealis in languages that mark this distinction; Roberts (1990) gives
examples of this (see especially p. 378).",[367]

"More may be said regarding the articulation of the nasal click in Mambay, some of which
is likely pertinent to its realization in other languages. Visual and auditory observation
reveals that, similar to what happens with the production of labial-velar stops (2.1.7.2),
negative pressure in the oral air chamber is accomplished by the lowering of the jaw
and/or the tongue during velar and labial closure. However, rather than releasing the
negative balance of pressure at the lips, the back of the tongue is dropped. When the
tongue’s seal with the velum is broken, air rushes into a newly unified oropharyngeal
cavity from an open nasal/pharyngeal breathing tract. The resulting sound is a sharp
click with a high-pitched onset and a low, dull reverberation in the oropharyngeal cavity,                                            60
and the sound may be heard from the nose as well as through the cheeks. There is no
voicing at any time during the articulation.","[77, 78]"

To the north of the Adamawa Massif and approximately eight hundred kilometres from
the Gulf of Guinea, the Mambay ethnic group straddles the border of Cameroon and
Chad. Members of the group, numbering about fifteen thousand, live along the Mayo
Kebbi (Kebbi River) at the point where it flows south-west from Chad toward its
confluence with the Benue River in Cameroon.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"The direction of an accompanying pulmonic airstream is irrelevant to the
accomplishment of the articulation; in fact, breathing normally takes place through the
nose throughout the period of articulation. The negative balance of oral air pressure
described in the previous paragraph is compensated for by an increase of air rushing in
though the nose (during incidental inhalation) or an egressive pulmonic airstream (during
incidental exhalation).",[78]
"Most commonly, interrogative pronouns co-occur with the question particle nà
(10.1.2.1). If the interrogative pronoun is the subject of the clause, it comes in the usual
subject position (before the verbal complex; see 10.1.1) and the question particle comes
at the end of the clause.       víí  Ø      húmgò nà                   who comes? / who is coming?

If the interrogative pronoun and question particle are found alone in a clause, or if the
interrogative pronoun is found in clause-final position (e.g. as an object, adverbial
complement, or predicate nominal), the pronoun and question particle form a single

The Mambay verb system exhibits richness in the types of available verb structures as
well as the functional distinctions represented by combinations of these structures. These
possibilities are outlined in the following paragraphs.","[313, 314, 315, 316]"
"Adjectives are syntactically distinct from nouns, which are also used to express noun
attributes. It is true that in noun phrases, it is not possible to distinguish nouns and
adjectives syntactically (5.14.1, 5.14.2):       noun + adjective:       bàh     míz4míz                drizzly rain
                               rain:LF drizzly       noun + noun:            bàh     pâh                    wet rain
                               rain:LF wetnessHowever, the difference between adjectives and nouns may be deduced from attributive
predicate constructions: an adjective is juxtaposed with the noun it modifies (10.1.3.3),
but an attributive noun is always connected to the noun it modifies with the copula ká
(10.1.3.2):       adjective:              )à          míz4míz            it is drizzly
                               3IMPERS     drizzly       noun:                   )à          ká         pâh it is wet
                               3IMPERS     ATTRIB     wetness                                             391
The situation is comparable for adjectives and ideophonic adverbs (8.3). Although there
are many structural similarities between these two classes, there are differences in
syntactic distribution. As shown above and repeated in the following examples,
adjectives are found in the dependent position of a noun phrase or in an attributive
predicate.       dependent position:    bàh     míz4míz             drizzly rain
                              rain:LF drizzly       attributive predicate: )à            míz4míz       it is drizzly
                              3IMPERS       drizzlyAdverbs, on the other hand, modify a verb or an entire clause. They come after the verb
and can only be followed by a particle (10.1.1).","[408, 409]"

3.4.3.4 Verb stem to Perfect affix 4rì
When the Perfect affix 4rì is attached to a verb stem ending in a nasalized vowel or a
nasal consonant, the nasality of the verb stem spreads rightward onto it (7.3.1.3). In the
pairs of examples below, the first example shows the spread of nasality onto 4rì, and the
second example shows a similar context in which there is no spread of nasality.       mì      kúú                     4rì              mì kúúrì

       1&2     bend.down:PERF PL       PERF              we (incl.) have bent down3.4.3.5 Optative verb stem to appended vowel 4í
When there is no explicit object with an Optative and the verb is phrase-final, an
additional vowel 4í is appended after some consonants (7.4.2.1). If 4í follows a stem-final
nasal consonant, nasality spreads from the consonant onto it.       mú         kàn4í                      [you (sg.)] pass (something)!
       2SG:OPT    pass:OPT-V       mú         zòNm4í                     [you (sg.)] fix (something)!

       2SG:OPT    crunch:OPT-V       mú         sà 4í                      [you (sg.)] vomit (something)!

3.4.3.6 Negation particle yá
The particle yá is used in negation (10.1.2.3). In terms of nasality, it functions as a clitic:
whenever it follows any morpheme ending in a nasalized vowel or nasal consonant,
nasality spreads from that morpheme onto the clitic.       mìí         kúú                         =yá             mìí kúú=yá

       1SG:PFV.NEG eat:PFV goat                NEG             I did not eat the goat3.4.3.7 Extent and limitations of spread
Nasality spreads across morpheme boundaries only in the six contexts described above
(3.4.3.1–3.4.3.6). Even within phonological words, the spread of nasality is sensitive to
morphological boundaries (cf. 2.5.1, 4.1.2.2). For example, nasality does not spread
across prefix-noun or other noun-internal boundaries:       prefix-noun boundary (5.1.2.2):       ná4)áà                 bean leaves
       nà4rúvò                phlegm, moist object
       tí4náánì               dragonfly
       tí4kà4ràhgú            large heron sp.       boundary between a regular verbal noun and a dummy object (5.9.1.1):       làà             4na                 làánà
       eat:VN          -OBJ                eating (something)       gîr             4na                 gîrná
       insult:VN       -OBJ                insulting (something)       other noun-internal boundaries (5.4.2):       lè74lé74gérmù          kingfisher sp. (cf. gérmù ‘women’)
       tâw4nîn4gáhlà7         fish sp. (cf. tâw ‘(male proper name),’ nínù ‘eye,’ gáhlà7
                                ‘faceted’)
       tôr4nà4múùrá           maize (cf. tórà ‘seed,’ nà4múùrá ‘jinn’)
                                             114
Conversely, while nasality spreads across the boundary to the negation clitic yá from the
word that precedes it (3.4.3.6), tonal boundaries remain intact in this context. This is
evident in the following example:       múùrá=yá
       silt = NEG       (in: mùú kó múùrá=yá you did not see the silt)If there were no tonal boundary between the two morphemes, the sequence would
constitute a single tonal word múúràyá with a HLH melody, like other HLH words of
the same shape (4.1.2.2). However, this is not the case.","[129, 130, 131, 132]"
"Chapter 7 examines verbs. First, canonical morphologically simple stems are examined.
This is followed by a discussion of non-canonical stems, most of which are
morphologically complex; the most prominent group of non-canonical stems contain
verbal extensions. A description of verb word morphology then leads into a discussion of
verbal inflection, which is marked on the verb word, subject pronouns and by means of
expanded verb forms, including those which incorporate auxiliary verbs and TAM
adverbs and particles. A final section describes composite verbal expressions: these are
constructions composed of a verb stem recurrently found with another element (noun,
prepositional phrase, etc.) in the lexicon.",[44]
"10.1.2.1 The question particle nà
When the question particle nà is juxtaposed with a noun, an interrogative clause results.       kwéé nà                                    is it Kwe?
       Kwe QMThe particle nà may also be applied to complete verbless clauses (10.1.3.1).       mù kwéé nà                                 are you Kwe?

As is the case with the Perfect (7.4.1.1.1.2) and Pluperfect (7.4.1.1.1.3), third person
singular and plural forms (excluding co-referential forms) of the basic Perfective are
marked with a zero pronoun.       Ø     hèè                   he/she/it climbed

"7.6.3.2 Constructions with auxiliaries
A variety of complex inflectional constructions employ auxiliaries, that is, verbs which
are head of the verb phrase but which do not embody the main activity expressed by the
clause (Payne 1997:84). In addition, the examples below show that auxiliaries express a
meaning that is not fully compositional, that is, one which differs from the meaning
found when the same verb does embody a clause’s main activity.",[387]

2.1.7.2 Ingressive velaric
In Mambay, the labial-velar stops kp and gb are articulated with a combination of the
egressive pulmonic and ingressive velaric airstreams. Ladefoged (1968:9) catalogues this
type of articulation as one of three ways in which labial-velar stops may be produced, and
describes its articulatory and phonetic qualities in detail. In short, this airstream
mechanism is made by negative pressure in the oral cavity, accomplished by the lowering
of the jaw at the point when both velar and labial closure have been achieved. The
ingressive velaric quality of these stops in Mambay is confirmed by a “popping” sound
which is present upon their release, when air rushes into the oral cavity from both front
and back. This sound is more clearly heard with kp than it is with gb.","[76, 77]"
"10.1.3.1 Noun + particle
The simplest verbless clauses are those comprised of a (pro)noun and an Indicative
particle (10.1.2).       mù nà                          is it you?

Equivalence-type (A is B / A is a kind of B / A is identified by B) clauses are constructed

       house mudLocative clauses may be constructed in the same way, except that the second noun
necessarily refers to a place. This leads to structural ambiguity which may be resolved by
appealing to discourse-internal references as well as the text-external referential realm.       mì fíílò                       I am at the house (/I am the house)

       Kada KaakaalaWhen the predicate of a verbless clause is a noun which describes the quality of the
subject, the subject and the predicate noun are linked by the attributive copula ká.
Although this particle may have originated historically from a preposition (cf. Elders
2000:243), in Mambay it is not used synchronically in any other context.       )à          ká          bààgá             it is hard

In addition to being found with a noun + noun structure (10.1.3.2), locational clauses may
be constructed by juxtaposing a subject with a prepositional phrase headed by the
prepositions sáà ‘inside, in,’ má ‘with/and’ or bèè ‘without’ (9.3).","[454, 455]"
"The nasal click is a paralinguistic utterance used in Mambay as the default means of
communicating agreement or assent. It is typically repeated, especially when a speaker
wants to signal strong agreement. This articulation is used by speakers of many other
languages for an equivalent function; its areal distribution extends to much of northern
Cameroon, southern Chad and likely other adjacent regions. Sang-Yong Lee (pers.
comm. 2003) has suggested that the same clicking sound is also used in south-eastern
dialects of Korean, where it expresses sympathy and condolence. A similar phenomenon
is the “ingressive nasal accompaniment” which occurs with clicks in some Khoisan
languages (Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996:102). However, in that context, there is also
a release at the front of the mouth.",[77]
"7.6.1 TAM indicators
In addition to TAM (Tense/Aspect/Mode) marking in the basic verbal system (7.4), TAM
is marked by means of TAM particles (7.6.1.1) and adverbs (7.6.1.2). Particles form a
closed set and, since they bear a single mora, do not meet the minimal weight
requirements for adverbs (8.1, 8.3). TAM adverbs, on the other hand, are part of the open
class of adverbs (8.1).",[377]

The following aspects of clause structure are covered in this section: constituent order

"7.4.2.1 In main clauses
Optative verb forms are most commonly found in main clauses. In this context, a general

"These particles fall into three groups: Indicative particles, Optative particles, and an
attributive copula ká. While Indicative particles are treated in the present section,
Optative particles are described in the chapter on verbs (7.6.1.1.2), and the attributive
copula is described in the context of verbless clauses (10.1.3.2).",[450]
"Like prepositions, directional adverbs (8.1.1) are also used to express locative concepts.
However, they differ from prepositions in that they may not themselves take a
complement (cf. 9.3.1), and in that they are always found with a verb.       mú           tè’         vòró                         [you (sg.)] go there!
