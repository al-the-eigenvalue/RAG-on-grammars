"6.3.1 Directional (goal)
The morpheme ca may be a preposition. This morpheme occurs in (6.20-6.21) where
it is glossed as dir ((6.21) is repeated below for convenience). However, its status
is unclear. It may be a weakened form of locative ká, or it may be a fully-ﬂedged
preposition in its own right, formed from the verb acɔ ‘go’. A third analysis would be
that, at least in some instances, it has not undergone grammaticalization and remains
a form of the verb.(6.21) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́ cá lámáːcá      tá-mɔ́               kákka
        Kuku 3m.go.to dir grinding.hut non.core-3f.dem Kaka
        ‘Kuku is going to Kaka’s grinding room.’   Evidence that ca may be a form of ká comes from the fact that there seems to be an
alternation between the two forms. Although in (6.21) ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́ ‘go.to’ is followed by cá,
in (6.14) and (6.17) the same verb is followed by locative ká, with no obvious diﬀerence
in meaning. Stevenson (1941:74) also notes this alternation, stating that it is restricted
to certain verbs. An additional piece of evidence is the fact that during ﬁeldwork no
examples of ca with personal pronouns were found. This would be unexpected if ca
were a preposition. It would also be unexpected if ca were a verb that takes a direct
object, which appears to be the case in (6.18-6.19). So it may be that directional ca is
in fact a variant of locative ká which occurs in certain (as yet unspeciﬁed) contexts.
   Waag (2012:4) suggests that although ca is clearly related to the verb, it may have
grammaticalized in certain contexts and so includes c- in her table of case aﬃxes as
‘direction to’ (Waag 2012:6). In the draft Katcha New Testament, ca is commonly
glossed as ‘to’, rather than ‘go’, which may suggest some native speaker intuition in
this direction. In regard to its interaction with personal pronouns, Waag places ca
in the third group, those which take core 1st and 2nd person pronouns but oblique
3rd person pronouns. As just noted, I was unable to conﬁrm this. If Waag’s data
is accurate, this would clearly distinguish ca it from locative ká, which takes oblique
forms throughout.
   The third possibility is that ca is a variant of the verb acɔ ‘go’. This is the view taken
by Stevenson (1941:74). As evidence, he cites the negative imperative form, though the
argument is somewhat opaque, consisting of three example sentences and the statement,
‘the negative imperative indicates that no preposition is involved.’ (Stevenson 1941:74)
In the draft Katcha New Testament this morpheme, which is most frequently realised
110                            Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and Prepositionsphonetically as /ca/ is invariably spelled as ‘co’. This may suggest some native speaker
intuition that it is at least related to the verb. More signiﬁcantly, it is not unusual for
the (fully inﬂected) verb form acɔ to follow another verb of motion. Generally this is
ʊ́ŋkéːne.5 The combination ʊ́ŋkéːne acɔ occurs frequently, often expressing the notion
of leaving or setting out to go somewhere as in (6.45). It may be that ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́ acɔ is
also a licit combination of verbs, and that ca following the verb of motion in (6.21) is
in fact a form of the verb acɔ.(6.45) unggeene aaco                  a     naanya kuꞌbꞌba
         ʊŋkeːne       a-acɔ          a     na-anya kʊɓɓa
         3m.go.out 3m.pfv-go dat pl-town far.away
         ‘he set oﬀ for a distant country.’                                                 (LUK 15.13)    My tentative analysis is to take the third position and to treat ca as a verb form.
One of the additional pieces of evidence for this analysis comes from looking more
carefully at its complement. In (6.18-6.19), the verb acɔ seems to take a direct object.
However, in (6.45) it appears to be followed by the dative marker a. This is a pattern
that is repeated throughout the corpus of written Katcha. For example, in the Gospel
of Luke, there are 31 examples of acɔ followed directly by a (consonant-initial) nominal
object, but 6 examples of acɔ followed by dative a before the noun. The ‘preposition’
ca/cɔ shows a similar pattern. There are 33 examples in Luke of cɔ followed directly by
a (consonant-initial) nominal object, but 15 examples of cɔ followed by dative a before
the noun. There is no obvious pattern to the presence or absence of the dative a; I
leave aside the question of whether there is a pattern yet to be discovered, whether it
is genuinely optional or whether there is simply an orthographic inconsistency.6 The
relevant fact is that the ‘preposition’ ca/cɔ displays the same behaviour as the verb
acɔ.
    During ﬁeldwork, no examples of cɔ with personal pronouns were elicited; according
to the Katcha speakers I worked with, it is not possible for cɔ to be followed by a
personal pronoun. This contrasts with Waag’s (2012:6) description of c- as belonging
to the third type of preposition, which take core 1st and 2nd person pronouns but
oblique 3rd person pronouns. In the draft Katcha New Testament there are very few
examples of cɔ followed by a pronoun. The only attested examples are all with the 3rd
person masculine oblique pronoun ɪːnɪ (written with a lenghtened initial vowel). There
is insuﬃcient data to be conclusive, but one plausible speculation is that the reason
I was unable to elicit a cɔ+pronoun sequence when asking for it directly is that such
    5
      ʊ́ŋkéːne is a non-goal-directed verb of motion (‘go oﬀ, go out, wander’) and contrasts with ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́
which implies a goal or destination (‘go to’).
    6
      Given the fact that Katcha vowels so frequently undergo processes of harmony and/or ellision, it
is plausible that these examples contain an underlying a that has been ellided and that the translators
may have been inconsistent in whether or not they have included it in the transcription.
6.3. Related Morphemes                                                               111sequences do not exist, and that the correct analysis is in fact cɔ+a+pronoun. This
would be consistent with the form of the pronoun which occurs in the New Testament
and also with Waag’s data. If this speculation turns out to be correct, that cɔ is
followed by dative a, it would strongly suggest that the ‘morpheme’ commonly realised
as ca is underlyingly a cɔ+a sequence and that cɔ is in fact (a form of) the verb acɔ.
Of course, such an analysis does not preclude the possibility that cɔ+a is in the process
of undergoing grammaticalization into a preposition ca.","[128, 129, 130]"

1.2 Morphosyntactic Descriptions
The language description focuses on the nominal system. The ﬁrst half, chapters 4 and
5, focuses on the role of nominals as heads, considering phenomena such as classiﬁcation,
agreement and modiﬁcation. The second half, chapters 6 and 7, focuses on nominals as
dependents and arguments, considering phenomena such as prepositional phrases, case
and verbal valency.
    Chapter 4 describes nominal classiﬁcation in Katcha. Katcha has an interaction
between the categories of Number and Gender which is typologically unusual and is
also relevant to the wider debate about the genetic aﬃliation of the Kadu family.
The chapter begins with a discussion of number marking, presenting the variety of
singulative and plurative preﬁxes with which number is marked on Katcha nouns. It is
1.2. Morphosyntactic Descriptions                                                      5demonstrated that these show the typically Nilo-Saharan characteristic of occuring in
a tripartite distribution, where some nouns take plurative aﬃxes, some take singulative
aﬃxes and some take both. However, it is also demonstrated that among the third
group are nouns which show the typically Niger-Congo characteristic of occuring in
classes which have a semantic basis and are indicated morphologically by their number
aﬃxes. Following the discussion of number is a discussion of gender, which establishes
that agreement in Katcha is based on three gender classes, and not on two gender
classes plus plural number as has sometimes been suggested. Having described number
marking and gender classiﬁcation, the discussion moves on to the interaction between
these two categories. It is shown that for morphologically number-marked nouns the
aﬃx, rather than the noun root, assigns gender to the noun. This can result in ‘polarity’
where the gender of a noun in the singular may be diﬀerent from its gender in the
plural. Interestingly, polarity is most commonly found in Afro-Asiatic, meaning that
the number system shows some properties of all three North-East African language
phyla. Finally, this chapter argues that the semantic basis of the third gender class is
the notion of plurality and that Katcha is best described as having a three-class gender
system of Masculine, Feminine and Plural. Such systems have been argued to exist in
some Cushitic languages, but to my knowledge this is the ﬁrst time it has ever been
recorded outwith that language family.
   Chapter 5 presents a description and uniﬁed analysis of Katcha nominal modiﬁers, of
which there are three main types: demonstratives, possessors and relative clauses. It is
noted that in each case, nominal modiﬁers display gender agreement with the modiﬁed
noun, carry morphological marking when the modiﬁed noun is a peripheral argument
of the verb, and occur in ‘headless’ constructions where there is no overt noun to be
modiﬁed (in which case they have a pronominal interpretation). It is then argued that
nominal modiﬁers are all demonstrative pronouns, or phrases headed by demonstrative
pronouns, which are appositional to the modiﬁed noun. With the exception of the
medial and distal demonstratives, all modiﬁers are introduced by morphemes of a
similar form. Phonological evidence is presented that suggests that these occur in
complementary distribution and are therefore allomorphs. It is then argued that this
modifying morpheme is the proximal demonstrative pronoun, allowing the incorpo-
ration of the medial and distal demonstratives into the same system and explaining
why the latter have a diﬀerent form, but identical distribution to all other nominal
modiﬁers. This chapter ﬁnishes with some cross-linguistic perspective by discussing
the relationship between the analysis of Katcha outlined here and two notions which
have been argued to be appropriate to a number of African languages: the ‘relative
marker’ and the ‘construct state’. It is suggested that both of these typically African
constructions may result from grammaticalization of the demonstrative pronoun which
heads the nominal modiﬁer.
6                                                           Preliminaries: Introduction    Chapter 6 describes personal pronouns in Katcha and aims to explain the diﬀerences
between the various forms. There are two basic sets of pronominal forms: ‘core’
pronouns and ‘oblique’ pronouns. The choice of pronominal form is dependent on
its role in the sentence and, in oblique cases, the preposition it follows. A description
of prepositions and similar morphemes, including the pronominal forms they select,
is therefore also presented in section 6.3 along with other aspects of the prepositional
system, such as the modiﬁcation of prepositional phrases by adverbs or by further
prepositional phrases and the lexical selection of prepositions by certain verbs. The
chapter concludes by returning to the discussion of pronominal forms, where it is
suggested that these diﬀerent forms may be best described as realisations of case.
Taking into account evidence from tone alternations and typological universals, it is
tentatively concluded that Katcha personal pronouns occur in one of three three cases:
Nominative, Accusative and Oblique.
    Chapter 7 describes the derivational verbal suﬃxes known as ‘verb extensions’
(VEs), whose function is to increase or decrease semantic valency, licensing or prohibit-
ing the presence of nominals as arguments within the proposition. The vast majority
of VEs in Katcha are detransitivising, their function being to license the absence of
otherwise mandatory core arguments. A descriptive analysis is given classifying them
according to the number and type of their argument roles. In addition to the valency
reducing VEs, Katcha has one morpheme which appears to be valency increasing,
namely the applicative, though it is noted that in several ways the Katcha ‘applicative’
is rather atypical. Finally, reciprocal and reﬂexive forms are discussed. These are
functionally similar to the valency decreasing verb extensions of section 7.2, but it is
suggested that they may in fact be pronominal constructions.","[23, 24, 25]"

3.4 Tone
The majority of research that has been done on Kadu languages, even phonological
research, has ignored the issue of tone. ‘All Kadu languages are almost certainly
tone languages… but the data are insuﬃcient to analyse the various tonal systems’
(Schadeberg 1994:18). The only published paper with any attempt to analyse tonal
behaviour is Hall (2006) for Kamda.
   It seems likely that there are two underlying level tones in Katcha. Hall (2006:178-
179) states that Mid tone exists phonetically in Kamda, but has some discussion on it
and notes some evidence for it being an allotone of High (it only occurs word ﬁnally,
for example), though its status remains unclear. Schadeberg (1994:18) ‘more or less
uncritically assumed a two tone system’ with occasional downstep. He also notes that
‘Falling tones are rare, and rising tones even more so’ (Schadeberg 1994:18). Both
30                                                             Preliminaries: PhonologySchadeberg (1994) and Hall and Hall (2004) cite Reh (1985) as describing Krongo as
having a two-tone system, and though Schadeberg cites Matsushita (1984) as ﬁnding
a three-tone system in Kadugli, he points out that Matushita’s Mid tone is rarer than
High or Low. In my observation, there are few if any examples of three-way tone
contrasts.
     There are few lexical items which distinguished solely by tone, though there are
some functional words where this is the case. For example, the locative preposition ká
has high tone, while the dependent clause marker ka has low tone.
     The main use of tone seems to be grammatical. This seems to be true for Kadu as a
whole: ‘[The] most frequent use of tone and/or stress to distinguish between otherwise
similar words is grammatical, diﬀerentiating between diﬀerent forms of the verb’ (Hall
and Hall 2004:7). In chapter 6 the possibility is discussed that tone distinctions are used
to mark case in Katcha, at least on pronouns. Tone is also used to distinguish between
certain verb aspects (parallel versus antecedent events), though these fall outwith the
scope of the current study.
     Hall and Hall (2004) also suggest a possible connection between tone and stress:
‘It has also been noted that heightened tone and loudness have a strong tendency to
co-occur’ (Hall and Hall 2004:7). This is true for Katcha, certainly on a phrasal level.
It is my impression that there is usually one syllable per ‘intonational domain’ which
carries a higher tone and is louder than all others. This syllable appears to be the most
stressed or focussed within the phrase. I leave open the question of what constitutes an
‘intonational domain’ and what role the focussed syllable has within it, but in chapter
5 it is noted that this kind of phenomenon seems to be intonational, associated with a
pause or with contrast.
     Hall (2006:179) observes for Kamda that a ‘signiﬁcant amount of pitch conditioning
is evident.’ He lists a number of Kamda constructions in which the tones of the noun
are changed by the presence of a particular particle or aﬃx. This is also something
that occurs in Katcha. Some conditioning is easy to account for, such as the fact
that the normally low tone on the ﬁrst syllable of an oblique pronoun becomes high
following the high tone locative preposition (section 6.2.2). Other conditioning is much
more complex, so I have attempted to mark the surface form of tone as accurately as
possible throughout this study. As noted above though, vowels are frequently elided in
Katcha; in these cases I have marked the underlying tone (and indeed, the underlying
vowel) where it is known.
3.5. Orthographic conventions used in this study                                       313.5 Orthographic conventions used in this study
In general, I have tried to adopt a conservative but morphophonemic transcription,
making as few analytical decisions as possible while still maintaining morphophonemic
transparency.
   Novel data in this study is transcribed using the IPA symbols in (3.1-3.2), with the
exception of the dental plosive phoneme, which is transcribed as <t>, and the front
mid-height vowel phoneme, which is transcribed as <e>.
   High tone is marked with an acute accent <á> and falling tone with a circumﬂex
<â>. Low tone is unmarked. As noted in section 3.4, I have attempted to mark
the surface form of tone wherever possible throughout this study. As noted above
though, vowels are frequently elided in Katcha; in these cases I have transcribed the
underlying tone (and indeed, the underlying vowel) where it is known. Note that where
examples are taken from written sources they are transcribed without tone (the source
is acknowledged in all such cases).
   ‘Long’ plosives and implosives are unambiguously geminates and so are transcribed
with a double consonant <kk>. Long nasals, glides and vowels are more ambiguous as
to their status and so are marked as long <aː> unless they can be clearly analysed as
belonging to two separate morphemes, in which case a morpheme boundary is marked
<a-a>.
   All Katcha and IPA data is set using haris         font. When phonemic, phonetic or
orthographic forms speciﬁcally are being refered to in the text, the appropriate brackets
are used and the text is upright. In other cases, quoted linguistic forms are written in
italic without brackets.
    Unless speciﬁcally illustrating phonetic processes such as ﬁnal vowel elision, the
full citation form of morphemes is given in interlinear examples. For example, the
instrumental preposition ana is usually realised as [a] before a consonant and [an] before
a vowel, but is transcribed as <ana> (with relevant tones) in interlinear morphemic
glossing.
    Where data examples are taken from written sources, the original orthography is
given verbatim and then transliterated to match the above orthographic conventions
(without adding tones). In the case of data quoted from Stevenson (1941, 1956-57),
he standardly gives a free (though relatively literal) English translation, but does
not give morpheme breaks or glosses. When quoting his data, I therefore quote the
example verbatim, give my own interlinear morphemic gloss, and give Stevenson’s free
translation. Thus in examples such as (3.3), the ﬁrst and ﬁnal lines are Stevenson’s,
while the intervening lines are mine. Likewise, with examples taken from the draft
Katcha New Testament, the text is ﬁrst given verbatim, then my morphemic gloss, then
32                                                                   Preliminaries: Phonologyan English free translation from one of the English source texts.1 Thus in examples
such as (3.4), the ﬁrst and ﬁnal lines are taken from the Katcha and English Bible
translations respectively while the intervening lines are mine.(3.3) bibala iyana                  fɔ

Chapter 4Number and GenderIntroduction
Katcha has an interaction between the categories of Number and Gender which is typo-
logically unusual. It is also relevant to the wider debate about the genetic aﬃliation of
the Kadu family because the number and gender systems display properties reminiscent
of both Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan languages. The interaction between number
and gender also shows properties which are very rare, but which have been argued
to exist in certain Afro-Asiatic languages. This is something of a surprise; with the
partial exception of Blench (2006), no previous research has suggested a relationship
between Kadu and the Afro-Asiatic phylum. Whilst typological similarities alone do
not constitute deﬁnitive proof that a language belongs to a particular phylum, they
certainly should be considered seriously. The existence of shared typological phenomena
in two languages may be evidence of a diachronic connection (Bickel 2007, 2011). In
any case, it is notable that the phenomena described in this chapter reﬂect the general
state of confusion over the lineage of Katcha. Given the complexity of the data, it is
not surprising that diﬀerent researchers have interpreted them diﬀerently. There is a
general correlation between the way the morphosyntactic facts have been interpreted
and the assumptions about the language’s genetic aﬃliation prevalent at the time.
Thus, following Greenberg’s (1950) classiﬁcation of the Kadu languages as Kordofanian,
older studies of Katcha (Stevenson 1956-57; Tucker and Bryan 1966) attempted to
demonstrate Niger-Congo-style semantically based noun classes based on the number
preﬁxes. Following Schadeberg’s (1981) questioning of this assumption, more recent
work (Dimmendaal 2000; Gilley 2013) has sought to demonstrate that Katcha displays
a tripartite system more typical of Nilo-Saharan. This chapter will demonstrate that
there are elements of both of these systems present in the Katcha number system,
before going on to demonstrate that certain features of the gender system, such as the
notion of ‘polarity’ and its interaction with number, are more similar to those found in
                                           35
36                                     Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Number and GenderAfro-Asiatic.
       The chapter begins with a discussion of number marking in section 4.1. Number
is marked on Katcha nouns by a variety of plurative and singulative aﬃxes. A very
welcome recent development in this area has been the publication of Leoma Gilley’s
paper on noun morphology in Katcha (Gilley 2013). This is a comprehensive and
systematic presentation of data on Katcha nouns, focusing on the number-marking
aﬃxes.      Gilley’s data, which was collected from Katcha speakers in Khartoum in
2006–2007, matches my own quite closely. In section 4.1 below, I therefore present
some representative nouns of each type and mention where my data diverges from
Gilley’s, but for further examples the interested reader may refer to Gilley’s paper.
       The gender system is then described in section 4.2. The main focus of this section is
to establish the number of gender classes in Katcha; there are three classes of agreement
in Katcha but previous work has been inconsistent as to whether these represent three
gender values, or only two genders plus plural number agreement. The argument
is made that there are three values of gender. It is demonstrated that these are
semantically based on biological gender and so they are described – temporarily –
as masculine, feminine and neuter.
       Having described number marking and gender classiﬁcation, the discussion moves
on to the interaction between these two categories. There are two senses in which
number and gender interact in Katcha. Firstly, there is a relationship between the
number-marking preﬁx and the gender of the noun. This is discussed in section 4.3
where it is shown that (for morphologically number-marked nouns) the aﬃx, rather
than the noun root, assigns gender to the noun. This can result in ‘gender polarity’
where the gender of the noun changes when its number changes. Secondly, there is an
intimate connection between the third gender class and the concept of plurality. This
is discussed in section 4.4. It is argued that rather than neuter, the semantic basis of
the third gender category might be better described as plural.1 The incorporation of
plural as a value of the gender system is a phenomenon that has been described (and
argued about) in the literature on Cushitic, but has to my knowledge never before been
recorded outwith that language family.
       The place of this chapter within the study as a whole is largely to provide back-
ground information. The focus in this chapter is primarily morphological: to establish
the number and nature of gender classes. An understanding of the gender system,
and to a lesser extent the number system, is foundational to understanding Katcha
nominals. However, it is not the main focus of the descriptive and theoretical analyses
in the rest of the thesis, which focus on syntax and semantics. I assume that phonology
and morphology play a part in establishing the input to syntax, but I am relaxed about
   1
     Sets may also be thought of as neuter, at least in terms of natural gender distinctions, but plurality
is the more important feature in Katcha.
4.1. Number                                                                                          37exactly how this is done. Where there is no evidence to the contrary, my default is to
assume a transparent analytic morphology for multimorphemic words on the basis that
this best satisﬁes Occam’s razor.2 For this reason the descriptive analyses in part II
largely focus on establishing the function of individual morphemes and the theoretical
analyses in part III on deﬁning their formal semantics. I assume that evidence in
favour of taking an alternative, more lexical position in any particular case will largely
come from morphophonology (Kaye 1989, 1995). Since this study has little to say
on phonology, I remain open minded about the best morphological analysis in any
given instance and in places I consider analyses based on an alternative morphological
characterisation.3,4
4.1 Number
Number is marked on Katcha nouns by plurative and singulative aﬃxes. Most of
these are preﬁxes, and they are relatively numerous. In some cases, singulative and
plurative preﬁxes occur in pairs, and in a subset of these, it is possible to see a semantic
connection between the nouns they inﬂect. In this way, Katcha nouns superﬁcially
resemble Kordofanian nouns with their noun-class preﬁxes and Stevenson (1941, 1956-
57) frames his presentation of nouns in these terms. Stevenson does note two important
caveats: ﬁrstly, that the agreement system in Katcha is quite diﬀerent to those found
in the Kordofanian languages (this is discussed in section 4.2), and secondly, that ‘most
of the noun classes possess either a singular or a plural preﬁx, but not both’ (Stevenson
1941:26).
       More recent work (Dimmendaal 2000; Gilley 2013) has argued that Katcha displays
a system more typical of Nilo-Saharan nouns: a tripartite system consisting of ‘singu-
lative marking, plural marking, and a replacement pattern’ (Dimmendaal 2000:214).
That is to say, there are nouns whose plural form is unmarked and whose singular is
marked morphologically; there are nouns where the unmarked form is the singular and
it is the plural form which is morphologically marked; ﬁnally, there are nouns where
both singular and plural carry morphological inﬂection. Diverging from Dimmendaal’s
terminology slightly, I refer to morphology of the ﬁrst type as singulative, to the second
type as plurative and to the third type as replacive. To avoid ambiguity, when referring
to the number of the referent, I use the terms semantically singular or semantically
plural.
   2
      We need a syntax to combine linguistic units anyway, so all things being equal we may as well use
it rather than have a separate set of morphological operations.
    3
      For example, see the discussion in section 9.5 of whether verbs carrying an applicative suﬃx should
be analysed as lexical items or analytically.
    4
      The approach to morphology summarized here is in line with the general assumptions of Dynamic
Syntax. DS takes linguistic formatives as projecting semantic instructions to the computation, but is
not exercised about whether those formatives are words or morphemes.
38                                  Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Number and Gender     Gilley’s (2013) choice of presentation method is particularly interesting with regard
to the Niger-Congo/Nilo-Saharan debate. She follows Dimmendaal (2000) in arguing
quite strongly that Katcha does indeed follow a Nilo-Saharan-style tripartite num-
ber marking system, but at the same time groups nouns into classes according to
their singulative/plurative-aﬃx pairs (allowing for one member of the pair to be zero-
marked). She therefore follows Stevenson in suggesting that there is a ∅-/nV- class, a
∅-/kV- class, a t-/∅- class, etc.
     In this section, the organization of the data focuses on the individual aﬃxes rather
than on any patterns that can be drawn from their pairings. This is because, as will be
seen below, there is a fair amount of ‘mix-and-matching’ when it comes to the replacive
nouns (those inﬂecting with both a singulative and a plurative preﬁx). Also, it will be
shown in section 4.3 that it is the individual aﬃxes which are relevant to agreement
in Katcha, and not the aﬃx-pair ‘classes’. The plurative aﬃxes are introduced ﬁrst,
followed by the singulative aﬃxes and then the replacive aﬃxes.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]"

decoration of the internal T y(e) node with a nominal variable.                In the case of a
relative clause, this allows any verb to construct and decorate the restrictor node freely.
However, the value of the logical subject is already ﬁxed, it is necessarily identiﬁed with
the head noun. Thus a verb can only decorate the restrictor node directly when its
subject is identiﬁed with the modiﬁed noun; only subjects can be relativised directly.
In this, Katcha obeys the generalisations of Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) Accessibility
Hierarchy, which states that subjects are more easily accessible to relativisation than
other NP positions, that positions on the hierarchy lower than subject may require to
be relativised using constructions other than the language’s ‘primary Relative Clause-
forming strategy’, and that the alternative strategies are more likely to include the
use of resumptive pronouns. Interestingly, while Keenan and Comrie (1977) suggest a

predicts (at least some aspects of) this observation from a formal, syntactic perspective.
   As noted above, the ﬁnal analysis of non-subject relatives is likely to rest on the
analysis of the dependent clause marker, ka. Furthermore, any such analysis will
have to take into consideration the fact that the verb of the relative clause cannot
decorate the predicate/restrictor node directly. One possible approach is hinted at
by the connection between relative clauses and possessive noun phrases, mentioned in
section 10.3. It was noted there that possessives may be considered a type of relative,
but the inverse may also be considered to be true. Indeed, the morphological similarity
between the Katcha possessive construction and the non-subject relative construction
is quite noticable, to the extent that Stevenson (1956-57:64) states that for the non-
subject relative, ‘a genitive construction (with genitive particle or possessive pronoun)
is used’. It was suggested in chapter 5 that given the non-ﬁnite nature of non-subject
relatives, and given their appositional nature, an appropriate paraphrase of the noun
phrase in sentences such as (10.29) is to use constructions along the lines of ‘the hen
of Kuku’s seeing her.’ This is a reasonable position to adopt reﬂecting as it does the
morphological link between the ‘possessive particle’ and the ‘relativiser’, as well as
reﬂecting the non-ﬁnite nature of the verb.
   One possible strategy for the analysis of non-subject relatives, then, might be to
see the non-ﬁnite clause as a nominalisation. The entire clause would then provide an
argument for the predicate represented in section 10.3 as P OSSD. If the predicate is
merely a ‘relation whose value is constructed from some contextually provided value’
(Kempson et al. 2001:145), it may be too restrictive to think of it as possession. In that
case, there is no reason why the relation should not hold between the referent of the
head noun and some more abstract entity, such as an event of seeing. Such an approach
would lead to a ﬁnal epsilon-structure along the lines of that sketched in (10.31), where
the internal structure of ϵx , Hen′ (x) is suppressed, SEEING′ is shorthand for some event
of Kuku seeing some object, and P OSSD is the relation that holds between this event
and x.

would entail parsing the head noun, constructing a LINK from it to a ?T y(e) node

to be parsed is the proper noun Kuku the possessive set of lexical actions (the second
disjunct from the lexical entry in (10.26)) will be executed, constructing the ‘possessive’
predicate as well as the iota-structure as its object. Thus far the process is exactly as
for possessives, leading to the partial tree in (10.32).","[265, 266, 267]"
"11.3.3 Grammar and lexicon
Dynamic Syntax deﬁnes two types of syntactic rules: computational actions and lexical
actions. The balance between them is explicitly lexicalist. That is, computational
actions are limited in number, general, optional and are universally available across lan-
guages, while language-speciﬁc idiosyncracies are associated with the actions of speciﬁc
lexical items. In section 9.2 it was noted that bare relatives in English pose something
of a challenge to DS because there is no overt morpheme to trigger the transition to a
relative clause. The choice of analysis is therefore between positing a phonologically null
lexical item (as per Cann et al. (2005:114)) or a language-idiosyncratic computational
rule (as per Kempson et al. (2001:117)), neither of which sit well with the principles
of Dynamic Syntax. This choice raises the question of how to evaluate the cost of an
extra computational rule: how willing should we be to posit new computational rules
(and is it worse than positing a silent grammatical marker)?
   One way towards answering this question might be to consider the likelihood of
ﬁnding constructions which might require new computational rules to account for them.
If the lexicalist model of grammar is correct, there should be a limited number of
computational actions and most of them should be relevant in most languages. Given
enough cross-linguistic data, it should be possible in theory to develop an exhaustive
list. At the same time, if computational actions are genuinely optional, the possibility
must be left open that there may be some rules which are used only rarely.               A
computational action that is motivated by data from only one language might be
suspicious, but it is not clear how many languages would need to be analysed as using
a particular action before it was no longer classed as ‘idiosyncratic’. Besides, it must be
theoretically possible that a rule that is dismissed for being language-idiosyncratic may
be a genuine rule of the computational system, just one that is not widely used. For
this reason I would favour positing a novel computational action over invoking a silent
morpheme, though it should always be done tentatively in the hope of conﬁrmation by
additional data. In fact, the LINK-COPY Introduction rule discussed in section
9.2 is an example of exactly this kind. It was introduced to account for English bare
relatives and was controversial due to seemingly being language-speciﬁc. However, the
fact that it has been used to account for Katcha recursive prepositional phrases – an
unrelated construction in an unrelated language – makes it seem much more likely to
be a universally available rule of grammar.
   Ultimately, answering these questions will need more analysis of more data from
diverse languages. Only with enough cross-linguistic data would it be possible to
11.3. Concluding comments                                                           261develop (something close to) an exhaustive list of computational actions, or to know
whether a given putative action is too idiosyncratic to be kept as a computational rule.
As ever in linguistics, there is a need for more ﬁeldwork, more language data and more
testing of the theory using data from many and diverse languages.
   Of course, we do not want to be positing novel computational actions too frequently.
If every language that is investigated turns up three or four extra rules, something
has gone wrong! However, it should be noted that in general the analyses of Katcha
nominals presented in this study have not required new computational actions to be
invoked. The analysis of recursive PPs required the resurrection of LINK-COPY
Introduction and the analysis of relative clauses as headed by demonstrative pro-
nouns required some adjustment to the concept of Substitution, but otherwise, the
analyses in part III were achieved by the application of pre-existing rules to new data.
It is important to note that the way these pre-existing rules apply in Katcha is often
diﬀerent to the way they apply in previously-studied languages. So LINK Apposition,
which has been used for appositive constructions and for equative copular clauses in
English, is used for nominal modiﬁers in Katcha. Likewise, LINK Introduction
rules used for relative clauses in English can be used for prepositional phrases and
applicatives in Katcha. This use of a small number of universal tools to create some
quite diﬀerent linguistic constructions is reﬂective of the variety and creativity found
in human language.

5.2 Possessive Noun Phrases
In possessive constructions the possessor, as the modiﬁer, follows the head noun (the
possessee). They are linked by a ‘possessive particle’ já/má/ná. Phonologically, this
morpheme may be more closely linked to the modiﬁer, but syntactically its connection
is with the head, as this is the noun with which it shows gender agreement (5.10).
As such, it does not seem accurate to describe this as a marker on the possessor noun
(which would make it essentially a genitive case marker, in the style of Indo-European).
Nor would it be accurate to describe it as a marker on the head noun (which might be
called a construct marker, in the style of Semitic - though see section 5.5.2 for further
discussion of this idea). Rather, it is a possessive linking particle which cliticises to the
following noun.

              ‘Kuku’s spear’When the possessor noun begins with a vowel, the vowel of the possessive marker
assimilates to the vowel of the possessor and the possessive marker cliticises to the
possessor noun. This can be most easily seen with pronouns such as eté in (5.11-5.13).(5.11) a a n-asáːsá         ɗi         j -́ t́ ́

        ‘I live in my father’s house with my mother’Stevenson (1941:48, 1956-57:62) treats pronominal possessors as possessive pronouns
which take a gender agreement preﬁx. That is, he treats jéːté in (5.11) as a possessive
pronoun éːté with a masculine agreement preﬁx j-, rather than as a possessive morpheme
já with a pronoun été, as glossed in (5.11). However, there are reasons to disprefer
Stevenson’s analysis. One is that this form of the pronoun (but without the gender
agreement) is used in many non-possessive contexts, such as dative and locative (see
chapter 6). Also, with respect to the t- preﬁx and to gender agreement, the possessor
phrases in (5.11-5.13) behave in an exactly parallel way to the possessive particle +
noun sequences in (5.10-5.15). These two facts suggest that the ‘possessive pronouns’

in the ordinary oblique case.2
      Further evidence that possessive pronouns are in fact possessive particle + pro-
noun sequences may come from the fact that in much of the existing Katcha written
material (eg. the draft Bible translation) they are written as separate words when
t- (marking a peripheral argument) is present, eg. <tiya t >. This is despite the
fact that possessive pronouns are written as single words when they modify a core
argument, eg. <y t >. The latter is reﬂective of the pronunciation, which is identical
in both cases, with the exception of some minor tone perturbation: tɪ ́jú:dú cf ju:dú .
It would seem probable that the single-word spelling is reﬂective of the phonology
while the two-word spelling is reﬂective of the underlying morphology. Where native
speakers naturally put their word breaks should certainly not be considered conclusive
linguistic evidence, but the existence of the two-word spelling, which does not match
the surface phonetics, does lend some additional weight to the argument that there is
a psychologically real morpheme break here.","[88, 89, 90]"

                   ♢       The contexts illustrated in (9.43b) and (9.43c) can be brought together under the
single notion that dative nouns decorate a term node which is neither the logical
subject nor the logical object of the proposition.                 In other words the dative case
simply marks nouns which are neither the subject nor the object of their clause. In
terms of modal tree logic, the logical subject node may be deﬁned as ⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)
and the logical object node may be deﬁned as ⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t). The lexical actions
of the a case marker therefore involve decorating the node under development with
requirements that neither of these two descriptions hold at that node. However, this
characterisation precludes (9.43a), where the dative noun decorates the open ?T y(e)
node in an applicative construction. To incorporate this possibility, dative a requires
a disjoint lexical entry with a disjunct making reference to the fact that an applicative
has been parsed (9.44).10(9.44) Lexical entry for dative a

                ELSE       Abort       When the pointer is on an open term node, the actions in (9.44) check whether
it is an applied argument (that is, whether the current node is an argument of the
ben ′ predicate projected by the applicative morpheme). If so, no action need be taken
and parsing may proceed. To allow this formally a ‘dummy action’ is carried out
duplicating the type requirement which already decorates the node and thus adding no
further information to the tree. If the node under development is not the argument
of such a predicate, the actions decorate the node with modal requirements expressing
the fact that the current node cannot be either the logical subject (?¬⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)) or
the logical object (?¬⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)).
       The lexical entry in (9.44) illustrates two diﬀerent ways in which context dependence
may be formalised. The actions of the second disjunct reﬂect the usual DS construal
of case, deﬁning the context in which the formula value of the node must ultimately
be interpreted (in this case the fact that it cannot be subject or object). These actions
  10
     This is not an issue if applicative verbs are in fact lexicalised. In that case the structure in (9.43b)
is the relevant one for applicative verbs as well as ditransitive verbs, and the lexical entry (9.44) does
not need the disjunction.
9.6. Case markers                                                                                   215constrain the further development of the tree and therefore decorate the node with
requirements. The strong negation operator (¬) is persistent (Kempson et al. 2001:289-
290): the statements it scopes over (⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t) and ⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)) hold for the
current partial tree but also for all subsequent tree developments. Thus the use of
requirements ensures that these conditions will be met at all subsequent stages of the
parse, most importantly at the ﬁnal evaluation of the tree.11
       Contrastingly, the ﬁrst disjunct does not place any restrictions on future tree growth,
it depends only on the presence of a particular morpheme (the applicative) in the
immediately preceding context. It is therefore modelled as a condition within the lexical
entry, allowing the parse to proceed only if the applicative morpheme has already been
parsed. This action of checking the Formula value of the the predicate may seem
stipulative, but this is simply a way of formalising lexical selection. The traditional
way of describing lexical selection would be to say that an applicative verb selects a
dative complement, but it is equally feasible to express the inverse - a dative noun
is licensed by the presence of an applicative verb - and this is what the lexical entry
expresses.12
       A similar process of lexical selection takes place when personal pronouns occur as
the complement of prepositions. As noted in chapter 6 there are two sets of personal
pronouns, which may be described as ‘Core’ and ‘Oblique’. When used as a prepositional
complement, the form of the pronoun is determined by the preposition. This selection
is strongly lexical: many prepositions do not select only one type of pronoun, but ‘mix
and match’ from the two sets. This makes it hard to deﬁne any pronominal feature
which the lexical entry might subcategorize for. The best way to model this lexical
stipulation is therefore to encode it within the lexical entry of the pronoun. This will
mean the lexical entry for the pronoun has to be multiply disjunctive, but since there
are a limited number of prepositions the disjunction will not be implausibly large.
For example, (9.45) gives a possible lexical entry for the 3rd person masculine oblique
personal pronoun ɪnɪ ́:(9.45) Lexical entry for ɪnɪ ́
  11
     Though in fact, in the case of (9.43b-c) the node has a ﬁxed address and so the requirements are
satisﬁed immediately.
  12
     In section 6.5 it was stated that most verbs do not select the forms of their arguments and this was
given as a reason for thinking of oblique role markers as prepositions rather than case markers. Here
we see an exception in that applicative verbs do select the form of their complement. This is further
support for the argument (which came initially from the theoretical analysis) that a should be thought
of as a dative case marker rather than a preposition.

      The distinction between active and antipassive, and between passive and unac-
cusative/middle voice, is an important one. Katcha is pro-drop, so any semantic
argument may be phonologically unrealised. However, the active (unmarked) form
and the passive form of the verb each take two semantic arguments. Note that while
passive may be deﬁned as reducing the verb’s syntactic valency by demoting the agent to
the status of a (usually implied) oblique argument, the semantic valency is unchanged:
there exists both an agent and a patient, even if the agent is only there by implication.
This contrasts with the other forms, the antipassive, unaccusative and middle voice,
each of which take only one semantic argument.
      Valency reduction is something of a challenge for standard formal semantics.1 A

150                                             Theoretical Analyses: Verb Extensionstransitive verb expresses a relation, which by deﬁnition requires two arguments, raising
the question of how a proposition with a ‘missing’ argument should be modelled. One
approach is to allow the ‘missing’ argument role to be taken by some object of minimal
semantic content, an object whose reference is both arbitrary and entirely context-
dependent. Thus the agent of some unaccusative verb V in a given situation s is simply
‘the V er in s’. An unaccusative sentence like ‘Drums are beaten’ can be thought of
informally as meaning ‘Drums are beaten (by the agent of drum-beating)’ or ‘Drums are
beaten (by whatever it is that beats drums)’. This contrasts with passive verbs, which
have two semantic arguments, even if the agent happens to be phonologically unrealised.
A passive sentence like ‘Drums are being beaten’ can thought of informally as ‘Drums
are being beaten (by him/her/it)’ or ‘Drums are being beaten (by someone/something)’.
    This chapter presents a Dynamic Syntax analysis of such constructions. Section
8.1 introduces the DS formalism and illustrates its use in a straightforward Katcha
sentence with an active, transitive verb. Section 8.2 introduces the concept of epsilon
terms. Dynamic Syntax construes all terms as terms of the epsilon calculus, and this
provides a straightforward way to model the kind of term described in the previous
paragraph . An epsilon term picks out an arbitrary witness of some predicate and this
predicate can be easily deﬁned as being dependent on the immediate context. Thus
the epsilon calculus allows us to deﬁne, with relative ease, structures such as ‘Kuku is
laughing (at some arbitrary object of Kuku’s laughter)’ or ‘Drums are beaten (by some
arbitrary agent of drum beating)’ and section 8.2 presents an analysis of antipassive
verbs in Katcha in these terms. It is argued that the lexical actions associated with the
antipassive suﬃx build a context-dependent epsilon structure at the logical object node.
Section 8.3 discusses passives, the implementation of which is very straightforward: it
is simply a case of moving the pointer to ensure that the sentential subject decorates
the logical object node. This analysis highlights the fact that the passive has a more
referential interpretation for the agent, in contrast with the arbitrary interpretations
of the ‘missing’ arguments of the antipassive, unaccusative and middle voice. Section
8.4 discusses unaccusative, the analysis of which is straightforward, following directly
from the discussion in the previous two sections. Section 8.5 is slightly more speculative,
considering what the analysis of middle voice might look like if it were to be treated as a
sequence of unaccusative, followed by antipassive. Somewhat remarkably, under such an
analysis, middle voice turns out to be truth conditionally equivalent to unaccusative but
to carry extra information which might be interpreted as adding intensity, as suggested
by Stevenson (cf section 7.2.5).view of predicate-argument relations.
8.1. Transitive verbs                                                                  1518.1 Transitive verbs
Dynamic Syntax (DS) (Kempson et al. 2001; Cann et al. 2005) is a representationalist,
monostratal, parsing-based theory of syntax. It is representationalist in that it purports
to represent the semantic content of natural language as structured formulae of a logical
language. It is monostratal in that there is no level of syntactic representation; there
are no syntactic ‘objects’. Rather, syntax is construed as the set of procedures which
determine how such semantic representations are built up. And it is parsing-based in
that these procedures are carried out incrementally as a string is parsed in real time.
This is the sense in which DS is dynamic. As each word or morpheme is parsed it
provides instructions for a transition from one partial semantic structure to another
until a complete logical form is reached.
   A completed semantic structure of Dynamic Syntax is a binary tree with nodes
which are decorated with terms of the epsilon calculus and which may be combined
according to the principles of the lambda calculus. Such a tree is built up step-by-step
using a limited number of general principles (computational actions), and instructions
provided by lexical material (lexical actions).
   The parse of a simple transitive sentence such as (8.1) begins, like all parses, with the
goal of establishing a proposition. This is represented in (8.2) by the expression ?T y(t)
which decorates the root node of a partial semantic tree, the question mark expressing
a requirement for that node to be decorated by something of semantic type t. T y is a
label for the category Type, whose values may be t (proposition), e (individual), e → t
(predicate), etc. A pointer, represented by ♢, marks the node of the partial semantic
structure currently under development. At this stage this is the only node in the tree.(8.1) kʊ́kkʊ́ abʊ       ambá

(8.2) Initial parse state
                                        ?T y(t), ♢
   Computational actions in Dynamic Syntax are both conditional, in the sense that
they require certain structural conditions to be met before they may apply, and optional.
One rule which may apply at this point is *Adjunction. This rule allows for the
construction of an argument node (i.e. requiring type e) whose ﬁnal position in the tree
is unknown at the time of construction. That is, it is not known which argument of the
proposition this node will ultimately represent. The underspeciﬁed relation between
the root node and the unﬁxed argument is represented by the dotted line in (8.3). The

186                                Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Case    It is worth making a couple of points about the subordinate tree which is associated
with the prepositional phrase in (9.4). Firstly, prepositional phrases are phrases and
not clauses; they are not tensed and do not have truth values and so cannot constitute
well-formed propositions on their own. This is reﬂected in the fact that the lexical
actions associated with the prepositional phrase can only be processed in the context
of a LINK transition from a superordinate semantic tree. Nonetheless, the LINKed
tree is an expression of type t, a proposition, in that it expresses a relation between
two terms, and in the case of (9.4) one of them is an event argument. A prepositional
phrase thus constitutes a kind of dependent proposition. Secondly, the lexical actions
associated with the preposition do not supply an event argument. Instead, they ka
copy the formula value from the head of the LINK transition to the logical subject
node of the subordinate tree. In (9.4), this shared term happens to be an event.3
    Up to this point, the parser has processed aːfʊ ʊrʊneːne kete. This is a grammatical
sentence, ‘ants are crawling on me’, which is reﬂected in the fact that the semantic
structure so far constructed is made up of two well formed propositional structures
(one a LINKed sub-tree of the other). If there were no more lexical material to be
parsed in (9.1), the pointer would return to the matrix tree, the metavariable U on
the matrix logical subject node would be uniﬁed with the unﬁxed node and a step of
LINK-Evaluation would apply leading to the ﬁnal tree in (9.7) which represents the
conjoined proposition that ants crawl in event si and that the location of this event is
Musa.
   3
     As it stands, there is nothing in the lexical entry (9.4) to prevent the locative phrase modifying an
individual, should the interpretation be that the ants are on me, rather than the ants’ crawling is on
me. In this case the shared term would be an individual and not an event. This would have the eﬀect
of making the LINKed proposition non-ﬁnite, but given that a preposition cannot project a matrix
clause, this should cause no problem.

                                  F o(Musa′ )9.2 Recursive locative prepositional phrases
The tree given in (9.7) represents the logical form of the sentence aːfʊ ʊrʊneːne kete,
‘ants are crawling on me’. But the sentence in (9.1) speciﬁes the location of the event
further, ‘ants are crawling on my body’. Katcha expresses this by means of a second
locative phrase following the ﬁrst. A parallel construction is found in English (the
assailant punched me on the nose) though in English this only occurs following direct
objects and not with prepositional phrases (*the assailant landed a punch on me on
the nose).
   Modelling the recursive construction found in Katcha is in principle quite straight-
forward; it is simply a case of moving the pointer to the event argument of the LINKed
tree and applying LINK Introduction again to construct another sub-tree. The act
of moving the pointer, though, requires some motivation. As the analysis currently
stands, the lexical actions of locative ka construct a fully decorated external argument
node and there is therefore no reason for the pointer to return to this node once it
has been built, which prevents its further development. There are two alternative
approaches to overcoming this apparent problem. The ﬁrst is a lexical approach. In
section 6.4.2 it was noted that when the pronoun occurs before a body-part locative
phrase its tone melody appears to diﬀer from the usual pronominal tone pattern.
Further research would need to be conducted on the tone system of Katcha before
making categorical assertions, but if this tone change proves to be consistent, it is
certainly possible that it signals the fact that the locative relation is to be further
speciﬁed. Thus a ﬁrst person pronoun with the usual tone melody (H-H after locative
188                           Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Caseka) would have the lexical entry shown in (9.8a), which decorates a term-requiring node
with a metavariable in the normal way. A ﬁrst person pronoun with the alternative
tone pattern (L-L) would have the lexical entry shown in (9.8b). As well as decorating
the internal argument node with a metavariable, these actions move the pointer to the
external argument node (which is an event variable) and decorate it with a requirement
for a LINK relation to a further proposition.(9.8) a. Lexical entry for été
               IF       ?T y(e)
         été THEN put(F o(Uspkr ), T y(e), ?∃x.F o(x))
                 ELSE     Abort
        b. Lexical entry for ete
                IF        ?T y(e)
                 THEN     put(F o(Uspkr ), T y(e), ?∃x.F o(x))
           ete
                          go(⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↓0 ⟩), put(?⟨L⟩?T y(t))
                 ELSE     AbortAnother step of LINK Introduction can now apply in the usual way and the parse
of the next locative phrase can continue as in the same way as the ﬁrst. The function
of the extra requirement on the event node is to force this otherwise optional action to
take place. The alternative tone pattern signals that the proposition is not complete
after the pronoun has been parsed and that it requires further speciﬁcation.
   The second approach to overcoming the apparent problem of pointer movement
within the LINKed locative propostion, one that does not rely on tonal information, is
a computational one. This involves making an adjustment to the lexical entry for the
preposition such that it decorates its external argument node with a requirement rather
than formula value (9.10) and a concomitant adjustment to the LINK Introduction
rule such that it copies the formula from the head of the LINK to the new sub-tree as
an annotation on an unﬁxed node, rather than as a requirement (9.9). This version
of LINK Introduction, referred to as LINK-COPY Introduction in Kempson
et al. (2001:117), is exactly what is used for bare relative clauses in English (eg the
man Sue likes). In making this move we are altering the roles of the lexical entry
and the computational action slightly. Rather than the computational rule introducing
a requirement and the lexical entry introducing a decorated node, the lexical entry
introduces a requirement and the computational rule introduces an (unﬁxed) decorated
node.

9.7 Conclusion
The basic proposal advanced in this chapter is that prepositional phrases should be
treated as adjuncts. A prepositional phrase speciﬁes an additional property of some
expression of the matrix proposition. In other words, it provides a predicate which
takes such an expression as one of its arguments. That expression may be a term (an
individual or event) in the case of an adjectival PP, or a predicate in the case of an
adverbial PP. In Dynamic Syntax terms, prepositions induce structure which is LINKed
to the matrix propositional tree and which shares semantic content with some node in
the matrix tree.
   The approach to prepositional phrases proposed here treats adjectival prepositions
somewhat diﬀerently to adverbial prepositions. Adjectival PPs are of type e → t while
adverbial prepositions are of type (e → t) → (e → t). This distinction, of course,
is reﬂective of the semantics. An adjectival PP has an intersective interpretation; it
predicates over some term of the matrix proposition to express an additional proposition
concerning that term. An adverbial PP has a subsective interpretation; it predicates
over some predicate of the matrix proposition to express an additional property of that
predicate. Nonetheless, both are prepositional phrases and it should be expected that
they will behave in largely parallel ways. And in fact they do. Despite the diﬀerent
semantic types, all prepositions project a predicate that expresses some relation between
their complement and the expression that they modify. This relation is not part of
the core structure of the matrix proposition, but rather semantically enriches some
expression within it. This can be modelled quite naturally as a separate structure
connected to the modiﬁed expression by means of a LINK.
   The construal of prepositional phrases as LINKed structures, and prepositions as
9.7. Conclusion                                                                      217predicates, explicitly categorises them as modiﬁers. There are therefore substantial
parallels to be seen between prepositional phrases and other modiﬁers. The distinction
between intersective and subsective PPs, for example, parallels the same distinction
seen in the semantics of adjectives. Indeed, Cann (In prep.) suggests an analysis for
English adjectives which directly parallels the one given here: intersective adjectives
induce LINKed structure from the internal variable of an epsilon term (ie. a T y(e)
node), while subsective adjectives induce LINKed structure from the restrictor of an
epsilon term (i.e. a T y(e → t) node). Similarly, the treatment of prepositional phrases
oﬀered here draws explicit parallels between (adjectival) prepositional phrases and
relative clauses. Both prepositional phrases and relative clauses project propositions
which share an argument with the matrix proposition. It is therefore not surprising
that they should use the same basic technical apparatus. The diﬀerence between them
is that relatives include an anaphoric device (either a relative pronoun or a resumptive
pronoun), which introduces the shared argument into their sub-proposition. Like bare
relatives in English, prepositional phrases contain no such anaphoric device so the
shared argument must be introduced by the LINK-COPY Introduction rule.
   Sections 9.5 and 9.6 demonstrated that this analysis is also relevant to constructions
other than prepositional phrases, and both applications have potential theoretical
implications. In section 9.5 it was argued that applicatives can be treated in just
the same way as prepositions, a stance which gains support from the fact that in many
languages the two constructions are related by both a semantic equivalence and by
a history of grammaticalization. The diﬀerence between the two constructions is one
of constituency: the complement of a preposition immediately follows it, whereas the
applied object (which is construed as the complement of the applicative morpheme)
does not necessarily follow immediately after the applicative marker. To state that
applicatives and adpositions are essentially equivalent is therefore something of a
challenge to the importance of the notion of constituency, which is central to most
theories of syntax.
   It was noted in several places, both in chapter 6 and in the present chapter, that
case markers and adpositions represent two ends of a continuum and that there is
no great diﬀerence between them. However, in discussing the diﬀerences between the
Dynamic Syntax construal of case and the account of adpositions given here, section 9.6
laid out what appears to be a quite clear distinction between them. Case is considered
to be a ﬁlter on well-formed structure, specifying where a particular node may be
situated in a tree, but providing no semantic content. On the other hand, adpositions
induce a LINKed sub-tree, building semantic structure and contributing the Formula
value of its predicate. The account oﬀered here can therefore be argued to draw a
substantive theoretical distinction between case and adpositions; the two are quite
diﬀerent within the DS framework. This apparently goes against the general view that
218                          Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casecase and adpositions are actually very similar. However, ‘similar’ is not the same
as ‘identical’. Payne oﬀers a ‘rule of thumb’ for distinguishing case markers from
adpositions which he suggests ‘probably works 90 percent of the time.’ This is the
notion that case marking is imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase
occurs, while adpositions may occur freely. By this deﬁnition, case may be ‘determined
by the grammatical requirements of the verb (or other case-governing element)… Ad-
positional phrases are usually (though not always) “optional” sentence constituents’
(Payne 1997:100-101). The discussion of case and adpositions in section 9.6 might be
thought of as something close to a DS-theoretic characterisation of this ‘rule of thumb’.
With case, the propositional structure and semantic content is projected by the ‘verb
(or other case-governing element)’; case markers simply decorate this structure with
requirements to ensure the correct interpretation of the noun phrase. Adpositions on
the other hand are ‘ “optional” sentence constituents’ because they construct a tree
structure and decorate it with semantic content; moreover, the structure they project
is an adjunct, a LINKed sub-tree. The two deﬁnitions of the diﬀerence between case
and adpositions have a slightly diﬀerent focus though and so they are not quite the
same. Payne’s ‘rule of thumb’ focuses on the obligatoriness of case compared with
the optionality of adpositional constructions; the Dynamic Syntax account oﬀered here
suggests that the diﬀerence is semantic: case morphemes are semantically null and build
no structure, while adpositions contribute semantic content and also induce semantic
structure. The observation that adpositions tend to be more optional is a reﬂection
of the fact that, as modifying adjuncts, the structure they build is outside the main
propositional tree.
   The application of Dynamic Syntax to Katcha prepositional phrases uses only
standard DS rules which have been motivated in other contexts for other constructions
in other languages. Nonetheless, applying these rules to the Katcha data considered
here has implications for our understanding of applicatives and case, as well as for our
understanding of prepositional phrases. The key insight oﬀered here is that preposi-
tional phrases are predicates expressing additional information about some element of
the core proposition of an utterance.
Chapter 10Nominal ModiﬁersIntroduction
This chapter provides a Dynamic Syntax analysis of nominal modiﬁers in Katcha. It
follows on from the arguments advanced in chapter 5 that nominal modiﬁers can be
characterised as demonstrative pronouns or phrases headed by demonstrative pronouns
which stand in apposition to the nouns that they modify. Section 10.1 sets out some
context. It gives an analysis of nouns, noting that lexical nouns cannot be modiﬁed
internally so they must project a fully speciﬁed epsilon structure, and discusses the pro-
cess of LINK Apposition and its evaluation used to allow modiﬁcation. Demonstratives
are also covered, with a discussion of how a demonstrative pronoun can add speciﬁc
referential content to a lexical noun phrase.
   Section 10.2 gives an analysis of subject relative clauses. Crucial to this is an
extension to the notion of the metavariable projected by the demonstrative pronoun
such that it projects a partial epsilon term with a variable and binder, but no restrictor.
The relative clause can then provide the restrictor.
   A similar analysis is given in section 10.3 where it is suggested that a contextually
provided possession predicate provides the restrictor to the epsilon term projected by
the pronoun. Interestingly, it is shown that this has to be a ‘possessed by’ rather than
a ‘possess’ relation, which ﬁts the fact that possessive phrases in Katcha agree with the
head noun and not the possessor.
   Finally, in section 10.4, some brief suggestions are given as to how non-subject
relatives may be analysed. It is noted that the analysis of demonstrative pronouns
given here correctly predicts that non-subjects are unable to be relativised directly.","[235, 236, 237, 238]"
"5.5.1 Relatives
Given the analysis of já/mɔ́/nɔ́ as a demonstrative pronoun, it might be assumed that
in a relative clause it would play the role of a relative pronoun. From a typological point
of view, this would be distinctly surprising. Cross-linguistically, relative pronouns are
an uncommon way of encoding relativization, and are largely non-existent in Africa.
Of the 166 languages whose subject-relativization strategies are surveyed in WALS
(Comrie and Kuteva 2013a), only 12 make use of relative pronouns. Of those, 11 are
European languages and the twelfth is North American. Furthermore, the majority of
relative pronouns are derived from interrogative morphemes; it is extremely rare for a
demonstrative to be the source of a relative pronoun. This contrasts with the case of
invariant relative complementizers, which often derive from demonstratives (de Vries
2002; Gisborne and Truswell 2016). A demonstrative pronoun acting as a relative
pronoun is therefore not something we would expect to ﬁnd in Katcha.
     In fact, there are ways in which the demonstrative head of a relative clause in Katcha
does not act as a classic relative pronoun. The deﬁnition of the ‘relative pronoun
strategy’ used in WALS is that ‘the position relativized is indicated inside the relative
clause by means of a clause-initial pronominal element, and this pronominal element
is case-marked (by case or by an adposition) to indicate the role of the head noun
within the relative clause’ (Comrie and Kuteva 2013a). This is contrasted with the
‘gap strategy’ where ‘there is no overt case-marked reference to the head noun within
the relative clause’ (Comrie and Kuteva 2013a). Case-marking is therefore central to
Comrie and Kuteva’s deﬁnition. In section 6.6, it will be suggested that case on Katcha
pronouns may be indicated by tone. Since the tone on the demonstrative morpheme
appears to remain consistently high, this suggests that there is no case marking. So by
this deﬁnition, Katcha uses a ‘gap strategy’ for subject relatives, as would be expected
given its genetic and geographical location. Also, note that non-subject relative clauses
often utilise a resumptive pronoun (section 5.3). The internal syntax of non-subject
relatives is yet to be investigated (pending a study of dependent and non-ﬁnite clauses),
but a couple of implications can be drawn from this fact. Firstly, as with the gap
strategy for subject relatives, a resumptive strategy for non-subject relatives is not
out of place genetically or geographically (Comrie and Kuteva 2013b). Secondly, the
5.5. Cross-linguistic connections                                                        89presence of a resumptive implies that it is this rather than the demonstrative which
encodes ‘the syntactic-semantic role of the head noun in the relative clause’ (Comrie and
Kuteva 2013c). By these deﬁnitions then, the demonstrative is not a relative pronoun
in the classic sense.
   A better characterisation of the role of the demonstrative in Katcha relative clauses
is that it is a ‘relative marker’ (RM) in the sense described by de Vries (2002). Following
Lehman (1984), de Vries argues that there are three possible functions of a relative
element: Subordination, Attribution and Gap Construction (de Vries 2002:155), and
that an RM is a ‘type of relative particle that has just the Attribution function’ (de Vries
2002:170). That is, an RM encodes the fact that the relative clause is attributed to
the head. There are four distinctive characteristics of relative markers, all of which are
true for Katcha (de Vries 2002:174-176): i) RMs are attested only in post-nominal relative clauses. ii) RMs occupy the ﬁrst position in the relative clause.iii) RMs show at least some overt evidence of agreement with the head noun.iv) RMs are predominantly found in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages.","[107, 108]"

It was demonstrated in section 4.2 that Katcha has three gender classes and that the
semantic number of an unmarked noun is not generally relevant to its gender agreement
properties (other than in the case of male/female animate referents). However, it
has been shown in this section that morphological number is very relevant to gender,
since the number-marking aﬃx on a noun assigns it gender. For nouns which are
morphologically marked for number, gender classiﬁcation is a property of the number
aﬃx and not of the root noun.
     Because a noun’s gender is determined by its number-marking aﬃx, this may result
in diﬀering gender between semantically singular and semantically plural forms of the
4.4. The third gender as ‘Plural’                                                      59same noun. This phenomenon, known as polarity (following Meinhof (1910:135-6)),
is well attested in the Cushitic and Semitic branches of Afroasiatic. Dimmendaal
(1987:172) speculates whether polarity in Krongo may indicate earlier contact between
the Kadu languages and other language families. Whatever the origins, in Katcha
a noun’s gender in the singular may diﬀer from its gender in the plural and this
is determined by the singulative or plurative aﬃx. There is therefore a very clear
interaction between number marking and nominal gender.","[77, 78]"

7.2 Valency reducing suﬃxes7.2.1 Antipassive
A verb suﬃxed with an Antipassive marker corresponds to Stevenson’s “Intransitive
Stem” (Stevenson 1941:110). There are two main Antipassive suﬃxes, the choice of
which appears to be lexically determined by the verb. Probably the more common is
-VnV (7.8b-7.11b), while -VkV (7.12b-7.13b) is also attested. In both cases the quality
of the vowel in the suﬃx varies according to the vowel(s) in the verb root. The tone on
the suﬃx also varies but there does not seem to be any clear pattern to this variation.(7.8) a. akká      m-ʊ́ ʊ́      mɪ ́kɪle

(7.14b). This appears to be a unique suﬃx: no other examples of an antipassive -rɪ are
attested in my data, and Stevenson also states that it it is ‘an unusual form’ (Stevenson
1941:110). In addition, there is no sign of the vowel harmony between suﬃx and root
which appears to exist for -VnV and -VkV. It may therefore be better to think of akʊ́rɪ ́
as a separate intransitive verb (though one clearly related to the transitive akʊ́).(7.14) a. kʊ́kkʊ́ akʊ́          mɪ ́teene

132                                        Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Verb ExtensionsAs stated in section 7.1, the simple form of the Katcha verb is always the transitive.
This is rather striking in examples such as ‘wake’ (7.10a) and ‘laugh’ (7.11a). It is not
hard to conceive that a language might treat the intransitive ‘wake’ as the less complex
form, rendering the transitive with a causative or similar device. Similarly, it seems
intuitive that in English, intransitive ‘laugh’ is semantically more basic than transitive
‘laugh at’, a fact which is reﬂected in the morphosyntax. This is not the case in Katcha.
Morphologically at least, the transitive is always the simpler form, with the intransitive
being formed by the use of the Antipassive suﬃx.
   Semantically, the Antipassive is used where the identity of the semantic theme or
patient is unknown or unimportant to the point of non-existence. As a (relatively) fully
pro-drop language, a clause in which the patient is known or implied may be expressed
using an ordinary transitive verb. (7.15a) gives an example of a verb whose object,
being implied, is simply ‘dropped’. (For comparison, (7.15b) shows the same verb with
a full complement of overt object arguments.)(7.15) a. n-aɗáŋŋá êːne
            1s-give    3p
            ‘I give (it) to them’                                          (THIEF:1.19)
        b. m-aɗáŋŋá nuk-urúːnú ʊ́ŋŋɔ́          k-áʈábbʊ́
            3f-give       pl-year         1pl.excl 3p-be.many
            ‘she gives many years to us’                                  (TEACH:1.60)Both the transitive and the antipassive forms of the verb, then, may occur with no
overt syntactic object. The key distinction between them is semantic: a transitive verb
with an implied semantic object is expressed using an unmarked transitive form; a
transitive verb with no object (implied or otherwise) is expressed using a verb with an
Antipassive suﬃx.
   Stevenson (1956-57:58) states that the Antipassive suﬃx (which he calls ‘Qualita-
tive’) may in fact be used with ‘indeﬁnite objects’, in which case it has a general or
habitual interpretation. He gives one example:(7.16) bibala iyana                  fɔ
        ɓɪːɓala ɪja-ana             eːfɔ
        boy     3m.milk-antip cows
        ‘The boy milks cows, (i.e. he cow-milks in general).’      (Stevenson 1956-57:58)Although (7.16) has a syntactic object, it seems clear that the sentence does not
refer to an event in which any individual actually undergoes milking, i.e. the semantic
theme/patient has no denotation. To that extent, this construction is still in keeping
7.2. Valency reducing suﬃxes                                                                     133with the function of these suﬃxes. It is probably still appropriate to think of the suﬃx
as marking antipassive.27.2.2 Passive (‘Personal Passive’)
The suﬃx -tené marks a verb as passive. The subject agreement marker on the verb
agrees with the syntactic subject, which carries the thematic role of theme/patient:(7.17) a. akká        m-ʊnɪ     kʊ́rɪ
             woman 3f-cook food
             ‘a woman is cooking food’
         b. kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-t n ́
             food 3m.pfv-cook-pass
             ‘the food is being cooked’
(7.18) a. ómúɗi ́ abʊ́       ámbâ
             man      3m.hit drum
             ‘the man is hitting a drum’
         b. ambá m-abʊ-t n ́ ká         tábeːne
             drum 3f-hit-pass loc wrestling
             ‘the drum is being hit for wrestling’The -tené suﬃx is used where there is an implied agent and as such is described by
Stevenson as a “true passive” (Stevenson 1941:113). He states that ‘it often implies
that someone is implicated in the action, and may have a noun complement’ (Stevenson
1941:113), giving (7.19) as an example which includes an explicit agent introduced by

over a hundred occurences of verbs with passive morphology3 , but only two examples
have noun complements which might be considered to be the agent.                         Neither are
unambiguous. To give an example, the noun phrase kadu nyeꞌdꞌde... in (7.20) appears
to be a potential candidate for the agent of kussudene. The sentence would then
mean ‘God’s wisdom is known by all who accept God’s words’. However, we cannot
discount the possibility that this noun phrase plays a more oblique semantic role, such
as cause. That is, ‘God’s wisdom is known because of those who accept his words’,
with the knower(s) being an implied third party. Indeed, if the English translation and
the Katcha translation accurately paraphrase the same proposition, the latter is the
favoured reading.(7.20) ataꞌdara ma         ogo kussudene            [ka     kadu     nyeꞌdꞌde kungngo

         ‘God’s wisdom is shown to be true by all who accept it.’                       (LUKE 7:35)It seems then that the agent of a passive construction is made explicit very rarely, if at
all. If the agent of an event is important enough to the discourse to be made explicit,
the passive suﬃx is unlikely to be used. An analysis of discourse structure lies outwith
the scope of this study, but given that syntactic subjects can occur after the verb as
well as before, it is perhaps a plausible speculation that word order, rather than verbal
morphology, is the device used to signal the relative prominence of verbal arguments.
   3
     There are in fact 202 instances of words carrying the -tene passive suﬃx, but a number of these
are derived nominal forms, such as katalaadene, ‘disciples’ (from laala, ‘teach’, thus ‘people who are
taught’)
7.2. Valency reducing suﬃxes                                                          1357.2.3 Unaccusative (‘Impersonal Passive’)
Although the agent of a verb marked with Passive -tené is seldom stated explicitly, it
appears that its existence is nevertheless always implied. This contrasts with the other
passive-like suﬃx -nca, which is described by Stevenson as ‘Stative or Neuter-Passive’
(Stevenson 1956-57:57). It has no obvious agent and in this sense can be thought of as
an ‘impersonal’ type of passive. Perhaps the most useful term to use to describe this
form is ‘Unaccusative’.
   Unaccusatives are deﬁned by Perlmutter, within the framework of Relational Gram-
mar, as containing ‘a 2-arc but no 1-arc’ (Perlmutter 1978:160). That is to say, they
have an underlying direct object (usually the semantic Patient) which is ‘advanced’ to
the position of subject but, unlike passives, have no Agent argument to be ‘demoted’
to an oblique position. Expressing this in more theory-neutral terms, an Unaccusative
verb can be deﬁned as one whose syntactic subject is its Patient/Theme argument and
which has no Agent argument. This is exactly the situation which occurs with the
Katcha -nca suﬃx and so ‘Unaccusative’ would seem to be an appropriate name for
this suﬃx.
   The contrast in meaning between Passive and Unaccusative forms can be seen in
(7.21-7.23). Stevenson (1941:113-114) suggests that ‘the general implication’ of a verb
marked with -nca ‘is ﬁnality, or state.’ Clearly, this does not mean that a verb marked
with -nca must carry a stative/generic meaning: whilst this does appear to be the case
for (7.23), examples (7.21-7.22) both refer to single events. Rather, it is a question of
how the event is viewed. In the passive (7.21a/b, 7.22a) the focus is on the event itself,
which is seen as an action and therefore has an implied agent. In the unaccusative
(7.21c, 7.22b) the focus is on the result of the event, which is seen as a process and
therefore has no implied agent. In both the passive and the unaccusative, the syntactic
subject is the semantic undergoer (i.e. the patient) of the event described by the verb.(7.21) a. kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-t n ́
             food 3m.cook-pass
             ‘the food is being cooked’

               drum 3f-hit-unacc loc wrestling
               ‘the drum is hit for wrestling’ (habitually)The Unaccusative is frequently followed by a locative adverb5 , such as kʊ́ɓʊ́, ‘down’
in (7.21c) and (7.22b). This does not appear to be obligatory, and never appears when
there is some other complement of the verb (as in (7.23b)). However, where there is no
complement, it seems to be strongly preferred.
      There is a connection between the Unaccusative and the Antipassive, which mani-
fests in two ways. The ﬁrst is morphological. Stevenson states that the Unaccusative
suﬃx is ‘by preference attached to intransitive verbs’ (Stevenson 1941:114). An example
of this is shown in (7.22b). According to my data, the preference is not quite as strong
as Stevenson’s statement suggests; indeed, his own data includes as many verbs with
-nca attached to a transitive stem as to an intransitive one. Stevenson’s examples of
verbs where -nca attaches to an Antipassive suﬃx largely concur with mine, suggesting
that this is perhaps a lexical preference. Nonetheless, there appear to be a reasonable
number of these, so it seems fair to say that there is at least some correlation between
these two forms of the verb.
    The second way in which Unaccusative and Antipassive are connected is a semantic
one, seen in (7.23b). Like the Antipassive (see example 7.16), the Unaccusative can
be used to describe events with a general scope or of a habitual nature. Thus while
(7.23a) describes a present event, (7.23b) describes a habitual situation.

      Tones and vowel length are uncertain for this verb form.

The suﬃx -ncaːna denotes a type of Middle Voice. Unfortunately, the term ‘middle’
has been used in very diﬀerent ways by diﬀerent authors. To compare three diﬀerent
dictionaries of linguistics, for example: Crystal (2008) mentions only that the Greek
middle ‘included verbs with a reﬂexive meaning’ (eg. She cut herself ); Brown and Miller
(2013) deﬁne middles as verbs whose subject ‘denotes a participant that is neither agent
nor patient but controls the situation’ (eg. One bomb didn’t guide and crashed); ﬁnally,
Matthews (2014) suggests that middles may include both ‘intransitive constructions
that are understood reﬂexively’ (eg. I shaved) and intransitives with ‘a passive-like
relation to [the] subject’ (eg. This stone cuts easily). The typology of voice alternations
in WALS (Siewierska 2013) equates middles with anticausatives, describing them in
similar terms as the unaccusatives discussed in the previous section. In summary,
‘there is no generally accepted deﬁnition or characterization of middle voice, let alone
a satisfactory account of the relations among the various phenomena that have been
given that name’ (Kemmer 1993:1).
   Kemmer (1993:16-20) lists no fewer than thirteen phenomena which languages may
mark morphologically as ‘middles’, including both lexically determined semantic classes
of verbs (eg. ‘grooming’ verbs) and syntactic processes (eg. impersonal middles such as
the book is selling well). She claims that there are two properties common to all of these,
namely ‘1) Initiator as aﬀected entity (Endpoint) and 2) low degree of elaboration of
events’ (Kemmer 1993:238). According to Kemmer then, middles share some simliarity
with reﬂexives and reciprocals but diﬀer in their ‘elaboration of events’. Middles express
events using fewer ﬁne-grained distinctions than reﬂexives or reciprocals do. A reﬂexive
construction such as John washes himself expresses a relation between two participants,
John as agent and himself as patient, and indicates that both participants happen to
denote the same indivdual. On the other hand, a construction which presents the event
more as the action of a single participant (John washes) is likely to be marked as a
middle. Similarly, Kemmer argues that reciprocal marking presents an event as being
made up of two or more relations: John and Mary kissed each other entails John kissed
Mary and Mary kissed John, i.e. a kissing relation holds between John and Mary and
a separate (but possibly concurrent) kissing relation holds between Mary and John.
On the other hand, middle marking presents an event as involving a single, though
two-way, relation between the two participants: John and Mary kissed implies a single
act of kissing. Thus for Kemmer, the key characteristic of middles is that they describe
an event with relatively little elaboration.
   Finally, Payne describes middles as encoding ‘a process undergone by the patient,
rather than […] an action carried out by an agent’ (Payne 1997:216). That is, the
key characteristics of middles for Payne are that they present a situation as a largely
non-agentive process, with the focus therefore on the aﬀected participant.
138                                        Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Verb Extensions    Kemmer’s and Payne’s deﬁnitions of middle voice are not exactly the same as one
another but taken together they seem to describe the Katcha data. In Katcha, verbs
marked with -ncaːna express the notion that the subject is both ‘initiator’ and ‘end-
point’ to the extent that, in the draft Katcha New Testament, <njaana> is sometimes
written as a separate word and glossed as ‘one another’. However, the verb appears to
express a single event with a single participant, with the subject an aﬀected participant
rather than an agent. Examples are given in (7.24-7.26).6(7.24) a        tumma no               tanyalanjaana   kuꞌbu ka       ꞌbuugu koona nyeꞌdꞌde

syntactic subject (whilst arguably also the the agent-like argument) has a clear patient-
like status. Thus the verb asanːa, glossed as ‘disperse’ in (7.26), is elsewhere used
transitively to mean ‘spray’ (eg. m-asanːa kɔnʈɔ ‘3f-spray perfume’). Likewise in
(7.27), which is the active equivalent of (7.24), it can be seen that the morphologically
simple verb aɲala is transitive, taking an overt object tʊmːa ‘words/news’. In (7.24),
where aɲalancaːna carries the Middle Voice suﬃx, there is no syntactic object and
tʊmːa has become the syntactic subject.

logically, the forms of the two suﬃxes appear to be related (/ncaːna/ and /nca/
respectively). Syntactically, the Middle, like the Unaccusative, is generally followed
by a locative adverb; most commonly this is kʊɓʊ ‘down’, as in (7.24-7.26) but there
are examples where a Middle verb is followed by kɔɗɔ ‘up’. Semantically, both the
Unaccusative and the Middle downplay the role of the agent, to the extent that there
is arguably either no agent at all or the agent is subsumed under the patient.
      My data on middle voice in particular is quite limited, but perhaps the diﬀerence
between the unaccusative and the middle is that middle voice focuses more on the pro-
cess described by the verb, while the unaccusative generally describes an achievement
with more of a focus on the state resulting from an action.","[147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158]"

                  b = ϵz , Shatter′ (z)(a))   (8.47) represents a proposition that a shattered b where a is any arbitrary stone
shatterer and b is any arbitrary shatteree. In other words, this represents an event of
shattering where neither the agent nor the patient are speciﬁed. This is exactly what
might be expected from a verb carrying both antipassive and unaccusative morphology,
but it does not appear to capture the fact that it was stones which shattered in the
situation being described. In fact, this is only an apparent problem. Epsilon terms
carry inherent existential force, meaning that the situation described in (8.47) involves
not only a shatterer and a shatteree, but also stones. This is most clearly seen when the
formula in (8.47) is translated into a formula of standard predicate logic. Algorithmic
8.5. Middle Voice                                                                                    177rules for this conversion (‘Q-Evaluation Rules’) are deﬁned in Kempson et al. (2001:241-
243). Applying them to (8.47) results in (8.48).(8.48) ∃x∃y∃z[Stones′ (x) ∧ Shatter′ (x)(y) ∧ Shatter′ (z)(y) ∧ Shatter′ (z)(y)]    The proposition in (8.48) is true just in case there are stones which shattered, while
the agent of the shattering is unspeciﬁed. From a truth conditional point of view, this
interpretation is exactly the same as the interpretation of the unaccusative. Given the
similarities between the middle voice and the unaccusative noted in table 8.1 and in
section 7.2.4, this is a welcome result. It is notable that the treating the verb as having
both an unaccusative and an antipassive morpheme still results in an unaccusative
interpretation. As may be clear from the derivation just outlined, this is because the
unaccusative suﬃx precedes the antipassive and is processed ﬁrst. It is therefore the
unaccusative which determines the tree position of the term projected by the sentential
subject (step (8.43) above). The incremental nature of the parsing process is therefore
crucial in providing the correct interpretation.11
    The Dynamic Syntax construal of terms as having internal complexity is also key
to this explanation. The unaccusative suﬃx expresses the external argument of the
predicate (some arbitrary shatterer), while the antipassive suﬃx expresses the internal
argument of the predicate (some arbitrary shatteree). If the terms projected by these
morphemes did not have internal structure, there would be no room for a lexical argu-
ment in addition (i.e. the syntactic subject stones). But because terms are construed
as epsilon terms, it is possible for the term ϵx , Stones′ (x) to be incorporated into the
term projected by the unaccusative morpheme, and ultimately to surface in the ﬁnal
propositional formula as ∃x[Stones′ (x)]. The internal structure of arguments essentially
allows the three argument-projecting morphemes to instantiate two argument roles, and
to do so quite naturally.
    The truth conditional interpretation of (8.48) is entirely expressed by the ﬁrst two
conjuncts. The third and fourth conjuncts are superﬂuous from a semantic point of
view. But as noted above, Stevenson (1941:112) claims that the antipassive suﬃxes
‘sometimes intensify the meaning of the parent verb.’ Stevenson’s presentation of the
data on this matter is somewhat opaque and not entirely convincing. Nevertheless, it
is notable that adding the antipassive suﬃx to an unaccusative verb causes the ﬁnal
  11
     In section 7.2.5 it was noted that for some verbs, the unaccusative suﬃx appears to attach to the
antipassive, rather than to the transitive verb stem (7.22b). This causes a problem for the current
analysis. Parsing the two morphemes in order would result in the inverse of the analysis just described
for middle voice; such verbs would be expected to have an antipassive interpretation. In fact, their
interpretation is unaccusative with the apparent antipassive morpheme seeming to make no semantic
contribution. It is not clear how these data might be integrated into the analysis as it currently stands,
other than it was noted in section 7.2.5 that there is some evidence that verbs with the antipassive are
(or may be becoming) more lexicalised than other VE forms. It may be that some of these ‘antipassive’
verbs are better treated as genuinely intransitive verbs.

repetition of the action in (8.48) expresses intensivity: There are stones and the stones
are shattered and there is shattering and there is shattering. This is largely speculation,
but if it were correct it would constitute a remarkable explanation of the correlation
between the valency changing function of the middle voice and Stevenson’s claims that
-VnV may encode intensive action, an explanation that falls out naturally from the
interaction between the two detransitivizing suﬃxes.","[195, 196, 197]"

There is evidence to suggest that the já/má/ná found with possessors and at the
beginning of relative clauses is a phonologically conditioned allomorph of the já/mɔ́/nɔ́
found in demonstrative noun phrases and at the end of relative clauses.
     There are notable phonetic diﬀerences between já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́.         The
former generally have a shorter, more neutral vowel, which is often subject to vowel
elision and harmony, both of which are very common general processes in Katcha.
The tone of this vowel appears to be high but these morphemes are frequently run
together with the following word (often eliding the vowel) such that it can be hard
to establish tone accurately. The vowel also has a tendency to harmonise to some
degree with the following vowel. So although generally written as <ya ma na>,
pronunciation may vary according to the vowel that follows (eg. [jɪ ́ mɪ ́ nɪ ]́ or [jɔ́ mɔ́
nɔ́]). The vowel harmony is not always as complete as in some other contexts (the vowel
harmony between noun stem and number preﬁx, for example), presumably due to the
word boundary: /má kʊ́kkʊ̂/ does often sound closer to [m ́ gʊ́kʊ̂] than to [mʊ́gʊ́kʊ̂] or
[mɔ́gʊ́kʊ̂]. It can be diﬃcult to distinguish the exact vowel quality though, because the
vowel is often very short or, as noted above, elided altogether in the case of a following
vowel. This is in marked contrast with the já/mɔ́/nɔ́ morphemes which have slightly
longer, more pronounced vowels. They are much less prone to elision before a vowel
and carry an exceptionally high tone.
     Signiﬁcantly, the syntactic distribution of these forms is complementary within the
noun phrase: já/má/ná (possessive marker and clause-initial relative marker) occurs at
the beginning of a nominal modiﬁer; já/mɔ́/nɔ́ (demonstrative and clause-ﬁnal relative
marker) occurs only at the end. There is a strong argument therefore that the phonetic
diﬀerences are to do with phrasal intonation. The já/mɔ́/nɔ́ marker occurs at the end
of the noun phrase; importantly, it generally occurs before a pause. This, combined
with the extra-high tone, serves to give it a notable emphasis. In the case of the
demonstratives, there is naturally something contrastive about their semantics, and it
would seem to be this that is reﬂected in the intonation. Relative clauses are generally
parenthetical; again the intonation seems to reﬂect this with a higher than usual tone on
the clause-ﬁnal relative marker and a pause before continuing with the matrix clause. In
contrast, the já/má/ná marker occurs at the beginning of the modiﬁer and consequently
does not carry the same contrastive or parenthetical intonation. It behaves like most
short non-lexical Katcha words (eg. prepositions): undergoing vowel harmony, elision,
etc.
     Evidence that the diﬀerence between já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ is primarily intona-
tional can be seen in example (5.35), where the demonstrative morpheme nɔ́ occurs at
the end of a left-dislocated object noun phrase a tʊ́mːá nɔ́, ‘these words’:

        ‘I want to tell you these words’                                      (TEACH:1.48)In this case, there is no contrastive intonation or pause and the vowel of the demonstra-
tive is elided before the pronoun: [adʊ́mːánáː]. Thus this is an example of demonstrative
nɔ́ being realised as n- before a vowel, exactly as the possessive/relative markers ná
would be, apparently due to the intonational properties of its position in the sentence.
Note that (5.35) is not an example of a relative marker: the subject pronoun is in
the wrong case (nominative rather than oblique), the verb is ﬁnite and there is no
corresponding clause-ﬁnal relative marker. All of these indicate that this sentence is
made up of a single main clause (in addition to the fact that there is no other candidate
for a matrix verb in this sentence). The analysis of this noun phrase as a left-dislocated
demonstrative phrase also concurs with the translation provided by Katcha speakers
and the spelling suggested by them (<no> rather than <na>).
     Some additional evidence that já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are allomorphs comes from
the spelling conventions used in literature written by Katcha speakers (in particular,
the draft Katcha New Testament). When possessive and clause-inital relative markers
(já/má/ná) occur with the oblique argument marker t- they are consistently written as
<tiya tamo tano>3 even when preceding a vowel. When these markers occur without
the t- and precede a vowel, they are consistently written as a preﬁx <y-/m-/n->.
When they occur without the t- but precede a consonant, they are generally written
as <ya/ma/na>. Thus the same morpheme may be spelled three ways according to
context. Signiﬁcantly, spellings with <-o> and spellings with <-a> are both used
in diﬀerent contexts for what is clearly the same morpheme, despite the fact that
this spelling alternation does not reﬂect the phonetic realisation. Spelling habits
should certainly not be taken as conclusive (it may simply be that certain spellings
are becoming conventionalised in the vernacular literature), but they may be extra
evidence that Katcha speakers do not distinguish between these morphemes.
   3
     The team also sometimes write <tammo> and <tanno>, but I am not convinced the consonant is
long.

      evidence.
Having noted the evidence that já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are phonologically conditioned
allomorphs, the question arises as to the nature of this morpheme. Based on the
morphosyntactic properties presented in sections 5.1-5.3, this section argues that it is
in fact the proximal demonstrative pronoun, acting as head of the modiﬁer phrase. A
possible alternative answer is that the já/mɔ́/nɔ́ morpheme is simply a general marker
of modiﬁcation. The latter suggestion does not ﬁt the Katcha data as well as the
analysis proposed here but it should be noted that the two analyses are related, and in
section 5.5.2 it is speculated that Katcha may be in the midst of a move from one to
the other.
     It was demonstrated in sections 5.1-5.3 that demonstratives, possessive noun phrases
and relative clauses all display the same morphosyntactic properties with respect to
gender agreement, the modiﬁcation of peripheral arguments and pronominal use. Some
relevant examples are repeated below (5.36-5.44).4Gender agreement(5.36), (5.37) and (5.38) demonstrate that gender agreement is exhibited by demon-
stratives, possessives and relatives, respectively.(5.36) a. omuɗi já              aɗiːla

              ‘That one (way over there)’     The medial and distal demonstratives behave exactly like all other modiﬁers, except
that they do not take j-/m-/n- ‘preﬁxes’. This concurs with the evidence presented
in the preceding sections that j-/m-/n- are not preﬁxes which attach to modiﬁers,
but are themselves the modiﬁers. Moreover, the only nominal modiﬁers which are
not of the form já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are the medial and distal demonstratives. If the já/mɔ́/nɔ́
morpheme which introduces a possessive noun phrase or a relative clause is the prox-
imal demonstrative, then there is a uniﬁed analysis which accounts for all examples:
nouns in Katcha may be modiﬁed only by demonstratives, or by phrases headed by
demonstratives.
     As mentioned in section 5.1.2, there is evidence that demonstratives should be con-
sidered pronouns rather than determiners; in fact, there are no determiners in Katcha.
Since there are also no adjectives, Katcha has no modiﬁers that are unambiguously
internal to the noun phrase. This suggests that lexical nouns form complete noun
phrases and cannot be modiﬁed directly, from within the noun phrase. That is to say,
a noun phrase (in Minimalist terms, a DP) may be made up only of a noun. The
demonstrative is a pronoun which can be considered to stand in apposition with the
noun, taking its reference anaphorically. (5.2′ ) & (5.6c′ ) repeat some of the examples
given earlier, with an altered free translation which is more reﬂective of this analysis:(5.2′ ) a a n-asáːsá     ɲɔrɔɲɔrɔ́ já

    When the demonstrative is followed by a noun, it is interpreted with a possessive
meaning. (5.10c′ ), (5.11′ ) & (5.17′ ) repeat some of the examples given earlier, with

a subject relative clause. The demonstrative pronoun replaces the subject agreement
marker in this case. If the subject agreement marker is thought of as an incorporated
pronoun (as suggested by Norton (2008b)), then this is entirely natural. One pronoun,
the demonstrative, has simply taken the place of another, the subject marker (5.18′ ):(5.18′ ) miːte [j-akʊ́              ɔ́ːjɔ́    já   ] amaːla

Katcha using a construction parallel to that used for possessives. The relative clause
is non-ﬁnite or nominalised, as indicated by the dependent clause marker ka (and
also sometimes the inﬁnitive marker t-). Thus non-subject relatives can be seen as
a ‘possessive’ relation holding between two ‘nominals’: the head noun, and the event
described by the relative clause. (5.21′ ) & (5.22b′ ) repeat examples given earlier, with
glosses and free translations more reﬂective of this analysis.(5.21′ ) a a n-ɪcɪ ́     ráːká [já        fi ́ːjɔ ka   t-akʊ́rɪ kɪte     já       ]

           ‘A hen, this one of my seeing it, is eating sesame’     It should be noted that the morpheme at the end of a relative clause does not
quite ﬁt the analysis as explained here. It does not seem to be appositional to any
other nouns and does not take a t- preﬁx when within an oblique phrase. Both of
these facts follow from its position at the end of the clause in that it does not directly
follow the modiﬁed noun, and the t- preﬁx attaches to the clause-initial morpheme.
Note also that its status is somewhat unclear. Stevenson (1956-57:63-64) states that it
marks deﬁniteness, implying that it is optional. If this were true, the analysis should
be straightforward, conﬁrming the morpheme to be a demonstrative. On the other
hand, Gilley (2013:502) suggests that it is obligatory for masculine nouns, optional
for feminine, and unattested for plural, which would make the analysis somewhat
trickier. Neither of these descriptions quite match my data: the relative clause-ﬁnal
marker seems to be present fairly consistently. Interestingly though, in chapter 10
a Dynamic Syntax analysis of Katcha relative clauses is given which assumes the
clause-ﬁnal relative marker to be a demonstrative. On the basis of that assumption it
transpires that the role of the ﬁnal morpheme is to contribute deﬁniteness; in other
words, Stevenson is predicted to be correct.
     The analysis that nominal modiﬁers comprise noun phrases in apposition, gets
some extra support from the wider tendencies of Katcha syntax, in that Katcha has a
tendency also to put verbs and clauses in apposition. Thus, while (5.49) is a perfectly
grammatical way of expressing the proposition ‘Kuku is a tall man’, (5.50) is equally
grammatical, and probably more common.

pronouns in apposition to the modiﬁed noun is to be favoured. This analysis allows the
medial and distal demonstratives to be treated alongside the proximal demonstrative.
It is not strange that the medial and distal demonstratives do not carry the j-/m-/n-
preﬁxes; the ‘preﬁxes’ are in fact the proximal demonstrative. The analysis proposed
here also ﬁts both the simple structure of Katcha noun phrases (no determiners or
adjectives) and the tendency of Katcha to also put verb phrases in apposition.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]"

with ka. For now it is suﬃcient to see how straightforwardly non-subject relatives may
be integrated into the overall analysis of nominal modiﬁers.10
10.5 Conclusion
The analysis of Katcha nominal modiﬁers proposed in chapter 5 is that they are
uniformly ‘headed’ by demonstrative pronouns appositional to the noun phrase. This
is modelled in the Dynamic Syntax framework using a general computational rule
of Appositive LINK Introduction (10.4). This rule constructs a LINK relation
between two type e nodes which are decorated by epsilon terms projected by two noun
phrases, namely the modiﬁed NP (a lexical noun) and the modiﬁer ‘headed’ by a
demonstrative pronoun. The corresponding evaluation rule (10.9) merges the two into
a single epsilon term with a conjoined restrictor. Thus the properties projected by two
noun phrases in apposition can only be interpreted as holding of a single individual.
       The analysis of demonstrative pronouns presented here extends the actions as-
sociated with them to include the construction of more semantic structure than is
standard in Dynamic Syntax. Pronouns are seen not only to be placeholders but also
to build partial epsilon structures. Speciﬁcally, they project an argument variable and
an epsilon binder, but no restrictor. The restrictor may be provided by substitution
of a referent from context, in which case the demonstrative has a deﬁnite, pronominal
interpretation (section 10.1). Alternatively, it may be provided by a verb, in which
case the demonstrative essentially acts as a relative pronoun (section 10.2). Another
possibility is that the restrictor’s value is constructed from some contextually provided
value expressing some relationship, such as possession, between the argument variable
and some other term (section 10.3). These possibilities directly model the analysis of
chapter 5 where it was argued that the interpretation of a demonstrative pronoun is
dependent on what follows in the rest of the modiﬁer phrase.
       The fact that the demonstrative pronoun projects an internal argument node and
decorates it with a variable restricts how the metavariable can be updated by substitu-
tion and means that the analysis predicts certain correlations which do not necesarily
seem to be related at ﬁrst. For example, the analysis predicts correctly that only
subjects can be relativised directly. Similarly, the predicate of possession is forced to
have as its logical subject the possessee rather than the possessor, which reﬂects the
  10
    An alternative approach would be to assume that the relative clause provides context to enrich
some semantically weak predicate (possibly a metavariable) which holds of the head noun. In this
case the dependent clause marker presumably marks the fact that the verb does not predicate over
the nominal variable but has some other relation to it. Again, a full analysis will need to wait until
the DCM has been studied more carefully. If this were the correct analysis, it would be likely to have
implications for the present account of the semantically weak predicate P OSSD.
250                                         Theoretical Analyses: Nominal Modiﬁersfact that the demonstrative pronoun agrees with the gender of the possessee and not
the possessor.
   Key to this analysis is the strong distinction between pronouns and lexical nouns.
The construal of pronouns as underspeciﬁed forms — metavariables which act as a
placeholder to be updated by additional linguistic or non-linguistic information — con-
trasts with lexical nouns which project macros of actions that build relatively complex
semantic structure. In Katcha, where there are no determiners and no adjectives, the
semantic structure built by lexical nouns is fully speciﬁed and nouns cannot therefore
be modiﬁed directly. The analysis presented both in chapter 5 and here draws a
clear distinction between lexical nouns and pronouns. Lexical nouns form complete
noun phrases in their own right; they cannot be speciﬁed by a determiner or modiﬁed
‘directly’, only by an appositional phrase. The demonstrative pronoun, in contrast,
can be the ‘head’ of a larger phrase which may include modiﬁers. Of course, there are
similarities between nouns and pronouns, both being of semantic type e, but in terms
of syntax — that is, the procedural actions associated with the words — the diﬀerence
is stark. The structure projected by pronouns is fundamentally underspeciﬁed. Nouns
project entire epsilon-structures; pronouns, even the non-standard version presented
here, retain their function of acting as placeholders to be updated by the parsing of
other lexical material. As such, it is no surprise that pronouns should behave diﬀerently
from nouns in allowing ‘direct’ modiﬁcation.
   In contrast, theoretical frameworks which assume that nouns and pronouns both
belong to the same syntactic category, such as ‘DP’, might require more stipulation to
explain why lexical DPs cannot be modiﬁed while pronominal DPs can. This is not to
say that the task would be impossible for such frameworks, but in Dynamic Syntax, it
falls out naturally from the grammar.
Chapter 11ConclusionsIntroduction
This study has been data-led. It did not begin from the position of having a speciﬁc
hypothesis to be tested (other than the very general hypothesis that Dynamic Syntax
may be a suitable framework for the analysis of phenomena found in Nilo-Saharan
languages). Rather, the goal was to investigate the Katcha language with an open
mind, ﬁnd out what was interesting about it and then try to provide a Dynamic Syntax
analysis for that. But in the process certain ﬁndings and themes have emerged. This
concluding chapter starts by summarizing the main ﬁndings of signiﬁcance from the
individual studies in each chapter, before going on to pull out some more general themes.
   Section 11.1 describes some of the main ﬁndings from part II of the thesis. These
are in the areas of number and gender classiﬁcation and nominal modiﬁers. In both of
these areas Katcha exhibits phenomena which have connections with the surrounding
linguistic context, even though some are typologically unusual.
   Section 11.2 summarizes the main ﬁndings from each of the three chapters of
Dynamic Syntax theoretical analysis, pointing out where the theory has had to be
extended or adjusted to ﬁt the data and also any other theoretical implications resulting
from the analyses.
   Finally, section 11.3 provides some ﬁnal comments about what these ﬁndings mean
conceptually.","[267, 268, 269, 270]"
"5.2.1 Possessive NPs modifying Peripheral Arguments
When the possessive noun phrase is not a core argument of the verb (i.e. the head noun
is itself a possessor phrase or a prepositional phrase) this is marked on the possessive

Possessive noun phrases may occur without the head noun. Thus it is possible to answer
a question such as (5.16a) with the short answer in (b):(5.16) a. ɲɔrɔɲɔrɔ́ ócó       ɪ ɪ    ʊŋːɔ́       á   útú k-asáːsâ

              poss.m Kuku
              ‘Kuku’s one’As with demonstratives, this suggests that the possessive particle is pronominal in
nature. Again, it might be argued that (5.16b) is an example of ellipsis, but there are
also examples from the Katcha texts of possessives being used in a slightly diﬀerent
pronominal manner:(5.17) Na          hamada nïïle
         na        hamata ni:le
         poss.p Hamad Nile
         ‘Those of Hamad Nile (i.e. Hamad Nile’s people/family)’                  (SPLA:7)Example (5.17) occurs at the beginning of a sentence with no linguistic antecedent
or other obvious candidate for ellided content. It would seem in this case that the
possessive noun phrase is unquestionably pronominal, taking its referent purely from
context.","[90, 91]"
"
5.3 Relative Clauses
Relative clauses in Katcha are formed using two relative particles, one at the beginning
of the relative clause and one at the end. The clause-initial relative marker is já/má/ná;
the clause-ﬁnal relative marker is já/mɔ́/nɔ́.
     Only subjects can be directly relativised in Katcha. There is no subject agreement
marker on the verb in a relative clause, being replaced by the relative marker. Verb
stems always begin with a vowel, and the vowel of the (ﬁrst) relative marker in subject
relatives elides. At the end of the relative clause is the marker já/mɔ́/nɔ́. Both relative
markers display agreement with the gender of the head noun (5.18):(5.18) a. miːte [j-akʊ́           ɔ́ːjɔ́     já   ] amaːla

             she.goat-pl rel.p-eat grass rel.p 3p-pl-be.brown
             ‘The goats which are eating grass are brown’    Non-subject relatives are formed in a similar, but slightly diﬀerent, way. As with
subject relatives, the subordinate clause is enclosed by relative markers which show
agreement with the head noun. However, the internal structure of the relative clause
is diﬀerent: a non-ﬁnite verb is used, being marked by the dependent clause marker ka
(and sometimes the inﬁnitive marker t-). A resumptive pronoun is also common; this
does not occur in the case of subject relatives. (5.19a-c) give examples of direct objects
being relativised for masculine, feminine and plural gender nouns respectively. (5.20)
demonstrates the relativisation of an indirect object and (5.21) gives an example of an
oblique argument being relativised. Note that in these examples the word following the
(intial) relative marker, the subject of the relative clause, begins with a consonant and
the relative marker is consequently realised as [já/má/ná], rather than the [j-/m-/n-]
seen in the subject relative examples.(5.19) a. miːte [já            kʊ́kkû ka       ɪcɪ ́ ɪ ́ ɪ ́ já       ] akʊ́           ɔ́ːjɔ́

this is once again marked by the addition of t- before the clause-initial relative marker.

Relative clauses may occur without an overt head noun, in which case the relative
marker can be considered to have a pronominal reading.(5.27) a       ya         adïnï atene ka         ïmmï kateene ya

5.3.3 Adjectives
In Katcha adjectives do not form a separate grammatical category, but are a type of
verb. There is some evidence of a slight morphological distinction between adjectival
verbs and more prototypical verbs (an additional morpheme marking semantic plural
in the case of adjectives), but with regard to agreement, adjectives show normal verbal
morphology and behave in the same way as any other intransitve verb.
   When used predicatively as in (5.28-5.30b), adjectives take the usual verbal subject

Assuming attributive adjectives to be relative clauses, there are three kinds of nominal
modiﬁers in Katcha: demonstratives, possessive noun phrases and relative clauses.
These are indicated by the presence of the morphemes listed in table 5.2. Aside from
the medial and distal demonstratives, these three types of nominal modiﬁers are clearly
all related. All three are introduced by similar morphemes showing agreement with the
head noun. It is worth considering the nature of this relation in more detail and in
particular, the question of whether the proximal demonstrative, the possessive marker
and the relative marker are all the same morpheme and, if so, how this chould be
characterised.
   Stevenson (1941) takes a conservative descriptive line, taking the common element
to be just the j-/m-/n- gender agreement preﬁxes, which then attach to diﬀerent
morphemes. Thus, in his view, these gender preﬁxes may attach to the demonstrative
stem -a/-ɔ (Stevenson 1941:58), to the ‘genitive particle’ -a (Stevenson 1941:47) and
‘possessive pronouns’ eːte, etc. (Stevenson 1941:48), and to verbs (Stevenson 1941:68).
Although Stevenson does not explicitly state it as such, this approach essentially
analyses the j-/m-/n- preﬁxes as a general marker of nominal modiﬁers. However,
whilst it seems correct to a large extent, such an analysis does not go far enough in
that it does not incorporate the medial and demonstrative pronouns, which agree in
gender with the head noun, yet do not carry these preﬁxes. This fact is signiﬁcant for
the hypothesis that j-/m-/n- are preﬁxes which mark modiﬁcation generally, because
whilst the existence of a ‘general modiﬁcation’ marker does not preclude the existence
of other constructions, it is surprising to ﬁnd that the possessives and relatives pattern
with the proximal demonstrative, while the medial and distal demonstratives do not.
The remainder of this chapter proposes an alternative analysis which uniﬁes the account
of the three types of nominal modiﬁer, ﬁts the overall patterns of Katcha morphosyntax,
and accounts for the medial and distal demonstratives. The proposed analysis is that
all nominal modiﬁers in Katcha are headed by an initial demonstrative pronoun.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]"

4.4 The third gender as ‘Plural’4.4.1 Plural gender in Katcha
A second aspect of the interaction between number and gender is seen when we consider
the semantic basis of the third gender class. Up to this point, I have followed Tucker
and Bryan (1966) in referring to this third class as ‘Neuter’. This reﬂects the fact
that this is a gender agreement class, in opposition to the classes of Masculine and
Feminine. However, to refer to this class as ‘neuter’ is to miss out on the importance
of its connection with plural number.
   It was mentioned in section 4.2 that some research on Katcha grammar (eg. Waag
2012) has assumed that the third concord agreement marker (ie. /n-/ for nominal
modiﬁers, /k-/ for verbal subject agreement markers) marks plural number rather than
a third gender. That people make this assumption would be surprising if there were no
reason for it. But in fact, there are some very good reasons for it: the third gender is
intimately related to the notion of plural number.
   The ﬁrst reason is a statistical one. As shown in section 4.3.1, the vast majority
of marked plurals belong to the third gender (while their corresponding semantically
singular (unmarked) forms belong to either Masculine or Feminine gender). It is not
surprising that a casual observation would cause one to assume that the /n/ concord
marker indicates plural number.
   The second reason the third gender has been thought of as plural number is a
structural one: there is a strong morphological connection between the third gender
and plural number. The agreement marker which denotes the third gender is the same
as that which denotes semantic plural. That is to say, a noun with a numerically plural
animate referent triggers the same agreement as one which belongs to the third gender.
   Evidence of the unity of these categories comes from pronouns. The pronoun used
to refer to the third gender is the same as the third person plural pronoun. Thus in
(4.34a) the pronoun éːke refers to the ‘neuter’ noun kanʈá, ‘spear’, while in (4.34b) it
refers to the plural human referent kʊ́kkʊ́ nca kákká.
60                                   Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Number and Gender(4.34) a. n-ici        ɔ ɔ kanʈá      i ́ː    a a n-ici            ́k

        b. n-ici       ɔ ɔ kʊ́kkʊ́ nca           kákká     i ́ː    a a n-ici         ́k

             ‘Do you see Kuku and Kaka? Yes, I see them.’The unity of these categories can also be seen in nominal modiﬁers, such as relative
clauses. In (4.35a) the morphemes which mark the relative clause are ná…nɔ́, agreeing
with the ‘neuter’ noun kanʈá; in (4.35b) the same relative markers are used in agreement
with the plural noun phrase jakʊːb nca juhana.(4.35) a. kanʈá ná         maːla       nɔ́         k-ɔʈɔŋkɔrɔ

morpheme highlighted as (4.36a), the subject agreement marker on the verb is /k/,
agreeing with the ‘neuter’ noun kanʈá; in (4.36b) the verb also carries the subject
agreement marker /k/, agreeing with the plural subject katalaːtene.(4.36) a. kanʈá ná        maːla      nɔ́       k-ɔʈɔŋkɔrɔ

(4.34–4.36) cannot easily be dismissed as mere homophony. It was shown in section
4.2 that the gender class a noun belongs to is not a reﬂection of its semantic number.
Semantically plural nouns may trigger any of the three agreement patterns, as may
semantically singular nouns. To suggest that many, but not all, plural nouns require
agreement with their number rather than their gender signiﬁcantly complicates the
picture, and causes a suspicious duplication of classes. As summarised in Table 4.2,
4.4. The third gender as ‘Plural’                                                     61there would be semantically singular nouns taking Masculine, Feminine and Neuter
agreements, there would be semantically plural nouns taking Masculine and Feminine
agreements and there would be semantically plural nouns triggering number agreement
instead of gender agreement. There might also be semantically plural nouns which take
Neuter agreement, but since these would be homophonous with the semantically plural
nouns taking plural number agreement, there would be no way to know. Moreover,
there is no evidence that semantically plural nouns which require gender (ie. Masculine
or Feminine) agreement should be treated as special cases.","[78, 79, 80]"
"The Katcha facts are similar to those of Krongo so Dimmendaal’s arguments also
hold for Katcha.          These locative words should be considered adverbs rather than
postpositions. They regularly occur in constructions where they clearly modify verbs
rather than nouns. In such constructions they occur after both the verb they modify

particularly phrases with the general locative preposition ká. In this way they serve to
further specify the location refered to by the locative phrase. As a modiﬁer, the adverb

tion is also available, where the locative adverb precedes a noun phrase marked by
possessive ma. There does not seem to be any obvious semantic diﬀerence between the
two constructions, and in fact both may be found in the same sentence. In (6.66) we
ﬁnd both ka kadu kiʈa, ‘before men’, and kiʈa ma pʊppa tɪjeːte, ‘before my Father’.(6.66)       möꞌdï ya         amma kede         [ka      kadu     kidha ] ya

(1941:82), kuro only occurs preceding a ma-marked noun phrase and not following a
ka-marked noun phrase. A search through the draft Katcha New Testament aﬃrms
this assertion, in that there are no attested examples of ka__kuro, while kuro ma__
does indeed occur (6.67).
6.4. Modiﬁcation of locative phrases                                                 119(6.67) neꞌbi      taalo ara      teyi     [k rö   ma    rsaliim ]

        ‘no prophet can die outside Jerusalem’                             (LUK 13.33)   One possible explanation for the fact that kuro does not occur with locative noun
phrases might be that this would create a semantic contradiction. The preposition ká
introduces a general location for an event (eg. ‘at’ the denotation of some noun phrase),
which is then further speciﬁed by the locative adverb. But in the case of ‘outside’, the
location of the event is explicitly not ‘at’ the denotation of the noun phrase. In other
words perhaps the reason that ka__kuro does not occur is that it is impossible to be
both ‘at’ something and ‘outside’ it.
   Moreover, Katcha locative adverbs generally appear to be derived from the locative
preposition followed by a noun of location (often a body part). Thus keere ‘behind’ is
derived from ka + eere (‘back’), while kɔːna ‘all over/together’ comes from ka + ɔːna
(‘body’). However, this is not true of kuro, despite its having an initial /k/. In (6.68)
kuro occurs as the complement of dative a suggesting that it is in fact a noun (at least
in this context). In contrast, the complement of a in the corresponding phrase refering
to ‘inside’ is the noun teːne and not the locative adverb kateːne (6.69). This fact is
borne out by Stevenson who gives a probable derivation for all locative adverbs except
kuro.(6.68) a       kadu    tadhi       co a    k rö

no locative adverb meaning ‘outside’) may be considered additional evidence for the
suggestion that there is a semantic incongruity between ká and ‘outside’. This in turn
provides a semantic explanation for the absence of ka__kuro in Katcha.
   Although most commonly used with ká-marked nouns, locative adverbs do some-
times follow other prepositional phrases, primarily in directional contexts. The seman-

     This ﬁnal point, that the updating process includes the construction of the restrictor node, is
notable. The process described here is not merely one of Substitution of a Formula value as deﬁned
in Cann et al. (2005:72), but involves the abduction of structure. Formalising this process will require
to be done carefully, to ensure there is an appropriate trigger for the construction of structure, and
that monotonicity is retained; it is not clear that a free pragmatic process like substitution should
be allowed to build structure in an unconstrained manner. I leave this formality to one side for the
present.

there is an oustanding ?T y(t) requirement at its argument daughter which must be
fulﬁlled. As noted above, one way of fulﬁlling this requirement is by Substitution
of the metavariable with an epsilon-term and abduction of the necessary structure
from that. However, all rules in DS are optional and in the case of the relative clause
Substitution does not apply; the pointer is therefore compelled to move to the node
with the unfulﬁlled requirement. With the pointer now at the ?T y(t) node, the verb of
the relative clause can be parsed in the usual way, followed by the object noun. It is
instructive to note that in a subject relative clause, the verb does not carry the subject
agreement marker which is obligatory in other ﬁnite environments. This is reﬂected
in the analysis given here, where the subject node has already been decorated by the
demonstrative pronoun. A full DS analysis of Katcha verbs falls outwith the scope of
the current study, but it is plausible to suppose that the obligatory subject agreement
marker in a ﬁnite clause may be an ‘incorporated pronoun’ which decorates the logical
subject node and that the verb projects the predicate and (where appropriate) object
nodes. In the case of a relative clause an alternative pronoun, the demonstrative,
decorates the subject node. Parsing the verb and object of the relative clause then
gives the tree in (10.20).

on the intermediate nodes and providing a complete epsilon term to instantiate the
meta-variable and fulﬁl the requirement for a Formula value on the root node. This
brings about the tree in (10.16), which can be evaluated using the rule of Appositive
LINK Evaluation (10.9) to produce a single epsilon term with a conjoint restrictor
(ϵx , (Cow′ (x) ∧ Eat′ (ϵy , Grass′ (y))(x))) as the logical object of the matrix proposition.
   The analysis outlined here ultimately gives a result which models the Katcha
data very well. There are three salient features of demonstratives in Katcha which
were presented in chapter 5: ﬁrstly, demonstratives are pronouns; secondly, they
are appositional to the modiﬁed noun; thirdly, they ascribe deﬁniteness to the noun
phrase, there being no separate lexical category of determiners. The lexical actions
for the demonstrative proposed here project three nodes which are reﬂective of these
three respective features: a metavariable, a nominal variable identical to that of the
modiﬁed noun, and an epsilon binding operator. When these lexical actions interact
10.2. Subject Relatives                                                                      235with standard Dynamic Syntax rules such as LINK Apposition and standard epsilon
calculus semantics, the expected interpretation of subject relative clauses falls out quite
naturally.
      It should be noted that this account of subject relatives leads obligatorily to the
relativised noun phrase having an indeﬁnite interpretation. This might seem sur-
prising since the relativising particle is the demonstrative pronoun, which is usually
associated with a deﬁnite interpretation; somewhere along the way it appears that
the demonstrative has lost its ability to ascribe deﬁnitenesss to the noun it modiﬁes.
The explanation of this puzzle is in the incremental nature of Dynamic Syntax. DS
characterises pronouns as underspeciﬁed metavariables which are subsequently updated.
The deﬁniteness of a pronoun does not come from the pronoun itself, but from the term
which later instantiates the metavariable. The fact that there is a unique, identiﬁable
referent for a noun phrase is a matter of pragmatics, not lexicon. As a case in point,
so-called deﬁnite determiners like the in English are frequently used in non-deﬁnite
contexts, such as generic expressions.
      In the case of a Katcha demonstrative noun phrase like fɪjɔ mɔ́, ‘this cow’, in (10.1),
the demonstrative pronoun does ascribe deﬁniteness to the phrase. This is because
the metavariable is resolved by Substitution and the context will supply a deﬁnite,
identiﬁable referent. The demonstrative pronoun, by its anaphoric nature, provides
an opening for a deﬁnite referent for the noun phrase; the ϵ-operator projected by the
demonstrative is supplemented by the ι-operator provided by the substituend. The
demonstrative pronoun thereby causes the noun phrase to be deﬁnite. In the case
of a relative clause, the metavariable is not resolved by Substitution, but instead
is resolved when the tree is compiled following the parsing of the verb (and any
complements). There is no opportunity for any further update to the binding operator
and consequently that node remains decorated with an ϵ-binder and the noun phrase
remains indeﬁnite.
      The prediction that relativised nouns in Katcha can only be indeﬁnite has a nice
consequence, in that it explains the second instance of the demonstrative pronoun
at the end of the relative clause. In my data, this clause-ﬁnal pronoun is present
quite consistently but previous researchers have not found this to be the case. Gilley
(2013:502) suggests that it is obligatory for masculine, optional for feminine and absent
for plural nouns, though she does not attempt to give any further analysis. Stevenson
(1956-57:61,63), however, ﬁnds that the clause-ﬁnal demonstrative is optional and states
that its purpose is to mark deﬁniteness. The analysis given here predicts Stevenson’s
data to be correct.7
      Assuming that the clause-ﬁnal demonstrative is there to make the noun phrase
  7
    I generally ﬁnd Stevenson’s descriptions to be quite accurate, so this should come as no major
surprise.

Starting from the point in the parse when all words except for the ﬁnal demonstrative

tive are carried out. Naturally, these are the same steps described above: Appositive

7.5 Conclusion
In section 7.1 it was noted following Hyman (2007) that verb extensions in African
languages may have one of four basic functions, listed in (7.39).(7.39) a. increase valence
          b. decrease valence
          c. (re-)orient action
          d. mark aspectOf these four functions, the ﬁrst two primarily aﬀect the arguments of a proposition
while the latter two primarily aﬀect the predicate. That is, (a-b) primarily aﬀect

former type, licensing the presence or absence of arguments.
   There are various morphemes related to argument structure which are potential
candidates for being classed as verb extensions. Of these, reﬂexives and reciprocals are
not encoded using verb extensions; Katcha uses a more analytic construction with a
noun or pronoun expressing the reﬂexive or reciprocal object.
   The applicative is the only one of the Katcha verb extensions to increase valency.
This makes it something of a special case. However, it is also something of a special
case in that it is not typical of applicative constructions typologically. There is no al-
ternative non-applicative construction with the same truth-conditional meaning. Also,
the additional argument it licenses is marked with the dative preposition a rather than
being a direct object, so in one sense this morpheme does not increase valency. Rather,
it introduces an oblique argument and so acts somewhat like a preposition. A Dynamic
Syntax theoretical analysis modelling applicatives from this point of view is given in
chapter 9.
   If the ‘applicative’ does not in fact increase valency, then we can revise the statement
at the beginning of this section to say that all Katcha verb extensions decrease valency;
the function of all of them is to license the absence of a syntactic argument. This is
not surprising given that it was noted in section 7.2 that Katcha verbs are inherently
transitive. If it is semantically plausible for a verb to be transitive, this is always
the basic form. Most of these VEs decrease semantic valency in addition to syntactic
valency, presenting the event described by the verb as having only one participant
(though this is not the case for the passive). As shown in table 7.1, Katcha has a
complete paradigm of valency decreasing verb extensions. A theoretical analysis within
the framework of Dynamic Syntax is given for these verb extensions in chapter 8. This
range of VEs allows Katcha to use inherently transitive verbs to present an event as
involving either one or two participants, and to take either the semantic agent or the
semantic patient as subject, thereby providing alternative perspectives on the situation
expressed.

In chapter 7, it was noted that the majority of verb extensions in Katcha are detransi-
tivising and that these valency-reducing VEs can be classiﬁed according to two features,
namely the thematic role played by the syntactic subject and the number of arguments
expressed. This classiﬁcation is summarised in table 7.1, repeated here as table 8.1.","[164, 165, 166, 167, 168]"

8.6 Conclusion
This chapter has outlined an analysis of valency-reducing verb extensions in Katcha,
making use of the Dynamic Syntax construal of terms as expressions of the epsilon
calculus. The inherent internal structure of epsilon terms allows a straightforward way
to incorporate context dependence into the account. An epsilon term represents an
arbitrary witness of some predicate and we can straightforwardly deﬁne this predicate
as being dependent on the immediate context. Thus it is straightforward to deﬁne
structures such as ‘Kuku is laughing (at whatever it is that Kuku is laughing at in this
instance)’ or ‘Drums are beaten (by whatever it is that beats drums)’.
       In terms of the Katcha data, the approach outlined here allows us to neatly capture
the diﬀerence between (for example) an antipassive verb and a transitive verb with no
overt object. A transitive verb decorates its logical object node with a metavariable: a
term whose content is underspeciﬁed and requires subsequent update. In the case of
a transitive verb without an overt object, this update will come from context. In the
case of the antipassive, the update comes from the suﬃx, which supplies a contextually
deﬁned epsilon term. The same is true for the other suﬃxes which reduce semantic
valency, unaccusative and middle voice. Although the denotational content of the
epsilon term is minimal, it decorates the object node and so prevents it from being
instantiated from context by something with more substantive content. Thus ‘Kuku
is laughing’ is semantically diﬀerent to ‘Kuku is laughing at something’, despite the
same inherently transitive verb and an equally indeterminate ‘object’ being used in
both cases.12
       The semantic diﬀerence between a transitive verb with an unspeciﬁed object and a
verb of reduced valency is not restricted to Katcha, nor to languages with morphological
antipassives. Fodor and Fodor (1980) note in regard to scope eﬀects that the same is
  12
    The analysis as it currently stands has antipassives denoting some arbitrary patient, while the
pro-dropped object of a transitive verb must have a referential interpretation. It may be that this is
too strong. Intuitively, one might expect a transitive verb with no object to have the interpretation
I have ascribed to antipassives (there is some patient but we do not know or care what it is), and
for antipassives to be genuinely intransitive. Determining whether this is the case will require further
empirical study on the referentiality of pro-dropped arguments.
8.6. Conclusion                                                                       179true for detransitivized verbs in English; there are important semantic distinctions to be
made between between ‘Everyone was reading’ and ‘Everyone was reading something’.
Steedman (2011, 2015) provides an analysis of such detransitivized English sentences
in which he construes the implied objects as Skolem terms. There are clear parallels
between Steedman’s analysis and the one given here insofar as both construe a ‘miss-
ing’ argument as being represented by an arbitrary semantic object with properties
dependent on context. The Dynamic Syntax use of epsilon terms though is arguably
more transparent in that an epsilon term speciﬁes its properties within the proposition
that forms its restrictor. As shown above, it is quite straightforward to deﬁne lexical
actions which specify the properties of the restrictor and thereby use this formalism to
model highly context-dependent semantic objects.
Chapter 9Adjuncts, Prepositions and CaseIntroduction
The purpose of this chapter is to outline a Dynamic Syntax approach to prepositional
phrases. To date, the only serious attempt at analysing prepositional phrases within
Dynamic Syntax is that of Marten (2002), who treats them as optional arguments of
the main predicate. This chapter proposes an alternative which construes prepositional
phrases as adjuncts, an approach which more closely reﬂects the observations of Lakoﬀ
and Ross (1976) that most prepositional phrases are adverbial and situated outside the
verb phrase. A prepositional phrase constructs semantic structure which is separate
from the main propositional tree but connected to the node it modiﬁes by means of
a LINK relation. The analysis is developed by applying it not only to prepositional
phrases, but also to other relevant constructions in the Katcha data.
   Section 9.1 demonstrates how this approach applies to prepositional phrases which
have an intersective, or adjectival, interpretation. These are prepositional phrases which
modify a term. This term may be an individual but is more commonly an event (again,
this is in line with the observations of Lakoﬀ and Ross (1976)). The prepositional
phrases are construed as building a LINKed propositional tree that provides extra
information about some argument in the matrix proposition. As such they are similar
to relative clauses, and use the same technical apparatus as standard DS treatments
of relatives. The formal details of the process are reﬁned slightly in section 9.2 in
order to handle the recursive locative prepositional phrases described in section 6.4.
This reﬁnement makes use only of DS tools that have been proposed independently for
other constructions in other languages.
   Given that the approach adopted here is to treat prepositional phrases as adjuncts, it
should apply equally as well to adverbs. This is taken up in section 9.3, with a discussion
of prepositional phrases which modify predicates and which therefore have a subsective,
or adverbial, interpretation. They are construed as building a LINKed tree providing
                                           181
182                              Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Caseextra information about some predicate in the matrix proposition. Section 9.4 then
extends this to locative adverbs. These words have been described by some authors as
postpositions, but it was argued in section 6.4 that they are in fact adverbs. Locative
adverbs are easily dealt with under an analysis that construes them as modifying a
predicate projected by the locative preposition, thus bringing together the analyses of
the two types of modiﬁcation.
   The ﬁnal two sections of the chapter apply the analysis to two constructions related
to prepositional phrases. Section 9.5 discusses applicatives, arguing that these may
be treated much like prepositions, the only real diﬀerence being that the applicative
morpheme does not form a syntactic constituent with its complement. Section 9.6 then
goes on to look at case. The DS construal of case as a ﬁlter on well-formed structure is
discussed with respect to the analysis of prepositional phrases developed here and it is
suggested that this may shed light on indirect and applied objects, topicalised subjects
and the form of personal pronouns in Katcha.","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"

9.4 Locative adverbs(9.23) ak-oɗo           ak-atáɗá               k-été     kɪ ́ʈá

adverbs rather than as prepositional phrases headed by ka. It is now possible to expand
upon this distinction. A prepositional phrase like kete in (9.1) modiﬁes a term (even
when that term is an event) and might therefore be described as adjectival. On the
other hand, a prepositional phrase like a kʊɓɓʊ in (9.15) modiﬁes a predicate and might
therefore be described as adverbial. Analysing words such as kɪʈa as locative adverbs
suggests that they should be analysed in the same way as adverbial prepositional
phrases, that is, as type (e → t) → (e → t) predicates. It was also noted in chapter
6 that these adverbs add detail to the location provided by the locative prepositional
198                             Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casephrase; in other words, they modify the prepositional phrase. Since the prepositional
phrase projects a proposition whose predicate is a locative relation, it is straightforward
to analyse the adverb as modifying this predicate.
   Under this analysis, the processing of sentence (9.23) will proceed in the following
manner (ignoring the initial verb akoɗo for conciseness). As with all intransitive verbs,
ataɗa , ‘stand’, projects a full propositional template, of type e → (es → t) including a
metavariable decorating the logical subject node and a term decorating the event node.
In the case of (9.23), the verb is in an imperative form. The imperative does two things:
ﬁrstly, it speciﬁes the addressee as the logical subject of the proposition; secondly, it
adds extra information marking the fact that the speaker desires the addressee to bring
about the event expressed by the proposition. Exactly how this is achieved formally is
not relevant to the current discussion, so I for now it is simply indicated by a +IMP
imperative marker on the propositional root node and the proposition is otherwise
treated as if it were declarative. I also assume that having parsed akataɗa, the logical
subject is correctly identiﬁed with the addressee (in this case, the group of boys):(9.24) Parsing akataꞌda                                      ?T y(t), +IMP                     F o(si ), T y(es ), ♢           ?T y(es → t)
                                             F o(boys′ ),      F o(stand′ ),
                                                T y(e)      T y(e → (es → t))
   With the pointer on the event argument, the prepositional phrase kete, ‘loc-me’
can be parsed, decorating a LINKed propositional tree just as in sections 9.1-9.2 above.

9.1 Event-modifying prepositional phrases(9.1) aːfʊ́ ʊ́rʊ́néːné k-ete     k-ɔːna
       ants 3m.crawl loc-1sg loc-body
       ‘ants are crawling on my body’   In a sentence like (9.1), it is not necessarily obvious whether the locative phrase kete
kɔːna describes the location of the ants or the location of the event of their crawling. In
other words, this phrase might be thought of as modifying an individual or it might be
thought of as modiﬁying an event. From a formal point of view, this distinction does
not matter a great deal since both individuals and events project type e terms. A phrase
such as on my body can be thought of as supplying an additional proposition which is
‘intersective’ in that it shares an argument with the matrix proposition. Whether the
shared argument is an event term or an individual term does not make much diﬀerence
to the process of building the propositional tree.
    In Dynamic Syntax, the formal tool used for modelling the connection between
propositions is the LINK relation. A LINK is the relation that holds between two
semantic trees which share some content. It is generally interpreted as a conjunction of
the values of the LINKed nodes. In the case of event-modifying prepositional phrases,
the LINK will hold between the situation argument of the matrix tree and the root
node of a LINKed tree that expresses an additional proposition about that situation.
This formal apparatus, a proposition LINKed to a term, is standardly used in DS
to model relative clauses. This is hardly surprising, given that a relative clause also
represents an additional proposition about some argument of the matrix proposition.
A PP adjunct modifying an argument is essentially a ‘small’ relative clause. To see how

an interpretation where the prepositional phrase modiﬁes the event (though as noted
above, the implementation works in much the same way for an analysis in which the
PP modiﬁes the subject argument).
       The processing of (9.1) begins with the parsing of the sentential subject and verb,
the lexical actions of the verb leaving the pointer on the situation argument node as in

       The string aːfʊ ʊrʊneːne forms a fully grammatical sentence; if there were no
additional lexical material, the pointer would move to the logical subject node to resolve
the metavariable by unification with the unﬁxed node and the tree could compile
to give a fully speciﬁed proposition. But with the pointer at the event argument
node, there is nothing to stop this node being developed further. This can be done
using the computational action of LINK Introduction (Kempson et al. 2001:113;
Cann et al. 2005:88). This rule constructs a LINK relation from a type e node to
an open propositional node (a node with a requirement for type t). It also adds a
modal requirement ?⟨↓∗ ⟩(F o(si ), T y(es )), which requires that somewhere below (i.e. in
the LINKed tree) should be a copy of the node at the head of the LINK (9.3).
   1
      The assumption that the lexical actions of the verb leave the pointer on the situation argument
node is an adjustment to the account given in chapter 8 where it was assumed that the lexical actions
of the verb left the pointer on the logical subject node. This does not aﬀect the analyses given there,
merely adding an additional step of pointer movement from the situation argument node to the logical
subject node.
    2
      Cann (In prep.) argues that, like other type e terms, event arguments should be construed as epsilon
terms. In the formulae given in this section the internal structure of terms, including event variables,
is suppressed for notational clarity. The interpretation of PP adjuncts given here is a non-restrictive
one and so does not need to make reference to the internal structure of the epsilon-term.

It checks that the pointer is at an open LINKed propositional node, that is, a node
which requires type t and is connected by a LINK to a completed type e node. The
actions then construct a predicate-argument structure, decorating the predicate node
with a two place locative relation (loc ′ ), decorating the external argument node with
a copy of the node at the head of the LINK (in this case, the situation variable si ), and
leaving the pointer on the open internal argument node. Executing these actions leads
to the partial tree in (9.5).","[201, 202, 203]"

6.6 Pronominal case
It has been argued throughout this chapter that the morphemes which specify oblique
argument roles in Katcha are better described as prepositions than as case markers.
This is on the basis that these oblique arguments do not generally have their form
assigned obligatorily by the verb. This is not the same for pronouns, the form of which
clearly is determined by some governing element, either the verb or a preposition. There
is therefore a strong argument for describing the forms of the pronouns as cases. This
is particularly true for the core pronouns where tone seems to play a role.
   As noted in section 6.1.1, it may be that the case of the core pronouns is marked
by their tone melody. The use of tone to mark case is extremely rare in a global
perspective and arguably does not exist at all outwith Africa, but is common in eastern
Africa: ‘tone as a marker for case is the most salient feature of case behaviour in
Africa’ (König 2008:224). There are a couple of comments to be made regarding the
fact that Katcha may exhibit tonal case. One is a typological implication: the case
alignment is likely to be ‘marked-nominative’. Marked-nominative systems display the
same alignment as accusative case systems; that is, the subjects of both transitive
and intransitive clauses (the S and A arguments) are marked in the same way, while
the object of a transitive clause (the P argument) is treated diﬀerently. However, in
a prototypical marked-nominative language, the accusative form is functionally and
morphologically unmarked, acting as the default form, whilst the nominative form is
morphologically marked with its use restricted to the realisation of S and A arguments.
In that sense, marked-nominative systems are slightly reminiscent of ergative systems.
Like tonal case, marked-nominative systems are rare from a global perspective, but
‘constitute the most widespread type of case systems in Africa’ (König 2008:138). More
signiﬁcantly,     ‘there is a connection between case expressed by tone and the existence of
     a marked-nominative system… If case is expressed by tone then there is a
     marked-nominative system.’ (König 2008:198,224)Therefore it is to be expected that if Katcha has tonal case it will have a marked-
124                           Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and Prepositionsnominative alignment.9
       A further interesting observation is that within tonal case systems it is particularly
common for low tone to be the marker of Nominative case, which appears to be the
case in Katcha. This tendency appears to be a universal feature of both the Cushitic
(Afro-Asiatic) and Nilotic (Nilo-Saharan) families. There are other language families
with tonal case which use other tone patterns to mark Nominative, but in Cushitic
and Nilotic, ‘the nominative is always expressed by loss of a high tone, triggering a
low tone’ (König (2008:223), citing Tosco (1994)). In the context of the ongoing debate
about the genetic aﬃliation of the Kadu family, this is notable because Katcha nominals
share characteristics with both of these families. The tripartite number marking system
described in chapter 4 as being common in Nilo-Saharan is particularly prevalent in
Nilotic, and this is also one of the few branches of Nilo-Saharan with a masculine-
feminine gender system. Also in chapter 4, it was demonstrated that Katcha’s highly
unusual gender system is found in several Cushitic languages. So whether it is a genetic
or areal trait or a typological correlation, it seems that Katcha nominals do not only
share features of number and gender with Nilotic and Cushitic languages, but also case.
       It is important at this point to state the caveat that there remains a great deal
that is unclear about the tonal system of Katcha, and a good percentage of my textual
data originally comes from written sources which do not mark tone at all. As such,
conclusions about tonal behaviour should be treated as tentative. It is plausible that
the diﬀerences in tone melody on pronouns which have been ascribed to case may in
fact be conditioned by other factors, such as intonation or position in the sentence.
Nonetheless, given its geographical location, it would not be surprising to ﬁnd case
marked by tone in Katcha.
       If the tone variation on core pronouns is indeed a marker of the Nominative and
Accusative cases, it may be that the oblique form of the pronouns described in section
6.1.2 should also be thought of as a case, presumably ‘Oblique’ case. It is diﬀerent from
the tonal case exhibitied in core pronouns, however, in that it is not assigned by verbs
but by prepositions.
       Pronominal case can be summarised as follows. The verb assigns tonal case, which
I tentatively take to be Nominative and Accusative, to the core arguments. Peripheral
arguments are not generally marked by case, but by prepositions (though see section
9.6 for discussion of the status of dative a). These prepositions also assign case, either
Accusative (section 6.2.1), Oblique (section 6.2.2) or a mixture of both (section 6.2.3).
   9
    König (2008:198) suggests that this correlation is an absolute universal in the case of nouns, but
that with pronouns tonal marking may also be found in a few languages with accusative case alignment.
The question of whether Katcha nouns exhibit tonal case alternations remains open, pending a fuller
investigation of tone. It could be that case is only relevant to pronouns, in which case the possibility
exists that Katcha is one of the small number of exceptions with an accusative system realised by tone.
6.7. Conclusion                                                                                 1256.7 Conclusion
This chapter set out to describe the various forms of pronoun found in Katcha and to
explain the diﬀerences between them. Given the fact that the choice of pronominal
form is heavily dependent on the role it plays in the sentence and (in oblique cases)
which preposition it follows, an extended discussion of prepositions and similar mor-
phemes was necessary before it was tentatively concluded that these diﬀerent forms
are realisations of case. Core cases (Nominative and Accusative) are assigned by verbs,
while prepositions assign Accusative or Oblique case to their pronominal complements.
       The pronominal system once again reﬂects the importance in Katcha of the contrast
between the notions of ‘core’ and ‘peripheral’.10 There are two sets of pronouns, one of
which is used for the core arguments of subject and object while the other is used for
oblique arguments. For this reason, I have proposed referring to these sets of prononuns
as the core pronouns and the oblique pronouns respectively. Even if it is correct that
there is a distinction between the nominative and accusative cases, this still amounts
to a secondary diﬀerentiation within the category of core pronoun.
       When we look at the interaction between the pronouns and prepositions it becomes
clear that these contrasting notions of core and non-core apply in other areas of the
language, and not just to argument structure. There are three types of prepositions:
those which take core pronouns as complements, those which take oblique pronouns as
complements and those which take a combination. The third group, which includes the
great majority of prepositions, is perhaps the most interesting because of the nature
of the combination of pronouns. The relevant factor in this case is whether or not
the preposition’s complement is a speech act participant. In 1st and 2nd person,
i.e. the core speech act participants, these prepositions take core pronouns as their
complements. In the 3rd person, i.e. non-speech act participants, the oblique pronouns
are used. In this way, there is a morphologically realised connection between the
notion of core arguments with regard to sentencial predicate-argument structure and
the notion of core participants with regard to speech act participation. The fact that
the pronouns used for subject and object (vis a vis oblique arguments) are also used for
speaker and hearer (vis a vis non-participants) gives further support to the idea that
the main diﬀerence between the two sets of pronouns is that of ‘core’ vs ‘peripheral’.","[142, 143, 144]"

6.4.2 Additional prepositional phrases
When referring to body parts, Katcha uses a construction that looks very similar to
that used with locative adverbs (6.73-6.74). Indeed, because most locative adverbs
are derived from words for body parts, in some cases the lexical items are the same.
In (6.73), for example, the interpretation is ‘ants are crawling on my body’. As with
locative adverbs, the prepositional phrase gives a general location (‘on me’) which is
speciﬁed further by the subsequent prepositional phrase.(6.73) aːfʊ́ ʊ́rʊ́néːné k-ete          k-ɔːna
         ants 3m.crawl loc-1sg loc-body

   8
    Note that it is perfectly possible for ká to co-occur with ʊŋŋɔ when the context is locative: kʊŋŋɔ
ka murkaɓu ‘they were in a boat’ (MAT 4.21).
6.4. Modiﬁcation of locative phrases                                                  121An interesting question would be whether (6.73) is ambiguous between ‘ants are crawl-
ing on my body’ (kɔːna meaning ‘on body’) and ‘ants are crawling all over me’ (kɔːna
meaning ‘all over’). A possible answer to this question may come from looking at
the tone melody of the locative pronoun. Before locative adverbs the pronoun carries
the usual tone melody, as given in the paradigm in (6.23, repeated below). But in the
context of (6.73), the tone melody of the locative pronoun appears to be diﬀerent (6.75).
It is not certain why this is, but it is certainly possible that it serves to diﬀerentiate
sentences like (6.73) where the general locative is further speciﬁed by an additional
prepositional phrase from those where it is further speciﬁed by an adverb.(6.75) locative preposition ká + personal pronouns, before k-ɔːna, ‘loc-body’

          3f        kɔ́nɔ́   Having now looked at the locative preposition ká in some detail, it can be seen
that it is a very general locative. It can be thought of as an essentially underspeciﬁed
locative relation. Where the precise relation can be established from context through
general pragmatic principles, ka on its own is suﬃcient. Elsewhere it requires to be
further speciﬁed, and this may be done through the use of locative adverbs or (at least
in the case of body parts) an additional locative phrase. This underspeciﬁcation means
that the locative preposition may be used in a wide range of contexts and is one of the
reasons ká is so ubiquitous in Katcha.
122                       Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and Prepositions6.5 Lexical speciﬁcation of prepositions
In section 6.2 it was noted that the line between case markers and adpositions is very
ﬁne, and that one way of distinguishing between them is to consider the question of
whether or not the form used is ‘imposed by the structure within which the noun
phrase occurs’ (Payne 1997:100). If we adopt this as a rule of thumb, the question
of optionality becomes key. In the majority of examples cited in this chapter there is
no obligation for a noun phrase to be marked with a particular morpheme, thus the
characterisation of them as prepositions rather than case markers. The use of these
prepositions seems to be primarily down to communicative intent.
   There are nonetheless a few verbs which require their complements to be headed
by particular prepositions. An obvious example is the ditransitive verb anáŋá, ‘give’
whose indirect object is marked by dative a. It was also argued in section 6.3.1 that cɔ,
‘go’, requires an object marked by dative a. In addition to these, a few verbs require
their object to be marked with locative ká, even though there does not seem to be any
locative interpretation (6.76-6.78).(6.76) anʊ ‘refuse’

closer inspection the majority of these appear to be constructions where the complement

it ‘not always easy to distinguish whether a noun or a verb has been used.’ (Stevenson
1941:104) But a number of the verbs Stevenson lists, which take ka before an inﬁnitive,
seem not to take ka when the object is unambiguously a noun. In such cases, the ka is
better thought of not as a preposition, but as a dependent clause marker.
   Overall, it seems that there are very few verbs which lexically determine the form
their complements must take. As such, there does not seem to be suﬃcient evidence to
describe these morphemes as case markers.","[139, 140, 141, 142]"

5.6 Conclusion
There are, phonetically, ﬁve sets of morphemes marking nominal modiﬁers in Katcha,
namely j-/m-/n-, já/má/ná, já/mɔ́/nɔ́, ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and i ́nːi ̂/umːû. These serve various
functions, marking proximal, medial and distal demonstratives, possessives, subject
relative clauses and non-subject relative clauses. As implied by table 5.2, the correlation
between the surface phonetic form of the morpheme and its syntactic function is
not completely clear. To reduce this mix of forms and functions to something more
systematic is obviously desirable from the point of view of analytical elegance. However,
it is also desirable for data-driven reasons: with the exception of the medial and
distal demonstrative pronouns, there is considerable uniformity in the form of nominal
modiﬁers and an understanding of how they are related would shed considerable light
on the workings of the language.
     With regard to the similarities of form, it was argued in section 5.4.1 that there
is in fact only one ‘j/m/n-style’ morpheme, with the variant pronunciations due to
intonation-based allomorphy. This leaves three forms to give an analysis for: i ́nːi ̂/umːû,
ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and já/mɔ́/nɔ́. The ﬁrst two of these are uncontroversial, being the distal
and medial demonstrative pronouns respectively. The third includes the proximal
demonstrative pronoun, but is also used in all other nominal modiﬁers. One possible
analysis of the syntactic function of this latter morpheme is that it simply marks
modiﬁcation generally. However, this does not account for the fact that the medial
and distal demonstratives do not exhibit this marking, whereas the proximal demon-
strative, along with relative clauses and possessive noun phrases, does. In section
5.4.2 it was therefore argued that a better analysis is to assume that the three forms
já/mɔ́/nɔ́, ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and i ́nːi ̂/umːû represent the three demonstrative pronouns and that
other Katcha nominal modiﬁers are phrases headed by a demonstrative pronoun. All
modiﬁers stand in a relationship of apposition to the modiﬁed noun. This approach
allows a uniﬁed treatment of the various types of modiﬁer, including the medial and
distal demonstratives. It is supported by the fact that there are no words in Katcha
5.6. Conclusion                                                                     93which can be unambiguously categorised as determiners or adjectives; lexical nouns
appear to form complete noun phrases which do not allow phrase-internal modiﬁcation.
Nominal modiﬁcation is therefore achieved by apposition of an external phrase.
   Finally, as noted in section 5.5, the analysis adopted here can be placed in a wider
context within African linguistics. The demonstrative which heads the appositional
modiﬁer shows gender agreement with the head noun, thereby encoding the function
of ‘Attribution’ and connecting the modiﬁer with the head. In this way it acts as
a relative marker of the type found in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages. A
prototypical relative marker is not a pronoun and indeed the demonstrative does not
show the subordinate clause case marking that would be expected of a relative pronoun.
Nonetheless, it was argued in section 5.4.2 that the demonstrative is best considered
to be a pronoun. So it is not a fully prototypical relative marker, though it may be
in process of being grammaticalized as such. Similarly, the possessive construction in
Katcha does not alter the form of the head noun and therefore is not quite an example
of the construct state found in many African languages, but it does represent the
kind of structure from which such a phenomenon could develop. Construing nominal
modiﬁers as appositional phrases headed by a demonstrative pronoun not only provides
a uniﬁed analysis of the Katcha data, but also gives an example of one way in which
two seemingly unrelated, typically African constructions might derive from a common
source.
Chapter 6Pronouns and PrepositionsIntroduction
This chapter presents a description of personal pronouns in Katcha and aims to explain
the diﬀerences between the various forms. There are two basic sets of pronominal
forms, which I label ‘Core’ pronouns and ‘Oblique’ pronouns, and these are described
in section 6.1. The choice of pronominal form is dependent on the role it plays in
the sentence and also, in oblique cases, which preposition it follows. A description
of prepositions and similar morphemes, incuding the pronominal forms they select, is
therefore presented in sections 6.2 and 6.3. The following two sections discuss other
aspects of the prepositional system, namely the modiﬁcation of (primarily locative)
prepositional phrases by adverbs or further prepositional phrases (section 6.4) and the
lexical selection of prepositions by certain verbs (section 6.5). The chapter concludes
by returning to the discussion of pronominal forms in section 6.6, where it is suggested
that these diﬀerent forms may be best described as realisations of case. Taking into
account evidence from tone alternations and typological universals, it is tentatively
concluded that Katcha personal pronouns occur in one of three three cases: Nominative,
Accusative and Oblique.","[111, 112, 113, 114]"
"2.3.3 MorphosyntaxKatchaThe only recently published work in Katcha morphosyntax is Gilley (2013). This is a
comprehensive study of number-marking in Katcha nouns and is discussed in chapter
4. One other paper which has been made somewhat more widely available is Waag
(2012), an (as yet unpublished) conference presentation on Katcha pronouns and case-
marking/prepositions which is discussed in chapter 6.
   Other than these two papers there is a limited amount of work on Katcha mor-
phosyntax that has been done more recently in Khartoum, mainly in the context of
20                                                                Preliminaries: Backgroundliteracy and language development projects. This primarily consists of write-ups from
linguistic workshops held with Katcha speakers in Khartoum between 2006 and 2009,
plus transcriptions of several narrative texts recorded in the home area.2Other Kadu languagesMore published data does exist in a few of the other Kadu languages, though none have
been studied by more than a couple of scholars. Given that these languages are quite
closely related to Katcha, there are insights to be gained from the ﬁndings of these
researchers.
      The most extensively documented of the Kadu languages is Krongo. This is the
only language in the family for which a full-length grammar description exists, namely
Reh (1985). In addition to this monograph, Reh (1983) summarises in English some
of her typologically interesting ﬁndings. An alternative analysis of some of the data is
found in Dimmendaal’s (1987) review.
      As well as her larger work on Krongo, Reh has produced a grammar sketch of Keiga,
published as Reh (1994).
      Krongo and Keiga, then, are arguably the best documented of the Kadu languages.
Unfortunately, they are also the most distantly related from Katcha, as per the group-
ings given in Table 2.1. The only language from Stevenson’s ‘central’ grouping for which
data has been published is Kadugli, with two published works: Abdalla (1969) and
Matsushita (1984, 1986). The former has the distinction of being the ﬁrst attempt at
theoretical linguistic analysis of any of the Kadu languages. Unfortunately, this renders
it somewhat dated; written from the standpoint of early Transformational Grammar,
the majority of the content is given to the formulation of transformation rules. It is
therefore less useful to the present enterprise than might have been hoped. Matsushita’s
work is based around vocabulary: after giving an overview of both nominal and verbal
morphology, the majority of the articles are taken up by the provision of an extensive
word list.
      More recent, though unpublished, material on a ‘central’ Kadu language can be
found in Sukkar (2014), a conference presentation on verbal morphology in Miri, which
summarizes her MA dissertation.

2.4. Fieldwork and other data sources                                                  212.4 Fieldwork and other data sources
The current study is based on data from the sources discussed above, but also original
data collected through ﬁeldwork in Khartoum between November 2012 and May 2013.
During this time I worked with two members of the Katcha community in Khartoum.
Both were male, aged in their forties and speakers of the Tuna dialect of Katcha. Both
men were born and grew up in the language area, speaking Katcha as their mother
tongue and in most childhood contexts, though being educated in Arabic from the age
of eight. However both had moved to Khartoum at relatively young ages and had lived
in Khartoum for many years (24 years in one case, 36 years in the other). Within
Khartoum both are active within the expatriate Katcha community and continue to
speak Katcha at home and socially. One of the men works as a mechanic and therefore
speaks Arabic at work, but the other is employed as a mother tongue literacy worker
within the Katcha community and therefore teaches, reads and writes Katcha as well
as speaking it most of the time. In addition to Katcha, both men are ﬂuent in Sudanese
Arabic and have a reasonable level of English.
   My contact with Katcha speakers was largely limited to formal language sessions
with my two main contacts. The community were wary of foreigners coming to their
neighbourhood due to security concerns, so language sessions were conducted at my
house and I did not get much contact with the wider community. Once a week, I sat in
on a translation checking session with the Katcha Bible translation team (a further two
native speakers) and a translation consultant, though those sessions were conducted in
English.
   Language sessions, which happened once or twice per week, were a mixture of con-
trolled elicitation and text elicitation. In order to make the most of potentially limited
ﬁeldwork time, my controlled elicitation concentrated on morphosyntactic features of
the language, eg. agreement paradigms, rather than collecting vocabulary.
   The data presented in this study is representative of the morphosyntactic data
collected during ﬁeldwork. Audio recordings were made of the majority of it. A list
of about 130 nouns in both singular and plural forms was also collected. In addition,
three oral texts were recorded, transcribed and analysed using Fieldworks Language
Explorer (FLEx) to create a small database of lexical and functional morphemes.
   A further resource is the text of the draft Katcha New Testament. The translation
group have kindly granted me online reader access to their unpublished draft. The
draft is currently under revision, which means it has a tendency to change, and it is
translated material so may not necessarily always be in traditional Katcha cultural or
literary style, but it nonetheless represents a substantial corpus of textual data and
has proven a very helpful source of syntactic examples. An associated resource is the
list of verbs found in the text which is maintined by the translation consultant. This
22                                                             Preliminaries: Backgroundcurrently lists approximately 470 verbs.
     It should be noted that of these various sources of Katcha data, the vast majority
are written only. In particular the two largest sources, Stevenson’s (1941) grammar and
the draft Katcha New Testament are written with no tone and with some inconsistency
with regard to the balance between phonetic detail and morphophonemic consistency.
(More details are given on these matters in chapter 3.) Throughout this thesis I have
therefore tried to use my own data where possible and use examples from the Bible or
Stevenson’s data only sparingly, or to provide extra discussion for speciﬁc hypotheses.","[38, 39, 40, 41]"

more complicated than those of proper nouns, providing both the semantic content of
the predicate and a template of the proposition’s argument structure. A lexical entry
for abʊ is given in (8.6).2 When the string /abʊ/ is encountered, the parser checks
whether the node currently under development is a propositional node, i.e. whether
there is a ?T y(t) requirement on the node. If so, it constructs and decorates a partial
tree according to the steps listed in (8.6) where ⟨↓1 ⟩ indicates a functor daughter and
⟨↓0 ⟩ indicates an argument daughter. For example, the ﬁrst line of this set of actions
constructs a functor daughter below the node where the pointer is currently located,
then moves the pointer to that node and decorates it with a requirement for a formula of
type e → t (i.e. a one-place predicate). The second and third lines then build a further
functor daughter node and decorate it with the semantic content λx.λy.Beat′ (x)(y), (a
type e → (e → t) predicate), and so on.","[171, 172]"

demonstrative this update comes from context; in the case of the relative clause it comes
from parsing the immediately following predicate, which can be done straightforwardly
since the trigger for parsing a predicate is an open ?T y(t) node. However, in the case of
a possessive noun phrase, such as that given in (10.24), the demonstrative pronoun is
followed by a noun phrase referring to the possessor. At ﬁrst glance, this would appear
to be problematic: other than the node decorated by a metavariable, the only node
available to be developed is the open ?T y(t) node. This is the usual context for parsing
a predicate, but there are no predicates to be parsed within the modiﬁer.
   A solution to this apparent problem is to assume with Kempson et al. (2001) that
possession is a relation between two individuals and that as such, it entails some
contextually deﬁned predicate. In Kempson et al. (2001)’s account of the English
genitive, this predicate is projected by the genitive case-marker ’s. In Katcha, there
is no morpheme marking possession because the ‘possessive’ marker is in fact the
demonstrative pronoun. The possessive predicate cannot therefore be projected by
this morpheme. Instead, the modifying noun is known to be a possessor because it
appears in a particular context, namely, immediately following the demonstrative. In
other words, possession in Katcha is not marked morphologically, but by syntactic
position.
   Formalising this construction is then a case of formalising the observation that when
a noun occurs in the correct syntactic context — following a demonstrative pronoun —
it has a possessive interpretation. This can easily be done by giving nouns a disjunctive
lexical entry, one of the disjuncts being actions to construct a predicate of possession
given the appropriate trigger. It is then simply a matter of deﬁning this trigger formally.
(10.26) gives one possible formulation of the lexical entry for the name Kuku. The ﬁrst
disjunct is a standard set of lexical actions for parsing a noun in an ordinary argument
context. The second disjunct is the one relevant to the current discussion. This states
that in the correct context (to be discussed below), an argument node is constructed
and decorated with the semantic content usually associated with the noun, but that,
in addition, a predicate node is constructed and decorated with a possession relation.
Ultimately this predicate will express the relationship between the referent of the noun
and the variable previously projected by the demonstrative.

requires to be speciﬁc enough that a noun will only be interpreted as a possessor

context and would overgenerate. It may be that the context described in (10.26) is
still too general and requires to be adjusted, perhaps by making reference to the LINK
relation. However, the exact formulation of the trigger does not aﬀect the overall
analysis. The important thing is that in the correct context, following the parsing
of a demonstrative pronoun as part of a nominal modiﬁer, the lexical actions of a
noun indicate its interpretation as possessor by constructing the appropriate predicate.
For now I assume that ?T y(t), ⟨↑0 ⟩T y(e) is a suﬃcient description of the context in
which these actions are executed. This context reﬂects the fact that the demonstrative
pronoun has already been parsed and has decorated the root node of the LINKed
epsilon-tree with a type e metavariable.
   The lexical actions deﬁned in (10.26) make the parsing of sentence (10.24) quite
straightforward. After the demonstrative has been parsed, the partial semantic tree
is as in (10.25). As was the case for relative clauses, the pointer will move down the
tree to develop the open ?T y(t) node. The noun may now be parsed with the context
ensuring that the possessive set of actions are executed, leading to the tree in (10.27).

et al. (2001) describe it as a semantically relatively weak predicate, a ‘relation whose
value is constructed from some contextually provided value’ (Kempson et al. 2001:145).
The case they consider is the English genitive and so they consider the predicate to be
a binary relation with the possessor as its logical subject and the possessee as its logical
object. For simplicity, they represent the predicate as P OSS. In the Katcha case, the
logical subject of this possession relation is the variable representing the possessee which
10.3. Possessive NPs                                                                                245is projected by the demonstrative pronoun. The relation is therefore the inverse of that
suggested by Kempson et al. (2001), and for convenience is written here as P OSSD to
make the diﬀerence explicit. (It can be thought of as ‘x is possessed by y’.) At ﬁrst this
seems like a slightly clumsy approach — hypothesising an implict predicate which may
be construed one way in one language but exactly inversely in another — but there
are two points to be made in its defence. One is that if the value of the predicate is
contextually provided, it might well be expected to vary from language to language.
The second point is that this diﬀerence is not unmotivated, but in fact reﬂects the
morphology of the two languages rather neatly. English possessives are constructed
using a dependent-marking strategy, that is, with morphological marking (‘genitive
case’) on the modifying noun (the possessor). Contrastingly, Katcha possessives are
head-marking8 and are expressed using something much closer to a construct state,
as was noted in section 5.5.2. The Katcha ‘possessive marker’, ie. the demonstrative
pronoun, does not morphologically mark the head noun (the possessee), but it is
associated with it by agreement and anaphorically. So the apparent diﬀerence between
the two languages in the semantics of the possession predicate may in fact be exactly
what we should expect to see, given their contrasting marking strategies for possessives.
If so, far from being clumsy, this is a very nice result. The analysis of the demonstrative
pronoun given in section 10.2 is that it shares an argument variable with the noun it
modiﬁes. This analysis was motivated by the need to account for relative clauses. But
a side eﬀect of that analysis is that in the case of possessives the logical subject of the
possession predicate must be the shared variable, forcing the possession predicate to
be P OSSD rather than P OSS. This directly reﬂects the morphology of possessive
constructions, because Katcha uses (something close to) a head-marking construct
strategy rather than a dependant-marking genitive strategy.9
   8
     Or at least, ‘head-aligned’, through agreement relations.
   9
     Although positing two alternative possession predicates reﬂects the morphology of possessive
constructions quite neatly, it is not obvious that such a distinction should exist in the semantics.
Assuming that the genitive construction in English and the possessive construction in Katcha express
the same semantic relation, it should perhaps be expected that there would be only one ‘P OSS-type’
relation. If so, the analysis given here forces this predicate to be expressed as the Katcha version with
the head, the possessee, as the external argument, rather than the inverse. Kempson et al. (2001)
make no strong claims for their assumed P OSS relation, describing it only as a relation whose value
is contextually provided, holding between the possessor and the possessee. Likewise, I do not wish to
make any strong claims about this predicate other than to suggest that if there is indeed only one such
relation, it is better to think of it as a property of the head noun, i.e. some relation holding between
the head noun and some modiﬁer.

          ‘The hen which Kuku sees is eating sesame’   Non-subject relatives are formed in the same way as subject relatives, the subor-
dinate clause being introduced by a demonstrative pronoun and also being concluded
with one (probably to mark deﬁniteness). However, the internal structure of the relative
clause is diﬀerent – a non-ﬁnite verb is used, being marked with a dependent clause
marker (and sometimes an inﬁnitive). A resumptive pronoun marking the relativised
element is also common; this does not occur in the case of subject relatives.
   A fully worked-out analysis of the internal structure of non-subject relative clauses
will be dependent on an analysis of the dependent clause marker ka and the discourse
properties of non-ﬁnite clauses, which is outwith the scope of the current study. How-
ever, it is possible to note a few points about how non-subject relative clauses may ﬁt
into the overall account of nominal modiﬁers.
   On the basis of the analysis presented so far, it is obvious why non-subject positions
cannot be relativised. The lexical actions of the demonstrative pronoun, as deﬁned in
(10.17), construct the partial epsilon tree in (10.18), repeated here as (10.30).","[259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265]"

phrases outlined here.    The ﬁrst is that there is nothing to specify possession in
the implementation, which reﬂects the fact that there are no morphemes indicating
possession in the Katcha construction (or indeed, in the parallel English construction
punched me on the nose). Nonetheless, a possessive interpretation is ensured by the
fact that the propositions projected by the two prepositional phrases are construed as
conjuncts which share an argument. In other words, they express properties of the same
event; the event of ants crawling on Musa is identiﬁed with the event of ants crawling on
a body. So for the overall proposition to be semantically and pragmatically coherent,
the body must be Musa’s.
   The second observation is that in using the rule of LINK-COPY Introduction
to initiate the construction of sub-trees, some of the burden for introducing semantic
9.3. Predicate-modifying prepositional phrases                                        193content into the LINKed tree is moved from the lexicon to the computational system.
This is not a move to be made lightly because Dynamic Syntax takes an explicitly
lexicalist view of grammar: computational actions are in principle general, optional
and universally available across languages; it is to be expected that any idiosyncratic
features of a language will be found in the lexicon.         For this reason, the LINK-
COPY Introduction rule for English, which is described as ‘language-idiosyncratic’
by Kempson et al. (2001:117), is abandoned in Cann et al. (2005:114) and replaced with
a lexical entry for a phonologically null relative complementizer. This is not an ideal
solution either because Dynamic Syntax does not generally invoke silent morphemes or
empty categories; any actions that cannot be ascribed to the lexical entry of a particular
morpheme (or type of morpheme) would be expected to reside in the computational
system. English bare relatives therefore pose something of a challenge to DS. They
are relatively easy to account for, either by computational rule or by lexical entry, but
both solutions are somewhat stipulative.
   In this context, the fact that Katcha prepositional phrases can be analysed as
making use of the same rule as English bare relatives suggests that perhaps this rule
is not as idiosyncratic as previously thought. It certainly lends plausibility to the
suggestion that the computational system may be the right place to put this kind
of anaphoric, term-expanding action after all. If computational rules are genuinely
optional, the possibility must be left open that there may be some rules which are used
only rarely. It is true that a rule found to be used in only one language would be
suspicious, but rather than being limited to English bare relatives, the LINK-COPY
action is also required for recursive prepositional phrases in Katcha - thus it has been
independently motivated for two diﬀerent constructions in two diﬀerent languages.","[208, 209, 210, 211, 212]"

                                      T y(e → (e → t))   This revised account treats applicatives essentially as prepositions. This idea is
supported by the semantic equivalence that often exists between adpositions and ap-
plicatives and also by the fact that from the point of view of grammaticalization, adpo-
sitions are one of the primary sources for applicative morphemes (Peterson 2006:125-
129). Since there is a synchronic and diachronic connection between prepositions and
applicatives, it should not be surprising to ﬁnd that they are analysed in almost the
same way as one another. The major diﬀerence between the two constructions is that
the complement of an adposition is collocated with it in the string forming what would

an applicative, the applied object, may be separated from it.
   There are then two possible ways of analysing applicatives. The analytic approach
has a slight semantic advantage: it expresses the semantic role of the applied object by
projecting an additional predicate to related the applied object to the main proposition.
In Katcha there is only one possible role, benefactive, but other languages may have
more than one applicative morpheme assigning diﬀerent roles. The analytic analysis
as laid out here also captures the similarity in function between applicatives and
prepositions. The lexical approach has a slight empirical advantage: in Katcha there
are phonological indications that applicative verbs are more likely to be lexicalised than
verbs with other extensions.
   It has been mentioned more than once that the Katcha applicative is somewhat
atypical. One of the ways this is true is the presence of the a marker before the
benefactive argument. If we adopt the analytic analysis of applicatives, where the
lexical actions of the applicative are essentially equivalent to those of an adposition,
the implication is that a is not a preposition. Rather its role is presumably simply
to mark which noun phrase is the applied object; in other words, it is a case marker.
Alternatively, if we adopt the lexical analysis, the benefactive argument is an argument
of the verb and so once again a must be a case marker. As noted above, the indirect
object of a ditransitive verb is also marked with a, which also supports the idea that a
is a case marker that does not supply any substantive semantic content. A discussion
of case is the focus of the next section.","[229, 230]"
"11.1.1 Number and gender
Nominal morphology and classiﬁcation interact in Katcha in ways which reﬂect ongoing
questions over the genetic aﬃliation of the Kadu languages.
   The morphology of nouns is based on number. The tripartite system of plurative,
singulative and replacive number marking is very reminiscent of that found in some
Nilo-Saharan (particularly Nilotic) languages. Within the replacive nouns there is
some evidence that the morphology may indicate semantic groupings of nouns. In
this respect, the nominal morphology is reminiscent of the Niger-Congo noun classes
of Katcha’s Kordofanian neighbours. For nouns that are morphologically marked for
number, gender classiﬁcation is a property of the number aﬃx, not the root noun. This
may mean that the gender of a semantically singular noun diﬀers from its gender when
semantically plural, something which is associated with Afro-Asiatic languages.
   Katcha has three gender classes, which can be described as being based around the
semantic notions of masculine, feminine and plural. The notion of plural as a value of
the gender feature is controversial but it has been posited for a number of languages
within the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.
   The complex interaction between the categories of number and gender in Katcha
is interesting in its own right. But it is particularly interesting in the context of the
question of the genetic lineage of the Kadu languages, which have been ascribed to
both the Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo families by various scholars. In fact, Katcha
nominal morphology and classiﬁcation shows notable characteristics not only of both
of these, but also of the third major language phyla in the region, Afro-Asiatic. The
gender system is particularly notable in that it appears to include plural as one of its
values. This is typologically highly unusual, having only previously been recorded in
the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.
11.2. Theoretical ﬁndings                                                            25311.1.2 Nominal Modiﬁers
In chapter 5 it was argued that Katcha nominal modiﬁers are appositional phrases
headed by a demonstrative pronoun. This approach allows a uniﬁed treatment of the
various types of modiﬁer, including the medial and distal demonstratives which are of
a diﬀerent form to all other modiﬁers. It is supported by the fact that there are no
words in Katcha which can be unambiguously categorised as determiners or adjectives;
lexical nouns appear to form complete noun phrases which do not allow phrase-internal
modiﬁcation. Nominal modiﬁcation is therefore achieved by apposition of an external
phrase.
   This is a somewhat unorthodox proposal but in fact it ﬁts closely, though not
exactly, with analyses of nominal modiﬁers which have been argued to be typologi-
cally typical in the African context. The demonstrative which heads the appositional
modiﬁer shows gender agreement with the head noun, thereby encoding the function of
‘Attribution’ and connecting the modiﬁer with the head. In this way it acts as a relative
marker of the type found in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages. Relative markers
are not prototypically pronouns so the demonstrative is not a fully prototypical relative
marker, though it may be in process of being grammaticalized as such. Similarly, the
possessive construction in Katcha does not alter the form of the head noun and therefore
is not a prototypical example of the construct state found in many African languages,
but it does represent the kind of structure from which such a phenomenon could develop.
   Construing nominal modiﬁers as appositional phrases headed by a demonstrative
pronoun not only provides a uniﬁed analysis of the Katcha data, but also gives an exam-
ple of one way in which two seemingly unrelated, but typically African, constructions
might derive from a common source.","[271, 272]"

three genders and that semantic number is not relevant to agreement. This conclusion
concurs with the ﬁndings of a number of previous researchers on Kadu languages. Reh,
for example, describes Krongo as having ‘weitgehend numerus-insensitiven Genera’

Number’ (Tucker and Bryan 1966:304). However, as noted above, other writers have
taken gender in Katcha to be a system of two gender classes, plus plural agreement
(Waag 2012) or have been non-committal in whether the third class marks neuter gender
or plural number (Gilley 2013). The source of this confusion lies in the fact that Katcha
nouns display a complex interaction between number and gender, which is discussed
in the following two sections. In section 4.3, it is demonstrated that many Katcha
nouns exhibit gender polarity, changing gender when they change number. Thus a
change in number is often accompanied by a change in (gender) agreement. Moreover,
in section 4.4, it is argued that the value of the third gender class in Katcha is plural.
The confusion about whether the third agreement class represents a gender or plural
is due to the fact that plural is a gender.","[69, 70]"

predicts the ungrammaticality of *akká mʊnɪtá kʊ́rɪ, because the applicative morpheme
is construed as projecting a (LINKed) requirement which entails parsing some addi-
tional lexical items to resolve it. The presence of the applicative morpheme entails
the presence of the benefactive argument. Nonetheless, the account as it stands is too
powerful. The lexical actions of the applicative marker duplicate those of LINK Intro-
duction. Since LINK Introduction is an optional computational rule, there is no
need to also have a lexicalised version, rendering the analysis rather less elegant. More
importantly, it predicts that the benefactive noun phrase could occur grammatically
without the applicative morpheme being present, decorating a ?T y(t) node constructed
by LINK Introduction just like any other event-modifying preposition. Likewise,
this account predicts that any event-modifying preposition could follow the applicative
morpheme. The lexical actions of the applicative morpheme build a LINKed node
and decorate it with a ?T y(t) requirement; this is exactly the context for parsing a
preposition. Thus the current account incorrectly predicts that a sentence like *akka
mʊnɪta kʊrɪ ka kʊkkʊ, with both an applicative verb and a locative phrase, should be
grammatical.
    The problem with this account is that it ascribes the semantic content (ben ′ ) to
the ‘preposition’, leaving the applicative morpheme to undertake a purely structural
task (and one for which there is a pre-existing computational rule). Yet in prototypical
applicative constructions, the applicative morpheme clearly makes a semantic contri-
210                                 Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casebution (many languages have multiple applicative markers with diﬀerent meanings).
Likewise, in prototypical applicatives there is an alternation between semantically (if
not pragmatically) equivalent applicative and adpositional constructions. It should
therefore be expected that an applicative morpheme will in fact build the same semantic
structure as a preposition. A lexical entry for a prototypical applicative morpheme then
might look more like (9.40), which builds a LINK from an event node, but also builds
the LINKed propositional structure, decorating the nodes as appropriate (including a
Formula value for the predicate node), then moves the pointer back to the matrix tree.
These actions build the partial structure indicated in (9.41).","[227, 228, 229]"
"Questionable phonemes. Hall and Hall (2004) suggest a possible contrast between
voiced and voiceless palatal plosives [c] and [ ]: ‘In Katcha, Keiga and Miri, the voiceless
palatal plosive, c, contrasts word initially with the voiced form though c has the less
frequent occurrence’ (Hall and Hall 2004:4). This was not a contrast I found during
ﬁeldwork and consequently in this study all palatal plosives are transcribed as <c>.
It should be noted though, that Hall and Hall make this suggestion under the heading
of ‘Infrequently Occurring Consonants’. They also note that ‘in the other [related]
languages c does not occur, and is a phoneme.’ Their suggestion of a possible contrast
also contradicts their later assertion that ‘Katcha does not have phonemic contrast for
voicing between any phonemes’ (Hall and Hall 2005:4). Dafalla and Schadeberg also
assume non-contrast across the board.
     Contrastingly, I found Katcha speakers to sometimes claim a contrast between /b/
and /p/ (in addition to /ɓ/). It is diﬃcult to know whether this is truly a phonemic
contrast; having been educated in English, they were aware that <b> and <p> are
‘two diﬀerent letters’. However, this was also true for other voiced/voiceless pairs
such as /t/ and[d], /k/ and [ ], etc. which are clearly non-contrastive. I have therefore
retained <b> in Katcha transcriptions where speakers were insistent, but have generally
assumed the phoneme to be /p/ elsewhere.
     Hall and Hall (2004) do not list the glottal stop as a phoneme of Katcha. It does
exist, but is of highly limited distribution, occurring only in the singular forms of the
‘core’ personal pronouns (see chapter 6). This is true throughout the Kadu language
family: ‘The status of the glottal stop is rather special. It occurs in the personal
pronouns in all nine languages, but it is rare or absent elsewhere in the vocabulary’
(Schadeberg 1994:18).
3.1. Consonants                                                                        273.1.2 Consonant clusters and length
Hall and Hall (2004:4) suggest that ‘the range of consonant sequences is restricted…[to]
geminates and nasal+non-nasal clusters.’ This is essentially true, although I found some
instances where there were possible /r/+stop sequences. These were debatable though;
there may have been a vowel in between (Katcha speakers were inconsistent on this
point).
   In the case of plosives, it is clear that ‘long’ plosives are geminates. They only
occur word medially, and as well as length, geminates can be distinguished from
single consonants by voicing. Whereas single consonants are phonetically voiced in
an intervocalic environment, ‘geminated stops are generally voiceless… Geminated im-
plosives…are neither fully voiced nor fully voiceless. It is my impression that they start
as being voiced, and that the vibration of the vocal cords gradually ceases during their
articulation’ (Schadeberg 1994:15).
   For other consonants, the issue of length is less clear. Consonants may be phoneti-
cally longer when they occur at word boundaries, but this is arguably non-phonemic:     Monosyllabic words starting with a fricative s or f regularly lengthen this
     initial consonant. (The same is also true for nasals, and to a lesser degree
     also for liquids and glides.)…This lengthening disappears in word (or utter-
     ance?) medial position… This lengthening does not appear to be contrastive
     (Schadeberg 1994:17).","[45, 46]"
"6.3.2 PossessiveDemonstrative pronouns ja/mɔ/nɔPossessive phrases and relative clauses are formed using the demonstrative pronoun. A
full analysis of these constructions is given in chapter 5. The relevance to the current
discussion is to note that when the possessor (or the subject of the relative clause) is
a pronoun, the oblique form of the pronoun is used. The vowel of the demonstrative
pronoun assimilates to the initial vowel of the pronoun making it long. The initial
vowel takes a high tone. Thus in a context such as (6.46), the ‘possessive pronouns’ are
realised as in (6.47).(6.46) ɲɔrɔɲɔrɔ́ jé-été

Possessive maIn addition to the demonstrative pronoun, nouns may be modiﬁed by the morpheme
ma. According to Stevenson, this is used for ‘non-intimate possession’ (Stevenson
1941:47) or for ‘cases where the relationship is not one of possession, eg. denoting
origin, composition.’ (Stevenson 1956-57:61) It is often used when a noun is modiﬁed
by another nominal, as in (6.48).

(6.49). When the modiﬁer of tumma is introduced by ma, the relationship is non-
possessive (6.49a); when the modiﬁer of tumma is introduced by the demonstrative
pronoun nɔ, the relationship is one of possession (6.49b). In the former case, ‘words of
David’ refers to a story about David; in the latter ‘words of the children’ refers to the
children’s words.7(6.49) a.      aalo aaga kakiïrï          [tumma ma          a ud ] ka     sorne

relationships the demonstrative pronouns are preferred (6.50), while for more distant
relationships ma is used (6.51).

    These facts are not speciﬁc to tʊmma. Stevenson (1991:358) gives a further example: ‘ꞌdi ́ yá Kúkù
would be the ususal form, but ꞌdi ́ má Kúkù (not usual) could mean “a Kuku-like house”, “a house of
the kind Kuku would build.” ’

are ‘owned’ more than distant ones. That the relationship is the relevant factor here
is indicated by (6.52), where both types of ‘possession’ are used in not only the same
source, but the same sentence. Again, the more distant relationships (‘friend’ and
‘clan’) are modiﬁed by ma while the closer relationship (‘brother’) is modiﬁed by the
demonstrative pronoun nɔ.(6.52) fa      t mm n         [kateefe      ma oꞌo ] nja

        ‘do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives’           (LUK 14.12)   Some doubt is thrown on this analysis, however, by the fact that there are some
examples of certain relational nouns occurring with both types of ‘possessive’. These
occur even within the same passage and, unlike the example of (6.49) above, it is not
clear that there is a semantic distinction to which the diﬀerence can be attributed. In
Matthew chapter 5, diidi, ‘enemy’, occurs with both ma and nɔ́ (6.53).

be completely determined by the nature of the relationship. One possibility is simply
that the choice is optional, but it should be noted that in the case of öre,‘brother’,
6.3. Related Morphemes                                                              115the demonstrative is used signiﬁcantly more often than ma, so the association of the
demonstrative construction with the closer relationships is at the very least a strong
tendency.
   Another point to note is that both (6.53) and (6.54) involve obvious contrast. The
pairs of propositions they express are parallel and opposite. The stylistics of written
Katcha prose are outwith the scope of this research but it appears that the translators
have chosen contrasting grammatical constructions to express these contrasts. This is
not just true of the the type of possessive used, but there are also contrasts in tense,
number and vocabulary. So one possibility is that in these cases, the translators have
deliberately used the ‘wrong’ possessive construction for stylistic eﬀect.","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"

evaluated however, the metavariable projected by the demonstrative pronoun has to be
instantiated by a step of Substitution. This is simply a case of retrieving a suitable
candidate from context, such as the particular cow the speaker is pointing at whilst
producing the utterance. In principle the parser is free to choose any candidate, but
the choice may be constrained by the grammatical gender of the pronoun (informally
represented here as a restriction on the metavariable: ‘U ∈ Fem’).
      Assuming a suitable referent can be found, the process of Substitution then
enriches the type e node by replacing the metavariable with another type e expression.
This will necessarily be a unique individual and can therefore be represented by a name.
- an iota term2 whose referent is the unique individual cow being referred to by the
speaker, such as ‘Daisy’ (10.8):

    In previous chapters, I have treated names as constants. However, in Dynamic Syntax they are more
properly represented as ι-terms. These are essentially epsilon terms with the addition of a uniqueness
presupposition: ιx , F (x) picks out the unique individual who satisﬁes F .

sub-tree with respect to the node to which it is LINKed. Such a rule, Appositive
LINK Evaluation, is given in Cann et al. (2005:365). This rule, as shown in (10.9),
takes two LINKed epsilon terms and conjoins them in a single epsilon term with a
complex restrictor. Where, as in the present case, one of the terms is an iota term, the
conjoined term will also be an iota term (an iota term being the more speciﬁc instance
of an epsilon term). Note also that this evaluation rule requires that the two epsilon
terms contain the same variable, ie. both noun phrases refer to the same individual. Up
to this point, nothing has stipulated that the two variables be uniﬁed (though this could
easily have been incorporated as a modal requirement as part of the LINK Apposition
Rule if necessary). However, the formulation of the evaluation rule entails the identity
of the two terms; the sentence can only be successfully parsed if ‘a cow’ and ‘this one’
refer to the same individual. In a sense this is simply the formalisation of a truism: two
noun phrases in apposition refer to the same individual. Application of the evaluation
rule (10.9) leads to the partial tree in (10.10):

tree can now be evaluated in the usual manner, ending up with a complete propositional
formula (10.11) decorating the root node. Thus the parse of the sentence ultimately
leads to the correct semantic interpretation: Musa wants a unique individual x, which
is identiﬁed by the name ‘Daisy’ and is a cow.","[241, 242, 243, 244]"
"Use with personal pronounsWhen the dative is followed by a personal pronoun, the pronouns are mixed: 1st and
2nd person pronouns are taken from the core pronouns, while 3rd person pronouns are
taken from the oblique set.
   In the case of the core pronouns (1st and 2nd person), the dative preposition
appears to undergo elision, as would be expected given its interaction with nominal
complements. The 2nd person plural pronoun has a High-High tone melody, in the
case of the other core pronouns, the melody is consistently Low-High. It is not clear to
what extent this aﬀects the speculation in section 6.1 that tone on core pronouns may
be related to case. In the case of the oblique pronouns (3rd person), the preposition
appears to assimilate to the initial vowel of the pronoun which is therefore realised as
long. The long vowel has a low tone. Thus in the context of an utterance such as
(6.35), the dative pronouns are realised as in (6.36).(6.35) akká        mɔ́            m-anáŋa kʊ́rɪ a á

AccompanimentThe preposition nca marks accompaniment, ‘with’; it is also used for coordination,
‘and’. Both uses are exempliﬁed in (6.37).(6.37) ti ́tó ʊŋ          ka       ɗi ́   n a           kʊ́kkʊ́ n a   kákka
        Tito 3m.be loc house accomp Kuku accomp Kaka
        ‘Tito is in the house with Kuku and Kaka.’
That the ‘and’ use of the accompaniment preposition is genuine co-ordination can be
seen in the fact that when the subject is a conjoined noun phrase, it triggers plural
subject agreement on the verb (6.38).
6.2. Prepositions                                                                          107(6.38)     akariya nja               lisabet       k mm     tumma ma     ogo ana    eedi

          ‘Zacharia and Elizabeth were righteous in God’s eyes.’                   (LUK 1.6)   As noted in section 6.2.1, the instrumental preposition ana can refer to a kind of
‘accompaniment’, where the relationship is unequal. Thus in (6.9), repeated here, the
sentence implies that Kuku is showing the way, whereas in (6.39) the use of nca implies
a joint, equal action.(6.9) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne ana          a á
         Kuku 3m.move instr 1sg
         ‘Kuku is going with me’ (He is showing me the way)

          kuku 3m.move accomp 1sg
          ‘Kuku is going with me’ (We are going together)
Use with personal pronounsWhen the accompaniment preposition is followed by a personal pronoun, the pronouns
take the same form as they do with the dative: 1st and 2nd person pronouns are core
pronouns, while 3rd person pronouns are taken from the oblique set. As with the
dative, the vowel of the preposition is elided with the core pronouns in 1st and 2nd
person, and assimilates to the pronoun vowel with the oblique pronouns in 3rd person.
Tones are also the same as with the dative. Thus in the context of an utterance such
as (6.40), the accompaniment pronouns are realised as in (6.41).(6.40) ti ́tó ʊŋ       ka   ɗi ́     n a          a á

Directional (source)The preposition ntama marks source, ‘from’. It is primarily, if not exclusively, used to
refer to physical direction as exempliﬁed in (6.42)(6.42) kʊ́kkʊ́ oɗo           ntama      sɪːka tá-nɔ́                 i ́ni ́
         Kuku 3m.come source ﬁeld non.core-dem.p 3m
         ‘Kuku is coming from his ﬁeld.’
Use with personal pronounsWhen the directional source preposition is followed by a personal pronoun, it takes
the same mix of pronouns as the dative and accompaniment. Tones and vowel eli-
sion/assimilation are likewise identical. Thus in the context of an utterance such as
(6.43), the directional pronouns are realised as in (6.44).4(6.43) kʊ́kkʊ́ oɗo           ntama      a á

    It should be noted that the speakers I worked with found some of these sentences odd, particularly
where the source is 1st person. It was hard to tell if these are ungrammatical in that ntama cannot be
oriented from the speaker, or if they were merely semantically anomalous. In any case, they were in
unanimous agreement that these were the correct forms of pronoun to use with this preposition.

Katcha has a number of morphemes marking oblique argument roles. Stevenson (1941,
1956-57) describes these as prepositions; Waag (2012) refers to them as case markers.
There is, of course, ‘no necessary universal distinction’ (Payne 1997:100) between
case markers and prepositions — it is perhaps best to think of them as the ends of
a continuum — so either term might be appropriate. However, following Payne’s
deﬁnition of case as being ‘imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase
occurs’ (Payne 1997:100), this chapter will refer to these morphemes as prepositions.2
  2
    This view is revised slightly in chapter 9, where the diﬀerence between adpositions and case is
considered from a Dynamic Syntax perspective. In the light of the discussion there, it may be that
some of the morphemes discussed in this chapter (dative a in particular) would be better thought of as
case markers rather than prepositions.
98                          Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and PrepositionsWith a couple of exceptions, noted in section 6.5, there is no indication that the
occurrence of these prepositions is necessitated by the verb.
     Prepositions in Katcha can be divided into three types according to the form
of pronoun they take as a complement. There are prepositions which require their
(pronominal) complement to be a Core pronoun, and there are prepositions which
require their complement to be an Oblique pronoun. A third paradigm displays a
mixed system, taking Core pronouns in the case of 1st and 2nd person complements,
but Oblique pronouns in the case of 3rd person. (Of course, all prepositions may take
nominal, as well as pronominal, complements.)6.2.1 Prepositions requiring core pronounsInstrumentalThe preposition ana most commonly has an instrumental interpretation (‘with’, ‘by’,
‘by means of’, etc.) as in (6.4).(6.4) akká      mɔ́    m-ʊnɪ       éːmá      a   kʊ́ɓɓʊ́ tɪ ́-já
         woman dem.f 3f-make things instr spoon non.core-dem.3m
         ‘The woman is making food using this spoon’     As can be seen in (6.4), before a consonant the instrumental preposition is realised
as /a/. Before a vowel it is realised as /an/. It is therefore seldom, if ever, acutally
realised as /ana/ in natural speech. Nonetheless, this is the form given when the word
is elicited in isolation and Katcha writers are consistent in spelling it this way, at least
before vowels (before consonants they tend to write it as <a>).
     A clear example of the alternation between /a/ before a consonant and /an/ before
a vowel is given in (6.5-6.6). These sentences are synonymous, though it should be
noted that áːrabi ́ja is borrowed from Arabic. A pair of examples using indigenous
Katcha vocabulary is therefore given in (6.7) and the semantically somewhat unlikely
(6.8).(6.5) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne a         teremɓéːle
         Kuku 3m.move instr car
         ‘Kuku is going by car’
(6.6) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne an        áːrabi ́ja
         Kuku 3m.move instr car
         ‘Kuku is going by car’
6.2. Prepositions                                                                    99(6.7) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne a      mʊttʊ́
       Kuku 3m.move instr horse
       ‘Kuku is going by horse’
(6.8) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne an     úŋku
       Kuku 3m.move instr leopard
       ‘Kuku is going by leopard’   The instrumental preposition tends to mark a less active or subordinate participant.
Thus in (6.9) (where the complement of ana is a human) the sentence implies that
Kuku, the sentential subject, is showing the way. If the intended interpretation was
one of joint action (‘Kuku is going with me’ i.e. we are going together) the appropriate
preposition would be accompaniment nca (see section 6.2.3).(6.9) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne ana    a á
       Kuku 3m.move instr 1sg
       ‘Kuku is going with me’ (He is showing me the way)Similarly, when used in conjunction with the verb öꞌdö ‘come’, ana gives the meaning
‘bring’ (6.10-6.11):(6.10) kïkkïrï kööꞌdö             a       kisine nja      ꞌbiiꞌbala miini

        ‘They brought a pair of doves.’                                     (LUK 2.24)(6.12) illustrates a further use of ana, again marking a subordinate participant. (The
preposition in the ﬁrst clause is potentially ambiguous between ana and dative a (see
section 6.2.3), but the occurence of ana aꞌa in the second clause shows this to be an
example of the instrumental.

Use with personal pronounsWhen the instrumental preposition is followed by a personal pronoun, the pronoun is
taken from the core pronouns. In fact, ana seems to be the only preposition which takes
core pronouns as its complement throughout the entire paradigm, as given in (6.13).
The paradigm given in (6.13) was elicited using example (6.9) as a context: ‘Kuku is
going with me’, etc.","[116, 117, 118, 119]"

(10.13) F o(Want′ (ιx , (Daisy′ (x)))(Musa′ ) ∧ Cow′ (ιx , (Daisy′ (x))))Despite these diﬀerences, the propositional formulae in (10.11) and (10.13) are logically
equivalent. Formulae containing epsilon terms can be algorithmically restructured to
create atomic formulae which are simple in terms of being quantiﬁer-free, but whose
terms have internal structure (including quantiﬁcation). Kempson et al. (2001:245-248)
give term reconstruction rules for formulae containing ϵ- and τ -terms4 ; applying these
   4
    Kempson et al. (2001) treat names as logical constants rather than ι-terms and do not therefore
deﬁne a term reconstruction rule for ι-terms. Of course, the semantics of deﬁnites has been a subject of
debate for over a century, and it is not my intention to discuss the exact formulation of a reconstruction
rule for ι-terms here. For now, I treat ι-terms as a special (more speciﬁed) case of ϵ-terms and assume
that the reconstruction rule will therefore produce an output with essentially the same form as the
rule for ϵ-terms, glossing over the exact formal mechanism. Note also that for reasons of clarity, I have
treated the name Musa′ as a logical constant rather than an ι-term; this should not be considered an
attempt to show any formal diﬀerence between Musa′ and Daisy′ , but merely notational shorthand.

pretation of the Katcha sentence should be equivalent to the corresponding English
sentence; anything else would be problematic. Nonetheless, it is a nice result in the
sense that, while the ﬁnal formula value reﬂects the semantic equivalence between the
two languages, the diﬀerent tree structures produced by the parsing process reﬂect the
diﬀering strategies of the two languages. English noun phrases and Katcha noun phrases
are structured somewhat diﬀerently, but the actions and rules used in the parsing
process, such as the construction and evaluation of LINK relations, are standard DS
rules and not language-speciﬁc. Appying them in the normal way to either the Katcha
data or the English data leads to the correct result.","[245, 246]"

8.3 Passive
The subject of a Passive sentence is the patient/theme. So in (8.29), the passive
morphology indicates that kʊrɪ will be interpreted as the logical object.(8.29) kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-tené

           ‘some food is being cooked’The lexical actions projected by the passive morphology therefore serve to ensure that
the pointer is left on the logical object node. The subject can then be processed in the
usual way, which means it will decorate the internal argument node.
      There are two strategies that could be used to encode this.
      The ﬁrst is to treat passive verbs as lexical items and parse the verb and suﬃx
together as a unit (8.30). This would treat passive verbs as having a diﬀerent set of

                                 go(⟨↓0 ⟩), put(F o(U), ?∃x.F o(x), T y(e)),
                      ELSE       abortThe second approach is to assume that the verb is parsed as normal and then the
passive suﬃx is parsed separately. The suﬃx then simply has the eﬀect of moving the
pointer from the external argument node to the internal argument node (8.31):(8.31) Lexical entry for passive suﬃx -tené
              IF        T y(e), ?∃x.F o(x), ⟨↑0 ⟩?T y(es → t)
       -tené THEN go(⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↓1 ⟩⟨↓0 ⟩)
                   ELSE       abortAt this stage there is no clear reason not to assume the latter, compositional approach.
In this case the lexical actions associated with the passive suﬃx (8.31) check that
the pointer is on the logical subject node (⟨↑0 ⟩?T y(es → t)) and that it still requires
a formula value (?∃x.F o(x)). The latter condition prevents a successful parse of the
passive suﬃx where the logical subject node has already been decorated by the preverbal
syntactic subject. In other words, a verb marked with a passive suﬃx is incompatible
with the syntactic subject being interpreted as agent. If these conditions are met, the
lexical actions simply move the pointer on to the logical object node, and then the
parse proceeds as for transitive verbs. Thus in parsing (8.29), the subject and verb
are parsed, giving the tree in (8.32).9 The passive suﬃx is then parsed and its actions
move the pointer to the logical object node, where the metavariable may be resolved
by uniﬁcation with the unﬁxed node, as in (8.33).

     The internal structure of the term projected by the syntactic subject, ϵx , Food′ (x)), is not relevant,
so it is suppressed for clarity. As usual lambda operators and their variables are also suppressed.

   Having fulﬁlled all requirements on the internal argument node the tree can be
compiled in the usual manner. The external argument node is unaﬀected by the passive:
it remains decorated by a metavariable and a formula requirement. An appropriate
referent for the agent therefore has to be found, substituted from context if there is no
suitable linguistic referent. This characterisation of the passive therefore ensures that
there is always a referential argument reading for the agent, i.e. that there is always
a semantic agent, even if this is only implied. Once the agent node is decorated with
an appropriate agent the ﬁnal logical form is as in (8.34), which is of course truth-
conditionally equivalent to its active counterpart.

        ‘drums are hit for wrestling (habitually)’   The lexical actions associated with the unaccusative directly correlate with those
of the antipassive. The diﬀerence of course, is that unaccusative constructions are
‘agentless’ rather than ‘patientless’, that is, the unaccusative decorates the logical
subject node rather than the logical object node with a value indicating an individual
which is indeﬁnite, arbitrary and context-dependent.
   In processing a sentence such as (8.35), after parsing the subject and verb, we have
the partial tree in (8.36), with a type e term projected by the subject decorating an
unﬁxed node, and the pointer sitting on the logical subject node:

for the logical object, the lexical actions associated with the unaccusative morpheme
build an epsilon structure from the logical subject node. This epsilon structure has

by the syntactic subject can instantiate the metavariable. As was the case with the
antipassive, the node it uniﬁes with happens to be the logical object node of the epsilon
term rather than of the matrix proposition, but this is of no consequence because the
two nodes are linked by the copy mechanism, so will end up being decorated with the
same Formula value. It just happens to be that the incremental nature of Dynamic
Syntax entails the lower node be instantiated ﬁrst. The tree can now be compiled as
normal, the pointer working its way up the tree compiling the epsilon term to decorate
the logical subject node of the propositional tree. The requirement for a formula value
on the propositional object node means that the pointer has to move down to that
node to update the metavariable there, which it will do using the value that has been
established for V during the process of constructing the epsilon term. The ﬁnal tree
for (8.35) is then as shown in (8.39) (with ϵy , Drum′ (y) abbreviated to D′ ), the root

"   When used in a relative clause, demonstrative já/mɔ́/nɔ́ is a relative marker encod-
ing the function of Attribution, rather than a relative pronoun encoding Gap Construc-
tion. Gap Construction is concerned with the role of the relativised element within the
relative clause and is therefore marked by a pronoun (relative or resumptive) whose case
marks its role in the subordinate clause; Attribution is concerned with the relationship
of the relative clause to the head and is therefore ‘indicated by ϕ-feature agreement
with the head – i.e. person, number, gender, class (+ϕ, in short) – and placement at the
sentence border’ (de Vries 2002:157). To put this another way, relative pronouns of the
sort found in Europe are ‘dependant-focused’ and therefore exhibit the case required
by the dependant, whilst relative markers of the sort found in Africa are ‘head-focused’
and therefore agree with the head.",[108]
"11.2.2 Adjuncts, prepositions and case
The choice of pronominal form in Katcha is heavily dependent on the role it plays in
the sentence and (in oblique cases) which preposition it follows. It can therefore be
concluded that these diﬀerent forms are realisations of case. Core cases (Nominative
and Accusative) are assigned by verbs, while prepositions assign Accusative or Oblique
case to their pronominal complements.
   As regards the distribution of prepositional phrases, it was argued in chapter 9 that
prepositional phrases should be treated as adjuncts. A prepositional phrase speciﬁes an
additional property of some expression of the matrix proposition, providing a predicate
11.2. Theoretical ﬁndings                                                            255which takes such an expression as one of its arguments. That expression may be a
term (an individual or event) in the case of an adjectival PP, or a predicate in the case
of an adverbial PP. In Dynamic Syntax terms, prepositions induce structure which is
LINKed to the matrix propositional tree and which shares semantic content with some
node in the matrix tree.
   The construal of prepositional phrases as LINKed structures, and prepositions as
predicates, explicitly categorises them as modiﬁers. There are therefore substantial
parallels to be seen between prepositional phrases and other modiﬁers. The distinction
between intersective and subsective PPs, for example, parallels the same distinction
seen in the semantics of adjectives. Similarly, the treatment of prepositional phrases
oﬀered here draws explicit parallels between (adjectival) prepositional phrases and
relative clauses. Both prepositional phrases and relative clauses project propositions
which share an argument with the matrix proposition. It is therefore not surprising
that they should use the same basic technical apparatus. The diﬀerence between them
is that relatives include an anaphoric device (either a relative pronoun or a resumptive
pronoun), which introduces the shared argument into their sub-proposition. Like bare
relatives in English, prepositional phrases contain no such anaphoric device so the
shared argument must be introduced by the LINK-COPY Introduction rule.
   Sections 9.5 and 9.6 demonstrated that this analysis is also relevant to constructions
other than prepositional phrases, and both applications have potential theoretical
implications. In section 9.5 it was argued that applicatives can be treated in just
the same way as prepositions. The diﬀerence between the two constructions is one
of constituency: the complement of a preposition immediately follows it, whereas the
applied object (which is construed as the complement of the applicative morpheme)
does not necessarily follow immediately after the applicative marker. To state that
applicatives and adpositions are essentially equivalent is therefore something of a
challenge to the importance of the notion of constituency, which is central to most
theories of syntax.
   The DS analysis given here also has implications for how the relationship between
case and adpositions is viewed. Case markers and adpositions are often seen as two
ends of a continuum with no great diﬀerence between them. However, the DS account
of case as a ﬁlter on well-formed structure is quite diﬀerent from the account of adpo-
sitions, which induce a LINKed sub-tree, building semantic structure and contributing
a semantic predicate. The account oﬀered here can therefore be argued to draw a
substantive theoretical distinction between case and adpositions. It suggests that the
diﬀerence is semantic: case morphemes are semantically null and build no structure,
while adpositions contribute semantic content and also induce semantic structure.

The analysis of Katcha nominal modiﬁers as appositional demonstrative phrases is
modelled in DS by LINK Apposition. The properties projected by two noun phrases
in apposition are interpreted as holding of a single individual in a straightforward
manner.
   The relation between the demonstrative pronoun and the rest of the modiﬁer is not
quite so straightforward to model. It requires an analysis of demonstrative pronouns
which extends the actions associated with them to include the construction of more
semantic structure than is standard in Dynamic Syntax. Pronouns are seen not only to
be placeholders but also to build partial epsilon structures. Speciﬁcally, they project
an argument variable and an epsilon binder, but no restrictor. The restrictor may be
provided by substitution of a referent from context, in which case the demonstrative
has a deﬁnite, pronominal interpretation. Alternatively, it may be provided by a verb,
in which case the demonstrative essentially acts as a relativiser. Another possibility
is that the restrictor’s value is constructed from some contextually provided value
expressing some relationship, such as possession, between the argument variable and
some other term. These possibilities directly model the fact that the interpretation of a
demonstrative pronoun is dependent on what follows in the rest of the modiﬁer phrase.
   Key to this analysis is the strong formal distinction between pronouns and lexical
nouns. The construal of pronouns as underspeciﬁed forms contrasts with lexical nouns
which build semantic structure so completely speciﬁed that nouns cannot be modiﬁed
directly. Nouns project entire epsilon-structures; pronouns, even the non-standard
version presented here, retain their function of acting as placeholders to be updated by
the parsing of other lexical material. As such, it is no surprise that pronouns should
behave quite diﬀerently from lexical nouns.","[273, 274, 275]"

154                                                   Theoretical Analyses: Verb Extensions       Like most contemporary syntactic theories, Dynamic Syntax is lexicalist – language
variation resides in the lexicon – and (8.7) shows an example of this. The lexical
actions in (8.6) reﬂect the fact that Katcha is a full pro-drop language by decorating
the argument nodes with metavariables, represented as U and V. Metavariables are
objects which act as placeholders for contentful Formula values. They do not constitute
expressions in the epsilon/lambda calculi and so must be replaced by such an expression,
this is marked formally by the requirement ?∃x.F o(x). In this way, they satisfy a type
requirement but replace it with a formula requirement. The formula requirement does
not have to be fulﬁlled through a linguistic source. One way it may be done is through
Substitution, a pragmatic process in which a suitable referent is chosen from context.
Thus (8.8) is a grammatical sentence. (In non-pro-drop languages the argument nodes
are decorated merely with a type requirement (?T y(e)), meaning that Substitution
is not a possibility and some lexical item is needed to provide the node with a value.)(8.8) abʊ
          3m.beat
          ‘he hits him/her/it’       After constructing and decorating the propositional template, the lexical actions of
the verb leave the pointer on the external argument node as in (8.7).3 The metavariable
on this node can be resolved by indentifying the unﬁxed node and the external argument
node. This is done by the computational action of Unification, which allows two type-
identical nodes with compatible addresses and content to be brought together. The
unﬁxed node has a deﬁned formula value but an underspeciﬁed tree node address, while
the external argument node has a deﬁned position in the tree but an underspeciﬁed
formula value. Both are type e, so they may be Unified (8.9).","[172, 173]"

5.1 Demonstratives
The demonstrative in Katcha follows the noun, coming at the end of the noun phrase.
The form of the demonstrative depends on the degree of distance and the gender of the
noun, as listed in table 5.1.
     The proximal demonstrative is by far the most commonly occurring. As well as
being used for physical deixis, it is used in discourse to refer anaphorically to linguistic
antecedents. Examples of spontaneous use are numerous (5.1).(5.1) a. omuɗi já              aɗiːla
           man     prox.m 3m.good           ‘That man is good’                                               (ADVICE:1.1)

therefore occur much less frequently. Spontaneously occurring examples of them being
used to modify a noun are harder to come by, but examples gathered through controlled

      My data matches Stevenson’s for the medials, and also for the masculine and plural distals.
Stevenson does not give a separate feminine form of the distal demonstrative, but instead suggests
that a feminine form of inːi exists, namely m-inːi. He also gives k-inːi as an alternative plural form, so
it seems that this refers to a predicative use of inːi (‘be there’). Stevenson does also acknowledge the
existence of um:u, though he suggests it is an emphatic version of mɔ́.

When demonstratives occur with a noun which is not a core argument of the verb, this
is marked morphologically by adding a preﬁx t- to the demonstrative (5.6).(5.5) a a n-asáːsá    [tɪŋkere nɔ́       ]
      1sg 1sg-want bed            prox.p      ‘I want this bed’

          1sg 1sg-sleep loc bed             obl-prox.p          ‘I sleep on this bed’

                                               ́             ]
          1sg 1sg-sleep loc bed             obl-med.m/p          ‘I sleep on that bed’
      c. a a n-afʊ́ŋɔ́     [ká   tɪŋkéré t- ́n            ]
          1sg 1sg-sleep loc bed             obl-dist.m/p          ‘I sleep on that bed (way over there)’
5.1.2 Demonstratives as Pronouns
It is not necessary to include the head noun; a noun phrase may be made up of only
the demonstrative:(5.7) a. a a n-asáːsá    já
          1sg 1sg-want prox.m
          ‘I want this one’
      b. a a n-asáːsá       k
                              ́
          1sg 1sg-want med.m/p
          ‘I want that one’
      c. a a n-asáːsá     ́n
          1sg 1sg-want dist.m/p
          ‘I want that one (way over there)’This suggests that the demonstrative may be considered a pronoun rather than merely
a determiner. Indeed, it is possible to answer a question such as (5.8) with a single
word answer (5.9a-c):
5.2. Possessive Noun Phrases                                                              69(5.8) ɲɔrɔɲɔrɔ́ ócó    ɪ ɪ   ʊŋːɔ́      á   útú k-asáːsâ
       k.o.spear which 3ms 3ms.exist dat 2s dcm-want
       ‘Which spear do you want?’
(5.9) a. já
            prox.m
            ‘This one’
       b. ékê
            med.m
            ‘That one’
       c. i ́nːi ̂
            dist.m
            ‘That one (way over there)’It is possible that (5.7) and (5.9) are examples of ellipsis, or that Katcha has both
demonstrative pronouns and demonstrative determiners which are homophonous. How-
ever, Diessel (1999:60) ﬁnds that in most languages, ‘there is no evidence that pronom-
inal and adnominal demonstratives belong to diﬀerent categories’ and this seems to
be the case in Katcha. Not only is there no indication that demonstratives belong
to the same paradigm as determiners such as deﬁnite or indeﬁnite articles, there is
no evidence that such determiners exist in Katcha. The fact that noun phrases most
commonly consist of only a noun suggests strongly that Katcha has no articles (Dryer
2007:152). Likewise, the fact that both nouns and demonstratives can occur alone in
noun phrases suggests there is no dependency relationship between them. It seems
likely that ‘determiner’ does not exist as a syntactic category in Katcha, and that all
occurrences of demonstratives are therefore pronouns.","[85, 86, 87, 88]"

7.4 Reciprocal and Reﬂexive
In (7.7), repeated here as (7.36), -ceːné is given as a possible Reciprocal suﬃx.(7.36) a. kʊ́kkʊ́ ɪcɪ ́           ɓɪ ́ːɓálá
               Kuku 3m.wake boy
               ‘Kuku wakes the boy’
           b. laːlá ɪcɪ-   n ́
               boys 3m.wake-recip
               ‘the children wake each other’Given the pattern that exists in Katcha of verb extensions marking information about
the arguments of the verb, it is natural to suppose that the Reciprocal marker should be
considered to belong to this group of suﬃxes. However, there is also evidence that casts
doubt on this analysis, suggesting that the Reciprocal marker should not be considered
a suﬃx which changes the verb’s argument structure, but a pronominal element which
is the object of the verb.10 There are two pieces of evidence which might support the
latter view.
       The ﬁrst comes from the form of the morpheme: it seems clear that the Reciprocal
marker is derived from either the Accompaniment preposition nca or the verb cɔ ‘go’
(which may be used to indicate directionality; see section 6.3.1), plus the 3rd person
plural pronoun ené. Thus it is literally ‘with/to them’. Of course the fact that the
Reciprocal marker looks like a pronoun does not prove that it is synchronically a
pronoun, rather than historically derived from one, but it may be.
       The second piece of evidence comes from the fact that Katcha reﬂexives (which are,
of course, conceptually very similar to reciprocals) are not expressed using a verbal
suﬃx, but using an idiomatic possessed noun phrase, sometimes using ɔ́ːna, ‘body’, as
  10
    It is not one of the goals of this study to develop a theory of wordhood in Katcha. I have no strong
opinions on whether -ceːné should be considered a suﬃx, clitic or word. However, if it could be shown
that -ceːné should be analysed as a separate word, that would rule out the possibility of it being a verb
extension.

cals would also be expressed using a (pro)nominal construction. However, the evidence
is fairly inconclusive so it is possible that the Reciprocal marker may in fact be a verb
extension after all.","[163, 164]"
"6.1.1 Pronoun Set 1 - ‘Core’ pronouns
The primary function of the ﬁrst set of pronouns is to express the core arguments of a
sentence: the subject and the direct object (i.e. argument roles S, A and P). For this
reason, this set may be referred to as the Core pronouns. However as will be seen in
section 6.2, these forms also appear with certain prepositions, so they do also express
some peripheral arguments.
      There are eight forms of the core pronouns, listed in (6.1). The 1st and 2nd person
pronouns distinguish singular and plural, while in the case of 1st person plural there is
a further distinction according to the inclusion or exclusion of the addressee. There are
three 3rd person pronouns, distinguishing grammatical gender (Masculine, Feminine
and Plural gender).",[115]
