13.2.1 Clause-final interrogative particles13.2.1.1 Polar (yes/no) interrogative maThe polar interrogative clause-final particle is (atonal) ma. It is arguably
identical to the disjunctive particle ma ‘or’ (§7.2.1). If this equation is correct, it
raises the interesting question whether one sense (interrogative or disjunctive) is
basic. In German, oder ‘if’ is often added to a statement as a kind of polar tag
question marker: Du hast schon gegessen, oder? ‘you have already eaten, or?’.
If the disjunctive sense is taken as basic in Jamsay, then we have a possible
structural parallel to the German construction, functioning however as the basic
polar-question construction. Since the final ‘or’ (in this interpretation) is the
truncation of a fuller version of the (polarized) second clause (‘you have already
eaten, or [sc. you have not yet eaten]?’), this would account for the typical
nonterminal intonation of the Jamsay particle (see below). On the other hand, a
disjunction of the type ‘X or Y’ could be taken as a kind of question in many
contexts: compare ‘X or Y will come’ with ‘(I wonder whether) X will come,
(or) Y will come’. Moreover, many polar questions involve disjunctions: ‘Will
X or Y come?’.
     However, a complete identification of the polar-question and disjunctive
particles is doubtful. It will be seen below that ma is also optionally used after
WH-interrogatives, which are not interpretable as disjunctions.
     The Jamsay particle appears with variable pitch and duration. In my
interpretation, it is subject first to Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137),
which extends the preceding phonological tone into the particle, resulting in ma@
or ma$. Of these, ma$ is more common (at least at the end of full clauses), since
positive inflected verbs all end in L-tones. After this rule applies, the particle is
then frequently (but not obligatorily) subject to intonational modification, in
the form either of prolongation (), pitch-raising (), or both ().
     Whether intonationally raised or not, the pitch is often steady-state during
the articulation of the particle. However, I have occasionally observed a slowly
falling pitch that I indicate with symbols , similar to the dying-quail
intonation (symbol ).
     In polar interrogatives, the corresponding reverse-polarity statement, or
some other proposition contradicting the first, may also be added. In this case,
ma occurs minimally once, at the junction between the two propositions. The
prosodic grouping is variable, with ma often clearly grouped with the preceding

‘if’ may be added. This makes sense when an overt quotative verb is present: ‘if

13.2.1.2 Tag-question (Negative la$˘)Negative la$˘, which is very common after ‘it is’ clitic y$ (§11.2.1.3), is also
used after a proposition-expressing clause, in (polarity-reversed) tag-question
function. One text, from an elderly man addressing a much younger interviewer,
was full of uptake-checking expressions, including (763).(763)   pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w<           la$˘

rhetorical question, eliciting confirmation from the younger interlocutor.(764)   di ˘$ <    a$nsa@˘ra@  ka@r<-a@˘r<a$-Ø           ji ˘$ <

        that, …’ 2004.4.23    A rhetorical tag question may also be expressed as a polarity-reversed
version of the initial proposition, reduced to its inflected verb. In (765), the
speaker bemoans the fact that young women of the village often go to cities to
work, and come back pregnant. The tag reverses the negative polarity of the
primary proposition.

2.2    Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbsMost if not all Dogon languages are verb-final, and this is true of Jamsay.
However, the verb can be followed by clause-linking subordinators and certain
discourse particles like ‘only’ with clausal scope. In addition, some normally
preverbal constituents, especially adverbial phrases, are occasionally added (as
afterthoughts or clarifications) after the verb, with an intervening pause.
     Verb stems must respect well-defined restrictions on segmental form and
lexical tones. Regular verbs end in a long vowel if monosyllabic, in a short
vowel if longer. The stem-level lexical tone pattern of a verb can only be all-H
or L(L…)H with H on the final mora.
     In non-imperative, non-focalized main clauses, the verb has the basic
structure (2), omitting some details.(2)      [stem - (derivational suffix)] - aspect/negation - pronominal subjectBeginning with the final element, verbs are inflected for subject person and
number category (1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg/Nonhuman, 3Pl); see §10.2. The
3Sg/Nonhuman suffix is -Ø. The pronominal subject suffix may be the only
expression of the subject, or it may agree with an unfocalized preverbal NP. In
the unsuffixed Imperfective (positive), Nonhuman subject is distinguished from
(human) 3Sg subject by adding quasi-verb kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ after the
regular verb stem.
                                          2.2 Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbs   11     Negation is also expressed by verbal suffixation; there are distinct Negative
suffixes for perfective and imperfective verbs, immediately preceding the
pronominal suffixes (hence verb-Neg-pronominal); see §10.1.3. Examples of
positive inflected verbs are in (3.a-b), followed by examples of negative
inflected verbs (3.c-d). Note the zero 3SgS suffix in (3.b).(3)     a. yE$rE@-m$

           go-PerfNeg-1PlS
           ‘We did not go.’    As the interlinear glosses in (3.c-d) suggest, the verbal suffixal system
marks aspect as well as negation; I refer to these as AN (aspect-negation)
categories. The positive categories are listed in (4); the fuller treatment is in
§10.1.2. The division between the two systems is justified by semantics and
textual patterning. For example, the unsuffixed Perfective (in the syntactic
contexts that require it) may correspond to any of several marked perfective-
system categories in other contexts, and the unsuffixed Imperfective is likewise
the unmarked, all-purpose imperfective-system form. Similar neutralizations
occur in negative AN categories.

               [Rdp + final L-tone] reduplicated Imperfective      In the perfective system, the unsuffixed Perfective is the basic form used in
the presence of a focalized constituent, and in relative clauses. In other
(positive) clauses, there is a choice between the Perfective (-ti$-, -yE$-/-ya$-, or
-a^˘-) and the other more specialized categories listed. In the imperfective
system, the unsuffixed Imperfective is the most common form, but it gets some
competition from suffixally marked categories. There is a relatively low-
frequency reduplicated option in both perfective and imperfective systems.
      The importance of tones in distinguishing inflectional categories, and in
distinguishing main from relative clauses, can be brought out by considering the
verb ‘fight’ (5).(5)      lexical        unsuffixed Perfective          unsuffixed Impf Imprt
                      main clause relative clause         jE$yE@       jE$yE$-     jE@yE$-              jE$yE^˘-        jE@yE@

stem in verb chains, and before non-Negative AN suffixes. The unsuffixed
Perfective undergoes tone-dropping to all-L jE$yE$- in main clauses (after a
focalized constituent), but has the H(H…)L overlay in relative clauses, where it
appears as HL-toned jE@yE$-. The unsuffixed Imperfective is underlying /jE$yE@- L/,
as a final floating L-tone follows the stem; if there is no audible pronominal

vowel (now <HL>-toned) is lengthened to two moras to allow the contour tone
to be expressed. Finally, the Imperative is all-H-toned jE@yE@. In other words, this
CvCv- stem can appear with LH, LL, HL, LF, and HH tones. These tonal
distinctions, while occasionally redundant (LL before Negative suffix), are in
several cases the sole expression of the relevant morphosyntactic category.
      In negative indicative clauses, though some suffixally marked aspects can
occur, aspect tends to be reduced to a simple perfective-imperfective opposition,
expressed by the portmanteau suffixes -li@- (Perfective Negative) and -go@-
(Imperfective Negative); see (3.c-d), above, and §10.1.3. There is a distinct,
aspectually undifferentiated Negative suffix -la@- for adjectives and some stative
verbs and quasi-verbs (§11.4.3), and similar but L-toned Negative morphemes
(la$˘, la$) are used in a few minor constructions (§11.2.1.3-4).
      Imperative verbs (§10.4) have a distinct set of inflections for subject (2Sg
[=zero], 2Pl), and special negative (i.e. prohibitive) forms, as seen in (6) with
verb yE$rE@ ‘come’.(6)     a. yE@rE@

           ‘Come-Sg!’        b. yE@rE@-y$

           come-Imprt.Pl          ImprtNeg.Pl
           ‘Don’t-Pl come!’     There is a Hortative with suffix -m@ (10.4.3).
     There are also a handful of aspectually defective quasi-verbs meaning
‘say’, ‘be’, ‘have’, and ‘be in’ with Cv- and CvC- shapes, which are not
otherwise allowable for Jamsay verb stems. The morphosyntax of the various
elements is variable, and “quasi-verb” is an intentionally vague cover term. In
most cases they occur with L-tone in main clauses and with H(H…)L tone in
relative clauses, which aligns them formally with the unsuffixed Perfective of
regular verbs. Some of the quasi-verbs are segmentally identical to AN suffixes,
suggesting the possibility that the quasi-verb is really just an AN suffix added to
a phonologically empty verb slot. See §11.2.2-3, §11.5.1 for the full coverage.
There are also some stative stance and ‘hold’ verbs that are aspectually
defective, occurring in perfective forms only (§11.2.4, §11.5.2).
14    Sketch
    The ‘say’ verb ga@˘-, quasi-verb jE$-, and quotative particle wa (wa$, wa@)
(§11.3) constitute a complex subject in Jamsay and other Dogon languages.
Some clause-subordinating elements are based on the ‘say’ verb or quasi-verb
(§15.2.2)
2.3    ParticiplesIn relative clauses (and therefore in various spatio-temporal and manner clauses
in relative form, as well as in various agentive compounds), the verb takes a
Participial suffix instead of a pronominal subject suffix (§14.1.8). The
Participial suffixes are Nonhuman -Ø, (human) Sg -n, and (human) Pl -m.
These are the same suffixes used with most simple nouns, and with adjectives.
The Participial suffix agrees with the head of the relative, regardless of its
grammatical relation (subject, object, etc.).
     The verb in a relative clause, if perfective (positive), normally appears in a
special H(H…)L-toned form of the unsuffixed Perfective.
     Because participial agreement is with the head rather than with the subject,
in non-subject relatives some way must be found to express a pronominal
subject. This is accomplished by using a set of L-toned preverbal subject
pronominal proclitics, corresponding functionally to the subject pronominal
suffixes that occur on verbs in main clauses. (These L-toned pronominals are
not used in subject relatives, where the subject is indexed in the participial
ending.)
     Therefore the way to say ‘the place where I saw you’ can be schematized as
(7).(7)      place.L 2SgO     1SgS.L    see.Perf.HL-Ppl.Nonh    The head is ‘place’, so it appears with L-tone (“place.L”). Since this is a
nonhuman noun, we get Nonhuman Participial suffix (“Ppl.Nonh”) on the verb.
There is a 2Sg object pronominal proclitic (H-toned u@), and an L-toned
preverbal subject pronominal proclitic (1Sg mi $). Since the verb is perfective
positive, it appears in the unsuffixed Perfective, with H(H…)L tone contour
overlaid. The actual Jamsay phrase is (8).(8)      di ˘$ <   u@   mi $     E^˘-Ø
2.4    Noun phrase (NP)A full-sized NP could have the linear sequence (9), omitting some details.
                                                                 2.4 Noun phrase     15(9)     a.   possessor NP followed by ma$ ‘of’, or simple pronoun as possessor
        b.   noun stem
        c.   adjective (simple or expanded)
        d.   demonstrative or ‘each, any’ quantifier
        e.   numeral, Pl particle, and/or Definite particle
        f.   ‘all’     The noun stem itself may be a compound. Many human nouns, and
adjectives when referring to a human, take the suffix Sg -n or Pl -m. Human
nouns that for one reason or another cannot take these suffixes (e.g. most kin
terms) may be followed by Pl particle be@. Nonhuman nouns lack morphological
number marking, but they can be followed by be@ to emphasize plurality.
     An example of a fairly complex NP is (10), with the head bolded in the
interlinear. It consists of a possessor, a head noun, two modifying adjectives,
and a Pl morpheme. ‘House’ and ‘small’ undergo tone-dropping to all L-tones
(indicated by “.L” in interlinears) because each is followed by a modifying
adjective. The possessor (1Sg) and the final Pl morpheme be@ do not interact
tonally with the head noun or with the adjectives. One can therefore bracket off
an inner core NP defined by tonal interaction, as opposed to peripheral
elements that have no tonal interaction with the core (tonal independence).(10)    [ma@ [u$ro$      da$ƒa$ pi@ru@] be@]
        [1SgP [house.L small.L white] Pl]
        ‘my small white houses’      More complex examples are given in §6.1; of particular interest are
numerals, which do not interact tonally with preceding nouns and adjectives
(§6.5), and inalienable possessors for kin terms, which force a tone overlay on
the kin term itself (§6.2.2).
      In addition to tonal dependence versus independence, a further issue
relevant to internal NP structure is what happens when a multi-word NP
functions as head of a relative. For example, if (10) is a relative head, as in (11)
below, its first four words remain together (though pi@ru@ drops tones to become
pi r$ u$), but Plural be@ detaches itself and appears at the end of the relative clause,
following the participialized verb (and, usually, Definite ku$<).(11)    [ma@ [u$ro$    da$ƒa$ pi $ru$]] nu@mo$-Ø              ku$< be@
        [1SgP [house.L small.L white.L] fall.Perf.HL-Ppl.Nonh Def Pl
        ‘my small white houses that fell’    There is a partial correlation, among postnominal elements in NPs, between
such detachability and the lack of tonal interaction when adjacent. However,
16    Sketch
the correlation is imperfect; for example, cardinal numerals have no tonal
interaction with preceding nouns, but are not detachable.
     Pronominal categories are 1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg (human), 3Pl (human),
and Nonhuman. They are expressed as subject-pronominal suffixes on verbs
(with 3Sg and Nonhuman merged as zero in most AN categories), as proclitic-
like particles preceding verbs or postpositions, and as independent pronominals.
Anaphorics include a Reflexive pronoun i n   $ i $w<e@ (§18.1), a set of expressions
of the type ‘my/your/his head’ with reflexive-like functions (§18.1.3), and a
noun-like morpheme E$nE@ (plural E$nE@ be@) that is used both for third person
reflexive possessor (‘he killed his own dog’, §18.1.2) and, in third-person
reported speech and thought, as a syntactically unrestricted logophoric pronoun
coindexed with the quoted author (‘she said/thought [she would come]’,
§18.2.1).","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]"
"
11.2    ‘Be’, ‘become’, and other stativesUnder this rubric I consider a range of defective verbs, quasi-verbs, clitics, and
morphologically regular verb stems that have stative (and inchoative) senses,
revolving around ‘be’ and ‘become’.
     Defective verbs (with meanings like ‘have in one’s possession’ and ‘be
sitting’) have incomplete paradigms. For example, in positive clauses they occur
only in the unsuffixed Perfective (L-toned sem, no AN suffix). See §11.2.4
(stance verbs) and §11.5.2 (verbs of possession). Quasi-verbs are a set of
morphemes with shapes Cv- and Cvn- (not otherwise allowed for verb stems)
that, like the defective verbs, fail to allow aspectual suffixation. Of the quasi-
verbs covered in this section (§11.2), the locational-existentials wç$- and kç$ are
arguably pronominals rather than verbs morphologically (§11.2.2.2-4), while
ku$n- ‘be in’ is more verb-like (cf. ku@no@- ‘put in’). These quasi-verbs have
special Negative forms with suffix -rv@- (postvocalic) or -v@ (postconsonantal).
     Also covered here are the morphologically regular verbs be@˘- ‘remain,
happen’ and ta@Na@- ‘become, happen’ (§11.2.6.1-2) since they verge
semantically on the other ‘be’-type elements treated here. There is also a section
on the expression di g  $ E$-la@- ‘doesn’t connect’ (§11.2.5).
     y$ ‘it is’ and allomorphs is a pure clitic. In addition, ‘be’ and ‘be in’ quasi-
verbs are cliticized to a preceding word or particle under some conditions. The
criterion for recognizing clitics is any telltale phonological interaction with the
preceding element (§3.6).
                                         11.2 ‘Be’, ‘become’, and other statives   40311.2.1 Copula clitic ‘it is …’ (y$, i $˘)11.2.1.1 Unconjugated positive formsThis important clitic is used in the ‘it is Y’ construction, identifying or
describing a contextually understood (but unexpressed) referent, which may be
concrete (a person or object) or abstract (e.g. a situation). This may be expanded
into ‘X is Y’, where a subject (or topic) X is further identified or described. The
clitic is essentially a copula, and it is functionally distinct from the ‘be’ quasi-
verbs that are used in existential and locational functions (‘there is X’, ‘X is
[here/there]’). Most often it is unconjugated, though the “unconjugated” form
could be taken as having (zero) 3Sg agreement. This subsection covers positive
unconjugated forms; following subsections present overtly conjugated forms,
and negative counterparts of both types. For the use of the clitic in focalization
constructions, see §13.1.
     The clitic may take the surface forms y$, y$<, i $˘, and i^˘, depending on
what segment the preceding word ends in, whether the nearest consonant to the
left is nasal or nasalized or not, and on what the immediately preceding tone is.
The key allomorphic division is between postvocalic y$ (also used after {y y<})
and postconsonantal i^˘. For the phonology, see §3.6.1.
     The ‘it is Y’ construction is illustrated in (647).(647)   [ç$w<ç$-sa&y< ku$<] [a$-ni^˘          de$y], [a$r<a$-lç$gu@       le$]

        is a woman, the female drum style is what they will go with.’ (a&-n,
        n)E&-n)     In (647), from a general text about mortuary practices, prior discourse has
made it clear that an unspecified person has died. The conditional a$-ni^˘ de$y
might be more fully glossed as ‘if (the situation is that) it is a man’ or ‘in the
event that it is a man’ (French s’il s’agit d’un homme). The relevant passage is
followed by the parallel ‘if (it is the situation that) it is a woman’. There is thus
here, as often (especially in conditional antecedent contexts), an ambiguity as to
whether the copula is predicated of a referential (though unexpressed) entity, or
whether the copula has scope over an entire proposition, which can then be
analysed as a factive complement (‘it’s the case that […]’); see §17.3.

      Further examples of the ‘it is Y’ construction: (392.a) and (499) (‘it’s an
obligation’ = ‘must’ or ‘certainly’), (393) (‘if it’s [=if we’re talking about] the
past’), (452.c) (‘if [the situation is that it’s] in the sauce pot’), (668) in §11.2.2.2
(‘if it’s [=if we’re talking about] (making) ridges’), (975) in §16.1.3 (‘if it’s [=if
we’re talking about] birds’), (976) in §16.1.3 (‘it’s the truth’).
      The ‘X is Y’ construction with two overtly expressed discourse referents is
illustrated in (648). One could argue that the first NP is a presentential topic NP,
in which case ‘X is Y’ is really ‘(as for) X, it is Y’, and the two-NP construction
reduces to the single-NP version described above.(648)     a. ta$ra$-nç$w<ç@           [cE$˘     pç$rba@]y$

   An independent pronoun may be the complement of y$ (649). The clitic

11.2.1.2 Conjugated formsWhen the first argument in the ‘X is Y’ construction is expressed by a noun-
headed NP, one could argue that it is a topic phrase, perhaps pre-sentential.
However, it is possible to conjugate y$ to agree with a subject, showing that
the first argument can in fact be grammatically part of the clause containing the
clitic and the second argument. While y$ is the default form of the clitic, in the

is’ clitic in the 2Pl, 3Sg/Nonhuman (zero suffix), and 3Pl forms. These involve
simple addition of the regular pronominal-subject suffix to the postvocalic
allomorph of the clitic. By contrast, the 1Sg, 2Sg, and (ambiguously) 1Pl forms
are reduced to the segmental form of the pronominal-subject suffix (atonal -m,
-w, -y), but acquire the L-tone of the (segmentally deleted) y$ clitic. Perhaps
the historical driver of this reduction came in the 1Pl, whose original *y$-y$ may
have been the first conjugated clitic to reduce to just a consonant.
     The postconsonantal forms show similar patterns. For the special L-toned
forms used when the preceding word ends in an F-toned syllable, see Clitic
<LHL>-Reduction (155) (§3.7.4.7). The F-toned conjugated clitics used after
other preceding words can be taken as basic. This still leaves us with two
distinct clusters. 3Sg and Nonhuman i^˘ is phonetically identical to the
unconjugated clitic (postconsonantal allomorph), and may be represented as
i^˘-Ø. 3Pl i^˘-ba$ and 2Pl i^˘-be$ simply add (syllabic) pronominal-subject
suffixes to this.
     The other cluster centers around the 1Sg and 2Sg, with 1Pl again
ambiguous. 1Sg u^m could be derived from /i^˘-m/ by amalgamating the tone
of the clitic with the segmental form of the pronominal, hence /m^/. In
postconsonantal position, this requires one further step, an allomorphic vocalic
extension to u^m. Compare postvocalic Sg -n and Pl -m with adjectives, but
postconsonantal -in and -um with -vC shape (§4.1.1). The conjugated 2Sg clitic
likewise is derived as follows: /i^˘-w/ > /w^/ > /u^w/. However, it needs a final
rule, Monophthongization (93) to u@˘, see §3.5.7.2. The 1Pl postconsonantal
form, though homophonous to the unconjugated form (and therefore also to the
406     VP and predicate structure
3Sg and Nonhuman form), can be derived in a manner parallel to that of the 2Sg
form, ending with Monophthongization: /i^˘-y/ > /y^/ > /i^y/.
     It is possible to add a cliticized form of the ‘be’ quasi-verb after y$, instead
of the conjugated forms given above. In practice, this is uncommon, and is
chiefly implemented with 3Sg wç$-Ø, hence …y$wç$-Ø. In effect, this
provides the 3Sg with a conjugated form of y$ that is audibly distinct from the
unconjugated form. See (676) in §11.2.2.3 for y$wç$-Ø.
     The conjugated variants undergo the same tone rules that apply to
unmarked y$. Examples with a&-n ‘man’, i^-n ‘child’, their plurals a$r<-u@m and
u@r<-u$m, the woman’s name pa$nta@ (singular only), and the political-party name
Adema (plural), are in (652).(652)          category ‘man/men’           ‘child/children’ ‘Fanta/Adema’         a.    1Sg       a$nu^m            i@-nu$-m          pa$nta@m$

‘instead of X’, or ‘far from (being) X’. The position of X may be filled by a

for example, ‘eloping’ is not really a truth-conditional subset of ‘tying

no contracting marriage; (there was no marriage) if it was not (=other than)

With nonzero pronominal suffix, both a long-voweled type with la$˘- and a
short-voweled type with la$- are attested.
    Most examples have the short-voweled form la$-. In this construction, the
y$ clitic has the ‘it is’ (copular) function. The clitic may or may not also be
conjugated. In (657), only the Negative morpheme is conjugated.(657)     a$ƒa@     [wo$    de^˘      be@]y$ wo@     o^˘,

conjugated. Since ba^˘< ‘owner’ is vowel-final, the relevant instance of y$ is

proposed version with double 2Pl marking (i.e. with na@mi^˘-be$), suggesting
that double conjugation is somewhat restricted.(659)   [ja@ma@˘y$]   na@mi^˘           la$-be$      ta@n

Negative la$˘ was originally contour-toned. This would account for the long
vowel before zero suffix, and the short vowel before a (moraic) suffix that could
express the second tone component without lengthening the vowel; see
Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141).
     The type with long-voweled la$˘- occurred in elicitation (660). My assistant
consistently pronounced the long vowel, in contrast to the short vowel of the
preceding examples. The ‘it is’ clitic itself is not conjugated here. I suggest that
the difference between the two constructions is that in the long-voweled type,
the clitic y$ is the Focus marker (or perhaps jointly ‘it is’ and Focus).(660)   a. tç@˘w<ç@y$<         la$˘-be$       de$y

on sa$y (L-toned variant of sa&y ‘only’). If y$ were present, we would get sa&yy$,
and the Negative would be long-voweled la$˘, as in (655.b), above.
    L-toned la$ is perhaps identical morphemically to Negative la@- with statives
(§11.4.3), rather than to the long-voweled la$˘ found after y$. If so, the tone-
dropping is due to predicate defocalization, as is reasonable after a (naturally
focal) ‘only’ phrase.","[424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432]"

19.5.2 Clause-final ko$yThis particle is added to the end of a sentence as a mild emphatic. Similar forms

particle wa precedes ko$y. The result is therefore [S1 wa ko$y], where S1 is the
basic proposition in the original utterance. An example is (1003).

zone, and is even used in local French. It seems less common in Jamsay, where
it may be a fairly recent borrowing.
    In (1175.a), the speaker responds with a trace of irritation to a vague
question about what kinds of song-and-dance festivities there are. In (1175.b),
the negation is emphatic.(1175) a. dç$ƒç$-cE$r<E$w<E@   ma$ si^˘      ji -$ jo^˘                de@

19.5.4 Clause-final ‘(not) at all!’ particles (pE@y, so@y, fE@s)Various clause-final emphatic particles, pronounced as interjections, occur in
emphatic negatives like (1176).(1176) be@           [gu$ju@-jE@mu$˘               de$y],

       ‘They (=Algerians) [topic], if you-Sg are a black-skinned person (=an
       African), your situation (=behavior) is not at all important to them.’
       (gu$ju@-jE^m [bahuvrihi], be$-ru@) 2004.5.4     This is the only occurrence of pE@y in my recorded texts, though I have
heard it in conversation. Elicitation brought out two other particles with similar
’(not) at all’ uses, fE@s and so@y. For so@y, whose more general sense is ‘all,
entirely’, see cf. §8.5.8.7.
     fE@s is unusual in ending in a sibilant, a possibility restricted to interjections
(and poorly integrated borrowings). fE@s itself resembles ‘(not) at all’ particles in
some other languages of the region (e.g. Humburi Senni).
680   Grammatical pragmatics
19.5.4.1 Emphatic construction with verb plus topicalized related nominalThis construction has truth-value emphatic function, as when an assertion is
reaffirmed to a skeptical audience, or when someone lays down the law to a
child or other subordinate about what will or will not happen. The discourse
flavor can be approximated by adding ‘sure as hell’ or the like to the free
translation.
    A nominal related to the verb (perhaps a Verbal Noun) is followed by
Topicalizing particle kE@ (§19.1.1), then the inflected verb form (1177.a-b).
There is no prosodic break between the “topical” phrase and the verb,
suggesting that the topical constituent is clause-internal. Where both a Verbal
Noun and another cognate nominal are available, either may be used (1177.c-d).
For verbs like ‘fight’ that are regularly accompanied by a cognate nominal, my
assistant did not accept a proposed version where the cognate nominal and the
Verbal noun (i.e. as a compound Verbal Noun) both occurred (1177.e).(1177) a. [da&g-Ø             ke@]    da$ƒa$-j-e@

uptake checks, where the speaker tests whether the listener is paying attention,
or whether uptake of a difficult passage has occurred.
    As in all local languages, expressions of the general type ‘did you (not)
understand?’ are frequently used by some speakers. The listener is expected to
respond in some way, at least by gesture or grunt. In texts from an older man,
such forms as (1179) were common.(1179) pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w<                 la$˘
       understand-Habit-2SgS           Neg
       ‘Is it not (the case) that you-Sg understand?’     In this pronunciation, pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w< is a slightly irregular variant of
pa@˘m-a@˘r<a$-w<.
     Another backchannel checking phrase, used by a different speaker
occasionally in a long recording, was (1180).(1180) ga$˘-lu@-m
       say-PerfNeg-1SgS
       ‘I did not say …’ (= ‘Did I not say …?’)    In (1180), the preceding discourse is taken retrospectively as a quotative
complement. Though there is no overt marker of interrogative status, (1180) is
evidently interrogative in function: ‘did I not say (…)?’
19.7 GreetingsA greeting sequence begins with an expression relevant to a given time of day
(good morning, good evening, etc.), or to an activity that the initial addressee is
engaged in or returning from (in a field, at a well, at work, arriving at a house,
etc.). The ABAB… sequence is initially asymmetrical (with “adjacency pairs”
consisting of a greeting and a well-defined response) but then may blur into a
symmetrical interaction where essentially the same highly general greetings are
exchanged. ta$˘re@ is used to bring a sequence (or sub-sequence) to an end, but
this may lead to a relaunch of the greeting cycle.
     (1181-2) are examples of morning greeting sequences.","[700, 701, 702, 703]"

10.1.3 Negation of indicative verbs10.1.3.1 Categories expressed by negative verbsIn both perfective and imperfective systems, there is a clear tendency to reduce
the relatively complex system of positive AN categories to just two in the
negative.
     Perfective Negative -li@- replaces several positive forms: unsuffixed and
marked Perfective, Resultative, and (for the most part) the reduplicated Per-
fective and the Recent Perfective. Rarely, -li@- is added directly to a reduplicated
Perfective, or to Recent Perfect -jE$-. The only AN suffix that is regularly
retained before -li@- is Experiential Perfect -tE@rE$- ; the combination is pro-
nounced -tE$-li@- for expected #-tE$l-li@- (§10.1.3.2).
     Imperfective Negative -go@- replaces the unsuffixed Imperfective and the
reduplicated Imperfective. It also normally replaces the marked Imperfective
and the Habitual; alternatively, their positive forms are directly followed by
stative Negative -la@- (§11.4.3).(578)     a. perfective system (negative)              common:

§11.4.3. For la$˘ as Negative morpheme after y$ ‘it is’, see §11.2.1.3.
     ‘Be sick’ is regularly expressed as the negation of ‘be healthy’ (sE@llE@-), as
in sE$llE$-lu@˘-Ø ‘you-Sg are sick’.
     Although the negative morpheme appears with the verb at the extreme right
of the clause, it typically has wide scope. In (580), for example, ç@ƒç@rç@ ‘quickly’
is under the scope of the negation.

negation has narrow scope. See §6.8.2 for examples and further discussion of
interactions between negative and quantificational operators.","[388, 389, 390]"

11.4.3 Negative adjectival and stative predicates (-la@-)The usual negative counterpart of kç$ and wç$- in adjectival predicates is -la@-,
which (like other Negative inflectional suffixes) induces tone-dropping on the
preceding stem. The ‘be’ quasi-verb is omitted.(710)   a. e$l-la@-Ø

              ‘The kinds are not the same.’ (tu@ru@) 2004.3.27      This Negative -la@- should be distinguished from 3Pl Perfective Negative
-l-a@ (arguably contracted from /-li@-ba@/). It is also distinct from la$˘, a higher-
level Negative used after clitic y$ ‘it is’ (§11.2.1.3).
      -la@- is also used as an aspectually undifferentiated Negative suffix for
imperfective-system verbs, when added to a verb already suffixed with -tç@ƒç$-
(marked Imperfective) or -a@˘ra$- (Habitual); see (586-7) in §10.1.3.4. It is also
the only Negative suffix for stative stance verbs (‘be sitting’, ‘be standing’, ‘be
lying down’), see (694) and (695.d) in §11.2.4. Similarly, it is the only Negative
suffix for defective ‘have’ verbs ji n $ e$- and je$re$-, see (717.a-b) and (718.c) in
§11.5.2).
      For adverbials, which only rarely take other than Nonhuman subject, the
usual negation is formed with kç$˘-rç@ ‘it is not’, as in (711.a). With adjectives,
this construction was elicitable, as with wç$˘-rç@- in (711.b) but did not occur
spontaneously. Either kç$˘-rç@ or wç$˘-rç@- may drop tones, suggesting that they
may be defocalized (a phenomenon associated with the unsuffixed Perfective of
verbs).(711)      a. de@m         kç$˘-rç@                [or: kç$˘-rç$]

              ‘I am not small.’
11.5 Possessive predicates11.5.1     ‘Have’ (sa$-)This is another defective verb. It should be distinguished from the regular verb
sa@˘- ‘reply’, which has a long vowel. In positive main clauses, ‘have’ occurs
only in the unsuffixed Perfective stem sa$-, and I cite it in this form. An
                                                 11.5 Possessive predicates   435H-toned form sa@- is arguably lexically basic, though it actually occurs as such
only in lexical-stem pseudo-participial sa@-n (§3.7.1.1, §15.1.1.3).
    In simple possessive predications of the type ‘X have Y’, we have a straight
transitive construction with the possessor as subject and the possessed entity as
direct object. In positive sentences, Existential yE@ is present, preceding sa$-.
Examples of such ‘X have Y’ clauses are (295.a) and (486) among many others.
    ‘Have’ is used as an inflectable auxiliary with a number of nouns (often of
Fulfulde or other foreign origin) that denote states or qualities. Thus ‘have
nastiness’ = ‘be nasty’ and so forth. The cases in (712) show yE@ as in canonical
possessive predicates.(712)   a. tç@˘kE$      yE@     sa$-Ø
           nastiness exist have-3SgS
           ‘It (=viper) has nastiness (=is nasty/dangerous)’.        b. ya@˘gE$  yE@       sa$-Ø

           ‘With spiders, it (=insecticide) has value (=is valuable/useful).’
           2004.3.8     Similar phrasing is seen in (424) (‘have health’) and (713.a-b), below.
     The Participial stem of sa$- is sa^-, with the usual H(H…)L overlaid
perfective tone. With zero (Nonhuman) suffix, Contour-Tone Mora-Addition
(141) applies, lengthening the vowel to two moras: sa^˘-Ø. Other forms are
human Sg sa^-n (430) or sa@n-i n  $ (653.c), and Pl sa^-m (713.b) or sa@n-u$m. In
sa@n-i n
       $ and sa@n-u$m variants, the n of sa^-n has been secondarily incorporated
into the stem.(713)   a. i $jE$        pa$Na@    sa^˘-Ø

it competes with ‘owner of X’ compounds (§5.1.12). The 3Sg subject form
sa$˘-ra@-Ø can be used idiomatically, with a preceding main-like clause (i.e.
factive complement), in the sense ‘it doesn’t matter (much) that’; see §17.3.5.
The combination of -sa$˘-ra@ with a preceding nominal stem forms occasional
compounds of the general meaning ‘lack of X’ (§5.1.4).
     No causative or pseudo-causative forms could be elicited of positive sa$- or
its negative counterpart.","[455, 456, 457, 458]"

licated Perfective, there is a single unreduplicated Perfective Negative form
with suffix -li@-. There are some phonological interactions with pronominal-
subject suffixes (e.g. 2Sg -lu@˘-Ø, 1Pl -li@˘-Ø, 3Pl -l-a@, 1Sg -lu@-m, see §10.2.3,
below). The verb stem drops its tones to all-L.
     Examples of positive/negative correspondences are in (581). When the
negative verb is defocalized, for example in the presence of a focalized
constituent, tone-dropping applies, changing -li@- to -li $- (581.d).(581)          positive                     negative          a.   ya&˘-yE$-Ø                   ya$˘-li@-Ø

suffix (‘have you already searched’), where parallelism between the question
and the response is called for. In other contexts, ‘I have not searched’ would
appear in simple Perfective Negative form as lu$gu$ro$-lu@-m ‘I did not search’.
     PerfNeg -li@- does combine readily with the Experiental Perfect (‘have not
ever’). This is the usual way to express ‘never’. Here the Experiential Perfect
suffix -tE@rE$- is truncated to -tE- before -li@-, resulting in -tE$-li@-. The PerfNeg
suffix forces L-tone on both the ExpPf suffix and the preceding verb stem. The
irregularity in the form of -E@˘- ‘see’ with ExpPf suffix in the positive (E@t-tE@rE@-
instead of #E@˘-tE@rE@-) is carried over into the negative.(583)   positive                            negative        E@t-tE@rE$-w ‘you-Sg have seen’     E$t-tE$-lu@˘-Ø ‘you have never seen’

10.1.3.3 Negation of reduplicated perfective-system verbsReduplicated perfectives cannot normally be directly negated.
     A reduplicated Perfective of a stative stance verb, e.g. i $-i@jE$- ‘be standing’,
is negated by adding the usual stative Negative suffix -la@- to the unreduplicated
stem, as in i j$ E$-la@-ba@ ‘they are not standing’. Likewise with adjectival verbs,
e.g. reduplicated positive ji -$ jo^˘- ‘be many’, negative jo$˘-la@- ‘not be many’.
     A reduplicated Perfective of an active verb, e.g. ti -$ tE@mE$-w< ‘you-Sg
found’, normally has a simple (unreduplicated) Perfective Negative counterpart:
tE$mE$-lu@˘-Ø ‘you-Sg did not find’. However, in parallelistic positive-negative
sequences, a reduplicated Perfective Negative is possible.
     For reduplicated Perfective ci -$ ce@˘ne$- ‘be well done, be good’, the normal
negative counterpart is the simple, unreduplicated Perfective Negative, as in
ce$˘ne$-li@-Ø ‘it is not well done, it is not good’. However, for this verb there is
also a parallelistic positive-negative construction, functioning as a “willy-nilly”
conditional antecedent (§16.3), that adds L-toned Negative -li $- to the
reduplicated Perfective stem (with no tone-dropping).

12.2.2 ‘(Not) particularly’ (-la$ƒa@)A construction of the type [ADJx-la$ƒa@ ADJx-Neg] is used with adjectives to
mean ‘it’s not very (not particularly) ADJ’. There is no overt comparandum,
and the construction merely emphasizes that the entity in question is only
moderately characterized by the quality. -la$ƒa@ is invariant, while the negated
second adjective may be conjugated. Since it is part of a bipartite construction,
it is difficult to gloss -la$ƒa@ precisely; I use ‘so.much’ in interlinears.(739)    a. gu$l-la$ƒa@          gu$l-la@-Ø

rejected a direct identification.2.4
12.2.3 ‘Equal; be as good as’ (ba&˘-)ba&˘- can function as a transitive verb meaning ‘suffice, be enough for (sb)’, in a
full range of perfective and imperfective forms: mi@ ba&˘kç$ ‘it’s enough for me’,
mi@ ba$˘-go@-Ø ‘it isn’t enough for me.’
     A homophone (or specialized offshoot) of this verb is used in comparatives,
in the perfective system only, in the sense ‘be as much as, equal’. It competes
with dç@˘- (do@˘-) ‘approach, attain’ in this sense; see §12.2.4, below. Unlike the
quasi-verbs and other stative verbs that are confined to the perfective system,
ba&˘- takes regular perfective system suffixes, including Resultative -sa$- and
Perfective Negative -li@- (rather than stative Negative -la@-). However, the
perfective forms are used for any time frame, and no morphologically
imperfective forms occur. For example, Imperfective Negative #ba$˘-go@- (in the
relevant sense) was rejected.
     ba&˘ may be chained to a following VP that expresses the substance of the
comparison. In the absence of such a VP, the default interpretation is ‘be as
good as’. In most examples, ba&˘ occurs in negative clauses (‘not equal X’ =
‘be/do less than X’), but it may occur in positive clauses as well (740.d).

13 Focalization and interrogation
13.1 FocalizationFocalization is a fundamental process in Jamsay morphosyntax, but it is
somewhat elusive. In the usual case, an NP or adverbial is highlighted
(focused), whereupon the remainder of the clause and in particular the verb is
automatically defocalized. I distinguish a marked focalization construction
from an unmarked one, based on the form of the highlighted constituent itself.
     In both marked and unmarked constructions, verbs in the perfective positive
appear in the unsuffixed Perfective form, with stem-wide L-tone, rather than in
a form with overt Perfective suffix. Perfective Negative and the Imperfective
Negative verbs also show stem-wide L-tone (including the AN suffix) in
focalization constructions. This tone-dropping may be interpreted iconically as
a prosodic manifestation of verb defocalization. No tone-dropping applies to
the unmarked Imperfective, or to any verb with overt positive AN suffixation.
     In subject focalization, there is no pronominal-subject suffix on the verb
(the subject is always expressed overtly earlier in the sentence). In all types of
non-subject focalization, the usual pronominal-subject suffix appears on the
verb.
     In the marked construction, in addition to the aforementioned defoc-
alization of perfective verbs, the focalized constituent hosts the Focus clitic y$,
or its allomorph i $˘ (sometimes i^˘ after tone sandhi). This clitic is also added
to NPs and other constituents in the ‘it is’ (i.e., copula) construction (§11.2.1).
As a result, the marked focalization construction resembles English clefts of the
type ‘it’s you (e.g. not that other woman) that I love’.
     In the unmarked construction, we get the verb defocalization described
above, and there is a focal constituent (e.g. ci@n ‘like that’), but the latter is not
overtly marked with the clitic y$.
     Since verb defocalization has audible effects on the stem only with per-
fective and negative verbs, and since the 3Sg pronominal-subject suffix is -Ø,
the unmarked focalization construction is indistinguishable from unfocalized
clauses when the verb is imperfective positive and the subject is 3Sg.
     Quite often in Jamsay discourse, a topic is presented first, followed by
sentence containing a pronominalized or otherwise reduced variant thereof in
focalized form. Schematic examples to give the flavor of this strategy: a) ‘meat,
that’s what I like’, b) ‘we sow seeds early, that’s how we farm’. Real examples
are in (744). In (744.a), the parallel segments are aligned. Note the absence of
                                                            13.1 Focalization   455pronominal-subject marking (3Pl -ba$) on the defocalized verbs in the subject-
focus example (744.a), and the presence of a pronominal-subject suffix (1Sg

13.1.1 Focalization of complement of y$ ‘it is’Although Focus clitic y$ is, to all appearances, morphologically identical to the
‘it is …’ form y$ (§11.2.1), it is possible for the two to co-occur. Compare the
ungrammaticality of English #It’s meat [focus] that it is, in contrast to the
grammatical Meat [focus] is what it is. In (745), the focused constituent is the
complement of the preposition ‘in’. The entire PP is the complement of the
external y$ ‘it is/was’. The construction is rare, but my assistant found it
grammatical.(745)   [ja@ma^˘y$     bE@rE$]y$        ta$Na$-Ø

13.1.2 Subject focalizationIn subject focalization, there is no subject pronominal suffix on the verb.
There is also no participial suffix of the sort found in relative clauses. This lack
of suffixation is a useful diagnostic, except for 3Sg subject which has -Ø suffix
anyway. The subject X is always overtly expressed earlier in the clause, either
as unmarked [X] or in the form [Xy$] with the Focus clitic. If the subject is
pronominal, it appears in preverbal position in its H-toned independent form,

13.1.8 Focalization and negationClause-internal negation is compatible with focalization, as long as the negative
has narrow scope.(757)     ni $mi^˘       de$ne$-go@-m
          cow.peasFoc want-ImpfNeg-1SgS
          ‘Cow-peas are what I don’t want.’    In contexts like that of the first clause of (758), however, a simple negative
clause without focalization is used, even though it is parallel to a following
positive focalized clause.(758)     ni&m         de$ne$-go@-m,           nç$w<ç@y$<     de$ne@-m$
          cow.peas want-ImpfNeg-1SgS, meatFoc                 want.Impf-1SgS

          (= ‘It isn’t cow-peas [focus] that I want, it’s meat [focus] that I want.’)
13.2 InterrogativesPolar interrogatives are formed by adding a particle (arguably identical to the
‘or’ disjunctive particle) to the end of a statement. Other interrogatives are

focalized by Focus clitic y$ (or variant).","[482, 483]"

10.1.3.4 Negation of imperfective-system verbsCorresponding to the unsuffixed Imperfective in all its functions, there is an
Imperfective Negative form with suffix -go@-, possibly related historically to
go@˘- ‘exit, go out’.(585)     positive                        negative          de$ne@-m$ ‘I want’              de$ne$-go@-m ‘I don’t want’
          sa^˘-Ø ‘it will respond’        sa$˘-go@-Ø ‘it will not respond’      -go@- is also the usual negation corresponding to morphologically marked
positive forms of the imperfective system, namely the Habitual in -a@˘ra$-, the
marked Imperfective in -tç@ƒç$-, and the reduplicated Imperfective. However,
-a@˘ra$- and -tç@ƒç$- may also be followed directly by (stative) Negative -la@-
(§11.4.3), with no tone-dropping of the stem or of the inner AN suffix. This
suggests that -la@- in this combination is phonologically peripheral to the
preceding stem, unlike the case with other AN suffixes. See also discussion of
(587), below.
      -a@˘ra$-la@- optionally syncopates (and undergoes Rhotic Assimilation (77)) to
-a^˘l-la@-.
                           10.2 Pronominal paradigms for non-imperative verbs        371(586)   positive                            negative        bi r$ -a@˘ra$-m ‘I work’        bi r$ -a@˘ra$-la@-m ‘I don’t usually work’
                                     [variant bi r$ -a^˘l-la@-m]
        ya&˘-tç@ƒç$-m ‘I go (often)’    ya&˘-tç@ƒç$-la@-m ‘I do not go (often)’     A textual example of -a@˘ra$-la@- is (587), in a subject relative clause. The
syncopated variant of be@˘-ra$-la$-Ø would be be^˘l-la$-Ø. Negative -la@- in (587)
drops its tone to -la$- under the influence of the following ka^˘< ‘any’ (§14.1.3).
Note that when VERB-a@˘ra$-la@- undergoes tone-dropping imposed by a
following word, only Negative -la@- actually drops its tones, while the stem and
the inner AN suffix -a@˘ra$- retain their tones. This reinforces the view that -la@- in
this construction is phonologically peripheral to the stem.(587)   [ko@      bE$rE^˘] [cE$˘     be@˘-ra$-la$-Ø                   ka^˘<]

        ‘In that domain (=legal disputes), there is nothing that doesn’t happen
        (=i.e., anything can happen)’ 2004.3.10
10.2 Pronominal paradigms for non-imperative verbs10.2.1 Subject pronominal suffixesThe pronominal-subject suffixes (§4.3) are repeated here. They have no intrinsic
tones except for the Nonhuman clitics used only in the positive unsuffixed
Imperfective.","[392, 393]"

1 Introduction
1.1   Dogon languagesDogon is a family of languages spoken principally in eastern Mali, though some
Dogon groups have spread across the border into Burkina Faso. As a whole, the
family belongs to the vast Niger-Congo phylum, but its precise position relative
to other Niger-Congo families (e.g. Mande, Gur) is very unclear at this point.
The internal structure of the Dogon family is also very unclear, as is the number
of mutually unintelligible languages it contains.
     The French colonial administration, having little interest in small native
languages, favored (macro-)ethnic over (precise) linguistic classification, hence
“Dogon” rather than e.g. “Jamsay,” and labeled linguistic varieties within each
such macro-ethnicity as “dialects,” a tradition maintained even in current
Francophone scholarship. For similar reasons, (macro-)ethnic classification
suits African governments fine. The official language policy in Mali, for
example, is to equate “language” with (macro-)ethnicity, select the linguistic
variety spoken in a particular focal community as standard, develop pedagogical
materials in this variety, and teach it as “mother tongue” to schoolchildren and
interested adults everywhere who belong to this ethnicity. In the case of Dogon,
the Toro-So variety of the Sanga area was chosen as standard Dogon and is the
basis of government-approved literacy efforts in the region.
     Using the test of mutual unintelligibility as diagnostic, on the other hand,
there are clearly many distinct Dogon languages in Mali. We do not yet have
Dogon-wide data in a form that would permit demarcation of language
boundaries and accurate genetic subgroupings. However, having surveyed the
varieties spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of Dogon country, I can
report the following as distinct languages, using the towns of Dountza and Boni
(primarily Fulfulde-speaking) and Koro (Dogon and Mossi) as geographical
reference points:
1. Jamsay (aka Diamsay), see below;
2. Beni, spoken in Beni and Gamni south of Dianwely Maoudé, and in
Kumboy village hugging Fombori mountain between Beni and Douentza;
3. Walo, close genetically to Beni, spoken in Walo at the western end of the
long Gandamiya inselberg (on the opposite side of which is Kikara, where the
Songhay language Tondi Songway Kiini is spoken);
4. Nanga (naNa), spoken in a village cluster including Anda, Soroni,
Namakoro, Wakara, and Kono southwest of Beni and broadly east of the
2 IntroductionTommo-So (Tombo-So) speaking zone that begins at Kasa and extends to
Bandiagara;
5. Tabi-Sarinyere, spoken by the people sometimes called Tandam, east of the
town Boni (which is just off the highway, between Douentza and Hombori), in
several villages ringing the widely separated inselbergs of Tabi and Sarinyere,
plus a few small villages and one substantial one (Koyo) on the two inselbergs
framing Boni itself;
6. Najamba (= Bondu), spoken in a cluster of villages west and southwest of
Douentza including Koubewel, Adia.
     After the initial failure of government-supported instruction in Toro-So in
Dogon villages of the Douentza-Boni zone, local groups have launched literacy
programs in Jamsay and Bondu and these are now being taught in primary
schools. Aside from its own mother-tongue villages, Jamsay is being taught in
the Tabi area (whose people have long known Jamsay as a second language,
since Mondoro is not far away). The children of Beni have been attending
school in Jamsay-speaking Dianwely Maoudé, where Jamsay is of course used,
pending the construction of its own school. Jamsay is slowly acquiring the

14.1.13 H(H…L) unsuffixed Perfective participle in relative clauseAs the preceding sections have shown, the verb preceding a Participial suffix
has the same form (including tone contour) that it has in main clauses
(preceding a subject pronominal suffix), across a wide range of positive and
negative AN categories.
    However, in the positive perfective, the unsuffixed Perfective is almost
always used in participles instead of the suffixally marked Perfective (with
suffix -ti $-, -ya$-/-yE$-, or -a^˘-). Moreover, the unsuffixed Perfective takes a
special form in participles (i.e. in relative clauses), characterized by an
498     Relativization
H(H… … )L tonal overlay (829). (This contour is also found in relative clauses
and some other subordinated clauses (829).","[517, 518, 519, 520]"

16.2 Alternative ‘if’ particles (cc E^ w, ta@ n , k a^ ˘ <)Alternatively, a particle other than dey can be used. The forms regularly used in
this way are listed in (980).(980)    a.. cE^w            ‘all, entirely’         b. ta@n             ‘only’ (<Fulfulde)         c. ka^˘<            ‘even’
            ka^˘< nE$        ‘also, too’     The nuances are only slightly different from those with dey. cE^w ‘all,
entirely’ is a strong ending for a clause (or sequence of connected clauses), and
is therefore a good boundary marker to separate the antecedent from the
consequent in a structurally complex conditional. The use of ‘all’ in con-
ditionals is a regional phenomenon; it is certainly widespread in Songhay
languages.(981)    ç$ƒç&-n      ni $-di^˘< ye&y-ya$-Ø                de$y,     gç@r<ç$

universal quantifier, fu@˘, is rarely used in this construction, but it is attested as
such in (165).
     ta@n, a Fulfulde borrowing, is confined to use in conditionals. This is not the
usual ‘only’ particle in Jamsay, see sa&y ‘only’ in §19.4.1. The construction [S1
ta@n, S2] suggests that the fulfillment of the antecedent eventuality leads
immediately to that of the consequent. A translation like ‘as soon as’ is
appropriate in some contexts.(982)     i@ne@-m      yE$rE@   mç&y<-y<E$-ba$              ta@n, …

S2’, stating that the eventuality S2 will occur in spite of, rather than because of,
the fulfillment of the eventuality in S1. For other uses of ka^˘< ‘also, too, even’,
see §19.1.3. This particle is distinct from homophone ka^˘< ‘each, any’.(983)     a. ta$ra@             ku$<      ya$˘-go@-w          ka^˘<

‘be good’ and its unusual negative counterpart ci -$ ce@˘ne$-li $-, see §10.1.2.7.
    In (986), fu@˘ ‘all’ at the end of a manner adverbial implies an unexpressed
disjunctive antecedent (‘regardless of whether …’). The context involves
someone who flees the area to avoid paying an indemnity and comes back only
years later.(986)   da$ƒa$-lu@˘-Ø             de@y ka^˘<     nE$,

19.4   ‘Only’ particles19.4.1 ‘Only’ (sa&y)The regular ‘only’ particle is sa&y, following the relevant constituent. The R-tone
is often dropped to L-tone, especially in prepausal position; this is similar to
what happens with R-toned numerals like le&y ‘two’. The R-tone, however, is
audible in (1160.a-b).(1169) a. [i@˘r<e@  le$    sa&y]     ko@         bi $rE^˘-Ø

and right conjuncts, and it may therefore carry the special prosodic lengthening
and F-tone associated with conjunction (1170).(1170) [be@     sa&y],   [be@      n)a˘$ -ba$˘n)a@      sa&y]

       ‘Just them and their eating bowls.’    sa&y is not as common in texts as ‘only’ forms in many other languages,
since it gets stiff competition from an explicitly or implicitly double-negative
construction including y$ la$˘ de$y (§11.2.1.3, §16.4). This means literally ‘if it
is not X’, but can extend to ‘unless it is X’ (i.e., ‘except X’, ‘other than X’), and
with implied by unexpressed double-negative ‘(nothing) unless it is X’, which is
equivalent to ‘only (=exclusively) X’.

11.2.2.2 Locational quasi-verbs (wç$- or kç$, usually without yE@)To indicate that an entity is present in some location, one may use the quasi-
verbs whose inflected forms are given in (665). The quasi-verb wç$-, which
takes subject suffixes for the full range of human referents, is formally an
unsuffixed Perfective in defocalized L-tone form. This could be taken as
evidence that the accompanying locational expression is treated as focal, even in
the absence of a Focus clitic. Suffixally marked forms of the (positive)
perfective system (-ti -$ , -sa$-, -a^˘-, -jE$-, -tE@rE$-) are not possible. Imperfectives are
extremely rare, only a single instance of wç@˘-tç@ƒç$- occurring in my textual
corpus; see (685) in §11.2.2.5, below.(665)             category       form         a.       1Sg            wç$-m

form wç$-Ø. Animals as well as plants and inanimates and abstractives require
kç$ (except where animals are personified in tales). I gloss kç$ as ‘be.Nonh’, and
wç$- as ‘be.Hum’ in interlinears, since the nonhuman/human opposition is sharp
here. Indeed, there is a striking resemblance between wç$- and kç$, on the one
hand, and the pronouns wo@ (human 3Sg) and ko@ (Nonhuman).
     An H-toned form wç@- for the human quasi-verb is arguably lexically basic,
though it actually occurs as such only in lexical-stem pseudo-participial wç@-n
(§3.7.1.1, §15.1.1.3).
     Examples, illustrating the regular use of these forms with overt locational
expressions, and without yç@, are in (666).(666)     a. du@wa@n       wç$-m

           ‘what is there (=exists)?’    The locational ‘be’ quasi-verbs may be stretched to take adverbial
complements that are not literally locational. In (668), the reference is to fields
with mounds in rows, rather than with long furrows bounded by ridges.
Postposition le$ can mean ‘in’ or ‘with’ (§8.2.1)(668)   [nu$mo@ ma$ wç$-tu@mo@]y$< de$y ju$go@-w$]

        makes a continuous furrow).’ 2004.3.7    Relative-clause examples with H(H…)L tone, as usual for unsuffixed
Perfective verbs, are in (669). In the absence of a nonzero subject suffix, the
vowel of wç$- or kç$ must be lengthened (Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141)) to
accomodate the contour tone.

locational ‘be’ and existential ‘be’ is neutralized in relatives.

          ‘Last year he was here.’     For specifically future time reference, an alternative expression must be
used, e.g. with a regular verb like tE@mE@-w<E@- ‘be found’.
     A preceding Existential yE@, in the assimilated form yç@, is sometimes present
in locational function (671). However, the combinations yç@wç$- and especially
yç@kç$ are more systematically used in existential function. There is, moreover,
evidence that yç@ (i.e. yE@) is associated with the absence of a focalized preverbal
constituent (§11.2.2.1). Since wç$- and kç$ as ‘be’ quasi-verbs are already in
unsuffixed Perfective form (which is used for other verbs in focalization
constructions), they cannot otherwise change in form to reflect the presence of a
focalized constituent.(671)     a. u@ro$            yç@wç$-m

they follow adjective stems in adjectival predicates (§11.4.1, below). They can
also be used with numerical predicates, as in (672).(672)   e@       [n)E-& m      na&y<]           wç$-be$     de$y,

11.2.2.3 Cliticized wç$- or kç$ after inflected verb or ‘it is’ cliticOccasionally, cliticized wç$- or kç$ is found after an inflected verb. A
distinction must be made between constructions where the verb is inflected only
for a marked AN category, and those where the verb has both AN (even if zero)
and pronominal-subject inflection. The distinction is not audible for 3Sg
subject.
     Where a verb allows both active and resultative-stative interpretations of the
Perfective, the resultative-stative sense verb may be guaranteed by adding wç$-
‘be’ (or nonhuman kç$). Compare (673.a) with (673.b). The latter has double
pronominal-subject inflection.(673)   a. i@j-a^˘-m

           ‘I am already standing.’    wç$- or kç$ (or reduplicated variant) may also be used after a marked
Imperfective verb with suffix -tç@ƒç$- (§10.1.2.10). In this combination, only the
‘be’ quasi-verb has pronominal-subject inflection (674). The addition of the
‘be’ quasi-verb emphasizes prolongation of the activity. (674.a) has Ci $-

function here, but the possibility cannot be excluded. In (677), focalization is
present (ci@n ‘thus’ is commonly focalized). I therefore do not consider (677)

‘have’ (positive -sa$-, negative sa$˘-ra@-, §11.5.1). These quasi-verbs are limited to
the perfective system, so they allow no morphological distinction between
Perfective Negative and Imperfective Negative. In this respect they are like
adjectival predicates, which have a single Negative (not marked for aspect) -la@-.
The phonological similarity between -rv@- and -la@- is historically suggestive.
Examples are in (679).(679)     a. [a$na@      bE@rE$]    a$r<-u@m         kç$˘-rç@
             [village    in]        man-Pl           be.Nonh-Neg

             child-Pl    here         be.Hum-Neg-3PlS
             ‘The children are not here.’    kç$˘-rç@ in particular is very common in double negations of the type ‘any
place that he didn’t go, it doesn’t exist’ = ‘he went everywhere’. In this
construction, kç$˘-rç@ is usually generalized to human as well as nonhuman
reference: ‘anyone who didn’t go, he/it doesn’t exist (kç$˘-rç@)’ = ‘everyone
went’. See §14.1.2.
    There is no causative of wç$- or kç$ in any sense.","[434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"

15.1.12 Adverb-like chained verbsChaining lends itself to adverb-like modification. Examples of verbs commonly
used in this function are ç@gç@-rç@ ‘be fast, do fast’ and pi@li@we@- ‘go back; do
again’.(892)     a. pi@li@we@  [ç$yç@     nE$]    tç@ƒç@kç$
             go.back [grass        now] sprout.Impfbe.Nonh

             ‘if you-Sg want it (wall under construction) to reach (its endpoint)
             quickly’ 2004.3.25     Another example is with ja$ma@- ‘betray’, which may be glossed adverbially
as ‘treacherously’ in (893).(893)     [da$˘ƒa@ dE@˘-yE$-Ø   de$y] yE$rE@ ja$ma@ lE@jE@-sa$-Ø       de$y

of cases, there is no difficulty in determining the scope of the negation. If only
the last VP is under negation, a loose chain with me$y< may be used, hence
[VP1 me$y<, VP2-Neg] as in (894).(894)   [na$Na@ E@wE@    me$y<] bu@˘du$    sa$˘-ra@-m
        [cow      buy    and] money        have-Neg-1SgS
        ‘I bought a cow and have no money (left)’   If the negation has wide scope, a simple chain ending in one negative verb
may be used (895).(895)   ni -$ di^˘< nu@˘   di $Ne$-j-e$                      a$ba@da@
        here        enter sit.down-ImpfNeg-3PlS.L            never
        ‘They never come in and sit down here.’     If only the first (or some other nonfinal) VP is negated, there is a
(somewhat cumbersome) way of chaining the clauses using ka@r<a@ me$y< ‘doing’
after a negated verb; see (901.a-c), below. When verbs or VPs are directly
chained without me$y<, the negation most often has wide scope. However,
consider (896).(896)   [d i&˘<   ku$<],     [[i@ne@-n         le$] ja$Na@ me$y<,
        [place Def]          [[person-Sg Dat]       ask    and,

        1PlO        bring        put-PerfNeg-3PlS]
        ‘They (=people of Perge village) didn’t ask anyone and bring and settle
        us (here).’ (i.e., they brought us here to settle without asking anyone
        else for permission) 2004.3.11 [excerpt from (1113.b)]    We can boil this down structurally to the sequence of two VPs followed by
a full clause: [[anyone ask] [us bring] [(us) put-3Pl-Neg]]. The three verbs are
‘ask’, ‘bring’, and ‘put’, with only ‘put’ inflected for negation (and 3Pl subject).
However, the context makes it clear that the bringing and the putting did occur,
while the asking did not. In English, this is best expressed with without in the
negated VP. In the absence of a clause-level ‘without’ construction, the speaker
negated the final verb in the chain, leaving it to the listener to apply contextual
knowledge to piece together the sense. The same text includes other verb-chain
negations of the same type, in the same context (i.e. not first getting permission
before settling). See (907.d) in §15.1.16, below, with linker ti@ rather than me$y<.
532     Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clauses
     (897.a-b) are further examples. The agent does chase or look for, but fails to
catch or find. Therefore the scope of negation is essentially limited to the final
verb ‘reach’ and does not extend to ‘chase’. However, a wide-scope negation
interpretation ([Neg [chase and reach]]) is also logically possible if ‘chase and
reach’ is thought of as a coalesced event type.(897)     a. i $ju@ cE$˘   na$na@ do$˘-go@-Ø                ku$<

             ‘what I looked for and (=but) did not find’ (bE$rE@-)     In (898), what is negated is not one or other of the component eventualities,
rather a particular chronological sequence. In the tale, Crane is offered a chance
to eat, but refuses to eat until after it has gone on a mission and come back.
Note the Recent Perfect -jE$ on the chained verb. As in previous examples, only
the final verb is morphologically negated. (The final wa$ is the hearsay quotative
common in tales.)(898)     ku$w<a@     E$nE@    ya&˘ yE$rE@ sç@ƒç^˘-Ø                wa$,

15.1.14 VP-chaining with me$y<A VP with its verb in infinitival (bare-stem) form followed by particle me$y<
may be chained with a following VP (perhaps with inflected verb). Some fairly
long chains with multiple [VP me$y<] constituents occur in texts.
    The particle has variants ma$y< and mE$, and an archaic variant mE@r<E@ was
recorded from an old man (226.e). I generally transcribe me$y< unless the
variant pronunciation is very clear on the tape.
    The particle is sometimes heard with high pitch. When this pronunciation
occurs clause-finally, I attribute the high pitch to nonterminal high intonation
contour  rather than to a phonological H-tone, and accordingly transcribe
me$y<.
                                                                15.1 Chaining    533     There are, however, a few cases where a high-pitched me@y< seems to occur
before a clitic or a clause-final particle, and does not have a convincing
intonational explanation. Here it is necessary to mark the tone as high. See line
1 of (1079) and line 1 of (903).
     For lack of a better gloss, I use ‘and’ in interlinears, but me$y< is not used to
conjoin NPs or other constituents.
     The chained VPs (almost) always have a shared subject. The temporal
relation between the relevant eventualities is variable (anteriority or simul-
taneity). If the VP ending in me$y< denotes a short-duration event, the normal
interpretation is that this event was completed before that denoted by the
following VP. This is the case in (899).(899)   a. [a$na@    ku$<]    n)E&-n       go@˘         me$y<,

           [sa^˘-Ø §15.1.15] 2004.3.17    In (900), the temporal relationship involves at least some overlap. In
(900.a), ‘carry (on head)’ and ‘bring’ overlap, though ‘carry’ focuses on the
onset (when the load is put up on the head), while ‘bring’ focuses on the end-
point. In (900.b), the temporal overlap is complete.(900)   a. … [be@       ne$]      de$˘-ba$,

Rarely, the verb has a nonzero AN suffix. (564.b) has a verb with Recent
Perfect -jE$ followed by me$y<. In (902), two occurrences of Imperfective -tç@ƒç$
occur in a chain ending in me$y<. I have one textual example, however, where
me$y< follows a verb with an AN suffix, namely Imperfective -tç@ƒç$-. The
passage in question comes at a narrative climax, and the VP containing -tç@ƒç$- is
itself repeated.(902)     lE@˘    wo$        ga@˘    ka^n,

        holding on to it (for dear life), and then …’      Though me$y< occurs in final position in a clause (or VP) in the great
majority of textual instances, in (903) it is followed by y$ la$˘ de$y ‘if it is not’
(i.e., ‘unless’ or ‘other than). The final ‘there was none of that’ negates the other
parts of the me$y< chain, but the double negation constituted by the embedded
‘if it is not’ insures that ‘staying on top of the mountain’ is not negated. In
combination with y$, the particle occured in H-toned form me@y<.(903)   [[tu$mo@ ma@na$] be@˘         me@y<]y$< la$˘         de$y,

        (ti@la^y) 2004.3.20     Although nearly all cases of me$y< involve same-subject clause sequences,
occasionally this is not so. It is not clear whether the textual counterexamples
are grammatically significant, however. Since the me$y< clause precedes the
main clause (or the next clause in a more complex chain), there is always the
possibility that the speaker may have incorrectly anticipated the subject of the
following clause. An example is (905), where a string of clauses with the same
human subject, all ending in me$y<, is concluded by a clause with a nonhuman
subject (‘disputes’). The same-subject construction could have been saved if the
speaker had used causative ‘he will bring (the dispute) to an end’, instead of
536     Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clauses
intransitive ‘it (=dispute) will come to an end’. A similar example occurs in

11.2.2.4 Existential quasi-verbs (kç$, sometimes wç$-) with yç@The form kç$, which as a locational predicator requires nonhuman reference, is
often extended to human categories in the ‘there is/are’ construction (exis-

are readily used for present as well as past time reference.
     However, a single instance of a suffixally marked imperfective wç@˘-tç@ƒç$-
turned up in a text (685.a), and a parallel form with nonhuman kç@˘-tç@ƒç$- was
elicited (685.b).(685)     a. [Agadès   bE@rE$] wç@˘-tç@ƒç$      me$y<
             [A        in]     be.Hum-Impf      and
             ‘while (we were) staying in Agadès (city in northern Niger)’
             2004.5.5          b. [Agadès     bE@rE$]   kç@˘-tç@ƒç$          me$y<

             ‘while (it was) staying in Agadès’
11.2.3 ‘Be in’ (ku$n-), ‘be on’ (na$˘-)ku$n-, which is limited to the unsuffixed Perfective and to its negation, is
irregularly related to the (mostly) regular transitive verb ku@no@- ‘put’. The latter
optionally reduces to H-toned ku@n- by Post-Sonorant Syncope in combinations
with coronal-initial suffix, hence Perfective ku@no@-ti $- varying with ku@n-ti -$ . The
transitive stem undergoes regular tone-dropping before negative AN suffixes,
one of which has coronal-initial suffix, hence Perfective Negative ku$no$-li@-
varying with ku$n-li@-. There is also another verb, ku@r<o@- ‘wear (garment)’ that
syncopates to ku@n-, and its syncopated forms are homophonous to those of
ku@no@-. In spite of the surface ku$n- in transitive ku$n-li@-, intransitive ku$n- ‘be
in’ is always easily identified, since it takes no AN suffixes except in a (stative)
Negative form ku$n-o@- with LH tone contour.
     In relatives, the participles of intransitive ku$n- are Nonhuman ku^n-Ø (819),
human Sg ku@n-i n  $ (467.c) and human Pl ku@n-u$m (688).
     Existential yE@ regularly precedes intransitive ku$n- in positive main clauses
in the absence of another focalized constituent. When the two are adjacent, the
                                          11.2 ‘Be’, ‘become’, and other statives    421pronunciation is yç@ku$n-. Based on the vocalic assimilation (rounding), I treat
this combination as cliticized, cf. yç@kç$ and yç@wç$- with ‘be’ quasi-verbs.
     ku$n- is usually translatable as ‘be in X’, ‘be put in X’, or ‘be included in X,
be a part of X’. It requires a locational complement in the X role. The usual
locational is a PP with bE@rE$ or bE$rE^˘ ‘in, inside’ (686.a-c), or sometimes with
the all-purpose postposition le$ in locative function (686.d). In free translation, it
is sometimes more idiomatic to rephrase ‘X be in Y’ as ‘Y have X in it’ or the
like (686.d).(686)    a. E$n)E@    [E$n)E-$ u$gu@     bE@rE$] yç@ku$n-Ø

lexicalized. It denotes the mid-sized knife regularly worn by men on a sheath
tied to their belt cord at the hip.
     The irregular negation of ku$n- is ku$n-o@-. The LH tone contour of this form
distinguishes it from (positive) ku@no@- ‘put’ and its unsuffixed Perfective
variants ku$no$- and (in perfective relatives) ku@no$-. As usual, Existential yE@ is
absent from negative clauses.

10.2.4 Tones of subject pronominal suffixesExcluding Nonhuman kç$ in the unsuffixed Imperfective, the nonzero pro-
nominal suffixes have no intrinsic tones. Instead, they acquire a tone from a
preceding morpheme (including the floating L-tone that characterizes the
unsuffixed Imperfective). Surface patterns are given in (591), using 1Sg -m to
represent the single-C suffixes, and 2Pl -be to represent the syllabic suffixes.

                                     (occasionally …v$-m@, …v$-be@)      Pattern (591.a) occurs when the pronominal-subject suffix is added to
Perfective Negative -li@- or to Imperfective Negative -go@-. Thus bE$rE$-go@-Ø
‘he/she cannot’, 1Sg bE$rE$-go@-m, 2Pl bE$rE$-go@-be@. See Atonal-Morpheme Tone-
Spreading (137).
      (591.b) is the pattern for the unsuffixed Imperfective. Examples: bE$rE@-
‘get’, unsuffixed Imperfective /bE$rE@- + L/, hence 1Sg bE$rE@-m$, 2Pl bE$rE@-be$. The
floating L-tone is grafted onto (i.e. docks on) the suffixal mora; see Tone-
Grafting (131).
      In (591.c), the Perfective suffix allomorph -a^˘- has its own intrinsic F-tone
(i.e. <HL>). The final L-tone component spreads to a syllabic suffix, as in 2Pl
-a^˘-be$, again by Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137). When -a^˘- is part of a
trimoraic syllable including a suffixal nasal, as in the 1Sg form, the F-tone is
spread out over the whole syllable; see Contour-Tone Stretching (143).
Examples: 1Sg do$g-a^˘-m ‘I am finished (=have gotten thin)’, 2Pl do$g-a^˘-ba$.
      (591.d) is the pattern for the (all-L-toned) unsuffixed Perfective, and for all
remaining nonzero positive AN suffixes, all of which end in a L-tone
(Perfective -ti $- or -yE$-/-ya$-, Resultative -sa$-, Recent Perfect -jE$-, Experiential
Perfect -tE@rE$-, Habitual -a@˘ra$-, marked Imperfective -tç@ƒç$-). Examples:
Perfective la@ƒa@-ti -$ Ø ‘he/she hit’, la@ƒa@-ti -$ m ‘I hit’, and la@ƒa@-ti -$ be$ ‘you-Pl hit’;
unsuffixed Perfective la$ƒa$-Ø ‘he/she hit’, la$ƒa$-m ‘I hit’, and la$ƒa$-be$ ‘you-Pl
hit’.
      In the unsuffixed Perfective, an ostensibly L-toned pronominal-subject
suffix occasionally appears with unexpected H-tone, although the preceding
stem is entirely L-toned: la$ƒa$-m@ ‘I hit’, la$ƒa$-ba@ ‘they hit’ (for the more usual
la$ƒa$-m, la$ƒa$-ba$). This is most common when the word is pronounced in
isolation, and reflects a constraint (not generally implemented in phrasal
contexts) against all-L-toned words. Cf. discussioin of related issues in §3.7.1.5.

usual clause-final position it has L-tone. An R-toned variant is possible when it
is followed by another element within the clause (see below).
     The particle is especially useful after predicates that lack aspectual
marking: adjectives and other statives, unconjugated (or conjugated) ‘it is’
clitic y$ ‘it is’, and ‘be’ and ‘have’ quasi-verbs. It is also common after regular
imperfective verbs, placing the eventuality in the past (‘used to do’, ‘was

as background to another eventuality.(593)    a. nu$m-a^˘-Ø         j i $˘<

             ‘(a place) where they (had) hid you-Sg’     There is another construction with what appears to be the same morpheme,
this time in the form j i& ˘$<-. The preceding verb takes its regular lexical tone and
is uninflectable, showing that a verb-chain is at hand. j i& ˘$<- itself is morpho-
logically an unsuffixed Imperfective, implying an R-toned lexical form /j i&˘</
onto which the extra L-tone of the unsuffixed Perfective is grafted to produce a
bell-shaped <LHL> tone when the following pronominal or Participial suffix is
zero. When the suffix is nonzero, the floating L-tone appears on the suffixal
mora, by regular phonological rules; see Tone-Grafting (131), Contour-Tone
Stretching (143), Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137). That ji&˘$<- is an
unsuffixed Imperfective is demonstrated by the fact that a Nonhuman subject
requires a following cliticized ‘be’ quasi-verb kç$, a unique feature of this AN
category. Other subject categories have their usual suffixal forms. The sense of
this construction is ‘(does/will do) in the meantime’ (i.e. while waiting for an
expected subsequent event)’. The time reference is to the present or future

10.4 Imperatives and Hortatives10.4.1 Imperatives and ProhibitivesThe forms of the Imperative (Imprt) depend on polarity and on addressee
number. The positive Imperatives are based on the Imperative (Imprt) stem. For
nearly all monosyllabic (C)v˘- and short-voweled (C)vCv- bisyllabic stems, the
Imperative is an all-H-toned stem (C)v@˘- or (C)v@Cv@-, the shift being audible in
the case of R-toned (C)v&˘- and LH-toned (C)v$Cv@- stems (see below for a few
exceptions where the shift to all-H does not occur). Other stems, including
bisyllabic long-voweled (C)v˘Cv- stems, and all stems of three or more syl-
lables, use their lexical form as the Imperative.
    The Imperative stem always ends in an H-tone. The subject suffix is zero
for singular, L-toned -y$ for plural addressee. The negative imperative (i.e.,
Prohibitive) is characterized by a suffix -y@ added to an L-toned form of the
verb stem; la^y is added if the addressee is plural.(599)     addressee         positive imperative negative (prohibitive)          Sg                Imprt stem          L-toned stem plus-y@
          Pl                Imprt stem plus -y$ L-toned stem plus -y@ la^y     There is some potential for homophony between the singular Prohibitive in
-y@ and the 1Pl unsuffixed Perfective in -y. Both follow all-L-toned stems. The
1Pl suffix is usually L-toned after an unsuffixed Perfective, in which case there
is no homophony. However, in an all-L-toned word, a nonzero pronominal-
subject suffix is sometimes realized with a H-tone, especially in isolation or
before a clause-final particle. For example, go$˘-y@ ‘don’t go out!’ is audibly
distinct from go$˘-y ‘we went out’ in the usual case where the latter is clause-

above, ‘we went out’ may also be heard as go$˘-y@.
     For monosyllabic (C)v˘- stems, homophony between the singular
Prohibitive in -y@ and the Verbal Noun (allomorph -y@ after monosyllabic stem)
also threatens. However, it is avoided in that the stem vowel is shortened in the
Verbal Noun but not in the plural Imperative: go$˘-y@ ‘don’t go out!’, but go$-y@
‘going out (VblN)’.
     The Imperative and Prohibitive forms for ‘come’ are given in (600). Note
the H-tone Imperative stem yE@rE@-, compare the LH tone of the lexical stem
yE$rE@-. Note also how the tones distinguish yE$rE$-y@ (600.b) from yE@rE@-y$ (600.c).(600)   a. yE@rE@

imperative), da$na$Na$-y@< (singular Prohibitive), da$na$Na@-y$< (plural Imperative),
da$na$Na$-y@< la^y (plural Prohibitive). Note that the (positive) imperatives retain
the lexical LLH tone, since the shift from LH (or R) basic form to all-H
imperative stem is confined to monosyllabic and short-voweled bisyllabic
stems.
     The textual examples below are singular Imperative (601.a), plural Imper-
ative (601.b-c), singular Prohibitive (601.d-e), and plural Prohibitive (601.f).

preceding verb yE$rE@ has its lexical tones as an ordinary chained verb. Likewise

10.4.2 Irregular {LH} imperative stemsAs noted before, most monosyllabic Cv˘-, and short-voweled bisyllabic
(C)vCv- stems require all-H tone in the Imperative stem. Regular examples:
monosyllabic ja&˘<- ‘dig’, Imperative ja@˘< ; bisyllabic di g      $ E@- ‘follow’, Imperative
di@gE@ (note the tone shifts).
     A few R-toned monosyllabic or LH-toned short-voweled bisyllabic stems
irregularly preserve their lexical tones in the Imperative stem. Those known to
me are ya&˘- ‘go’, di N$ e@- ‘sit down’, i n
                                           $ e) @ ‘lie down, go to bed’, and ya$Na@- ‘look;
pick up’. The Imperatives are ya&˘ ‘go!’, di N       $ e@ ‘sit down!’, i$n)e@ ‘go to bed!’, and
ya$Na@ ‘look!’
     For wç&˘- ‘kill’, I recorded a special positive Imperative form wç&˘ ti@-, hence
singular Imperative wç&˘ ti@ ‘kill!’ with plural /wç&˘ ti@-y$/ (= wç&˘ ti^˘-Ø). Here wç&˘
appears to be the bare stem, followed (in a verb-chain construction) by ti@- as the
inflectable stem. This ti@ may be related to the Linker ti@ that occurs in some
verb-chains with chronological-sequencing sense (§15.1.16), but the precise
relationship is unclear. The corresponding Prohibitives of ‘kill’ are regular and
omit ti@-, hence singular wç$˘-y@ ‘don’t-Sg kill!’, plural wç$˘-y@ la^y ‘don’t-Pl kill!’.

Imperative of cE@˘<- ‘slaughter, cut the throat of’, which of course has a lexical
sense very similar to ‘kill’.","[395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403]"

11.5.2 ‘Have possession of’ verbs (ji $ne@-, je$re@-)The verb ji $ne@- is a regular verb with the full spectrum of AN stems in the sense
‘hold’ or ‘keep’. It may also be used as a verb of custodial possession, ‘have
possession of’, in which case it approaches sa$- in function but puts more
emphasis on (perhaps temporary) physical possession or control. Three
syntactic features characterize the possessive use of ji $ne@-.
                                                    11.5 Possessive predicates    437    The first is that, in the sense ‘have’, the only stem used in positive clauses is
L-toned unsuffixed Perfective ji $ne$-, even with present time reference.
    The second is that ji $ne$- (like sa$-) is preceded by Existential yE@ (§11.2.2.1)
in positive possessive predications, if there is no (other) explicitly focalized
constituent. A chained verb may intervene between yE@ and ji $ne@- (716.a). yE@ is
not used before ji $ne@- with lexical tones in the sense ‘hold’.(716)   a. [ma$lfa^˘<     yE@     da$ra@ ji $ne$-Ø]

           many       cow    exist have.Perf.L-3PlS
           ‘They have many cattle.’ 2004.3.10    Thirdly, in possessive function (‘have’) ji $ne$- is negated by adding -la@-, as
in (717). This suffix is a stative Negative also used e.g. with adjectival
predicates (§11.4.3). By contrast, as a regular verb in the sense ‘hold’, ji $ne@- has
ordinary Perfective Negative and Imperfective Negative suffixes.(717)   a. [i n$ e$  ga$ma$-na@m yE@         sa$-ba$],

           have-Neg-1SgS
           ‘I don’t have any.’      The verb je$re@- ‘keep, have for oneself’ is more or less interchangeable with,
ji $ne@-, and it has the same morphosyntax. Therefore, in the sense ‘have’, it
regularly appears in the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective form je$re$-, is preceded
by Existential yE@ in positive clauses in the absence of a focalized constituent,
and is negated by -la@- (hence je$l-la@-) with no yE@ (718).

11.5.3 ‘Belong to’ predicates (ce@y$)The usual predication of belonging, with the property as subject, is of the form
[X ce@y$] ‘it belongs to X’ or ‘it is X’s’. The object possessed may be expressed
as a separate NP preceding the core [X ce@y$] unit; this NP is best taken as a
presentential topic and is often set off by an intonation break. ce@ is presumably
historically related to cE&˘ (variant ci $gE@) ‘thing’. I gloss it as ‘possession’ in
interlinears. It is syntactically an inalienably possessed noun (hence e.g. 1Sg mi $
ce@y$ ‘it is mine’, E$mE$ ce@y$ ‘it is ours’, etc., with L-toned inalienable possessor
pronominals). The y$ is the common ‘it is’ clitic. The negation is with la$˘
(719.b), as usual for the ‘it is’ clitic (§7.2.1.3).(719)     a. [na$Na@     fu@˘]   [pu@lç$-m        ce@y$]

           2004.3.10   An alternative ‘belong to’ construction is to add y$ ‘it is’ to a possessed
noun.(720)   [ko$     na$Na@      ku$<],

11.6 Verb iterationBecause chains of the type [… verb1] [… verb2-inflection], and expanded chains
like [… verb1] [… verb2] [… verb3-inflection], are normal in Jamsay discourse
(§15.1), two adjacent occurrences of the same verb could be taken as a special
case of chaining, absent any special phonological or morphosyntactic
distinguishing factors. This is logical enough, since verb iteration typically
denotes structurally patterned and temporally closely spaced repetitions of an
event type (“fall-fall” = ‘keeps falling down’), a semantic relationship shared
with some non-cognate verb chains. However, repetition of a single event type
lends itself to a kind of emphasis that is lacking with noniterative verb chains.","[458, 459, 460, 461]"

both antecedent and consequent clauses. Occasionally ji ˘$ < is omitted in the
antecedent (990.d). The antecedent ends in the usual ‘if’ particle dey, which
follows ji ˘$ <. A verb in a positive antecedent typically has Resultative -sa$-

in its usual L-toned unsuffixed Perfective form (990.c-d). A regular verb in the

17 Complement and purposive clauses
17.1 Quotative complement17.1.1 Direct versus indirect in quotative complementsJamsay quotative complements have a mix of “direct” and “indirect” discourse
features. A distinction between direct and indirect discourse can be made on the
basis of deictics, particularly first and second person pronouns. In completely
direct discourse, the original deictics (including pronominals) are preserved. In
indirect discourse there is a new deictic center (usually including a new
speaker and listener), so pronouns and other deictics must be shifted. The
regular conversions are those in (992).(992)                                      direct     indirect        a.   original speaker            1Sg mi@      Logophoric Sg E$nE@
             original speaker and others 1Pl E@mE@    Logophoric Pl E$nE@ be@        b.   original addressee            2Sg u@     3Sg wo@
             original addressees           2Pl e@     3Pl be@     For more on logophorics, see §18.2. Note that in addition to logophorics
(referring to the quoted speaker), third person pronominals are regularly used
to refer to the original addressee(s). The conversions in (992) assume that the
original speaker and the original addressee(s) are distinct from the current
speaker and addressee. Thus the original threatening speech event (993.a) could
be reported, by a third party to a fourth party, as (993.b).(993)   a. u@            wç&˘-m$
           2SgO          kill.Impf-1SgS
           ‘I will kill you-Sg.’        b. [E$nE@   wo@        wç&˘ $ -Ø]         wa$
           [LogoS 3SgO kill.Impf-3SgS] say
           ‘Hex said (to hery) that hex would kill hery.’
588     Complement and purposive clauses
     The 3rd person substituting for original 2nd person is not treated as a full-
fledged 3rd person pronominal. In particular, it does not serve as an antecedent
for a reflexive, as does a true 3rd person; see §18.4.6.
     However, it sometimes happens that an original-speech-event speaker
and/or addressee is also a participant in the current speech act. In this case,
the current speech-act participant status trumps the indirect conversions in
(992), as in English, where a directly quoted I will kill you, with speech-act
roles reversed in the current speech event, becomes indirectly quoted (you said
that) you would kill me.
     An example of this trumping is (994), from a text describing how disputes
are resolved. The speaker uses ‘you-Pl’ generically to denote the disputants. In
the (indirect) quotation, the disputants are also the original addressees (i.e., are
embedded second persons). The original 1Sg shifts to Logophoric as usual.
However, the expected shift of embedded 2Pl to 3Pl pronoun be@ does not occur,
since their status as current speech-event addressees locks the referents into
second person status.","[607, 608, 609, 610]"

11 VP and predicate structure
11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure11.1.1 Verb types (forms)Inflectable verb stems (including derivational but not AN suffixes) are
predominantly of the following shapes (the initial C is optional): Cv˘-, CvCv-,
Cv˘Cv-, and CvCvCv- (rarely CvCvCvCv-). There are a modest number of
CvCCv- stems of native Dogon origin, generally reflecting syncope from
*CvCvCv-, and there are quite a few verbs borrowed from Fulfulde with shapes
like CvCCv-. For patterns of vocalic harmony applicable to verbs, see §3.4.5.
     I use the term quasi-verbs to denote any of a small set of predicative
elements, with specialized grammatical functions, that have the extra-short
shape Cv- or in one case CvC-. Several of these (jE$-, sa$-, wç$-, kç$-, ku$n-) are
limited to the unsuffixed Perfective in positive clauses. That is, they are
followed (in positive utterances) only by pronominal-subject suffixes. Except
for jE$-, which is positive only, the quasi-verbs also have irregular, aspectually
undifferentiated negative forms.
     jE$- ‘say’ and sa$- ‘have’ can arguably be identified morphemically with
aspectual suffixes (Recent Perfect -jE$-, Resultative -sa$-). This raises the
possibility that they are AN suffixes in the special case where the preceding
verb-stem slot is phonologically empty.
     On the other hand, wç$- and kç$- ‘exist’, which are differentiated as human
and nonhuman, have a striking resemblance to third person pronominal wo@
(human singular) and ko@ (nonhuman), respectively. In addition, a clitic kç$$ is
used for Nonhuman subject in the unsuffixed Imperfective. This suggests that
quasi-verbs wç$- and kç$- ‘exist’ might be pronominals, or more specifically
(imperfective) pronominal-agreement morphemes, again following a
phonologically empty verb-stem slot. ku$n- ‘be in’, with its unique CvC- shape,
functions (in part) as an irregular, and semantically specialized, passive of the
common verb ku@no@- ‘put’.
     The morpheme-class status of all of these elements is at best ambiguous,
but the issues are different in each case, hence my term of convenience “quasi-
verb.” I have previously used the term in connection with similar issues in
Songhay languages. Quotative wa, however, cannot directly take any verbal
inflectional material and is unambiguously a particle.

uninflected (for pronominal subject), and with a set of inflected forms (§11.2.1).
     Aside from quasi-verbs, the quotative particle, the copula clitic, and a few
aspectually defective verbs of possession and stance, there are few irregularities
in verbal morphology. A handful of verbs have minor phonological irregu-
larities in certain suffixed AN forms (617).","[407, 408, 409]"
"
11.2.2 Existential and locative quasi-verbs and particles11.2.2.1 Existential particle (yE@)This is not an inflectable verb, rather a particle (or arguably an obligatorily
chained quasi-verb) that precedes a few (quasi-)verbs expressing existence/
location or possession.
     The Existential particle is obligatory in positive, unfocalized main clauses
predicating existence or possession. It is not used in negative counterparts of
these clauses, and it is not used when a nonpredicative constituent is focalized.
The relevant positive combinations are the possessives yE@ sa$- ‘have’ (§11.5.1),
yE@ ji n
       $ e$- ‘have possession of’ (§11.5.2), yç@ku$n- ‘be in’ (§11.2.3), and the
existentials yç@wç$- ‘be (human)’ and yç@kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ (§11.2.2.4). Note
that the vowel shifts to ç (by idiosyncratic assimilation) when the following
stem has a back rounded vowel. Examples are given in the sections referred to.
                                        11.2 ‘Be’, ‘become’, and other statives   411In the case of ji n
                  $ e@-, yE@ is used in the possessive reading, but not in the non-
possessive sence ‘hold’.
    I interpret Existential yE@ as indicating that the existential-locational or
possessive quasi-verb is not defocused. yE@ is absent when there is a true
focalized constituent. Therefore yE@ is absent in (663), where an interrogative
element functions as focalized constituent.(663)   a. a&˘y$     i $ju@      ji n
                                     $ e$

           [what?    for]    dog     hold.Perf.L-2SgS
           ‘Why do you-Sg have a dog?’     When yE@ is present, ji $ne@- in the sense ‘have possession of’ appears in
L-toned unsuffixed Perfective form. The other possessive and existential-
locational quasi-verbs likewise occur in main clauses only in an L-toned form
(sa$-, wç$-, kç$-) interpretable as unsuffixed Perfective. The unsuffixed Perfective
for other verbs is associated with the presence of a focalized constituent. This
suggests that yE@ itself functions as a default focalized constituent, in the
absence of a “real” focus.
     yE@ is absent in relatives. This may reflect the general defocalization of
elements within relatives. Compare the relative clause (‘those who have …’)
where ‘have’ is without yE@ in (664) with the immediately following clause (‘if
you-Sg have …’) where the same ‘have’ quasi-verb is preceded by yE@.(664)   in

        ‘Now (as for) those who have a manual trade [topic], if you-Sg have a
        manual trade, …’ 2004.5.3     Existential yE@ may have originated as a demonstrative element, cf.
demonstrative adverb yE@-di ˘$ < ‘over there’ (§212.c). If so, it joins English there
(as in there is/are …) and a long line of other demonstrative adverbs that have
evolved into existentials. There is another preverbal particle yE@ that seems to
have reference-indexing (and mild presentative) function, used with any verb
(§4.3.3). This particle may also have evolved from the same demonstrative
element. Perfective suffix -yE$-/-ya$- on inflected verbs (§10.1.2.3) is probably
unrelated.
412     VP and predicate structure
     yE@ is usually immediately adjacent to the verb, but if a direct object clitic
intervenes between the two, as in yE@ ko@ je$re$-ba$ ‘they (have) kept it’ (674.a).","[432, 433, 434]"
"
13.2.3 ‘Whatchamacallit?’cE&˘ or ci $gE@ ‘thing’ is used as a ‘whatchamacallit?’ filler noun with nonhuman
reference, or as an adverbial. It is not a true interrogative morphosyntactically,
but it does have some similarity to self-directed questions, cf. French comment
dirais-je?(794)   [ga@˘w E$mE$    ya^˘-Ø]                cE&˘   na$˘-y<,

        day).’ (French bac) 2004.5.1    In local French, chose is used in this way, and it has spawned verbs choser
and chosiner ‘do whatchamacallit?’.
    An overtly self-directed question ‘how do they say it?’ (yç&˘-ji $n ga@-ba$) may
also be used as a ‘whatchamacallit?’ phrase.
    There is no simple inflectable verb with the sense ‘do/be whatchamacallit?’.
The phrase ci $gE@ ka@r<a@-, literally ‘do (a) thing’ is used.
476     Focalization and interrogation
13.2.4 Embedded interrogativesIn this section I consider interrogative complements to main-clause verbs like
‘know’, as in ‘I don’t know (whether/who/what …)’.
    An embedded polar interrogative clause (‘whether or not …’) is a simple
quotative complement (§17.1), plus the usual clause-final interrogative particle
ma. The particle distinguishes an embedded interrogative (‘I didn’t know
whether …’) from a factive complement (‘I didn’t know that …’), although the
Jamsay embedded interrogative construction may be used (as complement of
‘know’) where English would use the factive complement. Examples are in
(795).(795)     a. [u@   yE$rE^˘     ma$]    jE@     u@ju@ro@-sa$-ba$

where English speakers would use a factive complement. This is the case in
(796.a), above, which would more naturally be expressed as ‘… who knows that
it was I …’ in a free English translation.
    Embedded WH interrogatives may be of two types. In one, the regular
WH-word is used, with optional clause-final interrogative particle ma. This
type approximates direct discourse, except for deictic substitutions such as
logophoric pronominals, where appropriate (797).(797)   a. jE$yE@-tu$-ba$      ta@Na$˘     de$y,

           ‘I don’t know how much they paid.’     This type, with the regular WH-word, is preferred for embedded ‘how
much?’ and for embedded ‘who?’. In the first case, this may be for lack of a
suitable nominal counterpart (‘amount’, ‘quantity’). In the second, the
preference may be due to avoidance of ambiguity between e.g. ‘I don’t know
who lives here’ (identificational knowledge) versus ‘I don’t know the person
who lives here’ (acquaintance).
     The second possibility for embedded WH interrogatives is the literal type
exemplified by “I don’t know the place in which he is” as the translation of
English ‘I don’t know where he is.’ That is, a generic noun like ‘place’, ‘time’,
‘manner’, or ‘thing’ is the head of a relative clause, which (as a syntactic NP)
functions as direct object of ‘know’ or other main-clause verb. There is no overt
interrogative element.

14 Relativization
14.1 Basics of relative clausesThe basic relative clause pattern has an internal head NP (marked by tone-
dropping), and a participle agreeing in gender-number features with this head
NP (rather than an inflected verb agreeing in all pronominal features with the
clause subject). Modifying adjectives and cardinal numerals remain with the
internal head NP, but some other NP-final elements (e.g. Definite ku$<, Plural
be@, universal and distributive quantifiers) follow the participle. The participle
itself therefore behaves somewhat like an adjective modifying the head noun in
several respects (recall that modifying adjectives also force tone-dropping on
the modified noun, and precede the NP-final elements mentioned above).
     It is also possible to expand this core relative clause structure (ending with a
participle and perhaps one or two NP-final morphemes) by adding a copy of the
head noun (not the full head NP), as a special kind of external head.
Specifically, this copied noun is “possessed” by the relative-clause proper,
which functions here as the possessor NP (and is therefore followed by
Possessive ma$). The complete construction may be suggested (crudely) by a
structural paraphrase, whereby ‘a/the dog that I saw’ is expanded as as ‘dog of
[a/the big dog that I saw]’, though of course the linear order in Jamsay is very
different (with the external ‘dog’ at the end). The copied external head noun is
optional, and occurs in fewer than half of relative clauses occurring in my texts,
but it is nonetheless quite well-attested.
     The internal head NP is occasionally omitted, whether or not the external
head is present. This results in an internally headless relative. However, in
such cases it is reasonable to think of a “light” head noun (such as ‘person’,
‘thing’, ‘place’, ‘time’, or ‘manner’) as being virtually present, though
phonologically inaudible. Furthermore, the participle agrees with this virtual
head: (human) Singular, (human) Plural, or Nonhuman. We can therefore think
of the agreement morpheme on the participle as a stand-in for a full head NP,
just as subject-pronominal suffixation on the verb of a main clause can function
as “subject NP.”
     Thus the maximal relative-clause construction might be described as
double-headed. However, the Jamsay construction (when examined in detail) is
rather unique, and I question how useful it would be to assign it to a general
“double-headed” typological category.
480     Relativization
     Within the relative-clause proper, the head NP remains in situ, i.e. it is not
systematically extracted to either the left or the right of (the rest of) the clause.
The head noun often happens to be clause-initial (disregarding topicalized
constituents), as is true of nonpronominal NPs in general, but it need not be so.
     Relative clauses in Jamsay are not used for parenthetical comments, as in
English nonrestrictive relatives of the type I like John, who (by the way) is in
Texas right now.
     Jamsay relatives may be definite or indefinite. If definite (‘the man whom I
saw’), they presuppose that the propositional content of the clause is true, and
known to the listener, often by virtue of preceding discourse. Since the content
is presupposed, there is a high propability that core NPs other than the
relativized NP itself will appear in pronominal form. Since pronominals (if not
topicalized or emphatic) occur in immediately preverbal position, this typically
results in clause-initial position for the (internal) head NP. Indefinite relatives
(‘a/any man who can climb this hill’) characterize an unidentified or generic
referent by the relevant proposition, which may include new nonpronominal
discourse referents, so in such relatives the head NP have no unusual
association with clause-initial position.
     Some notable features of Jamsay relatives, in addition to the use of
participles and the arrangement of (internal and external) heads as outlined
above, are the use of preverbal L-toned subject pronominals in non-subject
relatives with no nonpronominal subject NP, and the application of a H(H…)L
tone overlay to unsuffixed Perfective verbs (which generally replace suffixed
positive Perfective verb forms).
     Some important spatiotemporal and manner clauses are simply relative
clauses with a noun like ‘day’ or ‘place, manner’ as (overt or covert) head.","[497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502]"

2.1   ProsodyPrevious published and unpublished descriptions of Dogon languages have
regularly commented that some form of lexical tone or accent is present, and
that it is subject to grammatical modification. However, no previous study has
actually analysed the prosodic system of a Dogon language.
     In Jamsay, tone (lexical and grammatical) and intonation (including
grammaticalized intonation patterns) play a central role. Indeed, I know of no
(non-Dogon) language where prosody is so tightly integrated with the
morphosyntax. Working on Jamsay has deepened my conviction that currently
dominant grammatical theories, with their sharp compartmentalization of
“phonology” and “syntax,” are badly misguided.
     The prosodic ingredients are given in (1). H[igh] and L[ow] are the
primitives of the tonal system. F[alling] and R[ising] are abbreviations for two-
part contour tones <HL> and <LH>, respectively.(1)     a. lexical tones for stems
               combinations of H[igh] and L[ow] tonal primitives;
               no mora can have more than one tone;

                      —end of word preceding universal quantifier fu@˘ ‘all’       The contribution of tonal and intonational elements to Jamsay grammar is
therefore vast. Jamsay does with prosody much of what other languages do with
grammatical morphemes, or with morphosyntactic restructurings including
linear movement. Three examples: 1) most pronouns (excluding suffixes on
verbs) show no variation in segmental form across independent, subject, object,
and possessor categories, but use tones to make some distinctions (e.g. 3Pl be@
for independent, object, and alienable possessor, but be$ for subject and
inalienable possessor). 2) NP’s X and Y are normally conjoined in Jamsay
simply as [X Y], with no conjunction morpheme but with dying-quail final
intonation on both conjuncts. 3) the difference between main and relative
clauses is largely (though not entirely) expressed by tonal modifications. In
relatives, the (internal) head is not fronted. Instead, the final word of the head
NP drops its tones, a pronominal subject is expressed (in non-subject relatives)
by a preverbal L-toned pronominal, and Perfective verbs have the H(H…)L tone
overlay. There are also Participial suffixes, but since the form for Nonhuman
head is -Ø (zero), as is the 3Sg subject form in main clauses, the Participial
suffix cannot be relied on as an audible indicator of relative-clause status.
       At the lexical level, tone is also important. Most native Jamsay words are
built up with Cv and Cv˘ syllables, with a smattering of CvC and a few Cv˘C
and extra-long Cv˘˘ syllables. Cv is monomoraic (=has one mora or syllabic
weight unit), Cv˘ and CvC are bimoraic, and Cv˘C and Cv˘˘ are trimoraic. Each
mora can have its own tonal primitive, H[igh] or L[ow], so a monomoraic
syllable can be only H or L, a bimoraic syllable can be H, L, F (= <HL>), or R
(= <LH>), and a trimoraic syllable can be any of the above or bell-shaped
<LHL>. There are some minimal pairs such as di@gE@ ‘bird’s leg’ versus d i $gE@
‘row’, ç$˘r<ç@ ‘monkey’ versus ç&˘r<ç$ ‘waterskin’, and ci@rE@ ‘horn’ versus ci$rE@
‘hard wood’. Many word families include a noun and a related verb that differ
in tone. For example, the HH-toned noun bi@rE@ ‘work’ is associated with the
LH-toned verb bi r$ E@- ‘work’, and the two regularly combine in the VP bi@rE@
bi r$ E@- ‘work, do some work’.
10    Sketch
     While lexical and grammatical tones have a competitive relationship (stem-
wide tonal overlays completely erase lexical tones), there is an important sense
in which lexical and grammatical tones work together. The requirement that all
stems have at least one H makes it possible to use stem-wide tone-dropping (to
all-L) as a reliable indicator of morphosyntactic function (e.g. head of relative).
The other common stem-wide tone overlay, H(H…)L, is always audible with
verbs, whose lexical forms are tonally all-H or {LH}, and usually audible with
nouns and other stems, since only a minority of these have lexical {HL}
contours.
     The all-H tone overlay is less reliably audible in Jamsay, which has many
lexically all-H verb and noun stems. For example, there is an all-H overlay for
imperative verbs of some shapes; it is audible for lexical {LH} but not for
lexical all-H stems. However, among the various types of participle-final
agentive compounds, the type with all-H final does clearly contrast with the
others, which are based either on the unsuffixed Perfective with H(H…)L
overlaid tone or on the unsuffixed Imperfective with final-syllable F-tone.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"

"
10.2.2 Nonhuman versus 3Sg subjectCliticized quasi-verb kç$ ‘be.Nonh’ is added to the unsuffixed Imperfective to
index a Nonhuman subject. The L-tone segment that marks Imperfective,
underlyingly located between the stem proper and the kç$, is realized on the
kç$ (i.e. it merges with the already low tone of the clitic). Thus mi@ cE@rE@kç$ ‘it
will bite me’ from /cE@rE@-Lkç$/, see Tone-Grafting (131).
     kç$ is syntactically and morphologically verblike rather than a typical
pronominal suffix. Whereas the human subject pronominal suffixes are replaced
by preverbal subject pronominals in relative clauses, kç$ remains in postverbal
position in relatives, and Participial suffixes are added to it rather than to the
preceding verb (§14.1.9).
     kç$ is absent after verbs in AN categories (including Imperfective
Negative) other than the unsuffixed Imperfective (positive). In the other AN
categories, Nonhuman subject is with 3Sg subject as zero: Perfective (ya&˘-yE$-Ø
‘He/She/It went’, mi@ cE@t-ti $-Ø ‘He/She/It bit me’), Resultative -sa$- (mi@ E@˘-sa$-Ø
‘He/She/It saw me’), -jE$- (n)E˘@ -jE$-Ø ‘He/She/It already ate’), -tE@rE$- (mi@
cE@t-tE@rE$-Ø ‘He/She/It once bit me’), Perfective negative (mi@ cE$l-li@-Ø
‘He/She/It didn’t bite me’), Imperfective Negative (mi@ cE$rE$-go@-Ø ‘He/She/It
won’t bite me’), Habitual (mi@ cE$r-a@˘ra$-Ø ‘He/She/It bites me’), or marked
Imperfective (mi@ cE@t-tç@ƒç$-Ø ‘He/She/It bites me’). In interlinears, I gloss the
zero suffix as “3SgS,” though “3SgS/Nonh” would be more accurate.
     Occasionally there is an preverbal 3rd person or Nonhuman pronoun,
apparently in subject function. In the type exemplified by (589.a), the verb
na@˘-y<E$-Ø might easily be taken as ending in 3Sg subject -Ø, which makes one
wonder why there is also a preverbal L-toned subject pronominal wo$. This is
actually a participial construction, with Nonhuman Participial -Ø indexing an
unexpressed nonhuman head (with a meaning like ‘time’ or ‘situation’).
Therefore it is appropriate for the (non-head) subject to be expressed by an
L-toned pronominal; see (974) and discussion there. In the common expression
(589.b), kç$˘-rç@ ‘it is not (present)’ is already marked for nonhuman subject, so
the preceding H-toned ko@ is redundant. One could argue that the ko@ is topical.

followed by a front vowel e, see §3.5.7.1.
        For /iy/ to i˘, and /uw/ to u˘, see Monophthongization (93) (§3.5.7.2).
        In a practical orthography it would make sense to transcribe -ti $-y instead of
-ti ˘$ -Ø, and -lu@-w instead of -lu@˘-Ø, on grounds of morphological transparency.","[394, 395]"

3.7.2     Grammatical tone patternsGrammatically controlled modifications of lexical tones are of two kinds: Tone-
Grafting (to the end of the stem), see (116), (118), and (131) below, and stem-
wide tone overlays. Grafting does not erase lexical tones, while overlays do.
There are many overlaid tone contours in Jamsay morphosyntax, while grafting
is limited to the tonal locative of nouns (§8.1) and to the unsuffixed Imper-
fective of verbs (§10.1.2.8).
     Overlays themselves are of two kinds. In one, the overlay on the stem is
automatically triggered by a following suffix. In the other, the overlay is
controlled syntactically, though of course this too represents a kind of
dependence on the presence of other elements.
     The beauty of the lexical tones, with at least one H-tone element in every
regular noun, verb, adjective, and numeral stem (§3.7.1), is that one can always
audibly express a morphosyntactic category by converting all tones in the stem
to L (tone-dropping). This happens systematically with nouns (before a mod-
ifying adjective or demonstrative, as head of relative clause, and as initial in
some compound types), adjectives and numerals (as final word in an NP that
heads a relative clause), pronouns (preverbal subject function, possessor with
inalienable kin terms, preceding some particles like Topic ke@), and verbs
(before Negative suffix, unsuffixed Perfective after focalized constituent).
     There are other tone overlays, the most common being H(H…)L, which
occurs in the unsuffixed Perfective of verbs when used in relative clauses, in the
final of some nominal compounds, and in possessed forms of inalienable nouns.
There is an all-H overlay in imperatives of most CvCv- and Cv˘- verbs, and in
the final of some compounds.
     It is no exaggeration to say that grammatical tone changes (along with
grammaticalized intonation) are the central motor of Jamsay morphosyntax.
     Below is a brief summary of the grammatical tone processes applicable to
verbs, nouns, and other word-classes. It is followed by formulations of the
relevant grammatical tone processes. The section on tonology will conclude
with discussion of a number of low-level tone rules.",[125]
"
17.3.4.2 Recognition (inference, hearsay) constructionA different construction of the type ‘see that [proposition]’ denotes recognition
(involving inference or deduction) rather than witnessing (simple perception).
Here, instead of a relative-clause complement, we get one with ordinary AN-
                                        17.3 Factive (indicative) complements   609inflected verbs (any aspect, positive or negative). As in the previous direct-
perception examples, there is no pronominal-subject suffixation on the verb.
However, now a pronominal subject shows up not as an L-toned preverbal
subject pronominal, rather as an H-toned independent pronoun (1036.a-b).
     In my interpretation, the complement no longer has a participle (with
unexpressed nonhuman head), rather a verb inflected for AN but not
pronominal-subject category. In other words, the complement clause is similar
to the subject-focalization construction, except that (in my data) the overt Focus
clitic y$ is not present on the independent pronoun in subject function. (1036.a)
is perfective negative, while (1036.b) is an imperfective negative. (1036.c) has
the ‘it is’ clitic y$ (postconsonantal i^˘). (1036.d), with the same meaning, is a
standard adjectival predicate with ‘be’ quasi-verb.(1036) a. [u@     ya$˘-li@-Ø]     E@˘-ra$-m

           ‘I see (=recognize) that it’s red.’    The equivalent of the recognition construction for ‘hear’ is the hearsay
construction, where the speaker’s evidence is second-hand verbal reports rather
than direct auditory perception.(1037) a. [be@         nu@w<-a^˘]        a@ƒa@-sa$-m

17.3.5 ‘It doesn’t matter (much) that’ (sa$˘-ra@-Ø)sa$˘-ra@-Ø means ‘it doesn’t have’ (§11.5.1). In this invariant form, it may be
placed after a main-like clause (i.e. a factive complement) in the sense ‘it
doesn’t matter (much) that …’. There may be two mutually exclusive factives,
resulting in a parallel construction. (1038) is from a passage about how a
respectable older man keeps an eye out for a potential bride for a younger man
while visiting other villages.(1038) ye@ri^˘       yE$rE$-Ø             ta$Na$         sa$˘-ra@-Ø,

17.3.6 Factive obligational (wa@˘ji@bi $ ‘obligation’)The Fulfulde (ultimately Arabic) noun wa@˘ji@bi $ ‘obligation, duty’ is used as a
predicative nominal with clitic y$ ‘it is’. The following clause has an
imperfective or imperative verb. In effect, wa@˘ji@bi     $ y$ functions like an
adverbial. Alternatively, the complement may appear as a topicalized Verbal
Noun clause, with following wa@˘ji@bi $y$ ‘it is a duty’.(1039) a. [n)u@˘    ke@]    wa@˘ji@bi 

"(60)      Post-Sonorant Syncope (verbs)          A short vowel is deleted (syncopated) if…
              a) it is in the metrically weak second syllable of a (C)vCv stem; and
              b) it is preceded by a (coronal) rhotic {r r<}; and
              c) it is followed by a suffix-initial coronal {t d n s l r} or y, or by
                   Linker ti@ (§15.1.16); and
              d) the first syllable of the (C)vCv stem has a short vowel    Condition (60.a) relates to the comments about abstract metrical structure in
§3.2.2, above. Condition (60.d) is less a dynamic process than a constraint on
Post-Sonorant Syncope designed to prevent adverse consequences, since
syncopating the second vowel of (C)v˘Cv would create a superheavy syllable.
The inclusion of suffix-initial y as a conditioning factor for verbs only in (60.c)
                                             3.5 Segmental phonological rules   57is interesting, but also somewhat circular, since the suffix in question (Per-
fective -yE$-/-ya$-) is itself an allomorph that can only be added to a bisyllabic
stem if this is a syncopating rhotic-medial stem (the suffix can also be added to
Cv˘- monosyllabic stems, §10.1.2.3).
        While Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is almost always implemented in
conversational speech, in formal elicitation I have recorded unsyncopated
variants with suffixes other than Perfective -yE$-/-ya$-.
        Most examples involve AN suffixes. However, the syncope process can
also occur when a verb is followed by Linker ti@ in a verb- or VP-chain
(§15.1.16), as in … ka@n ti@ me$y ‘make … (and …)’ from ka@r<a@- ‘do, make’.
        The process does not apply in nominal compounds: tç$rç$-tu$mo@ ‘mountain
boulder’.
        Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) feeds two other rules that disguise the identity
of an underlying rhotic. Derhoticization (§3.5.5.1) converts r< (which cannot
occur syllable-finally) to n. Rhotic Assimilation (77) (§3.5.5.2) assimilates r
totally to the following coronal consonant, resulting in a geminate, as already
seen in (60), above. Therefore the outputs are nC from underlying /r<vC/, and
geminate C˘ from underlying /rvC/, where C is the coronal. Note that e.g. tt
resulting from Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) can only reflect /rt/, since syncope
does not apply between underlying t’s: ja@tE$ ja@tE@-ti $-Ø ‘he did a calculation’.
        Post-Sonorant Syncope also feeds Rhotic-Cluster Lateralization (79).
        Examples of Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) are ga&y-ya$ ‘pass.Perf’ from stem
ga$ra@- and ye$l-li@- ‘not come.Perf’ from stem yE$rE@- (see next paragraph). There
are many such (C)vC2v- verbs with r or r< as C2, and there are plenty of
coronal-initial AN (aspect-negation) suffixes that can follow them (Perfective
-ti -$ , Resultative -sa$-, Recent Perfect -jE$-, Experiential Perfect -tE@rE$-,
Imperfective -tç@ƒç$-).
        In the case of yE$rE@- ‘come’, Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is irregularly
accompanied by a change in vowel quality from E to e. Thus unsuffixed
Imperfective yE$rE^˘-Ø ‘he/she will come’, Imperfective Negative yE$rE$-go@-Ø
‘he/she will not come’, but suffixed Perfective ye&y-ya$-Ø ‘he/she came’,
ye$l-li@-Ø ‘he/she did not come’, etc. No similar vocalic change occurs with e.g.
bE$rE@- ‘get’.
        The phonological scope of Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) seems to be
expanding, but in a lexicalized way. One expansion is in the direction of
including nasal n along with {r r<} as the preceding consonants that licence
syncope. While most Cvnv- stems do not allow syncope, the important verb
ku@no@- ‘put’ does optionally syncopate before the same coronal-initial suffixes:
ku@no@-ti $- or ku@n-ti -$ ‘put.Perf’. This may have been suggested by the
phonologically (and semantically) similar verb ku@r<o@- ‘put on, wear (garment)’,
which regularly syncopates like other Cvr<v- stems: Perfective ku@n-ti $ ‘wore’.
Because of Derhoticization, the syncopated forms of ku@no@- ‘put’ and of ku@r<o@-
58     Phonology
‘wear’ are homophonous as [ku@n-]. There is no compelling practical need to
distinguish ‘put (object)’ from ‘put on, wear (garment)’, which overlap lexically
in many languages (English put and put on, French mettre).
       Syncopated variants were also occasionally observed with u@no@- ‘put down’
(Perf u@n-ti -$ varying with u@no@-ti $-) and mu$no@- ‘braid’ (Imperfective
mu&n-tç@ƒç$-). Note that ku@no@-, u@no@-, and mu$no@- share a segmental shape
(C)uno- with u in the first syllable. I did not observe syncope with e.g. na$na@-
‘chase away’, pa@na@- ‘butcher’, sa@na@- ‘undo braids’, or pi@ne@- ‘shut (door)’.
       A second extension is in the direction of allowing the first stem syllable to
have a long vowel. There is one Cv˘rv- verb that syncopates, namely jE$˘rE@-
‘bring’. The verb appears in syncopating suffixal environments as /je&r-/, which
invariably undergoes Rhotic Assimilation (77), as in Perfective je&t-ti $- (likewise
je$s-sa$-, je$l-li@-, etc.). The long vowel is shortened and raised from E˘ to e. It
may be that the central irregularity is that jE$˘rE@- is shortened in syncopating
environments; this then undergoes regular Post-Sonorant Syncope (60).
However, there is no shortening of jE$˘rE@- in e.g. Imperfective Negative
jE$˘rE$-go@-, i.e. where the suffix does not begin with a coronal. The lexicalization
of syncopation for jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’ is demonstrated by the failure of the homonym
jE$˘rE@- ‘criticize’ to syncopate: je&t-ti $- ‘bring-Perf’ versus jE$˘rE@-ti -$ ‘criticize-
Perf’. The other case like jE$˘rE@- is the combination of Habitual AN suffix -a@˘ra$-
with following (stative) Negative -la@- (§11.4.3). A form like be@˘-ra$-la@-Ø ‘it
doesn’t happen’ optionally syncopates to be^˘-l-la@-Ø.
       There is one other (optionally) syncopating verb that has both medial n (like
ku@no@- ‘put’) and a long vowel (like jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’), namely mç$˘-nç@- ‘bring
together’ (also ‘gather, assemble’). For example, syncopated Perfective
mç&˘-n-ti -$ varies freely with unsyncopated mç$˘-nç@-ti -$ . Unlike jE$˘rE@-, mç$˘-nç@-
does not shorten its long vowel when it syncopates. mç$˘-nç@- is the causative of
mç$r<ç@- ‘come together’ (50.a), which of course also syncopates.
       Extended exemplification of regular and irregular Post-Sonorant Syncope
(60) with verb-suffix combinations is given in (61), using Perfective allomorphs
-ti -$ or -ya$-. Rhotic Assimilation (77) is also seen in (61.a-b), and Derhoti-

              ‘bring together’ mç$˘-nç@-      mç&˘n-ti -$ (or: mç$˘-nç@-ti -$ )    Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) does not apply when C2 is a consonant (even a
sonorant) other than a rhotic, aside from the few cases of n just mentioned. In
particular, if C2 is l, syncope does not occur: ka@la@-ti -$ ‘park.Perf’, sa@la@-ti $-
‘pray.Perf’. Likewise, if C2 is non-coronal, syncope does not apply before a
cororal C3, hence gç$Nç@-ti -$ ‘spin.Perf’. With the exception of jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’, the
rule does not apply to Cv˘Cv- stems or to trisyllabic stems even if all other
factors are favorable: ga$˘r<a@-ti ‘mix.Perf’, ji $˘rE@-ti -$ ‘mix.Perf’, so@go@ro@-ti $-
‘(unseen object) make a noise.Perf’, ga$ma$r<a@-ti -$ ‘divide.Perf’.
    However, there is a single bisyllabic verb with a medial velar nasal that
undergoes optional syncope when the suffix (or pronominal subject clitic) also
begins with a velar. The verb is ta@Na@- ‘happen’, and the triggering morpheme is
either Imperfective Negative -go@- or (in the unsuffixed Imperfective)
Nonhuman subject pronominal kç$.(62)     a. ta@Na@kç$       = ta@Nkç$        ‘it will happen’
         b. ta$Na$-go@-Ø     = ta$N-go@-Ø      ‘it will not happen’   Since the flanking consonants in ta@Nkç$ and ta$N-go@-Ø constitute
homorganic (velar) nasal-stop pairs, there is a clear similarity between this and
60     Phonology
examples involving coronals in (61), especially ku@n-ti $- in (61.d). Syncope does
not occur when the suffix begins in a non-velar C, such as 3Pl ta@Na@-ba$.
     I have been unable to find examples of Post-Sonorant Syncope (60)
involving labials. The candidates would be verbs like ka@ma@- ‘toss (cowries)’
with 3Pl subject suffix -ba$. However, informants insisted on e.g. imperfective
ka@ma@-ba$ ‘they toss (cowries)’, and I never heard syncopated forms of the type
#ka@m-ba$.
     Another context where Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) occurs is in suffixal
derivation of verbs, when Reversive suffix -rv- is added to a Cvrv- stem (there
is also one example involving a Cvr<v- stem). Here the output of Syncope is
modified by yet another CC-cluster adjustment, this time /rr/ (or /r<r/)
appearing as ll, see Rhotic-Cluster Lateralization (§3.5.5.3, below). In (63.a),
the unsyncopated form of the Reversive is illustrated. In (63.b), we see Post-
Rhotic Symcope and Rhotic-Cluster Lateralization. For more on reversives, see
§9.1.(63)          input     gloss              Reversive     gloss          a. pa@ƒa@-    ‘tie’              pa@ƒa@-ra@-   ‘untie’          b. pi@re@-    ‘get stuck’     pi@l-le-         ‘get unstuck’
             kç@rç@-    ‘hang up, hook’ kç@l-lç@-        ‘unhook’
             ma$r<a@-   ‘be lost’       ma$l-la@-        ‘be recovered    Some apparent cases of syncope can be explained in other ways. For
example, if tE@m-nE@- ‘make (sth) wet’ is interpreted as the causative of tE@mE@-
‘become wet’, syncope must be assumed. However, tE@m-nE@- is more reasonably
explained as a direct verbalization from adjective tE@m ‘wet’.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82]"

15.2.8 ‘From X, until (or: all the way to) Y’The verb ya$Na@ ‘take, pick up’ is widely used to initiate (and continue) a series,
especially in the combination ya$Na@ me$y<. It can take an NP or a clause as
complement. The series is normally concluded with a phrase containing some
combination of ha^l ‘until’, ya&˘- ‘go’, and/or dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’. The trope is
therefore of the speaker ‘picking up’ one or more objects and going (with it) to
a destination.
     One version of the complete construction is seen in (956.a), with two ya$Na
me$y< opening the series of life stages of the millet plant, and a final ha^l ya&˘.

15.3 Constructions with superfluous m a$15.3.1 Narrative-climax construction with ma$ plus H(H…)L PerfectiveIn narrative climaxes, it is possible to shift to a highly marked construction
ending in an unsuffixed perfective verb in H(H…)L tone (as in relatives). We
also find Possessive ma$ connecting various preceding constituents in a
somewhat profligate fashion. A pronominal subject is expressed by an
independent pronoun preceding ma$. A chained verb preceding the H(H…)L
verb has its tones dropped to all-L, in the fashion of a compound initial.
Frequently two such clauses are paired, the first of which undergoes intona-
tional prolongation ().
                                     15.3 Constructions with superfluous ma$   573    Some of these features suggest affinities with Verbal Noun complements
(§17.4.1) and ‘before …’ clauses (§15.2.4.2).
    A free translation with ‘suddenly’ or the like captures the narrative flavor.
When two such clauses are paired, a rapid-fire chronological sequence is
suggested, as in line 4 of (963). The contextual translation is ‘no sooner did …
than …’.(963)   ya$Na@       be$        ka^n en France ya&˘        me$y<

        pi@li@we@-) 2004.4.22    The subject of ‘arrive’ and ‘go back’ nominals is expressed as a possessor,
specifically as an independent pronoun (here 2Sg u@) plus Possessive ma$.
    (964) is an elicited example of the same type.(964)   a@˘ma@du$ ma$ di@Ne$,          wo@ ma$ nu@w<o$

        ‘No sooner did Amadou sit down than he died.’ (di$Ne@-, nu@w<o@-)    Consider now (965). The first clause (‘got up’) is of the same type as in
(963-4), i.e. H(H…)L verb with preceding …ma$, and denotes a sudden action.
After a second clause (‘was holding’) whose form is not relevant here, the
passage concludes with a long third clause of the same type as the first
(‘brought down’). What is interesting about this third clause is that each
constituent is linked to the following by Possessive ma$. Excluding one case
where ma$ occurs in its normal function within a possessed NP, the third clause
may be schematically modeled as [he ma$ top ma$ stick ma$ brought down], i.e.
‘he (suddenly) brought down the stick on the top’. When one does include the

H(H…)L verb and preceding … ma$. In the first, we again see an independent

chained verb (‘kick’ = ‘[scorpion] sting’) before the H(H…)L verb ‘put’. In the

15.3.2 Other cases of superfluous ma$Structurally unnecessary Possessive ma$ occurs in a number of other textual
passages. An example is ma$ before the verb ‘not have’ in (967). My tran-
scription assistant suggested omitting the ma$, but I regard superfluous ma$ as a
                                      15.3 Constructions with superfluous ma$   575stylistic device rather than a grammatical error. Perhaps the fact that the
preceding object NP (‘a place to put them’) is long and cumbersome is a factor
in favor of inserting ma$ before the verb here.(967)   [i n

        2004.3.9     In (968), what appears to be a chained VP ending in ya&˘ ‘go’ is followed,
after an intonation break, by ma$ plus noun. Perhaps ma$ here is an improvised
connective, as the structure of the sentence is adjusted in mid-stream.(968)   … ga@˘ra@         a&-n       ta@na@-Na@-m$,

(‘does not prevent …’). There is an unexpected ma$ between this ku$n-o@-Ø and
the preceding subject NP. Perhaps what is going on here is that the negative

16 Conditional constructions
16.1 Simple conditional with d ey (de$ y , de@ y , de @ ) ‘if’The unmarked simple conditional clause is of the form [S1 dey, S2]. In this
construction, S1 denotes an eventuality that has occurred, does occur, or may
occur. The pitch of dey is variable. When clause-final, it behaves as an atonal
morpheme, which then copies the final tone of the preceding word, see Atonal-
Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137). Because of the way H- and L-tones pattern
with AN suffixes, in practice we get de@y after negative verbs (if not
defocalized) and after lexical-stem pseudo-participles, but de$y in the more
common combination with a preceding positive verb.
     When non-clause-final (i.e. when followed by another particle), the basic
form is H-toned de@y. In some high-frequency combinations this simplifies to de@
(§16.1.3).
     Both antecedent and consequent clauses have main-clause form in the
great majority of cases, so their verbs have pronominal suffixes as appropriate.
dey occurs at the end of the antecedent clause, which normally precedes the
consequent, though occasional textual examples of postposed antecedent
clauses (probably afterthoughts) have turned up. The construction is very
common, and one can often translate dey as ‘when …’ instead of as ‘if’. In
other words, [S1 dey, S2] may simply indicate chronological ordering, as in the
description of a complex activity involving multiple sequential actions, so long
as there is some connection between these actions (a necessary sequencing, for
example). The [S1 dey, S2] construction therefore competes with the explicitly
temporal [[S1 (ga@˘) ka^n], S2] construction (§15.2.2.1).","[588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598]"

17.6.4 ‘So that …’ or ‘had better’ (v# + -m)There is a purposive construction of the type (1088). Here the purposive (‘so
that …’) clause follows the main clause, or at least does so often. This sets this
construction apart from other subordinated clauses, which precede (or are
embedded in) the main clause.(1088) [main clause]     [… v# + -m]     For examples see (1091-3) later in this section. The notation [v# + -m]
means that the verb has its lexical tones (though an R-toned monosyllable may
be heard as L-toned), and is followed by an atonal suffix -m that acquires its
surface tone from the preceding morpheme. The tonal pattern distinguishes the
current construction from the Hortative, which has an H-toned -m@ suffix after a
tone-dropped all-L stem, i.e. [v$ + -m@] (§10.4.3).
     A pronominal subject is expressed with a clause-initial independent
pronoun, arguably a presentential topic.
     The sense ‘had better’ or ‘must’ is expressed by combining [… v# + -m]
with ti@la^yy$ ‘it is an obligation’ (< noun ti@la^y). We see this in the extended
passage (1089). The verb tE@mE@- ‘find’ has its lexical HH tones before -m, hence
tE@mE@-m. The HH tone contour makes it clear that this is not a plural participle
(cf. Perfective tE@mE$-m, Imperfective tE@mE@-m$), and that it is not a 1Sg subject
form (Perfective tE$mE$-m, Imperfective tE@mE@-m$).

the bush, under the watchful gaze of their elders, to demonstrate that they were
properly armed for fighting (or for taking on wild animals). The force of the
repeated tE@mE@-m is captured by ‘they had better find …’, where ‘they’ (not
expressed overtly) is generic.
      Follow-up elicitation produced examples (1090), where the subject (agent)
of ‘find’ is expressed as an independent pronoun (perhaps topicalized) at the
left.

This chapter covers the morphosyntax of antecedent-anaphor relationships:
reflexive, topic-indexing, logophoric, and reciprocal.
      The forms i $ni w
                      $ <e@ (e.g. reflexive object) and E$nE@ (e.g. reflexive possessor,
logophoric) may be related to each other and to the noun i@ne@- ‘person’ (e.g. Sg
i@ne@-n). E$nE@ has a dialectal variant i n$ e@-. Both i n $ i $w<e@ and E$nE@ are morpho-
logically nouns rather than pronouns. They may be followed by regular
nominal postpositions, but do not have special dative clitic forms like those of
true personal pronouns, E$nE@ (but not i n      $ i $w<e@) may be pluralized by adding
particle be@.","[656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664]"

19.1.3 ‘Also, even’ (ka^˘<, ka@r<a$)The morpheme meaning ‘also, too’ (see below for ‘even’) is usually heard as
ka^˘<, which can easily be confused with the distributive quantifier ka^˘< ‘each,
any’. However, the particle meaning ‘also’ has a variant ka@r<a$ that is not shared
with the quantifier. In addition, the ‘each, any’ quantifier occurs in a more
limited set of morphosyntactic combinations, e.g. with a preceding unmodified
noun or a preceding relative clause, and it induces tone-dropping in the
preceding word (§6.1.4, §6.8.1). The ‘also, even’ particle occurs after a wide
range of phrases and clause-finally, and has no tonal effect on a preceding
word.
     ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ variants are interchangeable. However, ka@r<a$ seems to
occur chiefly after a pronoun or other NP. ka^˘< is more common in all positions,
but seems especially dominant in clause-final position (with clausal scope), and
in the high-frequency combination ka^˘< nE$ with nE$ ‘now’. The variant ka@r<a$
should be distinguished from the common verb ka@r<a@- ‘do’, which appears as
the form ka@r<a$-Ø in perfective relative clauses with Nonhuman head NP.
     For examples of ka^˘< in the sense ‘also, too’ see (217), (280.b), (435.c),
(556.a), (641), (671.b), (740.b), (749), (795.b), etc. For ka@r<a$ in this sense see
(315.b), (1152.a-b).
     The constituent that the ‘also’ particle has scope over is not always topical,
but it may be (1152).(1152) a. [n)E&˘-r<-u$m        ka@r<a$], a$ra@      nç$˘-w<ç@-n         de@y, …

in the same text as mi@ ka^˘<.
     The sense ‘also’ is closely related to that of ‘even’, the only difference
being that ‘even’ presupposes the unlikelihood of one out of two (or more)
parallel events differing in at least one substantive component. The distinction is
made in English but not in Jamsay, where ka^˘< and ka@r<a$ may be translated
either way depending on context. The choice of translations is fairly arbitrary in
cases like ‘even today’ (= ‘today too’) following a discussion of past practices
(1153.a). The sense ‘even’ may be reinforced by ha^l ‘until, to the point that’

8.5.3.3    ‘Specifically’ (te@, pa@, ja@˘ti )$An adverbial te@ (with exaggerated prolongation represented by ) is added
to NPs or adverbials in the identificational sense ‘precisely’. The NP or
adverbial is often but not always topicalized. The context involves narrowing
down from a more general to a very exact reference. A gloss ‘specifically’ or

8.5.4     Evaluation8.5.4.1     ‘Well’ and ‘badly’There is no dedicated adverbial meaning ‘well’ or ‘badly’. As in standard
Arabic, the equivalent sense is often expressed by adding an adjective ‘good’ or
‘bad’ to a cognate object (493).(493)     [wa$ru$    E$ju@]     wa$ra^˘-Ø
          [farming.L good]      farm.Impf-3SgS
          ‘He/She farms well.’ (wa@ru@)    Or, the evaluative adjective ‘good’ or ‘bad’ may be predicative. This is
always possible since verbal nouns (and similar nominals) are abundant.(494)     [wo@   jo@w]        E$ju$-la@-Ø
          [3SgP running]      good-Neg-3SgS
          ‘He/She runs poorly’ (lit. “His/Her running is not good”)    Adverb E$ji@< (§8.5.2) may have the contextual meaning ‘well’. Morpho-
logically, one could argue that it is still connected to E$ju@ ‘good’, but the
semantic connection is weak and the morphology would be obscure.

8.5.4.2    ‘Appropriate, right’ (ja@˘<)A culturally important adverbial is ja@˘<, which means ‘normal, appropriate,
(socially) acceptable, right’ with respect to behavior. It usually appears as a
predicate with Nonhuman subject (kç$) referring to the behavior, and may take
a dative to specify the person or group for whom the behavior is normal.(497)     [ja@N    ka^˘< nE$] ja$Na@-ba$,      be$-ru@  ja@˘<kç$

     In (498.a), ja@˘< and ja$˘<-la@- occur in parallel positive and negative relative-
clause predicates. The positive form treats ja@˘< as an adjectival predicate
without the ‘be’ quasi-verb. It is therefore itself subject to the H(H…)L tonal

8.5.5     Epistemic modalsThe predicative noun ti@la^y ‘obligation, necessity’, used in deontic modals (‘X

‘sometimes’) is a double conditional (antecedent and consequent first positive,

17.1.2 ‘Say that …’ with inflectable ‘say’ verb (ga@˘-, jE$-)A special feature of Jamsay discourse is the role of ‘say’ verb ga@˘- and quasi-
verb jE$- (see §11.3.1-2 for the forms). They occur not only in plainly quotative
contexts, but also in constructions that overlap functionally with temporal
adverbial clauses.
     A simple quotative verb like ga@˘- or jE$- may be added to an otherwise
complete sentence, with no other overt indication of quotation status (999). In
imperfective and/or negative contexts, a form of ga@˘- is used (the unsuffixed
Imperfective is ga^- with short vowel). In perfective positive contexts, the only
pronominally inflectable ‘say’ (quasi-)verb is L-toned jE$- (unsuffixed
Perfective). The use of the unsuffixed Perfective suggests that the verb itself (or
at least its aspectual value) is defocalized.(999)    a. [ye$-le@  a$r<a@     mi&n-sa$-Ø]             jE$-Ø

complement (§17.3) rather than a (normal) quotative complement is present.

17.1.3 Quotative clitic waThis uninflectable clitic occurs after a quotation, and (for some speakers) as a
hearsay evidential in tales and in reports of long-past practices known only from
oral tradition. In texts, the tone is normally carried forward from the final tone
of the preceding word, so we hear wa@ after H-tone and wa$ after L-tone. In texts,
the pitch of wa is sometimes higher than that of a preceding L-tone. I am
inclined to take this as an intonational effect and transcribe wa$.
     wa is used after a more or less verbatim quotation, not in examples like
‘what did he/she say?’ with an NP rather than a quotation as complement. It
presupposes a contextually understood 3Sg (less often 3Pl) speaker. It can
therefore often be glossed ‘he/she said’ at the end of a quotation. However, the
“speaker” is sometimes impersonal or generalized (‘it is said’, ‘they say’). The
quotation is usually from a past speech event, so wa competes most directly
with third person forms of quasi-verb jE$-, especially 3Sg jE$-Ø ‘he/she said’.
However, wa can also occur after a quotation attributed to a future time.(1001) a. [ma^˘n         ma$        n)E-& n]
          [so-and-so     Poss       woman-Sg]

       [2SgS.L meal]      eat-Reslt    say
       ‘He said that you-Sg [focus] ate the meal.’    Clause-final Emphatic particles such as ko$y that were part of the original
quotation follow rather than precede wa@ (1003). A similar example with
Emphatic de@ is in Text 2.

8 Postpositions and adverbials
Jamsay makes use of postpositions for dative and spatiotemporal cases. The
purest postposition, bearing no relationship to any noun, is le$, which has several
grammatical functions. Several other postpositions are based on noun stems.
These include complex postpositions that themselves consist of a noun plus
postposition, requiring a complement in the form of a possessor (cf. English at
the back of…). There are also some postpositions in the form of a noun with an
overlaid locative H(H…)L tone melody (tonal locatives).
     A postpositional phrase (PP) is of the basic form [NP Postposition], but it
may be extended by adding a universal quantifier cE^w or fu@˘ ‘all’ (in emphatic
sense), or by a particle like ka^˘< ‘also’. (435.a) has fu@˘ after a PP, in a different
sense than we get when fu@˘ occurs at the end of the NP complement of the
postposition (435.b). (435.c) illustrates ka^˘< ‘also’ (§19.1.3). (435.d) has cE^w
‘all’ after a PP, and also shows how a PP can be treated like a noun, specifically
as a (descriptive) “possessor” with following Possessive ma$.(435)   a. [a$na@   ku$<] bE@rE$          fu@˘

numerous lexical adverbials in Jamsay. Some of these are noun-like, e.g. words
with senses like ‘yesterday’, which (in their adverbial function) can be thought
of as covert PPs with a zero postposition, just as in English (yesterday for ?on
yesterday). However, there are other adverbials of a more protean variety, not
easily connected to any other stem-class. These include intensifiers associated
with adjectives (§6.3.3.2), and an interesting set of expressive adverbials, some
examples of which are given in §8.5.8. The intensifiers and expressive
adverbials resemble regular adjectives in their ability to occur in predicative
function with a following ‘be’ quasi-verb, but even here the similarity is
superficial, in that the usual negative (‘not be’) counterparts are different; see
§11.4.3. Adverbials, even though some have adjective-like sense (e.g. ‘straight’,
‘tilting’), are not used in adnominal modifying function and do not take number
suffixes.","[303, 304, 305]"
"
10.1.2.11 Habitual (-a@˘ra$-)Since this suffix is vowel-initial, and is always added to a vowel-final stem,
contraction of the two vowels must occur. Verbs of more than one syllable end
in short vowels, and this short vowel is lost before the suffixal a@˘. Example:
bi r$ E@-, Habitual bi $r-a@˘ra$-. Monosyllabic verbs preserve their vowel-quality in
the contraction: de@˘- ‘carry’, Habitual de@˘-ra$- (not #d-a@˘ra$-). See discussion of
VV-Contraction (90) in §3.5.6.2.
       One can argue whether the suffix should be underlying /-a@ra$-/ or /-a@˘ra$-/.
This is the only vowel-initial suffix used with verbs, and it always undergoes
VV-Contraction.
       The aspectual value of -a@˘ra$- is not consistently distinguishable from that of
the unsuffixed Imperfective or of the form with suffix -tç@ƒç$-. In the majority of
364     Verbal inflection
textual examples, -a@˘ra$- occurs in connection with actions that are recurrent,
habitual, or otherwise stable over a period of time.(575)     a. cE$˘       be$         bi $r-a@˘ra$y$

10.1.2.12 Stative -i^˘A Stative suffix -i^˘ is attested with verbs of opening and shutting (pi@ne@- ‘shut’
and le@˘- ‘shut [door]’), along with their reversive derivatives (the regular
pi@ni@-r<e@- ‘open’ and the irregular li@l-le@- ‘open’). The form with -i^˘ has an
intransitive stative-resultative sense ‘be open’ or ‘be shut’, with a third person
subject denoting ‘doorway’ or the like. For bisyllabic or longer verbs, the stem-
final vowel contracts with the suffixal vowel, and the remainder of the stem
drops its tones, so we get Cv$(C)(Cv$)C-i^˘ with a L…<HL> contour, as in pi n       $ -i^˘
‘be shut’, pi n$ i $-r<-i^˘ ‘be open’, and li $ll-i^˘ ‘be open’. With a Cv˘ monosyllabic
verb, we get Cv$y@y$ (arguably Cv$i ^˘ but in one syllable) with the same contour
compressed into a single <LHL> syllable, hence le$-y@y$ ‘be shut, (garment) be
tied on’.
     This Stative category stands outside of the regular perfective and imper-
fective systems. Verbs with this suffix behave like defective stative verbs, and
are negated by adding the Negative particle la$˘- (3Pl la$˘-ba$) to the positive
stem. Cf. Negative la$˘ after the ‘it is’ clitic, hence y$ la$˘ ‘not be’ (§11.2.1.3),
and the more versatile (stative) Negative la$ with short vowel (§11.2.1.4).(577)    a. mç$˘-ka@˘   pi n

      Given its negative morphosyntax and its tone contour, it is likely that
Stative -i^˘ originated as a special case of the ‘it is’ clitic (allomorphs y$ and
i $˘), added to the Verbal Noun (§4.2.2.1, e.g. pi n      $ -u@ ‘shutting’, le$-y@ ‘shutting’).
However, this is not transparently correct as a synchronic analysis.","[385, 386, 387, 388]"

11.2.4 Stative stance verbs da$˘<- ‘be sitting’, u$mo$- ‘be lying down’In active senses, ‘sit down’ is di $Ne@- and ‘lie down, go to bed’ is i n$ e) -@ . These are
basically regular verbs with complete imperfective and perfective paradigms.
One shared irregularity is that both have Imperative stems that preserve the LH
tone contour of the lexical form, whereas other short-voweled Cv$Cv@ bisyllables
(except ya$Na@- ‘look’) have HH-toned imperatives (§10.4.1). The Imperative
stems are di N$ e@ and i n
                         $ )e@.
    A few examples involving di N            $ e@- ‘sit down’ will illustrate its basic
regularity. (689.a) contains both an unsuffixed Imperfective di N                $ e^- and a
suffixal Perfective -di N  $ -a^˘-. (689.b) has an L-toned unsuffixed Perfective, while
(689.c) is a Perfective Negative.(689)     a. [be@     ne$]     yE$rE@     di $Ne@-ba$,

form, it is probably related to di $Ne@- rather than da$˘<- (whose regular causative
would have been #da$˘<-w<a@-); see (531.b) in §9.2). I was able to elicit no
causative based directly on stative u$mo$- ‘be lying down’. Again, the active
rather than the stative verb is input to the causative: i $ne) @- ‘lie down’, causative
in$ )i $-w<e@- ‘cause to lie down, put to sleep’.","[444, 445, 446, 447]"

Imperfective Negative -go@- and Perfective Negative -li@-, which (like the
positive unsuffixed Perfective) may appear in a word-level L-toned form (i.e.
with -go$- or -li -$ ) when aspect is defocalized. Similarly, participles that include
lexical or grammatical H-tone components drop these tones before modifying
elements that regularly force tone-dropping on a preceding modified noun, e.g.
ka^˘< ‘any, each’; see e.g. (843.a-c) in §14.1.18.

14.2.2 AgentivesSome subject relatives, generally consisting of a simple Imperfective participial
verb without complements, function as agentives.
     An example is verb da$na@- ‘hunt’, unsuffixed Imperfective stem da$na^-,
Agentive da$na@-n$ ‘hunter’ (Pl da$na@-m$). There is no formal difference between
‘hunter’ and the imperfective relative clause ‘one who hunts’ (§4.2.3).
     However, we can partially distinguish agentives from ordinary subject
relatives when the agentives are extended by incorporating an object noun, or
other complement or adverbial. Here a true agentive takes one of two tone
contours, each associated with a type of noun-noun compound. One type
(§5.1.7), identical in form to subject relatives, is [x# v^-Ppl], where the (loosely)
incorporated element x has its regular tone, and the participial verb has
H(H…)L tone (850.a). The other type (§5.1.9, with many examples), clearly
                                                   14.3 Object relative clause   509distinguishable from ordinary subject relatives, is a more tightly fused
[x$-v@-Ppl], where the incorporated element has its tones dropped to all-L, and the
verb shifts to all-H tone (850.b).(850)   a. u$-ju$w<o@     da@na$-m

14.3 Object relative clause14.3.1 Ordinary object relative clauseIn object relatives and other non-subject relatives, if the subject is not expressed
by a nonpronominal NP, it appears as an L-toned subject pronominal
immediately preceding the participle. An example is (851), which also
illustrates the H(H…)L tone contour on the unsuffixed Perfective participle.(851)   [cE$˘     u$         bi@rE$-Ø]               ce@˘n-a^˘
        [thing.L 2SgS.L      work.Perf.HL-Ppl.Nonh] be.good-Reslt
        ‘what you-Sg have accomplished is very good’    More nonhuman object relatives are in (852). The head noun and the
Participial suffix are bolded in interlinears. L-toned preverbal subject
pronominals appear in most of the examples, and are italicized in interlinears.
These subject pronominals make it relatively easy to identify the head NP as the
object. In (852.c), however, both subject and object are expressed as
nonpronominal (i.e. noun-headed) NPs. Clues that ‘cattle’ is the object, rather
than subject, are: a) the Nonhuman zero suffix on the participle, b) the fact that
nonpronominal NPs follow subject-object order, and c) the subject-object
animacy asymmetry of the verb ‘chase, drive ahead’.

an additional external head is (800.e), involving a cognate nominal.
    See also the discussion of object relatives functioning as instrumental and
similar compound-like nouns (‘oil for rubbing’) in §5.1.15.
14.3.2   ‘what they call “X”’The verb ga@˘- ‘say’ may be used in a special type of object relative. This
construction is very common in interview-style texts where an expert speaker is
explaining e.g. agricultural techniques, and periodically introduces technical or
archaic vocabulary. Jamsay ‘what they call “X”’ can be freely glossed as ‘so-
called X’. The subject is 3Pl (nonspecific referentially), the verb is a participle
based on Perfective ga^- with H(H…)L contour, and Definite ku$< is regularly
added. With zero suffix, ga^- is lengthened by ga^˘-Ø by Contour-Tone Mora-
Addition (141). The quoted term has its normal tones, and is therefore not the
head NP. Therefore, when no obvious object NP is present, as in (853.a), a zero
object functioning as relative head is posited. In (853.b), an object NP ‘women’
(the third word in the example) is an overt direct-object head. The quoted term
is therefore an adjunct and is neither relative head nor direct object.(853)    a. ko@y$       [mo$n)u-$ cE&m     be$      ga^˘-Ø             ku$<]

14.4 Relative clause from ‘it is’ clitic constructionThe construction [Xy$] ‘it is X’ and its negation [Xy$ la$˘] (§11.2.1) allow the
predicative constituent X to be relativized on. The negative version occurred (as
part of a double negative) in a text (854); examples given earlier are (360.a-b).

          [tree.L    medicineit.is] be.Nonh-Neg
          ‘There is no tree that is medicine.’    This example is structurally interesting. ‘Tree’ shows the tone-dropping
typical of relatives. Since a relative clause is at hand, there should be a
Nonhuman Participial suffix -Ø. However, there is no verb, or even a quasi-verb
capable of taking Participial suffixes. This is “finessed” in (855), since the
relevant Participial suffix is phonetically inaudible (zero). What happens when
we force the issue by using a human head NP? Consider the simple ‘it is’ clause
(856).(856)     n)E&-n       ç$ƒç$-ni^˘
          woman-Sg chief-Sgit.is
          ‘A woman is (the) chief.’     When I tried to elicit a relative clause version, as in ‘there is no woman who
is chief’, informants altered the construction rather than put Singular Participial
-n on the clitic y$ (allomorph i^˘). They either used compounds (e.g. ‘there is
no woman-chief’), or switched from relative clause to factive complement
(857).(857)     [n)E&-n        ç$ƒç$-ni^˘]       kç$˘-rç@
          [woman-Sg      chief-Sgit.is]    be.Nonh-Neg
          ‘That a woman be chief, it does not exist.’    Note that ‘woman’ in (857) does not undergo tone-dropping; it is in the
form of a main-clause subject (or topic) rather than a relative-clause head. I
conclude that there is a morphological constraint against combining y$ ‘it is’
with nonzero Participial suffixes, but that relatives with nonhuman head are
allowed (“tolerated” might be a better word) since their zero Participial does not
force the constraint to be audibly violated.
                                                14.5 Possessor relative clause   513    There is no problem in forming human participles (with audible suffixes)
based on the negative ‘it is not’ construction, since here the Participial suffix is
added to Negative la$˘ (allomorph la$-) rather than directly to the ‘it is’ clitic.
Therefore in (858) ‘woman’ appears in tone-dropped form, as head of a relative
clause.(858)   [n)E$-n        o$ƒç$-ni^˘  la$-n]          kç$˘-rç@

14.5 Possessor relative clausePossessor relatives are covered here, since their structure is relevant to the
discussion of relatives based on complex postpositions (§14.6.2, below).
     Three constructions are possible for possessor relatives. In the first,
recorded once in a text, the possessor noun undergoes tone-dropping. Possessive
ma$ is not present. In (859), i n    $ e$ ga$sE$gE@ could be mistaken for a compound
(L-toned initial, lexical-toned final), but this would make no sense. Perhaps this
uncommon first construction is a slightly truncated version of the third (see
below). If so, i n
                 $ e$ and ga$sE$gE@ in (859) should be considered as two constituents
that just happen to be adjacent, rather than as constituting a single constituent
(possessed NP).(859)   sa$na@      [i n
                        $ e$     ga$sE$gE@ be$     na@na$-m]i ˘^

        ‘Is it necessarily (=specifically) the people whose animals they (=Fulbe)
        have driven off (=rustled) [focus] who get up (and fight the Fulbe)?’
        2004.4.25     In the second construction, obtained in elicitation (see below), the regular
possessed NP phrase [X ma$ Y] ‘the Y of X’ is preserved intact, except that (as
relative head) the possessor X undergoes tone-dropping (860.a).
     In the third construction, observed in a text and in elicitation (see below)
and evidently the productive pattern, the possessor is extracted (or at least
separated) from the possessed NP phrase and placed to its left (not necessarily
directly adjacent). This possessor NP (as relative head) undergoes tone-
dropping. Its original place within the possessed NP phrase is occupied by a
resumptive third person possessor (Singular, Plural, or Nonhuman) in its
514     Relativization
regular form (H-toned for alienable, L-toned for inalienable possession). The
resumptive pronominal is not Reflexive/Logophoric in form.
    In elicitation, my assistant gave (860.a) and (860.b) as interchangeable.
(860.a) has the second construction with [X ma$ Y], while (860.b) illustrates the
more common third type showing extraction and a resumptive possessor
pronominal.(860)     a. [i n

             [= (a)]    Textual examples of the third, extraction pattern are in (861.a-d). In these
examples the extracted possessor is adjacent to the pronominally possessed
noun. (861.e) is an elicited example involving an inalienable noun. The
possessed NP happens to be a subject in (861.a-c), the complement of a
postposition in (861.d), and a direct object in (861.e).(861)     a. bu$ro$    [ko@      le$gu@] E@ju$-Ø

separated from the possessor by an adverb (862.a) or by another NP (862.b). In

14.6 PP relative clause14.6.1   With simple postpositionIn PP relatives, only the NP complement of the postposition is logically
relativized on, as is brought out by English translations with stranded
prepositions (‘the housex that I live in __x’). However, in Jamsay, both the
postposition and the complement NP undergo tone-dropping. The usual
general features of relativization are also applicable: Participial suffix on the
verb agreeing with the head, preverbal L-toned subject pronominal, and
H(H…)L tone overlay on a (positive) unsuffixed Perfective verb.
     The first set of examples (863) involve the all-purpose postposition le$
(§8.2.1). Since le$ is already L-toned, we cannot observe audible tone-dropping
on it, but tones are audibly dropped on the preceding noun (or noun modifier).(863)    a. [cE$˘      le$] la@˘    ko$         tu@mno@kç$-Ø

such unsuffixed Perfectives. The AN category (perfective positive) is typically
predictable in such narratives. I suspect that this is a major reason why the
""defocalized"" unsuffixed Perfective is common in narratives. Some degree of
predictability of the verb stem’s semantic content is perhaps a contributing
factor. However, in cases like ‘stripped them off’ in (550.a), the verb denotes a
new event.
    After a quotation, ‘say’ is rather light semantically. While the basic ‘say’
verb ga@˘- has a full set of AN forms including imperfectives, there is also a
common ‘say’ quasi-verb jE$- used only in the L-toned, unsuffixed Perfective
(§11.3.2).
    All of this suggests that, within the perfective system, the unsuffixed
Perfective in main clauses is associated with verb defocalization. This is an
elusive concept, relevant to the grammars of many languages, but with much
language-specific detail. In Jamsay it involves any one of the situations in (551).(551)     a. the verb is part of a large defocalized clausal residue (when some
             other constituent is focalized);          b. the perfectivity of the verb is contextually predictable and there-
             fore defocalized (as in the middle of narratives where many events
             are recounted in chronological order, in perfective aspect); perhaps
             low information value of the verb’s own content is also a con-
             tributing factor;

4.3     Pronouns4.3.1    Basic personal pronounsThe basic personal pronouns are those in (191). “3Sg” and “3Pl” denote

in verbal inflection, the 3Sg subject suffix -Ø agrees with human or nonhuman
referents. The exception is that in the (positive) unsuffixed Imperfective,
nonhuman subject is expressed by adding cliticized kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ to the
verb stem (§10.1.2.8, §10.2.2).
     The independent form, arguably basic morphologically, is used
independently, for direct object (always preverbal), complement of postposition
(other than dative), and possessor of ordinary (alienable) noun. All independent
pronominals are high-toned.
     Subject category is expressed either by an inflectional suffix (the [Verb-_ ]
column) or by a preverbal pronoun (the [ _Verb] column). With rare
exceptions (§10.2.2), the two do not co-occur. The preverbal pronoun occurs in
relatives and some other subordinated clauses. The suffixed pronominal occurs
in ordinary main clauses, except that subject-focus constructions (which have a
focused subject pronoun or noun, usually at the beginning of the clause) have no
suffix.
     The (unfocalized) preverbal subject forms in (191) are segmentally identical
to independents, except that the tone is dropped to L. The preverbal subject
pronominals are therefore identical to the prenominal inalienable possessor
pronominals (rightmost column). The pronominal-subject suffixes are at best
loosely related to any of the other pronominal series. Note in particular that the
nonsuffixal 3Pl forms are all be@ (or L-toned be$) versus 2Pl e@ (or e$), but in the
pronominal-subject suffixes -be is 2Pl, while 3Pl is expressed as -ba (reducing
to -e or -a after a Negative suffix). For more on the subject suffixes, see §10.2.
                                                                4.3 Pronouns    157      The dative has its own special series of pronominal forms in -n (1Sg and
1Pl, with rising tone) or -ru@ (2nd/3rd person), bearing no obvious
morphological relationship to the regular Dative postposition le$ used after
noun-headed NPs. The forms ending in -ru@ often undergo Post-Sonorant
Syncope (60) before a coronal consonant, deleting the u vowel, e.g. 3Pl Dative
be$-ru@ ‘for them’ becoming /be&-r/ (with R-tone). The r then assimilates to the
coronal, hence be&-t ti@me@-sa$ ‘it resembled them’, see Rhotic Assimilation (77).
1Sg mi&-n and 1Pl E$mE&-n may derive historically (by apocope) from *mi $-r<u@
and *E$mE$-r<u@, see §3.5.4.
      Possessor pronominals are in two series. Some kin terms take a special
inalienable possessor series that is identical in form to the L-toned preverbal
subject series; the noun itself shows a {HL} tone overlay. Example: mi $ de^˘ ‘my
father’. Other nouns take H-toned alienable possessor pronouns (and no tone
overlay). The alienable possessor series are identical to independent pronouns,
except that there are special alienable possessor forms for 1Sg (ma@) and 2Sg
(a@). For more on possessive constructions, including tonal overlays, see §4.2.
      There are other syntactic contexts that induce stem-wide tone-dropping
(noun before modifying adjective, noun as head of a relative clause, verb stem
before Negative suffix). One could therefore take the preverbal subject and
inalienable-possessor forms as grammatically identical to independent pro-
nouns, but subject to a morpho-phonological rule dropping H-tones to all-L
tones on preverbal subject and inalienable possessor pronominals.","[177, 178, 179]"

3.7.4.7    Clitic <LHL>-ReductionThe ‘it is’ or Focus clitic, in the postconsonantal allomorph i^˘, would be
expected to surface with <LHL> tone (requiring an extra mora of duration by
Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141)) in two situations (155).(155)     a. after Final-Tone Resyllabification (148) with R-tone
                 e.g. Cv&Ci^˘   >        Cv$Ci& ˘$ (= Cv$Ci i$ i@ $)          b. after VV-Contraction (90) with stem-final L-tone
                 e.g. Cv@˘Cv$i^˘ >     Cv@˘Ci& ˘$ (= Cv@˘Ci $i@i $)     In both cases, we expect <LHL> because a stem-final L-tone component
has become de-linked from the stem itself and has presumably been pushed to
the right. In (155.a), Final-Tone Resyllabification (148) de-links an L-tone
component because, after resyllabification triggered by the clitic, the stem-final
syllable now has only one mora and cannot support a contour tone. In (155.b), a
stem-final L-toned short vowel is lost by contraction.
     In fact, we never get a trimoraic <LHL> syllable in the ‘it is’ or Focus
clitic. In the situations described, instead of <LHL> we get monotonal L. In
effect, the H sandwiched between two L’s is deleted, in this clitic only (156).(156)         gloss         without clitic    with clitic          a. ‘milk’         E^m               E@mi $˘

3.8     Intonation contours3.8.1    Phrase and clause--final nonterminal contours (, , , )In normal conversational speech, there is a general downdrift of pitch toward
the end of clauses. Tonal oppositions are less important functionally in the final
word or two of most clauses, and phonetic expression of tone oppositions is less
clear here. For example, a negative verb form like yE$rE$-go@-Ø ‘he/she won’t
come’ has a less prominent pitch rise (and sometimes no audible rise at all) on
the final syllable when it occurs at the end of a long utterance. It can be difficult
to distinguish the effects of this downdrift from those of grammatically
controlled tone-dropping.
     Clause-final pitch modulation, and prolongation of final syllables or
segments, are used for intonational purposes in a manner familiar from other
languages. For example, there are characteristic nonterminal contours that
suggest that the utterance is not yet complete. This can be used for nonfinal
elements in lists (whether these elements are words, phrases, or clauses), and for
nonfinal VPs in the chains that are so characteristic of Jamsay speech.
     In tape transcriptions, I use the symbols and symbol combinations in (158)
at the end of intonational units (usually clauses) to indicate pitch and duration
on the final syllable or segment of the unit.(158)                      prolongation with no unusual pitch change
                           higher-than-usual pitch with no prolongation
                          prolongation with unusually high pitch
                          prolongation with a gradual drop in pitch     Of course, pitch and duration are gradient rather than categorical in nature.
Still, however crude these symbols are, they give some idea of how clauses and
phrases are related to each other intonationally.
                                                      3.8 Intonation contours   135    , , and  are broadly interchangeable functionally, as all can suggest
that more is to come.  is phonetically somewhat like the dying-quail
intonation (symbol ) described below, but involves a higher initial pitch. It is
used with ma (ma@, ma$), chiefly in its function as an interrogative marker.
    (159) is a portion of an extended sequence of clauses illustrating list
intonation, with the final syllable of each clause lengthened, while maintaining
terminal pitch at a higher than normal level. The rhetorical point is that all sorts
of gear are taken to the hunt. The English equivalent would involve putting
extra stress on the nouns.(159)   ma$lfa^˘<          ja&˘-ba$,

3.8.2   Adverbials and particles with lexically specified prolongation ()A number of particles and expressive adverbs are pronounced with
exaggerated prolongation of the final segment. Most are H-toned, like de@m
‘straight’, but there are also some like pa@ta$ ‘wide and flat’ with final L-tone.
     The lexical  intonation is most conspicuous when the form is free of
clitics, i.e., clause- or phrase-final, or is used as a free adverb. It can also be
heard in attenuated form when the forms are predicative, with a following ‘be’
quasi-verb like Nonhuman kç$ ‘it is’.

usual case for C-final stems. This is the usual pattern. However, sa@m
‘(strangle) to death’ has intonational prolongation of the vowel. Another
example of this minority type is si@me@y< ‘jutting out’.
     In the case of fu@˘ ‘all’, my impression is that there is a wide phonetic range
ranging from ordinary Cv˘ articulation to a conspicuously prolonged fu@˘.
Obviously a universal quantifier lends itself to emphatic intonational effects,
whatever its lexical form. I am less confident of intonational marking with this
form than with the others, and I will often transcribe simply fu@˘ unless I hear an
extra prolongation that justifies fu@˘.","[155, 156, 157, 158]"

        d. (quasi-)focalization type
             verb inflected for AN category but not for pronominal subject;
             unsuffixed Perfective verb has all-L tones;
             pronominal subject expressed by H-toned independent pronoun;
             direct object not in possessor or compound-initial form.                examples:
                  focalization construction (chapter 13);
                  ‘see’ complement in recognition sense (§17.3.4.2).        e. strong-nominalization type
             verb is nominalized;
             no AN categories expressed;
             object expressed as compound initial or as alienable possessor;
             subject expressed as alienable possessor if no object intervenes;
             if object present, pronominal subject expressed as outer possessor              examples:
                 ‘before …’ construction (§15.2.4.2);
                 Verbal Noun clause (§17.4).        f. compound type
             object and verb are fused into a compound of type [n$ v^]              example:
                 reduced purposive clause in compound form (§17.6.3)
3 Phonology
3.1     GeneralThe prosodic structure, involving tone patterns and vocalic lengthening, is
deeply intertwined with the morphosyntax. The segmental phonology has some
intricacies, but there are few disfiguring phonological processes that make it
difficult to identify stems and other morphemes in texts. Exception: Post-
Sonorant Syncope (60) and the consonantal assimilation rules that it feeds can
disguise the identity of (C)vCv- words and stems. An example of this is bE$rE@-
‘get’, Perfective Negative bE$l-li@- (via Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) and Rhotic
Assimilation (77)). In examples in later chapters, I frequently list the full form
of lexical items disguised in this way in parentheses after the free translation.
     There being no voiced bilabial or labiodental fricative v, I use the symbol
“v” for any short vowel, “v˘” for any long vowel, and uppercase “V” as the
unmarked symbol for any vowel (long or short). The symbol for “syllable” is .","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47]"

                                    10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs   353     -tE@s-sa$- is from /-tE@rE$-sa$-/ via Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) and Rhotic
Assimilation (77). Using the same phonology, one would have expected Per-
fective Negative #-tE$l-li@- with geminated lateral, but instead we get -tE$-li@-.
     The one lexical idiosyncracy is that E@˘- ‘see’ has a high-frequency Exper-
iential Perfect E@t-tE@rE$- instead of #E@˘-te@rE$-.
     The Experiential Perfect is glossable ‘have (ever)’, or in connection with a
negation ‘have (never)’. Though most common with perception verbs E@˘- ‘see’
and a@ƒa@- ‘hear’, it can also be used with e.g. motion verbs (‘I have never gone
to Bamako’). The interlinear abbreviation is “ExpPf.” Examples are in (561).(561)   a. [du$N-ya$ra@ go@˘-ya$-Ø],          a@ƒa@-tE@s-sa$-y

chains (564.a). Rarely, -jE$ is followed by me$y< as part of a chain (564.b); this
combination, with L-toned -jE$, is audibly distinct from the much more common

(doing)’ that is used with a preceding chained verb with a sense not far from
recent perfect. This makes me suspect that Jamsay Recent Perfect -jE$- might not
be directly equatable to the ‘say’ quasi-verb -jE$- (§11.3.2) and its relatives.","[374, 375, 376, 377]"
"     The all-L tone pattern and the lack of overt AN suffixation can, in this light,
be considered to be iconic.
     The expanded use of the unsuffixed Perfective, albeit with a different tone
pattern, in relative clauses might be interpreted as reflecting an overall reduction
in focal salience of the verb and other constituents in relative clauses.
     There are analogues to the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective with predicative
adjectives and with negative verbs. When a predicative adjective is defocalized,
it not only drops its tones, but also omits the otherwise usual cliticized ‘be’
quasi-verb (§11.4.2). With negative verbs, the regular form (not defocalized)
has L-toned verb stem plus H-toned suffix (Perfective Negative -li@-, Imper-
fective Negative -go@-). Therefore the only audible cue to defocalization is that
the tone on the suffix drops to L-tone, as seen in (748) in §13.1.2 and (751) in
§13.1.3. There is no overt defocalization for positive imperfective verbs.",[369]
