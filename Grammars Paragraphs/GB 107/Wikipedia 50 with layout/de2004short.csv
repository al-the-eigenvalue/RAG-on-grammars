3. 4. 5 Negation   Negative imperative forms with the negative imperative adverb egcibara have already
been given, see ( 3 . 5 5-3 .56). The other negative verb forms found thus far have a negative6    See Appendix 2, Texts, Part A for this Tnanwatan genre.
7    Generally, when the negative suffix -aigo follows a vowel, the transitional sound [j] (grapheme: y) or
     sometimes [d] is inserted at the morpheme break. After the future suffix -sa, elision of /a/ takes place
     (-sa+-lligo>-.I'aigo).
40      Chapter 3suffix -aigo . Optionally, negative verb forms are preceded by the negative adverb nawo.
Examples:
(3.60)         (Nawo) n e-se-s-aigo.
               (not)    I SG.s-walk-FUT-NEG
               I am not going to walk.
  Occasionally, negation with -aigo leads to neutral ization of tense, gender, person and
number distinctions, for example:
(3 .6 1 )      Ma-ge-re-re             neqo-y-aigo      me-roe         {[go + uwo
               thus-do-PAST-and catch-TR-NEG 3.S-g0.ouLPAST.M so             road
               tira-i +   Usuqo gobo        ewaiwa + uwa-rero. #
               take-ADV Usuq6 branch and                road-name
               They did not catch him and he went out via the Usuqo arm, that it's name.
   The words eise 'yes' and (qe)q[do 'no' can stand on their own 8 as complete utterances in
conversations but (qe)qfdo is also used as an interclausal conjunction in disjunctive questions,
for example:
(3.62)         K6fido e-ri-sa            qeqfdo tero e-ri-sa ?
               coffee 2SG.S-drink-FUT or        tea 2SG.S-drink-FUT
               Do you want coffee or tea?
     I n contrastive contexts I have found the negative adverb ogara :
(3.63)         Ogara      ftigi (ago) naiti ne-waga-rita .
               not     he     (but) I        I SG.S-make-HAB
               Not he but I usually make it.","[52, 53]"

3.4. 7 Copular verbs
  I n locative-existential clauses I nanwatan uses a combination of the invariable element iÂ­
and demonstrative enclitics. Consider the following examples:
(3.69)      E-ra     me-qe-re        i-sai na-qfde-sai.
            3SG-to 3.s-speak-PAsT be-this.M my-father-this.M
            She said to him, my father is there.
(3.70)      J-wosu      Soru.
            be-those Sorong
            They are in Sorong.
(3.7 1 )    J-wasu mesida-o?
            be-these people-PL
            Are there people?
   With first and second person subjects, there is no predicative element:
42     Chapter 3(3.72)         Naiti    Soru.
               I       Sorong
               I am in Sorong.
     Locative-existential clauses may also be used to express possession:
(3.73)         Tugare,     pipiso     {-wai?
               Sir        money be-this.F
               Sir, do you have money?
   The copular verb -ra is used in clauses that express attribution (3 .74), equation (3.75) and
possession (3.78, 3 .79). The verb -ra is a special verb with irregular forms which express
only person, number and gender. The verb c1iticizes to predicative adjectives (3.74) and
nouns (3.75), as follows:
(3.74)        I SG.M             sowat-e-ra-ra 'I am good' (good-M- I SG-be)
              I SG.F             sowat-o-ra-ra
              2SG.M              sowal-i-a-ra
              2SG.F              sowal-u-a-ra9
              3SG.M              sowat-e-so
              3SG.F/3PL          sowal-o-wo
              I PL.EXC           sowal-o-ri-ra
              2PUI PLINC         sowal-o-i-ra
(3.75)(eJ.) Mesida -e bido me-wulau-bi            iosoi               nowi-so.
            person-M pig 3.s-kill-PRES.3SG.M that                     my.uncle-be.3SG.M
            The man who killed the pig is the headman
  The person a nd number suffixes of the first and second person correspond to the
possessive prefixes and the object prefixes. The verb form -eri-a igo 'not be' is used i n
negative attributive-equative clauses with -ra:
(3.76)(eJ.) Niiti   sowato-eri-aigo.
            we.EXC good-not.be-NEG
            We are not good.
   A rather special use of -eri-aigo is its function in verbs as a marker of temporal overlap of
events ('while A, B'). I nformants insist that -eriaigo means 'while' and not 'before' as might
be expected on the basis of the negative element in -eriaigo.
(3.77)         Usoqo gobo mai-wo             e      ma-ge-re-re            mo-owo-re

              one      thaLM      offspring-this.M so          Duweqau       father-this.M9     The liJ and lui in the 2SG forms are the result of the morphophonemic dissimilation rule which changes the
      half-close vowels leI and 101 into the close vowels liJ and lui before la/.
                                                                                Morphology     43            meqaro-wo-qede +         saa-wai        mi-atu-ri-y-aigo-sai-tigo

            Thus the Usoqo sea entered here and the water rose and one man with his
            children, the father of Duweqau, were still in the house and while the water
            rose, the man slaughtered his dogs.
  When used to express possession, the possessive marker -da is suffixed to the possessor
noun in predicate position:
(3. 78)(el.) Bido iowoi guru-i-da-wo.
             pig thaLF teacher-M-POss-be.3SG.F
             That pig is the teacher's (pig).
(3.79)      Meqaro Dinasi-da-wo.
            house Service-POSS-be.3SG.F
            The house is owned by the Service.","[54, 55, 56]"

    Research for this book was conducted in the framework of the Netherlands Organisation
for Scientific Research (NWO) program The I rian Jaya Studies: a programme for
interdisciplinary research (ISIR) headed by Wim Stokhof and as part of the Spinoza (NWO)
research program Lexicon and Syntax headed by Pieter M uysken. The I SI R programme was
carried out in cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia ). Inanwatan was
chosen within the I SI R research program to represent the languages of the southern Bird's
Head, linguistically terra incognita. I collected data in I nanwatan in the first three months of
 1 994 and during three months in 1 995.
    Thanks are due to Dr Hasan Alwi (Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa, Jakarta)
and to Dr A.O. Atururi (then Bupati of the Sorong regency) for their support and interest in my
research and to Mr Dominggus Murray of Inanwatan for teaching me the Inanwatan language
and for recruiting many excellent informants like Titus Mamary, Bernard Mitogai, Agustinus
Yawae, Set Eramuri and Set Setoge all of whom I thank for their patience and kindness. I
should thank Bert Voorhoeve for giving me his unpublished notes on the Inanwatan language
based on work with an I nanwatan informant in Bintuni, Irian Jaya, in 1 9 82, and the Summer
Institute of Linguistics, at Abepura, for sending me copies of the survey reports of Gravelle
(1986), Berry and Berry ( 1 987) and Kempf (n.d.). Dianne van Oosterhout, who worked as an
anthropologist in I nanwatan for the I SI R project deserves thanks for sharing insights and data
with me. The Benawa word list found in the Appendix 3 was taken by her. She also supplied me
with a number of local Malay texts of the Inanwatan area. M arian Klamer and Ger Reesink
took the trouble to read the whole manuscript critically, and this led to numerous improvements
in the analysis and presentation of the Inanwatan data. Thanks!

                               1                            Introduction
                              T nanwatan (or Bira, I Suabo) is a Papuan language spoken on the south coast of the Bird's
                          Head peninsula of Papua (Irian Jaya), Indonesia (see Maps). Voorhoeve (197 5:440) and the
                          survey reports of Gravelle ( 1 986), Berry and Berry ( 1 987) and Kempf (n.d.) contain some
                          rudimentary information about the language.2 See van Oosterhout (2002) for an
                          ethnography of the l nanwatan community.
                              The I nanwatan language is spoken in three places. First, in the village I nanwatan on the
                          south coast of the Bird's Head peninsula, where the Siganoi waters into the M acCluer Gulf.
                          I nanwatan is the main village of the l nanwatan district (Kecamatan lnan watan). Second, at
                          the southern entrance of Sele Strait which separates Salawati island from the Bird's Head
                          peninsula. And finally in the lalan Ferry area of Sorong, the capital of the Sorong regency.
                          These three communities maintain intensive contacts and I have not been able to detect
                          dialectal differences when I visited those communities. The Sele Strait and Sorong
                          communities consist of migrants from the village I nanwatan.
                              The I nanwatan language is dying out in a process of generational erosion. Generally
                          speaking, only people older than around fifty speak and understand it well . For these older
                          people, I nanwatan still is a major means of daily communication that they use alongside local
                          Malay. Children of elementary school age as a rule do not know the I nanwatan language;
                          they speak the local variety of Malay. Whereas the I nanwatan people as an ethnic group
                          number about 3000, I estimate the number of people fluently speaking I nanwatan to be no
                          higher than 800. The great majority of these 800 is also fluent in M alay. Since M a lay
                          functions both within the community and for external communication, M alay is the most
                          important means of communication for the I nanwatan community. Very extensive borrowing
                          from Malay and code mixing between Malay and lnanwatan occurs (see Appendix 2, Texts
                          Part B, no. 2 and 3).
                              According to Voorhoeve ( 1 975) the Inanwatan language belongs to the I nanwatan family,
                          one of the sixty-odd families of Papuan languages. The I nanwatan family has two member
                          languages, Inanwatan and Duriankari (also called Duriankere). It is very doubtful whether
                          Duriankari, reported by Voorhoeve ( 1 97 5 :440) as spoken on the island of Duriankari at the
                          southern entrance of Sele Strait, still exists. In one of the flood myths of the I nanwatan, the
                                       According to van Oosterhout (2002:1 75) some of her Inanwatan informants said they were the Bira
                                       people but she notes that the name Bira was also used for people living along the coast between Bintuni
                                       and Teminabuan. Suabo might be the name of an I nanwatan clan (gob6) or subclan ifaawu) although the
                                       name does not occur on the list of gob6 of van Oosterhout (2002: 1 73).
                           2           This chapter is partly based on de Vries ( 1 996, 1 998).","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

3. 4. 4 Mood3. 4. 4. 1 Imperative and adhortative mood
    The suffix -ra marks imperative; in plural imperative forms, a plural suffix -e is added:
(3 . 5 3)        Se-ra-re +     qegedi orewo + kaawe-ra. #
                 gO-IMP.SG-and sun     woman marry-IMP.SG
                 Go and marry the daughter of the sun.
                                                                                       Morphology         39(3. 54)       Ago me-qaqo-i-de                     me-era -rita-i +
              but    3S-face-PAST.SG.M-and         3s-say-DUR-PAST.SG.M
              qotoq6waro ow6i [qo-ra-e               na-wao-go. #

              And he faced (them) and said, that girl, you must give her to me as my wife.
  For the negative imperative, Future forms with -sa are used in combination with the
negative imperative adverb egcibara . Examples:
(3 . 5 5)     Egcibara nciwe       e-see-sa . #
              NEG.IMP me.O         2SG.S-cut-FUT
              Don't cut me.
(3. 56)       Egcibara ciibo ge-ra-sa. #
              NEG.IMP   voice 2PL.S-say-FUT
              You must not speak !
    The suffix -bido marks the plural adhortative:
(3 . 5 7)     Iro      tugarido       ira-sero      qe-bido.
              gong inheritance gong-story speak-ADH. I PL
              The gong, let us tell the tugarido6 story of the gong.","[51, 52]"
"
1.5.2 Nouns
   I n nouns, number and gender are distinguished. Apart from a class of mostly animate
nouns in which gender has a semantic basis (see examples ( 1 ), (2), (5), (6) , the Kokoda
gender system seems to be a phonological one, with nouns in lei or Iii masculine and nouns
ending in lal, 101 and lui feminine.
(5)     da(3ora    nige-ja
        dog.M    good-M
        a good (male) dog
(6)     da(3oro nige-jomo
        dog.F good-F
        a good (female) dog
(7)     udi       nige-ja
        banana good-M
        a good banana
(8)     keni      nige-ja
        house good-M
        a good house
  Just as in I nanwatan, masculine nouns seem to take the feminine form in the plural and
fem inine nouns remain unchanged in the plural:
                              Survey data of the languages of the lnanwatan district    1 35(9)        kenija             house

( 1 2)     kok6ko              hen
( 1 3)     kok6ko             chickens
 1.5.3 Personal pronouns      Gender, grammatical function and number are distinguished in personal pronouns:
( 1 4)     I SO subject        neiya
           I SO object         mime
           2S0                 aiya
           3S0.M               nigera
           3S0.F               n ig6mo
           I PL subject        n igara/niyi
           I PL object        ]lame
           2PL                 iya
           3PL                 nigaumo
There are the following possessive pronominal forms in the data:
( 1 5)     neri-kenija
           my-house
           tidi-kenija
           your(sO)-house
           nige-kenija
           his-house
           nigo-kenija
           her-house
1.5. 4 Verbs
  The verbs in the survey consist of a stem followed by a tense/mood slot and a person!
number slot. Sometimes it is possible to distinguish separate person and number slots. The
Future paradigm distinguishes gender in the third person singular forms.
( 1 6)     Ojare          udi-ja          ni-da-{3a.
           yesterday banana-M eat-PAST- I SO
           Yesterday I ate a banana.
( 1 7)     Tabtikomo       pie-ra-{3a .
           tobacco      smoke-PAST- I SO
           I smoked tobacco.
1 36     Appendix 3  The Past suffix -da in ( 1 6) occurs after verb stems ending in Iii, elsewhere (as in ( 1 7) the
Past suffix is -ra . (Compare I nanwatan Past suffix -re with its allomorph -de after i-stems.)
Past paradigm with notua- 'to go', in which -i seems to mark plurality:
( 1 8)    SG       I      notua-ra-ba
                   2      notua-ra-be
                   3      notua-ja
          PL       I      notua-ra-ban-i
                   2      notua-ra-be-i
                   3      notua-ra-ja-i
Past paradigm with a verb stem ending in Iii, ni- 'to eat' :
( 1 9)    SG              ni-da-/3a
                   2      ni-da-/3e
                   3      ni-na
          PL       l EX    ni-da-/3an-i

                   3       ni-na-i
   The Future marker is -/3a. There seems to be a masculine/feminine distinction in the third
person singular forms and an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person plural Future
forms. The Future paradigm of notua- 'to go':
(20)      SG I            notua-/3a-ena    '} shal l goll want to go'

         her    house

         ididi-ko?if3i     your (PL) heads
         nidao-ko?i(3i     their heads
2.5.2 Gender
  As in I nanwatan and Kokoda, gender pervades the grammar of Puragi affecting nouns,
demonstratives, adjectives and verbs and the system works along the same lines. Again, front
vowels are associated with masculine and non-front vowels with feminine gender:
(29)     Eino   go?a/dau?a nasi-omo.
         house this.F/that.F good-F
         This/that house is good.
(30)     Rabfni dcii?a     nasi-to.
         man    that.M good-M
         That man is good.
(3 1 )   Rawo    dciu?a    nasi-omo.
         woman that.F good-F
         That woman is attractive.
(32)     Mo-(3a-mai.
         come-FUT-3SG.M
         He will come.
(33)     Mo-(3a-mao.
         come-FUT-3SG.F
         She will come.
Whereas in Kokoda and I nanwatan gender has a semantic basis in animate nouns only (male
versus female referents), in Puragi (as in Tehit, Flassy 1 99 1 ) the vowel opposition front
versus non-front is used in animate nouns to distinguish male from female referents (30/3 1 )
and in (at least some) inanimate nouns to distinguish small from big referents, (34/35):
1 42    Appendix 3(34 )    amepuri               wind
         amepuro               strong wind
(35)     beqani                stone
         beqano                big stone
   Nouns distinguish number, with the plural expressed by lui replacing the stem final vowel
of the singular. A number of nouns have irregular plurals:
(36)     eino                  house
         einu muro             many houses
(37)     raga                  male dog
         rago                  female dog
         roroga                dogs
(38)     rah[ni moq6nada       one man
         rawo moqanado         one woman
         rabin u arwe          many people
2.5.3 Verbs    Puragi verbs consist of a verb stem followed by a tense or mood marker and a personl
number(/gender) slot. The Past marker is -ra with - da after i-stems (cf. Kokoda and
I nanwatan cognate Past markers with their a llophones). Gender (M/F) is expressed in 3 SG
forms. The person-number markers of Past and Present are the same.

         3PL         Ili-da-numo
    The Present forms are also used for events occurring before utterance time on the same
day (compare I nanwatan Present forms). The Present is marked by -a. The paradigm of ni-
'to eat' :
(40)     I SG        ni-'?a-no
         2SG         ni-'la-dero
         3SG.M       ni-'la-nedo

         2PL         ni-'?a-duro
         3PL         ni-'?a-numo
Future tense is marked by -(Ja (-ra with first person forms). The paradigm of mo- 'to come' :

         3PL             mo-/3o-ma -o-mo
The imperative corresponds to the 2SG future form:

         ka(3a-(3e       pound !
         ma-/3e          come !
The negative adverb a(3era precedes the imperative form in negative contexts:
(43)     A(3era      nido-/3e.
         do.not eat-IMP
         Don't eat !","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156]"

1.4 Adaptation in borrowing and in code mixing   Adaptation of Malay forms may take place in the context of borrowing, when Malay
elements become part of the I nanwatan language in a diachronic process on the level of the
language system, or in the context of interference, a synchronic process on the level of
8     Chapter 1language use, when bilingual Inanwatan people speak Malay with Inanwatan patterns
influencing the form of M alay elements. Because of the grand scale code mix ing and
borrowing the boundaries between Malay and I nanwatan are often unclear in the texts that
form the basis for the description of I nanwatan.
    When adaptation occurs in borrowing, the adaptation is a imed at fully and smoothly
integrating the Malay element into the I nanwatan language and the adapted form conforms
to the rules of the I nanwatan language. For example sfkorao-wai in ( 1 . 1 ) is good I nanwatan.
W hen adaptation occurs in the context of interference, the adapted forms remain part of
M alay and may be perceived as violating the patterns of (regional) Malay. For example,
duaberas in ( 1 .3) is 'bad' Malay and followed by a repair.
    When Malay is the only language used in a communicative situation, for example in
church or when talking to non-Inanwatan people, adaptation is much more marked and much
less accepted than when Malay forms are adapted in code mixing, when speakers such as
Yunus in ( 1 .2) use both Malay and I nanwatan to construct their messages to other Inanwatan
bilinguals such as M urray in ( 1 .2).
    The negative attitudes of the community towards adaptation of Malay forms in MalayÂ­
only genres prevent most types of interferential adaptation in these situations. The adaptation
that I noticed is at h igher levels of grammar: the prosodic level a nd the levels
of discourse and surface syntax. For example, certain discursive strategies such as tail-head
linkage (see Â§4. 3 . 1 ) are used also in local Malay and the typical fall (tail)-rise plus slowing
down/pause phenomena (head) intonation contour of I nanwatan tail-head l inkage is clearly
audible in the M alay tail-head linkages. Lower level adaptations (phonotactic, morphological
and phonemic adaptations of the type kapa/>kQparo) hardly occur or are followed by repairs
in Malay-only genres.
   M uysken (2000:3) distinguishes three types of code mixing: 'insertion of material from
one language into a structure from the other language, alternation between structures from
languages and congruent lexicalization of material from different lexical inventories into a
shared grammatical structure'. I n alternating I nanwatan-Malay code m i xing, levels of
interferential adaptation are comparable to the very low levels in Malay-only contexts.
Compare the Malay stretches in examples (l.2b) and ( l .2d) above such as hanya karena bu
dia sendiri disana m ungkin kekurangan kekurangan .
   Although Malay words may be inserted without any adaptation, in insertional code mixing
levels of adaptation are much higher than in alternating code mixing and adaptation occurs
on phonemic, phonotactic and prosodic levels. Therefore the distinction between insertional
code m ixes and borrowings is often difficult to make on the basis of adaptation criteria.
Consider:
( 1 .5)   Mdiwa +     laboratorium keredidau re-ge-re              ewaiwa +     t[go
          and         laboratory       work       I SG.s-do-PAST and            so
          m6-qe     pensio         re-ge-re +   6rmati-go     me-rego-re +

          year-CTRC-this.F 1 984
          Next I worked in the lab until I retired with honour in 1 984.
The foreign word laboralOrium is inserted without adaptation, it is not part of the Inanwatan
vocabulary and clearly a case of insertional code mix ing. But ormati, an adaptation from
                                                                                                 Introduction   9Malay hormat inserted in the slot NP-go could be both a Malay insertional code mix showing
interferential adaptation or a borrowed word with resulting adaptation.
   One of the most frequently used mixing strategies employs the verb ge- 'to do'. When this
occurs, the Malay material preceding the verb ge- may remain completely unadapted Or
exhibit considerable adaptation. Consider the following examples:
( 1 .6) a.   Maiwa keredidau re-ge-re               +        tau-go         tujuhpulu-go +

             And I worked and in 1 970 they appointed me head of the village until in
             1 972 I received a call again and I stepped down from the office of village
             head in order to go to school again and to be an intern in the laboratory of
             the General Hospital in Sorong.
   I n example ( 1 .6) the verb ge- 'to do' occurs five times. It occurs with the adapted nouns
keredidau 'work ' in ( 1 .6a), sikorao 'school' in ( 1 .6f) and prakteki 'practice' in ( 1 .6g), with
the unadapted Malay alternating code mix kepala Kampong e Desa berhenti dulu in ( 1 .6e)
and with the Malay loan verb angka- 'to appoint' in (l.6b). The verb ge- can be used as an
alternation device, for example kepala Kampong e Desa berhenti dulu d-ge-re in ( 1 . 6e) and
as an insertion device, for example prakteki re-ge-re in ( 1 .6g). When used as an insertion
device, ge- forms complex phrasal verbs with the preceding Malay words (see Â§4.2.1). Again
the boundary between insertional code m ixing with ge- and borrowing is very hard to draw.
    Malay words may be borrowed without adaptation. For example the loan conjunctions
terus, jadi, baru, suda(h), a tau, tapi, dan have various discourse connective functions in
Inanwatan and are never adapted. But most borrowed elements from open lexical classes
undergo adaptations.
   l nanwatan speakers call the process of code mixing Lompat, a Malay verb meaning 'to
jump' and they usually have no problems separating 'speaking Tnanwatan ' from 'speaking
M alay '. For example when asked about utterances as in (1.2d) they will say that Yunus
4    -de is an allomorph of the Past suffix -re occurring after stem-final Iii (see Â§3.4.2.1).
10    Chapter 1speaks Malay when he says iy6 rencana begitu tapi and Inanwatan when he says fl(lrido
keredidao e-wai.
    Summarizing, adaptation phenomena occur both in borrowing and in interference and
Malay words can be borrowed without adaptation, so adaptation cannot be easily applied as a
criterion to separate Malay elements in code mixes (speaking Malay) from Malay borrowings
(speaking Inanwatan). Adaptation is strongly disfavoured in Malay-only contexts,
disfavoured in Malay/l nanwatan alternating code mix ing and quite accepted in insertional
code mixing. Only certain types of adaptation 'survive' in Malay-only genres and in
alternating code mixing (mostly prosodic and discursive adaptation). In borrowing the
tendency is the opposite: adaptation is favoured and expected, and occurs at all levels.
Because of pairs like sikoraolsekolah 'school ', uiugoltahun 'year', kaparolkapal 'ship', ikoÂ­
likut 'to follow', phonotactic, morphological and semantic adaptation became associated for
I nanwatan speakers with 'speaking Inanwatan'. And absence of adaptation (or mild presence
of prosodic and discursive adaptation) is associated with 'speaking Malay'. Such structural
criteria are combined by native speakers with genre criteria to decide whether someone is
speaking Malay or I nanwatan. For example, adapted forms of Malay occurring through
interference during a government meeting (such as niwapuru 'fifty' instead of limapulu) will
be seen as (bad) Malay because that is a Malay-only setting. The same adapted forms when
occurring in a lLigarido story, an l nanwatan genre of texts, will be seen as good I nanwatan
(for example adapted borrowed numerals).","[20, 21, 22, 23]"

3. 1 1 Question clitics and question words
   Polar questions are marked by rising intonation a nd the optional sentence-final polar
question c 1itic -qe (sometimes -e), (3. 1 09}-(3. 78).

3 The Yahadian language
    Yahadian, of the Konda-Yahadian family, spoken in the villages M ugim, Yahadian and
(parts of) Kais, is the western neighbour of the Inanwatan language. Konda, spoken in the
villages Konda and Sisir in the Teminabuan subdistrict, and Yahadian seem to be dialects of
the Konda-Yahadian language. Speakers of the Mugim-Yahadian variety claimed that they
clould easily understand Konda speakers. They claimed also that they could not understand
Tehit, and that they hardly understood Puragi and the language of Makororo, a village on the
Kais river where a dialect of May Brat is spoken (Dol 1 999).
   The village of M ugim, situated on the Metamani river close to its mouth, has around 750
inhabitants and Yahadian, on the Kais river, around 400. I visited M ugim on 26 and 27
September 1 995. Many informants helped me there. Two main informants were Yunus
Mebuto (born in Mugim, 1 926) and Doroteis Reriite (born in Mugim, 1 9 2 3 ), both with
elementary and junior high school education.
   The data on the variety spoken in the village Yahadian I obtained in I nanwatan in October
1 995 from the mantri Nataniel Regoi, born in 1 944 in Yahadian and with elementary school
plus junior high school education. All data given here are from M ugim. According to the

3.5.3 Verbs
   The verbs i n the elicited data consist of a verb stem (sometimes with suppletive plural
stems), followed by a tense/mood suffix. In sentences elicited with apeme 'yesterday ' these
forms occur:
(55)      man- (PL stem ray-) 'to go' (data from the dialect spoken in the village Yahadian)
          Me apeme                man-e.
          I      yesterday go-PAST
          E            apeme          man-e.
          you(SG) yesterday go-PAST
          Wo          apeme          man-e.

1.3 Types of adaptation occurring in Malay elements(a) Phonemic and allophonic adaptation:
    lnanwatan has nasal phonemes with oral allophones. The Inanwatan phoneme Inl has
three allophones [n], [rl and [rl. The allophone [nl occurs word-initially and lr/r] wordÂ­
medially. The flapped vibrant [rl freely varies with (rl, the rolled vibrant, the latter being the
most frequent realization. Examples: ['ncr:>1 'name', ['a-rEr:>] 'your name', f'nira] 'day' ['niraÂ­
rira] 'each day'. The Inanwatan phoneme Iml has three allophones [ml, [w] and (P]. The
allophone [m] occurs word-initially, [w] medially adjacent to back vowels (i.e. followed
and/or preceded by [0], [u] or [:>]) and [p] elsewhere. Examples: ['muwur::>] 'rivers'; ['napE]
 'me (object)'.
    Now in foreign words, word-medial [mJ may be pronounced as lw] or [PJ and the initial
[w] of source forms as [m]. Examples: Dutch e m m er 'bucket' is adapted to ('EPEf::>].
Indonesian wakil 'deputy' is adapted to ['makiriJ 'deputy headman (raja)', Indonesian kaca
m a ta 'glasses' is adapted to ['kaowato]; Indonesian limap u luh 'fifty' to Inanwatan
['nipapuru]. Dutch commissie, a term used for the Patipi headmen appointed by the Dutch
administration to rule Inanwatan, is adapted to ['bwisi]. Medial [n] is adapted to [r/r] in
foreign words. For example, the Patipi word inanwatan is adapted both to the word structure
prohibiting final C and CC clusters (>/iminowatanol, by vowel insertions) and to the
allophonic patterns of the Inanwatan language ([i'rar:>watar::>]. Malay II/ is replaced by
Inanwatan Inl with its oral allophones [ric], for example Malay wakil 'deputy' is adapted to
['makiri] 'deputy headman'.(b) Phonotactic adaptation
  Inanwatan phonotaxis does not allow CC clusters and final C. Vowel insertion and
consonant deletion are employed to adapt foreign words to Inanwatan phonotactics, for
example p6toroti 'pencil' is the adapted form of Dutch po/lood).(c) A daptation in word stress and intonation contours
   Inanwatan has unpredictable, lexical word stress. Quite often the word stress of foreign
words changes in borrowed words, e.g. regional Malay pandita>Inanwatan paditae '(male)
minister'. When two Malay utterances are linked by recapitulative strategies reflecting
'Papuan ' tail-head linkages, the intonation contour is adapted towards the typical
fall-rise-pause pattern associated with 'Papuan' tail-head linkage. See Â§4.3. 1 for Inanwatan
recapitulative linkage strategies.(d) Semantic adaptation
  Meanings of foreign words may change, for example Malay kapa/ means 'non-native
boat' in both its adapted form (kaparo) and non-adapted form. Because of the gender system
                                                                            Introduction      7of I nanwatan, gender-neutral foreign nouns referring to animate entities develop genderÂ­
specific meanings e.g. Malay pandfta 'minister' > Inanwatan paditae 'male minister'.(e) Morphological adaptation
     Morphological adaptation can be illustrated with the integration of nouns and verbs in
 the I nanwatan morphology.
    Gender in I nanwatan nouns is marked by the last vowel, with nouns ending in a front
 vowel (Ii!, lei) being masculine and the remaining nouns (ending in 101, lui and la/) feminine.
 In a minority of nouns, gender has a semantic basis (male and female). Now borrowed nouns
 denoting humans have lei or Iii added when they denote males and 101 when they denote
 females, for example Malay guru 'teacher', has the I nanwatan forms gurui '(male) teacher',
guruo '(female) teacher'. I nanimate borrowed nouns are assigned a gender on the basis of
 their final vowel, if they end in a vowel. When they end in a consonant, they are assigned a
 gender by the addition of 101 or Ie, i!. Examples: ewero 'bucket' Â« Dutch emmer), kompasi
 'compass' Â« Dutch kompas), kaparo 'ship' Â« Malay kapaL), potoroti 'penci l ' Â« Dutch
potlood), pensili Â« Malay pensil 'pencil'), listriki 'electricity' Â« M alay listrik), tabQqido
 'tobacco' Â« Dutch tabak). The addition of vowels is done arbitrarily, that is, I have not (yet)
been able to find a semantic or phonetic base for the gender-integration of such non-human
nouns.
    I nanwatan has a complex verb morphology. Verbs are inflected for subject person and
number, object person and number, tense, mood, aspect, negation and gender. Subject and
object are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes, with the exception of counterfactual and third
person future forms which have subject suffixes. To integrate foreign verbs into this system,
Malay verbs (like buka 'to open') are productively combined with the verb ge- 'to do' in
complex phrasal verbs (see Â§4.2. 1 ). Phonologically, the Malay verb and the verb ge- with its
prefixes and suffixes are integrated under one stress contour and the first 1m! of the subject
prefix Ime-I is always realised by the intervocalic allophone [ w ] . Thus buka-we-ge-re
(open-3.s-take-PAST) instead of buka me-ge-re. Another way to integrate Malay verbs found
in the text is to adapt a Malay stem phonologically and then attach affixes to it as in
me-susa-re 'they lamented, wailed' (from regional Malay bersusa 'to lament, to wail ').
    These phonological and morphological adaptation processes have drastic effects on the
form of Malay items. In the speech of bilingual members of the I nanwatan community one
can find hundreds of pairs of words with a Malay item alongside its adapted l nanwatan
counterpart. Examples: sfkoraolsekolah 'school', ttiu-goltahun 'year' (in which -go is the
I nanwatan circumstantial postposition), keredidaolkerja 'work ', kapa rolkapal 'ship', fkoÂ­
likul 'to follow someone'. Many of these adapted forms have been around for a long time in
the community and have a stable, conventional form. Although adaptation occurs very
frequently not every Malay element occurs in two forms (adapted and non-adapted). Some
words, like sementara 'temporary' in (1.1), always seem to have the same non-adapted form,
even when they are integrated within I nanwatan morphology.","[19, 20]"
"
3.3. 4 Compounds
  I n noun compounds a modifying noun stem precedes a modified noun stem. When the
modifying noun stem is a feminine noun ending in 10/, the final vowel becomes lal in the
compound noun. The stress of the modified noun becomes the main stress of the compound.
The stress of the modifying noun becomes a secondary stress. Examples:
(3.4 1 )     fro    gong            sero    word         ira-sero         a story about a gong
             muro   river           m iloro side         mura- wetoro     riverside
             bfdo   pig             erasoe fat           bida-erasoe      pigfat
             qegedi sun             orewo   woman        qegedi-orewo     daughter of the sun
3.4 Verbs
   There are four classes of verbs, intransitive, transitive, ditransitive and copular verbs (-ra
and i-). Copular verbs have either their own, limited inflection (-ra) or no inflection (i-). The
other verb classes share inflection for person, number and gender of the subject, tense, aspect
and negation. Transitive and ditransitive verbs may mark the object in the verb, but only
when the object is the speaker or the addressee. Subject and object are crossreferenced or
expressed by verbal prefixes, with the exception of counterfactual and third person future
forms which have subject suffixes. A sizeable minority of verbs have suppletive plura l
stems, for example uwu- 'to sit', with plural stem te-, se- 'to go'with plural stem reqa-, miwiÂ­
'to run' with plural stem noda-, qebadi- 'to turn (fNTR) with plural stem qebate-, na- 'to cry'
with plural stem neberu- and nou- 'to fall' with plural stem nouquge-.",[48]

4.2. 4 Relative and adverbial clauses
   Clauses marked by the topic marker/subordinator -qe(de) (see Â§3.9) may be interpreted
either as a relative clause (4.4 1 ) or an adverbial clause (4.42). Clauses that modify nouns
(relative clauses) always follow the head noun and do not have pronouns coreferential with
the head noun.

           'you must try and eat it'.
                                                                                         Syntax   59 (4.42)    Paralo me-gerae-rila-qede            ne-se-sa .

   Clauses may function as relative clauses without any overt marking. Compare nfili
nige-rago-be in (4.43):(4.43)     lyo    mfroqai-webe         tigo-wo +      aruqo    qai-nige-rowo-be +

           Yes, that is true, we followed the bloodtrail and it lay dead which we speared,
           which I speared at night at the sagobait.
I n (4 .44) -qe functions as a topic marker that cliticizes to the head of the relative clause:
(4.44)     Jadi      bido-qe          iwaa-go           me-rago-re    +   m e-lele-re
           therefore pig-TOP         yesterday-eIRe     3.s-pierce-PAST 3.S-cut-PAST

           Therefore the pig which they had speared and slaughtered the day before,
           they did not carry it away.
   In the context of Papuan languages it not unexpected to have adverbial and relative
clauses expressed by the same form (e.g. Korowai, van Enk & de Vries 1 997: 1 1 4-1 1 5), and
also to have the same marker with topical noun phrases and adverbial/relative subordinate
clauses (e.g. Usan, Reesink. 1 987, Kombai, de Vries 1 993).","[71, 72]"

1.1 Research framework and data collection    Data for this book were collected in the framework of the Netherlands Organization for
Scientific Research program The I rian Jaya Studies: a program me for i nterdisciplinary
research (ISIR) and further analyzed as part of the Spinoza (NWO) research program
Lexicon and Syntax.
    I nanwatan was chosen within the ISIR research program to represent the languages of the
southern Bird's Head. This whole area is linguistically unknown and a data oriented study of
at least one language was seen to be important for a general picture of Papuan languages.
I ndeed l nanwatan and other south Bird's Head languages that I surveyed turned out to be
typologically distinct in i nteresting ways from both the languages of the Bird's Head and
Trans New Guinea languages (see Â§ I .6 and Â§ I .7).
    The relevance of the Inanwalan data for the Spinoza program of Pieter M uysken that
focuses on language contact, resides in the fact that most I nanwatan speakers constantly rely
on two languages, M alay and I nanwatan, to construct their messages. I ntense bilingualism i n
situations o f generational erosion creates specific field linguistic problems, i n the collection,
transcription and analysis of the data (see Â§ 1 .2).
    I recorded and transcribed word l ists and oral texts in I nanwatan in the first three months
of 1 994 and during three months in 1 995. Since I had only six months of exposure to the
language, I do not pretend to present more than a preliminary survey of some major patterns
of the language as they could be observed in the word lists and texts that I collected.
    There is a c lear age and gender bias in the I nanwatan data since the majority of my
informants were older, male speakers. Male informants were easier to get and easier to work
with for cultural reasons. The age bias follows from the fact that only older people are fluent
speakers of the I nanwatan language and still use it as their first language in daily life. The
Inanwatan community was very supportive of my research and many people volunteered to
tell stories, take me along on trips and to their houses knowing that I was recording all that
was said during those visits and trips.
    Although the description is mostly based on natural speech that I recorded and transcribed,
I also made use of data elicited in Malay. These data are marked by (el.) after the reference
number. I used direct elicitation only where I judged the chance for i nterference from the
Malay stimuli to be relatively small but still there is no doubt a Malay bias in these elicited
data.
4   Chapter J1.2 Transcribing and analyzing speech in bilingual communities    Linguists collecting a nd transcribing vernacular speech in bilingual communities of
I ndonesia will increasingly observe Malay elements in their transcribed texts. This creates
special difficulties for the field linguist, for example how to separate Malayicized vernacu lar
from M alay in the transcriptions. Consider the following examples from three texts recorded
in I nanwatan. Bold is used in this book for all M alay elements in the data, irrespective of
their status as borrowed elements or code mixes.

     There are two types of Malay forms in such transcriptions of bilingual speech as in
 (I. I }--( 1 .4), forms that conform to the patterns of regional Malay spoken i n the Bird's Head
 such as sementara and Desember. And forms that violate those patterns such as duaberas in
 (1.3) and sikorao-wai in ( 1 . 1 ). I n ( 1 .4) the Malay word lima 'five' occurs i n adapted (niwa)
and non-adapted form (lim a ) within one utterance. Since the deviations from the regional
Malay standards follow from adaptations of these forms in the direction of the vernacular
 language, in this case I nanwatan, I will cal1 forms such as duaberas, niwapuru, sikorao-wai
adapted forms and forms l ike duabelas, limapulu, sekola non-adapted forms. Of course,
regional Malay varieties are oral, non-standardized varieties with a lot of variation, not only
horizontal1y, from place to place, but also vertical ly because regional Malay i s a sociolect
continuum with basolects, mesolects and acrolects. I t is normal for texts in local Malay to
mix elements from basolects, mesolects and acrolects. So, the norms are rather flexible.
Nevertheless, forms l ike dua beras, niwapuru, sikorao-wa i are recognized by I nanwatan
speakers as 'bad' Malay when these forms occur in Malay-only genres such as sermons in
church.
     'Pure' regional M alay (without code m ixing and without I nanwatan loans) is used i n
church, school and government contexts and as an interethnic lingua franca (see Appendix 2
Texts, Part C for a text in this local M alay). Relatively 'pure' I nanwatan (without code
mixing, but with some Malay loans) is used in certain genres of the oral tradition like the
tugarido genre (clan (gob6) owned heirloom stories, see for example Appendix 2, Texts, Part
A, texts 1 and 2). Continuous, intensive M a lay/lnanwatan mixing is used within the
community as the default means of communication, exemplified by texts 2 and 3 of Part B,
Appendix 2, Texts).
    It is to be expected that the I nanwatan morphosyntax is not immune from influence from
the morphosyntax of Malay but since we do not have k nowledge of older stages in the
development of I nanwatan, such influence is hard to assess. For example, nowadays SVO
constituent order occurs in frequent variation with SOY order in I nanwatan clauses but we do
not know what the clause order was before contact with Malay. But it is clear that not only
lexical words but also complete classes of grammatical words or function words have been
borrowed from Malay, for example discourse conjunctions (like baru and j adi see Â§4.3 .2)
                                                                                      ,and numerals (see Â§3.7 and Â§4.4.4). The inclusive-exclusive distinction in first person plural
6    Chapter Jpronouns and verbs (see Chapter 3 ) very likely derives from contact with Austronesian
languages like Malay and Sekar since only non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea
bordering on Austronesian languages or in close contact with them have the inclusiveÂ­
exclusive opposition.","[16, 17, 18, 19]"

               transitional sound [j ]: y2
      This graphemic decision is not based on phonemic considerations but on sociolinguistic ones: I nanwatan
      people, under the influence of the I ndonesian writing system, do not accept a purely phonemic spelling for
      Iml and In/.
2     See Chapter 3 for the transitional (j] and other morphophonemic processes.
3             Morphology
    The relatively complex verb morphology of lnanwatan, where verbs can have up to five
affixes, is in contrast with the rather simple verb morphologies of the languages of the other
parts of the Bird ' s Head like Abun (Berry & Berry 1 999), Moi ( Menick 1 996, 2000),
M aybrat (Dol 1 999) and Hatam (Reesink 1 999). Verbs are i nflected for subject person,
number and gender, object person and number, tense, mood, aspect and negation. Subject and
object are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes. l Gender is a pervasive feature of the
I nanwatan morphology, affecting all major wordclasses.","[39, 40]"
"
4.3.2 Discourse conjunctions
   Besides tail-head linkage and generic verb l inkage I nanwatan employs a c losed set of
discourse conjunctions consisting of the I nanwatan conjunctions ewaiwalma iwalmai 'and,
next', ago 'and, but', tigo 'so, thus' and the Malay loan conjunctions tapi 'but', atau 'or' suda
'next, allright, and so', baru 'and, next', jadi 'therefore; and so; so'and terus 'next; and'. The
Malay discourse conjunctions combine with each other and with the I nanwatan conjunctions,
for example in (4.49) terus is used together with ewaiwa.
   The conjunctions ewaiwalmaiwalmai 'and, next ', ago 'and, next' and baru 'and, next'are
sequencing conjunctions. I have not yet been able to determine their relationships, for
example in terms of the nature or force of the sequentiality they express. The conjunction
ago (sometimes ago) is exemplified by (4.5 1 ):
(4.5 1 )   Ago me-qaqo-i-de                me-era-rita-i +            qotoqowaro
           and    3s-face-PAST.SG.M-and    3s-say-oUR-PAST.SG.M daughter

           that.F put.down-IMP-PL my-wife-clRc
           And he faced (them) and said, that girl, you must give her to me as my wife.
62       Chapter 4   I n (4.52) bam is used medially to express sequence of events, and in (4.53) initially as a
sequential sentence-linker:

            a bridge and decorated it.
(4. 5 3 )   Baru + mfrago           sowato me-we-rita-i                    tawaro        sowato +

            And he gave good machetes, good axes for the ancestors to do things.
   The conjunctions t{go and jadi express consequence ('and so, and therefore') rather than
just neutral sequence. They may have reason and cause interpretations.
   Tfgo 'so, thus' is used in example (4.54):
(4.54)      Tfgo mage me-era-rita-re +                me-se-rila-i         ma-ge-re-re
            so     thus     3SG-say-DuR-PAST 3S-gO-DUR-PAST.M thus-do-PAST-and

            3s-say-PAST.M door         open-stand-IMP.SG
            Because she said so, he went and having thought 'oh, how long is she ill!',
            he said, 'open the door!'.
Jadi occurs in (4.5 5 ):
(4.55)      Ago-iri         ga       go-ura-rita          ewai   na-qide       jadi

          3S-come-PAST.PL-CONN 3S-see-PAST.PL 3S-run-PAST.PL fright-cIRC
          They fired but they did not hit and they (Namora's people) came and saw
          that they (=the I nanwatan killing party) had fled with fright.
   Example (4.57) shows the use of suda. I ts functions are hard to pin down. Often it is used
as a pause device/speaker continuation device that can be glossed as 'allright' or 'allright and
next . . . ' :
(4.57)    M e-roda-ri-y-aigo    suda +          a    me-rowo-i
          3S-run-not.be-TR -NEG allright        ah 3S-come.down-PAST.SG.M

          his relatives were in sorrow and seeing (their) father, they returned and
          performed magic.
Terus 'and, next' expresses speaker continuation ('1 am going on to tel l you the next thing'),
(4.49). Notice how terus is used in exactly the same way in the local M a lay text i n
Appendix, Part C.
  A tau expresses alternative conjunction:

          bride).
64       Chapter 44.4 Noun phrases
  Noun phrases are distinct from compound nouns (see Â§ 3 . 3 .4). I n noun compounds a
modifying noun stem precedes a modified noun stem under one stress contour. When the
modifying noun stem is a feminine noun ending in /0/ (the large majority of nouns), the final
vowel becomes /a/ in the compound noun, for example:
(4.59)      fro           gong
            sero          word
            ira-sero      story about a gong
    I n noun phrases the constituents are not brought under one stress contour, as in (4.60)
where the possessor noun orewo modifying the possessed (compound) head noun a ibasero
retains its lexical stress and the final /0/ of modifying feminine nouns does not change into
/a/:
(4.60)      ladi suda        orewo aga aiba-sero          iko-we-ge-i.
            so     allright woman POSS voice-word follow-3S-do-PAST.M
            So, allright, he followed the instructions of the woman.
Noun phrases seem to have the following general structure:
     +/- possessor N/PRO + N(-dem enclitic) +/- NUM +/- ADJ +/- DEM
A noun phrase combining a numeral and an adjective did not occur in the texts but only in the
data elicited through Malay (see below, numerals). I have no examples of noun phrases with
a numeral, plus an adjective plus a demonstrative nor of noun phrases with a possessor plus a
numeral and/or adjective. Gender plays an important role in the cohesion of the noun phrase.
The adjective, numeral and the demonstrative agree with the head noun in gender and number
(see Chapter 3 ).","[74, 75, 76, 77]"
"
       The data are written in phonemes represented by the graphemes given in the Grapheme Table (see Â§2.4).
       Notice that the orthographic decision to write the allophones of Iml and Irl (see Chapter 2) means that for
       example the third person subject prefix me- is written sometimes as we- and sometimes as me- depending
       on its pronunciation.
                                                        52

            be-these here-CONN-CIRC
            They are here.
When there is n o location expressed, the clause predicates the presence o r existence o f the
subject:
 (4.5)      J-wasu mesida-o ?
            be-these person-PL
            Are there people?
   Attributive-equative clauses (S P-ra) have non-verbal predicates expressing possession,
attribution and equation (see Â§3 .4.7 for examples). These clauses contain the copular verb
-ra, a special verb with irregular forms which express only person , number and gender (see
Â§3.4.7). The copular verb cliticizes to predicative adjectives and nouns. The predicate is the
only obligatory constituent in this clause type.
(4.6)       Bada-o-wo!
            bad-F-be.3SG.F
            It is bad !
    I ntransitive clauses ( S V ) have intransitive verbs a s their heads, for example the verbs
tara- 'to shine', rawo- 'to come up' and i- 'to descend' in example (4.2). The verb is the only
obligatory constituent in the intransitive clause, example (4. 1 )
   A special subtype of intransitive clauses is based on experiential verbs, intransitive verbs
that take a bodypart as their first argument and express emotional and physical experiences.
Because the bodypart argument is always subject, the verb is always a third person form. The
verb and the bodypart NP are both obligatory constituents in the experiential intransitive
clause:
(4.7)       Na-qer-e    me-tutu-rita-bi.
            my-ear-M 3.s-hurt-DUR-3SG.M
            I (male) have pain in my ear.
(4.8)       Qotoqowar-e mfr-i       me-sowate-bi.
            child-M        belly    3.S-good-3SG.M.PRES
            The boy is glad.
   When there is an experiencer NP, it precedes the bodypart subject, as in (4.8).
   Transitive clauses (SOY/SYO) have transitive verbs as their heads. The verb is the only
obligatory constituent in the transitive clause, (4.9).
(4.9)(el.) Ni-a-weigo-re.
            I SG.S-2SG.O-deceive-PAST

Objects frequently occur after the verb:

"
4.3. 1 Tail-head linkage and generic verb linkage
   Tail-head recapitulation 2 is frequently used in I nanwatan texts to link sentences, as a
continuity device, especially in narrative texts. The recapitulated 'head' clause is a coordinate
clause usually linked to the next clause with the proximate demonstrative ewaiwa (,here;
now'; see Â§3 .2Â» as in (4.48). Sentences (4.47)-(4.49) are from the opening section of the
Nawora text (see Appendix 2, Texts).
(4.47)      Na wora      aga sero tugarido + ne-qe-rita +        Na wora esai

2    The term tail-head linkage is from Thurman ( 1 975). It refers to a phenomenon which is 'extremely
     common in Papuan languages, especially in narrative texts. Such texts are littered with dozens of
     examples of this usage' (Foley 1 986:20 I ). Longacre ( 1 972:45) has described the phenomenon as follows:
     'Commonly the function of the first base in such chaining units is to refer back to the last base of the
     previous chain. If the chain structures as a paragraph, then such back-reference or recapitulation joins
     paragraph to paragraph.'
                                                                                    Syntax     61           mura-garebo jadi maiwo-qede           mtiso-we-ge-i. #

           And when he had come upriver, he settled on the island , they settled
           opposite the Solowat rivermouth.
The connection (4.48/49) shows that e waiwa is also used to connect sentences without
recapitulation .
   Instead of repeating the verb of the last clause of the previous sentences as the first verb
of the next sentences, the generic verb magerere may be used to link sentences as in (4.50).
Mage(rere) most likely derives from mai 'here, this.F', the verb ge- 'to do', the Past suffix -re
and the coordinator -re 'and'.

2    Chapter 1Duriankari speakers are regarded as I nanwatan people who in ancient times were carried off
 to the Sele Strait area by a flood (see Texts, Part A, no.4Â» . When I visited the I nanwatan
 speaking community of the village Seget, situated at the southern entrance to the Sele Strait,
 in M arch ] 994, the I nanwatan people there claimed that the Duriankari language was no
 longer used. Below we will discuss the possibility that Inanwatan is not an isolate but a
 member of the South Bird's Head family. The language, village and district name I nanwatan
 originates from a Patipi expression meaning 'sago only' or 'it is all sago' (ina n 'sago' and
 sewatan 'one'). The immense sago swamps of the I nanwatan area inspired Patipi colonists to
 call the area I nanwatan ('it is all sago'). Patipi is a village on the south coast of the Bomberai
 peninsula, in the Onin area. I nanwatan people use the name Patipi also for the Austronesian
 language of the Bomberai peninsula known as Sekar, a dialect of the Onin language, spoken
 today in Kokas by about 600 persons. Some I nanwatan people called their language the
Iriirowata ro language when talking to me,3 an adaptation of the word I nanwatan to the
 sound patterns of the l nanwatan language (see below) but n idiiibo 'our language (voice)' is
the normal way to refer to the language. The North-Moluccan Sultans of Tidore had their
 ' middle men' in the Onin area who established trade monopolies on the Bird's Head south
coast, especially where major rivers watered into the MacCluer Gulf and the Seram Sea.
These 'middle men ' had the M alay title raja 'king'. There were raja's in the villages
R umbati, Patipi, Ati-Ati and Fatagar and each raja had his own section of the Bird's Head
 south coast where he had some influence through representatives who settled near river
m ouths (see Vink 1932:4 1 ). The raja of Patipi sent representatives to the Siganoi river
 mouth where they engaged in slave trade with the Inanwatan people. To get slaves, the
I na nwatan raided the interior but also neigbouring coastal peoples like the Yahadian. I n
exchange for the slaves, they received cloths, iron tools and weapons and guns from the
Patipi 'middle men'. Although these raja 's of Patipi never established a regular government
 in the Inanwatan area, the Patipi colonists in I nanwatan married local women and Patipi
words were borrowed by the I nanwatan language. To confirm the Patipi origin of the name
I nanwatan and to investigate lexical links between I nanwatan and Patipi, an Austronesian
language, I visited the Patipi speaking village Kokas in October 1 99 5 . Examples of
I nanwatan words with Patipi origin: nati raja (king)' (>Patipi na ti), noto 'cloth; sarong'
                                                 '(>Patipi not), pasao 'rice' (>Patipi pasa), sosorao 'forked fishing spear' (>Patipi sosona).
    Between the 1 6th and the end of the 19th century, Patipi (Onin, Sekar) had become an
i mportant lingua franca in the M acCluer Gulf area. Old I nanwatan people told me that the
first protestant evangelists in I nanwatan (from ] 908 on) used a mixture of Patipi and M alay
in their sermons. The senior Dutch civil servant F.H . Dumas writes in his Memorie van
Overgave (Memorandum of Conveyance) in ] 9 ] 1: 'De op Bira geplaatste ambtenaar E.A.
Tanasale is [ ... ] de Papoeataal van Onin, die ook daar verstaan wordt machtig. ' (The c ivil
servant E.A. Tanasale who has been placed in Bira knows the Papuan language of On in
which is also understood there.) With the arrival of the Dutch colonial administration in
I nanwatan in 1 908, the Patipi influence diminished, although the Dutch initially ruled the
I nanwatan area through appointed Patipi raja who were called raja -comm issie (kowisi in the
Inanwatan language).
    The relationship with Onin and Patipi is strongly reflected in the oral tradition of the
l nanwatan people. For example, 1 recorded a story about Namora, the first raja of
3   Possibly reflecting my use of the Malay term bahasa Inanwatan.
                                                                               Introduction      3I nanwatan who came from Patipi (see de Vries 2000 and Appendix 2 Texts, A 1 ). He
became the father of the I nanwatanfam Nawora (see below for the notionfam).
    Whereas the Austronesian language Patipi functioned as the primary contact and trade
language in the M acCluer Gulf area in pre-European times, after the arrival of the Dutch
around 1 900 Moluccan Malay took over that role. Of course, for contacts with peoples
outside the M acCluer Gulf area, Malay had already established itself as the interregional
lingua franca in the MacCluer Gulf area long before the Dutch established government posts
there. The regional variety of Malay spoken on the Bird's H ead south coast still has
Moluccan Malay characteristics. I n fact, a range of varieties of Malay is used, from formal
varieties approximating standard Indonesian to very informal varieties with strong Moluccan
and Bazaar Malay features.","[14, 15, 16]"

1.7 Inanwatan and the Marind languages   When we compare the structural data on I nanwatan with what is k nown of the Marind
stock (Marind, Yaqai and Boazi fami lies, Drabbe 1 95 5 ), I nanwatan seems to fit the
typological picture of these Marind l anguages, both in broad outline and in details of its
morphology.
   The M arind languages are spoken in the central south coast area of New Guinea. It has
been recognized for a long time that the Marind languages display a number of striking
characteristics, aberrant from the point of view of the Trans New Guinea grouping of
languages as McElhanon, Voorhoeve and Wurm ( 1 975) noticed. The M arind languages
combine the following characteristics:
( 1 . 1 I ) the typology of Marind languages:
   (i)    the verb has a subject prefix followed by an object prefix in a basic SOY clause;
   (ii)   there are suppletive verb stems to indicate plurality of the subject (and
          sometimes of the object);
14       Chapter 1     (iii)   there are (often elaborate) gender systems with concord phenomena and with
             front vowels i ndicating masculine and back vowels indicating feminine
             gender;
     (iv)    there is coordination of fully inflected verbs instead of clause chaining with
             medial verbs, and no or marginal presence of serial verbs
   Consider the fol lowing M arind data from Drabbe ( 1 955). Examples ( 1 . 1 2) and ( 1 . 1 3)
show the gender system, ( 1 . 1 4- 1 . 1 6) show subject and object prefixes and ( 1 . 1 7) shows
suppletive plural stems of verbs:
( 1 . 1 2)   E-pe anem e-pe akek      ka .

             F-the woman F-the Iight.F          COP

             umak      'to run' (singular subject)
             bamet     'to run' (plural subject)
             takoi     'to fell ' (singular object)
             arok      'to fell' (plural object)
    The south coast area where M arind languages are spoken has a long history of large-scale,
frequent headhunting. Knauft ( 1 993) describes how this region placed particular cultural
emphasis on the creation of life-power through ritual sexuality and on the taki ng of l ifeÂ­
power by severing enemy heads. Throughout the region, ethnographers found cosmological
links between the fertility power of ritual sexuality and that of headhunting. Knauft ( 1 993)
points out how the swampy coastal plains, the many rivers, the shallow coastal waters, ful l of
fish, and the abundance of storable and transportable sago created the ecological conditions
for large scale, frequent military operations by the Marind (and other groups) which found
their cultural basis in this headhunting-ferti lity complex.
    Van Baal ( 1 966) describes the Marind headhunting practices in detail. Marind groups
used to organise their headhunting expeditions every year. The M arind war parties were
large. We know this because of confrontations with colonial officers who wrote reports at the
end of the 1 9th century. I n 1 884, for example, Captain Strachan discovered 1 200 Marind in
3 5 war canoes across the international border some 300 kilometres east of the Marind home
                                                                                         Introduction          15bases (Knauft 1 99 3 : 1 56). I n 1 8 96, Lieutenant William MacGregor encountered 75 manned
Marind war canoes and captured 48 canoes, which contained dozens of bundles of sago each
weighing around twelve pounds. This party numbered 1 500 or more persons, 250 kilometres
away from their home settlements (van Baal 1 966:7 1 3).
    Crucial for the linguistic diffusion of Marind features was the gradual establishment by
headhunting groups of corridors where groups who had been victims in the past, became
allies, in the sense that they allowed headhunting parties to cross their territories to reach
groups even further away. The M arind exported cultural characteristics and linguistic
features along these corridors. Van Baal ( 1 984) describes the situation as follows:
       Marind-Anim culture was an expanding culture, spreading from the coast to the
       interior, and along the coast from east to west. (van Baal 1 984: 1 29)
In this historical context, it is not surprising to find some of the Marind stock characteristics
in Trans-Fly stock and Ok languages to the east and north of the Marind area. Southern Kati,
for example, is a Lowland Ok language showing on the one hand Trans New Guinea features
like clause chaining with medial verbs, and subject suffixation but on the other hand some of
the Marind features are present (Voorhoeve 1 9 7 5 : 3 8 1 ) like object prefixation with some
verbs, a few verbs having suppletive plural stems and a two-gender distinction in nouns and
3S0 personal pronouns, with a back vowel (F) and front vowel (M) opposition (for example,
ye 'he', yu 'she'). The Ok languages Telefol and Ninggerum have similar patterns. Many
Trans-Fly stock languages also display one or more of the M arind features. For example,
object prefixes are widespread in the Trans-Fly stock but on the other hand subject suffixes
are very common there (see Wurm 1 975:323-344).
      W hereas Trans-Fly and Ok languages show the four Marind typological characteristics of
( I . J J ) in an unsystematic fashion, I nanwatan has t hem all: the I nanwatan data ( 1 . 1 8) and
( I . J 9) show the gender system, ( 1 .20) shows subject and object prefixes, ( 1 .2 1 ) shows
coordination of fully inflected verbs, ( 1 .22) is an example of a Past verb paradigm with a
suppletive verb stem indicating plurality:

Compare the I nanwatan data ( 1 . 1 8- 1 .22) with the Marind data ( 1 . 1 2- 1 . 1 7) above. I n the
gender systems of both languages, the back vowel front vowel opposition is used to indicate
feminine (back vowel: M arind: lui, I nanwatan 10/) and masculine (front vowel: Marind Ie, ii,
I nanwatan Ie, i/). I nanwatan has a phonotactic rule that words cannot end in a consonant,
compare:
( 1 .23)     T nanwatan      mesidae     'man'       mesidao 'woman'
             Marind          anem        'man'       anum    'woman '
The shared gender morphemes (Ii, el for masculine and lu, 01 for feminine) i n I nanwatan and
M arind are significant since these are rare outside the Marind stock: as we saw above, the
back and front vowel opposition is found in Ok languages in personal pronouns (e.g.
Ninggerum, Southern Kati), north of the Marind, one of their traditional headhunting areas
(Knauft 1 99 3 : 1 6 1 ). The Sepik and Torricelli groups also have gender systems but gender is
not indicated by vowel oppositions, with an occasional exception in personal pronouns such
as the I wam (Sepik) pronouns si 'he' and sa 'she' which have a vowel opposition between
front and mid vowels (Laycock & Z'Graggen 1 975:742).
   I nanwatan is spoken in the western part of the New Guinea south coast whereas the
M arind languages are spoken in the central part of the New Guinea south coast area. I n
between, we mostly find Asmat-Kamoro languages and some Austronesian languages. For
future research, I would like to hypothesize the idea that Inanwatan is a western member of
the M arind stock. We would have to assume that I nanwatan became separated from the
other M arind languages by the arrival of Trans New Guinea groups such as the AsmatÂ­
Kamoro, probably from the mountains, and Austronesian groups like the Patipi, probably
over sea. Admittedly, the average lexical correspondence percentage of 7 . 5 % between
Inanwatan and M arind is rather low. Wurrn ( 1 975) takes 1 2% as the boundary below which
inclusion in a stock of language families is not defendable. However, if we take structural
considerations into account, the similarity between I nanwatan and the M arind languages
could well be too great to be coincidental. Notice that the gender and subject/object crossÂ­
referencing morphology of I nanwatan and Marind is very similar, both in the morphological
pattern and in the grammatical morphemes. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of the shared
gender morphology (front vowels=M , back vowels=F) and the verbal pattern (s-o-verb) is
rather high since both are rare in New Guinea. Foley ( 1 9 8 6 : 1 38 ), for example, states:
'Marind is the only Papuan language I know which consistently exhibits A-U- V.'","[26, 27, 28, 29]"

3.9 Conjunctions
   The topic marker -qe(de) (or sometimes -qa) cliticizes to clauses and nouns. When it is a
clause clitic it functions as a subordinating conjunction with adverbial and relative clauses
(see Â§4.2.4):
(3.98)      Sidepa-o        me-i-de-qe                   nari nesiror-i-go.
            Japanese-PL 3.S-descend-PAST-SUB I          little-M-ORC
            When the Japanese came, I was a little boy.
   W hen -qe occurs in the transcribed texts with nominals that express the time, place
participant framework for the utterance, the clitic is glossed as TOP (topic):

             The man's people hold a meeting and there the parents agree about the
             daughter and (say), 'let us tomorrow collect the (bridal) payment'.
   The coordinating conjunction (-Jere, with elided form (- )re after stem-final vowels and -de
after stem-final Ii!, coordinates noun phrases and clauses.

                  I took a bath, ate and slept.
Although (-Jere almost always cliticizes to the noun phrases and clauses that it coordinates, it
does not always cliticise:

more details on their discourse functions, see Â§4.3.2.
   Two temporal conjunctions are -de 'still ' for (partially) overlapping events and -dara
'until ' when the first event goes on until the second starts, for example:

   Enclitic demonstratives - wai, -sai, -wasu function as personal pronouns for third person
objects (see Â§3.2) filling the 'gaps' in (3. 1 ). Some tentative further analysis of the pronouns
in (3. 1 ) seems to be possible. The suffix -iti marks subject forms, - we object forms, -wa
emphatic forms and -waro plurality in emphatic forms. For - iti we would have to assume the
     This chapter is a revised and expanded version of de Vries (1 996). The data are written in phonemes
     represented by the graphemes given in the Grapheme Table (see Â§2.4). Notice that the decision to write the
     allophones of Iml and Irl (see Chapter 2) means that for example the third person subject prefix me- is written
     sometimes as we- and sometimes as me- depending on its pronunciation.

28       Chapter 3allomorphs iti- (with third person subject forms) and -ri (in variation with -iti) in 1 SG and 2SG
forms.
   The oblique forms occur sometimes in a longer form (e.g. nagadara in stead of naga).
The oblique forms are used for personal pronouns with peripheral functions in the clause (see
Â§4. 1 .2 for the distinction between core and peripheral nominals in I nanwatan). The oblique
forms most likely consist of (former) postpositions attached to the personal pronouns. For the
third person forms this is certain: -ra is a postposition meaning 'to, for, about' (see Â§4. 1 .2).
So far I have not encountered a postposition -ga or -gadara . There are also combinations of
personal pronouns and the postpositions -wai 'to' (direction) and -(u)ru '(together)with'
(comitative):

    I have found the emphatic forms so far only combined with non-emphatic subject forms.
Possibly the -wa morpheme in the emphatic forms derives from the proximate demonstrative
element - wa, compare the frequent local Malay emphatic form saya ini literally 'I here'.

4. 1.2 Clause constituents
     There are two types of nom inal constituents in the I n anwatan clause, core nominals
(subject, object) and peripheral nominals. Core nominals are unmarked phrases, i.e. they do
not take postpositions, and are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes (see Â§ 3 .4 . 1 ). Peripheral
nominals take postpositions and are not cross-referenced in the verb.
     The core nominals subject and object are distinguished by order only (subject preceding
object). Only in personal pronouns is the opposition between subject and object expressed in
the form of the constituents (see Â§3 . 1 . 1 ).
  Peripheral nominals (in all clause types) may occur clause-initially (when they express the
time, place or other type of frame for the clause), but a lso pre- or post verbally when they
qualify the event or state denoted by the predicate (for example manner peripherals).
     NPs governed by -go denote time (4. 1 3 , 4. 1 5), place (4. 1 4), instrument (4. 1 5) and manner
(4 . 1 6). The postposition -go is restricted to inanimate NPs and has been glossed as CIRC
(circumstantial):

1.5 Language death and ethnic identity in the Inanwatan community    The I nanwatan people realize that their language is dying. This saddens older people but
most young people do not seem to care all that much. I nanwatan is a language they associate
with the past and a language they cannot use in cities l ike Sorong, Manokwari and Jayapura
where they would like to live, a language they cannot use in the work environments they
would like to be in. But the older people also accept the way things are going. These attitudes
to language death by generational erosion can be understood better if we realize the relatively
modest place the I nanwatan language has in the way the I nanwatan people construct their
ethnic identity.
    An I nanwatan person derives his sense of identity primarily from the gob6 and Jawu he or
she was born in. The noun goM is used for bodies of water (sea; river; lake; tributary), for
localized descent groups (clans) living on ancestral lands surrounding those bodies of water
and finally for the ancestral lands themselves. A goM consists of (ideally) four Jam (Malay)
or Jaawu (adapted I nanwatan form) with each Jam descending from a different son of the
ancestor pair (van Oosterhout 2002:95- 10 1). The ancestral lands of the gob6 cannot be
sold; only rights to use the land can be sold, but the land itself is the inalienable possession of
the clan. Clan membership is defined in patrilineal terms. The land claims of the clan, the
origins of the clan, the places where the clan has lived, rights the clan has acquired through
warfare or alliances, all these crucial things are expressed in the oral tradition of the clan, the
stories of the clan. These stories are 'owned' by the clan and people who are not member of
the clan should not know them, certainly not in the sacred versions with the real names of the
ancestors, and are not allowed to tell them. A lso within the gob6 there are differences in
terms of access to the sacred stories and to the 'knowledge' embodied in them. The secrets
are only safe with a small group of elders, belonging to certain/am within the gob6. These
                                                                             Introduction       II
are considered to be sufficiently 'dry' and 'cooled ' to be able to deal with the heating powers
of 'knowledge' (van Oosterhout 2002 : 1 0 1 ).
     Interestingly, in these clan owned stories, the ancestors sometimes do not speak I nanwatan
but Puragi, another South-Bird's Head family language, spoken in the area of the Upper
Metamani river; this area is seen as the area of origin of various groups of people who
nowadays speak various languages l ike I nanwatan and Kokoda. When I nanwatan people
visit the upper Metamani area, the use of the I nanwatan language is taboo (Dianne van
Oosterhout, pers. comm.). In I nanwatan oral stories, when ancestors sing magic chants,
often the words of those chants are Puragi (see for example Appendix 2, Part A, text 3,
no.5 ). When 1 asked people about this, some said that the ancestors spoke Puragi.
     The fact that I nanwatan is not considered the language of the ancestors, at least not by all,
 is significant to determine the place of the Inanwatan language in the identity of I nanwatan
people. And the oral tradition of the clan, containing its history and rights, is transmitted in
both the I nanwatan and the Malay language, and can be 'stolen' in both forms. The
'knowledge' embodied in the oral traditions is what counts and not the l inguistic form in
which this 'knowledge' is formulated (see van Oosterhout 2002 :99 for the I nanwatan
concept of 'knowledge' and its relation to clan owned stories and claims to ancestral lands).
     It is clear that the I nanwatan language has a place in the I nanwatan ethnic identity but the
notion of gob6 (gob6 land, gob6 flesh and blood, gob6 knowledge) occupies a much more
central place in the way the I nanwatan define themselves than the I nanwatan language.
Notice that the I nanwatan have generic words and proper names for social groups like clans
(gob6) and subclans (jaa wu) but have no word or name for I nanwatan as an ethnolinguistic
group (van Oosterhout 2002: 1 75 ) nor for I nanwatan as a language. For speakers of
I nanwatan, l nanwatan is a place name used by outsiders to label what they see as a 'tribe',
suku or 'ethnolinguistic group'. When I nanwatan define themselves in other terms than those
of gob6 and jaawu they 'skip' the level of the 'ethnolinguistic group' and switch to the Malay
                   ,political-religious discourse (kitorang Kristen 'we are Christians', kitorang Papua 'we are
Papuans').","[23, 24]"

3.3.2 Number
   Plurality is marked by a suffix -0, which replaces the last vowel of the noun stem. This
means that for the majority of nouns (which have 101 as stem-final vowel) there is no formal
distinction between singular and plural forms. Some nouns, especially k inship nouns, have
suppletive plural forms (see Â§ 1 .8.3):
3   In Puragi (see Appendix 3, Â§2.S.2), the neigbouring language to the north and east of Inanwatan, the vowel
    opposition which expresses the feminine/masculine opposition in human nouns (final /0/: female, final Ii/:
    male), expresses size/quantity in inanimate nouns, e.g. amepuri 'wind', amepul'O 'strong wind'.
 34        Chapter 3 (3.3 1 )       n6wi            my mother's brother
                n6tatabo        my mother's brothers
 3.3.3 Derivation of nouns
      Nouns referring to humans characterized by a quality X can be derived by adding -ewi (M),
-ewo (F) and -ewe (PL) to the noun denoting X, with its final vowel elided, as follows:
 (3.32)(eJ.) nato                 wound
                natewi            wounded man
                natewo            wounded woman
                natewe            wounded people
(3.33)         q6we               penis
               q6wewi             man (polite)
               oro                vagina
               6rewo              woman (polite)
(3.34)         mido               snot
               m fdewi            snotty nose (M) (abusive)
(3.35)         igo                tinea
               fgewi              (male) sufferer from tinea
               igewe              sufferers from tinea
  Nouns referring to persons habitualIy performing an action X can be derived from the
habitual form of the verb denoting X, which is X-rita . The derivational suffixes are - we (M),
-wo (F) or -(ra)saru (PL). Examples:
(3.36)         buqa-rita-we       writer Â« buqa- 'to write')
               buqa-rita-wo       (female) writer
               buqa-rita-saru     writers
               neq6di-rita-we     thief    Â« neqodi- 'to steal')
               mutau-rita-we      killer   Â« mutau- 'to kill')
   The feminine form of this derivation is used both for agent nominalization (3.36) and
event nominalization, (3.37):
(3.37)         Mutau-rita-wo-wai      bada-o-wo.
               kill-HAB-NOM-this.F bad-F-be.3.SG.F
               Killing is bad.
    A nominalized form that consists of the verb stem plus a combination of the two plural
nominalization suffixes -ewe and -saru functions as a relative clause with implicit head, for
example qai-reqa-ewesaru, literally 'the followers' in (3.38) and m6go-wo te-ewesaru, the
sitters in the jungle in (3.39):
(3. 3 8)    Qai-reqa-ewesaru       mo-ura-re    mesida-o       ura-owosu.
            follow-go.PL-NOM.PL 3.S-see-PAST person-PL DEM-those
            Those who followed (the trail) saw that there were people.
                                                                             Morphology       35(3. 39)    Narido + na-la/abo   +       maa +   ketemu-we-ge-re +       I/-[rubu

           My ancestors, eh, they met, my relatives and the ancestors, those who lived
           in the jungle.

relativiser yang.","[46, 47, 48]"

3. 4. 8 Derivation and compounding of verbs
    Adjectives are productively verbalised by affixing verbal morphology to the masculine
form of the adjective. For example, sowate 'good' is the base for me-sowate-be 'she is good'
(3.S-good-PRES.F). This form may also mean 'she becomes good' and this is a difference with
the predicative adjectives supported by the copular verb -na that do not have the dynamic
reading (see Â§3.4.7, compare sowa t-o-wo 'she is/was/will be good'). Furthermore, the
verbalised adjectives express the full range of morphological categories (tense, mood, aspect.
gender, person, number) distinctions whereas the predicative adjectives with -na express only
person, number and gender.
   I nanwatan has two productive strategies to combine verb roots (see Â§4.2 . 1 ). The first is to
combine verb roots in compound verbs. The second is to combine verb roots with inflected
verbs in complex phrasal verbs. Causative, (in)transitive and continuative verbs are formed
by both strategies. The first strategy is used to form compound verbs like uwu-ge- 'to cause
to sit', uwu-se- 'to sit continuously':
(3. 80)     Qotoqowar-e btiakuko-qai m6-uwu-ge-be.
            child-M        bench-at        3.s-sit-do-PRES. 3SG.F
            She (just) made her son sit on the bench.
(3.8 1 )    N6-uwu-se-rita.
            I SG.s-sit-go-DUR
            I am sitting all the time.
   With the verb ego- 'to cause' causative compound verbs can be formed with adjectival and
verbal roots, for example sowato 'good', sowatego- 'to repair', 6po- 'to take a bath', opoegoÂ­
'to make someone take a bath', for example:
(3.82)      M6toro me-s6wat-ego-be.
            engine 3.S-good-cause-PRES
            They (just) have repaired the engine.
44      Chapter 3I do not have sufficient data to say anything on the relation between causative compounds
with ego- and ge-. The verb ge- is very frequent, both as independent verb and in compounds
whereas I did not find many ego- compounds and no examples of its use as an independent
verb.
   The second strategy, complex phrasal verb formation (see Â§4.2. 1 ) is illustrated by (3.83)
and (3 .84):
(3.83)       Maso-we-ge-i.
             enter-3.s-do-PAST.SG.M
             He entered.
(3.84)       Mai-wo wo-uwu-i                   ewtiiwQ   +    ao nesar     awuga-era-era-ro
             here-to 3.s-sit-PAST.SG.M         and            his smithy iron-piece-piece-PL
             tetewo mogo-we-de-wo-i. #
             all     carry-3.s-go.across-come-PAST.SG.M
             Here he settled and he brought across pieces of iron for his smithy.
   The verb complex m o go-we-de-wo-i in (3.84) i l lustrates both strategies of verb
compounding (de-wo- 'to come across') and formation of complex phrasal verbs with bare
verb roots preceding the inflected verb and phonologically integrated with that inflected verb.
This second strategy seems to be used with the intransitivising root ide- in ide-wo-u-rila-re in
(3.85) that intransitivizes u- 'to fell (trees)':
(3.85)       Suq6-wai + iMu-go                  ewai + deraq6bo-go
             sago-this.F    formerly-CTRe this            pointed.stick-eIRe
             m6-u-rila-re +        tira -tira -we-i-rita-re              ewaiwa

             ide-w6-u-rita-re +            suq6-wai      ibau       ewai   suqere-wai
             INTR-3.S-fell-HAB-PAST sago-this.F          formerly this.F raw.sago-this.F
             me-tetei-rita-re.
             3.S-cut-HAB-PAST
             Formerly, they used to fell the sago palm with a pointed stick, they pierced
             it repeatedly and then it would fall and they would cut the sago palm in
             blocks of raw sago.
     1 have no example of the use of ide- as an independent verb and only one other example in
the texts of its use i n a phrasal verb:
(3.86)       Baru +      owaqepo      ciboto egeqiro mi-arouge-i
             and         stairs       top       bridge    3.S-moor-PAST.SG.M
             fde-we-qawo-i. #
             TNTR-3.S-descend-PAST.SG.M
             And he moored at the bridge and descended (from the canoe).
                                                                                Morphology        453.5 Adjectives
   The adjective, which occurs postnominally, shows gender agreement with the noun it
qualifies in both attributive and predicative uses. When the noun is mascul ine, the adjective
ends in leI, when feminine the adjective ends in 10/, for example sowalolsowale 'good',
badao/badae 'bad', ebaro/eba re 'c1oseby', eseqo/eseqe 'far(away)', tetewoltetewe 'al l ' ,
g[ro/gfre 'long', dowoldowe 'short'.(3.87)       meqaro sowal-o
             house.F good-F
             a good house
(3.88)      Meqaro ewai         sowat-o-wo.
             house this.F good-F-be.3SG.F
             This house is good.
(3.89)       FÂ£tgi    esai      apew-i-so.
            banana this.M delicious-M-be.3SG.M
            This banana is delicious.
    Some adjectives have unpredictable masculine and feminine forms, for example si 'empty
(M)' and lsido 'empty (F)'. The adjective aida 'big' has only one form, used for both genders.
The feminine form of the adjective is also used as the plural form . Some adjectives have
reduplicated plural forms. I n such cases, the feminine form, the default gender, is the basis
                                                                                       ,
for the reduplicated form. Examples: qfqe 'new (M)', qfqo 'new (F)', qiqiqo 'new (PL) ; fsido
'empty (F)', isisido 'empty (PL)'.
    There is no morphological comparative or superlative. Periphrastic constructions are used
in these contexts:
(3 .90)     Mesida-e     esai       iragir-i aida-so         ago-soi      mesida-e
            person-M     this.M .   body-M big-be.3SG.M      but-that.M person-M
            nag-e       nesiror-i-so.
            other-M liule-M-be.3SG.M
            This man is bigger than that man.
   The adjective terewo 'al l ' (3.9 1 ) is used as intensifier with adjectives in predicate position
(3 .92):
(3.9 1 )    Awuga-era-era -ro       tetewo og6-we-de-wo-i.
            iron-piece-piece-PL all      carry-3.S-go.across-come-PAST.3SG.M

   Singular is marked by -I; plural is optionally, but usually, marked by -suo The consonant
opposition Iml (intervocal ic a llophone written as w) versus lsi marks feminine versus
masculine. The vowel opposition lal versus 101 marks proximate versus distal. Notice that
the feminine singular forms are also used as plural forms. The attributive use is distinguished
by e- in the proximate and i- in the distal attributive forms. I n addition to the attributive
singular forms of (3 .20), sometimes the forms ura-wai, ura-sai, ura-woi and ura -soi are
used, as in (3.2 1 ).
(3.2 1 )      mura -garebo-wai ura-wai
              river-mouth-this.F DEM-this.F
              the rivermouth
     The form tlra also occurs on its own as a demonstrative (glossed DEM), as in (3.22):
(3.22)        Ado ado    tlra bfdo ura        me-rare-waf + ewhe-wa me-rago-re. #
              dear dear DEM pig DEM 3.S-dead-this.F who-this 3.s-pierce-PAST
              Oh dear, oh dear, the pig is dead, who speared it?
  Forms derived from demonstratives like maiwo and owoiwo are used as spatiotemporal
adverbs meaning 'here/now' and 'there/then ' :
2     In direct elicitation with Malay stimuli (Mereka baku bwwh 'They killed each other') the reciprocal form
      turned up in the following example: itiga nfogai mewutaube (they each.other they.killed).
32    Chapter 3(3.23)      Mai-wo wo-uwu-i             ewaiwa    +   ao n esaro awuga-era-era-ro

            all    carry-3.s-go.across-come-PASTSG.M
            Here he settled and he brought across all pieces of iron for his smithy.
The demonstrative based forms mai-wa and ewai-wa (-wa is probably a reduced form of
- wa i) very frequently occur as discourse-conjunctions meaning 'and' or 'next ' (e.g. (3.23)),
especially in narratives following tail-head linkages (see Â§4.3).
   The proximate, plural demonstrative clitic - wasu has also been found to express plurality
in some nouns, especially kinship nouns, for example neqide 'my father', neqide-wasu 'my
fathers'.
   I n noun phrases the demonstratives very frequently function as markers of definiteness,
(3.24, 3 .25):
(3.24)    Na wora     esai      Palipi- wolewe   we-de-wo-re.
          Nawora this.M Patipi-from         3S-go.across-come-PASTPL

   The postclitic forms function as third person subject markers Â« 3 .26), medewoi-sai) and
object markers (3.27) with verbs and as definiteness markers with nouns, (3.28):

   There are two noun classes, alienable and inalienable nouns. Inalienable nouns take
possessive prefixes and al ienable nouns free possessive pronouns. Number (singular and
plural) and gender (feminine and masculine) are distinguished in nouns. I n the plural, the
gender distinctions are neutralised.","[44, 45, 46]"

I 30    Appendix 31 The Kokoda language    The dale of the survey was 1 8 September 1 995. The i nformants were Paulus Nagora,
born in Kasueri in 1 959, Sekolah Dasar (elementary school) in Kasueri, SMP (Junior H igh
School) in Fak-Fak; Dance Kao, born in Kasueri in 1 968, Sekolah Dasar in Kasueri . Tomas
Keramu, born 1 965 in Kasueri, with Sekolah Dasar education, Matius Nagora, born 1 954 in
Kasueri, Sekolah Dasar. All informants spent most of their l ives in Kasueri and speak the
language daily and fluently. They gave information on their language in I nanwatan, the main
village of the district which has a small Kokoda section. I worked for four hours with these
men who were on their way to Sorong.
    Kokoda is the name which is used throughout the Inanwatan district for the language
spoken in de villages Kasueri (about 1 000 speakers), Migori (500 speakers), Siwatori (500),
Tarof (250), Negeri Besar (2000), Tambani (250), Udagaga ( l 000) and Nebes (number of
speakers unknown). There seem to be two dialects: the Kasueri dialect (Kasueri, M igori,
Siwatori) and the Nebes dialect (Tarof, Negeri Besar, Tambani, Udagaga, Nebes).
    The Kokoda language is much more alive than the I nanwatan l anguage. Whereas
Indonesian is often used by the l nanwatan people when they are among themselves, Kokoda
speakers use I ndonesian only for contact with outsiders. The Kokoda are divided into
protestant and islam communities. The name Kokoda seems to mean 'flooded land'. Big
parts of the Kokoda area are flooded most of the year. The houses, built on stelts in the
water, are interconnected with a kind of bridges.","[142, 143]"

4.3 Linking sentences; discourse conjunctions
   The m ulti verb sentences in the Inanwatan text corpus are linked by a number of devices.
The most important are tail-head linkage, generic verb l inkage and linkage with discourse
conjunctions.",[73]
"
3. 1.2 Possessive pronouns    Inanwatan has both free and bound possessive pronominal forms. The free forms express
alienable possession, the possessive prefixes express inalienable possession.

             3PL.F               (tig)a-wolao
   The free forms express gender of the possessor. The third person singular free forms
express double gender: male or female possessor plus the cross-referenced gender of the
possessed noun (optional gender suffixes, masculine: -so; feminine: -wo).
(3. 1 0)     tigidae-so suqere
             his-M        sago.M
             his sago
(3 . 1 1 )   tigae-so   suqere
             her-M    sago.M
             her sago
    The free forms may also be used predicatively:
(3. 1 2)     Meqaro     narid6-wo.
             house    mine-F
             The house is m ine.
   The possessive prefixes, used for inalienable nouns (body part nouns, k inship terms and a
few other nouns, see Â§ 3 . 3 ), do not differentiate gender. I nalienably possessed nouns indicate
gender by the stem-final vowel.
30      Chapter 3   The bound forms occur only in the first and second person. When possession is not
expressed on inalienably possessed nouns, third person possessors are understood, that is
m iro means 'her belly' (3 . 1 4). I n other words, inalienable nouns have either a possessive
prefix (first and second person) or imply third person possessors.
(3. 1 3)    No.-wiri       me-tutu-rita-bi.
            my-belly.M 3.S-hurt-DUR-M
            My belly is hurting. (I (male) have pain in my belly).
(3. 1 4)    Miro       me-tutu-rita .
            belly.F 3.S-hurt-DUR
            Her belly is hurting. (She has pain in her belly).
    A lthough informants used the bound forms consistently with inalienable nouns in direct
elicitation, in the texts I found free possessive pronouns with k inship terms:
(3 . 1 5)   [ri         qotoqaware-sai + nirido            qotoqawaro   +
            your(PL) child.M-this.M           our(ExCL) child.F

            fish 3.S-eat-HAB-M
            Your son has a relationship with our daughter.
  The final vowel of the bound forms is elided before noun- initial vowels (na-epe>n- epe
'my-fooLM !) but in some cases noun-initial vowels elide, for example no.-oro>na-ro 'myÂ­
vagina.F'.","[42, 43]"

4.2.2 Clausal arguments of verbs
   Perception and cognition verbs have finite object clauses immediately following the verbs.
There are no complementisers or any other formal markings of the complement nature of the
clause. An alternative analysis would be to view these clauses as asyndetically linked
coordinated clauses that are pragmatically interpreted as goals of the preceding perception
verbs.
(4 . 3 7)   Mai    wi-atuge-re + tapi qido-wo       mora-y-aigo +
            this.F 3s-fire-PAST.PL but not-be.3SG.F hit-TR-NEG

           3S-come-PAST.PL-CONN 3S-see-PAST.PL 3S-run-PAST.PL fright-CIRC
           They fired but they did not hit and they (Namora's people) came and saw
           that they (=the I nanwatan killing party) had fled with fright.
The object clause merodare arasaugo in (4.37) has no complementiser or any other formal
indication of its syntactic function.
   Another strategy to express clausal arguments is to use nominalizations (see Â§3.3.3). For
example:
(4.38)(el.) U-rita-wo       parea-y-aigo
            swim-HAB-NOM know-TR-not
            He cannot swim.","[70, 71]"

1.6 The linguistic position of the Inanwatan language   As far as links to Papuan languages are concerned, to the east and north of I nanwatan, the
Puragi language is spoken in the villages Saga, Puragi, Bedare and I sogo. Puragi belongs to
the South Bird's Head family to which Arandai also belongs (Voorhoeve 1 98 5 ). Yahadian,
of the Konda-Yahadian family, spoken in the villages Mugim and Yahadian, is the western
neighbour of the Inanwatan language. I n initial survey work, I found only 8% possible
lexical correspondences between Yahadian and I nanwatan ( 1 6 lexical correspondences in
202 items) whereas 1 found 25% lexical correspondences between I nanwatan and Puragi
(52 lex ical correspondences in 1 99 items). With Kokoda, also of the South Bird Head family
and spoken to the east of Puragi, I nanwatan has 4 1 lexical correspondences in 202 items
(20%).
   Structurally, Inanwatan shows many correspondences with Puragi and Kokoda in
phonology and morphology whereas I nanwatan is strikingly different from Yahadian in these
regards. In Kokoda and Puragi , for example, a masculine-feminine gender distinction is a
pervasive feature of the morphosyntax affecting 3SG verb forms, adjectives, demonstratives
and nouns. Their gender systems resemble the Inanwatan system very closely, with back
12       Chapter 1vowels associated with the feminine gender and with plural ity and front vowels with the
masculine gender. Example ( I . 7) is from Kokoda, ( 1 .8) from Puragi, ( 1 .9) from lnanwatan
and ( 1 . 1 0) from Yahadian:
Kokoda:

                woman-F that-F-TOP bad-F-be.F
                That woman is bad.
I nanwatan:

              person-M ATrR-this.M.SG bad-M-be.3SG.M
              This man is bad.
                Mesida -o e-wai              bada-o-wo.
                person-F ATTR-this.F.SG bad-F-be.3SG.F
                This woman is bad.
Yahadian:
( 1 . 1 O)(el.) Orame ye nanatglne.
                man     this bad
                This man is bad.
                Wa      ye   nanaigine.
                woman this bad
                This woman is bad.
On the other hand, the Kokoda and Puragi verb paradigms in my survey data have only
suffixes and I found no subject and object prefixes as we find in Inanwatan. Further research
of these South Bird's Head languages is badly needed to establi sh their relationship to
Inanwatan.
   Concerning lexical links with other Papuan language fami l ies, Voorhoeve ( 1 975 :443,
445) gives average cognation percentages of the I nanwatan fam i ly with other Papuan
language fam ilies: for example, 4.7% with the Central Bird's Head fam ily, 5.5% with the
North Bird's Head family, 8 . 1 % with the West Bird 's Head family, 7.5% with the Marind
and Asmat-Kamoro families, 7.7% with the Ok family, 5.5 with the Dani family, 7.2% with
the Awyu family, 9.5% with the Kolopom family and 4.3% with the Sentani family.
   These percentages are all below 1 0% and point in all directions: to Bird's Head language
families, to typical Trans New Guinea language families l ike the A wyu and to aberrant
                                                                               Introduction       13language families of South I rian Jaya like the M arind. Explaining the lexical links with Bird's
Head languages as borrowings, V oorhoeve ( 1 975) classified I nanwatan as a Trans New
Guinea language.
    At that time, very little structural i n formation on the Inanwatan family was available and
the Marind languages were, with some hesitation, considered as Tran s New Guinea
languages. The structural information on I nanwatan available to Voorhoeve ( 1 9 75), the
pronoun system, pointed into the direction of the Trans New Guinea Phylum. The I nanwatan
pronouns of first person have initial In!, those of second person an initial vowel and plural
forms have more fronted or higher vowels than those of singular forms. According to
Voorhoeve ( 1 975:444), such pronoun sets occur widespread in South West New Guinea and
the western h ighlands. As in other coastal areas of New Guinea with intensive contact with
Austronesian languages, lnanwatan distinguishes exclusive and inclusive first person plura l
pronouns.
    The typology and relative complexity of the morphology of l nanwatan sets it clearly apart
from the simple verb morphologies of the other Bird's H ead languages (see Reesink, ed.
 1 996, 2000, 2002). But the type of morphosyntax of I nanwatan is very different from the
typical Trans New Guinea morphosyntax of mainland Papuan language families as described
by McElhanon, Voorhoeve and W urm ( 1 97 5:299-322). I nanwatan has no clause chaining
with medial verbs, no serial verbs and no switch-reference. I nstead, Inanwatan coordinates
fully inflected verbs. I ts verb morphology also deviates strongly with its subject and object
prefixation. The presence of subject and object prefixes in the verb (s-o-v) is rare in Papuan
languages, it occurs in only three of the over sixty families of Papuan languages, namely
Marind family (Drabbe 1 955), Northern Halmahera family (van Baarda 1 89 1 ) and South
Bird's Head family. Gender pervades the I nanwatan language in ways unknown to Trans
New Guinea languages.
    Summarizing, I nanwatan most probably is a member of the South Bird's Head family of
Papuan languages. I ts lex ical l inks point in all directions. Structurally, I nanwatan is different
from both Bird's Head languages and languages of the Trans New Guinea group.","[24, 25, 26]"

3.3. 1 Geuder
    Gender in nouns is determined by the last vowel. Nouns ending in a front vowel (Ii!, lei)
are masculine and the remaining nouns (ending i n lui, 101 and la/) feminine. Phonological
gender systems (in the sense of Corbett 1 99 ] :5 1 ), as found in Inanwatan, have been found
elsewhere in New Guinea (in Torricell i and Lower Sepik families, for example Yimas, see
Foley 1 986, 1 99 1 ). The great majority of nouns is feminine.
    I n a minority of nouns gender has a semantic basis (male and female). 3 This c lass
comprises the following nouns. Nouns denoting humans (including k i nship nouns, for
example q% qawaro 'daughter', qotoqaware 'son '). Nouns denoting domesticated animals
(for example mewaqoto 'female dog' , mewaqote 'male dog'). Also included are a number of
inanimate nouns such as human body parts and body fluids (for example aruqo 'blood (of a
female)', aruqi 'blood (of a maleÂ»"" orientational nouns which take the human body as point
of reference (for example eduduro 'left (of a female)', eduduri 'left (of a male)', the noun
nero 'name (of a female)"" neri 'name (of a male)' and other nouns associated with the body
(for example awuwuro 'strength (of a female)', a wuwuri 'strength (of a male) , . Although a
minority, these nouns with semantic gender have a high profile i n the language, not only
because of the importance of kinship but also because body related nouns are used in the
expression of a wide range of lexical and grammatical meanings such as reflexivity (Â§3 . 1 .3),

as [ric] , word-initially pronounced as [nJ, for example [ 'ni13apuruJ 'fifty' from I ndonesian
limapuluh.
   Finally, an extremely frequent phenomenon is variation of [nJ and [ric] word-initially
conditioned by slow and fast speech. In citation forms and in slow pronunciation as in (2.5),
word-initial [n] never varies with [riel, but in connected speech where initial Inl is followed
and immediately preceded by vowels, the phoneme is often realized as [r/r] as in (2.6):
(2.5 )      Imumuno napagol             ['muwur:>#'napag:> ]        all rivers
(2.6)       Imumuno napagol             [ 'muwur:>#'rapag:>l       all rivers
    The nasal phoneme Iml has three allophones [m] , [w] and [ï¿½). The allophone [ m ] occurs
word-initially, [w] medially adjacent to back vowels (i.e. followed andlor preceded by [0], [u]
or [aÂ» and [ï¿½] elsewhere. Examples: ['muwur:>] 'rivers'; ['na13E] 'me (object)'.
    I n borrowed words, the medial lm] of source forms is pronounced as [w] or [ï¿½] and the
initial lw] of source forms as [m). Examples: Dutch emmer 'pail' is adapted to ['E13Er:>] 'pail'.
I ndonesian wakil 'deputy' is adapted to [,mak iri ] 'deputy headman (raja) ' , I ndonesian
kaca mata 'glasses' is adapted to [ 'kar:>watol; I ndonesian limapuluh 'fifty' to Inanwatan
['ni13apuru 1. Dutch comm issie, a term used for the Patipi headmen appointed by the Dutch
administration to rule I nanwatan, is adapted to ['bwisi] . I n morpheme sequencing, the
allophonic relationship between [m] and [w/J3] also surfaces:
(2.7)       Iminil                  ['miri]                stomach
(2.8)       Inaminil                ['na-13iri]            my stomach
(2.9)       laminil                 ['a-13iri]             your stomach
(2. l 0)    Imadidol                ['madid:>]             shoulder
(2. 1 1 )   Inamadidol              [na-'{3adid:>l         my shoulder(2. 1 2)    Imasul                  ['masu]                theylthem
(2. 1 3)    Ime?a?abi-masul         [mE'?a?abi-ï¿½asu 1      he bit them
   Finally, word-initially [ m ] and [w/13J are in variation, conditioned by slow and fast speech;
since all words end in a vowel in I nanwatan, in fast speech word-initial Iml is followed and
preceded by vowels sounds and accordingly receives a [w/{3J realization:
(2. 1 4)    lomoimo metenel         [:>'w:>iw:> 'wEtErEJ   They were there.
Uttered in isolation or in slow speech, the initial Iml is realized as [m J :
(2. 1 5)    lomoimo metenel         [:>'w:>iw:> 'mEtErE]   They were there.
Since none of the allophones of the phonemes Iml and Inl seems to ha ve the widest
distribution or highest frequency, the choice of the nasal realizations as basic allophone is
rather arbitrary. When discussing the orthography with I nanwatan people, they insisted on
distinguishing the oral allophones (represented in the spelling by w, r) from the nasal ones
(m, n). This was so important to them that they asked me to follow their orthographic
proposal in all my publications.
    Having discussed the allophones of 1m! and Inl, we give minimal pairs for these phonemes
in (2. 1 6).

2. 1.2 The glottal stop
  The m functions as a consonant phoneme in l nanwatan. Evidence for this comes from
contrasts in identical or near-identical environments and from vowel elision phenomena.
  To start with the latter, consider the following data:
(2. 1 7)   flepel        ['?EpE ]      foot
(2. 1 8)   /epe/         ['EpE]        tooth
(2. 1 9)   Ina-?epel     ['na-?EpE]    my foot
(2.20)     In-epe/       ['n-EpE ]     my tooth
   In (2.20), vowel elision takes place: the final vowel of the first singular possessive prefix
Ina-I 'my' is elided before the initial vowel of lepel 'tooth'. But in (2. 1 9) the glottal stop
functions as an initial consonant and blocks vowel elision.
   There is contrastive evidence for I?I in (2.2 1 ). Since Ikl is a rather rare sound (the majority
of occurrences is in borrowed words, see below), we have not yet found an example of
contrast in identical environment for Ik/-fl/.

2.2 Vowels2.2. 1 General remarks
     I nanwatan has these vowel phonemes:
                          Front           Central             Back
       Close              i [i]                               u [u]
       Half-close         e [E, e]                            0 [:>, 0]
       Open                                a [a, a]
      All vowels may occur word-initially, word-medially and word-finally. Vowels in stressed
syllables tend to be lengthened. The vowels lei and lal in unstressed syllables of the CV type
may show some reduction in the direction of the [;)] but this is rather rare, even i n fast
colloquial talk. Examples: ['sidEr:>] 'parrot', ['sid;)r:>] 'parrot'; [na'gaw:>] 'my chin', [n;)'gaw:>]
'my chin'. Vowels in unstressed initial syllables of the Y type show reduction in the form of
devoicing, sometimes leading to completely devoiced vowels. Example: L:>'r:>w:>] 'spear',
[1Il'r:>w:>] 'spear'.
      Sequences of two vowel phonemes frequently occur in Inanwatan. Examples:
(2.28)     100nal         [':>Era]       bind !
           I?anaol        [?a'ra:>]      crab
           laol           ['a:>]         wood
           Igamaol        ['gawa:>]      thumb
   In fast speech, the second vowel of the sequence, syllabic in slower pronunciation, may
become non-syllabic:
(2.29)      l'na.i.tij    I (slow speech, CY.Y.CY)
            ['nai.til     I (fast speech, CYY.CY)
The vowels in YV sequences may be identical (double vowels). With double vowels, usually
there are two clearly audible breath pulses in slow pronunciation. In fast speech, the double
vowels tend to be realized as a long vowel. So far 1 have found clear cases of double vowels
when morpheme sequencing results in double vowels. Compare (2.30) and (2.3 1 ):
                                                                                           Phonology   25

2.2.2 Vowel allophones and minimal pairs
Iii: fil, a close, front, unrounded vowel. Examples: l'?i?::>] 'new'; ('bs::>i] 'that'.
lei: [Â£1, a half-open, unrounded front vowel, le], a half-close, unrounded front vowel. The
allophone [e] occurs in variation with [Â£] preceding [i], [aJ and [w]. Examples: ldu'rew::>]
'bird', [du'rÂ£w::>] 'bird', ['madei] 'already', ['madÂ£i ] 'already', [Â£pa'reabÂ£l 'you (SG) know',
[Â£pa'rÂ£abÂ£] 'you (SG) know'.
lui: [u], a close, rounded, back vowel. Examples: ['uw::>l 'road ', [Â£'wou ] 'afternoon',
[mÂ£tu'turita] 'it hurts'.
10/: [::>], a half-open, rounded, back vowel; [0], a half-close rounded back vowel. [0] occurs
only before [u] and in variation with [::>] before [w]. Examples: ['sowat::>] 'good', ['s::>wat::>]
'good', ['nourabÂ£] '1 see'.
la/: [a], a central, open, unrounded vowel; [0], a backed, open unrounded vowel. [0] occurs
only before lui and 101 and in variation with [a] before [?] and [w]. Examples:
(2. 32)      l'ma?ap::>]      fire
             ['ma?ap::>]      fire
             l'na?tr::>]      my ear
             ['rna::>]        wife

2.3 Stress
    Stress is distinctive. Consider the following minimal pairs:

26      Chapter 2   Stress is a combination of pitch, force and length but pitch is the dominating element.
Stress may occur on any syllable but the last syllable of words gets stress in a tiny minority of
words only. No V.'V words have yet been found. Examples:

3.4.2. 1 Past   The Past is expressed by the suffix -re, with the phonologically conditioned a llomorphs
-de after verb stems ending in Iii and -ge after verb stems ending in lui. I n 3 SG masculine
forms, the Past suffix is -i. In verbs which do not have suppletive plural stems, the 3PL forms
are identical to the 3SG feminine forms. Examples of the Past paradigms of uwu-Ite- 'to sit;
to stay; to live' and opo- 'to take a bath':

-bi. An example paradigm of uwu-Ite- 'to sit ':

person singular forms, -hi for 3SG.M and -be for 3SG.F/3PL. An example Future paradigm of
uwu-Ite- 'to sit':
5    The I nanwatan seem to consider the previous sunset as the termination of 'yesterday' and as the start of
     'today'.

   Thus far I have found only one aspectual distinction expressed inflectonially, with the
habitual-durative suffix - rita . These tenseless forms are used for events presented as
occurring habitually, repeatedly or prolongedly. I n stories, the forms with -rita often seem to
loose their aspectual meaning and seem to function as narrative forms (see for example
Appendix 2 , text A 2 , (2 1 Â» . The 3SG masculine forms have the gender suffix -bi. An
example habitual-durative paradigm of uwu -/te- 'to sit':
(3 .50)          I SG              no-uwu-rita
                 2SG               o-uwu-rita
                 3SG.M             mo-uwu-rita-bi
                 3SG.F             mo-uwu-rita
                  J PL.EXC         nige-te-rita
                 2PU 1 PL . l NC   ge-te-rita
                 3PL               me-te-rita
    The habitual-durative suffix -rita may also be used in tensed verb forms, like Past forms.
I n that case the Past endings are used. Notice the contrasts between (3.5 1 ) and (3. 52):
(3 . 5 1 )       Mo-uwu-rita -bi.
                 3.s-sit-HAB-3SG.M
                 He is sitting.
(3.5 2)          Mo-uwu-rita-i.
                 3.s-sit-HAB-PAST.SG.M
                 He used to sit.
See also Appendix 2, Texts, for examples of tense less (Text A 2, (2) and (3Â» and tensed
forms (A 3 , (4Â» with -rita .","[50, 51]"

4.2.5 Coordination
   The coordinating conjunction -ere coordinates nouns (4.45) and clauses (4.46) i n a
semantically open way. I n coordination of nouns the conjunction c1iticizes to each member of
the coordination, in clause coordination only to the first member (m e-waga-rita-i-re i n
(4.46Â» . Asyndetic coordination of clauses is more frequent than clausal coordination with
-ere. Coordinated clauses are not constituents of other clauses, and they can stand on their
own.

affecting 3SG verb forms, adjectives, demonstratives, pronouns and nouns. The gender
system resembles the I nanwatan system very closely, with back vowels associated with the
feminine gender and front vowels with the masculine gender. Examples:
(I)      Moma-e      dfmes-i watak-aja .
         person-M that-M      bad-M
         That man is bad.
(2)      Moma      danes-o watak-omo.
         person.F that-F bad-F
         That woman is bad.
(3)      Notua-(3a-nie.
         gO-FUT-3SG.M
         He shall go.
(4)      Notua-(3a-nuo.
         gO-FUT-3SG.F
         She shall go.","[143, 144, 145, 146, 147]"

3. 4. 1 Subject and object prefixes
   The set (3.42) gives the subject and object prefixes of verbs:
36     ChaptetÂ· 3(3.42)                             subject        object
              I SG                 ne-            na-
              I PL.EXC             nige-          /1l-
              I PLlNCl2PL          ge-            l-
              2SG                  e-             a-
              3SG/PL               me-
The subject and object prefixes of the first and second person have clear forma l
correspondences with the sets of personal pronouns and possessive prefixes (see Â§3. 1 ) but the
3SGIPL subject prefix me- is completely different from the personal and possessive forms.
    Whereas the possessive prefixes undergo vowel-elision before noun-initial vowels, the
final vowels of the subject and object prefixes do not undergo elision. I nstead, vowel
sequences are formed, including double vowels, phonetically realised as long vowels, for
example Ine-era-rel 'I said' (['nE: rarE]) contrasting with Ine-ra-rel 'I held' ( ['nHarc]). The
final lei of the subject prefixes assimilates to 101 when the verb stem has an initial 101 or lui.
Examples: Ine-opo rel > ['nJ: pJrE] ' I SG.S-take a bath-PAST', Im e-uwu -gel > ['mouwugE]
                       -'3.s-sit-PAST'. The prefix final leI dissimilates4 to Iii before verb initial lal, for example
Ine-alu-gel > [ni'atugE] ' I SG.s-board (the canoe)-PAST'.
   Examples of subject and object prefixation:
(3.43)(el.) Ni-a-weigo-re.
            l SG.S-2SG.O-deceive-PAST
            I deceived you.
(3 .44)       Mi-ri-ra-rita +                miroqai-weebe + nige-tabo-be                tigo

              qotoqawar-o arewo-wai               sero     m utero. #
              child-F        woman-this.F word one
              They say to us, it is true, we have heard the same thing about the girl.
(3.45)        Awoge        meqaro naguare awoge dinasi-da-wo                      nago-wo
              again        house    one         again service-poSS-be.3SG.F one-CONN
              me-ra-wi-de           buat nanti paakai-beqewu          ma re-re-sa. #
              3.S- I SG.o-give-PAsT for later use-in.order.to(PL) there I SG-sleep-FuT
              And they gave me also a house of the (health) service to live there in the future.
   Transitive verbs with object prefixes also allow the object to be marked by an independent
personal pronoun in its object form. If so, there is no object prefix. Compare (3.43) and
(3.46):
(3 .46)(el.) awe         ne-weigo-re
             you(SG.O) I SG.s-deceive-PAST
             I deceived you.","[48, 49]"

3.7 Numerals
    The I nanwatan count on hands and feet. Counting starts on the left little finger. The
numerals from I to 4 reveal a binary system (3=2+ I ; 4=2+2). The numerals 5 (one hand),
1 0 (both hands), and 20 (one body) are body-part based and combine with the numerals for
1 -4 and with each other to form additive numeral phrases.

   Gestures tend to accompany the use of the numerals. The system is rapidly being replaced
by Malay numerals. The numerals occur after the noun and before the adjective:
(3.95)(el.) bido eri-naguare mawago
            pig two-one      big
            three big pigs
3.8 Postpositions
    A number of postpositional clitics express semantic relations of peripheral NPs to the
predicate (see Â§4. 1 .2). So far I have found -wai 'to(wards), -tewe 'from , woide 'from', -qai
                                                                               '   -'in, at', -wo 'in, at', -ra 'to, for', -(u)ru 'with' and -go, a general circumstantial postposition
occurring with time, instrument, manner and place nominals. Here I give just two examples.
See Chapter 4, Syntax, for more details.

                     Part C: Text in local Malay of Inanwatan
   The following fragment exemplifies the type of regional Malay spoken in Inanwatan,
recorded and transcribed by the anthropologist Dianne van Oosterhout. The narrator is Bapak
Magawe of the Solowat clan, around 70 years old. Told on January 7, 1 996, it is a part of
the story of the catching of the moon.

          Appendix 3: Survey data of the
          languages of the Inanwatan
          district    This appendix presents survey data concerning the languages of the I nanwatan district.
Since the Austronesian language Patipi, spoken in the Bomberai peninsula, has had a major
role as contact-language in the I nanwatan district until M alay took over that role in the
beginning of this century, I will also present Patipi data.
    I found 8 % lex ical correspondence between Yahadian and Inanwatan ( 1 6 corresponding
items in a l ist of 202 words) whereas I found 2 5 % lexical correspondence between
l nanwatan a nd Puragi (52 corresponding words in 1 99 items). Furthermore, I nanwatan
shows many correspondences with Puragi in phonology and morphology whereas the
Yahadian phonology and morphology are strikingly different from I nanwatan and Puragi.
Since lexical correspondence percentages tend to turn out much higher in later research than
revealed by initial surveys, the results of my survey shed doubt on a separate status of the
I nanwatan family (Voorhoeve 1 97 5 ; Berry & Berry 1 987). Of course, further research is
needed to establish l nanwatan as a member of the South-Bird's Head family. I used the
Summer I nstitute of Linguistics (Irian Jaya) 209 item survey list to collect lexical data.
    Besides Inanwatan the following five languages are spoken in the I nanwatan district
(kecamatan):
   1.   Kokoda (South Bird's Head family), approx. 6000 speakers, villages: M igori,
        Kesueri, Tarof, Negeri Besar, Tambani, Udagaga.
  2.    Puragi (South Bird's Head family), 1 400 speakers, villages: Puragi, Saga, I sogo,
        Bedare.
   3.   Benawa (South Bird's Head family), 800 (?), villages: Benawa 1+1 1 , Sumano, Atori.
  4.    Kais (South Bird's Head family), 600 speakers, village: Kampong Baru on Kais river.
  5.    Yahadian (Konda-Yahadian family), 1 1 50 speakers, villages: M ugirn, Yahadian.
    In this appendix I present data on Kokoda, Puragi, Yahadian and Benawa. Unfortunately,
   have no data on Kais. See Map 2, Languages of the Bird's Head, for the location of
l nanwatan and its neighbouring languages.","[140, 141, 142]"

1.8.3 Kinship
     l nanwatan kinship and social organization is discussed by van Oosterhout (2002). Here
1 give some morphological properties of kinship nouns.
   Kinship nouns belong to the class of inalienable nouns (see Â§3.3). I nalienable nouns take
possessive prefixes. In Table 1 they are given with the first person singular possessive prefix
na- 'my' (with vowel elision n -).
   Kinship nouns occur in a male and a female form, e.g. n oware 'my grandson', nowaro
'my granddaughter', with stem final front vowels (Ii, e/) indicating male referents and back
vowels 10, ul female referents.
   A number of kinship nouns have irregular plural forms while others use the proximate
plural demonstrative c1itic -wasu to mark plurality.
   The parent terms naqide 'my father' and neqido 'my mother' are a lso used by many
speakers as the I nanwatan equivalents of the Malay terms bapak and ibu . So the actual
usage of these kinship terms is complex and co-determined by regional Malay patterns.
                                                                             Introduction     19   Table 1 presents forms and ranges of reference of kinship nouns found i n elicited, very
incomplete data. M=mother, F=father, S=sister, B=brother, H=husband, W=wife, e=elder,
y=young, s=son, d=daughter, ... =male ego, , =female ego.","[31, 32]"
"
3. 4. 6 Non-finite forms
   A non-finite verb form consisting of just the reduplicated verb stem is used to indicate
simultaneity of events in durative contexts. This reduplicated form may either precede or
follow the main predicate.
(3.64)(el.) A reta ni-ri sera me-qe-rita.
            food eat-eat word 3PL.s-speak-DUR
            They are eating and talking.
(3.65)         Ne-se-rita           [we            ura-w-ura.
               I SG.S-walk-DUR you(PL.O) see-TR-see
               While I walk, I a m watching you.
  The second non-finite form consist of the verb stem with the suffix -i. The verb form
qualifies a finite verb that it follows or precedes in an adverbial manner. For example:
(3.66)         Ererao       t[go ma-ge-tira-i             me-i-de
               other.PL     so     thus-do-take-ADV 3.S-descend-PAST
8     Sometimes (qe)qfdo combines with -aigo to form (qe)qiduciigo.
                                                                              Morphology    41            ererao   ura m-owe-re            gaqeto-wai. #
            other.Pl OEM 3.S-go.Up-PAST headwater-this.F
            While some thus descended, still others went up to the headwater.
   The third non-finite form found so far is a purposive infinitival form consisting of the
verb stem plus the suffix -beqewu with singular subjects and -birowu with plural subjects:
(3.67)      Ma-ge-re-re           mawago-wasu meigo-weigo +           ago Muguro-wotewe +

4.4.3 Adjectives
   The attributive adjective follows the noun with which it agrees in number and gender (see
Â§3.5).

(4.69)      Mesida-e rag-e esai           nuirouru-sai     tigo Duweqau        egi-sai +
            man-M         one-M that.M offspring-this.M so          Duweqau   father-this.M
            meqaro-wo-qede + saa-wai              mi-atu -ri-aigo          sai-tigo
            house-in-?                water-this.F 3S-ascend-not.be-NEG this.M-so
            mewoqo-wasu me-qugo-i. #
            dog-these        3S-cut-PAST.M
            One man with his children, the father of Duweqau, was still in the house and
            while the water rose, the man slaughtered his dogs.
   Only in the following elicited example the adjective and the numeral combine i n one
phrase. Since the Malay stimulus (tiga babi besar) has a totally different syntax (NUM N
ADJ), chances for Malay interference are small:
(4.70Xel.) bido eri-naguware mawago
           pig two-one       big
           three big pigs
The h igher numerals are asyndetic coordinate phrases, as in the following example:
(4.7 1 )    newo-wa sugeri newo-gaago           nagiare (touching right little toe)
            hand-PL both         hand-side       one
            sixteen
Most speakers use Malay loan numerals and/or switch to Malay for numeral expressions:
(4.72)      Me-ta-i            awoge     me-wo-i +         i-sai
            3.S-go-PAST.M again           3.S-come-PAST.M be-this.SG.M
            mai-wo-qe + awoge           ru            keredidall n-e-rita    dllaberas
            now-at-TOP        again     together.with work       I SG-do-HAB 1 2

            He went away and returned and he is here now and I work again with him
            this day, December 1 2th.","[78, 79]"
