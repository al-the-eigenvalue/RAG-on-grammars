       There is one basic negative morpheme in Karajá, -ko); suffixed to the verb, it negatesthe entire sentence (73). It can also occur with the pro-form ♀ ado) ‘thing’ (♂ao)), forming a
negative particle which negates individual constituents of the sentence (74) and also occursin answers to yes/no questions (75b). The negative morpheme, followed by the imperfectiveclitic, can also be used in such circumstances (75c). An emphatic morpheme, hÈkÈ (♂hÈkÈ),
occurs with ado)ko) or a verb to convey a strong negation (75d).(73)   ♂       Î´kI Oha)            ∅-r-I-rOèko)

8.12 Questions
       There are two basic interrogative morphemes in Karajá, èbo and èwE; both seem to
be used interchangeably, though èbo tends to be more common. They combine with the pro-forms ♂ado) (♂ao)) ‘thing’, bo) ‘human’, and ÎI ‘circumstance (time, place, manner)’ to forminterrogative words (76-78). Notice that entire phrases (76d, 78d), referring to the focus of
the question, can be situated between the pro-form and the interrogative clitic.

as a second-position clitic, to situate the focus of the question on specific constituents of the
sentence (80).

8.13 Numerals       Karajá has numeral words (or constructions) for the concepts ‘one’ to ‘twenty’. Fornumerals ‘one’ to ‘five’, there are single words (81). Some of these numerals seem to bemade up of more than one identifiable, albeit fossilized, morpheme, including third personprefix i-, bIkOwa ‘companion’, èdo) ‘indefinite article’ (as suggested by stress and itsbehavior in male speech), and kÈre ‘half’. The use of words such as ‘companion’ with thenumeral ‘four’ is also found in other lowland South American languages (Green 1997), andcould be an areal phenomenon. The numeral ‘five’ could arguably (and rather speculatively)
                                                65
be segmented as i-ru-kÈrE [3-eye-half] ‘the half (of both hands?)’, a descriptive constructionincluding ru ‘eye’, the classifier for ‘round, small things’ such as beans, beads, and coins.","[73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"
"        Purpose clauses are constructed with the postposition èb´) attached to verbs in thefuture or potential. This is probably an extension of the use of this postposition to indicatedestination (see 2.6 above).20(55)    i-ha)wÈÈèO idZoi           a-r-a-dÈèk´re

        ‘We will take you to his wife in order for you to marry her.’
5.1.1. Nominal imperatives        A common type of negative imperative is formed with an action noun followed by thepostposition èb´) and, optionally, either the future marker èkre or the potential marker èkE.2120
   The use of destination adpositions to mark purpose clauses is commonly attested, as in English (I came to see
you) and Portuguese (eu vim para vê-lo).
21
   Notice that the future and potential markers are also optional in verbal imperatives.",[255]
"       At any rate, although the regularity of phonological processes remains a major tenetof historical linguistics, there are well-documented cases in which semantic or functionalfactors may interfere with such regularity. A rather illustrative example is provided byGoddard (1991:60), in discussing Cheyenne vis-à-vis Proto-Algonquian:       “Cheyenne […] shows one intriguing development that is not yet explained:
       *p and *k are both dropped, but only, it would seem, optionally; where
       doublets can be compared, the form with retention has a diminutive meaning
       beside the form with loss […]. Such doublets appear to point to the negative
       semantic conditioning of a sound law, surely not a very common type of
       sound change.”",[177]
"
       Likewise, the preservation of /k/ in Karajá female speech could be seen as the resultof a negative sociolinguistic conditioning of a sound law—again, “not a very common typeof sound change”. The synchronic variations in the degree to which k-deletion takes place,coupled with its productive application even to recent loanwords, are in themselves veryenlightening, demonstrating how a phonological rule gains a life of its own once it is investedwith a sociolinguistic function.",[177]
"           Bybee’s predictions apply well to languages such as Georgian, for example, wherethe opposition between the particles mo ‘hither’ and mi ‘thither’ seems to be productive onlywith lexemes denoting some sort of “notional direction towards a goal” (Manning1996:250).33 However, in Karajá all verbs inflect for direction, including those thatapparently do not indicate a motion at all, such as UrU ‘to die’ (2) and EkÈw´TE ‘to get tired’(3), as shown by the examples below:(4)        a.      rurure                                      b.       durude

                   ‘He died (thither).’                                 ‘He died (hither).’(5)        a.      rekÈ5w´Tere                                 b.       dekÈ5w´Tede
                   ∅-r-∅-EkÈw´TEèr-e                                    ∅-d-∅-EkÈw´TEèd-e
                   3-CTFG-INTR-get.tired=CTFG-IMP                       3-CTPT-INTR-get.tired=CTPT-IMP
                   ‘He got tired (thither).’                            ‘He got tired (hither).’
           This suggests that, besides its basic, strictly directional use, directional inflection isalso used for other purposes. Analyzing the use of the directional markers in narrative texts,this section explores the hypothesis that directional inflection can be used to show empathyrelationships between the participants of the speech act and between narrator and characters33
   The grammatical category expressed by the opposition between the particles mo and mi is called ‘orientation’
in Georgian linguistics, whereas the term ‘direction’ is used to refer to another grammatical category, which
“consists of a multi-term system of preverbs, arranged in opposed doublets such as ‘in’ versus ‘out,’ ‘up’ versus
‘down,’ etc.” (Manning, op. cit., 250) The use of the term ‘direction’ in this paper coincides with Talmy’s (op.
cit., 135) definition: “[Direction] refers to whether the Figure in a Motion event is moving toward or away from
the speaker.”",[187]
"8.7 Attitude markers       Karajá presents a number of discourse-oriented particles, indicating mostly theattitude of the speaker in relation to what he or she is uttering—examples of which are èkOrI
                                              57
‘admiration, surprise’, èT´) ‘boredom, repetitiveness’, èTO ‘excitement’, èlǨhǨ ‘compassion’,
and èkOT´d´) ‘doubt’. These attitude markers (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 161) are, in general,unstressed, and appear cliticized to the first syntactic constituent of the sentence. Theirdistribution is exemplified by the particle èTO in the example below:(65)      a.     ♀       bikuTO         k´dOkakre
                         bikuèTO          k´-d-∅-Okaèk´re
                         rain=EXCIT       3-CTPT-INTR-rain=FUT
                         ‘It will rain (and that’s great).’
8.8 Tense       Tense does not occur as an inflectional category in Karajá. Instead, tense distinctions areencoded by temporal-aspectual auxiliaries and particles that cliticize to the main verb. Aswith main verbs, the auxiliaries -ErI ‘progressive’, -a ‘perfective’, and -e ‘imperfective’inflect for direction (and, in the second person, also for person), as shown by the examplesabove. The particles èk´re ‘future’, èkE ‘potential’, and èhEd´) ‘admonitory’, restricted tothe irrealis mood, are invariable.      A finite verb in Karajá is typically inflected for allcategories (person, direction, and voice/valence) and followed by a temporal-aspectualauxiliary or particle.","[68, 69]"
"In (79) above, èdokuri attaches to a postpositional phrase. The examples below illustrate itsoccurrence with noun phrases (81) and a predicate (82):(81)    ♂       b´-d-a-lOèkE,                   biuèdori         k´-d-∅-Oaèk´re                                                 255

               ‘I won’t go, because it is dangerous.’
       In fact, its distribution and phonological behavior suggest that èdokuri belongs in thelarge class of speech-act particles, that inform on the attitude of the speaker with relation tothe utterance (indicating certainty, doubt, excitement, boredom, sympathy, surprise,assertiveness, resolve, etc.). As other speech act clitics, èdokuri is unstressed; notice that,unlike adpositions, èdokuri does not change the stress of the verb phrase to which it attaches;thus, i-Oha)ruèr-eèdori ‘because it is dangerous’ is pronounced [iOha)""ruredori].","[266, 267]"

       These tense and aspect markers have traditionally been considered as inflectionalaffixes (Fortune & Fortune 1964, Fortune 1973; Maia 1998). However, a more recentanalysis has shown that they are, in fact, clitics (Ribeiro 1996). As such, they can attach toany element occurring as a predicate, including postpositional phrases (66), pronouns (67),and nouns (68):(66)   ♂       waÎau          Î´b´)raèuèr-e

               ‘It is said that, in the old times, lightning bugs were the fire of mankind.’
       Auxiliaries and particles belong to clearly-distinct grammatical categories, based onsemantic, morphological, and distributional criteria. Semantically, particles are moreproperly described as modals (future, potential), while auxiliaries are more properlydescribed as aspectual markers (progressive, perfective, imperfective). Morphologically,particles are invariable, while auxiliaries are inflected, forming a defective sub-class of verbs.","[69, 70]"
"       Chapter 4 deals with complex sentences. Subordinate clauses in Karajá are always theresult of sentential nominalizations, not only in the cases of relative and complement clauses,but of adverbial clauses as well. It is here claimed that adverbs in Karajá do not exist as anindependent part-of-speech (or, at least, constitute a marginal part-of-speech with very fewmembers), adverbial functions being played by postpositional phrases. Consequently,adverbial clauses are postpositional clauses, marked by the same postpositions which marknouns. Their use as subordination markers mirrors their use with nouns, even in the case ofconverbs—by far, the most common type of subordinate clauses--, which are marked by alocative postposition. Considering the role they play with adverbial clauses, postpositions aredescribed in this chapter. A case of discourse (rather than grammatical) subordination, the=dokuri clause, will also be described in this chapter.",[82]
"4. Complementation15
   The fact that Maia does not signal any pause between both sentences corroborates my analysis of these
examples as cases of subordination, not juxtaposition of two independent clauses (‘the man threw the arrow; he
saw the guariba monkey’), which would be a rather odd construction in Karajá, given the lack of particles
marking any type of relation between the last clause and the preceding one.
16
   Maia’s original transcriptions of these examples are (i) weriri Dolora dewinade kau awire and (ii) Hãbu wyhy
rehura asynihiky-my robina. In addition to the overall shortcomings of Karajá orthography, Maia’s
transcription also presents some inaccuracies of its own. For example, the verb ehu ‘to throw’ takes objects
marked with the instrumental postposition èdI, never a ‘bare’ object as Maia’s transcription suggests. This and
other inaccuracies are corrected in (41) and (42) above.",[250]

                                          Morphology1. Introduction
         This chapter describes Karajá’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition tomorphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles andclitics. Most of the chapter will be devoted to verb morphology, which is where most ofKarajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb inflects for person (with portmanteaumorphemes which also indicate mood), direction (which also play evidential functions), andvoice (transitive, passive, and antipassive), besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns(sometimes with classificatory purposes). Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics andparticles, respectively. As in many other lowland South American languages, nouns,postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share person-marking paradigms. Sincepostpositions have already been described in Chapter 1, and their semantic and syntacticcharacteristics will be further discussed in Chapter 5, they will not be dealt with in thischapter. Section 2 describes the inflectional properties of verbs. Section 3 deals with theinflectional properties of nouns and briefly discusses the small class of personal pronouns,outlining their main differences in relation to nouns. Section 4 discusses derivationalmorphology, describing processes used to create new noun (Section 4.1) and verb (4.2)stems.","[182, 183]"

        The system of directional markers in Karajá presents characteristics that traditionallydefine an inflectional category, such as obligatoriness, semantic and formal regularity, andproductivity (Anderson 1985:163; Bauer 1988:73-87; Bybee 1985:11). The existence ofdirection as an inflectional category seems to be a fairly rare phenomenon. Talmy(1985:135), for example, in a survey of grammatical categories, states categorically thatdirection “is not marked inflectionally.” According to Bybee, this would be due to its lack oflexical generality:      By definition, an inflectional category must be applicable to all stems of the appropriate semantic
      and syntactic category and must obligatorily occur in the appropriate syntactic context. In order
      for a morphological process to be so general, it must have only minimal semantic content. If a
      semantic element has high content, i.e. is very specific, it simply will not be applicable to a large
      number of stems. [Bybee 1985:16-17]
      That is, since the category of direction would in principle be relevant only for motionverbs, it would not apply to a sufficient number of verbs to constitute an inflectionalcategory. Thus, besides being commonly expressed lexically such as in Portuguese levar ‘totake away’ versus trazer ‘to bring’ and English come versus go, and by clitics, direction isalso found expressed derivationally, such as in Latin eo¤ ‘I go’, ex-eo¤ ‘I go out’, trans-eo¤ ‘I goacross.’ However, as Bybee (op. cit., 17) observes, “each of these prefixes has a limited                                                      175
lexical applicability, for they are only appropriately added to verbs indicating motion of somesort. Their semantic content prevents them from meeting one of the criteria for inflectionalstatus.”","[185, 186, 187]"
"2.2.3 Pragmatic restrictions and evidentiality: the speaker as an observer         Despite the pervasiveness of directional marking in Karajá, a preliminary study(Ribeiro 2002) revealed what seemed to be a striking gap in the directional paradigm: theoccurrence of centripetal markers with progressive verbs seemed to be rather limited. 3636
   Another unexplained gap remains to be further investigated: the absence of centripetal marking with
perfective verbs, marked by the auxiliary èr-a. In addition, as I mentioned above, non-verbal predicates
(‘descriptives,’ postpositional phrases, etc.) do not occur with the centripetal marker, although they take the
                                                        187
As it turns out, this apparent exception is due to somewhat unusual pragmatic constraints,rather than to a morphological idiosyncrasy. Although a few occurrences of 3rd person verbsin the centripetal direction could be found in the text corpus (19), there are no examples ofcentripetal progressive verbs in the 1st or 2nd persons. The example below is from atraditional Karajá story:

        ‘She saw his old skin, Tainá’s old skin, it was there [visible to her].’
        As it turns out, unlike its counterparts with imperfective, future, or potential verbs, aprogressive verb inflected for centripetal direction conveys an extra piece of evidentialinformation, implying that the narrated event is being witnessed by the speaker (or bywhomever is assigned the role of deictic center; see (19) above): da)rÈbEèd
                                                                          dErI ‘he is talking[and I’m witnessing him talk],’ dUrUèd

         Note that the second sentence in the fragment above presents the particle èlǨhǨ,which indicates ‘compassion.’ This reinforces the interpretation given here of centripetalmarking as a mechanism to signal empathy towards a given character. As we have seen inChapter 1, Karajá presents a number of attitude markers, discourse-oriented particlesindicating the attitude of the speaker in relation to what he or she is uttering—examples ofwhich are èkOrI ‘admiration, surprise,’ èka ‘certainty’, èTO ‘excitement’, èlǨhǨ‘compassion’, èd´) ‘sympathy’, and èkOT´d´) ‘doubt.’ The interaction between directionalmarking and such particles constitutes a rich theme to be explored in future studies.","[197, 198]"
"Notice that, in such cases, the converb clause is usually a word-by-word repetition ofinformation given in the preceding sentence:
relationship between the main and subordinate clause; thus (iii) the interpretation of this relationship is inferred
from the pragmatic and linguistic context.” As we have seen, these are exactly the characteristics of the
converb constructions in Karajá.
24
   In this example, the first persbon prefix fuses with the intransitive prefix.",[260]
"       The use of directional inflection to signal empathy relationships between participantsof the speech act is particularly clear with non-motion verbs, for which both centrifugal andcentripetal marking options are available without great semantic constraints. In such cases,the use of a centripetal marker seems to imply that the speaker is somewhat more involvedwith the process described by the verb. That is why centripetal marking seems to bepreferred in situations where advice is being given, such as in the constructions (12) and (13)below, marked by the admonitory particle èhEd´). On the other hand, the use of centrifugalmarking in such constructions would fail to convey the concern of the speaker with the fateof the addressee.(12)   kOwOrUkO        makOwOn´)kEkI                  b´dETEhEn´)

       Furthermore, in imperative constructions, marked by the potential particle èkE, theuse of centripetal markers seems to convey a higher degree of camaraderie (14b, 15b), whilethe use of centrifugal marking would suggest a more distant relationship (14a, 15a).(14)   a.      idZ´kÈ wakoku             bEl´kÈkE

       In narrative texts, especially those narrated mostly in 3rd person, directional inflectionis frequently used to signal which character the speaker chooses to be more relevant for thestory, by assigning to him or her the role of deictic center. This function of the directionalmarkers in Karajá is similar to the role played by obviation systems, such as the oneoccurring in Algonquian languages. In these languages, according to Dahlstrom (1999:36),“if more than one third person is mentioned within a certain syntactic domain, then the thirdperson most central to the discourse is referred to by proximate forms (of nouns, pronouns, orverb agreement) and the more peripheral third persons are referred to by obviative forms.”","[192, 193]"
"3.6 Use of female speech by men, and vice-versa         Examples in which the k-dropping rule may or may not apply cannot be confusedwith cases in which a male speaker deliberately uses female speech forms. In fact, as inKoasati (Haas 1964) and Yana (Sapir 1949), female and male speakers can use each other’sspeech forms when ‘impersonating’ a character of the opposite sex, such as when narrating astory or baby-sitting. Thus, if a male speaker is, for example, quoting a female character orbaby-talking to his daughter, he will use plain female speech in doing so.16 Inversely,women will use male speech forms when quoting a male character or baby-talking to a babyboy. The use of female speech by a male speaker is further illustrated by the sentence below,
16
  A very interesting question to be investigated is when and how are the distinctions between female and male
speech learned by the child. According to Fortune & Fortune (1975:115), “at about age three, mothers start
insisting in the Karajá tribe that boys use only men’s speech. This is the beginning of the socialization process
which continues until the adult male is admitted to the men’s house where no young initiate would ever use
women’s speech.” However, the observance of the female-male speech differences in baby-talk suggests that
these distinctions start being acquired much earlier.",[160]
"
       Gender-related speech differences such as the ones found in Karajá (and Koasati(1964), Chiquitano (Falkinger 2002), etc.) can be seen as a matter of gender deixis, in thesense that, as Folley (1997) points out, “some actual linguistic elements are indexicals ofsome fact about gender […]. The choice of a set of forms over the other can be said to pointdirectly to the speaker’s sex.” Throughout this dissertation, the symbols ♀ ‘female’ and ♂
‘male’ will be used to indicate such deitic value of a morpheme. Since forms such as kai andÎ´kI can be used by both male and female speakers, they are left unmarked.",[37]

   Similar constructions have been called ‘absolutive clauses’ by some authors. According to Thompson &
Longacre (1985:200-203), absolutive “is a cover term for a subordinate clause type in which the following
conditions hold: (i) the clause is marked in some way as being subordinate; (ii) there is no explicit signal of the
                                                       248
grammatical point of view, there seems to be no reason to distinguish converbs from theother postpositional phrases described in the preceding sections. However, there is a crucialdifference between them: while the clauses discussed earlier are commonly marked for tense,converbs generally are not. Since typical finite clauses in Karajá are characterized by thepresence of a tense-aspect marker, a distinguishing feature of converbs (as opposed to theother postpositional clauses) is their nonfiniteness (which, according to Haspelmath, is adefinitional characteristic of converbs).","[255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260]"

6. Dokuri-clause        Besides the ‘postpositional clauses’ described in this chapter, a few otherconstructions can also be probably treated as functional equivalents of adverbial clauses. Themost common among them is the dokuri-clause, characterized by the presence of the second-position clitic ♀ èdokuri (♂ èdori). Such clauses have an explicative function and can be
translated using English for (80) or because.(80)    ♂       ÎiOèhE          b-∅-∅-Ud´),

                ‘You better stay, for I’m going far.’
        Maia (2002:155) analyzes ♂ èdori as a ‘focus marker,’ which is probably a mistake:
being a second-position clitic, it is not surprising that this morpheme occurs after frontedelements, but that is also the case of most discourse-oriented particles in the language (seeChapter 4). Fortune (1970) translates it (rightly, I think) as ‘because.’ As a second-positionclitic, èdokuri attaches to the first constituent of the clause, regardless of its syntactic status.","[265, 266]"
"8. Final remarks       Karajá presents a pervasive and straightforward mechanism to create subordinate clauses,shared by relative, complement, and ‘adverbial’ clauses alike. This device is clausenominalization: an entire clause is nominalized and, as such, can occur in all the positionstraditionally occupied by noun phrases (including subject and direct objects, objects ofpostpositions, and noun modifiers). Clause nominalization (a syntactic process) differs fromlexical nominalization (a morphological process) in a number of ways, the main one beingthat the former preserves all the inflectional properties of the verb. With subordinate clausesoccuring in the position of a bare nominal (that is, a noun phrase not followed by
28
     Notice that in both nominalizing suffixes, -dV and -TV, ‘V’ is a copy of the last vowel in the verb stem.",[271]
"         Another possible origin would be a more general, delimiting use of stress (common inlanguages where stress is predictable), to mark the boundaries of the noun phrase. However,given the lack of comparative evidence, one can only speculate on the origins of suchphenomenon.133.4 Previous descriptions         In spite of its extreme pervasiveness, the phenomenon of the ‘subordinating accent’was not mentioned in previous accounts of Karajá grammar (Fortune & Fortune 1964,Fortune 1970, Fortune 1973, Maia 1998). In his typological study, Maia states that he wasable to find “hypothetical relative constructions” only through direct elicitation, “similarstructures not being detected in the texts analyzed” (Maia 1998:33).14 The “hypothetical”here relates to the fact that he could not identify any relative pronoun (or any subordinatingmorpheme, for that matter) in the constructions considered. Notwithstanding this, theexamples of “hypothetical relative constructions” that he provides (reproduced below with12
   This ‘subordinating’ morpheme could have been a nominal clitic, such as an article (which would thus pair
with the indefinite article ♀ èdo)).
13
   Sinchronically, one could postulate the existence of a ‘zero clitic’ to account for the stress shift. Since this
more abstract analysis does not necessarily present any analytical advantage, I will adopt a more concrete
analysis in this paper, indicating the stress shift whenever necessary.
14
   Although Maia’s statement seems to suggest that relative clauses are less common in texts than in elicited
materials, that is certainly not the case. Most examples in this paper were indeed taken from texts, where
subordination is extremely common. In fact, all the subordinate clause types here described are highly favored
constructions in Karajá grammar.",[249]
"A case in point is the noun b´dE ‘time, ground, world’, which occurs in a number ofidiomatic expressions as an ‘empty’ object (b´dE + rÈrÈ ‘remember’ > ‘to become sad’; b´dE+ buka ‘disagree; not fit’ > ‘to be unlucky, when fishing, hunting, etc.’; b´dE + kErÈ ‘toknow’ > ‘to realize’). This word also occurs in non-idiomatic constructions, as the subject of‘atmospheric’ verbs (‘to cool down’, ‘to become silent’, ‘to become dark’, etc.) or as anobject. In its more idiomatic uses, b´dE can cliticize to the verb or even be incorporated intoit; as the examples below demonstrate, vowel harmony triggered by the first vowel in theverb root buka extends all the way to the object b´dE (78). Vowel harmony between the verband its object is further illustrated by (79), a curse, where the clitic èr-e ‘imperfective’triggers vowel harmony throughout the verb, reaching the object ruE ‘eye’.(78)   a.      waha            b´dE    ∅-r-I-bukaèra [b´deribu""kara]

6.1.3 Vowel harmony and grammatical function           As metaphony in Portuguese (which serves to distinguish nouns from verbs, andsecondarily reinforces gender and number distinctions), vowel harmony in Karajá (or its lackthereof) may play a role in grammatical distinctions. Although a finite verb in Karajágenerally ends with an aspectual-modal clitic, such a clitic may be suppressed in casualspeech. As we have seen, two of the aspectual-modal clitics, èkre ‘future’ and èr-e‘imperfective’, can trigger vowel harmony. The latter, by far the most frequent aspectual-modal clitic, can be suppressed while still triggering vowel harmony (80)—a case ofassimilation in absentia, as I mentioned elsewhere (Ribeiro 2005:103). Vowel harmony maybe, in such cases, the sole mark of aspect. On the other hand, the lack of vowel harmony is,to a certain extent, a mark of aspect as well, in examples such as (81) and (82) below; the factthat such examples do not display vowel harmony is in itself an indication, by exclusion, thatsuch verbs are not imperfective (marked by the harmony-triggering clitic èr-e) or future(marked by èkre).(80)       bEraètSi      ∅-r-E-TEè∅        [re""Te]

"         Although the previous studies do mention the existence of such exceptions, they failto notice a very remarkable fact. Even among the words for which the k-dropping rule ispossible there are differences concerning the degree of obligatoriness with which thedifferentiation takes place. That is, while for some words k-dropping is obligatory, for othersit is optional. According to this criterion, words presenting a velar stop may be classed intothree different categories: (a) absolute exceptions, that is, words for which the deletion of /k/does not occur at all; (b) words for which the k-dropping rule is optional; (c) words for whichthe k-dropping rule is obligatory.13 Tables 3, 4, and 5 below show examples of members ofeach class:Table 3.3.

       Notice that the adverbial-like subordinate clauses above are structurally identical torelative clauses which modify oblique domain nouns (as seen in Section 3 above), except forthe lack of a domain noun. That is, the locative clauses above can be analyzed as headlessrelative clauses. This structural identity between relative clauses and adverbial clauses is notunusual. As Thompson & Longacre (1985:179) point out, adverbial clauses expressing time,location, and manner can commonly be paraphrased, in many languages, “with a relativeclause with a generic and relatively semantically empty head noun: time, place, andway/manner, respectivelly;” such clauses have also in common the fact that they can bereplaced by a single word, an adverb, such as today (time), here (location), and quickly(manner) in English and other languages with a clear class of adverbs.","[253, 254]"
"5.5 Postpositions as discourse connectors        Reflecting their use with adverbial clauses, third-person forms of adpositions are usedas discourse connectors (corresponding to conjunctions in languages such as English andPortuguese): Îai ‘therefore, because of that’, idI ‘then, after that’, etc.",[265]
"8.3 Morphosyntax       Karajá is an SOV, head-marking language. Core NP arguments—that is, subject anddirect object—are not morphologically marked. Pronominal subjects are expressed by aseries of free pronouns, such as ♀ dIkar´) ‘I’ in (28) below, while pronominal objects are
                                                37
expressed by a series of bound morphemes, such as wa- ‘1st person’ in (29). In contrast to afairly simple nominal morphology, Karajá presents a complex verb morphology, beingtraditionally described as having a very irregular fused set of prefixes indicating person,aspect, object, and direction (Fortune & Fortune 1964, Wiesemann 1986, Maia 1998).","[48, 49]"
"Lastly, I would like to thank my professors at the University of Chicago, to whom I owe anymerits this dissertation may have. Many of the ideas in this dissertation grew out of classes Itook with Jerry Sadock, Amy Dahlstrom, Michael Silverstein, Salikoko Mufwene, JohnGoldsmith, Kostas Kazazis, Anthony Buccini, and Gunnar Hansson, among others. Chicagoprovided me with a deeper understanding of the value of theoretical diversity and with a setof analytic tools which I will forever cherish in my career as a linguist. I was particularlyfortunate to have in my dissertation committee linguists who, while having solid reputationsas theoretical linguists, equally value data-oriented linguistic analysis: Amy Dahlstrom, JerrySadock, and Michael Silverstein. I am particularly indebted to Amy Dahlstrom, not only forher contributions to my education as a linguist, but also for her kind support andencouragement, without which this dissertation would not have come to light.

The Iny and their language   The main purpose of this dissertation is to provide an introductory grammar of Karajá, aMacro-Jê language spoken along the Araguaia River, in Central Brazil. Karajá has threemutually-intelligible dialects—Karajá proper, Javaé, and Xambioá. Karajá proper can befurther divided into Northern and Southern Karajá. Combined, the four dialects have a totalof approximately three thousand speakers (Silva 2009), in the Brazilian states of Goiás, MatoGrosso, Tocantins, and Pará. The dissertation takes into account data of all four dialects,collected by the author in several field trips. Except for the Xambioá dialect, Karajá is quitevigorous in sociolinguistic terms, being the first language to be learned by the children andthe language used in everyday life in nearly all of the villages.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"       Analyzing èdokuri as a speech act clitic helps us to understand the differencesbetween dokuri-clauses and the reason clauses described above: dokuri-clauses are probablyexamples of speech act adverbial clauses, whose function, as defined by Thompson &Longacre (1985:203) “is not to modify or qualify the main clause in any way, but to modifyor qualify, as it were, the speech act which the speaker is performing in uttering the mainclause.” In fact, most attitude markers can be seen as speech-act subordinators to a certainextent, since they anchor the utterance to a previous one; in an example such as (83) below,the attitude markers èTOE ‘enthusiasm’ and èT´) ‘repetition’ can only be interpreted inreference to a previous speech act (it was jokingly said as a warning to a child who insisted inclimbing a tree against a parent’s repeated admoestation):(83)   b´-d-∅-UrUèkreèTOEèT´)

7. Nominalized complements       Corresponding roughly to the subordinate clauses described above, one commonlyfinds nominalized forms of the verbs playing the role of complements. Deverbal nouns maybe preceded by a grammatical possessor which corresponds to the original absolutiveargument of the verb—that is, to the subject of an intransitive verb, such as in wa-rira ‘mywalking’ (from ♀ rika ~ ritSa ‘to walk’), or to the object of a transitive verb, such as in
kOÎUd¸) b´)d´) ‘turtle catching.’ (from b´) ‘to catch’). These constructions occur in any of thefunctions performed by subordinate clauses (or by any NP, for that matter)—that is, assubjects (84), direct objects (85) or objects of postpositions (86-91):(84)   ♀       ir´      ÎaraTa      ∅-r-I-wa-d-EkÈw´TE-d´)èr-a

        Complement clauses are those which occupy the position of a noun phrase, occuringas arguments of the verb or as objects of postpositions. Like relative clauses, complementclauses in Karajá are also characterized by stress shift.

       Passive verbs are marked by the prefix a-, with class I stems such as TUhO ‘to wash’(57b), or its zero allomorph, with class II stems, such as -uka ‘to split’ (57b). Notice that thisis apparently the same prefix that occurs with basic intransitive verbs such as rika I ‘to walk’and -obi ‘to see’. With transitive roots, however, this prefix will always convey a passive oranticausative meaning.(57)   a.      d-a)dI        wa-Î´kÈ      ∅-r-I-TUhOèr-ErI

       In the passive construction, the original O becomes the subject, as in languages suchas English, for example. However, unlike English, where the agent in a passive constructioncan be expressed as an oblique (‘by-phrase’), in Karajá the agent, although sometimesimplicit, cannot be expressed at all. Thus, passives in Karajá are both a backgroundingconstruction, functioning to delete unknown or irrelevant subjects, and a foregroundingconstruction, since it results in the promotion of the original O to subject position (Foley andVan Valin 1985).","[63, 64]"

interjections expressing surprise or admiration (♀ bi, ♂ bEbE). Examples such as these--
involving interjections and other “emotive words”--are rather common in other languages.","[151, 152]"

       Since the velar stop is generally suppressed in male speech, the formal identitybetween the verb root and the deverbal noun can be rather obfuscated. For example,although the verb roots ♀ aka ‘to run’ and ♀ ka ‘to dig’ may become homophonous in male

speech (♂ a), their deverbal nouns will still differ: ara ‘the action of running’ versus ra ‘the
action of digging’. Therefore, a regular derivational rule can only be identified if the femalespeech is taken into consideration.93.2. d-dropping         This process consists in the deletion in the male speech of an alveolar nasal consonantoccurring in the corresponding female speech form. It seems to involve only two morphemes
9
  A misunderstanding of the male-female speech distinctions may also lead to erroneous ethnographic
statements. Thus, Donahue (1982), appraising the antiquity of Karajá agriculture, suggests that the Karajá word
for ‘corn’ entered the Karajá lexicon through a European language, and that, therefore, the cultivation of this
product was a recent introduction into Karajá culture:         The Karajá word for corn is mai, which happens also to be the French word for corn, both
         surely derived from maize, a word of Carib [sic] origin. It could well be that corn was
         introduced to the Karajá by Europeans after contact, an interesting case of circuitous
         diffusion. If such an American staple of corn were introduced by Europeans, it might indicate
         that the Karajá have come to horticulture quite a bit later than many other central Brazilian
         tribes. [Donahue 1982: 83]Donahue would probably have reached a different conclusion if the female speech form, ba)ki [ma""ki] (which, as
Ehrenreich suggests, represents “an older form of the idiom”), were taken into consideration. Another example
is the analysis of Javaé sexuality suggested by anthropologist Patrícia Rodrigues (1993), based on the mistaken
assumption that the words for ‘vagina’ and ‘skin’ were homophonous:         “[…] the fact that tyky means both ‘skin’, ‘clothes’, and one of the words for ‘body’, and also
         ‘vagina’, could mean that, contrary to western conception, which restrict sexuality to the
         genital organs, the Javaé would understand the whole female body as an extension of the
         vagina, an eroticized whole. The skin that covers the entire body would be as eroticized and
         permeated with sexuality as the genital organ, a notion that transforms the woman (as
         wife/sexual partner) into a sexual being […], as a whole, and not only as a possessor of sexual
         anatomic parts.” [Rodrigues 1993: 312]Interesting as it may sound, this hypothesis does not find any support in the linguistic data. In fact, the words
for ‘skin’ and ‘vagina’ may become homophonous in the male speech, but only when pronounced in isolation.
Since there is a constraint against surface monosylabic words, the word for ‘vagina’, ÎÈ, will be pronounced as
ÎÈÈ when occurring by itself, and, given the phonological processes described above, the word for ‘skin,
clothes’, Î´kÈ (ÎÈkÈ, in Javaé and Xambioá) may be optionally pronounced as ♂ ÎÈÈ. Homophony between these
two words is limited to these cases. They never become homophonous in the female speech. Even in male
speech, they will never become homophonous when combined with other morphemes: i-ÎÈ ‘her vagina’, i-ÎÈÈ
‘her/his/its skin, clothes’.","[149, 150]"

pro-form ♀ ado) [a""no)] ‘something’ (♂ ao)). The indefinite article attaches to entire noun
phrases (13). The pro-form ♀ ado) generally occurs in combination with emphatic,
interrogative, and discourse particles (14). It also occurs in combination with thenominalizer suffix -da) (15)10.(13)     ♀        hirari ruSeraèdo)                     ♂ hirari ruSeraèo)

         Therefore, this process occurs only with a closed set of words, all of them containingthe morphemes ado) and èdo). An apparent exception is the word ♀ ado)da) [ano)""na]
‘pineapple’, which is probably a loanword of Tupí-Guaraní origin, either from Tapirapé orfrom a Tupí-Guaraní-based lingua franca spoken in Brazil in the first centuries of thecolonial period (cf. Tupinambá ananá). This word also undergoes the process of d-dropping
10
   The indefinite article is probably also present in the numeral ♀ ida)Îado) [ina""Îano)] ‘three’, ♂ ida)Îao)
[ina""Îao)], as suggested by the fact that the stress in this word occurs in the penultimate syllable. In Karajá, the
stress generally falls on the last syllable of the word (as shown in Chapter 2), the only exception being clitics,
such as the indefinite article èdo), which are intrinsically unstressed.","[150, 151]"

  These semantic characterizations are approximations. For the concepts of figure and path adopted here, see
Talmy (1985:129), who defines figure as “the salient moving or stationary object in a motion event” and path as
a category which “refers to the variety of paths followed, or sites occupied, by the Figure object.”

  Although the range of meanings displayed by some of the Karajá pospositions may at first seem unusual, it is
very easy to find parallels in other, well-known languages such as English or Portuguese. The use of locative
postpositions with temporal purposes (as a metaphorical extension from location in space to location in time),

name, think and tell (that is, the complements denoting that which is said, heard, thought,asked, or told) are also marked by the postposition èb´) (15).

                  ‘My friends call me Kawina.’for example, is a rather common phenomenon. Even more idiosyncratic uses of postpositions (as non-canonical
markers of what would be translated as direct objects in English) may also reflect cross-linguistic tendencies.
As Jespersen (1965:159) points out, verbs for ‘to throw’ take objects marked as instrumentals in many
languages, including Old Norse. The use of a locative posposition to mark the object of a verb such as ♀ rakuSi
‘to eat’ (♂ roSi) is paralleled in English by the use of on in constructions such as deer feed on grass or the
castaway lived on coconuts for weeks.
6
  This apparent diversity of meanings could be due not to polysemy, but to homophony (that is, instead of these
being instances of different meanings associated with a single postposition, it could be the case that there would
be different postpositions with the same phonological shape). However, the fact that a postposition such as èb´)
presents the same irregular allomorphy in all the uses mentioned above seems to rule out the hypothesis of
accidental similarity.","[236, 237, 238]"
"4.1 Verbalization       Any noun can be turned into a verb by means of the verbalizer suffix -d´). Althoughthe meaning of the derived verb may at times be idiosyncratic, verbs formed in this mannercan generally be translated as ‘to provide OBJ with NOUN’ (when transitive) or ‘to be providedwith NOUN’ (when intransitive).",[220]
"2.2 Temporal constructions7
 As in English or Portuguese, the verb aha ‘to find’ is also used with an ‘evaluative’ meaning (as in I found the
play annoying). In this case, the evaluative phrase is marked by the postposition èb´):(i)        ha)bu  i-bIdaèb´)           Îai      ∅-r-∅-ahaèr-e

    Another verb which presents a similar irregular behavior is o) ‘to drink’.",[240]
"        The evitative postposition indicates what is to be avoided or feared, marking theoblique complements of verbs such as -UbErU ‘to be freightened’ (4) and wO ‘to hide’.3 Anexample of the temporal postposition (‘when’) is given in (5) below. Besides indicatingsource (‘from’), the ablative postposition marks objects of comparison (6).(4)     ♂        wa-riOrE       Îorièèlau       ∅-r-∅-UbErUèr-ErI

  A good example of the problem posed by the translation of adpositions is the preposition by in English, which
has instrumental (he went by train), locative (he is by the fountain), and temporal (I’ll be back by midnight)
uses, among others. The criteria to determine the ‘basic’ meaning of postpositions may be fairly arbitrary. In
labeling the Karajá pospositions, I took into consideration what seems to be their more general, productive, and
non-idiomatic uses (as far as possible).

  Kariri, a Macro-Jê language remotely related to Karajá, also has an evitative postposition (Mamiani 1877:77).
According to Blake (1994: 156), evitative (also called ‘aversive’) case markers are also common in Australian
languages.",[236]

most of the stock, however, regular phonological and grammatical correspondences are stillbeing uncovered, but one has to keep in mind the limitations mentioned by Goddard (op. cit.)for Algic:
   “[…] it is methodologically instructive to note that this is a case in which the
   comparative method produces a proof of genetic relationship without there being a
   reconstructed phonology or phonological history beyond what is implied by a handful
   of equations of identity, or near identity.”","[278, 279]"
"         Karajá, like most (if not all) Macro-Jê languages, lacks adjectives as an independentpart of speech. In languages lacking adjectives, their functions tend to be expressed by nounsor verbs. The tendency, in Macro-Jê studies, has been to describe ‘descriptives’ (i.e., wordsexpressing adjectival functions) as verbs, an interpretation which has also been proposed for

Notice that thisis apparently the same prefix that occurs with basic intransitive verbs such as rika ‘to walk’and -obi ‘to see’. With transitive roots, however, this prefix will always convey a passive oranticausative meaning.(31)   a.      nadI            waÎ´kÈ            rITUhOrErI

         In the passive construction, the original O becomes the subject, as happens inlanguages such as English, for example. However, unlike English, where the agent in apassive construction can be expressed as an oblique (‘by-phrase’), in Karajá the agent,although sometimes implicit, cannot be expressed at all. Thus, passives in Karajá are both abackgrounding construction, functioning to delete unknown or irrelevant subjects, and aforegrounding construction, since they result in the promotion of the original O to subjectposition (Foley and Van Valin 1985).","[205, 206]"
"       Fonseca’s visit marks a turning point in the relationship between the government andthe Karajá. The governors of Goiás were now interested in bringing the Indian tribes underthe watchful eye of the government, through the creation of official settlements(aldeamentos) gathering different ethnic groups, generally away from their traditionalterritories (such as São José dos Mossâmedes, located south of Vila Boa). Hundreds of Javaéand Southern Karajá would agree to join the aldeamentos, only to later abandon thembecause of widespread death by disease and mistreatments. Closer to the indigenousterritories, the government would create presidios, military outposts which would be oftenattacked and destroyed by the Karajá and Javaé (allied with other indigenous tribes such asthe Xerénte). Despite such opposition, aldeamentos and presidios would gradually contributeto the weakening of native resistence. In 1850, the presídio of Leopoldina was founded nearthe mouth of the Vermelho River. Though destroyed and rebuilt more than once, the presídiosignals a permanent official presence in Southern Karajá territory. With the consolidation ofLeopoldina, later a town (today’s Aruanã), the Karajá were now in closer contact with thenational, Portuguese-speaking population. An increased Brazilian presence in the Araguaia,

both in Leopoldina and in Southern Pará (near the territories of the Xambioá and NorthernKarajá) also meant that it was safer for naturalists, such as Castelnau, and ethnographers,such as Ehrenreich, to travel up and down the river, contacting the Karajá and collectinginformation on their language and culture. In most of its extension, however, the Araguaiawas still free from permanent Brazilian settlements, a situation which would last well into the20th century. Despite initial attempts to increase the commercial use of the Araguaia, withthe creation of steamboat lines in the second half of the 19th century, such initiatives wereshort-lived. Although limiting the influx of large waves of colonists, the lack of economicprosperity did not mean an end to the Karajá’s troubles. The Xambioá, once described as themost prosperous and numerous among the Karajá-speaking groups (Ehrenreich 1891), wouldcome close to extinction, victims of military actions and epidemics (Toral 1992). In thebeginning of the 20th century, there were only a few scattered Xambioá families, whichwould later be gathered by the SPI (Serviço de Proteção ao Índio), a forerunner of FUNAI.","[19, 20]"
"Corresponding to manner adverbs (‘quickly’, ‘swiftly,’ etc.), Karajá has nouns followed bythe postposition èb´) (wÈèb´) ‘quickly,’ etc.). Thus, just as most adverbial functions areplayed by postpositional phrases, functions traditionally associated with adverbial clauses areplayed by ‘postpositional clauses’ in Karajá.

  One candidate for adverbhood would be widZi ‘today, now’. The locative morphemes ÎU, Îab´), and Îai
(which, as we have seen, are suppletive third-person forms of postpositions) could also be alternatively
analyzed as adverbs. Even if these morphemes are considered as adverbs, this would be a closed class in
Karajá.",[253]
"5. Descriptive words        A number of Macro-Jê languages—including Karajá--are traditionally described aspresenting an active-stative verb agreement system to some degree. According to Fortune &Fortune (1964) and Maia (1998), Karajá verbs are divided into two different classes, activeand stative, with the latter consisting essentially of predicates which denote adjectivalmeanings, the so-called ‘descriptive verbs.’ These predicates take a series of person markerswhich partially coincides with the pronominal object markers in transitive verbs, and whichhappens to be the same series of possessive prefixes occurring with nouns. A more carefulexamination, however, demonstrates that such ‘verbs’ are, in fact, nouns, and that transitivity,rather than stativity, plays a central role in Karajá grammar.",[223]
"Pronominal subjects are expressed by the independent pronouns ♀ dIkar´) (♂ dIar´)) ‘I’, kai
‘you’, and Î´kI (♂ ÎII) ‘he/she/it’, all of which can be pluralized by the morpheme -boho
(dIkar´)-boho ‘we (exclusive)’, kai-boho ‘you (plural)’, and Î´kI-boho ‘they’). Non-subjectpronominal NPs (such as direct objects, objects of postpositions, and possessors) areexpressed by a series of pronominal affixes (Table 11). The noun id´) ‘human, people’followed by the pluralizer -boho works as a first person plural inclusive pronoun. A major12
  Although the word waha would appear to contain the first-person prefix wa-, it cannot be segmented. There
are suppletive forms for both the second- (bU ‘your father’) and third-persons (Î´bÈ ‘his father’).",[49]

"Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics and particles, respectively. As in many otherlowland South American languages, nouns, postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs shareperson-marking paradigms. Comparative evidence plays an important role in explainingless-than-transparent morphological devices, such as linking prefixes (which, as it turns out,are cognates with similar prefixes in other Macro-Jê languages), synchronically invariableroots with fossilized prefixes, and a non-concatenative mechanism to derive nouns from
