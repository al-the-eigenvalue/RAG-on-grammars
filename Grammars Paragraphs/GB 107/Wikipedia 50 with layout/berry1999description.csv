6. 1 . 1 YES/NO QUESTIONS
   There are many characteristics that distinguish yes/no questions from other structures in
the world's languages. Characteristics listed by Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 8 1 ) in order of
frequency in their sample were: rising final intonation contour, a sentence-initial particle, a
sentence-final particle, special verb morphology and word order. Abun yes/no questions are
marked with an optional sentence-initial particle and an obigatory sentence-final particle.
   The structure of a YES/NO question in Abun is:                                         (te) CLAUSE e
  The Yes/No Question Marker e is always used in yes/no questions. However, the 'Initial
Question Marker' te is always optional and more often than not is omitted. Of those yes/no
questions studied, about 35% used te o Examples 6 . 1 and 6.2 illustrate typical yes/no
questions, showing that with or without te the meaning is the same.
   6 . 1 a.   Te    nan kra        it     e?
              IQM 2sG marry        O\M       YNQ'v1
              Are you married?
         b.   Nan kra      it  e?
              2sG marry O\M YNQ'v1
              Are you married?
   6 . 2 a.   Te   nan nai nan bi                 suk       it       e?
              IQM 2sG get 2sG POSS                things    O\M      YNQ'v1
              Have you got your things?
         b.   Nan nai nan b i          suk            it    e?
              2sG get 2sG poss things                 O\M   YNQ'v1
              Have you got your things?
    One of the most striking characteristics of yes/no questions noted by researchers is a
rising-final intonation contour (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 1 8 1 ). An analysis of the intonation
patterns in Abun yes/no questions reveals the opposite, that is a falling final intonation
contour. The intonation pattern for interrogati ve sentences is the same as that for indicative
sentences. Therefore intonation is not such a significant distinguishing feature of yes/no
questions in Abun as it is in many other languages. Ultan ( 1 978:230) points out that in his
79-language sample, those languages that had prepositions always had a rising terminal
MARKED MOODS                                                                                  1 03contour intonation pattern. Abun is clearly an exception to this (see Figures 6. 1 and 6.2 below
which contrast yes/no and confirmative question intonation patterns).
   There are three basic systems for short answers to yes/no questions: yes/no,
agree/disagree and echo systems. Abun speakers use a mixture of these systems: an echo
system for positive responses; and a negative particle, nde, for negative responses. They do
not have both positive and negative particles for answering like the English 'yes' and 'no ' ,
but rather they only have the negative particle. When a question such a s that in example 6 . 3 i s
asked, a positive answer would be the echo, 'There is cooked food ' . Frequently such answers
may be shortened even further, a possible response to 6.3 being rna 'there i s ' . A negative
response would require the use of nde 'no ' .
   6.3       A     kon   suk    a            yo   jon    e?
             2sG cook thing PAUSE            some cooked YI'Q\1
             Have you cooked anything?
   Although Abun speakers use an echo system for positive responses, their body-language
responses to yes/no questions uses a yes/no system. Raising of the eyebrows means 'yes ' ,
and turning up of their nose means 'no ' .","[114, 115]"
"
1 2.7 NEGATIVE CONJUNCTIONS
   The final group of Abun conjunctions all contain the negative particle onde. When a single
clause is negated in Abun it is negated by means of two particles which bracket the verb
phrase. So clause negation has the structure:
                                 SUBJECT + yo + VERB PHRASE + nde
   But there is another type of negation in Abun which occurs on the level of the complex
sentence. Within a complex sentence whatever is expressed by the first clause can be negated
by means of onde. Onde always occurs together with some other conjunction. These create a
group of conjunctions which are termed 'negative' conjunctions. Sentences that use these
negative conjunctions have the following structure:
                             CLAUSE 1 + onde-CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 2
   Semantically this is most basically expressed as 'not clause one, clause two ' . It has been
claimed earlier in this chapter that Abun complex sentences show much influence from
Papuan languages. It is interesting to note that Barai, an unrelated Papuan language, also has
two distinct means of negation. In the words of Foley and Van Valin ( 1 984: 1 92), one of
these ""ba ... negates the entire clause and roughly means 'it is not the case that' .. .it is the only
element that ever follows the verb in heavily verb-final B arai"". The fact that this form has an
equivalent meaning to the Abun onde is another factor which confirms the influence of
Papuan languages on Abun syntax.
   Table 1 2 .4 below lists all the negative conjunctions. Fuller explanations and examples of
each are given afterwards.
                                TABLE 1 2.4: NEGATIVE CONJUNCTIONS                         C ONJUNCTION                    MEANING

PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNcnONS                                                             225(i) onde-wo 'but really'
   The negative meaning of onde can be clearly understood when it is part of the contrastive
conj unction onde-wo. Any clauses linked by onde need to be understood semantically in the
following way:        CLAUSE 1                       onde-                                CLAUSE 2
        event asserted                 not the case, instead                reallaltemative event
The event expressed by clause one is stated positively; it is not marked as negative within the
clause by means of the negative particles yo and nde. However, whatever was asserted by
clause one is not the case, and so this clause is negated by means of onde. Therefore the
event expressed by clause two is, in the speaker' s opinion, the real situation. If the clause i s
linked b y a negative conj unction other than ondewo, the event expressed b y clause two
indicates an alternative situation to that expressed in clause one. Thus ondewo links clauses
expressing a false and true contrast. For example:
   1 2.77    Yenggras      njim    do  re   ndar       syut       nok      ondewo
             elders        think   COM here dogs       bark.at    wild.pig but.really
             ndar syut     pa       kaiyi.
             dogs bark.at child actual
             The old men thought that the dogs were barking at a wild pig but actually the
             dogs were barking at a child.
   1 2.78    An     ki     do Sem       ana ben  brek            ne      ges    ondewo
             3sG    say    COM Sem      FOC make plate           DEI'    fall   but.really
             an    dakai ben      ges.
             3SG self        make fall
             He said that Sem was the one who made the plate fall but really he himself
             caused (it) to fall.
(ii) onde-sa 'otherwise (would)'
   Onde-sa is made up of the sentence negator onde and the realis or past time conjunction
sa. The combined meaning of the two creates a conjunction that is counterfactual. Again the
structure of the sentence using onde-sa is broken down semantically below to explain clearly
the meaning of these types of sentences.
       CLAUSE 1                     onde-sa                             CLAUSE 2
       event asserted               (if) not so, instead                different outcome, past
   The event expressed by clause one is given in the indicative. These events may or may not
be true. The second clause describes a situation that would arise in the event that clause one
was negated. Onde represents the negation. Sa indicates a past time setting to both the event
and the outcome described. In this type of sentence both the event and the outcome may refer
to hypothetical situations. Even so, sa indicates that whether hypothetical or not the events in
question would have occurred at some time in the past, rather than in the future. In these
sentences onde links clauses in a counterfactual manner giving the meaning: 'If the events
expressed by clause one had not happened then the events expressed by clause two would
have ' . Since Abun has no English equivalent to the conditional 'if' , this meaning is merely
for the purposes of good translation. However ""Counter-fact propositions need not be
226                                                                                    CHAPTER 12associated with conditional ADY clauses."" (Giv6n 1 990:83 1 ), as is the case here. That is to
say, a counterfactual proposition does not need to be marked by overt conditional means
only. A language may use other means to indicate this. For example:
   1 2.79     Su-gane men ku           Ron onde-sa,              men yo       ku sugum
              with-that 1 PL meet      Ron otherwise-REAL        1 PL NEG     get money
              wa men ma            nde.
              for 1 PL come NEG
              1 . At that time we met Ron, otherwise we would not have had money to come
                 (here).
              2. If, at that time, we hadn't met Ron we would not have had money to come
                 here.
   In the sentence above clause one expresses a factual situation which did actually
occur-the participants met a man who gave them money. Clause two expresses a
hypothetical situation which would have arisen if they had not received the money-they
would not have been able to pay for fares to return to their village. The usage of sa indicates
to hearers that this speculation i s about past events. Example 1 2.80 below i s similar. It
contains the variant onde-sor-sa. This adds a component of meaning similar to 'it was j ust as
well that...'
   1 2.80     Nu-won       ga mo A iwom ndo, ndo sato         yewon yo                        gu
              house-shaman REL at Aiwom good good for.example shamans NEG                     kill
              yu         0      nde, wo onde-sor-sa            be yen         gu    yu    to.
              RER.. again NEG but otherwise-just-REAL later people kill RER.. still
              1 . It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was good
                  in that the shamans didn't kil l each other any more. B ut otherwise they would
                  stil l be killing each other.
               2. It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was good
                    in that the shamans didn ' t kill each other any more. B ut if not they would
                    still be killing each other.
   In the preceding two examples the meaning component that sa adds to these clauses is
that of its primary meaning-it is functioning as a tensed conjunction indicating past time.
The following example differs from 1 2 .79 and 1 2.80 above in that here sa is functioning
according to its secondary usage-it adds the notion of 'subjunctive' to the first clause. Abun
has no lexical equivalent to the subjunctive 'should' . Therefore the translation of 1 2. 8 1 below
indicates this.
   1 2. 8 1   Nin   mbros     kwem     ne     sino,   onde-sa              pa

              You should have all rowed that canoe, otherwise if one of you rowed alone and
              then there was a really violent wind, then what would he have done?
   Example 1 2. 8 1 above is a reprimand by an older woman to certain young people. A s
such it could also be translated a s 'Would that you had all rowed that canoe' . This also is
PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                            227subj unctive. It expresses a wish or desire that past events could have occurred in a better
way.46 As such this clause refers to a hypothetical past event. What actually happened in this
case was that one young man was left to row the canoe alone against a strong wind.'
    Because Abun has no morpheme to represent a hypothetical situation such as the English
'if' , it is only by context and knowledge of the events described that hearers encode what is
hypothetical and what is fact. The function of onde is to negate the contents of the preceding
clause. On its own it does not attach truth value to these clauses. Therefore when onde is part
of the conj unction onde-wo, it is used to express the semantic notion of 'contrary to
expectation ' . When part of the conjunctions onde-sa and onde-yo, onde i s used to express
the notion of 'contrary to fact' .
(iii) onde-yo 'otherwise (will)'
   Onde-yo differs in meaning from onde-sa in the matter of time setting only. In clauses
linked by onde-sa, the 'tensed' conjunction sa indicates to hearers that the time setting of the
sentence and its contents are in the past, events described therein have already occurred.
However, when the conj unction changes to yo, hearers understand that the event expressed
by the second clause is non-past. These events have not actually occurred and may be
hypothetical in nature also.

               1 . You sweep up that mess down there, otherwise you will not get any more
                  biscuits !
               2. If you do not sweep up that mess down there, you will not get any more
                  biscuits !
  Givon ( 1990: 8 3 1 ) makes the following comments about counterfactual conditionals
which are relevant to this discussion of negative conjunctions.
       In addition to the subordinators that (may) mark them, counterfact clauses tend
       to be marked, cross-linguistically, by a combination of two semantically
       conflicting verbal inflections:
       (a) A prototypical realis operator, such as past, perfective or perfect: and,
       (b) A prototypical irrealis operator, such as: future, subjunctive, conditional
           or a modal.
   According to Givon this 'semantic conflict' arises if a clause is marked with both a realis
and irrealis 'operator' or one clause may be marked realis and the other irrealis. This situation
may arise as given in example 1 2.83 below. The first clause is marked by the perfect aspect
marker reo However, the usage of onde-yo in sentences is very similar to the usage of the
46    Just as Abun has no word for the modal 'should' neither does it have an equivalent to the
      subjunctive verb 'wish' . The subjunctive usage of sa is the nearest Abun equivalent for expressing
      this notion.
228                                                                                  CHAPTER 12conj unction yo on its own. If a sentence describes a predictive or procedural situation, then
onde-yo is used.
   1 2.83    Yen       gu     or           re, onde-yo             ye       si      rna
             people    kill   completely   PERF otherwise-IRR      people   go.with come
             rno nu       de, yen         bi    n                nai.
             to house side people give ginger.root 10
             They would kill off (all those people). If this is not possible the (young) people
             with them (the older shamans) will come to the side of the house (and) give
             ginger root to (the people they want to kill).
    Onde should not be understood as a negative conditional such as the English ' unless ' . It is
possible to give an alternative translation for example 1 2.83 above as 'Unless you sweep up
that mess down there, you won't get any biscuits ! ' However, as seen in examples 1 2.77 and
1 2.78 above, which use onde-wo, onde does not always have the meaning of a negative
conditional. When used as part of onde-wo it has the meaning of negative contrast. Usage of
onde indicates some kind of semantic contrast between the propositions involved. This i s
achieved b y negation o f the content o f the first clause.
(iv) onde-bere 'otherwise.cERT'
   This conjunction differs from the others by the addition of the time word bere
'FlITURFfIater' . There are several variants of bere which need to be explained. These three
variants concern the differences in the way Abun speakers view future time. These variants
are:
                       ber     soon, shortly
                       bere    later, definitely�will
                       be      later, likely/probably� could    All these variants could be translated as 'later' or 'will' in regards to future time. Ber is
used to indicate that the future time specified is in the near future. However, with bere and
be the matter of future time proximity is unspecified. What is specified is the degree of
certainty that the speaker attaches to the future event described. Hence, if the speaker feels
that the event is a certainty then bere is used, meaning 'definitely will ' . If the speaker
attaches less certainty to the future event taking place then be is used, meaning 'probably
will' or 'could'. Both these time words can be joined to onde to create counterfactual
conjunctions. These conjunctions link events that are non-past or future time in the same way
as the conjunction onde-yo. By choosing onde-bere or onde-be rather than onde-yo the
speaker adds the semantic element of 'degree of certainty' which is not present in the case of
onde-yo. In regard to counterfactuals Givon ( 1 990: 832) notes that ""many languages allow
further gradation, most particularly of events/states that are j udged to be unlikely but not
altogether impossible"". The gradations referred to here are from possibly true to not true.
The gradation expressed in Abun is in the other direction, from probable to certain . Abun has
no adverb or modal form which means 'definitely' or 'certainly' . Thus these concepts have
been incorporated into these future time words. Examples showing the use of onde-bere and
onde-be are given below:
PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                                229   1 2.84    Nan ma   kem su    ji                   more, onde-bere           suk-onde         re

             2. If you don' t go and get it I could beat you !
(v) onde-ge 'otherwise-then'
   This final counterfactual conjunction does not indicate time setting of the clauses involved.
The conjunction ge 'then' is joined to onde to indicate sequence of events. It is not as
frequently used as the other counterfactuals. The example below has several variant

10.2.5.2 SYNTACTIC RESTRICTIONS
   Since the predicates 'want' and 'believe' cannot allow negative raIsmg due to lexical
restrictions, the only other predicate eligible for negative raising in Abun would be nut
'think' . Examples of negative raising with this predicate are not found in Abun. The
following examples show a complement clause containing a negative as in example 10.46
and then an unacceptable sentence where this negative has been 'raised' in 10.47.
     1 0.46    Ii nut do ji           yo ku        nan gro 0    nde.
               Is think CDM I so NEG meet 2so eye again NEG
               I thought that I would not see you (ever) again.
     1 0.47     *Ii yo        nut     do ji       ku     nan gro            0        nde.
                I so NEG think CX)M I so meet 2so eye                       again    NEG
                I did not think that I would (ever) see you again.
   Example 1 0.47 is unacceptable on syntactic grounds. Negative sentences in Abun are
formed by two negative particles rather than only one. The dual negative particles that are
21    I n § 1 2. 1 i t i s shown that Abun prepositions not only link phrases to clauses but also link embedded
      clauses.
1 76                                                                                 CHAPTER 10used in Abun must bracket or enclose the entire verb phrase (in transformational grammar
terms) or predicate (in traditional grammar terms, meaning all the constituents that follow the
subject). Because of this, any subordinate clause that is under the matrix clause is always
included within the grammatical scope of the negation. This means that although it is the verb
of the matrix clause that is being negated, the final negative particle will not occur until after
the subordinate clause. The following example illustrates this, where the subordinate clause is
of the relative type, with the negative particle nde actually occurring after the relative clause
without negating the relative clause itself.
   l O.48    A n yo    ki     su-gato ibit subot nan          ma      nde.
             3PL NEG say thing-REL bad about           2so    exist NEG
             They did not say anything that was bad about you at all.
   In order for negative raising to take place as has been attempted in example l O.47 , only
one negative particle, -yo-, will move in order to negate the matrix verb nut 'think' . Due to
the structure and word order of complex negative constructions in Abun it is not possible to
shift the second negative particle nde and retain a grammatical sentence. Abun rules of word
order do not allow this. Normally in languages that allow negative raising the means of
negation is syntactically removed from the subordinate clause and 'raised' into the main
clause. Because Abun negation involves the use of two particles, both of these cannot be
'raised' from the complement clause. This structural limitation shows that negative raising is
not possible in Abun.
lO.3 EMBEDDED COMPLEMENTS
   The second type of complement to be found in Abun does not make use of the
complementiser. For want of a better label we have called these complements 'embedded' .
There are mainly two types of predicate which do not need to have a complementiser: those
which involve desiderative or attitudinal predicates and those which involve some type of
force, that is a manipulative predicate. These semantic distinctions are illustrated by the type
of verb suffix used. Attitudinal predicates make use of the suffix -wa, while those indicating
some sort of force or pressure (manipulative) use -gat. Examples of these verb types which
do not use a complementiser are fwa 'want' , bariwa 'not.want/dislike', nyuwa 'fear' and
nokwa 'worry about' , all being attitudinal predicates, and wergat 'persuade/pressurise' and
krokgat 'annoy/stir up' being manipulative predicates. Other manipulative predicates will be
discussed later in the chapter.
   The following examples illustrate these complement types:
   10.49     A n i-wa       ji     jam     mo an          sor.
             3so happy-TRS I so listen to         3so     only
             She wanted me to listen only to her.
   lO.50     An    bari-wa         an jam mo            ji.
             3so not.want-TRS 3so listen to             3so
             She did not want to listen to me.
   lO.5 1    Ii nok-wa       an maskwa ji.
             I so worry-TRs 3so angry        I so
             I was worried she (would be) angry (with) me.
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                                      1 77     1 0.52      A n krokgat ye         mwa maskwa yu.
                 3sG stir.up    people many angry        REFL
                 He stirred up many people (making them) angry with each other.
     1 0.53      Men yo      wergat ye-wis         Yi      ben-bot suk             re     nde.
                 I pL NEG force      PERs-kind other do-about thing                this   NEG
                 We do not force other tribes to do these things.
   In other languages, besides Abun, a different predicate type can mean a different
complement type. For instance Givan ( 1 990:553) states that it is ""more common to find
subordinating morphemes in complements of cognition-utterance verbs, as compared with
manipulative or modality verbs"". Givan' s categories roughly compare to the Abun
categories described above. All Abun utterance predicates use the complementiser (his
'subordinating morpheme' ) when the complement is intended to refer to direct spe�ch.22
His 'modality' predicates include the verb 'want' , which is under discussion here, and also
other verbs which are not in the class of verbs for Abun . 2 3 In English, attitudinal and
manipulative predicates are distinguished by having a complement of an infinitival structure.
Utterance predicates have complements which use a subordinating conjunction 'that'. Givan
further distinguished predicates (such as English 'want' and the manipulative predicate
'order') in that the infinitival complements of these verbs could not tolerate further embedded
clauses such as relative clauses and clefts ( 1 993:68). In Abun, these predicates likewise take
complements that are structurally quite different from the 'utterance predicates' and others
described in § 1O.2 above. The manipulative predicate ben 'make' , discussed later, does not
take a complementiser. A predicate such as let does not have a distinct lexical form in Abun
and is always rendered as fwa 'happy to' . Likewise the predicate oswa 'help' , although not
a desiderative predicate, makes use of the suffix -wa to indicate an embedded complement
clause. For example:
     10.54       Sane Markus os-wa duno an.
                 so   Markus help teach 3sG
                 So Markus helped to teach her.
   Besides not taking the complementiser do these complement types are structurally
different in another important way. These complement types function as the object of the
main clause. On the other hand those which use a complementiser do not, as was shown in
§ 10.2 .4 earlier. The complement clauses of § 10.2 were described as fitting into Abun
sentence structure in the following way:
              SUBJECT + VERB + (OBJECT) + (INDIRECT OBJECT) + (do) + (COMPLEMENT CLAUSE)
  The complement clause types under discussion here are structurally quite different. These
complement clauses function as the object and so the sentence has the following structure:
                                         SUBJECf + VERB + OBJECT
22    One predicate kendo 'call' does not use the complementiser if the complement does not represent
      direct speech. This distinction will be looked at further in § 10.3.3
23    These include 'start' , 'finish' and 'try' which are all adverbs in Abun, namely sim 'just started' or
      'finished/completely' bergan 'almost ' .
178                                                                                 CHAPTER 10   Earlier, example 1 0.40 above was shown in such a way that its constituent structure was
fully described. If example 1 0.49 is repeated in the same way the structural difference
between the complement types is clearer:
     10.55       An               twa          ji          jam     mo     an      sor.
       3sG              want         1 sG         listen to      3sG    only
       Subject          Verb                 Object (Complement Clause)
      She wanted me to only listen to her.
  What evidence is there to support this analysis that, when no complementiser is used the
complement clause is actually the object of the main clause rather than an additional
constituent within it? There are actually two points at issue here. Firstly, clauses like ji jam
mo an sor from example 10.55 above are actually full clauses and as such they are
complement clauses embedded in a larger structure, rather than being separate assertions.
Secondly, these clauses represent the object of the main clause in which they are embedded.
Each of these points will be looked at in tum.","[187, 188, 189, 190]"
"   A further clarification of negation in subordinate clauses is necessary in the case where a
relative clause in the object position is negated as well as the whole sentence. In such a case
only one nde is required, as in example 8 .30a. This particle fonns the bracket for both the
subordinate clause and the sentence. There are two occurrences of yo in 8.30a, whereas in
8.30b only the relative clause is negated, while in 8.30c the whole sentence is negated.
   8.30 a.      An    yo         git    roti    gato     yo       it     nde.
                3SG NEG       eat bread      REI..    NEG        rise    NEG
                He did not eat bread that was not risen.
           b. A n   git roti      gato yo               it      nde.
              3sG eat     bread REI..     NEG           rise    NEG
              He ate bread that was not risen.
           c.   An    yo      git       roti    gato      it     nde.
                3SG NEG       eat bread      REI..   rise         NEG
                He did not eat bread that was risen.
   A similar structure (with two occurrences of yo and one of nde) is used to indicate that a
particular action has never been done, as in example 8 . 3 1 . Both occurrences of yo are
preferred here because Musa does not eat fish and he has not ever done this. The second
occurrence of yo can be omitted, but Abun speakers tend to include it to reinforce the point
they are making - 'Musa doesn ' t eat fish, he never does' .
   8.3 1        Musa yo          git    boge   yo      rno      nde.
                Musa NEG eat       fish    NEG         exist    NEG
                Musa has never eaten fish.
   For further discussion of negation in subordinate clauses see § 10.2.5 and § 1 0.3 . 1 .2.
NEGATION                                                                                       1418.4 NEGATION IN WORDS   Abun is a language with very little affixation. As may be expected there are no affixes
used to negate words, as in the case of English, with words such as 'un-happy' and 'dislike ' .
However, there are a number o f verbs that are inherently negative in meaning such as:                   bari          do not want
                   bagri         do not want to eat
                   barnbrai      do not want to do something
                   bandof        do not feel comfortable with heights
                   bagwo         do not like being tickled
  Ba- could be analysed as a negative prefix, but the roots -ri, -gri, -brai, -ndof and
-gwo do not occur as free morphemes.
    These verbs remove the need for the use of the negative particles. Example 8.32a is a
negative indicative sentence. The use of an inherently negative verb (bariwa 'do not want to' ,
a s in example 8.32b), without the negative particles has the same meaning as the
corresponding positive verb used with the negative particles. The use of the inherently
negative verb with the negative particles makes the meaning a positive one, as in 8.32c.
   8.32 a.    Ji    yo       i-wa        ji      rn u    rno    nggwe nde.

"   The primary particle, nde, is used in all types of negation. Not only is it used as the
primary negation particle, but standing alone it simply means ' no ' . When a question is asked
and the response is negative, a simple nde is sufficient in reply. In contrast, the other negative
particle, yo, is used only in conjunction with nde. So it can be said that nde is indeed the
primary or basic negative particle.
  The particle nde is required to form prohibitive sentences, positive-negative alternative
questions and negative equational sentences (§8. 1 ).",[143]

6   Lyons ( 1 968 :3 1 7) noted that in some languages these concepts may merge into one another. In
    attempting to define the precise meaning of the predicate markers they can be loosely described a s
    falling into this broad area.

3.4.4 PROFORMS
   Abun has three subclasses of proforms                including      pronouns,      prosentences,     and
interrogative proforms.
    There is only one set of pronouns in Abun which is used for subject, object and possessor
and is listed in Table 3 . 1 4 below. There is significant dialectal variation, with the three main
dialects being distinguished by their first person singular pronoun. In addition to dual forms
trial and greater are possible. Thus me-ka-gri ' we three' or an-ka-at 'they four' are
frequently used in story telling.

                  non-human         i-
   In addition to the above pronouns, Abun has a reciprocal pronoun, yu, and two reflexive
forms, dakai and wadigan. These modify the appropriate pronoun above and yu. For further
details regarding the distinction between these two see §5.2. 1 . The same form of this
pronoun is used for all persons.
   The Abun prosentence subclass consists of one member, which i s also the pri mary
negation particle, nde. This word is used to answer questions with a 'no' and, as such, is
equivalent to a negative sentence. Affirmative answers use an echo system rather than a
prosentence (see §6. 1 for more details).
   There are three members of the interrogative proforms subclass, namely u 'which ' ,
suma 'what' and o t 'how many ' . These forms combine with other words to create
interrogative expressions such as, mo u 'ux: which: where' and kam ot 'day how .many:
when' . For more detail s see §6. 1 .4.","[55, 56, 57]"

7.2.4 DIFFERENCES BElWEEN MODAL PARTICLES
    Modal particles do not co-occur. To change from one to another results in a change of
degree of intensity. There is a progression of certainty from one particle to the next. When
mode is unmarked, nothing is indicated in the speaker' s attitude. When ya is used, the
speaker expresses the attitude that the proposition is possibly true; whereas bayok i s a Httle
stronger, that is probably true; while go asserts the truth of the proposition very strongly, that
is, as almost certain .

                                          NEGATION   Negation may take a variety of forms, such as 'negative verbs ' , negative particles or fully
bound deri vational morphemes (Payne 1 985b: 222). According to Payne, the use of negative
particles is the most likely form of negation, as is the case in Abun.","[141, 142, 143]"
"
10.3 . 1 .2 NEGATION OFCOMPLEX SENTENCES
   It has already been shown in regard to negative raising (§ 1 0.2.5) that a clause can be
shown to be subordinate by the placement of the negative particle nde. If a main clause is to
be negated, the negative particle nde occurs only after any subordinate clause which may be
embedded in that main clause. Example 10.57 (given earlier as 10.53) is an example of this
and has a manipulative verb (verb with -gat suffix) in the main clause.

                I PL NFG force      PERs-kind other do-about thing               this   NFG
                We do not force other tribes to do these things.
   Example 10.58 below shows the other type of verb under consideration here, verbs which
may take -wa suffix and where the pattern of negation is the same. The subordinate clause, in
these cases complement clauses which do not have a complementiser, is within the
grammatical scope of the main clause negation.
     10.58      Men yo      nyu-wa men mu k i              suk-du        re     nde.
                I PL NFG fear-TRs I PL go            say NOM-say         this   NFG
                We are not afraid to go and tell this story.
   The syntax of these examples indicates that these types of complement are in fact
subordinate because the final negative particle nde occurs after the complement. In order to
create two separate assertions in Abun, each clause would need to have both negative
particles in the correct positions, using a total of four particles in all rather than the two only
that are used in these examples. The presence and position of only two negative particles here
indicates that only one verb in the sentence has been negated, the verb of the main clause.
Therefore the second clause must be an embedded clause because the position of the second
negative particle nde indicates that this clause is included within the scope of the main clause
negation. Because there are only two negative particles there can be only one sentence here.
Therefore on the basis of the structure of the indicative negative, these complement clauses
are subordinate. 2 5
25     The placement of the final negative particle is also significant in another way. In the simple Abun
       clause only aspect particles or interrogative particles may follow the final negative particle.
       Therefore a constituent such as 'adjunct' may not follow after the negative particle. Thus the
       constituent structure given for these sentences cannot include an adjunct and is limited to the
       pattern SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECf .

   The purpose of the -wa suffix is to indicate that a part of speech, usually a verb that is not
normally transitive, is transitive in the utterance given. Therefore -wa changes the valency of
the verb from having only one argument to two. Usually -wa changes stative verbs into
transitive verbs and some of these, namely fwa 'want', bariwa 'do not want' and nyuwa 'be
afraid of' , are capable of taking the types of complements under discussion here. Any verb
which has the -wa suffix is transitive even if the object is not overtly stated. The following
examples indicate this:

             Don ' t fear.

4. 1 COREGRAMMAR ANDGRAMMATlCALRELATIONS
   The basic word order of an Abun clause, like all other West Papuan Phylum languages, is
SUBJECT VERB OBJECT.
   Firstly, in regard to subjects, Andrews ( 1 985: 1 04) points out that in a great many
languages a subject grammatical relation is clearly marked by the coding features of ordinary
main clauses. For example, in English, subjects are primari ly marked by the coding feature
of preverbal position, and in some limited cases indicated by case marking and cross­
referencing. Abun subjects are similar to English because they are clearly encoded by word
order. No case-marking or other coding devices signify an Abun subject. Rather, Abun
subjects are always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately precedes the
verb.
   The direct object in an Abun transitive clause is also encoded by word order alone. The
Abun object is always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately follows the
verb, except in certain contexts where the object can be fronted (see §4.7.2).
   According to Andrews ( 1 985:69), the first step in analysing the system of grammatical
relations in a language is to identify A, S, and 0, where A is transitive subject (prototypically
an agent), S is intransitive subject (either agent or patient) and 0 is transitive object
(prototypically a patient). Typologically languages differ according to how these grammatical
relations group. Nominative/accusative systems combine A and S functions, whereas
absolutive/ergative systems combine S and 0 functions.
   On this basis, Abun is a nominative-accusative language since it combines the S and A
functions. Abun combines S and A on a syntactic level, the syntactic coding being word
order. S and A precede the verb, whereas 0 follows the verb. In an intransitive clause, a
                                               48
ClAUSE STRUCTURE                                                                              49subject (S) precedes the verb, as in example 4. 1 . The same is true for a transitive clause, the
subject (A) precedes the verb and an object (0) fol lows, as in 4.2.
   4. 1        Men      kas.
               1 PL     run
               SUBJECf VffiB
               We ran .
   4.2         Men      gwa      Isak.
               1 PL     hit      Isak
               SUBJECf VffiB     OBJECf
               We hit Isak.
   Morphologicall y the constituents of noun phrases are the same, irrespective of the
grammatical role filled by the noun phrases. In example 4.2 the subject of the transitive
clause (A) is first person plural, while an identical form is also the object (0) of 4.3 and
subject of the intransitive c lause (S) in 4. 1 . All Abun pronouns are invariant in form, whether
they refer to the subject, object or possessor. See Table 3 . 1 4 in §3.4.4 for a ful l list of
pronouns.
   4.3         Isak      gwa     men.
               Isak      hit     1 PL
               SUBJECf VffiB     OBJECf
               Isak hit us.
   Most other grammatical relations, including that of dative, are encoded by the use of
prepositions. In addition to being encoded by prepositions, word order is stil l fairly rigid. For
example, dative, where present, follows an object and precedes other prepositional phrases .
Locative phrases with the preposition m o usually fol low a l l other prepositional phrases.
   Free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases which express time or location are free from the
otherwise rigid word order of the Abun clause, with the exception that they cannot occur
preceding the direct object (see §4.4. 1 ).
   Thus, an Abun main clause consists of:
          (ADJUNCTS) SUBJECf VERB (DIRECr OBJECf) (INDIRECr OBJECf) (ADJUNCTS) (PARTICLES)
   Adj uncts include free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases and various prepositional phrases
expressing associative, instrumental, benefactive and the like. The subject is obligatory and i s
rarely elided, even in subordinate clauses. Particles may optionally occur clause-finally to
indicate polarity, aspect, modality or mood. A detailed discussion of these particles is the
subject of the chapters 6, 7 and 8 of this work.
   Objects may be topicalised by fronting. Adj uncts expressing location or time may also be
fronted and thereby precede the subject in certain contexts (see §4.7 below). Those
expressing time usually precede the subject, whereas those expressing location are only
fronted on rare occasions.
50                                                                                            CHAPTER 44.2 ABUN AND lHE GRAMMATICAL RElATIONS HJERARON
   Blake ( 1 990: 1 ) summarises some of the basic notions of relational grammar and includes
a discussion of grammatical relations that can be arranged in a hierarchy, namely subject,
object, indirect object and obliques (that is, adjuncts). Each level of the hierarchy can be
distinctly marked; for example, the presence of case marking or adpositions tends to be
associated with the oblique end of the hierarchy.
   In arranging the grammatical relations of the Abun language in a hierarchy, it can be seen
that each level is marked in a distinct way, as listed in Table 3 . 1 8 below. First, the subject is
marked by word order; it is simply preverbal. Second, the object also is marked by word
order; it is postverbal. Next, at the level of indirect object, a change in marking takes place.
Higher in the hierarchy, word order alone marks the grammatical relations, but for indirect
objects and obliques grammatical relations are marked by prepositions, with word order
taking a secondary role.","[60, 61, 62]"
"   In example 8.35a, the garden falls within the scope of negation. Isak may not have been at
the garden. He may have done things elsewhere. In 8 .35b, the garden is outside the scope of
negation. It is contextually bound, since a construction of this nature occurs only when the
garden is being discussed. Information considered contextually free is bracketed by particles.
   In complex sentences it is clear how the scope of negation changes according to what is
bracketed. In example 8 . 36, when the bracketing changes from the whole sentence to the
complement, the meaning is significantly different.
   8.36 a.    Moses yo      ki     gado     do         an      kra         su    Barbarina 0       nde.
              Moses NEG say earlier that 3sG marry with Barbarina                         again    NEG
              Moses did not say earlier that he would marry Barbarina again.
         b. Moses ki gada        do     an yo     kra    su    Barbarina a                        nde.
            Moses say earlier that 3sG NEG marry with Barbarina again                             NEG
            Earlier Moses said that he would not marry Barbarina again.
     In a similar way the Chadic language, Hausa, syntactically marks the scope of negation by
the use of two negative particles. In that language these particles can move around to bracket
the subject, the predicate or other parts of the sentence. Examples are found in Schachter
( 1 985 :60). However word order is not rigid as it is in Abun. In Hausa, both particles can
move to bracket the constituent that is being negated and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope as well as the focus of negation. Abun ' s use of the linked particles is not as flexible:
because for example, the subject can never be surrounded by the linked pair of particles.
However the subject may be included in the scope of negation as discussed in the next
section.
1 44                                                                                       CHAPTER 8
8.5.2 NARROWINGlHE SCOPE OF NEGAll0N
   Example 8.33 above does not specify which of the components within the predicate are
being negated. Was it not a wild pig killed? Was it not a killing? Was it not at that location?
All of these components are within the scope of negation . To know which component is
being negated one needs to refer to the context of the discussion. Since negative sentences are
rarely said in isolation, that part which is being negated is usually known from the context.
   In English several strategies are used to narrow the scope of negation to the elements of
the sentence or predicate that the speaker wants to negate. These include the use of
phonological devices such as emphatic stress, or syntactic devices such as cleft constructions.
So, for example, the use of intonation to stress components of the sentence is a way to negate
a constituent as in, 'Isak did not eat the RICE (but the fish)' . Or, ' Isak did not EAT the rice
(but he just swallowed it) ' . Alternatively, or in addition, syntactic features may be used to
negate a constituent. Topicalisation, for example, is used in English, 'It was not the rice that
Isak ate ' .
   In the same way, Abun, like English, has some syntactic techniques that enable u s to
focus on the negation of a certain part of the sentence. Essentially the constituent to be
negated needs to be bracketed by yo and nde. In order to achieve this the predicate needs to
be transformed so that only one constituent is bracketed by the negative particles. As a result
of limiting the scope of negation, elements within the predicate are topicalised or relativised.
The scope can also be narrowed by a second use of the particle, yo.
   Firstly, by topicalising elements of the predicate the scope of negation is narrowed.
Topicalisation of an element removes such an element from the scope of negation, thereby
reducing the number of possibilities to which the negation may apply. So, for example, if the
wild pig in example 8 .37a, is topicalised, it becomes 8.37b, meaning that either the action
(killing) or the location fall within the scope of negation. If, then, the location is likewise
topicalised, as in 8.37c, the result is that either the action or the object falls within the scope of
negation. Also it is possible to front both the object and the location, thereby effectively
narrowing the scope of the negation to the action alone. Thus, in 8 .37d, the wild pig near the
Nai river is under discussion and Isak did not kill it; he must have done something else to it.
   8.37 a.     Isak yo      gu    nok         rno   syur    Na i de         nde.
               Isak NEG     kill wild.pig LOC water Nai           bank      NEG
               Isak did not kill a wild pig by the Nai river.
          b. Nok        ne    Isak yo      gu     rno syur Na i de                  nde.
             wild. pig DEf Isak NEG kill LOC water Nai bank                         NEG
             That wild pig Isak did not kill by the Nai river.
          c.   Mo    syur    Na i de        Isak yo        gu    nok         nde.
               LOC   water Nai bank Isak             NEG kill    wild.pig    NEG
               By the Nai river, Isak did not kill a wild pig.
          d. Nok       ga    rno syur Na i de            ne Isak yo           gu       nde.
             wild.pig REI... LOC water Nai bank DEf Isak NEG kill NEG
             (Concerning) a wild pig that was by the Nai river, Isak did not kil l (it).
   Secondly, in order to narrow the scope of negation to the modifier of a noun head of the
subject, the predicate of the sentence may be relativised to become embedded within the
subject position, with the modifier becoming the negated predicate. Take, for example, the
NEGATION                                                                                         1 45modifier of the head of the noun phrase, rnwa 'man y ' , in example 8 . 3 8a. Sentential negation
of 8.38a is shown in 8 . 3 8b. But to narrow the scope of negation to the constituent, rnwa, a
structural change is made to form 8.38c, where the item to be negated, rnwa alone is
bracketed by yo and nde. To achieve this, the predicate of 8.38b is relativised to become part
of the subject and rnwa then behaves as a predicate and can be negated with the linked pair of
negative particles, as in 8 .38c.
   8 . 3 8 a.   Pa         rnwa    it             rno   kelas gri.
                children  many go.up LOC grade three
                Many children went up to grade three.          b. Pa        rnwa     yo    it      rno kelas gri                    nde.
             children  many     NEG go.up LOC grade three                      NEG
             Many children did not go up to grade three.
          c.    Pa         ga     it        rno     kelas       gri     ne yo      rnwa   nde.
                children   who rise LOC grade        three              DEI' NEG
                                                                       many NEG
                The children who went up to grade three were not many.
   Finally, the scope can also be narrowed by the use of yo a second time in the sentence to
intensify or emphasise the negation thereof; compare example 8.39a to 8.39b, 8.39c and
8.39d. This second use of yo is limited to occasions when it precedes the verb rno 'to exist'
   8.39 a.      Men yo      ku      an    rno            nde.
                1 PL NEG meet 3sG exist                  NEG
                1 . We have not ever met him.
                2. We have never met him.
          b. Men ku       an yo       rno                nde.
             1 PL meet 3sG NEG exist                     NEG
             1 . We have met him, never.
             2. We have never met him.
          c.    Men yo      ku         an     nde.
                1 PL NEG   meet 3SG           NEG
                We have not met him.
          d. Men yo         ku      an yo       rno              nde.
                1 PL NEG meet 3sG NEG exist                      NEG
                1 . We have not met him, never.
                2. We have NEVER met him.
   In Abun the use of topicalisation, fronting and relativisation of predicates or part thereof,
or a second use of yo to narrow the scope of negation (to focus on or emphasise one
constituent of a sentence) is not very common. In most cases the constituent being negated is
understood from the context, obviating the need for such constructions.
                                           CHAPIER 9                                     RELATIVE CLAUSES
   In this section subordinate clauses of the type known as relative clauses will be discussed.
In Abun, relative clauses can be divided into the two basic types, restrictive and non­
restrictive. The restrictive type is by far the more common and more flexible grammatical
structure and so it will be discussed in more detail here. This discussion will attempt to show
that the Abun relative clause utilises a relative conjunction together with a strategy called a
gap strategy, in order to relati vise various grammatical relations.
   By using a different conjunction, a non-restrictive relative clause as well as a third type
which could be described as an indefinite relative clause are also possible in the Abun
language. These will be described in detail below.","[155, 156, 157, 158]"
"   Therefore, Abun is an isolating language, mostly monosyllabic. In the few cases of
affixation and word compounding that do occur, the morphemes are easily segmentable.
   The implications of very little affixation in Abun are that other strategies are required to
effect what is normally achieved through affixation. For example, in many languages
affixation on the head of a noun phrase defines grammatical relations. However, in Abun,
word order alone defines core grammatical relations, while prepositions are used with
obliques. Number is expressed with a classifier and a number word, rather than an affix.
Possession is not marked with an affix, but instead a linker is used between the possessor
and the possessum.
   Very little affixation occurs on Abun verbs. Instead of person/number agreement affixes
on verbs, only free form pronouns are used. While other languages in the West Papuan
Phylum have both free pronorrunal forms and person/number prefixes on verbs, including
the most closely related language, Maibrat, Abun does not. Time adverbs, temporal
prepositional phrases and some conjunctions indicate notions of time normally carried by
tense affixes. Polarity, aspect, mood and modality are conveyed by the use of particles, not
by affixation on verbs as is common in Papuan languages (Foley 1 986).
  The processes of word-building in Abun are therefore rather lirruted. The following
processes are evident: lirruted suffixation on verbs (§3 . 3 . 1 ) ; three prefixes for nouns (§3.3.2);
word compounding, principally in nouns (§3.3 .2); and some adjectives are used as manner
adverbs (§3.3.3 and §3.3 .4).",[36]
"   Payne ( 1 98Sb: 1 99) points out that subjects are usually context-bound and that contextually
bound elements are removed from the scope of negation. What is actually negated is the
contextually free part of the sentence. This, he says, """".often gives the i mpression that
sentential negation might better be described as 'VP negation ""'. Indeed, this is clearly the
case for Abun because the syntax makes that evident by the way the two particles bracket the
predicate (that is, the VP).
    Therefore when both particles are used, the scope of negation excludes the subject. When
we consider a situation where someone is discussing a hunting trip, one might say, 'Isak
killed a pig near the Nai river' . In order to negate this sentence, one would say, 'Isak did not
kill a pig near the Nai river' , as in example 8.33. In this example, the subject, Isak, is not
within the scope of negation because it is contextually bound; that is, Isak ' s actions were
under discussion. It is the relationship between Isak and the ki lling of a pig near the Nai river
that falls within the scope of the negation . The scope of negation when both particles are used
is the predicate, as is evidenced by the position of the two negative particles.
   So it is either the action (killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the Nai river)
that could be negated. All three of these fall within the scope of negation. The subject, Isak,
does not. Which constituent is actually being negated in the mind of the speaker would in
most cases be clear from the context.
   The shifting of words and phrases from outside to inside the bracketing of the linked pair
of negative particles illustrates that the two particles do in fact determine the scope of
negation. In example 8 .34, if kamdik-kamdik 'every day' is included within the bracket it is
also included within the scope of negation. If it is inside the bracket as in 8 . 34c, then the
frequency of eating fish is also negated. Therefore the meaning changes to ' I do not eat fish
every day' or 'Not every day I eat fish ' , implying that on some days fish is eaten, but not
every day. Example 8.34b has 'every day' outside of the bracket formed by the linked pair of
particles. In this way the action of eating, and the object, fish, are within the scope of
negation, but not the frequency. The temporal word in this case is outside of the scope
negation. In this way the two negative particles delineate the scope of negation, in the sense
that whatever falls between them falls within the scope of negation.

6. 1 .2 CONFlRMATIVE QUESTIO S
  This type of question asks for confirmation of a presumed situation. The structure is:
                                         (Ie) CLAusEfe
   Such constructions are very simi lar to yes/no questions, but they have a n SlTIg final
intonation contour and use the marker fe 'Confirmative Question Marker, CQM' sentence­
final ly, as in examples 6.4 and 6.5.
  6.4        Te    ji     bi     suk      ane     fe ?
             IQM I sG POSS thing          OEM     CQM
             That's mine ! Right?
   6.5       Ndo fe ?
             good CQM
             l . That's good! Right?
             2. That's good, isn't it?
   These questions presume a positive response and may also be called positively biased
yes/no questions. Negati vely biased yes/no questions, such as in example 6.6, are
unacceptable to an Abun speaker.
   6.6       *Ndar anane nde fe ?
             dog     OET       NEG CQM
             That's not a dog, right?
   Confirmative questions not only have a distinct FQM, but are also distinguished from
yes/no questions by a rising final intonation contour. Example 6.7 has the intonation pattern
as shown in Figure 6. 1 , which contrasts with the intonation pattern for the yes/no question of
6.8, shown in Fi gure 6.2 below.

6. 1 .3 ALTERNATIVE QUESTIONS
    In an alternative question, two or more possibilities are presented by the speaker.
Combinations include two possibilities such as, 'Do you want to go, or not?' , where the
alternative is a positive or negative reply; or 'Do you want a banana, or a coconut?' , where
the alternative is between two items. Another possibi lity is where one alternative is specified
and the second alternative seeks information such as, ""Is the palm wine sweet, or what?""
Also more extensive lists of alternative items are possible.
  For an alternative question where there are two alternatives, the structure is:
                                      (Ie) CLAUSE bado CLAUSE e
   Example 6.9 illustrates two alternatives:
MARKED MOODS                                                                                     105   6.9       A    kra    Moses bado a         bari             e?
             2sG marry Moses AQv1        2sG do.not.want Yl'QvI
             Do you want to marry Moses, or don ' t you want to?
   Instead of having a number of varied alternatives, a further possibility is to have just two
alternatives, one being the negation of the other. In these cases the first alternative (which is
positive) is followed by bado, while the second alternative is the negative particle, nde,
followed by the yes/no question marker, e. Thus the structure of a positive-negative
alternative question is:
                                      (te) CLAUSE bado nde e
   Example 6 . 1 0 illustrates this type of question.
   6. 10     Te men frot           an       bado, nde e ?
             IQM 1 PL     inform 3PL        NJ>1  NEG Yl'QvI
             Will we tell them or not?
  This form is often shortened by the ellipsis of nde e resulting in a form like that of yes/no
questions, but with a different FQM, that is bado. Such a form, as in example 6. 1 1 , is still a
positive/negative alternative question. It has the same meaning as if nde e was present.
   6. 1 1    A    jam    nadi, bado ?
             2sG know pray AQv1
             Do you know how to pray (or not)?
   This type of construction could be called a truncated positive-negative alternative question.
The addition of nde e makes the question more forceful and is used in cases where a
question, like that in example 6. 1 1 , is ignored or not answered quickly enough, so the
speaker would reiterate the question with nde e in addition to bado.
   A further variation of the type of alternative question is one where the final alternative
seeks information. The final clause follows the same structure as i nformation-seeking
questions, discussed in §6. 1 .4. Example 6 . 1 2 illustrates this type, where the last alternative is
actually an information-seeking question, and uses the particle ne as FQM.
   6. 1 2    Nau         ne   wik             bado sa            u        ne ?
             palm. wine DEI' good.tasting AQv1       like        which    FQM
             Does that palm wine taste good, or what?
   Regarding intonation in alternative questions, Abun has a falling final intonation contour
on bado in much the same way as intonation falls in yes/no questions as well as indicative
sentences.
   No matter what type of alternative question is asked, the syntax is the same, that is the
'Alternative Question Marker' (AQM), bado, fol lows each alternative. The final alternative is
followed by its relevant QM, usually the yes/no question marker, except for cases where it is
one seeking information. The 'Initial Question Marker' (IQM) is optionally present, as for
other question types. The structure of an alternative question (where n + 1 = the number of
alternatives) is:                                  [(te) CLAUSE bado ] n CLAUSE e
1 06                                                                                     CHAPTER 6
   In example 6. 1 3 there are four alternati ves. Each one, except the last, is fol lowed by bado.
This means that the clause which precedes it is in question as a possible alternative and every
clause in an alternative question must be followed by bado. The comma before bado and the
semicolon after it represent a pause and a longer pause respectively.
   6. 1 3    Be     nggon     gato    syimfar ne te           mu     ben suk    mo nggwe

             When a woman is pregnant does she also go to the garden, does she go on
             long trips too, does she carry heavy things too, or does she just stay at home
             and sweep the house?
6. 1 .4 lNFORMATION-SEEKING QUESTIONS
   Questions seeking information, such as those asking 'who ' , 'what ' , 'how ' , 'wh y ' , ' when '
and 'where ' , are all formed in Abun in a similar way. They follow the general bracketing
pattern that is evident in negation. A question of this type is formed by using two particles or
markers: te (always optional) at the start of the sentence and fQ\1 at the end. An interrogative
proform is also used in conjunction with these markers. This is a rare combination according
to Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 83), who say that inversion and special morphology
frequently co-occur with interrogative words, whereas particles and contrastive intonation do
not.
   The structure of information-seeking interrogative sentences in Abun is:
                                   (Ie) S v 0 ADJUNCT (Q) FQM
where FQM is a 'Final Question Marker' and (Q) represents a single interrogative word which
may fol low one of either the subject, the verb, the object or the adj uncts, depending upon
which constituent is being interrogated. Exceptions to this pattern occur when information
seeking-interrogative sentences are topicalised, as in example 6. 14. This pattern is discussed
in detail in §6. 1 .4.4.
   6.14      Ben sa         u       anato nan yo ma       more nde             ne ?
             do     like which FOC           2SG NEG come here NEG             FQM
             1 . How i s it that you didn 't come here?
             2. Why didn ' t you come here?
    Regarding the initial marker, te, in a sample of 194 questions in text material te occurred
4 1 times, that i s about 2 1 % of information-seeking questions use teo Therefore questions like
that in example 6. 1 5 are without the IQM and are more common than those with teo
   6.15      Ii    bi     suma is nan o ?
             l sG give what 10 2sG FQM
             1 . What can I give to you?
             2. How can I help you?
MARKED MOODS                                                                                       1 07   The final question marker (FQM) is either ne or o. The use of either one of these particles is
obligatory. The particles ne and 0 are used interchangeably, with no change in meaning. So
example 6. 16a has the same meaning as 6 . 1 6b. These two particles appear to have been
originally dialectal variants which have now been incorporated into all dialects. There is no
apparent difference in meaning; ne is more common than 0, occurring in 90% of all
questions analysed.
   6 . 1 6 a. Nan jan      suma ne ?
              2SG plant what fQM
              What did you plant?
            b. Nan jan      suma o ?
               2SG plant what fQM
               What did you plant?
  Both particles (te . . . ne/o) bracket the whole sentence irrespective of its complexity. In a
complex sentence as in example 6. 1 7, two clauses are embedded: a relative clause and a
dependent purpose clause. Both are bracketed by the initial and final particles.
   6. 1 7      Te ye         gato i        ne git suma sube             an   ge 6 ne ?
               IQM person REL sick DEY eat what so.that 3PL well again FQM
               1 . People who are sick eat what so they will get well again?
               2. What do sick people eat so they will get well again?
   Information-seeking questions have a final falling intonation contour similar to yes/no and
alternative questions. Such type of intonation is not what would be expected according to the
findings by U1tan ( 1 978:230), where he points out that information questions have a
considerably better-than-chance probability of having a rising terminal contour.
    The question word fol lows the constituent that is the focus of interrogation. In example
6. 1 8, the subject, that is 'the person who came ' , is the focus of interrogation; whereas in 6. 1 9
the object, that is 'the types of plants' , i s the focus of interrogation. I n 6.20 the location is the
focus of interrogation, and in 6.21 the indirect object is the focus of interrogation.
   6. 1 8     Te je        u     ma   more n e ?
              IQ'v1 person which come here FQM
              Who came here?
   6.19       Te    nan jan      suk-jan  u   ne ?
              IQ'v1 2sG plant NOM-plant which FQM
              Which plants did you plant?
   6.20       Nan grem buku ne          mo         u     ne ?
              2sG put     book OEM we              which FQM
              Where did you put the book?
   6.21       Te   an    syo buku n e nai je                      u         ne?
              IQM 3sG give book OEM 10     person                 which     FQM
              Who did he give the book to?
   With regard to the interrogative proforms used in information-seeking questions, Abun
has only three. According to Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985 : 1 84), theoretically it should be
possible that only one single morpheme, glossed as 'what ' , is needed. Therefore, all
108                                                                                  CHAPTER 6
information questions would involve periphrasis (that is, 'what person' for who, 'what place'
for where, and so on). However, in practice the smallest system known to them is the
Yokuts system with three interrogative words. Abun can therefore be added as one of the
smallest systems known. The three proforms are :              sum a          what               general interrogative
              u              which              specific interrogative
              ot             how many           pronumeral i nterrogative
  Table 6.2 shows each interrogative word and its periphrasis together with the equivalent
question words in English.
     Abun is even more unusual than Yokuts, not having a distinct interrogative proform that
makes a distinction between personal and impersonal ( ' who' and 'what' in English). Ultan
( 1 97 8:229) points out that this contrast is almost always present. But instead Abun forms the
pronominal interrogative, 'who ' , by a combination of je 'person ' and u 'which' .
   Each interrogative word with examples of various question types i s discussed below.

8.3 NEGATION IN SUBORDINATE ClAUSES   According to Payne ( 1 985b:240), in many languages the devices which are used for
negating subordinate clauses are different from those used in main clauses. He cites several
examples, including Yoruba, where the main clause negative particle is ko, while the particle
used to negate subordinate clauses is rna. In Abun most subordinate clauses are negated in
the same way as main clauses, the only exception being negative purpose subordinate
clauses, as in English 'lest' (or 'in order that.. .not' ).
   For example, in 8.26a the whole sentence is negated. By way of contrast, 8 . 26b illustrates
how the embedded clause itself may be negated, resulting in a different meaning. The same
pair of negative particles is used.
   8 .26 a.     Ii yo      me     Isak     ben suk       rn o    nggwe nde.
                l SG NEG    see    Isak   do     things LOC      gardenNEG
                I did not see Isak working at the garden.
         b. Ii       me    Isak yo         ben suk       rn o    nggwe    nde.
                l SG see   Isak   NEG     do    things   LOC     garden   NEG
                I saw Isak not working at the garden.
    Again, when the subordinate clause is indirect speech introduced by the subordinating
conjunction do, the negation of that clause uses the same pair of linked particles. In example
8 .27a the whole sentence is negated, whereas 8 .27b shows the negation of the subordinate
clause.

preposition kadit 'from' linking with the primary negative particle nde to bracket the
subordinate clause as illustrated in example 8.28.","[151, 152]"
"   Example 8 .6 has the same structure, but differs in meaning. It comes from a text where
the speaker is lecturing another about his relationship with his wife. He is not asking whether
the one addressed thinks about his wife, or not, as in a positive-negative alternative type of
question. Rather, he is using it as a rhetorical question with the meaning, ' You don't think
about your wife' ! The context makes it clear when a negative tag question is being asked or is
being used rhetorically.

  Negative yes/no interrogative structures such as, 'Are you not going?' are not used in
Abun. Instead the Abun speaker would formulate this type of question as, Nan mu e ? 'Are
you going?'","[145, 146]"
"
8.S 1HE SCOPEOF NEGATION
   Klima ( 1 964), Reesink ( 1986) and Payne ( 1 98Sb) discuss the scope of negation in terms
of 'constituent' and 'sentential ' . The negation of words or phrases may be called 'constituent
negation' , while the negation of predicates, sentences and more complex sentences has
traditionally been called 'sentential negation ' . These two terms were coined initially in relation
to English. In the sentence, 'John is unhappy' , the negation is defined as 'constituent'
because the negation operates on one part (or constituent) of the sentence; while in 'John is
not happy' , the type of negation is defined as 'sentential ' .
   I n Abun the scope o f negation i s usually sentential (or, more precisely, the negation o f the
predicate) and this is syntactically marked by use of the linked pair of negative particles
(§8.S . I ). Take, for example, the sentence in example 8.33, a simple negative indicative
sentence where the two negative particles surround the predicate. In this case, the action
(killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the Nai river) all fall within the scope of
negation. The subject (Isak), however, does not fall within the scope of negation here because
subjects are usually contextually bound.
142                                                                                      CHAPTER 8   8.33      Isak yo       gu     nok         mo   syur    Nai de         nde.
             Isak NEG      kill wild. pig LOC water Nai           bank    NEG
              Isak did not kill a wild pig by the Nai river.
   As to which constituent is actually being negated in the mind of the speaker would in most
cases be clear from the context, but there are syntactic strategies by which the scope of
negation can be narrowed to focus on one constituent. This is discussed in § 8 .S.2.","[153, 154]"

PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                                      209     1 2.2 1   Men YQ. ku    oto           wa men bes men b i                      suk        yo    mo      nde.

               We did not find any cars to carry our load (for us) at all.
   In example 1 2. 2 1 above, the main clause verb ku 'get' i s negated and the final negative
particle nde occurs after the embedded clause which is linked by the preposition wa 'for'. In
example 1 2.22 below, the means of clause linkage is the compounding conjunction w e
'because' . The negative particles have been placed i n exactly the same way as i n 1 2.2 1 above,
yet this is an unacceptable sentence.
     1 2.22    *Ii    YQ.   ma    we       ji    bi     nggon                      i         nde.
               I so   NEG come because I so POss woman                             sick      NEG
               I did not come because my wife was sick.
   Example 1 2 .22 above i s structurally incorrect because, when clauses are linked by a
compounding conjunction such as we 'because' , each clause must be individually marked
for negation if negation is relevant. In example 1 2.23 below only the verb of the first clause,
ma 'come ' , is negated. The second negative particle nde occurs before the conjunction w e
indicating that the second clause i s not a subordinate clause.
     1 2.23    Ii     YQ.    ma       nde    we          ji     bi         nggon        l.
               I so   NEG come NEG because I so POss woman sick
               I did not come because my wife was sick.
   When clauses are linked by compounding conjunctions they cannot be embedded, as i s
the case when clauses are linked b y prepositions. I n these cases each clause must be marked
for negation and for mood, if this is applicable. Each clause could stand as an independent
clause. Therefore the sentence which uses a compounding conj unction as the means of clause
linkage is structurally different to those which use prepositions. The following examples
indicate the mood and negative marking of clauses linked by these conjunctions. 39

"
8.2.6 1HE INTERACTION OF yo AND nde
    In summary, the negation of a sentence with just the primary particle nde means that one
is not allowed or prohibited to do a particular thing, as in example 8 .25b. In contrast to this,
the addition of the secondary negative particle (or predicate marker) yo changes the nature of
the sentence to become simply a negative indicative statement, as in 8.25c.
   8.25 a. An ma.
           3sG come
           He came.
NEGATION                                                                                           139           b. An    rna  nde.
                3sG come NEG
                He cannot come.
           c.   An    yo    rna     nde.
                3sG   NEG come NEG
                He did not come.
   The use o f nde alone implies that there is something that prevents the person doing
something or makes it impossible for the person to do something, as in the example, 'He
cannot come ' . We do not actually know why he cannot come. But when the speaker simply
wants to make an indicative statement that he has not or did not come, then the additional
particle yo makes that clear. That is, there was nothing preventing the person from coming,
they just have not come.","[150, 151]"
"
10.2.5.1 LEXICAL RESTRICTIONS
   The limitation of the predicate types which allow negative raIsmg involve further
restrictions for Abun. Abun, in common with the languages of the Papuan region, does not
have a wide range of single morpheme vocabulary to indicate states of mind. The verbs
'know ' , 'understand' , 'hear' and 'believe' may all be expressed by the one verb jam. The
verb 'believe', which may allow negative raising in some languages, does not exist as a
separate lexicon entry in Abun. Another candidate for negative raising is the verb 'want' . The
process of negative raising changes a matrix clause verb 'want' to the negative 'do not want' .
Although it is possible to change the Abun verb lwa 'want' to yo lwa nde 'not want' , the
more usual practice is to use the inherently negative word barilbariwa 'not want' . Because it
is more common for Abun speakers to use bari rather than yo lwa nde, the possibility of
negative raising does not arise due to the choice of negative strategy taken, namely a negative
word rather than a negative particle.",[187]
"
8. 1 .2 POSlTIVE-NEGATIVE ALlERNATIVE QUESTIONS
  The primary negative particle is also used in asking positive-negative alternative questions.
The structure of this type is:                                      S PRED badu nde e?
   These questions could be called negative tag questions with a positive-negative alternative,
'Do you want to go back to your wife, or not?' , as in example 8 . 5 where a person is being
asked to make a decision between positive and negative alternatives.
   8.5        Nan satu        mo     nan   bi       nggon   bado, nde    e?
              2SG go.back LOC 2SG POSS woman AQ.1                  NED   Yl'Q\1
              Do you want to go back to your wife, or not?",[145]

9.5.2 ABUN RELATIVEClAUSES ANDTHE ACCESSIBILITY H1ERARCHY
   Keenan and Comrie ( 1 977) in their work on relative clauses devised a hierarchy they
called the Accessibility Hierarchy which summarised their findings across a wide sample of
languages. They had investigated the types of constraints across languages on which
grammatical relations could be relativised. Comrie ( 1 989: 1 56) later refined this hierarchy so
that ""The hierarchy subject > direct object > non-direct object > possessor defines ease of
accessibility to relative clause formation"". He stated that ( 1 989: 1 56): ""if a language can form
relative clauses on a given position on the hierarchy, it can also form relative clauses on all
positions higher (to the left) on the hierarchy"".
   How do Abun relative clauses compare to this hierarchy? Does this hierarchy hold true
for Abun? In §9.5 . 1 above, several examples were given which showed that various
positions along the hierarchy could be relativised. In fact in Abun all positions on Comrie's
Accessibility Hierarchy can be relativised.
   Keenan ( 1 985 : 1 56), when referring to the different strategies that a language may use to
form relative clauses, noted that ""pronoun retaining strategies are (a) more effective means of
forming RCS (restrictive relative clauses) than RPRO (relative pronoun) or gapping strategies"",14   Probably the formula should contain ± OBJECT, but n o examples with a n object occur i n the corpus
     of data.
15   It i s our experience i n living among Abun speakers that such errors that Giv6n imagines rarely arise.
     Because word order is the main means of encoding grammatical relations, there are very strong
     internal expectations in the mind of the hearer. These expectations are not necessary for languages
     which use case marking or affixation for deriving meaning. The device of the boundary marker is
     strongly used throughout Abun grammar to assist hearers in encoding meaning. It is used in
     negative constructions and in interrogatives. Here, also, the dual particles involved could be
     considered as 'bracketing' devices. These are discussed more fully Chapters 6 and 8.
156                                                                                                 CHAPTER 9since he considered that more positions along the hierarchy could be relativised when the
pronoun was retained. Although Abun does not use a pronoun-retaining strategy, but a gap
strategy, this does not prevent a wide range of positions being relativised. There do not
appear to be restrictions on relative clause formation in Abun. However the last level of the
hierarchy, that of 'possessor', has limited formation possibilities in Abun . Examples 9.30 to
9.37 below illustrate the formation of relative clauses at different levels along the
Accessibility Hierarchy.","[167, 168]"
"
5.7.2 DISJUNCTION
   According to Payne ( 1 985a:40), the majority of languages appear to possess at least one
unequivocal strategy for disjunction, and this is invariably permitted at sentential and phrasal
levels. This is true in Abun. The basic structure for disjunction is for the speaker to fol low
each phrase or sentence with the word, bado. In Abun, disjunct phrases consist of: NP bado NP
bado and so on. The form bado is the alternative conjunction.
     Examples of the use of bado from sentence to phrase level are:(i) Sentence:
     5 . 1 86   Pa    yo    ki    nai    bado   Ester rnu      rno     Barbarina     ete
                child DEY   say   to     or     Ester go       LOC     Barbarina     and.then
                rna     bado ...
                come or
                A child told (them) or Ester went to Barbarina and came (with the answer) ...
PHRASE SlRUCfURE                                                                             99(ii) Prepositional Phrase:
   5 . 1 87   Pa    ne     rno nu        bado rno nggwe bado.
              child DEf LOC house or             LOC garden or
              The child is at home or in the garden.(iii) Possessive Phrase:
   5 . 1 88   Barbarina titi     rnu   kern    rno    gato Yulius b i        nu      ne     ti
              Barbarina flee     go    stay    LOC    RH.. Yulius poss       house   DEf    sea

              or      Obet POSS house o w n or
              Barbarina fled and stayed at Yulius' house at the sea or Obet' s house...(iv) Noun Phrases:
   5 . 1 89   An    so     pa      re     tepsu jot bado        kokor     bado.
              3SG sell child this like            pIg or        chicken   or
              He sold the child like a pig or a chicken.
   5 . 1 90   Erensi nai      rnbre toba      re     sak         w e bado     sak
              Erensi took     cloth toba      this   handspan    two or       handspan
              gri   bado sak            at     bado.
              three or      hands pan four or
              Erensi took the toba cloth, (it was) two or three or four handspans.
    Payne ( l 985a:40) also points out that in certain environments the distinction between
'and' and 'or' (when the latter is indifferent in the choice between the elements) may be a
minimal one. For example, in example 5 . 1 74 above, an alternative translation would be, 'Eat
animals such as wild pigs (or), kangaroos (or), tree kangaroos or the like ' . Likewise, there is
some merging of 'and' and 'or' in examples 5 . 1 65 and 5 . 175. On the other hand, examples
5. 1 73 and 5 . 1 85 may not be translated as 'or' , but must only be 'and' .
  Juxtaposition is sometimes used as an alternative to bado. It is particularly evident when
quantifiers are used in noun phrases, such as in example 5. 1 9 1 .
   5.191      rnbre dik y o w e yo
              cloth one a two a
              one or two cloths
   Other alternatives to bado, that are frequently used as alternative conjunctions in spoken
Abun, are ke and ka. These come from Biak and Indonesian respectively, the latter being a
corruption of the yes/no question particle, kah. This has come about because bado is used in
asking alternative or tag questions, as in 'An rna, bado, (nde e) ?' 'He has corne or (not)?'
Frequently nde e is omitted, so the alternative conjunction may also act like a yes/no
interrogative particle. Thus Abun speakers have adopted the Indonesian, kah, and use that
just as they use their own, bado; that is, as an alternative conjunction and in alternative
questions, even though in Indonesian kah is only a yes/no question marker and not an
alternative conj unction. The alternative conjunction in Indonesian is atau, which also is
sometimes borrowed by Abun speakers. Examples are:
1 00                                                                              CHAPTER S

                                           CHAPTER6
                                     MARKED MOODS    There are three moods which are marked in Abun, namely interrogative, i mperative and
frustrated action. Mood is marked by a clause-final particle which fol lows other particles (that
is, those that mark negation, aspect and modality). Each marked mood will be discussed in
tum.
6. 1 lNTERROGATIVE MOOD
   Interrogative mood, like other moods in Abun, uses particles. Two particles are used to
bracket or delineate the constituent being interrogated. The pattern of bracketing a
grammatical constituent by particles is a feature of the Abun language. It is used in negation
(see §8 .2), and also in relative clauses, both restricted and unrestricted, as discussed in §9.
  The basic structure of an interrogative sentence in Abun is:
                                        IQM clause FQM
   The optional particle te (referred to as IQM 'Initial Question Marker' ) and another particle
called FQM 'Final Question Marker' bracket the clause in question. For all question types te is
the IQM, but the particle FQM varies according to the type of question being asked.
   The initial particle te, although now apparently totally optional, may well have been an
obligatory part of interrogative structures in the past, before the influence of the national
language, Indonesian. This is borne out by the fact that those less influenced by the national
language, from interior villages, use te much more than those on the coast, where the effects
of the national language are more prevalent.
  As a general rule, the pattern of intonation in interrogative sentences is a final falling
contour. The exception is confirmative questions which have a final rising intonation.
   All interrogatives are seeking some type of information. On lexical grounds, namely the
variation in the FQM particle, it is apparent that Abun has four basic types of interrogatives.
The four types are the:
   •   YES/NO (or NEXUS) question, one that seeks a comment on the truth of a proposition;
   •   CONFIRMATfYE question, that seeks agreement, or confirmation from the addressee;
   •   ALTERNATIVE question, which provides a list of possibilities from which the
       addressee selects an answer;
   •   INFORMATION or QUESTION WORD question, which seeks particular information such
       as 'who ' , ' what ' , ' how ' , 'why ' , ' when' and 'where ' .","[110, 111, 112, 113]"
"8.5 . 1 THE SCOPE WffiI BOTII NEGATIVE PARTIClES
   The scope of negation is readily determined by the use of the linked pair of negative
particles, yo and nde. These two particles bracket the predicate, making the scope of negation
syntactically evident. In Abun the scope of negation, when the linked pair of negative
particles is used, is always encoded as a predicate since the linked particles always and only
bracket a predicate. The subject can never be bracketed by the two negative particles.",[154]
"   The secondary particle yo is used in conjunction with the primary particle in the formation
of the following sentence types: negative indicative sentences, negative information-seeking
interrogati ves, negative descriptive sentences, negative location sentences. It is also used in
the negation of subordinate clauses (§8.2).
   Placement of the negative particles when they occur is invariant: yo always precedes the
predicate, while nde always follows the predicate. The following example illustrates negation
of a simple indicative sentence, where both yo and nde are obligatory:
   8 . 1 a.   An    ma      mo    nu.
              3PL come LOC house
              They came to the house.
         b.   An    yo    ma      mo    nu        nde.
              3PL NEG come LOC house              NEG
              They did not come to the house.",[143]
"
3.4.5 PARTICLES
  There are several subclasses of particles including a topicaliser particle, a particle used for
negation, three aspect, three modal and eight mood particles. The term particle is used to
mean a free form word that does not take any type of inflection. It is an invariant form that
never occurs in an environment where i t could be described as 'bound' .
   The topicaliser or focus particle is ana(to), which always occurs after the subject and
before the verb. See §4.7.2 for more details about the use of this particle.
   There is one negative particle, nde, which occurs after the predicate and before aspect
mood or modal particles. Used on its own it may answer a question in the negative. To form
the indicative negative this particle along with the predicate marker yo form a linked pair of
particles. These particles jointly bracket the constituent 'predicate' . Used in a sentence without
yo, nde makes the mood of the sentence prohibitive. For further details see §8.
   If a clause includes aspect, modal or mood particles, those particles will always be in
clause-final position in that order. The particles may occur after either the verb, the object, the
indirect object or an adjunct, depending on the constituents of the particular clause concerned.
Also, these particles are not clitics in that the particle takes equivalent phonological stress
along with every other word in the clause.

   There i s a limited number of particles which some writers refer to as 'modality ' rather
than as aspect (Foley 1 986: 1 5 2ff.). In Abun, three modal particles are used. These are listed
in Table 3 . 1 6 below and are discussed in more detail in §7.2.","[57, 58]"
"8.2 THE USE OFyo   The negative particle y o is used in negative indicative sentences, i nformation-seeking
interrogative sentences, negative descriptive and location sentences and in the negation of
complex sentences. It is never used to negate a sentence by itself, but is always linked with
the primary negative particle nde. These two particles form a linked pair that bracket the
predicate of the sentence. The particle yo always occurs between a subject and predicate. The
word order is rigid.",[147]
"     The use of linked pairs of negative particles is uncommon. However French is a well­
documented example of the use of a linked pair of negative particles, for example, j e
n e. . . suis pas. The first particle n e is the primary particle and then pas i s added. Payne
( 1 985b:224) claims that in the case where such linked pairs of negative particles do occur, the
second particle occurs because there is a strong tendency for a single negative particle to be
reinforced and emphasised by the addition of a second particle. Payne analyses pas as the
added particle that reinforces the negation in French.
   By way of contrast, Abun places the primary particle after the predicate, not before as in
French. Also the operation of the secondary particle in Abun is not so much to reinforce the
negation of a sentence as Payne claims of French, but rather to mark the predicate and thus
delineate the scope of negation.",[147]
"
8.2.2 NEGATIVE INFORMATION-SEEKING INrERROGATIVES
   In contrast to positive-negative alternative questions, negative interrogative sentences
seeking information require both negative particles, yo and nde, such as in the following
examples:   8. 1 5 a.    Te     nan     rna     wa      surna ne ?
                IQM    2sGcome for             what    fQv1
                Why have you come?
          b.    Te     nan yo          rna       nde     wa     surna ne ?
                IQM    2SG NEG      come         NEG     for    what         fQv1
                Why didn ' t you come?
   8 . 1 6 a.   Je        u          ana rna       ne?
                person what TOP           come     FQM
                Who has come?
          b. Je      u       ana yo                rna        nde     ne ?
             person which TOP NEG                  come NEG           fQv1
             Who has not come?
     Take note that the interrogative mood also has two bracketing particles, te the initial
question marker and ne the final question marker. The bracketing required to negate a clause
falls within the bracketing required to form an interrogative construction, as seen in example
8 . 1 5b.",[148]
"
37     Examples of these are in §9.3.
PREPOSmONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCflONS                                                                    205   1 2.3     Yenggras Cosmus           brek     kwem         su       mu       nden      mo tanjung

             Kasuwari        wa    men sem           mone.
             Cassowary for I PL sleep there
             Mister Cosmus turned the head of the canoe towards the shore at Cassowary
             Point in order for us to sleep there.
   Since wa i s a preposition, if a clause containing wa is negated the prepositional phrase is
included within the negation. For example:
   1 2.4     Yenggras       )!Q   ki         nggon      yo          wa        ji      nde.
             elders      NEG say women DEr.(J) for IsG NEG
             The elders did not speak to any women for me (to marry).
   Likewise if wa links a constituent that is as large as a clause, this clause i s also included
within the scope of the negation of the main clause verb. Example 1 2.5 below illustrates this:
   1 2.5     Men )!Q        ku    oto        wa men bes           men bi           suk       yo     mo
             I PL NEG find car for I PL lift           I PL poss thing                       NEG    exist
             We did not find any cars to carry our load (for us) at all.
   In § 1 0.2.5 earlier it was shown how a clause can be considered as subordinate by the
placement of the final negative particle nde. If a main clause is to be negated, the negative
particle nde only occurs after any subordinate clause which may be embedded within the
larger sentence. Thus clauses joined by wa are embedded clauses within a l arger sentence. So
in example 1 2.5 above the preposition wa is used to link the clause men bes men bi suk ' we
load our things' to a larger sentence. The placement of the negative particle nde as sentence­
final indicates that this clause is in fact embedded.
   The following example i s even more complex. The verb of the main clause is negative
and, as is the case with main clause verbs in Abun, the second negative particle cannot occur
until after any embedded clauses which are governed by the main clause. In this example
there are three embedded clauses, one a relative clause and two that are embedded by means
of wa, showing that wa is also recursive in nature. To add to the complexity the main clause
is also an interrogative. Again, like the final negative particle, the interrogative marker e
occurs after the embedded clauses.

(v) sudelsu-bere 'so that'
   This conjunction is made up of the prepOSItIon su 'with' and the time word bere
'FUTUREflater' . As regards the dialect variant sude, no meaning component has been elicited
for -de. Speakers that use sude often add bere indicating that this conjunction is used with
events not yet realised. Sude is not used to link a noun phrase to a clause, so in this way it
could not be described as a preposition. However, it is the authors' opinion that the form
sude is derived from the preposition su 'with ' and so it has been included here with other
preposi tions.

              If you find some ginger root then keep it (here) so that I can go and get Sem
              soon (so that he can use the ginger root).
   In a language like English, adverbial subordinate clauses can be distinguished from
coordinate clauses in that the subordinate clause is not fixed in its position within the
sentence. The subordinate clause may be either pre-posed, that is sentence-initial, or post­
posed, that is sentence-final. Such flexibility of sentence position is not possible in Abun.
Therefore in Abun, the ability to pre-pose or post-pose an adverbial clause is not an indicator
of subordination. As has already been discussed earlier (§ 1O.3. 1 . 1 ) , there is no non-finite
verb form that can be used to signify that a clause is subordinate. However, the placement of
the final negative particle is an indicator in Abun that a clause is embedded within a larger
sentence. By this means clauses that are linked to larger clauses by prepositions can be
shown to be subordinate, as in examples 1 2.5 and 12.6 above. However, prepositions and all
conjunctions in Abun are sentence-medial. A clause together with its linking conjunction
cannot be fronted or pre-posed as is possible in a language like English. It has been claimed
(Givon 1 990: 844) that ""All languages seem to allow the pre-posing of ADv-clauses"". This is
not the case for Abun and therefore this cannot be used as an indicator of subordination.","[216, 217, 218, 219]"

   In Abun, the constituent termed mood is an element of the clause expressed through the
means of a clause-final particle. The indicative mood is unmarked. One interesting feature of
the mood particles is the use of two particles as a linked pair to indicate interrogation. In a
simi lar way, negation of indicative sentences uses a linked pair of particles. In Abun, the
strategy of using two particles (as opposed to one) is for the purpose of delineating
constituent boundaries. Thus the constituent 'interrogative' is marked by two particles, one
termed the initial question marker (IQM), occurring clause-initially and the other, the final
question marker (FQM), which ends or closes the interrogative. In modem usage the initial
question marker te appears to be optional, perhaps influenced by the national language,
Indonesian, which does not possess such a particle. The FQM differs according to the type of
interrogati ve.
   A table of the eight mood particles is listed below. For further information about mood
particles listed here see §6.

3 .4.6 INTERJECTIONS
   There are several interjections in Abun, such as mban! 'expression of surprise/alarm' (for
example, when a coconut falls nearby); mara! 'expression of disgust' (for example, when
someone doubts the integrity of another person, this interjection would begin a defence); and
bei! 'expression of surprise ' . According to Schachter ( 1 985: 58), ""The class of interjections
often includes words which are phonologically distinctive"". However, in contrast to this,
those interjections observed so far fit within the regular phonological patterns of the language.
                                           CHAPTER 4
                                   CLAUSE STRUCTURE   The focus of thjs chapter is the structure of an Abun main clause. Firstly, some comments
are made about the core grammar and grammatical relations (§4. 1 ) followed by a note on
how the grammatical relations hierarchy relates to Abun (§4.2). A discussion of clause types
(§4.3), peripheral constituents, which are labelled here adjuncts (§4.4), and clause-final
particles (§4.S) completes the picture of the Abun verbal main clause. In §4.6, Abun verbless
clauses are djscussed.
   A feature of Abun clauses is their fairly rigid word order, especially in the core, but also in
the periphery. The acceptable variations are limited. There are several syntactic information­
packaging options in Abun clauses such as de-focusing, topicalisation and cleft-like
constructions, which are discussed in §4.7.","[58, 59, 60]"
"
8 . 1 THE USE OF nde   As indicated earlier, the simplest negative sentence is just the negative reply to a question,
'Nde ' . In this section, types of negative structures that require the use of nde without yo are
discussed. These types of structure are: prohibitive sentences, positive-negative alternative
questions, and negative equational sentences.",[144]
"   There are two patterns o f negation found in Abun a s follows:                                          S PRED nde
                                         syo PRED nde
   They are unusual and have been documented in only a few languages. In SVo languages
the negative particle normal ly precedes the verb (Payne 1985b:224). One would expect the
particle nde to be preverbal, but instead, in Abun, it is not only postverbal but also postobject
and adjunct. This pattern type, though uncommon, is also found in a few documented
languages such as Bolewa, Ngizim, Angas, Ron, Gisiga, Higi and Tera (Payne 1 985b:226).
   Furthermore the second pattern type, where a pair of linked negative particles occur, is
also uncommon. In French a linked pair of particles is used in negation, but this pair brackets
only the verb and its associated clitics, whereas in Abun the linked pair brackets the whole
predicate including object and adjuncts. However, this pattern type is an attested one in some
Chadic languages such as Hausa, Jegu and Sura (Payne 1 985b: 225-226). The difference
with these languages is that their word order is not rigid as in Abun. In Hausa both particles
can move to bracket the constituent that is to be negated, and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope and focus of negation (Schachter 1985:60).",[144]
"
32   It may appear confusing to use Foley' s definition of the terms REA LIS and IRREALIS since these terms
     are often used to describe not tense, but mood (for example see Giv6n 1 984:255). However,
     Foley's term 'status' which he divides further into 'realis' and 'irrealis' closely approximates the
     semantic distinction between the two postpositional conjunctions sa and yo .
1 94                                                                                      CHAPTER 1 11 1 .2. 1 THE REALIS CONJUNCTION sa
   When a language indicates the temporal setting of events expressed within clauses it may
do so by a formal grammatical category tense, by time words or a combination of both
strategies. In regard to complex sentences, tense as a category may be marked within the
component clauses and particular conjunctions may convey particular 'marked' time
meanings, such as 'before ' , 'after' , 'as ' , and 'while' . The Abun conjunction sa carries the
grammatical information of 'realis', but in relation to specific time concepts is unmarked.
Thus it could be considered a general time subordinator and translated into English as
'when.REALIS' . Sa indicates that the clauses it joins are in realis time setting. By usage of sa
hearers know that the connected events expressed by the clauses are in the past, that they
have already occurred. When clauses are joined by sa, speakers usually pause after sa,
indicating that sa is considered to be part of the preceding clause. Nevertheless sa is still a
conjunction or means of joining two clauses in Abun. It is not possible to end a sentence
with sa. Therefore clauses marked by sa are dependent temporal clauses in the same way as
the English 'when' clause. Sa i s a sentence-medial subordinating conj unction and i s a
constituent of the first clause of a complex sentence which has the following structure:
                                      [CLAUSE 1 + sa] + CLAUSE 2
   The following examples are typical of the way sa is used in Abun:
   1 1 .3     Men kern rno        karnpung     sa            Rahel     hi     ai     farkor an.
              I PL stay i n    village      when.REAL Rachel poss father teach                 3sG
              When we stayed in the village, Rachel ' s father taught her.
   1 1 .4    Mensern rnonekret             Marten sa                Marten rna      karn Selasa.
              I PL sleep there wait.for Marten when.REAL Marten come                day     Tuesday
              We slept there, waiting for Marten and he came on Tuesday.
   As a general time subordinator the range of meanings conveyed by sa is wide. Sa is a
temporal link between clauses and as such can be used to indicate the following range of
meanings:
                  ( 1 ) precedence            whenlbefore

                  (3) simultaneity            when/while
                  (4) point coincidence       when/as/, just then
   Giv6n describes a general subordinator such as sa as being semantically ' less marked' .
Conj unctions such as 'before ' , ' after' , 'while' and the like are considered to indicate 'specific
temporal relations' . Therefore Giv6n ( 1 990:828) considers that ""Such less-marked coding
strategy is successful when the semantic specificity of the temporal relation can be inferred
from other features of the two clauses - most commonly from the verb and its tense-aspect.""
Since in Abun the conjunction itself indicates the 'tense' or time setting, it is not necessary to
use other means in order to indicate the specific temporal relation concerned. In the examples
below the extent of temporal relations that sa can convey is shown together with more
specific means of indicating these.

               1 . When I came he had not yet arrived.
               2. By the time I came he had not yet arrived.
   The above examples indicate temporal precedence, which in many languages is indicated
by a specific time word meaning 'before ' . Abun has no single word which can be translated
as 'before ' . Instead the negative particle nde combined with the incompletive aspect particle
to are used to indicate 'not yet'. In the above examples there are two further means of
inferring the time relation in addition to the conjunction itself. Example 1 1 .5 has the second
clause marked by the perfect aspect particle) 3 In example 1 1 .6 the temporal precedence
relation is more explicitly marked by nde to 'not yetlbefore' again on the second clause.
These particles may behave as a conjunction without the need for the general subordinator sa.
If used in a clause within a complex sentence nde to has the specific meaning of 'before ' .
For example:
     1 1 .7    Tepsu         gane j i   yo fa i  Apner nde to,   Apner                      dam

               1 . At that time before I knew Apner, he did not know me either.
               2. At that time I did not yet know Apner, he did not know me either.","[205, 206, 207]"
"     Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985: 175) note that a striking feature of negative imperatives is how
differently they are handled from negative declaratives. They say it is quite unusual for the
marks of negation from other sentence types to be added to the imperative formula. Abun
actually takes one of its negative particles used in declarative sentence types and uses it for
making negative imperatives. Negation in declarative sentences is marked by a linked pair of
particles, yo... nde, whereas for negative imperatives nde alone is used. Compare 6.8 1 a with
6 . 8 1b.

5 . 1 VERB PHRASFS
   For the purposes of this discussion we shall define a verb phrase not as a total predicate,
but limited to the verb and its modifiers, as discussed by Schachter ( 1 985:4 1 ). In Abun, verb
phrases are defined as consisting of a verb as head, with optional predicate markers and
verbal particles.
   Auxiliaries, which carry notions of tense, aspect, mood, modality, polarity and voice, are
not considered as part of the Abun verb phrase since they are separated from the verb, not
only by any object, but also by any adverbs and adjuncts in the sentence. Aspect, mood,
polarity and modality particles can be contiguous with the verb only when there are no
object(s), adverbs or adjuncts. Therefore, for Abun, such particles are not analysed here as
part of the verb phrase, but are considered separately because they operate on the clause level.
They are discussed separately in §6, §7, and §8.

     Thus an Abun verb phrase consists of:                          (PREDICATE MARKER) VERB* (VERBAL PARTICLE)
               (*a direct object, where present, occurs between its verb and the verbal particle)    One of the two modifying components is a predicate marker particle. There are four
predicate marker particles which when present always directly precede the verb. They are
listed in Table 5.2 below:                                      TABLE 5.2: PREDlCATE MARKERS               Particle                                  Meaning

6.1 .4.4 TOPICAUSATION OF INFORMATION-SEEKlNG QUESTIONS
   Information-seeking questions, like indicative sentences, can be topicalised (see §4.7.2). In
these forms the question word is followed by the demonstrative-focus word (or topicaliser),
anato, as in example 6.54. The use of this form brings sukjan 'plants' into greater focus or
emphasis than the non-topicalised forms, as in 6.55 and 6.56.
   6.54      Te suk-jan        u         anato nan jan               ne ?
             lQM NOM-plant     which FOC          2SG plant          �
             Which plants are the ones that you planted?
   6.55      Te nan jan        suk-jan        u        ne ?
             IQM 2sG plant      oM-plant      which    �M
             Which plants did you plant?
   6.56      Nan jan      surna ne ?
             2sG plant what �M
             What did you plant?
   In a sample of 1 27 information-seeking questions, 25% were topicalised.
   In Abun the constituents of a sentence that may be topicalised in questions are the subject.
Even though the subject is the topic, it may receive extra focus by the use of anato, as in
example 6.57 and object, as in 6. 54.
   6.57      Te je        u        anato      ndar    ne      jau     ne?

             Who was it that the dog bit?
   Other constituents such as location in example 6.58 cannot be topicalised.
   6.58      *Mo u           anato    nan ontu                   ne ?

   Abun has no special form for rhetorical questions. Instead interrogative sentences can be
used in a rhetorical sense; that is, the speaker not only is sure of the answer, but also requires
no answer. So on some occasions, although the structure is interrogative, the illocutionary
force i s not. This is plain in narrative texts where the speaker continues after asking a
'question' because the answer is obvious. Examples taken from text are:(i) a negative statement
   6.59      Ii da              sok ari              sarewo Yefun ne      sa u   ne ?
             ISG even. though enter church.service but        God OEM like which �
             1 . Even though I went to church, what was God like?
             2. Even though I went to church, I couldn't understand who God was.
   6.60      Ii     yo     bi     os  wa      ji      kern rno Dorn  nde
             I SG   NEG    POSS   way for     I SG    live in Sorong NEG
             be      je         u        anato rnewa       ji    ne ?
             later person which FOC              care.for ISG �
             1 . I had no way I could live in Sorong, who could take care of me?
             2. I couldn ' t live in Sorong because there was no one there who would have
                 taken care of me.(ii) an exclamation expressing surprise or even disgust
   6.6 1     An     jirnnot ware an          ki      do     ""Surna ben j i     anato
             3sG    think   FRUS 3sG         say     that   what   do   ISG    FOC
             ji      sern   rno      nat   re    e     ji   i     sare      ne ? ""
             ISG sleep we            place this and ISG sick like. this �
             1 . He thought about it with no success, ""What ever made me sleep in this place
                and get sick like this?""
             2. He couldn't work out what made him sleep in a place like that that made him
                so sick.
   Example 6.6 1 comes from a narrative, and at this point there was no interaction with
anyone. The speaker was really disgusted with himself for doing such a stupid thing. In
English we often ask ourselves, ""Why did I do such a stupid thing?"", in the sense, ""What a
stupid thing for me to have done !"" So the semantic force of this interrogative structure is not
to ask a question but to make a statement expressing disgust.(iii ) a statement expressing uncertainty
   This example comes from a narrative where the speaker was not interacting with anyone.
  6.62       An      ki    do     "" Ye      ne    Yesugote y e      Waropen bado ? ""
             3sG say that person that Irianese               person Waropen A(J.1
             1 . He said, ""Was that Irianese person a Waropen person?""
             2. I think he said that the Irianese person was a Waropen person.
1 16                                                                                 CHAPTER 6
(iv) a rebuke or negative command
   6.63     Nan nok         wa suma ne ?
            2sG afraid for what FQM
            1 . Why are you afraid?
            2. Don ' t be afraid!
    The above type of interrogative structure is a rhetorical question found in cases where the
speaker continues, not waiting for an answer. In the context of example 6.63, people said
(literally), ""Why are you afraid? Go on inside !"" In saying this they effectively rebuked the
one who was being slow about doing what he should have done.(v) a condition
   6.64      Yonatan    bi     ai     ndo   do    U Te more nu    sugit yo
             Yonatan    poss   father asked that IQM   here house food a
            yen bra jamsem yo              bado ? Ge         ber men git sore "".
            3PL boil cassava some AQv1               then    later I PL eat just
            Yonatan' s father said, ""If there is a restaurant here that boils cassava then let's
            just go and eat there"".
6.2 lMPERATlVES
   Imperative sentences convey a request, command, order, suggestion, instruction or an
entreaty. Sadock and Zwicky ( 1985: 1 7 1 ) note that since human social life so frequently
consists of activities of requesting, commanding and the like, no language (it seems) lacks a
form dedicated to imperative sentences. This is indeed true for Abun.
   First we will make some general typological comments about Abun imperative sentences
in relation to universal observations (§6.2. 1 ). This will be followed by a discussion of the
types of imperative sentences found in Abun consisting of the basic imperati ve type (§6.2.2),
a group of two types that may be called hortative (§6.2.3), and another type labelled
prohibitive (§6.2.4).
6.2. 1 lMPERATIVETYPOLOGY ANO ABUN
   Because the imperative mood is basically connected with the second person and relates to
an action to be performed in the immediate future, the second person pronoun, tense and
aspect distinctions are usually absent because they are implied. For this reason, verbs in the
imperative mood in many languages are in their most basic form. Indeed, Lyons ( 1 977: 746)
points out that in many languages imperative sentences are characterised by a change in the
form of the main verb of the sentence to its most simple form. However, in Abun, the form
of the verb is exactly the same as for declarative and interrogative moods. On the other hand,
consistent with most languages, tense and aspect distinctions, which are normally expressed
by adverbs and particles in Abun, are not found in imperative sentences. Instead Abun uses
optional particles to show strength of imperatives. These occur clause-finally.
   According to Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 985: 1 73), the removal of the subject pronoun and/or
verbal concord affix i s amazingly common. Abun, however, does not allow the removal of
MARKED MOODS                                                                                   1 17the subject in imperative sentences. On the contrary, subject is obligatory in all types of Abun
speech acts.","[126, 127, 128, 129]"
"
8. 1 . 1 PROHIBITIVE SENTENCES
   The primary negative particle nde is the only negative particle used to form prohibitive
sentences. The structure of this type of sentence is S !'RED nde, as in example 8 .2b. The
prohibitive sentence structure is used in Abun when the speaker wants to prohibit the subject
from doing a particular thing. Negative imperative sentences are the most common type of
prohibitive sentence. Example 8.2a is a simple indicative sentence, while 8 .2b is the same
sentence transformed to become a negative imperative sentence.
   8 . 2 a.   Nan woo
              2SG cry
              You are crying.
NEGATION                                                                                  133         b.   Nan wo nde!
              2sG cry NED
              Don 't cry !
   Here we have used the label 'prohibitive' to cover a more general type of negative
imperative (which includes first and third person, as well as second person) to distinguish it
from the normal use of the term 'negative imperative' , which implies a negative command to
only the second person, as discussed by Sadock and Zwicky ( 1 98 5 : 1 60) and in §6.2.3 .","[144, 145]"
"
8.2.4 NEGATIVE LOCAnON SENTENCES
   A location sentence attributes a location to the subject. Since location is one of the
predicate elements it also is negated by using both particles. The structure as shown in the
examples below is:                                         s yo LOCATIVE PHRASE/WORD nde
  8 . 20 a.     Musa    rno        nu.
                Musa LOC house
                Musa is at home.
          b. Musa yo       rno nu nde.
             Musa NEG LOC house NEG
             Musa is not at home.
  8 . 2 1 a.    Dao hi         irn            rno-re.
                Dao poss mother LOc-here
                Dao ' s mother is here.
          b.    Dao h i  irn    yo                   rno-re       nde.
                Dao poss mother NEG                  LOc-here     NEG
                Dao ' s mother is not here.
138                                                                                            CHAPTER S
  The locative phrase has the preposition mo (as in the examples above), which also in some
contexts means 'to exist' , and the negation of which follows the same pattern as in any
negative indicative sentence, as in the example below:   8.22 a.     Sugum    mo.
               money exist
               There is money.
          b. Sugum yo      mo          nde.
             money NEG exist           NEG
             There is no money.","[149, 150]"
"   This chapter presents the negation strategy used in Abun. Two particles form the basis of
negation. The primary particle is nde, which is a typical particle, a function word that is
invariant. Consistent with the isolating nature of the Abun language, nde does not vary for
tense, aspect, number or agreement. While nde is primary, a further particle, yo, also
invariant, is used in conj unction with it, mainly in the negation of indicative sentences. These
two particles bracket the predicate. In Abun, whenever two particles are used like this, the
function is to mark the extent of a particular grammatical constituent. Bracketing by a pair of
particles not only is one of the main strategies used in negation, but also is used in the
formation of relative clauses, both restrictive and unrestrictive (see §9), as well as
interrogative sentences (see §6. 1 ). In most cases of negation, the pair of particles yo . . nde
                                                                                           .
bracket the predicate to negate Abun sentences.",[143]

                 This work represents the combination of two theses written in fulfilment of the degree of
              Master of Arts by each of the two authors. The examiners of each thesis raised several
              points, which has led to this revised version. Two examiners made comments regarding the
              constituent analysis of complement clauses. The implications of these comments have been
              considered in both alterations to the original text and throughout various footnotes. One
              examiner noted that in the original thesis no mention was made of Foley and VanValin's
              work. This has now been included in such a way as to point out that a traditional
              subordination/coordination distinction cannot be maintained in Abun grammar. Several
              points raised by the examiners covering a wide range of areas, and of a minor nature have
              been addressed in the body of this work.","[8, 9, 10, 11]"

8.2.3 NEGATIVE DESCRIPTIVE SENTENCES
   A descriptive sentence is defined as a sentence that attributes an adjective to a noun, for
example 'Musa has a big arm' or 'The book is old' . The behaviour of words that could be
considered adjectives in Abun does not differ greatly from that of verbs. These words can act
as predicates, and so both particles are required to negate these sentence types. In such
sentences the adjectival part of the sentence is negated using the linked pair of yo and nde.
The structure of negative descriptive sentences as shown in the examples below is:                                              S yo ADJECTIVE nde
NEGATION                                                                                 137   8 . 1 7 a.   Isak h i           nggwe      sye.
                Isak poss       garden        big
                Isak ' s garden is big.
           b. lsak hi     nggwe      yo               sye     nde.
              Isak poss garden        NEG             big     NEG
              Isak's garden is not big.
   8 . 1 8 a.   Musa     i.
                Musa sick
                Musa is sick.           b. Musa yo       i   nde.
              Musa NEG sick NEG
              Musa is not sick.","[148, 149]"
"
6.2.4 PROHIBITIVE
    The prohibitive form prohibits action; for example, the addressee in the example above is
prohibited from going to see Sadrak' s mother. Compare the commands for action in 6.77a
-C , to the prohibition, using nde, in 6.77d. This example is a negative imperative applying to
the second person.
1 20                                                                                   CHAPTER 6
   The prohibitive form also encompasses first and third persons, hence the use of the label
'prohibitive' rather than 'negative imperative' . The term prohibitive includes all persons and
numbers in the same way as do requests and commands discussed above. Examples 6.78
and 6.79 show that the meaning can be regulatory or enforcing a prohibition, making clear
this form is not limited to negative imperatives. In these examples the third and first persons
are prohibited respectively. For further discussion see § 8. 1 . 1 .
   6.78      Nggon     git     ndam-syor          nde.
             Women eat bird-syor      NEG
             Women must not eat cassowary.
   6.79      Men git         sek           nde.
             1 PL eat   possum NEG
             We must not eat possum.
  The particle nde does not indicate any difference in urgency or force as the posItIve
imperatives do. Instead nde simply conveys prohibition. It is unacceptable to include the
hortative particles with nde in the following example:
   6.80      *Nan git j i          hi       sugit tom          nde!!
             2sG eat IsG           poss     food HORT(S)       NEG
             Don ' t eat my food! !","[131, 132]"
"7.2.3 ASSERTNE
   The third type of modality is assertive, which means that the speaker asserts very strongly
that his attitude about the proposition is really true. In other words, the speaker parenthetically
comments, ""I really mean it."", or in Australian colloquial terms, ""fair dinkum"". In a culture
where deception is considered positive, speakers need a way to convince the hearer that they
mean business. So in Abun the modal particle go is used to do this. For example:   7.3 1     Nan ges       go.
             2SG fall ASS
             1 . You will surely fall .
             2 . You will fall , I mean it.
   7.32      An     ndo mo        ye           yi       an   ndo   mo     ji    sore   go.
             3SG ask LOC person other 3SG ask LOC l SG only ASS
             He asked another person, but he should have j ust asked me, really.
   7.33      Be     an     bi       ya     gu     an    kwop re                go.
             later 3SG POSS husband kill 3SG die             PERF              ASS
             Her husband will have killed her, I mean it.
   This modal particle can be used in the past, as seen in example 7.32, but is usually used in
reference to an event that is about to take place, as seen in 7 . 3 1 and 7.33.",[141]
"
10.3. 1 . 1 ABUN VERB MORPHOLOGY
   Applying traditional labels such as infinitive or participial to Abun is difficult. Since Abun
lacks subject-verb agreement and various other means by which the verb may be marked,
the structural definitions that are applied to complement types of other languages (synthetic
rather than isolating languages) cannot be applied to Abun. In Abun the morphological shape
of the verb never changes. It is invariant. There are no verb participles in Abun so it is not
possible to have a participial complement. Neither is there an infinitive in Abun.
   Determining what an infinitive is for Abun is somewhat difficult in that such definitions
are usually based on variations of the basic verb, showing person-number marking of the
subject. As has already been stated the Abun verb is invariant since changes to aspect and
mood are carried by particles and subject-verb agreement is not marked in Abun. If an
infinitive is said to be a verb that is 'not able to take a subject NP' , this definition is also
problematic because verbs in Abun normally take a subject P. In Abun, verbs are never said
in isolation. For example, if an enquiry is made as to the Abun terms for such words as
'come' and 'go' the reply is always given using a personal pronoun, usually second person
singular. Therefore 'come' would be given as nan rna 'you come' and 'go' would be given
as na rnu 'you go' . An infinitive cannot be elicited because such a verbal form does not exist.
On some occasions the overt subject of a clause may be omitted, but this is an option the
speaker has and is not obligatory. Predicates which take the -wa suffix may allow the subject
of the complement clause to be elided if it is co-referential with the subject of the main
clause. For example:
   10.56     Ji i-wa          da      ron        a-reo
             l sG happY-TRs drink medicine Foc-this
             I am happy to (or agree to) take some medicine now.
   This type of ellipsis is not common, as it i s more usual that the subject is repeated. In
either case the form of the verb is the same whether there is a subject NP or not. Therefore it
is not possible to determine what is an infinitive verb form in Abun. Since Abun verb
morphology is always invariant it cannot be stated that Abun has a separate infinitive verb
form. Neither does it have a participial form. It follows then that because Abun has no verbal
infinitives, neither can it have infinitive complements. Therefore, this means of encoding a
complement clause by means of distinctive verb morphology is not applicable for Abun .
Because changes to verb morphology within the complement clause cannot identify
complement types, other methods need to be used.
   Giv6n did not list any other means of syntactically encoding a complement clause. The
various means that he has described, with the exception of the ""subordinating morpheme"",
are all means of identifying the complement clause as such by some type of syntactic
marking within the complement clause itself. These means have proved unproductive for
Abun. Noonan ( 1 985 :44), like Giv6n, lists various ways of identifying complement clauses
one being ""the external syntactic relations of the complement construction as a whole"". It
seems that for Abun the only way of identifying complement clauses is not from inside the
embedded complement clause but from outside of it. One such means is the
1 80                                                                                          CHAPTER 10complementiser. If there is no complementiser, as in the cases under discussion here, there is
other evidence external to the complement clause which can indicate that it is embedded
within the main clause. There are various structural indications of subordination in Abun .
Two of them will be given here to provide evidence that these complement clauses are, in
fact, subordinate to the main clause as embedded objects. The first deals with the structure of
a negative sentence; the second concerns the transitive implications of the suffixes on the
main clause verbs found in these types of construction.","[191, 192]"
"
   The first o f these particles, yo, is the first particle of a linked pair o f particles, where the
second particle is nde ' NEGATIVE'. Yo occurs only in negative indicative sentences as in
example 5. 1 . For further discussion of this predicate marker and its role in delineating the
scope of negation see §8.5.
     5.1      A n yo        ma       mo      nu        nde.
              3PL NEG   come LOC house NEG
              They did not come to the house.
   The second of the predicate markers, waii, indicates that the action is the same type of
action as the previous one. The object is also the same type of object, as seen in the sentences
below:
     5.2      Men mu          nai    sugit    e te   Apner        ki    nai    Isak do
              I PL go         get    food     then Apner          said to      Isak COM
              ""Nan waii mu nai sugit "".
              2sG    also   go     get food
              We went to get food, then Apner said to Isak, ""You also go and get some
              food"".
     5.3      An       we     sam      nyim m o        nu         ete   men      waii sam           wari.
              3SG two carry ahead LOC house then IPL                 also carry behind
              They (two) carried (things) ahead of us to the house and we also carried
              (things) after them.
  The third and fourth predicate markers are used in complex sentences only. Below is one
example of each.
     5 .4     Yunus da               sok-wa       Isak      sare. . .
              Yunus actuaJly look-TRS Isak but
              Yunus actually looked at Isak but... (he didn't do anything)
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                                67   5.5        Men do    is         mone sa                          men yo     ku   auto nde.
              1 PL PRED came. down there then-RFAL                  1 PL NEG   find car  NEG
              And when we landed there we did not find a car.
   The other modifying component of Abun verb phrases is verbal particles. These particles
are attached to certain verbs like 'up' in the English, 'He looked up the words ' , which may,
in English, also be in the form, 'He looked the words up' . This type of verbal particle is
referred to by Schachter ( 1 985:45) who comments that they frequently have a directional or
locative notion. Abun has similar forms as seen in the following examples:
   5.6 a.     An gwat      buku      ma          mo     nu.
              3SG carry   book come LOC house
              He brought the book to the house.
         b.   An gwat      buku      m u mo       nu.
              3sG carry   book go LOC house
              He took the book to the house.
   5.7        Pa    bare    jamsem          ne    we          mo   nden.
              child throw cassava DEI' away LOC                    outside
              The child threw away the cassava outside.
   5.8        A n grem buku          ne      kwop mo          nu     m it.
              3SG put  book          DEI'    down LOC         house inside
              He put the book down inside.
    In English the verbal particles 'up' , 'down ' , and so on, may be continuous or
discontinuous with the verb. In Abun, however, the particle is discontinuous when there is a
direct object, as seen in the examples above. When the verb i s intransitive, the verbal particle
is continuous with the verb, as in example 5.9:
   5.9        Nan jam  we.
              2sG move away
              Get out of the way !
   Schachter ( 1 985:45) states that in some languages verbal particles are derived from
adpositions, while in other languages they are not. None of the Abun verbal particles appear
to have been deri ved from adpositions. Instead, most of the verbal particles are derived from
verbs such as mu 'go ' , ma 'come' and kwop 'die ' . Some, such as we ' away ' , are used only

1 2.2 THE PREPOSmON AS CONJUNCfION
     Traditionally prepositions and conjunctions have been considered as two separate word
classes within a language. Recently Huddleston ( 1 984:338) has proposed, at least for
English, that prepositions and subordinating conjunctions be conflated into a single class
( 1 984:338). Some of the reasoning behind this ( 1 984:339) that is applicable to Abun as well
                                               203
204                                                                                      CHAPTER 12as English is that a number of these words ""enter into construction with either an NP or a
clause"". Abun prepositions behave like conjunctions in that a large number of the class of
prepositions have the ability to link a clause to a larger construction. Where they differ from
the other conjunction groups listed in Table 1 2 . 1 is in their ability to embed clauses within
larger units. It will be shown later that other conjunctions in Abun link independent clauses.
These conjunctions have been described as compounding conjunctions because of their
ability to create new forms and extend their range of meaning.
   The following Table 1 2.2 lists those Abun prepositions that behave also as conjunctions.
For some, when they are used to link a clause rather than an NP, their original meaning is
extended.

              wade              until                          until

              su                with INSTRUMENT                with
     The majority of Abun prepositions may act as conjunctions. However, the general locative
mo 'at/in' can be used only in association with the relative clause marker gato. 37 Some of the
prepositions such as subot 'along' karowa 'close to/near' and su 'with' are not commonly
used as conj unctions. Examples of those that are more commonly used, both as prepositions
and as conjunctions, are given below:
(i) ' wa ' 'for/in order to'
     1 2. 1        An    fro       nu     yo    wa      men.
                   3SG prepare house DET(I) for         I PL
                   She prepared a house for us.
     1 2.2         Marta tot su-gato     gum do brer gwat ma wa men git sugit mo.
                   Marta cut thing-REL name COM brer bring DIR for I PL eat food on
                   Marta cut some brer (leaves) and brought them back for us to eat our food on.
  The clause that follows the preposition wa in example 1 2.2 above is considered as a single
constituent. As discussed in Chapter 10 earlier, there is no non-finite form of the verb in
Abun, thus men git sugit mo represents a single clause.","[215, 216]"

4.5.4 MOOD
    According to Lyons ( 1 968:307) the term mood ""is best defined in relation to an
' unmarked' class of sentences which express simple statements of fact, unqualified with
respect to the attitude of the speaker towards what he is saying"".
   In Abun the indicative mood is unmarked while the other two basic types of mood are
marked by the use of particles which occur clause-final. In addition Abun also marks another
mood, that of frustrated action. A list of all Abun mood particles is given in Table 3 . 1 6 in
§3.4.5.
   Interrogative mood, in addition to the question word itself, has two particles that bracket
the clause, te 'INITIAL QUESTION MARKER' , for all types of questions and a final question marker
which is one of:
           ne               INFORMATION FINAL QUESTION MARKER (example 4.42)
           e                YES/NO FINAL QUESTION MARKER (example 4.43)
           bado             ALTERNATIVE QUESTION MARKER (example 4.44)
           fe               CONFIRMATIVE QUESTION MARKER (example 4.45)
  The initial question marker is optional; however, the final question marker is obligatory.
More details of interrogative structure types are found in Chapter 6.

   The initial question marker, te , is used to alert the hearer that a question i s about to be
asked. It is more commonly used within a complex sentence, as in example 4.46, than in
60                                                                                       CHAPTER 4simple sentences. In a sample of 1 94 questions in the corpus of data, te occurred 4 1 times,

                 pigs eaten the plants in the garden?
   For imperative , the following particles are clause-final: se (Abun Ji) and the dialectal
variant, tom (Abun Tat) STRONG HORTATIVE as in example 4.47; et MIlD HORTATIVE 4.48, and nde
'PROHlBITIVE' 4.49. The unmarked form, 'BASIC IMPERATIVE' 4.50, is distinguished from
indicative mood by context. For further discussion regarding imperative mood see §6.2.

   Frustrated action mood uses the particle ware, as in example 4.5 1 . The nearest English
equivalent would be 'in vain' , 'to no avail' or 'but without success ' . Its meaning is that an
action was attempted but the goal of the action was not achieved. It is clause-final like other
moods following modal markers. See §6.3 for more details.

41   Sentences of the type that Foley and Van Valin describe can in fact be found for Abun but in these
     cases they do not make use of any conjunction. The two clauses are juxtaposed and a mood
     particle after the final clause is understood to apply to both clauses.
42   One exception is su-bere 'so that'. In this word the preposition su 'with' compounds with the time
     word bere 'later' to form a conjunction. Most conjunctions do not compound with time words as is
     the case here, the only exception being onde-ber 'otherwise.will' which will be discussed later.

   The compound sa-we is derived from sa 'like' and we 'because' . The second clause of
the sentence expresses some undesirable aim or purpose which should be avoided.

(ii) sarewo 'however'
   The compound sarewo is made up of sare 'like.this' and wo 'but'. In many instances its
meaning is interchangeable with wo 'but' . Often it is best translated as 'however' . While wo
is used to express a semantic relationship of contrast between clauses, sarewo is more likely
to express the semantic relationship of contra-expectation.

onde is a negative particle this conjunction will be discussed in the final section of this
chapter on negative conjunctions.","[223, 224]"

7. 1 ASPECT
   The notion of aspect, according to Comrie ( 1 976: 1 -3), tends to be a less familiar notion to
students of linguistics than other terms for verbal categories. In order to define the term, he
firstly distinguishes it from tense. He points out that ""aspects are different ways of viewing
the internal temporal constituency of a situation"". Lyons ( 1 968:3 1 5) also distinguishes tense
from aspect by noting that tense has to do with the location in time of an action or state,
whereas aspect has to do with the distribution of time or contour of an action or state. He
claims that the main aspectual notions of 'completion' and 'duration' are found in many
languages.
    Abun uses particles to express aspectual notions. The notion of 'completion ' is expressed
by two particles, re and it, while the notion of 'incompleteness' is expressed by the particle
to. When these optional particles occur, they follow negative markers, where present, but
precede mood and modality particles.",[134]
