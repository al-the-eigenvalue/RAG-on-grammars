"   With preverbal subjects, teha?(a) ‘not’ is added to the beginning o f the
clause, as in 837-840:
(837) Tsa dibye péétune.
      teha? ti-p’è   phé:-thm-nè      ‘He did not go.’
      not that-(SgM) go-neg-(n)(838) Tsa dibye majchotu(ne).
      teha? ti-p’è   max$ho-thm-(nè)        ‘He has not eaten.’
      not that-(SgM) eat-neg-(n)(839) teha? o a:?iBè-thm (Tsa o aah+vetu.)         ‘ I did not go home.’
      not I go.home-neg(840) Tsa dibye majchóityu(ne).
      teha? ti-p’è   max$hó-i-tjhm-(nè)       ‘He will not eat.’
      not that-(SgM) eat-fut-neg-(n)
Three features of negatives suggest that negative clauses are structurally
subordinate clauses, complements to a higher predicate teha?a ‘not’:
1. low tone on the proclitic subject pronoun,
2. high tone on the verb’s first syllable, and
3. -ne (n) at the end o f the clause. Although this has been glossed (n),
   it may be the suffix glossed (0) that is used in forming subordinate
   clauses.
The structure of 839 would be as in 841:
(841) [v teha? ] [NP [s [NP o ] a:?i§è-thrn ] -nè ]
         not                I go.home-neg -(0)

      teha? o $hé:nè-thm-(nè)   ‘I did not eat (fruit).’
      not I eat-neg-(n)

(843) Tsa o awacunutu(ne).

        not I eat-go.do-neg-(n)    teha?(a) ‘not’ may be followed by the clitic -i ‘projected time’ (PT); in
this case the negation applies to the meaning of the clitic. For example, in
845 teha?ai (not-PT) denies that the event has already happened:1
(845) Tsahai dibye tsaatune.
        teha?a-i [ti-p’è  teha:-thm ]-nè               ‘He has not yet come.’
        not-PT that-(SgM) come-neg -(n)     With postverbal subjects, there is no overt negative word (like teha?(a)
‘not’ in the previous examples) and the classifier subject occupies the place
o f -ne (0). Thus, two arguments for the claim that these negatives are sub­
ordinate are not available; the only available argument is that the first syl­
lable of the verb bears high tone (as characteristic of subordinate clauses).
Examples follow. In 846, -©:pè (SgM) delinks the low tone o f -© thm ‘neg’
in order to place its low tone on -thm.
(846) maxtfhó-thm-:pè (Majchótuube.) ‘He has not eaten (bread).’
      eat-neg-(SgM)
(847) a. tó:-thm-:pè     (dóótuube)                  ‘He has not eaten (meat).’
      b. a:?i'Bé-thm-:pè (aah+vétuube)               ‘He did not visit.’
      c. maxtfho-thm-mè (majchotume)                 ‘They have not eaten
                                                      (bread).’13.3        Contrastive negation with -j++va ‘deny’-hi:(§a) (-j++va) ‘deny’ indicates contrastive or emphatic negation, denying
that the referent o f the phrase to which it is cliticized was or did what has
been asserted (or assumed) about it. The form -hi:§a is used at the end of
a sentence and -hi: is used within a sentence. -hi:(§a) may be cliticized to
verbs (13.3.1) or to nominals (13.3.2).
  1This is consistent w ith the suggestion that teka?a behaves like a com plement-taking verb.","[360, 361]"

tions, i.e., negative imperatives.
    -O (?)ti ‘prohibit’ indicates that the action o f the host verb should not
be done, forming a PRO H IBITIO N or NEGATIVE IM PERATIVE. -O ?ti (-h d i)
is used with monosyllabic verbs and -(L)ti (- d i) with polysyllabic ones. As
with (L)thm ‘neg’, -pe (n) may follow -(?)ti. These points are illustrated in
the following examples:
(856 )phè-^ti-(pè)    (jP eh d fn e! ~ jP e h d fi) ‘Don’t go!’
      go-prohibit-(n)
(857 )mé:nm-ti-(pè) (jM éé n u d fn e! ~ jM é é n u d f!) ‘Don’t do it!’

           mè max$ho-ti-(pè)        ‘Do not eat (bread)! (p l)’
           SAP eat-neg-(n)Generally a prohibition will end ((...ü)ü)ü-ti-(pè)#. However, the (O of
-O (?)ti may be blocked by another low tone, as in 860 with -(L)the ‘go to
do’:
(8 6 0 ) max$ho-thé-ti-(pè) (jM djchotédf(ne)!) ‘Do not go to eat (bread)!’
           eat-go.do-neg- (n)
13.5 Negation in subordinate clausesSubordinate clauses are negated with -(L)thm ‘neg’ but they never have
teha?(a) ‘not’ as in main clauses. In 861 negation occurs in a relative clause
and in 862 and 863 it occurs in a case-marked subordinate clause used as
an adverb:
(8 6 1 )                        Diibye m ajchótuube ds+j+véhi.
           ti-:piè    O rmaxtfhó-thm ]-:pè    teihï§é-?i
           that-(SgM)    eat-neg      -(SgM) die-(t)
           ‘The one who did not eat died.’
(8 6 2 ) Diibye im ajchótu neri ds+j+véhi.

           ‘ Because he did not eat, he died.’(8 6 3 ) Im ajch ó tu n eri ds+j+veébe.
            [i    max^hó-thm ]-nè-ri          teihi§è-:pè
             self eat-neg      -(event)-oblln die-(SgM)
           ‘ Because he did not eat, he died.
   2In 862 the first w ord has a long vow el, even though it is the subject. This is because
a subordinate clause intervenes betw een the subject and the verb; see the discussion that
accompanies example 635, page 270.","[364, 365]"
"12.1      ConjunctionsBora has no word like English and. The conjunction o f nominals is
achieved by means of suffixes or by a “ summation” word as discussed in
section 7.6.
    There are two disjunctive morphemes, ami ‘or’ and mitjha ‘or’, which
to our knowledge are entirely interchangable. They are used to ask which
of two alternatives is correct, occurring between the clauses that express
the alternatives, as in the following examples:
(818) iA u majchoó mitya tsa u majchóityune?
     a m maxf ho-ó-? mitjha teha? m max$hó-i-tjhm-nè
     yh you eat-fut-(t) or  not you eat-fut-neg-(n)a
     ‘Will you eat or not?’(819) 'LA óma u peéhi mitya u cóévaahi dfnaallema?

ellipsed:

They are never part of a sentence.1
 uix ( uj) ~ hm?m:: (juhuu) expresses surprise
 ^hix (chfj) ~ $4:: (chff) expresses surprise or admiration
 pó:o: (n ó ó o o ) expresses happiness
    Many other interjections are used in the interaction between people:
to get another’s attention, to answer, or to indicate a reaction. A few of
the more common follow:
 éhè (é je ) calls attention to look at something (like English ‘Look!’)
 ahm (a ju ) calls attention to receive something given (like English ‘Here!
      Take it!’)
 aax (a a j) answers a call or indicates a question (like English ‘Yes, what do
      you want?’)
 hmmhmx (juujuj) ~ hmm (juu) ~ uiui ( uu) indicates agreement (like En­
      glish OK.)
 maa?mmx (m aah u u j) indicates that one does not know (like English ‘I
      don’t know!’)
 hm:m (juuu) indicates incredulity (like English ‘I can’tbelieve it!’12.3        ParticlesThe PARTICLES listed below call attention, express surprise, ask permis­
sion, and so forth. In contrast to the interjections discussed in section
12.2, the particles are sentence constituents.","[353, 354]"

as the one glossed (0). This would be the case if negative clauses were
complements to a negative verb (one which time has robbed of most verbal
responsibilities and privileges). This would not only explain the presence
of -ne, but also the fact that the initial syllable o f the verb o f negative
clauses bears high tone. For example, 236 above would structurally be
the following:(2 3 8 ) [vteha?] [NP [s o max$ho-thm ] nè ]          ‘I did not eat it.’
               deny         I eat-neg         (0 )5.5            Statements of factAnother sort o f sentence, one used to state a fact, consists simply o f a
subordinate clause terminated with - © ©ne (0). Presumably this clause
is the predicate complement o f an implicit verb be, the implicit subject of
which is something like fact. The first sentence of 239 illustrates this type
o f sentence:
(2 3 9 )       Ó m ajch oróne. A ró n a a tsa o ó ó vetu n e.
           0 maxqno-ro-ne. A-ro-naa          tèna' o o:pe-tnra-ne.

           ‘ (It is a fact) that I ate. However, I am not full.’
This has the same feel as English It is afact thatl ate. Other examples are
816 and 817 on page 317.","[166, 167]"

    Negation within a complement may be expressed in the main clause
(yielding the sort o f example that has been used to motivate “ neg raising”).
For example, 864 is understood to mean ‘I want that [he not g o ]’, where
either ‘he’ or ‘go’ is negated. However, structurally teha(?) [...]-thm(nè) has
within its scope the main verb ïmi^è ‘I want’, the object complement of
which is extraposed:
(8 6 4 ) T sa o fm illetu dibye péén eé.
      teha? o fmftfè-thm [ti-p’è phe: ]-nèé         ‘I don’t want
      not I want-neg that-(SgM) go -(0)             h im to g o .’

Chapter 14ImperativesImperatives are generally used to teil the hearer to do or not to do some­
thing. One type of imperative, namely prohibitions, was discussed in sec­
tion 13.4. In this chapter, the form o f imperatives is discussed in section
14.1, various ways to modify imperatives in section 14.2, and degrees of
strength of imperatives in 14.3.
   Imperative verbs bear the nonfinite low tone as described in section
14.1.1. Throughout this grammar, the nonfinite tone is sometimes repre­
sented with N over the vowel of the syllable that bears the nonfinite low
tone. In this chapter this nonfinite low tone is represented with I to remind
the reader that this is the “imperative” tone.","[365, 366, 367]"

(232) a. Ó fmfbajchóhi.
           ó imipaxtfhó-?i                       ‘I fix.’

           I fix-go.do-now-(t)
However this may be blocked by other lexically marked low tones. For
example, in 233 the verb sterns have a lexically marked low tone on the
antepenult, so - © © ? (i) (t) cannot doek its © on the penult:(233) a. ó a:?i§é-?i             (ó aah+véhi)          ‘ I visit.’
       b. ó amapmkhm-?i (ó amabucuhi) ‘ I hug.’   Sentence finally, the segments of - © © ? (i) (t) are both spoken and
written, as in 234a; sentence medially, the /?/ is spoken but not written,
whereas the /i/ is neither spoken nor written, as in 234b.10
(234) a. ó a?tó-?i                  (Ó ahdóhi.)       ‘I paid.’
         I pay-(t)                    ^
      b. ó a?tó-?_ti-:piè-khè       (Ó ahdó dnbyeke.) ‘I paid him.
         I pay-(t) that-(SgM)-objAn
5.4.2        -ne (n)The morpheme - © ©nè (n) is suffixed to the verbs o f negative sentences,
whether declarative or imperative. It occupies the position - © © ?i (t) oc-
cupies in a nonnegative sentence. However, unlike - © © ?i (t), an explicit
preverbal subject is not required, as shown by 235:
(235) max$ho-ti-(pè) (jM ajchodf(ne)!) ‘Do not eat!’
      eat-neg-(n)Following -thm ‘negative’, - © ©ne (n) is optional:(236)teha? o maxtfho-thm-(nè) (Tsa o majchotu(ne).) ‘ I did not eat it.’
      not I eat-neg-(n)
   In a prohibition, if -ne does not follow the verb, then a glottal stop
does,11 as in 237 (in which the glottal stop is not written):  10There is some variation, w ith younger speakers pronouncing less o f the segmental mate-
rial o f this suffix than older speakers.
  ''T h is may reflect the presence o f -<T)0?i (t).","[165, 166]"
"
    Example 959 begins “ I was gladdend” (not included in 959), followed
by an adverbial clause of the sort discussed in section 17.4.2. The verb of
this clause is “teil,” which has an object complement expressing what was
told. (The subject o f the complement clause is the noun phrase “ those to
whom I taught the truth.”) The structure o f 959 is given in figure 16.4:
(959) ...tm+aaju o uwaabómé imf uraavyéné oke ditye uuballéneri.

      the truth are following well.’

   An object complement may be an embedded content question, as in
the subordinate clause beginning with mm-:pè-khé ‘whom’ in 960 and with
mm-?a ‘who’ in 961. Embedded alternative questions are expressed using
a conditional clause, as in 973.

      ‘ I do not know who (or what animals) come.’16.3        -ne (0 ) versus (event)Three suffixes have the segmental shape /-ne/. One, glossed (n), follows
-© thm (-tu) ‘negative’; see section 13.2. The other two are glossed (0) and
(event). This section deals with the contrast between these two.
   (0) represents a thing, that is, an inanimate object that typically persists
over time (and can be localized in space). By contrast, an event typically                             ©2012 SIL International ®

not typically have the time stability o f objects.5 Both - © 0 nG ($) an^ -ne
(event) are used following subordinate verbs, so the verb’s initial syllable
bears high tone. However, the former imposes a low tone on its host’s
penult while the latter does not:                                    #ü...crane(0) (thing)
                                    #a...aone             (event)This difference is visible only on verbs that have three or more syllables,6
as in 962, in which the tone of the verb’s penult (/pa/) correlates with
whether the clause bearing -ne refers to an object (962a) or an event
(962b):

4.3.5    Negative deverbal adjectivesThe suffix -thrn (-tu) ‘negative, without doing’, added to an active verb,
derives the adjective referring to the state of not having done or under-
gone the action of that verb. It is often in apposition to another noun or
pronoun, as in 188 and 189:
(188) 0 pee teene fmfbajchótuubére.
      0 phé:-?i thè:-nè imipaxtfhó-thm-:pé-fè    ‘ I am going without
      1 go-(t) that-(0) fix-neg-(SgM)-only         fixing it.’-ra ‘frustrative, contraexpectation’ often accompanies -thm ‘negative’, as
in the following examples. Note that in 189 the participle refers to the
subject o f maxf ho ‘eat’:
(189) Majchóratu u oomfhi.
      maxtfhó-ra-thm m o:mi-?i         ‘You are returning without
      eat-frs-neg    you return-(t)     eating.’In 190 max$hó-ra-thm is used as a predicate complement:
(190) a. maxtfhó-ra-thm thè:-nè        (Majchóratu teéne.)
         eat-frs-neg    that-(0)
      b. thè:-nè        maxtfhó-ra-thm (Teene majchóratu.)
         that-(0)       eat-frs-neg
      a,b. ‘That has not been eaten.’
4.3.6    Affixal “verbs”Some suffixes are like bound, complement-taking verbs. They follow a
verb root or stem, heading the verb + suffix combination. These suffixes
are: -teho ‘causative’ (see section 5.8.1, page 144),     O p hï ‘do to excess,
excessive’ (see 4.3.6.1 below), -^e ‘try to do’ (4.3.6.2), -phexteho ‘do upon
encountering’ (4.3.6.3), as well as the “relocation” suffixes discussed in
section 4.3.6.4.",[150]

Chapter 11CliticsEnclitics (which we generally refer to simply as “ clitics”) have syntactic or
semantic “ scope” over an entire phrase. They attach themselves phono-
logically to the last word o f a phrase.1 Bora uses the following types of
clitics (among others, e.g., the personal pronominal subject proclitics of
table 10.1, page 270):
1. Second p o s it io n clitics occur only following a clause’s first con­
   stituent; these include:
   (a) TEMPORAL, i.e., ones that indicate tense (the time of an event rel­
       ative to the time o f speaking) are -phe ~ -© o ‘remote past’, -(?)ne
       ‘recent past’, and -iikjhè ~ -i ‘future’. These are discussed in section
       5.9.3. They are also included in figure 11.1; note that they do not
       all occupy the same position relative to the other clitics.
   (b) EVIDENTIAL, i.e., ones that indicate how the speaker came to know
       what she or he is reporting; see section 11.1.
   (c) The verb ‘to be’ ixkjha has become a second-position clitic in a type
       o f predicate complement structure; see section 5.10.2.
2. ADVERBIAL clitics follow various classes o f sentence constituent; see
   section 11.2.
3. A NEGATIVE clitic is discussed in section 13.3, page 13.3.
    The clitics occur in the order given in table 11.1:   *W e do N O T intend a strong claim that the morphemes discussed here are strictly clitics as
opposed to suffixes. Examples like 790, in w hich -ro ‘ frs’ precedes -:pè -(S gM ), suggest that
-ro is a suffix rather than a clitic.","[337, 338, 339]"

In the index, entries are ordered according to the English alphabet. Bora
words are written according to the Bora writing system (the “ practical
orthography”) to facilitate finding them in alphabetical order.
EXAMPLES:
Examples generally present four types of information. The position of
these parts varies in the interest o f saving space. (1) The Bora example is
written in a phonetic or phonemic form using the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA). (2) The example is also written in the Bora writing
system, with this sort o f font (sans serif). This is sometimes located
above the phonetic / phonemic representation and sometimes following
the phonetic / phonemic form (in parentheses). (3) A
morpheme-by-morpheme gloss is given either below the Bora example or
in parentheses following it. (4) A free translation follows, either on a line
below the morpheme-by-morpheme text or following it at the end o f the
line.
BORA C ITATIO N FORMS:
(a) Words given “ in isolation” (i.e., without any preceding or following
text) may meet the conditions for the application of either PLTS or FLTS.
If so, the isolation form will be the output o f the rule (which is how it
would be pronounced in isolation). (b) Sometimes the phonetic /
phonemic representation of words, roots, affixes,...make lexically                            ©2012 SIL International ®

marked tones explicit, as discussed below, while omitting the tones of
other syllables. (c) When verbs are cited, the phonetic / phonemic
representation may make lexically marked tones explicit whereas the
orthographic form gives the nonfinite form; see section 4.1, page 100,
especially figure 4.1. For example, akpakhumrn (awacunu) ‘to yawn’.
PHRASE MARKERS:
Phrase markers ( “ trees”) with which structure is represented are
intended as suggestive, neither definitive nor what would might be
expected for any particular theoretic perspective. Some sentences are
given with a rather flat structure. This makes it easier to deal with Bora’s
relatively free word order, but at the cost o f sometimes obscuring
subcategorization relationships. For example, see the tree given for
example 662, page 277. Some affixes are treated as separate syntactic
constituents; for example, case markers are treated as postpositions.
TONE DERIVATIONS:
The Bora forms in tone derivations are written as Bora people normally
read and write their language. Tone derivations use the font with
which this sentence is written.
LETTERS REPRESENTING USES OF TONE:
We sometimes use v to highlight a high tone and v to highlight a low
tone. Further, to help the reader keep track of different uses o f tone, we
sometimes indicate the use by writing a small letter over the vowel.
These letters are as follows:
              LETTER   TONE                USE
              c

action versus iteration, and so forth.17 This is discussed in section 5.7.2.
   The suffix -thrn(rn) ‘negative’ may occur between the root and the sin­
gular versus multiple suffix, as in 156:
(156) khé?'é-thmm-:Bè       (kéhyétuuuve) ‘become listless’
      have.strength-neg-sln       mfia?-thmm-:fiè (uvahtuuuve) ‘be dumbfounded’
       alert(?)-neg-slnIn this position, -thm(m) ‘negative’ is frequently preceded by -ra ‘frustrat­
ive, contraexpectation’, as in 157, but -ra does not occur in this position
without -thm(m).
(157) tfépó-ra-thmm-:Be (lléboratuuuve) ‘become deaf’
      hear-frs-neg-sln       kpahakhm-ra-thumi-:3è (wdjdcurdtuuuve) ‘bewildered, stunned’
       know-frs-neg-sln
4.3.2      Verbs derived from nounsVerbs are derived from nouns by one o f the following suffixes:18 -$e ‘treat
like, regard as’, - © O nm ‘do’, -:§e ‘become’, -the ‘become’, -§a ‘have’ or
-xkhimei ‘behave like’. These will be discussed in turn.
4.3.2.1    -lle ‘treat like, regard as’The suffix -(OO$G(""He) ‘treat like, regard as’ and -(OOnm ( _nu) ‘cause to
have, do’ derive transitive verbs. With -$e (-lle) ‘regard as’, the referent of
the direct object is compared to the referent o f the host (i.e., the noun to
which       is suffixed). For example, in 158 he (subject) regards me (object)
as a child (host):
(158) oke ts++ménélleébe.
      0-khè tehi:méné-^è-:pè               ‘He considers me to be
      1-objAn child-regard-(SgM)            like a child.’
  17For this reason the Bora dictionary (Thiesen & Thiesen 1998) lists both singular and
m ultiple forms for verbs.
  18These m ight be considered noun-incorporating verbs.","[142, 143]"
"
5.12.1      Affixal adverbsSome suffixes (or clitics) modify verbs in ways that seem adverbial (going
beyond matters like tense, aspect, and argument structure). In this section
we will describe two o f these.
5.12.1.1    -juco ( : ) ‘n o w ’The verbal suffix - © Ohtukho: ‘now’ is obviously related to the clitic
-OOhtukho ‘focus’ discussed in section 11.2.2. The difference is that the
verbal suffix is a temporal pointer, translated ‘now’, ‘already’, ‘still’ or ‘yet’,
whereas the clitic marks information as focal.
    In some cases the event indicated by the verb to which -hrnkho: is suf-
fixed happens at the time of speaking, so is translated ‘now’. See examples
285a and b, page 153; 543, page 241; 738, page 299; and 1062, page 405.
   In other cases the event indicated by the verb happened before the
time o f speaking, as in 299 (where -hrnkho: is translated ‘already’) and the
negative, as in 300 (where it is translated ‘yet’). See also 222, page 129,
and 761, page 306.
(299) maxtfhó-hmkho-:pè (Majchójucoóbe.) ‘He has already eaten.’

5.12.1.2   -ro ~ -ra ~ -yo ~ -ya ‘frustrative, contraexpectation’The suffix -ro ~ -ra ~ -jo ~ -ja ‘frustrative, contraexpectation,’ indicates
that the action referred to by the verb does not fulfill its purpose, does not
turn out well, or was done in vain. When -?i (t) follows, -ra ~ -ja is used,
as in 301 and 302:
(301) o majchorahi.
      ó max$ho-ra-?i       ‘I have eaten (but not satisfactorily).’
      I eat-frs-(t)(302) Ó majchóiyahi.
      ó max$hó-i-ja-?i      ‘I want to eat (but
      I eat-fut-frs-(t)    there is nothing to eat).’
Otherwise, that is when -?i (t) does not follow, -ro ~ -jo is used, as in 303
and 304:
(303) max$ho-ró-mè (Majchoróme.) ‘They eat (but want more).’
      eat-frs-(AnPl)(304) Majchóiyóme.
      max$hó-i-jó-mè         ‘They would like to eat
      eat-fut-frs-(AnPl)     (but there isn’t anything).’
   The suffix -ra ~ -ro ‘frustrative, contraexpectation’ may also express an
unfulfilled desire (somewhat like a subjunctive):(305) Uuma o pééiyahi.
      m:-ma    o phé:-i-ja-?i        ‘I would like to go with you
      you-with I go-fut-frs-(t)       (but I am not able).’
    In example 306 the subject is a relative clause containing -ro ‘frustrat­
ive, contraexpectation’:
(306) Chéméroobe wakfmyeftyéhi.
      $hémé-ro-:pè kpakhimièi-tjhé-?i
      sick-frs-(SgM) work-go.do-(t)
      ‘ Even though he was sick, he went to work.’Section 11.2.5 has further examples with the ‘contraexpectation’ meaning.
Compare the preceding example (306) with 790.","[191, 192]"

starting in 1957, they built a new communal house, a school, a church, and
individual homes around the plaza facing the communal house. The new
town was named Brillo Nuevo.
    For a time, the excitement o f reading, writing, arithmetic, and classes
for learning Spanish made it worthwhile to live closely together. Then
they began to realize that many changes were negative. There were too
many people, chickens, and dogs in one area. Women had to go farther
from the town to tend their fields. Game was soon depleted, so they had
to go farther away to hunt for their meat. And, while they were generally
loyal to their clans, they began stealing from each other’s fields.
   Eventually, everyone except the chief and his family moved away from
the plaza on the hill, resettling along the river front. Some built their
houses farther away, yet near enough that the children could walk to
school. This reduced the concentration o f people and animals, but many
must still go considerable distances to make their fields and to hunt. Re-
cently, they are making fields on closer land that was farmed 20-30 years
ago.","[38, 39]"

14.3.1         ExplanationsAlthough explanations are not imperatives, we begin with them because
they can be interpreted as suggestions, that is, as very weak imperatives.
Explanations present the subject with either mm:nè (IndefAnPl) ‘indefinite
animate plural’ or mm?a (IndefAnSg) ‘indefinite animate singular’. The
verb bears the pronominal proclitic me- (m e - ~ m a-) ‘SAP’ and ends with
-?i (t). This is illustrated in 904:7(9 0 4 )a. Illu muune nuhbake m éfm fbajchóhi.        b. Illu muha nuhbake m éfm fbajchóhi.                        a. mm:nè

        b. ‘We (ex.) fix the clock like this.’
14.3.2         ExhortationTo exhort a hearer to some action, the pronoun mmm (m uu) ‘indefinite
animate singular’ is used as the preverbal subject. For example, 905a is a
declarative and 905b is the corresponding exhortation:(905)       a. U fmfbajchó d+hm++ne.
        b. Muu fmfbajchó d+hm++ne.
                                                                      a. ‘You fixed

      thus clock-( 0) I fix -(t)
      ‘I fix the clock like this.’

corresponding imperative:

14.3.3 Hortatives with majo and métsu ‘let’s go’The words maho (m a jo ) ‘let’s (du.in.)!’ and métehm (m é ts u ) ‘let’s (pl in.)!’
are inherently imperative verbs (bearing high-low tone). They may be
used by themselves, in which case they mean ‘Let’s go!’, or they may have a
complement. The verb o f the complement verb is preceded by the pronom­
inal proclitic me ‘ SAP’ and may be followed by -(L)khi ‘purpose’. If the com-
plement’s verb is clause final, -© khi normally occurs, as in 908 and 909.
If, however, it is clause medial, /khi/ is normally absent, although its low
tone is still docked on the preceding syllable (unless blocked by another
low tone), as in 910. The complement’s verb always bears high tone on its
first syllable because it is subordinate; this tone is not overridden by the
low tone of -©kM, as in 908 and 910.

Chapter 10Case and Grammatical
RelationsCase marking suffixes indicate the role o f a noun phrase (or subordinate
clause) with respect to the clause within which it occurs. Bora has the
following case markers: -0 ‘nominative’ for subjects ( 10.1), -khe ~ 0 (with
animate and inanimate phrases, respectively) ‘direct object’ ( 10.2),
‘goal’ or ‘theme’ (10.3), -thm ‘source’ (10.4), -fi ‘inanimate obliques’ (10.5),
-ma ‘with’ (10.6), and -$i:?è ‘motive’ (10.7). In addition to these, there are
two “ pseudo-cases”: -?tm ‘comparative’ (10.8) and -x ‘vocative’ (10.9).
    Some of the case-marking alternatives are illustrated in 625. 625a has
a singular transitive verb whereas 625b-d have an intransitive verb.

10.1        SubjectSubjects are not marked for case; that is, the nominative is unmarked. (An
exception is discussed below.) Subjects are recognized by the absence of
another case marker, by their position in the sentence, or by the classifier
suffixed to the verb.
   There are three possible patterns for the subject and predicate, as rep­
resented in 626a, b, and d:(626) a.    ( N   P sub je c t)     [p r e d ic a te       '   '         ^ (j)      b *   [p r e d ic a te   . . . V e r b ] - c l a s s i f i e r s u b je c t   (   @ N P s u b je c t )      c.    NPsubject [predicate •**verb]-[classifiersubject]

First, as represented in 626a, the subject may be a noun phrase preceding
the verb, as in as in 627-629. In this case the verb is followed by - © 0 ? ï
(t) or, when negative, by -(00 nG (n) as ïn 837, page 326. This order is
the one most commonly used to introducé a referent into the discourse.","[300, 301, 302]"

Early Attachment. The analyses (given at the foot of the page) generally
favor early attachment. For example, the sentence in 1194a could be
analyzed either as in 1194b or as in 1194c:
(1194) a. ... baajurf me thtune mé nijtyuhi
      b. ...[[manioc we peel] we wash]
      c. ... [manioc [we peel] we wash]        b. ‘after having peeled the manioc, we wash it’
        c. ‘after having peeled it, we wash the manioc’                        ©2012 SIL International ®
476                                            APPENDIX G. BORA TEXTS
In 1194b, the direct object ‘manioc’ is attached to the verb ‘we peel’ and
then this phrase is attached t o ‘we wash’. ; hence [[DO s-V] s-V]. In 1194c,
on the other hand, the attachment of ‘manioc’ is deferred until ‘we peel
(it)’ has been attached to ‘we wash’; hence [DO [s-V s-V]].","[508, 509, 510]"
"13.1      Negation with adjectives-thm (-tu) ‘neg’ may be added to adjectives (o f which there are very few)
to derive the opposite sense, e.g., i?tehmthm ‘strong’ is derived from i?tehm
‘weak’. Other examples follow; in 835a and 836 the tone is high on -thm
‘neg’ because the adjective is used as a predicate.(835) a. Im ftyu difbye.
      b. Im ityu n é m één u d f(n e).
      a. imi-tjhm ti-:piè            ‘He is bad.’

13.2      Simple negation in finite clausesA finite verb or predicate complement is negated by placing high tone on
its first syllable and suffixing -© thm-ne (-tune) ‘negative-(n)’ or simply
-© thm. (-tu). We will first discuss cases with preverbal subjects and then
those with postverbal subjects.","[359, 360]"

13.3.1     -jt+va with verbsWith verbs, -hi:(§a) ‘deny’ imposes a low tone on its host’s final syl­
lable. Further, the host’s initial syllable must bear high tone (in the
same way as -© thm ‘neg’; see section 3.10.) Thus, the form for verbs
is: # @ ...- © h i:(a ).
   When someone is accused o f doing something bad, he can emphatically
deny this by saying:
(848) o me:nm-:pè-hi:§a (0 méénuubej++va.) ‘I did NO T do it!’
      I do-(SgM)-deny
Note that— contrary to the PREVERBAL SUBJECT CONSTRAINT, page
129)— there seem to be two subjects in 848: the preverbal o ‘I’ and the
postverbal classifier -©:pe (SgM). However, this is not the case if its
structure is as in 849, where the clause is subordinate:
(849) [o mernra ]-:pè   [v hi:§a ]
       I do      -(SgM)    deny
This structure not only resolves the conflict with the PREVERBAL SUBJECT
CONSTRAINT, it also accounts for the verb’s initial high tone (since the
initial syllable o f the verb o f a subordinate clause always bears a high
tone).
    The question in 850a could be answered by either 850b or c. The
difference is that 850b is more emphatic than 850c:
(850) a. iA tsuuca dftyaaba majchójucóó?
      b. Tsahai; majchóllej++va.
      c. Tsahai dille majchotune.      a. a tehm:kha ti   (    tjha:pa max$hó-hmkhó:
         yh already your      wife eat-now      b. teha?a-i; max$hó-$è-hi:§a
         not-PT eat-(SgF)-deny      c. teha?a-i ti-^è    max$ho-thm-nè
         not-PT that-(SgF) eat-neg-(n)      a. ‘Has your wife already eaten?’
      b. ‘Not yet; she has not eaten.’
      c. ‘ She has not yet eaten.’
   Likewise, the first sentence in 851 may be followed by either 851a or
851b; the former is more emphatic than the latter:                             ©2012 SIL International ®

17.2.2        Counterfactual conditional clausesCounterfactual conditional clauses are formed with -kh®a (-ca) ‘if
(contrary-to-fact)’ (CF). Their underlying assumptions are: (1) the truth of
the main clause depends crucially3 on the truth o f the conditional clause,
(2) the conditional clause is false, and (3) therefore the main clause is
false.
    The verb of the main clause always bears -i ‘future’ and -ra ~ -ro ‘frus­
trative, contraexpectation’.4 For example:
(974) U majchoca tsuuca u ts+jpanuiyahi.
        [m maxtfho 1-kha tehm:kha m tehixphanm-i-ja-?i
         you eat       -CF already you be.strong-fut-frs-(t)

       ‘If you had not eaten that, you would not have taken ill.’(976) lA ca iiïmütuca meke p+aabóiyóne?

       SAP-objAn help-fut-frs-(0)
       ‘If it were not savory, would it help us?’   Note that the order of the main and subordinate clauses is reversed in
977:
   3This is generally a causal dependence.
   4This requirem ent— that the main verb bear both the future and the frustrative (contra­
expectation) suffixes— negates the future possibility o f the event o f the main clause, thereby
givin g the counterfactual meaning.","[405, 406]"
"2.5       ApocopeMany morphemes apocopate one or more syllables sentence medially, the
full form being used sentence finally. Among these are the following: -
$i:-(?jè) ‘motive’ (compare 733 and 1051) with 734), -naa(akha) ‘while’,
-ax$hi:(hjm) ‘i f ’, -hi:(§a) ‘deny’, and -kpm(m) ‘very’.
   Some morphemes are shortened even more. For example, when not
phrase final, -?aha (-haja) ‘challenge veracity’ may apocopate to -? as in
54a, -?a:kha (-haaca) ‘capitulation’ to -? as in 54b, and so forth:

         kpa(?)   (wa)        JThe suffix -thm ‘ source’ is sometimes omitted following -(?)ti ‘animate’; see
examples 651b, 674, 673, 679, 690, and 699.
   The suffix -ne (n) is sometimes omitted following -thm ‘negative’; see
section 13.2 (especially examples 838 and 840).
    The segmental portion of thesuffix -©kM ‘purpose’ is sometimes omit­
ted, as in 969, 908, 909, and1006. In such cases the preceding two sylla­
bles usually bear high and low tones (respectively) because the low tone
imposed by -©kM on the final syllable forces the penult to bear high tone
so as to not violate the *LLX constraint assuming the presence o f syllable
corresponding to -(©khi. However, this is not always the case for reasons
discussed in chapter 3.",[76]

    To this point we have not discussed -ne’s tonal properties. -ne (event)
seems to ( 1) impose a high tone on the host’s initial syllable and ( 2) delink
low tones between itself and the initial syllable, thereby making them high:
# @ ...-hne. However, it is not necessary to specify that -ne imposes the
initial high tone provided we recognize that the main verbs o f all sub­
ordinate clauses bear high tones on their first syllables, as indicated by
# @ ...-hne ‘subordinate’ in the tone derivation of i kpa:hakhm-hmkhó:-nè
in figure 16.6. Further, note that the low tone borne by -juco (:) ‘now’
is delinked but not the © that it imposes on the host’s penult. (Unfortu-
nately, at this point we can not say which low tones -ne (event) fails to
delink.)                 i             wa:jacu      to know                                | L_._juco:        now

           self eat -(event) go-now-(SgM) he goes now.’
Is there any sense in which the sensory verb complement in 963a is less an
event than the adverbial clauses in 963b and c? (Here tone does not help
because the verb is too short.) The generalization seems to be this: When
a subordinate clause is headed by -ne and is a direct object, then this -ne is
- © ©ne (0). This—we assume— is the result o f subcategorization; that is,
verbs like axtjhmmi ‘see’ in 963a subcategorize for a complement headed
by - © ©ne (0). If this is correct, the tone difference is due to a syntactic
condition, not a semantic difference.
    Returning now to the -ne (n) that follows -© thm ‘negative’ (mentioned
at the very start of this section), it may be desirable to identify this with
- © ©ne (0). There are two reasons. First, the tone is consistent; indeed
the © imposed by -thm may actually be the © imposed by - © ©ne (0).
Second, this is consistent with the suggestion that negative clauses are
subordinate clauses.","[399, 400, 401]"

3.10.3    Suffixes affecting both initial and final tonesSome suffixes affect the host’s initial and final syllables.   Thus, the suf­

syllable, as in the previous section, as well as a low tone on the syllable

Example 91a results from FLTS, 91b results by the addition of the classi­
fier -©ra (spherical), and 91c results by the subsequent addition o f the
pluralizer -:ne ‘plln’:
(91) a. kha:thmm      (caatuu)    ‘sweet potatoes (collective)’
    b. kha:thm-m     (caatuu)    ‘sweet potato (singular)’
    c. kha:thm-m-:nè (caatuuune) ‘sweet potatoes (plural)’
3.8     The interaction of tone and vowel lengthThe tone bearing unit ( t b u ) is the syllable, not the mora. The basic tone-
assignment rules are blind to vowel length; they deal with syllables, not
moras:
1. They do not assign tone to a mora that is not a syllable.
2. Syllables are treated as adjacent (e.g., by the *LLX constraint) even if
   a mora intervenes. For example, consider the tone derivation o f mé:m-
   :§jè-:pè in figure 3.18:

   as adjacent to the © that -©:§e docks on the end o f me:ni even though
   a mora (length) intervenes between them; this is clear because the first
   of these is delinked to meet the *LLX constraint. Note that in the deriva­
   tion delinking is represented by “ = ” (equal sign). (For further discus-
   sion o f delinking, see section 3.11.2.)
   Likewise, see the second derivation of figure 3.28, page 86. The mora of
   the (SgM) suffix does not count as a tone bearing unit standing between
   the © s o f the (SgM) and negative suffixes. That is, these two © s are
   adjacent.
    There is one— and only one— allophonic (“implementation”) rule that
links vowel length and tone, namely the phenomenon captured by PLTS
discussed in section 3.7.1. (FLTS is another potential candidate, but does
not seem to require that the final syllable be long.)                       ©2012 SIL International ®

3.9        The tones of isolated words ( “citation
           forms”)The tones with which words are cited, that is, spoken in isolation, are often
different than the tones they bear when used in a context. For example, to
speak about a verb, the nonfinite form (see 4.1, page 100) must be used.
   Theoretically, bisyllabic words might have the following tones: HH,
HL LH, or LL. All may occur in the context o f a sentence, but in isolation
bisyllabic words are only LL;18 for example, khmni ‘ arrowroot’, kpaxphi
‘man’, thaxkhm ‘agouti’, no?kho ‘ stork’, max$ho ‘eat, food’, titjhè ‘they (AnPl).
  Theoretically, trisyllabic words might have the following tones: HHH,
HHL, HLH, HLL, LHH, LHL, LLH or LLL:
1. LLL and LLH a re im p o s s ib le becau se th e y v io la t e th e *LLX constraint.
2. HLH, LHH, and HHH do not occur in isolation because the final syllable
   would become low by FDLT. The first two would become HLL and LHL,
   respectively. The last would become HHL, which would then become
   HHL.H by FLTS.
3. Words with HHL tones undergo FLTS, becoming HHL.H; for example,
   amanaa ‘porpoise’, khana:naa ‘salt’.
4. The remaining two possibilities occur: HLL (e.g., m:§mkpa ‘deer’,
     mmï?è ‘field’) and LHL (e.g., kpaxkhó?è ‘flowering plant’).","[108, 109, 110]"

   Another case is that o f mï-nè transport-(0) ‘canoe’. By itself, the root
   mi- does not refer to a canoe; rather, it means quite generally ‘trans­
   portation’. However, it does refer to a canoe when combined with -nè
   (0), which (1) satisfies the structural requirement for a head, and (2) de­
   notes a class o f objects, thus enabling the phrase to refer.12
5. It might be possible to formulate an argument against the claim that
   classifiers head their phrases based on the remarkable behavior of clas­
   sifiers with numeral phrases.
   When a numeral phrase is used to quantify a noun, that noun must agree
   in animacy, gender and number. For example, consider 478, page 218.
   The phrase that means ‘six’ ends with an animate, singular, masculine
   classifier because ‘ six’ is literally ‘one from this hand’. When this phrase
   quantifies a noun (phrase), it must agree in animacy, number and gen­
   der. Thus, in ‘six dogs’— contrary to what one might expect— ‘dogs’ is
   marked as singular and masculine. See section 7.7.2 for further discus-
   sion. However, this lends further support for the claim that classifiers
   head their phrases. What matters are the features of the the numeral
   phrase and the noun, which are precisely the features of the classifiers
   with which each ends. That is, the classifiers determine the features of
   their phrase, even though these features do not reflect the semantics of
   the expression.
    To conclude this section (6.3), it should be clear that Bora classifiers
are eminently nominal. Here we have made a stronger claim: that Bora
classifiers are nouns. By doing so, it follows that Bora classifiers should
share the major properties o f nouns: the types o f meanings they encode,
the grammatical functions they may have, their distribution/use, and so
forth. Indeed, they do except that they have a more restricted distribu­
tion than other nouns. And this restricted distribution is due to a simple
property: that they are bound.
    Based on the claim that Bora classifiers are nouns, it seems reasonable
to think that what have been called “ classifiers” in Bora are not really
such, but simply a subclass o f nouns. We will not try to resolve this issue
here because the answer depends on whether one believes in universal
category definitions or that ultimately each category must be defined for
each language.","[221, 222]"

11.2.9       -hde ‘be able’-?te ‘be able’ indicates that its host’s referent is able to do the action indi­
cated by the verb:

phrases share those features by virtue of the classifier -:pè (SgM).
   Numeral phrases and other quantifying phrases work the same way.
For example, in 392 the numeral phrase teha?oxtehi ‘five’ combines with
the classifier -me (AnPl); this combination is followed by the appositive
noun (the animate plural suffixes providing the referential linkage):
(392) Tsahojts+meva wajpiïmu tsaahi.
      teha-?oxtehi-mè-§a    kpaxphi:-mm teha:-?i            ‘Five men
      one-(hand)-(AnPl)-plQ man-plAn come-(t)               come.’
    A subject noun phrase may be appositive to a postverbal subject
classifier:
(393) nè-:pé-§a-a       © [i   © $i:] (neebévaa fllif) ‘said his son’
      say-(SgM)-rpt-rem   self  son   A noun may be in apposition to a pronoun. For example, in 394 tha:
kha:ni ‘my father’ is in apposition to the pronoun a:nm ‘this (SgM)’:
(394) Aanu taacaani tsaahi.
      a:nm      © tha: © kha:ni teha:-?i          ‘This, my father, comes.’
      this(SgM)   my     father comes-(t)
    A demonstrative adjective is made a demonstrative pronoun by the
addition of a classifier. The noun it modifies is structurally appositive to
it.
(395)ti:-piè    © pï:rmmm-hï (diibye b++rumuj+) ‘that (SgM) agouti’
     that-(SgM)   agouti-sg

A classifier often provides the referential linkage that unites the parts, as
in 397:

Why is Bora so interesting?
The Bora phonology is rich in nonsegmental phenomena. There is an elab-
orate tone system, intimately tied to both the lexicon and the grammar.
(An entire chapter is dedicated to tone, and it is discussed in virtually
every chapter.) Various phenomena are sensitive to syllable weight, and
perhaps conditioned by foot structure.
   Morphologically, Bora is fairly agglutinative. There are many suffixes
and few— if any— prefixes. Many apparent prefixes are proclitics.
    Typologically, Bora is an OV language. Evidence for this claim is as
follows:
1. Both Subject-Object-Verb and Object-Subject-Verb are common
   word orders. Predicate complement clauses generally have Comple-
   ment-Subject-Verb order.
2. There are postpositions, e.g., in the locative construction, but no prepo-
   sitions.
3. In the genitive construction the possessor precedes the possessed.
4. Adjectives may precede the nouns they modify but it is more common
   for the modifier to follow the head in an appositive phrase. (This is a
   consequence o f the role played by the classifiers in forming referring
   expressions.)
5. Auxiliary verbs follow the semantically main verb (which is structurally
   subordinate to the auxiliary verb); see, for example, section 4.3.6.
    Bora has a strong case system implemented by suffixes. There is an
interesting animacy-controlled inversion o f the direct object and recipient
(goal).
     Perhaps the most outstanding feature of Bora grammar is the presence
o f a large number of classifiers and the various ways they are exploited in
carrying out reference. Strikingly, apposition— not constituency— is the
primary “ glue” for creating referring expressions.
   In forming discourses, Bora has a remarkable system o f sentential con­
nectives, one that exploits the classifiers to provide great intersentential
cohesion.",[27]

Chapter 3ToneTone plays a major role in the Bora language. (One indication o f this is that
messages can be communicated by beating the tones on large hollow-log
drums; see section 1.8.) There are minimal pairs showing that tone may
be the only difference between lexical items or grammatical constructions.
For example, the only difference between 66a and b is in the tone o f the
first syllable. (Note: in the Bora writing system, high tone is written as an
acute accent, while low tone is not written.)
(66) a. a:-nè max$ho-:pè (Aane majchoóbe.)    ‘He atethat.’
     b. a:-nè max$ho-:pè (Aane majchoóbe.) ‘Then he ate.’
The only difference between 67a and b is in the tone of the second syllable:
(67) a. a:nm o:?i:piè (aanu oohnbye) ‘This one (SgM) is a dog.’
     b. a:nm o:?i:piè (aanu oohnbye) ‘his dog’
Further consider imi ‘good’, cited here in the nonfinite form with two low
tones. When it occurs as the head of a genitive construction, as in 68, it
bears high-low tones:(68) ti-ip’e    imi (dnbye fmi) ‘his goodness’
     that-(SgM} good
When it is a predicate adjective, as in 69, it bears high tone on both
syllables:
(69)im i oó (Im f oó.)     ‘ la m good.’ or
    good I                 ‘ I am in good health.’
When it is a verb, its tones vary depending on what suffixes follow; com-
pare 70a and 70b:                         ©2012 SIL International ®

     b. ïmi-ip’è        (Imifbye.)     ‘He is good.’ or
          be.good-(SgM}                ‘He is in good health.’
    Note that the penultimate vowel o f 70b is given as a single long vowel
in the morphemic form but as if (bisyllabic1) according to the Bora writing
system, which more closely represents the spoken form. The difference is
due to the application of PLTS, a rule discussed in section 3.7.1. This
convention is followed throughout this grammar.
      Likewise, when verbs are cited, the tones o f the morphemic form and
the orthographic form may differ, as for example i?§èthe (thvéte) ‘to stop
doing’. The first representation shows the morphemic tone (here a single
lexically marked tone on the second syllable) while the orthographic form
is how the word would be pronounced in isolation (the result o f imposing
the nonfinite low tone on the antepenult; see section 4.1).","[87, 88, 89, 90]"

The morpheme - © © ? (i) (t) is suffixed to the verb o f the main clause, as
in 229:

        self house self fix-pur
        ‘The chief told his people to fix his9 house.’This suffix occurs only with explicit preverbal subjects, as in 230a. It does
not co-occur with a classifier subject, as in the first alternative in 230b:
(230) a. ï:hm mmï§a-?i (I+ju um+va.) ‘The horse escaped.’
         horse escape-(t)              *mmi§a-:pé-?i             I

                escape-(SgM)Nor does it occur in negative clauses; such cases are discussed in the next
section.
    The suffix - © © ? (i) (t) imposes a low tone on its host’s penult:(231) a. ó $e:né-?i (ó lleen éh i) ‘I eat (fruit).’
        b. ó i?§èthé-?i (ó th v e té h i) ‘I stop.’     8A theory that entertains some notion o f m ovem ent m ight consider (t) and (n ) to be
“ tracés” o f subjects that have been m oved to a preverbal position. This could be m otivated
by the follo w in g distributional facts: (1 ) (t) and (n ) never co-occur w ith a classifier subject,
presumably because they occupy the position o f classifier subjects, and (2 ) (t) and (n ) occur
i f and on ly i f there is an overt preverbal subject (pronoun, name, or noun phrase).
    9This could also refer to “ their” house, i.e., it could be bound by the indirect object rather
than the subject o f the higher clause. The interpretation given in 229 is preferred because
‘house’ is singular. If, how ever, the object w ere plural, that is i ’ Wa ?apè (s e lf house various)
‘his/their various houses’, then the favored interpretation w ou ld be ‘ their houses’ .","[164, 165]"

222                                         CHAPTER 7. NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES
   Although imia ‘proper’ stands in a genitive relationship with the noun it
modifies, the same is not true of other “ adjectives.” For example, compare
485a with the ungrammatical phrase in 489.21(489)*im i nrn-xphakjho   (fmf nujpacyo)‘good water’
      good water-(liquid)
7.8.1.2      mftyane ‘much’We now come to the third apparent counter-example, that of figure 7.2d.
The modifier mitjhanè (mftyane) ‘much’ precedes the noun (phrase) it
modifies, as in 490a where it appears to modify mi ammnaa ‘people’. How­
ever, we claim that the two words are not in a modifier-head relationship,
but appositive, just as (more obviously) when the first word is headed by
-me (AnPl), as in 490b.22
(490) a. mftyane m+amunaa
       b. mftyame m+amunaa       mitjha f ' ((^ ,, 1 © m i a mmnaa ‘many people’
              , b. -mè (AnPl) ,             ,
       man^ ^                 ;     SAP peopleWe understand this as follows. In 490b mitjhamè would usually suffice
to refer to “ many people” because people are generally more topical than
other collections o f animate beings. Therefore 490b is a rather strange
way to refer to “ many people” (perhaps being reserved for cases o f repair,
where midstream the speaker realizes that the hearer needs clarification,
so adds miammnaa ‘people’).
    By contrast, in 490a the notions o f “ many” and “people” are spread
over two words, each o f which is really a noun phrase in its own right.
The first refers to “ many” objects from the maximally unconstrained set
established by -ne (0); the second word is required to refer to “ people”. The
point is that the notions o f “ many” and “ people” are linked only through
the structural mechanism o f apposition, where -ne (0) plays a semantically
vacuous but structurally crucial role.23
  21One may say the follow in g, using apposition as described in section 7.8.1.2:
      fmf-^é        @ nm-xp1ak:ilö         ‘good w ater’
      g o o d -(0 )   w a ter-(liqu id)
Or one may say the follow in g, using a predicate adjective construction:
      imi nm-xp1ak:ilö            ‘The water is good.’
      good w a ter-(liqu id)  224 90a is m ore com mon than 490b. It may initiate a sentence whereas 490b m ay not.
  23A further exam ple from the translation o f the N e w Testament into Bora follows:

   The following example illustrates the same phenomenon but with
phè§é-nè ‘ordinary’:

7.8.2     Qualifier phrasesBound adjectival stems combine with classifiers to form:
• pronouns (see chapter 8),
• numeral phrases (see section 7.7),
• sentence-initial thematic connectives (see section 19.1), and
• qualifier phrases, now to be discussed.
Qualifier phrases characterize persons, animals, or things. They are
formed by combining an adjectival root (either free or bound) with a clas­
sifier, and are animate or inanimate according to the classifier used. Be­
cause the classifier heads the phrase, these are actually noun phrases; we
will nonetheless refer to them as “ qualifiers” or “ adjectives”. Qualifier
phrases may occur with or without an accompanying noun.","[255, 256, 257]"

3.12.3 The default tone of nouns and classifiersOrdinarily a noun— including its derivational and infiectional suf­
fixes— ends in two low tones. (This is not true for verbs, which end in a
single low tone.) For example, consider kpaxphi ‘man’ and ni:§mkpa ‘deer’
in 120:

    A floating low tone occurs at the boundary between a classifier and its
host (that is, the morpheme to which it is attached). This tone is docked
by the following rule: (1) Monosyllabic classifiers doek a low tone on their
host’s final syllable. (2) Bisyllabic classifiers doek a low tone on the final
syllable o f a polysyllabic host. After a monosyllabic host, the low tone
docks on the classifier’s initial syllable. (3) Classifiers having more than
two syllables bear the low tone on their initial syllable. See section 6.1.4
for further details.","[127, 128, 129]"
"5.1      Basic sentence structureThe basic clause has a subject and a predicate, and the subject precedes
the predicate. For example, in 209 the subject is the noun phrase o:?i:piè
‘dog’ and the predicate is the verb teï:nè ‘run’:(209) (3:?i-:pié      teï:né-?i (O ohn bye ds+tnéhi.) ‘The d og runs.’

   A clause may contain many other phrases, the order of which may vary
considerably. (This word-order flexibility is undoubtedly due to Bora’s
healthy case system.)
   When the subject is an overt, preverbal pronoun, if it is either first or
second person and either dual or plural, then the verb bears the proclitic
me ~ ma1 ‘nonsingular speech-act participants’, which will be glossed SAP.
For example, in 211 the subject is first person plural exclusive (that is, it
does not include the hearer); in both the conditional and the main clause
the verb bears me ‘ SAP’:

lable. Suffixes are attached cyclically: [[[root -suffix] -suffix] -suffix]....
With the addition o f each suffix, the host’s tones may be modified by the
suffix’s tones. This is illustrated in the tone derivations of max$ho-thé-mè-
§ax, mmè?é-:nè-?apè, and m:§mkpa-m§m-ma in figure 3.6. (The under-
score ties a tone to the suffix that imposes it, whether on the host’s final
or penultimate syllable.)   majcho       to eat                    umehe          tree                    ni:vuwa           deer

     Note how the cyclical addition o f suffixes affects the tone:
1. The (l) o f -©teho (-tso) ‘causative’ is blocked by the root’s lexically
   marked low tone. (In figure 3.7 the lexically marked low tone is indi­
   cated by “ L” followed by “lexical.” Blocking is indicated by “ + ” on the
   line connecting the root’s final vowel and the L brought by -©teho.)
2. The © of -© the ‘go to do’ docks on the host’s final syllable. The © of
   -©teho does not block the © o f -© t1^ because the © of -©teho has not
   docked (as just explained).
3. The © o f -© fo ‘frustrative, contraexpectation’ is blocked by the © of
   -(L)the.
4. The © o f -©:pe (SgM) docks. The © of -© fo does not block it because
   it is not docked.
If floating tones are not associated on the cycle in which their morpheme
is attached, they are never associated.
   Strong evidence for cyclical tone adjustment can be seen in the second
derivation of figure 3.28, page 86: the © o f - © © § a ‘come to do’ may
not doek because o f the root’s lexically marked low on the initial syllable:
a:?ije ‘visit’. However, the root’s low tone is subsequently delinked by the
negative suffix and ends up bearing high tone.","[96, 97, 98]"
"15.1        Yes/no questionsYes/no questions are formed from indicative sentences by starting them
with a ‘yes/no’,1 as in 921 and 922. (See also example 955, page 361.)

      a^iéhm-:pè $i:paha-thé-?i                                          ‘A/The chief went to hunt.’

      many-(0) people     come-(t)
In 629 the subject is a relative clause headed by the classifier -O^ps (SgM):
(629) Llffn a ja atééb é mujtahi.
      [NP 0i ^i:paha:-thé ]-:péj  mraxtha-?i
               hunt-go.do -(SgM) be.lost-(t)
      ‘The one who went to hunt got lost.’
   Second, as represented in 626b, a third person subject may be indicated
by a classifier suffixed to the verb. This order is generally used if the                                                       ©2012 SIL International ®
10.1. SUBJECT                                                                                269
subject has been previously introduced into the discourse. For example,
in 630 the subject is the classifier - 0 :PG( _;be) (SgM):1
(630) $i:paha:-thé-épè  (Llffnajaatéébe.) ‘He went to hunt.’
      hunt-go.do- (SgM)
   A classifier subject may be followed by an appositive subject noun
phrase, as in 631:
(631) “ Juuju” neebévaa fllif.
        “ hm:hm” nè-:pé-§a-a       <0 1^11                        ‘ “ OK,” said his son.
          OK     say-(SgM)-rpt-rem     his.son
    Every clause must have a subject. If there is no classifier on the verb,
there must be a preverbal subject.2 Further, as in 626c, preverbal sub­
jects do not co-occur with classifier subjects;3 see the preverbal subject
constraint discussed on page 129.
   Third, as represented in 626d, if the predicate is a noun or adjective
phrase, the subject usually follows the predicate, as in 632:
(632 )né?m(?) hm:§a (...néhnfjuuva) ‘ ...it is a bad trail.’
      bad     trail
   We mentioned above that there was one exception to the claim that
the nominative case is unmarked. As stated in section 8.1, when a per­
sonal pronoun is used as a preverbal subject, if it has a long vowel, this is
shortened. For example, ti-:piè tip’è, as in 633:
(633)            Tsa dibye pééityu.
        teha? ti-piè   phé:-i-tjhm              ‘He does not go.’
        not that-(SgM) go-fut-neg
This also applies in subordinate clauses, as in 634. (See also 864, page
332.)
(634) Dille téhullévu péhajchff ó imfllé dffllema o pééneé.
      [ti-^è      thé-?m$é-§m       phé-?ax^hi:]
       that-(SgF) that-(place)-goal go-if        ó imi$é-? [ti:-$è-ma         o phé:-nèé]
        I want-(t) that-(SgF)-with I go-(n)
        ‘If she goes over there, I want to go with her.’   1The tone o f -(T):pè (S gM ) is blocked b y the lo w im posed b y -(C)t1E ‘go to do’ .
   2This is true in both main and subordinate clauses, although it may be that in cases o f
relativization into the subject, like exam ple 629, the subject is not overt in the m odifying
clause.
  3W e mean, o f course, except for -?i (t) or -ns (n ) fillin g the postverbal subject position

"3.12         Grammatical toneTone plays a major role in Bora grammar. Here we mention tone patterns
associated with particular grammatical structures.
1. The tone of the genitive constructions, discussed in section 9.1.
2. There are distinctive tones on imperative verbs. Two basic generaliza-
   tions regarding these are:
   (a) The imperative verb— including the pronominal prefix or pro­
       clitic— bears a low tone on the second syllable.
   (b) The verb stem bears a low tone regressive to the antepenult:
         ... ct( ü( ü) ) # (just as for nonfinite verbs). This delinks conflicting
         lexically marked tones.
     For more details about imperatives, see section 14.1.1.
 27There is some evidence that bumping also applies to - r e ‘o n ly’ .",[122]

   ily delink the low imposed by that classifier on the preceding noun,
   e.g., mmé?è-kpa-tm (tree-(slab)-like) ‘like a slab-like thing’. Even if
   that monosyllabic classifier’s O is blocked, the O ° f -((tm may fail
   to doek, as though that classifier’s O were present: kpaxkhó-?é-tm
   (fiower-(tre^-like) ‘like a flowering tree’.
2- - ( ( O (?)ta)m ‘likeness, similarity, comparative (like)’ [Vsuborfinate/Ncase,

   ple, figure 3.27, page 85, shows that - O O tm ( _du) ‘like’ can delink the
   O o f -(L)m§m (-u vu ) ‘maximal’.
   The tones o f the host depend on the number of syllables. The initial
   tone is always high because the verb is subordinate (indicated ü). Hosts
   with more than two syllables bear the suffix-imposed O on the penult.","[456, 457, 458]"
