 Besides   its predicate                              negation              use,  its most common use is in the

The negative particle aar is only mentioned by Lehman
                                                      n (ar                                                           in his

aar negates

                             verbal predicates, too.  In example   (42a)  it appears
to be just               a     variant form of the contemporary  negative   particle
aa, while its use                            in imperative sentences shown in example
demonstrates                                                                            (42b)

that it is not clear whether the initial                                                   y- is to be interpreted

There  are many forms    of negation  in Rama,   some   free, some bound;
some  preceding   the  element  they negate,   some   following   it.   The
analysis  and inventory of the forms and their use varies         somewhat
from Lehmann   (1914),  to Conzemius   (1927),  to the present research
with contemporary speakers.","[188, 189]"

characteristic.   Linked                        to this nominal                    characteristic               is the fact
that   the              verb         forms    negated    with    tahma/taama    usually                                 appear
without    a            tense         marker,    as  shown    in examples    (43,44,45)                                 above.
This     is       found         in     the     data        collected         on     contemporary                Rama    and   is
described   in Conzemius    too.     Lehmann, on the other hand,   stated
that the negative taama       was always followed by a tense marker.

Out      of        the      many          examples           of     negation               collected         recently,       there
were         only two                instances        of the combination                           negation     +   tense,     and

This   negative   particle   taama/tahma   may  be  divided  into  two
morphemes tah/taa and ma.      Evidence for this bimorphemic analysis
is   found  in the   occasional   use  of the morpheme   -ma alone  in
contemporary Rama, as a negative existential predicate:
(51)               siiru       ma                        :                           / siiru        kliin

 Today,              negative             possession                 is         likely       to            be     expressed         with      a
 negated             form     of        the       verb,     for           example,          kwaakar,              as    in:

 This  means  that    there   are three ways   of saying   'I don't

Although Conzemius did not mention the existence of an aar nega-
tion marker,  he is the only one to have claimed the existence of
a future negative marker aarna,   in which  the negative particle
aar can easily be identified.2.3.     tahma,          taama

negative form found in all three sources of information on Rama.

carrying         the TAM information)     as tenseless     (as seen in the above
example).          The  tenselessness   of   the   verb  extends   to  the  future
negative construction                     marked        by     a    negative            word        arna       which        only
he claimed existed in                    Rama:

"Although    Lehmann gave a different   form for  ‘cannot',  he  most
likely   did not have the correct  analysis of the  form he listed.
The word aaningka which he claimed to be a ‘helping verb' meaning
‘cannot' turns out to be, in contemporary Rama, the                                                     negative form
of the quantifier ningka 'plenty, enough', which he                                                     listed as the.

 2.7.     Conclusion
 The      topic       of         negation           in      Rama        is     an     interesting            one        which
deserves   further                 study.  There                 are a great variety   of forms,    but
their  actual   use                has not been                 completely  established yet.     [It is
also one of the                   few areas of grammar for which there is earlier
documentation.                   A thorough study of the negation forms found in
natural        speech,            such    as        narratives,              remains        to   be    done.       Another
topic to be researched     is the possible                                          influence of the contact
language,  Creole English,    on the use of                                         these negative morphemes
in the Rama of today.","[200, 201]"

2.5.    Negative         imperative:            arka
This    negative          marker        was     already            presented            in    the        discussion           of
imperative         earlier        in     this     chapter.           arka        is     a    free        morpheme           used
preverbally,         often        in    clause         initial        position:

 arka    is     most     likely     a     compound      of     two      morphemes               ar-ka.           The    first
 morpheme           resembles       the     ar      negative         marker         mentioned               by     Lehmann
 and the first part of the putative future negative marker arma of
 Conzemius.     The -ka segment is also found in angka,  the negative
 modal   'cannot'   presented  below. The ka resembles  the ablative
 postposition ka. 2.6.    angka
Neither        Lehmann        nor   Conzemius         list     angka.          It        is    a    model        with    the
negative            meaning     'cannot'          (pronounced           kyan        in        creole)       used        very
frequently  in            the   speech  of contemporary   Rama                            speakers.  It is a
free  morpheme              used   preverbally,   and   often                             in  clause-initial

to convey the meaning of 'can' (see section on modals in chapter
9 on tense~aspect-modality).","[199, 200]"

3.4.      Derived    adjectives         with    -tahmaThis negative   suffix is the semantic  opposite                             of the suffix       -wa,
meaning  'without',  corresponding to the ‘suffix                             '-less'.  It,      too,
derives      adjectives  from  nouns in a highly   productive                                 manner,
although     it is for pragmatic reasons rare in texts:

positive one              in Rama.   Examples                     are:

             NEG bad   =                good/well
It is not            clear how much negative adjectives   can be considered
the result           of derivation or are figures of speech favored by Rama
speakers.","[80, 81]"

There  is a general    semantic    shift   from postposition to verbal
prefix   which manifests    itself     slightly  differently with each
postposition,  although always      in the same direction of semantic
bleaching.","[136, 137]"

The     consolidation             of    the     mainland     Ramas    at     Cane        Creek        works       both

language.    On the positive  side, it means                               that more speakers                       are
now concentrated   in one location,   where they form a more viable
linguistic  community,   since almost   half of the people  of Cane
Creek are fluent speakers  (16 out                           of 29).     On the negative    side,
this   concentration  also  means                            more    use   of  Creole    in    the
interaction with the non-speakers                           and more exposure to Creole for
the     children      of    the        Rama     speakers.","[26, 27]"

 It     is    not     entirely            clear     whether            this    morpheme            belongs       to        this
subset of aspect markers.   If it is a single morpheme sai,    it is
different morphologically  from the other aspects    of this set in
that it does not have a tense marker.    Its inclusion in this set
of     aspectual               markers     would        be    based     on    the        fact    that    it   expresses
adverbial            semantic            notions        complementary               to     the    semantics       of        the

that it        would constitute a homogeneous morphological set with the
others.          However, sai could be analyzed as sa-i,   with a present
tense   marker.     There   is                          no  form  *sa-u,   with    the   past  tense
marker,     although    this                            combination    would    be    pragmatically
unlikely.","[165, 166]"

device   to  mark   what   relative   clauses    have  in   common    with
constructions   expressing   old,  presupposed   information.     One  can
find   discussions   in the  literature  of  the  structural overlap
between relative clause structure and wh-question or clefting and
attempts at explaining why this should be so, by appealing to an
overlap of functional domain.     In some way, this is the Rama way
of doing it.    More subtle but not very different.",[255]

 5.     NEGATION
In the broader sense of the word modality,
                                                one may consider the

The  presence   of  a chapter  on a grammaticalization    process  in a
descriptive grammar of Rama is a trademark of the functional-typ-
ological   approach   of this work.   This  approach  incorporates   the
diachronic   phenomenon   of grammaticalization   as an integral   part
of    the   descriptive             analysis         of        the        language,               in    what        has      been
dubbed   a panchronic   grammar  approach.                                             In     the case               of Rama,
this   approach  offers  the means   to handle                                    an        essential               component
of   the   grammar  of   the  language  which   is its    extensive
morphological interconnection across grammatical structures. 21.    OVERVIEW    OF    RAMA        GRAMMATICALIZATION                     CHAINS
The    previous        chapters        of    this     grammar              have       described            a        number     of
grammaticalization   chains which all involved verbal         morphology.
In some instances,    it involved preverbal morphology,        as was the
case   with  relational     preverbs,    and   in  others   it    involved
postverbal  morphology,    as was    the  case with   subordinators     and
aspect/modality           markers.             The         relevant           data           on        which        the      fol-
lowing      discussion         is    based    can         be    found       in    the        chapters               labelled:
Tense-Aspect-Modality,                       Relational                    Preverbs,                   Subordination,
Complementation           and       Imperatives            & Negation.","[256, 257]"

Therefore,  it should be noted again that                                                    although Rama has many
characteristics of a verb final language,
                                                                                            it is not as absolutely
verb        final        as     Turkish           or     Japanese,             as    the     relative            order      of      main
and        subordinate               clauses           shows.
A     possible           exception               to     the       earlier           statement            that     there       are      no
real        strings            of    embedded            clauses         in        Rama    would         be     the    occasional
sequences           of        embedded           clauses          with        su     ‘upon!:(41)            an-siik-su

Another common property of prototypical clause chaining languages
is  that in  such  languages there  exists no alternative  to the
clause        chaining            construction.               All    complex            sentences       are    made     of
chains        of    non-final             clauses          folowed         by     one        final   clause     with         a
finite verb;   there are no                       co-ranking structures,     in                      which complex
sentences  may    have  more                      than   one finite   verb.                          In   Rama,  the
subordinated    clauses   of                      the  type  discussed    here                        coexist   with
co-ranking          structures,              such     as      the    coordinated               structures      and     one
type     of    subordination                 which       is    marked           with     a    free   subordinating
conjunction             and   a    finite        verb.","[227, 228]"

    is    marked with the complementizer -kama.

 tabi-kama                     'come out! is literally the complement sentence of                                                                sung
 'to see',                     although verbs of perception usually do not take                                                                  this
type of complement clause,      as already mentioned. However,   a -kama
construction    is  typical  of    complement clauses  of  desiderative
verbs.    Hence,   the ~kama of this sentence may indicate that the
combination   sung-iikar is to be taken as one verb word,      with the
second of the two, the desiderative iikar controlling the type of
complement   clause  the  V~-V combination  takes.     It  is  not
immediately  obvious whether this  is an argument  for or against
treating -iikar as a serialized verb or as a modality marker, but
the facts are worth pointing out.",[242]

 corresponds  to   the  encoding   of a    particular component   of    a
 prototypical  imperative  situation:   the fact that imperatives    are
 requests to move or change from one state to another.      Rama is an
 interesting  language in that its grammar encodes  the fact that
 the intended effect of the imperative speech act is the creation
 of a sequence of two actions or states:  a first state or action
 to    be         abandoned           and        moved           away         from    and      a       second           state        or        action
to be embraced       and moved   toward.    While   the serialized motion
verb   bang   marks    the motion    toward  the  desired   new  action  or
state,   there    is also in Rama the possibility of encoding in an
imperative     form the move    away   from the   first  action  or state.
This is done through the use of the relational preverb ka-, from
the         ablative               kang      ‘from',               on     the        imperative               verb.             The        use         of

Rama is          an S O V language. The word order is relatively rigid                                                     and
is   the          basic  syntactic  device  used  for marking  subject                                                     and

Postpositional     phrases                                   can    occur   both    preverbally    and
postverbally.  Since    the                                 postpositional     phrases   often   occur
postverbally, the   language                                 cannot    be typified   as strictly  verb
finaL.  The  function  of                               the   various positions  has                            not   been
analyzed yet, but from a                               cursory inspection of textual                            materials
it appears   that the longer form of the postposition      often occurs
in postverbal    position   and the  shorter  form occurs  preverbally.
When the   longer   form  occurs  preverbally   it could  indicate  left
dislocation   of  the   postpositional  phrase.   Thus                                                    there  are      two

 Linguistic          information                 on    the       Rama        language        is   scarce,     much      more
 so     than   for     the          other        languages              of       the     Coast.     Brinton       (1891),
 Lehmann    (1914, 1920)  and  Conzemius    (1927)  contain   word
 lists. Lehmann has reproduced 21 words that Brinton collected in
 the introduction  of his own word list of 1569 entries which is
 the largest data base available on Rama              (1920).   Lehmann's work is
 an   impressive    tour   de   force,    packed    with    information    gathered
 over   a very   short   period    of time.      Some grammatical      information
 on Rama is found in the two short sketches by Lehmann                  (1920:9-17)
 and    Conzemius     (1927:329-339).        They    cover     roughly    the    same
 topics:     sound     inventory,      basic    noun     and    verb   morphology,
 including    sections    on  so-called      ‘classifiers',      pronouns,    verbal
derivation,   negation, tense markers and numbers.     Lehmann insists
on  finding   traces    of  passives and   Conzemius gives   a list of
phrases   (337-338)   and borrowings   from English, Miskitu,   Spanish
 and    Creole       (339).              There        is    no    text       material         available     in     either

interchangeable.    Examples   below  show both  constructions     in a
subordinate  clause (60)  and with the progressive aspect    (61):

However,   there   might   be a preference  for the aa negation with
certain aspectual modality auxiliaries,       such as the intentional-
bating   ‘want to,    going to'  and the desiderative   iik(a)r  ' want

"In   the    realm  of morphosyntax                         and   syntax   no   obvious    marks   of
internal     language decay  could                        be   observed   through    this   method.
Since    one possible  outcome  of                        language   decay   is the impoverish-
ment of the  inventory of tense/aspect/modality systems,   overall
counts of these inventories were taken in both languages.     They
revealed comparable richness of systems,  with no indication that
the Rama system was more limited in its expressiveness than the
Creole   one.         A     comparison   of the inventory                            of tense/aspect/moda-
lity   markers            of   the  Rama   versions  with                            the  only  sources  of
information available on previous stages                                      of the language  (Lehmann
1920,  Conzemius 1927) yielded a feeling                                      of incompleteness of the
previous grammatical Studies rather than                                      recent loss.
Finally,  since    various  studies                              have   documented the  loss   of
certain types   of subordination    in                           language death situations   (see                                                            2710

various   subordinate    clauses     in Creole    and Rama.     The results     are
given   in Table I above.      There too,    no significant       difference    was
found   between   Creole    and   Rama,    neither    in   the   frequency     with
which   subordinate    clauses    were   used    (27%   in  Creole    and  22%    in
Rama),         nor in the variety of subordinate                                            constructions.                    There-
fore,         contrary  to studies  which showed                                            how  loss   of                  language
functions may correlate with loss of complex sentence structures,
no   equivalent    phenomenon   was  detected  in   the Rama  of   this
speaker.     However,    one  aspect   of  the  syntax  and  discourse
structure of the speech of this speaker may need researching:     it
is  the  observation   that the two   linguistic   systems, English
Creole and Rama,   appear to be converging,   giving the impression
of     parallel          overall        narrative               strategies             and       syntactic            patterns.","[278, 279]"

a        sequence                    of         'past'         (bought)               and          ‘present!               (makes)    .          This

example                  remains                valuable            for         the        combination                of     the      causative
verb with the verb     'to drink':    The issue of what the tense of
the causative   'should'   be in this    coordinated clause where the

 As already           mentioned in chapter 5 on derivational morphology                              some
 adjectives            have  special  forms  to indicate inten-sity. Two                             such
 forms are            mitmali   'very good' and tataara ‘very big'.
 There  do  not   seem to  be genuine                       grammatical              constructions  for
 comparatives   or superlatives.    The                      closest to             the superlative  is
 an    expression        with    the     adjective       aingwa        'real,       true': (4)        kwuerku       taara     aingwa

 complex postposition  uruksu   ‘over'.  Notice the                                   ordering  of   the
adjective and the postposition used to form the comparative

the postposition  precedes   the   adjective   it modifies.    This    is as
marked   ordering which  may    betray   a  non-native   origin    of    the
 construction:

  For Rama   Cay,  the   key  concept   to keep    in mind  is                                                       the    notion    of
  ethnically   associated    language    and   the  fact that                                                       the     goal   need
  not be speaking     fluency   for all,    but knowledge   of                                                      and     about   the
  language.        71     To        this        end,        one    objective               was     to       create         linguistic
  materials        on    the         language              with     the    help        of        the    Cane        Creek       people.
  At  the   request   of  the  Rama  speakers                                              of   the  project,   varius

  songs     and    prayers               for     the        school        and        the     church,           and         an   elemen-
