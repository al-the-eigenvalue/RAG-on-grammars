"294.Unfortunately, main stress placement in the word kawİ was not registered. Here it is
    probably on the first syllable and in the previous example on the second syllable.

on relations of scope:(2776)    Q:     au'Beto-'le    a'wͿi-xa-re
                 Alberto-only see-2-INT
                 ‘you only saw Alberto?’          A:     ay-hͿ-'le        a'wͿi-da-he-'ki
                 that-NOM-only see-1S-NEG-DEC
                 ‘I did not see only him (I saw the other one too)’295In (2776) the subject did see the object Alberto, but not exclusively him. Ap-
parently then, the negative morpheme corrects a presupposition which is pres-
ent in the context of speech. In this case the presupposition to be corrected is
represented by the morpheme -le ‘only’. In the following example -he- seems
to negate -rata:(2777)    xyi-ra'ta        a'wͿi-xa-hͿ-he-ki
          you-first        see-2-NOM-NEG-DEC
          ‘you didn’t see it first (I did)’296
          (lit. ‘it isn’t so that you were the first one to see it’)Also in (2777), the subject did see the object, but he was not the first one to do
so. In the ensuing examples person-negative morpheme order may also be con-
nected with the counter of presuppositions:(2778)    si 'nãi-da-he-ki
          I like-1S-NEG-DEC
          ‘it wasn’t me’297(2779)    tsuhǊ-'du 'cu-da-he-tsy-tse        koreja-'ko
          what-BER cut-1S-NEG-POT-DEC knife-INS
          ‘I can’t cut (down the mahogany tree) with a machete’(2780)    tsuhǊ-'du-tsy-lİ     a-'ta-ta-he-tsy-tse
          what-BER-GER-PREC exist-TRA-1O-NEG-POT-DEC
          ‘what good would it be?, he couldn’t stay together with me’ (t)295.The full expression in Kwaza for ‘I did not only see Alberto, but the other one too’
    does not involve a negative, but a positive extra medial clause.
296.There is no unambiguous way to express: ‘you saw it last’.
297.On one occasion, the consultant MA said that this sentence consists of three words:
    si nãi daheki. This could be an indication that Kwaza is morphologically less com-
    plex than I presume. On the other hand, he said elsewhere that words can occur un-
    finished, and do require to be completed.
524    7. Other morphosyntactic structures(2781)    ute-'ta      duture cari-da-he-'ki=tse
          notify-CSO pig          shoot-1S-NEG-DEC=DEC
          ‘he said he did not kill a pig’298In the negative of the declarative mood, the zero-marked third person does not
cause ambiguity as regards presupposition. In the case of straightforward nega-
tion, the verb is terminated by -he-tse, and in the case of countersupposition by
-he-ki. In (2782) below, the speaker knows that the coffee is not sweet, and in
(2783) the speaker discovers that the coffee is, against his expectations, not
sweet:(2782)    hoi-'he-tse
          sweet-NEG-DEC
          ‘it isn’t sweet’ (speaker warns a hearer who intends to drink)(2783)    'hoi-he-ki
          sweet-NEG-DEC
          ‘it isn’t sweet’ (speaker establishes an unexpected fact)The context in which the next example was elicited represents circumstantial
evidence that it is countersuppositional:(2784)    wai-he-'ki
          good-NEG-DEC
          ‘it doesn’t taste good’This sentence was uttered in reaction to the remark: ‘what a tasty soup you’ve
made!’. A similar situation was observed in the next example:(2785)    'si-dy-hͿ    etohoi-he-'ki
          I-POS-NOM child-NEG-DEC
          ‘he is not my child’ (t)This sentence was uttered by a woman from a mythological story who had be-
come a misandrist and did not even want to recognise her own son any more. If
these examples represent negations of presuppositions, it may be assumed that
the zero-third person morpheme is located before the negator and the mood
marker: -Ø-he-ki.
   In family II, the combination -he-ki with zero-marked third person, seems to
be more common than in family I. The combination -he-ki cited in (5.2.1.1.)
probably indicates countersupposition as well, but more research is needed.
   The contrastive morpheme -hehͿ also has a countersuppositional use. Also
other morphemes such as desiderative -heta- ‘would like’, conjectural -here298.The context is probably that he killed something else.
                                                                     7.1. Negation   525‘think that, but’, -cehere ‘think that maybe’ and -here=jã-re ‘don’t you see!’
have an antithetic connotation. All these morphemes may contain the original
negative morpheme -he-, but because they do not really have a negative value,
they are discussed in the relevant sections of (5.5.).","[560, 561, 562, 563]"

    to be of Kanoê origin.

The negative morpheme is generally inserted in a position before the mood
marker without any further adaptations:(2796)     ja-'he-da-ki
           eat-NEG-1S-DEC
           ‘I did not eat’Questions can be asked in a negative form, and a negative response yields a
logically positive answer:(2797)     Q: mãrİ̘ri'tsa ja-'he-xa-re                  A: hã'?ã (ja)-'he-da-ki
              person       eat-NEG-2-INT                   yes eat-NEG-1S-DEC
              ‘do(n’t) you eat people?’                    ‘no’(2798)     Q: atsile-'re                                A: ha'?ã
              heavy-INT                                    yes
              ‘is it very heavy?’                          ‘yes (it is)’(2799)     Q: atsile-'he-tsy-re                         A: ha'?ã
              heavy-NEG-GER-INT                            yes
              ‘isn’t it very heavy?’                       ‘yes (it isn’t)’    Person-negative order also occurs in the interrogative. It questions a nega-
tive presupposition held by the speaker:(2800)     ƭ-'wã     'rai?ͿhͿ       mã=duhͿ-ty-a-'ni=xa-he-re      ͅrjãwã-'na
           he-AO animal             call=all-DET-1P-EXH=2-NEG-INT forest-LOC
           ‘why don’t you say to him: “let’s count all the names of the animals
           in the forest!”?’303 (t)(2801)     be-tara-'ni-xa-he-re
           ripe-PROC-CAUS-2-NEG-INT
           ‘why don’t you wait for (the fruit) to ripen?’The following example of a countersupposition is formally interrogative, but
not semantically. The interrogative is used emphatically here:
303.Note that the glossing of -ni as exhortative represents a literal interpretation of a con-
    struction that may be also analysed as causational (like in the next example).
528    7. Other morphosyntactic structures(2802)     o'xe-da-he-rai-re         'txarwa o'nİ-wa-hͿ        hary'ky
           smile-1S-NEG-damn-INT first        arrive-IS-NOM now
           ‘I was not happy for nothing, they’ve really arrived’304Emphatic use of the interrogative was discussed in (5.2.2.1.).
    In sections (5.2.7-10.) three special prohibitive moods were identified and
described: negative imperative, negative exhortative and monitory. They form
the respective counterparts to the three persuasive moods imperative, exhorta-
tive causative and volitive.
    Only the negation of the exhortative is transparent in the sense that the
negative marker -he- precedes exhortative -ni. There is a less transparent, non-
discontinuous, negative exhortative -ini, but this has only been attested in rela-
tively fixed expressions. Negative exhortative is discussed in (5.2.8.).
    The negative imperative also contains the identifiable negative marker -he-,
but the mood marker is different: -ky. Even though the negative imperative may
be expressed in a discontinuous way, the element -ky does not occur as a mood
marker without -he- (see 5.2.7.). Only few instances of negation of the impera-
tive as marked by -ra were attested:(2803)     ehͿ-'he-ca-ra            (*ehͿhecaky)
           make-NEG-EMP-IMP
           ‘don’t do that!’305Apparently, the alternative mild imperative which involves the potential marker
-tsy- and which is discussed in (5.2.3.1.) can also be negated with -he-:(2804)     tsuhǊ-'du-xa-lİ    nãi-xa-'he-tsy-tse
           what-BER-2-PREC like-2-NEG-POT-DEC
           ‘you are not going to do thus, because (he is your son)’ (t)   A real negative counterpart of the volitive was not attested. Instead, there is
a monitory mood which was discussed in (5.2.9.). It is marked by monomor-
phemic -tsi, which bears no formal resemblance to the negative morpheme.","[564, 565, 566]"

This is a description of a language. More specifically, this is the first comprehen-
sive documentation and study of the Kwaza language of Brazil. It is based on re-
search and interviews with native speakers between 1995 and 2002 in the
Guaporé region. This book is a corrected and thoroughly revised version of my
doctoral dissertation. Although no description of any language will ever be com-
plete and definitive, I believe nevertheless that the present work provides a repre-
sentative and reliable outline of the language. Even though this book concerns the
indigenous heritage of Brazil, it was for several reasons necessary to publish it in
English. I hope that there will be a Portuguese version one day, that is accessible
to both the indigenous peoples of Rondônia and a wider Brazilian public.
    Without the cooperation of native speakers, I could not have written this
grammar. In this sort of work native language consultants of field researchers
have often been called “informants”. Lately the term “collaborators” has been
proposed because that correctly reflects a more active role in the research on the
part of the consultant, and also because “informants” has developed a pejorative
connotation in certain contexts. However, since “collaborators” has at least as pe-
jorative a connotation in certain other contexts, I have avoided the use of either
one of them. Therefore I refer to the native speakers I worked with as my “con-
sultants” or, where it does not sound awkward, as my “teachers”. Whatever con-
notation these terms may develop in the future, in this book they intend to convey
reference to highly intelligent, kind and active participants in scientific research.

                                                              7.1. Negation   529(2805)   Q: kui-'nã-xa-re                        A: 'he-nã-da-ki
            drink-FUT-2-INT                         NEG-FUT-1S-DEC
            ‘are you going to drink?’               ‘I’m not’(2806)   Q: tomã-'nã-xa-re                       A: he
            bathe-FUT-2-INT                         NEG
            ‘are you going to bathe?’                ‘no!’(2807)   Q: kukui-'re                            A: 'he-tse
            hurt-INT                                NEG-DEC
            ‘is (the pepper) strong?’               ‘no’In other contexts, an answer like 'hetse could mean ‘there isn’t (any)’, ‘he said
no’, etc.
   The occurrence of rootless negation combined with further morphemes in
extraposition functions as a particle which emphasises the negative aspect of a
preceding negative sentence:(2808)   Ǌcenãi-'hͿ-he-ki     'he-tsy-hͿ
         know-NOM-NEG-DEC NEG-GER-NOM
         ‘they don’t know anything’   The same countersuppositionality as discussed in section (7.1.1.2.) can be
expressed in root ellipsis:(2809)   xa-'he-tsy-tse      İ-'ra
         2-NEG-POT-DEC go-IMP
         ‘don’t you persist, go away!’ (t)This example is from a mythological story in which a boy, who presumed
wrongly that he could stay with his mother, is sent away.
    The free occurrence of he'ki ‘no’ probably also negates a presupposition, but
the evidence is only circumstantial. In (8.1.2.1.) it is explained how negation is
not normally adjacent to an interrogative mood marker. However, when it is,
countersupposition is apparently involved. The following example suggests
this:(2810)   he-'re
         NEG-INT
         ‘yes, isn’t it?’
530   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresThis example represents an utterance which confirms a statement. Its non-
countersuppositional variant would be the interrogative equivalent of 'hetse ‘it
isn’t’ and it would inquire about the negation of the omitted root.306
   Since the negative morpheme can occur as a verbal root, it is apparently also
found as root part of a compound. Compare the following examples:(2811)    darje-'he-tja      ojanͿ-'he-tse
          strong-NEG-CSO arrive-NEG-DEC
          ‘because he is weak, he did not come hither’(2812)    darje-'he-tja 'he=ojanͿ-ki
          strong-NEG-CSONEG=arrive-DEC
          ‘because he is weak, he did not come hither’It is possible that the verb root he'?ai- ‘to want not’ originates from ellipsis and
compounding:(2813)    wƭ    he'?ai-xa-re
          wine want.not-2-INT
          ‘you don’t want wine?’Although there is no verbal root *ai-, there are roots which may be historically
related, aitse- ‘to be patient’ and aitsehe- ‘to be lazy’.
    There is one other type of expression in which the negative morpheme is
probably used elliptically:(2814)    i'si-da-nãi-'he
          die-1S-NOM-NEG
          ‘(I’m) not (going to drink more) or else I’ll get drunk’(2815)    ka'je=İ-da-nãi-'he
          crawl=go-1S-NOM-NEG
          ‘(I’m) not (going to drink more) or else I’ll have to crawl’This construction is neither semantically nor grammatically understood very
well, and it is probably idiomatic. Example (2814) was considered as identical
to the following:306.This was created by myself:          he-tsy-'re
          NEG-GER-INT
          ‘is it not?, isn’t it there?, did he say no?’
                                                                  7.1. Negation   531(2816)    isi-nã-ƭ-'tsi
          die-FUT-NEG-MON
          ‘(I’m) not (going to drink more) lest I’ll get drunk’The structure of this latter example is relevant to section (7.1.2.).","[566, 567, 568, 569]"

1.11. Organisation of the present workThis book consists of three parts: a grammar (part I), texts (part II) and a dic-
tionary (part III). It is an attempt to describe the Kwaza language. It neither
follows a specific theoretical model, nor does it examine theoretical implica-
tions of the analysis. Its primary concern is to prevent the Kwaza language
from disappearing without leaving behind representative documentation. The
description is intended to be comprehensive and dependable, so that theoretical
issues can be dealt with in later studies.
    The basic orientation of this grammar is formal rather than functional, that
is, the structure of the present description is determined by the productive
forms of the language and the way they are used, rather than by possible
grammatical functions and the way these are realised by the grammatical sys-
tem. Nevertheless, the sections are not always located where they could be ex-
pected to be on formal grounds. The subsection about classifiers (4.2.) is rele-
vant both for nominal and verbal morphology. Since classification is important
for a complete understanding of attributive modification, numerals and demon-
stratives, I have discussed it prior to these. The subsections which concern ad-
verbial affixes (6.2.4.) have been placed together, because I deemed it conven-
ient to have all adverbial morphology in one place rather than scattered
throughout the book. Finally, the chapter on complex constructions (8.) also
has a basis in verbal morphology. However, since that morphology is charac-
teristic for subordinate clauses, its grammatical domain is greater than that of
the verb alone. Therefore, I have discussed it after the sections on nouns, verbs
and adverbs. The subsections of (8.) together provide a complete account of
subordinate clause formation. If a strictly formal arrangement were followed,
the discussion of subordinate constructions would become highly fragmented.
Additionally, some minor subsections have been assigned to chapters on func-
tional grounds, such as (5.1.7.) on the impersonal use of the special verb root
jã- ‘to be’, although they are also mentioned in chapters where they belong
formally (in this case 7.6.2.).
    In the present work the subject of morpheme order has not been discussed
thoroughly. Its basic characteristics are dealt with briefly in (3.2.) as a separate
issue. Otherwise, it is only discussed in an ad hoc manner in those places where
it is of immediate importance for identification or proper understanding of a
specific morpheme, such as e.g. the negative morpheme -he- in (7.1.).
    With regard to the internal organisation of the subsections, I have striven to
discuss the most common constructions, and the examples which serve to il-
lustrate them, first, and the more exceptional ones towards the end of these
subsections.
28    1. Introduction    The examples are as much as possible in a phonemic spelling, but phonetic
variation is sometimes indicated. I found this necessary since not all questions
that concern the underlying phonological structures of Kwaza may have been
answered satisfactorily yet.34 Word boundary is symbolised by a space < > and
morpheme boundary by a hyphen <->, or, in the case of compounds (and
sometimes cliticisation), by the equation sign <=>. A dot <.> occurs between
multiple component elements of an English gloss corresponding to a single
morpheme in Kwaza. The presence of a glottal stop <?> is not indicated in
automatic positions, provided that these positions are preceded by a space, hy-
phen or equation sign (see the discussion concerning the glottal stop in 2.2.2.).
    The main stress of polysyllabic words is usually symbolised by an apostro-
phe <'> preceding the stressed syllable (see 2.8.).35 In chapter (2.) stress is only
indicated in the phonetic transcriptions, since it is not analysed as phonemic.
However, because the proposed rules of stress placement are sometimes not
consistent with stress placement in actual spontaneous data, main stress as ob-
served is always indicated in the rest of the work, even though the notation of
the glossed examples is largely phonemic. When a word contains two stress
markers it has not been possible to determine which one of them was main and
which one was secondary. Very long derived or compounded words may con-
tain several main stress positions. The precise determination of the rules with
regard to stress is a matter of future research.
    The free translations of the examples are based as directly as possible on the
Portuguese translations given of the Kwaza phrases by the consultants them-
selves. Because the notion “sentence” in Kwaza has not been thoroughly ex-
plored I have avoided the use of capitals and full stops in both the Kwaza mate-
rial and the free translations. The main exceptions to this concern proper names
and quoted utterances in the free translations.","[65, 66]"
"
1.9.   Structural characteristics of KwazaThe Kwaza vowel system comprises eight oral vowel phonemes and seven na-
sal vowel phonemes. The central close-mid vowel /y/ also occurs in semivowel
position. Nasality may spread to neighbouring vowels. There are 19 consonant
phonemes, among which implosive and apico-alveolar stops. Basic syllable
structure is Consonant-Vowel, and glides may occupy consonant position, ei-
ther together with other consonants or not. There is no phonemic tone, stress or
quantity. Main word stress tends to fall on the ultimate syllable of the stem. A
provisional analysis of the phonology of Kwaza was published by van der
Voort (1997a).
    The grammatical categories of Kwaza are verbs, nouns, adverbs, particles,
ideophones and auxiliary-like roots. There are no adjectives. Constituent order
in Kwaza is relatively free, although Subject-Verb-Object and Subject-Object-
Verb patterns prevail. Morphologically, Kwaza is a highly complex language
and most of the grammatical load is to be found on the verbs. There are over
300 derivational and inflexional suffixes and the distinction between these
categories is gradual rather than absolute. There are no complex morphopho-
nological processes. Reduplication and compounding occur frequently.
24    1. Introduction    Nominal morphology is fairly simple. Nouns, including pronouns, demon-
stratives and numerals, are not inflected for number or gender. Only a third
person possessor may be morphologically marked. Nouns may receive animate
object case marking or one of the oblique case markers: instrumental, locative,
beneficiary and comitative. Nouns can be zero-verbalised by attachment of per-
son and mood marking. Nouns can be modified by other nouns which are
placed in juxtaposition. Because complex verb forms can be nominalised and
function as nouns, nouns can of course be morphologically complex.
    Verbs are obligatorily marked for subject and mood, whereas overt pro-
nominal or lexical arguments are optional. Both the subject agreement system
and the personal pronoun system contain a distinction between first person in-
clusive and first person exclusive. Since the system explicitly indicates exclu-
sive agreement, by the form -xa-, the notions “singular” and “plural” are used
for convenience sake, even though the system is analysed as being based on
distinctions of “association”. Third person agreement is zero-marked. Indefinite
argument agreement has no lexical counterpart. Mood inflexion comprises de-
clarative, interrogative, the three persuasive moods imperative, exhortative and
volitive, which complement one another, and three prohibitive moods negative
imperative, negative exhortative and monitory. In the imperative and negative
imperative, second person “singular” subject agreement is zero-marked. Object
agreement of the verb is optional and can perhaps be regarded as derivational.
Negation, valency and valency change, and tense, modality and aspect are also
marked by a wide array of (probably derivational) verbal morphemes. Some
morphemes of modality are etymologically related to mood markers, such as
the causational morpheme -nƭ- and the exhortative mood marker -ni. Verbs can
be turned into nouns or adverbs by the highly multifunctional stem-final nomi-
nalising morphemes -hͿ and -nãi.
    Two quite prominent morphological categories in Kwaza are those of class
and directionality. Classifying morphemes have a very wide distribution and
may have nominalising and agreement properties. They can have a very general
meaning and refer to shape, substance and texture, but the majority are seman-
tically rather specific. In the present analysis, there are close to 150 classifiers.
Directional morphemes have a more limited distribution. They either occur on
verbs, where they indicate the direction in which an action or event takes place,
or they are used to form directional adverbs. There are nearly 45 directionals.
The distributions of classifiers and directionals overlap partially, and a small
number of these morphemes are ambiguous in this respect.
    The moods mentioned earlier are restricted to matrix clauses. In Kwaza sev-
eral different types of subordinate clauses may be formed. Subordinate clauses
usually precede matrix clauses. The predicates of subordinate clauses contain
the same subject agreement forms as mentioned earlier, but they have different
“mood” markers. Among the adverbial clauses there are two types of condi-
tional clauses, two basic types of concessive clauses, and additive, manner,
temporal and contemporative clauses, all marked by different predicate-final
morphemes. Among the nominal clauses there are attributive (relative) clauses
                                      1.9. Structural characteristics of Kwaza   25and complement clauses. These involve the same nominalisers as referred to
above. Kwaza does neither have infinitives nor conjunctional particles. How-
ever, long chains of medial clauses can be constructed through the cosubordi-
native “mood” marker. In these constructions a distinction is made between
same subject and different subject. The different subject marker is always
found on the subordinate clause, whereas it indicates that the subject of the next
clause is going to be different. When one of the different subjects is a non-third
person, a special switch reference mood marker is required.
    A special phenomenon in Kwaza, rare among the Amerindian languages, is
morphological ellipsis. Although verbs are canonically obligatorily marked for
person and mood, these inflexions can be omitted if the context permits. In-
versely, the inflexional complex of person and mood marking can occur freely
without a verb stem under similar circumstances. In both situations the hearer
can be expected to deduce from the context which verb stem or which inflex-
ions were intended by the speaker. On a more grammatical level, independently
occurring person and mood inflexions can also function as resumptive parti-
cles, and double layers of person and mood inflexion are instrumental in mor-
phologically complex constructions which have “complementising” functions
such as desiderative and quotation. A discussion of these phenomena from the
perspective of grammaticalisation was also the subject of a separate article (van
der Voort 2002a). Other unique grammatical phenomena in Kwaza concern
morphologically motivated reduplication of bound person markers to express
tense distinctions, and alternative morpheme orders to formally express the
distinction between canonical negation and negation of a presupposition.
    In the lexicon of Kwaza many items are encountered which show morpho-
logical structure. Often, formally similar roots without such morphological
complexity are semantically related, but not in an entirely productive way.
Therefore, such apparent morphological complexity is considered as lexicalised
and such roots are treated as monomorphemic. Nevertheless, there are certain
roots which are (semi-)lexicalised with morphemes that retain some productive
properties, such as those of the verb stem haka-(hͿ)- ‘to be old’. In the present
work I refer to these latter roots as bound or etymological roots.
    The following text excerpt is to illustrate some of the phenomena mentioned

7.7.8. Delay jale ‘wait!’The particle jale ‘wait (a little)!’ indicates that the speaker requires something
to be delayed or postponed for a short while. The particle may occur in isola-
tion:(3205)    ja'le
          wait
          ‘wait!, wait a little’In the following example, it is part of a quotative construction:(3206)    ja'le-da-ki
          wait-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m saying ‘wait a little!’’It occurs often in a negative imperative combination with the verb root ihƭ- ‘on
the contrary’, which was discussed in (5.2.7.) and (7.1.2.):(3207)    ja'le=ihƭ-ky
          wait=contrary-NEI
          ‘wait, let!’, ‘wait a bit still’(3208)    ja'le=ihƭ-ky         kurakura-to'hoi txi'te-ta-da-mͿ

          ‘wait, we’re going to drink!’
7.7.9. Exhortation hӻdİ ‘let's go!’The exhortative particle hͿdİ was also presented in (5.2.4.3.). The stress on the
last syllable is sometimes so heavy, that the first syllable becomes reduced to
nothing: [Èe]. This was the case in the following example (although it is written
in its full form here):(3211)    hͿ'dİ      jã-Ϳ-'rjͿ            kari'cwa-na    'İ-a-ta
          go!        DIST-this-CD:area field-LOC         go-1P-CSO
          ‘let’s go there to the old field!’ (t)In the next example it is embedded in a quotative construction:(3212)    hͿ'dİ-xa-tsy-tse   dy='bwa-a-hͿ
          go!-2-POT-DEC      cut=end-1P-NOM
          ‘when you say “let’s go!” we’ll finish to cut all (the rice)’
7.7.10.   Minimal expressions and responsesa ‘ouch!’. The element a is used to express ‘ouch!’.hã ‘hey!’. The element hã, with a voiceless /h/, is used to call the attention of
wife or husband. An identical particle is used in Aikanã.ӻ ‘uhh’. The element Ϳ can also be used in the hesitation sense of ‘uhh’.hӻ ‘uhh’. The element hͿ is sometimes uttered as a minimal response when one
has not understood the previous speaker:(3213)    Q:    xyi ece-nͿ-ku'ty-xa-hͿ-re                          A:      hͿ
                you lubricate-REF-CL:head-2-NOM-INT                        uhh
                ‘do you put oil in your hair?’                             ‘uhh?’hãhã ‘it is’. The element hãhã ‘it is’ is used as a minimal response by the hear-
ers when someone tells a story. It is not felicitous to use hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes’ in this way.
604   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresha?ã ‘here!’. The element ha?ã is used when one presents something to some-
one:(3214)    ha'?ã     u'ru
          here!     patua
          ‘look, here are patua seeds!’hӻ?ӻ ‘yes, O.K.’. As a positive minimal response, hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes, O.K.’ is used.
The second syllable bears the accent. It can also be pronounced as hã'?ã, hã'hã,
hy'?Ϳ, “hmhm” or Ϳ'hͿ. It is also a positive minimal response to commands.
Roquette-Pinto (1950:152) attributes the wide diffusion of “Hum! Hum!” in
this function among Brazilians, esp. in Mato-Grosso and Rondônia, to Indian
influence.tse ‘yes’. Another positive minimal response is tse ‘yes’, sometimes pro-
nounced as [se]. It is used much in family II. It is not to be confused with the
interjection tsİh ‘why!’ or the declarative morpheme -tse.","[640, 641, 642]"

ble has a higher pitch than the second one and it also bears the accent. The
vowel of the second syllable is often long.hӻhӻ ‘I don’t know’. As a minimal negative answer to a question hͿ'hͿ ‘I don’t

             ‘where is the pan?’                     ‘I don’t know’ƭnƭ ‘O.K.’. The element ƭnƭ ‘O.K., yes it is, let him!’, also pronounced as [ƭ'ni],
is a reassuring reply to comment or a warning about someone else:(3217)    R: ja-e-da'mͿ-tse                       A: ƭ'nƭ
             eat-again-want-DEC                      O.K.
             ‘he (said he) is going to eat again’    ‘let him!’, ‘it’s O.K.!’It seems possible that the part -nƭ of ƭnƭ is etymologically related to the exhor-
tative morpheme -ni and the part ƭ- to the pronoun ƭ ‘he’.

The preceding chapters concerned the basic parts of speech and their morphol-
ogy. The present chapter deals with complex constructions, or, to be more pre-
cise, the morphology of verbs in complex clause constructions. In Kwaza there
are three types of clauses: matrix clauses, subordinate clauses and medial
clauses. A full sentence always consists of a matrix clause. The morphological
properties of the constituents of single matrix clauses, such as case marking,
person and mood marking and derivational extension, were discussed in the
previous sections. A full sentence may also consist of a complex matrix clause
that contains other, non-matrix clauses such as adverbial clauses. The verb that
bears matrix clause morphology is usually sentence-final. The (co-) subordi-
nated clauses normally precede the matrix verb. The difference between all
these types of clauses is signalled by verbal morphology, especially by inflex-
ional endings.
    Subordinate clauses are discussed in section (8.2.) on adverbial clauses and
section (8.4.) on nominal clauses. Apart from subordinate clauses, Kwaza also
has clauses which are semantically coordinated with the matrix clause, but
which are morphosyntactically subordinated to the matrix clause, and which
may form multiple clause chains. These clauses are discussed in (8.3.), and I
have called them “cosubordinated” or “medial” clauses. In spite of the fact that
Kwaza has no conjunctional element which means ‘and’, functional coordina-
tion of noun phrases is nonetheless possible. This is discussed in (8.5.). Finally,
there are some specific syntactic constructions the grammatical structure of
which is interpreted in more or less ideosyncratic ways. Such special construc-
tions form a sort of templates which convey notions such as habituality. This is
dealt with in (8.6.). The first subsection of this chapter, (8.1.), is an exposition
on the bound morpheme -tsy-, which has several different functions, and which
is treated here because of its importance in complex clause constructions.","[642, 643]"

moods (see 5.2.10.). In the negative imperative the negative element -he- is
readily recognisable. The mood marker, however, is not -ra, but -ky:(1480)     (ay-'hͿ) kui-'he-ky                 (*kui-'he-ra)
           that-NOM drink-NEG-NEI
           ‘don’t drink that!’In all other respects the negative imperative is the negative equivalent of the
imperative. The next examples demonstrate that a plural subject is cross-
referred to by the associated person marker -xa- only, instead of -xa-xa-, and
that the second person subject is zero-marked while in cosubordinate sentences
it remains marked by the second person marker -xa-.188
188.This issue has been discussed exhaustively in (5.2.3.).

          ‘don’t be afraid of it, it (e.g. spider) does not bite anyone’Example (1482) also indicates that the negative imperative is a discontinous
morpheme. The negation marker is separated both by subject and object cross-
reference from the mood marker.
    There is another negative imperative with a less immediate future reading. It
involves -ky in a compound combination with the verbal root ihƭ- ‘on the con-
trary’, ‘it isn’t like that’, ‘wait!’. This verbal root may contain or be related to
the adverbial negative element ƭ (see 7.1.2.). The effect of this construction re-
minds of the ones with procrastinative -tara- ‘later’ (see 5.5.19.).(1486)    tjari-'nã=ƭhƭ-'ky
          shoot-FUT=contrary-NEI
          ‘you should not want to kill him!’ (t)(1487)    awre-'ja-damͿ=ihƭ-ky             'İ-da-kywy
          marry-IO-want=contrary-NEI go-1S-COND
          ‘don’t think of getting married to someone while I’m gone!’The presence of future -nã- and -damͿ in most of these examples seems to ex-
press ‘want’ rather than ‘future’. In combination with the interjection particle
ja'le ‘wait a little!’, ihƭky can do without a future morpheme:(1488)    ja'le=ihƭ-ky             (1489)   ja'le=ihƭ-ky            'kui-da-mͿ

          ‘wait a little bit more!’         ‘hold it!, I’m going to drink!’

                                                                    5.2. Mood   321In some of the previous examples the element -ky- occurred as part of the Con-
ditional marker -kywy. It has no negative or imperative value there, but it may
be related to the negative imperative -ky. It will be discussed in (8.2.1.).
    A possible third type of negative imperative is found in the particle-like ex-
pression nãi?ini ‘don’t do (it)!’, ‘stop!’. As it employs the exhortative mood
marker -ni, it will be treated below in (5.2.8.).
    Another different negative imperative is probably a fixed expression. Only
one example was attested:(1490)    nãi-'ky-xa-ta'nãi-nãi       'e-xa-re
          like-IMP-2-CSO like-NOM have-2-INT
          ‘why on earth are you doing that?’ (stop it!) (t)Example (1490) seems to represent neither an elliptic construction, nor an in-
stance of rapid speech where the element -he- was deleted, because in a subse-
quent discussion with the consultant it was repeated in exactly the same way.
   A final type of negative imperative was discussed in (5.2.3.). This is an em-
phatic negative imperative construction illustrated by the examples (1371) and
(1372). The following examples illustrate the contrast between this negated
emphatic imperative construction and the canonical prohibitive negative im-
perative:(1491)    ja-'he-ca-ra                         (1492)      'ja-he-ky
          eat-NEG-EMP-IMP                                  eat-NEG-NEI
          ‘you are nót going to eat!                       ‘don’t eat!’
          (since you didn’t work)’These examples suggest that the presence of emphatic -ca- (see 5.2.3.3.) re-
quires -ra instead of -ky.","[357, 358, 359]"
"
5.5.14.3. Appellative -herejã-In a compound structure with the verb root jã- ‘to be’ (see 7.2.11.), and without
a “conjectural” subject, -here- has an appellative and possibly even expletive
function. In the present work I treat -herejã- as one morpheme:(2156)     di'lİ di'lİ mãrİ̘ri'tsa 'bu=Ǌ-rjͿ-herejã-ki
           who who person             put=be-CD:area-APPL-DEC
           ‘who (the hell) is that person sitting there?’ (t)The morpheme can be followed by an interrogative mood marker with the same
emphatic effect (see also 5.2.2.1.):(2157)     'mã-herejã-re
           mother-APPL-INT
           ‘it is mother, didn’t you notice (you fool)!’   Nasalisation does not spread in -herejã-. Even though the Western ear easily
hears [he'4ӁjѸã], such a pronunciation is immediately rejected. Only if one
makes the effort to say [he'rejã] is it accepted by the speakers of Kwaza.
   In procedural texts, such as about how to make chicha, -herejã- occurs fre-
quently and functions as an evidential tag question with the meaning ‘isn’t it?’:(2158)     kayte='te-a-hͿ-herejã-re
           scrape=RED-1P-NOM-APPL-INT
           ‘we clean it (the mortar) on the inside, don’t we’ (t)It may be followed by an explicit tag question:(2159)     nͿ-nãi-'he-tsy-hͿ-herejã-re            awͿi-'he-xa-re
           big-NOM-NEG-GER-NOM-APPL-INT           see-NEG-2-INT
           ‘this is not much (money), now is it?’253.Note that the function of -dy- and -ta- in this example is not well understood.
426   5. The verb phraseThe appellative may have an edifying tone. The ostensibly counterintuitive re-
sult is that a very affirmative statement is phrased as a question:(2160)   cu'ku-herejã-re
         tongue-APPL-INT
         ‘(it is called the) tongue’The appellative -herejã- can be used to express irritation or indignation at
someone “who should know”:(2161)   a=a'nǊ-herejã-re        ('rai?ͿhͿ)
         RED=plant-APPL-INT thing
         ‘he is planting (things), don’t you see?’(2162)   Q: ti-'rjͿ-re          koreja'ro        A: 'jã-Ϳ-hͿ-herejã-re
            what-CD:area-INT pan                    DIST-this-NOM-APPL-INT
            ‘where is the pan?’                     ‘it is there, don’t you see?’(2163)   wady-nƭ'nã-da-hͿ-herejã-re
         give-2O-1S-NOM-APPL-INT
         ‘I’ve already given it to you!’Note about the following example, which concerns an order which has not been
obeyed, that the order itself is embedded as a quoted utterance on a deeper
level:(2164)   tsoroi=oja-'ra-da-hͿ-herejã-re
         run=go-IMP-1S-NOM-APPL-INT
         ‘I asked you to run from there!’ (t)The appellative may furthermore express a complaint, such as about someone’s
drinking:(2165)   'kui-herejã-hͿ
         drink-APPL-NOM
         ‘I think he was drinking, wasn’t he?’Or it is used to express irritation at someone who is nagging. The following ex-
ample was given in a context where the hearer has tried to tease the speaker
about (the latter) not drinking enough chicha:(2166)   'kui-da-herejã-re
         drink-1S-APPL-INT
         ‘am I drinking, or what!’
                                                5.5. Tense, modality and aspect   427However, irritation is often faked:(2167)    Q: wãnͿ'dy 'a-xa-re                   A: a-he'rejã-ki
             food        exist-2-INT               exist-APPL-DEC
             ‘do you have food?’                   ‘of course there is!
             (lit. ‘is there food with you?’)      (otherwise I wouldn’t offer)’(2168)    'kui-xa-hͿ-herejã-re
          drink-2-NOM-APPL-INT
          ‘of course you may drink!’The appellative is also used in contexts where one tries to fool someone. The
next example was given in a context where the speaker tried to make the hearer
believe that he was drinking, whereas in reality the drink was thrown away:(2169)    'kui-da-hͿ-herejã-re
          drink-1S-NOM-APPL-INT
          ‘don’t you see that I’m drinking?’
5.5.15.   Degrammaticalisation of mood inflexion to modal derivationIt seems that the gerundial -tsy-, volitional -damͿ- and causational -nƭ- mor-
phemes are the result of one and the same process. Because of the descriptive
aims of the present work, I have tried to avoid the more theoretical subject of
distinction between inflexional and derivational morphology. At this point,
however, the distinction may be useful in trying to describe the nature of cer-
tain parallel and interrelated characteristics of Kwaza morphology.
    The morphological complex of bound person and mood marking sometimes
occurs as a clitic morpheme or even as a free morpheme. In section (5.5.11.) it
is shown that cliticisation of person and mood marking to predicates which are
already inflected for person and mood is a productive means to quote speech. It
seems on a more diachronic level that, as a result of this same phenomenon of
post-cliticisation of further person and mood suffixes, the volitive (-mͿ), ex-
hortative (-ni), monitory (-tsi) and declarative (-tse) mood morphemes have de-
veloped into modal volitional (-damͿ-), causational (-nƭ-), preventive (-tsi-) and
gerundial (-tsy-) morphemes, respectively. The causational and gerundial do
not contain person cross-reference. In the case of the volitional, however, the
element -da- is still recognisable as the first person singular cross-reference
morpheme, be it not any longer productive.
    Kwaza person and mood suffixes are obligatory and they probably have to
be considered as inflexions, whereas the temporal, modal and aspectual suf-
fixes discussed in the present section represent optional categories and are thus
derivational. In a way then, in Kwaza, certain elements of inflexional morphol-
ogy develop into derivational morphology. To a certain extent, this coincides
428   5. The verb phrasewith Bybee’s (1985:165-189) observations about the development of modality.
However, the fact that the volitive mood develops even further, into a lexical
verbal root, is in contradiction with Bybee.
    In contrast to the three modality morphemes discussed here, the Kwaza pur-
posive -te-, desiderative -heta- and the conjectural element -here- have not, as
far as could be ascertained, developed out of identifiable mood markers. How-
ever, as demonstrated in the relevant subsections, it does occur with obligatory
productive person cross-reference marking, and the structure of the derived and
inflected verb strongly resembles the quotation construction.
    Probably, the development of certain modality morphemes in Kwaza can be
regarded as a result of degrammaticalisation, a process which has been dis-
cussed by Norde (1997, 2001) in her case study about the Swedish genitive.
The inflexionability of certain modality morphemes, such as purposive -te-,
seems to underscore the gradualness of this process. However, this is not
proven since these morphemes are etymologically unanalysable.254
    In van der Voort (2002a) I discuss the possibility that the present analysis of
these phenomena depends on the overall analysis of Kwaza as a morphologi-
cally complex language, and I show, for example, that similar phenomena can
be attested in the highly polysynthetic Eskimo languages.255
5.5.16.   Irrealis -rydy-Because of its main function in conditional adverbial clause constructions, the
irrealis condition morpheme -rydy- is discussed in section (8.2.1.2.) of the
chapter on complex constructions. The following examples show that it can
also be used in a simple matrix clause:(2170)    'ti-nãi      etay-tja'te-rydy-re
          what-NOM woman-3.POS-IRR-INT
          ‘would it be that she was his wife?’(2171)    alexunwͿ-rydy-'hͿ-he-ki
          tree-IRR-NOM-NEG-DEC
          ‘they said it is axe-handle wood but it isn’t’
254.Note that other etymologically unanalysable modality morphemes, such as irrealis
    -rydy-, are not even inflexionable for person at all.
255.The origin of Kwaza modality morphemes resembles the development of local case
    markers of Greenlandic into derivational morphemes, which are placed deeper inside
    the word, and other processes attested in Eskimo (e.g. Fortescue 1984:78;227;321-
    322, De Reuse 1994:170-230, Sadock 1991:174-175). Something similar was docu-
    mented for Ecuadorian Quechua in Muysken (1977:105-107).

general lack of involvement by the speaker. It may have a past connotation. It
is usually attached to nominalised verbs. It is often used in answers to ques-
tions.","[463, 464, 465, 466, 467]"
"
7.2.10.   Exclamative -tadyThe exclamative morpheme -tady can be translated as ‘blast!, yes!, that’s it!,
isn’t it?, aha!’. It is always immediately preceded by a noun or a nominalised
verb. It usually receives main stress. It expresses indignation, surprise or satis-
faction with the discovery of the identity of the referent of the noun, or with the
explanatory quality of the event denoted by the verb.(2960)    cay-ta'dy            (2961)   Ǌce'nãi-a-ta    'a-a-he-hͿ-ta'dy
          papaya-EXCL                   know-1P-CSO exist-1P-NEG-NOM-EXCL
          ‘ah, it is a wild papaya!’    ‘ah!, and us knowing nothing!’(2962)    de'da      nãi-da-hͿ-ta'dy      / de'da      kore'we-da-hͿ-ta'dy

          ‘it was a snake with which I was pregnant!’ (t)On only one occasion -tady occurred in the place of a mood marker. Compare
the following examples:(2963)    ba-ja'hͿ-wa-ki            (2964)    ba-ja'hͿ-wa-ta'dy
          cut-CL:path-IS-DEC                  cut-CL:path-IS-EXCL
          ‘they cleared the road(side)’       ‘ah! they cleared the road(side)’
                                      7.2. Morphemes not limited to word class   555The main reason to consider -tady as a bound morpheme, and not as a particle,
is that it always occurs in a fixed position after the noun. It is not attached to
fully inflected verbs, and it does not move around the sentence freely.
    In elliptic constructions (see 7.5.), however, -tady may behave as a root
element and bear person and mood markers. Note the reported speech con-
struction in the following example:(2965)    di'lİ 'mã-hata-kywy       ta'dy-xa-lİ     tso'roi=onİ-he-ky
          who call-3S.2O-COND EXCL-2-PREC run=come-NEG-NEI
          ‘if anyone calls you, don’t say “O.K.!” and come running, no!’ (t)    The element -tady is optionally followed by the verb root jã- ‘to be’, which
is compounded with it, or cliticised to it (see 7.2.11.). The extension with jã-
seems to give extra emphasis: -tady=jã-ki ‘now we know!, thát’s it!’322.(2966)    'mİ̘-hata-hͿ-ta'dy=jã-ki

          ‘(I’m disappointed that) they don’t know how to play football!’    Also -tady=jã-ki does not build an independent phrase by itself, except in
elliptic constructions, in the proper context, e.g. when someone tells has in-
formed the speaker of something which he already knows:

7.2.11.   The verb root jã- ‘to be’The verb root jã- ‘to be’ has many uses, and they were discussed in several
places throughout the present work. Because of its manifold functions and its
diverging distribution, I have briefly summarised all its uses here.
   As the root of an independent predicate, jã- ‘to be’ is used as an affirmative
expression:(2973)    jã-'ki
          be-DEC
          ‘that’s it!’, ‘that’s correct’, ‘that’s how it’s done!’Example (2973) is used, for instance, in a teaching situation. The next example
represents an utterance by which the speaker solicits confirmation:(2974)    jã-'re

          ‘how is it you do it?’, ‘how is it you said?’These expressions are all quite dependent on the pragmatic context.
  In a number of instances, jã- ‘to be’ was used in the sense of ‘to say’:(2977)    jere'xwa 'jã-hͿ=wara             (2978)     jere'xwa jã-'nãi jã'si

          ‘(I’m) telling you bring here the pan!’ (ordering again)In the above examples, jã- nevertheless continues to be literally interpretable as
‘to be’.
    The verb root jã- ‘to be’ is used mostly in various types of fixed compound
expressions. In (5.5.14.3.) it was discussed in combination with the appellative
conjectural morpheme -here. As demonstrated in (7.2.10.), it has an emphatic
effect in combination with exclamative -tady. Finally, in (8.6.3.) it is dealt with
as part of a special construction with an indignant function. In some of these
constructions, it is difficult to establish whether the element jã- is truly a cliti-
cised verb root. Sometimes, namely, it resembles a cross-reference morpheme.
Compare the following examples:(2982)    areta-'he-damͿ-tsy-hͿ-ta'dͿ=jã-ki
          know-NEG-want-GER-NOM-EXCL=be-DEC
          ‘ah, he is not going to learn (to speak Kwaza), no way!’(2983)    areta-'he-damͿ-tsy-hͿ-ta'dy-da-ki
          know-NEG-want-GER-NOM-EXCL-1S-DEC
          ‘ah, he is not going to learn (to speak Kwaza), no way!’These examples were said by the consultant to be identical in meaning. It is
interesting to note that the element =jã- ‘to be’ is in the same position as
cross-reference marker -da-. However, one may presume that the grammatical
structure of the examples is different, and that jã- represents a sort of dummy
verb, which is compounded with the preceding utterance, whereas the first per-
son marker -da- is applied after zero-verbalisation. In both examples, that
which follows -tady has an emphatic function. In the following examples, the
same contrast can be observed twice:(2984)    e'nãi-tja-eteja-'tsi=jã-'ta          areta-'nã=jã-ki
          quarrel-TRA-1PO-MON=be-CSO           know-FUT=be-DEC
          ‘for him not to quarrel with us, therefore we’re going to learn’(2985)    e'nãi-tja-eteja-'tsi-xa-xa-'ta       areta-'nã-xa-xa-ki
          quarrel-TRA-1PO-MON-2-AS-CSO know-FUT-2-AS-DEC
          ‘for him not to quarrel with us, therefore you’re going to learn’
558    7. Other morphosyntactic structuresAgain, jã- occurs in (2984) in the same position as the person marker in (2985).
However, here there is a semantic difference. When one compares the transla-
tions, the element jã- seems to indicate a first person plural. Note from the
comparison of the following examples how jã- appears to agree only with a
first person plural inclusive cross-reference marker in the matrix clause:(2986)    tsǊhǊ-'du=jã-lİ       'nãi-a-tsy-re (*nãi-da-tsy-re)
          what-BER=be-PREC like-1P-POT-INT
          ‘what are we going to do that for?’ (t)(2987)    tsǊhǊ-'du-da-lİ       'nãi-da-tsy-re
          what-BER-1S-PREC      like-1S-POT-INT
          ‘what am I going to do that for?’(2988)    tsǊhǊ-'du-xa-lİ       'nãi-xa-tsy-re
          what-BER-2-PREC       like-2-POT-INT
          ‘what are you going to do that for?’Note also about (2986) that the inclusive morpheme -a- cannot be replaced by
another cross-reference morpheme. The same kind of “agreement” differences
were encountered in the contrast between the examples (2080) and (2081) in
(5.5.12.). In many examples in section (5.5.12.) which involve the element jã-
in a position where one would expect a cross-reference morpheme, the transla-
tions suggest that the subject is impersonal323. Compare the following exam-
ples, and note their approximate literal translations:(2989)    ti-nãi-da-'te-xa-ta            'e-xa-re
          what-NOM-1S-PURP-2-CSO have-2-INT

                 (lit. ‘it is for us to (say) “we show it to people”‘)
323.In most Portuguese translations the subject was expressed as a gente, literally ‘the
    people’, but which is an impersonal way to talk about the first person plural ‘one,
    people (including me)’.
                                                              7.3. Reduplication   559(2991)    ti-nãi=jã-'te=jã-ta              erewe-'tay-a-re

          ‘why does one write/paint the mortar?’ (t)
          (lit. ‘do we paint the mortar because one (says) “why does one?”?’)In some contexts, the occurrence of jã- as the only root of an independent
predicate was even translated with an impersonal sense:(2992)    jã-hͿ-'tsy
          be-NOM-RES
          ‘one already did that one’The following example contains both the sense ‘to be’ and, as fixed part of the
appellative morpheme -herejã-, the impersonal use of jã-:(2993)    ('nãi)=jã-'hͿ-here.jã-re
          like=be-NOM-APPL.be-INT
          ‘it’s like this that one does it’, ‘you have to do it like this’So, it appears that the verb root jã- ‘to be’ may somehow agree with first per-
son plural (inclusive) cross-reference, and that it is sometimes translated as an
inclusive impersonal ‘one’. On some rare occasions, jã- was even directly
translated by consultants as ‘we’. Nevertheless, I consider jã- as a verb root
meaning ‘to be’, which has an impersonal sense in some applications (see also
5.1.7.).","[592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597]"

7.1.2. The emphatic negative element -ƭ-In certain constructions an element ƭ occurs with a negative connotation. When
it is a particle, it represents the adverb ƭ ‘idly’ and is homophonous with the
third person pronoun ƭ ‘he’. In the following example, it cannot be a pronoun:(2838)    ƭ     kui-tsy-nãi-'le-xa-ki
          idly drink-GER-NOM-only-2-DEC
          ‘oh, you just keep on drinking, doing nothing!’   In certain expressions, the element -ƭ- also occurs inside the word as a sort
of emphatic and sometimes relatively expletive negative morpheme. In one of
310.Notice how the negative morpheme in this one example retained its stress, even
    though it is immediately adjacent to -ki.
311.The use of the instrumental case marking of ‘sugar’ here may be due to influence of
    Portuguese in which the preposition com ‘with’ both has comitative, instrumental
    and other functions.
                                                             7.1. Negation   535these expressions it precedes a monitory mood marker in a focal way of
speaking. Compare the following:(2839)   ti-nãi-'tse=xa-ta         wãrͅ-dy-'ta-xa-re
         what-NOM-DEC=2-CSO enemy-CAU-TRA-2-INT
         ‘why is it you are angry with him?’(2840)   ti-'nãi-ƭ-'tsi          wãrͅ-dy-'ta-xa-re
         what-NOM-NEG-MON enemy-CAU-TRA-2-INT
         ‘why the hell is it you are angry with him?’(2841)   oja'nͿ=oja'nͿ-xa-ta    'a-xa-hͿ-tsy    ti-'nãi-ƭ-tsi

         arrive-NEG-2-INT
         ‘you always came, why don’t you come any more?’In the above examples, the element -tsi does not seem to have a monitory or
preventive function. However in the following elliptic form it does have a
monitory connotation:(2842)   ƭ-'tsi-da-ta
         NEG-MON-1S-CSO
         ‘therefore I didn’t want to’This phrase can be uttered as a reaction when someone did something against
the advice of the speaker, and made a mess of it. Probably, it represents a quo-
tative construction. In fact, the combination ƭ-tsi- could alternatively be re-
garded as a verb root with the sense of ‘to warn’:(2843)   ja      ƭ-'tsi-da-ta   ja      u'te-da-le-hͿ
         already NEG-MON-1S-CSO already notify-1S-FRUST-NOM         jãsi-'he-cwa-ta      nãi-wa-nãi-'ko   i-i'si-wa-ki
         hear-NEG-IS-CSO like-IS-NOM-INS RED-die-IS-DEC
         ‘I already warned them and told them so clearly, however, because
         they didn’t listen they all died’ (t)Maybe ƭtsi has become a separate particle in this position, meaning ‘in vain’,
‘wrong(ful)ly’, ‘just like that’ or ‘without reason’. Under that analysis, e.g.
(2840) should be read as ‘why are you angry with him just like that?’ and ex-
ample (2841) as ‘why do you stay away for no reason?’.
   One type of construction, which was rarely encountered, was not well un-
derstood. The only attested examples are the following:
536    7. Other morphosyntactic structures(2844)    oja-'ra-ƭsi o'ja-da-hͿ-ki            (2845)     'nãi-ƭsi 'nãi-da-hͿ-ki
          go-IMP-??? go-1S-NOM-DEC                        like-??? like-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘he ordered to go, so I went’                   ‘he said thus and so I did’The first clause in example (2844) reminds of a subordinate clause which con-
stitutes a quotative construction involving -si as a switch reference marker. The
first clause in example (2845) looks like an ordinary subordinated verb. How-
ever, the element -ƭ- is strange. It does not seem to be a negative marker, and it
is probably neither a morphophonological variant nor a mistake for the attribu-
tive morpheme -Ϳ-. It is also very unlikely that -ƭ- represents the third person
pronoun, since pronouns never occur in that position. If one were to accept that
explanation, one could take the argument also a step further and claim that -si-
represents the first person pronoun, which is just as unlikely. Another, more
likely explanation is that -si is another pronunciation of the monitory marker
-tsi. In section (2.14.) phoneme fluctuation between /s/ and /ts/ was attested.
This is confirmed by an alternative pronunciation of the first word of (2840) as
ti'nãi?ƭ'si ‘why? (would you do that, don’t)’. If this is also the case in (2844)
and (2845), they could be interpreted respectively as ‘he just ordered (me) to go
so I went’ and ‘just because he (said) it, I did it’. Example (2816) and the fol-
lowing should probably be interpreted in a similar manner:(2846)    mangka-dy'nͿ nǊ'ty       ja-da-'he-tsy-tse      kukui'hͿ-nã-ƭ-tsi
          mango-COMIT honey eat-1S-NEG-POT-DEC ill-FUT-NEG-MON
          ‘I’m not going to eat mango with honey, or else I’ll (just) get ill’   The following idiomatic type of construction is a kind of clefted negative
reason clause:(2847)    kui-da-'ki=tsy-ƭ-lİ            oja'nͿ-re
          drink-1S-DEC=POT-NEG-PREC arrive-INT
          ‘why have they come, for they don’t drink?’312(2848)    tsǊhǊ-'nã-tja tsasi-'re      wara'ñͿ-da-ki=tsy-ƭ-lİ          nãi-'re
          what-FUT-CSO follow-INT work-1S-DEC=POT-NEG-PREC like-INT
          ‘what is he coming after us for?, no way he is thinking of working, so
          what does he want?’ (t)The preconditional morpheme -lİ seems to be part of this fixed expression.
    The element -ƭ- may also explain part of an alternative negative exhortative
mood form -ini, which occurs in a limited set of expressions. This is dealt with
in (5.2.8.).","[572, 573, 574]"
"
7.1.1.6. Negative -he- in compoundsIn compounds, the negative morpheme is encountered in various positions. It
may follow the second member and have scope over both:(2817)    areta=mã-'he-da-ki
          know=call-NEG-1S-DEC
          ‘I don’t know how to call it’(2818)    tsãrã=txu'hǊi-nahere       Ǌcenãi=pİ̘rİ̘jã-hͿ-he-'ki

          speak anything (of the Kanoê language)!’ (t)(2819)    tͅi'tja-da-ta  ja=bwa-'he-da-ki
          alone-1S-CSO eat=finish-NEG-1S-DEC
          ‘being on my own, I can’t eat it all’The negative morpheme may also be inserted between the first and the second
member and have scope over only the first:(2820)    txa'rwa tsje-'he=bwa-ki
          first    grab-NEG=finish-DEC
          ‘(the hawk) does not grab (chickens) any more’Literally this example means ‘(the hawk) ended up by not grabbing (chick-
ens)’.307 When negative morphemes are on both members of a compound, they
only have scope over the immediately preceding root, and the result is coordi-
nation:
307.The combination -he=bwa- is a fixed way to express ‘not any more’: dehemǊ'te kui-
    he'bwadaki ‘I don’t drink spirits anymore’.
532    7. Other morphosyntactic structures(2821)     ja-'he=kui-'he-tse
           eat-NEG=drink-NEG-DEC
           ‘he didn’t eat and didn’t drink’
7.1.1.7. Miscellaneous constructions involving -he-There is a relation between interrogative lexemes and negation. Kwaza has
neither an indefinite pronoun nor a negative pronoun. In combination with ver-
bal negation the interrogative pronoun fulfils the functions of indefinite nega-
tive pronoun. Note the following construction:(2822)     di'lİ onİ-'he-tse
           who arrive-NEG-DEC
           ‘no-one came’There are also less transparent uses of the negative in combination with inter-
rogative roots. The following example represents a fixed way to express a de-
cided or indignant refusal:(2823)     tsuhǊ-'du-da-lİ        pİ̘rİ̘jã-'tja-da-he-tsy-tse
           what-BER-1S-PREC       speak-TRA-1S-NEG-POT-DEC
           ‘why should I talk to him?, I won’t!’308The next example expresses great doubt or even despair:(2824)     ti-'nãi-da-he-tsy-tse
           what-NOM-1S-NEG-POT-DEC
           ‘what am I going to do now?’ (t)It was not attested whether this latter example really represents a specific fixed
way to express doubt, but the combination of negation and an interrogative root
does suggest that this is the case.
    In combination with a verb marked negative the adverb da'nͿ ‘still’ should
be interpreted as ‘not yet’, ‘before’:(2825)     da'nͿ     İ-'he-nã-da-ki
           still     go-NEG-FUT-1S-DEC
           ‘I’m not going away yet’(2826)     da'nͿ     awe-'he-tsy-wy

           I friend still     eat-NEG-1S-time-but go-DEC
           ‘(my) friend went away before I had eaten’   The concept of “neither” can be expressed by a coordinating construction:(2829)     pãu e-'he           hã    e-'he-da-ki
           bread have-NEG water have-NEG-1S-DEC
           ‘I have neither bread nor water’(2830)     txa'rwa hajediko're   ka'wİ              kui-'he

           tea drink-NEG-ATT-DR:matutinal-1S-DEC
           ‘this morning I drank neither tea nor coffee’309Apparently, the repetitive morpheme -e- ‘too’ (see 4.4.6.) or ‘again’ (see
5.5.31.) can also be interpreted as ‘neither’ when it occurs on an argument of a
negative verb. Compare the following examples with one another:(2831)     ͿhͿ'ko awe-'he-tsy-hͿ=wara            Bahozo-'na       a'we-ki
           here       rain-NEG-GER-NOM=but Barroso-LOC rain-DEC
           ‘here it is not raining, but in Barroso it is raining’(2832)     ͿhͿ'ko awe-'he-tja          ay-rjͿ-'e            awe-'he-tse

           ‘here it is not raining and in (Barroso) it is not raining either’Note that when this morpheme (or its allomorph) is applied to the negative verb
itself, its meaning is predictable:(2833)     kui-'he-je?e-nã-da-ki
           drink-NEG-again-FUT-1S-DEC
           ‘I’m not going to drink more/again’    The contrast between the following examples shows that negation cannot be
attached to either constituent of the habitual complement construction:
309.This is the only attested example in which attributive -Ϳ- is preceded by -he-.

always involves the countersuppositional morpheme order.","[569, 570, 571, 572]"
"
7.1.1.2. The counter of presupposition by -heIn the countersupposition construction, the negative morpheme is found in a
different position, after person inflexion. Furthermore, the negator does not
tend to attract stress (whereas the mood marker sometimes does). Compare the
following examples and notice the difference in meaning:(2771)    kawİ       kui-'he-da-ki
          coffee drink-NEG-1S-DEC
          ‘I did not drink coffee (yet)’(2772)    kawİ      'kui-da-he-ki
          coffee drink-1S-NEG-DEC
          ‘I’m not drinking coffee (but something else)’294Apparently, the order in which the negative precedes the person marker indi-
cates negation of the action expressed by the verb root. The reverse order, per-
son-negative, seems to indicate negation of the object of the verb. A somewhat
similar difference may be observed between the following examples:(2773)    awͿi-'he-(c)wa-ki     (2774)        a'wͿi-wa-he-ki
          see-NEG-IS-DEC                      see-IS-NEG-DEC
          ‘he did not see’,                   ‘they did not look’,
          ‘they are not watching now’         ‘he didn’t (go there to) have a look’The following example shows how satellites marked by oblique case are con-
trasted in the countersupposition construction:(2775)    kuja'ba-na       oja-da-'he,     vilena-ko-'le
          Cuiabá-LOC       leave-IS-NEG Vilhena-INS-only
          ‘I didn’t go to Cuiabá, only to Vilhena’Note that this example, which is from family II, is elliptic since the mood
marker is absent, and it forms an exception to the statement that the negative
does not attract stress in the countersupposition construction.",[560]

                                                                      7.1. Negation   537    Finally, there is a verb root i'hƭ- ‘contrary’ of which the first syllable resem-
bles the negative element. It has a somewhat contrastive connotation which will
last into the near future:(2849)    i'hƭ-ki
          contrary-DEC
          ‘on the contrary’, ‘wait!’, ‘no!’, ‘it is not like that!’This root also combines with the negative imperative element -ky in an alterna-
tive negative exhortative expression which pertains to a somewhat remote fu-
ture. This was discussed in (5.2.7.). Furthermore, ihƭ- was encountered (as
[ƭhƭ]) in the following construction with the sense of ‘continue’, ‘for the com-
ing time’:(2850)    cwa-ra'ti=ihƭ-rai-re
          IS-FOC=contrary-damn-INT
          ‘it is like that they continue hereafter’It can even be combined with the negative morpheme -he-:(2851)    a-'he=ihƭ-tsy-hͿ
          exist-NEG=contrary-POT-NOM
          ‘there won’t (be a recording session tomorrow, only later)’ (t)Because this morpheme involves the notion of tense or aspect it is discussed
further in (5.5.28.). The next example combines -ƭ- with -he- but it may just as
well have been -ihƭ- pronounced rapidly:(2852)    hako're     'saBaDo      'hehͿsi a-'he-ƭ-tsy-re
          tomorrow Saturday        well      exist-NEG-NEG-POT-INT          (t)
          ‘tomorrow is Saturday, therefore there won’t be (recording for now)?’
7.1.3. The negative habitual element -hӻsiThere is a rare verbal negative element -hͿsi. It replaces the mood marker and
has a negative value. It acts as a “negative mood” inflexion with a connotation
of permanence. Compare the following examples:(2853)    atsuka-'ko kui-'nãi        'e-da-hͿ-he-'ki
          sugar-INS drink-NOM have-1S-NOM-NEG-DEC
          ‘I don’t drink coffee with sugar’
538   7. Other morphosyntactic structures(2854)   ka'wİ     atsuka-'ko 'kui-da-hͿsi
         coffee sugar-INS drink-1S-NEG
         ‘I don’t drink coffee with sugar anyway’The first example, which represents a habitual construction, can be uttered in a
context where the hearer was not able to offer sugar. In the second example, the
hearer declares that he is not willing to provide sugar. Note that the second ex-
ample apparently also has a habitual sense. Compare the following examples:(2855)   'mã      e-'he-da-ta         ere'ri-da-ki
         mother have-NEG-1S-CSO grow-1S-DEC
         ‘I grew up without a mother’(2856)   mã       'e-da-ta        ere'ri-da-hͿ'si
         mother have-1S-CSO grow-1S-NEG
         ‘I grew up without a mother’ (t)In both examples the speaker grew up in permanent absence of a mother. The
following examples also transpire the sense of permanent absence:(2857)   'a-da-hͿsi                      (2858)        ere'ri-a-hͿsi
         exist-1S-NEG                                  grow-1P-NEG
         ‘I lived alone/without parents’               ‘we are not tall’
         (lit. ‘I’m not at home’)(2859)   mã       u'nͿteta-a-nãi      jã'si-a-hͿsi
         mother converse-1P-NOM hear-1P-NEG
         ‘one never heard a mother tell stories’ (t)(2860)   'ƭwã    'nãi-tse ti-'nãi-tsy-rjͿ      nͿ-'nwͿ-hͿ
         nothing like-DEC what-NOM-GER-CD:area big-CL:tree-NOM         'a-hͿsi       o'tsi-ja-tsy-re=tja 'ta-wa-si
         exist-NEG kill-IO-POT-INT=CSO talk-IS-SWR                          (t)
         ‘“he’s lying, from where would a big tree be smashing us?” they said’Apparently, the morpheme -hͿsi indicates negative habituality, or the fact that a
negative situation lasts for some time. The final example is not entirely incom-
patible with this interpretation:(2861)   mani'ni-tsumãi 'e-a-ta             Ǌmã'tİ-a-hͿsi    mani'ni-tsumãi
         fish-CL:point have-1P-CSO          fish-1P-NEG      fish-CL:point

          ‘I did not fish using a hook, because I lost the hook’313The element -si as part of the negative permanence marker cannot be confused
with the homophonous switch reference marker -si since the latter does not re-
quire a preceding element -hͿ-, and does not have a negative value.","[574, 575, 576, 577]"

3.2.1. Bound morphemesThere are three types of bound morphemes in Kwaza: roots, suffixes and pre-
fixes. The roots have usually a lexical semantic content, whereas the affixes
tend to have a more abstract grammatical content. From a semantic perspective,
the distinction is not absolute, since there are also affixes with a highly lexical
content, which is in contrast to certain semantically rather empty roots.
    Roots can be subdivided further. The canonical verbal roots constitute one
of the two big open word classes. The bound roots represent a specific type that
consists of three closed classes of specific verb roots which require further
derivation by a nominaliser, a classifier or an attributive morpheme. Only
thereafter may they (non-obligatorily) receive person and mood inflexions.
This type includes genuine numeral roots, demonstrative roots and a number of
roots which have an “adjectival” semantic content. A third type is represented
by the two dummy roots nãi- ‘to be like’ and jã- ‘to be’, which have auxiliary
functions in the sentence and which also occur in many expressions. The final
type is represented by the noun formative empty root e- and the adverb forma-
tive empty root a-.
    Suffixes can be further subdivided into inflexional and derivational suffixes.
Although there is no sharp boundary between these categories, one can roughly
say that derivational suffixes are facultative and their application modifies the
meaning and/or the category of the word, whereas inflexional suffixes are in
principle obligatory and do not modify the word’s meaning but indicate the
syntactic function of sentence constituents. In the present work the inflexional
suffixes are considered not to have category changing properties, because when
attached to noun roots, they form inflected nouns, and when attached to verb
roots they form inflected verbs. However, noun roots may receive verb inflex-
ions and then function as verb roots without any other grammatical marking. I
considered this as zero-verbalisation, i.e.: verbalisation is the default value of
category change in absence of a specific verbalising morpheme. This approach
is possible, because change into one of the the other categories is always ac-
companied by specific nominalising or adverbialising morphemes.
    The demonstrative proximal and distal prefixes are the only proper prefixes
in Kwaza. Apart from these, certain concomitants of compounded roots may
behave as either prefixes or suffixes.
                                                     3.2. Types of morphemes      97   Note that in Kwaza, reduplication is not only defined by phonotactic
boundaries, i.e. it does not exclusively concern reduplication of roots or sylla-
bles. Also certain bound morphemes such as person markers can be redupli-
cated, as a special grammatical means to express aspectual and temporal differ-
ences. This is discussed in section (7.3.).

98      3. Parts of speech and constituent order3.2.2. Distribution of morphemesWithin the word, the facultative derivational morphemes occur basically be-
tween the root on the left and the inflexions on the right. The example below
shows the canonical relative position of morphemes inside the noun and the
verb:(27) atxitxi'mu            kui'nãxare
     atxitxi-mu            kui-nã-xa-re
     maize-CL:liquid       drink-FUT-2-INT
     Noun-Classifier       Verb-Tense-Person-Mood
     ROOT-DERIVATION       ROOT-DERIVATION-INFLEXION-INFLEXION
     ‘do you want to drink maize chicha?’ (HYPOTETICAL EXAMPLE)Although much more research still has to be done with regard to morpheme po-
sitions, it is possible to make a few general statements.
    In nouns, the first morpheme is usually the obligatory noun root. Thereafter
derivational morphemes may follow, such as possessive and attributive. In the
subsequent positions classifiers or a nominaliser or other derivational mor-
phemes may occur. If relevant, the noun may be terminated by an object argu-
ment case or oblique case inflexion. The obligatory slots are in bold print:Table 13. Morpheme positions in the noun
ROOT                     DERIVATION           DERIVATION             INFLEXION

                         attributive          classifier             oblique case
                         classifier
                         otherIn canonical verbs there are more positions. First comes an obligatory root.
Thereafter optional derivational morphemes follow, such as directional, classi-
fier, attributive, tense, modality, aspect, valency change, object person and
negative morphemes, more or less in that order. Thereafter come the obligatory
subject person and the word-final mood inflexions. In certain constructions,
derivational elements such as the negative morpheme and a tense, modality or
aspect morpheme occur between the person and mood inflexions.","[134, 135, 136]"

7.7.2. Tail-head linking hehӻsi ‘well’As will be demonstrated in (8.3.2.3.1.) the switch-reference mood marker -si is
used not only to indicate discontinuity of the grammatical function of subject
across the sentence, but also to resume continuity or to indicate discontinuity of
pragmatic aspects of the preceding utterances. It seems that this function led to
a new particle, hehͿ'si ‘well, then, in that case’. One possible analysis is that
this particle has developed out of a combination of the switch reference mood
marker -si and the semantically relatively empty verb stem ehͿ- ‘make, do’.(3188)   e=ehͿ-'si          e'nãi-tja-ta=da-hͿ-ki
         RED=make-SWR       quarrel-TRA-CSO=1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘he did (what he was not supposed to do) so I quarreled with him’Under another, more attractive analysis the particle is a semi-lexicalised com-
bination of -he- ‘NEG’, -hͿ- ‘NOM’ and -si ‘SWR’, which has developed out of
an elliptic construction (see also 7.5.), such as:(3189)   jere'xwa axe-'hͿ-hata-he-hͿ-'si                  o'nİ-e-tsy-'tse
         jaguar find-NOM-3S.2O-NEG-NOM-SWR return-again-POT-DEC
         ‘because jaguar saw you he will return again (to grab you)’
         (lit. ‘he did not just see you, he will return for you’)
                                                                 7.7. Particles   599Whatever the analysis, the pragmatic use of hehͿsi or ehͿsi ‘well’ resembles
“Tail-head linking” devices such as witnessed by De Vries (1989:204) in cer-
tain Papuan languages. Note the following elliptic example in a dialogue:(3190)    Q: ja        ja-xa-re            A: danͿ ja-'he-da-ki
             already eat-2-INT                still eat-NEG-1S-DEC
             ‘did you already eat?’           ‘I have not yet eaten’          C: he-hͿ-'si        ja-'ra
             NEG-NOM-SWR eat-IMP
             ‘well then (since (you) didn’t), eat!’As will also be shown in (8.3.2.3.1.), the elliptic particle can still bear person
marking:(3191)    R: he'?ai-da-'ki=tja         y'ro=nãi-le-dy-ta
             not.want-1S-DEC=CSO cry=like-only-DS-CSO
             ‘“I dont want to (go)” he said, crying like that’          C: 'xa-he-hͿ-si        jahİ-leja-da-'ki=tja       'ta-ta
             2-NEG-NOM-SWR hide-2O.FUT-1S-DEC=CSO talk-CSO
             ‘“well O.K. then (if you don’t want to go away), I’m going to hide
             you” she said’ (t)The combination 'xahehͿ'si was even translated once in isolation by the con-
sultant as ‘so you’, or ‘thus’. Both the meaning of the examples and the posi-
tion of the optional second person marker suggest that -he- concerns the coun-
ter of a supposition rather than the negation of an event (see also 7.1.1.2.).
About the following example, the consultant explained that it is uttered “when
one at first did not want to go, but suddenly decided to go after all”:(3192)    'he-hͿ-si            hͿ'dİ
          NEG-NOM-SWR          go!
          ‘well then, let’s go!’
7.7.3. Selective hele ‘or’The particle hele ‘or’, was only attested in the following examples:(3193)    barerini'tİ 'ja-da-tsy-re     'hele atxitxi'?Ǌ   'ja-da-tsy-tehere
          pancake      eat-1S-POT-INT or       rice        eat-1S-POT-APPR

          hunt-1S-POT-APPR        or     sleep-1S-POT-APPR
          ‘either I will go hunting or I will go to sleep’Note that accent is on the ultimate syllable when the particle is elicited in iso-
lation: [he'le] ‘or’. It could be that hele derives etymologically from a combi-
nation of negative -he- with preconditional -lİ.","[636, 637, 638]"

                                                 7.5. Morphological ellipsis   581Note with respect to (3126) that the expression of negation under ellipsis was
discussed thoroughly in section (7.1.1.3.). Note also that person cross-reference
markers never occur as elliptic forms by themselves, but that they are always
followed by mood markers. Finally, it should be emphasised that such bound
morpheme sequences only build a phrase by itself in the proper context. Con-
sider the following examples:(3128)   e-'xy       'dai-ty-taxwa-hͿ-ta'dy=jã-ki
         Ø-CL:leaf grab-DET-IS.1O-NOM-EXCL=be-DEC
         ‘without me knowing he took my money but now I discovered it!’(3129)   ta'dy=jã-ki
         EXCL=be-DEC
         ‘that’s it indeed!’About (3129), the consultant said that it is ungrammatical as such, but that it
can be uttered after someone told you something which you already know.
    The interpretation of elliptic expressions may also depend on more prag-
matic, extralinguistic factors of the context. The following utterances represent
a response to the general (speech) behaviour of the hearer:(3130)   xa-'he-tsy-tse      İ-'ra    mã         ca'ri-hata-'tsi

            ‘“well then, I will show (him to you)”‘ (t)
7.5.2.2. Resumptive particlesIn running monologue, combinations of person and cosubordinative mood
marking are sometimes used as resumptive particles. They link sentences, and
they are often translated by consultants as ‘and then, well, I, then I, so I, she,
well you, and thereafter, yes’ etc. Although these “inflected particles” cannot
be regarded as elements which remain when a root is omitted, they are elliptic:

the following example, the consultant said “if one would have said si ‘I’, this
would have been too strong, as it would mean ‘I myself’”:(3133)    a-'he-xa-wy      oja'nͿ-da-day-hͿ-'ki            da-ta  'Ǌi-da-ta

          ‘I came here when you were away, then, I slept, and went away
          again’ (long ago)All subject persons can occur in resumptive particles, as long as the mood
marker is the cosubordinative:(3134)    e'nãi-tja-ja-tsy-'tse      a-xa-'ta    areta-'nã-a-xa-ki

          ‘he is going to quarrel with one, so we, we’re going to learn’The resumptive particle construction is possibly related to cliticisation, as dis-
cussed in (7.5.2.3.), and to quoted speech like constructions, as discussed in
(5.5.11-14.). The monitory mood version of the embedded clause in (3134) re-
sults in a “preventive” construction (see 5.2.9.1.):(3135)    e'nãi-tja-eteja-'tsi-xa-xa-ta        areta-'nã-xa-xa-ki

          ‘for him not to quarrel with us, therefore you’re going to learn’Note that the impersonal subject marker -na- does not occur in resumptive par-
ticles or as a clitic. From the comparison of (3135) with the following example,
it becomes clear that this function is taken over by the verb root jã- ‘to be’:337336.This sentence was uttered by a mother to her son, explaining why she separated from
    his father.

           ‘for him not to quarrel with us, therefore one is going to learn’It is also important to notice that in the third person, -tja is used instead of zero

   ‘they arrived there and dried maize, so, she was drying the maize while sud-
   denly it popped (loudly): “bang!”‘ (t)It is worthwhile to note here that Mario once said that tja was an equivalent of
the adverbial hesitation interjection haryky ‘now’, ‘uhh..’. It may be that the
origin of the resumptive particles lies in quoted speech constructions. This is
also discussed to a certain extent in (8.3.1.9.).
    Maybe these resumptive particles should really be called anticipating parti-
cles, since they resume a person marker that is actually going to come only
later, in the matrix predicate. It is interesting to consider in this respect the dif-
ferent subject marker -dy-, which occurs exclusively in cosubordinated clause
chains and is never encountered as a part of matrix clause inflexion. It does not
indicate that the present subject is different from the former subject, but that the
next subject will be different from the present. In the next example, the differ-
ent subject cosubordinative marker even occurs twice as a “resumptive” parti-
cle:(3139)     hary'ky 'tana hͿ-'dy-ta             'nãi-ta bu-'dy-damͿ

    put forward in (5.1.7.) and (7.2.11.).
338.This fact represents further corroboration of the statements made in section (8.3.1.4.)
    to the effect that -tja is not only a manner adverbial clause marker, but also a fully
    fledged cosubordinative marker.
584    7. Other morphosyntactic structures          ‘then, well, like that he made the nuts starting to fall, but then ...
          (someone else did something totally different)’ (t)Here the omitted root is unidentifiable. The inflexions occur as abstract con-
junctional particles whose only function is to indicate that the next clause has a
different subject.339 From the point of view of the cosubordinate marker, how-
ever, these elliptic elements can be seen as resumptive. The cosubordinate
marker reminds the hearer of the fact that everything which precedes is part of
the same medial clause chain, regardless of whether any matrix moods have al-
ready passed by. The real end of this clause chain is only the final matrix clause
of the entire story. Even when the story is interrupted by a listener posing a
question, it can be resumed by a resumptive particle:(3140)    S: aru-'rjͿ-wa-hͿ-herejã-re
             place-CD:area-IS-NOM-APPL-INT

             yes       IS-CSO night-IDS-CSO
             ‘yes, then they, when night falls ...’ (t)So the elements which I have called “resumptive” here, both have a prospective
property, which is expressed in the person marker, and a resumptive property,
which is expressed in the cosubordination marker.
   Note that veritable omission of a root can have a truly resumptive effect:(3141)    areta-'he-da-kywy 'si-dy-hͿ tã'jã e'nãi-tja-ta-tsy-tse [...]

          ‘if I don’t learn, my chief will quarrel with me ..., he will with me, so
          I, I’m going to learn’In this example, the inflexional part of the last predicate of a clause is repeated
after a short pause, the event is in fact resumed, in order to connect it as back339.See (8.3.2.1.5.) and (8.3.2.2.1.) for the “discontinuative” function of the different
    subject marker and the inflected swith reference mood when used as a resumptive
    particle.
340.The purposive construction is explained in (5.5.12.).

is repeated, but the root omitted could be taken to symbolise such back-
grounding in an iconical manner.341
7.5.2.3. CliticisationThere are several grammatical constructions in which person and/or mood oc-
cur relatively deep inside the predicate. These are morphological constructions
which contain multiple person and mood markers, such as the quoted speech
constructions:(3142)     kukuihͿ-da-'ki-da-ki
           ill-1S-DEC-1S-DEC
           ‘I said I am ill’In this example, the grammatical subject of the quoted utterance, the speaker
and the person who quotes are identical. If the quoted person would be a sec-
ond person, the construction would be as follows (note that this alternative ex-
ample was constructed by myself):(3143)     kukuihͿ-da-'ki-xa-ki
           ill-1S-DEC-2-DEC
           ‘you said “I am ill”‘If the grammatical subject of the quoted utterance would be a second person,
the construction would be reversed, as follows (note that this example was con-
structed by myself):(3144)     kukuihͿ-xa-'ki-da-ki
           ill-2-DEC-1S-DEC
           ‘I said “you are ill”‘Also the declarative mood markers can be exchanged for any other mood
marker. In section (5.5.11.) the quoted speech constructions are discussed thor-
oughly. In (5.5.11.1.) the hypothesis is elaborated upon that these constructions
originate from ellipsis of a verb root for ‘to speak’.","[617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623]"

5.5.28.   Temporary contrast ihƭ-There is a verb root ihƭ- ‘on the contrary, it isn’t like that, wait!’, which often
occurs as a second element in compounds. It has a negative value which is dis-
cussed in (7.1.2.) and it is also encountered in certain negative imperative con-
structions illustrated in (5.2.7.).
    In addition to a negative sense, ihƭ- has some further interrelated connota-
tions. In the first place, it has a contrastive semantic value, i.e. it negates a pre-
sumed presupposition. Secondly, the negation it expresses may be only tempo-
rary. The following example is from a dialogue in which TE explains why the
next day is not suitable for work:

                 ‘therefore there won’t be’ (t)In the second, the sixth and the eighth utterances of this dialogue, ihƭ- expresses
a temporary counter of supposition. They suggest that, for the time being, it is
not a good day to resume the work. But later, i.e. after tomorrow, it is.
    Note that the counter of supposition is not necessarily of temporary value:(2367)    wa'txi-re     hudada-'nãi        e-'re    txana-'nãi   ƭ'wã

5.5.29.    Contrastive -hehӻThere is a verbal morpheme -hehͿ, which replaces the mood marker. It ex-
presses contrast:(2370)     R:     tsewe-dy-'tõi-hata-tsi

                  place-REF-CL:eye-1S-CONT
                  ‘but I have glasses!’The element -he- of the morpheme looks like a negative morpheme and -hͿ
looks like a nominaliser. However, -hehͿ does not have any nominalising prop263.The traditional initiation of boys includes these ingredients. Only a few people in the
    A.I. Tubarão-Latundê are old enough to have undergone initiation.
460    5. The verb phraseerties. Furthermore, it is not negative, but it may have retained one property of
the negative in that it involves the rejection of a presupposition. The fact that
person cross-reference morphemes only precede the morpheme and the fact
that the element -he- does not bear stress also suggest this:(2371)    a'wͿi-wa-hehͿ                (*awͿi'hewahͿ)
          see-IS-CONT
          ‘they are looking’Countersupposition is discussed in (7.1.1.2.). Note that the contrast does not
have to be very strong:(2372)    Q:     tsǊhǊ-ra'ti kui-xa-'re              A:      ka'wİ    'kui-da-hehͿ

                 ‘what are you drinking?’                    ‘I’m drinking coffee!’The sentence ka'wİ 'kuidahehͿ ‘I’m drinking coffee!’ would not be a proper re-
ply to a warning that it is not real coffee, but oil, or poison.264 In the following
excerpt from a conversation the contrastive morpheme is used twice:(2373)    TE:    'deda          hanã'wã-na       'bou-tsy-rati

sition the hearer TE is holding that the speaker ME knows the story of the ori264.In that case the answer would have been kawİ kuidaki ‘I drink coffee’ or kawİki ‘it’s

knows about its existence through her only, and later ME did tell it. The second

7.1.1. The negative suffix -he-The negative suffix -he- occurs in two different basic types of constructions.
One expresses straightforward negation, and the other involves a counter of
presupposition. These constructions are formally distinct. In the negative con-
struction, the suffix -he- attracts stress, it occurs in a position between the verb
root and person inflexion, and if the subject is a zero-marked third person, the
declarative mood marker is -tse. In the countersupposition construction, the
suffix -he- does not bear stress, it occurs in the position between person in-
flexion and the mood marker, and the declarative mood marker is -ki under all
circumstances. This situation can be schematised as follows:

Kwaza seems to be very rare among the Amazonian languages (see van der
Voort 2002b). Alternative placements of the negative and other morphemes
such as derivational future -nã- have been seldomly attested and have not yet
been the object of research.","[557, 558]"

tory, can be regarded as prohibitive. The prohibitive moods are more or less the
negative equivalents of persuasive moods. There are a number of systematic
and idiomatic correspondences and differences. As a systematic difference in
the first place, there is no special negative volitive. A predictable negative
equivalent of the volitive was neither attested. Consequently, first person sin-
gular and first person exclusive arguments have not been encountered at all in
                                                                    5.2. Mood   327any of the prohibitive moods as subject. As an object, however, the first person
singular has been attested in the monitory mood, marked conspicuously by the
imperative first person singular object cross-reference morpheme -ta?Ϳ-.
    As a second difference it is remarkable that almost none of the productive
prohibitive mood markers is immediately traceable to the sum of negation and
persuasive mood. Under negation, persuasive mood-markers are suppleted by
different mood markers, like -ky and -tsi, or, alternatively, negation itself is
marked differently, as by -i- or by zero-marking. Therefore, the prohibitive is
not predictable or, in another relatively improper use of the term, “analytic”.
    The prohibitive corresponds to the persuasive insofar as none of the moods
cover the entire range of formally possible subjects, and that the different
moods complement one another in that they go with different mutually exclu-
sive subjects. This complementary aspect which is shared among the prohibi-
tive roots, is also semantically motivated.
    With respect to their possible subject ranges the prohibitive moods never-
theless complement one another in a slightly different way than do the persua-
sive moods. There is an apparent overlap between monitory and negative im-
perative with respect to the second person singular. This is not a true overlap,
however, because the second person singular subject of the monitory is not a
“controlling” subject, whereas the one of the negative imperative is. The two
other negative imperative mood expressions with second person singular are
the exceptional “analytic” one as attested in example (1371), and the rather
lexicalised element ƭhƭky. Also the third person subject of a prohibitive mood is
covered by two moods: apart from the monitory, there is a lexicalised negative
exhortative expression ending in -ini.
    Finally the negative equivalents of the imperative and the exhortative tend
to be represented by the negative imperative and the monitory respectively.
This pattern is disturbed for the zero-marked subjects, where alternative ex-
pressions are possible. The negative exhortative seems quite rare.
    In the following table, all canonical combinations of subject cross-reference
and prohibitive mood marking are united. Slots containing a single hyphen in-
dicate that the expression of cross-reference is zero. The hyphen on one of the
second person singular subject abbreviations indicates that the verb is not
“controlled” whereas the plus added to the other one indicates that the subject
does “control” the verb.","[364, 365]"

7.5.2.4. Abstract ellipsisAbout elliptic responses as discussed in (7.5.2.1.), one could say that the spe-
cific root is physically absent but that it is understood, and identifiable from the
context. About quoted speech as discussed in (7.5.2.3.) one could maintain that
a verb root of speech was deleted. However, most quoted speech constructions
would be ungrammatical without such deletion, because it would result in jux-
taposition of matrix clause predicates. Finally, it seems that the resumptive use
of inflexions as discussed in (7.5.2.2.) does not involve easily identifiable
omitted verb roots at all. In the present subsection I will discuss some root
omissions which may be even more abstract.
    In section (8.2.2.3.) concessive adverbial clause constructions involving the
subordinator =wara ‘but’ are discussed. This element is always preceded by a
nominaliser, usually -hͿ. The nominaliser is normally preceded by the verbal
root of the adverbial clause predicate. However, the morphological complex
-hͿ=wara can also occur independently, as a concessive conjunctional particle,
forming a link between sentences or sections of the discourse. Although this is
also amply illustrated in (8.2.2.3.) I will give an example of it here:(3151)    oja-e'te-da-tsy-tse        zezƭju-dy-'rjͿ      hͿ=wara

          want.not-1S-DEC
          ‘we are going together to Zezinho, but I don’t want to, no’    The same abstract kind of ellipsis was observed in quoted speech construc-
tions, when the verbal root of the quoted phrase was omitted. Compare the
following examples from (8.1.2.2.):(3152)    la'to        'masiju kukuihͿ-da-'ki-tsy-hͿ-ki
          yesterday Marcio ill-1S-DEC-GER-NOM-DEC
          ‘yesterday, Marcio said he is ill’

          GER-NOM-DEC
          ‘he says yes / he says so’Example (3153) can be used as if tsy- were a verb root meaning ‘to say’ or a
third person singular cross-reference morpheme. It may be an elliptic version of
(3311), but it may apparently also function as a response to questions like ‘was
Marcio ill yesterday?’:(3154)    la'to       tsicwata     'masiju kukui'hͿ-hͿ-re
          yesterday begin-CSO Marcio ill-NOM-INT
          ‘did Marcio become ill yesterday?’(3155)  tsy-'hͿ-ki
        GER-NOM-DEC
        ‘he says so / it is said’344
The same situation exists with respect to the following examples:(3156)    tsy-'nãixwa-wa-ki                   (3157)      'tse-cwa-ki
          GER-SIMU-IS-DEC                                 DEC-IS-DEC
          ‘they pretend to be talking’                    ‘it is said (that...)’Speech quotations can be extended also with further morphology, e.g. the frus-
trative morpheme -le- (see 8.2.2.2.). Compare the following examples:(3158)    haru'wi 'ja-a-tsy-'tse-tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
          Luiz      eat-1P-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘Luiz invited us for dinner, now what to do?’ (it isn’t possible)(3159)    tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
          GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘he said that; however, unfortunately I can’t’, ‘what a pity’Example (3159) is the elliptic version of (3158), but it can also be uttered for
example as an elliptic response to someone saying ‘Luiz invited us to eat!’, as
if it were a lamentative predicate itself.
     Also other morphemes, such as repetitive -je?e- ‘again’ and negative -he-
followed by person and mood marking can occur elliptically, without there be-
ing a specific verb root which is understood:(3160)    je'?e-wa-si
          again-IS-SWR
          ‘they explained again’, ‘they did it again’ (etc.)344.Although the consultant added that hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes’ would have been a better answer.

         again-1S-DEC                                   NEG-1P-NOM-AO
         ‘I (spoke, did, etc.) again’                   ‘when one is nothing’   Finally it was suggested in (5.2.3.4.) and (5.5.11.1.) that certain verbs of
speech may have derived from elliptic constructions. These verbs, and also
modal verb roots like damͿ- in (3150) can still be considered as elliptic in a
way. However, the actual omission may have become so abstract as to be only
symbolic now.","[626, 627, 628]"

8.6.2. ExplicativeThe verb root nãi- ‘to be like’/’to do thus’ has an abstract semantic content, and
can be used as a dummy verb in all situations where it is clear from the narra-
tive or pragmatic context what it means:(3738)    'nãi-cwa-ta      'nãi-wa-hͿ-herejã-re
          like-IS-CSO      like-IS-NOM-APPL-INT
          ‘that’s how it happened to him’ (that’s how he fared)Medial clauses often function as a complement of reason in cosubordination
with the matrix clause. If the matrix predicate is based on the verb root nãi- ‘to
be like’/’to do thus’, the construction V-CSO nãi- ‘it is because V’ is used in the
discourse to inform about or to explain the background to a certain situation.
Consider the following little dialogues:(3739)    Q: ti-'nãi-tja     'nãi-re              A: hy'ja-ta 'nãi-ki
             what-NOM-CSO like-INT                   fall-CSO like-DEC
             ‘how did it happen to him?’             ‘he fell, that is how it went’(3740)    Q: tsǊhǊ-'du-xa-ta    kunͿ-'djo-xa-re
             what-BER-2-CSO dress-CL:foot-2-INT
             ‘why are you putting on shoes?’          A: hyhyrwa-'nã-da-ta     'nãi-da-ki
             move-FUT-1S-CSO       like-1S-DEC
             ‘because I’m going for a walk’The verb root can also be the first member of a compound. In that case the sec-
ond member explicitates the background:(3741)    ho'hͿ-xa-ta    nãi=tsasi-'he-xa-re
          shy-2-CSO      like=follow-NEG-2-INT
          ‘you don’t come with us because you are shy?’
8.6.3. IndignantThere are several emphatic constructions which express indignation over the
fact that the hearer is not aware of something. The most important ones involve
the interrogative mood and the verb jã- ‘to be’ and were discussed in
                                                    8.6. Specific constructions   711(5.5.14.3.). The construction discussed here also involves clefting use of jã-.
Furthermore, it may contain emphatic use of the interrogative, a switch refer-
ence construction, an embedded cosubordinative construction, and the verb
nãi- ‘to be like’ often occurs as the matrix predicate root. The entire framework
of this construction can be summarised as:(3742)   V-ta        a-'re=jã-si           'nãi-xa-re
         verb-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
         ‘do you suppose that it is really the case that V?’The verb jãsi ‘it is’ is represented here as cliticised to the preceding one be-
cause of the stress pattern. Main stress is on the preceding interrogative marker.
Note that in this construction the preceding verb a're ‘is there?’ is usually pro-
nounced as [ã'4Ӂ] or [Ó'4Ӂ], probably because of the nasality of the subsequent
verb root jã-.
   This construction expresses indignation over a presupposition held by the
hearer. Consider the following examples:(3743)   'mİ̘-ta a-'re=jã-si           'nãi-xa-re
         hit-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
         ‘he did not hit me, no!’ (S does not want to admit it)
         (lit. ‘do you perhaps suppose that he hit me?’)(3744)   tsuhǊ-'du-xa-ta      oja'nͿ-xa-re     mã
         what-BER-2-CSO       come-2-INT       mother         awͿi=ba'ru=asa-hata-tsy-hͿ-ta   a-'re=jã-si
         see=end=leave-3S.2O-POT-NOM-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR         'nãi-xa-re=tja      'ta-ta    'İ-ra=tja       'ta-hͿ=wara
         like-2-INT=CSO      talk-CSO go-IMP=CSO       talk-NOM=but
         ‘“why the hell have you come?, mother is not just going to have a
         look at you, no!”, she said, “go away!” she said, but...’ (t)The latter example is from a traditional tale in which a young boy is searching
his mother, but his grandmother warns him, because the mother is likely to kill
the boy upon first sight. Through this construction she emphatically rejects the
boy’s presupposition that the mother will also want to see him.
   Not all ingredients of the framework as represented in (3742) are obligatory.
Consider the following examples in which there is no matrix predicate:(3745)   'kawİ         'kui-tsy-hͿ-'ta       a-'re=jã-si
         coffee drink-POT-NOM-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR
         ‘he isn’t going to drink coffee, no!’
         (lit. ‘it is to be questioned that he is going to drink coffee’)
712    8. Subordination and coordination(3746)    'kawİ    'kui-da-tsy-hͿ-'ta        a-'re=jã-si
          coffee drink-1S-POT-NOM-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR
          ‘I (know I’m) not going to drink coffee!’(3747)    waja-ha'ta-tsy-hͿ-'ta         a-'re=jã-si
          bring-3S.2O-POT-NOM-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR
          ‘he is not going take you there, no (it’s a pity)’Also the cosubordinative construction may be left out:(3748)    a-'re=jã-si
          exist-INT=be-SWR
          ‘I don’t know whether there is (any food etc.)’(3749)    kukui-'dy-da-rai-re=jã-si               'nãi-xa-re
          hurt-BEN-1S-damn-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
          ‘it doesn’t hurt, no!’416 (lit. ‘do you perhaps suppose that it hurts?’)(3750)    atsi'le-ki      jã-he-rai-'re      jã-'si   'nãi-xa-re
          heavy-DEC be-NEG-damn-INT be-SWR like-2-INT
          ‘it is very heavy, I’m telling you!’
          (lit. ‘it is heavy: do you perhaps suppose that it bloody isn’t?’)In these constructions, the interrogative marker is used emphatically, and the
negative connotation is not marked overtly in the morphology. In a way, the
interrogative marker expresses strong negation, and the literal translation of
(3745) is not entirely realistic. Although these constructions may have a nega-
tive value, no negative morpheme is involved unless the element -si should be
related to negative -hͿsi (see 7.1.3.), and should not represent a switch-
reference marker. However, there is no formal reason to assume that there is
morphologically marked negation here:(3751)    ti-'nãi-da-lİ         axe'hͿ-da-tsy-re jã-si     'nãi-xa-re
          what-NOM-1S-PREC meet-1S-POT-INT be-SWR like-2-INT
          ‘well how would I meet her, do you suppose?’ (t)
          (lit. ‘how do you suppose I could meet her?’)The following example indicates that the presumed switch reference marker
does not have to be present at all:
416.One does not normally want to admit it if one is in pain.

          ‘I don’t know what fish I’ve eaten’
          (lit. ‘it being a question what fish I’ve eaten’)Finally, it appears that the root jã- is not necessarily cliticised to an interroga-
tive structure:(3753)    tsuhǊ-'du-xa-lİ nãi-xa-'he-tsy-tse 'xyi-dy-hͿ

          she said’ (t)In this example, which is from the same text as (3744), the grandmother is try-
ing to convince her daughter of not killing her own son. She tries to work on
the daughter’s consciousness by emphasising the fact that the boy is her son
and that he has searched for her in spite of the danger.
    I see any negative interpretation of variants of the indignant construction as
a side-effect of the interrogative clause to which jã- is attached. In these exam-
ples, which all involve indignation or categorical negation, the only obligatory
element is the root jã-.

5.2.9. MonitoryThe monitory mood is also one of the prohibitive moods. It is expressed by the
morpheme -tsi and it has a cautionary or admonitory value as it is used to warn
the hearer that something dangerous or unpleasant may happen. The zero-
marked person is the third person subject argument of the verb. Usually, the
subject is not identical with the hearer to whom the admonition is directed:(1497)    'hyja-'tsi                 (1498)       jere'xwa 'ja-tsi     auxwa'nã
          fall-MON                                jaguar eat-MON meat
          ‘don’t let him fall!’                   ‘don’t let the dog eat the meat!’
          (lit. ‘(watch out) he may fall!’)       (alternative order: 321)189.When pronounced angrily and fast: [nãi'nƭ wa4a'hӁkÓ].
190.The existence of an expression meaning ‘thanks’ is usually denied, so this may ap-
    proach a calque on POR não precisa! ‘you don’t have to do that’.
191.In case productive use were attested and (*)kui-i-ni were to mean ‘don’t you drink!’,
    then it would fit better in (5.2.7.).
                                                                        5.2. Mood    323(1499)    'kui-tsi                     (1500)     'kui-tsi      a'wͿi-tsy-tse
          drink-MON                               drink-MON see-POT-DEC
          ‘don’t let him drink!’                  ‘don’t let him have a look!’192On the discourse level, the hearer may be identical with an (involuntary!)
agent, as in example (1501), but there is no reason to suppose that this corre-
sponds to the grammatical subject, because exactly the same situation obtains
in example (1502). There the grammatical subject is cross-referenced explicitly
by -wa-, the indefinite subject, which can impossibly be identical with the ad-
dressed hearer:(1501)    'kãu-tsi                       (1502)       hy'ri-wa-tsi
          break-MON                                   steal-IS-MON
          ‘take care not to break it!’                ‘watch out, people here steal!’
          (lit. ‘(watch out) it may break!’)          (CX: said to a newcomer)It is nevertheless possible for the hearer to be identical with the grammatical
subject, but this will have to be marked overtly by -xa-:(1503)    'rai?ͿhͿ hewedu'tu-xa-'tsi
          thing     forget-2-MON
          ‘don’t forget your luggage!’(1504)    awe-'mǊ         o'hui-he-'ky     kikalo-'e-xa-tsi
          rain-CL:liquid play-NEG-NEI fever-again-2-MON
          ‘don’t go playing outside in the rain, lest you get fever again!’193It is important to notice that the verb root of the monitory phrase in the latter
example is (like the former) not “controlled” by the subject, whereas the verb
root of the negative imperative phrase is. In fact, the subject is the very same
second person singular in both members of the paratactic construction.194 How-
ever, monitory verbs can also have second person subjects when they are con-
trollable verbs. This construction has a negative imperative connotation. Com-
pare the following two examples:
192.This sentence is probably a calque on the POR expression: nãõ deixe ele tomar olho,
    lit. ‘don’t let him take(=drink) eye!’ (the Portuguese verb tomar means both ‘to take’
    and ‘to drink’).
193.This is the complete version of the warning ED sent to her little daughter: awe'mǊ
    he'ky ‘(because of the) rain, don’t!’.
194.The context in which this sentence was recorded gave no reason to doubt at the sin-
    gularity of its subject.
324    5. The verb phrase(1505)    a-'wy     ja-'tsi                    (1506)     a-'wy     'ja-xa-tsi
          Ø-time eat-MON                                  Ø-time eat-2-MON
          ‘before he eats’                                ‘don’t eat yet!’This construction may be somewhat idiomatic because of the adverb awy ‘yet’
(see 6.2.4.1.). On one such occasion, the monitory mood marker was encoun-
tered deeper inside the verb, as if it can also function as a (preventive) modal
suffix (see also 5.2.9.1.):(1507)    a-'wy      'wotsu-tsi-da-ta
          Ø-time skinny-MON-1S-CSO
          ‘I do it before they emaciate’ (t)   The verb in the monitory mood may cross-refer to any object argument, in-
cluding the second person who is identical with the hearer:(1508)    du'mã 'mİ̘-hata-'tsi
          snake     beat-3S.2O-MON
          ‘take care, the snake is going to hit you (don’t let him)!’Monitory -tsi combines with overt cross-reference to a second person subject
by -xa- like most other moods, but unlike the imperative -ra. In spite of this,
overt first person singular object cross-reference is realised through -ta?Ϳ-,
which is the same for the imperative195, whereas most other moods use -ta-, in-
cluding the negative imperative:(1509)    wa'dy-ta-he-'ky                         wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-tsi
          give-1O-NEG-NEI                         give-1SO-MON
          ‘don’t you give me!’                    ‘don’t you give me!’This suggests that the monitory mood in Kwaza does have something in com-
mon with the imperative on the grammatical level after all. And on the seman-
tic level, it is sometimes difficult to imagine how the hearer cannot be identical
with the agent subject which is zero-marked in the next example:(1510)    oxote-'hͿ-ta?Ϳ-tsi
          wait-NOM-1SO-MON
          ‘don’t wait for me!’Still, I suppose that zero-marked subjects of the monitory mood are formally
third person subjects. The fact that literal interpretations like those of the next195.Except that it is sometimes pronounced in the monitory as [ta!ƭ]. This was the case in
    examples (1511) and (1519), but for statistical reasons I considered /-ta?Ϳ-/ as the
    correct phonemic representation.
                                                                       5.2. Mood    325examples seem a bit far-fetched is not a valid argument against this analysis.
For one thing, Kwaza does not have a grammatical category of passive voice.(1511)    do-'hͿ-ta?Ϳ-tsi                 (1512)         mİ̘-ta?Ϳ-'tsi (*mİ̘taheky)
          leak-NOM-1SO-MON                               hit-1SO-MON
          ‘don’t leak (hot tea) on me!’                  ‘don’t you hit me!’ (‘take
          (‘don’t let me be leaked on!’?)                care not to let me be hit!’?)   To a great extent the monitory -tsi can also be regarded as a negative
equivalent of the exhortative -ni. Their contrast is highlighted by the following
minimal pair:(1513)    jere'xwa ja-'ni                     (1514)     jere'xwa ja-'tsi
          jaguar eat-EXH                                 jaguar eat-MON
          ‘let the dog eat!’                             ‘don’t let the dog eat!’The monitory has nearly the same formal characteristics in being inflexionable
for the same subject persons. The monitory certainly differs from the exhorta-
tive in that it can be combined with second person singular subject cross-
rerefence too, as attested by example (1504).
    The monitory is probably a matrix verb mood. The imminence of danger
can be explicitly connected with a preventive measurement in the form of an
imperative or negative imperative verb phrase:(1515)    ku'ri-ca-ra      janãnãi-'tsi
          quiet-EMP-IMP good-MON
          ‘take care, shut your mouth, otherwise you will be eaten up!’196(1516)    magariDa-'wã du'ru=wady-ra tã'lo-tsi            enãi-'ca-hata-tsi
          Margarida-AO pour=give-IMP sulk-MON quarrel-TRA-3S.2O-MON
          ‘pour Margarida (tea) lest she will sulk, lest she will quarrel!’(1517)    e'nãi-he-ky          bui-'tsi
          quarrel-NEG-NEI leave-MON
          ‘don’t quarrel lest he will leave!’These preventive verb phrases are in matrix verb moods too. Therefore, these
complex clauses probably do not represent grammatically hypotactic construc-
tions. When there is no such preventive complement clause, the monitory
phrase has an implicit preventive value itself. So bui'tsi will probably mean lit-
erally: ‘(if you don’t do something) he will leave!’. In this way it has an im-
plicit negative connotation, and as such the monitory mood can be argued to
belong to the prohibitive moods inventorised in (5.2.10.) below.","[360, 361, 362, 363]"

7.1.1.1. Negation by -he-Negation of predicates and propositions is realised through the bound verbal

          ‘he puts his foot fully on the ground’        ‘he hops, he limps’ (t)   Cases of double negation inside the word have not been found. Repetition of
the negative suffix is not possible:(2767)    *hoi-he-he-tse                      sweet-NEG-NEG-DEC          The antonyms of some verbs are expressed through litotes, i.e. by ne-
gation of the root through -he-:(2768)    tãi-ki                              tãi-'he-tse

‘weak’; mõ- ‘loud’, mõhe- ‘soft’; wai- ‘good’, waihe- ‘bad’. Similar phenom-
ena in Kanoê were discussed by Bacelar and Rodrigues da Silva (i.p.).
   It could be that in some verbs there is a lexicalised negative element, e.g.
hedutu- ‘lose’; hetxa- ‘bar’; hewedutu- ‘forget’; he?ai- ‘want not’.
   Some verbs contain the element -he- as an integral part of the root, but it has
nothing to do with the negative morpheme:

8.2.1.4. Chaining of conditional clausesAn “open” conditional sentence is formed through the chaining of an in princi-
ple infinite number of coordinated conditional antecedent phrases each ending
in the conditional verbal marker -kywy subordinated to a sentence-final conse-
quent matrix clause that contains an potential/future verbal morpheme -tsy-, or
an irrealis condition morpheme -rydy-. Other conditional phrases ending in -lİ
363.Note that the position of the negation morpheme -he- in this and the subsequent two
    examples indicates a counter of presupposition (see 7.1.1.)

quents.(3386)   atxi'txi   cͅrƭ-tsy-'hͿ   ja=hã'rã-xa-lİ         kohonǊ-'tsa

8.2.2. ConcessiveThere are several types of expressions with semantic values which approach
the concessive. They often involve the same morphological elements -lİ, -tsy-
and -hͿ again, which have been attested with widely different functions
throughout the grammar of Kwaza. It may be that these recurring morphemes
which are hard to identify acquire a specific meaning in particular constella-
tions and order of elements, and that these constellation types themselves must
be regarded as lexicalised with a certain meaning.
   The “canonical” concessive, which will be discussed first, involves an ad-
verbial clause ending in -lete. The next concessive construction is formed by
-lehͿ and has a frustrative connotation. The last concessive dealt with is formed
by -(hͿ)=wara and has a coordinating function.

coordinating concessive constructions has a functional basis, and that lan-
guages differ with respect to the division of labour between these constructions.
She argues convincingly that concession in Kwaza is expressed at clausal con-
tent level by -lete, and that at all higher semantic levels, to wit the epistemic,
speech-act and textual level, concession is indicated by -(hͿ)=wara (Crevels
2000:85-87).","[675, 676, 677]"

                             The verb phrase
Kwaza verbs can be morphologically highly complex and there are many dif-
ferent suffixes. A verb in Kwaza consists minimally of a bound root and
obligatory person and mood suffixes. Between the root and the obligatory suf-
fixes other, optional, suffixes may be inserted. The obligatory suffixes, which
can only be omitted when the speech context allows, are considered as inflex-
ional. The optional suffixes are considered as derivational. Their occurrence
depends on the specific state of affairs as described or expressed by the utter-
ance.
    The distinction between derivation and inflexion is not clear-cut. Valency
changing suffixes, aspectual suffixes, directionals and the like are optional, and
could be considered as derivational. Subject cross-reference151 markers and
mood markers are obligatory and could be considered as inflexional. Modal
suffixes and object cross-reference markers are to a certain extent optional and
they take a position inside the word between the derivational and inflexional
suffixes.
    Although I do not make an explicit and categorical formal distinction be-
tween derivational and inflexional morphemes, I do distinguish different types
of suffixes on the basis of an intuitive notion of the distinction. This is reflected
in the order by which the verbal morphemes will be treated in the subsequent
sections. First I will discuss the most inflexional of the suffixes, the person
cross-reference markers, in (5.1.). Mood (i.e. illocution) markers, which can
also be considered as inflexional, are discussed in (5.2.). Then, more deriva-
tional-like morphemes are discussed, such as directional morphemes in (5.3.),
valency changing suffixes in (5.4.), tense, modality and aspect morphemes in
(5.5.) and nominalisers in (5.6.).
    Even though negation in Kwaza can be considered as a verbal derivational
process, I have, because of its special formal and pragmatic characteristics,
relegated it to (7.1.).
    I regard those roots as verbal which are morphologically bound. From the
point of view of morphology, Kwaza verbs are not complete words if a nomi-
naliser, or person and mood marking is absent. In essence, “incomplete” stems
are not well-formed in Kwaza. Nevertheless, ellipsis of person and mood
marking occurs in certain contexts. This is discussed in another chapter, in
(7.5.).
    Semantically, verbal roots are either attributive or predicative. Kwaza verb
roots contrast morphologically with noun roots in that Kwaza nouns can occur151.In this work I have used the term “cross-reference” as in Shopen (1985) in the sense
    of “agreement” or “concord”.
244    5. The verb phraseby themselves. This morphological property of Kwaza nouns is related to their
referential meaning. Kwaza nouns are basically referring expressions. They can
also be used without morphological adaptation as attributive expressions, and,
when zero-verbalised as verb stems, they function as predicative expressions
(see 4.4.9.). Kwaza verbs may remain inflected for person under nominalisa-
tion.","[278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"

5.1.4.1. Indefinite subjectwa ‘IS’. The indefinite subject morpheme -wa- is often encountered as the sole
person inflexion on a verb. It indicates that the third person subject is not speci-
fied, only the semantic content of the predicate being of interest.(1103)    'kui-wa-'ki
          drink-IS-DEC
          ‘people are / someone is drinking’This utterance was made in a context in which the speaker went over to the
nearby house and heard or saw that there was a party going on, and upon re-
turning she informed the hearer about it (for reasons such as the hearer having
asked the speaker to see for him, or the speaker wanting to get the hearer to ac-
company her and join the party). In such a context, kuiki ‘they are / he is
drinking’ would have been less appropriate. So kuiwaki can be translated more
or less as ‘there is drinking going on’. Similar examples can be given:(1104)    dodotxi'te o'hui-ki              (1105)    dodotxi'te o'hui-wa-ki
          ball         play-DEC                      ball        play-IS-DEC
          ‘he/they are playing ball’                 ‘they (many) are playing ball’(1106)    a'wͿi-da-ki     a'rǊi-wã     mawdy'ne-wa-ta

          ‘I saw them call tapir to come to them’ (t)
156.But note that the interrogative pronoun di'lİ can be used with an indefinite sense in
    non-interrogative constructions (4.7.4.).

          ‘they are already eating                  ‘someone is already going

contexts in order to be able to explain the exact meaning and possible idiomatic
uses of the indefinite subject marker in every attested occurrence, than can be
done in the present work. As an example it was sometimes said that the addi-
tion of -wa- could be regarded as “respectful”. Nevertheless, there is an impor-
tant morphosyntactic clue which corroborates the “indefinite”-hypothesis of
-wa-: the indefinite morpheme does not cross-reference an overt argument. In
general, a definite argument is then unmentionable:(1111)    lu'zeu   mƭu      peri'Dauwa-wã wa'dy-ki
          Luzeu chicha Peridalva-AO give-DEC
          ‘Luzeu gave chicha to Peridalva’(1112)    *luzeu mƭu       peri'Dauwa-wã wa'dy-wa-ki

          Piu scream-NOM-DEC
          ‘Piu screamed’The following example contained -wa- even though both speaker and hearer
knew the identity of the subject (in this case Daniel Latundê):(1114)    ywy'nwͿ 'dy=asa-wa-ki
          tree    cut=leave-IS-DEC
          ‘someone/they cut the log and cleared it out of the way’Nevertheless, it is impossible to inquire about the identity of the subject while
using an indefinite cross-reference marker:157.Even if no-one knows who Luzeu is, this sentence is ungrammatical.

         who scream-IS-INT
         ‘who screamed?’This was also illustrated in (4.7.4.). However, some overt arguments can be re-
garded as indefinite:(1116)   txi'rja wy'ru-wa-re          (1117)     txi'rja-wa-ta
         everyone grind-IS-INT                   everyone-IS-CSO
         ‘everyone helps grinding?’ (t)          ‘being everyone / everyone is’There is no indefinite pronoun ‘someone’ or ‘nobody’. Instead, a nominalised
verbalisation of a noun may be used:(1118)   mãrİ̘ri'tsa-wa-hͿ kwİ'nİ-wa-ki
         human-IS-NOM      enter-IS-DEC
         ‘someone/a person entered (here, while we were away)’(1119)   Ǌcenãi-'he-wa-hͿ       ere're-wa-ki
         know-NEG-IS-NOM        write-IS-DEC
         ‘they are writing up that which nobody knows’Apparently, some nouns like wã ‘wasp’ can act as an indefinite subject. The
reason for this possibility is probably that when a swarm of wasps attacks, they
are not definite individuals any more, as far as the victim is concerned. So one
could say that the application of -wa- has a de-individualising effect. This may
also create a passive-like effect, though not more than that:(1120)   wã e'xyi-ki              (1121)      wã e'xyi-wa-ki
         wasp sting-DEC                       wasp sting-IS-DEC
         ‘the wasp stung him’,                ‘wasps stung him’,
         ‘it’s a wasp who stung him’          ‘he received stings from wasps’(1122)   wã-'wã e'xyi-wa-ki
         wasp-AO sting-IS-DEC
         ‘they stung the wasp’An alternative translation of (1121) had an indefinite object: ‘wasp stung
someone’. This may suggest a passive nature of -wa- (‘people were stung’) af-
ter all. However, the verb exyi- ‘sting (by wasp)’ is exceptional itself: the form
e'xyi-da-ki, with first person subject inflexion, both means ‘I stung (him)’ as ‘I
got stung’. It is probably because of the unusualness of the first, literal mean-
ing, that the second interpretation is enabled. Nevertheless, it is considered
more correct to use a first person object form in this case: e'xyi-ta-ki ‘I got
stung’ (lit. ‘stung me’). Also the result of nominalisation of certain verb stems
262   5. The verb phrasemay be ambiguous in this respect: it may refer to an object or to the subject, re-
gardless whether -wa- is present:(1123)   dutu're hãtsǊ-'hͿ           (1124)      dutu're hã'tsǊ-wa-'hͿ

         ‘I saw that pig which they skinned’These constructions were also discussed in (8.4.1.4.).
   Although I have found no evidence for a passive in Kwaza, it should be
mentioned that elicited translations of Portuguese passive sentences into Kwaza
often contain the element -wa-:(1127)   ecoto'hͿ-wa-ki     ca'ri-wa-ki       (1128)    tã'jã 'ta-wa-hͿ
         retaliate-IS-DEC   shoot-IS-DEC                chief say-IS-NOM

         ‘they killed him’                              ‘the one they call chief’When a truly definite subject is expressed in combination with indefinite sub-
ject reference -wa-, this subject is part of a group functioning as an indefinite
subject:(1129)   lato-'wy          pju ohui'nƭ-wa-ta
         yesterday-time Piu play-IS-CSO
         ‘yesterday, Piu and the others were playing’
         (lit. ‘yesterday Piu they were playing’)This may create the impression that the element -wa- is a plural marker:(1130)   i'grezja-'na e'tay  'tswa-cwa-ta 'nãi-wa-ki
         church-LOC woman man-IS-CSO          like-IS-DEC

phology of Kwaza, whereas most occurrences of -wa- suggest that it expresses
indefiniteness of the subject. The contrast between following examples shows
that a plural subject reading is out of the question:(1132)   aky-'hͿ    e'mã-cwa-ta    'dai-cwa-ki ('manga)
         two-NOM more-IS-CSO take-IS-DEC mango

         two-NOM more-IS-CSO RED-take-IS-DEC              mango
         ‘a number of people took three (mangoes)’The contrast between (1132) and the next example rather confirms that indefi-
niteness is involved:(1134)   aky-'hͿ      e'mã-tja   'dai-kizjwõ 'manga
         two-NOM more-CSO take-DEC João mango
         ‘João took three mangoes’    Only few examples were encountered which appear to go against the indefi-
nite analysis of -wa-:(1135)   zjwãu     'kwİ-wa-ki
         João      enter-IS-DEC
         ‘João entered here’It is not so likely that this example has a similar pragmatic context as (1129).
    The following example is from a story about a tapir which transforms itself
into a human being. When the transformed man was shot dead, he turned back
into a tapir:(1136)   ã'rǊi a're-wa-hͿ
         tapir turn-IS-NOM
         ‘the transformed tapir’ (t)Here there is no doubt about the definiteness and singularity of the tapir, but
maybe there is an explanation in the fact that the transformation happened
automatically, and that the tapir is not a subject here any more.
   In combination with the imperative mood, -wa- may have a kind of vocative
function:(1137)   tso'roi-wa-ra
         run-IS-IMP
         ‘run, everybody!’
264    5. The verb phraseThe fact that -wa- does not only have its normal indefinite function here is con-
firmed by the fact that it can be succeeded by another subject marking element
-xa-:158(1138)    towa-'nã-tse      tso'roi-wa-xa-ra=tja 'ta-ja-hͿ=wara
          fall-FUT-DEC run-IS-AS-IMP=CSO talk-IO-NOM=but
          ‘“it’s going to fall, people, run!”, he warned them, but ...’ (t)    On some occasions -wa- was explicitly indicated by the consultant to have
an evidential function. For the following example MA deliberately described a
context of the speaker arriving in a room where (either one or many) people are
in the presence of an empty coffee pot and that that is the reason to draw the
conclusion that those people must have drunk all the coffee:(1139)    ka'wİ    kui='bwa-(c)wa-ki
          coffee drink=end-IS-DEC
          ‘(apparently) they finished the coffee’In this case the evidence is indirect, and it is possible that the evidential analy-
sis of -wa- matches with the (unfortunately often poorly registered) contexts of
many (elicited) examples in the present section. However, the fact that the oc-
currence of this morpheme was claimed to rule out the presence of overt argu-
ments in most cases, such as in (1112) and (1113), goes against this analysis
(but note that (1135) is a telling exception in this respect). Furthermore there
seem to be elicited examples of -wa- occurring in eyewitness contexts, e.g. in
(1103) above and in (3510) in (8.3.1.5.). Also, there are many cases of -wa- oc-
curring in eyewitness accounts in the initiation story by ME (part II, text 3.1.).
On the other hand, MA complained about the latter story that ME talked about
her experiences in a way as if she had not participated herself. Furthermore, the
problem remains that the isolated utterances and their contexts were all elicited
in relatively uncontrolled settings, and it cannot be excluded that the consult-
ant’s interpretation of the imagined situation was completely the opposite. As
more textual research is needed here I consider indirect evidentiality for the
time being as a side effect of the basic indefinite function of -wa-.
    The indefinite subject marker -wa- has several allomorphs. The allomorph
-cwa- occurs often as an optional variant of -wa- in cosubordinating construc-
tions discussed in (8.3.1.5.), when following the negative morpheme -he-
(7.1.1.), and probably when following the future morpheme -nã-:(1140)    kui-nã-cwa-ki              (*kui'nãwaki)
          drink-FUT-IS-DEC
          ‘they’re going to drink, there’s going to be drinking’158.In this example, -xa- was glossed as an associated third person marker, but there is
    no way to establish here whether it is not rather a second person subject marker.
                                                      5.1. Person cross-reference    265The allomorph is obligatory in constructions which involve double sets of in-
flexion marking such as quoted speech (5.5.11.), purposive (5.5.12.) and con-
jectural (5.5.14.) constructions. In the remote past (5.5.4.) and habitual (5.5.26.)
constructions, the allomorph -cwa- is usually reduplicated and has the forms
-cu-, -ci- or -ti- ([tu] ~ [tÓ] ~ [ti] ~ [ti]). This is further illustrated by several ex-
amples in the relevant sections, but note also (1130) and (1131) above. The in-
definite different subject morpheme -dwa- is probably related to -wa-. It occurs
only in cosubordinated clauses and indicates that the subject is different from
the indefinite subject of the next clause. This is dealt with in (8.3.2.2.).
   Note that the third person declarative marker -tse is never encountered in
combination with -wa- or its allomorphs.
   Note also that neither -wa- nor its allomorphs seem to cross-refer to inani-
mate subjects.
   The form -wa- has a reflex [swa] in the first and second person object mor-
phemes -taxwa- and -xuxwa-. Some of the properties of indefinite cross-
reference demonstrated above will be illustrated more extensively under
-xuxwa- and -taxwa- below, and under -ja- in (5.1.4.2.).taxwa ‘IS.1O’. In the indefinite subject- first person object morpheme -taxwa-,
the first person object marker -ta- is clearly identifiable. The remaining element
-xwa- strongly resembles the indefinite subject marker -wa-. The relation be-
tween -xwa- and -wa- cannot be explained by morphophonemic rules. Most
likely -xwa- is lexicalised in both -taxwa- ‘(IS.1O)’ and -xuxwa- ‘(IS.2O)’.
    The following examples show this morpheme involved in cross-reference to
indefinite subject combined with a first person object (which consequently is
definite).(1141)    wa'dy-taxwa-ki                          (1142)     ka'hİ-taxwa-ki

          ‘they/he (someone) gave to me’                     ‘they bit me’About the intended subject(s) in example (1142) the consultant said “you can’t
say their names”. Also, it is not possible to inquire about the identity of the in-
definite subject:(1143)    di'lİ ka'hİ-ta-re            (*dilİ ka'hİtaxware)
          who bite-1O-INT
          ‘who bit me?’This is also illustrated for other persons and for -wa- in (4.7.4.).
   The next examples show the occurrence of -taxwa- in various constructions.
In every one of them, it has the same sense.

         (lit. ‘it’s he who took my money, that’s it!’)xuxwa ‘IS.2O’. In the indefinite subject- second person object morpheme
-xuxwa-, the apparent second person element -xu- does not strongly resemble
the second person subject morpheme -xa-. One consultant (TE) says [tsiswa].
The constituent elements of -xuxwa- cannot function as separate morphemes
for themselves: wadyxuxwaki ‘someone/they gave to you’ vs. *wadyxuki,
*wadyxwaki.
     According to MA -xuxwa- is an alternative to -hata-. Clearly, the indefinite
subject is felt as an (indefinite) third person subject. As with -wa- and -taxwa-,
it is not possible to specify or inquire about the subject:(1149)   ka'hİ-xuxwa-ki      (1150)    di'lİ ka'hİ-hata-re (*ka'hİxuxware)

curs normally as a fixed part of -xuxwa- and -taxwa-. Among the rare instances
of its “independent” use we find it in example (1071). It is not clear whether
indefinite subject -(x)wa- is etymologically related to the (homophonous) clas-
sifier -xwa- ‘man’.eteja-wa ‘1PO-IS’ and etelexwa-wa ‘2PO-IS’ are morpheme combinations in
which the indefinite subject morpheme -wa- is productively applied to the cor-
responding first person plural and second person plural definite object mor-
phemes -eteja- and -etelexwa-. No distinction is made between inclusive and
exclusive first person object.(1161)   'mİ̘-eteja-wa-ki                    (1162)    ka'hİ-etelexwa-wa-ki

as only the semantic content of the predicate is of interest.(1163)   mƭu       darje-'dy-ja-ki

-ja-. Note, however, example (1198) below and the following one:(1177)    wady-'ja-tse
          give-IO-DEC
          ‘he gave to him’   On the verb roots ta- ‘to talk’ and İhİta- ‘to tell’, -ja- may have an evasive
function. It is used evasively when it refers to one’s living close relatives, espe-
cially children, grandchildren or newly born babies:(1178)    'hoBinson 'ta-ja-da-ki
          Robinson talk-IO-1S-DEC
          ‘I call him Robinson’It may even have a lamentative interpretation, and it is often used to refer to
deceased persons, which may not necessarily be relatives:(1179)    'si-dy-hͿ     a'ha     'ta-ja-da-ki
          I-POS-NOM father       talk-IO-1S-DEC
          ‘(the late one who) I call my father’(1180)    İhİ'ta-ja-da-ki
          tell-IO-1S-DEC
          ‘I warned the poor fellow’
270   5. The verb phrase   It is not clear whether -ja- can also refer to inanimate indefinite objects.
Possibly it cannot:(1181)    ã'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki     ãwͿi-'ja-xa-xay-'hͿ
          see-1S-NOM-DEC see-IO-2-2-NOM
          ‘I saw that photo you took of them’(1182)    ã'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki      ã'wͿi-xa-xay-hͿ
          see-1S-NOM-DEC see-2-2-NOM
          ‘I saw that photo you took (of house, dog, waterfall etc.)’  Usually, no other morphemes intervene between object and subject markers.
Only two positive exceptions were attested:159(1183)    'krİBa-na oitsi-ja-'nã-xa-re
          Gleba-LOC copulate-IO-FUT-2-INT
          ‘are you going to get laid in Gleba?’In section (7.1.), the relative position of the negation morpheme is discussed.
The negative morpheme canonically precedes the cross-reference markers:(1184)    kahİ-'he-ja-ki
          bite-NEG-IO-DEC
          ‘it (e.g. grasshopper) does not bite’In case of negation of a presupposition, however, the negative morpheme fol-
lows cross-reference marking:(1185)    axehͿ-ja-'he-damͿ-cehere (jã-ki)
          find-IO-NEG-want-APPR          be-DEC
          ‘I think that she is going to encounter no-one (EMPH)’(1186)    we-'tja-he-ky        ka'hİ-ja-he-ki
          fear-TRA-NEG-IMP bite-IO-NEG-DEC
          ‘don’t be afraid, it does not bite (anyone)’   Normally, double object marking within a single verb is not accepted:(1187)    *wai-ja-ta-ki
          good-IO-1O-DEC
          ‘it does good to me’159.Also in example (1053) a future morpheme follows the object morpheme.
                                                 5.1. Person cross-reference   271It appears that -ja-, although being an object marker itself, can occur together
with another, definite object marker in one word:(1188)   axehͿ-ja-'he-eteja-ki
         find-IO-NEG-1PO-DEC
         ‘he did not meet us’Note that both object markers are separated by a negative morpheme and that
-ja- precedes it. This can be seen as a case of recursive derivation, and it may
indicate that -ja- is derived on a deeper level than the subsequent elements. A
likely interpretation would be ‘he met no-one of us’ or ‘he did not meet anyone
with respect to us’. This also suggests that -ja- is not a constituing part of
-İteja-. Maybe -ja- is lexicalised with the verb root as axehͿja- ‘meet’.
    The indefinite object morpheme has clearly a plural connotation in the fol-
lowing example:(1189)   e'tay-nahere-wã wa'dy-ja-ra
         woman-COL-AO give-IO-IMP
         ‘give (it) to all women!’   It is not clear whether the second occurrence of -ja- in the third phrase be-
low represents a second instance of indefinite object marking:(1190)   wady-'ja-da-ki          ‘I gave to them’
         wady-'ja-du'hͿ-da-ki    ‘I gave all to them’
         wady-'ja-duhͿ-'ja-da-ki ‘I gave all to them all’    Even though the following example involves a definite subject, -ja- is ap-
plied. It is probably lexicalised with the root asa- ‘to leave’ as a euphemism:(1191)   asa-'ja-da-ki
         leave-IO-1S-DEC
         ‘I buried him’    Some verbs contain a root-final element -ja-, which may originate from the
indefinite object morpheme, but which is completely lexicalised. Semantically
it does not refer to an indefinite object. As an example xareja- ‘search things’
does take overt definite objects: ui xare'jadaki ‘I’m looking for the tobacco’. In
order to refer to an indefinite object the addition of -ja- is required:(1192)   xareja-'ja-da-ki        (1193)       waja-'ja-he-tsy-tse
         search-IO-1S-DEC                     bring-IO-NEG-POT-DEC
         ‘I’m searching (many) people’        ‘he is not going to bring anyone’
272   5. The verb phrase5.1.4.3. Extension to inclusive object referenceSome translations provided by the consultant suggest that, in the proper con-
text, a first person object can be “understood” and be expressed by the indefi-
nite object morpheme -ja-:(1194)   'a-ty-ja-ki               (1195)    o'tsi-ja-ki
         exist-DET-IO-DEC                    fall-IO-DEC
         ‘there was for us’                  ‘it fell on top of us’(1196)   axe'hͿ-ja-ki
         find-IO-DEC
         ‘he met (us)’ (accidentally on the road)In fact, the example (1196) was presented in a first person inclusive context,
whereas contrasted with a first person exclusive context the consultant offered
the following Kwaza equivalent:(1197)   axe'hͿ-e'teja-ki
         find-1PO-DEC
         ‘he met (us)’ (accidentally on the road)These examples represent the only attested pair in which a contrast between in-
clusive and exclusive first person interpretations of object cross-reference
markers can be suspected. Now remember from example (1177) above that,
against expectations, the indefinite object marker -ja- can be followed by the
special declarative marker -tse. So, when inquiring about a truly indefinite ob-
ject equivalent of (1196) the following sentence was offered:(1198)   axehͿ-'ja-tse
         find-IO-DEC
         ‘he met them’As a consequence, two apparent anomalies with respect to the expected be-
haviour of object cross-reference; an inclusive reading (of -ja-) and a combina-
tion (of -ja-) with the morpheme -tse, may be related in that they work together
to enable both the expression of an inclusive object and of a true indefinite ob-
ject. In view of the fact that these are the only clear examples encountered, it
may not be the case that the distinctions discussed here are fully grammati-
calised. Example (1094) above forms evidence for the fact that -eteja- may
cross-refer to an inclusive pronoun. Furthermore, the verb axehͿ- ‘find’ may be
ideosyncratic. Nevertheless, about the following examples it was said that they
have the same meaning, but that the second alternative was “better”:
                                                      5.1. Person cross-reference   273(1199)    'mİ̘-ja-wa-ki                 (1200)     mİ̘-'eteja-wa-ki
          hit-IO-IS-DEC                            hit-1PO-IS-DEC
          ‘they hit us’                            ‘they hit us’In case the first alternative involves an inclusive first person object, it may have
been considered as less felicitous because it is less easy to imagine a proper
pragmatic context for uttering it.","[297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311]"
"
7.1.1.3. Negation under nominalisationThe canonical negative occurs also in nominalised verbs, without serious con-
sequences for its meaning:(2786)     Ǌcenãi-'he-xa-xa-hͿ     ere'we-da-ki
           know-NEG-2-AS-NOM       write-1S-DEC
           ‘what you (PL) don’t know I’m writing’(2787)     'kopu     kãu-'he-tsy-hͿ           a'wͿi-da-ki
           cup       break-NEG-GER-NOM        see-1S-DEC
           ‘I saw the cup which did not break’299   The countersupposition construction, however, is not so predictable when
nominalised. Compare the following non-nominalised examples, the difference
between which is difficult to establish since they were elicited out of context:(2788)     kui-'he-(c)wa-ki                      (2789)     'kui-wa-he-ki
           drink-NEG-IS-DEC                                 drink-IS-NEG-DEC
           ‘he did not drink’                               ‘he is not drinking’The fact that example (2788) does not involve countersupposition, is suggested
by its nominalised equivalent:(2790)     kui-'he-cwa-hͿ
           drink-NEG-IS-NOM
           ‘that (stuff) which he didn’t drink’However, the “nominalised” version of (2789) is neither analysed formally nor
semantically as a negative construction (nor as a nominalised construction, for
that matter):(2791)     'kui-wa-hehͿ
           drink-IS-CONT
           ‘he is drinking!’299.Elicited translation of: ‘I saw that the cup did not break’.
526   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresNevertheless, (2791) does involve the counter of presupposition. It would be a
proper reply to, for instance, an unjustified remark that the subject be at work.
This construction represents the origin of the contrastive suffix -hehͿ. This suf-
fix, which is further discussed in (5.5.29.), is regarded as a fixed combination.
There is a related construction, however, in which the negative morpheme
seems to be still productive. In this construction, the original nominaliser is re-
placed by a classifier:(2792)    eto'hoi-da-he-xwa
          child-1S-NEG-CL:man
          ‘I (who) am not a child!’300Note that (2792) represents a very marginal construction (see also 4.4.9.), but it
is significant here, since it contains the morpheme order person-negation-
nominalisation and it counters a presupposition.
   There is an alternative, more productive nominalised construction which
expresses countersupposition. Here the morphemic order is person-
nominalisation-negation:(2793)    na='ay-xuko-Ϳ-hͿ-da-hͿ-he-ki
          PROX=that-SETT-ATT-NOM-1S-NOM-NEG-DEC          kǊrǊi-to'hoi-da-le-hͿ

          ‘I am not from here. I was a Kanoê child’301 (t)(2794)    txi'?a    y'nͿ-wa-hͿ         pİ̘rİ̘'jã-wa-hͿ-he-ki
          Txi?a     called.be-IS-NOM speak-IS-NOM-NEG-DEC
          ‘the one who is called Txi?a does not speak (Kanoê)’ (t)(2795)    'kopu       'kãu-hͿ       a'wͿi-da-hͿ-he-ki
          cup         break-NOM see-1S-NOM-NEG-DEC
          ‘it is not the case that I saw the broken cup’302These examples could in principle be explained on grounds that they are first
nominalised and then zero-verbalised and negated. However, they do involve
countersupposition, so the rule seems to be that the place of the nominaliser is
less important than the fact that the negative morpheme follows person mark-
ing. The function of the nominaliser here is mainly to create a cleft construc-
tion.","[563, 564]"
"
7.1.   NegationNegation is expressed principally by a verbal suffix -he-. Its use and the differ-
ent positions it can take inside the word will be discussed in section (7.1.1.). In
addition to the negation suffix, an emphatic marker with a negative effect has
been identified. It may be related to the adverb ƭ ‘idly’ and it is discussed in
(7.1.2.). Finally, the negative habitual morpheme -hͿsi, which replaces the
verb’s mood marker, is dealt with in (7.1.3.).
   Besides these negative elements there are three specific prohibitive moods.
These are not treated here extensively, but in the chapter on mood, in sections
(5.2.7-10.).",[557]

9.1.   Children’s languageThere is a lexical register of children’s talk in Kwaza. It is also used by adults
as child-directed speech to children until about three years of age. I have found
a mere dozen such words, predominantly verbs. Only few of them show any
resemblance to adult words, but they occur in the same grammatical construc-
tions as adult words do. They are listed here, together with their adult equiva-
lents:   CHILDREN’S TALK             MEANING                       ADULT   ñǊñǊ-                       suckle                        kunǊ-

   wãwã                        Westerner                     mãrİ̘?aThere is a phonetic likeness between ñǊñǊ- and adult kunǊ- ‘to suckle’, be-
tween tİtİ- ‘to walk’ and adult cucu- ‘to be stepping’, and maybe between u?u-
‘to sleep’ and adult Ǌi- ‘to lie down’. No likely origin was found- either in
Kwaza or, so far, in neighbouring languages- for the other words. One of the
words wãwã ‘Westerner’ is a noun. The adult equivalent mãrİ̘?a means origi-
nally ‘spirit’, but it was not attested whether this sense applies to wãwã. It is
417.This word was formed by myself on the basis of the verb stem kahİ- ‘to bite’.
716    9. Lexico-semantic categoriesunclear to which category the word txu'bitxu'bi ‘animal that bites (e.g. a spider,
snake, etc.)’ belongs. It may be a noun. The word txœ- ‘fall in water’ is proba-
bly based on onomatopoeia. Here are some examples of child-directed use of
this register:(3754)    ñǊñǊ-'ra                         (3755)   'pu-xa-tsi

          ‘suckle!’                                 ‘take care not to fall!’(3756)    txi'wi-a-ni                      (3757)   wãwã-dy-'hͿ-ki

          ‘let’s take a bath!’                      ‘it is the Westerner’s’
9.2.   Colour termsThere are several colour terms. They are based on semantically attributive ver-
bal roots, and are often derived as attributive nouns (cf. 4.3.2.). Some of the
roots occur obligatorily with the attributive morpheme -Ϳ-. Some roots may oc-
cur without the attributive morpheme with a different, though related, meaning.
One of the roots, darahͿ- ‘green’ does not occur without a classifier. They are
listed here:   'be.?Ϳ-         ‘(very) black’             'be-       ‘ripe, purple’
   dara'hͿ-        ‘green, unripe’            *dara-
   'ha.?Ϳ-         ‘white’                    'ha-       ‘clean’
   ha'nǊ.?Ϳ-       ‘brown, grey’              ha'nõ-     ‘painted grey’
   ha'xy?Ϳ-        ‘yellow, sick’             *haxy-
   ho'ho.?Ϳ-       ‘black’                    ho'ho-     ‘dirty, black’
   'ki.?Ϳ-         ‘red, orange’              'ki-       ‘ripe’
   mİ̘'rǊi?Ϳ-      ‘blue, green’              *mİ̘rǊi-
   'weu?Ϳ-         ‘brown, red’               *weu-Most of the roots without -Ϳ- are semantically related to the corresponding col-
our term. In this way ‘black, dark blue’ and ‘dirty’ are associated via the root
element hoho-, ‘white’ and ‘clean’ via ha-, ‘red’ and ‘ripe’ via ki-. The root
element be- associates ‘deep black (dark?)’ with ‘ripe’ and ‘purple’.
    It seems that hoho?Ϳ- represents another sort of black than be?Ϳ- does.
These roots both have equivalents in Kanoê where the associations are partially
reversed: the negation of Kanoê bİ- or pİ- ‘clean’ relates to the concepts ‘black,
red, dirty, ripe’, whereas Kanoê woro- seems to mean only ‘black’. Together
with ki- the entire situation can be sketched as in table (35) below. The seman-
tic areas covered by a specific root are shaded by <ŵ>:
                                                               9.2. Colour terms   717Table 35. Association range of colour terms for ‘red’ and ‘black’ in Kwaza and Kanoê

related to the Kwaza verb root ho- ‘rot’, and/or to Tupi ho or hǊ ‘black, rotten’.
    The general root for ‘ripe’ and ‘red’ in Kwaza is ki-, but not only things
which ripen can be called ‘red’: kuronitİ ki?ͿhͿ ‘red door’. Furthermore, ki-
also covers the colour ‘orange’. The root be- generally means ‘black’. In the
sense of ‘ripe’ be- only refers to the ripeness of certain fruits with a hard shell,
and in the sense of ‘red’ it only refers to a specific dark shade of red: ‘purple’.
Another term for ‘red’ is weu?Ϳ-. However, its general meaning is ‘brown’.
Another term for ‘brown’ is hanǊ?Ϳ-. The difference between the two has not
been established. At any rate, the consultants say that “much of what is red in
Portuguese, is not red in Kwaza”, by which they imply that the word weu?Ϳ-
‘brown’ is used rather than ki- ‘red’ for shades of colour which would be classi-
fied as ‘red’ in Portuguese. Apparently, weu?Ϳ- refers to an intermediary shade
of colour between ki- ‘red’ and hanǊ?Ϳ- ‘brown’.
    The word mİ̘'rǊi?Ϳ- means both ‘blue’ and ‘green’. The colour of the sky
can be referred to as mİ̘rǊi?Ϳ-, but shades of green can also be referred to by
this word. In Aikanã, the situation is the same: Aikanã hürürü- is the root for
both ‘blue’ and ‘green’. On another occasion, Kwaza mİ̘rǊi?Ϳ- was used only
for ‘blue’ while the word given for green was darahͿ-. However, darahͿ- may
not really be a colour term. The root darahͿ- usually referred to the colour (or
the state?) of unripe fruit. Note that there are words that are possibly derived
from ‘unripe/green’: darato'hoi ‘baby’ (lit. ‘little young one’); da'rai ‘vermin,
worm’. Note that the meaning ‘unripe’ can also be expressed by a negative
form of ki- ‘ripe’:(3758)    ki-'he-tse
          ripe-NEG-DEC
          ‘it is not ripe’   The word for ‘brown’, ha'nǊ?Ϳ- is used by some speakers also for ‘grey’
and even ‘light blue’.418 Note its use for ‘grey’ in the following example:
418.Its variant hanõ?Ϳ- was attested only with the meaning ‘grey’.

5.5.4.1. Nominal properties of the remote past constructionIn the remote past construction, the nominaliser -hͿ- creates a sort of cleft con-
struction with the sense of ‘it is a fact that’. Most examples can be translated as
such literally:(1981)     ca'ri-da-day-hͿ-ki
           shoot-1S-1S-NOM-DEC
           ‘I killed (him)’ (a month ago) (lit. ‘it is a fact that I killed him’)The evidence that the morpheme -hͿ- in the remote past construction is a
nominaliser (see 5.6.) is strong. When the mood suffix is omitted, the result is a
noun:238(1982)     aruxyni'te awͿi-'ja-da-day-hͿ
           photo         see-IO-1S-1S-NOM
           ‘the photo I took of someone’(1983)     awͿi-ta-tay-'hͿ     hãte-ta-'hͿ-xa-hͿ-re        maga'riDa-wã
           see-1O-1O-NOM try-TRA-NOM-2-NOM-INT Margarida-AO
           ‘did you show (lit. ‘try’) the photo (taken) of me to Margarida?’Note that, in such nominals, -hͿ- can even be replaced by specific classifiers
and adverbial and other nominalisers:(1984)     a-da-'day-xy-na               a-'e-damͿ-da-ki
           exist-1S-1S-CL:house-LOC exist-again-want-1S-DEC
           ‘I’m going to live again in the house where I used to live’(1985)     kukui'hͿ-da-day-'wy              (1986)     mƭu        'kui-da-day-'nãi
           ill-1S-1S-time                              chicha drink-1S-1S-NOM
           ‘the time I was ill’                        ‘the fact that I drank chicha’
                                                       (e.g. as an object of ‘to tell’)
(1987)     mƭu        'kui-cu-cwa-'nãi
           chicha drink-IS-IS-NOM
           ‘the fact that they drank chicha’ (long ago)238.Note that (1982) is a nominal modification construction in which juxtaposition of
    nouns has an attributive function. In (1983), the head, aruxynite, is omitted. Note
    furthermore that the verb root hãte- ‘to try’ is also used to express the notion of ‘to
    show’.

         ‘at the time they already existed’ (t)(1990)   tsywydy'te a-a-ay-'nãi
         girl         exist-1P-1P-NOM
         ‘at the time we were girls’ (long ago)Also the deictic element -xuko (allomorph -xukwo) ‘within the settlement’ has
nominalising properties (see 4.6.3.). In the following example, it is zero-
verbalised:(1991)   xyi-ra'ta    a-xa-'xay-xukwo-ki
         you-first    exist-2-2-SETT-DEC
         ‘you are the first inhabitant(s) here’
5.5.5. Future -nã-Future is expressed morphologically in three different ways. Future tense is ex-
pressed by the suffix -nã-. The potential suffix -tsy- and the volitive mood
marker -mͿ represent modal categories which have a temporal connotation.
They will be compared to future tense in (5.5.5.1.).
    Canonical future tense is marked on the verb by the suffix -nã-, which usu-
ally attracts stress. Note the following examples:(1992)   'kui-da-ki                    (1993)     kui-'nã-da-ki
         drink-1S-DEC                             drink-FUT-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m drinking / I drank’                 ‘I’m going / I want to drink’The latter example also illustrates the fact that -nã- can be used with the sense
of ‘to want’.
    Future -nã- does not occur as immediately adjacent to the declarative mood
morpheme -ki. Instead it is followed by -tse in the declarative:(1994)   txa'hͿ ba-jã'hͿ-ki            (1995)     txa'hͿ ba-jãhͿ-'nã-tse
         path       cut-CL:path-DEC               path      cut-CL:path-FUT-DEC
         ‘he is clearing the road’                ‘he will clear the road’
         (TMA:6)                                  (TMA:27; tomorrow)
398    5. The verb phraseHowever, when overt person cross-reference marking intervenes, the -ki de-
clarative is required:(1996)    txa'hͿ ba-'nã-da-ki
          path     cut-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m going to clear the road’ (TMA:22; right now)This distributional restriction of -nã- is discussed in (5.2.1.1.). Future -nã- is
easily distinguishable from the nearly239 homophonous impersonal cross-
reference -na- since the latter does not attract stress, and requires immediate
adjacency to declarative -ki (see 5.1.5.).
   The future morpheme occurs in a position before the argument cross-
reference markers.(1997)    jady-'nã-ta-ki
          feed-FUT-1O-DEC
          ‘he is going to give me food’It may be combined with all cross-reference morphemes, except for non-third
person subject- second person object -nƭnã- ‘(2O)’. Instead, a specific second
person object future cross-reference morpheme -leja- ‘(2O.FUT)’ is used:(1998)    ba'baice-e'te-leja-da-ki
          dance-COMIT-2O.FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I want to dance with you’This morpheme was discussed extensively in (5.1.6.). Future marking with
non-second person object marking involves canonical -nã-:(1999)    ba'baice-e'te-nã-da-ki
          dance-COMIT-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I want to dance with her’    Several examples in section (7.1.1.) on negation suggest that the negative
morpheme -he- usually precedes the future morpheme, and attracts the word’s
main stress. In the following example the future morpheme bears the main
stress:(2000)    awe-he-'nã-tse
          rain-NEG-FUT-DEC
          ‘it is not going to rain’
239.Phonemically, impersonal /na/ is not considered as nasalised, but phonetically it is
    often nasalised: [nã].
                                             5.5. Tense, modality and aspect   399See (2009) for an example of a future morpheme preceding a negative mor-
pheme.
   The future morpheme also occurs with other moods than the declarative:(2001)   kui-he-'nã-tsy-'re
         drink-NEG-FUT-POT-DEC
         ‘isn’t he going to drink?’(2002)   tokoi'ri-a-ki     ka'wİ     kui-'nã-a-ni
         be.tired-1P-DEC coffee drink-FUT-1P-EXH
         ‘we’re tired, let’s drink coffee!’   The future indicated by -nã- can be immediate as well as more remote. Ex-
ample (1995) was elicited in a context of “tomorrow”, whereas example (1996)
belonged in a context of “right now”. In the next example, -nã- refers to imme-
diate future:(2003)   txarwa-te'te    kui-'nã-da-ki
         first-INTENS    drink-FUT-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m going to drink right now’   Future morphemes may occur in cosubordinated sentences with a purposive
sense:(2004)   Ǌcenãi-'nã-tja ere'we-xy-ki
         know-FUT-CSO write-CL:leaf-DEC
         ‘he is writing in order to learn’As demonstrated in (8.3.1.7.), the purposivity of such clauses does not depend
on the future morpheme. Furthermore, the presence of the future morpheme
does not guarantee a purposive sense:(2005)   awe-'nã-tja       kyry'ja-ki
         rain-FUT-CSO thunder-DEC
         ‘it is going to rain and thunder’
5.5.5.1. Overlap between modal categories and future tenseThe volitive mood is marked by the suffix -mͿ. It differs from future -nã- in
that it only occurs with first person subjects and, as discussed in (5.2.5.) and
(5.2.5.1.), that it cannot be applied to non-controlled verbs. In the domain of
overlap between the two categories, there seems to be no difference in mean-
ing:
400   5. The verb phrase(2006)   ja-'nã-da-ki                      (2007)       ja-da-'mͿ
         eat-FUT-1S-DEC                                 eat-1S-VOL
         ‘I’m going to eat’                             ‘I’m going to eat’Predicates in the volitive mood -mͿ cannot bear the future morpheme -nã-:(2008)   tsi'tsİ  wa'ja-a-xa-mͿ    (*tsitsİ wajanã?axamͿ)
         we.EX bring-1P-AS-VOL
         ‘we’re going to take it!’However, the volitional suffix -damͿ- ‘to want’ (which is etymologically re-
lated to the volitive mood, see 5.2.5.1. and 5.5.8.), can be combined with -nã-:(2009)   İ-nã-'he-damͿ-da-ki
         go-FUT-NEG-want-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m not going!’ (I don’t want to)   Furthermore, there is a modal suffix -tsy-, which is discussed in (8.1.1.). It
functions as a potential marker and it refers to a possible future which is less
certain to occur than the future indicated by -nã-:(2010)   tãlo-'nã-tse         / tãlo-da'mͿ-tse
         angry-FUT-DEC        / angry-want-DEC
         ‘(the dog) is getting angry’(2011)   tã'lo-tsy-tse
         angry-POT-DEC
         ‘(don’t tease the dog or) it will get angry’As several examples in (8.1.1.) show, predicates which contain a potential suf-
fix may bear the future morpheme. However, it is not certain that -tsy- in ex-
ample (2001) is potential rather than gerundial.
    Future tense may also have a modal connotation. Example (1993) above
was mentioned as having two interpretations. The morpheme -nã- could be
read as ‘future’ or as ‘to want’. In the contrast between the following examples,
-tsy- rather than -nã-, seems to function as a tense morpheme:(2012)   kui-'nã-xa-re                     (2013)       'kui-xa-tsy-re
         drink-FUT-2-INT                                drink-2-POT-INT
         ‘do you want to drink?’                        ‘are you going to drink?’On many occasions, predicates containing -nã- were translated with a sense of
‘to want’:
                                               5.5. Tense, modality and aspect   401(2014)    cari-'nã-xuxwa-hͿ-ki
          shoot-FUT-IS.2O-NOM-DEC
          ‘they are wanting to kill you’ (t)In fact, the consultant noted about example (2006) above that if it is uttered in
one’s own house, it means ‘I’m going to eat’ but when it is uttered in someone
else’s house, it means ‘I want to eat’. When one is not invited for dinner, this
utterance is then a request for food, which is not regarded as very nice.
    So the context determines to a large extent how -nã- is to be interpreted. I
have considered its basic function to be a future morpheme.","[434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439]"
"
5.2.8. Negative exhortativeThe negative exhortative is also one of the three prohibitive moods. It involves
the original exhortative mood marker -ni, and the negative morpheme -he-. It
was seldom attested.(1493)    ehͿ-'he-a-ni
          make-NEG-1P-EXH
          ‘let us not do that, we’re not going to do it’    A formally less predictable type of negative exhortative is found in the par-
ticle-like expression nãi?ini ‘don’t do (it)!’, ‘stop!’. It employs the exhortative
mood marker -ni together with the element -i-, which may be related to the ad-
verbial negative particle ƭ ‘nothing’. A nasalised pronunciation of -ini as [!ƭnƭ]
322    5. The verb phrasewas observed, but rejected on my explicit inquiry about it. It is probably quite
lexicalised.(1494)    'nãi-i'ni wara'hͿ-he-ky
          like-NEE touch-NEG-NEI
          ‘don’t do that, don’t touch!’189The verbal root nãi- means ‘to be like that’, ‘to do thus’ and its reduplication
has an emphatic function, which results in the sense of ‘very’ or ‘thanks!’:(1495)    na-nãi-i'ni-xa-re                (1496)    na-nãi-i'ni
          RED-like-NEE-2-INT                         RED-like-NEE
          ‘thanks”, (lit. ‘you                       ‘let (it) be!’, ‘don’t do that!’,
          (will) leave (it) be?’190)                 ‘refrain from (it)!’, ‘stop!’This expression is a negative exhortative as regards form and probable literal
meaning. From a functional point of view it should perhaps rather be viewed as
a negative imperative. Because of the lack of less idiomatic examples in which
the semantic value of a possible productive use of -i-ni could be investigated
more thoroughly, I have decided to discuss it here where it belongs at least
from a formal point of view.191 It should be added that the latter expression
(1496) was given explicitly as an alternative for ehͿ'hetjara ‘don’t do that!’ as
shown in (1371).","[359, 360]"
"
5.1.8. Future second person object cross-referenceThere is one transitive cross-reference morpheme which has a future meaning,
the portmanteau morpheme -leja- ‘(2O.FUT)’. This morpheme replaces the pro-
ductive future morpheme -nã- and the second person object morpheme -nƭnã-.
This is the only cross-reference morpheme of its kind, and there is no para-
digm.(1234)    ui         kurje=wa'dy-nƭnã-da-ki
          tobacco roll=give-2O-1S-DEC

          see-2O.FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I want to look at you/make a photo of you’The future of the third person subject- second person object can both be ex-
pressed analytically, that is, by the morpheme -nã- and synthetically, i.e. as un-
analysable part of -leja-:(1242)    wady-'nã-hata-ki                (1243)    ba'baice-ete-le'ja-tse

          ‘he/they are going to give                ‘He wants to dance with you’
          (something) to you’Note that -leja- resembles -nã- in that it cannot be immediately succeeded by
the declarative marker -ki. When no other morphemes intervene -tse is used.
   With non-second person objects the future is always expressed analytically:(1244)    a'we tsoihͿ-le'ja-tse        (1245)       a'we tsoi'hͿ-nã-ta-ki

          ‘the rain will soak you/him’              ‘the rain will soak me’   It appears that -leja- may also cross-refer to plural objects:(1246)    tsi'tsİ  xyi-'wã wady-le'ja-a-xa-ki

object marking:

it can not be denied that the element -le- does resemble the reciprocal mor-
pheme -lİ- ‘each other’, and -ja- resembles indefinite object -ja-, one connota-
tion of which, as seen in (5.1.4.3.), is first person inclusive object.(1252)   pİ̘rİ̘'jã-tja-da-ta oja'nͿ-da-ki

         speak-TRA-2O.FUT-1S-CSO arrive-1S-DEC
         ‘I came here to talk with you’Some examples even suggest interaction between interpretations of -leja- and
(semantic) categories of indefiniteness and inclusivity of the object. With re-
spect to indefiniteness, the morpheme sometimes appears to generalise over
second and third person of object in example (1244) and:(1255)   do-'hͿ-le'ja-da-ki
         leak-NOM-2O.FUT-1S-DEC
         ‘I am going to pour water over you/him’As far as possible inclusivity of objects is concerned, the morpheme conspicu-
ously disallows an inclusive subject in:(1256)   huhui-le'ja-a-xa-ki        (*hu'hui-le'ja-a-ki)
         kill-2O.FUT-1P-AS-DEC
         ‘we are going to kill you’If there is a relation between the future object and the reciprocal and indefinite
object morphemes, it is probably of an etymological nature, i.e. it is lexicalised
at the most and certainly not fully productive and predictable.
                                                                     5.2. Mood     2835.2.   MoodMood is obligatorily expressed by a verb-final morpheme. Kwaza has four in-
dependent basic moods for the sentential matrix verb: declarative, marked by
-ki or -tse; interrogative, marked by -re; and persuasive and prohibitive. The
persuasive is further divided into three sub-moods, depending on the person in-
volved: imperative, marked by -ra for second persons; exhortative-causative,
marked by -ni for first inclusive and third persons; and volitive, marked by -mͿ
for other first persons. The prohibitive is also divided into three sub-moods:
negative imperative, marked by -ky-; negative exhortative, marked by -(i)ni;
and monitory, marked by -tsi.
    Cosubordinated sentences are not overtly marked for these moods, but they
basically get a verb-final general cosubordinate marker -ta or -si the modal
content of which is often determined by the mood of the matrix verb. Cosubor-
dination is discussed in (8.3.). The “mood” markers of adverbial clauses will be
discussed in (8.2.).
    It is important to note that without any further morphological or lexical op-
erations, the default tense interpretation of the verb root which is inflected for
person and declarative mood is ambiguous between present and anterior to the
moment of speaking:(1257)    o'nİ-ki
          arrive-DEC
          ‘he arrives / he arrived’Although the default interpretation of the interrogative is also potentially both
present and anterior, there is a stronger tendency for it to be present tense.
    In this section, all moods are discussed. Interaction between mood and per-
son marking is discussed where it applies. Some moods other than the declara-
tive require person markers which deviate slightly from the situation sketched
in section (5.1.). They were not dealt with in that section because they are de-
pendent on certain specific moods.
    Eight basic mood marking morphemes were identified in Kwaza. In the pre-
sent section they will be treated in the same order as they appear in the follow-
ing table.172
172.Mood in subordinated verbs is discussed in section (8.2.) on adverbial clauses, and
    mood in cosubordinated verbs in section (8.3.) on medial clauses.

5.2.1. Declarativeki ‘DEC’. The declarative mood marker -ki is the form normally encountered in
(elicited) declarative sentences. It is fully productive with all subject and object
persons. The zero-marked third person form is usually the citation (translation)
form of an isolated verb.(1258)    'mã-Ø-ki
          call-3-DEC
          ‘he/she/it/they call/called’In elicited complex sentences, declarative cosubordinated verb phrases are in
the cosubordinative “mood” (see 8.3.), whereas the last word of the sentence is
usually the matrix verb ending in declarative -ki:(1259)    'e-wa-ta     'hu-wa-ki
          leave-IS-CSO smoke-IS-DEC
          ‘(she) went (home and is) smoking’In running text the declarative is rare. It is often used for directly quoted pas-
sages within a narrative:(1260)    duky'hͿ kuja'?u       kukui'hͿ-da-ki ƭ'wã-tja
          other     Curiangu ill-1S-DEC         nothing-CSO
          ‘another (man called) Curiangu said “I’m ill” but it was a lie’ (t)In running text most “sentences”, including the declarative, are normally in the
cosubordinative mood. Such texts, usually traditional tales, are often finished
by a verbal formula with a declarative mood ending -ki, as if the whole pre-
ceding text was one long complex sentence, symbolically ending with a matrix
verb form:
                                                                    5.2. Mood    285(1261)    duky'hͿ ehͿ-'si  hary'ky eto'hoi            a-'wy         duky'hͿ

    here (is where the story ends), they multiplied again, it is said’ (t)    When eliciting the second person forms in the declarative, usually a context
of joking or irony had to be offered. It was never easy to avoid being given the
pragmatically more usual imperative or interrogative forms.tse ‘DEC’. There is an alternative declarative ending -tse, which is often pro-
nounced as [tsİ]. It is hard to determine what the fundamental difference is
between the declarative in -tse and the declarative in -ki. Sometimes they be-
have as if they are mutually interchangeable:(1262)    'wy-ki        / 'wy-tse           (1263)    'kwİ-ki      /    'kwİ-tse
          wind-DEC         wind-DEC                   enter-DEC         enter-DEC
          ‘(leaves) are rustling (in the wind)’       ‘he entered’Verbs in the -tse declarative are basically equivalent to those in the declarative
in -ki. They are matrix verbs which can take cosubordinate clauses in the co-
subordinative mood:(1264)    mangka-'to     hoi-'tja     tãi-'he-tse
          mango-CL:fruit sweet-CSO tough-NEG-DEC
          ‘the mangoes are sweet and soft’
5.2.1.1. Distributional characteristics of -tse vs. -kiThere are some important morphologically determined systematic differences
in the distribution of -ki and -tse. -ki may occur with all persons and without
any further adaptation of the verb root. -tse can only occur with the zero-
marked third person subject (and object), and cannot be combined with an im-
mediately preceding overt person marker:(1265)    'kwİ-da-ki (*'kwİdatse)           (1266)    'kwİ-wa-ki (*'kwİwatse)
          enter-1S-DEC                                enter-IS-DEC
          ‘I entered’                                 ‘someone entered’
286    5. The verb phraseWhen following overt person markers, including indefinite and impersonal,
other morphemes have to intervene between -tse and the person marker. In the
following example, the potential aspect marker -tsy- occurs between the person
and mood markers:(1267)    'kwİ-da-tsy-tsİ  (*'kwİdatsyki)
          enter-1S-POT-DEC
          ‘I will enter’So -tse can be combined with overt person markers inside one verb, but it is in
principle never adjacent to them.173
   A related morphological condition on the distribution of the declarative
markers is found in the fact that certain morphemes such as the said -tsy- ‘(po-
tential)’, -tara- ‘(procrastinative)’ and -'nã- ‘(future)’ disallow the occurrence
of an immediately subsequent -ki, and require -tse (and see also 5.2.1.5.):(1268)    ja-da-ta'ra-tsİ  (*jadata'raki)
          eat-1S-PROC-DEC
          ‘I’ll eat later’In contrast, there are also derivational morphemes which never precede -tse,
even when there is no overt person marker, such as the attributive -Ϳ-:(1269)    hare'tİ-Ϳ-ki (*haretİ?Ϳtse)
          bald-ATT-DEC
          ‘he is bald’   When overt person marking intervenes between a derivational morpheme
and the declarative, the -ki declarative is required. Note, for example, that fu-
ture -nã-, which only combines with the -tse declarative, is homophonous with
the impersonal cross-reference marker -nã- ‘one’. The consultant once sug-
gested that in order to preserve the distinction between these morphemes dif-
ferent declarative markers are required:(1270)    kui-'nã-tse      (*kui'nãki)        (1271)    'kui-nã-ki (*'kuinãtse)
          drink-FUT-DEC                                 drink-one-DEC
          ‘he is going to drink’                        ‘we are drinking/one drank’(1272)    kui-'nã-da-ki (*kui'nãdatse)
          drink-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I am going to drink’173.The only cross-reference morpheme that does seem to be allowed in a position im-
    mediately adjacent to -tse is the indefinite object morpheme -ja-. This was attested
    twice, in examples (1177) and (1198) in (5.1.4.2-3.).
                                                                 5.2. Mood   287Observe that the placement of stress in the above examples also goes to mark
the distinction. The future morpheme -'nã- attracts stress whereas argument
cross-reference markers do not bear stress. The negative morpheme -he- is an-
other morpheme which attracts stress. When no overt person marking inter-
venes, the usual declarative to be combined with negative -he- is -tse. But when
-he- does occur with -ki, stress placement is different:(1273)   dehemǊte-'he-tse                  (1274)   dehemǊ'te-he-ki
         spirits-NEG-DEC                            spirits-NEG-DEC
         ‘it isn’t spirits’                         ‘it isn’t spirits’Example (1273) represents a canonical negative construction, whereas example
(1274) represents a counter of presupposition. The difference between these
constructions is explained in (7.1.1.).174
   My first conclusion is that the distinction between both declaratives is in
part a strictly formal affair. Some morphemes seem to disallow one specific
subsequent declarative marker, whereas other morphemes require one. Also,
the distinction has a morphophonological expression in differences in stress
placement.","[318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325]"
"
5.5.19.3. Modal interpretations of -tara-So far, the morpheme -tara- was considered as a kind of procrastinative aspect
suffix. However, there are some constructions which may lead to a more modal
interpretation of -tara-.
    When followed by -hͿ, and then verbalised by declarative -ki, the element
-tara- has the sense of ‘to do certainly’. This meaning may be only distantly
related to ‘to do later’ or ‘to do first’:(2256)   atsu'ka nãi-ta-'tara-hͿ-ki
         sugar     like-1O-PROC-NOM-DEC
         ‘(I’m definitely) certain it is sugar (which made me ill)’(2257)   e'tay     nãi-ta-'tara-hͿ-ki
         woman like-1O-PROC-NOM-DEC
         ‘(I’m definitely) certain it is the women (who are calling me)’ (t)Note that -tara- occupies the expected position after object marking. In the pre-
sent construction -tara- may also be applied directly to a noun, which has ap-
parently undergone zero-verbalisation:(2258)   atsu'ka-'tara-hͿ-ki
         sugar-PROC-NOM-DEC
         ‘(I’m definitely) certain it is sugar (and not salt)’  When followed by -hͿ, and then verbalised by cosubordinative -ta, the ele-
ment -tara- has the sense of ‘to have done already’. This meaning seems easily

about how to make chicha, the indigenous beverage. It contains two instances
of -tara-hͿ-ta:(2259)   kayte-'ce-a-ta             'be    ja
         scrape-CL:hole-1P-CSO      leaf   alreadytowİ=txi'te-a-tara-hͿ-ta    kayte-'ce-a-ta                     'hãrã-a-ta

   already broken off and piled up, and we finished cleaning. After having put
   the maize on the fire and cooked it, finishing to clean, now they (the men)
   used to dig, and plant (the mortar)’In the following example, -tara- modifies a habitual construction (see 8.6.1.):(2260)   e'xwa-tjate 'mİ̘-tjarjͿ-dy-ta a-tara-'hͿ-ta
         man-3.POS beat-much-DS-CSO exist-PROC-NOM-CSO         ‘mİ̘-e-dy-ta        emã=hã'rã-tja

         ‘she was already accustomed to her husband always hitting her, when
         he beat again, she just stopped crying’ (t)In the next example, -tara-hͿ-ta is part of a reported speech construction (see
5.5.11.):(2261)   kui-xa-'ki=cwa-tara-hͿ-ta
         drink-2-DEC=IS-PROC-NOM-CSO
         ‘(I did not offer as) they said that you had already drunk’    The construction represented by the subsequent examples is formally identi-
cal to (2259), but it has a different, more modal sense of ‘to do fortunately’:(2262)   'tͅitja    'a-tara-hͿ-ta
         alone      exist-PROC-NOM-CSO
         ‘luckily, he was (there) alone’

            alone      exist-1S-PROC-NOM-CSO
            ‘luckily, I was alone’
5.5.19.3.1. -tjara- as an alternative of -tara-There is a modal construction with the same semantic value of -tara- ‘fortu-
nately’ as in examples (2262) and (2263), but it involves an alternative element
-tjara-. This may force us to look at the element -tara- in a different way. Note
the following examples:(2264)      tei-'hͿ-tjara-hͿ-ta           (*tͅihͿtarahͿta)
            one-NOM-PROC-NOM-CSO

            grandparent-3.POS-only-PROC-NOM-CSO
            ‘how lucky he was that only his grandmother was there’ (t)The following construction is obviously related:(2267)      txa'nã awe-'he-tjara-re (2268)              txa'nã kui-'he-tjara-re
            we.IN    rain-NEG-PROC-INT                  we.IN    drink-NEG-PROC-INT
            ‘good that it did not rain!’                ‘good that he didn’t drink (it)!’This construction represents a partially idiomatic expression, in which the in-
clusive pronoun (see 4.7.2.) and the interrogative mood are used emphatically
(see 5.2.2.1.). Also constructions which are somehow the negative equivalents
of (2252) and (2253) seem to require -tjara- instead of -tara-:259.Note that example (2264) represents a corrected version of the following:            ?*tei-'hͿ-tja-tara-hͿ-ta
            one-NOM-CSO-PROC-NOM-CSO
            ‘luckily there was (only) one’      Even though the verb in this example bears canonical -tara- it is in a strange posi-
      tion, as it follows a clause-final cosubordination marker. This is probably why it was
      rejected later by the consultant.
                                                5.5. Tense, modality and aspect    443(2269)    atsile-'he-tjara-re          (*'atsiletjara're)
          heavy-NEG-PROC-INT
          ‘it isn’t very heavy is it?’(2270)    dehe-'he-tjara-re
          bitter-NEG-PROC-INT
          ‘it isn’t very bitter, is it?’In a way -tjara- in the latter two examples can also be interpreted as semanti-
cally related to ‘fortunately’. It so happens both questions anticipate a reassur-
ing answer. Example (2269) was uttered in the context of someone wanting the
speaker to carry something, but the speaker was in doubt, because the item to
be carried looked rather heavy. Example (2270) was uttered in the context of
someone wanting the speaker to drink medicine. Especially children abhor bit-
ter tastes. Note that the said positive equivalents (2252) and (2253) also have a
modal connotation of ‘fortunately’. Here is one more, elliptic, example:(2271)    'he-tjara-ki
          NEG-PROC-DEC
          ‘it isn’t dirty!’, ‘don’t worry!’, ‘nothing wrong!’, ‘doesn’t matter!’    Instead of the expected -tara-, we find -tjara- in the examples of the present
section. This strongly reminds of the variation between cosubordinative -ta and
-tja as discussed in (8.3.1.4.). This is corroborated by the fact that -tjara- is in-
compatible with non-third person forms. Compare the following example to
(2268):(2272)    txa'nã kui-'he-da-tara-re
          we.IN    drink-NEG-1S-PROC-INT
          ‘good that I did not drink (it)!’ (it was poisoned)So, one could ask whether -tara- is actually discontinuous. Would it not be
better to analyse it as a clause-final cosubordinative -ta, which is then followed
by an unidentified verb ra- of modal content? And, would this have conse-
quences for the analysis of all examples in the present section (5.5.19.)? Under
such an analysis, e.g. (2214) should be analysed as a biclausal construction:(2273)    'ja-da-ta      'ra-tse
          eat-1S-CSO ???-DEC
          ‘I’ll eat later’The fact that ra- bears stress here could be used in support of its interpretation
as a verbal root. However, there are very many instances of ra- without stress,
to begin with (2215). Furthermore, -tara- can be omitted, together with the
sense of ‘to do later’, as if it were an indivisible suffix:
444   5. The verb phrase(2274)   o'kja-a-'xa-(tara)-tsy-hͿ-he're=jã-re          (see 8.1.1.3.)
         hunt-1P-AS-PROC-POT-NOM-APPL=be-INT
         ‘we are still going to hunt! (but we’re too busy now)’Finally, no clearly identifiable verb root of the form ra- was attested. One
could assume the existence of such a root, by analysing ra- as ‘to be’ or ‘to be-
come’. With some imagination, rahͿki in example (2256) can be ascribed the
sense of ‘to be certainly’, ratsytse in (2220) ‘to be potentially’, ramͿ in (2245)
‘I to be’ and so on. But then one would also expect elliptic occurrences of this
construction, in which a context like e.g. the question ‘when are you going to
eat?’ allows for a minimal answer, such as ratse ‘it will be’. However, such el-
liptic answers always include the preceding person marker and -ta-, as in
(2223).
    There is actually one verb root of the form ra-. It is apparently based on the
imperative mood morpheme -ra. It occurs only in combination with a subse-
quent transitiviser -tja- and means ‘to order (him)’:(2275)   ra'tja-ki                 (2276)     İ-'nƭ-da-ta ra'tja-da-ki
         order-DEC                            go-CAUS-1S-CSO order-1S-DEC
         ‘he ordered him’, ‘he’s insisting’   ‘I ordered him to go home’Another form based on imperative -ra is elliptic, and contains a preceding em-
phatic imperative morpheme -ca- (which is also pronounced as [tja]). It func-
tions as a positive minimal answer to an offer or a declaration of intention:(2277)   ca-'ra
         EMP-IMP
         ‘yes! / it is O.K. / do so!’I assume that these imperative constructions have nothing to do with any analy-
sis of the procrastinative -t(j)ara-. They are discussed further in (5.5.11.1.).","[478, 479, 480, 481, 482]"

5.5.11.   QuotationIn Kwaza, no distinction is made between direct and indirect reports. Maybe it
is even better to say that there is no indirect speech at all. Speech is quoted by
literally repeating what has been said. Furthermore, several other types of
“complementation” are also expressed in the form of reported speech.
    The construction is basically monoclausal. It consists of a predicate which
contains two levels of person and mood inflexion. The level which is closest to
the predicate root represents the quoted utterance, and the second level repre-
sents the inflexion of a verb of speech. Main stress is normally on the mood
marker of the level mentioned first, while the last syllable of the predicate root
retains secondary stress. Because no root of a verb of speech is present, the
construction is probably the result of ellipsis (see 5.5.11.1. and 7.5.). The fol-
lowing examples show how the construction works:(2015)    kukui'hͿ-da-'ki-tse

          ‘I said I am ill’                      ‘he says she is ill’These examples show that the verb with the first set of person and mood mark-
ers represents the actual utterance of the quoted person, whereas the second set
of person and mood markers identifies the quoted person and the illocutionary
status of the quoted utterance in the actual discourse context. The structure of
an example like (2018) can be represented as follows:(2020)    [[kukui'hͿ-da-'ki]-da-ki]       (lit. ‘“I am ill” (said) I’)

by pre-inflexional tense, modality or aspect marking:(2027)    'marju kukui'hͿ-da-ki-da'mͿ-tse

in a syntactic habitual construction of the form V-ta a- ‘use to V’. The gerun-
dial element -tsy- is used in the sense of ‘she said’ (see also 8.1.2.2.). Negative
-he- is highly elliptic for ‘he did not do it’.

plex sentence constructions, be they cosubordinated clauses, as in (2030),

    of ‘I came to talk with him’ is not a quotation construction, but a purposive con-
    struction, illustrated in (8.3.1.7.). The present example is also repeated as (3145).

involve verbs of ‘saying’. These constructions do not contain double layers of
person and mood marking. They just consist of juxtapositions of matrix
clauses:(2037)    u'te-ta       kukui'hͿ-xa-'ki 'ta-ta-ki

          ‘Hermes called me over for me to speak with Teteru’
          (lit. ‘Hermes called me, saying to me: “speak with Teteru!”‘)It seems reasonable to assume that the quoted speech construction originates
from this latter juxtapositive sentence construction. One could imagine that the
root of the verb for ‘to say’ is omitted, and that the remaining context depend-
ent person and mood markers are cliticised to the preceding fully inflected
quoted verb.
    Elliptic constructions in which the root of the quoted utterance, or the entire
quoted utterance itself, is omitted occur as well. In the following four exam-
ples, the omitted material is represented by “0”.(2041)    cutİ-da-'mͿ-Ø-tja

          ‘they said to me’Also, when one presents a combination of a person and mood marker in isola-
tion to a native speaker of Kwaza, and one asks what it means, he or she will
suggest several different possible interpretations, among them quoted speech:(2045)    cwa-'si
          IS-SWR
          ‘they did’, ‘it is said’, ‘they say’, ‘well then’, ‘now’ (t)   In (8.3.1.9.) the unlikeliness of the verb root ta- ‘talk’ as originating from a
reinterpreted cosubordinative mood marker -ta is discussed. Note the following
example:(2046)    hou'rje ta
          arrow       talk
          ‘(it is) called “arrow”‘One could hypothesise that this example originates from the following expres-
sion242:(2047)    hou'rje-ta
          arrow-CSO
          ‘it being an arrow’However, (2046) is more likely an elliptic utterance, be it a relatively rare one.
Normally, ta in the sense of ‘talk’ is also marked for person, mood and the like:(2048)    wari'ñǊ ta-'re
          solveira talk-INT
          ‘is it (the tree) called wari'ñǊ?’(2049)    ti-'nãi        kͅ'wͅ ƭkǊ'kǊ 'ta-nãi-re

occasions, and has become part of the transitive verb root tjata- ‘to speak to
someone’. This verb root may have emerged from constructions such as:(2050)   he?ai-xa-'re-tja      'ta-wa-si
         want.not-2-INT-CSO talk-IS-SWR
         ‘“you don’t want?” they said (to him)’ (t)(2051)   kwİ-nİ-he-'ky-tja                  'ta-da-mͿ
         enter-DR:hither-NEG-NEI-CSO talk-1S-VOL
         ‘I’ll tell him not to enter’
         (lit. ‘I’m going to talk, saying: “don’t enter!”‘)Note the difference in perspective with the quotation construction:(2052)   ja-'nã-xa-re-tja        'ta-da-ki
         eat-FUT-2-INT-CSO       talk-1S-DEC
         ‘I asked him whether he was going to eat’
         (lit. ‘“are you going to eat?” I said (to him)’)(2053)   ja-'nã-xa-'re-da-ki
         eat-FUT-2-INT-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m asking you whether you ate’
         (lit. ‘“are you going to eat?” I said (to you)’)    Note that there are no verbs for ‘allowing’ or ‘forbidding’ in Kwaza. Such
senses are expressed through constructions in which imperatives and negative
imperatives are quoted. The verb root ratja- ‘to order’ and the imperative parti-
cle cara (see 5.2.3.4.) are also possible derivations of elliptic quotation con-
structions. Note the following examples:(2054)   ra'tja-ta-ki    wi'lena-na     oja-'ra-tja
         order-1O-DEC Vilhena-LOC go-IMP-CSO

         ‘don’t worry!’, ‘there is nothing wrong!’, ‘it doesn’t matter!’
408   5. The verb phrase5.5.11.2. Other uses of the quotation constructionQuotation may represent mental activity, and the quotation construction does
not always concern literally reported speech. In the following examples, the
first person singular interrogative quoted by a first person singular is shown to
have a dubitative or ruminative function:(2058)   wara'ñͿ-e-da-tsy-'re-da-ki
         work-again-1S-POT-INT-1S-DEC
         ‘I think I’m going to work again’(2059)   warañͿ-te'te-da-tsy-'re-da-ki
         work-INTENS-1S-POT-INT-1S-DEC
         ‘I think I’m really going to work much’(2060)   wara'ñͿ-e-nã-da-'hͿ=wara        ti-nãi-da-tsy-'re-da-ki
         work-again-FUT-1S-NOM=but what-NOM-1S-POT-INT-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m going to work again but I don’t know how to do it’(2061)   he?ai-da-tsy-'re-da-ki
         want.not-1S-POT-INT-1S-DEC
         ‘I think I’m going to say no’   There is a quotation construction in which the quoting person is a first per-
son singular in a preconditional adverbial clause involving -lİ (see 8.2.1.3.1.):(2062)   kude're korİ-'ki=da-lİ            'ja-da-tsy-tse
         Kudere cleave-DEC=1S-PREC eat-1S-POT-DEC
         ‘(only) if Kudere/Canderé harvests (grubs), I will eat”
         (lit. ‘as soon as I’m aware that Kudere harvests, I will eat’)An English equivalent of this construction is probably something in the order
of ‘as far as I am concerned, I will eat if Canderé harvests the grubs’. The pre-
conditional value of the construction in (2062) it probably not very strong.
    In section (5.2.2.1.) various constructions in which the interrogative has an
emphatic function are discussed. One of these constructions seems to have ex-
tra emphasis when presented as quoted by the first person singular. Note the
following examples:(2063)   kukui 'cu=hy=hy-dwa-'re-da-hͿ-ki
         wow step=move=move-DR:onto-INT-1S-NOM-DEC
         ‘my, what a lot of tracks there were on the road!’
                                                  5.5. Tense, modality and aspect    409(2064)    ku'kui ja-'re-da-hͿ-ki
          wow     eat-INT-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘my, what did he eat much!’(2065)    ku'kui ja-xa-'re-da-hͿ-ki
          wow     eat-2-INT-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘my, what did you eat much! / how did you eat!’Literally, (2065) can be interpreted as ‘it is a fact that I said: “wow!, do/did you
eat?”‘. Such an interpretation resembles partially similar emphatic construc-
tions which consist of first person quotations in English, e.g. ‘I say, you know
how to eat!’.243 Apparently, this construction must contain a first person sub-
ject, since otherwise a more literal reading is obtained:(2066)    ku'kui ja-'re-xa-hͿ-ki
          wow       eat-INT-2-NOM-DEC
          ‘you said: “wow, he eats much!”’    The quotation construction is probably also the basis of the purposive con-
struction involving -te- (5.5.12.), the desiderative construction involving -heta-
(5.5.13.), the intentional construction involving -here- (5.5.14.1.) and the con-
struction involving apparential -tehere- (5.5.14.2.).
    Finally, the degrammaticalised occurrence of certain mood markers as mo-
dality morphemes may also derive from quotation constructions.","[440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447]"

                                Introduction
Kwaza is an unclassified indigenous Amazonian language that is spoken by 25
people. The speakers of Kwaza live in the indigenous reserve of Tubarão-
Latundê on the headwaters of the Apediá or Pimenta Bueno river in the South-
east of the federal Brazilian state of Rondônia. In traditional times the Kwaza
must have formed a fierce nation of a few thousand persons subdivided into
various groups. They lived in a huge area, as neighbours of the Aikanã nation
which was of similar size and structure.1 It is not known when exactly the
Kwaza met representatives of Western cultures for the first time.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]"

8.2.2.2. Frustrative and antithetic -le-(hͿ)-There is an “antithetic” or “counterfactual” concessive construction that one
could call the frustrative. It employs the elements -le-(hͿ)- in various ways. The
frustrative element -le- often indicates that a certain situation in the past does
not obtain any more, or that something has “nearly” happened. In combination
with nominaliser -hͿ(-) there can be a connotation of regret. It has not been es-
tablished whether frustrative -le- is related to preconditional -lİ or concessive
-lete.
    The subordinate clause may contain clause-final -le-hͿ while the matrix
verb is in the declarative:

         ruin-FRUST-NOM move-NOM                 good-DEC
         ‘it (the bridge) is ruined, but (still) good to walk’The subordinate clause in the above example is in a way counterfactual because
the bridge does not appear to be totally ruined. Despite of the impression it
might make one can still walk across. The next example shows that neither an-
titheticity nor counterfactuality are strict, formal-semantic requirements of
frustrative subordination:(3397)   ywy'nwͿ      'dy=asa-'nã-da-le-hͿ              'tãi-ki
         tree         cut=leave-FUT-1S-FRUST-NOM hard-DEC
         ‘I was going to cut away the tree trunk, but it was (too) hard’The subordinate clause in the above example is “antithetic” in that the enter-
prise of cutting away the tree trunk did not have the intended result. It was lit-
erally frustrated because of the hardness of the timber. A situation of similar
antithetic calibre holds in the following example:(3398)   jere'xwa wai'hͿ ã'wͿi-da-le-hͿ               'nã-hͿ-ki
         jaguar nice         see-1S-FRUST-NOM         stink-NOM-DEC
         ‘I saw a beautiful dog but it stank’   The antithetic sense can be reinforced by the intentional conjectural -here-
(see 5.5.14.):(3399)   wai-'he-tsy-hͿ-here-da-le-hͿ                 'wai-ki
         good-NEG-GER-NOM-INTL-1S-FRUST-NOM good-DEC
         ‘I thought it was bad, however, it was good’(3400)   ͅrͅ'wͅhͿ-here-da-le-hͿ
         wild-INTL-1S-FRUST-NOM
         ‘I thought it was wild (but it is a domestic cat)’   The entire combination -le-hͿ- may also be part of a matrix verb. Often it
express the fact that some situation existed in the past but not any more in the
present. In this way it functions as an aspect marker of arrested progression
(see 5.5.18.):(3401)   emǊ'hͿ-le-hͿ-'ki

         ‘it was wet’ (CX: it has already dried)

          coffee drink-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘I already drank coffee’(3403)    Ba'hoso-na        'a-da-day-le-'hͿ-ki
          Barroso-LOC exist-1S-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘I used to live in Barroso’ (but I don’t any more)(3404)    da'nͿ    onİ-'he-xa-wy      hyhy'rwa-da-le-hͿ-ki
          still    arrive-NEG-2-time move-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘I walked a while before you arrived’ (but not thereafter)This sense of ‘situation that obtained in the past and was interrupted’ may also
have a connotation of ‘unfortunately’, ‘what a pity’. The subject in the next ex-
ample is unfortunate because the cigarette ended:(3405)    ui       'hu-le-hͿ-ki
          tobacco smoke-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘he was smoking (but the cigarette ended) unfortunately’The next example apparently does not refer to a past situation, but there is an
antithetic implication in the unfortunate dilemma which it expresses:(3406)    haru'wi ja-a-tsy-'tse-tsy-le-hͿ-ki
          Luiz      eat-1P-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘Luiz invited us/me for dinner, now what to do?’Literally this sentence involves a quotative construction meaning ‘unfortu-
nately Luiz said “we are going to eat”‘. The dilemma lies in the fact that the
hearer and his companion had different plans, but they can impossibly decline
his offer. The following examples also contain quotative constructions and an-
tithetic implications:(3407)    hã    mǊi-tsy-'tse-da-le-'hͿ-ki
          water submerge-POT-DEC-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘I was ordering you to fetch water (but you didn’t)’(3408)    hã     mǊi-(xa)-tsy-'tse-tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
          water submerge-2-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘he said I had to get water, but it’s a pity (it’s not possible)’364364.Remember that potential -tsy- has a mitigated imperative connotation here, and that a
    second person is expressed optionally in this construction. Note also that the ‘com-
    mand’ is embedded in a quoted speech construction, which is why the subject of the
    embedded verb is ultimately a first person object on the discourse-pragmatic level.
                                                      8.2. Adverbial clauses   643(3409)   hã    mǊi-tsy-'tse-tsy-le-'hͿ                  bõ'rõ-tse
         water submerge-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM perforate-DEC
         ‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’In example (3409) the antithetic phrase is a subordinated adverbial clause,
whereas in (3408) it is part of the matrix verb. The contrast between examples
(3408) and (3409) (repeated from 1375) suggests that the occurrence of -le-hͿ(-
) inside the matrix clause represents a zero-verbalised noun-phrase rather than
an extension of the verb by a verbalising suffix. In fact, it may corroborate the
hypothesis that subordinate clauses in Kwaza are noun phrases.
    -le-hͿ(-) is an analysable combination of different morphemes. In the first
place, -hͿ may be replaced by a specific classifier (see 4.2.):(3410)   a'xy ͅ'hike    'a-tsy-le-xy
         house Henrique exist-GER-FRUST-CL:house
         ‘the house where Henrique lived’ (t)In the second place, the element -hͿ plays a role in nominalisation, which may
produce relative clause-like phrases (see 8.4.1.1.):(3411)   Ǌcenãi-'he-da-hͿ      ere'we-da-ki
         know-NEG-1S-NOM write-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m writing up what I don’t know’Such a nominalised phrase can be zero-verbalised again by the application of a
mood marker:(3412)   si 'kui-da-hͿ-ki         hã         (*kuihͿdaki)
         I drink-1S-NOM-DEC water
         ‘it is me who drank water’365In comparison with the preceding example the element -le- in the next example
may seem to have a sense of an ongoing action in the past which was inter-
rupted at some point (see 5.5.18.):(3413)   si 'kui-da-le-hͿ-ki           hã
         I drink-1S-FRUST-NOM-DEC water
         ‘it was me who was drinking water’366The contrast between the next examples in which the element -hͿ does not oc-
cur, also suggests that the element -le- has a sense of interrupted continuous
action:365.MA in POR: eu que tomei agua

           ‘why did you give it?’367                   ‘why were you giving it?’368Canonically, the part -le- by itself creates the antithetic sense of ‘nearly’:(3416)     hy'ja-da-le-ki
           fall-1S-FRUST-DEC
           ‘I nearly fell’The sense of ‘nearly’ is semantically related to the notion of ‘frustrative’ be-
cause it refers to the fact that something which was about to happen did not
happen after all, whether this is fortunate or not. Sometimes, a verb ending in
frustrative -le-hͿ can express this notion:(3417)     rai'hͿ-tsy-le-hͿ
           ruin-GER-FRUST-NOM
           ‘it having nearly broke’Sometimes, -le has a ‘frustrative’ connotation by itself:(3418)     hako'ro mãdu'tu-da-le-(hͿ)-ki

           bathe-1P-NOM-FRUST-DEC
           ‘it was for bathing (but now it has broke down)’369In a non-antithetic context -le helps to express ‘pity’ and ‘regret’ (see also
5.5.18.)(3421)     'sopa 'wai-le-ki           'bwa-tse
           soup nice-FRUST-DEC finish-DEC

          shoot=leave-IS-NOM hair=hair-only-ATT-FRUST-pity-DEC
          ‘it is a pity that they killed him with his long hair’370The overall meaning of -le-(hͿ-) is probably that something is not the case even
though it was the case once in the past, or even though it was expected to be the
case. This is the reason why I have discussed -le-(hͿ-) as part of the concessive
category. A verb may contain -le- with this aspect-like meaning, but it can also
be nominalised and then function as a concessive clause. The concessive clause
can be subordinated to a matrix clause, or it can be incorporated in the matrix
clause through zero-derivation.
    Under ellipsis (see 7.5.) of the preceding verb stem or a quoted expression,
-(tsy)-le-hͿ- can occur as a root with context dependent meaning:(3423)    le-'hͿ-ki                          (3424)    tsy-le-'hͿ-ki
          FRUST-NOM-DEC                                GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
          ‘yes’, ‘he wanted to’,                       ‘what a pity’ (as e.g. in the
          ‘he was saying’                              context of (3406/3158))(3425)    xa-le-'re
          2-FRUST-INT
          ‘you would like?’ (t)
8.2.2.3. The concessive element -waraThere is another type of concessive construction that is realised through what
looks like subordination of two clauses by an intervening conjunctional ele-
ment (-)wara, roughly translated as ‘but’. The morphological status of this
element is not entirely clear. On the one hand it behaves like an independent
particle, but on the other hand it is very frequently connected to the nominaliser
-hͿ, where it acts as a bound morpheme. In this construction, -hͿ may have
scope over a wide array of phrases from verb roots and independent nouns to
fully-fledged verbal clauses. In this way, -hͿ forms a phonological unit together
with -wara, and may behave as if it were an independent coordinating particle
hͿwara ‘but’.
    In the present analysis, the “but”-concessive clause is regarded as a nomi-
nalised verb that is subordinated to a matrix clause. In these respects, it is
similar to other adverbial clauses. It differs from the other constructions in that
the “but”-concessive clause requires an extra element wara in order to be sub370.This example relates to our mysterious friend Saravi. No-one in Rondônia had been
    able to establish his ethnic identity. He was shot dead in 1995 in Vilhena by a
    rancher for something he did not do. Note that the first -le in this example means
    ‘only, just’ (‘nothing but hair’).
646   8. Subordination and coordinationordinated to the matrix clause. Under the analysis of wara as a cliticised parti-
cle, this concessive construction can be regarded as an analytical equivalent of
the more synthetic concessive construction with -lete, which was discussed in
(8.2.2.1.).
    The following examples represent the most basic occurrence of the “but”-
concessive:(3426)   hy'ja-hͿ=wara        kãu-'he-tse
         fall-NOM=but         break-NEG-DEC
         ‘fell but did not break’(3427)   kwa'za-dy-nãi are'ta-da-hͿ=waraja     mãrİ̘'?a-dy-nãi

         ‘although I know the Kwaza language, I already understand the

         die-POT-NOM=but         still-DEC
         ‘it’s wounded but it is still living’(3430)   ãwͿi-rjͿ-'he-tsy-hͿ=wara           aru-nͿ-tõi-'he-tse
         see-CD:area-NEG-GER-NOM=but place-REF-CL:eye-NEG-DEC
         ‘he does not see but does not use glasses. / he does not see, neverthe-
         less he does not use glasses’In the above examples, the verbal base of the subordinate clause was nomi-
nalised by -hͿ and subordinated to the matrix clause through cliticisation of
wara. In the following example, -hͿ- is a lexicalised part of the verbal base
waihͿ- ‘to be beautiful’. Instead of a subsequent nominaliser, =wara is at-
tached to the verbal base immediately:(3431)   kwa'za-dy-nãi      wai.'hͿ=wara are'ta-da-rai-he-ki
         Kwaza-POS-NOM beautiful=but understand-1S-damn-NEG-DEC
         ‘Kwaza is beautiful but I don’t know a thing’
                                                     8.2. Adverbial clauses   647The expected form *waihͿhͿwara was rejected. This example suggests above
all that although the combination of wai- ‘to be good’ with the element -hͿ- has
a lexicalised meaning of ‘be beautiful’, the same element -hͿ- has preserved
certain grammatical functions. Here, it combines its lexicalised status with its
nominalising subordinating status.
    Note that the predicate of the concessive clause may also be nominalised by
another morpheme such as the temporal nominaliser -wy:(3432)   si aky'nͿda'nͿ     ja-'he-da-wy=wara 'İ-tse
         I friend still     eat-NEG-1S-time=but go-DEC
         ‘(my) friend went away while I had not yet eaten’   The next examples show that in combination with wara, the nominaliser can
have the scope over an entire sentence in the declarative mood. Arguments em-
bedded in the concessive clause may even intervene between its predicate and
the concessive particle:(3433)   oja-e'te-da-tsy-tse       zezƭju-dy-'rjͿ      hͿ=wa'ra
         go-COMIT-1S-POT-DEC       Zezinho-POS-DC:area NOM=but         he'?ai -da-ki
         want.not-1S-DEC
         ‘we are going together to Zezinho, but I don’t want to, no’(3434)   e'tay     eto'hoi a'sa-tse       hͿ=wara huru'ja-lİ-ki
         woman child         leave-DEC NOM=but like-RECI-DEC
         ‘he left wife and children, but nevertheless they loved each other very
         much’These examples suggest of course that -hͿ is not a bound nominalising mor-
pheme any more, but that it has obtained a semi-independent status. If the dis-
course context allows, the conjunctional “particle” can even be “inflected” for
person.(3435)   da-hͿ=wa'ra mãrİ̘'?a-dy-nãi       pİ̘rİ̘'jã-nãi 'e-da-ki
         1S-NOM=but spirit-POS-NOM         speak-NOM have-1S-DEC
         ‘nevertheless I know the Western man’s language’Possibly, the verb root that originally preceded -dahͿwara is understood and
has been omitted. These phenomena of ellipsis and cliticisation were further
discussed in (7.5.). In the following example, hͿwara is used even more inde-
pendently:
648   8. Subordination and coordination(3436)   hͿ=wa'ra     hu-'ra
         NOM=but      smoke-IMP
         ‘nevertheless, smoke!’It was said in a situation in which the hearer had declined an offered smoke but
where the speaker insisted. Here it is possible to maintain that nothing is omit-
ted, but that hͿwara is used as a context-dependent pragmatic particle. In an-
other situation the speaker uttered hͿwara as a single phrase in the figurative
sense of ‘never mind’ or ‘it is no problem’. Here the speaker had offered the
visiting hearer his hammock but the hearer had objected that he had come in
from the rain and that his clothes were wet. The speaker again reacted to this by
hͿwara ‘never mind’. As an equivalent expression he could also have said
na'nãi?Ϳky'wy ‘it is O.K. like that’.
    In quoted speech constructions the concessive conjunction can be realised
through the extended particle tsyhͿwara ‘think that, but’ (see 5.5.11.). There
are other conditions which relate to the element -tsy-. In (8.1.2.3.) it is ex-
plained how -hͿ cannot be preceded immediately by future -nã-, but that -tsy-
has to intervene. This requirement also holds for hͿwara:(3437)   wãwͿi-'nã-tsy-hͿ=wara            tsile'ta    tsile'ta-tja
         sleep-FUT-GER-NOM=but            afternoon   afternoon-CSO         a'wͿi=xare-ri'tsa-hͿ=wara          jerexwa-'le
         see=turn-DR:outside-NOM=but jaguar-only
         ‘(..., and) went to sleep, but early in the night she looked outside, but
         there was a jaguar!’ (t)Notice with respect to the latter example also that the difference between the
subject of the but-clause and the matrix clause does not require formal mark-
ing.
   Notice with respect to the counterfactual concessive example (3348) in
(8.2.1.2.1.) that the but-clause can also refer to a possible non-realised fact.","[678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686]"

8.3.2.2. Indefinite different subject: -dwa-The morpheme -dwa- is a variant of the indefinite subject cross-reference
marker -wa- (see 5.1.4.1.). It occurs only in the medial clause and it co-refers
with the indefinite subject of the next clause. It does not agree with the subject
of the present clause, but it indicates that the subject of the next clause is in-
definite, and that it is different from the subject of the present clause. Here are
some examples from texts by different narrators:(3587)    e'tay     aky'hͿ au're-dwa-ta wã'rͅ-dy-ta-wa-si

may have an inchoative effect. Compare the following example to the subse-
quent ones:(3595)   hade'ja-cwa-ta                   (3596)    si'le-dwa-ta

         ‘it is starting to dawn’
8.3.2.3. Switch reference mood: -siThe verb-root extension -dy- as discussed in (8.3.2.1.) is used to mark third
person switch reference. The next question is: how to indicate switch reference
with other persons? As explained above, the subject of a medial clause ending
in -ta is usually identical to the subject of the matrix clause. Because subject
identity finds expression in overt and covert coreferent person marking, one
would expect that non-coreferent person marking would suffice to indicate dif-
ferent subjects. However, things are not as straightforward as that. The proper
way to mark switch reference between non-third person subjects involves two
morphological operations. In the first place, there is overt non-coreferent per-
son subject marking. In the second place the medial clause ending -ta is re
682    8. Subordination and coordinationplaced by another medial clause ending -si. The element -si indicates that the
subject of the subsequent verb is different from that of the current verb. The
contrast between the following examples illustrates its use:(3598)    'kwİ-da-ta       atxitxi-'nǊ       'ja-da-ki
          enter-1S-CSO maize-CL:powder eat-1S-DEC
          ‘I entered and ate maize porridge’(3599)    'kwİ-da-si      ho'Bİto atxitxi-'nǊ        wa'dy-ta-ki
          enter-1S-SWR Roberto maize-CL:powder give-1O-DEC
          ‘I entered and Roberto gave me maize porridge’The hypothesis that -si indicates a switching referent explains why *kwİ-da-si
atxitxi-nǊ ja-da-ki, cf. example (3598), was considered uninterpretable by the
consultant.
   There is no functional difference between the switch reference markers -dy-
and -si. The consultant claimed that they meant the same thing, which is cor-
roborated by the contrast between (3563) and (3600), and by (3601):(3600)    (si) 'kwİ-da-si       mau'risiju wa'dy-ki      'Bousa          txi?a-'wã
          I      enter-1S-SWR Maurício       give-DEC bag                Txi?a-AO
          ‘I entered and Maurício gave the bag to Txi?a’(3601)    onİ-'si      oja-'ta-da-hͿ-ki
          arrive-SWR leave-TRA-1S-NOM-DEC
          ‘he returned, I went there’In the above examples, the subordinated verb and the matrix verb express two
successive events. Verbs in the switch reference mood can also function as
complement clauses of perception verbs:390(3602)    la'to        dutu're tsutsu-'si        ã'wͿi-da-ki
          yesterday pig          piss-SWR        see-1S-DEC
          ‘yesterday I saw a pig pissing’(3603)    zjwã-'wã cari=a'sa-wa-si        hary'ky e'tay-tjate            Ǌtje'nãi-ki

          ‘they killed João but now his wife found out’Furthermore, it seems that -si also has a strong tendency to mark the subordi-
nated verb as a reason clause or maybe even a condition clause:
390.Note that -si can be replaced by nominalisers like -hͿ and -nãi practically without
    consequences for the meaning of the following sentences (see 8.4.).

markers -dy- and -si. Whereas -dy- indicates a different third person subject, -si
indicates difference between a third person and a non-third person subject:391.A more correct translation would be probably ‘because he doesn’t force me’.
392.Note that phoneme fluctuation between /s/ and /ts/ has resulted in /-si/ being pro-
    nounced as [tsi] in this and the next example. In van der Voort (2000c:220, exx. 243
    and 244) the phonetic sequence -tsi was mistaken for the monitory mood morpheme
    and these examples were translated as: ‘lest we don’t club them, they run away’ and
    ‘it gets soft lest we don’t cook it long enough’ / ‘unless we fail to cook it long
    enough, it gets soft’. They were regarded as examples of a special construction in-
    volving the reverse sense of English ‘lest’, or, the mirror image of ‘unless’, which
    was attributed to the intrinsic negative sense of monitory -tsi. This illustrates how
    easily the linguist can stray in his or her wish to make sense of unusual data under all

two instances of coreferent subject marking in switch reference medial clause
constructions were recorded:394(3620)   erewe-'xy-da-si         kukui-ko'je-da-ki
         write-CL:leaf-1S-SWR hurt-CL:hand-1S-DEC
         ‘it is because of writing that my finger is hurting’(3621)   mãrİ̘'?a-da-hͿ-'si     Ǌce'nãi-da-rai-re
         spirit-1S-NOM-SWR know-1S-damn-INT
         ‘being a Westerner, I know bugger-all’(3622)   au're-e-nã-si           co-'e-nã-ki
         marry-again-one-SWR     many-again-one-DEC
         ‘because we married again, we (multiplied and) grew again’Instead of the medial clause switch reference marker -si one would have ex-
pected same reference -ta, because the subjects of the cosubordinated and ma-
trix clauses are identical. Maybe the switch reference marker does not relate to
a discontinuity of the grammatical function of subject across the sentence, but
rather to discontinuity of some pragmatic function. Reesink (1983, 1987) and
Dik (1997a:322) note about a reverse situation in a Papuan language, where
subject switches do not necessarily lead to the expected different subject
marking, that switch reference can be used to indicate topic (dis)continuity.
    In (8.3.1.9.) and (8.3.2.1.) it was demonstrated that medial clause markers
may also occur as resumptive particles in the discourse together with person
marking. The same holds for the switch reference mood marker in combination
with person cross reference.(3623)   cwa-si
         IS-SWR
         ‘it is’, ‘now then’, ‘well’In fact, these grammatical morphemes, which are usually encountered as clitics
to verb stems, resume the continuity or indicate the discontinuity of semantic,
pragmatic or grammatical properties of the preceding utterance. This also oc-
curs in dialogues:
394.It should be mentioned here that both sentences were not procured from running
    texts, but they were offered by the consultant in isolation.

semantically relatively empty verb stem ehͿ- ‘make, do’, the result is a truly
independent word which means ‘well, so, then, thus’:(3625)   'nãi-cwa-ta 'a-wa-hͿ-ta'dy=jã-ki=tja     'ta-ja-ta

‘NOM’ and -si ‘SWR’, is presented in (7.7.2.). At any rate, this use of hehͿsi or
ehͿsi ‘well’ resembles “Tail-head linking” as described by De Vries (1989:204)
for certain Papuan languages.","[717, 718, 719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724]"

5.2.3. ImperativeThe imperative mood marker -ra is used to indicate the speech act of com-
manding by which the hearer can be required, requested or invited to do some-
thing. The imperative marker attracts stress.(1355)     wady-'ra                     (1356)     wa'dy-e'teja-'ra
           give-IMP                                give-1PO-IMP
           ‘give (it to him)!’                     ‘give (it) to us!’(1357)     e'tay-nahere-wã wa'dy-ja-'ra
           woman-COL-AO give-IO-IMP
           ‘give (it) to all women!’(1358)     Q:     İ-'nã-da-ki               A:     İ-'ra
                  go-FUT-1S-DEC                    go-IMP
                  ‘I’m going’                      ‘go!’182Two possible subjects have been attested for imperative verbs: second person
singular, which is zero-marked, and second person plural, which is marked by
-xa-. Zero-marking is explicitly indicated only in the first two of the examples
below:(1359)     ka'we     kui-Ø-'ra                   (1360)   ka'we     'kui-Ø-xa-'ra
           coffee drink-2-IMP                             coffee drink-2-AS-IMP
           ‘drink coffee!’ (2sg)                          ‘drink coffee!’ (2pl)(1361)     xyi'tsİ tͅi'tja    o'ja-xa-'ra
           you.PL alone       leave-AS-IMP
           ‘you are going without them!’ (2pl)(1362)     xyi'tsİ o'ja-e'te-xa-'ra        (*o'ja?e'texaxa'ra)
           you.PL leave-COMIT-AS-IMP
           ‘you are going with them!’ (2pl)These examples show that in contrast to the declarative, where unmarked per-
son represents third person, the default value of the imperative is second per182.According to MA this answer is a bit harsh. Nicer is: tsy're ‘would it be?’
302   5. The verb phraseson. The second person plural imperative is marked by -xa-, and this form con-
trasts with second person plural form -xa-xa- of the declarative and other
moods. The following examples represent strong evidence for this:(1363)    xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-ra                      xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-xa-ki
          you        hit-AS-IMP                   you       hit-2-AS-DEC
          ‘you hit!’                    vs.       ‘you hit’(1364)    xyi aky-'ta        e'mã-xa-xa-ta o'ja-xa-ra          Ba'hozo-na
          you two-ANI        more-2-AS-CSO leave-AS-IMP        Barroso-LOC
          ‘you three, go to Barroso!’As explained in (5.1.), the element -xa-xa- consists of the second person ele-
ment -xa- and a homophonous associated person marker -xa-. Considering the
fact that second person is zero-marked for the singular subject of the impera-
tive, it is likely that it is also zero-marked for a plural subject. Therefore, the
element -xa- in the second person plural imperative represents associated per-
son, and not second person.
    In spite of the fact that -xa- in most imperative sentences represents a plural
subject, there are examples of the imperative in which -xa- is used for second
person singular. In the next example, which is from a mythical tale, the en-
chanted tapir is being addressed by a group of women:(1365)    huruja=du'hͿ-İteja-xa-ra
          like=all-1PO-2-IMP
          ‘make love to us all!’ (t)Compare this example to (1356). The tapir from this tale is a singular being
with a solitary life. And far as I am aware no special register was used in this
tale. Therefore, I have interpreted -xa- as a second person subject marker.
    Imperative verbs were never attested bearing any other subject person
marking than either zero or -xa-. Imperative verbs can be marked for any kind
of object and the same forms are used as in the declarative, with one exception.
The declarative first person object -ta- corresponds to the imperative (and
monitory) first person singular object -ta?Ϳ-:(1366)    wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-'ra (*wadytara)          (1367)    aredy'ta-ta?Ϳ-'ra
          give-1SO-IMP                                  teach-1SO-IMP

          copulate-1SO-IMP say-DS-CSO
          ‘then she ordered him (Tapir) to fuck her’
                                                                   5.2. Mood   303(1369)   wa'dy-ta'?Ϳ-xa-'ra

         see-NOM-1SO-AS-IMP
         ‘help!’ (lit. ‘you pl. look at me!’)   The negative imperative is expressed by a different morpheme -ky, which
will be treated in (5.2.7.). Nevertheless, some instances of a negative mor-
pheme in combination with imperative -ra were attested. They are rather em-
phatic:(1371)   ehͿ-'he-ca-ra                   (1372)    ja-'he-ca-xa-ra
         make-NEG-EMP-IMP                          eat-NEG-EMP-2-IMP
         ‘don’t do that!’                          ‘(since you didn’t work)
                                                   you (PL) are nót going to eat!’Note that -ra is not immediately attached to negative -he- in this construction.
The intervening element -ca- will be discussed below in section (5.2.3.3.).
5.2.3.1. -tsy- as an imperative elementNo mitigated version of the imperative has been identified with absolute cer-
tainty. Sometimes the imperative can be expressed by an alternative construc-
tion which involves the potential/future morpheme -tsy-:(1373)   hako're    oja'nͿ-e-ra     / hako're             ojanͿ-'?e-xa-tsy-tse
         tomorrow return-again-IMP/ tomorrow              return-again-2-POT-DEC
         ‘tomorrow you (sg/pl) come again’The next examples show that the alternative imperative construction with po-
tential -tsy- may also be zero marked for second person just like the canonical
imperative construction is (note that both are embedded as reported speech
constructions, see 5.5.11.).(1374)   hã    mǊi-'ra-tsy-le-'hͿ                   bõ'rõ-tse
         water submerge-IMP-GER-FRUST-NOM perforate-DEC
         ‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’(1375)   hã    'mǊi-tsy-'tse-tsy-le-'hͿ                 bõ'rõ-tse
         water submerge-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM perforate-DEC
         ‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’
304   5. The verb phraseThe difference between overt and zero marked second person in the imperative
construction with potential -tsy- is discussed in section (8.1.1.1.).
    The consultant regarded the imperative content of the alternative expres-
sions as equally strong or equally nice. On one occasion, however, the potential
construction was indicated as a mitigated and possibly euphemistic alternative
to the imperative:(1376)   wayrjͿ-'ra          /      way'rjͿ-xa-tsy-tsİ
         clean-IMP                  clean-2-POT-DEC
         ‘clean!’                   ‘you may clean’
5.2.3.2. -ta as an imperative elementThe procrastinative morpheme -tara- ‘later’, ‘do first’ was discussed above and
demonstrated in example (1268). In the declarative it cannot precede -ki but
only -tsİ. In the imperative it can only be succeeded by a verb-final element -ta.
This element -ta is not a cosubordinative marker, as it is clearly imperative in
combination with -tara-.(1377)   e'hͿ-tara-'ta
         make-PROC-IMP
         ‘do that first! (before going away)’(1378)   ka'we 'kui-tara-'ta                       (1379)   here?ece-'hͿ-tara-'ta
         coffeedrink-PROC-IMP                               rest-NOM-PROC-IMP
         ‘drink coffee first!, wait for the coffee!’        ‘rest first!’Maybe -ta should be regarded as an allomorph of -ra, although it only occurs in
this construction. The morpheme -tara- is involved in several different con-
structions and will be treated by itself in section (5.5.19.).","[339, 340, 341, 342]"

8.3.2.1.2. Functions of different subject clausesAs was demonstrated in (8.3.1.7.) the medial clause may function as a com-
plement of cause or reason. This is also true for medial clauses marked for dif-
ferent third person subject:(3573)    ma'rija ra'tja-dy-ta   'İ-hͿ-ki                 zjwãu
          Maria order-DS-CSO leave-NOM-DEC                João
          ‘Maria made João go away’(3574)    awe-'nã-dy-ta        txarãi'xu    mã-'ki
          rain-FUT-DS-CSO frog              call-DEC
          ‘the frogs are calling because it is going to rain’(3575)    awe-tja'rjͿ-dy-ta         atxi'txi a'nǊ-ki
          rain-everywhere-DS-CSO maize plant-DEC
          ‘(as) it was raining much, he was planting/planted maize’
8.3.2.1.3. Different subject clauses and comparisonThe medial clause marked for different third person subject is also used to ex-
press a comparative sense:(3576)    'kopo      txuhǊƭ-'Ϳ-dy-ta        cͅrͅmǊ-'ro          nͿ-'ro-(hͿ)-ki
          cup        small-ATT-DS-CSO       milk-CL:cup         big-CL:cup-NOM-DEC
          ‘the tin of milk is bigger than the cup’
8.3.2.1.4. Different subject -dy- and causative -dy-The element which indicates different subject is homophonous with the bene-
factive/causative morpheme -dy- (see 5.4.3.). The translation given by the con-
sultant for the next example suggests a benefactive reading of -dy-, although
grammatical analysis probably warrants the conclusion that it represents the
different subject marker:
                                            8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses     677(3577)    wanã'dy txu'hǊi-Ϳ-dy-ta           ja-'he-tse
          food      small-ATT-DS-CSO        eat-NEG-DEC
          ‘there remained just a little food for him, he didn’t eat’388Notice furthermore the discussion about the examples of (8.3.2.1.1.) in which
-dy- may originate from a metaphorical use of the benefactive. It is possible
that the two categories of benefactive/causative and different subject are related
in some way. About the following example, it cannot be denied that the logical
subject of the verb root are- ‘transform’ is different from that of oja- ‘leave’:(3578)    ã'rǊi are-dy-da-'ta       o'ja-da-ki
          tapir turn-CAU-1S-CSO leave-1S-DEC
          ‘I made him turn into a tapir and I went away’Because of the fact that the formal subjects of the concomitant clauses in this
example are identical, non-third persons, the element -dy- is to be interpreted as
a causative marker.
   A clear formal difference between both morphemes may be that causative
-dy- tends to attract stress, whereas the different subject morpheme does not.389
My teacher MA pointed out to me the possibility of the following minimal pair:(3579)    cu-'dy-ta                               'cu-dy-ta
          cut-CAU-CSO                             cut-DS-CSO
          ‘he ordered him to cut’                 ‘he cut, and then...’He considered the similarity between these phrases as striking but said that they
were totally different in nature.
   The following example contains a verb in which both the causative mor-
pheme and the different subject marker cooccur:(3580)    diri-'dy-dy-ta           a'wͿi-ta
          descend-CAU-DS-CSO       see-CSO
          ‘she(i) made him descend and she(j) saw him’ (t)Maybe one could say that causative -dy- causes a switch of subjects within the
verb stem, and different subject -dy- causes a switch of subjects across a com-
plex clause construction.
388.‘ficou pouquinho para ele, não comeu’
389.Since it does not even receive secondary stress, the different subject marker is often
    almost inaudible in narrative texts and its presence can be reconstructed from a
    pause.
678   8. Subordination and coordination8.3.2.1.5. Discourse particles and discontinuityIn (8.3.1.9.) it was shown how cosubordinative markers are sometimes used as
particles. The same seems to be possible with different third person subjects:(3581)   zjwãu     'a-tja       'marju       'a-tja      hͿ-dy-ta
         João      exist-CSO    Mario        exist-CSO   NOM-DS-CSO         tsiri'tsa 'a-ki       'peDro

   nothing like-2-DEC expose-IMP kill-1S-CSO devour-1S-VOL
   ‘“that isn’t you, no way, you have hidden someone” she said to her, “whom
   did I hide?, I didn’t” she said, well, “you’re lying, get him out of there!, I
   will kill him and devour him”’ (t)The examples show how the combined different subject and cosubordinative
markers behave as if they were a free morpheme. In the proper context, the
element (hͿ)dyta is interpreted as a discourse particle with the approximated
senses of ‘well, while, as, when, then’. Grammatically, it remains an instrument
to express switch reference, but it has also a connotation of counter-

discontinuity of third person subjects across a complex sentence, but it may

rarer occasions it was attested how -dy-ta, besides functioning as a switch ref-
erence marker, was associated with termination of the event expressed by the
verb:(3585)    barİ-dy-'mǊ-dy-ta                      (3586)     wara'ñͿ-dy-ta

          ‘he finished heating up the water’ (t)            ‘he finished working’So the element -dy- is used to express discontinuity in a more general sense as
well.

as it is by further person and mood marking. In that position it has a preventive
connotation. This resembles those constructions involving causational use of
-ni (see 5.2.4.1.) and volitional use of -da-mͿ (see 5.2.5.1.). Only a few in-
stances of preventive modal use of -tsi were attested:(1518)    e'nãi-tja-eteja-'tsi-xa-xa-ta         areta-'nã-xa-xa-ki
          quarrel-TRA-1PO-MON-2-AS-CSO know-FUT-2-AS-DEC
          ‘for him not to quarrel with you, therefore you’re going to learn”
           (lit. ‘in order for you to (say) “don’t let him quarrel with us!” you’re
           going to learn (your lesson)’)Note in this example that the second person plural object is expressed by a first
person plural object morpheme. This construction, which is to be understood
from the literal translation, is identical to that in quoted speech and other op-
erations discussed in (5.5.11-14.). It seems likely that the construction derives
from cliticisation or the resumptive particle strategy, which were discussed in
(7.5.2.3.) and (7.5.2.2.) respectively.
   Of the following example it is not understood why the (third person) plural
object is expressed by a (first person) singular object morpheme:(1519)    e'nãi-tja-ta?Ϳ-'tsi-tja       areta-'nã-tse
          quarrel-TRA-1SO-MON-CSO know-FUT-DEC
          ‘for him not to quarrel with them, they want to learn’Being a sentence from an entire elicited paradigm, its translation may be
somewhat independable. Probably, ‘them’ and ‘they’ should be ‘him’ and ‘he’
respectively. The fact that the object is literally a first person is obviously a
consequence of the quotative nature of the construction.
     Some other ill-understood semi-lexicalised uses of preventive -tsi are dis-
cussed in section (7.1.2.) because they involve the emphatic negative element
-ƭ-.","[363, 364]"

5.5.31.   Repetitive -(je)?e-There is a frequently used repetitive morpheme -e-, which means ‘to do again’.
Often it receives stress. Note the following examples:(2381)    kui-'e-a-hͿ-ki                   (2382)     txa 'a-e-ki

          (themselves)’ (t)                           heats up again’)   The repetitive can also cover the sense of ‘more’:(2385)    kui-'e-da-mͿ
          drink-again-1S-VOL
          ‘I’ll drink more’   There is a morphophonological variant of -e-: -je?e-. It is obligatory when
preceded by a negative morpheme:(2386)    oja-'he-je?e-'nã-da-ki      (2387)     kui-'he-je?e-'nã-da-ki

          ‘I’m not going there again’            ‘I’m not going to drink more’However, the element -je- is optional in non-negative contexts:(2388)    'kwİ-(je)?e-da-ki             (2389)   o'ja-(je)?e-wa-ki

ture marking yields a future interpretation, even when the future is expressed

          bathe-again-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘I’m going to take a bath again’    Under ellipsis of the verb root in the proper context (see 7.5.2.), the repeti-
tive functions as an independent verbal root:(2395)    je'e-da-ki
          again-1S-DEC
          ‘I (spoke, did, went, etc.) again’Note that the allomorph -je?e- has to be used in this construction. This could
suggest that, in the other examples, the allomorph is in reality a compound verb
root to which -e- is attached. However, the verb root je- means ‘to dig’, and it
is unlikely that this is semantically related to -je?e- ‘again’. It seems also un-
likely that there is a relation with the directional -je- ‘away’ (see 5.3.1.).
    The repetitive morpheme -e can be attached word-finally to a noun. The re-
sult is a noun with the meaning ‘too, also’. This is discussed in (4.4.6.).","[500, 501]"

5.5.14.2. Deductive conjecture: apparential -tehere and -cehereThe apparential morpheme -tehere occurs verb-finally. It expresses more often
the sense of conjecture or assumption than the embedded variant -here- does.
Besides this, it may also express a suspicion, an indirect question or an opinion
on behalf of the speaker.
   The general function of -tehere seems to be deductive evidentiality. Com-
pare the following examples:

          father hungry-2-CSO like-2-NOM-APPR
          ‘father, I think you are hungry’ (t)   From the translations, it is not very clear whether -tehere represents an im-
personal statement, or whether it has a first person connotation in Kwaza. Some
examples were translated both ways:(2139)    ka'tay kukui'hͿ-tehere
          agouti ill-APPR
          ‘I think João is ill / would João be ill?’251   The next example, which represents a quotation construction (see 5.5.11.),
contains explicit reference to the conjecturing first person:(2140)    jere'xwa-(*wã) / wa'wͿi-xay-nãi         he'?ai-xa-tehe're-da-ki
          jaguar-AO       / sleep-2-NOM           want.not-2-APPR-1S-DEC
          ‘I think you don’t want a dog / to sleep / etc.’The alternative second translation of the following elliptic example suggests
that the person and mood markers succeeding -tehere also resulted from a
quotation construction:251.katay ‘agouti’ is a nickname.

          APPR-1S-CSO       like-1S-DEC
          ‘I think like this’, ‘I think yes’The next example is a quotation construction in which a first person is implicit.
It means literally: ‘hei thinks: “hej seems to be afraid”‘ and “hej” is identical
with the speaker in the actual discourse context:(2142)    we-tehe're-tse
          fear-APPR-DEC
          ‘he thinks I am afraid’Note also the following example:(2143)    kukui'hͿ-da-tehe're-tse
          ill-1S-APPR-DEC
          ‘he thinks he is ill’ (even when he isn’t ill)The examples (2140), (2141), (2142) and (2143) obviously represent quotation
constructions. Hence, it is likely that, in those instances where no person cross-
reference marking follows -tehere, it represents an impersonal deduction ‘it
seems’. Where it is translated as ‘I think’ or ‘I wonder’, this is just because the
speaker, who utters the deduction, is always a first person. Thus, it does not
represent the grammatical perspective of Kwaza, and the choice between the
translations ‘it seems’ and ‘I think’ depends on coincidence.
   Another alternative variant of the apparential morpheme is -cehere. It seems
equivalent to -tehere in all respects:(2144)    maga'riDa onİ-'he-cehere
          Margarida come-NEG-APPR
          ‘maybe Margarida did not arrive’252(2145)    'ja       ãwͿi-xa-'hͿ-cehere         (2146)   kreBa-'na oja-'nã-cehere

of -tehere:

                ‘would it be Vera?’                 ‘must be’It is possible that the locative case may precede -tehere, but this cannot be
firmly established because of the want of comparative data:(2149)   'txarwa 'posto-na-cehere
         first    Posto-LOC-APPR
         ‘he could be in Posto now / he must be in Posto now’It seems that the negative may not be immediately adjacent to -tehere:(2150)   kukuihͿ-'he-cehere

         ‘I think no-one screamed’                  ‘I think someone screamed’These examples suggest that -cehere is only partially an optional morphopho-
nological variant of -tehere.
    The morpheme -tehere also plays a role in ‘(n)either ... (n)or’ constructions
involving the particle hele, which are discussed in (7.7.3.).
    The following examples indicate that the apparential morpheme -tehere can
also occur in an emphatic cleft construction involving the auxiliary verb root

ples (2152) to (2155) do not have an appellative sense.","[458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463]"

7.1.1.5. Negative -he- and ellipsisThe negative morpheme -he- also seems to occur as a verb root or even as a
negative particle. This use of -he- is only possible in the proper context. There-
fore, in the present analysis this is regarded as the result of ellipsis, which is
discussed in (7.5.).",[566]
"
7.5.4. Discontinuous predicatesIn the present section it will be demonstrated how verbal inflexional mor-
phemes can be separated by other sentence constituents from the verb root to
which they belong.
   There is in Kwaza morphology no clear evidence of circumfixation, i.e.,
there are no discontinuous bound morphemes. However, morphologically com-
plex words can be expressed discontinously. With one exception, this phe-
nomenon was exclusively observed in narrations. In the following example, the
verb root wİ- ‘to bring’ occurs independently, is then succeeded by a noun that
is marked for locative case, after which comes a third person cosubordinative
marker:(3169)   'wİkaricwa-'na      tja    'a-ete-ta
         bring field-LOC CSO exist-COMIT-CSO
         ‘took (the children) to the old field and lived there together’ (t)It seems unlikely that wİ- forms a compound with the subsequent noun or that
the locative noun is zero-verbalised by -tja, or both. The same thing occurs in
the next example, where the satellite argument uruna ‘in the patua palm tree’
intervenes between a verb root and its inflexion:(3170)   ale-'e   tana o'ri-tja   a-toto      'bu=Ǌ-cwa
         axe-with well ascend-CSO Ø-DR:upward put=be-DR:high         u'ru-na      tja
         patua-LOC CSO
         ‘with his axe he climbed up and sat high up there in the patua tree’ (t)
592    7. Other morphosyntactic structuresIn the next example the verb root ta- ‘to talk’ is separated from a cosubordina-
tive marker -tja by the inflected noun etohoitjatewã:(3171)    'İ-a-te=jã-'rjͿ=wara               nãi-'re le'ja-rai-ki='tja
          go-1P-PURP=be-CD:area=but          like-INT ahead-damn-DEC=CSO          ta     etohoi-tja'te-wã tja  'ta-ta
          talk child-3.POS-AO CSO talk-CSO
          ‘“...now that direction where we are headed, (jaguar) went ahead,
          damned!” she said talking to her son’ (t)Again, this -tja does not mark the preceding noun as quoted speech.345 Note,
however, that the verb root ta- is preceded by another cosubordinative marker
-tja which does indicate that the preceding sentence represents quoted speech.
It may be that structures like these have led to the reinterpretation of tjata- as a
verb root ‘to say’. In the next example no specific verb root at all is to be found
to which -tja belongs:(3172)    a'ha-here-da-hͿ-ta'dy           jere'xwa-tady    ƭ'wã
          father-INTL-1S-NOM-EXCL         jaguar-EXCL      nothing          hu'hui=asa-ty='jo-ty-eteja-hͿ-ta'dy=jã-ki

          ‘“bloody hell, I thought it was your father, however it is a jaguar, who
          killed him from us, and devoured him from us, that is what it is!” she
          said to her child’ (t)Here, -tja may have the function of marking the preceding sentence as quoted
speech, but, like in (3171), it can be excluded that the case marked noun which
precedes it belongs to the quotation. Another possibility is that -tja functions as
a resumptive element here. However, it is followed again by the verb ta- ‘to
talk’, hence it is also possible that the reanalysis of -tja ta- to tjata- has been
implemented here.
    The discontinuous predicate may also be inflected by other forms than -tja.
The next example shows how the verb root hadai- ‘to cut, bite’ is separated by
a noun from the different subject morpheme -dyta:
345.etohoi ‘child’ can be used vocatively in Kwaza, but not when followed by possessive
    and case markers.

          ‘as the men all moved away, moved away, just the women remained
          there, what a pity!’ (t)In the subsequent example, the verb stem jã'si-tjarjͿ- ‘to hear everywhere, to
probe’ is separated from the inflexion by an adverb:(3175)    'hİ-na       'bukja-ta      jã'si-tjarjͿ    akwa'te dy-ta
          mortar-LOC lie-CSO          hear-everywhere inside DS-CSO
          ‘it was lying down at the foot of the mortar, listening all the time to
          the sounds inside, as...’ (t)With respect to adverbs, it may be possible that they are compounded with a
verb root and then verbalised, as in example (3097) of section (7.4.2.).
   There is one exception to the statement that this morphological discontinuity
phenomenon was only attested in narrative texts:(3176)    axe'hͿ kǊ'cͅ          da-'ki

          [verb    noun         inflexion]
          ‘I found Maurício’346   Probably, constructions like the ones illustrated in the present subsection,
except for (3175), emerge from ellipsis of verbal inflexion. This inflexion then346.kǊcͅ ‘Brazil nut’ is a nickname of Maurício. This example was encountered on the
    tape containing formally elicited speech from Vasconcelos’s (±1993) field work in-
    terview with Mario. One could have doubts about the value of this example because
    at the time of this interview, Mario had never before done any linguistic fieldwork,
    and furthermore this was only the sixth utterance on the tape.
594    7. Other morphosyntactic structures(re)appears after some other constituent as a resumptive particle, or as an af-
terthought. It could be that this is a recent development in Kwaza, and that the
language is becoming more and more isolating. As mentioned earlier, and with
the exception of (3176), these discontinuous constructions were never encoun-
tered in formally elicited speech. Although elicited speech data may not be re-
garded as more “authentic” than textual data, they do reflect certain attitudes of
the speakers with regard to the structure of the language. If this suggests that
the speakers of Kwaza find the structures of elicited speech more “ideal” than
those they produce in texts, one may wonder what the nature of this ideal is and
where it comes from.","[629, 630, 631, 632]"

8.3.1.8. Some morphosyntactic aspects of cosubordinationThe linear order of cosubordinated clauses does not seem to be so strict that the
matrix clause always has to follow the medial clause. Compare example (3473)
to the following:(3529)    dodotxi'te ohui-'nã-tja        o'ja-tse
          ball         play-FUT-CSO leave-DEC
          ‘he went there to play ball’381According to the consultant, there was no meaning difference between the al-
ternative orders. In the following examples, the order is iconic:381.Alternative order: 312.
                                          8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses   667(3530)   de'da     Ǌceta-'tõi-ki      haku'ri-(wã) kui-da'mͿ-tja

         ‘snake is encircling the moon in order to swallow it’(3531)   'makina dai-'nã-tse        awͿi-ja-'nã-tja
         camera grab-FUT-DEC see-IO-FUT-CSO
         ‘he is going to take/find his camera in order to take a picture’In many examples the order encountered was not subjected to a requirement of
iconicity. Also, the question of which verb should represent the matrix predi-
cate and which verb the cosubordinated predicate is not always easy to solve.(3532)   (ui)     hu-'nã-tja        'İ-ki
         tobacco smoke-FUT-CSO go-DEC
         ‘she went (home) to smoke a cigarette’(3533)   'İ-tja   'hu-ki
         go-CSO smoke-DEC
         ‘she went (home) and is smoking’The medial clause example (3532) has a purposive function due to the Future
marker -nã-, whereas example (3533) just sums up the subsequent events in an
iconic order. The next example is structurally a blend of the above examples:(3534)   'İ-da-ta     here?etje-hͿ-'nã-da-ki
         go-1S-CSO rest-NOM-FUT-1S-DEC
         ‘I’ll go away and relax’In this example, the order is iconic and the function of one of the clauses may
be purposive. However, the consultant MA explained that the reverse order
*here?etje-'nã-da-ta İ-da-ki would make no sense as “it is the wrong way
round”, even though it corresponds structurally to (3532). There is no pur-
posive sense involved in the next iconically ordered sentence:(3535)   tͅjã'wã-ki awe-'nã-tja
         dark-DEC rain-FUT-CSO
         ‘it is getting dark; it will rain’No systematic (field) research on constituent order was done, and the issue will
not be pursued any further here.
668   8. Subordination and coordination8.3.1.9. Lengthy medial clause chains and discourse particlesIn elicited cosubordinative constructions there is usually a matrix verb in the
declarative mood which comes at the end of the clause chain. In running texts
there is usually no concluding matrix verb. Matrix verb mood forms are then
mostly used to indicate quoted speech. However, traditional and mythological
tales usually do end in a formula bearing the declarative mood form -ki. Proba-
bly, the entire story can be regarded as a long clause chain, terminated by a
symbolic matrix clause. The majority of the texts in part (II) of the present
work are structured and terminated like this. The following text excerpt con-
tains a lengthy clause chain:(3536)   eto'hoi-nahere-wã       hͿ'dİ ja-Ϳ-'rjͿ      kari'cwa-na
         child-COL-AO            go! DIST-ATT-CD:area field-LOC         'İ-a-ta   'a-a-ta                atxi'txi   mani'ni-tsy-hͿ
         go-1P-CSO exist-1P-CSO           maize      fish-GER-NOM         hu'de-a-ta 'ja-a-ta         a-a-'ni=tja         'ta-ta
         dry-1P-CSO eat-1P-CSO exist-1P-EXH=CSO talk-CSO
         ‘“let’s go there to the old field, we go there, we’ll live there, we’ll dry
         and eat maize and fish, let’s live there!” she said, speaking to her
         children’ (t)In this example, the first four medial clauses are subordinated to an exhortative
matrix clause. That matrix clause represents quoted speech and is embedded in
a medial clause, which again is cosubordinated with another medial clause and
an implicit matrix clause. The story from which this excerpt is taken ends fi-
nally with the declarative verb ta-ki ‘she said’ and is followed by the formula
cwa-rati-ki ‘that is what they say’. All the other matrix mood clauses in the
story represent quoted speech.
    The attachment of a cosubordinative morpheme to a fully inflected clause
such as the exhortative in (3536) or the volitive in (3537), represents the mor-
phological operation of cliticisation which occurs especially in quoted speech
constructions:(3537)   cutİ-da-'mͿ=tja
         fell-1S-VOL=CSO
         ‘“I’m going to fell trees”, he said’ (t)In such constructions, it may occur that the cliticised cosubordination mor-
pheme is preceded by a small pause as if it represents an independent word or
particle. Narratives are filled with such particles and it is possible to discuss
their meaning with the consultants. One consultant (TE) said that -tja is used
“only when telling a story you know that happened or which you witnessed
                                          8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses   669someone else tell”.382 He translated -tja as ‘he thought’, cwahͿ as ‘they
thought’ and cwata as ‘they thought’ or ‘they said’. Sometimes such particles
are translated as if they are pronouns. E.g. tja has been translated as ‘he’. On
another occasion -tja was translated as ‘yes’. About cwa(ta) it was said that it
is used “when one retells what someone else told, but you don’t know the ori-
gin of the story”.383 If one were aware of their reported speech function, one
would easily analyse some free occurrences of such morphemes as pronominal:(3538)    tja    'İ-ki
          CSO    go-DEC
          ‘he said thus, and went away’In fact, these particles can be used as resumptive morphemes and they can even
be inflected for person. As an example, the first person cosubordinative form
-data is, as a particle, translated by consultants both as ‘I said’ or as ‘well, then
I ...’:384(3539)    e'nãi-tja-ta-tsy-'tse      da-ta     areta-'nã-da-ki
          quarrel-TRA-1O-POT-DEC 1S-CSO know-FUT-1S-DEC
          ‘he is going to quarrel with me, so I, I’m going to learn’    It is unlikely that the verb root ta- ‘to talk’ originates from a reinterpreted
cosubordinative mood marker -ta. However, the element tja- in the verb root
tjata- ‘to say to someone’ may very well be:(3540)    ti-'nãi-tsy-re        mã       ta-dy-'ta
          what-like-that.be-INT mother talk-DS-CSO
          ‘“where is your mother?” he said to him’ (t)(3541)    xa-'he-tsy-tse       İ-'ra      mã        cari-hata-'tsi=tja

          talk-NOM=but
          ‘“don’t you persist, go away!, lest your mother will kill you” she said,
          however (unfortunately)...’ (t)Reported speech cliticisation and ellipsis are discussed more thoroughly in
(5.5.11.1.) and (7.5.2.3.).382.'só contando que você sabe ou que viu a pessoa contando'
383.'recontando que outro falou, mas você não conhece o dono da historia'
384.'aí eu', 'falei'
670    8. Subordination and coordination8.3.1.10. Coordination through cosubordinationKwaza does not have true coordinating conjunctions (see also 8.5.). Juxtaposi-
tion of two subsequent matrix clauses simply represents two separate sen-
tences, and not two coordinated clauses within one sentence:(3542)     hary'ky ja          ja=hã'rã-da-ki      nǊ'ri-da-ki
           now       already eat=stop-1S-DEC satiate-1S-DEC
           ‘I already stopped eating, I’m full’385Note that juxtaposed matrix clauses may function as complement clauses in
semantic respects and that the subjects do not have to be identical:(3543)     hã'te-ra     ti-'nãi-tja          Ǌ'nã-re
           count-IMP what-NOM-CSO            long-INT
           ‘try what length it has (i.e. measure it)!’(3544)     dyte'nã-a-ni            wãwͿi-wa-ni
           extinguish-1P-EXH       sleep-IS-EXH
           ‘let’s extinguish the candle so they can get some sleep!’However, consecutiveness of events is usually expressed through medial and
matrix clauses which together constitute a subordinating rather than a coordi-
nating construction. Nevertheless, the translations offered by the consultant of
several of the examples in the present chapter, such as (3469), (3484), (3500),
(3507) and (3555), suggest that medial clauses function as coordinated clauses.
    As explained in (4.3.) Kwaza does not possess the category of adjectives but
it has verb roots with an attributive content. When verbs based on semantically
attributive roots are cosubordinated, they have the translation value of coordi-
nated adjectives:(3545)     mangka-'to        hoi-'tja     tãi-'he-tse
           mango-CL:fruit    sweet-CSO tough-NEG-DEC
           ‘the mangoes are sweet and soft’   Coordination of nouns can be realised through juxtaposition of bare nouns
(see also 8.5.):(3546)     meza-'na      kore'ja di'hu-tse
           table-LOC knife          spoon-DEC
           ‘on the table there is a knife and a spoon’
385.*hary'ky ja'jahã'rãda'ta nu'ridaki was considered “wrong” by MA, just as *hary'ky
    ja'jahã'rãdaki nu'rida'ta, about which MA said “it is like writing from back to front”.
                                       8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses   671However, the cosubordinating morpheme -t(j)a is also employed in construc-
tions containing coordinated nominals:(3547)   meza-'na      kore'ja-tja di'hu-tse
         table-LOC knife-CSO spoon-DEC
         ‘on the table there is a knife and a spoon’The words koreja ‘knife’ and dihu ‘spoon’ are nouns. In this example both
nouns are verbalised and cosubordinated. The literal translation could be: ‘on
the table being a knife, there is a spoon’. The following example suggests that
the entire verbalised cosubordinated construction can function as the argument
of a matrix verb, as if it were a complex noun:(3548)   kaiku'cİ̘-tja  arikwã'jǊ-tse hanã'wã-na          'a-ki
         KaikucİҔ-CSO ArikwãjǊ-DEC heaven-LOC             exist-DEC
         ‘ArikwãjǊ and KaikucİҔ live in heaven’Maybe the whole utterance should be regarded as bisentential, translated liter-
ally as: ‘they are ArikwãjǊ and KaikucİҔ, they live in heaven’. A partially simi-
lar construction was attested with the comitative morpheme -dynͿ, which is a
purely nominal suffix:(3549)   hyriko'ro-xwanã-tja     atxitxi'?Ǌ-tja hari?i'xu-dynͿ 'ja-da -ki
         monkey-CL:flesh-CSO     rice-CSO         bean-COMIT   eat-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m eating monkey meat, rice and beans’   Numerals are also easily used as verb stems. Complex numerals may be ex-
pressed as a cosubordinated verbalised construction:(3550)   bwa-ko'je-tja   aky-'hͿ-tse
         end-CL:hand-CSO two-NOM-DEC
         ‘(it is) seven’(3551)   tei-'hͿ-tja      a-'he-tse koreja'ri

         ‘one plate is lacking’(3552)   aky-'hͿ      e'ma-tja     a-'he-tse     koreja'ri
         two-NOM more-CSO          exist-NEG-DEC plate
         ‘we lack 3 plates’
672   8. Subordination and coordination8.3.2. Different subject medial clauses and switch referenceSection (8.3.1.) concerns same subject medial clauses. In (8.3.1.1.) the similar-
ity of subjects in the medial clause and the matrix clause was explicitly touched
upon. In the present section it will be shown that Kwaza deals with dissimilar-
ity of subjects in a grammaticalised manner which can be referred to as switch
reference. Kwaza has two formally distinct ways to indicate that the subject of
the cosubordinated verb is different from the subject of another cosubordinated
or a superordinated verb. The first way is by an extension of the same subject
medial clause verb with the element -dy- preceding the cosubordination
marker. This element indicates that the subject of the next verb is a different
third person than the third person subject of the verb to which it is currently
attached. The second way is a switch reference cosubordinate mood form in -si
which yields a different subject medial clause. This element is used when one
of the concomitant clauses in a cosubordination construction has a third person
subject while the other one has a non-third person subject. In the following ta-
ble the medial clause markers are categorised with regard to the coreference
possibilities of their subjects:Table 33. Medial clause markers and switch reference
                                  SS                             DS

SWR                                 -                            -si
8.3.2.1. Different subjects in cosubordination: -dy-The subject of a medial clause ending in -ta is usually identical with the subject
of the matrix clause. This is signalled clearly by overt person coreference
marking. In the case of a third person subject, there is zero cross-reference. If
necessary, it is possible to indicate morphologically via the element -dy- that
the third person of the medial clause is different from the third person of the
matrix clause. It must be mentioned that such an overt indication of different
subjects is not obligatory when the medial clause functions as an adverbial
clause. In the following example, the absence of a formal expression of differ-
ence between medial and matrix clause third person subjects does not lead to
ambiguity:(3553)    txu'hǊi-tja a'we-tse
          small-CSO rain-DEC
          ‘it rained a little’
                                           8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses      673This type of adverbial clause was discussed in (8.2.6. and 8.3.1.7.). Its behav-
iour with regard to subject (dis)continuity is a reason to consider this construc-
tion as subordinate rather than cosubordinate.
   In the subsequent examples the cosubordinated clauses do not function as
adverbials or complements of the matrix clauses. They are proper medial
clauses, but their third person subjects are identical to those of the matrix
clause:(3554)    ã'rǊi are-'nͿ-tja      o'ja-ki

          ‘João entered and gave the bag (POR bolsa) to Txi?a’In the case of different third person subjects the medial verb is first extended by
a different subject marker -dy- before the cosubordinative morpheme is at-
tached. Compare these examples with the preceding ones:(3559)    zjwãu o'nİ-hͿ-dy-ta             'peDro     ca'ri=asa-hͿ-ki

   ‘the women made him turn into a tapir, he went away, they went home’Apparently, the element -dy- signals a switch between the subject of the present
subordinate clause and the next one. My teacher MA explained it in the fol-
lowing manner: -dy- is a necessary element to “separate” the different agents in
one sentence, because without it “they get mixed up”.387
8.3.2.1.1. Different subject marking in other subordinate clausesDifferent subject marking may not be restricted to medial clauses alone. In
(8.2.2.1.) some concessive clauses were presented in which the morpheme -dy-
occurred:(3571)     y'ro-lete   'kui-ki       (3572)        y'ro-hͿ-dy-lete         'kui-ki

           ‘he drank (while) crying’               ‘while (letting) (the child) cry,
                                                   (the mother) drank (spirits)’One could regard the interpretation ‘letting the child cry’ as a reason to con-
sider -dy- as metaphorically extended use of the causative morpheme. Because
387.‘sem -dy- ele não divide, ele fica junto’. MA’s metalinguistic remarks often im-
    pressed me. They indicate that he would have been a great linguist had there been a
    chance for him to receive formal education. Obviously, opportunities for thorough
    education of native speakers is where the future lies for the study of Brazil’s indige-
    nous languages.
676   8. Subordination and coordinationits position after -hͿ-, however, it is more likely that -dy- is a different subject
morpheme here (the nominaliser -hͿ- may have a clefting function, see 5.5.20.).","[704, 705, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714]"

7.4.1. Verbal compoundsCompounding of verb roots is a very common and productive way to link up
events in Kwaza. Verbal inflexion is marked only on the last member of the
compound. Consider the following examples:(3035)    kuri=tsi'kja-da-ki          (3036)       kui='hay-da-ki
          stop=stand-1S-DEC                        drink=cut.off-1S-DEC
          ‘I stopped, and stayed put’              ‘I drank until half (the glass)’(3037)    konajã'dy=a-tsy-wy         ace'rjͿ-ki
          sweat=exist-POT-time       nigh-DEC
          ‘the hot rainy season is coming’ (lit. ‘the time of sweat is nigh’)
568   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresThe first member of a compound may be morphologically complex to some
extent:(3038)   kawİ      'kui-e=a-tsy-wy         ace'rjͿ-ki
         coffee drink-again=exist-POT-time nigh-DEC
         ‘coffee-time is arriving’(3039)   cari-'ty=asa-a-ni
         kill-DET=leave-1P-EXH
         ‘let’s kill him off!’ (t)(3040)   cari-'nã=asa-le-hͿ             tsoho'roi=oja-hͿ-lİ
         kill-FUT=leave-FRUST-NOM run=go-NOM-PREC
         ‘wanting to kill it, however, it got away, then’ (t)(3041)   nͿ-hͿ=txu'hǊi-tse
         big-NOM=small-DEC
         ‘it is somewhat big’ (but not very big)There are several different kinds of relationships between compounded roots.
This depends on the semantics of the concerned roots and on the relative order
of the concomitants of the compound structure. The compound may reflect a
sequence of events:(3042)   towİ=ca'we-ki
         break=go.down-DEC
         ‘he broke branch and fell down’(3043)   jere'xwa      wãwͿi=tu'ru-tja nwã'rã 'dai=warja-ta
         jaguar        sleep=wake-CSO cudgel take=bring-CSO
         ‘jaguar slept, woke up and took a wooden machete’ (t)The internal order of sequential compounds is iconic. Depending on the se-
mantics of the verb root, some orders are logically excluded:(3044)   terja=hy'ja=tse                    (3045)   *?hy'ja=te'rja-tse
         slide.down=fall-DEC                         fall=slide.down-DEC
         ‘he slipped and fell’                       ‘he fell and slipped’Nevertheless, the order can be reversed, in accordance with an alternative
course of events. This may lead to somewhat different lexicalised meanings. In
the following examples, the verb root buru- ‘to pass or visit a place which is
inhabited by people’ is combined with the verb root oja- ‘to go away, leave’, in
different orders:
                                                            7.4. Composition   569(3046)   ay-'rjͿ          oja=bu'ru-ki

         that-CD:area    pass=go-DEC
         ‘he passed by there’ (he did not stop)Serial compounds may have a purposive sense:(3048)   ja=Ǌi-a-'ni-tse
         eat=lie-1P-EXH-DEC
         ‘she says let’s eat so that we can go to sleep’(3049)   onİ='kui-da-mͿ
         come=drink-1S-VOL
         ‘I came to drink’, ‘I’m going there to drink’(3050)   awͿi='İ-ki                         (3051)   mã=audy'nİ̘-ki

         ‘he went there to see’                      ‘she called him back’Not all compounds are sequential, since some compounds refer to synchronic
events:(3052)   hy=te'rja-tse    (3053)         ywynwͿ-simjã'ku 'dy=asa-xa-xa-ki
         go=slide.down-DEC               tree-CL:stump       cut=leave-2-AS-DEC
         ‘he went down’                  ‘you’re cutting tree stumps away’(3054)   erewexy=hy'dwa-da-ki        (3055)       erewexy=hǊ'dwa-da-ki
         write=walk-1S-DEC                        write=sit-1S-DEC
         ‘I’m writing while walking’              ‘I’m writing sitting’Sometimes compounds may be regarded as consisting of a predicate and its
verbal complement:(3056)   'mİ̘-e-dy-ta      emã=hã'rã-tja
         beat-again-DS-CSO cry=stop-CSO
         ‘when he beat again, she just stopped crying’ (t)(3057)   areta=mã-'he-da-ki
         know=call-NEG-1S-DEC
         ‘I don’t know how to call it’
570   7. Other morphosyntactic structuresWhen one of the members of a compound is semantically attributive, it modi-
fies the other member, as if it were an adverb:(3058)   wai=txu'hǊi-tse
         good=small-DEC
         ‘it got a little better’(3059)   tyka?o=txu'hǊi-tara-mͿ
         visit.far=small-PROC-VOL
         ‘I’m going to visit far away people a little’(3060)   be='hİ-dy-'hͿ-ta-ki
         black=paint-CAU-NOM-1O-DEC
         ‘I’m painted black (with genipap) by someone’   Several verb roots with a relatively abstract meaning occur so frequently as
a second element in a verbal compound that they are like suffixes. The root
kwİ- ‘to enter’ was illustrated in (5.3.1.) to function often in the same way as a
directional morpheme. Note the following “illative” compound:(3061)   towİ='kwİ-tja
         go=enter-CSO
         ‘they went into (the forest, house, corral etc.)’ (t)The verb root asa- ‘to end, leave behind, separate from’ is usually a second
element in a compound verb and adds a terminative meaning ‘into bits, into
oblivion, away’:(3062)   do'te=asa-hͿ-ki                (3063)    ha'dai=asa-xa-tsy-tse
         shed=leave-NOM-DEC                       hack.up=leave-2-POT-DEC
         ‘leak empty’                             ‘you should cut it to bits
                                                  (when you run into a jaguar)’
(3064)   ywy'nwͿ       'dy=asa-wa-ki
         tree          cut=leave-IS-DEC
         ‘they cut the log in order to clear it out of the way’As mentioned in (5.4.10.), asa- has a singular object. Its plural equivalent uja-
is also usually compounded:(3065)   ywy'nwͿ       'dy=uja-wa-ki
         tree          cut=leave-IS-DEC
         ‘they cut the many logs in order to clear them out of the way’Similarly, the verb root bwa- ‘to end, finish’ adds a completive meaning as a
second member in a compound:
                                                           7.4. Composition   571(3066)   'boi-dy=bwa-dy-'ra            (3067)    ba='bwa-cwa-ki
         full-CAU=end-CAU-IMP                    cut=finish-IS-DEC
         ‘fill it up for him!’                   ‘they finished clearing a field’Also the verb hãrã- ‘to stop’, as in (3056), is used as a second element with an
aspectual meaning. This was also discussed in (5.5.23.).
   The benefactive function of the verb root wady- ‘to give’ as a second mem-
ber of a compound was discussed in section (5.4.4.). Here, a few examples will
suffice:(3068)   ui         kurje=wa'dy-nƭnã-da-ki       (3069)    kwe=wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-ra
         tobacco wind=give-2O-1S-DEC                       string=give-1SO-IMP
         ‘I rolled a cigarette for you’                    ‘string it for me!’(3070)   lonã-'na      hy=kwİ=wa'dy-da-ki
         hole-LOC go=enter=give-1S-DEC
         ‘I entered into the hole for him’Some compound constructions, like those involving wady- ‘give’, are like se-
rial verbs: they contain several verbs, but they refer to a single event. The fol-
lowing examples contain constructions which also seem to represent “serial
compounds”:(3071)   i'tsosisi 'dy=wanİ-ra             (3072)    were=oja-'tay-nahere
         cord      cut=bring-IMP                     revolt=go-CL:woman-COL
         ‘bring me a piece of rope!’                 ‘the runaway women’(3073)   tswa tso'roi=oja-ta kwİ-da'mͿ-tse
         man run=go-CSO        enter-want-DEC
         ‘the man ran towards the cavern’Compounds involving the verb root wanİ- ‘bring’ may have a similar function
as with wady- ‘give’, but not as regular and as abstract. They should probably
not be regarded as serial compounds:(3074)   e-si'ki      'dy=wanİ-ra (3075)         coha-si'ki      'dai=wanİ-ra
         Ø-CL:skin cut=bring-IMP                 foot-CL:skin    take=bring-IMP
         ‘cut and give me a piece of cloth!’     ‘pick up and bring the shoes!’   Compounded structures may consist of more than two verb roots. The fol-
lowing examples contain triple and quadruple compounds:(3076)   ywy'nwͿ        dury=oce=cwͿ'te-da-ki
         tree           roll=throw=off.path-1S-DEC

           ‘then he shot it down and tore it to bits, that’s how it went328‘ (t)  Compounding may be recursive in that the same verb root is repeated in one

           leak-CD:area=leak-empty=all-CD:area-1S-DEC table-LOC
           ‘I spilt water all over the table’Some types of root repetition should be considered as reduplication, which
should probably not be confused with compounding (see also the relevant re-
mark in 7.3.5.):(3081)     'tei-hͿ-kai        aru=a'ru-tse
           one-NOM-CL:leg jump=jump-DEC
           ‘he hops on one leg’  Some verbal compounds are lexicalised. The combination of the productive
meanings of the concomitant roots leads to a less predictable meaning:(3082)     i'si=Ǌi-da-hͿ-ki                 (3083)     tsã=txi'te-da-ki

tigo. Some roots, such as dai- ‘to rise’ occur exclusively in (lexicalised) com-

          batrise=leave-DEC       hole-LOC
          ‘the bat flew out of the hole’The use of the verb root kukui- ‘to hurt’ as an expletive particle (see 7.7.6.)
may derive from a compound, but this cannot be verified.(3086)    ku'kui nͿ-'hͿ-re

7.4.2. Other compoundsNominal compounds are rare in Kwaza, and they are usually rather lexicalised.
Consider the following examples:(3087)    ãrǊi=eke-'e    'eke e-'he-tsy-hͿ

          ‘cow without horns’(3088)    kari=tsu'ty

          ‘bark of mahogany’                            ‘branch’If (3092) should be a compound, it would have involved the independent form
of the word for ‘arm’, tsoro. However *ywynwͿtsoro is ungrammatical. The
same holds for example (3091), where the complete form of the second mem-
ber of the compound would have been esi'ki ‘skin’.329329.One could argue that classifiers are allomorphs which apply when nouns are com-
574     7. Other morphosyntactic structures    There are also compounds of which the members belong to different catego-
ries. Notice the following compounds in which the first member is a noun, but
the second member is a semantically attributive verb root without verbal in-
flexion.(3093)      atxitxi=da'ra                             (3094)      jerexwa=txu'hǊi
            maize=green                                           jaguar=small

member is an adverb:(3095)      da'rje-hͿ      a-'he=danͿ-a-wy
            strong-NOM     have-NEG=still-1P-time

            see=Ø-DR:upward-1S-DEC
            ‘I looked high up there’Just like nominal compounds, these are rare, since the adverbial content would
normally be expressed by a separate preceding adverb, or by a directional mor-
pheme (see 5.3.). Nevertheless, this yields a slightly different meaning:(3098)      ãwͿi-to'to-da-ki
            see-DR:upward-1S-DEC
            ‘I looked upwards’Compounds involving adverbs (or functioning as such) were discussed more
extensively towards the end of section (6.2.3.) of the chapter on adverbs.
   On one occasion, a bound morpheme occurred in a root position, com-
pounded with a pronoun as second member:
      pounded or incorporated. However, it has been demonstrated in section (4.2.) that
      not all nouns are etymologically related to their classifiers and that not all classifiers
      are represented by full nouns. Unless one would consider those etymologically un-
      related classifiers as suppletive forms, the Kwaza classifiers should not be regarded
      as compounded or incorporated forms.

7.5.   Morphological ellipsisOne of the basic characteristics of morphology is that it involves bound mor-
phemes. One of the basic properties of bound morphemes is that they do not
occur as independent words. This is confirmed by the fact that when a bound
morpheme of a certain language is presented in isolation to a bilingual native
speaker, it is very difficult for him or her to give an accurate translation if he or
she is not a linguist.330 In the present work I have analysed Kwaza as a mor-
phologically complex language, and its morphology as agglutinative. Morpho-
phonological processes are rare in Kwaza, and quite irregular. Although the
morphology seems agglutinating, the large number of grammatical morphemes
with lexical contents betrays a tendency towards polysynthesis. Notwithstand-
ing this analysis, it can be demonstrated that bound morphemes in Kwaza do
occur independently, be it only in the proper contexts. Furthermore, a number
of morphemes can be interpreted in isolation by some consultants, although the
interpretations of such morphemes may vary strongly, depending on the imag-
ined or suggested context in which they are placed. In van der Voort (2002a) I
have argued that this does not prohibit one to regard Kwaza roots and inflex-
ions as bound morphemes.331
    In this section I will discuss elliptic phenomena in Kwaza morphology. I
will not treat here the omission of overt arguments of fully inflected verbs. This
has already been dealt with in section (5.1.) on person cross-reference. Fur-
thermore, I will not discuss here the omission of overt heads of attributive con-
structions. This is mentioned in sections (4.2.1.3.), (4.3.) and (8.4.1.2.). Finally,
stylistically motivated omission of sentence constituents is not discussed in the
present work at all.
    The subject to which I refer as “ellipsis” in the present work is mainly the
omission of verbal inflexion and of roots. It occurs often in pragmatic contexts
where it is obvious to the hearer which elements are to be understood. Certain
aspects of Kwaza grammar, such as the resumptive function of independently
occurring inflexional elements must have originated from ellipsis. In the pres-
ent section I will give an overview of morphological ellipsis in Kwaza. Several
specific aspects of ellipsis were also touched upon in other places, which will
be mentioned in passing. Negation in elliptic constructions has already been
discussed separately in (7.1.1.5.). Coordination by means of an elliptic con330.Obviously, this is no less difficult for a linguist who is not a native speaker.
331.In that article I have drawn a parallel with the Eskimo languages on the basis Allen
    (1996:15;27;253). Root ellipsis and morpheme ellipsis in Inuktitut is also the topic of
    an article by Swift and Allen (2002) that came to my attention afterwards.
576    7. Other morphosyntactic structuresstruction is described in (8.5.). Few elliptic phenomena have been observed
with respect to nominal morphology. This is probably because nominal inflex-
ion in Kwaza is relatively simple in the first place.
    In subsection (7.5.1.) I will discuss the independent occurrence of verbal
roots and the omission of verbal inflexion, i.e. of person and mood markers.
Subsection (7.5.2.) concerns the independent occurrence of person and mood
markers and the omission of verbal roots. In (7.5.3.) I will treat ellipsis in
nominal morphology. In subsection (7.5.4.) it will be demonstrated how verbal
inflexional morphemes can be separated from the verb root to which they be-
long by intervening sentence constituents.","[605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614]"

7.2.7. Expletive -rai- ‘damned!’The morpheme -rai ‘damned!’ has basically an exclamative function. Although
it can be used in a neutral way, it has usually a heavily expletive connotation.
However, this often occurs in an ironic context of faking indignation. The mor
548   7. Other morphosyntactic structurespheme is mostly applied to verb stems, between the person cross-reference and
mood markers:(2916)   ãwãka-da-'rai-re

         laugh-1S-damn-INT
         ‘I’m not joking!’-rai occurs very often in emphatically used interrogative clauses (see 5.2.2.1.).
Also the negative morpheme -he- may be involved, but without a negative
sense:(2922)   kui-he-rai-'re
         drink-NEG-damn-INT
         ‘didn’t he drink!, Jesus!’(2923)   'kui=jã-he-rai-re
         drink=be-NEG-damn-INT
         ‘well then, why don’t you drink if you want it so much!’
                                    7.2. Morphemes not limited to word class      549However, when negative -he- is absent the emphatic expletive construction
may have a negative sense:(2924)   kui-rydy-'hͿ-rai-re
         drink-IRR-NOM-damn-INT
         ‘he isn’t going to drink, no way!’(2925)   atsile-rydy-'hͿ-rai-re

         hurt-CAU-1S-damn-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
         ‘it doesn’t hurt, no!’ (speaker does not want to admit he has pain)The expletive morpheme sometimes replaces the mood marker, as in the sec-
ond alternative answer to (2920), and it does not have to be very impolite. The
following examples represent possible answers to a compliment by someone
about the tasteful soup the speaker has made:(2927)   'wai-he-'ki                       (2928)      'wai-he-'rai
         good-NEG-DEC                                  good-NEG-damn
         ‘it does not taste good’                      ‘it does not taste good’In fact, (2928) was considered as more polite than the countersuppositional ex-
ample (2927).
    The following examples represent a fixed type of emphatic expression, in
which -rai replaces a mood marker, and in which the root wai- occurs in the
cosubordinative mood:(2929)   awy-'rjͿ-rai            wai-'ta         (*waiki)
         cold-CD:area-damn       good-CSO
         ‘it’s freezing!’(2930)   kara'ri-da-rai wai-'ta
         thirst-1S-damn good-CSO
         ‘I’m so thirsty!’It is not known whether one of the constituents is subordinated to the other.
    In the example (2865), -rai is attached to a noun. In the next example, the
derived noun is zero-verbalised:(2931)   'ñǊ-rai-re
         faeces-damn-INT
         ‘it isn’t dung, pal!’ (hearer was afraid to taste liquorice)
550   7. Other morphosyntactic structures   Section (7.2.1.) contains several examples in which -rai is combined with
the paucal morpheme -ry- in the following manner:(2932)   kuraku'ra-ry-'rai
         chicken-PAU-damn
         ‘those/my/your/his chicken’In this combination, -rai does not seem to have a strong expletive connotation.
However, it does seem that there can be a context dependent possessive con-
notation. That possessive relation can be made explicit, as in the next example:(2933)   'xyi-dy-hͿ    tala-ry-'rai
         you-POS-NOM uncle-PAU-damn
         ‘your uncles’    The morpheme -rai may be etymologically related to the verb root rai'hͿ-
‘to ruin’, and/or to the root of nouns such as 'rai?ͿhͿ ‘animal, thing’, 'rai?ͿnǊ
‘poison’.","[585, 586, 587, 588]"
