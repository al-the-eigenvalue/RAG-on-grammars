         The normal way of forming a negative in MT is by inse r t i ng the negat i ve
particle kalu (wu ) ( TT : karluwu ) . Thi s form ( an Iwa idj a loan) i s used more
often than the form anuka ( f rom the trad i tional form arnuka ) , though this
l a t t e r is used by some . Whe re the negat ive occurs with an inflected
independent verb or a verbal complex there i s generally no subj unct i ve or

"       S lobin ( 1 9 7 7 ) looks a t the cognit ive and communi cat ive dete rminants of the
nature of language and how the se apply in relat i on to language change ,
comparing the change apparent in language acqui s i t i on , historical change and
change in contact s i tua tions . He presents four basic 'ground rule s ' to which a
communicative system must adhere i f it is to func t ion as a 'full-f ledged human
language ' ( S lobin 1 9 7 7 : 1 8 6 ) . These f our ' charge s ' are :
        ( i ) Be clear ( s ta ted previously as one of Slobin's ope rating principles of
chi ld language : 'Underlying semantic relations should be marked ove r t l y and
clearly' ( Slobin 1 9 7 3 » .
        ( i i ) Be humanly proce s sible in ongoing time , meaning that ' language must
conform to s t rategie s of speech percept ion and production' ( Slobin 1 9 7 7 : 1 86 ) .
        ( ii i ) Be quick and easy , relating to the human propens i ty to ' cut corne r s
( 197 7 : 187 ) .
        ( iv ) Be expres s ive , in�luding two important aspect s : seman t i c and
rhe t orical . A fully expres sive language needs to be able to encode a wide
range of seman t i c no t i ons and must also be able to be used for more than j us t
conveying l ogical propo s i t i ons and referential informat ion.        It needs t o
provide speakers w i t h means of engaging a he are r ' s attention , of conveying

6. 9     SUBORDIIIArE CLAUSES        In TT , clauses may be j oined together or embedded within each othe r ,
forming more complex sentences .             There are a numbe r o f cases o f subordinate
clause s in TT expres sing d i f ferent re lationships . The subordina t ing s t rategy
used in Tiwi i s that of a subordinat ing conj unc t ion and a clause with a f ini te
ve rb . Glass has found tha t this seems to be the mos t common s t rategy in
Aus t ral ian prefixing languages (Glass 1 980 : 8 ) . The bas i c subordinate
conj unc t i ons i n TT are karri 'when' , expre s s ing a temporal relationship ( 6 . 9 . 3 ,
p . 29 9 ) , pili 'be caus e ' express ing reason ( 6 . 9 . 5 , p . 30 l ) , pili ngini ' in order

6.4   S'l'ATIVE VEKBAL CLAUSE5        S ta t ive ve rbal clauses are d i s t inguished from active clause s mainly on the
bas i s of the type of predicate . The predicate in s tative verbal clauses
cons i s t s of a complement preceding an inf lected ve rb . The complement may be
man i f e s t e d by such things as NPs , predicatives , and locat ive or manner words or
phrases .        The verb is a verb of ' be ing' or 'becoming , . 35          The se s t a t ive ve rbal clause s could be included with the active verbal
clauses and .the complement plus verb treated as a type of verbal complex
( d e s c ribed in 4 . 3 , p . 20 3 ) . Just as equally , the s t a tive verbal clauses could
                                                                                                   283
be grouped toge the r with the non-ve rbal c lause s , s ince t he same types of
complement s occur as the predicate in non-ve rbal claus e s and the same sort of
relati onships are expre s s ed in the s e clauses as a re expressed in the s t a t ive
non-ve rbal clauses . Because of this di lemma as to where the se claus e s f i t , and
for ease of d e s c ript ion , this type of clause i s d i s cussed separa t e l y , though
the re may appe ar to be l i t t l e d i f fe rence between some of the examp les in thi s
type and s ome of the a c t ive verbal clauses .","[290, 291]"

1 980 : 4 1 ) , 2 but , in gene ral , are not argument s of the ve rb and , in the case of
TT , are not usua l l y marked on the ver b . These lateral cons t i tuents are
bas i c a l ly the same for TT and MT , though the mani f e s tation of them may d i ff e r .
The se cons t i tuents are : locat ive ( Loc ) , temporal ( T ) , manner ( Mnr ) , modal
(Mdl ) , negat i ve ( Neg ) and reason ( Reas ) . 3 Locat i ve may be cons idered an

6. 2 . 3 . 1   LOCATIVE          In a l l var i e t i e s of Tiwi the locat ive may occur in all type s of acti ve
verbal clause s .          It may a l so occur in s t a t ive c lauses ( both verbal and
non-ve rbal ) but as the complement in the predicate of the clause ( see 6 . 4 ,
p . 28 2 , and 6 . 5 , p . 28 5 ) . The locative cons t i tuent of a c lause may be mani f e s ted
by a loca tive word ( see 3 . 5 . 1 , p . I 24 ) ; by a locat ive noun , ind i c a t ing a place
o r the name of a place , such as tingata 'beach ' ; by a locat ive phrase ( s ee
5 . 2 . 1 , p . 23 6 ) , an appos i t ional locative phrase ( see 5 . 2 , p . 2 3 5 ) or by a
locat ive clause ( see 6 . 9 . 2 , p . 298 )( 1 ) Trad i t i onal Tiwi         The locat ive cons t i tuent may indicate mot i on ' t o ' or ' f rom' with the verbs
o f mo t i on and locat ion ' at ' , ' in ' , 'on ' , 'ne a r ' e t c . with non-motion verbs .
There are no formal difference s between the s e diffe rent types of locat ion .
Loc a t i on ' a t ' may be marked j us t by the verbal loca tive prefix (wu )ni - , ' a t a
d i s t ance ' or by the verbal s t ance prefix Ci (ngi ) - 'out bush' ( see 4 . 2 . 4 ,
p . I 8 2 ) . There may be a locat ive expre ssed exte rnally to the ve rb a s we l l as
thes e verbal prefixe s . These pref ixe s are used only with the se sense s and are
not used t o s ignal a general locative ( cf . the use of the concomi tative marker
to s i gnal a concomi tat ive 6 . 2 . 1 . 2 ( 2 ) , p . 2 5 2 ) . With mot ion verbs the pref i x
(wu )ni - may a l s o b e used to mean ' t o he re ' . In this case there may be an

English before a voiced consonant e . g . MT: [pE: L k l ' bag ' .",[62]

when a verbal o r s t a t ive incorporated f o rm occurs in the nucleus s t ructure of
the verb ( see 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 2 ) , p . 1 60 ) . Howeve r , the se can be regarded as adding a
dimension of meaning to the verb or clause .                  In mos t cases they a re similar to

6. 4 . 1       STAnVE VERBAL CLAUSES Ilf 'l'T          In TT , the verb s tems in this type of clause are -mi ' be ' , -ma ' be ' ,
'be come ' and - muwu or -miringarra ' l i ve , . 3 6 The complement may con s i s t of a NP
(an extended noun phrase or an adj e c t ive or noun al one , see 5 . 1 , p . 2 2 1 f ) , a
predicative ( 3 . 4 , p . 1 2 2 ) , a manner phrase ( see 5 . 2 . 3 , p . 24 1 ) , a manner word
( 3 . 5 . 3 , p . 1 3 5 ) , a l ocat ive word ( 3 . 5 . 1 , p . 1 24 ) or a locative phrase ( 5 . 2 . 1 ,

"     Although the concomi t a t ive marker i s not included i n the nucleus s t ructure
in Table 4 . 3 , a dis cus sion of it i s relevant at this point . It behaves like a
class 1 incorporated form in that it takes the connec t ive
following certain morphemes ( see p . 1 58 ) .

     The main purpose o f the concomi t a t ive marker would seem to be to indicate
the presence of anothe r nominal argument in the deep s t ructure of the clause ,
one that i s not norma l l y i mplied by the semant i cs of the ve rb . The
concomit a t ive marker is used in two ways :        ( i ) 'Accompaniment . ' In the se case s , whe re the nominal argument implied i s
in close associat ion w i t h one of the parti cipants normal l y in a sense of
' accompaniment ' , the forms of the concomi t a t ive marker a re :              ma-

2 verb stems and incorporated forms , with the variable consonant of the class 2
stem or form being
the final   i           j,       marri-
                               and        preceding c l a s s 1 and 3 s tems or f orms , with
                    be ing dropped before class 3 s tems and forms (a regular
morphophonemic process - see 2 . 8 , p . 7 1 ) . The nominal a rgument to which the
concomi t a t ive marker makes refe rence may occur as an inco rporated form ( see ( 2 )
( v ) , p . 1 63 ) , or as an overt nominal phrase in the clause , or bo th . 2 1 There are
s ome cases whe re the concomi tat ive marker has no over t refe rent , e i ther in the
