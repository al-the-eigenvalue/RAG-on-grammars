"               Control structures and SVCs differ significantly in a fourth way. Control structures allow independent            negation. as any biclausal structure does (271). SVCs by contrast, function as monoclausal structures in            that they do not allow independent negation (272). Only the first verb can be modified by a negative            morpheme. as in 273, and that morpheme implies the negation of the whole string.",[114]

"               4.3.4.   Summary     and Implications.       In this section I have shown that Kadiwéu lacks prepositions           entirely. I have shown that the structures analyzed by Griffiths as containing prepositional phrases are           actually biclausal. The fact that adverbs can modify either of the lexical heads comprising those structures           indicates that we are dealing with two verbs rather than with a verb and a preposition.            Moreover.           relativization also indicates that we are dealing with biclausal structures. The structures discussed in this           paper have many of the properties attributted to SVCs across languages: arguments must be shared, the           negation of one head implies the negation of the whole string. and the actions expressed by serial verbs           are simultaneous.",[117]

                This disscrtation has also shown that Kadiwéu         lacks prepositions entirely. and that the structures            analyzed by Griffiths as containing prepositional phrases are actually biclausal. The fact that adverbs can            modify either of the lexical heads comprising those structures indicates that we are dealing with two verbs            rather than with a verb and a preposition. Moreover, relativization also indicates that we are dealing with            biclausal structures. The structures discussed in this paper have many of the properties attributed to SVCs            across languages: arguments must be shared, the negation of one head implies the negation of the whole            string, and the actions expressed by serial verbs are simultaneous. Further fieldwork will be necessary to            test whether pronominals can also be considered arguments in SVCs.               In any case, this dissertation            suggests that the patterns of SVCs still need to be sorted out in theoretical linguistics.","[138, 139]"

"                 Note in examples 236-239 that the second element taking an internal argument has been translated             into English as a preposition.     One might argue that Kadiwéu does not have two verbs in the sentences             above, but a verb and a preposition.      Indeed. Griffiths 1991 analyzes examples 237-239 as containing             prepositional phrases, rather than verbs with ""preposition-like properties”. However, the fact that a word             can be translated as a preposition does not mean that that word is a preposition. The first problem that we             face in analyzing roots like -ati, ka-. and d:i- as prepositions is that we will have to postulate that             Kadiwéu has homophonous verbs and prepositions, because 240 and 241 show that such roots can            function as main verbs.    Example 240 differs from example 236 in that 240 has a main and a subordinate             clause, as indicated by the presence of the complementizer me.",[105]

"               Parameters place limits on the ways in which languages may differ, thereby reducing the number of           grammatical hypotheses a child might consider in the course of language acquisition. Thus. the hypothesis           developed in this chapter has implications for language acquisition. According to Radford (1990:199).           ""the earliest grammars developed by young children are purely lexical in nature"". That is, according to           Radford. child language is purely a projection of lexical categories. If this is true. we might expect           children to first assume that there are no pronominal argument languages. A question for further research           concerns the extent to which the grammatical development of children acquiring Kadiwéu is parallel to           that of children acquiring (for instance) European languages.",[137]

              In order to translate sentence like Mary killed a chicken not with a knife. one must modify the verb -ati           with a valency suffix (see 4.4 for a discussion of valency markers) and thus create a subordinate clause:

             If we were dealing with control clauses. we could not explain why each clause cannot have independent           negation.   However, it is a characteristic of SVCs that the negation of one verb implies in the negation of           the whole string (Sebba 1987).","[114, 115]"
"              4.4.1. Valency. The term valency is derived from chemistry and is often used in linguistics to refer          to the number and type of bonds which the verb may form with a number of dependent elements referred          to as arguments (Crystal     1985). This definition, however, is ambiguous, because transitivity can be          defined in the same way. In this work, I use valency to refer exclusively to the syntactically relevant          components of meaning specified in the Lexicon of a language.",[119]
"              Griffiths   1987 and Griffiths      1991   are descriptions of Kadiwéu   relative clauses and wuinterrogatives.        respectively, including a discussion of constituent order and constituent movement. The author points out that the        constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses varies freely between VSO and SVO, while the constituent order of        subordinate clauses is always VSO. My data shows that the constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses is much        freer than Griffiths reports. Possible orders are OVS, VOS, SOV. OSV, VSO, and SVO. The high frequency of        SVO order in Griffiths’ publications seems to be biased by elicitation technique: I have found that Kadiwéu        speakers tend to translate Portuguese sentences with SVO order. The problem is that, although one can translate        Portuguese sentences word-by-word         into Kadiwéu,    the resulting set of Kadiwéu     sentences      reflects a small        proportion of the constituent order of Kadiwéu,         which has much     freer order. Griffiths never mentions that        (semantic) case is morphologically marked in Kadiwéu, and free constituent order is not unusual among languages        which mark case morphologically.",[16]
"
           The complement of copular clauses in Kadiwéu is always a noun phrase. Kadiwéu does not have adjectives: all       non-verbal roots have identical syntactic properties. Elements which are expressed by adjectives in languages like       English are expressed by nouns (168-169) or intransitive verbs (170-171)            in Kadiwéu (see 4.4 for criteria for       lexical category classification).

"               If lexical categories do not project in pronominal argument languages. what is the clausal structures of           these languages? Chomsky    1995 proposes that functional heads vary across languages in that they calty           strong features in some languages and weak features in others. Since strong features must be discharged.           functional categories carrying strong features trigger movement. Thus. according to this proposal. English           differs from languages without (overt) wH-movement         in that complementizers   carry strong features in           English, and therefore they trigger movement. Chomsky 1995 proposes that transitivizing morphemes are           functional categories that function as light verbs. Jelinek 1995 assumes this analysis and proposes that           transitivizing morphemes are functional heads that carry strong features in some languages, triggering           verb movement. I adopt this proposal and assume that the Kadiwéu semantic role markers, represented in           319 as 8, are functional categories which must discharge their strong features and therefore trigger           movement:

               On this hypothesis. the Kadiwéu semantic role suffixes are like light verbs. Grimshaw & Mester (1988)           argue that light verbs are functional categories that must be in a symbiotic                      relationship with lexical           categories that are valent but unable to assign theta-roles to complements. Whereas the verb is valent but           unable to assign theta-roles. a light verb is avalent but able to assign theta-roles: that is. able to license           grammatical arguments. Working on the Minimalism framework. I propose that a valent stem is attracted           to adjoin 9, the light verb. As a result theta-assigning takes place. This proposal explains why D nodes           function as arguments. Theta-roles are discharged at the SPEC position of © to D nodes: there is no other           nominal element in the structure. Note in 319 that the order of the Kadiwéu morphemes is captured by           this proposal.””              4.4.4. Summary             and Implications.            In this section I proposed that lexical categories are divided in           the Kadiwéu lexicon into valent and avalent roots. and I believe that this provides enough evidence to          classify them as either verbs or nouns. Although Kadiwéu has valent roots. it has no transitive roots.","[135, 136]"

               I assume that a lexical representation of a verb must encode a representation of the element of meaning           that sets the state or event expressed by that verb (represented here simply as STATE and LOCATION)           and a set of primitives predicates that represent syntactic generalizations of the meaning of a verb (I will           use the predicates cause and become         to represent these primitive predicates). A LCS encodes also           information about the semantic participants of an event which can be filled or satisfied in syntax: external           argument, represented as the subject of cause (x); internal direct argument. represented as the subject of           become (y): and indirect external argument. represented as z.","[119, 120]"
"                   Questions regarding categorical distinctions have occupied a central place in linguistics. Chomsky           (1986b and later works)           makes     a distinction between      lexical categories. which are defined over the           features [+/-noun, +/-verb], and functional categories, which include the following grammatical elements:           complementizer, determiner, tense, and light verbs. According to Chomsky, cross-linguistic differences           are not random. but they are confined to a specific component of grammar. The parametric variation           across languages lies in inflectional categories rather than in lexical categories. Therefore, the proposal           that Salishan languages lack a lexical contrast between nouns and verbs is incompatible with Chomsky's           proposal.",[118]

           spokenby about 1,500 Indians distributed over
                                                      an area of 538,000 hectares in the State of Mato Grosso do
           Sul, Brazil. The Kadiwéus are the only surviving descendants of the Mbayd people, who
                                                                                               in the 18th.
           century dominated a large extension of the Brazilian and Paraguayan Chaco area. The data for this study
           is comprised primarily of material collected in fieldwork with native speakers of Kadiwéu in Serra da
           Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
               I provide a detailed description of Kadiwéu phonology and morphology. | offer a description of the
           Kadiwéu phonology, on synchronic and diachronic grounds, taking dialect differences into consideration.
           Kadiwéu      has two dialects which reflect gender and social status. Moreover,                 I provide a detailed
           description of the verb and noun morphology. The verb is marked for subject and object in person and
           number.     Kadiwéu    marks subject person with          prefixes, but number (pl)      is marked     with a suffix
           immediately following
                            the root. Aspect
                                         and mood, but not tense, are markedon the verb. There are seven
           aspect markers - completive/incompletive/durative, telic/atelic, repetitive, and intensive - and two mood
           markers, conditional and desiderative.          There are also three negation markers and a set of directional
           enclitics. Among      the WaikurGan languages, only Kadiwéu has a set of semantic role markers. The
           structure of the Kadiwéu noun resembles noun structure in other Waikunian languages as well as in most
           westem      South   American   languages.       The   presence   of classifiers/nominalizers    marking   inalienable
           possession seems to be an areal feature of the languages of western lowland South America.
               Several aspects of the Kadiwés syntax, which bear on theoretical issues, are discussed. Kadiwéu has
           the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: any nominal phrase can be omitted, nominal
           phrases are freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb,              and some discontinuous nominal
           expressions
                 are allowed.             Jelinek   1984    explains the properties of nonconfigurational
                                                                                                  languages by
          proposing that languages set the elements which can be verbal arguments.                        According to Jelinek,
           pronominal clitics and affixes are the arguments in nonconfigurational languages;
                                                                                      nominal phrases are
           adjuncts and therefore they can assume free order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally
           accepted, however. For instance, Baker 1994 argues that nominat phrases are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he
           denies that pronominals are arguments in this language. According to Baker, the arguments are an empty
           category pro that occupies the projections of the verb. Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting Jelinek’'s

            hypothesis that pronominals can indeed be arguments in some languages. First, pronominal clitics and
            affixes co-occur with elements which are roughly tike English prepositions in that they assign semantic
            roles: -d: 'theme', -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ‘benefactive’, -g ‘goal’, -/okom '‘adessive', -k '‘allative’.
            Nouns can never co-occur with such semantic role assigners. The fact that bound pronominals, rather than
            nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that Kadiwéu is a pronominal argument language
            of the Jelinek rather than the Baker type. In addition, the results of several syntactic tests support the
            analysis —    passivization,   recursivity, coreference,   anaphora,   quantifiers, and the behavior     of wu-
            interrogatives ~- support the analysis.
                This dissertation also shows that the major lexical categories present in Kadiwéu are nouns and verbs.
            Kadiwéu lacks prepositions entirely. I show that structures previously analyzed as containing prepositional
            phrases are in fact serial verb constructions.
                 Finally, I present the criteria I used to classify the Kadiwéu roots as nouns or verbs. Verbs are those
            elements which are valent; that is, that have an argument structure. Valency representation contains
            information about the number of arguments a verb requires
                                                                and the semantic nature
                                                                                    of those arguments. I
           determine the valency of a Kadiwéu root according to (i) the meaning of a bare root and (ii) the meaning
            of a stem consisting of the reot plus a valency suffix. Although Kadiwéu has valent roots, it has no
            transitive roots.   I understand transitivity as the capacity of assigning theta-roles to complements.
            Transitivity is assigned syntactically via verb movement. This dissertation has implications for language
           typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers’ 1994 prediction that transitivity is assigned at the
            syntactic level in all languages whose arguments are pronominals, rather than nominal phrases or an
            empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. | propose a parametric variation based on an insight in Fukui &
            Speas 1986 to account for pronominal argument languages. I argue that in these languages verbs do not
            project. On this hypothesis, clauses in pronominal argument languages are formed by raising of a valent
            lexical item to adjoin a light verb, which is a functional category able to theta-assign.","[4, 5, 6, 7]"

               First. consider adverbial modification. The adjunction of certain adverbs to biclausal structures leads to            ambiguous interpretations, since the adverb can be interpreted as being associated with either the main or            the subordinate verb (Shibatani       1976). Thus,    for instance, in Kadiwéu,   as in English,    in one of the            interpretations of the biclausal structure in 242 silently modifies the verb make and the sentence means            that John was silent when he made Mary come into the room. In the other interpretation the adverb            modifies come and the sentence means that Mary came into the room silently.”","[105, 106]"
"           This is because all the proper names used in the body of this dissertation come from Portuguese and the           pronounciation of this words varies from speaker to speaker according to their knowledge of Portuguese.

                   In order to license grammatical internal arguments (i.e. transitive. ditransitive. and unaccusative           clauses), we must add role suffixes. Example 308 and 309 show that a stem functions as a noun or a           transitive verb depending on whether the semantic role markers are present or not.       In 308 they are not           present and the stems function as a noun: that is, syntactic arguments cannot be added in spite of the fact           that the valency suffix -Gen: '[+become]' is present and in spite of the fact that a Kadiwéu speaker           understands that somebody is pierced. In 309, however. the semantic role -d: ‘theme’ is present and the           stems functions as a transitive clause; that is. there is a grammatical internal argument, Go-'Ipl.OBJ':           (308)       lapwaGen:ig:i.

"       There is only one form for the plural demonstrative, id:iwa. The plural marker -wa can also be used to mean       ‘Kadiwéu nationality’ or ‘pertaining to the Kadiwéus' (e.g. ad:iwa iwal:o ‘that Kadiwéu woman sitting’ vs. ad:i       iwal:o ‘that woman sitting’).

"                Pronominal argument languages have neither quantifiers nor wi-words that can occupy argument          positions. These typological features constitute important evidence for the nature of argument structure in          these languages.           Quantifiers and wu-complements       appear as affixes added to locative predicates in          Kadiwéu. Table 13 shows the Kadiweéu locative roots.

When            an adjoined nominal phrase receives an indefinite interpretation. the clitic is treated as a variable and the            sentence is ruled out as an instance of vacuous quantification. Since, according to my hypothesis. every            nominal phrase is in an adjoined position, it follows that bare quantifier nominal phrases must be            impossible in Kadiwéu. Quantificational notions appear as suffixes added to locative predicates as in 229            and 230. Example        231     shows   that the Kadiwéu          quantifier suffixes   have unselective scope.   Such            constructions are similar to the ones described in Jelinek & Demers 1994 for Straits Salish.","[99, 100]"

           Auxiliary verbs must also be inflected for person and number. They have. however, a different inflectional       pattern. Example 100 illustrates the inflectional pattern of auxiliary verbs. Observe that auxiliary verb inflection       involves suppletion.      ( 100 )     -go = ‘go’
                  ejigo I go’
                  igo    ‘He goes’
                  eniGa   'We go'
                  emi     ‘You (sg/pl) go’           Although -me-n ‘say’ is not an auxiliary verb, it also has an irregular inflection. The verb -me:n triggers the      metathesis of person markers:

The direction        of the action is expressed by means of a prefix and a set of derivational enclitics. Another set of derivational        enclitics, which must precede the directional clitics. can be used to create motion verbs. [ classify these morphemes        as derivational because they can change the meaning of the verbal stem (note the meaning shift in 108). Like any        other enclitic in Kadiwéu, they trigger deletion of sonorant consonants. Table 8 presents the motion and direction        enclitics and prefix and 102-112 present some examples.","[62, 63]"

One possible answer            that can be found within Government & Binding theory is that case licenses the presence of grammatical            arguments. Thus, the function of those morphemes could be assignment of structural case. But Kadiwéu            presents evidence against this interpretation.     A morpheme such as -d: can occur with a subject pronoun            (nominative) in unaccusative clauses (310) or object pronoun (accusative) in transitive clauses (311). All            subjects (i.e. subjects of transitive clauses (which only appear if the object is third-person). unergative            subjects, unaccusative subjects. and subjects of passives and reflexives) are in the nominative case in            Kadiwéu. Objects are marked by a different set of pronominals.            If we were dealing with case, I would            expect pronominals co-occurring with -d: to belong to a same structural class (i.e. nominative. accusative.            or ergative). This is not the case —        there is one form that indicates      that the pronominal   is in the            nominative case and another that indicates accusative case and -d: co-occurs with both. The morpheme -            d: indicates the semantic role of a pronominal. theme. not its case. This fact indicates to me that the            transitivity morphemes         are operating on theta   role assignment     --   hence   the label semantic   role            morphemes.

"                This result has implications for language typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers' 1994            prediction that transitivity is assigned at the syntactic level in all languages whose arguments      are            pronominals, rather than nominal phrases or an empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. I have proposed a           parametric variation based on an insight in Fukui & Speas 1986 to account for pronominal argument           languages. I argued that these languages are languages in which lexical categories do not project. On this           hypothesis, clauses in pronominal argument languages are formed by raising of a valent lexical item to           adjoin a functional category that functions as a light verb. Light verbs enable valent elements to theta-           assign.",[137]
"          My research also contributes to the maintenance of Kadiwéu. Bilingual education is crucial for the maintenance       of languages whose speakers have been in contact with speakers of dominant languages for years. The Kadiwéu       Indians have been interested in bilingual education, but there is almost no specialized work on this language which       could help in the preparation of pedagogical materials. The grammar and dictionary that I have prepared could be       used by the Indians and by Brazilian scholars engaged in bilingual education.",[17]

               I asked who said that the car hit Joseph and who said that John washed the dishes. Fifty speakers of           Kadiwéu. including adults and children over six years old, were tested. Some speakers answered that the           subject of -me:n 'say' could be either of the participants of the stories. but the Majority answered Joseph           and John respectively. Some children answered Pau! and John’s mother respectively: these children's first           language was Portuguese, however, and they learned Portuguese outside the village. Children who learned           Portuguese in the village answered Joseph and Joao, respectively, even when the test was applied in           Portuguese, that is. when the stories and questions were conducted in Portuguese.

               Additional examples are shown in 215-218. All the available evidence shows that a pronominal in a            Kadiwéu main clause can be coreferential with a nominal phrase in a complement clause. The data on            coreference constitutes strong evidence that pronominals. rather than pro, are arguments in Kadiwéu.'®

Verb and Noun Morphology           The structure of the verb seems to be similar in all the Waikurdan languages.* The verb agrees with the subject        and object in person and number (sg/pl). Kadiwéu, Toba, and Mocovi mark subject person with prefixes. but        number (pl) is marked with a suffix immediately following the root, although               in Kadiwéu the pluralizing        morpheme for the third-person subject of transitive and unaccusative verbs is a prefix. All Waikurian languages        have a directional prefix n- ‘hither’ which is added to a verb stem. They also have a set of enclitics which mark       direction and motion. Aspect and mood, but not tense, are marked on the verb in Waikurian languages. Kadiwéu       has seven aspect markers -- completive/incompletive/durative, telic/atelic, repetitive. and intensive — and two       mood markers. conditional and desiderative. There are also three negation markers.              Among   the Waikurian       languages, only Kadiwéu has a set of semantic role markers.","[49, 50]"

              According to my proposal. in languages like English (type A) recursive nominal phrase arguments are           not allowed due to the projection of functional categories. In languages like Japanese (type B) recursion of           nominal phrase arguments is not blocked, because only lexical categories project. In pronominal argument           languages (type C) nominal phrase arguments do not exist. because lexical categories do not project. No           Type D languages are attested.","[134, 135]"
"               By contrast, the actions expressed by verbs in a SVC are simultaneous, they express only one event.          and all verbs must be interpreted as having the same tense/aspect. The same pattern has been observed in          other serializing languages (Sebba 1987).",[115]

                   Grimshaw proposes that verbs in English have an a-structure and are theta-markers.          Eventive           nominals in English have an a-structure as well, but they cannot assign theta-role. Therefore. in order to           have grammatical arguments, eventive nouns need a theta-assigner. Thus, eventive nouns appear with a           preposition in English (e.g. donation of money to hospitals) and with a light verb in some constructions of           Japanese. My proposal is that Kadiwéu does not have any lexical category that is able to theta-assign. The          elements that [ classify as verbs in Kadiwéu        are similar to eventive nominals of of better known          languages: they are valent (i.e. have an argument structure in Grimshaw's terminology) but they are not

"           *7     The parametric variation proposed here is substantially different the one in Baker 1994. My proposal           can account for the existence of languages in which pronominals, rather than nominal phrases. are verbal           arguments. It does not mean that languages in which a small pro is an argument do not exist. But if they           do, they cannot be derived from the same parametric variation. Baker (personal communication,                        1995)           mentions that there are at leat two types of nonconfigurational languages: (a) languages which have empty           categories pro as arguments and whose verbs are overtly marked by agreement (Mohawk),                              and (b)           languages whose verbal arguments are pro, but whose verbs are not marked by agreement morphemes           (Jiwarli). Jiwarli does not have bound pronominals, but it shares a remarkable number of features with           languages        as Mohawk.      Kadiwéu     presents   evidence for a third class of noncofigurational         languages:           languages in which bound pronominals are arguments.",[147]
"
         Spontaneous speech illustrating free constituent order is not easy to find in Kadiwéu because nominal phrases are       usually absent in this language. Any inflected verb in Kadiwéu corresponds to a complete sentence in English:       (151)     jib:a:taGawa.

"           °°      The claim that nominal phrases in Kadiwéu are adjuncts predicts that the coindexation of a
           pronominal subject and a noun inside a nominal phrase referring to the object is allowed because the           pronominal subject will not c-command the nominal phrase referring to the object. Note. however. that           sentences such as (i) are ungrammatical.          A pronominal cannot be coreferent with a noun inside a           possessive   phrase.    The same     phenomenon    is attested in other nonconfigurational      languages   such   as           Navajo, Warlpiri, and Arandic languages (Ken Hale. personal communication. 1995). The only language          that allows coreference between a pronominal and a noun in a possessive clause is Mohawk (Baker 1994).",[145]
"                  What transitivity means in terms of generative grammar is controversial. Jelinek (1994.             1995)           interprets transitivity as the ability to assign theta-roles. Baker (1991, 1994) takes a different perspective:          according to Baker. verbs in pronominal argument languages have no case to assign to complements.",[119]

It seems that            constructions whose object is understood as third person are in fact like such English sentences as John            ate. that is, semantically there are two arguments (we know that John ate some food). but syntactically the            construction is intransitive.            *¢          assume that pronominals are elements of a non-projecting D(eterminer) category: that is. a
            functional category that bears person and number features. The claim that D does not project is supported            by    the     fact   that   quantifiers   appear   incorporated   to   locative   predicates   in   Kadiwéu.    Moreover.           demonstratives are likely to be verbs and there is no articles. Kadiwéu is not the only nonconfigurational           language to lack determiner projections. Bittner & Hale 1995 argue that Walpiri has no items of the           syntactic category D.",[147]
"             According to Boggiani. the Kadiwéu Indians used to mark their wood tools and animal skins with symbols        which resemble a writing system. Currently the Kadiwéus use the Portuguese writing system,            so the hypothesis        that they developed a writing system cannot be systematically tested because the evidence was lost.",[20]

"               Thomason et al. 1994 show that the facts of at least one Salishan language can be better understood if           valency and transitivity are distinguished. Thomason et al. maintain that verbs are associated with two           representations: a representation that encodes the number of arguments a verb requires, given its meaning.           and a second representation that encodes the syntactically relevant argument-taking properties of a verb           According to Thomason et al.'s proposal, Montana Salish differs from better-known languages in that only           valency is a lexical property that is inherent to Salishan verbs; transitivity is assigned in syntax via           transitivizing morphemes.",[118]
"             Valency in Thomason             et al.'s terminology corresponds to the lexical semantics of a predicate in           generative grammar.        Generative grammarians have been trying to capture the lexical properties of           predicates in formal representations since Chomsky 1965. The context-sensitive subcategorization rules of           Chomsky 1965 ware the first attempt to represent the semantics of a verb. More recently, lexical semantic           representations have taken the form of predicate decomposition (Carter 1976, Dowty                       1976, Jackendoff           1976,     1987,   1990),   Hale     &     Keyser   1987,   Rappaport     &     Levin   1988,   Zubizarreta   1985).   These           representations are generally termed Conceptual Structures or Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) and

           are primarily focused on representing the syntactically relevant parts of verb meaning. Grimshaw 1990           presents further development in the understanding of the lexical semantics of predicates. According to           Grimshaw, nouns and verbs have a lexico-semantic representation (LCS). but verbs and eventive nominals           are distinct from regular nouns in that only the former include an aspectual dimension in addition to a           LCS (a-structure). Thus. according to Grimshaw. verbs and eventive nominals have an a-structure. while           nouns lack an a-structure. A complete understanding of the semantics of a predicate is still subject of           research,   Tenny   1994 and   Levin &    Rappaport    1995,   for instance.   present   further articulation    of           Grimshaw's a-structure.","[118, 119]"
