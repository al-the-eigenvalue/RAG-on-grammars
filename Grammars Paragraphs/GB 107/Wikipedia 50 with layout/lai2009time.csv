The particle jaari ‘already,’ since it combines with perfective situations, always advancesthe narrative time in the text. Besides the properties of temporality, jaari and jaa can onlybe used in affirmative sentences and are ungrammatical in negative contexts, thereforepatterning as Affirmative Polarity Items.","[520, 521]"
"       Sentence (297) consists of an affirmative clause. As seen in (298), to negate aprincipal or independent clause, the negative particle caa is directly placed at thebeginning of the clause, which is caa negation.",[197]
"The negative particle caa is contracted with the copula verb t++ as a contracted form                                               58
cat+ ‘is not,’ which is placed directly in front of what is to be negated. Example (30) isan affirmative copula sentence, and (31) is the negative version with the contractednegative particle and copula.","[76, 77]"
"       Negation in imperative sentences is, at first sight, indicated by the potentialmarker -cuma, as in (36). However, this grammatical marker does not have a negativemeaning itself as it is also used in affirmative contexts. The reason for this preliminaryconfusion is due to the omitability of the negative particle in combination with the secondperson singular pronoun, comparing (36) with (37). The possibility of omitting thenegative particle and the grammatical person does not exist if the negative imperativesentence is directed to other grammatical persons. Refer to section §4.6.3 for a detaileddiscussion.",[78]
"       Examples (289) and (290) show that some negative clauses can be marked onlyby the negative morpheme -ji, although this is not common and not agreed on by all thespeakers. The fact that a given negative clause can possibly be marked with only thenegative morpheme -ji confirms its negation meaning.",[194]
"       There are two principal strategies of clausal negation in Iquito: one uses thenegative particle caa (referred to as caa negation hereafter) and the other uses thenegative morpheme -ji in combination with the negative particle caa (referred to as ji-caanegation hereafter). In caa negation, the negative particle caa precedes a pronominalsubject or a non-topicalized subject phrase, and follows a topicalized element if any. Thisstrategy is generally used in principal/independent declarative clauses and yes/noquestions. In ji-caa negation, the negative particle caa follows an inflected verb, in whichthe verbal root is followed by the negative morpheme -ji, followed by tense and aspectinformation. This strategy is generally used in wh-questions, relative clauses, andembedded clauses of cleft constructions. While caa negation does not have variation inirrealis mood, ji-caa negation varies structurally in irrealis clauses. The negative particlecaa in ji-caa negation may appear repetitively in the postverbal position as well as inpreverbal position if no other elements appear between the subject and the verb of anirrealis clause (detailed in §4.3.2). In adverbial and complement clauses, either one ofthese two strategies can be used.",[186]
        The negative particle in caa negation can also precede a non-topicalized subject.,[187]
Negation is expressed through a negative morpheme marked on the verb and a negativeparticle in the postverbal position.,[164]
"4.3.2 Ji-caa Negation       Ji-caa negation uses the negative particle caa, plus an additional negativemorpheme -ji attached to the verb root, to negate a clause. This strategy is used in thefollowing types of clauses: wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleftconstructions. Complement and adverbial clauses can adopt either caa negation or ji-caanegation. In ji-caa negation, both -ji and caa contribute to the negation meaning. Thenegative marker -ji is a portmanteau morpheme which encodes both the negation and theclause-type information. The fact that it also conveys the negation meaning is supportedby two pieces of evidence. First, it is ungrammatical for it to appear in an affirmative
                                           171
clause; second, in some cases, caa is omitted while the clause still retains its negationmeaning. It is possible to consider ji-caa negation as a type of negative agreement since itagrees with the type of the clause it occurs. However, it is unlike a typical inflectionalagreement marker for the following reasons. First, it cannot appear freely in any negativeclause, but only in wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleftconstructions. Second, it attaches to the root (as opposed to stem) form of the verb, whichindicates that it behaves more like a derivational morpheme in Iquito. Diagram 7 showsthat the negative particle caa follows the inflected verb and the negative morpheme -ji issuffixed to the verbal root, preceding tense and aspect information.","[189, 190]"
"4.3.1 Caa Negation       Caa negation uses the negative particle caa in the pre-subject position to negatean entire clause. It is used in matrix clauses of declarative sentences and yes-noquestions. Diagram 6 below shows the structural position of caa in relation to other
                                            168
constituents of the clause. When there is a topic element in the negative clause, caafollows this element; otherwise, it precedes a non-topic element.","[186, 187]"
"Third, the negated elements are not repeated again in the embedded clause, which is verysimilar to how focus is usually expressed crosslinguistically. Based on the above-mentioned characteristics, it could be said that in Iquito, the cleft construction is used toexpress focused elements (i.e. affirmative and the constituent negations). Another point isthat the relative pronouns iina/iimi/iip+ are not always obligatory. Although they arepreferred by some speakers, they are used more often when more than one embeddedclause is used. Example (27) shows that in a negative embedded clause, an additional
20 In Iquito, the difference between an independent clause and a dependent clause is that for a dependent
clause, it is generally grammatical to add the word iina at the beginning of the clause. Iina can function as a
subordinator, a relative pronoun, a determiner or a demonstrative, depending on the context in which it
appears. In an independent clause, on the other hand, such an addition would otherwise make the sentence
ungrammatical.

negative morpheme -ji is attached to the verbal stem followed by the tense/aspectinformation, followed by the negative particle caa.","[75, 76]"
"4.6.3 Negative Imperatives and Jussives       In negative contexts, imperatives and jussives have the same structure, both usinga negative particle caa (or ca= as a clitic) in combination with an unmarked perfective
                                           261
aspect -Ø and the morpheme of potential mood -cuma. Negative imperatives, also called‘prohibitives,’ and jussives are only used before the negative events are realized.","[279, 280]"
"It is noted that the combination of General Perfective Aspect -Ø and the potential mood-cuma is only used in the context of a negative imperative or negative jussive. It is neverused in an affirmative context. From the discussion above, we can see that in bothaffirmative and negative constructions, the word order is observed to reflect realis wordorder—SVX. The speakers indicate that they expect the addressed events or theassociated process of the addressed events to be realized upon uttering the sentences. Thefollowing are two textual examples. The speaker expects that the situation can be realizedright away.",[281]
"In (286), the negative particle caa both precedes and follows the verb marked with -ji.",[193]
"Note that expressions of constituent negation imply an affirmative presupposition beforethe negative version is uttered. Therefore, expressions of constituent negation often implycontrastive focus. The characteristics of Iquito constituent negation as focus are asfollows. First, when only a subject or an object is negated, instead of the entire clause,only the negated constituent is fronted to the beginning of the sentence, separated fromthe original clause. Second, a copula construction is adopted for the negated elements,followed by a finite clause. The whole sentence is usually called a cleft construction.",[75]
"         In sentence (283), -ji marks the verb, followed by the negative particle caa,displaying the basic pattern of ji-caa negation. The wh-word is the subject, followed bythe object phrase nu-nasi ‘his garden,’72 followed in turn by the verb. This is theconfiguration of irrealis mood (SXV word order).",[192]
"
                                            170
       The final point of caa negation is that the negative structure is not sensitive tomood. That is to say, the syntactic position of the negative particle does not vary becauseof the grammatical mood. Sentence (276) expresses realis mood (SVX word order), withGeneral Perfective Aspect and Recent Past Tense, while sentence (279) expresses irrealismood (SXV order), with Momentary Perfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense. Thenegative particle caa in both sentences follows the topicalized element and precedes thepronominal subject, remaining in the same position structurally.","[188, 189]"
"                                            172
In addition to wh-questions, relative clauses also adopt ji-caa negation. As can be seen in(281), this sentence consists of a principal clause and a relative clause. In the principalclause, the negative particle caa precedes the pronominal subject and in the relativeclause, caa follows the verb which is additionally marked with -ji.","[190, 191]"
"Diagram 6. The Schematic Structure of Caa Negation
{topic} caa71       {pronominal or non-topicalized subject}            {verbal complex} {object}        The negative particle caa can precede a pronominal subject, as can be seen in
(274). The sentence consists of an independent declarative clause, in which only caa isused to negate the entire clause. No other negation marking is found on the verb.",[187]
"In the above-mentioned contexts (i.e. affirmative and negative declaratives,interrogatives, and non-CF conditionals), the situation in the sentence is in the past,present, or immediate future. As such, realis mood seems to align with perception orassessment of time, rather than with assertion.",[173]
"         In negative contexts, both imperatives and jussives use a negative particle in
combination with an unmarked perfective aspect, General Perfective Aspect, and the95 There   are seven perfective aspects in Iquito: General Perfective, Momentary Perfective, Remote
Perfective, two Deictic Perfectives, Allative Perfective and Ablative Perfective, which are discussed in
detail in §5.
96 According to Patience Epps (p.c.), in some languages, in particular, aspectual indicators in imperatives
have a politeness function. For example, Hup perfective aspect makes a polite imperative to emphasize that
the imposition will be of limited duration (Epps, 2008). In Iquito, because perfective aspects are obligatory
in imperatives, the use of perfective aspect does not specifically carry a function of politeness. To make a
polite request, speakers could express imperatives in a softer tone. Alternatively, they might use other types
of clauses, such as desideratives. They could also express their expectations indirectly to another person
and have them indirectly convey their expectations to the intended addressee.

morpheme of potential mood -cuma.97 Negative imperatives and jussives are only usedbefore negative events are realized. In both affirmative and negative constructions,speakers indicate that they expect the addressed events or the associated process of theaddressed events to be realized upon uttering the sentences.","[257, 258]"
"The second type of sentential negation in Iquito exists in interrogative clauses andsubordinate clauses, including relative and adverbial clauses. In this type of construction,a different negative morpheme -ji is marked on the verb, and the negative marker caa,which precedes the verb in the first type, now follows the verb, as in (12).",[69]
"4.5.2 Optatives         The second strategy, optatives, with the Imperfective Aspect and the potentialmood -cuma, is used to express a weak prediction or wish about a potential event in thedistant future. As optatives generally convey a prediction, the wish is conveyed throughimplicature and is cancellable.91 The sentence can be affirmative or negative and theperson who expresses the prediction or wish is always the first person, the speaker.",[240]
"Besides the above-mentioned elements, the negative particle can also appear in the Xposition in certain types of clauses63 (i.e. interrogatives, subordinate clauses) underirrealis mood. First, we see a negative interrogative clause in realis mood, as in (231).",[164]

Ema indicated that the following negative sentence can also be used to express a wish.","[241, 242]"
"        The Desiderative expresses a past or present wish for an event to be realized (ornot) in the future relative to RT. The sentence can be affirmative or negative. Theaddressee, if also the action-performing referent, is obligated to realize the event. TheDesiderative is frequently used to rephrase commands (i.e. imperatives or other directiveconstructions) or wishes (i.e. by optatives) of other people. Correspondingly, the subjectof the verb nacar++- ‘want,’ the person who expresses the expectation, can be anygrammatical person and not necessarily the speaker of the sentence. The Optative,marked with Imperfective Aspect in combination with the potential mood,85 expresses aweak prediction or wish about a potential event in the distant future. The wish isconveyed through implicature as this construction does not always express a wish andgenerally expresses a prediction. The sentence can be affirmative or negative and theperson who expresses the prediction or wish is always the first person, which is thespeaker. A CF wish expresses a past or present counterfactual situation which the speaker
strongly desires to be realized or to have been realized. However, no action-performingreferent is obligated. The sentence can only be affirmative and the person who expressesthe wish can only be the first person, the speaker. I discuss desideratives in §4.5.1,optatives in 4.5.2, and CF wishes in 4.5.3.",[231]
"         In terms of realis/irrealis marking, which is realized by word order, bothaffirmative and negative imperatives and jussives are observed to reflect realis wordorder SVX, instead of irrealis word order SXV. Payne (1997) indicates that imperativesare usually expressed with irrealis structures crosslinguistically, reflecting the fact that animperative commands that something happen rather than asserting that it has alreadyhappened. Given the fact that affirmative jussives can be used when the event is alreadyin actual progress, the perfective aspects, together with the realis word order SVX, in theaffirmative imperatives, negative imperatives and jussives express a strong expectation ofthe realization of addressed events. Indeed, some affirmative imperatives, especiallywhen the addressees are first person plural inclusive or second person plural, might bestructurally ambiguous with a perfective sentence which indicates a realized event.",[258]
"       Unlike caa negation, ji-caa negation presents many syntactic variations sensitiveto mood (i.e. in irrealis clauses). The negative particle in such clauses can appear after theverb, as in the basic pattern, before and after the verb, or only before the verb in somecases. Recalling the requirement of irrealis mood (i.e. one element should occupy theposition between the subject and the verb), when this requirement is fulfilled, then caa                                             173
stays in the postverbal position, maintaining the basic pattern. When the object of aclause is dislocated to form a wh-question, or stays in the postverbal position, thenegative particle caa appears between the subject and the verb, by which the requirementof irrealis mood is fulfilled. Sometimes, when caa already appears in the preverbalposition, it does not appear again in the postverbal position. In each variation, the verb isobligatorily marked with the negative morpheme -ji.","[191, 192]"
"Interrogative sentences (232) and (233), show that when the object appears at thebeginning of the sentence as a wh-word, as in (232), or remains in the postverbal position,as in (233), the negative particle caa has to be copied to appear in the X position,otherwise the sentence is ungrammatical. When a copy of the negative particle caaappears in the X position, the postverbal caa can appear optionally without changing thegrammaticality of the sentence.",[165]
"       From the examples shown above, we see that caa negation is not sensitive totense, aspect, or mood. The syntactic position of the negative particle remains the same,following a topic element and preceding a pronominal or non-topicalized subject.",[189]
"       (T.HMS: 202; re-segmented and translated by IWL)       If the speakers don’t expect the addressed events to take place right away (i.e.immediately or on the same day which includes SpT), they use the Imperfective Aspect(vowel length or -yaa/-aa) and the potential mood -cuma, in combination with the irrealisword order—SXV. In this construction, affirmative or negative, the speaker expresses aweak prediction or wish to indicate that the event might take place in the distant future.",[283]
"       In Iquito, sentential negation in principal and independent clauses is expresseddifferently from embedded and interrogative clauses. As such, there are two mainpatterns of sentential negation. The first main pattern of sentential negation, named caanegation, exists in independent or principal declarative sentences. The negative markercaa precedes the pronoun subject or follows the topicalized item if there is any. Thesecond main pattern of sentential negation, named ji-caa negation, exists in embeddedand interrogative clauses. Here a different negative morpheme -ji, which follows the
verbal root and precedes tense and aspect morphemes, is marked on the verb, and thenegative marker caa, which precedes the main verb in the first main pattern now followsthe main verb. See §4.3 for schematic structures of sentential negation.",[73]
"4.3 NEGATION AND MOOD        This section discusses clausal negation. Following the discussion in §4.2,negation aligns with neither realis nor irrealis mood. The choice of realis or irrealis mooddepends on the temporal reference of the sentence; there is, therefore, no direct semanticinteraction or correlation between negation and mood. However, since the X position ofSXV word order, expressing irrealis mood, can be filled by a negative particle in anirrealis clause, there is a certain structural interaction between negation and mood that isworthy of discussion. This section includes only examples from declaratives andinterrogatives because other types of clauses, such as imperatives, use a completelydifferent negative morpheme and display a different syntactic structure. Negativeimperatives (i.e. prohibitives) are discussed in §4.6. Clausal negation in Iquito adopts twostrategies, one in matrix clauses and the other in subordinate clauses. The currentnegation section discusses the matrix-clause strategy in §4.3.1, and the subordinate-clause strategy70 in §4.3.2. In §4.3.3, I discuss the scope of negation and the function of70 Anderson (2004b) discusses the Iquito negation in subordinate clauses extensively.

The current negation section does not include a theoreticalanalysis of negation structure. For a proposed theoretical analysis, please refer to Lai(2006b) for more discussion.","[185, 186]"
"       In caa negation, the negative particle caa is placed at the beginning of theutterance, if there is no topic element, to negate the entire sentence; it follows a
                                            55
topicalized element and precedes the resumptive pronoun. As can be seen in (22) incomparison with (21), when the subject is a non-topicalized pronoun, the negativeparticle caa is placed directly at the beginning of the sentence without changing theposition of the subject. On the other hand, if there is a topic element, as in (23), caafollows such an element and precedes the resumptive pronoun, as in (24). Example (25)is a case of constituent negation of the subject. As can be seen, the cleft construction isused to express subject negation. It is noted that the negated subject cannot be repeatedagain before the verb in the embedded clause, as in (26).","[73, 74]"
"       In affirmative contexts, imperatives and jussives are formally distinct structures,while in negative contexts, imperatives and jussives use the same type of formalstructure. In terms of realis/irrealis marking, which is realized by word order, bothaffirmative and negative imperatives and jussives are observed to reflect realis wordorder—SVX, instead of irrealis word order—SXV. In this section, I also discuss howimperatives, when there is an explicit pronoun, are distinguished from past perfective                                             266

"         In Iquito, there are two major types of sentential negation. The first one occurs inindependent declarative sentences. The negative particle caa precedes the pronounsubject, as in (11), or follows the topicalized item if there is any. The position of caa isnot sensitive to tense, aspect, or mood under this type of construction.",[69]
"         In affirmative contexts, imperatives and jussives are formally distinct structureswhile in negative contexts, imperatives and jussives use the same type of formalstructure. Affirmative imperatives can appear with all seven perfective aspects,95 except
when they are pragmatically incompatible. In fact, the use of one of the seven perfective96aspects is obligatory in affirmative imperatives. The seven perfective aspects renderdifferent interpretations in terms of the location where the events are to be carried outand, therefore, the direction and trajectory of addressees’ movement. The ImperfectiveAspect can never be used in the imperative constructions. The affirmative jussives, on theother hand, appear only with the Imperfective Aspect and can never appear with anyperfective aspect. In correspondence with this formal observation, imperatives are usedbefore the potential event is realized while jussives can be used both before the event isrealized and when the event is already in progress.",[257]
"       As can be seen from (484) to (488) in the following, negative commands can haveall grammatical persons as the action-performing referents, except first person singularand first person plural exclusive. The addressee(s) is second person. The speakerscommented that example (484) might be used to think to oneself: ‘I shouldn’t sayanything,’ but the sentence is never verbally uttered. Example (485) is ungrammatical. In(486), the addressee is also one of the action-performing referents. In (487), it is notedthat the addressee is second person singular and the explicit mention of the subject isoptional. However, the negative particle and the second person singular subject pronounare either both omitted or both present. When the subject is one of the other grammaticalpersons, the subject pronoun and the negative particle are obligatorily present, as in(486), (488)-(490).",[280]
"       When the situation in the sentences is in non-immediate future (i.e. from as soonas later on the same day of SpT to the more remote future), irrealis mood is used. Again,this applies to both affirmative and negative declaratives, interrogatives, and non-CFconditionals. Sentence (251) refers to a situation which the speaker states that he willrealize later in the same day of SpT. As can be seen, the subject qui ‘1S’ is followed bythe object núquiica anitáaqui ‘a peccary,’ followed by the verb pani- ‘search.’ Thesentence displays SOV word order, expressing irrealis mood.",[173]
"In (284), caa precedes and follows the verb which is marked with -ji. The questionedelement here is the subject as well. However, the object nu-naana ‘his wood’ does notappear between the subject and the verb, but remains in the postverbal position. In
comparison with the above example, the negative particle caa in the current exampleappears postverbally as well as preverbally, forming a linear SXV Word order to fulfillthe requirement of irrealis mood. Compare this sentence with (286) below.",[192]
"
71 Cynthia Anderson Hansen reminded me to add this information.The negative particle caa here is in
focus position and cannot co-occur with a focused element: Adverb occurs in focus position, as in (302);
with the introduction of negation, adverb occurs after the object, as in (303).

85 The potential mood -cuma is also used in another construction, in combination with the unmarked
General Perfective Aspect -Ø, to express a negative imperfective in which a strong expectation about a
negative event being promptly realized is conveyed.

The negative particle caa follows the pronoun subject and then precedes as well asfollows the verb. The fact that caa can also occupy the object position in the SOVenvironment further supports the idea that the SOV pattern is highly marked.,[70]
"        The locative/existential is expressed as iiquii ‘there is/are’ in the affirmativecontext, as in (32).

future,’ which is the semantic meaning I claim for this morpheme. If a doctor uses -cuma and says ‘this
child might never talk,’ clearly he does not have such a negative wish; instead, he is making a weak
prediction based on his current diagnosis. However, as -cuma is frequently used in an affirmative sentence
by the speakers, such a sentence is frequently interpreted as a wish by the speakers. The ‘wish’ sense of the
morpheme -cuma, therefore, is yielded from its pragmatic use and is cancellable.

"However, these imperatives and perfective declaratives are generally distinguished by the

imperatives and jussives, in which it appears with an unmarked perfective aspect. It is also used in
combination with the Imperfective Aspect, in both affirmative and negative sentences, to indicate an
uncertain prediction or a weak wish in which the speaker is not certain if the event will be realized. The
events in this construction are further remote in the future.

First, in affirmative imperatives, explicit pronouns are pronouncedwith long vowels at the last syllable, as p++= ‘first person plural inclusive’ and quinaa=‘second person plural’ while in past perfective declaratives, these two pronouns arepronounced as having a high pitch on the first syllable and short vowels on all syllables,as p'+= ‘1P.INCL’ and quína= ‘2P.’ Second, non-vowel-hiatus phenomena, 98 asintroduced in §4.2, exist in imperatives under certain phonological environments. Third,most perfective declaratives appear with tense markers while the imperatives are alwaysin Extended Current Tense. Fourth, speakers can use a temporal adverbial jaa ‘already’before the subject pronoun to further clarify a past perfective declarative. Fifth, speakersuse their pragmatic knowledge as well.","[258, 259]"

59 This, applying to both transitive and intransitive clauses, includes postpositional phrases (noun plus
postpositional clitic) or determiner plus postpositional clitic, leaving the nominal phrase in the postverbal
position. The list here is representative. For an exhaustive list of the possible types of elements, please refer
to Anderson et al. (2006).
60 This, applying to both transitive and intransitive verbs, appears in complementizer-type clauses,
including wh-questions and subordinate clauses, when nothing appears between the subject and the verb. In
Iquito, clausal negation is sensitive to clause types, please refer to §4.3 for a detailed discussion.

         In a transitive clause, the types of elements that can appear in the X positioninclude an indefinite grammatical object or pronoun, the determiner of the definite object,adverbs, adverbial phrases, postpositional phrases consisting of a noun plus apostpositional clitic, a determiner plus a postpositional clitic, and negative particles if noother elements appear in such a position. What cannot go in the X position is a completenominal phrase or postpositional phrase containing a determiner. To be exact, [adeterminer plus noun]61, as a definite object, cannot appear in the X position, but [anindefinite article, or a modifier, plus noun] can.","[161, 162]"
"       In the types of clauses introduced above, the negative particle caa follows theverb. As can be seen in (280) which is a wh-question, caa is in the postverbal positionand -ji is marked after the verbal root, as part of the verbal complex. It is noted that -jiappears after the verbal root to which only derivational morphemes attach. This suggeststhat in Iquito -ji is considered a derivational morpheme.",[190]
"Sentence (234) is an interrogative ditransitive construction. The direct object appears as awh-word at the beginning of the clause, followed by the subject pronoun. The indirect

shortened to ca.

"One more point in terms of the structure of affirmative imperatives is that theImperfective Aspect can never appear in imperative sentences. In the following, I showungrammatical examples.",[275]
