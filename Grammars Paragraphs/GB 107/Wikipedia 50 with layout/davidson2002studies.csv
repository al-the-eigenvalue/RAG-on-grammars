7.2.16 Interrogative (Nuuchahnulth)The Interrogative mood in Nuuchahnulth is used in forming both content questions and yes/noquestions. In content questions it attaches to an interrogative functioning as predicate head.

Referring phrases (RPs), the syntactic realization of referring ex-pressions, are claimed to be headless relative clauses or “nominalized” clauses, where “nominal”is understood to mean “referring expression”.116 This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that all fullwords (except proper names) are predicative, as Swadesh (1933, 1939) proposed early on. Hence,the difference between (common) nouns and verbs is not in their ability to function in differentgrammatical roles, for there is only one major syntactic role in Southern Wakashan, predicate

4.2 MorphologyMakah and Nuuchahnulth are polysynthetic languages making extensive use of suffixation, in-cluding enclisis. Reduplicative prefixation, used to form plurals and express aspectual distinc-tions, is also important. These are the only morphological techniques, apart from a few plural in-fixes and some aspectually significant changes in vowel length. Reduplication and changes invowel length are also used to create special base forms required by some affixes (§3.3.1). There isno prefixation (apart from reduplicative prefixes), compounding, or noun incorporation.46
4.2.1   Word structureA full word (as opposed to a particle) has the structure shown in Figure 1. The structure issimplified for expository purposes; a slightly more complex description is given in Chapter 5. Allfull words (e.g. nouns, verbs, etc.) have the same structure.",[108]
"Class-inclusion predicatesIn Makah and Nuuchahnulth, nominals may function directly as predicate heads with no interven-ing copular element.52 They take predicate clitics exactly as verbal predicates do: there are no re-strictions on the predicate clitics they may occur with. The words in (205)-(206) show Makahnouns and property words as heads of class-inclusion predicates; that is, predicates denoting aclass of entities the subject is asserted to be a member of.53 Example (207) shows an intransitiveverbal predicate for comparison. The coding of each clause type is identical: the mood and pro-nominal clitics are attached directly to the predicate head in all cases. (Only the masculine singu-lar gloss is given for the third person examples for sake of economy.)             MAKAH

In this dissertation, predicates in constructed sentence examples are usually marked withIndicative mood (the unmarked mood for conversation), but examples cited from texts are fre-quently subject-marked absolutes. See, for example, (176)e-f, (178)b, (179)c etc. below. Pre-sented with a subject-marked absolute out of context, Makah speakers typically “correct” it to amood-marked predicate.","[119, 120]"
"    Southern Wakashan mood clitics express a varied set of modal, evidential, and speech-actcategories. Most of these are in paradigmatic opposition, but a few may co-occur to form moodcombinations (§7.2.3). Mood clitics include the Indicative illustrated above for both languages,the Purposive M, N <""`9 ‘in order that’, interrogative moods used to form both yes/no and con-tent questions, the Conditional M <pdx(t), N <pt9 ‘if, when; would’, the Nuuchahnulth Dubi-tative <p@E` ‘perhaps’, and the Subordinate M <W, <p`9, N <p@, which forms that-clausecomplements of predicates of saying, thinking, etc. as well as causal (‘because’) clauses, and, inMakah, ‘when’ clauses (in conjunction with Ftxt ‘when’). There are also several evidentialmoods in both languages, including the Quotative M <v`9s, <v`9c`, N <vDFhm and inferen-tial moods. The Makah Relative <(p)hj, <(p)h and Nuuchahnulth Definite Relative <FHsp andIndefinite Relative <(x)h9 moods form relative clauses. See Chapter 7 for more on the form andfunction of these and other mood clitics.",[118]
"    On the contrary, the point of using ,RhQ in (323) is not to express some intrinsic characteristicof the situations (like momentary duration), but to present a particular view of them relative toother situations in the flow of discourse, whatever their intrinsic structure might be. This is “ex-trinsic” or viewpoint (Smith 1996) aspect, a “temporal restriction on what is asserted” (Klein1995: 690).90 Here the basic distinction is between perfective and imperfective aspects. Followingthe spirit (though not necessarily the letter) of Klein’s (1995) “time-relational” analysis of aspect,the difference between perfective and imperfective can be thought of as a difference in the scopeof assertion relative to internal situation boundaries. As I interpret this with respect to SouthernWakashan, viewpoint aspect does not express durativity or lack thereof (as situation-type aspectwould), but rather, by selection of one (viewpoint) aspect over another, a speaker elects to includeor exclude any phases or boundaries that already exist in the meaning of a base. For example, in
                                                 220(323)c, by choosing ,RhQ, which we now reinterpret as a perfective suffix, the speaker includes allphases of the situation in his assertion, and thus in effect presents it as a completed whole relativeto other situations in the discourse context. The following Nuuchahnulth text excerpt (from Text39) shows example (323)c in situ, with its immediately preceding and following sentences.","[235, 236]"

"    The word in (275)b demonstrates an entirely different grammatical relationship between suf-fix and base. Unlike ,Ch, the suffix ,BT ‘in a container’ does not determine the class of the resul-tant word, which remains a noun; it adds information about the base and limits or restricts its de-notation, much as an adjective or relative clause limits the denotation of an English noun: theword’s potential referent is not only a pack-basket, but a pack-basket that is in a container.

1 IntroductionThis dissertation is a description of major features of Southern Wakashan (Nootkan) grammarusing data from two languages, Makah and Nuuchahnulth (formerly called Nootka).1 Because thedissertation is descriptive in intent and written for a general linguist audience rather than prac-tioners of a particular linguistic theory, no specific grammatical formalism or framework is em-ployed. Southern Wakashan does, however, raise various issues of theoretical import, and, at ap-propriate points, theoretical implications are considered. The grammatical concepts and terminol-ogy used in the description are generally vernacular among linguists, apart from those specific tothe Southern Wakashan descriptive tradition; these are defined as necessary.","[15, 16, 17]"
"    By far the majority of suffixes are lexical suffixes. Lexical suffixes are a Northwest Coastareal phenomenon that also appears in Salish languages, and Quileute.76 They earned this namebecause they have meanings more typical cross-linguistically of open-class lexical morphemesthan closed-class grammatical morphemes. They express a wide range of concepts, and research-ers on languages that have them have proposed various semantic classification schemes. Boas(1947: 236-7) expresses reservations about classifications of this sort on the grounds they imposecategories of the researchers’ languages on the languages of study, but concludes in the end thatthey are harmless and descriptively useful as long as it is clear that they make no claim to repre-sent native classifications.
                                                180    His worries about imposition of external categories on the object language are clearly well-founded, and even today this is a common pitfall of comparative semantic research. Lucy (1994:624) describes such research as follows:         Lexical items are grouped together [in analyses of this sort] and analyzed as a
         coherent set not because speakers of those languages group them together in a set
         as revealed, for example, by common grammatical treatment, but because the
         analyst so groups them. And meanings are assigned not on the basis of close ex-
         amination of actual usage, but on the basis of rough functional equivalence with
         forms in our own language. Thus an external framework is imposed on the lan-
         guage in place of a framework deriving from its native logic.","[195, 196]"

7.2.7   SubordinateThe Subordinate is used most often in realis complement clauses following predicates of perceiv-ing, saying, thinking, and feeling. In Nuuchahnulth, such clauses are frequently preceded by thesubordinating particle F`mh.",[288]
"Speakers I checked with recognized the form, but felt it was archaic and suggested the simpleConditional instead: Ihbtwi`cHpdxrHj. This may be a result of attrition of more recondite formsin a language death situation. (In Nuuchahnulth, wishes have been observed in the Subordinatemood with the irrealis future clitic N <(x)hj: JhlrRhF`shjp`r ‘may I be bitten, i.e. let my bait betaken!’ at NT 108.8 JhlrRhQ ‘bite on bait’; see also (394)a.)f) The Conditional may also be used as an indefinite or non-specific article in RPs, replacing the    regular article clitic:

        ‘Louse would always bring two deer out of the woods on his back.’ (NT 84.35-36)   In Nuuchahnulth, Conditional clauses that are part of a sentence with multiple mood-markedclauses can be marked as hearsay by the quotative formative <C. For example, the sentence in(403) is a conditional sentence with two finite clauses, an if-clause (the protasis) and a then-clause (the apodosis). The protasis rhosTo FtpQMtJi`I`spTC ‘if one is holding a stick’ has theConditional clitic in combination with <C.","[295, 296]"
"In cases where it is optional, its appearance seems to be conditioned by some functional parame-ter akin to definiteness. Sapir (1924: 84, note 9) calls <FH a “suffixed definite article, often usedas nominalizing element”, Swadesh (1948: 109) calls it a “definite suffix”, and Rose (1981: 250-
                                                29853) describes it as a definite and particularizing marker. Jacobsen (1973: 21) says the Makah arti-cle “indicates a certain definiteness of reference”. It is true that RPs whose referents are definite(in the sense of identifiable) and particular (specific and referential) almost always have an arti-cle, sometimes in concert with the preceding demonstrative particle, x@ in Nuuchahnulth106 or sH‘this’, WT ‘that’ and related forms in Makah.107 For example, the referents of N pTF`rFh ‘theman’ in (443)a and N x@ pTF`rFh ‘the man’ in (443)b are introduced in preceding sentences oftheir respective texts (Text 13 and Text 76) and are thus identifiable and particular.","[313, 314]"
"An important distinction of the latter sort among nominal predicates is between clauses withclass-inclusion predicates (called “true nominal predicates” by Dryer [to appear]) and those withequational predicates. In a (declarative) class-inclusion clause the subject is asserted to be amember of the class of entities denoted by the predicate, e.g. John is a teacher. An equational
                                                129clause, on the other hand, asserts that the individual denoted by the predicate is the same as theindividual denoted by the subject, i.e. the latter is equated with the former, e.g. John is theteacher. In English, the two types are distinguished in several ways (Lyons 1977: 471-72, Dryer[to appear]). The examples in the previous section are of the class-inclusion type, e.g. (205)a MvhjvHx@jr ‘I am a boy’. We see from those examples that class-inclusion clauses in SouthernWakashan have the nominal expression as the (syntactic) predicate head. Clauses with equationalpredicates are formed at least two ways. The first, and less preferred, way, only attested in Nuu-chahnulth, is to use the same construction found in class-inclusion clauses: the entity to which thesubject is equated serves as predicate head with the appropriate predicate clitics attached:(211)   NUUCHAHNULTH
        G`VhKl`         ghK     wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
        G`VhK<l@        ghK
        chief=INDIC     there
        ‘He is the chief there.’ (based on NA 47.2)Although the translation of (211) in the source and its discourse context make clear that it is to betaken as equational, out of context it is presumably ambiguous between class-inclusion and equa-tional readings, i.e. out of context (211) could also mean ‘He is a chief (i.e. high ranking male)there’. (The usual English gloss for G`VhK, ‘chief’, is misleading because it implies unique statusfor its referent in a group. The word actually refers to any high-ranking male, so a group can havemore than one G`VhK –– the class-inclusion reading is perfectly plausible, and, as we see next, isprobably preferred.)    The second, and more common, construction involves pronouns interposed as copular ele-ments. This is in fact the only possible construction if the (semantic) predicate is a personal name,place name, an RP with the article, or, in Makah, an RP with a possessive clitic, because thesetypes of nominal expressions cannot normally function as syntactic predicate heads:55
                                                    130(212)       MAKAH

             *‘Bill is the teacher.’(The prohibition against co-occurrence of mood clitics and the article will be shown to be naturalwhen I suggest in §4.5.1 that the article itself is a mood clitic.)    The precise form of the correct construction in Nuuchahnulth depends on the person of thesubject, which is the entity on X-side of the semantic equational schema. If it is first or secondperson, the predicative form of the appropriate independent pronoun intervenes as predicate head,and the entity on the Y-side of the equational schema is simply syntactically apposed to it:56(213)       NUUCHAHNULTH

             ‘I am the priest.’The literal force of this construction appears to be ‘I am I (who am) Niinispatwas’, with the nameor RP-with-article as an “appositional complement” to the predicate. This is supported by the factthat the very same construction translates as ‘It it I, NAME’.","[144, 145, 146]"
    The phrases and sentences in (260) and (261) each contain derived words with multiple nu-clear suffixes. The word in question is repeated below the example’s translation with labeledbracketing to show its constituent structure; buffer consonants (§5.2.2) and indications of CVtemplate associations are omitted from the bracketed representations to faciliate readability.,[180]

"Swadesh (1939: 79) points out two lexical suffixes with both obvious phonological and semanticsimilarity to an extant root: the path suffix N ,l`K,, M ,a`K, ‘moving about’ with root N l`K,‘move’, M a`K`s, ‘(large object) tremble, shake’, and the verbalizing suffix N, M -v@(K) ‘say ...’with root N, M v@ ‘say’. We might also compare the root N FHpG, ‘tell, narrate’ (probably re-duced from earlier *Fhx`pG,) to the verbalizing suffix N ,hx`pG [R] ‘sing ... song’, or, in Kyu-quot dialect, ‘tell ... story’ (Rose 1981: 356). A final example involves the primitive root elementN, M vh, that occurs as a component of various roots expressing negative concepts, e.g. N vhj,M vhjH ‘not’, N vHX`, M vHx` ‘never’, M vHa` ‘not know, recognize a person’, N vhF`ji‘invulnerable, unafraid’, N, M vH,p, ‘angry, unpleasant; stormy, bad (weather)’, and many oth-ers.84 This element evidently occurs as a suffix in a single Nuuchahnulth derivative, rtvHX`j‘instrument for not holding, nothing to hold’ (< rt, ‘hold’ + ,vH + ,X`ji ‘... instrument’)(Swadesh 1933: 154). These root/suffix pairs exhaust readily detectable examples. More typicalis the situation shown in (319): roots with semantically similar suffixes are not phonologicallyrelated to them:(319)   Root                             Lexical Suffix        N O`OH, M OhOhFH ‘ear’           N ,""hlK, M ,""`ahK                ‘at the ear’        N p`rH, M p`khFH ‘eye’           N ,(b)rt(K), M ,(j)rhK           ‘at, in the eye’

"    Sentences illustrating this or that grammatical construction often contain complicationsthat might obfuscate, rather than illuminate, it. Accordingly, I have introduced two sorts ofmodification when citing Nuuchahnuth text sentences in support of grammatical claims. Thefirst is omission: grammatically optional words or clauses irrelevant the point being made aresometimes left out. Ellipses indicate omitted material. For example, a text sentence intendedto demonstrate a simple transitive clause like the Nuuchahnulth analogue of The next morn-ing they charred their canoe-bottoms to make them smooth in the water might be simplified inthe dissertation example to ...They charred their canoe-bottoms...",[20]

Comrie (1976: 19-20) mentions several other languages that allow this type of reading with perfective markers onstative verbs. In these languages, among them Ancient Greek, Spanish, and Russian, this possibil-ity is apparently limited to a handful of verbs. In Southern Wakashan, on the other hand, it is therule –– almost all stative bases produce a change-of-state readings with the perfective suffix.

Or, phrased in aless English-centric fashion, we might say what is expressed as motion (with ‘go’ or ‘come’) inEnglish is often not expressed as motion in Southern Wakashan, but as simple change of location(‘get to be at X’). This can also be seen with the nuclear verbalizing suffix M, N ,Ch ‘at ...’, whichmeans ‘get to be at ...’ (usually glossed as ‘go to ...’) when it is followed by the perfective suffix.","[240, 241]"

  Makah is the usual English rendering of the Clallam (a neighboring Salish language) designa-
tion for the tribe. In their own language, the Makah call themselves pihchCC`F@sW and their lan-
guage piHpiHchCC`p. Both words are regular formations based on the root pihchCC`,p,, a place
designation of uncertain reference (Renker & Gunther 1990: 429). The question of an appropriate
name for the other language appearing in the dissertation is difficult. The traditional name in the
anthropological and linguistic literature, Nootka, is not of native origin and disliked by the
community. In 1978, the Southern Wakashan people of Canada adopted the name Nuu-chah-nulth
(mTC@MtK ‘mountain range’) (Arima & Dewhirst 1990: 410). However, as an ethnonym, this
name actually subsumes peoples speaking two languages, those speaking the language formerly
referred to as Nootka and those speaking the closely related Nitinaht or Ditidaht. I follow Naka-
yama (1997a, see especially p. 2) in using Nuuchahnulth in a restricted sense as a linguistic des-
ignation to refer only to the language formerly known as Nootka. Note that I simplify the spelling
by eliminating the hyphens. Ditidaht is referred to as such.
2
  Makah has not been used as a medium of daily communication for decades, and, at the time of
writing, there were only three fluent speakers, all elderly.
3
  Interestingly, in phoneme charts given in his M.A. and Ph.D. dissertations (1931: 10, 1933: 4),
Swadesh did group /F/ and /Y/ with the glottalized consonants. The latter work agrees with Nootka
Texts in grouping the affricates with the stops, but the former has them listed separately.
4
  Sapir and Swadesh refer to them as “voiced continuants”; Rose and Nakayama call them “reso-
nants”.
                                                 350
5
   Sapir and Swadesh label the “Mid” row “Mid-wide”, the “Central” column “Back”, and the
“Back” column “Back Rounded”.
6
   This, incidentally, is the reason Sapir & Swadesh (1939) represent the high back vowels with
the symbol ‘o’, rather than ‘u’. The mid back vowels are represented by them with open o. Ac-
cording to Sapir & Swadesh (1955: 4), by the time Nootka Texts was in press, Sapir had decided
‘u’ was more appropriate. This has been the standard symbol for the high back vowels since Sapir
& Swadesh (1955).
7
  A syllable consists of an obligatory onset consonant followed by a single nuclear vowel, long or
short. The coda may contain zero, one, or more consonants (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 13, Stonham
1994a: 76). Consequently, a nasal (or any other consonant, for that matter) is in the coda if it im-
mediately precedes another consonant, or occurs in word-final position.
8
   In early works, Sapir wrote the murmur vowel with either ‘i’, e.g. ,pElhK ‘round thing’ in
(1911a: 16) (-phlK in current orthography) and hmhjv,hgk ‘fire in the house’ in (1921) (FhmjihK in
current orthography), or with ‘i’, e.g. ""ιmhj# ‘fire’ in (1924).
9
  [L] indicates the suffix requires the first vowel of its base to be long. See §3.3.1. The colon dia-
critic is explained in §3.1.
10
    This rule correctly places primary accent in Makah, but there may be secondary accent at work
as well since there are sometimes perceived prominences in addition to the primary accent, espe-
cially on long vowels. It is unclear whether these are merely phonetic correlates of vowel length
or part of the accent system. Accent in Makah is stress accent, which is probably the case in Nuu-
chahnulth as well.
11
   Wilson (1986) formulates a similar rule in metrical terms. See also Stonham (1994a, b).
12
   Jacobsen (1969b: 13-14) also discusses Sapir & Swadesh’s (1939) treatment of labialization.
13
    Vowel-glide contraction also operates synchronically in some cases. See, for example, discus-
sion of (65)b in §3.3.1.
14
    However, caution is required here because Makah vowel-glide sequences do not always corre-
spond to persistently long vowels in Nuuchahnulth. For example, corresponding to the Makah
suffix ,Cdx`K ‘... many days’ we find Nuuchahnulth ,CHK, which contains a long vowel that neu-
tralizes as normal.
15
    ,hmj is derived from the underlying form ,(C)hmji by other processes. See below and §3.3.8.
Incidentally, a more accurate, but also more cumbersome, gloss for l`ji, is ‘conduct a commer-
cial exchange, esp. buy’.
16
    There are apparent exceptions in this environment, e.g. l`jFTjs ‘purchased goods’ (< l`ji,
+ ,-FTjs ‘obtained by ...’).
17
   For exceptions see §5.5.4.
18
    There are several other templates in addition to those listed in here that appear in aspectual for-
mations (e.g. [RepR], [IterL]). These are described in Chapter 6.
19
     The [LR] abbreviation is introduced in Jacobsen (1997a) as a substitute for Sapir and
Swadesh’s original symbol [RG].
20
   See examples (66) and (69) below.
21
    This process, traditionally referred to as “hardening” by Wakashanists, occurs in both branches
of Wakashan, and is one of the best known aspects of the phonology. Confining ourselves first to
sources that deal only or primarily with Nuuchahnulth, we can cite (among others) Sapir (1911a:
16; 1924: 82, note 1, 90, note 62; 1938), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238), Swadesh (1933: 6), Rose
(1976, 1981: 18-19), Nakayama (1997a: 16-19). On hardening (glottalization) in Ditidaht, see
Swadesh & Swadesh (1933: 200), and, for Makah, see Jacobsen (1996) and §3.4.2.
                                                351
22
   Cf. also Sapir’s (1938, reprint 1949: 231-32) discussion of the historical origins of glottaliza-
tion, where he argues that it is unlikely to have been simply a result of coalescence of consonant
+ glottal stop clusters.
23
   Like glottalization (§3.3.2), lenition (referred to as “softening” by Wakashanists) is a well de-
scribed process, and the two are often treated together. Many of same sources are relevant: Sapir
(1924: 92, note 84; 1938), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238), Swadesh (1933: 5-6), Rose (1976,
1981: 18), Nakayama (1997a: 19-20). On lenition in Ditidaht, see Swadesh & Swadesh (1933:
199), and, for Makah, see Jacobsen (1996) and §3.4.2.
24
   Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238) cite QtX`r ‘good on the ground’, but this form is not attested in
the corpus. QtKF`r is found at NA 15.18.
25
   Sapir (1938, reprint 1949: 236), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 237), Rose (1981: 22-23)

   Final /a/ is present underlyingly, but does not appear in the surface form due to a rule of final
vowel deletion in Makah (§3.4.3) (cf. also Jacobsen 1971).
31
   Boas (1947: 238), Lincoln & Rath (1980: 111)
32
   This, incidentally, raises the question of the historical source of modern Southern Wakashan
non-labialized velars, which, with the exception of /w/, are by no means rare in the present day
languages. That is, if PW velars became alveo-palatals, whence the velar in morphemes like the
N, M root j`, ‘stick-like object protruding’?
33
   TRANS = transitivizing suffix used with stative or intransitive verbs (Boas 1947: 241, #6); NOM
= nominal suffix (Boas 1947: 323). Thanks to Emmon Bach for checking my Kwakwala forms.
He drew my attention to the fact that Boas (1947: 353) erroneously writes the ‘lick’ root in (120)c
with a plain voiceless velar stop. I have substituted the correct glottalized form per Lincoln and
Rath (1980: 244).
34
   See Haas (1969: 111-112, 115-120) for discussion and examples of similar correspondences
between Nuuchahnulth and Ditidaht.
35
   This word, like many others with original */Wi/, now contains morphophonemic /Gi/ (§3.3.2).
36
   Makah voiceless stops undergo the allophonic process of coda aspiration described for Nuu-
chahnulth in §2.1.
37
   This example and the next are found on page 16 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in
Jacobsen’s possession.
38
   Jacobsen (1996) indicates these segments with a capital barred-l.
39
   Jacobsen (p.c.) has recorded this suffix as ,#` and ,#h. The ,#t form appears in my data.
40
   This example is found on page 9 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in Jacobsen’s posses-
sion.
41
   See §2.5 for accent.
42
   Some speakers change /@/ preceding /v/ to /N/ so they would have [c`9Kn9w].
43
   Interestingly, Ditidaht shows similar patterns of syncope except that, in Ditidaht, it is the sec-
ond of the two vowels that deletes rather than the first. See Swadesh & Swadesh (1933).
44
   This first-syllable shortening sometimes seems to apply also in words that have undergone ep-
enthesis (§3.4.3).
45
   More fully translated in Makah as ‘good, rich tasting, full of fat (said of shellfish)’.
46
   Actually, the question of whether Makah, Nuuchahnulth, and other languages with lexical ver-
balizing suffixes can be characterized as incorporating is controversial. I am agreeing with the
                                                352
view expressed by Sapir (1911b) and Mithun (1984), among others, that these languages are not
incorporating. See Jacobsen (1993: 266-67, note 2) for discussion.
47
   Swadesh himself (1933: 11, note 1) compares them to the Latin enclitic conjunction -que.
48
   At least one of these, x@K ‘yonder’, is attested in Makah as well.
49
   See §4.4.1 for brief comments on grammatical relations. The relevant aspect of this topic here
is that a subject category can be justified for Southern Wakashan.
50
   Cf. Swadesh (1933: 101-02).
51
   This characteristic of Nuuchahnulth and Southern Wakashan languages contrasts sharply with
the situation in Salish languages, which are generally quite careful about indicating transitivity.
52
   However, equational clauses involving personal names, place names, and RPs that contain the
article do require a copular element. See below for discussion.
53
   See Chapter 8, note 114 for discussion of classification of property words.
54
   Jacobsen (1979a: 114) tentatively reports a possible restriction in Makah against occurrence of
the future tense clitic with nouns. However, I was able to elicit several examples of nouns with
this clitic with no difficulty.
55
   A few exceptions to this generalization have turned up in Nuuchahnulth, but syntactic predi-
cates expressing names all seem to have existential readings, e.g. there at the door is Codfish-
always-getting it (the name of a family crest), rather than equational readings.
56
   See §8.2.3 for the forms of independent pronouns.
57
   Cf. Sapir (1924: 86, note 31)
58
   This claim does not apply to proper names, which, as discussed in §4.4.3.2, cannot function as
(syntactic) predicate heads.
59
   Swadesh (1939: 82) proposes the same analysis, labeling the Nuuchahnulth article a “subject
relative” in a list of modal formatives and glossing it ‘he who is, does’.
60
   However, the proper analysis of Makah RPs with possessive clitics, which have essentially the
same syntactic distribution as the article, (e.g. E`o`b<rhr ‘my canoe’) is as yet unclear.
61
   Some have suggested that referring expressions in Salish languages are also nominalized predi-
cates or clauses. See, for example, van Eijk (1997) on Lillooet and Thompson, Thompson, &
Egesdal (1996) on Thompson. Similar claims have been made for other languages of the Ameri-
cas. See Comrie & Thompson (1985: 391-95) for a brief review.
62
   Relative roots do have the special property of remaining the grammatical head of the word
when affixed by nuclear lexical suffixes, which otherwise become head themselves. See §5.1.
63
   These might be considered a kind of equational clause (§4.4.3.2).
64
   Often it is also possible to express manner of action and relation in a single derived verb, with
the manner expressed by the base and the relation by a suffix, e.g. M J`b,hx@, N J`b,H pinch-
give.PERF ‘pinch sth off and give it to’, M C`p,hx@, N C`p,`xH push-give.PERF ‘push sth to sb’,
M Bhbj,hx@ throw-give.PERF ‘throw sth to sb’, N b`r,Hbr chase-bringing.along ‘chase sth
along’. For an example of the first word, see (201)b.
65
   With some hesitation he terms this construction “serialization”, a characterization I find mis-
leading because of the many differences between the Southern Wakashan construction and con-
structions called “serial verb” constructions in other languages, e.g. 1) any number of predicates
can be so combined (although more than two or three is uncommon), 2) the set of predicates from
which bare absolute predicates can be drawn is open-ended, 3) any lexical item can fill the role of
main predicate or of the bare absolute.
66
   “Serialization combines multiple clauses into a unit that expresses a single state of affairs (=
event or state), i.e. a predication” (Nakayama 1997a: 115).
                                                 353
67
    See Anderson (1985: 9-10) and Spencer (1991: 37-39) for introductory discussion. In Sapir’s
(1921: 142-43) morphological typology, Nuuchahnulth (or Nootka, in his terminology) is classi-
fied as having a polysynthetic level of synthesis and “agglutinative (symbolic tinge)” technique.
68
   See Fortescue (1994) for more detailed characterization of polysynthetic languages.
69
   In a 100-word sample from Text 2 in Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 19-21), Jacobsen (1993: 266)
counts an average of 3.66 morphemes per word in Nuuchahnulth, which just slightly lower than
Greenberg’s (1954) figure of 3.72 morphemes per word in a similar sized sample from Eskimo.
70
   Figure 2 should be understood as a static representation of the structure of existing words,
rather than a generative device for creating new words. Without extensive filtering or constraint
mechanisms, Figure 2 will generate many impossible words.
71
   This statement does not apply to words formed on relative roots like N x`pi, M x`p@ ‘one
who, that which’, which always determine the category of the resultant word regardless of suffix
type, e.g. N x`pi plus the verbalizing suffix N ,FhC ‘clothed in ...’ forms the noun x`piFhC
‘clothing, what one is wearing’ rather than the verb *‘wearing sth that is ...’.
72
   The terms “core” and “peripheral” are borrowed from Nakayama (1997a), where they are used
in a different sense.
73
   See Haas (1972) for more on Nootkan root structure.
74
   As mentioned later (see note 114 in Chapter 8), it is not clear if evaluative and dimensional
terms are a subclass of verbs or constitute a separate class of adjectives.
75
   See Rose (1981: 284-89) for a different classification scheme.
76
   Eskimo languages also have suffixes of this type, which are sometimes called “post bases” in
the specialist literature (e.g. Jacobson 1984, Miyaoka 1996). Eskimo, Wakashan, and Quileute are
strikingly similar in their reliance on these suffixes to the virtual exclusion of other word-
formation techniques. Eskimo languages are even more extreme than Wakashan and Quileute in
this respect.
77
   Other works refer to nuclear suffixes as “governing” suffixes, a term I avoid since nuclear suf-
fixes sometimes do not “govern” the base in the sense used in current grammatical theory.
78
   This statement is generally true, but oversimplified. Certain restrictive path-orientation suffixes
have the effect of deriving verbs due to their inherent perfective aspect (§5.5.1). In these cases,
the restrictive suffix could be considered the grammatical head, but the base remains in some
sense the main semantic element.
79
   These types roughly correspond to Swadesh’s (1933, 1939) governing action and governing
state suffixes.
80
   Rose (1981: 357-58) categorizes most of my verbalizing state suffixes as “adjectival” rather
than “verbal” suffixes, but, assuming her (p. 344) definition of the adjective class, it is not clear
how this could be correct. Jacobsen (1979a: 139) refers to Makah ,h9b ‘belonging to ...’ as form-
ing adjectives, but since he considers Makah adjectives a subtype of intransitive verb, there is no
disagreement with the present analysis.
81
   Locale suffixes are called “zone” suffixes in Davidson (1999).
82
   The initial vowel is shortened due to insertion of the long epenthetic vowel (§3.4.3).
83
   “The use of suffixes for adding new material ideas to the initial morpheme is common to a re-
stricted area inhabited by all the Kwakiutl dialects, Nootka [and other Southern Wakashan lan-
guages––MD], Quileute, and Salish. Outside of this area it is unknown. Its closest analogue is
found in the suffixes of the Eskimo language” (Boas 1947: 236).
84
   This root element must go back to Proto-Wakashan, cf. Kwakwala forms such as vhP5mWi` ‘to
fail to go straight to a person’ (Boas 1947).
                                                 354
85
   My analysis of Southern Wakashan aspect draws on that of Swadesh (1931, 1933, 1939), Sapir
& Swadesh (1939), and Rose (1981), but, as will be seen, differs in certain respects from each of
these.
86
    Actually, to be more precise, aspect is indicated by the final morphological constituent of a
stem. This is often a single morpheme, as stated in the text, but may also be a combination of two
or more restrictive spatial suffixes, which together have a single aspectual value (§5.1), or an as-
pectually significant CV template applied to a base.
87
   “[A]ll verbs have durative and momentaneous, or inceptive, aspects, most have also at least one
iterative aspect, and many have still other aspects” (Sapir 1924: 82, note 1). “The aspect system
consists of a set of categories based on two primary aspects, durative and momentaneous.” (Sapir
& Swadesh 1939: 240).
88
    “We may class Nootka words into three semantic types, on the basis of their meaning in the
durative and momentaneous aspects” (Swadesh 1931: 24).
89
    These definitions were formulated for momentaneous and durative categories in Ditidaht, but
can be shown to reflect Swadesh’s thoughts on Nuuchahnulth as well, although these were never
so succinctly expressed.
90
   Some authors (including Klein) reserve the term “aspect” for viewpoint aspect.
91
   In fact, potential for occurring with the graduative imperfective is a good test for determining
whether a base is perfective.
92
   Rose (1981: 275) describes the graduative morpheme as [L] in Kyuquot dialect, but examples
like perfective M, N v`g@j ‘go’: graduative M, N v@g`j ‘going’ show that it must be [L+S] in
Tseshaht and Makah.
93
   The term “continuative” is from Rose (1981). Sapir & Swadesh (1939) simply call this aspect
the ‘durative’, not differentiating it terminologically from the ,`ji/,tj durative described in
§6.5.2.
94
   This kind of “what-if” elicitation technique was suggested to me by Ann Renker (p.c.).
95
   Formation of the repetitive in Makah is first described in Jacobsen (1971).
96
   Iterative formation is first described for Makah in Jacobsen (1971).
97
   Note in this regard that the formal resemblance between the Habitual enclitic <F`9K` (§7.4.2)
and iterative II morphology may not be coincidental.
98
   See also Swadesh (1933: 8-11), Rose (1981: 291-92), and Nakayama (1997a: 21-23).
99
    Jacobsen (1973) describes a “relative” formative ,W (e.g. in vhJHsW vdFhC ‘no one is sleep-
ing’). Since I judge this to be a specialized use of the peripheral suffix ,(W)W ‘while, meanwhile’
rather than a clitic, it is not discussed in this chapter.
100
     See also Rose (1981: 212-234) for Kyuquot dialect forms and Nakayama (1997: 30-41) for
Ahousaht.
101
    The Inferential I is, however, listed in Sapir (1924: 101, note 178).
102
     These formatives are not mentioned in Sapir & Swadesh (1939), but are listed in Swadesh
(1939: 82-83).
103
     Two other Makah morphemes given by Jacobsen (1986) as evidentials, ,P`ch and Jtj, are
here analyzed as specialized peripheral layer evidential uses of lexical suffixes rather than as cli-
tics. In this regard, it is significant that <oh9s follows the temporal specifier, which shows it must
be a clitic, but -P`ch and ,Jtj precede it. This does not guarantee peripheral suffix status, but is
consistent with it.
104
     Jacobsen (1973) refers to the first of these moods as the “informational interrogative” and the
second as the “confirmational interrogative”.
                                                355
105
    There are a few examples of it attaching to a lone demonstrative in Nuuchahnulth, however,
e.g. F`GjTFh ‘that one’.
106
    Tseshaht x@ is probably cognate with the morpheme g@ in Kyuquot dialect that Rose (1981:
40) describes as a definite article.
107
    In Makah, the article itself may be extended by demonstrative elements: <?hp`9c proximate
article, e.g. PhcHkhp@c ‘this dog’, <?hp@b distal article, e.g. PhcHkhp`9b ‘that dog’.
108
    See Rose (1981: 206, ex. 43; 209, ex. 60-61)
109
     Rose (1981), Rose & Carlson (1984), Whistler (1985), Emanatian (1986), and Nakayama
(1997b) may be consulted for further discussion of passivization in Nuuchahnulth, especially the
controversy over whether this construction should be properly be considered a passive or an in-
verse. The reader will correctly infer from my labeling the morpheme in question “passive-
inverse” that I consider the question to be terminological. The Southern Wakashan construction
simply mixes properties associated with constructions called “passive” and “inverse” in other
languages. It appears to be intransitive like the English passive, but is subject to person and topi-
cality hierarchies like inverse constructions in Algonquian languages.
110
    An obvious alternative analysis of this construction some have suggested describes ,(C)hK as an
object case marker. Rose (1981: 62-67) presents several arguments against such an analysis and
for a multi-clausal analysis like the one given here.
111
    This is perhaps a typo for ,@bxhm, the normal shape of this suffix, cf. Sapir & Swadesh (1939:
319).
112
    Makah has a morpheme ,""tW seems analogous to the Nuuchahnulth irrealis clitic, but it is not
yet fully analyzed.
113
    In formal speeches first person singular forms may have plural reference (i.e. ‘I’ = ‘we’).
114
    The classification of many words expressing property concepts is unclear. This uncertainty
primarily involves free roots like dimension terms, e.g. M, N F`p ‘wide’, M FhFHWi`, N FHGi
‘big’, and evaluative terms, e.g. M QtKT, N QtK ‘good’, and also some words with the durative
aspect suffix, e.g. M, N Ihrtj ‘white’, M, N F`C`ji ‘propped, wedged up’. Most property words
probably belong to a subclass of verbs, as proposed by Jacobsen (1979a), but some may consti-
tute a separate class of adjectives (Rose 1981). Their syntax requires further investigation before
definitive classification can be made. Other property words such as those formed with suffixes I
have classified as verbalizing state suffixes (§5.4.1), e.g. M ,chs, N ,mhs ‘stocked with ...’, M, N

    Jacobsen (1979a: 84-108) includes a thorough review of various proposals concerning South-
ern Wakashan word classes in both the primary and secondary literature.
116
    This is a different sense of “nominal” from the one used in the preceding list of word classes,
where the word simply means ‘having the character of a noun, noun-like’.
117
    I therefore disagree with Nakayama’s (1997a: 64) contention that “...[T]here is no strong for-
mal basis for positing word classes in Nuu-chah-nulth. That is, there is no unique and constant
correspondence between sets of words and formal markers or formal structuring patterns that jus-
tifies grammatical classes among words.”

    Note also that this is a rare example of a post-head predicate modifier hosting a clitic.

    The speaker is the mythological culture hero Kwatyaat, whose speech is characterized by in-
serted /x/’s (Sapir 1915, reprint 1949: 186; Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 210, footnote 8).
120
    Jacobsen (1979a: 106) makes the same claim: “[T]he momentaneous [i.e. perfective––MD]
formation ... derives verbs from stems of other classes.”

5.8 SpecializationDerived words vary widely in spontaneity of composition and degree of lexicalization. Speakersare capable of using the principles of derivation we have discussed in this chapter to spontane-ously produce and interpret new words, but many derived words must be considered elements ofthe permanent mental lexicon, that is, words that are learned as units by speakers during thecourse of language acquisition and not derived anew for each use. The clearest indication of thisis specialization of meaning. Derived words frequently have meanings more specific than themeanings of their component parts would suggest. Examples are legion. The Nuuchahnulth wordFHGsTo (FHGi ‘big’ + ,(R)sTo ‘... species’) literally means ‘big sort, species of thing’ but nowdenotes only ‘whale’. The literal force of the component morphemes (‘big’ and ‘... species’) hasbeen lost, as shown by the fact that one can say ‘big whale’ by modifying the derived word withone of its own components: FHG FHGsTo ‘a big whale’ (NA 149.47). Similarly, N bhY`r (bhp,‘speak’ + -""`r ‘go in order to ...’) literally means ‘go in order to speak’, but it is now specialized

Derived words with specializedmeanings are commonly used for names of flora and fauna, tools, ceremonies, personal names,and place names, e.g.","[230, 231]"

4.4 Basic clause structure
4.4.1   RP functions and constituent orderIn addition to the predicate, a clause can (but need not) contain referring expressions that functionas subjects and objects, or in oblique roles. Referring expressions are expressed syntactically asreferring phrases (RPs) (§4.5). The predicate usually comes first in the clause followed by thecore (i.e. subject and object) RPs in either order. There is no case-marking or other overt meansof indicating which RP is subject, and which is object.","[124, 125]"

1.4 Previous literatureDespite the fact that the Southern Wakashan languages have attracted some of the finest minds inNorth American linguistics, only one complete grammar is available, Rose’s (1981) grammar ofthe Kyuquot dialect of Nuuchahnulth. This work provides an important counterbalance to therather anemic view of Nuuchahnulth syntax presented by Swadesh (1939) and, among other dis-coveries, recognizes the imperfective/perfective nature of the aspect system. There is a fairamount of descriptive material on Southern Wakashan in theses, journal articles and conferencepresentations. Much of this material is about the Tseshaht dialect of Nuuchahnulth, and is thework of Edward Sapir (Sapir 1911a, 1915, 1924, 1929, 1938), who initiated the scientific study ofNuuchahnulth, and his student and colleague, Morris Swadesh (Swadesh 1931, 1933, 1939,1948a). There are also the two volumes of Nuuchahnulth texts edited by Sapir and Swadesh(1939; 1955). Other notable works on Southern Wakashan languages other than Makah or notexclusively on Makah include two Nitinaht texts with grammatical analysis (Swadesh & Swadesh1933, Touchie 1977), papers on historical reconstruction by Haas (1969) and Jacobsen (1969a), adiscussion of labialization in Nootkan languages (Jacobsen 1969b), an investigation of Nootka-Nitinaht stem and root structure (Haas 1972), a discussion of variable-length vowels in Nuuchah-nulth (Klokeid 1975), a thesis on Nuuchahnulth phonology (Rose 1976), studies of Nitinaht encli-tics (Klokeid 1976, 1978), a note on Nitinaht numerals (Hess 1990), a discussion of Mary Haas’scontributions to Wakashan linguistics (Jacobsen 1997b), and several papers on Nootkan syntax(Rose & Carlson 1984, Whistler 1985, Emanatian 1986, Jacobsen 1993, Nakayama 1997b). Theinteraction of discourse and morphosyntactic structure in Nuuchahnulth is discussed in Nakayama(1997a); Nuuchahnulth-Nitinaht ablaut and reduplication patterns are discussed in Stonham(1994a). Stonham (1999) describes noun phrase structure in Nuuchahnulth.
                                                7    Work on Makah was begun in the early 1960s by W. H. Jacobsen, Jr. His research has fo-cused on various aspects of the (morpho)phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicography of thelanguage. This research program has produced the bulk of our knowledge of Makah. A number ofpapers concentrate on phonology or morphophonology. Jacobsen (1968) addresses the issue ofglottalized resonants in the historical reconstruction of Makah and uses this reconstruction to ac-count for some synchronic morphophonemic processes in the language. Jacobsen (1971) dis-cusses the widespread patterns of vowel insertion and vowel loss. Ablaut in vocative forms is pre-sented in Jacobsen (1994). Jacobsen (1996) describes the morphophonemic processes of “harden-ing” (i.e. glottalization) and “softening” (i.e. lenition) in Makah. Two papers, (Jacobsen 1997a,1998a), deal with ablaut/reduplication patterns. Jacobsen (1998c) describes labialization dissimi-lation. Finally, Jacobsen (1999a, 2000) discuss the “velar increment”, an excrescent /k/ that ap-pears in certain forms. In addition to these papers, there is another publication (Jacobsen 1979b,1999b) that contains useful discussion of the segment inventory, pronunciation, and morphopho-nemics, as well as several modal paradigms.","[21, 22, 23]"
"    Finally, there is an obvious difference in denotation between lexical suffixes and clitics. Aswe have seen, suffixes often have semantic content akin to that of independent lexical items, oreven phrases, in English, e.g. M ,(ji)h9K [L+S] ‘making ...’, ,hctW ‘looking for ...’, -`chK [L] ‘onthe neck’. The meanings of clitics (e.g. tense, mood) are much more abstract by comparison, andclearly mark them as belonging to the grammatical, rather than the lexical level, of the language.",[269]
"    Pronominal subjects in subject-marked absolute predicates are marked on the first word of thepredicate by a set of pronominal clitics, which, in Makah, has no form indicating third personsingular, and, in Nuuchahnulth, has no form indicating third person whatsoever. Bare absolutepredicates (by definition) have no subject marking. This means that a third person subject-markedabsolute is overtly indistinguishable from a bare absolute. For example, in the Makah sentences in(171), compare the third person singular subject-marked absolute in (171)a with the two predi-cates in (171)b, the first of which is the third person singular subject-marked absolute matrixpredicate vhJ`Q ‘He/she/it did, were not’, and the second, g`FtjRhQ ‘eat’, a bare absolute func-tioning as complement to vhJ`Q.",[119]
"    The spirit, if not the letter, of the present analysis of RP structure is anticipated by Sapir(1911a, 1924). The parallelism is somewhat obscured by the fact that, like other writers of thetime (cf. Andrade 1933 on Quileute, and Boas 1947 on Kwakwala), Sapir uses the terms “nomi-nal” and “verbal” in reference to kinds of linguistic categories that are today considered distinct;he uses these terms to refer to both lexeme categories (noun and verb) and logico-syntactic cate-gories (referring expression or noun phrase and predicate). (We leave open here the question ofwhether Sapir himself recognized such distinctions conceptually.) Making allowance for suchterminological conflation, we see the germ of the RPs-as-clauses analysis already in this earlystatement (Sapir 1911a: 17): “In both [Nuuchahnulth and Kwakwala] the stem is, as far as itsmeaning allows, indifferently verbal [i.e. able to function as predicate––MD] or nominal [i.e. ableto function as a referring expression] and one or more suffixes [clitics] are required to give rise todefinitely verbal [predicative] or nominal [referring] complexes; in [Nuuchahnulth] a suffixed[<FH] is often used to substantivize [i.e. make referring] a verb [i.e. predicative] form.” Like-wise, in Sapir (1924: 84, note 9), he says the article is “often used as [a] nominalizing element”.",[157]

"    In addition to the graduative, durative, and continuative imperfective aspects, which can becalled “uniplex” imperfective aspects, there are two multiplex aspectual formations, the repetitiveand the iterative. These imply various types of iteration of events versus the essentially steady-state meanings of the uniplex aspects. The repetitive, which expresses events repeated at regularand generally narrow-spaced intervals, is formed by a special reduplication type plus the suffix-(x)`. As we will see below, the repetitive has expanded its function somewhat beyond this inMakah to cover semantic space expressed by the continuative in Nuuchahnulth. The iterative,which expresses irregular iteration, is formed in two ways, one involving reduplication, and theother involving changes to the perfective form of the base.

6.4 PerfectivePerfective aspect indicates that all internal phases or boundaries of a situation are included in theassertion, i.e. are asserted to have taken place; the situation thus is presented as complete relativeto other situations in the discourse context. The exact meaning of the perfective word depends onthe semantics of the base to which the perfective suffix is attached. With punctual bases like MF`bj`s,, N stw, ‘jump’, M, N IhQp, ‘explode’ or M, N ghr, ‘strike with a beating instrument’the perfective expresses the simple occurrence of the event. If the base denotes an event that mayoccur repetitively, the perfective normally has a semelfactive sense –– it expresses a single repeti-tion of the event.","[239, 240]"

        ‘Then the Yai (a type of supernatural creature) went to his (own) wife.’ (NT 72.17)With processual bases the perfective expresses either inception of the process or (less commonly)its occurrence for an unspecified duration. This last usage is an especially clear indication of theperfective value of the suffix. It is often the case that text examples can be translated either waywith little difference to the overall meaning of the passage.

        or ‘ran (for some duration)’; see also (323)b-c    The perfective is most commonly used in discourse to narrate a series of completed pastevents. Occasionally, however, it occurs in an otherwise present context. Perfectivity in SouthernWakashan is by nature incompatible with present time reference: since the speaker, by choosingthe perfective, includes all situation boundaries in the assertion, and thereby asserts its complete-ness, this leaves little room for the situation to be interpreted as ongoing at the time of speaking.","[241, 242]"

6 Aspect6.1 IntroductionAspect and aspectual distinctions are pervasive in Southern Wakashan. Most words have, or areat least eligible for, aspect marking of one sort or another, including some that, from a non-Southern-Wakashan point of view, might not seem likely candidates for aspectual modification. Itis not uncommon to find words corresponding semantically to English nouns, adverbs, and tem-poral expressions marked for aspect along with those corresponding to English verbs and adjec-tives. Even lexical elements that are not formally marked for aspect almost always have someinherent aspectual value that must be reckoned with in determining their meaning, and, hence,their behavior in various morphological and syntactic contexts.85    Aspect is indicated by the final morpheme of the unextended word.86 This may be an aspectsuffix (322)a, or else aspect is inherent in the meaning of the final morpheme, whether it is a lexi-cal suffix (322)b or free root (322)c.","[231, 232, 233]"

"    The essential structural difference between a complement construction and an adverbial con-struction is that, in the former construction, the roles of the two clauses are not permutable, while,in the latter construction, they are.

"    The initial cranberry element in a such a root is no longer used productively, but comparisonwith related languages sometimes gives hints about their original meanings. For example, theNuuchahnulth verb FHE@oh ‘lifted up’, which consists of initial FhE`, plus ,`oh [L] ‘up in theair; erect’, may (etymologically) contain a root PW *FhJ, still attested in Kwakwala: FhJ ‘above’(from Boas 1947: 224 with regularized orthography). Correspondences between Makah and Nuu-chahnulth forms are often enlightening in this regard. Makah gtjsTo ‘bird’ is composed of thenominalizing suffix -(j)sTo ‘... thing, ... species’ plus cranberry element gt,, the original mean-ing of which is suggested by Nuuchahnulth gt, ‘flying in a flock’. Similarly, the Makah placename stjTchs, glossed ‘sea lion’ in the Makah Traditional Cultural Property Study (Makah Cul-tural and Research Center 1989: 2), refers to Ringbolt Rock, a sea rock located off Tatoosh Is-land. It can be morphologically analyzed as stj, + T epenthetic + -chs ‘stocked with ...’. Theregular Makah word for ‘sea lion’ is g`jv@chR, but Nuuchahnulth stj, ‘sea lion’ explains thetraditional gloss. Jacobsen (1979c: 776-77) cites other examples in which the initial element in acranberry root in one of the languages is a productive root in the other, e.g. the Makah nounQ`s@v`E`ji ‘(a) paddle’ consists of the nominalizing suffix ,E`ji ‘thing for ...’ on the cran-berry element Q`s@v`, or, minus the epenthetic vowel, Q`sv`,, which is transparently relatedto Nuuchahnulth Q`sV`, ‘paddling steadily’.",[191]
"    Underlying forms, which do double duty as citation forms, frequently contain diacritics thatspecify how or if certain morpheme-specific rules apply. It has not been possible to avoid usingmorphemes with diacritics in examples before the diacritics themselves have been introduced;readers may consult the list of abbreviations and symbols after the Table of Contents for briefexplanations of them. Most are used in the same way as in Sapir and Swadesh’s works, wherethey were originally introduced (see especially Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 236-39), although theirdiacritic conventions have been simplified in a few cases. Some of their original diacritics areused to abbreviate sets of allomorphs (cf. McCawley 1967: 108): they represent the phonologicalproperties of each allomorph in a single citation form by “superimposing” the allomorphs on oneanother. Sometimes, however, the present analysis posits a single underlying form for such lexi-cal items rather than an allomorph set, which eliminates the need for Sapir and Swadesh’s dia-critic. For example, labialized consonants alternate with their non-labialized homorganic counter-parts in word-final position and a few other environments (§3.2.2), e.g. we find l`l@rhX`ji,Hb
                                                 28‘belonging to a mud shark’, but l`l@rhX`j ‘mud shark’ without the suffix. In Sapir andSwadesh’s analysis, the ‘mud shark’ root has two allomorphs, the word-final allomorph/l`l@rhX`j/ and the pre-vowel allomorph /l`l@rhX`ji,/. They merge these to produce thecitation form l`l@rhX`j(i,), where the parentheses and hyphen show that the labialized allo-morph appears before vowel-initial suffixes. The analysis proposed in §3.2.2, on the other hand,posits the underlying form l`l@rhX`ji and an automatic delabialization rule. With this analysisthe parentheses and hyphen are redundant: since no labialized final consonant fails to alternate inthe relevant environment, there is no need for a special mark to signal the alternation.12    Many of the alternations described in this chapter are triggered by affixation. The languagedistinguishes an inner layer of affixes, mostly suffixes but also a few infixes, from an outer layerof enclitics. The inner affixes include various aspectual formatives and “lexical” suffixes, suffixeswith relatively concrete meanings like the verbalizing suffix ,rhlC ‘doing ritual for ...’. The cli-tics are more loosely joined to their host phonologically, and typically have more abstract gram-matical functions than inner-layer affixes, coding grammatical categories like tense, mood, andperson and number of the subject. The inner affixes and the clitics behave differently with regardto several of the phonological alternations described. Differences will be noted piecemeal as wego along, and a summary list of them can be found in Chapter 7.","[43, 44]"
"Literally, the construction means something like ‘X caused to be awake, doing it to Y’. See§4.6.1.1 for details on this type of construction.110    We turn now to the use of the passive-inverse in relation to the topicality hierarchy. Whenboth arguments of a transitive predicate are third person, the more topical of the two is generallycoded as subject, regardless of its role. If the A is more topical, the clause is direct: the A is codedas subject and the P is coded as object. If, on the other hand, the P is more topical, the clause ispassive-inverse: the P is coded as subject, and the A, if mentioned at all, appears as an obliqueagent RP. In syntactic terms, the passive-inverse clitic on the predicate head signals that the Prather than the A is subject. In discourse terms, it signals that the A is less topical than the P.
                                                 312    A definitive statement of the factors determining topicality in Southern Wakashan requires aquantitative text study, but recency of mention is a relatively clear-cut parameter that will serve todemonstrate the basic principles at work. In general, the more recently a referent has been men-tioned in the discourse, the more topical it is. If the A has been mentioned more recently than theP, and is hence more topical, it will likely be coded as subject, and the clause will be direct. Con-versely, if the P has more recently been mentioned, it will be subject, and the clause will be pas-sive-inverse. For instance, faced with the Makah sentences in (467)a-b out of context, an ad-dressee could interpret either sentence as ‘Bill saw Mary’ or ‘Mary saw Bill’.","[327, 328]"
"    The unextended word carries the lexical (dictionary) meaning of the word, while the cliticsspecify values for grammatical categories associated with the word in its syntactic context. AsSwadesh (1933: 11) puts it for Nuuchahnulth: “From the lexical point of view, the word is theunextended unit composed of stem plus derivational and aspect suffixes. From the syntactic pointof view, the word is the total phonetic unity, sometimes identical with the lexical unit, sometimesmore or less extended by [enclitic] elements.” In (153), for example, Makah vdFhE`k ‘he/she/it is
                                                 95sleeping’ is formed from the verb vdFhC ‘sleep’ plus the temporal specifier clitic <""`Q glossed“TEMP” (explained in §4.3.2 below) and<?h, the third person singular Indicative mood clitic.","[110, 111]"
"    As for the third claim, Boas fails to show that the distinction is an artifact of translation be-cause the revised translation of ‘see a canoe’ he proposes to demonstrate this is nothing more thana convoluted restatement of the original translation. His revision still contains a verb phrase,namely ‘to perform an action relating to ... by seeing’. Hence, the suffix with this translationwould still produce a verb rather than a noun, which is precisely what is predicted. Further, thefact that ‘see’ is restrictive in the new translation is irrelevant since it does not modify the rightword. If the suffix were restrictive in the present sense, it would modify the base ‘canoe’ and pro-duce a noun denoting something about a canoe that sees or is seen. Instead, the phrase ‘by seeing’is an adverbial phrase that modifies the participle construction ‘relating to ...’, which itself modi-fies the word ‘action’ in the verb phrase ‘perform an action’. As Swadesh (1948b: 62) himselfpoints out:
                                                    185            Boas says that ‘to see a canoe’ ... may as well be conceived as ‘to perform an ac-
            tion relating to a canoe by seeing.’ But, since the stem alone means ‘canoe,’ this
            translation includes for the meaning of the suffix ‘by seeing to perform an action
            relating to’ –– which leaves the problem exactly as before ... It is no mere trick of
            English translation but an inescapable fact that the relation of subject and stem
            remains the same in [(279)a and (279)c] but is radically changed in [(279)b].","[200, 201]"

5 Topics in Word Structure5.1 Formal structureAccording to a traditional morphological classification of languages,67 Southern Wakashan is aclassic example of a language family with polysynthetic word structure. Though definitions vary,a major criterion for polysynthetic status in most accounts is a high average number of mor-phemes per word. An important corollary is that a significant portion of these must be “lexical”,rather than grammatical in nature; that is, they should have meanings typically expressed by in-dependent lexical items in other languages. These morphemes might include incorporated nounsand adverbs, or semantically rich affixes like locative suffixes. Such features permit polysyntheticlanguages to have words with complex internal structure that often correspond semantically toentire sentences in less morphologically elaborate languages.68 True to type, words in SouthernWakashan can be internally complex with numerous morphemes and multiple hierarchic levels ofstructure packed into a single derivative.69    Southern Wakashan word structure can be described by the diagram in Figure 2, a moredetailed version of Figure 1 given previously in Chapter 4.70 The major structural division fallsbetween the unextended word (base + suffixes) and the extended word level (unextended word +clitics). Important formal differences exist between the two. The sequence of clitics has template-like organization with a fixed number of slots, flat structure, strict requirements on linear order of          Figure 2.

In contrast, there is no limitin principle to the number of suffixes that can be added to a base, and the order of suffixes canoften be changed to produce changes in meaning, as demonstrated by the following example setfrom Swadesh (1939: 86):(254)        NUUCHAHNULTH

The remainder of this section describes these formalaspects of unextended word structure further. Use of clitics has been briefly described in §4.3 andis more fully covered in Chapter 7.","[174, 175, 176, 177]"

6.2 The character of aspect in Southern WakashanAt least from Sapir (1924), researchers on Southern Wakashan have recognized a basic two-waysemantic aspectual distinction. As we will see below, I claim with Rose (1981) that the distinctionis between imperfective and perfective aspect, but the two categories were originally labeled“durative” and “momentaneous” by Sapir and Swadesh in Nuuchahnulth. This analysis is explic-itly stated in places,87 but, even where not claimed outright in their works, it is often implied.88Swadesh & Swadesh (1933: 199) give a representative characterization of the meanings of thedurative and momentaneous categories (as originally conceived) in Ditidaht:89        The durative expresses a continued existence, state, or activity; thus duratives are
        translatable by English nouns, adjectives, and verbs expressing states and contin-
        ued activities. The momentaneous expresses momentary occurrences, including
        transitions into states and states of activity (these are generally translated “to start
        doing ...”).",[234]
"
5.4 Nuclear suffixes
5.4.1   Verbalizing suffixesVerbalizing suffixes fall into roughly two groups, one creating verbs expressing actions or activi-ties undertaken by their S/A argument, and the other creating verbs expressing a state, quality, orcondition, defined, as Swadesh (1933: 65) says, “with the aid of the underlying [base]”. We referto these types as verbalizing “action” and verbalizing “state” suffixes, respectively.79    Verbalizing action suffixes generally denote more abstract or superordinate types of actionsthan verb roots. For instance, some verbalizing action suffixes denote a generalized type of actionlike ‘consume’, whereas verb roots in the same semantic domain express a specific subtype ofthat action like ‘eat’ and ‘drink’. Consider these Nuuchahnulth examples:

In the same way, seeing and hearing are ways ofperceiving, and hitting, slapping, pecking, punching, etc. are all ways of directing blows. Even incases where translations do not make the contrast apparent, there are usually subtle differences inusage between roots and suffixes with similar meanings, e.g. the free verb root N mtmTj, MctcTj ‘singing’ denotes the activity of singing per se, while the suffix N ,hx`pG, M ,dx`W [R]‘singing ... song’ denotes the performance of a particular song denoted by the base. See §4.6.1.1for examples of how these general-action verbalizing suffixes are used in conjunction with man-ner roots in discourse.","[202, 203]"

7.2.15 Content and Polar Interrogatives (Makah)Makah has a mood for forming content questions and another for polar (‘yes/no’) questions.104The Content Interrogative attaches to an interrogative word like F`C`p ‘who’ or v@r` ‘where’,which functions as predicate head. The word may be underived, consisting of an interrogativeroot alone (all the interrogative roots are free roots) (416), or derived, consisting of the interroga-tive root plus lexical suffixes (417).(416) a.

The phonology, morphology,and syntax of each language are examined with emphasis on structurally important or typologi-cally interesting features. The description of Makah is based mostly on field data collected inNeah Bay, Washington by the author. Nuuchahnulth data is drawn from Sapir and Swadesh’s twopublished text collections on the language (Sapir & Swadesh 1939, 1955).","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"

On the same page he alsoclaims “[The Nuuchahnulth phrase] KTbrldFh “the woman” ... is formed from KTbrl`“woman” as a nominalized predicate “the one who is a woman”, with the identifying value thatwould be conferred by an English relative clause.” Referring to Makah, he (1979a: 122) says: “...",[157]
