                      ‘He is not allowed to look’      There are also some other means of expressing negation, e.g. the expression ‘kai ahi? ‘where’
  gives a scolding meaning. There are also other roundabout ways to express negative answers (second
  example):                      Kupm a           il      yul.    Yul kai ahi?

2.7.5.      Modal Adverbs
      In Urim most modal notions are encoded using modal verb + VP/S complement constructions, or
  various serial constructions. One of the negative words explained in the previous section could be
  analyzed as a modal verb; am(p)ur ‘don’t’.
      There are also a few modal adverbs in Urim. Imperatives are encoded with a sentence final modal
  adverb that is cliticized onto the last word of the sentence:                      Kai      o!
                      go       IMP
                      ‘Go!’                      Tepm         kaino      om

                      ‘Let us go now!’         Permissive imperative is encoded with repeating the predicate at the beginning of the sentence:                      Kai        kitn      kai    o!
                      go         2sg       go     IMP
                      ’You may go now!’ or ‘Okay, go now!’
                                                                                                     78    Urim also has two modal adverbs that are used to encode probability; pilpa ‘perhaps, must be’ and
kol ‘possibly’. The word kol also has several other usages; therefore it will be described in more
detail in Section 5.6. It is commonly used in conditional or other clauses where the event or action is
less probable. It is not used when the condition is considered a fact or at least quite possible.","[77, 78]"

to mark the construction as a phrase, and it also has the semantical meaning ‘with’ (see also section
4.5.2.2). These phrases often function as adverbials in the sentence :                  Kiin        kipman-en

Disjunctive nominal phrases

in questions. Here we only present some examples of it conjoining noun phrases. Other uses of aki

                      ‘Is she sick or what is wrong? Did she get malaria or what?’3.4. What is Verb Phrase in Urim?
        The term verb phrase is used in two senses. ‘Traditionally, it refers to a group of verbs which
    together have the same syntactic function as a single verb (is coming, may be coming, get up to). In
    such phrases, one verb is the main verb and the others are subordinate to it. In generative grammar,
    the verb phrase has a much broader definition, being equivalent to the whole of the predicate of a
    sentence’ (Crystal pp.325-326).
        In this grammar the different types of predicates will be described later in the Chapter 4 ‘Urim
    Basic Clause Types’. If we follow the traditional definition of verb phrase, most serial phrases do fit
    the definition, but not all of them. Many serial verb phrases function syntactically as prepositions.
    Negation and some modality could possibly be described as part of verb phrase, but the scope of most
    modal particles is rather the whole clause or sentence than verb phrase. Therefore it might be better to
    leave the whole term ‘verb phrase’ out of Urim grammar.. Serial structures have already been
    described in the sections 3.2.7 and 3.3.6. The grammatical functions commonly expressed in
    languages within verb phrases, like negation, modality and time, have been partly described earlier
    (3.2.2.) but we will shortly discuss them here too.
  3.4.1.   Negation
        Negation is usually considered part of verb phrase. In Urim the verbal negator ake normally
    occurs immediately before the verb (or serial verb phrase), but is often also placed first in the clause,
    especially in answers:                      Kil          ake         kul
                      3sg          NEG         come
                      ’She did not come.’                      Kalpis,       ake         kil    ari
                      no           NEG         3sg    see
                      ’No, he did not see (it)’
        Also non-verbal equative and descriptive clauses are negated with the word ake. Existence
    clauses and verbless possessive clauses instead are negated using the word kalpis(en):
                                                                                                     147                   Ake            wang       a   kai
                   NEG            time       REL go
                   ’It is not time to go yet.’                   Kupm         ake        kipman
                   1sg          NEG        man
                   ’I am not a man’                   Kipman        a -kupm-en         ake wail
                   man           G-1sg -ATR         NEG big                   Kupm         kipman     kalpisen
                   1sg          man        not
                   ’I have no husband’                   Kupm         ake        yul      rmpa
                   1sg          NEG        fish     lie
                   ’I do not have fish’     Obligations are negated by ampake’should not’, akentiwe ‘cannot’, and am(p)ur ‘don’t’. Also the
  combination ake mpa is often used in negative exhortations. All these occur first in the clause.
  Akentive can be interpreted as a idiomatized phrase (ake antive ‘not enough/able’). All these
  expressions are more like clause adverbs than parts of verb phrase.","[144, 145, 146, 147]"
"
    The important notion of transitivity distinguishes the two most common basic clause types in any
language: intransitive and transitive clauses. There are degrees of transitivity in clauses, since the
notion of transitivity is a graded continuum (Givon 1984: 98, 152-157). In the prototypical, highly
transitive clause the subject referent is a volitional, controlling agent or a non-volitional cause/effector
                                                                                                                          154and the object is a concrete, result-registering effect or patient. Many objects are less than
prototypical
    In Urim certain clause types have an intermediate degree of transitivity, and are therefore called
here semitransitive. Clearly transitive verb stems are not as common in Urim as in many other
languages. Many verbs can have both transitive (or semitransitive) and intransitive (or reflexive) uses
( 1a), (1b), with no morphologically marking to indicate a change in transitivity. In Urim transitive
verbs are often derived from intransitive ones via addition of the transitive suffixes -en or -e.3. These
suffixes can increase the transitivity of an intransitive verb or clause, making it transitive or
semitransitive (1a), (1c). They can also change semitransitive verbs into fully transitive verbs.
Consider the following examples:
        (1a)     Kil       hokg rmpa             nung.
                 3sg       sleep lie.R           log
                 ‘He slept on a log.’                                            (intransitive)        (1b)     Kil     hokg-en wakg.
                 3sg     sleep-TR fire
                 ‘He slept by the fire.’                         (semitransitive - result of a productive rule)        (1c)     Kil         hokg          kiin.
                 3sg         sleep         woman
                 ‘He had sex with a woman.’                      (transitive)
        (2a)     Kupm            angko           ya.
                 1sg             fall.R          road
                 ‘I fell off the path. (into a ditch)’           (semitransitive)        (2b)     Kwei        ur             angko-wen            manto.
                 thing       ID             fall.R -TR           pig
                 ‘Something attacked the pig.’                   (transitive - derivational)
        (3a)     Warim      hakg.
                 child      cry
                 ‘The child cries’.                                              (intransitive)        (3b)     Warim hakg eng                 wayu.
                 child    cry      PUR          taro
                 ‘The child cries for taro.’                     (intermediate degree of transitivity)
3 The suffix -en is much more common and occurs with all kinds of intransitive verbs, while the suffix -e increases the
transitivity of motion verbs only and occurs more frequently as a continuative aspect marker.
                                                                                                        155       (3b)       Warim hakg-en yan.
                  child     cry-TR      father
                  ‘Child cries after father.’                     (transitive - inflectional)4.2. Intransitive Clauses
        The basic difference between transitive and intransitive clauses is that an intransitive verb has
    only one obligatory argument, whereas a transitive verb has two or more obligatory arguments. In
    Urim the difference between obligatory and optional nominal constituents of the clause is quite
    consistently reflected in the surface structure. The obligatory constituents are almost always
    morphologically unmarked noun phases (no prepositions, no markings on the verb), whereas optional
    constituents are usually expressed as prepositional phrases. There are only a few exceptions to this
    rule. With certain verbs the second obligatory NP in the clause ( the second argument of the verb) is
    morphologically unmarked when it is a pronoun, but requires a preposition when it is a full noun
    phrase. These verbs are probably on the borderline between transitive and intransitive verbs Thus
    far only a few verbs of this type have been found.           (4a)   Tu           wakrongen-tetn.
                  3pl          like  - 2sg.O
                  ‘They like you.’           (4b)   Tu      wakrongen        eng          mansan
                  3pl     like             PUR          parents
                  ‘They love their parents’
       The subject of an intransitive clause always occurs before the verb and can exhibit almost any
    semantic role. In this respect intransitive clauses differ from all other clause types in Urim.           (5a)   Hu             awe             wail             paipm.
                  water          rain.R          big              bad
                  ‘It’s raining hard.’           (5b)   Nampa           haru.
                  dog             bark
                  ‘The dog barks.’
           (5c)   Hapm       plalng.
                  cloth      finished
                  ‘There are no more clothes left.’           (5d)   Tu           warim          akatnong.
                  3pl          child          play.R
                  ‘The children are playing.’
                                                                                                                         156
      In Urim the subject noun phrase is obligatory in all basic clause types. Even expressions
  describing natural phenomena which in many languages have no semantic or surface subjects, or have
  a ‘dummy’ subject (like the it in English it rains) require overt subjects in Urim (5a). In text clauses,
  however, subjects are often absent as the result of ellipsis, when the identity of the subject referent is
  clear from the previous context.
4.2.1.     Time Clauses
      There are two structurally peculiar types of clause that could be described as subtypes of the
  intransitive clause. One of them, which is here called the time clause, consists of one element only;
  a noun phrase denoting time of day. The reasons why these words are not considered lexical verbs
  are: 1) these time words do not have any case frame with arguments, in other words, the time clause
  never has any other obligatory elements except the time word itself, which functions both as the
  subject and the predicate of the clause. 2) In Urim nouns and verbs do not usually have the same
  morphological form in the lexicon (like English ‘love’ or ‘fish’ for example), although verbs and verb
  phrases can easily be nominalized without any formal marking. 3) Another reason fro classifying time
  words as nouns is that adjectives can be formed from them by the suffix –et. This is rare with verbs.
  4) Aspectual, temporal, and modal particles can occur in this time clause the same way as in verbal
  clauses. This is possible, because they do not belong to the verbal morphology but are clausal
  particles.
      Time words also resemble verbs semantically more closely than most other nouns, since the
  points of time are not actually fixed units but processes. Normally nouns represent the most
  permanent states, verbs the most rapidly changing states, and adjectives are somewhere in between
  (Givon 1979a: 265-266).4
      The time clause is fairly common in texts but is sometimes difficult to differentiate from
  dislocations.
          (6a)      Kong,      atom          men                   kai.
                    morning    then          1pl.Exc               go
                    ‘When the morning came, we left’           (6b)     Mining       ise.
                    dark/night PERF
                    ‘The night has fallen/ It has become dark.’
  4 In Urim time is not associated with location like in many other languages (Lyons 1977:669). No locative prepositions
  appear in time adverbials; instead the verb ak ‘do’ is used. This word is used also as the instrumental and manner phrase
  marker.

4.2.2.   Clauses Predicating Existence
      Another subtype of intransitive clause, the existence clause, is also common in the texts. It
  usually takes the same sort of posture verbs as the locative clause as predicates, but does not have any
  locative object. Another difference from locative clauses (described in the section 6.4.2) is that the
  negative form of existence clause is always verbless, and it is possible to omit the verb in some
  positive existence clauses as well. Verbal clauses are negated using the verbal negative particle ake
  (see example 7d), but in a negated existence clause the nominal negative word kalpis is used instead,
  and the verb is missing.
         (7a)    Men     kai-nar      ari      nangnang pa kalpis.
                 1pl.Exc go-descend but        singsing    D not
                 ‘We went down but there was no singsing-feast’     (7b)        Kitn        yul                rmpa?           Yul            rmpa          pa!
                 2sg         fish               lie.R           fish           lie.R         D.EMP
                 ‘Do you have any fish?                          ‘Yes, I do have some fish.’         (7c)    Kitn        yul                rmpa?           Yul             kalpis!
                 2sg         fish               lie.R           fish            not
                 ‘Do you have any fish?                          ‘There is no fish!’     (7d)        Kupm      ake            yul           rmpa!
                 1sg       NEG            fish          lie.R
                 ‘I do not have fish!’
      Another special feature of this clause type is that the subject can easily occur after the verb. In
  other intransitive clauses this is very rare and probably impossible in other clause types.","[153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"
"4.5.2.   Descriptive Clause
       The predicate of a descriptive clause differs from the predicate of an equative clause in that it is
  non-referential. It only qualifies and describes the subject-referent. The predicate can either be a
  nominal phrase as in an equative clause, or an adjectival phrase. The word order is inflexible - the
  result would be either unintelligible or an equative clause with different meaning. The subject is
  almost always definite and therefore marked by the demonstrative pa, or a pronoun (22c). Without
  this demonstrative the clause would look like an attributive noun phrase. Compare the following two
  examples:         (21a)   Melnum         pa          wor.
                 man            D           good
                 ‘The man      is good/well.’
         (21b)   Melnum         wor
                 man            good
                 ‘A good man’
                                                                                                         166    Other examples of descriptive clauses:
           (22a)   Namung       pa       okopma wor.
                   banana       D        food   good
                   ‘Banana is good food.’

                   ‘Tingkorin was a man, Ariyek was a tree kangaroo.’

                   ‘This is not a bus, this is a truck!’4.6. Topic Clauses
        The notion of ‘topic’ is basically a textual notion, not a syntactic function in the clause. In Urim
    textual topics and left dislocations are a very common discourse device. Some of these sentential
    topics seem to have been lexicalized into fixed, obligatory parts of certain types of clauses. The status
    of these as basic clause types is somewhat marginal the same kind of topicalization structures also
    occur as productive discourse devices. Nevertheless, it seems that certain verbs in Urim require an
    obligatory argument, which can be called topic. Li-Thompson calls these kinds of structures ‘double-
    subject constructions’ (Li 1975: 481). The name conveys the idea that in these constructions the
    prototypical features of subject have been split into two constituents: topic and grammatical subject.
    Subject is prototypically what the clause is about and also the actor in control in transitive clauses-
    especially so in Urim (see section 6.4.4). If there is a lack of control in the situation expressed by a
    transitive clause, there are usually also some changes in the morphosyntax of the clause. One of these
    changes is to move the agent to the clause initial topic position and promote some other referent into
    the grammatical subject. In Urim culture certain types of actions are always considered to be outside
    of the control of the person involved. Emotions and sensations, as well as most sicknesses are
    expressed by verb frames requiring topic arguments. Possession is considered not fully controlled by
                                                                                                                          167
  the individual possessor, and for this reason also possessive clauses are topic clauses.9 In topic clauses
  both nominal constituents, topic and subject, precede the verb when it is present, but the verb itself
  may be omitted too.
4.6.1.     Possessive Clause
      In the possessive clause the semantic possessor occurs in topic position and the possessed item
  occurs as grammatical subject. This is thematically consistent with the normal ordering of
  information in the clause, since the referent of the possessor is usually given information, and the
  thing possessed is new information. Since there is no agreement morphology on the verb to show
  which NP is the grammatical subject, only word order and semantic content reveal it. The word order
  seems to be fixed; the topic and the subject cannot change places in the clause. One example was
  found where the subject appeared to occur between the two parts of an appositional topic noun phrase
  (23e). The possessor is usually animate, and most often human. Possessive clause may have a verb
  denoting the position of the possessed object. There are both verbal and verbless possessive clauses,
  but positive possessive clauses are more frequently verbal. The verb seems to be obligatory if there
  is another nominal constituent in the clause. Possessive clauses structurally resemble three other
  clause types: equative clauses (23b), existence clauses (23e) and locative clauses (23a).
          (23a)     Melnum        pa      hi       itna    wam.
                    man           D       sore     stand.R hand
                    ‘The man has a sore in the hand.’
          (23b)     Kil           kiin              wekg.
                    3sg           woman             two
                    ‘He has two wifes.’
          (23c)     melnum       ur     pa       wan   okipma watipmen.
                    person       ID     D        house food   plenty
                    ‘A certain man has plenty food in his house.’
                     or: ‘There is a man with plenty food in his house’
          (23d)     Kupm           wan              kalpis-en.
                    1sg            house            not-ATR
                    ‘I have no house.’
          (23e)     Kitn           nerkgiin         Klimanglen       kalpis.
                    2sg            gardenland       Klimanglen       not
                    ‘You Klimanglen have no garden land (here).’
  9 Foster (in Plank 1979) discusses the notion of possession in different cultures and how it affects the structure of
  possessive clauses.
                                                                                                                            168
      The possessive clause is negated differently from most other clause types. Instead of the usual
  negative particle ake the nominal negative word kalpis is used and there is no verb.10 Elsewhere,
  only existence clauses are negated in this way (see Section 6.3.2). There are two other features shared
  between existence clauses and possessive clauses: 1) use of the same verbs, and 2) the existence of
  verbless variants. It might be possible to derive some types of possessive clause from an existence
  clause or a locative clause by adding a topic, but the structure is fully grammaticalized and the topic is
  obligatory.
4.6.2.     Experience Clause
      The topic of an experience clause is also always animate and semantically an experiencer. The
  grammatical subject is usually either a body part, where the feeling etc. is located, or an inanimate
  referent which is the cause of the feeling or the object of wanting etc. The only common features
  such clauses exhibit are: 1) the semantic meaning of involuntary experience, and 2) the presence of an
  obligatory topic constituent before the grammatical subject. Most experience clauses have a bound
  object pronoun which is coreferential with the topic (24a), (24d), but this pronoun can be absent,
  especially if the grammatical subject is a body part of the experiencer (24b), (24c).
      The experience clauses with body parts differ structurally from genitive constructions, which are
  always of the form Npossessed + a + Ngenitive (wam a melnum ‘man’s hand’) when the possessor is
  specific (see section 3.1.4).
          (24a)     Kupm        hu         wak-opm.
                    1sg         water      ?-1sg.O
                    ‘I am thirsty.’
          (24b)     Kupm        ake        num       wakget,       kalpis.
                    1sg         not        skin      hot           not
                    ‘I do not have fever.’
          (24c)     Kupm         ok               kark(-opm).
                    1sg          mouth            afraid(-1sg.O)
                    ‘I feel nauseated’          (24d)     Kitn     yaprekg       paipm-en-tetn?
                    2sg      breath        bad-ATR-2sg.O
                    ‘Are you out of breath?’
  10 Although no instances of possessive clauses having the negative word ake have been found thus far, it remains a
  possibility that such a construction could exist. If this were to be the case, clauses negated with ake might have a slightly
  different meaning (perhaps having to do with scope of negation) than those negated with kalpis.
                                                                                                          169
       In contrast to the possessive clause, the experience clause is normally negated using the verbal
    negator ake.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169]"

    Urim is a non-Austronesian language spoken in Papua New Guinea. Laycock (1973) classifies it as a
    stock-level isolate of the Torricelli Phylum. It is spoken by about 3400 people, who live in 16 villages
    in the southern foothills of the Torricelli Mountains. Twelve of the villages are located south of the
    Sepic Highway, and one is north of the highway, in the Maprik Sub-District of East Sepik Province. The
    remaining three of the villages are located west of the Bongos River in the Nuku Sub-District of the
    West Sepik Province. The villages west of the Bongos River speak the Kukwo dialect, and the villages
    east of the Bongos River speak the main Urim dialect (also called Yangkolen by the Kukwo people).
    The Urim language has also been called Kalp, which comes from the word kalpm ‘no’ in the Kukwo
    dialect.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"
"    This far it seems that only pake occurs in following cases:    1) When the two clauses express contrastive comparison, either in quantity or in quality or on
positive-negative.",[214]
"                      Kitn uwi         kil aki       kitn   uwi     pa?

                      ‘Do you take this or that one?’
      Sometimes an additional occurrence of aki at the end of the sentence expresses doubt or hesitation
  (the speaker is not sure about the right alternative):
                                                                                                        211                        Tu       urai,    Yakimping aki, Repulp aki...

                        ‘The strangers, from Yakimping, or perhaps from Repulp,...’
     Quite often aki occurs in questions in the final position either alone or together with kalpis ‘no’.
  The combination aki kalpis also often expresses accusation or other negative attitude;
                        Kil     kai ise         aki?
                        3sg     go PERF         or

5.5.4.      Adversative / Contrastive conjunctions: ari and pake
      Urim has two adversative or contrasting conjunctions: ari and pake. Their uses seem to overlap at
  least partly, although there are cases when the native speakers accept only the other one.                  ari                          expresses a change, sometimes unexpected.
                                               contraexpectation
            ari   kalpis         emphatic contraexpectation

                                         limitation
Ari - contrast and surprise
    Ari is the most common contrastive conjunction. Its function is to mark contrast or
contraexpectation. Typically there is an unexpected event or sudden (especially negative) surprise,
sometimes just some new turn of story. Sometimes ari just marks the change of actor or speaker in
discussion, especially if the speaker answers negatively or otherwise against expectations.","[210, 211, 212]"

4.1. Introduction and Chart of Clause Types
        The clause is the basic syntactic unit occurring between the phrase and the sentence.1 When
    describing the clauses of a language, it is important to clearly distinguish between the notions of text
    clause and basic or kernel clause. Text clauses consist of both nuclear and peripheral elements, and
    quite often some of the nuclear elements are not present in the clause if they are known from the
    textual context or environmental context or are part of the semantic content of the verb. A basic
    clause consists of nuclear elements only and is a ‘perfect’ or ‘full’ clause in the sense that it does not
    have any elided constituents and it can be understood without a text context. Generative grammar
    defines kernel clauses or sentences as being minimal in the sense that they cannot be derived from
    other clauses. This excludes passive, imperative, interrogative etc. types from basic clause types.
    (Lyons 1979, Givon 1984)
        Nuclear elements of the clause are the predicate, which is usually a verb, and its obligatory or core
    arguments. In nonverbal clauses the NP or adjective phrase functions as the predicate. In Urim a
    clause can minimally consist of only a single predicative noun phrase. Basic clauses consisting only
    of a verb are not allowed2, although this kind of text clause is very common as the result of ellipsis
    and clause chaining. All clauses can also have various types of optional adjuncts: accompaniment,
    instrument, time, location, reason, etc. In Urim the number of optional elements in a clause is usually
    restricted to at most two. The occurrence of these is semantically determined, and does not affect the
    description of the basic clause types.
     Chart of Urim Basic Clause Types
    Name                                                             Constituents                    Functions    1 This chapter is an unpublished paper written 1991.
    Many grammars talk about predication types instead of clause types, but we have chosen this traditional way of
    structuralist grammars to describe these basic syntactic structures of Urim. Also the ideas of dependence grammar have
    been used when describing Urim clause types.
    2 Some languages allow basic clause types without any ‘proper’ semantic or grammatical subject. For example, in
    Finnish the clause Sataa ‘It rains’ consists only of a verb without any semantic subject or subject NP on the surface,
    although the verb has third person singular Subject indexing inflection.. The corresponding clause in English has a
    semantically ‘empty’ subject it. In Urim these kinds of structures are not possible, unless the structure called here the
    time clause is interpreted as having a verb instead of a noun as the only constituent (see section 4.7).

    The following criteria have been used here to determine the basic clause types in Urim:
    -     1) How many obligatory arguments does the verb have? This is the main criterion. The
          presence or absence of a verb is often also used as the main criterion for dividing clauses
          into types. While Urim has both verbal and nonverbal clause types, there are also some
          minor types where the verb is optional or is deleted when negated. Therefore the presence
          of the verb is only used as a secondary criterion in determining Urim basic clause types.
    -     2) What are the syntactic functions (subject, object etc) and the semantic roles (agent,
          patient etc) of the arguments of the verb?
    -      3) Clause types may also have special syntactic features such as word order, negative
          form, case morphology etc. These, along with the meaning of the clause, have been used
          here only as secondary criteria in separating clause types.","[151, 152, 153]"
"        The semantic role of the transitive subject is almost exclusively that of agent. This means that
    usually only animate referents occur as subjects of transitive clauses. Agents are prototypically
    animate, volitional and active causes of an action. In Urim forces of nature and moving machines can
    also frequently occur as transitive subjects. When other, less prototypical kinds of inanimate entities
    occur as transitive subjects there are usually some morphological changes in the clause: the ultimate
    agent occurs as clause topic at the beginning (16b), or an instrumental serialization with the verb ak
    ’do’ is used(16a).8
            (16a)    Hu       kop       ak         almpen              yo.
                     water    river     use.R      turn.around.R       tree
                     ‘The flooded river carried trees away.’
            (16b)    Mowal        ko        angket-el.
                     Mowal        axe       cut.R -2sg.O
                     ‘Mowal (accidentally) cut himself with an axe.’        In example (16b) the actor hurts himself accidentally. In this case the instrument usually appears
    as the subject and the actor as the object of the clause
        A number of examples are now given of normal transitive clauses with clause initial subjects
    bearing the semantic role of agent. Transitive clauses can also have an optional indirect object, which
    is usually marked by the preposition eng or the affix -n on the verb (underlined).

                 ‘I am going to buy myself some clothes.’
4.4.2.   Ditransitive Clauses
      Transitive clauses can be divided into two subgroups in Urim: monotransitive and ditransitive
  clauses. There are relatively few verbs that require three obligatory arguments. The semantic role of
  the third argument can be benefactive or recipient and sometimes also locative or instrumental. The
  ditransitive subtype is here defined purely on a structural basis. Optional benefactives etc. are almost
  always marked by the preposition eng, which is reduced into a suffix -n occurring between the verb
  and direct object, if the direct object is a personal pronoun (17d), (17e). Obligatory benefactives etc.
  are morphologically unmarked.
      In some cases the border between obligatory and optional third argument is not clear
  morphologically. If the verb already has a suffix -en, there will be no other suffix -n as the result of
  dative shift (17 f). Certain verbs behave sometimes like ditransitive verbs, sometimes like mono-
  transitives; compare examples (18c) and (18d). The example (18d) is monotransitive since the
  locative phrase kai ampei cannot occur without the preposition. This shows the same kind of
  phenomena of gradual transitivity that was discussed earlier in the section 2.         (18a) Kil        plan -to           wan.

                   ‘They           blamed me without cause.’
           (18e)   Tu      ik    -en       hu          kuntuk.
                   3pl     do.IR-TR        water       pot
                   ‘They pour water into the pot.’4.5. Nominal Clauses
        The nominal clause consists of two nominal phrases or a nominal phrase and an adjective phrase.
    No overt copula occurs linking the subject/topic noun phrase and the nominal or adjectival predicate.
    There are two types of nominal clauses: equative and descriptive.
        A negative nominal clause is formed by the verbal negation word ake (22e) even if there is no
    verbal predicate. This distinguishes the nominal clause from the possessive clause, which sometimes
    looks similar (23d).
  4.5.1.   Equative Clause
        The equative clause has two noun phrases as obligatory constituents; both denote the same
    referent. If the order of these noun phrases is changed, the first NP automatically becomes the
    subject of the clause and the meaning of the clause often changes too - this means that the word order
    of this clause type is very rigid. Consider the following examples:
           (19a)   Wail     pa        kipman          a-kupm-en.
                   big      that      man             G-1sg-ATR
                   ‘That big one is my husband.’
           (19b)   Kipman          a-kupm-en          pa            wail.
                   man             G-1sg-ATR          D             big
                   ‘My husband is a big man.’
        The subject of an equative clause is nearly always given information and is therefore marked as
    definite by the demonstrative pa. Pa ‘that’ and ti ‘this’ also frequently function as demonstrative
    pronouns and encode the subjects of equative and descriptive clauses. In other clause types this
                                                                                                         165
  pronominal function is very rare - at least there are no examples of it in the text material used here as
  data. A possible reason for this might be the potential for confusion with the numerous instances of
  pa and ti functioning as conjunctions and discourse markers in more complex sentences. In the
  structural simple nominal clauses, there is less possibility of confusion between the various functions
  of these demonstrative forms. The equative clause can, contrary to the descriptive clause, also have
  proper noun phrases or pronouns as predicates (20a), (20b). Quite often equative clause consists of
  one nominal phrase only (20d). In this case the subject pronoun has been deleted.         (20a)   Waring ti,      yikal              pa.
                 betel  this/her bow                that/there

    Ari seems to more often mark negative rather than positive changes or surprises in the story. This
tendency is highlighted in the way it combines with the negator kalpis to emphasize even more the
negative nature of the surprising event. The combination ari kalpis is commonly used in narrative
texts to indicate a turning point of a story.","[212, 213]"
"     The most common and probably basic function of ur is to mark indefiniteness ‘a, one’ (in
negative clauses ‘any’). Ur is commonly used to introduce new referents to the text, but not every
time. Ur is used in the following cases:
     - when it is important to know the number of referents introduced, but the context or other
modifiers do not tell it. For this reason ur is almost always used when persons are introduced. Often
it can be glossed ‘one’ like the numeral uris, but the numeral does not have the function of
introducing new referents. Even if the numeral occurs, ur is still required to show that a new referent
is being introduced (see the first example below).",[87]

    Kalpis is used to negate non-verbal existence and possessive clauses, occurring at the end of the
clause. It frequently takes the attributive suffix -en. Kalpis (or sometimes a’a) is also used to answer
yes/no questions and at the end of the clause to strengthen the ake negation of the clause.","[75, 76]"

      The existence clause often has the same thematic functions as certain left dislocations in Urim and
  the existential clause in English; it is used to introduce new items to the text. This explains also why
  the subject in this clause type can move so easily after the verb. The position after the verb is
  universally the place of new information in the clause, and in existential clauses the subject usually is

    new information, while in other clause types it is usually given information. The following examples
    illustrate how existence clauses and left dislocation are used the same way to introduce main
    participants at the beginning of a text. They also show how difficult it is sometimes to tell the
    difference between left dislocation and existence clause.

                   ‘There was a mother and a child. The mother sent the child on an errand
                    saying ...’
        The expression man warim wekg pa here is a verbless existence clause. It cannot be interpreted
    as a left dislocation because of the conjunction atom ‘then’ between it and the next clause.           (9b)    Walmamikg      yek-wekg      pa      ekg         rpma,

                   then        spirit       D      go-ascend
                   ‘There was a grandfather and grandson, then a ghost went upriver....’        The underlined part of the sentence here is interpreted as an existence clause with verb.
           (9c)    Wusok wail        wekg pa, ekg kai            miring ...
                   small   big       two     D    two go         mission
                   ‘There were two brothers who went to the mission station ...’
        This is a typical case of a left dislocation introducing the main participants in the story. The
    dislocation is typically set off intonationally, so that a pause occurs between it and the main clause.","[157, 158]"

      The word atnen appears to be morphologically composed of the verb itna (atna) ‘stand’ and
  transitive suffix -en. Like eng, it is basically a preposition. When a clause follows this preposition, a
  relative clause marker (?) a is usually added after it (atnen a). This shows that all occurrences of
  atnen should probably be analyzed as a preposition having either a NP or a nominalized clause as the
  head. Semantically, atnen (a) usually refers to the reason for something bad happening.",[194]

About the uses of pa occurring before pause
     Most Urim conjunctions can occur in two phonological positions, either before a pause
intervening between two clauses or after it. When a conjunction occurs before the pause, it is always
pronounced with a distinctive rising intonation, and often its final vowel, or syllable (also the final
nasal can be lengthened!) is lengthened as well. The placing of a conjunction before pause does not
basically change its meaning, but makes it more emphatic, for example expressing surprise. Quite
often prepausal pa is subordinating, with the potential for being interpreted as ‘when’, ‘because’, or
‘if’. In Urim pa conjunction occurring before a pause can have a causative, conditional, or temporal
                                                                                                     226
interpretation. Possibly there is no clear-cut difference between causatives and conditionals in Urim,
as far as the use of pa goes. When the speaker wants to express that the reason etc. is uncertain or
hypothetical, he adds irrealis mood and/or the particle kol to the clause.
    Conditional clauses are clauses whose semantic role is the expression of hypotheses or conditions
(Crystal 1980). There are some similarities between topics and conditionals. In many languages both
may be marked by similar morphemes. This is also true in Urim - one of the main functions of pa is
to mark topicalized constituents.
    The conjunction pipa is more common in conditional constructions than pa, especially in written
texts (see section 5. 5. 6. 4).","[225, 226]"

    Torricelli phylum languages have been thought to be basically Papuan languages which have been
subjected to heavy Austronesian influence. There are some Austronesian languages along the north
coast. Word order is one of the Austronesian features in the Torricelli language group, since Papuan
languages usually are SOV- languages. It is a common theory that SVO- languages often have
developed from earlier SOV-languages either through the influence of some neighbouring SOV-
languages or from language internal reasons. One of these reasons could be the disappearance of
morphological case-marking, which in a way forces the language to rely on the word order in marking
these functions. (Givón 1979a 145-146). If a language were to change its word order from SOV to
SVO, it would be expected that there would be some residues from the former SOV-type structure.
The more recent this change has been, the more residues would be expected. Word order change
most commonly starts from the main-clause level, and later spreads into more complex structures.
According to Givón (1984:220-228). “the longer a language has maintained a rigid OV or VO word
order, the more it is likely to bear out Greenberg’s predictions (1966).” If this is true, then Urim has
been SVO-language at least during the last two thousand years, since it is an unusually pure SVO-
language following all the predictions that Greenberg mentions. All modifiers of the noun phrase and
almost the entire verb phrase occur after the head. There are suffixes, but this is quite a common
feature in SVO-languages in general, and not a strong indicator of a recent change of word order.
Most commonly the residue of the presumed word order would occur in dependent and embedded
clauses and other structures like nominalizations and idioms. But in Urim these have SVO-word
order, except when the subject referent is generic:
       (27)   Kil    ariwe    hapm        angkut.
              3sg    know.R cloth         sew.R
              ‘She knows how to sew.’
    This is the only observed possible residue of a former SOV-word order. Assuming this theory is
right Urim is an almost ideal SVO-language typologically. One could perhaps question if it were
easier to derive a language like Urim from an Austronesian group having some heavy Papuan

influences than the other way around? But this and the whole question of the classification of Urim
needs much more work before any definite answers or even suggestions can be given.
                                                                                                          172                               5. Complex sentences        Usually three types of subordinate clauses are distinguished in languages: those which function as
    arguments of the predicate (i.e. complements), those which function as modifiers of nouns (relative
    clauses), and those which function as modifiers of verb phrases or entire propositions (adverbial
    clauses). (Thompson and Longacre, 171). We can find these clause types also in Urim, although with
    adverbial clauses it is difficult to distinguish between subordinated adverbial clauses and more
    coordinate combinations of clauses. Therefore we conflate the description of adverbial clauses and
    coordinate combinations of sentences.","[170, 171, 172]"

2.9. Demonstratives
        There are four demonstratives. Each of these can have both referential and psychological uses.
    All can also be used to refer to time and as parts of pro-adverbs. The basic deictic functions of these
    demonstratives are as follows:
     ti      ‘this, here’ indicates physical nearness to the speaker, to the hearer, or to both. It can also
             indicate psychological nearness to the speaker.
     pa      ‘that, there’ indicates a referent that is some distance away from the speaker, the hearer, or both.
             The referent is usually near enough to be seen. Pa can also signal an indefinite distance.
     ai      ‘far away, over there, somewhere’ is phonetically a clitic, but native speakers usually write it
             separately. Ai indicates that a referent is relatively far away from both the speaker and hearer.
             The referent is usually not near enough to be seen. Ai also often indicates an indefinite spatial
             or temporal distance.
     kil     ‘3sg; this, here’ marks physical or psychological nearness and is sometimes used instead of ti
             when referring to humans or animals, or when the proximity of a referent is emphasized. Kil is
             basically a third person singular pronoun with its use as demonstrative pronoun being secondary
             (see section 2.4).","[87, 88, 89, 90]"

                    ’Can I get it later of not?’
3.4.3.   Modal particles
    Imperatives and the clitic –o(m)
      Imperative modus is in Urim optionally expressed by using the clause-final imperative clitic –o.
  In imperative clause the verb or verbs are always in irrealis mode. Sometimes this clitic occurs in the
  form –om, which adds the meaning ‘now’ (possibly shortened from am ’now’). Imperative clitic is
  always attached to the last word of the clause or sentence:                    Wrekg          o!
                    rise           IMP
                    ’Get up!’                    Kitn    ti        wrekg        eng   ekg   kai       om!
                    2sg     here      get.up       OBL   1dual go        IMP.now
                    ’Get up and lets go!’
                                                                                                    149                  Ikor        nung        o!
                  search.IR   wood        IMP
                  ‘Get firewood!’                  Mentepm       kaino     anong        o -m!
                  1pl.Inc       go up     village      IMP-now                  Hu            ti        watet o!
                  water         this      red     IMP
                  ’Let this water be red!’ (incantation)                  Mehen         o!
                  carefully     IMP
                  ’Be carefull!’ (notice that mehen is an adverb!)
    As the examples above show, in imperative clauses the subject may or may not appear on the
surface. Reason is pragmatical, since Urim verbs do not encode person or plurality.
    Following examples show that the clitic –o appears only once in the sentence:                  Kipmekg     pa        il     mpa kaino             o!
                  2dual       D         eat.IR FUT go                IMP
                  ’You two eat and go then!’                  Kirpo      pa        il         yangkipm           hute       elngen   o!
                  grab.IR    D         eat.IR     talk               straight   stop     IMP
                  ’Take heed of this straight talk and stop it!’                  Am kai uwi     nep       mangkon ur iye         kul     elk -opm il
                  now go get.IR coconut green        ID carry.IR come give-1sgO drink.IR
                  o!
                  IMP
                  ‘Now go get some green coconuts and bring me to drink!’
    Permissive imperative is encoded repeating the verb (possibly only the verb kai ‘go’, since no
other examples have been found this far) at the beginning of the clause. In this type of imperative the
personal pronoun is obligatory::                  Kai        kitn         kai       om
                  go         2sg          go        IMP.now
                  ’You may go now!’                  Kai     kitn iye              eng        al-kitn   o!
                  go      2sg    carry.IR       PBL        G-2sg     IMP
                  ’You can keep it!’    Imperatives can be expressed also without the particle –o. Possibly this is a weaker or ‘more
polite’ way to express orders and wishes.
                                                                                                        150                    Kitn        kul             ingkliin-topm!

                    You two, fetch some water for me to drink!’
      Other modal particles
      Urim also has two modal adverbs that are used to encode probability; pilpa ‘perhaps, must be’ and
  kol ‘possibly’. Both occur sentence initially, and hardly can be considered part of a verb phrase. The
  word kol also has several other usages; therefore it will be described in more detail in Section 5.6.
  Pilpa has been described earlier in Section 3.2.2.
3.4.4.   Serial structures
      Serial structures are formally of four types: coordinated, subordinated with main verb last,
  subordinated with main verb first, and preposition-like serials. The functions of serial structures are
  very various.","[148, 149, 150]"
"    Consider the following examples:
                                                                                                        196                  Tu     la     intokg         okipma              il.

                  ‘You know how to make and eat good food’
                  tu        al            rpma
                  3pl       eat.R         sit.R
                  ‘They are eating (at this moment)’       (serial verb encoding imperfective aspect)                  tu      al           pa        rpma
                  3pl     eat.R        C         sit.R
                  ‘They sit/sat eating’ or ‘are/were eating’ (not necessarily at the moment of speaking)
                                                 (clause chain encoding temporal overlap)
                  compare to:
                  tu        rpma        (pa) al.

                  ’They sat down and ate’    On the other hand, it is also often difficult to tell whether a chain of verbs is an idiom or a serial
structure. When a particular combination of verbs is used frequently enough, it gradually comes to be
more lexicalized and idiomatic. Some expressions are somewhere between a serial structure and a
lexeme, others are fully developed into an idiomatic lexeme. The endpoint of the process is when the
combined verbs are phonologically one word and the meaning of the combination is opaque. The
following examples, proceed from verb combinations which are more phrasal and semantically
transparent to those which are more reduced phonologically and/or semantically opaque.                  uwi           iye      kul!

5.4.1.   The four functions of serial verb constructions in Urim
      Serial verb constructions have four functions in Urim. The first function is to encode a single
  complex action or set of commonly co-occurring actions. Serial verbs can also serve as an abbreviated
  way to express purpose and causation. The third function of serial verbs is more grammatical, for
  example adding modal or aspectual meaning to a predication or marking peripheral semantic roles.
  These kind of aspectual or modal verbs have historically developed into full clause particles or
  prepositions and finally lost their verbal meanings altogether in other languages. The fourth function
  of serial verb constructions in Urim is as a means of introducing new lexical items into the language.
  All these types of serialization are very common in Urim.
  Serialized structures expressing a series of closely related events
     Examples of serial verbs encoding a single complex action or series of actions that commonly
  occur together are given below:                   tu     akor      kai   ari         wekg        ham     rpma

  texts, especially in stories:

Serialized structures expressing purpose
    With certain verbs, serialized structures can serve as an abbreviated way of expressing purpose ,
without requiring the oblique preposition eng.","[195, 196, 197, 198]"
"      In speech pa has certain phonetic features that help distinguish its various functions. As a
  conjunction, pa is either preceded or followed by a pause. Native speakers are often unsure about
  where to write the comma in written language. But in spoken language the differences of function
  associated with pre- or post-pausal occurrence of pa are clearer. It is generally the case in the
  language that whenever a conjunction occurs before a pause, it is pronounced with a distinctive rising
  intonation and often its final vowel is also lengthened. This is true for pa as well.
                                                                                                      223
    -     When pa occurs after a pause, it usually functions as a coordinating conjunction linking
          clauses encoding two successive event. Sometimes pa is also used when there is some sort
          of weak causation involved; for example the previous event must occur before the following
          one can happen (time sequence, local connection etc.). The conjunction pa that occurs after
          a pause is usually unstressed, but can be stressed in order to emphasize the temporal or
          causal relationship between the conjoined clauses. When pa is unstressed, it is difficult to
          distinguish it from the coordinative conjunction a, since both can be pronounced and written
          as wa. Still, the fact that these both can occur next to each other in the same clause shows
          that they are separate words (as in the following example).","[222, 223]"

2.7.4.   Negation
      There are two basic negators in Urim: ake ‘not’ (for verbal clauses) and kalpis (for non-verbal
  clauses) (=Kukwo dialect kalpm) ‘no’. Instead of kalpis the more injection-like a’a can also be used.
      The verbal negator ake can occur either immediately before or after the subject (more usual in
  texts), but if the subject is prominent and therefore fronted, then ake always occurs between it and the
  verb. Ake is also used in verbless equative and descriptive clauses.",[75]
"
        Typologically it is a common phenomenon that rigid word order and lack of morphological case
    markings occur together in a language. This is especially common in SVO-languages like Urim.
    Urim does not have any case marking morphology on either the subject or object, nor is there any
    agreement marked on the verb either. Since there is no morphological way to mark which noun
    phrase in the clause is subject and which is object, the syntactic position of the noun phrase before or
    after the verb is what shows its syntactic function. Not only the subject and transitive object are
    unmarked, but also all other obligatory arguments of a verb are morphologically unmarked. This
    increases the importance of word order for delineating the functions of NPs in the clause. The
    following examples illustrate how a change of word order changes the meaning of clauses and even

    Urim has been classified as a Papuan language, stock level isolate in the Torricelli Phylum.. The
question of isolation can be re-considered when some of the neighbouring languages have been
studied in more detail. All Torricelli languages display some similarities with Austronesian
languages: fixed SVO word order, lack of medial verbs, use of transitivity-changing suffixes and
realis-irrealis mood, etc. It seems that Urim has these non-Papuan features to a greater extent than
many other Torricelli languages. It lacks subject-agreement on the verb, and is also in other respects
morphologically simpler than the other Torricelli phylum languages.","[169, 170]"

5.3.5.   Strong reason: eng ntei
      The basic meaning of eng ntei is interrogative ‘why?’; its use to mark strong reasons is secondary.
  Strong reason means here, that the speaker feels an extra need of explanation (answers to a question
  etc.), or wants to emphasize the reason. The expression eng ntei in this use is not very common in
  texts - all examples below are elicited. Its function is much the same as an ordinary rhetoric question,
  which the speaker himself answers. Its use probably reflects the influence of Tok Pisin bilong
  wanem.","[192, 193]"
"      It is a very common phenomenon in languages that deictic pronouns or words derived from
  deictic pronouns also function as conjunctions. It is especially common to have causative
  conjunctions formed out of demonstratives, since they point to textual material as the explanation,
  reason, or basis for what is said.
  The conjunction pa
  The different functions of pa
      The word pa is the commonest word in Urim. In a corpus of 35 texts containing over 28,000
  words pa occurs about 355 times. This corpus contains mostly spoken texts but also some written
  ones. Pa is somewhat less common in written texts. In some clauses the word pa occurs 4 times.
  This is possible because of the many functions of this morpheme. The basic meaning of pa is far
  deictic—‘there’. When it functions as a modifier within a noun phrase, pa usually marks givenness /
  psychological accessibility of a referent to the hearer, but it can also function as a topic marker
  following various sorts of topicalized or left-dislocated constituents indicating a new temporal setting,
  a new or changed topic, or focus. As a phrasal head, pa can have following functions: deictic pronoun
  ‘that’, locative adverb ‘there’, emphatic particle, and conjunction.",[222]

Frequentative Serializations
   The verb anti ‘agree, comply with’ is also used in frequentative serializations with numerals and
quantifiers:                  Karek     kil     la         anti           wraur.

                  ‘How many times have I told you already!’
Reason Serializations
    Serialized constructions with the word (ok)atnen are used to express reason relationships.
Morphologically, it is reminiscent of the two forms ok ‘mouth’ and atnen ‘wait for, watch, hit a
target’. This construction may take either a noun phrase or sentence complement. Usually atnen has
somewhat negative meaning:                  Hu      pa awe perper atnen            tu    alm      nok kai wrik miring-ket.

                  ‘It rains so often because they are making sago at a place where ancestral spirit is

                  ‘You are sick because of the food you ate.’
Distributive Serializations
   The following serial constructions with the verb ak ‘do’ are used to express distribution notions:
akawiye (ak-awi-e, literally ‘do-take-HAB’) and aknirake (ak-nirak-e, literally ‘do-differ-HAB’):                  Melnum pa      ampreing kwap           pa      akawiye warim      pa.

                  ‘One man from each village.’

    Additive Serializations
       There are also two other serialized constructions containing the verb ak ‘do’, They are used to
    express additional notions: aken ‘ to work with, add into’ (ak-en ‘do-with/TR’) and aklanti ‘in
    addition to’ (ak-la-anti ‘do-say-with’):                      Mpa kupm ikor      yul iken /iklanti     nung     eng uwi     hapm

                      ‘I’ll catch fish (and bring it) in addition to the firewood to exchange for clothing.’2.6. Adjectives
        Adjectives are defined as forms that can serve as either: 1) attributive modifiers of nouns within
    the noun phrase, occurring immediately after the head noun and before all other modifiers, or 2) as
    predicates. When adjectives occur as predicates, they never exhibit a realis-irrealis distinction. In
    Urim, it is not usually possible for an adjective to occur in isolation as the head of the noun phrase,
    except in elliptical contexts.","[56, 57, 58]"
"
           The following examples illustrate the use of pa as a demonstrative pronoun:                         Waring       ti,         yikal pa
                         betel nut    this        bow that

                          pa     wonet           paipm
                         that    difficult       bad
                         ‘I would like to learn many kinds of languages, but it is very difficult.’
                                                                                                       91
    Because of its many functions at discourse level the purely demonstrative function of pa is
somewhat restricted in Urim. It can freely occur as independent demonstrative pronoun in most
positions, like the examples above show, but does not often occur as the subject of transitive or
intransitive clauses. The reason is probably that an independent word pa starting a clause could
easily be interpreted as a conjunction. Also it seems, that pa occurring as locative object would be
easily interpreted as emphatic particle. For this reason a deictic adverb is used instead. Compare the
following examples:                  Mentekg     rpma         ti!
                  1dual        sit.R       here

                  C     go     stand.IR go          there
                  ‘Go to stand over there!’                  Tu      awi         wayu        ela       pa
                  3pl     take.R      taro        be.R      there
                  ‘They took that taro’    This last example was elicited. The native speaker did not accept the expression wayu pa in this
clause, possibly because the clause was not part of any context or text. When pa is used with NP, it
almost always marks givenness (refers back to something mentioned in the text or known from the
context) and the demonstrative meaning is bleached. Therefore different combinations of verb + pa
are used instead to make it clear that the speaker refers to location, not to givenness.","[90, 91]"

                      cooked in the house.’        It is common in Urim for words to exhibit more than one syntactic function without any change in
    form to mark the change in category, much like in English e.g. the word fish can function both as a
    noun and a verb. This is especially true with the words that can function as modifiers of noun phrases
    or as predicates. Very often the same word functions both as adjective and adverb in Urim without
    any morphological change, for example such common words as paipm ‘bad; badly’ or wor ‘good;
    well’.
  2.6.1.    Underived Adjectives
        The class of underived adjectives in Urim is comparatively small. As in many other languages,
    the basic, most common adjectives are usually morphologically simple. Semantically these basic
    adjectives encode permanent properties of the entities, such as size, shape, age, or colour. Some of
    the principal underived adjectives in Urim are listed below:           Form                                                           Meaning

being characterized is set off from the predicative adjective by a demonstrative (pa, ti, kil, ai).","[58, 59]"

                  ‘She does not work quickly, but she does good work’    2) Pake is sometimes also used in clauses expressing alternatives or conditions:                  Pisket      kalpis    pake uwi        pret     ur           pa

                  ‘This car will take you to the village, but you must tell the driver first’
    3) The word pake also functions an emphatic particle having scope over either the whole
sentence or particular noun phrases. In the available corpus of texts, the emphatic particle function of
pake is much more common than its conjunctive function. Emphatic pake is especially common in
narrative texts and conversations, while the conjunction pake is comparatively rare in narrative text.
When pake has scope over the whole sentence, it usually occurs last in the sentence, and therefore is
not easily confused with the conjunction pake.","[214, 215]"
"   Atom also overlaps with ari (change of speakers in conversations). The difference is that ari
emphasizes the element of surprise or contrast.
Temporal adverbs as connectives
    Urim language has several temporal adverbs (am, wet, weti, wuten, ikga, katnukg, mpa) which
are used to mark the time when situations occur. These typically occur without an associated
conjunction and indicate temporal discontinuity; i.e. a switch to a different temporal setting.

                  ‘Just wait, you will learn it later’
     The temporal adverb am ‘now’ functions more like a conjunction. This word is one of the
commonest words in Urim spoken texts (750 occurrences in a corpus of 37 texts). Its basic meaning
is ‘now’, but if present time is really in focus, then usually other expressions are used instead (like ak
wang ti, am ti). Am seems to be especially common in discussions and other spoken texts and less
common in written texts. In spoken discussions it seems to replace the conjunction pa emphasizing
the actions suddenness or immediateness, or referring to present time.","[219, 220]"
"4.3. Semitransitive Clauses
        In many languages clauses having motion or locative verbs and locative adverbials are classified
    as intransitive. Here these clauses are called semitransitive since they are semantically and
    syntactically somewhere between transitive and intransitive clauses. The word order and functional
    structure of semitransitive clauses is very much like that of transitive clauses in Urim. Both have two
    obligatory nominal constituents situated before and after the verb.
        Dependency grammar classifies these verbs as two-place predicates since the location or goal can
    be considered semantically obligatory with verbs like ‘arrive’ or ‘be situated’. For this reason the
    goal or location in these clauses is often called locative object.(Givon 1984: 110, Lyons 1977:496) In
    Urim there are no morphological differences between direct objects of transitive clauses and locative
    objects; both are morphologically unmarked and always occur immediately following the verb.
    Optional locative arguments of the verb are marked by prepositions. The only syntactical difference
                                                                                                           159
  between direct objects and locative objects is that direct objects can be fronted while no fronting of
  locative objects has been found in our data.
      The ‘less transitive’ status of these clauses is reflected also in the use of transitive suffixes. The
  same suffix -en which can change intransitive verbs or clauses into transitive or semitransitive ones
  can also change semitransitive verbs into transitive ones. Actually deriving transitive verbs from
  semi-transitive ones is much more common in Urim than deriving transitive verbs from intransitive
  ones. Compare the following examples (10a,b) with examples (1a,b).         (10a)   Kil     rpma       kanokg.
                 he      sit.R      ground
                 ‘He sits on the ground.’
         (10b)   Kil     arpm -en kar.
                 he      sit.R - TR car
                 ‘He is waiting for the car.’
      Semitransitive clauses are here divided into three subtypes: locative clauses, directional clauses,
  and resultative clauses. The basic structure of these clause types is the same, but they differ in
  meaning, in respect to what semantic role the locative object has, and what verbs can function as
  predicates.
4.3.1.   Directioned Motion Clause
      The locative object usually encodes the goal of the motion but also sometimes encodes the source
  or starting point. Usually a motion verb (there are about 10 verbs in this special verb class) functions
  as predicate. These verbs do not exhibit a realis-irrealis mood distinction. In serial verb phrases
  some of them can function to encode locative arguments and as aspect markers (see section 3.3.6).
  Directed motion clauses are very common in Urim texts and often form clause-chains. Following are
  some examples of directional clauses.
         (11a)   Melnum pa kawor wan.
                 man      D     enter    house
                 ‘The man went into the house.’
         (11b)   Hu         angko-we        wan            kimpo.
                 water      fall.R-CNT house               roof
                 ‘Water comes in through the roof.’
         (11c)   Am      ok           kai        lukg      ise.
                 now     mouth        go         money     PERF
                 ‘Now they started to talk about money.’
                                                                                                         160         (11d)   Kil     angko kai-nar           hu
                 3sg     fall.R go-descend       water
                 ‘He fell into the water’4.3.2.   Locative Clause
      The locative clause is structurally similar to the directed motion clause but differs semantically
  and in respect to which verbs can function as predicates. This clause type can have as predicates one
  of only six posture verbs: rpma ‘sit’, rmpa ‘lie’, itna ‘stand’, rka ‘hang’, ela ‘be situated’, and
  ha ‘be around’. Any specific referent can occur as the subject, and the second argument denotes the
  location of the subject. A locative object is morphologically unmarked but sometimes a serial verb
  construction with one of the motion verbs is used to more precisely specify the location.
         (12a)   Hu       wail      paipm     ur         rmpa         ya.
                 water    big       bad       ID         lie.R        road
                 ‘There was an awfully big pool of water on the road.’
         (12b)   Yangul     rmpa        (kaino)       wrik.
                 pencil     lie.R       go.up         table
                 ‘The pencil is (up there) on the table.’
      The locative clause is often used to introduce new information. This does not have any effect on
  the word order, which seems to be very rigid just like in the directional clause. The subject always
  occurs before the verb and the locative object after it.
         (13a)   Panis      pukpuk      ur   pa      itna       kainar            pake.
                 farm       crocodile ID D           stand.R    go.down           EMP
                 ‘There is a crocodile-farm down there.’
         (13b)   Kolpa kai-kai, wapwar wekg ur                  ha -pa. Atom         ekg        la ...
                 thus     go-go       cousins    two    ID      be.R-there then      two        say
                 ‘This went on for a long time. There were two children, cousins. They said...’
      In both (13a) and (13b) the locative clause marks the beginning of a new paragraph or section in
  the text, because it introduces a new important participant or other topic to the text. If the new items
  are not topical, i.e. important in the text, they are often introduced by using an embedded locative
  clause, as in the following examples.
         (14a)   Men     kawor wan ur pa            ela    wureren        wrik    a       kirmpa

                 ‘We went into a house near the airport.’
                                                                                                              161         (14c)    Wa     bot       al-tu    ha-pa            am         wa                aye       kul ...

                  ‘And their boat they had brought...’4.3.3.   Resultative Clause
      Resultative clauses differ from other semitransitive clauses in that they can have either nominal or
  adjectival phrases as their second obligatory argument. Otherwise they are structurally similar to the
  directional clauses. Usually they have one of the same motion verbs as the predicate. There are only
  one or two verbs that occur in resultative clauses (see example 15d). Semantically the resultative
  clause always denotes some kind of change in the subject referent. The second argument expresses
  the direction or result of the change. This can be considered an extension of the semantic role GOAL
  attached to the motion verbs in their basic use. Syntactically and semantically the resultative clause is
  closely related to certain nominal clause types; the only differences being: 1) the dynamic meaning,
  and 2) the occurrence or non-occurrence of a verb (see section 4.5)7
         (15a)    Tu kai         uror            perngten.
                  3pl go         old             quickly
                  ‘They grow old quickly.’
         (15b)    Warim angko wail.
                  child fall.R big
                  ‘The child grew big.’
         (15c)    Kupm     palng         wor         kai      wam        a-kil-en.
                  1sg      arrive        good        go       hand       G-3sg-ATR

         (15c)    Kil     pa     wake          kanil
                  3sg     D      change. into moon
                  ‘She changed into the moon.’

        The characteristic of this clause type is that it has an obligatory direct object with the usual
    semantic role of affected patient or patient-of-result. Unlike locative objects, this object can be easily
    fronted for thematic purposes.. The verb in this clause can either be a non-derived transitive verb or a
    transitive verb derived by a transitivizer suffix.","[158, 159, 160, 161, 162]"

Serialized verbs expressing modal or aspectual meanings
   Most instances of of verb serialization expressing modal meanings involve the serial verb
expressing the grammatical category occurring before the clause/sentence it semantically modifies,
while those expressing aspect tend to occur following the clause they semantically modify.
Intensity expressed using ak ‘do’
The verb ak ‘do’ is used to express intensity.                  ak            angket
                  do.R          cut.R
                  ‘cut quickly’
Doing something in a group or Inceptive modality expressed by anel ‘pick’
The verb anel ‘pick’ when serialized expresses action done in a group or inceptive aspect.",[199]
"
    Coming from a direction (without the meaning of staying there first) is expressed without
existential verb:

                  3sg     go-down       road ascend
                  ‘He is coming from the direction of road’
    This phrase can also occur as a part of locative phrase.

  which have an inherent centrifugal orientation. Notice, that the verbs listed below have the component
  ‘from somewhere’ in their meaning. Two of these have corresponding forms without ang, while the
  others do not.                  ang-kark     ‘flee from, be afraid’                      (from kark ‘dislike, afraid’)

  5.4.3.   Examples of complex serial structures:
        In Urim it is possible to have multiple serial verb constructions with different functions
    juxtaposed. Consider the following examples:                      kil      kintir-kuntur no         ang -kai              ya      ha         ti

                      (This clause has two verbal aspect markers, anele ‘one by one’ and elng ‘voluntary’, and one
                      onomatopoetic verb functioning as manner adverbial)5.5. Urim conjunctions
        It is difficult to motivate a coordinating versus subordinating distinction for many of the
    conjunctions. Therefore conjunctions are described here simply on a semantic basis according to the
    type(s) of relationship they express. As is the case in many languages, some of the most common
    Urim conjunctions seem to be morphologically composed of deictic forms. These are pa, ti, pake,
    pipa and their combinations The deictic form pa has an especially wide range of conjunctive
    functions. Some prepositions and time words (like a, eng, ak, am) play a role in connecting sentences,
    as do a few verbs as well (e.g. la).
                                                                                                         208
5.5.1.   Additive conjunction (w)a
      The additive conjunction (w)a ’and’ links clauses and sentences expressing propositions that are
  only loosely related, where neither a temporal or causal relationship is particularly evident.i
      Often the clause marked by wa adds further information that is similar in nature to that of the first
  clause (‘and also’).","[205, 206, 207, 208]"

 2.12.1. The Problem of Word Boundaries in Urim
       In Urim there are some difficulties in determining whether a construction is a compound word or
   a phrase. Phonological criteria alone are not sufficient, because a grammatical phrase may
   phonologically be one word, especially idioms. On the other hand, the boundaries of a phonological
   word are not very clear in Urim. Many morphophonemic rules can be applied over a larger domain,
   some apply over a more restricted domain than phonological word. Here we will briefly consider
   various rules and other boundary marks that help to determine word boundaries in Urim.
   a) Stress
   Stress is the clearest mark of a phonological word in Urim. A phonological word can have only one
   main stress in Urim, as indicated in the following examples:
                                                                                                         107
                 ‘kol     ‘ti                                      ‘like this’
                 like     this                 ‘kol#ti                                           ‘only’
                 like-this                 ‘wris           ‘ata                              ‘only one’
                 one             only                 ki’pman ‘wris#ata                                 ‘only men’ (not ‘only one man’!)
                 man     one-only                 ‘yankipm#ok                                       ‘talk’
                 talk-mouth                 i’lkim          ‘ok                               ‘mouth of a pit’
                 pit             mouth                 ‘maur           ‘kanokg-en                        ‘a spirit living inside the ground’
                 spirit          ground-ATR                 ‘ka                 ‘maur#ka’nokg-en              ‘grasshopper sp.’
                 grasshopper         spirit-ground-ATR    However, stress is not very reliable in determining whether or not the construct is grammatically
one word, because two nouns or two verbs can be joined phonologically under one stress when no
modifiers occur in between:                 ‘wan#yun                         ‘door’
                 house-door                 ‘wan            ‘wail   ‘yun             ‘door of a big house’
                 house           big     door                 compare to:                 ‘wan#yun           ‘wail ‘ur
                 house-door         big   ID              ‘a big door’
                 elng#’kirmpi!                            ‘put (it) down!’
                 put-lie:IR                 ‘elng     wur’kapm      rm’pi!          ‘put the book down!’
                 put       paper         lie.IR
   These constructions could easily be interpreted as compounds, if it was not known that another
word could be inserted. The expressions are phonologically words but grammatically phrases.
                                                                                                      108b) Morphophonemic rules.
    Many morphophonemic rules apply over word boundaries both in compound words and in

2.6.2.      Derived Adjectives
      Adjectives formed by derivation are very common in Urim. There are a number of ways to derive
  adjectives from other words: verbs, nouns, adverbs and other adjectives.
  Adjectives derived with -et13
       The suffix -et is one of the most productive and possibly the commonest way to form adjectives.
  It can be added to verbs, nouns, and other adjectives.
  Verb + et --> Adjective  13      -et has several other allomorphs: -pet, -tet, -ket, -wet (see morphophonemic rule 1.)

formed is recognizable and also occurs without the suffix. There are a few examples like watet
‘red’, lepet ‘sharp’, where the stem does not occur alone.
Adjectives derived with the attributive suffix -en14
   Suffixing with -en is another important means for deriving new adjectives. This suffix can be
added to verbs, nouns, other adjectives, and adverbs.

About the lexical and syntactic uses of -en:
   The suffix -en is highly productive and can probably form an attributive modifier out of any
semantically suitable noun.                 anong         nang-en
                 village       ridge-ATR

                 night         up -ATR
                 ‘early night’                 melnum     Maprik-en  ur
                 person     Maprik-ATR ID
                 ‘a man from Maprik’    When added to a noun, the suffix -en usually has the meaning ‘belonging to something or
somebody’ or ‘with’. In this meaning the suffix is often more syntactic than lexical. One function of
he suffix possibly is to bind the parts of nominal phrases together:                 kilpakg       miring-en

                  night        day-ATR/with
                  ‘by day and night’Note that the suffix -en is also used to mark the specifying or part-of-whole noun of a noun complex:
                  okmilip        yipuk-en
                  tongue         top-ATR

                  ‘the meaning of talk’ (yiprokg ‘base, root; origin’)    In many cases the addition of -en to an adjective forms another lexical adjective or at least
changes the semantic meaning of the adjective slightly, but in some cases it is hard to detect what is
the semantic difference between the form with -en and the one without it. One possible explanation is
that the addition of -en emphasizes the adjective (see the similar use of -en with possessive pronouns;
Section 2. 4. 1. 3). Another explanation is that the addition of –en somehow metaphorically extends
the meaning; for example from physical bigness to a more abstract kind of bigness:                  marpm       wusok
                  money       small
                  ‘small amount of money’                  marpm          pa       wusok-en

Adjectives derived with -is and -e
    Some adjectives are derived by adding the suffix -is to a noun referring to the item or substance
having the property of the adjective. Only rarely does -is form adjectives from other word classes
than nouns. The suffix is not very productive anymore, which can be seen in the fact that there are a
number of cases where the bound formative of an adjective formed by -is does not occur in isolation
                                                                                                        65anymore. Adjectives formed by - is are far less common than adjectives formed by -et or –en, but
many of them are common lexemes.

-e that is used with verbs to mark transitivity or continuity. The idea of continuity or permanence can
be thought to exist also between the source noun and resulting adjective in the following examples:15     The consonant /m/ disappears for some reason; compare to kinipm-et ‘not growing a big garden’.

2.6.3.      Comparison of Adjectives
      In Urim, there is no morphological means of expressing degrees of properties. Instead, various
  phrasal constructions are used. A common device is the addition of a form identical to the adjective
  paipm ‘bad’ after the adjective to express ‘very’. Frequently, the form namput ‘mention’ is also
  interposed between the adjective and paipm. When namput paipm is not preceded by an adjective, it
  has the meaning ‘very good’. With adjectives, however, it strengthens the goodness of the property
  they encode. Sometimes also the word maur ‘spirit’ or the expression maur alkil is used in the same
  meaning. This expression can also be used with adverbs.                    kalkut       paipm
                    heavy        bad
                    ‘very heavy’                    kiin      wor    namput         paipm
                    woman good       mention        bad
                    ‘a very good woman’                    kinipis       maur
                    stingy        spirit
                    ‘awfully stingy’                    watipmen maur (al-kil)
                    plenty      spirit (G-3sg)
                    ‘very much’      Some adjectives have their own special intensifiers. For example, the word manten (< man
  ‘main, principal, major’) is used after the adjective wail ‘big’ to express hugeness. In the same way
  the word mileng ‘very’ is used with the adjective watin ‘long’; watin mileng ‘very long’.
                                                                                                          67                  Kil     wail        man-ten

                  ’Its neck is very long’   When two particular referents are compared with respect to some property, a serialized
construction containing the verb angen ‘surpass’ is used:                  Kil      wail      angen    -topm
                  3sg      big       surpass.R-1sg.O
                  ‘He is bigger than me’To express superlative notions, a similar construction is used:                  Kil      wail angen           men plalng-ten
                  2sg      big    surpass.R 1pl.Exc finish-ATR
                  ‘He is the biggest of us all’    The forms waiketn /waikotn ‘small, a little’, or its shorter forms ketn/kotn, or the reduplicated
forms waiketnketn/waikotnkotn, ketnketn/kotnkotn are used adverbially to indicate possession of a
property to a small degree.","[60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]"

         Prepositions are defined as uninflected forms, which take a noun phrase complement and serve as
    a mediating form between the noun phrase and the predicate, specifying its semantic role in the
    predication. In Urim, there is only one ‘real’ preposition: eng.11 It is used to encode nearly all
    oblique/peripheral arguments in the clause encoding a wide variety of semantic roles, including: 1)
    Benefactive, 2) Recipient, 3) Locative Goal, 4) Purpose, 5) Reason, and 6) ‘about/concerning’. In
    most cases eng appears to mark the referential domain with respect to which the predicate is true or
    applicable. Perhaps this is its most basic meaning.
         The form eng alternates with another, rarer form ekg. In the Kukwo dialect and in the western
    villages of the Yangkolen dialect, this other form is more commonly used for these functions.",[50]

                  woman) modifying the head noun por ‘story’    When some essentially extraneous information is added about the Head Noun (information that
does not specify its referent) an independent clause or an apposition is often used instead of RC. In
the following example, the new person is introduced using both a relative clause and a ‘normal’
descriptive clause:

                      was a good, a good-hearted man. He arrived...’         Relative clauses frequently are quite complex and may occur for example embedded into a
     genitive phrase or coordinated as modifiers of the same NP. Relative clauses provide a way to
     background less-important information so that the main story line remains in focus:                      Kol atopen       tiur    a mentepm a          itna        kanokg        ti..

                      ‘I want to tell you about the day we came and what we saw and did on that day’5.2. Complement clauses
         Complement clauses are embedded subordinate clauses, which function as core arguments of
     certain verbs.
         Clauses functioning as subjects or objects are quite common in Urim with all verbs. Most verbs
     of communication take clausal objects.
  5.2.1.    About lexical and clausal nominalization in Urim
        The term ‘nominalization’ means in essence ‘turning something into a noun’. It can mean one of
     two things, either “the process of forming a noun from some other word class or the derivation of a
     NP from an underlying clause” (Crystal 1985). Here we will focus on the second sense of
     nominalization, as the formal process by which clauses are changed so that they can also function as
     Heads of a noun phrase.
                                                                                                    178
     Urim seems to have no formal morphological devices to form lexical nouns from verbs or
adjectives. Both simple verbs and whole clauses can function as NPs without any overt change in their
morphological structure. Many lexemes freely function as both nouns and verbs, so that it is difficult
to tell which category is more basic. Others seem to be basically verbs but can function also as heads
of NPs.","[176, 177, 178]"

There seem to be several factors involved in the placement of the vowel, which have different rankings:
1. Avoid 3 syllable verbs (most important)
2. Avoid vowel clusters **VV
3. Avoid syllable final consonant clusters **CC
4. Avoid syllable initial consonant clusters **...CC
5. Place the vowel as near to the front of the root as possible (least important).
The forms occurring are those, which best satisfy these principles. If it is not possible to satisfy all of them, then forms
which violate the lower principles are preferred to those which violate the higher ranked ones.

2.2.2. Reduplication of Verb Stems to Encode Imperfective Aspect: i.e,
    Repeated, Continual, or Habitual Action
       In Urim reduplication is a common morphological device in all word classes. It functions both
  inflectionally and derivationally. Reduplication of verb stems is used to express imperfective aspect;
  i.e. habitual, repetitive, or continuative/durative action. The exact type of aspect that reduplication
  encodes depends partly on the semantic type of the verb. With punctiliar verbs reduplication encodes
  repeated actions; topratopra ‘jump several times’. With verbs encoding more continuous motion
  reduplication marks durativity; kai-kai-kai ‘keep on going’. With transitive verbs reduplication may
  encode either habitual or durative aspects, but sometimes is also used to express added intensity.
  When reduplication encodes habitual aspect, the verb stem is repeated only once, but in reduplications
  expressing repetition or continuity/duration, the verb stem can be repeated several times depending
  how much the speaker wants to emphasize the length of the action. Reduplicated verbs often occur
  between two clauses expressing that the action continues until something else happens or until the end
  of the process is reached.
  Examples of habitual aspect:                    Pikekg ak wang           hep       pa tu           al    al       melnum

  Examples of repetitive-continual aspect:

                      1sg       shoot.R-shoot.R-shoot.R in.vain

                      ‘I kept hitting and hitting it with the bow, until it died’
  Examples of reduplication expressing durative aspect.
                      Wakg angko al             nar       kai Mayen yilo        pa        kaing-kaing-kai

                      ‘We went on sleeping until the sun was risen’     Phonologically, reduplication is usually complete, but it can also be partial. In the following
  example only the reciprocal pronoun is reduplicated (not the verb itself) to encode durative aspect:                      Ekg      erkisen        tita       tita
                      two      persuade.R     REC        REC
                      ‘They kept persuading each other.’      Reduplication is also a derivational device in Urim. Especially onomatopoetic and descriptive
  verbs are often reduplicated stems.
                      klilngklulng ‘wriggle’
                      pingpong      ‘crack’         There are also a few verbs derived from other verbs by reduplication:
                      ari      ‘see’       ariri    ‘watch’
                      compare to:          ari-ari ‘keep on looking, stare’                      pirng    ‘run to’    pirpir   ‘run’
2.2.3.     Imperfective Aspect Suffix -e
       The suffix –e has both grammatical and derivational uses. It occurs in relative clauses when the
  relative noun has the role of Locative Object within the relative clause, and serves to disambiquate the
  relative clause from a chained clause. Since the principal function of this suffix is to express
  continuity or habituliaty, it can only be used when the relative clause is semantically compatible with
  it (see section 5.1.5.2).

                   ‘Helicopter pilot’    Sometimes a verb stem can exhibit two –e suffixes in succession.                   kipm melnum a        nungkulkg atn         -e -we       pa, kipm itning    o!

                   village bad           REL   fire        stand.R-CNT-TR
                   ’place of fire, hell’     Since the first part of the verb form atne already expresses duration ‘stay a long time’, the second
-e can either be a second instance of the imperfective adding a further habitual component (‘used to
stay a long time’) or a transitive suffix referring to the location of the subject or Head of RC. Here it
is interpreted as transitive suffix referring to the head NP of relative clause, which is at the same time
the locative object of the verb in RC.
   Derivationally, the suffix -e is especially common in verbs expressing movement and location.
Consider the following examples:     ari      ‘see’        ari-we          ‘know’                (continuity or transitivity)
     alil     ‘plant’      alil-e          ‘pile up’             (action repeated)
     akul     ‘wipe’       akul-e          ‘cut road’            (action repeated until goal reached)
     alupm    ‘put into’   alupm-e         ‘fill’                (action repeated until goal reached)
     no       ‘come up’    no-we           ‘to dress’            (transitivity)
     nar      ‘come down’ nar-e            ‘drop down(tr)/flow down’          (continuity/transitivity)
     kaino    ‘go up’     kaino-we         ‘climb up’                  (transitivity)
     angko    ‘fall’       angko-we        ‘fall purposefully’          (transitivity)
     rpma       ‘sit’      arpm-e          ‘wear/sit a long time or habitually’        (transitivity,
                                                                        habitual, continuity)
     rka      ‘hang’           ark-e       ‘prick, hang a long time’              (transitivity,
                                                                                  continuity)
     tna      ‘stand’          atn-e       ‘perform magic/stay a long time’ (transitivity,
                                                                                  continuity)    These examples of derivational uses of -e seem to indicate that the suffix -e is used to express
both continuity/duration/habitual and alter transitivity. Adding the suffix -e to the verb stem quite
often increases its transitivity. It is often used to change semitransitive verbs to fully transitive verbs.
                                                                                                             28  Semitransitive verbs are those verbs expressing motion or location, which have an obligatory
  complement with the semantic role of goal, source or location. This second argument is
  morphologically unmarked like the object of full transitive verbs (see the Chapter 4).
  Conclusion:
      The suffix -e is most probably imperfective (usually expressing duration) when used
  inflectionally. If the suffix -e were a transitivity marker in the examples at the beginning of this
  section, its function would be not to add another object to the predication, but rather to refer back to
  the location where the action takes place much the same way as prepositions in the English
  translation. Still, most probably the inflectional -e is a durative suffix.
      When used to change the meaning of verbs this suffix has both durative and transitive functions,
  often both at the same time so that the verb form has two separate meanings.
      The fact that suffix -e can be occur twice on the same verb stem seems to suggest that there are
  actually two homophonous suffixes with partly overlapping functions.
2.2.4.   The Applicative Suffix-(e)n
    When the applicative suffix –e(n) is added to an intransitive verb, it converts it into a
  semitransitive or transitive predicate by promoting a peripheral argument into the clausal core as an
  Object. The semantic role of the promoted argument seems to be lexically determined.","[24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

         When conditional protasis is much less certain in its potential factuality, or even counterfactual,
     then the adverb kol is attached at the beginning of the protasis clause (see Section 7:6):                       Kol       huk ur pa, kupm a                 kai     ngkli        huk       eng yul

     and the apodosis, for example when the future temporal adverb mpa starts the clause:                       Kil      kinar     mpa       il       hu

         One characteristic of the Urim language is that the same phonological form can have several
     different functions without any morphological change, for example as a verb, noun and preposition..
     One of these multi-categorial words is kol(en). It functions as a preposition/complementizer
     expressing similarity ‘like’ and also as a modal adverb expressing hypothetical modality.

5.6.1.  Kol(en) functioning as a preposition or complementizer expressing
    similarity         When it expresses similarity,kol can be glossed as ‘like, similar to, as’. With this meaning it
   governs both phrases or clauses,and often co-occurs with demonstratives (kolpa ‘like that’, kol ti
   ‘like this’, kolai ‘how’ and kolti ‘only’, etc.). The longer form kolen is less common, but seems to
   have approximately the same range of uses as kol.","[232, 233, 234]"

    combination of ur and pa. In addition, there are also special clause and phrase types, which are used
    for introducing new participants.
         New items that are not topical, are usually introduced by a full noun phrase, with or without the
    indefinite quantifier ur. Ur is not used if it is clear from the context that there can be only one
    referent:                       Kil   no             minip, kaino            karpo              kwokg

    There are different ways to introduce topical new referents. Left dislocations and special
presentative constructions are used. This is especially the case at the beginning of texts, but also
happens sometimes at the beginning of a new paragraph.. When new main participants are introduced
in a narrative text, very often the combination of ur pa is used (with or without left dislocation). Here
the indefinite ur expresses that the participant is new information, while the demonstrative pa marks
the referent of the NP as topical. If the identity of the new participant is further specified by a
relative clause, pa is not used:                  Kiin    wekg ur pa         ekg     naren        ampen         tukgwain.

demonstratives , regardless of whether or not they are topical. When the introduced participants are
inherently definite NPs like pronouns or proper nouns, the beginning of a story is often marked by
adding pa or ur pa to a sentence-initial time adverbial.","[247, 248]"
"4.7. Typological Considerations
        In summary, some clear tendencies can be seen. First, SVO word order occurs in all clause types.
    Urim is a very consistent and rigid SVO-language. In particular, the position of subject is very fixed.
    In most clause types it cannot be moved after the verb or anywhere else. In certain intransitive
    clauses this is possible, but not very common. Also the position of locative object and topic is quite
    rigid. In transitive clauses the second argument, object, is easily fronted for thematic reasons. There
    is not so much danger of mixing the grammatical functions of subject and object in transitive clause,
    because the transitive subject always is the more animate and agent-like referent in the clause. As
    we have seen, the transitive subject is almost exclusively agent, and if not, this is shown by the
    structure of the clause.",[169]

                  ‘From the ancient times (we) perhaps did like that’    2) Also when occurring with NP, ai usually modifies only those NPs that function as Locative
Adverbials or Locative Objects. It is also used in time adverbials. But if the NP has the role of
Subject or Object in the clause, locative marker ai usually modifies it with the help of a relative
clause. Some exceptions do occur (see the last example):                  Kil wurekg ang -kinar            kirk         -ai     kul           no

                  ‘They shot in the same way as the people of Kukwo (which is far) used to shoot.’    3) Ai is commonly used with time adverbials referring to the length of time while the word pa
occurs with time adverbials only as a thematic particle. The near demonstrative ti ‘this,here’ and kil
‘he,this’ instead can be used demonstratively also in time expressions.","[95, 96]"

     The combination pati also refers back to something told or happened as explanation or reason, but
it differs from pa or ti in that it often refers further back than to just the previous clause or a present

‘in that case’) than plain pa or ti. In conversations pati is very common:                  Asen pa pati pa kupm hatn-hatn     hining. Ampake kupm ansil kwei ur.

        In Urim reduplication is a very common morphological device; it has both derivational and
    several different grammatical uses. In reduplication the word or stem is usually repeated once, in
    some cases several times. Almost all word classes can be reduplicated: nouns, verbs, adjectives,
    adverbs, quantifiers, etc.
        The term reduplication refers to the copying of part (or all) of a stem and by this definition can
    happen only inside a phonological word. The repetition of free forms (words) is not usually called
    reduplication, but here both are described together. In Urim it is sometimes hard to tell, whether or
    not a a repeated expression has been lexicalized. The whole process of lexicalization is a gradual
    phenomenon, a continuum, where there are often border cases between full lexemes and phrases (see
    Givon 1979 Ch.5). This is also reflected in the developing Urim writing system.
        When new words are formed by reduplication, the two parts usually form one phonological word
    and are written together. When the reduplication or repetition has grammatical functions, parts are
    usually written separately, but may also be written together. The problem whether reduplicated
    construction is one or two words can be compared to the similar problem with compounds (see
    2.12.1).
  2.13.1. The Forms of Reduplication
        Both full and partial types of reduplication occur in Urim. Usually words or stems are
    reduplicated but sometimes also whole phrases or clauses.
        In full reduplication the word or stem is repeated fully and in most cases without any phonological
    changes. If the result of reduplication is a phonological word, morphophonemic rules are applied.
    For example, homorganic stops are inserted between the parts, or there occur changes in one or more
    vowels. Also further phonological changes occur in the more lexicalized forms.
                                                                                                      115
                   wam-wam (hand-hand)           ---> wampwam ‘ten’
                   pa-pa (that-that)             ---> pipa ‘when, if’
                   hel-hel (swell-swell)          ---> helel ‘desire’.
                   wekg-wekg (two-two)            ---> wikgwikg ‘four’
                   prus-prus    (crunch-crunch) ---> prisprus ‘crackle, crunch’     In partial reduplications usually the last syllable is repeated:
                    ari-ari (see+see)                ---> ariri ‘watch’
                    kinar-kinar-kinar (go.down-go down-go down) ----> kinar-nar-nar ‘keep going down’
                    wasek-wasek (small-small)         ---> waseksek ‘very small’
      Usually the parts of reduplicated word retain their meaning but in the more lexicalized
  reduplications the meaning of parts tend to be partly bleached. For example the word kweikwei comes
  from the word kwei ‘yam type’. This is the most important tuber variety grown in the area and
  therefore the reduplicated form means generally ‘food’. The words kwei and kweikwei also have a
  more general meaning: ‘something, anything’. The reduplicated form kweikwei is also used as a
  general plural marker modifying noun phrases. Some lexemes have the form of partial reduplication
  but no corresponding unreduplicated form occurs: tukuk ‘sorcery’; walelel ‘cicada’. In Urim most
  onomatopoetic words are reduplicated in form. The parts of these words usually have no independent
  meaning; warwar ‘shake’.","[113, 114, 115]"

5.3.4.   Purpose-reason clauses marked by eng
      The basic function of the word eng is to mark oblique arguments. As a preposition, it governs
  especially indirect objects (mostly Benefactive and Recipient roles) and also some direct objects of
  less transitive verbs. To show the range of eng, I will first present here some examples of its use
  governing noun phrases and then examples of its use as a complementizer within subordinate clauses.
  Eng with noun phrases and clauses
     Prepositional phrases with eng are used to encode various types of Oblique arguments. It is
  commonly used to encode Benefactive-Recipient and Subject Matter ‘about/concerning’:                   Uwi        pa iye           kul      eng      kupm!

Subject referent is very generic or indefinite. Indefinite reference is sometimes also expressed by zero
anaphora, if some other NP is in the topic position in the clause. Third person singular indefinite
referents are also often expressed by using the noun kamel ‘body’ (comp. old English!) at least in the
object position. The third person plural pronoun tu is also used within the noun phrase to encode
plurality of human (or at least animate) entities (see section 2. 3. 1. 1)                  Tu awi       nampro a          tu     ak     alm       melnum amo pa

                  mosquito bite         body
                  ‘Mosquitoes bite men’ (generic reference)    The third person singular person pronoun kil sometimes functions as a demonstrative pronoun
instead of the near demonstrative ti, and may in this function be attached to other singular pronouns or
nouns (see also the first example above). In this function kil can refer both to animate and inanimate
entities:                  Kupm kil        anong           yiprokg
                  1sg       here village          origin

                  cloth        3sg/this tight
                  ‘This piece of clothing is tight!’    In Urim, personal pronouns may be modified by demonstratives and quantifiers. When the far
demonstrative pa occurs modifying a personal pronoun, this construction has thematic function. The
demonstrative pa is used with personal pronouns to emphasize, express contrast, and mark something
as topical. This last function of pa makes it possible that in Urim texts two persons can be referred by
personal pronouns all the way through after initial introduction, even when the actor or speaker
changes:                  Kupm asen kil pa om:.... Ari kil pa la-la:...
                  1sg      ask.R 3sg D now           but 3sg D say-say

                  ‘Do you have a fire like we here?’ (contrast, emphasis)Personal pronouns may also occur as part of coordinated and complex noun phrases:                  Wang     ur pa         mentekg Karis         hel    kainil
                  time     ID D          1du      Karis        roam moon

                  ‘Later we two will go’
Object Pronominal Clitics
    The Object pronominal clitics are phonologically adjoined to the verb. They conflate the non-
singular number categories of the free pronouns, distinguishing only: 1) first, second, and third
persons, and 2) singular versus non-singular numbers.","[40, 41, 42]"

                    Compare the preceding two examples to the following one, where a paraphrastic
                    relationship is expressed via simple juxtaposition without wa:                    Kupm atning        waiketn, ake kupm            atning      watipmen

                    ‘I understand only a little, I do not understand much (language)’
      Wa also binds together two clauses expressing successive, loosely connected actions without any
  causative or other dependent relationship. The following two examples are from a written text where
  the short form of the conjunction a is used:                    Atom sipsip pa pir-ng            kaino   a           nar          am     itna       pake.

                    ‘Jim came down, parked the car, and he came out.’
      Wa can occur sentence initially. In this position it is not always easy to separate it from the
  unstressed form of pa that is often weakened into [wa].
                                                                                                                209                       A men       ari   hunokg ak    wang a   men     kai hokg kai Madang

  atom wa ‘and then’ and ari wa ‘but then’. In this combination wa often has the meaning ‘again,

5.5.2.      Non-serialized clauses conjoined without any overt conjunction
      It is quite common in Urim to simply juxtapose coordinated, non-serialized clauses without any
  overt conjunction. Juxtaposed, non-serialized clauses are distinguished from verb serialization
  constructions by intonation. Pauses usually occur between coordinated clauses, never in
  serializations. Often there is rising intonation on the last word of each non-final coordinated clause,
  especially in lists. In lists, juxtaposition of the conjuncts is the norm:                       Tu    kai nangnang, howen nim, antokg kweikwei               kol-pa, tu atopen.
                       3pl go singsing beat drum do.R                things         like-that 3pl rejoice.R
                       ‘They go to singsings, beat drums, do things like that, they get joy (from those things)’         When a second clause/sentence is a paraphrase of the first, it is typically just juxtaposed.","[208, 209]"
"It is also possible for the free pronouns to occur in the Object slot. Compare the following examples:                  Tu           or-opm
                  3pl          hit-1sgO
                  ‘They hit me’                  Tu     or kupm ti-ke!

                  ‘It was me they hit!’                  Atom          kupm       la     nak -el: ...
                  then          1sg        say    tell.R-3sgO
                  ‘Then I told to him:...’                  Atom kupm la naki kil pa                  la-la: ....
                  then    1sg      say tell.R 3sg D         say-say
                  ‘Then I told told to him:...’ (changing topic)    A bound pronominal Object is used when there is no need to highlight the pronoun for purposes
of contrast, emphasis, etc. The free pronoun is always used if any modifier co-occurs with the Object
pronoun. In the example immediately above, the demonstrative pronoun pa is used either for
emphasis or because the actor changes after this clause.
    What is said here applies also when a personal pronoun is used to refer to a peripheral clausal
argument (its semantic role typically being Recipient-Benefactive or Locative-Goal) . It is promoted
to core argument in the form of bound pronoun when the referent is an already activated topic that is
simply being maintained. All uses of the bound Object pronouns are thematically unmarked ‘normal’
uses. The use of a free pronoun in this position indicates extra prominence or emphasis on the referent
(for more examples see Section 2.2.4).
    The object pronominal clitics also occur as the result of a syntactic process of possessor
ascension, which lifts the possessor of an inalienable noun (usually a body part) out of the noun
phrase to serve as the Object of the verb. It is possible to have both the Object clitic and a co-
referential genitive pronoun if the possessor referent is especially emphasized or in focus, as in the
second example below:

                 ‘He hit me in the eye’    When the verb and body part form a lexical unit, the Object pronominal clitic is obligatory. This
might be the origin of the use of suffix -el in idioms and lexemes as adverbializer. Compare
especially the two first examples below:                 Kitn aro -wopm won ok                anong-en        Urim

Genitive Pronouns
    The genitive pronouns exhibit the same person, number, and exclusive-inclusive distinctions as
the independent pronouns, being formed by phonologically adjoining the relative clause
complementizer a to a following independent pronoun. In essence, then, genitives in Urim are
formally a kind of minimal relative clause: pig that (is) I/mine = my pig.
    In addition, one or both of the following two modifications to the pronominal forms are possible:
1) the attributive suffix -en may be added to them, and 2) an /l/ may be added between the relative
clause complementizer a and the independent pronominal form. Thus, there are four possible forms
for each genitive pronoun. 8Person      Singular                 Dual                      Paucal     Plural
1           a(l)kupm(en)             a(l)mentekg(en)                      a(l(p))men(en) (Exc)
                                                               a(l)minto(wen)
                                                                          a(l)mentepm(en) (Inc)
2         a(l)kitn)en)        a(l)kipmekg(en)         a(l)kipmteng(en)    a(l)kipm(en)

    The genitive pronouns occur following the noun and indicate relationships like: 1) kinship, 2)
body parts, 3) ownership, 4) production, 5) belongingness, 6) Exclusion/Emphatis (only the forms
containing the consonant /l/ but lacking the suffix; alkupm etc.).","[43, 44, 45]"
